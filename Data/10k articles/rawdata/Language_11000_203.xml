The '''Academia Mexicana de la Lengua''' (variously translated as the '''Mexican Academy of Language''', the '''Mexican Academy of the Language''', the '''Mexican Academy of Letters''', or glossed as the '''Mexican Academy of the Spanish Language'''; acronym '''AML''') is the [[Association of Spanish Language Academies|correspondent academy]] in [[Mexico]] of the [[Real Academia Española|Royal Spanish Academy]]. It was founded in [[Mexico City]] on 11 September 1875 and, like the other academies, has the principal function of working to ensure the purity of the [[Spanish language]]. Academy members have included many of the leading figures in Mexican letters, including philologists, grammarians, philosophers, novelists, poets, historians and humanists.

The Academia Mexicana organized the first Congress of the Spanish Language Academies that was celebrated at [[Mexico City]] in April 1951. This gave birth, through its Permanent Commission, to the Association of Spanish Language Academies, confirmed in the second Congress, celebrated in [[Madrid]] five years later.

== Objectives ==
According to its statutes, approved in the plenary session of 2 December 1931, and what is disposed in the text of constitution as a civil association, from 1952, the objectives of the Academy are as follows:

# To watch over the conservation, the purity and the improvement of the Spanish language.
# To keep constant communication of scientific or literary nature with the similar academies and institutions.
# To form and increase its library, especially with those scientific and literary works that best favor the achievements of the purposes of the Academia.
# To promote and propagate the study of the Spanish language though periodic private sessions; public sessions and conferences; congresses and any other acts typical of the institute, being able to send delegates from its heart to achieve this ends.
# To attend consultations by public institutions and private individuals.
# To promote before the authorities or institutions or private individuals all that favors the conservation, the purity and the improvement of the Castilian language.

To achieve its objectives, the Academy takes abroad several studies and activities related to its competence, in plenary form as well as though its assigned especialized commissions.

== Composition and operation ==

Originally, the Academy was created with 12 members, but now has 36 full members ''(académicos de número)'' and 35 correspondent members ''(académicos correspondientes)'' based outside Mexico City. It may also have up to an additional five honorary members ''(académicos honorarios),'' who may be either Mexican citizens or foreigners.

It has a Board made up by a Director, a Secretary, a Censor, a Librarian-Archivist and a Treasurer, all chosen among the ''académicos de número'' by absolute majority of votes from the academics that attend the session in which they are to be elected, in secret voting.

The labour of the Academy is performed in a meeting, that celebrates its sessions twice or more monthly.The sessions are private or public, the first ones can be ordinary or extraordinary, and the public ones have the characteristic of solemnity when the Academy agrees it. The nature of the jobs that are analyzed and discussed in the heart of the meeting are of lexicographic, linguistic and literary importance.

The Academy owns a wide library. Its initial fund comes from the acquisition of the former library of the academic Don Alejandro Quijano. With the years the number of works with relevant contributions has been growing, such as the one of the prestigious jurist and intellectual [[Alberto Vázquez del Mercado]] (1893–1980), who bestowed the institution with a huge and valuable collection of historic and literary works. In addition the books published donated by the academics, there are to be found those sent by the Real Academia Española, the other Spanish-language academies, some publishing companies and book stores, as well as those sent by official and private cultural organizations.

== Activities and projects ==
From its creation, the work of the academy has been documented with the publication of the Memories and a Yearbook.

In the Memories appear the works read by the members of the Academy in the meetings and others that, according to their judgement, are worth of publishing. Each volume starts with a review of the most relevant happenings that have occurred since the publication of the previous one and the indication of the number of attendance to the meetings of each academic, and concludes with general and alphabetic indexes.

The Academy publishes a Yearbook where it communicates the changes in academics and also all sort of works related to the institute.

Likewise, it is concerned with the research of the use of the Spanish language in Mexico, which has crystallized in the publication of different works of reference. Among them, the most important are:

* The ''Universal Dictionary of Geography'' (1997), that contains the names in Spanish of several geographical entities from around the world and their demonyms. It includes, for information purposes, the names in the language or languages of the country they are talking about, if they are normally written in Latin alphabet, or Latinized if in their region it is used a different writing system.
* The ''Mexican Book of Sayings'' (2004), that has its origins in an extensive project that the Academy started to commemorate its 125th anniversary. After some hard work, they finally published the Index of Mexicanisms (2000), a wide collection of sayings used in Mexico from the beginnings of the 19th century until nowadays and that has become a fundamental reference book to the study of the Spanish spoken in the country. This Index, generated two works: the Short Dictionary of Mexicanisms (2001), with 6,200 lexicographical articles that include words, phrases and even certain lexical elements, by [[Guido Gómez de Silva]], and the Mexican Book of Sayings, product of the work of several Academic researches.

Because of its vocation of constantly adaptation with the new technologies and in harmony with the new communications society, the Academia Mexicana de la Lengua has included the forementioned works in its webpage so that they can be consulted in an interactive manner, belonging to the [[Association of Spanish Language Academies]].

According to the law, the term '''adjustment''' may appear in varied contexts, as a synonym for terms with unrelated definitions:

==General Definition==
Adjust:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;quoting BALLENTINE'S LAW DICTIONARY Copyright (c) 1969 Lexis Law Publishing, a division of Reed Elsevier, plc.&lt;/ref&gt; 
# To settle or to bring to a satisfactory state, so that the parties are agreed in the result; as, to adjust accounts.&lt;ref&gt;State ex rel. Sayre v Moore, 40 Neb 854, 59 NW 755.&lt;/ref&gt;
# When applied to a liquidated demand, the verb "adjust" has the same meaning as the word "settle" in the same connection, and means to pay the demand. When applied to an unliquidated demand, it means to ascertain the amount due or to settle. In the latter connection, to settle means to effect a mutual adjustment between the parties and to agree upon the balance.&lt;ref&gt;State v Staub, 61 Conn 553, 568.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common Uses==

===General Debt===
*Debtor and creditor adjustment:  As the term appears in an assignment for the benefit of creditors, "Creditor" means one who has a definite demand against the assignor, or a cause of action capable of adjustment and liquidation at trial. 6 Am J2d Assign for Crs § 109.
*Adjustable Rate Loan: Loan arrangement which permits the lender to change the interest rate based on a specific factor such as the prime lending rate charged by banks.
*Adjusting agency:  In one sense, a collection agency; in another sense, an agency representing a debtor in making an arrangement with his creditors for the settlement of his obligations by modification of the indebtedness. AUTHORITY: 15 Am J2d Collect §§ 1, 2.
*Adjusted Balance Method: Method used by a credit card issuer to compute the balance on which a debtor must pay interest. The adjusted balance method determines the outstanding balance at the beginning of the current billing cycle and then deducts payments made during that cycle.
*Cap:&lt;ref name="THE LEGAL PROFESSION THIRD EDITION Copyright 2001"/&gt;  Limit placed on the amount an interest rate or monthly payment can increase during an adjustment period or over the life of an adjustable rate loan.

===Insurance===
*Insurance adjustment, the settlement of an insurance claim; the determination for the purposes of a settlement of the amount of a claim, particularly a claim against an insurance company, giving consideration to objections made by the debtor or insurance company, as well as the allegations of the claimant in support of his claim.&lt;ref&gt;29A Am J Rev ed Ins § 1604.&lt;/ref&gt;  Adjustment of claims is not confined to claims against insurance companies. An allowance made by a creditor, particularly a storekeeper, in response to a complaint by the debtor respecting the accuracy of the account or other claim, or a reduction in the claim or account made to induce a prompt payment, is in a proper sense an adjustment.
*[[Adjustment clause]], in an insurance policy.
*[[Public adjuster]]:   One whose business is the adjustment of claims for insurance, employed, not regularly for full-time by one person or company, but by members of the public, insureds or insurers, as their need of an adjuster arises.&lt;ref&gt;AUTHORITY: Larson v Lesser, (Fla) 106 So 2d 188.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Adjuster:  A person who makes a determination of a claim, especially a claim against an insurance company, and objections made thereto by the debtor or insurance company, for the purpose of arriving at an amount for which the claim will be settled.&lt;ref&gt;First National Bank v Manchester Fire Assur. Co. 64 Minn 96, 98, 66 NW 136&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes acting as the agent of the insurance company or debtor, at other times as the agent of the claimant.&lt;ref&gt;AUTHORITY: Aetna Ins. Co. v Shryer, 85 Ind 362, 363; 7 Am J2d Attys § 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accounting===
*“Accounting”: An action, usually on the equity side, to secure an &lt;u&gt;adjustment&lt;/u&gt; of complicated accounts.&lt;ref&gt;1 Am J2d Acctg § 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Making amends or restitution.
*To determine: To terminate; to cease; to end. To put an end to controversy by deciding the issue or issues, by making a settlement, or by adjustment.&lt;ref&gt;Field v Auditor, 83 Va 882, 887&lt;/ref&gt; Same as "hear and determine" when used by statute with reference to court action, but meaning merely "ascertain," where used in matters not pertaining to judicial process.&lt;ref&gt;AUTHORITY: Ex parte Anderson, 191 Or 409, 229 P2d 633, 230 P2d 770, 29 ALR2d 1051&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principles of Law===
*“Equity delights in amicable adjustments.” &lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;   TEXT: A maxim of equity; a maxim addressed to the judicial conscience and intended to govern the court in the determination of disputes between litigants.  AUTHORITY: Troll v Spencer, 238 Mo 81, 141 SW 855.
*Settlement in pais: A settlement or adjustment of differences between the parties themselves, out of court.
*Composition,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;quoting A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage  Copyright (c) 1990 Bryan A. Garner, Oxford University Press, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; "the adjustment of a debt, or avoidance of an obligation or liability, by some form of compensation agreed on between the parties". This noun corresponds to the verb to compound, q.v., and often means merely "a compounding." E.g., "If a slave killed a freeman, he was to be surrendered for one half of the composition to the relatives of the slain man, and the master was to pay the other half." O.W. Holmes, The Common Law 17 (1881; repr. 1946).
*A contribution, or adjustment of loss.

===Immigration===
*Adjustment of Status:&lt;ref name="THE LEGAL PROFESSION THIRD EDITION Copyright 2001"&gt;MODERN DICTIONARY FOR THE LEGAL PROFESSION THIRD EDITION Copyright (c) 2001. William S. Hein &amp; Co., Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;  Transition from a non-immigrant visa status to an immigrant visa status. Some non-immigrants already in the United States can become lawful permanent residents without having to travel abroad to receive an immigrant visa from a consul. Marrying a United States citizen is one of the commonly employed techniques used by non-immigrants to achieve a status adjustment.

===Labor Law===
*Cost of Living Adjustment:&lt;ref name="THE LEGAL PROFESSION THIRD EDITION Copyright 2001"/&gt;   C.O.L.A. – Provision in a contract or law providing benefits which grants an automatic monetary increase that is directly tied to increases in the cost of living. This automatic increase is used in determining federal pensions, military pensions, and some veterans benefits.

*Zone Pricing: Adjustment of prices based on transportation costs so prices are uniform within a certain geographic area.
*Conciliation. The adjustment of disputes in a friendly manner, or, if not in a friendly manner, at least without violence. One of the primary examples of conciliation is the adjustment of labor disputes without a strike or an extended strike.&lt;ref&gt;AUTHORITY: 31 Am J Rev ed Lab § 371&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taxes===
*[[Adjusted basis]]: For income tax purposes, the original cost or other original basis adjusted for such things as [[casualty loss]]es, improvements, and depreciation, when appropriate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1632">An '''all request''' television or radio show is a show that plays only listener or viewer [[Request (broadcasting)|requests]].

The introduction to [[The Carpenters]]' version of ''[[Calling Occupants of Interplanetary Craft]]'' features a fictional dialogue between the [[disc jockey]] of an all request program on "All Hit Radio" and a listener that the DJ thinks is "Mike Ledgerwood", but is in fact an alien race.  The DJ comments that the request "We are observing your Earth" is "not on our play list".  This refers to an actual practice of all request programs of having a pre-set play list, and excluding any requests for items that are not on it.

== Examples ==
Some widely known all request shows include:
* ''All Request'' &amp;mdash; an hour-long block of programming in which the staff at [[VH1 Classic]] play video requests that they receive via electronic mail

* ''[[All Request Live]]''
* ''[[Total Request Live]]''

==Philosophical work==
Soon after his doctoral degree, Gibbard provided a first proof of a conjecture that [[strategic voting]] was an intrinsic feature of [[Arrow impossibility theorem|non-dictatorial]] voting systems with at least three choices, a conjecture of [[Michael Dummett]] and [[Robin Farquharson]]. Once established, this result has been known as the [[Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem]].&lt;ref name="Gibbard1973" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Mark A. |last=Satterthwaite |title=Strategy-proofness and Arrow's Conditions: Existence and Correspondence Theorems for Voting Procedures and Social Welfare Functions |journal=[[Journal of Economic Theory]] |volume=10 |year=1975 |issue=2 |pages=187–217 |doi=10.1016/0022-0531(75)90050-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Michael |last=Dummett |authorlink=Michael Dummett |title=Voting Procedures |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1984 |isbn=0-19-876188-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LOFRAQAAIAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gibbard is best known in philosophy for his contributions to ethical theory.  He is the author of three books in this area.  ''Wise Choices, Apt Feelings: A Theory of Normative Judgment'' (1990) develops a general [[theory]] of moral [[judgment]] and judgments of rationality. Gibbard argues that when we endorse someone's action, belief, or feeling as "rational" or warranted we are expressing acceptance of a system of norms that permits it. More narrowly, morality is about norms relating to the aptness of moral feelings (such as guilt and resentment).&lt;ref&gt;Allan Gibbard (1990). ''Wise Choices, Apt Feelings''.

:''Thinking How to Live'' (2003) offers an argument for reconfiguring the distinctions between [[Norm (philosophy)|normative]] and [[descriptive]] [[discourse]], with implications as to the "long-standing debate"[https://books.google.com/books?id=GdQmEQ4YdIwC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s] over "objectivity" in ethics and [[Fact–value distinction|"factuality" in ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;Allan Gibbard (2003).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20088">'''Baritenor''' (also rendered in [[English language]] sources as '''bari-tenor'''&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Deer and Dal Vera (2008) p. 356; Boytim (2002) p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; or '''baritenore'''&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Hubbard (1910) p. 58; Kaufman (1998); Turp (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[portmanteau]] (blend) of the words "[[baritone]]" and "[[tenor]]".&lt;ref&gt;Thurner (1993) p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to describe both baritone and tenor voices. In [[Webster's Dictionary|''Webster's Third New International Dictionary'']] it is defined as "a baritone singing voice with virtually a tenor [[vocal range|range]]".&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's Dictionary'' (1961), Vol. 1, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term was defined in several late 19th century and early 20th century music dictionaries, such as ''The American History and Encyclopedia of Music'', as "a low tenor voice, almost barytone" [''[[sic]]''].&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard (1910) p. 58. See also: Elson (1905) p. 30; Ludden (1875) p. 27; Schuberth (1880) p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

==In opera==
[[File:Andrea Nozzari in Il sogno di Partenope.jpg|left|thumb|169 px|Baritenor [[Andrea Nozzari]] as Poliflegante in [[Simon Mayr|Mayr]]'s ''Il sogno di Partenope'']]
Baritenor (or its [[Italian language|Italian]] form, ''baritenore'') is still used today to describe a type of [[tenor]] voice which came to particular prominence in [[Rossini]]'s operas.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Celletti (1996) p. 163; Turp (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; It is characterized by a dark, weighty lower octave and a ringing upper one but with sufficient agility for [[coloratura]] singing.&lt;ref&gt;Milnes (1992) p. 1095&lt;/ref&gt; Rossini used this type of voice to portray noble (and usually older), leading characters, often in contrast to the higher, lighter voices of the [[tenore di grazia]] or the [[tenore contraltino]] who portrayed the young, impetuous lovers.&lt;ref&gt;Badenes (2005) p. 28; Teatro La Fenice (2005) p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this contrast can be found in his ''[[Otello (Rossini)|Otello]]'' (1816), where the role of Otello was written for a baritenore ([[Andrea Nozzari]]), while the role of Rodrigo, his young rival for the affections of Desdemona, was written for a tenore di grazia ([[Giovanni David]]). Nozzari and David were paired again in Rossini's ''[[Ricciardo e Zoraide]]'' (1818), with a similar contrast in characters – Nozzari sang the role of Agorante, King of Nubia, while David portrayed the Christian knight, Ricciardo. Other notable baritenors of this period beside Nozzari were [[Gaetano Crivelli]], [[Nicola Tacchinardi]], [[Manuel García (tenor)|Manuel García Sr.]] and [[Domenico Donzelli]]&lt;ref&gt;Celletti (1996) p. 82-94.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian musicologist, [[Rodolfo Celletti]] (d. 2004), proposed that the Rossinian baritenor was nothing new to opera. According to Celletti, the tenor voices used for leading roles in early [[baroque opera]]s such as [[Jacopo Peri]]'s ''[[Euridice (opera)|Euridice]]'' (1600) and [[Claudio Monteverdi]]'s ''[[Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria]]'' (1640) were essentially "baritenor" ones with a range common to both the baritone and tenor voices of today.&lt;ref&gt;Celletti (1989) p. 19 and Celletti (1996) p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; In his 2009 book, ''Tenor: History of a voice'', [[John Potter (musician)|John Potter]] refers to this type of voice as "tenor-bass" and notes that several virtuoso singers of the 17th century who were described as "tenors" by their contemporaries could also sing in the [[bass (voice type)|bass]] register: [[Giulio Caccini]], [[Giuseppino Cenci]], [[Giovanni Domenico Puliaschi]] and [[Francesco Rasi]].&lt;ref&gt;Potter (2009) pp. 17-18&lt;/ref&gt; Rasi created the title tole in Monteverdi's first opera, ''[[L'Orfeo]]'' (1607),&lt;ref&gt;Whenham (1986) p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; which in modern times has been sung by tenors such as [[Anthony Rolfe Johnson]]&lt;ref&gt;Whenham (1986) p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by lyric baritones, such as [[Simon Keenlyside]].&lt;ref&gt;Holland (12 June 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Based on their descriptions in [[Vincenzo Giustiniani]]'s ''Discorso sopra la musica'' (1628), Potter has suggested that singers such as Caccini, Cenci, Puliaschi, and Rasi, employed an "open speech-like sound" which facilitated the agility and clarity of expression for which their voices were renowned.&lt;ref&gt;Potter (2009) p. 17. See Wistreich (2007) p. 198 for Giustiniani's descriptions.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Jean de Reszke2.jpg|thumb|190 px| Tenor [[Jean de Reszke]] who originally trained as a baritone]] 
With the rise of the [[castrato]] singer in Italian opera, the baritenor voice came to be perceived as "ordinary" or even "vulgar" and was relegated to portraying character roles – villains, grotesques, old men, and even women.&lt;ref&gt;Celletti (1996) p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Although there were exceptions, such Dario in Vivaldi's ''[[L'incoronazione di Dario]]'' (created by the tenor [[Annibale Pio Fabri]]),&lt;ref&gt;Casaglia (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; the leading male roles (and especially that of the romantic lover) in Italian operas of the middle and late baroque era were largely written for the high, exotic voices of the castrati.&lt;ref&gt;This was not the case in France, however, where there was a distaste for castrati in such roles. See Heriot (1975) p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;  In French opera of the same period, the baritenor voice, called the ''taille'' (or ''haute-taille'') before the term ''ténor'' came into general use, was little used for important solo parts, although possibly more often than in Italian opera. Because of the general dislike for the castrato voice in France, young lover roles were assigned to the high male voices of [[Haute-contre|hautes-contre]].&lt;ref&gt;Potter, p. 19; Heriot (1975) p. 13; for the usage of French terminology, see also: L. Sawkins, art. "Haute-contre", and O. Jander, J.B. Steane, E. Forbes, art. "Tenor", in ''New Grove Dictionary'', II, pp. 668/669, and III, p. 690&lt;/ref&gt; Today the ''taille'' roles are most often performed by baritones.

==In vocal pedagogy==
[[Vocal pedagogy|Vocal pedagogues]] such as [[Richard Miller (singer)|Richard Miller]] use the term to refer to a common voice category in young male singers whose [[tessitura]] (most comfortable vocal range) lies between that of a baritone and that of a tenor and whose [[passaggio|passage zone]] lies between [[C (musical note)|C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[F (musical note)|F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller (2008) p. 10. See also: Boytim (2002) p. 45; Frisell (2007) p. 64; Blier (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; Such singers can evolve, either naturally or through training, into [[Baritone#Bariton.2FBaryton-Martin|high baritones]], suitable for operatic roles such as Pelléas in ''[[Pelléas et Mélisande (opera)|Pelléas et Mélisande]]''. Alternatively, they may evolve into [[Tenor#Tenor buffo or Spieltenor|spieltenors]], suitable for character roles such as Pedrillo in ''[[The Abduction from the Seraglio]]'' or into ''[[Tenor#Heldentenor|heldentenors]]'' who sing leading roles such as Siegmund in ''[[Die Walküre]]'' or Florestan in ''[[Fidelio]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Miller (2008) p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; In both these types of tenor roles the highest notes of the tenor range are rarely required, and the voice usually has a baritonal weight in the lower notes. Several famous tenors who have sung the dramatic tenor and ''heldentenor'' repertory originally began their careers as baritones, including [[Jean de Reszke]],&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal and Warrack (1979) p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; [[Giovanni Zenatello]],&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal and Warrack (1979) p. 558&lt;/ref&gt; [[Renato Zanelli]],&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal and Warrack (1979) p. 556&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lauritz Melchior]],&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal and Warrack (1979) p. 319&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erik Schmedes]],&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal and Warrack (1979) p. 446&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Plácido Domingo]],&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal and Warrack (1979) p. 137; Tommasini (27 September 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of his career, Domingo returned to the baritone repertoire when he sang the title role in ''[[Simon Boccanegra]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Scott (13 August 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Self-described as "a bastard bari-tenor",&lt;ref&gt;''Time'' 7 December 1959&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter Slezak]] (the son of operatic tenor [[Leo Slezak]]), was primarily a stage and film actor, but he also sang tenor roles in musicals and [[operetta]]s and appeared at the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in 1959 as Zsupán in ''[[The Gypsy Baron]]''.

==In musical theatre==
[[File:Noël Coward 01.jpg|thumb|right|170 px|[[Noël Coward]], whose singing voice has been described as "a distinctive baritenor" &lt;ref&gt;Traubner (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Despite being described in ''Acting the Song: Performance Skills for the Musical Theatre'' as a term "coined" by "musical theatre [[Sociolect|vernacular]]",&lt;ref&gt;Moore and Bergman (2008) p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; the use of ''baritenor'' in relation to the operatic voice can be seen in English sources since at least 1835, and French ones since 1829.&lt;ref&gt;Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge (1835) Vol. 3, p. 524; Fétis (1829) Vol. 4. p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the term is widely used in [[musical theatre]] to describe a [[baritone]] voice capable of singing notes in the [[tenor]] range, and was used as early as 1950 to describe the voice of [[Eddie Fisher (singer)|Eddie Fisher]] in a [[variety show]] at New York's [[Paramount Theater (New York City)|Paramount Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;''Billboard'' (26 August 1950) p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Deer and Dal Vera have noted that by 2008, the majority of leading roles in [[rock musical]]s were being written for baritenors.&lt;ref&gt;Deer and Dal Vera (2008) in p. 356&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst the roles specifying baritenor voices in [[Casting (performing arts)|casting calls]] between 2008 and 2010 were: Tom Collins (''[[Rent (musical)|Rent]]''),&lt;ref&gt;Encore Theater Company&lt;/ref&gt; Bob and Tommy (''[[Jersey Boys]]'');&lt;ref&gt;Maupin (3 March 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Wizard, Cowardly Lion, Scarecrow, and Tinman (''[[The Wiz]]'');&lt;ref&gt;Playbill (March 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Max Bialystock and Leopold Bloom (''[[The Producers (musical)|The Producers]]'');&lt;ref&gt;actorsingers.org (January 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; and Thomas Weaver and Alvin Kelby (''[[The Story of My Life (musical)|The Story of My Life]]'').&lt;ref&gt;New York Theatre Guide (8 April 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eric Salzman|Saltzman]] and Dési ascribe the rise of the baritenor voice in musical theatre to the introduction of [[Sound reinforcement system|amplification]] in the second half of the 20th century. Prior to that, the leading roles were predominantly sung by tenors and [[soprano]]s with even the baritone characters tending to sing in the upper part of their range. This was due not only to the popular taste of the times, but also to the fact that higher voices were more capable of riding over the orchestra and reaching the furthest seats. The introduction of amplification allowed male leading roles to be assigned to baritones, albeit ones who often had an extension into the tenor range.&lt;ref&gt;Salzman and Dési (2008) p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; David Young also notes that the baritenor voice can be particularly useful for roles such as Marius in ''[[Fanny (musical)|Fanny]]'' where the character ages significantly during the course of the musical.&lt;ref&gt;Young (1995) p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5395">'''Biodilution''', sometimes referred to as '''bloom dilution''', is the decrease in concentration of an [[Chemical element|element]] or [[pollutant]] with an increase in [[trophic level]].&lt;ref name=campbell/&gt; This effect is primarily observed during algal blooms whereby an increase in algal biomass reduces the concentration of pollutants in organisms higher up in the food chain, like [[zooplankton]] or [[daphnia]].&lt;ref name=pickhardt/&gt;

The primary elements and pollutants of concern are heavy metals such as [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[cadmium]], and [[lead]]. These toxins have been shown to [[bioaccumulate]] up a [[food web]]. In some cases, metals, such as mercury, can [[biomagnify]].&lt;ref name=campbell/&gt;&lt;ref name=rypel/&gt; This is a major concern since [[methylmercury]], the most toxic mercury species, can be found in high concentrations in human-consumed fish and other aquatic organisms.

Numerous studies have linked lower mercury concentrations in zooplankton found in [[eutrophic]] (nutrient-rich and highly productive) as compared to [[oligotrophic]] (low nutrient) aquatic environments.&lt;ref name=pickhardt/&gt;&lt;ref name=rypel/&gt; Nutrient enrichment (mainly phosphorus and nitrogen) reduce the input of mercury, and other heavy metals, into aquatic food webs through this biodilution effect. Primary producers, such as [[phytoplankton]], uptake these heavy metals and accumulate them into their cells. The higher the population of phytoplankton, the less concentrated these pollutants will be in their cells. Once consumed by primary consumers, such as zooplankton, these phytoplankton-bound pollutants are incorporated into the consumer’s cells. Higher phytoplankton biomass means a lower concentration of pollutants accumulated by the zooplankton, and so on up the food web. This effect causes an overall dilution of the original concentration up the food web. That is, the concentration of a pollutant will be lower in the zooplankton than the phytoplankton in a high bloom condition.

Although most biodilution studies have been on freshwater environments, biodilution has been shown to occur in the marine environment as well. The Northwater Polynya, located in Baffin Bay, was found to have a negative correlation of cadmium, lead, and nickel with an increase in trophic level&lt;ref name=campbell/&gt; Cadmium and lead are both non-essential metals that will compete for calcium within an organism, which is detrimental for organism growth.

Most studies measure [[bioaccumulation]] and biodilution using the δ15N isotope of nitrogen.  The δ15N isotopic signature is enriched up the food web.&lt;ref name=takeuchi/&gt;&lt;ref name=watanabe/&gt; A predator will have a higher δ15N as compared to its prey. This trend allows the trophic position of an organism to be derived. Coupled to the concentration of a specific pollutant, such as mercury, the concentration verses trophic position can be accessed.

While most heavy metals bioaccumulate, under certain conditions, heavy metals and organic pollutants have the potential to biodilute, making a higher organism less exposed to the toxin.

(2004) "''Cosmic origin of quantization''" Retrieved on 26 August 2007 from [http://www.worldscinet.com/ijmpb/18/1804n05/S0217979204024136.html WorldSciNet]. [[International Journal of Modern Physics B]], Vol. 18, Nos. 4-5 (2004) 519-525.&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Francesco Calogero]] that suggests the classical stochastic background field to which [[Edward Nelson]] attributes quantum mechanical behavior in his theory of [[stochastic quantization]] is a fluctuating space-time, and that there are further mathematical relations between the involved quantities.

The hypothesis itself suggests that if the [[angular momentum]] associated with a stochastic tremor&lt;ref name="calo_2004" /&gt; with [[Coherence (physics)#Spatial coherence|spatial coherence]] provides an action purported by that motion within the order of magnitude of [[Max Planck|Planck]]'s [[Planck constant|constant]]&lt;ref name="calo_2004" /&gt; then the order of magnitude of the associated angular momentum has the same value.&lt;ref name="calo_2004" /&gt; Calogero himself suggests&lt;ref name="calo_2004" /&gt; that these findings, originally based on the simplified model of the universe&lt;ref name="calo_2004" /&gt; "are affected (and essentially, unaffected) by the possible presence in the mass of the Universe of a large component made up of particles much lighter than nucleons".&lt;ref name="calo_2004" /&gt;

Essentially, the relation explained by Calogero can be expressed with the formulas:

:&lt;math&gt;h \approx \alpha G^{1/2} m^{3/2} [R(t)]^{1/2}.&lt;/math&gt;
Furthermore:
:&lt;math&gt;h \equiv h(t) = A \sqrt{R(t)} = h_0 \sqrt{a(t)}&lt;/math&gt; Const G,m
Where:
:&lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; represents the [[gravitational constant]]
:&lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; represents the mass of a hydrogen atom.
:&lt;math&gt;R(t)&lt;/math&gt; represents the radius of the universe accessible by gravitational interactions in time, t.
:&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a dimensional constant.

Despite its common description, it has been noted that the conjecture is not entirely defined within the realms of Nelson's stochastic mechanics, but can also be thought of as a means of inquiring into the statistical effects of interaction with distant masses in the universe and was expected by Calogero himself&lt;ref name="gaeta_1" /&gt; to be within the same order of magnitude as quantum mechanical effects.&lt;ref name="gaeta_1" /&gt;

== Analysis ==

=== Compatibility with fundamental constants ===
&lt;!-- A note to the foolish denouement of human consciousness, vis-a-vis notability, that there is a very limited amount of literature on this conjecture, and this definitive paper is the only one available which analyzes it in such a way. --&gt;
After the publication of Calogero's original paper, "[The] [c]osmic origin of quantization" a response was published by Giuseppe Gaeta of the [[University of Rome La Sapienza|University of Rome]]&lt;ref name="gaeta_1" /&gt; in which he discussed the compatibility of the conjecture with present bounds on variation of fundamental constants, but also outlined his focus on the modification of the relation between [[redshift]] and distance,&lt;ref name="gaeta_1" /&gt; and of the estimations attained from observations of elapsed time from the production of cosmic radiation and implications&lt;ref name="gaeta_1" /&gt;—both being related also, to the observed [[Black body|blackbody distribution]] of background cosmic radiation.&lt;ref name="gaeta_1" /&gt;

'''Carlos Magalhães de Azeredo''' (September 7, 1872 – November 4, 1963) was a [[Brazil]]ian poet, short story writer, diplomat and journalist. He founded and occupied the 9th chair of the [[Academia Brasileira de Letras|Brazilian Academy of Letters]], from 1897 until his death in 1963, thus being the academic that occupied his chair for the longest time (66 years) and the youngest founder of the Academy (he was 25 years old at the time).

==Life==
Azeredo was born in [[Rio de Janeiro]], in 1872, to Caetano Pinto de Azeredo (who died three months after Carlos' birth) and Leopoldina Magalhães de Azeredo. Since as a young man, Azeredo would write – when he was 12 years old he wrote a poetry book named ''Inspirações da Infância'', that was never published, and with 17 years old he started to trade letters with [[Machado de Assis]] and [[Mário de Alencar]].

He made his primary studies in the Colégio São Carlos, in [[Porto]], [[Portugal]], later returning to Brazil (more precisely to the city of [[Itu, Brazil|Itu]]), where he finished them at the [[Colégio São Luís]].

He entered the [[Faculdade de Direito da Universidade de São Paulo]] in 1888, graduating in 1893. Two years later, he entered the [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] career, where he served as minister in [[Uruguay]], [[Cuba]], [[Greece]] and the [[Holy See]]. He would stay permanently in Italy, until his death.

==Works==
Azeredo was a very proficuous writer, but his works remained unknown for some time in Brazil. In December 2003, former [[President of Brazil|Brazilian President]] and then-ambassador of Brazil in Italy [[Itamar Franco]] found some then-unpublished writings by him, delivering them to the Brazilian Academy of Letters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://clipping.planejamento.gov.br/Noticias.asp?NOTCod=94182] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928080943/http://clipping.planejamento.gov.br/Noticias.asp?NOTCod=94182 |date=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Casting Cats.jpg|thumb|Casting call for [[black cat]]s, Los Angeles, 1961. The studio was seeking cats for the [[Roger Corman]] movie ''[[Tales of Terror]].'']]

In the [[performing arts]] industry such as [[theatre]], [[film]], or [[television]], a '''casting''' (or '''casting call''') is a [[pre-production]] process for selecting a certain type of [[actor]], [[dancer]], [[singer]], or [[extra (acting)|extra]] for a particular role or part in a script, [[screenplay]], or [[teleplay]]. This process is typically utilized for a motion picture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Motion Pictures|url=https://socialbilitty.com/glossary/motion-pictures/|date=December 14, 2016|publisher=''[[Socialbilitty]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171006161746/https://socialbilitty.com/glossary/motion-pictures/|archivedate=October 6, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[television program]], [[documentary]], [[music video]], [[play (theatre)|play]], or [[television advertisement]], etc. This involvement in a dramatic production, [[advertisement]], and or [[industrial video]] is intended for an [[audience]], or [[studio audience]].

==Casting process==
The casting process involves a series of [[audition (performing arts)|audition]]s before a casting panel, composed of individuals within a [[theatrical production]] such as [[theatrical producer]], and [[theater director]]. However, within a given [[Television program#Production|television production]] a casting panel can consist of a [[television producer]], or within [[filmmaking|film production]] a casting panel could contain a [[film producer]], [[film director]], and/or [[choreographer]]. Usually, in nearly all areas of [[show business]], a casting director&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Does a Casting Director Do?|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kate-mcclanaghan/what-does-a-casting-direc_b_9799558.html|date=Apr 29, 2017|publisher=''[[Huffington Post]]''|access-date=May 21, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170526020009/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kate-mcclanaghan/what-does-a-casting-direc_b_9799558.html|archivedate=May 26, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is on this panel as well. In the early stages of this process [[performers]] often may present, or are presented with prepared ''audition pieces'' such as [[monologue]]s, [[song]]s, choreography, scripts and or sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sides|url=http://dictionary.tdf.org/sides/|date=Feb 25, 2015|publisher=''[[Theatre Development Fund ]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170517122705/http://dictionary.tdf.org/sides/|archivedate=May 17, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These audition pieces are usually video taped, typically in the form of [[screen test]]s and then attached with resumes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How do I add my resume and more information about myself?|url=https://www.imdb.com/help/show_leaf?proaddresume|date=May 21, 2017|publisher=''[[IMDb]]''|access-date=May 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[head shot]]s and or viewed online via websites such as [[IMDb]], then shared with film producers, film directors and or [[studio executive]]s. Later stages may involve groups of [[actors]] both union, ([[SAG-AFTRA]]) and non union depending on the size and scope of the production, attempting to read material from the work under consideration, paired off in various combinations of two, three or more. With each of the actor's overall [[motivational]] choices evaluated, the casting panel considers both the individual actor, and the ''chemistry'' created from either one of the combinations set forth within the [[read-through]], such as boy meets girl, etc.

Within the production of a prestigious work under consideration for film or television, and depending on the difficulty in finding a lead or supporting actor for the role, such as with the casting of the [[biopics|biopic]] films Notorious,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notorious|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0472198/|date=January 16, 2009|publisher=''[[IMDb ]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170512175935/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0472198/|archivedate=May 12, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Straight Outta Compton&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Straight Outta Compton - Number One Movie of the Summer|url=https://socialbilitty.com/2015/08/straight-outta-compton-number-one-movie-of-the-summer/|date=August 20, 2015|publisher=''[[Socialbilitty]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170307235934/https://socialbilitty.com/2015/08/straight-outta-compton-number-one-movie-of-the-summer/|archivedate=March 7, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and All Eyez on Me,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=All Eyez on Me|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1666185/|date=June 16, 2017|publisher=''[[IMDb ]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519114240/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1666185/|archivedate=May 19, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; casting calls may go out into the general public at large, this is referred to as a Cattle Call&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cattle Call|url=https://socialbilitty.com/glossary/cattle-call/|date=December 15, 2016|publisher=''[[Socialbilitty]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180213081649/https://socialbilitty.com/glossary/cattle-call/|archivedate=February 13, 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (typical for [[community theater]]), to professional and semi-professional local actors where a similar process is followed (for supporting roles in [[theater]] and [[film]]) or for specifically selected actors (for leading roles, especially in films).

Casting character breakdowns,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Write a Casting Notice|url=https://www.lightsfilmschool.com/blog/how-to-write-a-casting-call/481|date=April 2, 2013|publisher=''[[Lights Film School]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160321022431/http://www.lightsfilmschool.com/blog/how-to-write-a-casting-call/481/|archivedate=March 21, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; not to be confused with [[script breakdown]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Script Breakdown 101|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMep2s_T89c|date=Feb 18, 2016|publisher=''[[YouTube]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161225024006/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMep2s_T89c|archivedate=December 25, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; are often provided by production agents who submit their clients to casting, which provides a brief summary of character (age, gender, race or ethnicity, situations they may be involved in). A more robust version of this painstaking task can be made through the Breakdown Services,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Breakdown Services|url=https://www.breakdownservices.com/|date=May 18, 2017|publisher=''[[Breakdown Services]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170517203341/http://www.breakdownservices.com/|archivedate=May 17, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was founded by former actor Gary Marsh&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Headshot Cafe interview with Gary Marsh (founder of Breakdown Services)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwqFMEPVTpk|date=Jul 8, 2013|publisher=''[[YouTube]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180510155907/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwqFMEPVTpk|archivedate=May 10, 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Breakdown Services|url=https://breakdownservices.com/index.cfm/main/about|date=May 18, 2017|publisher=''[[Breakdown Services]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170522044320/http://breakdownservices.com/index.cfm/main/about|archivedate=May 22, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; over 40 years ago. This was due to the difficult logistics issues for agents to get their actors submitted for acting roles from [[major film studio]]s and casting directors.

This casting breakdown service provides a complete character breakdown of various scripts and projects from production companies for film, television, [[print modeling|modeling]], commercials etc., to only agencies and managers who meet certain criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How can we contact casting directors or film directors in Hollywood as an aspiring actor?|url=https://www.quora.com/How-can-we-contact-casting-directors-or-film-directors-in-Hollywood-as-an-aspiring-actor/answer/Shaunti-Griffin?srid=hDjAD|date=May 12, 2017|publisher=''[[Quora]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These agents and managers are positioned all over the world, and subscribe to this service that literally has an entire suite of services for just about every aspect of the breakdown, for a monthly service subscription fee. This suite includes services such as Breakdown Express,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Breakdown Express|url=https://www.breakdownexpress.com/index.cfm|date=May 18, 2017|publisher=''[[Breakdown Express ]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170515155826/http://breakdownexpress.com/index.cfm|archivedate=May 15, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which offer representatives, casting and those who subscribe, a quicker way to post projects themselves. Another more limited version of the breakdown service, also for a monthly subscription fee is called Actors Access&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Actors Access|url=http://www.actorsaccess.com/|date=May 18, 2017|publisher=''[[Actors Access]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170520075705/http://www.actorsaccess.com/|archivedate=May 20, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where acting can subscribe to what is only made available to them, more like an entry level acting position, like [[under-five]], or a [[bit part]], a great tool for the actor whom is without an agent or manager.

An actor may go through several casting calls before receiving a part, and even though well known actors or actresses oftentimes still go through this very necessary process, some are privileged enough to have well known [[writer]]s, [[screenwriter]]s and or directors /producers [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitch]] a project for their intent to be cast in a role. The well known actor or actress oftentimes negotiates producer [[Credit (creative arts)|credit]] as well as very lucrative monetary compensation.

Independent casting studios like Film Independent who hosts the annual [[Independent Spirit Awards]] and the [[Los Angeles Film Festival]] are often utilized for casting calls so that auditions can take place in one location, as well as possible affiliated various locations saving valuable time, energy and money. 

===What Casting Directors Actually Do===

For some major productions, the process of selecting actors for sometimes hundreds of speaking parts and roles, may often require a specialized staff. While the last word remains with the people in charge such as the director, producer, artistic departments and overall production team, a '''casting director'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Twinkie Byrd - Casting in the 21st Century|url=https://socialbilitty.com/2017/03/twinkie-byrd-casting-in-the-21st-century/|date=March 24, 2017|publisher=''[[Socialbilitty]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171214074029/https://socialbilitty.com/2017/03/twinkie-byrd-casting-in-the-21st-century/|archivedate=December 14, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "CD" (and sometimes the casting associate) is in charge of most of the daily work involved in this process during [[pre-production]]. A casting director is sometimes assisted by a casting associate; productions with large numbers of extras may have their own extras casting director as well, however in all aspects of a film or television production's budget, they are all a part of the [[Above-the-line (filmmaking)|above-the-line]], answering to the director as part of his or her staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Job Descriptions for Film, Video &amp; Cgi|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Job_Descriptions_for_Film_Video_Cgi.html?id=gv8MAAAACAAJ&amp;hl=en|date=May 21, 2017|publisher=''[[Google Books]]''|access-date=May 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "CD" remains as a liaison between director, actors and their agents/managers and the studio/network to get the [[character (arts)|character]]s in the script cast. Some casting directors build an impressive career working on numerous [[Hollywood]] productions such as [[Marion Dougherty]], [[Mary Jo Slater]], [[Mary Selway]], [[Lynn Stalmaster]], [[April Webster]], [[Tammara Billik]], [[Marci Liroff]], [[Avy Kaufman]], [[Mindy Marin]], and [[Robi Reed]].

At least in the early stages of casting and or extras casting such as with casting agency [[Central Casting]], the process may be decentralized geographically, often in conjunction with actual shooting planned in different locations. Another reason may be tapping into each home market in the case of an [[international co-production]]. However, for the top parts, the choice of one or more beautiful people, whose presence is of enormous commercial importance, may rather follow strictly personal channels, e.g. direct contact with the director. During this time known as the "attachment phase" of a film, the casting director's job is to send out copies of the current script to agents for what is known as coverage. Coverage is when a script yet to be cast is read, summarized into a one-pager, and a brief set of character descriptions established. At this time, if an agency agrees to give coverage to a film, they will submit a list of ideas to the casting directors of actors available, capable, and in the price range of the film. Also, casting directors create their own&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/182731144|title=Self-management for actors : getting down to (show) business|last=Bonnie.|first=Gillespie,|date=2009|publisher=Cricket Feet Pub|isbn=9780972301992|edition=3rd |location=Los Angeles, CA|oclc=182731144}}&lt;/ref&gt; idea lists and can "check avails" or call the actor representation to see if they are available and interested in taking on potential projects. If an idea that is generated from a casting director and a subsequent avail check or from an agent's recommendation is "approved" by the director, producers, and financiers (or studio), the casting director sends out what is called an "Offer." The offer, usually contains a letter to the actor's representative explaining the role in question, a copy of the script, why the actor has been selected, the length of time commitment, the approximate start date of filming, the filming location, and the proposed salary offering. If the actor does not respond to the material or for whatever reason cannot accept the job, they respond to casting with what is called a "pass." If they accept the offer, the agent engages the casting director and a deal memo is sent from casting to the representative. It is at this time when negotiations between agency and production happen to finalize any deal points before the entertainment lawyers step in and draw up the attachment contracts. If this process happens very early on in the development of a movie but the official shoot dates and details are not yet known, a Letter of Intent or "LOI" is drafted, to indicate, if and when the project is "green lit" or begins active production, the actor is already hired to portray that particular role. 

After the attachment phase is complete (which depends on many factors -- including but not limited to: financial backers, studio heads, availability of other above the line personnel), the physical auditions begin for all of the remaining roles. During this time, depending on the budget of the film, they could have what is called "pre-screens" where you audition only for a casting director (or associate) to see if the actor is right for the material. After pre-screens would be a "director session", during this time the actor comes in and auditions (usually with the same material) and now performs for the casting director and the film director. If there is a next step, it is usually a "callback" or producer session, where anyone who has decision making power is in the room for your audition. In television, this phase is referred to as a "screen test" and Network Executives would also be in attendance.  Once actors are selected from the pool of available actors, the same booking process that happens in the attachment phase takes place for any actor except extras.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

The resulting list of actors who were selected to play a [[Character (arts)|character]] for a production, is called a [[cast list]], which is incorporated into a [[production company]]'s [[daily call sheet]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the Call Sheet on a film production?|url=https://www.pinterest.com/pin/AdHVgcm6ShVa0O6QBzSKUyej3F9s9hbwxymib5y-vI4CPDpfvYfevQI/|date=September 8, 2016|publisher=''[[Pinterest]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reflected in the projects [[title sequence]] especially with film and television.

=== Casting Office Personnel ===
'''Readers:''' This person reads all other character's lines opposite the actor who is currently auditioning. A good reader is someone who has acting skills, but who has no interest in booking a role through that casting director's office at that time. A reader will know how to give and take and play with other actors without ever outshining the auditioning actors.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; 

'''Interns:''' Interns are more common to commercial casting offices which host as many as a dozen different casting directors holding different auditions per day. While some commercial casting offices hold permanent casting space, many rent out studios on a project to project basis. A key intern will work with many busy casting directors sorting mail, copying sides and transcribing them onto "cue cards" or large boards to be read off of as prompts in the casting room, help actors sign in, and keep the flow of actors going in and out of the casting room as smooth as possible.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

'''Casting Assistants:''' This is the entry level position in the field of casting. These people go above and beyond the call of duty of your typical office assistant. They do everything from covering phones, to making copies, setting up audition (aka "session") equipment like lights, the camera, sound equipment, etc. They sometimes can be found in the office relaying audition appointments, checking actors avails, or in the casting room making sure the recording software is running smoothly so the Casting Director can focus on each actor's performance.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

'''Casting Associates:''' Associates is the second [[command hierarchy|chain of command]] in a casting office. Once a casting associate has worked for two years in the field of casting, they can apply for membership in [[Casting Society of America]]. Typically, the work under a Casting Director running pre-read sessions, prepping deal memos, and doing any calls to agents. Many associates begin to take on smaller scale projects so they can amass enough credits to move up in rank in CSA to a full-fledged Casting Director.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Casting Director:''' Their job is to know a lot about a lot of actors, so that they can advise and present to the director the best of the existing possibilities. Casting directors are highly influential and is usually on the project because the director trusts their judgements. They are also the ones who decides who the director does see. Good casting directors "discover" actor by carefully setting it up so that the director and producer will feel as if they've made the discovery of the new young actor. On the occasion when the director or producer does not respond to the actor presented, they must keep in mind that they aren't directing the production, the director is the one who's going to have to work with that actor-- therefore, it is casting's responsibility to delicately balance between showcasing the actor available to them and the director and producer's sensibilities, tastes, and expectations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/47813908|title=Audition : everything an actor needs to know to get the part|last=Michael.|first=Shurtleff,|date=1980|orig-year=1978|publisher=Bantam Books|isbn=0553272950|edition=Bantam |location=New York|oclc=47813908}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Casting Society of America]] (CSA)===
The significant organization of professional screen, television, reality, and theater casting in the US is the [[Casting Society of America]] (CSA), but membership is optional.  Casting directors organized in 2005 and became members of a collective bargaining unit, the [https://www.ht399.org/ Hollywood Teamsters Local 399] and [https://teamster.org/locals/local-817 New York Teamsters Local 817].

=== [[Artios Awards]] ===
The highest honor a casting director can receive is awarded by their peers in the [[Casting Society of America]]. ''Artios'', comes from the Greek word meaning, "perfectly fitted." The Artios award excellence in casting for all genres of casting except commercials. The Artios are currently held mid-January annually with ceremonies in New York, Los Angeles, and (beginning in 2018) London. Since their incarnation in 1985, they were held in November but were moved in 2013-2014 season to align with the rest of the film and television industry's awards season. The Artios is awarded to those CSA members who receive primary screen (or program) credit for casting on the winning project. Location Casting Directors, Casting Executives and Department Heads who are CSA members and who receive credit on winning projects also receive an Artios Award. CSA Associates on those projects are recognized in the press and with a certificate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.castingsociety.com/awards/artios|title=Artios Awards|website=www.castingsociety.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-12|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102213058/http://www.castingsociety.com/awards/artios|archivedate=2013-11-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Emmy Awards ===
The [[Emmy Awards]] has a category for casting directors. As of 2017, Junie Lowry-Johnson has won the most casting Emmys as an individual, all in the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Casting for a Drama Series|drama category]]. She has six awards for her work on ''[[NYPD Blue]]'', ''[[Six Feet Under (TV series)|Six Feet Under]]'', ''[[True Blood]]'' and ''[[Homeland (TV series)|Homeland]]''. The only shows to win casting Emmys three times were ''[[30 Rock]]'' and ''[[Veep]]'', both in the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Casting for a Comedy Series|comedy category]]. In 2017, at the [[69th Primetime Emmy Awards]], the [[Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences]] introduced the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Casting for a Reality Program]].

'''Chesu 车苏''' is a [[Loloish languages|Loloish]] language spoken in southern [[Shuangbai County]], northern [[Xinping Yi and Dai Autonomous County|Xinping County]], and [[Eshan County]] in [[Yunnan]], China.

The Chesu refer to themselves as ''tsu su˧pa˨˩''&lt;ref name="Yunnan1955"/&gt; or ''tɕi˨˩su˥pʰo˨˩'' (Jishupo 吉输颇).&lt;ref name="Long2007"&gt;Long Luogui 龙倮贵. 2007. ''Honghe yizu zuyuan zucheng ji qi renkou fenbu'' [http://www.yixueyanjiu.com/news/3/z_3_4338.html 红河彝族族源族称及其人口分布].&lt;/ref&gt; Yunnan (1955) reports that Chesu is spoken mostly in Taihe Township 太和乡, with a population of over 360 as of 1955.&lt;ref name="Yunnan1955"&gt;[http://www.doc88.com/p-97281176367.html 云南民族识别参考资料] (1955), p.40&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ethnologue'' reports 3,300 Chesu speakers out of an ethnic population of 6,600 people, as of 2007.

Bradley (2007) reports that Chesu is closely related to [[Nasu language|Nasu]] and classifies it as a ''Nasoid'' language. Chesu speakers consider themselves to be a separate ethnic group from the surrounding [[Nisu language|Nisu]] speakers. The Chesu language is currently being replaced by [[Nisu language|Nisu]] and Chinese.&lt;ref name="Bradley2007"&gt;Bradley, David. 2007. East and Southeast Asia. In Moseley, Christopher (ed.), Encyclopedia of the World's Endangered Languages, 349-424. London &amp; New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Chesu is also used as a second language by [[Shansu language|Hlersu]] speakers (''Ethnologue'').

A '''dolphin''' is a man-made marine structure that extends above the water level and is not connected to shore.

Dolphins are usually installed to provide a fixed structure when it would be impractical to extend the shore to provide a dry-access facility, for example, when the number of ships is greater than can be accommodated by the length of the [[berth (moorings)|berth/pier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tsinker|first=Gregory P.|title=Port engineering: planning, construction, maintenance, and security  |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|pages=474|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kXaAKdwyJzYC&amp;pg=PA474&amp;lpg=PA474&amp;dq=%22mooring+dolphins+are%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6B3v0mxPuc&amp;sig=pIAqyCeUlpoSfKNbYPKzrl2yvNY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=0Eb0TLW_N5P0swOiyvSfDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22mooring%20dolphins%20are%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical uses include extending a berth (a berthing dolphin) or providing a [[mooring (watercraft)|mooring ]]point (a mooring dolphin). Dolphins are also used to house navigation aids such as lights or [[daybeacon]]s, and display regulatory information such as speed limits and other safety information, or advertising. 

They are also used to protect structures from possible impact by ships, in a similar fashion to [[fender (boating)|boating fenders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Robert Cabral, Plaintiff-appellant, v. Healy Tibbits Builders, Inc., Defendant-appellee United States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit. - 128 F.3d 1289|url=http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/128/1289/525073/|accessdate=30 November 2010|date=Amended 15 October 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; A notable example of dolphins used to protect a bridge is the [[Sunshine Skyway Bridge]] across the mouth of [[Tampa Bay]]. In 1980, a freighter hit a pier on one of the bridge's two, two-lane spans causing a {{convert|1200|ft|adj=on}} section of the bridge to fall into the water, resulting in 35 deaths. When a replacement span was designed, a top priority was to prevent ships from colliding with the new bridge.&lt;ref name=Scherberger/&gt; The new bridge is protected by 36 dolphins: four large dolphins protecting the two main pylons supporting the cable-stayed main span plus 32 smaller dolphins protecting bridge piers for 1/4&amp;nbsp;mi (1/2&amp;nbsp;km) to either side of the main span.&lt;ref name=Scherberger&gt;{{cite news|last1=Scherberger|first1=Tom|title=The Lesson - A Bridge On Guard Span's Protective Shield Called Best In The World|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1987-03-22/news/0120010006_1_bridge-was-completed-skyway-piers|accessdate=29 April 2018|work=[[The Orlando Sentinel]]|date=March 22, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of the dolphins was $41&amp;nbsp;million (approximately $90&amp;nbsp;million in 2017 dollars).&lt;ref name=Scherberger/&gt;

Dolphins typically consist of a number of [[deep foundation|piles]] driven into the seabed or riverbed, and connected above the water level to provide a platform or fixing point. The piles can be untreated [[Lophira alata|azobé]] wood, pressure treated pine wood poles, or [[steel]] or [[reinforced concrete]] beams, blocks or tubes. Smaller dolphins can have the piles drawn together with wire rope, but larger dolphins are typically fixed using a [[reinforced concrete]] capping or a structural steel frame.

Access to a dolphin may be via a pedestrian bridge in the case of mooring dolphins, but is usually by boat.

'''Embaloh''' (Maloh) is an [[Austronesian]] ([[Dayak languages|Dayak]]) language of Borneo. Apart from [[Taman language|Taman]], it is not close to other languages, and its classification has long been controversial. Adelaar and Himmelmann (2005) propose that it is especially close to [[Buginese language|Buginese]]. However, it is frequently left as an isolate within [[Nuclear Malayo-Polynesian languages|(Nuclear) Malayo-Polynesian]].

Kalis (Kalis Maloh) may be a distinct language.

'''Fanagalo''' is a [[pidgin]] (simplified language) based primarily on [[Zulu language|Zulu]], with English and a small [[Afrikaans]] input. It is used as a [[lingua franca]], mainly in the gold, diamond, coal and copper mining industries in South Africa and to a lesser extent in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Namibia]], [[Zambia]], and [[Zimbabwe]]. Although it is used as a second language only, the number of speakers was estimated as "several hundred thousand" in 1975.   Once the British left, English became the lingua franca enabling different tribes in the same country to communicate with each other, and Fanagalo use declined.

Fanagalo is the only [[Zulu language|Zulu]]-based pidgin language, and is a rare example of a pidgin based on an indigenous language rather than on the language of a colonising or trading power.

The variety in [[Zimbabwe]] ([[Rhodesia]]) is known as '''Chilapalapa''' and is influenced by [[Shona language|Shona]], while the variety in [[Zambia]] ([[Northern Rhodesia]]), called '''Cikabanga'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greatnorthroad.org/boma/Image:Chikabanga_p01.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; (pronounced, and sometimes spelt, Chikabanga), is influenced by [[Bemba language|Bemba]].

==Etymology==
The name "Fanagalo" comes from strung-together [[Nguni languages|Nguni]] forms fana-ga-lo meaning "like + of + that" and has the meaning "do it like this", reflecting its use as a language of instruction.

Other spellings of the name are ''Fanakalo'' and ''Fanekolo''. It is also known as ''Isikula, Lololo'' or ''Isilololo, Piki'' or ''Isipiki'', and ''Silunguboi''. 

In the Nguni tongues, the [[prefix]] ''Mu-'' or ''Ma-'' implies the singular, while ''Bu-'' or ''Ba-'' signifies the plural – hence ''Muntu'' = a man; ''Bantu'' = men, particularly when applied to tribes, e.g. ''Ma-tabele''.  Similarly, the prefix ''Chi-'' or ''Si-'' indicates the language spoke by that tribe.  e.g. men of the ''Lozi'' tribe are called ''Ba-rotse'', and they speak ''Si-lozi''; Bembas speak Chiwemba; Tswanas live in Botswana, or as it used to be called, Bechuanaland.

Chi-lapa-lapa thus is the "language" derived from ''lapa'' = "there", with repetition for emphasis.

==History and usage==
Fanagalo is one of a number of [[African languages|African]] [[pidgin]] languages that developed during the colonial period to promote ease of communication. {{Harvcoltxt|Adendorff|2002}} suggests that it developed in the nineteenth century in [[KwaZulu-Natal Province]] as a way for English colonists to communicate with their servants and was also used as a lingua franca between English and Dutch/Afrikaans speaking colonists.

Fanagalo was used extensively in gold and diamond mines because the South African mining industry employed workers on fixed contracts from across southern and central Africa: including [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Zambia]], [[Botswana]], [[Malawi]] and [[Mozambique]]. With workers originating from a range of countries and having a vast range of different mother tongues, Fanagalo provided a simple way to communicate and is still used as a training and operating medium.  Fifteen hours instruction was considered sufficient for an initiate to become reasonably fluent.  See [[Witwatersrand Native Labour Association]].

Adendorff describes two variants of the language, '''Mine Fanagalo''' and '''Garden Fanagalo'''. The latter name refers to its use with servants in households. It was previously known as '''Kitchen Kaffir'''. (The term "[[kaffir (racial term)|kaffir]]" tended, in Southern Africa, to be used as a derogatory term for black people, and is now considered extremely offensive. It is derived from the Arab word Kafir, meaning unbeliever.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.arabic-for-nerds.com/2017/02/11/what-is-a-kafir/&lt;/ref&gt;)

In the mid-20th century in South Africa there were Government efforts to promote and standardise Fanagalo as a universal second language, under the name of "Basic Bantu".

In contrast, mining companies in the early 21st century have attempted to phase out Fanagalo in favour of the pre-existing, local languages. Ravyse (2018) discusses Fanagalo's apparent resistance to opposing official policy, in spite of its ongoing stigma as a language for the illiterate. Fanagalo has become intertwined with the culture of the mining industry, and its continuation seems to hinge on the ongoing favour of its speaking community, rather than industry policy. 

Mining aside, Adendorff also suggests that Fanagalo has unfavourable and negative connotations for many South Africans. However, he raises the point that Fanagalo is sometimes used between white South Africans, particularly expatriates, as a signal of South African origin and a way of conveying solidarity in an informal manner. That role has of late largely been taken over by Afrikaans; even among English speaking South African expatriates.

In the latter half of the 20th century, holiday makers from the Rhodesias often used to go on holiday to Lourenço Marques in Mozambique (now Maputo), where many people speak Portuguese – but most also spoke a form of Fanagalo.

All three languages are currently experiencing a revival in their popularity as a lingua franca, now freed from connotations of "colonialism" and valued for their intrinsic usefulness.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.grocotts.co.za/node/27774&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rhodesia]]n comedian [[Wrex Tarr]] was famous for routines that make extensive use of Chilapalapa.

==Language features and variants==
Mine Fanagalo in South Africa and Zimbabwe is based mostly on [[Zulu language|Zulu]] vocabulary (about 70%), with English (about 25%) and some words from Afrikaans (5%). It does not have the range of Zulu inflections, and it tends to follow English word order. 

Adendorff describes Mine Fanagalo and Garden Fanagalo as being basically the same pidgin. He suggests that Garden Fanagalo should be seen as lying towards the English end of a continuum, and Mine Fanagalo closer to the Zulu end.

Several key features differentiate Fanagalo from the Nguni languages (such as Zulu and Xhosa). ''Lo'' functions as both an article and a demonstrative, while only a demonstrative in Zulu. ''Lapha'' is used to mean "here", also meaning "there" when the first syllable is stressed, and is also used as a general preposition for location. (It works for anything such as "on", or "near", etc.) Zulu, on the other hand, only uses ''lapha''to mean "here". Additionally, Fanagalo only uses free pronouns: ''mina'', ''tina'', ''wena'', ''ena'', meaning "I, we, you, he/she/it/they". Zulu only uses pronouns for emphasis, relying instead on verb agreement markers, much like Spanish. 

The past tense of verbs is marked by the suffix ''-ile'' (''hamba "I go, go!", ''hambile'' "I went"), and the future with the modal ''azi'' (''azi hamba'' "will go").''

Here are two examples (all letters are pronounced):-

''Koki Lobin''&lt;br /&gt;
Cock Robin

''Zonke nyoni lapa moyo ena kala, ena kala''&lt;br /&gt;
All birds of air, they cried, they cried&lt;br /&gt;
''Ena izwile ena file lo nyoni Koki Lobin''&lt;br /&gt;
They heard the death the bird Cock Robin&lt;br /&gt;
''Ena izwile, ena file, ena izwile ena file Cocky Lobin.''

''Kubani ena bulalile Koki Lobin?''&lt;br /&gt;
Who they killed Cock Robin&lt;br /&gt;
''Mina kruma lo Sparrow''&lt;br /&gt;
Me, said the sparrow&lt;br /&gt;
''Na lo picannin bow and arrow kamina''&lt;br /&gt;
With the little bow &amp; arrow of mine&lt;br /&gt;
''Mina bulalile Koki Lobin.''&lt;br /&gt;
I killed Cock Robin

''TANDAZO''&lt;br /&gt;
(The Lord's Prayer)

''Baba ga tina, Wena kona pezulu,''&lt;br /&gt;
Father of ours, You are above&lt;br /&gt;
'' Tina bonga lo Gama ga wena; ''&lt;br /&gt;
We thank (for) the name of you&lt;br /&gt;
''Tina vuma lo mteto ga wena Lapa mhlaba, fana na pezulu.''&lt;br /&gt;
''Niga tina namuhla lo zinkwa yena izwasisa;''&lt;br /&gt;
Give us today etc., etc...  &lt;br /&gt;
''Futi, yekelela masono gatina,''&lt;br /&gt;
''Loskati tina yekelela masono ga lomunye.''&lt;br /&gt;
''Hayi letisa tina lapa lo cala; Kodwa, sindisa tina ku lo bubi,''&lt;br /&gt;
''Ndaba Wena kona lo-mteto, lo mandla, na lo dumela, Zonkeskat. Amen.''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3350">In [[phonology]] and [[historical linguistics]], '''feeding order''' is a situation in which rule A creates new contexts in which rule B can apply; it would not have been possible for rule B to apply otherwise. 

If there are two rules, rule A which looks like ''x → y'' and rule B which looks like ''y → z'', then the following is a feeding order:
# A: ''x→y''
# B: ''y→z''

The opposite of feeding order, the situation in which rule A destroys a certain context so rule B can no longer apply, is called ''[[bleeding order]]''.

==Examples==

A good example of feeding order can be seen in [[English language|English]], where [[preglottalization]] can be considered as rule B. As a consequence of this rule, all [[voiceless]] [[plosive]]s which make part of a word-final [[consonant cluster]] are glottalized. This can be seen in the form ''looked'', with the [[underlying representation]] {{IPA|/lʊkt/}}. It is pronounced {{IPA|[lʊʔkt]}}. Another rule in English which is called [[fortis stop insertion]] shall be considered here as rule A. This rule inserts a voiceless plosive for example in {{IPA|/prɪns/}} (''prince''), so that the new form of the word becomes {{IPA|[prɪnts]}}. Because a new phonological context has been created in which rule B can take place, the final output form of ''prince'' is {{IPA|[prɪnʔts]}}.    

==Counterfeeding order==
If the order of rules which are in feeding order is reversed, this is said to be a '''counterfeeding order'''. 

If we have two rules, rule A which looks like ''x → y'' and rule B which looks like ''y → z'' the following is a counterfeeding order:
# B: ''y→z''
# A: ''x→y''

An example of this can be seen in [[French language|French]], where ''petite nièce'' ("little niece") is pronounced {{IPA|[pətit njɛs]}}. If the rule which [[deletion (phonology)|deletes]] word-final {{IPA|/-ə/}} in French had been applied before another rule which deletes word-final consonants before another consonant, this would have been an example of feeding order and the "final output" form ([[Transformational grammar|surface form]]) would have been {{IPA|[pəti njɛs]}} instead. 

A counter-feeding order very often creates [[phonological opacity]]. In the given case, it is the application of the rule deleting word-final consonants which has thus become opaque in French.

In [[historical linguistics]], a sequence of rules in counterfeeding order is called a [[chain shift]].  A chain shift can be presented graphically like the following:
* ''a→b→c→d''
where only one rule can apply.  The result is that what was originally ''a'' becomes ''b'', what was originally ''b'' becomes ''c'', what was originally ''c'' becomes ''d'', etc.  In essence, each sound "shifts" one position to the right.  A good example of such a chain shift occurred as part of the [[Great Vowel Shift]], which took place historically in English around 1500 AD.  The long front vowels were raised one position, while the original high front vowel became a [[diphthong]]:
* {{IPA|/aː/→/ɛː/→/eː/→/iː/→/əi/}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8269">'''Ferdinand Ebner''' (January 31, 1882 in [[Wiener Neustadt]] – October 17, 1931 in [[Gablitz]], [[First Austrian Republic|Austria]]), was an [[Austrians|Austrian]] elementary [[school teacher]] and [[philosopher]].&lt;ref name="Ebner"&gt;{{BBKL|e/ebner_f|band=15|autor=Martin Weiß|spalten=496-507}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with [[Martin Buber]] and [[Franz Rosenzweig]], he is considered one of the most outstanding representatives of dialogical thinking. Ebner's philosophy is about man existing in a I-Thou personal relationship with God and with others. His thought has similarities with the [[Christian existentialism]] of [[Gabriel Marcel]]. On the basis of the unity of I and Thou, which has in language (in the spoken word), and in love its expressions, Ebner developed a religiously informed philosophy of language which led to his practical-ethical understanding of the Christian faith as the basis for the personal fulfillment and the whole social progress.

==Life and Oeuvre==

In 1897, after finishing school, Ebner entered the Teachers' Training College in Wiener Neustadt. In 1900 a lung disease obliged him to interrupt his courses. He had to spend four weeks in a health resort in [[Gleichenberg]] and then five months in a lung sanatorium in [[Alland]]. His sister Josephine had died of tuberculosis, just one year after her marriage. The young student felt ill and depressed. After one year interruption Ebner completed his study at the Teachers´ Training College in 1902 with best qualifications. After ten years in Waldegg, in 1912 his job took Ebner to [[Gablitz]] near [[Vienna]], from where he could again take refuge in the Viennese cultural scene. He spent whole days visiting Vienna's churches, museums, concert halls, theaters and coffee houses. There, he discussed with friends and acquaintances, and immersed himself for hours in "Die Fackel" and the "Brenner".

Ebner dealt all his life with philosophical and religious issues. He was a great reader: literature, philosophy, psychology. He read [[Otto Weininger]]'s ''Sex and Character'', later Pascal, [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], [[Søren Kierkegaard]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], to name a few. His first philosophical work ''Ethic and Life: fragments of a metaphysics of individual existence'' (1913-1914) remained unpublished until 2013. His major work is ''The Word and the spiritual Realities: Pneumatological Fragments''. It was published by Ludwig von Ficker´s Brenner-Verlag in 1921. He published a few more articles in Ficker´s Brenner Review. Ludwig von Ficker remained until Ebner´s death one of his best friends.

In 1923 Ebner became reluctantly the head of the school, but he had to retire soon due to further illnesses and depressions, which led him to two suicide attempts. After his stay at the sanatorium [[Burg Hartenstein]], he married his colleague Maria Mizera. They had a son, Walter Ebner. Ebner died of tuberculosis in Gablitz, where he is buried, in 1931. Before dying he had time to finish his important work ''Aphorismen 1931''.

Ebner's estate is located in the Brenner-Archiv in [[Innsbruck]].

Ebner´s work has had an important influence in many fields of the human knowledge and in the modern comprehension of the Christian faith. As Moltmann said in his ''Theology of Hope'', Ebner used Pascal´s and Kierkegaard´s thought to talk about "the breaking through of the eternity in the present" (''Schriften'' I, 259, 912). In so doing Ebner wanted to point out the importance of prayer and of man´s decision of religious faith. But Ebner did not stop there and went on to affirm the God of the resurrection of Jesus Christ (I,568; II, 625), the God of the "promised salvation", of the "divine promise" (I,432,447,610), of "the Kingdom of God" (I, 609), so that in our faith in Jesus Christ rests our Christian "legitimate hope in the future" (I,568). Jesus Christ is for Ebner, as the Gospel says, "the light of the world" (I,570) until the complete lightness when he returns, until "the Second Coming" (I,302-303). Man´s responsibility and task is "to help establish the Kingdom of God" (I,573: "die Herrschaft Gottes aufrichten zu helfen"). Ebner´s personalism and religious thought has influenced both the Protestant and the catholic world, from E. Brunner, D. Bonhöffer and Jürgen Moltmann to K. Rahner, H. Küng and J. Ratzinger.

During the tragic events of the first World War, Ebner tried to understand "the signs of the times" (''Mat'' 16,3) to grasp the meaning of human life and human history. "Dreaming about the spirit" as often men do was not the right answer. In the I-solitude (Icheinsamkeit)without a real relationship with God, our Thou, we dream of the spirit in the different cultural  expressions. But when the right I-Thou encounter takes place we do not separate theory and praxis anymore, because we are able to understand Matthew 25,40: "as you did this to one of the least of these brothers of mine, you did it to me". (I,268). Living in a real, true relationship with God and our neighbour means waking up to the "spiritual realities", the end of our just "dreaming of the spirit". So can men be creative and work for a better society without forgetting justice and solidarity, the brother in need.

{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2017}}
[[File:The Cherry Orchard MAT.jpg|thumb|300px|In [[Konstantin Stanislavski|Stanislavski]]'s [[List of productions directed by Konstantin Stanislavski|production]] of ''[[The Cherry Orchard]]'' ([[Moscow Art Theatre]], 1904), a three-dimensional [[Box set (theatre)|box set]] gives the illusion of a real room. The actors act as if unaware of the audience, separated by an invisible "fourth wall", defined by the [[Proscenium]] arch.]]
[[File:Chicago Auditorium Building, interior from balcony.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Proscenium]] arch of the theatre in the [[Auditorium Building (Chicago)|Auditorium Building, Chicago]]. It is the frame decorated with square tiles that forms the vertical rectangle separating the stage (''mostly behind the lowered curtain'') from the auditorium (''the area with seats'').]]

The '''fourth wall''' is a performance [[Dramatic convention|convention]] in which an invisible, imagined wall separates actors from the audience. While the audience can see through this "wall", the convention assumes, the actors act as if they cannot. From the 16th century onwards, the rise of illusionism in staging practices, which culminated in the [[Realism (theatre)|realism]] and [[Naturalism (theatre)|naturalism]] of the [[Nineteenth-century theatre|theatre of the 19th century]], led to the development of the fourth wall concept.&lt;ref name="Bell"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bell |first=Elizabeth S. |title=Theories of Performance |year=2008 |publisher=Sage |isbn=978-1-4129-2637-9 |page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wallis"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wallis |first=Mick |last2=Shepherd |first2=Simon |title=Studying plays |year=1998 |publisher=Arnold |isbn=0-340-73156-7 |page=214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[metaphor]] suggests a relationship to the [[mise-en-scène]] behind a [[Proscenium|proscenium arch]]. When a scene is set indoors and three of the walls of its room are presented onstage, in what is known as a [[Box set (theatre)|box set]], the "fourth" of them would run along the line (technically called the "[[proscenium]]") dividing the room from the [[auditorium]]. The "fourth wall", though, is a theatrical convention, rather than of [[set design]]. The actors ignore the audience, focus their attention exclusively on the dramatic world, and remain absorbed in its fiction, in a state that the [[theatre practitioner]] [[Konstantin Stanislavski]] called "public solitude"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gray |first=Paul |title=Stanislavski and America: a critical chronology |journal=Tulane Drama Review |volume=9 |issue=2 |year=1964 |pages=21–60 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (the ability to behave as one would in private, despite, in actuality, being watched intently while so doing, or to be 'alone in public'). In this way, the fourth wall exists regardless of the presence of any actual walls in the set, or the physical arrangement of the [[Theater (building)|theatre building]] or performance space, or the actors' distance from or proximity to the audience.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

"'''Breaking the fourth wall'''" is any instance in which this performance convention, having been adopted more generally in the drama, is violated. This can be done through either directly referencing the audience, the play as a play, or the characters' fictionality. The temporary suspension of the convention in this way draws attention to its use in the rest of the performance. This act of drawing attention to a play's performance conventions is [[Metatheatre|metatheatrical]]. A similar effect of [[metareference]] is achieved when the performance convention of avoiding direct contact with the camera, generally used by actors in a television drama or film, is temporarily suspended. The phrase "breaking the fourth wall" is used to describe such effects in those media. Breaking the fourth wall is also possible in other media, such as video games and books.

==History of the convention==
The concept is usually attributed to the philosopher, critic and dramatist [[Denis Diderot]].{{when|date=July 2018}}&lt;ref name=Cuddon-2012&gt;{{cite book|last=Cuddon|first=J. A.|title=Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Theory|year=2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-32600-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term itself was used by [[Molière]].{{when|date=July 2018}}&lt;ref name=Mangan-2013&gt;{{cite book|last=Mangan|first=Michael |title=The Drama, Theatre and Performance Companion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HekcBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA172|year=2013|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-137-01552-5|page=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Stage Layout Plan.jpg|thumb|right|Typical stage, fourth wall being the house.]] 
The presence of the fourth wall is an established convention of modern [[Realism (theatre)|realistic theatre]], which has led some artists to draw direct attention to it for dramatic or comic effect when a boundary is "broken", when an actor or character addresses the audience directly.&lt;ref name="Bell" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Abelman"&gt;{{cite book |last=Abelman |first=Robert |title=Reaching a critical mass: a critical analysis of television entertainment |year=1998 |publisher=L. Erlbaum Associates |isbn=0-8058-2199-6 |pages=8–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Breaking the fourth wall is common in [[pantomime]] and children's theatre where, for example, a character might ask the children for help, as when [[Peter Pan]] appeals to the audience to applaud in an effort to revive the fading [[Tinker Bell]] ("If you believe in fairies, clap your hands!"). Many Shakespearian plays use this technique for comic effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Study Guide: The Complete Works of  William Shakespeare (Abridged) |url=http://www.qpac.com.au/resources/images/Works_Shakespeare_13_Study_Guide_2013.pdf |accessdate=August 3, 2017 | page = 10 | quote = When the fourth wall is kicked down, as it is in this show, we have to expect that sometimes the unexpected will occur. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The acceptance of the transparency of the fourth wall is part of the [[suspension of disbelief]] between a work of fiction and an audience, allowing them to enjoy the fiction as though they were observing real events.&lt;ref name="Wallis" /&gt; Critic [[Vincent Canby]] described it in 1987 as "that invisible scrim that forever separates the audience from the stage".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/28/movies/film-view-sex-can-spoil-the-scene.html |title=Film view: sex can spoil the scene |last=Canby |first=Vincent |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=28 June 1987 |page=A.17 |accessdate=3 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In cinema===
The earliest recorded breaking of the fourth wall in serious cinema was in [[Mary MacLane]]'s revolutionary 1918 silent film ''[[Men Who Have Made Love to Me]]'', in which the enigmatic authoress - who portrays herself - interrupts the vignettes onscreen to address the audience directly.&lt;ref&gt;https://wfpp.cdrs.columbia.edu/pioneer/ccp-mary-maclane/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Oliver Hardy]] was one of the first notable examples of breaking the fourth wall in his movies with [[Stan Laurel]], when he would often stare directly at the camera to seek sympathy from viewers. [[Groucho Marx]] spoke directly to the audience in ''Animal Crackers'' (1930), and ''[[Horse Feathers]]'' (1932), in the later film advising them to "go out to the lobby" during [[Chico Marx]]'s piano interlude. Comedy films by [[Mel Brooks]], [[Monty Python]], and [[Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker]] frequently broke the fourth wall in some, such that with these films, "the fourth wall is so flimsy and so frequently shattered that it might as well not exist", according to ''[[The A.V. Club]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.avclub.com/article/supercut-breaks-cinemas-fabled-fourth-wall-literal-233065 | title = This supercut breaks cinema's fabled fourth wall hundreds of times | first = Joe | last = Blevins | date = 1 March 2016 | accessdate = 19 August 2016 | work = [[The A.V. Club]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Breaking the fourth wall is an integral part of the ending of [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]]'s 1973 film ''[[The Holy Mountain (1973 film)|The Holy Mountain]]''. In the Mel Brooks film ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'' (1974), the characters literally break the fourth wall. [[Woody Allen]] broke the fourth wall several times in his movie ''[[Annie Hall]]'' (1977), as he explained, "because I felt many of the people in the audience had the same feelings and the same problems. I wanted to talk to them directly and confront them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Björkman|first=Stig |authorlink=Stig Björkman|title=Woody Allen on Woody Allen  |year=1995 |origyear=1993|publisher=Faber and Faber|location=London |isbn=0-571-17335-7 |page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 1985 film [[The Purple Rose of Cairo]] features the breaking of the fourth wall as a central plot point. The [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] movie ''[[Ferris Bueller's Day Off]]'' (1986), is another well-known fourth-wall-breaking movie. Bueller, played by [[Matthew Broderick]], often turns to the camera and breaks character to tell his thought process or explain his reasoning. Another Chicago area fourth-wall-breaking film, [[High Fidelity (film)|''High Fidelity'']], has [[John Cusack]]'s character Rob intimately sharing his life struggles and confessions with the audience. Two more recent examples are the 2016 film ''[[Deadpool (film)|Deadpool]]'', in which it is used as a comic device between the main character and the audience and the 2017 film ''[[I, Tonya]]'', where Tonya Harding and the other characters tell a first person story of Tonya's life as a black comedy.

[[Jerry Lewis]] wrote in his 1971 book ''The Total Filmmaker'', “Some film-makers believe you should never have an actor look directly into the camera. They maintain it makes the audience uneasy, and interrupts the screen story.  I think that is nonsense, and usually I have my actors, in a single, look direct into the camera at least once in a film, if a point is to be served.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Total Filmmaker|first=Jerry|last=Lewis|year=1971|publisher=Random House|isbn=9780446669269|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin and Lewis]] look directly at the audience in ''You’re Never Too Young'' (1955), and Lewis and co-star [[Stella Stevens]] each look directly into the camera several times in ''[[The Nutty Professor]]'' (1963), and Lewis’ character holds a pantomime conversation with the audience in ''[[The Disorderly Orderly]]'' (1964). The final scene of ''[[The Patsy (1964 film)|The Patsy]]'' (1964) is famous for revealing to the audience the movie as a movie, and Lewis as actor/director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://youtube.com/watch?v=7njkDCAlFTQ|title=The Patsy Movie Ending|first=|last=|publisher=dino4ever|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brightlightsfilm.com/jerry-lewis-b-joseph-levitch-newark-new-jersey-1926-res-hollywood/|first=Michael|last=Stern|date=August 21, 2017|title=Jerry Lewis: b. Joseph Levitch, Newark New Jersey, res. Hollywood|publisher=brightlightsfilm.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===On television===
{{Example farm|date=November 2018}}
On television, breaking the fourth wall has been done throughout the history of the medium. [[George Burns]] did it numerous times on ''[[The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show]]'', where he starred in with his real-life wife [[Gracie Allen]] from 1950 to 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/the-george-burns-and-gracie-allen-show/cast/200294 |title=The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show Cast |publisher=TVGuide.com |date= |accessdate=2015-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dean Martin]] and Jerry Lewis routinely broke the fourth wall in their 1950 to 1955 ''[[Colgate Comedy Hour]]'' sketches. ''[[It's Garry Shandling's Show]]'' and ''[[Mrs. Brown's Boys]]'' both have their title character walking between sets mid-scene, and the latter occasionally shows characters retaking fluffed lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dessau|first=Bruce|title=Mrs Brown's Boys: mainstream comedy for the middle-aged|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2011/mar/01/mrs-browns-boys|newspaper=The Guardian|date=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:breakingthewall.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hugh Laurie]] (right) breaking the fourth wall and addressing the TV viewers during a sketch with [[Stephen Fry]]]]Another television character who regularly breaks the fourth wall is [[Francis Urquhart]] in the British TV drama series ''[[House of Cards (UK TV series)|House of Cards]]'', ''[[To Play the King]]'' and ''[[The Final Cut (TV serial)|The Final Cut]]''. Urquhart addresses the audience several times during each episode, giving the viewer comments on his own actions on the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cartmell|first=Deborah|title=The Cambridge Companion to Literature on Screen|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521614864|page=244}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same technique is also used, though less frequently, in the American adaptation of ''[[House of Cards (U.S. TV series)|House of Cards]]'' by main character [[Frank Underwood (House of Cards)|Frank Underwood]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Macaulay |first=Scott |url=http://filmmakermagazine.com/69368-breaking-the-fourth-wall-supercut/ |title=Breaking the Fourth Wall Supercut |publisher=[[Filmmaker (magazine)|Filmmaker]] |date=24 April 2013 |accessdate=5 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by his wife [[Claire Underwood|Claire]].

The main character in ''[[Clarissa Explains It All]]'' addresses the audience at least once each episode.

[[Zack Morris]] frequently addresses the audience at the beginning and end of nearly every episode of ''[[Saved by the Bell]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fame10.com/entertainment/10-things-we-miss-the-most-about-saved-by-the-bell/&lt;/ref&gt;

Dobie Gillis, near a statue of [[The Thinker]] addresses the audience at the beginning and end of [[The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis]].

During the 12th season of ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'', [[Sue Ellen Ewing]] collaborates with a screenplay writer to retell the events that occurred in earlier episodes of the series.

In the "War and Peace" episode of the second season of ''[[Northern Exposure]]'', [[Joel Fleischman]] defuses a crisis by announcing that the viewers would not accept either of the two possible outcomes of a particular scene in which a duel is about to take place, and the other characters agree to move on to the episode's next scene.

On the 1977-1984 sitcom, ''[[Three's Company]]'', and later on the 1979-1980 sitcom, ''[[The Ropers]]'', the husband character Stanley Roper (played by [[Norman Fell]]) would frequently break the fourth wall in a subtle manner, by turning to look at the camera while laughing after ridiculing his wife Helen, played by [[Audra Lindley]]. A similar technique was often used in British television series ''[[Hustle (TV series)|Hustle]]'', with characters winking or smiling knowingly at the camera at key points in the action.

The 2001–2006 Fox sitcom ''[[The Bernie Mac Show]]'' had the lead character Bernie Mac breaking the fourth wall talking to "America".
The convention of breaking the fourth wall is often seen on [[mockumentary]] sitcoms, including ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]''.  Mockumentary shows which break the fourth wall poke fun at the documentary genre with the intention of increasing the satiric tone of the show. Characters in ''The Office'' directly speak to the audience during interview sequences. Characters are removed from the rest of the group to speak and reflect on their experiences. When this occurs, the rules of an impersonal documentary are shattered. The person behind the camera, the interviewer, is also referenced when the characters gaze and speak straight to the camera. The interviewer, however, is only indirectly spoken to and remains hidden. This technique, when used in shows with complex genres, serves to heighten the comic tone of the show while also proving that the camera itself is far from a passive onlooker.&lt;ref&gt;Savorelli, Antonio. Beyond Sitcom: New Directions in American Television Comedy. North Carolina: McFarland, 2010. {{ISBN|978-0-7864-5992-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several [[Nick Jr.]] shows such as ''[[Blue's Clues]]'', ''[[Team Umizoomi]]'', and ''[[Dora the Explorer]]'' as well as a few non-Nick Jr. cartoons had characters talking to the child watching the show and encouraging them to participate in the story, some shows used a child viewer voice calling the answer while some shows didn't use a voice at all, some of their shows though, such as the shows they distribute from [[Nelvana Limited]], don't use the fourth wall breaks.

The [[Netflix]] series ''[[A Series of Unfortunate Events (TV series)|A Series of Unfortunate Events]]'', based on the [[Daniel Handler]]'s [[A Series of Unfortunate Events|book series of the same name]], incorporates some of the narrative elements from the books by having Lemony Snicket as a narrator character (played by [[Patrick Warburton]]) speaking directly to the television viewer that frequently breaks the fourth wall to explain various literary wordplay that was included in the books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2017/01/13/a-series-of-unfortunate-events-netflix-2004-film-comparison/96533010/ | title = How Netflix's 'Series of Unfortunate Events' outshines the 2004 film | first = Kelly | last = Lawler | date = 13 January 2017 | accessdate = 13 January 2017 | work = [[USA Today]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In video games===
Given their interactive nature, nearly all video games break the fourth wall by asking for the player's participation. But beyond the obvious ways in which video games break the fourth wall (e.g. by having UI elements on the screen, etc.), there are several other ways that games have done this. These can include having the character face the direction of the player/screen, having a self-aware character that recognizes that they are in a video game, or having secret or bonus content set outside the game's narrative that can either extend the game world (such as with the use of [[false document]]s) or provide "behind the scenes" type content. But since video games are inherently much more interactive than traditional films and literature, defining what truly breaks the fourth wall in the video game medium becomes difficult.&lt;ref name="Gamasutra circular"&gt;{{cite web | URL = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/132475/a_circular_wall_reformulating_the_.php?print=1 | title = A Circular Wall? Reformulating the Fourth Wall for Video Games | first = Steven | last = Conway | date = 22 July 2009 | accessdate = 23 January 2017 | work = [[Gamasutra]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steven Conway, writing for ''[[Gamasutra]]'', suggests that in video games, many purported examples of breaking the fourth wall are actually better understood as ''relocations'' of the fourth wall or expansions of the "[[Magic circle (virtual worlds)|magic circle]]" (the fictional game world) to encompass the player.&lt;ref name="Gamasutra circular" /&gt; This is in contrast to traditional fourth wall breaks, which break the audience's illusion or [[suspension of disbelief]], by acknowledging them directly.&lt;ref name="Gamasutra circular"/&gt; Conway argues that this expansion of the magic circle in video games actually serves to more fully immerse a player into the fictional world rather than take the viewer out of the fictional world, as is more common in traditional fourth wall breaks. An example of this expansion of the magic circle can be found in the game ''[[Evidence: The Last Ritual]]'', in which the player receives an in-game email at their real-life email address and must visit out-of-game websites to solve some of the puzzles in the game. Other games may expand the magic circle to include the game's hardware. For example, ''[[X-Men (1993 video game)|X-Men]]'' for the Mega Drive/Genesis required players to reset their game console at a certain point to reset the X-Men's in-game Hazard Room, while ''[[Metal Gear Solid]]'' asked the player to put the [[DualShock]] controller on their neck to simulate a back massage being given in-game.&lt;ref name="Gamasutra circular"/&gt;

Other examples include the idle animation of [[Sonic the Hedgehog]] in his games where the on-screen character would look to the player and tap his foot impatiently if left alone for a while, and one level of ''[[Max Payne (video game)|Max Payne]]'' has the eponymous character come to the realization they are in a video game, and narrate what the player sees as part of the UI.&lt;ref name="gamasutra circular"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/132475/a_circular_wall_reformulating_the_.php?print=1 | title = A Circular Wall? Reformulating the Fourth Wall for Video Games | first = Steven | last = Conway | date = 22 July 2009 | accessdate = 23 January 2017 | work = [[Gamasutra]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Eternal Darkness]]'', which included a sanity meter, would simulate various common computer glitches to the player as the sanity meter drained, including the [[Blue Screen of Death]].&lt;ref name="gamasutra circular"/&gt; [[The Stanley Parable]] is also a well known example of this, as the narrator from the game constantly tries to reason with the player, even going so far as to beg the player to switch off the game at one point.

=== In literature ===
The method of breaking the fourth wall in literature is typically referred to as [[metafiction]]. Metafiction genre occurs when a character within a literary work acknowledges the reality that they are in fact a fictitious being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/metafiction|title=Definition Metafiction|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the fourth wall in literature can be traced back as far as ''The Canterbury Tales'' and ''Don Quixote''. However, it was popularized in the early 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century during the Post-Modern literary movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Metafiction – The Theory and Practice of Self-Conscious Fiction|last=Waugh|first=Patricia|publisher=Routledge|year=1984|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists like Virginia Woolf in ''To the Lighthouse'' and Kurt Vonnegut in ''Breakfast of Champions'' used the genre to question the accepted knowledge and sources of the culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://commons.clarku.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1004&amp;context=surj|title=Metafiction as Genre Fiction|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of metafiction or breaking the fourth wall in literature varies from that on stage in that the experience is not communal but personal to the reader and develops a self-consciousness within the character/reader relationship that works to build trust and expand thought. This does not involve acknowledgment of a character’s fictive nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dramaturgy and Architecture|last=Turner|first=Cathy|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Breaking the fourth wall in literature is not always metafiction. Modern examples of breaking the fourth wall include Ada Palmer’s ''Terra Ignota''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crookedtimber.org/2017/04/18/a-dialog-on-narrative-voice-complicity-and-intimacy/|title=A dialog on narrative voice complicity and intimacy|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and William Goldman’s ''The Princess Bride''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tor.com/2015/12/24/meta-irony-narrative-frames-and-the-princess-bride/|title=Meta-irony Narrative Frames and the Princess Bride|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
When [[phoneme]]s are in free variation, speakers are sometimes strongly aware of the fact (especially if such variation is noticeable only across a dialectal or sociolectal divide), and will note, for example, that ''tomato'' is pronounced differently in British and American English (/təˈmɑːˌtəʊ/ and /təˈmeɪˌtoʊ/ respectively),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/free-variation-phonetics-1690780|title=Free Variation in Phonetics: You Say 'Tomato,' I Say 'Tomahto'|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2017-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; or that ''either'' has two pronunciations that are distributed fairly randomly. However, only a very small proportion of English words show such variations. In the case of [[allophones]], however, free variation is exceedingly common and, along with differing intonation patterns, variation in allophony is the most important single feature in the characterization of regional accents.&lt;ref name=Clark /&gt;

English's [[deep orthography]] and the language's wide variety of [[accent (sociolinguistics)|accents]] often cause confusion, even for native speakers, on how written words should be pronounced. That allows for a significant degree of free variation to occur in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dialectblog.com/2011/10/29/free-variation-isnt-so-free/|title=When Free Variation Isn’t So Free|last=Ben|date=2011-10-29|website=Dialect Blog|access-date=2017-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==English examples==
*The [[Rhotic consonant|rhotic consonant]] /r/ is in a free variation between the [[alveolar approximant]], [[retroflex approximant]], [[alveolar flap]] and [[alveolar trill]], although all of these save for the first one are considered dialectal and rare.
*[[Glottalization]] of [[voicelessness|voiceless]] [[stop consonant|stops]] in word-final position: for example, the word ''stop'' may be pronounced with a plain unaspirated {{IPA|[p]}}, {{IPA|[stɑp]}}, or with a glottalized {{IPA|[pˀ]}}, {{IPA|[stɑpˀ]}}, also called a [[glottal stop|glottal stop or glottal plosive]].
*The word ''economics'' may be pronounced with {{IPA|/i/}} or {{IPA|/ɛ/}} in the first syllable; although individual speakers may prefer one or the other and one may be more common in some [[dialect]]s than others, both forms are encountered within a single dialect and sometimes even within a single [[idiolect]].
*The [[comparative]] of many [[disyllabic]] [[adjective]]s can be formed either with the word ''more'' or with the [[suffix]] ''-er'', for example ''more stupid'' or ''stupider''.
*In the words ''either'' and ''neither', "ei" can be pronounced as either /iː/ or /aɪ/&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/free-variation-phonetics-1690780|title=Free Variation in Phonetics: You Say 'Tomato,' I Say 'Tomahto'|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2017-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Loanwords, especially of [[French language|French]] and [[Latin]] origin, can often have multiple different pronunciations, such as ''route'', which can be pronounced as either /raʊt/ (a more [[anglicisation|anglicized pronunciation]]) or /ru:t/ (a pronunciation more akin to French)

'''Gender transposition''' is a term in [[linguistics]] to describe the substitution of a gendered personal pronoun for the other gendered form.  When used to describe a woman, this would be using the pronouns ''his'' or ''him'' instead of ''her'', and ''he'' instead of ''she''.  For men, it would be the reverse.

Often used in the [[Cryptolect|argot]] of [[gay]] [[men]], it can be intended either as a put-down, a self-mocking appellation, a term of endearment, or neutrally.  It may be considered [[gay bashing]] or [[homophobic]] when used by [[heterosexual]] people to mock a [[gay]] [[person]].

'''Genlock''' ('''generator locking''') is a common technique where the video output of one source, or a specific reference signal from a [[signal generator]], is used to synchronize other picture sources together. The aim in video applications is to ensure the coincidence of signals in time at a combining or switching point. When video instruments are synchronized in this way, they are said to be ''generator-locked'', or ''genlocked''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mivs.com/documents/appnotes/an005.html |publisher=MicroImage Video Systems |title=An Overview of Genlock |accessdate=2014-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403120241/http://www.mivs.com/documents/appnotes/an005.html |archivedate=2015-04-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nvidia.com/object/IO_10793.html |publisher=NVIDIA |title=Genlock |accessdate=2012-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atis.org/tg2k/_genlock.html |publisher=ATIS Committee |title=genlock |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071227035958/http://www.atis.org/tg2k/_genlock.html |archivedate=2007-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roe|first=John H.|date=March–April 1950|title=The Genlock for Improved TV Programming|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-RCA-Broadcast-News/RCA-58.pdf|journal=RCA Broadcast News|volume=Number 58|pages= 11–12|via=americanradiohistory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible problems==
===Phase differences===
Video signals generated and output by generator-locked instruments are said to be [[wikt:syntonize|syntonized]]. Syntonized video signals will be precisely frequency-locked, but because of delays caused by the unequal transmission path lengths, the synchronized signals will exhibit differing phases at various points in the television system. Modern video equipment such as production switchers that have multiple video inputs often include a variable delay on each input to compensate for the phase differences and time all the input signals to precise phase coincidence.

===Jumping===
Where two or more video signals are combined or being switched between, the horizontal and vertical timing of the picture sources should be coincident with each other. If they are not, the picture will appear to jump when switching between the sources whilst the display device re-adjusts the horizontal and/or vertical [[Raster scan|scan]] to correctly reframe the image.

===Color changes===
Where composite video is in use, the [[phase (waves)|phase]] of the [[chrominance]] [[subcarrier]] of each source being combined or switched should also be coincident.  This is to avoid changes in colour hue and/or saturation during a [[Film transition|transition]] between sources.

==Scope==
Generator locking can be used to synchronize as few as two isolated sources (e.g., a [[television camera]] and a [[videotape]] machine feeding a [[vision mixer]] (production switcher)), or in a wider facility where all the video sources are locked to a single synchronizing pulse generator (e.g., a fast-paced sporting event featuring multiple cameras and recording devices). Generator locking can also be used to ensure that multiple CRT monitors that appear in a movie are flicker-free. Generator locking is also used to synchronize two cameras for [[Stereoscopy|Stereoscopic 3D]] video recording.

===Broadcast systems===
In broadcast systems, an analog generator-lock signal usually consists of vertical and horizontal synchronizing pulses together with chrominance phase reference in the form of [[colorburst]]. No picture information is usually carried to avoid disturbing the timing signals, and the name ''reference'', ''[[black and burst]]'', ''color black'', or ''black burst'' is usually given to such a signal. A composite colour video signal inherently carries the same reference signals and can be used as a generator-locking signal, albeit at the risk of being disturbed by out-of-specification picture signals.

===High-definition===
Although some high-definition broadcast systems may use a standard-definition reference signal as a generator-locking reference signal, the use of tri-level synchronising pulses directly related to the frame and line rate is increasing within HD systems. A [[tri-level sync]] pulse is a signal that initially goes from 0 volts DC to a negative voltage, then a positive voltage, before returning to zero volts DC again. The voltage excursions are typically 300&amp;nbsp;mV either side of zero volts, and the duration each of the two excursions is the same as a particular number of digital picture samples.

==Connections==
Most [[television studio]] and [[professional video camera]]s have dedicated generator-locking ports on the camera. If the camera is tethered with a [[triaxial cable]] or optical fibre cable, the analog generator-locking signal is used to lock the camera control unit, which in turn locks the camera head by means of information carried within a data channel transmitted along the cable. If the camera is an [[Electronic News Gathering|ENG]]-type camera, one without a triax/fibre connection or without a dockable head, the generator-locking signal is carried through a separate cable from the video.

==Natlock and Icelock==
''Natlock'' is a picture-source synchronizing system using audio tone signals to describe the timing discrepancies between composite video signals, whilst ''Icelock'' uses digital information conveyed in the [[vertical blanking interval]] of a composite video signal.

'''Gunavarma I''' was an early [[Kannada language]] poet who authored two ''Mahakavya'' (epic poems), the ''Shudraka'' and the ''Harivamsha'' around 900 CE.

His works are considered extinct but are found referenced in later years. According to historians Kamath and Narasimhacharya (also a Kannada language expert), he was patronised by [[Western Ganga Dynasty]] King Ereganga Neetimarga II (also called Ereyappa) in  the late 9th century and early 10th century period.&lt;ref&gt;Kamath (2001), p50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Narasimhacharya (1988), p18&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7790">'''Abbreviations''' ({{Lang-he-n|ראשי תיבות}}) are a common part of the '''[[Hebrew language]]''', with many organizations, places, people and concepts known by their abbreviations.

==Typography==
[[Acronym]]s in Hebrew use a special [[punctuation]] mark called [[gershayim]] (&lt;span style="font-size:large;"&gt;[[״]]&lt;/span&gt;). This mark is placed between the last two letters of the non-inflected form of the acronym (e.g. "report" in singular is "{{Hebrew|דו״ח}}," hence the plural "{{Hebrew|דו״חות}}")&lt;span style="unicode-bidi:bidi-override"&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=he:כללי הפיסוק – יא. גרשיים, סעיף 30|publisher=[[Academy of the Hebrew Language]]|url=http://hebrew-academy.huji.ac.il/hahlatot/Punctuation/Pages/P33.aspx|language=Hebrew |trans-title=Punctuation — select rules |accessdate=2010-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Acronyms can be formed from strings of single initial letters, e.g. "{{Hebrew|[[:he:פזצט"א|פזצט״א]]}}" pazátsta (for {{Hebrew|פול, זחל, צפה, טווח, אש}}), or multiple initial letters, e.g. {{Hebrew|ארה״ק}} (for {{Hebrew|ארץ הקודש}}, the Holy Land) or {{Hebrew|ראשל״צ}} ráshlats (for {{Hebrew|ראשון לציון}}, [[Rishon LeZion]]).

If the acronym is read as is, then the spelling should be with a [[final form]] letter. If, on the other hand, the acronym is read as the complete phrase or read as the individual letters, then it should be spelled with a medial form letter.&lt;ref name=hebrewAc /&gt; In practice, this rule is more often than not ignored, and the acronyms spelled either way.

[[Abbreviation]]s that are truncations of a single word, consisting of the first letter or first several letters of that word (as opposed to acronyms formed from initials or truncations of more than one word) are denoted using the punctuation mark [[geresh]] (&lt;span style="font-size:large;"&gt;{{Hebrew|[[׳]]}}&lt;/span&gt;) by placing the sign after the last letter of the abbreviation (e.g. "Ms.": "&lt;span&gt;{{Hebrew|גב׳}}&lt;/span&gt;").&lt;ref name=hebrewAc&gt;{{cite web|script-title=he:הפיסוק - מבחר כללים|publisher=[[Academy of the Hebrew Language]] |url=http://hebrew-academy.huji.ac.il/hahlatot/Punctuation/Pages/P32.aspx|language= Hebrew |trans-title=Punctuation — select rules|accessdate=2010-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in practice, single and double quotes are often used instead of the special punctuation marks (for which most keyboards do not have keys), with the single quote used both in acronyms{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} and abbreviations.

==Pronunciation==
Often (and especially when they describe a noun), Hebrew acronyms are pronounced by the insertion of a vowel sound (usually {{IPA-he|a|}}) between the letters. These vowels often appear in transliterations to other scripts. Examples include [[Shas]] ({{Hebrew|ש״ס}}), [[Tanakh]] ({{Hebrew|תנ״ך}}) and [[Shin Bet|Shabak]] ({{Hebrew|שב״כ}}). There are exceptions to the use of "a", such as [[Irgun|Etzel]] ({{Hebrew|אצ״ל}}).

When one of the letters is [[waw (letter)|vav]] or [[yodh|yud]], these may be read as vowels ("u"/“o” and "i") instead: {{Hebrew|דו״ח}} (''duakh''/''dokh'' = {{Hebrew|דין וחשבון}}, judgement and account); {{Hebrew|אדמו״ר}} (''admor'' = {{Hebrew|אדוננו מורנו ורבנו}}, hasidic rebbe; {{Hebrew|שו״ת}} (''shut'' = {{Hebrew|שאלות ותשובות}}, questions and answers); {{Hebrew|סכו״ם}} (''sakum'' = {{Hebrew|סכין כף ומזלג}}, knife spoon and fork); {{Hebrew|תפו״ז}} (''tapuz'' = {{Hebrew|תפוח זהב}}, orange, lit. golden apple); {{Hebrew|או״ם}} (''um'' = {{Hebrew|האומות המאוחדות}}, the [[United Nations]]); {{Hebrew|ביל״ו}} [[Bilu]]; {{Hebrew|לח״י}} [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]]. (An exception is {{Hebrew|בית״ר}}, [[Beitar]], pronounced ''beytar''.)

Hebrew numbers (e.g. year numbers in the [[Hebrew calendar]]) are written the same way as acronyms, with gershayim before the last character, but pronounced as separate letter names. For example, &lt;span dir="rtl"&gt;&lt;!--{{#time:xhxjY}}--&gt;{{Hebrew|ה׳תשע״ה}}&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span dir="ltr"&gt;(5775&amp;nbsp;[[Anno Mundi|AM]], or 2014-2015&amp;nbsp;[[Common Era|CE]]&lt;!--{{#expr:{{#time:xjY}}-3761}}–{{#expr:{{#time:xjY}}-3760}}--&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) is pronounced hei-tav-shin-ayin-hei.

==Usage==
{{main article|List of Hebrew acronyms}}

===People===
Acronyms have been widely used in Hebrew since at least the [[Middle Ages]]. Several important [[rabbi]]s are referred to with acronyms of their names. For example, '''R'''abbi '''S'''hlomo ben '''Y'''itzchak is known as [[Rashi]], '''Ra'''v '''M'''oshe '''b'''en '''M'''aimon ([[Maimonides]]) is commonly known as ''Rambam'' (Hebrew: {{Hebrew|רמב״ם}}), '''Ra'''bbi '''M'''oshe '''b'''en '''N'''ahman ([[Nahmanides]]) is likewise known as the ''Ramban'' (Hebrew: {{Hebrew|רמב״ן}}), and [[Baal Shem Tov|'''B'''aal '''Sh'''em '''T'''ov]] is called the ''Besht'' (Hebrew: {{Hebrew|בעש״ט}}).

A number of such acronyms differ only in their last letter. They all begin with "Mahara-", as an acronym of the words ...{{Hebrew|מורנו הרב רבי}} (''Morenu Ha-Rav rabi ...'', Our teacher the [[Rabbi]] ...)." 
* "[[Maharam (disambiguation)|Maharam]]", with the final "m" standing for a number of names, such as '''M'''oshe and '''M'''eïr.
* "Maharal" for [[Judah Loew ben Bezalel|Judah '''L'''oew ben Bezalel]]
* "Maharash" for either [[Meir Wahl|Meir '''Sh'''auls]] or [[Shmuel Schneersohn]].

===Text===
The usage of Hebrew acronyms extends to liturgical groupings: the word ''[[Tanakh]]'' (Hebrew: תנ״ך) is an acronym for [[Torah|'''T'''orah]] (Five Books of Moses), [[Nevi'im|'''N'''evi'im]] (Book of Prophets), and [[Ketuvim|'''K'''etuvim]] (Hagiographa).

Most often, though, one will find use of acronyms as [[acrostic]]s, in both prayer, poetry (see [[Piyyut]]), and [[kabbalah|kabbalistic]] works. Because each Hebrew letter also has a numeric value, embedding an acrostic may give an additional layer of meaning to these works.

One purpose of acrostics was as a [[mnemonic]] or a way for an author to weave his name as a signature, or some other spiritual thought, into his work, at a time when much was memorized. Examples of prayers which contain acrostics include:
*[[Ashrei]]&amp;nbsp;– The first letter of every verse starts with a consecutive letter of the [[Hebrew alphabet]], with the omission of ''nun''.
*[[Lekhah Dodi]]&amp;nbsp;– The first letter of each stanza (not including the first and last) spells out "Shlomo Halevi" (Hebrew: שלמה הלוי) the name of the author [[Shlomo Halevi Alkabetz]].
*[[Shokhen Ad]]&amp;nbsp;– Lines are written so that letters line up vertically, spelling the name [[Yitzchak]], which may refer to the [[patriarch]] Yitzchak, or to an unknown [[author]].

'''Idris Bitlisi''' ({{circa}} 1455 – 15 November 1520), sometimes spelled '''Idris Bidlisi''', '''Idris-i Bitlisi''', or '''Idris-i Bidlisi''' ("Idris of [[Bitlis]]"), and fully ''Mevlana Hakimeddin İdris Mevlana Hüsameddin Ali-ül Bitlisi'', was an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] religious scholar and administrator from Bitlis (in modern [[Turkey]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sorularlaislamiyet.com/subpage.php?s=show_qna&amp;id=13420 Islamic Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; There is some controversy about his actual place of birth possibly having been around Diyarbekir (modern [[Diyarbakır]]). He wrote a major Ottoman literary work in [[Persian language|Persian]], named ''Hasht Bihisht'', which begun in 1502 and covered the reign of the first eight Ottoman rulers.&lt;ref&gt;Bertold Spuler. [https://books.google.nl/books?id=rD1vvympVtsC&amp;pg=PA68&amp;dq=persian+language+in+anatolia&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAmoVChMIpZ2B8PeRxgIVQZ8sCh10HAVJ#v=onepage&amp;q=persian%20language%20in%20anatolia&amp;f=false ''Persian Historiography &amp; Geography''] Pustaka Nasional Pte Ltd {{ISBN|9971774887}} p 68&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Bitlisi's father, [[Hosam al-Din Ali Bitlisi]], was a Sufi author strongly affliated to the Sufi [[Noorbakhshia Islam|Nurbakhshi]] sect.{{sfn|Yazici|2004|page=490}}  Like his father, Idris Bitlisi began his career in the [[Akkoyunlu]] court, in the service of Yakup Bey, son of [[Uzun Hasan]]. Later, he attracted the attention of the Ottoman sultan [[Selim I]] and served under him for much of the rest of his life. He joined Selim I in his campaigns against  the [[Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt|Mamluks]] and the [[Safavids]]. Bitlisi assisted the sultan in establishing an Ottoman administration in [[Egypt]], now the [[Egypt Eyalet]] (province) of the Ottoman Empire, after [[Ottoman conquest of Egypt|its conquest in 1517]]. He was appointed to numerous administrative positions of significant responsibility including [[Kazasker]] (district supreme administrative judge) of Diyarbekir and Arabia.

Bitlisi was instrumental in the incorporation of the territories of [[Urfa]] and [[Mosul]] into the Ottoman Empire without a war, and of [[Mardin]] after a long siege. He played a key role in driving the [[Alevi]] [[Yörüks|Turkomans]] from the whole region and the assimilation and Ottomanization of the remaining [[Sunni]] Kurds.

He died in [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] on 15 November 1520, shortly after the death of his longtime benefactor, Sultan [[Selim I]]. Bitlisi was buried in [[Eyüp]] neighborhood of Constantinople, in the garden of the complex known as "İdris Köşkü" (Idris House) or "İdris Çeşmesi" (Idris Fountain), built by his wife Zeynep Hatun.

Bitlisi wrote extensively towards the end of his life; his best known work is "Selim Şahname", an epic history of Selim I's reign.

'''Jebli''' (Jebelia) is a possibly [[Pre-Hilalian Arabic dialects|pre-Hilalian]] [[variety of Arabic|Arabic dialect]] spoken in the mountains of the north of [[Morocco]]. 

The historical development of this Moroccan dialect is unclear. 

The word ''jebli'' means "of/from the mountain". It is mainly spoken in the western and southern [[Rif]] by tribes of Sherifian, Berber and Morisco descent over the past ten centuries. 
*[[Jbala]]s: all the forty-four tribes speak Jebli Arabic ;
*[[Ghomaras]]: out of nine tribes, seven are fully Jebli-speaking, the two remaining are partially Jebli-speaking with a significant [[Ghomara language|Ghomara Berber]]-speaking community ;
*[[:fr:Sanhajas de Srayr|Sanhajas de Srayr]]: one Jebli-speaking tribe –Ketama– out of ten tribes, the remaining (nine) speak [[Senhaja language|Sanhaja Berber]] ;
*[[Riffian people|Riffians]]: out of twenty tribes, six are fully or partially Arabophone; among them, five speak Mountain Arabic −Targuist, Aït Itteftf, Aït Boufrah, Mestasa and Metioua− while the last one –Settout– speak Hilalian Arabic ;
*[[Ghiatas]], [[Maghraoua (Moroccan tribe)|Maghraouas]] and [[Meknassas (Moroccan tribe)|Meknassas]]: the three tribes –that aren't part of any larger confederacy– are fully Jebli-speaking ;
*Tribes of [[Zerhoun]] (Zerahnas) and the neighborhood of [[Sefrou]] (Kechtala, Behalil and Yazgha): although not belonging to the same ethno-linguistic group than Jebalas, their pre-Hilalian dialects are sometimes classified as belonging to the same macro-family (westernmost pre-Hilalian village dialects) than Jebli.

Jebli is heavily influenced by [[Berber languages|Berber]]; the grammar of Jebli is almost Berber while most the words are Arabic. The vocabulary is highly influenced by Spanish.

'''Karel Schoeman''' ({{IPA-af|ˈkɑːrəl ˈskuman}}, 26 October 1939 in [[Trompsburg]], South Africa  – 1 May 2017 in [[Bloemfontein]], South Africa) was a South African novelist, historian, translator and man of letters. He was the author of 19 novels and numerous works of history. He was one of South Africa's most honoured authors. Schoeman wrote primarily in [[Afrikaans]], although several of his non-fiction books were originally written in English. His novels are increasingly being translated into other languages, notably, English, French and Dutch.

==Life and career==
Born in 1939 in [[Trompsburg]], South Africa, Karel Schoeman matriculated in 1956 from [[Paarl Boys' High School]]. In 1959, he obtained a BA degree in languages from the [[University of the Free State]]. In 1961, he joined the [[Franciscan Order]] in [[Ireland]] as a novice for the priesthood, but then returned to [[Bloemfontein]] to obtain a Higher Diploma in Library Studies. During the 1970s, he went into voluntary exile, working first as a librarian in [[Amsterdam]] and then as a nurse in [[Glasgow, Scotland]]. He returned to South Africa in 1977 and worked until his retirement in 1998 as an archivist at the [[South African National Library]] in Cape Town. He then relocated to his town of birth, Trompsburg, where he lived for more than a decade before moving to Bloemfontein. In September 2008, he moved to the Noorderbloem retirement community, where he died on 1 May 2017.

Schoeman is known not only as a novelist, but is equally renowned as an historian and biographer. He has also published translations (especially of drama), several travel books and an autobiography. He won the most prestigious Afrikaans literary award, the [[Hertzog Prize]], three times: in 1971 (for ''By Fakkellig'', ''’n Lug vol helder wolke'' and ''Spiraal''), 1986 (''’n Ander land'') and in 1995 (''Hierdie lewe'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Hertzog Prize]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Media24 Books Literary Awards|Recht Malan Prize]] for "excellence in the field of non-fiction books" was awarded to him four times.&lt;ref&gt;[[Media24 Books Literary Awards]]&lt;/ref&gt; On the retirement of President [[Nelson Mandela]] in 1999, Schoeman was one of only two writers to be awarded the State President Award: Order for Excellent Service. In more recent years, his fiction garnered much praise in France, winning inter alia the prestigious [[Prix du Meilleur Livre Étranger]] in 2009. In the last years of his life, it was rumored that he was a possible candidate for the [[Nobel Prize]] in Literature.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latimes.com/books/jacketcopy/la-et-jc-who-will-win-the-nobel-prize-in-literature-20141006-story.html#&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://bookslive.co.za/blog/2014/10/02/punters-put-karel-schoeman-at-191-for-the-nobel-prize-in-literature/&lt;/ref&gt;

His 1972 novel, ''Na die Geliefde Land'' (literally: To the Beloved Country), was made into an award-winning feature film, ''[[Promised Land (2002 film)|Promised Land]]'' in 2002, with a screenplay by [[Jason Xenopoulos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0295538/?ref_=ttawd_awd_tt|title=Promised Land (2002)|date=24 January 2003|work=IMDb|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schoeman has produced and published several screenplays, including an adaptation of his first novel, ''Veldslag'', some of which were broadcast on South African national television during the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Burger &amp; Van Vuuren, ''Sluiswagter by die Dam van Stemme'', pp. 365–66, 370. His published screenplays include ''Besoek'' (1975), ''Somerpaleis'' (1975), ''Die Jare'' (1976) and ''Veldslag'' (1989). ''Op die Grens'' was broadcast in 1988, but never published.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schoeman committed suicide at a retirement center in South Africa at the age of 77, writing about dying with dignity in his suicide statement. A previous attempt failed when he was 75.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Kayeli''' ({{lang-id|Bahasa Kayeli}}) is an extinct [[Austronesian language]] once used by the [[Kayeli people]] of the [[Indonesia]]n island [[Buru]]. Two dialects were recognized, namely Leliali (Liliali) and Lumaete (Lumaiti, Mumaite, Lumara).

==History==
Whereas about 800 Kayeli people still live in the southern coast of the Kayeli Bay, in the eastern part of Buru, as of 1995, only 3 elderly people could speak the language and have not used it for three decades; other natives changed to the Ambon dialect of [[Malay language]] (''Melayu Ambon''). The  latter is widely used in the [[Maluku Islands]] as a second language and is a simplified form of Indonesian language with additions of the local lexicon.&lt;ref name = "etnologue" /&gt;

A 1983 literature review indicated about 1,000 speakers of Kayeli, however a field survey conducted in 1989 on Buru island located only four, two men and two women, all in their sixties. They have not used the language for over 30 years and had difficulties in summarizing the basic lexicon.&lt;ref&gt;C. E. Grimes in Margaret Florey [https://books.google.com/books?id=eNF4FxSd-LgC&amp;pg=PA74 Endangered Languages of Austronesia], Oxford University Press (2009) ISBN 
0199544549 p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; The last speaker of the Leliali dialect died in 1989 and no speakers of Lumaete could be located by then. A little more than 400 basic Kayeli words could be assembled, of which 13% were loanwords from Malay, Arabic, Portuguese and Sanskrit.&lt;ref name=b1&gt;B. D. Grimes in Thomas Edward Dutton, [[Darrell Tryon|Darrell T. Tryon]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=xOlI8czLshIC&amp;pg=PA260 Language contact and change in the Austronesian world], Walter de Gruyter, 1994 {{ISBN|3-11-012786-5}} p. 260, [http://www.eric.ed.gov/PDFS/ED384231.pdf PDF version]&lt;/ref&gt; They revealed significant phonetic and lexical difference with the Buru language – the lexical similarity of Leliali dialect with the closest Buru dialect of Masarete was 45%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=IDM Languages of Indonesia (Maluku)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The most detailed study of Kayeli language was conducted in the 1980s by Charles E.

'''Klavdiya Zakharovna Plotnikova-Andzhighatova''' ({{lang-ru|Кла́вдия Заха́ровна Пло́тникова-Анджига́това}}; c. 1893 – 20 September 1989&lt;ref name="Abondolo" /&gt;) was the last living speaker of the [[Kamassian language]] (and, as such, of any of the Sayan Samoyedic languages). Her father was a Russian named Zakhar Perov and her mother was a [[Kamassian]] named Afanasiya Andzhighatova. Plotnikova-Andzhighatova and her parents are on slot 14 on a chart Finnish linguist [[Kai Donner]] has made out of [[Abalakovo, Sayansky District, Krasnoyarsk Krai|Abalakovo]] Kamassian families.&lt;ref&gt;[http://elar.urfu.ru/handle/10995/27771 Новые данные о камасинском языке и камасинской топонимике]&lt;/ref&gt;

Plotnikova-Andzhighatova did not have the opportunity to speak Kamassian after 1950, because she had no friends who could speak it. Despite that, her Kamassian skills were fairly good and she was great help to philologists for the rest of her life. Plotnikova-Andzhighatova spoke fluent [[Russian language|Russian]], which she had learned in early childhood. With the decline of her native language, Russian became her only language. This affected her Kamassian skills, especially pronunciation, vocabulary and sentence structures. The Russian influence especially showed in structure of sentences and a weakening of the vocabulary: many [[morphology (linguistics)|morphologic]] forms and syntactic structures fell into disuse.&lt;ref name="Abondolo"&gt;D.

'''Krushnaji Prabhakar Khadilkar''' ([[Devanagari]]: कृष्णाजी प्रभाकर खाडिलकर) (25 November 1872 – 26 August 1948) was a [[Marathi people|Marathi]] writer from [[Maharashtra]], India. George calls him "a prominent lieutenant of [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak|Lokmanya Tilak]]". He was editor of [[Kesari (newspaper)|Kesari]], [[Lokmanya (newspaper)|Lokmanya]] and [[Nava Kaal|Navakal]]. Khadilkar in the beginning of his career wrote prose-plays, but achieved "even greater recognition" with plays like ''Svayamvara'' – which had songs which were based on Indian classical music. The notability of his dramatic technique, in his fifteen plays, was to "endow ancient Hindu legends and tales with contemporary political significance".&lt;ref name="GeorgeAkademi1995"&gt;{{cite book|author1=K. M. George|author2=Sahitya Akademi|title=Modern Indian Literature, an Anthology: Plays and prose|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eTXougCB-NMC&amp;pg=PA449|accessdate=15 February 2012|date=1 January 1995|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|isbn=978-81-7201-783-5|pages=449–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature (Volume Two) (Devraj To Jyoti), remarks that while [[Annasaheb Kirloskar]] "laid the foundation of popular sangit natak", it saw its great rise and gradual decline with the advent of Khadilkar. It considers Khadilkar along with [[Bal Gandharva]] as "the architect of what later on came to be called the golden age of the Marathi drama".&lt;ref name="Datta2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Amaresh Datta|title=The Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature (Volume Two) (Devraj To Jyoti)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zB4n3MVozbUC&amp;pg=PA1088|accessdate=15 February 2012|date=1 January 2006|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|isbn=978-81-260-1194-0|pages=1088–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921, after Tilak's death, ''Lokmanya'' was founded by admirers of Tilak. Khadilkar assumed its editorship. In 1923 he resigned because of his support of Gandhi's position in division of nationalist political opinion, under opposition from the promoters who rejected it. In March 1923 Khadilkar started his own newspaper [[Nava Kaal]], which "supported [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Gandhi]]'s programme" and its editorials "preached Gandhi's philosophy.&lt;ref name="(India)1972"&gt;{{cite book|author=National Centre for the Performing Arts (India)|title=Quarterly journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5bYiAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=15 February 2012|year=1972|publisher=[Bombay]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TopeCulture1986"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Trimbak Krishna Tope|author2=Maharashtra State Board for Literature &amp; Culture|title=Bombay and Congress movement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zHoeAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=15 February 2012|year=1986|publisher=Maharashtra State Board for Literature and Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Khadilkar was born on 25 November 1872 in [[Sangli]]. At age 15, he wrote a novel, and the next year he wrote a play. He received his B.A. degree in 1892 from [[Deccan College Post-Graduate and Research Institute|Deccan College]] in [[Pune]]. Out of his abiding interest in plays, he closely studied during his college years the plays of [[Sanskrit]] and English playwrights.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

==Association with Tilak==
In 1897, Khadilkar joined the editorial staff of Bal Gangadhar Tilak's daily ''[[Kesari (newspaper)|Kesari]]'' (केसरी). His ideas and literary style so closely matched those of Tilak that the readers of ''Kesari'' never knew as to which of the two had written the editorials appearing in the newspaper. In 1908 the colonial government arrested Tilak on charges of sedition for an article written by Khadilkar.&lt;ref name="Ramaswamy2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Vijaya Ramaswamy|title=Re-searching Indian women|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oihkAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=12 February 2012|year=2003|publisher=Manohar|isbn=978-81-7304-496-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tilak was sentenced to six years [[Penal transportation|transportation]] to be served in [[Mandalay]].&lt;ref name="Vohra2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ranbir Vohra|title=The making of India: a historical survey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IDKoyGjFo44C&amp;pg=PA113|accessdate=12 February 2012|year=2001|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|isbn=978-0-7656-0711-9|pages=113–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1908–10, Khadilkar served as the chief editor of Tilak's English daily ''Maratha'' besides serving on the editorial board of ''Kesari''. In 1910, he left the editorship of both ''Kesari'' and ''Maratha'', but returned to work as the editor of ''Keasari'' during 1917–20.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===Plotted Nepalese invasion of India===
Khadilkar was a part of plot that envisioned the invasion of India by the only indedendent Hindu King of a part of India: The king of Nepal. This invasion was to spark an uprising within the country in his support, so that India would be one soverigh Hindu state under the King of Nepal. Tilak's trusted lieutenants [[Vasukaka Joshi]] and Khadilkar, entered Nepal, "where they set up a tile factory, as a respectale front for an arms and munitions plant designed to supply to the invading Nepalese army." A Maharashtrian school teacher Mataji, introduced the two to the King of Nepal. They received a contract to retile the palace roof. They were joined by Hanmantrao Kulkarni of [[Jabalpur]] and Ketkar from [[Gwalior]]. The King of Nepal was influenced to send Nepalese students to Japan for technical training. Joshi went to Japan and the United States. The German arms manufacturing machinery never arrived. The plot never "even approached fruition".&lt;ref name="Wolpert1962"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stanley A. Wolpert|title=Tilak and Gokhale: revolution and reform in the making of modern India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=De_ftH3bm-MC&amp;pg=PA326|accessdate=15 February 2012|year=1962|publisher=University of California Press|pages=326–|id=GGKEY:49PR049CPBX}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later career==
After Tilak's death in 1920, Khadilkar worked as the editor of daily ''Lokamanya'' (लोकमान्य) during 1921–23. In 1923, he founded daily [[Nava Kaal|Nava Kal]] (नवा काळ), which supported Gandhi.&lt;ref name="(India)1972" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TopeCulture1986" /&gt; In 1929, British authorities imprisoned Khadilkar for a year for the crime of disloyalty to the colonial government.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Khadilkar presided over [[Marathi Sahitya Sammelan]] at [[Nagpur]] in 1933.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

He died on 26 August 1948.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

==''Kichak Vadh''==

''Kichak Vadh'' (The Assassination of Kichak) (1907) is a play based on an episode in the [[Mahabharat]],&lt;ref name="Hochmaninc1984"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stanley Hochman|author2=McGraw-Hill, inc|title=McGraw-Hill encyclopedia of world drama: an international reference work in 5 volumes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zo5os6d0rvMC&amp;pg=PA38|accessdate=13 February 2012|year=1984|publisher=VNR AG|isbn=978-0-07-079169-5|pages=38–}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kichak]] is a minister at the court of Virat who attempts to molest [[Draupadi]], he is assassinated by her husband [[Bhima]] as a result. The play was a manifestation of resistance to British rule. This molestation is used as a metaphor for the policies of the British colonial government in India. Kichak represented [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Lord Curzon]]: [[Viceroy]] to the King, just as Kichak was minister to King Virat; Draupadi represented India and Bhima represented an extremist nationalist, in contrast to [[Yudhishthira|Yudhishtar]], standing for moderate nationalism. ''The Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature...'' states that "Kichaka was cast in the mould of the then Viceroy, Lord Curzon, and some of his aggressively arrogant utterences (like, 'the rulers are rulers and the slaves are slaves') found direct echoes in the words of Kichaka, while the popular mood of resentment and revolt was vehemently expressed by the fiery speeches of Draupadi and Bhima"&lt;ref name="DattaAkademi1987"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Amaresh Datta|author2=Sahitya Akademi|title=Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature: K to Navalram|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QaIRAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=15 February 2012|year=1987|publisher=Sahitya Akademi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bhatia considers that the playwright contrasts the aggression and hatred of the government for its colonial subjects with the resistance of those who attempt rescue the nation from colonial evils. Themes of sacrifice, war and duty "sharpened the quest of freedom". The play was an allegorical attack on the colonial government.&lt;ref name="Bhatia2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nandi Bhatia|title=Acts of authority, acts of resistance: theater and politics in colonial and postcolonial India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zIr2TX3NiAwC&amp;pg=PA46|accessdate=12 February 2012|date=20 May 2004|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=978-0-472-11263-0|pages=46–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nagendra considers the play as a notable example of the use of a mythological character as a symbol of oppression.&lt;ref name="Nagendra1989"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nagendra|title=Jayashankar Prasad his Mind and Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pZEk3D2-4e8C&amp;pg=PA172|accessdate=12 February 2012|year=1989|publisher=Prabhat Prakashan|pages=172–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Audience reaction to Kichak Vadh===
[[Ignatius Valentine Chirol]]'s 1910 book ''Indian Unrest'' describes the play's plot and explains the allegories. According to Chirol, the play provides a response to [[John Morley, 1st Viscount Morley of Blackburn]], who ridiculed the boast of radical nationalists that they could free their country and defend it from invaders. Chirol suggests that any Englishman who saw the play would remember vividly the tense scowling face of the men as they watch the outrages of Kichak and tearful eyes of the ladies as they watch "Draupadi's entreaties", "their scorn for Yudhishthira's tameness, their admiration of Bhima's passionate protests, and the deep hum of satisfaction which approves the slaughter of the tyrant."&lt;ref name="Indian Unrest"&gt;{{cite book|title=Indian Unrest|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ABDCwzf5Za8C&amp;pg=PA337|accessdate=13 February 2012|publisher=Forgotten Books|isbn=978-1-4400-7748-7|pages=337–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ban===
The Press Act in India was requested for sanction by the Government of India, in response to the sudden rise in revolutionary activities in 1909. Morley refused in deference to hostile reactions from the English public and "'Friends of India' members of the Parliament." [[Charles Augustus Kincaid|Kincaid]] was asked to write on the "seditious climate fostered by the native papers". Kincaid wrote four articles in the Times, amongst them was "A seditious play of the Deccan', a critique of the Marathi play Kichak Vadh by K. P. Khadilkar" as an example of sedition.&lt;ref name="DossalMaloni1999"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mariam Dossal|author2=Ruby Maloni|title=State intervention and popular response: western India in the nineteenth century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7EkGKKvJ0lsC&amp;pg=PA166|accessdate=12 February 2012|date=1 January 1999|publisher=Popular Prakashan|isbn=978-81-7154-855-2|pages=166–}}&lt;/ref&gt; These articles written on 18 January 1910, not only hastened the passage of the India Press Act of 1910 but also called for Kichak Vadh to be banned. The articles were reproduced by [[The Times of India]] and Bombay Gazette on 5 and 7 February 1910 respectively. The play was finally banned.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

''The Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature: K to Navalram'' mentions that "the London Times, in an eloquent outburst against this play, said in effect, Khadilkar is a most dangerous extremist, and Kichak Vadha is a cleverly veiled incitement to murder the European officials."&lt;ref name="DattaAkademi1987"/&gt;

Sarkar considers Khadilkar a versatile genius who created "several types of womanhood in some of his dramas in verse."

'''''Language Attitudes among Arabic–French Bilinguals in Morocco''''' ({{ISBN|978-0905028156}}) is a 1983 book by Abdelâli Bentahila, published by the Clevedon company of [[Avon (county)|Avon, England]]. The book discusses [[Arabic language|Arabic]]-[[French language|French]] bilingualism in [[Morocco]].

The author was a Moroccan linguist who, after receiving his PhD, began teaching in the city of [[Fes]] (Fez) in Morocco.&lt;ref name=Weinstein437&gt;Weinstein, p. 437.&lt;/ref&gt; The book focused on "balanced bilinguals" who attended bilingual secondary schools and/or universities.&lt;ref name=Stevens73&gt;Stevens, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book Bentahila argued that the Moroccan officials do not consult their people on the language planning issue and therefore do not find success with their language planning.&lt;ref name=Weinstein437/&gt; He also concludes that the bilingual Moroccans who establish the education system believe both Classical Arabic and French have an important role in Morocco's development and their own lives, and therefore they are highly loyal to both languages.&lt;ref name=Weinstein437/&gt;

As part of his research, Bentahila collected data from 432 Moroccans,&lt;ref name=Weinsteinp438&gt;Weinstein, p. 438.&lt;/ref&gt; aged 17 to the late 30s who had been educated in both Arabic and French. His subjects included clerks, secretaries, students, and teachers.&lt;ref name=Weinstein437/&gt;

==Contents==
The book has seven chapters.&lt;ref name=Stevens73/&gt; The initial portion of the book discusses the history of the languages of instruction in the Moroccan school system from the pre-colonial through post-colonial periods.&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein, p. 437-438.&lt;/ref&gt; The next portion involves the author discussing the results of his questionnaire. and includes a survey of the literature about the language situation from inside and outside the Maghreb. The book has a chapter about comparative attitudes towards Moroccan Arabic, Classical Arabic, and French.&lt;ref name=Weinsteinp438/&gt; There is also a chapter on language planning in Morocco.&lt;ref name=Weinsteinp439&gt;Weinstein, p. 439.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Paul B. Stevens of the ''[[Journal of Language and Social Psychology]]'' said that it was the first book-length work on bilingualism in North Africa written in the English language, and for writing the book Bentahila "is to be applauded on several counts."&lt;ref name=Stevens73/&gt; He said "Taken as a whole, Bentahila's book is a worthwhile one and, some of the remarks which follow notwithstanding, it deserved to be read."&lt;ref name=Stevens74&gt;Stevens, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brian Weinstein of the ''[[Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development]]'' wrote that the book is "an important addition to the literature on language attitudes" and that it "also is valuable methodologically and for the implicit and explicit suggestions for further research into attitudes and their relationship to social change or social stagnation."&lt;ref name=Weinsteinp439/&gt;

[[File:A (capital and small).svg|thumb|159px|The lower-case "a" and upper-case "A" are the two case variants of the first letter in the [[English alphabet]].]]

'''Letter case''' (or just '''case''') is the distinction between the [[Letter (alphabet)|letters]] that are in larger '''upper case''' (also ''uppercase'', ''capital letters'', ''capitals'', ''caps'', ''large letters'', or more formally ''majuscule'') and smaller '''lower case''' (also ''lowercase'', ''small letters'', or more formally ''minuscule'') in the written representation of certain [[language]]s. The [[writing system]]s that distinguish between the upper and lower case have two parallel sets of letters, with each letter in one set usually having an equivalent in the other set. The two case variants are alternative representations of the same letter: they have the same name and [[pronunciation]] and are treated identically when sorting in [[alphabetical order]].

Letter case is generally applied in a mixed-case fashion, with both upper- and lower-case letters appearing in a given piece of text. The choice of case is often prescribed by the [[grammar]] of a language or by the conventions of a particular discipline. In [[orthography]], the upper case is primarily reserved for special purposes, such as the first letter of a [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] or of a [[proper noun]], which makes the lower case the more common variant in regular text. In some contexts, it is conventional to use one case only. For example, [[Engineering drawing|engineering design drawings]] are typically labelled entirely in upper-case letters, which are easier to distinguish than the lower case, especially when space restrictions require that the lettering be small. In [[mathematics]], on the other hand, letter case may indicate the relationship between objects, with upper-case letters often representing "superior" objects (e.g. ''X'' could be a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] containing the generic member ''x'').

The terms ''upper case'' and ''lower case'' can be written as two consecutive words, connected with a hyphen (''upper-case'' and ''lower-case'' – particularly if they [[Compound modifier|pre-modify]] another noun&lt;ref name="Bloomberg" /&gt;), or as a single word (''uppercase'' and ''lowercase''). These terms originated from the common layouts of the shallow [[Drawer (furniture)|drawers]] called ''[[type case]]s'' used to hold the [[movable type]] for [[letterpress printing]]. Traditionally, the capital letters were stored in a separate shallow tray or "case" that was located above the case that held the small letters.&lt;ref name="Typographia, an Historical Sketch of the Origin and Progress of the Art of Printing"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hansard|first1=Thomas Curson|title=Typographia, an Historical Sketch of the Origin and Progress of the Art of Printing|date=1825|pages=408, 4806|url=https://archive.org/details/typographiaanhi01hansgoog|accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Medieval Calligraphy: Its History and Technique|author=Marc Drogin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oHNtDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA37|page=37|publisher=Courier Corporation|year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Majuscule'' ({{IPAc-en|m|ə|ˈ|dʒ|ʌ|s|k|juː|l}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|æ|dʒ|ə|s|k|juː|l}}), for [[Paleography|palaeographers]], is technically any script in which the letters have very few or very short ascenders and descenders, or none at all (for example, the majuscule scripts used in the [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209]], or the [[Book of Kells]]). By virtue of their visual impact, this made the term majuscule an apt descriptor for what much later came to be more commonly referred to as uppercase letters.

''Minuscule'' refers to lower-case letters. The word is often spelled ''miniscule'', by association with the unrelated word ''miniature'' and the prefix ''mini-''. This has traditionally been regarded as a spelling mistake (since ''minuscule'' is derived from the word ''minus''&lt;ref name="Lewis 1890" /&gt;), but is now so common that some [[dictionaries]] tend to accept it as a nonstandard or variant spelling.&lt;ref name="AHD 2000" /&gt; ''Miniscule'' is still less likely, however, to be used in reference to lower-case letters.

== Typographical considerations ==
The [[glyph]]s of lower-case letters can resemble smaller forms of the upper-case glyphs restricted to the base band (e.g. "C/c" and "S/s", cf. [[small caps]]) or can look hardly related (e.g. "D/d" and "G/g"). Here is a comparison of the upper and lower case variants of each letter included in the [[English alphabet]] (the exact representation will vary according to the [[typeface]] and [[font]] used):

{| style="margin-left:1.5em;text-align:left;"
|-
!style="padding:0 1.0em;"| Upper case
| A || B || C || D || E || F || G || H || I || J || K || L || M || N || O || P || Q || R || S || T || U || V || W || X || Y || Z
|-
!style="padding:0 1.0em;"| Lower case
| a || b || c || d || e || f || g || h || i || j || k || l || m || n || o || p || q || r || s || t || u || v || w || x || y || z
|}

[[Typography|Typographically]], the basic difference between the majuscules and minuscules is not that the majuscules are big and minuscules small, but that the majuscules generally have the same height (although, depending on the typeface, there may be some exceptions, particularly with ''Q'' and sometimes ''J'' having a descending element; also, various [[diacritic]]s can add to the normal height of a letter). 

[[File:Typography Line Terms.svg|thumb|300px|Ascenders (as in "h") and descenders (as in "p") make the height of lower-case letters vary.]]
There is more variation in the height of the minuscules, as some of them have parts higher ([[Ascender (typography)|ascenders]]) or lower ([[descender]]s) than the typical size. Normally, ''b, d, f, h, k, l, t&amp;nbsp;''{{efn|In [[Antiqua (typeface class)|Roman Antiqua]] or other vertical fonts, the defunct [[Long s|Initial or Medial Long-s]], ſ, would have been an ascender; however, in italics, it would have been one of only two letters in the [[English alphabet|English or Expanded Latin Alphabet]] with both an ascender and a descender, the other being ''f''.&lt;br&gt;{{cite book | title = The History and Technique of Lettering | author = Alexander Nesbitt | edition = 1st | publisher = Dover Publications | year = 1957 | location = New York City | isbn = 0-486-20427-8}}}} are the letters with ascenders, and ''g, j, p, q, y'' are the ones with  descenders. In addition, with [[Text figures|old-style numerals]] still used by some traditional or classical fonts, ''6'' and ''8'' make up the ascender set, and ''3, 4, 5, 7'' and ''9'' the descender set.

== Bicameral script ==
{{original research|section|date=April 2015}}
[[File:Fountain pen writing (literacy).jpg|thumb|250px|[[Handwritten]] Cyrillic script]]

Writing systems using two separate cases are ''bicameral scripts''. Languages that use the [[Latin alphabet|Latin]], [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]], [[Greek alphabet|Greek]], [[Coptic alphabet|Coptic]], [[Armenian alphabet|Armenian]], [[Adlam alphabet|Adlam]], [[Warang Citi]], [[Cherokee syllabary|Cherokee]], and [[Osage alphabet|Osage]] scripts use letter cases in their written form as an aid to clarity. Other bicameral scripts, which are not used for any modern languages, are [[Old Hungarian alphabet|Old Hungarian]],{{Citation needed|date=October 2018|reason=Wikipedia articles on Letter case and [[Unicase]] differ in their view of whether [[Old Hungarian alphabet]] actually has letter case distinction.}} [[Glagolitic alphabet|Glagolitic]], and [[Deseret alphabet|Deseret]]. The [[Georgian alphabet]] has several variants, and there were attempts to use them as different cases, but the modern written [[Georgian language]] does not distinguish case.

Many other writing systems make no distinction between majuscules and minuscules – a system called unicameral script or [[unicase]]. This includes most [[Syllabary|syllabic]] and other non-alphabetic scripts.

In scripts with a case distinction, lower case is generally used for the majority of text; capitals are used for capitalisation and [[Emphasis (typography)|emphasis]]. [[Acronym]]s (and particularly initialisms) are often written in [[All caps|all-caps]], depending on [[Acronym#Case|various factors]].

===Capitalisation===
{{Main article|Capitalization}}
Capitalisation is the [[writing]] of a [[word]] with its first [[letter (alphabet)|letter]] in uppercase and the remaining letters in lowercase. Capitalisation rules vary by [[language]] and are often quite complex, but in most modern languages that have capitalisation, the first word of every [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] is capitalised, as are all [[proper noun]]s. {{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Capitalisation in English, in terms of the general orthographic rules independent of context (e.g. title vs. heading vs. text), is universally standardised for [[formality|formal]] writing. Capital letters are used as the first letter of a sentence, a proper noun, or a [[proper adjective]]. The [[names of the days of the week]] and the names of the months are also capitalised, as are the first-person [[pronoun]] "I"&lt;ref name="Oliver #1"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.eslcafe.com/grammar/using_capital_letters01.html | title = Using Capital Letters (#1) | author = Dennis Oliver | website = Dave's ESL Cafe | access-date = 19 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[interjection]] "O" (although the latter is uncommon in modern usage, with "oh" being preferred). There are a few pairs of words of different meanings whose [[list of case sensitive English words|only difference is capitalisation]] of the first letter. [[Honorific]]s and personal [[title]]s showing rank or prestige are capitalised when used together with the name of the person (for example, "Mr.&amp;nbsp;Smith", "Bishop O'Brien", "Professor Moore") or as a direct address, but normally not when used alone and in a more general sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://web.mnstate.edu/hanson/MC210/MC210_AP_titles.htm | title = AP Style: Courtesy and Professional Titles | author = Nancy Edmonds Hanson | website = Minnesota State University | date = 25 August 2008 | access-date = 19 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://englishplus.com/grammar/00000049.htm | title = Capitalizing Titles of People | website = English Plus | date = 1997–2006 | access-date = 19 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be seen as customary to capitalise any word – in some contexts even a pronoun&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/qanda/data/faq/topics/Capitalization/faq0004.html | title = Capitalization | website = The Chicago Manual of Style Online | access-date = 19 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; – referring to the [[deity]] of a [[Monotheism|monotheistic religion]].

Other words normally start with a lower-case letter. There are, however, situations where further capitalisation may be used to give added emphasis, for example in headings and publication titles (see below). In some traditional forms of poetry, capitalisation has conventionally been used as a marker to indicate the beginning of a [[Line (poetry)|line of verse]] independent of any grammatical feature.

Other languages vary in their use of capitals. For example, in [[German language|German]] all nouns are capitalised (this was previously common in English as well, mainly in the 17th and 18th centuries), while in [[Romance languages|Romance]] and most other European languages the names of the days of the week, the names of the months, and adjectives of nationality, religion and so on normally begin with a lower-case letter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://libguides.dickinson.edu/c.php?g=56073&amp;p=1112966 | title = Citing Sources: Capitalization and Personal Names in Foreign Languages | website = Waidner-Spahr Library | publisher = Dickinson | access-date = 30 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, in some languages it is customary to capitalise [[T–V distinction|formal polite pronouns]], for example ''De'', ''Dem'' ([[Danish language|Danish]]), ''Sie'', ''Ihnen'' (German), and ''Vd'' or ''Ud'' (short for ''usted'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]).

Informal communication, such as [[texting]], [[instant messaging]] or a handwritten [[sticky note]], may not bother to follow the conventions concerning capitalisation, but that is because its users usually do not expect it to be formal.&lt;ref name="Oliver #1" /&gt;

===Exceptional letters and digraphs===
* The German letter "[[ß]]" only used to exist in lower case. The orthographical capitalisation does not concern "ß", which never occurs at the beginning of a word, and in the all-caps style it has traditionally been replaced by the [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]] "SS". Since June 2017, however, [[capital ẞ]] is accepted as an alternative in the all-caps style.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. {{citation|first=Kerstin |last=Güthert |url=http://www.rechtschreibrat.com/DOX/rfdr_PM_2017-06-29_Aktualisierung_Regelwerk.pdf|title=PRESSEMITTEILUNG 29.6.2017 Amtliches Regelwerk der deutschen Rechtschreibung aktualisiert |publisher=[[Council for German Orthography]] |accessdate=2017-06-29 |year=2017 |page=1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The Greek upper-case letter "[[Sigma|Σ]]" has two different lower-case forms: "ς" in word-final position and "σ" elsewhere. In a similar manner, the Latin upper-case letter "[[S]]" used to have two different lower-case forms: "s" in word-final position and "&lt;big&gt; ſ &lt;/big&gt;" elsewhere. The latter form, called the [[long s]], fell out of general use before the middle of the 19th century, except for the countries that continued to use [[Blackletter]] typefaces such as [[Fraktur]]. When Blackletter type fell out of general use in the mid-20th century, even those countries dropped the long s.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}
* Unlike most Latin-script languages, which link the dotless upper-case "[[I]]" with the dotted lower-case "i", [[Turkish language|Turkish]] has both a [[dotted and dotless I]], each in both upper and lower case. Each of the two pairs ("&lt;big&gt;İ/i&lt;/big&gt;" and "&lt;big&gt;I/ı&lt;/big&gt;") represent a distinctive [[phoneme]].
* In some languages, specific digraphs may be regarded as single letters, and in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], the digraph "[[IJ (digraph)|IJ/ij]]" is even capitalised with both components written in uppercase (for example, "IJsland" rather than "Ijsland").&lt;ref name="Taaladvies" /&gt; In other languages, such as [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], various digraphs are regarded as single letters for collation purposes, but the second component of the digraph will still be written in lower case even if the first component is capitalised. Similarly, in [[South Slavic languages]] whose orthography is coordinated between the Cyrillic and Latin scripts, the Latin digraphs "[[Lj (letter)|ǈ/ǉ]]", "[[Nj (digraph)|ǋ/ǌ]]" and "[[Dž (digraph)|ǅ/ǆ]]" are each regarded as a single letter (like their Cyrillic equivalents "[[Lje|Љ/љ]]", "[[Nje|Њ/њ]]" and "[[Dzhe|Џ/џ]]", respectively), but only in all-caps style should both components be in upper case (e.g. ǈiǉan–ǇIǇAN, ǋoǌa–ǊOǊA, ǅiǆa–ǄIǄA).{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} [[Unicode]] designates a [[Digraph (orthography)#In Unicode|single character]] for each case variant (i.e., upper case, title case and lower case) of the three digraphs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0180.pdf | title = Latin Extended-B | at = U+01C4, U+01C5, U+01C6, U+01C7, U+01C8, U+01C9, U+01CA, U+01CB, U+01CC | publisher = Unicode | format = PDF | access-date = 5 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In English, some families whose surname starts with F write it as "[[List of digraphs in Latin alphabets#F|ff]]".
* In the [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] orthography, the [[ʻOkina|{{okina}}okina]] is a [[phonemic]] symbol that visually resembles a left single [[quotation mark]]. Representing the [[glottal stop]], the {{okina}}okina can either be characterized as a letter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.blondvoyage.com/single-post/2015/08/12/Why-I-Spell-it-Hawai%E2%80%98i-and-not-Hawaii-and-Why-You-Should-Too | title = Why I Spell it Hawai‘i and not Hawaii, and Why You Should, Too | website = Blond Voyage | access-date = 6 August 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or a [[diacritic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.hawaii.edu/site/info/diacritics.php | title = Hawaiian Language Online | website = The University of Hawai‘i | access-date = 6 August 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a unicase letter, the {{okina}}okina is unaffected by capitalisation; it is the following letter that is capitalised instead. According to the [[Unicode]] standard, the {{okina}}okina is formally encoded as {{unichar|2BB|Modifier letter turned comma}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U02B0.pdf | title = Spacing Modifier Letters | at = U+02BB | publisher = Unicode | format = PDF | access-date = 6 August 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is not uncommon to substitute this with a similar [[punctuation]] character, such as the left single quotation mark or an [[apostrophe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://keoladonaghy.com/olelo-tech/%E2%80%98olelo-hawai%E2%80%98i-on-the-www/ | title = ‘Ōlelo Hawai‘i on the WWW: A.K.A., How To Give Good ‘Okina | website = KeolaDonaghy.com | access-date = 6 August 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In [[Georgian alphabet|Georgian]], some authors use isolated letters from the ancient [[Asomtavruli]] alphabet within a text otherwise written in the modern [[Georgian alphabet#Mkhedruli|Mkhedruli]] in a fashion that is reminiscent of the usage of upper-case letters in the Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic alphabets.
* In the [[Japanese writing system]], an author has the option of switching between [[kanji]], [[hiragana]], [[katakana]], and [[rōmaji]]. In particular, every hiragana character has an equivalent katakana character, and vice versa. Because this resembles the Latin alphabet's two cases, romanised Japanese sometimes uses lowercase letters to represent words that would be written in hiragana, and uppercase letters to represent words that would be written in katakana. Some kana syllabograms can be written in smaller type when they modify or combine with the preceding sign ([[yōon]] and [[sokuon]]).

===Case styles===
&lt;!--[[Capital punishment]] hatnote links here for "capital case". --&gt;
[[File:Headline.png|thumb|182px|Alternating all-caps and headline styles at the start of a ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' report published in November 1919. (The event reported is [[Arthur Eddington]]'s [[Experimentum crucis|test]] of [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s [[General relativity|theory of general relativity]].)]]

In English, a variety of case styles are used in various circumstances:

; {{anchor|Sentence case|Sentence Case|Sentence-case|Sentencecase}}Sentence case
: "[[The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog]]"&lt;br /&gt; A mixed-case style in which the first word of the sentence is capitalised, as well as proper nouns and other words as required by a more specific rule. This is generally equivalent to the baseline universal standard of formal English orthography.

; {{anchor|Title case|Title Case|Title-case|Titlecase|Capital case|Capital Case|Capital-case|Capitalcase|Start case|Start Case|Start-case|Startcase|Initial caps|Initial Caps|Initial-caps|Initialcaps}}Title case (capital case, headline style)
: "The Quick Brown Fox Jumps over the Lazy Dog"&lt;br /&gt; A mixed-case style with all words capitalised, except for certain subsets (particularly [[Article (grammar)|articles]] and short [[preposition]]s and [[Conjunction (grammar)|conjunctions]]) defined by rules that are not universally standardised. The standardisation is only at the level of house styles and individual [[style manual]]s. {{crossref|printworthy=y|(See further explanation below at {{sectionlink||Headings and publication titles}}.)}} In [[text processing]], title case usually involves the capitalisation of all words irrespective of their [[part of speech]]. This simplified variant of title case is also known as ''start case'' or ''initial caps''.

; {{anchor|All caps|All-caps|All Caps|All capitals|All Capitals|All-capitals|Uppercase|Upper-case|Upper case|Upper Case|All uppercase|All Uppercase|All-uppercase|All upper-case|All upper case}}[[All caps]] (all uppercase)
: "THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG"&lt;br /&gt; A unicase style with capital letters only. This can be used in headings and special situations, such as for typographical emphasis in text made on a typewriter. With the advent of the [[Internet]], the all-caps style is more often used for emphasis; however, it is considered poor [[netiquette]] by some to type in all capitals, and said to be tantamount to shouting.&lt;ref name="RFC1855"&gt;RFC 1855 "Netiquette Guidelines"&lt;/ref&gt; Long spans of Latin-alphabet text in all upper-case are harder to read because of the absence of the [[Ascender (typography)|ascenders]] and [[descender]]s found in lower-case letters, which can aid recognition. In some cultures it is common to write family names in all caps to distinguish them from the given names, especially in identity documents such as passports.

; {{anchor|Small caps|Small-caps|Small Caps|Small capitals|Small Capitals|Small-capitals}}[[Small caps]]
: "{{smallcaps|The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog}}"&lt;br /&gt; Similar in form to capital letters but roughly the size of a lower-case "x", small caps can be used instead of lower-case letters and combined with regular caps in a mixed-case fashion. This is a feature of certain fonts such as [[Copperplate Gothic]]. According to various typographical traditions, the height of small caps can be equal to or slightly larger than the [[x-height]] of the typeface (the smaller variant is sometimes called ''petite caps'' and may also be mixed with the larger variant).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/features_pt.htm#pcap | title = Registered features – definitions and implementations | website = OpenType Layout tag registry | at = Tag:'pcap', Tag: 'smcp' | publisher = Microsoft | access-date = 24 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Small caps can be used for acronyms, names, mathematical entities, computer commands in printed text, business or personal printed stationery letterheads, and other situations where a given phrase needs to be distinguished from the main text.

; {{anchor|Lower case|Lower Case|Lower-case|All lowercase|All-lowercase|All Lowercase|All lower-case|All lower case}}All lowercase
: "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"&lt;br /&gt; A unicase style with no capital letters. This is sometimes used for artistic effect, such as in poetry. Also commonly seen in computer languages, and in informal electronic communications such as [[SMS language]] and [[instant messaging]] (avoiding the [[shift key]], to type more quickly).

====Headings and publication titles====
In English-language publications, various conventions are used for the capitalisation of words in [[Title (publishing)|publication title]]s and [[headline]]s, including chapter and section headings. The rules differ substantially between individual house styles.

The convention followed by many British [[publisher]]s (including scientific publishers, like [[Nature (journal)|Nature]], magazines, like ''[[The Economist]]'' and ''[[New Scientist]]'', and newspapers, like ''[[The Guardian]]'' and ''[[The Times]]'') and also U.S. newspapers, is sentence-style capitalisation in headlines, i.e. capitalisation follows the same rules that apply for sentences. This convention is usually called ''sentence case''. It may also be applied to publication titles, especially in bibliographic references and library catalogues. An example of a global publisher whose English-language house style prescribes sentence-case titles and headings is the [[International Organization for Standardization]].

For publication titles it is, however, a common typographic practice among both British&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; and U.S. publishers to capitalise significant words (and in the United States, this is often applied to headings, too). This family of typographic conventions is usually called ''title case''. For example, R.&amp;nbsp;M. Ritter's ''Oxford Manual of Style'' (2002) suggests capitalising "the first word and all nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verbs and adverbs, but generally not articles, conjunctions and short prepositions".&lt;ref name="Ritter 2002" /&gt; This is an old form of [[Emphasis (typography)|emphasis]], similar to the more modern practice of using a larger or boldface font for titles. The rules which prescribe which words to capitalise are not based on any grammatically inherent correct/incorrect distinction and are not universally standardised; they differ between style guides, although most style guides tend to follow a few strong conventions, as follows:
* Most styles capitalise all words except for short [[Closed class|closed-class]] words (certain [[Part of speech|parts of speech]], namely, articles, prepositions, and conjunctions); but the first word (always) and last word (in many styles) are also capitalised, regardless of their part of speech. Many styles capitalise longer prepositions such as "between" and "throughout", but not shorter ones such as "for" and "with".&lt;ref name="Berdine" /&gt; Typically, a preposition is considered short if it has up to three or four letters.
* A few styles capitalise all words in title case (the so-called ''start case''), which has the advantage of being easy to implement and hard to get "wrong" (that is, "not edited to style"). Because of this rule's simplicity, software [[#Case folding|case-folding]] routines can handle 95% or more of the editing, especially if they are programmed for desired exceptions (such as "FBI" rather than "Fbi").
* As for whether hyphenated words are capitalised not only at the beginning but also after the hyphen, there is no universal standard; variation occurs [[Linguistic description|in the wild]] and among house styles (e.g., "The Letter-''C''ase Rule in My Book"; "Short-''t''erm Follow-''u''p Care for Burns"). Traditional copyediting makes a distinction between ''temporary compounds'' (such as many [[Nonce word|nonce]] [novel instance] [[compound modifier]]s), in which every part of the hyphenated word is capitalised (e.g. "How This Particular Author Chose to Style His ''A''utumn-''A''pple-''P''icking Heading"), and ''permanent compounds'', which are terms that, although compound and hyphenated, are so well established that dictionaries enter them as [[headword]]s (e.g., "Short-''t''erm Follow-''u''p Care for Burns").

Title case is widely used in many English-language publications, especially in the United States. However, its conventions are sometimes not followed strictly – especially in informal writing.

In creative typography, such as music record covers and other artistic material, all styles are commonly encountered, including all-lowercase letters and special case styles, such as [[studly caps]] (see below). For example, in the [[wordmark]]s of video games it is not uncommon to use stylised upper-case letters at the beginning and end of a title, with the intermediate letters in small caps or lower case (e.g., [[Arcania: Gothic 4|{{smallcaps|ArcaniA}}]], [[ARMA: Armed Assault|{{smallcaps|ArmA}}]], and  [[DmC: Devil May Cry|DmC]]).

====Multi-word proper nouns====
Single-word [[proper nouns]] are capitalised in formal written English, unless the name is intentionally stylised to break this rule (such as the first or last name of [[danah boyd]]).

Multi-word proper nouns include names of organisations, publications, and people. Often the rules for "title case" (described in the previous section) are applied to these names, so that non-initial articles, conjunctions, and short prepositions are lowercase, and all other words are uppercase. For example, the short preposition "of" and the article "the" are lowercase in "Steering Committee of the Finance Department". Usually only capitalised words are used to form an [[acronym]] variant of the name, though there is some variation in this.

With [[personal names]], this practice can vary (sometimes all words are capitalised, regardless of length or function), but is not limited to English names. Examples include the English names [[Tamar of Georgia]] and [[Catherine the Great]], "[[van (Dutch)|van]]" and "der" in [[Dutch name]]s, "[[von]]" and "zu" in [[German name|German]], "de", "los", and "y" in [[Spanish naming customs|Spanish names]], "de" or "d'" in [[French name]]s, and "ibn" in [[Arabic name]]s.

Some surname prefixes also affect the capitalisation of the following internal letter or word, for example "Mac" in [[Surname#Celtic_compound_names|Celtic names]] and "Al" in Arabic names.

====Special case styles====
{{See also|Naming convention (programming)#Multiple-word identifiers}}
Some case styles are not used in standard English, but are common in [[computer programming]], product [[brand]]ing, or other specialised fields:

; [[Camel case]] : "TheQuickBrownFoxJumpsOverTheLazyDog"&lt;br /&gt; Spaces and [[punctuation]] are removed and the first letter of each word is capitalised. If this includes the first letter of the first word ("CamelCase", "PowerPoint", "TheQuick...", etc.), the case is sometimes called ''upper camel case'' (or, illustratively, ''CamelCase''), ''[[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] case'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/brada/archive/2004/02/03/67024.aspx|title=History around Pascal Casing and Camel Casing|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''bumpy case''. When the first letter of the first word is lowercase ("iPod", "eBay", "theQuickBrownFox..."), the case is usually known as ''lower camel case'' (illustratively: ''camelCase''). This format has become popular in the branding of [[information technology]] products and services.
; [[Snake case]] : "The_quick_brown_fox_jumps_over_the_lazy_dog"&lt;br /&gt; Punctuation is removed and spaces are replaced by single [[underscore]]s.  Normally the letters share the same case (e.g. "UPPER_CASE_EMBEDDED_UNDERSCORE" or "lower_case_embedded_underscore") but the case can be mixed, as in [[OCaml]] modules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://caml.inria.fr/resources/doc/guides/guidelines.en.html|title=Caml programming guidelines|website=caml.inria.fr|language=en|access-date=2017-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The style may also be called ''pothole case'', especially in [[Python (programming language)|Python]] programming, in which this convention is often used for naming variables. Illustratively, it may be rendered ''snake_case'', ''pothole_case'', etc.  When all-upper-case, it may be referred to as ''screaming snake case'' (or ''SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE'').&lt;ref name="Ruby" /&gt;
; [[Kebab case]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=lodash documentation |url=https://lodash.com/docs#kebabCase}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=jQuery 3.0 and jQuery Compat 3.0 Alpha Versions Released |url=http://blog.jquery.com/2015/07/13/jquery-3-0-and-jquery-compat-3-0-alpha-versions-released/}}&lt;/ref&gt; : "The-quick-brown-fox-jumps-over-the-lazy-dog"&lt;br /&gt; Similar to snake case, above, except [[hyphen]]s rather than underscores are used to replace spaces.  It is also known as ''spinal case'', ''param case'', ''[[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] case'', and ''dash case'' (or illustratively as ''kebab-case'') If every word is capitalised, the style is known as ''train case'' (''TRAIN-CASE'').{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} [[Perl6]] supports kebab case style.
; [[Studly caps]] : e.g. "tHeqUicKBrOWnFoXJUmpsoVeRThElAzydOG"&lt;br /&gt; Mixed case with no [[Semantics|semantic]] or [[Syntax|syntactic]] significance to the use of the capitals. Sometimes only [[vowel]]s are upper case, at other times upper and lower case are alternated, but often it is simply random.  The name comes from the sarcastic or ironic implication that it was used in an attempt by the writer to convey their own coolness. It is also used to mock the violation of standard English case conventions by marketers in the naming of computer software packages, even when there is no technical requirement to do so{{snd}}e.g., [[Sun Microsystems]]' naming of a windowing system [[NeWS]].  Illustrative naming of the style is, naturally, random: ''stUdlY cAps'', ''StUdLy CaPs'', etc.

===Unit symbols in the metric system===
[[File:SI base unit.svg|thumb|Of the seven [[SI base unit|SI base-unit]] symbols, "A" ([[ampere]] for [[electric current]]) and "K" ([[kelvin]] for [[temperature]]) are always written in upper case, whereas "s" ([[second]] for [[time]]), "m" ([[metre]] for [[length]]), "kg" ([[kilogram]] for [[mass]]), "cd" ([[candela]] for [[luminous intensity]]), and "mol" ([[Mole (unit)|mole]] for [[amount of substance]]) are written in lower case. (The kelvin, second and kilogram are defined independently of any other units, but the rest depend on the definitions of other base units.)]]

In the [[International System of Units]] (SI), a letter usually has different meanings in upper and lower case when used as a unit symbol. Generally, unit symbols are written in lower case, but if the name of the unit is derived from a proper noun, the first letter of the symbol is capitalised (nevertheless, the ''name'' of the unit, if spelled out, is always considered a common noun and written accordingly):&lt;ref name="SI brochure" /&gt;

* 1 s (one [[second]]) when used for the [[SI base unit|base unit]] of [[time]].
* 1 S (one [[siemens (unit)|siemens]]) when used for the unit of [[electric conductance]] and [[admittance]] (named after [[Werner von Siemens]]).
* 1 Sv (one [[sievert]]), used for the unit of [[ionising radiation]] dose (named after [[Rolf Maximilian Sievert]]).

For the purpose of clarity, the symbol for [[litre]] can optionally be written in upper case even though the name is not derived from a proper noun:&lt;ref name="SI brochure" /&gt;

* 1 l, the original form, for typefaces in which "digit one" {{angbr|1}}, "lower-case ell" {{angbr|l}}, and "upper-case eye" {{angbr|I}} look different.
* 1 L, an alternative form, for typefaces in which these characters are difficult to distinguish, or the typeface the reader will be using is unknown. A "[[ℓ|script l]]" in various typefaces (e.g.: 1&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-family: cursive;"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;) has traditionally been used in some countries to prevent confusion; however the separate [[Unicode character]], {{Unichar|2113|SCRIPT SMALL L}} (numeric character entity &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;#8467;&lt;/code&gt;), which represents this is deprecated by the [[International System of Units|SI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/charts/beta/nameslist/n_2100.html|title=Letterlike symbols|work=Charts (Beta)|publisher=[[Unicode Consortium]]|accessdate=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another solution sometimes seen in [[Web typography]] is to use a serif font for "lower-case ell" in otherwise sans-serif material (1&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-family: serif;"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;).

The letter case of a prefix symbol is determined independently of the unit symbol to which it is attached. Lower case is used for all submultiple prefix symbols and the small multiple prefix symbols up to "k" (for [[kilo-|kilo]], meaning 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 1000 multiplier), whereas upper case is used for larger multipliers:&lt;ref name="SI brochure" /&gt;

* 1 ms, a small measure of time ("m" for [[milli-|milli]], meaning 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; = 1/1000 multiplier).
* 1 Ms, a large measure of time ("M" for [[mega-|mega]], meaning 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; = 1&amp;nbsp;000&amp;nbsp;000 multiplier).
* 1 mS, a small measure of electric conductance.
* 1 MS, a large measure of electric conductance.
* 1&amp;nbsp;mm, a small measure of [[length]] (the latter "m" for [[metre]]).
* 1 Mm, a large measure of length.

=={{Anchor | Case folding}}Case folding and case conversion==
In the [[character set]]s developed for [[computing]], each upper- and lower-case letter is encoded as a separate character. In order to enable case folding and case conversion, the [[software]] needs to link together the two characters representing the case variants of a letter. (Some old character-encoding systems, such as the [[Baudot code]], are restricted to one set of letters, usually represented by the upper-case variants.)

[[Case sensitivity|Case-insensitive]] operations can be said to fold case, from the idea of folding the character code table so that upper- and lower-case letters coincide. The conversion of letter case in a [[String (computer science)|string]] is common practice in computer applications, for instance to make case-insensitive comparisons. Many high-level programming languages provide simple methods for case conversion, at least for the [[ASCII]] character set.

Whether or not the case variants are treated as equivalent to each other varies depending on the computer system and context. For example, user [[password]]s are generally case sensitive in order to allow more diversity and make them more difficult to break. On the other hand, when performing a [[keyword search]], differentiating between the upper and lower case might narrow down the search result too much.

===Unicode case folding and script identification===
[[Unicode]] defines case folding through the three case-mapping properties of each [[Character (computing)|character]]: upper case, lower case, and title case (in this context, "title case" relates to [[Typographic ligature|ligature]]s and [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s encoded as mixed-case [[Digraph (orthography)#In Unicode|single characters]], in which the first component is in upper case and the second component in lower case&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://unicode.org/faq/casemap_charprop.html#4 | title = Character Properties, Case Mappings &amp; Names FAQ | publisher = Unicode | access-date = 19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;). These properties relate all characters in scripts with differing cases to the other case variants of the character.

As briefly discussed in [[Unicode]] Technical Note #26,&lt;ref name="Unicode" /&gt; "In terms of implementation issues, any attempt at a unification of Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic would wreak havoc [and] make casing operations an unholy mess, in effect making all casing operations context sensitive […]". In other words, while the shapes of letters like '''A''', '''B''', '''E''', '''H''', '''K''', '''M''', '''O''', '''P''', '''T''', '''X''', '''Y''' and so on are shared between the Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic alphabets (and small differences in their canonical forms may be considered to be of a merely [[Typography|typographical]] nature), it would still be problematic for a multilingual [[character set]] or a [[font]] to provide only a ''single'' [[code point]] for, say, uppercase letter '''B''', as this would make it quite difficult for a wordprocessor to change that single uppercase letter to one of the three different choices for the lower-case letter, the Latin '''b''' (U+0062), Greek '''β''' (U+03B2) or Cyrillic '''в''' (U+0432). Therefore, the corresponding Latin, Greek and Cyrillic upper-case letters (U+0042, U+0392 and U+0412, respectively) are also encoded as separate characters, despite their appearance being basically identical. Without letter case, a "unified European alphabet"{{spaced ndash}}such as '''ABБCГDΔΕЄЗFΦGHIИJ'''…'''Z''', with an appropriate subset for each language{{spaced ndash}}is feasible; but considering letter case, it becomes very clear that these alphabets are rather distinct sets of symbols.

===Methods in word processing===
Most modern [[word processor]]s provide automated case conversion with a simple click or keystroke. For example, in Microsoft Office Word, there is a dialog box for toggling the selected text through UPPERCASE, then lowercase, then Title Case (actually start caps; exception words must be lowercased individually). The keystroke {{keypress|shift|F3}} does the same thing.

===Methods in programming===
In some forms of [[BASIC]] there are two methods for case conversion:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="qbasic"&gt;
 UpperA$ = UCASE$("a")
 LowerA$ = LCASE$("A")
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

[[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]], as well as any C-like language that conforms to its [[C standard library|standard library]], provide these functions in the file [[ctype.h]]:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="c"&gt;
 char upperA = toupper('a');
 char lowerA = tolower('A');
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Case conversion is different with different [[character sets]]. In [[ASCII]] or [[EBCDIC]], case can be converted in the following way, in C:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="c"&gt;
 #define toupper(c) (islower(c) ? (c) – 'a' + 'A' : (c))
 #define tolower(c) (isupper(c) ? (c) – 'A' + 'a' : (c))
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
This only works because the letters of upper and lower cases are spaced out equally. In ASCII they are consecutive, whereas with EBCDIC they are not; nonetheless the upper-case letters are arranged in the same pattern and with the same gaps as are the lower-case letters, so the technique still works.

Some computer programming languages offer facilities for converting text to a form in which all words are capitalised.  [[Visual Basic]] calls this "proper case"; [[Python (programming language)|Python]] calls it "title case".  This differs from usual [[Capitalization#Sentence case versus title case|title casing]] conventions, such as the English convention in which minor words are not capitalised.

Originally [[alphabet]]s were written entirely in majuscule letters, spaced between well-defined upper and lower bounds. When written quickly with a [[pen]], these tended to turn into rounder and much simpler forms. It is from these that the first minuscule hands developed, the [[half-uncial]]s and cursive minuscule, which no longer stayed bound between a pair of lines.&lt;ref name="Harris 2003" /&gt; These in turn formed the foundations for the [[Carolingian minuscule]] script, developed by [[Alcuin]] for use in the court of [[Charlemagne]], which quickly spread across Europe. The advantage of the minuscule over majuscule was improved, faster readability.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

In [[Latin]], [[Papyrus|papyri]] from [[Herculaneum]] dating before 79 CE (when it was destroyed) have been found that have been written in old [[Roman cursive]], where the early forms of minuscule letters "d", "h" and "r", for example, can already be recognised. According to papyrologist [[Knut Kleve]], "The theory, then, that the lower-case letters have been developed from the fifth century [[uncial]]s and the ninth century Carolingian minuscules seems to be wrong."&lt;ref name="Kleve 1994" /&gt; Both majuscule and minuscule letters existed, but the difference between the two variants was initially stylistic rather than orthographic and the writing system was still basically unicameral: a given handwritten document could use either one style or the other but these were not mixed. European languages, except for [[Ancient Greek]] and Latin, did not make the case distinction before about 1300.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

The timeline of writing in Western Europe can be divided into four eras:{{fact|date=October 2017}}
*Greek majuscule (9th–3rd century BCE) in contrast to the Greek [[uncial script]] (3rd century BCE&amp;nbsp;– 12th century CE) and the later Greek minuscule
*[[Roman square capitals|Roman majuscule]] (7th century BCE&amp;nbsp;– 4th century CE) in contrast to the Roman uncial (4th–8th century CE), [[Roman Half Uncial]], and minuscule
*[[Carolingian]] majuscule (4th–8th century CE) in contrast to the [[Carolingian minuscule]] (around 780&amp;nbsp;– 12th century)
*[[Blackletter|Gothic]] majuscule (13th and 14th century), in contrast to the early Gothic (end of 11th to 13th century), Gothic (14th century), and late Gothic (16th century) minuscules.

Traditionally, certain letters were rendered differently according to a set of rules.  In particular, those letters that began sentences or nouns were made larger and often written in a distinct script. There was no fixed capitalisation system until the early [[18th century]]. The [[English language]] eventually dropped the rule for nouns, while the German language keeps it.

Similar developments have taken place in other alphabets. The lower-case script for the [[Greek alphabet]] has its origins in the 7th century and acquired its quadrilinear form in the 8th century. Over time, uncial letter forms were increasingly mixed into the script. The earliest dated Greek lower-case text is the [[Uspenski Gospels]] (MS 461) in the year 835.&lt;ref&gt;The earliest known biblical manuscript is a palimpsest of Isajah in Syriac, written in 459/460. [[Bruce M. Metzger]] &amp; [[Bart D. Ehrman]], ''The Text of the New Testament'' ([[Oxford University Press]]: 2005), p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; The modern practice of capitalising the first letter of every sentence seems to be imported (and is rarely used when printing Ancient Greek materials even today).{{fact|date=October 2017}}

[[File:Evolution of minuscule.svg|thumb|center|700px
|Simplified relationship between various scripts leading to the development of modern lower case of standard Latin alphabet and that of the modern variants [[Fraktur (script)|Fraktur]] (used, until recently, in Germany) and [[Gaelic type|Gaelic]] (used in Ireland). Several scripts coexisted such as [[half-uncial]] and [[uncial]], which derive from [[Roman cursive]] and [[Greek uncial]], and [[Visigothic script|Visigothic]], [[Merovingian script|Merovingian (Luxeuil variant here)]] and [[Beneventan script|Beneventan]].  The [[Carolingian script]] was the basis for [[blackletter]] and [[humanist minuscule]]. What is commonly called "Gothic writing" is technically called blackletter (here [[Textualis|textualis quadrata]]) and is completely unrelated to Visigothic script.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;!--
 --&gt;The letter j is i with a [[Swash (typography)|flourish]], u and v are the same letter in early scripts and were used depending on their position in insular half-uncial and caroline minuscule and later scripts, w is a ligature of vv, in insular the [[rune]] [[wynn]] is used as a w (three other runes in use were the [[Thorn (letter)|thorn]] (þ), ʻféʼ (ᚠ) as an abbreviation for cattle/goods and maðr (ᛘ) for man).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;!--
 --&gt;The letters y and z were very rarely used, in particular þ was written identically to y so y was dotted to avoid confusion, the dot was adopted for i only after late-caroline (protogothic), in beneventan script the [[Scribal abbreviation|macron abbreviation]] featured a dot above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;!--
 --&gt;Lost variants such as [[r rotunda]], ligatures and [[Scribal abbreviation|scribal abbreviation marks]] are omitted, [[long s]] is shown when no terminal s (surviving variant) is present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;!--
 --&gt;[[Humanist sans-serif|Humanist script]] was the basis for Venetian [[Typeface|types]] which changed little until today, such as [[Times Roman|Times New Roman]] ([[Serif|a serifed typeface]]).

===Type cases===
The individual type blocks used in hand [[typesetting]] are stored in shallow wooden or metal drawers known as "[[type case]]s". Each is subdivided into a number of compartments ("boxes") for the storage of different individual letters.{{fact|date=October 2017}}

The ''Oxford Universal Dictionary on Historical Advanced Proportional Principles'' (reprinted 1952) indicates that ''case'' in this sense (referring to the box or frame used by a compositor in the printing trade) was first used in English in 1588. Originally one large case was used for each typeface, then "divided cases", pairs of cases for majuscules and minuscules, were introduced in the region of today's Belgium by 1563, England by 1588, and France before 1723.

The terms ''upper'' and ''lower'' case originate from this division. By convention, when the two cases were taken out of the storage rack, and placed on a rack on the [[Compositor (typesetting)|compositor]]'s desk, the case containing the capitals and small capitals stood at a steeper angle at the back of the desk, with the case for the small letters, punctuation and spaces being more easily reached at a shallower angle below it to the front of the desk, hence upper and lower case.&lt;ref name="Bolton 1997" /&gt;

Though pairs of cases were used in English-speaking countries and many European countries in the seventeenth century, in Germany and Scandinavia the single case continued in use.&lt;ref name="Bolton 1997" /&gt;

Various patterns of cases are available, often with the compartments for lower-case letters varying in size according to the frequency of use of letters, so that the commonest letters are grouped together in larger boxes at the centre of the case.&lt;ref name="Bolton 1997" /&gt; The compositor takes the letter blocks from the compartments and places them in a [[composing stick]], working from left to right and placing the letters upside down with the nick to the top, then sets the assembled type in a [[Galley proof|galley]].&lt;ref name="Bolton 1997" /&gt;

'''Lower Nossob''' an extinct [[Khoisan language]] once spoken along the [[Nossob River]] on the border of South Africa and Botswana, near Namibia. It was closely related to [[Taa language|Taa]]. 

There are two attested dialects: ǀ’Auni (ǀ’Auo), recorded by [[Dorothea Bleek]], and ǀHaasi, recorded by Robert Story.  ǀ’Auni is the word the former use for themselves; ǀ’Auo (or ǀ’Au) is what they call their language.  ''ǀauni, ǁauni, Auni'' are misspellings.  Other renderings of the name ǀHaasi are ''K’uǀha:si, Kiǀhasi,'' and ''Kiǀhazi.''&lt;ref&gt;Yvonne Treis, 1998, "Names of Khoisan Languages and their Variants"&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Modularity''' refers to the ability of a [[system]] to organize discrete, individual units that can overall increase the efficiency of network activity and, in a [[biology|biological]] sense, facilitates selective forces upon the network. Modularity is observed in all model systems, and can be studied at nearly every scale of biological organization, from molecular interactions all the way up to the whole [[organism]].

==Evolution of Modularity==
The exact [[evolution]]ary origins of biological modularity has been debated since the 1990s. In the mid 1990s, [[Günter Wagner]]&lt;ref&gt;GP Wagner. 1996. "Homologues, Natural Kinds and the Evolution of Modularity". ''American Zoologist''. 36:36-43&lt;/ref&gt; argued that modularity could have arisen and been maintained through the interaction of four evolutionary modes of action:

[1] [[Natural selection|Selection]] for the rate of [[adaptation]]: If different complexes evolve at different rates, then those evolving more quickly reach fixation in a population faster than other complexes. Thus, common evolutionary rates could be forcing the [[gene]]s for certain [[protein]]s to evolve together while preventing other genes from being co-opted unless there is a shift in evolutionary rate.

[2] Constructional selection: When a gene exists in many duplicated copies, it may be maintained because of the many connections it has (also termed [[pleiotropy]]). There is evidence that this is so following whole genome duplication, or duplication at a single locus. However, the direct relationship that duplication processes have with modularity has yet to be directly examined.

[3] [[Stabilizing selection]]: While seeming antithetical to forming novel modules, Wagner maintains that it is important to consider the effects of stabilizing selection as it may be "an important counter force against the evolution of modularity". Stabilizing selection, if ubiquitously spread across the network, could then be a "wall" that makes the formation of novel interactions more difficult and maintains previously established interactions. Against such strong positive selection, other evolutionary forces acting on the network must exist, with gaps of relaxed selection, to allow focused reorganization to occur.

[4] Compounded effect of stabilizing and [[directional selection]]: This is the explanation seemingly favored by Wagner and his contemporaries as it provides a model through which modularity is constricted, but still able to unidirectionally explore different evolutionary outcomes. The semi-antagonistic relationship is best illustrated using the corridor model, whereby stabilizing selection forms barriers in ''[[phenotype]] space'' that only allow the system to move towards the ''optimum'' along a single path. This allows directional selection to act and inch the system closer to optimum through this evolutionary corridor.

For over a decade, researchers examined the dynamics of selection on network modularity. However, in 2013 Clune and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;J Clune, JB Mouret, and H Lipson. 2013. "The evolutionary origins of modularity". ''Proceedings of the Royal Society B''. 280: 20122863.&lt;/ref&gt; challenged the sole focus on selective forces, and instead provided evidence that there are inherent "connectivity costs" that limit the number of connections between nodes to maximize efficiency of transmission. This hypothesis originated from neurological studies that found that there is an inverse relationship between the number of neural connections and the overall efficiency (more connections seemed to limit the overall performance speed/precision of the network). This connectivity cost had yet to be applied to evolutionary analyses. Clune et al. created a series of models that compared the efficiency of various ''evolved'' network topologies in an environment where performance, their only metric for selection, was taken into account, and another treatment where performance as well as the connectivity cost were factored together. The results show not only that modularity formed ubiquitously in the models that factored in connection cost, but that these models also outperformed the performance-only based counterparts in every task. This suggests a potential model for module evolution whereby modules form from a system’s tendency to resist maximizing connections to create more efficient and compartmentalized network topologies.

The '''Moken language''' is a half dozen closely related varieties spoken by the [[Moken]] "[[Moken people|Sea Gypsies]]" off the coast of Burma and Thailand. It is divergent from other [[Malayo-Sumbawan languages]], and has been strongly influenced by [[Mon–Khmer languages]].&lt;ref&gt;Larish, Michael David. 1999. The Position of Moken and Moklen Within the Austronesian Language Family. Doctoral dissertation, University of Hawai'i at Mānoa.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dialects==
The Moken or '''Moklen–Moken''' dialects are typically divided into two languages, ''Moken'' and ''Moklen'', corresponding to the two varieties spoken in Thai waters.  However, Moklen is just one of half a dozen Moken dialects, most of which are spoken in Burma (Naw Say Bay 1995).  The Burmese varieties have not been adequately investigated, but from north to south the known dialects are:

*Dung (635 speakers&lt;ref name="NawSayBay2015"&gt;Naw Say Bay. 2015. The process of preserving Moken from extinction. Paper presented at SoLE-4, Payap University.&lt;/ref&gt;)
*Jait (331 speakers&lt;ref name="NawSayBay2015"/&gt;)
*Lebi, L'be (980 speakers&lt;ref name="NawSayBay2015"/&gt;)
*Niawi
*Jadiak
*Moklen

Dung through Niawi are spoken (mostly) in Burma, Jadiak and Moklen mostly in Thailand.  (Jadiak is also spoken in a second area to the south of Moklen.)

==Classification==
Moken is often classified in a group with the other Malayo-Polynesian languages of Southeast Asia, [[Chamic languages|Chamic]] and [[Malayic languages|Malayic]], but Larish (2005) concludes that they do not belong together.  Another language spoken by Sea Gypsies of the same islands, [[Urak Lawoi’ language|Urak Lawoi’]], is one of the Malayic languages.

'''MySpell''' is a [[spell checker]] that was formerly included with [[OpenOffice.org Writer|OOo Writer]] of the [[free software|free]] [[OpenOffice.org]] [[office suite]].

Since version 2.0.2, OpenOffice.org has replaced MySpell with [[Hunspell]].

==Background==
MySpell was started by [[Kevin Hendricks]] in an attempt to integrate various open-source spelling checkers into the [[OpenOffice.org]] build. With a little prodding from [[Kevin Atkinson (programmer)|Kevin Atkinson]], the author of [[Pspell]] and [[Aspell]], a new spelling checker (MySpell) was written in [[C++]] that supported affix compression, based on [[Ispell]].

==Locale (language) files==
Every [[Locale (computer software)|locale]] (language for a specific territory) can have files for spelling, hyphenation and a thesaurus. These files will be all found together in one folder. The spell checking is done using the .aff file for the locale together with the .dic file. The .dic file is a list of words along with a group of letters which refer to the [[affixes]] found in the .aff file.  This saves space because instead of having to include all forms of a word, like jump (jumping, jumps, jumped), the .dic file will include the word once and the references to the affixes in the .aff file allow the construction of all the other forms.

It is not enough to copy the files for a locale into the folder.  As there are multiple locales, automatic loading of all dictionaries would cause a considerable overhead.  Hence only those locales listed in dictionary.lst are accessible.  dictionary.lst can be edited with a simple text editor, but front ends provide a more user-friendly way of adding new locales.

==MySpell with other programs==
MySpell is currently used by other programs:
*[[AbiWord]]
*[[Aegisub]] 2.0 can use a dictionary created for MySpell by adding AFF and DIC files to the Dictionary folder.
*[[STAR Transit NXT]], a [[Computer-assisted translation|CAT]] suite from the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] firm [[STAR AG]], can optionally use MySpell dictionaries for spell-checking.
Aspell and [[Vim (text editor)|Vim]] 7 can now use a dictionary created for MySpell.

'''Na-Dene''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|n|ɑː|d|ᵻ|ˈ|n|eɪ}}; also '''Nadene''', '''Na-Dené''', '''Athabaskan–Eyak–Tlingit''', '''Tlina–Dene''') is a [[language family|family]] of [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Native American languages]] that includes at least the [[Athabaskan languages]], [[Eyak language|Eyak]], and [[Tlingit language|Tlingit]] languages.  An old inclusion of [[Haida language|Haida]] is now considered doubtful.

In February 2008, a proposal connecting Na-Dene (excluding Haida) to the [[Yeniseian languages]] of central [[Siberia]] into a [[Dené–Yeniseian languages|Dené–Yeniseian]] family was published and well-received by a number of linguists.&lt;ref name=DYS&gt;[http://www.uaf.edu/anlc/dy/dy2008/ Dene–Yeniseic Symposium], University of Alaska Fairbanks, February 2008, accessed 30 Mar 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It was proposed in a 2014 paper that the Na-Dene languages of North America and the Yeniseian languages of Siberia had a common origin in a language spoken in [[Beringia]], between the two continents.&lt;ref&gt;Mark A. Sicoli and Gary Holton, [http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0091722 Linguistic Phylogenies Support Back-Migration from Beringia to Asia], PLoS ONE, March 12, 2014, accessed November 25, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
[[Edward Sapir]] originally constructed the term ''Na-Dene'' to refer to a combined family of Athabaskan, Tlingit, and Haida (the existence of the [[Eyak language]] was not known to him at the time). In his "The Na-Dene languages: A preliminary report", he describes how he arrived at the term (Sapir 1915, p.&amp;nbsp;558):
{{Quote|The name that I have chosen for the stock, ''Na-dene'', may be justified by reference to no. 51 of the comparative vocabulary. ''Dene'', in various dialectic forms, is a wide-spread Athabaskan term for "person, people"; the element ''*-ne'' (''*-n'', ''*-η'') which forms part of it is an old stem for "person, people" which, as suffix or prefix, is frequently used in Athabaskan in that sense. It is cognate with H. ''na'' "to dwell; house" and Tl. ''na'' "people". The compound term ''Na-dene'' thus designates by means of native stems the speakers of the three languages concerned, besides continuing the use of the old term ''Dene'' for the Athabaskan branch of the stock.}}

== Family division ==
In its non-controversial core, Na-Dene consists of two branches, Tlingit and Athabaskan–Eyak:
* [[Tlingit language|Tlingit]]: 700 speakers ([[Michael E. Krauss|Michael Krauss]], 1995)
* Athabaskan–Eyak
** [[Eyak language|Eyak]]: extinct in 2008
** [[Athabaskan languages|Athabaskan]]
*** [[Northern Athabaskan languages|Northern]]
*** [[Pacific Coast Athabaskan languages|Pacific Coast]]
*** [[Southern Athabaskan languages|Southern]]

For linguists who follow [[Edward Sapir]] in connecting Haida to the above languages, Haida represents an additional branch, with Athabaskan–Eyak–Tlingit together forming the other. [[Dene]] or Dine (the Athabaskan languages) is a widely distributed group of Native languages spoken by associated peoples in [[Alberta]], [[British Columbia]], [[Manitoba]], [[Northwest Territories]], [[Nunavut]], [[Saskatchewan]], [[Yukon]], [[Alaska]], parts of [[Oregon]], northern [[California]], and the [[American Southwest]] as far as northern [[Mexico]].

The southwestern division of Athabaskan is also called Southern Athabaskan or [[Apachean]], and includes [[Navajo language|Navajo]] and all the [[Apache]] dialects. [[Eyak]] was spoken in south-central Alaska; the last speaker died in 2008.  [[Navajo language|Navajo]] is by far the most widely spoken language of the Na-Dene family, spoken in [[Arizona]], [[New Mexico]], and other regions of the American Southwest.

==Typological profile of Athabaskan–Eyak–Tlingit==
All of these languages share a highly complex prefixing verb structure in which tense and mood markers are interdigitated between subject and object agreement markers.  The morphological hallmark of the family is a series of prefixes found directly before the verb root that raise or lower the transitivity of the verb word. These prefixes, traditionally known as "classifiers", derive historically from a combination of three distinct classes of morphemes and are not found in any other Native American language family.

The phoneme system contains a large number of dorsal (velar or uvular) consonants (fronting in many modern Athabaskan languages to palatals and velars, correspondingly) as well as a general absence of labial obstruents (except where /b/ has arisen from *w). In the historical phonology there is a widespread tendency, observable across many Athabaskan languages, for phonemic tonal distinctions to arise from glottal features originally found at the end of the syllable. The glottal features in question are often evident in Eyak or Tlingit. These languages are typologically unusual in containing extensive prefixation yet being SOV and postpositional, features normally associated with suffixing languages.

==Proposals of deeper genealogical relations involving Athabaskan–Eyak–Tlingit==
A genealogical connection between the Tlingit, Eyak and Athabaskan languages was suggested early in the 19th century, but not universally accepted until much later. [[Haida language|Haida]], with 15 fluent speakers (M. Krauss, 1995), was originally linked to Tlingit by [[Franz Boas]] in 1894. Both Haida and Tlingit were then connected to Athabaskan by Edward Sapir in 1915. Linguists such as [[Lyle Campbell]] (1997) today consider the evidence inconclusive.  They have classified Haida as a [[language isolate]]. In order to emphasise the exclusion of Haida, Campbell refers to the language family as ''Athabaskan–Eyak–Tlingit'' rather than ''Na-Dene''. In 2010 Jeff Leer published extensive primary materials on what he calls ''PAET'' (Proto-Athabascan–Eyak–Tlingit).

===Dené–Yeniseian===
{{Main|Dené–Yeniseian languages}}
In 2008, [[Edward Vajda]] of [[Western Washington University]] presented evidence suggesting that the Na-Dene languages (Athabaskan–Eyak–Tlingit) might be related to the [[Yeniseian languages|Yeniseian]] (or Yeniseic) languages of [[Siberia]],&lt;ref name="vajd08b"&gt;See [[#vajd08b|Vajda 2010]]&lt;/ref&gt; the only living representative of which is the [[Ket language]].

Key evidence by current comparative methodologies includes homologies in verb prefixes and also a systematic correspondence between the distribution of Ket tones and consonant articulations found in Athabaskan–Eyak–Tlingit. Vajda's paper has been favorably reviewed by several experts on Na-Dene and Yeniseic languages, including [[Michael E. Krauss|Michael Krauss]], Jeff Leer, [[James Kari]], and Heinrich Werner, as well as a number of other well-known linguists, including [[Bernard Comrie]], [[Johanna Nichols]], Victor Golla, [[Michael Fortescue]], and [[Eric P. Hamp|Eric Hamp]]. The conclusion of this seminar was that the comparison with Yeniseic data shows that Haida cannot be classified in a genealogical unit with Athabaskan–Eyak–Tlingit.&lt;ref name=DYS/&gt;

===Other proposals===
According to [[Joseph Greenberg]]'s controversial classification of the languages of Native North America, Na-Dené (including Haida) is one of the three main groups of Native languages spoken in the Americas. Contemporary supporters of Greenberg's theory, such as [[Merritt Ruhlen]], have suggested that the Na-Dené language family represents a distinct migration of people from [[Asia]] into the New World that occurred six to eight thousand years ago, placing it around four thousand years later than the previous migration into the Americas by Amerind speakers; this remains an unproven hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/12/science/earliest-americans-arrived-in-3-waves-not-1-dna-study-finds.html |title=Earliest Americans arrived in 3&amp;nbsp;waves, not&amp;nbsp;1, DNA study finds |first=Nicholas |last=Wade |date=11 July 2012 |publisher=[[New York Times]] |access-date=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Ruhlen speculates that the Na-Dené speakers may have arrived in boats, initially settling near the [[Haida Gwaii]], now in [[British Columbia]], Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.centerfirstamericans.com/mt.html/?a=6Na |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161120212958/http://www.centerfirstamericans.com/mt.html/?a=6Na |archive-date=2016-11-20 |title=Center for the Study of the First Americans |department=Anthropology |publisher=Texas A&amp;M University |year=2011-05-15 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Linguist [[Edward Sapir]] suggested that the [[Sino-Tibetan languages]] are related to Na-Dené.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Campbell, Lyle |year=1997 |title=American Indian Languages: The Historical Linguistics of Native America |location=Oxford, UK |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent hypotheses, e.g. by [[Sergei Starostin]], suggest that Na-Dené (including Haida) may belong to the much broader [[Dené–Caucasian languages|Dené–Caucasian]] superfamily, which also contains the [[North Caucasian languages]], [[Sino-Tibetan languages]], and [[Yeniseian languages]].

Notes:
#PAET, PAE and PA stand for Proto-Athabaskan–Eyak–Tlingit, Proto-Athabaskan–Eyak and Proto-Athabaskan, respectively.
#To prevent cluttering the table, phonemes in the PAET, PAE and PA columns are not asterisked.
#Leer (2008, 2010) doesn't reconstruct the PAET affricates */dɮ/, */tɬ/ and */dz/. Judging from their rarity, he assumes they may be attributable to the resolution of former consonant clusters.
#In Athabaskan and Eyak, sibilants can be diminutive variants of shibilants. In Tlingit, on the other hand, shibilants might sometimes be diminutive variants of sibilants. These correspondences are in parentheses.

'''Nathan U. Salmon''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|æ|m|ən}}; né '''Nathan Salmon Ucuzoglu''' in 1951) is an [[United States|American]]  philosopher in the [[Analytic philosophy|analytic]] tradition, specializing in [[metaphysics]], [[philosophy of language]], and [[philosophy of logic]].

== Life and career ==
Salmon was born January 2, 1951 in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] to a working-class family of [[Sephardi Jews]] of [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews|Spanish]]-[[Turkish people|Turkish]] heritage. He is the grandson of archivist Emily Sene (née Emily Perez) and [[oud]] player Isaac Sene. Salmon attended Lincoln Elementary School in [[Torrance, California|Torrance]], California through eighth grade, where he was a classmate and friend of the [[child prodigy]], [[James Newton Howard]]. Salmon graduated from [[North High School (Torrance)]] in 1969.
 
The first person in his family to go to college, Salmon graduated from [[El Camino College]] (1971) and from the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (B.A. 1973, M.A. 1974, [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] 1979). At [[UCLA Department of Philosophy|UCLA]] he studied with [[Tyler Burge]], [[Alonzo Church]], [[Keith Donnellan]], [[Donald Kalish]], [[David Kaplan (philosopher)|David Kaplan]], [[Saul Kripke]], and [[Yiannis Moschovakis]]. Salmon was assistant professor of [[philosophy]] at [[Princeton University]] from 1978 to 1982. In 1984, the [http://www.cgsnet.org/Default.aspx?tabid=104 Council of Graduate Schools] awarded him the [http://www.cgsnet.org/cgs-gustave-o-arlt-award-humanities Gustave O. Arlt Award in the Humanities], for his book, ''Reference and Essence'' (1981), which was based on his UCLA doctoral dissertation. His second book, ''Frege's Puzzle'' (1986), was selected by [[Scott Soames]] for a literary website as one of the best five books on the philosophy of language.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Soames, "Best Five Books on the Philosophy of Language," ''The Browser'', October 15, 2010. The other selections are monographs by [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Gottlob Frege]], [[David Kaplan (philosopher)|David Kaplan]], and [[Saul Kripke]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Salmon is currently Distinguished Professor of philosophy at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], and has been teaching there since 1984. He has also taught at UCLA, the [[University of California, Riverside]], the [[University of Southern California]], and was a regular visiting distinguished professor at the [[Graduate Center|City University of New York Graduate Center]] from 2009 to 2012.

== Philosophical work ==
===Direct reference theory===&lt;!-- "Millianism" redirects here --&gt;
Salmon is a proponent of the theory of [[direct reference]]. Salmon has provided accounts both of [[propositional attitude]]s and of [[Frege's Puzzle|Frege's puzzle]] about true identifications, i.e., truths of the form "''a'' = ''b''".&lt;ref&gt;In his books, ''Frege's Puzzle'' and ''Content, [[Cognition]], and [[Communication]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Salmon maintains that co-designative proper names are inter-substitutable with preservation of [[semantic]] content. Thus, on his view the sentence "Samuel Clemens was witty" expresses exactly the same content as "Mark Twain was witty", whether or not the competent user of these sentences recognizes it. Therefore, a person who believes that [[Mark Twain]] was witty ''ipso facto'' believes that [[Samuel Clemens]] was witty, even if he or she also believes, inconsistently, that Clemens was not witty. Salmon argues that this is made palatable by recognizing that to believe a proposition is to be cognitively disposed in a particular manner toward that proposition when taking it by means of some ''proposition-guise'' or other, and that one may be so disposed relative to one proposition-guise while not being so disposed relative to another. Salmon applies this apparatus to solve a variety of famous philosophical puzzles, including Frege's puzzle, Kripke's puzzle about so-called ''de dicto'' belief, and [[W. V. O. Quine]]'s puzzle about ''de re'' belief. For example, Quine describes a scenario in which Ralph believes that Ortcutt is no spy, yet Ralph also believes that the man in the brown hat is a spy, when unbeknownst to Ralph the man in the hat is none other than Ortcutt. Under these circumstances, is Ortcutt believed by Ralph to be a spy? The grounds for an affirmative or negative judgment seem equally balanced. On Salmon's account Ortcutt is believed by Ralph to be a spy, since Ralph is appropriately cognitively disposed toward the proposition about Ortcutt that he is a spy when taking that proposition by means of one proposition-guise, even though Ralph is not so disposed relative to an alternative, equally relevant proposition-guise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/prop-attitude-reports/#FrePuz. "Propositional Attitude Reports"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Existence===
Salmon provided direct-reference accounts of problems of [[nonexistence]] and of names from fiction.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''Metaphysics, Mathematics, and Meaning'', Oxford University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Salmon argues, directly contrary to [[Immanuel Kant]],&lt;ref&gt;''[http://humanum.arts.cuhk.edu.hk/Philosophy/Kant/cpr/ Critique of Pure Reason] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707011421/http://humanum.arts.cuhk.edu.hk/Philosophy/Kant/cpr/ |date=2009-07-07 }}'' book II c.3 sec. 5, [http://humanum.arts.cuhk.edu.hk/cgi-bin/cprframe.pl?query=18ideal.htm,A598  A598, B626].&lt;/ref&gt; that [[existence]] is a property, one that particular individuals have and other individuals lack. According to Salmon, the English verb "exist" is (along with its literal translations into other languages), among other things, a term for this alleged property, and a sentence of the form "''a'' exists" is true if and only if the subject term designates something with the property, and is false (and "''a'' does not exist" is true) if and only if the subject term designates something with the complementary property of nonexistence. Thus [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]]'s example, "The present king of France exists", is neither true nor false, since France is not presently a monarchy, and therefore "the present king of France" does not designate; whereas "Napoleon exists" is simply false, since although [[Napoleon]] once existed, the moment he died he took on the property of nonexistence.

By contrast, Salmon maintains that "Sherlock Holmes exists" is literally true, whereas "Sherlock Holmes was a detective" is literally false. According to Salmon, [[Sherlock Holmes]] is a fictional character, a kind of [[abstract entity]], created by author [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], and the fiction is a story, or a collection of stories, which are about that very character but are literally false. Holmes really exists, but is only depicted as a detective in the fiction. In the fiction, Holmes is a detective; in reality, Holmes is merely a fictional detective.

Salmon extends this view to what he calls ''mythical objects'', like the hypothetical planet, [[Vulcan (hypothetical planet)|Vulcan]]. Vulcan really exists, but it is not a real planet. It is an abstract entity that is only depicted as a planet in the myth. Salmon's account of fiction and myth thus has direct application to the philosophy of religion. Salmon has also applied his account of mythical objects to [[Peter Geach]]'s famous problem of uncovering the [[logical form]] of the particular sentence, "Hob thinks a witch has blighted Bob's mare, and Nob wonders whether she (the same witch) killed Cob's sow". Salmon's account shows how the problematic sentence can be true even though there are no witches, and even if Hob and Nob do not know about each other, and there is no one whom they think is a witch.

Salmon thinks, again contrary to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], that it is perfectly legitimate to invoke existence in a term's definition. Thus "God" might be legitimately defined as ''the conceivable individual that is divine and also exists''. According to Salmon, the [[ontological argument]] for God's existence fallaciously assumes that "The ''F'' is ''F''" is a truth of [[logic]], or an [[logical truth|analytic truth]]. What is true by logic is a significantly weaker variant: "If anything is uniquely ''F'', then the ''F'' is ''F''". The strongest conclusion that [[Validity (logic)|validly]] follows from the proposed definition is that ''if'' any conceivable individual actually is uniquely both divine and existent, ''then'' God actually exists. This same conclusion is also a trivial [[logical consequence]] of the [[atheism|atheist]]'s contention that no conceivable individual actually is uniquely both divine and existent. According to Salmon's critique, the ontological argument thus shows nothing.

=== Semantics and pragmatics===
Salmon argues that natural-language sentences that are representable as λ-converts of one another (in the sense of Church's [[lambda-calculus]]) are, although [[Logical equivalence|logically equivalent]] by λ-conversion, typically not strictly synonymous, i.e., they typically differ in semantic content—as for example "''a'' is large and also ''a'' is seaworthy" and "''a'' is a thing that is both large and seaworthy".

Salmon maintains a sharp division between [[semantics]] and [[pragmatics]] ([[speech acts]]). He argues that in uttering a sentence, a speaker typically asserts a good deal more than the words' semantic content, and that, consequently, it is a mistake to identify the semantic content of a sentence with what is said by its speaker. Salmon maintains that such an identification is an instance of a mistaken form of argument in the philosophy of language, "the pragmatic fallacy."&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/prop-attitude-reports/#NaiRusThe "Propositional Attitude Reports"].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Essentialism===
Salmon is also known in [[metaphysics]] for, among other things, his analysis of arguments for [[essentialism]]—the doctrine that some properties of things are properties that those things could not fail to have (except perhaps by not existing). In particular, Salmon is known for his development and defense of a ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' argument, using a [[Paradox of the heap|sorites]]-like problem ([[slippery slope]]), against nearly universally accepted [[modal logic]] systems S4 and S5, which he argues commit "the fallacy of necessity iteration," sanctioning the invalid inference from the observation that a proposition ''p'' is a [[logical truth|necessary truth]] to the conclusion that it is a necessary truth that ''p'' is a necessary truth. He defends his view by exposing a mistake in a standard argument favoring S5, while arguing that there are not only [[possible world]]s—thought of as maximal scenarios that might have obtained—but in addition classically consistent ''[[impossible world]]s'': maximal scenarios that could not obtain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/natural-kinds/#Ess "Natural Kinds"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Identity===
Salmon also provided a controversial ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' "disproof" of indeterminate [[identity (philosophy)|identity]], i.e., the philosophically popular idea that for some pairs of things there is no fact of the matter concerning whether those things are one and the very same. Salmon argues that if there were such a pair of things, ''x'' and ''y'', then this pair would have to be different from the reflexive pair of ''x'' with itself, since there is a fact concerning whether ''x'' and ''x'' are the same. It would then follow by [[set theory]] that ''x'' and ''y'' are not the same, and in that case there would be a fact of the matter after all concerning whether ''x'' and ''y'' are the same: they are not. Therefore, there cannot be a pair of things for which there is no fact concerning their identity. On the other hand, Salmon maintains that not all vagueness is due to language and some indeterminacy results from how things themselves are, i.e., that for some things and some attributes, independently of language, there is no fact of the matter concerning whether those things have those attributes. Critics of Salmon's alleged proof acknowledge that the highlighted difference between &lt;''x'', ''y''&gt; and &lt;''x'', ''x''&gt;—that there is a fact whether the elements of the latter, but not of the former, are the same thing—is genuine, but respond that it does not validly support the conclusion that those pairs are not the same.

'''Niuean''' ({{IPAc-en|nj|u|ˈ|eɪ|ə|n}};&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Bauer, 2007, ''The Linguistics Student’s Handbook'', Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang|niu|ko e vagahau Niuē}}) is a [[Polynesian languages|Polynesian]] language, belonging to the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian subgroup]] of the [[Austronesian languages]]. It is most closely related to [[Tongan language|Tongan]] and slightly more distantly to other Polynesian languages such as [[Māori language|Māori]], [[Samoan language|Sāmoan]], and [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiʻian]]. Together, Tongan and Niuean form the [[Tongic languages|Tongic]] subgroup of the Polynesian languages. Niuean also has a number of influences from Samoan and Eastern Polynesian languages.

== Speakers ==
Niuean was spoken by 1600 people on [[Niue]] Island (97.4% of the inhabitants) in 1991, as well as by speakers in the [[Cook Islands]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Tonga]], for a total of around 8,000 speakers. There are thus more speakers of Niuean outside the island itself than on the island. Most inhabitants of Niue are bilingual in [[English language|English]].

In the early 1990s 70% of the speakers of Niuean lived in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;Moseley, Christopher and R. E. Asher, ed. ''Atlas Of The World's Languages'' (New York: Routelage, 1994) p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dialects ==
Niuean consists of two main dialects, the older '''Motu''' dialect from the north of the island and the '''Tafiti''' dialect of the south. The words mean, respectively, ''the people of the island'' and ''the strangers'' (or ''people from a distance'').

The differences between the dialects are mainly in vocabulary or in the form of some words.

Examples of differences in vocabulary are '''volu''' (Tafiti) vs '''matā''' (Motu) for ''scrape, scraper'' and '''lala''' (Tafiti) vs '''kautoga''' (Motu) for ''guava (plant)''; examples of differences in form include '''hafule''' (T) / '''afule''' (M), '''aloka'''/'''haloka''', '''nai'''/'''nei''', '''ikiiki'''/'''likiliki''', and '''malona'''/'''maona'''.

{{IPA|[s]}} is an allophone of {{IPA|/t/}} before front vowels (both long and short {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/e/}}; this most likely arose from the affrication of {{IPA|/t/}} to {{IPA|[ts]}} before these vowels and subsequent change of {{IPA|[ts]}} to {{IPA|[s]}}.  While older foreign borrowings (such as ''tī'' from English ''tea'') underwent this change along with (or perhaps by analogy with) native words, words borrowed into Niuean after this development retain the original {{IPA|[t]}} (for example, ''telefoni'' and ''tikulī'' from ''telephone'' and ''degree'').

{{IPA|/r/}} and {{IPA|/s/}} are marginal phonemes, only appearing in foreign borrowings.  Some speakers substitute {{IPA|[l]}} and {{IPA|[t]}}, respectively.

[[Vowel length]] is distinctive in Niuean; vowels are either long or short. Furthermore, two adjacent identical vowels (whether short-short, short-long, long-short, or long-long) form a ''[[#Rearticulation|rearticulated vowel]]''; the sound is distinct from one long vowel.

Both short and long vowels can occur in any position.

All short vowels may combine with one another to form diphthongs. The possible diphthongs are:

*{{IPA|/ae/ /ai/ /ao/ /au/}}
*{{IPA|/ea/ /ei/ /eo/ /eu/}}
*{{IPA|/ia/ /ie/ /io/ /iu/}}
*{{IPA|/oa/ /oe/ /oi/ /ou/}}
*{{IPA|/ua/ /ue/ /ui/ /uo/}}

=== Rearticulation ===
'''Rearticulation''' is the separate pronunciation of two adjacent vowels, as opposed to [[diphthong]]s which are written as two letters but pronounced as one sound. These two vowels may be the same or be different ones.

Rearticulation typically occurs across [[morpheme]] boundaries, for example, when a suffix ending with a vowel comes before a root beginning with that same vowel. It may also occur, rarely, within monomorphemic words (words that consist of only one morpheme) as a result of the elision of a historical intervocalic consonant.

Two adjacent identical short vowels are always rearticulated, as are combinations of any two long vowels or a short and a long vowel; two adjacent different short vowels may be rearticulated or form a diphthong, and this has to be determined from the morphology or history of the word.

=== Syllable structure ===
The basic structure of a Niuean syllable is (C)V(V); all syllables end in a vowel or diphthong, and may start with at most one consonant. Consonant clusters in borrowed words are broken up with [[epenthesis|epenthetic vowels]], e.g. English ''tractor'' becomes {{lang|niu|tuleketā}}.

=== Stress ===
The stress on a Niuean word is nearly always on the penult (second-to-last syllable), though multi-syllable words ending in a long vowel put primary stress on the final long vowel and secondary stress on the penult. Long vowels in other positions also attract a secondary stress.

=== Glottal stop ===
The Niuean language does not contain the [[glottal stop]] which is present in its closest relative, [[Tongan language|Tongan]]; this has caused some distinct words to merge. For example, Tongan {{lang|to|ta{{okina}}u}} ''year'' and {{lang|to|tau}} ''fight'' have merged in Niuean as {{lang|niu|tau}}.

== Orthography ==
Niuean [[orthography]] is largely phonemic; that is, one letter stands for one sound and ''vice versa''.

=== Alphabet ===
The traditional alphabet order, given with the traditional names of the letters, is '''ā, ē, ī, ō, ū, fā, gā, hā, kā, lā, mō, nū, pī, tī, vī, rō, sā'''. Note that '''rō''' and '''sā''' as introduced letters are ordered at the end.

Sperlich (1997) uses an alphabetical order based on English for his dictionary: '''a, ā, e, ē, f, g, h, i, ī, k, l, m, n, o, ō, p, s, t, u, ū, v''' ('''r''' is left out since no words start with this letter). He recommends that consonants be named consistently with a following ā: '''fā, gā, hā, kā, lā, mā, nā, pā, tā, vā, rā, sā'''.

Vowel length can be marked with a [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]]; however, this is not always done.

=== History ===
As with many languages, writing was brought to Niue in connection with religion, in this case with [[Christianity]] by missionaries educated in [[Samoa]]. This has led to some Samoan influences in morphology and grammar and also to a noticeable one in spelling: as in Samoan, the sound {{IPA|/ŋ/}} ([[Help:IPA]]) is written '''g''', rather than '''ng''' as in Tongan and some other Polynesian languages with this sound. (McEwen (1970) uses '''ng''' in his dictionary; however, this feature of his spelling was not popular, particularly since it conflicted with the spelling used in the Niuean Bible.)

== Grammar ==
=== Typology ===
Niuean can be considered a [[verb–subject–object|VSO]] language; however, one analysis of Niuean uses [[ergative case|ergative]] terminology, in which case it may be better to speak of verb–agent–patient word order.

Because the unmarked case is the absolutive, Niuean transitive verb constructions often appear passive in a literal translation.

Compare

: {{lang|niu|Kua kitia e ia e kalahimu}}
: TENSE see AGENT he ARTICLE crab
: "The crab was seen by him"

and

: {{lang|niu|Kua kitia e kalahimu}}
: TENSE see ARTICLE crab
: "The crab was seen"

The first example sentence could also be translated into English as the nominative–accusative construction "He saw the crab".

=== Pronouns ===
Niuean [[pronoun]]s are differentiated by [[grammatical person|person]] and [[grammatical number|number]]. Furthermore, first person non-[[Grammatical number|singular]] ([[dual grammatical number|dual]] and [[plural]]) pronouns distinguish '''inclusive''' and '''exclusive''' forms, including and excluding the listener, respectively. However, they are not differentiated by [[grammatical gender|gender]] or [[declension|case]]; for example, '''ia''' means both ''he'' and ''she'', ''him'' and ''her'' (inanimates ['it'] are not usually pronominalised).

The Niuean pronouns are:

{| class="wikitable"
!&amp;nbsp;!!singular!!dual!!plural
|-
|first person (inclusive)
|rowspan="2"|au||taua||tautolu
|-
|first person (exclusive)||maua||mautolu
|-
|second person||koe||mua||mutolu
|-
|third person||ia||laua||lautolu
|}

Note that the endings of the dual and plural forms resemble the numbers 2 and 3, '''ua''' and '''tolu'''.

=== Numbers ===
Some numbers in Niuean are:

{| class="wikitable"
!1
|taha
!10
|hogofulu
!100
|taha e teau
!1000
|taha e afe
|-
!2
|ua
!20
|uafulu
!200
|ua (e) teau
!2000
|ua (e) afe
|-
!3
|tolu
!30
|tolugofulu
!300
|tolu (e) teau
!3000
|tolu (e) afe
|-
!4
|fa*
!40
|fagofulu
!etc.
|etc.
!etc.
|etc.
|-
!5
|lima
!50
|limagofulu
|-
!6
|ono
!etc.
|etc.
|-
!7
|fitu
|-
!8
|valu
|-
!9
|hiva
|}

(*Note: Both McEwen (1970) and Sperlich (1997) give '''fā''' for four; however, Kaulima &amp; Beaumont (1994) give '''fa''' with a short vowel.)

Tens and ones combine with '''ma''', e.g. '''hogofulu ma taha''', 11; '''tolugofulu ma ono''', 36.

The numbers from one to nine (and occasionally higher numbers) can take the prefix '''toko-''' when used to count persons; for example, '''tokolima''' ''five (for people)''.

Numbers are used as verbs, for example:

:''Ne taha e fufua moa i loto he kato''
:PAST one ART egg chicken LOC inside GEN basket
:"There was one egg in the basket"; literally, "Was one an egg inside the basket"

or

:''Tolu e tama fuata ne oatu ke takafaga''
:three ART child youth REL go GOAL hunt
:"Three young men went out hunting"; literally, "Three (were) the young men who went out to hunt"

or

:''Ko e tau maaga ne fa''
:PRED ART PLUR village REL four
:"There were (are) four villages"; literally, "The villages, which were four"

=== Morphology ===
[[Morphology (linguistics)|Morphology]] comprises the ways in which words are built up from smaller, meaningful sub-units, or how words change their form in certain circumstances.

==== Suppletion ====
'''Suppletion''' concerns closely related words (often singular and plural forms of nouns or verbs) which are based on very different forms, for example '''fano''' ''to go'' (used with a singular subject) and '''ō''' ''to go'' (used with a plural subject). This can be compared to English ''go'' and ''went'', which are forms of the same verb yet differ in form.

==== Reduplication ====
[[Reduplication]] is frequently used in Niuean morphology to derive different nouns. Reduplication is the process of taking the entire morpheme, or sometimes only the first or last syllable or two, and repeating it.

This is used for several purposes, including:

*forming a "plural" verb from a "singular" one (that is, a verb form used when the subject is plural, as opposed to the form used when the subject is singular)
*forming a "[[frequentative]]" form of a verb (an action that is carried out several times)

An example of a whole-morpheme reduplication indicating a plural verb is '''molemole''' ''to have passed by, to be gone'' from '''mole''' ''to have passed by, to be gone''; an example of a whole-morpheme reduplication indicating a frequentative verb is '''molomolo''' ''to keep squeezing'' from '''molo''' ''to squeeze, to compress''.

Examples of part-morpheme reduplication are '''gagau''' ''to bite'' from '''gau''' ''to chew'' (first part of the syllable reduplicated), '''gegele''' ''to make a crying sound'' from '''gele''' ''to start to cry (of babies'') (first syllable reduplicated), and '''molūlū''' ''to be very soft, to be very weak'' from '''molū''' ''to be soft, to be weak'' (last syllable reduplicated).

Reduplication is also frequently employed together with [[#Affixes|affixes]].

==== Affixes ====
[[Affix]]es ([[Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]]es and [[suffix]]es) are frequently used for a variety of purposes; there is also one [[circumfix]], '''fe-&amp;nbsp;-aki''' (sometimes '''fe-&amp;nbsp;-naki''' or '''fe-&amp;nbsp;-taki'''), which is used to form reciprocal verbs ("to ... one another").

A common suffix is '''-aga''', which is a nominaliser: it forms nouns from verbs.

A common prefix with '''faka-''', with a variety of meanings, the most common being a causative one (e.g. '''ako''' ''to learn'', '''fakaako''' ''to teach'').

Words may also have more than one prefix or suffix, as '''fakamalipilipi''' ''to break'' (used with a plural object), from '''faka-''', '''ma-''', and a [[#Reduplication|reduplicated]] '''lipi''' ''to break''.

==== Compound words ====
Many words are simply formed by joining together other words, for example '''vakalele''' ''aeroplane'' from '''vaka''' ''canoe'' and '''lele''' ''fly'' (i.e. literally, ''flying canoe''). [[Diane Massam]] has extensively studied a special type of compounding which she has termed pseudo noun incorporation, a type of [[noun incorporation]].

In [[journalism]], a '''nut graph''' is a [[paragraph]] that explains the context of the story.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term is also spelled as '''nut graf''', '''nut 'graph''', '''nutgraph''', '''nutgraf'''. It is a [[Contraction (grammar)|contraction]] of the expression '''nutshell paragraph.'''

In most news stories, the essential facts of a story are included in the [[Lead paragraph|lead]], the first sentence or two of the story. Good leads try to answer [[Five Ws|who, what, when, where, why, and how]] as quickly as possible.{{fact|date=November 2012}}

The nut graf, which often will start in the third, fourth, or fifth paragraph, will explain any additional context for why the story is important. For example, if the news story concerns a candidate for an upcoming election, the nut graph will state when the election is and may expand upon issues of the election. If the new story is part of an ongoing story, the nut graph will likely summarize other recent events related to the newest revelations. For example, a story published tomorrow about new discoveries related to the death of Jamal Khashoggi would have a nut graph detailing the circumstances of his death on Oct. 2, his role as a Saudi critic, and the shifting Saudi explanations for his death.

Zylbercweig notes that the scholar [[Saul Borovoy|Sh. Borovoy]] gives Lerner's birthdate as 1 January 1849.&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''Y. Y. (Yosef Yehuda) Lerner''', was a 19th-century [[Russia]]n [[Jew]]ish intellectual, writer, and critic. Originally a ''maskil''&amp;mdash;a propagator of the ''[[Haskala]]'', or "Jewish Enlightenment"&amp;mdash;he became a pioneer in the fields of Yiddish theater and folklore, as well as literary criticism.&lt;ref&gt;Gottesman, Itzik Nakhmen (2003). ''Defining the Yiddish Nation: The Jewish Folklorists of Poland''. Detroit: Wayne State University Press. p. xvii. "Lerner ... was a pioneer in the fields of Yiddish theater, Yiddish folklore, and especially Yiddish literary criticism."&lt;/ref&gt; In his later years he converted to [[Christianity]] and wrote a book denouncing Jews (Adler, 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;200).

==Biography==
Lerner was born in Berdyczów (Ukraine), then in the [[Russian Empire]]. After attending the Jewish school there, at age 13 he went to study at the gymnasium in nearby [[Zhytomyr]]. In 1866 he moved to [[Odessa]], where for one year he attended lectures in the law faculty of the recently founded [[Odessa University]], and thereafter began to devote himself entirely to literary pursuits (Reyzen, 1927, col. 269).

In 1881, shortly after the assassination of Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], Lerner leased the Mariinsky Theater in [[Odessa]], [[Ukraine]] (then part of [[Imperial Russia]]) to present [[Yiddish theater]]. He first presented plays by [[N.M. Sheikevitch]] and [[Moshe Leib Lilienblum]], then was the first to present classic European theater in [[Yiddish]], translating the material but not radically altering it or adding songs.

He has been a professor, teacher, and [[orator|public speaker]] on human [[learning]] for around 20 years, and taught his own children to read using the multi-sensory approach that he developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Allan |last=Koay |title=Window of Opportunity |url=http://thestar.com.my/lifestyle/story.asp?file=/2007/6/28/lifeparenting/17928768&amp;sec=lifeparenting |work=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]] |date= June 8, 2007 |accessdate= February 27, 2009 |archiveurl=http://thestar.com.my/lifestyle/story.asp?file=/2007/6/28/lifeparenting/17928768&amp;sec=lifeparenting |archivedate= October 23, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the founder of the Infant Learning Company, a company that produces learning products for infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=On Target |last=Brackemyre |first=J |year=2005 |publisher= [[College Press Publications]] |location=[[Joplin, Missouri|Joplin]], [[Missouri]] |isbn=0899009409 |page=55 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AX4tpoEsagoC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq=%22Robert+Titzer%22&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=2m6oSa3DJJDmkATIrMGEBA }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and degrees==
Titzer received his teaching credentials from [[San Diego State University]]. In the late 1980s, he taught at public schools in [[Guam]] and [[California]]. In 1985, he earned a communications degree from the [[University of Southern Indiana]]. He later completed a [[Master of Science]] degree from [[Pennsylvania State University]] and received a [[doctorate]] in human performance from the [[Indiana University Bloomington]].&lt;ref name="ABC7"&gt;{{cite news |title=Teaching Baby To Read |url=http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=resources&amp;id=4265738 | publisher =[[WLS-TV]]  |date= June 13, 2006 |accessdate= February 27, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5thyhg7Bk |archivedate= October 23, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At Bloomington, he did experiments in infant learning at [[developmental psychology]] laboratories. During his tenure as professor at [[Southeastern Louisiana University]], Titzer developed a program to teach toddlers to read.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jason |last=Ludwig |title=Expert: Your baby can read |url=http://www.ahwatukee.com/articles/read_853___article.html/children_titzer.html |work=[[Ahwatukee Foothills News]] |publisher=[[Freedom Communications]] |date= June 15, 2007 |accessdate= February 27, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080217044447/http://www.ahwatukee.com/articles/read_853___article.html/children_titzer.html |archivedate= February 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also been a professor at [[Pennsylvania State University]], [[Indiana University]], and [[California State University, Fullerton]].&lt;ref name="ABC7"/&gt;

===Publications ===
A search of the [[PsychINFO]] database reveals three publications which include Titzer as an author.  He was one of four co-authors of a paper which was published in 1999 in ''[[Psychological Review]]'', titled "The Task Dynamics of the A-Not-B Error". The other two citations in PsychInfo include his dissertation, which concerned the infant's understanding of the visual cliff, and a paper he co-authored in 1993, "The influence of reminder trials on contextual interference effects."

==Occupation==
In 1997, Titzer began selling "Your Baby Can Read!" videos. By 2003, around 60,000 had been sold.[[Robert Titzer#cite note-8|&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt;]]  In September 2007, Dr. Titzer and his company sold the rights to his programs to a new company that exclusively advertised and sold the products in North America. In April 2011, a complaint was filed with the FTC against this new company. The complaint, by the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, said the new company's advertising claims were false and deceptive. In July 2012, the new company folded, citing the high cost of fighting legal battles.[[Robert Titzer#cite note-9|&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt;]] At that time, the rights to the programs reverted to Dr. Titzer and his company. Titzer also trains preschool teachers in many countries and he consults with learning centers and preschools in India, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Indonesia, the United States, and China.

==Other Opinions==
Though there have been millions of fans of Dr. Titzer and his products,  some people have criticized Titzer's videos as being suspect because they lack rigorous scientific review and are commercial products.&lt;ref name="Gale"/&gt;

In November 2010, [[Jeff Rossen]] and [[Robert Powell]] of [[NBC]]'s ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' wrote that Titzer "calls himself an infant learning expert but actually holds a graduate degree in 'human performance' — the study of motor skills."&lt;ref name="Jeff Rossen and Robert Powell"&gt;{{cite news |title='Your Baby Can Read' Claims Overblown, Experts Say |author= [[Jeff Rossen|Rossen, Jeff]]; Powell, Robert |url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/39953918/ns/today-today_money/t/your-baby-can-read-claims-overblown-experts-say/ |work=[[Today (NBC program)|Today]] |date= November 1, 2010 |accessdate= June 16, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zUiGBDea |archivedate= June 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maryanne Wolf]], [[Tufts University]]'s director of [[cognitive neuroscience]], said: "It's an extraordinary manipulation of facts."&lt;ref name="Jeff Rossen and Robert Powell"/&gt; ''Today'' interviewed ten experts who affirmed that the brains of babies and toddlers had not attained the requisite development to read at "the level the way the enticing television ads claim they can".&lt;ref name="Jeff Rossen and Robert Powell"/&gt; Titzer argued against these claims, saying that scientific research supported the effectiveness of Your Baby Can Read.&lt;ref name="Jeff Rossen and Robert Powell"/&gt; There have been more than a dozen mostly very positive studies on the program which is likely more than any other baby learning product.

On August 22, 2014, a press release from the Federal Trade Commission related the following:
"Your Baby Can Read creator, Dr. Robert Titzer, and his company, Infant Learning, Inc. d/b/a The Infant Learning Company have settled charges that they made baseless claims about the effectiveness of the Your Baby Can Read program and misrepresented that scientific studies proved the claims.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Defendants Settle FTC Charges Related to "Your Baby Can Read" Program |url=http://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2014/08/defendants-settle-ftc-charges-related-your-baby-can-read-program |date=August 22, 2014 |publisher=Federal Trade Commission Bureau of Consumer Protection}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Titzer now has broken his ties with the marketing company which used infomercials to sell the products in huge numbers. He now often works with people in the field of early childhood education to market the products.

'''Roman Urdu''' is the name used for the [[Urdu language]] written with the [[Roman script]].

According to the Urdu scholar [[Habib R. Sulemani]]: "Roman Urdu is strongly opposed by the traditional [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic script]] lovers. Despite this opposition it is still used by most on the internet and computers due to limitations of most technologies as they do not have the Urdu script. Although, this script is under development and thus the net users are using the Roman script in their own ways. Popular websites like [[Jang Group]] have devised their own schemes for Roman Urdu. This is of great advantage for those who are not able to read the Arabic script. MSN, Yahoo and some desi-chat-rooms are working as laboratories for the evolving new script and language (Roman Urdu)."&lt;ref&gt;[[The News International]], September 8, 2003, [https://web.archive.org/web/20040301145532/http://www.jang.com.pk/thenews/sep2003-daily/08-09-2003/oped/o5.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman [[Urdu]] is often used by multinational corporation like [[Unilever]] or [[Pepsi]] to save money and resources on printing and advertising while marketing their products in both India and Pakistan.

Although the idea of romanizing Urdu had been suggested several times, it was General [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] who most seriously suggested adopting the Roman script for Urdu and all Pakistani languages during his rule of the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dawn.com/2008/11/27/fea.htm#2 Paving new paths to romanise Urdu script], Mushir Anwar, [[Dawn (newspaper)]], Nov 27, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/28397723/Urdu-Language-Controversy The Urdu-English Controversy in Pakistan], Tariq Rahman, [[Modern Asian Studies]], Vol. 31, No. 1 (Feb., 1997), pp. 177-207&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.21stfebruary.org/eassy21_5.htm The Language Movement: An Outline] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119232520/http://www.21stfebruary.org/eassy21_5.htm |date=2012-11-19 }}, Rafiqul Islam&lt;/ref&gt; The suggestion was inspired to an extent by [[Atatürk's Reforms#Modenization|Atatürk's adoption of Roman for Turkish]] in [[Turkey]].

In India, where the Devanagari script is used, Roman Urdu was widely used in the [[Indian Army]], as well as in Christian mission schools, especially for translations of the Bible.&lt;ref name="Fārūqī2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fārūqī|first=Shamsurraḥmān|title=Early Urdu Literary Culture and History|year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=English|isbn=9780195652017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
[[File:Roman Urdu Bible.JPG|thumb|150px|left|Roman Urdu Bibles are used by many Christians from the South Asian subcontinent]]
[[Urdu]] was the dominant native language among Christians of [[Karachi]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], and [[Rajasthan]] in the 20th century and is still used today by some people in these Pakistani and Indian states. Pakistani and Indian Christians often used the Roman script for writing Urdu. Thus Roman Urdu was a common way of writing among the Christians in these states up to the 1960s. The Bible Society of India publishes Roman Urdu [[Bible]]s, which enjoyed sale late into the 1960s (though they are still published today). Church songbooks are also common in Roman Urdu. However, the usage of Roman Urdu in Christian contexts is declining in India with the wider use of [[Hindi]] and [[English language|English]] in the states.

[[Bollywood]], India's major film industry, uses a version of Roman script as the main script for its film titles. This is because Bollywood films have an appeal for viewers across [[South Asia]] and even in the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref name="Krishnamurthy2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gatewayhouse.in/kabul-diary-discovering-the-indian-connection/|title=Kabul Diary: Discovering the Indian connection|last=Krishnamurthy|first=Rajeshwari|date=28 June 2013|publisher=Gateway House: Indian Council on Global Relations|language=English|accessdate=13 March 2018|quote=Most Afghans in Kabul understand and/or speak Hindi, thanks to the popularity of Indian cinema in the country.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Devanāgarī]] script is used mostly by Hindi speakers while the [[Perso-Arabic script]] is used primarily by Urdu speakers. The language used in Bollywood films is often called Hindi, but most dialogues are actually written in [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]]—they can be understood by Urdu and Hindi speakers alike. Because the film industry wants to reach the largest possible audience, just using the [[Devanāgarī]] or [[Perso-Arabic script]] would be unfavorable for the Bollywood industry as few individuals are literate in both scripts. For this reason, the neutral [[Roman alphabet|Roman]] script is used for [[Bollywood]] film titles, though some films include the Hindi and Urdu scripts as well.&lt;ref name="Dwyer2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dwyer|first=Rachel|title=Filming the Gods: Religion and Indian Cinema|date=27 September 2006|publisher=Routledge|language=English|isbn=9781134380701|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The similar circumstances are also applied with Pakistan's [[Lollywood]] filming industry, where, along with the Urdu name or title of the movie, a Roman Urdu title is always provided for viewers.

Roman Urdu used on [[Internet]] is non standard and has very irregular spellings. Users who use Roman Urdu on Internet try to imitate [[English orthography]]. In most cases they are unaware of the fact that [[English language|English]] spellings are not often phonetic.

There are several Romanization standards for writing [[Urdu]] among them the most prominent are [[Uddin and Begum Urdu-Hindustani Romanization]], [[ALA-LC romanization]] and [[ArabTeX]].

There are two main problems with Roman Urdu schemes which exists. Either they are not reversible to [[Urdu script]] or they don't allow pronouncing the Urdu words properly. Another shortcoming is that a lot of Roman Urdu schemes confuse the Urdu letter 'Choti He' which has the sound of [[voiceless glottal fricative]] with 'Do Chasham He' which is used as a [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]] for [[aspirated consonant]]s in Urdu script. The digraphs "Sh" for letter Shin and "Zh" for letter Zhe also cause problems as they could be interpreted as the letter Sin and 'Choti He' or letter Ze and 'Choti He' respectively. Most Roman Urdu schemes also do not take much consideration of Urdu orthography and the spelling system.

==The Hamari Boli Initiative==
Initiated in 2011, the [https://web.archive.org/web/20130601231148/http://www.hamariboli.com/ Hamari Boli Initiative] is a full-scale [[open-source]] [[Language planning]] initiative aimed at [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] (Hindi-Urdu) Script, Style, Status &amp; Lexical reform and modernization. One of primary stated objectives of Hamari Boli is to relieve [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] of the crippling [[Devanagari]]-[[Nastaliq]] [[Digraphia]] by way of [[Romanization]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-4-84689-Hamari-boli-angraizon-ke-rasmul-khat-mein The News International - Dec 29, 2011] -- "Hamari Boli (our language) is perhaps one of the very first serious undertakings to explore, develop and encourage the growth of Roman script in the use of Urdu/Hindi language"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

In [[Pakistan]] Roman [[Urdu]] is promoted by the [[Liberalism|Liberal]], [[Secular]] and [[Westernized]] sections of the society as an alternate to the [[Perso-Arabic Script]] which [[Urdu]] uses. In contrast, the adoption of Roman [[Urdu]] has stiff opposition from the [[Conservative]] classes which see [[Perso-Arabic Script]] as the heritage of [[Islamic culture|Indo-Islamic Civilization]] which [[Pakistan]] inherited from the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] and other past [[Islamic]] empires.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15989">'''Sensory leakage''' is a term used to refer to information that transferred to a person by conventional means (other than [[Psi (parapsychology)|Psi]]) during an experiment into Psi.&lt;ref name=skeptdic1&gt;[[Robert Todd Carroll]].                                  (2014). [http://skepdic.com/sensoryleakage.html "Sensory Leakage]" in [[The Skeptic's Dictionary]].&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, where the subject in an ESP experiment receives a visual cue — the reflection of a [[Zener card]] in the holder's glasses — sensory leakage can be said to have occurred.

==History==
[[Image:Zener cards (color).svg|thumb|300px|right|Zener cards]]
{{Main|Parapsychology}}
Scientists such as [[Donovan Rawcliffe]] (1952), [[C. E. M. Hansel]] (1980), [[Ray Hyman]] (1989) and Andrew Neher (2011) have studied the history of psi experiments from the late 19th century up until the 1980s. In every experiment investigated, flaws and weaknesses were discovered so the possibility of naturalistic explanations (such as [[sensory cue]]s) or deception and trickery were not ruled out. The data from the Creery sister and the [[Samuel Soal|Soal-Goldney]] experiments were proven to be fraudulent, one of the subjects from the [[George Albert Smith (film pioneer)|Smith-Blackburn]] experiments confessed to fraud, the Brugmans experiment, the experiments by [[John E. Coover]] and those conducted by [[Joseph Gaither Pratt]] and [[Helmut Schmidt (parapsychologist)|Helmut Schmidt]] did not rule out the possibility of sensory cues or trickery.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donovan Rawcliffe]]. (1952). ''The Psychology of the Occult''. Derricke Ridgway, London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[C. E. M. Hansel]]. (1980). ''ESP and Parapsychology: A Critical Reevaluation''. Prometheus Books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ray Hyman]]. (1989). ''The Elusive Quarry: A Scientific Appraisal of Psychical Research''. Prometheus Books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Betty Markwick. ''The establishment of data manipulation in the Soal-Shackleton experiments'' in [[Paul Kurtz]]. (1985). ''A Skeptic’s Handbook of Parapsychology''. Prometheus Books. pp. 287-312&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Neher. (2011). ''Paranormal and Transcendental Experience: A Psychological Examination''. Dover Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century [[Joseph Banks Rhine|J. B. Rhine]] carried out experiments into [[extrasensory perception|ESP]]. His experiments were discredited due to the discovery that sensory leakage or cheating could account for all his results such as the subject being able to read the symbols from the back of the cards and being able to see and hear the experimenter to note subtle clues.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan C. Smith. (2009). [https://books.google.com/books?id=sJgONrua8IkC&amp;pg=PT226&amp;dq=rhine+pseudoscience&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MI2fUr7qIMqrhQelt4HgAg&amp;ved=0CDcQuwUwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=rhine%20pseudoscience&amp;f=false ''Pseudoscience and Extraordinary Claims of the Paranormal: A Critical Thinker's Toolkit'']. Wiley-Blackwell. {{ISBN|978-1405181228}}. "Today, researchers discount the first decade of Rhine's work with Zener cards. Stimulus leakage or cheating could account for all his findings. Slight indentations on the backs of cards revealed the symbols embossed on card faces. Subjects could see and hear the experimenter, and note subtle but revealing facial expressions or changes in breathing."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Terence Hines]] has written:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The methods the Rhines used to prevent subjects from gaining hints and clues as to the design on the cards were far from adequate. In many experiments, the cards were displayed face up, but hidden behind a small wooden shield. Several ways of obtaining information about the design on the card remain even in the presence of the shield. For instance, the subject may be able sometimes to see the design on the face-up card reflected in the agent’s glasses. Even if the agent isn’t wearing glasses it is possible to see the reflection in his cornea.&lt;ref&gt;[[Terence Hines]]. (2003). ''Pseudoscience and the Paranormal''. Prometheus Books. pp. 119-120&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Once Rhine took precautions in response to criticisms of his methods, he was unable to find any high-scoring subjects.&lt;ref&gt;[[Milbourne Christopher]]. (1970). ''ESP, Seers &amp; Psychics''. Thomas Y. Crowell Company. p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the methodological problems, parapsychologists no longer utilize card-guessing studies.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Alcock]]. (2011). [http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/back_from_the_future ''Back from the Future: Parapsychology and the Bem Affair'']. ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]''. "Despite Rhine’s confidence that he had established the reality of extrasensory perception, he had not done so. Methodological problems with his experiments eventually came to light, and as a result parapsychologists no longer run card-guessing studies and rarely even refer to Rhine’s work."&lt;/ref&gt; Rhine's experiments into [[psychokinesis]] (PK) were also criticized. [[John Thomas Sladek|John Sladek]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;His research used dice, with subjects 'willing' them to fall a certain way. Not only can dice be drilled, shaved, falsely numbered and manipulated, but even straight dice often show bias in the long run. Casinos for this reason retire dice often, but at Duke, subjects continued to try for the same effect on the same dice over long experimental runs. Not surprisingly, PK appeared at Duke and nowhere else.&lt;ref name="Sladek 1974"&gt;[[John Thomas Sladek|John Sladek]]. (1974). ''The New Apocrypha: A Guide to Strange Sciences and Occult Beliefs''. Panther. pp. 172-174&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Turner-Owenby long distance [[telepathy]] experiment was discovered to contain flaws. Frances May Turner positioned herself in the [[Rhine Research Center|Duke Parapsychology Laboratory]] whilst Sarah Owenby claimed to receive transmissions 250 miles away. For the experiment Turner would think of a symbol and write it down whilst Owenby would write her guesses.&lt;ref name="Sladek 1974"/&gt;  The scores were highly successful and both records were supposed to be sent to J. B. Rhine, however, Owenby sent them to Turner. Critics pointed out this invalidated the results as she could have simply written her own record to agree with the other. When the experiment was repeated and the records were sent to Rhine the scores dropped to average.&lt;ref name="Sladek 1974"/&gt;

A famous ESP experiment at the [[Duke University]] was performed by Lucien Warner and Mildred Raible. The subject was locked in a room with a switch controlling a signal light elsewhere, which he could signal to guess the card. Ten runs with ESP packs of cards were used and he achieved 93 hits (43 more than chance). Weaknesses with the experiment were later discovered. The duration of the light signal could be varied so that the subject could call for specific symbols and certain symbols in the experiment came up far more often than others which indicated either poor shuffling or card manipulation.&lt;ref name="Sladek 1974"/&gt;

==Ganzfeld experiment==
{{Main|Ganzfeld experiment}}
[[File:Ganzfeld.jpg|frame|right|Participant in a ganzfeld [[telepathy]] experiment]]
The [[ganzfeld experiment]] studies that were examined by Ray Hyman and [[Charles Honorton]] had methodological problems that were well documented. Honorton reported only 36% of the studies used duplicate target sets of pictures to avoid handling cues.&lt;ref&gt;Julie Milton, [[Richard Wiseman]]. (2002). ''A Response to Storm and Ertel (2002)''. The Journal of Parapsychology. Volume 66: 183-186.&lt;/ref&gt; Hyman discovered flaws in all of the 42 ganzfeld experiments and to assess each experiment, he devised a set of 12 categories of flaws. Six of these concerned statistical defects, the other six covered procedural flaws such as inadequate [[documentation]], randomization and security as well as possibilities of sensory leakage.&lt;ref name="Hyman2007"&gt;[[Ray Hyman]]. ''Evaluating Parapsychological Claims'' in Robert J. Sternberg, Henry L. Roediger, Diane F. Halpern. (2007). ''Critical Thinking in Psychology''. Cambridge University Press. pp. 216-231. {{ISBN|978-0521608343}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over half of the studies failed to safeguard against sensory leakage and all of the studies contained at least one of the 12 flaws. Because of the flaws, Honorton agreed with Hyman the 42 ganzfeld studies could not support the claim for the existence of psi.&lt;ref name="Hyman2007"/&gt;

Possibilities of sensory leakage in the ganzfeld experiments included the receivers hearing what was going on in the sender's room next door as the rooms were not soundproof and the sender's fingerprints to be visible on the target object for the receiver to see.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Wiseman]], Matthew Smith, Diana Kornbrot. (1996). ''Assessing possible sender-to-experimenter acoustic leakage in the PRL autoganzfeld''. Journal of Parapsychology. Volume 60: 97-128.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Todd Carroll]]. (2014).                                  [http://www.skepdic.com/ganzfeld.html "Ganzfeld]" in [[The Skeptic's Dictionary]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Hyman also reviewed the autoganzfeld experiments and discovered a pattern in the data that implied a visual cue may have taken place:

{{quote|The most suspicious pattern was the fact that the hit rate for a given target increased with the frequency of occurrence of that target in the experiment. The hit rate for the targets that occurred only once was right at the chance expectation of 25%. For targets that appeared twice the hit rate crept up to 28%. For those that occurred three times it was 38%, and for those targets that occurred six or more times, the hit rate was 52%. Each time a videotape is played its quality can degrade. It is plausible then, that when a frequently used clip is the target for a given session, it may be physically distinguishable from the other three decoy clips that are presented to the subject for judging. Surprisingly, the parapsychological community has not taken this finding seriously. They still include the autoganzfeld series in their meta-analyses and treat it as convincing evidence for the reality of psi.&lt;ref name="Hyman2007"/&gt;}}

Hyman wrote the autoganzfeld experiments were flawed because they did not preclude the possibility of sensory leakage.&lt;ref name="Hyman2007"/&gt;

==Remote viewing==
{{Main|Remote viewing}}

The psychologists [[David Marks (psychologist)|David Marks]] and Richard Kammann attempted to replicate [[Russell Targ]] and [[Harold E. Puthoff|Harold Puthoff]]’s remote viewing experiments. In a series of thirty-five studies, they were unable to replicate the results so investigated the procedure of the original experiments. Marks and Kammann discovered that the notes given to the judges in Targ and Puthoff's experiments contained clues as to which order they were carried out, such as referring to yesterday's two targets, or they had the date of the session written at the top of the page. They concluded that these clues were the reason for the experiment's high hit rates.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Marks (psychologist)|David Marks]], Richard Kammann. (1978). ''Information transmission in remote viewing experiments''. Nature 274: 680–81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[David Marks (psychologist)|David Marks]]. (1981). ''Sensory cues invalidate remote viewing experiments''. Nature 292: 177.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Terence Hines]]:

{{quote|Examination of the few actual transcripts published by Targ and Puthoff show that just such clues were present. To find out if the unpublished transcripts contained cues, Marks and Kammann wrote to Targ and Puthoff requesting copies. It is almost unheard of for a scientist to refuse to provide his data for independent examination when asked, but Targ and Puthoff consistently refused to allow Marks and Kammann to see copies of the transcripts. Marks and Kammann were, however, able to obtain copies of the transcripts from the judge who used them. The transcripts were found to contain a wealth of cues.&lt;ref&gt;[[Terence Hines]]. (2003). ''Pseudoscience and the Paranormal''. Prometheus Books. p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Thomas Gilovich]] has written:

{{quote|Most of the material in the transcripts consists of the honest attempts by the percipients to describe their impressions. However, the transcripts also contained considerable extraneous material that could aid a judge in matching them to the correct targets. In particular, there were numerous references to dates, times and sites previously visited that would enable the judge to place the transcripts in proper sequence... Astonishingly, the judges in the Targ-Puthoff experiments were given a list of target sites in the exact order in which they were used in the tests!&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Gilovich]]. (1993). ''How We Know What Isn't So: The Fallibility of Human Reason in Everyday Life''. Free Press. p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Marks, when the cues were eliminated the results fell to a chance level.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Marks (psychologist)|David Marks]], Richard Kammann. (1980). ''[[The Psychology of the Psychic]]''. Prometheus Books. {{ISBN|978-1573927987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marks was able to achieve 100 per cent accuracy without visiting any of the sites himself but by using cues.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Bridgstock. (2009). ''Beyond Belief: Skepticism, Science and the Paranormal''. Cambridge University Press. p. 106. {{ISBN|978-0521758932}} "The explanation used by Marks and Kammann clearly involves the use of Occam's razor. Marks and Kammann argued that the 'cues' - clues to the order in which sites had been visited - provided sufficient information for the results, without any recourse to extrasensory perception. Indeed Marks himself was able to achieve 100 per cent accuracy in allocating some transcripts to sites without visiting any of the sites himself, purely on the ground basis of the cues. From Occam's razor, it follows that if a straightforward natural explanation exists, there is no need for the spectacular paranormal explanation: Targ and Puthoff's claims are not justified."&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Randi]] has written controlled tests by several other researchers, eliminating several sources of cuing and extraneous evidence present in the original tests, produced negative results. Students were also able to solve Puthoff and Targ's locations from the clues that had inadvertently been included in the transcripts.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Randi]]. (1997). "[http://www.randi.org/encyclopedia/remote%20viewing.html Remote viewing]" in [[An Encyclopedia of Claims, Frauds, and Hoaxes of the Occult and Supernatural]]. St. Martin's Griffin.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marks and Kamman concluded: "Until remote viewing can be confirmed in conditions which prevent sensory cueing the conclusions of Targ and Puthoff remain an unsubstantiated hypothesis."&lt;ref&gt;[[C. E. M. Hansel]]. (1980). ''ESP and Parapsychology: A Critical Reevaluation''. Prometheus Books. p. 293&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, [[Charles Tart]] claimed that a rejudging of the transcripts from one of Targ and Puthoff’s experiments revealed an above-chance result.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Tart]], [[Harold E. Puthoff|Harold Puthoff]], [[Russell Targ]]. (1980). ''Information Transmission in Remote Viewing Experiments''. Nature 284: 191.&lt;/ref&gt; Targ and Puthoff again refused to provide copies of the transcripts and it was not until July 1985 that they were made available for study when it was discovered they still contained sensory cues.&lt;ref&gt;[[Terence Hines]]. (2003). ''Pseudoscience and the Paranormal''. Prometheus Books. p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; Marks and Christopher Scott (1986) wrote "considering the importance for the remote viewing hypothesis of adequate cue removal, Tart’s failure to perform this basic task seems beyond comprehension. As previously concluded, remote viewing has not been demonstrated in the experiments conducted by Puthoff and Targ, only the repeated failure of the investigators to remove sensory cues."&lt;ref&gt;[[David Marks (psychologist)|David Marks]], Christopher Scott. (1986). ''Remote Viewing Exposed''. Nature 319: 444.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wikipedia Main Page.png|thumb|[[Wikipedia]]'s layout features a sidebar on the left side.]]
In publishing, '''sidebar''' is a term for information placed adjacent to an article in a printed or Web publication, graphically separate but with contextual connection.

The term has long been used in [[newspaper]] and [[magazine]] [[page layout]]. It is often used as the title of legal groups' publications in the US as a pun on "the bar", a term for the legal profession: The Federal Bar Association,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fedbar.org/SideBAR]&lt;/ref&gt; Montgomery Bar Association of Norristown Pennsylvania,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.montgomerybar.org/publications/sidebar.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150224133257/https://www.montgomerybar.org/publications/sidebar.php |archivedate=2015-02-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Westmoreland Bar Association&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.montgomerybar.org/publications/sidebar.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150224133257/https://www.montgomerybar.org/publications/sidebar.php |archivedate=2015-02-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; are three examples.

It is now common in Web design, where sidebars originated as advertising space and have evolved to contain information such as quick links to other parts of the site, or links to related materials on other sites.  Online sidebars often include small bits of information such as quotes, polls, lists, pictures, site tools, etc.

The [[Mani people|Maniq]] language '''''Ten'edn''''', known in some of the previous literature as '''Tonga''', is an aboriginal [[Mon–Khmer language]] of Thailand and Malaya. It goes by the name Mos in Thailand, which it shares with [[Kensiu language|Kensiu]].  (The name Maniq is also shared with Kensiu.)

According to Benjamin (2012), Maniq (Məniʔ, Maniʔ) can refer to the following three or more speech varieties.
*Tonga' (Toŋaʔ)
*Mos (Mɔs)
*Teanean (Ten'en, Tɛnʔɛn, Tean-ean)

During the next 15 years it has been provided as a B2B solution that helps companies to create error-free writing for their business and ensure accuracy and professionalism.
