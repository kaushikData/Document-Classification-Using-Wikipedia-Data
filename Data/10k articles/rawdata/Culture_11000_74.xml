The '''Andaquí''' are an [[indigenous people of Colombia]], who live in the Upper [[Caquetá River]] Basin, the Fragua Valley of [[Cauca Department]], and the Suaza Valley of southwest [[Huila Department]].

== Name ==
The Andaquí, sometimes written ''Andakí'' are also known as the Aguanunga or Churuba.

== History ==
The Andakí are first mentioned in the texts of the [[List of conquistadors in Colombia|Spanish conquistadors]] in the late 16th century, several decades after the uprisings against the Spanish initiated under the leadership of La Cacica [[Gaitana]] in 1536, that united the Yalcon, Nasa, Timaná and other indigenous nations from the Upper Magdalena Valley. In 1637, conquistador Francisco Dias was attacked by the Andakí and [[Pijao people|Pijao]], which was reported in an act of the cabildo of Timaná on January 28 of that year. The Andakí resistance to colonization lasted until the 18th century and a 1721 uprising included all of the indigenous nations, such as the Andakí, Tama and Mocoa, of [[Putumayo Department|Putumayo]] and [[Caquetá Department|Caquetá]].

== Language ==
The [[Andakí language]] has been documented having two different recorded vocabularies. The first vocabulary is from an anonymous author from 1788 published in ''Lenguas de America'' (1928) and another recompilation by [[Manuel María Abis]], published in 1855. Based on these works, Rivet (1924) classified Andakí as a [[Chibcha language]]. Though that classification was supported by some experts, others consider Andakí as a language isolate or without classification and others group it with [[Páez language|Páez]] or other languages from the [[Amazon Basin|Amazonian]] foothills such [[Astinigua language|Astinigua]], [[Camsá language|Camsá]] and [[Cofán language|Cofán]].

== Currently ==
Currently Andaki communities survive in rural [[Acevedo, Huila|Acevedo]], Huila and Belén de los Andaquíes, Caqueta, in the areas of the Pescado and Fragua Rivers, though these communities do not conserve their language. These communities are not recognized by the Colombian government though are documented by the National Indigenous Organization of Colombia as Andakí communities. According to elders from the Inga People that now live in part of what was the ancestral Andakí territory, they insist that there are still Andaquí in the forests below the Fragua peaks in the south of  Cauca that refuse contact. Documents from the 19th century cite that area as the last known area of the jungle inhabited by the Andaquí.

'''Antifeminism''' (also spelt '''anti-feminism''') is broadly defined as opposition to some or all forms of [[feminism]]. This opposition has taken various forms across time and cultures. For example, antifeminists in the late 19th century and early 20th century resisted [[women's suffrage]], while antifeminists in the late 20th century in the [[United States]] opposed the [[Equal Rights Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ford|first=Lynne E.|title=Encyclopedia of Women and American Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cVtFJ5tvINsC&amp;pg=PA36|year=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-1032-5|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="maddux" /&gt; Others, particularly in the 21st century, see antifeminism as a response to an ideology rooted in hostility towards men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/01/30/how-anti-feminism-is-shaping-world-politics/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.3b1021768c79 |title= How anti-feminism is shaping world politics  |work = Washington  Post |accessdate=October 25, 2018  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2018/07/anti-feminist-youtuber-sydney-watson-launces-march-for-men-in-melbourne.html |title= 'Anti-feminist' YouTuber Sydney Watson launches March for Men in Melbourne  |work =News hub |accessdate=October 25, 2018  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, K.J., Kanner, M. and Elsayegh, N. (2009), "[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1471-6402.2009.01491.x/abstract Are Feminists Man Haters?

== Overview ==
Sociologist [[Michael Flood]] argues that an antifeminist ideology rejects at least one of the following general principles of feminism:

#That [[sociology of gender|social arrangements]] among men and women are neither natural nor divinely determined.
#That social arrangements among men and women [[patriarchy|favor men.]]
#That there are collective actions that can and should be taken to transform these arrangements into more just and equitable arrangements, such as those in the timelines of [[timeline of women's suffrage|woman's suffrage]] and [[timeline of women's rights (other than voting)|other rights]].&lt;ref name="flood"&gt;[[Kenneth Clatterbaugh|Clatterbaugh, Kenneth]] (2007), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=T54J3Q_VwnIC&amp;pg=PA21 Anti-feminism]", in {{cite book|editor-last1=Flood |editor-first1=Michael | editor-last2 = Kegan Gardiner | editor-first2 = Judith |editor-last3= Pease |editor-first3= Bob | editor-last4 = Pringle | editor-first4 = Keith | editor-link1 = Michael Flood | title = International encyclopedia of men and masculinities | pages = 21&amp;ndash;22 | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | isbn = 9780415333436 |year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian sociologists Melissa Blais and Francis Dupuis-Déri write that antifeminist thought has primarily taken the form of an extreme version of [[masculism|masculinism]], in which "men are in crisis because of the feminization of society".&lt;ref name="Blais &amp; Dupuis-Déri"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blais|first1=Melissa|last2=Francis Dupuis-Déri|first2=Francis |title=Masculinism and the antifeminist countermovement |journal=Journal of Social, Cultural and Political Protest |volume=11 |issue=1|pages=21&amp;ndash;39|doi=10.1080/14742837.2012.640532 | year=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''antifeminist'' is also used{{By whom|date=September 2017}} to describe public female figures, some of whom (such as [[Naomi Wolf]], [[Camille Paglia]], and [[Katie Roiphe|Kate Roiphe]]) define themselves as feminists, based on their opposition to some or all elements of feminist movements.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hammer|first=Rhonda|title=Anti‐feminists as media celebrities |journal=Review of Education, Pedagogy, and Cultural Studies |volume=22 |issue=3|pages=207&amp;ndash;222 |doi=10.1080/1071441000220303|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other feminists label writers such as [[Christina Hoff Sommers]], [[Jean Bethke Elshtain]], [[Katie Roiphe]] and [[Elizabeth Fox-Genovese]] with this term&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Stacey | first = Judith | title = Is academic feminism an oxymoron? | journal = [[Signs (journal)|Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society]] | volume = 25 | issue = 4 | pages = 1189&amp;ndash;1194 | doi = 10.1086/495543 | date = Summer 2000 | jstor = 3175510 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Kamarck Minnich | first = Elizabeth | title = Feminist attacks on feminisms: patriarchy's prodigal daughters  | journal = [[Feminist Studies]] | volume = 24 | issue = 1 | pages = 159&amp;ndash;175 | doi = 10.2307/3178629  | date = Spring 1998 | jstor = 3178629 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; because of their positions regarding oppression and lines of thought within feminism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last1 = Jervis | editor-first1 = Lisa | editor-last2 = Zeisler | editor-first2 = Andi | title = BITCHfest : ten years of cultural criticism from the pages of Bitch magazine | publisher = Farrar, Straus and Giroux | location = New York | year = 2006 | isbn = 9780374113438 }} (Foreword by Margaret Cho.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The meaning of antifeminism has varied across time and cultures, and antifeminism attracts both men and women. Some women, like those in the [[Women's National Anti-Suffrage League]], campaigned against women's suffrage.

Men's studies scholar [[Michael Kimmel]] defines antifeminism as "the opposition to women's equality". He says that antifeminists oppose "women's entry into the public sphere, the re-organization of the private sphere, women's control of their bodies, and women's rights generally." Kimmel further writes that antifeminist argumentation relies on "religious and cultural norms" while proponents of antifeminism advance their cause as a means of "'saving' masculinity from pollution and invasion". He argues that antifeminists consider the "traditional gender division of labor as natural and inevitable, perhaps also divinely sanctioned."&lt;ref name="Kimmel" /&gt;

== Antifeminist stances ==
Some antifeminists view feminism as a denial of innate [[Sex differences in psychology|differences between the genders]], and an attempt to reprogram people against their biological tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;Hampton, Jean (1996), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=pfYSzwWrBbYC&amp;pg=PA10 The case for feminism]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Leahy | editor-first = Michael P.T. | title = The liberation debate: rights at issue | page = 10 | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | isbn = 9780415116947 | year = 1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Antifeminists also frequently argue that feminism, despite claiming to espouse equality, ignores rights issues unique to men. Some believe that the [[feminist movement]] has achieved its aims and now seeks higher status for women than for men via special rights and exemptions, such as female-only scholarships, affirmative action, and gender quotas.&lt;ref name="(Wattenberg, B 1994)"&gt;{{cite web | last = Wattenberg | first = Ben |title=Has feminism gone too far? | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20061013145104/http://www.menweb.org/paglsomm.htm| archive-date= 13 October 2006 |url=http://www.menweb.org/paglsomm.htm| deadurl= no |accessdate=30 September 2006|publisher=MenWeb |year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="(Pizzey, E 1999)"&gt;{{cite web | last = Pizzey | first = Erin | author-link = Erin Pizzey |title=How the women's movement taught women to hate men | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060926183932/http://www.fathersforlife.org/pizzey/how_women_were_taught_to_hate_men.htm | archive-date= 26 September 2006 |url= http://www.fathersforlife.org/pizzey/how_women_were_taught_to_hate_men.htm | deadurl= no |publisher=Fathers for Life|year=1999 |accessdate=30 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="(JSC 2006)"&gt;{{cite web | last = Shaw Crouse | first = Janice | title = What Friedan wrought | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060427170136/http://www.beverlylahayeinstitute.org/articledisplay.asp?id=10088&amp;department=BLI&amp;categoryid=dotcommentary | archive-date = 27 April 2006 | url = http://www.beverlylahayeinstitute.org/articledisplay.asp?id=10088&amp;department=BLI&amp;categoryid=dotcommentary | publisher = Concerned Women for America | date = 7 February 2006 | accessdate = 30 September 2006 | deadurl = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some antifeminists have argued that feminism has resulted in changes to society's previous norms relating to sexuality, which they see as detrimental to traditional values or conservative religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Desai, Murli (2014), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hUPhAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA119 Feminism and policy approaches for gender aware development]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Desai | editor-first = Murli | title = The paradigm of international social development: ideologies, development systems and policy approaches | page = 119 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2014 | isbn = 9781135010256 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barthalow Koch, Patricia (2004), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dciuj1-F3fYC&amp;pg=PA1163 Feminism and sexuality in the United States]", in {{cite book | editor-last1 = Francoeur | editor-first1 = Robert T. | editor-last2 = Noonan | editor-first2 = Raymond J. | title = The Continuum complete international encyclopedia of sexuality | page = 1163 | publisher = Continuum | location = New York | year = 2004 | isbn = 9780199754700 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jaggar, Alison (1983), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xVI6ZYDkDSYC&amp;pg=PA75 Traditional Marxism and human nature]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Jaggar | editor-first = Alison | title = Feminist politics and human | page = 75 | publisher = Rowman &amp; Allanheld | location = Totowa, N.J | year = 1983 | isbn = 9780710806536 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the ubiquity of [[casual sex]] and the decline of marriage are mentioned as negative consequences of feminism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kassian | first = Mary A. | title = The feminist mistake: the radical impact of feminism on church and culture | publisher = Crossway Books | location = Wheaton, Illinois | year = 2005 | isbn = 9781581345704 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lukas | first = Carrie L. | title = The politically incorrect guide to women, sex, and feminism | publisher = Regency Publishing | location = Washington, DC Lanham, MD | year = 2006 | isbn = 9781596980037 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these traditionalists oppose women's entry [[Women in the workforce|into the workforce]], [[Women in government|political office]], and the voting process, as well as the lessening of male authority in families.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Busch | first = Elizabeth Kaufer | contribution = Women against liberation | editor-last1 = Busch | editor-first1 = Elizabeth Kaufer | editor-last2 = Lawler | editor-first2 = Peter Augustine | title = Democracy reconsidered | page = 242 | publisher = Lexington Books | location = Lanham, Maryland | year = 2009 | isbn = 9780739124819 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Antifeminists argue that a change of women's roles is a destructive force that endangers the family, or is contrary to religious morals. For example, [[Paul Gottfried]] maintains that the change of women's roles "has been a social disaster that continues to take its toll on the family" and contributed to a "descent by increasingly disconnected individuals into social chaos".&lt;ref name="(Gottfried, Paul 2002)"&gt;{{cite web | last = Gottfried |first = Paul|url=https://www.lewrockwell.com/2001/04/paul-gottfried/the-trouble-with-feminism/|title=The trouble with feminism|accessdate=30 September 2006|publisher=LewRockwell.com|date=21 April 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History == 
[[File:Antisuffragists.jpg|thumb|American antisuffragists in the early 20th century]]

=== 19th century ===
The "women's movement" began in 1848, most famously articulated by [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton|Elizabeth Stanton]] and [[Susan B. Anthony]], asking for voting rights and many other rights, such as education, job liberties, marital and property rights, and the right to choose whether to be a mother or not.&lt;ref&gt;[[Susan Faludi|Faludi, Susan]] (1992), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Irp3sOCk5cUC&amp;pg=PA69 Backlashes then and now]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Faludi | editor-first = Susan | editor-link = Susan Faludi | title = Backlash: the undeclared war against women | page = 69 | publisher = Vintage | location = London | isbn = 9781409043447 | date = 2010-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the end of the century, a cultural counter movement had begun. Janet Chafetz identified in a study 32 first-wave antifeminist movements, including those in the 19th century and early 20th century movements.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Chafetz |first= Janet |last2= Dworkin |first2= Anthony | title = In the face of threat: organized antifeminism in comparative perspective | journal = [[Gender &amp; Society]] | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 33&amp;ndash;60 | doi = 10.1177/089124387001001003 | jstor = 190086 | date = March 1987 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; These countermovements were in response to some women's growing demands, which were perceived as threatening to the standard way of life. Though men were not the only antifeminists, men experienced what some have called a "crisis of masculinity"&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Kimmel | first = Michael S. | author-link = Michael Kimmel | title = Men's responses to feminism at the turn of the century | journal = [[Gender and Society]] | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pages = 261&amp;ndash;283 | doi = 10.1177/089124387001003003 | jstor = 189564 | date = September 1987 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; in response to traditional gender roles being challenged. Men's responses to increased feminism varied. Some men even subscribed to feminist ideology, but others went the other direction and became decidedly antifeminist. The men who believed in this model cited religious models and natural law to emphasize women's need to return to the private sphere, in order to separate men and women to keep women from outwardly challenging men in public.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In the 19th century, one of the major focal points of antifeminism was opposition to [[women's suffrage]], which began as a grassroots movement in 1848 and spanned for 72 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Dolton | first = Patricia F. | title = The alert collector: women's suffrage movement | journal = [[Reference and User Services Quarterly]] | volume = 54 | issue = 2 | pages = 31&amp;ndash;36 | doi = 10.5860/rusq.54n2.31 | date = 2014 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="maddux"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Maddux | first = Kristy | title = When patriots protest: the anti-suffrage discursive transformation of 1917 | journal = Rhetoric &amp; Public Affairs | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 283&amp;ndash;310 | doi = 10.1353/rap.2005.0012 | date = Fall 2004 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of women's entry into institutions of higher learning argued that education was too great a physical burden on women.

Through his efforts, the League garnered attention from pro-family advocates. It underwent a shift from fighting against divorce to promoting marriage and traditional family.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Speaking on behalf of the League in an 1887 address to the Evangelical Alliance Conference, Samuel Dike described the ideal family as having "one man and one woman, united in wedlock, together with their children".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This movement built the foundation for many pro-family arguments in contemporary antifeminism.

=== Early 20th century ===
Women's suffrage was achieved in 1920, and early 20th century antifeminism was primarily focused on fighting this. Suffragists scoffed at antisuffragists. [[Anna Howard Shaw]], president of the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) from 1904 to 1915, presumed, perhaps unfairly, that the antisuffragists were merely working under the influence of male forces.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Thurner | first = Manuela | title = "Better citizens without the ballot": American antisuffrage women and their rationale during the progressive era | journal = [[Journal of Women's History]] | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 33&amp;ndash;60 | doi = 10.1353/jowh.2010.0279 | date = Spring 1993 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later historians tended to dismiss antisuffragists as subscribing to the model of domestic idealism, that a woman's place is in the home. This undermines and belittles the true power and numbers behind the antisuffrage movement, which was primarily led by women themselves.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Arguments employed by antisuffragists at the turn of the century had less to do with a woman's place in the home as much as it had to do with a woman's proper place in the public realm. In fact, leaders of the movement often encouraged other women to leave the home and participate in society.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; What they opposed was women participating in the political sphere.

There were two reasons antisuffragists opposed women participating in the political realm. Some argued that women were already overburdened. The majority of them, however, argued that a woman's participation in the political realm would hinder her participation in social and civic duties. If they won the right to vote, women would consequently have to align with a particular party, which would destroy her ability to be politically neutral. Antisuffragists feared this would, in fact, hinder their influence with legislative authorities.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Mid 20th century ===
In 1951, two journalists published ''Washington Confidential.'' The novel claimed that Communist leaders used their men and women to recruit a variety of minorities in the nation's capital, such as females, colored males, and homosexual males. The vast popularity of the book caused such a buzz that the [[United States Civil Service Commission|Civil Service Commission]] had to create a "publicity campaign to improve the image of federal employees"&lt;ref name="Storrs"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Storrs | first = Landon R.Y. | title = Attacking the Washington "Femmocracy": antifeminism in the Cold War Campaign against "Communists in Government" | journal = [[Feminist Studies]] | volume = 33 | issue = 1 | pages = 118–152 | doi = 10.2307/20459124 | jstor = 20459124 | date = Spring 2007  | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; in hopes to save their federal employees from losing their jobs. This ploy failed once the journalists linked feminism to communism in their novel and ultimately reinforced antifeminism by implying that defending the "white, Christian, heterosexual, patriarchal family" was the only way to oppose communism.&lt;ref name=Storrs /&gt;

=== Late 20th century ===

==== Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) ====
The [[Equal Rights Amendment]] is a perennially proposed amendment to the [[United States Constitution]] that would grant equal rights and opportunities to every citizen of the United States, regardless of his or her sex. In 1950 and 1953, ERA was passed by the Senate with a provision known as "the Hayden rider", making it unacceptable to ERA supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Paul| first = Alice (November 1972 and May 1973)|title=Conversations with Alice Paul: Woman Suffrage and the Equal Rights Amendment (''interview with Amelia R.

Does it matter how the Equal Rights Amendment is worded?|website=jofreeman.com | date = June 1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hayden rider was included to keep special protections for women. A new section to the ERA was added, stating: "The provisions of this article shall not be construed to impair any rights, benefits, or exemptions now or hereafter conferred by law upon persons of the female sex." That is, women could keep their existing and future special protections that men did not have. By 1972, the amendment was supported by both major parties and was immensely popular. However, it was defeated in Congress when it failed to get the vote of thirty-eight legislatures by 1982.&lt;ref name="Burris"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Burris | first = Val | title = Who opposed the ERA? An analysis of the social bases of antifeminism | journal = [[Social Science Quarterly]] | volume = 64 | issue = 2 | pages = 305&amp;ndash;317 | date = June 1983 | jstor = 42874034 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of an unaltered ERA rejected the Hayden rider, believing an ERA containing the rider did not provide for equality.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Cynthia Ellen (1989), "[https://books.google.com/books?id=AXlSB6-WpKUC&amp;pg=PA31 "Reasonable distinctions": an alternative to the ERA]", in {{cite book |editor-last= Harrison | editor-first = Cynthia Ellen|title= On Account of Sex: The Politics of Women's Issues, 1945–1968 |publisher=University of California Press| location = Berkeley|pages=31&amp;ndash;32|isbn=9780520061217| year = 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jerome Himmelstein identified two main theories about the appeal of antifeminism and its role in opposition to the ERA. One theory is that it was a clash between upper-class liberal voters and the older, more conservative lower-class rural voters who often serve as the center for right-wing movements; in other words, this theory identifies particular social classes as more inherently friendly to antifeminism. Another theory holds that women who feel vulnerable and dependent on men are likely to oppose anything that threatens that tenuous stability; under this view, while educated, independent career women may support feminism, housewives who lack such resources are more drawn to antifeminism. Himmelstein, however, says both views are at least partially wrong, arguing that the primary dividing line between feminists and antifeminists is cultural rather than stemming from differences in economic and social status.&lt;ref name=Himmelstein&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Himmelstein | first = Jerome | title = The social basis of antifeminism: Religious networks and culture | journal = [[Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion]] | volume = 25 | issue = 1 | pages = 1&amp;ndash;15 | doi = 10.2307/1386059 | jstor = 1386059 | date = March 1986 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are, in fact, similarities between income between activists on both sides of the ERA debate. As it turned out, the most indicative factors when predicting ERA position, especially among women, were race, marital status, age, and education.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Marshall | first = Susan E. | title = Who speaks for American Women?

Val Burris, meanwhile, says that high-income men opposed the amendment because they would gain the least with it being passed; that those men had the most to lose, since the ratification of the ERA would mean more competition for their jobs and possibly a lowered self-esteem.&lt;ref name=Burris /&gt; Because of the support of antifeminism from conservatives and the constant "conservative reactions to liberal social politics", such as the New Deal attacks, the attack on the ERA has been called a "right-wing backlash".&lt;ref name=Burris /&gt; Their methods include actions such as "insults proffered in emails or on the telephone, systematic denigration of feminism in the media, Internet disclosure of confidential information (e.g. addresses) on resources for battered women"&lt;ref name="Blais &amp; Dupuis-Déri" /&gt; and more.

==== Abortion ====
Abortion remains one of the most controversial topics in the United States. ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' was passed in 1973, and abortion was utilized by many antifeminists to rally supporters. [[Anti-abortion movements|Antiabortion views]] helped further several right-wing movements, including explicit antifeminism, and helped right-wing politicians rise to power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pollack Petchesky|first=Rosalind | title = Antiabortion, antifeminism, and the rise of the new right | journal = [[Feminist Studies]] | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 206&amp;ndash;246 | doi = 10.2307/3177522| date = Summer 1981 | ref = harv | postscript = .|jstor=3177522 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Joffe|first=Carole|title=Abortion and antifeminism|journal= [[Politics &amp; Society]] | volume=15|issue=2|pages=207&amp;ndash;211 |doi=10.1177/003232928701500206 | date = June 1987 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antiabortion writings, as well as conservative commentary in the late 20th century criticized the selfishness and self-centeredness of the feminist movement regarding abortions.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Some current antifeminist practices can be traced back to the rise of the religious right in the late 1970s.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  [[BBC]] and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', among others, have covered the 2014 social media trend [[Women Against Feminism|#WomenAgainstFeminism]].

In response to the social media trend, modern day feminists also began to upload similar pictures to websites such as Twitter and Tumblr.

== Organizations ==
[[File:STOP ERA.gif|thumb|Symbol used for signs and buttons by ERA opponents]]

Founded in the U.S. by [[Phyllis Schlafly]] in 1972, Stop ERA, now known as "[[Eagle Forum]]", lobbied successfully to block the passage of the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] in the U.S.&lt;ref name="wse2"&gt;Tierney, Helen (1999), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DkPFL6XcKeQC&amp;pg=PA95 Antifeminist movements]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Tierney | editor-first = Helen | title = Women's studies encyclopedia: A–F | page=95 | publisher = Greenwood Press | location = Westport, Connecticut | year = 1999 | isbn = 9780861721122 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also Schlafly who forged links between Stop ERA and other conservative organizations, as well as single-issue groups against abortion, pornography, gun control, and unions. By integrating Stop ERA with the thus-dubbed "[[new right]]", she was able to leverage a wider range of technological, organizational and political resources, successfully targeting pro-feminist candidates for defeat.&lt;ref name="wse2" /&gt;

In India, the [[Save Indian Family Foundation]] is an antifeminist organization&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Basu | first = Srimati | title = Playing off courts: the negotiation of divorce and violence in plural legal settings in Kolkata | journal = [[Journal of Legal Pluralism|The Journal of Legal Pluralism and Unofficial Law]] | volume = 38 | issue = 52 | pages = 41&amp;ndash;75 | doi = 10.1080/07329113.2006.10756591 | date = 2006 | ref = harv | postscript = .| citeseerx = 10.1.1.485.7052 }}&lt;/ref&gt; opposed to a number of laws that they claim to have been used against men.&lt;ref&gt;Kulkarni, Mangesh (2014), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FAxWAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA65 Critical masculinity studies in India]", in {{cite book | editor-last1 = Dasgupta | editor-first1 = Rohit K. | editor-last2 = Gokulsing | editor-first2 = K.

The [[Concerned Women for America|Concerned Women of America (CWA)]] are also an antifeminist organization. Like other conservative women's groups, they oppose [[abortion]] and [[same-sex marriage]] and make appeals for maternalism and biological differences between women and men.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite book | last = Schreiber | first = Ronnee | title = Righting feminism: conservative women and American politics | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 2008 | isbn = 9780195331813 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schreiber|first=Ronnee | title = Injecting a woman's voice: Conservative women's organizations, gender consciousness, and the expression of women's policy preferences | journal = [[Sex Roles (journal)|Sex Roles]] | volume = 47 | issue = 7&amp;ndash;8 | pages = 331&amp;ndash;341 | doi = 10.1023/A:1021479030885 | date = October 2002 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Independent Women's Forum]] (IWF) is another antifeminist, conservative, women-oriented group. It's younger and less established than the CWA, though the two organizations are often discussed in relation to each other. It was founded to take on the "old feminist establishment".&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Both of these organizations pride themselves on rallying women who do not identify with [[feminist rhetoric]] together. These organizations frame themselves as being by women, for women, in order to fight the idea that feminism is the only women-oriented ideology. These organizations chastise feminists for presuming to universally speak for all women. The IWF claims to be "the voice of ''reasonable'' women with important ideas who embrace common sense over divisive ideology".&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The [[alt-right]] movement is antifeminist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stack|first=Liam|title=Alt-right, alt-left, antifa: a glossary of extremist language|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/15/us/politics/alt-left-alt-right-glossary.html|date=15 August 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date = 26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasoning==
According to [[Amherst College]] sociology professor Jerome L. Himmelstein, antifeminism is rooted in social stigmas against feminism and is thus a purely reactionary movement. Himmelstein identifies two prevailing theories that seek to explain the origins of antifeminism: the first theory, proposed by Himmelstein, is that conservative opposition in the [[abortion]] and [[Equal Rights Amendment]] (ERA) debates has created a climate of hostility toward the entire feminist movement.&lt;ref name="Himmelstein" /&gt; The second theory Himmelstein identifies states that the female antifeminists who lead the movement are largely married, low education, and low personal income women who embody the "insecure housewife scenario" and seek to perpetuate their own situation in which women depend on men for fiscal support. However, numerous studies have failed to correlate the aforementioned demographic factors with support for antifeminism, and only religiosity correlates positively with antifeminist alignment.&lt;ref name="Himmelstein" /&gt; Thus, Himmelstein concludes that antifeminism is a conservative religious reaction against the progress of modern feminism.

Authors Janet Saltzman Chafetz and Anthony Gary Dworkin, writing for ''[[Gender &amp; Society|Gender and Society]]'', argue that the organizations most likely to formally organize against feminism are religious. This is because women's movements may demand access to male-dominated positions within the religious sector, like the clergy, and women's movements threaten male-oriented values of some religions.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The more successful a feminist movement is in challenging the authority of male-dominated groups, the more these groups will organize a countermovement.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[University of Illinois at Chicago]] sociology professor Danielle Giffort argues that the stigma against feminism created by antifeminists has resulted in organizations that practice "implicit feminism", which she defines as the "strategy practiced by feminist activists within organizations that are operating in an anti- and [[Postfeminism|post-feminist]] environment in which they conceal feminist identities and ideas while emphasizing the more socially acceptable angles of their efforts".&lt;ref name=Giffort&gt;{{cite journal | last = Giffort | first = Danielle M. | title = Show or tell?

Thus, most women continue to practice feminism in terms of seeking equality and independence for women, yet avoid the label.&lt;ref name=Giffort /&gt;

==Motivations==
Antifeminism might be motivated by the belief that feminist theories of [[patriarchy]] and disadvantages suffered by women in society are incorrect or exaggerated;&lt;ref name="flood" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt; that feminism as a movement encourages [[misandry]] and results in harm or oppression of men; or driven by general opposition towards [[women's rights]].&lt;ref name="Kimmel" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blee, Kathleen M.

*"The two major waves of antifeminist activity coincide with the two waves of the women's rights movement: the campaign to secure female suffrage in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and the feminist movement of the late twentieth century. In both periods, those holding a traditional view of women's place in the home and family tried to advance their cause by joining with other conservative groups to forestall efforts to extend women's rights."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mertz, Thomas J. (2005), "[https://archive.org/stream/NewDictionaryOfTheHistoryOfIdeas/New%20Dictionary%20of%20the%20History%20of%20Ideas%202005_djvu.txt Antifeminism]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Cline Horowitz | editor-first = Maryanne | title = New dictionary of the history of ideas / Vol. 1, Abolitionism to Common sense | pages = 94&amp;ndash;98 | publisher = Charles Scribner's Sons | location = New York | year = 2005 | isbn = 9780684313788 }}
*"Antifeminism, then, repudiates critiques of male supremacy and resists efforts to eliminate it (often accompanied by dismissal of the idea that change is possible). Note that this definition of antifeminism limits its reference to reactions against critiques of gender-based hierarchies and efforts to relieve the oppression of women."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howard, Angela Marie (2008), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EFI7tr9XK6EC&amp;pg=PA115 Antifeminism]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Smith | editor-first = Bonnie G. | title = The Oxford encyclopedia of women in world history / Vol. 1, Abayomi to Czech Republic | pages = 115&amp;ndash;119 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford England New York | isbn = 9780195148909 | year = 2008 }}
*"Reform activity that challenged either the subordination of women to men or the patriarchal limitation of women's status provoked an antifeminist response that included an intellectual and political campaign to halt progress toward women's rights and equality."&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study of 126 American students, antifeminist men were found to value their own power more than nonfeminist or feminist men did. Antifeminist women were not found to have the same difference from other women, suggesting some men may oppose feminism because they fear losing their power or sense of power in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nelson |first= Lori J. |last2=Shanahan |first2=Sandra B. |last3=Olivetti |first3=Jennifer | title = Power, empowerment, and equality: evidence for the motives of feminists, nonfeminists, and antifeminists | journal = [[Sex Roles (journal)|Sex Roles]] | volume = 37 | issue = 3&amp;ndash;4 | pages = 227&amp;ndash;247 | doi = 10.1023/A:1025699828057 | date = August 1997 | ref = harv | quote = "Men may focus on feminism as an issue of power simply because of the position they have traditionally held in society.

"[https://news.artnet.com/market/art-loss-register-embroiled-least-three-international-art-disputes-305134 The Art Loss Register is Entangled in Three Major International Art Disputes]". ''artnet Magazine'', June 5, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; A computerized international database that captures information about lost and stolen art, antiques, and collectables, the ALR is a London-based, independent, for profit corporate offspring of the New York-based, nonprofit [[International Foundation for Art Research]] (IFAR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifar.org/home.php|title=International Foundation for Art Research (IFAR)-IFAR Home Page|website=www.ifar.org|accessdate=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The range of functions served by ALR has grown as the number of its listed items has increased. The database is used by collectors, the art trade, insurers, and law enforcement agencies worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artloss.com/content/home Art Loss Register] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100501083655/http://www.artloss.com/content/home |date=May 1, 2010 }}: [http://www.artloss.com/content/history-and-business History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100525120830/http://www.artloss.com/content/history-and-business |date=May 25, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1991, IFAR helped create the Art Loss Register (ALR) as a commercial enterprise to expand and market the database. IFAR managed ALR's U.S. operations through 1997. In 1998 the ALR assumed full responsibility for the IFAR database although IFAR retains ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ifar.org/about.php|title=IFAR Retains Ownership of Art Loss Database|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, the database comprised only 20,000 items, but it grew in size nearly tenfold during its first decade.&lt;ref&gt;Houpt, Simon. (2006). ''Museum of the Missing, p. 8.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Houpt, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first steps towards ALR began with the establishment of IFAR in New York in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Glueck, Grace. [https://www.nytimes.com/1970/05/08/archives/art-group-is-set-up-to-judge-attribution.html?sq=international%2520foundatin%2520for%2520art%2520research&amp;scp=13&amp;st=cse   "Art Group Is Set Up To Judge Attribution,"] ''New York Times.'' May 8, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among other explicit goals, IFAR was created to compile information about stolen art.&lt;ref name="yarrow"&gt;Yarrow, Andrew L. [https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/20/arts/a-lucrative-crime-grows-into-a-costly-epidemic.html?scp=10&amp;sq=international%20foundatin%20for%20art%20research&amp;st=cse  "A Lucrative Crime Grows Into a Costly Epidemic,"] ''New York Times.'' March 20, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the growth of international art thefts, IFAR began publishing the "Stolen Art Alert" in 1976.

By 1990, IFAR was updating its catalogue of stolen art 10 times a year.&lt;ref name="yarrow"/&gt;  The magnitude of the problem overwhelmed what had grown to be over 20,000 manual records. While IFAR had been very successful in recording the details of losses, that was only a good first step.

In 1991, the ALR was established in London as a commercial company, earning fees from insurers and theft victims. Its founding shareholders included insurance and auction houses, which some think is a conflict of interest [[Christie's#cite note-72]]. The majority of shares are owned by its founder, [[Julian Radcliffe]].&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/21/arts/design/tracking-stolen-art-for-profit-and-blurring-a-few-lines.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=0 Tracking Stolen Art, for Profit, and Blurring a Few Lines, ''New York Times'', September 20, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; Significant capital investment was needed so that IFAR could be computerised and so that the database made available to worldwide law enforcement agencies and others.  

==Development==
In response to the growth and development of IFAR, museum officials revised some policies based on an assumption that discussing theft would scare away potential donors. The AFR initially formed a partnership with the ALR, but, they later split after disagreements over strategy and issues of control.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; The change from policies of secrecy to ones which emphasize openness was gradual, mirroring an expectation that publicizing theft is likely to promote recovery.&lt;ref name="yarrow"/&gt; The ALR has been widely criticised for its methods and for the actions of its chairman, [[Julian Radcliffe]]. The Register has consistently lost money but for the personal cash infusions of its chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://chasingaphrodite.com/2013/08/01/optical-due-diligence-art-loss-register-claims-to-vet-ancient-art-does-it/|title=Art Loss Register Claims to Vet Ancient Art, Does it?|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The approach adopted by the ALR has been criticised. The Register has contacted owners of stolen art saying it had information, but not revealing it until a fee was paid. In another instance the ALR lied to Sotheby’s saying that paintings were not stolen. The paintings were then shipped to London, where they were seized.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; The ALR has likened this approach to the police misleading a suspect during an investigation.

The major [[effects of the automobile on societies]] include the development of diverse customs and [[tradition]]s.
[[Image:Januaristormens förödelse.jpg|right|thumb|180px|Car accident omen]]

Some drivers believe that a new car is in greater danger than a used car of getting into an accident or having a collision.{{why|date=April 2018}} Some drivers will leave change under their seats. Others use one coin to scratch the car, based on the (false) belief that since the car is new and nothing has happened to it yet, the chances of something bad happening to the car is greater when compared to a used car which already has its fair share of dents and scratches. In hopes of preventing a high damaging accident, they will place a small nick or scratch on the car in an area where it will not be seen. The inside of the wheel well is one commonly scratched area.{{cnl|date=April 2018}}

There are also a few practices associated with graduations. In the days leading up to a graduation, some drivers (and in some cases friends of the driver) will write on the car windows with washable paint. The messages usually congratulate the driver of the car and list the driver’s school and year of graduation. After graduating from high school or college, some drivers choose to hang their tassel from the rearview mirror.{{cnl|date=April 2018}}

Some people throw change under a bed in hopes of bringing good luck to the new home. Change is known world wide as a good luck charm.{{cnl|date=April 2018}}
[[Image:Mourning Car.jpg|right|thumb|180px|Mourning Car decked with flags]]

==Religious==

There are also religious acts that are associated with automobiles. This can include getting the car blessed by a cleric or placing an object of religious significance inside the car.

A predominately [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] practice is to place a medal of [[Saint Christopher]], the patron saint of truck drivers and travelers in general,&lt;ref&gt;[http://saints.sqpn.com/saint-christopher/ ''“Saint Christopher“''] Saints.SQPN.com. (Accessed 20/12/14)&lt;/ref&gt; inside the car.  Usually, the driver will have this medal blessed by a priest.  An ancient legend, mentioned by [[Erasmus]] in the ''[[Praise of Folly]]'', holds that those who see an image of Saint Christopher cannot die through misadventure during that day.  Not surprisingly,  images of Saint Christopher became popular automobile accessories.  Through the presence of the medal, the driver is asking the Saint to pray on his or her behalf for a safe and uneventful journey.

A somewhat more sombre purpose originally stood behind the familiar [[Depiction of Jesus|plastic Jesus]] that some Christians have mounted on their dashboards.  The original plastic Jesus was circulated by the [[Sacred Heart Auto League]], founded in 1955 by Father Gregory Bezy, [[Priests of the Sacred Heart|SCJ]].  This devotional society placed the traditional Roman Catholic figure of Jesus displaying his [[Sacred Heart]] on the dashboard.  Father Bezy was moved to do this as a "practical answer to what he considered the ever-increasing dangers of our overcrowded streets and highways."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shl.org/site/PageServer?pagename=AutoLeague&amp;JServSessionIdr005=5jpwoj3pk1.app2a Sacred Heart Auto League], official site. (Accessed 8/12/06)&lt;/ref&gt;  In other words, in the event of a fatal accident, Father Bezy hoped that the last thing the riders would see would be the image of Jesus, and as such face Eternity with faith and contrition.

The plastic dashboard Jesus proved popular among non-Catholic Christians as well.  The figure is well known enough to have inspired a [[folk song]] ''Plastic Jesus'', originally attributed to [[Ed Rush]] and [[George Cromarty]], which has acquired many anonymous folk variants.  One frequent set of verses has it open:

:''I don't care if it rains or freezes&lt;br&gt;Long as I got my Plastic Jesus&lt;br&gt;Riding on the dashboard of my car.''
:''Through my trials and tribulations&lt;br&gt;And my travels through the nations&lt;br&gt;With my Plastic Jesus I'll go far.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guntheranderson.com/v/data/plastic0.htm ''Plastic Jesus''] lyrics and chords. (Accessed 8/12/06)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Catholics will also hang [[rosary beads]] from their rearview mirror.

Catholics and other Christians may also hang crosses or [[crucifix]]es from the rearview mirror.

==Cars for special occasions==
[[Image:Cadillac Fleetwood Wedding.jpg|right|thumb|180px|Wedding Transport]]
Cars are often decorated, and have wishes written on them, and various streamers or trailing objects attached, in celebrations of [[wedding]]s and [[graduation]]s.

[[Image:Cadillac Fleetwood hearse 1990s.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Hearse]]
[[Image:Limosin vid Keybar - Avenyn - i Göteborg, 11 aug 2006.JPG|right|thumb|180px|Limousine]]
A frequent [[wedding tradition]] in the United States involves the decoration of the vehicle the bride and groom drive take at the conclusion of the wedding ceremony.  Typically, various ribbons and streamers are attached, and words written upon the surface of the vehicle, and often [[tin can]]s are attached to its fenders or bumpers by strings to serve as noisemakers.  [[Jan Brunvand]]'s ''American Folklore: An Encyclopedia'' speculates that the decoration of the car and its equipment with noisemakers may perpetuate the [[Charivari|shivaree]], a custom in which newlyweds were given a noisy serenade; when [[honeymoon]] travel became a custom, it made a traditional local shivaree impractical, so the vehicle is given a noisy sendoff instead.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Brunvand, ''American Folklore: An Encyclopedia'' (Garland, 1988) {{ISBN|0-8153-3350-1}}. ("Weddings")&lt;/ref&gt;

Some cars are used chiefly for special occasions and social rituals, such as [[limousines]].

==Truck drivers and taxicab drivers==
[[Image:LKWs.gif|left|thumb|180px|Trucks and Truck Drivers]]
[[Image:CB-Handfunkgeraet.jpg|right|thumb|180px|CB Radio]]
Various professions revolving around motor vehicles acquire a folklore of their own.  [[Truck driver]]s, since they tend to work in isolation, tend to develop a social network of their own.  They circulate a number of [[tall tale]]s that relate generally to their profession, usually involving the outwitting of [[state police]] and other traffic or tax authorities.  They also create an elaborate body of customs and lore surrounding the use of [[citizen's band radio]], with its own jargon and "[[pseudonym|handles]]", which came to national notice in the 1970s.  A widespread bit of popular folklore circulated among other motorists that truck drivers knew which [[restaurant]]s to patronize and which to avoid, so eateries that were obviously frequented by truck drivers were esteemed by the general public.  With the arise of national restaurant chains, this bit of folklore is fading.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Brunvand, ''American Folklore: An Encyclopedia'' (Garland, 1988) {{ISBN|0-8153-3350-1}}. ("Truck drivers")&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar folklore surrounds [[taxicab]] drivers, involving the tales they tell among each other, and the tales that circulate about them.
[[Image:Checker.jpg|right|thumb|180px|Taxicab]]

==Car coining==

There is a practice in New Jersey and New York of tossing a few coins onto the floor of a newly purchased car as a sign of good luck. This practice originated as a practical one.  Because of the area's many toll roads, many drivers would carry change in their cars.  The friends and family of the new car owner would throw coins onto the floor of the new car so if the driver ever ran out of his own money, he could always reach down and find some extra money on the floor.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.churchill.com/car-insurance/tips/driving-rituals&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[ancient Egypt]]ians regarded beauty as a sign of holiness. Everything the ancient Egyptians used had a spiritual aspect to it, including cosmetics. Traders traded makeup often, especially in the upper classes. In tombs, cosmetic palettes were found buried with the deceased as grave goods which further emphasized the idea that cosmetics were not only used for aesthetic purposes but rather [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] and [[religious]] purposes.

==Chemistry of ancient Egyptian cosmetics==

The two main forms of eye makeup were grepond eye paint and black [[Kohl (cosmetics)|kohl]]. The green eye paint was made of [[malachite]], a copper carbonate pigment, and the black kohl was made from [[galena]], a dark grey [[ore]]. Crushed charcoal was also used in this process. Mesdemet or Kohl was used for lining the eyes and were revealed to bring along potent health benefits in the form of protection from disease, bugs and sun rays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://makeupandbeautyguides.com/create-an-alluring-look-with-egyptian-eye-makeup-tricks/|title=Egyptian Eye Makeup}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medical uses of ancient Egyptian cosmetics ==

The ancient Egyptians were not entirely misguided in believing that kohl would prevent eye infections because it actually did help to prevent bacterial infections [http://www.revoptom.com/content/d/news_review/i/1018/c/19409/ ocular infection] associated with flood waters from the [[Nile]]. The lead-based substances in the kohl promoted the production of [[nitric oxide]] in their skin, which helped strengthen their [[immune systems]] against diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.revoptom.com/content/d/news_review/i/1018/c/19409/|title=How the Pharaohs Fought Ocular Infection|last=Staff|access-date=2018-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[soot]] in kohl helped in reducing the damaging effects of sun glare on their eyes. The ancient Egyptians created a remedy for burns by mixing the cheek and lip stain and other remedies for improving skin with red natron, northern salt and [[honey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sacred Luxuries|last=Manniche|first=Lise|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1999|isbn=|location=New York|pages=134, 138}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ancient Egyptians strongly believed that the healing effects of these cosmetics were magical rather than medical.

== Cosmetic palettes and jars ==

Cosmetics palettes were used to grind makeup. The earliest examples were rectangular in shape and date back to 5000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/s-OMbtkESJ6aV6_k6o86oA|title=BBC - A History of the World - Object : Cosmetic Palette|website=www.bbc.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The palettes later adopted a rounder shape like the [http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/narmerspalette.htm Narmer palette]. [[Narmer Palette|King Narmer’s palette]] was the earliest piece of its kind. It has decorations of the King smiting the enemies of Egypt and the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt, as well as a cavity for the grinding of cosmetics, making it a double purposed palette. These later developed into fish shaped palettes. They might have chosen the fish shape as the fish was a symbol of resurrection and new life. The fish shaped palettes were usually adorned with precious stones for royalty. These palettes have developed into [http://www.egyptianmyths.net/baboon.htm baboon shaped containers] to hold the kohl which held symbolic meanings for the ancient Egyptians.

== Use of cosmetics in different social classes  ==
The use of cosmetics in Egypt varied slightly between social classes, where more make-up was worn by higher class individuals as wealthier individuals could afford more cosmetics. Although there was no prominent difference between the make-up styles of the upper and lower class, noble women were known to pale their skin using creams and powders. This was due to pale skin being a sign of nobility as lighter skin meant less exposure to the sun whereas dark skin was associated with the lower class who tanned while taking part in menial labor such as working in the fields. Thus, paler skin represented the non-working noble class, as noble women would not work in the sun.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyembalmed.org/ancient-egyptian-makeup.htm|title=Ancient Egyptian Makeup|last=|first=|date=|website=historyembalmed.org|publisher=|access-date=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bloviation''' is a style of empty, pompous political speech popularized by United States President [[Warren G. Harding]], who, himself a master of the technique, described it as "the art of speaking for as long as the occasion warrants, and saying nothing".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= The American Past: A Survey of American History |first=Joseph R. | last=Conlin |authorlink = Joseph R.

In terms of its etymology, according to one source, the word is a "compound of blow, in its sense of 'to boast' (also in another typical Americanism, ''blowhard''), with a mock-[[Latin]] ending to give it the self-important stature implicit in its meaning."&lt;ref name="quinion"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/weirdwords/ww-blo1.htm|title= Bloviate|authorlink=Michael Quinion|first=Michael |last=Quinion|year=1999|publisher=[[World Wide Words]]|accessdate=January 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cascading strings''' (also sometimes known as "tumbling strings") is an arrangement technique of British [[light music]]. This technique is associated in the U.S. with the style of [[easy listening]] known as [[beautiful music]]. The cascading strings effect was first developed by British composer/arranger [[Ronald Binge]], but most associated with [[Annunzio Paolo Mantovani]] and his Mantovani Orchestra. 

U.S. Record producers [[Hugo and Luigi]] also did a series of recordings under the name "Cascading Voices" and later "Cascading Strings."

One effect of the cascading strings technique is to emulate the acoustic properties of a large hall such as a [[cathedral]], through simulated [[reverberation]]. The effect is achieved in an [[orchestra]] using multiple [[string section]]s, which would play slightly different parts from one another, in a cascading effect, thus creating the  illusion of reverberation of the original sound.

'''Cliché verre''' is a combination of painting and or drawing, with photography.  In brief, it is a method of either etching, painting or drawing on a transparent surface, such as glass, thin paper or film and printing the resulting image on a light sensitive paper in a photographic darkroom. It is a process first practiced by a number of French painters during the early 19th century.  The French landscape painter [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]] was the best known of these. Some contemporary artists have developed techniques for achieving a variety of line, tone, texture and color by experimenting with film, frosted [[BoPET|Mylar]], paint and inks and a wide assortment of tools for painting, etching, scratching, rubbing and daubing. Scratching a negative is another form of cliche verre. Many ways to get different designs for a cliche verre is to print a design off of the computer onto transparent paper. Or even scan a photo onto transparent paper and alter it that way before exposing it. 

''Cliché verre'' is French. ''[[Cliché]]'' is a printing term: a printing plate cast from movable type; while ''verre'' means glass.

Cliché verre was one of the earliest forms of reproducing images before the advent of the camera. As a precursor to photography, cliché verre could accurately represent the original scene without the tonal variations available in modern day photography.

[[File:Commode.jpg|thumb|Commode, veneered with [[Lacquer|Japanese lacquer]] and japanned, by [[Bernard II van Risenburgh]], Paris, c. 1750-60 [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]&lt;ref&gt;V&amp;A Museum no. 1094-1882&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:François-Gaspard Teuné - Commode with Urns and Flowers - Walters 6565.jpg|thumb|A Neoclassical Parisian [[marquetry]] commode of mid-1770s, showing vestiges of the [[Rococo]] in the stiffened [[cabriole leg]]s and softened transitions between planes ([[Walters Art Museum]])]]

A '''commode''' is any of several pieces of [[furniture]]. The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' has multiple meanings of "commode". The first relevant definition reads: "A piece of furniture with drawers and shelves; in the bedroom, a sort of elaborate chest of drawers (so in French); in the drawingroom, a large (and gen.[erally] old-fashioned) kind of chiffonier." The [[drawing room]] is itself an old-fashioned term for a formal reception room, and a [[Chiffonier#British chiffonier|chiffonier]] is, in this sense, a small [[sideboard]] dating from the early 19th century.

Another meaning attested is a [[washstand]], a piece of furniture equipped with basin, jug, and towel rail, and often with space to store the [[chamber pot]] behind closed doors. A washstand in the bedroom pre-dates indoor bathrooms and running water.

In [[British English]], "commode" is the standard term for a [[commode chair]], often on wheels, enclosing a [[chamber pot]]—as used in hospitals and the homes of invalids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cambridge Dictionaries online, entry for Commode|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/commode?q=commode|accessdate=20 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, a "commode" is a colloquial synonym for a [[flush toilet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/toto-neorest-750h-toilet-review-and-photos-2017-5|title=I tried the 'Mercedes Benz of toilets' that comes with a remote control and costs $10,200|work=[[Business Insider]]|first=Melia |last=Robinson |date=June 1, 2017|access-date=23 November 2017|quote=...But Japan's biggest toilet maker has brought these high-tech features and more to its premiere line of commodes.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''commode'' comes from the [[French language|French]] word for "convenient" or "suitable", which in turn comes from the Latin adjective ''commodus'', with similar meanings.

==History and types==

===France===
The term originates in the vocabulary of [[French furniture]] from about 1700. At that time, a ''commode'' meant a [[Cabinet (furniture)|cabinet]] or [[chest of drawers]], low enough so that it sat at the height of the [[dado rail]] (''à hauteur d'appui''). It was a piece of [[Wood veneer|veneer]]ed [[casegoods|case furniture]] much wider than it was high, raised on high or low legs.&lt;ref&gt;A commode with a divided drawer above two deep ones was a ''commode en tombeau''— a "monumental commode"— or, in retrospect, a ''commode à la [[Régence]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Commodes were made by ''[[ébéniste]]s''; the French word for "[[cabinet-maker]]" is derived from [[ebony]], a black tropical [[hardwood]] notable as a foreign luxury. The beautiful wood was complemented with [[ormolu]] (gilt-bronze [[drawer pull]]s). The piece of furniture would be provided with a marble slab top&lt;ref&gt;The slab might be veneered with a fine or rare marble, such as a [[breccia]]; its edges might be [[molding (decorative)|moulded]].&lt;/ref&gt; selected to match the marble of the [[chimneypiece]].

A commode occupied a prominent position in the room for which it was intended: it stood against the [[pier (architecture)|pier]] between the windows,&lt;ref&gt;Such a piece, when made particularly shallow, not to impede passage along the ''[[enfilade]]'' that connected rooms might be called a ''demi-commode'' (Francis J. B. Watson, ''Louis XVI Furniture'' 1973, fig.fig. 27).&lt;/ref&gt; in which case it would often be surmounted by a mirror glass,&lt;ref&gt;"In a room with three windows, for instance, one could place between them a ''commode'' with drawers and one with drawers, while still preserving an essential symmetry." (Pierre Verlet, ''French Furniture and Interior Decoration of the 18th Century'', 1967) p. 154)&lt;/ref&gt; or a pair of identical commodes would flank the chimneypiece or occupy the center of each end wall.

''Bombé'' commodes, with surfaces shaped in three dimensions, were a feature of the [[rococo]] style called "[[Louis XV of france|Louis Quinze]]". Rectilinear neoclassical, or "[[Louis XVI of France|Louis Seize]]", commodes might have such deep drawers or doors that the feet were ''en toupie''—in the tapering [[Woodturning|turned shape]] of a child's [[Top|spinning top]]. Both rococo and neoclassical commodes might have cabinets flanking the main section, in which case such a piece was a ''commode à encoignures'';&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis J. B. Watson]], ''Louis XVI Furniture'' 1973,  illustrates as ''commodes à encoignures'' the commode by [[Gilles Joubert]] and [[Roger Vandercruse La Croix]], 1769 for Mme Victoire at [[Château de Compiègne|Compiègne]] (fig. 23 ([[Frick Collection]], New York); the commode by Joubert for Mme Adelaide at Versailles, 1769 (fig. 24, [[Getty Museum]], Los Angeles); the unusually rich and monumental commode by [[Jean-Henri Riesener]] for the king's bedroom at Versailles, 1775 (fig. 32, Musée Condé, Chantilly).&lt;/ref&gt; pairs of ''[[encoignure]]s'' or corner-cabinets might also be designed to complement a commode and stand in the flanking corners of a room. If a commode had open shelves flanking the main section it was a ''commode à l'anglaise''; if it did not have enclosing [[drawer (furniture)|drawers]] it was a ''commode à vantaux''.

Before the mid-eighteenth century the commode had become such a necessary article of furniture that it might be made in ''menuiserie'' (carpentry), of solid painted oak, walnut or fruitwoods, with carved decoration, typical of [[French provincial furniture]].

===England===
[[File:Commode, antique w pitcher.jpg|thumb|130px|upright|A [[washstand]] with pitcher (jug) and towel rack, sometimes known as a commode.]]

In the English-speaking world, ''commode''  passed into cabinet-makers' parlance [[18th-century London|in London by the mid-eighteenth century]] to describe [[chest of drawers|chests of drawers]] with gracefully curved fronts, and sometimes with shaped sides as well, perceived as being in the "French" taste. [[Thomas Chippendale]] employed the term "French Commode Tables" to describe designs in ''The Cabinet-Maker and Upholsterer's Director'' (1753), and [[Ince and Mayhew]] illustrated a "Commode Chest of drawers", plate xliii, in their ''Universal System of Household Furniture'', 1759–62. [[John Gloag]] notes&lt;ref&gt;Gloag, ''A Short Dictionary of Furniture'' , rev. ed. 1969, ''s.v.'' "Commode,  "Commode Front".&lt;/ref&gt; that ''Commode'' expanded to describe any piece of furniture with [[Serpentine shape|a serpentine front]], such as a [[dressing table]], or even a chair seat.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Magrath, a cabinet-maker and upholsterer in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], advertised for sale in 1771 ""Half a Dozen Caned Chairs, a Couch to match them, with commode fronts, and Pincushion seats." (Noted in Gloag, ''op. cit'', ''s.v.'' "Commode Front").&lt;/ref&gt; Gloag points out that [[Thomas Shearer]]'s designs for two "commode dressing chests" illustrated in ''The Cabinet-Makers' London Book of Prices'', 1788, plate 17, are repeated, but as "serpentine dressing chests", in ''The Prices of Cabinet Work'', 1797 edition.

==Toilet==
[[File:Toilet and commode collection (8634423921).jpg|thumb|Museum collection of toilets, bed pans, hip baths, etc. The modern toilet commode is on the right.]]
[[File:Commode, Europe, 1831-1900 Wellcome L0057869.jpg|thumb|19th century heavy wooden toilet commode]]

In [[British English]], "commode" is the standard term for a [[commode chair]], often on wheels, enclosing a [[chamber pot]]—as used in hospitals and the homes of invalids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cambridge Dictionaries online, entry for Commode|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/commode?q=commode|accessdate=20 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The historic equivalent is the [[close stool]], hence the coveted and prestigious position [[Groom of the Stool]] for a courtier close to the monarch.) This piece of furniture is termed in French a '''chaise percée''' ("pierced chair"); similar items were made specifically as moveable [[bidet]]s for washing.

In the United States, a "commode" is a colloquial synonym for a [[flush toilet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/toto-neorest-750h-toilet-review-and-photos-2017-5|title=I tried the 'Mercedes Benz of toilets' that comes with a remote control and costs $10,200|work=[[Business Insider]]|first=Melia |last=Robinson |date=June 1, 2017|access-date=23 November 2017|quote=...But Japan's biggest toilet maker has brought these high-tech features and more to its premiere line of commodes.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:009MA Kritios.jpg|thumb|''Kritios Boy''. c. 480 BCE, was the first known statue to use ''contrapposto''.]]
'''''Contrapposto''''' ({{IPA-it|kontrapˈposto}}) is an [[Italian language|Italian]] term that means counterpoise.  It is used in the [[visual arts]] to describe a human figure standing with most of its weight on one foot so that its shoulders and arms twist off-axis from the hips and legs. This gives the figure a more dynamic, or alternatively relaxed appearance.  It can also be used to refer to multiple figures which are in counter-pose (or opposite pose) to one another.  It can further encompass the tension as a figure changes from resting on a given leg to walking or running upon it (so-called ''ponderation''). The leg that carries the weight of the body is known as the ''engaged'' leg, the relaxed leg is known as the ''free'' leg.&lt;ref name=Janson&gt;[[H. W. Janson|Janson, H.W.]] (1995) ''History of Art''. 5th edn. Revised and expanded by Anthony F. Janson. London: [[Thames &amp; Hudson]], p. 139. {{ISBN|0500237018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrapposto is less emphasized than the more sinuous [[S Curve (art)|S Curve]], and creates the illusion of past and future movement.&lt;ref&gt;"Contrapposto". Grove Encyclopedia Of Materials &amp; Techniques In Art: 142–143. October 2008. {{ISBN|9780195313918}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrapposto was an extremely important sculptural development, for its appearance marks the first time in Western art that the human body is used to express a psychological disposition. The balanced, harmonious pose of the [[Kritios Boy]] suggests a calm and relaxed state of mind, an evenness of temperament that is part of the ideal of man represented. 
[[File:Etruscan Statuette.jpeg|thumb|[[Etruscan art|Etruscan]] statuette, from Italy, 3rd to 1st century BCE, bronze]]
From this point onwards Greek sculptors went on to explore how the body could convey the whole range of human experience, culminating in the desperate anguish and pathos of ''[[Laocoön and His Sons]]'' (1st century CE)  in the Hellenistic period.

==History==

===Classical===
The first known statue to use contrapposto is [[Kritios Boy]], c. 480 BC,&lt;ref name=HF&gt;[[Hugh Honour|Honour, H.]] and J. Fleming, (2009) ''A World History of Art''. 7th edn. London: Laurence King Publishing, p. 122. {{ISBN|9781856695848}}&lt;/ref&gt; so called because it was once attributed to the sculptor [[Kritios]]. It is possible, even likely, that earlier bronze statues had used the technique, but if they did, they have not survived and [[Kenneth Clark]] called the statue "the first beautiful nude in art".&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;Clark, Kenneth. (2010) ''The Nude: A study in ideal form''. New edition. London: [[The Folio Society]], pp. 24-25.&lt;/ref&gt; The statue is a Greek marble original and not a Roman copy.
 
Prior to the introduction of contrapposto, the statues that dominated ancient Greece were the [[Archaic Greece|archaic]] [[kouros]] (male) and the [[Kore (sculpture)|kore]] (female). Contrapposto has been used since the dawn of classical western sculpture. According to the ''canon'' of the Classical Greek [[Sculpture|Sculptor]] [[Polykleitos]] in the 4th century BC, it is one of the most important characteristics of his figurative works and those of his successors, [[Lysippos]], [[Skopas]], etc. The Polykletian statues – for example, [[Discophoros]] (''discus-bearer'') and [[Doryphoros]] (''spear-bearer'') – are idealized athletic young men with the divine sense, and captured in contrapposto. In these works, the pelvis is no longer [[Axial skeleton|axial]] with the [[Kouros|vertical statue as in the archaic style]] of earlier Greek sculpture before ''Kritios Boy''.

Contrapposto can be clearly seen in the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] copies of the statues of [[Hermes]] and [[Heracles]]. A famous example is [[Hermes and the Infant Dionysus|the marble statue]] of Hermes with the infant [[Dionysus]] in [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] by [[Praxiteles]]. It can also be seen in the Roman copies of Polyclitus's [[Amazons|Amazon]].

Greek art emphasized humanism along with the human mind and the human body's beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Greek Humanism|url = http://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/engl257/Ancient/greek_humanism.htm|website = www.webpages.uidaho.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greek youths trained and competed in athletic contests in the nude. A great contribution to the contrapposto pose was the concept of a canon of proportions, in which mathematical properties are used to create proportions.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley, Max (2010). "The 'Golden Canon' of book-page construction: proving the proportions geometrically". Journal of Mathematics &amp; The Arts. 4 no. 3: 137–141.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaissance===
Classical contrapposto was revived in the [[Renaissance]] by the Italian artists [[Donatello]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]], followed by [[Michelangelo]], [[Raphael]] and other artists of the [[High Renaissance]]. One of the major achievements of the [[Italian Renaissance]] was the re-discovery of contrapposto, although in [[Mannerism]] it became greatly over-used.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

===Modern times===
The technique continues to be widely employed in sculpture.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33400">The '''Culture of Basilan''' are derived from the three main cultural ethnolinguistic nations, the [[Yakan people|Yakan]], [[Tausūg people|Suluanon Tausug]] and the [[Zamboangueño people|Zamboangueño]] in the southern [[Philippines]]. Both Yakans and Tausugs are predominantly [[Muslim]], joined by their kin from the [[Sama-Bajau|Sama, Badjao]], [[Maranao people|Maranao]], and other Muslim ethnolinguistic groups of Mindanao, while the Zamboangueños are primarily [[Christian]], joined by the predominantly Christian ethnolinguistic groups; the [[Cebuano people|Cebuano]], [[Ilocano people|Ilocano]], [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]] and others. These three main groups, however, represent Basilan's tri-people or tri-ethnic group community.

==Yakan==
{{See also|Gantang (disambiguation)}}
[[File:Yakan.jpg|thumb|right|Wedding dance of a Yakan couple in their traditional costume.]]
The island is the homeland of the [[Yakan]]s, a [[Filipinos|Filipino]] ethnic group or ethnolinguistic group widely regarded as having been descended from Orang Dampuans (Orang Dyaks, Tagihamas) of the [[Kingdom of Champa]] and eastern [[Indonesia]], and recognized for their colorful costume.

The Yakan have designs or motifs used repeatedly in all their visual arts and crafts.  The ''pussuk labbung'' is a sawtooth design used for cloth baskets and the native sword called [[kris]]. The ''bunga sama'', used for table runners, monuments for the dead and on trunks, is a symmetrical design made of rectangular-shaped figures.  The ''kabban buddi'' is a set of triangles, squares, and other geometric shapes used for cushions, pillows, casings, mats, and hats.  The ''baggang kettan'' combines incised triangles and rectangles, and is used to decorate the kris. The ukil lagbas consists of a combination of various lines – wavy, crossed-wavy, and straight – used on shirts, windows of houses, and boats (Sherfan 1976:210–211).

Weapons such as knives and swords are part of the Yakan's visual arts. The ''punnyal'' is a small knife, which can be hidden within one's clothing.  The barong is carried with pride since it is a symbol of strength and is also acceptable as bride wealth. The taming is the traditional shield used along with two types of spears, the budjak and the sankil, now used only in war dances.  The bangkung is another type of bolo seldom used nowadays.  The pira is a traditional weapon used by little boys when going on a long journey.  The barong and the kris, although popular, are less valuable or admired among the Yakan  (Sherfan 1976:156–160).

Yakan visual arts includes Yakan kitchen utensils and household implements. Metalware includes the talam, a beautifully decorated bronze tray, and the sanduk or ladle used for special occasions.  Yakan basketry is both colorful and functional.  The tutop is a food cover made of bamboo leaves.  The peliyuk is a clay jar with cover used for cooking.  The baling is a decorative clay jar treasured as heirloom.  The kombo is a lidded container for rice storage.  A lakal is a bamboo frame used to hold the cooking gadget when placed on the ground.  The tempipih is a big basket carried on the back.  A conical basket called the saan is used as a liquid strainer.

Baskets are also used to measure and weigh.  The [[Gantang (Basilan)|gantang]] is bigger than the government ganta.  The batil measures nine gantang.  The laga is 10 gantang.  The ilug is 30 gantang.  The lukung is equivalent to 100 gantang.  An example of Yakan pottery is the poga, a covered clay jar used as water container (Sherfan 1976:201–204).

[[Image:Yakan cloth.jpg|thumb|right|Yakan cloth on display at the Isabela City Pasalubong Center and at the Lami-Lamihan Yakan Center in Lamitan, Basilan]]

Yakan women are excellent weavers, and are famous for their beautifully woven traditional costumes of cotton and pineapple cloth.  The basic garment for men and women consists of a tight-fitting upper garment with tight-fitting trousers called [[shawal|sawal]].  The shirt is open in front from lapel down to the waist, using up to 40 sequined or golden buttons.  To close the shirt, a long string is crisscrossed from one button to the other so that when tightly drawn, the shirt closes from top to bottom. Usually, the shirt remains open since the string is often lost.  Over the shirt, male and female wear a tight-fitting jacket, which is exquisitely embroidered in the front and back, with cuffs decorated with multicolored sequins.

The difference in male and female apparel lies in accessories. Men wear a hand-woven pis (head cloth) and a 15-m-long kandit (belt or sash) made of red cloth called gilim. The pis serves as "protection" from spears and knives during combat, and may be fastened around the trousers. The women wear a short skirt over the trousers, around which a rectangular, hand woven cloth is tied. This cloth is the most expensive part of their costume because it is woven in a tedious manner. Men and women wear the saruk, the Yakan hat worn to make one look more attractive and elegant. Some wear the hat over the turban and use it as a purse for betel nuts, tobacco, and money. Yakan warriors wear a bulletproof shirt prepared by hadjis and imams who write Arabic script all over the shirt (Sherfan 1976:160, 205–207).

Ornaments such as necklaces may be worn as charms. A crocodile tooth polished with a hole at the base is believed to bring good luck when worn as a necklace. The Yakan also wear amulets against bullets.  These contain unreadable symbols, are wrapped in black cloth, sewn in triangular form, and tied around the neck.  Belts made of snake bones are strung together to protect them against bodily pain. One charm that protects them from sicknesses due to evil spirits is the manik tegiyas – a necklace or bracelet made of the fruits of a flower beaded together.  The manik sembulan is made of a bamboo stem cut into short pieces, strung together either as a necklace or bracelet, and serving as added protection against sickness inflicted by evil spirits.  To gain more strength against evil spirits, men and women wear the anting-anting. This consists of a string with a piece of cloth containing beads as pendant (Sherfan 1976:143–147).

The Yakan also wear functional gadgets.  The pegupaan is a bamboo container for all the paraphernalia for chewing betel nut.  The lutuan, a small bronze box with engravings carried at the waist, has a similar function (Sherfan 1976:203).

A unique form of visual arts is the facial make-up done on brides and grooms.  After creating a foundation of white powder, the make-up artists proceed to paint dots and lines in various patterns on the faces, creating the effect of formal and elaborate masks which match the ornate costumes of the celebrants.

The Yakan have a rich musical tradition, which may be broadly divided into instrumental and vocal.  Yakan musical instruments are made of bamboo, wood, and metal.  Their musical instruments also demonstrate the influence of the traditional cycle of rice production in their lives.  Several instruments are used in each stage of rice production.  The daluppak is a digging stick with a [[bamboo clapper]].  The kopak-kopak is a bamboo clapper on a stick.  The [[Kulintang a kayo|Kwintangan Kayu]] is percussion instrument consisting of wooden beams laid after the planting season, to enhance plant growth.  The wooden tuntungan is a percussion plank with jar resonators, also played during the harvest season for thanksgiving.

The [[gabbang]] is a bamboo split into five, and arranged like a xylophone.  Small children near the fields played it in order to guard the crops against prying animals.  The kwintangan batakan is an earlier form of gabbang which has six, seven, or nine bamboo pieces.  The suling is a bamboo mouth flute used by the men in courting women.  Another bamboo instrument used by the men in expressing love or admiration is the kulaing.  The [[Kulintangan]] or kwintangan consists of several bronze gongs arranged according to size, and used during celebrations such as weddings and graduations. Any individual played it in the home and after work, for self-expression and relaxation. The agong is a percussion instrument used to announce marriage or for tolling the dead. The jabujabu (djabu-djabu) is a type of drum that summons the people to prayer (Nicolas 1977: 100–108; Sherfan 1976:195–199).

There are three main types of Yakan vocal music: the lugu and other melodies used in reading the Quran and other religious books; the kalangan or songs which may be further reclassified into Jamiluddin and Lunsey; and the katakata, nahana, yaya, lembukayu, and sa-il, among others. The kalangan, jamiluddin, katakata, nahana, and yaya are sung solo, while the lunsey, sa-il, meglubulebu seputangen, and lembukayu involves singers from two groups singing solo as they answer each other. 
The kalangan, jamiluddin, lunsey, and lembukayu are courting songs.  The katakata, jamiluddin, and nahana may also narrate the history of the Yakan people.  The katakata is a long traditional song narrating the lives, loves, and historical backgrounds of people who lived during early times.  The Yakan believed that such stories originated from people who lived in another world.  The katakata is sung only at night, at a big gathering with food served by the host or hostess.  The singing, in episodes, may last for several nights.  The singer lies on a mat, the back supported by several pillows.  The audience, either sit or lie around the singer.  The jamiluddin relates love stories.  At present, it is also sung when families discuss marriage engagements.  Both the katakata and jamiluddin are sung by wise men and women of the tribe.

The sa-il and lunsey are sung during a wedding ceremony, with messages revolving around good advice regarding married life.  Another type of sa-il is sung during the magtammat or Quranic graduation. 
During social gatherings, the maglebu-lebu seputangan is sung, by a group of men answering a group of women.  Each group has a soloist who sings the kalangan, expressed in metaphors. 
The yaya is a lullaby.  The magsambag is a method of studying the [[Quran]] in which a [[Murid]] or student follows the Quranic singing of the teacher.  The student and teacher are not allowed to sing together.

Then there are the songs, which the Yakan sing during daily activities.  In keeping watch over rice fields, they sing some forms of the jamiluddin and kalangan.  While resting at home, they also leisurely sing the katakata, jamiluddin, and nahana.  Children at play imitate the adults in singing the kalangan, jamiluddin, lembukayu, and lugu (Nicolas 1977:97–100).
One popular Yakan dance adopted from the [[Tausūg people|Tausug]]s [[Pangalay]] is called mangalay.  The dance is accompanied by the kunlintangan kayu and played by three people.  In the Yakan "bumblebee" mimetic dance usually performed by a male dancer, a searcher successfully finds honey with the aid of a torch.  He overeats, and the result is a stomachache (Orosa-Goquingco 1980:175).  Another example of a mimetic dance is the tahing baila, which imitates the movement of a fish (Tiongson 1991:236).  At weddings, the tumahik or war dance is to be performed by the groom as well as male relatives of both the groom and the bride.  Dressed in Yakan finery, the dancer uses a spear and a shield to fight an imaginary enemy to the music of the kulintangan.

==Tausug==
[[File:Tausug Piyutu Vendor.JPG|thumb|A Tausug child vendor selling ''piyutu'' (a traditional steamed [[tapioca]])]]
The [[Tausūg people|Tausug]] are the Yakan's traditional rivals in the Sulu Archipelago. Based primarily in the island of Jolo, the Tausug built a powerful maritime confederation of Datus and Rajas extending from the Sulu Archipelago to Palawan and North Borneo. They inhabit Basilan's coastal areas, specifically around the island's southwest and northwestern communities. Known to be fierce warriors and sailors throughout the 16th to the 19th centuries, they withstood Spanish incursions for over 350 years, succumbing only in 1876, and then to the Americans in 1915.

"Tausug" derives from ''tau'' meaning "man" and sug meaning "current," and translates into "people of the current." It refers to the majority Islamized group in the Sulu archipelago, their language, and culture. The Tausug, are predominant in the northern part of Sulu province, i.e., Jolo Island and the neighboring islands of Pata, Marunggas, Tapul, and Lugus, and to a lesser extent in Siasi and Pangutaran (Arce 1963:3). The province of Sulu derives its name from ''sulug'' or ''sūg'' which in Tausug means "ocean current," while Sulu's capital Jolo is the Spanish corruption of Sulu.

The Tausug speak [[Tausug language|''Bahasa Sūg'']], a Malayo-Polynesian language related to the Visayan variety spoken in Surigao, and write in a Malayo-Arabic script known as [[Jawi script|Jawi]] or ''sulat sūg''.

Tausug visual arts are represented by carvings, metalworks, woodworks, tapestry and embroidery, mat making and basketry, textile and fashion, pottery, and other minor arts (Szanton 1963). In general, Tausug visual arts follow the Islamic prohibition of representing human or animal forms. Consequently, Mindanao and Sulu have developed ukkil or abstract motifs which are carved, printed, or painted into various media. These motifs are suggestive of leaves, vines, flowers, fruits, and various geometric shapes.

Tausug carving is best exemplified by the sunduk or grave marker. Although not as stylized as those of the Samal, the Tausug sunduk are wood or stone carvings of geometric or floral forms. Women's grave markers are flatter with carved geometric designs, those of the men are more floral. Sakayan or outriggers present yet another media for Tausug carving. Adornments are usually made on the prow and sometimes on the sambili or strips across the hull. The carvings are done either on the boat itself, or on a separate piece of wood which is then attached to the vessel. Abstract manok-manok (bird) motifs are the most common. Ajong-ajong/sula-sula are carved tips supporting the wrapped sail; the hidjuk (dark cord) on the sangpad (prow-plate) also serve as decoration. Carved ''saam'' or cross—pieces supporting the outriggers are called the mata (eyes) of the boat. Colors used on the finished carvings are yellow, red, green, white, and blue (Szanton 1973:33–47).
[[File:Tausug weapons.jpg|thumb|left|Tausug blades and barongs.]]
Tausug ''mananasal'' or blacksmiths produce bolo, kalis, and barong (bladed weapons). Fishing implem-ents are also made, such as the ''sangkil'' (single-pointed spear) and the ''sapang'' (three-pronged spear). The more expensively fashioned blades have floral and geometric incisions; the ganja or metal strips which lock the handle and the blade are a decorative as well a functional device. Bronze casting is not as well developed as it is in Lanao. Among the several functional pieces produced were the ''batunjang'' (standing trays) and the ''talam'' (flat trays). Gold and silver-smithing for jewelry remain lucrative. Items produced by the local goldsmith include the ''singsing'' (ring), ''gallang'' (bracelet), ''gantung liug'' (necklace), ''bang'' (stud earring), ''aritis'' (dangling earring), ''pin'' (brooch), and gold teeth. In the past, ''tambuku'' (buttons) made of gold or silver decorated the traditional male and female costumes and were made with exquisite designs, often inlaid with ''palmata'' (semiprecious stones or gems). Among the favorite palmata are ''mussah'' (pearl), ''intan'' (diamond), ''kumalah'' (ruby) (Szanton 1973:47–51; Amilbangsa 1983:142–157).

An example of Tausug woodwork is the ''puhan'' (wooden handle) of bladed weapons which may be simple or decorated with gold or silver wires, strings, and rings. For the barong, the handle is wrapped in cord and metal at the far end, and carved and polished at the upper part. At the end of the grip is a protrusion carved with ukkil designs. The handle of the kalis, which the Tausug terms as ''daganan kalis'', can also be profusely decorated, sometimes with mother-of-pearl. Taguban (scabbards) are beautifully carved and are covered with budbud (fine rattan). Other woodworks include kitchen utensils and furniture items like beds, chests, and wardrobes (Szanton 1973:51–54).

There are two types of tapestries that the Tausug use to hang as house decoration: the luhul or canopy that hangs from the ceiling, and the kikitil/buras or wall tapestry. The ukkil design used for both is first traced on a starched white cloth which is then cut and sewn over a red, green, yellow, or blue background material. The ukkil design of the luhul, for example, is in the form of a tree with spreading leaves, vines, flowers, and branches. About 1 m wide, the kikitil is a smaller version of the luhul and is hung on the wall. The size of the room determines the length of the kikitil which is divided into various units corresponding to individualized panels. The ukkil design may be similar in all units.
[[File:Pis siyabit (headscarf), Tausug people, Philippines, Honolulu Museum of Art 14451.1.JPG|thumb|right|A ''Pis siyabit'' (headscarf) made of silk and tapestry weave at the [[Honolulu Museum of Art]].]]
Embroidery, another Tausug visual art form, is used to ornament table cloth, pillow cases, bed spreads, and the ''habul tiyahian'' (embroidered tube). The brightest silk thread is often used for the habul to underscore the design, which follows the ukkil pattern.
Used as bedding or underbedding, baluy or mats are usually made from pandanus. Double layering provides decoration and color; a simple base mat is sewn under a colored panel which has been dyed with one or more colors. The designs the Tausug usually adopt are the geometric patterns found on the ''pis siabit'' (male headgear) or the plaid known as ''baluy palang''. Mat designs are memorized and passed on to the next generation.

The Tausug male hat is made by weaving nito with bamboo strips over nipa leaves. Thus it is three-layered and woven in a sawali pattern. Structure and form are provided by the nipa leaves and the light bamboo frame, while texture and feel are supplied by the nito strips. The open-weave layer assures ventilation inside. Another example of Tausug basketry is the small nito container, 18–20&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter, used either as a coin or as a personal basket. If used as a personal basket, it comes with cover and handle. As a coin basket, it is supplied with a loop to allow it to be carried on a finger. A slit serves as the coin slot. Aniline dyes-magenta, blue, violet, and green-color the nito strips (Lane 1986:193-194).

Hablun or textile weaving is another well-known art form among the Tausug. The most popular woven material is the pis siabit or male headgear, which is about 1 sqm in size and distinct for its geometric designs. Because of its intricacy, one pis takes about three to four weeks of work. Only women weave the pis and other materials such as the kambut (sash) and kandit (loincloth and sash), which unfortunately have completely disappeared (Szanton 1973:6.4–65).
The female biyatawi is a blouse made of plain material like satin and is ornamented with tambuku (gold or silver buttons) on the breast, shoulders, and cuffs. It is usually worn with sawwal (loose trousers) of silk or brocade. A habul tiyahian is either slung across the shoulder or allowed to hang on one arm (Amilbangsa 1983:76–113).

The patadjung is an all-purpose skirt worn by both men and women. It has various other uses: as a turung or headcover, sash or waistband, blanket, ham-mock, and others. Resembling a big pillow case, the cloth for a patadjung has designs which are variously inspired: batik prints from Indonesia and Malaysia, checks and stripes from India, dunggala or stylized geometrical and floral patterns from Sarawak, Indone-sia, or Malaysia, calligraphic motifs from the Middle East (Amilbangsa 1983:82).

Tausug men wear the sawwal kuput or sawwal kantiyu (tight and loose trousers respectively), and match this with the badju lapi, a collarless short-tailored jacket similar to the biyatawi. The sleeves of the badju lapi are either long or "three-fourth's" with slits at the wrists. The badju lapi is likewise ornamented with tambuku on the breast, shoulders, and cuffs. The legs of the sawwal kaput are skin-tight down to the ankles, and have 22.5&amp;nbsp;cm slits on each side, which are also decorated with buttons. A kandit (handwoven or embroidered sash) tied around the waist serves to keep the sawwal kuput in place. A pis siabit is either tied around the head or left to hang on the shoulder (Amilbangsa 1983:114–130).

Function and simplicity define Tausug pottery. Decorations are limited to simple geometric lines as the emphasis has always been on the quantity not quality of the product. Examples include pots, vases, jugs, and various pieces of kitchenware (Szanton 1973: 61–63).

Tutup or plate covers are made by Tausug men and women; smaller pieces are called turung dulang riki-riki, and are used as wall adornment. Tutup mea-sure about 75&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter and are made of coconut leaves inside, and silal or buri leaves outside. Colored pandan leaves are sewn on the exterior and serve as decoration (Szanton 1973:64).

Calligraphy is found printed or carved on doors and gates, as well as on tapestries. Musical instruments, especially the gabbang (native xylophone), are also decorated by the Tausug (Szanton 1973:65).

[[File:PhetandingKoBayanan.jpg|thumb|right|Tausug women in a traditional Tausug fan dance, ''Kinding sindaw''.]]

Various musical instruments, played solo or as an ensemble, provide the Tausug with music. Most notable is the kulintangan ensemble consisting of two gandang (drums), a tungallan (large gong), a duwahan (set of two-paired gongs), and the kulintangan (a graduated series of 8 to 11 small gongs). At least five players are needed to play the ensemble which is used to accompany dances or provide music during celebra-tions (Kiefer 1970:2).

Other popular instruments are the gabbang (na-tive xylophone) and the biyula (native violin). With 14 to 24 keys divided into seven-note scales, the gabbang has become the most popular musical instrument in Sulu. It is used to accompany Tausug vocal music such as the sindil. The tune produced when the gabbang is played solo by a man or woman is called tahtah.

The biyula is similar to but larger than the western violin. It consists of four strings played by a bow made of horsehair. Traditionally played by men, the biyula, with the gabbang, accompany the sindil (Kiefer 1970:2)

Flute music is associated with peace and travel. It represented by the following less popular instruments: the saunay (reed flute), suling (bamboo flute), and kulaing (jaw harp). The saunay is essentially a six-holed slender bamboo, 1.5&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter, capped by a sampung simud (mouthguard). A resonating chamber made of palm leaves is housed in the mouthguard. The suling is a larger version of the saunay. It is a 60-cm long bamboo with a 2-cm diameter. Like the saunay, it has six fingerholes (Kiefer 1970:4).

The repertoire for Tausug instrumental music include: the gabbang tahtah (gabbang with biyula accompaniment); the kasi-lasa, lugu, and tahtah (biyula songs); the sinug kiadtu-kari (kulintangan); the tiawag kasi (saunay music), the tahtah (suling music); and others (Kiefer 1970).
Kalangan or Tausug vocal music can be divided into narrative and lyric songs, and further into the lugu and the paggabang traditions. The luguh tradition denotes unaccompanied religious songs, while the paggabang tradition applies to "more mundane" songs that are accompanied by the gabbang and biyula (Trimillos 1972).

Narrative songs tell a story and include all the sung kissa like the parang sabil. Lyric songs express ideas and feelings and consist of the langan batabata (children's songs), the baat (occupational songs), the baat caallaw and pangantin (funeral and bridal songs, respectively), the tarasul (sung poems), the sindil (sung verbal jousts), the liangkit (from langkit or "chained"), and the sangbay or song to accompany the dalling-dalling dance.

The langan batabata are more specifically lullabies. They have a soft and relaxing melody (Tuban 1977:210). Baat and kalangan are the same, the latter being the more general term to refer to singing. The baat taallaw have a melancholic melody. The baat pangantin are also known as langan pangantin. With a soothing melody, they are used to reassure a bride and to console a friend (Rixhon 1974a:51).

The sindil (sung verbal jousts) belong to the gabbang tradition and are performed by both sexes conducting an extemporaneous battle of wits. Teasing, jokes, and innuendos flow into the verses, the better ones applauded by the audience (Kiefer 1970: 10).

The liangkit are long solo pieces accompanied by the gabbang and biyula. Unlike the sindil, they are not performed extemporaneously. The subject of the liangkit is wide-love, war, nature, and others. The Tausug lelling, adopted from the Samal, are part of the liangkit tradition, but are sung to the music provided by a guitar. They relate and comment on current events. One good ex-ample is the lelling narrating the entry of the Moro National Liberation Front forces into Jolo town in February 1974.

The art of singing to the dalling-dalling dance is called pagsangbay. The song usually dictates the movement that the dancers should follow.

The lugu or sail tradition is associated with religious rituals and rites of the life cycle such as wed-dings, births, paggunting, pagtammat, and funerals. It is characterized by dahig or jugjug (high vocal tension). The tempo is slow with long sustained and stressed tones. Although usually performed by women, the lugu can also be sung by men (Trimillos 1974).

[[File:Pangalay1.jpg|thumb|right|A group of folk dancers performing the traditional [[Pangalay]] dance.]]

The most well-known dance of the Tausug is the pangalay. It is the basic style from which the movements of various dances in Sulu and Tawi-Tawi are derived. The pangalay is danced by either sex, alone or together, and is usually accompanied by the kulintang ensemble. The movement of the pangalay is concentrated on the thighs, knees, ankles, toes, waist, shoulders, neck, elbows, wrists, and fingers. The torso is usually kept rigid, moving upward or downward as the flow of the dance demands. The feet is firmly planted on the ground and move in small shuffling steps (Amilbangsa 1983:14, 62).
The pangalay dances are distinctive in their use of the janggay (metal nail extenders) to underscore hand movements. The extended fingers are stiff and set apart from the thumbs.

Another well-known Tausug dance is the dalling—dalling, where handkerchiefs or fans are used. A sing-er usually accompanies the dance by describing the various movements of the dancer. The song is known as the sangbay and the singing. pagsangbay. Some of the songs used are "Lingisan/kinjung-kinjung," "Dalling-dalling". The development of the dalling—dalling is attributed to a native Tausug by the name of Albani who became a famous proponent of the dance (Amilbangsa 1983:42).

Tausug martial-art dances are performed by men and include the langka-silat and the langka-kuntaw. The langka-silat simulates a fight and is usually per-formed with two or three other dancers. The langka—kuntaw is a dance of self-defense, resembling the martial arts of China, Japan, and Burma (Amilbangsa 1983:32–35).

A Tausug occupational dance is the linggisan which depicts a bird in flight; the taute, which shows a fisher diving for the prickly catfish; and the suwa—suwa, which shows dancers imitating the swaying of lemon trees (Amilbangsa 1983:28).

==Zamboangueño==

[[File:Paragua.jpg|thumb|right|Jota Zamboangueña, traditional Zamboangueño dance]]

[[Zamboangueño people|Zamboangueño Chavacano]], also variously known as Zamboangueño, has been known for quite to be both a Castilian-based creole language and an ethnolinguistic nation or ethnolinguistic group born officially on June 23, 1635. It is also one of the six (6) dialects of [[Chavacano]]. Some of which like the Viasayan Chavacano, have already died off just a few years after the surrender of the Spanish. Chabacano in Luzon stayed on a little longer. These are found in the Ermita district of Manila known as Ermitense dialect (Spanish Criollo), Cavite City known as Caviteñ dialect (Spanish and Tagalog) and Ternate known as Bahra dialect (Spanish-Portuguese, Tagalog and Malay). These Chavacano speakers, were decimated during the Japanese occupation, easy targets because of their lighter skin and obviously Western tongue.

The Chavacanos de Zamboanga o Zamboangueño, however, are rooted in the Spanish-Jesuit settlement that grew around Fuerte de San Jose established in 1635. The Zamboangueño Chavacano of today is the result of centuries of cultural interaction and intermarriage between and among three (3) main racial/ethnic groups: (1) Visayan, specifically the original 1,000 Cebuanos brought in from Cebu to build the Spanish fortress (as well as the many Cebuanos and Ilongos who followed soon after), (2) the Christianized natives, mostly Subanen, Tau Laut (Samal) and Yakan converted and tended to by the enterprising Jesuits; and (3) Castilians (Spaniards, Mexicans and Peruvians). Later infusions by other languages such as Ilocanos Tagalogs, Sama, Badjau, Suluanon Tausug, et al. in the country and around the world further enriched the Zamboangueño Chavacano language.

Of all these, the Spanish culture had the strongest impact – about 80% of Zamboangueño culture is anchored on España and its three centuries of presence. The greatest number of Zamboangueño profess the Catholic faith, hewing closely to their avowedly Hispanic heritage.[http://www.zamboanga.gov.ph/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=206&amp;Itemid=28]

The Zamboangueños inhabit the northern coasts of the island, mostly residing in the urban centers of Isabela and Lamitan cities, they are joined by other Christian ethnolinguistic groups in these areas, usually the Bisaya Sugbuanon (Cebuano), Bisaya-Ilonggo, Ilocano and Tagalog. They own most of the agricultural lands on the island, and is the group with the highest literacy, highest per capita incomes, and lowest poverty incidence on the island.

Zamboangueño customs are based on Spanish and European notions of patriarchal authority, etiquette, familial obligation, as well as a feeling of superiority - characterized by excessive pride, vanity, jealousy, boastfulness, and snobbishness - over their less-Westernized neighbors. They are mostly devout Roman Catholics.

Zamboangueño courtship traditions are elaborate and regulated by a long list of required social graces. For example, a perfectly respectable Zamboangueño gentleman would not sit unless permitted to do so by the woman’s parents, he then had to endure questions pertaining to his lineage, credentials, and occupation. Finally, the courtship curfew, and the need to cultivate the goodwill of all the members of the woman’s family were paramount considerations before any headway could be made in pursuing a Zamboangueña senorita's hand in marriage.

Zamboangueño songs and dances are derived primarily from Spanish/Iberian performances. Specifically, the Jota Zamboangueña, a Zamboangueño version of the quick-stepping [[flamenco]] with bamboo clappers in lieu of Spanish castanets, are regularly presented during fiestas and formal "tertulias" or other Zamboangueño festivities.

Likewise, Zamboangueño traditional costumes are closely associated with Spanish formal dress. Men wear close-necked jackets, "de baston" pants, and European style shoes, complete with the de rigueur "bigotillos" (mustache). More recently, Chavacano men have adapted to wearing the formal Barong Tagalog, worn by men throughout the Philippines. Zamboangueño women claim ownership of the "mascota", a formal gown with a fitting bodice, her shoulders draped demurely by a luxuriously embroidered, though stiff, panuelo and fastened at the breast by a brooch or a medal. The skirt tapers down from the waist but continues on to an extended trail called the "cola". The "cola may be held on one hand as the lady walks around, or it may likewise by pinned on the waist or slipped up a cord (belt) that holds the dainty "abanico" or purse.

Of late, the Zamboangueños de Basilan have acquired more modern tastes in food, clothing and customs, usually based on the generally preferred American/Western model. The traditional Zamboangueño dress has been limited to formal functions, replaced by the more common shirt, denim jeans and sneakers for men, and shirts, blouses, skirts or pants, and heeled shoes for women. Likewise, [[Taglish]], a mix of Tagalog and English is increasingly accepted as a modern and convenient variant of either the more difficult (for Zamboangueño) Tagalog or the more formal English. An even more confusing mix of Tag-lish and Zamboangueño Chavacano is likewise spoken especially by the younger generations of Zamboangueño.

'''Deportation''' is the expulsion of a person or group of people from a place or [[country]]. The term ''expulsion'' is often used as a [[synonym]] for deportation, though expulsion is more often used in the context of [[international law]], while deportation is more used in [[municipal law|national (municipal) law]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean-Marie Henckaerts]] in his book 'Mass Expulsion in Modern International Law and Practice'' wrote: "As far as deportation is concerned, there is no general feature that clearly sets it apart from expulsion. Both term basically indicate the same phenomenon. [...] The only difference seems to be one of preferential use, expulsion being more an international term while deportation is more used in municipal law. [...] One study [discusses this distinction] but immediately adds that in modern practice both terms have become interchangeable." See {{cite book|author=Jean-Marie Henckaerts|title=Mass Expulsion in Modern International Law and Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s3kaTLyAKo0C&amp;pg=PA5|date=6 July 1995|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Pblishers|isbn=90-411-0072-5|pages=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

Definitions of deportation apply equally to nationals and foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;Henckaerts, ''Mass Expulsion in Modern International Law and Practice'', 1995, pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, in the common usage the expulsion of foreign nationals is usually called deportation, whereas the expulsion of nationals is called [[extradition]], banishment, [[exile]], or [[penal transportation]]. For example, in the [[United States]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Strictly speaking, transportation, extradition, and deportation, although each has the effect of removing a person from the country, are different things, and have different purposes. Transportation is by way of punishment of one convicted of an offense against the laws of the country. Extradition is the surrender to another country of one accused of an offense against its laws, there to be tried, and, if found guilty, punished. Deportation is the removal of an alien out of the country, simply because his presence is deemed inconsistent with the public welfare and without any punishment being imposed or contemplated either under the laws of the country out of which he is sent or of those of the country to which he is taken."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Fong Yue Ting v. United States]]'', 149 U.S. 697, at 709 (1893).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Expulsion is an act by a public authority to remove a person or persons against his or her will from the territory of that state. A successful expulsion of a person by a country is called a deportation.{{sfn|IOM|2011|p=27}}

According to the European Court of Human Rights, collective expulsion is any measure compelling non-nationals, as a group, to leave a country, except where such a measure is taken on the basis of a reasonable and objective examination of the particular case of each individual non-national of the group. Mass expulsion may also occur when members of an ethnic group are sent out of a state regardless of nationality. Collective expulsion, or expulsion en masse, is prohibited by several instruments of international law.{{sfn|IOM|2011|p=35}}

==History==

Deportations widely occurred in ancient history.

===In Achaemenid Empire===
Deportation was practiced as a policy toward rebellious people in [[Achaemenid Empire]]. The precise legal status of the deportees is unclear; but ill-treatment is not recorded. Instances include:&lt;ref name=iranica&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/deportations|title=DEPORTATIONS – Encyclopaedia Iranica|first=|last=electricpulp.com|website=www.iranicaonline.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Parthian Empire===

Unlike in the Achaemenid and Sassanian periods, records of deportation are rare during the [[Parthian Empire|Arsacid Parthian]] period. One notable example was the deportaion of the [[Mards]] in [[Charax Spasinu|Charax]], near [[Rey, Iran|Rhages]] (Ray) by [[Phraates I]]. The 10,000 Roman prisonors of war after the [[Battle of Carrhae]] appear to have been deported to [[Alexandria Margiana]] (Merv) near the eastern border in 53 BC, who are said to married to local people. It is hypothesized that some of them founded the Chinese city of [[Li-Jien]] after becoming soldiers for the [[Hsiung-nu]], but this is doubted.&lt;ref name=iranica /&gt;

[[Hyrcanus II]], the Jewish king of Judea, was settled among the Jews of [[Babylon]] in [[Parthian Empire|Parthia]] after being taken as captive by the [[Pompeian–Parthian invasion of 40 BC|Parthian-Jewish forces in 40 BC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kooten |first1=George H. van |last2=Barthel |first2=Peter |title=The Star of Bethlehem and the Magi: Interdisciplinary Perspectives from Experts on the Ancient Near East, the Greco-Roman World, and Modern Astronomy |date=2015 |publisher=BRILL |location=540 |isbn=9789004308473 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pnbsCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA540 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman POWs in the [[Antony's Parthian War]] may have suffered deportation.&lt;ref name=iranica /&gt;

===In Sassanid Empire===

Deportation was widely used by the Sasanians, especially during the [[Roman-Persian wars|wars with the Romans]].

During [[Shapur I]]'s reign, the Romans (including [[Publius Licinius Valerianus|Valerian]]) who were defeated at the [[Battle of Edessa]] were deported to [[Pars (Sasanian province)|Persis]]. Other destinations were [[Parthia]], [[History of Khuzestan Province|Khuzestan]], and [[Asorestan]]. There were cities which were founded and were populated by Romans prisoners of war, including Shadh-Shapur ([[Dayr Mikhraq]]) in [[Meshan]], [[Bishapur]] in Persis, Wuzurg-Shapur ([['Uqbara]]; Marw-Ḥābūr), and [[Gundeshapur]]. Agricultural land were also given to the deportees. These deportations initiated the spread [[Christianity in Iran|Christianity in the Sassanian empire]]. In Rēw-Ardashīr ([[Rishahr]]; Yarānshahr), Persis, there was a church for the Romans and another one for [[Carmanians]].&lt;ref name=iranica /&gt; In the mid-3rd century, Greek-speaking deportees from north-western Syria were settled in [[Kashkar]], Mesopotamia.

After the Arab incursion into Persia during [[Shapur II]]'s reign, he scattered the [[Shapur II's Arab campaign|defeated Arab tribes]] by deporting them to other regions. Some where deported to [[Bahrain]] and [[Carmania (satrapy)|Kirman]], possibly to both populate these unattractive regions (due to their climate) and bringing the tribes under control.&lt;ref name=iranica /&gt;

In 395 AD, 18,000 Roman populations of [[Sophene]], [[Armenia]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[Roman Syria|Syria]], and [[Cappadocia]] were captured and deported by the "[[Huns]]". the prisoners were freed by the Persians as they reached Persia, and were settled in Slōk ([[Veh-Ardashir|Wēh Ardashīr]]) and Kōkbā (Kōkhē). The author of the text ''Liber Calipharum'' has praised the king [[Yazdegerd I]] (399–420) for his treatment of the deportees, who also allowed some to return.&lt;ref name=iranica /&gt;

Major deportations occurred during the [[Anastasian War]].&lt;ref name=iranica /&gt;

Major deportations occurred during the campaigns of [[Khosrau I]] from the Roman cities of [[Sura]], [[Aleppo|Beroea]], [[Antioch]], [[Apamea (Euphrates)|Apamea]], [[Raqqa|Callinicum]], and [[Batnai]] in [[Osrhoene]], to [[Wēh-Antiyōk-Khosrow]] (also known as Rūmagān; in Arabic: al-Rūmiyya). The city was founded near [[Ctesiphon]] especially for them, and Khosrow reportedly "did everything in his power to make the residents want to stay".&lt;ref name=iranica /&gt; The number of the deportees is recorded to be 292,000 in another source.&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, ''The Decline of Iranshahr: Irrigation and Environments in the History of the Middle East, 500 B.C. to A.D. 1500'', 1993. {{page needed|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military occupation==
[[Wikisource:Fourth Geneva Convention#Article 49|Article 49]] of the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]] prohibits the deportation of people into or out of occupied territory under [[belligerent military occupation]]:&lt;ref&gt;Convention (IV) relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War. Geneva, 12 August 1949.[http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/380-600056?OpenDocument Commentary on Part III : Status and treatment of protected persons #Section III : Occupied territories Art. 49] by the [[International Committee of the Red Cross|ICRC]]&lt;/ref&gt;

All countries reserve the right to deport persons without [[right of abode]] even those who are longtime [[Residency (domicile)|residents]] or possess [[permanent residency]]. In general, foreigners who have committed serious crimes, entered the country illegally, overstayed or broken the conditions of their [[Visa (document)|visa]], or otherwise lost their legal status to remain in the country may be administratively removed or deported.&lt;ref&gt;Henckaerts, ''Mass Expulsion in Modern International Law and Practice'', 1995, p. 5; Forsythe and Lawson, ''Encyclopedia of Human Rights'', 1996, pp. 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, even citizens can be deported; Saudi Arabia and the UAE for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21710679-many-are-left-stateless-result-silence-dissidents-gulf-states-are|title=To silence dissidents, Gulf states are revoking their citizenship|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some western countries also have the ability to deport citizens, if they have another nationality or if they acquire citizenship through fraud.

In many cases, deportation is done by the [[government]]'s [[executive (government)|executive]] apparatus, and as such is often subject to a simpler legal process (or none), with reduced or no right to trial, legal representation or [[appeal]] due to the subject's lack of citizenship. For example, in the 1930s, during the Great Depression, more stringent enforcement of immigration laws were ordered by the executive branch of the U.S. government, which led to [[Mexican Repatriation|the expulsion]] of up to 2 million Mexican nationals from the United States.&lt;ref&gt;McKay, "The Federal Deportation Campaign in Texas: Mexican Deportation from the Lower Rio Grande Valley During the Great Depression", ''Borderlands Journal'', Fall 1981; Balderrama and Rodriguez, ''Decade of Betrayal: Mexican Repatriation in the 1930s'', 1995; Valenciana, "Unconstitutional Deportation of Mexican Americans During the 1930s: A Family History and Oral History", ''Multicultural Education'', Spring 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954, the executive branch of the U.S. government implemented [[Operation Wetback]], a program created in response to public hysteria about immigration and immigrants from Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;See Albert G.

The ICE website publishes removal statistics annually on its website. According to recent numbers ICE removed a total of 240,255 aliens in FY 2016, a two percent increase over FY 2015, but a 24 percent decrease from FY 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ice.gov/removal-statistics/2016|title=FY 2016 ICE Immigration Removals|website=www.ice.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Already in [[natural law]] of the 18th century, philosophers agreed that expulsion of a nation from the territory that it historically inhabits is not allowable.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [[Emerich de Vattel]], ''The Law of Nations - Principles of the Law of Nature, Applied to the Conduct and Affairs of Nations and Sovereigns'' (translated from French), Philadelphia 1856 (Dublin 1792), Book II, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pBwMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA168 § 90.]&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 20th century, the [[United Nations]] drafted a code related to [[crimes against humanity]]; Article 18 of the ''Draft Code of Crimes Against the Peace and Security of Mankind'' declares "large scale" arbitrary or forcible deportation to be a [[crime against humanity]].&lt;ref&gt;International Law Commission, ''Yearbook of the International Law Commission 1996: Report of the Commission to the General Assembly on the Work of Its 48th Session'', 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Deportation often requires a specific process that must be validated by a court or senior government official. It should not be confused with [[administrative removal]], which is the process of a country denying entry to individuals at a port of entry and expelling them.&lt;ref&gt;Fragomen and Bell, ''Immigration Fundamentals: A Guide to Law and Practice''. New York: Practising Law Institute, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/deportations-removals-and-voluntary-departures-from-the-uk/|title=Deportations, Removals and Voluntary Departures from the UK - Migration Observatory|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internal deportation==
[[Image:Bisbee deportation lowell.jpg|thumb|Striking miners and others being deported at gunpoint from [[Lowell, Arizona]], on July 12, 1917, during the [[Bisbee Deportation]].]]

Deportation can also happen within a state, when (for example) an individual or a group of people is forcibly resettled to a different part of the country. If ethnic groups are affected by this, it may also be referred to as [[population transfer]]. The rationale is often that these groups might assist the enemy in war or insurrection. For example, the American state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] deported 400 female mill workers during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] on the suspicion they were Northern sympathizers.&lt;ref&gt;Dillman, ''The Roswell Mills and A Civil War Tragedy: Excerpts from Days Gone by in Alpharetta and Roswell, Georgia'', 1996; Hitt, ''Charged with Treason: The Ordeal of 400 Mill Workers During Military Operations in Roswell, Georgia, 1864–1865'', 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], [[Joseph Stalin]] (see [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union]]) ordered the deportation of [[Volga German]]s, [[Chechens]], [[Crimean Tatars]], [[Ukrainians]] and others to areas away from the front, including central and western Soviet Union. Some historians have estimated the number of deaths from the deportation to be as high as 1 in 3 among some populations.&lt;ref&gt;In one estimate, based on a report by [[Lavrenti Beria]] to [[Joseph Stalin]], 150,000 of 478,479 deported Ingush and Chechen people (or 31.3 percent) died within the first four years of the resettlement. See: Kleveman, Lutz. ''The New Great Game: Blood and Oil in Central Asia''. Jackson, Tenn.: Atlantic Monthly Press, 2003. {{ISBN|0-87113-906-5}}. Another scholar puts the number of deaths at 22.7 percent: Extrapolating from [[NKVD]] records, 113,000 Ingush and Chechens died (3,000 before deportation, 10,000 during deportation, and 100,000 after resettlement) in the first three years of the resettlement out of 496,460 total deportees. See: Naimark, Norman M. ''Fires of Hatred: Ethnic Cleansing in Twentieth-Century Europe''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-674-00994-0}}. A third source says a quarter of the 650,000 deported Chechens, Ingush, Karachais and Kalmyks died within four years of resettlement. See: Mawdsley, Evan. ''The Stalin Years: The Soviet Union 1929–1953''. Manchester, England: Manchester University Press, 2003. {{ISBN|0-7190-6377-9}}. However, estimates of the number of deportees sometimes varies widely. Two scholars estimated the number of Chechen and Ingush deportees at 700,000, which would halve the percentage estimates of deaths. See: Fischer, Ruth and Leggett, John C. ''Stalin and German Communism: A Study in the Origins of the State Party''. Edison, N.J.: Transaction Publishers, 2006. {{ISBN|0-87855-822-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Conquest, Robert. ''The Nation Killers''. New York: Macmillan, 1970. {{ISBN|0-333-10575-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 26, 2004 the [[European Parliament]] characterized deportations of the Chechens as an act of [[genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.massviolence.org/The-Massive-Deportation-of-the-Chechen-People-How-and-why?artpage=8#outil_sommaire_5 Campana, Aurélie.

The Soviet Union also used deportation, as well as instituting the Russian language as the only working language and other such tactics, to achieve [[Russification]] of its occupied territories (such as the [[Baltic nations]] and [[Bessarabia]]). In this way, it removed the historical ethnic populations and repopulated the areas with Russian nationals. The deported people were sent to remote, scarcely populated areas or to GULAG labour camps. It has been estimated that, in their entirety, internal forced migrations affected some 6 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=[[Pavel Polian]]| title=[[Against Their Will (book)|Against Their Will]]: The History and Geography of Forced Migrations in the USSR| publisher=[[Central European University Press]], 2004 |isbn=978-963-9241-68-8| page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8ktrYux1gTMC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=internal+forced+migrations+6+million+people#v=onepage&amp;q=internal%20forced%20migrations%206%20million%20people&amp;f=false 4]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosefielde83"&gt;{{cite book |title= [[Red Holocaust (2009 book)|Red Holocaust]] |last= Rosefielde |first= Steven |authorlink= Steven Rosefielde |coauthors= |year= 2009 |publisher= [[Routledge]] |location= |isbn= 978-0-415-77757-5 |pages=83 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, some 1 to 1.5 million perished.&lt;ref&gt;[[Norman Naimark|Naimark, Norman M.]] ''Stalin's Genocides (Human Rights and Crimes against Humanity)''.

In the late 19th and early 20th century, deportation of union members and [[trade union|labor]] leaders was not uncommon in the United States during [[strike action|strikes]] or labor disputes.&lt;ref&gt;Deportation is the term commonly used to depict ejecting an individual from a political or legal jurisdiction. It has been used by the press, legal community, historians and sociologists. See, variously, "Lewis Attacks Deportation of Leaders by West Virginia Authorities", ''The New York Times'', July 17, 1921; "The Law of Necessity As Applied in the Bisbee Deportation Case", ''Arizona Law Review'', 1961; Martin, ''The Corpse On Boomerang Road: Telluride's War on Labor, 1899–1908'', 2004; Silverberg, "Citizens' Committees: Their Role in Industrial Conflict", ''Public Opinion Quarterly'', March 1941; Suggs, ''Colorado's War on Militant Unionism: James H. Peabody and the Western Federation of Miners'', 1991; Lindquist and Fraser, "A Sociological Interpretation of the Bisbee Deportation", ''Pacific Historical Review'', November 1968. Deportation has also been used to describe these events by Presidential commissions; see President's Mediation Commission, ''Report on the Bisbee Deportations'', 1918. The U.S. Supreme Court has also referred to forced internal removal as deportation; see ''[[United States v. Guest]]'', 383 U.S. 745, (1966), Harlan, concurring in part and dissenting in part, at 766.&lt;/ref&gt; For an example, see the [[Bisbee Deportation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Bisbee Deportation 1917 |publisher=University of Arizona |url=http://www.library.arizona.edu/exhibits/bisbee/ |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colonial deportations==
{{see also|Convicts in Australia}}
Deporting individuals to a colony is a special case that is neither completely internal nor external. Such deportation has occurred in history. For example, after 1717, [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland|Britain]] deported around 40,000&lt;ref name="DH"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hill |first=David |title=1788 the brutal truth of the first fleet |publisher=Random House Australia |isbn=978-1741668001 |date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}} religious objectors and criminals to America before the practice ceased in 1776.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels, ''Coming to America: A History of Immigration and Ethnicity in American Life'', 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The criminals were sold by jailers to shipping contractors, who then sold them to plantation owners. The criminal was forced to work for the plantation owner for the duration of their sentence.&lt;ref name=DH/&gt;{{rp|5}} The loss of America as a colony, Australia became the destination for criminals deported to British colonies. More than 160,000&lt;ref name=DH/&gt;{{rp|1}} criminals were transported to Australia between 1787 and 1855.&lt;ref&gt;McCaffray and Melancon, p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

The historical term "deportation", occurring frequently instead of the religious term [[Holocaust]] in various locations, thus means in effect "sent to their deaths" — as distinct from deportations in other times and places.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Holocaust Glossary |publisher=Scholastic |url=http://teacher.scholastic.com/frank/gloss.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An estimated 120,000 [[Serbs]] were deported from the [[Independent State of Croatia]] to [[German-occupied Serbia]], and 300,000 fled by 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ramet|first=Sabrina P.|title=The Three Yugoslavias: State-Building and Legitimation, 1918–2005|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FTw3lEqi2-oC|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2006|location=New York|isbn=0-253-34656-8|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Noteworthy deportees==
[[Alexander Berkman]], [[Emma Goldman]], [[C.L.R. James]], [[Claudia Jones]], [[Fritz Julius Kuhn]], [[Lucky Luciano]], and [[Anna Sage]] were all deported from the United States by being arrested and brought to the federal immigration control station on [[Ellis Island]] in New York Harbor and, from there, forcibly removed from the United States.

==Popular culture==
In literature, deportation appears as an overriding theme in the 1935 novel, ''Strange Passage'' by Theodore D. Irwin.
Films depicting or dealing with fictional cases of deportation are many and varied. Among them are ''[[Ellis Island (1936 film)|Ellis Island]]'' (1936), ''[[Exile Express]]'' (1939), ''[[Five Came Back]]'' (1939), ''[[Deported (film)|Deported]]'' (1950), and ''[[Gambling House (film)|Gambling House]]'' (1951). More recently, [[wikipedia:Shottas|''Shottas'']] (2002) treated the issue of U.S. deportation to the Caribbean post-1997.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14731">The '''Digital Visitor and Resident''' ('''V&amp;R''') model provides a [[Conceptual framework|framework]] to depict how user preference and habit motivates engagement with technology and the web. V&amp;R is commonly described as a [[Continuum (measurement)|continuum]], with two modes of online engagement at either end, making a separation between different approaches to engagement. People operating in Visitor mode have a defined goal or task, and select an appropriate online tool to meet their needs as they arise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ala.org/acrl/sites/ala.org.acrl/files/content/publications/booksanddigitalresources/digital/ii-booth.pdf|title = Informing Innovation: Tracking Student Interest in Emerging Library Technologies at Ohio University|date = 2009|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Booth|first = Char|isbn = 978-0-8389-8526-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, using a [[smartphone]] to search the internet for directions to a local bookstore, thus finding a particular piece of information online and then going offline to complete the task. There will be little in terms of social visibility or trace when online in Visitor mode. People operating in Resident mode are online to connect to, or to be with, other people. For example, posting to the wall in Facebook, tweeting, blogging, or posting comments on blogs. The web supports the projection of their identity and facilitates relationships. In other words, Residents live a percentage of their lives online. Unlike the Visitor mode, there will be online visibility and presence when in Resident mode.&lt;ref name="jiscinfonet.ac.uk"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Evaluating digital services: a Visitors and Residents approach|url = http://www.jiscinfonet.ac.uk/infokits/evaluating-services/|website = www.jiscinfonet.ac.uk|accessdate = 2015-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is very common for individuals to engage online in a mixture of Visitor and Resident modes depending on what they are trying to achieve.

== Background ==
[[Marc Prensky]]'s notions of [[digital native]]s and digital immigrants &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Digital Natives, Digital Immigrants Part 2: Do They Really Think Differently?null|url = http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/10748120110424843|journal = On the Horizon|date = 2001-11-01|issn = 1074-8121|pages = 1–6|volume = 9|issue = 6|doi = 10.1108/10748120110424843}}&lt;/ref&gt; has had a lasting influence on how educational institutions perceive students and technology. However, Prensky's model has been challenged by other researchers who have debated its parameters. One of these new models is the V&amp;R project.&lt;ref name="jiscinfonet.ac.uk"/&gt; It contrasts with Presky's digital native in that it rejects hard divisions based on the age of the user, and instead focuses on the user's desired level of engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The digital generation|url = http://eltj.oxfordjournals.org/content/65/3/322|journal = ELT Journal|date = 2011-07-01|issn = 0951-0893|pages = 322–325|volume = 65|issue = 3|doi = 10.1093/elt/ccr041|first = Nicky|last = Hockly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mapping process ==
[[File:A Visitors &amp; Residents map of online engagement.jpg|thumb|A detailed Digital Visitors and Residents map of online engagement from a Health and Social Care student in the UK]]The Visitor-Resident continuum illustrates the range of possible modes of engagement individuals now have available to them through the web. The corresponding Digital Visitors and Residents mapping is a tool used by educators and librarians for exploring how their institutional users are engaging with the services they provide. By having students or users map their activity, they can create a picture of their overall engagement. Mapping also can be used to gain a picture of the overall digital presence of a group or department when bringing together and overlaying multiple maps.&lt;ref name="jiscinfonet.ac.uk"/&gt;

== V&amp;R study ==
The V&amp;R project explored learners' motivations behind different types of engagement with the digital environment, when seeking information.  The investigation focused on the sources learners turn to in order to gather information, and which on- and off-line spaces they choose to interact in as part of the learning process. The study used the Digital Visitors and Residents framework to map learners' modes of engagement in both personal and institutional contexts.  The project assessed whether individual approaches shift according to the learners' educational stage or whether they develop practices/literacies in early stages that remain largely unchanged as they progress through their educational career. Learners from both the United Kingdom and the United States participated in the project.&lt;ref name="jiscinfonet.ac.uk"/&gt;

The V&amp;R project used both [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] and [[Qualitative research|qualitative]] methods for a mixed methods approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = &amp;quot;I always stick with the first thing that comes up on Google. . .&amp;quot; Where People Go for Information, What They Use, and Why|url = http://er.educause.edu/articles/2013/12/i-always-stick-with-the-first-thing-that-comes-up-on-google---where-people-go-for-information-what-they-use-and-why|accessdate = 2015-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The qualitative method of semi-structured interviews, sometimes accompanied by monthly diaries and follow-up interviews, was used to create a rich, descriptive longitudinal study of preselected individuals who represent the four educational stages (Emerging, Establishing, Embedding, and Experiencing).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ala.org/acrl/sites/ala.org.acrl/files/content/conferences/confsandpreconfs/2013/papers/Connaway_Google.pdf|title = "I Find Google a lot Easier than Going to the Library Website." Imagine Ways to Innovate and Inspire Students to Use the Academic Library|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |author1=Lynn Silipigni Connaway |author2=Donna Lanclos |author3=Erin M. Hood }}&lt;/ref&gt; Findings, to date, indicate that behavior patterns vary by the participants' educational stage rather than by their age, which varies within each stage. This categorization, by educational stages rather than age, contrasts with Prensky's "natives and immigrants" [[paradigm]]. However, the V&amp;R notion reflects that individual choices about technology and information seeking derive from context— that is, from individuals' educational and professional priorities — rather than from their age.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The findings also indicate that people still rely on other people to get information, especially those within their personal networks.&lt;ref name="oclc.org"&gt;{{Cite web|title = New infokit details information about findings and outputs from Visitors and Residents project|url = http://www.oclc.org/research/news/2014/03-24.html|website = www.oclc.org|accessdate = 2015-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals make decisions based on convenience within the context of their information needs and the situation within which the need arises. Web-based functionalities are the expected norm for services by many people, as the sources that people chose are overwhelmingly digital.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Interviewees mentioned search engines and social media sites far more often than physical places, when looking for information.  This reliance on digital spaces coexists with a persistent need to be in contact with other people both online and face to face. Individuals expect to use their own technology to connect with institutional (and other) resources, and to engage in Resident modes of behavior.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  There is also an underlying perception, particularly by US students, that sources such as [[Wikipedia]] should be avoided, creating a “learning black market” where these sources are covertly used and not mentioned.&lt;ref name="oclc.org"/&gt; Mentions of the free web, as represented by major media sites and Wikipedia, also far outnumbered mentions of university databases or [[Virtual learning environment|course management systems]] such as [[Moodle]], even among graduate students. Participants in all of the educational stages frequently mentioned convenience/ease of use as an important factor in obtaining information.

Undoubtedly, people seek what they need within their existing relationships, and as they move through the educational stages, their networks are increasingly populated with people who have relevant subject expertise. By the time individuals become faculty members, calling a "friend" about an article indefinitely means the friend is also an expert in the field. Relationships are a major factor in how individuals get information and whom they choose for collaboration. The desire to make contact with others also motivates people to engage with technology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Recommendations ==
Services and systems need to be embedded into individual's workflow. Therefore, the institution should provide a broad range of tools for gathering information and create simple and convenient interface designs. Institutions should also eliminate any barriers between information discovery and access, along with the promotion and marketing of services academic communities. Institutions should use individual Internet practices as a guide to linking institutional resources to those on the open web by conversing with their academic constituencies and using what they already know about people using Wikipedia. It is also important to ensure that the library, or institution, has a diverse presence in digital and physical spaces, and engages in innovative strategies for making library collections come to life, using social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = On Facebook, Librarian Brings 2 Students From the Early 1900s to Life|url = http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/on-facebook-librarian-brings-two-students-from-the-early-1900s-to-life/34845|website = The Chronicle of Higher Education Blogs: Wired Campus|date = 2012-01-06|accessdate = 2015-09-26|first = Nick|last = Desantis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== InfoKit ==
The [https://www.jisc.ac.uk/guides/evaluating-digital-services infoKit] draws on the findings and methods of the Jisc/OCLC funded Digital Visitors and Residents (V&amp;R) project which is underpinned by an alternative to Prensky's typing of technology users. It contains advice on evaluating the services you offer to your users. The focus is primarily on digital/online services but set within the broader context of more traditional services, exploring the relationship between the two.&lt;ref name="jiscinfonet.ac.uk"/&gt;

'''Digital phobic''' is an informal phrase used to describe a reluctance to become fully immersed in the [[digital age]] for being fearful of how it might negatively change or alter everyday life.
 
The fast-paced development of the [[digital world]] in the twenty-first century has contributed to the [[digital divide]] becoming a very real problem for a segment of the population for whom a lack of education of, interest in, or access to [[digital device]]s has left them excluded from the technological world and fearful of its growing omnipresence.

Digital phobic is part of a growing dictionary of digital vocabulary exploring the [[social influence|social impact]] of the [[technological age]].  The phrase considers the fears associated with [[technological evolution]] and change, and acknowledges the possibility of exclusion as a result of a rising reliance on technology in day-to-day life.

==Discourse==
Everyday use of technology has increased dramatically since the turn of the century, significantly impacting both those embracing [[technological change]] as well as those reluctant to be a part of it.

A sharp rise in technological innovations during the 21st century has been responsible for changing much of the way we work, socialize, and learn – all of which can be at the foundation of distrust in the technological age.  Psychologists, academics and researchers have begun to consider the base of these fears and consider the social, cultural and environmental circumstances which might catalyze someone to becoming 'digital phobic'.

[[Technophobia]] is used to discuss a fear of advanced technology in a formal capacity and can stem from a number, and combination of, concerns.  With the oncoming of the [[digital age]], worries have broadened from the very earliest fears that technology would eradicate artisanship to concerns over [[data protection]], [[Economic security|financial security]], [[identity theft]], [[technical inability]] and [[invasion of privacy]].

There is no exhaustible list of reasons cited for fearing the digital world and, whilst research into both the cause and consequence of developing a digital phobia remains in its infancy, the presence of digital phobia regardless contributes towards an increasingly comprehensive picture of a series of profiles among digital users.
 
Recent research from Foresters, an international financial services organization, found 2% of the UK population to fall into this category of [[internet user]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/digital-addict--or-just-checking-your-facebook-page-a-quarter-of-all-men-and-women-spend-an-unhealthy-amount-of-time-online-9506966.html Paul Gallagher.  Digital Addict – or just checking your Facebook page?  A quarter of all men and women spend an 'unhealthy amount of time online'.  The Independent.  8 June 2014.  Accessed: 27 August 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt;   A further breakdown of this statistic, sees the percentage of users in development of a digital phobia increase, with 4% fearful of [[online shopping]] for worrying that someone will steal their card details, and 12% fearful that using social media will make it easier for people to find their personal details.

When asked to reason their attitude towards technology as part of this survey, a larger percentage of the UK population were revealed to be fearful of the impact it could be having on more traditional means of doing things. 31% believed technology was preventing us from communicating properly, while 32% thought advances in technology will result in long-held [[loss of tradition|traditions being lost]].

This fear has only been exacerbated over time as more and more data-holding, services and opportunities are transferred to the digital realm, and both the perceived and real nature of security and vulnerability risks increases.  Worrying levels of time spent on devices, the invasion of privacy or the possible misuse or [[data abuse|abuse]] of [[personal data]] entrusted to online sources are all contributing towards the development of a digital phobia among a proportion of the population.

Concerns about the negative, exclusionary or divisive consequences of living within a digital society are being voiced from various global platforms. April 2014 research conducted by [[Pew Research Center]], in association with [[Smithsonian Magazine]], revealed concerns about anticipated technological developments over the next half-century.  30% of Americans surveyed feared that technological changes would lead to a future in which people are worse off than they are at the time of being surveyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Aaron|last=Smith|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2014/04/17/us-views-of-technology-and-the-future/|title=Future of Technology - Pew Research Center|date=17 April 2014|work=Pew Research Center: Internet, Science &amp; Tech|accessdate=August 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Considered amid reports of dis-interest in the internet among Japan's residents despite its reputation as a high-tech nation, these reports contribute towards a growing understanding that high-tech advancements are not universally celebrated.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10543126.  Michael Fitzpatrick.  Revealing Japan's Low Tech Belly.  BBC News.  13 July 2010.  Accessed: 20 August 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the May 2014 "[[right to be forgotten]]" ruling put in place in the European Union which allows internet users to request for their internet history to be un-searchable if deemed incorrect, outdated or irrelevant, and the thousands of requests received in the first few days following its announcement documents a, perhaps previously hidden, widespread fear of leaving a digital footprint and/or being falsely represented online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/26/google-removing-right-to-be-forgotten-links|author=Charles Arthur|title=Google removing 'right to be forgotten' search links in Europe|journal=The Guardian|date=27 June 2014|accessdate=27 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Digital phobia is part of a wider societal conversation on how we relate to, trust in, and interact with technology and considers the potentially negative implications of what otherwise appears to be a positive advancement of the modern world. 
 
This phrase has been developed by Foresters, the international financial services organisation, for the purpose of describing attitudes to technology among the UK population.

Developed within a digital vocabulary consisting of four other phrases ([[digital addict]], [[digital omnivore]], digital agnostic, digital denier), digital phobic is part of a scale of social description for online behavior within the digital age.

The phrase has been used as part of discussion on the more general use of technology within the 21st century and the importance of striking a balance between time spent on and offline.  Research conducted by Foresters in association with Tech Timeout,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://techtimeout.com/|title=Tech Timeout|work=Tech Timeout|accessdate=October 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a social communications initiative considering the role of technology in contemporary society, formed the basis of the descriptor and identified the key traits of each type of digital user based on answers from over 1,000 UK respondents. 
 
Both anecdotal and research-based evidence suggests categories of internet use, whilst they cannot be linearly divided, are able to loosely describe attitudes to technology in society.  The developed phrases are able to be used to greater understand and contextualize how new and existing technology is viewed and have been cited in international [[online newspaper]]s and [[blog post]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/technology/news/article.cfm?c_id=5&amp;objectid=11270004.|title=Digital addict - spending an 'unhealthy' amount of time online|work=The New Zealand Herald|date=June 8, 2014|accessdate=August 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst this phrase and definition were developed specifically from research on UK technology-users, the phrase is not UK-specific and is designed to be indicative of a global community of technology users who share in these characteristics.

==Social and cultural impact==
Digital phobia presents a real and pressing problem in the modern world where technology has become a central and essential resource.  [[Internet culture]] has developed to become a part of the fabric of [[everyday life]] and is now even considered part of the make-up of [[national identity]] with a country's internet use and [[digital footprint]] an important modern index for international comparison, often associated with development and [[modernity]].

The consequences of [[non-participation]] in the digital world are far reaching, and can affect the economic, cultural, social, occupational and educational life of a non-user.  For example, in 2009 [[Price Waterhouse Coopers]] estimated that UK households offline are missing out on savings of £560 a year which could be saved if shopping or paying for bills online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalbirmingham.co.uk/downloads/pwc_report.pdf |format=PDF |work=Pricewaterhouse Coopers LLP. |title=Champion for Digital Inclusion: The Economic Case for Digital Inclusion |date=October 2009 |accessdate=August 27, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329114456/http://www.digitalbirmingham.co.uk/downloads/pwc_report.pdf |archivedate=March 29, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, in the United States older people without internet access or the skills to make the most of it are considered a disadvantaged proportion of the population as, amongst other important resources, vital healthcare information and initiatives conducted online are unavailable to those not a part of the digital world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Kaitlin |last=Roberts|url=http://theweek.com/article/index/262309/how-the-digital-divide-hurts-the-elderly-in-times-of-crisis|title=How the digital divide hurts the elderly in times of crisis|work=theweek.com|date=May 30, 2014|accessdate=June 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heightened fears of how technology may be affecting the human population stems from a, for some very logical, fear of how technology is adapting the world we live in and at the pace and price with which it is doing so.  With such a significance placed on [[online participation]], concerns about the role of the internet in everyday life are not unfounded and not exclusive to those who prefer to stay away from the internet, avoid certain activities online, or use the internet without enthusiasm and only as necessitated.

A survey conducted by security firm [[Avira]] identified 84% of people fear [[social networking site]]s will steal or misuse their personal information,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Matt |last=Liebowitz|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/47264062/ns/technology_and_science-security/t/people-fear-social-media/%20-%20.U5rM8yxOXL8#.U6rR8SxOXL8|title=84% of People Fear Social Media|work=msnbc.com|date= February 5, 2012|accessdate=June 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrating the net majority of internet users share, at least partially, in distrusting the digital world. Whilst many will, despite this fear, adopt cautious optimism and still use social networking as part of their everyday lives this high percentage serves to demonstrate that a fear significant enough for some to avoid readily using online and [[digital service]]s is a fear shared by a large number of internet users.

Whilst some digital phobics have preferred to remain distanced from technology due to hypothetical concerns others have attempted to join in societal interest but find themselves unable to stay caught up with new technology or would like to see its progression halted as evolution of the [[digital world]] has reached new speeds. The 2013 [[Oxford Internet Survey]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxis.oii.ox.ac.uk/sites/oxis.oii.ox.ac.uk/files/content/files/publications/OxIS_2013.pdf |format=PDF |first1=William H. |last1=Dutton |first2=Grant |last2=Blank |title=Cultures of the Internet: The Internet in Britain |work=The Oxford Internet Survey 2013 |accessdate=June 24, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140602045751/http://oxis.oii.ox.ac.uk/sites/oxis.oii.ox.ac.uk/files/content/files/publications/OxIS_2013.pdf |archivedate=June 2, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; recognizes this concern among UK users, identifying distinct categories of both non-users and ex-users of internet-based technology who, for a variety of reasons, have discontinued or refuse to access the online world.  This is further supported by results from a 2013 survey of internet use in America&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Kathryn |last=Zickuhr|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2013/09/25/whos-not-online-and-why/|title=Who's Not Online and Why|date=25 September 2013|work=Pew Research Center: Internet, Science &amp; Tech|accessdate=August 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which found 32% of non-internet users avoiding the online world because of finding the internet difficult or frustrating to use, being physically unable or worried about other issues such as viruses, threat of hacking or spam – a figure considerably higher than in earlier years.

Concern over the presence of a [[digital divide]], whether locally or globally, is only exacerbated by the knowledge that access to many government and council services, [[job application]]s, and social and cultural resources are now largely internet based. [[Internet access]] has become a hurdle in contemporary society which, for those without the necessary desire to learn or knowledge of internet-based systems, can be difficult to navigate around, often resulting in key services and vital resources being less easily accessible, leaving non-users feeling isolated.  Private and government campaigns to tackle this issue further demonstrate the severity and long-lasting impact of having a proportion of the population disinclined or disinterested in going online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Jenny |last=Hirschkon|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sponsored/finance/your-bank/10890366/elderly-help-internet.html|title=Connecting the elderly with internet know-how|date=June 12, 2014|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=June 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Kathy |last=Settle|url=https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2014/04/14/digital-inclusion-strategy-launches-today/|title=Digital Inclusion Strategy launches today|work=blog.gov.uk|date=April 14, 2014| accessdate=June 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the online world becomes saturated, device options for connecting to the internet vary and news of technological inventions goes [[viral marketing|viral]] the [[exponential growth]] of the technological world is only contributing towards a growing number of 'digital phobic' tech-users amongst the [[global population]].

== Education ==
Digital phobia has had a negative impact on the field of education. Some teachers have expressed a fear that new and advanced technology is supplanting them as the masters of their fields of study and a study of teachers in Wilmington, Delaware has shown that educators in this area are acclimating to the new technology in their classrooms at a slower pace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2015/06/11/why-ed-tech-is-not-transforming-how.html|title=Why Ed Tech Is Not Transforming How Teachers Teach|work=Education Week|access-date=2017-12-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The local researchers believe that there are many factors why that is the case and some of the things they have found are things such as a lack of technological education by the teachers, and also the lack of time, or incentive to adjust to the new technology. University Larry Cuban has stated that "The introduction of computers into school was supposed to improve academic achievement , and alter how teachers taught. Neither has occurred."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2015/06/11/why-ed-tech-is-not-transforming-how.html|title=Why Ed Tech Is Not Transforming How Teachers Teach|work=Education Week|access-date=2017-12-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The constant infusion of new technology has many teachers fearing that they are losing their classroom. This new technology is essentially diminishing the role of a teacher in the classroom.

Researchers believe that educators are slow to adapt to technology because they aren't given time to acclimate to the new technology, causing them to hesitate to use it in the classroom and express fear that these technologies may interfere with genuine learning particularly in humanities and creative subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2005/sep/13/schools.news1|title=Report reveals teachers' fear of classroom technology|last=Curtis|first=Polly|date=2005-09-13|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-12-06|last2=correspondent|first2=education|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article for the ''New Media Reader,'' Theodor H. Nelson wrote that people are opposed to the computer because they believe it is "cold" and "inhuman", but a human can be just as inhuman and maybe even more so than the actual machine itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/50096832|title=The NewMediaReader|date=2003|publisher=MIT Press|others=Wardrip-Fruin, Noah., Montfort, Nick.|isbn=9780262232272|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=50096832}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In San Francisco, the first ever Faux Queen [[Beauty contest|pageant]] was produced as a benefit by Diet Popstitute&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alvinorloff.com/webstitute.html Diet Popstitute, aka Michael Joseph Collins; 1958 - 1995] Alvin Orloff&lt;/ref&gt; and the first title holder was Coca Dietetica aka Laurie Bushman.  The Klubstitute Kollective&lt;ref name="Kollective"/&gt; was formed after Diet Popstitute's death to continue to raise funds and provide a space for the performers who, at the time, weren't always welcome in regular drag venues. Pageant organizer Ruby Toosday had "friends who got fired (from drag clubs) for being women...it seemed like we had definitely hit a nerve.&lt;ref name="impersonator"/&gt; Contestants were judged on drag, talent, and personality by an all-star panel of judges&lt;ref name=judges&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sfbg.com/36/28/x_8days.html | title= Eight Days A Week - Glam it up| accessdate=2007-06-01 |publisher=SF Bay Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the winner helped "femcee" the following year. The pageants were held from 1996 to 2005. The Faux Queen Pageant was resurrected in 2012 by former title holder Bea Dazzler, and will continue to be a yearly competition in San Francisco.

Fauxnique (dancer &amp; performance artist Monique Jenkinson) became the first faux queen to win a major drag pageant—competing against male or MTF drag queens—when she was crowned Miss [[Trannyshack]] 2003. From [[Bust Magazine]]: "'(drag) comes down to a sort of self-awareness, a self-consciousness about playing around with femininity,' says Fauxnique. She adds that while drag for her is primarily about performance, it's also a 'rejection of traditional oppressive forms of masculinity—and that's part of an affinity with gay men as well. I wouldn't say every faux queen is a feminist, but I would say that a part of them is in some way.'"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fauxnique.net/in_bust.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s and 1980s, [[Russian people|Russian]]-born [[Brazil]]ian faux queen [[Elke Maravilha]] became a popular TV personality after participating as a judge in [[Chacrinha]] and [[Silvio Santos]] talent shows. According to her, "many people think I am a [[transvestite]]. When they ask me this, I jokingly reply that I'm a man indeed. And of the most [[human penis size|gifted]] ones".&lt;ref&gt;Neves, Carla (September 16, 2007). [http://celebridades.uol.com.br/ultnot/2007/09/16/ult4233u146.jhtm ""Quando me perguntam se sou travesti, digo que sou homem, e dos mais dotados", brinca Elke Maravilha"] {{pt icon}}.

The comedy films ''[[Connie and Carla]]''&lt;ref name=connie&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.connieandcarla.com | title=Connie and Carla | accessdate=2007-06-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Victor Victoria]]'' both centre on faux queens, but the main characters of both films are women who are forced by circumstance to work as faux queens. They keep their gender a secret and impersonate men when off-stage, quite unlike their real-life counterparts.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
Around the year 1000, the [[County of Brussels]] became a part of the [[Duchy of Brabant]] (and therefore of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]) with Brussels as one of the four capitals of the Duchy, along with [[Leuven]], [[Antwerp]], and [['s-Hertogenbosch]]. Dutch was the sole language of Brussels, as was the case in the other three cities. Not all of Brabant, however, was Dutch-speaking. The area south of Brussels, around the town of [[Nivelles]], was a French-speaking area roughly corresponding to the modern province of [[Walloon Brabant]].&lt;ref name="mythe"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paulderidder.be/print/taalgebruik.pdf |title=De mythe van de vroege verfransing — Taalgebruik te Brussel van de 12de eeuw tot 1794 |author=Paul De Ridder |publisher=Paul De Ridder |accessdate=2009-01-16 |language=nl |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218230114/http://www.paulderidder.be/print/taalgebruik.pdf |archivedate=2008-12-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially in Brussels as well as other parts of Europe, [[Latin language|Latin]] was used as an official language. From the late 13th century, people began to shift usage to the [[vernacular]].  This occurrence took place in Brussels and then in other Brabantian cities, which had all eventually transformed by the 16th century. Official city orders and proclamations were thenceforth gradually written in [[Middle Dutch]]. Until the late 18th century, Dutch remained the administrative language of the Brussels area of the Duchy of Brabant. As part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], Brabantian cities enjoyed many freedoms, including choice of language.&lt;ref name="mythe"/&gt; Before 1500, there were almost no French documents in the Brussels city archives. By comparison the cities in the neighboring County of Flanders such as [[Bruges]], [[Ghent]], [[Kortrijk]] and [[Ypres]] the percentage of French documents in city archives fluctuated between 30% and 60%. Such high level of French influence had not yet developed in the Dutch-speaking areas of the Duchy of Brabant, including Brussels.&lt;ref name="mythe"/&gt;

After the death of [[Joanna, Duchess of Brabant]], in 1406, the Duchy of Brabant became a part of the [[Duchy of Burgundy]] and the use of the French language slowly increased in the region.&lt;ref name="ernest"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ernestmandel.org/fr/ecrits/txt/1963/bruxelles.htm| title=Bruxelles, la Flandre, et le fédéralisme |author=Robert Sixte |work=La Gauche n°47 |publisher=Ernest Mandel — Archives internet |date=1963-12-06 |accessdate=2009-01-17|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1477, Burgundian duke [[Charles the Bold]] perished in the [[Battle of Nancy]]. Through the marriage of his daughter [[Mary of Burgundy]] to Holy Roman Emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]], the [[Low Countries]] fell under [[Habsburg]] sovereignty. Brussels became the capital of the [[Burgundian Netherlands]], also known as the [[Seventeen Provinces]]. After the death of Mary in 1482 her son [[Philip I of Castile|Philip the Handsome]] succeeded as the Duke of Brabant. In 1506 he became the king of [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]], and hence the period of the [[Spanish Netherlands]] began.

===Spanish rule===
[[Image:Brussel 1555 Deventer.jpg|thumb|right|Brussels in 1555, still a small city that had not yet grown to fill [[Fortifications of Brussels|its walls]], the present-day [[Small ring (Brussels)|Small Ring]]]]
After 1531, Brussels was known as the Princely Capital of the [[Spanish Netherlands|Netherlands]]. After the division of the Netherlands resulting from the [[Eighty Years' War]] and in particular from the [[Fall of Antwerp (1584-1585)|fall of Antwerp]] to the Spanish forces, the economic and cultural centers of the Netherlands migrated to the northern [[Dutch Republic]]. About 150,000 people, mainly stemming from the intellectual and economic elites, fled to the north.&lt;ref name="vroeger"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JOo9oNIUcFUC |title=Het Nederlands vroeger en nu |author=Guy Janssens |author2=Ann Marynissen |year=2005 |publisher=ACCO |isbn=90-334-5782-2 |accessdate=2009-01-16|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brabant and Flanders were engulfed in the [[Counter-Reformation]], and the Catholic priests continued to perform the [[Mass (liturgy)|liturgy]] in Latin.

Dutch was seen as the language of [[Calvinism]] and was thus considered to be anti-Catholic.&lt;ref name="ernest"/&gt; In the context of the [[Counter-Reformation]], many clerics of the Low Countries had to be educated at the French-speaking [[University of Douai]].&lt;ref name="ULB"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ulb.ac.be/philo/spf/langue/francais.htm |title=Le français en Wallonnie et à Bruxelles aux XVIIe et XVIIIe siècles  |author=Daniel Droixhe |publisher=[[Université Libre de Bruxelles]] (ULB) |date=2002-04-13 |accessdate=2008-04-02 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080111204248/http://www.ulb.ac.be/philo/spf/langue/francais.htm |archivedate = January 11, 2008 |authorlink= Elmore D|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Dutch was not utterly excluded in the religious domain. For instance, [[Ferdinand Brunot]] reported that, 1638 in Brussels, the [[Jesuit]]s "[[sermon|preached]] three times a week in Flemish and twice in French".&lt;ref name="ULB"/&gt; While Dutch became standardized by the Dutch Republic, dialects continued to be spoken in the south.&lt;ref name="treffers"/&gt; As in other places in Europe during the 17th century, French grew as a language of the nobility and upper class of society.&lt;ref name="berlijn"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://neon.niederlandistik.fu-berlin.de/langvar/dutchbelgium/ |title=Vlaanderen tot 1914 |work=Nederlands Online (neon) |publisher=[[Free University of Berlin]] (FU Berlin) |date=2004-06-27 |accessdate=2009-01-16 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080617002714/http://neon.niederlandistik.fu-berlin.de/langvar/dutchbelgium/ |archivedate = June 17, 2008|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mandel"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ernestmandel.org/fr/ecrits/txt/1958/perspectives_socialistes_sur_la_question_flamand.htm |title=Perspectives socialistes sur la question flamande |author=[[Ernest Mandel]] |author2=Jacques Yerna |work=La Gauche n°16 |publisher=Ernest Mandel — Archives internet |date=1958-04-19 |accessdate=2009-01-17|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The languages used in the central administration during this time were both French and, to a lesser extent, Spanish.&lt;ref name="mythe"/&gt; Some French-speaking nobility established themselves in the hills of Brussels (in the areas of [[Coudenberg]] and [[Zavel (Brussels)|Zavel]]), bringing with them primarily French-speaking [[Walloons|Walloon]] personnel. This attracted a considerable number of other Walloons to Brussels who came either in search of work. This Walloon presence led to the adoption of [[Walloon language|Walloon]] words in the Brussels flavor of [[Brabantian|Brabantian Dutch]], but the Walloon presence was still too small to prevent them from being assimilated into the Dutch-speaking majority.&lt;ref name="mythe"/&gt;

===Austrian rule===
Following the [[Treaty of Utrecht]], the Spanish sovereignty over the Southern Netherlands was transferred to the Austrian branch of the [[House of Habsburg]]. This event started the era of the [[Austrian Netherlands]].
[[Image:Verhandeling verlooy.jpg|First page of [[Jan-Baptist Verlooy|Verlooy's]] ''Dissertation on the disregard of the native language in the Netherlands'' (1788), regarded as the first work dealing with the language problem in Flanders.&lt;ref&gt;Original title: ''Verhandeling op d’onacht der moederlyke tael in de Nederlanden''&lt;/ref&gt;|thumb]]
In the 18th century, there were already complaints about the waning use of Dutch in Brussels, which had been reduced to the status of "street language".&lt;ref name="reiziger"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ned"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ned.univie.ac.at/publicaties/taalgeschiedenis/nl/brussel.htm |title=Het Nederlands in Brussel |work=Geschiedenis van het Nederlands |publisher=NEDWEB — [[University of Vienna]] |accessdate=2009-01-16 |language=nl |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080630061502/http://www.ned.univie.ac.at/publicaties/taalgeschiedenis/nl/brussel.htm |archivedate=2008-06-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There were various reasons for this. The repressive policies of the Habsburgs after the division of the Low Countries and the following exodus of the intellectual elite towards the Dutch Republic left Flanders bereft of its social upper class. After the end of the 17th century [[Dutch Golden Age]] and the [[Dutch Republic]] went into decline, Dutch lost even more prestige as a language for politics, culture, and business. Meanwhile, French culture was spreading fast.&lt;ref name="marynissen"/&gt; For instance, the [[la Monnaie|La Monnaie Theater]] showed 95% of plays in French by the middle of the 18th century.&lt;ref name="ULB"/&gt; During the [[War of the Austrian Succession]], between 1745 and 1749, Brussels was under French rule.&lt;ref name="mythe"/&gt; Under these circumstances, especially after 1780, French became the adopted language of much of the Flemish [[bourgeoisie]],&lt;ref name="mythe"/&gt; who were later pejoratively labelled ''[[Franskiljon]]s'' (loosely: ''little Frenchies''). The lower classes got progressively poorer, and, by 1784, 15% of the population was in poverty.&lt;ref name="reiziger"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethesis.net/reizigers/reizigers_deel_e.htm |title=De visie van reizigers op Brabant en Mechelen (1701-1800) |author=Thomas De Wolf |work=Licentiaatsverhandelingen on-line |publisher=[[Ghent University]] |year=2003–2004 |accessdate=2009-01-17|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; The small French-speaking minority was quite affluent and constituted the social upper class.&lt;ref name="ulaval"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tlfq.ulaval.ca/axl/europe/belgiqueetat_histoire.htm |title=Petite histoire de la Belgique et ses conséquences linguistiques |author=Jacques Leclerc (associated member of the [[Trésor de la langue française au Québec]]) |work=L'aménagement linguistique dans le monde |publisher=[[Université Laval]] |date=2008-11-09 |accessdate=2009-01-16|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The percentage of the Brussels population using French in public life was between 5 and 10 percent in 1760, increasing to 15 percent in 1780.&lt;ref name="ULB"/&gt; According to authenticated archives and various official documents, it appears that a fifth of municipal declarations and official orders were written in French. Twenty years later this rose to a quarter; however, over half of the official documents in French originated in the French-speaking bourgeoisie, who made up just a tenth of the population. In 1760 small businesses and [[artisan]]s wrote only 4 percent of their documents in French; by 1780 this had risen to 13 percent.&lt;ref name="nlb"/&gt; In private life, however, Dutch was still by far the most-used language.&lt;ref name="ULB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nlb"&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/toor004gesc01_01/toor004gesc01_01_0029.htm |chapter=Nederlands in België, Het Nederlands bedreigd en overlevend |author=G.

Following the [[French Revolutionary Wars: Campaigns of 1794|campaigns of 1794 in the French Revolutionary Wars]], the Low Countries were annexed by the [[First French Republic|French Republic]], ending Habsburg rule in the region. Catholics were heavily repressed by the French, and the French instituted heavy-handed policies that completely paralyzed the economy.

In the beginning of the 19th century the [[Napoleonic era|Napoleonic]] Office of Statistics found that Dutch was still the most frequently spoken language in both the Brussels arrondissement and [[Leuven]].

Immediately after the French invasion, the use of Dutch was forbidden in the [[Brussels city hall|city hall of Brussels]].&lt;ref name="nlb"/&gt; The Francization rules, instituted to unify the state, were aimed at the citizens who were to assume power from the nobility as was done in the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref name="nlb"/&gt; However, the French conquerors rapidly understood it was not possible to force local populations, speaking languages very different from French, to suddenly use French. The Francization of the Dutch-speaking parts of the Low Countries therefore remained limited to the higher levels of the local administration and upper class society.&lt;ref name="ULB"/&gt; The effect on lower social classes, of whom 60% were illiterate,&lt;ref name="nlb"/&gt; was small.&lt;ref name="berlijn"/&gt; Life on the streets was greatly affected as, by law, all notices, street names, etc. were required to be written in French,&lt;ref name="nlb"/&gt; and official documents were to be written solely in French, although "when needed", a non-legally-binding translation could be permitted.&lt;ref name="berlijn"/&gt; Simultaneously, businesses from the rural areas were told not to continue operating if they were not proficient in French.&lt;ref name="ULB"/&gt; In addition, the law stated that all court pleas, sentences, and other legal materials were to be written solely in French, unless practical considerations made this impossible.&lt;ref name="ULB"/&gt; These measures increased the percentage of official documents written in French from 60% around the start of the 19th century to 80% by 1813. Although mainly used by in higher social circles, a more appropriate measure of actual language use might include an observation of written testaments, three-fourths of which in 1804 were written in Dutch, indicating that the upper classes still mainly used Dutch around the start of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="ULB"/&gt;

[[File:William I of the Netherlands.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[William I of the Netherlands|King William I of the Netherlands]] tried to make Dutch the sole language of the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]].]]
In 1815, following the final defeat of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]], the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] was created by the [[Congress of Vienna]], joining the Southern Netherlands with the former Dutch Republic. Shortly after the formation of the new kingdom, at the request of Brussels businesses, Dutch once again became the official language of Brussels.&lt;ref name="nlb"/&gt; Nevertheless, the union of the Netherlands and Belgium did little to lessen the political and economic power of French in Flanders, where it remained the language of the aristocracy.&lt;ref name="NO"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://neon.niederlandistik.fu-berlin.de/langvar/statusdutch/index_html/nl#statusbelgium |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502162036/http://neon.niederlandistik.fu-berlin.de/langvar/statusdutch/index_html/nl#statusbelgium |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-05-02 |title=Het Nederlands: status en verspreiding |work=Nederlands Online (neon) |publisher=[[Free University of Berlin]] (FU Berlin) |date=2004-06-18 |accessdate=2009-01-16 |language=nl |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; Brussels and [[The Hague]] were dual capitals of the Kingdom, and in the [[House of Representatives of the Netherlands|parliament]] the Belgian delegates spoke only French. [[William I of the Netherlands|King William I]] wanted to develop present-day Flanders to the level of the Northern Netherlands, and instituted a wide network of schools in the local language of the people.&lt;ref name="mythe"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ulaval"/&gt; He made Dutch the single official language of the Flemish provinces, and this was also implemented in bilingual Brabant and Brussels. The Walloon provinces remained monolingually French.&lt;ref name="nlb"/&gt; The King hoped to make Dutch the sole language of the nation, but the French-speaking citizenry, the Catholic Church, and the Walloons resisted this move.&lt;ref name="ulaval"/&gt; The French-speaking population feared that their opportunities for participation in government were threatened, and that they would become unneeded elements of the new Kingdom. Under pressure from these groups, in 1830 King William I reintroduced a language freedom policy throughout all of present-day Belgium.&lt;ref name="demoulin"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mrw.wallonie.be/sg/dsg/dircom/walcartes/pages/car316.htm |title=La langue et la révolution de 1830 |author=Robert Demoulin |work=Unification politique, essor économique (1794-1914) — Histoire de la Wallonie |pages=313–322 |publisher=Wallonie en mouvement |accessdate=2009-01-16|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bauwens"&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://www.dmnet.be/ndf/main/fr/pgarfr/arfr174.html |title=Comment sortir du labyrinthe belge ? |author=Marcel Bauwens |year=1998–2005 |work=Nouvelles de Flandre [art 174] |publisher=Association pour la Promotion de Francophonie en Flandre (APFF) |accessdate=2009-01-18|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; This nullified the monolingual status of Brussels and the Flemish provinces.&lt;ref name="nlb"/&gt;

Important for the later development of the Dutch language was that the Flemish population experienced a certain amount of contact with the northern [[Dutch Language Union|Standard Dutch]] during the short reign of the kingdom.&lt;ref name="berlijn"/&gt; The Catholic Church viewed Dutch as a threatening element representative of [[Protestantism]], while the Francophone aristocracy still viewed Dutch as a language subordinate to French.&lt;ref name="bauwens"/&gt; These views helped contribute to the [[Belgian Revolution]] and to the creation of an independent and officially  monolingual Francophone [[Kingdom of Belgium]], established in 1830.&lt;ref name="berlijn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="digitaal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="demoulin"/&gt; This strong preference for French would have a great influence on language use in Brussels.

===Belgian Revolution===

Painting entitled ''Episode of the Belgian Revolution of 1830'' by [[Egide Charles Gustave Wappers|Wappers]]]]

After the Belgian revolution, the [[bourgeoisie]] in Brussels began to use French more and more. Numerous French and Walloon immigrants moved to Brussels, and for the first time in mass numbers the Flemish people began switching to French.&lt;ref name="ernest"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vl"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://brussel.vlaanderen.be/brusselhistorisch.html |title=Brussel historisch |work=Hoofdstedelijke Aangelegenheden |publisher=Ministry of the [[Flemish Community]] |accessdate=2009-01-17|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By October 16, 1830 King William I had already rescinded a policy that named Dutch as the official language of Brussels.&lt;ref name="FO"/&gt; The sole official language of the newly created centralized state was French, even though a majority of the population was Flemish.&lt;ref name="ulaval"/&gt; French became the language of the court, the administration, the army, the media, and of culture and education.&lt;ref name="vl"/&gt; With more French being spoken, societal progress, culture, and universalism gave it an aura of "respectibility".&lt;ref name="winkler"/&gt;  In contrast, Dutch garnered little consideration and was deemed a language for peasants, farmers, and poor workers.&lt;ref name="érudit"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.erudit.org/revue/rs/2002/v43/n3/000609ar.html |title=Le Québec entre la Flandre et la Wallonie : Une comparaison des nationalismes sous-étatiques belges et du nationalisme québécois |author=Jan Erk |year=2002 |work=Recherches sociographiques, vol 43, n°3 [499-516] |publisher=[[Université Laval]] |accessdate=2009-01-17|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the geographical language border between Flanders and Wallonia, there was in fact also a social language border between the Dutch-speakers and French-speakers.&lt;ref name="mandel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bauwens"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sociaal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.vlaanderen.be/ned/sites/taalwetgeving/sociale_taalgrens.html |title=De sociale taalgrens |work=Als goede buren: Vlaanderen en de taalwetgeving |year=1999 |publisher=Ministry of the [[Flemish Community]] |accessdate=2009-01-17|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; French was the language of politics and economics and a symbol of upward social mobility.&lt;ref name="brio"/&gt; French poet [[Charles Baudelaire]], during his short stay in Brussels, complained of the hypocrisy of the bourgeoisie at the time:&lt;ref name="rudi2"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.briobrussel.be/assets/bt8download.pdf |title=Taalgebruik in Brussel — Taalverhoudingen, taalverschuivingen en taalidentiteit in een meertalige stad |author=Rudi Janssens |year=2001 |work=19 keer Brussel; Brusselse Thema's (8) |publisher=VUBPress ([[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]], VUB) |isbn=90-5487-293-4  |accessdate=2009-01-16|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

C’est de bon goût. La preuve qu’ils le savent très bien, c’est qu’ils engueulent leurs domestiques en flamand.''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The new Belgian capital remained a mostly Dutch-speaking city, where the inhabitants spoke a local [[Brabantian|South Brabantian]] dialect. A minority of French-speaking citizens, mainly those who had immigrated from France during the previous decades, constituted 15% of the population.&lt;ref name="ulaval"/&gt; Despite this, the first mayor of Brussels after the revolution, [[Nicolas-Jean Rouppe]], declared French to be the sole language of administration.&lt;ref name="digitaal"/&gt; The political center of Brussels attracted the economic elite, and Brussels soon acquired French-speaking upper and middle classes.&lt;ref name="sociaal"/&gt; In 1846, 38% of the city declared themselves being French-speaking, while this percentage was 5% in [[Ghent]] and 2% in [[Antwerp]].&lt;ref name="brio"/&gt; Many supposed French-speakers were actually Flemish bourgeois with Dutch-speaking roots.&lt;ref name="brio3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.briobrussel.be/assets/Taal_sociale_integr_4.pdf |title=Taal- en onderwijspolitiek te Brussel (1878-1914) |author=Harry van Velthoven |year=1981 |work=Taal en Sociale Integratie, IV |publisher=[[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]] (VUB) |pages=261–387 |accessdate=2009-01-16|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1860, 95% of the Flemish population spoke Dutch, although these people had hardly any economic and political power&lt;ref name="ned2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ned.univie.ac.at/non/landeskunde/be/h12/vlaamse.htm |title=Geschiedenis van de Vlaamse Beweging |work=Cultuurkunde van België |publisher=NEDWEB — [[University of Vienna]] |accessdate=2009-01-16 |language=nl |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080418060732/http://www.ned.univie.ac.at/non/landeskunde/be/h12/vlaamse.htm |archivedate=2008-04-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and deemed a good knowledge of French necessary to attain higher social status and wealth.&lt;ref name="ernest"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ulaval"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vl"/&gt;

==Role of education==
Brussels attracted many immigrants from Flanders, where economic strife and hunger were widespread.&lt;ref name="sociaal"/&gt; Native Flemish Brussels residents harbored a sense of superiority over the other Flemish immigrants from the poor countryside, which manifested itself in the decision to speak the "superior" French language.&lt;ref name="brio"/&gt;

In two or three generations, the new immigrants themselves began to speak French.&lt;ref name="ernest"/&gt; A typical family might have Dutch-speaking grandparents, bilingual parents, and French-speaking children. The exclusively French educational system played an important role in this changing language landscape. Dutch was mainly ignored as a school subject. From 1842, Dutch was removed from the first four years of boys' schools, although in later school grades it could be studied. In girls' schools and Catholic schools Dutch was taught even less, even though Dutch was still the native tongue of a majority of the students.&lt;ref name="brio3"/&gt;

Just after the mayoral inauguration of [[Charles Buls]] in 1881, [[elementary school]]s that taught Dutch were reopened in 1883.&lt;ref name="digitaal"/&gt; In these schools, the first two years of lessons were given in Dutch, soon after which students transitioned into French-speaking classes.&lt;ref name="onderwijs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vgc.be/Onderwijs/Onderwijsbeleid+van+de+VGC/Over+het+Brussels+Nederlandstalig+onderwijs/geschiedenis.htm |title=Over het Brussels Nederlandstalig onderwijs |publisher=[[Flemish Community Commission]] (VGC) |accessdate=2009-01-17 |language=nl |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120114344/http://www.vgc.be/Onderwijs/Onderwijsbeleid+van+de+VGC/Over+het+Brussels+Nederlandstalig+onderwijs/geschiedenis.htm |archivedate=2012-11-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal by Buls was initially poorly received by the local councils, although they were later accepted when studies showed that when students had acquired a good understanding of Dutch, they more easily obtained French speaking skills. The dominance of French in education was not affected, since most schooling in later years was still in French.&lt;ref name="brio3"/&gt; Because of the authoritative position that French enjoyed in Belgium and the misconceptions of Buls' plan,&lt;ref name="brio3"/&gt; many Flemish children were still sent to French school in order to better master the language.&lt;ref name="ulaval"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vl"/&gt; This was made possible by the idea of "freedom of the head of household", which stipulated that parents were allowed to send their children to any school they wished, regardless of the child's mother tongue. Since most pupils were sent to French schools rather than Dutch schools, after the end of the [[First World War]] there was not a single Dutch class left in central Brussels. In the thirteen municipalities that constituted the Brussels metropolitan area, there were 441 Dutch classes and 1592 French classes, even though the French-speaking population made up just under one third of the total.&lt;ref name="onderwijs"/&gt;

As a result of the propagation of the bilingual education system, Dutch was no longer being passed down by many Flemish parents to their children.&lt;ref name="winkler"/&gt; French was beginning to be used more and more as the main language spoken at home by many Flemings.&lt;ref name="rudi2"/&gt; In Flanders, education played less of a role in Francization because most schools continued to teach in Dutch.&lt;ref name="kramer"/&gt;

==French-speaking immigration==
During the 19th century, many political asylum seekers sought refuge in Brussels, mainly coming from [[France]]. The first wave came in 1815 bringing [[Jacobin Club|Jacobins]] and [[Bonapartism|Bonapartists]]; a second wave came in 1848 bringing French republicans and [[Orléanist]]s, a third came after the [[French coup of 1851]], and a fourth came in 1871 after the [[Franco-Prussian War]].&lt;ref name="ulaval"/&gt; Asylum seekers and other immigrants also came from other parts of Europe such as Italy, Poland, Germany, and Russia. They preferred to speak French rather than Dutch when they arrived, which further intensified Francization.&lt;ref name="ulaval"/&gt;

As the capital of the new kingdom, Brussels also attracted a large number of Walloon migrants.&lt;ref name="mandel"/&gt; In contrast to Flemish citizens of Brussels, who came primarily from the lower social classes, the Walloon newcomers belonged mainly to the middle class.&lt;ref name="jaumain"/&gt; The Walloon and French migrants lived predominantly in the [[Marollen]] district of Brussels, where [[Marols]], a mixture of Brabantian Dutch, French, and [[Walloon language|Walloon]], was spoken.&lt;ref name="winkler"/&gt; Despite the fact that many lower-class Walloons also made their way to Brussels, the perception of French as an intellectual and elite language did not change.&lt;ref name="brio"/&gt;
Additionally, Brussels received a considerable number of French-speaking members of the Flemish bourgeoisie.&lt;ref name="brio4"/&gt;

Between 1830 and 1875 the population of the city of Brussels grew from approximately 100,000 to 180,000;&lt;ref name="brio3"/&gt; the population of the metropolitan area soared to 750,000 by 1910.&lt;ref name="FO"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.flandersonline.org/nl/flanders/5/70 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021194233/http://www.flandersonline.org/nl/flanders/5/70 |archivedate=2007-10-21 |title=Brussel verfranst in de 19&lt;sup&gt;de&lt;/sup&gt; eeuw |author=Flanders Online |publisher=Vlaams Dienstencentrum vzw |accessdate=2009-01-18|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early Flemish movement in Brussels==
[[File:VlaamseStrijdvlag.svg|thumb|right|Flag of the [[Flemish Movement]]]]
{{See also|Flemish Movement}}

In contrast to the rest of Flanders, French in Brussels was seen less as a means of oppression but rather as a tool for social progress. In the first decade after the independence of Belgium, the neglect of Dutch language and culture gradually caused increasingly greater dissatisfaction in the Flemish community. In 1856 the "Grievances Commission" was established to investigate the problems of the Flemings. It was devoted to making the administration, military, educational system and judicial system bilingual, but was politically ignored.&lt;ref name="vub"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vub.ac.be/vlaamsestudenteninbrussel/documenten/pedagogischdossier.pdf |title=Dossier "150 jaar Vlaamse studenten in Brussel" |author=UVV Info |year=2005 |publisher=[[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]] (VUB) |accessdate=2009-01-17 |language=nl |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another group to decry the problems of the Flemings was "Vlamingen Vooruit" ("Flemings Forward"), founded in 1858 in [[Saint-Josse-ten-Noode]].  Members included [[Charles Buls]], [[mayor of Brussels]], and [[Léon Vanderkindere]], mayor of [[Uccle]].&lt;ref name="digitaal"/&gt;  Although Brussels was 57 percent Dutch-speaking in 1880, Flemish primary schools were prohibited until 1883. In 1884, the municipal government decided to allow birth, death, and marriage certificates to be written in Dutch.  However, only a tenth of the population made use of these opportunities, suggesting that in the minds of Brussels residents, French was the normal way of conducting these matters.&lt;ref name="nlb2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/toor004gesc01_01/toor004gesc01_01_0030.htm |title=De taalpolitieke ontwikkelingen in België |author=G. Geerts |work=Geschiedenis van de Nederlandse taal |publisher=M.C. van den Toorn, W. Pijnenburg, J.A. van Leuvensteijn and J.M. van der Horst|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1889 Dutch was once again allowed in courtrooms, but only for use in oral [[testimony]].&lt;ref name="ulaval"/&gt;

In the late 19th century, the Flemish movement gained even more strength and demanded Belgium be made bilingual. This proposal was rejected by French-speakers,&lt;ref name="berlijn"/&gt; who feared a "Flemishification" of Wallonia as well as the prospect of having to learn Dutch in order to obtain a job in the civil service.&lt;ref name="ulaval"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eeuw"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.vlaanderen.be/ned/sites/taalwetgeving/eeuw_taalwetten.html |title=Een eeuw taalwetten |work=Als goede buren: Vlaanderen en de taalwetgeving |year=1999 |publisher=Ministry of the [[Flemish Community]] |accessdate=2009-01-17|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Flemings adapted their goals to the realities of the situation, and devoted themselves to a monolingual Flanders,&lt;ref name="vl"/&gt; which Brussels was still socially a part of.&lt;ref name="ernest"/&gt;  The Flemings hoped to limit the spread of French in Flanders by restricting the areas in which French was an official language. In 1873 in the [[Sint-Jans-Molenbeek]] district of Brussels, Flemish laborer Jozef Schoep refused to accept a French-language birth certificate. He was ordered to pay a fine of 50 [[Belgian franc|francs]]. His case generated considerable controversy and shortly thereafter the [[Linguistic legislation in Belgium#1873: the first laws on the use of languages|Coremans Law]] was introduced, which allowed Dutch to be used by Dutch-speakers in court.&lt;ref name="gent"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.ugent.be/decaan/geschiedenis/1-hoofdstuk-3.html#_ednref390 |title=De Universiteit in de kering 1876-1930 |author=Liesbet Vandersteene |work=Geschiedenis van de faculteit Rechtsgeleerdheid |publisher=[[Ghent University]] |date=2006-01-03 |accessdate=2009-01-17 |language=nl |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613095905/http://www.law.ugent.be/decaan/geschiedenis/1-hoofdstuk-3.html |archivedate=June 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, the Flemish movement in Brussels did not garner much support for its plans regarding the use of Dutch. Each attempt to promote Dutch and limit the expansion of French influence as a symbol of social status was seen as a means to stifle social mobility rather than as a protective measure as it was seen in the rest of Flanders.&lt;ref name="brio"/&gt;  Whereas in other Flemish cities such as [[Ghent]] in which the Flemish laborers were dominated by a French-speaking upper class, in Brussels it was not as easy to make such a distinction because so many Walloons made up a large portion of the working class. The linguistic heterogeneity, combined with the fact that the most of the upper class of workers spoke French, meant that the class struggle for most workers in Brussels was not seen as a language struggle as well. Ever since the start of the 20th century, the workers movement in Brussels defended bilingualism, so as to have a means of emancipation for the local working class. This, along with the educational system, facilitated the Francization of thousands of Brussels residents.&lt;ref name="brio4"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.briobrussel.be/assets/andere%20publicaties/btng-rbhc,%2021,%201990,%203-4,%20pp%20383-412.pdf |title=Thuis in gescheiden werelden — De migratoire en sociale aspecten van verfransing te Brussel in het midden van de 19e eeuw |author=Machteld de Metsenaere  |year=1990 |work=BTNG-RBHC, XXI, 1990, n° 3-4 [383-412] |publisher=[[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]] (VUB) |accessdate=2009-01-16|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early language laws==
{{See also|Language legislation in Belgium}}
[[Image:Bruxelles-Brussel.jpg|left|thumb|French and Dutch are both official languages in the [[Brussels-Capital Region]]]]

By the 1870s, most municipalities were administered in French.  With the [[Language legislation in Belgium#1878: the second law on the use of languages|De Laet law]] in 1878, a gradual change started to occur. From that point forward, in the provinces of [[Limburg (Belgium)|Limburg]], [[Antwerp (province)|Antwerp]], [[West Flanders]] and [[East Flanders]], and in the arrondissement of [[Leuven]], all public communication was given in Dutch or in both languages.  For the arrondissement of Brussels, documents could be requested in Dutch.&lt;ref name="luc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://home.lvb.net/rechtstoestand7 |title=Tweede en derde taalwet |author=Luc Van Braekel |year=2003 |accessdate=2009-01-17 |language=nl |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050103191851/http://home.lvb.net/rechtstoestand7 |archivedate=2005-01-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless, by 1900 most large Flemish cities, cities along the language border, and the municipalities of the Brussels metropolitan area were still administered in French.&lt;ref name="OVV"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ovv.be/page.php?ID=1971 |title=Sint-Stevens-Woluwe: een unicum in de Belgische geschiedenis |author=Johan Slembrouck |date=2007-08-02 |publisher=Overlegcentrum van Vlaamse Verenigingen (OVV) |accessdate=2009-01-17|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921 the [[territoriality principle]] was recognized, which solidified the outline of the Belgian language border.&lt;ref name="carrefour"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carrefour.be/histoire.htm |title=Histoire des discriminations linguistiques ou pour motifs linguistiques, contre les francophones de la périphérie bruxelloise (de 120.000 à 150.000 citoyens belges) |date=2007-11-08 |work=Histoire |publisher=Carrefour |accessdate=2009-01-17 |language=fr |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310003827/http://www.carrefour.be/histoire.htm |archivedate=2009-03-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Flemings hoped that such a language border would help to curb the influx of French in Flanders.  Belgium became divided into three language areas: a monolingual Dutch-speaking area in the north ([[Flanders]]), a monolingual French-speaking area in the south ([[Wallonia]]), and a bilingual area (Brussels), even though the majority of Brussels residents spoke primarily Dutch.&lt;ref name="ulaval"/&gt;  The municipalities in the Brussels metropolitan region, the bilingual region of Belgium, could freely choose either language to be used in administrative purposes.  The town government of [[Sint-Stevens-Woluwe]], which lies in present-day [[Flemish Brabant]], was the only one to opt for Dutch over French.&lt;ref name="OVV"/&gt;

==Language censuses==
The [[Linguistic legislation in Belgium#A bilingual nation or languages linked to a region|language law of 1921]] was elaborated upon by a further law in 1932. Dutch was made an official language within the central government, the (then) four Flemish provinces, as well as the arrondissements of Leuven and Brussels (excepting the Brussels metropolitan area as a whole). The law also stipulated that municipalities on the language border or near Brussels would be required to provide services in both languages when the minority exceeded 30%, and the administrative language of a municipality would be changed if the language minority grew to greater than 50%.&lt;ref name="carrefour"/&gt;  This was to be regulated by a language [[census]] every ten years,&lt;ref name="wem"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mrw.wallonie.be/sg/dsg/dircom/walcartes/pages/txt322.htm |title=Frontière linguistique, frontière politique |publisher=Wallonie en mouvement |accessdate=2009-01-17|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the validity of the results from Flanders were frequently questioned.&lt;ref name="knack"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.knack.be/nieuws/belgie/de-belgische-troebelen/site72-section24-article9689.html |title=De Belgische troebelen |publisher=[[Knack (magazine)|Knack]] |date=2007-11-12 |accessdate=2009-01-16 |language=nl |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080327055341/http://www.knack.be/nieuws/belgie/de-belgische-troebelen/site72-section24-article9689.html |archivedate=2008-03-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1932, Sint-Stevens-Woluwe, now a part of the [[Zaventem]] municipality, became the first municipality in Belgian history to secede from the bilingual Brussels metro region because the French-speaking minority percentage fell to below 30%.&lt;ref name="OVV"/&gt; This did not sit well with some French-speakers in Brussels, some of whom formed a group called the "Ligue contre la flamandisation de Bruxelles" (League against the Flemishification of Brussels), which campaigned against what they saw as a form of "Flemish tyranny".  Before the introduction of French as an official language of [[Ganshoren]] and [[Sint-Agatha-Berchem]], the group also objected to the bilingual status of [[Ixelles]].  The group also strongly defended the [[Francization of Brussels#Role of education|"freedom of the head of household"]], a major factor in the process of Francization.&lt;ref name="affiches"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tlfq.ulaval.ca/axl/europe/belgique_affiche-1832.htm |title=La " tyrannie flamingante " vue par les francophones |author=Paul Tourret |year=2001 |work=Affiches publiées par la « Ligue contre la flamandisation de Bruxelles »|publisher=[[Université Laval]] |accessdate=2009-01-25|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution in the City of Brussels proper===
[[Image:StElizabethChurchHaren.jpg|right|thumb|[[Haren, Belgium|Haren]], one of the small Brabantian and initially largely Dutch-speaking villages that became part of the Brussels metropolitan area.]]
While the Brussels metropolitan area grew quickly, the population of the [[City of Brussels]] proper declined considerably.  In 1910, Brussels had 185,000 inhabitants; in 1925 this number fell to 142,000.  Reasons for this depopulation were manifold.  First, the fetid stench of the disease-laden [[Senne]] river caused many to leave the city.&lt;ref name="urbanisme"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethesis.net/urbanisme/urbanisme_hfst_1.htm |title=Urbanisme in Brussel, 1830-1860 |author=Edwin Smellinckx |work=Licentiaatsverhandelingen on-line |publisher=[[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]] (KULeuven) |year=2000–2001 |accessdate=2009-01-17|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Second, cholera broke out in 1832 and 1848,&lt;ref name="urbanisme"/&gt; which led to the [[covering of the Senne|Senne being completely covered over]].  Third, the rising price of property and rental rates caused many inhabitants to search for affordable living situations elsewhere.  Higher taxes on patents, which were up to 30% higher than those in neighboring municipalities, stifled economic development and drove up the cost of city living.  These higher patent prices were abandoned in 1860. Finally, the industrialization that occurred in the neighboring areas drew workers out of the city.  These social changes helped speed the process of Francization in the central city.&lt;ref name="ogen"/&gt; In 1920, three bordering municipalities, each having a large number of Dutch-speaking inhabitants, were amalgamated into the City of Brussels.

According to the language census of 1846, 61% of Brussels residents spoke Dutch and 39% spoke French.  The census of 1866 permitted residents to answer "both languages", although it was unstated whether this meant "knowledge of both languages" or "use of both languages", nor whether or not either was the resident's mother tongue.  In any case, 39% answered Dutch, 20% French, and 38% "both languages".&lt;ref name="brio"/&gt;  In 1900, the percentage of monolingual French-speakers overtook the percentage of monolingual Dutch-speakers, although this was most likely caused by the growing number of bilingual speakers.&lt;ref name="nlb2"/&gt;  Between 1880 and 1890, the percentage of bilingual speakers rose from 30% to 50%, and the number of monolingual Dutch-speakers declined from 36% in 1880 to 17% in 1910.&lt;ref name="brio3"/&gt;  Although the term "bilingual" was misused by the government to showcase the large number of French-speakers,&lt;ref name="brio3"/&gt; it is clear that French gained acceptance in both the public and private lives of Dutch-speaking Brussels residents.&lt;ref name="nlb2"/&gt;

===Expansion of the metropolitan area===
Beyond the city of Brussels, the municipalities of [[Ixelles]], [[Saint-Gilles, Belgium|Saint-Gilles]], [[Etterbeek]], [[Forest, Belgium|Forest]], [[Watermael-Boitsfort]] and [[Saint-Josse]] saw the most widespread adoption of the French language over the following century. In Ixelles, the proportion of Dutch monolinguals fell from 54% to 3% between 1846 and 1947, while during in the same time the proportion of monolingual Francophones grew from 45% to 60%.  Whereas in 1846 Saint-Gilles was still 83% Dutch-speaking, one hundred years later half of its population spoke only French, and 39% were bilingual.  Similarly, Etterbeek evolved from a 97% Dutch-speaking village to an urban neighborhood in which half of its inhabitants spoke only French. The same phenomenon applied to Forest and Watermael-Boitsfort, where they went from completely Dutch-speaking to half monolingual French and half bilingual, with monolingual Dutch-speakers at only 6%. In [[Saint-Josse-ten-Noode]], the proportion of monolingual Dutch-speakers equalled that of French-speakers in 1846, but by 1947 only 6% were monolingual Dutch-speakers, and 40% were monolingual French-speakers.

[[Image:Taalevolutie Brussel-EN.png|left|350px|thumb|The language censuses showed a simultaneous transition from the Dutch monolingualism to bilingualism and from the bilingualism to French monolingualism]]
In 1921 the metropolitan area was expanded further. The municipalities of [[Laeken|Laken]], [[Neder-Over-Heembeek]], and [[Haren, Belgium|Haren]] were incorporated into the municipality of Brussels, while [[Sint-Pieters-Woluwe]] became part of the bilingual agglomeration by law.&lt;ref name="OVV"/&gt; After the language census of 1947, [[Evere]], [[Ganshoren]], and [[Sint-Agatha-Berchem]] were added to the bilingual agglomeration, although the implementation of this change was postponed until 1954 due to Flemish pressure. This was the last enlargement of the agglomeration, which brought the number of municipalities in Brussels to 19. In the peripheral municipalities of [[Kraainem]], [[Linkebeek]], [[Drogenbos]], and [[Wemmel]], where a French-speaking minority of more than 30% existed, [[Municipalities with language facilities|language facilities]] were set up, although these municipalities officially remain in the Dutch language area.&lt;ref name="carrefour"/&gt;

The censuses on the use of languages in the municipalities of the Brussels-Capital Region have shown that by 1947 French was becoming the most spoken language. However, in 1947, the percentage of residents declaring themselves bilingual was 45%, the percentage of monolingual Dutch-speakers was 9% and the percentage of monolingual French-speakers was 38%. In practice the bilingual citizens were most of the time bilingual Flemings. They were nevertheless recorded as bilinguals and not as Dutch-speakers.&lt;ref name="nlb2"/&gt;

==Establishment of the language border==

[[File:Arrondissement Brussels-Periphery Belgium Map.PNG|thumb|right|The six [[municipalities with language facilities]] in the periphery of Brussels, shown within [[Flemish Brabant]]]]
After both a Flemish boycott of the language census of 1960 and two large Flemish protest marches in Brussels,&lt;ref name="knack"/&gt; the language border was solidified in 1962 and the recently taken language census was annulled. Various municipalities shifted from one language area to another, such as [[Voeren]], which became part of Flanders, and [[Comines-Warneton]] and [[Mouscron]] which became part of Wallonia. In both [[Wezembeek-Oppem]] and [[Sint-Genesius-Rode]], language facilities were established for French-speakers, who made up just under 30% of the population when the last language census in 1947 was taken.&lt;ref name="carrefour"/&gt;  Brussels was fixed at 19 municipalities, thus creating a bilingual enclave in otherwise monolingual Flanders.&lt;ref name="deweerdt"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haviko.org/perscommentaar_Vlaams/De_Tijd_arrestRVS_29-12-04.pdf |title=Raad van State beperkt toepassing faciliteiten in randgemeenten |author=Stefaan Huysentruyt |author2=Mark Deweerdt |date=2004-12-29 |publisher=[[De Tijd]] |accessdate=2009-01-16|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brussels was limited to the current 19 municipalities. Many French-speakers complained that this did not correspond to the social reality, since the language border was based on the results of the 1947 language census and not that of 1960. French-speaking sources claim that in that year, French-speaking minorities had surpassed the 30% threshold in [[Alsemberg]], [[Beersel]], [[Sint-Pieters-Leeuw]], [[Dilbeek]], [[Strombeek-Bever]], [[Sterrebeek]], and [[Sint-Stevens-Woluwe]],&lt;ref name="carrefour"/&gt; in which case French-language facilities should have been established under previous legislation. A political rift developed because French-speakers considered the language facilities as an essential right, while the Flemings saw the facilities as a temporary, transitional measure to allow the French-speaking minorities time to adapt to their Flemish surroundings.&lt;ref name="carrefour"/&gt;&lt;ref name="deweerdt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ulaval2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tlfq.ulaval.ca/AXL/europe/belgiquefla.htm |title=La Communauté flamande de Belgique |author=Jacques Leclerc (associated member of the [[Trésor de la langue française au Québec]]) |work=L'aménagement linguistique dans le monde |publisher=[[Université Laval]] |date=2008-09-30 |accessdate=2009-01-16|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The division of the country into language areas had serious consequences for education, and the [[Francization of Brussels#Role of education|"freedom of the head of household"]] was abolished. Thence, Dutch-speaking children were required to be educated in Dutch and French-speaking children in French.&lt;ref name="onderwijs"/&gt;  This managed to stem the tide of further Francization in Brussels. Some of the more radical French-speakers such as the [[Democratic Front of Francophones]] were opposed to this change and advocated the restoration of the freedom of education.&lt;ref name="onderwijs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fdf"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fdf.be/spip.php?article20 |title=L'historique du FDF |author=Paul Debongnie |date=1981-04-30 |publisher=[[Front démocratique des francophones]] (FDF) |accessdate=2009-01-17|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism from the FDF==
The [[Democratic Front of Francophones]] ({{lang-fr|Front démocratique des francophones}}, FDF) was founded in 1964 as a reaction to the fixation of the language border.  The FDF decried the limitation of Brussels to 19 municipalities.&lt;ref name="degroof"/&gt; They demanded free choice of language in the educational system, the freedom for the Brussels metropolitan area to grow beyond the language border and into the unilingual Flanders, and economic opportunities for the metropolitan area that would later comprise the Brussels-Capital Region. The Front accepted that governmental agencies in Brussels would be bilingual, but not that every civil servant working in those agencies be bilingual. The party experienced growing popularity and saw electoral success in the elections of the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref name="fdf"/&gt;

The FDF objected to a fixed representation of the language groups in the agencies, considering this to be undemocratic. In the predecessor to the [[Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region]], for example, a significant number of seats were reserved for Dutch-speakers. A number of French-speakers circumvented this by claiming to be Dutch-speakers, and over a third of the seats reserved for Dutch-speakers were taken by these so-called "false Flemish".&lt;ref name="deschouwer"&gt;{{cite book

With the fusion of Belgian municipalities in 1976, some primarily French-speaking municipalities joined larger municipalities with Flemish majorities,&lt;ref name="carrefour"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ulaval3"&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.tlfq.ulaval.ca/axl/Europe/belgiquefrn.htm La Communauté française de Belgique], Département de Langues, linguistique et traduction, Faculté des Lettres, Université Laval de Québec, Canada&lt;/ref&gt; thereby reducing the number of French-speaking municipalities.&lt;ref name="tribune"&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.tbx.be/fr/Dossier/8/app.rvb Les francophones de la périphérie], Baudouin Peeters, La Tribune de Bruxelles&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Zellik]] joined [[Asse]], [[Sint-Stevens-Woluwe]] and [[Sterrebeek]] joined [[Zaventem]], and [[Strombeek-Bever]] joined [[Grimbergen]].  In addition, several larger municipalities with heavily Flemish population were created, such as [[Sint-Pieters-Leeuw]], [[Dilbeek]], [[Beersel]] and [[Tervuren]].  The FDF saw this as a motive for the fusion of the municipalities, not a result of it.&lt;ref name="fdf"/&gt;

==Reassessment of Dutch==
Amidst tension throughout the country, the sociolinguistic neglect of Dutch began to fade. The recognition of Dutch as the sole language of Flanders, the expansion of a well-functioning Flemish educational system, the development of the Flemish economy, and the popularization of [[Dutch Language Union|Standard Dutch]] were responsible for its revitalization.&lt;ref name="brio2" /&gt; The [[Flemish Community]] saw that if it wanted Dutch to have a prominent place in Brussels, it would need to make investing in Dutch language education its primary concern.&lt;ref name="rudi2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BuG"/&gt;

===Integration of Dutch into the educational system===
In 1971, the FDF managed to secure the right for individuals to again be able to choose the language of their education, and the FDF expected that Francization would continue as before.&lt;ref name="schutter"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.briobrussel.be/assets/andere%20publicaties/brusselse_thema%27s_7.pdf |chapter=Taalpolitiek en multiculturalisme in het Brussels Nederlandstalig onderwijs |trans-chapter=Language policy and multiculturalism in Dutch-speaking education in Brussels |author=Helder De Schutter |editor=Ann Mares |editor2=Els Witte |year=2001 |title=19 keer Brussel; Brusselse Thema's 7 |trans-title=19 times Brussels: Brussels Themes 7 |pages=375–421 |publisher=VUBPress |isbn=90-5487-292-6 |format=pdf |language=nl, fr, en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the effect was a reduction in the number of students enrolled in Flemish schools, falling from 6000 students in [[elementary school]] and 16,000 in [[high school]] in 1966-1967 to 5000 and 12,000 nine years later. But by that point, the Flemish Centre of Education&lt;!--  ({{lang-nl|Vlaams Onderwijscentrum}}, or VOC) --&gt;, created in 1967, had begun its campaign to promote education in Dutch, with its initial target being Dutch-speaking families. In 1976, this task was taken up by the precursor to today's [[Flemish Community Commission]] (VGC),&lt;ref name="velaers"&gt;{{cite book

|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; which made substantial investments to improve the quality of Dutch language schools. Starting in the 1978-1979 school year, the strategy began to bear fruit, and the number of children enrolled in Flemish daycares began to increase. This translated to an increase in the enrollment in primary schools a few years later.&lt;ref name="onderwijs"/&gt; As a result, all young Dutch-speaking children born after the mid-1970s have only gone to Flemish schools.&lt;ref name="janssens"/&gt; The Francization of Dutch-speakers became more and more rare with time. Nonetheless, foreign immigration continued to tilt the balance in favor of French.&lt;ref name="liberation"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liberation.fr/tribune/0101114915-bruxelles-un-enjeu-pour-la-francophonie |title=Bruxelles, un enjeu pour la francophonie |author=Jean-Paul Nassaux |date=2007-11-09 |publisher=[[Libération]] |accessdate=2009-01-16|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, the VGC started to concentrate its efforts on bilingual families, though the improvement of the Flemish schools had an unexpected effect; monolingual French-speaking families also began to send their children to Flemish schools.&lt;ref name="treffers"/&gt; This effect increased bit by bit, as bilingualism began to be thought of as normal.&lt;ref name="meer"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diver-city.be/2008/03/bruxelles-plus-que-bilingue-une.html |title=Bruxelles, plus que bilingue !

===Socioeconomic development of Flanders===
Wallonia's economic decline and the use of French by recent immigrants did little to help the prestige of French relative to Dutch.&lt;ref name="brbr"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dutch.ac.uk/studypacks/dutch_language/brussels/wereldcentrum.html |title=Wereldcentrum in het hart van Europa |year=2006 |work=Bruisend Brussel |editor=[[University College London]] |accessdate=Jan 16, 2009 |language=nl |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090723233947/http://www.dutch.ac.uk/studypacks/dutch_language/brussels/wereldcentrum.html |archivedate=2009-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[World War II]], the Flemish economy underwent significant growth. Flanders developed a prosperous middle class, and the prestige of Dutch saw an increase.&lt;ref name="meynen"/&gt;

Those born into a monolingual Dutch family in Brussels had always had a lower level of education than the average for Brussels. By contrast, 30% of the Flemings who had moved to Brussels from elsewhere had a university degree or other [[post-secondary education]], and were highly qualified. For example, since 1970 in Belgium as a whole, there have been more students enrolled in Dutch language universities than French ones. To be called a Dutch-speaker no longer evokes images of lower-class laborers, as it long had.&lt;ref name="janssens"/&gt; Bilingualism is increasingly a prerequisite for well-paying jobs,&lt;ref name="ned"/&gt; and what prestige the Dutch language currently has in Brussels is chiefly for economic reasons. It should be noted that the economic importance of Dutch in Brussels has little to do with the proportion of Brussels that is Dutch-speaking. Rather, it is primarily relations between businesses in Brussels and Flemish businesses, or more generally, with Dutch-speaking businesses as a whole that ensure the economic importance of Dutch in Brussels.&lt;ref name="rudi2"/&gt;

 --&gt;

==Foreign immigration==
{{See also|Brussels and the European Union|}}
In 1958, Brussels became the seat of the [[European Economic Community]], which later became the [[European Union|EU]], while the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] was established in 1967 with its headquarters in [[Evere]]. This, combined with economic immigration from [[southern Europe]] and later from [[Turkey]], [[Morocco]] (a former [[Treaty of Fez|French colony]]), and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]] (a former [[Belgian Congo|Belgian colony]]), changed the makeup of the population of Brussels. Between 1961 and 2006, the number of non-Belgian inhabitants grew from 7% to 56%.&lt;ref name="BuG"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.npdata.be/BuG/54/BuG-54.htm |title=Laatste 45 jaar in Brussel: 50% bevolking van autochtoon naar allochtoon |author=Jan Hertogen |date=2007-04-04 |work=Bericht uit het Gewisse |publisher=Non-Profit Data |accessdate=2009-01-17|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="imagine"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indymedia.be/nl/node/24835 |title=Bruxelles n’est pas le problème, c’est la solution |author=Eric Corijn |date=2007-11-12 |publisher=[[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]] (VUB) |accessdate=2009-01-17|language=fr}} Toegankelijk via [[Indymedia]].&lt;/ref&gt;  The newcomers adopted and spoke French in great numbers, mainly due to the [[French-speaking Africa]]n origins of many that came, with many Moroccans and Congolese already possessing proficiency in French at the time of their arrival.&lt;ref name="liberation"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vox"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.voxlatina.com/vox_dsp2.php3?art=1757 |title=La si longue histoire du conflit linguistique à Bruxelles |author=Marc Philippe, representing [[Rassemblement Wallonie France|RWF-RBF]] |date=2003-10-23 |publisher=Vox Latina |accessdate=2009-01-17 |language=fr |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011200403/http://www.voxlatina.com/vox_dsp2.php3?art=1757 |archivedate=2008-10-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, foreign immigration further reduced the percentage of Dutch-speakers and led to further Francization of the city. This stood in contrast to the first half of the 20th century, however, when the change was Francization of Brussels's existing Flemish inhabitants.

===Francization of immigrants and expatriates===
Out of all immigrant groups, [[Morocco|Moroccan]] immigrants used French the most, which gained increasing importance alongside [[Berber languages|Berber]] and [[Moroccan Arabic]] in their already bilingual community. The Turks held on to [[Turkish language|their own language]], although French also gained importance in their community. Dutch struggled to take hold in these two migrant groups.  Children from these communities attended (and often continue to attend) French-language education, and used French in their circles of friends and at home.&lt;ref name="rudi2"/&gt; This evolution is also seen with Portuguese, Spanish, and Italian migrants, who easily adopted French due to its similarity to other [[Romance languages]] that many already spoke.&lt;ref name="rudi2"/&gt; The northern Europeans, who are not nearly as numerous, came mainly after the 1980s, make more use of their own languages, such as [[English language|English]] and [[German language|German]]. When these northern Europeans happened to marry French-speakers, the language spoken at home often became French. In these groups, the long-term effects and trends of language shift are difficult to determine.&lt;ref name="rudi2"/&gt;

Brussels' multicultural and multiethnic character has widened the language situation beyond merely considering Dutch and French.  Dutch is patently less well represented than French in the monolingual population.  Out of 74 selected Dutch-speakers, only two were found to be monolingual, approximately nine times fewer than in the French-speaking population.&lt;ref name="BuG"/&gt;  Out of the inhabitants of Brussels-Capital region with foreign nationality, in 2000 3% spoke exclusively Dutch at home, compared to 9% who spoke exclusively French. In addition, 16% spoke another language in addition to French at home.&lt;ref name="janssens"/&gt;

[[Japanese community of Brussels|Japanese people residing in Brussels]] generally encounter the French and English languages at work. All of the schooling options for Japanese national children provide French education, and Marie Conte-Helm, author of ''[[The Japanese and Europe: Economic and Cultural Encounters]]'', wrote that "French language education thus becomes, to a greater or a lesser degree, a normal part" of the everyday lives in Japanese expatriates.&lt;ref name=ConteHelm105&gt;Conte-Helm, Marie.

[https://books.google.com/books?id=DKwVAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA105 105].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internationalization and rise of English===
As the [[European Union]] grew, and more foreign diplomats and other international personnel transferred to Brussels, the French-speakers worried that English would become the new lingua franca of the city.&lt;ref name="mons"&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.biennale-lf.org/actes2005/robert_massart.html Quelle place pour le français à Bruxelles?], Robert Massart&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lingua"&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.uclouvain.be/cps/ucl/doc/etes/documents/rep.kwaschin.html Lingua Franca], Annick Dabeye&lt;/ref&gt; This [[anglicization]] differed from the previous Francization in that, giving current circumstances, it was not perceived as competing or replacing Dutch.&lt;ref name="rudi2"/&gt; Dutch, which served only as an official language spoken by some at home, was not expected to suffer from the rise in English usage.&lt;ref name="brbr"/&gt; By contrast, the French-speaking nature of Brussels was seen as a bulwark against the deteriorating position of French as used in the European Union.&lt;ref name="CEE"&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.lemonde.fr/cgi-bin/ACHATS/acheter.cgi?offre=ARCHIVES&amp;type_item=ART_ARCH_30J&amp;objet_id=840181&amp;clef=ARC-TRK-NC_01 Avec l'élargissement, l'usage du français recule dans les institutions européennes], [[Le Monde]], 26 February 2004 (gratis toegang via [http://www.imperatif-francais.org/bienvenu/articles/2004/les-institutions-europeennes.html Impératif français] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512173042/http://www.imperatif-francais.org/bienvenu/articles/2004/les-institutions-europeennes.html |date=2011-05-12 }})&lt;/ref&gt;  Now (in 2008) more Brussels inhabitants claim to speak fluent English than fluent Dutch, 35% to 28%, respectively.&lt;ref name="lesoir"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lesoir.be/regions/bruxelles/enquete-le-francais-maitrise-2008-01-08-570166.shtml |title=Welcome supplante Welkom à Bruxelles |author=Francis Dubois |date=2008-01-08 |publisher=[[Le Soir]] |accessdate=2009-01-16|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, both stood at 33%.  Thus, the knowledge of Dutch has declined, although knowledge of Dutch is in higher demand in the job market than knowledge of English.&lt;ref name="rudi3"/&gt; Dutch has not been repressed by the influx of English, as only 3% of the English-speakers in Brussels are native speakers.  [[Lingua franca#English|English as a worldwide lingua franca]] fulfills an increasingly important role in the economic and cultural sphere, and in this sense poses more of a threat to the position of French than Dutch.  Now, most of those who speak Dutch, even as a second language, are usually trilingual.&lt;ref name="brbr"/&gt;  Foreign immigration coincided with the flight of city dwellers to the suburbs around Brussels, leading to a permanent, growing French-speaking presence in the [[Brussels-Capital Region]] itself.&lt;ref name="volk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hetvolk.be/Article/Detail.aspx?ArticleID=3G1CM3TA |title=Verfransing gevolg van stadsvlucht |publisher=[[Het Volk (newspaper)|Het Volk]] |date=May 24, 2007 |accessdate=July 17, 2009 |language=nl |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724134853/http://www.hetvolk.be/Article/Detail.aspx?ArticleID=3G1CM3TA |archivedate=July 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conte-Helm wrote that in the business sectors and "to varying degrees, in daily life" the English language "serves [the Japanese] well" since it is understood and may be used in different parts of Belgium.&lt;ref name=ConteHelm105/&gt;

Initially, Flemish political parties demanded Flanders be given [[jurisdiction]] over cultural matters, concerned with the dominance of the French language in the federal government. Likewise, as [[Wallonia#Economy|Wallonia was in economic decline]], Francophone political parties were concerned with getting economic autonomy for the French-speaking regions to address the situation. The Flemings also feared being in the minority, faced with two other French-speaking regions. They viewed the creation of a separate Brussels region as definitively cutting Brussels off from Flanders, an admission of the loss of Brussels to Francization.&lt;ref name="crisp"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rbc.irisnet.be/crisp/fr/b3.htm |title=La naissance de la Région de Bruxelles-Capitale |author=Crisp (Centre de recherche et d'information socio-politiques) |work=Présentation de la Région |publisher=[[Brussels-Capital Region]] |accessdate=January 17, 2009 |language=fr |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502152857/http://www.rbc.irisnet.be/crisp/fr/b3.htm |archivedate=May 2, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, the Flemings had a vision of Belgium with two parts: a Dutch-speaking part and a French-speaking part, whereas Francophones had a vision with three parts: Flanders, Brussels and Wallonia.

In 1989, the compromise between these conceptions gave rise to the official creation of the [[Brussels-Capital Region]],&lt;ref name="deschouwer"/&gt; and influenced the jurisdictions it was given. It was given its own government, including [[Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region|its own parliament]], with 11 seats of the 75 total reserved for Dutch-speakers.&lt;!-- It seems that at first, there were only 75 total. -OP --&gt; This was increased in 2004 to 17 of 89 seats, roughly a fifth of the total.&lt;ref name="delgrange"&gt;{{cite book

The [[List of Ministers-President of the Brussels Capital-Region|Minister-President]] is in practice always a francophone, so the [[cabinet (government)|cabinet]] of the Region has 5 French-speaking and 3 Dutch-speaking members.

The region was placed on equal footing with the [[Flemish Region]] and the [[Walloon Region]]. Nonetheless, Brussels does not have its own community; rather the [[Flemish Community]] and the [[French Community]] both have jurisdiction in Brussels. The [[Flemish Community Commission]] (VGC) and the [[French Community Commission]] (COCOF) were to act on their respective Communities' behalf in Brussels.&lt;ref name="dumont"&gt;{{cite book

===Periphery of Brussels===
In [[Drogenbos]], [[Kraainem]], [[Linkebeek]], [[Sint-Genesius-Rode]], [[Wemmel]] and [[Wezembeek-Oppem]], the six [[Municipalities with language facilities]] in the suburbs around Brussels, the proportion of the population that was French-speaking also grew in the second half of the 20th century, and they now constitute a majority.&lt;ref name="depré"/&gt; In the [[Arrondissements of Belgium#Administrative|administrative arrondissement]] of [[Halle-Vilvoorde]], which constitutes those six municipalities and 29 other Flemish municipalities, around 25% of families speak French at home.&lt;ref name="kindengezin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vlaanderen.be/servlet/Satellite?c=MIN_Publicatie&amp;cid=1174962675596&amp;p=1142511947281&amp;pagename=minister_frank_vandenbroucke%2FMIN_Publicatie%2FPublicatie_met_relatiesMIN&amp;subtype=Nota |title=Sociaal-economisch profiel van de Vlaamse Rand en een blik op het Vlaamse karakter |date=March 23, 2007 |publisher=Government of the [[Flemish Community]] |accessdate=July 16, 2009 |format=doc |language=nl }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Flemish government sees this as a worrying trend, and enacted policies designed to keep the periphery of Brussels Dutch-speaking.&lt;ref name="depré"/&gt;&lt;ref name="beleid"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jsp.vlaamsparlement.be/docs/stukken/1995-1996/g402-6.pdf |title=Decreet houdende oprichting van de v.z.w.

This ''[[circulaire]]'' stipulates, among other things, that when French-speakers in those six Municipalities with language facilities deal with the government, they can request a French version of documents or publications but need to do so every time they want one; the government is not allowed to register their preference.&lt;ref name="depré"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://binnenland.vlaanderen.be/regelgeving/omzendbrieven/omz16.12.1997.htm |title=Betreft: Omzendbrief BA 97/22 van 16 december 1997 betreffende het taalgebruik in gemeentebesturen van het Nederlandse taalgebied (Peeters directive) |date=December 16, 1997 |publisher=Government of the [[Flemish Community]]|accessdate=January 17, 2009 |language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Brussels's northwestern municipalities, the proportion of Dutch-speakers is high compared to other municipalities in Brussels. It is in these same municipalities that the proportion of non-native Dutch-speakers who speak Dutch is highest, generally in excess of 20%. At the two extremes are [[Ganshoren]], where 25% of non-native speakers speak Dutch, and [[Saint-Gilles, Belgium|Saint-Gilles]], where Dutch as a language spoken at home has practically disappeared.&lt;ref name="janssens"/&gt;&lt;!-- Check translation please --&gt;

The younger a generation is, the poorer its knowledge of Dutch tends to be. The demographic of those who grew up speaking only Dutch at home, and to a lesser extent those who grew up bilingual, is significantly older than the Brussels average. Between 2000 and 2006, the proportion of monolingual Dutch families shrank from 9.5% to 7.0%, whereas bilingual families shrank from 9.9% to 8.6%.&lt;ref name="rudi3"/&gt; On the other hand, in the same period the number of non-native Dutch-speakers with a good-to-excellent knowledge of Dutch saw an increase.&lt;ref name="janssens"/&gt; Half of those in Brussels with a good knowledge of Dutch learned the language outside of their family, and this figure is expected to increase.&lt;ref name="rudi3"/&gt; In 2001, 70% of the city had a knowledge of Dutch that was "at least passable".&lt;ref name="janssens"/&gt;{{rp|51}} In 2006, 28% of those living in Brussels had a good to excellent knowledge of Dutch, while 96% had a good to excellent knowledge of French, and 35% of English. French was found to be spoken at home in 77% of households in Brussels, Dutch in 16% of households, and neither official language was spoken in 16% of households. French is thus by far the best known language in Brussels, and remains the [[lingua franca]] of the city.&lt;ref name="rudi3"/&gt;

Of businesses based in Brussels, 50% use French for internal business, while 32% use French and Dutch, the others using a variety of other languages.&lt;ref name="rudi2"/&gt;{{rp|152}} More than a third of job openings require bilingualism, and a fifth of job openings require knowledge of English.&lt;ref name="rudi2"/&gt;{{rp|149}} On account of this, it is argued that an increase in knowledge of Dutch in Brussels and Wallonia would significantly improve the prospects of job seekers in those regions.&lt;ref name="cifop"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cifop.be/doc/ceblf/Reforme_des_Institutions_Belges_260108-030208.pdf |title=Pour une réforme des institutions belges qui combine flexibilité et coordination |date=January 26, 2008 |publisher=Centre Interuniversitaire de Formation Permanente (C.I.Fo.P.) |accessdate=January 27, 2009 |format=pdf |language=fr |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706133238/http://www.cifop.be/doc/ceblf/Reforme_des_Institutions_Belges_260108-030208.pdf |archivedate=July 6, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of advertising campaigns in Brussels, 42% are bilingual French and Dutch, while 33% are in French only, 10% in French and English and 7% in English, French and Dutch.&lt;ref name="rudi2"/&gt;{{rp|41}} During the day, the percentage of Dutch-speakers in Brussels increases significantly, with 230,000 [[commuting|commuters]] coming from the Flemish Region, significantly more than the 130,000 coming from the Walloon Region.

===National political concerns===
&lt;!-- I've skipped translating the first of the three paragraphs in FR for now. I'm not sure we should include it to keep the length of the article to be something reasonable -OP --&gt;
Francophones living in Flanders want Flanders to ratify the [[Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities]], which has been signed by almost every country in Europe, though in Belgium, it has been signed but not ratified (also the case in a handful of others). The Framework would allow Francophones to claim the right to use their own language when dealing with the authorities, bilingual street names, schooling in French, etc. The Framework, however, does not specify what a "National Minority" is,&lt;ref name="delgrange"/&gt; and the Flemings do not see the Francophones in Flanders as being one.&lt;ref name="clement"/&gt; Flanders is not inclined to approve the Framework, in spite of frequent appeals by the [[Council of Europe]] to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.secessie.nu/pdf/5-1.pdf |title=Vlaanderen versus de Raad van Europa |author=Theo L.R. Lansloot |year=2001 |work=Secessie |publisher=Mia Brans Instituut |accessdate=January 17, 2009 |format=pdf |language=nl |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511182137/http://www.secessie.nu/pdf/5-1.pdf |archivedate=May 11, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Flemish circles, there is an ever continuing worry that the status of Dutch in Brussels will continue to deteriorate, and that the surrounding region will undergo even more Francization. On the political level, the division of the bilingual [[Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde]] (BHV) electoral and judicial district caused much linguistic strife. The district is composed of the 19 municipalities of the Brussels-Capital Region in addition to the 35 municipalities of the Flemish [[Arrondissements of Belgium#Administrative|administrative arrondissement]] of [[Halle-Vilvoorde]].&lt;ref name="BHV"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.standaard.be/Artikel/detail.aspx?artikelId=GHI5DSBV |title=Wat u moet weten over Brussel-Halle-Vilvoorde |author=Steven Samyn |publisher=[[De Standaard]] |date=April 20, 2004 |accessdate=January 17, 2009 |language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; For elections to the [[Belgian Senate]] and to the [[European Parliament]], which are organized by linguistic region, residents from anywhere in the arrondissement can vote for French-speaking parties in Wallonia and Brussels. For elections to the [[Belgian Chamber of Representatives]], which is usually done by [[provinces of Belgium|province]], voters from Halle-Vilvoorde can vote for parties in Brussels, and vice versa. It was feared that, if BHV was divided, the francophones living in Halle-Vilvoorde would no longer be able to vote for candidates in Brussels, and they would lose the right to judicial proceedings in French.&lt;!-- Check this last sentence please --&gt;&lt;ref name="truc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lalibre.be/index.php?view=article&amp;art_id=368438 |title=BHV : c'est quoi ce truc ? |author=M.Bu.  |publisher=[[La Libre Belgique]] |date=September 6, 2007 |accessdate=February 28, 2009 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a division were to take place, francophone political parties would demand that the Brussels-Capital Region be expanded, a proposal that is unacceptable to Flemish parties. This issue was one of the chief reasons for the [[2007–2008 Belgian government formation|200-day impasse in Belgian government formation in 2007]], and it remained a hotly contested issue between the linguistic Communities, until this issue was resolved mid-2012.&lt;ref name="veron"/&gt;

"'''Good Times with Weapons'''" is episode 112 of ''[[South Park]]''.  The first episode of [[South Park (season 8)|season 8]], it originally aired on March 17, 2004. The episode's [[animation]] routinely switches from the usual [[cutout animation|cutout]]-and-solid-color style to a highly stylized [[anime]] theme. [[Music of Asia|Asian]]-style [[ambient music|ambience]] plays in the background.

In the episode, the boys are transformed into Japanese warriors after they buy martial arts weapons at a local market. Their sworn enemy, Professor Chaos, confronts them and a highly stylized battle ensues.

This was also one of ten episodes to be featured on ''South Park: The Hits'' DVD.  In addition, it was voted the 2nd best episode of all time by fans in the [[United States]],{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} while being ranked the third best among fans in the [[United Kingdom]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} This episode was one of the first to be available in [[high-definition television|high definition]], available on the [[Xbox 360]]'s [[Xbox Live Marketplace|Marketplace]]. A promotional [[HD DVD]] was also released exclusively for [[Best Buy]].

This was the first episode with [[April Stewart]] as the bulk of the female characters following [[Eliza Schneider]]'s departure.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|705928|Good Times with Weapons}}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode was written by series co-creator [[Trey Parker]]. In 2015, he and co-creator [[Matt Stone]] listed it as their second favorite episode of the series.&lt;ref name="ew"&gt;{{cite news|title='South Park': Matt Stone and Trey Parker Name Their 15 Best Episodes (and 53 Worst)|url=https://ew.com/gallery/south-park-matt-stone-and-trey-parker-name-their-15-best-episodes-and-53-worst/|date=November 3, 2015|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=March 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
At the [[Park County, Colorado|Park County]] Fair, the boys come across a vendor selling "authentic weapons from the [[Far East]]" and are interested in purchasing them. Although the vendor says parental permission is required if the hopeful buyer is under 18 years old, [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] uses this information to pretend that he, [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]], [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] and [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] are orphaned brothers (a ruse the boys have apparently successfully used "like twelve times" in the past) and successfully tricks the vendor into giving them the weapons. Stan purchases a pair of [[Tonfa]], Kyle gets [[nunchaku]], Cartman buys a pair of [[sai (weapon)|sai]], and Kenny purchases (according to Cartman) the only thing he can afford, a pair of [[shuriken|''shaken''-style shuriken]]. After showing their weapons off to [[Craig (South Park)|Craig]], they go around town pretending to be ninjas, becoming [[anime]]-like characters with their own individual [[Superpower (ability)|superpower]]s. The animation style takes on an overall Japanese look and switches to a [[Anamorphic format|cinemascope]] aspect ratio whenever this happens. 

Butters sees them playing and wants to join but the boys refuse to let him. He goes home and becomes his [[supervillain]] [[alter ego]], [[Butters Stotch#Professor Chaos|Professor Chaos]], and sets off to get his revenge on the four ninjas. Not realizing who he actually is, the boys agree to engage in battle with their new enemy. Professor Chaos gains the upper hand by neutralizing Kyle and Stan and Cartman proves no help as he prefers to use his ninja power to embarrass Kyle. Kenny comes to their defense and throws one of his shuriken.

The shuriken hits Butters in his eye and becomes lodged in it, which immediately brings an end to the battle and brings the boys back to their senses. Suddenly they all realize that Butters needs medical attention, but taking him to the local hospital would result in their parents finding out about their purchases. They try to pull the shuriken out of Butters' eye themselves but when that only makes things worse, Stan and Cartman decide that the only way they can take Butters to a doctor is if they go to the local veterinarian and so, they dress Butters up like a dog. 

[[File:SP Good Times With Weapons.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Butters after being dressed up as a dog]]
On the way, the boys encounter Craig again and have to hide Butters in an abandoned oven so nobody sees him. Much to their chagrin, Craig has copied them and obtained weapons from the same vendor, enlisting [[Jimmy (South Park)|Jimmy]], [[Clyde (South Park)|Clyde]], and [[Token Black|Token]] as his fellow ninjas. The two ninja groups fight, but in the chaos Butters escapes. The four boys force Craig's group to help them search for Butters, threatening to tell on them if they do not.

A weakened Butters makes his way to the hospital but his disguise fools the attending doctor, who sends Butters to the local animal shelter. There, the veterinarian determines that the only thing to do is to [[animal euthanasia|put Butters to sleep]]. Just before he does, Butters escapes again and heads for the fair. So he decides to put another dog to sleep.

The boys decide to dispose of the evidence and return to the fair to have the vendor refund their money, which he refuses to do. Craig and the others inform them that they have seen Butters wandering around on the other side of the fair towards an auction that all their parents are attending. Cartman decides to use his ninja power of [[invisibility]] to walk across the auction stage to get to Butters undetected and takes off his clothes. However, since nobody else knows what the boys have been up to, Cartman inadvertently ends up [[streaking]] across the stage and is unable to reach Butters, who collapses on the stage while everyone looks on stunned.

The final scene shows the townsfolk protesting at an emergency meeting about the [[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy|outrage at the auction]]. The boys are under the impression that the outrage in question is Butters' wound (which has been medically treated by this time), but it soon transpires that the real issue is Cartman's [[public nudity]]. Cartman explains that it was a "[[wardrobe malfunction]]", and the episode ends with the other three boys addressing the issue that adults are more offended by sex than by violence, allowing them to keep their weapons. The episode ends with a freeze-frame of the boys in Anime style posing and embarking on another adventure as they have more work to do.

==Production==
In spite of the episode's popularity among fans, series co-creators [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] openly admitted in the season eight DVD audio commentary that they did not think it was a very good episode. This episode features "Let's Fighting Love", a [[theme music|theme song]] that mixes [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[English language|English]] [[lyrics]] in a [[Pastiche|style parody]] of ''[[anime]]'' theme songs including that of ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]''. The song is performed by series creator Trey Parker.&lt;ref name="GTW1"&gt;Audio Commentary on "Good Times with Weapons" with Trey Parker and Matt Stone, "South Park: The Hits, Vol. 1", Comedy Central Home Entertainment, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[transitive verb]] '''to Hawaiianize''' means to take a physical product, word, or concept hitherto unrelated to [[Hawaiian culture]], and confer a Hawaiian form, quality, and character upon it through various means. The word is an increasingly popular [[neologism]], in the manner of [[Anglicise]], [[Africanization|Africanise]], and [[Americanize]], and is most commonly used in matters of [[etymology]] and nomenclature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.babynamesocean.com/origin/hawaiian_baby_names_15.html "Hawaiian Baby Names]," ''Baby Names Ocean''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norman, Teresa “A World of Baby Names,” See entry: Keli ''Published 2003, Perigee''&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, it is used both to mean the transliteration of English into Hawaiian and also the general 'Hawaiianization' of anything. '''Hawaiianize''' &lt;ref&gt;[http://aloha.kapotrading.com "Hawaiianize]," ''KTC Hawaiian''&lt;/ref&gt; also means to incorporate the Hawaiian culture, spirit and character to anything and to live the Aloha Spirit through life, love and laughter. It is also used to indicate the adding of Hawaiian instrumentation and/or language to a non-Hawaiian song; the adding of Hawaiian themes such as [[palm trees]], tropical flowers, [[rainbows]], [[dolphins]], [[whales]], [[sea turtles]], volcanic lava flows, etc. to textiles and artifacts: the adding of [[papaya]], [[mango]] and/or [[guava]] flavors to drinks and edibles; the adding of Hawaiian tropical flower fragrances such as [[ginger]], [[plumeria]], [[gardenia]] and [[tuberose]] to lotions and beauty products; the use of Hawaiian ideas in gardening.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fukubonsai.com/2b1.html "True indoor Bonsai]," ''Fuku Bonsai''&lt;/ref&gt; The word has started entering forms of popular culture&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whatsoniphone.com/reviews/hawaiianize "Hawaiianize]," ''What's On iPhone''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pamelapolland.com/ "Hawaiianized]," ''Get Hawaiianized''&lt;/ref&gt; and is frequently used as an adjective in its [[gerundive]] form, "Hawaiianized".

[[Image:Temple of Saint Sava - Monument.jpg|200 px|thumb|right|The Temple of [[Saint Sava]] (1175 - 1235), first Serbian legislator]]

The roots of [[law]], legal thought and education in [[Serbia]] go back to the 13th century. This is owed to [[Rastko Nemanjić]], who was declared a saint under the name [[St. Sava]]. Rastko, the brother of the first Serbian king [[Stefan Nemanjić]], was the founder of not only the ecclesiastical independence ([[autocephaly]] of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian church]] in 1219), but he also has instituted the Serbian education, literature, health, the legal system and science.

At the same time when [[John of England]] released the famous [[Magna Carta Libertatum]] in [[Latin]], in Serbia [[St. Sava]] has prepared and published in his native language a collection of both church and secular regulations under the name [[Nomocanon]] ({{lang-sr|Zakonopravilo}}). In conjunction with the monumental lawmaking initiative of [[Stefan Uroš IV Dušan of Serbia]] in 1349, the [[Dusan's Code|Dušan's Code]], which was written in Serbian as well, these acts constitute the foundation of the Serbian legal culture. Even during the long-lasting rule of the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]], which began in the mid-15th century, Serbian law has survived through the practice of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]], which still considers the Nomocanon its official codex. However, only liberation from the Turkish authorities, starting in the 19th century, enabled the full bloom of Serbian legal science and education.

At some stage in the struggle for national liberation from the Turks during the [[First Serbian Uprising]] that started in 1804, the [[Belgrade Higher School]] was founded in 1808. The classes lasted three years and in addition to general subjects the curriculum included comparative and [[constitutional law|state (constitutional) law]], [[international law]], [[criminal law]] and judicial procedure. Therefore, there are many historians who believe that it is justified to perceive that the foundation of modern education in Serbia was the Higher School and the year 1808. This year is taken as the date when the [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Law]] was established.

==1841 – 1863==

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Konakknjljubice.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Countess Ljubica's Residence|Residence of Countess Ljubica]], home to the [[Belgrade Higher School|Higher School]] between 1841 – 1863]] --&gt;

In 1841, Belgrade has become the capital city of Serbia and in the same year the [[Lyceum]] moved from [[Kragujevac]] to [[Belgrade]]. At that time, the [[Belgrade Lyceum]] had two departments - [[Law]] and [[Philosophy]]. Before enrolling the Legal Department (which initially lasted one year, from 1843 two years, and since 1849 three years), it was compulsory to graduate at the Philosophy Department, where the studies lasted two years, so the legal studies lasted a total of five years. The classes were in the native Serbian language, and the first professors were learned Serbs from [[Vojvodina]]. Among them was the well-known Serbian writer, comediographer and lawyer, [[Jovan Sterija Popović]], who held two courses: [[Natural Law]] (Encyclopedia of Law, or today's Introduction to Law) and a course on the organization of courts and civil procedure. Since 1853, the [[legal education]] became independent from the studies of philosophy.

==1863 – 1905==

[[Image:Belgrade University Buildings.jpg|thumb|right|The Mansion of [[Captain Miša’s Mansion|Captain Miša Anastasijević]], home to the [[Belgrade Higher School|Higher School]] between 1863 – 1905]]

Subsequently, in 1863 the [[University of Belgrade]] rudiment consisted of the Philosophy, Law and Technical departments. From the [[Countess Ljubica's Residence]], a beautiful small building in the center of Belgrade, the Higher School moved to one of the most significant buildings in Belgrade, the [[Captain Miša’s Mansion]], bequeathed to the nation by Captain [[Miša Anastasijević]], which is today home to the [[Rector (academia)|Rector]]ate (seat) of the [[University of Belgrade]]. Since then, [[legal education]] in [[Serbia]] lasted four years, within the framework of which 21 subjects were compulsory.

==1905 – 1941==

The Higher School formally became the [[University of Belgrade]] through the Law on the University from February 27, 1905. In addition to the Philosophy, Law and Technical schools, this Law has set forth the existence of [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[Theology]] and Medical schools. Given the limited space in the building of Captain Miša Anastasijević, the library of the Faculty of Law has moved to a separate building in the center of the city, and a number of its teachers received their offices at the National Library at the [[Kosančićev Venac]]. Today, the law school building, whose construction began in 1937, was completed in fall 1940, just before the [[Second World War]]. The Library of the Faculty of Law has been moved there as well. At that time, it had a collection of over 36,000 books and monographs, representing the foremost [[law library]] in the [[Balkans]]. 

The legal studies lasted four years and consisted of the 19 compulsory subjects, and for students of the [[Islamic]] confession [[Sharia Law]] was introduced as an additional subject. Regulations on law schools from 1938 have set forth a unique curriculum for all three law schools, which then existed in the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] ([[Belgrade]], [[Zagreb]], [[Ljubljana]]). Twenty compulsory subjects were set forth, with the proviso that only at the [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Law]], under the same conditions as before, [[Sharia Law]] was taught as an additional subject.

Since the formation of the University until the [[First World War]] several hundred students were enrolled. The first woman at the [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Law]] graduated in 1914. During the period between the two world wars, the law school experienced its full bloom, it grew out into a modern European institution for legal education and has acquired a high international reputation. Shortly before the [[Second World War]], more than 4,000 students were enrolled (of which there were almost 1,000 female students).

At that time, [[Slobodan Jovanović]] was one of the greatest authorities on [[jurisprudence]] and especially [[constitutional law]]. Liberal in his social and political views, he was for nearly half a century a leader of the Serbian intelligentsia.

==1941 – 1945==

[[Image:Belgradelawschool.jpg|thumb|right|The building of the [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Law]] was constructed by famous Serbian architect Petar Bajalović in 1941]]

The newly constructed law school building was damaged during the [[Bombing of Belgrade in World War II|April bombing of Belgrade]] in 1941 and all lectures and activities were suspended. The German occupation forces moved into the building. Although there were later attempts of the occupation authorities to do the restoration work, this has not occurred due to the protests and boycott of the professors and aides. In November 1941, seven teachers were imprisoned in a camp, because of their liberal attitudes and antifascist views, and two foremost Serbian authorities in legal education, Djordje Tasić and Mihajlo Ilic, were executed in 1944.

==1945 to present==

The building was renewed shortly after the [[Second World War]], but the dramatic changes engendered by the Communist rule and the decades of legal, social and political experiments have left various consequences. Immediately after the war, and later due to the ideological and political dissent, the Faculty of Law lost a number of its professors and assistants. Notably, after the well-known discourse on the constitutional amendments of 1971, the state proceeded with the criminal prosecution and imprisonment of renowned Professor [[Mihailo Djurić]]. It was a similar case with many other academics.

Despite the flagrant events from the following decades, the law school rapidly developed. An entire constellation of scholars of the new generation emerged, who continued the work of their distinguished predecessors. [[Alexander Soloviev (historian)|Alexander Soloviev]], [[Radomir Lukić]] and [[Mihailo Djurić]] are some of the foremost Serbian legal academics of the 20th century. Their students until today are at the forefront of the teams of experts drafting new laws, their scholarly papers are being published abroad, they are the arbitrators at international arbitration courts, members of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts, members and officials of international scholarly institutions and professional organizations, honorary doctors at foreign universities, visiting professors at the world’s leading universities, and rectors of the University of Belgrade. 

During the 20th century, all the law schools that later emerged in Serbia ([[Subotica]], [[Novi Sad]], [[Priština]], [[Niš]], [[Kragujevac]]), [[Montenegro]] ([[Podgorica]]), and in other parts of the [[former Yugoslavia]] ([[Sarajevo]], [[Skoplje]]) were formed from the [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Law]] as a core. A large number of law professors from all the countries of the former Yugoslavia had obtained their academic titles in Belgrade.

== Origins ==
The exact date of the invention of Hungary water is lost to history, though some sources say it dates to 1370&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Mystery and Lure of Perfume|last=Thompson|first=C.J.S.|publisher=John Lane the Bodley Head Limited|year=1927|isbn=|location=London|pages=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the late 14th century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is equally unclear who in particular created it. According to legend, it was formulated at the command of the Queen Elizabeth of Hungary,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Voudouri|first=Dimitra|last2=Tesseromatis|first2=Christine|date=December 2015|title=Perfumery from Myth to Antiquity|url=http://ijmpnet.com/journals/ijmp/Vol_3_No_2_Decembe_2015/4.pdf|journal=International Journal of Medicine and Pharmacy|volume=3|issue=2|pages=52|doi=10.15640/ijmp.v3n2a4|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes identified as Queen Isabella of Hungary{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Historically, the name Isabella was a variant of Elisabeth, and in the period in question the two were sometimes interchangeable.&lt;/ref&gt; or in one document{{Specify}} "Saint Elisabeth, Queen of Hungary".&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This may be a conflation of multiple individuals.&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources say that a hermit or monk-recluse first gave it to the Queen of Hungary,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; though most likely it was made by a court alchemist or a monk-alchemist.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} These legends mostly date to the early to mid-17th century,{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} so the details may have become confused in the intervening centuries.

=== Namesake ===
The queen in question is frequently assumed{{By whom|date=May 2018}} to be [[Elisabeth of Poland]] (1305–1380), although the particulars of her life do not match those in the more common legends. It is even more unlikely that it could be Saint [[Elisabeth of Hungary]] (1207–1231), who is additionally too early and not a queen.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The technique of [[distillation]] only became well known in Europe between about 1150 and 1250.&lt;/ref&gt; The only plausible Queen Isabella (late 13th century){{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} likewise seems to be too early to be a strong candidate, as the invention of this water is most probably related{{Why|date=May 2018}} to the [[Black Death]] epidemic that ravaged Europe between 1346 and 1350.

== Spread through Europe ==
According to legends, Hungary water first appeared outside of [[Hungary]] in 1370 when [[Charles V of France]], who was famous for his love of fragrances, received some.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} Its use was popular across Europe for many centuries, and until ''[[Eau de Cologne]]'' appeared in the 18th century, it was the most popular fragrance and remedy applied.{{Cn|date=May 2018}} 

=== French Hungary water ===
By the 18th century, French Hungary water from [[Montpellier]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
|publisher = Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme &amp; Brown
|publication-date = 1819
|publication-place = London |title = [[Rees's Cyclopædia|The Cyclopaedia]] |author= Abraham Rees |chapter=Montpelier |chapterurl= https://archive.org/stream/cyclopaediaoruni24rees#page/n51/mode/1up
}}&lt;/ref&gt; was being touted over other variations of Hungary water, because of the quality of the rosemary used in the distillation.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Advertisements in newspapers even warned against counterfeit versions of French Hungary water, explaining to potential buyers how to detect the difference in quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1724-1725|title=The Weekly journal: or, Saturday's post.

== Usage ==
Similar to other herb and flower-based products, Hungary water was also a valuable remedy, with recipes advising the user to wash with it&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; or drink it in order to receive the most benefit.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It was even thought to help people maintain youthful appearance and beauty.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

An '''information society''' is a [[society]] where the creation, distribution, use, integration and manipulation of [[information]] is a significant economic, political, and cultural activity. Its main drivers are digital [[information and communication technologies]], which have resulted in an [[information explosion]] and are profoundly changing all aspects of social organization, including the [[economy]],&lt;ref&gt;Hilbert, M.

Mossberger as “Those who use the Internet regularly and effectively”. This is one of many dozen labels that have been identified to suggest that humans are entering a new phase of society.&lt;ref name="Beniger 1986"&gt;{{cite book |title= The Control Revolution: Technological and Economic Origins of the Information Society |last= Beniger |first=James R. |authorlink= James R. Beniger |date=1986 |location=Cambridge, Mass. |publisher=Harvard University Press|title-link= The Control Revolution }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The markers of this rapid change may be technological, economic, occupational, spatial, cultural, or some combination of all of these.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |last=Webster |first=Frank |title=Theories of the Information Society |date=2002 |publisher=Routledge |location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Information society is seen as the successor to [[industrial society]]. Closely related concepts are the [[post-industrial society]] ([[Daniel Bell]]), [[post-fordism]], [[postmodernity|post-modern]] society, knowledge society, telematic society, [[Information Revolution]], [[liquid modernity]], and [[network society]] ([[Manuel Castells]]).

==Definition==
There is currently no universally accepted concept of what exactly can be termed information society and what shall rather not so be termed. Most theoreticians agree that a transformation can be seen that started somewhere between the 1970s and today and is changing the way societies work fundamentally. Information technology goes beyond the [[internet]], and there are discussions about how big the influence of specific media or specific modes of production really is. Frank Webster notes five major types of information that can be used to define information society: technological, economic, occupational, spatial and cultural.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to Webster, the character of information has transformed the way that we live today. How we conduct ourselves centers around theoretical knowledge and information.&lt;ref&gt;Webster, F. (2006). Chapter 2: What is an information society? In ''Theories of the Information Society'', 3rd ed. (pp. 15-31). New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kasiwulaya and Gomo (Makerere University) allude{{Where|date=February 2018}}&lt;!-- Exactly where do they make this allusion (if allusions are even worth bothering with)? --&gt;{{Dubious|date=February 2018}}&lt;!-- If they don't dare say it but merely allude to it, why are we bothering with this? --&gt; that information societies are those that have intensified their use of IT for economic, social, cultural and political transformation. In 2005, governments reaffirmed their dedication to the foundations of the Information
Society in the [[Tunis Commitment]] and outlined the basis for implementation and follow-up in the Tunis Agenda for the Information Society. In particular, the Tunis Agenda addresses the issues of financing of ICTs for development and Internet governance that could not be resolved in the first phase.

Some people, such as [[Antonio Negri]], characterize the information society as one in which people do immaterial labour. By this, they appear to refer to the production of knowledge or cultural artifacts. One problem with this model is that it ignores the material and essentially industrial basis of the society. However it does point to a problem for workers, namely how many creative people does this society need to function?  For example, it may be that you only need a few star performers, rather than a plethora of non-celebrities, as the work of those performers can be easily distributed, forcing all secondary players to the bottom of the market. It ''is'' now common for publishers to promote only their best selling authors and to try to avoid the rest—even if they still sell steadily. Films are becoming more and more judged, in terms of distribution, by their first weekend's performance, in many cases cutting out opportunity for word-of-mouth development.

[[Michael Buckland]] characterizes information in society in his book ''Information and Society.'' Buckland expresses the idea that information can be interpreted differently from person to person based on that individual's experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buckland|first1=Michael|title=Information in Society|date=March 3, 2017|publisher=MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Considering that metaphors and technologies of information move forward in a reciprocal relationship, we can describe some societies (especially the [[Japanese society]]) as an information society because we think of it as such.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Boyle (academic)|James Boyle]], 1996, 6{{Vague|date=February 2018}}&lt;!-- WHAT, published by Boyle in 1996? --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Kasiwulaya and Walter, Makerere University. Makerere University Press.{{Vague|date=February 2018}}&lt;!-- WHAT is this? --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The word information may be interpreted in many different ways. According to Buckland in ''Information and Society'', most of the meanings fall into three categories of human knowledge: information as knowledge, information as a process, and information as a thing.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Information and Society|last=Buckland|first=Michael|publisher=MIT Press|year=2017|isbn=|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hilbert InfoGrowth.png|thumb|right|360px|The amount of data stored globally has increased greatly since the 1980s, and by 2007, 94% of it was stored digitally. [http://www.martinhilbert.net/WorldInfoCapacity.html Source]]]

The growth of technologically mediated information has been quantified in different ways, including society's technological capacity to store information, to communicate information, and to compute information. It is estimated that, the world's technological capacity to store information grew from 2.6 (optimally compressed) [[exabytes]] in 1986, which is the informational equivalent to less than one 730-MB [[CD-ROM]] per person in 1986 (539 MB per person), to 295 (optimally compressed) [[exabytes]] in 2007.&lt;ref name="HilbertLopez2011"&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/332/6025/60 "The World’s Technological Capacity to Store, Communicate, and Compute Information"], Martin Hilbert and Priscila López (2011), [[Science (journal)|Science]], 332(6025), 60-65; free access to the article through here: martinhilbert.net/WorldInfoCapacity.html&lt;/ref&gt; This is the informational equivalent of 60 [[CD-ROM]] per person in 2007&lt;ref name="Hilbertvideo2011"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIKPjOuwqHo "video animation on The World’s Technological Capacity to Store, Communicate, and Compute Information from 1986 to 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; and represents a sustained annual growth rate of some 25%. The world’s combined technological capacity to receive information through one-way [[broadcast]] networks was the informational equivalent of 174 newspapers per person per day in 2007.&lt;ref name="HilbertLopez2011"/&gt;

The world's combined effective capacity to exchange information through two-way [[telecommunication]] networks was 281 [[petabytes]] of (optimally compressed) information in 1986, 471 [[petabytes]] in 1993, 2.2 (optimally compressed) [[exabytes]] in 2000, and 65 (optimally compressed) [[exabytes]] in 2007, which is the informational equivalent of 6 newspapers per person per day in 2007.&lt;ref name="Hilbertvideo2011"/&gt; The world's technological capacity to compute information with humanly guided general-purpose computers grew from 3.0 × 10^8 MIPS in 1986, to 6.4 x 10^12 MIPS in 2007, experiencing the fastest growth rate of over 60% per year during the last two decades.&lt;ref name="HilbertLopez2011"/&gt;

[[James R. Beniger]] describes the necessity of information in modern society in the following way: “The need for sharply increased control that resulted from the industrialization of material processes through application of inanimate sources of energy probably accounts for the rapid development of automatic feedback technology in the early industrial period (1740-1830)” (p.&amp;nbsp;174)
“Even with enhanced feedback control, industry could not have developed without the enhanced means to process matter and energy, not only as inputs of the raw materials of production but also as outputs distributed to final consumption.”(p.&amp;nbsp;175)&lt;ref name="Beniger 1986"/&gt;

==Development of the information society model==
[[File:Clark's Sector Model.png|right|thumb|450px|Colin Clark (economist)|[[Colin Clark (economist)|Colin Clark]]'s sector model of an economy undergoing technological change. In later stages, the [[Quaternary sector of the economy]] grows.]]
One of the first people to develop the concept of the information society was the economist [[Fritz Machlup]]. In 1933, Fritz Machlup began studying the effect of patents on research. His work culminated in the study ''The production and distribution of knowledge in the United States'' in 1962. This book was widely regarded&lt;ref&gt;Susan Crawford: "[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&amp;artid=227258 The Origin and Development of a Concept: The Information Society]". ''Bull Med Libr Assoc.'' 71(4) October 1983: 380–385.&lt;/ref&gt; and was eventually translated into [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. The Japanese have also studied the information society (or ''jōhōka shakai'', [[:ja:情報化社会|情報化社会]]).

The issue of technologies and their role in contemporary society have been discussed in the scientific literature using a range of labels and concepts. This section introduces some of them. Ideas of a knowledge or [[information economy]], [[post-industrial society]], [[postmodernism|postmodern]] society, [[network society]], the [[information revolution]], informational capitalism, network capitalism, and the like, have been debated over the last several decades.

Fritz Machlup (1962) introduced the concept of the [[knowledge economy|knowledge industry]]. He began studying the effects of patents on research before distinguishing five sectors of the knowledge sector: education, research and development, mass media, information technologies, information services. Based on this categorization he calculated that in 1959 29% per cent of the GNP in the USA had been produced in knowledge industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Intellectual Capital, Knowledge Management and Organizational Learning|last=Rooney|first=Jim|publisher=Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited|year=2014|isbn=978-1-910309-71-1|location=UK|pages=261}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Machlup|first1=Fritz|title=The Production and Distribution of Knowledge in the United States|date=1962|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|reason=What's the year referring to?|date=November 2009}}

=== Economic transition ===
[[Peter Drucker]] has argued that there is a transition from an economy based on material goods to one based on knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Drucker]] (1969) ''The Age of Discontinuity''. London: Heinemann&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marc Porat]] distinguishes a primary (information goods and services that are directly used in the production, distribution or processing of information) and a secondary sector (information services produced for internal consumption by government and non-information firms) of the information economy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marc Porat]] (1977) The Information Economy. Washington, DC: US Department of Commerce&lt;/ref&gt;

Porat uses the total value added by the primary and secondary information sector to the GNP as an indicator for the information economy. The [[OECD]] has employed Porat's definition for calculating the share of the information economy in the total economy (e.g. OECD 1981, 1986). Based on such indicators, the information society has been defined as a society where more than half of the GNP is produced and more than half of the employees are active in the information economy.&lt;ref name=deutsch1983&gt;Karl Deutsch (1983) Soziale und politische Aspekte der Informationsgesellschaft. In: Philipp Sonntag (Ed.) (1983) Die Zukunft der Informationsgesellschaft. Frankfurt/Main: Haag &amp; Herchen. pp. 68-88&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Daniel Bell]] the number of employees producing services and information is an indicator for the informational character of a society. "A post-industrial society is based on services. (…) What counts is not raw muscle power, or energy, but information. (…) A post industrial society is one in which the majority of those employed are not involved in the production of tangible goods".&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Bell]] (1976) The Coming of Post-Industrial Society. New York: Basic Books, 127, 348&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alain Touraine]] already spoke in 1971 of the post-industrial society. "The passage to postindustrial society takes place when investment results in the production of symbolic goods that modify values, needs, representations, far more than in the production of material goods or even of 'services'. Industrial society had transformed the means of production: post-industrial society changes the ends of production, that is, culture. (…) The decisive point here is that in postindustrial society all of the economic system is the object of intervention of society upon itself. That is why we can call it the programmed society, because this phrase captures its capacity to create models of management, production, organization, distribution, and consumption, so that such a society appears, at all its functional levels, as the product of an action exercised by the society itself, and not as the outcome of natural laws or cultural specificities" (Touraine 1988: 104). In the programmed society also the area of cultural reproduction including aspects such as information, consumption, health, research, education would be industrialized. That modern society is increasing its capacity to act upon itself means for Touraine that society is reinvesting ever larger parts of production and so produces and transforms itself. This makes Touraine's concept substantially different from that of Daniel Bell who focused on the capacity to process and generate information for efficient society functioning.

[[Jean-François Lyotard]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean-François Lyotard]] (1984) ''The Postmodern Condition''. Manchester: Manchester University Press, 5&lt;/ref&gt; has argued that "knowledge has become the {{sic|principle}} force of production over the last few decades". Knowledge would be transformed into a commodity. Lyotard says that postindustrial society makes knowledge accessible to the layman because knowledge and information technologies would diffuse into society and break up Grand Narratives of centralized structures and groups. Lyotard denotes these changing circumstances as postmodern condition or postmodern society.

Similarly to Bell, Peter Otto and Philipp Sonntag (1985) say that an information society is a society where the majority of employees work in information jobs, i.e. they have to deal more with information, signals, symbols, and images than with energy and matter. [[Radovan Richta]] (1977) argues that society has been transformed into a scientific civilization based on services, education, and creative activities. This transformation would be the result of a scientific-technological transformation based on technological progress and the increasing importance of computer technology. Science and technology would become immediate forces of production (Aristovnik 2014: 55).

[[Nico Stehr]] (1994, 2002a, b) says that in the knowledge society a majority of jobs involves working with knowledge. "Contemporary society may be described as a knowledge society based on the extensive penetration of all its spheres of life and institutions by scientific and technological knowledge" (Stehr 2002b: 18). For Stehr, knowledge is a capacity for social action. Science would become an immediate productive force, knowledge would no longer be primarily embodied in machines, but already appropriated nature that represents knowledge would be rearranged according to certain designs and programs (Ibid.: 41-46). For Stehr, the economy of a knowledge society is largely driven not by material inputs, but by symbolic or knowledge-based inputs (Ibid.: 67), there would be a large number of professions that involve working with knowledge, and a declining number of jobs that demand low cognitive skills as well as in manufacturing (Stehr 2002a).

Also [[Alvin Toffler]] argues that knowledge is the central resource in the economy of the information society: "In a Third Wave economy, the central resource – a single word broadly encompassing data, information, images, symbols, culture, ideology, and values –  is actionable knowledge" (Dyson/Gilder/Keyworth/Toffler 1994).

At the end of the twentieth century, the concept of the [[network society]] gained importance in information society theory. For [[Manuel Castells]], network logic is besides information, pervasiveness, flexibility, and convergence a central feature of the information technology paradigm (2000a: 69ff). "One of the key features of informational society is the networking logic of its basic structure, which explains the use of the concept of 'network society'" (Castells 2000: 21). "As an historical trend, dominant functions and processes in the Information Age are increasingly organized around networks. Networks constitute the new social morphology of our societies, and the diffusion of networking logic substantially modifies the operation and outcomes in processes of production, experience, power, and culture" (Castells 2000: 500). For Castells the network society is the result of informationalism, a new technological paradigm.

[[Jan Van Dijk]] (2006) defines the network society as a "social formation with an infrastructure of social and media networks enabling its prime mode of organization at all levels (individual, group/organizational and societal). Increasingly, these networks link all units or parts of this formation (individuals, groups and organizations)" (Van Dijk 2006: 20). For Van Dijk networks have become the nervous system of society, whereas Castells links the concept of the network society to capitalist transformation, Van Dijk sees it as the logical result of the increasing widening and thickening of networks in nature and society. [[Darin Barney]] uses the term for characterizing societies that exhibit two fundamental characteristics: "The first is the presence in those societies of sophisticated – almost exclusively digital – technologies of networked communication and information management/distribution, technologies which form the basic infrastructure mediating an increasing array of social, political and economic practices. (…) The second, arguably more intriguing, characteristic of network societies is the reproduction and institutionalization throughout (and between) those societies of networks as the basic form of human organization and relationship across a wide range of social, political and economic configurations and associations".&lt;ref&gt;[[Darin Barney]] (2003) The Network Society. Cambridge: Polity, 25sq&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Critiques ===
The major critique of concepts such as information society, knowledge society, network society, postmodern society, postindustrial society, etc. that has mainly been voiced by critical scholars is that they create the impression that we have entered a completely new type of society. "If there is just more information then it is hard to understand why anyone should suggest that we have before us something radically new" (Webster 2002a: 259). Critics such as [[Frank Webster (sociologist)|Frank Webster]] argue that these approaches stress discontinuity, as if contemporary society had nothing in common with society as it was 100 or 150 years ago. Such assumptions would have ideological character because they would fit with the view that we can do nothing about change and have to adopt to existing political realities (kasiwulaya 2002b: 267).

These critics argue that contemporary society first of all is still a capitalist society oriented towards accumulating economic, political, and [[cultural capital]]. They acknowledge that information society theories stress some important new qualities of society (notably globalization and informatization), but charge that they fail to show that these are attributes of overall capitalist structures. Critics such as Webster insist on the continuities that characterise change. In this way Webster distinguishes between different epochs of capitalism: laissez-faire capitalism of the 19th century, [[corporate capitalism]] in the 20th century, and informational capitalism for the 21st century (kasiwulaya 2006).

For describing contemporary society based on a dialectic of the old and the new, continuity and discontinuity, other critical scholars have suggested several terms like:
* transnational network capitalism, transnational informational capitalism ([[Christian Fuchs (sociologist)|Christian Fuchs]] 2008, 2007): "Computer networks are the technological foundation that has allowed the emergence of global network capitalism, that is, regimes of accumulation, regulation, and discipline that are helping to increasingly base the accumulation of economic, political, and cultural capital on transnational network organizations that make use of cyberspace and other new technologies for global coordination and communication. [...] The need to find new strategies for executing corporate and political domination has resulted in a restructuration of capitalism that is characterized by the emergence of transnational, networked spaces in the economic, political, and cultural system and has been mediated by cyberspace as a tool of global coordination and communication. Economic, political, and cultural space have been restructured; they have become more fluid and dynamic, have enlarged their borders to a transnational scale, and handle the inclusion and exclusion of nodes in flexible ways. These networks are complex due to the high number of nodes (individuals, enterprises, teams, political actors, etc.) that can be involved and the high speed at which a high number of resources is produced and transported within them. But global network capitalism is based on structural inequalities; it is made up of segmented spaces in which central hubs (transnational corporations, certain political actors, regions, countries, Western lifestyles, and worldviews) centralize the production, control, and flows of economic, political, and cultural capital (property, power, definition capacities). This segmentation is an expression of the overall competitive character of contemporary society." (Fuchs 2008: 110+119).
* digital capitalism (Schiller 2000, cf. also [[Peter Glotz]]):&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Glotz]] (1999) Die beschleunigte Gesellschaft. Kulturkämpfe im digitalen Kapitalismus. München: Kindler.&lt;/ref&gt; "networks are directly generalizing the social and cultural range of the capitalist economy as never before" (Schiller 2000: xiv)
* virtual capitalism: the "combination of marketing and the new information technology will enable certain firms to obtain higher profit margins and larger market shares, and will thereby promote greater concentration and centralization of capital" (Dawson/[[John Bellamy Foster]] 1998: 63sq),
* high-tech capitalism&lt;ref&gt;[[Wolfgang Fritz Haug]] (2003) High-Tech-Kapitalismus. Hamburg: Argument.&lt;/ref&gt; or informatic capitalism (Fitzpatrick 2002) – to focus on the computer as a guiding technology that has transformed the productive forces of capitalism and has enabled a globalized economy.

Other scholars prefer to speak of information capitalism (Morris-Suzuki 1997) or informational capitalism ([[Manuel Castells]] 2000, [[Christian Fuchs (sociologist)|Christian Fuchs]] 2005, Schmiede 2006a, b). Manuel Castells sees informationalism as a new technological paradigm (he speaks of a mode of development) characterized by "information generation, processing, and transmission" that have become "the fundamental sources of productivity and power" (Castells 2000: 21). The "most decisive historical factor accelerating, channelling and shaping the information technology paradigm, and inducing its associated social forms, was/is the process of capitalist restructuring undertaken since the 1980s, so that the new techno-economic system can be adequately characterized as informational capitalism" (Castells 2000: 18). Castells has added to theories of the information society the idea that in contemporary society dominant functions and processes are increasingly organized around networks that constitute the new social morphology of society (Castells 2000: 500). [[Nicholas Garnham]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Garnham]] (2004) Information Society Theory as Ideology. In: Frank Webster (Ed.) (2004) The Information Society Reader. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; is critical of Castells and argues that the latter’s account is technologically determinist because Castells points out that his approach is based on a dialectic of technology and society in which technology embodies society and society uses technology (Castells 2000: 5sqq). But Castells also makes clear that the rise of a new "mode of development" is shaped by capitalist production, i.e. by society, which implies that technology isn't the only driving force of society.

[[Antonio Negri]] and [[Michael Hardt]] argue that contemporary society is an Empire that is characterized by a singular global logic of capitalist domination that is based on immaterial labour. With the concept of immaterial labour Negri and Hardt introduce ideas of information society discourse into their Marxist account of contemporary capitalism. Immaterial labour would be labour "that creates immaterial products, such as knowledge, information, communication, a relationship, or an emotional response" (Hardt/Negri 2005: 108; cf. also 2000: 280-303), or services, cultural products, knowledge (Hardt/Negri 2000: 290). There would be two forms: intellectual labour that produces ideas, symbols, codes, texts, linguistic figures, images, etc.; and [[affective labor|affective labour]] that produces and manipulates affects such as a feeling of ease, well-being, satisfaction, excitement, passion, joy, sadness, etc. (Ibid.).

Overall, neo-Marxist accounts of the information society have in common that they stress that knowledge, information technologies, and computer networks have played a role in the restructuration and globalization of capitalism and the emergence of a flexible regime of accumulation ([[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] 1989). They warn that new technologies are embedded into societal antagonisms that cause [[structural unemployment]], rising poverty, [[social exclusion]], the [[deregulation]] of the [[welfare state]] and of [[labour rights]], the lowering of wages, welfare, etc.

Concepts such as knowledge society, information society, network society, informational capitalism, postindustrial society, transnational network capitalism, postmodern society, etc. show that there is a vivid discussion in contemporary sociology on the character of contemporary society and the role that technologies, information, communication, and co-operation play in it.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Information society theory discusses the role of information and information technology in society, the question which key concepts shall be used for characterizing contemporary society, and how to define such concepts. It has become a specific branch of contemporary sociology.

==Second and third nature==
{{One source section|date=August 2017}}
Information society is the means of getting information from one place to another.{{sfn|Wark|1997|p=22}} As technology has advanced so too has the way people have adapted in sharing this information with each other.

"Second nature" refers a group of experiences that get made over by culture.{{sfn|Wark|1997|p=23}} They then get remade into something else that can then take on a new meaning. As a society we transform this process so it becomes something natural to us, i.e. second nature. So, by following a particular pattern created by culture we are able to recognise how we use and move information in different ways. From sharing information via different time zones (such as talking online) to information ending up in a different location (sending a letter overseas) this has all become a habitual process that we as a society take for granted.{{sfn|Wark|1997|p=21}}

However, through the process of sharing information vectors have enabled us to spread information even further. Through the use of these vectors information is able to move and then separate from the initial things that enabled them to move.{{sfn|Wark|1997|p=24}} From here, something called "third nature" has developed. An extension of second nature, third nature is in control of second nature. It expands on what second nature is limited by. It has the ability to mould information in new and different ways. So, third nature is able to ‘speed up, proliferate, divide, mutate, and beam in on us from else where.{{sfn|Wark|1997|p=25}} It aims to create a balance between the boundaries of space and time (see second nature). This can be seen through the telegraph, it was the first successful technology that could send and receive information faster than a human being could move an object.{{sfn|Wark|1997|p=26}} As a result different vectors of people have the ability to not only shape culture but create new possibilities that will ultimately shape society.

Therefore, through the use of second nature and third nature society is able to use and explore new vectors of possibility where information can be moulded to create new forms of interaction.{{sfn|Wark|1997|p=28}}

==Sociological uses==

In [[sociology]], '''''informational society''''' refers to a [[postmodernity|post-modern]] type of society. Theoreticians like [[Ulrich Beck]], [[Anthony Giddens]] and [[Manuel Castells]] argue that since the 1970s a transformation from [[industrial society]] to informational society has happened on a global scale.&lt;ref&gt;[[Leonid Grinin|Grinin, L.]] 2007. Periodization of History: A theoretic-mathematical analysis. In: [http://urss.ru/cgi-bin/db.pl?cp=&amp;page=Book&amp;id=53184&amp;lang=en&amp;blang=en&amp;list=1 ''History &amp; Mathematics''].

As [[steam power]] was the technology standing behind industrial society, so [[information technology]] is seen as the catalyst for the changes in work organisation, societal structure and politics occurring in the late 20th century.

In the book ''[[Future Shock]]'', [[Alvin Toffler]] used the phrase '''super-industrial society''' to describe this type of society.  Other writers and thinkers have used terms like "[[post-industrial society]]" and "post-modern industrial society" with a similar meaning.

== Related terms ==
A number of terms in current use emphasize related but different aspects of the emerging global economic order.  The Information Society intends to be the most encompassing in that an economy is a subset of a society.  The [[Information Age]] is somewhat limiting, in that it refers to a 30-year period between the widespread use of computers and the [[knowledge economy]], rather than an emerging economic order.  The knowledge era is about the nature of the content, not the socioeconomic processes by which it will be traded.  The [[computer revolution]], and knowledge revolution refer to specific revolutionary transitions, rather than the end state towards which we are evolving. The [[Information Revolution]] relates with the well known terms agricultural revolution and [[industrial revolution]].
* The [[information economy]] and the [[knowledge economy]] emphasize the [[Content (media and publishing)|content]] or [[intellectual property]] that is being traded through an information market or [[knowledge market]], respectively. [[Electronic commerce]] and [[electronic business]] emphasize the nature of transactions and running a business, respectively, using the [[Internet]] and [[World-Wide Web]].  The [[digital economy]] focuses on trading bits in [[cyberspace]] rather than atoms in physical space.  The network economy stresses that businesses will work collectively in webs or as part of business ecosystems rather than as stand-alone units. [[Social networking]] refers to the process of collaboration on massive, global scales.  The [[internet economy]] focuses on the nature of markets that are enabled by the Internet.
* Knowledge services and knowledge value put content into an economic context. Knowledge services integrates [[Knowledge management]], within a [[Knowledge organization]], that trades in a [[Knowledge market]]. In order for individuals to receive more knowledge, surveillance is used. This relates to the use of Drones as a tool in order to gather knowledge on other individuals. Although seemingly synonymous, each term conveys more than nuances or slightly different views of the same thing.  Each term represents one attribute of the likely nature of economic activity in the emerging post-industrial society.  Alternatively, the new economic order will incorporate all of the above plus other attributes that have not yet fully emerged.
* In connection with the development of the information society, appeared [[information pollution]], evolving [[information ecology]] - associated with information [[hygiene]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240515256_Information_ecology__a_viewpoint?ev=prf_pub Eryomin A.L. Information ecology - a viewpoint]// International Journal of Environmental Studies. - 1998. - Vol. 54. - pp. 241-253.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, It is important to selectively select the information. Due to information revolution, the amount of information is puzzling. Among these, we need to develop techniques that refine information. This is called ''data mining.'' It is an engineering term, but it is used in sociology. In other words, if the amount of information was competitive in the past, the quality of information is important today.

==Intellectual property considerations==
One of the central paradoxes of the information society is that it makes information easily reproducible, leading to a variety of freedom/control problems relating to [[intellectual property]]. Essentially, business and capital, whose place becomes that of producing and selling information and knowledge, seems to require control over this new resource so that it can effectively be managed and sold as the basis of the information economy. However, such control can prove to be both technically and socially problematic. Technically because [[copy protection]] is often easily circumvented and socially ''rejected'' because the users and citizens of the information society can prove to be unwilling to accept such absolute [[commodification]] of the facts and information that compose their environment.

Responses to this concern range from the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] in the United States (and similar legislation elsewhere) which make [[copy protection]] (see [[Digital Rights Management|DRM]]) circumvention illegal, to the [[free software]], [[open source]] and [[copyleft]] movements, which seek to encourage and disseminate the "freedom" of various information products (traditionally both as in "gratis" or free of cost, and liberty, as in freedom to use, explore and share).

Caveat: Information society is often used by politicians meaning something like "we all do internet now"; the sociological term information society (or informational society) has some deeper implications about change of societal structure. Because we lack political control of intellectual property, we are lacking in a concrete map of issues, an analysis of costs and benefits, and functioning political groups that are unified by common interests representing different opinions of this diverse situation that are prominent in the information society.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, James. “A Politics of Intellectual Property: Environmentalism for the Net?” Duke Law Journal, vol. 47, no. 1, 1997, pp. 87–116. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/1372861.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8924">[[File:Inglehart Values Map.svg|thumb|301x301px|A recreation of the map, 2008 version]]
The '''Inglehart–Welzel cultural map of the world''' is a map, or more precisely, a [[scatter plot]] created by political scientists [[Ronald Inglehart]] and [[Christian Welzel]] based on the [[World Values Survey]]. It depicts closely linked cultural values that vary between societies in two predominant dimensions: traditional versus secular-rational values on the vertical [[y-axis]] and survival versus [[self-expression values]] on the horizontal [[x-axis]]. Moving upward on this map reflects the shift from traditional values to secular-rational ones and moving rightward reflects the shift from survival values to self-expression values.

According to the authors: "These two dimensions explain more than 70 percent of the cross-national variance in a factor analysis of ten indicators—and each of these dimensions is strongly correlated with scores of other important orientations."&lt;ref name=wvs-old&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs/articles/folder_published/article_base_54 |title=The WVS Cultural Map of the World |publisher=WVS |author1=Ronald Inglehart |author2=Chris Welzel |accessdate=6 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019112321/http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs/articles/folder_published/article_base_54 |archivedate=October 19, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors stress that socio-economic status is not the sole factor determining a country's location, as their religious and cultural historical heritage is also an important factor.&lt;ref name="EngelbrektNygren2014"/&gt;

==Values==
Analysis of the World Values Survey data by Inglehart and Welzel asserts that there are two major dimensions of cross-cultural variation in the world: 
# x-axis: Survival values versus self-expression values
# y-axis: Traditional values versus secular-rational values.&lt;ref name=wvs-old/&gt;

The map is not a geographical map but rather a [[chart]] in which countries are positioned based on their scores for the two values mapped on the x-axis (survival values versus self-expression values) and the y-axis (traditional values versus secular-rational values).&lt;ref name=wvs-old/&gt; The map shows where societies are located in these two dimensions. Clusters of countries reflect their shared values and not geographical closeness.&lt;ref name=wvs-old/&gt;

Traditional values emphasize the importance of religion, parent-child ties, deference to [[Authority (sociology)|authority]], absolute standards and traditional family values. People who embrace these values also reject divorce, abortion, euthanasia and suicide. Societies that embrace these values have high levels of national pride and a nationalistic outlook.&lt;ref name=wvs-old/&gt;

Secular-rational values have the opposite preferences to the traditional values. Societies that embrace these values place less emphasis on religion, traditional family values and authority. Divorce, abortion, euthanasia and suicide are seen as relatively acceptable.&lt;ref name=wvs-old/&gt;

The shift from traditional to secular-rational values has been described by Engelbrekt and Nygren as "essentially the replacement of religion and superstition with science and bureaucracy".&lt;ref name="EngelbrektNygren2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kjell Engelbrekt|author2=Bertil Nygren|title=Russia and Europe: Building Bridges, Digging Trenches|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fR4iAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA32|date=18 March 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-99201-8|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Survival values place emphasis on economic and physical security.&lt;ref name=wvs-old/&gt; They are linked with a relatively [[ethnocentric]] outlook and low levels of trust and tolerance.

Self-expression values give high priority to subjective well-being, self-expression and quality of life.&lt;ref name=wvs-old/&gt; Some values more common in societies that embrace these values include environmental protection, growing tolerance of foreigners, gays and lesbians and gender equality, rising demands for participation in decision-making in economic and political life (autonomy and freedom from central authority), interpersonal trust, political moderation, and a shift in child-rearing values from emphasis on hard work toward imagination and tolerance.&lt;ref name=wvs-old/&gt;

The shift from survival to self-expression also represents the transition from [[industrial society]] to [[post-industrial society]], as well as embracing [[democratic values]].&lt;ref name=wvs-old/&gt;&lt;ref name="Simoni2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Serena Simoni|title=Understanding Transatlantic Relations: Whither the West?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KqCxDtTs3S8C&amp;pg=RA1-PT149|date=29 May 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-47695-2|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clusters==
Countries can be divided into nine clusters: the [[Anglosphere|English-speaking]], [[Latin America]], [[Catholic]] Europe, [[Protestant]] Europe, African-Islamic, [[Baltic states|Baltic]], [[South Asian]], [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]] and [[Confucian]] clusters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WVS Database|url=http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/WVSContents.jsp|website=www.worldvaluessurvey.org|accessdate=9 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In previous studies, the African-Islamic cluster was split into two (the [[Africa|African]] cluster and the [[Islamic]] cluster) and the Baltic states did not have their own cluster.&lt;ref name="WestwoodJack2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert Westwood|author2=Gavin Jack|author3=Farzad Khan|author4=Michal Frenkel|title=Core-Periphery Relations and Organization Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TRpvBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA64|date=29 August 2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-137-30905-1|pages=64–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another proposed way to cluster the societies is by wealth, with the poor societies at the bottom of both axes, and rich at the top.&lt;ref name="InglehartWelzel2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ronald Inglehart|author2=Christian Welzel|title=Modernization, Cultural Change, and Democracy: The Human Development Sequence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O4APtKh7JqQC&amp;pg=PA57|date=8 August 2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-45988-4|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Country-specific analysis==
Out of [[Western world]] countries, the United States is among the most conservative (as one of the most downwards-located countries), together with highly conservative Catholic countries such as Ireland and Poland.&lt;ref name="AnheierIsar2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Helmut K Anheier|author2=Yudhishthir Raj Isar|title=Cultures and Globalization: Conflicts and Tensions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5eV3hMR7lmoC&amp;pg=PA243|date=27 March 2007|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-84860-737-8|pages=243–245}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simoni concludes that "On the traditional/secular dimension, the United States ranks far below other rich societies, with levels of religiosity and national pride comparable with those found in some developing societies" (roughly, between Iran and Iraq).&lt;ref name="Simoni2013"/&gt;

Asian societies are distributed in the traditional/secular dimension in two clusters, with more secular Confucian societies at the top, and more traditional South Asian ones at the center of the map.&lt;ref name="WittRedding2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael A. Witt|author2=Gordon Redding|title=The Oxford Handbook of Asian Business Systems|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tuunAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA370|date=23 January 2014|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-162655-5|page=370}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russia is among the most survival-value oriented countries, and at the other end, Sweden ranks highest on the self-expression chart.&lt;ref name="EngelbrektNygren2014"/&gt;

It has also been found that basic cultural values overwhelmingly apply on national lines, with cross-border intermixtures being relatively rare. This is true even between countries with shared cultural histories. Additionally, even cultural clusters of countries do not intermix much across borders. This suggests nations are culturally meaningful units.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Minkov; Geert Hofstede [http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1069397111427262 "Is National Culture a Meaningful Concept?"], accessed 06/08/2017 &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4649">"'''Joke'''" is a [[comedy]] [[sketch comedy|sketch]] written and performed by [[English people|English]] [[comedian]]s [[Rowan Atkinson]] and [[Richard Curtis]]. It was performed live during Atkinson's 1980 tour of the [[United Kingdom]]. A live recording was made at the [[Grand Opera House (Belfast)|Grand Opera House]] in [[Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]], on 19 or 20 September 1980 and released as the last track on Atkinson's [[live album|live]] comedy [[album]], ''[[Live in Belfast]]''.

==Synopsis==
At the start of the sketch, Rowan Atkinson's character tells Richard Curtis' character he's "got a [[joke]]". He goes on to explain, "It's one of those ones where I ask a question and you say 'I don't know, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot'." Rowan begins the joke by saying, "I say, I say, I say, what is the secret of great comedy?" Richard replies by literally saying, "I don't know, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot." After laughing at his own wit, Richard tells the annoyed Rowan that he'll "do it again." Rowan repeats the question and Richard replies, "I don't know. What is the secret to great comedy?" However, before Richard can finish his reply, Rowan interrupts, "timing." The point of the joke is that Rowan deliberately got his timing wrong when saying that timing is the secret to great comedy; however, Richard does not understand the joke. Bewildered by Richard's stupidity, Rowan enquires, "But didn't you see?" "Sorry, was it a visual joke?" Richard replies, still confused. After trying the joke a third time, Richard still does not understand the [[irony]] of the joke. Annoyed by Richard, Rowan asks, "Don't you think that's a clever joke?" to which Richard replies, "Clever... no. Joke... no." Disheartened by his joke falling flat with Richard, he claims "it was very funny when Michael told it," then makes the excuse that his timing might be out to which Richard replies, "It could be other factors like the complete absence of anything funny in the joke." Rowan proclaims, "It's so difficult telling jokes," before suddenly exclaiming that he has another joke that is "far more straightforward" to which Richard replies, "As long as it's funny, I don't mind."

The second joke begins with Rowan saying, "Knock! Knock! Who's there? Death..." but he is interrupted by Richard who complains that [[knock-knock joke]]s "are meant to be two-handers". Rowan argues that this joke "doesn't work that way". It becomes apparent that Rowan is attempting to tell the same joke told by Toby, the [[Devil]], during a previous sketch. The joke is meant to go "Knock, Knock. Who's there? Death. Death wh..." at which point the person telling the joke pretends to die. If a second person was replying in the joke, they would not know to pretend to die when saying "Death who?". Richard protests and Rowan gives in and the pair attempt the knock-knock joke in the "old way". Richard, ignorant to the fact he is meant to say the [[punch line]], replies "Death who?" and Rowan replies "Ah, now, that's where it goes wrong." Rowan explains to Richard how he is meant to say the punch-line but after another attempt at the joke, Richard replies wrong. Rowan, getting increasingly more annoyed as the sketch goes on, says he has another joke and this time he will be "third time lucky".

Rowan explains that the third joke is "a very old joke but a very good joke". Rowan begins to tell the classic joke, which begins "I say, I say, I say, my wife's gone to [[Jamaica]]". The person replying is meant to say, "Jamaica?" which sounds like "D'you make 'er?" or "Did you make her?". The joke-teller then replies, "No, of her own accord." However, when Rowan says, "I say, I say, I say, my wife's gone to Jamaica," Richard replies, "Of her own accord?" which ruins the whole joke and causes Rowan to [[profanity|swear]] loudly and give up telling jokes to Richard.

'''Kofei''' is a [[Papuan languages|Papuan language]] of the [[Indonesia]]n province of [[Papua (province)|Papua]], on the eastern shore of [[Cenderawasih Bay]].

Kofei is lexically similar to the [[East Geelvink Bay languages]] and presumably belongs in that family, but is too poorly attested to be sure.

}}'''Lampetho''' was an [[Amazons|Amazon]] queen mentioned by French medieval poet [[Eustache Deschamps]]. She was a member of the female version of Deschamps' [[nine worthies]], individuals who along with their male counterparts were historical, scriptural and legendary personages who embodied the ideals of chivalry, honor and privilege. 

In 1591 German Lutheran theologian, pastor and historian [[Cyriacus Spangenberg]] added more detail about her and her fellow Amazons in his ''WeiberAdel''. This work, the last part of his 921-page folio on the mythical and historical origins of the [[Germany|German]] nobility entitled ''Der AdelsSpiegel'', is a celebration of female achievements. To that end, the work is filled with examples of women who serve as archetypes of virtues that should be imitated. Such an intuition might instill women with their own sense of virtue and thus, develop a proper sense of [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] piety.

== ''WeiberAdel'' ==
In ''WeiberAdel'' several groups of Amazons are mentioned: the first of Lybian origin was described as both vicious and magnanimous and came to Europe from Africa under the direction of a Queen Myrina (after they had slaughtered all their men folk) via traversing Spain and crossing the ocean. They eventually emigrated to the lands of [[Sarmatians|Sarmatia]] after intermarrying with the [[Scythians|Scythian]] peoples who had warred with them initially, under the mistaken impression of them being men. Later, a second godly group of Amazons of Germanic stock is introduced from whom Lampetho descended.

According to a story in the work that related the origins of this latter group of Amazons, the Germanic King Taurer (a descendant of the earlier King Alemann) was faced with a rising population, leading him to lead groups of people south into [[Hungary]] and down the [[Danube]] to a place near the [[Black Sea]] to resettle them. Among the group were single women and widows who were "wild and ardent" to the point that he could rely on them more than the men on the journey. As a reward for their valor, the women were given land sticking out into the water, from which they later staged war and conquered the lands of [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]] and [[Cappadocia]]. These Amazons were rendered monstrous by their rage, allowed no trespassers on their lands. Their descendants later went on to conquer all of [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]].

They added to the legend of the better-known Greek legend of the Amazons (each capturing a man a month for reproduction, wearing men's clothes, leaving one breast bare and burning off one nipple to improve bow usage). In this version they also made drinking vessels from the skulls of the generals they captured to offer up sacrifices to the goddess Heeres or [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], and showed them as a civilizing force of city builders willing to go to war to free the oppressed from injustice (noted in the work as unlike many men of the time who fought only for glory, defense or conquest). 

Among the most prominent of the Amazon queens were Lampetho, who was in charge of internal order among the Amazons, and [[Marpesia]], who was in charge of making war outside the borders. According to the work, around the year 1271 B.C (which in Spangenberg's chronology was some 2700 years after the creation of the world) Marpesia was reportedly attacked and defeated in a battle with famed Greek hero, and slayer of the [[Chimera (mythology)|Chimera]], [[Bellerophon]] when they attempted to invade [[Lycia]].&lt;ref&gt;"Wenn sie das Wort Ich gebraucht": Festschrift für Barbara Becker-Cantarino von FreundInnen, SchülerInnen und KollegInnen (Chloe) pg. 191 - 198 {{ISBN|978-9042037038}} ,  {{ISBN|9042037032}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3175">'''Lifestyle management''' is the [[outsourcing]] of personal tasks to commercial firms and individuals. Lifestyle managers or [[personal assistant]]s act as an intermediary between suppliers of commercial services and [[consumer]]s who are unwilling or unable to carry out a given task for themselves. These firms typically present their offer in terms of time-saving or access to expertise, with some firms also positioning their service as a [[luxury goods|luxury good]].

==History==
Although [[high-net-worth individual|high-net-worth]] households have traditionally made use of service staff, these staff were typically employees who carried out tasks themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Stephanie Watson|title=History and the Future of the Concierge Industry|url=http://people.howstuffworks.com/concierge4.htm|website=How Stuff Works|publisher=Infospace|accessdate=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lifestyle management as a standalone service first came to prominence in the late 1990s, with the rise of "mass affluent" and high net worth consumers, and the launch of services such as [[First Direct|First Direct's]] Octopus and [[Natwest|NatWest's]] Zender (both now defunct).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Buckingham|first1=Lisa|title=Octopus spreads at First Direct|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/1998/dec/30/8|website=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian Media Group|accessdate=16 March 2015|date=30 December 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both were mass-market services created to drive traffic to banking websites. This "B-2-B-C" (business-to-business-to-consumer) model is still followed by lifestyle management firms, though many firms are also retained directly by their clients. [[HR Magazine]] reports that 15% of large employers in the US offer [[concierge service]]s to their staff.&lt;ref name="HR Magazine"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Suzy Bashford|title=Concierge services grow as a popular employee benefit|url=http://www.hrmagazine.co.uk/hr/features/1015034/concierge-services-grow-popular-employee-benefit|website=HRMagazine.co.uk|publisher=MA Business &amp; Leisure Limited|accessdate=17 March 2015|date=23 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industry==

A 2010 report by Oxford Brookes University estimated the global market for concierge services to be worth around $1bn, and suggested the most popular use for a concierge service is sourcing and booking restaurants (46%), followed by sourcing and booking a holiday (32%) and to helping to arrange business travel (27%).&lt;ref name="International trade"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Bob Northgate|title=Customers Switching Providers Costs UK businesses Over £3 Billion In Two Years|url=http://www.internationaltrade.co.uk/news.php?NID=433|website=InternationalTrade.co.uk|publisher=International Trade|accessdate=17 March 2015|date=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lifestyle management industry has a number of [[trade group]]s, many of which are closely affiliated to the hospitality industry, such as Les Clefs D'Or&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lesclefsdor.org/&lt;/ref&gt; and The International Concierge and Lifestyle Management Association.&lt;ref&gt;http://iclmdirectory.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Margaret Eleanor Parker''' (1827–1896) was a British social activist, social reformer, and travel writer who was involved in the [[temperance movement]].{{sfn|Blocker|Fahey|Tyrrell|2003|p=xxviii}} She was a founding member of the [[British Women's Temperance Association]] (BWTA) in 1876,{{sfn|Stevenson|1907|p=52}} and served as its first president.{{sfn|Blocker|Fahey|Tyrrell|2003|p=115}} Born in England, Parker resided in Scotland.{{sfn|Blocker|Fahey|Tyrrell|2003|p=388, 522}} She was a delegate to the 1876 [[International Organisation of Good Templars]] (IOGT) meeting which led to the formation of the BWTA. She was also instrumental in founding the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union#The World's WCTU|World Woman's Christian Temperance Union]] (WWCTU). In 1881, she founded another type of women's association, one which focused on horticulture and supply, but it did not flourish.{{sfn|Blocker|Fahey|Tyrrell|2003|p=476}} Parker described her travels in the [[Eastern United States]] in ''Six Happy Months amongst the Americans'' (1874).{{sfn|Blocker|Fahey|Tyrrell|2003|p=476}}

==Early years==
Parker was born in England,{{sfn|Blocker|Fahey|Tyrrell|2003|p=388, 522}} of an old Tory or Conservative line.{{sfn|Willard|1888|p=114-18}}

==Career==
Her beneficent activities began in that department of church work where women have always been allowed an "equal right" with men, viz.: that of paying off church debts and raising funds for "church extension." Nothing succeeds like success, and Parker was never associated with a losing enterprise.{{sfn|Willard|1888|p=114-18}}

"An orthodox of the orthodox," she worked for woman suffrage side by side with the party of [[John Stuart Mill]]. A wife, mother, and housekeeper of the New England school, she addressed the British Social Science Congress on the question of capital and labor. A modest, soft-voiced woman, she marshaled " the bonnets of bonny Dundee," leading a procession of 60 of her townswomen to the headquarters of the magistrate, where they presented a no-license petition with 9,000 names of women — all this in the days of the [[Women's Christian Temperance Union]] "Crusade," and under its inspiration.{{sfn|Willard|1888|p=114-18}} 

Parker was a great admirer of the U.S. She and her husband were converted by [[John B. Gough]] after one of his lectures in Dundee, becoming total abstainers. In their zeal, they banished not only wine bottles, decanters, and glasses from their sideboard, but, forgetting that they should continue to drink "Adam's ale," sent away their tumblers also. Concerning her appreciation of "Yankee Notions," Parker once wrote: "I have an American cook stove in my kitchen, an American sewing-machine in my sitting-room, and all the American books I can get in my library, and now I must have your wide-awake American paper, the Boston ''Woman's Journal''."{{sfn|Willard|1888|p=114-18}}

Active as she had always been in reforms, the Crusade movement stirred Parker as nothing else had ever done. The presentation of her temperance petition to the authorities of Dundee struck the key-note for the United Kingdom, aroused Christian women to a sense of their responsibility, and led to the organization of temperance unions in Dundee and many other towns. The press having brought to her the name of [[Mother Stewart]] of [[Ohio]], as prominently connected with the Crusade, Parker invited her to Scotland, and arranged a temperance trip for her which greatly enlisted the public interest, and from which resulted a meeting in April 1876, at [[Newcastle-on-Tyne]].{{sfn|Murray|Stark|2016|p=129}} Delegates from all parts of the UK were present. Women who had never spoken on a platform before spoke with fluency and convincing earnestness, and proceeded, with all due observance of parliamentary forms, to organize the "British Women's Christian Temperance Union." Parker was elected president of this new society, and was sent as a delegate to the Woman's International Temperance Convention which met in the Academy of Music, [[Philadelphia]], in June 1876. There, Parker was unanimously elected President of the Woman's International Christian Temperance Union, the avowed object of which was "to spread a temperance Gospel to the ends of the earth.

Twice after the Crusade, Parker visited the U.S. to study the spirit and methods of the WCTU work. A book, entitled ''Six Happy Weeks among the Americans'', recorded her impression of the land she had so long desired to see. A reception was given her by [[Sorosis]], and she was elected a member of that society and of the [[World's Congress of Representative Women]].{{sfn|Willard|1888|p=114-18}}  

Parker was not an orator, but her refined manners and gentle presence, combined with her strong sense and ready wit, made her one of the favorite speakers at the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] of 1893,{{sfn|Murray|Stark|2016|p=129}} called by the National Temperance Society, of which [[John Newton Stearns]] was Secretary.{{sfn|Willard|1888|p=114-18}} 

Nowhere was her influence so great as in her own city. Twice she was offered a place on the School Board of Dundee, which she declined only that she might give her time to the work of the local Woman's Temperance Union, of which she was President since its organization, and to the duties of her more distinguished but hardly more onerous office as President of the international temperance union.{{sfn|Willard|1888|p=114-18}} 

==Personal life==
She married Edward Parker, proprietor of an extensive manufactory in Dundee. He was a member of a prominent Wesleyan Methodist manufacturing family of that city.{{sfn|Smitley|2013|p=1775}} They had six children — five sons, one daughter. Their residence, The Cliff, "looked off upon the German Ocean and old St. Andrew's of classic memory." It was a model Scotch home. After [[Margaret Bright Lucas]] succeeded her as president of the BWTA, Parker and her family lived in England, working side by side with her successor.{{sfn|Willard|1888|p=114-18}} Like Lucas, Parker was a [[Quaker]].{{sfn|Black|2015|p=31}} She died in [[Dundee]] in November 1896.{{sfn|Blocker|Fahey|Tyrrell|2003|p=xxviii}}{{sfn|Murray|Stark|2016|p=129}}

[[File:Ballinagree.jpg|right|thumb|400px|Large menhir located between Millstreet and Ballinagree, [[County Cork]], Ireland]]

A '''menhir''' (from [[Brittonic languages]]: ''maen'' or ''men'', "stone" and ''hir'' or ''hîr'', "long"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/menhir|title=Menhir|last=Anon|work=The Free Dictionary|publisher=Farlex, Inc.|accessdate=15 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;), '''standing stone''', '''orthostat''', '''lith''' is a large man-made upright stone, typically dating from the European [[middle Bronze Age]]. They can be found solely as [[monolith]]s, or as part of a group of similar stones. Menhirs' size can vary considerably, but they are generally uneven and squared, often tapering towards the top. 

They are widely distributed across Europe, Africa and Asia, but most numerous in Western Europe; particularly in Ireland, Great Britain, [[Brittany]] and France, where there are about 50,000 examples,&lt;ref name="Greene"&gt;{{cite book|last=Greene|first=Janice|title=Strange But True Stories|date=January 2006|isbn=1-59905-010-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Nic-eFE2LAC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;lpg=PA43&amp;dq=%2250,000+megaliths%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nE6tXPe2VP&amp;sig=hubpu-AdDz806TG4JedMbXPLrcg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ztRWToinMNLjsQLp2tXLDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%2250%2C000%20megaliths%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=25 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; while there are 1,200 menhirs in northwest France alone.&lt;ref&gt;Oliphant, Margaret "The Atlas Of The Ancient World" 1992 p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; Standing stones are usually difficult to date, but pottery, or pottery shards, found underneath some in [[Atlantic]] Europe connects them with the [[Beaker people]]. They were constructed during many different periods across pre-history as part of the larger [[megalith]]ic cultures in Europe and near areas.

Some menhirs have been erected next to buildings that often have an early or current religious significance. One example is the South Zeal Menhir in Devon, which formed the basis for a 12th-century [[monastery]] built by lay monks. The monastery later became the Oxenham Arms hotel, at South Zeal, and the standing stone remains in place in the ancient [[Pub#Snug|snug bar]] at the hotel.

Where menhirs appear in groups, often in a circular, oval, [[henge]] or horseshoe formation, they are sometimes called megalithic monuments. These are sites of ancient religious ceremonies, sometimes containing burial chambers.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Roberts, Heavy Words Lightly Thrown: The Reason Behind Rhyme, Thorndike Press,2006 ({{ISBN|0-7862-8517-6}})&lt;/ref&gt; The exact function of menhirs has provoked more debate than practically any other issue in [[Prehistoric Europe|European pre-history]]. Over the centuries, they have variously been thought to have been used by [[Druids]] for human sacrifice, used as territorial markers, or elements of a complex ideological system, or functioned as early calendars.&lt;ref&gt;Patton, Mark. "Statements in Stone: Monuments and Society in Neolithic Brittany". (New York), Routledge, 1993. P. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Until the nineteenth century, antiquarians did not have substantial knowledge of prehistory, and their only reference points were provided by classical literature. The developments of [[radiocarbon dating]] and [[dendrochronology]] have significantly advanced scientific knowledge in this area.

The word ''menhir'' was adopted from French by 19th-century archaeologists. The introduction of the word into general archaeological usage has been attributed to the 18th-century French military officer [[Théophile Corret de la Tour d'Auvergne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.landrucimetieres.fr/spip/spip.php?article1598|title=LA TOUR D’AUVERGNE (Théophile Malo Corret de la Tour d’Auvergne : 1743-1800)|last=Landru|first=Philippe|date=2008-08-23|accessdate=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a combination of two words of the Breton language: ''maen'' and ''hir''. In [[Welsh language|modern Welsh]], they are described as ''maen hir'', or "long stone". In modern Breton, the word ''peulvan'' is used, with ''peul'' meaning "stake" or "post" and ''van'' which is a [[Breton mutations|soft mutation]] of the word ''maen'' which means "stone".

==History==
[[File:Carnac Geant du Manio.jpg|left|thumb|160px|right|The Géant du Manio, a menhir in [[Carnac stones|Carnac]], Brittany]]
Almost nothing is known of the social organization or religious beliefs of the people who erected the menhirs. There is not even any trace of these people's language; however we do know that they buried their dead and had the skills to grow cereal, farm and make pottery, stone tools and jewelry. Identifying their uses remains speculative. Until recently, menhirs were associated with the [[Beaker people]], who inhabited Europe during the European late [[Neolithic]] and early [[Bronze Age]]—later third millennium BC, c. 2800–1800 BC. However, recent research into the age of megaliths in Brittany strongly suggests a far older origin, perhaps back to six to seven thousand years ago.&lt;ref name="MM"&gt;Aviva, Elyn; White, Gary. "Mysterious Megaliths: The Standing Stones of Carnac, Brittany, France". ''World and I'', Vol. 13, October 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many menhirs are engraved with [[megalithic art]]. This often turned them into [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] [[Stele|stelae]], although images of objects such as [[stone axe]]s, ploughs, shepherd crooks and yokes were common. With the exception of the stone axe, none of these motifs are definite, and the name used to describe them is largely for convenience. Some menhirs were broken up and incorporated into later [[passage graves]], where they had new megalithic art carved with little regard for the previous pictures. It is not known if this re-use was deliberate or if the passage grave builders just saw menhirs as a convenient source of stone (Le Roux 1992).

During the Middle Ages, standing stones were believed to have been built by the [[Giant (mythology)|giants]] who lived before the [[biblical flood]]. Many of the [[megalith]]s were destroyed or defaced by early Christians, but it is estimated that some 50,000 megaliths once stood in Northern Europe, where almost 10,000 now remain.&lt;ref name="Olsen"&gt;{{cite book|last=Olsen|first=Brad|title=Sacred Places Around the World: 108 Destinations By Brad Olsen|publisher=Consortium of Collective Consciousness|date=February 2004|page=232|chapter=Carbnac|isbn=1-888729-10-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7FS40w2nrqQC&amp;pg=PA232&amp;lpg=PA232&amp;dq=menhirs+destroyed+by+christians&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=L-ponvdd9t&amp;sig=107ZjS_TMGCHxzcqNOcA6B6sNGA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Gp2AS4jIFZHu0gSj4aWzBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=menhirs%20destroyed%20by%20christians&amp;f=false|accessdate=21 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mind Ripper''''', also known as '''''The Hills Have Eyes III''''', '''''The Hills Still Have Eyes''''', or '''''The Outpost''''', is a horror film released on [[HBO]] in 1995. It stars [[Lance Henriksen]] and [[Giovanni Ribisi]].

Although it is marketed in some areas as a sequel to the original ''[[The Hills Have Eyes (1977 film)|The Hills Have Eyes]]'' and ''[[The Hills Have Eyes Part II]]'', no actors, characters, or scenarios link it to those films. Its only connection is producer [[Wes Craven]], who wrote and directed the other two films. His son, [[Jonathan Craven]], is credited as a writer.

==Plot==
Set in a remote desert location, government scientists perform [[Corporeal reanimation|reanimation]] experiments in an underground nuclear facility. The goal is to create a [[superhuman]]. Their first subject, "Thor", is a specimen from a suicide found in the desert. In the attempts to bring Thor back, an uncontrollable creature is unleashed. The next morning, a scientist named Alex calls Stockton, one of the overseers of the project, at his home and after an argument, Stockton eventually decides to visit the facility by plane. His son Scott, his daughter Wendy, and Wendy's boyfriend Mark join him.

The term "MEI", like "TEI", describes the governing organization and the markup language. The MEI community solicits input and development directions from specialists in various music research communities, including technologists, librarians, historians, and theorists in a common effort to discuss and define best practices for representing a broad range of musical documents and structures. The results of these discussions are then formalized into the MEI schema, a core set of rules for recording physical and intellectual characteristics of music notation documents. This schema is expressed in an [[XML Schema]] Language, with [[RelaxNG]] being the preferred format.  The MEI schema is developed using the One-Document-Does-it-all (ODD) format, a [[literate programming]] XML format developed by the Text Encoding Initiative.

==History==
The New Mexico True tourism $2 million campaign by the New Mexico Tourism Department.&lt;ref name="Blevins 2012"/&gt; Though the campaign has been well received, it has been criticized. The first set of criticism was due to the Tourism Department's use of a non-New Mexican advertising agency to create the campaign, Vendor Inc. from [[Austin, Texas]].&lt;ref name="Castellanos 2012"&gt;{{cite web|last=Castellanos|first=Dalina|title=New Mexico centennial: Call for|website=Los Angeles Times Articles|date=March 22, 2012|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/mar/22/nation/la-na-nn-new-mexico-causes-stir-with-centennial-marketing-campaign-20120322|accessdate=October 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though, when Vendor performed surveys on "samplings of travelers", they found the state's basic misunderstandings began at a fundamental level; with the results of the survey being, "'boring;', a 'desert wasteland' where 'there is not a lot to do'; 'artsy' — which is appealing 'you know for an hour'; 'is the lost state' that many travelers drive through to get to neighboring states; does not offer skiing but does have 'beaches'; and apparently includes El Paso."&lt;ref name="Albuquerque Journal News 2012"&gt;{{cite web|title=New Tourism Ads Show ‘True’ N.M.|website=Albuquerque Journal News|date=April 17, 2012|url=http://www.abqjournal.com/100488/news/new-tourism-ads-show-true-nm.html|accessdate=October 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was from this research that one of the campaigns goals of "combating the negative perceptions about New Mexico" derives.

'''Nazism and occultism''' describes a range of theories, speculation and research into the origins of [[Nazism]] and its possible relation to various [[occult]] traditions. Such ideas have been a part of [[popular culture]] since at least the early 1940s, and gained renewed popularity starting in the 1960s. There are documentaries and books on the topic, among the most significant are ''[[The Morning of the Magicians]]'' (1960) and ''[[Holy Lance#Trevor Ravenscroft|The Spear of Destiny]]'' (1972). Nazism and occultism has also been featured in numerous films, novels, comic books and other fictional media. A prominent example is the film ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' (1981).

Historian [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]] analyzed the topic in ''[[The Occult Roots of Nazism]]'' in which he argued there were in fact links between some ideals of [[Ariosophy]] and Nazi ideology. He also analyzed the problems of the numerous popular occult historiography books written on the topic. He sought to separate [[empiricism]] and [[sociology]] from the modern mythology of Nazi occultism that exists in many books which "have represented the Nazi phenomenon as the product of arcane and demonic influence". He considered most of these to be "sensational and under-researched".&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 218–225&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ariosophy==
Historian [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]]'s 1985 book, ''[[The Occult Roots of Nazism]]'', discussed the possibility of links between the ideas of the [[Occult]] and those of Nazism. The book's main subject was the racist-occult movement of [[Ariosophy]], a major strand of Nationalist [[Esotericism in Germany and Austria]] during the 1800s and early 1900s. He described his work as "an underground history, concerned with the myths, symbols, and fantasies that bear on the development of reactionary, authoritarian, and Nazi styles of thinking". He focused on this unexamined topic of history because "fantasies can achieve a causal status once they have been institutionalized in beliefs, values, and social groups."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''[[The Occult Roots of Nazism]]'', Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt;

He describes the [[Völkisch movement]] as a sort of anti-modernist, anti-liberal reaction to the many political, social, and economic changes occurring in Germanic Europe in the late 1800s. Part of his argument is that the rapid [[industrialization]] and rise of cities changed the "traditional, rural social order" and ran into conflict with the "pre-capitalist attitudes and institutions" of the area. He described the racially elitist [[Pan-Germanism]] movement of [[ethnic German]] Austrians as a reaction to Austria not being included in the [[German Empire]] of Bismarck.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Goodrick-Clarke opined that the Ariosophist movement took Völkisch ideas but added occultish themes about things like Freemasonry, Kabbalism, and Rosicrucianism in order to "prove the modern world was based on false and evil principles". The Ariosophist "ideas and symbols filtered through to several anti-semitic and Nationalist groups in late Wilhelmian Germany, from which the early Nazi Party emerged in Munich after the First World War." He showed some links between two Ariosophists and [[Heinrich Himmler]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Modern mythology==
&lt;blockquote&gt;There is a persistent idea, widely canvassed in a sensational genre of literature, that the Nazis were principally inspired and directed by occult agencies from 1920 to 1945.&lt;ref name="Goodrick-Clarke 1985, 217"&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 217.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Appendix E of Goodrick-Clarke's book is entitled ''The Modern Mythology of Nazi Occultism''. In it, he gives a highly critical view of much of the popular literature on the topic. In his words, these books describe Hitler and the Nazis as being controlled by a "hidden power . . . characterized either as a discarnate entity (e.g., '[[Black magic|black forces]]', '[[Cabal|invisible hierarchies]]', '[[Power behind the throne|unknown superiors]]') or as a magical elite in a remote age or distant location".&lt;ref name="Goodrick-Clarke 1985, 218"/&gt; He referred to the writers of this genre as "[[Pseudohistory|crypto-historians]]".&lt;ref name="Goodrick-Clarke 1985, 218"&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 218.&lt;/ref&gt; The works of the genre, he wrote,
{{quote|were typically sensational and under-researched. A complete ignorance of the primary sources was common to most authors and inaccuracies and wild claims were repeated by each newcomer to the genre until an abundant literature existed, based on wholly spurious 'facts' concerning the powerful Thule Society, the Nazi links with the East, and Hitler's occult initiation.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 224,225&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a new preface for the 2004 edition of ''The Occult Roots...'' Goodrick-Clarke comments that in 1985, when his book first appeared, "Nazi 'black magic' was regarded as a topic for sensational authors in pursuit of strong sales."&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 2004: vi.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2002 work ''[[Black Sun (Goodrick-Clarke book)|Black Sun]]'', which was originally intended to trace the survival of occult Nazi themes in the postwar period,&lt;ref name="GC02-6"&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 2002: 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Goodrick-Clarke considered it necessary to readdress the topic. He devotes one chapter of the book to "the Nazi mysteries",&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 2002: 107–128.&lt;/ref&gt; as he terms the field of Nazi occultism there. Other reliable summaries of the development of the genre have been written by German historians. The German edition of ''The Occult Roots...'' includes an essay "Nationalsozialismus und Okkultismus" ("National Socialism and Occultism"), which traces the origins of the speculation about Nazi occultism back to publications from the late 1930s, and which was subsequently translated by Goodrick-Clarke into English. The German historian [[Michael Rißmann]] has also included a longer "excursus" about "Nationalsozialismus und Okkultismus" in his acclaimed book on [[Adolf Hitler's religious beliefs]].&lt;ref&gt;Rißmann 2001: 137–172.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Goodricke-Clarke the speculation of Nazi occultism originated from "post-war fascination with Nazism".&lt;ref name="Goodrick-Clarke 1985, 217"/&gt; The "horrid fascination" of Nazism upon the Western mind&lt;ref name="GC02-107"&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 2002: 107.&lt;/ref&gt; emerges from the "uncanny interlude in modern history" that it presents to an observer a few decades later.&lt;ref name="Goodrick-Clarke 1985, 217"/&gt; The idolization of Hitler in Nazi Germany, its short lived dominion on the European continent and Nazism's extreme [[antisemitism]] set it apart from other periods of modern history.&lt;ref name="GC02-107"/&gt; "Outside a purely secular frame of reference, Nazism was felt to be the embodiment of evil in a modern twentieth-century regime, a monstrous pagan relapse in the Christian community of Europe."&lt;ref name="GC02-107"/&gt;

By the early 1960s, "one could now clearly detect a mystique of Nazism."&lt;ref name="GC02-107"/&gt; A sensationalistic and fanciful presentation of its figures and symbols, shorn of all political and historical contexts", gained ground with thrillers, non-fiction books and films and permeated "the milieu of [[popular culture]]."&lt;ref name="GC02-107"/&gt;

===Historiography concerning ''The Occult Roots of Nazism''===
''The Occult Roots of Nazism'' is commended for specifically addressing the fanciful modern depictions of Nazi occultism, as well as carefully reflecting critical scholarly work that finds associations between Ariosophy with Nazi agency. As scholar [[Anna Bramwell]] writes, "One should not be deceived by the title into thinking that it belongs to the 'modern mythology of Nazi occultism', a world of salacious fantasy convincingly dismembered by the author in an Appendix," &lt;ref name="Bramwell, Anna 1988"&gt;Bramwell, Anna. 1988. "Review". The English Historical Review 103 (407). 156.&lt;/ref&gt; referring the various written, depicted, and produced material that delves into Nazi occultism without providing any reliable or relevant evidence. Instead, it is through Goodrick-Clarke's work that several scholarly criticisms addressing occult relevance in conjunction with Ariosophist practices arise.

Historians like [[Martyn Housden]] and [[Jeremy Noakes]] commend Goodrick-Clarke for addressing the relationship between Ariosophic ideologies rooted in certain Germanic cultures and the actual agency of Nazi hierarchy; the problem, as Housden remarks, lies in the efficacy of these Ariosophic practices. As he remarks, "The true value of this study, therefore, lies in its painstaking elucidation of an intrinsically fascinating subculture which helped colour rather than cause aspects of Nazism. In this context, it also leaves us pondering a central issue: why on earth were Austrian and German occultists, just like the Nazi leadership, quite so susceptible to, indeed obsessed by, specifically aggressive racist beliefs anyway?"&lt;ref&gt;Housden, Martyn. 1994. "Review". History 79 (255). 179.&lt;/ref&gt; Noakes continues this general thought by concluding, "(Goodrick-Clarke) provides not only a definitive account of the influence of Ariosophy on Nazism, a subject which is prone to sensationalism, but also fascinating insights into the intellectual climate of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century."&lt;ref&gt;Noakes, Jeremy. 1988. "Review". History 73 (238).364.&lt;/ref&gt; These reviews reflect the greatest dilemmas in Nazi occultist scholarship; the discernment between actual efficacy of possible Occult practices by Nazi leaders, purpose of these practices, and modern notions and applications of Occultism today largely impact the appropriate scholarship in general in making connections between plausible Nazi Ariosophic practices and blatant popular myth.&lt;ref name="Bramwell, Anna 1988"/&gt;

The linkages Goodrick-Clarke makes concerning Ariosophy and German society are further detailed in [[Peter Merkl]]'s ''Political Violence under the Swastika'', "pre-1933 Nazis", various NSDAP members, volunteered to write their memoirs and recollections about the rise of the Nazi Party in order to provide a coherent, statistical analysis of the motivations and ideals these early members hoped to pursue in German politics. From the findings, Merkl has found, through statistical evidence, that there were aspects of ideology within German society that favored intense German nationalism, ranging from what was considered to be a "German Romantic", one who was "beholden to the cultural and historical traditions of old Germany…"&lt;ref&gt;Peter H. Merkl. 1975. Political Violence Under The Swastika: 581 Early Nazis. Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press. 453.&lt;/ref&gt; to someone classified as a part of an alleged "Nordic/Hitler Cult", one who followed [[Voelkisch]] (traditional, anti-Semitic) beliefs. To further prove the point, Merkl discovered that of those willing to submit their testimonies, "Protestants tended to be German Romantics, Catholics to be anti-Semites, superpatriots, and solidarists. Areas of religious homogeneity were particularly high in anti-Semitism or in the Nordic-German cult,"&lt;ref&gt;Peter H. Merkl. 1975. Political Violence Under The Swastika: 581 Early Nazis. Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press. 687.&lt;/ref&gt; of which members of both religious groups were prone to [[Judenkoller]], an alleged sudden and violent sickness that would manifest either in blatant hatred or hysteria at being within proximity of Jewish persons. Coincidentally, Merkl mentions a relationship to this Nordic/German- agrarian cult in relation to 19th-century to a "crypto-Nazi tradition", despite being written ten years prior to ''The Occult Roots of Nazism''.

Some of this modern mythology even touches Goodrick-Clarke's topic directly. The rumor that Adolf Hitler had encountered the Austrian monk and anti-semitic publicist, [[Lanz von Liebenfels]], already at the age of 8, at Heilgenkreuz abbey, goes back to ''Les mystiques du soleil'' (1971) by Michel-Jean Angbert. "This episode is wholly imaginary."&lt;ref name="Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 224"&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 224.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, Michel-Jean Angbert and the other authors discussed by Goodrick-Clarke present their accounts as real, so that this modern mythology has led to several legends that resemble [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]], concerning, for example, the [[Vril|Vril Society]] or rumours about [[Karl Haushofer]]'s connection to the occult. The most influential books were [[The Spear of Destiny (Ravenscroft)|Trevor Ravenscroft's ''The Spear of Destiny'']] and ''[[The Morning of the Magicians]]'' by Pauwels and Bergier.

===Claims===
One of the earliest claims of Nazi occultism can be found in [[Lewis Spence]]'s book ''Occult Causes of the Present War'' (1940). According to Spence, [[Alfred Rosenberg]] and his book ''[[The Myth of the Twentieth Century]]'' were responsible for promoting pagan, occult and anti-Christian ideas that motivated the Nazi party.

====Demonic possession of Hitler====
For a [[demon]]ic influence on Hitler, [[Hermann Rauschning]]'s ''Hitler Speaks'' is brought forward as source.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plim.org/demonleaders.htm Demonic Possession of World Leaders] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927063944/http://www.plim.org/demonleaders.htm |date=2006-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most modern scholars do not consider Rauschning reliable.&lt;ref&gt;Theodor Schieder (1972), ''Hermann Rauschnings "Gespräche mit Hitler" als Geschichtsquelle'' (Oppladen, Germany: Westdeutscher Verlag) and Wolfgang Hänel (1984), ''Hermann Rauschnings "Gespräche mit Hitler": Eine Geschichtsfälschung'' (Ingolstadt, Germany: Zeitgeschichtliche Forschungsstelle), cit. in Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke (2003), ''Black Sun'', p. 321.&lt;/ref&gt; (As Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke summarises, "recent scholarship has almost certainly proved that Rauschning's conversations were mostly invented".)&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke (2003: 110). The best that can be said for Rauschning's claims may be Goodrick-Clarke's judgment that they "record ... the authentic voice of Hitler by inspired guesswork and imagination" (''ibid.'').&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly to Rauschning, [[August Kubizek]], one of Hitler's closest friends since childhood, claims that Hitler—17 years old at the time—once spoke to him of "returning Germany to its former glory"; of this comment August said, "It was as if another being spoke out of his body, and moved him as much as it did me."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetrumpet.com/index.php?page=book&amp;q=1194.6.0.4 “Hitler and the Holy Roman Empire”] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927213128/http://www.thetrumpet.com/index.php?page=book&amp;q=1194.6.0.4 |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An article "Hitler's Forgotten Library" by Timothy Ryback, published in ''[[The Atlantic]]'' (May 2003),&lt;ref&gt;Ryback, Timothy W. [https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200305/ryback "Hitler's Forgotten Library"]. ''[[The Atlantic]]'', May 2003. Accessed 27 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; mentions a book from [[Hitler's private library]] authored by [[Ernst Schertel]]. Schertel, whose interests were [[flagellation]], dance, occultism, [[nudism]] and [[BDSM]], had also been active as an activist for [[Sexual revolution|sexual liberation]] before 1933. He had been imprisoned in Nazi Germany for seven months and his doctoral degree was revoked. He is supposed to have sent a dedicated copy of his 1923 book ''[[Magic: History, Theory and Practice]]'' to Hitler some time in the mid-1920s. Hitler is said to have marked extensive passages, including one which reads "He who does not have the demonic seed within himself will never give birth to a magical world".&lt;ref&gt;Kelley, JH. [http://www.prlog.org/10238075-new-translation-of-german-book-links-hitler-to-satanism.html "New Translation of German Book Links Hitler to Satanism"] (press release). PRLog, May 17, 2009. Accessed 28 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophist]] [[Alice A. Bailey]] stated during [[World War II]] that Adolf Hitler was possessed by what she called the ''Dark Forces''.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''The Externalisation of the Hierarchy'' New York:1957 (Compilation of earlier revelations by Alice A. Bailey) Lucis Publishing Co. Page 425&lt;/ref&gt; Her follower [[Benjamin Creme]] has stated that through Hitler (and a group of equally evil men around him in Nazi Germany, together with a group of militarists in Japan and a further group around Mussolini in Italy&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''The Externalisation of the Hierarchy'' New York:1957 (Compilation of earlier revelations by Alice A. Bailey) Lucis Publishing Co. Page 258&lt;/ref&gt;) was released the energies of the [[Antichrist]],&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''[[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]]'s Mission – Volume III'' Amsterdam:1997 Share International Foundation Page 416&lt;/ref&gt; which, according to theosophical teachings is not an individual person but forces of destruction.

According to [[James Herbert Brennan]] in his book ''[[Occult Reich]]'', Hitler's mentor, [[Dietrich Eckhart]] (to whom Hitler dedicates ''[[Mein Kampf]]''), wrote to a friend of his in 1923: "Follow Hitler! He will dance, but it is I who have called the tune. We have given him the 'means of communication' with Them. Do not mourn for me; I shall have influenced history more than any other German."

====New World Order====
Conspiracy theorists "frequently identify German National Socialism [[inter alia]] as a precursor of the New World Order".&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 2002: 288.&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to Hitler's later ambition of imposing a National Socialist regime throughout Europe, [[Propaganda in Nazi Germany|Nazi propaganda]] used the term ''Neuordnung'' (often poorly translated as "the [[New Order (Nazism)|New Order"]], while actually referring to the "re-structurization" of state borders on the European map and the resulting post-war economic hegemony of Greater Germany),&lt;ref&gt;Safire, William. [https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/17/magazine/on-language-the-new-new-world-order.html "On Language; The New, New World Order"]. ''[[The New York Times]]'', February 17, 1991. Accessed 27 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; so one could probably say that the Nazis pursued [[New world order (politics)|a new world order]] in terms of politics. But the claim that Hitler and the [[Thule Society]] conspired to create a [[New World Order (conspiracy theory)|New World Order]] (a conspiracy theory, put forward on some webpages)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newswatchmagazine.org/weekly_editor/9.22.00.htm Historic Results of Hitler's Thule Societies pursuit of the NWO] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070207074923/http://www.newswatchmagazine.org/weekly_editor/9.22.00.htm |date=2007-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is completely unfounded.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 201; Johannes Hering, ''Beiträge zur Geschichte der Thule-Gesellschaft'', typescript dated June 21, 1939, [[Bundesarchiv]], Koblenz, NS26/865.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aleister Crowley====
There are also unverifiable rumours that the occultist [[Aleister Crowley]] sought to contact Hitler during World War II. Despite several allegations and speculations to the contrary (e.g. [[Giorgio Galli]]) there is no evidence of such an encounter.&lt;ref name=Hakl205&gt;Hakl 1997: 205.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, [[John Symonds]], one of Crowley's [[literary executor]]s published a book: ''The Medusa's Head or Conversations between Aleister Crowley and Adolf Hitler'', which has definitively been shown to be literary fiction.&lt;ref name=Hakl205/&gt; That the edition of this book was limited to 350 also contributed to the mystery surrounding the topic.&lt;ref name=Hakl205/&gt; Mention of a contact between Crowley and Hitler—without any sources or evidence—is also made in a letter from [[René Guénon]] to [[Julius Evola]] dated October 29, 1949, which later reached a broader audience.&lt;ref name=Hakl205/&gt;

====Erik Jan Hanussen====
When ''[[Hitler and the Occult]]'' describes how Hitler "seemed endowed with even greater authority and charisma" after he had resumed public speaking in March 1927, the documentary states that "this may have been due to the influence" of the clairvoyant performer and publicist, [[Erik Jan Hanussen]]. It is said that "Hanussen helped Hitler perfect a series of exaggerated poses," useful for speaking before a huge audience. The documentary then interviews [[Dusty Sklar]] about the contact between Hitler and Hanussen, and the narrator makes the statement about "occult techniques of mind control and crowd domination".

Whether Hitler had met Hanussen at all is not certain. That he even encountered him before March 1927 is not confirmed by other sources about Hanussen. In the late 1920s to early 1930s Hanussen made political predictions in his own newspaper, ''Hanussens Bunte Wochenschau'', that gradually started to favour Hitler, but until late 1932 these predictions varied.&lt;ref name="Frei-85"&gt;Frei 1980: 85.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929, Hanussen predicted, for example, that [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] would return to Germany in 1930 and that the problem of unemployment would be solved in 1931.&lt;ref name="Frei-85"/&gt;

====Winston Churchill====
Sir [[Winston Churchill]] wrote in his memoir "The Gathering Storm" about Hitler and [[Moloch]]: "[Hitler] had conjured up the fearful idol of an all-devouring Moloch of which he was the priest and incarnation".&lt;ref&gt;Churchill, Winston S. ''The Gathering Storm: The Second World War, Volume 1'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=Daxn4IOTqC4C&amp;pg=PA64] Page 64&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nazi mysticism, occultism and science fiction====
Nazi mysticism in German culture is further expanded upon within [[Manfred Nagl]]'s article "SF (Science Fiction), Occult Sciences, and Nazi Myths", published in the journal ''[[Science Fiction Studies]]''. In it, Nagl writes that the racial narratives described in contemporary German Science Fiction stories, like The Last Queen of Atlantis, by Edmund Kiss, provide further notions of racial superiority under the auspices of Ariosophy, Aryanism, and alleged historic racial Mysticism, suggesting that writings associated with possible Occultism, Ariosophy, or Aryanism were products intended to influence and justify in a socio-political manner, rather than simply establish cultural heritage. The stories themselves dealt with "...heroes, charismatic leader types, (who) have been chosen by fate – with the resources of a sophisticated and extremely powerful technology"."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Nagl, Manfred. "SF, Occult Sciences, and Nazi Myths". Science Fiction Studies. 1 (3): 190.&lt;/ref&gt; Nagl considers science fiction pieces like Atlantis further fueled the violent persuasiveness of Nazi leaders, such as Adolf Hitler and Heinrich Himmler, as further justification for a "Nazi elite (envisioning) for itself in occupied East European territories".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; This, in turn, allegedly propagated public support of Nazi ideology, summated by Nagl as "a tremendous turning back of culture, away from the age of reason and consciousness, toward the age of a 'sleepwalking certainty', the age of supra-rational magic".&lt;ref&gt;Nagl, Manfred. "SF, Occult Sciences, and Nazi Myths". Science Fiction Studies 1 (3): 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crypto-historic books===
In the essay that is included in the German edition of ''The Occult Roots...'', H. T. Hakl, an Austrian publisher of esoteric works,&lt;ref&gt;[http://d-nb.info/gnd/123134625 Entry for Hans Thomas Hakl] from the [[German National Library]].&lt;/ref&gt; traces the origins of the speculation about National Socialism and Occultism back to several works from the early 1940s. His research was also published in a short book, ''Unknown sources: National Socialism and the Occult'', translated by Goodrick-Clarke. Already in 1933 a pseudonymous ''Kurt van Emsen'' described Hitler as a "demonic personality", but his work was soon forgotten.&lt;ref&gt;Hakl 1997: 209.&lt;/ref&gt; The first allusions that Hitler was directed by occult forces which were taken up by the later authors came from French [[Esoteric Christianity|Christian esotericist]] René Kopp.&lt;ref name="hakl97-210"&gt;Hakl 1997: 210.&lt;/ref&gt; In two articles published in the monthly esoteric journal ''Le Chariot'' from June 1934 and April 1939, he seeks to trace the source of Hitler's power to supernatural forces.&lt;ref name="hakl97-210"/&gt; The second article was titled: "''L'Enigme du Hitler''".&lt;ref name="hakl97-210"/&gt; In other French esoteric journals of the 1930s, Hakl could not find similar hints.&lt;ref name="hakl97-210"/&gt; In 1939 another French author, Edouard Saby, published a book: ''Hitler et les Forces Occultes''.&lt;ref name="hakl97-212"&gt;Hakl 1997: 212.&lt;/ref&gt; Saby already mentions Hanussen and [[Ignaz Trebitsch-Lincoln]].&lt;ref name="hakl97-214"&gt;Hakl 1997: 214.&lt;/ref&gt; Hakl even hints that Edouard Saby would have the copyright on the myth of Nazi occultism.&lt;ref name="hakl97-214"/&gt; However, another significant book from 1939 is better known: [[Hermann Rauschning]]'s ''Hitler Speaks''. There it is said (in the chapter "Black and White Magic"), that "Hitler surrendered himself to forces that carried him away. (...) He turned himself over to a spell, which can, with good reason and not simply in a figurative analogy, be described as demonic magic." &lt;!--translated from German, if you have a quote from an English edition, please correct!--&gt; The chapter "Hitler in private" is even more dramatic, and was left out in the German edition from 1940.&lt;ref name="hakl97-211"&gt;Hakl 1997: 211.&lt;/ref&gt;

Goodrick-Clarke examines several pseudo-historic "books written about Nazi occultism between 1960 and 1975", that "were typically sensational and under-researched".&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 224, 225.&lt;/ref&gt; He terms this genre "crypto-history", as its defining element and "final point of explanatory reference is an agent which has remained concealed to previous historians of National Socialism".&lt;ref name="Goodrick-Clarke 1985, 218"/&gt; Characteristic tendencies of this literature include: (1) "a complete ignorance of primary sources" and (2) the repetition of "inaccuracies and wild claims", without the attempt being made to confirm even "wholly spurious 'facts'".&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 225.&lt;/ref&gt; Books debunked in Appendix E of ''[[The Occult Roots of Nazism]]'' are:

* [[Louis Pauwels]] and [[Jacques Bergier]], 1960, ''[[The Morning of the Magicians]]''&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 219–220.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dietrich Bronder, 1964, ''Bevor Hitler kam''&lt;ref name="Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 221"&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 221.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Trevor Ravenscroft, 1972, ''The Spear of Destiny''&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 221–223.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Michel-Jean Angbert, 1971, ''Les mystiques du soleil''&lt;ref name="Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 224"/&gt;
* [[James Herbert Brennan|J. H. Brennan]], 1974, ''[[The Occult Reich]]''&lt;ref name="Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 221"/&gt;
* [[Otto Rahn]], 1937, ''Luzifers Hofgesind, eine Reise zu den guten Geistern Europas'' (Lucifer's Court: A Heretic's Journey in Search of the Light Bringers).

These books are only mentioned in the Appendix. Otherwise the whole book by Goodrick-Clarke does without any reference to this kind of literature; it uses other sources. This literature is not reliable; however, books published after the emergence of ''The Occult Roots of Nazism'' continue to repeat claims that have been proven false:

* Wulf Schwarzwaller, 1988, ''The Unknown Hitler''&lt;ref&gt;If ''The Unknown Hitler'' is quoted correctly in [http://www.conspiracyarchive.com/NWO/Vril_Society.htm The Vril Society, the Luminous Lodge and the Realization of the Great Work], then this book makes false allegations about [[Karl Haushofer]] and [[G. I. Gurdjieff]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Alan Baker, 2000, ''[[Invisible Eagle]]. The History of Nazi Occultism''&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 5 of the [http://plausible.custompublish.com/getfile.php/217726.476.xauysabydy/invisible.eagle_alan.baker.pdf Free online version] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715143102/https://plausible.custompublish.com/getfile.php/217726.476.xauysabydy/invisible.eagle_alan.baker.pdf |date=2007-07-15 }} of ''Invisible Eagle'' is mainly based on Ravenscroft.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Documentaries==
More than 60 years after the end of the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]], National Socialism and Adolf Hitler have become a recurring subject in history [[Documentary film|documentaries]]. Among these documentaries, there are several that focus especially on the potential relations between Nazism and Occultism, such as [[History (U.S. TV channel)|the History Channel]]'s documentary ''[[Hitler and the Occult]]''.&lt;ref&gt;The History Channel online Store: [http://store.aetv.com/html/product/index.jhtml?id=76782 The Unknown Hitler DVD Collection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071106023116/http://store.aetv.com/html/product/index.jhtml?id=76782 |date=2007-11-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Another critique of Hitler documentaries: [http://www1.salon.com/may97/media/media970508.html Mark Schone – All Hitler, all the time] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120129163121/http://www1.salon.com/may97/media/media970508.html |date=2012-01-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As evidence of Hitler's "occult power" this documentary offers, for example, the infamous statement by [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] of his continued subservience to Hitler at the [[Nuremberg Trials]].&lt;ref&gt;"Even with all I know, if in this cell Hitler should come to me and say 'Do this!', I would still do it." – [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]], 1946&lt;/ref&gt; After the author [[Dusty Sklar]] has pointed out that [[Death of Adolf Hitler|Hitler's suicide]] happened at the night of April 30/May 1, which is [[Walpurgis Night]], the narrator continues: "With Hitler gone, it was as if a spell had been broken". A much more plausible reason for Hitler's suicide (that does not involve the paranormal) is that the Russians had already closed to within several hundred meters of [[Führerbunker|Hitler's bunker]] and he did not want to be captured alive.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-04051A, Reichsparteitag, Rede Adolf Hitlers.jpg|thumb|right|Hitler speaking at a huge mass meeting, the [[Nuremberg Rally]] 1934]]
From the perspective of academic history, these documentaries on Nazism, if ever commented, are seen as problematic because they do not contribute to an actual understanding of the problems that arise in the study of Nazism and Neo-Nazism. Without referring to a specific documentary [[Mattias Gardell]], a historian who studies contemporary separatist groups, writes:

{{quote|In documentaries portraying the Third Reich, Hitler is cast as a master magician; these documentaries typically include scenes in which Hitler is speaking at huge mass meetings. [...] Cuts mix Hitler screaming with regiments marching under the sign of the swastika. Instead of providing a translation of his verbal crescendos, the sequence is overlaid with a speaker talking about something different. All this combines to demonize Hitler as an evil wizard spellbinding an unwitting German people to become his zombified servants until they are liberated from the spell by the Allied victory after which, suddenly, there were no German Nazis left among the populace. How convenient it would be if this image were correct. National socialism could be defeated with garlic. Watchdog groups could be replaced with a few vampire killers, and resources being directed into anti-racist community programs could be directed at something else. [...]

The truth, however, is that millions of ordinary German workers, farmers and businessmen supported the national socialist program. [...] They were people who probably considered themselves good citizens, which is far more frightening than had they merely been demons.&lt;ref&gt;Gardell 2003, 331, 332&lt;/ref&gt;}}

&lt;!--If Hitler (and also [[Stalin]]) or the Nazis in general, were the agents of Satan, or "'black forces', 'invisible hierarchies', 'unknown superiors' or any other 'discarnate entity'",&lt;ref name="Goodrick-Clarke 1985, 218"/&gt; this would be a convenient explanation. Explaining [[Hitler's rise to power]], the Second World War and possibly even [[The Holocaust]] by the means of the [[paranormal]] seems to serve the [[Functionalism (sociology)|function]] of protecting the authors and readers alike from having to deal with this [[Rationalist movement|rationally]].--&gt;
''[[Hitler and the Occult]]'' includes a scene in which Hitler is seen as speaking at a huge mass meeting. While Hitler's speech is not translated, the narrator talks about the German occultist and stage [[mentalist]] [[Erik Jan Hanussen]]: "Occultists believe, Hanussen may also have imparted occult techniques of mind control and crowd domination on Hitler" (see below). When historians have noted the existence of such "myths" as those about Erik Jan Hanussen, they have displayed nothing but academic contempt for their originators.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

===Ernst Schäfer's expedition to Tibet===
At least one documentary, ''Hitler's Search for the Holy Grail,'' includes footage from the [[1939 German expedition to Tibet]]. The documentary describes it as "the most ambitious expedition" of the SS. This original video material was made accessible again by Marco Dolcetta in his series ''Il Nazismo Esoterico'' in 1994.&lt;ref name="Hakl-204"&gt;Hakl 1997: 204&lt;/ref&gt; An interview that Dolcetta conducted with Schäfer does not support the theories of Nazi occultism, neither does Reinhard Greve's 1995 article ''Tibetforschung im SS Ahnenerbe'' (''Tibet Research Within the SS Ahnenerbe''),&lt;ref&gt;Reinhard Greve: ''Tibetforschung im SS Ahnenerbe''; in: Thomas Hauschild: ''Lebenslust durch Fremdenfurcht'', Frankfurt (Main), 1995, pp. 168–209.&lt;/ref&gt; although the latter does mention the occult thesis.&lt;ref name="Hakl-204"/&gt; Hakl comments that Greve should have emphasized the unreliability of authors like Bergier and Pauwels or Angbert more.&lt;ref name="Hakl-204"/&gt; [[Ernst Schäfer]]'s expedition report explicitly remarks on the "worthless goings-on" &lt;!--wertloses Treiben--&gt;  by "a whole army of quacksalvers" concerning Asia and especially Tibet.&lt;ref name="Hakl-204"/&gt;

==In popular culture==
{{multiple issues|section=y|{{in popular culture|section|date=November 2016}}
{{refimprove section|date=October 2013}}}}
The image of a connection between Nazism and the occult is a common theme in [[fantasy fiction]]. One could also ask whether ''[[The Morning of the Magicians]]'' should not be considered as fiction, since the authors fail to clearly state that it was supposed to be fact. Aside from such considerations, there are also many accounts of Nazi occultism that are clearly fictional.

===Literature===
* [[Dennis Wheatley]]'s novel ''[[They Used Dark Forces]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.denniswheatley.info/firsteditions08.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
* Occult-obsessed Nazis have long been a staple of [[superhero]] [[comic book]]s:
** Neo-Nazis are recurring villains in ''[[Warrior Nun Areala]]'', most notably [[Characters in Warrior Nun Areala#The Nazis|Dr. Frederick Ottoman]], a mad scientist with fleets of Nazi-UFOs and spies in every government.
** In the 1980s, [[DC Comics]] writer [[Roy Thomas]] invented a [[retcon]] to explain why [[Superman]], the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]], and the [[Justice Society of America]] had been unable to defeat the Nazis: Hitler possessed the [[Spear of Destiny|Spear of Destiny (Spear of Longinus)]] which gave him magical control over any superheroes who ventured into his territory. Later appearances of the Spear in DC continuity also suggested that it was the [[Gungnir]], the spear wielded by [[Odin]] in Norse mythology.
** In the [[Marvel Comics]] comic book series ''[[Invaders (comics)|The Invaders]]'', [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] was summoned by Hitler to battle that superhero group; however, Thor soon realized he was being used, and returned to [[Asgard]].
** The Thule Society appears in [[Steve Gerber]]'s brief run on ''[[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak and Dagger]]''.
** The [[Hellboy]] comic books and movies also portray the Nazis and the [[Thule Society]] as powerful occult figures; in that universe, Hitler lived until 1958 and waged a "secret war" from [[South America]] after the collapse of the Third Reich.
** [[David Brin]]'s [[Novella|novelette]] "[[Thor Meets Captain America]]" and [[graphic novel]] ''[[The Life Eaters]]'' center on this theme, as well.
** The [[Danger Girl]] comic book features as its villains a modern-day Nazi group called 'The Hammer', which intends to use occult artifacts from [[Atlantis]] to establish a Fourth Reich.
** The [[Zenith (comics)|Zenith]] series, which appeared in the British science fiction comic ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'' heavily features Nazi mysticism as the earthly conduit of extra-dimensional entities that threaten to destroy the universe.
* [[James Herbert]]'s novel, [[The Spear]], deals with a neo-Nazi cult in Britain and an international conspiracy which includes a right-wing US general and a sinister arms dealer, and their obsession with and through the occult with resurrecting Himmler.
* [[Katherine Kurtz]]'s novel ''[[Lammas Night]]'' presents Nazis as powerful magicians who must be opposed by British [[witches]].
* The villains of [[Clive Cussler]]'s novel ''[[Atlantis Found]]'' are modern Nazis who operate out of a secret base in Antarctica and are linked to the ancient culture of [[Atlantis]].
* The Island of [[Thule]] is an important location in the [[Silver Age Sentinels]] [[superhero]] [[role playing game]] and collections of short stories based upon the game. It was raised from the Atlantic Ocean by Kreuzritter ("Crusader"), a Nazi superhuman who wears a mystical suit of armor made by a long-disappeared Aryan culture.
* [[Kouta Hirano|Kouta Hirano's]] [[manga]] series ''[[Hellsing]]'' features [[Millennium (Hellsing)|Millennium]], a group of Nazis with the purpose of creating a [[reich]] that will last a thousand years (in accordance with Hitler's vision). This organization is heavily mystical, including among its number a [[werewolf]], a [[catgirl|catboy]], and an army of 1,000 [[vampire]]s known as the ''Letztes Bataillon'' ("Last Battalion"). It is led by a former [[SS]] officer whose true intention is the pursuit of [[absolute war]].

===Games===
* The [[computer game]] ''[[Return to Castle Wolfenstein]]'' featured a plotline involving Nazi obsession with the occult. It portrays an organization (SS Paranormal Division) based on the Ahnenerbe practicing occult rituals and magic. The game drew themes of Nazi mysticism, among other things, from its predecessors, ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'' and its prequel, ''[[Spear of Destiny (computer game)|Spear of Destiny]]'', the latter of which also featured a storyline concerning Nazi mysticism. ''[[Wolfenstein (series)|Wolfenstein]]'', for example, features a number of inspirations from the real-world Nazi regime but departs from historical reality in a number of ways. For example, the game aggrandizes the [[Kreisau Circle]] to be "an extensive resistance network of paramilitary fighters and informants that aides and abets B.J. [the protagonist] in his exploits," depicts the [[Thule Society]] (that Hitler formally disavowed while in power) as a "powerful nest of high-ranking Nazi officials within the Third Reich who are heavily involved in, and in some cases personally lead, the Reich's paranormal research efforts," and goes beyond Himmler's symbolic use of the [[Black Sun (occult symbol)|Black Sun]] to make it a "limitless energy source that the Nazis are hell-bent on manipulating toward their own nefarious ends."&lt;ref&gt;"Real-life Insanity: ''Wolfenstein's'' events are fictional, but are inspired by the reality of the Nazi regime," ''Game Informer'' 184 (August 2008): 36.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[video game]] ''[[BloodRayne]]'' involves a plotline concerning the Thule society and its members and features a lot of in-game Thule society imagery (especially the character High Priest Von Blut).
* A fictional division of the [[Ahnenerbe]], the Karotechia, has a prominent place in the mythology of the [[Delta Green]] setting for the [[role playing game|role-playing game]] ''[[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|Call of Cthulhu]]'', and stories based upon the setting. In it, the survivors of the Karotechia, a group founded to study occult tomes and conduct magical research, live on in South America, training sorcerers, and cultists to found the Fourth Reich, all under the sway of Hitler's ghost (actually [[Nyarlathotep]] in disguise).
* The [[role playing game]] [[Hollow Earth Expedition]] features a fictionalized [[Thule Society]]'s attempts at infiltrating the [[Hollow Earth]].  The sourcebook, Secrets of the Surface World, further expands the efforts of Nazis to discover and use occult relics.
* The [[action game]] ''[[Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb]]'' revolves around a fictional Chinese artifact called the "Heart of the Dragon" which grants the wielder immense power. A large number of the opponents encountered by the protagonist, [[Indiana Jones]], works for the Nazi commander Albrecht Von Beck who intends to bring the artifact to Hitler.

* In the game ''[[Uncharted: Drake's Fortune]]'' the main character [[Nathan Drake (character)|Nathan Drake]] comes across a derelict, long-abandoned Nazi [[U-Boat]] stranded on rocks below a waterfall in the jungles of Central America. On it, he finds that the crew are dead and mutilated as well as a map to a mysterious island where the statue of [[El Dorado]] was taken to by the [[Spanish Conquistadors]]. Near the end of the game, Nathan finds himself in an abandoned German U-Boat base built into the island in which he finds that the Germans had sought to unlock the power of the statue of El Dorado but learned too late that it carried a curse that had mutated them into monsters.

      <comment>Adding more of the largest open access-only publishers, particularly to include more than only those based in the developed world (i.e. Hindawi, which was founded in Egypt, and MDPI, which has editorial offices in China). Also changed the reference in this sentence to these being 'open-access *only*' publishers, to distinguish them from hybrid open access journals.</comment>

[[File:Open Access logo PLoS white.svg|thumb|upright|Open access logo, originally designed by [[Public Library of Science]].]]

'''Open access''' ('''OA''') refers to [[research]] outputs which are distributed online and free of cost or other barriers,&lt;ref name="suber overview"&gt;{{cite web |last=Suber |first=Peter |title=Open Access Overview |url=http://legacy.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/overview.htm |access-date=29 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070519103647/http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/overview.htm |archive-date=2017-05-19 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and possibly with the addition of a [[Creative Commons license]] to promote reuse.&lt;ref name="suber overview"/&gt; Open access can be applied to all forms of published research output, including [[peer-reviewed]] and non peer-reviewed [[academic journal]] articles, [[conference papers]], [[theses]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schöpfel |first1=Joachim |last2=Prost |first2=Hélène |year=2013 |title=Degrees of secrecy in an open environment.

Academic articles (as historically seen in paper-based [[academic journal]]s) have been the main focus of the movement. Conventional (non-open access) journals cover publishing costs through [[Subscription business model|access tolls]] such as subscriptions, site licenses or [[pay-per-view]] charges. Open access research is advanced by a range of distribution mechanisms and business models. These include:
* [[Self-archiving]] - green: After peer review by a journal, the author posts the same content the journal will be publishing to a web site controlled by the author, the research institution that funded or hosted the work, or which has been set up as a central open access repository.
* [[Open access journal]]: The publisher of the journal makes all articles and related content available for free on the journal's web site.
** Open access journal funded by [[article processing charge]]s paid by authors or research sponsor - gold&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Suber|2012|pp=138–139}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Open access journal funded by an [[academic institution]], [[learned society]] or a government information center (no publication fees are paid by authors) - platinum,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Machovec |first1=George |year=2013 |title=An Interview with Jeffrey Beall on Open Access Publishing |journal=The Charleston Advisor |volume=15 |pages=50 |doi=10.5260/chara.15.1.50 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Öchsner |first1=A. |year=2013 |chapter=Publishing Companies, Publishing Fees, and Open Access Journals |title=Introduction to Scientific Publishing |pages=23–29 |series=SpringerBriefs in Applied Sciences and Technology |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-38646-6_4 |isbn=978-3-642-38645-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; diamond,&lt;ref name=fuchs2013&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fuchs |first1=Christian |last2=Sandoval |first2=Marisol |year=2013 |title=The diamond model of open access publishing: Why policy makers, scholars, universities, libraries, labour unions and the publishing world need to take non-commercial, non-profit open access serious |journal=TripleC |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=428–443 |url=http://triplec.at/index.php/tripleC/article/view/502/497}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gaj/&gt; or gold&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Harris |first1=Siân |date=August 2012 |title=Moving towards an open access future: the role of academic libraries |url=https://studysites.uk.sagepub.com/repository/binaries/pdf/Library-OAReport.pdf |publisher=Sage Publications |accessdate=2018-03-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Delayed open-access journal]]s - provide open access after an [[Embargo (academic publishing)|embargo]] period, typically 6–12 months or longer&lt;ref name="Suber2012" /&gt; 
* [[Hybrid open access journal]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Suber|2012|pp=140–141}}&lt;/ref&gt; at least partially funded by subscriptions, and only provide open access for those individual articles for which the authors (or research sponsor) pay a publication fee&lt;ref name="Suber2012"&gt;{{harvnb|Suber|2012|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advantages and disadvantages of open access have generated considerable discussion amongst researchers, academics, librarians, university administrators, funding agencies, government officials, commercial [[publisher]]s, editorial staff and [[learned society|society]] publishers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Markin |first=Pablo |date=25 April 2017 |title=The Sustainability of Open Access Publishing Models Past a Tipping Point |url=http://openscience.com/the-sustainability-of-open-access-publishing-models-past-a-tipping-point/ |website=[[OpenScience]] |accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reactions of existing publishers to open access journal publishing have ranged from moving with enthusiasm to a new open access business model, to experiments with providing as much free or open access as possible, to active lobbying against open access proposals. There are many publishers that started up as open access-only  publishers, such as [[Public Library of Science|PLOS]], [[Hindawi Publishing Corporation]], [[Frontiers Media|Frontiers in...]] journals, [[MDPI]] and [[BioMed Central]].

== Gratis and libre open access ==
In order to reflect actual practice in providing [[Gratis versus libre|two different types]] of open access, the further distinction between gratis open access and libre open access was added in 2006 by the principal drafter of the original [[Budapest Open Access Initiative|BOAI]] definition.&lt;ref name="Gratis and Libre Open Access"&gt;{{cite web |last=Suber |first=Peter |date=2008 |url=http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:4322580 |title=Gratis and Libre Open Access |accessdate=2011-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gratis open access refers to online access free of charge, and libre open access refers to online access free of charge plus some additional re-use rights.&lt;ref name="Gratis and Libre Open Access" /&gt; Libre open access covers the kinds of open access defined in the [[Budapest Open Access Initiative]], the [[Bethesda Statement on Open Access Publishing]] and the [[Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities]]. The re-use rights of libre OA are often specified by various specific [[Creative Commons license]]s;&lt;ref name="Suber 2012 68–69"&gt;{{harvnb|Suber|2012|pp=68–69}}&lt;/ref&gt; these almost all require [[Attribution (copyright)|attribution of authorship]] to the original authors.&lt;ref name="Gratis and Libre Open Access" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Suber statements"&gt;{{harvnb|Suber|2012|pp=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Open access publishing ==
One option for authors who wish to make their work openly accessible is to publish in a journal or book that makes research output immediately available from the publisher.&lt;ref name="linkinghub.elsevier.com"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.serrev.2007.12.005 |title=The Access/Impact Problem and the Green and Gold Roads to Open Access: An Update |year=2008 |last1=Harnad |first1=S |last2=Brody |first2=T |last3=Vallières |first3=F |last4=Carr |first4=L |last5=Hitchcock |first5=S |last6=Gingras |first6=Y |last7=Oppenheim |first7=C |last8=Hajjem |first8=C |last9=Hilf |first9=E |journal=Serials Review |volume=34 |pages=36–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is sometimes referred to as [[gold open access]].&lt;ref name="suber overview" /&gt;

There are many financial models for open access publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oad.simmons.edu/oadwiki/OA_journal_business_models |title=OA journal business models |website=Open Access Directory |year=2009–2012 |accessdate=2015-10-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018182443/http://oad.simmons.edu/oadwiki/OA_journal_business_models |archivedate=2015-10-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Open access can be provided by commercial publishers, who may publish open access as well as subscription-based journals, or dedicated open-access publishers such as [[Public Library of Science]] (PLOS) and [[BioMed Central]].

=== Article processing charges{{anchor|Author-pays model}}{{anchor|Fee-based}} ===
{{see also|Article processing charge}}
In one model of open access, journals generate revenue by charging publication fees in order to make the work openly available at the time of publication.&lt;ref name="Socha"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://openscience.com/how-much-do-top-publishers-charge-for-open-access/ |title=How Much Do Top Publishers Charge for Open Access? |first=Beata |last=Socha |website=openscience.com |date=20 April 2017 |accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fuchs2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gaj&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gajović |first1=S |title=Diamond Open Access in the quest for interdisciplinarity and excellence |journal=Croatian Medical Journal |date=31 August 2017 |volume=58 |issue=4 |pages=261–262 |pmid=28857518 |pmc=5577648}}&lt;/ref&gt; The money might come from the author but more often comes from the author's [[research grant]] or employer.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Some publishers will waive all or part of the fee for authors from [[Developing country|less developed economies]]. Journals charging publication fees normally take various steps to ensure that [[peer review]]ers do not know whether authors have requested, or been granted, fee waivers, or to ensure that every paper is approved by an independent editor with no financial stake in the journal.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} While the payments are often incurred ''per article published'' (e.g. [[BMC journals]] or [[PLOS ONE]]), there are some journals that apply them ''per manuscript submitted'' (e.g. [[Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics]] until recently) or ''per author'' ([[PeerJ]]). As of June 2018, only 26% of journals in the [[Directory of Open Access Journals]] (DOAJ) required payment of article processing charges. A 2013 study showed this practice was higher in journals with a scientific or medical focus (43% and 47% respectively), and lowest in journals publishing in the arts and humanities (0% and 4% respectively).&lt;ref name=Kozak&amp;Hartley&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kozak |first1=Marcin |last2=Hartley |first2=James |title=Publication fees for open access journals: Different disciplines-different methods |journal=Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology |date=Dec 2013 |volume=64 |issue=12 |pages=2591–2594 |doi=10.1002/asi.22972}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, many academic journals levied page charges, long before open access became a possibility.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

There currently is a growing global debate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kember|first1=Sarah|title=Opening Out from Open Access: Writing and Publishing in Response to Neoliberalism|url=http://adanewmedia.org/2014/04/|website=ADANewMedia|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kember|first1=Sarah|title=How Open is Open Access?|url=https://www.thebookseller.com/blogs/how-open-open-access-333306|website=The Bookseller|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Page|first1=Benedicte|title=Angry publishers debate OA monographs at IPG|url=https://www.thebookseller.com/news/angry-publishers-debate-oa-monographs-ipg-747211|website=The Bookseller |accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=INASP|title=Publishers for Development|url=http://www.pubs-for-dev.info/ |website=Publishers for Development|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.research4life.org/ |title=Research4Life|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; regarding open access's ideology and ethics and its related article processing charges, as they are being created and managed by academic journal and monograph publisher conglomerates together with some national and international academic institutions and government bodies. One controversy is "double dipping", where both authors and subscribers are charged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/open-access-policies/open-access-journals/double-dipping-policy|title=Open access double dipping policy|website=Cambridge Core}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groups offering open access solutions{{clarify|date=May 2018}} include the Publishers for Development and Research4Life projects and activities.

=== Subsidized open access publications{{anchor|No-fee}} ===
No-fee open access journals, also known as "platinum" or "diamond"&lt;ref name=fuchs2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gaj/&gt; have no fees for readers and no article processing charges or publication fees for authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Koroso |first1=Nesru H. |title=Diamond Open Access - UA Magazine |url=https://www.ua-magazine.com/diamond-open-access/ |website=UA Magazine |date=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They use a variety of [[business model]]s. As summarized by Peter Suber:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/newsletter/11-02-06.htm#nofee |title=No-fee open-access journals |website=SPARC open access Newsletter |date=November 2, 2006 |last=Suber |first=Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Some no-fee OA journals have direct or indirect subsidies from institutions like universities, laboratories, research centers, libraries, hospitals, museums, [[Learned society|learned societies]], foundations, or government agencies. Some have revenue from a separate line of non-OA publications. Some have revenue from advertising, auxiliary services, membership dues, endowments, reprints, or a print or premium edition. Some rely, more than other journals, on volunteerism. Some undoubtedly use a combination of these means".

Open access monographs are subsidized through a variety of means as well. [[Knowledge Unlatched]] and unglue.it crowdsource funding in order to make a work available open access.&lt;ref name="Montgomery"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Montgomery |first1=Lucy |title=Knowledge Unlatched:A Global Library Consortium Model for Funding Open Access Scholarly Books |journal=Cultural Science |date=2014 |volume=7 |issue=2 |hdl=20.500.11937/12680 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About unglue.it |url=https://unglue.it/about/ |website=unglue.it |accessdate=10 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Open access repositories ==
{{Main|Self-archiving}}

Self-archiving, also known as green open access, refers to the practice of depositing articles in an [[open access repository]], where it can be accessed for free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eve|first1=Martin|title=Open access and the humanities|date=2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9781107484016|pages=9–10|title-link=:wikisource:Open access and the humanities/Chapter 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Stevan Harnad|Harnad, S]]. 2007.

Many publishers permit authors to self-archive in an open access repository, but may place restrictions on which version of the work may be shared and/or require an embargo period following the original date of publication. What is deposited can be either a [[preprint]], or the peer-reviewed [[postprint]] – either the author's refereed, revised final draft or the publisher's version of record. Some publishers require delays, or an [[Embargo (academic publishing)|embargo]], on when a research output in a repository may be made open access.&lt;ref name=Embargos&gt;[http://sparceurope.org/embargoes/" SPARC Europe – Embargo Periods] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151118022056/http://sparceurope.org/embargoes/ |date=2015-11-18 }}.

== Searching for open-access publications ==
{{category see also|Scholarly search services|Full text scholarly online databases}}

Searching each open access repository individually is impractical. 
Open access articles can be found with a [[web search]], using any general [[search engine]] or those specialized for the scholarly and scientific literature, such as: [[Google Scholar]], [[OAIster]], 
[http://openaccess.xyz/about.html openaccess.xyz],&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160302173329/http://openaccess.xyz/about.html |date=2016-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [https://www.base-search.net/about/en/ base-search.net],&lt;ref name="base-search"&gt;{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216120421/http://www.base-search.net/about/en/ |date=2016-02-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [https://core.ac.uk/search/ core.ac.uk].&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312113305/https://core.ac.uk/search/ |date=2016-03-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many open-access repositories offer a programmable interface to query their content.
Some of them use a generic protocol, such as [[Protocol for Metadata Harvesting|OAI-PMH]] (eg [https://www.base-search.net/about/en/ base-search.net],&lt;ref name="base-search"/&gt; [https://api.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/oai HAL]).
In addition, some repositories propose a specific API, such as the [https://arxiv.org/help/api/index arXiv API], the [https://dev.dissem.in/api.html Dissemin API], the [https://unpaywall.org/products/api Unpaywall/oadoi API], the [https://www.base-search.net/about/download/base_interface.pdf base-search API].

== Distribution ==
{{See also|Scientific journal#Electronic publishing}}

Like the self-archived green open access articles, most gold open access journal articles are distributed via the [[World Wide Web]],&lt;ref name="suber overview"/&gt; due to low distribution costs, increasing reach, speed, and increasing importance for scholarly communication. [[Open source software]] is sometimes used for [[open access repositories]],&lt;ref name="BOAI FAQ"&gt;[http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/boaifaq.htm Budapest Open Access Initiative, FAQ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060703153606/http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/boaifaq.htm |date=2006-07-03 }}.

Access to online content requires Internet access, and this distributional consideration presents physical and sometimes financial barriers to access. Proponents of open access argue that Internet access barriers are relatively low in many circumstances, that efforts should be made to subsidize universal Internet access, whereas pay-for-access presents a relatively high additional barrier over and above Internet access itself.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

There are various open access aggregators that list open access journals or articles. ROAD&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://road.issn.org/|title=Welcome - ROAD|website=road.issn.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the Directory of Open Access scholarly Resources) synthesizes information about open access journals and is a subset of the [[ISSN]] register. The [[OALibrary]] provides open and free access to a large database of scientific research papers, covering all topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://oalibrary.org/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-12-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170710171544/https://oalibrary.org/ |archivedate=2017-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Users may browse to find open access journals by country or by subject. [[SHERPA/RoMEO]] lists international publishers that allow the published version of articles to be deposited in [[institutional repositories]]. The [[Directory of Open Access Journals]] (DOAJ) contains over 8,000 peer-reviewed open access journals of varying open access policies for searching and browsing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mcphs.libguides.com/open_access/finding|title=Research Guides: Open Access: Finding Open Access Content|first=Greg|last=Martin|website=mcphs.libguides.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, several universities founded the [[Public Knowledge Project]] to foster open access, and developed the open-source journal publishing system [[Open Journal Systems]], among other scholarly software projects. As of 2010, it was being used by approximately 5,000 journals worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Edgar|first1=Brian D.|last2=Willinsky|first2=John|title=A survey of scholarly journals using open journal systems|journal=Scholarly and Research Communication|date=14 June 2010|volume=1|issue=2|url=http://src-online.ca/index.php/src/article/view/24/41|issn=1923-0702}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several initiatives provide an alternative to the American and English language dominance of existing publication indexing systems, including [[Index Copernicus]] (Polish), [[SciELO]] (Portuguese, Spanish) and [[Redalyc]] (Spanish).

== Motivations ==
{{Main|Academic journal publishing reform}}
Open access itself (mostly green and gratis) began to be sought and provided worldwide by researchers when the possibility itself was opened by the advent of [[Internet]] and the [[World Wide Web]]. The momentum was further increased by a growing movement for academic journal publishing reform, and with it gold and libre OA. Electronic publishing created new benefits as compared to paper publishing but beyond that, it contributed to causing problems in traditional publishing models.

The premises behind open access publishing are that there are viable funding models to maintain traditional [[peer review]] standards of quality while also making the following changes:
* Rather than making journal articles accessible through a [[subscription business model]], all academic publications could be made free to read and published with some other cost-recovery model, such as publication charges, subsidies, or charging subscriptions only for the print edition, with the online edition [[Gratis versus libre|gratis]] or "free to read".&lt;ref name="Suber29-43"&gt;{{harvnb|Suber|2012|pp=29–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rather than applying traditional notions of [[copyright]] to academic publications, they could be [[wikt:libre#Adjective|libre]] or "free to build upon".&lt;ref name="Suber29-43" /&gt;

An obvious advantage of open access journals is the free access to scientific papers regardless of affiliation with a subscribing library and improved access for the general public; this is especially true in developing countries. Lower costs for research in academia and industry have been claimed in the [[Budapest Open Access Initiative]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://poynder.blogspot.com.br/2015/03/the-life-and-death-of-open-access.html |title=The Life and Death of an Open Access Journal: Q&amp;A with Librarian Marcus Banks}}, "As the BOAI text expressed it, “the overall costs of providing open access to this literature are far lower than the costs of traditional forms of dissemination.”"&lt;/ref&gt; although others have argued that OA may raise the [[total cost]] of publication,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2015/03/25/gold-open-access-in-practice-total-costs-of-publication/ |title=Gold open access in practice: How will universities respond to the rising total cost of publication?}}&lt;/ref&gt; and further increase economic incentives for exploitation in academic publishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lepublikateur.de/2018/06/04/reasoning-interest-open-access/|title=Reasoning and Interest: Clustering Open Access - LePublikateur|date=2018-06-04|work=LePublikateur|access-date=2018-06-05|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The open access movement is motivated by the problems of social inequality caused by restricting access to academic research, which favor large and wealthy institutions with the financial means to purchase access to many journals, as well as the economic challenges and perceived unsustainability of academic publishing.&lt;ref name="Suber29-43" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Tennant |first=Jonathan P. |last2=Waldner |first2=François |last3=Jacques |first3=Damien C. |last4=Masuzzo |first4=Paola |last5=Collister |first5=Lauren B. |last6=Hartgerink |first6=Chris.

=== Stakeholders and concerned communities ===
The intended audience of research articles is usually other researchers. Open access helps researchers as readers by opening up access to articles that their libraries do not subscribe to. One of the great beneficiaries of open access may be users in [[developing countries]], where currently some [[universities]] find it difficult to pay for subscriptions required to access the most recent journals.&lt;ref&gt;Sivaraj, S., et al. 2008. [http://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/~mbolin/sivaraj.htm "Resource Sharing among Engineering College Libraries in Tamil Nadu in a Networking System"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121224163629/http://webpages.uidaho.edu/%7Embolin/sivaraj.htm |date=2012-12-24 }}. Library Philosophy and Practice.&lt;/ref&gt; Some schemes exist for providing subscription scientific publications to those affiliated to institutions in developing countries at little or no cost.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.research4life.org/about/ "Developing World Access to Leading Research"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131201154532/http://www.research4life.org/about/ |date=2013-12-01 }}. research4life.org. Retrieved on 2012-11-19.&lt;/ref&gt; All researchers benefit from open access as no library can afford to subscribe to every [[scientific journal]] and most can only afford a small fraction of them – this is known as the "[[serials crisis]]".&lt;ref&gt;Van Orsdel, Lee C. &amp; Born, Kathleen. 2005. {{cite web |url=http://lj.libraryjournal.com/2005/04/publishing/periodicals-price-survey-2005-choosing-sides/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-10-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170630021651/http://lj.libraryjournal.com/2005/04/publishing/periodicals-price-survey-2005-choosing-sides/ |archivedate=2017-06-30 |df= }} "Periodicals Price Survey 2005: Choosing Sides"] Library Journal, 15 April 2005.

Open access extends the reach of research beyond its immediate academic circle. An open access article can be read by anyone – a [[professional]] in the field, a [[researcher]] in another field, a [[journalist]], a [[politician]] or [[civil servant]], or an interested [[layperson]]. Indeed, a 2008 study revealed that [[mental health professional]]s are roughly twice as likely to read a relevant article if it is freely available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hardisty |first1=David J. |last2=Haaga |first2=David A.F. |year=2008 |title=Diffusion of Treatment Research: Does Open Access Matter? |url=http://decisionsciences.columbia.edu/papers/hardisty-haaga-2008-preprint.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Journal of Clinical Psychology |volume=64 |issue=7 |pages=821–839 |doi=10.1002/jclp.20492 |pmid=18425790 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528051630/http://decisionsciences.columbia.edu/papers/hardisty-haaga-2008-preprint.pdf |archivedate=2008-05-28 |df= |citeseerx=10.1.1.487.5198 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other studies, both major and minor and with varying degrees of methodological rigor, find that an open access article is more likely to be used and cited than one behind subscription barriers.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[http://opcit.eprints.org/oacitation-biblio.html Effect of OA on citation impact: a bibliography of studies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171102234006/http://opcit.eprints.org/oacitation-biblio.html |date=2017-11-02 }}.

For example, a 2006 study in ''[[PLoS Biology]]'' found that articles published as immediate open access in ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|PNAS]]'' were three times more likely to be cited than non-open access papers, and were also cited more than ''PNAS'' articles that were only self-archived.&lt;ref name=Eysenbach/&gt; This result has been challenged as an artifact of authors self-selectively paying to publish their higher quality articles in hybrid open access journals,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Gaulé |first1=P. |last2=Maystre |first2=N. |doi=10.1016/j.respol.2011.05.025 |title=Getting cited: Does open access help? |journal=Research Policy |volume=40 |issue=10 |pages=1332–1338 |year=2011 |pmid= |pmc=|url=http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/129058 |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas a 2010 study found that the open access citation advantage was equally big whether self-archiving was self-selected or mandated.&lt;ref name=Gargouri/&gt;

A 2010 study of 27,197 articles in 1,984 journals used institutionally mandated open access instead of randomized open access to control for bias on the part of authors toward self-selectively making their better (hence more citeable) articles open access. The result was a replication of the repeatedly reported open access citation advantage, with the advantage being equal in size and significance whether the open access was self-selected or mandated.&lt;ref name=Gargouri&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gargouri|first1=Yassine|last2=Hajjem|first2=Chawki|last3=Larivière|first3=Vincent|last4=Gingras|first4=Yves|last5=Carr|first5=Les|last6=Brody|first6=Tim|last7=Harnad|first7=Stevan|last8=Futrelle|first8=Robert P.|authorlink7=Stevan Harnad|date=18 October 2010|title= Self-selected or mandated, open access increases citation impact for higher quality research|volume=5|issue=10|page= e13636|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0013636|arxiv=1001.0361|journal=[[PLOS One]]|editor1-last=Futrelle|editor1-first=Robert P|pmid=20976155|pmc=2956678|bibcode=2010PLoSO...513636G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2016 study reported that the odds of an open access journal being referenced on the English Wikipedia are 47% higher than for paywalled journals, and suggested that this constitutes a significant "amplifier" effect for science published on such platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Teplitskiy|first1=M.|last2=Lu|first2=G.|last3=Duede|first3=E.|year=2016|title=Amplifying the impact of open access: Wikipedia and the diffusion of science|journal=Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology|volume=68|issue=9|pages=2116|doi=10.1002/asi.23687|arxiv=1506.07608}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars are paid by research funders and/or their universities to do research; the published article is the report of the work they have done, rather than an item for commercial gain.

Some professional organizations have encouraged use of open access: in 2001, the [[International Mathematical Union]] communicated to its members that "Open access to the mathematical literature is an important goal" and encouraged them to "[make] available electronically as much of our own work as feasible" to "[enlarge] the reservoir of freely available primary mathematical material, particularly helping scientists working without adequate library access."&lt;ref name="imu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cr.yp.to/bib/imu-call.html |title=Call to All Mathematicians |author=Committee on Electronic Information and Communication (CEIC) of the [[International Mathematical Union]] |date=15 May 2001 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607051055/http://cr.yp.to/bib/imu-call.html |archivedate=7 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Research funders and universities ===

{{Further|Open-access mandate#Instances}}

[[Research funding]] agencies and universities want to ensure that the research they fund and support in various ways has the greatest possible research impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dfid.gov.uk/What-we-do/Research-and-evidence/case-studies/research-case-studies/2012/DFIDs-policy-opens-up-a-world-of-global-research/ |title=DFID Research: DFID's Policy Opens up a World of Global Research |website=dfid.gov.uk |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130103141246/http://www.dfid.gov.uk/What-we-do/Research-and-evidence/case-studies/research-case-studies/2012/DFIDs-policy-opens-up-a-world-of-global-research/ |archivedate=2013-01-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a means of achieving this, research funders are beginning to expect open access to the research they support. Many of them (including all seven UK Research Councils) have already adopted green open access [[self-archiving]] mandates, and others are on the way to do so (see [[ROARMAP]]).

In 2008, the [[NIH Public Access Policy]], an open access mandate was put into law, and required that research papers describing research funded by the National Institutes of Health must be available to the public free through PubMed Central within 12 months of publication.

==== Universities ====
A growing number of universities are providing institutional repositories in which their researchers can deposit their published articles. Some open access advocates believe that institutional repositories will play a very important role in responding to open access mandates from funders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://openaccess.eprints.org/index.php?/archives/369-guid.html How To Integrate University and Funder Open Access Mandates] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316202403/http://openaccess.eprints.org/index.php?%2Farchives%2F369-guid.html |date=2008-03-16 }}.

In 2011, a group of universities in North America formed the Coalition of Open Access Policy Institutions (COAPI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sparc.arl.org/COAPI |title=Coalition of Open Access Policy Institutions (COAPI) – SPARC |website=arl.org |accessdate=2015-10-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018182442/http://www.sparc.arl.org/COAPI |archivedate=2015-10-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting with 21 institutions where the faculty had either established an open access policy or were in the process of implementing one, COAPI now has nearly 50 members. These institutions' administrators, faculty and librarians, and staff support the international work of the Coalition's awareness-raising and advocacy for open access. Members agree to the following COAPI Principles:
# The immediate and barrier-free online dissemination of scholarly research resulting in faster growth of new knowledge, increased impact of research, and improved return on public research investments
# Developing and implementing institutional open access policies
# Sharing experiences and best practices in the development and implementation of Open Access Policies with individuals at institutions interested in cultivating cultures of open access

=== Libraries and librarians ===
As information professionals, [[librarian]]s are vocal and active advocates of open access. These librarians believe that open access promises to remove both the ''price barriers'' and the ''permission barriers'' that undermine library efforts to provide access to the scholarly record,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Suber |first1=Peter |title=Removing the Barriers to Research: An Introduction to Open Access for Librarians |journal=College &amp; Research Libraries News |date=2003 |volume=62 |issue=2 |pages=92–94, 113 |url=https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/3715477}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as helping to address the [[serials crisis]]. Many library associations have either signed major open access declarations, or created their own. For example, the [[Canadian Library Association]] endorsed a Resolution on Open Access in June 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[https://mx2.arl.org/Lists/SPARC-OAForum/Message/2017.html SPARC-OAForum@arl.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716120016/https://mx2.arl.org/Lists/SPARC-OAForum/Message/2017.html |date=2011-07-16 }}.

Librarians also lead education and outreach initiatives to faculty, administrators, and others about the benefits of open access. For example, the [[Association of College and Research Libraries]] of the [[American Library Association]] has developed a Scholarly Communications Toolkit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ala.org/ala/acrl/acrlissues/scholarlycomm/scholarlycommunicationtoolkit/toolkit.htm ALA] Scholarly Communication Toolkit {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050908035323/http://www.ala.org/ala/acrl/acrlissues/scholarlycomm/scholarlycommunicationtoolkit/toolkit.htm |date=September 8, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Association of Research Libraries]] has documented the need for increased access to scholarly information, and was a leading founder of the [[Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition]] (SPARC).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sparc.arl.org/ Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130815193855/http://www.sparc.arl.org/ |date=2013-08-15 }}.

=== Public ===
Open access to scholarly research is argued to be important to the public for a number of reasons. One of the arguments for public access to the scholarly literature is that most of the research is paid for by taxpayers through [[government grant]]s, who therefore have a right to access the results of what they have funded. This is one of the primary reasons for the creation of advocacy groups such as The Alliance for Taxpayer Access in the US.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taxpayeraccess.org/ ATA | The Alliance for Taxpayer Access] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927194105/http://www.taxpayeraccess.org/ |date=2007-09-27 }}.

Retrieved on 2011-12-03.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of people who might wish to read scholarly literature include individuals with medical conditions (or family members of such individuals) and serious hobbyists or 'amateur' scholars who may be interested in specialized scientific literature (e.g. [[Amateur astronomy|amateur astronomers]]). Additionally, professionals in many fields may be interested in continuing education in the research literature of their field, and many businesses and academic institutions cannot afford to purchase articles from or subscriptions to much of the research literature that is published under a toll access model.

Even those who do not read scholarly articles benefit indirectly from open access.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120213162340/http://eprints.rclis.org/handle/10760/6842 Open Access: Basics and Benefits].

Open access online, by contrast is faster, often immediate, making it more suitable than interlibrary loan for fast-paced research.

=== Low-income countries ===
In developing nations, open access archiving and publishing acquires a unique importance. Scientists, health care professionals, and institutions in developing nations often do not have the capital necessary to access scholarly literature, although schemes exist to give them access for little or no cost. Among the most important is [[HINARI]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/hinari/en/ World Health Organization] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127162901/http://www.who.int/hinari/en/ |date=2012-01-27 }} Health InterNetwork Access to Research Initiative&lt;/ref&gt; the Health InterNetwork Access to Research Initiative, sponsored by the [[World Health Organization]]. HINARI, however, also has restrictions. For example, individual researchers may not register as users unless their institution has access,&lt;ref name=WHOeligibility&gt;[http://www.who.int/hinari/eligibility/en/ World Health Organization] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422171846/http://www.who.int/hinari/eligibility/en/ |date=2009-04-22 }}: Eligibility&lt;/ref&gt; and several countries that one might expect to have access do not have access at all (not even "low-cost" access) (e.g. South Africa).&lt;ref name=WHOeligibility /&gt;

Many open access projects involve international collaboration. For example, the [[SciELO]] (Scientific Electronic Library Online),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scielo.org/index.php?lang=en Scientific Electronic Library Online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050831151907/http://www.scielo.org/index.php?lang=en |date=2005-08-31 }}. SciELO. Retrieved on 2011-12-03.&lt;/ref&gt; is a comprehensive approach to full open access journal publishing, involving a number of [[Latin America]]n countries. [[Bioline International]], a [[non-profit organization]] dedicated to helping publishers in developing countries is a collaboration of people in the UK, Canada, and Brazil; the Bioline International Software is used around the world. [[Research Papers in Economics]] (RePEc), is a collaborative effort of over 100 volunteers in 45 countries. The [[Public Knowledge Project]] in [[Canada]] developed the [[open source]] publishing software [[Open Journal Systems]] (OJS), which is now in use around the world, for example by the [[African Journals Online]] group, and one of the most active development groups is Portuguese. This international perspective has resulted in advocacy for the development of [[open-source appropriate technology]] and the necessary open access to relevant information for [[sustainable development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Pearce |first1=J. M. |title=The case for open source appropriate technology |doi=10.1007/s10668-012-9337-9 |journal=Environment, Development and Sustainability |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=425–431 |year=2012 |pmid= |pmc=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A.

==Criticism==
The main argument against open access, author's paid fee based journals, is the possible damage to the [[peer review]] system, diminishing the overall quality of scientific journal publishing. For example, in 2009, a hoax paper generated by a computer program was accepted for publication by a major publisher under the [[Author-pays model|author-pays-for-publication model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gilbert|first1=Natasha|title=Editor will quit over hoax paper|journal=Nature|date=15 June 2009|doi=10.1038/news.2009.571}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar [[Who's Afraid of Peer Review?|incident]], a staff writer for Science magazine and popular science publications targeted the open access system in 2013 by submitting to some such journals a deeply flawed paper on the purported effect of a lichen constituent. About 60% of those journals, including journals published by the major academic publishers [[Sage Publications]] and [[Elsevier]] the Journal of Natural Pharmaceuticals, accepted the faked medical paper. However, journals published by notable open access publishers [[Public Library of Science|PLOS]], [[BioMed Central]], and [[Hindawi Publishing Corporation]] rejected the fake article. In addition, the faked paper was not published in subscription journals as a control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bohannon|first1=John|title=Who's afraid of peer review?|journal=Science|date=4 October 2013|volume=342|issue=6154|pages=60–65|doi=10.1126/science.342.6154.60|pmid=24092725}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, this experiment was criticized for using a flawed methodology and not including a control group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eve|first=Martin|title=What's "open" got to do with it?|url=https://www.martineve.com/2013/10/03/whats-open-got-to-do-with-it/|website=Martin Eve|accessdate=7 October 2013|date=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Michael|first=Eisen|title=I confess, I wrote the Arsenic DNA paper to expose flaws in peer-review at subscription-based journals |url=http://www.michaeleisen.org/blog/?p=1439|website=it is NOT junk|accessdate=7 October 2013|date=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many newer open access journals also lack the reputation of their subscription counterparts, which have been in business for decades. This effect has been diminishing though since 2001, reflecting the emergence of high quality professional open access publishers such as [[PLOS]] and [[BioMed Central]].&lt;ref name=Björk/&gt;

Opponents of the open access model continue to assert that the pay-for-access model is necessary to ensure that the publishers are adequately compensated for their work. Scholarly journal publishers that support pay-for-access claim that the "gatekeeper" role they play, maintaining a scholarly reputation, arranging for peer review, and editing and indexing articles, require economic resources that are not supplied under an open access model. Opponents claim that open access is not necessary to ensure fair access for developing nations; differential pricing or financial aid from developed countries or institutions can make access to proprietary journals affordable. Some critics also point out the lack of funding for author fees.&lt;ref name=vogel&gt;{{cite web | author=Vogel, Gretchen | url=http://news.sciencemag.org/2011/01/quandary-scientists-prefer-reading-over-publishing-open-access-papers | title=Quandary: Scientists Prefer Reading Over Publishing 'open-access' Papers | publisher=Science | date=January 14, 2011 | accessdate=2012-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study published in 2010 showed that roughly 20% of the total number of peer-reviewed articles published in 2008 could be found openly accessible.&lt;ref name="doi10.1371/journal.pone.0011273"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Björk |first1=B.

For an additional 11.9% of the articles, open access full text copies were available via green open access in either subject-based repositories (43%), institutional repositories (24%) or on the home pages of the authors or their departments (33%). These copies were further classified into exact copies of the published article (38%), manuscripts as accepted for publishing (46%) or manuscripts as submitted (15%).&lt;ref name="doi10.1371/journal.pone.0011273" /&gt;

In the 2010 study, of all scientific fields chemistry had the lowest overall share of open access (13%), while Earth Sciences had the highest (33%). In medicine, biochemistry and chemistry gold publishing in open access journals was more common than author self-archiving. In all other fields self-archiving was more common.
 
In 2009, there were approximately 4,800 active open access journals, publishing around 190,000 articles.&lt;ref name="Björk2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Björk |first1=Bo-Christer |year=2011 |title=A Study of Innovative Features in Scholarly Open Access Journals |journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=e115 |doi=10.2196/jmir.1802 |pmid=22173122 |pmc=3278101 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of October 2015, this had increased to over 10,000 open access journals listed in the [[Directory of Open Access Journals]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Directory of Open Access Journals |url=https://doaj.org/ |publisher=Directory of Open Access Journals |accessdate=20 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; though this number has fallen to 9,500 in January 2017. A study of random journals from the [[citation index|citations indexes]] AHSCI, SCI and SSCI in 2013 came to the result that 88% of the journals were closed access and 12% were open access.&lt;ref name="fuchs2013"/&gt;

'''Overseas Student Health Care''' is a compulsory [[health insurance]] product required by [[international student]]s studying in [[Australia]]. OSHC is an insurance product that basically gives international students a level of insurance coverage that is based on the Australian [[Medicare (Australia)|Medicare]] system. Overseas Student Health Cover is commonly referred to as OSHC. Students can arrange to pay for their OSHC through their educational institution. However, students can still choose their own OSHC provider even when their educational institution makes a specific recommendation because they have negotiated a preferred provider arrangement with a particular insurer.

== Deed ==

OSHC is only able to be offered by Australian private health insurers who have signed the Deed for the provision of Overseas Student Health Cover with the Australian government. The Deed outlines the conditions required to be met by the registered insurers in order to offer the OSHC product. A legal document between the Commonwealth of Australia and the relevant insurer, the Deed dictates the minimum benefits payable by the insurer, in addition to conditions for which it is not required to pay any benefits. 
In addition, clause 6.8 of the Deed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/BB6090580215B214CA256F1900166600/$File/Template%20Overseas%20Student%20Health%20Cover%20Deed%20-%201%20July%202011.pdf | title=Template Overseas Student Health Cover Deed | archiveurl=http://webarchive.nla.gov.au/gov/20130409180938/http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/BB6090580215B214CA256F1900166600/$File/Template%20Overseas%20Student%20Health%20Cover%20Deed%20-%201%20July%202011.pdf | archivedate=2013-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; stipulates the conditions under which the insurers can terminate policies and make refunds, specifically:

[[File:1918FluVictimsStLouis.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.2|[[1918 flu pandemic|The 1918–1919 "Spanish flu" pandemic]] resulted in dramatic mortality worldwide.]]

A '''pandemic''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] πᾶν ''pan'' "all" and δῆμος ''demos'' "people") is an [[epidemic]] of [[infectious disease]] that has spread across a large region; for instance multiple [[continents]], or even worldwide.

A widespread [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] disease that is stable in terms of how many people are getting sick from it is not a pandemic. Further, [[Influenza pandemic|flu pandemics]] generally exclude recurrences of [[seasonal flu]]. Throughout history, there have been a number of pandemics, such as [[smallpox]] and [[tuberculosis]]. One of the most devastating pandemics was the [[Black Death]], which killed over 75 million people in 1350. The most recent pandemics include the [[HIV]] pandemic as well as the [[1918 flu pandemic|1918]]  and [[2009 flu pandemic|2009]] [[Influenza A virus subtype H1N1|H1N1]] pandemics.

== Definition and stages ==

[[File:Pandemie.jpg|thumb|left|Advice (in French and English) for travellers on risks of epidemics abroad. Posters from the Charles De Gaulle airport, Paris, 2016.]]
A pandemic is an [[epidemic]] occurring on a scale which crosses international boundaries, usually affecting a large number of people.&lt;ref name=Porta2008&gt;{{cite book|author=Miquel Porta|editor=Miquel Porta|title=Dictionary of Epidemiology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Dr8dyuzvTkC&amp;pg=PA179|accessdate=14 September 2012|date=3 July 2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-531449-6|page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pandemics can also occur in important agricultural organisms (livestock, crop plants, fish, tree species) or in other organisms.

The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) has a six-stage classification that describes the process by which a novel influenza virus moves from the first few infections in humans through to a pandemic. This starts with the virus mostly infecting animals, with a few cases where animals infect people, then moves through the stage where the virus begins to spread directly between people, and ends with a pandemic when infections from the new virus have spread worldwide and it will be out of control until we stop it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/phase/en/ "Current WHO phase of pandemic alert"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928032422/http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/phase/en/ |date=2011-09-28 }}, World Health Organization 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

A disease or condition is not a pandemic merely because it is widespread or kills many people; it must also be infectious. For instance, [[cancer]] is responsible for many deaths but is not considered a pandemic because the disease is not infectious or contagious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=A. M.|first1=Dumar|title=Swine Flu: What You Need to Know|date=2009|publisher=Wildside Press LLC|isbn=9781434458322|page=7|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a virtual press conference in May 2009 on the influenza pandemic, Dr Keiji Fukuda, Assistant Director-General ''ad interim'' for Health Security and Environment, WHO said "An easy way to think about pandemic … is to say: a pandemic is a global outbreak. Then you might ask yourself: 'What is a global outbreak'? Global outbreak means that we see both spread of the agent … and then we see disease activities in addition to the spread of the virus."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/influenzaAH1N1_presstranscript_20090526.pdf |title=WHO press conference on 2009 pandemic influenza |format=PDF |date=26 May 2009 |publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=2010-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In planning for a possible influenza pandemic, the WHO published a document on pandemic preparedness guidance in 1999, revised in 2005 and in February 2009, defining phases and appropriate actions for each phase in an aide memoir entitled ''WHO pandemic phase descriptions and main actions by phase''. The 2009 revision, including definitions of a pandemic and the phases leading to its declaration, were finalized in February 2009. The pandemic H1N1 2009 virus was neither on the horizon at that time nor mentioned in the document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/PIPGuidance09.pdf|title=Pandemic influenza preparedness and response|publisher=World Health Organization|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513194204/http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/PIPGuidance09.pdf|archivedate=2011-05-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/GIPA3AideMemoire.pdf WHO pandemic phase descriptions and main actions by phase] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910112007/http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/GIPA3AideMemoire.pdf |date=September 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All versions of this document refer to influenza. The phases are defined by the spread of the disease; [[virulence]] and [[mortality rate|mortality]] are not mentioned in the current WHO definition, although these factors have previously been included.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,637119,00.html |title=A whole industry is waiting for an epidemic |work=Der Spiegel |date=21 July 2009 |accessdate=2010-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pandemics and notable epidemics through history ==
{{See also|List of epidemics|Columbian Exchange|Globalization and disease}}

There have been a number of significant pandemics recorded in human [[history]], generally [[zoonosis|zoonoses]] which came about with [[domestication]] of animals, such as [[influenza]] and tuberculosis. There have been a number of particularly significant epidemics that deserve mention above the "mere" destruction of cities:
* [[Plague of Athens]], 430 BC. Possibly [[typhoid fever]] killed a quarter of the Athenian troops, and a quarter of the population over four years. This disease fatally weakened the dominance of [[Athens]], but the sheer virulence of the disease prevented its wider spread; i.e. it killed off its hosts at a rate faster than they could spread it. The exact cause of the plague was unknown for many years. In January 2006, researchers from the [[University of Athens]] analyzed [[teeth]] recovered from a [[mass grave]] underneath the city, and confirmed the presence of [[bacteria]] responsible for typhoid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=000BF619-9B78-13D6-9B7883414B7F0135&amp;ref=sciam&amp;chanID=sa003 "Ancient Athenian Plague Proves to Be Typhoid"].

[[File:Bubonic plague victims-mass grave in Martigues, France 1720-1721.jpg|thumb|Bubonic plague victims in a mass grave from [[Great Plague of Marseille|1720–1721]] in Martigues, France]]
* [[Antonine Plague]], 165–180 AD. Possibly smallpox brought to the Italian peninsula by soldiers returning from the Near East; it killed a quarter of those infected, and up to five million in all.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4381924.stm Past pandemics that ravaged Europe]. ''BBC News'', November 7. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; At the height of a second outbreak, the [[Plague of Cyprian]] (251–266), which may have been the same disease, 5,000 people a day were said to be dying in [[Rome]].
* [[Plague of Justinian]], from 541 to 750, was the first recorded outbreak of the [[bubonic plague]]. It started in [[Egypt]], and reached [[Constantinople]] the following spring, killing (according to the Byzantine chronicler [[Procopius]]) 10,000 a day at its height, and perhaps 40% of the city's inhabitants. The plague went on to eliminate a quarter to a half of the [[human population]] that it struck throughout the known world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521846390&amp;ss=fro |title=Cambridge Catalogue page "Plague and the End of Antiquity" |publisher=Cambridge.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.speakeasy-forum.com/lofiversion/index.php/t18579.html Quotes from book "Plague and the End of Antiquity"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716114235/http://www.speakeasy-forum.com/lofiversion/index.php/t18579.html |date=2011-07-16 }} Lester K.

Encounters between European explorers and populations in the rest of the world often introduced local epidemics of extraordinary virulence. Disease killed part of the native population of the [[Canary Islands]] in the 16th century ([[Guanches]]). Half the native population of [[Hispaniola]] in 1518 was killed by smallpox. [[Smallpox]] also ravaged [[Mexico]] in the 1520s, killing 150,000 in [[Tenochtitlán]] alone, including the emperor, and [[Peru]] in the 1530s, aiding the European conquerors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/smallpox_01.shtml |title=Smallpox: Eradicating the Scourge |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2009-11-05 |accessdate=2010-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Measles]] killed a further two million Mexican natives in the 17th century.

=== Typhus ===
[[Typhus]] is sometimes called "camp fever" because of its pattern of flaring up in times of strife. (It is also known as "gaol fever" and "ship fever", for its habits of spreading wildly in cramped quarters, such as jails and ships.) Emerging during the [[Crusades]], it had its first impact in Europe in 1489, in Spain. During fighting between the Christian Spaniards and the Muslims in [[Granada]], the Spanish lost 3,000 to war casualties, and 20,000 to typhus. In 1528, the French lost 18,000 troops in [[Italy]], and lost supremacy in Italy to the Spanish. In 1542, 30,000 soldiers died of typhus while fighting the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] in the Balkans.

During the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–1648), about 8 million Germans were killed by bubonic plague and typhus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,794989,00.html War and Pestilence].

=== Measles ===
Historically, [[measles]] was prevalent throughout the world, as it is highly contagious. According to the U.S. [[National Immunization Program]], 90% of people were infected with measles by age 15. Before the vaccine was introduced in 1963, there were an estimated 3–4 million
cases in the U.S. each year.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Center for Disease Control &amp; National Immunization Program. Measles History, article online 2001.

Measles is an [[endemic disease]], meaning that it has been continually present in a community, and many people develop resistance. In populations that have not been exposed to measles, exposure to a new disease can be devastating.

=== Malaria ===
[[Malaria]] is widespread in [[Tropics|tropical]] and subtropical regions, including parts of the [[Americas]], [[Asia]], and [[Africa]]. Each year, there are approximately 350–500 million cases of malaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/facts.htm |title=Malaria Facts |access-date=2017-09-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121229091605/http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/facts.htm |archive-date=2012-12-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Drug resistance]] poses a growing problem in the treatment of malaria in the 21st century, since resistance is now common against all classes of antimalarial drugs, except for the [[artemisinin]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=White NJ |title=Antimalarial drug resistance |journal=J.

== Concern about possible future pandemics ==

=== Viral hemorrhagic fevers ===
Viral hemorrhagic fevers such as [[Ebola virus disease]], [[Lassa fever virus]], [[Rift Valley fever]], [[Marburg virus]] and [[Bolivian hemorrhagic fever]] are highly contagious and deadly diseases, with the theoretical potential to become pandemics. Their ability to spread efficiently enough to cause a pandemic is limited, however, as transmission of these viruses requires close contact with the infected [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]], and the vector only has a short time before death or serious illness. Furthermore, the short time between a vector becoming infectious and the onset of symptoms allows medical professionals to quickly [[quarantine]] vectors, and prevent them from carrying the pathogen elsewhere. Genetic mutations could occur, which could elevate their potential for causing widespread harm; thus close observation by contagious disease specialists is merited.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

=== Antibiotic resistance ===
{{Main|Antibiotic resistance}}
Antibiotic-resistant microorganisms, sometimes referred to as "[[Antibiotic resistance|superbug]]s", may contribute to the re-emergence of diseases which are currently well controlled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pasteur.fr/actu/presse/press/07pesteTIGR_E.htm Researchers sound the alarm: the multidrug resistance of the plague bacillus could spread] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014012153/http://www.pasteur.fr/actu/presse/press/07pesteTIGR_E.htm |date=2007-10-14 }}. Pasteur.fr&lt;/ref&gt; For example, cases of tuberculosis that are resistant to traditionally effective treatments remain a cause of great concern to health professionals. Every year, nearly half a million new cases of [[multidrug-resistant tuberculosis]] (MDR-TB) are estimated to occur worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2009/tuberculosis_drug_resistant_20090402/en/index.html Health ministers to accelerate efforts against drug-resistant TB]. ''World Health Organization.''&lt;/ref&gt; China and India have the highest rate of multidrug-resistant TB.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2009/apr/01/bill-gates-tb-timebomb-china Bill Gates joins Chinese government in tackling TB 'timebomb']. ''Guardian.co.uk''. April 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) reports that approximately 50 million people worldwide are infected with MDR TB, with 79 percent of those cases resistant to three or more antibiotics. In 2005, 124 cases of [[MDR TB]] were reported in the United States. Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis ([[XDR TB]]) was identified in Africa in 2006, and subsequently discovered to exist in 49 countries, including the United States. There are about 40,000 new cases of XDR-TB per year, the WHO estimates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2008/HEALTH/11/17/tb.pandemic/index.html Tuberculosis: A new pandemic?]. CNN.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past 20 years, common bacteria including ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', ''[[Serratia marcescens]]'' and [[Enterococcus]], have developed resistance to various [[antibiotics]] such as [[vancomycin]], as well as whole classes of antibiotics, such as the [[aminoglycosides]] and [[cephalosporins]]. Antibiotic-resistant organisms have become an important cause of healthcare-associated (nosocomial) infections (HAI). In addition, infections caused by community-acquired strains of methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'' ([[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]]) in otherwise healthy individuals have become more frequent in recent years. &lt;!-- Antibiotics are not described as "strongest"; each has a specific range of activity. Antibiotics that are effective against many types of bacteria are termed "broad spectrum". Vancomycin is only effective against Gram-positive organisms, such as sensitive strains of ''S. aureus'' and Enterococcus. --&gt; &lt;!-- HAIs are a serious concern, but do not meet the definition of a pandemic --&gt;

=== SARS ===
In 2003 the Italian physician [[Carlo Urbani]] (1956–2003) was the first to identify severe acute respiratory syndrome ([[SARS]]) as a new and dangerously contagious disease, although he became infected and died. It is caused by a [[coronavirus]] dubbed [[SARS-CoV]]. Rapid action by national and international health authorities such as the [[World Health Organization]] helped to slow transmission and eventually broke the chain of transmission, which ended the localized epidemics before they could become a pandemic. However, the disease has not been eradicated. It could re-emerge. This warrants monitoring and reporting of suspicious cases of atypical pneumonia.

=== Influenza ===
{{Main|Influenza pandemic}}

Wild aquatic birds are the natural hosts for a range of [[influenza]] A viruses. Occasionally, viruses are transmitted from these species to other species, and may then cause outbreaks in domestic poultry or, rarely, in humans.&lt;ref name=sobrino6&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.horizonpress.com/avir |author=Klenk|year=2008 |chapter=Avian Influenza: Molecular Mechanisms of Pathogenesis and Host Range |title=Animal Viruses: Molecular Biology |publisher=Caister Academic Press |isbn=978-1-904455-22-6|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kawaoka&gt;{{cite book |author=Kawaoka Y (editor). |title=Influenza Virology: Current Topics |publisher=Caister Academic Press |year=2006 |url=http://www.horizonpress.com/flu |isbn=978-1-904455-06-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== H5N1 (Avian Flu) ====
{{Main|Influenza A virus subtype H5N1}}

In February 2004, [[avian influenza]] virus was detected in birds in [[Vietnam]], increasing fears of the emergence of new variant strains. It is feared that if the avian influenza virus combines with a human influenza virus (in a bird or a human), the new subtype created could be both highly contagious and highly lethal in humans. Such a subtype could cause a global influenza pandemic, similar to the [[Spanish Flu]], or the lower mortality pandemics such as the [[Asian Flu]] and the [[Hong Kong Flu]].

From October 2004 to February 2005, some 3,700 test kits of the 1957 [[Asian Flu]] virus were accidentally spread around the world from a lab in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=MacKenzie D |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7261 |title=Pandemic-causing 'Asian flu' accidentally released |date=13 April 2005 |work=New Scientist }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2005, scientists urgently called upon nations to prepare for a global influenza pandemic that could strike as much as 20% of the world's population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/may/25/birdflu |title=Flu pandemic 'could hit 20% of world's population' |publisher=guardian.co.uk |date=25 May 2005 | location=London | accessdate=May 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2005, cases of the avian flu (the deadly strain [[H5N1]]) were identified in [[Turkey]]. EU Health Commissioner Markos Kyprianou said: "We have received now confirmation that the virus found in Turkey is an avian flu H5N1 virus. There is a direct relationship with viruses found in Russia, Mongolia and China." Cases of bird flu were also identified shortly thereafter in [[Romania]], and then [[Greece]]. Possible cases of the virus have also been found in [[Croatia]], [[Bulgaria]] and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4348404.stm |title=Bird flu is confirmed in Greece |work=BBC NEWS |date=17 October 2005 | accessdate=2010-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By November 2007, numerous confirmed cases of the [[H5N1]] strain had been identified across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/world/05/bird_flu_map/html/1.stm |title=Bird Flu Map |work=BBC NEWS | accessdate=2010-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, by the end of October, only 59 people had died as a result of H5N1, which was atypical of previous influenza pandemics.

Avian flu cannot yet be categorized as a "pandemic", because the virus cannot yet cause sustained and efficient human-to-human transmission. Cases so far are recognized to have been transmitted from bird to human, but as of December 2006, there have been very few (if any) cases of proven human-to-human transmission.&lt;ref&gt;WHO (2005). Avian Influenza A (H5N1) Infection in Humans http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra052211&lt;/ref&gt; Regular influenza viruses establish infection by attaching to receptors in the throat and lungs, but the avian influenza virus can only attach to receptors located deep in the lungs of humans, requiring close, prolonged contact with infected patients, and thus limiting person-to-person transmission.

=== Zika virus ===
{{Main|Zika virus outbreak in the Americas (2015–present)|Zika virus|Zika fever}}
An outbreak of [[Zika virus]] began in 2015 and strongly intensified throughout the start of 2016, with over 1.5 million cases across more than a dozen countries in [[the Americas]]. The World Health Organisation warned that Zika had the potential to become an explosive global pandemic if the outbreak was not controlled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-35425731|title=Zika virus could become 'explosive pandemic'|date=28 January 2016|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic consequences of pandemic events ===
In 2016, the Commission on a Global Health Risk Framework for the Future estimated that pandemic disease events would cost the global economy over $6 trillion in the 21st century - over $60 billion per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nam.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Neglected-Dimension-of-Global-Security.pdf|title=Global Health Risk Framework - The Neglected Dimension of Global Security: A Framework to Counter Infectious Disease Crises|last=|first=|date=2016-01-16|website=|publisher=National Academy of Medicine|access-date=2016-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same report also recommended spending $4.5 billion annually on global prevention and response capabilities to reduce the threat posed by pandemic events.

== Biological warfare ==
{{Further|Biological warfare}}
In 1346, the bodies of Mongol warriors who had died of plague were thrown over the walls of the besieged [[Crimea]]n city of [[Caffa|Kaffa]] (now [[Feodosiya|Theodosia]]). After a protracted siege, during which the [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] army under [[Jani Beg]] was suffering the disease, they catapulted the infected corpses over the city walls to infect the inhabitants. It has been speculated that this operation may have been responsible for the arrival of the [[Black Death]] in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wheelis M |title=Biological Warfare at the 1346 Siege of Caffa |journal=Emerging Infect.

The [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] population was devastated after contact with the [[Old World]] by introduction of many fatal diseases. In a well documented case of germ warfare involving British commander [[Jeffery Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst|Jeffery Amherst]] and Swiss-British officer Colonel [[Henry Bouquet]], their correspondence included a proposal and agreement to give smallpox-infected blankets to Indians in order to "Extirpate this Execrable Race". During the [[siege of Fort Pitt]] late in the [[French and Indian War]], as recorded in his journal by sundries trader and militia Captain, [[William Trent]], on June 24, 1763, dignitaries from the Delaware tribe met with Fort Pitt officials, warned them of "great numbers of Indians" coming to attack the fort, and pleaded with them to leave the fort while there was still time. The commander of the fort refused to abandon the fort. Instead, the British gave as gifts two blankets, one silk handkerchief and one linen from the smallpox hospital to two Delaware Indian dignitaries.&lt;ref name="Fenn"&gt;Fenn, Elizabeth A.

During the [[Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945)|Sino-Japanese War]] (1937–1945), [[Unit 731]] of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] conducted [[Japanese war crimes#Human experimentation and biological warfare|human experimentation]] on thousands, mostly Chinese. In military campaigns, the Japanese army used biological weapons on Chinese soldiers and civilians. Plague fleas, infected clothing, and infected supplies encased in bombs were dropped on various targets. The resulting [[cholera]], [[anthrax]], and plague were estimated to have killed around 400,000 Chinese civilians.

Diseases considered for or known to be used as a weapon include [[anthrax]], [[ebola]], [[Marburg virus]], plague, [[cholera]], [[typhus]], [[Rocky Mountain spotted fever]], [[tularemia]], [[brucellosis]], [[Q fever]], [[machupo]], [[Coccidioides mycosis]], [[Glanders]], [[Melioidosis]], [[Shigella]], [[Psittacosis]], [[Japanese encephalitis|Japanese B encephalitis]], [[Rift Valley fever]], [[yellow fever]], and smallpox.&lt;ref name="Alibek"/&gt;

Spores of weaponized anthrax were accidentally released from a military facility near the Soviet [[closed city]] of [[Yekaterinburg|Sverdlovsk]] in 1979.

The '''Piccadilly Theatre''' in [[Rue Hamra]], [[Beirut]] was a major venue for concerts, musicals and plays in [[Lebanon]] during the 1960s and the 1970s.
Though it had a small number of seats (nearly 700), the Piccadilly was considered as a [[Very Important Person|VIP]] theatre in Lebanon, and the Middle-east.
The theatre closed down in the mid 1980s, soon after the beginning of the [[Lebanese civil war]] which lasted from 1975 until 1990. It was run by the Mamiche &amp; Itani company. 
Among the important artists who performed there:

[[Lebanon|Lebanese]] diva [[Fairuz]] (where she performed 9 of her musicals from 1967 until 1978), and the [[France|French]] diva [[Dalida]] (where she performed 4 concerts in it from 1971 until 1975).

Currently, the theatre is undertaking works of restoration and renovation for its reopening.

'''''The Low Road''''' is a 2013 play by the American playwright [[Bruce Norris (playwright)|Bruce Norris]]. It premiered from 23 March to 11 May 2013 at the [[Royal Court Theatre]]&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;{{cite web|author=Paul Taylor |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/reviews/the-low-road-royal-court-london-8553085.html |title=The Low Road, Royal Court, London - Reviews - Theatre &amp; Dance |publisher=The Independent |date=2013-03-28 |accessdate=2013-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[London]], in a production directed by [[Dominic Cooke]] (his final production as Artistic Director of that theatre) and with a cast including [[Bill Paterson (actor)|Bill Paterson]], [[Joe Flynn (UK actor)|Johnny Flynn]], [[Kobna-Holdbrook Smith]], [[Simon Paisley Day]], [[Elizabeth Berrington]], [[Ian Gelder]], [[Ellie Kendrick]] and [[John Ramm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/theatre-reviews/9959579/The-Low-Road-Royal-Court-review.html |title=The Low Road, Royal Court, review |publisher=Telegraph |date= |accessdate=2013-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Henry Hitchings |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/goingout/theatre/the-low-road-royal-court-downstairs--theatre-review-8552675.html |title=The Low Road, Royal Court Downstairs - theatre review - Theatre - Going Out - London Evening Standard |publisher=Standard.co.uk |date=2013-03-28 |accessdate=2013-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The play focuses on the economic theories of [[Adam Smith]], who acts as the narrator, first by showing us an 18th-century story in which Jim Trumpett, a young American of illegitimate birth and raised in a brothel, stumbles upon Smith's ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' and becomes a convert to the new theories of capitalism, and then showing us, through a contemporary scene featuring a [[G8 summit]], that our thinking hasn't changed at all. Theater critic Paul Taylor claims that the play was motivated by the [[2008 financial crisis]] and the failure of the banking community to change their behaviors.&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20434">'''The Toyota Way''' is a set of principles and behaviors that underlie the [[Toyota]] Motor Corporation's managerial approach and production system. Toyota first summed up its philosophy, values and manufacturing ideals in 2001, calling it "The Toyota Way 2001". It consists of  principles in two key areas: continuous improvement, and respect for people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Toyota Motor |title=Environmental &amp; Social Report 2003 |page=80 |url=http://www.toyota.co.jp/en/environmental_rep/03/pdf/E_p80.pdf |accessdate=26 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Toyota Motor Corporation Annual Report, 2003, page 19. "The Toyota Way, which has been passed down since the Companyʼs founding, is a unique set of values and manufacturing ideals. Clearly, our operations are going to become more and more globalized. With this in mind, we compiled a booklet, The Toyota Way 2001, in order to transcend the diverse languages and cultures of our employees and to communicate our philosophy to them." (Mr. Fujio Cho, President, Toyota Motor Corporation)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Toyota Motor |title=Sustainability Report 2009 |page=54 |url=http://www.toyota-global.com/sustainability/sustainability_report/pdf_file_download/09/pdf/sr09_p54_p59.pdf |accessdate=26 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview of the principles==
The Toyota Way has been called "a system designed to provide the tools for people to continually improve their work"&lt;ref name = "Exec sum" /&gt; The 14 principles of The Toyota Way are organized in four sections: 
# Long-Term Philosophy
# The Right Process Will Produce the Right Results
# Add Value to the Organization by Developing Your People
# Continuously Solving Root Problems Drives Organizational Learning
The two focal points of the principles are continuous improvement and respect for people. The principles for a continuous improvement include establishing a long-term vision, working on challenges, continual innovation, and going to the source of the issue or problem. The principles relating to respect for people include ways of building respect and teamwork.

==The 14 Principles==
The system can be summarized in 14 principles.&lt;ref name="The Toyota Way"&gt;{{cite book |last=Liker |first=Jeffrey K. |title=The Toyota Way: 14 Management Principles from the World's Greatest Manufacturer |year=2004 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn=978-0-07-139231-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The principles are set out and briefly described below:

===Section I — Long-Term Philosophy===
'''Principle 1'''
*''Base your management decisions on a long-term philosophy, even at the expense of short-term financial goals.''
People need purpose to find motivation and establish goals.

===Section II — The Right Process Will Produce the Right Results===
'''Principle 2'''
*''Create a continuous process flow to bring problems to the surface.''

Work processes are redesigned to eliminate waste ([[Muda (Japanese term)|muda]]) through the process of continuous improvement — [[kaizen]]. The seven types of muda are:
#Overproduction
#Waiting (time on hand)
#Unnecessary transport or conveyance
#Overprocessing or incorrect processing
#Excess inventory
#Motion
# Defects

'''Principle 3'''
*''Use "pull" systems to avoid overproduction.''

A method where a process signals its predecessor that more material is needed. The pull system produces only the required material after the subsequent operation signals a need for it. This process is necessary to reduce overproduction.

'''Principle 4'''
*''Level out the workload ([[heijunka]]). (Work like the tortoise, not the hare).''

This helps achieve the goal of minimizing waste ([[Muda (Japanese term)|muda]]), not overburdening people or the equipment ([[Muri (Japanese term)|muri]]), and not creating uneven production levels ([[Mura (Japanese term)|mura]]).

'''Principle 5'''
*''Build a culture of stopping to fix problems, to get quality right the first time.''

Quality takes precedence ([[Jidoka]]). Any employee in the [[Toyota Production System]] has the authority to stop the process to signal a quality issue.

'''Principle 6'''
*''Standardized tasks and processes are the foundation for continuous improvement and employee empowerment.''

Although Toyota has a bureaucratic system, the way that it is implemented allows for continuous improvement (kaizen) from the people affected by that system. It empowers the employee to aid in the growth and improvement of the company.

'''Principle 7'''
*''Use visual control so no problems are hidden.''

Included in this principle is the [[5S (methodology)|5S]] Program - steps that are used to make all work spaces efficient and productive, help people share work stations, reduce time looking for needed tools and improve the work environment.

*Sort: Sort out unneeded items
*Straighten: Have a place for everything
*Shine: Keep the area clean
*Standardize: Create rules and standard operating procedures
*Sustain: Maintain the system and continue to improve it

'''Principle 8'''
*''Use only reliable, thoroughly tested technology that serves your people and processes.''

Technology is '''pulled by''' manufacturing, not '''pushed to''' manufacturing.

===Section III — Add Value to the Organization by Developing Your People===
'''Principle 9'''
*''Grow leaders who thoroughly understand the work, live the philosophy, and teach it to others.''

Without constant attention, the principles will fade. The principles have to be ingrained, it must be the way one thinks. Employees must be educated and trained: they have to maintain a learning organization.

'''Principle 10'''
*''Develop exceptional people and teams who follow your company's philosophy.''

Teams should consist of 4-5 people and numerous management tiers. Success is based on the team, not the individual.

'''Principle 11'''
*''Respect your extended network of partners and suppliers by challenging them and helping them improve.''

Toyota treats suppliers much like they treat their employees, challenging them to do better and helping them to achieve it. Toyota provides cross functional teams to help suppliers discover and fix problems so that they can become a stronger, better supplier.

===Section IV — Continuously Solving Root Problems Drives Organizational Learning===
'''Principle 12'''
*''Go and see for yourself to thoroughly understand the situation ([[Genchi Genbutsu]]).''

Toyota managers are expected to "go-and-see" operations. Without experiencing the situation firsthand, managers will not have an understanding of how it can be improved. Furthermore, managers use Tadashi Yamashima's (President, Toyota Technical Center (TTC)) ten management principles as a guideline:

#Always keep the final target in mind.
#Clearly assign tasks to yourself and others.
#Think and speak on verified, proven information and data.
#Take full advantage of the wisdom and experiences of others to send, gather or discuss information. 
#Share information with others in a timely fashion.
#Always report, inform and consult in a timely manner.
#Analyze and understand shortcomings in your capabilities in a measurable way.
#Relentlessly strive to conduct [[kaizen]] activities.
#Think "outside the box," or beyond common sense and standard rules.
#Always be mindful of protecting your safety and health.

'''Principle 13'''
*''Make decisions slowly by consensus, thoroughly considering all options; implement decisions rapidly ([[nemawashi]]).''

The following are decision parameters:
#Find what is really going on (go-and-see) to test 
#Determine the underlying cause
#Consider a broad range of alternatives
#Build consensus on the resolution
#Use efficient communication tools

'''Principle 14'''
*''Become a learning organization through relentless reflection ([[hansei]]) and continuous improvement ([[kaizen]]).''

The process of becoming a learning organization involves criticizing every aspect of what one does. The general problem solving technique to determine the root cause of a problem includes:
#Initial problem perception
#Clarify the problem
#Locate area/point of cause
#[[Root cause analysis|Investigate root cause]] (5 whys)
#Countermeasure
#Evaluate
#Standardize

==Research findings==
In 2004, Dr. Jeffrey Liker, a [[University of Michigan]] professor of [[industrial engineering]], published ''The Toyota Way''. In his book Liker calls the Toyota Way "a system designed to provide the tools for people to continually improve their work."&lt;ref name = "Exec sum"&gt;{{cite web|last=Liker |first= Jeffrey |year=2004 |url=http://ICOS.groups.si.umich.edu//Liker04.pdf |title=The 14 Principles of the Toyota Way: An Executive Summary of the Culture Behind TPS|page=36 |publisher=University of Michigan |accessdate=26 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
According to Liker, the 14 principles of The Toyota Way are organized in four sections: (1) long-term philosophy, (2) the right process will produce the right results, (3) add value to the organization by developing your people, and (4) continuously solving root problems drives organizational learning.

===Long-term philosophy===
The first principle involves managing with a long-view rather than for short-term gain. It reflects a belief that people need purpose to find motivation and establish goals.

===Right process will produce right results===
The next seven principles are focused on process with an eye towards quality outcome. Following these principles, work processes are redesigned to eliminate waste ([[Muda (Japanese term)|muda]]) through the process of continuous improvement — [[kaizen]]. The seven types of muda are (1) overproduction; (2) waiting, time on hand; (3) unnecessary transport or conveyance; (4) overprocessing or incorrect processing; (5) excess inventory; (6) motion; and (7) defects.

The principles in this section empower employees in spite of the bureaucratic processes of Toyota, as any employee in the [[Toyota Production System]] has the authority to stop production to signal a quality issue, emphasizing that quality takes precedence ([[Jidoka]]). The way the Toyota bureaucratic system is implemented to allow for continuous improvement (kaizen) from the people affected by that system so that any employee may aid in the growth and improvement of the company.

Recognition of the value of employees is also part of the principle of measured production rate ([[heijunka]]), as a level workload helps avoid overburdening people and equipment ([[Muri (Japanese term)|muri]]), but this is also intended to minimize waste (muda) and avoid uneven production levels ([[Mura (Japanese term)|mura]]).

These principles are also designed to ensure that only essential materials are employed (to avoid overproduction), that the work environment is maintained efficiently (the [[5S (methodology)|5S]] Program) to help people share work stations and to reduce time looking for needed tools, and that the technology used is reliable and thoroughly tested.

===Value to organization by developing people===
Human development is the focus of principles 9 through 11. Principle 9 emphasizes the need to ensure that leaders embrace and promote the corporate philosophy. This reflects, according to Liker, a belief that the principles have to be ingrained in employees to survive. The 10th principle emphasizes the need of individuals and work teams to embrace the company's philosophy, with teams of 4-5 people who are judged in success by their team achievements, rather than their individual efforts. Principle 11 looks to business partners, who are treated by Toyota much like they treat their employees. Toyota challenges them to do better and helps them to achieve it, providing cross functional teams to help suppliers discover and fix problems so that they can become a stronger, better supplier.

===Solving root problems drives organizational learning===
The final principles embrace a philosophy of problem solving that emphasizes thorough understanding, [[consensus]]-based solutions swiftly implemented and continual reflection ([[hansei]]) and improvement ([[kaizen]]). The 12th principle ([[Genchi Genbutsu]]) sets out the expectation that managers will personally evaluate operations so that they have a firsthand understanding of situations and problems. Principle 13 encourages thorough consideration of possible solutions through a consensus process, with rapid implementation of decisions once reached ([[nemawashi]]). The final principle requires that Toyota be a "learning organization", continually reflecting on its practices and striving for improvement. According to Liker, the process of becoming a learning organization involves criticizing every aspect of what one does.

==Translating the principles==
There is a question of [[Diffusion (business)|uptake]] of the principles now that Toyota has production operations in many different countries around the world. As a ''New York Times'' article notes, while the corporate culture may have been easily disseminated by word of mouth when Toyota manufacturing was only in Japan, with worldwide production, many different [[culture]]s must be taken into account. Concepts such as "mutual ownership of problems", or ''"[[Genchi Genbutsu|genchi genbutsu]]"'', (solving problems at the source instead of behind desks), and the ''"[[kaizen]] mind"'', (an unending sense of crisis behind the company’s constant drive to improve), may be unfamiliar to North Americans and people of other cultures. A recent increase in vehicle recalls may be due, in part, to "a failure by Toyota to spread its obsession for craftsmanship among its growing ranks of overseas factory workers and managers." Toyota is attempting to address these needs by establishing training institutes in the United States and in Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fackler |first=Martin |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/15/business/worldbusiness/15toyota.html?pagewanted=all |title=The 'Toyota Way' Is Translated for a New Generation of Foreign Managers |newspaper=The New York Times |date=February 15, 2007 |accessdate=26 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8122">The '''traditional Chinese holidays''' are an essential part of harvests or prayer offerings. The most important Chinese holiday is the [[Chinese New Year]] (Spring Festival), which is also celebrated in Taiwan and overseas ethnic Chinese communities. All traditional holidays are scheduled according to the [[Chinese calendar]] (except the Qing Ming and Winter Solstice days, falling on the respective ''Jie qi'' in the Agricultural calendar).

==Public holidays==
Traditional holidays are generally celebrated in Chinese speaking regions. For the most part however, only [[Chinese New Year]], [[Qingming Festival]], the [[Dragon Boat Festival]] and [[Mid-Autumn Festival]] are statutory public holidays. This is the case in both mainland China and Taiwan whilst Hong Kong and Macau also observe [[Buddha's Birthday]] and [[Chung Yeung Festival]]. In Singapore, Chinese New Year is the only traditional Chinese public holiday likewise with [[Malaysia]]

Each region has its own holidays on top of this condensed traditional Chinese set. Mainland China and Taiwan observe patriotic holidays, Hong Kong and Macau observe Christian holidays, and Malaysia and Singapore celebrate Malay and Indian festivals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11534">'''Transformative social change''' is a philosophical, practical and strategic process to affect revolutionary change within society, i.e., [[social transformation]]. It is effectively a [[systems approach]] applied to broad-based [[social change]] and [[social justice]] efforts to catalyze sociocultural, socioeconomic and political [[revolution]]. In seeking to integrate and then politicize [[personal development]] and [[social development]] as an overarching approach to social change at multiple levels, addressing a wide range of issues, using holistic, nonviolent methods,&lt;ref&gt;[http://sites.google.com/a/deepchangegathering.org/home/ Deep Change Gathering: ''Transforming the Practice of Social Justice'', Gathering, [[Asheville]], NC, June 5–7, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; it may be best classified as a [[new social movement]]. Rather than focus on particular issue(s), it seeks to impact the culture of left of center social movement and organizing work. However, by considering the dismantling of and liberation from oppressive systems, including economic, as core to its goal, it defies even definitions put forth for new social movements. As a comprehensive approach to progressive social change, it seeks distinguishes to itself from the "ordinary" change of conventional social change, social justice and their respective organizing practices by placing emphasis on personal, organizational and social systemic change that cannot be undone, or "deep change".

==Definitions and components==
A key premise defining transformative social change is that "the ends of justice can never be served by the means of injustice, even when the injustice is as subtle as the mental framework instilled by the quest for liberation.("Change vs. Transformation" by [[Angel Kyodo Williams]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last =Williams| first =Angel Kyodo| authorlink =Angel Kyodo Williams|author2=Gass, Robert |author3=Horwitz, Claudia |author4=Vega-Frey, Jesse |author5=Maina, Ng'ethe |author6=Haines, Staci K. |author7= Movement Strategy Center | title =Framing Deep Change: Essays on Transformative Social Change| publisher =Third Way Press| year =2010| location =| pages =4| url =http://issuu.com/xsochange/docs/framingdeepchange| doi =| id = | isbn = 978-0-9828845-0-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams further proposes that "because suffering cannot be alleviated by instigating suffering"; the conditions under which social justice activists and seekers operate within organizationally need to exemplify the conditions they wish to ultimately see cultivated within society at large. This ideal coincides with the quote often attributed to but not said by [[Gandhi]], "You must be the change you wish to see in the world."&lt;ref&gt;[[q:Mahatma Gandhi|"Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi" Wikiquote]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/30/opinion/falser-words-were-never-spoken.html|title=''Falser Words Were Never Spoken''
|first= Brian|last=Morton |date=August 29, 2011 |work=NY Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seeking to better define and cohere the emerging and evolving work of transformative social change, a People's Movement Assembly process was held at the 2010 [[US Social Forum]] in [[Detroit]], Michigan, in which the following framework for defining transformation was agreed to by way of resolution:

~Transformation, as applied to social change, is a process through which who we are – individually or collectively – is changed so deeply that the following are altered:
* identity (way of seeing/thinking/reflecting upon ourselves and environment),
* emotions (range of feelings and reactivity,)
* embodiment (relationship and connectedness to and within our bodies and how we show up,)
* actions (behaviors, patterned responses,)
* creativity (capacity for responsiveness and ability to access resources,) and
* paradigms (overall perspective and mode of operating.)

Further, the work of transformation requires the following components:
* Awareness of the default conditioning, habits and reactions in our individual, organizational and movement experience.
* Appreciation of old identities and states as they pass away and an understanding of the experience of crisis, breakdown, “undone-ness,” or “not-knowing” as a necessary catalyst that moves us toward new identities and states. People and entities can and must be supported in these periods.
*  A container at the individual, organizational and movement levels; practices that support the process, and a commitment to mentoring people into the necessary skills and processes.
* A sustainable relationship with the whole web of life.

~ Transformation can and does consist of multi-disciplinary practices, modalities and paths, but overall it points toward the centrality of consistent, rigorous practice capable of undoing conditioning. Such a practice must effect systemic changes, internal and external. We refer to the broad spectrum of varied modalities as transformative practices.

~ Transformation happens in its own time and it can’t be undone. We expect processes of transformation, as distinct from change, to be inclined towards being irreversible.

~ In the transformation process, one identity or self passes away and a new, radically altered one emerges. The new way of being is more integrated, resourceful and aligned. This is apparent to others in your presence, your actions and your increased capacity to respond based on vision, rather than reaction. This process repeats itself and deepens through continued engagement in transformative practices and processes. The old, previous “form” sheds again and new emerges again.

~ The methods and philosophy of transformation must be rooted in an explicit analysis of oppression.
&lt;br /&gt;
~ We recognize that this work is grounded in ancient wisdom, lineages and history, and that it is entering a new phase of coherence that allows us to move forward.

==Influences==
Transformative social change is influenced by the work of social movements led by individuals that are viewed as attending to both their personal or spiritual development as well as systemic social issues because of the "realization that action is not enough":&lt;ref&gt;[http://seasonsfund.org/?page_id=16 Seasons Fund website]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, scholars Raymond Allen Morrow and Carlos Alberto Torres used the phrase ''transformative social change'' as part of the subtitle in their book ''Reading Freire and Habermas: Critical Pedagogy and Transformative Social Change''&lt;ref&gt;''Reading Freire and Habermas: Critical Pedagogy and Transformative Social Change'', Teachers College Press, 2002, {{ISBN|0-8077-4202-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a term to convey the intersection between [[Paulo Freire]]'s [[critical pedagogy]] and [[Jürgen Habermas]]' critical social theory, and the implications those convergences have for educational practice. However, the term is never specifically defined in the book, nor is any distinct theory set 

The phrase is being applied{{By whom|date=May 2016}} as a social change field and movement in which developing inner awareness and nurturing one's inner life, i.e., personal development, is seen as essential in effective social justice work. This is taken to mean from an aligned, sustainable, and nonviolent place. It seeks to operationalize, in practical terms, the ideal of embodiment of the future desired state, in other words, to actualize [[Gandhi]]'s exhortation to "be the change."

While transformative social change has evolved to include secular practices with no specific spiritual ties, its emphasis on collective liberation shares history, principles and proponents with spiritual activism and liberation spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Horwitz &amp; Jesse Maceo Vega-Frey (2006). [http://www.berkana.org/articles/spiritual_activism.htm ''Spiritual Activism and Liberation Spirituality: Pathways To Collective Liberation'']&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, it shares principles of [[transformative learning]] and [[transformative justice]], Examples of "transformative practice" include: yoga, meditation, centering prayer, tai chi, forward stance and types of somatic practices.

Transformative community organizing is being taught in university courses, in fields such as social work, community health, sociology, and other service learning classes.  Scholars such as Loretta Pyles have offered a transformative organizing framework, grounded in feminist social change work, and affirming a practice of collective and self-inquiry based on meditative traditions and social movement practices, such as popular education.&lt;ref&gt;Pyles, L. (2014).

A '''tunnel washer''', also called a '''continuous batch washer''', is an industrial [[washing machine]] designed specifically to handle heavy loads of [[laundry]].

The screw is made of perforated metal, so items can progress through the washer in one direction, while water and washing chemicals move through in the opposite direction.  Thus, the linen moves through pockets of progressively cleaner water and fresher chemicals.  Soiled linen can be continuously fed into one end of the tunnel while clean linen emerges from the other.

Originally, one of the machine's major drawbacks was the necessity of using one wash formula for all items.  Modern [[Embedded computer|computerized]] tunnel washers can monitor and adjust the chemical levels in individual pockets, effectively overcoming this problem.
