The '''A51''' is a road in [[England]] running from [[Chester]] to [[Kingsbury, Warwickshire|Kingsbury]], Warwickshire.

It takes on the following route:
*[[Chester]]
*[[Vicars Cross]]
*[[Littleton, Cheshire|Littleton]]
*[[Tarvin]]
*[[Duddon]]
*[[Clotton]]
*[[Tarporley]] (merges briefly with [[A49 road|A49]])
*[[Nantwich]]
*[[Woore]]
*[[Stone, Staffordshire|Stone]] (merges briefly with [[A34 road (England)|A34]])
*[[Sandon, Staffordshire|Sandon]]
*[[Weston, Staffordshire|Weston]]
*[[Great Haywood]]
*[[Little Haywood]]
*[[Rugeley]] (bypass opened 2007 [https://web.archive.org/web/20081121000416/http://www.rugeleybypass.co.uk/])
*[[Lichfield]]
*[[Tamworth, Staffordshire|Tamworth]]
*[[Kingsbury, Warwickshire|Kingsbury]]

The A51 is used by some long-distance traffic as an alternative to the [[M6 motorway]], which is prone to congestion through [[Birmingham]]. The nearby [[M6 Toll]] motorway now serves a similar function.

An '''adatom''' is an [[atom]] that lies on a [[crystal]] surface, and can be thought of as the opposite of a surface [[vacancy (chemistry)|vacancy]]. This term is used in [[surface chemistry]] and [[epitaxy]], when describing single atoms lying on surfaces and [[surface roughness]].  The word is a [[portmanteau]] of "[[adsorption|adsorbed]] atom".  A single atom, a cluster of atoms, or a molecule or [[molecular cluster|cluster of molecules]] may all be referred to by the general term "[[adparticle]]".  This is often a thermodynamically unfavorable state. However, cases such as [[graphene]] may provide counter-examples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Epitaxy: Physical Principles and Technical Implementation |author1=Marian A. Herman |author2=Wolfgang Richter |author3=Helmut Sitter |publisher=Springer |year=2004 |isbn=3-540-67821-2 |page=322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
In 2012, scientists at the [[University of New South Wales]] were able to use [[phosphine]] to precisely, deterministically eject a single [[silicon]] atom onto a surface of [[epitaxy|epitaxial]] silicon. This resulting adatom created what is described as a [[single-atom transistor]].  Thus, inasmuch as chemical empirical formulas pinpoint the locations of branching ions that are attached to a particular molecule, the dopant of silicon based transistors and other such electronic components will have the location identified of each dopant atom or molecule, along with the associated characteristic of the device based on the named locations.  Thus, the mapping of the dopant substances will give exact characteristics of any given [[semiconductor device]], once all is known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Fuechsle | first1 = Martin | last2 = Miwa | first2 = Jill A. | last3 = Mahapatra | first3 = Suddhasatta  | last4 = Ryu | first4 = Hoon | title = A single-atom transistor | publisher = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | date = February 19, 2012  | url = http://www.nature.com/nnano/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nnano.2012.21.html#/main | accessdate = February 20, 2012 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16490">In [[control theory (sociology)|control theory]], '''affect control theory''' proposes that individuals maintain [[affect (psychology)|affective]] meanings through their actions and interpretations of events. The activity of social institutions occurs through maintenance of culturally based affective meanings.

==Affective meaning==
Besides a denotative meaning, every concept has an affective meaning, or [[connotation]], that varies along three dimensions:&lt;ref&gt;Osgood ''et al.'' (1975).&lt;/ref&gt; evaluation – goodness versus badness, potency – powerfulness versus powerlessness, and activity – liveliness versus torpidity. Affective meanings can be measured with [[semantic differential]]s yielding a three-number profile indicating how the concept is positioned on evaluation, potency, and activity (EPA). Osgood&lt;ref&gt;Osgood ''et al.'' (1975).&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated that an elementary concept conveyed by a word or idiom has a normative affective meaning within a particular culture.

A stable affective meaning derived either from personal experience or from cultural inculcation is called a sentiment, or fundamental affective meaning, in affect control theory. Affect control theory has inspired assembly of dictionaries of EPA sentiments for thousands of concepts involved in social life – identities, behaviors, settings, personal attributes, and emotions. Sentiment dictionaries have been constructed with ratings of respondents from the US, [[Canada]], [[Northern Ireland]], Germany, [[Japan]], and China (both the People's Republic and Taiwan).&lt;ref&gt;Heise (2001) provides a detailed description of this work.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impression formation==
{{main|Impression formation}}
Each concept that is in play in a situation has a transient affective meaning in addition to an associated sentiment. The transient corresponds to an impression created by recent events.&lt;ref&gt;Gollob (1968); Gollob and Rossman (1973).&lt;/ref&gt;

Events modify impressions on all three EPA dimensions in complex ways that are described with [[non-linear]] equations obtained through empirical studies.&lt;ref&gt;See Heise (1979), Ch. 2; Smith-Lovin &amp; Heise (1988); Britt &amp; Heise (1992); Smith ''et al.'' (1994); Smith &amp; Francis (2005); and Schröder (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; 

Here are two examples of impression-formation processes. 
* An actor who behaves disagreeably seems less good, especially if the object of the behavior is innocent and powerless, like a child.
* A powerful person seems desperate when performing extremely forceful acts on another, and the object person may seem invincible.

A social action creates impressions of the actor, the object person, the behavior, and the setting.&lt;ref&gt;Smith-Lovin &amp; Heise (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deflections===
Deflections are the distances in the EPA space between transient and fundamental affective meanings. For example, a mother complimented by a stranger feels that the unknown individual is much nicer than a stranger is supposed to be, and a bit too potent and active as well – thus there is a moderate distance between the impression created and the mother's sentiment about strangers. High deflections in a situation produce an aura of unlikeliness or uncanniness.&lt;ref&gt;Heise &amp; MacKinnon (1987).&lt;/ref&gt; It is theorized that  high deflections maintained over time generate psychological stress.&lt;ref&gt;Heise (2007), pp. 60-62.&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic [[cybernetic]] idea of affect control theory can be stated in terms of deflections. An individual selects a behavior that produces the minimum deflections for concepts involved in the action. Minimization of deflections is described by equations derived with calculus from empirical impression-formation equations.&lt;ref&gt;Heise (2007), Part II.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Action==
On entering a scene an individual defines the situation by assigning identities to each participant, frequently in accord with an encompassing social institution.&lt;ref&gt;Heise (2007), Ch. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; While defining the situation, the individual tries to maintain the affective meaning of self through adoption of an identity whose sentiment serves as a surrogate for the individual's self-sentiment.&lt;ref&gt;Heise (2007), Chs. 10, 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The identities assembled in the definition of the situation determine the sentiments that the individual tries to maintain behaviorally.

Confirming sentiments associated with institutional identities – like doctor–patient, lawyer–client, or professor–student – creates institutionally relevant [[role]] behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Heise (1979), Ch. 5; MacKinnon (1994), Ch. 6; Heise (2007), Ch. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Confirming sentiments associated with negatively evaluated identities – like bully, glutton, loafer, or scatterbrain – generates [[deviance (sociology)|deviant behavior]].&lt;ref&gt;Heise (1979), pp. 118–124; Heise (2007), pp. 53–55.&lt;/ref&gt;
Affect control theory's sentiment databases and mathematical model are combined in a computer simulation program&lt;ref&gt;Schneider and Heise (1995).&lt;/ref&gt; for analyzing [[social interaction]] in various cultures.

==Emotions==
According to affect control theory, an event generates [[emotion]]s for the individuals involved in the event by changing impressions of the individuals. The emotion is a function of the impression created of the individual and of the difference between that impression and the sentiment attached to the individual's identity&lt;ref&gt;Averett and Heise (1987); Heise and Weir (1999); Heise (2007), Chs. 8, 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, for example, an event that creates a negative impression of an individual generates unpleasant emotion for that person, and the unpleasantness is worse if the individual believes she has a highly valued identity. Similarly, an event creating a positive impression generates a pleasant emotion, all the more pleasant if the individual believes he has a disvalued identity in the situation.

Non-linear equations describing how transients and fundamentals combine to produce emotions have been derived in empirical studies&lt;ref&gt;Averett &amp; Heise (1988); Heise &amp; Thomas (1989); Schröder (2011); Smith ''et al.'' (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Affect control theory's computer simulation program&lt;ref&gt;Heise (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; uses these equations to predict emotions that arise in social interaction, and displays the predictions via [[facial expressions]] that are computer drawn,&lt;ref&gt;Heise (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in terms of emotion words.

Based on cybernetic studies by Pavloski&lt;ref&gt;Pavloski (1989).&lt;/ref&gt; and Goldstein,&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein (1989).&lt;/ref&gt; that utilise [[perceptual control theory]], Heise&lt;ref&gt;Heise (2007), p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; hypothesizes that emotion is distinct from stress. For example, a parent enjoying intensely pleasant emotions while interacting with an offspring suffers no stress. A homeowner attending to a sponging house guest may feel no emotion and yet be experiencing substantial stress.

==Interpretations==
Others' behaviors are interpreted so as to minimize the deflections they cause.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a man turning away from another and exiting through a doorway could be engaged in several different actions, like departing from, deserting, or escaping from the other. Observers choose among the alternatives so as to minimize deflections associated with their definitions of the situation. Observers who assigned different identities to the observed individuals could have different interpretations of the behavior.

Re-definition of the situation may follow an event that causes large deflections which cannot be resolved by reinterpreting the behavior. In this case, observers assign new identities that are confirmed by the behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Heise (1979), pp. 86–89, 127–132; MacKinnon (1994), Ch. 8; Heise (2007), Chs. 9, 13.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, seeing a father slap a son, one might re-define the father as an abusive parent, or perhaps as a strict disciplinarian; or one might re-define the son as an arrogant brat. Affect control theory's computer program predicts the plausible re-identifications, thereby providing a formal model for [[labeling theory]].

The sentiment associated with an identity can change to befit the kinds of events in which that identity is involved, when situations keep arising where the identity is deflected in the same way, especially when identities are informal and non-institutionalized.&lt;ref&gt;Heise (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Affect control theory has been used in research on emotions, gender, social structure, politics, deviance and law, the arts, and business. A bibliography of research studies in these areas is provided by [[David R. Heise]]&lt;ref&gt;Heise (2007), Chapter 19.&lt;/ref&gt; and at the research program's website.

==Extensions==
A probabilistic and decision theoretic extension of affect control theory&lt;ref&gt;Hoey, Alhothali, and Schroeder (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; generalizes the original theory in order to allow for uncertainty about identities, changing identities, and explicit non-affective goals.

This article deals with music software created for the Amiga line of computers and covers the [[AmigaOS]] operating system and its derivates [[AROS]] and [[MorphOS]] and is a split of main article [[Amiga software]].
See also related articles [[Amiga productivity software]], [[Amiga programming languages]], [[Amiga Internet and communications software]] and [[Amiga support and maintenance software]] for other information regarding software that run on Amiga.

&lt;!--== History ==
[[hHis section to be developed]]

== Characteristics ==
[This section to be developed]--&gt;

== Noteworthy Amiga music software ==
[[Instant Music (software)|Instant Music]], [[Deluxe Music Construction Set|DMCS]] (DeLuxe Music) 1 and 2, [[Music-X]], [[TigerCub]], [[Dr. T's KCS]], [[Dr. T's Midi Recording Studio]], [[Bars and Pipes]] (from [[Blue Ribbon Soundworks]], a firm which was bought from [[Microsoft]] and it is now part of its group. Bars and Pipes internal structure then inspired to create audio streaming data passing of [[DirectX]] libraries), AEGIS [[Audio Master]], [[Pro Sound Designer]], AEGIS [[Sonix]], [[Audio Sculpture]], [[Audition 4]] from [[SunRize Industries]], [[SuperJAM!]], [[HD-Rec]], [[Audio Evolution]], [[RockBEAT]] [[drum machine]] and various [[MIDI]] [[Music sequencer|sequencing]] programs by [[Gajits Music Software]].

===Audio Digitizers Software===
Together with the well known Dr. T's Midi Recording Studio, Pro Sound Designer, Sonix, [[SoundFX]], Audition 4, HD-Rec, and Audio Evolution, there were also lots of Amiga software to pilot digitzers such as [[GVP DSS8 Plus]] 8bit audio sampler/digitizer for Amiga, [[Sunrize]] [[Sunrize AD512|AD512]] and [[Sunrize AD516|AD516]] professional 12 and 16-bit DSP sound cards for the Amiga that included [[Studio-16]] as standard software, [[Soundstage Amiga Soundcard|Soundstage]] professional 20-bit DSP expansion sound card for the Amiga, [[Aura (sampler)|Aura]] 12-bit sound sampler which is connected to the [[PC Card|PCMCIA]] port of [[Amiga 600]] and [[Amiga 1200]] models, and the [[Concierto]] 16-bit sound card optional module to be added to the Picasso IV graphic card, etcetera.

=== Sound design / SoftSynth ===
[[Synthia (software)|Synthia]], FMSynth by Christian Stiens (inspired by Yamaha's FM-operating DX Series), [[Assampler]], SoundFX (a.k.a. SFX), [[WaveTracer]] and Gajits' CM-Panion and 4D Companion patch editors.

== Mod music file format ==
Starting from 1987 with the release of [[Ultimate Soundtracker|Soundtracker]], trackers became a new type of music programs which spawned the mod ([[Module file|module]]) audio file standard. The Mod audio standard is considered the audio format that started it all in the world of computer music. After Soundtracker many clones (which often were reverse engineered and improved) appeared, including [[Noisetracker]], [[Startrekker]], [[Protracker]]. Also many deratives appeared, amongst which [[OctaMED]] and [[Oktalyzer]].

In the period from 1985 to 1995 when Amiga audio (which was standard in Amiga computers) was of greater quality than other standard home computers, PC compatible systems began to be equipped with 8-bit audio cards inserted into 16 bit ISA bus slots. Soundtracker Module files were used on PC computers and were considered the only serious 8bit audio standard for creating music. The worldwide usage of these programs led to the creation of the so-called MOD-scene which was considered part of the [[demoscene]]. Eventually the PC world evolved to 16-bit audio cards, and Mod files were slowly abandoned. Various Amiga and PC games (such as [[Worms (1994 video game)|Worms]]) supported Mod as their internal standard for generating music and audio effects.

Some trackers can use both sampled sounds and can synthesize sounds. AHX and [[Hively Tracker]] are special trackers in that they can't use samples, but can synthesize the sound created by Commodore 64 computers.

Some modern Amiga trackers are [[DigiBooster Pro]] and Hively Tracker.

Development of popular Amiga tracker OctaMED SoundStudio was handed over to a third party several times{{Ref label|KatoDev|1}} but the first two parties failed to produce useful results{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}. A third attempt at creating an update will be undertaken by the current developer of Bars 'n Pipes{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}.

===MOD filetype evolution===
Initially trackers (and the mod format) were limited to 4 channel, 8-bit audio (due to restrictions of the built-in soundchip) and 15 (and later 31) sampled instruments. By using software mixing some trackers achieved 6, 7 or 8 channel sound at the cost of CPU time and audio quality.
Modern trackers can handle 128+ channel, 16-bit audio quality and can often handle up to 256 instruments. Some even support software synthesizer plugins as instruments{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}.

==Speech synthesis==
The original Amiga was launched with [[speech synthesis]] software, developed by [[Softvoice, Inc.]] (see: [http://www.text2speech.com/#aboutsv Text2Speech System]). This could be broken into three main components: ''narrator.device'', which could enunciate [[phoneme]]s expressed as [[ARPABET]], ''translator.library'' which could translate English text to American English phonemes, and the ''SPEAK:'' handler, which any application including the command-line could redirect output to, to have it spoken.  Reading ''SPEAK:'' as it is producing speech will return two numbers which are the size ratio of the width and height of a mouth producing the phoneme being spoken{{Ref label|Speech|2}}.

In the original 1.x releases, a ''Say'' program demo was included with [[AmigaBASIC]] programming examples. From the 2.05 release on, ''narrator.device'' and ''translator.library'' were no longer present in the operating system but could still be used if copied over from older disks.

The speak handler was not just a curiosity, or a gorgeous demonstration of capabilities of Amiga. In fact, the word processor [[ProWrite]] since its version 3.2 was able to read an entire document using the speech synthesizer for the benefit of blind users.

Zipay|author4= Scott Cryan|date=5 March 2016|publisher=NASA|accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; are used interchangeably to describe a family of [[spacecraft docking mechanism]]s, and are also sometimes used as a generic name for any docking system in that family. A system similar to APAS-89/95 is used by the Chinese [[Shenzhou spacecraft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Testimony of James Oberg: Senate Science, Technology, and Space Hearing: International Space Exploration Program|url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=12687|publisher=spaceref.com|accessdate=2008-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The name of the system is Russian in origin, and is an acronym, АПАС, in the Cyrillic alphabet, from the Russian, ''Андрогинно-периферийный агрегат стыковки''. The English acronym was designed to be just the same letters but in the Latin alphabet, for which the first two words are direct counterparts of those in the original. The third word in Russian comes from the German ''Aggregat'', meaning "complicated mechanism", and the last means "docking". The last two words in the English name were picked to begin with the same equivalent letters as in the Russian name.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

The idea behind the design is that unlike with the [[probe-and-drogue docking system]], any APAS docking ring can mate with any other APAS docking ring; both sides are ''[[androgynous]]''. In each docking there is an active and a passive side, but both sides can fulfill either role. There are three basic variations of the APAS system.

===APAS-75===
[[Image:APAS-75 image cropped and rotated.jpg|thumb|APAS-75 (American version)]]
Co-developed by American and Soviet engineers through a series of in-person meetings, letters and teleconferences, APAS-75 was initially planned to be used on an American mission to a [[Salyut programme|Salyut space station]] which instead became the [[Apollo–Soyuz Test Project]] (ASTP).&lt;ref name=ApInMos/&gt; There were differences between the American and Soviet version of the docking mechanism, but they were still mechanically compatible. Early on, the Americans called the device both the International Rendezvous and Docking Mission (IRDM) Docking Mechanism and the International Docking System.&lt;ref name=IntDodckSys&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/SP-4209/ch6-5.htm|title= SP-4209 The Partnership: A History of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project: An International Docking System|author1=Edward Clinton Ezell |author2=Linda Neuman Ezell |date=1978|publisher=NASA|accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The device is called the Androgynous Peripheral Docking System (APDS) in the NASA press packet for ASTP.&lt;ref name=ASTPPKIT/&gt;

====Design====
Unlike previous docking systems, either APAS-75 unit could assume the active or passive role as required. For docking, the spade-shaped guides of the extended active unit (right) and the retracted passive unit (left) interacted for gross alignment. The ring holding the guides shifted to align the active unit latches with the passive unit catches. After these caught, shock absorbers dissipated residual impact energy in the American unit; mechanical attenuators served the same function on the Soviet side. The active unit then retracted to bring the docking collars together. Guides and sockets in the docking collars completed alignment. Four spring push rods drove the spacecraft apart at undocking.&lt;ref name="mir-hardware-heritage"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ston.jsc.nasa.gov/collections/TRS/_techrep/RP1357.pdf |title=Mir Hardware Heritage |author=David S. F. Portree |publisher=''[[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center]]'' |accessdate=2008-04-05 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410040836/http://ston.jsc.nasa.gov/collections/TRS/_techrep/RP1357.pdf |archivedate=10 April 2008 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Americans selected [[North American Rockwell]] to construct seven docking mechanisms (two flight, four test, and one spare).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4209/ch6-6.htm|title= SP-4209 The Partnership: A History of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project: Estimating the Costs of a Mission|author1=Edward Clinton Ezell |author2=Linda Neuman Ezell |date=1978|publisher=NASA|accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russia built five [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz]] spacecraft that used APAS-75. The first three flew as test systems ([[Cosmos 638]], [[Cosmos 672]] and [[Soyuz 16]]). One was used for the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, [[Soyuz 19]] the only Soyuz to actually use the docking system, and the last one flew as [[Soyuz 22]]. On the American side the ASTP Docking Module carried one APAS-75 docking collar and one Apollo docking collar.

====Development====
In April 1970 NASA Administrator [[Thomas O. Paine]] suggested, in an informal meeting with Russian academician [[Anatoli Blagonravov]] in New York, that the two nations cooperate on astronaut safety, including compatible docking equipment on space stations and spacecraft to permit rescue operations in space emergencies.&lt;ref name="NASAName"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4402/ch4.htm|title=Origins of NASA Names: Manned SpaceFlight|author1=Helen T.

Engineer Caldwell Johnson proposed a ring and cone system during a meeting in Moscow during October 1970.&lt;ref name="StudyTask"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/SP-4209/ch5-8.htm|title=SP-4209 The Partnership: A History of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project: A Study Task Team|author1=Edward Clinton Ezell |author2=Linda Neuman Ezell |date=1978|publisher=NASA|access-date=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boris N. Petrov rejected the simple adaptation of Apollo and Soyuz as a "space stunt" and had proposed developing a universal docking mechanism, Johnson suggested that the [[Johnson Space Center|Manned Spacecraft Center]] (MSC) draw up a "design specifically adequate to requirements of a particular CSM/Salyut mission, the design being representative only of the fundamental form and function of docking gear satisfying the requirements for compatible docking system for future spacecraft."&lt;ref name="StudyTask" /&gt;

During a meeting in Houston during June 1971, Soviet docking specialist Valentin N. Bobkov indicated that the Soviets also favored some version of the double ring and cone.&lt;ref name="IntDodckSys" /&gt; Bobkov illustrated through sketches that the overall diameter of the docking system could not exceed 1.3 meters, because any larger system would require a change in the launch shroud.&lt;ref name="IntDodckSys" /&gt; When Johnson raised the question of altering the shroud, the Soviets stressed the major impact that such a modification would have.&lt;ref name="IntDodckSys" /&gt; In addition to having to design a new shroud, they would have to test out the launch aerodynamics of the altered hardware.&lt;ref name="IntDodckSys" /&gt; The Americans had hoped to argue for a larger tunnel, but such a change appeared to be too great for their counterparts.&lt;ref name="IntDodckSys" /&gt;

[[File:Early concept for APAS-75.jpg|thumbnail|Drawing of a four-guide docking system that NASA proposed to the Soviets during a November 1971 meeting in Moscow]]
After the June meetings, Johnson had put Bill Creasy and his mechanical designers to work on the preliminary design of a docking mechanism.&lt;ref name="IntDodckSys" /&gt; By the time the NASA delegation left for Moscow, Creasy's crew had designed and built a 1-meter double ring and cone docking system that had four guide fingers and attenuators on both rings, so either half could be active or passive during docking.&lt;ref name="IntDodckSys" /&gt; The Structures and Mechanics Laboratory at MSC made 16-millimeter movies demonstrating this system in action, which Johnson took to Moscow in November, along with a booklet describing the system and a model of the capture latches.&lt;ref name="IntDodckSys" /&gt; To Johnson's surprise, [[Vladimir Syromyatnikov]] had been working on a variation of NASA's ring and cone concept since the previous October.&lt;ref name="IntDodckSys" /&gt; Instead of the four guide fingers in the American proposal, Syromyatnikov suggested three, and in lieu of hydraulic shock-absorbers, he proposed electromechanical attenuators.&lt;ref name="IntDodckSys" /&gt; In essence, the Soviets had accepted the idea of using a set of intermeshing fingers to guide the two halves of the docking gear from the point of initial contact to capture.&lt;ref name="IntDodckSys" /&gt; The concept of using shock absorbing attenuators on the active spacecraft's capture ring to buffer the impact of two spacecraft coming together was also acceptable.&lt;ref name="IntDodckSys" /&gt; Both groups of engineers planned to retract the active half of the docking gear using an electrically powered winch to reel in a cable.&lt;ref name="IntDodckSys" /&gt; Once retracted, structural or body latches would be engaged to lock the two ships together. Three basic issues had to be resolved&amp;nbsp;— the number of guides, the type of attenuators, and the type of structural latches&amp;nbsp;— before the design of a universal system could proceed.&lt;ref name="IntDodckSys" /&gt;

Johnson, Creasy, and the other engineers in the Spacecraft Design Division had wanted to use four guides because they believed that it provided the best geometry when using hydraulic attenuators.&lt;ref name="IntDodckSys" /&gt; As Bill Creasy subsequently explained it, the most probable failure situation using hydraulic attenuators would be a leak that would cause one shock absorber to collapse on impact.&lt;ref name="IntDodckSys" /&gt; A study of various combinations had led the MSC specialists to conclude that four guides and eight shock absorbers was the optimum design.&lt;ref name="IntDodckSys" /&gt; Creasy pointed out too that the most likely trouble with an electromechanical system would be a freeze-up or binding of one of the pairs of attenuators.&lt;ref name="IntDodckSys" /&gt; Thus, the Soviets had sought to minimize the number of pairs in their system for the same reason that the Americans had preferred a larger number to limit the probability of something going wrong.&lt;ref name="IntDodckSys" /&gt;

Since the United States had no significant engineering or hardware equity in its proposed design, and since the USSR had considerable equity in its proposed design, the Soviet design was selected as a baseline for the next phase of study.&lt;ref name="IntDodckSys" /&gt;

By the end of the November–December meeting, the two teams had signed a set of minutes outlining the basic concept for a universal androgynous docking system.&lt;ref name="IntDodckSys" /&gt; The formal statement read, "The design concept includes a ring equipped with guides and capture latches that were located on movable rods which serve as attenuators and retracting actuators, and a docking ring on which are located peripheral mating capture latches with a docking seal."&lt;ref name="IntDodckSys" /&gt; Basic information on shapes and dimensions of the guides were also included in the minutes.&lt;ref name="IntDodckSys" /&gt; They were to be solid and not rodlike; as first proposed by the Soviets, and three in number.&lt;ref name="IntDodckSys" /&gt; As long as the requirement for absorbing docking forces was met, each side was free to execute the actual attenuator design as it best saw fit.&lt;ref name="IntDodckSys" /&gt; The Soviets planned to use an electromechanical approach designed for the Soyuz docking probe, and the Americans proposed to stick with hydraulic shock absorbers similar to those used on the Apollo probe.&lt;ref name="IntDodckSys" /&gt; This proposal also called for developing docking gear that could be used in either an active or passive mode; when one ship's system was active, the other would be passive.&lt;ref name="IntDodckSys" /&gt;

Looking into the detailed design of the mechanism, the two sides had further agreed that the capture latches would follow the design developed at MSC and the structural latches and ring would follow the Soviet pattern.&lt;ref name="IntDodckSys" /&gt; These paired sets of hooks had been successfully used on both Soyuz and Salyut.&lt;ref name="IntDodckSys" /&gt; In addition, the group concurred on details regarding the alignment pins, spring thrusters (to assist in the separation of the spacecraft at undocking), and electrical connector locations.&lt;ref name="IntDodckSys" /&gt; To evaluate the docking system concept and to ensure the establishment of compatibility at an early point in the development, the men planned to build a two-fifths-scale test model, the exact details of which would be decided at the next joint meeting.&lt;ref name="IntDodckSys" /&gt;

Upon his return to Houston, Caldwell Johnson prepared a memorandum to document some of the informal understandings reached in Moscow.&lt;ref name="IntDodckSys" /&gt; He indicated that this reflected "upon the manner in which the two countries will conduct and coordinate the next phase of the engineering studies of those systems&amp;nbsp;... The understandings&amp;nbsp;... were reached more often than not outside of formal meetings, and so are not likely otherwise to be reported."&lt;ref name="IntDodckSys" /&gt; For example, in the area of hatch diameter, he noted that "it became apparent from the beginning&amp;nbsp;... that a hatch diameter greater than about 800 mm could not be incorporated into the Salyut spacecraft without great difficulty," but MSC had "long since reconciled itself" to a test hatch diameter of less than 1 meter.&lt;ref name="IntDodckSys" /&gt; Johnson went on to comment that "the capture ring assembly had variously been called ring and cone, double ring and cone, and ring and fingers.&lt;ref name="IntDodckSys" /&gt; It was agreed henceforth to call the capture ring 'ring' and the fingers 'guides.'"&lt;ref name="IntDodckSys" /&gt;

Bill Creasy and several of his colleagues worked with Yevgeniy Gennadiyevich Bobrov at the drafting table to lay out these first Soviet-American engineering drawings.&lt;ref name="Interface"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4209/ch6-8.htm|title= SP-4209 The Partnership: A History of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project: Designing the Interface|author1=Edward Clinton Ezell |author2=Linda Neuman Ezell |date=1978|publisher=NASA|access-date=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larry Ratcliff drew the capture ring and guides on drafting paper, and Robert McElya supplied the details of the structural interface ring, while Bobrov prepared a similar drawing for the structural latches.&lt;ref name="Interface" /&gt; T.O. Ross then took these drawings and conducted a dimensional analysis to be sure that all items were compatible.&lt;ref name="Interface" /&gt; Agreement on technical specifications for the docking system cleared the way for NASA to begin discussions with Rockwell about building the docking system.&lt;ref name="Interface" /&gt;

In April 1972, the Soviets informed NASA that they had chosen to use a Soyuz spacecraft in place of a Saylut space station for cost and technical reasons.&lt;ref name="ApInMos"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4209/ch6-9.htm|title= SP-4209 The Partnership: A History of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project: April in Moscow|author1=Edward Clinton Ezell |author2=Linda Neuman Ezell |date=1978|publisher=NASA|access-date=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Final official approval of a joint docking mission came in Moscow on 24 May 1972. U.S. President Nixon and U.S.S.R. Premier Aleksey N. Kosygin signed the Agreement Concerning Cooperation in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space for Peaceful Purposes, including development of compatible spacecraft docking systems to improve safety of manned space flight and to make joint scientific experiments possible.&lt;ref name="NASAName" /&gt; The first flight to test the systems was to be in 1975, with modified Apollo and Soyuz spacecraft.&lt;ref name="NASAName" /&gt; Beyond this mission, future manned spacecraft of the two nations were hoped to be able to dock with each other.&lt;ref name="NASAName" /&gt;

[[File:Subscale mock-up of APAS-75.jpg|thumbnail|right|Scale prototypes were constructed to help assist in development]]
In July 1972, the group concentrated on spelling out more fully specifications for the docking system.&lt;ref name="JulyHoust"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4209/ch7-2.htm|title= SP-4209 The Partnership: A History of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project: July in Houston|author1=Edward Clinton Ezell |author2=Linda Neuman Ezell |date=1978|publisher=NASA|accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some refinements were made in the guides and other parts of the mechanism; as with the other groups, a schedule for the upcoming months was written, indicating documents to be prepared and tests to be conducted.&lt;ref name="JulyHoust" /&gt; After the team had a thorough look at the American two-fifths-scale docking system, which helped the designers discuss the operation of the mechanism and decide on refinements, they scheduled joint model tests for December.&lt;ref name="JulyHoust" /&gt; Then the engineers would be able to see just how the interfacing elements of one country's system mated with those of the other.&lt;ref name="JulyHoust" /&gt; The Soviets said they would draft the "Test Plan for Scale Models of Apollo/Soyuz Docking System" (IED 50003), while the Americans drew up the dimensions of the model and the test fixtures.&lt;ref name="JulyHoust" /&gt;

Under the direction of Syromyatnikov, the Soviet team had readied their documentation in both English and Russian and had prepared their two-fifths-scale model of the docking system for the joint meeting.&lt;ref name="PSR1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4209/ch7-4.htm|title= SP-4209 The Partnership: A History of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project: Preliminary Systems Review (Stage I)|author1=Edward Clinton Ezell |author2=Linda Neuman Ezell |date=1978|publisher=NASA|access-date=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the Americans observed that while the U.S.S.R. mechanism was more complex mechanically than the American one, it was suitable for the mission and "sophisticated" in its execution.&lt;ref name="PSR1" /&gt; The two sides reviewed and signed the two-fifths-model test plan and scheduled the test for December in Moscow.&lt;ref name="PSR1" /&gt;

The Preliminary Systems Review (PSR) was planned to be a "formal configuration review&amp;nbsp;... initiated near the end of the conceptual phase, but prior to the start of detail design" work on the docking mechanism.&lt;ref name="PSR1" /&gt; As part of their presentation to the Preliminary Systems Review Board (the Board being the Technical Directors), Don Wade and Syromyatnikov included all the test data, specifications, and drawings for the docking system, as well as a design evaluation for the mechanism. After hearing their report, Lunney and Bushuyev felt three problem areas needed further study.&lt;ref name="PSR1" /&gt; First, the requirement for a spring thruster designed to help separate the two spacecraft had caught their attention, since the failure of this thruster to compress properly could prevent completion of docking.&lt;ref name="PSR1" /&gt; Second, Lunney and Bushuyev emphasized the importance of an indicator that would verify that the structural latches were properly in place.&lt;ref name="PSR1" /&gt; The American system provided information on the functioning of each latch but did not indicate that the interface seals were compressed, while the Soviet system gave data on compression of the seals but none for the latches.&lt;ref name="PSR1" /&gt; To assure the structural integrity of the transfer tunnel, it was important to know that all eight latches were closed.&lt;ref name="PSR1" /&gt; The third problem area was whether it was possible for the structural latches be inadvertently released.&lt;ref name="PSR1" /&gt; Bushuyev and Lunney called for a thorough re-evaluation of all these issues and advised the group to present their specific recommendations to them in December and January.&lt;ref name="PSR1" /&gt;

The group tests of the two-fifths-scale model and the second part of the Preliminary Systems Review for the docking system was the last joint activity scheduled for 1972.&lt;ref name="PSR2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4209/ch7-7.htm|title= SP-4209 The Partnership: A History of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project: Preliminary Systems Review (Stage 2)|author1=Edward Clinton Ezell |author2=Linda Neuman Ezell |date=1978|publisher=NASA|access-date=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Americans arrived in Moscow on December 6 and worked through December 15.&lt;ref name="PSR2" /&gt; Testing the scale models occurred at the Institute of Space Research in Moscow.&lt;ref name="PSR2" /&gt;

Tests of the full-scale Soviet and American docking systems began in Houston during October 1973.&lt;ref name="YearInte"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4209/ch7-8.htm|title= SP-4209 The Partnership: A History of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project: Years of Intense Activity |author1=Edward Clinton Ezell |author2=Linda Neuman Ezell |date=1978|publisher=NASA|access-date=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===APAS-89===
{{double image|right|APAS-89 forward docking mechanism on Kristall.jpg|120|APAS-89 active - drawing.png|134|Passive|Active|}}
When the USSR started working on [[Mir]] they were also working on the [[Buran program|Buran]] shuttle program. APAS-89 was envisioned to be the docking system for Buran with the Mir space station. The APAS-75 design was heavily modified. The outer diameter was reduced from 2030&amp;nbsp;mm to 1550&amp;nbsp;mm and the alignment petals were pointed inward instead of outward. This limited the internal passage diameter of the docking port to about 800&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20110010964_2011009594.pdf|title=ISS Interface Mechanisms and their Heritage|author=John Cook |author2=Valery Aksamentov |author3=Thomas Hoffman |author4=Wes Bruner |year=2011|publisher=Boeing|accessdate=26 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Buran shuttle was finally canceled in 1994 and never flew to the Mir space station, but Mir's [[Kristall]] module was outfitted with two APAS-89 docking mechanisms. The [[Mir Docking Module]], basically a spacer module between Kristall and the Shuttle, also used APAS-89 on both sides.

===APAS-95===
{{double image|right|APAS-95 passive side.jpg|120|APAS-95 active side.jpg|134|Passive (non-androgynous variant)|Active|}}
APAS was selected for the [[Shuttle-Mir]] program and manufactured by Russian company [[RKK Energiya]] under a $18 million contract signed in June 1993.&lt;ref name=twentyfirst&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=Ben|title=The Twenty-first Century in Space|publisher=Springer|date=2014|pages=186|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BH7ZBQAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rockwell International, prime contractor for the Shuttle, accepted delivery of hardware from Energiya in September 1994&lt;ref name=twentyfirst/&gt; and integrated it onto Space Shuttles' Orbiter Docking System, an add-on that was installed in the payload bay and was originally meant for use with [[Space Station Freedom]].

Although Energia's code for the Shuttle APAS is APAS-95, it has been described as being basically the same as APAS-89.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bart Hendrickx |author2=Bert Vis|title=Energiya-Buran: The Soviet Space Shuttle|publisher=Praxis Publishing Ltd|location=Chichester, UK|year=2007|pages=379–381|isbn=978-0-387-69848-9|quote=Although Energiya's internal designator for the Shuttle APAS is APAS-95, it is essentially the same as Buran's APAS-89|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VRb1yAGVWNsC&amp;dq=%22APAS-95%22+nasa&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had a mass of 286&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref name=twentyfirst/&gt;

APAS-95 was selected to join the American and Russian modules on the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) and to allow the Space Shuttle, Soyuz, Progress and Automated Transfer Vehicle spacecraft to dock. The Shuttle's Orbiter Docking System remained unchanged from when it was used for the [[Shuttle–Mir Program]] in 1995. The active [[capture ring]] that extends outward from the spacecraft captured the passive mating ring on the space station's APAS-95 connection on the [[Pressurized Mating Adapter]]. The capture ring aligned them, pulled them together and deployed 12 structural hooks, latching the two systems with an airtight seal. The Pressurized Mating Adapters are permanently passive.

There may be [[coral island]]s or [[cay]]s on the rim.&lt;ref name="blakegh1" /&gt;{{rp|page=60}}&lt;ref name="Migon2010"&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Piotr |editor-last=Migoń|editor-link=Piotr Migoń|title=Geomorphological Landscapes of the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-TI55urJYyEC|accessdate=12 February 2013 |year=2010 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-90-481-3055-9 |page=349}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coral of the atoll often sits atop the rim of an extinct [[seamount]] or [[volcano]] which has eroded or subsided partially beneath the water. The lagoon forms over the volcanic crater or [[caldera]] while the higher rim remains above water(s) or at shallow depths that permit the coral to grow and form the reefs. For the atoll to persist, continued erosion or subsidence must be at a rate slow enough to permit reef growth upwards and outwards to replace the lost height.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Erickson |first1=Jon |title=Marine Geology |publisher=Facts on File |year=2003 |isbn=0-8160-4874-6 |pages=126–8 |ref=none }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==
The word ''atoll'' comes from the [[Dhivehi language|Dhivehi]] (an [[Indo-Aryan language]] spoken on the [[Maldives|Maldive Islands]]) word ''atholhu'' ([[Dhivehi language|Dhivehi]]: {{lang|dv|އަތޮޅު}}, {{IPA-dv|ˈət̪ɔɭu|}}), meaning an administrative subdivision.&lt;sup&gt;''[[OED]]''&lt;/sup&gt; Its first recorded use in English was in 1625 as ''atollon''. [[Charles Darwin]] recognized its indigenous origin and coined, in his ''[[The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs]]'', the definition of atolls as "circular groups of coral islets" that is synonymous with "lagoon-island".&lt;ref name="darwincr1" /&gt;{{rp|page=2}}

More modern definitions of ''atoll'' describe them as "annular reefs enclosing a lagoon in which there are no [[Promontory|promontories]] other than reefs and [[islet]]s composed of reef [[detritus (biology)|detritus]]"&lt;ref&gt;McNeil (1954, p.&amp;nbsp;396).&lt;/ref&gt; or "in an exclusively morphological sense, [as] a ring-shaped ribbon reef enclosing a lagoon".&lt;ref&gt;Fairbridge (1950, p.&amp;nbsp;341).&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the world's atolls are in the Pacific Ocean (with concentrations in the [[Tuamotu Islands]], [[Caroline Islands]], [[Marshall Islands]], [[Coral Sea Islands]], and the island groups of [[Kiribati]], [[Tuvalu]] and [[Tokelau]]) and [[Indian Ocean]] (the [[Atolls of the Maldives]], the [[Lakshadweep Islands]], the [[Chagos Archipelago]] and the [[Outer Islands (Seychelles)|Outer Islands]] of the [[Seychelles]]). The Atlantic Ocean has no large groups of atolls, other than eight atolls east of [[Nicaragua]] that belong to the [[Colombia]]n department of [[San Andres and Providencia]] in the Caribbean.

Reef-building corals will thrive only in warm [[Tropics|tropical]] and [[Subtropics|subtropical]] waters of oceans and seas, and therefore atolls are only found in the tropics and subtropics. The northernmost atoll of the world is [[Kure Atoll]] at 28°24′ N, along with other atolls of the [[Northwestern Hawaiian Islands]]. The southernmost atolls of the world are [[Elizabeth Reef]] at 29°58′ S, and nearby [[Middleton Reef]] at 29°29′ S, in the [[Tasman Sea]], both of which are part of the [[Coral Sea Islands]] Territory. The next southerly atoll is [[Ducie Island]] in the [[Pitcairn Islands]] Group, at 24°40′ S. [[Bermuda]] is sometimes claimed as the "northernmost atoll" at a [[latitude]] of 32°24′ N. At this latitude coral reefs would not develop without the warming waters of the [[Gulf Stream]]. However, Bermuda is termed a ''[[pseudo-atoll]]'' because its general form, while resembling that of an atoll, has a very different mode of formation. While there is no atoll directly on the equator, the closest atoll to the Equator is [[Aranuka]] of Kiribati, with its southern tip just 12&amp;nbsp;km north of the equator.

In most cases, the land area of an atoll is very small in comparison to the total area. Atoll islands are low lying, with their elevations less than 5 meters (9). Measured by total area, [[Lifou]] (1146&amp;nbsp;km²) is the largest [[raised coral atoll]] of the world, followed by [[Rennell Island]] (660&amp;nbsp;km²).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldislandinfo.com/MISINFORMATION.htm |title=Misinformation about Islands |publisher=worldislandinfo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More sources however list as the largest atoll in the world in terms of land area [[Kiritimati]], which is also a raised coral atoll (321.37&amp;nbsp;km² land area; according to other sources even 575&amp;nbsp;km²), 160&amp;nbsp;km² main lagoon, 168&amp;nbsp;km² other lagoons (according to other sources 319&amp;nbsp;km² total lagoon size). The remains of an ancient atoll as a hill in a limestone area is called a [[reef knoll]]. The second largest atoll by dry land area is [[Aldabra]] with 155&amp;nbsp;km². The largest atoll in terms of island numbers is [[Huvadhu]] Atoll in the south of the Maldives with 255 islands.

In 1842, Charles Darwin explained the creation of coral atolls in the southern Pacific Ocean based upon observations made during a five-year voyage aboard {{HMS|Beagle}} from 1831 to 1836. Accepted as basically correct, his explanation involved considering that several tropical island types—from high [[volcanic island]], through [[barrier reef]] island, to atoll—represented a sequence of gradual [[subsidence]] of what started as an oceanic [[volcano]]. He reasoned that a [[fringing reef|fringing coral reef]] surrounding a volcanic island in the tropical sea will grow upwards as the island subsides (sinks), becoming an "almost atoll", or barrier reef island, as typified by an island such as [[Aitutaki]] in the Cook Islands, [[Bora Bora]] and others in the [[Society Islands]]. The fringing reef becomes a barrier reef for the reason that the outer part of the reef maintains itself near [[sea level]] through [[biotic potential|biotic]] growth, while the inner part of the reef falls behind, becoming a lagoon because conditions are less favorable for the coral and calcareous [[algae]] responsible for most reef growth. In time, subsidence carries the old volcano below the ocean surface and the barrier reef remains.  At this point, the island has become an atoll.

Atolls are the product of the growth of tropical marine organisms, and so these islands are only found in warm tropical waters. Volcanic islands located beyond the warm water temperature requirements of [[hermatypic]] (reef-building) organisms become [[seamount]]s as they subside and are eroded away at the surface. An island that is located where the ocean water temperatures are just sufficiently warm for upward reef growth to keep pace with the rate of subsidence is said to be at the '''Darwin Point'''.  Islands in colder, more polar regions evolve towards seamounts or [[guyot]]s; warmer, more equatorial islands evolve towards atolls, for example [[Kure Atoll]].

&lt;gallery widths="120" heights="80"&gt;
Atoll forming-volcano.png|Darwin's theory starts with a [[volcanic island]] which becomes extinct
Atoll forming-Fringing reef.png|As the island and ocean floor subside, coral growth builds a [[fringing reef]], often including a shallow lagoon between the land and the main reef
Atoll forming-Barrier reef.png|As the subsidence continues the fringing reef becomes a larger barrier reef farther from the shore with a bigger and deeper [[lagoon]] inside
Atoll forming-Atoll.png|Ultimately the island sinks below the sea, and the barrier reef becomes an atoll enclosing an open lagoon
&lt;/gallery&gt;

[[Reginald Aldworth Daly]] offered a somewhat different explanation for atoll formation: islands worn away by [[erosion]], by ocean waves and streams, during the last [[Quaternary glaciation|glacial stand]] of the sea of some {{convert|900|ft|m}} below present sea level developed as coral islands (atolls), or barrier reefs on a platform surrounding a volcanic island not completely worn away, as sea level gradually rose from melting of the [[glacier]]s. Discovery of the great depth of the volcanic remnant beneath many atolls such as at [[Midway Atoll]] favors the Darwin explanation, although there can be little doubt that fluctuating sea level has had considerable influence on atolls and other reefs.

Coral atolls are also an important place where [[dolomitization]] of [[calcite]] occurs. At certain depths water is undersaturated in [[calcium carbonate]]  but saturated in [[dolomite]]. Convection created by tides and sea currents enhance this change. Hydrothermal currents created by volcanoes under the atoll may also play an important role.

== Investigation by the Royal Society of London into the formation of coral reefs ==
In 1896, 1897 and 1898, the [[Royal Society of London]] carried out drilling on [[Funafuti]] atoll in [[Tuvalu]] for the purpose of investigating the [[formation of coral reefs]] to determine whether traces of shallow water organisms could be found at depth in the [[coral]] of Pacific atolls. This investigation followed the work on [[The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs|the structure and distribution of coral reefs]] conducted by [[Charles Darwin]] in the Pacific.

The first expedition in 1896 was led by Professor [[William Johnson Sollas]] of the [[University of Oxford]]. The geologists included [[Walter George Woolnough]] and [[Edgeworth David]] of the [[University of Sydney]]. Professor Edgeworth David led the expedition in 1897.&lt;ref name="davidcm1" /&gt; The third expedition in 1898 was led by [[Alfred Edmund Finckh]].&lt;ref name="finckhae1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cantrellc1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rodgerska1" /&gt;

The '''bathyal zone''' or '''bathypelagic''' – from Greek [[wikt:βαθύς|βαθύς]] (bathýs), ''deep'' – (also known as '''midnight zone''') is the part of the [[pelagic zone]] that extends from a depth of {{convert|1000|to|4000|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}} below the [[Sea level|ocean surface]].&lt;ref name=NWS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/jetstream/ocean/layers_ocean.html |title=Bathypelagic zone |work=Layers of the ocean |publisher=National Weather Service |accessdate=28 June 2017 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170207094728/http://www.srh.noaa.gov/jetstream/ocean/layers_ocean.html |archivedate=7 February 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7655358.stm|first= Rebecca|last= Morelle |title= Deepest ever' living fish filmed |work=BBC News|date=7 October 2008|access-date=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It lies between the [[mesopelagic]] above, and the [[abyssopelagic]] below. The average temperature hovers at about {{convert|4|C|F}}. Although larger by volume than the [[euphotic zone]], the bathyal zone is less densely populated. Sunlight does not reach this zone, meaning [[primary production]], if any, is almost nonexistent. There are no known plants because of the lack of sunlight necessary for photosynthesis. It is known as the midnight (also twilight or dark) zone because of this feature.&lt;ref name=NWS/&gt;

==Fauna==
{{see|Bathypelagic fish}}

Because of lack of light some species do not have eyes. Those possessing eyes in this zone include the [[viperfish]] and the [[frill shark]]. Many forms of [[nekton]] live in the bathyal zone, such as [[squid]], large [[whale]]s, and [[octopuses]]. In the bathyal, some of the world's largest whales feed. Sponges, brachiopods, sea stars, and echinoids are also common in the bathyal zone. Animals in the bathyal zone are not threatened by [[predation|predator]]s that can see them, so they do not have powerful muscles. This zone is difficult for fish to live in since it is especially hard to find nutrients. They have become very energy efficient, and many have slow metabolic rates to conserve energy. The fish are characterised by weak muscles, soft skin and slimy bodies. The adaptations of some of the fish that live there include small eyes and transparent skin.

Except where the ocean is exceptionally deep, the bathyal zone extends to the [[benthic zone]] on the ocean bed of that part of the [[continental slope]] that lies between 1000 and 4000 meters deep.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}
The bathyal zone contains sharks, squid, octopuses, and many different species of fish. This includes deep-water [[anglerfish]], [[gulper eel]], [[amphipod]]s and [[Stomiidae|dragonfish]].

'''Bollard pull''' is a conventional measure of the pulling (or towing) power of a [[watercraft]]. It is defined as the [[force]] (in [[Ton#Units of force|tons]] or kilonewtons (kN)) exerted by a [[Marine vessel|vessel]] under full power, on a shore-mounted [[bollard]] through a tow-line, commonly measured in a practical test (but sometimes simulated) under test conditions that include calm water, no [[tide]], level trim, and sufficient depth and side clearance for a free [[propeller]] stream. Like the [[horsepower]] or [[Fuel economy in automobiles|mileage]] rating of a car, it is a convenient but idealized number that must be adjusted for operating conditions that differ from the test.  The bollard pull of a vessel may be reported as two numbers, the ''static'' or ''maximum'' bollard pull - the highest force measured - and the ''steady'' or ''continuous'' bollard pull, the average of measurements over an interval of, for example, 10 minutes. An equivalent measurement on land is known as [[Drawbar (haulage)|drawbar]] [[Drawbar pull|pull]], or [[tractive force]], which is used to measure the total horizontal force generated by a [[locomotive]], a piece of [[heavy machinery]] such as a [[tractor]], or a [[truck]], (specifically a [[ballast tractor]]), which is utilized to move a load.

Bollard pull is primarily (but not only) used for measuring the strength of [[tugboat]]s, with the largest commercial harbour tugboats in the 2000-2010s having around {{convert|60|to(-)|65|STf|kN}} of bollard pull, which is described as {{convert|15|STf|kN}} above "normal" tugboats.&lt;ref name=ZOE&gt;{{cite news|title=Rotor Tug "RT Zoe"|url=http://www.marinelink.com/news/article/rotor-tug-rt-zoe/311274.aspx|accessdate=19 August 2013|newspaper=Marineline.com|date=13 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chittagong&gt;{{cite news|title=Western Marine to build tugboat, vessel for Ctg port|url=http://www.hawker.com.bd/news_details_print.php?news_id=213869|accessdate=19 August 2013|newspaper=The Independent|date=4 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Resistive force is roughly 1/2 water density times velocity square times area of ship wet surface.
R = 1/2d v^2 A

==Background==
Unlike in ground vehicles, the statement of installed [[horsepower]] is not sufficient to understand how strong a tug is - this is because other factors, like transmission losses, propulsion type, and propulsion system efficiency have an influence as well.

Bollard pull values are stated in [[Ton#Units of force|tons]] (written as TBP) or kiloNewtons (kN).&lt;ref&gt;Note the inherent conflict: the [[SI]] unit of force is the [[Newton (unit)|Newton]]. Even accepting ton as a unit of force, the value of a ton or tonne can mean anything between 8.89 kN and 10.00 kN, depending on the definition used.&lt;/ref&gt;
Estimated horsepower is equal to total resistance times velocity divided by 550. in the english system units, HP = R*v/ 550

==Measurement==
Values for bollard pull can be determined in two ways.

===Practical trial===

[[Image:Bollard pull idealized-2.svg|thumb|Figure 1: bollard pull trial under ideal (imaginary) conditions]]

This method is useful for one-off ship designs and smaller [[shipyard]]s. It is limited in precision - a number of boundary conditions need to be observed to obtain reliable results.  Summarizing the below requirements, practical bollard pull trials need to be conducted in a [[List of Panamax ports|deep water seaport]], ideally not at the mouth of a river, on a calm day with hardly any traffic.
* The ship needs to be in undisturbed water. [[Ocean current|Currents]] or strong [[wind]]s would falsify the measurement.
* The static [[force]] that intends to move the ship forward must only be generated by the [[friction]] between the [[propeller]] discharge race and the surrounding water. If the ship were too close to a wall, the measurement would be falsified.
* The ship must be in deep water. If there were any ground effect, the measurement would be falsified. The same holds true for [[propeller walk]].
* Water [[salinity]] must have a well-defined value, as it influences the specific weight of the water and thereby the [[mass]] moved by the propeller per unit of time.
* The geometry of the towing line must have a well-defined value. Ideally, one would expect it to be exactly horizontal and straight. This is impossible in reality, because
** the line falls into a [[catenary]] due to its weight;
** the two fixed points of the line, being the bollard on shore and the ship's towing hook or cleat, may not have the same height above water.
* Conditions must be static. The engine power, the [[Course (navigation)|heading]] of the ship, the conditions of the propeller discharge race and the tension in the towing line must have settled to a constant or near-constant value for a reliable measurement.
* One condition to watch out for is the formation of a [[short circuit]] in propeller discharge race. If part of the discharge race is sucked back into the propeller, efficiency decreases sharply. This could occur due to a trial that is performed in too shallow water or too close to a wall.

See Figure 2 for an illustration of error influences in a practical bollard pull trial. Note the difference in elevation of the ends of the line (the port bollard is higher than the ship's towing hook). Furthermore, there is the partial short circuit in propeller discharge current, the uneven trim of the ship and the short length of the tow line. All of these factors contribute to measurement error.

[[Image:Bollard pull real.svg|thumb|Figure 2: bollard pull trial under real conditions]]

===Simulation===
This method eliminates much of the uncertainties of the practical trial. However, any numerical simulation also has an error margin. Furthermore, simulation tools and computer systems capable of determining bollard pull for a ship design are costly. Hence, this method makes sense for larger shipyards and for the design of a series of ships.

Both methods can be combined. Practical trials can be used to validate the result of numerical simulation.

==Human-powered vehicles==
Practical bollard pull tests under simplified conditions are conducted for [[human powered vehicles]]. There, bollard pull is often a category in competitions and gives an indication of the power train efficiency. Although conditions for such measurements are inaccurate in absolute terms, they are the same for all competitors. Hence, they can still be valid for comparing several craft.

The '''Buran programme''' ({{lang-ru|Бура́н}}, {{IPA-ru|bʊˈran|IPA}}, "Snowstorm" or "Blizzard"), also known as the "'''VKK Space Orbiter programme'''" ("VKK" is for {{lang-ru|Воздушно Космический Корабль}}, "Air Space Ship"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencefirsthand.ru/gunko.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060320022443/http://www.sciencefirsthand.ru/gunko.pdf |archivedate=20 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and later Russian reusable [[spacecraft]] project that began in 1974 at the [[Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute]] in [[Moscow]] and was formally suspended in 1993.&lt;ref name=harvey/&gt; In addition to being the designation for the whole Soviet/Russian reusable spacecraft project, ''Buran'' was also the name given to [[Buran (spacecraft)|Orbiter K1]], which completed one unmanned spaceflight in 1988 and was the only Soviet reusable spacecraft to be launched into space. The ''Buran''-class orbiters used the expendable [[Energia]] rocket as a [[launch vehicle]]. They are generally treated as a Soviet equivalent of the United States' [[Space Shuttle]], but in the Buran project, only the airplane-shaped orbiter itself was theoretically reusable. While [[1.01 (Buran-class spacecraft)|Orbiter K1]] was recovered successfully after its first orbital flight in 1988, it was never reused.

The Buran programme was started by the [[Soviet Union]] as a response to the United States [[Space Shuttle program]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmbZ4-kgaak |title=Russian shuttle dream dashed by Soviet crash |work=YouTube.com |publisher=[[RT (TV network)|Russia Today]] |date=15 November 2007 |accessdate=16 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was the largest and the most expensive in the history of Soviet [[space exploration]].&lt;ref name=harvey&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kmTz6Phf5WYC&amp;pg=PA8 |title=The Rebirth of the Russian Space Program: 50 Years After Sputnik, New Frontiers |publisher=Springer |first=Brian |last=Harvey |year=2007 |page=8 |isbn=0387713565}}&lt;/ref&gt; Development work included sending [[BOR-5]] test vehicles on multiple sub-orbital test flights, and atmospheric flights of the [[OK-GLI]] aerodynamic prototype.

The OK-GLI resides in [[Technikmuseum Speyer]]. Although the ''Buran'' class was similar in appearance to [[NASA]]'s [[Space Shuttle orbiter]], and could similarly operate as a re-entry [[spaceplane]], its internal and functional design was distinct.  For example, the main engines during launch were on the Energia rocket and were not taken into orbit by the spacecraft. Smaller rocket engines on the craft's body provided propulsion in orbit and de-orbital burns.

== Introduction ==
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2015}}
The Buran orbital vehicle programme was developed in response to the U.S. Space Shuttle programme, which in the 1980s raised considerable concerns among the Soviet military and especially Defense Minister [[Dmitriy Ustinov]].  An authoritative chronicler of the Soviet and later Russian space programmes, the academic [[Boris Chertok]], recounts how the programme came into being.&lt;ref&gt;[https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4110/vol3.pdf Chertok, Boris (2005); Rockets and People]&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=September 2013}}
According to Chertok, after the U.S. developed its Space Shuttle programme, the Soviet military became suspicious that it could be used for military purposes, due to its enormous payload, several times that of previous U.S. launch vehicles. The Soviet government asked the [[TsNIIMash]] (ЦНИИМАШ, Central Institute of Machine-building, a major player in defense analysis) for an expert opinion. Institute director, Yuri Mozzhorin, recalls that for a long time the institute could not envisage a civilian payload large enough to require a vehicle of that capacity.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Officially, the Buran orbital vehicle was designed for the delivery to orbit and return to Earth of spacecraft, cosmonauts, and supplies. Both Chertok and [[Gleb Lozino-Lozinskiy]] (Chief Designer of [[S.P. Korolev Rocket and Space Corporation Energia|RKK Energia]]) suggest that from the beginning, the programme was military in nature; however, the exact military capabilities, or intended capabilities, of the ''Buran'' programme remain classified. Commenting on the discontinuation of the programme in his interview to ''[[New Scientist]]'', Russian [[cosmonaut]] [[Oleg Kotov]] confirms their accounts:

{{Quotation|We had no civilian tasks for ''Buran'' and the military ones were no longer needed. It was originally designed as a military system for weapon delivery, maybe even nuclear weapons. The American shuttle also has military uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20664-cosmonaut-soviet-space-shuttle-was-safer-than-nasas.html |title=Cosmonaut: Soviet space shuttle was safer than NASA's |date=7 July 2011 |author=Paul Marks}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Like its American counterpart, the ''Buran'' orbital vehicle, when in transit from its landing sites back to the launch complex, was transported on the back of a large jet aeroplane — the [[Antonov An-225 Mriya]] transport aircraft, which was designed in part for this task and remains the largest aircraft in the world to fly multiple times.&lt;ref name="avzone"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theaviationzone.com/factsheets/an225.asp |title=Antonov An-225 Mryia (Cossack) |work=The Aviation Zone}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=September 2013}}  Before the ''Mriya'' was ready (after the ''Buran'' had flown), the [[Myasishchev VM-T]] ''Atlant'', a variant on the Soviet [[Myasishchev M-4]] ''Molot'' (Hammer) bomber (NATO code: Bison), fulfilled the same role.

== History of the Buran programme ==

=== Background ===
The Soviet reusable space-craft programme has its roots in the very beginning of the space age, the late 1950s. The idea of Soviet reusable space flight is very old, though it was neither continuous, nor consistently organized. Before Buran, no project of the programme reached production.

The idea saw its first iteration in the [[Burya]] high-altitude jet aircraft, which reached the prototype stage. Several test flights are known, before it was cancelled by order of the [[Central Committee]]. The [[Burya]] had the goal of delivering a nuclear payload, presumably to the United States, and then returning to base. The cancellation was based on a final decision to develop [[ICBM]]s. The next iteration of the idea was [[Zvezda (spacecraft)|Zvezda]] from the early 1960s, which also reached a prototype stage. Decades later, [[Zvezda (ISS module)|another project with the same name]] was used as a service module for the [[International Space Station]]. After Zvezda, there was a hiatus in reusable projects until Buran.

=== Programme development ===
The development of the Buran began in the early 1970s as a response to the U.S. Space Shuttle program. Soviet officials were concerned about a perceived military threat posed by the U.S. Space Shuttle. In their opinion, the Shuttle's 30-ton payload-to-orbit capacity and, more significantly, its 15-ton payload return capacity, were a clear indication that one of its main objectives would be to place massive experimental laser weapons into orbit that could destroy enemy missiles from a distance of several thousands of kilometers. Their reasoning was that such weapons could only be effectively tested in actual space conditions and that to cut their development time and save costs it would be necessary to regularly bring them back to Earth for modifications and fine-tuning.{{sfn|Hendrickx|Vis|2007}} Soviet officials were also concerned that the U.S. Space Shuttle could make a sudden dive into the atmosphere to drop bombs on Moscow.&lt;ref name="BBC Buran"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7738489.stm |title=Buran – the Soviet 'space shuttle' |work=BBC News |first=Anatoly |last=Zak |date=20 November 2008 |accessdate=7 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soviet [[engineers]] were initially reluctant to design a spacecraft that looked superficially identical to the Shuttle, but subsequent [[wind tunnel]] testing showed that NASA's design was already ideal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Spaceflight: The Complete Story From Sputnik to Shuttle—and Beyond |publisher=DK Publishers |first=Giles |last=Sparrow |year=2009 |page=215 |isbn=9780756656416}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Even though the Molniya Scientific Production Association proposed its [[Mikoyan-Gurevich_MiG-105|Spiral]] programme design (halted 13 years earlier), it was rejected as being altogether dissimilar from the American shuttle design.  While [[NPO Molniya]] conducted development under the lead of [[Gleb Lozino-Lozinskiy]], the Soviet Union's Military-Industrial Commission, or VPK, was tasked with collecting all data it could on the U.S. Space Shuttle. Under the auspices of the KGB, the VPK was able to amass documentation on the American shuttle's airframe designs, design analysis software, materials, flight computer systems and propulsion systems.  The KGB targeted many university research project documents and databases, including Caltech, MIT, Princeton, Stanford and others. The thoroughness of the acquisition of data was made much easier as the U.S. shuttle development was unclassified.&lt;ref name="NBC News"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/18686090/ns/technology_and_science-space/t/how-soviets-stole-space-shuttle/ |title=How the Soviets stole a space shuttle |work=NBC News |last=Windrem |first=Robert |date=4 November 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The construction of the shuttles began in 1980, and by 1984 the first full-scale Buran was rolled out. The first [[sub-orbital flight|suborbital]] test flight of a scale-model ([[BOR-5]]) took place as early as July 1983. As the project progressed, five additional scale-model flights were performed.  A test vehicle was constructed with four jet engines mounted at the rear; this vehicle is usually referred to as [[OK-GLI]], or as the "Buran aerodynamic analogue". The jets were used to take off from a normal landing strip, and once it reached a designated point, the engines were cut and OK-GLI glided back to land. This provided invaluable information about the handling characteristics of the Buran design, and significantly differed from the carrier plane/air drop method used by the United States and the {{OV|101|full=no}} test craft. Twenty-four test flights of OK-GLI were performed by the [[Gromov Flight Research Institute]] [[test pilot]]s and researchers after which the shuttle was "worn out". The developers considered using a couple of [[Mil Mi-26]] [[helicopter]]s to "bundle" lift the Buran, but test flights with a [[mock-up]] showed how risky and impractical that was.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buran-energia.com/documentation/documentation-akc-air-transportation.php |title=BURAN Orbital Spaceship Airframe Creation |work=Buran-Energia.com |first=V.

The flight and ground-testing software also required research. In 1983 the Buran developers estimated that the software development would require several thousand programmers if done with their existing methodology (in assembly language), and they appealed to [[Keldysh Institute of Applied Mathematics]] for assistance. It was decided to develop a new high-level "problem-oriented" programming language. Researchers at Keldysh developed two languages:  PROL2 (used for real-time programming of onboard systems) and DIPOL (used for the ground-based test systems), as well as the development and debugging environment SAPO PROLOGUE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.keldysh.ru/pages/anniver/achievment/22_prog.htm |title=Системное и прикладное программирование |trans-title=System and application programming |series=50th Anniversary of Institute for Applied Mathematics |publisher=Keldysh Institute of Applied Mathematics |date=2004 |accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also an operating system known as Prolog Manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.keldysh.ru/departments/dpt_23/dpt_23.html |title=Отдел программных комплексов |trans-title=Department of software systems |publisher=Keldysh Institute of Applied Mathematics |accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work on these languages continued beyond the end of the Buran project, with PROL2 being extended into SIPROL,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://doc.sumy.ua/prog/prg96/85.htm |title=Интегрированный подход к разработке крупных программных систем управления реального времени |trans-title=An integrated approach to the development of large software systems, real-time control |conference=Индустрия программирования [Software industry] |location=Moscow |first1=V. |last1=Kryukov |first2=A. |last2=Petrenko |date=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually all three languages developed into [[DRAKON]] which is still in use in the Russian space industry. A declassified May 1990 CIA report citing [[open-source intelligence]] material states that the software for the Buran spacecraft was written in "the French-developed programming language known as [[Prolog]]",&lt;ref name="SovSoftProd"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/DOC_0000498691.pdf |title=Soviet Software Productivity: Isolated Gains in an Uphill Battle |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency |page=7 |date=May 1990 |id=SW 90-10029X |accessdate=9 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; possibly due to confusion with the name PROLOGUE.

=== Flight crew preparation ===
{{main|List of human spaceflight programs}}
Until the end of the Soviet Union in 1991, seven [[cosmonaut]]s were allocated to the Buran programme and trained on the [[OK-GLI|OK-GLI ("Buran aerodynamic analogue")]] test vehicle. All had experience as test pilots. They were: [[Ivan Ivanovich Bachurin]], [[Alexei Sergeyevich Borodai]], [[Anatoli Levchenko|Anatoli Semyonovich Levchenko]], [[Aleksandr Vladimirovich Shchukin]], [[Rimantas Stankevičius|Rimantas Antanas Stankevičius]], [[Igor Volk|Igor Petrovich Volk]] and [[Viktor Vasiliyevich Zabolotsky]].

A rule, set in place for cosmonauts because of the failed [[Soyuz 25]] of 1977, insisted that all Soviet space missions contain at least one crew member who has been to space before. In 1982, it was decided that all Buran commanders and their back-ups would occupy the third seat on a Soyuz mission, prior to their Buran spaceflight.{{sfn|Hendrickx|Vis|2007}} Several people had been selected to potentially be in the first Buran crew. By 1985, it was decided that at least one of the two crew members would be a [[test pilot]] trained at the [[Gromov Flight Research Institute]] (known as "LII"), and potential crew lists were drawn up.{{sfn|Hendrickx|Vis|2007}} Only two potential Buran crew members reached space: [[Igor Volk]], who flew in [[Soyuz T-12]] to the space station [[Salyut 7]], and [[Anatoli Levchenko]] who visited [[Mir]], launching with [[Soyuz TM-4]] and landing with [[Soyuz TM-3]].{{sfn|Hendrickx|Vis|2007}} Both of these spaceflights lasted about a week.

Levchenko died of a brain tumour the year after his orbital flight, Bachurin left the cosmonaut corps because of medical reasons, Shchukin was assigned to the back-up crew of Soyuz TM-4 and later died in a plane crash, Stankevičius was also killed in a plane crash, while Borodai and Zabolotsky remained unassigned to a Soyuz flight until the Buran programme ended.

==== Spaceflight of I. P. Volk ====
{{main|Soyuz T-12}}
[[Igor Volk]] was planned to be the commander of the first manned Buran flight. There were two purposes of the Soyuz T-12 mission, one of which was to give Volk spaceflight experience. The other purpose, seen as the more important factor, was to beat the United States and have the first [[Extra-vehicular activity|spacewalk]] by a woman.{{sfn|Hendrickx|Vis|2007}} At the time of the Soyuz T-12 mission the Buran programme was still a [[Classified information|state secret]]. The appearance of Volk as a crew member caused some, including the [[British Interplanetary Society]] magazine ''[[Spaceflight (magazine)|Spaceflight]]'', to ask why a test pilot was occupying a Soyuz seat usually reserved for researchers or foreign cosmonauts.&lt;ref name=VisBook&gt;{{cite book |last=Hendrickx |first=Bart |authorlink= |author2=Bert Vis |title=Energiya-Buran : The Soviet Space Shuttle |publisher=Praxis |date=4 October 2007 |location= |pages=526 |url= |doi= |id= |isbn=0-387-69848-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Spaceflight of A. S. Levchenko ====
[[Anatoli Levchenko]] was planned to be the back-up commander of the first manned Buran flight, and in March 1987 he began extensive training for his Soyuz spaceflight.{{sfn|Hendrickx|Vis|2007}} In December 1987, he occupied the third seat aboard [[Soyuz TM-4]] to Mir, and returned to Earth about a week later on [[Soyuz TM-3]]. His mission is sometimes called ''Mir LII-1'', after the [[Gromov Flight Research Institute]] shorthand.&lt;ref name=EA-LII&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astronautix.com/flights/mirlii1.htm |title=Mir LII-1 |work=[[Encyclopedia Astronautica]] |first=Mark |last=Wade |accessdate=15 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130020104/http://astronautix.com/flights/mirlii1.htm |archivedate=30 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; When Levchenko died the following year, it left the back-up crew of the first Buran mission again without spaceflight experience. A Soyuz spaceflight for another potential back-up commander was sought by the Gromov Flight Research Institute, but never occurred.{{sfn|Hendrickx|Vis|2007}}

=== Ground facilities ===
Maintenance, launches and landings of the Buran-class orbiters were to take place at the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] in the [[Kazakhstan|Kazakh S.S.R.]] Several facilities at Baikonur were adapted or newly built for these purposes:

* [[Baikonur Cosmodrome Site 110|Site 110]] — Used for the launch of the Buran-class orbiters. Like the assembly and processing hall at Site 112, the launch complex was originally constructed for the [[Soviet manned lunar programs|Soviet lunar landing programme]] and later converted for the Energia-Buran programme.
* Site 112 — Used for orbiter maintenance and to mate the orbiters to their [[Energia]] launchers (thus fulfilling a role similar to the [[Vehicle Assembly Building|VAB]] at [[Kennedy Space Center|KSC]]). The main hangar at the site, called ''MIK RN'' or ''MIK 112'', was originally built for the assembly of the [[N1 (rocket)|N1 moon rocket]]. After cancellation of the N-1 programme in 1974, the facilities at Site 112 were converted for the Energia-Buran programme. It was here that [[1.01 (Buran-class spacecraft)|Orbiter K1]] was stored after the end of the Buran programme and was destroyed when the hangar roof collapsed in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/baikonur_energia_112.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2 August 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706112853/http://www.russianspaceweb.com/baikonur_energia_112.html |archivedate=6 July 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.buran-energia.com/bourane-buran/bourane-fin.php&lt;/ref&gt;
* Site 251 — Used as Buran orbiter landing facility, also known as ''Yubileyniy Airfield'' (and fulfilling a role similar to the [[Shuttle Landing Facility|SLF]] at [[Kennedy Space Center|KSC]]). It features one runway, called 06/24, which is {{convert|4500|m|yd}} long and {{convert|84|m|yd}} wide, paved with "Grade 600" high quality reinforced concrete. At the edge of the runway was a special [[Mate-Demate Device|mating-demating device]], designed to lift an orbiter off its [[Antonov An-225 Mriya]] carrier aircraft and load it on a transporter, which would carry the orbiter to the processing building at Site 254. A purpose-built orbiter landing control facility, housed in a large multi-storey office building, was located near the runway. ''Yubileyniy Airfield'' was also used to receive heavy transport planes carrying elements of the Energia-Buran system. After the end of the Buran programme, Site 251 was abandoned but later reopened as a commercial cargo airport. Besides serving Baikonur, Kazakh authorities also use it for passenger and charter flights from Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/baikonur_energia_251.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2 August 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225010245/http://russianspaceweb.com/baikonur_energia_251.html |archivedate=25 February 2015 |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ourairports.com/airports/UAON/pilot-info.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* Site 254 — Built to service the Buran-class orbiters between flights (thus fulfilling a role similar to the [[Orbiter Processing Facility|OPF]] at [[Kennedy Space Center|KSC]]). Constructed in the 1980s as a special four-bay building, it also featured a large processing area flanked by several floors of test rooms. After cancellation of the Buran programme it was adapted for pre-launch operations of the [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz]] and [[Progress (spacecraft)|Progress]] spacecraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/baikonur_energia_254.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2 August 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150809030907/http://www.russianspaceweb.com/baikonur_energia_254.html |archivedate=9 August 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Missions ===
&lt;!-- references in this section are prefixed with "buran-" for clarity --&gt;
Following a series of atmospheric test flights using the jet-powered [[OK-GLI]] prototype, the first operational spacecraft ([[1.01 (Buran-class spacecraft)|Orbiter K1]]) flew one test mission on 15 November 1988 at 03:00:02 UTC.{{sfn|Hendrickx|Vis|2007|page=349}}  The spacecraft was launched unmanned from and landed at [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] in the [[Kazakhstan|Kazakh S.S.R.]] and flew two orbits, travelling {{convert|83707|km|mi}} in 3 hours and 25 minutes (0.14 flight days).{{sfn|Hendrickx|Vis|2007|page=356}} ''Buran'' never flew again; the programme was cancelled shortly after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="buran-popularscience"&gt;{{cite book |title=The New Book of Popular Science |publisher=Scholastic |volume=1 |page=257 |year=2008 |isbn=9780717212262}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the collapse of the hangar in which it was stored destroyed the Buran orbiter.{{sfn|Hendrickx|Vis|2007|page=388}}&lt;ref name="buran-bbcColapse"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1985631.stm |title=Russia's space dreams abandoned |work=BBC News |first=David |last=Whitehouse |date=13 May 2002 |accessdate=14 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Atmospheric test flights ====
An aerodynamic testbed, [[OK-GLI]], was constructed in 1984 to test the in-flight properties of the Buran design. Unlike the American prototype {{OV|101}}, OK-GLI had four [[Saturn AL-31|AL-31]] [[turbofan]] engines fitted, meaning it was able to fly under its own power.

The only orbital launch of the [[1.01 (Buran-class spacecraft)|Orbiter K1 ''Buran'']] (also known as ""OK-1K1" or "Shuttle 1.01") was at 3:00 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] on 15 November 1988 from [[Baikonur Cosmodrome Site 110|pad 110/37]] in Baikonur. The unmanned craft was lifted into orbit by the specially designed [[Energia]] booster rocket. The life support system was not installed and no software was installed on the [[cathode ray tube|CRT]] displays.&lt;ref name="nasa"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://liftoff.msfc.nasa.gov/rsa/buran.html |title=Shuttle Buran |work=NASA.gov |date=12 November 1997 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060804153528/http://liftoff.msfc.nasa.gov/rsa/buran.html |archivedate=4 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shuttle orbited the [[Earth]] twice in 206 minutes of flight.

==== Planned flights ====
The planned flights for the shuttles in 1989, before the downsizing of the project and eventual cancellation, were:&lt;ref name="projected"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buran.ru/htm/pilots.htm |script-title=ru:Экипажи "Бурана": Несбывшиеся планы |trans-title=The Crews of "Buran": Unfulfilled Plans |work=Buran.ru |first=Vadim |last=Lukashevich |accessdate=5 August 2006 |language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1991 — [[Ptichka (spacecraft)|Orbiter K2 ''Ptichka'']] unmanned first flight, duration 1–2 days.
* 1992 — [[Ptichka (spacecraft)|Orbiter K2 ''Ptichka'']] unmanned second flight, duration 7–8 days. Orbital maneuvers and space station approach test.
* 1993 — [[1.01 (Buran-class spacecraft)|Orbiter K1 ''Buran'']] unmanned second flight, duration 15–20 days.
* 1994 — [[2.01 (Buran-class spacecraft)|Orbiter K3 ''Baikal'']] first manned space test flight, duration of 24 hours. Craft equipped with life-support system and with two ejection seats. Crew would consist of two cosmonauts with [[Igor Volk]] as commander, and [[Aleksandr Ivanchenko]] as flight engineer.
* Second manned space test flight, crew would consist of two cosmonauts.
* Third manned space test flight, crew would consist of two cosmonauts.
* Fourth manned space test flight, crew would consist of two cosmonauts.

The planned unmanned second flight of ''Ptichka'' was changed in 1991 to the following:
* December 1991 — [[Ptichka (spacecraft)|Orbiter K2 ''Ptichka'']] unmanned second flight, with a duration of 7–8 days. Orbital maneuvers and space station approach test:
** automatic docking with [[Mir]]'s [[Kristall]] module
** crew transfer from Mir to the shuttle, with testing of some of its systems in the course of twenty-four hours, including the remote manipulator
** undocking and autonomous flight in orbit
** docking of the manned [[Soyuz-TM]] 101 with the shuttle
** crew transfer from the Soyuz to the shuttle and onboard work in the course of twenty-four hours
** automatic undocking and landing

=== Cancellation of the programme 1993 ===
[[File:Moscow Gorky Park View from Frunzenskaya Embankment 06.jpg|thumb|Amusement rides and ''Buran shuttle test vehicle OK-7M/OK-TVA'' at [[Gorky Park (Moscow)|Gorky Park]] in Moscow.]]
After the first flight of a Buran shuttle, the project was suspended due to lack of funds and the political situation in the Soviet Union. The two subsequent orbiters, which were due in 1990 (informally [[Ptichka (spacecraft)|''Ptichka'']]) and 1992 (informally [[2.01 (Buran-class spacecraft)|''Baikal'']]) were never completed. The project was officially terminated on 30 June 1993, by President [[Boris Yeltsin]]. At the time of its cancellation, 20 billion [[Soviet ruble|rubles]] (roughly US$71,534,000&lt;!--unlikely--&gt;){{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} had been spent on the Buran programme.&lt;ref name="cancellation"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astronautix.com/details/yelt5401.htm |title=Yeltsin cancels Buran project |work=[[Encyclopedia Astronautica]] |first=Mark |last=Wade |accessdate=2 July 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630161703/http://astronautix.com/details/yelt5401.htm |archivedate=30 June 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The programme was designed to boost national pride, carry out research, and meet technological objectives similar to those of the U.S. Space Shuttle programme, including resupply of the [[Mir]] space station, which was launched in 1986 and remained in service until 2001. When Mir was [[STS-71|finally visited]] by a space shuttle, the visitor was a [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|U.S. Shuttle]], not Buran.

The Buran SO, a docking module that was to be used for rendezvous with the Mir space station, was refitted for use with the U.S. Space Shuttles during the [[Shuttle–Mir]] missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/mirodule.htm |title=Mir-Shuttle Docking Module |work=[[Encyclopedia Astronautica]] |first=Mark |last=Wade |accessdate=16 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100108043835/http://astronautix.com/craft/mirodule.htm |archivedate=8 January 2010 |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Baikonur hangar collapse ====
On 12 May 2002, a [[hangar]] roof at the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] in [[Kazakhstan]] collapsed because of a [[structural failure]] due to poor maintenance. The collapse killed 8 workers and destroyed one of the Buran craft ([[1.01 (Buran-class spacecraft)|Orbiter K1]]), as well as a [[mock-up]] of an Energia booster rocket.  It was not clear to outsiders at the time which Buran programme craft was destroyed, and the BBC reported that it was just "a model" of the orbiter.&lt;ref name="buran-bbcColapse"/&gt; It occurred at the ''MIK RN/MIK 112'' building at Site 112 of the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]], 14 years after the [[Shuttle Buran#First flight|first and only Buran flight]]. Work on the roof had begun for a maintenance project, whose equipment is thought to have contributed to the collapse. Also, before the day of collapse, there had been several days of heavy rain.{{sfn|Hendrickx|Vis|2007}}

== Revival possibilities ==
Over time, several scientists looked into trying to revive the ''Buran'' programme, especially after the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster]].&lt;ref name="baltimoresun"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/bal-te.russia05feb05,0,4512690,full.story |title=Russian space program is handed new responsibility |work=[[The Baltimore Sun]] |first=Douglas |last=Birch |date=5 February 2003 |accessdate=17 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203022532/http://www.baltimoresun.com/bal-te.russia05feb05,0,4512690,full.story |archive-date=3 December 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2003 grounding of the U.S. [[Space Shuttle]]s caused many to wonder whether the Russian Energia launcher or Buran shuttle could be brought back into service.&lt;ref name=NBC-2005-Oberg/&gt;  By then, however, all of the equipment for both (including the vehicles themselves) had fallen into disrepair or been repurposed after falling into disuse with the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]].

In 2010 the director of Moscow's Central Machine Building Institute said the ''Buran'' project would be reviewed in the hope of restarting a similar manned spacecraft design, with rocket test launches as soon as 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Russia_To_Review_Its_Space_Shuttle_Project_999.html |title=Russia To Review Its Space Shuttle Project |publisher=Space Daily |agency=Xinhua |date= |accessdate=28 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia also continues work on the [[Prospective Piloted Transport System|PPTS]] but has abandoned the [[Kliper]] program, due to differences in vision with its European partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://current.com/items/89670174/soviet_space_shuttle_could_bail_out_nasa.htm |title=Soviet space shuttle could bail out NASA |publisher=Current.com |date=31 December 2008 |accessdate=15 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120708030226/http://current.com/items/89670174/soviet_space_shuttle_could_bail_out_nasa.htm |archivedate=8 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.russiatoday.com/scitech/news/33330?gclid=CJSjwpD2qJgCFQEpGgod_jeUnA |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130105030501/http://www.russiatoday.com/scitech/news/33330?gclid=CJSjwpD2qJgCFQEpGgod_jeUnA |dead-url=yes |archive-date=5 January 2013 |title=Soviet space shuttle could bail out NASA |publisher=Russia Today |date= |accessdate=15 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://en.rian.ru/russia/20090129/119870166.html |title=Russia, Europe abandon joint space project — Roscosmos |publisher=RIA Novosti |date= |accessdate=29 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the [[Space Shuttle retirement|2011 retirement of the American Space Shuttle]] and the need for STS-type craft in the meantime to complete the International Space Station, some American and Russian scientists had been mulling over plans to possibly revive the already-existing Buran shuttles in the Buran programme rather than spend money on an entirely new craft and wait for it to be fully developed&lt;ref name="baltimoresun" /&gt;&lt;ref name=NBC-2005-Oberg&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/8148275/page/3/ |title=Russia ready to take lead on space station |work=NBC News |first=James |last=Oberg |date=10 June 2005 |accessdate=16 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the plans did not come to fruition.

On the 25th anniversary of the ''Buran'' flight in November 2013, [[Oleg Ostapenko]], the new head of [[Roscosmos]], the Russian Federal Space Agency, proposed that a new [[heavy lift launch vehicle]] be built for the Russian space program. The rocket would be intended to place a payload of {{convert|100|tonne|lb}} in a baseline [[low Earth orbit]] and is projected to be based on the [[Angara (rocket family)|Angara]] launch vehicle technology.&lt;ref name=sd20131119a&gt;{{cite news |title=Russia starts ambitious super-heavy space rocket project |url=http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Russia_starts_ambitious_super_heavy_space_rocket_project_999.html |accessdate=13 December 2013 |newspaper=Space Daily |date=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- some of these claims are rather stunning, so am including an extended quotation so we don't lose these down the memory hole if that media source subsequently goes offline.

Unlike the US Space Shuttle, which was propelled by a combination of solid boosters and the shuttle orbiter's own liquid-fuel engines fueled from a large fuel tank, the Soviet/Russian shuttle system used thrust from the rocket's four [[RD-170]] liquid oxygen/kerosene engines developed by [[Valentin Glushko]] and another four [[RD-0120]] liquid oxygen/liquid hydrogen engines.{{citation needed|date = November 2012}}

=== Buran and the US Space Shuttle ===
[[File:Soyuz, Space Shuttle, Buran comparison.svg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Soyuz, Space Shuttle, and Buran&lt;/center&gt;]]

==== Comparison to NASA's Space Shuttle ====
{{refimprove section|date=April 2010}}
Because Buran's debut followed that of {{OV|102}}{{'s}}, and because there were striking visual similarities between the two shuttle systems—a state of affairs which recalled the similarity between the [[Tupolev Tu-144]] and [[Concorde]] supersonic airliners—many speculated that [[Cold War]] [[espionage]] played a role in the development of the Soviet shuttle. Despite remarkable external similarities, many key differences existed, which suggests that, had espionage been a factor in Buran's development, it would likely have been in the form of external photography or early airframe designs. One CIA commenter states that Buran was based on a rejected NASA design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/96unclass/farewell.htm |title=The Farewell Dossier: Duping the Soviets – A Deception Operation |journal=Studies in Intelligence |publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]] |first=Gus W. |last=Weiss |volume=39 |issue=5 |year=1996 |accessdate=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  See the {{section link||Programme development}} section above.

==== Key differences between Buran and NASA's Space Shuttle ====
* Buran had no main engines; take off and ascent trajectory were accomplished with the Energia rocket whose four main engines were expendable. The three [[Space Shuttle main engine]]s were part of the orbiter, and were reused for multiple flights.
* The core Energia rocket was equipped with its own [[guidance, navigation, and control]] system - unlike Space Shuttle whose entire control system was in the orbiter.
* Unlike Space Shuttle's boosters, each of Energia's four boosters had their own guidance, navigation, and control system, which allowed them to be used as launch vehicles on their own to deliver smaller payloads than those requiring the complete Energia-Buran system.
* Energia could be configured with four, two or no boosters for payloads other than Buran, and in full configuration was able to put up to 100 metric tons into orbit. The [[Space Shuttle orbiter]] was integral to its launch system and was the system's only payload.
* Energia's four [[Zenit (rocket family)#Energia booster|boosters]] used [[Liquid rocket propellant|liquid propellant]] ([[kerosene]]/[[oxygen]]).

* The liquid fueled booster rockets were not constructed in segments vulnerable to leakage through O-rings, which caused the destruction of {{OV|099|full=no}}.
* The Energia rocket was not covered in foam, the shedding of which from the large fuel tank led to the destruction of {{OV|102|full=no}}.
* Energia's four boosters were designed to be recovered after each flight, though they were not recovered during Energia's two operational flights. The Space Shuttle's boosters were recovered and reused.
* Buran's equivalent of the [[Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System]] used GOX/LOX/Kerosene propellant, with lower toxicity and higher performance (a [[specific impulse]] of {{convert|362|isp}} using a [[turbopump]] system)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buran.ru/htm/odu.htm |title=Объединенная двигательная установка (ОДУ) |trans-title=Joint Propulsion System (JPS) |work=Buran.ru |first=Vadim |last=Lukashevich |accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; than the Shuttle's pressure-fed [[monomethylhydrazine]]/[[dinitrogen tetroxide]] OMS engines.
* Buran was designed to be capable of both [[manned spaceflight|piloted]] and fully [[Robotic spacecraft|autonomous]] flight, including landing. The Space Shuttle was later retrofitted with [[Remote Control Orbiter|automated landing capability]], first flown 18 years after the Buran on [[STS-121]], but the system was intended to be used only in contingencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.space.com/2560-shuttle-carry-tools-repair-remote-control-landing.html |title=Shuttle to Carry Tools for Repair and Remote-Control Landing |work=Space.com |first=Tariq |last=Malik |date=29 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The nose landing gear was located much farther back on the fuselage rather than just under the mid-deck as with the NASA Space Shuttle.
* Buran could lift 30 metric tons into orbit in its standard configuration, comparable to the early Space Shuttle's original 27.8 metric tons&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/shuttle.htm |title=Shuttle |work=[[Encyclopedia Astronautica]] |first=Mark |last=Wade |accessdate=20 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Aerospace&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/spacecraft/q0153.shtml |title=Soviet Buran Space Shuttle |work=Aerospaceweb.org |first=Jeff |last=Scott |date=5 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Buran included a drag chute, the Space Shuttle did not originally but was later retrofitted to include one.
* The [[lift-to-drag ratio]] of Buran is cited as 6.5,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buran.ru/htm/molniya.htm |title="Molniya" Research &amp; Industrial Corporation |work=Buran.ru |accessdate=20 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared to a subsonic L/D of 4.5 for the Space Shuttle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19850008580 |title=Space Shuttle Technical Conference, Part 1 |publisher=NASA |editor-first=Norman |editor-last=Chaffee |page=258 |year=1985 |id=N85-16889}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Civil–military relations''' ('''Civ-Mil or CMR''') describes the relationship between civil society as a whole and the military organization or organizations established to protect it. CMR is an umbrella concept that incorporates a diverse, often normative field, which moves within and across management, social science and policy scales. &lt;ref&gt;Shields, Patricia, (2015) "Civil Military Relations" in ''Encyclopedia of Public Administration and Public Policy, Third edition'' Taylor and Francis DOI: 10.1081/E-EPAP3-120052814&lt;/ref&gt; More narrowly, it describes the relationship between the civil authority of a given society and its military authority. Studies of civil-military relations often rest on a normative assumption that [[civilian control of the military]] is preferable to military control of the state, although some analyses are more descriptive in nature.

A paradox lies at the center of traditional civil-military relations theory. The military, an institution designed to protect the polity, must also be strong enough to threaten the society it serves. A military take-over or coup is a worst-case example.  Ultimately, the military must accept that civilian authorities have the "right to be wrong".&lt;ref&gt;Peter D. Feaver. 2003. ''Armed Servants: Agency, Oversight, and Civil-Military Relations''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt;  In other words, they may be responsible for carrying out a policy decision they disagree with. Civilian supremacy over the military is a complicated matter. The rightness or wrongness of a policy or decision can be ambiguous. Civilian decision makers may be impervious to corrective information. The relationship between civilian authorities and military leaders must be worked out in practice.&lt;ref&gt;Shields, Patricia. 2006. Civil-Military Relations: Changing Frontiers (Review Essay). ''[[Public Administration Review]]''. 66(6): 924-928 https://www.academia.edu/1189403/Review_Essay_Civil_Military_Relations_Changing_Frontiers&lt;/ref&gt;  

The principal problem they examine, however, is empirical: to explain how civilian control over the military is established and maintained.&lt;ref&gt;James Burk. 2002. "Theories of Democratic Civil-Military Relations." ''[http://afs.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/29/1/7 Armed Forces &amp; Society]''. 29(1): 7–29.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Herspring, Dale. 2005. The Pentagon and the Presidency: Civil-Military Relations from FDR to George W. Bush (Lawrence, KS: University Press of Kansas) {{ISBN|0700613552}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the broader sense it examines the ways society and military intersect or interact and includes topics such as the integration of veterans into society, methods used to recruit and retain service members, and the fairness and efficacy of these systems, the integration of minorities, women, and the [[LGBT]] community into the military, the behavior and consequences of private contractors, the role of culture in military organizations, voting behavior of soldiers and veterans, and the gaps in policy preferences between citizen and soldiers. &lt;ref&gt;Shields, Patricia, (2015) "Civil Military Relations" in ''Encyclopedia of Public Administration and Public Policy, Third edition'' Taylor and Francis DOI: 10.1081/E-EPAP3-120052814  https://www.academia.edu/31740598/Civil-Military_Relations &lt;/ref&gt;

While generally not considered a separate academic area of study in and of itself, it involves scholars and practitioners from many fields and specialties. Apart from [[political science]] and [[sociology]], Civ-Mil (CMR) draws upon such diverse fields as [[international law|law]], [[philosophy]], [[area studies]], [[psychology]], [[cultural studies]], [[anthropology]], [[economics]], history, [[diplomatic history]], [[journalism]], and the [[military]], among others. It involves study and discussion of a diverse range of issues including but not limited to: [[civilian control of the military]], [[military professionalism]], war, [[civil-military operations]], [[military institutions]], and other related subjects. International in scope, civil-military relations involves discussion and research from across the world. The theoretical discussion can include [[non-state actors]]&lt;ref&gt;Robert Mandel. 2004.

==History==
{{See also|History of civil-military relations in Southeast Asia}}
The history of civil-military relations can be traced to the writings of [[Sun Tzu]]&lt;ref&gt;Sun Tzu. 1971. ''The Art of War''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Carl von Clausewitz]],&lt;ref name="Clausewitz 1989"&gt;Carl von Clausewitz. 1989. ''On War''. Princeton: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; both of whom argued that military organizations were primarily the servants of the [[Sovereign State|state]].

Concerns about a growing [[militarism]] in society, largely coming from the experiences of the first half of the twentieth century, engendered an examination into the impact of military organizations within society.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Vagts. 1937. ''A History of Militarism: A Romance and Realities of a Profession''. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pearl S. Buck 1949"&gt;Pearl S. Buck, et al. 1949. "New Evidence of the Militarization of America." National Council Against Conscription.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ramifications of the [[Cold War]], specifically the American decision to maintain a large [[standing army]] for the first time in its history, led to concerns about whether such a large military structure could be effectively maintained by a liberal democracy. [[Samuel P. Huntington]] and [[Morris Janowitz]] published the seminal books on the subject which effectively brought civil-military relations into [[academia]], particularly in [[political science]] and [[sociology]].&lt;ref name="Samuel P. Huntington 1957"&gt;Samuel P. Huntington. 1957. ''The Soldier and the State; the Theory and Politics of Civil-Military Relations''. Cambridge: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Morris Janowitz 1960"&gt;Morris Janowitz. 1960. ''The Professional Soldier: A Social and Political Portrait''. Glencoe, Illinois: Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Despite the peculiarly American impetus for Huntington's and Janowitz's writing, their theoretical arguments have been used in the study of other national civil-military studies. For example, Ayesha Ray used the ideas of Huntington in her book about Indian civil-military relations.&lt;ref&gt;Ayesha Ray. 2013. ''The Soldier and the State in India: Nuclear Weapons, Counterinsurgency, and the Transformation of Indian Civil-Military Relations.'' London: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''The Man on Horseback'', [[Samuel E. Finer]] countered some of Huntington's arguments and assumption and offered a look into the civil-military relationships in the [[Least Developed Countries|under-developed world]]. Finer observed that many governments do not have the administrative skills to efficiently govern which may open opportunities for military intervention—opportunities that are not as likely in more developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel E. Finer. 1988. ''The Man on Horseback: The Role of the Military in Politics''. Boulder, Colorado: Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The increased incidence of military [[coups d'état]] since World War II, particularly in the 1960s and 1970s, brought about a growing interest in academic and journalistic circles in studying the nature of such [[coups]]. Political upheaval in Africa led to military take-overs in [[Dahomey]], [[Togo]], [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]], and [[Uganda]], to mention just a few.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Decalo. 1976. ''Coups and Army Rule in Africa: Studies in Military Style''. New Haven: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Political unrest in South America, which involved military coups in [[Bolivia]] (189 military coups in its first 169 years of existence), [[Chile]], [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Paraguay]], [[Peru]], and [[Uruguay]], was largely a result of forces attempting to stem the increasing influence of left-wing and communist led uprisings.&lt;ref&gt;Charles F. Andrain. 1994. ''Comparative Political Systems: Policy Performance and Social Change''. Armonk, New York: M. E. Sharpe.&lt;/ref&gt; The 2006 military coup in [[Thailand]] engendered continued interest in this area.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Beeson. 2008. "Civil-Military Relations in Indonesia and the Philippines: Will the Thai Coup Prove Contagious?" ''[http://afs.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/34/3/474 Armed Forces &amp; Society]''. 34(3): 474–490.&lt;/ref&gt;

The end of the [[Cold War]] led to new debate about to the proper role of the military in society, both in the United States and in the former Soviet Union. However, as before, much of the discussion revolved around whether the power of the state was in decline and whether an appropriate level of civilian control was being brought to bear on the military.&lt;ref&gt;Michael C. Desch. 1998. "Soldiers, States, and Structures: The End of the Cold War and Weakening U.S. Civilian Control." Armed Forces &amp; Society. 24(3): 389–405.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael C. Desch. 2001. ''Civilian Control of the Military: The Changing Security Environment''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomew H. Sparrow and Donald S. Inbody. 2005.

==Professional organization and journal==
[[File:Inter-University Seminar on Armed Forces and Society (logo).gif|thumb|150px|right|upright|Inter-University Seminar on Armed Forces and Society]]
The principal professional organization for civil-military scholars is the [https://web.archive.org/web/20061208145339/http://www.iusafs.org/ Inter-University Seminar on Armed Forces and Society] (IUS). The IUS sponsors [http://afs.sagepub.com/ ''Armed Forces &amp; Society: An Interdisciplinary Journal''] which publishes articles on civil-military relations, force diversity, veterans, military families, privatization, officer training, recruitment and retention, public opinion, conflict management, unit cohesion, ethics, and peacemaking. The journal ''[[Armed Forces &amp; Society]]'' is located at [[Texas State University]] and is currently edited by [[Patricia M. Shields]]. The [[Inter-University Seminar on Armed Forces and Society]] and the journal are international in scope. They have a conference every other year in odd years. The 2017 conference was held in Reston VA. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.iusafs.org/conferences/conferences.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

The topics of research in Civil-Military Relations are varied as evidenced by recent scholarship in such topics as:

==Major theoretical discussions in Civil-military relations==

In 1945, the United States began a demobilization of the massive military force that had been built up during World War II. Strong public and bipartisan pressure succeeded in forcing the government to bring American soldiers home and to reduce the size of the armed forces quickly. Strikes and even some rioting by military personnel at overseas bases in January 1946 pressured President [[Harry S. Truman]] to continue the process despite growing concern about the Soviet Union and an increasing recognition that the United States was not going to be able to retreat into the isolationism of the pre-war years. Attempts in the [[United States Congress]] to continue [[Conscription in the United States|conscription]] to provide a trained reserve as a replacement for a large standing military force failed and, in 1947, the World War II draft law expired.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Pollard. 1985. ''Economic Security and the Origins of the Cold War, 1945–1950''. New York: Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John W. Chambers. 1987. ''To Raise an Army: The Draft Comes to Modern America''. New York: Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George Q. Flynn. 2000. ''The Draft, 1940–1973''. Lawrence, Kansas: University of Kansas Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the summer of 1950, the armed forces of the United States had fewer than 1.5 million personnel on active duty, down from a high of 12 million in 1945. By the next year, however, in response to [[North Korea]]'s invasion of [[South Korea]], the size of the U.S. military was again on the rise, doubling to more than 3.2 million personnel. Reaching a high of 3.6 million in 1953, the total number of personnel on active duty in the U.S. military never again dropped below two million during the 40-plus years of the [[Cold War]]. After the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] and the collapse of the Soviet Union, the size of the active-duty force had, by 1999, dropped to just under 1.4 million personnel. As of February 28, 2009, a total of 1,398,378 men and women remain on active duty in the U.S. armed forces.

The size of the U.S. military in the latter half of the twentieth century, unprecedented in peacetime, caused concern in some circles, primarily as to the potential effect of maintaining such a large force in a democratic society. Some predicted disaster and were concerned with the growing militarization of American society. These writers were quite sure that a distinctly military culture was inherently dangerous to a non-militaristic liberal society.&lt;ref name="Pearl S. Buck 1949"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fred J. Cook. 1962.

London: Gordon and Breach, Science Publishers, Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; Others warned that the ascendancy of the military establishment would fundamentally change American foreign policy and would weaken the intellectual fabric of the country.&lt;ref&gt;C. Wright Mills. 1956. ''The Power Elite''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. Wright Mills. 1958. ''The Causes of World War III''. New York: Simon and Schuster, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; However, most of the arguments were less apocalyptic and settled along two tracks. The two tracks are highlighted, respectively, by Samuel P. Huntington's ''Soldier and the State'' and Morris Janowitz's ''The Professional Soldier''.

The debate focused primarily on the nature of the relationship between the civilian and military worlds. There was widespread agreement that there were two distinct worlds and that they were fundamentally different from one another. The argument was over how best to ensure that the two could coexist without endangering [[liberal democracy]].

===Institutional theory===
[[Image:Samuel P. Huntington (2004 World Economic Forum).jpg|thumb|200px|right|upright|Samuel P. Huntington]]

In his seminal 1957 book on civil-military relations, ''[[The Soldier and the State]]'',&lt;ref name="Samuel P. Huntington 1957"/&gt; [[Samuel P. Huntington]] described the differences between the two worlds as a contrast between the attitudes and values held by military personnel, mostly [[Conservatism|conservative]], and those held by civilians, mostly [[Liberalism|liberal]].&lt;ref&gt;William T.R. Fox. 1961. "Representativeness and Efficiency: Dual Problem of Civil-Military Relations" ''Political Science Quarterly'' 76(3): 354–366.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Karsten. 1971. "ROTC, MyLai and the Volunteer Army." ''Foreign Policy'' 6 (Spring).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="M. Vincent Hayes 1973"&gt;M. Vincent Hayes(ed). 1973. "Is the Military Taking Over?" ''New Priorities: a Magazine for Activists''. 1(4). London: Gordon and Breach, Science Publishers, Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; Each world consisted of a separate institution with its own operative rules and norms. The military's function was furthermore inherently different from that of the civilian world. Given a more conservative military world which was illiberal in many aspects, it was necessary to find a method of ensuring that the liberal civilian world would be able to maintain its dominance over the military world. Huntington's answer to this problem was "military professionalism."

Huntington focused his study on the officer corps. He first defined a profession and explained that enlisted personnel, while certainly part of the military world, are not, strictly speaking, professionals. He relegated them to the role of tradesmen or skilled craftsmen, necessary but not professionals in his definition of the term. It was professional military officers, not the enlisted technicians of the trade of violence, or even the part-time or amateur reserve officers extant in the mid-1950s (as opposed to the near "part-time 'regular' " status characterizing reserve officers with extensive active duty experience, professional military education, and active combat experience in the post-[[Gulf War]] period), who would be the key to controlling the military world.

Professionalizing the military, or at least the officer corps, which is the decision-making authority within the military world, emphasizes the useful aspects of that institution such as discipline, structure, order, and self-sacrifice. It also isolates the corps in a specialized arena in which the military professionals would be recognized as experts in the use of force. As recognized experts not subject to the interference of the civilian world, the military's officer corps would willingly submit itself to civil authority. In Huntington's words, such an arrangement maintained a "focus on a politically neutral, autonomous, and professional officer corps."&lt;ref&gt;Samuel P. Huntington. 1957. ''The Soldier and the State; the Theory and Politics of Civil-Military Relations''. Cambridge: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, viii.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order for the civilian authority to maintain control, it needed to have a way to direct the military without unduly infringing on the prerogatives of the military world and thus provoking a backlash. Civilian leadership would decide the objective of any military action but then leave it to the military world to decide upon the best way of achieving the objective. The problem facing civilian authority, then, is in deciding on the ideal amount of control. Too much control over the military could result in a force too weak to defend the nation, resulting in failure on the battlefield. Too little control would create the possibility of a coup, i.e., failure of the government.

Huntington's answer to the control dilemma was "objective civilian control." This was in contrast to "subjective control," in which direction would be more intrusive and detailed. To put it simply, the more "objective civilian control," the more military security. Civilian control, then, is the independent variable for the subsequent dependent variable of military effectiveness.

If civilian control is the critical variable for military effectiveness, it raises the question of how civilian control is then to be determined. Huntington identified two shaping forces or imperatives for civilian control – (1) functional and (2) societal. He broke the societal imperative into two components, ideology and structure. By ideology, he meant a world-view or paradigm: liberal anti-military, conservative pro-military, fascist pro-military, and Marxist anti-military. By structure, he meant the legal-constitutional framework that guided political affairs generally and civil-military affairs specifically.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel P. Huntington. 1957. ''The Soldier and the State; the Theory and Politics of Civil-Military Relations''. Cambridge: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 79, 92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter D. Feaver. 1996. "An American Crisis in Civilian Control and Civil-Military Relations?" ''The Tocqueville Review''. 17(1): 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Huntington and early studies of civil-military relationships, it is considered that effective civil-military relations should be in the form of objective civilian control over their armed forces. This control is indicated by the following factors; (1) the military's adoption of professional ethos and their recognition of boundaries of professional roles, (2) effective subordination of the military to civilian political leadership that formulates strategic directives on foreign and military policies, (3) recognition and approval from political leaders to the professional authorities and autonomy of the military and (4) minimal intervention of the military in politics and of politicians in military affairs.

If Huntington's imperatives are the independent variables, then the variable of civilian control becomes, in turn, an explanatory variable for military security. However, Huntington says that both societal imperatives, ideology, and structure, are unchanging, at least in the American case. If that is the case, then the functional imperative is fully explanatory for changes in civilian control and subsequently military security. In short, if external threats are low, liberal ideology "extirpates" or eliminates military forces. If external threats are high, liberal ideology produces a "transmutation" effect that will re-create the military in accordance with liberalism, but in such a form that it will lose its "peculiarly military characteristics." Transmutation will work for short periods, such as to fight a war, but will not, over time, assure military security.&lt;ref&gt;Peter D. Feaver. 1996. "An American Crisis in Civilian Control and Civil-Military Relations?" ''The Tocqueville Review''. 17(1): 159–182.&lt;/ref&gt; This appears to explain well the pattern of American militarization and demobilization, at least until the initiation of the Cold War.

With the understanding that the rise of the Soviet Union created a long-term threat, Huntington concluded that the liberal society of the United States would fail to create adequate military forces to ensure security over the long term. The only circumstance he could foresee that would permit adequate military security was for the United States to change the societal imperative. "The tension between the demands of military security and the values of American liberalism can, in the long run, be relieved only by the weakening of the security threat or the weakening of liberalism."&lt;ref&gt;Samuel P. Huntington. 1957. ''The Soldier and the State; the Theory and Politics of Civil-Military Relations''. Cambridge: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 457.&lt;/ref&gt; The only way the United States could adequately provide security in the face of a long-term threat such as the Soviet Union, in other words, was for American society to become more conservative.

===Convergence theory===
The other principal thread within the civil-military theoretical debate was that generated in 1960 by [[Morris Janowitz]] in ''The Professional Soldier''.&lt;ref name="Morris Janowitz 1960"/&gt; Janowitz agreed with Huntington that separate military and civilian worlds existed, but differed from his predecessor regarding the ideal solution for preventing danger to liberal democracy. Since the military world as he saw it was fundamentally conservative, it would resist change and not adapt as rapidly as the more open and unstructured civilian society to changes in the world. Thus, according to Janowitz, the military would benefit from exactly what Huntington argued against – outside intervention.

Janowitz introduced a theory of convergence, arguing that the military, despite the extremely slow pace of change, was in fact changing even without external pressure. Convergence theory postulated either a civilianization of the military or a militarization of society &lt;ref name="Irving Louis Horowitz 1963"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Judith Nies McFadden 1969"/&gt;&lt;ref name="M. Vincent Hayes 1973"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gene Lyons. 1961. "The New Civil-Military Relations." ''American Political Science Review'' 55(1).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harold Wool. 1968. ''The Military Specialist''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite this convergence, Janowitz insisted that the military world would retain certain essential differences from the civilian and that it would remain recognizably military in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Morris Janowitz. 1973. "The Social Demography of the All-Volunteer Force." ''Annals of the American Academy of Political Science''. 406(March): 86–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Janowitz agreed with Huntington that, because of the fundamental differences between the civilian and military worlds, clashes would develop which would diminish the goal of civilian control of the military. His answer was to ensure that convergence occurred, thus ensuring that the military world would be imbued with the norms and expectations of the society that created it. He encouraged use of conscription, which would bring a wide variety of individuals into the military. He also encouraged the use of more [[Reserve Officer Training Corps]] (ROTC) programs at colleges and universities to ensure that the [[military academies]] did not have a monopoly on the type of officer, particularly the senior [[general officer]] and [[flag officer]] leadership positions, in the military services. He specifically encouraged the development of ROTC programs in the more elite universities, so that the broader influences of society would be represented by the officer corps. The more such societal influences present within the military culture, the smaller the attitudinal differences between the two worlds and the greater the chance of civilians maintaining control over the military. Janowitz, like Huntington, believed that the civilian and military worlds were different from one another; while Huntington developed a theory to control the difference, Janowitz developed a theory to diminish the difference.

In response to Huntington's position on the functional imperative, Janowitz concluded that in the new nuclear age, the United States was going to have to be able to deliver both strategic deterrence and an ability to participate in limited wars. Such a regime, new in American history, was going to require a new military self-conception, the constabulary concept: "The military establishment becomes a constabulary force when it is continuously prepared to act, committed to the minimum use of force, and seeks viable international relations, rather than victory..."&lt;ref&gt;Morris Janowitz. 1960. ''The Professional Soldier: A Social and Political Portrait''. Glencoe, Illinois: Free Press., 418.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter D. Feaver. 1996. "The Civil-Military Problematique: Huntington, Janowitz and the Question of Civilian Control." ''[http://afs.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/23/2/149 Armed Forces and Society]''. 23(2): 149–178.&lt;/ref&gt; Under this new concept of the military establishment, distinctions between war and peace are more difficult to draw. The military, instead of viewing itself as a fire company to be called out in emergency, would then be required to imagine itself in the role of a police force, albeit on the international level rather than domestically. The role of the civilian elite would be to interact closely with the military elite so as to ensure a new and higher standard of professional military education, one that would ensure that military professionals were more closely attuned to the ideals and norms of civilian society.

===Institutional/occupational hypothesis===
[[Charles Moskos]] developed the institutional/occupational (I/O) hypothesis as a means to promote comparative historical studies of military organization and military change. This hypothesis evolved into the [[Postmodern Military Model]], which helped predict the course of civil-military relations after the end of the [[Cold War]]. The I/O hypothesis argued that the military was moving away from an institutional model towards one that was more occupational in nature. An institutional model presents the military as an organization highly divergent from civilian society while an occupational model presents the military more convergent with civilian structures. While Moskos did not propose that the military was ever "entirely separate or entirely coterminous with civilian society", the use of a scale helped better to highlight the changing interface between the armed forces and society.&lt;ref&gt;Charles C. Moskos. 1977. "From Institution to Occupation: Trends in Military Organization." ''[http://afs.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/4/1/41 Armed Forces &amp; Society]''. 4(1): 41–50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles C. Moskos. 1986. "Institutional/Occupational Trends in Armed Forces: An Update." ''[http://afs.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/12/3/377 Armed Forces &amp; Society]''. 12(3):377.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agency theory===
The [[Vietnam War]] opened deep arguments about civil-military relations that continue to exert powerful influences today. One centered on a contention within military circles that the United States lost the war because of unnecessary civilian meddling in military matters. It was argued that the civilian leadership failed to understand how to use military force and improperly restrained the use of force in achieving victory. Among the first to analyze the war critically was [[Harry Summers]]&lt;ref&gt;Harry G. Summers. 1984. ''On Strategy: A Critical Analysis of the Vietnam War''. New York: Dell Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;, who used [[Clausewitz]] as his theoretical basis. He argued that the principal reason for the loss of the [[Vietnam War]] was a failure on the part of the political leadership to understand the goal, which was victory. The Army, always successful on the battlefield, ultimately did not achieve victory because it was misused and misunderstood. Summers argued that the conduct of the war violated many classical principals as described by Clausewitz,&lt;ref name="Clausewitz 1989"/&gt; thereby contributing to failure. He ended his analysis with a "quintessential strategic lesson learned": that the Army must become "masters of the profession of arms," thus reinforcing an idea along the lines of Huntington's argument for strengthening military professionalism.

[[H.R. McMaster]]&lt;ref&gt;H.R. McMaster. 1998. ''[[Dereliction of Duty: Lyndon Johnson, Robert McNamara, The Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Lies that Led to Vietnam]]''. New York: Harper Perennia.&lt;/ref&gt; observed that it was easier for officers in the [[Gulf War]] to connect national policy to the actual fighting than was the case during Vietnam. He concluded that the Vietnam War had actually been lost in Washington, D.C., before any fighting occurred, due to a fundamental failure on the part of the civilian and military actors involved to argue the issues adequately. McMaster, who urged a more direct debate between civilians and the military on defense policy and actions, and Summers, who argued for a clear separation between civilians and the military, both pointed out controversies over the proper roles of civilian and military leaders.

Despite those controversies and the apparent lessons learned from the Vietnam War, some theorists recognized a significant problem with Huntington's theory insofar as it appears to question the notion of a separate, apolitical professional military. While there is little argument that separate civilian and military worlds exist, there is significant debate about the proper interaction between the two. As discussed above, Huntington proposed that the ideal arrangement was one whereby civilian political leaders provided objective control to the military leadership and then stepped back to permit the experts in violence to do what was most effective. He further stated that the most dangerous arrangement was one whereby civilian leaders intruded extensively in the military world, creating a situation whereby the military leadership was not politically neutral and security of the nation was thus threatened both by an ineffective military and by provoking the military to avoid taking orders.&lt;ref name="Samuel P. Huntington 1957"/&gt;

Arguably, however, and despite Huntington's urging otherwise, U.S. civilian leadership had been intrusive in its control over the military, not only during the Vietnam War, but also during much of the Cold War. During that time, the military elite had been extensively involved in the politics of defense budgets and management, and yet the United States had managed to emerge successfully from the Cold War. Despite that, none of Huntington's more dire predictions had proven true.

In response to this apparent "puzzle," [[Peter D. Feaver]]&lt;ref name="Armed Forces &amp; Society_1998"&gt;Peter D. Feaver. 1998. "Crisis as Shirking: An Agency Theory Explanation of the Souring of American Civil-Military Relations." ''[http://afs.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/24/3/407 ''Armed Forces &amp; Society'']''. 24(3): 407–434.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter D. Feaver. 1996b. "The Civil-Military Problematique: Huntington, Janowitz and the Question of Civilian Control." ''[http://afs.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/23/2/149 ''Armed Forces &amp; Society'']''. 23(2): 149–178.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Peter D. Feaver 2003"&gt;Peter D. Feaver. 2003. ''Armed Servants: Agency, Oversight, and Civil-Military Relations''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; laid out an agency theory of civil-military relations, which he argued should replace Huntington's institutional theory. Taking a rationalist approach, he used a [[principal-agent]] framework, drawn from [[microeconomics]], to explore how actors in a superior position influence those in a subordinate role. He used the concepts of "working" and "shirking" to explain the actions of the subordinate. In his construct, the principal is the civilian leadership that has the responsibility of establishing policy. The agent is the military that will work – carry out the designated task – or shirk – evading the principal's wishes and carrying out actions that further the military's own interests. Shirking at its worst may be disobedience, but Feaver includes such things as "foot-dragging" and leaks to the press.

The problem for the principal is how to ensure that the agent is doing what the principal wants done. Agency theory predicts that if the costs of monitoring the agent are low, the principal will use intrusive methods of control. Intrusive methods include, for the executive branch, such things as inspections, reports, reviews of military plans, and detailed control of the budget, and for Congress, committee oversight hearings and requiring routine reports. For the military agent, if the likelihood that shirking will be detected by the civilian principal is high or if the perceived costs of being punished are too high, the likelihood of shirking is low.

Feaver argued that his theory was different from other theories or models in that it was purely deductive, based on [[democratic theory]] rather than on anecdotal evidence, and better enabled analysis of day-to-day decisions and actions on the part of the civilian and military leadership.&lt;ref name="Peter D. Feaver 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mackubin Thomas Owens. 2003. "Civilian Rumsfeld: Overseeing the Military." ''National Review Online''. http://www.nationalreview.com/owens/owens071703.asp.&lt;/ref&gt; It operated at the intersection of Huntington's institutional approach and Janowitz's sociological point of view. Huntington concentrated on the relationship between civilian leadership and the military qua institution while Janowitz focused on the relationship of the military qua individuals to American society. Agency theory provided a link between the two enabling an explanation of how civil-military relations work on a day-to-day basis. Specifically, agency theory would predict that the result of a regime of intrusive monitoring by the civilian leadership combined with shirking on the part of the military would result in the highest levels of civil-military conflict. Feaver&lt;ref name="Armed Forces &amp; Society_1998"/&gt; suggested that post-Cold War developments had so profoundly reduced the perceived costs of monitoring and reduced the perceived expectation of punishment that the gap between what civilians ask the military to do and what the military would prefer to do had increased to unprecedented levels.

===Concordance theory===
After observing that most civil-military theory assumes that the civilian and military worlds must necessarily be separate, both physically and ideologically, Rebecca L. Schiff offered a new theory—Concordance—as an alternative.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca L. Schiff. 2008. ''The Military and Domestic Politics: A Concordance Theory of Civil-Military Relations''. New York, New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca L. Schiff. 1995. "Civil-Military Relations Reconsidered: A Theory of Concordance." ''[http://afs.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/22/1/7 Armed Forces &amp; Society]''. 22(1): 7–24.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the key questions in Civil-Military Relations (CMR) theory has always been to determine under what conditions the military will intervene in the domestic politics of the nation. Most scholars agree with the theory of objective civilian control of the military (Huntington), which focuses on the separation of civil and military institutions. Such a view concentrates and relies heavily on the U.S. case, from an institutional perspective, and especially during the [[Cold War]] period. Schiff provides an alternative theory, from both institutional and cultural perspectives, that explains the U.S. case as well as several non-U.S. civil-military relations case studies.

While concordance theory does not preclude a separation between the civilian and military worlds, it does not require such a state to exist. She argues that three societal institutions—(1) the [[military]], (2) [[political elite]]s, and (3) the [[citizenry]] must aim for a cooperative arrangement and some agreement on four primary indicators:

# Social composition of the [[officer corps]].
# The political decision-making process.
# The method of recruiting military personnel.
# The style of the military.

If agreement occurs among the three partners with respect to the four indicators, domestic military intervention is less likely to occur. In her book, ''The Military and Domestic Politics'', she applied her theory to six international historical cases studies: U.S., post–Second World War period; American Post-Revolutionary Period (1790–1800); Israel (1980–90); Argentina (1945–55); India post-Independence and 1980s; Pakistan (1958–69).

==Other civil-military relations issues==

===Liberal theory and the American Founding Fathers===

At the heart of civil-military relations is the problem of how a civilian government can control and remain safe from the military institution it created for its own protection. A military force that is strong enough to do what is asked of it must not also pose a danger to the controlling government. This poses the paradox that "because we fear others we create an institution of violence to protect us, but then we fear the very institution we created for protection".&lt;ref&gt;Peter D. Feaver. 1996. "The Civil-Military Problematique: Huntington, Janowitz and the Question of Civilian Control." [http://afs.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/23/2/149 ''Armed Forces &amp; Society'']. 23(2): 149–178.&lt;/ref&gt;

The solution to this problem throughout most of American history was to keep its standing army small, relying on augmentation from militias (the predecessor of modern-day Reserve forces, to include the National Guard) and volunteers. While armed forces were built up during wartime, the pattern after every war up to and including World War II was to demobilize quickly and return to something approaching pre-war force levels. However, with the advent of the Cold War in the 1950s, the need to create and maintain a sizable peacetime military force engendered new concerns of militarism and about how such a large force would affect civil-military relations in the United States. For the first time in American history, the problem of civil-military relations would have to be managed during peacetime.&lt;ref&gt;Donald S. Inbody. 2015. ''The Soldier Vote: War, Politics, and the Ballot in America.'' New York: Palgrave-Macmillan, 101-116.&lt;/ref&gt;

The men who wrote the [[Constitution of the United States]] were fearful of large [[standing armies]], legislatures that had too much power, and perhaps most of all, a powerful executive who might be able to wage war on his own authority. All were objects of concern because of the dangers each posed to [[liberal democracy]] and a free citizenry. While it is often impossible to "gauge accurately the intent of the Framers",&lt;ref&gt;Jack N. Rackove. 1990. ''Interpreting the Constitution: The Debate Over Original Intent''. Boston: Northeastern.&lt;/ref&gt; it is nevertheless important to understand the motivations and concerns of the writers with respect to the appropriate relationship between civil and military authority. The ''Federalist Papers'' provide a helpful view of how they understood the relationship between civil authority, as represented by the executive branch and the legislature, and military authority.

In [[Federalist No. 8]], [[Alexander Hamilton]] worried that maintaining a large [[standing army]] would be a dangerous and expensive undertaking. In his principal argument for the ratification of the proposed constitution, he argued that only by maintaining a strong union could the new country avoid such a pitfall. Using the European experience as a negative example and the British experience as a positive one, he presented the idea of a strong nation protected by a navy with no need of a standing army. The implication was that control of a large military force is, at best, difficult and expensive, and at worst invites war and division. He foresaw the necessity of creating a civilian government that kept the military at a distance.

[[James Madison]], another writer of several of the ''[[Federalist Papers]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Gottfried Dietze. 1960. ''The Federalist: A Classic on Federalism and Free Government''. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press.&lt;/ref&gt; expressed his concern about a standing military in comments before the Constitutional Convention in June 1787:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In time of actual war, great discretionary powers are constantly given to the Executive Magistrate. Constant apprehension of War, has the same tendency to render the head too large for the body. A standing military force, with an overgrown Executive, will not long be safe companions to liberty. The means of defense against foreign danger, have been always the instruments of tyranny at home. Among the Romans it was a standing maxim to excite a war, whenever a revolt was apprehended. Throughout all Europe, the armies kept up under the pretext of defending, have enslaved the people.
&lt;ref&gt;Max Farrand. 1911. ''Records of the Federal Convention of 1787''. New Haven: Yale University Press. 1:465.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[United States Constitution]] placed considerable limitations on the [[legislature]]. Coming from a tradition of legislative superiority in government, many were concerned that the proposed Constitution would place so many limitations on the legislature that it would become impossible for such a body to prevent an executive from starting a war. Hamilton argued in Federalist No. 26 that it would be equally as bad for a legislature to be unfettered by any other agency and that restraints would actually be more likely to preserve liberty. James Madison, in [[Federalist No. 47]], continued Hamilton's argument that distributing powers among the various branches of government would prevent any one group from gaining so much power as to become unassailable. In [[Federalist No. 48]], however, Madison warned that while the separation of powers is important, the departments must not be so far separated as to have no ability to control the others.

Finally, in [[Federalist No. 51]], Madison argued that to create a government that relied primarily on the good nature of the incumbent to ensure proper government was folly. Institutions must be in place to check incompetent or malevolent leaders. Most importantly, no single branch of government ought to have control over any single aspect of governing. Thus, all three branches of government must have some control over the military, and the system of checks and balances maintained among the other branches would serve to help control the military.

Hamilton and Madison thus had two major concerns: (1) the detrimental effect on liberty and democracy of a large standing army and (2) the ability of an unchecked legislature or executive to take the country to war precipitously. These concerns drove American military policy for the first century and a half of the country's existence. Until the 1950s, the maintenance of a large military force by the United States was an exceptional circumstance and was restricted to times of war. Following every war up to and including World War II, the military was quickly demobilized and reduced to near pre-war levels.

===Civilian-military culture gap thesis===

Most debates in civil-military relations assumed that a separation between the civilian and military worlds was inevitable and likely necessary. The argument had been over whether to control the gap between the two worlds (Huntington) or to minimize the gap by enacting certain policies (Janowitz). Following the end of the Cold War in 1989, however, the discussion began to focus on the nature of the apparent gap between civilian and military cultures and, more specifically, whether that gap had reached such proportions as to pose a danger to civilian control of the military. Part of the debate was based on the cultural differences between the more liberal civilian society and the conservative military society, and on the recognition that such differences had apparently become more pronounced than in past years.

[[Alfred Vagts]] had already begun the discussion from an historical point of view, concentrating on the German/Prussian military experience. He was perhaps most influential with his definition of [[militarism]], which he described as the state of a society that "ranks military institutions and ways above the prevailing attitudes of civilian life and carries the military mentality into the civilian sphere."&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Vagts. 1937. ''A History of Militarism: A Romance and Realities of a Profession''. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company., 11–15.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lewis Smith (historian)|Louis Smith]], whose work pre-dated Huntington's, discussed issues of congressional and judicial control over the military as well as executive civilian control of military matters.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Smith. 1951. ''American Democracy and Military Power''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, all that discussion predated a general recognition that the American experience was going to change in the post-World War II era. Once it became apparent that the American military was going to maintain historically high levels of active-duty personnel, concerns about the differences between civilian and military cultures quickly came to the forefront. 

The ensuing debate can be generally divided into three periods with different emphases in each. Much of this discussion is taken from a point paper written by Lindsay P. Cohn while a graduate student at Duke University. Her writing has been widely used as a source of simplifying the analysis of the civil-military gap debate. Dr. Cohn is now on the faculty at the United States Naval War College in Newport, R.I.&lt;ref&gt;Lindsay Cohn. 1999. "[http://www.poli.duke.edu/civmil/cohn_literature_review.pdf The Evolution of the Civil-Military "Gap" Debate]." A paper prepared for the TISS Project on the Gap Between the Military and Civilian Society. The organization for this section is based on Cohn's detailed discussion and survey of the Culture Debate literature.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first period, roughly beginning with the end of World War II and ending in about 1973 with the end of the military draft in the United States, was primarily concerned with defining civil-military relations, understanding the concept of professionalism, and learning how civilians actually controlled the military. As discussed above, Huntington and Janowitz dominated the debate.

The second period started in about 1973, with the end of conscription and the establishment of the [[all-volunteer force]], and continued until the end of the [[Cold War]]. This period was concerned with the supposed lessons of the [[Vietnam War]], how the volunteer force changed the nature of the armed forces, and whether those changes led to wider gaps between military and civilian societies.

The third period, beginning with the end of the [[Cold War]] and continuing today, has seen an increasing interest in and concern about the existence of a "civil-military culture gap." The discussion has centered around four questions:&lt;ref&gt;Donald S. Inbody. 2015. ''The Soldier Vote.'' New York: Palgrave-Macmillan, 101-1216. (See especially chapter 8, American Civil-Military Relations.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Whether such a gap exists in the first place? (Most agree it does.)
# What is the nature of the gap?
# Does the gap matter?
# If it does matter, what is causing it? What changes in policy might be required to mitigate negative effects?

====What is the nature of the gap?====

While the debate surrounding a presumed culture gap between civilian and military societies had continued since at least the early 1950s, it became prominent in the early 1990s with the conclusion of the Cold War. The promised "[[peace dividend]]" led to a debate over changes in American [[National Security Strategy (United States)|national security strategy]] and what that would mean in terms of the transformation of the mission, composition, and character of the armed forces.

The gap debate revolved around two related concepts:

# The notion of a cultural gap, i.e., the differences in the culture, norms, and values of the military and civilian worlds, and
# The notion of a connectivity gap, i.e., the lack of contact and understanding between them.&lt;ref name="poli.duke.edu"&gt;Lindsay Cohn. 1999. "[http://www.poli.duke.edu/civmil/cohn_literature_review.pdf The Evolution of the Civil-Military "Gap" Debate]." A paper prepared for the TISS Project on the Gap Between the Military and Civilian Society.&lt;/ref&gt;

Few argued that there was no difference between the two worlds, but some were convinced that the difference itself was the primary danger. Charles Maynes&lt;ref name="Charles William Maynes 1998"&gt;Charles William Maynes. 1998. "The Perils Of (and For) an Imperial America." ''Foreign Policy''. 111(Summer): 36–47.&lt;/ref&gt; worried that a military force consisting primarily of enlisted personnel from the lower socio-economic classes would ultimately refuse to fight for the goals of the upper classes. Tarr and Roman,&lt;ref&gt;David Tarr and Peter Roman. 1998, October 19. "The Military is Still in Close Contact with Civilians." ''Biloxi Sun Herald''.&lt;/ref&gt; on the other hand, were concerned that the similarities between military elites and civilian elites enabled a dangerous politicizing trend among the military. Chivers&lt;ref&gt;C.J. Chivers. 1999, September 14. "Military Fights an Imaginary Rift With the Public." ''USA Today'', 17&lt;/ref&gt; represented a small number who believed that the differences between the cultures were so small as essentially to be irrelevant.

Reasons for the cultural and connectivity gaps vary widely. The self-selective nature of the [[All-Volunteer Force]] is seen by some to have led to the unrepresentative nature of the armed forces&lt;ref name="Charles William Maynes 1998"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark J. Eitelberg and Roger G. Little. 1995. "Influential Elites and the American Military After the Cold War. ''U.S. Civil-Military Relations: In Crisis or Transition''. ed.s. Donald M. Snider and Miranda A. Carlton-Carew. Washington, D.C.: Center for Strategic and International Studies.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Andrew J 1997"&gt;Andrew J. Bacevich and Richard H. Kohn. 1997. "Grand Army of the Republicans: Has the U.S. Military Become a Partisan Force?" ''The New Republic'' 217 (23-8) Dec): 22 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; One argument, put forward by a Navy Chief of Chaplains, was that the drawdown in the size of the military was exacerbating differences and making the separation between the military and civilian societies potentially even more divisive. He worried that unless an effective dialogue could be maintained between the military and civilian branches of society, especially in the area of ethical decision-making, the American military risked losing the support of society or becoming dangerously militaristic.&lt;ref name="Donald K. Muchow 1995"&gt;Donald K. Muchow. 1995. "A Preliminary Analysis of American Values of Life and Community." ''JSCOPE 95''.&lt;/ref&gt; Others argued that the increase in diversity among military personnel has actually strengthened ties between society and the military, especially those ties weakened by the results of the Vietnam War.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Tasker. 1990, September 27. "Who Are Today's Soldiers – And Why?" ''The Seattle Times'', F1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin Binkin. 1993. ''Who Will Fight the Next War?'' Washington, D.C.: Brookings Institution.&lt;/ref&gt; Most were persuaded that the societal effects of the [[Vietnam War]] remained central to the cultural differences.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Hicks Stiehm. 1996. "The Civilian Mind." in Judith Hicks Stiehm, ed. ''It's Our Military, Too!'' Philadelphia: Temple University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Don M. Snider and Miranda A. Carlton-Carew. ed.s 1995. ''U.S. Civil-Military Relations: In Crisis or Transition?'' Washington, D.C.: The Center for Strategic and International Studies.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George Will. 1997, May 25. "Lott, and Others, Need to Butt Out." ''The Plain Dealer'', 5F. May 25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Danzig. 1999. ''[http://www.navy.mil/navydata/people/secnav/danzig/bigthree.pdf The Big Three: Our Greatest Security Risks and How to Address Them]''. Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs, Syracuse University.&lt;/ref&gt;

One unique view, which does not neatly fall into either of the cultural- or connectivity-gap categories, centers on the organizational differences between the military and civilian societies. This view claims to explain much as to why the military has been or may be used to press ahead of society's norms.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Kier. 1998. "Homosexuals in the U.S. Military: Open Integration and Combat Effectiveness." ''International Security'' 23(2): 5–39.&lt;/ref&gt; This view goes beyond the simpler cultural-gap approach and emphasizes the ability of the military society to control the behavior and attitudes of its members in ways not possible in the more open civilian society, as evidenced by such phenomena as desegregation of the military and inclusion of women in the military.&lt;ref name="poli.duke.edu"/&gt;

====Why does the gap matter?====

Ultimately, the cultural gap matters only if it endangers civilian control of the military or if it reduces the ability of the country to maintain an effective military force. Those who concentrate on the nature of the gap tend not to be concerned about dangerous trends. However, those who are concerned about the lack of understanding between the civilian and military worlds are uniformly convinced that the civil-military relationship in the United States is unhealthy.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew J. Bacevich and Richard H. Kohn. 1997. "Grand Army of the Republicans: Has the U.S. Military Become a Partisan Force?" ''The New Republic''. 217 (23-8) Dec): 22 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C.J. Chivers. 1999, September 14. "Military Fights an Imaginary Rift With the Public." ''USA Today''. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter D. Feaver. 1999. "Civil-Military Relations." ''Annual Review of Political Science''. 2: 211–241.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, they have voiced concerns about a military that may become openly contemptuous of civilian norms and values and may then feel free to openly question the value of defending such a society.&lt;ref&gt;J.F. McIsaac &amp; N. Verdugo. 1995. "Civil-military relations: A domestic perspective." In D. M. Snider &amp; M. A. Carlton-Carew (Eds.), ''U.S. civil-military relations in crisis of transition?'' (pp. 21–33). Washington, D.C.: Center for Strategic and International Studies.&lt;/ref&gt; Others worry whether an inexperienced civilian government will undermine the military by ineffective or inappropriate policies, thus threatening U.S. national security.&lt;ref&gt;Mark J. Eitelberg and Roger G. Little. 1995. "Influential Elites and the American Military After the Cold War." ''U.S. Civil-Military Relations: In Crisis or Transition''. Donald M. Snider and Miranda A. Carlton-Carew (eds). Washington, D.C.: Center for Strategic and International Studies.&lt;/ref&gt;

This debate has generally settled on whether or not the gap is too wide. If too wide, civilian control of the military may be jeopardized due to serious misunderstandings between the two worlds. While most agree that such a gap is to be expected and, in and of itself, is not dangerous, some do concede the aspects of that gap have led directly to misunderstandings between the two worlds. In particular, some have argued that the culture of political conservatism and the apparent increase in partisanship of the officer corps has approached a dangerous limit.&lt;ref name="Andrew J 1997"/&gt; Nearly all agree that it is possible for the cultural gap to be either too wide or too narrow, but there is wide disagreement as to where the current situation rests on that continuum. While Elizabeth Kier&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Kier. 1999. "Discrimination and Military Cohesian: An Organizational Perspective." In Mary Fainsod Katzenstein and Judith Reppy, eds. 1999. ''Beyond Zero Tolerance: Discrimination in Military Culture''. New York: Alexshan Books.&lt;/ref&gt; argues that "structure and function do not determine culture," most agree that a difference between the two is necessary because civilian culture was "incommensurate with military effectiveness."

====Correcting the problem====

Assuming that a problem exists, many have offered suggestions for narrowing the gap and correcting the problems arising from it. In general, those suggestions are along three lines. The first is that the military must reach out to the civilian world. Given the essentially universal agreement that civilians must control the military, the duty falls upon the military to find ways to talk to civilians, not the other way around. The second is that civilians must articulate a clear vision of what they expect in terms of the military mission. And the final suggestion is that the most practical and effective means of bringing about dialogue and understanding is to be bilateral education, in which both military and civilian elites would jointly attend specialized schools. Such schooling would emphasize military-strategic thinking, American history and political philosophy, military ethics, and the proper relationship between civil and military authority.&lt;ref name="poli.duke.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donald K. Muchow. 1995. "A Preliminary Analysis of American Values of Life and Community." [http://isme.tamu.edu/JSCOPE95/ Muchow95.html.] Paper presented at the Proceedings of the Joint Services Conference on Professional Ethics (JSCOPE).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue that the root problem is that the military is self-selecting, rendering the culture a self-perpetuating one. Solutions such as the reinstatement of the draft and a European-style national service obligation have been offered.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas E. Ricks. 1997. ''Making the Corps''. New York: Scribner.&lt;/ref&gt; but none appear to have made any progress toward adoption.

==Contemporary issues==

A  common issue that hinders many civil-military relations is when civil political leaders attempt to resume or gain a certain degree of civilian control after a period of transition, conflict or dictatorship, but do not possess the necessary capacities and commitment to handle defense affairs. What should happen in such transitions is that when military figures begin to be withdrawn from political positions in order to achieve some balance, is that civilian politicians should be taught to deal with policy formulation and given an oversight on the defense sector so as to efficiently replace the former military leaders. However, civilian control over the military, despite the efforts that have been made over the past years, has yet to become institutionalized in many countries.
The challenges that civil-military relations face in many countries, such as Indonesia, center around problems of military culture, overlapping coordination, authority, lack of resources and institutional deficits.
The military cannot continue to be an organization with unmatched institutional reach and political influence, while limiting state capacity, because in doing so it will be evermore challenging for civilian supremacy to take a stance, thus establishing effective civil-military relations. If these problems are not addressed properly, as long as civil-military relations of countries continue to interact within undefined boundaries, without clear subordination and authority and with the constrictions of limited budgets, it is unlikely that countries that still struggle with the concept will achieve a stable and efficient civil-military relationship, something that will continue to damage state capacity and stability.

According to [[Amitai Etzioni]] of the Institute for Communitarian Policy Studies, the [[AirSea Battle]] doctrine is an example of a situation in which the military conceptualizes and develops a plan to counter a perceived threat to the United States without sufficient civilian oversight.&lt;ref&gt;Etzioni, Amitai. "Who Authorized Preparations for War with China?" Yale Journal of International Affairs, June 2013. [http://yalejournal.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/YJIA-SUMMER-VOL8-ISSUE2-FINAL-A5-Etzioni-Copy.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil–military relations in Afghanistan==
Researchers from the [[Overseas Development Institute]] wrote that 'the belief that development and reconstruction activities are central to security'...'is a central component of western involvement' and that this has been 'highly contentious among aid agencies, perhaps nowhere more so than [[Afghanistan]].'
Their April 2013 paper &lt;ref&gt;Ashley Jackson and Simone Haysom; April 2013; The search for common ground, Civil–military relations in Afghanistan, 2002–13; HPG Policy Brief 51; http://www.odi.org.uk/publications/7446-stablisation-civil-military-relations-afghanistan&lt;/ref&gt; includes the following three key messages -

* Stabilisation approaches are likely to continue to present challenges to the aid community’s ability to act according to humanitarian principles in conflict-affected, fragile and postconflict environments. Experiences in Afghanistan highlight significant tension, if not conflict, between stabilisation and internationally recognised guidelines and principles governing civil–military interaction.
* Civil–military dialogue was markedly more effective when it was rooted in International Humanitarian Law (IHL) and strategic argumentation, as with advocacy focused on reducing harm to civilians.
* Aid agencies need to invest more in capacity and training for engaging in civil–military dialogue and, together with donors, seek to generate more objective evidence on the impact of stabilisation approaches.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1820">'''Damped Lyman alpha systems''' or '''Damped Lyman alpha absorption systems''' are concentrations of neutral [[hydrogen]] gas, detected in the [[Spectrum|spectra]] of [[quasar]]s. They are defined to be systems where the column density (density projected along the line of sight to the quasar) of hydrogen is larger than 2 x 10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; atoms/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Coles&gt;{{cite book |last1=Coles |first1=Peter |authorlink1=Peter Coles |last2=Lucchin |first2=Francesco |title=Cosmology: The Origin and Evolution of Cosmic Structure |edition=2nd |year=2002 |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |location=England |isbn=0-471-48909-3 |pages=430–432}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Lanzetta |first=Kenneth M |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Astronomy and Astrophysics |title=Lyman Alpha Absorption: The Damped Systems |year=2001 |isbn=0-333-75088-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The observed spectra consist of neutral hydrogen [[Lyman alpha]] absorption lines which are broadened by [[radiation damping]]. These systems can be observed in quantity at relatively high [[redshift]]s of 2-4, when they contained most of the neutral hydrogen in the universe.
They are believed to be associated with the early stages of [[Galaxy formation and evolution|galaxy formation]], as the high neutral hydrogen column densities of DLAs are also typical of sightlines in the [[Milky Way]], and other nearby galaxies. Since they are observed in absorption rather than by their stars, they offer the opportunity to study the dynamics of the gas in early galaxies directly.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9099">The '''density matrix renormalization group (DMRG)''' is a numerical [[Variational method (quantum mechanics)|variational]] technique devised to obtain the [[Macroscopic scale|low-energy physics]] of [[Many-body problem|quantum many-body systems]] with high accuracy. As a [[Variational method (quantum mechanics)|variational method]], DMRG is an efficient algorithm that attempts to find the lowest-energy [[matrix product state]] wavefunction of a Hamiltonian. It was invented in 1992 by [[Steven R. White]] and it is nowadays the most efficient method for 1-dimensional systems.

==The idea behind DMRG==

The main problem of [[Many-body problem|quantum many-body physics]] is the fact that the [[Hilbert space]] grows exponentially with size. For example, a [[spin-1/2]] chain of length&amp;nbsp;''L'' has 2&lt;sup&gt;''L''&lt;/sup&gt; degrees of freedom. The DMRG is an [[iterative]], variational method that reduces effective [[degrees of freedom]] to those most important for a target state. The target state is often the [[ground state]].

After a warmup cycle, the method splits the system into two subsystems, or blocks, which need not have equal sizes, and two sites in between. A set of ''representative states'' has been chosen for the block during the warmup. This set of left block&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;two sites&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;right block is known as the '''superblock'''. Now a candidate for the ground state of the superblock, which is a reduced version of the full system, may be found. It may have a rather poor accuracy, but the method is [[iterative]] and improves with the steps below.

[[Image:Dmrg1.png|thumb|300px|right|Decomposition of the system into left and right blocks, according to DMRG.]]

The candidate ground state that has been found is projected into the [[Linear subspace|Hilbert subspace]] for each block using a [[density matrix]], hence the name. Thus, the ''relevant states'' for each block are updated.

Now one of the blocks grows at the expense of the other and the procedure is repeated. When the growing block reaches maximum size, the other starts to grow in its place. Each time we return to the original (equal sizes) situation, we say that a ''sweep'' has been completed. Normally, a few sweeps are enough to get a precision of a part in&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; for a 1D lattice.

[[Image:Dmrg2.png|thumb|300px|right|The DMRG sweep.]]

The first application of the DMRG, by Steven White and Reinhard Noack, was a ''toy model'': to find the spectrum of a [[Spin (physics)|spin]] 0 particle in a 1D box. This model had been proposed by [[Kenneth G. Wilson]] as a test for any new [[renormalization group]] method, because they all happened to fail with this simple problem. The DMRG overcame the problems of previous [[renormalization group]] methods by connecting two blocks with the two sites in the middle rather than just adding a single site to a block at each step as well as by using the [[density matrix]] to identify the most important states to be kept at the end of each step. After succeeding with the ''toy model'', the DMRG method was tried with success on the [[Heisenberg model (quantum)]].

==Technical details about the implementation==

A practical implementation of the DMRG algorithm is a lengthy work. A few of the main computational tricks are these:

* The ground state for the superblock is obtained using the [[Lanczos algorithm]] of matrix diagonalization.  Another choice is the [[Arnoldi iteration|Arnoldi method]], especially when dealing with non-hermitian matrices.
* The Lanczos algorithm usually starts with a random seed. In DMRG, the ground state obtained in a certain DMRG step, suitably transformed, may serve as a better seed for the Lanczos algorithm at the next DMRG step.
* In systems with symmetries, we may have conserved quantum numbers, such as total spin in a [[Heisenberg model (quantum)]]. It is convenient to find the ground state within each of the sectors into which the Hilbert space is divided.
*An example: [[dmrg of Heisenberg model]]

==Applications==

{{See also|DMRG of the Heisenberg model}}

The DMRG has been successfully applied to get the low energy properties of spin chains: [[Ising model]] in a transverse field, [[Heisenberg model (quantum)|Heisenberg model]], etc., fermionic systems, such as the [[Hubbard model]], problems with impurities such as the [[Kondo effect]], [[boson]] systems, and the physics of [[quantum dots]] joined with [[quantum wire]]s. It has been also extended to work on [[tree graph]]s, and has found applications in the study of [[dendrimers]]. For 2D systems with one of the dimensions much larger than the other DMRG is also accurate, and has proved useful in the study of ladders.

The method has been extended to study equilibrium [[statistical physics]] in 2D, and to analyze [[nonequilibrium|non-equilibrium]] phenomena in 1D.

The DMRG has also been applied to the field of [[Quantum Chemistry]] to study strongly correlated systems.

==The matrix product ansatz==

The success of the DMRG for 1D systems is related to the fact that it is a variational method within the space of [[matrix product state]]s. These are states of the form

: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{s_1\cdots s_N} \operatorname{Tr}(A^{s_1}\cdots A^{s_N}) | s_1 \cdots s_N\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;s_1\cdots s_N&lt;/math&gt; are the values of the e.g. ''z''-component of the spin in a spin chain, and the ''A''&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; are matrices of arbitrary dimension&amp;nbsp;''m''.  As ''m''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;∞, the representation becomes exact. This theory was exposed by S. Rommer and S. Ostlund in [https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9606213].

==Extensions of DMRG==

In 2004 the [[time-evolving block decimation]] method was developed to implement real time evolution of Matrix Product States. The idea is based on the classical simulation of a [[quantum computer]]. Subsequently, a new method was devised to compute real time evolution within the DMRG formalism - See the paper by A. Feiguin and S.R. White [https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0502475].

In recent years, some proposals to extend the method to 2D and 3D have been put forward, extending the definition of the Matrix Product States. See this paper by F. Verstraete and I. Cirac, [https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0407066].

'''''Doubt is Their Product: How Industry's Assault on Science Threatens Your Health''''' is a 2008 book by [[David Michaels (epidemiologist)|David Michaels]], Assistant Secretary of Labor for [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|Occupational Safety and Health]] under U.S. President [[Barack Obama|Obama]].

"Doubt is our product," Michaels quotes a cigarette executive as saying, "since it is the best means of competing with the 'body of fact' that exists in the minds of the general public. It is also the means of establishing a controversy."  Michaels argues that, for decades, cigarette manufacturers knew that their product was hazardous to people's health, but hired mercenary scientists who "manufactured uncertainty by questioning every study, dissecting every method, and disputing every conclusion".  In doing so the tobacco industry waged a campaign that "successfully delayed regulation and victim compensation for decades"

''Doubt is Their Product'' documents how the [[tobacco industry]]'s tactics spawned a multimillion dollar industry that is dismantling public health safeguards in areas far from tobacco. Product defense consultants, he argues, have increasingly skewed the scientific literature, manufactured and magnified scientific uncertainty, and influenced policy decisions to the advantage of polluters and the manufacturers of dangerous products. To keep the public confused about the hazards posed by [[global warming]], [[second-hand smoke]], [[asbestos]], [[lead]], [[plastics]], and many other toxic materials, industry executives have hired unscrupulous scientists and lobbyists to dispute scientific evidence about health risks. In doing so, they have not only delayed action on specific hazards, but they have constructed barriers to make it harder for lawmakers, government agencies, and courts to respond to future threats.&lt;ref name="dm"&gt;{{cite book |author=Michaels, David |title=Doubt Is Their Product: How Industry's Assault on Science Threatens Your Health |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2008 |pages=3–4 |isbn=0-19-530067-X |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J0P3IdSYO_MC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=0-19-530067-X&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Expectation confirmation theory''' (alternatively '''ECT''' or '''expectation disconfirmation theory''') is a [[Cognitive psychology|cognitive theory]] which seeks to explain post-purchase or post-adoption [[Contentment|satisfaction]] as a function of expectations, perceived performance, and disconfirmation of beliefs. The structure of the theory was developed in a series of two papers written by Richard L. Oliver in 1977&lt;ref&gt;Oliver R. L, 1977, "Effect of Expectation and Disconfirmation on Postexposure Product Evaluations - an Alternative Interpretation," Journal of Applied Psychology, 62(4), p. 480.&lt;/ref&gt; and 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver R. L, 1980, "A Cognitive Model of the Antecedents and Consequences of Satisfaction Decisions," Journal of Marketing Research, 17(4), p. 460.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the theory originally appeared in the [[psychology]] and [[marketing]] literatures, it has since been adopted in several other scientific fields, notably including [[consumer research]] and [[information systems]], among others.

==Theoretical constructs==
Expectation confirmation theory involves four primary constructs: expectations, perceived performance, disconfirmation of beliefs, and satisfaction.

===Expectations===
''Expectations'' refer to the attributes or characteristics that a person anticipates or predicts will be associated with an entity such as a product, service, or technology artifact. Expectations are posited to directly influence both perceptions of performance and disconfirmation of beliefs, and are posited to indirectly influence post-purchase or post-adoption satisfaction by way of a [[Mediation (statistics)|mediational relationship]] through the disconfirmation construct. Pre-purchase or pre-adoption expectations form the basis of comparison against which the product, service, or technology artifact is ultimately judged.

=== Perceived performance===
''Perceived performance'' refers to a person’s perceptions of the actual performance of a product, service, or technology artifact. According to expectation confirmation theory, perceptions of performance are directly influenced by pre-purchase or pre-adoption expectations, and in turn directly influence disconfirmation of beliefs and post-purchase or post-adoption satisfaction. Perceived performance is also posited to indirectly influence post-purchase or post-adoption satisfaction by way of a mediational relationship through the disconfirmation construct.

=== Disconfirmation of beliefs===
''Disconfirmation of beliefs'' refers to the judgments or evaluations that a person makes with respect to a product, service, or technology artifact. These evaluations or judgments are made in comparison to the person’s original expectations. When a product, service, or technology artifact outperforms the person’s original expectations, the disconfirmation is positive, which is posited to increase post-purchase or post-adoption satisfaction. When a product, service, or technology artifact underperforms the person’s original expectations, the disconfirmation is negative, which is posited to decrease post-purchase or post-adoption satisfaction (i.e., to increase dissatisfaction).

===Satisfaction===
Post-purchase or post-adoption ''satisfaction'' refers to the extent to which a person is pleased or contented with a product, service, or technology artifact after having gained direct experience with the product, service, or artifact. Expectation confirmation theory posits that satisfaction is directly influenced by disconfirmation of beliefs and perceived performance, and is indirectly influenced by both expectations and perceived performance by means of a mediational relationship which passes through the disconfirmation construct.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6414">The '''Gibsonian ecological theory of development''' is a theory of development that was created by American psychologist [[Eleanor J. Gibson]] during the 1960s and 1970s. Gibson emphasized the importance of environment and context in learning and, together with husband and fellow psychologist [[James J. Gibson]], argued that perception was crucial as it allowed humans to adapt to their environments. Gibson stated that "children learn to detect information that specifies objects, events, and layouts in the world that they can use for their daily activities".&lt;ref&gt;Miller, P. (2002). Theories of Developmental Psychology (4th ed.). New York, NY: Worth Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, humans learn out of necessity. Children are information "hunter-gatherers",&lt;ref&gt;Miller, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; gathering information in order to survive and navigate in the world.

==Key concepts==
Gibson asserted that development was driven by a complex interaction between environmental [[affordance]]s and the motivated humans who perceive them. For example, to an infant, different surfaces "afford" opportunities for walking, crawling, grasping, etc. As children gain motor skills, they discover new opportunities for movement and thus new affordances.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The more chances they are given to perceive and interact with their environment, the more affordances they discover, and the more accurate their perceptions become.

Gibson identified four important aspects of human behavior that develop:&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, E. J. &amp; Pick, A. D. (2000). An Ecological Approach to Perceptual Learning and Development. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Agency''' - Self-control, intentionality in behavior
**Agency is learning to control both one's own activity and external events
**Babies learn at an early age that their actions have an effect on the environment
**For example: Babies were observed kicking their legs at a mobile hanging above them. They had discovered their kicking made the mobile move.
*'''Prospectivity''' - Intentional, anticipatory, planful, future-oriented behaviors
**For example: A baby will reach out to try and catch an object moving toward them because the baby can anticipate that the object will continue to move close enough to catch. In other words, the baby perceives that reaching out his/her hand will afford him/her to catch the object.
*'''Search for Order''' - Tendency to see order, regularity, and pattern to make sense of the world
**For example: Before 9 months, infants begin to recognize the strong-weak stress patterns in their native language
*'''Flexibility''' - Perception can adjust to new situations and bodily conditions (such as growth, improved motor skills, or a sprained ankle)
**Examples: Three-month-old infants lying under a mobile had a string attached to their right leg and then to the mobile so that when they moved their leg the mobile would move. When the string was switched to the left legs, the infants would easily shift to moving that leg to activate the mobile.
**Perception is an ongoing, active process.

==Methodology==
Gibson used experimental procedures while also attempting to retain ecological validity by simulating important features of the child's natural environment. In keeping with the idea of affordances, Gibson tried to provide multimodal stimulation for infants in these experiments (multiple kinds of objects, faces, or surfaces, for example) and ways of obtaining feedback through movement and exploration.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Gibson's well-known perceptual experiments involved the construction of a "[[visual cliff]]," simulating a real cliff. Gibson and Walk&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, E.J.; Walk, R.D. (April 1960). "Visual Cliff". Scientific American.&lt;/ref&gt; placed infants near the cliff and placed mothers on the other side of the cliff. They found that infants perceived depth and were unwilling to crawl over the cliff at approximately 6–7 months. Later experiments showed that 12-month-old infants had learned to use their mothers' facial expressions as signals of potential affordances. If mothers smiled, infants were more likely to crawl over the "dangerous" cliff, but if mothers made a frightened face, infants avoided the cliff.&lt;ref&gt;Sorce, J. F., Emde, R. N., Campos, J., &amp; Klinnert, M. D. (1985). Maternal emotional signalling: Its effect on the visual cliff behavior of 1-year-olds. Developmental Psychology, 21, 195-200.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Gibson's theory has been criticized for its "unclear account of cognition".&lt;ref&gt;p. 363, Miller, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Gibson's theory pertains to direct perception and does not take into account that behaviors may involve indirect, interpretive cognition. Gibson's methodology involves an expensive and complicated experimental set up, which may prove cost- and time-prohibitive for many researchers. Finally, Gibson's research was almost exclusively confined to infants and very young children, so it is difficult to make generalizations throughout the lifespan.

==Current State of Gibsonian Theory==
Aside from her own writings, Gibson's work is rarely described as a theory of development. When Gibson's primary area of research, affordances, is referenced, the citations typically refer only to James Gibson.&lt;ref&gt;Michaels, C. F. (2003). Affordances: Four points of debate. Ecological Psychology, 15, 135-148.&lt;/ref&gt; Gibson is credited with popularizing affordances in perceptual research. However, unlike Gibson, researchers have studied affordances in all age groups, including adults. Affordances have been applied to a range of innovative topics, from automobile driving&lt;ref&gt;Schwebel, D. C., &amp; Yocom, J. S. (2007). How personality and reward relate to automobile drivers' judgments of affordances using their own vehicles. Ecological Psychology, 19, 49-68.&lt;/ref&gt; to text messaging.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, F. J. M., &amp; Reid, D. J. (2010). The expressive and conversational affordances of mobile messaging. Behaviour and Information Technology, 29, 3-22.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the concept of affordances is usually used in isolation rather than being integrated into Gibson's ecological framework. Some researchers are even attempting to create their own theories of affordances instead of revising Gibson's theory to accommodate new findings.&lt;ref&gt;Chemero, A. (2003). An outline of a theory of affordances. Ecological Psychology, 15, 181-195.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Headhunting''' is the practice of taking and [[Human trophy collecting|preserving a person's head]] after killing the person. Headhunting was practised in historic times in parts of [[Oceania]], [[South Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]], [[West Africa|West]] and [[Central Africa]], [[Mesoamerica]], and [[Europe]]. It occurred in Europe to the end of the Middle Ages in Ireland and the [[Anglo-Scottish border]] regions, and until the 20th century in [[Montenegro]], [[Croatia]], [[Albania]], and western parts of [[Herzegovina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/258121/headhunting |title=headhunting (anthropology) – Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date=2009-02-23 |accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The headhunting practice has been the subject of intense study within the [[anthropology|anthropological community]], where scholars try to assess and interpret its social [[Social role|roles]], [[Social function|functions]], and motivations. Anthropological writings explore themes in headhunting that include [[mortification of the flesh|mortification]] of the rival, [[ritual murder|ritual violence]], [[cosmology|cosmological]] balance, the display of [[manhood]], [[cannibalism]], dominance over the body and soul of his enemies in life and afterlife, as a trophy and proof of killing (achievement in hunting), show of greatness, prestige by taking on a rival's spirit and power, and as a means of securing the services of the victim as a slave in the afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;E-Modigliani, "Un viaggio a Nias," Fratelli Treves Editori Milano 1890&lt;/ref&gt;

Today's scholars generally agree that headhunting's primary function was ritual and ceremonial. It was part of the process of structuring, reinforcing, and defending [[Social hierarchy|hierarchical relationships]] between communities and individuals.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Some experts theorize that the practice stemmed from the belief that the head contained "[[Soul (spirit)|soul]] matter" or life force, which could be harnessed through its capture.&lt;ref&gt;Hutton, J. H. "The Significance of Head-Hunting in Assam." ''The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland'', vol. 58, 1928, pp. 399–408.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the [[Marind-anim]] in New Guinea were famed because of their headhunting.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nev57|Nevermann 1957]]: 9&lt;/ref&gt; The practice was rooted in their belief system and linked to the name-giving of the newborn.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nev57|Nevermann 1957]]: 111&lt;/ref&gt; The skull was believed to contain a [[mana]]-like force.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nev57|Nevermann 1957]]: blurb&lt;/ref&gt; Headhunting was not motivated primarily by cannibalism, but the dead person's flesh was consumed in ceremonies following the capture and killing.&lt;ref name=cannibalism&gt;[[#Nev57|Nevermann 1957]]: 13&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Korowai people|Korowai]], a [[Papuan peoples|Papuan]] tribe in the southeast of [[Irian Jaya]], live in [[tree houses]], some nearly 40 metres high. This is believed to be a defensive practice, presumably as protection against the [[Citak]], a tribe of neighbouring headhunters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1998/03/980309043026.htm |title=Head-Hunters Drove Papuan Tribe Into Tree-Houses |publisher=Sciencedaily.com |date=1998-03-09 |accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers believe that the American [[Michael Rockefeller]], who disappeared in New Guinea in 1961 while on a field trip, may have been taken by headhunters in the [[Asmat Regency|Asmat]] region. He was the son of New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller.

In ''[[The Cruise of the Snark]]'' (1911), the account by [[Jack London]] of his 1905 adventure sailing in Micronesia, he recounted that headhunters of [[Malaita]] attacked his ship during a stay in [[Langa Langa Lagoon]], particularly around [[Laulasi Island]]. His and other ships were kidnapping villagers as workers on plantations, a practice known as [[blackbirding]]. Captain Mackenzie of the ship ''Minolta'' was beheaded by villagers as retribution for the loss of village men during an armed labour "recruiting" drive. The villagers  believed that the ship's crew "owed" several more heads before the score was even.&lt;ref name="wealth"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Cruise of the Snark | work=[[The Cruise of the Snark]] | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3REJt-9gfm8C&amp;printsec=titlepage |pages=|author=[[Jack London]]|year=1911 |publisher=Harvard University Digitized Jan 19, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Southeast Asia ===

In Southeast Asia, anthropological writings have explored headhunting and other practises of the [[Murut people|Murut]], [[Ilongot people|Ilongot]], [[Igorot]], [[Iban people|Iban]], [[Dayak people|Dayak]], Berawan, Wana, and Mappurondo tribes. Among these groups, headhunting was usually a ritual activity rather than an act of war or feuding. A warrior would take a single head. Headhunting acted as a catalyst for the cessation of personal and collective [[mourning]] for the community's dead. Ideas of manhood and marriage were encompassed in the practice, and the taken heads were highly prized. Other reasons for headhunting included capture of enemies as slaves, looting of valuable properties, intra and inter-ethnic conflicts, and territorial expansion.

Italian anthropologist and explorer [[Elio Modigliani]] visited the headhunting communities in South [[Nias]] (an island to the west of Sumatra) in 1886; he wrote a detailed study of their society and beliefs. He found that the main purpose of headhunting was the belief that, if a man owned another person's skull, his victim would serve as a slave of the owner for eternity in the afterlife. Human skulls were a valuable commodity.&lt;ref&gt;E.Modigliani, "Un viaggio a Nias", Fratelli Treves Editori Milano 1890&lt;/ref&gt; Sporadic headhunting continued in Nias island until the late 20th century, the last reported incident dating from 1998.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Headhunting was practised among [[Sumba people]] until the early 20th century. It was done only in large war parties. When the men hunted wild animals, by contrast, they operated in silence and secrecy.&lt;ref&gt;Hoskins, Janet. ''The Play of Time: Kodi Perspectives on Calendars, History, and Exchange.'' Berkeley:  University of California Press,  c1993 1993. http://ark.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/ft0x0n99tc/ p.312-314&lt;/ref&gt; The skulls collected were hung on the skull tree erected in the center of village. As recently as 1998, in [[Waikabubak]], a major clash of clans resulted in some people being decapitated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insideindonesia.org/edition-58-apr-jun-1999/tragedy-in-sumba-2209694 |title=Tragedy in Sumba |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322175551/http://www.insideindonesia.org/edition-58-apr-jun-1999/tragedy-in-sumba-2209694 |archivedate=March 22, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}. insideindonesia.org&lt;/ref&gt; This was reminiscent of the headhunting tradition.

Kenneth George wrote about annual headhunting rituals that he observed among the Mappurondo religious minority, an upland [[tribe]] in the southwest part of the Indonesian island of [[Sulawesi]]. Heads are not taken; instead, surrogate heads in the form of coconuts are used in a ritual ceremony. The ritual, called ''pangngae,'' takes place at the conclusion of the rice-harvesting season. It functions to bring an end to communal [[mourning]] for the deceased of the past year; express intercultural tensions and polemics; allow for a display of manhood; distribute communal resources; and resist outside pressures to abandon Mappurondo ways of life.

United States authorities in the Philippines suppressed headhunting among the [[Ilongot people|Ilongot]] in the 1930s. The [[Igorot people|Igorot]] in the [[Philippines]] also practiced headhunting.

The [[Va people|Wa]] tribe, whose domain straddles the Burma-China border, were once known to Europeans as the "Wild Wa" for their "savage" behavior. Until the 1970s, the Wa practiced headhunting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/asia/covers/1101021216/story.html "Soldiers of Fortune"], TIME Asia&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Sarawak]], the north-western region of the island of [[Borneo]], [[James Brooke]] and his descendants established a colonial dynasty. They eradicated headhunting in the hundred years before World War II. Before Brooke's arrival, the Iban had migrated from the middle Kapuas region into the upper Batang Lupar river region by fighting and displacing the small existing tribes, such as the Seru and Bukitan. Another successful migration by the Iban was from the Saribas region into the Kanowit area in the middle of the Batang Rajang river, led by the famous Mujah, Buah Raya. They fought and displaced such tribes as the Kanowit and Baketan.

Brooke first encountered the headhunting Iban of the Saribas-Skrang in Sarawak at the Battle of Betting Maru in 1849. He gained the signing of the Saribas Treaty with the Iban chief of that region, who was named Orang Kaya Pemancha Dana "Bayang". Subsequently, the Brooke dynasty expanded their territory from the first small Sarawak region to the present-day state of Sarawak. They enlisted the Malay, Iban, and other natives as a large but unpaid force to crush and pacify any rebellions in the states. The Brooke government prohibited headhunting  (''ngayau'' in Iban language) and added penalties for disobeying the Rajah-led government decree. During expeditions sanctioned by the Brooke government, they allowed headhunting. The natives who participated in Brooke-approved punitive expeditions were exempted from paying annual tax to the Brooke government and/or given new territories in return for their service. There were intra-tribal and intertribal headhunting.

The most famous Iban warrior to resist the colonial Brooke government was Libau "Rentap". The Brooke government had to send three punitive expeditions in order to defeat Rentapi at his fortress on the top of Sadok Hill.

The Iban conducted a third major migration, from upper Batang Ai region in the Batang Lupar region into Katibas and onward to Baleh/Mujong region in the upper Batang Rajang region. They displaced the existing tribes of the Kayan, Kajang, Ukit, etc. The Brooke government sanctioned the last migrations of the Iban, and reduced fighting to a minimum. The Iban conducted sacred ritual ceremonies with special and complex incantations to invoke god's blessings, which were associated with headhunting. An example was the Bird Festival in the Saribas/Skrang region and Proper Festival in the Baleh region, both required for men of the tribes to become effective warriors.

During the Japanese occupation during the Second World War, headhunting was revived among the natives. The Sukarno-led Indonesian forces fought against the formation of the Federation of Malaysia. Forces of Malaya, Singapore, Sabah and Sarawak fought in addition, and headhunting was observed during the communist insurgency in Sarawak and what was then Malaya. The Iban were noted for headhunting, and were later recognised as good rangers and trackers during military operations, during which they were awarded fourteen medals of valour and honour.

Since 1997 serious inter-ethnic violence has erupted on the island of Kalimantan, involving the indigenous [[Dayak people]]s and immigrants from the island of [[Madura]]. Events have included the [[Sambas riots]] and [[Sampit conflict]]. In 2001 during the [[Sampit conflict]] in the Central [[Kalimantan]] town of [[Sampit]], at least 500 [[Madurese people|Madurese]] were killed and up to 100,000 Madurese were forced to flee. Some Madurese bodies were decapitated in a ritual reminiscent of the Dayak headhunting tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/security/natres/timber/2001/0301brno.htm |title=Behind Ethnic War, Indonesia's Old Migration Policy |publisher=Globalpolicy.org |date=2001-03-01 |accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ambonese]], a tribe of mixed Malay-Papuan origin living in the [[Moluccas]], were fierce headhunters until the Dutch colonial rule in Indonesia suppressed the practice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nunusaku.com/pdfs/politicians_magicans.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

In what is now known as New Zealand, the [[Māori people|Māori]] preserved the heads of enemies in a form known as ''[[mokomokai]].'' They removed the brain and eyes, and smoked the head. The heads were sold to European collectors in the late 1800s, in some instances having been commissioned and 'made to order.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/weather-delays-return-toi-moko-4703230 "Weather delays return of toi-moko"], TNVZ (national news)&lt;/ref&gt;  Currently the Māori are attempting to reclaim the heads of their own ancestors held in museums outside New Zealand. Twenty heads were returned to them by French authorities in January 2012, repatriated from museums.

===China===
During the [[Spring and Autumn period]] and [[Warring States period]]&lt;!-- give dates --&gt;, [[Qin (state)|Qin]] soldiers frequently collected their enemies' heads. Most of the soldiers were conscripted [[serfs]] and were not paid. Instead, the soldiers earned promotions and rewards from superiors by collecting the heads of enemies, a type of [[body count]]. In this area, authorities displayed heads of executed criminals in public spaces up to the 20th century.

&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Samurai]] also sought glory by headhunting. When a battle ended, the warrior, true to his mercenary origins, would ceremoniously present trophy heads to a general, who would variously reward him with promotions in rank, gold or silver, or land from the defeated clan. Generals displayed the heads of defeated rivals in public squares.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/features/world/asia/japan/samurai-text/1 Tom O'Neill, "Samurai: Japan's Way of the Warrior"], ''National Geographic Magazine.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Headhunting was a common practice among [[Taiwanese aborigines]]. All tribes practised headhunting except the [[Yami people]], who were previously isolated on [[Orchid Island]], and the [[Ivatan people]]. It was associated with the peoples of the Philippines.

[[Taiwanese Plains Aborigines]], [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese people (Han)]] and [[Yamato people|Japanese]] settlers were choice victims of headhunting raids by Taiwanese Mountain Aborigines. The latter two groups were considered invaders, liars, and enemies. A headhunting raid would often strike at workers in the fields or set a dwelling on fire, and then kill and behead those who fled from the burning structure. The practice continued during the [[Japanese occupation of Taiwan]], but ended in the 1930s due to suppression by the colonial Japanese government.

[[File:Taiwan aborigines headhunting 06.jpg|thumb|The headhunting ritual of aborigines in Taiwan]]
The [[Taiwanese Aboriginal]] tribes, who were allied with the Dutch against the Chinese during the [[Guo Huaiyi Rebellion]] in 1652, turned against the Dutch in turn during the [[Siege of Fort Zeelandia]].

At the [[Battle of Tamsui]] in the [[Keelung Campaign]] during the [[Sino-French War]] on 8 October 1884, the Chinese took prisoners and beheaded 11 French marines who were injured, in addition to ''La Gailissonniere's'' captain Fontaine. The heads were mounted on bamboo poles and displayed to incite anti-French feelings. In China pictures of the beheading of the Frenchmen were published in the ''Tien-shih-tsai Pictorial Journal'' in Shanghai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hlnKRaZ0f4QC&amp;pg=PA99&amp;dq=French+severed+heads+bamboo+poles+Tamsui&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QjJJVJ_LJ5Gj8gGI4ICgAQ&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=French%20severed%20heads%20bamboo%20poles%20Tamsui&amp;f=false|title=Maritime Taiwan|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|A most unmistakable scene in the market place occurred. Some six heads of Frenchmen, heads of the true French type were exhibited, much to the disgust of foreigners. A few visited the place where they were stuck up, and were glad to leave it—not only on account of the disgusting and barbarous character of the scene, but because the surrounding crowd showed signs of turbulence. At the camp also were eight other Frenchmen's heads, a sight which might have satisfied a savage or a Hill-man, but hardly consistent with the comparatively enlightened tastes, one would think, of Chinese soldiers even of to-day. It is not known how many of the French were killed and wounded; fourteen left their bodies on shore, and no doubt several wounded were taken back to the ships. (Chinese accounts state that twenty were killed and large numbers wounded.)

In the evening Captain Boteler and Consul Frater called on General Sun, remonstrating with him on the subject of cutting heads off, and allowing them to be exhibited. Consul Frater wrote him a despatch on the subject strongly deprecating such practices, and we understand that the general promised it should not occur again, and orders were at once given to bury the heads. It is difficult for a general even situated as Sun is—having to command troops like the Hillmen, who are the veriest savages in the treatment of their enemies—to prevent such barbarities.

It is said the Chinese buried the dead bodies of the Frenchmen after the engagement on 8th instant by order of General Sun.

[[File:Objets dAmazonie (réserves visitables du musée national dethnologie) (1450150520).jpg|thumb|[[Shrunken head]] from the upper Amazon region]]
Several tribes of the [[Jivaroan]] group, including the [[Shuar people|Shuar]] in Eastern Ecuador and Northern Peru, along the rivers [[Chinchipe river|Chinchipe]], [[Bobonaza River|Bobonaza]], [[Morona]], [[Upano River|Upano]], and [[Pastaza River|Pastaza]], main tributaries of the [[Amazon River|Amazon]], practised headhunting for trophies. The heads were [[shrunken head|shrunk]], and were known locally as ''Tzan-Tzas''. The people believed that the head housed the soul of the person killed.

In the 21st century, the Shuar produce Tzan-tza replicas. They use their traditional process on heads of [[Silvery woolly monkey|monkeys]] and [[sloths]], selling the items to tourists. It is believed that splinter groups in the local tribes continue with these practises when there is a tribal feud over territory or as revenge for a crime of passion. {{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The [[Quechua people|Quechua]] Lamista in Peru used to be headhunters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wb45ohGLvpEC&amp;pg=PA163&amp;lpg=PA163&amp;dq=quechua++head+hunting&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ETKl3YXSXI&amp;sig=dDPtC_RJK2fXg7mFhIyjEyXNHFg&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Tw_HUdyHB8GZtAalqoH4Dg&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=quechua%20%20head%20hunting&amp;f=false|title=Plants, Health And Healing|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tzompantli Tovar.jpeg|thumb|250px|A ''tzompantli'' is illustrated to the right of a depiction of an [[Aztec]] temple dedicated to the deity [[Huitzilopochtli]]; from Juan de Tovar's 1587 manuscript, also known as the [[Ramírez Codex]].]]
A ''[[tzompantli]]'' is a type of wooden rack or palisade documented in several [[Mesoamerica]]n civilizations. It was used for the public display of [[human skull]]s, typically those of war captives or other [[human sacrifice|sacrificial victims]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mexico-archaeology-skulls-idUSKBN19M3Q6 Tower of human skulls in Mexico casts new light on Aztecs]". Reuters. July 1, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

A tzompantli-type structure has been excavated at the [[La Coyotera]], [[Oaxaca]], site. It is dated to the Proto-Classic [[Zapotec civilization]], which flourished from c. 2nd century BCE to the 3rd century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer (1982), pp. 236–239&lt;/ref&gt; ''Tzompantli'' are also noted in other Mesoamerican [[pre-Columbian]] cultures, such as the [[Toltec]] and [[Mixtec]].

Based on numbers given by the [[conquistador]] [[Andrés de Tapia]] and Fray [[Diego Durán]], Bernard Ortiz de Montellano&lt;ref&gt;Ortíz de Montellano 1983&lt;/ref&gt; has calculated in the late 20th century that there were at most 60,000 skulls on the ''Hueyi Tzompantli'' (great Skullrack) of [[Tenochtitlan]]. There were at least five more skullracks in Tenochtitlan, but, by all accounts, they were much smaller.

Other examples are indicated from [[Maya civilization]] sites. A particularly fine and intact inscription example survives at the extensive [[Chichen Itza]] site.&lt;ref&gt;Miller and Taube (1993), p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Europe==

===Celts===
{{see also|Celtic decapitation}}
The [[Celts]] of Europe practised headhunting as the head was believed to house a person's soul. Ancient [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] and [[ancient Greece|Greeks]] recorded the Celts' habits of nailing heads of personal enemies to walls or dangling them from the necks of horses.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. [[Diodorus Siculus]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=agd-eLVNRMMC&amp;printsec=titlepage#PPA315,M1 5.2]&lt;/ref&gt;  Headhunting was still practised for a great deal longer by the Celtic [[Gaels]]. In the ''[[Ulster Cycle]],'' [[Cúchulainn]] is described as beheading the three sons of Nechtan and mounting their heads on his chariot. This is believed to have been a traditional warrior, rather than religious, practice. The practice continued approximately to the end of the [[Middle Ages]] in Ireland and the Anglo-Scottish marches.&lt;ref name=Headhunt&gt;[http://www.lard.net/headhunters.html "Headhunters", ''Encyclopædia Britannica,'' 1996]&lt;/ref&gt; The religious reasons for collecting heads were likely lost after the Celts' conversion to Christianity.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018|reason=Saying the Celts stopped headhunting once they converted to Christianity is a bold claim.  Especially when the previous sentence says that headhunting was for cultural, not religious, reasons.}} Heads were also taken among the [[Germanic tribes]] and among [[Iberians]], but the purpose is unknown.

===Scythians===
The [[Scythians]] were excellent horsemen. Ancient Greek historian [[Herodotus]] wrote that some of their tribes practised human sacrifice, drinking the blood of victims, [[scalping]] their enemies, and drinking wine from the enemies' skulls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jona Lendering |url=http://www.livius.org/he-hg/herodotus/logos4_10.html |title=Summary of and commentary on Herodotus' Histories, book 4 |publisher=Livius.org |date= |accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Montenegrins===
The [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrins]] are an ethnic group in Southeastern Europe who are centered around the [[Dinaric Mountains|Dinaric mountains]]. They practiced headhunting until 1876, allegedly carrying the head from a lock of hair grown specifically for that purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8KCZhBWVkgMC&amp;pg=PA133&amp;lpg=PA133&amp;dq=montenegrin+headhunting&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OmY8wE7VYx&amp;sig=qG1x69JYkHZLpPkbp8iVc94q3Hk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Y_ThUsGxJsnyoASVsoDQBw&amp;ved=0CFkQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=montenegrin%20headhunting&amp;f=false|title=Albania and the Albanians|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 1830s, Montenegrin ruler [[Petar II Petrović-Njegoš]] started building a tower called ''"Tablja"'' above [[Cetinje Monastery]]. The tower was never finished, and Montenegrins used it to display Turkish heads taken in battle, as they were in frequent conflict with the Ottoman Empire. In 1876 King [[Nicholas I of Montenegro]] ordered that the practise should end. He knew that European diplomats considered it to be barbaric. The ''Tablja'' was demolished in 1937.

===Ottoman Turks===
[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] are alleged to have taken heads of the Montenegrins, when they came into conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=1166608|title=Head-hunting in Europe: Montenegrin heroes, Turkish barbarians and Western observers = Chasse aux têtes en Europe : Héros monténégrins, barbares turcs et observateurs occidentaux|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War II, [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] (specifically including American) troops occasionally collected the skulls of dead Japanese as personal trophies, as souvenirs for friends and family at home, and for sale to others. (The practice was unique to the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific theater]]; United States forces did not take skulls of German and Italian soldiers.)  In September 1942, the Commander in Chief of the Pacific Fleet mandated strong disciplinary action against any soldier who took enemy body parts as souvenirs. But such trophy-hunting persisted: ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' published a photograph in its issue of May 22, 1944, of a young woman posing with the autographed skull sent to her by her Navy boyfriend. There was public outrage in the US in response.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fus90|Fussel 1990]]: 117&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Har06|Harrison 2006]]: 817ff&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians{{who|date=February 2018}} have suggested that the practice related to Americans viewing the Japanese as [[American mutilation of Japanese war dead#Dehumanization|lesser people]] and in response to mutilation and torture of American dead.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wei92|Weingartner 1992]]: 67&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Borneo]], retaliation by natives against the Japanese was based on atrocities having been committed by the Japanese Army in that area. Following their ill treatment by the Japanese, the [[Dayak people|Dayak]] of Borneo formed a force to help the Allies. Australian and British special operatives of [[Z Special Unit]] developed some of the inland Dayak tribesmen into a thousand-man headhunting army. This army of tribesmen killed or captured some 1,500 Japanese soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/11/09/opinion/edheiman.php "'Guests' can succeed where occupiers fail"], ''International Herald Tribune,'' 9 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jakob Benjamin Fischer''' (13 October 1731&amp;ndash;25 July 1793) was a [[Baltic Germans|Baltic German]] naturalist and [[apothecary]].

==Life and work==
Jakob Benjamin Fischer was born in [[Riga]] and studied to become an apothecary there. Between 1756 and 1758, he studied natural sciences, [[physics]] and [[chemistry]] in [[Copenhagen]] and in 1761 he went to [[Uppsala]] and studied [[botany]] and [[zoology]] under [[Carl von Linné]]. He then moved back to Riga and run a [[pharmacy]] in the city. He also engaged in studies of the natural environment of present-day Latvia, and produced several works on the nature of Latvia in which he also referred to the native [[Latvian language|Latvian]] names of plants and animals. The most important of his works, ''Versuch einer Naturgeschichte von Liefland'', is one the earliest descriptions of the nature of [[Livonia]].&lt;ref name="BBL"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://bbld.de/0000000087764732/query/Jakob-Benjamin/|title= Fischer, Jakob Benjamin|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |language= German|website= Baltisches Biographisches Lexikon digital|publisher= Baltischen Historischen Kommission|accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lv"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://iaptieka.lv/?lapa=alte&amp;id=10|title=

[[File:KO_medal01.jpg|thumb|right|Picture of the golden Kamerlingh Onnes medal.]]
The '''Kamerlingh Onnes Award''' is in recognition of special merits of scientists active in the field of [[refrigeration]] technology, [[cryogenics]] and more generally low-temperature science and technology. It was founded in 1948 by the Royal Dutch Association of Refrigeration (Koninklijke Nederlandse Vereniging voor Koude, KNVvK)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knvvk.nl|title=Koninklijke Nederlandse Vereniging voor Koude - KNVvK - Koninklijke Nederlandse Vereniging voor Koude|website=Knvvk.nl|accessdate=29 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the award is intended to keep the memory of [[Heike Kamerlingh Onnes]] alive. The award is assigned typically every four years and the winners get a golden medal and a certificate.

=== Gironde ===

* [[Portets]] - '''Gardens of the Château de Mongénan'''. The château was built in 1736 and the botanical gardens created in 1741 by the Baron de Gasq, inspired by his friend and music teacher [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and the theories of the botanist [[Linnaeus]], who believed that all plants were valuable, whether they were ornamental, medicinal, wild, or for food. The garden was made to resemble the ideal pre-romantic garden Rousseau described in ''La Nouvelle Héloïse'', full of aromas and colors. The current garden is kept as it was in the 18th century, with vegetables of the era, local varieties of fruit trees, 18th century varieties of roses, [[asters]], [[Iris (plant)|irises]], [[dahlia]]s, aromatic plants, and plants used to make [[perfume]]. The [[tuberose]]s and [[jasmine]] fill the gardens with their aromas.
* [[Preignac]] - '''Gardens of the Château de Malle'''.  These gardens, adjoining a château famous for its [[Sauternes (wine)|sauterne]] wines, were designed between 1717 and 1724 by Alexandre Eutrope de Lur Saluces, and are considered among the finest gardens of the French classical age.  They were inspired by the gardens that he saw in [[Florence]] during his grand tour of Italy and his time spent at the court in [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]].  The park has a wide central axis and two terraces, with groups of statues and vases.  The statues were done by Italian artists brought there for that purpose in the early part of the 18th century, and represent figures from [[Greek mythology]]: [[Cephalus]], [[Aurora (mythology)|Aurora]], [[Cupid]], [[Aphrodite]] ([[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]), [[Adonis]], and [[Flora]], the goddess of flowers and gardens. Other statues represent wine-making, the joys of the hunt and fishing, wine and intoxication. To the east of the first terrace is a small theatre, decorated with figures from the Italian [[commedia dell'arte]]: [[Pantalone]], [[Scaramuccia|Scaramouche]] and [[Harlequin]].  A stairway leads to a second terrace decorated with statues symbolising of earth, wind, air and fire.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Racine, ''Jardins en France'', pg. 42&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.parcsetjardins.fr/aquitaine/gironde/jardins_du_ch_teau_de_malle-695.html (see photos)]
* [[Vayres, Gironde|Vayres]] - '''Gardens of the Château de Vayres.'''  The château was built on a mound on the edge of the Dordogne River in the 15th century, then rebuilt in the Renaissance when it was given by King [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] to the Gourgues family. It was rebuilt one more time at the end of the 17th century. The gardens were rebuilt in 1938 by the landscape architect Ferdinand Duprat.  A monumental stairway leads from the château across the old moat to the French gardens by the river, where there are [[parterres]]  bordered with hedges of [[Taxus|yew]], and [[Buxus|boxwood]] trees clipped into cone shapes. There is also a flower garden of medieval inspiration, and an English-style park, with cedar, [[oak]], [[Tilia|linden]], [[hornbeam]] and [[European Beech#Uses|copper beech]] trees.

=== Allier ===
* [[Villeneuve-sur-Allier]] - The '''[[Arboretum de Balaine]]''' is the oldest private botanical garden in France. It was begun in 1804, but largely was the creation of Aglaé Adanson, the daughter of French naturalist [[Michel Adanson]], who was responsible for the [[Petit Trianon]] botanical garden of [[Louis XV]].  She settled there in 1812, at the age of thirty, and established it as one of the earliest acclimatization gardens in France, designed to accustom exotic plants from France's colonies to the climate of France. Despite the blockade of [[Napoleon]]'s Europe by the British fleet, Adanson was able to assemble a remarkable collection of plants from around the world.

The following is a list of [[SIMILE]] projects.

The SIMILE tools assist in the storage, querying, transformation and mapping of very large collections of [[RDF data]]. The tools developed within SIMILE are meant to allow people who are not [[Semantic Web]] developers to create [[Ontology (information science)|ontologies]] which describe their specialized metadata, create RDF and convert other types of metadata into RDF. These open source tools are designed to be scalable and provide for cross-community sharing of metadata at low cost.

==Longwell==


Longwell is a [[faceted browser]] which enables the user to visualize and browse any RDF data set, allowing the user to quickly build a user-friendly web site out of the RDF data without requiring the user to write any RDF code. [[Faceted classification|Facets]] are metadata fields considered important for a given data set. In its default configuration, the collection of facets is returned along the right-hand side of the page, and clicking on any facet causes the refinement of facets in relation to the data retrieved. Longwell then displays only the subset of the data which meet those restrictions. This appears on the left-hand side of the page. Previously selected restrictions can be removed, which causes a broadening of the subset of items displayed.

==Piggy Bank==


Piggy Bank is a [[Firefox]] extension which enables the user to collect information from the Web, save it for future use, tag it with keywords, search and browse information collected, retrieve saved information, share collected information and install [[screen scraping|screen scrapers]]. Piggy Bank gathers RDF data where it is available, and where it is not available, it generates it from [[HTML]] by using screen scrapers. This incremental approach to the realization of the Semantic Web vision allows the user to save and tag information gathered from web pages without having to cut, paste and label the various products of their browsing. By clicking on the keyword they have used to tag particular types of item, the user can view all of those items together within her browser, without having to open other applications. Users can also deposit saved data in the Semantic Bank, where other users can browse it and add their own contributions. This pooling of keywords underlies services such as [[Flickr]] and [[del.icio.us]], where communities can collaborate to build a [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] for shared data. These taxonomies, which emerge as information is accumulated, are known as [[folksonomy|folksonomies]].

==Solvent==


Solvent is a Firefox extension that enables the user to write screen scrapers for Piggy Bank.

==Gadget==


Gadget is an [[XML]] inspector which enables the user to condense large amounts of well-formed XML data.

==Welkin==


[http://simile.mit.edu/welkin/ Welkin] is a graph-based RDF visualizer. It graphs RDF data sets, allowing the user to visualize the global shape and clustering characteristics of the data, which can aid them in mentally modeling it, seeing how it connects and identifying mappings between the set and possible ontologies. A particular data cluster which stands out when graphed might well be missed when browsed at closer range.

==Fresnel==


[https://web.archive.org/web/20080808120019/http://simile.mit.edu/fresnel/ Fresnel] is a vocabulary for specifying how RDF graphs are presented. Fresnel addresses the problem that currently, each RDF browser and visualization tool decides, on an ad hoc basis, what information in an RDF graph is presented and how to present it. Fresnel uses the concepts of lenses and formats. Lenses determine which properties are displayed and how they are ordered. Formats control how resources and properties are presented.

==Timeline==


[[SIMILE Timeline|Timeline]] is a tool for visualizing events over time. It can be populated by pointing it at an XML file

==Exhibit==


[[Exhibit (web editing tool)|Exhibit]] is technology that enables developers to provide browsing of [[faceted classification]]s in a web browser.

==Referee==


Referee is a program that crawls the links that point to its user's pages. It extracts metadata from those pages and the text around the links that pointed to its user's pages, converting it, if need be, into RDF format. Referee discriminates between the pages that refer to the user's pages and the comments, meaning the text immediately surrounding the link. It generates a data graph, allowing it to display the fact that, for example, exactly the same comment in relation to its user's pages appears on more than one page, which is the container of the comment. A page can have more than one comment, and a comment can appear on more than one page. This can be illustrated in a data graph, but would not be possible with a data tree, such as is generated by the XML data model.

==RDFizer==


The RDFizer project is a directory of tools for converting various data formats into RDF. MIT Libraries provides a home for some of these tools. RDFizers are a group of tools that allows the transformation of existing data into an RDF representation. Given a database of interest, these tools can often - when the data formats are highly structured -convert the data into an RDF representation without human intervention, first determining what ontology to use to express the information. Where semantic relationships are implicit, the RDFizers will not be as successful without human input. 
The SIMILE project has built RDFizers that convert from the following formats: 
* [[JPEG]] ''Joint Photographic Experts Group (Digital Photo-METADATA).''
* [[MARC standards|MARC]] ''United States Library of Congress '''MA'''chine-'''R'''eadable '''C'''ataloging of bibliographic data.''
* [[Metadata Object Description Schema|MODS]] ''Metadata Object Description Schema for bibliographic element sets.''
* [[OAI-PMH]] ''Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting.''
* [[OpenCourseWare|OCW]] ''Open Course Ware''
* [[EMail]]
* [[BibTeX]] ''a tool for formatting lists of references usually associated with LaTex documents.''
* Flat
* Weather
* [[Java (programming language)|Java]] ''is an object-oriented applications programming language ''
* [[Javadoc]] ''tool for generating API documentation into HTML format from Java source code.''
* [[Subversion (software)|Subversion]] ''or SVN is a software revision control system.''
* Random

== Crowbar ==


Crowbar is a [[web scraping]] environment based on the use of a [[server-side]] headless Mozilla-based browser. It is used as a research prototype to investigate how to enable the running of Piggy Bank [[Javascript]] scrapers from the command line and thus automate web site scraping.

{{Compact ToC|custom1=Similar cases|seealso=yes|refs=yes}}

==A==
*[[Aharonov–Bohm effect]]. Werner Ehrenberg and [[R. E. Siday|Raymond E. Siday]] first predicted the effect in 1949, and similar effects were later rediscovered by [[Yakir Aharonov]] and [[David Bohm]] in 1959.
*[[Arrhenius equation]]. The equation was first proposed by the Dutch chemist [[Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff|J. H. van 't Hoff]] in 1884; five years later in 1889, the Swedish chemist [[Svante Arrhenius]] provided a physical justification and interpretation for it.
*[[Auger effect]]. First discovered by [[Lise Meitner]] in 1922 and then, independently, in 1923 by [[Pierre Victor Auger]].
*[[Avogadro constant]]. While the work of [[Amedeo Avogadro]] predicted the idea of a set number of molecules in a set weight of a substance, the actual constant was discovered by [[Jean Baptiste Perrin]] some 53 years after Avogadro's death.

==B==

''Proc. 1971 ACM SIGFIDET Workshop on Data Description, Access, and Control'', San Diego, California (November 11–12, 1971).&lt;/ref&gt; Date writes: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Since that definition predated Boyce and Codd's own definition by some three years, it seems to me that BCNF ought by rights to be called ''Heath'' normal form. But it isn't."&lt;ref name="Date"&gt;Date, C.J. ''Database in Depth: Relational Theory for Practitioners''. O'Reilly (2005), p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Z==
*[[Zipf's law]] states that given some [[text corpus|corpus]] of [[natural language]] utterances, the frequency of any word is [[inversely proportional]] to its rank in the frequency table. The law is named after [[George Kingsley Zipf]], an early twentieth century American [[linguist]]. Zipf popularized Zipf's law and sought to explain it, though he did not claim to have originated it.&lt;ref name=Powers1998&gt;{{cite journal |last=Powers |first=David M W |url=http://aclweb.org/anthology/W98-1218 |title=Applications and explanations of Zipf's law |year=1998 |conference=Joint conference on new methods in language processing and computational natural language learning |pages=151–160 |publisher=Association for Computational Linguistics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Mongolian Natural History Museum''' ({{lang-mn|Байгалийн түүхийн музей}}) is a repository and research institution located in [[Ulaanbaatar]], [[Mongolia]]. The museum was previously known as the Mongolian National Museum or State Central Museum. This change in name has often led to confusion with Ulaanbaatar's other preeminent museum, the [[National Museum of Mongolia]]. Although the two museums are located quite close to one another, they contain very different exhibits. The Mongolian National Museum focuses on the archaeology and history of Mongolia, while the Mongolian Natural History Museum is concerned primarily with the flora, fauna, geology and natural history of the country.

The museum includes Departments of Geology, Geography, Flora and Fauna, Paleontology, and Anthropology encompassing the natural history of [[Mongolia]]. The museum's holdings include more than 6000 specimens, 45% of which are on permanent public display.

The museum is particularly well known for its dinosaur and other paleontological exhibits, among which the most notable are a nearly complete skeleton of a late Cretaceous ''[[Tarbosaurus]]'' tyrannosaurid and broadly contemporaneous nests of  ''[[Protoceratops]]'' eggs.

==History==
[[File:Mongolian Museum.jpg|thumb|Mounted ''Tarbosaurus'' exhibit]]
The Museum was established in 1924 as the ''National Museum'' ({{lang-mn|Үндэсний музей}}). In 1940-1941 the museum became known as the ''Rural Research Museum''' ({{lang-mn|Орон нутаг судлах музей}}) and in 1956 as the ''State Central Museum'' ({{lang-mn|Улсын төв музей}}). The museum received its current designation after the [[1990 Mongolian democratic revolution|1991 democratic revolution]].

The current building was erected in 1953, and was deemed to be highly susceptible to natural disasters such as earthquakes in a study made in 2013. It was scheduled to be replaced by a new building, with budgeting planned to start in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.gogo.mn/r/125347&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4524">{{Italic title}}'''''Nomen illegitimum''''' ([[Latin]] for '''illegitimate name''') is a technical term, used mainly in [[botany]]. It is usually abbreviated as '''''nom. illeg.''''' Although  the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]] uses Latin terms for other kinds of name (e.g. ''nomen conservandum'' for "[[conserved name]]"), the glossary defines the English phrase "illegitimate name" rather than the Latin equivalent.&lt;ref name=ICN_Glossary&gt;''Melbourne Code'', [http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php?page=glo Glossary]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Latin abbreviation is widely used by botanists and mycologists.

A '''superfluous name''' is often an illegitimate name. Again, although the glossary defines the English phrase,&lt;ref name=ICN_Glossary/&gt; the Latin equivalent '''''nomen superfluum''''', abbreviated '''''nom. superfl.''''' is widely used by botanists.

==Definition==
A ''nomen illegitimum'' is a [[validly published name (botany)|validly published name]], but one that contravenes some of the articles laid down by the [[International Botanical Congress]].&lt;ref name=ICN&gt;[http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php?page=title Melbourne Code] (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; The name could be illegitimate because:
* (article 52) it was superfluous at its time of publication, i.e., the taxon (as represented by the [[Type (biology)|type]]) already has a name, or 
* (articles 53 and 54) the name has already been applied to another plant (a homonym).

For the procedure of rejecting otherwise legitimate names, see [[conserved name]].

The qualification above concerning the taxon and the type is important. A name can be superfluous but not illegitimate if it would be legitimate for a different [[Circumscription (taxonomy)|circumscription]]. For example, the family name [[Salicaceae]], based on the "type genus" ''[[Salix]]'', was published by [[Charles-François Brisseau de Mirbel ]] in 1815. So when in 1818 [[Lorenz Chrysanth von Vest]] published the name Carpinaceae (based on the genus ''[[Carpinus]]'') for a family explicitly including the genus ''Salix'', it was superfluous: "Salicaceae" was already the correct name for Vest's circumscription; "Carpinaceae" is superfluous for a family containing ''Salix''. However, the name is not illegitimate, since ''Carpinus'' is a legitimate name. If ''Carpinus'' were in future placed in a family where no genus had been used as the basis for a family name earlier than Vest's name (e.g. if it were placed in a family of its own) then Carpinaceae would be its legitimate name. (See Article 52.3, Ex. 18.)

A similar situation can arise when species are synonymized and transferred between genera. [[Carl Linnaeus]] described what he regarded as two distinct species of grass: ''Andropogon fasciculatus'' in 1753 and ''Agrostis radiata'' in 1759. If these two are treated as the same species, the oldest specific epithet, ''fasciculatus'', has priority. So when Swartz in 1788 combined the two as one species in the genus ''Chloris'', the name he used, ''Chloris radiata'', was superfluous, since the correct name already existed, namely ''Chloris fasciculata''. ''Chloris radiata'' is an incorrect name for a species in the genus ''Chloris'' with the same type as Linnaeus's ''Andropogon fasciculatus''. However, if they are treated as separate species, and Linnaeus's ''Agrostis radiata'' is transferred to ''Chloris'', then ''Chloris radiata'' is its legitimate name. (See Article 52.3, Ex. 15.)

==Examples==
* "The generic name ''Cainito'' Adans. (1763) is illegitimate because it was a superfluous name for ''Chrysophyllum'' L. (1753), which Adanson cited as a synonym."&lt;ref name=ICN/&gt;
* "The name ''Amblyanthera'' Müll. Arg. (1860) is a later homonym of the validly published ''Amblyanthera'' Blume (1849) and is therefore unavailable for use, although ''Amblyanthera'' Blume is now considered to be a synonym of ''Osbeckia'' L. (1753)."&lt;ref name=ICN/&gt;
* "The name ''Torreya'' Arn. (1838) is a [[Conserved name|nomen conservandum]] and is therefore available for use in spite of the existence of the earlier homonym ''Torreya'' Raf. (1818)."&lt;ref name=ICN/&gt;

=== Predicted secondary structure ===

PELE (Protein Secondary Structure Prediction) was used to predict the secondary structure of C20orf111. There is little in the way of [[β-strand]] or [[α-helix]] secondary structure, but a large part of the protein appears to exist as random coils. This is shown on the image of the C20orf111 images to the right.

'''Oregonite''', [[nickel|Ni]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[[iron|Fe]][[arsenic|As]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[nickel]] [[iron]] [[arsenide mineral]] first described from Josephine Creek, [[Oregon]], [[US]].

Oregonite crystallises in the [[hexagonal crystal system]] and has a [[Mohs hardness]] of 5. 

==Occurrence==
Oregonite is known, apart from its type locality, from the Chirnaisky Massif, [[Russian Federation|Russia]], associated with hydrothermal nickel minerals ([[millerite]], [[heazelwoodite]]) in a metamorphosed ultramafic; from the Skouriatissa mine, [[Cyprus]], associated with [[Volcanogenic massive sulfide ore deposit|VMS]] mineralisation; and from the [[Kidd Mine]], [[Timmins, Ontario]], [[Canada]] within [[serpentinite]]-hosted [[chromite]] deposits.

An '''overlay journal''' or '''overlay ejournal''' is an [[Open access journal|open access]] [[academic journal]], almost always an online [[electronic journal]] (ejournal), that does not produce its own content, but selects from texts that are already freely available online.  While many overlay journals derive their content from [[preprint]] servers, others, such as the ''Lund Medical Faculty Monthly'', contain mainly papers published by commercial publishers, but with links to self-archived preprint or [[postprint]]s when possible.

The editors of an overlay journal locate suitable material from open access repositories and [[public domain]] sources, read it, and evaluate its worth.  This evaluation may take the form of the judgement of a single editor or editors, or a full [[peer review]] process.

Public validation of subsequently approved texts may take several forms. At its most formal, the editor may republish the article with explicit approval.  Approval might take the form of an addition to the text or its [[metadata]]. Or the editor may simply link to the article, via the [[table of contents]] of the overlay journal. An alternative approach is to link to articles already published in various open access ejournals, but adding value by grouping scattered articles together as a single themed issue of the overlay journal. Such themed issues allow the focussed coverage of relatively obscure or newly emerging topics.

Episciences.org https://www.episciences.org is an inititive to host overlay journals.

The term 'overlay journal' was first coined by Paul Ginsparg in 1996.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=Josh|title=An introduction to overlay journals|url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/19081|website=UCL Discovery|accessdate=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, the journal ''[[Physical Review|Physical Review D]]'' began to link to pre-prints that they had accepted, but not yet published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cassella|first1=Maria|last2=Calvi|first2=Licia|title=New journal models and publishing perspectives in the evolving digital environment|journal=IFLA Journal|date=March 2010|volume=36|issue=1|pages=7–15 |doi=10.1177/0340035209359559}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until later that the first overlay journals were founded, including ''[[Journal of High Energy Physics]]'', ''[[Logical Methods in Computer Science]]'' and ''[[Geometry and Topology]]'', all of which were overlays for [[arXiv]].&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;

In February 2016, [[Timothy Gowers]] launched the overlay journal ''[[Discrete Analysis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ball|first1=Philip|title=Leading mathematician launches arXiv 'overlay' journal|journal=Nature|date=15 September 2015|volume=526|issue=7571|pages=146–146|doi=10.1038/nature.2015.18351|bibcode=2015Natur.526..146B}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overlay journal ''Quantum'' was also launched in 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.scholasticahq.com/post/meet-quantum-community-led-arXiv-overlay-journal/|title=Meet Quantum: A Community-led arXiv overlay journal for quantum science|website=blog.scholasticahq.com|access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.physik.fu-berlin.de/en/einrichtungen/ag/ag-eisert/news/QuantumJournal.html|title=Announcing Quantum – the open journal for quantum science|date=2016-07-18|website=www.physik.fu-berlin.de|language=en|access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://physicstoday.scitation.org/do/10.1063/PT.5.2050/full/|title=A new open-access physics journal enters the fold|last=Grant|first=Andrew|date=9 November 2016|work=Physics Today|access-date=29 March 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the first paper accepted in April 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2017-04-25-1/|title=Self-testing in parallel with CHSH|last=McKague|first=Matthew|date=25 April 2017|website=Quantum Journal|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Western European [[political science]], the term '''polyarchy''' {{lang|el-Latn|poly}} "many", ''arkhe'' "rule")&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/polyarchy polyarchy - Definitions from Dictionary.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; was used by [[Robert A. Dahl|Robert Dahl]] to describe a [[form of government]] in which power is invested in multiple people. It takes the form of neither a [[dictatorship]] nor a [[democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Dahl, Polyarchy: participation and opposition, New Haven, Yale University Press, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; This form of government was first implemented in the United States and France and was gradually adopted by many other countries (Dahl, p. 234, 1989). According to Dahl, the fundamental democratic principle is “the continuing responsiveness of the government to the preferences of its citizens, considered as political equals” with unimpaired opportunities (Dahl, 1971).  A polyarchy is a state that has certain procedures that are necessary conditions for following the democratic principle.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060808235611/http://web.mit.edu/polisci/research/cohen/dahl_on_democracy.pdf "Dahl on Democracy and Equal Consideration"], by Joshua Cohen&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Michels2004" /&gt;

In semblance, the word '''polycracy''' describes the same form of government,&lt;ref&gt;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/polycracy&lt;/ref&gt; although from a slightly different premise: a polycracy is a state ruled by more than one person, as opposed to a [[autocracy|monocracy]]. The word is derived from Greek ''poly'' which means "many" and ''kratos'' which means "rule" or "strength."

== Definitions ==
Dahl's original theory of polyarchal democracy is in his 1956 book, ''A Preface to Democratic Theory''. His theory evolved over the decades, and the description in later writings is somewhat different.

=== ''A Preface to Democratic Theory'' ===
In this book, Dahl gives eight conditions, which measure the extent to which majority rule is in effect in an organization. These are (p.&amp;nbsp;84):

*Every member of the organization performs the acts we assume to constitute an expression of preference among the scheduled alternatives, e.g., voting.
*In tabulating these expressions (votes), the weight assigned to each individual is identical.
*The alternative with the greatest number of votes is declared the winning choice.
*Any member who perceives a set of alternatives, at least one of which he regards as preferable to any of the alternatives presently scheduled, can insert his preferred alternative(s) among those scheduled for voting.
*All individuals possess identical information about the alternatives.
*Alternatives (leaders or policies) with the greatest number of votes displace any alternatives (leaders or policies) with fewer votes.
*The orders of elected officials are executed.
*Either all interelection decisions are subordinate or executory to those arrived at during the election stage, i.e., elections are in a sense controlling; or new decisions during the interelection period are governed by the preceding seven conditions, operating, however, under rather different institutional circumstances; or both.

Dahl hypothesized that each of these conditions can be quantified, and suggested using the term polyarchy to describe an organization that scores high on the scales for all the eight conditions.

Also, Dahl viewed polyarchy as a system that manages to supply a high level of inclusiveness and a high level of liberalization to its citizens.

=== ''Democracy and its critics'' ===
In his 1989 book, ''Democracy and its critics'', Dahl gives the following characteristics of a polyarchy (p.&amp;nbsp;233):

*Control over governmental decisions about policy is constitutionally vested in elected officials.
*Elected officials are chosen and peacefully removed in relatively frequent, fair and free elections in which coercion is quite limited.
*Practically all adults have the right to vote in these elections.
*Most adults also have the right to run for the public offices for which candidates run in these elections.
*Citizens have an effectively enforced right to freedom of expression, particularly political expression, including criticism of the officials, the conduct of the government, the prevailing political, economic, and social system, and the dominant ideology.
*They also have access to alternative sources of information that are not monopolized by the government or any other single group.
*Finally, they have an effectively enforced right to form and join autonomous associations, including political associations, such as political parties and interest groups, that attempt to influence the government by competing in elections and by other peaceful means.

Dahl's Seven Sets of Conditions for Polyarchy are:

# Historical Sequence- peaceful evolution within an independent nation-state
# Socioeconomic Order-concentration- a competitive regime cannot be maintained in a country where military forces are accustomed to intervening
# Socioeconomic Order-level of development
## Provide literacy, education, communication
## Create a pluralistic social order
## Prevent Inequalities
#  Equalities and Inequalities
## Hegemonic regimes reduce public contestation
## Inequalities increase the chance comparative politics will displace hegemony
#  Subcultures, Cleavage Patterns and, Governmental Effectiveness
#  The Beliefs of Political Activists- treat them as major independent variables
#  Foreign Control- foreign domination can affect all the conditions and alter available options

== Characteristics ==
Polyarchy and its procedures by itself may be insufficient for achieving full democracy. For example, poor people may be unable to participate in the political process. It is thought so, because some authors see polyarchy as a form of government that is not intended for greater [[social justice]] and cultural realization and to allow the repressed to politically participate.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Gills, Joel Rocamora, and Richard Willson(eds), Low Intensity Democracy: Political power and the New World Order, Boulder, Westview, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[William I. Robinson]], it is a system where small group actually rules on behalf of capital, and majority’s decision making is confined to choosing among selective number of elites within tightly controlled elective process. It is a form of consensual domination made possible by the structural domination of the global capital which allowed concentration of political powers.&lt;ref&gt;William I Robinson Globalisation: nine thesis of our epoch, Race &amp; Class 38(2) 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, perceived polyarchies – such as the United States – may bar a substantial number of its citizens from participating in its national electoral process. For example, more than four million U.S. citizens residing in the [[U.S. territories]], such as [[Puerto Rico]], [[Guam]] and the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]], are excluded from participating in the election of any voting-member of Congress, which are the political bodies that hold ultimate sovereignty over them. Robinson argues that they are effectively taxed without lawful representation (although the current status of these territories is as a matter of popular consensus in individual cases).&lt;ref&gt;Raskin, James B. (2003). ''Overruling Democracy: The Supreme Court Vs. the American People''. London and New York: Routledge, pp. 36–38. {{ISBN|0-415-93439-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Torruella"&gt;{{cite book |last=Torruella |first=Juan R. |title=The Supreme Court and Puerto Rico: The doctrine of separate and unequal |publisher=University of Puerto Rico |date=1985 |location=Río Piedras, Puerto Rico |isbn=9780847730193 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Preface to Democratic Theory'' (1956) Dahl argues that an increase in citizen political involvement may not always be beneficial for polyarchy. An increase in the political participation of members of less educated classes, for example, could reduce the support for the basic norms of polyarchy, because members of those classes are more pre-disposed to be authoritarian-minded.&lt;ref&gt;Dahl, ''Preface to Democratic Theory'', p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Michels2004"&gt;{{cite conference|last=Michels|first=Ank|date=13–18 April 2004|title=Citizen participation and democracy in the Netherlands|url=http://www.essex.ac.uk/ecpr/events/jointsessions/paperarchive/uppsala/ws12/Michels.pdf|conference=National Traditions of Democratic Thought, ECPR Joint Sessions|location=Uppsala, Sweden|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050510214639/http://www.essex.ac.uk/ecpr/events/jointsessions/paperarchive/uppsala/ws12/Michels.pdf|archive-date=10 May 2005|access-date=30 Nov 2016|conference-url=https://ecpr.eu/Events/PanelList.aspx?EventID=49}}&lt;!-- https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=13813&amp;EventID=49 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In a discussion of contemporary British foreign policy, [[Mark Curtis (British author)|Mark Curtis]] stated that "Polyarchy is generally what British leaders mean when they speak of promoting 'democracy' abroad.  This is a system in which a small group actually rules and mass participation is confined to choosing leaders in elections managed by competing elites."&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Curtis (British author)|Mark Curtis]], ''Web of Deceit: Britain's Real Role in the World'', p. 247, London: Vintage UK Random House. {{ISBN|0-09-944839-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, it is being promoted by the transnational elites in the South as a different form from the [[authoritarianism]] and [[dictatorship]] to the North as a part of [[Democracy Promotion]].&lt;ref&gt;William I Robinson Promoting polyarchy: 20 years later, p.228, International Relations 27(2) 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  Robinson argues that this is to cultivate transnational elites who will open up their countries following transnational agenda of [[neoliberalism]] where transnational capital mobility and globalized circuits of production and distribution is established. For example, it was promoted to Nicaragua, Chile, Haiti, the Philippines, South Africa and the former Soviet Bloc countries.&lt;ref&gt;William I Robinson Promoting polyarchy: 20 years later, p.230, International Relations 27(2) 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Quirks &amp; Quarks''''' ('''Quirks''') is a Canadian [[science]] news program, heard over [[CBC Radio One]] of the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC).

Airing since October 8, 1975, ''Quirks &amp; Quarks'' is consistently rated among the most popular CBC programs, attracting over 800,000 listeners each Saturday from 12:06 to 13:00.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/radio/quirks/about |title=CBC Radio : Quirks &amp; Quarks : About the Show|accessdate=2008-10-14 |work= |publisher=CBC Radio |date= |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080624201838/http://www.cbc.ca/radio/quirks/about &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show is also heard on [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] and some American public radio stations. The show consists of several segments each week, most of which involve the host interviewing a scientist about a recent discovery or publication, combined with in-depth documentaries; however, from time to time the show does a special "Question Show" episode, during which the format consists of scientists answering questions submitted by listeners.

''Quirks &amp; Quarks'' has offered listeners Internet audio streams and MP3 downloads on its web page since 1993. The MP3 audio files have been archived on the program web site, going back to Sept. 2006. In 2005, ''Quirks'' became the first major CBC show available as a podcast. Since the program began, it has won more than 80 national and international journalism awards, including the prestigious Walter Sullivan Award (twice) and the Science Writing Award from the American Institute of Physics (twice).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/radio/quirks/about/awards |title=Quirks &amp; Quarks Awards |publisher=CBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Thermodynamics|cTopic=[[Thermodynamic system|Systems]]}}

In [[thermodynamics]], a '''reversible process''' is a [[Thermodynamic process|process]] whose direction can be "reversed" by inducing [[infinitesimal]] changes to some property of the [[Thermodynamic system|system]] via its [[Thermodynamic system#Surroundings|surroundings]].&lt;ref name="sears"&gt;Sears, F.W. and Salinger, G.L. (1986), ''Thermodynamics, Kinetic Theory, and Statistical Thermodynamics'', 3rd edition (Addison-Wesley.)&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the entire reversible process, the system is in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] with its surroundings. Having been reversed, it leaves no change in either the system or the surroundings. Since it would take an infinite amount of time for the reversible process to finish, perfectly reversible processes are impossible. However, if the system undergoing the changes responds much faster than the applied change, the deviation from reversibility may be negligible. In a ''reversible cycle'', a [[Thermodynamic process#Cyclic process|cyclical]] reversible process, the system and its surroundings will be returned to their original states if one half cycle is followed by the other half cycle.&lt;ref name="zumdahl"&gt;Zumdahl, Steven S. (2005) "10.2 The Isothermal Expansion and Compression of an Ideal Gas." Chemical Principles. 5th Edition. (Houghton Mifflin Company)&lt;/ref&gt;

Thermodynamic processes can be carried out in one of two ways: reversibly or irreversibly. Reversibility means  the reaction operates continuously at quasiequilibrium. In an ideal thermodynamically reversible process, the energy from work performed by or on the system would be maximized, and that from heat would be zero. However, heat cannot fully be converted to work and will always be lost to some degree (to the surroundings). (This is true only in case of a cycle. In case of an ideal process, heat can be completely converted into work, e.g., isothermal expansion of an ideal gas in a piston-cylinder arrangement.) The phenomenon of maximized work and minimized heat can be visualized on a pressure-volume curve, as the area beneath the equilibrium curve, representing work done. In order to maximize work, one must follow the equilibrium curve precisely. 

Irreversible processes, on the other hand, are a result of straying away from the curve, therefore decreasing the amount of overall work done; an irreversible process can be described as a thermodynamic process that departs from equilibrium. Irreversibility is defined as the difference between the reversible work and the actual work for a process. When described in terms of pressure and volume, it occurs when the pressure (or the volume) of a system changes so dramatically and instantaneously that the volume (or the pressure) does not have time to reach equilibrium. A classic example of irreversibility is allowing a certain volume of gas to be released into a vacuum. By releasing pressure on a sample and thus allowing it to occupy a large space, the system and surroundings are not in equilibrium during the expansion process and there is little work done.  However, significant work will be required, with a corresponding amount of energy dissipated as heat flow to the environment, in order to reverse the process (compressing the gas back to its original volume and temperature). &lt;ref name=Entropy&gt;Lower, S. (2003) ''Entropy Rules! What is Entropy?'' [http://www.chem1.com/acad/webtext/thermeq/TE2.html Entropy]&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative definition of a ''reversible process'' is a process that, after it has taken place, can be reversed and, when reversed, returns the system and its surroundings to their initial states. In thermodynamic terms, a process "taking place" would refer to its transition from one [[thermodynamic state|state]] to another.

== Irreversibility ==

In an [[irreversible process]], finite changes are made; therefore the system is not at equilibrium throughout the process. At the same point in an irreversible cycle, the system will be in the same state, but the surroundings are permanently changed after each cycle.&lt;ref name="zumdahl" /&gt; It is the difference between the reversible work and the actual work for a process as shown in the following equation : I = ''W''&lt;sub&gt; ''rev''&lt;/sub&gt; - ''W''&lt;sub&gt; ''a''&lt;/sub&gt;

[[Image:Adjabatic-revisible-state-change.svg|thumb|Reversible [[Adiabatic Process|adiabatic]] process: The state on the left can be reached from the state on the right as well as vice versa without exchanging heat with the environment.]]

== Boundaries and states ==

A reversible process changes the state of a system in such a way that the net change in the combined [[entropy]] of the system and its surroundings is zero. Reversible processes define the boundaries of how [[mechanical efficiency|efficient]] [[heat engines]] can be in thermodynamics and engineering: a reversible process is one where no heat is lost from the system as "waste", and the machine is thus as efficient as it can possibly be (see [[Carnot cycle]]).

In some cases, it is important to distinguish between reversible and [[quasistatic processes]]. Reversible processes are always quasistatic, but the converse is not always true.&lt;ref name="sears" /&gt; For example, an infinitesimal compression of a gas in a cylinder where there exists [[friction]] between the piston and the cylinder is a quasistatic, but not reversible process.&lt;ref name="giancoli"&gt;Giancoli, D.C. (2000), ''Physics for Scientists and Engineers (with Modern Physics)'', 3rd edition (Prentice-Hall.)&lt;/ref&gt; Although the system has been driven from its equilibrium state by only an infinitesimal amount, heat has been irreversibly lost due to [[friction]], and cannot be recovered by simply moving the piston infinitesimally in the opposite direction.

== Engineering archaisms ==

[[Archaism|Historically]], the term '''''Tesla principle''''' was used to describe (amongst other things) certain reversible processes invented by [[Nikola Tesla]].&lt;ref name="elexp"&gt;''[[Electrical Experimenter]]'', January 1919. p. 615.  [http://www.teslasociety.com/pictures/teslaxc4.jpg]&lt;/ref&gt; However, this phrase is no longer in conventional use. The principle stated that some systems could be reversed and operated in a complementary manner. It was developed during Tesla's research in [[alternating current]]s where the current's magnitude and direction varied cyclically. During a demonstration of the [[Tesla turbine]], the disks revolved and machinery fastened to the shaft was operated by the engine. If the turbine's operation was reversed, the disks acted as a [[pump]].&lt;ref name="tribune"&gt;"Tesla's New Monarch of Machines". ''New York Herald Tribune'', Oct. 15, 1911. (Available online.  Tesla Engine Builders Association. [http://my.execpc.com/~teba/main.html#TE])&lt;/ref&gt;

Classical thermodynamics considers three main kinds of thermodynamic process: change in a system, cycles in a system,  and flow processes.

Defined by change in a system, a '''thermodynamic process''' is a passage of a [[thermodynamic system]] from an initial to a final [[thermodynamic state|state]] of [[thermodynamic equilibrium]]. The initial and final states are the defining elements of the process. The actual course of the process is not the primary concern, and thus often is ignored. This is the customary default meaning of the term 'thermodynamic process'. In general, during the actual course of a thermodynamic process, the system passes through physical states which are not describable as thermodynamic states, because they are far from internal thermodynamic equilibrium. Such processes are useful for thermodynamic theory.

Defined by a cycle of transfers into and out of a system, a '''cyclic process''' is described by the quantities transferred in the several stages of the cycle, which recur unchangingly. The descriptions of the staged states of the system are not the primary concern. Cyclic processes were important conceptual devices in the early days of thermodynamical investigation, while the concept of the thermodynamic state variable was being developed.

Defined by flows through a system, a '''flow process''' is a steady state of flows into and out of a vessel with definite wall properties. The internal state of the vessel contents is not the primary concern. The quantities of primary concern describe the states of the inflow and the outflow materials, and, on the side, the transfers of heat, work, and kinetic and potential energies for the vessel. Flow processes are of interest in engineering.

==Kinds of process==

===Thermodynamic process===

Defined by change in a system, a thermodynamic process is a passage of a [[thermodynamic system]] from an initial to a final [[thermodynamic state|state]] of [[thermodynamic equilibrium]]. The initial and final states are the defining elements of the process. The actual course of the process is not the primary concern, and often is ignored. A state of thermodynamic equilibrium endures unchangingly unless it is interrupted by a thermodynamic operation that initiates a thermodynamic process. The equilibrium states are each respectively fully specified by a suitable set of thermodynamic [[state function|state variables]], that depend only on the current state of the system, not the path taken by the processes that produce that state. In general, during the actual course of a thermodynamic process, the system passes through physical states which are not describable as thermodynamic states, because they are far from internal thermodynamic equilibrium. Such a process may therefore be admitted for non-equilibrium thermodynamics, but not be admitted for equilibrium thermodynamics, which primarily aims to describe the continuous passage along the path, at definite rates of progress.

Though not so in general, it is, however, possible, that a process may take place slowly or smoothly enough to allow its description to be usefully approximated by a continuous path of equilibrium thermodynamic states. Then it may be approximately described by a [[process function]] that does depend on the path. Such a process may be idealized as a "quasi-static" process, which is infinitely slow, and which is really a theoretical exercise in differential geometry, as opposed to an actually possible physical process; in this idealized case, the calculation may be exact, though the process does not actually occur in nature. Such idealized processes are useful in the theory of thermodynamics.

===Cyclic process===

Defined by a cycle of transfers into and out of a system, a cyclic process is described by the quantities transferred in the several stages of the cycle.  The descriptions of the staged states of the system may be of little or even no interest. A cycle is a sequence of a small number of thermodynamic processes that indefinitely often repeatedly returns the system to its original state. For this, the staged states themselves are not necessarily described, because it is the transfers that are of interest. It is reasoned that if the cycle can be repeated indefinitely often, then it can be assumed that the states are recurrently unchanged. The condition of the system during the several staged processes may be of even less interest than is the precise nature of the recurrent states. If, however, the several staged processes are idealized and quasi-static, then the cycle is described by a path through a continuous progression of equilibrium states.

===Flow process===

Defined by flows through a system, a flow process is a steady state of flow into and out of a vessel with definite wall properties. The internal state of the vessel contents is not the primary concern. The quantities of primary concern describe the states of the inflow and the outflow materials, and, on the side, the transfers of heat, work, and kinetic and potential energies for the vessel. The states of the inflow and outflow materials consist of their internal states, and of their kinetic and potential energies as whole bodies. Very often, the quantities that describe the internal states of the input and output materials are estimated on the assumption that they are bodies in their own states of internal thermodynamic equilibrium. Because rapid reactions are permitted, the thermodynamic treatment may be approximate, not exact.

==A cycle of quasi-static processes==
{{Main article|Stirling cycle}}
[[File:Stirling Cycle color.png|thumb|left|An example of a cycle of idealized thermodynamic processes which make up the [[Stirling cycle]]]]
A quasi-static thermodynamic process can be visualized by [[thermodynamic diagram|graphically plotting]] the path of idealized changes to the system's [[state variable]]s.  In the example, a cycle consisting of four quasi-static processes is shown. Each process has a well-defined start and end point in the pressure-volume [[state space]].  In this particular example, processes 1 and 3 are [[isothermal]], whereas processes 2 and 4 are [[isochoric process|isochoric]]. The [[PV diagram]] is a particularly useful visualization of a quasi-static process, because the area under the curve of a process is the amount of [[work (thermodynamics)|work]] done by the system during that process. Thus work is considered to be a [[process variable]], as its exact value depends on the particular path taken between the start and end points of the process. Similarly, [[heat]] may be transferred during a process, and it too is a process variable.

==Conjugate variable processes==
It is often useful to group processes into pairs, in which each variable held constant is one member of a [[conjugate variables (thermodynamics)|conjugate]] pair.

===Pressure - volume===
The pressure-volume conjugate pair is concerned with the transfer of mechanical or dynamic energy as the result of work.

* An '''[[isobaric process]]''' occurs at constant pressure. An example would be to have a movable piston in a cylinder, so that the pressure inside the cylinder is always at atmospheric pressure, although it is separated from the atmosphere. In other words, the system is '''dynamically connected''', by a movable boundary, to a constant-pressure reservoir.
* An '''[[isochoric process]]''' is one in which the volume is held constant, with the result that the mechanical PV work done by the system will be zero. On the other hand, work can be done isochorically on the system, for example by a shaft that drives a rotary paddle located inside the system. It follows that, for the simple system of one deformation variable, any heat energy transferred to the system externally will be absorbed as internal energy. An isochoric process  is also known as an '''isometric''' process or an '''isovolumetric''' process. An example would be to place a closed tin can of material into a fire. To a first approximation, the can will not expand, and the only change will be that the contents gain internal energy, evidenced by increase in temperature and pressure. Mathematically, &lt;math&gt;\delta Q=dU&lt;/math&gt;. The system is '''dynamically insulated''', by a rigid boundary, from the environment.

===Temperature - entropy===
The temperature-entropy conjugate pair is concerned with the transfer of energy, especially for a closed system.

* An '''[[isothermal process]]''' occurs at a constant temperature. An example would be a closed system immersed in and '''thermally connected''' with a large constant-temperature bath. Energy gained by the system, through work done on it, is lost to the bath, so that its temperature remains constant.
* An '''[[adiabatic process]]''' is a process in which there is no matter or heat transfer, because a '''thermally insulating wall''' separates the system from its surroundings. For the process to be natural, either (a) work must be done on the system at a finite rate, so that the internal energy of the system increases; the entropy of the system increases even though it is thermally insulated; or (b) the system must do work on the surroundings, which then suffer increase of entropy, as well as gaining energy from the system.
* An '''[[isentropic process]]''' is customarily defined as an idealized quasi-static reversible adiabatic process, of transfer of energy as work. Otherwise, for a constant-entropy process, if work is done irreversibly, heat transfer is necessary, so that the process is not adiabatic, and an accurate artificial control mechanism is necessary; such is therefore not an ordinary natural thermodynamic process.

===Chemical potential - particle number===
The processes just above have assumed that the boundaries are also impermeable to particles. Otherwise, we may assume boundaries that are rigid, but are permeable to one or more types of particle. Similar considerations then hold for the [[chemical potential]]–[[particle number]] conjugate pair, which is concerned with the transfer of energy via this transfer of particles.

* In a ''constant chemical potential process'' the system is ''particle-transfer connected'', by a particle-permeable boundary, to a constant-µ reservoir. &lt;!-- An example would be ???.--&gt;
* The conjugate here is a constant particle number process. These are the processes outlined just above. There is no energy added or subtracted from the system by particle transfer. The system is ''particle-transfer-insulated'' from its environment by a boundary that is impermeable to particles, but permissive of transfers of energy as work or heat. These processes are the ones by which thermodynamic work and heat are defined, and for them, the system is said to be [[Thermodynamics#System models|closed]].

==Thermodynamic potentials==
Any of the [[thermodynamic potential]]s may be held constant during a process. For example:

* An '''[[isenthalpic process]]''' introduces no change in [[enthalpy]] in the system.

==Polytropic processes==
{{main article|Polytropic process}}

A '''polytropic process''' is a thermodynamic process that obeys the relation:

:&lt;math&gt;P V^{\,n} = C,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''P'' is the pressure, ''V'' is volume, ''n'' is any [[real number]] (the "polytropic index"), and ''C'' is a constant.  This equation can be used to accurately characterize processes of certain [[thermodynamic system|system]]s, notably the [[compression (physical)|compression]] or [[Thermal expansion|expansion]] of a [[gas]], but in some cases, [[liquid]]s and [[solid]]s.

==Processes classified by the [[second law of thermodynamics]]==

According to Planck, one may think of three main classes of thermodynamic process: natural, fictively reversible, and impossible or unnatural.&lt;ref name="Guggenheim"&gt;[[Edward A. Guggenheim|Guggenheim, E.A.]] (1949/1967). ''Thermodynamics. An Advanced Treatment for Chemists and Physicists'', fifth revised edition, North-Holland, Amsterdam, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[László Tisza|Tisza, L.]] (1966). ''Generalized Thermodynamics'', M.I.T. Press, Cambridge MA, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural process===

Only natural processes occur in nature. For thermodynamics, a natural process is a transfer between systems that increases the sum of their entropies, and is irreversible.&lt;ref name="Guggenheim"/&gt; Natural processes may occur spontaneously, or may be triggered in a [[Metastability|metastable]] or unstable system, as for example in the condensation of a supersaturated vapour.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Planck|Planck, M.]](1897/1903). [https://archive.org/details/treatiseonthermo00planrich ''Treatise on Thermodynamics'', translated by A. Ogg, Longmans, Green &amp; Co., London], p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fictively reversible process===

To describe the geometry of graphical surfaces that illustrate equilibrium relations between thermodynamic functions of state, one can fictively think of so-called "reversible processes". They are convenient theoretical objects that trace paths across graphical surfaces. They are called "processes" but do not describe naturally occurring processes, which are always irreversible. Because the points on the paths are points of thermodynamic equilibrium, it is customary to think of the "processes" described by the paths as fictively "reversible".&lt;ref name="Guggenheim"/&gt; [[reversible process (thermodynamics)|Reversible processes]] are always quasistatic processes, but the converse is not always true.

===Unnatural process===
Unnatural processes are logically conceivable but do not occur in nature. They would decrease the sum of the entropies if they occurred.&lt;ref name="Guggenheim"/&gt;

===Quasistatic process===
{{main article|Quasistatic process}}

A '''quasistatic process''' is an idealized or fictive model of a thermodynamic "process" considered in theoretical studies. It does not occur in physical reality. It may be imagined as happening infinitely slowly so that the system passes through a continuum of states that are infinitesimally close to [[thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]].
