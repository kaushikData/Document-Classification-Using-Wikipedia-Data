==Biography==

Al-Hamawi came from [[Qalaat al-Madiq]], [[Hama Governorate|Hama]], [[Syria]]. He trained as a [[civil engineer]] and studied at [[Tishreen University]] in [[Latakia]].&lt;ref name='ottawa' /&gt;&lt;ref name='chicago' /&gt;&lt;ref name='japan' /&gt;&lt;ref name='reuters' /&gt; He was with [[Hadi Al Abdullah]] who was a journalist during the civil war. He was an [[Activism|activist]] and an [[Prisoner|inmate]] of the "[[Islamism|Islamist]] wing" of the Syrian government’s main political prison in [[Sednaya Prison|Sednaya]] from 2007 to 2011. An article in the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' described him as a "[[political prisoner]]".&lt;ref name='toronto' /&gt; He was released in 2011, when the [[Civil uprising phase of the Syrian Civil War|Syrian uprising]] began.&lt;ref name='ottawa' /&gt;&lt;ref name='chicago' /&gt;&lt;ref name='japan' /&gt;

He later became leader of the Osama bin Zeid Company, a [[militia]] based around his hometown of Qalaat al-Madiq, and then rose through the ranks to become leader of Ahrar al-Sham in September 2015.&lt;ref name=Lund_blog&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.joshualandis.com/blog/abu-yahia-al-hamawi-ahrar-al-shams-new-leader/ |title=Abu Yahia al-Hamawi, Ahrar al-Sham’s New Leader |first=Aron |last=Lund |work=Syria Comment |date=12 September 2015|accessdate=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[Al-Monitor]]'', the change is leadership is said to have made Ahrar Al-Sham "more palatable to [[Western world|the West]]" since al-Hamawi "is seen as someone who will fit the 'moderate Salafist' image Ahrar al-Sham wants to have".&lt;ref name='monitor' /&gt; According to ''[[The Daily Beast]]'', al-Hamawi claimed that "Ahrar al-Sham was [[mainstream]] and aligned with Western interests."&lt;ref name='dailybeast'&gt;{{cite news |title=In the Syrian Ceasefire Shell Game, the Good Guys May Be Bad Guys |first=Alexander |last=Decina |url= http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/03/01/in-the-syrian-ceasefire-shell-game-the-good-guys-may-be-bad-guys.html |newspaper=''[[The Daily Beast]]'' |date=1 March 2016 |accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2015, al-Hamawi sent Labib al-Nahhas to [[Riyadh]], [[Saudi Arabia]] in order to participate in the Saudi-led rebel conference that produced the [[High Negotiations Committee]] (HNC).&lt;ref name='dailybeast' /&gt; Al-Hamawi has also falsely claimed that [[Al-Nusra Front|Al-Nusra]] had withdrawn from the [[Army of Conquest]].&lt;ref name='dailybeast' /&gt;

His term as leader could have been extended,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sources to Qasioun: Ahrar Alsham movement looking for new leader |url= https://www.qasioun.net/en/news/show/42006/Sources_to_Qasioun_Ahrar_Alsham_movement_looking_for_new_leader |newspaper=Qasioun News |date=10 November 2016 |accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the Shura Council of Ahrar al-Sham appointed [[Ali al-Omar]] as leader in November 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Latest: Turkey says 2 soldiers missing in Syria |first=Sarah |last=El Deeb |url= https://apnews.com/8b5584705c6840af95342a92aa5c70fa |newspaper=AP |date=30 November 2016 |accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Association for Civil Rights in Israel''' (ACRI) ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: {{lang|he|האגודה לזכויות האזרח בישראל}}; [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: {{lang|ar|جمعية حقوق المواطن في اسرائيل}}) was created in 1972&lt;ref name="founded"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/features/to-each-his-own-justice-1.224169|title=To Each His Own Justice|publisher= Ha'aretz}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an independent, non-partisan [[not-for-profit organization]] with the mission of protecting [[human rights]] and [[civil rights]] in [[Israel]] and the [[Palestinian territories| territories]] under its control. ACRI is Israel’s oldest and largest human rights organization. Headquartered in [[Tel Aviv]], with offices in [[Jerusalem]], [[Nazareth]] and [[Be'er Sheva]], the organization promotes transparency and accountability in government.&lt;ref&gt;International Network of Civil Liberties Organizations, "[https://www.inclo.net/members/acri.html The Association for Civil Rights in Israel]," retrieved 9 May 2018&lt;/ref&gt; 

ACRI has been accused by critics, including former Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]], of defending terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=האגודה לזכויות האדם יוצאת מהקונסנסוס|url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/1.789329|date=25 April 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Established in 1972, ACRI views itself as being "committed to promoting the universality of human rights and defending the human rights and civil liberties of all, regardless of religion, nationality, gender, ethnicity, political affiliation, sexual orientation, or socioeconomic background."&lt;ref name="mission"/&gt;  The association established its views based on the basic rights recognized in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in 1948, and the values in [[Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

In 1981, ACRI instituted a human rights award to be given to "individuals and organizations that have made a outstanding contribution to the advancement of [[human rights]] in [[Israel]]". The award was renamed in 1983 as the "[[Emil Grunzweig Human Rights Award]]."&lt;ref name="award"&gt;The Association For Civil Rights in Israel. ''The Emil Grunzweig Human Rights Award: The First 30 Years 1981-2011''. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, ACRI organized what has become an annual "Human Rights March" to mark [[International Human Rights Day]] (December 10) in Tel Aviv.&lt;ref name="march1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Headlines/Article.aspx?id=293479|date=November 26, 2012|title=Thousands expected at fourth annual Human Rights March|newspaper=Jerusalem Post|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121130020813/http://www.jpost.com/Headlines/Article.aspx?id=293479|archive-date=30 November 2012|accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activity ==

ACRI’s Legal Department argues cases before the [[Supreme Court of Israel]], and also seeks redress before district and labor courts, government ministries, and [[Knesset]] committees.

ACRI’s Education Department conducts human rights training programs, produces educational curricula in [[Hebrew]] and [[Arabic]], and organizes conferences and lectures on human rights education. Additionally, ACRI operates a program on [[International Humanitarian Law]] (IHL) and offers IHL educational workshops to [[Activism| social activists]], students, educators, youth movement counselors, and students at pre-military academies to "enhance the participants’ knowledge of IHL, and to provide opportunities for discussion and for developing their positions on the issues involved."

ACRI publishes reports and information leaflets; organizes lectures, conferences, film screenings and other public and community events covering a wide range of human rights issues; and runs a public hotline to assist people whose rights have been infringed.

Internationally, ACRI submits shadow reports and provides information to UN committees and representatives regarding Israel’s compliance with its human rights obligations; meets with foreign diplomats and government representatives; participates in international conferences and NGO networks; and raises awareness of human rights issues by generating ongoing international media coverage.

ACRI focus on issues pertaining to Arab Minority Rights, Anti-Democratic Initiatives, Freedom of Expression, LGBT Rights, [[East Jerusalem]], Human Rights Defenders in the [[Occupied Palestinian Territories]] (OPT), Migrant Workers, Child Rights, [[Negev Bedouins]], [[Refugees]] and [[Asylum Seekers]], Right to Health, Women's Rights, and the Right to Housing.&lt;ref name="issues"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acri.org.il/en/all-issues/|title=All Issues|publisher=Association for Civil Rights in Israel|accessdate=25 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

Though ACRI does not identify itself politically, activities of the association has been criticized as assisting organizations that harm Israel's [[national security]]. Such criticism was made by prime-minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]] over an appeal about exiling 400 [[Hamas]] activists to [[Lebanon]] in 1992. Rabin Called ACRI - "Association for Rights of Hamas".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=האגודה לזכויות האדם יוצאת מהקונסנסוס|url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/1.789329|date=25 April 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other right-wing activists have called it "Association for Palestinian Civil Rights".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=הצד ההומניסטי של האנטישמיות - בגליון השבוע|url=http://www.inn.co.il/Besheva/Article.aspx/2454|date=19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, Education Minister [[Naftali Bennett]] cancelled a conference to be held in cooperation with ACRI following a letter sent by a group of bereaved families accusing ACRI of defending [[terrorism| terrorists]]. ACRI denied the allegations and stated that it does not defend terrorists during their criminal proceedings, rather only in regards to their rights in prison and matters of citizenship and residency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Israeli Minister Axes Workshop With Biggest Civil Rights Group Over Claim It 'Defends Terrorists'|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.825541|website=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Emil Grunzweig human rights award ==

The [[Emil Grunzweig Human Rights Award]] is awarded annually by Association for Civil Rights in Israel to "individuals and organizations that have made a outstanding contribution to the advancement of [[human rights]] in [[Israel]]". The award was established in 1981 as an initiative by Professor Jacob Lorch, but was renamed in 1983 after the murder of activist [[Emil Grunzweig]] by a grenade thrown by a right-wing Israeli extremist during a [[Peace Now]] demonstration against the [[1982 Lebanon war|war in Lebanon]].&lt;ref name="award"/&gt;

The '''Bet-Nahrain Democratic Party''' ({{lang-syr|ܓܒܐ ܕܝܡܘܩܪܛܝܐ ܕܒܝܬ ܢܗܪܝܢ|Gaba Demoqrataya d-Bet-Nahrain}}), usually abbreviated as '''BNDP''' is an [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] political party in [[Iraq]] led by Romeo Nissan Hakkari. One of the party's goals is to create an [[Assyrian independence movement|autonomous Assyrian Administrative Region]] within the [[Assyrian homeland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://assyriatimes.com/engine/modules/news/article.php?storyid=3236 Bet-Nahrain Democratic Party's Declaration], ''Assyrian Times.com'', 2006-08-26, accessed on 2007-02-19&lt;/ref&gt;

== History == 

The BNDP was founded on the 21st of March 1974 as a union between the Bet-Nahrain Organization in [[California]] headed by Sargon Dadesho, and the Quest Movement in [[Chicago]] headed by notable individuals such as Gilyana Yonan. 

BNDP was influential in the development of the [[Assyrian flag]] in 1968 alongside the [[Assyrian Universal Alliance]] and the Assyrian National Federation. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ashurian |first1=Homer |title=Assyrian Flag |url=http://aua.net.au/assyrian-flag/ |website=AUA |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BNDP contested the [[Iraqi Kurdistan legislative election of 2005]] as part of the ruling [[Democratic Patriotic Alliance of Kurdistan]] and were allocated one seat for Romeo Hakkari. It also contested the [[Iraqi legislative election, January 2005]] as part of the Kurdish alliance, and Goriel Mineso Khamis was allocated one seat in the [[Council of Representatives of Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Assyrian elections in Iraq]]&lt;/ref&gt;

It did not participate in the [[Iraqi legislative election of December 2005]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fredaprim.com/pdfs/2005/Iraqi%20Elections%20December%2015.pdf The Iraqi National Elections and Our Moral Obligation], ''2005-11-08'', accessed on 2007-02-19&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Iraqi governorate elections of 2009]], the BNDP allied itself with the pro-Kurdish [[Chaldean Syriac Assyrian Popular Council]] in the [[Ishtar Patriotic List]]. The list won two seats in [[Baghdad governorate election, 2009|Baghdad]] and [[Ninawa governorate election, 2009|Ninawa]], including BNDP member Giwargis Esho Sada in Baghdad. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Teule |first1=Herman G.B. |title=Christians in Iraq An analysis of some recent political developments |page=185 |url=https://repository.ubn.ru.nl/bitstream/handle/2066/101464/101464.pdf?sequence=1 |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the 6th of January 2015, the BNDP and Bet-Nahrain Patriotic Union announced the formation of the [[Nineveh Plain Forces]] to protect the people of the [[Nineveh Plain]] and maintain control of the region for people that want to return to the area. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.syriacsnews.com/establishment-nineveh-plain-forces-npf/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.voanews.com/a/christian-iraqi-forces-join-fight-against-is/3181940.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1738">'''Cash-Over-Valuation''', or COV for short as it is commonly known in [[Singapore]], was a prevalent feature in the resale market for HDB ([[Housing Development Board]]) flats in Singapore for years until it was reviewed on 10 March 2014.&lt;ref name="hdb1"&gt;[http://www20.hdb.gov.sg/fi10/fi10296p.nsf/PressReleases/A656E10CAFBBD81948257C9700243AC0?OpenDocument "A Stable Housing Market, Better Homes for All"], [[HDB]], retrieved 30 Oct 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

COV can be defined as the difference between the resale price and the market value of the flat (HDB) that is paid by the buyer upfront.&lt;ref name="hdb2"&gt;[http://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/letters-to-keo/revised-hdb-resale-procedure], [[HDB]], retrieved 30 Oct 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 10 March 2014, a HDB resale flat begins with a professional valuation to discover the worth of the flat. The seller and buyer will negotiate about the amount to be paid above the valuation. This amount is the COV. The selling price will thus be the valuation plus COV.

If the flat is sold at valuation or below, no COV is paid.

However, COV has often been accused of causing volatility in the HDB resale flat market and  sharp price hikes.

Currently, HDB will accept valuation requests only from buyers or their salespersons, after the buyers have been granted an Option to Purchase by the flat sellers.

The '''Center on Conscience &amp; War''' ('''CCW''') is a [[United States]] [[non-profit organization|non-profit]] [[anti-war]] organization located in [[Washington, D.C.]] dedicated to defending and extending the rights of [[conscientious objector]]s. The group participates in the [[GI Rights Network|G.I. Rights Hotline]], and works against all forms of [[conscription]]. There are no charges for any of CCW's services.

The group was organized as ''National Council for Religious Conscientious Objectors'' on October 5, 1940 by the three [[peace churches|historic peace churches]] in response to the [[Selective Training and Service Act of 1940]], which introduced the first peacetime draft in the United States. The Selective Service Act provided for ''work of national importance'' and an alternative to military service for conscientious objectors. The immediate task of this group was to advise conscientious objectors and create a structure for the proposed alternative service. On November 26, 1940, ''National Council for Religious Conscientious Objectors'' was merged with a similar organization, ''Civilian Service Board'' to become ''National Service Board for Religious Objectors (NSBRO)''.

In the following months additional groups became interested in the work of NSBRO and positions on the governing board was expanded to include representatives from the [[Fellowship of Reconciliation]], Fellowship of Peace of the [[Methodist Church]], [[Disciples of Christ]] and Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America. During this first year a total of fifteen groups became members of NSBRO and by the end of the war this number grew to thirty nine.

[[Image:CPSCampsMap.jpg|thumb|NSBRO was responsible for 150 Civilian Public Service camps during World War II.]]
During its first year, 3000 conscientious objectors were referred to NSBRO by Selective Service. In all, nearly 12,000 World War II COs would be handled by NSBRO. The program for conscientious objectors, [[Civilian Public Service]] (CPS), was under civilian control with NSBRO responsible for working with the government and representing the interests of the churches and other groups involved.

The work of NSBRO was divided into three sections. The ''Camp Section'' selected sites, often former [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] facilities, for use as CPS base camps, The ''Assignment Section'' matched men with camps and units, keeping detailed records of the assignments and projects. The ''Complaint Section'' worked with cases of men who were denied conscientious objector status. Later an ''Advisory Section'' was created to track the changes in Selective Service regulations and interpret them to NSBRO constituency. Regular contact was made with COs who chose prison over CPS.

Conscientious objectors were required to serve into 1947, past the end of the war. Member groups who disagreed with this policy or the cooperation required with a system of conscription began to withdraw from the organization. [[War Resisters League]] pulled out early in the war, followed by Fellowship of Reconciliation, [[American Friends Service Committee]], and [[Association of Catholic Conscientious Objectors]]. The last CPS camp closed in April 1947, completing this phase of NSBRO work.

In 1964 the name was changed to ''National Interreligious Service Board for Conscientious Objectors (NISBCO)'' and in 2000 became ''Center on Conscience &amp; War (CCW).''

Today, the work of the Center on Conscience &amp; War is mainly with members of the US military who experience a crisis of conscience and seek discharge as conscientious objectors. CCW also provides technical and community support to other conscientious objectors, including immigrants seeking citizenship in the US who are moved by conscience to take an alternative oath of citizenship that does not include a promise to bear arms, and youth facing Selective Service (draft) registration.

'''Code Pink: Women for Peace''' is an internationally active [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] that describes itself as a "grassroots peace and social justice movement working to end U.S.-funded wars and occupations, to challenge militarism globally and to redirect our resources into health care, education, green jobs and other life-affirming activities". In addition to its focus on [[anti-war movement|anti-war]] issues, it has taken action on issues such as [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drones]] (including protests, trips to meet with drone victims in Pakistan and Yemen, bringing them to the US), [[Guantanamo Bay prison]] (including a delegation that included former prisoners and yearly protests at the White House), Palestinian statehood (including its involvement in the [[BDS movement]] to protest Ahava, SodaStream, ReMax, and AirBnB), the Iran nuclear deal, [[Saudi Arabia]] (including protests to end U.S. alliance with Saudi Arabia, its airstrikes on Yemen, and its executions of its political dissidents), and Women Cross DMZ. The organization characterizes itself as women-initiated.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/07/code-pink-john-brennan-senate-hearing Code Pink activists shown the red card at John Brennan Senate hearing]&lt;/ref&gt; It has regional offices in [[Los Angeles, California]] and [[Washington, D.C.]], and many more chapters in the U.S. as well as several in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.codepink4peace.org/article.php?list%3Dtype%26type%3D3 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-02-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212061706/http://www.codepink4peace.org/article.php?list=type&amp;type=3 |archivedate=2008-02-12 |df= }}.

==History==
[[File:161 Code Pink at Senator Nelson (39025312181).jpg|thumb|Code Pink protests Democrat senators who supported [[Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen]], December 2017]]
Code Pink was founded on November 17, 2002 by Americans [[Jodie Evans]], [[Medea Benjamin]] and other activists.&lt;ref name="cpab"/&gt; The group's name is a play on the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]]'s [[Homeland Security Advisory System|color-coded alert system]] in which, for example, Code Orange and Code Red signify the highest levels of danger.&lt;ref name=PinkFAQ&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.codepink4peace.org/section.php?id=207 |title=CODEPINK Frequently Asked Questions |accessdate=2008-02-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212013748/http://www.codepink4peace.org/section.php?id=207 |archivedate=2008-02-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2003, just weeks before the invasion of Iraq, Code Pink organized its first trip to that nation, and subsequently led five delegations there. These delegations included parents who had lost their children in Iraq, and parents of active soldiers. Additionally, they brought six Iraqi women on a tour of the United States, and published a report about how the U.S. occupation affected the [[Women's rights in Iraq|status of Iraqi women]].&lt;ref name=TN2006-03-20&gt;{{citation |date = 20 March 2006 |title = The Normalcy of Fear |first1 = Rachel |last1 = Corbett |first2 = Anja |last2 =Tranovich |work = The Nation

On its website, Code Pink lists allegations of U.S. war crimes, and states that thousands of civilians were killed in [[Fallujah]] in 2004 due to the actions of the U.S. military.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.codepinkalert.org/article.php?list=type&amp;type=22 Families For Peace Delegation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060704234352/http://www.codepinkalert.org/article.php?list=type&amp;type=22 |date=July 4, 2006 }}, Code Pink Website.

==Demonstrations at Walter Reed Medical Center==
Code Pink has also joined in vigils at the [[Walter Reed Medical Center]] in Washington, D.C. The group has been criticized for actions at the vigils: the criticism has centered on tactics such as displaying [[coffin]]s and chanting aggressive slogans. Speaking about the display of coffins, Kevin Pannell, an amputee and former patient at the hospital, said it "was probably the most distasteful thing I had ever seen. Ever. We went by there one day and I drove by and [the anti-war protesters] had a bunch of flag-draped coffins laid out on the sidewalk. You know that 95 percent of the guys in the hospital bed lost guys whenever they got hurt and [[Survivor guilt|survivors' guilt]] is the worst thing you can deal with."&lt;ref name=Cybercast&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewSpecialReports.asp?Page=%5CSpecialReports%5Carchive%5C200508%5CSPE20050825a.html |title=Anti-War Protests Target Wounded at Army Hospital |date=2005-08-25 |last=Morano |first=Marc |authorlink=Marc Morano |publisher=Cybercast News Service |accessdate=2008-01-31 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218212040/http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewSpecialReports.asp?Page=%5CSpecialReports%5Carchive%5C200508%5CSPE20050825a.html |archivedate=December 18, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; To those that faulted aggressive chants and signs, Code Pink responded that certain of the disruptive protesters were not part of their group and that they have asked these protesters to be respectful.&lt;ref name="vigil"&gt;{{cite press release|title=Statement on Vigil Outside of Walter Reed Hospital |publisher=Code Pink |date=2005-08-26 |url=http://www.codepink4peace.org/article.php?id=476 |accessdate=2008-01-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080114145909/http://www.codepink4peace.org//article.php?id=476 |archivedate=2008-01-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Code Pink says that the purpose of the vigils is to highlight the lack of care for veterans and claims that the vigils have helped spur improvements in that care.&lt;ref name="vigil" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Activists See Deception in Night Arrivals|publisher=Stars and Stripes |date=2005-03-31 |url=http://www.stripes.com/news/activists-see-deception-in-night-arrivals-at-walter-reed-1.31157|accessdate=22 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tucker Carlson interview==
Conservative talk-show host [[Tucker Carlson]] criticized Pink leader [[Medea Benjamin]] for her support of [[Hugo Chávez]]. She was quoted as saying that the charge in sections of the US media that Chavez had cracked down on free speech and civil rights in Venezuela was a myth.&lt;ref name=Carlson&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18941438|date=2007-05-30|title='Tucker' for May 29|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|accessdate=2008-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview on his [[MSNBC]] show, Benjamin was asked, "Do you want to revise that given the news that Hugo Chávez has closed the last nationally broadcast opposition television station for criticizing him?" Benjamin replied that it was not true and that Chavez simply did not renew the license because the station "participated in a coup against a democratically elected government, his [Chavez's] government." Benjamin also said "[[Peru]] recently did not renew a license. [[Uruguay]] didn‘t renew a license. Why do you hold Venezuela to a different standard?"&lt;ref name=Carlson/&gt; Carlson responded that a 360-page Venezuelan government-published book accused RCTV of showing lack of respect for authorities and institutions. Carlson asked Benjamin, "I would think, as a self-described liberal, you would stand up for the right of people to 'challenge authorities and institutions.' And yet you are apologizing for the squelching of minority views. Why could that be?" Benjamin replied that, "They [RCTV] falsified information. They got people out on the street. They falsified footage that showed pro-Chavez supporters killing people, which did not happen. They refuse to cover any of the pro-Chavez demonstrations."&lt;ref name=Carlson/&gt;

==Ground the Drones==
In the summer of 2009, Code Pink began their "Ground the Drones" campaign.&lt;ref name=Blanchard&gt;{{citation |last = Blanchard |first = Eric |contribution = The technoscience question in feminist International Relations: Unmanning the U.S. war on terror |title = Feminism and International Relations: Conversations about the past, present, and future |pages = 146–163 |editor1-last = Tickner |editor1-first = J. Ann |editor1-link =J. Ann Tickner |editor2-last = Sjoberg
 |editor2-first =Laura |editor2-link =Laura Sjoberg |publisher = London |year = 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This campaign was a response to the Obama administration's continued and increased use of unmanned drones in the "war on terror," specifically in regions surrounding Pakistan and Afghanistan.  Code Pink claimed that many of the drone strikes intended to target terrorist leaders and strongholds often miss their targets, causing the unnecessary deaths of innocent civilians.&lt;ref name=Pink&gt;{{cite web|title=Take Action! |url=http://www.codepink4peace.org/article.php?id=5974 |accessdate=21 Nov 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110033421/http://codepink4peace.org//article.php?id=5974 |archivedate=2013-11-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Ground the Drones" was fashioned as a form of non-violent, civil disobedience, similar to protests earlier that spring, by groups such as Voices for Creative Non Violence.&lt;ref name=Blanchard/&gt; Code Pink targeted Creech Air Force base in Indian Springs, Nevada, claiming it was the “epicenter” for controlling drone activity.&lt;ref name=Pink/&gt; The goal of  the protest was "halting unmanned aircraft strikes controlled via satellite links from Creech and other bases."&lt;ref name=Blanchard/&gt;  The group continued protesting at Creech AFB through November and December 2009.  Code Pink returned to Creech AFB in October 2011, along with other protest groups, to mark the 10th anniversary of the occupation of Afghanistan.  Protesters dubbed it the "largest anti-war demonstration ever at Creech Air Force Base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CODEPINK Joins Largest Ever Anti-Drone and Anti-Nuclear Actions Sunday at NNSS and Creech AFB |url=http://codepinkalert.org/article.php?id=5979&amp;printsafe=1#sthash.qe6zn80v.dpuf |date=7 Oct 2011 |accessdate=21 Nov 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111013213129/http://www.codepinkalert.org/article.php?id=5979&amp;printsafe=1 |archivedate=2011-10-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2013, Code Pink's national coordinator, Alli McCracken, disrupted the annual Aerial Unmanned Vehicles Systems Integrated summit, in Washington, DC.  During a speech advocating the full automation of unmanned drones, McCracken interrupted by shouting “Are you going to talk about the innocent people who have been killed by the drones?,” while producing a "STOP KILLER DRONES" banner, until she was escorted out by security.&lt;ref name="codepinkalert.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Codepink protester disrupts drone lobby summit, says it's time to ground the killer drones |url=http://codepinkalert.org/article.php?id=6467#sthash.d9f1W9NN.dpuf |date=13 August 2013 |accessdate=21 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109193932/http://www.codepinkalert.org//article.php?id=6467 |archivedate=9 November 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013, Code Pink organized a "Ground the Drones" summit. The summit took place over two days and was held at Georgetown University, in Washington, D.C.  The summit featured films pertaining to [[drone strike|drone warfare]], as well as a variety of guest speakers from various human rights and civil liberties organizations.  Topics of the summit included ethical and legal arguments surrounding drone warfare, as well as concerns over the use of drones domestically.&lt;ref name=Pink/&gt;

"Ground the Drones" has also attempted to involve American citizens in the fight to end drone warfare.  Code Pink's website advises readers to take action by, among other ways, contacting their local representatives, organizing film-screenings, and distributing pamphlets.&lt;ref name=Pink/&gt;

==Halloween 2009 White House protest==
On October 31, 2009, Code Pink organized a protest rally outside the [[White House]] to coincide with President and Mrs. Obama's official Halloween party. As many of the guests were family members of military personnel, the Code Pink press release encouraged attendees to dress as "zombie soldiers".&lt;ref name="CP Press release"&gt;[http://www.codepinkalert.org/article.php?id=5147 Code Pink Press Release] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019150739/http://www.codepinkalert.org/article.php?id=5147 |date=October 19, 2014 }} Accessed 21 Dec 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The event gained some notoriety when complaints surfaced about Reuters' characterization of their protest as "taunting" children, a characterization that Reuters stood by.&lt;ref name="Reuters GBU"&gt;[http://blogs.reuters.com/gbu/2009/11/02/taunting-children/ Reuters Reader Feedback Forum] Accessed 21 Dec 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gaza activities==
Code Pink has organized more than seven delegations to Gaza, some of them at the invitation of the United Nations. Critics have since accused Code Pink of working "closely with terrorist organizations and [[State Sponsors of Terrorism|states sponsors of terrorism]]" in Gaza and [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://biggovernment.com/taylorking/2010/01/12/hamas-terrorists-guaranteed-code-pinks-safety-in-gaza/ |title= |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=biggovernment.com |publisher=[[Breitbart News]] |access-date=August 1, 2016 |quote=}} Hamas Terrorists Guaranteed Code Pink’s Safety in Gaza{{deadlink|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the Gaza Freedom March, Code Pink endorsed the “Cairo Declaration to End Israeli Apartheid", which calls for comprehensive boycott of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2010/01/01/18633996.php Gaza Freedom Marchers issue the "Cairo Declaration" to end Israeli Apartheid&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Gaza Freedom March]], Code Pink co-founder [[Medea Benjamin]] coordinated the organization's stay with the [[Hamas]] terrorist group. Members resided in the Commodore, a Hamas-owned hotel in [[Gaza City]]. Hamas security officials accompanied activists as they visited Palestinian homes and Gaza-based NGOs.&lt;ref name="Hass"&gt;http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/week-s-end/pro-gaza-activists-under-siege-imposed-by-egypt-and-hamas-1.261009&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the march, Benjamin said the Hamas government had "pledged to ensure our safety."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.thereminder.com/localnews/GreaterSpringfield/massachusettswomen/  |title=We Are Hometown News - Massachusetts women march for freedom in the Middle East |publisher=The Reminder |date=2008-12-27 |accessdate=2010-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Code Pink leaders claimed Hamas had hijacked the initiative from the onset after imposing prohibitions on the organization's movements around Gaza. [[Amira Hass]] referred to the event as "an opportunity for Hamas cabinet ministers to get decent media coverage in the company of Western demonstrators."&lt;ref name=Hass/&gt;

Code Pink helped to organize an International Women's Day Delegation to Gaza in March 2014. Upon arrival at the Cairo airport on March 3, 2014, Medea Benjamin was detained and assaulted by Egyptian authorities. She was deported to Turkey after the authorities had dislocated her shoulder.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/05/world/middleeast/medea-benjamin-cairo-airport.html&lt;/ref&gt; Other members of the international delegation, including American, French, Belgian, and British citizens, who arrived the next day were also deported. Some members made it into Cairo, although no one from the delegation made it to Gaza.

==National Rifle Association Protest 2012==
Code Pink protesters were present at the [[National Rifle Association]]'s first press conference following the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting]], where N.R.A.'s Executive Vice President [[Wayne LaPierre]] advocated placing armed guards in schools and said "The only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is with a good guy with a gun."&lt;ref&gt;[http://codepink.org/article.php?id=6308 CODEPINK Protesters Unfurl Banners “NRA KILLING OUR KIDS” and “NRA BLOOD ON YOUR HANDS” at first NRA Press Conference after Newtown Shooting] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130113140244/http://codepink.org/article.php?id=6308 |date=2013-01-13 }}, [[Code Pink: Women for Peace]], Published December 21, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Rugg, [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2251762/NRA-statement-Sandy-Hook-shooting-Wayne-LaPierres-astonishing-response-calls-guns.html?offset=0&amp;max=100#comment-23392390 'The only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is with a good guy with a gun': NRA's astonishing response to Sandy Hook massacre - as protestors storm their first press conference since tragedy], The [[Daily Mail]], Published 21 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

About ten activists of Code Pink demonstrated in U.S. Congress against military attacks in retaliation for [[Syria]]'s suspected [[Syria and weapons of mass destruction|use of chemical weapons]] against its own people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ferraro |first=Thomas |title=Red-stained hands wave in protest at U.S. hearing on Syria |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/04/us-syria-crisis-redhands-idUSBRE98319L20130904 |newspaper=Reuters |date= 4 September 2013 |accessdate=4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/politics/one-winner-in-the-syria-debate-code-pink-20130910|title=One Winner in the Syria Debate: Code Pink|work=[[National Journal]]|date=2013-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Code Pink activists demonstrated in Capitol Hill against the [[2014 military intervention against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|American intervention in Syria and Iraq]] to stop [[ISIS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/17/john-kerry-code-pink_n_5838120.html|title=John Kerry Takes On Code Pink At ISIS Hearing|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=2014-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest during Sessions confirmation hearing==
Code Pink member Desiree Fairooz was arrested for laughing after a description of Senator [[Jeff Sessions]] by Alabama U.S. Senator [[Richard Shelby]] of the nominee as having a history of his "treating all Americans equally under the law is clear and well-documented," during the January 2017 confirmation hearing as [[United States Attorney General]]. After she had been convicted at trial, that verdict was reversed by the chief District Court Judge Robert Morin. The judge said Fairooz should not have been tried for laughing, only for speaking out as she was being removed, and called a mistrial. Instead of dismissing the case, Morin set her retrial for September.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/judge-throws-out-conviction-for-code-pink-activist-arrested-after-laughing-during-jeff-sessions-confirmation/article/2628748 Judge throws out conviction for Code Pink activist arrested after laughing during Jeff Sessions' confirmation], ''[[Washington Examiner]]'', Josh Siegel, July 14, 2017. Retrieved August 17, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
Fairooz faced up to a year in prison and $2,000 in fines for disruptive and [[disorderly conduct]] and obstructing and impeding passage on US Capitol grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Inklebarger|first1=Timothy|title=“Laughing Librarian” Gets the Last Laugh|url=https://americanlibrariesmagazine.org/blogs/the-scoop/justice-department-drops-case-laughing-librarian/|website=American Librarian|publisher=American Librarian|accessdate=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On November 6, 2017, District of Columbia U.S. Attorney [[Jessie K.

Upon the decision, Code Pink released a statement calling the 3 trials a waste of time and tens of thousands of taxpayer dollars, adding, "These sentences are designed to discourage [[dissent]] and prevent activists from engaging in the daily protests that are taking place during a tumultuous time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Benjamin|first1=Medea|title=CODEPINK Activist Arrested for Laughing at Jeff Sessions' Hearing Will Face Yet Another Trial|url=http://www.codepink.org/codepink_activist_arrested_for_laughing_at_jeff_sessions_hearing_will_face_yet_another_trial|website=CODEPINK|publisher=CODEPINK|accessdate=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the January 20th protests of the [[inauguration]] of [[Donald Trump]], the [[United States Department of Justice]] is prosecuting 200 people on multiple felony charges.&lt;ref name="Charges"/&gt;

'''Corruption''' is an issue that adversely affects [[India]]'s economy of central, state and local government agencies. Not only has it held the economy back from reaching new heights, but rampant corruption has stunted the country's development.&lt;ref name="tfe2010" /&gt; A study conducted by [[Transparency International]] in 2005 recorded that more than 92% of Indians had at some point or another paid a bribe to a public official to get a job done.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi/2010/results |title=Transparency International – the global coalition against corruption |publisher=Transparency.org |accessdate=7 October 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tmOICe1G?url=http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi/2010/results |archivedate=27 October 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2005-TI-study"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iri.org.in/related_readings/India%20Corruption%20Study%202005.pdf |title=India Corruption Study 2005: To Improve Governance: Volume I – Key Highlights New Delhi |publisher=Transparency International India |date=30 June 2005 |pages=1–3|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130811123343/http://www.iri.org.in/related_readings/India%20Corruption%20Study%202005.pdf|archivedate=11 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In a study conducted in 2008, Transparency International reported that about 50% of Indians had first hand experience of paying bribes or using contacts to get services performed by public offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=India Corruption Study – 2008|publisher=Transparency International|year=2008|url=http://www.transparencyindia.org/resource/survey_study/India%20Corruptino%20Study%202008.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619212155/http://www.transparencyindia.org/resource/survey_study/India%20Corruptino%20Study%202008.pdf|archivedate=19 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Transparency International]]'s 2017 [[Corruption Perception Index]] ranks the country 81st place out of 180 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2017|title=Corruption Perception Index 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180221190927/https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2017|archive-date=21 February 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest contributors to corruption are entitlement programs and social spending schemes enacted by the Indian government. Examples include the [[Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act]] and the [[National Rural Health Mission]].&lt;ref name="ft072012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="econ1" /&gt; Other areas of corruption include India's trucking industry which is forced to pay billions of rupees in bribes annually to numerous regulatory and police stops on interstate highways.&lt;ref name="asia2009" /&gt;

The media has widely published allegations of corrupt Indian citizens stashing millions of rupees in [[Swiss bank]]s. Swiss authorities denied these allegations, which were later proven in 2015–2016. The Indian media is largely controlled by extremely corrupt politicians and industrialists who play a major role by misleading the public with incorrect information and use the media for mud-slinging at political and business opponents.&lt;ref name=fm2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=swissinfo/&gt;

The causes of '''corruption in India''' include excessive regulations, complicated tax and licensing systems, numerous government departments with opaque bureaucracy and discretionary powers, monopoly of government controlled institutions on certain goods and services delivery, and the lack of transparent laws and processes.&lt;ref name=kpmg2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=WFR2011/&gt; There are significant variations in the level of corruption and in the government's efforts to reduce corruption across different areas of India.

Corruption in India is a problem that has serious implications for protecting the [[rule of law]] and ensuring access to justice. {{As of|December 2009}}, 120 of India's 524 parliament members were accused of various crimes, under India's [[First Information Report]] procedure wherein anyone can allege another to have committed a crime.&lt;ref name="tax"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/specialreports/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12749771|title=A special report on India: The democracy tax is rising: Indian politics is becoming ever more labyrinthine|date=11 December 2008|work=The Economist|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220163843/http://www.economist.com/specialreports/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12749771|archivedate=20 December 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the biggest scandals {{As of|since=yes|lc=yes|2010}} have involved high level government officials, including Cabinet Ministers and Chief Ministers, such as the [[Concerns and controversies over the 2010 Commonwealth Games|2010 Commonwealth Games scam]] ({{INRConvert|70000|c}}), the [[Adarsh Housing Society scam]], the [[Coal Mining Scam]] ({{INRConvert|1.86|lc}}), the [[Mining scams in India#Illegal iron ore mining in Karnataka|Mining Scandal in Karnataka]] and the [[Cash-for-votes scandal|Cash for Vote scam]]s.{{Clear}}

==Bureaucracy==
A 2005 study done by the [[Transparency International]] in India found that more than 92% of the people had firsthand experience of paying bribes or peddling influence to get services performed in a public office.&lt;ref name="2005-TI-study" /&gt; Taxes and bribes are common between state borders; Transparency International estimates that truckers annually pay {{INRConvert|222|c}} in bribes.&lt;ref name=asia2009&gt;{{cite news|title=Cops turn robbers on India's roads|publisher=Asia Online|date=27 August 2009 |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/KH27Df03.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ctoi/&gt;

Both government regulators and police share in bribe money, to the tune of 43% and 45% each, respectively. The en route stoppages at checkpoints and entry-points can take up to 11 hours per day. About 60% of these (forced) stoppages on roads by concerned authorities such as government regulators, police, forest, sales and excise, octroi, and weighing and measuring departments are for extorting money. The loss in productivity due to these stoppages is an important national concern; the number of truck trips could increase by 40%, if forced delays are avoided. According to a 2007 World Bank published report, the travel time for a Delhi-Mumbai trip could be reduced by about 2 days per trip if the corruption and associated regulatory stoppages to extract bribes were eliminated.&lt;ref name=ctoi&gt;{{cite web |title= Corruption in Trucking Operations in India |author= MDRA |publisher= The World Bank |date= February 2007 |url= http://info.worldbank.org/etools/ANTIC/docs/Resources/Sectors/Transport/CorrTruckingIndia.pdf |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120410073806/http://info.worldbank.org/etools/ANTIC/docs/Resources/Sectors/Transport/CorrTruckingIndia.pdf |archivedate= 10 April 2012 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="How much do the corrupt earn"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= UP trucker won't give bribe, pays with his life |work= Indian Express |date= 27 September 2011 |url= http://www.indianexpress.com/news/up-trucker-wont-give-bribe-pays-with-his-life/852415/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2009 survey of the leading economies of Asia, revealed [[Indian bureaucracy]] to be not only the least efficient out of Singapore, Hong Kong, Thailand, South Korea, Japan, Malaysia, Taiwan, Vietnam, China, Philippines and Indonesia, but that working with India's civil servants was a "slow and painful" process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/India/Indian-bureaucracy-ranked-worst-in-Asia-Survey/articleshow/4612918.cms Indian bureaucracy ranked worst in Asia: Survey] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615000205/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/India/Indian-bureaucracy-ranked-worst-in-Asia-Survey/articleshow/4612918.cms |date=15 June 2009 }} ''[[The Times of India]]'', 3 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Land and property===
{{See also|Illegal housing in India}}

Officials are alleged to steal state property. In cities and villages throughout India, groups of municipal and other government officials, elected politicians, judicial officers, real estate developers and law enforcement officials, acquire, develop and sell land in illegal ways.&lt;ref name="gupta2008"&gt;K.R. Gupta and J.R. Gupta, ''Indian Economy, Vol #2'', Atlantic Publishers &amp; Distributors, 2008, {{ISBN|81-269-0926-9}}. Snippet: ''... the land market already stands subverted and an active land mafia has already been created ...''&lt;/ref&gt; Such officials and politicians are very well protected by the immense power and influence they possess. Apart from this, slum-dwellers who are allotted houses under several housing schemes such as Pradhan Mantri Gramin Awaas Yojana, Rajiv Awas Yojna, Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna etc., rent out these houses to others, to earn money due to severe unemployment and lack of a steady source of income.

===Tendering processes and awarding contracts===
A 2006 report claimed state-funded construction activities in [[Uttar Pradesh]], such as road building were dominated by construction mafias, consisting of cabals of corrupt public works officials, materials suppliers, politicians and construction contractors.&lt;ref name="indiatoday2006"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives.digitaltoday.in/indiatoday/20061016/state-up.html |title=Mulayam Hits Mafia Hard |website=India Today |date=16 October 2006 |accessdate=30 October 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110705052538/http://archives.digitaltoday.in/indiatoday/20061016/state-up.html |archivedate=5 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }} Snippet: ''... The road sector has always been the main source of income for the mafia. They either ask their men directly to grab the contracts or allow an outsider to take the contract after accepting a hefty commission''&lt;/ref&gt;

Problems caused by corruption in government funded projects are not limited to the state of Uttar Pradesh. According to The World Bank, aid programmes are beset by corruption, bad administration and under-payments. As an example, the report cites that only 40% of grain handed out for the poor reaches its intended target.

For example, the government implemented the ''[[Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act]]'' (MGNREGA) on 25 August 2005. The Central government outlay for this welfare scheme is {{INRConvert|400|c}} in FY 2010–2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrega.nic.in/netnrega/home.aspx Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120621141533/http://nrega.nic.in/netnrega/home.aspx |date=21 June 2012 }}. Govt of India&lt;/ref&gt; After 5 years of implementation, in 2011, the programme was widely criticised as no more effective than other poverty reduction programmes in India. Despite its best intentions, MGNREGA faces the challenges of corrupt officials reportedly pocketing money on behalf of fake rural employees, poor quality of the programme infrastructure, and unintended destructive effect{{clarify|date=May 2013}} on poverty.&lt;ref name=econ1&gt;{{cite news|title=Indian rural welfare – Digging holes|work=The Economist|date=5 November 2011|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21536642|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609205426/http://www.economist.com/node/21536642|archivedate=9 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wsj1&gt;{{cite news|title=India's Boom Bypasses Rural Poor|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date=29 April 2011|author=Tom Wright and Harsh Gupta|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704081604576143671902043578|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170716054442/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704081604576143671902043578|archivedate=16 July 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hospitals and health care===
In Government Hospitals, corruption is associated with non-availability/duplication of medicines, obtaining admission, consultations with doctors and receiving diagnostic services.&lt;ref name="2005-TI-study"/&gt;

[[National Rural Health Mission]] is another health care-related government programme that has been subject to large scale corruption allegations. This social spending and entitlement programme hoped to improve health care delivery across rural India. Managed since 2005 by the [[Ministry of Health and Family Welfare|Ministry of Health]], the Indian government mandated a spending of {{INRConvert|2.77|lc}} in 2004–2005, and increased it annually to be about 1% of India's gross domestic product. The National Rural Health Mission programme has been clouded by a large-scale [[Uttar Pradesh NRHM scam|corruption scandal]] in which high-level government appointed officials were arrested, several of whom died under mysterious circumstances including one in prison. Corruption, waste and fraud-related losses from this government programme has been alleged to be {{INRConvert|1|lc}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Health-scam-Former-CMO-Sachan-booked/Article1-729454.aspx |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130126182057/http://www.hindustantimes.com/Health-scam-Former-CMO-Sachan-booked/Article1-729454.aspx |dead-url=yes |archive-date=26 January 2013 |title=Health scam: Former CMO, Sachan booked |website=Hindustan Times|date=4 August 2011 |accessdate=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pm&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newindianexpress.com/nation/article320874.ece |title=The New Indian Express |publisher=The New Indian Express |accessdate=13 August 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203095732/http://newindianexpress.com/nation/article320874.ece |archivedate=3 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dna&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report_nrhm-scam-6-officials-booked-in-accountant-s-murder_1651513 |title=NRHM scam: 6 officials booked in accountant's murder – India – DNA |publisher=Dnaindia.com |date=17 February 2012 |accessdate=13 August 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121031111334/http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report_nrhm-scam-6-officials-booked-in-accountant-s-murder_1651513 |archivedate=31 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ft072012&gt;{{cite news|title=India to give free medicine to millions|work=The Financial Times|date=5 July 2012|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/d18b2006-c687-11e1-963a-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1zEesnuZu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preferential award of mineral resources===
{{See also|Illegal mining in India}}

In August 2011, an iron ore mining scandal became a media focus in India. In September 2011, elected member of Karnataka's legislative assembly Janardhana Reddy, was arrested on charges of corruption and illegal mining of iron ore in his home state. It was alleged that his company received preferential allotment of resources, organised and exported billions of dollars' worth of iron ore to Chinese companies in recent years without paying any royalty to the state government exchequer of Karnataka or the central government of India, and that these Chinese companies made payment to shell companies registered in Caribbean and north Atlantic tax havens controlled by Reddy.&lt;ref name="The Hindu, Business Line"&gt;{{cite web|title= Dredging out mineral piracy, 7 September 2011|publisher= The Hindu, Business Line|url= http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/editorial/article2430063.ece|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121010055711/http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/editorial/article2430063.ece|archivedate= 10 October 2012|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thehindu.com"&gt;{{cite news|title = Full Report of Karnataka Lokayukta on Illegal Mining of Iron Ore, 27 July 2011|publisher = The Hindu, Business Line|url = http://www.thehindu.com/multimedia/archive/00736/Report_on_the_refer_736286a.pdf|location = Chennai, India|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121026100525/http://www.thehindu.com/multimedia/archive/00736/Report_on_the_refer_736286a.pdf|archivedate = 26 October 2012|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also alleged that corrupt government officials cooperated with Reddy, starting from government officials in charge of regulating mining to government officials in charge of regulating port facilities and shipping. These officials received monthly bribes in exchange for enabling the illegal export of illegally mined iron ore to China. Such scandals have led to a demand in India for consensually driven action plan to eradicate the piracy of India's mineral resources by an illegal, politically corrupt government officials-business nexus, removal of incentives for illegal mining, and the creation of incentives for legal mining and domestic use of iron ore and steel manufacturing.&lt;ref name="The Hindu, Business Line"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thehindu.com"/&gt;

===Driver licensing===
A study conducted between 2004 and 2005 found that India's driver licensing procedure was a hugely distorted bureaucratic process and allows drivers to be licensed despite their low driving ability through promoting the usage of agents. Individuals with the willingness to pay make a significant payment above the official fee and most of these extra payments are made to agents, who act as an intermediary between bureaucrats and applicants.&lt;ref name="Bertrand 2007"&gt;Bertrand, Marianne et al. Obtaining a Driver's License in India: An Experimental Approach to Studying Corruption, The Quarterly Journal of Economics (Nov 2007, No. 122,4)&lt;/ref&gt;

The average licensee paid Rs 1,080, approximately 2.5 times the official fee of Rs 450, in order to obtain a license. On average, those who hired agents had a lower driving ability, with agents helping unqualified drivers obtain licenses and bypass the legally required driving examination. Among the surveyed individuals, approximately 60% of the license holders did not even take the licensing exam and 54% of those license holders failed an independent driving test.&lt;ref&gt;Corruption in Driver licensing Process in Delhi {{cite web|url=http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/mullainathan/files/Corruption.in.Driving.Licensing.Process.in.Delhi.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307101937/http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/mullainathan/files/Corruption.in.Driving.Licensing.Process.in.Delhi.pdf |archivedate=7 March 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agents are the channels of corruption in this bureaucratic driver licensing system, facilitating access to licenses among those who are unqualified to drive. Some of the failures of this licensing system are caused by corrupt bureaucrats who collaborate with agents by creating additional barriers within the system against those who did not hire agents.&lt;ref name="Bertrand 2007"/&gt;

===Trends===
Professor [[Bibek Debroy]] and Laveesh Bhandari claim in their book ''Corruption in India: The DNA and RNA'' that public officials in India may be cornering as much as {{INRConvert|921|b}}, or 1.26 per cent of the GDP through corruption.&lt;ref name="How much do the corrupt earn"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/articles/2016-04-07/india-could-be-sitting-on-a-gold-mine-and-not-know-it |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160408224834/http://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/articles/2016-04-07/india-could-be-sitting-on-a-gold-mine-and-not-know-it |dead-url=yes |archive-date=8 April 2016 |title=How much do the corrupt earn? |work=The Economic Times |date=11 September 2011 |accessdate=11 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book claims most bribery is in government delivered services and the transport and real estate industries.

Bribery and corruption are pervasive, but some areas tend to more issues than others. A 2013 [[Ernst &amp; Young|EY]] (Ernst &amp; Young) Study&lt;ref name="ey.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ey.com/IN/en/Services/Assurance/Fraud-Investigation---Dispute-Services/Bribery-and-corruption-ground-reality-in-India|title=Bribery and corruption: ground reality in India|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823035504/http://www.ey.com/IN/en/Services/Assurance/Fraud-Investigation---Dispute-Services/Bribery-and-corruption-ground-reality-in-India|archivedate=23 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; reports the industries perceived to be the most vulnerable to corruption as: Infrastructure &amp; Real Estate, Metals &amp; Mining, Aerospace &amp; Defense, and Power &amp; Utilities. There are a range of specific factors that make a sector more susceptible to bribery and corruption risks than others. High use of middlemen, large value contracts, and liasioning activities etc. drive the depth, volume and frequency of corrupt practices in vulnerable sectors.

A 2011 KPMG study reports India's real estate, telecommunications and government-run social development projects as the three top sectors plagued by corruption. The study found India's defence, the information technology industry and energy sectors to be the most competitive and least corruption prone sectors.&lt;ref name=kpmg2011/&gt;

CMS India claims in its 2010 India Corruption Study report that socio-economically weaker sections of Indian society are the most adversely affected by government corruption. These include the rural and urban poor, although the study claims that nationwide perception of corruption has decreased between 2005 and 2010. Over the 5-year period, a significantly greater number of people surveyed from the middle and poorest classes in all parts of India claimed government corruption had dropped over time, and that they had fewer direct experiences with bribery demands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=India Corruption Study 2010 |author=Roy and Narayan |publisher=CMS Transparency |year=2011 |url=http://www.cmsindia.org/India%20Corruption%20Study%202010.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111216170147/http://www.cmsindia.org/India%20Corruption%20Study%202010.pdf |archivedate=16 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas in reality corruption has increased ten folds since 2010 and continues to grow relentlessly on a daily basis.

==Black money==
{{Main|Indian black money}}
Black money refers to money that is not fully or legitimately the property of the 'owner'. A [[White paper|government white paper]] on black money in India suggests two possible sources of black money in India;&lt;ref name=fm2012&gt;{{cite web|title=White Paper on Black Money|publisher=Ministry of Finance, Government of India|year=2012|url=http://finmin.nic.in/reports/WhitePaper_BackMoney2012.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729033758/http://finmin.nic.in/reports/WhitePaper_BackMoney2012.pdf|archivedate=29 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first includes activities not permitted by the law, such as crime, drug trade, terrorism and corruption, all of which are illegal in India and secondly, wealth that may have been generated through lawful activity but accumulated by failure to declare income and pay taxes. Some of this black money ends up in illicit financial flows across international borders, such as deposits in tax haven countries.

A November 2010 report from the [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]-based Global Financial Integrity estimates that over a 60-year period, India lost US$213 billion in [[illicit financial flows]] beginning in 1948; adjusted for inflation, this is estimated to be $462 billion in 2010, or about $8 billion per year ($7 per capita per year). The report also estimated the size of India's underground economy at approximately US$640 billion at the end of 2008 or roughly 50% of the nation's GDP.&lt;ref name=dkar&gt;{{cite book|last=Kar|first=Dev|title=The Drivers and Dynamics of Illicit Financial Flows from India: 1948–2008|year=2010|publisher=Global Financial Integrity|location=Washington, DC|url=http://www.gfintegrity.org/storage/gfip/documents/reports/india/gfi_india.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019025920/http://www.gfintegrity.org/storage/gfip/documents/reports/india/gfi_india.pdf|archivedate=19 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another report said that Indian-owned Swiss bank account assets are worth 13 times the country's national debt. These allegations have been denied by [[Swiss Bankers Association]]. James Nason of Swiss Bankers Association in an interview about alleged black money from India, holds that "The (black money) figures were rapidly picked up in the Indian media and in Indian opposition circles, and circulated as gospel truth. However, this story was a complete fabrication. The Swiss Bankers Association never published such a report. Anyone claiming to have such figures (for India) should be forced to identify their source and explain the methodology used to produce them."&lt;ref name=swissinfo&gt;{{cite news|title=Banking secrecy spices up Indian elections|publisher=SWISSINFO – A member of Swiss Broadcasting Corporation|date=14 May 2009|url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/politics/foreign_affairs/Banking_secrecy_spices_up_Indian_elections.html?cid=7396340|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926182809/http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/politics/foreign_affairs/Banking_secrecy_spices_up_Indian_elections.html?cid=7396340|archivedate=26 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=No 'black money' statistics exist: Swiss banks|work=The Times of India|date=13 September 2009|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-09-13/india/28092452_1_james-nason-swiss-bankers-association-sba-s-head}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a separate study, Dev Kar of Global Financial Integrity concludes, "Media reports circulating in India that Indian nationals held around US$1.4 trillion in illicit external assets are widely off the mark compared to the estimates found by his study." Kar claims the amounts are significantly smaller, only about 1.5% of India's GDP on average per annum basis, between 1948 and 2008. This includes corruption, bribery and kickbacks, criminal activities, trade mispricing and efforts to shelter wealth by Indians from India's tax authorities.&lt;ref name=dkar/&gt;

According to a third report, published in May 2012, Swiss National Bank estimates that the total amount of deposits in all Swiss banks, at the end of 2010, by citizens of India were CHF 1.95 billion ({{INRConvert|92.95|b}}). The Swiss Ministry of External Affairs has confirmed these figures upon request for information by the Indian Ministry of External Affairs. This amount is about 700-fold less than the alleged $1.4 trillion in some media reports.&lt;ref name=fm2012/&gt; The report also provided a comparison of the deposits held by Indians and by citizens of other nations in Swiss banks. Total deposits held by citizens of India constitute only 0.13 per cent of the total bank deposits of citizens of all countries. Further, the share of Indians in the total bank deposits of citizens of all countries in Swiss banks has reduced from 0.29 per cent in 2006 to 0.13 per cent in 2010.

Indian companies are reportedly misusing [[public trust]]s for money laundering. India has no centralised repository—like the registrar of companies for corporates—of information on public trusts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/how-indian-companies-are-misusing-public-trusts-to-launder-their-csr-spending/articleshow/49474584.cms | title=How Indian companies are misusing public trusts to launder money | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151024192716/http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/how-indian-companies-are-misusing-public-trusts-to-launder-their-csr-spending/articleshow/49474584.cms | archivedate=24 October 2015 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Railway bookings

As soon as the demonetisation was announced, it was observed by the [[Indian Railways]] authorities that a large number of people started booking tickets particularly in [[Indian Railways coaching stock|classes]] 1A and 2A for the longest distance possible, to get rid of unaccounted for cash. A senior official said, "On November 13, 42.7&amp;nbsp;million passengers were nationally booked across all classes. Of these, only 1,209 were 1A and 16,999 for 2A. It is a sharp dip from the number of passengers booked on November 9, when 27,237 passengers had booked tickets in 1A and 69,950 in 2A."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The [[Ministry of Railways (India)|Railways Ministry]] and the Railway Board responded swiftly and decided that cancellation and refund of tickets of value ₹10,000 and above will not be allowed by any means involving cash. The payment can only be through cheque/electronic payment. Tickets above ₹10,000 can be refunded by filing ticket deposit receipt only on surrendering the original ticket. A copy of the [[PAN card]] must be submitted for any cash transaction above ₹50,000. The railway claimed that since the Railway Board on 10 November imposed a number of restrictions to book and cancel tickets, the number of people booking 1A and 2A tickets came down.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|title=Rlys sets 5000 as cash refund limit for tickets|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Rlys-sets-5000-as-cash-refund-limit-for-tickets/articleshow/55444673.cms|accessdate=15 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113153223/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Rlys-sets-5000-as-cash-refund-limit-for-tickets/articleshow/55444673.cms|archivedate=13 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Railways say, no cash refund for tickets booked between Nov 9-11|url=http://zeenews.india.com/economy/railways-say-no-cash-refund-for-tickets-booked-between-nov-9-11_1949831.html|accessdate=15 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161116022144/http://zeenews.india.com/economy/railways-say-no-cash-refund-for-tickets-booked-between-nov-9-11_1949831.html|archivedate=16 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Municipal and local tax payments

As the use of the demonetised notes had been allowed by the government for the payment of municipal and local body taxes, leading to people using the demonetised ₹500 and ₹1,000 notes to pay large amounts of outstanding and advance taxes. As a result, revenue collections of the local civic bodies jumped. The [[Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation]] reported collecting about {{INRConvert|1.6|b}} in cash payments of outstanding and advance taxes within 4 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/hyderabad/demonetisation-impact-greater-hyderabad-municipal-corporation-collects-over-rs-160-crore-in-just-four-days_1949989.html|title=Demonetisation impact: Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation collects over Rs 160 crore in just four days|date=15 November 2016|publisher=india.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201095324/http://zeenews.india.com/news/hyderabad/demonetisation-impact-greater-hyderabad-municipal-corporation-collects-over-rs-160-crore-in-just-four-days_1949989.html|archivedate=1 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business and corruption==
Public servants have very wide discretionary powers offering the opportunity to extort undue payments from companies and ordinary citizens. The awarding of public contracts is notoriously corrupt, especially at the state level. Scandals involving high-level politicians have highlighted the payment of kickbacks in the healthcare, IT and military sectors. The deterioration of the overall efficiency of the government, protection of property rights, ethics and corruption as well as undue influence on government and judicial decisions has resulted in a more difficult business environment.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Judiciary==
According to [[Transparency International]]{{Unreliable source?|date=May 2013}}, [[Judicial corruption]] in India is attributable to factors such as "delays in the disposal of cases, shortage of judges and complex procedures, all of which are exacerbated by a preponderance of new laws".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=37972|title=INDIA: Legal System in the Dock|author=Praful Bidwai|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307114424/http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=37972|archivedate=7 March 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years there have been numerous allegations against judges, and in 2011 [[Soumitra Sen]], a former judge at the [[Kolkata High Court]] became the first judge in India to be impeached by the [[Rajya Sabha]], (Upper House of the Indian Parliament) for misappropriation of funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Judiciary stares at morality crisis|publisher=India Today|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/law-intern-sexual-harrassement-judiciary-stares-at-morality-crisis/1/335731.html|date=12 January 2014|accessdate=2014-04-17|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140418220645/http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/law-intern-sexual-harrassement-judiciary-stares-at-morality-crisis/1/335731.html|archivedate=18 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anti-corruption efforts==

===Right to Information Act===
{{Main|Right to Information Act}}
The 2005 [[Right to Information Act]] required government officials to provide information requested by citizens or face punitive action, as well as the computerisation of services and the establishment of vigilance commissions. This considerably reduced corruption and opened up avenues to redress grievances.&lt;ref name="2005-TI-study"/&gt;

===Right to public services legislation===
{{Main|Right to Public Services legislation}}
Right to Public Services legislation, which has been enacted in 19 states of India, guarantee time bound delivery of services for various [[public services]] rendered by the government to citizen and provides mechanisms for punishing the errant [[public servant]] who is deficient in providing the service stipulated under the statute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Punjab clears Right to Services Act|url=http://www.hindu.com/2011/06/08/stories/2011060868130500.htm|work=8 June 2011|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=4 December 2011|location=Chennai, India|date=8 June 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110828064109/http://www.hindu.com/2011/06/08/stories/2011060868130500.htm|archivedate=28 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Right to Service legislation is meant to reduce corruption among the government officials and to increase transparency and public accountability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Corruption watchdog hails Bihar, MP govts as best service-providers|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-04-21/india/29458398_1_passport-office-transparency-international-guidelines|publisher=Times of India|accessdate=4 December 2011|date=21 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-corruption laws in India===
Public servants in India can be imprisoned for several years and penalised for corruption under the:
* [[Indian Penal Code|Indian Penal Code, 1860]]
* [[Prosecution section of Income Tax Act, 1961]]
* [[Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988|The Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988]]
* The [[Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act, 1988]] to prohibit benami transactions.
* [[Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002]]

Punishment for bribery in India can range from six months to seven years.

At present there are no legal provisions to check graft in the private sector in India. Government has proposed amendments in existing acts and certain new bills for checking corruption in private sector. Big-ticket corruption is mainly witnessed in the operations of large commercial or corporate entities. In order to prevent bribery on supply side, it is proposed that key managerial personnel of companies' and also the company shall be held liable for offering bribes to gain undue benefits.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

The Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 provides that the properties of corrupt public servants shall be confiscated. However, the Government is considering incorporating provisions for confiscation or forfeiture of the property of corrupt public servants into the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 to make it more self-contained and comprehensive.&lt;ref name="ey.com"/&gt;

A committee headed by the Chairman of Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), has been constituted to examine ways to strengthen laws to curb generation of black money in India, its illegal transfer abroad, and its recovery. "The Committee shall examine the existing legal and administrative framework to deal with the menace of generation of black money through illegal means including inter-alia the following: 1. Declaring wealth generated illegally as national asset; 2. Enacting/amending laws to confiscate and recover such assets; and 3. Providing for exemplary punishment against its perpetrators."

===Civic anti-corruption organisations===
A variety of organisations have been created in India to actively fight against corrupt government and business practices. Notable organisations include:
* [Bharat Swabhiman Trust], established by [[Ramdev]], has campaigned against black money and corruption for a decade.{{when|date=December 2014}}
* [[5th Pillar]] is most known for the creation of the [[zero rupee note]], a valueless note designed to be given to corrupt officials when they request bribes.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}
* [[India Against Corruption]] was a popular movement active during 2011–12 that received much media attention. Among its prominent public faces were [[Arvind Kejriwal]], [[Kiran Bedi]] and [[Anna Hazare]]. Kejriwal went on to form the [[Aam Aadmi Party]] and Hazare established [[Jan Tantra Morcha]].&lt;ref name="express"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/article376075.ece|title=Wasn’t easy for Anna's ‘thambis’|last=G Babu Jayakumar|date=10 April 2011|work=The New Indian Express|location=India|language=en-IN|accessdate=12 May 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203084419/http://newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/article376075.ece|archivedate=3 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of ideas have been in discussion to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of electoral processes in India.

==Factors contributing to corruption in India==
In a 2004 report on Corruption in India,&lt;ref name=kpmg2011&gt;{{cite web|title=Survey on Bribery and Corruption – Impact on Economy and Business Environment|publisher=KPMG|year=2011|url=http://www.kpmg.com/IN/en/IssuesAndInsights/ThoughtLeadership/KPMG_Bribery_Survey_Report_new.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108141829/http://www.kpmg.com/IN/en/IssuesAndInsights/ThoughtLeadership/KPMG_Bribery_Survey_Report_new.pdf|archivedate=8 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the world's largest audit and compliance firms [[KPMG]] notes several issues that encourage corruption in India. The report suggests high taxes and excessive regulation bureaucracy as a major cause; India has high marginal tax rates and numerous regulatory bodies with the power to stop any citizen or business from going about their daily affairs.&lt;ref name=kpmg2011/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Economist"&gt;{{cite news|title=Corruption in India – A rotten state|work=The Economist|date=10 March 2011|url=http://www.economist.com/node/18332796|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120818134512/http://www.economist.com/node/18332796|archivedate=18 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This power of Indian authorities to search and question individuals creates opportunities for corrupt public officials to extract bribes—each individual or business decides if the effort required for due process and the cost of delay is worth paying the bribe demanded. In cases of high taxes, paying off the corrupt official is cheaper than the tax. This, according to the report, is one major cause of corruption in India and 150 other countries across the world. In the real estate industry, the high capital gains tax in India encourages large-scale corruption. The KPMG report claims that the correlation between high real estate taxes and corruption is high in India as it is other countries including the developed economies; this correlation has been true in modern times as well as throughout centuries of human history in various cultures.&lt;ref name=kpmg2011/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Economist"/&gt;

The desire to pay lower taxes than those demanded by the state explains the demand side of corruption. The net result is that the corrupt officials collect bribes, the government fails to collect taxes for its own budget, and corruption grows. The report suggests regulatory reforms, process simplification and lower taxes as means to increase tax receipts and reduce causes of corruption.&lt;ref name=kpmg2011/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Economist"/&gt;

In addition to tax rates and regulatory burdens, the KPMG report claims corruption results from opaque process and paperwork on the part of the government. Lack of transparency allows room for manoeuvre for both demanders and suppliers of corruption. Whenever objective standards and transparent processes are missing, and subjective opinion driven regulators and opaque/hidden processes are present, conditions are ripe for corruption.&lt;ref name=kpmg2011/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=CORRUPTION: CAUSES, CONSEQUENCES AND CURES |author=U Myint |journal=Asia-Pacific Development Journal |volume=7 |number=2 |date=December 2000 |url=http://www.unescap.org/DRPAD/publication/journal_7_2/myint.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027095628/http://www.unescap.org/drpad/publication/journal_7_2/myint.pdf |archivedate=27 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vito Tanzi in an [[International Monetary Fund]] study suggests that in India, like other countries in the world, corruption is caused by excessive regulations and authorisation requirements, complicated taxes and licensing systems, mandated spending programmes, lack of competitive free markets, monopoly of certain goods and service providers by government controlled institutions, bureaucracy, lack of penalties for corruption of public officials, and lack of transparent laws and processes.&lt;ref name=WFR2011&gt;{{cite web|title=Corruption in India|publisher=The World Finance Review|author=Debroy and Bhandari|year=2011|url=http://www.worldfinancialreview.com/?p=1575|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130209132023/http://www.worldfinancialreview.com/?p=1575|archivedate=9 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Corruption Around the World – Causes, Consequences, Scope, and Cures|author=Vito Tanzi|publisher=IMF Staff Papers|volume=45|number=4|date=December 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Harvard University study finds these to be some of the causes of corruption and underground economy in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Role of Law and Legal Institutions in Asian Economic Development: The Case of India|author=Anant and Mitra|publisher=Harvard University|date=November 1998|url=http://www.cid.harvard.edu/hiid/662.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160429191844/http://www.cid.harvard.edu/hiid/662.pdf|archivedate=29 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact of corruption==

===Loss of credibility===
In a study on Bribery and Corruption in India conducted in 2013&lt;ref name="ey.com"/&gt; by global professional services firm [[Ernst &amp; Young]] (EY), a majority of the survey respondents from PE firms said that a company operating in a sector which is perceived as highly corrupt may lose ground when it comes to fair valuation of its business, as investors bargain hard and factor in the cost of corruption at the time of transaction.

According to a report by [[KPMG]], "high-level corruption and scams are now threatening to derail the country's its credibility and [its] economic boom".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Colvin|first=Geoff|title=Corruption: The biggest threat to developing economies|url=http://money.cnn.com/2011/04/19/news/international/corruption_developing_economies.fortune/?section=money_latest|publisher=CNNMoney|accessdate=23 May 2011|date=20 April 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430083130/http://money.cnn.com/2011/04/19/news/international/corruption_developing_economies.fortune/?section=money_latest|archivedate=30 April 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic loss===
Corruption may lead to further bureaucratic delay and inefficiency if corrupted bureaucrats introduce red tape in order to extort more bribes.&lt;ref&gt;Myrdal, Gunnar. Asian Drama: An Enquiry in the Poverty of Nations, The Australian Quarterly (Dec 1968, Vol. 40, 4)&lt;/ref&gt; Such inadequacies in institutional efficiency could affect growth indirectly by lowering the private [[marginal product]] of capital and investment rate.&lt;ref name="Mauro, Paolo 1995"&gt;Mauro, Paolo. Corruption and Growth, The Quarterly Journal of Economics (Aug 1995, Vol. 110, 3)&lt;/ref&gt; Levine and Renelt showed that investment rate is a robust determinant of economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Ross. Renalt, David. A Sensitivity Analysis of Cross-Country Growth Regressions, Th American Economic Review (Sep 1992, Vol. 8, 4)&lt;/ref&gt;

Bureaucratic inefficiency also affects growth directly through misallocation of investments in the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1993/11/01/000009265_3961005131850/Rendered/PDF/multi0page.pdf |title=How Much do Distortions Affect Growth |publisher=[[World Bank]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605154519/http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1993/11/01/000009265_3961005131850/Rendered/PDF/multi0page.pdf |archivedate=5 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, corruption results in lower economic growth for a given level of income.&lt;ref name="Mauro, Paolo 1995"/&gt;

===Lower corruption, higher growth rates===
If corruption levels in India were reduced to levels in developed economies such as Singapore or the United Kingdom, India's GDP growth rate could increase at a higher rate annually. [[C. K. Prahalad]] estimates the lost opportunity caused by corruption in terms of investment, growth and jobs for India is over US$50 billion a year.&lt;ref name=tfe2010&gt;{{cite news|title=The trillion-dollar question|date=19 December 2010|author=Nirvikar Singh|publisher=The Financial Express|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/news/the-trilliondollar-question/726482/0|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121129081114/http://www.financialexpress.com/news/the-trilliondollar-question/726482/0|archivedate=29 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Constituent Assembly of Tunisia|National Constituent Assembly]] developed an anti-corruption initiative in December 2012 which aims to establish a national integrity system, to promote the independent National Anti-Corruption Authority, and to boost civil society participation in corruption prevention. However, the government's effort is still considered limited. Corruption is still a serious problem yet it is less pervasive when compared to the neighboring countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Transformation Index 2012-Tunisia|url=http://www.bti-project.org/reports/country-reports/mena/tun/2012/index.nc|publisher=The Bertelsmann Foundation 2012|accessdate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of middlemen is very important for doing business in Tunisia, and many investors consider that having the right connections when collaborating on business in order to overcome administrative hurdles to investment and public procurement is crucial. State-owned companies or private groups owned by influential families continue to enjoy a privileged position, with close political and administrative ties and easier access to financing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tunisia Corruption Profile|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/middle-east-north-africa/tunisia/show-all.aspx|publisher=Business Anti-Corruption Portal|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''culture of life''' describes a [[culture|way of life]] based upon the belief that human life at all stages from [[Human fertilization|conception]] through [[natural death]] is sacred.  As such, a culture of life opposes practices destructive to human life at any stage, including [[abortion]], [[euthanasia]], studies and medicines involving [[embryonic stem cells]], and [[contraception]].  It also promotes policies that "lift up the human spirit with compassion and love."&lt;ref name=leonard/&gt;  The term originated in [[moral theology]], especially [[Catholic moral theology|that of the Catholic Church]], and gained popularity after it was used by [[Pope John Paul II]].

In the United States, [[politics of the United States|politicians]] such as [[George W. Bush]] have used the phrase.&lt;ref name=pew/&gt;&lt;ref name=leonard/&gt;  In 2004, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] included a plank in their platform that called for "Promoting a Culture of Life."&lt;ref name=platform/&gt;

The expression "culture of life" entered popular parlance from [[Pope John Paul II]] in the 1990s.&lt;ref name= Grondelski/&gt;  He used the term in his 1991 encyclical ''[[Centesimus annus]]'', and then more fully expanded upon it in the 1995 [[encyclical]] ''[[Evangelium vitae]]'' ("Gospel of Life"):

{{quote|In our present social context, marked by a dramatic struggle between the "culture of life" and the "culture of death", there is need to develop a deep critical sense, capable of discerning true values and authentic needs.&lt;ref name=ev/&gt;}}

In the encyclical, the pope noted that even those who were not Catholic "can appreciate the intrinsic value of human life."&lt;ref name=build/&gt;  He also issued "a pressing appeal addressed to each and every person, in the name of God: Respect, protect, love, and serve life, every human life! Only in this direction will you find justice, development, true freedom, peace and happiness!"&lt;ref name=build/&gt;{{sfn|Evangelium vitae|p=5}} 

John Paul linked this to Catholic teaching, where every person is said to have been created in the [[Image of God| image and likeness of God]] and, as such, is intimately loved by God.{{sfn|Evangelium vitae|p=2}}&lt;ref name=hobart/&gt;  The Church, then, must build a culture of life that values each person as a person, and not for what they own, do, or produce.{{sfn|Evangelium vitae|p=23}}&lt;ref name=hobart/&gt;  It must also protect every human life, especially those that are threatened or weak.{{sfn|Evangelium vitae|p=77}}&lt;ref name=hobart/&gt; It had foundations in earlier church teaching such as [[Pope Paul VI]]'s 1968 encyclical ''[[Humanae vitae]]'',&lt;ref name=hv/&gt; where the Church articulated its position on the defense of life from conception to natural death; therefore disapproving of certain medical procedures that may harm or kill an unborn fetus, which the Church holds to be a person with an inviolable [[right to life]]. Catholic hospitals and medical institutions will not perform such procedures.{{fact|date=September 2018}} 

Following the promulgation of ''[[Evangelium vitae]]'', advocates of a culture of life founded the [[Culture of Life Foundation]] in the United States to promote the concepts behind the Pope's encyclical.&lt;ref name=foundation/&gt; Pope John Paul II recognized and [[blessing|blessed]] the foundation in 1997.&lt;ref name=fox/&gt;&lt;ref name=foundation/&gt;  In 2005, 68% of White [[Evangelicalism|evangelical Protestants]] in the United States opposed abortion, 58% opposed euthanasia and 15% opposed the death penalty.&lt;ref name=pew05/&gt;

==United States politics==
[[Image:PBAsigning.jpg|thumb|250px|George W. Bush signing the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act]] of 2003, surrounded by members of Congress]]

[[Evangelium vitae]] has been described as the Catholic academic Christopher Kaczor as the "[[magna carta]] for the [[pro-life movement]]."&lt;ref name=build/&gt;

On October 3, 2000, during the [[US presidential election, 2000|U.S. presidential election]] campaign, then-Texas Governor [[George W. Bush]], a Methodist, cited the term during a televised debate against then [[United States Vice President|Vice President]] [[Al Gore]].  Bush expressed concerns that [[Mifepristone]], then newly approved as an abortifacient pill, would encourage more women to terminate their pregnancies; whereas his goal was to make such terminations rarer and instead to "promote a culture of life."  Bush said:

{{quote|Surely this nation can come together to promote the value of life. Surely we can fight off these laws that will encourage doctors or allow doctors to take the lives of our seniors. Sure, we can work together to create a culture of life so some of these youngsters who feel like they can take a neighbor's life with a gun will understand that that's not the way America is meant to be.&lt;ref name=debates/&gt;}}

Leonard Mary of the [[The Boston Globe|''Boston Globe'']] said that Bush had directly borrowed his language from John Paul II, viewing this as a deliberate strategic attempt to gain political support from "moderate" Catholics voters (while not coming out so strongly against abortion rights that it would alienate [[pro-choice]] voters).&lt;ref name=build/&gt;&lt;ref name=leonard/&gt;  Voters believed that only the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] would build a culture of life in the Unites States, and this helped propel Bush to victory.{{sfn|Day|2006|p=386}}

Some Catholics,{{Who|date=December 2018}} however, criticized Bush for apparent inconsistency between his support of a culture of life and his strong support for the death penalty, which Catholic doctrine permits where there is no other means for society to protect itself. As [[Governor of Texas]], Bush repeatedly authorized executions of convicted murderers. 

Kristen Day, the executive director of [[Democrats for Life of America]] says that "achieving a culture of life cannot be done by simply voting Republican."  Day says that "to be truly pro-life, we must support a broad spectrum of issues including worker's compensation, minimum wage, and education assistance for displaced workers,"{{sfn|Day|2006|p=385}} as well as addressing poverty, including a livable wage and health care.{{sfn|Day|2006|p=395}}  Day says that Republicans should broaden their definition of a culture of life beyond simple opposition to abortion, and that to achieve a true culture of life that members of both parties will be needed.{{sfn|Day|2006|p=387}}

The 2004 Republican National Convention adopted a platform with a plank titled "Promoting a Culture of Life."&lt;ref name=kirk/&gt;&lt;ref name=platform/&gt;  The platform's pro-life stance included positions on abortion; access to healthcare despite disability, age, or infirmity; euthanasia; assisted suicide; and promoted research and resources to alleviate the pain of the terminally ill.&lt;ref name=platform/&gt;

The phrase "culture of life" was also invoked during the [[Terri Schiavo]] case of March 2005, when the phrase was used in support of legislative and legal efforts to prolong the life of a woman in an alleged [[persistent vegetative state]].&lt;ref name=hanson/&gt;  It has also been used to promote providing inexpensive medical care for people in impoverished countries.&lt;ref name=cafta/&gt;

Following the [[Boston Marathon bombing]], the Catholic bishops of Massachusetts opposed the death penalty for [[Dzhokhar Tsarnaev]], citing the need to build a culture of life.&lt;ref name=conflicted/&gt;  In their statement, they cited a 2005 document by the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]], ''A Culture of Life and the Penalty of Death,'' which said "no matter how heinous the crime, if society can protect itself without ending a human life, it should do so."&lt;ref name=conflicted/&gt;

==Culture of death==

Pope [[John Paul II]] also used the opposing term "culture of death" in ''[[Evangelium vitae]]'' (April 1995):

{{quote|In fact, while the climate of widespread moral uncertainty can in some way be explained by the multiplicity and gravity of today's social problems, and these can sometimes mitigate the subjective responsibility of individuals, it is no less true that we are confronted by an even larger reality, which can be described as a veritable structure of sin. This reality is characterized by the emergence of a culture which denies solidarity and in many cases takes the form of a veritable '&lt;u&gt;culture of death&lt;/u&gt;.' This culture is actively fostered by powerful cultural, economic and political currents which encourage an idea of society excessively concerned with efficiency.{{sfn|Evangelium vitae|p=12}}}}

He argued that there was "a war of the powerful against the weak: a life which would require greater acceptance, love and care is considered useless, or held to be an intolerable burden, and is therefore rejected in one way or another."{{sfn|Evangelium vitae|p=12}}  Those who are ill, handicapped, or just simply threaten the well being or lifestyle of the more powerful thus become enemies to be eliminated.{{sfn|Evangelium vitae|p=12}}  John Paul recognized this both between individuals and between peoples and states.{{sfn|Evangelium vitae|p=12}}

He added his belief that every time an "innocent life" is taken (dating back to the time of [[Cain and Abel]]) that it was "a violation of the ‘spiritual’ kinship uniting mankind in one great family, in which all share the same fundamental good: equal personal dignity."&lt;ref name=build/&gt;{{sfn|Evangelium vitae|pp=7-8}}  Any threat to the human person, including wars, class conflict, civil unrest, ecological recklessness, and sexual irresponsibility, should therefore be regarded in his opinion as part of the "culture of death."&lt;ref name=build/&gt;

Without morals, Cardinal [[Cormac Murphy-O'Connor]] said, "it is the strong who decide the fate of the weak," and "human beings therefore become instruments of other human beings... We are already on that road: for what else is the termination of millions of lives in the womb since the [[Abortion Act 1967|Abortion Act]] was introduced, and embryo selection on the basis of gender and genes?”&lt;ref name=pook/&gt;

===Wider usage===

Advocates of a culture of life argue that a culture of death results in political, economic, or eugenic murder. They point to historical events like the [[USSR]]'s [[Great Purges]], the [[Nazi]] [[Holocaust]], [[China]]'s [[Great Leap Forward]] and [[Pol Pot]]'s [[Khmer Rouge]] as examples of devaluation of human life taken to an extreme conclusion. The term is used by those in the pro-life movement to refer to supporters of embryonic stem cell research, legalized abortion, and euthanasia.&lt;ref name=Dennehy/&gt;&lt;ref name=Blanke/&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt;&lt;ref name=watson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pasquini/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dietrich/&gt; Pro-life advocates from the [[Center for Bio-Ethical Reform]] compare their opponents to the perpetrators of the [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[Holocaust]].&lt;ref name=college/&gt; They say that their opponents share the same disregard for human life.&lt;ref name=Dowbiggin/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hartman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Slane/&gt;

'''Danis Tanović''' (born 20 February 1969) is a [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian]] [[film director]] and [[screenwriter]]. Tanović is best known for having directed and written the script for the 2001 Bosnian movie ''[[No Man's Land (2001 film)|No Man's Land]]'' which won him the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]].

==Life and career==
Tanović was born in [[Zenica]] on 20 February 1969. Tanović was raised in [[Sarajevo]], where he also received his primary and secondary education. He also attended the [[University of Sarajevo]] Music Conservatory, where he played the piano.

As a young adult, Tanović decided to study at the [[Academy of Performing Arts in Sarajevo]]. However, due to the [[Siege of Sarajevo]], Tanović was forced to stop his studies in 1992.

Immediately after war broke out, Tanović formed a film crew that followed the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina, going on dangerous missions. The material that Tanović and the film crew produced has since been used in numerous films and news reports about the Siege of Sarajevo and the [[War in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian war]].

In late 1994, Tanović left the film crew he had worked with for over two years. A year later, Tanović decided to resume his studies, this time in [[Brussels]], the capital of [[Belgium]]. In 1997, Tanović completed his studies in Brussels, graduating at the top of his class. During his studies he made several documentary films.

Shortly after, Tanović began his first movie project, entitled ''[[No Man's Land (2001 film)|No Man's Land]]''. He wrote and directed the movie, which was completed in 2001 and premiered at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] that same year. ''No Man's Land'' went on to win the [[Best Screenplay Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Award for Best Screenplay]] (''Prix du scénario'') at Cannes, followed by numerous awards including the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] in 2001, the [[European Film Academy]] Award for Best Screenplay, the [[César Award|César]] for the Best First Feature Film, the [[André Cavens Award]] for Best Film in 2001, and the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] in 2002.

Tanović was a member of the jury at the [[2003 Cannes Film Festival]].

His second feature project was ''[[Hell (2005 film)|L'Enfer]]'', completed in 2005, from the screenplay by the late [[Krzysztof Kieslowski]] and [[Krzysztof Piesiewicz]]. The film marked the second installment in the Polish duo's projected trilogy ''Heaven'' (filmed by [[Tom Tykwer]] in 2002), ''Hell and Purgatory''. Inspired by [[Euripides]]' ''[[Medea (play)|Medea]]'', ''L'Enfer'' explores the lives of three sisters, "each locked in her own unhappiness, nursing a secret flower of misery, the seed for which was planted by their late father with a terrible incident in their girlhood" (from a review by [[Peter Bradshaw]]).&lt;ref name="Bradshaw"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bradshaw|first1=Peter|title=Hell (L'Enfer)|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2006/apr/21/4|accessdate=26 December 2017|work=The Guardian|date=April 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film received mixed reviews.&lt;ref name="Bradshaw"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jutarnji.hr/arhiva/pakao-filmska-ponuda-koju-danis-tanovic-nije-mogao-odbiti/3762978/|title='Pakao': Filmska ponuda koju Danis Tanović nije mogao odbiti|work=jutarnji.hr|date=30 November 2006|accessdate=26 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dawson"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dawson|first1=Tom|title=Hell (L'Enfer) (2006)|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2006/04/12/hell_2006_review.shtml|accessdate=26 December 2017|work=BBC|date=April 12, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090616123513/http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2006/04/12/hell_2006_review.shtml|archivedate=June 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Holden"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Holden|first1=Stephen|title=A Dose of French Film, Civil and Sane|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/10/movies/a-dose-of-french-film-civil-and-sane.html|accessdate=26 December 2017|work=The New York Times|date=March 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tanović announced in March 2008 that he would be founding a political party with his friend, director Dino Mustafić, called [[Our Party (Bosnia and Herzegovina)|Our Party]], which would start contesting elections with the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina municipal elections, 2008|local elections in October 2008]]. He stated his motivations as wanting to bring political change to the country; his announcement was received positively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/features/setimes/features/2008/03/06/feature-03 Oscar-winning director to establish new political party in BiH (SETimes.com)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://soc.kuleuven.be/iieb/docs/2009/26780_Touquet.pdf{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

His 2010 film ''[[Cirkus Columbia]]'' was selected as the Bosnian entry for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[83rd Academy Awards]],&lt;ref name="screendaily Bosnia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.screendaily.com/awards/academy-awards/academy-awards-news/bosnia-selects-cirkus-columbia-bulgaria-submits-eastern-plays-for-oscars/5018574.article |title=Bosnia selects Cirkus Columbia; Bulgaria submits Eastern Plays for Oscars |accessdate=29 September 2010|work=Screendaily}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it didn't make the final shortlist.&lt;ref name="Oscar Shortlist"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oscars.org/press/pressreleases/2011/20110119.html |title=9 Foreign Language Films Continue to Oscar Race |accessdate=19 January 2011|work=oscars.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, he was bestowed with an "honoris causa" doctorate by the [[University of Sarajevo]].
 
His 2013 film ''[[An Episode in the Life of an Iron Picker]]'' premiered in competition at the [[63rd Berlin International Film Festival]]&lt;ref name="Berlin"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/presse/pressemitteilungen/alle/Alle-Detail_16404.html |title=Berlinale Competition 2013: Another Nine Films Confirmed  |accessdate=24 January 2013 |work=berlinale}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it won two prizes: [[Silver Bear for Best Actor]] and the [[Jury Grand Prix]].&lt;ref name="BerlinPrizes"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/das_festival/preise_und_juries/preise_internationale_jury/index.html |title=Prizes of the International Jury |accessdate=16 February 2013 |work=berlinale}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His latest film "[[Death in Sarajevo]]" won [[Jury Grand Prix]] at the [[66th Berlin International Film Festival]]. It has also won FIPRESCI Award for the best film in competition.

Tanović holds joint [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian]] and Belgian citizenship and lives in [[Sarajevo]] with his wife and five children. He lived in [[Paris]] until 2007.

Currently, he works as a professor of film directing at Academy of Performing Arts in Sarajevo.

'''Danish Crown Regalia''' are the symbols of the [[Danish monarchy]]. They consist of three crowns, a [[Sceptre]] (symbolizing supreme authority), [[Globus cruciger]] (an orb symbolizing the earthly realm surmounted by a cross),  the Sword of state and an [[Ampulla]] (symbolizing anointing of monarchs).
The [[Denmark|Danish]] [[Royal Regalia]] are kept in the treasury at [[Rosenborg Castle]]. The oldest of these is [[Christian III of Denmark|Christian III]]'s sword of state from 1551. They further include King [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]]'s diamond; pearl- and gold-embroidered saddles; objects carved from ivory and rock-crystal; lapidary pieces of precious stones, and [[brooch]]es in the form of fantastic animals.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=   http://www.kongernessamling.dk/rosenborg/danmarks-konger-og-herskersymboler/|title=  Danmarks kongekroner og herskersymboler
|publisher =Rosenborg |accessdate= September 1,  2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the time of the [[elective monarchy|elective monarchs]], the clergy and nobility placed the crown on the king's head at the coronation ceremony.
After the introduction of absolutism in 1660, the crowning of the king was replaced by [[anointment]], for which the king arrived in the church wearing the crown and was consecrated to his calling by being anointed with oil. For the anointing of [[Christian V]], a new crown was made along with the [[Throne Chair of Denmark]] of [[narwhal]] teeth (supposedly the mythical [[unicorn]]'s horn) and three silver lions, the latter created by [[Ferdinand Küblich]] (1664-1687). This was inspired by the biblical description of [[Solomon#Throne|King Solomon's throne]], which was said to be composed of unicorn's horn and gold and guarded by twelve golden lions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=     https://www.kulturarv.dk/kid/VisWeilbach.do?kunstnerId=8098&amp;wsektion=alle|title= Ferdinand Küblich
|publisher =  Weilbachs Kunstnerleksikon|accessdate= September 1,  2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the 1849 Constitution, anointing was discontinued and since then the regalia have only been used on the occasion of a deceased monarch's ''[[Castrum doloris]]'' ('camp of woe') where the crown is placed on the coffin, the other regalia laid at casket's foot, and the casket surrounded by the three lions. The lions were formerly also displayed in [[Rigsdagen|Parliament]] during the annual opening session, but this tradition was discontinued almost 100 years ago.  They were also displayed before the throne in the throne room of [[Christiansborg Palace]] when the Danish kings granted audiences on particularly formal occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Such as when in 1905 [[Christian IX of Denmark|Christian IX]] accepted on behalf of his grandson, [[Haakon VII of Norway|Carl]], the Norwegian parliament's offer of the throne of Norway.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''crown jewels'' refer to four sets ([[parure]]s) of jewellery owned by the state for an incumbent queen and is still worn by the  [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Queen of Denmark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Crown Jewels - The Royal Danish Collection|url=http://www.kongernessamling.dk/en/rosenborg/kronjuvelerne/|website=The Royal Danish Collection}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The royal regalia, which symbolised the [[monarch]]'s authority to rule, includes the crown of King Christian IV, which is a fine example of Renaissance guildwork, the better known crown of King Christian V and a smaller crown for the king's consort. The Royal Collection has other important items and jewels, as well as precious prayer-books, and items belonging to the [[Order of the Elephant]] and the [[Order of the Dannebrog]] (such as the large diamond and pearl star of the Order of the Elephant worn on the coronation mantle).

==The old regalia==

The term ''old regalia'' is used to describe the crown regalia used prior to the introduction of absolute monarchy in 1660.

===The crown of Christian IV===
[[Image:Crown_of_King_Christian_IV_of_Denmark.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The Crown of King [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]]]] 
The crown was fashioned by [[Dirich Fyring]]  (1580-1603) at [[Odense]] assisted by the [[Nuremberg]] goldsmith [[Corvinianus Saur]] during the years 1595-1596 for the coronation of [[Christian IV]]. It is made of gold, enamel, table cut gemstones and pearls and weighs 2895 g.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.kongernessamling.dk/rosenborg/person/dirich-fyring/|title= Dirich Fyring|publisher =  kongernessamling.dk |accessdate= September 1,  2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=     https://www.kulturarv.dk/kid/VisKunstner.do?kunstnerId=6732|title=   Dirich Fyring|publisher =  Weilbachs Kunstnerleksikon
|accessdate= September 1,  2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=     https://www.kulturarv.dk/kid/VisKunstner.do?kunstnerId=10333|title=  Corvinianus Saur|publisher =  Weilbachs Kunstnerleksikon|accessdate= September 1,  2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The circlet is ornamented with six sets of table cut diamonds between two large round pearls with enameled [[putti]] on either side.  Between each of these sets are star-like ornaments of triangular and square table cut diamonds.  On the upper rim of the circlet are six large and six small [[Arabesque (European art)|arabesque]]-like points.  At the center of each of the larger points is an enameled allegorical figure of one of the king's ruling functions and virtues.  The three points above the king's forehead and behind each of his ears bears a "[[pelican#Symbolism and popular culture|pelican]] in her piety."  The point on the right of the king's forehead bears a  representation of [[courage|Fortitude]] riding a lion, while that on the left bears the image of [[Justice]] as a woman holding a sword and a pair of scales.  The point above the back of the king's neck bears the traditional image of [[charity (virtue)|Charity]] as a mother suckling her child.  On the inside these points are decorated with the coats of arms of various regions of the realm.  The six smaller points each bears a star-like design in triangular and square table diamonds with a large pear shaped pearl at its top.

Originally an open crown, in 1648 it was closed with arches and an orb and cross, but Christian V later removed these again, using the diamonds and gold from them in the making of his own crown.  It was used for the last time at the 1648 coronation of [[Frederick III of Denmark|Frederick III]].

===Christian III's sword of state===

The [[sword of state]] of [[Christian III of Denmark|Christian III]] was made in 1551 by [[Johann Siebe]]. It is made of gilded silver and decorated with enamel and table cut gemstones. Prior to the introduction of absolute monarchy, the sword was the first of the regalia presented to the king.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=     https://www.kulturarv.dk/kid/VisKunstner.do?kunstnerId=10525|title=   Johan Siebe|publisher =  Weilbachs Kunstnerleksikon
|accessdate= September 1,  2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christian IV's accolade sword===

The sword was used for [[accolade]]s and has a blue enamel grip decorated with diamonds.

==The new regalia==

===The crown of Christian V===
{{main|Crown of Christian V}}
[[File:Christian v crown.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The crown of Christian V]]This crown is the official crown that was used for the [[Anointing|anointments]] of Danish absolute monarchs until the end of absolutism in 1849. The first Danish absolute monarch [[Frederick III of Denmark|Frederick III]] wanted his son and heir-apparent, the later [[Christian V]], to be in possession of the visible symbols of power at the moment he himself died and his son inherited the title. Therefore, he secretly commissioned several crown regalia, including a crown, to surround the anointing of the absolute monarchs with as much glory as possible.

The crown was first used for the coronation of [[Christian V]] and the last time for the coronation of [[Christian VIII]] in 1840. Today the crown is used as a symbol of the monarchy and the state. Its only ceremonial use is when it is placed on the Castrum doloris of a deceased monarch.

The crown is the visible sign of royal power and was made by the royal goldsmith [[Paul Kurtz]] in Copenhagen in the years 1670-1671. As the crown of the first absolute monarch it was made as a closed crown to look different than the open crowns of the elected kings, possibly inspired by the imperial [[crown of Charlemagne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=     https://www.kulturarv.dk/kid/VisKunstner.do?kunstnerId=8096|title=    Paul Kurtz|publisher =  Weilbachs Kunstnerleksikon
|accessdate= September 1,  2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The circlet of the crown is divided in four by two large [[sapphire]]s, a flat one that can be traced back to [[Frederick I of Denmark|Frederick I]] at the forehead of the wearer (presumably a gift to his father, [[Christian I]], from [[Galeazzo Maria Sforza]], the [[List of rulers of Milan|Duke of Milan]] in 1474) and a thicker one at the back of the head and by a [[spinel]] at one side and a [[garnet]] at the other. The four curved segments of the circlet between these stones is decorated with [[volute]]s made of [[Diamond cut|table cut]] diamonds.

On the upper edge of the circlet are eight [[acanthus (ornament)|acanthus]] leaves, four larger and four smaller ones. These acanthus leaves are decorated with diamond-studded ribs. The front acanthus leaf is decorated with a large table cut diamond with Christian V's [[royal cypher]] visible behind it.  Attached to the backs of each of these acanthus leaves by screws are narrow diamond-studded half arches that meet at the top of the crown to support a sky blue-enameled sphere decorated with diamonds and with a diamond-studded cross on top.  On the top of this cross is a [[cabochon]] [[ruby]]. The crown weighs 2080 g.

===The queen's crown===
The queen-consort [[Charlotte Amalie of Hesse-Kassel]] was not crowned and did not wear a crown either because she belonged to the [[reformed church]] and was thus not a member of the [[Church of Denmark]] or because it was thought unnecessary to crown the queen since she had the right to wear any regalia through her marriage with the king.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=   http://www.kongernessamling.dk/rosenborg/object/dronningens-krone/|title=  Dronningens krone|publisher =Rosenborg
|accessdate= September 1,  2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However all the following queens consorts of the absolute monarchs were crowned. [[Louise of Mecklenburg-Güstrow]], the queen of king [[Frederick IV of Denmark|Frederick IV]], was crowned with a queen's crown made for her, which was also used by Frederick IV to crown her successor [[Anna Sophie Reventlow]]. However [[Sophia Magdalen of Brandenburg-Kulmbach]], the queen of king [[Christian VI]], did not want to use the crown worn by her predecessor and had a new crown made by royal jeweler [[Frederik Fabritius]] (1683-1755) in 1731. This crown is made like that of Christian V but only taller and more slender. It is decorated with table cut diamonds that are assumed to come from the 1648 crown of Queen [[Sophie Amalie of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Sophie Amalie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|

|title= Frederik Fabritius|publisher =  Den Store Danske |accessdate= September 1,  2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Sceptre===

The sceptre was made by an unknown Copenhagen goldsmith for the coronation of [[Frederick III of Denmark|Frederick III]] in 1648. It is made of gold and ends in an elongated enameled knob at the bottom decorated with diamond-studded ribs and an enameled lily at the top with a royal crown above it.

===Globus cruciger===

[[Image:Denmark globus cruciger2.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Danish Globus Cruciger]] The Globus cruciger symbolizes Christian world supremacy.{{cn|date=April 2018}} It is a golden globe decorated with a band of enamel and diamonds. On top of this is a half-circle of enamel and diamonds. It is topped by a diamond-studded cross. It was made in [[Hamburg]] for the coronation of [[Frederick III of Denmark|Frederick III]] in 1648.

===Sword of state===

The [[sword of state]] symbolizes the protecting, punishing and judging authority of the king. The sword was originally a wedding present from [[Christian IV]] to the 1643 wedding of [[Frederick III of Denmark|Frederick III]]. It was used for the anointing of all absolute monarchs and probably also for the coronation of [[Frederick III of Denmark|Frederick III]].

Its cross-guard and grip is decorated with gemstones. The scabbard has a diamond-studded [[Chape]], is covered in red velvet and is decorated with the coats of arms of different parts of the realm. Above each coat of arms is a small diamond-studded crown.

===Ampulla===

The [[ampulla]], used to contain the [[anointing oil]], is a gold [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] and its lid enameled with a variety of flowers and studded with table cut diamonds made by an unknown Copenhagen goldsmith for the coronation of [[Frederick III of Denmark|Frederick III]] in 1648.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ampulla - The Royal Danish Collection|url=http://www.kongernessamling.dk/en/rosenborg/object/the-ampulla/|website=The Royal Danish Collection}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Participantes do Enem.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Students taking the exam in [[Brasília]].]]
'''Exame Nacional do Ensino Médio''' ({{IPA-pt|eˈzɐ̃mi nasjoˈnaw du ẽˈsinu [ˈmɛd͡ʒiw, ˈmɛdiw]|br}}) ('''Enem''' {{IPA-pt|eˈnẽj̃|br}}) ({{lang-en|National High School Exam}}) is a non-mandatory, standardized [[Brazil]]ian national exam, which evaluates [[high school]] [[education in Brazil|students in Brazil]].&lt;ref name="inep-sobre"/&gt; The ENEM is the most important exam of its kind in Brazil, with more than 8.6 million registered candidates in 2016. It is the second largest in the world after the [[National Higher Education Entrance Examination]], the entrance examination of higher education in China. &lt;ref name="globo-2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="globo-2016"/&gt;

After 2009 its importance for students who want to attend college has increased, since the exam has been used both as an admission test for enrollment in 23 federal universities and 26 educational institutes, as well as for certification for a high school degree. The test is also used by people desiring to gain points in the [[University for All Program]] (Programa Universidade para Todos, or ProUni), a federal scholarship program.&lt;ref name="inep-sobre"/&gt;

==Date and time==

The ENEM is held in early November, with a small number of students taking the test in early December. The test starts at the same time across Brazil, with the starting time being based in [[Federal District (Brazil)|Federal District]]. This results in the ENEM starting at four different times according to the local time zones, ranging from 10:30 am in the state of [[Acre (state)|Acre]] to 1:30 pm in the Federal District and states of the [[South Region, Brazil|South]] and [[Southeast Region, Brazil|Southeast]] regions.&lt;ref name="globo-2016"/&gt;

== The test ==

Until 2008, the exam consisted of two parts: a 63 question multiple-choice test on various subjects (Portuguese, History, Geography, Math, Physics, Chemistry and Biology) and a composition. 

Since 2009, the exam has been composed of 180 multiple-choice questions, equally divided into four areas of knowledge: languages, codes and related technologies (plus a written essay); human sciences and related technologies; natural sciences and related technologies; and mathematics and its technologies. Due to the length of the test, it is applied in two consecutive sundays, the first lasting 300 minutes, and the second lasting 330.&lt;ref name="inep-faq"/&gt;

Even though its purpose is to be a national evaluation exam, students can use their scores to be admitted to a university, though not every university accepts it as the only admission exam. Usually private institutions, such as [[PUC-Rio]], a major private Brazilian university, accept Enem as an admission exam. Others, such as [[University of São Paulo]] and [[Faculdade Cásper Líbero]] use the student's score as supplement to their admission credentials, depending on the student's performance.

Since 2009, most of Brazil's federal universities have used ENEM as part of their admission exams, either as the entirety of the exam, the first level, or as a way of selecting potential candidates.&lt;ref name="inep-sobre"/&gt;

==2009 controversy==

On October 1, 2009, it was announced that the test, which was supposed to take place on October 3 and 4, would be cancelled and postponed to another date within a 45-day period. The decision was made by the Brazilian Ministry of Education after the original test was offered for sale to a Brazilian newspaper [[O Estado de S. Paulo]] for [[Brazilian real|R$]] 500,000 (some US$ 278,000).&lt;ref name="News at Estadão"/&gt; After contacting the source, who stated that he obtained the test via a person from Inep (an institute of the Ministry of Education),&lt;ref name="News at Estadão"/&gt; the newspaper examined the exam. and the minister of education, [[Fernando Haddad]], confirmed the leak was of the official exam. At that time the Ministry of Education decided to move the exam to the beginning of December, in accordance with exam periods in universities. The decision was not implemented.&lt;ref name="News at Estadão"/&gt;

'''''Femmes-Caïmans''''' was a women's organization in the [[Congo-Brazzaville]], the [[women's wing]] of the [[UDDIA]] party led by [[Fulbert Youlou]]. Youlou had assisted the funding of the organization in 1956.&lt;ref name="amb"&gt;Bernault, Florence. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=mPKpk3bhb3cC Démocraties ambiguës en Afrique centrale: Congo-Brazzaville, Gabon, 1940-1965]''. Paris: Karthala, 1996. p. 328&lt;/ref&gt; The organization was named after the [[cayman (disambiguation)|cayman]], which was the symbol of UDDIA. Pauline Madieta was the president of ''Femmes-Caïmans''.&lt;ref name="bra"&gt;Ziavoula, Robert Edmond.

''Femmes-Caïmans'' were amongst the most active political organizations in [[Brazzaville]] during 1957-1960, and was able to recruit illiterate women.&lt;ref name="bra"/&gt; As of 1960, the organization had around 250 members in Brazzaville.&lt;ref name="amb"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7635">The '''Good Neighbor Council''' was an effort in [[North Carolina]] proposed by Governor [[Terry Sanford]] to fight [[Racial segregation]] and encourage the employment of blacks in the state. [[David S. Coltrane]] was the first chairman and director of the Good Neighbor Council.

==Creation==
On January 18, 1963, Governor Terry Sanford created the Good Neighbor Council to help ease racial tensions that were building in the state because of civil rights struggles and integration issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Luebke|first=Paul|title=Tar Heel Politics: Myths and Realities|year=1990|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill, NC|isbn=0-8078-4271-0|authorlink=Paul Luebke|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The purpose of the councils was two-fold: to encourage the employment of qualified people without regard to race; and to encourage youth to become better trained and qualified for employment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/679822202 North Carolina and the Negro]. 1964. Page 255.&lt;/ref&gt;

Governor Sanford established this council on January 13, 1968, and appointed [[David S. Coltrane]] as the first Chairman and Executive Director. He held this position until his death in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Records of the Human Relations Council, 1963-1977 |url=http://www.archives.ncdcr.gov/findingaids/circulars/aic17.pdf |work=Archives Information Circular |publisher=North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources |accessdate=September 24, 2012 |page=5 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918212510/http://www.archives.ncdcr.gov///FindingAids/Circulars/AIC17.pdf |archivedate=September 18, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=award&gt;{{cite news|last=Wood|first=John|title=State recognizes community service of Wallace doctor, New Hanover agency|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=z0lOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=DRQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3314%2C470413|accessdate=September 24, 2012|newspaper=Wilmington Star-News|date=March 2, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Great Leap Forward''' ({{zh|s=大跃进|p=Dà Yuèjìn}}) of the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) was an economic and social campaign by the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) from 1958 to 1962. The campaign was led by [[Chairman of the Communist Party of China|Chairman]] [[Mao Zedong]] and aimed to rapidly transform the country from an [[agrarian economy]] into a [[Socialist mode of production|socialist society]] through rapid [[industrialization]] and [[collectivization]]. However, it is widely considered to have caused the [[Great Chinese Famine]].

Chief changes in the lives of rural Chinese included the incremental introduction of mandatory [[agricultural collectivization]]. Private farming was prohibited, and those engaged in it were persecuted and labeled [[Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries|counter-revolutionaries]]. Restrictions on rural people were enforced through public [[struggle session]]s and social pressure, although people also experienced forced labor.&lt;ref name=mirsky/&gt; Rural industrialization, officially a priority of the campaign, saw "its development... aborted by the mistakes of the Great Leap Forward."&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, Dwight (1991).

It is widely regarded by historians that The Great Leap resulted in tens of millions of deaths.&lt;ref&gt;Tao Yang, Dennis (2008). [http://www.palgrave-journals.com/ces/journal/v50/n1/full/ces20084a.html "China's Agricultural Crisis and Famine of 1959–1961: A Survey and Comparison to Soviet Famines."] [[Palgrave MacMillan]], ''Comparative Economic Studies'' 50, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–29.&lt;/ref&gt; A lower-end estimate is 18 million, while extensive research by Chinese historian Yu Xiguang suggests the death toll from the movement is closer to 55.6 million.&lt;ref name=libé/&gt; Fellow historian [[Frank Dikötter]] asserts that "coercion, terror, and systematic violence were the foundation of the Great Leap Forward" and it "motivated one of the most deadly mass killings of human history".&lt;ref&gt;Dikötter, Frank (2010). pp.&amp;nbsp;x, xi. {{ISBN|0-8027-7768-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The years of the Great Leap Forward saw economic regression, with 1958 through 1962 being one of two periods between 1953 and 1976 in which [[Economy of China|China's economy]] shrank.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinability.com/GDP.htm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130716180612/http://www.chinability.com/GDP.htm |date=2013-07-16 }}  The Cultural Revolution was the other period during which the economy shrank.&lt;/ref&gt; Political economist [[Dwight H. Perkins (economist)|Dwight Perkins]] argues, "enormous amounts of investment produced only modest increases in production or none at all. ... In short, the Great Leap was a very expensive disaster."&lt;ref&gt;Perkins (1991). pp.&amp;nbsp;483–486 for quoted text, p.&amp;nbsp;493 for growth rates table.&lt;/ref&gt;

In subsequent conferences in March 1960 and May 1962, the negative effects of the Great Leap Forward were studied by the CPC, and Mao was criticized in the party conferences. Moderate Party members like President [[Liu Shaoqi]] and [[Deng Xiaoping]] rose to power, and Chairman Mao was marginalized within the party, leading him to initiate the [[Cultural Revolution]] in 1966.

==Background==
{{Main|History of the People's Republic of China (1949–76)}}
In October 1949 after the defeat of the [[Kuomintang]] (Chinese Nationalist Party, pinyin: Guomindang), the Chinese Communist Party proclaimed the establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]]. Immediately, landlords and wealthier peasants had their land holdings forcibly redistributed to poorer peasants. In the agricultural sectors, crops deemed by the Party to be "full of evil", such as [[opium]], were destroyed and replaced with crops such as [[rice]].

Within the Party, there was a major debate about redistribution. A moderate faction within the party and [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China|Politburo]] member [[Liu Shaoqi]] argued that change should be gradual and any [[collectivization]] of the peasantry should wait until [[industrialization]], which could provide the agricultural machinery for mechanized farming. A more radical faction led by [[Mao Zedong]] argued that the best way to finance industrialization was for the government to take control of agriculture, thereby establishing a monopoly over grain distribution and supply. This would allow the state to buy at a low price and sell much higher, thus raising the capital necessary for the industrialization of the country.

===Agricultural collectives and other social changes===
[[File:Sending officials to the countryside.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Sending government officials to work in the countryside, 1957]]

Before 1949, peasants had farmed their own small pockets of land and observed traditional practices—festivals, banquets, and paying homage to ancestors.&lt;ref name=mirsky/&gt; It was realized that Mao's policy of using a state monopoly on agriculture to finance industrialization would be unpopular with the peasants. Therefore, it was proposed that the peasants should be brought under Party control by the establishment of agricultural [[collective]]s which would also facilitate the sharing of tools and draft animals.&lt;ref name=mirsky/&gt;

This policy was gradually pushed through between 1949 and 1958 in response to immediate policy needs, first by establishing "mutual aid teams" of 5–15 households, then in 1953 "elementary agricultural cooperatives" of 20–40 households, then from 1956 in "higher co-operatives" of 100–300 families. From 1954 onward peasants were encouraged to form and join collective-farming associations, which would supposedly increase their efficiency without robbing them of their own land or restricting their livelihoods.&lt;ref name=mirsky/&gt;

By 1958 private ownership was entirely abolished and households all over China were forced into state-operated communes. Mao insisted that the communes must produce more grain for the cities and earn foreign exchange from exports.&lt;ref name=mirsky/&gt;  These reforms (sometimes now referred to as ''The Great Leap Forward'') were generally unpopular with the peasants and usually implemented by summoning them to meetings and making them stay there for days and sometimes weeks until they "voluntarily" agreed to join the collective.

Apart from progressive taxation on each household's harvest, the state introduced a system of compulsory state purchases of grain at fixed prices to build up stockpiles for famine-relief and meet the terms of its trade agreements with the [[Soviet Union]]. Together, taxation and compulsory purchases accounted for 30% of the harvest by 1957, leaving very little surplus. Rationing was also introduced in the cities to curb 'wasteful consumption' and encourage savings (which were deposited in state-owned banks and thus became available for investment), and although food could be purchased from state-owned retailers the market price was higher than that for which it had been purchased. This too was done in the name of discouraging excessive consumption.

Besides these economic changes the Party implemented major social changes in the countryside including the banishing of all religious and mystic institutions and ceremonies, replacing them with political meetings and [[propaganda]] sessions. Attempts were made to enhance rural education and the status of women (allowing them to initiate [[divorce]] if they desired) and ending [[foot-binding]], [[child marriage]] and [[opium]] addiction. The old system of internal passports (the ''[[Hukou system|hukou]]'') was introduced in 1956, preventing inter-county travel without appropriate authorization. Highest priority was given to the urban [[proletariat]] for whom a [[welfare state]] was created.

The first phase of collectivization resulted in only modest improvements in output. Famine along the mid-Yangzi was averted in 1956 through the timely allocation of food-aid, but in 1957 the Party's response was to increase the proportion of the harvest collected by the state to insure against further disasters. Moderates within the Party, including [[Zhou Enlai]], argued for a reversal of collectivization on the grounds that claiming the bulk of the harvest for the state had made the people's food-security dependent upon the constant, efficient, and transparent functioning of the government.

===Hundred Flowers Campaign and Anti-Rightist Campaign===
In 1957 Mao responded to the tensions in the Party by promoting free speech and criticism under the [[Hundred Flowers Campaign]]. In retrospect, some have come to argue that this was a ploy to allow critics of the regime, primarily intellectuals but also low ranking members of the party critical of the agricultural policies, to identify themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jung Chang|Chang, Jung]] and [[Jon Halliday|Halliday, Jon]] (2005). ''[[Mao: The Unknown Story]]'', [[Alfred A. Knopf|Knopf]]. p.&amp;nbsp;435. {{ISBN|0-679-42271-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the completion of the first 5 Year Economic Plan in 1957, Mao had come to doubt that the path to socialism that had been taken by the Soviet Union was appropriate for China. He was critical of Khrushchev's reversal of Stalinist policies and alarmed by the uprisings that had taken place in [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany|East Germany]], [[Poznań 1956 protests|Poland]] and [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungary]], and the perception that the USSR was seeking "[[peaceful coexistence]]" with the Western powers. Mao had become convinced that China should follow its own path to [[communism]].  According to Jonathan Mirsky, a historian and journalist specializing in Chinese affairs, China's isolation from most of the rest of the world, along with the [[Korean War]], had accelerated Mao's attacks on his perceived domestic enemies. It led him to accelerate his designs to develop an economy where the regime would get maximum benefit from rural taxation.&lt;ref name=mirsky&gt;Mirsky, Jonathan.

===Surpass the UK and US===

In November 1957, to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, party leaders of the communist countries gathered in Moscow. The first [[General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Secretary of the Central Committee]] [[Nikita Khrushchev]] proposed a goal to not only catch up with but exceed the United States in industrial output in the next 15 years through peaceful competition.

Mao Zedong was so inspired by the slogan that China put forward its own objective: to catch up with and surpass the UK in 15 years.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Comrade Khrushchev has told us, the Soviet Union 15 years later will surpass the United States of America. I can also say, 15 years later, we may catch up with or exceed the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author =[[Nikita Khrushchev]] 赫鲁晓夫 |title = Khrushchev's Memoirs|trans-title=赫鲁晓夫回忆录 |date =1970|publisher =Little Brown &amp; company|pages =250–257 |isbn= 0316831409}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Organizational and operational factors==
The Great Leap Forward campaign began during the period of the Second Five Year Plan which was scheduled to run from 1958 to 1963, though the campaign itself was discontinued by 1961.&lt;ref name="glossary"&gt;Li, Kwok-sing (1995).

The central idea behind the Great Leap was that rapid development of China's agricultural and industrial sectors should take place in parallel. The hope was to industrialize by making use of the massive supply of cheap labour and avoid having to import heavy machinery. The government also sought to avoid both social stratification and technical bottlenecks involved in the Soviet model of development, but sought political rather than technical solutions to do so. Distrusting technical experts,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Cambridge University Press |volume= 14, Part 1 | last = Lieberthal | first = Kenneth | title = The People's Republic, Part 1: The Emergence of Revolutionary China, 1949–1965 | chapter = The Great Leap Forward and the split in the Yenan leadership | location = Cambridge | series = The Cambridge History of China | year = 1987 | chapterurl = http://histories.cambridge.org/extract?id=chol9780521243360_CHOL9780521243360A008 |isbn= 978-0-521-24336-0  | page = 301}} "Thus, the [1957] Anti-Rightist Campaign in both urban and rural areas bolstered the position of those who believed that proper mobilization of the populace could accomplish tasks that the 'bourgeois experts' dismissed as impossible."&lt;/ref&gt; Mao and the party sought to replicate the strategies used in its 1930s regrouping in [[Yan'an]] following the [[Long March]]: "mass mobilization, social leveling, attacks on bureaucratism, [and] disdain for material obstacles."&lt;ref&gt;Lieberthal (1987). p.&amp;nbsp;304.&lt;/ref&gt; Mao advocated that a further round of [[collectivization]] modeled on the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]'s "[[Third Period]]" was necessary in the countryside where the existing collectives would be merged into huge [[People's commune|People's Communes]].

===People's communes===
{{Main|People's commune}}
[[File:People's commone canteen3.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|In the beginning, commune members were able to eat for free at the commune canteens. This changed when food production slowed to a halt.]]

An experimental commune was established at Chayashan in [[Henan]] in April 1958. Here for the first time private plots were entirely abolished and communal kitchens were introduced. At the [[Politburo]] meetings in August 1958, it was decided that these people's communes would become the new form of economic and political organization throughout rural China. By the end of the year approximately 25,000 communes had been set up, with an average of 5,000 households each. The communes were relatively self-sufficient co-operatives where wages and money were replaced by work points.

Based on his fieldwork, Ralph A. Thaxton Jr. describes the people's communes as a form of "[[Crime of apartheid|apartheid system]]" for Chinese farm households. The commune system was aimed at maximizing production for provisioning the cities and constructing offices, factories, schools, and social insurance systems for urban-dwelling workers, [[cadres]] and officials. Citizens in rural areas who criticized the system were labeled "dangerous." Escape was also difficult or impossible, and those who attempted were subjected to "party-orchestrated public struggle," which further jeopardized their survival.&lt;ref&gt;Thaxton, Ralph A. Jr (2008). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=14A1qPQOgQMC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Catastrophe and Contention in Rural China: Mao's Great Leap Forward Famine and the Origins of Righteous Resistance in Da Fo Village]''. [[Cambridge University Press]]. p.&amp;nbsp;3. {{ISBN|0-521-72230-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides agriculture, communes also incorporated some light industry and construction projects.

===Industrialization===
[[File:Backyardfurnace5.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|People in the countryside working at night to produce steel]]

Mao saw grain and steel production as the key pillars of economic development. He forecast that within 15 years of the start of the Great Leap, China's industrial output would surpass that of the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. In the August 1958 Politburo meetings, it was decided that steel production would be set to double within the year, most of the increase coming through backyard steel furnaces.&lt;ref name="Chan2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alfred L. Chan|title=Mao's Crusade : Politics and Policy Implementation in China's Great Leap Forward| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9pPxwn6EvR4C&amp;pg=PA69|date=7 June 2001| publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-155401-8|pages=71–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major investments in larger state enterprises were made: 1,587, 1,361, and 1,815 medium- and large-scale state projects were started in 1958, 1959, and 1960 respectively, more in each year than in the first Five Year Plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Cambridge University Press | isbn = 978-0-521-24336-0 | editors = Roderick MacFarquhar (ed.) | last = Lardy | first = R.

Millions of Chinese became state workers as a consequence of this industrial investment: in 1958, 21 million were added to non-agricultural state payrolls, and total state employment reached a peak of 50.44 million in 1960, more than doubling the 1957 level; the urban population swelled by 31.24 million people.&lt;ref name=Lardy368&gt;Lardy and Fairbank (1987). p.&amp;nbsp;368.&lt;/ref&gt; These new workers placed major stress on China's food-rationing system, which led to increased and unsustainable demands on rural food production.&lt;ref name=Lardy368 /&gt;

During this rapid expansion, coordination suffered and material shortages were frequent, resulting in "a huge rise in the wage bill, largely for construction workers, but no corresponding increase in manufactured goods."&lt;ref name="Lardy387"&gt;Lardy and Fairbank (1987). pp.&amp;nbsp;38–87.&lt;/ref&gt; Facing a massive deficit, the government cut industrial investment from 38.9 to 7.1 billion yuan from 1960 to 1962 (an 82% decrease; the 1957 level was 14.4 billion).&lt;ref name="Lardy387"/&gt;

===Backyard furnaces===
{{Main|Backyard furnace}}
[[File:Backyard furnace4.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|[[Backyard furnace]]s in China during the Great Leap Forward era]]

With no personal knowledge of [[metallurgy]], Mao encouraged the establishment of small [[backyard furnace|backyard steel furnaces]] in every commune and in each urban neighborhood.  Mao was shown an example of a backyard furnace in [[Hefei]], [[Anhui]] in September 1958 by provincial first secretary [[Zeng Xisheng]].&lt;ref name="Zhi-Sui2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Li Zhi-Sui|title=The Private Life of Chairman Mao|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VyU6fwmdjf8C&amp;pg=PA278|date=22 June 2011|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-79139-9|pages=272–274, 278}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unit was claimed to be manufacturing high quality steel.&lt;ref name="Zhi-Sui2011"/&gt;

Huge efforts on the part of peasants and other workers were made to produce steel out of scrap metal. To fuel the furnaces, the local environment was denuded of trees and wood taken from the doors and furniture of peasants' houses. Pots, pans, and other metal artifacts were requisitioned to supply the "scrap" for the furnaces so that the wildly optimistic production targets could be met. Many of the male agricultural workers were diverted from the harvest to help the iron production as were the workers at many factories, schools, and even hospitals. Although the output consisted of low quality lumps of [[pig iron]] which was of negligible economic worth, Mao had a deep distrust of intellectuals who could have pointed this out and instead placed his faith in the power of the mass mobilization of the peasants.

Moreover, the experience of the intellectual classes following the [[Hundred Flowers Campaign]] silenced those aware of the folly of such a plan. According to his private doctor, [[Li Zhisui]], Mao and his entourage visited traditional steel works in [[Manchuria]] in January 1959 where he found out that high quality steel could only be produced in large-scale factories using reliable fuel such as coal. However, he decided not to order a halt to the backyard steel furnaces so as not to dampen the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses. The program was only quietly abandoned much later in that year.

===Irrigation===
Substantial effort was expended during the Great Leap Forward on large-scale, but often poorly planned, capital construction projects, such as [[irrigation]] works built without input from trained engineers. Mao was well aware of the human cost of these water conservancy campaigns. In early 1958, while listening to a report on irrigation in Jiangsu, he mentioned that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Wu Zhipu claims he can move 30 billion cubic metres; I think 30,000 people will die. Zeng Xisheng has said that he will move 20 billion cubic metres, and I think that 20,000 people will die. Weiqing only promises 600 million cubic metres, maybe nobody will die.&lt;ref name="Dikotter33"&gt;Dikötter, Frank (2010). p.&amp;nbsp;33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weiqing421"&gt;Weiqing, Jiang (1996). ''Qishi nian zhengcheng: Jiang Weiqing huiyilu.'' (A seventy-year journey: The memoirs of Jiang Weiqing) Jiangsu renmin chubanshe. p.&amp;nbsp;421. {{ISBN|7-214-01757-1}} is the source of Dikötter's quote.  Mao, who had been continually interrupting, was speaking here in praise of Jiang Weiqing's plan (which called for moving 300 million cubic meters). Weiqing states that the others' plans were "exaggerations," though Mao would go to criticize those cadres with objections to high targets at the National Congress in May (see p.&amp;nbsp;422).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Though Mao "criticized the excessive use of [[corvée]] for large-scale water conservancy projects" in late 1958,&lt;ref name="MacFarquhar150"&gt;MacFarquhar, Roderick (1983). ''The Origins of the Cultural Revolution, Vol. 2'' Columbia University Press. p.&amp;nbsp;150. {{ISBN|0-231-05717-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; mass mobilization on irrigation works continued unabated for the next several years, and claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of exhausted, starving villagers.&lt;ref name="Dikotter33"/&gt; The inhabitants of Qingshui and Gansu referred to these projects as the "killing fields."&lt;ref name="Dikotter33"/&gt;

===Crop experiments===

On the communes, a number of radical and controversial agricultural innovations were promoted at the behest of Mao. Many of these were based on the [[Lysenkoism|ideas]] of now discredited Soviet agronomist [[Trofim Lysenko]] and his followers. The policies included close cropping, whereby seeds were sown far more densely than normal on the incorrect assumption that seeds of the same class would not compete with each other.&lt;ref&gt;Dikötter (2010). p.&amp;nbsp;39.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deep plowing]] (up to 2&amp;nbsp;m deep) was encouraged on the mistaken belief that this would yield plants with extra large root systems. Moderately productive land was left unplanted with the belief that concentrating manure and effort on the most fertile land would lead to large per-acre productivity gains. Altogether, these untested innovations generally led to decreases in grain production rather than increases.&lt;ref name=hinton1984&gt;{{Cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, local leaders were pressured into falsely reporting ever-higher grain production figures to their political superiors. Participants at political meetings remembered production figures being inflated up to 10 times actual production amounts as the race to please superiors and win plaudits—like the chance to meet Mao himself—intensified. The state was later able to force many production groups to sell more grain than they could spare based on these false production figures.&lt;ref&gt;Hinton 1984, pp.&amp;nbsp;234–240, 247–249&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treatment of villagers===
[[File:Xinyang working at night.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Commune members working fields at night using lamps]]

The ban on [[private property|private holdings]] ruined peasant life at its most basic level, according to Mirsky. Villagers were unable to secure enough food to go on living because they were deprived by the [[People's commune|commune system]] of their traditional means of being able to rent, sell, or use their land as collateral for loans.&lt;ref name=mirsky /&gt; In one village, once the commune was operational the Party boss and his colleagues "swung into manic action, herding villagers into the fields to sleep and to work intolerable hours, and forcing them to walk, starving, to distant additional projects."&lt;ref name=mirsky /&gt;

Edward Friedman, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin, Paul Pickowicz, a historian at the University of California, San Diego, and [[Mark Selden]], a sociologist at Binghamton University, wrote about the dynamic of interaction between the Party and villagers:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Beyond attack, beyond question, was the systemic and structured dynamic of the [[socialist state]] that intimidated and [[impoverished]] millions of patriotic and loyal villagers.&lt;ref name=revolutionresistance&gt;Friedman, Edward; Pickowicz, Paul G.; and Selden, Mark (2006).  ''Revolution, Resistance, and Reform in Village China''. Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The authors present a similar picture to Thaxton in depicting the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]]'s destruction of the traditions of Chinese villagers. Traditionally prized local customs were deemed signs of "[[feudalism]]" to be extinguished, according to Mirsky. "Among them were funerals, weddings, local markets, and festivals. The Party thus destroyed "much that gave meaning to Chinese lives. These private bonds were social glue. To mourn and to celebrate is to be human. To share joy, grief, and pain is humanizing."&lt;ref name=mirsky2&gt;Mirsky, Jonathan.

Public [[Struggle session|criticism sessions]] were often used to intimidate the peasants into obeying local cadres; they increased the [[death rate]] of the famine in several ways, according to Thaxton. "In the first case, blows to the body caused internal injuries that, in combination with physical [[emaciation]] and acute [[hunger]], could induce death." In one case, after a peasant stole two cabbages from the common fields, the thief was publicly criticized for half a day. He collapsed, fell ill, and never recovered. Others were sent to [[labor camp]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Thaxton 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;212.&lt;/ref&gt;

Frank Dikötter writes that beatings with sticks was the most common method used by local [[professional revolutionaries|cadres]] and roughly half of all cadres regularly pummeled or caned people. Other cadres devised harsher means to humiliate and torture those who failed to keep up. As mass starvation set in, ever greater violence had to be inflicted in order to coerce malnourished people to labor in the fields. Victims were buried alive, thrown bound into ponds, stripped naked and forced to labor in the middle of winter, doused in boiling water, forced to ingest excrement and urine, and subjected to mutilation (hair ripped out, noses and ears lopped off). In [[Guangdong]], some cadres injected salt water into their victims with needles normally reserved for cattle.&lt;ref&gt;Dikötter (2010). pp.&amp;nbsp;294–296.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 6 to 8% of those who died during the Great Leap Forward were tortured to death or summarily killed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jasper Becker]].

Benjamin Valentino notes that "communist officials sometimes tortured and killed those accused of failing to meet their grain quota."&lt;ref name="Valentino128"/&gt;

However, J. G. Mahoney, Professor of Liberal Studies and East Asian Studies at [[Grand Valley State University]], has said that "there is too much diversity and dynamism in the country for one work to capture ... rural China as if it were one place."  Mahoney describes an elderly man in rural [[Shanxi]] who recalls Mao fondly, saying "Before Mao we sometimes ate leaves, after liberation we did not." Regardless, Mahoney points out that Da Fo villagers recall the Great Leap as a period of famine and death, and among those who survived in Da Fo were precisely those who could digest leaves.&lt;ref&gt;Mahoney, Josef Gregory (2009).

===Lushan Conference===
{{Main|Lushan Conference}}
The initial impact of the Great Leap Forward was discussed at the [[Lushan Conference]] in July/August 1959. Although many of the more moderate leaders had reservations about the new policy, the only senior leader to speak out openly was Marshal [[Peng Dehuai]]. Mao responded to Peng's criticism of the Great Leap by dismissing Peng from his post as Defence Minister, denouncing Peng (who came from a poor peasant family) and his supporters as "bourgeois," and launching a nationwide campaign against "rightist opportunism." Peng was replaced by [[Lin Biao]], who began a systematic purge of Peng's supporters from the military.

==Consequences==
[[File:Birth rate in China.svg|thumb|upright=2|{{center|Birth and death rate in China}}]]

The failure of agricultural policies, the movement of farmers from agricultural to industrial work, and weather conditions led to millions of deaths from severe famine.  Many also died from quota-based executions instituted by government officials.  The economy, which had improved since the end of the civil war, was devastated.  In response to the severe conditions, there was resistance among the populace.

The effects on the upper levels of government in response to the disaster were complex, with Mao purging the Minister of National Defense Peng Dehuai in 1959, the temporary promotion of [[Lin Biao]], [[Liu Shaoqi]], and [[Deng Xiaoping]], and Mao losing some power and prestige following the Great Leap Forward, which led him to launch the Cultural Revolution in 1966.

===Famine===
{{Main|Great Chinese Famine}}

Despite the harmful agricultural innovations, the weather in 1958 was very favorable and the harvest promised to be good. Unfortunately, the amount of labour diverted to steel production and construction projects meant that much of the harvest was left to rot uncollected in some areas.  This problem was exacerbated by a devastating [[locust]] swarm, which was caused when their natural predators were killed as part of the [[Great Sparrow Campaign]].

Although actual harvests were reduced, local officials, under tremendous pressure from central authorities to report record harvests in response to the innovations, competed with each other to announce increasingly exaggerated results. These were used as a basis for determining the amount of grain to be taken by the State to supply the towns and cities, and to export. This left barely enough for the peasants, and in some areas, starvation set in. A 1959 drought and flooding from the [[Yellow River]] in the same year also contributed to famine.

[[File:Tree-Sparrow-2009-16-02.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The [[Eurasian tree sparrow]] was the most notable target of the [[Four Pests Campaign]].]]

During 1958–1960 China continued to be a substantial net exporter of grain, despite the widespread famine experienced in the countryside, as Mao sought to maintain face and convince the outside world of the success of his plans. Foreign aid was refused. When the Japanese foreign minister told his Chinese counterpart Chen Yi of an offer of 100,000 tonnes of wheat to be shipped out of public view, he was rebuffed. [[John F. Kennedy]] was also aware that the Chinese were exporting food to Africa and Cuba during the famine and said "we've had no indication from the Chinese Communists that they would welcome any offer of food."&lt;ref name="Dikotter114115"&gt;Dikötter, Frank (1991). pp.&amp;nbsp;114–115.&lt;/ref&gt;

With dramatically reduced yields, even urban areas suffered much reduced rations; however, mass starvation was largely confined to the countryside, where, as a result of drastically inflated production statistics, very little grain was left for the peasants to eat. Food shortages were bad throughout the country; however, the provinces which had adopted Mao's reforms with the most vigor, such as [[Anhui]], [[Gansu]] and [[Henan]], tended to suffer disproportionately. [[Sichuan]], one of China's most populous provinces, known in China as "Heaven's Granary" because of its fertility, is thought to have suffered the greatest absolute numbers of deaths from starvation due to the vigor with which provincial leader Li Jinquan undertook Mao's reforms. During the Great Leap Forward, cases of [[cannibalism]] also occurred in the parts of China that were severely affected by famine.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Richard.

Bernstein reviews Hungry Ghosts by Jasper Becker.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=yang2013/&gt;

Great suffering was experienced even by those who survived the famine. Author [[Yan Lianke]] who endured the Great Leap growing up in Henan was taught by his mother to "recognize the most edible kinds of bark and clay. When all the trees had been stripped and there was no more clay, he learned that lumps of coal could appease the devil in his stomach, at least for a little while."&lt;ref name="forbidden"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fan |first1=Jiayang |title=Yan Lianke’s Forbidden Satires of China |journal=The New Yorker |date=15 October 2018 |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/10/15/yan-liankes-forbidden-satires-of-china |accessdate=31 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The agricultural policies of the Great Leap Forward and the associated famine continued until January 1961, when, at the Ninth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, the restoration of agricultural production through a reversal of the Great Leap policies was started. Grain exports were stopped, and imports from [[Canada]] and [[Australia]] helped to reduce the impact of the food shortages, at least in the coastal cities.

====Famine deaths====

The exact number of famine deaths is difficult to determine, and estimates range from upwards of 30 million, to 55 million people.&lt;ref name=dikotterxii/&gt;&lt;ref name=libé&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liberation.fr/planete/2011/06/17/la-chine-creuse-ses-trous-de-memoire_743211|title=La Chine creuse ses  trous de mémoire|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of the uncertainties involved in estimating famine deaths caused by the Great Leap Forward or any [[List of famines|famine]], it is difficult to compare the severity of different famines.  However, if a mid-estimate of 30 million deaths is accepted, the Great Leap Forward was the deadliest famine in the history of China and in the history of the world.&lt;ref name=ashton614/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yang, Jisheng (2010) [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10670564.2010.485408 "The Fatal Politics of the PRC's Great Leap Famine: The Preface to Tombstone"] Journal of Contemporary China. Volume 19 Issue 66. pp.&amp;nbsp;755–776.  Retrieved 3 Sep 2011.  Yang excerpts Sen, Amartya (1999). ''Democracy as a universal value''. ''Journal of Democracy'' 10(3), pp.&amp;nbsp;3–17 who calls it "the largest recorded famine in world history: nearly 30 million people died".&lt;/ref&gt;  This was in part due to China's large population;   in  the [[Great Irish Famine]], approximately 1 million&lt;ref&gt;Wright, John W. (gen ed) (1992). ''The Universal Almanac''.    The Banta Company.  Harrisonburg, Va. p.&amp;nbsp;411.&lt;/ref&gt; of a population of 8 million people died, or 12.5%. In the Great Chinese Famine approximately 30 million of a population of 600 million people died, or 5%.

The Great Leap Forward reversed the downward trend in mortality that had occurred since 1950,&lt;ref name=coale84/&gt; though even during the Leap, mortality may not have reached pre-1949 levels.&lt;ref&gt;Li, Minqi (2009).

Li compares official crude death rates for the years 1959–1962 (11.98, 14.59, 25.43, and 14.24 per thousand, respectively) with the "nationwide crude death rate reported by the Nationalist government for the years 1936 and 1938 (27.6 and 28.2 per thousand, respectively).&lt;/ref&gt;  Famine deaths and the reduction in number of births caused the population of China to drop in 1960 and 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Ashton (1984). p.&amp;nbsp;615, Banister (1987). p.&amp;nbsp;42, both get their data from Statistical Yearbook of China 1983 published by the State Statistical Bureau.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was only the third time in 600 years that the population of China had decreased.&lt;ref name=banister3&gt;Banister, Judith (1987).

Stanford. p.&amp;nbsp;3.&lt;/ref&gt;  After the Great Leap Forward, mortality rates decreased to below pre-Leap levels and the downward trend begun in 1950 continued.&lt;ref name=coale84/&gt;

The severity of the famine varied from region to region.  By correlating the increase in death rates of different provinces, Peng Xizhe found that [[Gansu]], [[Sichuan]], [[Guizhou]], [[Hunan]], [[Guangxi]], and [[Anhui]] were the worst-hit regions, while  [[Heilongjiang]], [[Inner Mongolia]], [[Xinjiang]], [[Tianjin]], and [[Shanghai]] had the lowest increase in death rate during the Great Leap Forward (there was no data for Tibet).&lt;ref name=peng646&gt;Peng (1987). pp.&amp;nbsp;646–648&lt;/ref&gt;  Peng also noted that the increase in death rate in urban areas was  about half the increase in rural areas.&lt;ref name=peng646/&gt;  [[Fuyang, Anhui|Fuyang]], a region in Anhui with a population of 8 million in 1958, had a death rate that rivaled [[Democratic Kampuchea|Cambodia]] under the [[Khmer Rouge]];&lt;ref&gt;Dikötter, Frank (2010-10-13).[http://asiasociety.org/video/countries-history/maos-great-famine-complete Mao's Great Famine (Complete)].

The number of famine deaths during the Great Leap Forward has been estimated by different methods. Banister, Coale, and Ashton ''et al.'' compare age cohorts from the 1953, 1964, and 1982 censuses, yearly birth and death records, and results of the 1982 1:1000 fertility survey. From these they calculate excess deaths above a death rate interpolated between pre- and post-Leap death rates. All involve corrections for perceived errors inherent in the different data sets.&lt;ref&gt;Banister (1987). pp.&amp;nbsp;118–120.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coale (1984). pp.&amp;nbsp;1, 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ashton, et al. (1984). pp.&amp;nbsp;613, 616–619.&lt;/ref&gt; Peng uses reported deaths from the vital statistics of 14 provinces, adjusts 10% for under reporting, and expands the result to cover all of China assuming similar mortality rates in the other provinces. He uses 1956/57 death rates as the baseline death rate rather than an interpolation between pre- and post-GLF death rates.&lt;ref&gt;Peng (1987). pp.&amp;nbsp;645, 648–649. Peng used the pre-Leap death rate as a base line under the assumption that the decrease after the Great Leap to below pre-Leap levels was caused by Darwinian selection during the massive deaths of the famine. He writes that if this drop was instead a continuation of the decreasing mortality in the years prior to the Great Leap, his estimate would be an underestimate.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cao uses information from "local annals" to determine for each locality the expected population increase from normal births and deaths, the population increase due to migration, and the loss of population between 1958 and 1961. He then adds the three figures to determine the number of excess deaths during the period 1959–1961.&lt;ref name=yang272&gt;Yang Jisheng (2012).

Farrar, Straus and Giroux. p.&amp;nbsp;427. {{ISBN|9781466827790}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Chang and Halliday use death rates determined by "Chinese demographers" for the years 1957–1963, subtract the average of the pre-and post-Leap death rates (1957, 1962, and 1963) from the death rates of each of the years 1958–1961, and multiply each yearly excess death rate by the year's population to determine excess deaths.&lt;ref name=chang438&gt;Chang and Halliday (2005) p.&amp;nbsp;438&lt;/ref&gt;

Chen was part of a large investigation by the System Reform Institute think tank (Tigaisuo) which "visited every province and examined internal Party documents and records."&lt;ref&gt;Becker (1996). pp.&amp;nbsp;271–272.&lt;/ref&gt;

Becker, Rummel, Dikötter, and Yang each compare several earlier estimates. Becker considers Banister's estimate of 30 million excess deaths to be "the most reliable estimate we have".&lt;ref name=becker270 /&gt; Rummel initially took Coale's 27 million as a "most likely figure",&lt;ref name=rummel248&gt;Rummel (1991). p.&amp;nbsp;248.&lt;/ref&gt; then accepted the later estimate of 38 million by Chang and Halliday after it was published.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ciolek.com/spec/rummel-on-democide-2005.html Reevaluated democide totals for 20th C. and China] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140827070539/http://www.ciolek.com/SPEC/rummel-on-democide-2005.html |date=2014-08-27 }} Rudy J. Rummel Retrieved 22 Oct 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Dikötter judged Chen's estimate of 43 to 46 million to be "in all likelihood a reliable estimate."&lt;ref name="dikotter333"/&gt; Yang takes Cao's, Wang Weizhi's, and Jin Hui's estimates ranging from 32.5 to 35 million excess deaths for the period 1959–1961, adds his own estimates for 1958 (0.42 million) and 1962 (2.23 million) "based on official figures reported by the provinces" to get 35 to 37 million, and chooses 36 million as a number that "approaches the reality but is still too low."&lt;ref name=yang230 /&gt;

Estimates contain several sources of error.

Under-reporting of deaths was also a problem. The death registration system, which was inadequate before the famine,&lt;ref name=banister85&gt;Banister (1987). p.&amp;nbsp;85.&lt;/ref&gt; was completely overwhelmed by the large number of deaths during the famine.&lt;ref name=banister85 /&gt;&lt;ref name=becker269&gt;Becker (1996). pp.&amp;nbsp;268–269.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dikötter (2010) p.&amp;nbsp;327.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, many deaths went unreported so that family members of the deceased could continue to draw the deceased's food ration. Counting the number of children who both were born and died between the 1953 and 1964 censuses is problematic.&lt;ref name=becker269 /&gt; However, Ashton, ''et al.'' believe that because the reported number of births during the GLF seems accurate, the reported number of deaths should be accurate as well.&lt;ref&gt;Ashton et al. (1984). p.&amp;nbsp;617.&lt;/ref&gt; Massive internal migration made both population counts and registering deaths problematic,&lt;ref name=becker269 /&gt; though Yang believes the degree of unofficial internal migration was small&lt;ref&gt;Yang (2012) p.&amp;nbsp;430.&lt;/ref&gt; and Cao's estimate takes internal migration into account.&lt;ref name=yang272 /&gt;

Coale's, Banister's, Ashton ''et al.''{{'}}s, and Peng's figures all include adjustments for demographic reporting errors, though Dikötter believes that their results, as well as Chang and Halliday's, Yang's, and Cao's, are still underestimates.&lt;ref&gt;Dikotter (2010) p.&amp;nbsp;324. (Dikötter does not mention Coale on this page).&lt;/ref&gt; The System Reform Institute's (Chen's) estimate has not been published and therefore it cannot be verified.&lt;ref name=yang272 /&gt;

====Causes of the famine and responsibility====
The policies of the Great Leap Forward, the failure of the government to respond quickly and effectively to famine conditions, as well as Mao's insistence on maintaining high grain export quotas in the face of clear evidence of poor crop output were responsible for the famine. There is disagreement over how much, if at all, weather conditions contributed to the famine.  Also there is considerable evidence the famine was intentional or due to willful negligence.

[[Yang Jisheng (historian)|Yang Jisheng]], a long-time communist party member and a reporter for the official Chinese news agency [[Xinhua]], puts the blame squarely on [[Maoist]] policies and the political system of [[totalitarianism]],&lt;ref name=yang2013&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/01/china-great-famine-book-tombstone|title=China's Great Famine: the true story|author=Branigan, Tania|publisher=The Guardian|date=1 January 2013|accessdate=15 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as diverting agricultural workers to steel production instead of growing crops, and exporting grain at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Yu, Verna (2008).

Applebaum writes about ''Tombstone'' by Yang Jishen.&lt;/ref&gt; During the course of his research, Yang uncovered that some 22 million tons of grain was held in public granaries at the height of the famine, reports of the starvation went up the bureaucracy only to be ignored by top officials, and the authorities ordered that statistics be destroyed in regions where population decline became evident.&lt;ref&gt;Link, Perry (2010).

Economist [[Steven Rosefielde]] argues that Yang's account "shows that Mao's slaughter was caused in considerable part by terror-starvation; that is, voluntary manslaughter (and perhaps murder) rather than innocuous famine."&lt;ref&gt;[[Steven Rosefielde|Rosefielde, Steven]] (2009). ''Red Holocaust''. [[Routledge]]. p.&amp;nbsp;114. {{ISBN|0-415-77757-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Yang notes that local party officials were indifferent to the large number of people dying around them, as their primary concern was the delivery of grain, which Mao wanted to use to pay back debts to the USSR totaling 1.973 billion [[Chinese yuan|yuan]]. In [[Xinyang]], people died of starvation at the doors of grain warehouses.&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, Mark (2008).

Holt Paperbacks. p.&amp;nbsp;81. {{ISBN|0-8050-5668-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

From his research into records and talks with experts at the meteorological bureau, Yang concludes that the weather during the Great Leap Forward was not unusual compared to other periods and was not a factor.&lt;ref name="yangint"&gt;Johnson, Ian (2010). [http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2010/dec/20/finding-facts-about-maos-victims/ Finding the Facts About Mao's Victims]. ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' (Blog), December 20, 2010. Retrieved 4 Sep 2011. Johnson interviews Yang Jishen. (Provincial and central archives).&lt;/ref&gt; Yang also believes that the Sino-Soviet split was not a factor because it did not happen until 1960, when the famine was well under way.&lt;ref name="yangint"/&gt;

[[Jung Chang|Chang]] and [[Jon Halliday|Halliday]] argue that "Mao had actually allowed for many more deaths. Although slaughter was not his purpose with the Leap, he was more than ready for myriad deaths to result, and had hinted to his top echelon that they should not be too shocked if they happened."&lt;ref&gt;Chang ang Halliday (2005). p.&amp;nbsp;457.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Democide]] historian [[Rudolph Rummel|R.J. Rummel]] had originally classified the famine deaths as unintentional.&lt;ref&gt;Rummel (1991). pp.&amp;nbsp;249–250.&lt;/ref&gt; In light of evidence provided in Chang and Halliday's book, he now believes that the mass human deaths associated with the Great Leap Forward constitute democide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://democraticpeace.wordpress.com/2008/11/24/getting-my-reestimate-of-maos-democide-out/|title=Getting My Reestimate Of Mao's Democide Out|date=2005-11-30|accessdate=2007-04-09|author=Rummel, R.J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Frank Dikötter, Mao and the Communist Party knew that some of their policies were contributing to the starvation.&lt;ref name="Dikotter"&gt;Dikötter, Frank. [http://web.mac.com/dikotter/Dikotter/Famine_2.html Mao’s Great Famine, Key Arguments] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809001243/http://web.mac.com/dikotter/Dikotter/Famine_2.html |date=2011-08-09 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign minister [[Chen Yi (communist)|Chen Yi]] said of some of the early human losses in November 1958:&lt;ref name="Dikotter70"&gt;Dikötter (2010). p.&amp;nbsp;70.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Casualties have indeed appeared among workers, but it is not enough to stop us in our tracks. This is the price we have to pay, it's nothing to be afraid of. Who knows how many people have been sacrificed on the battlefields and in the prisons [for the revolutionary cause]? Now we have a few cases of illness and death: it's nothing!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During a secret meeting in Shanghai in 1959, Mao demanded the state procurement of one-third of all grain to feed the cities and satisfy foreign clients, and noted that "If you don't go above a third, people won't rebel." He also stated at the same meeting:&lt;ref name="Dikotter88"&gt;Dikötter (2010). p.&amp;nbsp;88.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;When there is not enough to eat people starve to death. It is better to let half of the people die so that the other half can eat their fill.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Benjamin Valentino writes that like in the USSR during the [[Soviet famine of 1932–33|famine of 1932–33]], peasants were confined to their starving villages by a system of household registration,&lt;ref&gt;Valentino, Benjamin A. (2004). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=LQfeXVU_EvgC&amp;pg=PA127&amp;dq=soviet+union+mao+system+of+household+registration#v=onepage&amp;q=soviet%20union%20mao%20system%20of%20household%20registration&amp;f=false Final Solutions: Mass Killing and Genocide in the Twentieth Century]''. [[Cornell University Press]]. p.&amp;nbsp;127. {{ISBN|0-8014-3965-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the worst effects of the famine were directed against enemies of the regime.&lt;ref name="Valentino128"&gt;Valentino (2004). p.&amp;nbsp;128.&lt;/ref&gt; Those labeled as "black elements" (religious leaders, rightists, rich peasants, etc.) in any previous campaign were given the lowest priority in the allocation of food, and therefore died in the greatest numbers.&lt;ref name="Valentino128"/&gt; According to [[genocide]] scholar [[Adam Jones (Canadian scholar)|Adam Jones]], "no group suffered more than the [[Tibetans]]", with perhaps one in five dying from 1959 to 1962.&lt;ref&gt;[[Adam Jones (Canadian scholar)|Jones, Adam]] (2010). ''Genocide: A Comprehensive Introduction''. [[Routledge]], 2nd edition (August 1, 2010). p.&amp;nbsp;96. {{ISBN|0-415-48619-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ashton, ''et al.'' write that policies leading to food shortages, natural disasters, and a slow response to initial indications of food shortages were to blame for the famine.&lt;ref name=Ashton625&gt;Ashton, et al. (1984). pp.&amp;nbsp;624, 625.&lt;/ref&gt; Policies leading to food shortages included the implementation of the commune system and an emphasis on non-agricultural activities such as backyard steel production.&lt;ref name=Ashton625/&gt; Natural disasters included [[drought]], flood, typhoon, plant disease, and insect pest.&lt;ref name=ashton629&gt;Ashton, et al. (1984). p.&amp;nbsp;629.&lt;/ref&gt; The slow response was in part due to a lack of objective reporting on the agricultural situation,&lt;ref name=ashton634&gt;Ashton, et al. (1984). p.&amp;nbsp;634.&lt;/ref&gt; including a "nearly complete breakdown in the agricultural reporting system".&lt;ref name="ashton630"/&gt;

This was partly caused by strong incentives for officials to over-report crop yields.&lt;ref&gt;Ashton, et al. (1984). p.&amp;nbsp;626.&lt;/ref&gt; The unwillingness of the Central Government to seek international aid was a major factor; China's net grain exports in 1959 and 1960 would have been enough to feed 16 million people 2000 calories per day.&lt;ref name=ashton629/&gt; Ashton, ''et al.'' conclude that "It would not be inaccurate to say that 30 million people died prematurely as a result of errors of internal policy and flawed international relations."&lt;ref name=ashton634/&gt;

Mobo Gao suggested that the Great Leap Forward's terrible effects came not from malignant intent on the part of the Chinese leadership at the time, but instead related to the structural nature of its rule, and the vastness of China as a country. Gao says "the terrible lesson learnt is that China is so huge and when it is uniformly ruled, follies or wrong policies will have grave implications of tremendous magnitude".&lt;ref name="Gao. Mobo 2007"/&gt;

The PRC government's official web portal places the responsibility for the "serious losses" to "country and people" of 1959–1961 (without mentioning famine) mainly on the Great Leap Forward and the anti-rightist struggle, and lists weather and cancellation of contracts by the Soviet Union as contributing factors.&lt;ref&gt;Chinese Government's Official Web Portal (English). [http://english.gov.cn/2005-08/06/content_20912.htm China: a country with 5,000-year-long civilization] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601053642/http://english.gov.cn/2005-08/06/content_20912.htm |date=June 1, 2012 }}. Retrieved 3 Sep 2011. "It was mainly due to the errors of the great leap forward and of the struggle against "Right opportunism" together with a succession of natural calamities and the perfidious scrapping of contracts by the Soviet Government that our economy encountered serious difficulties between 1959 and 1961, which caused serious losses to our country and people."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deaths by violence===
Not all deaths during the Great Leap were from starvation. Frank Dikötter estimates that at least 2.5 million people were beaten or tortured to death and one million to three million committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Dikötter (2010). pp.&amp;nbsp;298, 304.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=scmp723956/&gt; He provides some illustrative examples. In [[Xinyang]], where over a million died in 1960, 6–7% (around 67,000) of these were beaten to death by the militias. In [[Daoxian]] county, 10% of those who died had been "buried alive, clubbed to death or otherwise killed by party members and their militia." In [[Shimen County|Shimen]] county, around 13,500 died in 1960, of these 12% were "beaten or driven to their deaths."&lt;ref&gt;Dikötter (2010). pp.&amp;nbsp;294, 297.&lt;/ref&gt;  In accounts documented by Yang Jisheng,&lt;ref name=yang2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=yang230/&gt; people were beaten or killed for rebelling against the government, reporting the real harvest numbers, for sounding alarm, for refusing to hand over what little food they had left, for trying to flee the famine area, for begging food or as little as stealing scraps or angering officials.

===Impact on economy===
During the Great Leap, the [[Chinese economy]] initially grew. Iron production increased 45% in 1958 and a combined 30% over the next two years, but plummeted in 1961, and did not reach the previous 1958 level until 1964.

The Great Leap also led to the greatest destruction of real estate in human history, outstripping any of the bombing campaigns from [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="Dikötterxi"&gt;Dikötter (2010). pp.&amp;nbsp;xi, xii.&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 30% to 40% of all houses were turned to rubble.&lt;ref&gt;Dikötter (2010). p.&amp;nbsp;169.&lt;/ref&gt;  Frank Dikötter states that "homes were pulled down to make fertilizer, to build canteens, relocate villagers, straighten roads, make place for a better future, or punish their owners."&lt;ref name="Dikötterxi"/&gt;

In agrarian policy, the failures of food supply during the Great Leap were met by a gradual de-[[collectivization]] in the 1960s that foreshadowed further de-collectivization under Deng Xiaoping. Political scientist [[Meredith Jung-En Woo]] argues: "Unquestionably the regime failed to respond in time to save the lives of millions of peasants, but when it did respond, it ultimately transformed the livelihoods of several hundred million peasants (modestly in the early 1960s, but permanently after Deng Xiaoping's reforms subsequent to 1978.)"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lsa.umich.edu/orgstudies/people_detail.asp?id=422 Woo-Cummings, Meredith] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20131129094106/http://www.lsa.umich.edu/orgstudies/people_detail.asp?id=422 |date=2013-11-29 }} (2002). {{cite web |url= http://www.adbi.org/files/2002.01.rp31.ecology.famine.northkorea.pdf |title= ''The Political Ecology of Famine: The North Korean Catastrophe and Its Lessons'' }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(807&amp;nbsp;KB)}}, ADB Institute Research Paper 31, January 2002. Retrieved 3 Jul 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the risks to their careers, some Communist Party members openly laid blame for the disaster at the feet of the Party leadership and took it as proof that China must rely more on education, acquiring technical expertise and applying [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] methods in developing the [[economic science|economy]]. [[Liu Shaoqi]] made a speech in 1962 at Seven Thousand Cadres Conference criticizing that "The economic disaster was 30% fault of nature, 70% [[human error]]."&lt;ref&gt;''Twentieth Century China: Third Volume''. Beijing, 1994. p.&amp;nbsp;430.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 paper by two [[Peking University]] economists found "strong evidence that the unrealistic yield targets led to excessive death tolls during 1959-61, and further analysis shows that yield targets induced the inflation of grain output figures and excessive procurement. We also find that Mao's radical policy caused serious deterioration in human capital accumulation and slower economic development in the policy-affected regions decades after the death of Mao."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=Chang|last2=Zhou|first2=Li-An|date=2017-11-21|title=Estimating the Short- and Long-Term Effects of MAO Zedong's Economic Radicalism|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3075015|location=Rochester, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resistance===
There were various forms of resistance to the Great Leap Forward.  Several provinces saw armed rebellion,&lt;ref name="Dikötter226"&gt;Dikötter (2010) pp.&amp;nbsp;226–228.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rummel247"&gt;Rummel (1991). pp.&amp;nbsp;247–251.&lt;/ref&gt; though these rebellions never posed a serious threat to the Central Government.&lt;ref name="Dikötter226"/&gt;  Rebellions are documented to have occurred in [[Henan]], [[Shandong]], [[Qinghai]], [[Gansu]], [[Sichuan]], [[Fujian]], and [[Yunnan]] provinces and in the [[Tibetan Autonomous Region]].&lt;ref name="Dikötter226b"&gt;Dikötter (2010) pp.&amp;nbsp;226–228 (Qinghai, Tibet, Yunnan).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rummel247b"&gt;Rummel (1991). pp.&amp;nbsp;247–251 (Honan, Shantung, Qinghai (Chinghai), Gansu (Kansu), Szechuan (Schechuan), Fujian), p.&amp;nbsp;240 (TAR).&lt;/ref&gt;  In Henan, Shandong, Qinghai, Gansu, and Sichuan, these rebellions lasted more than a year.&lt;ref name="Rummel247b"/&gt;  There was also occasional violence against cadre members.&lt;ref name="Rummel247"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dikötter224"&gt;Dikötter (2010) pp.&amp;nbsp;224–226.&lt;/ref&gt; Raids on granaries,&lt;ref name="Rummel247"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dikötter224"/&gt; arson and other vandalism, train robberies, and raids on neighboring villages and counties were common.&lt;ref name="Dikötter224"/&gt;

According to over 20 years of research by Ralph Thaxton, professor of politics at Brandeis University, villagers turned against the CPC during and after the Great Leap, seeing it as autocratic, brutal, corrupt, and mean-spirited.&lt;ref name=mirsky/&gt; The CPC's policies, which included plunder, forced labor, and starvation, according to Thaxton, led villagers "to think about their relationship with the Communist Party in ways that do not bode well for the continuity of socialist rule."&lt;ref name=mirsky/&gt;

Often, villagers composed [[doggerel]] to show their defiance to the regime, and "perhaps, to remain sane." During the Great Leap, one jingle ran: "Flatter shamelessly—eat delicacies.... Don't flatter—starve to death for sure."&lt;ref name=mirsky2/&gt;

===Impact on the government===
Many local officials were tried and publicly executed for giving out misinformation.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Edward; Pickowicz, Paul G.; Selden, Mark; and Johnson, Kay Ann (1993).  ''Chinese Village, Socialist State''. Yale University Press. p.&amp;nbsp;243. {{ISBN|0300054289}}/  As seen in [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0300054289&amp;id=GN2cXHxg_6oC&amp;pg=PA243&amp;lpg=PA243&amp;dq=wu+zhipu+henan+xinyang&amp;sig=N8jpvDEZe3NvS64YO0qa492A32k Google Book Search].&lt;/ref&gt;

Mao stepped down as State Chairman of the PRC in 1959, but remained CCP Chairman. Liu Shaoqi (the new PRC Chairman) and reformist [[Deng Xiaoping]] (CPC General Secretary) were left in charge to change policy to bring economic recovery. Mao's Great Leap Forward policy was openly criticized at the [[Lushan Conference|Lushan party conference]]. Criticism was led by Minister of National Defense [[Peng Dehuai]], who, initially troubled by the potentially adverse effect of the Great Leap on modernization of the armed forces, also admonished unnamed party members for trying to "jump into communism in one step." After the Lushan showdown, Mao replaced Peng with [[Lin Biao]].

However, by 1962, it was clear that the party had changed away from the extremist ideology that led to the Great Leap. During 1962, the party held a number of conferences and rehabilitated most of the deposed comrades who had criticized Mao in the aftermath of the Great Leap. The event was again discussed, with much [[self-criticism]], and the contemporary government called it a "serious [loss] to our country and people" and blamed the [[cult of personality]] of Mao.

In particular, at the ''Seven Thousand Cadres Conference'' in January – February 1962, Mao made a [[self-criticism]] and re-affirmed his commitment to [[democratic centralism]]. In the years that followed, Mao mostly abstained from the operations of government, making policy largely the domain of Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping. Maoist ideology took a back seat in the Communist Party, until Mao launched the [[Cultural Revolution]] in 1966 which marked Mao's political comeback.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2072">'''Gross Rent Multiplier''' (GRM) is the ratio of the price of a [[real estate]] investment to its monthly rental income before accounting for expenses such as property taxes, insurance, and utilities; GRM is the number of years the property would take to pay for itself in gross received rent. For a prospective real estate investor, a lower GRM represents a better opportunity.
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.propertymetrics.com/blog/2014/02/06/gross-rent-multiplier/|title=Understanding the Gross Rent Multiplier in Commercial Real Estate|website=www.propertymetrics.com|access-date=2016-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The GRM is useful for comparing and selecting investment properties where depreciation effects, periodic costs (such as property taxes and insurance) and costs to the investor incurred by a potential renter (such as utilities and repairs) can be expected to be uniform across the properties (either as uniform values or uniform fractions of the gross rental income) or insignificant in comparison to gross rental income. As these costs are also often more difficult to predict than market rental return, the GRM serves as an alternative to a measure of net investment return where such a measure would be difficult to determine.

Example; $200,000 Sale Price / $20,000 gross annual rental income = 10

Today, it is quite common for GRM to be quoted by real estate professionals using annual rents rather than monthly rents.  A 100 GRM (monthly rents) = 8.33 GRM (annual rents).  An 8.33 GRM calculated on annual rents suggests the gross rent will pay for the property in 8.33 years.

The common measure of rental real estate value based on net return rather than gross rental income is the [[Capitalization Rate]] or [[Cap Rate]]. In contrast to the GRM, the Cap Rate is not a multiplier but a rate of annual return. A similar multiplier to the GRM derived from net return would be the multiplicative inverse of the Cap Rate.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fanniemae.com/content/guide_form/1025.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a member of the [[European People's Party]] (EPP) and the [[International Democrat Union]] (IDU).

==History==

It was founded in May 1993 by the right wing of the [[Sąjūdis|Reform Movement of Lithuania]], led by [[Vytautas Landsbergis]], who had led Lithuania to independence. In the [[Lithuanian parliamentary election, 1996|1996 national elections]], it secured 31.3% of the vote and returned 70 deputies to the [[Seimas]],&lt;ref name="eed.nsd.uib.no"&gt;http://eed.nsd.uib.no/webview/index.jsp?study=http%3A%2F%2F129.177.90.166%3A80%2Fobj%2FfStudy%2FLTPA1992_SUM_Display&amp;mode=cube&amp;v=2&amp;cube=http%3A%2F%2F129.177.90.166%3A80%2Fobj%2FfCube%2FLTPA1992_SUM_Display_C1&amp;top=yes&lt;/ref&gt; but, [[Lithuanian parliamentary election, 2000|in 2000]], it was reduced to 8.6% and 9 deputies.&lt;ref name="eed.nsd.uib.no"/&gt;

After Lithuania's admission to the [[European Union]] in 2004, it won two seats in the [[European Parliament Election, 2004 (Lithuania)|election to the]] [[European Parliament]], one of whom was [[Vytautas Landsbergis]], who sat in the [[EPP-ED]] Group.  At the [[Lithuanian parliamentary election, 2004|2004 election to the Seimas]], the party won 14.6% of the popular vote and 25 out of 141 seats.

Until the merger with [[Lithuanian Union of Political Prisoners and Deportees]] and [[Right Union of Lithuania]]), it was known just as ''Homeland Union (Lithuanian Conservatives)''.  The last change of the name was a result of the merger with the [[Lithuanian Nationalist Union]] on 11 March 2008, and the [[Lithuanian Christian Democrats]] on 17 May 2008, after which the ''Homeland Union – Lithuanian Christian Democrats'' became Lithuania's largest party with more than 18,000 members. Prior to 2008 it was known as the  '''Homeland Union (Conservatives, Political Prisoners and the Exiled, Christian Democrats)''' or '''TS'''.
At the [[Lithuanian parliamentary election, 2008|2008 legislative election]], Homeland Union won 19.69% of the national vote and 45 seats in the [[Seimas]]: 20 more than in 2004.  Becoming the largest party in the Seimas, it formed a coalition government with the [[Liberal Movement (Lithuania)|Liberal Movement]], [[Liberal and Centre Union]], and [[National Resurrection Party]].  Together, they held a majority of 80 out of 141 seats in the Seimas, and the Homeland Union's leader, [[Andrius Kubilius]], became [[Prime Minister of Lithuania|Prime Minister]] for a second time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meetdocs/2014_2019/documents/itre/dv/cv_andrius_kubilius_/cv_andrius_kubilius_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, the [[Lithuanian Nationalist Union]] declared its withdrawal from the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lrytas.lt/-13122094141310461482-tautininkai-lapkrit%C4%AF-planuoja-suva%C5%BEiavim%C4%85-sako-sub%C5%ABr%C4%99-apie-300-partijos-steig%C4%97j%C5%B3.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202044330/http://www.lrytas.lt/-13122094141310461482-tautininkai-lapkrit%C4%AF-planuoja-suva%C5%BEiavim%C4%85-sako-sub%C5%ABr%C4%99-apie-300-partijos-steig%C4%97j%C5%B3.htm |archivedate=2 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Support for the party plummeted in the 2012 election, and it was excluded from the government.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-19940043&lt;/ref&gt; It was credited to many unpopular decisions made during the time of government, and the unpopularity of the [[Andrius Kubilius]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.delfi.lt/news/daily/lithuania/reitingai-pirma-dgrybauskaite-paskutinis-akubilius.d?id=44774411&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Lithuanian parliamentary election, 2016|2016 legislative election]] party's support increased, but, due to failure to win more single-member seats in Seimas, number seats held felt to 31.

The '''International Consortium of Investigative Journalists''' ('''ICIJ''') is an independent [[Washington, D.C.|Washington D.C.]]-based international network.

The ICIJ's most recent investigation is the 2017 [[Paradise Papers]], a cross-border, global investigation&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.icij.org/blog/2017/971/icij-releases-paradise-papers/ global investigation]&lt;/ref&gt; that reveals the offshore activities of some of the world's most powerful people and companies.&lt;ref name="ICIJ_paradise"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.icij.org/blog/2017/971/icij-releases-paradise-papers/|title=ICIJ releases new investigation: the Paradise Papers|date=5 November 2017|work=International Consortium of Investigative Journalists|access-date=5 November 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project involved 95 media partners and was based on 13.4 million leaked files.

==History==
In 1997, the Center for Public Integrity began "assembling the world's first working network of premier investigative reporters." By 2000 the ICIJ consisted of 75 world-class investigative reporters in 39 countries."&lt;ref name="publicintegrity_2000"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.publicintegrity.org/files/manual/pdf/corporate/2000_CPI_Annual_Report.pdf | title=2000 Center for Public Integrity Annual Report | publisher=Center for Public Integrity | date=2000 | accessdate=7 April 2016 |pages=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11}}

In February 2017, ICIJ was spun off into a fully independent organisation, which is now governed by three committees: a traditional board of directors with a fiduciary role; an Advisory Committee made of supporters; and an ICIJ Network Committee.&lt;ref name="icij_about" /&gt;

ICIJ was granted nonprofit status from US tax authorities in July the same year.&lt;ref name="icij_about" /&gt;

In 2017, the ICIJ, [[the McClatchy Company]], and the [[Miami Herald]] won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Reporting]] "for the Panama Papers, a series of stories using a collaboration of more than 300 reporters on six continents to expose the hidden infrastructure and global scale of offshore tax havens."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Explanatory Reporting|url=http://www.pulitzer.org/prize-winners-by-category/207|accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, the ICIJ won more than 20 awards for the Panama Papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icij.org/about/awards/|title=ICIJ's Awards|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global tobacco industry==
From 2008 to 2011, the ICIJ investigated the global tobacco industry, revealing how [[Philip Morris International]] and other tobacco companies worked to grow businesses in Russia, Mexico, Uruguay and Indonesia.&lt;ref name=lethal_legal_2014&gt;{{cite book | title=Lethal But Legal: Corporations, Consumption, and Protecting Public Health | author=Freudenberg, Nicholas |isbn=9780199937196 |work=Oxford University Press |date=21 January 2014|pages=344}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|23}}

==Offshore banking series==
The ICIJ partnered with ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[BBC]], ''[[Le Monde]]'', the ''[[Washington Post]]'', ''[[SonntagsZeitung]]'', ''[[The Indian Express]]'', ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'' and ''[[Norddeutscher Rundfunk|NDR]]'' to produce an investigative series on [[offshore banking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Pitzke | first = Marc | title = Offshore Leaks: Vast Web of Tax Evasion Exposed | url = http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/icij-journalists-expose-mass-web-of-global-tax-evasion-a-892505.html

In June 2011, an ICIJ article revealed how an Australian businessman had helped his clients legally incorporate thousands of offshore shell entitles "some of which later became involved in the international movement of oil, guns and money."&lt;ref name="icij_2011_ryle_taylor"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.icij.org/offshore/geoffrey-taylor | title=Inside the shell: Drugs, arms and tax scams | publisher=ICIJ | date=28 June 2011 | accessdate=6 April 2016 | last=Ryle |first=Gerard |series=Secrecy for sale: inside the global offshore money maze}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2014, the ICIJ revealed that relatives of China's political and financial elite were among those using [[offshore tax havens]] to conceal wealth.&lt;ref name=ICIJJan21&gt;{{cite news|title=China's elite linked to secret offshore entities|url=http://www.icij.org/blog/2014/01/chinas-elite-linked-secret-offshore-entities|accessdate=January 21, 2014|newspaper=ICIJ|date=January 21, 2014|author=Gerard Ryle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Panama Papers===
{{Main|Panama Papers}}
[[File:Countries implicated in the Panama Papers.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Countries with politicians, public officials or close associates named in the leak on 15 April 2016]]
The ''Süddeutsche Zeitung'' received a leaked set of 11.5&amp;nbsp;million confidential documents from a secret source, created by the Panamanian corporate service provider [[Mossack Fonseca]].&lt;ref name="Center for Public Integrity"&gt;{{cite web|title=DocumentCloud 149 Results Source: Internal documents from Mossack Fonseca (Panama Papers) – Provider: Amazon Technologies / Owner: Perfect Privacy, LLC USA |url=https://www.documentcloud.org/public/search/Source:%20%22Internal%20documents%20from%20Mossack%20Fonseca%20(Panama%20Papers)%22/p3|publisher=Center for Public Integrity|accessdate=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The so-called [[Panama Papers]] provided detailed information on more than 214,000 [[offshore tax haven|offshore]] companies, including the identities of shareholders and directors which included government officials, close relatives and close associates of various heads of government of more than 40 other countries.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Power Players"/&gt; Because of the leak the prime minister of Iceland, Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson, was forced to resign on 5 April 2016.&lt;ref name="nyt_2016_april_6" /&gt; By 4 April 2016 more than "107 media organisations in 76 countries"&lt;ref name="BBC_2016_apr_07" /&gt; had participated in analyzing the documents,&lt;ref name="pbs_2016_apr_4"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/heres-what-we-know-so-far-about-the-leaked-panama-papers/ | title=Here's what we know so far about the leaked Panama papers | publisher=PBS | date=4 April 2016 | accessdate=6 April 2016 | author=Epatko, Larisa}}&lt;/ref&gt; including ''BBC Panorama'' and the UK newspaper, ''The Guardian''.&lt;ref name="BBC_2016_apr_07"&gt;{{citation | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-35983950 | title=Panama Papers: Government announces creation of 'panel of experts' | publisher=BBC | date=7 April 2016 | accessdate=7 April 2016| work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the Panama Paper disclosure, Pakistan Supreme Court constituted the Joint Investigation Team to probe the matter and disqualified the Prime Minister Nawas Sharif on July 28, 2017 to hold any public office for life.

The ICIJ and ''{{lang|de|[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]}}'' received the Panama Papers in 2015 and distributed them to about 400 journalists at 107 media organizations&lt;ref name="BBC_2016_apr_07" /&gt; in more than 80 countries.

According to ''[[The New York Times]]'',&lt;ref name="nyt_2016_april_6" /&gt;

{{quote|[T]he Panama Papers reveal an industry that flourishes in the gaps and holes of international finance. They make clear that policing offshore banking and tax havens and the rogues who use them cannot be done by any one country alone. Lost tax revenue is one consequence of this hidden system; even more dangerous is its deep damage to democratic rule and regional stability when corrupt politicians have a place to stash stolen national assets out of public view.}}

===Paradise Papers===
{{Main|Paradise Papers}}
[[File:Countries implicated in the Paradise Papers.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Countries with politicians, public officials or close associates named in the leak on 5 November 2017]]
In 2017, the German newspaper ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'' obtained a "cache" of "13.4 million leaked files"&lt;ref name="ICIJ_paradise"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT_2017"/&gt; regarding [[tax havens]], known as the Paradise Papers, related to the Bermuda-based offshore specialist [[Appleby (law firm)|Appleby]], "one of the world's largest offshore law firms." The files were shared them with the ICIJ and eventually 95 media outlets."&lt;ref name="NYT_2017"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/05/world/wilbur-ross-russia.html|title=Commerce Secretary's Offshore Ties to Putin 'Cronies'|last=McIntire|first=Mike|date=November 5, 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=November 5, 2017|last2=Chavkin|first2=Sasha|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|last3=Hamilton|first3=Martha M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; They revealed that many of the tax havens used by Appleby are in the Cayman Islands, which is a British territory that "levies no corporate or personal income tax on money earned outside its jurisdiction."&lt;ref name="NYT_2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT_2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="politico_paradise"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2017/11/05/trump-paradise-papers-finance-244577|title='Paradise Papers' documents touch Trump administration|work=POLITICO|access-date=November 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Paradise Papers revealed the "offshore activities of some of the world's most powerful people and companies".&lt;ref name="ICIJ_paradise"/&gt;

== Data journalism ==
In the course of the Panama Papers and Paradise Papers investigations, ICIJ was challenged to learn about and implement various technologies to manage international collaboration on terabytes of data - structured and unstructured (e.g. emails, PDFs) - and how to extract meaningful information from this data. Among the technologies used were the [[Neo4j|Neo4J]] graphic database management systems and [[Linkurious]] to search and visualize the data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/swedish-database-startup-neo4j-cracked-paradise-papers-2017-11|title=How a nerdy Swedish database startup with $80m in funding cracked the Paradise Papers|last=Ghosh|first=Shona|date=2017-11-08|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The data-intensive projects involved not just veteran investigative journalists, but also demanded [[Data journalism|data journalists]] and programmers.

==Outreach==

The ICIJ is active on social media with a website, a blog entitled the 'Global Muckraker, '&lt;ref name=ICIJ_blog&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icij.org/blog|title=The Global Muckraker|work=International Consortium of Investigative Journalists}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and a YouTube channel.&lt;ref name="ICIJ_about_2016"/&gt;

==Awards==
The ICIJ organized the bi-annual ''[[Daniel Pearl]] Awards for Outstanding International Investigative Reporting''. The award is currently not being awarded.&lt;ref name=icij_about /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT_2006"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/21/opinion/21Wed3.html | title=Razzle-Dazzle 'Em Ethics Reform | newspaper=New York Times | date=26 June 2016 | accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AP_1996_"&gt;{{cite news|last=Galvin|first=Kevin|title=Buchanan Campaign Chief Has Military Ties|agency=Associated Press |date=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT_2012" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Goldstein|first=Steve|title=`Outsider' Runs Filled With `Insider' Advisers|url=http://articles.philly.com/1996-02-16/news/25655765_1_larry-pratt-insider-advisers-outsider|accessdate=19 June 2013|newspaper=Philadelphia Inquirer|date=1996-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FAQ&gt;{{Cite web  | title = Frequently Asked Questions  | url = http://www.iwatchnews.org/about/our-organization/frequently-asked-questions | work = Center for Public Integrity  | accessdate = 2012-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT_2012"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/20/opinion/the-states-get-a-poor-report-card.html | title=The States Get a Poor Report Card | newspaper=New York Times | date=19 March 2012 | accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Intrusion tolerance''' is a [[fault-tolerant design]] approach to defending information systems against malicious attack. Abandoning the conventional aim of preventing all intrusions, intrusion tolerance instead calls for triggering mechanisms that prevent intrusions from leading to a system security failure.

The '''Kraljevo massacre''' was the [[mass murder]] of approximately 2,000 residents of the central Serbian city of [[Kraljevo]] by the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' between 15 and 20 October 1941, during [[World War II]]. The massacre came in reprisal for a joint [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisan]]–[[Chetniks|Chetnik]] attack on a German garrison in which 10 German soldiers were killed and 14 wounded. The number of hostages to be shot was calculated based on a ratio of 100&amp;nbsp;hostages executed for every German soldier killed and 50&amp;nbsp;hostages executed for every German soldier wounded, a formula devised by [[Adolf Hitler]] with the intent of suppressing anti-Nazi resistance in Eastern Europe.

The ''Wehrmacht'' initially responded by rounding up and executing 300 Serbian civilians, described in contemporary documents as "communists, nationalists, democrats and [[Jews]]." Over the following several days, all men between the ages of 14 and 60 were arrested and herded into a makeshift detention centre at the local [[Rolling stock|rolling-stock]] factory. Once there, their papers were checked and their names entered into a ledger. When the camp was full, the ''Wehrmacht'' ordered groups of 100 prisoners to march to pre-dug mass graves, where they were executed with heavy [[machine gun]]s. The bodies were then examined for any signs of life; victims that had survived the initial volley were dealt a single bullet to the head. Once the first group had been liquidated, the soldiers returned to the factory and collected the next 100 victims. This process continued until all the men that were rounded up had been killed. The reprisals lasted several days. Following the shooting of hostages from the rolling-stock factory, the ''Wehrmacht'' deployed through the surrounding villages, burning homes and killing indiscriminately. According to the 717th Infantry Division's own records, 1,736&amp;nbsp;men and 19&amp;nbsp;"communist" women from the city and its outskirts were executed, despite attempts by local collaborationists to mitigate the punishment. Twenty members of the 717th Infantry Division were later conferred [[Iron Cross]]es for their role in the killings.

The massacre at Kraljevo, as well as a similar and nearly concurrent [[Kragujevac massacre|massacre]] in nearby [[Kragujevac]], convinced German commanders that mass killings of Serbian hostages were not only ineffectual but also counterproductive, as they drove locals into the hands of insurgents and sometimes resulted in the deaths of factory workers contributing to the German [[war effort]]. Following the war, several senior German military officials were tried and convicted for their involvement in the reprisal shootings at the [[Nuremberg Trials]] and the [[Subsequent Nuremberg trials]].

==Background==
Following the 1938 ''[[Anschluss]]'' between [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and [[First Austrian Republic|Austria]], Yugoslavia came to share its northwestern border with the Third Reich and fell under increasing pressure as her neighbours aligned themselves with the [[Axis powers]]. In April 1939, Italy opened a second frontier with Yugoslavia when it [[Italian invasion of Albania|invaded]] and occupied neighbouring [[Albanian Kingdom (1928–39)|Albania]].{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=6–7}} At the outbreak of World War&amp;nbsp;II, the Yugoslav government declared its [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]].{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=8}} Between September and November 1940, [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–46)|Hungary]] and [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] joined the [[Tripartite Pact]], aligning themselves with the Axis, and Italy [[Greco-Italian War|invaded Greece]]. From then, Yugoslavia was almost surrounded by the Axis powers and their satellites, and her neutral stance toward the war became strained.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=6–7}} In late February 1941, [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] joined the Pact. The following day, German troops entered Bulgaria from Romania, closing the ring around Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=12}} Intending to secure his southern flank for the [[Operation Barbarossa|impending attack]] on the [[Soviet Union]], [[Adolf Hitler]] began placing heavy pressure on Yugoslavia to join the Axis. On 25&amp;nbsp;March 1941, after some delay, the Yugoslav government conditionally signed the Pact. Two days later, a group of pro-Western, [[Serbian nationalism|Serbian nationalist]] [[Royal Yugoslav Air Force]] officers deposed the country's [[regent]], [[Prince Paul of Yugoslavia|Prince Paul]], in a bloodless [[Yugoslav coup d'état|coup d'état]], placed his teenaged nephew [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|Peter]] on the throne, and brought to power a "government of national unity" led by the head of the Royal Yugoslav Air Force, General [[Dušan Simović]].{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=10–13}} The coup enraged Hitler, who immediately ordered the country's [[invasion of Yugoslavia|invasion]], which commenced on 6&amp;nbsp;April 1941.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=15}}

[[File:Territory Of The German Military Commander In Serbia 1941-44.png|thumb|right|250px|alt=Wartime map of Serbia|Map of German-occupied Serbia]]
Yugoslavia was overwhelmed by the combined strength of the Axis powers and surrendered in less than two weeks. The government and royal family went into exile, and the country was occupied and dismembered by its neighbours. The [[Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia|German-occupied territory of Serbia]] was limited to the pre-[[Balkan Wars|Balkan War]] borders of the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] and was directly occupied by the Germans for the key rail and riverine transport routes that passed through it, as well as its valuable resources, particularly [[non-ferrous metals]].{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=49}} The occupied territory covered about {{convert|51,000|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} and had a population of 3.8&amp;nbsp;million. Hitler had briefly considered erasing all existence of a Serbian state, but this was quickly abandoned and the Germans began searching for a [[Serbs|Serb]] suitable to lead a puppet government in Belgrade.{{sfn|Ramet|Lazić|2011|pp=19–20}} They initially settled on [[Milan Aćimović]], a staunch anti-communist who served as Yugoslavia's [[Ministry of the Interior (Yugoslavia)|Minister of Internal Affairs]] during the winter of 1939–1940.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|pp=177–178}}

Two resistance movements emerged following the invasion: the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|communist]]-led, multi-ethnic [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]], and the royalist, Serbian nationalist [[Chetniks]], although during 1941, within the occupied territory, even the Partisans consisted almost entirely of Serbs. The Partisans were led by the [[President of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia|General Secretary of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] [[Josip Broz Tito]], while the Chetniks were led by [[Colonel]] [[Draža Mihailović]], an officer in the interwar [[Royal Yugoslav Army]]. The two movements had widely diverging goals. Whereas the Partisans sought to turn Yugoslavia into a communist state under Tito's leadership, the Chetniks sought a return to the pre-war ''[[status quo]]'', whereby the Yugoslav monarchy—and, by extension, Serb political hegemony—would be restored.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=59–60}} Communist resistance commenced in early July, shortly after the invasion of the Soviet Union, targeting both the Germans and the puppet authorities.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|pp=177–178}} By late August 1941, the Partisans and Chetniks were carrying out joint attacks against the Germans.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=59–60}} The Partisans were well organised and many of their commanders had ample military experience, having fought in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. By late summer, they had 8,000&amp;nbsp;fighters spread across 21&amp;nbsp;[[detachment (military)|detachment]]s in Serbia alone.{{sfn|Shepherd|2016|p=198}} Many Chetniks were either veterans of the Balkan Wars and World War&amp;nbsp;I or former members of the Royal Yugoslav Army.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=118–123}} They boasted around 20,000&amp;nbsp;fighters in the German-occupied territory of Serbia at the time of the massacre.{{sfn|Lampe|2000|p=217}}

==Prelude==
{{main|Uprising in Serbia (1941)}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H30220, Wilhelm Keitel.jpg|thumb|''Generalfeldmarschall'' Wilhelm Keitel issued Hitler's order regarding the ratio of hostages to be shot.|alt=a black and white image of a man in uniform]] 
On 29&amp;nbsp;August, the Germans replaced Aćimović with Yugoslavia's former [[Ministry of Defense (Yugoslavia)|Minister of the Army and Navy]] and [[Chief of the General Staff (Yugoslavia)|Chief of the General Staff]], [[General (rank)|General]] [[Milan Nedić]], another fervent anti-communist, who formed a [[Government of National Salvation|new puppet government]].{{sfn|Ramet|Lazić|2011|p=22}} Nedić's inability to crush the Partisans and Chetniks prompted the Military Commander in Serbia to request German reinforcements from other parts of the continent.{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|p=28}} In mid-September, they transferred the 125th Infantry Regiment from Greece and the [[342nd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|342nd Infantry Division]] from France to help put down the uprising in Serbia. On 16&amp;nbsp;September, Hitler issued Directive No.&amp;nbsp;312 to ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'' ([[Field Marshal]]) [[Wilhelm List]], the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' commander in Southeast Europe, ordering him to suppress all resistance in that part of the continent. That same day, the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|Supreme Command of the Armed Forces]] (''Oberkommando der Wehrmacht''; OKW) issued Hitler's order on the suppression of "Communist Armed Resistance Movements in the Occupied Areas", signed by ''Generalfeldmarschall'' [[Wilhelm Keitel]].{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=146}} This decree specified that all attacks against the Germans on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] were to be "regarded as being of communist origin", and that 100&amp;nbsp;hostages were to be shot for every German soldier killed and 50&amp;nbsp;were to be shot for every German soldier wounded.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=140}}{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=61}} It was intended to apply to all of [[Eastern Europe]], though an identical policy had already been implemented in Serbia as early as 28&amp;nbsp;April 1941, aimed at deterring guerrilla attacks. Attacks against the Germans increased during the spring and summer, and Serbia once again became a warzone. German troops fanned through the countryside burning villages, taking hostages and establishing concentration camps. The first mass executions of hostages commenced in July.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=61}}

The strengthening of Germany's military presence in Serbia resulted in a new wave of mass executions and [[war crime]]s. The commanders who bore the most responsibility for these atrocities were primarily of Austrian origin and had served in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] during [[World War I]].{{sfn|Lampe|2000|p=215}} Most were ardently [[Anti-Serb sentiment|anti-Serb]], a prejudice that the historian [[Stevan K. Pavlowitch]] links to the Nazis' wider anti-[[Slavs|Slavic]] racism.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=60–61}}

On 19&amp;nbsp;September, ''[[General der Gebirgstruppe]]'' ([[Lieutenant General]]) [[Franz Böhme]] was appointed as Plenipotentiary Commanding General in Serbia, with direct responsibility for quelling the revolt, bringing with him the staff of [[XVIII Army Corps (Wehrmacht)|XVIII&amp;nbsp;Mountain Corps]]. He was allocated additional forces to assist him in doing so, reinforcing the three German occupation divisions already in the territory.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=97–98}} These divisions were the [[104th Jäger Division (Wehrmacht)|704th Infantry Division]], [[114th Jäger Division (Wehrmacht)|714th Infantry Division]] and [[117th Jäger Division (Wehrmacht)|717th Infantry Division]].{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=96}} Böhme boasted a profound hatred of Serbs and encouraged his predominantly Austrian-born troops to exact "vengeance" against them. His primary grievances were the [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] and subsequent Austro-Hungarian military defeats at the hands of the [[Royal Serbian Army]], which he thought could only be rectified by the reprisal shooting of Serbian civilians.{{sfn|Shepherd|2016|p=199}} "In Serbia," he wrote, "it is necessary, on the basis of the Balkan mentality and the great expansion of insurgent movements&amp;nbsp;... to carry out the orders of the OKW in the most severe form."{{sfn|Nuremberg Military Tribunals|1950|p=977}}

==Killings==
[[Kraljevo]] is a city located about {{convert|150|km}} south of [[Belgrade]].{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=62}} At the time of the massacre, it was situated along a vital transport route and was the seat of a German divisional command.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=198}} In mid-October 1941,{{efn|[[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] historian [[Christopher Browning]] writes that the incident occurred on 15–16&amp;nbsp;October,{{sfn|Browning|2007|p=343}} while journalist [[Misha Glenny]] gives the date as 17&amp;nbsp;October.{{sfn|Glenny|2001|p=490}}}} the Partisans and Chetniks laid siege to a 2,200-strong German garrison in the city.{{sfn|Glenny|2001|p=490}} Ten German soldiers were killed and 14&amp;nbsp;wounded in the attack.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=62}} "Not only will 100&amp;nbsp;Serbs be shot for each German," the garrison commander declared, "their families and property will also be destroyed."{{sfn|Benz|2006|p=206}} He then gave orders for the arrest and summary execution of 300&amp;nbsp;Serbian civilians.{{sfn|Glenny|2001|p=490}} His orders were promptly carried out.{{sfn|Shepherd|2012|loc=p. 306, note 109}} The victims were described in contemporary German military documents as "communists, nationalists, democrats and Jews".{{sfn|Manoschek|2000|p=176}}

New orders were subsequently issued demanding further executions. According to eyewitness accounts, the ''Wehrmacht'' went from house to house over the next several days, arresting all males between the ages of 14 and 60. They were herded into a makeshift detention centre at a former [[Rolling stock|rolling-stock]] factory.{{sfn|Glenny|2001|p=490}}{{efn|The Germans had dismantled the factory in August 1941 and expropriated its machinery and materials, shipping them off to the Reich for use in German factories.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|pp=624–625}}}} Once there, their papers were checked and their names entered into a ledger. When the camp was full, the ''Wehrmacht'' ordered groups of 100 prisoners to march to pre-dug mass graves, where they were executed with heavy [[machine gun]]s. The bodies were then examined for any signs of life; victims that had survived the initial volley were dealt a single bullet to the head.{{sfn|Glenny|2001|p=490}} Once the first group had been liquidated, the soldiers returned to the factory and collected the next 100 victims. This process continued until all the men that were rounded up had been killed.{{sfn|Glenny|2001|p=491}}

The reprisals lasted several days. Following the shooting of hostages from the rolling-stock factory, the ''Wehrmacht'' deployed through the surrounding villages, burning homes and killing indiscriminately.{{sfn|Glenny|2001|p=491}} According to the 717th Infantry Division's own records, by 17&amp;nbsp;or 20&amp;nbsp;October,{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=62}}{{sfn|Browning|2007|p=343}} 1,736&amp;nbsp;men and 19&amp;nbsp;"communist" women from the city and its outskirts had been shot.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|loc=p. 146, note 92}}{{sfn|Mojzes|2011|p=86}}{{sfn|Levene|2013|p=84}} The executions were carried out despite attempts by local collaborationists to mitigate the punishment.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=62}} Most of those killed were ethnic Serbs, though 80&amp;nbsp;[[Romani people|Roma]] (Gypsies) were also among the victims,{{sfn|Mojzes|2011|p=100}} as were some Jews,{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=587}}{{sfn|Prusin|2017|p=97}} and several dozen Slovene refugees.{{sfn|Prusin|2017|p=97}} Among the dead was the entire Serbian workforce of an airplane factory producing armaments for the Germans.{{sfn|Mazower|2004|p=154}}{{sfn|Browning|2007|p=344}} The factory workers had been interned on suspicion of sabotage.{{sfn|Prusin|2017|p=97}} Forty members of the collaborationist [[Serbian Volunteer Corps (World War II)|Serbian Volunteer Command]] were inadvertently killed.{{sfn|Manoschek|1995|p=165}} ''[[Generalmajor]]'' ([[Brigadier general|Brigadier General]]) [[Paul Hoffmann (general)|Paul Hoffman]], the commander of the 717th Infantry Division, personally oversaw the reprisals and praised his men for their "enthusiastic fulfillment of what was required of them".{{sfn|Shepherd|2012|p=140}} Another officer lauded his men for demonstrating "great bravery in action".{{sfn|Lebel|2007|p=317}} Twenty members of the 717th Infantry Division were later conferred the [[Iron Cross]], 2nd Class for their role in the massacre.{{sfn|Glenny|2001|p=491}}

==Aftermath and legacy==
[[File:Spomenik otpora i stradanja Kraljevo.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A monument in Kraljevo commemorating the massacre]]
The massacre at Kraljevo, as well as a similar and nearly concurrent [[Kragujevac massacre|massacre]] in nearby [[Kragujevac]], was met with outrage by the Serbian puppet government, which responded with pleas, interventions and threats of resignation. The killings led German military commanders in Serbia to question the efficacy of mass reprisal shootings, as they pushed thousands of Serbs into the hands of anti-German guerrillas. The killing of airplane factory workers in Kraljevo convinced the OKW that arbitrary shootings of Serbs not only incurred a significant political cost but were also counterproductive.{{sfn|Browning|2007|p=344}} The ratio of 100&amp;nbsp;executions for one soldier killed and 50&amp;nbsp;executions for one soldier wounded was reduced by half in February 1943, and removed altogether that autumn. Henceforth, each individual execution had to be approved by Special Envoy [[Hermann Neubacher]].{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=69}}

The killings exacerbated tensions between the Partisans and Chetniks.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=62}} They also convinced Mihailović that active resistance was futile for as long as the Germans held an unassailable military advantage in the Balkans, and that killing German troops would only result in the unnecessary deaths of tens of thousands of Serbs. He therefore decided to scale back Chetnik guerrilla attacks and wait for an Allied landing in the Balkans.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=146}}{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|p=31}}{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=63}}

List and Böhme were both captured at the end of the war. On 10&amp;nbsp;May 1947, they were charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity as part of the [[Hostages Trial]] of the [[Subsequent Nuremberg trials]].{{sfn|Nuremberg Military Tribunals|1950|p=759}} One of the crimes specifically listed in Count&amp;nbsp;1 of the indictment was the massacre of 2,300&amp;nbsp;hostages in Kragujevac.{{sfn|Nuremberg Military Tribunals|1950|p=767}} Böhme committed suicide before his [[arraignment]].{{sfn|Nuremberg Military Tribunals|1950|p=759}} List was found guilty on Count&amp;nbsp;1, as well as on another count.{{sfn|Nuremberg Military Tribunals|1950|p=1274}} He was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] in 1948,{{sfn|Nuremberg Military Tribunals|1950|p=1318}} but was released due to ill health in 1953.

In [[common law]] and [[statutory law]], a '''life estate''' is the ownership of land for the duration of a person's life.  In legal terms, it is an [[estate (law)|estate]] in [[real property]] that ends at death when ownership of the property may revert to the original owner, or it may pass to another person.  The owner of a life estate is called a "life tenant".

In the combined jurisdiction of England and Wales [[Law of Property Act 1925|since 1925]] a freehold estate intended to be 'held' as a life interest takes effect only as an interest enjoyed in equity, specifically as an [[interest in possession trust]].  The other type of land ownership is leasehold and although most long leases are for a period of between 99 and [[999 year lease|999 years]] 'leases for life' will be interpreted in often unpredictable ways as either as a licence or a lease.

==Principles==
{{refimprove|date = July 2015}}
The ownership of a life estate is of limited duration because it ends at the death of a person. Its owner is the '''life tenant''' (typically also the 'measuring life') and it carries with it right to enjoy certain benefits of ownership of the property, chiefly income derived from rent or other uses of the property and the right of occupation, during his or her possession.  Because a life estate ceases to exist at the death of the measuring person's life, the life tenant, a temporary owner, may short-term let but cannot sell, give or bequeath the property indefinitely (including assuming it could pass to [[heir]]s ([[intestate]]) or creating a purported document leaving it to [[devisee]]s ([[testate]]).

A life estate ''[[pur autre vie]]'' ([[Law French]], "for the life of another") is held for the rest of the lifetime of a person who does not hold the estate.  This form of life estate arises where a life tenant has disposed of the property, assuming such a disposal does not trigger any special forfeiture under the life interest instrument.  It also arises where the grantor chooses to make the measuring life that of someone other than the life tenant's life. A life estate ''pur autre vie'' is most commonly created in one of two circumstances.
*First, when the owner of property conveys his interest in that property to another person, for the life of a third person. For example, if A conveys land to B during the life of C, then B owns the land for as long as C lives; if B dies before C, B's heirs will inherit the land, and will continue to own it for as long as C lives.
*Second, if A conveys land to C for life, C can then sell the life estate to B. Again, B and B's heirs will own the land for as long as C lives.
*In either scenario, once C dies, the ownership of the land will revert to A. If A has died, ownership will revert to A's heirs. The right to succeed to ownership of the property upon the expiration of the life estate is called a ''remainder''.  The remainder interest may be granted to a third party (A to B for life, with a remainder interest in C), or it may remain with the grantor.

A clear distinction should be made with an [[leasehold estate|estate for (a) term of years]], interpreted as lease or licence.

At death, assuming no mis-dealings to certain innocent purchasers, the property involved in a life estate falls into the ownership of the [[remainderman]] ({{abbreviation|pl.|plural}} ''remaindermen'') or reverts to its grantor (all of which confusingly can be called 'reversions' and 'reversioners').  There is a small market for reversions in real estate, which necessitates a buyer to carry out enhanced documentary due diligence and physical checks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mortgageintroducer.com/blogengine/post/Home-reversions-and-their-place-in-the-market.aspx Home Reversions and their place in the market] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150325212949/http://mortgageintroducer.com/blogengine/post/Home-reversions-and-their-place-in-the-market.aspx |date=2015-03-25 }} Chris Prior. ''Mortgage Introducer'' 18 February 2014.  Retrieved 2015-03-12&lt;/ref&gt;

A land owner of an estate cannot give a "greater interest" in the estate than he or she owns.  That is, a life estate owner cannot give complete and indefinite ownership ([[fee simple]]) to another person because the life tenant's ownership in the property ends when the person who is the measuring life dies. For instance, if Ashley conveyed to Bob for the life of Bob, and Bob conveys a life estate to another person, Charlie, for Charlie's life [an embedded life estate], then Charlie's life estate interest would last only until Charlie or Bob dies. Charlie's life interest or ''pur autre vie'' interest (interest for the life of another, whichever has applied) and most often the remaining rights of ownership in the property (the 'reversionary interest') devolve to the persons under the terms of the will/rules of intestacy/declaration of trust/trust deed (UK) or will/rules of intestacy/'grant or deed of life interest' (or similar) (U.S.) in remainder or revert to the original grantee, depending on terms of Ashley. Such a life estate in the U.S. can also be conveyed for the life of the grantor, such as "A conveys X to B until A dies" and in the UK by trust transferring upon trust or assigning rather than conveying X.

If a life tenant purports to transfer the underlying 'reversionary' interest, which a life tenant never has, this constitutes an actionable breach of trust for damages and may constitute criminal [[fraud]] however may not entitle the ultimate reversioner (or substituted beneficiaries) to be able to obtain a court declaration that the property is their own if that property is in the hands of an innocent purchaser for value without notice ([[bona fide purchaser]]).

Financial and physical responsibility falls to the life tenant under the legal doctrine of [[waste (law)|waste]], which prohibits life tenants from damaging or devaluing the asset.  In short, as the life tenant's ownership is temporary, failing to maintain or reasonably protect the asset resulting in its diminution in value, or indeed, destruction constitutes a cause of action for the reversioner.

A further limitation is the [[rule against perpetuities]] in many states and countries which prohibits long-running pre-19th-century style successions of life tenancies and may result in the premature and compensation-entitling termination of such successive life interests.  In England and Wales this is fixed at one lifetime, or 80 years whichever is longer.

Selling property while keeping a life estate is commonly known in France as "'''viager'''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-33326787|title=The deal to sell your home and get paid to stay|last=Williamson|first=Lucy|date=2015-07-01|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=1 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it is used more often than elsewhere, most famously in the case of [[Jeanne Calment]] the longest lived human ever recorded.

==Uses of a life estate==
In the United States, a life estate is typically used as a tool of an estate planning. A life estate can avoid [[probate]] and ensure that an intended heir will receive title to real property. For example, Al owns a home and desires that Bill inherit it after Al's death. Al can effectuate that desire by transferring title to the home to Bill and retaining a life estate in the home. Al keeps a life estate and Bill receives a vested fee simple remainder. As soon as Al dies, the life estate interest merges with Bill's remainder, and Bill has a fee simple title. An advantage of such a transfer is that it makes the use of a will unnecessary and eliminates the need to probate the asset. A disadvantage is the small risk of a fraud on the part of beneficiary Bill, if he could easily show in a particular jurisdiction an unfettered fee simple, he could sell the estate prematurely to an [[bona fide purchaser|innocent purchaser]] such as when Al is on vacation. A second disadvantage to the grantor is that provision for any remainderman (or men) (party C) is irrevocable without the remainderman's consent. "Beneficiary deeds" have been statutorily created in some states to address this issue.

The intestacy laws of certain American states, such as [http://www.mystatewill.com/states/AR/ARintcalc.htm Arkansas], [http://www.mystatewill.com/states/DE/DEintcalc.htm Delaware], and [http://www.mystatewill.com/states/RI/RIintcalc.htm Rhode Island] limit the surviving spouse's rights (inheritance) to the deceased spouse's real estate to a life estate.  [[Louisiana]] applying an itemised ([[civil law (legal system)|civil law]]) code has alike default provisions for succession, called [[usufruct]].

The intestacy laws of England and Wales from 1 October 2014 provide for £250,000 (or the whole non-joint estate if less) and 50% of any excess to the spouse, remainder to adult children.  This abolished the remaining 50% being enjoyed as a life interest which had applied from the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/sep/20/wills-inheritance-changes-intestacy-rules "Family Finances: Wills and inheritance: how changes to the intestacy rules affect you"] Jill Papworth and Patrick Collinson.  Retrieved 2015-03-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The surviving spouse (and rarely, others) benefit from [[concurrent estate|survivorship]] of any joint property.

The arrangement in the first paragraph would in the UK be interpreted as an interest in possession trust and is usually avoided as for inheritance tax is considered 'reservation of benefit' requiring fully backdated sums of annual income tax on whatever market rent ought to have been paid to the legal owner, in England and Wales for continued enjoyment of the asset.&lt;ref name=tcgt/&gt;

==Duration of a life estate==
Life estates are measured either by the life of the property recipient (''pur sa vie''), or by the life of some other person (''pur autre vie'').

==Validity of a life estate==
{{see also|Equity (law)|Maxims of equity}}

===At law and in equity (US)===
Life estates in real estate are still created today. The life estate is more commonly used in [[trust (property)|trust]] instruments, typically in an attempt to minimize the effect of the [[inheritance tax]] or other taxes on transfers of wealth.  A prospective reduction in tax for the creator ('settlor') often follows if the settlor has parted with all current and [[future interest]].  However many tax codes transfer the burden of estate taxes to the holder of the [[interest in possession trust|interest in possession]] (life tenant) and may treat that person or the remaindermen as owning a second/surplus property.&lt;ref name=tcgt&gt;[http://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/323723/hs294.pdf Trust and Capital Gains Tax] UK tax authority (HMRC). Retrieved 2015-03-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Formally where a system is derived from English law, the law divides into common law and equitable law &amp;mdash; at their cores the formal title and further overarching rules (especially as to trust interests such as this).  The latter cannot usually defeat a claim to title from a [[bona fide purchaser]] for value without notice, as such a person has reasonably researched the ownership position based upon the legal title (common law) position.  As the owner of a legal interest, in the US, further embedded or legal interests consistent with the form of ownership can be created from life estates.

Accordingly, due to their potential versatility and complexity in the U.S., common law seldom recognizes a life estate in personal property (tangible items and livestock other than land including buildings) but such interests are recognized at equity where of adequate form &amp;mdash; statutes and regulations impose formalities on the creation of lifetime interests in personalty.

===At equity (England and Wales)===
Since 1925 registered titles in England and Wales preferably should, but mostly do not, reveal an 'interest for life', 'life estate' or  'life tenancy' in the form of a restriction on the register. Instead the registered legal owner may hold various degrees of leasehold or freehold interest, but usually absolute interest. This provides a reliable 'mirror of title' which can only be subjected to a very few [[overriding interests]].  A maxim of equity is 'Where equities are equal, the law will prevail'. Equity defers to the position at law of a ''bona fide'' purchaser for value without notice (including any tenant or mortgagee), and as 'equity will not suffer a wrong to be without remedy,'{{fact|date=January 2016}} where there is such, will be limited to ''[[in personam]]'' remedies against the settlor or life tenant where it confirms life estates, upon trust, to have been validly created:
#for the life tenant(s); and thereafter
#for remainderman, remaindermen or the reversionary settlor.

Life tenants are never recorded as proprietors at the [[HM Land Registry|Land Registry]] as they are temporary, equitable owners and are not entitled to have the a transfer of the land effected. If the proprietor has died, executors of the will, administrators or beneficiaries all have the right to apply for the standard form A restriction and are encouraged by the official guidance to do so.&lt;ref name=pg&gt;[http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/private-trusts-of-land/practice-guide-24-private-trusts-of-land#the-standard-form-restrictions  Practice Guide 24, published 13 October 2003.] [[HM Land Registry|Land Registry]]. Retrieved 2015-03-12&lt;/ref&gt;

If a lease is for more than seven years, the lease must be registered.&lt;ref name=pg/&gt; Most long leases are for a period of between 99 and [[999 year lease|999 years]], and 'leases for life' will be interpreted either as a licence or a lease.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.privateclientadviser.co.uk/blog/wagstaff-and-definition-settled-property-cgt-purposes "Wagstaff and the definition of settled property for CGT purposes"] 27 March 2014. Fiona Graham and William Hadley. Private Client Advisor. Retrieved 2015-03-12.&lt;/ref&gt;
===Torrens Title jurisdictions===
In most [[Torrens Title]] [[jurisdiction]]s a life tenant has, like in [[United Kingdom|UK]] and [[United States of America|US]], the right  to possession and enjoyment of the [[real estate|property]], but once the tenant dies the property will return to the [[remainerman|remainderman]].&lt;ref&gt;Edgeworth et all, Sackville and Neave's Property Law Cases and Materials, 8th edition, Lexis Nexis, 2008, pp. 200-205.&lt;/ref&gt; The main difference is that, the life estate  will be registered by the [[General Register Office#Examples|Registrar general]] of that jurisdiction, and will appear on the [[registered title]]. This has the effect of making them &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teece.com.au/files/life_estates_guide.pdf  Estate Planning and Trusts].&lt;/ref&gt; one of the 9 types of recognised  interest in land, and one of the four that confirm possession. The registration process in Torrens title systems usually confers [[Defeasible estate|indefeasibility]] on the life estate.&lt;ref&gt;see ''[[Frazer v Walker]]'' [1967] AC 569.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see ''Bogdanovic v Koteff'' (1988) 12 NSWLR 472. &lt;/ref&gt;

A holder of a life estate can [[alienation (property law)|alienate]] his rights, but they will still expire on his death, regardless of who he alienates it to. At that point, that buyer will have to forfeit the land.

demand justice for [[Alexander Litvinenko]] who [[Alexander Litvinenko poisoning|was allegedly poisoned]] in [[London]], [[United Kingdom]] on November 1, 2006.

According to organizers, they will do “everything possible to make sure that suspects will stand trial in the U.K. and will not be shielded from justice by the Russian state.” &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/03/world/europe/03cnd-spy.html Foundation Set Up to Seek Justice for Ex-K.G.B.

The Litvinenko Justice Foundation was founded by [[Alexander Litvinenko]]'s widow, Marina, and his two friends, [[Boris Berezovsky (businessman)|Boris Berezovsky]] and [[Alexander Goldfarb (microbiologist)|Alex Goldfarb]]. They were joined by a prominent human rights lawyer [[Louise Christian]].

The Foundation was registered in London, United Kingdom on 2 March 2007. Initial funding was provided by Boris Berezovsky [http://en.rian.ru/world/20070405/63175922.html].

After Marina Litvinenko was granted an [[inquest]] into the death of her husband in October 2011, the Foundation launched a public fundraising campaign to help her offset her legal costs. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15334401 Litvinenko's widow appeals for inquest funding.][[BBC News]], 17 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3375">In [[social choice theory]], '''May's theorem''' states that [[simple majority voting]] is the only anonymous, neutral, and positively responsive social choice function between two alternatives. Further, this procedure is resolute{{clarify|date=September 2018}} when there are an odd number of voters and ties (indecision) are not allowed. [[Kenneth May]] first published this theory in 1952.{{ref|May}}

Various modifications have been suggested by others since the original publication. Mark Fey{{ref|Fey}} extended the proof to an infinite number of voters. Robert Goodin and Christian List showed that, among methods of aggregating first-preference votes over multiple alternatives, plurality rule uniquely satisfies May's conditions; under approval balloting, a similar statement can be made about approval voting.{{ref|List}}

[[Arrow's theorem]] in particular does not apply to the case of two candidates, so this possibility result can be seen as a mirror analogue of that theorem. (Note that anonymity is a stronger form of non-dictatorship.)

Another way of explaining the fact that simple majority voting can successfully deal with at most two alternatives is to cite Nakamura's theorem.
The theorem states that the number of alternatives that a rule can deal with successfully is less than the [[Nakamura number]] of the rule.
The Nakamura number of simple majority voting is 3, except in the case of four voters.
Supermajority rules may have greater Nakamura numbers.

==Formal statement==
*Condition 1. The group decision function sends each set of preferences to a unique winner. (resolute, unrestricted domain)
*Condition 2. The group decision function treats each voter identically. (anonymity)
*Condition 3. The group decision function treats both outcomes the same, in that reversing each set of preferences reverses the group preference. (neutrality)
*Condition 4. If the group decision was 0 or 1 and a voter raises a vote from −1 to 0 or 1 or from 0 to 1, the group decision is 1. (positive responsiveness)

''Theorem:'' A group decision function with an odd number of voters meets conditions 1, 2, 3, and 4 [[if and only if]] it is the simple majority method.

{{Battles involving Assyria}}
[[File:Adad-Nirari stela.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Adad Nirari II brought Assyria out of servitude and waged war upon her enemies, succeeded in driving foreigners out of Assyria's heartland.&lt;ref name="Healy6"/&gt;]]

The [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] arose in the 10th century BC. [[Ashurnasirpal II]] is credited for utilizing sound strategy in his wars of conquest. While aiming to secure defensible frontiers, he would launch raids further inland against his opponents as a means of securing economic benefit,&lt;ref&gt;Healy, ''The Ancient Assyrians'', p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; as he did when campaigning in the Levant. The result meant that the economic prosperity of the region would fuel the Assyrian war machine.&lt;ref name=HealyAA10&gt;Healy, ''The Ancient Assyrians'', p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Ashurnasirpal II was succeeded by [[Shalmaneser III]]. Although he campaigned for 31 years of his 35-year reign,&lt;ref name=HealyAA10/&gt; he failed to achieve or equal the conquests of his predecessor,&lt;ref name="Healy13"&gt;Healy, ''The Ancient Assyrians'', p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; and his death led to another period of weakness in Assyrian rule.&lt;ref name="Healy13"/&gt;

Assyria would later recover under [[Tiglath Pileser III]], whose reforms once again made Assyria the most powerful force in the Near East,&lt;ref name="Healy17"&gt;Healy, ''The Ancient Assyrians'', p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; and transformed it into a fully fledged empire – the first of its kind. Later, under [[Shalmaneser V]], [[Sargon II]] and [[Sennacherib]], further Assyrian offensives occurred, although these were designed not only for conquest, but also to destroy the enemies ability to undermine Assyrian power. As such, costly battles raged taking tolls on Assyrian manpower. [[Esarhaddon]] succeeded in taking lower Egypt and his successor, [[Ashurbanipal]], took the southern upper half of Egypt.

However, by the end of the Ashurbanipal's reign it appears that the Assyrian Empire was falling into another period of weakness,&lt;ref name="Healy54"&gt;Healy, ''The Ancient Assyrians'', p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; one from which it would not escape. It appears that years of costly battles followed by constant (and almost unstoppable) rebellions meant that it was a matter of time before Assyria ran out of troops. The loss of the outer regions meant that foreign troops were gone too. By 605 BC, independent political Assyrian records vanish from history and the Assyrians lost their independence forever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grant|first=R.G.|title=Battle a Visual Journey Through 5000 Years of Combat|location=London|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|year=2005|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Assyrian empire has been described as the "first [[List of pre-modern great powers|military power]] in history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Burenhult | first = Göran | title = Bra böckers encyklopedi om människans historia. 5, Civilisationens vaggor: tidiga högkulturer i esopotamien, Egypten och Asien | language = Swedish | isbn = 91-7133-171-9 | oclc = 186397556 | pages = 37 | quote = Assyrien har med rätta kallats världens första militärmakt.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mesopotamia]] was the site of some of the earliest recorded battles in history.&lt;ref name=Grant5000p12&gt;{{cite book|last=Grant|first=R.G.|title=Battle a Visual Journey Through 5000 Years of Combat|location=London|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|year=2005|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grant13"&gt;{{cite book|last=Grant|first=R.G.|title=Battle a Visual Journey Through 5000 Years of Combat|location=London|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|year=2005|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the first recorded battle was between the forces of [[Lagash]] and [[Umma]] c. 2450 BC. Like many Mesopotamian records, it contains elements of fiction. The  ruler of Lagash, [[Eanatum]], was inspired by the god [[Ningirsu]] to attack the rival kingdom of Umma; the two were involved in minor skirmishes and raids along their respective borders.&lt;ref name="Grant13"/&gt; Eanatum, although having triumphed, was struck in the eye by an arrow. After the battle, he proudly documented the behavior of the vultures.

===Akkadian and Old Assyrian===

The earliest [[Old Assyrian Empire|Old Assyrian]] king [[Tudiya]] was a contemporary of [[Ibrium]] of [[Ebla]].&lt;ref name="Healy6"&gt;Healy, ''The Ancient Assyrians'', p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bertman|first=Stephen|title=Handbook to Life in Ancient Mesopotamia|location=New York|publisher=Oxford UP|year=2005|pages= 10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It evolved from the [[Akkadian Empire]] of the late 3rd millennium BC.&lt;ref name=BertmanHandbook56&gt;{{cite book|last=Bertman|first=Stephen|title=Handbook to Life in Ancient Mesopotamia|location=[[New York City|New York]]|publisher=Oxford UP|year=2005|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assyria was a strong nation under the rule of [[Ilushuma]] (1945–1906 BC), who founded colonies in [[Asia Minor]] and raided [[Isin]] and other [[Sumero-Akkadian]] states in southern Mesopotamia. 

According to legend, [[Sargon of Akkad|Sargon]], the first king of the Akkadian Kingdom, was discovered by a gardener in Mesopotamia in a basket.&lt;ref name="Grant13"/&gt; In time, he would found the city of Agade and raise an army of 5,400 men,&lt;ref name="Grant13"/&gt; and then conquer much of modern-day Iraq. His inscriptions boast of 34 victories and "5,400 men eating bread before Sargon", exemplifying both the vast manpower and the obedience of his troops (and possibly a standing army as well). Though small by the standards of later kings, Sargon's army was larger and more sophisticated than others of the time, utilizing a combination of spears and missile weapons. Bronze swords and four wheeled chariots&lt;ref name="Grant13"/&gt; brushed aside any resistance as he carved out his empire, which may well have included (at least briefly) parts of the Mediterranean, [[Anatolia]] and western [[Iran]].&lt;ref name=Grant5000p12/&gt; Siege warfare was not a problem; most of the cities that were walled at the time of Sargon were made of mud and his inscriptions further boast of the destruction he brought on their walls.&lt;ref name="Grant13"/&gt;

===Middle Assyrian===
Under [[Shamshi-Adad I]] (1813–1791 BC) and his successor [[Ishme-Dagan]] (1790–1754 BC), Assyria was the seat of a regional empire controlling northern Mesopotamia and regions in Asia Minor and northern Syria. From 1365 to 1076 BC, Assyria became a major empire and world power, rivalling [[Egypt]]. Kings such as [[Ashur-uballit I]] (1365–1330 BC), [[Enlil-nirari]] (1329–1308 BC), [[Arik-den-ili]] (c. 1307–1296 BC), [[Adad-nirari I]] (1295–1275 BC), [[Shalmaneser I]] (1274–1245 BC), [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]] (1244–1208 BC), [[Ashur-resh-ishi I]] (1133–1116 BC) and [[Tiglath-Pileser I]] (1115–1077 BC) forged an empire which at its peak stretched from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the [[Caspian Sea]], and from the foothills of the [[Caucasus]] to [[Arabia]].&lt;ref name="Hugh Chrisholm 1911, p. 968"&gt;The encyclopædia britannica:a dictionary of arts, sciences, literature and general information, Volume 26, Edited by Hugh Chrisholm, 1911, p. 968&lt;/ref&gt; The 11th and 10th centuries BC were a [[Greek Dark Ages|dark age]] for the entire [[Near East]], [[North Africa]], [[Caucasus]], [[Mediterranean]] and [[Balkan]] regions, with great upheavals and mass movements of people. Despite the apparent weakness of Assyria, at heart it remained a solid, well defended nation whose warriors were the best in the world. Assyria, with its stable monarchy and secure borders, was in a stronger position during this time than potential rivals such as Egypt, [[Babylonia]], [[Elam]], [[Phrygia]], [[Urartu]], [[Persia]] and [[Median Empire|Media]]&lt;ref&gt;According to George Roux, ''Ancient Iraq'', p. 282–283.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with the campaigns of [[Adad-nirari II]] (911–892 BC).

Information on the Assyrian army during this time is difficult to make out. The Assyrians were able to establish their independence on two occasions, during the [[Assyria|Old Assyrian Kingdom]] and the [[Assyria|Middle Assyrian Kingdom]], with the latter reaching as far as [[Babylon]] in their pursuit of conquest. However, military tactics mainly involved using troops raised from farmers who had finished planting their fields and so could campaign for the king until harvest time called for their attention again. The result was that military campaigning was limited to a few months of the year. As a result, armies could not conquer vast amounts of land without having to rest (and hence allow their enemy to recover) and even if they did they would not be able to garrison conquered lands with troops for long.

==Organization of the military==
The Assyrian army's [[hierarchy]] was typical of the Mesopotamian armies at the time. The King whose rule was sanctioned by the gods, would be the commander of the entire army of the Empire. He would appoint senior officers on certain occasions to campaign in his place if his presence on the battlefield could or had to be spared.&lt;ref name="Healy19"/&gt;

===Pre-reform===

[[File:Ashurnasirpal2 stele.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Assyria's greatest pre-reform military commander, Ashurnasirpal II]]
Before the reforms of Tiglath-Pileser III, the Assyrian army was also very much similar to the other Mesopotamian armies of the time. Soldiers were mostly raised farmers, who had to return to their fields to collect the harvest. Professional soldiers were limited to a few bodyguards that protected the King and or other nobles and officials but these would not have been deployed or wasted in battle unless the situation became urgent, as it later did.

Assyrian armies could be very large; Shalmaneser III once boasted a force of 120,000 men in his campaigns against Syria.&lt;ref name="Healy23"&gt;Healy, ''The Ancient Assyrians'', p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Such a force required men to be extracted from conquered peoples. A large army also needed more food and supplies and for this the Assyrians organized what they needed for a campaign before they set out.

===Preparations for a new campaign===

Preparations for a new campaign required first and foremost the assembly of troops at a designated base. In Assyria, the designated locations included Nineveh, Kalhu or Khorsabad. On some occasions the designated meeting points would change depending upon the campaign. Governors were instructed to accumulate supplies of grain, oil and war material. Other requirements of the Governors included calling up the needed manpower. Vassal states were in particular required to present troops as part of their tribute to the Assyrian king and in good time: failure to do so would have almost certainly been seen as an act of rebellion.&lt;ref name="Healy23"/&gt;

The arrival of the King and his bodyguard ended the preliminary stage and the army would move on to the target of their campaign. The army would march in good order; in the vanguard came the standard of the Gods, signifying the servitude of the Assyrian Kings to their primary God Assur. Following this was the King, the humble servant of Assur surrounded by his bodyguard with the support of the main chariot divisions and cavalry, the elite of the army. In the rear was the infantry; the Assyrian troops followed by the conquered peoples. Following this would be the siege train, supply wagons and then the camp followers. Such a formation would have been very vulnerable to a rear attack. Some columns of troops could travel 30 miles a day and such speed would have been used to surprise and frighten an opponent into submission.&lt;ref name="Healy23"/&gt;

===Reforms of Tiglath-Pileser III===

{{main|Tiglath-Pileser III}}
[[File:Tiglath-Pileser II - 1889 drawing.jpg|left|thumb|200px|An image of Tiglath Pileser III's troops (not II). In the background can be seen a siege engine.]]
Before long, the weaknesses of the Assyrian army soon began to show itself. Battle after battle killed off important soldiers, while the seasons ensured that soldiers returned after a short time to their fields without achieving decisive conquests. By the mid-8th century BC, the Assyrian levy-army could not cope with the demands of an empire that often stretched from the Mediterranean Sea to the Persian Gulf.&lt;ref name="Healy18"&gt;Healy, ''The Ancient Assyrians'', p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

All was to change when Tiglath Pileser III came to the throne in 745 BC. After increasing the efficiency of the Assyrian administration,&lt;ref name="Healy17"/&gt; he went on to change the Assyrian army as well.&lt;ref name="Healy18"/&gt; The most important aspect of his reform was the introduction of a standing army. This included a larger number of foreign soldiers but mixed in with other Assyrian soldiers.&lt;ref name="Healy19"&gt;Healy, ''The Ancient Assyrians'', p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Healy18"/&gt; These men could be supplied by vassal states as tribute or when demanded by the Assyrian King. They were given Assyrian equipment and uniform which made them indistinguishable from one another, possibly to increase their integration.&lt;ref name="Healy18"/&gt; While the infantry in the standing army contained a large number of foreigners (including Aramaeans and even Greeks), the Assyrian cavalry and charioteers continued to be dominated by Assyrians.&lt;ref name="Healy19"/&gt; There were exceptions however, and as casualties mounted additional troops would not be unwelcome; Sargon II reports that he managed to incorporate 60 Israelite chariot teams into his army.&lt;ref name="Healy18"/&gt;

===Transportation and communication===
{{see|State communications in the Neo-Assyrian Empire}}

With the rise of the Assyrian Empire, new demands were placed on transport and communication. Prior to the Neo-Assyrian Empire, roads in Mesopotamia were little more than well-trodden pathways used by the locals. However, this was inadequate for an empire whose armies were constantly on the move, repressing one revolt after another. The Assyrians were the first to institute, control and maintain a system of roads throughout their empire. [[State communications in the Neo-Assyrian Empire|A state communnication system]] with regular way stations for messengers to rest and/or exchange mounts were established. Later, these would form the basis for the Persians to expand this system to their own [[Persian Empire|empire]].&lt;ref name="Bertman254"&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook to Life in Ancient Mesopotamia|last=Bertman|first=Stephen|publisher=Oxford UP|year=2005|location=New York|pages=254}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rugged mountains were cut through thus greatly decreasing travel time. Engineers built fine stone pavements leading up to the grand cities of [[Assur]] and [[Nineveh]], so as to impress foreigners with the wealth of Assyria. By the 2nd millennium BC, wooden bridges were built across the [[Euphrates]]. By the 1st millennium BC, Nineveh and Assur had stone bridges,&lt;ref name="Bertman254"/&gt; testament to the wealth of the kingdom of Ashur. The construction of roads and increased transport meant that goods would flow through the empire with greater ease, thus feeding the Assyrian war effort further. Of course, roads that sped up Assyrian troops would not discriminate and would speed up enemy troops as well.

===Use of camels===
The Assyrians were the first to use camels as beasts of burden for their military campaigns. Camels were of greater use than donkeys because they can carry five times the load and yet require less watering. Camels were not domesticated until shortly before 1000 BC, on the eve of the Neo-Assyrian Empire.&lt;ref name="Bertman255"&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook to Life in Ancient Mesopotamia|last=Bertman|first=Stephen|publisher=Oxford UP|year=2005|location=New York|pages=255}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first camel to be domesticated was the [[dromedary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/870312289|title=Worlds together, worlds apart.|last=L.,|first=Tignor, Robert|others=Adelman, Jeremy,, Aron, Stephen,, Brown, Peter, 1935-, Elman, Benjamin A., 1946-, Liu, Xinru,, Pittman, Holly,|isbn=9780393922080|edition=Fourth edition, [Two volume edition]|location=New York|oclc=870312289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, the Sumerians are credited for inventing the wheel sometime before 3000 BC, although there is increasing evidence to support an Indo-European origin in the Black Sea region of Ukraine (Wolchover, Scientific American, 2012). In any case, the Assyrians were the first to manufacture tires of metal, made from copper, bronze and later iron.&lt;ref name="Bertman255"/&gt; Metal-covered wheels have the advantage of being more durable.

===Chariots===

The core of the Assyrian army lay in its chariots. Originally these chariots were used as two-horse vehicles. The Ancient Egyptians and Sumerians used war chariots in this fashion as firing mobile platforms or as mobile command platforms; the elevated view would give the general some ability to see how the troops fared in battle. The Assyrians also used chariots in reconnaissance, carrying messages to and from the front lines, and for battle. However, the rise of cavalry in the 1st millennium BC meant that by the 7th century BC, the chariot was demoted to combat duties only; lighter chariots consisting of two to three horses were later upgraded under the reign of Ashurnasirpal II to heavy four horse chariots. Such chariots could contain up to four men. Heavier chariots also found new roles, smashing into enemy formations and dispersing the infantry in the process.&lt;ref name="Healy20"&gt;Healy, ''The Ancient Assyrians'', p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The Assyrian cavalry and infantry would then be able to exploit the gap and rout the enemy, thereby taking the [[battle]]field.

===Cavalry===
[[File:Assyrian cavalry charge the enemy, dating back to the reign of Ashurnasirpal II, 865-860 BCE. In this period, cavalry was relatively new. Detail of a gypsum wall relief from Nimrud, Iraq, currently housed in the British Museum.jpg|thumb|Assyrian cavalry charge the enemy, dating back to the reign of Ashurnasirpal II, 865–860 BC. In this period, cavalry was relatively new. Detail of a gypsum wall relief from Nimrud, Iraq, currently housed in the British Museum]]
[[Cavalry]] were rarely used by the Assyrians or many other Mesopotamians until the 9th century BC, when their use is mentioned during the reign of [[Tukulti-Ninurta II]].&lt;ref name="Healy20"/&gt; Before then, many nomads or steppe warriors relied on cavalry, who raided Assyrian lands. The Assyrians had to counter this mobile form of warfare and so beat their opponents, notably the Iranians, at their own game.&lt;ref name="Healy21"&gt;Healy, ''The Ancient Assyrians'', p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the greatest outside influence is that of the Iranian [[Medes]]. It is ironic that the raiding by that people assisted Assyrian attempts in building a cavalry army with which to destroy the Kingdom of Elam. However, Assyrian attempts were not without difficulties; [[horse archers]] were used but could not use their bows and the [[reins]] of their horses at the same time. As a result, cavalry under Ashurnasirpal are depicted in pairs, with one rider holding both reins and the other shooting with a bow. The Assyrians experienced fewer problems with cavalry when they were deployed as lancers; under [[Tiglath Pileser III]], the Assyrian Cavalry continued to be paired but this time each warrior held his own lance and controlled his own horse.&lt;ref name="Healy20"/&gt; By the 7th century BC, mounted Assyrian warriors were well armed with a bow and a lance,&lt;ref name="Healy20"/&gt; and armored with lamellar armour, while their mounts were equipped with fabric armour, providing limited yet useful protection in close combat and against missiles. Cavalry were to form the core of the later Assyrian armies.

Large units of cavalry were required to be deployed by the Assyrians; some units consisted of hundreds or even a thousand horsemen. There is little doubt that without a continuous supply of horses, the Assyrian war machine would have collapsed. As the empire suffered horrendous casualties under Ashurbanipal's campaigns of conquest, the rebellions following his death may have contributed significantly to the downfall of the empire as fewer vassals were available to pay tribute horses and other war material needed. Horses were a very important war resource and the Assyrian king himself took a personal interest in overseeing an adequate horse supply.&lt;br/&gt;Three main sources of horses were:
* Raids designed to steal horses from opponents, albeit from Scythians or other steppe peoples
* Tribute paid by vassal states
* High-ranking state officers overseeing horse production and report to the King.&lt;ref name="Healy21"/&gt;

Horses were be drawn from outlying provinces and brought in to be trained with new recruits for war.&lt;ref name="Healy21"/&gt;

[[File:Assyrian archers.jpg|thumb|right|Assyrian archers taking aim, under the protection of a shield bearer.]]
While cavalry provided the most expensive and effective arm of the Assyrian Empire, infantry were cheaper and more numerous. In the right circumstances, they were also more effective, for example in siege warfare where the mobility provided by horsemen would be of no advantage.
Assyrian infantry were composed of both native Assyrians and foreigners employed as [[auxiliaries]], spearmen, slingers, shield bearers or archers. The latter type was the most dominant in Assyrian armies.&lt;ref name="Healy21"/&gt; From the time of Ashurnasirpal, archers would be accompanied by a shield bearer while slingers would aim to distract the enemy into lowering their shield to protect against the stones, thereby allowing the archers to shoot above their shield walls and slay their enemies. Even in siege warfare, arrows were used to drive back defenders from the wall while engineers advanced against the fortifications. Many different types of bows are recorded by the Assyrians, including Akkadian, Cimmerian and their own "Assyrian" type. However, it is most likely that these were simply different variants of the powerful composite bow. Depending upon the bow, an archer would have a range of anything between 250 to 650 meters. Vast numbers of arrows could be expended in battle so in preparation for war many arrows would be made. Facilities also existed that would travel with the army's supply train that could manufacture more arrows.&lt;ref name="Healy22"&gt;Healy, ''The Ancient Assyrians'', p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; 

Lancers were introduced to the infantry under Tiglath-pileser III.&lt;ref name="Healy22"/&gt; Depictions of infantry with special bronze scale metal protection are rare and reconstructions show the smallest vests to weigh as much as 20 pounds / 9&amp;nbsp;kg with armoured suits up to the ankles tripling that weight of metal and leather.&lt;ref&gt;R. Hachmann, Frühe Phöniker im Libanon. [German] p. 94-100&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategy and tactics==

===Tactics===

[[File:Assyrian spearman · HHWI469.svg|thumb|left|300px|From ''[[The Historians' History of the World]]'' : ''"The spear of the Assyrian footman was short, scarcely exceeding the height of a man; that of the horseman appears to have been considerably longer… The shaft was probably of some strong wood, and did not consist of a reed, like that of the modern Arab lance."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

{{cquote|At the command of the god Ashur, the great Lord, I rushed upon the enemy like the approach of a hurricane...I put them to rout and turned them back. I transfixed the troops of the enemy with javelins and arrows. Humban-undasha, the commander in chief of the king of Elam, together with his nobles...I cut their throats like sheep...My prancing steeds, trained to harness, plunged into their welling blood as into a river; the wheels of my battle chariot were bespattered with blood and filth. I filled the plain with corpses of their warriors like herbage|author=Sennacherib&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Healy|first=Mark|title=The Ancient Assyrians|location=New York|publisher= Osprey|year=1991|pages=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Assyrian frontal offensives were designed to shock the enemy and surprise them. However, they were also a strategy employed when time was not on their side:

{{cquote|The harassed troops of Ashur, who had come a long way, very weary slow to respond, who had crossed and re-crossed sheer mountains innumerable, of great trouble for ascent and descent, their morale turned mutinous. I could give no ease to their weariness, no water to quench their thirst; I could set up no camp, nor fix defences|author=Sargon II&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Healy|first=Mark|title=The Ancient Assyrians|location=New York|publisher= Osprey|year=1991|pages=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Despite the above, Sargon II's instinct saved the day; leading his exhausted troops, he launched a surprise attack against his Urartian opponents who broke at the speed and surprise of the attack. So vicious was the battle that the Urartian King abandoned his state officials, governors, 230 members of the royal family, many cavalry and infantry, and even the capital itself.

===Overall war strategy===

[[File:AssyrianWarship.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Assyrian warships. The Assyrians would have used these to transport horses, chariots and supplies across rivers. Although they reached the Mediterranean on numerous occasions,&lt;ref name=HealyAAVarious&gt;{{cite book|last=Healy|first=Mark|title=The Ancient Assyrians|location=New York|publisher= Osprey|year=1991|pages= Various pages}}&lt;/ref&gt; problems (in the shape of rebellions) in the [[Fertile Crescent]] would have made such sea ventures into the Mediterranean unlikely.]]
The nature of Mesopotamia; plain and fertile with few natural defenses meant that defensive operations were out of the question; only a decisive attack could defend such vulnerable yet valuable locations. The cities of Assur and Nineveh were both "sandwiched" between rivers, Nineveh being more so enclosed and protected by the Tigris while Assur, while being close to the Tigris, was a fair distance away from the Euphrates. The result was that both cities had a measure of natural protection. However, rivers would not stop a determined army so attacking and destroying the enemies' ability to wage war was the best method of ensuring survival. To this end the Assyrians sought a decisive encounter that would destroy the enemies' army.

'''Colonization''': The Assyrians, in conjunction with their deportation (see below) would also send some of their own into foreign lands and settle them as colonists. The primary aim was to establish a loyal power base; taxes, food and troops could be raised here as reliably as at their homeland, or at least it must have been hoped. Furthermore, their presence would bring innumerable benefits; resistance to other conquerors, a counter to any rebellions by the natives and assist the provincial Assyrian governors in ensuring that the vassal state was loyal to Assyria.

'''Total Destruction''': One must be careful before assuming that the Assyrians utilized [[total war]]. However, it is known that the Assyrians, as part of their overall strategy of weakening their opponents and of exacting revenge, would violently destroy what they could not take back or could not consolidate.:

{{cquote|For a distance of a month and twenty-five days' journey I devastated the provinces of Elam. Salt and sihlu I scattered over them... The dust of Susa, Madaktu, Haltemash and the rest of the cities I gathered together and took to Assyria... The noise of people, the tread of cattle and sheep, the glad shouts of rejoicing, I banished from its fields. Wild asses, gazelles and all kinds of beasts of the plain I caused to lie down among them, as if at home.|author=Ashurbanipal&lt;ref name="Healy54"/&gt;}}

==Psychological warfare==

The Assyrians fully appreciated the use of terrorizing their enemies. To conserve manpower and rapidly move on to solve Assyria's multiple problems, the Assyrians preferred to accept the surrender of their opponents or else destroy their ability to resist a surrender. This in part explains their offensive strategy and tactics.

===Deportations===

[[File:Deportation of Jews by Assyrians.svg|thumb|right|150px|The Jews were one of the many peoples deported by the Assyrians.]]
It is not known if the Assyrians were the first to deport people, although since none before had ruled the Fertile Crescent as they did it is likely that they were the first to practice it on a large scale. The Assyrians began to utilize mass-deportation as a punishment for rebellions since the 13th century BC.&lt;ref name="Bertman268"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bertman|first=Stephen|title=Handbook to Life in Ancient Mesopotamia|location=New York|publisher=Oxford UP|year=2005|pages= 268}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purposes of deportation included, but were not limited to:{{Citation needed|date= August 2012}}

1) '''Psychological warfare:''' the possibility of deportation would have terrorized the people;&lt;br&gt;
2) '''Integration:''' a multi-ethnic population base in each region would have curbed nationalist sentiment, making the running of the Empire smoother;&lt;br&gt;
3) '''Preservation of human resources:''' rather than being butchered, the people could serve as slave labor or as conscripts in the army.

By the 9th century BC, the Assyrians made it a habit of regularly deporting thousands of restless subjects to other lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bertman|first=Stephen|title=Handbook to Life in Ancient Mesopotamia|location=New York|publisher=Oxford UP|year=2005|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Re-settling these people in the Assyrian homeland would have undermined the powerbase of the Assyrian Empire if they rebelled again. As a result, Assyrian deportation involved removing one enemy population and settling them into another. Below is a list of deportations carried out by Assyrian Kings:&lt;ref name=HealyAAVarious&gt;{{cite book|last=Healy|first=Mark|title=The Ancient Assyrians|location=New York|publisher= Osprey|year=1991|pages= Various pages}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 744 BC: Tiglath Pileser III deports 65,000 people from Iran to the Assyrian-Babylonian border at the Diyala river
* 742 BC: Tiglath Pileser III deports 30,000 people from Hamath, Syria and into the Zagros mountains in the east.
* 721 BC: Sargon II (claimed) deports 27,290 people from Samaria, Israel and disperses them throughout the Empire. However, it is likely that his ousted predecessor, Shalmaneser V ordered the deportation
* 707 BC: Sargon II deports 108,000 Chaldeans and Babylonians from the Babylonian region
* 703 BC: Sennacherib deports 208,000 people from Babylon

Tiglath Pileser III re-introduced deportation on a grand scale, deporting tens, even hundreds of thousands of people. Deportations were also coupled with colonization; see above for more details.

===Dealing with rebels===
[[File:Flaying of rebels.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Assyria]]ns flaying their prisoners alive]]
Whenever a rebellion broke out in the Assyrian empire, the Assyrian kings inevitably brutally crushed it (as an alternative to deportation) and enforced great punishments on the rebellious vassals. [[Ashurnasirpal II]] assured that the rebellions whom he encountered would be crushed with the same cruelty so that his opponents would never do it again. In one of his expeditions, Ashurnasirpal II described how he faced the rebels, in which they were being [[flaying|flayed]], impaled, decapitated, or burned alive:

{{cquote|I felled 3,000 of their fighting men with the sword. I carried off prisoners, possessions, oxen, [and] cattle from them. I burnt many captives from them. I captured many troops alive: from some I cut off their arms [and] hands; from others I cut off their noses, ears, [and] extremities. I gouged out the eyes of many troops. I made one pile of the living (and) one of heads. I hung their heads on trees around the city, I burnt their adolescent boys [and] girls. I razed, destroyed, burnt, [and] consumed the city.|author=Ashurnasirpal II&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Albert Kirk Grayson|title=Assyrian Rulers of the Early First Millennium BC: I (1114-859 BC) (Royal Inscriptions of Mesopotamia. Assyrian Periods. Volume 2)|location=|publisher= University of Toronto Press|year=1991|pages=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The brutal treatment of Ashurnasirpal II succeeded in pacifying the rebels. While campaigning in Syria, he was able to take a large number of soldiers from Mesopotamia, without fear of a rebellion cutting off their supply lines. They were so successful in their brutality in the northern cities of Syria in that many of the smaller settlements were immediately handed over to their troops, then they marched south in parallel of the Mediterranean.

The Assyrians considered their kings as ruling with the gods’ (or the god [[Ashur (god)|Ashur]]) sanction. To rebel against this most humble servant of Ashur, it means defying Ashur himself, something that could only bring divine destruction; therefore, the glorification of such brutality.

Other acts of brutality are: rape, mutilation of men to death, putting heads, arms, hands and lips even down the walls of the conquered city, skulls and noses on the top at stakes. Alternatively corpses can also be stacked or even being cut and fed to the dogs. On some occasions, blinding people in that as they roam around talking about the Assyrian terrors to demoralize the local population.

==Siege warfare==
[[File:Susa-destruction.jpg|thumb|200px|Susa, sacked by the Assyrians. [[Ashurbanipal]]'s brutal campaign against Susa in 647 BC is triumphantly recorded in this relief. Here, flames rise from the city as [[Assyria]]n soldiers topple it with pickaxes and crowbars and carry off the spoils.]]
In 647 BC, the Assyrian king [[Assurbanipal]] leveled the city during a war in which the people of [[Susa]] apparently participated on the other side. A tablet unearthed in 1854 by [[Austen Henry Layard]] in [[Nineveh]] reveals Ashurbanipal as an "avenger", seeking retribution for the humiliations the Elamites had inflicted on the Mesopotamians over the centuries. Ashurbanipal dictates Assyrian retribution after his successful siege of Susa:

{{cquote|Susa, the great holy city, abode of their gods, seat of their mysteries, I conquered. I entered its palaces, I opened their treasuries where silver and gold, goods and wealth were amassed... I destroyed the ziggurat of Susa. I smashed its shining copper horns. I reduced the temples of Elam to naught; their gods and goddesses I scattered to the winds. The tombs of their ancient and recent kings I devastated, I exposed to the sun, and I carried away their bones toward the land of Ashur. I devastated the provinces of Elam and on their lands I sowed salt.|author=Ashurbanipal&lt;ref name="Susa"/&gt;}}

The plains and fertile lands of Mesopotamia were not only ideal for warfare but actually attracted war. Raiders from all nations coveted the lands of the Assyrians: [[Scythians]] to the north, [[Demographics of Syria|Syrians]], [[Arameans]] and [[Cimmerians]] to the West, [[Elamites]] to the East and [[Babylonians]] to the south. In fact, the latter never tired of rebelling against Assyrian rule.&lt;ref name="Healy13"/&gt; As a result, in order to prevent chariots and cavalry from completely overwhelming these settlements, walls were constructed though often from mud or clay since stone was neither cheap, nor readily available. In order to destroy the opponents, these cities had to be taken as well and so the Assyrians soon mastered siege warfare; Esarhaddon claims to have taken Memphis, the capital of Egypt in less than a day, demonstrating the ferocity and skill of Assyrian siege tactics at this point in time:

{{cquote|I fought daily, without interruption against Taharqa, King of Egypt and Ethiopia, the one accursed by all the great gods. Five times I hit him with the point of my arrows inflicting wounds from which he should not recover, and then I laid siege to Memphis his royal residence, and conquered it in half a day by means of mines, breaches and assault ladders|author=Esarhaddon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Healy|first=Mark|title=The Ancient Assyrians|location=New York|publisher= Osprey|year=1991|pages=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Sieges were costly in terms of manpower and more so if an assault was launched to take the city by force—the siege of Lachish cost the Assyrians at least 1,500 men found at a mass grave near Lachish.&lt;ref name="Healy23"/&gt; Before the advent of standing armies, a city's best hope would be that the harvest would force the enemy to return to their fields and therefore abandon the city. However, with the reforms of Tiglath Pileser III Assyria's first standing army was forged and could therefore blockade a city until it surrendered instead. Nonetheless it is known that Assyrians always preferred to take a city by assault than to settle down for a blockade: the former method would be followed by extermination or deportation of the inhabitants and would therefore frighten the opponents of Assyria into surrendering as well.&lt;ref name="Grant17"&gt;{{cite book|last=Grant|first=R.G.|title=Battle a Visual Journey Through 5000 Years of Combat|location=London|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|year=2005|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Siege weapons===

The most common siege weapon and by far the cheapest was the ladder. However, ladders are easy to topple over and so the Assyrians would shower their opponents with arrows to provide cover fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bertman|first=Stephen|title=Handbook to Life in Ancient Mesopotamia|location=New York|publisher=Oxford UP|year=2005|pages=267}}&lt;/ref&gt; These archers in turn would be supported by shield bearers.&lt;ref name="Healy22"&gt;Healy, ''The Ancient Assyrians'', p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; Other ways of undermining the enemies' defences included mining. A 9th-century Assyrian [[relief]] depicts soldiers using ladders to scale walls, while others use their spears to scrape  the mud and clay from the walls. A soldier is also depicted beneath a wall, suggesting that mining was used to undermine the foundations and bring the walls down on their opponents.

The battering ram appears to be one of the best Assyrian contributions to siege warfare. Although looking nothing like the tougher weapons used by the Greeks and Romans many centuries later, they nonetheless served their purpose. They consisted of a tank-like wooden frame on four wheels. There was a small tower on top for archers to provide covering fire as the engine moved forward. When it had reached its destination, its primary weapon, a large spear, was used to batter away and chip pieces of the enemy wall. While this would have been almost useless against stone walls, one must keep in mind that mud and not stone was used to build walls. Even when dried, these mud walls could be attacked with such engines. Walls were strengthened with time and the Assyrians responded by building larger engines with bigger "spears". In time, they closely resembled a large and long log with a metal tip at the end. Even stone would not withstand pounding by a larger weapon. Larger engines accommodated greater numbers of archers. To protect against fire (which was used by both sides at the Siege of Lachish) the battering ram would be covered in wet animal skins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Healy|first=Mark|title=The Ancient Assyrians|location=New York|publisher= Osprey|year=1991|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; These could be watered at any time in battle in case they dried.

{{cquote|I captured 46 towns... by consolidating ramps to bring up battering rams, by infantry attacks, mines, breaches and siege engines|author=Sennacherib&lt;ref name="Grant17"/&gt;}}

Siege towers, even ones that could float were reported to have been in use whenever there was a wall facing a river.&lt;ref name="Healy23"/&gt;

He was an [[Iran]]ian [[politician]] and the head of a government that was removed in 1953 by a [[CIA]]-backed coup,&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Burke, Mark Elliott &amp; Kamin Mohammadi, ''Iran'' (Lonely Planet, 2004; {{ISBN|1740594258}}), p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Cold War and the 1950s'' (Social Studies School Service, 2007: {{ISBN|1560042931}}), p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Loretta Capeheart and Dragan Milovanovic, ''Social Justice: Theories, Issues, and Movements'' (Rutgers University Press, 2007; {{ISBN|0813540380}}), p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; holding office as the [[Prime Minister of Iran|Prime Minister]] of [[Iran]] from 1951 until 1953, when his government was overthrown in a [[1953 Iranian coup d'état|coup d'état]] orchestrated by the United States' [[Central Intelligence Agency]] and the United Kingdom's [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/world/mideast/041600iran-cia-chapter3.html | title =SECRETS OF HISTORY The C.I.A. in Iran THE COUP First Few Days Look Disastrous | author =[[James Risen]]| publisher =nytimes.com | year =2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="All the Shah's Men"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol48no2/article10.html | title =All the Shah's Men: An American Coup and the Roots of Middle East Terror | author = Stephen Kinzer, John Wiley | author2 =David S.

An author, administrator, lawyer and prominent parliamentarian, his administration introduced a range of social and political measures such as social security, land reforms and higher taxes including the introduction of taxation of the rent on land. His government's most significant policy, however, was the [[nationalization]] of the Iranian oil industry, which had been built by the British on Persian lands since 1913 through the [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]] (APOC/{{abbr|AIOC|Anglo-Iranian Oil Company}}) (later British Petroleum and [[BP]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Yergin]], ''The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money and Power'' ({{ISBN|9781439110126}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Iranians regard Mosaddegh as the leading champion of [[secular]] democracy and resistance to foreign domination in Iran's modern history. Mosaddegh was removed from power in a [[1953 Iranian coup d'état|coup]] on 19 August 1953, organized and carried out by the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] at the request of MI6, which chose Iranian General [[Fazlollah Zahedi]] to succeed Mosaddegh.&lt;ref name="jrisen"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/world/mideast/041600iran-cia-index.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Secrets of History: The C.I.A. in Iran|author=[[James Risen]]|date=16 April 2000|accessdate=3 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Mosaddegh was born to a prominent Persian family of high officials in [[Tehran]] on 16 June 1882; his father, Mirza Hideyatu'llah Ashtiani, was a finance minister under the [[Qajar dynasty]], and his mother, Princess Malek Taj Najm-es-Saltaneh, was the granddaughter of the reformist Qajar prince [[Abbas Mirza]], and a great-granddaughter of [[Fath-Ali Shah Qajar]].&lt;ref&gt;Mohammad Mossadegh: Political biography By Farhad Dība, p4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Cold War, 1945-1991: Leaders and other important figures in the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, China, and the Third World by Benjamin Frankel&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Afkhami|first=Gholam Reza|authorlink=Gholam Reza Afkhami|title=The life and times of the Shah|year=2009|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-25328-5|page=110|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pTVSPmyvtkAC&amp;pg=PA110}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Mosaddegh's father died in 1892, his uncle was appointed the tax collector of the [[Khorasan province]] and was bestowed with the title of Mosaddegh-os-Saltaneh by [[Nasser al-Din Shah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/campaigns/iran/irankey.xml|title=Key figures|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=7 November 2007|location=London|date=4 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mosaddegh himself later bore the same title, by which he was still known to some long after titles were abolished.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Avery, ''Modern Iran'' (Praeger, 1965), p. 273: "Older people still speak of Dr. Musaddiq as Musaddiqu's-Saltanah."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1901, Mosaddegh married Zahra Khanum (1879–1965), a granddaughter of [[Nasser al-Din Shah]] through her mother. The couple had five children, two sons (Ahmad and Ghulam Hussein) and three daughters (Mansura, Zia Ashraf, and Khadija).

===Education===
[[File:Mossadegh childhood.jpg|thumb|left|A young Mosaddegh]]
In 1909, Mosaddegh pursued education abroad in Paris, France where he studied law at the [[Institut d'études politiques de Paris]] (Sciences Po). He studied there for 2 years, returning to Iran because of illness in 1911. After 5 months, Mosaddegh returned to Europe to study a Doctorate of Laws (''doctorate en Droit'') at the [[University of Neuchâtel]] in [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tlfl.blogfa.com/post-6.aspx|title=آموزش زبان|work=blogfa.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1913, Mosaddegh received his doctorate and in doing so became the first Iranian to receive a Ph.D. in Law from a European university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kinzer|first=Stephen|title=Inside Iran's Fury|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/people-places/iran-fury.html?c=y&amp;page=2|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003020305/http://www.smithsonianmag.com/people-places/iran-fury.html?c=y&amp;page=2|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2008-10-03|accessdate=9 August 2013|work=Smithsonian Magazine|date=October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mosaddegh taught at the [[Tehran School of Political Science]] at the start of [[World War I]] before beginning his political career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifvc.com/life_and_legacy_of_Mossadegh.htm|title=IFVC, The Political Life and Legacy of Mosaddegh, Bahman Maghsoudlou, Iranian Film Directors, New Productions|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110413023823/http://www.ifvc.com/life_and_legacy_of_Mossadegh.htm|archivedate=13 April 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early political career===
Mosaddegh started his political career with the [[Iranian Constitutional Revolution]] of 1905-07. At the age of 24, he was elected from [[Isfahan]] to the newly inaugurated Persian Parliament, the [[Majlis of Iran]]. However, he was unable to assume his seat, because he had not reached the legal age of 30.&lt;ref name="SK"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kinzer|first1=Stephen|title=All the Shah's men: an American coup and the roots of Middle East terror|date=2003|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Hoboken, N.J.|isbn=978-0471265177|pages=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period he also served as deputy leader of the [[Society of Humanity]], under [[Mostowfi ol-Mamalek]].&lt;ref name=iransoc&gt;{{cite web|last=Baktiar|first=Salar|title=The life of Mirza Hassan Khan, Mostofi Al Mamalek|url=http://www.iransociety.org/docs/journal_2005.pdf|date=24 November 2004|accessdate=31 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In protest at the [[Anglo-Persian Agreement|Anglo-Persian Treaty of 1919]], he relocated to Switzerland, from where he returned the following year after being invited by the new Iranian prime minister, [[Hassan Pirnia]] (Moshir-ed-Dowleh), to become his minister of justice. While en route to Tehran, he was asked by the people of [[Shiraz]] to become the governor of the [[Fars Province]]. He was later appointed [[finance minister]], in the government of [[Ahmad Qavam]] (Qavam os-Saltaneh) in 1921, and then [[foreign minister]] in the government of Moshir-ed-Dowleh in June 1923. He then became governor of the [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Azerbaijan Province]]. In 1923, he was re-elected to the Majlis.

In 1925, the supporters of [[Reza Khan]] in the Majlis proposed legislation to dissolve the [[Qajar dynasty]] and appoint Reza Khan the new Shah. Mossadegh voted against such a move, arguing that such an act was a subversion of the [[Persian Constitution of 1906|1906 Iranian constitution]]. He gave a speech in the Majlis, praising Reza Khan's achievements as prime minister while encouraging him to respect the constitution and stay as the prime minister. On 12 December 1925, the Majlis deposed the young Shah [[Ahmad Shah Qajar]], and declared Reza Shah the new monarch of the Imperial State of Persia, and the first Shah of the [[Pahlavi dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Mohammad Mossadegh: political biography By Farhad Dība, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; Mosaddegh then retired from politics, due to disagreements with the new regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Centers of Power in Iran|url=http://2001-2009.state.gov/documents/organization/70712.pdf|work=CIA|accessdate=5 August 2013|date=May 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kinzer, ''All the Shah's Men'' (2003) p.60&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, [[Reza Shah Pahlavi]] was forced by the British to abdicate in favor of his son [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]]. In 1944, Mosaddegh was once again elected to parliament. This time he took the lead of ''Jebhe Melli'' ([[National Front of Iran]], created in 1949), an organization he had founded with nineteen others such as [[Hossein Fatemi]], [[Ahmad Zirakzadeh]], [[Ali Shayegan]] and [[Karim Sanjabi]], aiming to establish democracy and end the foreign presence in Iranian politics, especially by nationalizing the [[Anglo-Iranian Oil Company]]'s (AIOC) operations in Iran. In 1947 Mossadegh once again announced retirement, after an electoral-reform bill he had proposed failed to pass through Majlis.&lt;ref&gt;, Kinzer, ''All the Shah's Men'' (2003) p.135&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appointment as Prime Minister===
[[File:Mossadeghmohammad.jpg|thumb|left|Mossadegh as [[Prime minister]] of Iran]]

On 28 April 1951, the Shah appointed Mossadegh as Prime Minister after the Majlis ([[Parliament of the Islamic Republic of Iran|Parliament of Iran]]) nominated Mosaddegh by a vote of 79–12. The Shah was aware of Mosaddegh's rising popularity and political power, after a period of assassinations by [[Fada'iyan-e Islam]] and political unrest by the [[National Front (Iran)|National Front]]. Demonstrations erupted in Tehran after Mosaddegh's appointment, with crowds further invigorated by the speeches of members from the National Front. There was a special focus on the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and the heavy involvement of foreign actors and influences in Iranian affairs. Despite the fact that Iran was never a colony or a protectorate, it was still heavily controlled by foreign powers beginning with concessions provided by the Qajar Shahs, and leading up to the oil agreement signed by [[Reza Shah]] in 1933.&lt;ref name="Westview Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cleveland|first1=William|title=A History of the Modern Middle East|date=2016|publisher=Westview Press|location=Boulder, CO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new administration introduced a wide range of social reforms: unemployment compensation was introduced, factory owners were ordered to pay benefits to sick and injured workers, and peasants were freed from forced labor in their landlords' estates. in 1952, Mossadegh passed the Land Reform Act which forced landlords to turn over 20% of their revenues to their tenants. These revenues could be placed in a fund to pay for development projects such as public baths, rural housing, and pest control.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/FI15Ak03.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 May, Mosaddegh nationalized the [[Anglo-Iranian Oil Company]], canceling its oil concession (expired in 1993) and expropriating its assets. Mossadegh saw the AIOC as an arm of the British government controlling much of the oil in Iran, pushing him to seize what the British had built for Iran.&lt;ref name="Westview Press"/&gt;. The next month, a committee  of five majlis deputies was sent to Khuzistan to enforce the nationalization.&lt;ref name = "Abrahamian 268"&gt;Abrahamian (1982) p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alan W. Ford, ''The Anglo-Iranian Oil Dispute of 1951-1952''. University of California Press, Berkeley 1954, p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt; Mosaddegh tried to justify his nationalization policy by claiming Iran was “the rightful owner...” of all the oil in Iran, and also pointing out Iran could use the money, in a 21 June 1951 speech:

{{quote|Our long years of negotiations with foreign countries... have yielded no results thus far. With the oil revenues, we could meet our entire budget and combat poverty, disease, and backwardness among our people. Another important consideration is that by the elimination of the power of the British company, we would also eliminate corruption and intrigue, by means of which the internal affairs of our country have been influenced. Once this tutelage has ceased, Iran will have achieved its economic and political independence. The Iranian state prefers to take over the production of petroleum itself. The company should do nothing else but return its property to the rightful owners. The nationalization law provides that 25% of the net profits on oil be set aside to meet all the legitimate claims of the company for compensation. It has been asserted abroad that Iran intends to expel the foreign oil experts from the country and then shut down oil installations. Not only is this allegation absurd; it is utter invention.&lt;ref&gt;M. Fateh, ''Panjah Sal-e Naft-e Iran'', p. 525.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The confrontation between Iran and Britain escalated as Mosaddegh's government refused to allow the British any involvement in their former enterprise, and Britain made sure Iran could sell no oil, which is considered stolen. In July, Mosaddegh broke off negotiations with AIOC after it threatened to "pull out its employees", and told owners of oil tanker ships that "receipts from the Iranian government would not be accepted on the world market." Two months later the AIOC evacuated its technicians and closed down the oil installations. Under nationalized management, many refineries lacked the trained technicians that were needed to continue production. The British government announced a ''de facto'' blockade, reinforced its naval force in the Persian Gulf and lodged complaints against Iran before the [[United Nations Security Council]].&lt;ref name = "Abrahamian 268"/&gt;
[[File:Mossadeghmohammadrezashah.jpg|thumb|Mosaddegh shaking hands with [[Mohammad-Reza Shah]] in their first meeting after Mossadegh's election as Prime Minister]]
[[File:Mossadegh soraya.jpg|thumb|Mosaddegh greets [[Soraya Esfandiary-Bakhtiary|Queen Soraya]]; note the [[kiss#Kiss of respect|kiss of respect]].]]

The British government also threatened legal action against purchasers of oil produced in the formerly British refineries seized by Iran and obtained an agreement with its sister international oil companies not to fill in where the AIOC was boycotting Iran. The entire Iranian oil industry came to a virtual standstill, oil production dropping from {{convert|241400000|oilbbl}} in 1950 to {{convert|10600000|oilbbl}} in 1952. This [[Abadan Crisis]] reduced Iran's oil income to almost nothing, putting a severe strain on the implementation of Mosaddegh's promised domestic reforms. At the same time, [[BP]] and [[Aramco]] doubled their production in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Iraq, to make up for lost production in Iran so that no hardship was felt in Britain.

Still enormously popular in late 1951, Mosaddegh called elections. His base of support was in urban areas and not in the provinces.&lt;ref name = "Abrahamian 268-70"&gt;Abrahamian (1982), p. 268–70.&lt;/ref&gt; This fact was reflected in the rejection of Mosaddegh's bill for electoral reform (which no longer disqualified illiterates from electoral participation) by the conservative bloc, on the grounds that it would "unjustly discriminate patriots who had been voting for the last forty years".&lt;ref name = "Abrahamian, p. 268-9"&gt;Abrahamian (1982), pp. 268–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ervand Abrahamian: "Realizing that the opposition would take the vast majority of the provincial seats, Mosaddegh stopped the voting as soon as 79 deputies – just enough to form a parliamentary quorum—had been elected."&lt;ref name = "Abrahamian 269"&gt;Abrahamian (1982), p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative account is offered by Stephen Kinzer. Beginning in the early 1950s under the guidance of [[Montague Woodhouse, 5th Baron Terrington|C.M. Woodhouse]], chief of the British intelligence station in Tehran, Britain's covert operations network had funneled roughly £10,000 per month to the Rashidian brothers (two of Iran's most influential royalists) in the hope of buying off, according to CIA estimates, "the armed forces, the Majlis (Iranian parliament), religious leaders, the press, street gangs, politicians and other influential figures".&lt;ref name = "Kinzer 150-1"&gt;Kinzer, All the Shah's Men, (2003) pp. 150-1.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in his statement asserting electoral manipulation by "foreign agents", Mosaddegh suspended the elections. His National Front party had made up 30 of the 79 deputies elected. Yet none of those present vetoed the statement, and the elections were postponed indefinitely. The 17th Majlis convened on February 1952.

Throughout Mossadegh's career, he strove to increase the power the people held versus the power of the crown.&lt;ref name="Westview Press"/&gt; In 1952, he was granted emergency powers by the [[Majlis]] which he used to diminish the amount of power the Shah held at the time. He used these powers to place the control of the armed forces under the government, to decrease the size of the armed forces, and introduce land reforms with a more socialist approach.

Tension soon began to escalate in the Majlis. Conservative opponents refused to grant Mosaddegh special powers to deal with the economic crisis caused by the sharp drop in revenue and voiced regional grievances against the capital Tehran, while the National Front waged "a propaganda war against the landed upper class".&lt;ref name="Abrahamian 268-70"/&gt;

===Resignation and uprising===
On 16 July 1952, during the royal approval of his new [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]], Mosaddegh insisted on the constitutional prerogative of the Prime Minister to name a Minister of War and the Chief of Staff, something the Shah had done up to that point. The Shah refused, seeing it as a means for Mosaddegh to consolidate his power over the government at the expense of the monarchy. In response, Mosaddegh announced his resignation appealing directly to the public for support, pronouncing that "in the present situation, the struggle started by the Iranian people cannot be brought to a victorious conclusion".&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian (1982), pp. 270–1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Veteran politician [[Ghavam os-Saltaneh|Ahmad Qavam]] (also known as Ghavam os-Saltaneh) was appointed as Iran's new Prime Minister. On the day of his appointment, he announced his intention to resume negotiations with the British to end the oil dispute, a reversal of Mosaddegh's policy. The National Front—along with various Nationalist, Islamist, and socialist parties and groups&lt;ref&gt;''Mosaddegh: The Years of Struggle and Opposition by Col. Gholamreza Nejati'', p. 761.&lt;/ref&gt;—including Tudeh—responded by calling for protests, assassinations of the Shah and other royalists, strikes and mass demonstrations in favor of Mosaddegh. Major strikes broke out in all of Iran's major towns, with the Bazaar closing down in Tehran. Over 250 demonstrators in Tehran, Hamadan, Ahvaz, Isfahan, and Kermanshah were killed or suffered serious injuries.&lt;ref&gt;, Abrahamian (1982), p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt;

After five days of mass demonstrations on ''Siyeh-i Tir'' (the 30th of Tir on the Iranian calendar), military commanders ordered their troops back to barracks, fearful of overstraining the enlisted men's loyalty and left Tehran in the hands of the protesters.&lt;ref name="Abrahamian 272"&gt;Abrahamian (1982), p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt; Frightened by the unrest, Shah dismissed Qavam and re-appointed Mosaddegh, granting him the full control of the military he had previously demanded.

===Reinstatement and emergency powers===
More popular than ever, a greatly strengthened Mosaddegh convinced parliament to grant him emergency powers for six months to "decree any law he felt necessary for obtaining not only financial solvency, but also electoral, judicial, and educational reforms".&lt;ref name=Abrahamian273&gt;Abrahamian (1982), p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt; Majlis deputies elected [[Ayatollah Abol-Ghasem Kashani]] as House Speaker. Kashani's Islamic scholars, as well as the [[Tudeh Party]], proved to be two of Mosaddegh's key political allies, although relations with both were often strained.

With his emergency powers, Mosaddegh tried to strengthen his newly-established autocracy by limiting the monarchy's powers,&lt;ref&gt;Zabih, Sepehr. The Mosaddegh Era: Roots of the Iranian Revolution, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; cutting the Shah's personal budget, forbidding him to communicate directly with foreign diplomats, transferring royal lands back to the state and expelling the Shah's politically active sister [[Ashraf Pahlavi]].&lt;ref name = "Abrahamian 272"/&gt;

In January 1953, Mosaddegh successfully pressed Parliament to extend his emergency powers for another 12 months. With these powers, he decreed a land reform law that established village councils and increased the peasants' share of production.&lt;ref name=Abrahamian273/&gt; This weakened the landed aristocracy, abolishing Iran's centuries-old feudal agriculture sector, replacing it with a system of collective farming and government land ownership, which centralized power in his government. Mosaddegh saw these reforms as a means of checking the power of the [[Tudeh Party]], which had been agitating for general land reform among the peasants. The Tudeh, on the other hand, quietly approved the short-circuiting of Iran’s nascent democratic institutions in the hope the newly created dictatorial powers would soon fall into their hands.

However, during this time Iranians were "becoming poorer and unhappier by the day" thanks to the British boycott. As Mosaddegh's political coalition began to fray, his enemies increased in number.&lt;ref&gt;, Kinzer, ''All the Shah's Men'' (2003) p.135-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Partly through the efforts of Iranians sympathizing with the British, and partly in fear of the growing dictatorial powers of the Prime Minister, several former members of Mosaddegh's coalition turned against him, fearing arrest. They included [[Mozzafar Baghai]], head of the worker-based Toilers party; [[Hossein Makki]], who had helped lead the takeover of the Abadan refinery and was at one point considered Mosaddegh's heir apparent; and most outspokenly Ayatollah Kashani, who damned Mosaddegh with the "vitriol he had once reserved for the British".&lt;ref&gt;Kinzer, ''All the Shah's Men'' (2003) p.159&lt;/ref&gt;On the other hands, the reason for difference of opinion among Makki and Mosaddegh was the sharp response of Mosaddegh to Kashani who was inoffensive scholar that attract the public supports, as Makki said. Hossein Makki strongly opposed the dissolution of the parliament by Mossadegh and evaluated in the long run at his loss because with the closure of the parliament, the right to dismiss the Prime minister was made by the Shah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Makki|first1=Hossein |title=Twenty-year-old history of Iran |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overthrow of Mosaddegh==
{{Main article|1953 Iranian coup d'état}}

===Plot to depose Mosaddegh===
The British government had grown increasingly distressed over Mosaddegh's policies and were especially bitter over the loss of their control of the Iranian oil industry. Repeated attempts to reach a settlement had failed, and, in October 1952, Mosaddegh declared Britain an enemy and cut all diplomatic relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=No traction for proposal to name street after Mosaddeq|url=http://en.mehrnews.com/news/29820/No-traction-for-proposal-to-name-street-after-Mosaddeq|agency=Mehr News Agency|accessdate=31 March 2017|language=en|date=9 September 2008|id=News ID: 2820572}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Until 1935; the Anglo-Persian Oil co had the exclusive rights to Iranian oil. in 1914, the British government controlled 51% of its shares and became a major shareholder. After converting Britain's fuel ships to oil, the corporation was considered vital to British national security and the company’s profits partially alleviated Britain’s budget deficit. Unsurprisingly, many Iranians resented the company's privileges and demanded a fair share of its takings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=ben |first1=cool |title=The Coup Against Iran’s Mohammad Mossadegh |url=https://adst.org/2015/07/the-coup-against-irans-mohammad-mossadegh/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Engulfed in a variety of problems following World War II, Britain was unable to resolve the issue single-handedly and looked towards the United States to settle the matter. Initially, the USA had opposed British policies. After mediation had failed several times to bring about a settlement, American Secretary of State [[Dean Acheson]] concluded that the British were "destructive, and determined on a rule-or-ruin policy in Iran."&lt;ref&gt;Saikal, Amin, ''The Rise and Fall of the Shah'', Princeton University Press, 1980, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

The American position shifted in late 1952 when [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] was elected U.S. President. In November and December, British intelligence officials suggested to American intelligence that the prime minister should be ousted. British prime minister [[Winston Churchill]] suggested to the incoming Eisenhower administration that Mossadegh, despite his open disgust with socialism, was, or would become, dependent on the pro-Soviet [[Tudeh Party]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meforum.org/article/1597 Review of ''All the Shah's Men'' by Jonathan Schanzer]{{failed verification|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in Iran "increasingly turning towards [[communism]]" and towards the Soviet sphere at a time of high [[Cold War]] fears.&lt;ref&gt;Mark J.

In the meantime, the already precarious alliance between Mosaddegh and Kashani was severed in January 1953, when Kashani opposed Mosaddegh's demand that his increased powers be extended for a period of one year. Finally, to eliminate Mossadegh's threat to prevent cheap oil supply to the West and the withdrawal of profitable oil reserves from the hands of Western companies, the US made an attempt to depose him. The domination of US over Iran was reminiscent of the access cancellation of [[Soviet]] to [[Persian Gulf]]. So the geographic location of Iran became important for the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=McQuade |first1=Joseph |title=How the CIA toppled Iranian democracy |url=https://theconversation.com/how-the-cia-toppled-iranian-democracy-81628}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Downing |first1=Larry |title=Documents reveal new details about CIA's role in 1953 coup in Iran |url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/08/20/documents-reveal-new-details-about-cia-role-in-153-coup-in-iran.html |website=foxnews }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operation Ajax===
[[File:Mossadegh US24.jpg|thumb|left|Mosaddegh at the [[Tomb of the Unknowns]] in Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia.]]

In March 1953, [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[John Foster Dulles]] directed the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), which was headed by his younger brother [[Allen Dulles]], to draft plans to overthrow Mossadegh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB28/|title=The Secret CIA History of the Iran Coup, 1953|publisher=George Washington University, quoting National security Archive Electronic Briefing Book No. 28|editor=Malcolm Byrne|date=2 November 2000|accessdate=7 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 April 1953, Allen Dulles approved $1 million to be used "in any way that would bring about the fall of Mosaddegh". Soon the CIA's [[Tehran]] station started to launch a propaganda campaign against Mossadegh. Finally, according to ''[[The New York Times]]'', in early June, American and British intelligence officials met again, this time in [[Beirut]], and put the finishing touches on the strategy. Soon afterward, according to his later published accounts, the chief of the CIA's Near East and Africa division, [[Kermit Roosevelt, Jr.]] the grandson of U.S. President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], arrived in Tehran to direct it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Fifties| last=Halberstam|first=David|authorlink=David Halberstam |year=1993|publisher=Ballantine Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-449-90933-1|pages=366–367| title-link=The Fifties (book)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, ''[[The New York Times]]'' made partial publication of a leaked CIA document titled ''Clandestine Service History – Overthrow of Premier Mosaddegh of Iran – November 1952-August 1953''.

The plot, known as Operation Ajax, centered on convincing Iran's monarch to issue a decree to dismiss Mosaddegh from office, as he had attempted some months earlier. But the Shah was terrified to attempt such a dangerously unpopular and risky move against Mosaddegh. It would take much persuasion and many U.S. funded meetings, which included bribing his sister Ashraf with a mink coat and money, to successfully change his mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=All The Shah's Men|last=Kinzer|first=Stephen|year=2003|publisher=John Wiley &amp;Sons |location=New Jersey|isbn= 978-0471265177|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mosaddegh became aware of the plots against him and grew increasingly wary of conspirators acting within his government.&lt;ref name="NYT1"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/library/world/mideast/041600iran-cia-chapter2.html Trying to Persuade a Reluctant Shah], ''New York Times'' 7 Dec. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Donald Wilber|Dr. Donald N. Wilber]], who was involved in the plot to remove Mossadegh from power, in early August, Iranian CIA operatives pretending to be socialists and nationalists threatened Muslim leaders with "savage punishment if they opposed Mossadegh," thereby giving the impression that Mossadegh was cracking down on dissent earlier than planned, and stirring anti-Mossadegh sentiments within the religious community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Risen|first1=James|title=SECRETS OF HISTORY: The C.I.A. in Iran -- A special report.; How a Plot Convulsed Iran in '53 (and in '79)|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/16/world/secrets-history-cia-iran-special-report-plot-convulsed-iran-53-79.html?pagewanted=3|accessdate=16 July 2015|work=New York Times|date=16 April 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Iranian parliamentary dissolution referendum, 1953|referendum to dissolve parliament]] and give the prime minister power to make law was submitted to voters, and it passed with 99 percent approval, 2,043,300 votes to 1300 votes against.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, ''Iran between 2 Revolutions'', 1982, (p.274)&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mark J. Gasiorowski, "There were separate polling stations for yes and no votes, producing sharp criticism of Mosaddeq" and that the "controversial referendum...gave the CIA's precoup propaganda campaign to show up Mosaddeq as an anti-democratic dictator an easy target".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gasiorowski|first1=Mark J.|title=Mohammad Mosaddeq and the 1953 coup in Iran|date=2004|publisher=Syracuse Univ.

===Overthrow===
In August 1953, the Shah finally agreed to Mossadegh's overthrow, after Roosevelt said that the United States would proceed with or without him,&lt;ref name="Roosevelt"&gt;Kermit Roosevelt Jr. ''Countercoup: The Struggle for the Control of Iran'' (McGraw-Hill, 1979) {{ISBN|0-07-053590-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and formally dismissed the prime minister in a written decree, an act that had been made part of the constitution during the Constitution Assembly of 1949, convened under martial law, at which time the power of the monarchy was increased in various ways by the Shah himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dUHhTPdJ6yIC&amp;pg=PT449|page=449|title=Iran at War: 1500–1988|last=Farrokh |first=Kaveh|year=2011|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=978-1780962214}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a precautionary measure, he flew to [[Baghdad]] and from there hid safely in Rome. He actually signed two decrees, one dismissing Mosaddegh and the other nominating the CIA's choice, General [[Fazlollah Zahedi]], as Prime Minister. These decrees, called ''[[Firman (decree)|Farmāns]]'', were specifically written as dictated by Donald Wilber, the CIA architect of the plan, and were designed as a major part of Wilber's strategy to give legitimacy to the coup, as can be read in the declassified plan itself, which bears his name.

[[File: Shaban jafari.jpg|right|thumb|Tehran strongman [[Shaban Jafari]] played a major role in Mossadegh's overthrow.]]
Soon, massive popular protests, aided by Roosevelt's team, took place across the city and elsewhere with tribesmen at the ready to assist the coup. Anti- and pro-monarchy protesters, both paid by Roosevelt,&lt;ref name="Roosevelt"/&gt; violently clashed in the streets, looting and burning mosques and newspapers, leaving almost 300 dead. The pro-monarchy leadership, chosen, hidden and finally unleashed at the right moment by the CIA team, led by retired army General and former Minister of Interior in Mosaddegh's cabinet, [[Fazlollah Zahedi]] joined with underground figures such as the Rashidian brothers and local strongman [[Shaban Jafari]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pahlavani.com/ish/html/ph/new/phmis.htm|title=Pahlavani: Misinformation, Misconceptions and Misrepresentations|work=pahlavani.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; to gain the upper hand on 19 August 1953 (28 Mordad). The military joined on cue: pro-Shah tank regiments stormed the capital and bombarded the prime minister's official residence, on Roosevelt's cue, according to his book. Mosaddegh managed to flee from the mob that set in to ransack his house, and, the following day, surrendered to General Zahedi, who was meanwhile set up by the CIA with makeshift headquarters at the Officers' Club. Mosaddegh was arrested at the Officers' Club and transferred to a military jail shortly after.&lt;ref name="NYT3"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/library/world/mideast/041600iran-cia-chapter4.html C.I.A. and Moscow Are Both Surprised], ''New York Times'' 7 Dec. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 August, the Shah returned from Rome.

Zahedi's new government soon reached an agreement with foreign oil companies to form a consortium and "restore the flow of Iranian oil to world markets in substantial quantities", giving the United States and Great Britain the lion's share of the restored British holdings. In return, the US massively funded the Shah's resulting government, until the [[Iranian Revolution|Shah's overthrow]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/world/mideast/080654iran-statements.html|date=6 August 1954|title=Statements on Iran Oil Accord|publisher=The New York Times|author=Associated Press|accessdate=7 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As soon as the coup succeeded, many of Mosaddegh's former associates and supporters were tried, imprisoned, and tortured. Some were sentenced to death and executed.&lt;ref&gt;The Modern Middle East: A Political History Since the First World War, [[University of California Press]], 2011-01-03, by Mehran Kamrava, page 148&lt;/ref&gt; The minister of foreign affairs and the closest associate of Mosaddegh, [[Hossein Fatemi]], was executed by order of the Shah's military court.

===Trial and final years===
[[File:Mohammad Mosaddeq, Ahmadabad 1965.jpg|thumb|upright|Mossadegh under [[house arrest]] in Ahmadabad]]

On 21 December 1953, he was sentenced to three years' solitary confinement in a military prison, well short of the death sentence requested by prosecutors. Upon hearing of his sentence Mossadegh is reported to have said "The verdict of this court has increased my historical glories. I am extremely grateful you convicted me. Truly tonight the Iranian nation understood the meaning of constitutionalism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Welles |last=Hangen|date=22 December 1952|title= Mossadegh Gets 3-Year Jail Term|work=[[The New York Times]]|url= http://partners.nytimes.com/library/world/mideast/122253iran-jail.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was kept under [[house arrest]] at his [[Ahmadabad-e Mosaddeq|Ahmadabad]] residence, until his death on 5 March 1967.

[[File:Bakhtiar and mosaddegh cartoon.jpg|thumbnail|[[Shahpour Bakhtiar|Bakhtiar]] and Mosaddegh cartoon in [[Ettelaat|Ettelaat newspaper]] 22 January 1978.]]

The secret U.S. overthrow of Mosaddegh served as a rallying point in anti-US protests during the 1979 [[Iranian Revolution]], and to this day he is one of the most popular figures in Iranian history.&lt;ref name="Noreena Hertz 2003, Page 88"&gt;Noreena Hertz, ''The Silent Takeover: Global Capitalism and the Death of Democracy'', HarperCollins, 2003, {{ISBN|0-06-055973-X}}, Page 88&lt;/ref&gt;

The withdrawal of support for Mosaddegh by the powerful Shia clergy has been regarded as having been motivated by their fear of the chaos of a communist takeover.&lt;ref name = "Nasr 124"&gt;Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival'', Norton (2006), p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that while many elements of Mosaddegh's coalition abandoned him it was the loss of support from [[Abol-Ghasem Kashani|Ayatollah Abol-Ghasem Kashani]] and another clergy that was fatal to his cause, reflective of the dominance of the [[Ulema]] in Iranian society and a portent of the Islamic Revolution to come. The loss of the political clerics effectively cut Mosaddegh's connections with the lower middle classes and the Iranian masses which are crucial to any popular movement in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;Mackay, Sandra, ''The Iranians'', Plume (1997), p. 203, 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S.===

[[File: President Truman and Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh of Iran.TIF|thumb|Prime Minister Mosaddegh with US [[President Truman]] in 1951]]
The US role in Mosaddegh's overthrow was not formally acknowledged for many years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sanchez |first1=Raf |title=British diplomats tried to suppress details of a MI6 role in Iran coup |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/10253384/British-diplomats-tried-to-suppress-details-of-MI6-role-in-Iran-coup.html |website=telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the Eisenhower administration vehemently opposed Mossadegh's policies. President Eisenhower wrote angrily about Mosaddegh in his memoirs, describing him as impractical and naive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Allen-Ebrahimian |first1=Bethany |title=64 Years Later, CIA Finally Releases Details of Iranian Coup |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/06/20/64-years-later-cia-finally-releases-details-of-iranian-coup-iran-tehran-oil/ |website=foreignpolicy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, the CIA's involvement with the coup was exposed. This caused controversy within the organization and the CIA congressional hearings of the 1970s. CIA supporters maintained that the coup was strategically necessary, and praised the efficiency of the agents responsible. Critics say the scheme was paranoid, colonial, illegal, and immoral—and truly caused the "blowback" suggested in the pre-coup analysis. The extent of this "blowback," over time, was not completely clear to the CIA, as they had an inaccurate picture of the stability of the Shah's regime. The [[Iranian Revolution]] of 1979 caught the CIA and the US very much off guard (as CIA reporting a mere month earlier predicted no imminent insurrectionary turbulence whatsoever for the Shah's regime), and resulted in the overthrow of the Shah by a fundamentalist faction opposed to the US, headed by [[Ayatollah Khomeini]]. In retrospect, not only did the CIA and the US underestimate the extent of popular discontent for the Shah, but much of that discontent historically stemmed from the removal of Mosaddegh and the subsequent clientelism of the Shah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Norton-Taylor |first1=Richard |title=CIA admits role in 1953 Iranian coup |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/19/cia-admits-role-1953-iranian-coup |website=theguardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In March 2000, Secretary of State [[Madeleine Albright]] stated her regret that Mosaddegh was ousted: "The Eisenhower administration believed its actions were justified for strategic reasons. But the coup was clearly a setback for Iran's political development and it is easy to see now why many Iranians continue to resent this intervention by America."&lt;ref name="All the Shah's Men"/&gt; In the same year, ''[[The New York Times]]'' published a detailed report about the coup based on declassified CIA documents.&lt;ref name="jrisen"/&gt;

===British===

Mossadeq's overthrow had a direct relationship with the creation of an Islamic revolution and the collapse of the Pahlavi government. America's close relationship with the Shah and the subsequent hostility of the United States to the Islamic Republic and Britain's profitable interventions caused pessimism for Iranians, stirring nationalism and suspicion of foreign interference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Norton-Taylor |first1=Richard |title=CIA admits role in 1953 Iranian coup |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/19/cia-admits-role-1953-iranian-coup |website=theguardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Liberal Party''', known until 1948 as the '''Liberal National Party''', was a [[liberalism|liberal]] political party in the [[United Kingdom]] from 1931 to 1968. It broke away from the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], and later co-operated and merged with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]].

==History==
The Liberal Nationals evolved as a distinctive group within the Liberal Party when the main body of Liberals maintained in office the second [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government of [[Ramsay MacDonald]], who lacked a majority in Parliament. A growing number of Liberal MPs led by Sir [[John Simon, 1st Viscount Simon|John Simon]] declared their total opposition to this policy and began to co-operate more closely with the Conservative Party, even advocating a policy of replacing free trade with tariffs, anathema to many traditional Liberals. By June 1931 three Liberal MPs — Simon, [[Ernest Brown (MP)|Ernest Brown]] and [[Robert Hutchison, 1st Baron Hutchison of Montrose|Robert Hutchison]] (a former [[Lloyd George ministry]]-supporting coalitionist of the earlier [[National Liberal Party (UK, 1922)|National Liberal Party]]) — resigned their party's whip and sat as independents.

When the Labour Government was replaced by a makeshift, emergency (though to prove long-lasting) [[UK National Government|National Government]] in August 1931, dissident Liberals were temporarily reconciled with the rest of their party within it; but in the next two months the party's acting leader, [[Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel|Herbert Samuel]], came close to resigning from the government over the National Government's proposal to call a snap general election, fearing that it would lead to a majority for the Conservatives and the abolition of free trade. However, he was undermined by the willingness of those Liberals such as Simon – who ''in extremis'' would support [[protectionism]] – to continue to support the National Government and even to take the vacant offices to ensure it retained a broad party base. Samuel was welcomed back into the new National Government subject to an agreed concession to fight the general election on a separate Liberal Party manifesto, but staunch supporters of the National Government were prepared to repudiate free trade.

===Split of the Liberal Party in 1931===
Witnessing the rise of cheap foreign goods, the party split over how they would negotiate over ardent Conservative [[protectionism]]: supporters formed the '''Liberal National Party''' in the run-up to the [[United Kingdom general election, 1931|1931 general election]] in October. A third group under the official leader, [[David Lloyd George]], also emerged, the [[Independent Liberals (UK, 1931)|Independent Liberals]], who opposed the National Government completely, but this had few adherents amongst prominent Liberals beyond Lloyd George's relatives. For the next election in 1935 they reunited with the mainstream Liberals, colloquially dubbed "Samuelites".

Following the election, Liberals following John Simon formally repudiated the official Liberal Party in Parliament and operated to all extents and purposes as a separate party group, known as "Simonites", though they were not immediately fully recognised as such. In 1932 the "Samuelite" Liberals resigned from the government over the result of the [[Ottawa Conference]] – the introduction of a series of tariff agreements – though they continued to support the National Government from the back benches. By 1933 they had abandoned it completely and crossed the floor of the House of Commons, leaving the Liberal Nationals supporting the government. The two groups were now completely separate, though some Liberal MPs like [[Robert Bernays]] remained on the Government benches before officially joining the Liberal Nationals, and other MPs maintained links across the floor.

[[image:Viscount Runciman of Doxford.JPG|thumb|left|[[Walter Runciman, 1st Viscount Runciman of Doxford|Walter Runciman]], a key Liberal National but President of the Liberal Party's Federation until 1936]]
Within the wider party the split was not so clear. Liberal Associations which supported Liberal National candidates remained affiliated to the [[National Liberal Federation]], the mainstream body for the official party, until that body was dissolved in 1936; in particular one Liberal National cabinet minister, [[Walter Runciman, 1st Viscount Runciman of Doxford|Walter Runciman]] elected in 1899, of a wealthy shipping family, remained its President even after the Commons split. Its replacement, the Liberal National Council, the main organ of the local (extra-parliamentary) party, was founded in 1936. However, there were increasing divisions when some Liberal associations endorsed Liberal Nationals, especially at by-elections: frequently Independent Liberals came forward to oppose such a candidate endorsed by the local association that called itself 'Liberal' but was actually Liberal National.

Throughout the 1930s and 1940s there were a number of proposals to reunite the two Liberal parties, but these routinely foundered on the question of continued support for the National Government. During [[World War II]] the Liberal Nationals suffered a stream of defectors who joined either the independent Liberals or the Conservatives, or else became non-party supporters of the government. In 1940 the National Government was replaced by an all-party coalition led by [[Winston Churchill]]; the Liberal Nationals were marginalised, with Simon "kicked upstairs" to become [[Lord Chancellor]]. The party's new leader, [[Ernest Brown (MP)|Ernest Brown]], was only occasionally accorded the status of a party leader within the coalition and otherwise faced questions over the future of the party. Proposals emerged again for the party to reunite with the independent Liberals, but these foundered on Brown's insistence on supporting a revival of the National Government once the Coalition broke up, which the independent Liberals rejected.

After both parties' drubbing and the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party's]] victory in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945 general election]], the two factions made renewed attempts at reuniting. At Westminster the core, independent [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]]s were in a shattered state, their tiny numbers representing all shades of opinion; and it was doubtful that the new leader, [[Clement Davies]] (himself a former Liberal National who had defected back to the independent Liberals) could carry all of his colleagues into a united party. Only in London (where neither Liberal party had any MPs) were the two reunited at regional organisational level, although in some individual boroughs and constituencies such as [[Huddersfield]] rival Liberal associations began co-operating and eventually merging as avowed{{clarify|date=November 2015}} Liberal associations. At the same time there were calls from devout Liberal Nationals, who had co-operated closely with the Conservatives and received numerous ministerial posts in the four National Governments, for that entire wing to fully unify with the Conservatives, with whom they had rarely expressed any overt divergence of opinion — few political commentators discerned a difference between the two.

===Merger with the Conservative Party===
In May 1947, the Woolton-Teviot agreement between [[Frederick Marquis, 1st Earl of Woolton|Lord Woolton]] (for the Conservatives) and [[Charles Iain Kerr, 1st Baron Teviot|Lord Teviot]] (for the Liberal Nationals) resulted in the two parties merging at the constituency level. The Liberal Nationals also changed their name to National Liberals at this stage. Their reluctance to take this label originally is said to be a reaction to Lloyd George's use of the name for the earlier National Liberal Party in the 1920s.

The National Liberals therefore fought the next five British general elections as allies of the Conservative Party. To confuse matters, their candidates stood for election with a variety of names including National Liberal, Liberal National, National Liberal and Conservative, Liberal and Conservative and so on. Even established Conservatives with little or no former connection to the original party (including [[Randolph Churchill]]) after 1950 used the National Liberal name when going forward as candidates in some wards and constituencies.

===Immediate consequences for the Liberal Party===
Even more than before 1947, the appearance of National Liberal candidates aggrieved the Liberal Party. They saw this as a blatant misappropriation by the Conservative Party of not only much of their funds but also their historic party name, while the Liberals themselves were in a parlous political position. In 1951 it was only thanks to fraught local arrangements that five of the six remaining Liberal MPs were elected in the absence of a Conservative candidate. Two of these elections were achieved by formal local pacts, whereby only one Liberal or Conservative candidate would stand in each constituency (in [[Bolton]] and [[Huddersfield]]). Increasingly, with [[electoral deposit]]s expensive and electoral support low, the Liberal Party fielded few candidates, especially in 1951 and 1955 when the party barely mustered over 100 to stand for Parliament.

===Consequences for the National Liberal Party===
While the Liberal Party struggled to survive, National Liberals won 17 seats in the 1950 general election. In subsequent elections their numbers increased to 19 (1951), 21 (1955) and 19 (1959) continuing their new status as the larger of the two Liberal groupings in Parliament.

During this period two National Liberals held cabinet rank, plus one who sat as a "Liberal":

* [[John Scott Maclay, 1st Viscount Muirshiel]] was [[Secretary of State for Scotland]] from 1957 to 1962 until sacked (with six other Cabinet ministers) by Prime Minister [[Harold Macmillan]].
* [[Charles Hill, Baron Hill of Luton|Charles Hill]], best known for his work in the 1940s as the Radio Doctor giving nutritional advice on the [[BBC Home Service]], stood as an Independent in the 1945 general election, but then won the [[Luton]] parliamentary seat as a Conservative and National Liberal in 1950. He was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Food in 1951; from 1957 to 1961 he was Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster; and from 1961 he was Minister of Housing and Local Government and Welsh Affairs. He lost his place in the Cabinet in Harold Macmillan's reshuffle in 1962.
* [[Gwilym Lloyd George]], MP for [[Pembrokeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Pembrokeshire]] 1922–1950 and for [[Newcastle upon Tyne North (UK Parliament constituency)|Newcastle upon Tyne North]] 1951-1957, had moved away from the Liberal Party by 1946 (though in 1945 he was separately offered the position of party leader by the Liberals and by the Liberal Nationals). He sat as a Liberal, but joined Winston Churchill on the opposition [[frontbencher|front bench]]. Unusually, he never formally joined the National Liberals, and while not sitting on the government benches in 1931, had been independent of the Liberal Party whip since that year and ultimately accepted a junior post in the [[Neville Chamberlain]] National Government administration in 1939. He served as [[Home Secretary]] from 1954 to 1957.

==Merger==
By the early 1960s it was obvious there was very little point to the continued separate political existence of the National Liberals. A joint Conservative and National Liberal candidate ([[Michael_Shaw,_Baron_Shaw_of_Northstead|Michael Shaw]]) gained a seat from the opposition Labour Party in a [[Brighouse and Spenborough by-election, 1960|by-election]] in [[Brighouse and Spenborough (UK Parliament constituency)|Brighouse and Spenborough]] in 1960. In 1962 [[Ian_Gilmour,_Baron_Gilmour_of_Craigmillar|Ian Gilmour]] who later achieved Conservative party cabinet status defended the National Liberal seat of [[Central Norfolk (UK Parliament constituency)|Central Norfolk]] as that party's candidate in a by-election.  Another noteworthy National Liberal candidate in this time period was the future Deputy Prime Minister [[Michael Heseltine]] who had stood as a National Liberal for Gower in 1959, then went on to stand as a Conservative for more winnable seats in the 1960s.

After 1962 the party lacked a senior government presence; and with the retirement or death of former leaders, only six with the National Liberal label were elected in the general election of 1964. A further four who had sat with this label preferred to be elected under a 'straight' Conservative label. The post of chairman of the parliamentary party was filled by the former junior minister [[David Renton]], the MP for [[Huntingdon]] since 1945, with veteran National Liberal [[Herbert Butcher]] (who sat for the seat of [[Holland with Boston]]) remaining their chief whip. Butcher retired before the 1966 general election, in which the National Liberals were reduced to just three MPs (including the future Conservative Party cabinet minister [[John Nott]]). Two others ([[Joan Vickers]] and [[John Osborn (politician)|John Osborn]]) were elected as Conservatives. With so few MPs, they agreed to give up to the Liberal party a room at the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster Parliament]] that they had used for their meetings.

In its last years, the party was used by architect [[John Poulson]] as a way into politics while not being fully committed to the Conservatives. Poulson, who was Chairman of the National Liberal Council's Executive Committee from 1964, had little political skill, and his speeches were written by a [[Scottish Office]] civil servant, George Pottinger, who was on his payroll. However, the party had lost most of its senior members; and in 1968 the remaining National Liberals, still led by David Renton, assimilated completely into the Conservative Party.

The '''Opal Storage Specification''' is a set of specifications for features of data storage devices (such as disk drives) that enhance their security.  For example, it defines a way of encrypting the stored data so that an unauthorized person who gains possession of the device cannot see the data.  That is, it is a specification for [[Hardware-based full disk encryption|self-encrypting drives]] (SED).

The specification is published by the [[Trusted Computing Group]] Storage Workgroup.

== SSC Overview==
{{unsourced section|date=May 2017}}
The Opal SSC (Security Subsystem Class) is an implementation profile for Storage Devices built to:
* Protect the confidentiality of stored user data against unauthorized access once it leaves the owner's control (involving a power cycle and subsequent deauthentication).
* Enable interoperability between multiple SD vendors.

== Functions ==
{{unsourced section|date=May 2017}}
The Opal SSC encompasses these functions:
* Security provider support
* Interface communication protocol
* Cryptographic features
* Authentication
* Table management
* Access control and personalization
* Issuance
* SSC discovery

== Features ==
{{unsourced section|date=May 2017}}
* Security Protocol 1 support
* Security Protocol 2 support
* Communications
* Protocol stack reset commands

== Security ==

Most of OPAL hardware securities weakness relies in firmware implementation.

The '''Pro-Euro Conservative Party''' was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[political party]] announced by [[John Stevens (English politician)|John Stevens]] and [[Brendan Donnelly (politician)|Brendan Donnelly]] in February 1999, formed to contest the [[European Parliament election, 1999 (United Kingdom)|1999 European Parliament Elections]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB928960615185249216?mod=googlewsj|title=The Challenge Awaiting Britain's Conservatives|last=Stevens|first=John|date=10 June 1999|work=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=2009-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=split&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/proeuro-party-threatens-to-split-tories-1072222.html|title=Pro-Euro party threatens to split Tories|last=Wolff|first=Marie|date=21 February 1999|work=The Independent|accessdate=2009-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The founders were Members of the [[European Parliament]] who had resigned from the [[Conservative Party (UK)|UK Conservative Party]]&lt;ref name=bbcprofile&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/events/euros_99/parties_and_issues/349285.stm|title=Pro-Euro Conservative Party|date=28 May 1999|work=BBC News|accessdate=2009-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; in protest at its anti-[[euro]] stance.&lt;ref name=split/&gt; Their reported aim was to replace the [[Euroscepticism in the United Kingdom|Eurosceptic]] Conservative leadership of [[William Hague]] with that of [[Kenneth Clarke]].&lt;ref name=confusion/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/20/news/20iht-brit.2.t_4.html |title=Euro Is Emerging Again As a Key British Issue |last=Buerkle |first=Tom |date=20 May 1999 |work=New York Times |accessdate=2009-08-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150519020104/http://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/20/news/20iht-brit.2.t_4.html |archivedate=19 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stevens later said that they had intended to push Ken Clarke, [[Michael Heseltine]], [[Chris Patten]] and other [[Pro-Europeanism|pro-Europeans]] in the Conservative Party into "an [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|SDP]]-style breakaway, in combination with the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]".&lt;ref name=joining/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/jun/13/conservatives.uk3|title=Make the break, Ken|last=Stevens|first=John|date=13 June 2001|work=The Guardian|accessdate=2009-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party disbanded in 2001.&lt;ref name=breakaway/&gt;

==Policies==
The party said it was "based on traditional Conservative values", and they self-defined as "[[One Nation Conservatism|One Nation Conservatives]]".&lt;ref name=joining/&gt; The main aim of the party was for the United Kingdom to join the [[euro]], also known as "the single currency",&lt;ref name=bbcprofile/&gt; for economic reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/jun/08/uk.voterapathy|title=Victory for apathy feared|last=White|first=Michael|date=8 June 1999|work=The Guardian|accessdate=2009-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time the British pound was strong against the euro, which had dropped in value to be equal to the US dollar, and the then-Governor of the Bank of England Eddie George said that it would be "an act of faith" for Britain to join the [[Eurozone]].&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt;

John Stevens received 3.8% of the vote as the PECP candidate in the [[Kensington and Chelsea by-election, 1999|1999 Kensington &amp; Chelsea by-election]] against [[Michael Portillo]].

[[File:Scipio Africanus Major.jpg|thumb|[[Scipio Africanus]], one of Rome's greatest commanders, was a proconsul during the [[Second Punic War]]. He was one of the few proconsuls who did not first serve as consul.]]
A '''proconsul''' was an official of [[ancient Rome]] who acted on behalf of a [[Roman consul|consul]]. A proconsul was typically a former consul. The term is also used in recent history for officials with delegated authority.

In the [[Roman Republic]], military command, or ''[[imperium]]'', could be exercised constitutionally only by a consul. There were two consuls at a time, each elected to a one-year term. They could not normally serve two terms in a row. If a military campaign was in progress at the end of a consul's term, the consul in command might be appointed as proconsul by the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] when his term expired. This custom allowed for continuity of command despite the high turnover of consuls. In the [[Roman Empire]], proconsul was a title held by a civil governor and did not imply military command.

In modern times, various officials with notable delegated authority have been referred to as proconsuls. Studies of leadership typically divide leaders into policymakers and subordinate administrators. The proconsul occupies a position between these two categories. Max Weber classified leadership as [[Traditional authority|traditional]], [[Rational-legal authority|rational-legal]] (bureaucratic), and [[Charismatic authority|charismatic]]. A proconsul could be both a rule-following bureaucrat and charismatic personality. The rise of bureaucracy and rapid communication has reduced the scope for proconsular freelancing.&lt;ref name=Lord2&gt;Lord, Carnes, ''[https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1107009618 Proconsuls: Delegated Political-Military Leadership from Rome to America Today]'', 2012, Cambridge University Press, p. 2. {{ISBN|978-0-521-25469-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:CILI(2)p47fgtXXFastitriumphales.jpg|thumb|A tablet of ''Acta Triumphalia'' is displayed in the Capitoline Museums in Rome. This fragment covers the consulship of [[Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Asina|Asina]] and [[Gaius Duilius|Duilius]] (260 BC). Two proconsuls are mentioned, C.A. Quillius and M.A. Lucius.]]
The Latin word ''prōconsul'' is a shortened form of ''prō consule'', meaning "(one acting) for the consul."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED | proconsul }}&lt;/ref&gt; It appears on inscriptions beginning in 135 BC.&lt;ref name=pauly&gt;{{cite web|title=Proconsul|url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/brill-s-new-pauly/proconsul-e1009260#e1009270|website=[[Brill's New Pauly]]|accessdate=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient historians describe [[Quintus Publilius Philo]], the first proconsul, as ''prō consule'' for 326 BC.&lt;ref&gt;''Acta Triumphalia'' (CIL I.p.45), Livy (4–41.10; 8.23.12), and Suetonius (''Jul.'' 51.4). See Glare, P. G. W., et al., "consul, 1c" ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=OJgaAQAAMAAJ Oxford Latin Dictionary]'', 1982, Oxford: Clarendon press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-958031-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For later proconsuls, the same sources use the shortened form.&lt;ref&gt;''Acta Triumphalia'' 24 (CIL I.p.48), Livy (10.16.2), and Suetonius (''Aug.'' 47). See Glare, "prōconsul."&lt;/ref&gt;

==In leadership theory==
Although "proconsul" is an official title only with respect to [[magistrates of ancient Rome]], the word has also been applied to various British, U.S., and French officials. In the modern context, it is rarely a compliment. The terms ''[[satrap]]'' (from Persian) and ''[[viceroy]]'' (from French) are both used in a similar way.&lt;ref name="Lord2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED|viceroy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the gulf between ancient and modern proconsuls, writer Carnes Lord has proposed a single definition to allow the phenomenon to be analyzed in the context of leadership theory: "delegated political-military leadership that rises in the best case to statesmanship".&lt;ref&gt;Lord, Carnes, "[http://www.themontrealreview.com/2009/Proconsuls-Delegated-Political-Military-Leadership-from-Rome-to-America-Today.php "On Proconsular Leadership]", ''The Montréal Review'', September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; South African historian John Benyon defines a proconsul as a leader with "semi-independent and extraordinary capacity to shape the periphery" of an empire.&lt;ref&gt;Lord, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern writing on leadership tends to stress the distinction between "administration" on the one hand and "policy" on the other. This emphasis can be traced to an essay by [[Woodrow Wilson]] written in the late 19th century. In earlier epochs, it was common for leaders to combine the two roles. Since this is no longer the case, specific terminology is required to describe such officials.&lt;ref name="Lord2" /&gt;

In his classic study, [[Max Weber]] distinguished among three modes of legitimate governance: traditional, rational-legal, and charismatic. In the form of bureaucracy, the rational-legal mode is dominant in the modern world. But a modern proconsul may also resort to aristocratic, or charismatic, leadership.&lt;ref name=Lord3-4&gt;Lord, p. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Roman Republic]], a proconsul was typically a former consul and thus an experienced commander-in-chief. Having held the Republic's highest office, he was a statesman as well as an administrator. Rome's [[patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician class]] was prepared to exercise aristocratic leadership, both civil and military.

Several factors are said to limit the scope of proconsular authority in modern times. Democracies put the military under civilian authority and tend to avoid policymaking by military leaders. Modern government emphasizes bureaucracy and rulemaking, while the Romans were aristocratic. Finally, modern communications allows for greater central control.&lt;ref name=Lord3&gt;Lord, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although transoceanic telegraph lines were laid by the mid-19th century, Lord describes the late 19th century as the heyday of British proconsular authority. [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Lord Curzon]] in India, [[Frederick Lugard, 1st Baron Lugard|Frederick Lugard]] in Nigeria, [[Cecil Rhodes]] in South Africa, and [[Evelyn Baring, 1st Earl of Cromer|Cromer]] in Egypt all took imperial initiatives that London approved only reluctantly.&lt;ref name=Lord14&gt;Lord, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; As ruler of Japan and Korea after World War II, U.S. General [[Douglas MacArthur]] consciously modeled himself on a Roman aristocrat.&lt;ref name="Lord3-4" /&gt;

The role of U.S. General [[David Petraeus]] and others in Iraq suggests a continued need for proconsular leadership, according to Lord.&lt;ref name=Lord21&gt;Lord, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern technology makes communication easier than ever. But as email and Power Point presentations proliferate, clarity and intellectual discipline is lost.&lt;ref&gt;Lord, pp. 4–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Another factor is that civilian policymakers, whether on the spot or in the metropole, may lack the skills needed to manage military forces.&lt;ref name=Lord21&gt;Lord, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet proconsuls are at best an ''ad hoc'' solution to a reoccurring problem. Managing a large territory in occupation or conflict requires a range of skills and the ability to deal with various organizations. No one is trained as a proconsul and the available administrators have experience in at most one relevant agency or service. During the Vietnam War, the U.S. attempted to deal with this issue by creating an integrated civilian-military command structure called Civil Operations and Revolutionary Development Support (CORDS).&lt;ref&gt;Lord, p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roman Republic==
A proconsul was endowed with full consular authority outside the city of Rome.&lt;ref name="pauly" /&gt; [[Cicero]] notes that this did not include the right to consult [[auguries]]: "Our ancestors would not undertake any military enterprise without consulting the auspices; but now, for many years, our wars have been conducted by pro-consuls and propraetors, who do not have the right to take auspices."&lt;ref&gt;Cic. Div. 2,76.&lt;/ref&gt;

The position was created to deal with a constitutional peculiarity of the Roman Republic. Only a consul could command an army, but the high turnover of consuls could disrupt continuity of command. If a consul's term ended in the midst of a campaign, he could be appointed proconsul and continue to command.&lt;ref&gt;Lord, pp. 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Publilius was one of two consuls for the year 327&amp;nbsp;BC. When his term expired at the end of the year, his army was in the midst of besieging the city of Neapolis (modern [[Naples]]). Rather than risk a change of command at such a delicate moment, the Popular Assembly voted that he should "conduct the campaign in place of a consul (''prō consule'')" after his term expired. Publilius thus became the first proconsul.&lt;ref&gt;Lord, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Roman government}}
With imperial expansion beyond Italy and the annexation of territories as Roman provinces, the proconsul became one of the three types of Roman provincial governors. The others were the [[praetor]] and the [[propraetor]].&lt;ref name=Livy&gt;Livy, ''The History of Rome'', 8.22–23, 9.42, 410.16.1–2&lt;br /&gt;Dionysius of Halicarnassus, ''Roman antiquities,'' 17/18.4.5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In theory, proconsuls held delegated authority and acted on behalf of the consuls. In practice, a proconsulship was often treated as an extension of a consul's term. This extension applied only outside the city walls of Rome. It was an extension of the military command of the consul, but not of his public office.&lt;ref name="Livy" /&gt;

As the number of [[Roman legion]]s was increased, there was a need to increase the number of military commanders. The office of the [[praetor]] was introduced in 366 BC. The praetors were the chief justices of the city. They were also given ''imperium'' so that they could also command an army.&lt;ref name="Livy" /&gt;

During the [[Second Samnite War]], Rome increased the number of her legions. The position of propraetor was instituted. These were praetors whose ''imperium'' was extended and were given the task to command a reserve army. Propraetors had the power to command one army, whereas proconsuls had the power to command two armies.&lt;ref name="Livy" /&gt;

In 307 BC, [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Rullianus]], who was consul the previous year, was elected as proconsul to conduct the campaign in [[Samnium]]. During the [[Third Samnite War]] (298–290 BC) the consuls of the previous year, Quintus Fabius Maximus Rullianus and [[Publius Decius Mus (consul 312 BC)|Publius Decius Mus]], were given a six-month extension of their authority to carry on the war in Samnium. In 291 BC [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Gurges (consul 292 BC)|Quintus Fabius Maximus Gurges]] had his command extended and to carry out mop up operations towards the end of the war. He defeated the [[Pentri]], the largest [[Samnites|Samnite]] tribe.&lt;ref name="Livy" /&gt;

There were two republican proconsuls who did not previously hold the position of consul. During the [[Second Punic War]] (218–201 BC) [[Scipio Africanus]] volunteered to lead the second Roman expedition against the [[Carthaginians]] in Spain. He was too young to have been a consul. He was made proconsul by a vote of the Popular Assembly. When Scipio left Spain after his victory in 205 BC, [[Lucius Cornelius Lentulus]] and [[Lucius Manlius Acidinus]] were sent as commanders without public office (''sine magistratus''). This was done because Manlius Acidinus had not been a consul before.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, J. S, Hispaniae, ''Spain and the development of Roman Imperialism, 218–82 BC,'' pp. 64–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Rome acquired territory, the need for provincial governors grew. The province of [[Sicilia (Roman province)|Sicily]] was created in 241 BC, while Corsica and Sardinia was created in 238 BC. In 227&amp;nbsp;BC, two praetors were assigned the administration of these two provinces. Two more praetors were added when the provinces of [[Hispania Citerior]] and [[Hispania Ulterior]] were created in 197&amp;nbsp;BC. After this, no praetors were added even when the number of provinces increased. It became customary to extend the authority of consuls and the praetors at the end of their annual terms. The provinces were assigned by lot to proconsuls and propraetors. The proconsuls were assigned the provinces which contained the larger number of troops.&lt;ref name=Livy418&gt;Livy, ''The History of Rome'', 41.8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [[Lex Sempronia Agraria|Lex Sempronia]], enacted in 133 BC, the senate determined the allocation of the provinces before the next consular elections.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''de provinciis consularibus oratio'', 2, 7; ''pro Balbo'' 27, 61&lt;/ref&gt; In 81 BC, [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla|Sulla]] added two praetors so that the two proconsuls and six propraetors could be assigned to govern the ten provinces Rome ruled at that time.&lt;ref name="Livy418" /&gt; Sulla made the governorships annual and required the holder to leave the province within thirty days after the arrival of his successor.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Letters to Friends'', 3.6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 67 BC, [[Pompey]] [[Lex Gabinia|received]] extraordinary powers and an unprecedented multiyear proconsulship to deal with the problem of piracy. The "[[first triumvirate]]" of [[Julius Caesar]], Pompey and [[Crassus]] also received multiyear proconsulships in 59 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Lord, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roman Empire==
Under the Republic, consuls and proconsuls had raised and commanded armies loyal to themselves. [[Augustus]], Rome's first emperor, replaced these essentially private armies with a standing imperial army. The consuls and proconsuls lost their military authority, but the titles retained considerable prestige.&lt;ref&gt;Lord, pp. 24, 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

The provinces were divided between [[imperial provinces]], which were under the jurisdiction of the emperor, and [[senatorial provinces]], which were under the jurisdiction of the senate. The imperial provinces were mostly the border provinces, where most of the legions were stationed. This allowed the emperor to retain control of the army. In the senatorial provinces, the governors were called proconsuls. Tenure was generally restricted to one year.&lt;ref name=Lord46&gt;Lord, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Suetonius]]:
{{cquote|The more important provinces, which could not with ease or safety be entrusted to the government of annual magistrates, [Augustus] reserved for his own administration: the rest he distributed by lot amongst the proconsuls; but sometimes he made exchanges, and frequently visited most of both kinds in person.&lt;ref&gt;C. Suetonius Tranquillus, ''Divus Augustus'', 47.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Augustus decreed that the governors of the senatorial provinces would receive the title proconsul, regardless of whether they had served as praetor or consul. These were chosen by lot, with the result ratified by the Senate. In the imperial provinces, the emperors appointed governors who held the title of ''[[legatus Augusti pro praetore]]'', or pro-praetor, regardless of what position they had held previously.&lt;ref name="Lord46" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', 53.13.&lt;/ref&gt;

A passage in the New Testament notes that cases might be judged by a proconsul: "If therefore Demetrius and the artisans with him have a complaint against anyone, the courts are open, and there are proconsuls; let them bring charges there against one another."&lt;ref&gt;{{bible|Acts|19:38|NRSV}}, NRSV.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Notitia Dignitatum]]'', an early fifth-century imperial chancery document, mentions three proconsuls but no propraetors. These outranked even the vicars in protocol, though administratively they were subordinates like all governors. They governed the provinces of: Asia, comprising the central part of the western [[Anatolia]]n coast; [[Achaea (Roman province)|Achaea]], comprising the [[Peloponnese]] and most of [[Central Greece]]; and [[Africa Province|Africa]], the northern part of modern [[Tunisia]].&lt;ref&gt;Fairly, William, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=EjETH6V8lJYC Notitia Dignitatum, Or, Register of Dignataries]'', Department of history of the University of Pennsylvania, 1899: Achaea, p. 4; Africa, p. 36; Asia, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==British Empire==

British colonial officials sometimes referred to as proconsuls include [[Alfred Milner]] in South Africa, [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Lord Curzon]] in India, [[Frederick Lugard, 1st Baron Lugard|Lord Lugard]] in Nigeria, and [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] in Egypt and Sudan.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Knight, "Britain and Latin America" in Andrew Porter (ed), ''The Oxford history of the British Empire. Vol. 3, The nineteenth century'', 1999, Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; These leaders were able to take imperial initiatives even when the government in London was reluctant. Conservative and Unionist governments were notably more tolerant of such freelancing than Liberal governments were. These proconsuls ruled in the age of the transoceanic telegraph, so rapid communication did not end proconsular independence.&lt;ref name="Lord14" /&gt;

==United States==
Various American commanders and ambassadors have been referred to as proconsuls. Writer Carnes Lord discusses [[William Howard Taft]] in the Philippines (1900–1903); [[Leonard Wood]] in Cuba; [[Lucius D. Clay]] in Germany; [[Douglas MacArthur]] in Korea; [[Edward Lansdale]] in Vietnam; [[Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.]], ambassador to Vietnam in 1963–1964; [[Creighton Abrams]], who commanded in the Vietnam War from 1968 to 1972; [[Ellsworth Bunker|Ellsworth Butler]], ambassador in Vietnam in 1967–1973; [[William Colby]] and Ellsworth Bunker in Vietnam; [[Wesley Clark]] in Bosnia in 1994–99, Lewis Paul Bremer in Iraq in 2003; and David Petraeus in Iraq in 2004–08 and in Afghanistan in 2010–11.&lt;ref&gt;Lord, pp. vii, 21, 67, 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2728">'''Reclaim Australia: Reduce Immigration''' (RARI) was a minor [[Australia]]n political party that was active from 1996 to 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate=19 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The party advocated reducing [[Immigration to Australia]] and was associated with the [[far right]] of [[Australian politics]]. The party was deregistered due to a lack of members, and was largely displaced by the more successful [[One Nation (Australia)|One Nation]] and, to a lesser extent, [[Australians Against Further Immigration]] (AAFI). The party's best electoral result was in the [[Blaxland by-election, 1996|by-election]] following the retirement of former [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[Paul Keating]] from the federal seat of [[Division of Blaxland|Blaxland]]. In this by-election, the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] did not field a candidate to oppose the sitting [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]], and, although RARI finished behind AAFI on the primary vote, on [[Ranked voting systems|preferences]] RARI was able to come second in the seat.

The amendment is particularly notable for clarifying and supplementing the 1970 act and the [[National Park Service Organic Act]] of 1916 with the following two important sentences as the second and third to the General Authorities Act:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Congress declares that the national park system, which began with establishment of Yellowstone National Park in 1872, has since grown to include superlative natural, historic, and recreation areas in every major region of the United States, its territories and island possessions; that these areas, though distinct in character, are united through their inter-related purposes and resources into one national park system as cumulative expressions of a single national heritage; that, individually and collectively, these areas derive increased national dignity and recognition of their superlative environmental quality through their inclusion jointly with each other in one national park system preserved and managed for the benefit and inspiration of all the people of the United States; and that it is the purpose of this Act to include all such areas in the System and to clarify the authorities applicable to the system. '''Congress further reaffirms, declares, and directs that the promotion and regulation of the various areas of the National Park System, as defined in section 1c of this title, shall be consistent with and founded in the purpose established by section 1 of this title''' [the Organic Act provision quoted above], '''to the common benefit of all the people of the United States. The authorization of activities shall be construed and the protection, management, and administration of these areas shall be conducted in light of the high public value and integrity of the National Park System and shall not be exercised in derogation of the values and purposes for which these various areas have been established, except as may have been or shall be directly and specifically provided by Congress.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|16|1a-1}}, ''National Park System: administration; declaration of findings and purpose''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By this amendment the [[United States Congress]] reiterated the provisions of the Organic Act, and made equal all areas of the National Park System no matter the designation.  This provides equal protection to all areas of the National Park System from impairment and/or derogation of their resources.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8970">{{About|the human rights concept|the U.S. laws of the same name|right-to-work law}}

The '''right to work''' is the concept that people have a [[human rights|human right]] to work, or engage in productive [[employment]], and may not be prevented from doing so. The right to work is enshrined in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and recognized in [[international human rights law]] through its inclusion in the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]], where the right to work emphasizes economic, social and cultural development.

==Definition==
Article 23.1 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/UDHR/Pages/Language.aspx?LangID=eng |title=Universal Declaration of Human Rights : English |website=Ohchr.org |accessdate=2016-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote| (1) Everyone has the right to work, to free choice of employment, to just and favourable conditions of work and to protection against unemployment. | Universal Declaration of Human Rights | United Nations General Assembly}}

The [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] states in Part III, Article 6:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights| publisher = Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights| year = 1966| url = http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CESCR.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|(1) The States Parties to the present Covenant recognize the right to work, which includes the right of everyone to the opportunity to gain his living by work which he freely chooses or accepts, and will take appropriate steps to safeguard this right.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
(2) The steps to be taken by a State Party to the present Covenant to achieve the full realization of this right shall include technical and vocational guidance and training programmes, policies and techniques to achieve steady economic, social and cultural development and full and productive employment under conditions safeguarding fundamental political and economic freedoms to the individual. | International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights | United Nations General Assembly}}

The [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]] also recognises the right, emphasising conditions and pay, i.e. [[labor rights]]. Article 15, states:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.achpr.org/instruments/achpr/#a15|title=African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights|last=|first=|date=|website=www.achpr.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Every individual shall have the right to work under equitable and satisfactory conditions, and shall receive [[equal pay for equal work]]. | African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights | Organisation of African Unity}}

==History==
The phrase "the right to work" was coined by the French socialist leader [[Louis Blanc]] in light of the social turmoil of the early 19th century and rising unemployment in the wake of the 1846 financial crisis which led up to the [[French Revolution of 1848]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Robertson |first=Priscilla Smith |date=1952 |title=Revolutions of 1848: A Social History |url=https://books.google.pt/books?redir_esc=y&amp;hl=pt-PT&amp;id=SX-ectAexEoC&amp;q=Louis+Blanc#v=snippet&amp;q=Right%20to%20work&amp;f=false |publisher=Princeton University Press |page=69 |isbn=9780691007564}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[right to property]] was a crucial demand in early quests for political freedom and equality, and against [[feudal]] control of property. Property can serve as the basis for the entitlements that ensure the realisation of the [[right to an adequate standard of living]] and it was only property owners which were initially granted [[civil and political rights]], such as the [[right to vote]]. Because not everybody is a property owner, the right to work was enshrined to allow everybody to attain an adequate standard of living.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Alfredsson| first = Gudmundur|author2=Eide, Asbjorn | title = The Universal Declaration of Human Rights: a common standard of achievement| publisher = Martinus Nijhoff Publishers| year = 1999| page = 533 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=FmuoB-BlMvEC&amp;dq=%22right+to+property%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-90-411-1168-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today discrimination on the basis of property ownership is recognised as a serious threat to the equal enjoyment of human rights by all and non-discrimination clauses in [[international human rights instruments]] frequently include property as a ground on the basis of which discrimination is prohibited (see the [[right to equality before the law]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Alfredsson| first = Gudmundur|author2=Eide, Asbjorn | title = The Universal Declaration of Human Rights: a common standard of achievement| publisher = Martinus Nijhoff Publishers| year = 1999| page = 372 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=FmuoB-BlMvEC&amp;dq=%22right+to+property%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-90-411-1168-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, [[right-to-work law|"right to work" laws]] as passed by states have sometimes been attempts to curtail union organizing. In other cases, they have been directed against regulation of qualifications for certain positions, including professional fields governed by professional organizations. Numerous U.S. states have passed laws requiring licensing, testing, or educational requirements, often in response to voter complaints about ill-prepared persons, such as people claiming medical expertise. The Friedmans reported in 1980 that
&lt;blockquote&gt;Today you are not free to offer your services as a lawyer, a physician, a dentist, a plumber, a barber, a mortician or engage in a host of other occupations, without first getting a permit or license from a government official.&lt;ref name="friedman" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many laws were supported by existing professionals and their organizations in an effort to ensure a level of competence. Other observers believe their efforts were directed at simply restraining competition to increase prices for fees. In response, entrepreneurs and activists have won numerous court cases securing constitutional protection for the right to earn a living.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ij.org/cases/economicliberty |title=Economic Liberty|author=The Institute for Justice|accessdate=May 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such cases have won the right to work for Louisiana monks who sell caskets, Philadelphia independent tour guides, Colorado taxi drivers, and Connecticut interior designers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.interiordesign.net/article/478746-Judge_Rules_Interior_Design_Title_Act_Unconstitutional_in_Connecticut.php |title=Judge Rules Interior Design Title Act Unconstitutional in Connecticut |author=Laurel Petriello |date=2009-07-06 |work=Interior Design magazine |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120045049/http://www.interiordesign.net/article/478746-Judge_Rules_Interior_Design_Title_Act_Unconstitutional_in_Connecticut.php |archivedate=2011-11-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Paul Lafargue]], in ''[[The Right to Be Lazy|The Right to be Lazy]]'' (1883), wrote: "And to think that the sons of the heroes of [[Reign of Terror|the Terror]] have allowed themselves to be degraded by the religion of work, to the point of accepting, since 1848, as a revolutionary conquest, the law limiting factory labor to twelve hours. They proclaim as a revolutionary principle the Right to Work. Shame to the French proletariat! Only slaves would have been capable of such baseness."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Lafargue ''[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Paul_Lafargue__The_Right_To_Be_Lazy.html#toc3 The Right To Be Lazy]'', Chapter II, 2nd paragraph&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980 book ''[[Free to Choose]]'', economists [[Milton Friedman|Milton]] and [[Rose Friedman]] said, "[An] essential part of economic freedom is freedom to use the resources we possess in accordance with our own values – freedom to enter any occupation, engage in any business enterprise, buy from and sell to anyone else, so long as we do so on a strictly voluntary basis and do not resort to force in order to coerce others."&lt;ref name="friedman"&gt;{{cite book|author=Milton Friedman and Rose Friedman |title=Free to Choose | year=1980 | isbn=978-0-15-633460-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ron Keeva Unz''' (born September 20, 1961) is a former [[businessman]], best known for an unsuccessful race in the [[California gubernatorial election, 1994]], and for sponsoring propositions promoting structured [[English language|English]] immersion education. He was [[publisher]] of ''[[The American Conservative]]'' from March 2007 to August 2013. He now publishes ''The Unz Review: An Alternative Media Selection: A Collection of Interesting, Important, and Controversial Perspectives Largely Excluded from the American Mainstream Media''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unz.com/|title=''The Unz Review''|publisher=unz.com|accessdate=May 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Early life and career==
Of Jewish descent and raised in a [[Yiddish]] speaking household,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hornblower |first1=Margot |title=The Man Behind Prop. 227 |url=http://edition.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/06/01/time/prop.277.html |accessdate=9 June 2018 |work=CNN |date=1998-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unz attended [[North Hollywood High School]] and, in his senior year, won first place in the 1979 [[Westinghouse Science Talent Search]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.laweekly.com/news/being-ron-unz-2131367|first=Douglas|title=Being Ron Unz|last=Foster|work=[[LA Weekly]]|date=November 24, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He attended [[Harvard University]], earning a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[physics]] and ancient history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.onenation.org/0698/061498.html|first=Frank|title=The California Entrepreneur who Beat Bilingual Teaching|last=Bruni|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 14, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then went to the [[University of Cambridge]] and eventually to [[Stanford University]] to begin doctoral work in theoretical physics, which he never completed. He was later awarded a master's degree by Stanford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ronunz.org/summary-biography|title=Summary Biography of Ron Unz|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onenation.org/unz.html|title=English for the Children|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unz worked in the [[banking]] industry writing software for mortgage securities during his studies, and founded a company called [[Wall Street Analytics]] in [[Palo Alto, California]].  In 2006 his company was acquired by the ratings firm [[Moody's]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsainc.com/news/wsa/?news_id=16|title=Moody’s Corporation Acquires Wall Street Analytics|date=December 18, 2006|work=MWSA News|publisher=Moody’s Corporation|accessdate=14 September 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071028152111/http://www.wsainc.com/news/wsa/?news_id=16|archivedate=2007-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
Unz made an unsuccessful bid for the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nomination in the [[California gubernatorial election, 1994]].  He received 707,431 votes (34.3 percent) in the primary race against the [[incumbent]] [[Pete Wilson]], who won the primary with 1,266,832 votes (61.4 percent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vote96.sos.ca.gov/Vote96/html/stats/SOVp94.htm|title=1994 Statement of Vote|publisher=[[California Secretary of State]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222153313/http://vote96.sos.ca.gov/Vote96/html/stats/SOVp94.htm|archivedate=2008-12-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newspapers referred to Unz's candidacy as a ''Revenge of the Nerds'' and often quoted his claim of a 214 IQ.&lt;ref&gt;Phil Reeves, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/nerds-seek-revenge-in-californian-poll-apathy-marks-the-run-up-to-the-contest-for-governor-writes-phil-reeves-in-los-angeles-1436526.html "'Nerds' seek revenge in Californian poll: Apathy marks the run up to the contest for governor"], ''The Independent'' (Los Angeles), May 17, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amy Wallace, [http://articles.latimes.com/1994-05-08/news/mn-55185_1 Unlikely Path Led to Wilson Foe's Far-Right Challenge - Politics: A computer 'genius' with a passion for Greek philosophy, Ron Unz has set out to jolt the GOP]. May 8, 1994 ''Los Angeles Times''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Margot Hornblower, [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,988457,00.html "The Man Behind Prop. 227"], By Frank Bruni, [http://www.time.com Time.com], June 8, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/14/us/the-california-entrepreneur-who-beat-bilingual-teaching.html?partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all The California Entrepreneur who Beat Bilingual Teaching], ''New York Times''  June 14, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, he was opposed to [[California Proposition 187]], a 1994 ballot initiative to establish a state-run citizenship screening system and prohibit [[alien (law)|undocumented immigrants]] from using non-emergency health care, public education, and other services in the State of [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|

In 1998, Unz sponsored [[California Proposition 227 (1998)|California Proposition 227]], which aimed to change the state's [[bilingual education]] to an opt-in structured English language educational system and which was approved by the voters&lt;ref&gt;[http://primary98.sos.ca.gov/VoterGuide/Propositions/227yesarg.htm Arguments in favor] of 1998 [[California Proposition 227 (1998)|California Ballot Proposition 227]]&lt;/ref&gt; despite opposition from language education researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-rcf.usc.edu/~cmmr/krashen_unzFeb9.html|title=CMMR:  Notes by Steve Krashen on the Unz Attack|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proposition 227 did not seek to end bilingual education, as special exemptions were made for students to remain in an English immersion class if a parent so desires.  However, there were limits (such as age restrictions) for the exemptions, and there were provisions to discipline teachers that refused to teach solely or predominantly in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Crawford | first = James | title = At War with Diversity | publisher = Multilingual Matters | location = Clevedon | year = 2000 | isbn = 1-85359-505-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Proposition 227 was approved in June 1998; it was repealed by [[California Proposition 58 (2016)|Proposition 58]] in November 2016. In 2002, Unz backed a similar initiative, the [[Massachusetts English Language Education in Public Schools Initiative]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston-sub/doc/405491785.html |title=HEATED BATTLE OVER ENGLISH IMMERSION INTENSIFIES |newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] |page=B.6 |last=Tench |first=Megan |date=November 3, 2002 |accessdate=March 10, 2018 |url-access=limited |via=pqarchiver.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was approved by voters.

The book ''English for the Children: Mandated by the People, Skewed by Politicians and Special Interests'' by Johanna Haver (Rowman &amp; Littlefield Education, 2013) recounts the controversies and political action resulting from Unz's California and subsequent ballot initiatives: Arizona Proposition 203, Colorado Amendment 31, and Massachusetts Question 2.

In 2012 and 2014, Unz worked on a ballot initiative to raise the Californian minimum wage from $10 to $12, but his campaign failed.&lt;ref name="nf1"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Patterson |first1=Robert |title=The Missing Plank of the GOP Platform: |url=http://familyinamerica.org/journals/fall-2012/missing-plank-gop-platform/ |accessdate=16 June 2018 |publisher=The Natural Family}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Abramsky|first1=Sasha|title=What If the Minimum Wage Were $15 an Hour?|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/what-if-minimum-wage-were-15-hour/|accessdate=29 May 2018|publisher=The Nation|date=8 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His proposal was supported by [[James K. Galbraith]].&lt;ref name="nf1"/&gt;

In 2016, Unz started "[[Free Harvard, Fair Harvard]]" campaign, centered on the [[Harvard Board of Overseers]]. Its slate of candidates was Unz, [[Lee Cheng]], [[Stuart Taylor, Jr.]], [[Stephen Hsu]], and [[Ralph Nader]]. The campaign sought for [[tuition fees]] at Harvard to be abolished and for greater transparency in the admissions process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Saul |first=Stephanie |date=14 January 2016 |title=How Some Would Level the Playing Field: Free Harvard Degrees |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/15/us/a-push-to-make-harvard-free-also-questions-the-role-of-race-in-admissions.html |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |location= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Adamczyk |first=Alicia |date=15 January 2016 |title=Group Says Harvard Tuition Should Be Free for All Students |url=http://time.com/money/4182336/harvard-free-tuition-endowment/ |newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |location= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unz also started a 2016 campaign for U.S. Senate in California, primarily to bring attention to the effort to repeal Proposition 227.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Blood |first=Michael |date=16 March 2016 |title=Republican Ron Unz joins race for Boxer’s US Senate seat  |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/16/republican-ron-unz-joins-race-for-boxers-us-senate/ |newspaper=[[Washington Times]] |location= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McGreevy |first=Patrick |date=30 April 2014 |title=Calif.

==''The Unz Review'' and other activities==
In November 2013, Unz launched the website, ''The Unz Review'', a blogging platform which "bills itself as an 'alternative' to the 'mainstream media'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/policy/international/middle-east-north-africa/351745-valerie-plame-tweets-story-blaming-americas|newspaper=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]|accessdate=November 7, 2017|date=September 21, 2017|title=Valerie Plame tweets story blaming 'America's Jews' for foreign wars|first=Mallory|last=Shelbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contributors include some left-wing writers, such as [[Patrick Cockburn]], [[Norman Finkelstein]] and [[James Petras]], but are mostly on the far right, including [[Pat Buchanan]], [[Paul Gottfried]], [[Steve Sailer]] and [[John Derbyshire]]. 

According to the [[Anti-Defamation League]], the webzine is an "outlet for certain writers to attack Israel and Jews". More generally, according the ADL, while Unz "does not appear to be an anti-Semite, he provides support to extreme anti-Israel ideologues".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.adl.org/news/article/ron-unz-controversial-writer-and-funder-of-anti-israel-activists|accessdate=June 13, 2018|date=January 20, 2014|title=Ron Unz: Controversial Writer and Funder of Anti-israel Activists|publisher=[[Anti-Defamation League]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been described as "an alternative conservative website",&lt;ref name="Tatum 2017 Valerie Plame"/&gt; "far right",&lt;ref name="SBS News 2018"&gt;{{cite news| title=Why white supremacists are chugging milk | website=SBS News | date=18 October 2018 | url=https://www.sbs.com.au/news/why-white-supremacists-are-chugging-milk | access-date=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[alt-right]]" and "a mix of far-right and far-left anti-Semitic crackpottery.,&lt;ref name="Young 2016"&gt;{{cite web | last=Young | first=Cathy | title=You Can’t Whitewash The Alt-Right’s Bigotry | website=The Federalist | date=14 April 2016 | url=http://thefederalist.com/2016/04/14/you-cant-whitewash-the-alt-rights-bigotry/ | access-date=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unz has donated tens of thousands of dollars to the far-right website [[VDARE]], claiming that he supports them because they are "mostly broke and they write interesting things."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Duehren |first1=Andrew M |last2=Thompson |first2=Daphne C |title=Overseers Candidate Donates to ‘Quasi-White Nationalist’ Group |url=https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/4/14/ron-unz-donations/ |accessdate=5 June 2018 |work=The Harvard Crimson |date=2016-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Krantz 2016"&gt;{{cite news| last=Krantz | first=Laura | title=Leader of bid to shake up Harvard board linked to white-supremacist writers | website=BostonGlobe.com | date=16 April 2016 | url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2016/04/16/leader-bid-shake-harvard-board-linked-white-supremacist-writers/3YGidncAQoAINn64eXbevI/story.html | access-date=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, he was a keynote speaker at VDARE's first national conference.&lt;ref name="Southern Poverty Law Center 2017"&gt;{{cite web | title=White Nationalists To Gather This March for VDARE’s First National Conference | website=Southern Poverty Law Center | date=23 January 2017 | url=https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2017/01/23/white-nationalists-gather-march-vdare%E2%80%99s-first-national-conference | access-date=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, ''The Unz Review'' received public attention when former [[CIA]] operative [[Valerie Plame Wilson]] was criticised after tweeting an antisemitic article titled "America's Jews Are Driving America's Wars" published in the webzine.&lt;ref name="Tatum 2017 Valerie Plame"&gt;{{cite news| last=Tatum | first=Sophie | title=Ex-CIA operative apologizes for tweet | website=CNN | date=22 September 2017 | url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/09/21/politics/valerie-plame-wilson-tweet/index.html | access-date=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018, Unz used ''The Unz Review'' to promote the [[blood libel]] against Jews and endorsed the conspiracy tract [[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]].&lt;ref name="Anti-Defamation League 2018 series of antisemitic attacks"&gt;{{cite web | title=California Entrepreneur Ron Unz Launches a Series of Rhetorical Attacks on Jews - Anti-Defamation League | website=Anti-Defamation League | date=4 October 2018 | url=https://www.adl.org/blog/california-entrepreneur-ron-unz-launches-a-series-of-rhetorical-attacks-on-jews | access-date=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2018, Unz [[Holocaust denial|denied]] the reality of the Holocaust, writing "I think it far more likely than not that the standard Holocaust narrative is at least substantially false, and quite possibly, almost entirely so."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unz.com/runz/american-pravda-holocaust-denial/ |last=Unz |first=Rob |website=The Unz Review |access-date=November 1, 2018 |title="American Pravda: Holocaust Denial" |archive-url=http://archive.is/11O73 |archive-date=August 31, 2018 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Anti-Defamation League 2018 series of antisemitic attacks"/&gt;

The '''Shanghai massacre''' of April 12, 1927, known commonly in China as the '''April 12 Incident''', was the violent suppression of [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) organizations in [[Shanghai]] by the military forces of [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and conservative factions in the [[Kuomintang]] (Nationalist Party, or KMT). Following the incident, conservative KMT elements carried out a full-scale purge of Communists in all areas under their control, and even more violent suppression occurred in [[Guangzhou]] and [[Changsha]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilbur, Nationalist Revolution 114&lt;/ref&gt; The purge led to an open split between left and right wing factions in the KMT, with Chiang Kai-shek establishing himself as the leader of the right wing faction based in [[Nanjing]], in opposition to the original left-wing KMT government based in [[Wuhan]] led by [[Wang Jingwei]].

By 15 July 1927, the Wuhan regime had also expelled the Communists in its ranks, effectively ending the KMT's four-year alliance with the [[Comintern]] and the Chinese Communist Party. For the remainder of 1927, the CPC launched several uprisings in an attempt to regain their previous power, marking the beginning of the [[Chinese Civil War]]. With the failure of the [[Guangzhou Uprising]] however, the Communist Party was largely diminished in their influence, unable to launch another major urban offensive.&lt;ref&gt;Wilbur, Nationalist Revolution 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Names ==
In KMT historiography, the event is occasionally referred to as "April 12 Purge" (四一二清黨), while the Communist historiography refers to the event in the form of "April 12 Counter-revolutionary Coup" (四一二反革命政變) or "April 12 Tragedy" (四一二慘案).&lt;ref&gt;Zhao, Suisheng. [2004] (2004). A Nation-State by Construction: Dynamics of Modern Chinese Nationalism. Stanford University Press. {{ISBN|0-8047-5001-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The roots of the April 12 Incident go back to the Kuomintang's alliance with the [[Soviet Union]], formally initiated by KMT founder [[Sun Yat-sen]] after discussions with Soviet diplomat [[Adolph Joffe]] in January 1923. This alliance included both financial and military aid and a small but important group of Soviet political and military advisors, headed by [[Mikhail Borodin]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilbur 1976, 135–140.&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Union's conditions for alliance and aid included cooperation with the small [[Communist Party of China]]. Sun agreed to let the Communists join the KMT as individuals, but ruled out an alliance with them or their participation as an organized bloc; in addition, once in the KMT he demanded that the Communists support KMT's party ideology and observe party discipline. Following their admission, Communist activities within the KMT, often covert, soon attracted opposition to this policy among prominent KMT members.&lt;ref&gt;Wilbur 1976, 180-81.&lt;/ref&gt; Internal conflicts between left- and right-wing leaders of the KMT with regards to the CPC problem continued right up to the launch of the [[Northern Expedition]].

Plans for a Northern Expedition originated with Sun Yat-sen. After his expulsion from the government in [[Peking]], by 1920 he had made a military comeback, gaining control of some parts of Guangdong province. His goal was to extend his control over all of China, particularly Peking. After Sun's death from cancer in March 1925, KMT leaders continued to push the plan, and--after purging Guangzhou's Communists and Soviet advisors during the "[[Canton Coup]]" on 20 May 1926--finally launched the Expedition that June. Initial successes in the first months of the Expedition soon saw the KMT's [[National Revolutionary Army]] (NRA) in control of [[Guangdong]] and large areas in [[Hunan]], [[Hubei]], [[Jiangxi]] and [[Fujian]].

With the growth of KMT authority and military strength, the struggle for control of the Party's direction and leadership intensified. In January 1927 the NRA commanded by Chiang Kai-shek captured [[Wuhan]] and went on to attack [[Nanchang]], while KMT leader [[Wang Jingwei]] and his left-wing allies, along with the Chinese Communists and Soviet agent Borodin, transferred the seat of the [[Nationalist Government]] from Guangzhou to Wuhan. On March 1 the Nationalist government reorganized the Military Commission and placed Chiang under its jurisdiction, while secretly plotting to arrest him. Chiang found out about this plot, which most likely led to his determination to purge the CPC from KMT.&lt;ref&gt;[[Zhang Guotao|Chang Kuo-t'ao]], The rise of the Chinese Communist Party: 1928–1938, p. 581&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chiang1926.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Chiang Kai-shek]] at the beginning of the Northern Expedition in 1926.]]

In response to the advances of the NRA, Communists in Shanghai began to plan uprisings against the warlord forces controlling the city. On March 21–22 KMT and CPC union workers led by [[Zhou Enlai]] and [[Chen Duxiu]] launched an armed uprising in Shanghai, defeating the warlord forces of the [[Zhili clique]]. The victorious union workers occupied and governed urban Shanghai except for the [[Shanghai International Settlement|international settlements]] prior to the arrival of the NRA's Eastern Route Army led by Gen. [[Bai Chongxi]] and Gen. [[Li Zongren]]. After the [[Nanking incident of 1927|Nanking Incident]], in which foreign concessions in Nanjing were attacked and looted, both the right wing of the Kuomintang and western powers became alarmed by the growth of Communist influence, while the CP continued to organize daily mass student protests and labor strikes, demanding the return of Shanghai international settlements to Chinese control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper |last = Elizabeth |first = J.

== The Purge ==

{{refimprove|section|date=April 2017}}

On April 5 Wang Jingwei arrived in Shanghai from overseas and met with the CPC leader Chen Duxiu. After their meeting they issued a joint declaration re-affirming the principle of cooperation between the KMT and the CPC, despite urgent pleas from Chiang and other KMT elders to eliminate Communist influence. When Wang left Shanghai for Wuhan the next day, Chiang asked [[Green Gang]] leader [[Du Yuesheng]] and other gang leaders in Shanghai to form a rival union to oppose the Shanghai labor union controlled by the Communists, and made final preparations for purging CPC members.

On April 9 Chiang declared [[martial law]] in Shanghai and the Central Control Commission issued the "Party Protection and National Salvation" proclamation, denouncing the Wuhan Nationalist Government's policy of cooperation with the CPC. On April 11 Chiang issued a secret order to all provinces under the control of his forces to purge Communists from the KMT.

Before dawn on April 12, gang members began to attack district offices controlled by the union workers, including [[Zhabei]], [[Nanshi District, Shanghai|Nanshi]] and [[Pudong]]. Under an emergency decree, Chiang ordered the 26th Army to disarm the workers' militias; that resulted in more than 300 people being killed and wounded. The union workers organized a [[mass meeting]] denouncing Chiang Kai-shek on April 13, and thousands of workers and students went to the headquarters of the 2nd Division of the 26th Army to protest. Soldiers opened fire, killing 100 and wounding many more. Chiang dissolved the provisional government of Shanghai, labor unions and all other organizations under Communist control, and reorganized a network of unions with allegiance to the Kuomintang and under the control of Du Yuesheng. Some sources say that over 1000 Communists were arrested, some 300 were executed and more than 5,000 went missing; others claim 5,000-10,000 killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ryan |first1=Tom |editor1-last=Purnell |editor1-first=Ingrid |editor2-last=Plozza |editor2-first=Shivaun |date=2016 |title=China Rising: The Revolutionary Experience |location=Collingwood |publisher=History Teachers' Association of Victoria |page=77 |ISBN = 9781875585083 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Western news reports later nicknamed Gen.

== Aftermath and significance ==
For the Kuomintang, 39 members of the Kuomintang Central Committee in Wuhan publicly denounced [[Chiang Kai-shek]] as a traitor to [[Sun Yat-sen]], including Sun's widow [[Soong Ching-ling]] immediately after the purge. However, Chiang was defiant, forming a new Nationalist Government at Nanjing to rival the Communist-tolerant Nationalist Government in Wuhan controlled by Wang Jingwei on April 18. The purges garnered the Nanjing government the support of much of the NRA, the Chinese merchant class, and foreign businesses, bolstering its economic and military position.{{sfn|Jowett|2013|pp=158–159}}

The twin rival KMT governments, known as the Ninghan (Nanjing and Wuhan) Split (Chinese: 宁汉分裂), did not last long. In May 1927 Communists and peasant leaders in the Wuhan area were repeatedly attacked by Nationalist generals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

More than 10,000 communists in [[Guangzhou|Canton]], [[Xiamen]], [[Fuzhou]], [[Ningbo]], [[Nanjing]], [[Hangzhou]] and [[Changsha]] were arrested and executed within 20 days. The Soviet Union officially terminated its cooperation with the KMT while Wang, fearing retribution as a Communist sympathizer, fled to Europe. The Wuhan Nationalist government soon disintegrated, leaving Chiang as the sole legitimate leader of the Kuomintang. In the year after April 1927, over 300,000 people were killed across China in anti-Communist suppression campaigns carried out by the KMT.&lt;ref name="Barnouin38"&gt;Barnouin, Barbara and Yu Changgen.

On the Communists' side, Chen Duxiu and his Soviet advisers, who had promoted cooperation with the KMT, were discredited and lost their leadership roles in the CPC. Chen was personally blamed, forced to resign and replaced by [[Qu Qiubai]], who did not change Chen's policies in any fundamental way. The CPC planned for worker uprisings and revolutions in the urban areas.&lt;ref name="Barnouin38" /&gt;

The first battles of the ten-year Chinese Civil War began with armed Communist insurrections in Changsha, [[Shantou]], Nanchang and Guangzhou. During the [[Nanchang Uprising]] in August Communist troops under [[Zhu De]] were defeated but escaped from Kuomintang forces by withdrawing to the mountains of western [[Jiangxi]]. In September [[Mao Zedong]] led a small peasant army in what has come to be called the [[Autumn Harvest Uprising]] in Hunan province. It was defeated by Kuomintang forces and the survivors retreated to Jiangxi as well, forming the first elements of what would become the [[People's Liberation Army]]. By the time the CPC Central Committee was forced to flee Shanghai in 1933, Mao had established peasant-based [[Soviet (council)|soviet]]s in Jiangxi and Hunan provinces, transforming the Communist Party's base of support from the urban [[proletariat]] to the countryside, where the [[People's War]] would be fought.

In June 1928 the National Revolutionary Army captured the [[Beiyang]] [[Beiyang government|Government's]] capital of [[Beijing]], leading to the [[Chinese reunification (1928)|nominal unification of China]] and worldwide recognition of the Kuomintang led by Chiang Kai-shek as the legal government of the Republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper | author = Patricia Stranahan | title = The Shanghai Labor Movement, 1927–1931 | publisher = East Asian Working Paper Series on Language and Politics in Modern China | year = 1994 | url = http://www.indiana.edu/~easc/resources/working_paper/noframe_4b_polit.htm | accessdate = November 25, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061024165448/http://www.indiana.edu/~easc/resources/working_paper/noframe_4b_polit.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = October 24, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Spiked''''' (also written as '''''sp!ked''''') is a British [[online magazine|Internet magazine]] focusing on politics, culture and society.

== Editors and contributors ==

''Spiked'' is edited by [[Brendan O'Neill (journalist)|Brendan O'Neill]],&lt;ref name = FAQ&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php?/about/article/193/ | title = Frequently asked questions | work = Spiked | accessdate =14 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; following [[Mick Hume]]'s departure in January 2007, and features regular contributions from [[James Heartfield]], [[Michael Fitzpatrick (physician)|Michael Fitzpatrick]], [[Patrick West]], Rob Lyons, Nathalie Rothschild, Tim Black, Duleep Allirajah, Tom Slater, Joanna Williams and [[Frank Furedi]].

== Origin ==
The magazine was founded in 2000 after the [[bankruptcy]] of its predecessor, ''[[Living Marxism]]'' (''LM'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2016/05/31/spik-m31.html|title=The politics and origins of Britain’s Spiked-Online—Part Two|last=Reed|first=Zach|access-date=2018-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lrb.co.uk/v32/n13/jenny-turner/who-are-they|title=Who Are They?|last=Ideas|first=Jenny Turner reports from the Battle of|date=2010-07-08|work=London Review of Books|access-date=2018-05-24|pages=3–8|issn=0260-9592}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/8323#.WwaXoUiUvZs|title=Why we were right to fight|website=www.spiked-online.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''LM'' closed after losing a [[English defamation law|libel]] case brought against it by the broadcasting corporation [[ITN]]. The case centred around ITN coverage of [[Fikret Alić]] and other Bosnian Muslims standing behind a barbed-wire fence at the [[Trnopolje camp]] during the [[Yugoslav war]]. ''LM'' opposed Western intervention on traditional anti-imperialist grounds, and thus warned against the tendency to moralise the conflict – with Muslims portrayed as the victims and [[Serbs]] as the villains – which was fuelling the clamour for military action. ''LM'' published an article titled "The Picture that Fooled the World"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

During the court case, evidence given by the camp doctor led LM to abandon its defence. ITN was awarded damages and costs, estimated to be around £1 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/article419696.ece|title = The day I faced being a £1m bankrupt|date = 7 March 2005|first = Mick|last = Hume|work = The Times|accessdate = 14 April 2007|location = London|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110523235709/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/article419696.ece|archive-date = 23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stance ==
''Spiked'' focuses on issues of freedom and state control, science and technology, culture, education and literature.

The magazine opposes all forms of censorship, by the state or otherwise. Its writers call for a repeal of [[libel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php?/site/article/935/ | title = Don’t tinker with the libel laws – scrap them | first = Helene | last = Guldberg | date = 6 July 2006 | work = Spiked | accessdate =14 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[hate speech]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php?/site/article/34/ | title = Sticks, stones and hate speech | work = Spiked | first = Josie | last = Appleton | date = 11 April 2006 | accessdate =14 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[incitement]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Free speech, with the edges taken off | url = http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php?/site/article/273/ | first = Brendan | last = O’Neill | date = 28 March 2006 | work = Spiked |accessdate =14 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Can music incite murder? | url = http://www.spiked-online.com/Articles/0000000CA733.htm | first = Brendan | last = O’Neill | date = 13 October 2004 | accessdate =14 April 2007 | work = Spiked }}&lt;/ref&gt; laws, and of censorship on university campuses (e.g. [[No Platform]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiked-online.com/down-with-campus-censorship-campaign Down with campus censorship! Campaign]. ''Sp!ked'' official website. Retrieved 24 May 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; They have criticised laws targeted at paedophiles as counterproductive to rehabilitation and conducive to mob violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The return of the paedophile panic | url = http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php?/site/article/4557/ | first = Tim | last = Black | date = 19 February 2008 | accessdate =23 August 2017 | work = Spiked }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Spiked'' also regularly critiques [[risk society]], [[political correctness]], and environmentalism. As regards the latter, a particular ''Spiked'' target has been what they see as "exaggerated" and "hysterical" interpretations of the scientific consensus on [[global warming]], and what they argue are double-standards advocated by more advanced Western nations for self-serving reasons.&lt;ref name="Woudhuysen and Kaplinsky"&gt;{{cite web |last = Woudhuysen and Kaplinsky | title = After the IPCC: A man-made morality tale | url = http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php?/site/article/2819/ | work = Spiked |accessdate =15 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Spiked'' opposed the post-[[September 11, 2001 attacks|9/11]] invasions [[United States invasion of Afghanistan|of Afghanistan]] and [[2003 invasion of Iraq|of Iraq]] and Western interference in [[developing nations]] in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Nadine Strossen |author2=Faisal Devji |author3=Jeffrey Rosen |author4=Brendan O'Neill |author5=Michael Baum | title = Life, liberty and politics after 9/11 | url = http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php?/site/article/1602/ | work = Spiked |accessdate =15 July 2006 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Hume |first=Mick | title = The age of PR imperialism | url = http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php?/site/article/2120/ | work = Spiked |accessdate =15 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Cunliffe |first=Philip | title = Exposing ‘Empire in denial’ | url = http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php?/site/article/1601/ | work = Spiked |accessdate =15 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It seeks to counter what it sees as a recent trend in Western foreign policy: [[humanitarian intervention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = O'Neill and Brendan | title = What's worse than a Blairite? A Blair-basher | url = http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php?/site/article/3331/ | work = Spiked |accessdate =10 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have said that ''Spiked'''s stance has more in common with libertarianism than with the mainstream left.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in a [[LobbyWatch]] interview, George Monbiot claimed of ''Spiked's'' predecessor, ''[[LM Magazine]]'', that: "...it was very far from a Marxism journal – it was just about as far from a Marxist journal as you could possibly get."{{cite news | url = http://www.lobbywatch.org/archive2.asp?arcid=7748 | title = Interview with George Monbiot | first = George | last = Monbiot | publisher = [[LobbyWatch]] | accessdate =14 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frank Furedi, interviewed in ''Spiked'', responded that the stance of ''LM'' and ''Spiked'' springs from the tradition of the "[[anti-Stalinist left]]". He argued that the reason why many in the left tradition have difficulties in identifying these ideas with the left is that they completely misunderstand the humanist political position of being progressive in terms of human progress, science, rationality and freedom, and yet be completely anti-state:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...much of the left in the twentieth century tended to be influenced by Stalinist and Social-Democratic traditions, which means they could not imagine that you could be left-wing and anti-state...so they were confused by us. But that was their fault, not ours. It was a product of their own abandonment of liberty in favour of ideas about state control.&lt;ref name="O'Neill"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php?/site/article/3132/ | title = 'Humanising politics – that is my only agenda' | first = Brendan | last = O'Neill | publisher = Spiked | accessdate = 27 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Students for Trump''' ('''S4T''') is an American [[Political organization|non-profit political organization]] whose stated mission is to "see that [[Donald Trump]] is elected as the next President of the United States and that the Republican Party is placed back into power in Washington." The group was founded in 2015 by Ryan Fournier and John Lambert, students at [[Campbell University]] in [[North Carolina]], [[United States]].&lt;ref name="IBT"&gt;{{cite news |first=Julia |last=Glum |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/students-trump-meet-millennials-helping-donald-nab-youth-vote-2206369 |title=Students For Trump: Meet The Millennials Helping The Donald Nab The Youth Vote |work=[[International Business Times]] |date=December 1, 2015 |access-date=June 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization recruits Campus Ambassadors at college and high school campuses across the country, and encourages chapters to participate in on-campus advocacy, host events, and persuade students to vote for [[Donald Trump]]. Currently, the organization reports that it has over 5,000 volunteers, 280 chapters, and over 13,000 vote pledges.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

== History ==
The organization was founded in 2015 by Fournier and Lambert, students at [[Campbell University]] in [[North Carolina]], [[United States]].&lt;ref name="IBT" /&gt;

In 2016, the organization switched from a traditional campaign model with Regional, State, and Chapter coordinators, to a model with Campus Ambassadors that perform roles similar to that of a campaign field [[intern]].

== Organizational structure ==
The following people comprise the organization's national leadership team:
* Ryan Fournier (National Chairman)
* Sarah Hagmayer (Public Relations Coordinator)&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/07/18/meet-the-9-people-helping-donald-trump-win-the-internet/|title=A revealing look into Donald Trump's unofficial Internet campaign|last=Dewey|first=Caitlin|date=July 18, 2016|last2=Ohlheiser|first2=Abby|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|access-date=July 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition to the national team, the group has Campus Ambassadors on 280 college campuses across the country as of July 20, 2016.

== Projects ==

=== [[Chalkening|The Chalkening]] ===
In March and April 2016, college students at universities across the United States used chalk to write slogans in support of [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Donald Trump's presidential campaign]]. The event was publicized on [[Twitter]] by Dan Scavino and the Students for Trump official account.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.alternet.org/tea-party-and-right/trumps-call-college-supporters-express-themselves-chalk-leaves-campuses-full|title=Trump's Call for College Supporters to Express Themselves With Chalk Leaves Campuses Full of Racist Messages|last=Tesfaye|first=Sophia|date=April 11, 2016|newspaper=[[AlterNet]]|access-date=July 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The event, and ensuing student reaction, led to [[DePaul University]] to ban the use of chalk on campus property.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/apr/15/depaul-bans-chalking-after-pro-trump-messages/|title=DePaul U. bans use of chalk on sidewalks after pro-Trump messages offend|work=[[The Washington Times]]|access-date=July 21, 2016|date=April 15, 2016|first=Kelly|last=Riddell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Trump Wall" events ===
On May 9, 2016, a group of students at the [[University of Washington]] constructed an 8'x10' "Trump Wall" out of plywood and lumber in the center of the [[Red Square (University of Washington)|Red Square]] courtyard. The event, led by UW [[College Republicans]] president Jessie Gamble, UW Students for Trump president Chevy Swanson, and S4T senior advisor [[James Allsup]], lasted for an approximately an hour and a half, and was met with ten Trump supporters and over 100 protestors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.seattleweekly.com/news/the-uw-trump-movement-is-a-perfect-microcosm-of-the-donalds-ridiculous-campaign/|title=The UW Trump Movement Is a Perfect Microcosm of the Donald's Ridiculous Campaign |work=[[Seattle Weekly]]|date=May 20, 2016|language=en-US|access-date=July 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wall was painted with a brick design, with "[[Trump wall|Trump Wall]]" written in gold paint, and "[[Blue Lives Matter|Blues Lives Matter]]" and "[[Make America Great Again]]" written in blue. At one point, a student attempted to scale the wall. Shortly after this, the organizers were asked by the University Police to take the wall down, which they did.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/education/students-erect-trump-wall-at-the-university-of-washington/|title=College students erect 'Trump wall' at University of Washington|date=May 9, 2016|access-date=July 21, 2016|work=[[The Seattle Times]]|first=Katherine|last=Long}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Portland State University]] Students for Trump, a group unaffiliated with the S4T national organization, hosted a similar event on June 10, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://katu.com/news/local/psu-students-for-donald-trump-group-builds-wall-at-rally|title=PSU 'Students for Donald Trump' group builds wall at rally|work=[[KATU]]|language=en-US|access-date=July 21, 2016|date=June 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wall was smaller at this event, and beforehand organizers announced on [[Facebook]] that "[[Mexico]] and [[Black Lives Matter]] are going to need help paying for the wall so we'll be holding a collection."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/meet-the-shock-troops-of-trumps-america/|title=Meet the shock troops of Trump's America|website=[[The Raw Story]]|access-date=July 21, 2016|date=June 17, 2016|first=Arun|last=Gupta}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==

In April 2016, a Students for Trump [[Florida]] chapter placed a "Make America Great Again" ball cap on a statue of [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] just days after the anniversary of his death. This caused a wide array of social media attacks towards the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/photo-shows-martin-luther-king-statue-donald-trump-hat-article-1.2596077|title='Students for Trump' group posts photo of Martin Luther King statue wearing 'Make America Great Again' hat on University of South Florida campus |work=[[New York Daily News]]|date=April 11, 2016|language=en-US|access-date=July 21, 2016|first=Jason|last=Silverstein}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Terror-Free Oil Initiative''' was a group based in [[Coral Springs, Florida]], dedicated to encouraging Americans to buy only [[gasoline]] that originated in countries that do not export or finance [[terrorism]]&lt;ref name="soleil"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Le Soleil|date=2007-01-23|title=Du pétrole sans terreur dans le Nebraska}}&lt;/ref&gt; or are otherwise unfriendly towards the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.terrorfreeoil.com/about.php | title = About TFO }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It promoted those companies that acquire their [[Petroleum|crude oil]] supply from the nations outside [[Middle East]] and criticized those companies that do not.&lt;ref name="newsnet"&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.newsnet5.com/money/10815377/detail.html |
title = Gas Station To Offer 'Terror-Free' Oil|publisher=newsnet5.com|date=2007-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

TFOI attempted to create a healthy debate concerning alternate methods of fuel production and consumption.&lt;ref name="newsnet" /&gt;

Terror-Free Oil opened the first "terror free" gas station in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], in January 2007. In February 2010 the station closed.&lt;ref name="soleil" /&gt;&lt;ref name="newsnet" /&gt;

TFO spokesman Joe Kaufman is also the founder of a group called Americans Against Hate, a conservative civil rights organization and terrorism watchdog group.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Kaufman is a prominent critic of the [[Islamic]] advocacy organization [[Council on American-Islamic Relations]].

== Criticism ==

Terror-Free Oil purchased its gas from [[Sinclair Oil Corporation]], who buy oil from all areas of the world on the [[New York Mercantile Exchange]]. After critics questioned the buying methods of the group, founder Joe Kaufman, was forced to acknowledge that the stations were likely selling some oil from the Middle East.&lt;ref name="APM"/&gt;

Journalist and writer on energy, [[Robert Bryce (writer)|Robert Bryce]] also criticised the group on the [[American Public Media]] show [[Marketplace (radio program)|Marketplace]]&lt;ref name="APM"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://marketplace.publicradio.org/shows/2007/02/12/PM200702124.html|title=Pumping a message to fuel sales|date=2007-02-12|publisher=[[American Public Media]]|accessdate=2009-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[CNBC]] show, ''Closing Bell with Maria Bartiromo''.&lt;ref name="CNBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/15840232?video=221073758&amp;play=1|title=Terror-Free Oil|date=2007-03-20|publisher=CNBC|accessdate=2009-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bryce stated that "the trends of energy interdependence are growing and are inexorable" and branded that idea of being able choose where your oil came from as "hogwash".

'''''The Camp of the Saints''''' ({{lang-fr|Le Camp des Saints}}) is a 1973 French novel by author and explorer [[Jean Raspail]]. The novel depicts the destruction of [[Western civilization]] through [[Third World]] mass immigration to [[France]] and the [[Western world|West]]. Almost forty years after its initial publication, the novel returned to the bestseller list in 2011.&lt;ref name="L'Express"&gt;''[[L'Express]]'': [http://www.lexpress.fr/culture/livre/le-camp-des-saints-de-jean-raspail-un-succes-de-librairie-raciste_980039.html "Le camp des Saints, de Jean Raspail, un succès de librairie raciste?"], 6 April 2011, retrieved 30 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; On its publication, the book received praise from some French literary figures&lt;ref&gt;"''Le camp des saints'' finit par obtenir une critique imposante, non pas tant par le volume (demeuré incomparable à celui que provoque le moindre texte d'une vedette de variétés) que par la qualité de ses laudateurs.

In the U.S., it was praised by William F. Buckley and [[Max_Lerner|Max Lerner]], and criticized by [[Linda_Chavez|Linda Chavez]] and the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]].

== Inspiration ==
Raspail has said his inspiration came while at the French Riviera in 1971, as he was looking out at the Mediterranean.

{{Quote|What if ''they'' were to come? I did not know who "they" were, but it seemed inevitable to me that the numberless disinherited people of the South would, like a tidal wave, set sail one day for this opulent shore, our fortunate country’s wide-gaping frontier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Le Camp des Saints (Édition 2011)|last=Raspail|first=John|publisher=|year=|isbn=978-1881780076|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The name of the book comes from a passage in the [[Book of Revelation]] (Revelation 20:7–9) depicting the [[apocalypse]]. Satan influences most of the nations of the Earth to gather for one final battle against "the camp of the saints," before being defeated for eternity:

{{Quote|And when the thousand years are ended, Satan will be released from his prison and will come out to deceive the nations that are at the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them for battle; their number is like the sand of the sea. And they marched up over the broad plain of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city, but fire came down from heaven and consumed them...&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bible.com/bible/59/REV.20.esv|title=Revelation 20, English Standard Version (ESV) {{!}} Chapter 20 {{!}} The Bible App {{!}} Bible.com|website=www.bible.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Plot ==
{{Long plot|section|date=February 2018}}

In [[Kolkata|Calcutta, India]], [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] priests promote the adoption of Indian children by those back in [[Belgium]] as a form of charity. When the Belgian government realizes that the number of Indian children raised in Belgium has reached 40,000 in just five years, an emergency policy attempts to halt the migration. Desperate for the chance to send their children to what they call a "land of plenty", a mob of desperate Indians swarms the [[consulate]]. As a Belgian aid worker works through the crowd, an Indian [[gong farmer]] begs him to take them back to Europe, to which the worker agrees.

The worker and farmer bring the crowd to the docks, where there are hundreds of ships once owned by European powers, now suited only for river traffic. Nevertheless, the crowd boards, and a hundred ships soon leave for Europe; conditions on board are cramped, unsanitary and miserable, with some passengers publicly fornicating. As the ships pass "the straits of [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]]", helicopters swarm overhead, capturing images of the refugees on board to be published in Europe. Meanwhile, on the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian]] Far East, the Soviet troops see masses of Chinese ready to enter [[Siberia]] but are reluctant to fight them.

As the fleet crosses the Indian Ocean, the political situation in France becomes more charged. At a press conference about the crisis, a French official who offers a speech in praise of the refugees is confronted by a journalist who claims he is merely trying to "feed the invaders" and demands to know if France will "have the courage to stand up to" the migrants when they reach France. The official decries this question as morally offensive and threatens to throw the journalist out when he continues to yell. Other journalists seek to inflame tensions between the French and Africans and Arabs already living in the country. Over time, these journalists begin to write that the migrant fleet is on a mission to "enrich, cleanse and redeem the Capitalist West". At the same time as the fleet is praised by those in Paris, the people of [[Southern France]], terrified of the migrants' arrival, flee to the north.

As the fleet approaches the [[Suez Canal]], [[Egypt|Egyptian]] forces fire a warning shot, causing the fleet to steer south, around the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. To the surprise of observers, the [[apartheid]] regime of [[South Africa]] floats out barges of food and supplies, which the migrants throw overboard. The international press is thrilled, believing the rejection of these supplies to be a political statement against the apartheid South African regime. Western leaders, confident the refugees will accept supplies from their "more virtuous" nations, organize a supply mission, funded by governments, charities, rock stars and major churches, to meet the refugees off [[São Tomé and Príncipe|São Tomé]]. However, the fleet does not stop for these barges either, and when a worker from the [[Pope|Papal]] barge attempts to board one of the ships, he is strangled and thrown overboard. The press attempts to contain coverage of the disaster.

When the migrants pass through the [[Strait of Gibraltar]], the [[President of France|French president]] orders troops to the south and addresses the nation of his plan to repel the migrants. However, in the middle of the address, he breaks down, demands the troops simply follow their consciences instead. Most of the troops immediately desert their posts and join the civilians as they flee north, and the south is quickly overrun by the migrants. Some of the last troops to stand their ground take refuge in a small village, along with Calguès, an old man who has chosen to remain at his home, and Hamadura, a [[Westernization|Westernized]] Indian who is terrified of his "filthy, brutish" countrymen and prides himself on having more in common with whites than Indians. The troops in this village, total of nineteen Frenchmen and one Indian, surrounded by what they deem "occupied territory", remains the last defense of Western values and "Free France" against the immigrants.

The migrants make their way north, having no desire to assimilate to French culture, but continuing to demand a First World standard of living, even as they flout laws, do not produce, and murder French citizens, such as factory bosses and shopkeepers, as well as the ordinary people who do not welcome them. They are also joined by the immigrants who already reside in Europe, as well as various left-wing and anarchist groups. Across the West, more and more migrants arrive and have children, rapidly growing to outnumber whites. In a matter of months, the white West has been overrun and the pro-immigrant governments are established, while the white people are ordered to share their houses and flats with the immigrants. The village containing the troops is bombed flat by airplanes of the new French government, referred to only as the "Paris Multiracial Commune". Within a few years, most Western governments have surrendered. The mayor of [[New York City]] is made to share [[Gracie Mansion]] with three [[African-American]] families from [[Harlem]], migrants gather at coastal ports in West Africa and South Asia and swarm into [[Europe]], [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]], London is taken over by an organization of non-white residents known as the "Non-European Commonwealth Committee" which force the [[Elizabeth II|British queen]] to have her son marry a [[Pakistan]]i woman, millions of [[black Africans]] from around the continent gather at the [[Limpopo River]] and invade [[apartheid]] [[South Africa]], and only one drunken [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] soldier stands in the way of hundreds of thousands of Chinese peasants as they overrun Siberia.

The epilogue reveals that the story was written in the last holdout of the Western world, [[Switzerland]], but international pressure from the new governments, isolating it as a [[rogue state]] for not opening its borders, and the internal pro-migrant elements, force it to capitulate as well. Mere hours from the border opening, the author dedicates the book to his grandchildren, in the hopes they will grow up in a world where they will not be ashamed of him for writing such a book.

In 2001, the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] described it as "widely revered by American white supremacists and is a sort of anti-immigration analog to ''[[The Turner Diaries]]'',"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2015/racist-book-camp-saints-gains-popularity Racist Book, Camp of the Saints, Gains in Popularity], ''[[Intelligence Report]]'', March 21, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; and in October 2015, condemned the novel as "the favorite racist fantasy of the anti-immigrant movement in the US."&lt;ref name="splc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?sid=172|title=Intelligence Report|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ryan Lenz of the SPLC notes that "[t]he premise of ''Camp of the Saints'' plays directly into that idea of white genocide. It is the idea that through immigration, if it's left unchecked, the racial character and content of a culture can be undermined to the point of oblivion."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/146925/notorious-book-ties-right-far-right|title=The Notorious Book that Ties the Right to the Far Right|last=Jones|first=Sarah|date=|work=The New Republic|access-date=2018-03-28|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, [[Lionel Shriver]] described the novel as "both prescient and appalling," certainly "racist" but "written with tremendous verbal energy and passion." Shriver writes that the book "gives bilious voice to an emotion whose expression is increasingly taboo in the West, but that can grow only more virulent when suppressed: the fierce resentment felt by majority populations when that status seems threatened."&lt;ref name="shriver"&gt;[[Lionel Shriver]]: [http://www.newstatesman.com/node/190781 "Population doomsday"], ''[[New Statesman]]'', 10 June 2002, retrieved 1 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Servilestate.jpg|thumbnail|A copy of the original issuing of The Servile State, first published in 1912 by [[London &amp; Edinburgh: T.N. Foulis]].]]

'''''The Servile State''''' is a book written by [[Hilaire Belloc]] in 1912 about economics.  Although it mentions [[distributism]], for which he and his friend [[G. K. Chesterton]] are famous,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Maisie | last = Ward | title = Gilbert Keith Chesterton | year = 2005 | publisher = Sheed &amp; Ward | page = 433 | isbn = 9781461602538 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; it avoids explicit advocacy of that economic system.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

==Overview==
This book lays out, in very broad outline, Belloc's version of European economic history, starting with ancient pagan states, in which [[slavery]] was critical to the economy, through the [[medieval]] Christendom process which transformed an economy based on [[serf]] labour in a state in which the property was well distributed, to 19th and 20th century capitalism.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} Belloc argues that the development of capitalism was not a natural consequence of the [[Industrial Revolution]], but a consequence of the earlier [[dissolution of the monasteries]] in England, which then shaped the course of English industrialisation. English capitalism then spread across the world.

Belloc then makes his case for the natural instability of pure capitalism and discusses how he believes that attempts to reform capitalism will lead almost inexorably to an economy in which state regulation has removed the freedom of capitalism and thereby replaced capitalism with the Servile State, which shares with ancient slavery the fact that [[positive law]] (as opposed to custom or economic necessity by themselves) dictates that certain people will work for others, who likewise must take care of them.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

In the ninth section of the book, titled "The Servile State Has Begun," Belloc explores various ways the servile state has started to creep its way back into modern life. Among these he includes minimum wage laws, employers liability laws, the [[National Insurance Act 1911|Insurance Act]], and compulsory arbitration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Hilaire | isbn = 9781602068674 | last = Belloc | title = The Servile State | pages = 109–30 | year = 1912 | url = http://ldataworks.com/aqr/H_Belloc_The_Servile_State.pdf}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Belloc used his [[Catholicism]] and his experience of living alongside the small-scale peasant farmers of the [[Sussex Weald]] to advocate his thesis of having a property-owning democracy based on peasant smallholdings that would bring together the different social classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Peter|last=Brandon|title=The Discovery of Sussex|page=217|publisher=Phillimore &amp; Co Ltd|isbn =978-1860776168|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[George Orwell]] described the work as written in a "tiresome style" and argued that the remedy it suggested was "impossible". However, he considered that it foretold the sorts of things that were happening in the 1930s with "remarkable insight".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = George | last = Orwell | title = Second Thoughts on [[James Burnham]] | journal = [[Polemic (magazine)|Polemic]] | volume = 3 |date=May 1946}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenneth Minogue]]'s book ''The Servile Mind''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = Encounter Books | isbn = 9781594036514 | first = Kenneth | last = Minoque | title = The Servile Mind: How Democracy Erodes the Moral Life | year = 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was inspired by Belloc's book. Minogue described Belloc's book as somewhat dated but still offering valuable insights into the development of [[wikt:servile|servility]] and dependence on government largesse, which Minogue tended to regard unfavorably. [[Austrian School]] economist [[Friedrich von Hayek]] praised the truth of Belloc's predictions in his book ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | isbn = 9780226320533 | first = F.A. | last = Hayek | title = The Road to Serfdom | page = 13 | year = 1944 | url = http://www.tiptopwebsite.com/custommusic2/mrsilber2.pdf}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and subtitled his chapter, "Economic Control and Totalitarianism", with the quote from The Servile State, "the control of the production of wealth is the control of human life itself."

The '''Treaty establishing the European Defence Community''' is an unratified treaty signed on 27 May 1952 by the [[Inner Six|six 'inner']] countries of [[European integration]]; West Germany, France, Italy, and the [[Benelux]] countries. The treaty would have created a European Defence Community (EDC) with a pan-European defence force. The treaty failed to obtain ratification in the French parliament, and consequently never entered into force. Instead, West Germany was admitted into the [[Western European Union]] (WEU), a dormant successor of the 1948 [[Western Union (alliance)|Western Union]], as well as [[NATO]].

The treaty was initiated by the ''Pleven plan'', proposed in 1950 by then French Prime Minister [[René Pleven]] in response to the American call for the rearmament of [[West Germany]]. The formation of a pan-European defence architecture, as an alternative to West Germany's proposed accession to [[NATO]], was meant to harness the German military potential in case of conflict with the [[Soviet bloc]]. Just as the [[Schuman Declaration|Schuman Plan]] was designed to end the risk Germany having the economic power on its own to make war again, the Pleven Plan and EDC were meant to prevent the military possibility of Germany's making war again.

==Planned organisation==
The European Defence Community would have entailed a pan-European military, divided into national components, and had a common budget, common arms, centralized military procurement and institutions.
[[File:Organisation of the European Defence Community.png|thumb|center|500px|Diagram showing the functioning of the institutions provided for by the Treaty establishing the European Defence Community (EDC), the placing of Member States’ armed forces (European Defence Forces) at the disposal of the Community, and the link between the EDC and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO).]]
===Reporting===
In this military, the French, Italian, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourgish components would report to their national governments, whereas the West German component would report to the EDC. This was due to the fear of a return of [[Militarism#Germany|German militarism]], so it was desired that the [[German government]] would not have control over the German military. However, in the event of its rejection, it was agreed to let the West German government control its own military in any case (something which the treaty would not have provided).

== History ==
{{History of the European Union}}
===Background===
During the late 40s, the divisions created by the [[Cold War]] were becoming more and more evident. The United States looked with suspicion at the growing power of the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] and European states felt vulnerable, fearing a possible Soviet occupation. In this climate of mistrust and suspicion, the United States considered the rearmament of West Germany as a possible solution to enhance the security of Europe and of the whole [[Western Bloc|Western bloc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Rise and Fall of the European Defence Community: Anglo-American Relations and the Crisis of European Defense, 1950–55|last=Ruane|first=Kevin|publisher=|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=1, 2|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1950, [[Dean Acheson]] proposed a new plan to the European states; the American plan, called ''package,'' sought to enhance NATO's defense structure, creating 12 West German divisions. However, after the destruction that Germany had caused during [[World War II]], European countries, and in particular France, were not ready to see the reconstruction of the German military.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Rise and Fall of the European Defence Community: Anglo-American Relations and the Crisis of European Defense, 1950–55|last=Ruane|first=Kevin|publisher=|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=4|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finding themselves in the midst of the two superpowers, they looked at this situation as a possibility to enhance the [[European integration|integration process]], trying to obviate the loss of military influence caused by the new bipolar order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Background for the European Defence Community|journal=Political Science Quarterly|volume=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pleven Plan===
{{Wikisource|Pleven Plan}}
On 24 October 1950, France's Prime Minister [[René Pleven]] proposed a new plan, which took his name although it was drafted mainly by [[Jean Monnet]], that aimed to create a supranational [[European Army]]. With this project, France tried to satisfy America's demands, avoiding, at the same time, the creation of German divisions, and thus the rearmament of Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Rise and Fall of the European Defence Community: Anglo-American Relations and the Crisis of European Defense, 1950–55|last=Ruane|first=Kevin|publisher=|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=4, 5|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Guillen, "France and the Defence of Western Europe: From the Brussels Pact (March 1948) to the Pleven Plan (October 1950)." in ''The Western Security Community: Common Problems and Conflicting Interests during the Foundation Phase of the North Atlantic Alliance,'' ed. Norbert Wigershaus and Roland G. Foerster (1993), pp. 125–48.&lt;/ref&gt;  The EDC was to include West Germany, France, Italy, and the [[Benelux]] countries.  The United States would be excluded.  It was a competitor to NATO (in which the US played the dominant role), with France playing the dominant role. Just as the [[Schuman Declaration|Schuman Plan]] was designed to end the risk of Germany having the economic power to make war again, the Pleven Plan and EDC were meant to prevent the same possibility. The United Kingdom refused to join.&lt;ref&gt;Alex May, ''Britain and Europe since 1945'' (1999) pp. 18–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Pleven Plan, the European Army was supposed to be composed of military units from the member states, and directed by a council of the member states’ ministers.

===Negotiations and signing===
France feared the loss of national sovereignty in security and defense, and thus a truly supranational European Army could not be tolerated by Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = European Security and Defense Policy: From Taboo to a Spearhead of EU Foreign Policy|last = Keukeleire|first = Stephan|publisher = |year = 2009|isbn = |location = |pages = 52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because of the strong American interest in a West German army, a draft agreement for a modified Pleven Plan, renamed the [[European Defense Community]] (EDC), was ready in May 1952, with French support.  The new EDC treaty was signed on 27 May 1952.

Although with some doubts and hesitation, the United States and the six members of the [[European Economic Community|European Community]] approved the Pleven Plan. This led the way to the Paris Conference, launched in February 1951, where it was negotiated the structure of the supranational army. Among compromises and differences, on 27 May 1952 the six foreign ministers signed the Treaty of Paris establishing the European Defence Community (EDC).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Rise and Fall of the European Defence Community: Anglo-American Relations and the Crisis of European Defense, 1950-55|last=Ruane|first=Kevin|publisher=|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=15|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1954: French failure to ratify===
Despite the central role for France, the EDC plan collapsed when it failed to obtain ratification in the [[French Parliament]]. The reasons that led to the failed ratification of the Treaty were twofold, concerning major changes in the international scene, as well as domestic problems of the [[French Fourth Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The European Defense Community in the French National Assembly: A Roll Call Analysis|journal=Comparative Politics|volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were [[Gaullist]] fears that the EDC threatened France's [[national sovereignty]], constitutional concerns about the indivisibility of the French Republic, and fears about West Germany's remilitarization. French Communists opposed a plan tying France to the capitalist [[United States]] and setting it in opposition to the [[Communist bloc]]. Other legislators worried about the absence of the [[United Kingdom]]. The EDC went for ratification in the French National Assembly on 30 August 1954, and failed by a vote of 319 against 264. By this time, concerns about a future conflict faded with the death of [[Joseph Stalin]] and the end of the [[Korean War]]. Concomitant to these fears were a severe disjuncture between the original [[Pleven Plan]] of 1950 and the one defeated in 1954. Divergences included military integration at the division rather than battalion level and a change in the command structure putting the NATO Supreme Commander in charge of EDC operational capabilities. Italy also never ratified the treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://eeas.europa.eu/topics/common-security-and-defence-policy-csdp/5388/shaping-of-a-common-security-and-defence-policy-_en|title=Shaping of a Common Security and Defence Policy|date=2016-07-08|accessdate=2017-11-04|publisher=[[European External Action Service]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-17-1517_en.htm|title=Questions and Answers: the Future of European Defence|date=2017-06-07|accessdate=2017-11-04|publisher=[[European External Action Service]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Then French Prime Minister, [[Pierre Mendès-France]], tried to placate the treaty's detractors by attempting to ratify additional protocols with the other signatory states. These included the sole integration of covering forces, or in other words, those deployed within West Germany, as well as the implementation of greater national autonomy in regard to  budgetary and other administrative questions. Britain approved of the plan in principle, but agreed to join only if the supranational element was decreased.

===Reaction===
The treaty never went into effect.  Instead, after the failed ratification in the French National Assembly, Germany was admitted into NATO&lt;ref&gt;Josef Joffe, "Europe's American Pacifier,"  ''Foreign Policy'' (1984) 54#1 pp. 64–82 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1148355 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; and the EC member states tried to create foreign policy cooperation in the De Gaulle-sponsored [[Fouchet Plan]] (1959&amp;ndash;1962). European foreign policy was finally established during the third attempt with [[European Political Cooperation]] (EPC) (1970). This became the predecessor of the [[Common Foreign and Security Policy]] (CFSP).

Today the [[European Union]] and [[NATO]], and formerly also the [[Western European Union]], all carry out some of the functions which was envisaged for the EDC, although none approach the degree of [[Supranationalism|supranational]] military control that the EDC would have provided for.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2680">'''The Union of Young Fascists – Vanguard''' ({{lang-ru|Союз Юных Фашисток — Авангард}}, ''Soyuz Yunykh Fashistok — Avangard'') was the young women's youth organization of the [[Russian Fascist Party]]. It was founded in 1934 in [[Harbin]], and was open to Russian girls aged 10 to 16 years.

The main objective of the Union was "the preparation of national-minded Russian young women and girls to responsible national service based on religion, nationalism, and work".

The ideology and tactics of the Union were entirely determined by members of the Russian Fascist Party. Membership was obtained on recommendation of an existing member of the Vanguard or a member of the senior Russian Fascist Party.

The Union was divided into two groups, Junior (10 to 13 years) and Senior (13 to 16 years). Each group was divided into two categories: Second Level (Young Fascists) and First Level (Avangardistki).

Commanding officers in the Union were the Senior Source, the Senior District Commander, and Senior Divisional Commander.

The lowest structural unit in the Union was the "Focus", a group of five people. Several of these that were geographically close to each other formed a District, and together with other suburban areas or units otherwise related, they formed a Department. The head of the group was appointed by the head of the Russian Fascist Party, the others were appointed by their respective commanders.

The uniform consisted of a white blouse with a black tie and a black skirt.&lt;ref&gt;''The Russian Fascists: Tragedy and Farce in Exile, 1925—1945'' by John J. Stephan {{ISBN|0-06-014099-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''United Left''' ({{lang-de|Vereinigte Linke}}) was an alliance of several [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] opposition groupings in the [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]]. Among them were [[Christian socialism|Christian Socialists]], [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]], adherents of the [[Titoism|Titoistic]] system of [[Workers' self-management|self-management]] and some [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]] (SED) members, who were critical of their party's policy.

==History==
Founded on October 2, 1989, only a few weeks before the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], the United Left demanded a reformation of [[socialism]] with the stated goal of creating a free and democratic GDR. At the end of the year 1989 the party had 1500 members with focal points in [[Berlin]] and [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]]. In contrast to other East German opposition groups, the United Left received less support from Western governments and political parties. Organisational issues and internal tensions between the various ideological factions meant that the United Left only achieved limited political success during its existence.

At the first free elections in the GDR in March 1990 the United Left started together with "''{{ill|Die Nelken|de}}''" ("The Carnations"), a [[Marxism|Marxist]] party. The electoral alliance with the name "''Aktionsbündnis Vereinigte Linke''" gained 0.18% of the votes and one seat in the [[Volkskammer]]. The United Left fell apart in the years after [[German reunification]], but some members were elected to the [[Bundestag]] through a party-list of the [[Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)|PDS]] or [[Alliance 90/The Greens|The Greens]].
