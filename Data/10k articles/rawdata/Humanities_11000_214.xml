{{Feminism sidebar|Variants (general)}}
'''Anarcha-feminism''', also called '''anarchist feminism''' and '''anarcho-feminism''', combines [[anarchism]] with [[feminism]]. It generally views [[patriarchy]] and traditional [[gender role]]s as a manifestation of involuntary [[Coercion|coercive]] [[hierarchy]] that should be replaced by [[Decentralization|decentralized]] [[Free association (communism and anarchism)|free association]]. They believe that the struggle against patriarchy is an essential part of [[class conflict]] and the anarchist struggle against the [[State (polity)|state]] and [[capitalism]]. In essence, the philosophy sees anarchist struggle as a necessary component of feminist struggle and vice versa. [[L. Susan Brown]] claims that "as anarchism is a political philosophy that opposes all relationships of power, it is inherently feminist".&lt;ref&gt;Brown, p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to popular belief and contemporary association with [[radical feminism]], anarcha-feminism is not an inherently [[militant]] outlook. It is described to be an [[Anti-authoritarianism|anti-authoritarian]], [[Anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]], anti-oppressive philosophy, with the goal of creating an "equal ground" between all genders. The term "anarcha-feminism" suggests the social freedom and liberty of women, without needed dependence upon other groups or parties.

== Origins ==
[[Mikhail Bakunin]] opposed [[patriarchy]] and the way the law "[subjected women] to the absolute domination of the man". He argued that "[e]qual rights must belong to men and women" so that women could "become independent and be free to forge their own way of life". Bakunin foresaw the end of "the [[authoritarian]] [[juridical]] [[family]]" and "the full sexual freedom of women".&lt;ref name=FAQ&gt;An Anarchist FAQ. [http://www.infoshop.org/faq/secA3.html What is Anarcha-Feminism?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922025342/http://www.infoshop.org/faq/secA3.html |date=September 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Mikhail Bakunin|Bakunin, Mikhail]] (ed. Sam Dolgoff), ''Bakunin on Anarchy'', Vintage Books, 1971: [http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1873/statism-anarchy.htm "Statism and Anarchy" (1873)], p.&amp;nbsp;346–347: "[The family patriarch] is simultaneously a slave and a despot: a despot exerting his tyranny over all those under his roof and dependent on his will."&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] viewed the [[family]] as the most basic unit of society and of his morality and believed that women had the responsibility of fulfilling a traditional role within the family.&lt;ref&gt;Broude, N. and M. Garrard (1992). ''The Expanding Discourse: Feminism And Art History.'' p. 303. Westview Press. {{ISBN|978-0-06-430207-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-editorial-collective-an-anarchist-faq-14-17 An Anarchist FAQ (14/17): Section 3 – The Anarchist Library]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1860s, anarchism's radical critique of [[capitalism]] and the state has been combined with a critique of patriarchy. Anarcha-feminists thus start from the precept that modern society is dominated by men. Authoritarian traits and values—domination, exploitation, aggression and competition—are integral to [[hierarchical]] civilizations and are seen as "masculine". In contrast, non-authoritarian traits and values—cooperation, sharing, compassion and sensitivity—are regarded as "feminine" and devalued. Anarcha-feminists have thus espoused creation of a non-authoritarian, anarchist society. They refer to the creation of a society based on [[cooperation]], sharing and [[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution|mutual aid]] as the "[[Feminization (sociology)|feminization]] of society".&lt;ref name = FAQ/&gt;

Anarcha-feminism began with late 19th and early 20th century authors and theorists such as anarchist feminists [[Emma Goldman]], [[Voltairine de Cleyre]] and [[Lucy Parsons]].&lt;ref&gt;Dunbar-Ortiz, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Spanish Civil War]], an anarcha-feminist group, {{lang|es|[[Mujeres Libres]]}} ("Free Women"), linked to the {{lang|es|[[Federación Anarquista Ibérica]]}}, organized to defend both anarchist and feminist ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Ackelsberg.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stirner]]ist [[Anarchism and Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]an feminist [[Federica Montseny]] held that the "emancipation of women would lead to a quicker realization of the social revolution" and that "the revolution against sexism would have to come from intellectual and militant 'future-women'". According to this Nietzschean concept of Federica Montseny's, women could "realize through art and literature the need to revise their own roles".&lt;ref name="anarchonietzche"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://radicalarchives.org/2010/05/18/nietzsche-and-the-anarchists/ |title=Spencer Sunshine: "Nietzsche and the Anarchists" (2005) |work=Fifth Estate |volume=367 |pages=36–37 |publisher=radicalarchives.org |date=Winter 2004–2005 |accessdate=2012-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In China, the anarcha-feminist [[He Zhen (anarchist)|He Zhen]] argued that without women's liberation society could not be liberated.{{sfnb|Liu|2013|p= 53}}

=== Virginia Bolten and ''La Voz de la Mujer'' ===
[[File:8La Voz de la Mujer.jpg|thumb|left|Cover of ''{{lang|es|La Voz de la Mujer}}'', pioneering Argentinian anarchist feminist publication]]
{{multiple image|align=right|direction=vertical|image1=Anarchist Feminism flag 3.2 ratio.svg|caption1=Flag of anarcha-feminism|image2=Anarcha-feminism.svg|caption2=Another symbol of anarchist feminism: in the center of the [[Venus symbol]] is a [[raised fist]]}}
In Argentina, [[Virginia Bolten]] is responsible for the publication of a newspaper called ''{{lang|es|[[La Voz de la Mujer]]}}'' (''{{lang-en|The Woman's Voice}}''), which was published nine times in Rosario between January 8, 1896 and January 1, 1897 and was briefly revived in 1901. A similar paper with the same name was reportedly published later in [[Montevideo]], which suggests that Bolten may also have founded and edited it after her deportation.&lt;ref name="molyneux"&gt;{{cite book|last=Molyneux|first=Maxine|title=Women's movements in international perspective: Latin America and beyond|publisher=Palgrave MacMillan|year=2001|page=24|isbn=978-0-333-78677-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yg9HFrOG89kC&amp;pg=PA24}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''La Voz de la Mujer'' described itself as "dedicated to the advancement of Communist Anarchism". Its central theme was the multiple natures of women's oppression. An editorial asserted: "We believe that in present-day society, nothing and nobody has a more wretched situation than unfortunate women". They said that women were doubly oppressed by both bourgeois society and men. Its beliefs can be seen from its attack on marriage and upon male power over women. Its contributors, like anarchist feminists elsewhere, developed a concept of oppression that focused on gender. They saw marriage as a bourgeois institution which restricted women's freedom, including their sexual freedom. Marriages entered into without love, fidelity maintained through fear rather than desire and oppression of women by men they hated were all seen as symptomatic of the coercion implied by the marriage contract. It was this alienation of the individual's will that the anarchist feminists deplored and sought to remedy, initially through free love and then more thoroughly through social revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libcom.org/history/no-god-no-boss-no-husband-world%E2%80%99s-first-anarcha-feminist-group |title=No God, No Boss, No Husband: The world's first Anarcha-Feminist group |publisher=Libcom.org |date=January 3, 2012 |accessdate=2012-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Individualist anarchism and the free love movement ==
{{main|Individualist anarchism|Free love}}
[[File:Lucifer, The Light-Bearer.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''[[Lucifer the Lightbearer]]'', an influential American free love journal]]
An important topic within [[individualist anarchism]] is [[free love]].&lt;ref name="freelove"&gt;{{cite web|last=McElroy |first=Wendy |url=http://www.ncc-1776.org/tle1996/le961210.html |title=The Free Love Movement and Radical Individualism |publisher=The Libertarian Enterprise |date=December 1, 1996 |accessdate=2012-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Free love advocates sometimes traced their roots back to [[Josiah Warren]] and to experimental communities, which viewed sexual freedom as a clear, direct expression of an individual's self-ownership. Free love particularly stressed [[women's rights]] since most sexual laws discriminated against women, such as marriage laws and anti-birth control measures.&lt;ref name="freelove"/&gt; The most important American free love journal was ''[[Lucifer the Lightbearer]]'' (1883–1907), edited by [[Moses Harman]] and [[Lois Waisbrooker]].&lt;ref&gt;Passet, Joanne E. "Power through Print: Lois Waisbrooker and Grassroots Feminism," in: ''Women in Print: Essays on the Print Culture of American Women from the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries'', James Philip Danky and Wayne A. Wiegand, eds., Madison, WI, University of Wisconsin Press, 2006; pp. 229-50.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ezra Heywood|Ezra]] and Angela Heywood's ''[[The Word (free love)|The Word]]'' was also published from 1872–1890 and in 1892–1893.&lt;ref name="freelove"/&gt; [[M. E. Lazarus]] was also an important American individualist anarchist who promoted free love.&lt;ref name="freelove"/&gt; In Europe, the main propagandist of free love within individualist anarchism was [[Émile Armand]].&lt;ref name="armandfreelove"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iisg.nl/womhist/manfreuk.pdf |title=E. Armand and "la camaraderie amoureuse": Revolutionary sexualism and the struggle against jealousy |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed the concept of "''{{lang|fr|la camaraderie amoureuse}}''" to speak of free love as the possibility of voluntary sexual encounter between consenting adults. He was also a consistent proponent of [[polyamory]].&lt;ref name="armandfreelove"/&gt; In France, there was also feminist activity inside [[Individualist anarchism in Europe#France|French individualist anarchism]] as promoted by [[individualist feminist]]s Marie Küge, Anna Mahé, [[Rirette Maîtrejean]] and Sophia Zaïkovska.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://endehors.org/news/individualisme-anarchiste-et-feminisme-a-la-belle-epoque |title="Individualisme anarchiste et féminisme à la " Belle Epoque "" |publisher=Endehors.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120706170427/http://endehors.org/news/individualisme-anarchiste-et-feminisme-a-la-belle-epoque |archivedate=July 6, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mlacerda.png|thumb|150px|[[Maria Lacerda de Moura]], [[Anarchism in Brazil|Brazilian anarchist]] [[Individualist anarchism|individualist]] and [[Anarchist feminism|feminist]]]]
Brazilian [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchist]] [[Maria Lacerda de Moura]] lectured on topics such as education, women's rights, free love and [[antimilitarism]]. Her writings and essays landed her attention not only in Brazil, but also in [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]]. In February 1923, she launched ''{{lang|pt|Renascença}}'', a periodical linked with the anarchist, [[progressivism|progressive]] and [[freethought|freethinking]] circles of the period. Her thought was mainly influenced by individualist anarchists such as [[Han Ryner]] and Émile Armand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nodo50.org/insurgentes/textos/mulher/09marialacerda.htm |title="Maria Lacerda de Moura - Uma Anarquista Individualista Brasileira" by |publisher=Nodo50.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Voltairine de Cleyre ===
[[Voltairine de Cleyre]] (November 17, 1866 – June 20, 1912) was an [[Anarchism in the United States|American anarchist]] writer and feminist. She was a prolific writer and speaker, opposing the state, marriage and the domination of religion in sexuality and women's lives. She began her activist career in the [[freethought|freethought movement]]. De Cleyre was initially drawn to [[individualist anarchism]], but evolved through [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] to an "[[anarchism without adjectives]]". She was a colleague of [[Emma Goldman]], with whom she respectfully disagreed with on many issues. Many of her essays were in the ''Collected Works of Voltairine de Cleyre'', published posthumously by ''[[Mother Earth (magazine)|Mother Earth]]'' in 1914. In her 1895 lecture entitled ''Sex Slavery,'' de Cleyre condemns ideals of beauty that encourage women to distort their bodies and child socialization practices that create unnatural [[gender role]]s. The title of the essay refers not to traffic in women for purposes of [[prostitution]], although that is also mentioned, but rather to marriage laws that allow men to [[marital rape|rape]] their wives without consequences. Such laws make "every married woman what she is, a bonded slave, who takes her master's name, her master's bread, her master's commands, and serves her master's passions".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|De Cleyre|2005|p=228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emma Goldman ===
[[File:Emma Goldman seated.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Emma Goldman]]]]
[[File:Voltairine de Cleyre (Age 35).jpg|thumb|150px|[[Voltairine de Cleyre]]]]
Although she was hostile to [[first-wave feminism]] and its suffragist goals, [[Emma Goldman]] advocated passionately for the rights of women and is today heralded as a founder of anarcha-feminism. In 1897, she wrote: "I demand the independence of woman, her right to support herself; to live for herself; to love whomever she pleases, or as many as she pleases. I demand freedom for both sexes, freedom of action, freedom in love and freedom in motherhood".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Wexler, ''Intimate'', p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1906, Goldman wrote a piece entitled "The Tragedy of Woman's Emancipation"&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, Emma. "The Tragedy of Woman's Emancipation." ''The Feminist Papers: From Adams to De Beauvoir''. Ed. Alice Rossi. Boston: Northeastern UP, 1988. 508-16. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; in which she argued that traditional suffragists and first-wave feminists were achieving only a superficial good for women by pursuing the vote and a movement from the home sphere. She also writes that in the ideal world women would be free to pursue their own destinies, yet "emancipation of woman, as interpreted and practically applied today, has failed to reach that great end".&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, "Tragedy", p.510.&lt;/ref&gt; She pointed to the "so-called independence"&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, "Tragedy", p.511&lt;/ref&gt; of the modern woman whose true nature—her love and mother instincts—were rebuked and stifled by the suffragist and early feminist movements. Goldman's arguments in this text are arguably much more in line with the ideals of modern [[third-wave feminism]] than with the feminism of her time, especially given her emphasis on allowing women to pursue marriage and motherhood if they so desired. In Goldman's eyes, the early twentieth century idea of the emancipated woman had a "tragic effect upon the inner life of woman"&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, "Tragedy", p.513&lt;/ref&gt; by restricting her from fully fulfilling her nature and having a well-rounded life with a companion in marriage.

A nurse by training, Goldman was an early advocate for educating women about [[birth control]]. Like many contemporary feminists, she saw [[abortion]] as a tragic consequence of social conditions and birth control as a positive alternative. Goldman was also an advocate of [[free love]] and a strong critic of [[marriage]]. She saw early feminists as confined in their scope and bounded by social forces of [[Religious fanaticism|Puritanism]] and [[capitalism]]. She wrote: "We are in need of unhampered growth out of old traditions and habits. The movement for women's emancipation has so far made but the first step in that direction".&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, ''Anarchism'', p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See generally Haaland; Goldman, "The Traffic in Women"; Goldman, "On Love".&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Margaret Sanger]], an advocate of access to birth control, coined the term "birth control" and disseminated information about various methods in the June 1914 issue of her magazine ''The Woman Rebel'', she received aggressive support from Goldman. Sanger was arrested in August under the [[Comstock laws]], which prohibited the dissemination of "obscene, lewd, or lascivious articles"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Wexler, ''Intimate'', p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;—including information relating to birth control. Although they later split from Sanger over charges of insufficient support, Goldman and Reitman distributed copies of Sanger's pamphlet ''Family Limitation'' (along with a similar essay of Reitman's). In 1915, Goldman conducted a nationwide speaking tour in part to raise awareness about contraception options. Although the nation's attitude toward the topic seemed to be liberalizing, Goldman was arrested in February 1916 and charged with violation of the Comstock Law. Refusing to pay a $100 fine, she spent two weeks in a prison workhouse, which she saw as an "opportunity" to reconnect with those rejected by society.&lt;ref&gt;Wexler, ''Intimate'', pp. 211–215.&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldman was also an outspoken critic of [[Homophobia|prejudice against homosexuals]]. Her belief that social liberation should extend to gay men and lesbians was virtually unheard of at the time, even among anarchists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Katz|first=Jonathan Ned|title=Gay American History: Lesbians and Gay Men in the U.S.A.|year=1992|location=New York City|publisher=Penguin Books|pages=376–380}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] wrote, "she was the first and only woman, indeed the first and only American, to take up the defense of homosexual love before the general public".&lt;ref name="hirschfeld"&gt;Goldman, Emma (1923). "Offener Brief an den Herausgeber der Jahrbücher über Louise Michel" with a preface by Magnus Hirschfeld. ''Jahrbuch für sexuelle Zwischenstufen'' 23: 70. Translated from German by James Steakley. Goldman's original letter in English is not known to be extant.&lt;/ref&gt; In numerous speeches and letters, she defended the right of gay men and lesbians to love as they pleased and condemned the fear and stigma associated with homosexuality. As Goldman wrote in a letter to Hirschfeld: "It is a tragedy, I feel, that people of a different sexual type are caught in a world which shows so little understanding for homosexuals and is so crassly indifferent to the various gradations and variations of gender and their great significance in life".&lt;ref name="hirschfeld"/&gt;

=== Milly Witkop ===
[[Milly Witkop]] was a Ukrainian-born Jewish [[Anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalist]], [[Feminism|feminist]] writer and activist. She was the [[Common-law marriage|common-law wife]] of  [[Rudolf Rocker]]. In November 1918, Witkop and Rocker moved to [[Berlin]]; Rocker had been invited by [[Free Association of German Trade Unions]] (FVdG) chairman [[Fritz Kater]] to join him in building up what would become the [[Free Workers' Union of Germany]] (FAUD), an [[anarcho-syndicalist]] trade union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vallance|first=Margaret|date=July 1973|title=Rudolf Rocker—a biographical sketch|journal=Journal of Contemporary History|volume=8|issue=3|pages=75–95|publisher=Sage Publications|location=London/Beverly Hills|issn=0022-0094|oclc=49976309|doi=10.1177/002200947300800304}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Rocker and Witkop became members of the FAUD.&lt;ref name=Wolf&gt;{{de icon}}Wolf, Siegbert: [http://www.dadaweb.de/wiki/Witkop,_Milly Witkop, Milly] in ''Datenbank des deutschsprachigen Anarchismus''. Retrieved October 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; After its founding in early 1919, a discussion about the role of girls and women in the union started. The male-dominated organization had at first ignored gender issues, but soon women started founding their own unions, which were organized parallel to the regular unions, but still formed part of the FAUD. Witkop was one of the leading founders of the Women's Union in Berlin in 1920. On October 15, 1921, the women's unions held a national congress in [[Düsseldorf]] and the [[Syndicalist Women's Union]] (SFB) was founded on a national level. Shortly thereafter, Witkop drafted ''Was will der Syndikalistische Frauenbund?'' (''What Does the Syndicalist Women's Union Want?'') as a platform for the SFB. From 1921, the ''Frauenbund'' was published as a supplement to the FAUD organ ''[[Der Syndikalist]]'', Witkop was one of its primary writers.&lt;ref name=Wolf/&gt;

Witkop reasoned that proletarian women were exploited not only by capitalism like male workers, but also by their male counterparts. She contended therefore that women must actively fight for their rights, much like workers must fight capitalism for theirs. She also insisted on the necessity of women taking part in class struggle and that housewives could use boycotts to support this struggle. From this, she concluded the necessity of an autonomous women's organization in the FAUD. Witkop also held that domestic work should be deemed equally valuable to wage labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rübner|first=Hartmut|title=Freiheit und Brot: Die Freie Arbeiter-Union Deutschlands: Eine Studie zur Geschichte des Anarchosyndikalismus|year=1994|publisher=Libertad Verlag|location=Berlin/Cologne|language=German|isbn=3-922226-21-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''{{lang|es|[[Mujeres Libres]]}}'' (''{{lang-en|Free Women}}'') was an anarchist women's organization in Spain that aimed to empower working class women. It was founded in 1936 by [[Lucía Sánchez Saornil]], [[Mercedes Comaposada]] and [[Amparo Poch y Gascón]] and had approximately 30,000 members. The organization was based on the idea of a "double struggle" for [[Feminist movement|women's liberation]] and [[social revolution]] and argued that the two objectives were equally important and should be pursued in parallel. In order to gain mutual support, they created networks of women anarchists. Flying day-care centres were set up in efforts to involve more women in union activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Aileen |last=O'Carroll |url=http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/ws98/ws54_mujeres_libres.html |title=Mujeres Libres: Women anarchists in the Spanish Revolution |publisher=Workers Solidarity |issue=54 |date=June 1998 |accessdate=2012-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926095452/http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/ws98/ws54_mujeres_libres.html |archivedate=2015-09-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization also produced propaganda through radio, traveling libraries and propaganda tours in order to promote their cause. Organizers and activists traveled through rural parts of Spain to set up rural collectives and support for women.&lt;ref name="WS54"&gt;{{cite web | author=O'Carroll, Aileen | title=Mujeres Libres:  Women anarchists in the Spanish Revolution | work=Workers Solidarity No 54 | url=http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/ws98/ws54_mujeres_libres.html | accessdate=September 27, 2005 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926095452/http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/ws98/ws54_mujeres_libres.html | archivedate=September 26, 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; To prepare women for leadership roles in the anarchist movement, they organized schools, women-only social groups and a women-only newspaper to help women gain [[self-esteem]] and confidence in their abilities and network with one another to develop their [[political consciousness]]. Many of the female workers in Spain were illiterate and the ''Mujeres Libres'' sought to educate them through literacy programs, technically oriented classes and  social studies classes. Schools were also created for train nurses to help injured in emergency medical clinics.&lt;ref name="WS54"/&gt; Medical classes also provided women with information on sexual health and pre and post-natal care.&lt;ref name="WS54"/&gt; The ''Mujeres Libres'' also created a woman run magazine to keep all of its members informed. The first monthly issue of ''Mujeres Libres'' was published on May 20, 1936 (ack 100). However, the magazine only had 14 issues and the last issue was still being printed when the Spanish Civil War battlefront reached Barcelona, and no copies survived. The magazine addressed working class women and focused on "awakening the female conscience toward libertarian ideas".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Porter|first=David|title=Vision on Fire: Emma Goldman on the Spanish Revolution|year=1938|publisher=Common Ground Press|location=New Paltz, NY|page=254}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Lucía Sánchez Saornil ====
[[File:Lucía Sánchez Saornil &amp; Emma Goldman.jpg|thumb|Saornil (left) and Goldman (center) in Spain during the 1930s]]
[[Lucía Sánchez Saornil]] (December 13, 1895 – June 2, 1970), was a Spanish poet, militant anarchist and feminist. She is best known as one of the founders of ''Mujeres Libres''. She served in the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] (CNT) and [[Solidaridad Internacional Antifascista]] (SIA). By 1919, she had been published in a variety of journals, including ''Los Quijotes'', ''Tableros'', ''Plural'', ''Manantial'' and ''La Gaceta Literaria''. Working under a male [[pen name]], she was able to explore [[lesbian]] themes&lt;ref&gt;"R. Fue una época transgresora, emergió el feminismo y la libertad sexual estuvo en el candelero. Hay rastreos de muchas lesbianas escritoras: Carmen Conde[primera académica de número], Victorina Durán, Margarita Xirgu, Ana María Sagi, la periodista Irene Polo, Lucía Sánchez Saornil, fundadora de Mujeres Libres[sección feminista de CNT]... Incluso existía un círculo sáfico en Madrid como lugar de encuentro y tertulia.P. ¿Se declaraban lesbianas?R. Había quien no se escondía mucho, como Polo o Durán, pero lesbiana era un insulto, algo innombrable. Excepto los poemas homosexuales de Sánchez Saornil, sus textos no eran explícitos para poder publicarlos, así que hay que reinterpretarlos."[http://elpais.com/diario/2007/12/06/paisvasco/1196973608_850215.html "Tener referentes serios de lesbianas elimina estereotipos" by Juan Fernandez at ''El Pais'']&lt;/ref&gt; at a time when homosexuality was criminalized and subject to [[censorship]] and punishment. Writing in anarchist publications such as ''Earth and Freedom'', the ''White Magazine'' and ''[[Solidaridad Obrera (periodical)|Workers' Solidarity]]'', Lucía outlined her perspective as a feminist. Although quiet on the subject of [[birth control]], she attacked the essentialism of [[gender roles]] in Spanish society. In this way, Lucía established herself as one of the most radical of voices among anarchist women, rejecting the ideal of female domesticity which remained largely unquestioned. In a series of articles for ''Workers' Solidarity'', she boldly refuted [[Gregorio Marañón]]'s identification of [[motherhood]] as the nucleus of female identity.&lt;ref&gt;Enders and Radcliff.

=== Italian migrant women ===
[[File:Ernestina Cravello.jpg|thumb|left|Sketch of [[Ernestina Cravello]] which appeared in the ''[[Evansville Courier]]'' on August 5, 1900 with the headline "Queen of Anarchists a Girl of Twenty"]]
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, [[Paterson, New Jersey]] was a major center of the anarchist movement. Most of the anarchists in the area were Italian migrants who worked in the mills and women played an important role in the movement.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmer (2015), p. 66. "Female anarchist migrants such as Ninfa Baronio and Maria Roda were few in number but immensely important."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Northern Italy|Northern Italian]] migrants [[Maria Roda]], [[Ernestina Cravello]] and [[Ninfa Baronio]] founded Paterson's ''Gruppo Emancipazione della Donna'' (Women's Emancipation Group) in 1897. The group gave lectures, wrote for the anarchist press, and published pamphlets. They also formed the ''Club Femminile de Musica e di Canto'' (Women's Music and Song Club) and the ''Teatro Sociale'' (Social Theater). The Teatro performed plays which challenged Catholic sexual morality&lt;ref&gt;Cornell (2016), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; and called for the emancipation of women. Their plays stood in marked contrast to other radical works in which women were depicted as victims in need of rescuing by male revolutionaries.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmer (2015), p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; They often traveled to perform their plays, and connected with other Italian anarchist women in [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]], [[Brooklyn]], [[Manhattan]] and [[New London, Connecticut]]. The Paterson group met regularly for about seven years and inspired other women to form similar groups.&lt;ref&gt;Guglielmo (2010), pp. 160, 162; Zimmer (2015), p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Their [[Southern Italy|Southern Italian]] contemporaries included Elvira Catello in [[East Harlem]], who ran a popular theater group and a radical bookstore;&lt;ref&gt;Guglielmo (2010), p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; Maria Raffuzzi in [[Manhattan]], who co-founded ''Il Gruppo di Propaganda Femminile'' (Women's Propaganda Group) in 1901;&lt;ref&gt;Guglielmo (2010), p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; and Maria Barbieri, an anarchist orator who helped organize the silk workers in Paterson.&lt;ref&gt;Guglielmo (2010), pp. 2, 164, 167, 172; Ferguson (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

Anarchist Italian women such as Maria Roda flouted convention and Catholic teaching by rejecting traditional marriage in favor of "free unions". In practice, these unions often turned out to be lifelong and monogamous, with the division of labor falling along traditional lines. The anarchist writer [[Ersilia Cavedagni]] believed that "the woman is and will always be the educator of the family, that which has and will always have the most direct and the most important influence on the children".&lt;ref&gt;Zimmer (2015), pp. 68-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contemporary developments ==
[[File:EmmaGoldmanQuote2000.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Young anarcha-feminists at an anti-globalization protest quote Emma Goldman]]
An important aspect of anarcha-feminism is its opposition to traditional concepts of family, education and gender roles.&lt;ref&gt;[[Emma Goldman]], "Marriage and Love", in Alix Kates Shulman (ed.), ''Red Emma Speaks: An Emma Goldman Reader'', Schocken Books, N.Y., 1982, pp. 204-13.&lt;/ref&gt; The institution of marriage is one of the most widely opposed.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, "Marriage and Love".&lt;/ref&gt; De Cleyre argued that marriage stifled individual growth&lt;ref&gt;Voltairine de Cleyre, [http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/bright/cleyre/theywhomarry.html They Who Marry Do Ill] (1907)&lt;/ref&gt; and Goldman argued that it "is primarily an economic arrangement... [woman] pays for it with her name, her privacy, her self-respect, her very life".&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, "Marriage and Love", ''Red Emma Speaks'', p. 205&lt;/ref&gt; Anarcha-feminists have also argued for non-hierarchical family and educational structures and had a prominent role in the creation of the [[Modern School (United States)|Modern School]] in [[New York City]], based on the ideas of [[Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Avrich|Avrich, Paul]], ''[[The Modern School Movement: Anarchism and Education in the United States]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Fine Art of Labeling: The Convergence of Anarchism, Feminism, and Bisexuality", by Lucy Friedland and Liz Highleyman, is a piece in ''[[Bi Any Other Name: Bisexual People Speak Out]]'' (1991), an [[anthology]] edited by [[Loraine Hutchins]] and [[Lani Ka'ahumanu]] which is one of the seminal books&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/bisex_movements,2.html Bisexual Movements] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814044505/http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/bisex_movements%2C2.html |date=2007-08-14 }} [[glbtq.com]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biresource.org/pamphlets/history.html A Brief History of the Bisexual Movement by Liz A.

Contemporary anarcha-feminism has been noted for its heavy influence on [[ecofeminism]]: "Ecofeminists rightly note that except for anarcha-feminist, no feminist perspective has recognized the importance of healing the nature/culture division".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tuana|first=Nancy|title=Feminism And Philosophy: Essential Readings In Theory, Reinterpretation, And Application|year=1994|publisher=Westview Press|location=Boulder (Colo.)|isbn=978-0-8133-2213-1|editor=Tong, Rosemarie|page=328}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary anarcha-feminist writers/theorists include [[Maria Mies]], [[Peggy Kornegger]], [[L. Susan Brown]], the [[ecofeminism|eco-feminist]] [[Starhawk]] and the [[Post-left anarchy|post-left anarchist]] and [[Anarcho-primitivism|anarcho-primitivist]] Lilith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theanarchistlibrary.org/authors/Lilith.html |title=Lilith texts at The Anarchist Library |publisher=The Anarchist Library |date= |accessdate=2012-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past decades, two films have been produced about anarcha-feminism. ''[[Libertarias]]'' is a historical drama made in 1996 about the Spanish anarcha-feminist organization ''Mujeres Libres''. In 2010, the Argentinian film ''Ni dios, ni patrón, ni marido'' was released which is centered on the story of anarcha-feminist [[Virginia Bolten]] and her publishing of the newspaper ''{{lang|es|La Voz de la Mujer}}'' (''{{lang-en|The Woman's Voice}}'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinenacional.com/peliculas/index.php?pelicula=7005 |title="Ni Dios, Ni Patrón, Ni Marido" (2009) by Laura Mañá |publisher=Cinenacional.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLh8AX0tcY0 |title=Ni Dios, Ni Patron, Ni Marido - Trailer |publisher=Youtube.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "autonomous" as applied to stained glass refers to works which are designed independent of architecture. Autonomous works are not designed to glaze windows. The term "stained glass" commonly precedes "window" and is thus linked to architecture both linguistically and conceptually. The autonomous work is more like a painting than a stained glass window, and is a non-traditional use of the medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sowers|first=Robert|title=Stained Glass: An Architectural Art|year=1965|publisher=Universe Books, Inc.|location=New York|page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; One critic somewhat pejoratively calls non-architectural stained glass "uncommissioned panels."&lt;ref name=Sowers&gt;{{cite book|last=Sowers|first=Robert|title=The Language of Stained Glass|year=1981|publisher=Timber Press|location=Forest Grove, Oregon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another traditionalist claims: "Stained glass can never be really satisfactory when considered as a bibelot to be hung up in the window or when sold in galleries like paintings for room decoration."&lt;ref&gt;John Baker in Trevor Dannatt, ed., ''Architects’ Yearbook 6'', Elek Books, Ltd., London, 1955&lt;/ref&gt;

From the Renaissance ([[Uccello]], [[Ghiberti]], [[Ghirlandaio]]), through the 18th and 19th centuries ([[Sir Joshua Reynolds]], [[Delacroix]]), into the 20th century ([[Rouault]], [[Chagall]]), artists have made windows in the style of their paintings. These windows look like paintings but they are ''windows'' that respond, to a greater or lesser degree, to the form, purpose, and mood of a building. Over time there have been scattered examples of works painted on small sheets of glass, sometimes assembled with lead, which were not designed to fill window openings.&lt;ref name=Sowers /&gt; In Germany during the second half of the 20th century, studios began fabricating small panels for display in galleries and museums that were either similar in style to, or details of larger windows. Such panels are generally extensions of an architecturally accommodative aesthetic quite different from the "personal and introspective" approach of much contemporary painting and autonomous stained glass.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kehlmann, "Glass as a Free Art Form," Neues Glas, January, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Theo van Doesburg]], [[Piet Mondrian]], [[Josef Albers]] and a handful of other early 20th-century artists did on occasion make autonomous stained glass works. Not until the early 1970s in the United States, however, did a group of stained glass artists devote themselves, in some instances exclusively, to such work.&lt;ref name=Sowers /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;6.	Casey Lewis, "Robert Kehlmann: Richmond Art Center, Richmond California," ''Glass Art'', Vol.4, No. 1976&lt;/ref&gt; Like painters, they used the medium in expressive, personal ways, designing and executing their own work rather than having them made by outside studios as is common with architectural stained glass windows. The first generation of American artists working autonomously with stained glass was documented in the landmark 1978 exhibition "New Stained Glass" at New York’s [[Museum of Contemporary Crafts]].&lt;ref&gt;"New Stained Glass," Museum of Contemporary Crafts, New York, 1978 (catalog)&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently others, worldwide, have devoted themselves to making autonomous stained glass.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kehlmann, "Stained Glass as a Non-Architectural Art," ''Glass Art Magazine'', December, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the book ''Twentieth Century Stained Glass: A New Definition'', art critic [[Robert Kehlmann]] points out that making a stained glass panel and designing a window are two different disciplines. Autonomous glass artists generally fabricate their own work, very often experimenting with materials, technique, and the uses of light. They freely "address a wide range of ideas and feelings without concern for the form and mood of a building." The size, shape and imagery of an autonomous stained glass work is "dictated solely by the nature of materials and personal aesthetics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kehlmann|first=Robert|title=Twentieth Century Stained Glass: A New Definition|year=1992|publisher=Kyoto Shoin Ltd.|location=Japan|page=242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Billy the Kid''' (born '''Henry McCarty''' September 17 or November 23, 1859{{snd}}July 14, 1881, [[Pseudonym|also known as]] '''William H. Bonney''') was an [[United States|American]] [[American Old West|Old West]] outlaw and [[gunfighter]] who killed eight men before he was shot and killed at age 21.{{sfn|Rasch|1995|pp=23–35}}{{sfn|Wallis|2007|pp=244–245}} He took part in New Mexico's [[Lincoln County War]], during which he allegedly took part in three murders.

McCarty was orphaned at age 13. The owner of a boarding house gave him a room in exchange for work. His first arrest was for stealing food at age 16 in late 1875. Ten days later, he robbed a Chinese laundry and was arrested, but he escaped only two days later. He tried to stay with his stepfather, and then fled from [[New Mexico Territory]] into neighboring [[Arizona Territory]], making him both an outlaw and a federal fugitive. In 1877, McCarty began to refer to himself as "William H. Bonney".{{sfn|Wallis|2007|p=144}}

After murdering a blacksmith during an altercation in August 1877, Bonney became a wanted man in Arizona Territory and returned to New Mexico, where he joined a group of [[Cattle raiding|cattle rustlers]]. He became a well-known figure in the region when he joined the [[Lincoln County Regulators|Regulators]] and took part in the Lincoln County War. In April 1878, the Regulators killed three men, including Lincoln County Sheriff [[William&amp;nbsp;J. Brady]] and one of his deputies. Bonney and two other Regulators were later charged with killing all three men.

Bonney's notoriety grew in December 1880 when the ''Las Vegas Gazette'' in [[Las Vegas, New Mexico]], and ''[[The Sun (New York City)|The Sun]]'' in New York City carried stories about his crimes.{{sfn|Utley|1989|pp=145–146}} Sheriff [[Pat Garrett]] captured Bonney later that month. In April 1881, Bonney was tried and convicted of the murder of Brady, and was sentenced to hang in May of that year. He escaped from jail on April 28, 1881, killing two sheriff's deputies in the process and evading capture for more than two months. Garrett shot and killed Bonney{{mdash}}aged 21{{mdash}}in [[Fort Sumner, New Mexico|Fort Sumner]] on July 14, 1881. During the following decades, legends that Bonney had survived that night grew, and a number of men claimed to be him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/billy-the-kid-survived-hico-texas |title = The Old Man Who Claimed to Be Billy the Kid |date = March 30, 2017 |work = Atlas Obscura |access-date = July 19, 2017 |language = en |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170708134218/http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/billy-the-kid-survived-hico-texas |archivedate = July 8, 2017 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
=== Early life ===

Henry McCarty was born to Catherine ({{nee|Devine}}) McCarty in [[New York City]].  While his birth year has been confirmed to be 1859, the exact date of his birth has been disputed as either September 17 or November 23 of that year.  A letter from an official of [[St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church (Manhattan)|Saint Peters's Church]] in [[Manhattan]] states it is in possession of records showing McCarty was baptized in that church on September 28, 1859.{{efn|Letter from Rev. James B. Roberts, Church of St. Peter, New York City, to Jack DeMattos, March 24, 1979.{{sfn|DeMattos|1980}}}}{{sfn|Nolan|2009|pp=1–6}}{{sfn|Rasch|Mullin|1953|pp=1–5}}{{sfn|Rasch|1954|pp=6–11}} Census records indicate his younger brother, Joseph McCarty, was born in 1863.{{sfn|Nolan|1998|pp=15, 29}}

Following the death of her husband Patrick, Catherine McCarty and her sons moved to [[Indianapolis]], Indiana, where she met William Henry Harrison Antrim. The McCarty family moved with Antrim to [[Wichita, Kansas]], in 1870.{{sfn|Wallis|2007|p=15}} After moving again a few years later, Catherine married Antrim on March 1, 1873, at the First Presbyterian Church in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], New Mexico Territory; McCarty and his brother Joseph were witnesses to the ceremony.{{sfn|Nolan|1998|pp=17–19}}{{sfn|Nolan|2009|p=7}} Shortly afterward, the family moved from Santa Fe to [[Silver City, New Mexico]], and Joseph McCarty began using the name Joseph Antrim.{{sfn|Nolan|1998|pp=15, 29}} Catherine McCarty died of [[tuberculosis]] on September 16, 1874.{{sfn|Nolan|2009|p=8}}

=== First crimes ===

McCarty was 13 years old when his mother died. Sarah Brown, the owner of a [[boarding house]], gave him [[room and board]] in exchange for work. On September 16, 1875, McCarty was caught stealing food.&lt;ref name=billyhistorynet&gt;{{cite web |title = Billy The Kid: Facts, information and articles about Billy The Kid, famous outlaw, and a prominent figure from the Wild West |publisher = HistoryNet.com |url = http://www.historynet.com/billy-the-kid |accessdate = January 4, 2016 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160103175548/http://www.historynet.com/billy-the-kid |archivedate = January 3, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Grant County Herald'' (Silver City, New Mexico), September 26, 1875.&lt;/ref&gt; Ten days later, McCarty and George Schaefer robbed a [[Chinese laundry]], stealing clothing and two pistols. McCarty was charged with theft and was jailed. He escaped two days later and became a fugitive,&lt;ref name=billyhistorynet /&gt; as reported in the ''Silver City Herald'' the next day, the first story published about him. McCarty located his stepfather and stayed with him until Antrim threw him out; McCarty stole clothing and guns from him. It was the last time the two saw each other.{{sfn|Wallis|2007|pp=94–95}}

[[File:Rancher Henry C Hooker retouched cropped.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Henry Hooker]], one-time employer of Billy the Kid, at his [[Sierra Bonita Ranch]] in southeast Arizona]]

After leaving Antrim, McCarty traveled to southeastern [[Arizona Territory]], where he worked as a ranch hand and gambled his wages in nearby gaming houses.{{sfn|Wallis|2007|p=103}} In 1876, he was hired as a ranch hand by well-known rancher [[Henry Hooker]].&lt;ref name="nmdotorg"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://newmexicohistory.org/people/billy-the-kid |title = Billy the Kid |publisher = State of New Mexico |accessdate = January 6, 2016 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160126043335/http://newmexicohistory.org/people/billy-the-kid |archivedate = January 26, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Utley|1989|pp=10–11}} During this time, McCarty became acquainted with John R. Mackie, a Scottish-born criminal and former [[United States Cavalry|U.S. Cavalry]] private who, following his discharge, remained near the U.S. Army post at [[Fort Grant, Arizona|Camp Grant]]. The two men soon began stealing horses from local soldiers.{{sfn|Wallis|2007|p=107}}{{sfn|Utley|1989|pp=11–12}} McCarty became known as "Kid Antrim" because of his youth, slight build, clean-shaven appearance, and personality.{{sfn|Wallis|2007|pp=110–111}}{{sfn|Utley|1989|pp=16}}

On August 17, 1877, McCarty was at a saloon in the village of [[Bonita, Arizona|Bonita]] when he got into an argument with Francis P. "Windy" Cahill, a blacksmith who reportedly had bullied McCarty and on more than one occasion, called McCarty a "[[pimp]]". McCarty in turn called Cahill a "[[Bitch_(slang)#Son_of_a_bitch|son of a bitch]]," whereupon Cahill threw McCarty to the floor and the two struggled for McCarty's revolver. McCarty shot and mortally wounded Cahill. A witness said, "[Billy] had no choice; he had to use his equalizer." Cahill died the following day.&lt;ref name="cahill"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Radbourne |first1= Allan |last2= Rasch |first2= Philip J. |date= August 1985 |title= The Story of 'Windy' Cahill |journal= Real West |issue= 204 |pages= 22–27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/billy-the-kid-kills-his-first-man |title= This Date in History – August 17, 1877 – Billy the Kid kills his first man |publisher= History Channel |accessdate= January 17, 2016 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160315024623/http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/billy-the-kid-kills-his-first-man |archivedate= March 15, 2016 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  McCarty fled but returned a few days later and was apprehended by Miles Wood, the local [[justice of the peace]]. McCarty was detained and held in the Camp Grant guardhouse but escaped before law enforcement could arrive.&lt;ref name="NMHistorg"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://newmexicohistory.org/people/billy-the-kid |title= Billy the Kid |publisher= New Mexico  Office of the State Historian |accessdate= February 10, 2016 |first= William H. |last= Wroth |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160126043335/http://newmexicohistory.org/people/billy-the-kid |archivedate= January 26, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

McCarty stole a horse and fled Arizona Territory for [[New Mexico Territory]],{{sfn|Wallis|2007|p=119}} but [[Apache]]s took the horse from him, leaving him to walk many miles to the nearest settlement. At [[Fort Stanton]] in the Pecos Valley,{{sfn|Nolan|1998|p=77}} McCarty—starving and near death—went to the home of friend and [[Seven Rivers Warriors]] gang member John Jones, whose mother Barbara nursed McCarty back to health.&lt;ref name="TWJones"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.truewestmagazine.com/maam-jones/ |title = Ma'am Jones A stitch in time |publisher = True West Magazine |date = March 19, 2013 |accessdate = February 10, 2016 |first = Chad |last = Hays |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151222225253/http://www.truewestmagazine.com/maam-jones/ |archivedate = December 22, 2015 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Wallis|2007|p=144}} After regaining his health, McCarty went to Apache Tejo, a former army post, where he joined a band of rustlers who raided herds owned by cattle magnate [[John Chisum]] in [[Lincoln County, New Mexico|Lincoln County]]. After McCarty was spotted in Silver City, his involvement with the gang was mentioned in a local newspaper.{{sfn|Wallis|2007|pp=123–131}}

At some point in 1877, McCarty began to refer to himself as "William H. Bonney".{{sfn|Wallis|2007|p=144}}

==== Prelude ====

After returning to New Mexico, Bonney worked for English businessman and rancher [[John Henry Tunstall]] (1853–1878), as a cowboy near the Rio Felix—a tributary of the [[Rio Grande]]—in [[Lincoln County, New Mexico|Lincoln County]]. Tunstall and his business partner and lawyer [[Alexander McSween]] were opponents of an alliance formed by Irish-American businessmen [[Lawrence Murphy]], [[James Dolan (Lincoln County War)|James Dolan]], and John Riley. The three men had wielded an economic and political hold over Lincoln County since the early 1870s, due in part to their ownership of a beef contract with nearby [[Fort Stanton]] and a well-patronized dry goods store in [[Lincoln, New Mexico|Lincoln]].

In February 1878, McSween owed $8,000 to Dolan, who obtained a court order and asked Lincoln County Sheriff [[William J. Brady]] to [[Attachment (law)|attach]] nearly $40,000 worth of Tunstall's property and livestock. Tunstall put Bonney in charge of nine prime horses and told him to relocate them to his ranch for safekeeping. Meanwhile, Sheriff Brady assembled a large posse to seize Tunstall's cattle.{{sfn|Nolan|2009|pp=188–190}}&lt;ref name=tunstallfamily /&gt;

On February 18, 1878, Tunstall learned of the posse's presence on his land and rode out to intervene. During the encounter, one member of the posse shot Tunstall in the chest, knocking him off his horse. Another posse member took Tunstall's gun and killed him with a shot to the back of his head.&lt;ref name="tunstallfamily"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.truewestmagazine.com/the-tunstalls-return/ |title = The Tunstalls Return – John Tunstall's kin traveled from England to fathom death in Lincoln. |publisher = True West Magazine |date = September 25, 2010 |accessdate = February 10, 2016 |last = Boardman |first = Mark |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160216031421/http://www.truewestmagazine.com/the-tunstalls-return/ |archivedate = February 16, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Utley|1989|p=46}}  Tunstall's murder ignited the conflict between the two factions that became known as the [[Lincoln County War]].&lt;ref name=tunstallfamily /&gt;{{sfn|Nolan|2009|pp=23–55}}

==== Build-up ====

After Tunstall was killed, Bonney and [[Richard M.

==== Battle of Lincoln (1878) ====
{{Main|Battle of Lincoln (1878)}}

On the night of Sunday, July 14, McSween and the Regulators—now a group of fifty or sixty men—went to Lincoln and stationed themselves in the town among several buildings.{{sfn|Jacobsen|1994|p=173}} At the McSween residence were Bonney, Florencio Chavez, [[Jose Chavez y Chavez]], Jim French, Harvey Morris, [[Tom O'Folliard]], and [[Yginio Salazar]], among others. Another group led by Marin Chavez and [[Doc Scurlock]] positioned themselves on the roof of a saloon. [[Henry Newton Brown]], Dick Smith and [[George Coe (Lincoln County War)|George Coe]] defended a nearby adobe bunkhouse.{{sfn|Nolan|1992|pp=312–313}}{{sfn|Utley|1987|p=87}}

On Tuesday, July 16, the newly appointed sheriff [[George Peppin]] sent sharpshooters to kill the McSween defenders at the saloon. Peppin's men retreated when one of the snipers, Charles Crawford, was killed by Fernando Herrera. Peppin then sent a request for assistance to Colonel [[Nathan Dudley]], commandant of nearby [[Fort Stanton]]. In a reply to Peppin, Dudley refused to intervene but later arrived in Lincoln with troops, turning the battle in favor of the Murphy-Dolan faction.{{sfn|Nolan|1992|p=513}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://newmexicohistory.org/people/billy-the-kid|title=New Mexico Office of the State Historian {{!}} people|website=newmexicohistory.org|language=en|access-date=July 19, 2017| deadurl= no| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170629050035/http://newmexicohistory.org/people/billy-the-kid| archivedate= June 29, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A shooting war broke out on Friday, July 19. McSween's supporters gathered inside his house; when Buck Powell and Deputy Sheriff Jack Long set fire to the building, the occupants began shooting. Bonney and the other men fled the building when all rooms but one were burning. During the confusion, Alexander McSween was shot and killed by Robert W. Beckwith, who was then shot and killed by Bonney.{{sfn|Nolan|1992|pp=322–331}}{{sfn|Utley|1987|pp=96–111}}

=== Outlaw ===

Bonney and three other survivors of the Battle of Lincoln were near the Mescalero Indian Agency when the agency bookkeeper, Morris Bernstein, was murdered on August 5, 1878. All four were indicted for the murder, despite conflicting evidence that Bernstein had been killed by Constable Atanacio Martinez. All of these indictments except Bonney's were later quashed.{{sfn|Utley|1989|pp=104–105, 107, 110}}{{sfn|Nolan|2009|pp=339–340, 342, 445, 514}}

[[File:Gov Lew Wallace in 1893 cropped lightened.jpg|upright=0.8|thumb|left|New Mexico Territorial Governor [[Lew Wallace]] in 1893]]

On October 5, 1878, [[United States Marshal Service|U.S. Marshal]] John Sherman informed newly appointed Territorial Governor and former Army general [[Lew Wallace]] that he held warrants for several men, including "William H. Antrim, alias Kid, alias Bonny [sic]" but was unable to execute them "owing to the disturbed condition of affairs in that county, resulting from the acts of a desperate class of men".{{sfn|Utley|1987|p=120}} Wallace issued an amnesty proclamation on November 13, 1878, which pardoned anyone involved in the Lincoln County War since Tunstall's murder. It specifically excluded persons who had been convicted of or indicted for a crime, and therefore excluded Bonney.{{sfn|Nolan|2009|pp=315, 515}}{{sfn|Utley|1987|pp=122–123, 126–128, 141, 150, 154, 156–158}}

On February 18, 1879, Bonney and friend [[Tom O'Folliard]] were in Lincoln and watched as attorney Huston Chapman was shot and his corpse set on fire. According to eyewitnesses, the pair were innocent bystanders forced at gunpoint by [[Jesse Evans]] to witness the murder.{{sfn|Utley|1987|pp=132–136, 139, 141, 143–144}}{{sfn|Nolan|1992|pp=375–376, 378, 516–517}}

Bonney wrote to Governor Wallace on March 13, 1879, with an offer to provide information on the Chapman murder in exchange for amnesty. On March 15, Governor Wallace replied, agreeing to a secret meeting to discuss the situation. Bonney met with Wallace in Lincoln on March 17, 1879. During the meeting and in subsequent correspondence, Wallace promised Bonney protection from his enemies and clemency if he would offer his testimony to a [[grand jury]].{{efn|For years Wallace denied that he had agreed to the bargain with Bonney; however, in a newspaper article published in 1902, Wallace changed his story and said he had promised Bonney a pardon in change for the testimony.{{sfn|Cooper|2017|pages=556–61}} }} On March 20, Wallace wrote to Bonney, "to remove all suspicion of understanding, I think it better to put the arresting party in charge of Sheriff Kimbrell [sic] who shall be instructed to see that no violence is used".{{efn|Letter from Governor Wallace to W.H. Bonney, March 20, 1879.{{sfn| Cooper |2017|pages=563–65}} }} Bonney responded on the same day, agreeing to testify and confirming Wallace's proposal for his arrest and detention in a local jail to assure his safety.{{sfn|Cooper| p. 565}}{{sfn|Boomhower|2005|p=103}} On March 21, Bonney let himself be captured by a posse led by Sheriff George Kimball of Lincoln County.

Still in custody several weeks later, Bonney began to suspect Wallace had used subterfuge and would never grant him amnesty. Bonney escaped from the Lincoln County jail on June 17, 1879.{{sfn|Utley|1989|pp=111–125}}

Bonney avoided further violence until January 10, 1880, when he shot and killed Joe Grant, a newcomer to the area, at Hargrove's Saloon in [[Fort Sumner, New Mexico]].&lt;ref name="truewestmag"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.truewestmagazine.com/billy-the-kid-vs-joe-grant/ |title = The Tale of the Empty Chamber Billy the Kid vs Joe Grant |publisher = True West Magazine |date = May 2, 2007 |accessdate = January 10, 2016 |first = Bob Boze |last = Bell |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160216031739/http://www.truewestmagazine.com/billy-the-kid-vs-joe-grant/ |archivedate = February 16, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Santa Fe Weekly New Mexican'' reported, "Billy Bonney, more extensively known as 'the Kid,' shot and killed Joe Grant. The origin of the difficulty was not learned."&lt;ref&gt;''Santa Fe Weekly New Mexican'', January 17, 1880.&lt;/ref&gt; According to other contemporary sources, Bonney had been warned Grant intended to kill him. He walked up to Grant, told him he admired his revolver, and asked to examine it. Grant handed it over. Before returning the pistol, which Bonney noticed contained only three cartridges, he positioned the cylinder so the next hammer fall would land on an empty chamber. Grant suddenly pointed his pistol at Bonney's face and pulled the trigger. When it failed to fire, Bonney drew his own weapon and shot Grant in the head. A reporter for the ''Las Vegas Optic'' quoted Bonney as saying the encounter "was a game of two and I got there first".{{sfn|Utley|1989|pp=131–133, 145, 203, 249–250}}{{sfn|Nolan|2009|pp=397, 518, 572}}

In 1880 Bonney formed a friendship with a rancher named Jim Greathouse, who later introduced him to [[Dave Rudabaugh]]. On November 29, 1880, Bonney, Rudabaugh and [[Billy Wilson (outlaw)|Billy Wilson]] ran from a posse led by sheriff's deputy James Carlyle. Cornered at Greathouse's ranch, Bonney told the posse they were holding Greathouse as a hostage. Carlyle offered to exchange places with Greathouse, and Bonney accepted the offer. Carlyle later attempted to escape by jumping through a window but he was shot three times and killed. The shoot-out ended in a standoff;  the posse withdrew and Bonney, Rudabaugh, and Wilson rode away.{{sfn|Utley|1989|pp=143–146, 179, 204}}{{sfn|Nolan|1992|pp=398–401}}

A few weeks after the Greathouse incident, Bonney, Rudabaugh, Wilson, [[Charlie Bowdre]], [[Tom Pickett (outlaw)|Tom Pickett]], and O'Folliard rode into Fort Sumner. Unknown to Bonney and his companions, a posse led by Pat Garrett was waiting for them. The posse opened fire, killing O'Folliard; the rest of the outlaws escaped unharmed.{{sfn|Metz|1974|pp=74–75}}{{sfn|Utley|1989|pp=155–157, 256–257}}

=== Capture and escape ===
[[File:Charlie bowdre lighting corrected.jpg|upright=0.8|thumb|[[Charlie Bowdre]], {{circa|1880}}]]

On December 13, 1880, Governor Wallace posted a $500 bounty for Bonney's capture.{{sfn|Utley|1989|p=147}} Pat Garrett continued his search for Bonney; on December 23, following the siege in which Bowdre was killed, Garrett and his posse captured Bonney along with Pickett, Rudabaugh and Wilson at Stinking Springs. The prisoners, including Bonney, were shackled and taken to Fort Sumner, then later to [[Las Vegas, New Mexico]]. When they arrived on December 26, they were met by crowds of curious onlookers. The following day, an armed mob gathered at the train depot before the prisoners, who were already on board the train with Garrett, departed for Santa Fe.{{sfn|Wallis|2007|p=240}} Deputy Sheriff Romero, backed by the angry group of men, demanded custody of Dave Rudabaugh, who had killed a local jailer. Garrett refused to surrender the prisoner, and a tense confrontation ensued until he agreed to let the sheriff and two other men accompany the party to Santa Fe, where they would petition the governor to release Rudabaugh to them.{{sfn|Wallis|2007|pp=126–127}} In a later interview with a reporter, Bonney said he was unafraid during the incident, saying, "if I only had my Winchester I'd lick the whole crowd".{{sfn|Metz|1974|pp=76–85}}{{sfn|Utley|1989|pp=157–166}} The ''Las Vegas Gazette'' ran a story from a jailhouse interview following Bonney's capture; when the reporter said Bonney appeared relaxed, he replied, "What's the use of looking on the gloomy side of everything?

After arriving in Santa Fe, Bonney, seeking clemency, sent Governor Wallace four letters over the next three months. Wallace refused to intervene,{{sfn|Wallis|2007|pp=240–241}} and Bonney went to trial in April 1881 in [[Mesilla, New Mexico]].{{sfn|Wallis|2007|p=242}} Following two days of testimony, Bonney was found guilty of Sheriff Brady's murder; it was the only conviction secured against any of the combatants in the Lincoln County War. On April 13, Judge Warren Bristol sentenced Bonney to [[hanging|hang]], with his execution scheduled for May 13, 1881.{{sfn|Wallis|2007|p=242}} According to legend, upon sentencing, the judge told Bonney he was going to hang until he was "dead, dead, dead"; Bonney's response was, "you can go to hell, hell, hell".&lt;ref name="historydotcom"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/billy-the-kid-is-shot-to-death |title = 1881 Billy the Kid is shot to death |work = History.com |accessdate = February 10, 2016 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160215230740/http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/billy-the-kid-is-shot-to-death |archivedate = February 15, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the historical record, he did not speak after the reading of his sentence.&lt;ref name="TWMagBtKlegends"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.truewestmagazine.com/what-if-everything-we-know-about-billy-the-kid-is-wrong/ |title = "What if everything we know about Billy the Kid is wrong?" – Special Report |work = True West Magazine |date = April 28, 2015 |accessdate = February 12, 2016 |first = Frederick |last = Nolan |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160216044410/http://www.truewestmagazine.com/what-if-everything-we-know-about-billy-the-kid-is-wrong/ |archivedate = February 16, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his sentencing, Bonney was moved to Lincoln, where he was held under guard on the top floor of the town courthouse. On the evening of April 28, 1881, while Garrett was in [[White Oaks, New Mexico|White Oaks]] collecting taxes, Deputy [[Bob Olinger]] took five other prisoners across the street for a meal, leaving James Bell, another deputy, alone with Bonney at the jail. Bonney asked to be taken outside to use the [[outhouse]] behind the courthouse; on their return to the jail, Bonney—who was walking ahead of Bell up the stairs to his cell—hid around a blind corner, slipped out of his handcuffs, and beat Bell with the loose end of the cuffs. During the ensuing scuffle, Bonney grabbed Bell's revolver and fatally shot him in the back as Bell tried to get away.{{sfn|Utley|1989|p=181}}

[[File:Bob Ollinger death marker.JPG|thumb|Marker noting the site where Deputy Olinger (spelled here as "Ollinger") was killed by Bonney]]

Bonney, with his legs still shackled, broke into Garrett's office and took a loaded shotgun left behind by Olinger. Bonney waited at the upstairs window for Olinger to respond to the gunshot that killed Bell and called out to him, "Look up, old boy, and see what you get". When Olinger looked up, Bonney shot and killed him.{{sfn|Utley|1989|p=181}}{{sfn|Wallis|2007|pp=243–244}} After about an hour, Bonney freed himself from the leg irons with an axe.{{sfn|Jacobsen|1994|pp=232}} He obtained a horse and rode out of town; according to some stories he was singing as he left Lincoln.{{sfn|Wallis|2007|pp=243–244}}

=== Recapture and death ===
While Bonney was on the run, Governor Wallace placed a new $500 bounty on the fugitive's head.{{sfn|Utley|1989|p=188}}&lt;ref name="TWbounty"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.truewestmagazine.com/the-holy-grail-for-sale/ |title = The Holy Grail for Sale – The Billy the Kid tintype is on the auction block, and it might just clear half a million |work = True West Magazine |date = May 24, 2011 |accessdate = February 10, 2016 |last = Boardman |first = Mark |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160305011909/http://www.truewestmagazine.com/the-holy-grail-for-sale/ |archivedate = March 5, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.abqjournal.com/311743/is-this-the-kid.html |title = Is this Billy the Kid? |work = Albuquerque Journal – Las Cruces Bureau |date = December 1, 2013 |accessdate = February 6, 2016 |first = Lauren |last = Villagran |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161215113858/https://www.abqjournal.com/311743/is-this-the-kid.html |archivedate = December 15, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost three months after his escape, Garrett, responding to rumors Bonney was in the vicinity of Fort Sumner, left Lincoln with two deputies on July 14, 1881, to question resident Pete Maxwell, a friend of Bonney's.{{sfn|Wallis|2007|pp=245–246}} Maxwell, son of land baron [[Lucien Maxwell]], spoke with Garrett the same day for several hours. Around midnight, the pair sat in Maxwell's darkened bedroom when Bonney unexpectedly entered.{{sfn|Wallis|2007|p=247}}

[[File:Pat Garrett2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|Sheriff Pat Garrett, {{circa|1903}}]]

Accounts vary as to the course of events; according to the canonical version, as he entered the room, Bonney failed to recognize Garrett due to the poor lighting. Drawing his revolver and backing away, Bonney asked ''"¿Quién es? ¿Quién es?"'' (Spanish for "Who is it? Who is it?"). Recognizing Bonney's voice, Garrett drew his revolver and fired twice. The first bullet struck Bonney in the chest just above his heart, killing him.{{sfn|Wallis|2007|p=247}}

A few hours after the shooting, a local justice of the peace assembled a coroner's jury of six people. The jury members interviewed Maxwell and Garrett, and Bonney's body and the location of the shooting were examined. The jury certified the body as Bonney's, and according to a local newspaper, the jury foreman said, "It was the Kid's' body that we examined".&lt;ref name="deathcert"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.history.com/news/historian-seeks-death-certificate-to-end-billy-the-kid-rumors |title = Historian Seeks Death Certificate to End Billy the Kid Rumors |work = History.com |date = February 27, 2015 |accessdate = February 10, 2016 |first = Christopher |last = Klein |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304060901/http://www.history.com/news/historian-seeks-death-certificate-to-end-billy-the-kid-rumors |archivedate = March 4, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bonney was given a wake by candlelight; he was buried the next day and his grave was denoted with a wooden marker.&lt;ref name="SantaFeExaminer"&gt;{{citation |title = Ft.

Five days after Bonney's killing, Garrett traveled to Santa Fe, New Mexico, to collect the $500 reward offered by Governor Lew Wallace for his capture, dead or alive. William G. Ritch, the acting New Mexico governor, refused to pay the reward.&lt;ref name=DNM&gt;{{Citation |title = (no title) |newspaper = Santa Fe Daily New Mexican |page = 4 |date = July 21, 1881 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next few weeks, the residents of Las Vegas, Mesilla, Santa Fe, White Oaks, and other New Mexico cities raised over $7,000 bounty reward money for Garrett. A year and four days after Bonney's death, the New Mexico territorial legislature passed a special act to grant Garrett the $500 bounty reward promised by Governor Wallace.&lt;ref name=ACT&gt;{{Cite court |title = Act For the Relief of Pat Garrett |court = New Mexico Territorial Legislature |pages = 1 |date = July 18, 1882 |accessdate = January 30, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because people had begun to claim Garrett unfairly ambushed Bonney, Garrett felt the need to tell his side of the story and called upon his friend, journalist [[Marshall Ashmun Upson|Marshall Upson]], to [[ghostwrite]] a book for him.{{sfn|Utley|1989|pp=198–199}} The book, ''[[The Authentic Life of Billy, the Kid]]'',{{efn|The full title of the Garrett-Upson book was ''The Authentic Life of Billy, the Kid, the Noted Desperado of the Southwest, Whose Deeds of Daring and Blood Made His Name a Terror in New Mexico, Arizona and Northern Mexico.

Although only a few copies sold following its release, it eventually became a reference for later historians who wrote about Bonney's life.{{sfn|Utley|1989|pp=198–199}}

== Rumors of survival ==

Over time, legends claiming that Bonney was not killed, and that Garrett staged the incident and death out of friendship so Bonney could evade the law, formed and grew.{{sfn|Wallis|2007|p=xiv}} During the next fifty years, a number of men claimed they were Billy the Kid. Most of these claims were easily disproven but two have remained topics of discussion and debate.

In 1948, a central Texas man Ollie P. Roberts—nicknamed [[Brushy Bill]]—began claiming he was Billy the Kid and went before New Mexico Governor Thomas Mabry seeking a pardon.

=== Dedrick ferrotype ===
[[File:Billy the Kid Ferrotype.jpg|thumb|Unretouched original ferrotype of Bonney, {{circa|1880}}]]

One of the few remaining artifacts of Bonney's life is an iconic {{convert|2|x|3|in|cm|adj=on|abbr=off|sp=us}} [[tintype|ferrotype]] photograph of Bonney by an unknown portrait photographer in late 1879 or early 1880. The image shows Bonney wearing a vest over a sweater, a slouch cowboy hat, and a bandanna, while holding an 1873 Winchester rifle with its butt resting on the floor. For years, this was the only photograph scholars and historians agreed showed Bonney.&lt;ref name="TWbounty" /&gt; The ferrotype survived because Bonney's friend Dan Dedrick kept it after the outlaw's death. It was passed down through Dedrick's family, and was copied several times, appearing in numerous publications during the 20th century. In June 2011, the original plate was bought at auction for $2.3 million by businessman [[Bill Koch (businessman)|William Koch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Tripp |first1 = Leslie |title = Billy the Kid photograph fetches $2.3 million at auction |url = http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/06/26/colorado.billy.the.kid.photo/index.html |publisher = CNN |accessdate = July 4, 2015 |date = June 26, 2011 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150706031600/http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/06/26/colorado.billy.the.kid.photo/index.html |archivedate = July 6, 2015 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCphoto"&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-13919013 |title = Billy the Kid portrait fetches $2.3m at Denver auction |publisher = BBC News US &amp; Canada |date = June 26, 2011 |accessdate = January 26, 2016 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160229211130/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-13919013 |archivedate = February 29, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The image shows Bonney wearing his holstered Colt revolver on his left side. This led historians to believe he was left-handed, but they did not take into account that the ferrotype process produces reversed images.&lt;ref name="left hand"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/jun/27/billy-the-kid-photograph-sold |title = Billy the Kid photograph sold at auction in Colorado for $2.3m |work = The Guardian |date = June 26, 2011 |accessdate = December 28, 2015 |first = Jo |last = Adetunji |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160305042431/http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/jun/27/billy-the-kid-photograph-sold |archivedate = March 5, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954, western historians James D.

=== &lt;span id="croquet"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Croquet tintype ===

A 4"x 6" ferrotype purchased at a memorabilia shop in [[Fresno, California]] in 2010 has been claimed to show Bonney and members of the Regulators playing croquet.  If authentic it is the only known photo of Billy the Kid and the Regulators together and the only image to feature their wives and female companions.

In August 2015, [[Lincoln State Monument]] officials and the [[New Mexico Department of Cultural Affairs]] said that despite the new research, they could not confirm that the image showed Bonney or others from the Lincoln County War era, according to Monument manager Gary Cozzens. A photograph curator at the [[Palace of the Governors]] archives, Daniel Kosharek, said the image is "problematic on a lot of fronts", including the small size of the figures and the lack of resemblance of the background landscape to Lincoln County or the state in general.&lt;ref name="Constable" /&gt; An article{{who|date=May 2018}} in ''[[True West Magazine]]'' said, "no one in our office thinks this photo is of the Kid [and the Regulators]".&lt;ref name=truewestmag2&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.truewestmagazine.com/billy-the-kid-experts-weigh-in-on-the-croquet-photo/ |title = Billy the Kid Experts Weigh in on the Croquet Photo |date = October 14, 2015 |accessdate = February 3, 2016 |work = [[True West Magazine]] |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160301175846/http://www.truewestmagazine.com/billy-the-kid-experts-weigh-in-on-the-croquet-photo |archivedate = March 1, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931, Charles{{nbsp}}W.{{nbsp}}Foor, an unofficial tour guide at Fort Sumner Cemetery, campaigned to raise funds for a permanent marker for the graves of Bonney, O'Folliard, and Bowdre.

The term '''break/fix''' refers to the fee-for-service method of providing [[information technology]] (IT) services to businesses.  Using this method an IT solution provider performs services as needed and bills the customer only for the work done.  The service may include repairs, upgrades or installation of systems, components, peripheral equipment, networking or software.

The alternative to break/fix is '''managed services''', which is a [[service plan]], where the customer pays a fixed amount for services covered in the plan and pays additional amounts for repairs or other work which is not covered in the plan. 

The equivalent practice in the consumer market is that of out-of-warranty appliances, where the customer can pay for repairs as needed (break/fix) or they can buy an [[extended warranty]] (managed services).

'''Advantages:'''

Possible lower cost (at first).

'''Disadvantages:'''

Since problems are only addressed when they arise, maintenance is reactive rather than proactive.  Small problems left unaddressed due to shortsightedness because of cost can balloon to major failures.

Unscrupulous providers are incentivized to use inefficient or malicious means to increase break/fix work and thus increase their revenue.

'''CEEQUAL''' is the international evidence-based sustainability assessment, rating and awards scheme for civil engineering, infrastructure, landscaping and works in public spaces. It was established following work promoted by the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]] (ICE) and operated with a group of 14 industry shareholders. In November 2015 CEEQUAL was acquired by [[Building Research Establishment]] (BRE Global Ltd)  following a recommendation from the CEEQUAL Board; this move represents a shared ambition to bring together two successful sustainability rating schemes – BREEAM and CEEQUAL – to create a single, science-based best practice standard and certification tool for civil engineering and other infrastructure projects in the UK and around the world. From November, CEEQUAL will transfer its business operations to BRE Global, and CEEQUAL will, after this transfer, be delivered by the BREEAM certification team with continued support from the CEEQUAL scheme management team.

The acquisition has been prompted by the industry’s desire for a single sustainability rating scheme that addresses the challenges that Infrastructure clients, professions and contractors currently face in delivering more sustainable and resilient infrastructure. The new scheme will also address the need for integration with building related schemes so that clients with mixed developments can have a single combined rating for their asset. The new single combined scheme will help to deliver enhanced environmental and social benefits for civil engineering works and better economic outcomes that benefit society.

CEEQUAL encourages and promotes the attainment of high economic, environmental and social performance in all forms of civil engineering through identifying and applying best practice. It aims to assist clients, designers and contractors to deliver improved sustainability performance and strategy in a project or contract, during specification, design and construction. The scheme rewards project and contract teams who go beyond the legal, environmental and social minima to achieve distinctive environmental and social performance in their work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ceequal.com/ CEEQUAL Website - Introduction] Retrieved on 2 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Prior to the recent acquisition by BRE, CEEQUAL was developed by a team led by the [[Institution of Civil Engineers|ICE]], with government financial support from the [[DETR]] and [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|DTI]] Partners in Innovation schemes, and from the ICE's Research &amp; Development Enabling Fund. 
The development of CEEQUAL was managed by Crane Environmental Ltd., and received support and participation from relevant government departments and agencies, professional and industry associations, and civil engineering consultants and contractors.

Following industry-wide consultation and trialling, the scheme was launched in September 2003 and the first eight Awards presented at the ICE.

Since then, CEEQUAL has become the [[UK]] industry scheme for assessing environmental and sustainability performance in civil engineering and public realm projects, and is now widely used by major civil engineering clients, designers and contractors. In June 2008 CEEQUAL was recognised by [[HM Government|HM Government's]] report, ''Strategy for Sustainable Construction''  as an initiative helping to 'drive forward' the Government’s design agenda for civil engineering and infrastructure projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ice.org.uk/knowledge/newsdetail_ice.asp?NewsID=959&amp;NewsType=ICE&amp;FacultyID=3 ICE News Website - CEEQUAL gets government backing in new construction strategy]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Retrieved on 2 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The total construction value of all projects assessed or in process of being assessed under CEEQUAL reached the £6 billion mark in autumn 2008. By 2015 the civil engineering value of work that has been or is currently being assessed exceeds £25 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ceequal.com/downloads/CEEQUAL-6bn-Oct08.pdf Press Release - Value of projects assessed under CEEQUAL is approaching £6bn]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Retrieved on 2 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==How CEEQUAL works==

The scheme uses a points-scoring-based assessment, which is applicable to any civil engineering or public realm project. The scheme is made up of 200 questions within the CEEQUAL Manual relating to environmental and social aspects of a project such as the use of water, energy and land, impacts on ecology, landscape, neighbours, archaeology, as well as waste minimisation and management, and community relations and amenity. Awards are made to projects in which the clients, designers and constructors have gone beyond the legal and environmental minima, to achieve distinctive environmental standards of performance.

Project assessments are self-assessments carried out by an Assessor from within any part of a project team, or contracted in, who must have been trained by CEEQUAL. CEEQUAL also appoints a trained Verifier to the project, who is independent of the project team and acts to support the Assessor and provide validation of the completed assessment and subsequent Award.
The first step involves the Assessor and Verifier agreeing which questions are not relevant to the project and should be scoped out. The project is then assessed against the remaining question set. The Assessor completes the assessment by gathering the appropriate supporting evidence and completing a Scoring Spreadsheet. This is then submitted to the Verifier, together with the supporting evidence, for review and approval. Once the Verifier is satisfied with the assessment, the Scoring Spreadsheet is submitted to CEEQUAL for ratification, and a CEEQUAL Award certificate is issued.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aggregain.org.uk/sustainability/examples_of_tools_and_approaches/ceequal/ AggRegain Website - CEEQUAL Step by Step Guide] Retrieved on 2 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several different CEEQUAL Award levels that a project can achieve, depending on the percentage number of points scored against the scoped-out question set. These are:

* more than 25% - Pass
* more than 40% - Good
* more than 60% - Very Good
* more than 75% - Excellent

==Award types==

Five types of award can be applied for:

* Whole Project Award, which is normally applied for jointly by or on behalf of the client, designer and principal contractor(s)
* Client &amp; Design Award
* Design Only Award, applied for by the principal designer(s) only
* Construction Only Award, applied for by the principal contractor(s) only
* Design &amp; Build Award, applied for the designer(s) and constructor(s) of a project.

For larger or long-term projects an Interim (Client &amp; Outline Design) Award is assessed en route to a final Whole Project Award.

==The manual==

The ''CEEQUAL Assessment Manual for Projects'' contains the 200 questions that comprise the CEEQUAL scheme and against which projects are assessed. The Manual also contains background information and references, guidance on scoring and scoping out, and examples of what is considered appropriate evidence. The question set is split into the following 12 topic areas:

* Project management
* Land use
* Landscape
* Ecology and biodiversity
* The historic environment
* Water resources and the water environment
* Energy and carbon
* Material use
* Waste management
* Transport
* Effects on neighbours
* Relations with the local community and other stakeholders

In November 2008, Version 4 of the CEEQUAL Manual was launched. This provided a significant update to previous versions, including new questions specifically targeting carbon emissions and whole-life-cycle carbon analysis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ceequal.com/downloads/CEEQUAL%20Manual%20V4%20launch.pdf Press Release - CEEQUAL is launching new Scheme Manual at CIVILS 2008]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Retrieved on 2 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The CEEQUAL Manual should be read in conjunction with the ''Scheme Description and Process Handbook'', which introduces the process of a CEEQUAL assessment and acts as a 'how to' guide for the Manual.

'''Caracol''' is the name given to a large ancient [[Maya civilization|Maya]] archaeological site, located in what is now the [[Cayo District, Belize|Cayo District]] of  [[Belize]]. It is situated approximately 40 kilometres south of [[Xunantunich]] and the town of [[San Ignacio Cayo]], and 15 kilometers away from the Macal River. It rests on the Vaca Plateau at an elevation of 500 meters above sea-level, in the foothills of the Maya Mountains.&lt;ref name="A. and D. 1987"&gt;Arlen Chase and Diane Chase, 1987 Investigations at the Classic Maya City of Caracol, Belize: 1985-1987. Pre-Columbian Art Research Institute, San Francisco.&lt;/ref&gt; Long thought to be a tertiary center, it is now known that the site was one of the most important regional political centers of the Maya Lowlands during the Classic Period.&lt;ref name="D. and A. 1995" /&gt; Caracol covered approximately 200 square kilometers,&lt;ref name="A. and D. 2009"&gt;Arlen Chase and Diane Chase 2009 Interpreting the Maya “Collapse”: Continued Investigation of Residential Complexes in and near Caracol’s Epicenter: 2009 Field Report of the Caracol Archaeological Project. http://caracol.org/reports/2009.php, accessed November 20, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; covering an area much larger than present-day [[Belize City]] (the largest metropolitan area in the country) and supported more than twice the modern city's population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History: Site Overview |url=http://www.caracol.org/about/history.php |accessdate=7 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110401113645/http://www.caracol.org/about/history.php |archivedate=1 April 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
"Caracol" is a modern name from {{lang-es|caracol}} "[[snail]], shell", but more generally meaning spiral- or [[volute]]-shaped&amp;mdash; apparently on account of the winding access road that led to the site.&lt;ref name="A. and D. 1987" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kelly (1996, p.82)&lt;/ref&gt;  Local tour guides say that the nickname "Caracol" originates from the large population of snails present on the site. Researchers would say to go to "that one place with all the snails", and this eventually developed into just referring to it as "Caracol". When visiting the site you will see that snails are quite literally everywhere. Its ancient name has been reconstructed from the Emblem Glyph popular among its early rulers -  Ux Witz Ajaw, or “Three Hills Lord”. The full name of Caracol would be "Three-Hills Water,"  read Oxwitza',&lt;ref name="Martin and Grube 2008"&gt;Simon Martin and Nikolai Grube 2008 Chronicle of the Maya Kings and Queens, 2nd edition. Thames and Hudson, London&lt;/ref&gt; Uxwitza’ or, Hispanicised, "Oxhuitza". This place name may also reference the Three Stone Place of creation.

==Discovery==
The site was first reported by a native logger named Rosa Mai, who came across its remains in 1937 while searching for [[mahogany]] hardwood trees to exploit.&lt;ref name="A. and D. 1987" /&gt; Mai reported the site to the archaeological commission for [[British Honduras]], today Belize. In 1938 the archaeological commissioner, [[A. H. Anderson]] visited the site for two weeks along with a colleague H. B. Jex [Hugh Blockley Jex - who later became Inspector of Crown Licence]. It was Anderson who gave the site its modern name. They conducted preliminary surveys, noted 9 carved monuments, took notes on the structures of the A Group Plaza, and undertook limited excavations in two locations.&lt;ref name="A. and D. 1987" /&gt;&lt;ref name="D. and A. 1995"&gt;Diane Chase and Arlen Chase 1995 Changing Perspectives on Caracol, Belize: Long-Term Archaeological Research and the Northeast Sector Settlement Program. Paper prepared for the 1st International Symposium of Maya Archaeology, San Ignacio, Cayo, Belize. May 29 - June 2, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; A. H. Anderson and [[Linton Satterthwaite]] later discovered 40 stone monuments.&lt;ref name="A. and D. 2008a"&gt;Arlen Chase and Diane Chase 2008 What the Hieroglyphs Don’t Tell You: Archaeology and History at Caracol, Belize. Mayab 20:103–108&lt;/ref&gt;

== Excavations, investigations, and modern development==
The site was first noted and documented archaeologically in 1937 by A. H. Anderson. More extensive explorations and documentation of the site was undertaken by [[Linton Satterthwaite]] of the University Museum at the University of Pennsylvania from 1950 to 1953.&lt;ref name="A. and D. 1987" /&gt; During this time Satterthwaite primarily focused on finding and documenting monuments, later removing several stelae and altars to the University Museum. In the early 1980s, Paul Healy of Trent University investigated Caracol's core area, recording several architectural groups, and noting the extensive terrace systems and high population density for the surrounding area.&lt;ref name="D. and A. 1995" /&gt;

The Caracol Archaeological Project (ongoing every year since 1985) is directed by [[Arlen F. Chase|Arlen]] and [[Diane Zaino Chase|Diane Chase]] of the [http://www.unlv.edu University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV)], United States. The 1988-1989 field seasons researched the southeast section of the site, between the Conchita and Pajaro-Romonal Causeways, to determine the impact of the Tikal-Naranjo wars.&lt;ref name="D. and A. Chase 2003"&gt;Diane Chase and Arlen Chase 2003 Texts and Contexts in Maya Warfare: A brief Consideration of Epigraphy and Archaeology at Caracol, Belize. In Ancient Mesoamerican Warfare, edited by M. K. Brown, and T. W. Stanton, pp. 171–188. Altamira Press, Walnut Creek, California&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="A. and D. 1998a"&gt;1998 Southeast Sector Settlement, A stucco Statue, and Substantial Survey: the Caracol 1997 Season. http://caracol.org/reports/1997.php, accessed November 20, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; From 1994 to 1996, the project focused investigations in the northeast section of the site (near the Puchituk terminus) which showed great time depth dating to the Middle Preclassic, and on the growth and cohesion of the site during Caracol's two major periods of aggression. In the spring dry season of 2009 they conducted a LiDAR survey with an aircraft that allowed a very rapid assessment of the entire site and surrounds, mapping 200 square kilometers, with results published in May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/11/science/11maya.html?ref=science Mapping Ancient Civilization, in a Matter of Days], John Noble Wilford, [[International Herald Tribune|IHT]], 10 May 2010, accessed 11 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The only road Caracol may be accessed by is paved for the last 16km (10 miles) and leads to the Western Highway between San Ignacio and Belmopan and to Santa Elena.

Caana ("sky-palace") is the largest building at Caracol and one of the largest man-made structures in Belize.

==Population==
At Caracol, there are approximately 267 structures per square kilometer, 85% higher than Tikal.&lt;ref name="A. and D. 1987" /&gt;  The site covers approximately 200 square kilometers,&lt;ref name="A. and D. 2009"/&gt; and within this area, structures are generally situated equidistantly and are integrated with the terrace system. The town grew into one of the largest ancient Maya cities, covering some 177&amp;nbsp;km² with an estimated population of over 100,000 &lt;ref name="A. and D. 2008a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="D. and A. 1994"&gt;Diane Chase and Arlen Chase 1994 Studies in the Archaeology of Caracol, Belize (editors). Pre-Columbian Art Research Institute, San Francisco&lt;/ref&gt; with settlement focused along the many radiating causeways (potentially peaking between 120,000 and up to 180,000)

==History==
[[File:Caracol-Temple.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Caana]]
{{Maya civilization}}
The Caracol area was occupied as early as 1200 BC, yet occupation in the epicentral area was no earlier than 650 BC and lasted no later than AD 950.&lt;ref name="A. and D. 2008a" /&gt;  Caracol boasts 53 carved stone monuments (25 stelae and 28 altars), and more than 250 burials and 200 caches.&lt;ref name="A. and D. 2008a" /&gt;

By the Early Classic (between AD 250 and 550) Caracol was tied into extensive trade networks and pan-lowland ideological systems,&lt;ref name="A. and D. 2008a" /&gt; leading to a unified regional economy &lt;ref name="Demarest 2004"&gt;Arthur Demarest 2004 Ancient Maya: The Rise and Fall of a Rainforest Civilization.  Cambridge University Press, Cambridge&lt;/ref&gt;  The Caracol was officially founded in AD 331 (8.14.13.10.4) by Te’ K’ab Chaak.  Special Deposit C117F-1, a Teotihuacan style cremation of three individuals dates precisely to this period, indicating early influences from northern Mexico &lt;ref name="A. and D. 2010"&gt;Arlen Chase and Diane Chase 2010 Household Patterning, the “Collapse,” and LiDAR Ground-Checks: Continued Investigation in and near Caracol’s Epicenter: 2010 Field Report of the Caracol Archaeological Project.  http://caracol.org/reports/2010.pdf, accessed November 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wars with Tikal===
Caracol was at first a client state of the more powerful city of [[Tikal]], 76&amp;nbsp;km to the northwest.  Tikal's influence weakened during the mid-sixth century; losing control of Naranjo, located halfway between the two cities (42&amp;nbsp;km from each site),&lt;ref name="D. and A. 2003" /&gt; to rival Calakmul.  In AD 531, Lord K'an I acceded to the throne.&lt;ref name="Martin and Grube 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Grube 1994" /&gt;  Lord Water (Yajaw Te' K'inich II) acceded to power in AD 553 under the auspices of Tikal's Lord Double Bird (Wak Chan K'awiil).&lt;ref name="Martin and Grube 2008" /&gt;  Then, in AD 556, Tikal enacted a ch’ak (axe) war and defeated Caracol. This caused Lord Water to enact the first known [[star war]] in 562 (9.6.8.4.2), and defeated Tikal's Lord Wak Chan K’awiil (Double Bird).&lt;ref name="Martin and Grube 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="A. and D. 2008a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="D. and A. 2003" /&gt;  These poorly understood conflicts are usually associated with long hiatuses and the fall of dynasties. The name comes from the glyph, which shows a star (presumably Venus) pouring liquid on the earth.&lt;ref name="Martin and Grube 2008" /&gt;  This particular star-war was the cause of the archaeologically and epigraphically demonstrated Tikal mid-Classic hiatus, which saw a decline in Tikal's population, a cessation of monument erection, and the destruction of certain monuments in the Great Plaza.&lt;ref name="D. and A. 2003" /&gt;  This 120-year-long hiatus at Tikal occurred as Caracol's population and monumental construction increased, becoming more prosperous and cohesive. Tikal took on cultural characteristics of Caracol during this time as,&lt;ref name="A. and D. 1987" /&gt; even with the renewed erection of monuments at Tikal, their style mimicked that of Caracol.

Yajaw Te’ K’inich II passed on his throne to the eldest of his two sons, Knot Ajaw, in AD 599; his younger brother K’an II succeeded him in AD 618.  K'an II performed a ritual of alliance in [[Calakmul]]'s territory the following January (9.9.5.13.8).&lt;ref name="Schele"&gt;Linda Schele, David Freidel 1990 A Forrest of Kings: The Untold Story of the Ancient Maya.  William Morrow and Co.  New York.&lt;/ref&gt;  K’an II is described as the most successful Caracol ruler.  Reigning for 40 years from AD 618 to 658, he expanded the causeway system and saw an increase in the site's population.&lt;ref name="Martin and Grube 2008" /&gt;

In AD 627 (9.9.14.3.5), Lord Kan II attacked Caracol's sometime ally [[Naranjo]] in a hubi (destruction) war.  He attacked again in 628, and sacrificed its king.  He then led a star-war against Naranjo in AD 631 (9.9.18.16.3).  He did it a fourth time in 636.  In AD 637, he celebrated his first reigning k’atun by dedicating the Hieroglyphic Stairway at Naranjo itself.&lt;ref name="Schele" /&gt;

===Prosperity===
Beginning in AD 636, there was a building boom at Caracol at the conclusion of the [[Tikal]]-[[Naranjo]] wars.&lt;ref name="D. and A. 2003" /&gt;  Entering the Late Classic period, the site still demonstrated widespread cohesion.  During this time Caracol also had a unique burial pattern, focusing on multiple burials in special chambers.&lt;ref name="D. and A. 1996"&gt;Diane Chase and Arlen Chase 1996 Maya Multiples: Individuals, Entries, and Tombs in Structure A34 of Caracol, Belize.  Latin American Antiquity 7:61-79.&lt;/ref&gt;  This pattern is seen spreading out through the Peten region likely controlled by Caracol, although this spread is independent of other material cultural indicators (like caching practices).  K’an II commissioned more monuments than any other ruler, and ushered in the ‘golden age’ of Caracol.&lt;ref name="Grube 1994" /&gt;

Twenty nine days before his death, Kan II ‘witnessed’ the accession of his successor, K’ahk’ Ujol K’inich II on 9.11.5.14.0 – AD 658.&lt;ref name="Martin and Grube 2008" /&gt;  During K’ahk’ Ujol K’inich II's reign, Caracol was defeated in a star-war by Naranjo, whose only monuments appear at La Rejolla.&lt;ref name="Martin and Grube 2008" /&gt;

Lasting from AD 702 (Stela 21) to 798 (Ballcourt Marker 3), this period lacks any hieroglyphic texts.  Archaeologically, this period is correlated with an increase in site-wide prosperity.  After the AD 798 date, the site core is still prosperous, yet shows less cohesion between the centre and outlying areas.&lt;ref name="D. and A. Chase 2003" /&gt;

Warfare associated with K’inich Joy K'awil on Stela 11 (erected AD 800) indicates the capture of eight captives. In 800 CE, K’inich Joy K'awiil captured the lord of Ucanal.  Caana was also refinished during this period.

K’inich Toobil Yopaat's accession date is not certain (c. AD 804), but he erected five or six monuments, and seems to have repaired relations with Ucanal.&lt;ref name="Martin and Grube 2008" /&gt;  In AD 820, he enacted an axe war against Tikal.

===Collapse===
Evidence suggests that Caracol weathered the initial part of the Maya collapse.&lt;ref name="A. and D. 1987" /&gt;  Through symbolic egalitarianism, it seems that the majority of the Late Classic population had access to ‘elite’ material goods.  However, the transition to the Terminal Classic sees a shift away from symbolic egalitarianism, when the elite developed their own ceramic traditions and had access to goods no longer available to the populace.&lt;ref name="A. and D. 2009" /&gt;

The last recorded date at Caracol is AD 859 – 10.1.10.0.0, on Stele 10.  Caana's abandonment dates to approximately AD 900;&lt;ref name="D. and A. 2003"&gt;Diane Chase and Arlen Chase 2003 Texts and Contexts in Maya Warfare: A brief Consideration of Epigraphy and Archaeology at Caracol, Belize.  In Ancient Mesoamerican Warfare, edited by M. K. Brown, and T. W. Stanton, pp. 171–188.  Altamira Press, Walnut Creek, California.&lt;/ref&gt; several other structures have occupation that dates to the Terminal Classic period.  Structure A6 was abandoned in AD 1050, and marks the final abandonment of the site.

==Monuments==
'''Stela 1'''
* Potentially posthumous monument erected by Kan II to solidify his rule by referring to Lord Water (but not his predecessor Knot Ahau)&lt;ref name="A. and D. 2008a" /&gt;
* Martin and Grube &lt;ref name="Martin and Grube 2008" /&gt; say that it was erected by Yajaw Te’ K’inich along with Altar 1 to mark the 9.8.0.0.0 K’atun ending (AD 593)
* Located behind structure A1 with cached vessels below it, and a small ‘transformational tomb’ behind it containing three cremated individuals &lt;ref name="A. and D. 2008a" /&gt;
* Found standing and unfragmented  by A. H. Anderson in 1938, later excavations by the University Museum in 1950 revealed its association with Altar 1 &lt;ref name="Beetz and Satterthwaite 1981"&gt;Carl P. Beetz, Linton Satterthwaite 1981 The Monuments and Inscriptions of Caracol, Belize. The University Museum, University of Pennsylvania.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;'''Stela 2'''
* Discovered during the 1951 season fragmented into seven pieces, located between the south end of Platform A1 and Structure A9.&lt;ref name="Beetz and Satterthwaite 1981" /&gt; Only the top portion was found
* Depicts a badly eroded ruler from the waist up holding the ceremonial bar
* No date survives
&lt;br /&gt;'''Stela 3'''
* Found broken in two major fragments, one found in 1950 in Plaza A3, the lower portion found in 1953 at the west edge of Reservoir B.&lt;ref name="Beetz and Satterthwaite 1981" /&gt; The lower portion did not seem to have been re-erected, nor was it associated with any other monuments or construction features
* Dedicated at 9.11.0.0.0 – AD 652 by Kan II at his accession (AD 618), it also references his 1st penis perforation at age 5 under the direction of his father, Yajaw Te’ K’inich II (Lord Water) &lt;ref name="Martin and Grube 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Beetz and Satterthwaite 1981" /&gt;
* May portray Batz’ Ek’, who may have served as Kan II's regent/surrogate parent,&lt;ref name="A. and D. 2008a" /&gt; or his mother.&lt;ref name="Martin and Grube 2008" /&gt; The text includes the “arrival” verb (at 9.7.10.16.8 and again at 9.9.9.10.5, although the presence of two arrivals is not thoroughly explained), indicating that whomever Batz’ Ek’ was, they were foreign to Caracol. Batz’ Ek’ is an enigmatic character, who on this stela bears the Snake emblem glyph yet may in fact be from Site Q.
* Shows Site Q emblem glyph in clauses showing its ‘secondary importance’
&lt;br /&gt;'''Stela 4'''
* Probably from AD 583 (9.7.10.0.0), depicts Yajaw Te’ K’inich (Lord Water)
* Found in 1950 by A. H. Anderson in Plaza A3,&lt;ref name="Beetz and Satterthwaite 1981" /&gt; when excavation showed that this was not the monument's original placement
&lt;br /&gt;'''Stela 5'''
* Marks the 9th K’atun ending in AD 613 - 9.9.0.0.0 &lt;ref name="Martin and Grube 2008" /&gt;
* Elaborate Early classic style, showing Knot Ajaw holding the ceremonial bar, surrounded by open portals with emerging named ancestors
* The northernmost in a line of stelae (including Stelae 6 and 7) discovered in front of Structure A13.&lt;ref name="Beetz and Satterthwaite 1981" /&gt; None of these stelae had associated altars, yet a sub-altar cache was found in front of Stela 5 (although this may represent a later offering) which could indicate the previous presence of a Giant Ajaw Altar
&lt;br /&gt;'''Stela 6'''
* Discovered with Stelae 5 and 7 in front of Structure A13 in 1950, and tentatively dates to 9.8.10.0.0 &lt;ref name="Beetz and Satterthwaite 1981" /&gt;
* First stela erected by Knot Ajaw in AD 603 (9.8.10.0.0?) &lt;ref name="Martin and Grube 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Beetz and Satterthwaite 1981" /&gt;
* Originally had over 144 glyphs, and depicted twin portraits of Knot Ajaw and his father, Lord Water
* Makes note of Lord Chekaj K’inich who also carries the Caracol emblem glyph, and may be the younger brother of Lord Water (Yajaw Te’ K’inich)
&lt;br /&gt;'''Stela 7'''
* Dating to 9.10.0.0.0 1 Ajaw – AD 633
* Placed at the southern end of the line formed with Stelae 5 and 6 at Structure A13
&lt;br /&gt;'''Stela 8'''
* Located in the A-Group Plaza to the west of Altar 14 &lt;ref name="Beetz and Satterthwaite 1981" /&gt;
* Badly eroded, the only semi-legible text being a date which is presumably 9.19.0.0.0? – AD 810, and is very stylistically similar to Stelae 9 and 11
&lt;br /&gt;'''Stela 9'''
* Was unfortunately located under a logging road, and is heavily damaged and broken.&lt;ref name="Beetz and Satterthwaite 1981" /&gt; Associated with Altar 4, both monuments were in the center of the A-Group Plaza along the east-west axis facing Platform A10
* Seems to have a different dating than Altar 4, leading Beetz and Satterthwaite &lt;ref name="Beetz and Satterthwaite 1981" /&gt; to suggest that they were not an original pair
* Similar to Stelae 8 and 11 in the same Plaza, which depict a ruler with the ceremonial serpent bar, potentially dating between 9.18.0.0.0 and 10.0.0.0.0
&lt;br /&gt;'''Stela 10'''
* Found in the A-Group Plaza, it displays a glyphic text on one face &lt;ref name="Beetz and Satterthwaite 1981" /&gt; making it unusual in the Caracol corpus. Other similar monuments from Uaxactun (Stela 10) or Jimbal (Stela 2) date to Baktun 10
* Dedication date of 10.1.10.0.0 – AD 859
&lt;br /&gt;'''Stela 11'''
* Erected by K’inich Joy Kawiil in AD 800 (9.18.10.0.0) in the A-Group Plaza (Martin and Grube 2008)
* Suggests that Tum Yohl K’inich is K’inich Joy Kawiil's father,&lt;ref name="Martin and Grube 2008" /&gt; or potentially a related high-ranking military leader
* Discovered in 1953 along the east-west axis of the plaza, near but not paired with Altar 19 &lt;ref name="Beetz and Satterthwaite 1981" /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;'''Stela 12'''
* Found in the A-Group Plaza at the base of Platform A1a, just south of Stela 20.&lt;ref name="Beetz and Satterthwaite 1981" /&gt; The building sequence  indicated that Stela 12 preceded the construction of Platform A1a
* When discovered, A. H. Anderson noted that the stela was devoid of any carving, and entirely plain. While this may be an uncarved monument, it is also likely that erosion destroyed any carving that may have once been present
&lt;br /&gt;'''Stela 13'''
* Located in the front of Structure A4 on Platform A1, and situated near Stela 14, 15, and 16, and Altar 7.&lt;ref name="Beetz and Satterthwaite 1981" /&gt;  It is one of the few Early Classic monuments left in situ by early excavations.
* The iconography on the front closely resembles that of Stela 16, and the back contains enough legible glyphs that the date 9.4.0.0.0 can be assigned to the monument, placing it in the reign of Yajaw Te’ K’inich I. This date makes it the second oldest stela at the site, and confirms the existence of a royal dynasty at Caracol. The iconography is standard Early Classic, with the ruler holding the ceremonial bar while wearing a god mask.&lt;ref name="Grube 1994" /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;'''Stela 14'''
* Erected by Yajaw Te’ K’inich II in AD 554 to commemorate the K’atun ending 9.6.0.0.0 &lt;ref name="Martin and Grube 2008" /&gt;
* Found on Platform A1 near Stelae 13, 15, and 16, and in association with Altar 7 &lt;ref name="Beetz and Satterthwaite 1981" /&gt;
* It was originally thought to be uncarved when first discovered, yet it is actually finely incised and depicts a ruler seated holding the ceremonial bar over a 42 block glyphic text
&lt;br /&gt;'''Stela 15'''
* Dedicated in AD 573 – 9.7.0.0.0 7Ajaw
* Completes the grouping on Platform A1 which includes 13, 14, 16, and Altar 7.&lt;ref name="Beetz and Satterthwaite 1981" /&gt; It is primarily glyphic, although there are small and eroded figures at the top of the monument
* Records the accession of K’an I in AD 531, and a ch’ak (axe) event against Caracol by the Snake polity and Tikal &lt;ref name="Martin and Grube 2008" /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;'''Stela 16'''
* K’an I's only K’atun ending in AD 534 (9.5.0.0.0), erected on Platform A1
* Gives a genealogy and includes his grandfather K’ahk’ Ujol K’inich I, a royal woman from Xultun, and both of his parents.&lt;ref name="Martin and Grube 2008" /&gt;
* Also mentioned is Lord Bahlam Nehn of Copan, although his appearance is unclear
* It is comparatively well preserved, and depicts the ruler with the ceremonial bar standing above three smaller seated figures which appear below the ground line
* In the monument grouping that includes Stelae 13, 14, 15, and Altar 7.&lt;ref name="Beetz and Satterthwaite 1981" /&gt; Along with Stela 15, it seems to have been broken in antiquity and buried beneath Altar 7.
&lt;br /&gt;'''Stela 17'''
* Erected by K’an III, it is associated with Altar 10 to the southeast of B Group &lt;ref name="Martin and Grube 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Beetz and Satterthwaite 1981" /&gt;
* It depicts two seated lords facing each other and accompanied by glyphic texts, dating to AD 849 - 10.1.0.0.0. Originally it seems that there was also carving on the sides, with four large cartouches on each side presumably with one large glyph block in each, although these are now eroded and illegible
&lt;br /&gt;'''Stela 18'''
* Badly eroded, but shows a full figured vision serpent over the body of a bound captive&lt;ref name="A. and D. 2008a" /&gt;
* Erected by K’inich Toobil Yopaat to mark the end of the 19th K’atun, 9.19.0.0.0 (AD 810) &lt;ref name="A. and D. 1987" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Martin and Grube 2008" /&gt;
* Found in the B-Group Plaza, to the west of Structure B28 &lt;ref name="Beetz and Satterthwaite 1981" /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;'''Stela 19'''
* Erected by K’inich Toobil Yopaat in AD 820 – 9.19.10.0.0 &lt;ref name="Martin and Grube 2008" /&gt;
* Associated with Altar 12 at the southern end of the B-Group Plaza in front of Structure B5, facing Caana.&lt;ref name="Martin and Grube 2008" /&gt;
* Once the tallest stela at Caracol, it is now broken into several eroded fragments. Only six glyph blocks partially remain on the front, which while eroded, clearly shows the outline of a ruler holding the ceremonial bar.&lt;ref name="Grube 1994" /&gt;
* Each side of the monument displayed two cartouches with four glyph blocks each, although those on the left side are broken and eroded.&lt;ref name="Grube 1994" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Beetz and Satterthwaite 1981" /&gt; The legible text on the right side seems to be a continuation of the text on the left side, and begins with a glyph that resembles the Site Q emblem. The text also references the two Paddler Gods, who were ‘seen’ by K’inich Toobil Yopaat.&lt;ref name="Grube 1994" /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;'''Stela 20'''
* Only the upper portion is known, and it gives a date of what is likely an accession, but neither the date nor the ruler's name are included in the surviving text &lt;ref name="Martin and Grube 2008" /&gt;
* Located on the front of Platform A1a, and is also nearly associated with Stela 12 which both broke and fell into the plaza below &lt;ref name="Beetz and Satterthwaite 1981" /&gt;
* On the lower portion of the stela, the outlines of four cartouches can still be seen, although their glyphs are illegible. On the upper portion of the Stela are two facing seated individuals with two eroded glyphic text in between. In the upper left corner appear the jaws of what Beetz and Satterthwaite&lt;ref name="Beetz and Satterthwaite 1981" /&gt; describe as a serpent
&lt;br /&gt;'''Stela 21'''
* The top left portion of the stela is broken off, and the lowest row of glyph blocks have broken off and eroded
* Depicts an unknown Caracol lord (Ruler VII), shown with a kneeling captive identified as a k’uhul ajaw (holy lord) of Ixkun,&lt;ref name="A. and D. 2008a" /&gt; although his name glyph is also illegible &lt;ref name="Martin and Grube 2008" /&gt;
* Dates to AD 702 – 9.13.10.0.0 &lt;ref name="Beetz and Satterthwaite 1981" /&gt;
* Found buried beneath the floor of A Group Plaza by A. H. Anderson, its original location is unknown, although it is speculated that it may have fallen from Platform A1
&lt;br /&gt;'''Stela 22'''
* Found at the summit of Structure A2 in association with Altar 17.&lt;ref name="Grube 1994" /&gt; It once had a hieroglyphic text which covered the entire face of the monument; this text is now badly eroded. Two small figures were carved on the top corners of the monument, sitting crossed legged facing each other.
* Surviving text relates events from the reign of K’an II. Importantly, this stela relates the arrival date of Batz’ Ek’ to Caracol at 9.9.9.10.5. This date is also associated with an event with a ruler of Site Q, leading Grube &lt;ref name="Grube 1994" /&gt; to suggest that this indicates that Batz’ Ek’ was a woman from Site Q who helped establish an alliance between the two centers. This alliance eventually led to the combined defeat of Naranjo, which is mentioned later in the legible text.
* The last date appearing on the Stela is at 9.10.0.0.0, at which time the monument was presumably dedicated atop Structure A2
&lt;br /&gt;'''Stela 23'''
* Only a partial stela, found intentionally broken and placed beneath Altar 17 at the summit of Structure A2.&lt;ref name="Grube 1994" /&gt;
* No iconography exists, and only a small amount of text survives. Shows a date that falls between AD 361 and AD 420 and references yajaw te’ which may be referencing a recurring royal name: Yajaw Te’ K’inich &lt;ref name="Martin and Grube 2008" /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;'''Stela 24'''
* Found in front of the eastern building of the elite residential group associated with the Puchituk Terminus plaza &lt;ref name="D. and A. 1995" /&gt;
* Finger bowl caches and broken jadeite artifacts were associated with its erection
* Only a small portion of the original carving exists; no glyphic text. It depicts a ruler below the waist, and a jaguarian figure emerging from a serpentine mouth. A second figure appears on the left, but only a hand is still visible.
&lt;br /&gt;'''Altar 1'''
* A Giant Ajaw altar placed by Yajaw Te’ K’inich to mark the 9.8.0.0.0 5 Ajaw K’atun ending (AD 593) along with Stela 1 &lt;ref name="Martin and Grube 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Beetz and Satterthwaite 1981" /&gt;
* Excavations by the University Museum in 1950 revealed its association with Stela 1 &lt;ref name="Beetz and Satterthwaite 1981" /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;'''Altar 2'''
* A Giant Ajaw altar located in Plaza A3 at the east edge of Platform A1, which Beetz and Satterthwaite &lt;ref name="Beetz and Satterthwaite 1981" /&gt; suggest was a secondary placement because of its uncertain relationship to the plaza floor
* 9.17.0.0.0 13 Ajaw?, although its lack of associated monuments and eroded state make this date tentative
&lt;br /&gt;'''Altar 3'''
* A Giant Ajaw altar dating to 9.5.0.0.0 11 Ajaw or 9.18.0.0.0 11 Ajaw
* Found in front of Structure A1, resting on three limestone legs which were embedded in the plaza floor and associated with the northern, western, and southeastern axis's &lt;ref name="Beetz and Satterthwaite 1981" /&gt;
* Altar 14 is also dated 11 Ajaw, although Beetz and  Satterthwaite &lt;ref name="Beetz and Satterthwaite 1981" /&gt; assign this monument to an earlier date of 9.5.0.0.0, Mathews dates Altar 3 to the earlier date
&lt;br /&gt;'''Altar 4'''
* Dated to 9.3.0.0.0 2 Ajaw, this Giant Ajaw altar is associated with Stela 9 in front of Platform A10 in the A-Group Plaza.&lt;ref name="Beetz and Satterthwaite 1981" /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;'''Altar 5'''
* A Giant Ajaw altar found west of Altar 6 and in front of Structure A3 &lt;ref name="Beetz and Satterthwaite 1981" /&gt;
* B and S suggest that it dates to 9.6.0.0.0 9 Ajaw, although it is too highly eroded to be certain. They also suggest that this altar may have originally been paired with Stela 14 which tentatively marks the same K’atun ending
&lt;br /&gt;'''Altar 6'''
* This Giant Ajaw altar was found along the north-south axis of Plaza A, and dated based largely on iconography to 9.7.0.0.0.&lt;ref name="Beetz and Satterthwaite 1981" /&gt; It was also seated on three limestone legs resting on a plaster floor, similar to Altar 3
* Altar 16 also has the 7 Ajaw date, but is dated 260 tuns later because of its size, associated stela, and iconographic traits
&lt;br /&gt;'''Altar 7'''
* Well preserved Giant Ajaw altar found on Platform A1 beneath the broken portion of Stela 14, near Stelae 13, 15, and 16.&lt;ref name="Beetz and Satterthwaite 1981" /&gt; Dates to 9.4.0.0.0 13 Ajaw
* A disturbed sub-altar cache may indicate the removal of an earlier altar originally associated with Stela 14; the later placement of a cache containing Late Classic materials was found undisturbed immediately below this altar
&lt;br /&gt;'''Altars 8 and 9'''
* Plain and uncarved monuments which some have suggested are not monuments at all &lt;ref name="Beetz and Satterthwaite 1981" /&gt;
* Located in Plaza A3, yet are not associated with any structures or carved monuments
&lt;br /&gt;'''Altar 10'''
* Found under the fallen portion of Stela 17 to the southeast of B Group, and presumably dating to the same period as the stela (10.1.0.0.0?) &lt;ref name="Beetz and Satterthwaite 1981" /&gt;
* It is badly eroded, but the outlines of three figures with the same style headdresses can be seen, along with a few legible glyph blocks
&lt;br /&gt;'''Altar 11'''
* Highly eroded Giant Ajaw altar, it is almost unrecognizable except for the scalloped quatrefoil surround and potentially a dot and bar coefficient &lt;ref name="Beetz and Satterthwaite 1981" /&gt;
* It was situated at the northern edge of Structure B2, potentially placed along the centerline of the structure, although it was not associated with any caches or stelae
* Located on top of several square limestone blocks which appeared to be secondary altar supports, which contrasts the rounded leg supports for Altars 3 and 6, further suggests that this was a secondary placement
* Beetz and Satterthwaite&lt;ref name="Beetz and Satterthwaite 1981" /&gt; suggest the 9.9.0.0.0 3 Ajaw dedicatory date for this monument based on their reconstruction of the dates for Stelae 5 and 6 which would both require a coefficient 3 Ajaw on Giant Ajaw altars if erected on the K’atun ending
&lt;br /&gt;'''Altar 12'''
* Dedicated by K’inich Toobil Yopaat in AD 820 (9.19.10.0.0) and associated with Stela 19 at the southern end of the B-Group Plaza facing Caana &lt;ref name="Martin and Grube 2008" /&gt;
* Depicts Toobil Yopaat of Caracol and Lord Papamalil of Ucanal (who was by this time an ally of Caracol) each seated on anthropomorphic head thrones facing each other, potentially engaged in a palanquin event at Ucanal.&lt;ref name="Grube 1994" /&gt; The text mentions a scattering event undertaken by the Ucanal lord which was overseen by Toobil Yopaat.
* It goes on to describe a ch’ak event against k’ul mutul (probably Tikal) during which a captive was taken by a Caracol ruler who bears the bakab title.
&lt;br /&gt;'''Altar 13'''
* Found in front of Caana at the southern end of the B-Group Plaza with Stela 19 and Altar 12&lt;ref name="Martin and Grube 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Beetz and Satterthwaite 1981" /&gt;
* Dating to 9.19.10.0.0 (AD 820), Beetz and Satterthwaite&lt;ref name="Beetz and Satterthwaite 1981" /&gt; hypothesize that this altar may have been associated with Stela 18, although this matter cannot be relied upon until further excavation reveals the base of the stela in situ
* It depicts an event taking place within a quatrefoil with water and earth symbols at the four corners. There are three figures within the cartouche, the first figure seems to be presenting a bound captive to a Lord
&lt;br /&gt;'''Altar 14'''
* A Giant Ajaw altar potentially dating to 9.5.0.0.0 11 Ajaw, this altar was found along the north-south axis of A-Group Plaza near Stela 8.&lt;ref name="Beetz and Satterthwaite 1981" /&gt; It was located above a well-preserved fragment of Altar 15, and while there was no formal cache, this fragment might be constituted as such
* The occurrence of an 11 Ajaw date also appears on Altar 3, but Altar 14 appears to be earlier, and may have originally been paired with Stela 16
&lt;br /&gt;'''Altar 15'''
* A fragment found in the A-Group Plaza along the north-south axis below Altar 14 &lt;ref name="Beetz and Satterthwaite 1981" /&gt;
* Potentially dated to 9.9.0.0.0 3 Ajaw, it was probably originally paired with a stela (possibly Stela 5)
&lt;br /&gt;'''Altar 16'''
* Isolated at the southern base of Structure B19 (from which it presumably fell in antiquity), it was not associated with a stela, and is the smallest of all the Giant Ajaw altars.&lt;ref name="Beetz and Satterthwaite 1981" /&gt;
* Dated to 10.0.0.0.0 7 Ajaw
&lt;br /&gt;'''Altar 17'''
* This Giant Ajaw altar dating to 9.11.0.0.0 was found resting on edge near the top of Structure A2,&lt;ref name="Grube 1994" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Beetz and Satterthwaite 1981" /&gt; erected on K’atun before Altar 17. Only the upper portion of the stela exists, although it once had 12 small cartouches around the rim. It is also the last Giant Ajaw altar known from Caracol.&lt;ref name="Grube 1994" /&gt;
* Stylistically similar to Altar 2 with small glyph cartouches around the central Ajaw, this pair is distinct from the other known altars. Beetz and Satterthwaite argue that like Altar 2, Altar 17 was not originally paired with a stela.
&lt;br /&gt;'''Altar 18'''
* Discovered on the south slope of Structure B6, it is a severely weathered Giant Ajaw altar
* While Beetz and Satterthwaite&lt;ref name="Beetz and Satterthwaite 1981" /&gt; suggest a 10.1.0.0.0 5 Ajaw date, this date is tentative because of the level of erosion
&lt;br /&gt;'''Altar 19'''
* A Giant Ajaw Altar found near Stela 11 in the A-Group Plaza and possibly dating to 9.3.10.0.0 &lt;ref name="Beetz and Satterthwaite 1981" /&gt;
* Because the known Giant Ajaw altars are paired with carved stelae, Beetz and Satterthwaite&lt;ref name="Beetz and Satterthwaite 1981" /&gt; suggest that it may have been paired with Stela 7 at the base of Structure A13, which would create an east-west alignment
&lt;br /&gt;'''Altar 21'''
* One of the Giant Ajaw altars commissioned by K’an II in AD 633 to commemorate the 9.10.0.0.0 K’atun ending &lt;ref name="A. and D. 1987" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Martin and Grube 2008" /&gt;
* References Kan II's birth date,&lt;ref name="A. and D. 2008a" /&gt; but the majority of the text deals with Yajaw Te’ K’inich II &lt;ref name="Martin and Grube 2008" /&gt;
* It tells that Yajaw Te’ K’inich II's accession takes place under the auspices of the Tikal lord Wak chan K’awiil
* Also references the ch’ak event by Tikal against Caracol in AD 556, and the later defeat of Tikal in a star-war event by Yajaw Te’ K’inich II at 9.6.8.4.2 – AD 562 &lt;ref name="A. and D. 1987" /&gt;&lt;ref name="A. and D. 2008a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="D. and A. Chase 2003" /&gt; and interactions with the Snake polity &lt;ref name="Martin and Grube 2008" /&gt;
* Placed in the A-Group Ballcourt as the center marker
&lt;br /&gt;'''Altar 22'''
* Discovered in the Plaza of the Two Stelae, a residential area connected with the B Plaza by a causeway.&lt;ref name="Grube 1994" /&gt; Found in front of two uncarved stelae, it dates to 9.19.0.0.0 (AD 810).
* Erected by K’inich Joy K’awiil, its iconography repeats that of the earlier Altar 23 – two bound captives sit on Cauac-thrones. This altar deviates from Altar 23 because of its ballgame iconography and titles.
&lt;br /&gt;'''Altar 23'''
* Dedicated by K’inich Joy K’awiil in AD 800 (9.18.10.0.0) in the B Plaza west of Structure B28,&lt;ref name="Grube 1994" /&gt; placed at the same time Stela 11 was erected in the A Plaza.
* Depicts two bound lords from Ucanal and Bital, whose capture is credited to Tum Yohl K’inich, a 3 K’atun Ajaw with the Bacab title and Caracol emblem glyph. This figure is the predecessor of K’inich Joy K’awiil, and may also be his father.
&lt;br /&gt;'''Altar 24'''
* Found in the El Chaquistero group in 1991 on the second highest structure in the group.
* A Giant Ajaw altar dedicated by Yajaw Te’ K’inich II on 9.7.0.0.0. It is one of the first monument erected at Caracol after the successful star-war against Tikal.&lt;ref name="Grube 1994" /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;'''Ballcourt Markers 1 and 2'''
* Both badly eroded, but are obviously a stylistic set. Both show two figures facing away from each other, one a god head and the other an animal. BCM 1 shows a rabbit head facing away from an image of the Sun God.
* BCM 2 depicts a jaguar head facing away from what is likely an image of God N emerging from his shell.
* BCM 1 was found 8m southeast of Ballcourt A, and BCM 2 was found in the center of Ballcourt B.&lt;ref&gt;Patsy Holden 2009 Ballcourt Iconography at Caracol, Belize. Thesis, Department of Anthropology, University of Central Florida, Orlando.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;'''Ballcourt Marker 3'''
* Discovered northwest of the B Group Ballcourt.&lt;ref name="Grube 1994" /&gt;
* Erected by K’inich Joy K’awiil, and associates him with the date 9.18.8.3.9 (AD 798) which is the first date after the epigraphic hiatus.
* It refers back in time to the dynastic founding which took place in AD 331 (8.14.13.10.4)

'''Te’ K’ab Chaak''' (Tree Branch Rain God) is the dynastic progenitor of Caracol, yet is only known from two Late Classic back dated texts. One places him at AD 331, and the second at AD 349.&lt;ref name="Martin and Grube 2008" /&gt;

'''K’ahk’ Ujol K’inich I''' (also known as Ruler I, or Smoking Skull I) appears on the 6th century genealogical text of Stela 16, but his place in the line of reigning lords is unknown.&lt;ref name="Martin and Grube 2008" /&gt; His reign has been estimated to be circa AD 470. He may have been the father of Yajaw Te’ K’inich I.

'''Yajaw Te’ K’inich I''' acceded to rulership in AD 484 (9.2.9.0.16), and is known from Stela 13, which records his celebration of the 4th K’atun in AD 514.&lt;ref name="Martin and Grube 2008" /&gt; His monuments include Stela 13 and Altar 4. He is the father of K’an I.

'''[[K'an I]]''' (also known as Ruler II) is the son of Yajaw Te’ K’inich I, and acceded his father in AD 531 – 9.4.16.13.3.&lt;ref name="Martin and Grube 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name ="Grube 1994"&gt;Nikolai Grube 1994 Epigraphic Research at Caracol, Belize. In Studies in the Archaeology of Caracol, Belize, edited by Diane Z. Chase and Arlen F. Chase. Pre-Columbian Art Research Institute, San Francisco, California&lt;/ref&gt; Stela 15 text gives his parentage statement, and tells that his accession was overseen by a ‘higher authority,’ either another lord or a divine being. His monuments include Stela 16 (which includes his parentage statement) and Altar 14.

'''[[Yajaw Te' K'inich II]]''' (also known as Lord Water), son of K’an I and named after his grandfather, acceded to power in AD 553 - 9.5.19.1.2.&lt;ref name="Martin and Grube 2008" /&gt; His monuments include Stelae 1, 4(?), 14, and Altars 1, 6, and 24. His first monument, Stela 14, records the K’atun ending in AD 554 (9.6.0.0.0). As told on Altar 21, Yajaw Te’ K’inich II's accession takes place under the auspices of the Tikal Lord Wak Chan K’awiil.&lt;ref name="Martin and Grube 2008" /&gt; He erected Stela 1 and Altar 1 to mark his last K’atun ending of 9.8.0.0.0, and four years later he is referenced as ‘seeing’ the 9.8.10.0.0 ending. He is mentioned in the fragmentary text on Stela 23.&lt;ref name="Grube 1994" /&gt; In AD 562 – 9.6.8.4.2 he enacted the first recorded star war against Tikal and Lord Wak Chan K’awiil. h. Yajaw Te' K'inich II's two sons, Knot Ajaw and Kan II, rule after him.

'''[[Knot Ajaw]]''', born in AD 575 (9.7.2.0.3), succeeded his father Yajaw Te’ K’inich II in AD 599.&lt;ref name="Martin and Grube 2008" /&gt; Erected Stelae 5, 6, and 7 (?) to the west of Structure A13, as well as dedicated Altars 11(?) and 15. He was the half-brother of K’an II.

'''K’an II''' is described as the most successful Caracol ruler. Reigning for 40 years from AD 618 to 658, he expanded the causeway system and saw an increase in the site's population.&lt;ref name="Martin and Grube 2008" /&gt; Born as Sak Witzil Baah (“White First Hill”, or “White Gopher Hill”) in AD 588, he took his grandfather's name at his accession. He was the half-brother of Knot Ajaw, and was thus always stressing his legitimacy by referencing his mother (who may be Batz’ Ek’). It is interesting that he never references the rule of his brother Knot Ajaw in any of his monuments, even those that describe his dynastic predecessors. He also seems to have developed diplomatic contacts with the Snake polity, with whom he coordinated the war with Naranjo, which began in 626, and ended with the defeat of Naranjo in 631.&lt;ref name="Martin and Grube 2008" /&gt; His monuments include Stelae 3, 22, Altars 2, 7, 17,19, and 21, and potentially the Hieroglyphic Stairway and Panel 1 from Naranjo.

'''K’ahk’ Ujol K’inich II''' (also known as Smoking Skull II, or Ruler VI) succeeded K’an II in AD 658, but as he has no surviving parentage statements, we cannot be certain that he is K’an II's son. His only monument appears at La Rejolla, and only two stucco texts from Caana (Structures B16-sub and B18).&lt;ref name="Martin and Grube 2008" /&gt; One of these texts shows that in AD 680, Caracol was the victim of a star war from Naranjo (also called Naranjo's war of Independence). Martin and Grube &lt;ref name="Martin and Grube 2008" /&gt; suggest that this action drove K’ahk’ Ujol K’inich from Caracol, at which time he may have fled to La Rejolla 12&amp;nbsp;km to the northwest. The remainder of this text has not been excavated. This star war event seems to have launched Caracol's epigraphic hiatus, which continues for 96 years, until AD 798.

'''Ruler VII''' reigned during the epigraphic hiatus, and erected only one stela (Stela 21) dated to AD 702 (9.13.10.0.0).&lt;ref name="Martin and Grube 2008" /&gt; One candidate for this ruler comes from Naj Tunich, some 46&amp;nbsp;km to the south. In one of the cave's chambers dated to AD 692 is a text referring to a Caracol elite named Tz’ayaj K’ajk’, who carries the emblem glyph, but not the k’inich ajaw prefix.

'''Tum Yohl K’inich''' (also called Ruler VIII) is as enigmatic as Ruler VII. He likewise appears in the Naj Tunich, and also lacks the k’inich ajaw prefix, leaving his royal status in question.&lt;ref name="Martin and Grube 2008" /&gt; In this text, he performs a fire-bearing ritual under the supervision of a lord of Ixkun; an unnamed lord of Calakmul is also involved. All other appearances of his name occur in later retrospective texts like Altar 23, which lists him as a 3 K’atun lord, and the captor of two lords from Ucanal and Bital.

'''K’inich Joy K’awiil''' began a revival of the Caracol polity with his accession in AD 799 (9.18.9.5.9).&lt;ref name="Martin and Grube 2008" /&gt; He commissioned the B-Group Ballcourt, the markers of which date back to the dynastic founder Te’ K’ab Chaak. Stela 11 shows Tum Yohl K’inich in an ambiguous relationship to Joy K’awiil, which may show that he is the latter's father, or as suggested by Altar 23 potentially a relative in a high-ranking military position.

'''K’inich Toobil Yopaat'''’s (also known as Ruler X and XI) accession date is not certain, but he erected five (possibly six) monuments (**Stelae 18, 19, Altars 12, 13), and seems to have repaired relations with Ucanal. This new relationship is depicted on Altars 12 and 13, as well as on stucco text from Structure B18.&lt;ref name="Martin and Grube 2008" /&gt;

'''K’an III''' is little known, and he erected three monuments.

'''Ruler XIII''' is the last known lord of Caracol, and erected only one monument: Stela 10. Stela 10 is a carved all glyphic monument which may commemorate the half-K’atun 10.1.10.0.0 (AD 859).&lt;ref name="Martin and Grube 2008" /&gt;

==Select architectural groups==
'''A Group Plaza'''
* One of the earliest groups at the site.&lt;ref name="A. and D. 2008a" /&gt; Has temples on three sides, and a western range platform supporting six structures; built over the earlier Uaxactun style E Group (completed by AD 70).&lt;ref name="A. and D. 2008a" /&gt; Structures A1-A7 surround the plaza.
* Painted texts from elite tombs in Structure A3 and A34 (the Central Acropolis).&lt;ref name="A. and D. 2008a" /&gt; Tombs from this complex date to earlier than the epigraphic record, and as such cannot be equated to epigraphically known individuals.&lt;ref name="A. and D. 2001"&gt;Arlen Chase and Diane Chase 2001 Continued Investigation into Epicentral Palaces: Report of the 2001 Field Season at Caracol, Belize. {{cite web |url=http://caracol.org/reports/2001.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105013528/http://www.caracol.org/reports/2001.php |archivedate=2011-11-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 8th Cycle dedication caches placed, probably also timed with the completion/dedication of the E Group&lt;ref name="A. and D. 2008a" /&gt;); this predates caching practices at other sites like [[Tikal]] by several hundred years.
''Structure A1''
* Investigations encountered ritual activity in a traditionally non-ritual context at the back of the structure. Stela 1 and Altar 1 were located at the rear, in front of a tomb with three cremated individuals, and over a twice life-size stucco figure which created, modified, and used during the Early Classic.&lt;ref name="A. and D. 2008a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="A. and D. 2005"&gt;Arlen Chase and Diane Chase 2005 Searching for Caracol’s Last Urbanites: Continued Investigation of Small Structures in and near Caracol’s Epicenter: 2005 Field Report of the Caracol Archaeological Project. http://caracol.org/reports/2005.php, accessed October 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Also recovered were two elaborate caches dating to the end of the Early Classic, including a cached ceramic box found at the chest of the stucco figure.
* Construction dates to the Early classic. Probably played a role in the Lord Water (Yajaw Te’ K’inich II), Knot Ahau, and Kan II transition.&lt;ref name="A. and D. 2008a" /&gt; Occupation and modification demonstrated in the Late to Terminal Classic.
* Grouping of monuments includes Stelae 13, 14, 15, 16, and Altar 7.&lt;ref name="Beetz and Satterthwaite 1981" /&gt; This building sequence seems to have begun with a dedicatory cache on the bedrock below Platform A1 containing Early Classic pottery, which was covered over by a floor in which Stelae 13 and 14 were set. A Late or Terminal Classic cache was placed directly above the first and Stelae 15 and 16 were broken and covered by Altar 7 in front of Stela 14 (this indicates that originally, Stela 14 and Altar 7 were not a pair; Altar 7 was a later addition).
''Structure A2''
* Forming the western side of the A Group Plaza, excavations revealed several Early Classic caches and a Terminal Classic tomb.&lt;ref name="A. and D. 1999"&gt;Arlen Chase and Diane Chase 1999 Heart and Soul: A Plaza and Settlement Research at Caracol, Belize: A Report of the 1999 Field Season. http://caracol.org/reports/199.php, accessed October 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Stela 22 which was found 1.5m west of Altar 17, and Stela 23 were also found at its summit.&lt;ref name="Grube 1994" /&gt;
* Excavations revealed that the structure was built in one single construction effort during the Late Preclassic with only minor later modification.
''Structure A3''
* Located on the northern side of the A Group Plaza &lt;ref name="A. and D. 1999" /&gt;
* Painted capstone shows building renovation in AD 696 &lt;ref name="A. and D. 2008a" /&gt;
* Excavations uncovered a well preserved front stairway with the basal portion of a central stair mask.&lt;ref name="A. and D. 1998b"&gt;Arlen Chase and Diane Chase 1998b Termini, Test-Pits, and Associated “Greenery:” Report of the 1998 Field Season at Caracol, Belize. http://caracol.org/reports/1998.php, accessed November 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Two special deposits (a Terminal Classic skull cache and a Late Classic partial burial) were found in association with the stair, but neither revealed any artifactual offerings. The mask here was also not associated with a tomb, as is the case with B19 and B20 on Caana.
''Structure A5''
* Stelae 13, 14, 15, 16, and Altar 7 were found adjacent,&lt;ref name="Martin and Grube 2008" /&gt; and Stelae 12 and 20 were found at its base.
* No tombs were located within its core,
''Structure A6''
* The largest of the four buildings surrounding A-Group Plaza, and dates to the 1st century AD.&lt;ref name="Martin and Grube 2008" /&gt; Two tombs were located in front of the structure, and were both of an Early Classic date,&lt;ref name="A. and D. 2001" /&gt; although no tombs were found within the core of the building.
* The primary eastern temple in the A Group
* Appears to have been the location of long term use, evidenced from cooking vessels and burning dated into the 11th century AD.
''Structure A8''
* The superstructure, excavated during the 1990 field season, revealed a tandem-room structure facing south, away from the A Plaza. Excavations revealed that the earlier platform faced west, and a probe in the plaza floor showed a posthole, although it is unknown if it is associated with the platform or an earlier construction.&lt;ref name="A. and D. 1998b" /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;Structure A10
* Defines the northern boundary of the A Group Ballcourt (Structures A11 and A12). Its earliest construction associated with the earliest floor indicated a Late Preclassic date.&lt;ref name="A. and D. 1999" /&gt; The latest material recovered from the floor of the structure is Late to Terminal Classic effigy censors, indicating a long use history.
&lt;br /&gt;A Group Ballcourt (Structures A11 and A12)
* Altar 21 centrally placed within the ballcourt
&lt;br /&gt;Structure A13
* Associated with Stelae 5, 6, and 7 which originally sat in a line at western front of the structure.&lt;ref name="Beetz and Satterthwaite 1981" /&gt;
* It was obviously a place of dynastic ritual and potentially accession, as it has 3 stelae along its base.&lt;ref name="A. and D. 2002"&gt;Arlen Chase and Diane Chase 2002 Continued Investigation of Caracol’s Social Organization: Report of the Spring 2002 Field Season at Caracol, Belize. http://caracol.org/reports/2002.php, accessed October 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; A purposely burned cache was found within the structure, and probably dated to the onset of the Late Classic.
* Three small platforms, and no formally constructed buildings, surmounted this structure in its final form and the structure itself seems to date to the early Late Classic.

&lt;br /&gt;'''B Group Plaza'''
&lt;br /&gt;''Caana'' (B14-B20, B36, B37)
* Caana ("sky-palace") is the largest building at Caracol. It remains one of the largest man-made structures in Belize. It is situated on the north end of the B Group plaza.
* Rebuilt by Lord Water, and tombs were placed in B20 at AD 577Modified and inhabited during the Classic and Terminal Classic.&lt;ref name="A. and D. 2008a" /&gt;
* Major constructions date to the Late 7th century (AD 650–696)&lt;ref name="A. and D. 2008a" /&gt;
* In total it had minimally 71 rooms and at least 45 benches.&lt;ref name="A. and D. 2001" /&gt;
''Structure B18''
* One of the latest constructions on Caana's summit,&lt;ref name="A. and D. 2001" /&gt; it was remodeled by K’inich Toobil Yopaat in the first half of the 9th century, and include stucco references to Papmalil of Ucanal.&lt;ref name="Martin and Grube 2008" /&gt;
* Its latest construction raised the final floor 4m above the previous floor construction.&lt;ref name="A. and D. 2001" /&gt; Its rooms resembled a palace structure rather than the expected temple, which is further supported by the lack of axial caches.
''Structure B19''
* One of the most important structures at Caracol, and the tallest.&lt;ref name="A. and D. 2001" /&gt; The large tomb of an elite woman was excavated in 1987; several additional tombs have been found in subsequent excavations. Two reentered tombs under the side rooms indicate continued use of the structure into the Late Classic (past AD 700).
* It was originally constructed at the end of the Late Preclassic, and only in the Late Classic was its height raised.
* Painted texts from elite tombs in structures B19 and B20. Earliest known hieroglyphic text associated with a tomb – Structure B20, dates to AD 537.&lt;ref name="A. and D. 2008a" /&gt; One has a painted date that seems to be 9.10.1.12.11 (AD 634), and Martin and Grube&lt;ref name="Martin and Grube 2008" /&gt; suggest that it is Lady Batz’ Ek’
* At the foot of the steps to B19 is a giant ajaw altar dedicated to the Bak’tun ending 10.0.0.0.0 7 Ajaw (AD 830).

&lt;br /&gt;Structures B8 and B9
* Together they create the B Group ballcourt
* A centerline east-west trench was paced in 1986, demonstrating that the court was built in a single construction&lt;ref name="A. and D. 1987" /&gt;
* Its markers include BCMs 2, 3, and 4 (see monument list)

&lt;br /&gt;'''Barrio''' (B21-B26)
* It was undergoing major renovations at the time of abandonment.&lt;ref name="A. and D. 2001" /&gt; It is a palace compound which consists of a series of vaulted structures on a raised platform to the east of Caana and the B Plaza.
* Substantial deposits of Terminal Classic ceramics were found between Structures B25 and B26.&lt;ref name="A. and D. 2001" /&gt; Excavations into the structure's core indicate a Late Classic construction with Terminal Classic modification.
''Structure B21'' 
* Forms the eastern portion of the Barrio complex, and was originally mapped by Satterthwaite. It is an eight-room tandem plan building, and the two rooms facing the courtyard each have benches, but no associated deposits or caches.
''Structure B25'' 
* Dominating the eastern edge of the plaza, whose western stair seems to have been remodeled, although there was little evidence of previous construction efforts. Several of its rooms yielded ceramic vessels, burnt surfaces, beads, and benches.
''Structure B26''
* The tallest building within the Barrio complex, and dominates the northern side of the courtyard. Excavations revealed that the building was never finished, as it was being enlarged at the time of abandonment.

&lt;br /&gt;Structure B28
* It is the eastern building on the B Plaza, and is associated with the Terminal Classic Stela 18 and Altar 23.&lt;ref name="A. and D. 2002" /&gt; Excavations during the 2002 season revealed that this building was primarily constructed during the latter part of the Late Classic.
* Extensive disarticulated human remains were found to the front of the building's steps, some of which seems to have been burnt along with the associated floor. These remains date to the Terminal Classic, and represent the remains of 2 to 17 individuals. These bones were directly associated with the fragmented Stela 25, which is suspected to have tumbled down from B28's summit.

&lt;br /&gt;'''The Northeast Acropolis''' (B30-B34)
* Directly to the east of Caana, on the north side of a plaza created by Caana to the west and the Barrio palace complex to the east.&lt;ref name="A. and D. 2009" /&gt; This structure group atop a large raised platform was occupied from the Late Preclassic through the Terminal Classic, with extensive modification in the later period. The only definite access point is on the western side (presumably with a similar stair on the eastern side) which would have created an intensely restricted plaza space.
* Massive construction during the Late to Terminal Classic raised the plaza over 2m
* A test pit was placed in the center of the plaza revealing an Early Classic cremation dating to AD 330 (S.D. C117F-1) which was recovered from a sealed deposit within the central plaza. Twenty ceramic vessels were recovered in various conditions, many being severely burnt, three of which are reminiscent of Teotihuacan style vessels.&lt;ref name="A. and D. 2010" /&gt; Six tanged points were recovered warped from the intensity of the fire, along with many other elite goods. A minimum of three individuals were present, although the bones were too badly burnt to identify sex or age.
''Structure B30''
* One of two range structures that mark the southern edge of the Acropolis (along with Structure B31). There was no access point to the Acropolis between these two structures.&lt;ref name="A. and D. 2009" /&gt;
''Structure B31''
* As pared with B30, probably contained two inset terraced area, yet their function is unknown. There is evidence of a small stairway to the west of this structure which grants access to the Acropolis.
''Structure B32'' 
* A range structure (probably consisting of two levels originally) situated on the western edge of the Acropolis plaza. Evidence of extensive burning was found on either side of the stairway which extended into the plaza, as well as along both sides of the terrace facings. While dirt fill contained Late Preclassic through Terminal Classic refuse, there was only one Terminal Classic construction effort.
''Structure B33''
* The largest construction on the Northeast Acropolis. Containing 8 rooms, there were no vaulted stones recovered, indicating a wooden/perishable roofing structure. An Early Classic tomb (S.D. C181B-1) was found beneath the summit floor containing one adult individual with head to the east. Evidence of Terminal Classic modification and expansion may be contemporaneous with the raising of the plaza. A test-pit in front of the structure recovered a Late Preclassic cache&lt;ref name="A. and D. 2002" /&gt;
''Structure B34''
* The eastern shrine of the complex, was excavated and deposits show a long history, ranging from the Late Preclassic through the Terminal Classic. Several special deposits dating to the Late Classic were found; no late dating royal tombs were recovered (unlike Caana and the Central Acropolis)

&lt;br /&gt;''C Group Plaza''
* Includes the plaza created by Structures B59-B62, B64, and I19-I20. This plaza and the majority of its associated structures date largely to the Late Preclassic based on construction sequencing and mortuary activity.&lt;ref name="D. and A. 1995" /&gt;
''Structure B59''
* A square collapsed stone structure on the northeast corner of the C Group plaza; it was selected for excavation based on its potential as a shrine.&lt;ref name="A. and D. 2005" /&gt; It was completely infilled with raised benches, and resembles a sweat house except for the missing ‘firebox’ which would have been set to the rear of the structure.
''Structure I20''
* Sits atop the eastern end of I19, a long range building making up the northern edge of the plaza group.&lt;ref name="A. and D. 2005" /&gt; Built in multiple phases all dating to the Late Classic, it had two distinct buildings. Excavations revealed used into the Terminal Classic, and several caches and burials were also uncovered.

&lt;br /&gt;'''Culebras Residential Group'''
* Located southeast of the South Acropolis, on the eastern side of the Pajaro-Romonal Causeway. Set within a terraced hillside, and was investigated during the 2008-2009 field seasons.&lt;ref name="A. and D. 2009" /&gt;
''Structure C20''
* The northernmost of the plaza group's two eastern shrines. It contained a Late Classic tomb (S.D. C179B-7) with a narrow stairway created for reentry; this entry way was sealed during the latest construction effort. This entry was used to deposit a total of seven individuals into the tomb. A concentration of smashed ceramic sherds was found directly over the tomb's axis. The items interred with these individuals indicated access to a variety of prestige goods and tradewares from outside Caracol.

&lt;br /&gt;'''South Acropolis'''
* This area was flourishing at the end of the Late Preclassic, and was an area for ritual as evidenced by recovered incensarios. Moving into the Early Classic, it seems to have functioned as an elite residence.
''Structure D4''
* This structure formed the formal entrance way to the South Acropolis.&lt;ref name="A. and D. 2003"&gt;Arlen Chase and Diane Chase 2003 At Home in the South: Investigations in the Vicinity of Caracol’s South Acropolis: 2003 Field Report of the Caracol Archaeological Project. http://caracol.org/reports/2003.php, accessed October 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Heavily burn but fragmentary human remains were uncovered in an excavation of a previous looter's trench.
''Structure D5''
* It is the westernmost of the three small platforms that make up the southern side of the South Acropolis.&lt;ref name="A. and D. 2003" /&gt; A line-of-stone building overlaid an earlier eastern facing construction dating to the Late Classic, which in turn overlaid a Preclassic floor.
''Structure D7''
* This mortuary structure dominates the eastern side of the main interior plaza, and has three substructures.&lt;ref name="A. and D. 2003" /&gt; A tomb was found on the western slope which included nine vessels (all of Early Classic date), several Charlie Chaplins, and four limestone bars.
''Structure D9''
* This structure is the eastern building of the South Acropolis plaza formed by Structures D7, D11, D16, and three small southern platforms.&lt;ref name="A. and D. 2003" /&gt; Excavations encountered at least two prior constructions, and the final construction dates to the Late and Terminal Classic.
* A crypt was placed in the front of the final construction, containing two adults and several vessels dating to the Late to Terminal Classic. A crude cist was carved out in front of the lower step of an earlier building phase.
''Structure D11''
* A large building which forms the western limit of the southeast plaza, and the eastern limit of the southwest plaza of the South Acropolis.&lt;ref name="A. and D. 2003" /&gt; It primarily faces the southeast plaza, and probably dates to the Late Classic based on limited ceramics.
''Structure D12''
* Defines the south side of the southwest plaza of the South Acropolis.&lt;ref name="A. and D. 2003" /&gt;
Structure D14
* Exists at the western end of the main South Acropolis plaza.&lt;ref name="A. and D. 2003" /&gt;
''Structure D16''
* This structure surmounts the large raised platform that makes us the southern side of the main plaza, and is paired with D17 and D18.&lt;ref name="A. and D. 2003" /&gt;
* An excavated burial containing two individuals dating to AD 500.
''Structure D17''
* Several tombs were found by A. H. Anderson during his early excavations, and include several ceramic vessels of a Late Classic date.
''Structure D18''
* It is the central structure on the platform, and much of it was presumably removed by A. H. Anderson who also seems to have encountered several tombs.

&lt;br /&gt;Structure F2
* It is the eastern building of the Northwest Group, and was severely looted prior to 1985.&lt;ref name="A. and D. 2002" /&gt; Two [[secondary burial]]s were found in the core, and two cist burials were located in the plaza directly in front of the structure.
* Painted stucco decoration was found in the western collapse of the building, and two earlier versions of the structure were also encountered.

&lt;br /&gt;'''Alta/Baja Vista Residential Complex'''
* Situated immediately west of the Northwest Group (Structures F1-F4), and includes Structures F30-F42, and was selected for its occupation by Caracol's secondary elite. 28 special deposits were uncovered during excavations.&lt;ref name="A. and D. 2010" /&gt; Excavations revealed a long history of occupation, dating from the Late Preclassic to the Terminal Classic.
''Structure F33''
* One of the tallest residential constructions at Caracol, and the tallest building at the Baja/Alta Vista complex. It yielded a large number of Late Classic ritual deposits (3 burials and 12 caches), indicating its importance to the complex.
* Sequencing indicates that this structure was first utilized as a ritual location for Late Preclassic to Early Classic caching practices, and for Late Classic burials.
''Structure F36''
* On the northern side of the Baja Vista plaza, it had a facing that was evident before excavation. At least two earlier version of the structure were evidenced, yet no deposits were recovered from beneath the building itself. Several burials and caches were recovered from the plaza directly in front of the structure. From ceramic materials it is possible to date the latest version of the structure to the Late Classic.
''Structure F39''
* The larger of two eastern buildings of Baja Vista and at least four different versions of the building are evident. Two earlier shrines were discovered, and the earlier of the two (S.D. C184B-4) contained a large quantity of ritual ceramics and bone. This earlier shrine was also directly behind a burial (S.D. C184B-7), and directly above a second burial (S.D. C184B-6). In total, three burials, three caches, and a shrine deposit were uncovered, and the majority of these materials date to the Late Classic, one burial dates to the Terminal Classic.
''Structure F41''
* Located on the southern side of the Baja Vista plaza, this structure is the central building of three low structures. It was shown to be a bi-level building with a northern frontal stoop. Materials were limited, but indicated a Terminal Classic occupation date.

&lt;br /&gt;'''Saraguate'''
* Located in the west-central portion of Map Quad 3I, and is 350m east of the South Causeway and explored during the 1997 field season.&lt;ref name="A. and D. 1998a" /&gt; One of the largest architectural complexes in the southeast sector and situated within terraces along a small hill that extends west to the South Causeway.
* Extensive looting had cut through at least one tomb, three eastern and one northern building. The backfill from this tomb yielded a Preclassic vessel; further excavations revealed a Late Classic tomb with a single female individual.
* The largest structure is the central east building and also showed extensive looting. Within the looter's trench were the remains of 3 adults and a partial Early Classic vessel. A two-room tomb was found beneath the stairway, and although looted still revealed four individuals and three Late Classic vessels along with other smaller artifacts. A single Late Classic face cache was found in front of the lower step of the building.
* These excavations indicate occupation dating from the Late Preclassic to at least the Late Classic

&lt;br /&gt;'''Retiro'''
* Terminus discovered during the 1991 field season, at which time a large number of looted tombs were also salvaged.&lt;ref name="A. and D. 1998b" /&gt; The Causeway terminates into a large administrative plaza bordered by low range structures. A second plaza set at the foot of a hill connects is connected by a 30m wide causeway, and contains large pyramids, plain stelae and altars. At the hill's summit, there is a series of elite plaza groups accessed by a causeway stairway. Salvage work was conducted on the southern building of this group, revealing a tomb which had been decorated with red-line painting.
* These constructions date from the Early and Late Classic.

&lt;br /&gt;'''Ceiba'''
* Also located during the 1991 field season, the causeway runs past a still functional reservoir, and the terminus is situated on a high hill.&lt;ref name="A. and D. 1998b" /&gt; Made up of a small group of range buildings, the main plaza area probably served an administrative function. To the south of this group is a larger plaza with sizable pyramids; to the north is an acropolis group. A causeway continues past this terminus and the Guatemalan border, eventually ending at the La Rejolla terminus&lt;ref name="A. and D. 2008b" /&gt;
* Excavation and salvage work done at this terminus indicated primarily Late Classic dates.&lt;ref name="A. and D. 1998b" /&gt; The ‘Pescador’ group to the north also yielded Protoclassic and Preclassic ceramics.

'''Commercial art''' is the art of [[creative services]], referring to [[art]] created for [[Commerce|commercial]] purposes, primarily [[advertising]]. Commercial art uses a variety of platforms (magazines, websites, apps, television, etc.) for viewers with the intent of promoting sale and interest of products, services, and ideas.&lt;ref name="education-portal.com2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education-portal.com/commercial_art.html|title=What is Commercial Art?|publisher=|accessdate=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It relies on the iconic image (pictorial representations that are recognized easily to members of a culture) to enhance recall and favorable recognition for a product or service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/879527515|title=Persuasion and influence in American life|last=C.|first=Woodward, Gary|others=Denton, Robert E., Jr.|isbn=9781478607892|edition= Seventh |location=Long Grove, Illinois|oclc=879527515}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a product could be a magazine ad promoting a new soda through complimentary colors, a catchy message, and appealing illustrative features.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://study.com/articles/Commercial_Art_Professions_Job_Description_and_Information_About_Starting_a_Career_as_a_Commercial_Artist_or_Commercial_Designer.html|title=Commercial Artist: Job Description &amp; Career Information|work=Study.com|access-date=2018-04-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example could be promoting the prevention of global warming by encouraging people to walk or ride a bike instead of driving in an eye catching poster. It communicates something specific to an audience.

People can obtain training, certifications, and degrees that incorporate commercial arts in many exercises, activities, and programs.

==Skills of Commercial Art==
Commercial artists have the ability to organize information and knowledge of [[fine art]]s, [[Mental image|visualization]] and media in a way to reach an audience's attention. Some of these skills may include the following:&lt;ref name="education-portal.com2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* Attention to detail
* Ability to communicate effectively
* Experience or skills in the fine arts (drawing, painting, photography, etc.)
* Knowledgeable of certain computer software programs (graphics, editing, etc.) and ability to use them
* [[Marketing]] skills
* [[Advertising]] skills
* Coordination skills
* [[Animation]] skills

==Genres==
Commercial art can include many genres of art and categories of art technique, including:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://simplicable.com/new/types-of-commercial-art|title=11 Types Of Commercial Art|website=Simplicable|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== [[Consumerism]] within Commercial Art ==
Commercial art is art that is created for commercial purposes to promote services, products, and ideas to viewers.&lt;ref name="education-portal.com2" /&gt; In the process of creating commercial art, an audience is taken into consideration when designing and/or forming the goods that are being advertised/promoted. An example of this can be seen in the recognized works of American painter and consumer ad designer, [[Andy Warhol]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theartstory.org/artist-warhol-andy-artworks.htm#pnt_1|title=Andy Warhol Biography, Art, and Analysis of Works|work=The Art Story|access-date=2018-04-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using [[Campbell Soup Company|Campbell]]'s soup and [[Coca-Cola]] bottles as everyday products of consumers, he recreated a visually stimulating design through [[pop art]] that advertises the products through consumption habits of consumers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Consumerism]] was present when [[pop art]] was popular. Pop art could contain mass cultural objects and/or [[Celebrity|celebrities]] ([[popular culture]] and [[mass media]]) to endorse markets and goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theartstory.org/movement-pop-art.htm|title=Pop Art Movement, Artists and Major Works|work=The Art Story|access-date=2018-04-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Conservation and restoration of metals''' is the activity devoted to the protection and [[Historic preservation|preservation]] of historical (religious, artistic, technical and ethnographic) and [[archaeological]] objects made partly or entirely of [[metal]]. In it are included all activities aimed at preventing or slowing deterioration of items, as well as improving accessibility and readability of them as objects of [[cultural heritage]]. Despite the fact that metals are generally considered as the relatively permanent and stable materials, in contact with the environment they deteriorate gradually, some faster and some much slower. This applies especially to archaeological finds.

It is very important that a conservator of metals has [[knowledge]] of basic [[metalworking]] techniques, history of metalwork, [[history of art]], [[archaeology]], [[corrosion]] of metals, [[scientific]] [[research]] methods, [[theory]] and [[ethics]] of conservation-restoration.

==Deterioration of metals==
[[File:PerseusSignoriaStatue.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Perseus with the Head of Medusa]]'' in the Loggia dei Lanzi gallery on the edge of the [[Piazza della Signoria]] in Florence; picture taken after the statue's cleaning and restoration.]]
An essential cause of deterioration is corrosion of metal objects or object deterioration by interaction with the environment. As the most influential factors of deterioration of historical objects should be pointed out as the relative humidity and air pollution while in archaeological objects a crucial role has composition, depth, humidity and amount of gasses in the soil. In cases of marine or fresh water finds the most important factors of decay are the amount and composition of soluble salts, water depth, amount of dissolved gases, the direction of water currents and the role of both microscopic and macroscopic living organisms.&lt;ref&gt;

==Deterioration of materials associated with metals==
Associated materials deteriorate depending on the origin whether they are organic or inorganic materials. Organic materials usually fail in a relatively short period of time, primarily due to biodegradation. With inorganic materials are these processes considerably longer and more complex. Amount of gases, humidity, depth and composition of soil are very important. In case of salty and sweet water finds essential are amount of gases dissolved in water, depth of water, direction of currents, and microscopic and macroscopic living organisms.

==Metals conservation planning==

===Basics===
As with the conservation and restoration works on any other material,  here are the basic tenets of conservation-restoration based on the quality of execution and the best possible preservation of cultural, historical and technological identity and integrity of objects. Minimal intervention, reversibility and repeatability of preferred treatment are essential, as well as the possibility of easy identification of restored parts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elsevierdirect.com/brochures/shreir/PDF/Shreirs_PreservationOfMetallicCulturalHeritage.pdf Accessed 16.01.2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Recently non-toxic nature of used materials and procedures becomes important too, both in relation to objects and conservator-restorer as a performer, but also in relation to the environment.

===Research===
Nowadays scientific research is an integral part of the metals conservation treatment, at least in highly developed countries.

====Identification of metals and alloys====
*Simple methods - visual examination, spot tests, specific gravity
*Scientific methods - [[X-ray fluorescence]], [[X-ray Diffraction|XRD]], [[Particle-induced X-ray emission]], [[LIBS]], [[Scanning electron microscope|SEM]], electrochemical techniques, [[metallography]]

====Identification of corrosion processes and products====
*Simple method - visual examination, spot tests
*[[Oddy test|The Oddy test]] - for copper, silver, and lead
*Scientific methods - xrd, SEM, metallography

====Identification of materials associated with metals====
*Simple methods - visual examination, spot tests, specific gravity
*Scientific methods - xrf, [[chromatography]],
Raman spectroscopy

====Identification of technology used to produce objects====
*Simple methods - visual examination
*Scientific methods - metallography, [[x-ray radiography]], [[x-ray computed tomography]]

===Decision making===
In preparing the strategy of the metals conservation project interdisciplinary approach to the same is essential. It implies the participation of as many experts as is possible, as a minimum,  we can take curator (archaeologist, historian, art historian), scientists specialized for corrosion of metallic objects of cultural heritage and the conservator - restorer.

===Documentation===
Systematic and well-managed documentation is today an essential prerequisite for quality executed conservation and restoration treatments, including documentation of the state of objects before, during and after treatment. Identification of materials and procedures used to produce object and the results of any scientific research must be part of documentation too. Last but not least- an integral part of the documentation must be a recommendation for further care of object.

===Ethics and ethical problems in metals conservation===
The ethical concept of conservation of metal objects in principle is the same as those in other fields of conservation-restoration of cultural heritage.

But there are several specific problems that can only be found in the conservation of metals - problem of heat treatment of archaeological objects, and the problem of radical restoration of historic, mostly technical, but also architectonic objects too.

While in the first case problem is primarily in the destruction of valuable scientific data, in case of the technical, the architectural, and somewhat less often, historical objects problem is that a radically restored items just simulate the original appearance of the object, and so in some ways that objects can be considered even as, more or less successful fakes, which only superficially simulate long-lost or never existing state of object.

According to the above-mentioned, whenever it is possible real historical substance must be preserved. Thoroughly documented and technically professionally executed restoration of objects, must be avoided because such objects must be seen only as freshly painted surrogates of authentic historic substance.

Ethical problems connected with conservation of sacred metallic heritage objects can be included too.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, J.C.: On restoring sacred objects http://cool.conservation-us.org/byauth/thompson/sacred/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation==

===Preventive conservation===
{{main article|Collections care}}
Metallic heritage objects are sensitive to environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, air pollution and exposure to light and ultraviolet light. They must be protected in a controlled environment where such variables are maintained within a range of damage-limiting levels.

Preventive conservation, also known as collections care, is an important element of museum policy. It is an essential responsibility of members of the museum profession to create and maintain a protective environment for the collections in their care, whether in store, on display, or in transit. A museum should carefully monitor the condition of collections to determine when an artifact requires conservation work and the services of a qualified conservator.

===Interventive conservation===

====Cleaning====
[[Image:HorsesSaintMark1.jpg|right|thumb|Conservation of gilt bronze [[Horses of Saint Mark]], ([[Venice]]).]]

The most common procedure in conservation and restoration of metals is the cleaning process.  This process can be distinguish between mechanical, chemical, electrochemical, ultrasonic, plasma and laser cleaning. In principle, it is aimed at removing dirt and corrosion products from the surface of a metal object.  In many cases archaeology objects only can be cleaned mechanically.

====Reconstruction of missing parts or surface decoration====
In certain cases, metals conservator must re-create the lost parts of objects or restore original surface decoration. This approach is accurate only if we have an exact documentation or photographs of items in a complete, currently non-existent state that we want to return.

New parts must be clearly and visibly marked and at least they must be minimally different from the original historic material.

If needed, those parts must be easily and completely removable from the object, and with methods which will not harm it.

Only cyanide or hexchromate free processes must be used.

Only worn-out spots can be replated.

Replating of entire object must be avoided.

====Stabilization====
Focused on slowing of deterioration of objects – in the case of archaeology objects the thorough removal or blocking of chloride salts. In case of the historical objects it is focused on the use of corrosion inhibitors, conversion coatings, rust converters or eventually oxygen free storage.
*Chloride removal (chemical processes, electrochemical processes)
*Corrosion inhibitors ([[benzotriazole]], [[tannin]])
*[[Rust converter]]s˙
*[[Conversion coating]]s ([[phosphate conversion coating]]s, phosphate/tannin, etc.)

*Waxes:
'''Renaissance Wax{{main article|Renaissance Wax}}

is a brand of microcrystalline wax polish that is widely encountered in antique restoration and museum curation. Although not appropriate for all materials, it is known to and used by almost every collection. It is also used as a primary finish for cabinetry and furniture. Renaissance wax is also used by reenactors of historic swordsmanship to protect armour and weapons. It is widely recognised that this substance is more protective and longer lasting than oil, especially for swords and helmets that are frequently touched by human hands.

To quote a typical commercial supplier of conservation materials, it is used, to revive and protect valuable furniture, leather, paintings, metals, marble, onyx, ivory etc. Freshens colours and imparts a soft sheen&lt;ref&gt;http://www.picreator.co.uk/articles/3_renaissance_wax.htm{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cosmolloid 80 H'''

is refined white microcrystalline wax. It can be used on historical and archaeological metals. Melting point 60–94&amp;nbsp;°C. Soluble in benzol, ether, chloroform, [[carbon disulfide]], [[carbon tetrachloride]], [[turpentine]], petroleum distillates, and fixed oils; partially soluble in [[acetone]], [[diacetone alcohol]]. Main ingredient in Renaissance Wax.

===Conservation of materials associated with metals===

====Precious and semi precious stones====
In principle do not use any solvent, but only distilled water, or a 10% solution of soapwort plant (''Saponaria officinalis''). You must be Especially careful when working on porous gemstones like [[malachite]], [[opal]], [[chalcedony]], [[chrysoprase]], [[agate]], [[carnelian]], [[lapis lazuli]], [[jade]] and [[turquoise]]. Special attention requires gemstones combined with colored metal foils, in this case, the liquid does not come into contact with the foil. Do not use ultrasonic cleaning.

====Enamels====
{{Main article|Conservation and restoration of glass objects}}

====Niello====
Nielloed items can be cleaned only mechanically, never try to use chemical cleaning. Black pigment mixed with Paraloid B 72 can be used for reconstruction of missing parts.
Concentrated solution of Paraloid B 72 or B 67 (soluble in white spirit) can be used as reversible glue.

====Amber====
Do not clean with solvents, do not use ultrasound, you can use only distilled water, or a mixture of water and ethanol (add up to 0.5% crosslinker).&lt;ref&gt;Nikitin, MK; Meljnikova, EP Himija v restavracii, Leningrad 1990th str.268&lt;/ref&gt; Variety of waxy resin mixtures can be used as glue, depending on the color of amber. You can use 10% solution of Canada balsam in toluene&lt;ref&gt;Huck, J; Bleck, RD Chemikalien und Rezepte, Weimar 1990th&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological material can be cleaned only mechanically.
Soaking in liquid paraffin can be used to consolidate and improve color of amber.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ingolstadt.de/stadtmuseum/scheuerer/ausstell/bernst04.htm archaeological site access 23.03.2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
According to one Korean article for consolidation can be used Paraloid B 67 dissolved in xylene (proved more stable than white spirit, usual solvent for B 67)&lt;ref&gt;Ham, CH, Shin, B. Amber Artifact Consolidation Case Study: Impact of Organic Solvents on Amber Artifacts, Abstracts from the 37th Annual Conference of the Canadian Association for Conservation of Cultural Property, Winnipeg 2011th&lt;/ref&gt; According to one American article as ideal consolidant and adhesive can be used Regalrez 1126&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276594058_Conservation_of_amber_at_the_Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art_New_York_USA_Regalrez_R_1126_as_a_consolidant_and_adhesive_for_amber_and_copal  Accessed 15.11.2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  Artifacts must be Protected from strong light and high temperatures, low humidity and oscillations in humidity, in the case of metal/amber objects do not to use corrosion inhibitors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cr.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/11-17.pdf Access to the site Aus Bruchstücken rekonstruiert Ein Bernsteinkästchen der Gothaer Kunstkammer&lt;/ref&gt;

====Oriental lacquer - urushi====
{{Main article|Conservation and restoration of lacquerware}}

Requires a completely different approach than western lacquers. May be found on the Japanese arms and armour. The best approach – leave it to expert for oriental lacquer.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/pdf_publications/urushi.html Accessed 10/02/2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://cool.conservation-us.org/jaic/articles/jaic37-01-009_indx.html Accessed 2.10.2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http: / / art-con.ru/node/651. Accessed 04.12.2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Mixture of 6-8% polyvinyl alcohol and chalk can be used as filling material(Rhoplex WS 24 can be used too).&lt;ref&gt;http://cool.conservation-us.org/jaic/articles/jaic37-01-009_2.html Accessed 18.11.2012 page.&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese conservators use traditional techniques, but as Urushi causes allergic reactions, these methods are not recommended. Clean it with an aliphatic hydrocarbon such as white or mineral spirits. Distilled water or saliva (moistened cottonwool swabs) can caused discoloration and should be avoided by the inexperienced: pH is crucial. Keep objects in rooms with controlled humidity and temperature, preferably about 50% RH, and protect them from UV radiation.

====Coral====
Can be cleaned with cotton wool swabs soaked in distilled water, or with a mixture of distilled water and ethanol.&lt;ref&gt;Nikitin, M.K.; Melynikova, E.P. Himiya v restavracii, Leningrad 1990., p.272.&lt;/ref&gt;
Do not use ultrasound. Avoid any contact with acids.

====Pearls====
Historical objects can be cleaned using a mixture of 70% ethanol and 30% weak ammonia water (1%). To remove the surface layer that has lost luster you can use 3–5% EDTA, after that step rinse with distilled water, and then with 80% ethanol, then with 90% ethanol, and finally with pure ethanol.&lt;ref&gt;Nikitin, M.K.; Melynikova, E.P. Himiya v restavracii, Leningrad 1990., p. 271&lt;/ref&gt;
Do not use ultrasound.
Archaeological finds must be treated as soon as possible, preferably after excavation, you can clean them only mechanically, then consolidate with 2% Paraloid B 72, in the case of dry findings (first saturate with solvent in which it is dissolved), in case of damp or wet findings use Rhoplex WS 24 (acrylic dispersion).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mnhs.org/preserve/conservation/reports/shell_objects.pdf Accessed 17.10.2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
Somewhat More recent Russian literature recommends use of bleached beeswax dissolved in white spirit or medical benzine as protective coating. Fish glue mixed with water and alcohol (7/3), with addition of 1% katamine AB as biocide can be used as glue. Nonionogenic detergent 2-3% in a mixture of water and alcohol can be used for cleaning.&lt;ref&gt;http://art-con.ru/node/4473 Accessed 29.11.2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
Avoid prolonged contact with water, sudden changes in temperature and relative humidity, including strong light or contact with acidic or alkaline solutions (soap water too).

====Mother of pearl====

====Ivory, bone and antler====
{{Main article|Conservation and restoration of ivory objects}}

====Tortoiseshell====

====Jet====
You can clean it with cottonwool swabs soaked in distilled water or soapwort extract (''Saponaria officinalis'', 100 grams of dried root per 1 liter of boiling water). Archaeological material can be cleaned only mechanically. Wax/resin mixtures or concentrated solution of Paraloid B 72 (or B 67) can be 
used as glue for archaeology objects.&lt;ref&gt;Nikitin, M.K.; Melynikova, E.P. Himiya v restavracii, Leningrad 1990., p.269&lt;/ref&gt;

==Storage of metallic heritage objects==
The items should be stored in rooms that are protected from polluted air, dust, ultraviolet radiation, and excessive relative humidity - ideal values are temperature of 16-20&amp;nbsp;°C and up to 40% (35-55% according to recent Canadian Conservation Institute recommendations) relative humidity, noting that if metal is combined with organic materials, relative humidity should not be below 45%. Archaeological objects must be stored in rooms (or plastic boxes) with very low relative humidity, or in the case of particularly valuable items in the chambers with nitrogen or argon. Copper or copper alloy objects with active corrosion up to 35% RH. Iron objects with active corrosion 12-15% RH. Shelves in the storerooms must be of stainless steel or chlorine and acetate free plastic or powder coated steel. Wood and wood-based products ([[Particle board]], [[plywood]]) must be avoided. Also do not use [[rubber]], [[felt]] or [[wool]]. When you are handling metal objects, always wear clean cotton gloves. Lighting levels must be kept below 300 lux (up to 150 lux in case of lacquered or painted objects, up to 50 lux in case of objects with light sensitive materials)&lt;ref&gt;Budija Goran:Čišćenje, zaštita i održavanje umjetničkih predmeta i starina od metala, version December 2010., Zagreb,

[[File:De Constantia (titelpagina, 1584).png|thumb|right|''De Constantia'' (1584)]]
'''''De Constantia in publicis malis''''' ('''On constancy in times of public evil''') was a philosophical dialogue published by [[Justus Lipsius]] in two books in 1583. The book, modelled after the dialogues of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], was pivotal in establishing an accommodation of [[Stoicism]] and [[Christianity]] which became known as [[Neostoicism]]. ''De Constantia'' went through over eighty editions between the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries.

==Themes==
Unlike his later books which synthesised the basic principles of [[Stoicism]] (albeit in Christianised form), in ''De Constantia'' Lipsius focuses on Stoicism's value in strengthening the mind against external troubles and anxieties.&lt;ref name="long"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Long|first=A. A.|year=2003|contribution=Stoicism in the Philosophical Tradition|title=The Cambridge Companion to the Stoics|editor-last=Inwood|editor-first=Brad|pages=381-2|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521779855}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an [[European wars of religion|age of religious disputes]] and persecutions Lipsius intended the book to be both a consolation and a solution to the calamities which he and his contemporaries were enduring.&lt;ref name="papy"&gt;Jan Papy, [https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justus-lipsius/#2 Justus Lipsius], ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''. Accessed 9 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The result is a handbook for practical living, and as such is focused more on moral rules than rigorous philosophical argument.&lt;ref name="long"/&gt; Lipsius emphasises that the mind and the inner life is the site of true goodness.&lt;ref name="long"/&gt; The central theme of the book is the need to cultivate voluntary and uncomplaining endurance of all human contingencies.&lt;ref name="long"/&gt;

==Legacy==
''De Constantia'' was Lipsius' most popular work.&lt;ref name="long"/&gt; Between the 16th and the 18th centuries, it went through more than eighty editions, of which over forty were in the original Latin and the rest were translations into vernacular European languages.&lt;ref name="papy"/&gt;

In [[linguistics]], '''determinans''' (from the [[Latin]] ''determinare'', ''to fix the limits of something'') is a part of speech that modifies another part of speech. In the [[noun phrase]] ''noun phrase'', for example, ''noun'' is the ''determinans'' and ''phrase'' is the [[determinatum]], i.e. that which is to be determined.

The '''Deutsche Orient-Gesellschaft''' ({{IPA-de|ˈdɔʏtʃə ˈoːʁi̯ɛnt ɡəˈzɛlʃaft|lang}}, ''German Oriental Society''), abbreviated '''DOG''', is a [[Germany|German]] [[Eingetragener Verein|voluntary association]] based in [[Berlin]] dedicated to the study of the [[Near East]].

The DOG was officially founded in January 1898 to foster public interest in [[orient]]al [[antiquities]], and to promote related [[archaeology|archaeological]] research. It competed with similar bodies in France and England, and reflected an increased enthusiasm to learn about the [[Bible lands]] in the late 19th century.  DOG focused on the cultures of the [[Middle East]] from early times to the [[Islam]]ic period.

The founders of the DOG included a number of powerful, well-connected and wealthy members of German society, including [[Henri James Simon]] and banker [[Franz von Mendelssohn]].  Their wealth enabled the DOG to undertake expensive excavations in the Middle East.  [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] developed an interest in archaeology, and took the DOG under his protection from 1901, funding excavations with grants from Imperial funds.  It was officially a subsidiary of the German museum administration, so its finds automatically belonged to the [[Prussia]]n state.  Its work was aided by friendly relations established between the German and [[Ottoman Empire]]s.
 
Work was interrupted by the [[World Wars]].  The DOG was reestablished in 1947, and celebrated its centennial at the [[Pergamon Museum]] in 1998.

==Excavations==
DOG undertook excavations in [[Babylon]] from 1899 to 1917, directed by [[Robert Koldewey]], uncovering the [[Ishtar Gate]], the palaces of [[Nebuchadnezzar]], and the [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon]].  Koldewey also claimed to have discovered the [[Tower of Babel]].

[[Ludwig Borchardt]] led DOG excavations in [[Egypt]] in 1902 at the [[Ancient Egypt]]ian [[necropolis]] of [[Abusir]] and then, from 1911 to 1914, at the ruins of [[Tell el-Amarna]], where the famous [[bust of Nefertiti]], now in Berlin's [[Ägyptisches Museum]], was discovered amongst other sculptural artefacts in the workshop of the sculptor [[Thutmose (sculptor)|Thutmose]].

[[Walter Andrae]] led DOG excavations at [[Assyria]]n capital of [[Assur]] from 1903 to 1914, and [[Hugo Winckler]] excavated at [[Boğazköy]] in Turkey from 1906 to 1911, uncovering the capital of the [[Hittite Empire]], [[Hattuša]].  Other excavations before the First World War took place at sites at across the [[Fertile Crescent]] - in [[Mesopotamia]], [[Turkey]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and [[Egypt]] - including [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]], [[Capernaum]], [[Borsippa]], [[Hatra]], [[Jericho]], [[Kar-Tukulti-Ninurta]], and [[Uruk]], but the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]] in August 1914 terminated DOG's excavations.

After the DOG was reestablished following the Second World War, more recent excavations have taken place at [[Habuba Kabira]] from 1969 to 1975, at Tall Munbāqa (also Ekalte ([[Mumbaqat]])) in northern [[Syria]] from 1969 to 2012, near Bogazköy from 1996 to 1999, [[Kuşaklı|Sarissa]] in 1995, [[Urkesh]] in 1998, and [[Qatna]] in 1999.

The DOG produces the annual publications, ''Mitteilungen der Deutschen Orient-Gesellschaft'' (''MDOG'') and ''Alter Orient aktuell''.

==Life==

Prior to beginning his career as a historian, Probert worked as 'a bio-mathematician at [[Grassland Research Institute|Grasslands Research]], then after a succession of other jobs (at various times he made intricate miniature model figures, drove a skip lorry, was a school caretaker, a computer programmer, and even did some building work) he started his own graphic-design business in [[Stoke on Trent]]'. He returned to education in the 1990s, completing an [[Open University]] Arts Foundation course in 1994, taking a First in his BA in Medieval Studies at [[University of Birmingham]] in 1998, and proceeding directly to a PhD at the same institution, which he completed in 2002. During 2003-6 he was a [[British Academy]] fellow at Birmingham, and a visiting lecturer in Medieval History 2006-15, as well as a Research Associate on the ‘Family Names of the UK’ project at the [[University of the West of England]] 2012-14 and, from 2010 to his death, a research fellow at [[King's College, London]]. He also undertook historical re-enactment, mostly of the Viking Age.&lt;ref&gt;Shaun Tyas, '[https://web.archive.org/web/20170707203417/http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/activity/cesma/news/2017/duncan-probert.aspx Duncan Probert: 1961 - 2016]' (9 May 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; He 'managed to combine the hard-headedness of real-world employment experience with an irrepressible belief in the power of human ingenuity to solve problems'.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Jarrett, '[https://tenthmedieval.wordpress.com/2016/12/16/duncan-probert/ Duncan Probert]', ''A Corner of Tenth-Century Europe'' (16 December 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Early Netherlandish Painting''', Its Origins and Character'', is a 1953 book on [[art history]] by [[Erwin Panofsky]], derived from the 1947–48 [[Charles Eliot Norton Lectures]]. The book had a wide impact&lt;ref&gt;Shone, Richard and Stonard, John-Paul, eds. ''The Books That Shaped Art History: From Gombrich and Greenberg to Alpers and Krauss'', chapter 7. London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; on studies of [[Renaissance art]] and [[Early Netherlandish painting]] in particular, but also studies in [[iconography]], art history, and [[intellectual history]] in general. The book is particularly well-known for its iconographic treatment of [[Jan Van Eyck|Van Eyck's]] ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'' as a kind of marriage contract, a hypothesis advanced by Panofsky as early as 1934. The book remains influential despite its reliance on black-and-white reproductions of paintings, which led to some errors of analysis.&lt;ref&gt;''The Books That Shaped Art History'', p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

''Early Netherlandish Painting'' shares its title with the [[Early Netherlandish Painting (Friedländer)|comprehensive, 14-volume survey]] by [[Max Jakob Friedländer|Max J. Friedländer]], a fact obliquely acknowledged at the beginning of the preface.&lt;ref&gt;''Early Netherlandish Painting'', p. vii&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Escape from Tomorrow''''' is a 2013 American [[independent film|independent]] [[horror film]] written and directed by Randy Moore in his directorial debut. It tells the story of an unemployed father having increasingly bizarre experiences and disturbing visions on the last day of a family vacation at the [[Walt Disney World Resort]]. It premiered in January at the [[2013 Sundance Film Festival]] and was later a personal selection of [[Roger Ebert]], shown at his 15th annual film festival in [[Champaign, Illinois]]. The film was a 2012 official selection of the [[PollyGrind Film Festival]], but at the time filmmakers were still working on some legal issues and asked that it not be screened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fearnet.com/blogs/surviving-cinema/v-victory |title=Chiller &amp;#124; Scary Good |publisher=Fearnet.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film drew attention due to the fact that Moore had shot most of it on location at both Walt Disney World and [[Disneyland]] without permission from [[The Walt Disney Company]], owner and operator of both parks. Due to Disney's reputation of being protective of its [[intellectual property]], the cast and crew used [[guerrilla filmmaking]] techniques to avoid attracting attention, such as keeping their scripts on their [[iPhone]]s and shooting on handheld video cameras similar to those used by park visitors.&lt;ref name="LA Times story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Zeitchik|first=Steven|title=Sundance 2013: How did a newbie make an unapproved film in Disney parks?|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/moviesnow/la-et-mn-sundance-2013-escape-from-tomorrow-disneyland-randy-moore-release-20130118,0,4296.story|newspaper=[[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=January 19, 2013|accessdate=January 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[principal photography]] was complete, Moore was so determined to keep the project a secret from Disney that he edited it in South Korea. Sundance similarly declined to discuss the film in detail before it was shown. It was called "the ultimate guerrilla film".&lt;ref name="Movies.com post"&gt;{{cite web|last=Davis|first=Erik|title='Escape from Tomorrow' Cinematographer Explains How He Shot an Entire Movie Secretly in Disney Parks|url=http://www.movies.com/movie-news/listen-39escape-from-tomorrow39-cinematographer-explains-how-they-shot-entire-movie-secretly-disney-world/11004|date=January 21, 2013|accessdate=January 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than suppressing the film, Disney chose to ignore it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/escape-from-tomorrow-ray-moore-disneyland-disney-world-music-box/Content?oid=11314733 |title=All the Disney World's a stage in ''Escape From Tomorrow'' |last=Jones |first=J.R. |date=2013-10-23 |work=[[Chicago Reader]] |accessdate=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been compared to the work of [[Roman Polanski]]&lt;ref name="indiewire review"&gt;{{cite web|last=Goss|first=William|title=Sundance Review: 'Escape From Tomorrow' Takes Viewers On A Mind-Melting Vacation from Hell|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/sundance-review-escape-from-tomorrow-takes-viewers-on-a-mind-melting-vacation-from-hell-20130120|publisher=[[IndieWire]]|date=January 20, 2013|accessdate=January 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[David Lynch]].&lt;ref name="LA Times story" /&gt; However, many who saw it expressed strong doubts that the film would be shown to a wider audience due to the legal issues involved and the negative depiction of the parks. At the time of its premiere, Disney stated that it was "aware" of the film; since then the online supplement to ''[[Disney A to Z: The Official Encyclopedia]]'' has included an entry for the film.&lt;ref name="Disney encyclopedia supplement"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://d23.com/a-to-z/escape-from-tomorrow-film/ |title= Disney A to Z: Escape from Tomorrow (film) |publisher= [[D23 (Disney)|D23]]: The Official Disney Fan Club |date=2013-08-07 |accessdate= 2013-08-07}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Escape from Tomorrow'' was released simultaneously to theaters and video on-demand on October 11, 2013, through PDA, a Cinetic Media company.&lt;ref&gt;Zeitchik, Steven (August 19, 2013).

==Plot==
A montage shows visitors on the rides at [[Walt Disney World Resort]] and the many visuals and [[animatronics]] that accompany the rides. It ends with a man losing his head while riding [[Big Thunder Mountain Railroad]]. On the last day of a family vacation at Walt Disney World, Jim White gets fired by his boss during a phone call on the balcony of the [[Disney's Contemporary Resort|Contemporary Resort Hotel]] with his family. He keeps the news to himself to avoid spoiling their vacation. The family leaves their room and takes the monorail to the park, alongside two French teenagers, Isabelle and Sophie.

The chance encounter with the girls piques Jim's interest, and he makes subtle efforts to pursue them unbeknownst to the rest of his family. He has disturbing hallucinations during the rides, such as the evil faces of [[Audio-Animatronics|audio-animatronic]] characters and his family verbally abusing him. After fighting with his wife Emily, Jim decides not to take his son Elliot to [[Space Mountain]] (which gives Elliot [[motion sickness]]) in order to keep chasing after the French girls. He then takes his daughter Sara to the [[Magic Kingdom]] so he can stalk Isabelle and Sophie while Emily and Elliot return to the hotel. Later, the son of a wheelchair-bound man, whom Jim spotted earlier, shoves Sara, who scrapes her knee. Jim takes her to the park nurse to have Sara's knee treated. Jim and Sara meet a mysterious woman with a glimmering amulet necklace which hypnotizes Jim. He blacks out and regains consciousness mid-coitus with the woman in her room. Afterwards, she claims that the parks' wholesome, costumed princesses are actually part of a secret prostitution ring that services rich Asian businessmen. Increasingly unnerved, Jim and Sara join his wife and son at the pool, where Jim sees the French girls. He swims closer to converse with them, but Emily sees and berates him.

His family returns to [[Epcot]], where the tension between Jim and Emily comes to a head after a drunk Jim vomits while on the [[Gran Fiesta Tour Starring The Three Caballeros|Gran Fiesta Tour]]. Spotting the French girls, Emily argues with Jim about his obvious interest in them and slaps Sara. Embarrassed, she returns to the hotel with Elliot, leaving Jim and Sara to ride on the [[Soarin' Over California|Soarin']] attraction at Epcot, where Jim imagines a beautiful topless woman superimposed over the ride's video footage of landscapes, who promises they will be together soon. After the ride, Sophie approaches and invites Jim to come with them. When Jim refuses, Sophie spits on his face and she walks off, Jim notices that Sara disappeared and searches frantically for her, but the park guards use a [[taser]] to knock him unconscious.

Jim awakes in a secret detention facility under Epcot's Spaceship Earth, where he sees video screens displaying pictures of the woman he imagined on the Soarin' ride and other images of events that happened earlier. A scientist enters and activates a Spaceship Earth resembling helmet, which covers Jim's head and scans him while images of what the scientist refers to as "the real Jim" appear on the screens, being himself dressed differently and apparently part of another family. The scientist discusses Jim's flights of fantasy and imagination and reveals that he is part of the experiment by the [[Siemens]] Corporation ever since he first went to the theme park as a child with his father. His boss is in on the conspiracy and his firing was all part of the plan, and so was the closure of the [[Buzz Lightyear attractions|Buzz Lightyear ride]] just as he and Elliot approached the boarding area, much to Elliot's distress. The scientist also tells Jim that he had turned in Elliot to them, like Jim's father had done to him as a child.

After damaging the instrument panel with a medical ointment and decapitating the scientist, who turns out to be an [[android (robot)|android]], Jim escapes from the laboratory through the sewer. While searching for Sara, Jim trips next to the wheelchair-bound man, suspects and attacks him. After realizing that he caused a scene and doubts the man's involvement, he returns to the room of the woman, where he discovers she has captured Sara, now wearing a [[Snow White (Disney character)|Snow White]] costume. The woman rambles about her time as a character princess and tells him how bad things happen everywhere, including the decapitation at the park. She again hypnotizes Jim with the necklace, but Sara pulls it off and smashes it, freeing Jim from her spell. He returns to his hotel room and puts his family to bed. Jim suffers with digestive distress, vomits up a large amount of blood and [[hairballs]], which he recognizes as symptoms of the cat flu. He begins to panic and bleed uncontrollably in the bathroom. Elliot enters and Jim begs him for help, but he closes the door on him.

The next morning, Emily finds Jim's corpse, which now has cat eyes and a grinning face. Disney cleaning staff arrive to remove proof of death and fill Elliot's head with false memories of riding the Buzz Lightyear attraction. They take Jim's body to the unmarked white van from the opening. Meanwhile, the valet from the video screens greets the "real Jim", accompanied by the fantasy woman and a young girl, before they check into the hotel as the valet watches the van drive away.

==Background==
Moore, a native of [[Lake Bluff, Illinois]],&lt;ref name="Sundance page"&gt;{{cite web|title=Escape From Tomorrow|url=http://filmguide.sundance.org/film/13030/escape_from_tomorrow|publisher=[[Sundance Film Festival]]|year=2013|accessdate=January 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; frequently visited his father in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]] following his parents' divorce. The two often spent time together at [[Walt Disney World Resort|Walt Disney World]] nearby. "It was a special, physical place, and it became an emotional space," he told ''[[Filmmaker (magazine)|Filmmaker]].'' He added: "Obviously, I have a lot of father issues that I can't separate from that place."&lt;ref name="Filmmaker article"&gt;{{cite web|last=Macaulay|first=Scott|title=The Outlaw Pleasures of ''Escape from Tomorrow''|url=http://filmmakermagazine.com/63499-the-outlaw-pleasures-of-escape-from-tomorrow/|publisher=[[Filmmaker (magazine)|Filmmaker]]|date=January 19, 2013|accessdate=January 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, their relationship deteriorated.&lt;ref name="IndieWire interview"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kohn|first=Eric|title=Sundance 2013: 'Escape From Tomorrow' Director Randy Moore Says "I'm a Product of Disney World"|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/sundance-interview-escape-from-tomorrow-director-randy-moore-says-im-a-product-of-disney-world|publisher=[[IndieWire]]|date=January 27, 2013|accessdate=January 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He decided to pursue a career in film. After attending two other film schools, he graduated from [[Full Sail University]] in another [[Central Florida]] town, [[Winter Park, Florida|Winter Park]], as the class [[valedictorian]]. He moved to [[Southern California]] and began working as a [[story editor]], primarily doing uncredited rewrites.&lt;ref name="Sundance page" /&gt;

In Hollywood, he married and started a family. Much like his own father, he frequently took his own children to [[Disneyland]]. "It wasn't until our first family trip together that this very visceral emotional landscape of my past, that I had by now nearly all but forgotten, hit me again like [a] bullet."&lt;ref name="Filmmaker five questions"&gt;{{cite web|last=Schoenbrun|first=Dan|title=Five Questions with ''Escape from Tomorrow'' Director Randy Moore|url=http://filmmakermagazine.com/63249-five-questions-with-escape-from-tomorrow-director-randy-moore/|publisher=[[Filmmaker (magazine)|Filmmaker]]|date=January 19, 2013|accessdate=January 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the family's first trip to Walt Disney World, the emotions grew stronger. "[I]t was like he was there as a ghost. We were going on the same rides I used to go on with him, but now we're no longer talking anymore."&lt;ref name="IndieWire interview" /&gt;

His wife, a native of the [[former Soviet Union]] who had no memories or expectations like his, saw things with fresh eyes. Moore said "She's a nurse and goes between floors at hospitals. At one point she turned to me at some princess fair or something and said, 'This is worse than working the psych [ward] at the hospital.'"&lt;ref name="IndieWire interview" /&gt;

He read [[Neal Gabler]]'s biography of [[Walt Disney]] and took the children to Disneyland more frequently.&lt;ref name="IndieWire interview" /&gt; "I became obsessed with finding a connection," he recalled later.&lt;ref name="Filmmaker five questions" /&gt; He wrote the screenplay for ''Escape from Tomorrow'' in a month along with two others.&lt;ref name="IndieWire interview" /&gt; An inheritance from his grandparents provided the bulk of the film's budget,&lt;ref name="LA Times story" /&gt; which he put at around $650,000, triple what he had originally planned.&lt;ref name="IndieWire interview" /&gt;

"There was nowhere else to do it," Moore says of his decision to use Disney World as a setting and shoot at the parks. Disney, which has a reputation for aggressively protecting its [[intellectual property]], has been tolerant of visitors uploading videos of their visits to [[YouTube]] and elsewhere since most of those user-created videos project a positive image of the parks. But Moore did not expect to get permission from Disney to shoot there given his negative, [[surrealistic]] portrayal of the park.&lt;ref name="NY Times article"&gt;{{cite news|last=Barnes|first=Brooks|title=It's a Grim World, After All|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/21/movies/escape-from-tomorrow-at-sundance-scrutinizes-disney.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=January 21, 2013|accessdate=January 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead he used [[guerrilla filmmaking]] techniques, which sometimes call for using locations without getting permission. ''Escape from Tomorrow'' is not the first film made in whole, or part, this way at the Disney parks. In 2010, the British [[street art]]ist [[Banksy]] shot a scene for ''[[Exit Through the Gift Shop]]'' in one of the parks with his collaborator [[Mr. Brainwash]]. They managed to smuggle the footage out after being detained and questioned by park security. The following year, a [[viral video|viral]] [[found footage (pseudo-documentary)|found footage]] short, ''Missing in the Mansion'',&lt;ref name="Missing in the Mansion"&gt;{{cite web|title=Missing in the Mansion|url=http://www.missinginthemansion.com/|publisher=Daws Brothers Studios|year=2011|accessdate=January 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; filmed in [[the Haunted Mansion]], was distributed online without interference from Disney.&lt;ref name="/Film post"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sciretta|first=Peter|title='Escape From Tomorrow': A Feature Film Shot in Disney Theme Parks Without Disney's Permission [Sundance 2013 Review]|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/escape-from-tomorrow-a-feature-film-shot-in-disney-theme-parks-without-disneys-permission-sundance-2013-review/|publisher=[[/Film]]|date=January 21, 2013|accessdate=January 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extensive pre-production was necessary. The unique nature of the film shoot dictated steps not normally taken in filmmaking, such as charting the position of the sun weeks in advance since they could not use lighting equipment. Scenes were rehearsed and [[Blocking (stage)|blocked]] in hotel rooms, rather than the actual locations.&lt;ref name="/Film post" /&gt; "We must have walked through the entire movie at least eight or nine times during multiple scouting trips before we ever rolled camera," Moore says.&lt;ref name="Filmmaker five questions" /&gt;

Before [[principal photography]], the cast and crew bought season passes to both the Disneyland and Walt Disney World resorts. They spent ten days in Florida, then returned to California for two weeks at Disneyland, making the parks depicted in the film a combination of both resorts.&lt;ref name="/Film post" /&gt; Actors and crew entered the parks in small groups to avoid attracting attention.&lt;ref name="NY Times article" /&gt; "At one point, I even made the camera department shave off their facial hair and dress in tourist attire, which almost provoked a mutiny," says Moore.&lt;ref name="Filmmaker five questions" /&gt; Despite the actors wearing the same clothes for days on end, Moore told the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', park personnel never appeared to notice them,&lt;ref name="LA Times story" /&gt; save for one day near the end of filming when Disneyland security thought they were [[paparazzi]] harassing a celebrity family.&lt;ref name="/Film post" /&gt;
[[File:Canon EOS 5D Mark II with 50mm 1.4 edit1.jpg|left|thumb|A Canon EOS 5D Mark II|alt=A black camera with a short lens barrel and large hand grip on the left. "Canon" is visible above the lens, and "EOS 5D" on the right.]]
The film was shot using the video mode of two [[Canon EOS 5D Mark II]] and one [[Canon EOS 1D Mark IV]] [[digital single-lens reflex]] cameras, which helped the filmmakers look more like typical park visitors.&lt;ref name="/Film post" /&gt; To compensate for their inability to control the lighting, the film was shot in [[monochrome]] mode. "[W]e were shooting with really [[Lens speed#Fast lenses|fast lenses]] wide open, so our [[depth of field]] was razor thin. Black and white helped us enormously with focus and composition, since we were doing almost everything in camera and didn't use a [[focus puller]]," Moore recalled. It was an irreversible choice. "[B]ecause the 5D doesn't shoot [[Uncompressed video|RAW]], we customized settings in its monochromatic mode and couldn't go back to color, even if we had wanted to."&lt;ref name="Filmmaker five questions" /&gt; Moore was comfortable with the result because of the surrealistic, dreamlike quality it created, forcing viewers to see the familiar sights of the Disney parks in a new way.&lt;ref name="/Film post" /&gt;

Actors and crew used their [[iPhone]]s to communicate and store information such as the script—that way, they looked like guests casually using their phones.&lt;ref name="LA Times story" /&gt; The phones were also used to record sound, in addition to digital recorders taped to each actor's body that were left running all day.&lt;ref name="/Film post" /&gt; For day scenes, Moore felt comfortable risking only three or four takes of each scene, but found he could do more at night.&lt;ref name="Filmmaker five questions" /&gt;
[[File:Escape from Tomorrow publicity still from It's A Small World.jpg|thumb|right|Sara (left) and Jim (right) riding It's A Small World|alt=A black-and-white image of a young girl on the left and a middle-aged man sitting on a bench with a patterned background and others doing the same behind them. She is looking at him while he appears to grimace]] Scenes involved riding on eight recognizable attractions in the parks. One required waiting in a long line for the [[Buzz Lightyear attractions|Buzz Lightyear]] ride at Disneyland, and the actors rode [[It's a Small World]] at least 12 times to get the scene right. "I was surprised the ride operators weren't a little more savvy," Moore told ''[[The New York Times]]''. For a scene where two characters pass on the People Mover, Moore had the actors ride it for hours while he worked out the timing.&lt;ref name="NY Times article" /&gt;

After the location filming, production went back to [[soundstage]]s for interiors. Some scenes were shot against a [[Chroma key|green screen]] background for [[second unit]] footage of other locations to be substituted, allowing the use of [[crane shot]]s.&lt;ref name="Filmmaker article" /&gt; With the photography done, Moore took the film to [[South Korea]] to [[film editing|edit]] to prevent Disney from finding out; he also refused to tell most of his close friends what he was doing.&lt;ref name="LA Times story" /&gt; [[Visual effects]] were done by the same company there that had done them for the 2006 South Korean monster film, ''[[The Host (2006 film)|The Host]]''.&lt;ref name="/Film post" /&gt;

The post-production tasks were as challenging as the production itself. [[Sound editor (filmmaking)|Sound editors]] had to listen to the entire uncut tracks from the recorders taped to the actors' bodies in order to find the dialogue. Content proprietary to Disney, such as the lyrics to "[[It's a small world (after all)|It's a Small World]]" and footage from [[Soarin' Over California#Epcot|Soarin']], was removed from the film to avoid [[Copyright infringement of audio-visual works|copyright infringement]].&lt;ref name="/Film post" /&gt; Composer [[Abel Korzeniowski]] contributed a light, airy score similar to those used in [[Classical Hollywood cinema|Hollywood's Golden Age]].&lt;ref name="LA Times story" /&gt;

==Sundance==
Moore submitted the completed film to the [[Sundance Film Festival]], where many independent films seek distributors. He had little hope that it would be accepted due to the festival's corporate sponsors. But Trevor Groth, the festival's new director of programming, was "blown away" by ''Escape from Tomorrow'', and accepted it for the festival's non-competitive "Next" category, for films that transcend the limitations of the low budgets common to most independent films.&lt;ref name="LA Times story" /&gt;

When the [[2013 Sundance Film Festival|2013 festival]] began in [[Park City, Utah]], the secrecy about the movie continued. The festival's website only identified the setting as a theme park.&lt;ref name="Sundance page" /&gt; Nan Chalat-Noaker, critic for the ''[[Park Record]]'', recalls that the festival and even the film's publicist were unwilling to share further details about the film, but strongly urged critics to see it. In her review, she declined to identify the setting of the film by name, although she dropped broad hints, out of fear it would alert Disney's lawyers. The premiere, on the festival's first night, was not fully attended; when word got out to the attendees, all the other shows were effectively sold out.&lt;ref name="Park Record review"&gt;{{cite news|last=Chalat-Noaker |first=Nan |title="Escape" takes audience on horror-filled roller coaster ride |url=http://www.parkrecord.com/ci_22409760/escape-takes-audience-horror-filled-roller-coaster-ride |newspaper=[[Park Record]] |location=[[Park City, Utah|Park City, UT]] |publisher=[[MediaNews Group]] |date=January 19, 2013 |accessdate=January 23, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410142249/http://www.parkrecord.com/ci_22409760/escape-takes-audience-horror-filled-roller-coaster-ride |archivedate=April 10, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
On review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 54% based on 81 reviews, with an average rating of 6/10. The site's critical consensus reads: "Conceptually audacious but only intermittently successful in execution, ''Escape From Tomorrow'' is nonetheless visually inventive and darkly surreal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/escape_from_tomorrow_2013/ |title = Escape From Tomorrow (2013) |work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate = February 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 58 out of 100, based on 27 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/escape-from-tomorrow |title=Escape from Tomorrow reviews |website=Metacritic |accessdate=January 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the [[Martin Luther King Day]] weekend was over, ''Escape from Tomorrow'' was being widely discussed by festival attendees. ''The New York Times'' and the ''Los Angeles Times'' both ran articles about the film and Moore. Much of the attention focused on the audacity of the filmmaking. [[Movies.com]] reported that people were already calling it "the ultimate guerrilla film".&lt;ref name="Movies.com post" /&gt; On the night of the premiere, [[Drew McWeeny]] wrote:

{{quote|It is not possible that this film exists. It is not possible that they shot long scripted sequences on the actual rides. It is not possible that I just saw a film in which it is suggested and then shown that the various Disney princesses all work as high-priced hookers who sell their wares to wealthy Asian businessmen. It simply cannot be true.

I grew up in Florida, and I have been going to Walt Disney World my entire life. I worked at that park. I've been there as a child, as a teenager, as an employee, and as a parent. I've done Disney sitting on my father's shoulders, and I've done the Disney parks with my kids sitting on my shoulders. It is a huge part of my DNA, and I can tell you that there is no way Randy Moore pulled off what I saw tonight. It is a film that should not exist by any rational definition.

And yet... not only does it exist, but it's fascinating.&lt;ref name="McWeeny review"&gt;{{cite web|last=McWeeny |first=Drew |authorlink=Drew McWeeny |title='Escape From Tomorrow' is a surrealist treat that will give Disney's lawyers nightmares |url=http://www.hitfix.com/motion-captured/review-escape-from-tomorrow-is-a-surrealist-treat-that-will-give-disneys-lawyers-nightmares |publisher=[[HitFix]] |date=January 19, 2013 |accessdate=January 23, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123060637/http://www.hitfix.com/motion-captured/review-escape-from-tomorrow-is-a-surrealist-treat-that-will-give-disneys-lawyers-nightmares |archivedate=January 23, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} He allowed that it was "undisciplined at times, rough around the edges in places, technically uneven, and there's no sense of pacing to it at all. Even so," he concluded, "there is a sort of naive charm that makes it impossible to look away."&lt;ref name="McWeeny review" /&gt;

Other critics concurred that the film had artistic merit. "[W]atching Moore's noir tale is like being super-glued to your seat while getting poked in the eye," Chalat-Noaker wrote. "It's both fascinating and repelling."&lt;ref name="Park Record review" /&gt; Stephen Zeitchik of the ''Los Angeles Times'' called it "one of the strangest and most provocative movies this reporter has seen in eight years attending the Sundance Film Festival".&lt;ref name="LA Times story" /&gt; At [[Indiewire]], Eric Kohn wrote that "Moore portrays Disney World as the ultimate horror show {{ndash}} and gets the point across in nearly every scene".&lt;ref name="IndieWire review"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kohn|first=Eric|title=Sundance Review: 'Escape From Tomorrow' Is a Surreal Indictment of Disneyfied Society That Disney Will Never Let You See|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/sundance-review-escape-from-tomorrow-is-a-surreal-indictment-of-disneyfied-society-that-disney-will-never-let-you-see|publisher=[[Indiewire]]|date=January 18, 2013|accessdate=January 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
While they conceded the film's audacious production made it worth their time to watch, other critics found flaws. "It's not a great film. The story has some good ideas, but the execution is uneven," wrote Peter Sciretta at [[/Film]], while still recommending it as "unlike anything you've seen before [or will] see again".&lt;ref name="/Film post" /&gt; Similarly, [[CraveOnline]]'s William Bibbiani "wouldn't have missed it for the world" but qualified it by noting that the film often lacked "cohesion and clarity".&lt;ref name="CraveOnline review"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bibbiani|first=William|title=Sundance 2013 Review: Escape from Tomorrow|url=http://www.craveonline.com/film/reviews/203497-sundance-2013-review-escape-from-tomorrow|publisher=[[CraveOnline]]|date=January 22, 2013|accessdate=January 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kyle Smith]] of the ''[[New York Post]]'' had the most negative assessment, calling it "more fun to discuss than to sit through". While he found the guerilla filmmaking aspect of it "intriguing", all it amounted to for him was "a couple of amusingly surreal moments" that could have taken place at any sufficiently large amusement park: "Even Disney-hating hipsters are going to be disappointed; the film is a pure festival play that is more or less unreleasable unless theater owners start selling [[marijuana|weed]] along with popcorn."&lt;ref name="NY Post review"&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith |first=Kyle |authorlink=Kyle Smith |title=Sundance review: 'Escape from Tomorrow' |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/blogs/movies/sundance_review_escape_from_tomorrow |newspaper=[[New York Post]] |date=January 21, 2013 |accessdate=January 23, 2013 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal issues==
Many journalists who saw the film at Sundance speculated that it was likely that Disney would take legal action to prevent the film from being shown outside the festival, or perhaps even during it. "Disney's lawyers are probably climbing onto helicopters and planning a raid on Park City right now," wrote McWeeny.&lt;ref name="McWeeny review" /&gt; Critics urged others present to see it before it was too late, and commented that it was questionable if those not present at the festival would ever have an opportunity to see it.&lt;ref name="IndieWire review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CraveOnline review" /&gt;

However, others noted that if Disney had attempted to block the film's release, it was unclear on what legal grounds it could be done. Moore took care to avoid direct [[copyright infringement]] of songs or films played as part of attractions, and intellectual property law is less clear on the other aspects of the film. Science fiction writer [[Cory Doctorow]], who distributed his first novel, ''[[Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom]]'', set in a 22nd-century Disney World, under a [[Creative Commons]] license, believes there's at most "a possible [[trademark infringement|trademark]] claim, and I suppose that Disney could conceivabl[y] bring suit for violating the park's [[Terms of service|terms of use]], but these are much harder cases to make than copyright."&lt;ref name="Cory Doctorow post"&gt;{{cite web|last=Doctorow|first=Cory|authorlink=Cory Doctorow|title=More on "Escape From Tomorrow," the guerrilla art-house movie shot at Walt Disney World and Disneyland|url=http://boingboing.net/2013/01/21/more-on-escape-from-tomorrow.html|publisher=[[Boing Boing]]|date=January 21, 2013|accessdate=January 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Columbia Law School]] professor [[Tim Wu]] did not think Disney would have any defensible intellectual property claim. "Though the filmmakers may have committed trespass when they broke Disney World's rules and if it violated the terms of entry on their tickets, the film itself is a different matter," he wrote on ''[[The New Yorker]]'''s blog. "As commentary on the social ideals of Disney World, it seems to clearly fall within a well-recognized category of [[fair use]], and therefore probably will not be stopped by a court using copyright or trademark laws."&lt;ref name="Wu New Yorker post"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wu|first=Tim|authorlink=Tim Wu|title=It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad Disney World|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2013/01/escape-from-tomorrow-disney-world-and-the-law-of-fair-use.html|newspaper=[[The New Yorker]]|date=January 22, 2013|accessdate=January 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the film's repeated use of Disney's characters and iconography, Wu explained, trademark law was not sufficient. "Disney does not have some kind of general intellectual-property right in Disney World itself." To make a trademark-infringement case against Moore, he continued, Disney would have to convince a court that the use of its protected imagery in the movie could reasonably lead viewers to believe that it had a role in the film's production, and he did not think that was a plausible argument. "The scene where a Disney Princess attempts to crush a child seems to eliminate that possibility."&lt;ref name="Wu New Yorker post" /&gt;

As for copyright, Wu saw Moore's use of the Disney parks as [[Transformation (law)|transformative]]:
{{quote|... [H]is use of Disney World is not as simple window dressing; he transforms it into something gruesome and disturbing—a place where, for example, guests are sometimes [[taser]]ed and have their imaginations purged ... It might be a violation if Moore had made a film designed for viewers who wanted to see Disney World but were too lazy to go to Florida. ''Escape from Tomorrow,'' however, is clearly no substitute for buying a ticket.&lt;ref name="Wu New Yorker post" /&gt;}}
As such, he saw the film as offering artistic commentary on the cultural impact of Disney, and thus clearly falling under fair use. Wu likened it to a 1990s case brought by Mattel against artist Thomas Forsythe, after he sold some of his photographs depicting another American icon, [[Barbie]], being eaten by vintage appliances as a way of calling attention to the toy doll's role in promoting the objectification of women in American culture. Not only did the court dismiss Mattel's complaint, "[t]he judges were so annoyed by the lawsuits that they awarded attorney's fees of nearly two million dollars to the artist ... A judge has to think of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] when asked to ban art work."&lt;ref name="Wu New Yorker post" /&gt;

In his /Film review, Sciretta raised another issue:
{{quote|Intellectual property and copyrights aside, many people appear in this film who have never signed a [[Legal release|release]]. Real families and children are seen in the background of almost every shot. None of them gave permission or knew they were being filmed for a feature film.&lt;ref name="/Film post" /&gt;}}
At ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', Aisha Harris allowed that this was a possibility, especially if children were filmed without their parents' consent, but noted "the law on that issue is not black and white either."&lt;ref name="Slate article"&gt;{{cite web|last=Harris|first=Aisha|title=Will Disney Let You See This Movie?|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2013/01/23/escape_from_tomorrow_filmed_secretly_at_disney_parks_can_disney_block_the.html|publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=January 23, 2013|accessdate=January 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response by Disney===
Disney did not return reporters' calls or emails for comment, nor took any legal action during the festival, although it confirmed to [[CNN]] that it was "aware" of the movie.&lt;ref name="CNN story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Carey|first=Matthew|title=Why Disney might want to 'Escape From Tomorrow'|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/24/showbiz/movies/escape-tomorrow-sundance-disney/|newspaper=[[CNN]]|date=January 24, 2013|accessdate=January 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite critical apprehension that the film would never be shown outside the festival, some observers saw the situation as more complex. Were Disney to attempt to forcefully suppress the film, that effort could serve to draw even more attention to it,&lt;ref name="NY Times article" /&gt; a phenomenon known as the [[Streisand effect]].&lt;ref name="Michael Ryan blog post"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ryan|first=Michael|title=Escape From Tomorrow’ and The Air Pirates|url=http://www.soundonsight.org/escape-from-tomorrow-and-the-air-pirates/|publisher=SoundOnSight.org|date=January 23, 2013|accessdate=January 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if Disney were to successfully prevent official distribution, the film could easily be pirated and distributed over the Internet. In his ''Post'' review, Smith suggested that Disney prevent this by taking the opposite course, simply ignoring ''Escape from Tomorrow'' and letting the attention dissipate by itself.&lt;ref name="NY Post review" /&gt;

Michael Ryan, director of [[The YoungCuts Film Festival]], noted that there was a precedent for the film in the [[Air Pirates#Lawsuit|Air Pirates lawsuit]], in which Disney spent eight years in court with some underground cartoonists who had published an [[underground comix]] parody in which [[Mickey Mouse]] and the other Disney characters engaged in explicit sex and used illegal drugs, among other behavior they avoided in Disney's own narratives. He suggested that Disney buy the rights and release the film itself, which it could easily do as its announced interest would guarantee it a [[monopsony]] on the film since no other distributor would want to match Disney's deep pockets or its feared legal response. As a Disney release, ''Escape from Tomorrow'' would have a large potential audience of both Disney enthusiasts and antagonists, Disney would be making money from property it already owns instead of someone else and the company's apparent willingness to go in the joke would take some of the [[satire|satiric]] edge off.&lt;ref name="Michael Ryan blog post" /&gt;

Moore expressed hope that the film could be shown and released, even if it meant a legal battle.
{{quote|It depends on how good a case lawyers can make for it. If they say I have a chance, I'll definitely fight for it. I worked on it really hard for three years and it took a lot out of me. Just to let it disappear would be a waste of time.&lt;ref name="IndieWire interview" /&gt;}} Since the film's release Disney has acknowledged it in another way. The online supplement to ''[[Disney A to Z: The Official Encyclopedia]]'' includes an entry for ''Escape from Tomorrow'', describing it as "An independent surrealistic cult film surreptitiously filmed at Walt Disney World and Disneyland."&lt;ref name="Disney encyclopedia supplement" /&gt;

According to ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', Disney chose to avoid responding to the film altogether, rather than seeking legal action, in an effort to prevent increased publicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Abramovitch|first=Seth|title=Disney's Non-Strategy Strategy to Combat Unauthorized Disneyland Horror Movie|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/escape-tomorrow-disneys-strategy-strategy-630906|accessdate=18 September 2013|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|date=18 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Herzl Award''' is awarded annually by the Department for Zionist Activities of the [[World Zionist Organization]] (WZO) to outstanding young men and women in recognition of their exceptional efforts on behalf of Israel and the Zionist cause. The award was first awarded in 2004, on the centennial anniversary of [[Theodore Herzl]]'s death.

== Background ==
Herzl was the father of political [[Zionism]]. Even though he died at the young age of 44, of which only 9 were dedicated to the Zionist cause, he was able to mobilize the forces and create the infrastructure that would revolutionize the Jewish world and bring about the realization of the Jewish people's age-old dream of returning to Zion.

== Award requirements ==
According to the site of the WZO candidates are nominated by Zionist Federations around the world for achievement in one or more of several fields:
* Encouraging aliyah
* Promoting Zionist education (formal or informal)
* Fostering the study of Hebrew
* Advocating on behalf of Israel 
* Furthering the development of Israel as an exemplary society
* Contributing to the advancement of Zionist thought
* Organizing on behalf of the Zionist movement

Nominees must be no older than 44, Herzl's age at the time of his death.

== Recipients ==
All Herzl Award recipients receive a distinctive certificate and an engraved cast bronze trophy, as well as being inscribed in a special Herzl album in Jerusalem.

[[File:Hans Holbein the Younger - The Ambassadors - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Hans Holbein the Younger|Holbein]]'s ''[[The Ambassadors (Holbein)|The Ambassadors]]'' is a complex work whose iconography remains the subject of debate.]]

'''Iconography''', as a branch of [[art history]], studies the identification, description, and the interpretation of the content of images: the subjects depicted, the particular compositions and details used to do so, and other elements that are distinct from [[artistic style]]. The word ''iconography'' comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|εἰκών}} ("image") and {{lang|grc|γράφειν}} ("to write").

A secondary meaning (based on a non-standard translation of the Greek and Russian equivalent terms) is the production of religious images, called "icons", in the [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Churches|Orthodox Christian]] tradition (see [[Icon]]).

In [[art history]], "an iconography" may also mean a particular depiction of a subject in terms of the content of the image, such as the number of figures used, their placing and gestures.  The term is also used in many academic fields other than art history, for example [[semiotics]] and [[media studies]], and in general usage, for the content of images, the typical depiction in images of a subject, and related senses.  Sometimes distinctions have been made between ''[[iconology]]'' and ''iconography'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195399301/obo-9780195399301-0161.xml Oxford Bibliographies: Paul Taylor, "Iconology and Iconography"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tems.umn.edu/pdf/Panofsky_iconology2.pdf Erwin Panofsky, ''Studies in Iconology: Humanistic Themes in the Art of the Renaissance''. Oxford 1939.]&lt;/ref&gt; although the definitions, and so the distinction made, varies. 
When referring to movies, genres are immediately recognizable through their iconography, motifs that become associated with a specific genre through repetition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Giannetti|first= Louis|title= Understanding Movies|year= 2008|publisher= Person Prentice Hall|location= Toronto|page= 52}}
&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=February 2015}}

==Iconography as a field of study==

=== Foundations of iconography ===
Early Western writers who took special note of the content of images include [[Giorgio Vasari]], whose ''Ragionamenti'', interpreting the paintings in the [[Palazzo Vecchio]] in [[Florence]], reassuringly demonstrates that such works were difficult to understand even for well-informed contemporaries.  [[Gian Pietro Bellori]], a 17th-century biographer of artists of his own time, describes and analyses, not always correctly, many works. [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]]'s study (1796) of the classical figure [[Cupid|Amor]] with an inverted torch was an early attempt to use a study of a type of image to explain the culture it originated in, rather than the other way round.&lt;ref name="Białostocki:535"&gt;Białostocki:535&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Hans Memling 056.jpg|thumb|A painting with complex iconography: [[Hans Memling]]'s so-called [[Seven Joys of the Virgin]] – in fact this is a later title for a ''[[Life of the Virgin]]'' cycle on a single panel.  Altogether 25 scenes, not all involving the Virgin, are depicted. 1480, [[Alte Pinakothek]], Munich.&lt;ref&gt;Alte Pinakotek, Munich; (Summary Catalogue – various authors), pp. 348-51, 1986, Edition Lipp, {{ISBN|3-87490-701-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Iconography as an academic art historical discipline developed in the nineteenth-century in the works of scholars such as [[Adolphe Napoleon Didron]] (1806–1867), [[Anton Heinrich Springer]] (1825–1891), and [[Émile Mâle]] (1862–1954)&lt;ref name="kleinbauer"&gt;W. Eugene Kleinbauer and Thomas P. Slavens, ''Research Guide to the History of Western Art'', Sources of information in the humanities, no. 2. Chicago: [[American Library Association]] (1982): 60-72.&lt;/ref&gt; all specialists in Christian religious art, which was the main focus of study in this period, in which French scholars were especially prominent.&lt;ref name="Białostocki:535"/&gt;  They looked back to earlier attempts to classify and organise subjects encyclopedically like [[Cesare Ripa]]'s ''Iconologia overo Descrittione Dell’imagini Universali cavate dall’Antichità et da altri luoghi '' and [[Anne Claude Philippe de Tubieres de Grimoard de Pestels de Levis, Comte de Caylus|Anne Claude Philippe de Caylus]]'s ''Recueil d'antiquités égyptiennes, étrusques, grècques, romaines et gauloises'' as guides to understanding works of art, both religious and profane, in a more scientific manner than the popular [[aesthetic]] approach of the time.&lt;ref name="kleinbauer" /&gt; These early contributions paved the way for [[encyclopedia]]s, manuals, and other publications useful in identifying the content of art.  Mâle's  ''l'Art religieux du XIIIe siècle en France'' (originally 1899, with revised editions) translated into English as ''The Gothic Image, Religious Art in France of the Thirteenth Century'' has remained continuously in print.

=== Twentieth-century iconography ===
In the early-twentieth century [[Germany]], [[Aby Warburg]] (1866–1929) and his followers [[Fritz Saxl]] (1890–1948) and [[Erwin Panofsky]] (1892–1968) elaborated the practice of identification and classification of motifs in images to using iconography as a means to understanding meaning.&lt;ref name="kleinbauer" /&gt; Panofsky codified an influential approach to iconography in his 1939 ''Studies in Iconology'', where he defined it as "the branch of the history of art which concerns itself with the subject matter or meaning of works of art, as opposed to form,"&lt;ref name="kleinbauer" /&gt; although the distinction he and other scholars drew between particular definitions of "iconography" (put simply, the identification of visual content) and "iconology" (the analysis of the meaning of that content), has not been generally accepted, though it is still used by some writers.&lt;ref&gt;For example by [[Anne D'Alleva]] in her ''Methods and Theories of Art History'', pp. 20-28, 2005, Laurence King Publishing, {{ISBN|1-85669-417-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], to which Panofsky immigrated in 1931, students such as [[Frederick Hartt]], and [[Meyer Schapiro]] continued under his influence in the discipline.&lt;ref name="kleinbauer" /&gt;  In an influential article of 1942, ''Introduction to an "Iconography of Mediaeval Architecture"'',&lt;ref&gt;Richard Krautheimer,Introduction to an "Iconography of Mediaeval Architecture", Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes, Vol. 5. (1942), pp. 1-33.[http://aar.iec.cat/institucio/societats/AmicsArtRomanic/activitats/textosesp/espanol04.pdf Online text] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408194332/http://aar.iec.cat/institucio/societats/AmicsArtRomanic/activitats/textosesp/espanol04.pdf |date=April 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Krautheimer]], a specialist on early medieval churches and another German émigré, extended iconographical analysis to [[architecture|architectural forms]].

The period from 1940 can be seen as one where iconography was especially prominent in art history.&lt;ref&gt;Białostocki:537&lt;/ref&gt;  Whereas most icongraphical scholarship remains highly dense and specialized, some analyses began to attract a much wider audience, for example [[Erwin Panofsky|Panofsky]]'s theory (now generally out of favour with specialists) that the writing on the rear wall in the ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'' by [[Jan van Eyck]] turned the painting into the record of a marriage contract.  [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Holbein]]'s ''[[The Ambassadors (Holbein)|The Ambassadors]]'' has been the subject of books for a general market with new theories as to its iconography,&lt;ref&gt;Most recently: North, John (September, 2004). The Ambassador's Secret: Holbein and the World of the Renaissance. Orion Books&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[best-seller]]s of [[Dan Brown]] include theories, disowned by most art historians, on the iconography of works by [[Leonardo da Vinci]].

Technological advances allowed the building-up of huge collections of photographs, with an iconographic arrangement or index, which include those of the [[Warburg Institute]] and the ''Index of Christian Art'' at [[Princeton University|Princeton]] (which has made a specialism of iconography since its early days in America).&lt;ref&gt;Białostocki:538-39&lt;/ref&gt; These are now being digitised and made available online, usually on a restricted basis.
 
With the arrival of computing, the [[Iconclass]] system, a highly complex way of classifying the content of images, with 28,000 classification types, and 14,000 keywords, was developed in the Netherlands as a standard classification for recording collections, with the idea of assembling huge databases that will allow the retrieval of images featuring particular details, subjects or other common factors.  For example, the Iconclass code "71H7131" is for the subject of "[[Bathsheba]] (alone) with David's letter", whereas "71" is the whole "[[Old Testament]]" and "71H" the "story of [[David]]".   A number of collections of different types have been classified using Iconclass, notably many types of [[old master print]], the collections of the [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin]] and the German [[Marburger Index]].  These are available, usually on-line or on [[DVD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iconclass.nl/ |title=Iconclass website |publisher=Iconclass.nl |date= |accessdate=2014-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kb.nl/manuscripts/browser/index.html Illuminated manuscripts from the Dutch royal Library, browsable by ICONCLASS classification] and [http://www.rosspub.com/iconclass.htm Ross Publishing - examples of databases for sale] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080220200839/http://www.kb.nl/manuscripts/browser/index.html |date=February 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The system can also be used outside pure art history, for example on sites like [[Flickr]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iconclass.org/flickr website Iconclass for Flickr]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Iconography in religious art ===
[[Religious images]] are used to some extent by all major religions, including both [[Indian religions|Indian]] and [[Abrahamic religion|Abrahamic]] faiths, and often contain highly complex iconography, which reflects centuries of accumulated tradition.

=== Iconography in Indian religious art ===
Central to the iconography and [[hagiography]] of [[Indian religions]] are [[mudra]] or gestures with specific meanings.  Other features include the [[aureola]] and [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]], also found in Christian and Islamic art, and divine qualities and attributes represented by [[asana]] and ritual tools such as the [[dharmachakra]], [[vajra]], [[dadar]], [[chhatra]], [[sauwastika]], [[phurba]] and [[danda]].  The symbolic use of colour to denote the [[Classical Elements]] or [[Mahabhuta]] and letters and [[Bīja|bija]] syllables from sacred alphabetic scripts are other features.  Under the influence of [[tantra]] art developed esoteric meanings, accessible only to initiates; this is an especially strong feature of [[Tibetan art]]. The art of Indian Religions esp. Hindus in its numerous sectoral divisions is governed by sacred texts called the [[Aagama]] which describes the ratio and proportion of the icon, called ''taalmaana'' as well as mood of the central figure in a context. For example, [[Narasimha]] an incarnation of [[Vishnu]] though considered a wrathful deity but in few contexts is depicted in pacified mood.

Although iconic depictions of, or concentrating on, a single figure are the dominant type of [[Buddhist]] image, large stone [[bas-relief|relief]] or [[fresco]] narrative cycles of the ''Life of the Buddha'', or tales of his previous lives, are found at major sites like [[Sarnath]], [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]], and [[Borobudor]], especially in earlier periods.  Conversely, in [[Hindu]] art, narrative scenes have become rather more common in recent centuries, especially in [[Indian miniature painting|miniature paintings]] of the lives of [[Krishna]] and [[Rama]].

=== Christian iconography ===
{{further|Christian art| Eastern Orthodox iconography|Marian art in the Catholic Church}}
After an early period when [[Aniconism in Christianity|aniconism was strong]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernst Kitzinger|Kitzinger, Ernst]], "The Cult of Images in the Age before Iconoclasm", ''Dumbarton Oaks Papers'', Vol. 8, (1954), pp.&amp;nbsp;83–150, Dumbarton Oaks, Trustees for Harvard University, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1291064 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; surviving [[Early Christian art]] began, about two centuries after Christ, with small images in the [[Catacombs of Rome]] that show [[orans]] figures, portraits of Christ and some saints, and a limited number of "abbreviated representations" of biblical episodes emphasizing deliverance.  From the Constantinian period monumental art borrowed motifs from Roman Imperial imagery, classical Greek and Roman religion and popular art – the motif of [[Christ in Majesty]] owes something to both Imperial portraits and depictions of [[Zeus]].  In the [[Late Antique]] period iconography began to be standardised, and to relate more closely to [[Biblical]] texts, although many gaps in the [[canonical Gospel]] narratives were plugged with matter from the [[apocrypha|apocryphal gospels]].  Eventually the Church would succeed in weeding most of these out, but some remain, like the ox and ass in the [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity of Christ]].
[[File:Tikhvinskaya.jpg|thumb|The Theotokos of [[Tikhvin]] of ca. 1300, an example of the [[Hodegetria]] type of [[Madonna and Child]].]]
After the [[Iconoclasm (Byzantine)|period of Byzantine iconoclasm]] iconographical innovation was regarded as unhealthy, if not heretical, in the Eastern Church, though it still continued at a glacial pace.  More than in the West, traditional depictions were often considered to have authentic or [[Acheiropoieta|miraculous origins]], and the job of the artist was to copy them with as little deviation as possible. The Eastern church also never accepted the use of monumental [[high relief]] or free-standing sculpture, which it found too reminiscent of paganism.  Most modern [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[icon]]s are very close to their predecessors of a thousand years ago, though development, and some shifts in meaning, have occurred – for example the old man wearing a fleece in conversation with [[Saint Joseph]] usually seen in Orthodox Nativities seems to have begun as one of the shepherds, or the prophet [[Isaiah]], but is now usually understood as the "Tempter" ([[Satan]]).&lt;ref&gt;Schiller:66&lt;/ref&gt;

In both East and West, numerous iconic types of [[Christ]], [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and saints and other subjects were developed; the number of named types of icons of Mary, with or without the infant Christ, was especially large in the East, whereas [[Christ Pantocrator]] was much the commonest image of Christ.  Especially important depictions of Mary include the [[Hodegetria]] and  [[Panagia]] types.  Traditional models evolved for narrative paintings, including large cycles covering the events of the Life of Christ, the [[Life of the Virgin]], parts of the Old Testament, and, increasingly, the lives of popular [[saint]]s.  Especially in the West, a system of [[emblem|attributes]] developed for [[Saint symbology|identifying individual]] figures of saints by a standard appearance and symbolic objects held by them; in the East they were more likely to identified by text labels.

From the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] period sculpture on churches became increasingly important in Western art, and probably partly because of the lack of Byzantine models, became the location of much iconographic innovation, along with the [[illuminated manuscript]], which had already taken a decisively different direction from Byzantine equivalents, under the influence of [[Insular art]] and other factors.  Developments in theology and devotional practice produced innovations like the subject of the [[Coronation of the Virgin]] and the [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]], both associated with the [[Franciscan]]s, as were many other developments. Most painters remained content to copy and slightly modify the works of others, and it is clear that the clergy, by whom or for whose churches most art was commissioned, often specified what they wanted shown in great detail.

The theory of [[Typology (theology)|typology]], by which the meaning of most events of the [[Old Testament]] was understood as a "type" or pre-figuring of an event in the life of, or aspect of, Christ or Mary was often reflected in art, and in the later [[Middle Ages]] came to dominate the choice of Old Testament scenes in Western Christian art.
[[File:Robert Campin - L' Annonciation - 1425.jpg|thumb|[[Robert Campin]]'s [[Mérode Altarpiece]] of 1425-28 has a highly complex iconography that is still debated.  Is [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]] making a mousetrap, reflecting a remark of Saint [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] that Christ's Incarnation was a trap to catch men's souls?]] 
Whereas in the Romanesque and [[Gothic art|Gothic]] periods the great majority of religious art was intended to convey often complex religious messages as clearly as possible, with the arrival of [[Early Netherlandish painting]] iconography became highly sophisticated, and in many cases appears to be deliberately enigmatic, even for a well-educated contemporary. The subtle layers of meaning uncovered by modern iconographical research in works of [[Robert Campin]] such as the [[Mérode Altarpiece]], and of Jan van Eyck such as the [[Madonna of Chancellor Rolin]] and the [[Annunciation (van Eyck, Washington)|Washington Annunciation]] lie in small details of what are on first viewing very conventional representations.  When Italian painting developed a taste for enigma, considerably later, it most often showed in secular compositions influenced by [[Platonism in the Renaissance|Renaissance Neo-Platonism]].

From the 15th century religious painting gradually freed itself from the habit of following earlier compositional models, and by the 16th century ambitious artists were expected to find novel compositions for each subject, and direct borrowings from earlier artists are more often of the poses of individual figures than of whole compositions.  The [[The Reformation and art|Reformation]] soon restricted most [[Protestant]] religious painting to Biblical scenes conceived along the lines of [[history painting]], and after some decades the Catholic [[Council of Trent]] reined in somewhat the freedom of Catholic artists.

=== Secular Western painting ===
Secular painting became far more common from the Renaissance, and developed its own traditions and conventions of iconography, in [[history painting]], which includes [[mythology|mythologies]], [[portrait painting|portraits]], [[genre painting|genre scenes]], and even [[landscape painting|landscapes]], not to mention modern media and genres like [[photography]], [[Film|cinema]], [[political cartoon]]s, [[comic book]]s and [[anime]].

Renaissance mythological painting was in theory reviving the iconography of the ancient world, but in practice themes like [[Leda and the Swan]] developed on largely original lines, and for different purposes.  Personal iconographies, where works appear to have significant meanings individual to, and perhaps only accessible by, the artist, go back at least as far as [[Hieronymous Bosch]], but have become increasingly significant with artists like [[Goya]], [[William Blake]], [[Paul Gauguin|Gauguin]], [[Picasso]], [[Frida Kahlo]] and [[Joseph Beuys]].

== Iconography in disciplines other than art history{{anchor|iconography and popular culture}} ==
Iconography, often of aspects of [[popular culture]], is a concern of other [[academic disciplines]] including [[Semiotics]], [[Anthropology]], [[Sociology]], [[Media Studies]] and [[Cultural Studies]].  These analyses in turn have affected conventional art history, especially concepts such as [[sign (semiotics)|signs in semiotics]].  Discussing imagery as iconography in this way implies a critical "reading" of imagery that often attempts to explore social and cultural values. Iconography is also used within [[Film theory|film studies]] to describe the [[visual language]] of cinema, particularly within the field of [[Film genre|genre criticism]].&lt;ref name="film"&gt;Cook and Bernink (1999, 138-140).&lt;/ref&gt; In the age of Internet, the new global history of the visual production of Humanity (Histiconologia &lt;ref&gt;The first World Dictionary of Images: Laurent Gervereau (ed.), "Dictionnaire mondial des images", Paris, Nouveau monde, 2006, 1120p, {{ISBN|978-2-84736-185-8}}. (with 275 specialists from all continents, all specialities, all periods from Prehistory to nowadays) ; Laurent Gervereau, "Images, une histoire mondiale", Paris, Nouveau monde, 2008, 272p., {{ISBN|978-2-84736-362-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;) includes History of Art and history of all kind of images or medias.

The '''''Iron Mountain''''' was a [[stern-wheeler]] that plied the [[Mississippi River]] for ten years until sinking in 1882. Built in 1872 on the [[Ohio River]] at [[Pittsburgh]], the boat was {{Convert|181|ft|m}} long and had a {{Convert|35|ft|m}} beam.&lt;ref name="perdurabo10"/&gt; The ship ran aground and sank in 1882. However, a common legend claims that it mysteriously disappeared.

==Sinking==

The ''Iron Mountain'' sailed from Vicksburg on March 25, 1882, and hit an obstruction at Stumpy Point, near Island 102, which holed her hull and sank her. The crew scrambled onto one of the barges and escaped. A chambermaid/ship stewardness named Mrs. Ellen Anderson&lt;ref&gt;[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83016632/1882-04-01/ed-1/seq-2/#date1=03%2F28%2F1882&amp;index=1&amp;rows=20&amp;searchType=advanced&amp;language=&amp;sequence=0&amp;words=Iron+Mountain+towboat&amp;proxdistance=5&amp;date2=04%2F31%2F1882&amp;ortext=&amp;proxtext=towboat+Iron+Mountain&amp;phrasetext=&amp;andtext=&amp;dateFilterType=range&amp;page=1  The Weekly Louisianian., April 01, 1882, Image 2]&lt;/ref&gt; was caught below decks and killed. Her body was recovered the next day with some wreckage, but of the ship itself there was no sign. Further wreckage was found on June 30, several miles from where the boat was lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Colby |first1=C.

==Legend==

A common legend claims that it was travelling from [[New Orleans]] to [[Pittsburgh]], loaded with cotton and sugar, when it disappeared. It sailed from [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]], and headed north, towing a string of barges and with 55 crew and passengers aboard. Another steamer, the ''[[Iroquois Chief]]'', found the ''Iron Mountain''{{'}}s barges floating downriver, apparently having been cut loose, but the ship itself had vanished.

This legend is often repeated as fact, as in [[Frank Edwards (writer and broadcaster)|Frank Edward's]] 1956 book, ''Strangest of All'', Paul Begg's ''Into Thin Air'' (1979), the [[Reader's Digest]]'s ''Mysteries of the Unexplained'' (1982),  [[Louis L'Amour]]'s ''[[The Haunted Mesa]]'' (1987), and [[Charles Berlitz]]'s ''World of Strange Phenomena'' (1988). Most versions of the story give the date of the "disappearance" as 1872, which was in fact the date of the ships launching.&lt;ref name="apmagazine"/&gt;

'''Khor Shingawi''' is an archaeological site in [[Sudan]]. It is situated about {{convert|12.5|km}} from the [[Nile]] to the south of the [[Merowe Dam]]. It includes the remains of a palatial building, probably dating to 500 to 1500 AD. Its former role and exact date remains unknown. The building is largely isolated, rectangular in shape, and built of stone. It is divided into three parts, with about 20 rooms and corridors that are located on two levels. The centerpiece is a courtyard with a ramp that leads up to a podium.

A '''lavalava''', also known as an '''''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'ie''''', short for 'ie lavalava, is an article of daily clothing traditionally worn by [[Polynesia]]ns and other [[Oceania|Oceanic]] peoples. It consists of a single rectangular cloth worn as a [[skirt]].&lt;ref&gt;Rhone, Rosamond Dobson. [https://books.google.com/books?id=rOopZNh3CYAC&amp;pg=RA2-PA583&amp;dq=%22Lava+lava%22+clothing&amp;lr=&amp;ei=A_bcSK75L5KQzQSnp8DFDQ "Nauru, the Richest Island in the South Seas"], ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' vol. 40, No. 1, 1924, pp. 559–590.&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''lavalava'' is both singular and plural in the [[Samoan language]].

==Customary use==
Today the fashion remains common in [[Samoa]], [[American Samoa]], [[Tonga]] and parts of [[Melanesia]] and [[Micronesia]]. It is worn by men and women in uses from school uniforms to business attire with a suit jacket and tie. Many people of Oceanic ethnicity wear the ''lavalava'' as an expression of cultural identity and for comfort within expatriate communities, especially in the [[United States]] (notably [[Hawaii]], [[Alaska]], [[California]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], and [[Utah]]), [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]].

==Attire==
The ''lavalava'' is secured around the waist by an overhand knotting of the upper corners of the cloth; women often tuck the loose ends into the waistband, while men usually allow them to hang in front. Women generally wear ankle-length ''lavalava'' while men's wraps often extend to the knee or mid-calf depending on the activity or occasion.

==History==
Prior to the arrival of Europeans in the Pacific Ocean, the most prestigious ''lavalava'' were made by wrapping the body in a ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'ie toga'' with fine mats (finely woven textiles of [[pandanus]] leaves) or ''siapo'' ([[tapa cloth]]) pounded from [[paper mulberry]] or wild [[hibiscus]] bark. The Samoans also created ''lavalava'' from traditional materials such as flower petals, leaves, feathers and seashells tied to a wrap-around backing of plaited plant fibers.

[[Calico (textile)|Calico]] and loomed [[cotton]] cloth had largely replaced woven or barkcloth ''lavalava'' as articles of daily use (though ''ie toga'' and ''siapo'' wraps are still used today for ceremonial and festive occasions and dance performances). Samoan men who bear the ''[[pe'a]]'' body tattoo, as well as Samoan women who bear the ''[[malu]]'' leg tattoos often roll the waistband of the ''lavalava'' or tuck in the sides and rear portion(s) of the ''lavalava'' to expose their tattoo during dance performances or ceremonial functions (such as 'ava ceremonies), a style referred to as ''agini''.

==Current forms==
Specially tailored linen ''lavalava'' which extend mid-calf, often with pockets and ties/buckles, are worn by men at special occasions or to church; these are always solid colors (in contrast to the bright patterns of everyday ''lava-lava'') and are known as ''sulu'' ([[Fijian language|Fijian]]), ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'ie faitaga'' (Samoan), or ''[[tupenu]]'' ([[Tongan language|Tongan]]). Similar ankle-length skirts form the lower half of the two-piece formal dress worn by Samoan and Tongan women (called ''[[puletasi]]'' and ''puletaha'', respectively). On special occasions the Tongan ''tupenu'' and ''puletaha'' are usually associated with a tapa cloth or waist-mat called ''[[ta'ovala]]'' and some Samoans still wear a tapa cloth ''vala'' sash in similar fashion (though the ''vala'' is generally restricted to ceremonial/festive regalia of orators or people acting/dressing as ''taupou'' maidens and ''manaia'' beaus). The formal, tailored linen ''lavalava'' styles of Tonga, Samoa, and Fiji originated with the Fijian noble Ratu Sir [[Lala Sukuna]] who introduced the buckled ''sulu'' to Fiji in 1920 following his military service and university education in Europe.

Loudly colored ''lavalava'' made from materials such as [[satin]], [[velvet]], [[polyester]], and [[sequins]] have recently been popularized among performance dance groups and village, church, or school-based choirs.

[[File:Samoa Familie.JPG|thumb|Samoan family.]]

==Related names and garments==
In English, such garments are generically called [[sarong]], but that word is actually [[Malay language|Malay]], whereas ''lavalava'' is Samoan, being short for ''ʻie lavalava'' (cloth that wraps around). Another common name for the Polynesian variety is ''pāreu'' (usually spelled ''[[pareo]]''), which is the [[Tahitian language|Tahitian]] name.&lt;ref&gt;Ullman, James Ramsey. ''Fia Fia: A Novel of the South Pacific''. World Pub. Co., 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[New Caledonia]] and [[Wallis and Futuna]], lavalava are called "''manou''". A similar simple kind of clothing is the ''[[lap-lap]]'' worn in [[Papua New Guinea]] and the [[Oceania|South Pacific]], which is completely open at both sides.

'''Law and corpus linguistics''' ('''LCL''') is a new academic sub-discipline that uses large databases of examples of language usage equipped with tools designed by linguists called [[Text corpus|corpora]] to better get at the meaning of words and phrases in legal texts (statutes, constitutions, contracts, etc.).{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Thus, LCL is the application of [[Corpus linguistics|corpus linguistic]] tools, theories, and methodologies to issues of legal interpretation in much the same way [[law and economics]] is the application of economic tools, theories, and methodologies to various legal issues.

== History ==
A 2005 law review article by Lawrence Solan noted in passing that corpus linguistics had potential for its application to interpreting legal texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Solan|first=Lawrence M.|year=2005|title=The New Textualists' New Text|ssrn=719786|journal=Loyola of L.A. Law Rev.|volume=38|pages=2027–2062|via=SSRN}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the first systematic exploration and advocacy of applying the tools and methodologies of corpus linguistics to legal interpretive questions of law and corpus linguistics came in the fall of 2010, when the [[BYU Law Review]] published a note by Stephen Mouritsen, entitled ''The Dictionary is Not a Fortress: Definitional Fallacies and a Corpus-Based Approach to Plain Meaning''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=C.|first=Mouritsen, Stephen|date=2010-01-01|title=The Dictionary Is Not a Fortress: Definitional Fallacies and a Corpus-Based Approach to Plain Meaning|url=http://digitalcommons.law.byu.edu/lawreview/vol2010/iss5/10/|journal=BYU Law Review|volume=2010|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The note argued that dictionaries are the primary linguistic tool used by judges to determine the plain or ordinary meaning of words and phrases, and highlighted the deficiencies of such an approach. In its stead, the note proposed using corpus linguistics. And the note would be later cited by [[Adam Liptak]] in a ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' article on statutory construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/14/us/14bar.html|title=Justices Turning More Frequently to Dictionary, and Not Just for Big Words|last=Liptak|first=Adam|date=2011-06-13|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Law and corpus linguistics (LCL) gained greater legitimacy in July 2011 with the first judicial opinion in American history utilizing corpus linguistics to determine the meaning of a legal text: ''In re the Adoption of Baby E.Z.''&lt;ref name="courts"&gt;266 P.3d (Utah 2011). Available at https://www.utcourts.gov/opinions/supopin/InReEZ071911.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|702}} In a concurrence in part and in the judgment, [[Thomas Rex Lee|Justice Thomas Lee]] wrote to put forth an alternative ground for the majority's holding—interpreting the phrase "custody determination" by using corpus linguistics. Justice Lee looked at 500 randomized sample sentences from the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA) and found that the most common sense of "custody" was in the context of divorce rather than adoption.&lt;ref name="courts"/&gt;{{rp|724}} Further, he found that "custody" is ten times more likely to co-occur (or collocate) with "divorce" than with "adoption".&lt;ref name="courts"/&gt;{{rp|724}} From that evidence Justice Lee concluded that he "would find that the custody proceedings covered by the Act are limited to proceedings resulting in the modifiable custody orders of a divorce", rather than the broader range of custody proceedings.&lt;ref name="courts"/&gt;{{rp|725}}

Other jurisprudence and scholarship would follow. In a 2015 concurrence in ''State v. Rasabout'', Justice Lee used a COCA search to determine that "discharge" when used with a firearm (or one of its synonyms) overwhelmingly referred to a single shot rather than emptying the entire magazine of the weapon.&lt;ref&gt;356 P.3d 1258, 1281–1282 (Utah 2015) (Lee, J., concurring). Available at https://www.utcourts.gov/opinions/supopin/State%20v.%20Rasabout20150814.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; And in 2016, four of the five justices joined a footnote in a majority opinion by Justice Lee commending a party for using corpus linguistics in its briefing even though the Court found it unnecessary to resolve the related question.&lt;ref&gt;''Craig v. Provo'', 2016 WL 4506309, 2016 UT 40, para. 26 n.3. Available at https://www.utcourts.gov/opinions/supopin/Craig%20v.%20Provo%20City20160826.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in 2016 the [[Michigan Supreme Court]] became the first court to use a linguist-designed corpus in a majority opinion (COCA), with both the majority and the dissent turning to COCA to determine the meaning of the word "information".&lt;ref&gt;''People v. Harris'', 2016 WL 3449466, 499 Mich. 332. Available at https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12254447053873886358&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,33&amp;sciodt=6,33#r[31]&lt;/ref&gt;

As to scholarship, in 2012, Mouritsen followed up his original work with an article in the Columbia Science and Technology Law Review, where he further refined and promoted the use of corpus-based methods for determining questions of legal ambiguity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stlr.org/volumes/volume-xiii-2011-2012/hard-cases-and-hard-data-assessing-corpus-linguistics-as-an-empirical-paths-to-plain-meaning/|title=Hard Cases and Hard Data: Assessing Corpus Linguistics as an Empirical Path to Plain Meaning – Columbia Science and Technology Law Review|website=stlr.org|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in 2016 two essays and an article on law and corpus linguistics were published. The Yale Law Journal Forum published ''Corpus Linguistics &amp; Original Public Meaning: A New Tool to Make Originalism More Empirical''. Written by Justice Lee and two co-authors, the essay urged originalists to turn to corpus linguistics to improve the rigor and accuracy of originalist scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yalelawjournal.org/forum/corpus-linguistics-original-public-meaning&lt;/ref&gt; And in response, the Forum published an essay by Lawrence Solan (a Brooklyn Law professor with a PhD in linguistics), ''Can Corpus Linguistics Help Make Originalism Scientific?''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yalelawjournal.org/pdf/Solanforwebsitepdf_tryz9ksn.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Boston University Public Interest Law Journal published ''The Merciful Corpus: The Rule of Lenity, Ambiguity and Corpus Linguistics'' by Daniel Ortner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ortner|first=Daniel|date=2014-12-01|title=The Merciful Corpus: The Rule of Lenity, Ambiguity and Corpus Linguistics|ssrn=2576475|location=Rochester, NY|publisher=Social Science Research Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the article Ortner applied corpus linguistics to determining whether sufficient ambiguity exists to trigger the rule of lenity in five Supreme Court cases. Looking forward, in 2017 two more articles are slated for publication. Lee Strang focuses on corpus linguistics and originalism in the U.C. Davis Law Review,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Strang|first=Lee J.|date=2016-09-07|title=How Big Data Can Increase Originalism's Methodological Rigor: Using Corpus Linguistics to Reveal Original Language Conventions|ssrn=2665131|location=Rochester, NY|publisher=Social Science Research Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Lawrence Solan and Tammy Gales explore corpus linguistics in the context of finding ordinary meaning in statutory interpretation in the International Journal of Legal Discourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Solan|first=Lawrence M.|last2=Gales|first2=Tammy A.|date=2016-10-10|title=Finding Ordinary Meaning in Law: The Judge, the Dictionary or the Corpus?|ssrn=2850703|location=Rochester, NY|publisher=Social Science Research Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawyers and journalists have also taken notice of corpus linguistics at it relates to the law. In 2010, Neal Goldfarb filed the first known brief in the Supreme Court using corpus linguistics (COCA) to determine whether the ordinary meaning of "personal" referred to corporations in the case ''[[FCC v. AT&amp;T Inc.|FCC v. AT&amp;T]]''. The amicus brief looked at the top collocates (words that co-occur) of "personal" in COHA as well as BYU's Time Magazine Corpus.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publishing/preview/publiced_preview_briefs_pdfs_09_10_09_1279_PetitionerAmCuPOGO_BrechnerCtr_andTaxAnalystsnew.authcheckdam.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; And writing for [[The Atlantic]], [[Ben Zimmer]] took note of this new trend, referring to corpus linguistics in the courts as "Like Lexis on Steroids".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2011/03/the-corpus-in-the-court-like-lexis-on-steroids/72054/|title=The Corpus in the Court: 'Like Lexis on Steroids'|last=Zimmer|first=Ben|newspaper=The Atlantic|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the academic front, in 2013 BYU Law School started the first class on law and corpus linguistics, co-taught by Mouritsen, Lee, and (now Dean) [[D. Gordon Smith|Gordon Smith]]. The class is currently in its fourth year. And in February 2016, BYU Law School hosted the inaugural conference on LCL, with over two dozen legal and linguistic scholars from around the country discussing and debating the next steps forward for the growing academic movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lawcorpus.byu.edu/ See "Conference Attendees" and "Conference Schedule"]&lt;/ref&gt; A second conference is scheduled for February 2017. At the conference BYU Law School announced its plans and progress on the Corpus of Founding Era American English (COFEA), a corpus that will cover 1760–1799.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lawcorpus.byu.edu/ See "Current Projects"]&lt;/ref&gt; To date 120 million words have been collected from founding era letters, diaries, newspapers, non-fiction books, fiction, sermons, speeches, debates, legal cases, and other legal materials.

'''Angus "Mac" MacGyver''' is the [[title character]] and the [[protagonist]] in the TV series ''MacGyver''. He is played by [[Richard Dean Anderson]] in the [[MacGyver_(1985_TV_series)|1985 original series]]. [[Lucas Till]] portrays a younger version of MacGyver in [[MacGyver (2016 TV series)|the 2016 reboot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/macgyver-lucas-till-cast-cbs-pilot-1201735332/|title=CBS Finds New ‘MacGyver’ in ‘X-Men’ Star Lucas Till|last=Wagmeister|first=Elizabeth|date=2016-03-21|work=Variety|access-date=2017-07-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In both portrayals MacGyver is shown to possess a [[Genius|genius]]-level [[Intellect|intellect]]; proficiency in multiple languages; superb [[engineering]] skills; excellent knowledge of [[applied physics]]; military training in [[bomb disposal]] techniques and a preference for non-lethal resolutions to conflicts. MacGyver works for the fictional ''[[Phoenix Foundation (MacGyver)|Phoenix Foundation]]'' in [[Los Angeles]], although in the original series it was an independent [[think-tank]], and in the 2016 reboot it is a clandestine government organization using the cover of a think-tank. In addition to his scientific knowledge and inventive use of common items, he always [[#MacGyver's gear|carries]] a [[Swiss Army knife]] and refuses to carry a [[gun]].

===Personality===
The character is portrayed as a non-violent problem solver and typically eschews the use of guns.&lt;ref&gt;In the first episode "[[Pilot (MacGyver episode)|Pilot]]", MacGyver fires an [[AK-47]] at some Russian soldiers. This episode was before his dislike of firearms was established.&lt;/ref&gt; Even in cases where he must resort to physical violence, or when his improvised devices are used to attack hostile opponents, he is always doing so in [[Self-defense (United States)|self-defense]] and, if possible, subduing or disabling rather than killing. 

MacGyver is passionate about social causes, having on several occasions volunteered to help the less-privileged, showing a particular affinity for - and connection with - children. For example, he is shown to be a "big brother",&lt;ref&gt;Season 1, Episode 1 – "Pilot"&lt;/ref&gt; conducts hearing research at a school for deaf children,&lt;ref&gt;Season 2, Episode 9 – "[http://www.tv.com/macgyver/silent-world/episode/47234/summary.html Silent World]". He works with the ''Phoenix Foundation's'' research into sound and hearing technology.&lt;/ref&gt; and helps out in a mountain excursion for delinquent youths.&lt;ref&gt;Season 2, Episode 5 – "[http://www.tv.com/macgyver/final-approach/episode/47230/summary.html Final Approach]"&lt;/ref&gt; He strives to protect the environment and endangered species such as eagles,&lt;ref&gt;Season 2, Episode 8 – "[http://www.tv.com/shows/macgyver/eagles-47233/ Eagles]"&lt;/ref&gt; the [[black rhino]],&lt;ref&gt;Season 5, Episode 8 – "[http://www.tv.com/shows/macgyver/black-rhino-47290/ Black Rhino]"&lt;/ref&gt; and wolves.&lt;ref&gt;Season 6, Episode 18 – "[http://www.tv.com/shows/macgyver/faith-hope-and-charity-47318/ Faith, Hope &amp; Charity]"&lt;/ref&gt; It was also established that he became a vegetarian at an unspecified date during the series run.&lt;ref&gt;Season 7, Episode 6  – "[http://www.tv.com/shows/macgyver/walking-dead-47324/ Walking Dead]"&lt;/ref&gt;

MacGyver's persistence and the improvisational nature of his plans make him difficult to thwart, as his nemesis [[Murdoc]] pointed out, because not even MacGyver himself knows what he is going to do next. Unlike stereotypical "macho" or stoic action heroes, MacGyver exhibits grief in the face of tragedies, open fear in perilous situations, and shows pain after a fight.&lt;ref&gt;Season 5, Episode 14 – "[http://www.tv.com/shows/macgyver/log-jam-47296/ Log Jam]"&lt;/ref&gt; A sensitive character, Mac has a tendency to blame himself for personal losses and tragedies, like his bad conscience for not being at his mother's deathbed and funeral when he was on a mission in Afghanistan and experiencing a bout of depression after a fatal climbing accident. He also appears to be susceptible to remote temporal [[retrograde amnesia]], which he has experienced more than once after physical head trauma.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

MacGyver's most used item is his [[Swiss Army Knife]]. In addition to it, MacGyver often carries a roll of duct tape in his back pocket, flattened out to make it fit. Other items he often has on hand are: an ID card, a [[Timex Group USA|Timex]] Camper watch, strike-anywhere matches, a few paper clips, chewing gum, and a flashlight. It was shown that he also carried a toolbox in his [[Jeep]].&lt;ref&gt;Season 1, Episode 18 – "[[Ugly Duckling (MacGyver Episode)|Ugly Duckling]]"&lt;/ref&gt; MacGyver initially used a [[Jeep Cherokee]] and then a [[Jeep Wrangler]] beginning with Season 2, but in Season 5 he began driving his grandfather Harry's "classic" 1946 [[Chevrolet]] pickup truck.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=The Black Corsage|series=''MacGyver''|network=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|date=October 1989|season=5|number=3|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MacGyver is proficient to a greater or lesser extent in [[Russian language|Russian]], [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]],&lt;ref&gt;Season 2, Episode 15 – "[http://www.tv.com/shows/macgyver/pirates-47240/ Pirates]"&lt;/ref&gt; and [[American Sign Language]], and knows how to use [[International maritime signal flags]] and [[Morse code]].&lt;ref&gt;Season 3, Episode 8 – "[[The Widowmaker (MacGyver episode)|The Widowmaker]]"&lt;/ref&gt; He is an avid outdoorsman with skills including [[skiing]] and outdoor survivalism.  Despite an acute fear of heights, he is highly skilled at mountain / rock climbing, hang gliding, and parachuting - static line and ripcord / [[High-altitude military parachuting|HALO]]. His other hobbies include ice hockey, racing, and has shown an interest in the arts of painting and guitar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=The Madonna|series=''MacGyver''|network=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|date=December 1989|season=5|number=11|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His haircut is a [[Mullet (haircut)|mullet]], in a clean-cut, lightly gelled variation on the classic hairstyle.

While never being in a long-term on-screen relationship, he has relationships with several women in individual episodes and several previous relationships are hinted at in flashbacks. He is always shown to be on good terms with his past romantic acquaintances.

=== First name ===
MacGyver's first name was originally intended to be Stacey, as seen in a press release from Paramount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.stackexchange.com/questions/5723/why-was-macgyvers-first-name-kept-a-mystery |title=Why was MacGyver's first name kept a mystery?|website=Movies.stackexchange.com |date= |accessdate=July 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it was never confirmed in any episode, and remained a mystery until the seventh season; whenever he is asked about it, he says he dislikes his first name and quickly changes the subject. His grandfather, Harry Jackson, calls him "Bud" or "Buddy".  Most of his friends and colleagues call him by his last name MacGyver or simply "Mac". In the final season his first name is canonically revealed to be Angus when, while knocked unconscious and hallucinating, he meets a 7th-century man named [[Angus (given name)|Angus]] M'Iver ("son of Ingmarr") and admits that they share their first name. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Good Knight, MacGyver|series=''MacGyver''|network=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|date=Nov 1991|season=7|number=8|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; This revelation is repeated in the series finale, which introduces MacGyver's son as having the middle name Angus, as well as on the packaging of the ''MacGyver'' DVD season sets.

When MacGyver saves Thornton's life using a [[paper clip]], a [[wrench]] and [[shoelaces]], MacGyver is offered a job as a field agent at the DXS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Partners|series=''MacGyver''|network=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|date=March 1987|season=2|number=18|language=English}}"&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the first episode of Season 2, Thornton takes a job as [[Chief operating officer|Director of Operations]] at the [[Phoenix Foundation (MacGyver)|Phoenix Foundation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=The Human Factor|series=''MacGyver''|network=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|date=September 1986|season=2|number=1|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; and MacGyver follows, where he is hired as a "sort of troubleshooter".&lt;ref&gt;According to Peter Thornton in several episodes throughout the series and MacGyver himself in {{Cite episode|title=Runners|series=''MacGyver''|network=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|date=March 1989|season=4|number=13|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is assigned to a variety of tasks, usually field operations such as conducting environmental surveys and testing security systems.

MacGyver reveals that Harry is his only living relative.&lt;/ref&gt; In the second last episode of the show, it is revealed that MacGyver has a son, Sean "Sam" Angus Malloy. Sean's mother is the photojournalist Kate Malloy who MacGyver had met after college. Kate had been murdered in China several years prior to MacGyver meeting their son for the first time. After discovering and reuniting with Sean, MacGyver decides to resign from the Foundation in order to spend time with his son.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=The Stringer|series=''MacGyver''|network=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|date=April 1992|season=7|number=13|language=English}} Sean is revealed as MacGyver's son.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two [[Television special|television specials]] featuring the character followed, both occurring and released in 1994, two years after the series end. In the first one (''MacGyver: Lost Treasure of Atlantis''), MacGyver teams up with his former college [[Archaeology|archaeology]] instructor, Professor Atticus ([[Brian Blessed]]), to help him prove his theories about ancient [[Atlantis]] while dodging the bullets of genocidal [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] troops, a [[Greece|Greek]] revolutionary and a ruthless treasure hunter. Soon thereafter (''MacGyver: Trail to Doomsday''), he investigates the murder of a friend in Britain, and eventually traces it to an unscrupulous businessman who sells nuclear arms research for profit. No mention in either special is made of Pete Thornton, Jack Dalton, MacGyver's son Sean or any of the show's other regulars.

=== Cultural impact ===
{{Main article|MacGyver in popular culture}}
The term "MacGyver" has now become part of the colloquial American English lexicon. When one "MacGyvers" a solution to a problem, one finds a simple yet elegant solution to something using existing resources.&lt;ref name=britton&gt;Britton, Wesley, ''Spy Television'', Praeger/Greenwood, {{ISBN|0-275-98163-0}}, p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rich&gt;Rich, John, 2006, ''Warm Up the Snake: A Hollywood Memoir'', {{ISBN|0-472-11578-2}}, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is in contrast to a [[kludge]], or a [[Rube Goldberg]], which is generally complicated and problematic.

MacGyver was raised primarily in Mission City, California. His mother passed away when MacGyver was 5, and his father disappeared from MacGyver's life when MacGyver was 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Metal Saw|series=[[MacGyver (2016 TV series)|MacGyver]]|network=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|date=September 2016|season=1|number=2|language=English}} Jack Dalton mentions that MacGyver's mother died when he was 5, and this is confirmed in later episodes; in this episode, MacGyver's father is stated to have left at age 12, though later episodes confirm he was 10, such as {{Cite episode|title=Flashlight|series=[[MacGyver (2016 TV series)|MacGyver]]|network=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|date=March 2016|season=1|number=18|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his fathers disappearance, MacGyver was raised by his grandfather. MacGyver met best friend [[List_of_MacGyver_characters#Recurring_characters_who_are_main_characters_in_the_reboot|Wilt Bozer]] in the fifth grade, and both graduated from Mission City High School. Bozer and MacGyver are roommates when the series begins, although Bozer initially believes that MacGyver works as an IT expert. MacGyver spent two years at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] studying physics, though did not graduate. He left MIT to join the Army because he wanted to make an actual difference in people's lives rather thank thinking about theoretical problems, being trained as an EOD technician and spending three years in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Compass|series=[[MacGyver (2016 TV series)|MacGyver]]|network=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|date=March 2017|season=1|number=19|language=English}} &lt;/ref&gt; In the Army he met Jack Dalton, who was a Delta force soldier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Compass|series=[[MacGyver (2016 TV series)|MacGyver]]|network=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|date=March 2017|season=1|number=19|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;     

After leaving the Army, MacGyver was hired by the Department of External Services, a government clandestine operation using the guise of a think tank. Eventually, Jack Dalton left his position with the CIA and became MacGyver's partner at DXS; by the time of the series pilot, they had spent three years as partners at DXS. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=The Rising|series=[[MacGyver (2016 TV series)|MacGyver]]|network=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|date=September 2016|season=1|number=1|language=English}} &lt;/ref&gt; After DXS's original, unnamed, cover is blown a new cover is needed which will allow for a transition of the organizations assets so its work can continue. MacGyver suggests the name "[[Phoenix (mythology)|Phoenix]]", after the mythological bird that is reborn by rising from its own ashes, and the organization begins using the cover-name of the "Phoenix Foundation".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=The Rising|series=[[MacGyver (2016 TV series)|MacGyver]]|network=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|date=September 2016|season=1|number=1|language=English}} &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trần Lệ Xuân''' (22 August 1924&lt;ref name="nytimes-death"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/27/world/asia/27nhu.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss|title=Madame Nhu, Vietnam War Lightning Rod, Dies|author=Joseph R. Gregory|work=New York Times|date=26 April 2011|accessdate=2011-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; – 24 April 2011), more popularly known in English as '''Madame Nhu''', was the ''de facto'' [[First Lady]] of [[South Vietnam]] from 1955 to 1963. She was the wife of [[Ngô Đình Nhu]], who was the brother and chief-advisor to President [[Ngô Đình Diệm]]. As Diệm was a lifelong bachelor and because she and her family lived in [[Independence Palace]] together with him, she was considered to be the first lady.

Known for her harsh and incendiary comments that denounced anti-government protests by some Buddhist sects and the strong U.S. influence and presence in the country, she had to live in exile in France after her husband and her brother-in-law, Diệm, had been assassinated in 1963.

==Early years==
Trần Lệ Xuân, whose given name means "Spring's Beauty," was born into a wealthy [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] family in [[Hanoi]], [[French Indochina]], then part of the [[French colonial empire]]. Her paternal grandfather was close to the French colonial administration, while her father, [[Tran Van Chuong|Trần Văn Chương]], studied law in France,&lt;ref name="k early"/&gt; and practiced in Bac Lieu in the Mekong Delta before marrying into the ruling imperial dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;J. Lacouture, Vietnam: Between Two Truces, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; Her father also served as the first foreign secretary for Indochina under Japanese occupation.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother, Thân Thị Nam Trân, was a granddaughter of Emperor [[Đồng Khánh]] and a cousin of Emperor [[Bảo Đại]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.4dw.net/royalark/Vietnam/annam9.htm The Royal Ark]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=July 2013}} The Chươngs were under observation by the French police who doubted their loyalty to France with M. Choung dismissed as a "little runt" controlled by his wife while Madame Chuong described as "beautiful and very intriguing...the one who directs her husband" and she was known for "her dogged ambition as for her ''coucheries utilitaires''-sleeping around with people of influence from any and all nationalities".&lt;ref name="Demery, Monique page 33"&gt;Demery, Monique ''Finding the Dragon Lady'', New York: Public Affairs, 2013 page 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lệ Xuân's education at the [[Lycée Albert Sarraut]] was entirely in French, and she remembered as a schoolgirl learning about French history and nothing about Vietnamese history and of singing songs about the forests and mountains of France, observing later the purpose of her education was to eradicate any sense of a Vietnamese identity, and to make her into a proper young Frenchwoman.&lt;ref name="Demery, Monique page 33"/&gt; The purpose of French educational policies in Vietnam was always in reference to France's self-proclaimed ''mission civilisatrice'' ("civilizing mission") was to make all Vietnamese into "Frenchmen with yellow skin", and thus French teachers tried to stamp out any sense of a Vietnamese identity in their students.&lt;ref name="Demery, Monique page 33"/&gt; The message French teachers taught their students was that to be French was to be "civilized" and to be Vietnamese was to be "uncivilized". She dropped out of [[Lycée Albert Sarraut]], a prestigious French school in Hanoi. She spoke French at home and could not write in Vietnamese; as an adult, she drafted her speeches in French and had them translated into Vietnamese.&lt;ref name="k early"&gt;Karnow, pp. 280–284.&lt;/ref&gt; She gained a reputation in her youth as a [[tomboy]] who loved ballet and piano, once dancing solo at Hanoi's National Theatre.&lt;ref name="j early"&gt;Jones, pp. 292–93.&lt;/ref&gt; She had an elder sister named Trần Lệ Chi (who married the Frenchman Etienne Oggeri and changed her name to Lechi Oggeri) and a younger brother, [[Trần Văn Khiêm]].&lt;ref&gt;Warner, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; Like many other Vietnamese, Lệ Xuân was to find that no matter how hard she tried to be French, that the French were only prepared to accept whites as French.&lt;ref&gt;Demery, Monique ''Finding the Dragon Lady'', New York: Public Affairs, 2013 page 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

When she became an adult, her mother introduced her to a series of eligible young men, but she insisted on Nhu. He was fourteen years older and referred to her as "little niece" in accordance with Vietnamese custom.&lt;ref name="p early"&gt;Prochnau, pp. 122–23.&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with Vietnamese tradition, they were married three years after being betrothed in 1940.&lt;ref name="Demery, Monique page 37"&gt;Demery, Monique ''Finding the Dragon Lady'', New York: Public Affairs, 2013 page 37.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1943, aged 18,&lt;ref name=j293&gt;Jones, p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt; she married Nhu, and converted from [[Mahayana Buddhism]] to [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]], her husband's religion. Madame Nhu later admitted she married Nhu as a way of getting away from her family, saying "I never had a sweeping love. I read about such things in books, but I do not believe that they really existed. Or perhaps only for a very few people".&lt;ref name="Demery, Monique page 37"/&gt; After an uprising by the [[Viet Minh]] in August 1945, her brother-in-law, [[Ngô Đình Khôi]], the eldest of the Ngô brothers, was buried alive, {{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} and Nhu and another brother, [[Ngô Đình Cẩn]], were forced to flee. {{Where|date=December 2011}}

She, her mother-in-law and her eldest daughter, at the time a baby, were captured. Thinking her piano was a radio for communicating with French colonialists, the Viet Minh blew it up and then exiled her to a remote village for four months, where she lived on two bowls of rice a day.&lt;ref name="j early"/&gt; The French dismissed Nhu from his post at the National Library due to his brother (Diệm)'s nationalist activities, and he moved to [[Đà Lạt]] and lived comfortably, editing a newspaper, where his wife bore three more children.&lt;ref name="k early"/&gt; The French war in Vietnam made little impression on Madame Nhu from her home in Đà Lạt, and she often called the war "''une guerre bizardouille''" ("a bizarre little war") as the fighting never affected her personally.&lt;ref&gt;Demery, Monique Finding the Dragon Lady, New York: Public Affairs, 2013 page 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Nhu was during these years building a secret political party called the Can Lao (Personalist Labour Party) based on the Catholic philosophy of [[Personalism#Catholic personalism|personalism]] (people were persons, not individuals) while Madame Nhu later saying "I was alone most of the time. My husband would simply disappear without a word".&lt;ref&gt;Demery, Monique Finding the Dragon Lady, New York: Public Affairs, 2013 page 64.&lt;/ref&gt; To improve her husband's career, Madame Nhu befriended her cousin, the Emperor Bao Dai during this time.&lt;ref&gt;Demery, Monique Finding the Dragon Lady, New York: Public Affairs, 2013 pages 65-66.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rise to power==
{{Main|1955 South Vietnamese election}}
Madame Nhu's brother-in-law, Ngo Dinh Diem, had been appointed Prime Minister of the [[State of Vietnam]] by her mother's distant cousin, Emperor [[Bảo Đại]], after the French had been defeated at the [[Battle of Điện Biên Phủ]]. At the start of 1955, [[French Indochina]] was dissolved, leaving Diệm in temporary control of the south.&lt;ref&gt;Maclear, pp. 65–68.&lt;/ref&gt; After the French defeat at the Battle of Điện Biên Phủ, the French wanted to hang on to a zone of influence in the south by keeping the Emperor [[Bảo Đại]] as Head of State, while the Americans wanted to push the French out by having Diem create a republic .&lt;ref&gt;Demery, Monique ''Finding the Dragon Lady'', New York: Public Affairs, 2013 pages 80-81.&lt;/ref&gt; Diem in the words of an American diplomat had developed "a blind hatred of the French" and the Americans believed that South Vietnam needed an anti-Communist leader who was not tainted with any associations with the French, which led them to back Diem.&lt;ref name="Demery, Monique page 81"&gt;Demery, Monique ''Finding the Dragon Lady'', New York: Public Affairs, 2013 page 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Madame Nhu had lobbied Bao Dai to appoint her brother-in-law Prime Minister and believed that it was her influence that led to the appointment.&lt;ref name="Demery, Monique page 81"/&gt; She was deeply shocked to learn the real reason why Bao Dai had appointed Diem Prime Minister was out of the expectation that he would fail in order to neutralize him as the State of Vietnam was in a serious political and economic crisis by 1954 that almost nobody expected Diem to master, and she never forgave either the Emperor or the French for their plot to ruin Diem.&lt;ref name="Demery, Monique page 81"/&gt; 

In order to ensure American support for Diem, Madame Nhu befriended Americans working at the embassy in Saigon known to be CIA agents.&lt;ref&gt;Demery, Monique ''Finding the Dragon Lady'', New York: Public Affairs, 2013 pages 81-82.&lt;/ref&gt; For their part, the French backed General [[Nguyễn Văn Hinh]] as Prime Minister, and he in his turn had won the support of the [[Binh Xuyen]] crime syndicate that dominated the economic life of Saigon.&lt;ref&gt;Demery, Monique ''Finding the Dragon Lady'', New York: Public Affairs, 2013 pages 82-83.&lt;/ref&gt; Giving Madame Nhu an additional reason to intrigue against Hinh was his repeated boasting that when he deposed Diem he would make Madame Nhu into another of his concubines.&lt;ref&gt;Demery, Monique ''Finding the Dragon Lady'', New York: Public Affairs, 2013 page 83&lt;/ref&gt; At a party, Madame Nhu confronted Hinh to tell him: "You are never going to overthrow this government because you don't have the guts. And if you do overthrow the government, you will never have me because I will claw your throat out first!"&lt;ref&gt;Demery, Monique ''Finding the Dragon Lady'', New York: Public Affairs, 2013 page 83.&lt;/ref&gt; 

To win support for Diem, Madame Nhu hit upon the idea of enlisting support from the million or so refugees from North Vietnam, many of them Catholics who fled to the south after the Geneva accords had partitioned Vietnam, organizing them for a massive pro-Diem demonstration on 21 September 1954.&lt;ref&gt;Demery, Monique ''Finding the Dragon Lady'', New York: Public Affairs, 2013 page 86.&lt;/ref&gt; The rally in Saigon led a confrontation on the streets between Madame Nhu and Binh Xuyen gunmen, with Nhu daring the thugs to kill her right then and there, which caused them to demur, and the rally went on.&lt;ref&gt;Demery, Monique ''Finding the Dragon Lady'', New York: Public Affairs, 2013 page 87.&lt;/ref&gt; Emboldened by this triumph, Diem saw a chance to put his puritanical Roman Catholic values into practice and to strike a blow at the Binh Xuyen at the same time by shutting down the brothels, gambling houses and opium dens of Saigon owned by the Binh Xuyen while having pornographic magazines burned on the streets (the Binh Xuyen were the largest producers and sellers of pornography in Vietnam).&lt;ref&gt;Demery, Monique ''Finding the Dragon Lady'', New York: Public Affairs, 2013 page 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

A referendum was scheduled for 23 October 1955, to determine the future direction of the south. It was contested by [[Bảo Đại]], the Emperor, advocating the restoration of the monarchy, while Diệm ran on a republican platform. The elections were held, with Nhu and the family's [[Can Lao Party|Cần Lao Party]], which supplied Diệm's electoral base, organising and supervising the elections.&lt;ref&gt;Langguth, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; Campaigning for Emperor [[Bảo Đại]] was prohibited, and the result was rigged, with Bảo Đại's supporters attacked by Nhu's paid thugs. Diệm claimed 98.2% of the vote, including 605,025 votes in Saigon, where only 450,000 voters were registered. Diệm's tally exceeded the registration numbers in other districts.&lt;ref name="Karnow, p. 239"&gt;Karnow, p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jacobs"&gt;Jacobs, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Diệm eliminated the Emperor Bao Dai and became the first president of South Vietnam.&lt;ref name="Karnow, p. 239"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jacobs"&gt;Jacobs, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; Madame Nhu made no secret of her dislike for the Emperor Bao Dai, calling him "that French puppet".&lt;ref&gt;Demery, Monique ''Finding the Dragon Lady'', New York: Public Affairs, 2013 page 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-elections==
[[File:Madame Ngô Đình Nhu and Lyndon Baines Johnson.jpg|right|thumb|222px|Madame Nhu and Vice President Johnson, visit to Vietnam, [[1961 in the Vietnam War#May|May 1961]]]]
After the election, the couple moved into the [[Presidential Palace]]. Madame Nhu was influential on government policy and, since her brother-in-law, [[Ngô Đình Diệm]], was unmarried, she was regarded as the [[First Lady]] of [[South Vietnam]].&lt;ref name="k early"/&gt; She attempted to combine [[Roman Catholic]]ism with herself as a modern reincarnation of Vietnam's fabled [[Trưng Sisters]], who temporarily defeated the invading [[Han Dynasty|Hán Dynasty]] Chinese troops in [[Anno Domini|AD]] 40.&lt;ref name="k early"/&gt; President Diem never married and is not known to have had a relationship with any women, through his bodyguard noted he was fond of keeping "good looking men around him".&lt;ref name="Demery, Monique page 98"&gt;Demery, Monique ''Finding the Dragon Lady'', New York: Public Affairs, 2013 page 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Diem, who was known for his poor social skills, decided to have his sister-in-law serve as the unofficial First Lady of South Vietnam.&lt;ref name="Demery, Monique page 98"/&gt; Madame Nhu frequently talked to the Vietnamese, French and foreign press quite candidly. Madame Nhu's marriage was unhappy as she wrote in her diary of an all consuming "rising desire" in her body, complained her husband had little interest in sex with her, and wrote with disgust of his affections for a younger woman whom she called that "creature" who was very "vulgar" and "dirty".&lt;ref&gt;Demery, Monique ''Finding the Dragon Lady'', New York: Public Affairs, 2013 page 107.&lt;/ref&gt; Madame Nhu devoted her time to politics, championing a new Family Code she presented to parliament in October 1957 and passed in June 1958 to replace the old French code that banned concubinage and polygamy; allowed women to open bank accounts and own property; and required that daughters be given greater inheritance rights.&lt;ref&gt;Demery, Monique ''Finding the Dragon Lady'', New York: Public Affairs, 2013 page 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, she had a statue erected in [[Saigon]] to the memory of the [[Trưng Sisters]], with the facial features modelled on herself, and also established the Women's Solidarity Movement, a female paramilitary organization.&lt;ref&gt;Langguth, pp. 169–171.&lt;/ref&gt; The statue cost US$20,000, a substantial sum at the time, given that South Vietnam was a developing country, but she was undeterred by criticism about largesse.&lt;ref name=l170/&gt; She pressured the wives of [[ARVN]] officers and public servants into joining her "movement".&lt;ref name=l170&gt;Langguth, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; A flamboyant woman, Madame Nhu took to flashing around her handgun in public, and the Women's Solidarity Movement was intended to allow Vietnamese women to participate in the fight against the Viet Cong, just as the Trung sisters had fought against the Chinese, but most of the women who joined the movement were upper-class women who believed that their husbands would benefit by being given government jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Demery, Monique ''Finding the Dragon Lady'', New York: Public Affairs, 2013 pages 125-126.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her father became the ambassador to the United States while her mother was South Vietnam's observer at the United Nations. Two of her uncles were cabinet ministers.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt; Her parents resigned from their posts in 1963, in protest over the treatment of Buddhists under the regime of President Diệm and disowned their daughter.&lt;ref&gt;The couple was found strangled to death in Washington, D.C., in 1986, killed by their son, Trần Văn Khiêm, reportedly for being cut out of their will, according to "Change in Will Linked to Saigon Aide's Death", ''The New York Times'', 8 August 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

Howard Jones says "Madame Nhu was chauffeured in a black [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]] and wore a small diamond crucifix",&lt;ref name=j293/&gt; and "wore form-fitting apparel so tight that one French correspondent suggestively described her as 'molded into her ... dress like a dagger in its sheath.' On formal occasions, she wore red [[satin]] pantaloons with three vertical [[pleat]]s, which was the mark of the highest-ranking women of the imperial court in ancient [[Vietnam|Annam]]." When Diệm once criticized her apparel, she snapped: ''"It's not your neck that sticks out, it's mine. So, shut up."''&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advocacy==
During her brother-in-law's presidency, Madame Nhu pushed for the passing of "morality laws" outlawing abortion, [[adultery]], divorce, [[contraceptive]]s, dance halls, beauty pageants, [[boxing]] matches, and [[animal fighting]], and closed down the [[brothel]]s and [[opium]] dens. She was widely mocked by the public who regarded her as a hypocrite,&lt;ref name="k early"/&gt; with older Vietnamese believing her ''[[décolleté]]'' gowns to be sexually suggestive. In Vietnam's Confucian culture, overt displays of sexuality are considered inappropriate. Her family received further scorn as her sister Trần Lệ Chi, who was married to Nguyển Hữu Châu, had a French lover named Etienne Oggeri, and critics alleged that Madame Nhu introduced the "morality laws" so that her sister's husband could not get a divorce. Since he was extremely wealthy, the Ngô family would have lost highly valuable assets. In addition, her brother, Khiêm, used his government connections to [[wiktionary:bilk|bilk]] rich entrepreneurs.&lt;ref name="k early"/&gt; Diệm had stated before becoming President, "The history of China bears witness to the grave crises brought on by the empresses and their relatives." The Diệm regime tended to favor giving high positions to Roman Catholics, which alienated the Buddhist majority over the time. 

Madame Nhu exerted influence with her fiery attitude, often abusing Diệm and Nhu, who bowed to her angry tirades. Madame Nhu was frequently mocked by the media for her ostentatious flaunting of power, and was sometimes called the "[[Dragon Lady]]",&lt;ref&gt;Langguth, pp. 109–111&lt;/ref&gt; as well as "[[Lucrezia Borgia|Lucretia Borgia]]" and "Queen Bee".&lt;ref name=j292&gt;Jones, p. 292.&lt;/ref&gt; She once stated "Power is wonderful. Total power is totally wonderful."&lt;ref&gt;Warner, pp. 117–19.&lt;/ref&gt; In Vietnam, Madame Nhu was called the Tiger Lady as dragons are considered lucky and benevolent (mythical) animals in Vietnamese culture that are the wise and kindly friends of humanity whereas the tiger is considered a symbol of ferocity, and many Vietnamese found the term "Dragon Lady" mystifying and insulting.&lt;ref&gt;Demery, Monique ''Finding the Dragon Lady'', New York: Public Affairs, 2013 page 117.&lt;/ref&gt;  She once told a group of American congressmen, "I'm not exactly afraid of death. I love power and in the next life I have a chance to be even more powerful than I am."&lt;ref name=mw65&gt;Maitland and Weiss, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;  U.S. Defense Secretary [[Robert McNamara|McNamara]] noted that "I saw Madame Nhu as bright, forceful, and beautiful, but also diabolical and scheming—a true sorceress."&lt;ref&gt;McNamara, In Retrospect, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

She had a message to Diệm's opponents: "We will track down, neutralize and extirpate all these scabby sheep."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,829109-2,00.html "Joan or Lucrezia?"], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', 23 March 1962&lt;/ref&gt; French journalist [[François Sully]] wrote that Madame Nhu was "conceited, and obsessed with a drive for power that far surpasses that of even her husband ... It is no exaggeration to say that Madame Nhu is the most detested personality in South Vietnam."&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pp. 195–196.&lt;/ref&gt; Sully was promptly expelled from Vietnam by the Ngô family.&lt;ref name=j196&gt;Jones, p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;

Madame Nhu claimed that she and her husband were responsible for Diệm's triumph over the [[Bình Xuyên]] in the [[Battle for Saigon]] in 1954.&lt;ref name=j196&gt;Jones, p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; She claimed it was the family's destiny to save South Vietnam.&lt;ref name=l109&gt;Langguth, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the collapse of the coup, her influence in the family began to rise.&lt;ref name=l111&gt;Langguth, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

As her husband's influence grew, as did her own vicariously, so did American distaste for them. [[Wesley Fishel]], the anti-Communist academic from [[Michigan State University]] who had led an advisory group that helped to train Vietnamese public servants and who had lobbied American politicians in the 1950s to support Diệm's bid for power, resigned along with his staff.&lt;ref name=l164/&gt; Fishel called Madame Nhu "Brilliant, vivacious, bitchy and brutal in her Borgia-like fashion", claiming that she and her husband were evil influences corrupting the regime.&lt;ref name=l164&gt;Langguth, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;

She often exerted her influence through bouts of shouting. Sometimes when she disagreed with a proposal or decision that had been made inside the palace by some ministers or other senior public servants, she would verbally abuse them and intimidate them into adopting her preferred stance.&lt;ref name=l212&gt;Langguth, p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 February 1962, two dissident [[Republic of Vietnam Air Force]] pilots, [[Nguyễn Văn Cử (pilot)|Nguyễn Văn Cử]] and [[Phạm Phú Quốc]], [[1962 South Vietnamese Independence Palace bombing|bombed]] the [[Independence Palace]], the official residence of the Ngô family, with the aim of assassinating them. One bomb landed in a room where Diệm was reading, but failed to detonate. The family escaped to the cellar unhurt, except for Madame Nhu, who sustained an arm fracture while running for cover.&lt;ref name="k"&gt;{{cite book|title=Vietnam: A history|authorlink=Stanley Karnow|first=Stanley|last=Karnow|year=1997|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|pages=280–81|isbn=0-670-84218-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diệm reacted to the bombing by cracking down on political dissidents and further tightening control of the press.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, p. 405.&lt;/ref&gt; Madame Nhu added, "[y]ou open a window to let in light and air, not bullets. We want freedom, but we don't want to be exploited by it."&lt;ref&gt;Warner, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; In a radio interview in late-1962, she mockingly remarked that American journalists were "intoxicated with communism."&lt;ref name=s208&gt;Sheehan, p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year she instructed her Women's Solidarity Movement to oppose American attempts "to make lackeys of Vietnamese and to seduce Vietnamese women into decadent paths."&lt;ref name=j245&gt;Jones, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt; As relations became strained, she publicly accused the Americans of having supported the 1960 coup.&lt;ref name=l219&gt;Langguth, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhist crisis==
On 8 May 1963, a series of celebrations were held by Buddhist priests all over South Vietnam to honor Buddhist holiday of [[Vesak]], as 8 May was the 2,527th anniversary of Lord Buddha's birthday.&lt;ref&gt;Demery, Monique ''Finding the Dragon Lady'', New York: Public Affairs, 2013 page 158.&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic Diem disapproved of Vesak, and ordered the police to put the Vesak celebrations under a law which forbade religious symbols from being paraded in the streets. A series of clashes occurred all over South Vietnam as the police sought to end the marches. When she heard that Diệm was to sign a statement offering compensation to the families of Buddhist protesters shot dead by the police of his brother [[Ngô Đình Cẩn]], she was reported to have thrown a bowl of soup at him.&lt;ref name="lbuddhist"&gt;Langguth, p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 June 1963, Madame Nhu released a statement through the Women's Solidarity Movement accusing the Buddhists of neutralism, effectively accusing them of being [[communist front|communist collaborators]]. It then implored "[[Bhikkhu|bonzes]] of good faith" to stop helping the communists, otherwise Vietnamese Buddhism would be seen as a "small anti-nationalist branch of a dubious international association, exploited and controlled by communism and oriented to the sowing of the disorder of neutralism" and calling on Diem to "immediately expel all foreign [[agitator]]s whether they wear monks' robes or not." She made another attack on the United States, calling on Diệm to "keep vigilance on all others, particularly those inclined to take Viet Nam for [a] satellite of [a] foreign power or organization."&lt;ref name=l212/&gt;&lt;ref name=j266&gt;Jones, p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt; Madame Nhu publicly mocked [[Thích Quảng Đức]], who performed a [[self-immolation]] on 11 June 1963 in a crowded [[Saigon]] street to protest against the shooting of Buddhists by Diệm's regime. She labelled it a "[[barbecue]]" and stated, "Let them burn and we shall clap our hands."&lt;ref name="lbuddhist"/&gt; She further offered to provide more fuel and matches for the Buddhists, noting the "barbecuing" was not "self-sufficient" because "imported gasoline" was used.&lt;ref&gt;''Vietnam: A Television History'': America's Mandarin (1954-1963)&lt;/ref&gt; The monk's suicide followed Ngo Dinh Nhu's repression of the Buddhist-inspired protests and was responsible for the regime's continuing instability.  According to historian Howard Jones, these comments "all but put the finishing touch on the Diệm regime".

Her own father went on radio to condemn her comments.&lt;ref name=j292/&gt; A [[Confucianism|Confucian]], [[Trần Văn Chương|Chương]] said that the regime had alienated "the strongest moral forces", implying that they had lost the [[Mandate of Heaven]]. She responded by calling him a "coward". Her mother said that "There is an old proverb in my country which means 'one should not make oneself or one's family naked before the world'...  I was sick... Now, nobody can stop her ... She never listened to our advice."&lt;ref name=j293/&gt; After these comments, the U.S. ambassador, [[Frederick Nolting]], told Diệm that if he did not denounce his sister-in-law's comment in public, the U.S. would have to stop supporting him, but the president refused to do so, and assailed the monks.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, pp. 294–5.&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with [[David Halberstam]], Madame Nhu said that it was ''"embarrassing to see people [Buddhist leaders] so uncultured claiming to be leaders"''. The U.S. embassy told Diệm that these comments violated an agreement between the Buddhists and his regime to avoid verbal exchanges, but Diệm refused to keep his family's end of the bargain, saying that his sister-in-law was obliged to expose "extremists" to keep the public informed.&lt;ref name=j266/&gt; In July, the US government rejected a request from her to travel to the United States for a public speaking tour, fearing a public relations disaster.&lt;ref name="j290"&gt;Jones, p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 August, she called the Buddhists "[[sedition|seditious]] elements who use the most odious Communist tactics to [[subversion|subvert]] the country."&lt;ref name=j291&gt;Jones, p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt;

This occurred after [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam Special Forces|special forces]] loyal to the Ngôs [[Xá Lợi Pagoda raids|raided the Xá Lợi Pagoda]] in Saigon in August. The pagoda was vandalized, monks beaten, and the cremated remains of [[Thích Quảng Đức]], which included a heart which had not disintegrated, were confiscated. Simultaneous raids were carried out across the country, with the [[Từ Đàm Pagoda]] in [[Huế]] being looted, the statue of [[Gautama Buddha]] demolished, and the body of a deceased monk stolen. When the populace came to the defense of the monks, the resulting clashes saw 30 civilians killed and 200 wounded.&lt;ref name="crackdown"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,940704-1,00.html|work=Time|title=South Viet Nam: The Crackdown|date=30 August 1963|accessdate=12 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, President Diem sent his sister-in-law a letter asking her not to talk in public about the clashes as her "barbecue" remarks had been a public relations disaster for his regime, both at home and abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Demery, Monique Finding the Dragon Lady, New York: Public Affairs, 2013 page 166.&lt;/ref&gt; Through her paramilitary organization, Madame Nhu claimed that the Buddhists were "controlled by communism" and that they were manipulated by the Americans, calling on Diệm to "expel all foreign agitators whether they wear monks' robes or not".&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; A few days after the raids, Madame Nhu described the deadly attacks on the Buddhists as "the happiest day in my life since we crushed the [[Bình Xuyên]] in 1955", and assailed them as "communists."&lt;ref name=hal146&gt;Halberstam, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States, in a position of some leverage owing to the considerable US aid flowing into South Vietnam, in August 1963 wished to give President Diệm a chance to rid himself of both his brother and Madame Nhu. In a cable drafted by Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs, [[Roger Hilsman]], to [[United States Ambassador to South Vietnam|Ambassador]] [[Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.|Henry Cabot Lodge]], Lodge was instructed to advise Diệm of a call for "the removal of the Nhus from the scene."&lt;ref&gt;R. McNamara, ''In Retrospect'', p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. [[John F. Kennedy|President Kennedy]] supported the message in [[Cable 243|the cable]] upon its approval by most of his advisors.&lt;ref&gt;Id., pp. 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her comments further stoked open infighting with her parents, who would eventually disown her and seek refuge in the United States. Her father, [[Trần Văn Chương]], the ambassador to the United States, resigned in protest,&lt;ref name=j154/&gt;&lt;ref name=k302&gt;Karnow, p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt; along with all but one of the staffers at the embassy.&lt;ref name=hal151&gt;Halberstam, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; Chương charged Diệm with having "copied the tactics of totalitarian regimes".&lt;ref name=j154&gt;Jacobs, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; His wife, who was South Vietnam's observer at the United Nations, resigned and spoke of mass executions and a reign of terror under Diệm and Nhu. She predicted that if Diệm and Nhu and Madame Nhu did not leave Vietnam then they would inevitably be killed.&lt;ref name="h171"&gt;Hammer, p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; Madame Nhu claimed Buddhist leader [[Thích Trí Quang]] "spoke for many intellectuals who had repeatedly ridiculed her."&lt;ref name="j306"&gt;Jones, p. 306.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the pagoda raids, Trí Quang was given asylum at the U.S. Embassy after [[Ngô Đình Nhu]]'s plans to assassinate him were uncovered. Madame Nhu gave a media interview in which she called on government troops to invade the American embassy and capture Thích Trí Quang and some other monks who were staying there, saying that the government must arrest "all key Buddhists".&lt;ref name=j306/&gt; In a media interview, her husband responded to his parents-in-law by vowing to kill his father-in-law, claiming his wife would participate. He said "I will have his head cut off. I will hang him in the center of a square and let him dangle there. My wife will make the knot on the rope because she is proud of being a Vietnamese and she is a good patriot."&lt;ref name=j393&gt;Jones, p. 393.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visiting the United States==

When acting U.S. ambassador [[William Trueheart]] warned that development aid might be withheld if the repression orchestrated by the Ngôs continued, Madame Nhu denounced it as "[[blackmail]]". Nhu and Diệm, fearing a cut in aid, sent Madame Nhu to the United States on a speaking tour. She departed South Vietnam on 9 September 1963 in an expedition that brought widespread international scorn to her family's regime.&lt;ref name=j351&gt;Jones, p. 351.&lt;/ref&gt; She had predicted "a triumphant lecture tour".&lt;ref name=j352/&gt; She left on 17 September for the [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]] meeting in [[Yugoslavia]], followed by a trip to [[Italy]] and possibly to the United States, where she had an invitation to speak before the [[Overseas Press Club]] of New York.

Madame Nhu's comments were such that President [[John F. Kennedy]] became personally concerned. He asked his advisers to find means of having Diệm gag her. [[McGeorge Bundy]] thought her comments were so damaging that it would only be acceptable for Ngô Đình Diệm to remain in power if she were out of the picture. The [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] deemed her a threat to U.S. security, and told the then [[United States Ambassador to South Vietnam]], [[Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.]] to seek her permanent removal from South Vietnam.&lt;ref name=j352&gt;Jones, p. 352.&lt;/ref&gt;

There was also speculation that she could turn up at the United Nations in New York and embarrass South Vietnam and the U.S.&lt;ref name=j357&gt;Jones, p. 357.&lt;/ref&gt; Bundy said in a meeting that "this was the first time the world had been faced with collective madness in a ruling family since the days of the [[Romanovs|czars]]" and her comments provoked much debate on how to get Diệm to silence her.&lt;ref name=j359&gt;Jones, p. 359.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Madame Nhu's first destination, [[Belgrade]], she said in an interview that "President Kennedy is a politician, and when he hears a loud opinion speaking in a certain way, he tries to appease it somehow", referring to the opposition to her family's rule.&lt;ref name=j359/&gt; She continued: "if that opinion is misinformed, the solution is not to bow to it, but the solution should be to inform."&lt;ref&gt;US Dept of State: Historical Documents

{{See also|McNamara-Taylor mission}}
The issue resulted in an awkward confrontation when U.S. Defense Secretary [[Robert McNamara]] and the Chairman of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], General [[Maxwell Taylor]], traveled to Vietnam for a fact-finding mission about the progress of the war.  One of the purposes of the mission was to achieve, in the words of President Kennedy, "a visible reduction in influence of Nhus, who are symbol to disaffected of all that they dislike in GVN.  This we think would require Nhus' departure from Saigon and preferably Vietnam at least for extended vacation."&lt;ref&gt;R. McNamara, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 29 September 1963 meeting with Diệm, McNamara bemoaned "the ill-advised and unfortunate declarations of Madame Nhu",&lt;ref name=j372&gt;Jones, p. 372.&lt;/ref&gt; who had described U.S. military advisors as "acting like little soldiers of fortune".&lt;ref name=j372/&gt; McNamara said that such comments would damage bilateral military cooperation and deter American officers from helping the South Vietnamese forces.&lt;ref name=j372/&gt; Lodge denounced the comments and said, "These men should be thanked, not insulted."&lt;ref name=l246&gt;Langguth, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt; However, one of his aides lost his composure and asked if "there were not something the government could do to shut her up."&lt;ref name=j372/&gt; Diệm was stunned by the comments and retorted that "one cannot deny a lady the right to defend herself when she has been unjustly attacked", saying his sister-in-law was entitled to freedom of speech.&lt;ref name=j372/&gt; But McNamara reinforced the point, noting to Diem that "This is not satisfactory.  The problems were real and serious.  They had to be solved before the war could be won."&lt;ref&gt;R. McNamara, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

Madame Nhu arrived in the United States on 7 October, and her arrival was greeted by the United Nations' launching of an inquiry into the repression of Buddhists in South Vietnam.&lt;ref name=j385&gt;Jones, p. 385.&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy had resisted the temptation to deny her an entry visa and his administration soon came under a flurry of verbal attacks.&lt;ref name=j385/&gt;

Despite U.S. Vice President [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s advice for her to stop damaging relations with inflammatory remarks, Madame Nhu refused to back down, describing herself as a "[[scapegoat]]" for American shortcomings and failures. She went on to accuse the administration of betraying her family, saying "I refuse to play the role of an accomplice in an awful murder ... According to a few immature American junior officials—too imbued by a real but obsolete imperialist spirit, the Vietnamese regime is not puppet enough and must be liquidated."&lt;ref name=j385/&gt; She accused the Americans of undermining South Vietnam through "briberies, threats and other means" to destroy her family because they "do not like" it.&lt;ref name=j385/&gt; She further mocked Kennedy's entourage, asking why "all the people around President Kennedy are [[pinko|pink]]?"

She denounced American liberals as "worse than communists"&lt;ref name=Cooper&gt;{{cite book|last=Cooper|first=Chester L.|title=The Lost Crusade: America in Vietnam|year=1970|publisher=Dodd, Mead &amp; Co.|location=New York|pages=196–197}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Buddhists as "[[hooligan]]s in robes".&lt;ref&gt;p. 73 Newcomb, Richard F. ''
A Pictorial History of the Vietnam War'' Doubleday, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; Her father did not share the same beliefs and followed her around the country rebutting her comments,&lt;ref name=j385/&gt; denouncing the "injustice and oppression" and stating that his daughter had "become unwittingly the greatest asset to the communists." She  predicted that Buddhism would become extinct in Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;Karnow, pp. 296–320&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Oram Group]], the Madison Avenue PR firm that had been hired to promote Diem's image in the U.S. for $3,000 per month ended its relationship with Diem during Madame Nhu's visit under the grounds she had so badly damaged the image of the Diem government in America that there was nothing that could be done to improve his image and a continued association was going to cost the Oram Group other clients.&lt;ref&gt;Demery, Monique Finding the Dragon Lady, New York: Public Affairs, 2013 pages 180-181.&lt;/ref&gt; American journalists had discovered Madame Nhu was "unfortunately too beautiful to ignore" as a Kennedy administration staffer complained, and that it was easy to provoke her into saying something outrageous, causing a media circus to develop around her as she traveled across America.&lt;ref&gt;Demery, Monique Finding the Dragon Lady, New York: Public Affairs, 2013 page 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of the tumultuous events, Madame Nhu appeared on [[NBC-TV]]'s ''[[Meet the Press]]'' on 13 October 1963, defending her actions and those of the South Vietnamese government. "I don't know why you Americans dislike us ... Is it because the world is under a spell called liberalism? Your own public, here in America, is not as anti-Communistic as ours is in Vietnam. Americans talk about my husband and I leaving our native land permanently. Why should we do this? Where would we go? To say that 70 percent of my country's population is Buddhistic is absolutely true. My father, who was our ambassador to the United States until two months ago, has been against me since my childhood."

==Downfall==
{{See also|Arrest and assassination of Ngô Đình Diệm}}
On 2 November 1963, Diệm and Nhu were assassinated in a ''coup d'état'' led by General [[Dương Văn Minh]] (Armed Forces Council) with the understanding that the United States would not intervene. At the time of the assassinations, Madame Nhu was in [[Beverly Hills, California]], traveling with her 18-year-old daughter, [[Ngô Đình Lệ Thủy]].&lt;ref name="jg2"/&gt; Her other children were in Vietnam at the family retreat in [[Đà Lạt]] and she feared that they would meet the same fate as their father.&lt;ref name=j431&gt;Jones, p. 431.&lt;/ref&gt; The children were not harmed by the generals and were flown out of the country into exile in Rome, where they were placed in the custody of their uncle, [[Pierre Martin Ngô Đình Thục|Archbishop Thục]]. Madame Nhu later flew to Rome to join them.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pp. 432–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the killings of Diệm and Nhu, she immediately accused the United States, saying "Whoever has the Americans as allies does not need enemies",&lt;ref name=j407&gt;Jones, p. 407.&lt;/ref&gt; and that "No coup can erupt without American incitement and backing".&lt;ref name=jg2/&gt; She went on to predict a bleak future for Vietnam and said that, by being involved in the coup, the troubles of the United States in Vietnam were just beginning.&lt;ref name="jg2"/&gt; She called the deaths an "indelible stigma" against the U.S. and said "My family has been treacherously killed with either official or unofficial blessing of the American government, I can predict to you now that the story is only at its beginning."&lt;ref name="jg2"&gt;Jones, p. 433.&lt;/ref&gt; She invoked biblical analogies, saying "[[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] has sold the Christ for [[thirty pieces of silver]]. The Ngô brothers have been sold for a few dollars."&lt;ref name="jg2"/&gt; When asked if she wanted [[Right of asylum|asylum]] in the United States, she said, "I cannot stay in a country whose government stabbed me in the back. I believe all the devils in hell are against us."&lt;ref name="jq"&gt;Jones, p. 423.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the coup, the statues of the [[Trưng Sisters]] that Madame Nhu had erected with her own facial features were demolished by jubilant anti-Diệm rioters.&lt;ref name=j424&gt;Jones, p. 424.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Times of Vietnam]]'' office was also burned down, and the newspaper was never published again.&lt;ref name=j424/&gt;

==Life in exile==
The military government of Vietnam under General [[Dương Văn Minh]] confiscated all of the property in [[Saigon]] that belonged to Madame Nhu and her family, and she was not allowed  to return to South Vietnam. She went to Rome briefly before moving permanently to France with her children. Her daughter, Lệ Thủy, died in 1967, at age 22, in a car accident in [[Longjumeau]], France.&lt;ref name="milestones"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,843633-1,00.html Milestones: 21 April 1967], ''Time''&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1982 Madame Nhu accorded a first significant interview on the historic events in Vietnam to [[Judith Vecchione]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://openvault.wgbh.org/blog/2011/05/interviewing-madame-nhu-1982/ Interviewing Madame Nhu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106032919/http://openvault.wgbh.org/blog/2011/05/interviewing-madame-nhu-1982/ |date=6 January 2014 }}, 1982 by Judith Vecchione&lt;/ref&gt; in Rome. Vecchione was a producer for ''[[Vietnam: A Television History]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/vietnam/ |title=American Experience &amp;#124; Vietnam, a Television History |publisher=PBS |accessdate=Dec 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series subsequently aired on [[PBS]] in 1983.

On 2 November 1986, Madame Nhu charged the United States with hounding her family during the arrest of her younger brother, [[Trần Văn Khiêm]], who was charged in the strangling deaths of their parents in their Washington, D.C. home after being cut out of their will.&lt;ref name="nytimes-death"/&gt;

In 1993, she sued her parents' insurance company to prevent it from awarding their death benefit because she contested the validity of their wills. Her parents allegedly changed their wills, disinheriting their son Khiem and Madame Nhu and making their sister Le Chi the sole beneficiary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dc.findacase.com/research/wfrmDocViewer.aspx/xq/fac.19930302_0001.DC.htm/qx FindACase | 03/02/93 ESTATE TRAN VAN CHUONG v. FIRST AMERICAN&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, she was reportedly living on the [[French Riviera]] and charging the press for interviews. In 2002, she gave an interview to journalist Truong Phu Thu of ''[[Dân Chúa Mỹ Châu]]'', a Vietnamese Catholic community publication. It was published in October 2004. The article stated that she was living in Paris and working on her memoirs.&lt;ref name="bbc-tpt"&gt;{{vi}} {{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/vietnamese/vietnam/2011/04/110426_tranlexuan_book.shtml|title='Bà Nhu như tôi từng biết' (phần 1)'|publisher=BBC News|date=26 April 2011|accessdate=2011-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her last years, she lived with her eldest son, Ngô Đình Trác, and youngest daughter, Ngô Đình Lệ Quyên, in Rome, and was reportedly working on a book of memoirs to be published posthumously.&lt;ref name="bbc-tpt"/&gt;

In early April 2011, she was taken to a hospital in Rome where she died three weeks later, on [[Easter Sunday]], 24 April 2011.&lt;ref name="death-bbc"&gt;{{vi}} {{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/vietnamese/vietnam/2011/04/110425_tranlexuan_dies.shtml|title=Bà Trần Lệ Xuân qua đời|publisher=BBC News|date=24 April 2011|accessdate=2011-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes-death"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/26/madame-nhu-obituary|title=Madame Nhu obituary|author=Robert Templer|date=26 April 2011|accessdate=2011-04-26|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="death-rfi"&gt;{{vi}} {{cite news|url=http://www.viet.rfi.fr/viet-nam/20110425-ba-ngo-dinh-nhu-tu-tran-tai-roma-tho-87-tuoi|publisher=[[Radio France Internationale]]|date=25 April 2011|accessdate=2011-04-25|title=Bà Ngô Đình Nhu từ trần tại Roma, hưởng thọ 87 tuổi|author=Tú Anh}}&lt;/ref&gt; News of her death was announced by her sister Lechi Oggeri, while family friend Truong Phu Thu was interviewed by [[BBC News]] afterwards.&lt;ref name="bbc-tpt"/&gt;

==Influence on Vietnamese fashion==
In the early 1960s, Madame Nhu popularized a tight-fitting version of the traditional ''[[áo dài]]'' (long dress) that was considered controversial in its day, due to its tight fit and low-cut neckline. According to Boi Tran Huynh, a scholar of Vietnamese visual arts, "To foreigners, this collar made sense, given the tropical conditions, but conservatives saw it as too suggestive for Vietnamese women."&lt;ref name="Nhufashion"&gt;[http://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/bitstream/2123/633/3/adt-NU20051129.15002905Chapter4.pdf ''Vietnamese Aesthetics from 1925 Onwards'' by Boi Tran Huynh; Chapter 4: Visual Arts of the Republic of Viet-Nam (The South) 1954–1975: The 'Other']&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mantineia Base''' is an ensemble of three [[Ancient Greek art|ancient Greek]] [[bas relief]] plaques, one of which depicts [[Apollo]], [[Marsyas]] and a [[silenus]], and the other two of which each show a group of three [[Muses]]. They were discovered in 1887 on the site of the ancient Gree city of [[Mantineia]] in [[Arcadia]] and were probably decoration for a statue base. They have been attributed to the sculptor [[Praxiteles]] or another member of his workshop. They are currently kept in the [[National Archaeological Museum of Athens]], where their inventory numbers are NAMA 215-217.

== Description ==
On 11 August 1887 in the course of excavations at Mantineia by the [[French School at Athens]], the archaeologist Gustave Fougères discovered the three plaques, which had been reused in the floor of a [[Byzantine]] church.&lt;ref name="F105"&gt;Fougères, p.&amp;nbsp;105.&lt;/ref&gt; The upper part had been heavily worn by the passage of the parishioners, but the side facing downwards still bore sculpted decoration in a good state. The plaques were immediately transferred to the [[National Archaeological Museum of Athens]], where they were restored.&lt;ref name="F105" /&gt;

They are made of white marble, which was once identified as the marble of Doliana, near [[Tegea]],&lt;ref name="F105" /&gt; but is now recognised to be [[Pentelic marble]].&lt;ref name="P110"&gt;Pasquier, p.&amp;nbsp;110.&lt;/ref&gt; The three plaques have very similar dimensions: NAMA 216 is 1.35 m wide and 0.96 m high; NAMA 215 and 217 are 1.36 m by 0.96 m and 0.98 m respectively.&lt;ref name="F105" /&gt; Their depth varies from 8 to 12 cm.&lt;ref name="F105" /&gt; They are decorated in the same way: on the upper part, an [[Echinus (molding)|Echinus]] moulding above a broad flat band, on the lower edge there is a concave moulding and another broad flat band. Each panel has three attachment holes in the same locations. These aspects indicate that they were all made together.&lt;ref name="F106"&gt;Fougères, p.&amp;nbsp;106.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Each plaque depicts three figures on a blank background. They are juxtaposed simply, without any complicated compositional features.&lt;ref&gt;Rolley, p.&amp;nbsp;254.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Apollo and Marsyas (NAMA 216) ===
At left, the god [[Apollo]] is represented seated, with long hair, wearing a [[chiton]] and [[himation]], and holding a [[kithara]] in his left hand which rests on his left knee. With his right hand he grabs a fold in his himation. At right, [[Marsyas]] is shown with a beard, his left leg bent, playing the [[aulos]] (double flute). In the centre a bearded man is standing, wearing a kind of [[Phrygian cap]], a chiton, and ''anaxyrides'' (trousers), holding a knife in one hand. Based on the identifications of the other two figures, he must be the servant who flays Marsyas after he loses his musical contest against Apollo.

=== Muses (NAMA 215 and 217) ===
The other two plaques represent the Muses, who, in some versions of the myth of Marsyas, were the judges of the contest.&lt;ref&gt;e.g {{HygFab}} (165.4) and [[Libanios]] (14).&lt;/ref&gt; The Muses are differentiated. On NAMA 215, the one on the left holds an aulos, the one in the centre holds the folds of her himation, and the one on the right is seated and plays a little [[string instrument]] - perhaps a [[Bandora (instrument)|bandora]].&lt;ref name="P110" /&gt; On NAMA 217, the left Muse holds some unrolled parchment, the central Muse holds a rolled-up scroll in her left hand, and the right Muse holds up a kithara in her right hand. Canonically, there were nine Muses, so presumably there was a fourth plaque depicting the missing three Muses.&lt;ref name="F106" /&gt;

== Attribution ==
When he published the discovery, Fougères suggested that the three palques decorated the sides of a rectangular pedestal and suggested that they be associated with a passage of [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] who mentions in his description of Mantineia, "a sanctuary of [[Leto]] and her children; it was [[Praxiteles]] who made the statues, two generations after [[Alcamenes]]; on their base there are carvings of a Muse and a Marsyas playing the aulos."&lt;ref&gt;{{PauDes}} (8.9.1). Marion Muller-Dufeu, ''La Sculpture grecque. Sources littéraires et épigraphiques'', Paris, éditions de l'École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts, coll. « Beaux-Arts histoire », 2002 ({{ISBN|2-84056-087-9}}), no 1394, p. 485.&lt;/ref&gt;

This text which has been transmitted mentions only a single Muse and presents a difficulty in that while representations of Marsyas playing the flute with a single [[Maenad]] are common, there are no known representations of Marsyas playing the flute with a single Muse.&lt;ref name="F107"&gt;Fougères, p.&amp;nbsp;107.&lt;/ref&gt; To resolve the problem, it has been suggested that Pausanias, whose descriptions are often very vague, was confused and has mistaken Apollo for a Muse&lt;!-- ! --&gt;. Fougères proposed to emend Μοῦσα (Muse) to Μοῦσαι (Muses), a correction which has been widely accepted since.&lt;ref name="P110" /&gt;

[[File:Mantineia Base.JPG|thumb|Hypothetical reconstruction of the plaques in order to force them to match Pausanias' description.]]
The main objection to this hypothesis concerns the proposed arrangement of the base, with the plaque of Apollo and Marsyas on the front, the plaques of the Muses on the sides.&lt;ref name="F106" /&gt; This would create a base measuring 1.36 x 1.36 metres, which would be too small for the three statues that Pausanias mentions.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Overbeck, ''Berichte der Koniglich Sachsischen Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften'', 1888, p.&amp;nbsp;184ff.&lt;/ref&gt; The three plaques could instead be arranged next to one another, with Apollo and Marsyas in the centre and the Muses on either side, but there are no traces of attachments for connecting the plaques on their sides, which argues against this hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;Ridgway [1997], p.&amp;nbsp;206.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proposed to see the plaques as the decoration for a platform for the competitors of a musical contest which took place every year in Arcadia according to [[Polybius]].&lt;ref&gt;Polybius 4.20.9.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, one of the heads of the Muses of NAMA 217 was recovered from the ruins of the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes N. Svoronos, ''Das Athener Nationalmuseum'', vol. I, Beck und Barth, Athènes, 1908 (German translation of the Greek original of 1903), p.&amp;nbsp;192.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this reconstruction is not supported by any archaeological evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Ridgway [1997], p.&amp;nbsp;207 ; Pasquier, p.&amp;nbsp;111.&lt;/ref&gt;.

The '''''Marburg Journal of Religion''''' is a [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[electronic journal|online]] [[academic journal]] that publishes articles on empirical and theoretical studies of [[religion]]. The first issue having appeared in April 1996. The original concept was developed by [[Michael Pye]] together with his assistant Richard Böhme, who was the first Web Editor. The editorial team was broadened in 1999 to include Peter Antes ([[Hanover|Hannover]]) and [[Andreas Grünschloß]] ([[Göttingen]]) and in 2007 Edith Franke ([[Marburg]]). Doreen Christen became Web Editor in 2002. The first separate Reviews Editor was Monika Schrimpf (from 2001) and this role was taken up by Katja Triplett from 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archiv.ub.uni-marburg.de/ep/0004/about/editorialTeamBio/628]&lt;/ref&gt;

Papers published in the ''Marburg Journal of Religion'' are documented and abstracted in the bibliographical journal ''[[Science of Religion (journal)|Science of Religion]]'', now published by [[Brill Publishers]] in [[Leiden]]. The abstracts published in the ''Marburg Journal of Religion'' itself may be published elsewhere on condition that full documentation of the article is provided.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11785">In [[cultural studies]], '''media culture''' refers to the current [[Western world|Western]] [[capitalist]] society that emerged and developed from the 20th century, under the [[influence of mass media]].&lt;ref name="Jansson2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thoman1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thomas2012p30"/&gt; The term alludes to the overall impact and intellectual guidance exerted by the media (primarily TV, but also the press, radio and cinema), not only on public opinion but also on [[Taste (sociology)|taste]]s and [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]].

The alternative term '''mass culture''' conveys the idea that such culture emerges spontaneously from the masses themselves, like popular art did before the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Adorno (1963) quotation: {{quotation|...the interpretation agreeable to its advocates: that it is a matter of something like a culture that arises spontaneously from the masses themselves, the contemporary form of popular art.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expression media culture, on the other hand, conveys the idea that such culture is the product of the mass media. Another alternative term for media culture is "image culture."&lt;ref name="Jansson2002"&gt;Jansson (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thoman1992"&gt;Thoman (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

Media culture, with its declinations of advertising and public relations, is often considered as a system centered on the manipulation of the mass of society.&lt;ref name="Bignell2007p21"/&gt; [[Corporate media]] "are used primarily to represent and reproduce dominant ideologies."&lt;ref name="Nomai2008p5"&gt;Nomai (2008) [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y4auF2ysN0wC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;lpg=PA5 pp.5], 41&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent in the development of this perspective has been the work of [[Theodor Adorno]] since the 1940s.&lt;ref name="Bignell2007p21"&gt;Bignell (2007) [https://books.google.com/books?id=0lVabD9fYBIC&amp;pg=PA21 pp.21-2]&lt;/ref&gt; Media culture is associated with [[consumerism]], and in this sense called alternatively "consumer culture."&lt;ref name="Jansson2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thomas2012p30"&gt;Thomas (2012) [https://books.google.com/books?id=v76Ksn6vFIIC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;lpg=PA30 p.30] quotation: {{quotation|The twenty-first century Western world, driven by American corporate and consumer ideology, is a perpetual media culture that depends on sound bites and ''the next thing'', leaving the public reduced  to media consumers never allowed time to reflect on the information. Volume and speed have consumed and obliterated nuance, ethics, and accuracy.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
{{Over-quotation|section|date=February 2011}}
{{quote|"[[Popular culture]] and the mass media have a symbiotic relationship: each depends on the other in an intimate collaboration."|K. Turner (1984), p. 4&lt;ref&gt;Shuker, Roy (1994). ''Understanding Popular Music'', p. 4. {{ISBN|0-415-10723-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[news media]] mines the work of [[scientist]]s and [[scholar]]s and conveys it to the [[general public]], often emphasizing elements that have inherent appeal or the power to amaze. For instance, [[giant panda]]s (a species in remote Chinese woodlands) have become well-known items of popular culture; [[intestinal parasite|parasitic worms]], though of greater practical importance, have not. Both scholarly facts and news stories get modified through popular transmission, often to the point of outright falsehoods.

[[Hannah Arendt]]'s 1961 essay "The Crisis in Culture" suggested that a "market-driven media would lead to the displacement of culture by the dictates of [[entertainment]]."&lt;ref name=nomuzak&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nomuzak.co.uk/dumbing_down.html |title=Dumbing down |publisher=Nomuzak.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101029011017/http://nomuzak.co.uk/dumbing_down.html |archivedate=October 29, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Susan Sontag]] argues that in our culture, the most "...intelligible, persuasive values are [increasingly] drawn from the entertainment industries", which has spelt the "undermining of standards of seriousness." As a result, "tepid, the glib, and the senselessly cruel" topics are becoming the norm.&lt;ref name=nomuzak/&gt;
Some critics argue that popular culture is "dumbing down": "newspapers that once ran foreign news now feature celebrity gossip, pictures of scantily dressed young ladies... television has replaced high-quality drama with gardening, cookery, and other "lifestyle" programmes [and] reality TV and asinine soaps," to the point that people are constantly immersed in [[trivia]] about [[celebrity culture]].&lt;ref name=nomuzak/&gt;

According to Altheide and Snow, media culture means that within a culture, the media increasingly influences other institutions (e.g. politics, religion, sports), which become constructed alongside a media logic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Altheide, D. L., &amp; Snow, R. P.|title=Media Logic|date=1979|publisher=Sage|location=Beverly Hills, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1950s, television has been the main medium for molding [[public opinion]].&lt;ref name="Diggs-Brown2011p53"&gt;Diggs-Brown, Barbara (2011) [https://books.google.com/books?id=7c0ycySng4YC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;lpg=PA53 ''Strategic Public Relations: Audience Focused Practice''] p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

In Rosenberg and White's book ''Mass Culture'', [[Dwight Macdonald]] argues that "Popular culture is a debased, trivial culture that voids both the deep realities ([[sex]], [[death]], [[failure]], [[tragedy]]) and also the simple spontaneous pleasures... The masses, debauched by several generations of this sort of thing, in turn come to demand trivial and comfortable cultural products."&lt;ref name=nomuzak/&gt; Van den Haag argues that "all mass media in the end alienate people from personal experience and though appearing to offset it, intensify their moral isolation from each other, from the reality and from themselves."&lt;ref name=nomuzak/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van den Haag, in Bernard Rosenberg and David Manning White, ''Mass Culture'', p. 529.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics have lamented the "replacement of high art and authentic folk culture by tasteless industrialised artefacts [[mass production|produced on a mass scale]] in order to satisfy the [[lowest common denominator]]."&lt;ref name=nomuzak/&gt; This "mass culture emerged after the Second World War and have led to the concentration of mass-culture power in ever larger global media conglomerates." The popular press decreased the amount of news or information and replaced it with entertainment or [[titillation]] that reinforces "fears, [[prejudice]], scapegoating processes, [[paranoia]], and aggression."&lt;ref name=nomuzak/&gt; Critics of television and film have argued that the quality of TV output has been diluted as stations pursue ratings by focusing on the "glitzy, the superficial, and the popular". In film, "Hollywood culture and values" are increasingly dominating film production in other countries. Hollywood films have changed from creating formulaic films which emphasize "shock-value and superficial [[:wikt:thrill|thrill]][s]" and the use of special effects, with themes that focus on the "basic [[instinct]]s of aggression, revenge, violence, [and] greed." The plots "often seem [[simplistic]], a standardized template taken from the shelf, and dialogue is minimal." The "characters are shallow and unconvincing, the dialogue is also simple, unreal, and badly constructed."&lt;ref name=nomuzak/&gt;

More recently, scholars turned to the concept of the [[Mediatization (media)|mediatization]] of culture to address the various processes through which culture is influenced by the modus operandi of the media. On one hand, the media are cultural institutions and artifacts of their own, on the other hand, other domains have become dependent on the media and their various affordances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=S. Hjarvard  |author2=L. N. Petersen|title=Mediatization and cultural change|journal=MedieKultur|date=2013|issue=54|pages=1–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Through religion==
Media culture, in its mass marketing, has been compared to the role of religions in the past. It has been considered as taking the place of the old traditional religions.&lt;ref&gt;from Debord (1977) thesis 20: "The spectacle is the material reconstruction of the religious illusion."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Debord (1967) thesis 25 on the spectacle and the [[sacred]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nomai2008p176"&gt;Nomai (2008) [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y4auF2ysN0wC&amp;pg=PA176 p.176]&lt;/ref&gt; The waves of enthusiasm and fervent exaltation for a given product, a characteristic [[consumerist]] phenomenon, has been compared to the "ecstasies of the convulsions and miracles of the old religious fetishism".&lt;ref name="Thesis67"&gt;Debord (1977) Thesis 67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;from Debord (1977) thesis 132: "The masters who make history their private property, under the protection of myth, possess first of all a private ownership of the mode of illusion: in China and Egypt they long held a monopoly over the immortality of the soul ... The growth of their real historical power goes together with a popularization of the possession of myth and illusion."&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, the [[Catholic Church]], the dominant religious institution in the Western world, has been considered retrospectively as an antecedent and sophisticated form of [[public relations]], [[advertiser]] and [[multinational corporation]], selling its product to a mass of worshipers/consumers.&lt;ref&gt;Ballardini, Bruno (2006) [https://books.google.com/books?id=n1zyAAAACAAJ ''Gesù lava più bianco.

The '''Meher Spiritual Center''' is a {{convert|500|acre|ha|adj=on}} [[Retreat (spiritual)|spiritual retreat]] along the Atlantic Ocean between [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina|Myrtle Beach]] and [[North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina]] and adjacent to [[Briarcliffe Acres, South Carolina|Briarcliffe Acres]].  The Center was established by Elizabeth Chapin Patterson and [[Norina Matchabelli|Princess Norina Matchabelli]] in the early 1940s under the guidance of Indian spiritual master [[Meher Baba]] as ''A place of pilgrimage for all time''.&lt;ref&gt;Purdom, Charles, ''The God-Man: The Life, Journeys &amp; Work of Meher Baba with an Interpretation of His Silence &amp; Spiritual Teaching'', George Allen &amp; Unwin, London, 1964, p. 201&lt;/ref&gt;  Its stated purpose is to exist as a "retreat for rest, meditation, and renewal of the spiritual life.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mehercenter.org/ Mehercenter.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Meher Spiritual Center is also designated as a South Carolina [[Wildlife refuge|wildlife sanctuary]], with more than 200 species of plants, 100 species of birds and 44 species of animals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scwf.org/index.php/education-programs/habitats/community/50-briarcliffe South Carolina Wildlife Federation (retrieved 8-12-2014)]&lt;/ref&gt; The Center has two lakes, many nature trails, and a mile of Atlantic shoreline. The Center has a house built for Meher Baba which is named "Meher Abode" but usually referred to as "Baba's House."  Meher Baba stayed there during his three visits to America in the 1950s.  Meher Baba inaugurated the Meher Center in 1952 and also visited in 1956 and 1958.&lt;ref name="Meher Center History"&gt;[http://www.mehercenter.org/pastandpresent/history.html Meher Center History]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Meher Baba requested that the land for his center in America meet certain criteria. They were: the place must have equitable climate, virgin soil, ample water, soil that could be made self-sustaining to a large number of people, and the property should be given from the heart.&lt;ref&gt;Kalchuri, Bhau, ''Meher Prabu, Lord Meher'', Manifestation, 1986, p. 2951&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth Patterson and Norina Matchabelli originally sought land in other parts of the United States including California. But no land met all the requirements. Eventually Elizabeth Patterson's father, [[Simeon B. Chapin]], who was one of the original developers of Myrtle Beach, gave her the land as a gift. He felt that it was not suitable for his resort plans since its lakes obstructed access to the beach.&lt;ref name="Meher Center History"/&gt;

[[File:MercyBrownGravestone.jpg|thumb|Mercy Brown's gravestone in the cemetery of the [[Baptist Church in Exeter]]]]
The '''Mercy Brown vampire incident''' occurred in [[Rhode Island]], US, in 1892. It is one of the best documented cases of the [[Burial#Exhumation|exhumation]] of a corpse in order to perform [[ritual]]s to banish an [[undead]] manifestation. The incident was part of the wider [[New England vampire panic]].

Several cases of consumption ([[tuberculosis]]) occurred in the family of George and Mary Brown in [[Exeter, Rhode Island]]. Friends and neighbors believed that this was due to the influence of the undead. An attempt was made to remediate.

==History==
In [[Exeter, Rhode Island]], several members of George and Mary Brown's family suffered a sequence of tuberculosis infections in the final two decades of the 19th century. Tuberculosis was called "consumption" at the time and was a devastating and much-feared disease.

The mother, Mary Eliza, was the first to die of the disease, followed in 1883 by their eldest daughter, Mary Olive.&lt;ref name="Tucker" /&gt; In 1891, daughter Mercy and son Edwin also contracted the disease.&lt;ref name="Tucker"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tucker|first=Abigal|date=October 2012|title=The Great New England Vampire Panic|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/The-Great-New-England-Vampire-Panic-169791986.html?c=y&amp;page=3|journal=Smithsonian Magazine|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|volume=|page=3|pages=|accessdate=2018-10-31|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Friends and neighbors of the family believed that one of the dead family members was a [[vampire]] (although they did not use that name) and had caused Edwin's illness. This was in accordance with threads of contemporary [[folklore]] linking multiple deaths in one family to undead activity. Consumption was a poorly understood condition at the time and the subject of much superstition.

George Brown was persuaded to give permission to [[Burial#Exhumation|exhume]] several bodies of his family members.  Villagers, the local doctor, and a newspaper reporter exhumed the bodies on March 17, 1892.&lt;ref name=Tucker /&gt; The bodies of both Mary and Mary Olive exhibited the expected level of [[decomposition]], so they were thought not to be the cause. However, the corpse of a daughter, Mercy, exhibited almost no decomposition.  She still had [[blood]] in the heart. This was taken as a sign that the young woman was undead and the agent of young Edwin's condition. (Her lack of decomposition was more likely due to her body being stored in freezer-like conditions in an above-ground crypt during the two months following her death.) 

As [[superstition]] dictated, Mercy's [[heart]] and [[liver]] were burned, and the ashes were mixed with water to create a [[wikt:tonic#Noun|tonic]] and was given to the sick Edwin to drink, as an effort to resolve his illness and stop the influence of the undead. The young man died two months later.&lt;ref name=Tucker /&gt; What remained of Mercy's body was buried in the cemetery of the [[Baptist Church in Exeter]] after being desecrated.&lt;!---this sentence moved here from above, as it appears to refer to the re-burial rather than the initial burial---&gt;

==Trivia==
The Mercy Brown incident was the inspiration for [[Caitlín R. Kiernan]]'s short story "So Runs the World Away", which makes explicit reference to the affair.  It has also been suggested by scholars that [[Bram Stoker]], the author of the novel ''[[Dracula]]'', knew about the Mercy Brown case through newspaper articles and based the novel's character [[Lucy Westenra]] upon her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Great New England Vampire Panic|url = http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-great-new-england-vampire-panic-36482878/?no-ist=|website = Smithsonian|accessdate = 2015-12-01|date = 2012-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also referred to in  [[H. P. Lovecraft]]'s "[[The Shunned House]]".&lt;ref name="Spiers"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.underworldtales.com/submissions/mercy.htm|title=Mercy Brown: A Real Rhode Island Vampire |last= Spiers| first= Richard| year= 2004|magazine=Underworld Tales Magazine|accessdate=18 June 2011|quote=As Lovecraft's Mercy Dexter character allows the plot to flow, he cagily reveals, "[don't] hire anyone from the Nooseneck Hill country … seat of uncomfortable superstitions.  As lately as 1892, an Exeter community exhumed a dead body and ceremoniously burnt its heart in order to prevent certain alleged visitations."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mercy Brown's story was the inspiration for the young adult novel ''Mercy: The Last New England Vampire'' by Sarah L. Thomson. An account of the events as told by the remaining descendants of Mercy is available in Michael E. Bell's ''Food for the Dead: On the Trail of New England's Vampires''. 

The Mercy Brown incident is depicted in the 2015 film ''[[Almost Mercy]]'', written by rapper [[B. Dolan]] and [[Tom DeNucci]]. Directed by DeNucci, the film stars [[Bill Moseley]] and [[Kane Hodder]]. The film's main characters Emily (played by Danielle Guldin) and Jackson (Jesse Dufault) visit the grave of Mercy Brown and call themselves the "Friends of Mercy". In a [[flashback (continuity)|flashback]] sequence, the film's characters from the present day appear as characters in the story of Mercy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tommy DeNucci's 'Almost Mercy' Coming to VOD this May|url = http://www.horror-asylum.com/news/article.asp?item=11507|website = The Horror Asylum| accessdate = 2015-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; B. Dolan also wrote a song from the perspective of a fictitious party involved in the case in his song "The Hunter" from his 2010 album ''[[Fallen House, Sunken City]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = B. Dolan - The Hunter Lyrics|url = http://songmeanings.com/songs/view/3530822107858819829/|website = SongMeanings| accessdate = 2015-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mercy Brown story was the main subject of the first episode of the ''[[Lore (podcast)|Lore]]'' podcast in 2015, as well as the first episode of the [[Lore (TV series)|television adaptation of the same name]] in 2017.

Tall Munbāqa (also Ekalte ('''Mumbaqat''')) is a 5,000-year-old town complex in northern [[Syria]] now lying in ruins. The ruins are located on the east bank, on a steep slope, of the upper course of the [[Euphrates]]. In the 3rd and 2nd millennium BC the city was an important city-state in the region. Due to the establishment of the [[Tabqa Dam]] at [[Al-Thawrah]], 35 kilometers west of [[Raqqa]], the city ruins are partially flooded today by [[Lake Assad]]. Situated high above the steep drop of the eastern shore, Tall Munbāqa is still preserved.


==History==
The Euphrates was one of the highways, the Asia with the Mediterranean combined. Of course one of the main trade routes between the Sumerian and later Babylonian centers of power and the Syrian coastal cities and the immediate access to the main navigable river can be considered as one of the basic motives for founding this city. Trade was driving to urban planning. Town authorities and city destruction characterize the Urbanisationsfieber of the 3rd and 2nd millennium BC in northern Syria, where the river from the Armenian highlands turns to the south-east, 200&amp;nbsp;km from the nearby Mediterranean were major trading centers. From there, the road passes over the northern Syrian plateau of [[Aleppo]]. Starting from the 4th millennium BC, Sumerian trading sites are detectable here. In the 3rd millennium, the height of the cultural and economic development, according to the model developed chiefdom Sumerian cities. The Old Syrian kingdom reached the 2nd millennium BC to the Euphrates. The Mitannistaat the Hurrians dominated a few centuries out the northeast of the modern-day Syria to the Euphrates. In the 14th century BC ruled the Hittites northern Syria and the Euphrates was the boundary area between the Assyrian and Hittite Empire. Around 1200 BC settled the Syrians on the [[Euphrat]]es. This eventful history may be seen from the numerous ruins of hills along the 90&amp;nbsp;km long reservoir. One of the largest excavated ruins of this ancient cultural landscape Tall Munbāqa.

==Archaeology==
In 1907, the English explorers [[William M. Ramsay]] and [[Gertrude Bell]] discovered the ruins, drew up a plan and described the ramparts: "Munbayah where my tents were pitched - the Arabic name means only a high-altitude course - was probably the Bersiba in Ptolemy's list of city names. It consists of a double ramparts, situated on the river bank." Though Bell was wrong in the localization of Bersiba, she did recognize the importance of the mound for the study of the oriental city. 

The 400 m x 500 m, rectangular town ruins, once strongly fortified, were documented and investigated 1964, on the occasion of the inspection of the area for a proposed reservoir. The German Oriental Society requested an excavation permit for the mound in 1968. In 1969-1970, Ernst Heinrich of the [[Berlin Institute of Technology]] measured the visible remains and in 1971 the excavation of these remains were carried out. In 1973 and 1974, excavations were led by [[Winfried Orthmann]] and in 1977 by [[Alfred Werner Maurer]], both of the [[University of Saarbrücken]].&lt;ref&gt;W. Orthmann, Hartmut Kühne, ''Mumbaqat 1973, Vorläufiger Bericht über die von der Deutschen Orient-Gesellschaft mit Mitteln der Stiftung Volkswagenwerk unternommenen Ausgrabungen'', In: MDOG, pp. 53–97, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;*W.

März 1978 in Berlin Schloss Charlottenburg&lt;/ref&gt;From 1979 on Dittmar Machule of the [[Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg]] was the director. During the excavations in 1973, 1974 and 1977 up to 16 scientists and 90 local workers were involved in the excavations. Thanks to the discovery of 15 Late Bronze Age clay tablets mentioning the name of the city, it is now believed that it was known in this period as "Ekalte" and it has been suggested that earlier, in the Old Babylonian period, the city bore the name Yakaltum.&lt;ref&gt;Wu Yuhong, N.A.B.U. 1992/51, [[Dominique Charpin]], N.A.B.U. 1993/32&lt;/ref&gt;

Excavation was resumed in 1999 and continued in six seasons until 2010 under Machule and Felix Blocher.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19377">{{History of Greece}}
The '''National Schism''' ({{lang-el|Εθνικός Διχασμός}}, ''Ethnikos Dikhasmos'', sometimes called '''The Great Division''') was a series of disagreements between [[Constantine I of Greece|King Constantine I]] and [[Prime Minister]] [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] regarding the foreign policy of [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]] in the period of 1910–1922 of which the tipping point was whether Greece should enter [[World War I]]. Venizelos was in support of the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] and wanted Greece to join the war on their side, while the pro-[[German Empire|German]] King wanted Greece to remain neutral, which would favor the plans of the [[Central Powers]].

The disagreement had wider implications, since it would also affect the character and role of the king in the state. The dismissal of Venizelos by the King resulted in a deep personal rift between the two and in subsequent events their followers divided into two radically opposed political camps affecting the wider Greek society.

With the contrary actions of Venizelos permitting the landing of Allied forces in [[Thessaloniki]] and the unconditional surrender of a military fort in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] to German-Bulgarian forces by the king, the disagreements of the two men started to take the form of [[civil war]]. In August 1916, followers of Venizelos set up a provisional state in Northern Greece, with Entente support, with the aim of reclaiming the lost regions in Macedonia, effectively splitting Greece into two entities. After intense diplomatic negotiations and [[Noemvriana|an armed confrontation]] in [[Athens]] between Allied and royalist forces the king abdicated on 11 June 1917, and his second son [[Alexander of Greece|Alexander]] took his place.

Venizelos returned to Athens on 29 May 1917 and Greece, now unified, officially [[Greece in World War I|joined the war]] on the side of the Allies, emerging victorious and securing new territory by the [[Treaty of Sèvres]]. The bitter effects of this division were the main features of Greek political life until the 1940s, and contributed to Greece's defeat in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922)|Greco-Turkish War]], the collapse of the [[Second Hellenic Republic]] and the establishment of the dictatorial [[Metaxas Regime]].

==Source of the conflict==
{{Details |Goudi coup}}

The main cause of the conflict was the dispute between Venizelos and King Constantine over power in Greece, in which the development of true representation had been slow since the creation of the state. Up till the 1870s and the King's acceptance of the principle that the leader of the [[majority party]] in Parliament should be given the mandate to form a government, the formation of political groupings around a leader who could govern if this pleased the King meant that the supposedly [[parliamentary government]] was actually at the monarch's discretion.{{Sfn | Koliopoulos | 2002 | p = 53}}

Many reformists and liberals viewed meddling by the monarchy in politics as deleterious. The negative public attitude towards the monarchy was strengthened by the defeat of the Greek army, headed by Constantine (then the [[Crown Prince]]), in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco-Turkish War of 1897]]. Many of these hopes for reform were also shared by young officers in the [[Hellenic Army]], who felt humiliated by the defeat, and who were influenced by [[republicanism]].

A "[[Military League]]" was formed, and on 15 August 1909, they issued a [[pronunciamiento]] at the Goudi barracks in Athens. The movement, which demanded reforms in government and military affairs, was widely supported by the public; [[King George I of Greece|King George]] was forced to give in to the military's demands. He appointed [[Kyriakoulis Mavromichalis]] as Prime Minister and accepted the dismissal of the Princes from the military.

However, it soon became apparent that the leadership of the League was not able to govern the country, and they looked for an experienced political leader, who would also preferably be anti-monarchist and not tainted by the "old-partyism" of the old system. The officers found such a man in the person of [[Eleftherios Venizelos]], a prominent [[Crete|Cretan]] politician, whose clashes with [[Prince George of Greece|Prince George]], the island's [[regent]], seemed to confirm his anti-monarchist and republican credentials.

With Venizelos' arrival, the League was sidelined, and the energetic and relatively young politician soon dominated Greek political life. His government carried out a large number of overdue reforms, including the creation of a revised [[Greek Constitution of 1911|constitution]]. However, he also established a close relationship with the King, resisted calls to transform the revisionary assembly into a constitutional one, and even reinstated the Princes in their positions in the army, with Crown Prince Constantine as its Inspector-General.

===Balkan Wars (1912–13)===
{{Further |Balkan Wars|Greece in the Balkan Wars}}
With the outbreak of the [[Balkan Wars]], Constantine was immediately appointed again as [[commander-in-chief]], and the successes of the army in the field, especially in the [[Second Balkan War]] against the [[Bulgaria]]ns, helped many forget his record in 1897. Constantine, now king, was being hailed as "laurel-crowned" and "Bulgar-slayer". It was however during this war that the first tension between Constantine and Venizelos surfaced, in a dispute over the army's course following the victory at [[Battle of Sarantaporo|Sarantaporo]]. Constantine wanted to march due north, towards [[Monastir, Macedonia|Monastir]], while Venizelos was anxious that the army should turn east, towards the strategically important city and harbor of [[Thessaloniki]].

The anxiety of Venizelos was doubled by the fact that the Bulgarians had also set their eyes on the city, the most important in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], and were sending their own troops towards it. Eventually Venizelos prevailed, and the Greeks captured the city only a few hours before the arrival of the Bulgarians. This episode was not publicised at the time, and in the aftermath of the Wars, the two men, King and Prime Minister, both wildly popular, were seen as making up a formidable partnership at the helm of the Greek state.

==Beginning of the conflict==
[[File:Constantineiofgreece.jpg|right|thumb|180px|King Constantine I in German Field Marshal's uniform. He judged that Greece's interests were best served by remaining neutral in the First World War.]]

As the [[World War I|Great War]] began, the Greek authorities had to choose between [[Neutral country|neutrality]] and aligning themselves with the [[Triple Entente|Allied forces]]. Outright participation in the war on the side of the [[Central Powers]] was not an option, both because of Greece's vulnerability to the [[Royal Navy]] and because, from early on (October 1914), Greece's traditional enemy, the [[Ottoman Empire]], had joined in on Germany's side. Hence, neutrality was the course favored by most pro-German Greeks, including the senior, German-educated, leadership of the General Staff, who had great influence over the King.

King Constantine's German affiliations were exaggerated in the Entente's propaganda during the war. It is true that [[Sophia of Prussia|Queen Sofia]] was the sister of the German [[Kaiser]], [[William II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]], and Constantine himself had been educated in Germany and admired German culture. On the other hand he was descended on his father's side from the Glucksbergs of Denmark and on his mother's side from the Romanovs of Russia, spoke perfect English, was a frequent visitor to England and had relatives there. 

Greece had an ongoing mutual defense pact with [[Serbia]], a member of the [[Triple Entente|Allied forces]], who were asking for support after they were invaded by [[Austria-Hungary]] (see [[Serbian Campaign (World War I)]]).
However, Constantine believed it was in the greater interests of Greece to remain neutral. His considerable military experience and knowledge made him especially conscious of the threat to Greece from Bulgaria's powerful military in the event that the Hellenic Army was engaged in a war with Austria-Hungary. The Prime Minister, Venizelos, was strongly in favor of joining the Entente, as he believed that Greece would gain new lands and fulfill the [[Megali Idea]].

In January 1915, in an attempt to convince the Greeks to side with them, [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] offered Greece post-war concessions in [[Asia Minor]] (currently part of Turkey). Venizelos felt this was very much in Greece's interests and attempted to force a [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] through the Greek parliament to join the Allies. He also adivsed King Constantine to convene the [[Crown Council of Greece|Crown Council]], which he did. It met twice, on [[Crown Council of Greece meeting of 18 February 1915|February 18]] and on [[Crown Council of Greece meeing of 20 February 1915|February 20]]. In these meetings, Venizelos presented his case for joining the Entente, a course of action which was opposed by opposition leader Theotokis, but Rallis supported. Staunch opposition by the King, Army generals (including the General Staff and [[Ioannis Metaxas]]) and their supporters, forced Venizelos to resign shortly afterwards (on March, 6).

==The clash and schism of Greece==

[[File:Ελευθέριος Βενιζέλος.jpg|thumb|left|Eleftherios Venizelos, the Greek Prime Minister, believed that Greece's interests were best served by entering the war on the side of the Allies.]]
The resignation caused political dissension in Greece, a diplomatic battle between the King and Venizelos' supporters forced a [[Greek legislative election, May 1915|general election in June 1915]]. These elections were won by Venizelos' [[Liberal Party (Greece)|Liberal Party]] and he resumed his post as Prime Minister, however Constantine refused to ratify the appointment of the new government until August.

During this time the [[Serbia]]n-[[Bulgaria]]n conflict deepened until Bulgaria declared war on Serbia, which posed an immediate threat to the newly gained province of [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]], including the strategically important port of [[Thessaloniki]].
Venizelos asked Constantine for permission to formalize a defense treaty with Serbia in the interests of protecting the Greek border from direct Bulgarian attack. Constantine agreed but only on the condition that Greece was actually attacked. After his inability to sway Constantine to act against Bulgaria, Venizelos took a new route by allowing [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] and French troops to land in Thessaloniki, Macedonia in aid of Serbia, after their failed operation at [[Gallipoli]]. This caused disarray in the Greek government and Venizelos took advantage of this by forcing through a parliamentary motion (with a 37-vote margin) to declare war on Bulgaria.

The invitation to the Allies by Venizelos enraged the King. The dispute between the Greek Prime Minister and the King reached its height shortly after and the King invoked the Greek [[constitution]]al right that gave the monarch the right to dismiss a government. In December 1915 Constantine forced Venizelos to resign for a second time and dissolved the Liberal-dominated parliament, calling a [[Greek legislative election, December 1915|new election]]. Venizelos left [[Athens]] and moved back to his native [[Crete]].

The Liberals boycotted this second election, which undermined the new [[Monarchism|Royalist]] government's position, as it was seen as a government directly appointed by the King, disregarding popular opinion. The tension between the two parties grew gradually over the course of the following year with both sides taking a more radical and divisive approach to the situation. Public opinion was not nearly as clearly divided during this period. When French and British forces landed in [[Thessaloniki]] (as invited by Venizelos earlier) against Constantine's wishes the Greek people supported the King's view that the Allies had violated the country's sovereignty. However, later on, when the [[Central Powers]] took control of eastern Macedonia in May 1916, the public took similar outrage at the King's inability to defend Greek territory.

[[File:French troops in Athens, 1916.png|thumb|French troops in Athens, with the Acropolis in the background, after the ''Noemvriana''.]]

August 30, 1916, saw a [[coup]] against the Royalist government by ''[[Movement of National Defence|Ethniki Amyna]]'' (Εθνική Άμυνα, ''National Defence''), a secret pro-Venizelist military organization based in Thessaloniki. The coup succeeded to the extent that a second provisional government of Greece was formed by the group in Thessaloniki. With the backing of the Entente, Venizelos returned to the Greek mainland from [[Crete]] to lead the new provisional government at the head of a [[triumvirate]]. He declared: "we are not against the King, but against the Bulgarians". Towards the end of 1916 France and Britain, after failing to persuade the royalist government to enter the war too, officially recognized the ''Ethniki Amyna'' government as the lawful government of Greece.

In retaliation against ''Ethniki Amyna'' a royalist [[paramilitary]] unit called the "Reservists" (Επίστρατοι) was formed. Led by Colonel [[Ioannis Metaxas]] (one of Constantine's closest aides and a future dictator of Greece) the group targeted Venizelist people in [[Athens]] and nearby areas, culminating in the ''[[Noemvriana]]'', the "November events", which were ignited by an armed confrontation between Greek reservists and French marines.

Ιn retaliation, the Venizelos National Defence Government and the Entente instituted a naval blockade, seized the royalist fleet and demanded the partial disarmament of the royalist forces and their withdrawal to the [[Peloponnese]]. 

The monarchists blamed Venizelos for having the idea of the blockade. It lasted 106 days in total, during which time no goods were allowed to enter or leave royalist-controlled ports that were under the control of the Athens government. This was to set a precedent for much of the future conflict in Greece.

==Greece joins the war==
{{Details |Macedonian front}}
[[File:Venizelos WWI 1918.jpg|thumb|Venizelos reviews a section of the Greek army on the Macedonian front during the First World War, 1918. He is accompanied by Admiral [[Pavlos Kountouriotis]] (left) and General [[Maurice Sarrail]] (right).]]

The Venizelist-Entente blockade eventually succeeded in its aim. In June 1917, after threats to bombard Athens if the King remained, Constantine left Greece leaving the Crown to his second son [[Alexander of Greece|Alexander]]. Venizelos took control of the government and pledged Greek support to the Entente. In July the country officially declared war on the Central Powers. During the remaining 18 months of the war 10 divisions of the Greek army fought alongside the [[Triple Entente|Allied forces]] against Bulgarian and German forces in Macedonia and Bulgaria. During the conflict Greek forces participated in many victorious battles losing approximately 5,000 troops.

==Consequences==

The act of entering the war and the preceding events resulted in a deep political and social division in post-World War I Greece. The country's foremost political formations, the Venizelist Liberals and the Royalists, already involved in a long and bitter rivalry over pre-war politics, reached a state of outright hatred towards each other. Both parties viewed the other's actions during the [[World War I|First World War]] as politically illegitimate and treasonous.

This enmity inevitably spread throughout Greek society, creating a deep rift that contributed decisively to the [[Asia Minor Disaster]] and resulted in continued political and military unrest in the interwar years during the troubled [[Second Hellenic Republic]]. The National Schism was also one of the principal causes that led to the collapse of the Republic and the institution of the dictatorial [[4th of August Regime]] in 1936.

The division between Royalists and Venizelists even came to the United States and elsewhere with the Greek immigrants of that generation: immigrants favouring the two political camps would settle in nearby but carefully separated communities in American cities, often centred on competing Greek Orthodox parishes. In some cases, the animosity and mistrust between such parishes has survived into the 21st century, long after the original political disagreement was forgotten.

'''Neo-feudalism''' or '''new feudalism''' refers to a theorized contemporary rebirth of policies of [[governance]], [[economy]], and public life reminiscent of those present in many [[feudalism|feudal]] societies, such as unequal rights and legal protections for common people and for nobility.&lt;ref name=Huggins /&gt;

The concept of "neofeudalism" may focus on economics. Among the issues claimed to be associated with the idea of neofeudalism in contemporary society are [[class stratification]], [[globalization]], mass immigration/illegal immigration, [[open border]]s policies, [[multinational corporation]]s, and "[[corporatism|neo-corporatism]]".&lt;ref&gt;'''Thom Hartmann''', "[http://www.commondreams.org/views/2002/11/06/time-remove-bananas-and-return-our-republic-democracy Time to Remove the Bananas...and Return Our Republic to Democracy]", ''CommonDreams.org'', 6 November 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use and etymology==
In early use, the term was deployed as both a criticism of the political Left and of the Right.

An early example critical of the Left the essay 'Neo-Feudalism' by [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] published in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Reisman]] ''Human Events'', February 1961 [http://www.mises.org/web/2793]&lt;/ref&gt; The term is still used by some on the right in that sense in the twenty-first century:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Although he would later become a naturalized American citizen, Soros remains in social outlook very much a European and believer in the paternalistic neo-feudalism euphemistically called "[[democratic socialism]]" or "[[social democracy]]."&lt;ref&gt;Lowell Ponte, "[http://archive.frontpagemag.com/readArticle.aspx?ARTID=15491 George Soros: Billionaire for the Left] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170824094507/http://archive.frontpagemag.com/readArticle.aspx?ARTID=15491 |date=2017-08-24 }}" ''Front Page Magazine'', November 13, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the other hand, [[Jürgen Habermas]] used the term ''Refeudalisierung'' ('[[refeudalisation]]') in his 1962 ''[[The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere]]'' to criticise the privatisation of the forms of communication that he believed had produced an [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]-era [[public sphere]]. While not talking about 'neo-feudalism' as such, later commentators have noted that these ideas are similar to the idea of neo-feudalism.&lt;ref&gt;Sighard Neckel, ‘[http://www.mpifg.de/pu/workpap/wp10-6.pdf Refeudalisierung der Ökonomie: Zum Strukturwandel kapitalistischer Wirtschaft]’, MPIfG Working Paper 10/6 (Cologne: Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies, July 2010), pp. 11-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Correspondingly, in 1992 [[Immanuel Wallerstein]] expressed views on global development, listing neo-feudalism among three other variants. By ''neo-feudalism'', Wallerstein referred to [[autarky]] regions with a localised hierarchy and hi-tech goods available only for elite.&lt;ref&gt;Wallerstein I. Capitalist civilization. -Binghampton (N.Y.), 1992. &lt;br/&gt; {{cite journal |author= Malinovsky P.

According to Les Johnston, Clifford Shearing's theoretical approach of neofeudalism has been influential.&lt;ref name=Johnston1999&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Johnston |first1=Les |year=1999 |doi=10.1023/A:1008753326991 |title=Private Policing in Context |journal=European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=175–196}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shearing "use[s] this term in a limited sense to draw attention to the emergence of domains of mass private property that are ‘gated’ in a variety of ways".&lt;ref name=Shearing2001&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shearing |first1=Clifford |year=2001 |title=Punishment and the Changing Face of the Governance |journal= Punishment &amp; Society |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages= 203–220 |doi= 10.1177/1462474501003002001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shearing1983&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shearing |first1=Clifford D. |year=1983 |title=Private Security: Implications for Social Control |journal=[[Social Problems]] |volume=30 |issue=5 |pages=493–506 |url=http://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=89492 |issn=0037-7791 |doi=10.1525/sp.1983.30.5.03a00020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucia Zedner responds that this use of neo-feudalism is ''too'' limited in scope; Shearing's comparison does not draw parallels with earlier governance explicitly enough. Zedner prefers more definitive endorsements.&lt;ref name=Zedner2006&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zedner |first1=Lucia |authorlink=Lucia Zedner |year=2006 |title=Policing Before and After the Police: The Historical Antecedents of Contemporary Crime Control |doi=10.1093/bjc/azi043 |journal=The British Journal of Criminology |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=78–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neofeudalism entails an order defined by commercial interests and administered in large areas, according to Bruce Baker, who argues that this does not fully describe the extent of cooperation between state and non-state policing.&lt;ref name=Baker2004&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baker |first1=Bruce |year=2004 |title=Protection from crime: what is on offer for Africans? |journal=Journal of Contemporary African Studies |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=165–188 |doi=10.1080/cjca0258900042000230005 |url=http://www.ssrnetwork.net/uploaded_files/3606.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317005318/http://www.ssrnetwork.net/uploaded_files/3606.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The significance of the comparison to feudalism, for Randy Lippert and Daniel O'Connor, is that corporations have power similar to states' governance powers.&lt;ref name=Lippert2006&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lippert |first1=Randy |authorlink1=Randy K. Lippert |last2=O'Connor |first2=Daniel |year=2006 |doi=10.1080/10439460500399445 |title=Security Intelligence Networks and the Transformation of Contract Private Security |journal=Policing &amp; Society |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=50–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Sighard Neckel has argued that the rise of financial-market-based capitalism in the later twentieth century has represented a 'refeudalisation' of the economy.&lt;ref&gt;Sighard Neckel, ‘[http://www.mpifg.de/pu/workpap/wp10-6.pdf Refeudalisierung der Ökonomie: Zum Strukturwandel kapitalistischer Wirtschaft]’, MPIfG Working Paper 10/6 (Cologne: Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies, July 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

The widening of the wealth gap, as poor and marginalized people are excluded from the state's provision of security, can result in neofeudalism, argues Marina Caparini, who says this has already happened in [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name=Caparini2006&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Caparini |first=Marina |editor-first=Alan |editor-last=Bryden |editor2-first=Marina |editor2-last=Caparini |encyclopedia=Private Actors and Security Governance |title=Applying a Security Governance Perspective to the Privatisation of Security |url=http://kms1.isn.ethz.ch/serviceengine/Files/ISN/96894/ichaptersection_singledocument/D52C839B-6A34-48DD-98E1-BE33926FCE17/en/chapter14.pdf |year=2006 |publisher=LIT Verlag |isbn=3-8258-9840-7 |pages=263–282 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319221311/http://kms1.isn.ethz.ch/serviceengine/Files/ISN/96894/ichaptersection_singledocument/D52C839B-6A34-48DD-98E1-BE33926FCE17/en/chapter14.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Neofeudalism is made possible by the [[commodification]] of policing, and signifies the end of shared citizenship, says Ian Loader.&lt;ref name=Loader1999&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Loader |first1=Ian |year=1999 |doi=10.1177/S003803859900022X |title=Consumer Culture and the Commodification of Policing and Security |journal=Sociology |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=373–392}}&lt;/ref&gt; A primary characteristic of neofeudalism is that individuals' public lives are increasingly governed by business corporations, as Martha K. Huggins finds.&lt;ref name=Huggins&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Huggins |first1=Martha K. |year=2000 |title=Urban Violence and Police Privatization in Brazil: Blended Invisibility |journal=Social Justice |volume=27 |issue=2 |url=http://intranet.ukzn.ac.za/geog/ugrad/level3/hc_sust_cities/readings/8_URBAN%20VULNERABILITIES/Huggins,%20M.K.%202000.doc |issn=1043-1578 }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Braithwaite notes that neofeudalism brings a different approach to governance, since business corporations in particular have this specialized need for loss reduction.&lt;ref name=Braithwaite2000&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Braithwaite |first1=John |author1-link=John Braithwaite (criminologist) |year=2000 |doi=10.1093/bjc/40.2.222 |url=http://www.anu.edu.au/fellows/jbraithwaite/_documents/Articles/New_Regulatory_2000.pdf |title=The New Regulatory State and the Transformation of Criminology |journal=The British Journal of Criminology |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=222–238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
In the wake of the [[2008 financial crisis]], Seattle-based technology billionaire [[Nick Hanauer]] prominently stated that "our country [i.e. the USA] is rapidly becoming less a capitalist society and more a feudal society".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/06/the-pitchforks-are-coming-for-us-plutocrats-108014.html|title=The Pitchforks Are Coming… For Us Plutocrats|author=Nick Hanauer|publisher=Politico Magazine|date=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His views were echoed by, amongst others, the Icelandic billionaire [[Björgólfur Thor Björgólfsson]].&lt;ref&gt;Thor Bjorgolfsson and Andrew Cave. ''Billions to Bust—and Back: How I Made, Lost, and Rebuilt a Fortune, and What I Learned on the Way''. London: Profile, 2014. p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that the early twentieth-century [[Útrás|boom]] and [[2008 Icelandic financial crisis|bust]] in Iceland saw the country returning to feudal structures of power was also expressed by a range of Icelandic novellists, among them [[Sigrún Davíðsdóttir]] in ''[[Samhengi hlutanna]]'', [[Bjarni Bjarnason]] in ''[[Mannorð]]'', [[Bjarni Harðarson]] in ''Sigurðar saga fóts'', [[Böðvar Guðmundsson]] in ''[[Töfrahöllin]]'', and [[Steinar Bragi]] in ''[[Hálendið: Skáldsaga]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Alaric Hall, '[http://dx.doi.org/10.17613/M6V97ZR22 ''Fornaldarsögur'' and Financial Crisis: Bjarni Bjarnason’s ''Mannorð'']', in ''The Legendary Legacy: Transmission and Reception of the 'Fornaldarsögur Norðurlanda''', ed. by Matthew Driscoll, Silvia Hufnagel, Philip Lavender and Beeke Stegmann, The Viking Collection, 24 (Odense: University Press of Southern Denmark, 2018), pp. 351-75 (pp. 357-60, 374-75).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Boyes, Roger. ''Meltdown Iceland: Lessons on the World Financial Crisis from a Small Bankrupt Island''. New York: Bloomsbury, 2009. p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar ideas are found in some Anglophone fiction.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, Amy S., `Our Future is our Past: Corporate Medievalism in Dystopian Fiction', in &lt;i&gt;Corporate Medievalism II&lt;/i&gt;, ed. by Karl Fugelso, Studies in Medievalism, 22 (Cambridge: Brewer, 2013), pp. 11--19.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''[[Dune (franchise)|Dune]]'' series of novels is set in the distant future with a neofeudalistic galactic empire known as the Imperium after the [[Butlerian Jihad]] which prohibits all kinds of thinking machine technology, even its simpler forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1712">'''Nexus grammar''' is a system of analysing text which was first used in [[Denmark]]. It was a system that was heavily advanced by the Danish Linguist [[Otto Jespersen]]. It most often refers to the relationship between the action and the subject in the sentence. This system has been developed to include symbols for most parts of speech.

==Examples==
  The ball dropped.
       X     O

The X in the sentence refers to the subject while the O refers to the action.

  The boy is happy
       X  O   (x)

The X and O are still the same but the brackets round the (x) tell the reader it is the subject's predicate.

[[File:Commode MET DP105696.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Commode decoration by [[Charles Cressent]] (1745-49), Metropolitan Museum]]

'''Rocaille''' was a French style of exuberant decoration, with an abundance of curves, counter-curves, undulations and elements modeled on nature,  that appeared in furniture and interior decoration during the early reign of [[Louis XV of France]]. It was a reaction against the heaviness and formality of the [[Style Louis XIV]]. It began in about 1710,   reached its peak in the 1730s, and came to an end in the late 1750s, replaced by [[neoclassicism]].&lt;ref&gt;Larousse Encyclopedia on-line&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Lovreglio|2006|page=369}} It was the beginning of the French [[baroque]] movement in furniture and design, and also marked the beginning of the [[Rococo]] movement, which spread to Italy,  Bavaria and Austria by the mid-18th century.

Rocaille was exuberant and inspired by nature like Rococo, but, unlike Rococo, it was usually symmetrical and not overloaded with decoration. It took its name from the mixture of rock, seashell and plaster that was used to create a picturesque effect in [[grottos]] during the Renaissance, and from the name of a seashell-shaped ornament which was frequent feature of Rocaille decoration. {{Sfn|Ducher|1988|page=136}}  In 1736 the designer and jeweler Jean Mondon published the ''Premier Livre de forme rocquaille et cartel'',  a collection of designs for ornaments of furniture and interior decoration. It was the first appearance in print of the term  "rocaille" to designate the style.&lt;ref&gt;De Morant, Henry, ''Histoire des arts décoratifs'', p. 355&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The style was used particularly in salons, a new style of room designed to impress and entertain guests.  The most prominent example was the salon of the Princess in [[Hôtel de Soubise]] in Paris, designed by [[Germain Boffrand]] and [[Charles-Joseph Natoire]] (1735–40). The characteristics of French Rococo included exceptional artistry, especially in the complex frames made for mirrors and paintings, which sculpted in plaster and often gilded; sinuous curves and counter-cures, and the use of vegetal forms (vines, leaves, flowers) intertwined in complex designs. The leading furniture designers in the style included [[Juste-Aurele Meissonier]] and [[Charles Cressent]], along with the wood craftsman [[Nicolas Pineau]].&lt;ref name="Kleiner2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kleiner|first=Fred|title=Gardner's art through the ages: the western perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IJrN8rDirxkC&amp;pg=PA587|accessdate=21 February 2011|year=2010|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-495-57355-5|pages=583–584}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Furniture==
Rocaille decoration was heavily loaded with decoration modeled on seashells, cascades of leaves and flowers, palm leaves, and other natural elements.  The decor on walls and furniture was usually made of carved wood or plaster which was gilded.  The French designer Bernard Toro produced a book of flamboyant early Rocaille patterns in 1716 which was widely circulated in Europe.  The first major craftsman in the style was [[Juste-Aurèle Meissonnier]], followed by [[Jean Bérain the Elder]], [[Gilles-Marie Oppenordt]], [[Nicolas Pineau]], and the sculptor-modelers [[Thomas Germain]], [[Jacques Caffieri]], and the German [[Jean-Claude Duplessis]].  {{Sfn|Lovreglio|2006|page=369}}

The master cabinet makers or ''ébénistes'' of rocaille furniture included [[Mathieu Criaerd]] (1689-1776), who became a master in 1738. He was particularly known both for his fine marquetry or inlay, and for his chests with a Chinese or Japanese theme, with fine Chinese lacquer or Martin varnish, and ornaments of gilded and sculpted bronze. .{{Sfn|Lovreglio|2006|page=128}}

Another important figure of the rocaille style was the ébéntiste [[Charles Cressent]] (1685-1768), who was a master craftsman both in the guild of wood carvers and bronze ornament sculptors, a rare accomplishment earned respectively in 1708 and 1714. Cressent made furniture not only for Louis XV, but also for the King of Portugal and for the Elector of Bavaria. He is best known for his commodes, book cases and desks,which were often inlaid with rosewood and violet wood and equipped with particularly fine rocaille ornament of gilded bronze,  including infants intermingled with birds and cascading vegetation. He introduced several stylistic innovations, including the ''espagnolettes à aigrette'', small busts of young women, applied to the corners of his commodes and desks.  This became a common decoration used by other masters of the rocaille.{{Sfn|Lovreglio|2006|page=127}}

Other notable furniture craftsmen included the members of the Cresson family, Louis Cresson (1706-1761), Rene Cresson (1705-49) and [[Michel Cresson]] (1709–81), all of whom provided exceptionally crafted chairs, armoires, commodes and other furnishings for royal residences.  Their children also became ''menuisiers'' and ''ebenistes'' during the reign of Louis XVI.  .{{Sfn|Lovreglio|2006|page=128}}

==Woodwork and interior decoration==
Rocaille decoration was common in the wooden wall panels and other interior decoration between 1730 and 1750. The trim was usually made of carved and gilded wood or stucco against a white background. The panels in the frames often also had decorative painting, usually of [[arabesques]] or colorful floral patterns, and often featured animals or exotic subjects, set in China, Japan, or Turkey.

==Silver, porcelain and metalwork==
Besides its use in furniture, the style appeared in porcelain and metalwork.  In 1738, the [[Vincennes porcelain|Manufacture de Vincennes]] was founded, thanks to the support of [[Louis XV]] and [[Madame de Pompadour]], in order to compete with the manufactories at [[Chantilly porcelain|Chantilly]] and [[Meissen porcelain|Meissen]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18043925/ Sèvres Porcelain Manufactory | People | Collection of Smithsonian Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1756, the manufactury was moved to a building in Sèvres, built at the initiative of Madame de Pompadour, near her [[Château de Bellevue, France|château]].

The most remarkable rocaille metal work included the cast iron and gilded fences and gates created by iron maker Jean Lamour for the new [[Place Stanislas]] in [[Nancy, France|Nancy]] between 1750 and 1758 as the Duchy of Lorraine was attached to France.  The square was completed with an ensemble of buildings whose balconies and suspended lamps which matched the grillwork of the fence and gates. {{Sfn|De Morant|1970|page=376}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Influence and decline==
The Rocaille influenced the [[Thomas Chippendale|Chippendale]] style in England, and the work of the Belgian-born Bavarian decorative artist [[François de Cuvilliés]].  The style also became very popular for a time in Italy, particularly in Venice, and spread to Austria, Bavaria and Spain, where it took on a more exuberant and overcharged form.

The discoveries of Greek antiquities beginning in 1738 at [[Herculanum]] and especially at [[Pompeii]] in 1748 turned French architecture in the direction of the more symmetrical and less flamboyant neo-classicism and the [[Louis XV style]].  Furniture and decoration became more geometric; furniture legs became straight, resembling Roman or Grecian columns, and the ornate carving on the exterior of furniture was increasingly replaced by fine inlays of multicolored wood.

A '''skunked term''' is a word that becomes difficult to use because it is [[Semantic change|transitioning from one meaning to another]], perhaps inconsistent or even opposite, usage.&lt;ref&gt;Bryan A. Garner, ''Garner's Modern American Usage'', 2009, p. 306''f''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yagoda"/&gt; [[Linguistic purism|Purists]] may insist on the old usage, while [[Linguistic description|descriptivists]] may be more open to newer usages. Readers may not know which sense is meant.

The term was coined by [[Lexicography|lexicographer]] [[Bryan A. Garner]] in his 2008 edition of [[Garner's Modern American Usage]] and has since been adopted by some other [[style guide]]s.&lt;ref name="yagoda"&gt;Ben Yagoda, ''How to Not Write Bad: The Most Common Writing Problems and the Best Ways to Avoid Them'', {{ISBN|1594488487}}, 2013, p. 82 and ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
Garner recommends avoiding such terms if their use may distract from the meaning of a text.&lt;ref name="politics" /&gt;

Some terms, such as "[[wikt:fulsome|fulsome]]", may become skunked, and then eventually revert to their original meaning over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brenner|first1=Erin|title=The Story Behind "Fulsome"|url=http://www.vocabulary.com/articles/wc/the-story-behind-fulsome/|accessdate=6 September 2015|date=22 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

"[[wikt:decimate|Decimate]]" used to mean 'to kill one in ten' (from the [[decimation (Roman army)|Roman practice of decimation]]), but now means 'to destroy' or 'to kill nine out of ten.'

"[[Hopefully]]" used to mean 'in a hopeful manner' but has come to mean 'it is hoped' since the early 1960s.&lt;ref name="politics"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brenner|first1=Erin|title=The Politics of Writing: Should You Use Skunked Terms?|url=http://www.vocabulary.com/articles/wc/the-politics-of-writing-should-you-use-skunked-terms/|accessdate=6 September 2015|date=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Liberman|first1=Mark|title=The H-word|url=http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=3982|accessdate=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Beaujon|first1=Andrew|title=Hopefully, this is the last we'll write about 'hopefully'|url=http://www.poynter.org/news/mediawire/171092/hopefully-this-is-the-last-well-write-about-hopefully/|accessdate=6 September 2015|date=19 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples include "[[controversies about the word "niggardly"|niggardly]]", "[[Oriental]]", "[[data (word)|data]]", and "[[wikt:media|media]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Perlman|first1=Merrill|title=How common descriptors fall out of favor|url=http://www.cjr.org/language_corner/common_descriptors.php|accessdate=6 September 2015|date=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2013 [[Oxford English Dictionary]]'s definition of "[[wikt:literally|literally]]" to include "[[wikt:figuratively|figuratively]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hawkes|first1=Steve|title=Uproar as OED includes erroneous use of 'literally'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/10240917/Uproar-as-OED-includes-erroneous-use-of-literally.html|accessdate=6 September 2015|date=13 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, towards 2014, the conflation of '[[deep web]]' with '[[dark web]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Solomon|first1=Jane|title=The Deep Web vs. The Dark Web|url=http://blog.dictionary.com/dark-web/|accessdate=26 May 2015|date=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 'moot point' in British English has historically meant a point that is worth debating, but the meaning is shifting towards that in US English of a point that is irrelevant or academic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/mind-your-language/2015/jan/16/mind-your-language-moot-point|title=The meaning of ‘moot’ is a moot point – whichever variety of English you speak {{!}} Mind your language|last=Marsh|first=David|date=2015-01-16|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14831">'''Social media as a news source''' is the use on online [[social media]] platforms to obtain news. Just as television turned a nation of people who ''listened'' to media content into ''watchers'' of media content in the 1950s to the 1980s, the emergence of social media has created a nation of media [[Content creation|content creators]]. According to 2011 Pew Research data, nearly 80% of American adults are online and nearly 60% of them use social networking sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stateofthemedia.org/print-chapter/?print_id=5546 |title=Overview – » Print Chapter |date=14 March 2011 |work=stateofthemedia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; More Americans get their news via the Internet than from newspapers or radio, as well as three-fourths who say they get news from e-mail or social media sites updates, according to a report published by CNN. The survey suggests that [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] make news a more participatory experience than before as people share news articles and comment on other people's posts. According to CNN, in 2010 75% of people got their news forwarded through e-mail or social media posts, whereas 37% of people shared a news item via Facebook or Twitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/TECH/03/01/social.network.news/index.html |title=Survey: More Americans get news from Internet than newspapers or radio |work=cnn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, 81% of people say they look online for news of the weather, first and foremost. National news at 73%, 52% for sports news, and 41% for entertainment or celebrity news. Based on this study, done for the Pew Center, two-thirds of the sample's online news users were younger than 50, and 30% were younger than 30. The survey involved tracking daily the habits of 2,259 adults 18 or older.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/189776/one-third-of-adults-under-30-get-news-on-social-networks-now/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120928175253/http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/189776/one-third-of-adults-under-30-get-news-on-social-networks-now/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-09-28 |title=One-third of adults under 30 get news on social networks now |work=poynter.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty-three percent of young adults get news from social networks. Thirty-four percent watched TV news and 13% read print or digital content. Nineteen percent of Americans got news from [[Facebook]], [[Google+]], or [[LinkedIn]]. Thirty-six percent of those who get news from social network got it yesterday from survey. More than 36% of [[Twitter]] users use accounts to follow news organizations or journalists. Nineteen percent of users say they got information from news organizations of journalists. TV remains most popular source of news, but audience is aging (only 34% of young people).

Of those younger than 25, 29% said they got no news yesterday either digitally or traditional news platforms. Only 5% under 30 said they follow news about political figures and events in DC. Only 14% of respondents could answer all four questions about which party controls the House, current unemployment rate, what nation Angela Merkel leads, and which presidential candidate favors taxing higher-income Americans. Facebook and Twitter now pathways to news, but are not replacements for traditional ones. Seventy percent get social media news from friends and family on Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/189819/pew-tv-viewing-habit-grays-as-digital-news-consumption-tops-print-radio/ |title=Pew: Half of Americans get news digitally, topping newspapers, radio |work=poynter.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023061542/http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/189819/pew-tv-viewing-habit-grays-as-digital-news-consumption-tops-print-radio/ |archivedate=2013-10-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social media fosters communication. An Internet research company, Pew Research Center, claims that "more than half of internet users (52%) use two or more of the social media sites measured (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest) to communicate with their family or friends".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Frequency of Social Media Use |url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/01/09/frequency-of-social-media-use-2/ |website=Pew Research Center's Internet &amp; American Life Project|date=2015-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For children, using social media sites can help promote creativity, interaction, and learning. It can also help them with homework and class work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.mheducation.com/blog/thought-leadership/how-social-media-can-help-students-study.html |title=How Social Media Can Help Students Study |website=McGraw Hill Education |access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, social media enable them to stay connected with their peers, and help them to interact with each other. Some can get involved with developing fundraising campaigns and political events. However, it can impact social skills due to the absence of face-to-face contact.&lt;ref name="ChildrenScreens"&gt;{{cite news |title=Development of social skills in children hampered by digital media says study |url=http://www.losangelesnews.net/index.php/sid/225040619 |date=23 August 2014 |accessdate=23 August 2014 |publisher=''Los Angeles News.Net''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social media can affect mental health of teens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED525056 |title=Social Media &amp; Mobile Internet Use among Teens and Young Adults.

In a 2014 study, high school students ages 18 and younger were examined in an effort to find their preference for receiving news. Based on interviews with 61 teenagers, conducted from December 2007 to February 2011, most of the teen participants reported reading print newspapers only "sometimes," with fewer than 10% reading them daily. The teenagers instead reported learning about current events from social media sites such as Facebook, MySpace, YouTube, and blogs.&lt;ref name="Marchi"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0196859912458700 |title=With Facebook, Blogs, and Fake News, Teens Reject Journalistic 'Objectivity' |journal=Journal of Communication Inquiry |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=246–62 |year=2012 |last1=Marchi |first1=R. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study showed that social media users read a set of news that is different from what newspaper editors feature in the print press.&lt;ref name="Bastos"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/1461670X.2014.891857 |title=Shares, Pins, and Tweets |journal=Journalism Studies |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=305–25 |year=2014 |last1=Bastos |first1=Marco Toledo |url=http://openaccess.city.ac.uk/17081/1/SSRN-id2595698.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using nanotechnology as an example, a study was conducted that&lt;ref name="Runge et al. 2013"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11051-012-1381-8 |title=Tweeting nano: How public discourses about nanotechnology develop in social media environments |journal=Journal of Nanoparticle Research |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=1381 |year=2013 |last1=Runge |first1=Kristin K. |last2=Yeo |first2=Sara K. |last3=Cacciatore |first3=Michael |last4=Scheufele |first4=Dietram A. |last5=Brossard |first5=Dominique |last6=Xenos |first6=Michael |last7=Anderson |first7=Ashley |last8=Choi |first8=Doo-hun |last9=Kim |first9=Jiyoun |last10=Li |first10=Nan |last11=Liang |first11=Xuan |last12=Stubbings |first12=Maria |last13=Su |first13=Leona Yi-Fan |bibcode=2013JNR....15.1381R }}&lt;/ref&gt; studied tweets from [[Twitter]] and found that some 41% of the discourse about nanotechnology focused on its negative impacts, suggesting that a portion of the public may be concerned with how various forms of nanotechnology are used in the future. Although optimistic-sounding and neutral-sounding tweets were equally likely to express certainty or uncertainty, the pessimistic tweets were nearly twice as likely to appear certain of an outcome than uncertain. These results imply the possibility of a preconceived negative perception of many news articles associated with nanotechnology. Alternatively, these results could also imply that posts of a more pessimistic nature that are also written with an air of certainty are more likely to be shared or otherwise permeate groups on Twitter. Similar biases need to be considered when the utility of new media is addressed, as the potential for human opinion to over-emphasize any particular news story is greater despite the general improvement in addressed potential uncertainty and bias in news articles than in traditional media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gerhards |first1=Jürgen |last2=Schäfer |first2=Mike |year=2010 |title=Is the internet a better public sphere?

On October 2, 2013, the most common [[hashtag]] throughout the United States was "[[United States federal government shutdown of 2013|#governmentshutdown]]", as well as ones focusing on political parties, Obama, and healthcare. Most news sources have Twitter, and Facebook, pages, like CNN and the New York Times, providing links to their online articles, getting an increased readership. Additionally, several college news organizations and administrators have Twitter pages as a way to share news and connect to students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stateofthemedia.org/2012/mobile-devices-and-news-consumption-some-good-signs-for-journalism/what-facebook-and-twitter-mean-for-news/ |title=» What Facebook and Twitter Mean for News |date=18 March 2012 |work=stateofthemedia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to "Reuters Institute Digital News Report 2013",&lt;ref name=Reuters2013&gt;{{cite web |last1=Newman |first1=N. |last2=Levy |first2=D. |year=2013 |url=https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/fileadmin/documents/Publications/Working_Papers/Digital_News_Report_2013.pdf |format=PDF |title=Reuters Institute Digital News Report 2013 |website=reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207045914/https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/fileadmin/documents/Publications/Working_Papers/Digital_News_Report_2013.pdf |archivedate=2013-12-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the US, among those who use social media to find news, 47% of these people are under 45 years old, and 23% are above 45 years old. However social media as a main news gateway does not follow the same pattern across countries. For example, in this report, in Brazil, 60% of the respondents said social media was one of the five most important ways to find news online, 45% in Spain, 17% in the UK, 38% in Italy, 14% in France, 22% in Denmark, 30% in the U.S., and 12% in Japan.&lt;ref name=Reuters2013/&gt; Moreover, there are differences among countries about commenting on news in social networks, 38% of the respondents in Brazil said they commented on news in social network in a week. These percentages are 21% in the U.S. and 10% in the UK. The authors argued that differences among countries may be due to culture difference rather than different levels of access to technical tools.&lt;ref name=Reuters2013/&gt;

Rainie and Wellman have argued that media making now has become a participation work,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Networked: The New Social Operating System |author1=Rainie, Lee |author2=Wellman, Barry |lastauthoramp=yes |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bYJGna0AhdAC|isbn=9780262300407 |date=2012-04-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which changes communication systems. The center of power is shifted from only the media (as the gatekeeper) to the peripheral area, which may include government, organizations, and out to the edge, the individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jay-rosen/the-people-formerly-known_1_b_24113.html |work=Huffington Post |first=Jay |last=Rosen |title=The People Formerly Known as the Audience |date=30 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; These changes in communication systems raise empirical questions about trust to media effect. Prior empirical studies have shown that trust in information sources plays a major role in people's decision making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Renn |first=Ortwin |last2=Levine |first2=Debra |date=1990 |chapter=Credibility and trust in risk communication |editor1=Roger E.

In the Reuters report, 27% of respondents agree that they worry about the accuracy of a story on a blog.&lt;ref name=Reuters2013/&gt; However, 40% of them believe the stories on blogs are more balanced than traditional papers because they are provided with a range of opinions. Recent research has shown that in the new social media communication environment, the civil or uncivil nature of comments will bias people's information processing even if the message is from a trustworthy source,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brossard |first1=D. |date=Aug 2013 |title=New media landscapes and the science information consumer |journal=PNAS |volume=110 |issue=Suppl 3 |pages=14096–101 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1212744110 |pmc=3752175 |pmid=23940316 |bibcode=2013PNAS..11014096B }}&lt;/ref&gt; which bring the practical and ethical question about the responsibility of communicator in the social media environment.

'''''Ut pictura poesis''''' is a [[Latin]] phrase literally meaning "as is [[painting]] so is [[poetry]]". The statement (often repeated) occurs most famously in [[Horace]]'s ''[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]'', near the end, immediately after another famous quotation, "bonus dormitat Homerus", or "[[Homeric nod|even Homer nods]]" (an indication that even the most skilled poet can compose inferior verse):
:Poetry resembles painting. Some works will captivate you when you stand very close to them and others if you are at a greater distance. This one prefers a darker vantage point, that one wants to be seen in the light since it feels no terror before the penetrating judgment of the critic. This pleases only once, that will give pleasure even if we go back to it ten times over. (Quoting from English translation.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Companion to Horace|last=Golden|first=Leon|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2010|isbn=978-1-4051-5540-3|editor-last=Davis|editor-first=Gregson|location=Oxford, UK|pages=400|chapter=Reception of Horace's Ars Poetica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Horace meant that poetry (in its widest sense, "imaginative texts") merited the same careful interpretation that was, in Horace's day, reserved for painting.

Some centuries before [[Simonides of Ceos|Simonides of Keos]]( c. 556 – 468 BC) had stated, "Poema pictura loquens, pictura poema silens," which translates into, "Poetry is a speaking picture, painting a silent poetry."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/88/utpict.html.|title=Ut Pictura Poesis|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, as this phrase has traversed history, it has ignited academic arguments over whether or not it is true. [[Plato]], through his own thought process on credible knowledge, found painting and writing to be unreliable sources of understanding so disregarded the whole concept entirely. The lack of credibility rested on his opinion that both forms of art gave a false simulation of reality. Moving on from Plato's time to the Renaissance, the argument sprung up of which form was superior. It was decided, at this time, painting took precedence because sight was higher ranking to people than hearing was.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csmt.uchicago.edu/gloassary/2004/utpicturapoesis.htm|title=Ut Pictura Poesis|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]] opens his ''[[Laocoön|Laocoön: An Essay on the Limits of Painting and Poetry]]'' (1766){{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} by observing that "the first who compared painting with poetry &amp;#91;[[Simonides of Ceos]]&amp;#93; was a man of fine feeling,"&lt;ref&gt;Simonides, who wrote "poema pictura locguens, pictura poema silens" (poetry is a speaking picture, painting a silent [mute] poetry) was quoted by [[Plutarch]], ''De gloria Atheniensium'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0234%3Astephpage%3D346f 3.346f].&lt;/ref&gt; though, Lessing makes it clear, not a critic or philosopher. Lessing argues that painting is a synchronic, visual phenomenon, one of space that is immediately in its entirety understood and appreciated, while poetry (again, in its widest sense) is a diachronic art of the ear, one that depends on time to unfold itself for the reader's appreciation. He recommends that poetry and painting should not be confused, and that they are best practiced and appreciated "as two equitable and friendly neighbors."{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

[[W. J. T. Mitchell]] trenchantly observed that "We tend to think that to compare poetry with painting is to make a [[metaphor]], while to differentiate poetry from painting is to state a literal truth."&lt;ref&gt;Iconology: Image, Text, Ideology (University of Chicago Press, 1986) page 49&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alexander Pope ==
18th-century British poet [[Alexander Pope]] was partial to ''ut pictura poesis.'' He considered both painting and poetry to be equals, and "it can easily be seen that he held that there was a close relationship between the art of poetry and the art of painting, especially perhaps since such a relationship combined the two arts of which he was a practitioner."&lt;ref name="williams 61 75"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=Robert W.|date=1983-1984|title=Alexander Pope and Ut Pictura Poesis|url=https://openjournals.library.sydney.edu.au/index.php/SSE/article/view/396/365|journal=Sydney Studies in English|volume=9|pages=61–75|via=MLA International Bibliography}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is note of Pope finding himself "in a larger context of a continuous line of poetic pictorialism."&lt;ref name="williams 61 75"/&gt; ''Ut pictura poesis'' surfaces in regards to Pope's [[The Rape of the Lock|"Rape of the Lock"]] through his in-depth descriptions of the characters and plot. Rebecca Ferguson, in her essay "'Quick as her Eyes, and as unfix'd as those': objectification and seeing in Pope's "Rape of the Lock", draws attention to these details, specifically with Belinda’s character. Ferguson explains an aspect of how Pope was painting a character and a plot: "Pope's construction of Belinda seems to render her just such a 'frontier' between a constructive and a destructive chaos, between qualities which are 'neither inside nor outside', neither invested in her 'essential' self nor in her body," and

&lt;blockquote&gt;The belle is identified in many ways with the display of vessels and treasures around her, both as a consumer and as a figure who takes on some of the properties of those riches, yet her attractions are in the end not so much displayed as set in motion; she 'rises in her charms', 'awakens' and 'calls forth' her wonders and graces, culminating in the dispersal of both her body and her allure in the reader's eye. (Ferguson)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ferguson|first=Rebecca|date=1992|title=Quick as her Eyes, and as unfix’d as those’: objectification and seeing in  Pope’s "Rape of the Lock"|url=|journal=Critical Survey|volume=4|pages=14–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is an emphasis on the reader's eye and the imagery that contributed to audience members being able to so vividly 'watch' the plot of this poem unfold.

{{IPA vowels|class=infobox}} 
{{Manner_of_articulation}} 

A '''vowel''' is one of the two principal classes of speech sound, the other being a [[consonant]]. Vowels vary in quality, in loudness and also in [[Vowel length|quantity (length)]]. They are usually [[voice (phonetics)|voiced]], and are closely involved in [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] variation such as [[tone (linguistics)|tone]], [[intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] and [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]]. Vowel sounds are produced with an open [[vocal tract]]. 
The word ''vowel'' comes from the [[Latin]] word ''vocalis'', meaning "vocal" (i.e. relating to the voice).&lt;ref name="Vowel Etymology"&gt;{{cite web|title=Vowel|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=vowel|publisher=Online Etymology dictionary|accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In English, the word ''vowel'' is commonly used to refer both to vowel sounds and to the written symbols that represent them.

==Definition==
There are two complementary definitions of vowel, one [[Phonetics|phonetic]] and the other [[Phonology|phonological]].
*In the [[phonetic]] definition, a vowel is a sound, such as the [[English language|English]] "ah" {{IPAc-en|ɑː}} or "oh" {{IPAc-en|oʊ}}, produced with an open [[vocal tract]]; it is median (the air escapes along the middle of the tongue), oral (at least some of the airflow must escape through the mouth), [[frictionless]] and [[continuant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cruttenden|first1=Alan|title=Gimson's Pronunciation of English|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781444183092|page=27|edition=Eighth}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no significant build-up of air pressure at any point above the [[glottis]]. This contrasts with [[consonant]]s, such as the English "sh" {{IPA|[ʃ]}}, which have a constriction or closure at some point along the vocal tract. 
*In the phonological definition, a vowel is defined as [[Syllable|syllabic]], the sound that forms the [[syllable nucleus|peak of a syllable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cruttenden|first1=Alan|title=Gimson's Pronunciation of English|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781444183092|page=53|edition=Eighth}}&lt;/ref&gt; A phonetically equivalent but non-syllabic sound is a [[semivowel]]. In [[oral language]]s, phonetic vowels normally form the peak (nucleus) of many or all syllables, whereas [[consonant]]s form the [[syllable onset|onset]] and (in languages that have them) [[syllable coda|coda]]. Some languages allow other sounds to form the nucleus of a syllable, such as the [[syllabic consonant|syllabic]] (i.e., vocalic) ''l'' in the English word ''table'' {{IPA|[ˈtʰeɪ.bl̩]}} (when not considered to have a weak vowel sound: {{IPA|[ˈtʰeɪ.bəl]}}) or the syllabic ''r'' in the [[Serbo-Croatian]] word ''vrt'' {{IPA|[ʋr̩̂t]}} "garden".

The phonetic definition of "vowel" (i.e. a sound produced with no constriction in the vocal tract) does not always match the phonological definition (i.e. a sound that forms the peak of a syllable).&lt;ref&gt;Laver, John (1994) ''Principles of Phonetics'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[approximant]]s {{IPA|[j]}} and {{IPA|[w]}} illustrate this: both are  without much of a constriction in the vocal tract (so phonetically they seem to be vowel-like), but they occur at the onset of syllables (e.g. in "yet" and "wet") which suggests that phonologically they are consonants. A similar debate arises over whether a word like ''bird'' in a [[Rhotic consonant|rhotic]] dialect has an [[r-colored vowel]] {{IPA|/ɝ/}} or a syllabic consonant {{IPA|/ɹ̩/}}. The American linguist [[Kenneth Pike]] (1943) suggested the terms "'''vocoid'''" for a phonetic vowel and "vowel" for a phonological vowel,&lt;ref&gt;Crystal, David (2005) ''A Dictionary of Linguistics &amp; Phonetics (Fifth Edition)'', Maldern, MA/Oxford: Blackwell, p. 494.&lt;/ref&gt; so using this terminology, {{IPA|[j]}} and {{IPA|[w]}} are classified as vocoids but not vowels. However, Maddieson and Emmory (1985) demonstrated from a range of languages that semivowels are produced with a narrower constriction of the vocal tract than vowels, and so may be considered consonants on that basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{SOWL|323}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the phonetic and phonemic definitions would still conflict for the syllabic /l/ in ''table'', or the syllabic nasals in ''button'' and ''rhythm''.

[[File:Vowel quadrilateral (IPA 1949).png|thumb|The original vowel quadrilateral, from Jones' articulation. The vowel trapezoid of the modern IPA, and at the top of this article, is a simplified rendition of this diagram. The bullets are the cardinal vowel points. (A parallel diagram covers the front and central rounded and back unrounded vowels.) The cells indicate the ranges of articulation that could reasonably be transcribed with those cardinal vowel letters, {{IPA|[i, e, ɛ, a, ɑ, ɔ, o, u, ɨ]}}, and non-cardinal {{IPA|[ə]}}. If a language distinguishes fewer than these vowel qualities, {{IPA|[e, ɛ]}} could be merged to {{IPA|[e]}}, {{IPA|[o, ɔ]}} to {{IPA|[o]}}, {{IPA|[a, ɑ]}} to {{IPA|[a]}}, etc. If a language distinguishes more, {{IPA|[ɪ]}} could be added where the ranges of {{IPA|[i, e, ɨ, ə]}} intersect, {{IPA|[ʊ]}} where {{IPA|[u, o, ɨ, ə]}} intersect, and {{IPA|[ɐ]}} where {{IPA|[ɛ, ɔ, a, ɑ, ə]}} intersect.]]
The traditional view of vowel production, reflected for example in the terminology and presentation of the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], is one of [[Articulatory phonetics|articulatory features]] that determine a vowel's ''quality'' as distinguishing it from other vowels. [[Daniel Jones (phonetician)|Daniel Jones]] developed the [[cardinal vowel]] system to describe vowels in terms of the features of tongue ''height'' (vertical dimension), tongue ''backness'' (horizontal dimension) and ''roundedness'' (lip articulation). These three parameters are indicated in the schematic quadrilateral IPA [[vowel diagram]] on the right. There are additional features of vowel quality, such as the [[soft palate|velum]] position (nasality), type of [[vocal fold]] vibration (phonation), and tongue root position.

This conception of vowel articulation has been known to be inaccurate since 1928. Peter Ladefoged has said that "early phoneticians... thought they were describing the highest point of the tongue, but they were not. They were actually describing formant frequencies."&lt;ref&gt;Ladefoged &amp; Disner (2012) ''Vowels and Consonants'', 3rd ed., p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; (See below.) The IPA ''Handbook'' concedes that "the vowel quadrilateral must be regarded as an abstraction and not a direct mapping of tongue position."&lt;ref&gt;IPA (1999) ''Handbook of the IPA'', p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, the concept that vowel qualities are determined primarily by tongue position and lip rounding continues to be used in pedagogy, as it provides an intuitive explanation of how vowels are distinguished.

===Height===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Latin spelling and pronunciation]] --&gt;
Vowel height is named for the vertical position of the tongue relative to either the roof of the mouth or the aperture of the [[jaw]]. However, it actually refers to the first [[formant]] (lowest resonance of the voice), abbreviated F1, which is associated with the height of the tongue. In '''close vowels''', also known as '''high vowels''', such as {{IPA|[i]}} and {{IPA|[u]}}, the first formant is consistent with the tongue being positioned close to the palate, high in the mouth, whereas in '''open vowels''', also known as '''low vowels''', such as {{IPA|[a]}}, F1 is consistent with the jaw being open and the tongue being positioned low in the mouth. Height is defined by the inverse of the F1 value: The higher the frequency of the first formant, the lower (more open) the vowel.{{efn|According to [[Peter Ladefoged]], traditional articulatory descriptions such as height and backness "are not entirely satisfactory", and when phoneticians describe a vowel as high or low, they are in fact describing an acoustic quality rather than the actual position of the tongue.&lt;ref&gt;Ladefoged, Peter (2006) ''A Course in Phonetics (Fifth Edition)'', Boston, MA: Thomson Wadsworth, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] defines seven degrees of vowel height, but no language is known to distinguish all of them without distinguishing another attribute:

* [[close vowel|close]] (high)
* [[near-close vowel|near-close]] (near-high)
* [[close-mid vowel|close-mid]] (high-mid)
* [[mid vowel|mid]] (true-mid)
* [[open-mid vowel|open-mid]] (low-mid)
* [[near-open vowel|near-open]] (near-low)
* [[open vowel|open]] (low)

The letters {{IPA|[e, ø, ɵ, ɤ, o]}} are typically used for either close-mid or true-mid vowels. However, if more precision is required, true-mid vowels may be written with a lowering diacritic {{IPA|[e̞, ø̞, ɵ̞, ɤ̞, o̞]}}. The [[Kensiu language]], spoken in Malaysia and Thailand, is highly unusual in that it contrasts true-mid with close-mid and open-mid vowels, without any difference in other parameters like backness or roundness.

Although English contrasts six heights in its vowels, they are interdependent with differences in backness, and many are parts of [[diphthong]]s. It appears that some varieties of [[German language|German]] have five vowel heights that contrast independently of length or other parameters. The [[Austro-Bavarian|Bavarian]] dialect of [[Amstetten, Lower Austria|Amstetten]] has thirteen long vowels, which are reported to distinguish five heights (close, close-mid, mid, open-mid and open) each among the front unrounded, front rounded, and back rounded vowels as well as an open central vowel, for a total of five vowel heights: {{IPA|/i e ɛ̝ ɛ/, /y ø œ̝ œ/, /u o ɔ̝ ɔ/, /ä/}}. Otherwise, no language is known to contrast more than four degrees of vowel height.

The parameter of vowel height appears to be the primary cross-linguistic feature of vowels in that all [[spoken language]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s that have been researched till now use height as a contrastive feature. No other parameter, even backness or rounding (see below), is used in all languages. Some languages have [[vertical vowel system]]s in which at least at a phonemic level, only height is used to distinguish vowels.

=== Backness ===
[[File:Cardinal vowel tongue position-front.svg|thumb|upright=0.9|Idealistic tongue positions of [[Cardinal vowel|cardinal]] front vowels with highest point indicated.]]
Vowel backness is named for the position of the tongue during the articulation of a vowel relative to the back of the mouth. As with vowel height, however, it is ''defined'' by a formant of the voice, in this case the second, F2, not by the position of the tongue. In front vowels, such as {{IPA|[i]}}, the frequency of F2 is relatively high, which generally corresponds to a position of the tongue forward in the mouth, whereas in back vowels, such as {{IPA|[u]}}, F2 is low, consistent with the tongue being positioned towards the back of the mouth.

The [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] defines five degrees of vowel backness:
* [[front vowel|front]]
* [[near-front vowel|near-front]]
* [[central vowel|central]]
* [[near-back vowel|near-back]]
* [[back vowel|back]]



To them may be added front-central and back-central, corresponding to the vertical lines separating central from front and back vowel spaces in several IPA diagrams. However, ''front-central'' and ''back-central'' may also be used as terms synonymous with ''near-front'' and ''near-back''. No language is known to contrast more than three degrees of backness nor there is a language that contrasts front with near-front vowels nor back with near-back ones.

Although some English dialects have vowels at five degrees of backness, there is no known language that distinguishes five degrees of backness without additional differences in height or rounding.

===Front, raised and retracted===
[[File:Esling vowel chart.png|thumb|Front, raised and retracted are the three articulatory dimensions of vowel space]]
The conception of the tongue moving in two directions, high&amp;ndash;low and front&amp;ndash;back, is not supported by articulatory evidence and does not clarify how articulation affects vowel quality. Vowels may instead be characterized by the three directions of movement of the tongue from its neutral position: front, raised, and retracted. Front vowels ({{IPA|[i, e, ɛ]}} and, to a lesser extent {{IPA|[a, ɨ, ɘ, ɜ]}}, etc.), can be secondarily qualified as close or open, as in the traditional conception, but rather than there being a unitary category of back vowels, the regrouping posits [[raised vowel]]s, where the body of the tongue approaches the velum ({{IPA|[u, o, ɨ}}], etc.), and [[retracted vowel]]s, where the root of the tongue approaches the pharynx ({{IPA|[ɑ, ɔ]}}, etc.):
* [[Front vowel|front]]
* [[Raised vowel|raised]]
* [[Retracted vowel|retracted]]

Membership in these categories is scalar, with the mid-central vowels being marginal to any category.&lt;ref&gt;John Esling (2005) "There Are No Back Vowels: The Laryngeal Articulator Model", ''The Canadian Journal of Linguistics'' 50:&amp;nbsp;13–44&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Roundedness ===
{{Main article|Roundedness}}
[[Roundedness]] is named after the rounding of the lips in some vowels. Because lip rounding is easily visible, vowels may be commonly identified as rounded based on the articulation of the lips. Acoustically, rounded vowels are identified chiefly by a decrease in F2, although F1 is also slightly decreased.

In most languages, roundedness is a reinforcing feature of mid to high back vowels rather than a distinctive feature. Usually, the higher a back vowel, the more intense is the rounding. However, in some languages, roundedness is independent from backness, such as French and German (with front rounded vowels), most [[Uralic languages]] ([[Estonian language|Estonian]] has a rounding contrast for {{IPA|/o/}} and front vowels), [[Turkic languages]] (with a rounding distinction for front vowels and {{IPA|/u/}}), and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] with back unrounded vowels.

Nonetheless, even in those languages there is usually some phonetic correlation between rounding and backness: front rounded vowels tend to be more front-central than front, and back unrounded vowels tend to be more back-central than back. Thus, the placement of unrounded vowels to the left of rounded vowels on the IPA vowel chart is reflective of their position in formant space.

Different kinds of [[labialization]] are possible. In mid to high rounded back vowels the lips are generally protruded ("pursed") outward, a phenomenon known as ''exolabial rounding'' because the insides of the lips are visible, whereas in mid to high rounded front vowels the lips are generally "compressed" with the margins of the lips pulled in and drawn towards each other, a phenomenon known as ''endolabial rounding.'' However, not all languages follow that pattern. [[Japanese language|Japanese]] {{IPA|/u/}}, for example, is an endolabial (compressed) back vowel, and sounds quite different from an English exolabial {{IPA|/u/}}. [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] are the only two known languages in which the feature is contrastive; they have both endo- and exo-labial [[close front rounded vowel|close front vowels]] and [[close central rounded vowel|close central vowels]], respectively. In many phonetic treatments, both are considered types of rounding, but some phoneticians do not believe that these are subsets of a single phenomenon and posit instead three independent features of ''rounded'' (exolabial) and ''compressed'' (endolabial) and unrounded. The lip position of unrounded vowels may also be classified separately as ''spread'' and ''neutral'' (neither rounded nor spread).&lt;ref&gt;IPA (1999), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Others distinguish compressed rounded vowels, in which the corners of the mouth are drawn together, from compressed unrounded vowels, in which the lips are compressed but the corners remain apart as in spread vowels.

=== Nasalization ===
{{Main article|Nasal vowel|Nasalization}}
[[Nasalization]] refers to whether some of the air escapes through the nose. In [[nasal vowel]]s, the [[soft palate|velum]] is lowered, and some air travels through the nasal cavity as well as the mouth. An oral vowel is a vowel in which all air escapes through the mouth. [[French language|French]], [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] contrast nasal and oral vowels.

=== Phonation ===
{{Main article|Phonation}}
[[Phonation|Voicing]] describes whether the [[vocal cords]] are vibrating during the articulation of a vowel. Most languages have only voiced vowels, but several [[Native American languages]], such as [[Cheyenne language|Cheyenne]] and [[Totonac language|Totonac]], contrast voiced and devoiced vowels. Vowels are devoiced in whispered speech. In Japanese and in [[Quebec French]], vowels that are between voiceless consonants are often devoiced.

Modal voice, [[creaky voice]], and [[breathy voice]] (murmured vowels) are [[phonation]] types that are used contrastively in some languages. Often, they co-occur with [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] or stress distinctions; in the [[Mon language]], vowels pronounced in the high tone are also produced with creaky voice. In such cases, it can be unclear whether it is the tone, the voicing type, or the pairing of the two that is being used for [[phonemic contrast]]. The combination of phonetic cues (phonation, tone, stress) is known as ''register'' or ''register complex''.

=== Tongue root retraction ===
{{Main article|Advanced and retracted tongue root}}
Advanced tongue root (ATR) is a feature common across much of Africa, the [[Pacific Northwest]], and scattered other languages such as Modern [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]]. The contrast between advanced and retracted tongue root resembles the tense/lax contrast acoustically, but they are articulated differently. Those vowels involve noticeable tension in the vocal tract.

=== Secondary narrowings in the vocal tract ===
{{Main article|Pharyngealization}}
[[Pharyngealisation|Pharyngealized vowels]] occur in some languages like [[Sedang language|Sedang]] and the [[Tungusic languages]]. Pharyngealisation is similar in articulation to retracted tongue root but is [[acoustics|acoustically]] distinct.

A stronger degree of pharyngealisation occurs in the [[Northeast Caucasian languages]] and the [[Khoisan languages]]. They might be called '''epiglottalized''' since the primary constriction is at the tip of the epiglottis.

The greatest degree of pharyngealisation is found in the '''[[strident vowel]]s''' of the Khoisan languages, where the [[larynx]] is raised, and the pharynx constricted, so that either the epiglottis or the [[arytenoid cartilage]]s vibrate instead of the vocal cords.

Note that the terms ''pharyngealized'', ''epiglottalized'', ''strident'', and ''sphincteric'' are sometimes used interchangeably.

==== Rhotic vowels ====
{{Main article|R-colored vowel}}
[[R-colored vowel|Rhotic vowels]] are the "R-colored vowels" of American English and a few other languages.

=== Tenseness/checked vowels versus free vowels ===
{{Main article|Tenseness}}
[[Tenseness]] is used to describe the opposition of ''tense vowels'' as in ''leap'', ''suit'' vs. ''lax vowels'' as in ''lip'', ''soot''. This opposition has traditionally been thought to be a result of greater muscular tension, though phonetic experiments have repeatedly failed to show this.

Unlike the other features of vowel quality, tenseness is only applicable to the few languages that have this opposition (mainly [[Germanic language]]s, e.g. [[English language|English]]), whereas the vowels of the other languages (e.g. [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) cannot be described with respect to tenseness in any meaningful way. In discourse about the English language, "tense and lax" are often used interchangeably with "long and short", respectively, because the features are concomitant in the common varieties of English. This cannot be applied to all English dialects or other languages.

In most [[Germanic languages]], lax vowels can only occur in closed [[syllables]]. Therefore, they are also known as [[checked vowel]]s, whereas the tense vowels are called [[free vowel]]s since they can occur in any kind of syllable.

[[File:Spectrogram -iua-.png|thumb|upright=1.8|Spectrogram of vowels {{IPA|[i, u, ɑ]}}. {{IPA|[ɑ]}} is a low vowel, so its F1 value is higher than that of {{IPA|[i]}} and {{IPA|[u]}}, which are high vowels. {{IPA|[i]}} is a front vowel, so its F2 is substantially higher than that of {{IPA|[u]}} and {{IPA|[ɑ]}}, which are back vowels.]]

The scale is logarithmic. The grey range is where F2 would be less than F1, which by definition is impossible. {{IPA|[a]}} is an extra-low central vowel. Phonemically it may be front or back, depending on the language. Rounded vowels that are front in tongue position are front-central in formant space, while unrounded vowels that are back in articulation are back-central in formant space. Thus {{IPA|[y ɯ]}} have perhaps similar F1 and F2 values to the high central vowels {{IPA|[ɨ ʉ]}}; similarly {{IPA|[ø ɤ]}} vs central {{IPA|[ɘ ɵ]}} and {{IPA|[œ ʌ]}} vs central {{IPA|[ɜ ɞ]}}.

With {{IPA|[a]}} seen as an (extra-)low central vowel, the vowels {{IPA|[æ ɐ ɑ]}} can be redefined as front, central and back (near-)low vowels.
}}

The acoustics of vowels are fairly well understood. The different vowel qualities are realized in acoustic analyses of vowels by the relative values of the [[formant]]s, acoustic [[resonance]]s of the vocal tract which show up as dark bands on a [[spectrogram]]. The vocal tract acts as a [[resonant cavity]], and the position of the jaw, lips, and tongue affect the parameters of the resonant cavity, resulting in different formant values. The acoustics of vowels can be visualized using spectrograms, which display the acoustic energy at each frequency, and how this changes with time.

The first formant, abbreviated "F1", corresponds to vowel openness (vowel height). [[Open vowel]]s have high F1 frequencies, while [[close vowel]]s have low F1 frequencies, as can be seen in the accompanying spectrogram: The {{IPA|[i]}} and {{IPA|[u]}} have similar low first formants, whereas {{IPA|[ɑ]}} has a higher formant.

The second formant, F2, corresponds to vowel frontness. [[Back vowel]]s have low F2 frequencies, while [[front vowel]]s have high F2 frequencies. This is very clear in the spectrogram, where the front vowel {{IPA|[i]}} has a much higher F2 frequency than the other two vowels. However, in open vowels, the high F1 frequency forces a rise in the F2 frequency as well, so an alternative measure of frontness is the ''difference'' between the first and second formants. For this reason, some people prefer to plot as F1 vs. F2&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;F1. (This dimension is usually called 'backness' rather than 'frontness', but the term 'backness' can be counterintuitive when discussing formants.)

In the third edition of his textbook, [[Peter Ladefoged]] recommended using plots of F1 against F2&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;F1 to represent vowel quality.&lt;ref&gt;Ladefoged, Peter (1993) ''A Course in Phonetics (Third Edition)'', Fort Worth: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the fourth edition, he changed to adopt a simple plot of F1 against F2,&lt;ref&gt;Ladefoged, Peter (2001) ''A Course in Phonetics (Fourth Edition)'', Fort Worth: Harcourt, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; and this simple plot of F1 against F2 was maintained for the fifth (and final) edition of the book.&lt;ref&gt;Ladefoged, Peter (2006) ''A Course in Phonetics (Fifth Edition)'', Boston: Thomson Wadsworth, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; Katrina Hayward compares the two types of plots and concludes that plotting of F1 against F2&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;F1 "is not very satisfactory because of its effect on the placing of the central vowels",&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Katrina (2000) ''Experimental Phonetics'', Harlow, UK: Pearson, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; so she also recommends use of a simple plot of F1 against F2. In fact, this kind of plot of F1 against F2 has been used by analysts to show the quality of the vowels in a wide range of languages, including RP,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0025100300005417 | author = Deterding, David | year = 1997 | title = The formants of monophthong vowels in Standard Southern British English Pronunciation | url = | journal = Journal of the International Phonetic Association | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 47–55 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0025100305002124 | author = Hawkins, Sarah and Jonathan Midgley | year = 2005 | title = Formant frequencies of RP monophthongs in four age groups of speakers | url = | journal = Journal of the International Phonetic Association | volume = 35 | issue = 2| pages = 183–199 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Queen's English,&lt;ref&gt;Harrington, Jonathan, Sallyanne Palethorpe and Catherine Watson (2005) Deepening or lessening the divide between diphthongs: an analysis of the Queen's annual Christmas broadcasts.

[[R-colored vowel]]s are characterized by lowered F3 values.

Rounding is generally realized by a decrease of F2 that tends to reinforce vowel backness. One effect of this is that back vowels are most commonly rounded while front vowels are most commonly unrounded; another is that rounded vowels tend to plot to the right of unrounded vowels in vowel charts. That is, there is a reason for plotting vowel pairs the way they are.

== Prosody and intonation ==
{{Main article|Prosody (linguistics)|Intonation (linguistics)|Vowel length | l1=Prosody|l2=Intonation}}
In addition to variation in vowel quality as described above, vowels vary as a result of differences in [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]]. The most important prosodic variables are [[pitch (music) | pitch]] ([[fundamental frequency]]), [[loudness]] ([[sound_intensity |intensity]]) and [[vowel length | length]] ([[length (phonetics) |duration]])  However, the features of prosody are usually considered to apply not to the vowel itself, but to the [[syllable]] in which the vowel occurs. In other words, the ''domain'' of prosody is the syllable, not the segment (vowel or consonant). &lt;ref&gt;Lehiste, Ilse, ''Suprasegmentals'', M.I.T 1970, pp 42, 84, 147&lt;/ref&gt; We can list briefly the effect of prosody on the vowel component of a syllable. 

* Pitch: in the case of a syllable such as 'cat', the only [[Voicing (phonetics) | voiced]] portion of the syllable is the vowel, so the vowel carries the pitch information. This may relate to the syllable in which it occurs, or to a larger stretch of speech to which an intonation contour belongs. In a word such as 'man', all the segments in the syllable are [[sonorant]] and all will participate in any pitch variation. 

* Loudness: this variable has been traditionally associated with linguistic [[stress (linguistics) |stress]], though other factors are usually involved in this. Lehiste (ibid) argues that stress, or loudness, could not be associated with a single segment in a syllable independently of the rest of the syllable (p. 147). This means that vowel loudness is a concomitant of the loudness of the syllable in which it occurs.

* Length: it is important to distinguish two aspects of [[Vowel length |vowel length]]. One is the [[phonology | phonological]] difference in length exhibited by some languages. [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Latin]] have a two-way phonemic contrast between [[vowel length|short and long vowels]]. The [[Mixe language]] has a three-way contrast among short, half-long, and long vowels.&lt;ref&gt; Ladefoged, P. and Maddieson, I. ''The Sounds of the World's Languages'', Blackwell (1996), p 320 &lt;/ref&gt; The other type of length variation in vowels is non-distinctive, and is the result of prosodic variation in speech: vowels tend to be lengthened when in a stressed syllable, or when utterance rate is slow.

== Monophthongs, diphthongs, triphthongs ==
{{Main article|Monophthong|Diphthong|Triphthong|Semivowel}}
A vowel sound whose quality does not change over the duration of the vowel is called a [[monophthong]]. Monophthongs are sometimes called "pure" or "stable" vowels. A vowel sound that glides from one quality to another is called a [[diphthong]], and a vowel sound that glides successively through three qualities is a [[triphthong]].

All languages have monophthongs and many languages have diphthongs, but triphthongs or vowel sounds with even more target qualities are relatively rare cross-linguistically. English has all three types: the vowel sound in ''hit'' is a monophthong {{IPA|/ɪ/}}, the vowel sound in ''boy'' is in most dialects a diphthong {{IPA|/ɔɪ/}}, and the vowel sounds of ''flower'', {{IPA|/aʊər/}}, form a triphthong or disyllable, depending on dialect.

In [[phonology]], diphthongs and triphthongs are distinguished from sequences of monophthongs by whether the vowel sound may be analyzed into different [[phonemes]] or not. For example, the vowel sounds in a two-syllable pronunciation of the word ''flower'' ({{IPA|/ˈflaʊər/}}) phonetically form a disyllabic triphthong, but are phonologically a sequence of a diphthong (represented by the letters {{angle bracket|ow}}) and a monophthong (represented by the letters {{angle bracket|er}}). Some linguists use the terms ''diphthong'' and ''triphthong'' only in this phonemic sense.

== Written vowels ==
{{Main article|Writing system}}
The name "vowel" is often used for the symbols that represent vowel sounds in a language's [[writing system]], particularly if the language uses an [[alphabet]]. In writing systems based on the [[Latin alphabet]], the letters ''A'', ''E'', ''I'', ''O'', ''U'', ''Y'', ''W'' and sometimes others can all be used to represent vowels. However, not all of these letters represent vowels in all languages, or even consistently within one language (some of them, especially ''W'' and ''Y'', are also used to represent [[approximant consonant|approximants]]). Moreover, a vowel might be represented by a letter usually reserved for consonants, or a combination of letters, particularly where one letter represents several sounds at once, or vice versa; examples from English include ''igh'' in "thigh" and ''x'' in "x-ray". In addition, extensions of the Latin alphabet have such independent vowel letters as ''Ä'', ''Ö'', ''Ü'', ''Å'', ''Æ'', and ''Ø''.

The phonetic values vary considerably by language, and some languages use ''I'' and ''Y'' for the consonant {{IPA|[j]}}, e.g., initial ''I'' in [[Italian language|Italian]] or [[Romanian language|Romanian]] and initial ''Y'' in English. In the original Latin alphabet, there was no written distinction between ''V'' and ''U'', and the letter represented the approximant {{IPA|[w]}} and the vowels {{IPA|[u]}} and {{IPA|[ʊ]}}. In Modern [[Welsh language|Welsh]], the letter a''W'' represents these same sounds. Similarly, in [[Creek language|Creek]], the letter ''V'' stands for {{IPA|[ə]}}. There is not necessarily a direct one-to-one correspondence between the vowel sounds of a language and the vowel letters. Many languages that use a form of the Latin alphabet have more vowel sounds than can be represented by the standard set of five vowel letters. In English spelling, the five letters ''A'' ''E'' ''I'' ''O'' and ''U'' can represent a variety of vowel sounds, while the letter ''Y'' frequently represents vowels (as in e.g., "g'''y'''m", "happ'''y'''", or the diphthongs in "cr'''y'''", "th'''y'''me");&lt;ref&gt;In [[Wyvern|wyrm]] and [[myrrh]], there is neither a vowel letter nor, in rhotic dialects, a vowel sound.&lt;/ref&gt; ''W'' is used in representing some [[diphthong]]s (as in "co'''w'''") and to represent a [[monophthong]] in the borrowed words "{{linktext|cwm}}" and "{{linktext|crwth}}" (sometimes ''cruth'').

Other languages cope with the limitation in the number of Latin vowel letters in similar ways. Many languages make extensive use of combinations of letters to represent various sounds. Other languages use vowel letters with modifications, such as ''ä'' in [[Swedish language|Swedish]], or add [[diacritic]]al marks, like [[Umlaut (diacritic)|umlauts]], to vowels to represent the variety of possible vowel sounds. Some languages have also constructed additional vowel letters by modifying the standard Latin vowels in other ways, such as ''æ'' or ''ø'' that are found in some of the [[Scandinavian language]]s. The [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] has a set of 28 symbols to represent the range of basic vowel qualities, and a further set of diacritics to denote variations from the basic vowel.

The writing systems used for some languages, such as the [[Hebrew alphabet]] and the [[Arabic alphabet]], do not ordinarily mark all the vowels, since they are frequently unnecessary in identifying a word{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}. Technically, these are called [[abjad]]s rather than alphabets. Although it is possible to construct simple English sentences that can be understood without written vowels (&lt;span title="Can you read this?"&gt;''cn y rd ths?''&lt;/span&gt;), extended passages of English lacking written vowels can be difficult to understand; consider ''dd'', which could be any of ''dad, dada, dado, dead, deed, did, died, diode, dodo, dud, dude, odd, add'', or ''aided''. (But note that abjads generally express some word-internal vowels and all word-initial and word-final vowels, whereby the ambiguity will be much reduced.) The [[Masoretes]] devised a [[niqqud|vowel notation system]] for Hebrew [[Jewish scripture]] that is still widely used, as well as the [[trope (music)|trope]] symbols used for its [[cantillation]]; both are part of [[Oral Torahz|oral tradition]] and still the basis for many bible translations—Jewish and Christian.

===Shifts===
The differences in pronunciation of vowel letters between English and its related languages can be accounted for by the [[Great Vowel Shift]]. After printing was introduced to England, and therefore after spelling was more or less standardized, a series of dramatic changes in the pronunciation of the vowel phonemes did occur, and continued into recent centuries, but were not reflected in the spelling system. This has led to numerous inconsistencies in the spelling of English vowel sounds and the pronunciation of English vowel letters (and to the mispronunciation of foreign words and names by speakers of English).

The existence of vowel shifts should serve as a caution flag to anyone who is trying to pronounce an ancient language or, indeed, any poetry (in any language) from two centuries ago or earlier.

== Systems ==
The importance of vowels in distinguishing one word from another varies from language to language. Nearly all languages have at least three phonemic vowels, usually {{IPA|/i/, /a/, /u/}} as in [[Classical Arabic]] and [[Inuktitut language|Inuktitut]], though [[Adyghe language|Adyghe]] and many [[Sepik languages]] have a [[vertical vowel system]] of {{IPA|/ɨ/, /ə/, /a/}}. Very few languages have fewer, though some [[Arrernte language|Arrernte]], [[Northwest Caucasian languages|Circassian]], [[Ndu languages]] have been argued to have just two, {{IPA|/ə/}} and {{IPA|/a/}}, with {{IPA|[ɨ]}} being [[epenthetic]].

It is not straightforward to say which language has the most vowels, since that depends on how they are counted. For example, long vowels, nasal vowels, and various [[phonation]]s may or may not be counted separately; indeed, it may sometimes be unclear if phonation belongs to the vowels or the consonants of a language. If such things are ignored and only vowels with dedicated IPA letters ('vowel qualities') are considered, then very few languages have more than ten. The [[Germanic languages]] have some of the largest inventories: [[Danish phonology|Standard Danish]] has 11 to 13 short vowels ({{IPA|/(a) ɑ (ɐ) e ə ɛ i o ɔ u ø œ y/}}), while the [[Amstetten (district)|Amstetten]] dialect of [[Bavarian German|Bavarian]] has been reported to have thirteen long vowels: {{IPA|/iː yː eː øː ɛː œː æː ɶː aː ɒː ɔː oː uː/}}.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} The situation can be quite disparate within a same family language: [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[French language|French]] are two closely related [[Romance languages]] but Spanish has only five vowel qualities, {{IPA|/a, e, i, o, u/}}, while classical French has eleven: {{IPA|/a, ɑ, e, ɛ, i, o, ɔ, u, y, œ, ø/}}. The [[Mon–Khmer languages]] of Southeast Asia also have some large inventories, such as the eleven vowels of [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]: {{IPA|/i e ɛ ɐ a ə ɔ ɤ o ɯ u/}}. [[Wu Chinese|Wu]] dialects have the largest inventories of Chinese; the [[Jinhui dialect]] of Wu has also been reported to have eleven vowels: ten basic vowels, {{IPA|/i y e ø ɛ ɑ ɔ o u ɯ/}}, plus restricted {{IPA|/ɨ/}}; this does not count the seven nasal vowels.&lt;!--An earlier link had {{IPA|/i y e ø æ a ɑ ɯ u ɵ ɒ ɐ/}}, plus restricted {{IPA|/ɿ/}}, and allophones {{IPA|[ʌ ɛ ə ɤ ɪ ɔ o œ ʏ]}}, which differs from the current link.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://comonca.org.cn/lh/Doc/D13.pdf Values in open oral syllables] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/67l7GWs8G?url=http://comonca.org.cn/lh/Doc/D13.pdf |date=2012-05-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most common vowels is {{IPA|[a̠]}}; it is nearly universal for a language to have at least one open vowel, though most dialects of English have an {{IPA|[æ]}} and a {{IPA|[ɑ]}}—and often an {{IPA|[ɒ]}}, all open vowels—but no central {{IPA|[a]}}. Some [[Tagalog phonology|Tagalog]] and [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]] speakers have {{IPA|[ɐ]}} rather than {{IPA|[a]}}, and [[Yolŋu Matha|Dhangu Yolngu]] is described as having {{IPA|/ɪ ɐ ʊ/}}, without any peripheral vowels. {{IPA|[i]}} is also extremely common, though [[Tehuelche language|Tehuelche]] has just the vowels {{IPA|/e a o/}} with no close vowels. The third vowel of Arabic-type three-vowel system, {{IPA|/u/}}, is considerably less common. A large fraction of the languages of North America happen to have a four-vowel system without {{IPA|/u/}}: {{IPA|/i, e, a, o/}}; [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]] is an example.

In most languages, vowels serve mainly to distinguish separate [[lexeme]]s, rather than different inflectional forms of the same lexeme as they commonly do in the Semitic languages. For example, while English ''man'' becomes ''men'' in the plural, ''moon'' is not a different form of the same word.

===Words without vowels===
{{see also|English words without vowels}}

In rhotic dialects of English, as in Canada and the United States, there are many words such as ''bird, learn, girl, church, worst, [[Wurm (dragon)|wyrm]], [[myrrh]]'' that some phoneticians analyze as having no vowels, only a syllabic consonant {{IPA|/ɹ̩/}}. However, others analyze these words instead as having a [[rhotic vowel]], {{IPA|/ɝː/}}. The difference may be partially one of dialect.

There are a few such words that are disyllabic, like ''[[Wikt:cursor|cursor]], [[curtain]],'' and ''[[turtle]]:'' {{IPA|[ˈkɹ̩sɹ̩]}}, {{IPA|[ˈkɹ̩tn̩]}} and {{IPA|[ˈtɹ̩tl̩]}} (or {{IPA|[ˈkɝːsɚ]}}, {{IPA|[ˈkɝːtən]}}, and {{IPA|[ˈtɝːtəl]}}), and even a few that are trisyllabic, at least in some accents, such as ''purpler'' {{IPA|[ˈpɹ̩.pl̩.ɹ̩]}}, ''hurdler'' {{IPA|[ˈhɹ̩.dl̩.ɹ̩]}}, ''gurgler'' {{IPA|[ˈɡɹ̩.ɡl̩.ɹ̩]}}, and ''certainer'' {{IPA|[ˈsɹ̩.tn̩.ɹ̩]}}.

The word ''and'' frequently contracts to a simple [[nasal consonant|nasal]] ''’n,'' as in ''lock 'n key'' {{IPA|[ˌlɒk ŋ ˈkiː]}}. Words such as ''will, have,'' and ''is'' regularly contract to ''’ll'' {{IPA|[l]}}, ''’ve'' {{IPA|[v]}}, and '''s'' {{IPA|[z]}}. However, none of them are pronounced alone without vowels, so they are not phonological words. [[onomatopoeia|Onomatopoeic]] words that can be pronounced alone, and that have no vowels or ars, include ''hmm, pst!, shh!, [[Dental clicks|tsk]]!,'' and ''zzz''. As in other languages, onomatopoeiae stand outside the normal phonotactics of English.

There are other languages that form lexical words without vowel sounds. In [[Serbo-Croatian]], for example, the consonants {{IPA|[r]}} and {{IPA|[rː]}} (the difference is not written) can act as a [[syllable nucleus]] and carry rising or falling [[tone (linguistics)|tone]]; examples include the tongue-twister ''na vrh brda vrba mrda'' and geographic names such as ''[[Krk]]''. In [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]], either {{IPA|[l]}} or {{IPA|[r]}} can stand in for vowels: ''vlk'' {{IPA|[vl̩k]}} "wolf", ''krk'' {{IPA|[kr̩k]}} "neck". A particularly long word without vowels is ''čtvrthrst,'' meaning "quarter-handful", with two syllables (one for each R). Whole sentences can be made from such words, such as ''[[Strč prst skrz krk]],'' meaning "stick a finger through your neck" (follow the link for a sound file), and ''Smrž pln skvrn zvlhl z mlh'' "A morel full of spots wetted from fogs". (Here ''zvlhl'' has two syllables based on L; note that the [[preposition]] ''z'' consists of a single consonant. Only prepositions do this in Czech, and they normally link phonetically to the following noun, so do not really behave as vowelless words.) In Russian, there are also prepositions that consist of a single consonant letter, like ''k'' "to", ''v'' "in", and ''s'' "with". However, these forms are actually contractions of ''ko'', ''vo'', and ''so'' respectively, and these forms are still used in modern Russian before words with certain consonant clusters for ease of pronunciation.

In [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]] and certain other [[Turkic languages]], words without vowel sounds may occur due to reduction of weak vowels. A common example is the Kazakh word for one: ''bir'', pronounced {{IPA|[br]}}. Among careful speakers, however, the original vowel may be preserved, and the vowels are always preserved in the orthography.

In Southern [[varieties of Chinese]], such as [[Cantonese]] and [[Southern Min|Minnan]], some monosyllabic words are made of exclusively [[nasal consonant|nasal]]s, such as {{IPA|[m̩˨˩]}} "no" and {{IPA|[ŋ̩˩˧]}} "five".

So far, all of these syllabic consonants, at least in the [[lexical words]], have been [[sonorant]]s, such as {{IPA|[r]}}, {{IPA|[l]}}, {{IPA|[m]}}, and {{IPA|[n]}}, which have a [[voice (phonetics)|voiced]] quality similar to vowels. (They can carry tone, for example.) However, there are languages with lexical words that not only contain no vowels, but contain no sonorants at all, like (non-lexical) ''shh!'' in English. These include some [[Berber languages]] and some languages of the American [[Pacific Northwest]], such as [[Nuxalk language|Nuxalk]]. An example from the latter is ''scs'' "seal fat" (pronounced {{IPA-sal|sxs|}}, as spelled), and a longer one is ''clhp'xwlhtlhplhhskwts''' (pronounced {{IPA-sal|xɬpʼχʷɬtʰɬpʰɬːskʷʰt͡sʼ|}}) "he had had in his possession a bunchberry plant". (Follow the Nuxalk link for other examples.) Berber examples include {{IPA|/tkkststt/}} "you took it off" and {{IPA|/tfktstt/}} "you gave it". Some words may contain one or two consonants only: {{IPA|/ɡ/}} "be", {{IPA|/ks/}} "feed on".&lt;ref&gt;Audio recordings of selected words without vowels can be downloaded from {{cite web|url=http://ed268.univ-paris3.fr/lpp/pages/EQUIPE/ridouane/audio.doc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320021843/http://ed268.univ-paris3.fr/lpp/pages/EQUIPE/ridouane/audio.doc |archivedate=2009-03-20 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; (In [[Mandarin Chinese]], words and syllables such as ''sī'' and ''zhī'' are sometimes described as being syllabic fricatives and affricates phonemically, {{IPA|/ś/}} and {{IPA|/tʂ́/}}, but these do have a voiced segment that carries the tone.) In the [[Japonic language]] [[Miyako language|Miyako]], there are words with no voiced sounds, such as ''ss'' 'dust', ''kss'' 'breast/milk', ''pss'' 'day', ''ff'' 'a comb', ''kff'' 'to make', ''fks'' 'to build', ''ksks'' 'month', ''sks'' 'to cut', ''psks'' 'to pull'.

===Words consisting of only vowels===
It is not uncommon for short grammatical words to consist of only vowels, such as ''a'' and ''I'' in English. Lexical words are somewhat rarer in English and are generally restricted to a single syllable: ''eye, awe, owe'', and in non-rhotic accents ''air, ore, err''. Vowel-only words of more than one syllable are generally foreign loans, such as ''ai'' (two syllables: {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɑː|i}}) for the [[maned sloth]], or proper names, such as ''[[Iowa]]'' (in some accents: {{IPAc-en|ˈ|aɪ|.|oʊ|.|ə}}).

However, vowel sequences in [[hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]] are more freely allowed in some other languages, most famously perhaps in [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] and [[Polynesian languages|Polynesian]] languages, but also in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Finnic languages]]. In such languages there tends to be a larger variety of vowel-only words. In [[Swahili language|Swahili]] (Bantu), for example, there is ''[[wikt:aua|aua]]'' 'to survey' and ''[[wikt:eua|eua]]'' 'to purify' (both three syllables); in Japanese, ''[[wikt:aoi|aoi]]'' 青い 'blue/green' and ''oioi'' 追々 'gradually' (three and four syllables); and in Finnish, ''aie'' 'intention' and ''auo'' 'open!' (both two syllables), although some dialects pronounce them as ''aije'' and ''auvo''. [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]], and the Polynesian languages generally, have unusually large numbers of such words, such as ''aeāea'' (a small green fish), which is three syllables: ''ae.āe.a''. Most long words involve [[reduplication]], which is quite productive in Polynesian: ''ioio'' 'grooves', ''eaea'' 'breath', ''uaua'' 'tough' (all four syllables), ''auēuē'' 'crying' (five syllables, from ''uē (uwē)'' 'to weep'), ''uoa'' or ''uouoa'' 'false mullet' (sp. fish, three or five syllables). The longest continuous vowel sequence is in Finnish word ''hääyöaie'' ("wedding night intention").

'''Wearable art''', also known as ''Artwear'' or "art to wear", refers to individually designed pieces of (usually) handmade clothing or [[jewellery]] created as fine or expressive art. While the making of any article of clothing or other wearable object typically involves aesthetic considerations, the term ''wearable art'' implies that the work is intended to be accepted as a serious and unique artistic creation or statement. Pieces may be sold and/or exhibited. The modern idea of wearable art seems to have surfaced more than once in various forms. Marbeth Schon's book on modernist jewellery (see the section on jewellery below) refers to a "wearable art movement" spanning roughly the years 1930 to 1960. A 2003 ''[[The New York Times]]'' review of a book on knitting refers to "the 60s Art to Wear movement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Penelope Green |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F02E3DD143CF937A35756C0A9659C8B63&amp;&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=%22art%20to%20wear%20movement%22&amp;st=cse |title=BOOKS OF STYLE; Why Knit? The Answers |publisher=New York Times |date=2003-05-04 |accessdate=2014-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Beo Beyond Costume design.jpg|thumb|220px|Wearable art by the artist Beo Beyond]]

Most wearable art is made of fibrous materials and constitutes therefore a branch of the wider field of [[fiber art]], which includes both wearable and non-wearable forms of art using fabric and other fiber products. Wearable art as an artistic domain can also include jewelry, or clothing made from non-fiber materials such as leather, plastic sheeting, metals, etc.

==Wearable fiber art==
Artists creating wearable fiber art may use purchased finished fabrics or other materials, making them into unique garments, or may dye and paint virgin fabric. Countering the belief that art is something expensive, some clothing artists have started local companies to produce quality art work and clothing for a modest price. Wearable art is not restricted to jewellery but is also seen in graphic [[T-shirt]]s and even pants.

As with any other art form, the talent and skills of artists in this field vary widely. Since the nature of the medium requires [[craft]] skills as well as artistic skills, an advanced artist may wish to study [[color theory]], [[chemistry]], [[sewing]], [[Fashion designer|clothing design]], and computer software such as [[Photoshop]] and [[Illustrator]]. Classes in [[fashion design|clothing design and marketing]] are offered at colleges such as the [[Fashion Institute of Technology]] in [[New York City]].

The [[New Zealand]] city of [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]] gained a reputation in the field of wearable art, with its ''World of Wearable Art Awards'', held annually since 1987 and run by [[Suzie Moncrieff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Suzie Moncrieff has the WoW factor|url = http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/capital-life/8884275/Suzie-Moncrieff-has-the-WoW-factor|newspaper = [[Stuff.co.nz]]|date = 2013-07-06|access-date = 2015-12-02|language = English|first = Kimberley|last = Rothwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the show moved to [[Wellington]] to a larger venue, although [[World of Wearable Art|a museum of garments]] remains in Nelson. In Australia, the [[Shearwater Wearable Arts]] or W.A.V.E. (Wearable Arts Vision In Education) has developed from a high school initiative to become a leading wearable arts event.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} It is held at [[Shearwater, The Mullumbimby Steiner School]] in [[Mullumbimby]], New South Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.shearwaterperformingarts.com/ | title=Shearwater Wearable Arts 2017 | publisher=Shearwater The Mullumbimby Steiner School | work=Shearwater Wearable Arts | accessdate=November 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jewelry as wearable art==
{{main|Art jewelry}}
Some 20th-century modern artists and architects sought to elevate bodily ornamentation — that is, jewellery — to the level of fine art and original design, rather than mere decoration, craft production of traditional designs, or conventional settings for showing off expensive stones or precious metals. In ''Modernist Jewelry 1930-1960: The Wearable Art Movement'' (2004), author Marbeth Schon explores unique and innovative wearable art objects created by surrealists, cubists, abstract expressionists, and other modernist artists working in the middle decades of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schon |first=Marbeth |url=http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=modernist+%22The+Wearable+Art+Movement+%22&amp;qt=owc_search |title=Results for 'modernist "The Wearable Art Movement "' |publisher=Worldcat.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extreme examples==
Not all garments created as wearable art are made from traditional fibers or fabrics, and not all such artworks are meant for ordinary, practical use. [[Performance art|Performance]] and [[conceptual art]]ists have sometimes produced examples which are more provocative than useful.  [[Trashion]] is another branch of extraordinary wearable art, for example, work by [[Marina DeBris]].  The Portland Oregon Trashion Collective, Junk to Funk, has been using creating outrageous art garments out of trash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.junktofunk.org |title=Junk to Funk |publisher=Junk to Funk |date=2012-09-10 |accessdate=2014-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A well-known example is the ''Electric Dress'', a [[Shinto wedding|ceremonial wedding]] [[kimono]]-like costume consisting mostly of variously colored electrified and painted light bulbs, enmeshed in a tangle of wires, created in 1956 by the Japanese [[Gutai]] artist [[Atsuko Tanaka (artist)|Atsuko Tanaka]]. This extreme garment was something like a stage costume. Not really wearable in an everyday, practical  sense, it functioned rather as part of a daring work of [[performance art]] (though the "performance" element consisted merely of the artist's wearing the piece while mingling with spectators in a gallery setting).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stevens |first=Mark |url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/arts/art/reviews/9937/ |title=Electrifying Art: Atsuko Tanaka, 1954-1968 - New York Magazine Art Review |publisher=Nymag.com |date=2004-10-04 |accessdate=2014-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Nam June Paik]]'s 1969 performance piece called ''TV Bra for Living Sculpture'', [[Charlotte Moorman]] played a [[cello]] while wearing a [[brassiere]] made of two small operating television sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Glenn Collins |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE2D7143DF93AA35752C1A967958260 |title=Charlotte Moorman, 58, Is Dead; A Cellist in Avant-Garde Works |publisher=New York Times |date= |accessdate=2014-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian artist Andrea Vander Kooij created a group of pieces called ''Garments for Forced Intimacy'' (2006). According to an essay at [[Concordia University (Montreal)|Concordia University]]'s Faculty of Fine Arts gallery website, these hand-knit articles of clothing are designed to be worn by two people simultaneously, and they, "as the name states, compel the wearers into uncharacteristic proximity."&lt;ref&gt;[http://fofagallery.concordia.ca/ehtml/2007/acting.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080204221546/http://fofagallery.concordia.ca/ehtml/2007/acting.htm |date=February 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[wearable computing]] technology develops, increasingly miniaturized and stylized equipment is starting to blend with wearable art esthetics.  Low-power mobile computing allows light-emitting and color-changing flexible materials  and high-tech fabrics to be used in complex and subtle ways.  Some practitioners of the [[Steampunk]] movement have produced elaborate costumes and accessories which incorporate a pseudo-Victorian style with modern technology and materials.
