The '''2006 Prague terror plot''' was revealed on September 23, 2006, when security services in [[Prague]] went on high alert due to suspicions of an imminent terror attack.

==The plot==
According to the [[Czech Republic]]'s leading newspaper, ''[[Mlada fronta Dnes]]'', [[Islamist]] extremists were planning to kidnap and kill [[Jews]] in Prague. They intended to take Jews captive in a Prague [[synagogue]], make demands which could not be met and then blow up the building, killing everybody inside. Interior Minister [[Ivan Langer]] said the situation was "the most serious ever".&lt;ref name="SP"&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,441131,00.html Plot Against Jews Reported in Prague], ''[[Der Spiegel|Spiegel]]'', October 06, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Czech [[Chief Rabbi]] [[Karol Sidon|Efraim Sidon]], the attack had been planned against the [[Jubilee Synagogue|Jerusalem Synagogue]] in the center of the city, and not against a synagogue in the [[Josefov (Prague)|Jewish Quarter]].&lt;ref name = "Haaretz"&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/771427.html Czech officials: Synagogue plot may be linked to Oslo attacks], ''[[Haaretz]]'', October 8th, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The Czech security services were investigating  a possible link between fresh terror threats made by radical Muslims to kill Jews in Prague and the arrest of a Pakistani citizen in Oslo.&lt;ref name = "Haaretz" /&gt;

No information has been released and it is unknown if any arrests had been made. {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

The '''coat of arms of [[Kiev]]''' features the [[Archangel Michael]], wielding a flaming [[sword]] and a shield on an [[azure (heraldry)|azure]] field.

==History==
The coat of arms traces its history back to the medieval principality of [[Kievan Rus']], where the Archangel Michael was depicted on the seals used by the Kievan [[grand prince]]s. Initially the coat of arms of Kiev featured [[Saint George]] fighting a dragon on an azure field, and this today remains the coat of arms of the [[Kiev Oblast]]. In the 16th century, a coat consisting of the Archangel Michael clad in white robes, holding a sword and a [[shield]] on a red field was adopted for the [[Kiev Voivodeship]]. &lt;!--picture needed--&gt;

In 1487, along with [[Magdeburg rights]], the city of [[Kiev]] received a coat of arms consisting of a hand holding a [[crossbow]].

In 1782, a new coat of arms was approved by the order of [[Catherine II of Russia]]. In the order the coat of arms &lt;!---of the region---&gt; is described as "Archangel Michael in a short tunic on an azure field". Later on it was decorated with an imperial crown and other ornaments. No original image of the arms has been recovered to date. Some modern drawings of the arms exist, based on the description in Catherine's order.

In 1918, during the short time of Ukrainian independence, a coat of arms was adopted which contained, in addition to the Archangel Michael and the crossbow, a [[trident]] from the [[Coat of arms of Ukraine]], emphasizing the city's role as the nation's capital.

In 1957, a coat of arms was introduced with [[chestnut]] leaves and a bow on the red-azure field, containing the word КИЇВ (''KYIV''; Ukrainian for 'KIEV'), and such Soviet symbols as the [[hammer and sickle]] and the [[Hero City]] medal. Since 1973 the [[Aesculus hippocastanum|horse-chestnut]] leave became one of the symbols of the city.

In May 1995, the [[Kiev City Council]] restored the city's original coat of arms depicting the Archangel Michael.

'''Costa Rica–Russia relations''' ({{lang-ru|Российско-костариканские отношения}}) are the bilateral relationships between the countries [[Costa Rica]] and [[Russia]]. Each of the two countries has an [[embassy]] in the other's capital city, [[Moscow]] and [[San José, Costa Rica|San José]].

==Background==
The [[Soviet Union]] established [[diplomatic relations]] with Costa Rica on May 8, 1944.

==Present==
Both countries are members of the [[United Nations]], and since 2008, holders of a [[Russian passport]] need a [[Visa (document)|visa]] to visit Costa Rica. With a [[Visa (document)#Types|tourist visa]], Russians can stay in Costa Rica for a maximum of 30 days. In order to get a tourist visa, the person needs to apply for it in the closest Costa Rican embassy to where the person is living. He/she must have a [[Passport|valid passport]] and either have an [[invitation letter]] or a [[bank statement]] with enough [[money]].

Holders of a [[Costa rican passport|Costa Rican passport]] also need a visa to Russia.

'''Deneb Karentz''' is full-time faculty, professor, and chair of the Biology Department at [[University of San Francisco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usfca.edu/faculty/deneb-karentz|title=Deneb Karentz|last=|date=2015-07-06|website=University of San Francisco|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her research focuses the [[ultraviolet]] [[photobiology]] of marine organisms and understanding their strategies for protection from UV exposure, particularly in relation to the ecological implications of [[Antarctic]] ozone depletion.

== Early Life and education ==
Karentz grew up in Millis, MA, the daughter of Rose and Varoujan Karentz, and turned to athletics in high school as a two-sport captain to complement a proud academic standing. Karentz earned her BS at the [[University of Rhode Island]] in 1973, MS at [[Oregon State University]] in 1976 and PhD at the University of Rhode Island in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://advance.uri.edu/quadangles/sept2007/story10.htm|title=Class Acts Profiles|website=advance.uri.edu|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her graduate research focused on the physiology and ecology of marine [[phytoplankton]]. She has lived in San Francisco, California since 1983. She held an NIH National Service Award Fellowship for post-doctoral research at the Laboratory of Radiobiology and Environmental Health, University of California San Francisco from 1983-1986. She worked in the lab of [http://cancer.ucsf.edu/people/profiles/cleaver_james.3557 James E. Cleaver], conducting research on the molecular genetics of an inherited human disease, xeroderma pigmentosum (XP). Patients afflicted with XP are extremely sensitive to sunlight and are unable to repair UV-induced damage to DNA. Karentz remained at UCSF as a research biologist until hired as a professor of Biology and Environmental Science at the University of San Francisco in 1992.

== Career and impact ==
Karentz became involved in Antarctic research in 1986 as a volunteer on a field team studying the photophysiology of springtime phytoplankton in McMurdo Sound. Karentz's research focuses on the ultraviolet [[photobiology]] of marine organisms: identifying strategies for protection from UV exposure and understanding mechanisms for repair of UV–induced damage. Her work has focused on investigating the ecological implications of Antarctic [[ozone depletion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1989/11/06/will-ozone-depletion-disrupt-antarcticas-ecosystem/f56ad9ea-93b3-488b-a041-08efa7ea7f98/|title=Will Ozone Depletion Disrupt Antarctica's Ecosystem?|last=Booth|first=William|date=6 November 1989|work=The Washington Post|access-date=19 May 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1990/07/31/ozone-hole-may-harm-marine-life/999972b2-4c8b-41d7-af11-8bf7aedde626/|title=Ozone Hole May Harm Marine Life|last=Booth|first=William|date=31 July 1990|work=The Washington Post|access-date=19 May 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1993/04/15/in-the-debate-about-ozone-no-depletion-in-rhetoric/124a6433-3c77-4cc7-9d7f-28571876bcf3/|title=In the Debate About Ozone, No Depletion in Rhetoric|last=|first=|date=15 April 1993|work=The Washington Post|access-date=19 May 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the past 30 years, she has made the trip to Antarctica over 20 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://armenianweekly.com/2015/10/12/living-with-the-penguins-in-antarctica/|title=Living with the Penguins in Antarctica|last=Hairenik|date=2015-10-12|website=Armenian Weekly|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of her research has focused on the effects of ozone depletion on marine [[plankton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/07/science/broad-effort-under-way-to-track-ozone-hole-s-effects.html?pagewanted=all|title=Broad Effort Under Way to Track Ozone Hole's Effects|last=Browne|first=Malcolm W.|date=7 January 1992|work=The New York Times|access-date=19 May 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1986 - 2016 her research has been conducted at [[Palmer Station|Palmer]] and [[McMurdo Station]]s, and aboard several research cruises in the [[Bellingshausen Sea]] and the [[Ross Sea]]. Since 1994 she has also been an instructor for the NSF advanced international integrative biology course taught at [[McMurdo Station]] and Palmer Station for early career scientists from across the world. She served for two years as the associate program manager for the Biology and Medicine Program at the U.S. [[National Science Foundation]] Office of Polar Programs. She has served as a U.S. representative to the Group on Life Sciences for the [[Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research]], and is currently the second US delegate to SCAR. She is also (since 2011) a private sector advisor for the US delegation to the Committee on Environmental Protection under the Antarctic Treaty System.

== Awards and honors ==
An Antarctic ice-covered lake, Lake Karentz, was named after her in 2005 by the [[United States Board on Geographic Names|U.S. Board of Geographic Names]] in recognition of her contribution to the study of Antarctica.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://geonames.usgs.gov/apex/f?p=136:3:0::NO::P3_ANTAR_ID,P3_TITLE:18744,Lake%2520Karentz|title=GNIS Detail - Lake Karentz|website=geonames.usgs.gov|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jamestownpress.com/news/2007-04-26/news/015.html|title=Antarctic lake named for scientist and former Jamestown resident|date=2007-04-26|website=www.jamestownpress.com|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mapcarta.com/25605794|title=Karentz, Lake|last=|first=|date=|website=Mapcarta|publisher=|access-date=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1992 she was awarded the Luigi Provasoli Award for Outstanding Paper in the Journal of Phycology (1991-1992) from the Phycological Society of America for

It  thus became the first ever military operation of the EU.

EUFOR Concordia was a significant event in the evolution of the EU's security cooperation. In the words of the then EU High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, Javier Solana, when the Common European Foreign and Security Policy started only about a decade before, in 1992, "[f]ew then believed that... we would send out men in arms under the EU's flag."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/articles/78480.pdf|title = A joint effort for peace and stability|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Solana|first = Javier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 December 2003 the EUFOR Concordia was replaced by an EU Police Mission, code-named EUPOL PROXIMA, and the 400 EU soldiers were replaced by 200 EU police officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = European Union - EEAS (European External Action Service) {{!}} EUPOL PROXIMA/FYROM|url = http://www.eeas.europa.eu/csdp/missions-and-operations/proxima-fyrom/index_en.htm|website = www.eeas.europa.eu|accessdate = 2015-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = EU's first military mission ends|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3321637.stm|newspaper = BBC|date = 2003-12-15|access-date = 2015-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''General Directorate of Taxation''' ({{sq|Drejtoria e Përgjithshme e Tatimeve}}) is a  revenue collection agency of the [[Albanian Government]]. 

Its mission is to collect tax revenues through simple and minimal cost procedures, uniformly applying tax legislation to finance the Albanian state budget.
To achieve these goals, the Directorate assists taxpayers with high quality services so they can fulfill their own tax obligations under the applicable legislation.

The administration is tasked to monitor, evaluate and penalize any conduct by the taxpayer who does not enforce or deliberately misappropriate the fulfillment of their legal obligations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tatime.gov.al/c/8/42/68/rreth-administrates-tatimore-qendrore Rreth Administratës Tatimore Qendrore]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2456">The '''Geneva Revolution of 1782''' was a short-lived attempt to broaden the franchise and include men of modest means in the republican government of the [[city state]].

In 1782 the constitution of the small city-state of Geneva limited the franchise to 1,500 well-to-do male burghers, (upper middle class citizens, mostly merchants.)  About 5,000 lower middle-class ''natives,''  male Genevans born to long-standing Geneva families, lived in the city but were excluded from voting or serving in office.  These men worked as artisans and craftsmen in various trades, principally watchmakers.  Also excluded from the franchise were an even larger number of ''habitants,'' residents whose roots lay in the canton but outside the city, or whose families had immigrated to Geneva from elsewhere.&lt;ref name=Polasky17&gt;{{cite book|last1=[[Janet Polasky]]|title=[[Revolutions without Borders]]|date=2015|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|isbn=978-0-300-20894-8|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Agitation for a broader franchise had been ongoing for years; on 5 February 1781, unenfranchised men, ''habitants,'' and ''natives,'' broke into the municipal armory and armed themselves.  In response, the General Council of Geneva, the largest of the city's legislative bodies, voted to grant voting rights to 100 ''natives'' and 20 ''habitants.''   However, the more elite legislative body, the Genevan Small Council, baulked at ratifying this token offer of enfranchisement, stalling for over a year before, in April 1782, voting to block the enfranchisement.&lt;ref name=Polasky18&gt;{{cite book|last1=[[Janet Polasky]]|title=[[Revolutions without Borders]]|date=2015|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|isbn=978-0-300-20894-8|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Within hours of the vote, revolutionists occupied the City Hall, closed the city gates, held the "no voters (called ''Negatives'') hostage, and convinced the Representatives of the General Council to support them.&lt;ref name=Polasky18/&gt;

The city's wealthy burghers countered by persuading the [[Kingdom of France]], the city-state of [[Bern]], and the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] to send professional troops. The leaders of the aborted Revolution fled by ship across Lake Geneva.  The city was returned to government by the burgher elite.&lt;ref name=Polasky18/&gt;

The '''Grévy's Zebra Trust''' '''GZT''' was founded in 2007 for the protection of the [[Grévy's Zebra]]s (''Equus grevyi'') and their [[habitat]]. The Conservancy works to engage and incorporate local communities in protecting [[Grévy's Zebra]] in [[Ethiopia]] and [[Kenya]]. GZT uses scouts to collect scientific data, provide security, surveillance, and run education programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Programs==

===Grevy's Zebra Scouts===
Grevy's Zebra scouts are locals who are hired and trained to help monitor the herds and report back data. The scouts also help share the message of conservation in their own communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url = http://wildlifeconservationnetwork.org/wildlife/zebra2.html#conservationist
 |title = Grévy's Zebra Trust
 |publisher = [[Wildlife Conservation Network]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Holistic Rangeland Management===
Grévy's Zebra Trust works with communities to [[Rangeland management|manage grazing]] cattle to improve the land by tilling the land and fertilizing the land so that native grasses that the Zebras eat are better able to grow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |publisher = www.treehugger.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grévy's Zebra Ambassadors===
Individuals from the Samburu and Turkana tribes that sometimes have conflict over resources are brought together to work with solutions to poaching and given jobs in data collection, security, surveillance and spreading the conservation message.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url = http://ewasolions.wildlifedirect.org/2012/05/07/warriors-training/
 |title = Training Warriors with Grevy’s Zebra Trust
 |publisher = Wildlife Direct}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education and Outreach===
Teams of scouts go into the communities to perform conservation storytelling and puppet shows for local children and through workshops for the adults. In this process they strive to learn the needs of the communities.

The '''International Cotton Advisory Committee''' ('''ICAC''') is an association of governments of [[cotton]] producing, consuming and trading countries which acts as the international commodity body for cotton and cotton textiles. 
==Structure and history==
Founded at the International Cotton Meeting in [[Washington, DC]] in 1939, the ICAC advocates for cotton producing nations, publishes studies and technical information on the cotton industry, and holds an annual Plenary Meeting of member states. While most of the world's cotton producing nations are members, two of the ten largest producers (The [[People's Republic of China]] and [[Turkmenistan]]) are not members of the ICAC.  All of the top five cotton exporting nations are members.

The International Cotton Advisory Committee (ICAC) along with private sector cotton organizations initiated the International Forum for Cotton Promotion (IFCP) in 2000. The IFCP serves as a forum and clearinghouse for the exchange of proven cotton promotion techniques. The IFCP facilitates domestically focused and domestically funded cotton promotion programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=A.|first=A.A.

'''Johannes Guillaume Christianus Andreas "Jan" Marijnissen''' ({{Audio|Nl-Jan Marijnissen.ogg|Jan Marijnissen}}) (born 8 October 1952) is a retired [[Netherlands|Dutch]] politician of the [[Socialist Party (Netherlands)|Socialist Party]] (SP).

Marijnissen a [[welder]] by occupation, was selected as [[Leader of the Socialist Party (Netherlands)|Leader of the Socialist Party]] after the death of [[Daan Monjé]] on 1 October 1986 and became [[Socialist Party (Netherlands)#Leadership|Chairman of the Socialist Party]] on 20 May 1988. For the [[Dutch general election, 1994|election of 1994]] Marijnissen was the [[Lijsttrekker]] (top candidate) and won two seats in the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]], the first time the [[Socialist Party (Netherlands)|Socialist Party]] won representation in the [[States General of the Netherlands]]. Marijnissen was elected as a [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|Member of the House of Representatives]] on 17 May 1994 and became the [[Parliamentary leader]] of the [[Socialist Party (Netherlands)|Socialist Party]] in the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]]. For the [[Dutch general election, 1998|elections of 1998]] and [[Dutch general election, 2002|2002]] Marijnissen again as [[Lijsttrekker]] won three and four seats respectively. For the [[Dutch general election, 2006|election of 2006]] Marijnissen for the fifth time as [[Lijsttrekker]] won sixteen seats and the [[Socialist Party (Netherlands)|Socialist Party]] became the third-largest party [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]]. On 20 June 2008 Marijnissen announced his retirement as [[Leader of the Socialist Party (Netherlands)|Leader of the Socialist Party]] and [[Parliamentary leader]] of the [[Socialist Party (Netherlands)|Socialist Party]] in the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]] citing health reasons. Marijnissen remained a [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|Member of the House of Representatives]] until after the [[Dutch general election, 2010|2010 general election]]. Marijnissen stood down as [[Socialist Party (Netherlands)#Leadership|Chairman of the Socialist Party]] on 28 November 2015.

He is the father of [[Lilian Marijnissen]], the current [[Leader of the Socialist Party (Netherlands)|Leader of the Socialist Party]].  

==Early life==
Johannes Guillaume Christianus Andreas Marijnissen was born on 8 October 1952 in [[Oss]] in the [[Provinces of the Netherlands|Dutch Province]] of [[North Brabant]] in a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] family. After leaving secondary school shortly before the exams, he worked in a number of factories in and around [[Oss]]. He then trained as a welder, working for ten years in the metal industry.

==Politics==
===Local politics===
Meanwhile, he helped founding the SP in Oss and, in 1975, became the Netherlands' youngest councillor ever. He remained a councillor until 1993, playing a leading role in many campaigns, such as against polluting discharges. The SP's council representation in Oss has grown at every local election and is, as of 2005, the biggest stronghold of the Socialist Party in the Netherlands. Nicknamed "The Wizard of Oss", after his hometown, he became famous when he turned out to be one of the main architects of the Dutch vote that rejected the [[European Constitution]] in June 2005.

In 1987 Marijnissen became the party's first ever [[States-Provincial|provincial]] assembly member, in [[North Brabant]]. A year later he became the SP's national president. Under his leadership the party was transformed from "a federation of local branches" into a party with a clear national programme, nationally-organised activities and a national profile.

===National politics===
Beginning in 1994, when the SP made the breakthrough which brought it into the [[House of Representatives of the Netherlands|House of Representatives]], Marijnissen was chairman of the party's parliamentary group. After gaining two out of the 150 parliamentary seats during this first breakthrough, support for him and his party rose slowly but continuously. After four years in parliament, his Socialist Party went under his lead from two to five seats during the [[Dutch general election, 1998|national elections of 1998]], which was followed by a growth towards nine seats in 2002.

In 2003, after the 87-day term of [[First Balkenende cabinet|Balkenende I]], the Socialist Party didn't manage to gain more seats than the year before and stayed at the same level with again 9 out of 150 seats. Although there was a slight rise in number of people who voted for the SP compared to a year before, a few weeks before the elections the polls suggested the SP might double.

After the 2004 elections a conflict arose between Jan Marijnissen and [[Ali Lazrak]], when the latter refused to conform to an agreement that required all SP politicians to donate part of their wages. Lazrak accused Marijnissen of dictatorial behavior; an attempt to settle the argument failed and Lazrak left the [[fraction (politics)|fraction]] on 2 February 2004.

In February 2006 the party was polled on 9.5% of the electorate in the [[Dutch municipal elections, 2006|municipal elections]]. After the untimely end of [[Second Balkenende cabinet|Balkenende II]] and the minority government of [[Third Balkenende cabinet|Balkenende III]], the SP won 16 more seats in the [[Dutch general election, 2006|2006 elections]] to a total of 25, becoming the third party of the Netherlands. Soon after, the party membership passed 50,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.janmarijnissen.nl/2006/11/29/50000-2/ Jan Marijnissen verwelkomt 50.000ste SP-lid met taart en bloemen]. Downloaded November 29, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 a majority of members of parliament voted for his idea to build a National Historic Museum in the Netherlands. In 2007 the Minister of Culture decided the city [[Arnhem]] would be its residence.

On 17 June 2008 Marijnissen announced his resignation as chairman of the SP group in the House of Representatives because of health reasons.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trouw.nl/hetnieuws/nederland/article1015335.ece/Marijnissen_vertrekt_als_SP-fractievoorzitter|title=Cookies op Trouw.nl|work=trouw.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he remains a member of the House of Representatives and chairman of the Socialist Party.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Marijnissen was said to appeal to the 'common man' because of his use of simple language. His appeal is also explained by some observers by his capacity of presenting himself as a valid, more social alternative to the [[Dutch Labour Party|PvdA]], which moved into a more centrist [[Third Way (centrism)|third way]] direction by advocating welfare reforms under the leadership of Prime Minister [[Wim Kok]] and his so-called Purple Cabinets (1994–2002).

Critics of Marijnissen call his leadership style authoritarian, because he is presumed to have a tight grip on his party.

'''Jelgava Gymnasium''' or '''Academia Petrina''' is the oldest higher educational establishment in [[Latvia]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LYJpobnjoc0C&amp;pg=PA89 Education, the Baltic States and the EU by Bryan T. Peck, page 89]&lt;/ref&gt; Based on an idea by [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Raison]], it was established in [[Jelgava|Mitau]], capital of the [[Duchy of Courland and Semigallia]], by Duke [[Peter von Biron]] in 1775. The duke wanted to attract professors like [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Johan Gottfried Herder]], but they refused.

After the [[partitions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], Jelgava became part of the [[Russian Empire]] and the gymnasium unsuccessfully petitioned to become a university.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=yjIkV9vLWZIC&amp;pg=PA52 Estonian studies in the history and philosophy of science by R. A. Vikhalemm, page 52]&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, it became an important cultural hub not only for Latvians, but also [[Lithuania]]ns.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=MhxpVYgJ_rIC&amp;pg=PA98 Lithuanian social democracy in perspective, 1893-1914by Leonas Sabaliūnas, page 98]&lt;/ref&gt; Many famous professors had lectured in Academia Petrina for example [[Johann Benjamin Koppe]] (1775), [[Johann August von Starck]] (1777-1781) and [[Wilhelm Gottlieb Friedrich Beitler]] (1775-1811).

During World War I, the school was evacuated to [[Taganrog]] in [[Rostov Oblast]] while its 42,000-volume library was burned by troops of [[Pavel Bermondt-Avalov]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Zoq_TtEN54IC&amp;pg=PA395 International dictionary of library histories, Volume 1 By David H. Stam, page 395]&lt;/ref&gt; During World War II, the historical school building was almost completely destroyed, therefore school was reestablished in new premises. The original building was later restored and now functions as the [[Ģederts Eliass]] Jelgava History and Art Museum.

== History==
The establishment of the academy was based on an idea by [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Raison]]: ''"But the whole province owes him excellent thanks for the effective part, which he took at the foundation of the Mitauian Gymnasium. He was actually the one who persuaded Duke Peter to do so; it was he who corresponded with Sulzern regarding the plan to be drawn up and because of the appointment of the first teachers and he who prescribed the books for the library and the instruments for the observatory; just as he also continuously participated in the perfection of the institute until his death".'' &lt;ref&gt;[[Allgemeines Schriftsteller- und Gelehrten-Lexikon der Provinzen Livland, Esthland und Kurland]], bearbeitet von [[Johann Friedrich von Recke]], [[Karl Eduard Napiersky]], Dritter Band, L-R, Mitau 1831, S. 461–463 [http://personen.digitale-sammlungen.de/baltlex/Blatt_bsb00000342,00465.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The intention was to establish a complete [[university]] with all four faculties in Mitau. This plan was rejected because of Kurland's dependence on Catholic-Polish rule. Under the law of [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]] a university could not be founded without the consent and confirmation of the Pope, and it was unclear whether and when the permission by the papal curia to establish a Protestant theological faculty could have been obtained. Therefore, this intention was abandoned and it was decided to found an [[academic gymnasium]] which -&amp;nbsp;half school, half university&amp;nbsp;- should enjoy all the rights of a university, with the exception of the privilege of granting academic dignity. &lt;ref&gt;http://docplayer.org/44610177-Sitzungsberichte-jahresberichte-1935-1936-der-kurzemer-kurlaendischen-gesellschaft-fuer-literatur-und-kunst.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="968">'''Kaskazi''' is a name used to refer to an ancient ethno-linguistic group of [[Bantu peoples]] which took shape in the [[East African Rift|Western Rift]] area in the early centuries of the last millennium BC within the [[Mashariki people|Mashariki group]].  The name comes from the [[swahili language|swahili]] word for "northern wind", in opposition to the [[Kusi people|Kusi]] subgroup ("southern wind").  The Kaskazi subgroup settled north of [[Mozambique]] and [[Malawi]], while the Kusi settled in the south.&lt;ref&gt;Ehret (1998), p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;  Both the Kaskazi and Kusi did not form as single communities with a single language, but as clusters of communities speaking a variety of slightly different languages.&lt;ref&gt;Ehret (1998), p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1602 Ricci map is a very large, {{convert|5|ft|abbr=on|2}} high and {{convert|12|ft|abbr=on|2}} wide, [[woodcut]] using a [[Map projection#Pseudocylindrical|pseudocylindrical map projection]] showing [[China]] at the center of the known world.&lt;ref name="Abbe"/&gt; The 1906 Eckert IV map resembles the display of this Chinese map. It is the first map in Chinese to show the [[Americas]]. The map's [[mirror image]] originally was carved on six large blocks of wood and then [[Woodblock printing|printed]] in brownish ink on six mulberry paper panels, similar to the making of a [[folding screen]].

It portrays both [[North America|North]] and [[South America]] and the [[Pacific Ocean]] with reasonable accuracy. China appropriately is linked to [[Asia]], [[India]], and the [[Middle East]]. [[Europe]], the [[Mediterranean]], and [[Africa]] also are well delineated.&lt;ref name="Abbe"/&gt; Diane Neimann, a trustee of the James Ford Bell Trust, notes that: "There is some distortion, but what's on the map is the result of commerce, trade and exploration, so one has a good sense of what was known then."&lt;ref name="Abbe"/&gt;

Ti Bin Zhang, first secretary for cultural affairs at the Chinese Embassy in [[Washington, D.C.]], said in 2009: "The map represents the momentous first meeting of East and West" and was the "catalyst for commerce."&lt;ref name="CBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/artdesign/story/2010/01/12/rare-map-china-world.html|title=Rare map puts China at centre of world|date=12 January 2010|work=CBC News|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Centre|accessdate=12 January 2010|location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The map includes images and annotations describing different regions of the world. Africa is noted to have the world's highest mountain and longest river. The brief description of North America mentions "humped oxen" or [[bison]] (駝峰牛 ''tuófēngníu''), [[feral horse]]s (野馬, ''yěmǎ''), and names [[Canada]] (加拿大, ''Jiānádà''). The map identifies [[Florida]] as ''Huādì'' (花地), the "Land of Flowers." Several Central and South American places are named, including [[Guatemala]] (哇的麻剌, ''Wādemálá''), [[Yucatan]] (宇革堂, ''Yǔgétáng''), and [[Chile]] (智里, ''Zhīlǐ'').&lt;ref name="CBC"/&gt;

The map's [[cartographer]], Matteo Ricci, gave a brief description of the discovery of the Americas. "In olden days, nobody had ever known that there were such places as North and South America or [[Magellanica]] (using [[Terra Australis|a name]] that early mapmakers gave to a supposed continent including Australia, Antarctica, and [[Tierra del Fuego]]), but a hundred years ago, Europeans came sailing in their ships to parts of the sea coast, and so discovered them."&lt;ref name="CBC"/&gt;

The Museo della Specola [[Bologna]] has in its collection, displayed on the wall of the Globe Room, original copies of panels 1 and 6 of the six panels comprising the 1602 Ricci map. During restoration and mounting, a central panel—a part of the Doppio Emisfero delle Stelle by the German mathematician and astronomer [[Johann Adam Schall von Bell]]—was inserted between the two sections by mistake.

In 1958, Pasquale D’Elia, sinologist at the [[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome]]  certified the authenticity of the Chinese maps in this museum’s possession, (see op. cit.) stating that "it is the third edition of a geographical and cartographical work that made Ricci famous throughout China. He had already made a first edition in 1584 at Shiuhing, followed by a second in 1600 at [[Nanking]], and two years later a third in Peking.&lt;ref name="Battistini"/&gt;

In 1938, an exhaustive work by Pasquale d'Elia, edited by the Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana, was published with comments, notes, and translation of the whole map.&lt;ref name="d'Elia"&gt;{{cite book|last=d' Elia|first= Pasquale M.|title= Il mappamondo cinese del P Matteo Ricci, S.I.

D’Elia’s translation reads:

{{quotation|"Once I thought learning was a multifold experience and I would not refuse to travel [even] ten thousand Li to be able to question wise men and visit celebrated countries. But how long is a man’s life? It is certain that many years are needed to acquire a complete science, based on a vast number of observations: and that’s where one becomes old without the time to make use of this science. Is this not a painful thing?
And this is why I put great store by [geographical] maps and history: history for fixing [these observations], and maps for handing them on [to future generations].

Respectfully written by the European Matteo Ricci on 17 August 1602."}}

The figure of the ''Nove Cieli'' (Nine Skies) is printed to the left of the title, illustrated as per sixteenth-century conceptions. The accompanying inscription explains the movement of the planets.  The right-hand section (panel 6) has other inscriptions giving general ideas on geography and oceanography. Another inscription records an extract of the Storia dei Mongoli regarding the motions of the Sun.
In the top of the left-hand section (panel 1), there is an explanation of eclipses and the method for measuring the Earth and the Moon. Both sections carry the characteristic Jesuit seal, the [[Holy Name of Jesus|IHS]] of the [[Society of Jesus]]. At the bottom left, in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], is the name of the Chinese [[publisher]] of the map and the date: ''one day of the first month of autumn in the year 1602''.&lt;ref name="Battistini"/&gt;

The map also incorporates an explanation of parallels and meridians, a proof that the sun is larger than the moon, a table showing the distances of planets from the earth, an explanation of the varying lengths of days and nights, and polar projections of the earth that are unusually consistent with its main map.&lt;ref name="Rothstein"/&gt;

==History==
[[Matteo Ricci]] (1552–1610) was a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] priest. Ricci was one of the first Western scholars to live in China and he became a master of Chinese script and the Classical Chinese language. In 1583, Ricci was among the first Jesuits to enter China from Macao. The first Chinese world map was named ''Yudi Shanhai Quantu'' (輿地山海全圖) and made in [[Zhaoqing]] in 1584 by Matteo Ricci with Chinese collaborators.&lt;ref name="Elman"/&gt;  Ricci had a small Italian wall map in his possession and created Chinese versions of it at the request of the governor of Zhaoqing at the time, Wang Pan, who wanted the document to serve as a resource for explorers and scholars.&lt;ref name="regents"/&gt;

On January 24, 1601, Ricci was the first Jesuit - and one of the first Westerners -  to enter the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] capital [[Beijing]],&lt;ref name="Battistini"/&gt; bringing atlases of Europe and the West that were unknown to his hosts. The Chinese had maps of the East that were equally unfamiliar to Western scholars.

In 1602, at the request of the [[Wanli Emperor]], Ricci collaborated with Mandarin Zhong Wentao, a technical translator,  [[Li Zhizao#Li Zhizao|Li Zhizao]],&lt;ref name="Elman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Elman|first=Benjamin A. |title=On their own terms: science in China, 1550–1900|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA|date=April 2005|pages=127-Matteo Mundi's ''Mappa Mundi''|chapter=Sin0-Jesuit Accommodations During the Seventeenth Century|isbn=978-0-674-01685-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KPEpPhlzPg0C&amp;pg=PA127#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other Chinese scholars in Beijing to create what was his third and largest world map, the ''Kunyu Wanguo Quantu''.&lt;ref name="regents"/&gt;

In this map, European geographic knowledge, new to the Chinese, was combined with Chinese information unknown to Europeans to create the first map known to combine Chinese and European cartography.&lt;ref name="regents"/&gt; Among other things, this map revealed the existence of America to the Chinese. Ford W. Bell said: "This was a great collaboration between East and West. It really is a very clear example of how trade was a driving force behind the spread of civilization."

According to John D. Day,&lt;ref name="Day"&gt;John D. Day, “The Search for the Origins of the Chinese Manuscripts of Matteo Ricci’s Maps”, ''Imago Mundi'' 47 (1995), pp. 94–117&lt;/ref&gt; Matteo Ricci prepared four editions of Chinese world maps during his [[Jesuit China missions#Ricci.27s policy of accommodation|mission in China]] before 1603:
# a 1584 early woodblock print made in Zhaoqing, called ''Yudi Shanhai Quantu''; 
# a 1596 map carved on a [[stele]], called ''Shanhai Yudi Tu'' (山海輿地圖);
# a 1600 revised version of the 1596, usually named ''Shanhai Yudi Quantu'' (山海輿地全圖), engraved by Wu Zhongming; 
# a 1602 larger and much refined edition of the 1584 map, in six panels, printed in Beijing, called ''Kunyu Wanguo Quantu'';&lt;ref name="Day"/&gt;{{#tag:ref|Hong Weilian, earlier established a list of twelve total Ricci maps, which differs from Day’s findings.}}&lt;ref name="Kao"&gt;“Kao Li Madou de shijie ditu”, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ptak"/&gt;

Several prints of the Kunyu Wanguo Quantu were made in 1602. Most of the original maps now are lost. Only six original copies of the map are known to exist, and only two are in good condition. Known copies are in the [[Vatican Library|Vatican]] Apostolic Library Collection I and at the [[James Ford Bell Library]] at the University of Minnesota. The Vatican's 1602 copy was reproduced by Pasquale d’Elia in the beautifully arranged book, ''Il mappamondo cinese del P Matteo Ricci, S.I.'' in 1938. This modern work also contains Italian translations of the [[Colophon (publishing)|colophon]]s on the map, a catalogue of all [[toponym]]s, plus detailed notes regarding their identification.&lt;ref name="Day"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mappa"&gt;''Mappamondo''. For earlier English translations of some of the colophons, see, for example, Lionel Giles, “Translations from the Chinese World Map of Father Ricci”, ''Geographical Journal'' 52 (1918), pp. 367–385; and 53 (1919), pp. 19–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other copies of the 1602 map are located at: Japan, [[Kyoto University]] Collection; collection of Japan [[Miyagi Prefecture]] Library; Collection of the Library of the [[Japanese Cabinet]]; and a private collection in Paris, France.&lt;ref name="Abbe"/&gt;&lt;ref name="regents"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bell.lib.umn.edu/RicciMap1.html|title=The James Ford Bell Library to Unveil Ricci Map on January 12|year=2009|work=James Ford Bell Library|publisher=Regents of the University of Minnesota|accessdate=13 January 2010|location=Minneapolis}}&lt;/ref&gt; No original examples of the map are known to exist in China, where Ricci was revered and buried.&lt;ref name="CBC"/&gt;

The maps received widespread attention and circulation. The governor General of Guizhou reproduced a copy of the map in a book about Guizhou published in Guiyang in 1604. Ricci estimated that more than 1,000 copies of the 1602 edition were reprinted.&lt;ref name="Hostetler"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hostetler|first=Laura|title=Qing Colonial Enterprise: Ethnography and Cartography in Early Modern China |publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|year=2001|pages=52–54|chapter=Two- Mapping Territory|isbn=978-0-226-35420-0 |oclc=61477717|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8UKTzo1UiVgC&amp;pg=PA52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various versions of the map were exported to [[Korea]] and later [[Japan]]. The first Korean copy was brought back from Beijing by visiting ambassadors in 1603.&lt;ref name=park/&gt; An unattributed and very detailed two page coloured edition of the map, known in Japanese as ''Konyo Bankoku Zenzu'', was made in Japan circa 1604. Within this Japanese export copy, Japanese [[Katakana]] is utilised for foreign location names throughout the Western world. 

The ''Gonyeomangukjeondo'' ([[Hangul]]: 곤여만국전도) is a [[Korea]]n hand-copied reproduction print by Painter [[Kim Jin-yeo]] in 1708, the 34th year of [[Sukjong of Joseon|King Sukjong's]] rule of [[Joseon]]. It shows Kunyu Wanguo Quantu (Complete Map of the World) measuring 533×170&amp;nbsp;cm on mulberry paper. This map, representing the world in an ellipse, was brought to Korea in the 36th year of King Seonjo's rule (1710) by Lee Gwan-jeong and Gwon Hui, two envoys of Joseon to China. It is owned and displayed at [[Seoul National University]] Museum, San 56-1, Sillim-dong, Gwanak-gu, [[Seoul]], Korea and was designated National Treasure No.849 on August 9, 1985. The map shows five world continents and over 850 toponyms. It contains descriptions of ethnic groups and main products associated with each region. In the margins outside the ellipse, there are images of the northern and southern hemispheres, the [[Aristotel]]ian [[geocentric]] world system, and the orbits of the sun and moon. It has an introduction by Choe Seok-jeong providing information on the constitution of the map and its production process. This reproduction map provides a clear testimony to the national interest in western maps in 17th-century Korea. It is a highly esthetic piece of work and one of the most beautiful maps produced during the Joseon period.&lt;ref name="Seoul"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sca.seoul.go.kr/english/culturalAsset.jsp?sClssCode=2&amp;sClssCode2=10|title=Gonyeomangukjeondo (Kunyu Wanguo Quantu; Complete Map of the World)|work=Cultural History of Seoul|publisher=Seoul Metropolitan Government|accessdate=15 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bell Library copy==
The [[James Ford Bell Trust]] announced in December 2009 that it had acquired one of two good copies of the 1602 Ricci map from the firm of [[Bernard J. Shapero]], a noted dealer of rare books and maps in London, for US$1&amp;nbsp;million, the second most expensive map purchase in history. This copy had been held for years by a private collector in Japan.&lt;ref name="CBC"/&gt;

Ford W. Bell, president of the American Association of Museums (now the [[American Alliance of Museums]]) and a trustee of the James Ford Bell Trust started by his grandfather, [[James Ford Bell]], the founder of [[General Mills]], said in an interview with a reporter from [[Minnesota Public Radio]]'s ''[[All Things Considered]]'': "These opportunities don't present themselves very often. This map was the only one on the market, and the only one likely to be on the market. So we had to take advantage of that opportunity."&lt;ref name="Baran"/&gt;

The map was displayed for the first time in North America at the [[Library of Congress]] from January through April, 2010. It was [[Image scanner|scanned]] by the Library of Congress Geography and Map Division to create a permanent [[digital image]] that will be posted on the [[internet]] later in 2010 in the [[World Digital Library]] for scholars and students to study. The map was then exhibited briefly at the [[Minneapolis Institute of Arts]], before moving to its permanent home at the [[James Ford Bell Library]] at the [[University of Minnesota]], where it will be on display beginning September 15, 2010.&lt;ref name="Baran"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Urschel"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2010/10-002.html|title=Rare 1602 World Map, the First Map in Chinese to Show the Americas, on Display at Library of Congress, Jan. 12 to April 10|last=Urschel|first=Donna|date=12 January 2010|work=News from the Library of Congress|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=12 January 2010|location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chinese maps published after 1602==
Before his death at Peking in 1610, Matteo Ricci prepared four more world maps after the 1602 one:
:5. a 1603 eight panel version of the 1602 map, usually named ''Liangyi Xuanlan Tu'' (兩儀玄覽圖) (Map for the far-reaching observation of heaven and earth). The 1603 edition is larger than the 1602, but is less well known because of the fewer extant copies and versions based on it;&lt;ref name="Chen"/&gt;
:6. a 1604 booklet based on the map of 1600, also named ''Shanhai Yudi Quantu''; engraved by Guo Zizhang (郭子章);	
:7. a new 1608 version, twelve copies presented to the emperor
:8. and a 1609 map in two hemispheres.&lt;ref name="Day"/&gt;

Most of these maps now are lost. Later copies of the 1602 edition of the ''Kunyu Wanguo Quantu'' may be found in China, Korea, London, and Vienna;&lt;ref&gt;A reproduction of the Vienna map can be found in Österreichisch Nationalbibliothek (1995).''Kartographische Zimelien. Die 50 schönsten Karten und Globen der Österreichischen Nationalbibliothek''. Wien: Holzhausen.&lt;/ref&gt; one copy of the map recently was discovered in the store-rooms of the [[Shenyang#Museums|Shenyang Museum]] in China. A world search is currently in progress by Kendall Whaling Museum of Massachusetts.&lt;ref name="Battistini"/&gt; Hong Weilian,&lt;ref name="Kao"/&gt; earlier established a list of twelve total Ricci maps, which differs considerably from Day’s findings.&lt;ref name="Ptak"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ptak|first=Roderich|year=2005 |title=The Sino-European Map ("Shanhai yudi quantu") in the Encyclopedia Sancai tuhui |publisher=[http://www.humanismolatino.online.pt Humanismo Latino]|pages=1–17|url=http://www.humanismolatino.online.pt/v1/pdf/C003-022.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1607 or 1609 the ''[[Shanhai Yudi Quantu]]'', is a Chinese map which was published in the geographical treatise [[Sancai Tuhui]].  The Shanhai Yudi Quantu was influenced highly by the work of [[Matteo Ricci]].&lt;ref&gt;Ptak, p.1&lt;/ref&gt; Matteo Ricci had several of his own maps entitled ''Shanhai Yudi Quantu''.&lt;ref&gt;Ptak, p.3&lt;/ref&gt; The locations in the map have been identified and translated by Roderich Ptak in his work, ''The Sino-European Map (“Shanhai yudi quantu”), in the Encyclopedia Sancai tuhui'':&lt;ref name="Ptak"/&gt;

About 1620 [[Giulio Aleni]] made the world map ''[[Wanguo Quantu]]'' (萬國全圖, lit. "Complete map of all the countries"), putting China at the center of the world map, following Ricci's format and contents, but in a much smaller size (49&amp;nbsp;cm x 24&amp;nbsp;cm). This map was included in some editions of Aleni's geographical work, ''[[Zhifang waiji]]''. (Descriptions of Foreign Land) His 1623 preface states that another Jesuit, [[Diego de Pantoja]] (1571–1618), on the command of the emperor, had translated a different European map, also following Ricci's model, but there is no other knowledge of that work.&lt;ref name="Chen"/&gt;

In 1633, the Jesuit, [[Francesco Sambiasi]] (1582–1649), composed and annotated another world map, entitled ''Kunyu Quantu'' (Universal Map of the World), in [[Nanjing]].

In 1674, [[Ferdinand Verbiest]] developed the ''[[Kunyu Quantu]]'', a similar map, but with various improvements.&lt;ref name="Verbiest"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://u21museums.unimelb.edu.au/museumcollections/glasgow/hunterian/map.html|title=KUNYU QUANTU (A Map of the Whole World)|last=Verbiest|first=Ferdinand |year=1674|work=Museum's Gateway|publisher=[[University of Melbourne]], [[Universitas 21]]|accessdate=13 January 2010|location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of eight panels, each 179&amp;nbsp;cm x 54&amp;nbsp;cm, together displaying two hemispheres in [[Mercator projection]]. The two outer scrolls individually depict cartouches that contain several kinds of information on geography and meteorology.  The making of Verbiest's ''Kunyu Quantu'' was intended to meet the interest of the [[Kangxi Emperor]], as Verbiest's introductory dedication implies. There currently are at least fourteen or fifteen copies and editions of this map known in Europe, Japan, Taiwan, America, and Australia.&lt;ref name="Chen"/&gt;

==Religious significance==
Chen, Hui-hung discussed the religious meaning of the world maps that were produced by [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[Christian missionaries|missionaries]] in China from the late sixteenth to the seventeenth centuries. These world maps serve as a visual proof to emphasize the greatness of the world and the minuscule nature of humans. Through these maps people "can see" the truth of God because of the visual ability granted via God's omnipotence. Jesuit cartography was not only a visual image of geographical configuration: it paved the way for the comprehension of what they expressed as the Creator's significance.

It was an embodiment of the Renaissance tradition of cartography as the graphical representation of the universe. This includes the idea of understanding nature through mathematical science as well as understanding Heaven by visualization and sensibility. In this Renaissance tradition, geography was associated with [[cosmology]] that was based upon Christian theology. These maps expressed Aristotle's sensibility toward comprehension of the universe, which formed the core of Catholic epistemology and natural philosophy. The religious implications of Jesuit cartography in China are part of how the Jesuits used their cartographic superiority strategically in their evangelization.&lt;ref name="Chen"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chen|first=Hui-hung|date= July 2007 |title=The Human Body as a Universe: Understanding Heaven by Visualization and Sensibility in Jesuit Cartography in China |journal=The Catholic Historical Review |publisher=The Catholic University of America Press  |volume=93|issue=3|pages= 517–552|issn=0008-8080 |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?url=http://www.britannica.com/bps/additionalcontent/18/27874241/THE-HUMAN-BODY-AS-A-UNIVERSE-UNDERSTANDING-HEAVEN-BY-VISUALIZATION-AND-SENSIBILITY-IN-JESUIT-CARTOGRAPHY-IN-CHINA |doi=10.1353/cat.2007.0236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ricci was a Jesuit priest whose mission was to convert the Chinese to Roman Catholicism. He thought that might be helped by demonstrating the superior understanding of the world that he believed grew out of Christian faith. The map’s text shows it as part of a diplomatic attempt by Ricci to affirm the greatness of his own religion and culture. Ricci declares that it offers testimony “to the supreme goodness, greatness and unity of Him who controls heaven and earth.”&lt;ref name="Rothstein"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/20/arts/design/20map.html?pagewanted=1|title=Map That Shrank the World|last=Rothstein|first=Edward |date=2010-01-19|work=New York Times, Arts, EXHIBITION REVIEW |publisher=New York Times Company|accessdate=20 January 2010|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kuurdak''' ({{lang-ky|куурдак}}, {{lang-kz|қуырдақ}}, {{lang-tk|gowurdak}}; Говурдак, {{ug|قورداق, ''қордақ''|qordaq}}, {{lang-uz|qovurdoq}}), transliterated with various spellings, is a traditional meat dish made in [[Central Asia]], especially among the [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]]. The name comes from a [[nominalisation]] of the word "roast", "fried", referring to how the food is made. It is described as "stewed brown meat".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyrgyzchildrensfuture.org/kyrgyz-culture/kyrgyz-recipes/kuurdak-chyz-byz/]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Les dialoguistes''''' ("The Dialoguers") is the [[French language]] popular term for a faction within the [[Algeria]]n political and military establishment during that country's [[Algerian Civil War|civil war]], which from 1992 pitted [[Islamism|Islamist]] [[Rebellion|rebels]] against a military-installed government. It was mostly used as contrast to ''[[les éradicateurs]]'', the hardline tendency within the security and political elite which saw no room for compromise with Islamist politicians, and believed that militant organizations should be eliminated through force, who were refusing talks with their representatives.

Supported by most of the opposition parties, notably in the 1995 [[Sant'Egidio Platform]], the ''dialoguiste'' faction eventually gained the upper hand, and the [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika|Bouteflika]] presidency (1999-) has been marked by [[amnesty|amnesties]] and attempt to draw Islamists back into constitutional politics.

'''Life imprisonment''' in [[Poland]] (''Kara dożywotniego pozbawienia wolności'' in [[Polish language]]) has an indeterminate length. It can be imposed for treason, assassination of Polish President, war of aggression, genocide, crimes against humanity, unlawful use of weapon of mass destruction, war crimes, murder, homicide and serious bodily harm resulting in death.

The prisoner must serve at least 25 years in order to be eligible for parole. The court may also choose to set a higher minimum term than 25 years at sentencing. Since the reintroduction of life imprisonment in 1995, the highest minimum term is 50 years.  By comparison, [[Life imprisonment in Canada|life sentences in Canada]], with the 25-year minimum non-parole period, are mandatory for [[high treason]] and, in some cases, [[Murder (Canadian law)|murder]], while the highest minimum term is 75 years (a sentence a judge can hand down to some murderers convicted of multiple counts of murder).

As of March 2007, 71 prisoners are serving a longer minimum term than 25 years: 39 convicts can apply for parole after 30 years, 24 after 35 years, 4 after 40 years and 2 after 50 years.

The [[President of Poland]] has the power to end the prisoner's life sentence by granting clemency at any time; however, this has never happened. As of 2009, there are more than 200 people serving life sentences in Polish prisons. All were convicted of murder. If no changes in law are made, prisoners serving life imprisonment will first become eligible for parole in 2020.

For a person under the age of 18, the maximum penalty is 25 years' imprisonment.

'''Noul Neamț Monastery''' ({{lang-ro|Mănăstirea Noul Neamț}}; {{lang-ru|Свято-Вознесенский Ново-Нямецкий монастырь}}) is an all-male [[Moldovan Orthodox Church|Moldovan Orthodox]] [[monastery]] located in [[Chiţcani]], near [[Bender, Moldova|Bender]] and [[Tiraspol]]. Geographically located in the historical region of [[Basarabia]], it is today controlled by the breakaway [[Transnistria]]n authorities. It is also known as '''Chițcani Monastery'''.

==Overview==
The name (which means "New Neamț" in English) signifies that the monastery is a successor of the [[Neamț Monastery]] in medieval [[Moldavia]].

The monastery was founded in 1861, when several monks from the Neamț monastery left and founded Noul-Neamț in Chițcani. The founding of the new monastery was a protest against the measures taken in [[United Principalities|United Principalities of Romania]] to [[Secularization of monastery estates in Romania|confiscate monastery estates]] and forbid the usage of Slavonic language in worship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.referat.ro/referate/Rena__351_terea_M_tirii_Noul_Neamt_06bab.htm Renașterea mînăstirii Noul Neamț]&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Chițcani, like all of Bessarabia, was part of the [[Russian Empire]] since 1812.

On 16 May 1962 Soviet authorities closed the monastery; the buildings became a hospital.

The monastery church was reopened in 1989, followed in 1991 by the Romanian-language school for Orthodox priests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crestinortodox.ro/Manastirea_Noul_Neamt___lavra_Basarabiei-24-289.html Noul Neamț monastery, article in "Lumea Credinței"] {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1992, the town is controlled by the internationally not recognised state of [[Transnistria]].

'''''Plasă''''' ({{IPA-ro|ˈplasə}}, plural ''plăși'' {{IPA-ro|ˈpləʃʲ|}}) was a territorial division unit of [[Romania]], ranking below  [[Counties of Romania|county]] (''[[județ]]'') and above [[Communes of Romania|commune]]. It was headed by a ''[[Praetor#Recent Praetors|Pretor]]'', appointed by the [[Prefect (Romania)|county Prefect]]. The institution headed by the Pretor was called ''Pretură''.

The division of counties into ''plăși'' was used starting from the rule of [[Carol I of Romania|Carol I]] as ''[[Domnitor]]'', throughout the existence of a [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian Kingdom]], and during the first two years of [[Communist Romania]], until they were replaced in 1950 by [[raion]]s, following the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] system.&lt;ref&gt;"Legea nr. 5 pentru raionarea administrativ-economică a teritoriului Republicii Populare Romîne" (published in ''[[Monitorul Oficial|Buletinul Oficial]]'', No. 77 / September 8, 1950); Ronald A.

In 1931 a new transmitting station was opened in the district of Lipówka ({{coord|54.6535259|25.3019179|dim:100|format=dms}}). It had one 16&amp;nbsp;kW transmitter (increased to 50&amp;nbsp;kW in 1936) and an antenna mounted between two 70 meter towers. Yet another station was under construction in the district of Krzyżówka ({{coord|54.7019724|25.2269448|dim:100|format=dms}}), but the outbreak of [[World War II]] prevented its completion.

Among most popular broadcasts there was daily transmission of Roman Catholic mass services from the famous [[chapel]] of [[Gate of Dawn|Ostra Brama]].

The Lipówka station was bombed by German [[Luftwaffe]] on September 16, 1939, during Germany's [[Polish September Campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;Die Berichte des Oberkommandos der Wehrmacht 1939-1945. Köln : Parkland Verlag, 2004. {{ISBN|3-89340-063-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
On September 1, 1926, the first experimental radio programme (25 minutes duration) called “Voice of Yerevan” was transmitted in Armenia. The first test programmes were mainly folk music programmes regularly interrupted by local news, putting into operation the first radio station in Armenia. This created new wide-range perspectives for moving the amateur radio movement forward, radiofication and planned development of radio and wired broadcasting networks. The creation of radio station made  it  possible  to  use  radio  broadcasting  as  one  of  the most efficient mass media for informing and educating the population. That is why radio programs were expected to cover such topics, which would interest people of different specialties and meet their needs.

On June 15, 1927, Armenian Republican Radio started to broadcast its programmes on regular basis. In the early years only Yerevan and surrounding villages were included in the broadcasting radius. Due to efforts of a group of radio lovers radio service was provided in more than 25 villages in 1927, and in another 40 the following year.

On April 6, 1927, national print media published the first radio program consisting of news and concerts.

Up till 1929 actors and journalists from newspaper editorials were being invited to conduct the radio programmes. And only in December 1929 the first radio hosts - Vergine Babayan and Suren Kananyan were invited to work at the Republican Radio of Armenia.  
&lt;br /&gt;At the end of 1929 the Republican radio committee was formed. The committee had 12 employees and annually aired 2,160-hour programmes. In 1930s the audience was significantly expanded. New technical and creative capabilities were put in use.

During the post-war period the Republican radio opened a number of new editorial departments, extended the radius of radio transmissions, in 1947 started to operate the second channel (music and information), created new programmes and projects, increased broadcasting hours, as well as expanded its audience. In 1947 the radio committee was reorganized into radio informative committee attached to the Council of Ministers of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic.
[[File:Ալեք Մանուկյան փողոց 06.JPG|thumb|Public Radio building in Yerevan]]
The building of new radio transmitters was put into operation in 1957. In 1962 the whole territory of Armenia was provided with radio service. In 1965 an editorial compilation fund for recordings for author performances and radio records was formed. Radio Gold Fund contains more than 20,000 (150,000 hours) sound records, music performances, art and poetry programs and radio performances.

The invaluable collection of sound documents involves the well-known voices of Haykuhi Garagash, Vahram Papazyan, Hrachya Nersisyan, Babken Nersisyan, Hrachuhi Jinanyan, Khoren Abrahamyan, Metaqsya Simonyan, Edgar Elbakyan, Garush Khajakyan, Tamar Demuryan, Marat Halajyan, Sos Sargsyan, Vladimir Abajyan, Vera Hakobyan, Silva Yuzbashyan, Svetlana Khanumyan, Sargis Najaryan, Karen Vardanyan, etc.

==Radio Day==
Radio Day is a celebration of the development of radio. It is marked on 7 May, the day in 1895 on which Alexander Popov successfully demonstrated his invention. Radio Day was first observed in the Soviet Union in 1945. It emphasizes the importance and role of radio in political, social and cultural life of the country.

==Public Radio of Armenia – Active member of the EBU==
At the 56th General Assembly of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), held on July 7–8, 2005 in Dubrovnik (Croatia), the Public Television and Radio Company of Armenia became a fully-fledged member of this professional association of national broadcasters. Since 2004 PTRC was an associated member of the EBU. Thus, the Public Radio of Armenia gained the right to rebroadcast programs and participate in the projects of EBU.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In 2007 “Arevik” junior ensemble of Public Radio of Armenia was selected to represent Armenia for the first time at Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2007 in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Arevik came second for Armenia with the song Erazanq. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In 2013 Public Radio of Armenia launched a web portal, with the help of the EBU,  that connects producers and audiences of radio programmes targeted at young people across Europe. The LyunSe International portal aggregates current affairs stories from youth radio programmes across Europe and encourages interaction through a set of specialised forums. The portal’s development was supported by the EBU Partnership Programme and developed in Yerevan and Geneva.

==Public Radio of Armenia – International news==
On August 8, 1947 the decision was made to create an editorial group, which would prepare radio programs for Armenians living abroad. The first programme of this department was transmitted on Short Wave on August 10, 1947. USSR People’s Artist Vahram Papazyan reported the joyous news of kicking off the permanent programmes for diaspora. From 1957, in addition to broadcasts to the Middle East and Near East, broadcasts to the Western European countries were launched. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Currently Public Radio of Armenia is the only mass media in Armenia, which provides programmes in 14 languages (English, French, Spanish, German, Russian, Georgian, Arabic, Turkish, [[Persian language|Persian]], Azerbaijani, Kurdish, Yazidi, Assyrian and Greek) [http://www.armradio.info www.armradio.info]

==International Public Radio of Armenia==
''International Public Radio of Armenia'' ({{lang-hy|Հայաստանի հանրային ռադիո}}) is the [[international broadcasting]] service, established in 1967 under the label ''Radio Yerevan''.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome S. Berg, ''Broadcasting On The Short Waves, 1945 To Today'' (McFarland, 2008), p159&lt;/ref&gt; International Public Radio of Armenia broadcast on shortwave before 2006, then switching to online broadcasts. It broadcasts in a number of languages, including [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], [[English language|English]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[French language|French]], [[Georgian language|Georgian]], [[German language|German]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and [[Turkish language|Turkish]].

==Ensembles and Orchestras==

Currently the Public Radio of Armenia owns four orchestras – “Sayat-Nova” Minstrel Song Ensemble, Symphonic Ensemble, Folk Instruments Ensemble after Aram Merangulyan and “Arevik” junior ensemble. Each of them has left an indelible imprint on the history of Armenian radio.

The alleged '''raid''' '''on''' '''Amdjereme''' took place in [[Amdjereme]], [[Chad]] on March 6, 2006, only two weeks after [[Chad]] and [[Sudan]] signed the [[Tripoli Accord]] in which the governments of the two nations pledged to end support for rebels operating in their respective countries. According to Chadian forces, the attack began when [[Janjaweed]], [[Sudan]]ese [[militia]]men, aided by the [[Government of Sudan]], crossed the border from Sudan into Chad and raided the town of Amdjereme. According to Chadian Minister of Communications [[Hourmadji Moussa Doumgor]] the Janjaweed stole "700 camels, 1,000 cows and 1,500 sheep and other goods belonging to these peaceful citizens. This new janjawid attack constitutes a flagrant violation of the Tripoli Accord and the Sudanese government should be held responsible. This latest incursion by Sudanese government militia undermines efforts backed by the African Union and Libya to seek a lasting solution to the conflict between the two countries."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=58379 "CHAD: Government accuses Sudan of more attacks against civilians near border"], IRIN, March 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the government report, the Chadian military exchanged gunfire with the rebels and chased them back into Sudan. They recovered and returned the livestock to the citizens of Amdjereme.

The [[Government of Chad]] has accused Sudan of supporting [[United Front for Democratic Change]] rebels in the past, such as the [[Battle of Borota]] and the first and [[Second Battle of Adré]]. [[Chadian President]] [[Idriss Déby]] is especially concerned over recent high-level defections from the Chadian military to Sudan. The attack was the second in the region in three days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Reuters|title=Chad sacks 70 army officers after defections|date=2006-03-11|url=http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?page=imprimable&amp;id_article=14486}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SABC 1''' is a public service [[South African]] television channel broadcast by the [[South African Broadcasting Corporation]] (SABC) which carries programming in [[English language|English]] and [[Nguni languages|Nguni]].

It was created in 1996, after the SABC restructured its television channels. SABC 1 carried much of its programming over from the defunct CCV (Contemporary Community Values) channel, which was itself made up of the old TV2, TV3 and TV4 channels created in the 1980s. SABC 1 generates the widest audience in South Africa due to its programming diversity, airing SABC's longest running soap-opera, ''[[Generations (South African TV series)|Generations]]'', ''[[Uzalo]]'' and ''[[Skeem Saam]]''. The slogan for the channel is "Mzansi fo sho".
==History==
On 1 January 1982, two services were introduced, TV2 broadcasting in [[Zulu language|Zulu]] and [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]] and TV3 broadcasting in [[Sotho language|Sotho]] and [[Tswana language|Tswana]], both targeted at a Black urban audience.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rJ-uCwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA222&amp;ots=Sln_AqxOpB&amp;dq=TV2%20broadcasting%20in%20Zulu%20and%20Xhosa%20and%20TV3%20broadcasting%20in%20Sotho%20and%20Tswana%2C&amp;pg=PA222#v=onepage&amp;q=TV2%20broadcasting%20in%20Zulu%20and%20Xhosa%20and%20TV3%20broadcasting%20in%20Sotho%20and%20Tswana,&amp;f=true ''The Press and Apartheid: Repression and Propaganda in South Africa''], William A. Hachten, C.Anthony Giffard
Springer, 1984, page 222&lt;/ref&gt; The main channel, now called TV1, was divided evenly between English and Afrikaans, as before. In 1985, a new service called TV4 was introduced, carrying sports and entertainment programming, using the channel shared by TV2 and TV3, which stopped broadcasting at 9:30pm.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NcQZ1D366t8C&amp;lpg=PA69&amp;ots=1YrdQsOkYU&amp;dq=%22Topsport%20Surplus%22%20sabc&amp;pg=PA68#v=onepage&amp;q=%22TV4%22%20%20&amp;f=true ''Communication and Democratic Reform in South Africa''], Robert B. Horwitz, Cambridge University Press, 2001, page 68&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, TV2, TV3 and TV4 were combined into a new service called CCV (Contemporary Community Values).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=RxB1AAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22contemporary+community+values%22+sabc&amp;dq=%22contemporary+community+values%22+sabc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi-5_PD3fjKAhUkJJoKHbH-Dw8Q6AEILDAC ''South Africa: Official Yearbook of the Republic of South Africa''], Department of Information, 1992, page 131&lt;/ref&gt; A third channel was introduced known as TSS, or TopSport Surplus, TopSport being the brand name for the SABC's sport coverage, but this was replaced by NNTV (National Network TV), an educational, non-commercial channel, in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-NRDAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22nntv%22+sabc&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22february+11%22++ ''The voice, the vision: a sixty year history of the South African Broadcasting Corporation''], Malcolm Theunissen, Victor Nikitin, Melanie Pillay, Advent Graphics, 1996, page 127&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1996, the SABC reorganised it's three TV channels with the aim of making them more representative of the various language groups. These new channels were called SABC 1, SABC 2 and SABC 3.

SABC's head office and studio is based in [[Auckland Park]], [[Johannesburg]] and they also have offices in [[Cape Town]].

'''''Snowden''''' is a 2016 [[Biographical film|biographical]] [[thriller film]] about [[Edward Snowden]]. Directed by [[Oliver Stone]] and written by Stone and Kieran Fitzgerald, the film, based on the books ''[[The Snowden Files]]'' by [[Luke Harding]] and ''Time of the Octopus'' by [[Anatoly Kucherena]], stars an [[ensemble cast]] that includes [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]] as the title character, [[Edward Snowden]], with [[Shailene Woodley]], [[Melissa Leo]], [[Zachary Quinto]], [[Tom Wilkinson]], [[Scott Eastwood]], [[Logan Marshall-Green]], [[Timothy Olyphant]], [[Ben Schnetzer]], [[Keith Stanfield|LaKeith Lee Stanfield]], [[Rhys Ifans]] and [[Nicolas Cage]] also starring. Filming began on February 16, 2015 in [[Munich]], [[Germany]].

''Snowden'' screened at [[San Diego Comic-Con International|Comic-Con]] on July 21, 2016, before premiering at the [[2016 Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 9, 2016. The film was theatrically released in the United States on September 16, 2016, by [[Open Road Films]] and on September 22 in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2016/07/emma-roberts-dave-franco-nerve-star-trek-beyond-sausage-party-comic-con-1201788479/ |title=Emma Roberts-Dave Franco Thriller 'Nerve' To Sneak At Comic-Con |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=July 19, 2016|accessdate=July 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics, who praised Gordon-Levitt's performance but criticized the screenplay. It was also a [[box office bomb|box office disappointment]], grossing $37.3 million worldwide against its $40 million budget.&lt;ref name="BOM"/&gt;

==Plot==
In 2013, [[Edward Snowden]] arranges a clandestine meeting in [[Hong Kong]] with [[Documentary film|documentarian]] [[Laura Poitras]] and [[journalist]] [[Glenn Greenwald]]. They discuss releasing the classified information in the former’s possession regarding illegal [[mass surveillance]] conducted by the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA).

In 2004, Snowden is undergoing basic training, having enlisted in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] with intentions of matriculating to the [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Special Forces]]. He eventually fractures his [[tibia]], and is informed that he will be receiving an administrative discharge and that he may serve his country in other ways.

Snowden applies for a position at the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) and subsequently undergoes the screening process. Initially, his answers to the screening questions are insufficient, but [[Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency|Deputy Director]] Corbin O'Brian decides to take a chance on him, given the demands of such extraordinary times. Snowden is then brought to "The Farm" where he is educated and tested on [[cyberwarfare]]. He learns about the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]], which circumvents the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] rights of U.S. citizens by allowing warrant requests to be approved by a panel of judges that were appointed by the [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]]. Snowden and his peers are each tasked with building a covert communications network in their hometown, deleting it, and then rebuilding it in eight hours or less, with five hours being the average time taken. Snowden impresses O'Brian when he completes the exercise in 38 minutes.

Meanwhile, Snowden meets Lindsay Mills via a dating website. The two bond, despite sharply contrasting political ideologies. Snowden acquires his first post abroad working with diplomatic cover in [[Geneva]] in 2007, taking Mills with him. He meets Gabriel Sol, who has ample experience in electronic surveillance. Snowden begins questioning the ethical implications of their assignment. After his superior decides to set up their target on a [[Driving under the influence|DUI]] charge in order to leverage information from him, Snowden resigns from the CIA.

Snowden later takes a position with the NSA in [[Japan]], initially under the pretense of building a program that would allow the government to back up all critical data from the [[Middle East]] in an emergency, a program which he names "Epic Shelter". Snowden learns of the practices the NSA and other U.S. government agencies are using not just in Japan, but in most countries which the U.S. is currently allied with, which include planting [[malware]] in different computers that manage government, infrastructure and financial sectors so that, in the event that any allies turn against the US, that country can effectively be shut down in retaliation. The stress associated with the job results in the end of his relationship with Mills, who moves back with her family in [[Maryland]].

Three months later, Snowden has left his post with the NSA and returned to Maryland where he and Mills resume their relationship and he takes a position consulting for the CIA. During a hunting trip, O'Brian reveals an operation in [[Oahu]] that revolves around counterattacking [[China|Chinese]] hackers. After Snowden is diagnosed with [[epilepsy]], Mills agrees that he should join the operation for she believes the environment in [[Hawaii]] may be beneficial for his health. Upon beginning his new job in "[[Hawaii Cryptologic Center|The Tunnel]]", an underground [[World War II]] bunker that has been re-purposed for massive electronic surveillance and [[Signals Intelligence|SIGINT]] operations, Snowden learns that Epic Shelter is actually providing real-time data that assists U.S. [[Unmanned combat aerial vehicle|drone]] pilots in launching lethal strikes against terror suspects in [[Pakistan]].

Snowden ultimately becomes disillusioned with what he is a part of. It culminates in Snowden smuggling a [[Secure Digital|microSD]] card into his office by way of a [[Rubik's Cube]], and loading all relevant data. He then tells his colleagues he is feeling ill and departs. He advises Mills to fly home to Maryland, after which he contacts Poitras and Greenwald to schedule the meeting.

With the help of journalist [[Ewen MacAskill]], the information is disseminated to the press on June 5, 2013, with additional leaks published in the following days. In the aftermath, with the help of MacAskill, Greenwald and Poitras, Snowden is smuggled out of Hong Kong on a flight bound for [[Latin America]] by way of [[Russia]]. However, the U.S. government revokes his passport, forcing him to remain in [[Moscow]] indefinitely. He is eventually granted [[right of asylum|asylum]] for three years, with Mills joining him at a later date. Snowden continues his [[activism]].

=== Development ===
[[File:Edward Snowden 2013-10-9 (1) (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Oliver Stone]] personally met [[Edward Snowden]] multiple times in [[Moscow]] and spent time researching what happened to him.]]

When [[Oliver Stone]] was first approached to help the film, he was hesitant. At the time, he was working on another controversial subject, about the last few years in the life of [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], with [[Jamie Foxx]] attached to star, and did not immediately wish to tackle a project as incendiary again.&lt;ref name="NSA"/&gt; He had been previously criticized for being too apathetic towards [[George W. Bush]] – despite calling him the second worst [[President of the United States|President]] in U.S. history only after [[Richard Nixon]] – in his film, ''[[W. (film)|W.]]'' (2008).&lt;ref name="Q&amp;A"/&gt; Nonetheless,&lt;ref name="reveal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/oliver-stone-reveals-details-his-905428|title=Oliver Stone Reveals Details About His 'Snowden' Biopic|first=Rhonda |last=Richford|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=June 22, 2016|accessdate=June 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a series of events and persuasion prompted him to finally agree to direct it. [[Glenn Greenwald]], the journalist who worked with [[Laura Poitras]] to break the Snowden story, asked him for some advice; a couple of months later, Snowden's Russian lawyer, [[Anatoly Kucherena]], contacted Stone via his producer asking to meet him.&lt;ref name="NSA"/&gt; Wanting to sell his book about Snowden, Kucherena arranged a meeting in [[Moscow]], in a secure place that Stone would not reveal. It was a fictional book, but Stone developed an interest towards it and called it "very [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]", in the sense that none of it is realistic. Stone, who did not know if Snowden would cooperate, was undecided whether to make a fictional film with an unnamed character or a story as realistic as possible.&lt;ref name="Q&amp;A"/&gt;

Stone began meeting with Edward Snowden in January 2014.&lt;ref name="meetings"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.rrstar.com/news/20160906/oliver-stone-gets-controversial-again-with-snowden|title=Oliver Stone gets controversial (again) with ‘Snowden’|first= Ed |last=Symkus|work=Register Star|date=September 6, 2016|accessdate=September 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first, Snowden was wary about the idea of turning his life into a film. Stone went to meet Snowden two more times in late May of that year,&lt;ref name="meetings"/&gt; and Snowden finally agreed to the idea and even decided to take part.

===Pre-production===
{{quote box|width=33%|align=right|quote="It's a very strange thing to do [a story about] an American man, and not be able to finance this movie in America.

Before production began, Stone and Gordon-Levitt met Snowden in 2015 in Moscow, where he had been living in exile with his girlfriend, Lindsay Mills, since evading the U.S. government's attempts to arrest him for espionage.  The U.S. government had revoked his passport while Snowden was trying to reach South America.&lt;ref name="NSA"/&gt; Gordon-Levitt described Snowden as a person who is akin to [[Philippe Petit]], whom Gordon-Levitt played in the 2015 film ''[[The Walk (2015 film)|The Walk]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/18/joseph-gordon-levitt-edward-snowden-the-walk-interview|title=Joseph Gordon-Levitt: 'Edward Snowden was warm, kind, thoughtful'|first=Tom |last=Lamont|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=September 18, 2015|accessdate=March 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Problems arose in Russia, however, as companies that were affiliated with the U.S. refused to become involved in the project,&lt;ref name="NSA"/&gt; and no studio was ready to support it. It became extremely difficult for Stone, who had to finance everything along with the producer.&lt;ref name="NSA"/&gt; Eventually, financing came through from France and Germany, and the film ended up being shot in Germany as a German production, with contracts being signed eight days before production began.&lt;ref name="NSA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="reveal"/&gt; Since the budget was too tight, Stone had to miss the funeral of his mother, who had died in America while filming was occurring in Germany. Going back to America would have meant that Stone would have had to cut four days of work, which he said he could not afford to do.&lt;ref name="Q&amp;A"/&gt;

The film was released on September 16, 2016, alongside ''[[Blair Witch (film)|Blair Witch]]'', ''[[Bridget Jones's Baby]]'' and ''[[Hillsong: Let Hope Rise]]'', and was projected to gross around $10 million from 2,443 theaters in its opening weekend.&lt;ref name=preview&gt;{{cite web|title=Toronto: Can Oliver Stone's 'Snowden' Hack the Box Office? |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/tiff-2016-can-oliver-stones-927215 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=September 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It went on to open to $8 million, finishing 4th at the box office.

===Critical response===
''Snowden'' received mixed reviews from critics, although Gordon-Levitt's performance garnered critical praise. On [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 61%, based on 242 reviews, with an [[average score]] of 6.3/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "''Snowden'' boasts a thrilling fact-based tale and a solid lead performance from Joseph Gordon-Levitt, even if director Oliver Stone saps the story of some of its impact by playing it safe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/snowden |title=Snowden (2016) |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango]] | accessdate=August 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 58 out of 100, based on 43 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/snowden |title=Snowden Reviews|work=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=January 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref name="CinemaScore"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CsiDjG7WYAgK1eK.jpg |title=CinemaScore |work=cinemascore.com |accessdate=April 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/CinemaScore/status/777016320940470272 |title=CinemaScore |work=cinemascore.com |accessdate=April 3, 2017 |via=[[Twitter]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://m.cinemascore.com |archive-url=https://archive.is/20150405021357/http://m.cinemascore.com/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2015-04-05 |title=CinemaScore |work=cinemascore.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

[[Richard Roeper]] gave the film three out of four stars, saying, "''Snowden'' works best when it's just Edward and the three journalists in that hotel room, sweating it out, or when we see the pattern of events that led him to commit acts that exposed the shocking practices of our own government that also quite possibly created serious security breaches."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chicago.suntimes.com/entertainment/in-snowden-oliver-stone-depicts-the-nsa-leaker-as-pure-hero/ |title=In ‘Snowden,’ Oliver Stone depicts the NSA leaker as pure hero |website=Chicago Sun Times |accessdate=September 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Soup''' is a primarily liquid [[food]], generally served warm or hot (but may be cool or cold), that is made by combining [[ingredients]] of [[meat]] or [[vegetable]]s with [[Stock (food)|stock]], [[juice]], water, or another [[liquid]]. Hot soups are additionally characterized by boiling solid ingredients in liquids in a pot until the flavors are extracted, forming a [[broth]].

In traditional French cuisine, soups are classified into two main groups: ''clear soups'' and ''thick soups''. The established [[France|French]] classifications of clear soups are ''[[bouillon (broth)|bouillon]]'' and ''[[consommé]]''. Thick soups are classified depending upon the type of thickening agent used: ''[[purée]]s'' are vegetable soups thickened with [[starch]]; ''[[Bisque (food)|bisques]]'' are made from puréed [[shellfish]] or vegetables thickened with ''[[cream]]''; cream soups may be thickened with [[béchamel sauce]]; and ''[[velouté sauce|veloutés]]'' are thickened with [[egg (food)|eggs]], [[butter]], and cream. Other ingredients commonly used to thicken soups and broths include egg,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bhg.com/recipes/how-to/cooking-techniques/thickening-soups/ Thickening Soups]. Bhg.com. Retrieved on 2 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; [[rice]], [[lentils]], [[flour]], and [[grain]]s; many popular soups also include pumpkin, carrots, and potatoes.

Soups are similar to [[stew]]s, and in some cases there may not be a clear distinction between the two; however, soups generally have more liquid (broth) than stews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.journalgazette.net/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20081109/FEAT0103/811090311 |title=Soup vs. stew: Difference in details |last=Goltz |first=Eileen |publisher=The Journal Gazette (Fort Wayne, Indiana) |date=9 November 2008 |accessdate=6 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811025536/http://www.journalgazette.net/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20081109%2FFEAT0103%2F811090311 |archivedate=11 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:William-Adolphe Bouguereau (1825-1905) - Soup (1865).jpg|left|thumb|upright|''Soup''&lt;br&gt;([[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]], 1865)]]

Evidence of the existence of soup can be found as far back as about 20,000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wu | first1 = X. | last2 = Zhang | first2 = C. | last3 = Goldberg | first3 = P. | last4 = Cohen | first4 = D. | last5 = Pan | first5 = Y. | last6 = Arpin | first6 = T. | last7 = Bar-Yosef | first7 = O. | doi = 10.1126/science.1218643 | title = Early Pottery at 20,000 Years Ago in Xianrendong Cave, China | journal = Science | volume = 336 | issue = 6089 | pages = 1696–1700 | year = 2012 | pmid =  22745428| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Boiling was not a common cooking technique until the invention of [[waterproof]] containers (which probably came in the form of [[Pottery|clay]] vessels). Animal hides and watertight baskets of bark or reeds were used before this. To boil the water hot rocks were used. This method was also used to cook acorns and other plants.

The word ''soup'' comes from [[Latin (language)|French]] ''soupe'' ("soup", "broth"), which comes through [[Vulgar Latin]] ''suppa'' ("bread soaked in broth") from a [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] source, from which also comes the word "[[sop]]", a piece of [[bread]] used to soak up soup or a thick [[stew]].

The word ''[[restaurant]]'' (meaning "[something] restoring") was first used in [[France]] in the 16th century, to refer to a highly concentrated, inexpensive soup, sold by street vendors, that was advertised as an [[antidote]] to physical [[Fatigue (medical)|exhaustion]]. In 1765, a Parisian entrepreneur opened a shop specializing in such soups. This prompted the use of the modern word ''restaurant'' for the eating establishments.

In the [[United States|US]], the first [[wikt:colonial|colonial]] [[cookbook]] was published by William Parks in [[Williamsburg, Virginia]], in 1742, based on Eliza Smith's ''[[The Compleat Housewife]]; or Accomplished Gentlewoman's Companion'', and it included several recipes for soups and bisques. A 1772 cookbook, ''The Frugal Housewife'', contained an entire chapter on the topic. English cooking dominated early colonial cooking; but as new [[immigration|immigrants]] arrived from other countries, other national soups gained popularity. In particular, [[German people|German]] immigrants living in [[Pennsylvania]] were famous for their [[potato]] soups. In 1794, Jean Baptiste Gilbert Payplat dis Julien, a refugee from the [[French Revolution]], opened an eating establishment in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] called "[[Julien's Restorator|The Restorator]]", and became known as the "Prince of Soups". The first American cooking [[pamphlet]] dedicated to soup recipes was written in 1882 by Emma Ewing: ''Soups and Soup Making''.

[[Portable soup]] was devised in the 18th century by boiling seasoned meat until a thick, [[wikt:resin|resinous]] [[wikt:syrup|syrup]] was left that could be dried and stored for months at a time.

==Commercial products==
[[File:Joseph Campbell Company (3093577454).jpg|thumb|upright|An advertisement for Campbell's canned soup, circa 1913]]
Commercial soup became popular with the invention of [[canning]] in the 19th century, and today a great variety of canned and dried soups are on the market.

===Canned===

Canned soup (condensed with liquid added, also called "ready-to-eat") can be prepared by simply heating in a [[cookware and bakeware|pan]], rather than actually [[cooking]] anything. It can be made on the stovetop or in the microwave. Such soups can be used as a [[Cooking base|base]] for homemade soups, with the consumer adding anything from a few vegetables to eggs, meat, cream or pasta.
[[John Thompson Dorrance|Doctor John T. Dorrance]], a chemist with the [[Campbell Soup Company]], invented [[condensed soup]] in 1897.&lt;ref name="Campbells history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.campbellsoupcompany.com/history.asp|title=Campbell's: Our Company, History|work=Campbellsoupcompany.com|date=2005|accessdate=2 May 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306153157/http://www.campbellsoupcompany.com/history.asp|archivedate=6 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Genovese2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Genovese|title=New Jersey Curiosities: Quirky Characters, Roadside Oddities and Other Offbeat Stuff|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tudmT08W9xMC&amp;pg=PA174|accessdate=26 January 2016|year=2006|publisher=Globe Pequot Press|isbn=978-0-7627-4112-0|page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tin can|Canned]] soup can be condensed, in which case it is prepared by adding [[water]] (or sometimes [[milk]]), or it can be "ready-to-eat", meaning that no additional liquid is needed before eating. Condensing soup allows soup to be packaged into a smaller can and sold at a lower price than other canned soups. The soup is usually doubled in volume by adding a "can full" of water or milk, about {{Conv|10|USfloz|}}.

Since the 1990s, the canned soup market has burgeoned, with non-condensed soups marketed as "ready-to-eat", so they require no additional liquid to prepare.{{Cn|date=March 2018}} Microwaveable bowls have expanded the "ready-to-eat" canned soup market even more, offering convenience (especially in workplaces), and making for popular lunch items. In response to concerns over the negative health effects of [[High sodium|excessive]] [[salt]] intake, some soup manufacturers have introduced reduced-salt versions of popular soups.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/19980124033214/http://www.cspinet.org/nah/decsoup.htm Hurley, J. and Liebman, B. Soups: The Middle Ground. Nutrition Action December 1997]. Cspinet.org. Retrieved on 2 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, Campbell's [[Tomato Soup|Tomato]] (introduced in 1897), [[Cream of mushroom soup|Cream of Mushroom]], and [[Chicken Noodle]] (introduced in 1934) are three of the most popular soups in America. Americans consume approximately 2.5 billion bowls of these three soups alone each year.&lt;ref name="Campbells history" /&gt; Other popular brands of soup include [[Progresso]].

===Dried===
[[File:Maruchan Instant Lunch.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Dried ramen noodle soups are popular lunch items.]]

Dry soup mixes are sold by many manufacturers, and are reconstituted with hot water; other fresh ingredients may then be added.

The first dried soup was [[bouillon cube]]s; the earlier [[meat extract]] did not require refrigeration, but was a viscous liquid.

East Asian-style [[instant noodle]] soups include [[ramen]] and seasonings, and are marketed as a convenient and inexpensive instant meal, requiring only hot water for preparation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nissinfoods.com/company/about.php About Nissin Foods] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024113621/http://www.nissinfoods.com/company/about.php |date=24 October 2007 }}. Nissinfoods.com. Retrieved on 2 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Western-style dried soups include vegetable, chicken base, potato, pasta and [[cheese soup|cheese]] flavors.

==Types==
[[File:Soup Course.jpg|thumb|Soup course]]
{{mainlist|List of soups}}
In French cuisine, soup is often served before other dishes in a meal. In 1970, Richard Olney gave the place of the entrée in a French full menu: "A dinner that begins with a soup and runs through a fish course, an entrée, a sorbet, a roast, salad, cheese and dessert, and that may be accompanied by from three to six wines, presents a special problem of orchestration".&lt;ref&gt;Olney, ''The French Menu Cookbook'' 1970:22.&lt;/ref&gt;



===Dessert===
* ''[[Chè]]'', a Vietnamese cold dessert soup containing sugar and coconut milk, with many different varieties of other ingredients including [[taro]], [[cassava]], [[adzuki bean]], [[mung bean]], [[jackfruit]], and [[durian]].
* ''[[Ginataan#Sweet variants|Ginataan]]'', Filipino soup made from [[coconut]] milk, milk, fruits and [[tapioca]] pearls, served hot or cold

* [[Chinese desserts#Soups|Chinese dessert soups]] include ''[[douhua]]'' and [[black sesame soup]]

===Fruit===
{{main|Fruit soup}}
Fruit soups are prepared using fruit as a primary ingredient, and may be served warm or cold depending on the recipe. Many varieties of fruit soups exist, and they may be prepared based upon the availability of seasonal fruit.

===Cold===
[[File:Salmorejo cordouan.JPG|thumb|[[Salmorejo]] is a thick variant of [[gazpacho]] originating from [[Andalusia]].]]
Cold soups are a particular variation on the traditional soup, wherein the temperature when served is kept at or below room temperature. They may be sweet or savory. In summer, sweet cold soups can form part of a [[dessert]] tray. An example of a savory chilled soup is ''[[gazpacho]]'', a chilled vegetable-based soup originating from Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koreanamericanmommy.com/2010/07/korean-cold-beef-arrowroot-noodle-soup.html Korean Cold Beef Arrowroot Noodle Soup, Mool Naeng Myun (칡냉면) &amp; A Surprise Pairing].

A feature of East Asian soups not normally found in Western cuisine is the use of [[tofu]] in soups. Many traditional East Asian soups are typically broths, "clear soups", or [[starch]] thickened soups.

'''Thor''' (previously known as '''Marcopolo''') is a family of [[Communications satellite|satellites]] designed, launched and tested by [[Hughes Space and Communications]] (now part of [[Boeing Satellite Systems]]) for [[British Satellite Broadcasting]] (BSB), and were used for [[United Kingdom|Britain]]'s [[Direct Broadcast Service]]. Thor is owned by [[Telenor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/space/bss/factsheets/376/bsb/bsb.html BSB History by Boeing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090120074306/http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/space/bss/factsheets/376/bsb/bsb.html |date=2009-01-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Marcopolo 1 launched on 27 August 1989 on the 187th launch of a [[Delta (rocket)|Delta]] rocket, and Marcopolo 2 launched on 17 August 1990, on a Delta II rocket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/space/bls/missions/index.html|title=Boeing Launch Services Mission Record|publisher=Boeing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marcopolo I had the Hughes designation HS376.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasm.si.edu/research/arch/findaids/pdf/Desind_Finding_Aid.pdf] NASM's Herbert Stephen Desind Collection,p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the satellites performed as designed, BSB&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tbs-satellite.com/tse/online/sat_bsb_1.html BSB1]&lt;/ref&gt; merged with [[Sky Television plc|Sky Television]] to form [[British Sky Broadcasting]] and the BSB satellites were sold off and renamed. This also resulted in the obsoletion of the [[Squarial]] satellite-reception antenna, which was designed to operate with Thor 1 only.

==Marcopolo 1 (Sirius 1/Sirius W)==
[[Sirius 1 (satellite)|Sirius W]], previously known as Sirius 1, was launched on 27 August 1989. It was [[Hughes Space and Communications]]'s first satellite. Marcopolo 1 was sold in December 1993 to [[Nordic Satellite AB]] of Sweden and operated until 2000 as Sirius 1 at 5°E. It was then moved to 13°W, and renamed Sirius W. It had 5 K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band transponders.

==Marcopolo 2 (Thor 1)==
Marcopolo 2 was launched on 18 August 1990. It had 5 K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band transponders. It was sold in July 1992 to [[Telenor]] of [[Norway]] and renamed Thor 1. It was located at 0.8°W. It was switched off in January 2002, and in November of that year it was moved to 7.4°W and reactivated with digital test signals broadcasting toward [[Scandinavia]]. Marcopolo 2 was sent up to the [[junk orbit]] in early January 2003.

==Thor 2==
Thor 2 was launched on 21 May 1997, and retired in 2008 although it remained in an inclined geostationary orbit until January 2013 when it de-orbited to the graveyard orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Clover|first=Julian|title=Thor II de-orbited after 15 years|url=http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2013/01/14/thor-ii-de-orbited-after-15-years/|publisher=Broadband TV News|accessdate=14 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It weighs 1467&amp;nbsp;kg, and has 15 K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band transponders, with 3 spares, powered by 40-watt traveling-wave tube amplifiers (TWTAs).

==Thor 3==
Thor 3 (the "3" is officially "III") was a [[satellite]] used by [[Canal Digital]] in the Nordic areas for [[Direct To Home|DTH]] services. It launched on 9 June 1998 with an expected lifetime at 12 years, and was located at 0.8°W. It had 14 active K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band transponders powered by 47-watt traveling-wave tube amplifiers (TWTAs). The satellite was targeted on [[Scandinavia]], [[East Europe|Eastern Europe]], and parts of [[Central Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;http://telenorsbc.com/templates/Page.aspx?id=377&lt;/ref&gt; Thor 3 is still in operation and is flying in inclined geostationary orbit but has been pointed towards the middle east. Thor 3 was replaced by Thor 6 in June 2010.

==Intelsat 10-02 (Thor 4)==
[[Intelsat|Intelsat 10-02]] was launched on 16 June 2004, located at 1°W, and was beamed toward [[Central Europe]] and the [[Middle East]].

==Thor 5==
Thor 5 was launched on 11 February 2008. It was first planned that the satellite would be called Thor 2R', but Telenor named it Thor 5. It has 24 active K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band transponders.

==Thor 6==
Thor 6 was launched&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telenorsbc.com/templates/Page.aspx?id=777 Telenor Satellite Broadcasting]&lt;/ref&gt; from the Guiana Spaceport on 29 October 2009. Telenor Satellite Broadcasting announced on 15 December that Thor 6 had completed all necessary in-orbit and ground-related testing and would commence commercial service in late December.

Thor 6 has 36 K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band transponders. It provides direct-to-home television broadcasting services from the orbital location 0.8°W. It replaced Thor 3.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telenorsbc.com/templates/Page.aspx?id=796 Telenor Satellite Broadcasting]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thor 7==
Thor 7 has been built by [[SSL (company)|SSL]]. It was successfully launched by [[Arianespace]] from [[Kourou]] spaceport on 26 April 2015. It will mainly serve maritime customers and have a total capacity of 9 Gbit/sec. It was launched in tandem with the Italian/French [[Sicral]] 2 defense satellite.

'''Unit 124''' was a [[North Korean Special Operation Force]]s unit, in the [[Korean People's Army]] (KPA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bolger|first=Daniel|title=Scenes from an Unfinished War: Low intensity conflict in Korea 1966-1969|publisher=Diane Publishing Co|isbn=978-0-7881-1208-9|year=1991|page=Figure 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty-one men from the unit were handpicked to raid the [[Blue House]] and assassinate South Korean president [[Park Chung-hee]] in 1968.&lt;ref name="JoongAng Daily"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2912061|title=A would-be assassin builds a new life|publisher=JoongAng Daily|date=4 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Blue House raid]] failed, with 29 members of the unit being killed and one, [[Kim Shin-jo]], captured. Just one member of the unit, [[Pak Jae-gyong]], made it back to North Korea.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3125">'''William de Falaise''' (11th century), also called '''William of Falaise''', was a Norman from [[Falaise, Calvados|Falaise]], [[Duchy of Normandy]], today in the [[Calvados (department)|Calvados]] [[Departments of France|department]] in the [[Lower Normandy]] [[Regions of France|region]] of north-western France. He became [[English feudal barony|feudal baron]] of [[Stogursey]] in Somerset and also held manors in Devon.

==Biography==
William married Geva de Burci (her second husband), who was the daughter and sole heiress of [[Serlo de Burcy]], feudal baron of Blagdon, Somerset, which barony is sometimes stated to be of Dartington, Devon, as the ''[[caput]]'' cannot be clearly assigned exclusively to either place.&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, Ivor J., ''English Baronies'', Oxford, 1960, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Geva's first husband was "Martin" (died before 1086) for whom she produced a son and heir, Robert FitzMartin (died 1159), who with his descendants were feudal barons of Blagdon. William's daughter and sole heiress to the feudal barony of Stogursey was Emma of Falaise, who married [[William de Courcy (died circa 1114)|William de Courcy]] (died about 1114), to whose descendants the barony of Stogursey passed. The Devon lands of William of Falaise however passed to the FitzMartin family, feudal barons of Blagdon, who were sometimes seated at his former manor of Dartington.
