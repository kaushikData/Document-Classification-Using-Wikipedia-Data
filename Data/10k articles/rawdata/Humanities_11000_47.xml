'''Alain Touraine''' ({{IPA-fr|tuʁɛn|lang}}; born 3 August 1925) is a [[France|French]] [[sociology|sociologist]].  He is research director at the [[École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales]], where he founded the ''Centre d'étude des mouvements sociaux''. He is best known for being the originator of the term "[[post-industrial society]]".

==Work==
Touraine's work is based on a "sociology of action", which he called "actionalism",&lt;ref&gt;Volkmar Gessner, David Nelken, ''European Ways of Law: Towards a European Sociology of Law'' (2007), p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; and believes that society shapes its future through structural mechanisms and its own social struggles. Touraine defined historicity as the capability of a society to take action upon itself, see ''The Self-Production of Society'' (1977).

His  prime interest for most of his career has been with [[social movements]].  He has studied and written extensively on workers' movements across the world, particularly in [[Latin America]]. In [[Poland]] where he observed and {{citation needed span|text=aided|date=July 2014}} the emergence of [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarnosc]].  While in Poland, he developed the research method of "Sociological Intervention," which had been outlined in "The Voice and the Eye" (''La Voix et le Regard'') [1981].

Touraine has gained popularity in Latin America as well as in continental [[Europe]].  He has failed to gain the same recognition in the English-speaking world, although half of his books have been translated into English. He participated in 1969 at the Universitas project{{clarify|date=May 2016}} organized by Argentine architect [[Emilio Ambasz]].

== Honours ==
In 2010, he was jointly awarded, with [[Zygmunt Bauman]], the Príncipe de Asturias Prize for Communication and the Humanities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fpa.es/en/press/news/alain-touraine-and-zygmunt-bauman-prince-of-asturias-award-for-communication-and-humanities/] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531174332/http://www.fpa.es/en/press/news/alain-touraine-and-zygmunt-bauman-prince-of-asturias-award-for-communication-and-humanities/ |date=May 31, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Touraine received the [[Legion d’Honneur|Légion d’Honneur]] in 2014 during his daughter [[Marisol Touraine|Marisol]]’s mandate as [[Minister of Social Affairs (France)|French Minister of Social Affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2014/04/20/legion-d-honneur-alain-touraine-francoise-de-panafieu-et-renaud-lavillenie-parmi-les-promus_4404385_823448.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Athenians Project''' is a multi-year, ongoing project of compiling, computerizing and studying data about the persons of ancient [[Athens]].  By applying modern technology to ancient data, over a 100,000 entries have been digitized and maintained in an [[Empress Embedded Database]] for over 30 years.  The project is headed by Professor John S. Traill of the [[University of Toronto]] in the Classics Department.&lt;ref&gt;Traill, John.  [http://classics.chass.utoronto.ca/index.php/resources/document-archive/doc_download/9-classics-newsletter-2003-may “Classics: Athenians Research Project”] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706211337/http://classics.chass.utoronto.ca/index.php/resources/document-archive/doc_download/9-classics-newsletter-2003-may |date=2011-07-06 }},  "Classics: Athenians Research Project" Faculty of Arts and Science, University of Toronto, Volume 10, May 2003, retrieved November 3, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The Athenians Project began back in the 1970s to preserve and make searchable the age-faded, handwritten card-files of Dr.[[Benjamin Dean Meritt]].  Meritt had written information about the persons of ancient Athens and accumulated the card files over the preceding 40 years.  This included data collected by [[:de:Johannes Kirchner|Johannes Kirchner]] who also lent his work to the field of [[epigraphy]] and [[prosopography]] of ancient Athens in his book ''[[:de:Prosopographia Attica|Prosopographia Attica]]''.  Published back in 1901, Kirchner's ''Prosopographia Attica'' had 15,588 entries, was limited to the pre-Augustan period, and contained only registered Athenian citizens.&lt;ref name="A Prosopography of Ancient Athens"&gt;Traill, John.  [http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/attica/vols.htm  “A Prosopography of Ancient Athens”],  "A Prosopography of Ancient Athens", retrieved October 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Athenians Project data is available in two main parts. The first is a set of hardbound printed volumes titled "Persons of Ancient Athens" of more than 100,000 entries and typeset in ancient Greek. The second is a relational database of Athenians data which is used to search data using a computer in a variety of ways for further study.  The Athenians prosopography Project includes Athenian citizens at home and abroad, slaves, resident aliens, and foreigners honored at Athens—all the known men and women of Athens from the beginning of alphabetic writing to the Byzantine period.&lt;ref name="A Prosopography of Ancient Athens"/&gt;

Part of the data is made available to anyone via the [http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/attica/ Website Attica].  Website Attica is designed to be complementary to the published volumes of "Persons of Ancient Athens" (PAA).&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Charles Ellwood.

"Athenian Settlements of the Fourth Century B.C.", (1995), pp IX&lt;/ref&gt;

Searches in the Website Attica may be made on about 10,000 names, all within half of volume four, the entirety of volume five, and the first third of volume six of "Persons of Ancient Athens", i.e. names beginning with the letters beta through delta. The possible searches range from selecting every person in a particular [[Deme]] or of a specified profession to more sophisticated searches, e.g. to find all Athenians who lived between specified years and/or are related to a certain person and/or are attested in a class of document, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Traill, John.

== History ==
The Athenians Project is the lifeblood of Professor Emeritus John Traill, a world-renowned expert and instructor in "[[Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] Scientific Terminology" at the University of Toronto.  He has published 24 books and edited an additional 5 books on Greek inscriptions, the topography of Athens and Attica, and on the people of ancient Athens.  For the last 3 decades he has directed the Athenians Project.&lt;ref name="Biography of John Traill"&gt;[http://classics.chass.utoronto.ca/index.php/faculty/faculty-list/45-john-traill/ ”Biography of John Traill”] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706211333/http://classics.chass.utoronto.ca/index.php/faculty/faculty-list/45-john-traill/ |date=2011-07-06 }}, University of Toronto, retrieved October 10, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  At the beginning of the 1980s, Traill, with the support of the University of Toronto, applied for and received a Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada research grant to use relational database software technology to store the ancient Athenian data. During the next 30 years, over 100,000 entries have been entered as ancient Greek characters and stored using an [[Empress Embedded Database]].  

John Traill's project had its origin in the work of [[Benjamin Dean Meritt]] to maintain current data on Athenian prosopography.  Like Traill, Meritt saw the potential of the computer to make his paper resources at the Institute for Advanced Study dynamic and expandable.  By 1972 Traill was at work entering data.&lt;ref&gt;Rigsby, Kent J., [http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/1995/95.03.39.pdf “Three Books on Greek/Roman Names/Prosopography”] "Three Books on Greek/Roman Names/Prosopography" - {{ISBN|0-19-814990-5}}, 1994, Bryn Mawr Classical Review, retrieved October 12, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  Meritt was an emeritus professor of Greek [[epigraphy]] at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] at Princeton.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/08/obituaries/dr-benjamin-merritt-emeritus-professor-90.html “Obituary: Dr. Benjamin Merritt, Emeritus Professor, 90”] "The New York Times", July 8, 1989, retrieved October 12, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the Meritt card-file at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, "Persons of Ancient Athens" also includes full references with texts to document each biographical fact.&lt;ref name="A Prosopography of Ancient Athens"/&gt;

Based originally at [[Victoria University in the University of Toronto]], formerly Victoria College, Athenians Project is now located in the Department of Classics at the University of Toronto.&lt;ref name="Biography of John Traill"/&gt;

'''Basilea''' was the first queen of the legendary [[Kingdom of Atlantis]] in  [[ancient Greek]] folk tradition.

Basilea was the eldest and one of the most celebrated daughters of [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]], who had forty-five children by various wives, including [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]] and [[Pandora]]. Basilea became known as the “Great Mother” due to the solicitous way in which she cared for her younger brothers.&lt;ref name=Spence&gt;{{cite book|last=Spence|first=Lewis|title=The History of Atlantis|year=2007|publisher=Cosimo, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; After her father’s death, she was elected Queen of [[Atlantis]] by popular vote. She married her brother [[Hyperion (mythology)|Hyperion]] and had two children: [[Selene]] and [[Helios]], the goddess of the moon and god of the sun, respectively. However, her other brothers murdered Hyperion, for fear that he might usurp the throne, and drowned Helios in the River [[Eridanos (mythology)|Eridanus]] or [[River Po|Po]] in Italy. Out of love for her brother, Selene committed [[suicide]] by jumping from a rooftop. Upon learning of the death of her children, Basilea went mad and “wandered up and down, with hair disheveled and bedizened with ornaments, playing wildly on the timbrel and cymbal.”&lt;ref name=Spence/&gt; When the people of Atlantis tried to restrain her, she disappeared into a terrible lightning storm. In honor of Basilea and her children, divine rites were established.

Basilea is often confused for [[Theia]], the more accepted mother of Selene, Helios, and in addition, Eos, and wife to Hyperion. It is unsure whether or not they are the same figure.

Basilea is also mentioned quite differently in other versions. She is listed as a daughter of [[Coelus]] and [[Terra (mythology)|Terra]],&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=A compendium of heathen mythology|author=Gilbert, E.A.|date=1849|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mlAEAAAAQAAJ|page=14|accessdate=2015-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=10,000 Names for Your Baby|author=Ishizuka, K.|date=2010|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|isbn=9780307756947|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UcSiNRKiAPEC|page=116|accessdate=2015-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is implied to be the mother of all gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UcSiNRKiAPEC&amp;pg=PA116 |accessdate=July 18, 2014 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also implied that she is another version of [[Aphrodite]] ([[Ancient Rome|Roman]], [[Venus]]).&lt;ref name="google3"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Gods of Homer and Virgil; Or, Mythology for Children|date=1837|publisher=J.

The '''Beijing Ming City Wall Ruins Park''' ({{zh|c={{linktext|北京|明|城墙|遗址|公园}}|p=Běijīng Míng Chéngqiáng Yízhǐ Gōngyuán}}) is a park in [[Beijing]] with the longest and best preserved section of the city's [[Ming Dynasty]] [[Beijing city fortifications|city wall]].  The park is located {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on|lk=on}} from the city center and extends west from [[Chongwenmen]] to Dongbianmen and then north to near the [[Beijing Railway Station]].  The park features a {{convert|1.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} section of the Ming city wall and the Southeast Corner Tower, which are over 550 years old and surrounded by green park space to the south and east.   The park covers an area of {{convert|15.5|ha|acre|abbr=on|lk=on}}, including {{convert|3.3|ha|acre|abbr=on|lk=on}} of fortifications and {{convert|12.2|ha|acre|abbr=on|lk=on}} of green space.&lt;ref name="Article1"&gt;(Chinese) [http://www.visitbeijing.com.cn/lvgl/n214769680.shtml  "听老韩头讲述明城墙遗址的故事"] 2012-11-14&lt;/ref&gt;  Access to the corner tower and the ramparts atop the wall is available during business hours and require paying admission. The corner tower also houses the [[Red Gate Gallery]]. The rest of the park is free and open to the public at all times.

==Location and access==
[[File:Beijing city wall map vectorized.svg|thumb|right|250px|Map of Beijing's Ming City walls.  The Relics Park preserves the section of the wall between Chongwenmen and Dongbianmen.]]
The park is located at the southeast corner of Beijing's inner walled city, about {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on|lk=on}} southeast of [[Tiananmen Square]] in what is now [[Dongcheng District, Beijing|Dongcheng District]], just inside the [[Second Ring Road]].  Preserved in the park is a section of the city wall including the Southeast Corner Tower, that once connected [[Chongwenmen]] and Dongbianmen, two city gates that have been replaced with roadway intersections.  The longer southern city wall is attached to the Southeast Corner Tower itself while a shorter section of the eastern city wall is separated from the corner tower by a railway out of the [[Beijing Railway Station]].  Park space at the foot of the southern city wall extends along Chongwenmen East Avenue to the [[Second Ring Road]].  The [[Beijing Ancient Observatory]], built atop another section of the eastern city wall at [[Jianguomen]], is a short walk north of the corner tower.  The [[Beijing Railway Station]] and its rail depots occupy the area immediately north of the park.

The corner tower's exhibits and [[Defensive wall|ramparts]] are open from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm.  Admission is Y10 for adults, half-price for students.  Children below 1.2 m in height and senior citizens are admitted for free.  The park space is not enclosed and is accessible to the public at all hours.  The park is popular with tourists visiting the wall and residents from the surrounding neighborhood, who use the green space for recreation and [[dog walking]]. The park hosts the annual [[Huashi, Beijing|Huashi]] [[Saturn Peach]] Temple Festival.&lt;ref&gt;(Chinese) [http://www.bjdch.gov.cn/n5687274/n5723715/n5749247/12464113.html 区档案馆连续七届全程跟踪拍摄蟠桃宫庙会留存城市记忆 2013年04月12日]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ming City Wall Relics Park is accessible by [[Beijing Bus]] to '''Dongbianmen''' (Routes 25, 29, 39, 43, 44, 59, 434, 525, 610, 674 and 特2), '''Chongwenmen East''' (Routes 12, 25, 39, 43, 44, 525, 610)  and '''Jianguomen South''' (Routes 25, 39, 43, 44, 52, 122, 434, 637, 638, 750 and 特2); and by [[Beijing Subway]] to [[Chongwenmen Station|Chongwenmen]] ([[Line 2, Beijing Subway|Line 2]]) and [[Jianguomen Station|Jianguomen]] ([[Line 1, Beijing Subway|Lines 1]] and [[Line 2, Beijing Subway|2]]).

Beijing's inner city wall was built during the [[Ming Dynasty]] in 1419.&lt;ref name="Article1"/&gt; The Ming city walls stood for nearly 550 years until the early 1960s when most of the gates and walls were torn down to build the [[Beijing Subway]], which runs underneath where the walls stood.  The subway's [[Line 2, Beijing Subway|inner loop line]] turned into the Inner City at Chongwenmen to stop at the [[Beijing Railway Station]], and did not need to run beneath a section of the wall at the southeast corner of the Inner City.  Of the 40&amp;nbsp;km of the original wall, only this 1.5&amp;nbsp;km section was spared.  Inside this section of the wall (north of the wall) are railway yards of Beijing Station.  Outside the wall (south of the wall) stood residential homes and small businesses.  
[[File:Ming Wall Detail.jpg|thumb|left|200px|About one-fifth of the two million bricks used to restore the wall are from the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming era]].]]
In the late 1990s, the city government decided convert the remnants of the wall into a park and relocate the small businesses and homes between the foot of the southern city wall and Chongwenmen East Avenue.  The relocated businesses and residents received compensation and tax exemptions.&lt;ref&gt;(Chinese) [http://house.sina.com.cn/n/r/2002-07-02/12438.html "腾退明城墙遗址 拆迁户买房可减免契税"北京娱乐信报 ''] 2002-07-02&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Chinese) [http://bj.people.com.cn/GB/21881/23808/950550.html 王刘芳, 杨玉峰 and 李继辉 "北京展示古都风貌 外国记者应邀畅游遗址公园" ''北京晨报''] 2002-10-11&lt;/ref&gt;  Construction began in November 2001.  The homes, which lacked indoor heating, plumbing and running water, were razed but large trees that stood in the courtyards were preserved.

'''Benjamin Thorpe''' (1782 – 19 July 1870) was an English scholar of [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] [[literature]].

==Biography==
In the early 1820s he worked as a banker in the [[House of Rothschild]], in Paris. There he met [[Thomas Hodgkin]], who treated him for tuberculosis.&lt;ref&gt;Amalie M. Kass and Edward H. Kass, ''Perfecting the World: The life and times of Dr. Thomas Hodgkin, 1798–1866'' (1988), pp. 101–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

After studying for four years at [[Copenhagen University]], under the Danish [[philologist]] [[Rasmus Christian Rask]], Thorpe returned to England in 1830. In a few years he established a reputation as an Anglo-Saxon scholar.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In recognition of unremunerative work, Thorpe was granted a [[civil list pension]] of £160 in 1835, and on 17 June 1841 this was increased to £200 per annum. He was a [[Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London]], a member of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Munich, and of the Society of Netherlandish Literature at Leyden&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Thorpe, Benjamin}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died at [[Chiswick]] in July 1870.

==Bibliography==
In 1830 Thorpe brought out at Copenhagen an English version of Rask's ''Anglo-Saxon Grammar'' (a second edition of this appeared at London). That same year he moved to London with his new wife Mary Otte and her daughter [[Elise Otté]]. Thorpe educated and oppressed his step daughter and she had a troubled relationship and unattributed partnership with him throughout his life.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Seccombe, ‘Thorpe, Benjamin (1781/2–1870)’, rev. John D. Haigh, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/27375, accessed 17 Feb 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1832 he published at London ''Cædmon's Metrical Paraphrase of Parts of the Holy Scriptures in Anglo-Saxon; with an English Translation, Notes, and a Verbal Index'', which was well reviewed. It was followed in 1834 by the ''Anglo-Saxon Version of the Story of Apollonius of Tyre''&lt;ref&gt;''Anglo-Saxon Version of the Story of Apollonius of Tyre, upon which is founded the play of "Pericles," from a MS., with a Translation and Glossary''.&lt;/ref&gt; and by ''Analecta Anglo-Saxonica'', a textbook which was adopted at Oxford by [[Robert Meadows White]].&lt;ref&gt;''Analecta Anglo-Saxonica: a selection in prose and verse from Anglo-Saxon authors of various ages, with a Glossary'' (Oxford, 1834, 1846 and 1868).&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Analecta'' was used, with Vernon's ''Anglo-Saxon Guide'', for 40 years.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

In 1835 Thorpe published ''Libri Psalmorum Versio antiqua Latina''&lt;ref&gt;''Libri Psalmorum Versio antiqua Latina; cum Paraphrasi Anglo-Saxonica … nunc primum e cod. MS. in Bibl. Regia Parisiensi adservato'' (Oxford).&lt;/ref&gt; and then ''Ancient Laws and Institutes of England'' (1840).&lt;ref&gt;''Ancient Laws and Institutes of England, comprising the Laws enacted under the Anglo-Saxon Kings from Ethelbert to Canut, with an English Translation'' (London, 1840).&lt;/ref&gt; Two more volumes were published by Thorpe in 1842, ''The Holy Gospels in Anglo-Saxon''&lt;ref&gt;Based on Cod. Bibl. Pub. Cant. li. 2, 11, collated with Cod. C. C. C. Cambr., s. 4, 140.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Codex Exoniensis, a Collection of Anglo-Saxon Poetry, with English Translation and Notes'', an edition of the poems in the [[Exeter Book]] with English translation. Next came, for the [[Ælfric Society]], ''The Homilies of the Anglo-Saxon Church'',' with an English version, published in ten parts between 1843 and 1846.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

In 1834 Thorpe had begun a translation of [[Johann Martin Lappenberg]]'s works on old English history, but was deterred. By 1842 he had started another version, with alterations, corrections, and notes of his own; it was published in two volumes in 1845 as ''A History of England under the Anglo-Saxon Kings''. It was followed eventually by a version of Lappenberg's ''History of England under the Norman Kings'' (1857). Thorpe's two-volume edition of [[Florence of Worcester]] was issued in 1848–49.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Florentii Wigornensis monachi Chronicon ex Chronicis ab adventu Hengesti … usque ad annum mcxvii, cui accesserunt continuationes duæ'', collated and edited with English notes (London).&lt;/ref&gt;

For the publisher Edward Lumley Thorpe produced ''Northern Mythology'' (1851)&lt;ref&gt;''Northern Mythology, comprising the principal popular Traditions and Superstitions of Scandinavia, North Germany, and the Netherlands … from original and other sources'' (London, 3 vols.)&lt;/ref&gt; with notes and illustrations. It was followed in 1853 by  ''Yule Tide Stories''&lt;ref&gt;''Yule Tide Stories: a collection of Scandinavian Tales and Traditions''&lt;/ref&gt; which appeared in [[Bohn's Antiquarian Library]]. For the same library he translated in 1854 ''Pauli's Life of Alfred the Great'', with Alfred's Anglo-Saxon version of ''[[Orosius]]''. In 1855 appeared Thorpe's ''Anglo-Saxon Poems of Beowulf'', with translation, notes, glossary, and indexes. He had planned this work as early as 1830, and his text was collated with the [[Cottonian MS]] before [[John Mitchell Kemble]]'s; the scorched edges of the manuscript suffered further shortly afterwards.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

In 1861 Thorpe edited for the [[Rolls Series]] of ''The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, according to the several Authorities''. In the first volume are printed synoptically the Corpus Christi, Cambridge, the Bodleian, and the various Cottonian texts, with facsimiles and notes, while in volume two appeared the translation. Four years later, through the support of [[Joseph Mayer (antiquary)|Joseph Mayer]] of [[Liverpool]], Thorpe was able to publish his supplement to Kemble's ''Codex Diplomaticus ævi Saxonici''.&lt;ref&gt;''Diplomatarium Anglicum Ævi Saxonici: a Collection of English Charters (605–1066), containing Miscellaneous Charters, Wills, Guilds, Manumissions, and Aquittances, with a translation of the Anglo-Saxon’ (London).&lt;/ref&gt; His final work, done for [[Trübner &amp; Co|Trübner]] in 1866, was a translation of the ''[[Elder Edda]]''.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Edda Sæmundar Hinns Frôða: the Edda of Sæmund the Learned, from the old Norse or Icelandic'', with a mythological index and an index of persons and places, issued in two parts (London).&lt;/ref&gt;

His other works include ''The Homilies of the Anglo-Saxon Church'' (1844).

[[File:Carl Spitzweg 021.jpg|thumb|upright|[[The Bookworm (painting)|''The Bookworm'']], 1850, by [[Carl Spitzweg]]]]

'''Bibliophilia''' or '''bibliophilism''' is the love of books, and a '''bibliophile''' or '''bookworm''' is an individual who loves and frequently reads books, though bookworm is normally used pejoratively.

==Profile==
The classic bibliophile is one who loves to read, admire and collect books, often amassing a large and specialized collection. Bibliophiles usually possess books they love or that hold special value as well as old editions with unusual bindings, [[autograph]]ed, and/or illustrated copies.&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;{{cite book|last=Carter|first=John|title=ABC for Book Collectors|year=1952|url=http://www.ilab.org/download.php?object=documentation&amp;id=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage of the term==
Bibliophilia is not to be confused with [[bibliomania]], a potential symptom of [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]] involving the collecting of books to the extent that [[Interpersonal relationship|interpersonal relations]] or health may be negatively affected, and in which the mere fact that a physical object is a book is sufficient for it to be collected or beloved. Some use the term "bibliomania" interchangeably with "bibliophily", and in fact, the [[Library of Congress]] does not use the term "bibliophily," but rather refers to its readers as either book collectors or bibliomaniacs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/index.html Library of Congress]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[The New York Public Library]] follows the same practice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catnyp.nypl.org/search/a?a New York Public library search]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
According to Arthur H. Minters, the "private collecting of books was a fashion indulged in by many [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], including [[Cicero]] and [[Titus Pomponius Atticus|Atticus]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title=Collecting Books for Fun and Profit
|last=Minters
|first=Arthur H.
|location=New York
|publisher=Arco Publishing Inc.
|year=1979
|isbn=0-668-04598-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''bibliophile'' entered the [[English language]] in 1824.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bibliophile Merriam-Webster: bibliophile]&lt;/ref&gt; A bibliophile is to be distinguished from the much older notion of a bookman (which dates back to 1583), who is one who loves books, and especially [[Reading (process)|reading]]; more generally, a bookman is one who participates in writing, publishing, or selling books.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bookman Merriam-Webster: bookman]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Spencer, 2nd Earl Spencer|Lord Spencer]] and the [[George Spencer-Churchill, 5th Duke of Marlborough|Marquess of Blandford]] were noted bibliophiles. "The [[John Ker, 3rd Duke of Roxburghe|Roxburghe]] sale quickly became a foundational myth for the burgeoning secondhand book trade, and remains so to this day"; this sale is memorable due to the competition between "Lord Spencer and the marquis of Blandford [which] drove [the price of a probable first edition of Boccaccio's ''[[Decameron]]'' up to the astonishing and unprecedented sum of £2,260".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Connell|first=Philip|title=Book Collecting: Cultural Politics, and the Rise of Literary Heritage in Romantic Britain|journal=Representations|year=2000|volume=71|pages=24–47|doi=10.1525/rep.2000.71.1.01p00764}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[J. P. Morgan]] was also a noted bibliophile. In 1884, he paid $24,750 for a 1459 edition of the [[Mainz Psalter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Basbanes|first=Nicholas|authorlink=Nicholas A.

{{Literature}}

A '''book'''  is both a usually portable physical object and the body of immaterial representations or intellectual object whose material signs—written or drawn lines or other two-dimensional media—the physical object contains or houses. 

As a physical object, a book is a stack of usually rectangular [[page (paper)|pages]] (made of [[papyrus]], [[parchment]], [[vellum]], or [[paper]]) oriented with one side (either left or right, depending on the direction in which one reads a script) tied, sewn, or otherwise fixed together and then [[bookbinding|bound]] to the flexible spine of a protective [[book cover|cover]] of heavier, relatively inflexible material so that, when the opened front cover has received a massy enough stack of sheets, the book can lie flat.&lt;ref&gt;IEILS, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;  The technical term for this physical arrangement is [[Codex|''codex'']] (in the plural, ''codices''). In the history of hand-held physical supports for extended written compositions or records, the codex replaces its immediate predecessor, the [[scroll]].  

As an intellectual object, a book is prototypically a composition of such great length that it takes a considerable investment of time to compose and a still considerable, though not so extensive, investment of time to read. This sense of book has a restricted and an unrestricted sense. In the restricted sense, a book is a self-sufficient section or part of a longer composition, a usage that reflects the fact that, in antiquity, long works had to be written on several scrolls, and each scroll had to be identified by the book it contained. So, for instance, each part of [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' is called a book, as of course the Bible encompasses many different books.  In the unrestricted sense, a book is the compositional whole of which such sections, whether called books or chapters or parts, are parts.

But the intellectual content in a physical book need not be a composition, or can be called a book. Books can consist only of drawings, engravings, or photographs, or such things as crossword puzzles or cut-out dolls.  In a physical book the pages can be left blank or can feature an abstract set of lines as support for on-going entries, i.e., an account book, an appointment book, a log book, an autograph book, a notebook, a diary or day book, or a sketch book.  Some physical books are made with pages thick and sturdy enough to support other physical objects, like a scrapbook or photograph album.  

Books may be distributed in electronic form as [[e-book]]s and other formats. In its "Revised Recommendation concerning the International Standardization of Statistics on the Production and Distribution of Books, Newspapers and Periodicals" of 1 November 1985, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ([[UNESCO]]) stated that it was "convinced that it is desirable that the national authorities responsible for collecting and reporting statistics relating to the production and distribution of printed publications should be guided by certain standards in the matter of definitions, classification and presentation," and so "in order to improve the international comparability of statistics," it defined a book as "a non-periodic publication of at least 49 pages exclusive of the cover pages, published in the country and made available to the public" (11(a)), so that books statistics could be collected on "(a) Government publications, i.e., publications issued by public administrations or their subsidiary bodies, except for those which are confidential or designed for internal distribution only; (b) School textbooks, books prescribed for pupils receiving education at the first and second level as defined in the revised Recommendation concerning the International Standardization of Educational Statistics adopted by the General Conference; (c) University theses; (d) Offprints, i.e., reprints of a part of a book or a periodical already published, provided that they have a title and a separate pagination and that they constitute a distinct work; (e) Publications which form part of a series, but which constitute separate bibliographical units; (f) Illustrated works: (i) Collections of prints, reproductions of works of art, drawings, etc., when such collections form complete, paginated volumes and when the illustrations are accompanied by an explanatory text, however short, referring to these works or to the artists themselves; (ii) Albums, illustrated books and pamphlets written in the form of continuous narratives, with pictures illustrating certain episodes; (iii) Albums and picture-books for children; (iv) Comic books" (9-10).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13146&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|title=Revised Recommendation concerning the International Standardization of Statistics on the Production and Distribution of Books, Newspapers and Periodicals: UNESCO|website=portal.unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A single sheet in a codex  is a [[Recto|leaf]], and each side of a leaf is a [[page (paper)|page]].

Although in ordinary academic parlance a [[monograph]] is understood to be a specialist academic work, rather than a reference work on a single scholarly subject, in [[library and information science]] ''monograph'' denotes more broadly any non-serial publication complete in one [[Volume (bibliography)|volume]] (book) or a finite number of volumes (even a novel like Proust's seven-volume [[In Search of Lost Time|''In Search of Lost Time'']]), in contrast to serial publications like a [[magazine]], [[academic journal|journal]], or [[newspaper]]. An avid reader or collector of books or a book lover is a [[Bibliophilia|bibliophile]] or colloquially, "bookworm". A shop where [[Bookselling|books are bought and sold]] is a [[bookshop]] or bookstore. Books are also sold elsewhere. Books can also be borrowed from [[Lending library|libraries]]. [[Google]] has estimated that as of 2010, approximately 130,000,000 distinct titles had been published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://booksearch.blogspot.com/2010/08/books-of-world-stand-up-and-be-counted.html |date=August 5, 2010 |title=Books of the world, stand up and be counted! All 129,864,880 of you|accessdate=August 15, 2010 |quote=After we exclude serials, we can finally count all the books in the world. There are 129,864,880 of them. At least until Sunday. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some wealthier nations, the sale of printed books has decreased because of the use of [[Ebooks|e-books]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Curtis|first1=George|title=The Law of Cybercrimes and Their Investigations|date=2011|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; though sales of e-books declined in the first half of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/23/business/media/the-plot-twist-e-book-sales-slip-and-print-is-far-from-dead.html |date=September 22, 2015 |title=The Plot Twist: E-Book Sales Slip, and Print Is Far From Dead |accessdate=October 8, 2015 |publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The word book comes from [[Old English]] "bōc", which in turn comes from the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] root "*bōk-", [[cognate]] to "[[beech]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/book |title=Book |publisher=Dictionary.com |date= |accessdate=November 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- see American Heritage Dictionary and Online Etymology Dictionary --&gt; Similarly, in [[Slavic languages]] (for example, [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]) "буква" (bukva—"letter") is cognate with "beech". In Russian and in [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and Macedonian, the word "букварь" (bukvar') or "буквар" (bukvar) refers specifically to a primary school textbook that helps young children master the techniques of reading and writing.
It is thus conjectured that the earliest [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] writings may have been carved on beech wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northvegr.org/holy/b.php|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081103044850/http://www.northvegr.org/holy/b.php|dead-url=yes|archive-date=November 3, 2008|title=Northvegr - Holy Language Lexicon|date=November 3, 2008|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the Latin word ''codex'', meaning a book in the modern sense (bound and with separate leaves), originally meant "block of wood".

When [[History of writing|writing systems]] were created in [[ancient civilization]]s, a variety of objects, such as stone, [[clay tablet|clay]], tree bark, metal sheets, and bones, were used for writing; these are studied in [[epigraphy]].

==== Tablet ====
{{Main|Clay tablet|Wax tablet}}{{See also|Stylus}}

A tablet is a physically robust writing medium, suitable for casual transport and writing. [[Clay tablet]]s were flattened and mostly dry pieces of clay that could be easily carried, and impressed with a [[stylus]]. They were used as a writing medium, especially for writing in [[cuneiform]], throughout the [[Bronze Age]] and well into the [[Iron Age]]. [[Wax tablet]]s were pieces of wood covered in a thick enough coating of wax to record the impressions of a stylus. They were the normal writing material in schools, in accounting, and for taking notes. They had the advantage of being reusable: the wax could be melted, and reformed into a blank.

The custom of binding several wax tablets together (Roman ''pugillares'') is a possible precursor of modern bound (codex) books.&lt;ref&gt;Leila Avrin. ''Scribes, Script and Books'', p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; The etymology of the word ''codex'' (block of wood) also suggests that it may have developed from wooden wax tablets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Bischoff| first = Bernhard| others = Dáibhí ó Cróinin| title = Latin palaeography antiquity and the Middle Ages| url = https://books.google.com/?id=CFZgQgAACAAJ| year = 1990| publisher = Cambridge University Press| location = Cambridge| isbn = 978-0-521-36473-7| page = 11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Scroll ====
{{main article|Scroll}}
[[File:Egypt.Papyrus.01.jpg|thumb|left|Egyptian papyrus showing the god [[Osiris]] and the weighing of the heart.]]
Scrolls can be made from [[papyrus]], a thick [[paper|paper-like]] material made by weaving the stems of the papyrus plant, then pounding the woven sheet with a hammer-like tool until it is flattened. Papyrus was used for writing in [[Ancient Egypt]], perhaps as early as the [[First Dynasty of Egypt|First Dynasty]], although the first evidence is from the account books of King [[Nefertiti Kakai]] of the [[Fifth Dynasty]] (about 2400 BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

According to [[Herodotus]] (History 5:58), the [[Phoenicians]] brought writing and papyrus to Greece around the 10th or 9th century BC. The Greek word for papyrus as writing material (''biblion'') and book (''biblos'') come from the Phoenician port town [[Byblos]], through which papyrus was exported to Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Leila Avrin. ''Scribes, Script and Books'', pp. 144–45.&lt;/ref&gt; From Greek we also derive the word tome ({{lang-el|τόμος}}), which originally meant a slice or piece and from there began to denote "a roll of papyrus". ''Tomus'' was used by the Latins with exactly the same meaning as ''volumen'' (see also below the explanation by Isidore of Seville).

Whether made from papyrus, [[parchment]], or paper, scrolls were the dominant form of book in the Hellenistic, Roman, Chinese, Hebrew, and Macedonian cultures. The more modern [[codex]] book format form took over the Roman world by [[late antiquity]], but the scroll format persisted much longer in Asia.

==== Codex ====
[[File:Bamboo book - binding - UCR.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A Chinese [[bamboo and wooden slips|bamboo book]] meets the modern definition of Codex]]
{{main article|Codex}}
[[Isidore of Seville]] (d. 636) explained the then-current relation between codex, book and scroll in his Etymologiae (VI.13): "A codex is composed of many books; a book is of one scroll. It is called codex by way of metaphor from the trunks (''codex'') of trees or vines, as if it were a wooden stock, because it contains in itself a multitude of books, as it were of branches." Modern usage differs.

A codex (in modern usage) is the first information repository that modern people would recognize as a "book": leaves of uniform size [[bookbinding|bound]] in some manner along one edge, and typically held between two [[book cover|covers]] made of some more robust material. The first written mention of the codex as a form of book is from [[Martial]], in his Apophoreta &lt;small&gt;CLXXXIV&lt;/small&gt; at the end of the first century, where he praises its compactness. However, the codex never gained much popularity in the pagan Hellenistic world, and only within the Christian community did it gain widespread use.&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge History of Early Christian Literature. Edd. Frances Young, Lewis Ayres, Andrew Louth, Ron White. Cambridge University Press 2004, pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt; This change happened gradually during the 3rd and 4th centuries, and the reasons for adopting the codex form of the book are several: the format is more economical, as both sides of the writing material can be used; and it is portable, searchable, and easy to conceal. A book is much easier to read, to find a page that you want, and to flip through. A scroll is more awkward to use. The Christian [[author]]s may also have wanted to distinguish their writings from the pagan and Judaic texts written on scrolls. In addition, some metal books were made, that required smaller pages of metal, instead of an impossibly long, unbending scroll of metal. A book can also be easily stored in more compact places, or side by side in a tight library or shelf space.

==== Manuscripts ====
{{main article|Manuscript}}
[[File:RomanVirgilFolio014rVergilPortrait.jpg|thumb|left|Folio 14 recto of the 5th century [[Vergilius Romanus]] contains an author portrait of [[Virgil]]. Note the [[bookcase]] (''capsa''), reading stand and the text written without word spacing in [[rustic capitals]].]]

The fall of the [[Roman Empire]] in the 5th century AD saw the decline of the [[culture of ancient Rome]]. Papyrus became difficult to obtain due to lack of contact with Egypt, and parchment, which had been used for centuries, became the main writing material. Parchment is a material made from processed animal skin and used—mainly in the past—for writing on.
Parchment is most commonly made of calfskin, sheepskin, or goatskin. It was historically used for writing documents, notes, or the pages of a book. Parchment is limed, scraped and dried under tension. It is not tanned, and is thus different from leather. This makes it more suitable for writing on, but leaves it very reactive to changes in relative humidity and makes it revert to rawhide if overly wet.

Monasteries carried on the [[Latin literature|Latin]] writing tradition in the [[Western Roman Empire]]. [[Cassiodorus]], in the monastery of Vivarium (established around 540), stressed the importance of copying texts.&lt;ref&gt;Leila Avrin. ''Scribes, Script and Books'', pp. 207–08.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benedict of Nursia|St. Benedict of Nursia]], in his ''[[Rule of Saint Benedict]]'' (completed around the middle of the 6th century) later also promoted reading.&lt;ref&gt;[[Theodore Maynard]]. ''Saint Benedict and His Monks''. Staples Press Ltd 1956, pp. 70–71.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Rule of Saint Benedict'' (Ch. &lt;small&gt;XLVIII&lt;/small&gt;), which set aside certain times for reading, greatly influenced the monastic culture of the [[Middle Ages]] and is one of the reasons why the clergy were the predominant readers of books. The tradition and style of the Roman Empire still dominated, but slowly the peculiar medieval book culture emerged.

[[File:CodxAmiatinusFolio5rEzra.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Codex Amiatinus]] anachronistically depicts the Biblical [[Ezra]] with the kind of books used in the 8th Century AD.]]
Before the invention and adoption of the [[printing press]], almost all books were copied by hand, which made books expensive and comparatively rare. Smaller monasteries usually had only a few dozen books, medium-sized perhaps a few hundred. By the 9th century, larger collections held around 500 volumes and even at the end of the Middle Ages, the papal library in [[Avignon]] and Paris library of the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] held only around 2,000 volumes.&lt;ref&gt;Martin D. Joachim. Historical Aspects of Cataloguing and Classification. Haworth Press 2003, p. 452.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[scriptorium]]'' of the monastery was usually located over the [[chapter house]]. Artificial light was forbidden for fear it may damage the manuscripts. There were five types of scribes:
* '''Calligraphers''', who dealt in fine book production
* '''Copyists''', who dealt with basic production and correspondence
* '''Correctors''', who collated and compared a finished book with the manuscript from which it had been produced
* '''Illuminators''', who painted illustrations
* '''Rubricators''', who painted in the red letters

[[File:Escribano.jpg|thumb|left|Burgundian author and scribe [[Jean Miélot]], from his ''Miracles de Notre Dame'', 15th century.]]
The bookmaking process was long and laborious. The parchment had to be prepared, then the unbound pages were planned and ruled with a blunt tool or lead, after which the text was written by the [[scribe]], who usually left blank areas for illustration and [[rubrication]]. Finally, the book was bound by the [[bookbinding|bookbinder]].&lt;ref&gt;Edith Diehl. ''Bookbinding: Its Background and Technique''. Dover Publications 1980, pp. 14–16.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Milkau Bücherschrank mit angekettetem Buch aus der Bibliothek von Cesena 109-2.jpg|thumb|upright|Desk with chained books in the [[Malatestiana Library]] of [[Cesena]], [[Italy]].]]

Different types of ink were known in antiquity, usually prepared from soot and gum, and later also from [[gall]] nuts and [[Iron(II) sulfate|iron vitriol]]. This gave writing a brownish black color, but black or brown were not the only colors used. There are texts written in red or even gold, and different colors were used for illumination. For very luxurious manuscripts the whole parchment [[Purple parchment|was colored purple]], and the text was written on it with gold or silver (for example, [[Codex Argenteus]]).&lt;ref&gt;Bernhard Bischoff. ''Latin Palaeography'', pp. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Irish monks introduced spacing between words in the 7th century. This facilitated reading, as these monks tended to be less familiar with Latin. However, the use of spaces between words did not become commonplace before the 12th century. It has been argued that the use of spacing between words shows the transition from semi-vocalized reading into silent reading.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Saenger. ''Space Between Words: The Origins of Silent Reading''. Stanford University Press 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first books used [[parchment]] or [[vellum]] ([[calfskin]]) for the pages. The book covers were made of wood and covered with leather. Because dried parchment tends to assume the form it had before processing, the books were fitted with clasps or straps. During the later [[Middle Ages]], when public libraries appeared, up to the 18th century, books were often chained to a bookshelf or a [[desk]] to prevent theft. These chained books are called ''libri catenati''.

At first, books were copied mostly in monasteries, one at a time. With the rise of universities in the 13th century, the [[Manuscript culture]] of the time led to an increase in the demand for books, and a new system for copying books appeared. The books were divided into unbound leaves (''pecia''), which were lent out to different copyists, so the speed of book production was considerably increased. The system was maintained by secular [[stationery|stationers]] guilds, which produced both religious and non-religious material.&lt;ref&gt;Bernhard Bischoff. ''Latin Palaeography'', pp. 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Judaism]] has kept the art of the scribe alive up to the present. According to Jewish tradition, the [[Torah]] scroll placed in a [[synagogue]] must be written by hand on parchment and a printed book would not do, though the congregation may use printed prayer books and printed copies of the Scriptures are used for study outside the [[synagogue]]. A [[sofer]] "scribe" is a highly respected member of any observant Jewish community.

==== Middle East ====
{{Cite check|section|date=September 2010}}
People of various religious (Jews, Christians, Zoroastrians, Muslims) and ethnic backgrounds (Syriac, Coptic, Persian, Arab etc.) in the Middle East also produced and bound books in the [[Islamic Golden Age]] (mid 8th century to 1258), developing advanced techniques in [[Islamic calligraphy]], [[miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] and bookbinding. A number of cities in the medieval Islamic world had book production centers and book markets. Yaqubi (d. 897) says that in his time Baghdad had over a hundred booksellers.&lt;ref&gt;W. Durant, "The Age of Faith", New York 1950, p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; Book shops were often situated around the town's principal mosque &lt;ref&gt;S.E. Al-Djazairi "The Golden Age of Islamic Civilization", Manchester 2996, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; as in [[Marrakesh]], [[Morocco]], that has a street named ''Kutubiyyin'' or book sellers in English and the famous [[Koutoubia Mosque]] is named so because of its location in this street.

The medieval [[Muslim world]] also used a method of reproducing reliable copies of a book in large quantities known as [[Proofreading|check reading]], in contrast to the traditional method of a single scribe producing only a single copy of a single manuscript. In the check reading method, only "authors could authorize copies, and this was done in public sessions in which the copyist read the copy aloud in the presence of the author, who then certified it as accurate."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Edmund Burke|title=Islam at the Center: Technological Complexes and the Roots of Modernity|journal=[[Journal of World History]]|volume=20|issue=2|date=June 2009|doi=10.1353/jwh.0.0045|pages=165–86 [43]|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this check-reading system, "an author might produce a dozen or more copies from a single reading," and with two or more readings, "more than one hundred copies of a single book could easily be produced."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Edmund Burke|title=Islam at the Center: Technological Complexes and the Roots of Modernity|journal=[[Journal of World History]]|volume=20|issue=2|date=June 2009|doi=10.1353/jwh.0.0045|pages=165–86 [44]|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; By using as writing material the relatively cheap paper instead of parchment or papyrus the Muslims, in the words of Pedersen "accomplished a feat of crucial significance not only to the history of the Islamic book, but also to the whole world of books".&lt;ref&gt;Johs. Pedersen, "The Arabic Book", Princeton University Press, 1984, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Wood block printing ====

[[File:Traditional_Bagh_hand_block_print_master_craftsman-artisan-artist_Mohammed_Bilal_Khatri,_Madhya_Pradesh,_India.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Bagh Print]] Traditional woodblock printing in [[Bagh, Dhar|Bagh]] [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[India]].]]
In [[woodblock printing]], a relief image of an entire page was carved into blocks of wood, inked, and used to print copies of that page. This method originated in China, in the [[Han dynasty]] (before 220 AD), as a method of [[printing]] on [[textiles]] and later [[paper]], and was widely used throughout [[East Asia]]. The oldest dated book printed by this method is ''[[The Diamond Sutra]]'' (868 AD).The method (called ''[[Woodcut]]'' when used in art) arrived in Europe in the early 14th century. Books (known as [[Woodblock printing|block-books]]), as well as [[playing-cards]] and [[old master print|religious pictures]], began to be produced by this method. Creating an entire book was a painstaking process, requiring a hand-carved block for each page; and the wood blocks tended to crack, if stored for long. The monks or people who wrote them were paid highly.

==== Movable type and incunabula ====
[[File:Bucheinband.15.Jh.r.Inkunabel.jpg|thumb|upright|A 15th-century [[Incunable]]. Notice the blind-tooled cover, corner bosses and clasps.]]
{{main article|Movable type|Incunable}}
[[File:SelectedTeachingsofBuddhistSagesandSonMasters1377.jpg|thumb|left|''Selected Teachings of Buddhist Sages and Son Masters'', the earliest known book printed with movable metal type, 1377. [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]].]]

The Chinese inventor [[Bi Sheng]] made [[movable type]] of earthenware c. 1045, but there are no known surviving examples of his printing. Around 1450, in what is commonly regarded as an independent invention, [[Johannes Gutenberg]] invented movable type in Europe, along with innovations in casting the type based on a matrix and [[hand mould]]. This invention gradually made books less expensive to produce, and more widely available.

Early printed books, single sheets and images which were created before 1501 in Europe are known as [[incunable]]s or ''incunabula''. "A man born in 1453, the year of the fall of Constantinople, could look back from his fiftieth year on a lifetime in which about eight million books had been printed, more perhaps than all the scribes of Europe had produced since Constantine founded his city in AD 330."&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Clapham (industrialist)|Clapham, Michael]], "Printing" in ''A History of Technology'', Vol 2. ''From the Renaissance to the Industrial Revolution'', edd. Charles Singer ''et al.'' (Oxford 1957), p. 377. Cited from [[Elizabeth L. Eisenstein]], ''The Printing Press as an Agent of Change'' (Cambridge University, 1980).&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th century to 21st centuries===
Steam-powered printing presses became popular in the early 19th century. These machines could print 1,100 sheets per hour, but workers could only set 2,000 letters per hour.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} [[Monotype]] and [[linotype machine|linotype]] typesetting machines were introduced in the late 19th century. They could set more than 6,000 letters per hour and an entire line of type at once. There have been numerous improvements in the printing press. As well, the conditions for [[freedom of the press]] have been improved through the gradual relaxation of restrictive censorship laws. See also [[intellectual property]], [[public domain]], [[copyright]]. In mid-20th century, European book production had risen to over 200,000 titles per year.

Throughout the 20th century, libraries have faced an ever-increasing rate of publishing, sometimes called an [[information explosion]]. The advent of [[electronic publishing]] and the [[internet]] means that much new information is not printed in paper books, but is made available online through a [[digital library]], on [[CD-ROM]], in the form of e-books or other online media. An [[on-line book]] is an e-book that is available online through the internet. Though many books are produced digitally, most digital versions are not available to the public, and there is no decline in the rate of paper publishing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bowker.com/index.php/press-releases/616-bowker-reports-traditional-us-book-production-flat-in-2009 Bowker Reports Traditional U.S. Book Production Flat in 2009] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128205430/http://www.bowker.com/index.php/press-releases/616-bowker-reports-traditional-us-book-production-flat-in-2009 |date=January 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is an effort, however, to convert books that are in the [[public domain]] into a digital medium for unlimited redistribution and infinite availability. This effort is spearheaded by [[Project Gutenberg]] combined with [[Distributed Proofreaders]]. There have also been new developments in the process of publishing books. Technologies such as POD or "[[print on demand]]", which make it possible to print as few as one book at a time, have made self-publishing (and [[vanity publishing]]) much easier and more affordable. On-demand publishing has allowed publishers, by avoiding the high costs of warehousing, to keep low-selling books in print rather than declaring them out of print.

[[File:Urval av de bocker som har vunnit Nordiska radets litteraturpris under de 50 ar som priset funnits (2).jpg|thumb|The [[Bookbinding|spine]] of the book is an important aspect in [[book design]], especially in the cover design. When the books are stacked up or stored in a shelf, the details on the spine is the only visible surface that contains the information about the book. In stores, it is the details on the spine that attract buyers' attention first.]]

The methods used for the printing and binding of books continued fundamentally unchanged from the 15th century into the early 20th century. While there was more [[mechanization]], a [[book printer]] in 1900 had much in common with [[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg]]. [[Printing press|Gutenberg's invention]] was the use of movable metal types, assembled into words, lines, and pages and then printed by [[letterpress]] to create multiple copies. Modern paper books are printed on [[Printing and writing paper|papers]] designed specifically for printed books. Traditionally, book papers are off-white or low-white papers (easier to read), are opaque to minimise the show-through of text from one side of the page to the other and are (usually) made to tighter [[caliper]] or thickness specifications, particularly for case-bound books. Different paper qualities are used depending on the type of book: [[Machine finished coated paper]]s, [[woodfree uncoated paper]]s, [[coated fine paper]]s and [[special fine paper]]s are common paper grades.

Today, the majority of books are printed by [[offset lithography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BNCODAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA213&amp;dq=Today,+the+majority+of+books+are+printed+by+offset+lithography#v=onepage&amp;q=Today,%20the%20majority%20of%20books%20are%20printed%20by%20offset%20lithography&amp;f=false|title=The Complete Canadian Book Editor|last=Vermeer|first=Leslie|date=2016-08-31|publisher=Brush Education|isbn=9781550596779|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a book is printed, the pages are laid out on the plate so that after the printed sheet is folded the pages will be in the correct sequence. Books tend to be manufactured nowadays in a few standard sizes. The [[Book size|sizes of books]] are usually specified as "trim size": the size of the page after the sheet has been folded and trimmed. The standard sizes result from sheet sizes (therefore machine sizes) which became popular 200 or 300 years ago, and have come to dominate the industry. British conventions in this regard prevail throughout the English-speaking world, except for the USA. The European book manufacturing industry works to a completely different set of standards.

===Processes===

====Layout====
Modern bound books are organized according to a particular format called the book's ''layout''.  Although there is great variation in layout, modern books tend to adhere to as set of rules with regard to what the parts of the layout are and what their content usually includes.  A basic layout will include a ''front cover'', a ''back cover'', and the book's content which is called its ''body copy'' or ''content pages''.  The front cover often bears the book's title (and subtitle, if any) and the name of its author or editor(s).  The ''inside front cover'' page is usually left blank in both hardcover and paperback books.  The next section, if present, is the book's ''front matter'', which includes all textual material after the front cover but not part of the book's content— such things as a forward, a dedication, and a table of contents as well as publisher data such as the book's edition or printing number and place of publication.  Between the body copy and the back cover goes the ''end matter'' which would include any indices, sets of tables, or diagrams, glossaries, or lists of cited works (though an edited book with multiple contributing authors usually places cited works at the end of each authored chapter).   The ''inside back cover'' page, like that inside the front cover, is usually blank.  The ''back cover'' itself is the usual place for the book's [[ISBN]], and maybe a photograph of the author(s)/ editor(s), perhaps with a short introduction to them.  Also here often appear plot summaries, barcodes, and excerpted reviews of the book.&lt;ref name="ShellyStarks2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gary B. Shelly|author2=Joy L. Starks|title=Microsoft Publisher 2010: Comprehensive|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PSQJAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA559|date=6 January 2011|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-133-17147-8|page=559}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Printing====
[[File:Urval av de bocker som har vunnit Nordiska radets litteraturpris under de 50 ar som priset funnits.jpg|thumb|Book covers]]
Some books, particularly those with shorter runs (i.e. fewer copies) will be printed on sheet-fed offset presses, but most books are now printed on web presses, which are fed by a continuous roll of paper, and can consequently print more copies in a shorter time. As the production line circulates, a complete "book" is collected together in one stack, next to another, and another A [[web press]] carries out the folding itself, delivering bundles of ''signatures'' (sections) ready to go into the gathering line. Note that the pages of a book are printed two at a time, not as one complete book. Excess numbers are printed to make up for any spoilage due to make-readies or test pages to assure final print quality.

A ''make-ready'' is the preparatory work carried out by the pressmen to get the printing press up to the required quality of [[Impression (publishing)|impression]]. Included in make-ready is the time taken to mount the plate onto the machine, clean up any mess from the previous job, and get the press up to speed. As soon as the pressman decides that the printing is correct, all the make-ready sheets will be discarded, and the press will start making books. Similar make readies take place in the folding and binding areas, each involving spoilage of paper.

====Binding====
After the signatures are folded and gathered, they move into the [[bindery]]. In the middle of last century there were still many trade binders – stand-alone binding companies which did no printing, specializing in binding alone. At that time, because of the dominance of letterpress printing, typesetting and printing took place in one location, and binding in a different factory. When type was all metal, a typical book's worth of type would be bulky, fragile and heavy. The less it was moved in this condition the better: so printing would be carried out in the same location as the typesetting. Printed sheets on the other hand could easily be moved. Now, because of increasing [[Automation|computerization]] of preparing a book for the printer, the typesetting part of the job has flowed upstream, where it is done either by separately contracting companies working for the publisher, by the publishers themselves, or even by the authors. Mergers in the book manufacturing industry mean that it is now unusual to find a bindery which is not also involved in book printing (and vice versa).

If the book is a [[hardcover|hardback]] its path through the bindery will involve more points of activity than if it is a [[paperback]]. Unsewn binding, is now increasingly common. The signatures of a book can also be held together by "Smyth sewing" using needles, "McCain sewing", using drilled holes often used in schoolbook binding, or "notch binding", where gashes about an inch long are made at intervals through the fold in the spine of each signature. The rest of the binding process is similar in all instances. Sewn and notch bound books can be bound as either hardbacks or paperbacks.

===Finishing===
[[File:Urval av de bocker som har vunnit Nordiska radets litteraturpris under de 50 ar som priset funnits (3).jpg|thumb|Book pages]]
"Making cases" happens off-line and prior to the book's arrival at the binding line. In the most basic case-making, two pieces of cardboard are placed onto a glued piece of cloth with a space between them into which is glued a thinner board cut to the width of the spine of the book. The overlapping edges of the cloth (about 5/8" all round) are folded over the boards, and pressed down to adhere. After case-making the stack of cases will go to the [[foil stamping]] area for adding decorations and type.

==Digital printing==
Recent developments in book manufacturing include the development of digital printing. Book pages are printed, in much the same way as an office copier works, using [[toner]] rather than ink. Each book is printed in one pass, not as separate signatures. Digital printing has permitted the manufacture of much smaller quantities than offset, in part because of the absence of make readies and of spoilage. One might think of a web press as printing quantities over 2000, quantities from 250 to 2000 being printed on sheet-fed presses, and digital presses doing quantities below 250. These numbers are of course only approximate and will vary from supplier to supplier, and from book to book depending on its characteristics. Digital printing has opened up the possibility of print-on-demand, where no books are printed until after an order is received from a customer.

=== E-book ===
{{main article|e-book}}
[[File:Amazon Kindle 3.JPG|thumb|right|upright|A screen of a [[Amazon Kindle|Kindle]] e-reader.]]
In the 2000s, due to the rise in availability of affordable handheld computing devices, the opportunity to share texts through electronic means became an appealing option for media publishers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://libraries.pewinternet.org/2012/04/04/the-rise-of-e-reading/|title=The rise of e-reading|last=Rainie|first=Lee|last2=Zickuhr|first2=Kathryn|date=2012-04-04|website=Pew Internet Libraries|access-date=2017-02-02|last3=Purcell|first3=Kristen|last4=Madden|first4=Mary|last5=Brenner|first5=Joanna}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the "e-book" was made. The term e-book is a contraction of "electronic book"; it refers to a book-length publication in digital form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.builderbill-diy-help.com/what-is-an-ebook.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120722033703/http://www.builderbill-diy-help.com/what-is-an-ebook.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=July 22, 2012|title=What is an e-book|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; An e-book is usually made available through the internet, but also on CD-ROM and other forms. E-Books may be read either via a computing device with an LED display such as a traditional [[computer]], a [[smartphone]] or a [[tablet computer]]; or by means of a portable e-ink display device known as an e-book reader, such as the [[Sony Reader]], [[Barnes &amp; Noble Nook]], [[Kobo eReader]], or the [[Amazon Kindle]]. E-book readers attempt to mimic the experience of reading a print book by using this technology, since the displays on e-book readers are much less reflective.

== Design ==
{{main article|Book design}}

Book design is the art of incorporating the content, style, format, design, and sequence of the various components of a book into a coherent whole. In the words of Jan Tschichold, book design "though largely forgotten today, methods and rules upon which it is impossible to improve have been developed over centuries. To produce perfect books these rules have to be brought back to life and applied." Richard Hendel describes book design as "an arcane subject" and refers to the need for a context to understand what that means. Many different creators can contribute to book design, including [[graphic design]]ers, [[artist]]s and editors.

== Sizes ==
{{main article|Book size}}
[[File:Codex Gigas facsimile.jpg|thumb|Real-size [[facsimile]] of [[Codex Gigas]]]]
[[File:Kyauksa.JPG|thumb|A page from the [[world's largest book]]. Each page is three and a half feet wide, five feet tall and a little over five inches thick]]
The size of a modern book is based on the printing area of a common flatbed press. The pages of type were arranged and clamped in a frame, so that when printed on a sheet of paper the full size of the press, the pages would be right side up and in order when the sheet was folded, and the folded edges trimmed.

The most common book sizes are:
* Quarto (4to): the sheet of paper is folded twice, forming four leaves (eight pages) approximately 11–13&amp;nbsp;inches (c. 30&amp;nbsp;cm) tall
* Octavo (8vo): the most common size for current hardcover books. The sheet is folded three times into eight leaves (16 pages) up to 9 ¾" (c. 23 cm) tall.
* DuoDecimo (12mo): a size between 8vo and 16mo, up to 7 ¾" (c. 18&amp;nbsp;cm) tall
* Sextodecimo (16mo): the sheet is folded four times, forming 16 leaves (32 pages) up to 6 ¾" (c. 15 cm) tall

Sizes smaller than 16mo are:
* 24mo: up to 5 ¾" (c. 13&amp;nbsp;cm) tall.
* 32mo: up to 5" (c. 12&amp;nbsp;cm) tall.
* 48mo: up to 4" (c. 10&amp;nbsp;cm) tall.
* 64mo: up to 3" (c. 8&amp;nbsp;cm) tall.

Small books can be called ''booklets''.

Sizes larger than quarto are:
* Folio: up to 15" (c. 38&amp;nbsp;cm) tall.
* Elephant Folio: up to 23" (c. 58&amp;nbsp;cm) tall.
* Atlas Folio: up to 25" (c. 63&amp;nbsp;cm) tall.
* Double Elephant Folio: up to 50" (c. 127&amp;nbsp;cm) tall.

The largest extant medieval manuscript in the world is [[Codex Gigas]] 92 × 50 × 22&amp;nbsp;cm. The [[world's largest book]] is made of stone and is in [[Kuthodaw Pagoda]] ([[Burma]]).

== Types ==

=== By content ===
[[File:Polish sci fi fantasy books.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Novel]]s in a [[bookstore]]]]
A common separation by content are [[fiction]] and [[non-fiction]] books. This simple separation can be found in most [[collection (museum)|collections]], [[library|libraries]], and [[bookstore]]s.

==== Fiction ====
Many of the books published today are fiction, meaning that they are in-part or completely untrue. Historically, paper production was considered too expensive to be used for [[entertainment]]. An increase in global [[literacy]] and [[printing|print]] technology led to the increased publication of books for the purpose of entertainment, and allegorical [[social commentary]]. Most fiction is additionally categorized by [[genre]].

The '''[[novel]]''' is the most common form of fiction book. Novels are stories that typically feature a [[plot (narrative)|plot]], [[setting (fiction)|setting]], [[theme (literature)|themes]] and [[character (arts)|characters]]. Stories and narrative are not restricted to any topic; a novel can be whimsical, serious or [[controversy|controversial]]. The novel has had a tremendous impact on entertainment and [[publishing]] [[Market (economics)|markets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Media Business; Publishers Worry After Fiction Sales Weaken |author=Edwin Mcdowell |date=October 30, 1989 |work=New York Times | id = |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/30/business/the-media-business-publishers-worry-after-fiction-sales-weaken.html |accessdate =January 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[novella]] is a term sometimes used for fiction [[prose]] typically between 17,500 and 40,000 words, and a [[Novella|novelette]] between 7,500 and 17,500. A [[short story]] may be any length up to 10,000 words, but these word lengths vary.

'''[[Comic book]]s''' or '''[[graphic novel]]s''' are books in which the story is illustrated. The characters and narrators use speech or thought bubbles to express verbal language.

==== Non-fiction ====
[[File:Stefan Ramult-Pomeranian Dictionary.png|upright|thumb|left|A page from a [[dictionary]]]]
In a library, a [[reference book]] is a general type of non-fiction book which provides information as opposed to telling a story, essay, commentary, or otherwise supporting a point of view. An [[almanac]] is a very general reference book, usually one-volume, with lists of data and information on many topics. An [[encyclopedia]] is a book or set of books designed to have more in-depth articles on many topics. A book listing [[word]]s, their [[etymology]], meanings, and other information is called a [[dictionary]]. A book which is a collection of [[map]]s is an [[atlas]]. A more specific reference book with tables or lists of data and information about a certain topic, often intended for professional use, is often called a [[handbook]]. Books which try to list references and abstracts in a certain broad area may be called an [[index (publishing)|index]], such as ''Engineering Index'', or [[abstract (summary)|abstracts]] such as chemical abstracts and biological abstracts.
[[File:Atlas - book.jpg|right|thumb|An [[atlas]]]]

Books with technical information on how to do something or how to use some equipment are called [[instruction manual]]s. Other popular [[how-to]] books include [[cookbook]]s and [[home improvement]] books.

Students typically store and carry [[textbook]]s and [[schoolbooks]] for study purposes. [[Elementary school]] pupils often use [[workbook]]s, which are published with spaces or blanks to be filled by them for study or [[homework]]. In US [[higher education]], it is common for a student to take an exam using a [[blue book exam|blue book]].

[[File:Friedrich Kellner diary Oct 6, 1939 p3.jpg|left|thumb|upright|A page from a [[notebook]] used as hand written [[diary]]]]

There is a large set of books that are made only to write private ideas, notes, and accounts. These books are rarely published and are typically destroyed or remain private. [[Notebook]]s are blank papers to be written in by the user. [[Student]]s and [[writer]]s commonly use them for taking notes. [[Scientist]]s and other researchers use [[lab notebook]]s to record their notes. They often feature spiral coil bindings at the edge so that pages may easily be torn out.

[[File:MichYellowBooks.JPG|thumb|A [[telephone directory]], with business and residence listings.]]

[[Address book]]s, [[phone book]]s, and [[meeting|calendar/appointment]] books are commonly used on a daily basis for recording appointments, meetings and personal [[Address (geography)|contact information]].

Books for recording periodic entries by the user, such as daily information about a journey, are called [[logbook]]s or simply logs. A similar book for writing the owner's daily private personal events, information, and ideas is called a [[diary]] or [[personal journal]].

[[Business]]es use [[accounting]] books such as journals and [[ledger]]s to record financial data in a practice called [[bookkeeping]].

==== Other types ====
There are several other types of books which are not commonly found under this system. [[photograph album|Albums]] are books for holding a group of items belonging to a particular theme, such as a set of [[photograph]]s, card collections, and memorabilia. One common example is [[stamp album]]s, which are used by many hobbyists to protect and organize their collections of [[postage stamps]]. Such albums are often made using removable plastic pages held inside in a ringed binder or other similar holder. Picture books are books for children with pictures on every page and less text (or even no text).

[[Hymnal]]s are books with collections of [[music]]al [[hymn]]s that can typically be found in [[church (building)|churches]]. [[Breviary|Prayerbooks]] or [[missal]]s are books that contain written [[prayer]]s and are commonly carried by [[monk]]s, [[nun]]s, and other devoted followers or [[clergy]].

===Decodable readers and leveled books===
A leveled book collection is a set of books organized in levels of difficulty from the easy books appropriate for an emergent reader to longer more complex books adequate for advanced readers.  Decodable readers or books are a specialized type of leveled books that use decodable text only including controlled lists of words, sentences and stories consistent with the letters and phonics that have been taught to the emergent reader.  New sounds and letters are added to higher level decodable books, as the level of instruction progresses, allowing for higher levels of accuracy, comprehension and fluency.

=== By physical format ===
[[File:Latin dictionary.jpg|thumb|[[Hardcover]] books]]
[[File:Borders bookshelf.jpg|thumb|[[Paperback]] books]]

[[Hardcover]] books have a stiff binding. [[Paperback]] books have cheaper, flexible covers which tend to be less durable. An alternative to paperback is the glossy cover, otherwise known as a dust cover, found on magazines, and comic books. Spiral-bound books are bound by spirals made of metal or plastic. Examples of spiral-bound books include teachers' manuals and [[puzzle book]]s ([[crossword]]s, [[sudoku]]).

[[Publishing]] is a process for producing pre-printed books, [[magazines]], and newspapers for the reader/user to buy.

Publishers may produce low-cost, pre-publication copies known as [[galley proof|galleys]] or 'bound proofs' for promotional purposes, such as generating reviews in advance of publication. Galleys are usually made as cheaply as possible, since they are not intended for sale.

== Libraries ==
{{main article|Library}}
[[File:Celsus-Bibliothek2.jpg|thumb|[[Celsus Library]] was built in 135 AD and could house around 12,000 scrolls.]]
Private or personal libraries made up of non-fiction and fiction books, (as opposed to the state or institutional records kept in [[archive]]s) first appeared in [[classical Greece]]. In the ancient world, the maintaining of a [[library]] was usually (but not exclusively) the privilege of a wealthy individual. These libraries could have been either private or public, i.e. for people who were interested in using them. The difference from a modern [[public library]] lies in the fact that they were usually not funded from public sources. It is estimated that in the city of Rome at the end of the 3rd century there were around 30 public libraries. Public libraries also existed in other cities of the ancient [[History of the Mediterranean region|Mediterranean region]] (for example, [[Library of Alexandria]]).&lt;ref&gt;Miriam A. Drake, ''Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science'' (Marcel Dekker, 2003), "Public Libraries, History".&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in the Middle Ages, monasteries and universities had also libraries that could be accessible to general public. Typically not the whole collection was available to public, the books could not be borrowed and often were chained to reading stands to prevent theft.

The beginning of modern public library begins around 15th century when individuals started to donate books to towns.&lt;ref&gt;Miriam A. Drake, ''Encyclopedia of Library'', "Public Libraries, History".&lt;/ref&gt; The growth of a [[public library]] system in the United States started in the late 19th century and was much helped by donations from [[Andrew Carnegie]]. This reflected classes in a society: The poor or the middle class had to access most books through a public library or by other means while the rich could afford to have a [[private library]] built in their homes. In the United States the Boston Public Library 1852 ''Report of the Trustees'' established the justification for the public library as a tax-supported institution intended to extend educational opportunity and provide for general culture.&lt;ref&gt;McCook, Kathleen de la Peña (2011), ''Introduction to Public Librarianship'', 2nd ed., p. 23 New York, Neal-Schuman.&lt;/ref&gt;

The advent of [[paperback]] books in the 20th century led to an explosion of popular publishing. Paperback books made owning books affordable for many people. Paperback books often included works from genres that had previously been published mostly in [[pulp magazines]]. As a result of the low cost of such books and the spread of bookstores filled with them (in addition to the creation of a smaller market of extremely cheap used paperbacks) owning a private library ceased to be a status symbol for the rich.

In library and booksellers' catalogues, it is common to include an abbreviation such as "Crown 8vo" to indicate the [[paper size]] from which the book is made.

When rows of books are lined on a book holder, [[bookend]]s are sometimes needed to keep them from slanting.

== Identification and classification ==
[[File:ISBN.JPG|thumb|left|[[ISBN]] with [[barcode]]]]

During the 20th century, [[librarian]]s were concerned about keeping track of the many books being added yearly to the [[Gutenberg Galaxy]]. Through a global society called the [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions]] (IFLA), they devised a series of tools including the [[International Standard Bibliographic Description]] (ISBD). Each book is specified by an International Standard Book Number, or ISBN, which is unique to every edition of every book produced by participating publishers, worldwide. It is managed by the ISBN Society. An ISBN has four parts: the first part is the country code, the second the [[publisher]] code, and the third the title code. The last part is a [[check digit]], and can take values from 0–9 and X (10). The [[European Article Number|EAN]] [[Barcode]]s numbers for books are derived from the ISBN by prefixing 978, for [[Bookland]], and calculating a new check digit.

Commercial publishers in industrialized countries generally assign ISBNs to their books, so buyers may presume that the ISBN is part of a total international system, with no exceptions. However, many government publishers, in industrial as well as developing countries, do not participate fully in the ISBN system, and publish books which do not have ISBNs. A large or public collection requires a [[Library catalog|catalogue]]. Codes called "call numbers" relate the books to the catalogue, and determine their locations on the shelves. Call numbers are based on a [[Library classification]] system. The call number is placed on the spine of the book, normally a short distance before the bottom, and inside. Institutional or national standards, such as [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]]/[[NISO]] Z39.41 - 1997, establish the correct way to place information (such as the [[title (publishing)|title]], or the name of the author) on book spines, and on "shelvable" book-like objects, such as containers for [[DVD]]s, [[video tape]]s and [[software]].
[[File:Wien - Volkskundemuseum-Bibliothek, Bücherspeicher.JPG|thumb|Books on library shelves and call numbers visible on the spines]]

One of the earliest and most widely known systems of cataloguing books is the [[Dewey Decimal Classification|Dewey Decimal System]]. Another widely known system is the [[Library of Congress Classification]] system. Both systems are biased towards subjects which were well represented in US libraries when they were developed, and hence have problems handling new subjects, such as computing, or subjects relating to other cultures.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Information about books and authors can be stored in databases like [[online general-interest book database]]s. [[Metadata]], which means "data about data" is information about a book. Metadata about a book may include its title, ISBN or other classification number (see above), the names of contributors (author, editor, illustrator) and publisher, its date and size, the language of the text, its subject matter, etc.

=== Classification systems ===
* [[Bliss bibliographic classification]] (BC)
* [[Chinese Library Classification]] (CLC)
* [[Colon Classification]]
* [[Dewey Decimal Classification]] (DDC)
* [[Harvard-Yenching Classification]]
* [[Library of Congress Classification]] (LCC)
* [[New Classification Scheme for Chinese Libraries]]
* [[Universal Decimal Classification]] (UDC)

== Uses ==
Aside from the primary purpose of reading them, books are also used for other ends:
* A book can be an artistic artifact, a piece of art; this is sometimes known as an [[artists' book]].
* A book may be evaluated by a reader or professional writer to create a [[book review]].
* A book may be read by a group of people to use as a spark for social or academic discussion, as in a [[book discussion club|book club]].
* A book may be studied by students as the subject of a writing and analysis exercise in the form of a [[book report]].
* Books are sometimes used for their exterior appearance to [[decorative arts|decorate]] a room, such as a [[study (room)|study]].

== Book marketing ==
Once the book is published, it is put on the market by the distributors and the bookstores. Meanwhile, his promotion comes from various media reports. Book marketing is governed by the law in many states.

=== Other forms of secondary spread ===
In recent years, the book had a second life in the form of reading aloud. This is called public readings of published works, with the assistance of professional readers (often known actors) and in close collaboration with writers, publishers, booksellers, librarians, leaders of the literary world and artists.

Many individual or collective practices exist to increase the number of readers of a book. Among them:
* abandonment of books in public places, coupled or not with the use of the Internet, known as the [[bookcrossing]];
* provision of free books in third places like bars or cafes;
* itinerant or temporary libraries;
* free public libraries in the area.

=== Evolution of the book industry ===
This form of the book chain has hardly changed since the eighteenth century, and has not always been this way. Thus, the author has asserted gradually with time, and the copyright dates only from the nineteenth century. For many centuries, especially before the invention of printing, each freely copied out books that passed through his hands, adding if necessary his own comments. Similarly, bookseller and publisher jobs have emerged with the invention of printing, which made the book an industrial product, requiring structures of production and marketing.

The invention of the Internet, e-readers, tablets, and projects like Wikipedia and Gutenberg, are likely to strongly change the book industry in the years to come.

== Paper and conservation ==
{{main article|Conservation and restoration of books, manuscripts, documents and ephemera}}
[[File:La fille du Cid - Upper and lower cover and spine (c151e11).jpg|thumb|Halfbound book with [[leather]] and [[marbled paper]].]]

Paper was first made in China as early as 200 BC, and reached Europe through [[History of Islam|Muslim]] territories. At first made of rags, the [[industrial revolution]] changed paper-making practices, allowing for paper to be made out of wood pulp. Papermaking in Europe began in the 11th century, although [[vellum]] was also common there as page material up until the beginning of the 16th century, vellum being the more expensive and durable option. Printers or publishers would often issue the same publication on both materials, to cater to more than one market.

Paper made from [[wood pulp]] became popular in the early 20th century, because it was cheaper than [[linen]] or [[abaca]] cloth-based papers. Pulp-based paper made books less expensive to the general public. This paved the way for huge leaps in the rate of literacy in industrialised nations, and enabled the spread of information during the [[Second Industrial Revolution]].

Pulp paper, however, contains acid which eventually destroys the paper from within. Earlier techniques for making paper used [[limestone]] rollers, which neutralized the acid in the pulp. Books printed between 1850 and 1950 are primarily at risk; more recent books are often printed on acid-free or [[alkaline]] paper. Libraries today have to consider [[mass deacidification]] of their older collections in order to prevent decay.

Stability of the climate is critical to the long-term preservation of paper and book material.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last =Patkus | first = Beth| publication-date = 2003 | title = Assessing Preservation Needs, A Self-Survey Guide | publication-place = Andover| publisher =Northeast Document Conservation Center | postscript =&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; Good air circulation is important to keep fluctuation in climate stable. The [[HVAC]] system should be up to date and functioning efficiently. Light is detrimental to collections. Therefore, care should be given to the collections by implementing light control. General housekeeping issues can be addressed, including [[pest control]]. In addition to these helpful solutions, a library must also make an effort to be prepared if a disaster occurs, one that they cannot control. Time and effort should be given to create a concise and effective disaster plan to counteract any damage incurred through "acts of God" therefore an [[emergency management]] plan should be in place.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1619">'''Boresch III of Ossegg and Riesenburg''' (died before 1312) was a Bohemian aristocrat of the [[House of Riesenburg]].

The son of Boresch II (also ''Bohuslav II'') was a member of the regional court (''Landgericht'') in 1291. At the end of the 13th century ore mining flourished on the Riesenburg estates. On 22 March 1302 he signed a treaty with the [[abbot]] of Ossegg, wherein he agreed to share the mining profits with [[Osek Abbey]].

Following the death of [[Wenceslaus II of Bohemia|King Wenceslaus II]] and the murder of his successor, [[Wenceslaus III of Bohemia|Wenceslaus III]] one year later, a new wave of violence swept through [[Bohemia]], as the powerful princes attempted to extend their estates and wealth during the [[interregnum]]. Church assets were seized, but attempts were also made to rectify the injustices of the past.

Boresch, too, could not resist further extending his power. In 1307 he was named as the owner of [[Sayda]], this time however not as part of the Bohemian Empire but as an [[enfeoffment]] from the [[Margraviate of Meissen]].

He was only mentioned once more before his death. In the treaty documents of 1312 his name no longer appears.

After the Biennale, the shelter continued to be used as gathering place for illegal workers from the Chinese countryside, many of whom were living in nearby shelters and abandoned buildings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archdaily.com/46710/bug-dome-the-weak/ Bug Dome / the WEAK!] - Cilento , Karen '' Arch Daily'' 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

WEAK! was a collaboration of [[Hsieh Ying-chun|Hsieh Ying-Chun]], a Taiwan architectural activist specializing at collaborative  construction and sustainable construction, Roan Ching-Yueh, an architect, curator and art critic, and Marco Casagrande, a Finnish architect, founder of C-lab.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.designboom.com/architecture/weak-architects-at-shenzhen-hong-kong-biennale/ weak architect at shenzhen] - '' Designboom'' 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The WEAK! architects create their projects by recomposing existing materials with minimal effort to total impact. The 'bug dome' was constructed out of bamboo and weak concrete in the form of cement mixed with soil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://designhotpot.com/chinese-architects-rediscovering-the-tradition-of-bamboo/ Chinese architects rediscovering the tradition of bamboo - Design Hotpot&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''GeoAlliance Canada''' is a [[Umbrella organization]] founded in 2015. The organization addresses sector-wide strategic priorities by pooling the energy and resources of existing Canadian business, non-profit, academia and government organizations in the [[Geomatics]] sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geoalliance.ca/en/|website=Geoalliance Canada|publisher=Geoalliance Canada|accessdate=20 April 2015|title=GeoAlliance Canada website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:GeoAlliance Canada logo.jpg|thumb|right|GeoAlliance Canada is a new umbrella organization created to help unite the geomatics sector]]
GeoAlliance Canada was formed by the Canadian Gemoatics Community Round Table, a collaborative group of professionals from all fields of the [[Geomatics]]. The group  met regularly to consider the challenges that the industry would be facing in the upcoming years, propose solutions and strategies that could help guide the direction of the sector and strengthen it for the years to come. Seven strategy dimensions were used to create the Pan-Canadian Geomatics Strategy document with input from the [[geospatial]] community that helped the strategy development process, leading to the formation of GeoAlliance Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=CGCRT Steering Committee|title=Pan-Canadian Geomatics Strategy|url=http://geoalliance.ca/files/8414/3162/1267/Pan-Canadian-Geomatics-Community-Strategy-V-3.pdf|publisher=Canadian Geomatics Community Round Table|accessdate=21 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Chamber Tumulus''' is a large [[megalith]]ic construct found in certain early [[neolithic]] societies.  They have been uncovered along the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coastline in northern [[Europe]], in countries such as [[France]], [[Spain]], [[Portugal]] and [[Ireland]]. These megaliths have also been found in southern [[Scandinavia]], primarily in [[Skåne|Scania]] and [[Falbygden]]. In [[Denmark]] there are numerous older megaliths, less advanced that the versions elsewhere, thought to be [[monument]]s marking communal burial places.

The chamber tumuli predate the ancient [[Egyptian pyramids]], dating back to circa 6000-3000 B.C., depending on place of construction. Before the large farming reforms of the 19th century there were supposed to have been at least 10,000 of the older megaliths in Denmark. The more sophisticated later version does not appear in Denmark.

The practice of building these monuments is conjectured to have originated in Ireland or on the Atlantic coast of France where the oldest and largest versions of the monuments has been risen.

The newest of those monuments are located in Scandinavia, but pale in sophistication and complexity when compared with the megaliths along the Atlantic coast.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2713">'''Critical habitat''' is a [[habitat]] area essential to the conservation of a listed [[species]], though the area need not actually be occupied by the species at the time it is designated. This is a specific term and designation within the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Endangered Species Act]]-ESA &lt;ref&gt;(P.L. 93-205)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Designation process==
Critical habitat must be designated for all [[threatened species]] and [[endangered species]] under the Endangered Species Act, with certain specified exceptions.  Designations of critical habitats must be based on the best scientific information available and in an open public process within specific timeframes.

A critical habitat designation does not set up a preserve or refuge; it applies only when Federal funding, permits, or projects are involved. Under Section 7 of the ESA, all Federal agencies must ensure that any actions they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a listed species, or destroy or adversely modify its designated critical habitat.

==Considerations==
Before designating critical habitat, careful consideration must be given to the economic impacts, impacts on national security, and other relevant impacts of specifying any particular area as critical habitat.  An area may be excluded from critical habitat if the benefits of exclusion outweigh the benefits of designation, unless excluding the area will result in the [[extinction]] of the species concerned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwr.noaa.gov/Salmon-Habitat/Critical-Habitat/|title=ESA Critical Habitat|publisher=National Marine Fisheries Service|accessdate=2009-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical habitat requirements do not apply to citizens engaged in activities on private land that do not involve a Federal agency. However, if an activity on property&lt;!--?--&gt; property{{clarify|date=December 2017}} requires an action by a Federal agency (such as a loan, increasing irrigation flows, permits from a federal agency, etc.), then the Federal agency must ensure that the action will not adversely modify the designated critical habitat.

'''Defeatism''' is the acceptance of defeat without struggle, often with negative connotations. It can be linked to [[pessimism]] in psychology.&lt;ref&gt;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/defeatism. Retrieved 2014-03-13.&lt;/ref&gt;
==History==
The term ''defeatism'' commonly is used in politics as a descriptor for an ideological stance that considers co-operation with the opposition party. In the military context, in wartime, and especially at the front, ''defeatism'' is synonymous with [[treason]].

Under military law, a soldier can be accused of being defeatist if he refuses to fight by voicing doubt of the ideological validity of national policy; thus, existential questions such as “Is the war already lost?” and “Is the fight worth the effort?” are defeatism that connote advocacy of an alternative end-to-the war other than military victory.

During [[World War II]], [[Adolf Hitler]] unexpectedly dismissed many generals for defeatism. During the last year of war, the German [[Volksgerichtshof|people's court]] executed many people accused of defeatist talks or acts and their names were announced weekly in a pink colored poster pasted on billboards around the country.&lt;ref&gt;H.W. Koch: ''In the Name of the Volk: Political Justice in Hitler's Germany''. I.B. Tauris, 1997. {{ISBN|1860641741}} pp. 228&lt;/ref&gt;

== Revolutionary defeatism ==
[[Revolutionary defeatism]] is a related idea, made most prominent by [[Vladimir Lenin]], that establishes that the [[proletariat]] cannot win or gain in a capitalist war. Instead, according to Lenin, the true enemy of the proletariat is the imperialist leaders who send their lower classes into battle. Workers would gain more from their own nations’ defeats, he argued, if the war could be turned into civil war and then international revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Appignanesi, Richard (1977) ''Lenin For Beginners'', p. 118. Writers and Readers Cooperative, London. {{ISBN|0906386039}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9200">A '''defective script''' is a [[writing system]] that does not represent all the [[phoneme|phonemic]] distinctions of a language.&lt;ref name="Sampson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sampson|first=Geoffrey|year=1985|title=Writing Systems|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=0-8047-1756-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|36-38}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Coulmas|first=Florian|year=1996|title=The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Writing Systems|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=0-631-21481-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|118}} For example, [[Italian language|Italian]] has seven [[vowel]]s, but the [[Italian alphabet]] has only five vowel [[letter (alphabet)|letter]]s to represent them; in general, the difference between [[Vowel#height|close]] {{IPA|/e, o/}} and [[Vowel#height|open]] {{IPA|/ɛ, ɔ/}} is simply ignored, though stress marks, if used, may distinguish them. Among the [[consonant]]s, both {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/z/}} are written {{angbr|{{lang|it|s}}}}, and both {{IPA|/ts/}} and {{IPA|/dz/}} are written {{angbr|{{lang|it|z}}}}, though not many words are distinguished by the latter. [[Stress (linguistics)|Stress]] and [[hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]] are not reliably distinguished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Danesi|first=Marcel|year=1996|title=Italian the Easy way|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_RuiM7-I7ScC|isbn=9780812091465}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such shortcomings are not uncommon. The [[Greek alphabet]] was defective during its early history. [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] had distinctive [[vowel length]]: five short vowels, {{IPA|/i e a o u/}}, and seven long vowels, {{IPA|/iː eː ɛː aː ɔː oː uː/}}. When the [[Phoenician alphabet]] was adapted to Greek, the names of five letters were pronounced by the Greeks with initial consonants made silent, and were then used acrophonically to represent vowels. These were ''[[alpha (letter)|alpha]]'', ''e'' (later called ''[[epsilon|e psilon]]''), ''[[iota (letter)|iota]]'', ''o'' (later called ''[[omicron (letter)|o micron]]''), and ''u'' (later called ''[[upsilon (letter)|u psilon]]'') &amp;ndash; &lt;{{lang|grc|α, ε, ι, ο, υ}}&gt; &amp;ndash; five letters for twelve vowel sounds. Later the [h] dropped  from the Eastern Greek dialects, and the letter ''heta'' (now pronounced ''[[eta (letter)|eta]]'') became available; it was used for {{IPA|/ɛː/}}. About the same time the Greeks created an additional letter, ''[[omega (letter)|o mega]]'', probably by writing ''o micron'' with an underline, that was used for {{IPA|/ɔː/}}. [[Digraph (orthography)|Digraph]]s ''ei'' and ''ou'' were adopted for {{IPA|/eː/}} and {{IPA|/oː/.}} Thus Greek entered its classical era with seven letters and two digraphs &amp;ndash; &lt;{{lang|grc|α, ε, ι, ο, υ, η, ω, ει, ου}}&gt; &amp;ndash; for twelve vowel sounds. Long {{IPA|/iː aː uː/}} were never distinguished from short {{IPA|/i a u/}}, even though the distinction was meaningful. Although the Greek alphabet was a good match to the consonants of the language, it was defective when it came to some vowels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pierre Swiggers|editor=P.T. Daniels &amp; W. Bright|title=The World's Writing Systems|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-507993-7|chapter=Transmission of the Phoenician Script to the West}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Leslie Threatte|editor=P.T. Daniels &amp; W. Bright|title=The World's Writing Systems|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-507993-7|chapter=The Greek Alphabet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other ancient scripts were also defective. Egyptian [[hieroglyphs]] had no vowel representation at all, while the [[cuneiform script]] frequently failed to distinguish among a consonant triad like /t/, /d/ and /t'/ (emphatic /t/), or between the vowels /e/ and /i/.  

Languages with a long literary history have a tendency to freeze spelling at an early stage, leaving subsequent pronunciation shifts unrecorded.  Such is the case with English, French, Greek, Hebrew, Persian, and Thai, among others.  By contrast, some writing systems have been periodically respelled in accordance with changed pronunciation, such as Dutch, Portuguese, Spanish, Irish Gaelic, and Japanese hiragana.    

A broadly defective script is the [[Arabic abjad]].&lt;ref name="DB"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peter T. Daniels|author2=William Bright|title=The World's Writing Systems|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-507993-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|561-3}} The modern script does not normally write short vowels, but for the first few centuries of the [[Islam]]ic era, long vowels were not written and many consonant letters were ambiguous as well. The Arabic script derives from the Aramaic, and not only did the [[Aramaic language]] have fewer [[phoneme]]s than Arabic, but several originally distinct Aramaic letters had conflated (become indistinguishable in shape), so that in the early Arabic writings 28 consonant phonemes were represented by only 18 letters—and in the middle of words, only 15 were distinct. For example, medial {{angbr|{{lang|ar|ـٮـ}}}} represented {{IPA|/b, t, θ, n, j/}}, and {{angbr|{{lang|ar|ح}}}} represented {{IPA|/d͡ʒ, ħ, x/}}. A system of [[diacritic]] marks, or ''pointing,'' was later developed to resolve the ambiguities, and over the centuries became nearly universal. However, even today unpointed texts of a style called ''{{transl|ar|DIN|mašq}}'' are found, where these consonants are not distinguished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard Bell|author2=William Montgomery Watt|title=Bell's Introduction to the Qur'ān|year=1970|publisher=University Press|location=Edinburgh|isbn=978-0-85224-171-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Without short vowels or [[Gemination|geminate]] consonants being written, modern Arabic {{lang|ar|نظر}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|nẓr}}'' could represent {{lang|ar|نَظَرَ}} {{IPA|/naðˤara/}} 'he saw', {{lang|ar|نَظَّرَ}} {{IPA|/naðˤːara/}} 'he compared', {{lang|ar|نُظِرَ}} {{IPA|/nuðˤira/}} 'he was seen', {{lang|ar|نُظِّرَ}} {{IPA|/nuðˤːira/}} 'he was compared', {{lang|ar|نَظَر}} {{IPA|/naðˤar/}} 'a glance', or {{lang|ar|نِظْر}} {{IPA|/niðˤr/}} 'similar'. However, in practice there is little ambiguity, as the vowels are more easily predictable in Arabic than they are in a language like English. Moreover, the defective nature of the script has its benefits: the stable shape of the root words, despite grammatical [[inflection]], results in quicker word recognition and therefore faster reading speeds; and the lack of short vowels, the sounds which vary the most between [[Varieties of Arabic|Arabic dialects]], makes texts more widely accessible to a diverse audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Bauer|editor=P.T. Daniels &amp; W. Bright|title=The World's Writing Systems|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-507993-7|chapter=Arabic Writing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in ''{{transl|ar|DIN|mašq}}'' and those styles of ''[[kufic]]'' writing which lack consonant pointing, the ambiguities are more serious, for here different roots are written the same. {{lang|ar|ٮطر}} could represent the root ''{{transl|ar|DIN|nẓr}}'' 'see' as above, but also ''{{transl|ar|DIN|nṭr}}'' 'protect', ''{{transl|ar|DIN|bṭr}}'' 'pride', ''{{transl|ar|DIN|bẓr}}'' 'clitoris' or 'with flint', as well as several inflections and derivations of each of these root words.

The Arabic alphabet has been adopted by many Muslim peoples to write their languages.  In them, new consonant letters have been devised for sounds lacking in Arabic (e.g. {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/g/}}, {{IPA|/tʃ/}}, and {{IPA|/ʒ/}} in [[Persian language|Persian]];&lt;ref name="DB" /&gt;{{rp|747}} all the aspirate and retroflex stops in [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]]&lt;ref name="DB" /&gt;{{rp|757}}).  But rarely have the full set of vowels been represented in those new alphabets: [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] had eight vowels, but used only three letters to notate them.&lt;ref name="DB" /&gt;{{rp|758}}  However, some adaptions of the Arabic alphabet do unambiguously mark all vowels: those for [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]],&lt;ref name="DB" /&gt;{{rp|753}} [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], [[Kyrgyz alphabets|Kyrgyz]], and [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]].&lt;ref name="DB" /&gt;{{rp|748}}

When a defective script is written with diacritics or other conventions to indicate all phonemic distinctions, the result is called ''plene'' writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Werner Weinberg|title=The History of Hebrew Plene Spelling|year=1985|publisher=Hebrew Union College Press|isbn=978-0-87820-205-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Defectiveness is a [[cline (linguistics)|cline]]: the Semitic ''[[abjad]]s'' do not indicate all vowels, but there are also alphabets which mark vowels but not [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] (e.g. many [[Writing systems of Africa|African languages]]), or vowel quality but not vowel length (e.g. [[Latin spelling and pronunciation|Latin]]). Even if English orthography were regularized, the English alphabet would still be incapable of unambiguously conveying [[intonation (linguistics)|intonation]], though since this is not expected of scripts, it is not normally counted as defectiveness.&lt;ref name="Sampson" /&gt;

[[File:Eretz Israel Museum2.jpg|thumb|250px|Eretz Israel Museum]]
The '''Eretz Israel Museum''' is a historical and archeological museum in the [[Ramat Aviv]] neighborhood of [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]].

[[Image:Maurice Ascalon Menorah Pal-Bell.jpg|thumb|150px|From an exhibit of Judaica at the Eretz Israel Museum, a bronze [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]] designed by  [[Maurice Ascalon]]]]

Eretz Israel Museum, established in 1953, has a large display of archaeological, anthropological and historical artifacts organized in a series of exhibition pavilions on its grounds. Each pavilion is dedicated to a different subject: glassware, ceramics, coins, copper and more.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Travel/TelAviv/Article.aspx?id=166534 Not your average museum, [[Jerusalem Post]]]&lt;/ref&gt; The museum also has a planetarium.

The "Man and His Work" wing features live demonstrations of ancient methods of weaving, jewelry and pottery making, grain grinding and bread baking. [[Tel Quasile]], an excavation in which 12 distinct layers of culture have been uncovered, is on the grounds of the museum.
[[File:Qassila 114.jpg|thumb|150px|Amphorae discovered at Tel Quasile]]

== Nechushtan pavilion ==
Inside the pavilion, visitors find themselves in a reconstructed mine from the [[Chalcolithic]] period and the Late [[Bronze Age]], showing marks of mining tools such as stone hammers, flint blades and copper chisels.

Four smelting furnaces are on display:
* Bowl furnace from the Chalcolithic period (4th millennium BCE)
* Domed furnace of the Late Bronze Age (14th–13th centuries BCE)
* Authentic Late Bronze Age furnace (12th century BCE)
* Shaft furnace of the Iron Age (10th century BCE).

Remnants of a glass furnace from the 13th century CE were discovered alongside the [[Crusader states|Crusader]] fortress at [[Sommelaria]], north of [[Acre, Israel|Acre]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

== Midianite temple pavilion ==
In the 14th century BCE, the Egyptian pharaohs dispatched mining expeditions to [[Timna]]. Alongside expert metalsmiths from the Land of [[Midian]], they extracted copper at Timna until the early 12th century BCE. This pavilion houses a Midianite temple model. Of special interest is the copper snake with gilded head found in the shrine, perhaps pointing to the biblical [[Nehushtan]] (2 Kings 18:4) ("a brazen thing").

== Glass pavilion ==
This pavilion exhibits ancient glass vessels. The exhibition is divided into three sections, representing three eras in the history of glass production: pre-blown glass (Late [[Bronze Age]] to [[Hellenistic period]]—15th-1st centuries BCE), blown glass of the Roman and Byzantine periods (1st–7th centuries CE); and blown glass of the [[Islamic]] period (7th–15th centuries CE). Two rare vessels on display are a delicate drinking horn with two openings, known by its Greek name "[[rhyton]]", and "Ennion's Blue Jug" bearing the signature of its maker,  who lived in the first half of the 1st century CE.

== The Alexander Museum of Postal History and Philately==
[[Image:Israel Postal Mailboxes.JPG|thumb|right|A variety of mailboxes used by the Israel Postal Service over the years, on display at Eretz Israel Museum Philatelic pavilion]]
The pavilion recounts the history of [[Israel Postal Company|postal service]] in the [[Land of Israel]] from the mid-15th century until the founding of the state in 1948. On display are envelopes, letters, photographs,  posters, mailboxes and telephones, as well as a mail truck from 1949.

The philatelic wing displays valuable and rare stamps.

[[Image:ErnstBarlachYoung.jpg|thumb|The young Ernst Barlach]]

'''Ernst Barlach''' (2 January 1870 in [[Wedel]] – 24 October 1938 in [[Rostock]]) was a German [[Expressionism|expressionist]] sculptor, printmaker and writer. Although he was a supporter of the war in the years leading to [[World War I]], his participation in the war made him change his position, and he is mostly known for his sculptures protesting against the war. This created many conflicts during the rise of the [[Nazi Party]], when most of his works were confiscated as [[degenerate art]].

==Biography==

===Youth===
Barlach was born in [[Wedel]], [[Province of Schleswig-Holstein|Holstein]] as the oldest of the four sons of Johanna Luise Barlach and Dr Georg Barlach. He attended primary school in [[Ratzeburg]]. It was during this period that his father died, early in 1884. He came from a Lutheran home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artway.eu/content.php?id=1229&amp;lang=en&amp;action=show|title=ArtWay.eu|website=www.artway.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Study years===
Barlach studied from 1888 to 1891 at the Gewerbeschule [[Hamburg]]. Due to his artistic talent, he continued his studies at the ''Königliche Akademie der bildenden Künste zu Dresden'' (Royal Art School [[Dresden]]) as a student of [[Robert Diez]] between 1891 and 1895. He created his first major sculpture during this time, ''Die Krautpflückerin'' (The Herb Plucker). He continued his studies for one more year in Paris at the [[Académie Julian]], from  1895 to 1897&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/academiejulian/b-1/barlach|title=Barlach - academie julian|website=sites.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; but remained critical of the German tendency to copy the style of French artists. Nevertheless, he returned to Paris again for a few months in 1897 to undertake further studies.

===Seeking===
[[Image:Barlach Magdeburger Ehrenmal.jpg|thumb|The Magdeburger Ehrenmal (Magdeburg commemorative sculpture) (1929), which created a large controversy about Barlach's anti-war position ([[Magdeburg Cathedral]])]]

After his studies, Barlach worked for some time as a sculptor in Hamburg and [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]], working mainly in an [[Art Nouveau]] style. He produced illustrations for the Art Nouveau magazine [[Jugend]] 1897–1902, and made sculpture in a style close to Art Nouveau, including some ceramic statues. Afterwards, he also worked as a teacher at a school for ceramics. His first solo exhibition took place at the Kunstsalon Richard Mutz, Berlin, in 1904.

===Formative years===
[[File:Ernst Barlach - Desperate Dance.jpg|thumb|''Desperate Dance'', illustration for the play ''Der Arme Vetter (The Poor Cousin)'', 1919, [[Dallas Museum of Art]]]]

However, the lack of commercial success of his works depressed Barlach. To lighten up, he decided to travel for eight weeks together with his brother Nikolaus and to visit his brother Hans in Russia. This trip to Russia in 1906 was one of the greatest influences on him and his artistic style. Also during his travels in Russia his son Nikolaus was born on 20 August 1906, starting a two-year fight with the mother, Rosa Schwab, for the custody of the child, which Barlach was finally granted.

After returning from Russia, Barlach's financial situation improved considerably, as he received a fixed salary from the art dealer Paul Cassirer in exchange for his sculptures. The formative experiences in Russia and the financial security helped him to develop his own style, focusing on the faces and hands of the people in his sculptures and reducing the other parts of the figures to a minimum. He also began to make wood [[Wood carving|carvings]] and [[bronze]]s of figures swathed in heavy drapery like those in early [[Gothic art]], and in dramatic attitudes expressive of powerful emotions and a yearning for spiritual ecstasy. He also worked for the German journal ''[[Simplicissimus]]'', and started to produce some literature. His works were shown on various exhibitions. He also spent ten months in [[Florence]], Italy in 1909 and afterwards settled in 1910 in [[Güstrow]] in [[Mecklenburg]], where he spent the rest of his life.

In the years before [[World War I]], Barlach was a patriotic and enthusiastic supporter of the war, awaiting a new artistic age from the war. This support for the war can also be seen in his works, as for example the statue ''Der Rächer'' (The Avenger), from December 1914. His awaited ''new artistic age'' came for him when he volunteered to join the war between 1915 and 1916 as an infantry soldier.  After three months of service he was discharged due to a heart ailment,&lt;ref name="modlin"&gt;Modlin, Yvonne. "Barlach, Ernst" In ''The Dictionary of Art.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996.  v 3, p. 242.  {{ISBN|0-19-517068-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; returning as a [[Pacifism|pacifist]] and a staunch opponent of war. The horror of the war influenced all of his subsequent works.

===Popularity===
Barlach's fame increased after the war, and he received many awards and became a member in the prestigious ''Preußische Akademie der Künste'' ([[Prussia]]n Art Academy) in 1919 and the ''Akademie der Bildenden Künste München'' ([[Munich]] Art Academy) in 1925. Barlach rejected a number of honorary degrees and teaching positions. In 1925 he also met Bernhard and Marga Böhmer for the first time. He received the [[Kleist Prize]] for drama in 1924 for his ''Die Sündflut'' (''The Flood''), in which he projects his personal [[mysticism]] onto the story of [[Noah]] and the [[Noah's Ark|Ark]]. In 1926 he wrote ''Der blaue Boll'' (translated as ''Squire Blue Boll'' or ''Boozer Boll''), an expressionist drama in which the eponymous squire almost succeeds in seducing a down-and-out young mother, before both achieve spiritual regeneration.&lt;ref name="dramas"&gt;See Banham (1998) and Ritchie (1968).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Degenerate art===
[[File:Barlach Selbstbildnis I (1928).jpg|thumb|Ernst Barlach: Self-portrait, 1928]]
From 1928 onward Barlach also generated many anti-war sculptures based on his experiences in the war. This pacifist position went against the political trend during the rise of [[Nazism]], and he was the target of much criticism. For example, the ''Magdeburger Ehrenmal'' (Magdeburg [[cenotaph]]) was ordered by the city of [[Magdeburg]] to be a memorial of World War I, and it was expected to show heroic German soldiers fighting for their glorious country. Barlach, however, created a sculpture with three German soldiers, a fresh recruit, a young officer and an old reservist, standing in a cemetery, all bearing marks of the horror, pain and desperation of the war, flanked by a mourning war widow covering her face in despair, a skeleton wearing a German army helmet, and a civilian (the face is that of Barlach himself) with his eyes closed and blocking his ears in terror. This naturally created a controversy with the pro-war population (several nationalists and Nazis claimed that the soldiers must be foreign since true Germans would be more heroic),&lt;ref&gt;Domprediger Giselher Quast (1992); Ilona Laudan, "Ernst Barlach, Das Denkmal des Krieges in Dom zu Magdeburg"&lt;/ref&gt; and the sculpture was removed. Friends of Barlach were able to hide the sculpture until after the war, when it was returned to the [[Magdeburg Cathedral]]. Yet the attacks on Barlach continued until his death.

In 1931 Barlach started to live with Marga Böhmer, whereas her ex-husband and Barlach's friend Bernhard Böhmer lived with his new wife Hella.

In 1936, Barlach's works were confiscated during an exhibition together with the works of [[Käthe Kollwitz]] and [[Wilhelm Lehmbruck]], and the majority of his remaining works were confiscated as "[[degenerate art]]", for example the ''Güstrower Ehrenmal'' (Güstrow cenotaph) and the ''Hamburger Ehrenmal'' (Hamburg cenotaph). Barlach himself was prohibited from working as a sculptor, and his membership in the art academies was canceled. This rejection is reflected in his final works before his death from heart failure on 24 October 1938 in [[Rostock]], [[Mecklenburg]].&lt;ref name="modlin" /&gt; He is buried in the cemetery of [[Ratzeburg]].

In addition to his sculpture, Barlach also wrote eight Expressionist dramas, two novels and an autobiography ''Ein selbsterzähltes Leben'' 1928, and had a distinguished oeuvre of woodcuts and lithographs from about 1910 onwards, including illustrations for his own plays.

The '''Food Chain Workers Alliance (FCWA)''' is a national [[coalition]] of 31 worker-based organizations of workers in many sectors of the food chain, including agriculture, processing, selling, and serving.  Its program areas include strategic campaigns ,   leadership development, policy and standards, and education and communications.  FCWA members represent over 300,000 workers. The Alliance is based in Los Angeles, California, and was founded in 2009.

== History ==
Prior to 2008, a number of organizations of workers along the food chain had been struggling with ways to integrate their work with the new national interest in food systems, and some had begun talking with each other about possible ways to collaborate with each other.

In January 2008 the Restaurant Opportunities Centers United (ROC United), thanks to a suggestion from a Jessie Smith Noyes Foundation program officer, organized an initial meeting of several organizations and in May 2008 convened eight organizations at the Labor Notes Conference in Detroit. At this meeting, the groups came together to get to know each other better, to share information on their work, and to talk about the idea of collaborating with each other. These groups included ROC United, the Center for New Community, the Coalition of Immokalee Workers, el Comité de Apoyo a los Trabajadores Agrícolas, the International Labor Rights Forum, and the Northwest Arkansas Workers’ Justice Center (NWAWJC).  All the groups decided that they did indeed want to work together – the real guiding vision that everybody agreed to at that point was that all of these organizations, with their high-stakes campaign experience, their membership, and their piece of the food chain, coming together would be incredibly strategic to build real power for all the workers along the food chain.

After the Labor Notes conference through quarterly conference calls the organizations continued to share information about their own campaigns and to support each other’s campaigns whenever possible.

The groups then decided to hold an in-person retreat to talk more in-depth about what an alliance could do.  Thanks to the Restaurant Opportunities Centers United, which raised funds from the Ford Foundation, nine organizations came together in Chicago in July 2009 to officially create the Food Chain Workers Alliance.  In addition to the groups listed above, Just Harvest USA, the Restaurant Opportunities Center of New York, and the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 1500 also participated. NWAWJC could not attend but afterwards confirmed their membership in the Alliance.

At the meeting the DataCenter shared research that it had conducted on the work and the demographics of the membership of each organization and the possibility of common corporate targets among all the groups. Then the representatives of the nine organizations spent almost two days sharing experiences and talking about their vision for an alliance.  Thus the Food Chain Workers Alliance was born.

== Program areas ==
Food Chain Workers Alliance program areas: 
# Worker Leadership and Solidarity 
# Movement Building

In June 2012, the FCWA released a comprehensive report on workers in the food system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Bureau of National Affairs, Inc.|date=6 June 2012|volume=109|series=A-13|issue=418–2693|url=http://foodchainworkers.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/BNA-article.pdf|format=PDF|title=Most Food System Workers Have Low Wages, Few Benefits, Report Says}}&lt;/ref&gt; This report is called "[http://foodchainworkers.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Hands-That-Feed-Us-Report.pdf The Hands That Feed Us: Challenges and Opportunities for Workers Along the Food Chain]." 
 
The Alliance supports members’ organizing campaigns, explores potential coordinated campaigns between various members of the Alliance, and acts in solidarity with other workers’ organizations.

'''Gafsa Archaeological Museum''' is an [[archaeological museum]] in [[Gafsa]], [[Tunisia]]. It sits in the old city center. Opposite the [[museum]] are ancient [[Roman Empire|Roman]] pools.&lt;ref name="Museum of Gafsa"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Archaeological Museum of Gafsa|url=http://www.patrimoinedetunisie.com.tn/eng/musees/gafsa.php|publisher=Agency for the Development of Natural Heritage and Cultural Promotion, Republic of Tunisia|accessdate=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of Gafsa==
A large section of the museum is dedicated to the period of history of Gafsa when it was under Roman control. Gafsa was once a Roman frontier town, the headquarters of a [[garrison]]. A high-ranking military chief would usually be in command of the garrison and resided in Gafsa. Articles used in everyday life, like jewellery, coins, sculptures and mosaics, are part of this collection. One ostonef the best artifacts is the mosaic pavement that shows a circus game.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}&lt;!-- empty link&lt;ref name="Gafsa Museum"&gt;{{cite web}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; It dates from the 4th century AD.

==Exhibits==
[[File:Manor 033.jpg|thumb|Stone tools similar to those at display in the Gafsa Museum]]
The Gafsa Museum has an extensive collection of prehistoric [[flint tool|flint]] and [[Lithic technology|lithic]] tools as well as other [[bone tools|tools]] fashioned out of bone. Objects depicting human and animal figures and paraphernalia suggesting spiritual life are also part of the museum collection. The museum houses not only artifacts from the city but also from the surrounding areas.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}&lt;!-- empty link&lt;ref name="Gafsa Museum"&gt;{{cite web}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; One of the museum's most prized assets is a [[Capsian culture|Capsian]] figurine dating back to 8000 BC. This indicates that Gafsa, after which the Capsian culture was named, has been inhabited since the [[Mesolithic]] epoch.

'''Humour in Islam''', is an accepted tradition dating back to the [[Prophets of Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Khan|first1=Yasmeen|title=Does Islam have a sense of humour?|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/7102519.stm|accessdate=17 January 2017|agency=[[BBC]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=20 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Islamic sources on humour==
Laughter, fun, and joking are permissible in Islam provided guidelines from the [[Quran]] and [[ahadith]] are followed. For humor to be in accordance with Islam, the joke should not be blasphemous and should be within the limits of ''[[Adab (Islam)|adab]]'' (manners).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:Hadith imam baqir.svg|thumb|[[Muhammad al-Baqir]]'s [[Hadith]] about humour]]

===Hadiths===
1) The Prophet used to smile, rather than laugh.
[[Aisha]], wife of the Prophet Muhammad narrated:
{{Quote|"I never saw the Messenger of Allah laugh fully to such an extent that I could see his uvula. He would only smile."|[[Sunan Abu Dawood]] Volume 3, Book 41: Kitab Al-Adab (General Behavior), Hadith Number 5079;&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|abudawud|usc=yes|41|5079}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sahih al-Bukhari]], Volume 8, Book 73: Kitab Al-Adab (Good Manners and Form), Hadith Number 114.&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|8|73|114}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

2) The Prophet's smile and his companions' laughing sessions.
Jabir ibn Samurah narrated:
{{Quote|Simak ibn Harb asked Jabir ibn Samurah, "Did you sit in the company of the Messenger of Allah?" He said: Yes, very often. He (the Prophet) used to sit at the place where he observed the morning or dawn prayer till the sun rose or when it had risen; he would stand, and they (his Companions) would talk about matters (pertaining to the days) of ignorance, and they would laugh (on these matters) while (the Prophet) only smiled.|[[Sahih Muslim]], Book 4: Kitab Al-Salat (Book of Prayers), Chapter 92, Hadith Number 1413.&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|muslim|usc=yes|4|1413}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

3) Aisha also narrated:
{{Quote|The Prophet in his fatal illness, called his daughter Fatima and told her a secret because of which she started weeping. Then he called her and told her another secret, and she started laughing. When I asked her about that, she replied, "The Prophet told me that he would die in his fatal illness, and so I wept, but then he secretly told me that from amongst his family, I would be the first to join him, and so I laughed."|[[Sahih Muslim]], Volume 4, Book 56: (Virtues and Merits of the Prophet and his Companions), Hadith Number 819.&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|muslim|usc=yes|56|819}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

4) The Prophet encouraged to be jestful with your family.
[[Abdullah, son of Masud|Ibn Mas'ud]] narrated that the Prophet Muhammad said;
{{Quote|"Mix with the people on the condition that your [[Din (Arabic)|Deen]] is not jeopardized, and be jestful with the family."|[[Sahih al-Bukhari]], Chapter 81: To be cheerful with the people.&lt;ref name="islamicity"&gt;{{cite news |last=Farooq|first=Mohammad Omar|url=http://www.islamicity.com/articles/Articles.asp?ref=IC0806-3605|title=The Lighter Side in Hadith|publisher=IslamiCity.Com|date=June 3, 2011|accessdate=February 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="globalwebpost"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalwebpost.com/farooqm/hadith_humor/hadith_laugh.html|title=Hadith Humor collection|publisher=globalwebpost|date=|accessdate=March 1, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121123021436/http://www.globalwebpost.com/farooqm/hadith_humor/hadith_laugh.html|archivedate=November 23, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

5) [[Abu Dharr al-Ghifari]] narrated that the Prophet Muhammad said;
{{Quote|"...I indeed saw the Messenger of Allah laugh till his front teeth were exposed."|[[Sahih Muslim]], Book 1: Kitab Al-Iman (The Book of Faith), Chapter 83, Hadith Number 365.&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|muslim|usc=yes|1|365}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

6) The Prophet discouraged laughing at inappropriate times.
[[Al-Aswad ibn Yazid]] narrated:
{{Quote|Some young men from the Quraish visited Aisha as she was in Mina and they were laughing. She said: "What makes you laugh?” They said: Such and such person stumbled against the rope of the tent and he was about to break his neck or lose his eyes. She said: “Don’t laugh for I heard Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: If a Muslim runs a thorn or (gets into trouble) severe than this, there is assured for him (a higher) rank and his sins are obliterated."|[[Sahih Muslim]], Book 32: Kitab Al-Birr was-Salat-I-wa'l-Adab (The Book of Virtue, Good Manners and Joining of the Ties of Relationship), Chapter 12, Hadith Number 6237.&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|muslim|usc=yes|32|6237}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

7) The Prophet encouraged jokes about the truth.
[[Abu Hurairah]] narrated that;
{{Quote|When some of his companions said to Prophet Muhammad: "O Prophet Muhammad, yet, you also joke with us!" He replied: "Yes, I do. But I only tell the truth."|[[at-Tirmidhi]].&lt;ref name="lastprophet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lastprophet.info/jokes-and-humor-of-prophet-muhammad|title=Jokes and Humor of Prophet Muhammad|publisher=Last Prophet|date=March 5, 2010|accessdate=February 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Prophet Muhammad said:
{{Quote|"A man may say something to make his companions laugh, and he will fall into Hell as far as the Pleiades because of it."|[[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]].&lt;ref name="islamqa1"&gt;{{cite web |last=al-Qaasim|first=‘Abd al-Malik|url=http://islamqa.info/en/ref/22170|title=Conditions of permissible joking|publisher=Islam Question and Answer|date= |accessdate=April 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="islamqa2"&gt;{{cite news |last=al-Qaasim|first=‘Abd al-Malik|url=http://islamqa.info/en/ref/22170|title=What are the conditions for joking to be permissible? |publisher=Islam Question and Answer|date= |accessdate=April 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

8) The Prophet discouraged lying to make people laugh&lt;ref name="productivemuslim"/&gt;

{{Quote|"Woe to the one who speaks and tells lies in order to make the people laugh; woe to him, woe to him."|[[at-Tirmidhi]], Hadith Number 2315; [[Sunan Abu Dawood]], Hadith Number 4990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|abudawud|usc=yes|41|4990}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="islamqa3"&gt;{{cite news |last=Al-Munahhid|first=Muhammad S|url=http://islamqa.info/en/ref/161701|title=Ruling on creating a humour application for Facebook|location= |work= |publisher=Islam Question and Answer|date= |accessdate=March 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

9) The Prophet discouraged frightening anyone as a joke.

{{Quote|Once when travelling, one of the sahabah fell asleep, the others got some rope and tied him up.  The man woke up and was frightened so Prophet Muhammad said: "It is not lawful to any Muslim to frighten another Muslim."|[[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani|Ibn Hajar]]; [[Sunan Abu Dawood]].&lt;ref name="productivemuslim"&gt;{{cite news |last=El-Shaf’ei|first=Ahmad|url=http://productivemuslim.com/sense-of-humour-in-islam/|title=Sense of Humour in Islam|location= |work= |publisher=''Productive Muslim''|date=April 28, 2011|accessdate=February 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

10) The Prophet discouraged joking or laughing excessively.&lt;ref name="zarch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zarch-1.webs.com/ruleofjoke.htm|title=Rule of joke|publisher=Fukaaha|date=|accessdate=April 2, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140123033445/http://zarch-1.webs.com/ruleofjoke.htm|archivedate=January 23, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prophet Muhammad said:
{{Quote|"Do not laugh too much, for laughing too much deadens the heart."|Saheeh al-Jaami’, 7312; [[Muhammad ibn `Isa at-Tirmidhi|al-Tirmidhi]], 2305; [[Ibn Majah]], 4193}}Muhammad discouraged backbiting and inappropriate language:{{Quote|"(Backbiting is) your mentioning about your brother something that he dislikes."|[[Sahih Muslim]], Book 32: (The Book of Virtue, Good Manners and Joining of the Ties of Relationship), Chapter 18, Hadith Number 6265.&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|muslim|usc=yes|32|6265}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{Quote|"The Muslim does not slander, curse, speak obscenely or speak rudely."|[[Muhammad ibn `Isa at-Tirmidhi|Tirmidhi]]&lt;ref name="lutonmuslims"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lutonmuslims.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=277:jokingetiquette&amp;catid=43:justdoit&amp;Itemid=63|title=Etiquettes of joking|publisher=Luton Muslims|date=|accessdate=April 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
====Jokes of Muhammad====
[[Muhammad]] is reported by [[Tirmidhi]] to have said: "Why are there no old women in heaven? Because they become young girls when they get there."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite news|title=Two mullahs went into a bar…|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21540233|accessdate=26 January 2017|agency=[[The Economist]]|publisher=[[The Economist]]|date=26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Other instances include man who came up to Muhammad to ask him to give him a beast to ride. The Prophet jokingly told him, "I will give you the offspring of a she-camel to ride." He said, "O Messenger of Allah , what will I do with the offspring of a she-camel?" The Prophet said: "Are riding-camels born except from she-camels?" (Reported by [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]], [[Abu Dawud]] and al-Tirmidhi, as [[Sahih]]).&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Prophet's Sense of Humour|url=http://turntoislam.com/community/threads/the-prophets-sense-of-humour.16680/|website=TurnToIslam|publisher=TurnToIslam|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Companions ===
The [[Sahabah|Prophet’s companions]] would limit jokes, joke at appropriate times, and be cautious of joking.

[[Umar|Umar ibn al-Khattab]] narrated that;

===Quran===
{{Quote|"That it is He Who granteth Laughter and Tears."|Qur'an, chapter 53 ([[An-Najm]]), Verse 43.&lt;ref&gt;{{Quran-usc|53|43|q=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Quote|"If thou dost question them, they declare (with emphasis): 'We were only talking idly and in play.' Say: 'Was it at Allah, and His Signs, and His Messenger, that ye were mocking?' Make ye no excuses: ye have rejected Faith after ye had accepted it.

==Classical treatise==
Al Jihaz wrote a ‘Treatise on seriousness and playfulness.’ [[Ibn Qutaybah]] observed that early Muslims did not dislike joking. Writing in his ''Akhbar al hamqa'' ("History of Fools") the classical scholar [[Ibn al-Jawzi]] commented, "Humor serves as a much needed natural relaxation, and is approved for this purpose by many statements of Prophet Muhammad and the early Muslims."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC Comedy Sketch ‘Real Housewives of ISIS’ – A Muslim View|url=http://aboutislam.net/family-society/culture/bbc-comedy-sketch-real-housewives-of-isis-a-muslim-view/|website=About Islam|publisher=About Islam|accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent trends==

=== Acceptance ===
Since [[9/11]], there has been an increase in the number of Muslim comedians and humor festivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Warning: Muslims have a sense of humour and we'll be using it|url=http://www.thenational.ae/arts-life/comment/warning-muslims-have-a-sense-of-humour-and-well-be-using-it|accessdate=17 January 2017|publisher=The National|date=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent Muslim comedians include [[Azhar Usman]], [[Ahmed Ahmed]], and [[Dean Obeidallah]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Azhar Usman blames the media for misrepresenting humor in Islam. "The fact is that within Muslim culture there is a strong tradition of storytelling, joking and laughing. The relationship between Islam and comedy goes to the roots of the religion."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, American comedian [[Mohammed Amer]] asserts that it is  Muslims who have made a “terrible job” of communicating with the outside world.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 2017, in response to the "[[Real Housewives of ISIS]]", a parody of "[[Real Housewives]]" broadcast by [[BBC2]] show [[Revolting (TV series)|Revolting]], there was widespread outrage and hilarity on the idea on [[Facebook]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dhunna|first1=Asad|title=As A Muslim Should I Be Offended By ‘Real Housewives Of Isis’?|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/asad-dhunna/real-housewives-of-isis_b_13996890.html|accessdate=17 January 2017|work=Opinion|agency=[[Huffington Post]]|publisher=[[Huffington Post]]|date=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Imre Kertész''' ({{IPA-hu|ˈimrɛ ˈkɛrteːs|lang}}; 9 November 1929{{snd}}31 March 2016) was a [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] author and recipient of the 2002 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], "for writing that upholds the fragile experience of the individual against the barbaric arbitrariness of history".&lt;ref name=nobel&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/2002/press.html|title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 2002 – Imre Kertész|work=Nobelprize.org|accessdate=9 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first Hungarian to win the Nobel in Literature. His works deal with themes of [[The Holocaust|Nazi Holocaust]] (he was a survivor of a German concentration camp), dictatorship and personal freedom.&lt;ref name="Seattletimes" /&gt; He died on 31 March 2016, aged 86, at his home in Budapest  after suffering from [[Parkinson's disease]] for several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Imre Kertész gestorben|url=https://www.tagesschau.de/kultur/kertesz-gestorben-101.html|publisher=''Tagesschau''|accessdate=31 March 2016|language=German|date=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George Gomori, "[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/31/imre-kertesz-obituary Imre Kertész obituary]"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and work ==
Kertész was born in Budapest, Hungary, on 9 November 1929, the son of Aranka Jakab and László Kertész,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hermann|first1=Péter|last2=Pásztor|first2=Antal|title=Magyar és nemzetközi ki kicsoda, 1994|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B6JmAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Aranka+Jakab+Laszlo+Kert%C3%A9sz&amp;dq=Aranka+Jakab+Laszlo+Kert%C3%A9sz&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwir8p_4wurLAhWrtIMKHYsgCyMQ6AEIFjAB|accessdate=31 March 2016|language=Hungarian}}&lt;/ref&gt; a bourgeois Jewish couple. After his parents separated when he was around the age of five, Kertész attended a boarding school and, in 1940, he started secondary school where he was put into a special class for Jewish students.&lt;ref name=tagesschau&gt;{{cite web|title=Literaturnobelpreisträger Kertész gestorben: Der Retter seiner Seele|url=https://www.tagesschau.de/kultur/kertesz-gestorben-103.html|publisher=Tagesschau|accessdate=31 March 2016|language=German|date=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War II]], Kertész was deported in 1944 at the age of 14 with other [[List of Hungarian Jews|Hungarian Jews]] to the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]], and was later sent to [[Buchenwald]].&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt; Upon his arrival at the camps, Kertész claimed to be a 16-year old worker, thus saving him from the instant extermination that awaited a 14-year old.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kandell|first1=Jonathan|title=Imre Kertesz, Nobel Laureate Who Survived Holocaust, Dies at 86|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/01/world/europe/imre-kertesz-dies.html|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|accessdate=31 March 2016|date=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his camp was liberated in 1945, Kertész returned to Budapest,&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; graduated from high school in 1948,&lt;ref name="mandinerdeath"&gt;{{cite web|title=Elhunyt Kertész Imre|trans-title=Imre Kertész has died|url=http://mandiner.hu/cikk/20160331_elhunyt_kertesz_imre|website=Mandiner|language=Hungarian|accessdate=31 March 2016|date=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then went on to find work as a journalist and translator. In 1951, he lost his job at the journal ''Világosság'' (Clarity) after the publication started leaning towards communism.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; For a short term he worked as a factory worker and then in the press department of the Ministry of Heavy Industry.&lt;ref name="Guardian obituary"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/31/imre-kertesz-obituary | title=Imre Kertész obituary | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=31 March 2016 | accessdate=1 April 2016 | author=George Gomori}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1953 he started freelance journalism and translated various works into Hungarian, including [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and [[Elias Canetti]].&lt;ref name="Seattletimes" /&gt;

His best-known work, ''[[Fatelessness]]'' (''Sorstalanság''), describes the experience of 15-year-old György (George) Köves in the concentration camps of Auschwitz, Buchenwald and [[Zeitz]]. Written between 1960 and 1973, the novel was initially rejected for publication by the Communist regime in Hungary, but was published in 1975.&lt;ref name="Seattletimes" /&gt; Some have interpreted the book as quasi-autobiographical, but the author disavows a strong biographical connection. The book would go on to become part of many high school curriculums in Hungary.&lt;ref name="Seattletimes" /&gt; In 2005, a [[Fateless (film)|film based on the novel]], for which he wrote the script, was made in Hungary.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|first=Alan|last=Riding|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/03/movies/MoviesFeatures/03fate.html|title=The Holocaust, From a Teenage View|work=The New York Times|date=3 January 2006|accessdate=8 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although sharing the same title, some reviews noted that the film was more autobiographical than the novel on which it was based. It was released internationally at various dates in 2005 and 2006.

Following on from ''Fatelessness'', Kertész's ''Fiasco'' (1988) and ''[[Kaddish for an Unborn Child]]'' (1990) are, respectively, the second and third parts of his holocaust trilogy.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/31/imre-kertesz-holocaust-survivor-nobel-laureate-novelist-dies | title=Imre Kertész, Holocaust survivor and Nobel laureate, dies at 86 | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=31 March 2016 | accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His writings translated into English include ''Kaddish for an Unborn Child'' (''Kaddis a meg nem született gyermekért'') and ''Liquidation'' (''Felszámolás''), the latter set during the period of Hungary's evolution into a democracy from communist rule.&lt;ref name="Seattletimes" /&gt;

From the beginning, Kertész found little appreciation for his writing in Hungary,&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt; and he moved to Germany where he received more active support from publishers and reviewers, along with more appreciative readers. After his move, he continued translating German works into Hungarian,&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9395919/Imre-Kertesz|title=Imre Kertész|publisher=''Encyclopædia Britannica''|accessdate=9 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; notably ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]'', the plays of [[Dürrenmatt]], [[Schnitzler]] and [[Tankred Dorst]], and various thoughts and aphorisms of [[Wittgenstein]]. Kertész also continued working at his craft, writing his fiction in Hungarian, but did not publish another novel until the late 1980s.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; But from that point on, he submitted his work to publishers in Hungary until his death in March 2016. Grateful that he had found his most significant success as a writer and artist in Germany, Kertész left his [[Abatement of debts and legacies|abatement]] to the [[Academy of Arts, Berlin|Academy of Arts]] in Berlin.&lt;ref name=tagesschau/&gt;

In November 2013, Kertész underwent a successful surgery on his right hip after falling down in his home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.politics.hu/20131122/kertesz-undergoes-surgery/ | title=Kertész undergoes surgery | work=Politics.hu | date=22 November 2013 | accessdate=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he continued to deal with various health concerns during the last few years of his life. He'd recently been diagnosed with [[Parkinson's disease]], and he was again suffering from [[Depression (mood)|depression]], reported to have been a recurring battle in his own life. In fact, Kertész had struggled with this same issue through his art, as the main character of his 2003 book ''Felszámolás'' (''Liquidation'') commits suicide after struggling with depression.&lt;ref name="Guardian obituary" /&gt;

Kertész died in Budapest on 31 March 2016 at the age of 86.&lt;ref name="Seattletimes"&gt;{{cite news|title=Nobel literature laureate Imre Kertesz dies at 86|author=Pablo Gorondi|agency=Associated Press|via=''The Seattle Times''|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/nobel-literature-laureate-imre-kertesz-dies-at-86/|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
Kertész was a controversial figure within Hungary, especially since being Hungary's first and only [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Laureate in Literature]], he still lived in Germany. This tension was exacerbated by a 2009 interview with ''[[Die Welt]]'', in which Kertész vowed himself a "[[Berlin]]er" and called Budapest "completely balkanized."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kertészkedés|url=http://hangorienidiocc.blog.hu/2009/11/08/kerteszkedes_5|accessdate=11 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Krause|first1=Tilman|title=Ich schreibe keine Holocaust-Literatur, ich schreibe Romane|url=https://www.welt.de/welt_print/kultur/literatur/article5116030/Ich-schreibe-keine-Holocaust-Literatur-ich-schreibe-Romane.html|publisher=''[[Die Welt]]''|accessdate=31 March 2016|language=German|date=7 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Hungarian newspapers reacted negatively to this statement, claiming it to be hypocritical. Other critics viewed the Budapest comment ironically, saying it represented "a grudge policy that is painfully and unmistakably, characteristically Hungarian."&lt;ref name="Hungarian Literature Online"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kertész birthday interview causes controversy|url=http://www.hlo.hu/news/kertesz_birthday_interview_causes_controversy|publisher=Hungarian Literature Online|accessdate=11 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kertész later clarified in a [[Duna TV]] interview that he had intended his comment to be "constructive" and called Hungary "his homeland."&lt;ref name="Hungarian Literature Online" /&gt;

Also controversial was Kertész's criticism of [[Steven Spielberg]]'s depiction of the Holocaust in the 1993 film ''[[Schindler's List]]'' as [[kitsch]], saying: "I regard as kitsch any representation of the Holocaust that is incapable of understanding or unwilling to understand the organic connection between our own deformed mode of life and the very possibility of the Holocaust."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/holocaust/reflections.htm|title=Holocaust Reflections|publisher=English.illinois.edu|accessdate=31 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014 Kertész was the subject of an interview with ''[[The New York Times]]''. Kertész claimed the reporter was expecting him to question Hungary's democratic values and was shocked to hear Kertész say that "the situation in Hungary is nice, I'm having a great time". According to Kertész, "he didn't like my answer. His purpose must have been to make me call Hungary a dictatorship which it isn't. In the end the interview was never published".&lt;ref name="Hungarian Literature Online2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Elhallgatta a New York Times Kertész Imre véleményét|trans-title=The New York Times has kept back the opinion of Imre Kertész|url=http://mandiner.hu/cikk/20141111_elhallgatta_a_new_york_times_kertesz_imre_velemenyet|website=Mandiner|language=Hungarian|date=11 November 2014|accessdate=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Inscriptiones Graecae''''' ('''IG'''), [[Latin language|Latin]] for ''Greek inscriptions'', is an academic project originally begun by the [[Prussian Academy of Science]], and today continued by its successor organisation, the ''Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften''. Its aim is to collect and publish all known [[ancient]] [[inscriptions]] from the mainland and islands of [[Greece]].

The project was designed as a continuation of the ''Corpus Inscriptionum Graecarum'' (''Corpus of Greek Inscriptions'', abbreviated CIG) published by [[August Böckh]] between 1825 and 1860, and as a parallel to the ''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum]]'' (''Corpus of Latin Inscriptions'') founded by [[Theodor Mommsen]] in 1847. From 1860 to 1902, it was directed by [[Adolf Kirchhoff]]. From 1902 to 1931, [[Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff]] was in control of the project; he reorganised and re-energised the IG, turning it into one of the most important series for the publication of source material in [[Classical studies]].

After the [[World War II|Second World War]], the project suffered from a lack of financial and motivational support. It came to a temporary halt in 1972, but was revived by the newly reformed Berlin-Brandenburg Academy in 1994.

So far, 49 [[fascicle (book)|fascicle]]s have been published, some of them in several editions. The preparation of individual volumes is partially entrusted to external scholars, in which case the Berlin Academy retains the final [[editing]]. The Academy also maintains a collection of [[squeeze (copying method)|"squeezes"]] (paper copies) of Greek inscriptions. The project is currently directed by [[Peter Funke]]. Editors of previous volumes include [[Wilhelm Dittenberger]], [[Friedrich Hiller von Gaertringen]], [[Johannes Kirchner]] and [[Günther Klaffenbach]].

All editorial texts are published in [[Latin language|Latin]], a fact that is occasionally criticised in view of the decreasing use of that language and the extra effort required from editors. The inscriptions were published without translation, but [[German language|German]] translations for all volumes since 2012 are available on the IG website.

'''Promundo''' is a [[Brazil]]ian-based, non-governmental organization with offices in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil, [[Goma]], Democratic Republic of the Congo, and [[Washington, DC]], USA, that work in collaboration to promote caring, non-violent and equitable [[masculinities]] and gender relations in Brazil and internationally. Promundo's work engages women, girls, boys and men; strives to transform [[gender norms]] and power relations within key institutions; and is based on building local and international partnerships.  It is an [[applied research]] institute that works to test, evaluate and advocate for policies and programs that transform masculinities.

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2012}}
Founded in 1997, Promundo was born out of frustration with the prevailing discourses about [[gender equality]] and efforts to put those discourses into action, practice and [[policy]]. The institute has concentrated on developing evaluated interventions and advocacy strategies to achieve gender equality with a focus on engaging men and boys in changing inequitable and violent forms of masculinities.
 
Promundo works locally, nationally, and internationally to:
*Conduct research to build the knowledge base on masculinities and gender equality;
*Develop, evaluate and scale up gender transformative interventions and policies;
*Carry out national and international advocacy to achieve gender equality and social justice.

Promundo designs, implements, and evaluates its research and evidence-based programs in close partnership with local, not-for-profit [[Civil society|Civil Society Organizations]]. In recent years, Promundo has been increasingly recognized for promoting the role of men and boys in achieving gender equality. Most recently, Promundo expanded its presence to Washington, DC, to support the organization’s international communication, advocacy and technical assistance, which include the coordination of the [http://www.menengage.org/ MenEngage Alliance], a global network of NGOs and UN partners working to engage men and boys in gender equality, of which Promundo was a co-founder.

==Main Programs and Activities==

===Program H===
In 1999 Promundo, together with [http://www.ecos.org.br/index2.asp ECOS Comunicação em Sexualidade] ([[São Paulo]], Brazil), [http://www.papai.org.br/ Instituto Papai] ([[Recife]], Brazil), and [http://www.saludygenero.org.mx/ Salud y Género] ([[Mexico]]), with support from the [[Pan American Health Organization|Pan American Health Organization (PAHO)]], the [[World Health Organization|World Health Organization (WHO)]], [http://www.ippfwhr.org/ International Planned Parenthood Federation/Western Hemisphere Region (IPPF/WHR)], [http://www.johnsnow.com.br/ JohnSnowBrasil] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20110804001045/http://www.rb.com/home Durex – SSL International] developed the Program H (H for {{lang-pt|Homens}} and {{lang-es|Hombres}}, the words for Men).&lt;ref name="Programs H and M"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.promundo.org.br/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/OPASINGLES_WEB.pdf | title=Program H and Program M: Engaging Young Men and Empowering Young Women to Promote Gender Equality and Health | publisher=Promundo | date=October 2010 | accessdate=July 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The material was born in part of extensive community-based research, including the study ''Dying to be Men: Youth, Masculinity and Social Exclusion''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dying To Be Men: Youth, Masculinity and Social Exclusion |last=Barker |first=Gary Thomas |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2005 |publisher=Routledge, Taylor &amp; Francis |location=Abingdon, New York |isbn=0-415-33774-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Program H seeks to engage young men and their communities in critical reflections about rigid norms related to manhood.  It includes group educational activities, community campaigns, and an innovative evaluation model, called Gender-Equitable Men or GEM scale,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=http://www.promundo.org.br/en/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Evolving-Men-IMAGES-1.pdf | first1=Gary | last1=Barker | authorlink= | first2= | last2=et alii | title=Evolving Men: Initial Results from the International Men and Gender Equality Survey (IMAGES) | edição= | place=Washington, D.C. and Rio de Janeiro | publisher=International Center for Research on Women (ICRW) and Instituto Promundo | editor= | year=2011 | pages= | volume= | page= | chapter= | isbn= | accessdate=October 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; for assessing the program’s impact on gender-related attitudes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Pulerwitz | first1=Julie | last2=Barker | first2=Gary | date=April 2008 | title=Measuring Attitudes toward Gender Norms among Young Men in Brazil: Development and Psychometric Evaluation of the GEM Scale | journal=Men and Masculinities | volume=10 | issue=3 | pages=322–338 | publisher=Sage Publications | doi= 10.1177/1097184x06298778| url=http://promundo.org.br/en/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/04.pdf | issn=1097-184X | accessdate=July 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The approach was subjected to quasi-experimental impact evaluation studies in Brazil, [[India]], [[Balkans|the Balkans]] and several settings in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Barker | first1=Gary | authorlink= | last2=Ricardo | first2=Christine | date=June 2005 | title=Young Men and the Construction of Masculinity in Sub-Saharan Africa: Implications for HIV/AIDS, Conflict, and Violence | journal=Social Development Papers | volume= | issue=26 | pages= | publisher=The World Bank | place=Washington, D.C. | issn= | url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2005/06/23/000012009_20050623134235/Rendered/PDF/327120rev0PAPER0AFR0young0men0WP26.pdf | accessdate=October 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and found to lead to significant changes in attitudes among young men, in addition to self-reported increases in condom use, increased in couple communication and reductions in men’s reports of use of violence against female partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iOTzpHXgIo4C&amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=sandy+ruxton+gender+equality+and+men&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=c5aLKM6qfY&amp;sig=b3t-zZil6dns-NxN-TYjtdssfwo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6nioTq2hMI7NtgehhcEM&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | first1=Gary | last1=Barker |authorlink= | first2= | last2=et alii | title=Gender Equality and Men: Learning from Practice | place=Oxford | publisher=Oxfam | editor1-first=Sandy | editor1-last=Ruxton | year=2004 | pages=147–161 | chapter=How Do We Know If We Have Changed?

===Program M===
In 1999 Promundo in partnership with [http://www.ecos.org.br/index2.asp Ecos] (São Paulo), Instituto Papai (Recife), Salud y Género (Mexico) and [http://www.worlded.org/WEIInternet/ World Education] (United States), with the support of the [http://www.oakfnd.org/ Oak Foundation], the [http://www.macfound.org/site/c.lkLXJ8MQKrH/b.3599935/k.1648/John_D__Catherine_T_MacArthur_Foundation.htm MacArthur Foundation], the [http://www.nikefoundation.org/ Nike Foundation] and the [http://www.sepm.gov.br/ Brazilian Secretariat for Women’s Policies] developed Program M (M for {{lang-pt|Mulheres}} and {{lang-es|Mujeres}}, the words for Women).&lt;ref name="Programs H and M"/&gt;

Program M seeks to promote the health and empowerment of young women through critical reflections about gender, rights and health. It consists of educational workshops, community campaigns and innovative evaluation instruments for assessing the program’s impact on young women’s gender-related attitudes and perceived self-efficacy in interpersonal relationships.

===White Ribbon Campaign===
In 2000 Promundo, Instituto Papai and other partner organizations launched the [[White Ribbon Campaign]] in Brazil. Promundo also works together [http://www.noos.org.br/portal/index.php Instituto Noos] and the [http://www.rj.gov.br/web/guest;jsessionid=9E5B7AACE66D1FBCB1A9B1E678098122.lportal3 State Government of Rio de Janeiro] to start one of Brazil’s first batterer intervention programs, which eventually inspired the Brazilian Federal Government to implement such programs in other states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people= | date=October 22, 2011 |title=A cada hora, cem mulheres são agredidas | url=http://www.band.com.br/jornaldaband/conteudo.asp?ID=100000463790 |format= |medium=Television production |language=Portuguese |trans-title=| publisher=Jornal da Band | location=Rio de Janeiro, Brazil | accessdate=November 7, 2011 | time= | id= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Video Against Homophobia===
Because attitudes towards homophobia showed the least amount of attitude change in the study impact evaluation in Brazil, in 2005 Promundo, Ecos, Salud y Género, Papai and the other Program H partners, with support from the [http://www.aids.gov.br/ Brazilian National AIDS Programme], developed a cartoon video called ''Afraid of What?''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people= |date=2005 |title=Medo de quê? |url=http://www.promundo.org.br/audiovisuais/para-jovens-e-adultos/dvd-medo-de-que/ |format=VHS, DVD |medium=cartoon |language= |trans-title=Afraid of What? |publisher=Promundo |location=Brazil |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101007172851/http://www.promundo.org.br/audiovisuais/para-jovens-e-adultos/dvd-medo-de-que/|archivedate=2010-10-07|accessdate=July 22, 2011 |time= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |dead-url=yes|ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a complementary educational tool focusing specifically on the issue of homophobia, and targeting mostly heterosexual youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.promundo.org.br/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Guia-medo-dvd-ingles.pdf | title=Afraid of What? | publisher=Promundo | accessdate=July 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global Symposium on Engaging Men and Boys in Gender Equality===
Between March 30 and April 3, 2009, Promundo and partners co-hosted the ''Global Symposium on Engaging Men and Boys in Gender Equality'' in Rio de Janeiro. The event brought together 439 activists, researchers, and practitioners from 77 countries to share their experiences in challenging rigid gender norms and engaging men and boys in: reducing violence against women and girls; promoting sexual and reproductive health; HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment; and fatherhood and care-giving. The event was organized in collaboration with the MenEngage Alliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=

[[File:Ingres coronation charles vii.jpg|thumb|280px]]
'''''Joan of Arc at the Coronation of Charles VII''''' (French: ''Jeanne d’Arc au sacre du roi Charles VII'') is an 1854 painting by [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres]]. It is now in the [[Louvre Museum]] in [[Paris]].

The work merges the style of Ingres' teacher [[Jacques-Louis David]] with that of the [[troubador style]].&lt;ref name= PC&gt;Patricia Fride R. Carrassat and Isabelle Marcadé, ''Movimientos de la pintura'', Spes Editorial, S.L., 2004, p. 47, {{ISBN|84-8332-596-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began with a nude model, adding the clothes and armour.&lt;ref name= CA&gt;P. F. R. Carrassat, ''Maestros de la pintura'', Spes Editorial, S.L., 2005. {{ISBN|84-8332-597-7}}, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting was first commissioned by the director of the Academie des Belles Artes in [[Orléans]] to commemorate [[Joan of Arc]].&lt;ref name= BE&gt;Bárbara Eschenburg and Ingeborg Güssow, "El Romanticismo y el Realismo" in ''Los maestros de la pintura occidental'', Taschen, 2005, p. 428, {{ISBN|3-8228-4744-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; It shows her at the coronation of [[Charles VII of France]] in [[Reims Cathedral]], victorious and looking up to heaven, which she felt had given France the victory. To her right are three pages, the monk Jean Paquerel, and a servant. The servant is a self-portrait of the artist.&lt;ref name= BE /&gt; The scene is marked by ambient light, sumptuous objects and rich colours.&lt;ref name= BE /&gt;

[[File:Kaliningrad 05-2017 img18 Kings Gate.jpg|thumb|300px|The King's Gate in 2017.]]
The '''King's Gate''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: ''Королевские ворота'', [[romanization of Russian|tr.]]: ''Korolevskie vorota'', [[German language|German]]: ''Königstor'') is one of the former six gates that were built during the 19th century around [[Kaliningrad]] (the former German city of [[Königsberg]]).

The King's Gate was originally the [[Gusev, Kaliningrad Oblast|Gumbinnen]] Gate (German: ''Gumbinner Tor''), built in 1765 at the edge of the district [[Neue Sorge]]. In 1811 it was renamed the King's Gate and was the terminus of the Königstraße boulevard. The gate was redesigned by [[Friedrich August Stüler]] in 1850. The west facade has three sandstone statues, made by sculptor [[Wilhelm Stürmer]]: nine metres above the ground to the left the [[Bohemia]]n king [[Ottokar II of Bohemia|Ottokar II]] is depicted, who was Königsberg's namesake. [[Frederick I of Prussia]], Prussia's first king, follows as the middle statue. To the right [[Albert, Duke of Prussia|Albert]], Prussia's first duke and founder of the [[Albertina university]], holds an eye over the city. Above the sculptures the [[coat of arms]] of [[Sambia Peninsula|Samland]] and [[Natangen]] are shown.

The gate was damaged during the [[Second World War]]. Furthermore, as a first victory celebration, Soviet soldiers decapitated the statues. With the celebration of the city's 750-year existence in June 2005, the gate was renovated. A few months before the beginning of the festivities, the gate was still in a desolate condition. Within a few weeks, however, the gate was restored to its condition before the war. Fully restored statues replaced the decapitated ones on the gate with this renovation.

[[File:Napoleon stellt den israelitischen Kult wieder her, 30. Mai 1806.jpg|thumb|275px|An 1806 French print depicts [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] emancipating the Jews.]]
[[Revolutionary France]] enacted laws that first [[Jewish Emancipation|emancipated Jews]] in France, establishing them as equal citizens to other Frenchmen. In countries that [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s ensuing [[First French Empire]] conquered during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], he emancipated the Jews and introduced other ideas of freedom from the French Revolution. For instance, he overrode old laws restricting Jews to reside in [[ghettos]], as well as lifting laws that limited Jews' rights to property, worship, and certain occupations.

In an effort to promote Jewish integration into French society, however, Napoleon also implemented several policies that eroded Jewish distinction. For example, he restricted the Jewish practice of money-lending, restricted the regions to which Jews were allowed to migrate, and required Jews to adopt formal names. He also implemented a series of consistories -- which served as an effective channel utilized by the French government to regulate Jewish religious life. 

Historians have disagreed about Napoleon's intentions in these actions, as well as his personal and political feelings about the Jewish community. Some have said he had political reasons but did not have sympathy for the Jews. His actions were generally opposed by the leaders of monarchies in other countries. After his defeat by Great Britain, a counter-revolution swept many of these countries and they restored discriminatory measures against the Jews.

==Napoleon's Law and the Jews==

The [[French Revolution]] abolished the different treatment of people according to religion or origin that had existed under the monarchy. Roman Catholicism had been the established state religion, closely tied historically to the monarchy, which represented both religious and political authority. The 1789 [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] guaranteed [[freedom of religion]] and free exercise of worship, provided that it did not contradict public order. At that time, most other European countries implemented measures that restricted the rights of people in their nations who practiced minority religions.

In the early 19th century, through his conquests in Europe, Napoleon Bonaparte spread the modernist ideas of revolutionary France: equality of citizens and the rule of law. Napoleon's personal attitude towards the Jews has been interpreted in various ways by different historians, as at various times he made statements both in support and opposition to the Jewish people.  Orthodox Rabbi [[Berel Wein]] in ''Triumph of Survival: The Story of the Jews in the Modern Era 1650-1990'' (1990) claims that Napoleon was interested primarily in seeing the Jews assimilate, rather than prosper as a distinct community: "Napoleon's outward tolerance and fairness toward Jews was actually based upon his grand plan to have them disappear entirely by means of total assimilation, intermarriage, and conversion."{{page needed|date=October 2016}}

Napoleon was concerned about the role of Jews as money lenders, wanting to end that. The treatment of the Alsace Jews and their debtors was raised in the Imperial Council on 30 April 1806.&lt;!--What were the questions and resolution?  --&gt;{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} His liberation of the Jewish communities in Italy (notably in [[Ancona]] in the [[Papal States]]) and his insistence on the integration of Jews as equals in French and Italian societies demonstrate that he distinguished between usurers (whether Jewish or not), whom he compared to [[locusts]], and Jews who accepted non-Jews as their equals.

His letter to Champagny, Minister of the Interior of 29 November 1806, expresses his thoughts:
:[It is necessary to] reduce, if not destroy, the tendency of Jewish people to practice a very great number of activities that are harmful to civilisation and to public order in society in all the countries of the world. It is necessary to stop the harm by preventing it; to prevent it, it is necessary to change the Jews. [...] Once part of their youth will take its place in our armies, they will cease to have Jewish interests and sentiments; their interests and sentiments will be French.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

(While insisting on the primacy of civil law over the military, Napoleon retained a deep respect and affection for the military as a profession. He often hired former soldiers in civilian occupations).

Through his policies overall, Napoleon greatly improved the condition of the Jews in France and Europe, and they widely admired him. Starting in 1806, Napoleon passed a number of measures enhancing the position of the [[Jew]]s in the French Empire. He recognized a representative group elected by the Jewish community, the ''[[Sanhedrin#Napoleon Bonaparte's "Grand Sanhedrin"|Sanhedrin]],'' as their representatives to the French government.

In conquered countries, he abolished laws restricting Jews to living in [[ghetto]]s. In 1807, he designated [[Judaism]] as one of the official religions of France, along with [[Roman Catholicism]] (long the established state religion), and [[Lutheran]] and [[Calvinist]] [[Protestantism]]. (Followers of the latter had been severely persecuted by the monarchy in the late 17th and early 18th centuries.)

In 1808 Napoleon rolled back a number of reforms (under the so-called ''décret infâme'', or Infamous Decree, of 17 March 1808), declaring all debts with Jews to be annulled, reduced or postponed. The Infamous Decree imposed a ten-year ban on any kind of Jewish money-lending activity. Similarly, Jewish individuals who were in subservient positions -- such as a Jewish servant, military officer, or wife -- were unable to engage in any kind of money-lending activity without the explicit consent of their superiors. Napoleon's goal in implementing the Infamous Decree of 1808 was to integrate Jewish culture and customs into those of France. By restricting money-lending activity, Jews would be forced to engage in other practices for a living. Likewise, in order to even engage in money-lending activity, the decree required Jews to apply for an annual license, granted only with the recommendation of the Jews' local consistory and with the surety of the Jews' honesty&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/44955842|title=The Jews of modern France|last=1946-2011.|first=Hyman, Paula,|date=1998|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520919297|location=Berkeley|oclc=44955842}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This caused so much financial loss that the Jewish community nearly collapsed. On a different note, the Infamous Decree also placed heavy restrictions on the Jews' ability to migrate. The decree prevented the Jews from relocating to the regions of Alsace and required that Jews wishing to move to other regions of France own or purchase land to farm. It also required them to refrain from engaging in any kind of money-lending activity. (The law eventually only placed these restrictions on the Jews of the northeast.) Likewise, the French decree required Jewish individuals to serve in the French military, without any opportunity to provide a replacement individual&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/44955842|title=The Jews of modern France|last=1946-2011.|first=Hyman, Paula,|date=1998|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520919297|location=Berkeley|oclc=44955842}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The last component of the Infamous Decree – established in July 1808 – required Jews to adopt formal names with which they would be addressed. (Before, Jews were often referred to as “Joseph son of Benjamin.”) They were also prevented from selecting names of cities or names in the Hebrew Bible. Napoleon sought to integrate the Jewish people more fully into French society by establishing the guidelines they were required to follow in adopting names&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Napoleon ended these restrictions by 1811.

Historian [[Ben Weider]] argued that Napoleon had to be extremely careful in defending oppressed minorities such as Jews, because of keeping balance with other political interests, but says that the leader clearly saw political benefit to his Empire in the long term in supporting them. Napoleon hoped to use equality as a way of gaining advantage from discriminated groups, like Jews or Protestants.

Both aspects of his thinking can be seen in an 1822 response to physician Barry O'Meara, who had written to Napoleon after he had been exiled, asking why he pressed for the emancipation of the Jews:

:I wanted to make them leave off [[usury]], and become like other men...by putting them upon an equality, with Catholics, Protestants, and others, I hoped to make them become good citizens, and conduct themselves like others of the community...as their rabbins explained to them, that they ought not to practise usury to their own tribes, but were allowed to do so with Christians and others, that, therefore, as I had restored them to all their privileges...they were not permitted to practise usury with me or them, but to treat us as if we were of the tribe of Judah. Besides, I should have drawn great wealth to France as the Jews are very numerous, and would have flocked to a country where they enjoyed such superior privities. Moreover, I wanted to establish an universal liberty of conscience.&lt;ref name="o'meara"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://archive.org/stream/napoleoninexile01omegoog#page/n212/mode/2up|title= Napoleon in Exile |author= Barry Edward O'Meara |year= 1822 |accessdate=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a private letter to his brother [[Jérome Napoleon]], dated 6 March 1808, Napoleon expressed a conflicting view:

:I have undertaken to reform the Jews, but I have not endeavoured to draw more of them into my realm. Far from that, I have avoided doing anything which could show any esteem for the most despicable of mankind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://archive.org/stream/newlettersnapol02napogoog#page/n99/mode/2up |title= New letters of Napoleon I |year= 1898 |accessdate=15 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bonaparte's  proclamation to the Jews of Africa and Asia===

During Napoleon's [[Siege of Acre (1799)|siege of Acre]] in 1799, ''[[Le Moniteur Universel]],'' the main French newspaper during the French Revolution, published on 3 [[Prairial]], [[French Republican Calendar/Y7|Year vii]] ([[French Republican Calendar]], equivalent to 22 May 1799) a short statement that: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Buonaparte a fait publier une proclamation, dans laquelle il invite les juifs de l'Asie et de l'Afrique à venir se ranger sous ses drapeaux, pour rétablir l'ancienne Jérusalem; il en a déjà armé un grand nombre, et leurs bataillons menacent Alep."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6u8OAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA120&amp;dq=%22dans+laquelle+il+invite+les+juifs+de%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1vcETunzEcy38gP-1dytDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22dans%20laquelle%20il%20invite%20les%20juifs%20de%22&amp;f=false|title=Buonaparte peint par lui-même dans sa carrière militaire et politique|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This has been translated in English as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"[[Napoleon|Bonaparte]] has published a proclamation in which he invites all the Jews of Asia and Africa to gather under his flag in order to re-establish the ancient [[Jerusalem]]. He has already given arms to a great number, and their battalions threaten [[Aleppo]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.napoleonicsociety.com/french/pdf/NapoleonJuifs.pdf|title= Napoléon et les Juifs (in French) |author= Ben Weider|year= 1997 |quote= Bonaparte, Commandant en chef des Armées de la République Française en Afrique et en Asie, aux héritiers légitimes de la Palestin|pages= |publisher=Napoleonic Society| work=Congrès de la Société Internationale Napoléonienne, Alexandrie, Italie; 21-26 Juin 1997| accessdate=23 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Napoleon's forces lost to [[Great Britain]] and he never carried out his alleged plan. Historians such as Nathan Schur in ''Napoleon and the Holy Land'' (2006) believe that Napoleon intended the proclamation for propaganda and to build support for his campaign among the Jews in those regions. Ronald Schechter believes that the newspaper was reporting a rumor, as there is no documentation that Napoleon contemplated such a policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Ronald Schechter  | title = Obstinate Hebrews: Representations of Jews in France, 1715–1815 | publisher = University of California Press | year = 2003 | page = 201}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other historians &lt;!-- who? --&gt; suggest that the proclamation was intended to gain support from [[Haim Farhi]], the Jewish advisor to [[Jezzar Pasha|Ahmed al Jazzar]], the Muslim ruler of [[Acre (city)|Acre]], and to bring him over to Napoleon's side. Farhi commanded the defence of Acre on the field.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

In 1940, historian Franz Kobler claimed to have found a detailed version of the proclamation from a German translation.&lt;ref&gt;Franz Kobler, "Napoleon and the restoration of the Jews to Palestine", ''The New Judaea,'' September 1940&lt;/ref&gt; Kobler's claim was published in ''The New Judaea,'' the official periodical of the [[Zionist Organisation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=5f0ETqOkKcSY8QOIj6zIDQ&amp;ct=result&amp;id=I_NWAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22the+new+judaea%22&amp;q=%22the+new+judaea%22#search_anchor|title=The Menorah Journal|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kobler version suggests that Napoleon was inviting Jews across the Mideast and North Africa to create a Jewish state.&lt;ref name="Schwarzfuchs"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0197100236|title=Napoleon, the Jews and the Sanhedrin|author=Simon Schwarzfuchs 
|publisher=Routledge |date=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes phrases such as "Rightful heirs of Palestine!" and "your political existence as a nation among the nations." These concepts have been more commonly associated with the [[Zionist]] movement, which developed in the late 19th century.&lt;ref name="Schwarzfuchs"/&gt;

Historians such as Henry Laurens, Ronald Schechter, and Jeremy Popkin believe that the German document (which has never been found) was a forgery, as asserted by Simon Schwarzfuchs in his 1979 book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Simon Schwarzfuchs | title = Napoleon, the Jews and the Sanhedrin | publisher = Routledge | year = 1979 | pages = 24–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Laurens (scholar)|Laurens, Henry]], ''Orientales I, Autour de l'expédition d'Égypte'', pp.123–143, CNRS Éd (2004), {{ISBN|2-271-06193-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9udsEHFtikkC&amp;pg=PA287&amp;dq=%22franz+kobler%22+napoleon+1799&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Ev0ETuSsBIiw8gP20LC0DQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22franz%20kobler%22%20napoleon%201799&amp;f=false Ronald Schechter, ''Obstinate Hebrews: Representations of Jews in France, 1715–1815''], 2003.

Rabbi Aharon Ben-Levi of Jerusalem also added his voice to the proclamation, calling on the Jews to enlist in Napoleon's army "to return to Zion as in the days of Ezra and Nehemiah" and rebuild the Temple. According to Prof. [[Mordechai Gichon]], a military historian and archaeologist from Tel Aviv University, who summarized 40 years of research on the subject, Napoleon had an idea to establish a national home for the Jews in the Land of Israel, "Napoleon believed the Jews would repay his favors by serving French interests in the region."Gichon claimed. "After returning to France, all he was interested in when it came to the Jews was how to use them to reinforce the French nation," Gichon says. "Therefore, he tried to conceal the Zionist chapter of his past." On the other hand, Prof. Ze'ev Sternhell of Jerusalem's Hebrew University, however, believes the entire story is nothing more than an oddity. "Napoleon's big contribution came, in fact, in form of promoting the incorporation of the Jews into French society," &lt;ref&gt;https://www.haaretz.com/1.4827319&lt;/ref&gt;

==Napoleon's legacy==
Napoleon had more influence on the Jews in Europe than detailed in his decrees. By breaking up the feudal castes of mid-Europe and introducing the equality of the [[French Revolution]], he achieved more for Jewish emancipation than had been accomplished during the three preceding centuries. As part of recognizing the Jewish community, he established a national [[Consistory (Judaism)|Israelite Consistory]] in France. It was intended to serve as a centralizing authority for Jewish religious and community life. Napoleon implemented several other regional consistories throughout the French Empire, as well, with the Israelite Consistory serving as the lead consistory; it had the responsibility of overseeing the various regional consistories. The regional consistories, in turn, oversaw the economic and religious aspects of Jewish life. The regional consistories consisted of a five-individual board, usually occupied by one (or, in some cases two) rabbis, and the rest lay individuals who lived in the districts over which the consistory maintained jurisdiction. The Israelite Consistory in France consisted of three rabbis and two lay individuals. In charge of the Israelite Consistory (and the consistory system in general) was a 25-member board. The members of the board, all Jews, were appointed by the prefect, thus allowing the French government to regulate the system of consistories and, in turn, various aspects of Jewish life&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/44955842|title=The Jews of modern France|last=1946-2011.|first=Hyman, Paula,|date=1998|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520919297|location=Berkeley|oclc=44955842}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Similarly he established the [[Kingdom of Westphalia|Westphalia]] ({{Interlanguage link multi|Royal Westphalian Consistory of the Israelites|he|3=הקונסיסטוריה היהודית של וסטפליה}}). This served as a model for other German states until after the fall of Napoleon. Napoleon permanently improved the condition of the Jews in the Prussian [[Rhine provinces]] by his rule of this area.

[[Heinrich Heine|Heine]] and [[Ludwig Börne|Börne]] both recorded their sense of obligation to Napoleon's principles of action.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} The German Jews in particular have historically regarded Napoleon as the major forerunner of Jewish emancipation in Germany. When the government required Jews to select surnames according to the mainstream model, some are said to have taken the name of ''Schöntheil,'' a translation of "Bonaparte."{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} In the Jewish ghettos, legends grew up about Napoleon's actions. Twentieth-century Italian author [[Primo Levi]] wrote that Italian Jews often chose ''Napoleone'' and ''Bonaparte'' as their [[given name]] to recognize their historic liberator.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

===Reactions of major European powers===

The Russian [[Alexander I of Russia|Czar Alexander I]] objected to Napoleon's emancipation of the Jews and establishment of the Great Sanhedrin. He vehemently denounced the liberties given Jews and demanded that the Russian Orthodox Church protest against Napoleon's tolerant religious policy. He referred to the Emperor in a proclamation as "the Anti-Christ" and the "Enemy of God".{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

The Holy Synod of Moscow proclaimed: "In order to destroy the foundations of the Churches of Christendom, the Emperor of the French has invited into his capital all the Judaic synagogues and he furthermore intends to found a new Hebrew [[Sanhedrin]] ― the same council that the Christian bible states, condemned to death (by crucifixion) the revered figure, Jesus of Nazareth."{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

The Czar persuaded Napoleon to sign a 17 March 1808 decree restricting the freedoms accorded to the Jews. Napoleon expected in exchange that the Czar would help persuade Great Britain to end the war in Europe. Absent that, three months later, Napoleon effectively cancelled the decree by allowing local authorities to implement his earlier reforms. More than half of the French départements restored citizens' guaranteed freedoms to the Jews.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

In Austria, [[Klemens Wenzel, Prince von Metternich|Chancellor Metternich]] wrote, "I fear that the Jews will believe (Napoleon) to be their promised Messiah".{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

In Prussia, leaders of the Lutheran Church were extremely hostile to Napoleon's actions. Italian kingdoms were suspicious of his actions, although expressing less violent opposition. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Great Britain, which was at war with Napoleon, rejected the principle and doctrine of the Sanhedrin.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

===Jews in Europe===

All the states under French authority applied Napoleon's reforms. In Italy, the Netherlands, and the German states, the Jews were emancipated and able to act as free men for the first time in those nations. After the British defeated Napoleon at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]], a counter-revolution in many of these countries resulted in the restoration of discriminatory measures against Jews.

The '''United States Oath of Allegiance''', officially referred to as the "Oath of Allegiance," 8 C.F.R. Part 337 (2008), is an [[oath of allegiance|allegiance oath]] that must be taken by immigrants who wish to become [[United States citizen]]s.

The Oath of Allegiance may be administered by [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services|USCIS]] officials; by [[immigration judge]]s; and by eligible courts.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.uscis.gov/policymanual/HTML/PolicyManual-Volume12-PartJ-Chapter2.html#footnote-3 USCIS Policy Manual]'', Vol. 12 (Citizenship &amp; Naturalization), Part J (Oath of Allegiance), Chapter 2 (The Oath of Allegiance).&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Section 310(b)(1)(A) of the [[Immigration and Naturalization Act]] provides that "an eligible court ... shall have authority to administer such oath of allegiance to persons residing within the jurisdiction of the court." Section 310(b)(5) defines "eligible court" for this purposes as "a [[United States district court|district court of the United States]] in any State" or "any [[court of record]] in any State having a seal, a clerk, and jurisdiction in actions in law or equity, or law and equity, in which [[General jurisdiction|the amount in controversy is unlimited]]."}}

==Text==
The current oath is as follows:

{{quote|I hereby declare, on oath, that I absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or sovereignty of whom or which I have heretofore been a subject or citizen; that I will support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I will bear arms on behalf of the United States when required by the law; that I will perform noncombatant service in the Armed Forces of the United States when required by the law; that I will perform work of national importance under civilian direction when required by the law; and that I take this obligation freely without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; so help me God.&lt;ref name=uscis&gt;{{Citation

|title=Oath of Allegiance for Naturalized Citizens
|publisher=Citizenship and Immigration Services, U.S. Department of Homeland Security
|accessdate=2010-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Modifications===

{{USCFR|8|337|1}} provides that the phrase "so help me God" is optional and that the words 'on oath' can be substituted with 'and solemnly affirm'.

{{USC|8|1448}} provides that if the prospective citizen is unable or unwilling to promise to bear arms or perform noncombatant military service because of "religious training and belief", they may request to leave out those clauses.  The law specifies:

{{quote|The term "religious training and belief" as used in this section shall mean an individual's belief in a relation to a Supreme Being involving duties superior to those arising from any human relation, but does not include essentially political, sociological, or philosophical views or a merely personal moral code.&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|8|1448}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Qualifying for this modification may require supporting documentation from the applicant's religious organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/files/article/chapter5.pdf Chapter 5, A Guide to Naturalization].&lt;/ref&gt;  The applicant is not required to belong to a specific religious group, but must have "a sincere and meaningful belief that has a place in the applicant's life that is equivalent to that of a religious belief".&lt;ref name=uscis12j3&gt;USCIS Policy Manual, [https://www.uscis.gov/policymanual/HTML/PolicyManual-Volume12-PartJ-Chapter3.html 12 USCIS-PM J.3]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Waivers===

The requirement to take the Oath is waived by USCIS for children under 14 years of age at the time of naturalization.&lt;ref name=uscis12j3/&gt;  The requirement may also be waived for any person unable to understand or communicate an understanding of the Oath due to a physical disability or mental impairment.

==History==

During the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], oaths of allegiance were administered to officers of the [[Continental Army]], pursuant to a Congressional resolution of February 3, 1778.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Waldenmaier |first=Nellie |title=Some of the Earliest Oaths of Allegiance to the United States of America |year=1944 |publisher=Lancaster Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An example appears below.

{{quote|I James Glentworth, Lieut, of 6th Pennya. Reg. do acknowledge
the UNITED STATES of AMERICA to be Free, Independent
and Sovereign States, and declare that the people thereof owe no
allegiance or obedience to George the Third, King of Great
Britain; and I renounce, refuse and abjure any allegiance or 
obedience to him ; and I do Swear that I will, to the utmost of my
power, support, maintain and defend the said United States against
the said King George the Third, his heirs and successors, and his
or their abettors, assistants and adherents, and will serve the said
United States in the office of Lieutenant which I now hold, with
fidelity, according to the best of my skill and understanding.

The Oath of Allegiance for prospective citizens originated with the [[Naturalization Act of 1790]], which required applicants to take an oath or affirmation "to support the constitution of the United States", but did not provide a text.  The [[Naturalization Act of 1795]] added renunciation of the new citizen's former sovereign to the oath.  The [[Naturalization Act of 1906]] added the section of the oath requiring new citizens to defend the Constitution and laws of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic; and bear true faith and allegiance to the same.

The Oath acquired a standard text in 1929.&lt;ref name=uscis/&gt;  Prior to then, spoken oaths were adapted from naturalization law, and each court could develop its own procedures for administering the oath.

The [[McCarran Internal Security Act|Internal Security Act]] of 1950 added the text about bearing arms and performing noncombatant service in the armed forces of the United States.  The section about performing work of national importance under civilian direction was added by the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952]].

==Changing the oath==

The current exact text of the Oath of Citizenship is established only in the form of an administrative regulation promulgated by the executive branch.  Under the [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedure Act]], CIS could theoretically change the text of the oath at any time, so long as the new text reasonably meets the "five principles" mandated by the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1953. These principles are:

*allegiance to the [[United States Constitution]],
*renunciation of allegiance to any foreign country to which the immigrant has had previous allegiances
*defense of the Constitution against enemies "foreign and domestic"
*promise to serve in the [[United States Armed Forces]] when required by law (either combat or non-combat)
*promise to perform civilian duties of "national importance" when required by law

There has been some controversy about the wording of the oath, parts of which are based on the British [[Oath of Supremacy]]{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} which was written in the 16th Century. As a result, some{{who|date=October 2013}} have suggested much of the language is antiquated and confusing. In the fall of 2003, CIS planned to change the oath of citizenship in time for [[Citizenship Day]] (September 17).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uscis.gov/files/pressrelease/Citizen_Day_13_Sep_05.pdf US Citizenship and Immigration Services Fact Sheet]&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed oath was as follows:

{{quote|Solemnly, freely, and without mental reservation, I hereby renounce under oath all allegiance to any foreign state. My fidelity and allegiance from this day forward is to the United States of America. I pledge to support, honor, and be loyal to the United States, its Constitution, and its laws. Where and if lawfully required, I further commit myself to defend the Constitution and laws of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic, either by military, noncombatant, or civilian service. This I do solemnly swear, so help me God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The introduction of the new oath was scrapped by the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Border Security, and Claims on April 1, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Incidents and controversies==

In ''[[United States v. Schwimmer]]'' (1929), the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the denial of citizenship to an applicant who declared not to be willing to "take up arms personally" in defense of the United States.  The applicant, Hungarian-born female suffragist [[Rosika Schwimmer]], had written that she was an "uncompromising pacifist" with "no sense of nationalism, only a cosmic consciousness of belonging to the human family".  The Court found that persons holding such views were "liable to be incapable of the attachment for and devotion to the principles of our Constitution" that are required for naturalization.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/279/644/case.html United States v. Schwimmer]'', 279 U.S. 644 (1929).&lt;/ref&gt;

English writer [[Aldous Huxley]], author of ''Brave New World'', applied for U.S. citizenship in 1953 after having lived in the United States for fourteen years.  When asked if he would bear arms and perform noncombatant military service as required by the Oath, Huxley answered in the negative and was summoned before a judge.  Huxley explained that his objection was based on philosophical convictions about the evil of war rather than religious beliefs.  The judge adjourned proceedings and postponed a decision on Huxley's application in order to report to Washington.  Huxley never received U.S. citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bedford |first=Sybille |title=Aldous Huxley: A Biography |year=2002 |publisher=Ivan R Dee |isbn=978-1-56663-454-0}}, p. 531-535, 545-546.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1968 case ''[[In re Weitzman]]'', a U.S. district court considered the naturalization petition of Brenda Weitzman, a 25-year-old mother of two children from South Africa and religious [[non-believer]] who had refused to take the part of the Oath requiring her to serve in the Armed Forces.  She expressed a total "objection to warfare and the bearing of arms" ([[conscientious objector]]ship), being "repulsed by no particular war, but by all killing."  The court, finding that her stance was "based on a personal moral code and not on religious training and belief" and that she did not recognize anything "tantamount to a God or a Supreme Being", denied her petition.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/284/514/1815591/ In re Weitzman]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The precedent relied upon was [[United States v. Seeger]]. However the Supreme Court, in their 1970 ruling on ''Welsh v. United States'',&lt;ref name=Welsh&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/398/333|title = Welsh v. United States|date = June 15, 1970|accessdate = September 1, 2016|website = law.cornell.edu |publisher = Cornell University Law School}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
having noted the case factually similar and controlled by United States v. Seeger, determined in respect to the provision in the Universal Military Training and Service Act that exempts from military service persons who by reason of "religious training and belief" are conscientiously opposed to war, that the Act:

{{quote|contravenes the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment by exempting those whose conscientious objection claims are founded on a theistic belief, while not exempting those whose claims are based on a secular belief. To comport with that clause, an exemption must be "neutral" and include those whose belief emanates from a purely moral, ethical, or philosophical source.|author= MR. JUSTICE HARLAN}}

This judgement was used in 2013 to reverse a denial of citizenship to Margaret Doughty, a 65 year old British atheist who had lived in the US for 30 years, unless she could show proof of membership in a church with pacifist beliefs to support her claim that she was a conscientious objector entitled to omit the Oath's clause about bearing arms.&lt;ref name="rt.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://rt.com/usa/doughty-atheist-citizenship-arms-012/|title = Atheist seeking US citizenship told to join church or be denied|last = |first = |date = |work = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The USCIS retracted their demand after receiving a letter from an atheist group that objected based on Welsh vs. United States.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/20/margaret-doughty-approved-citizenship_n_3474981.html|title = Margaret Doughty Approved For Citizenship As USCIS Backs Down In Flap Over Atheist Opposition To War|last = |first = |date = |work = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Welsh/&gt;

'''''The Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium''''' (often abbreviated to '''ODB''') is a three-volume historical dictionary published by the English [[Oxford University Press]]. With more than 5,000 entries, it contains comprehensive information in English on topics relating to the [[Byzantine Empire]]. It was edited by [[Alexander Kazhdan]], and was first published in 1991.&lt;ref name=Oxf&gt;''The Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium'', [[Oxford University Press]], New York and Oxford, 1991. {{ISBN|0195046528}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kazhdan was a professor at [[Princeton University]] who became a Senior Research Associate at [[Dumbarton Oaks]], [[Washington, DC]] before his death. He contributed to many of the articles in the Dictionary and always signed his initials ''A.K.'' at the end of the article to indicate his contribution.

==Description==
The dictionary is available in printed and e-reference text versions from [[Oxford Reference Online]]. It covers the main historical events of Byzantium, as well as important social and religious events. It also includes biographies of eminent political and literary personalities and describes in detail religious, social, cultural, legal and political topics.

'''''Paths of Glory''''' is a 1917 painting by British artist [[Christopher Nevinson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-27903827|title=The faceless men|date=23 June 2014|accessdate=23 June 2014|author=Allan Little|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title quotes from a line from [[Thomas Gray]]'s poem ''[[Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard]]'': "The paths of glory lead but to the grave". It is held by the [[Imperial War Museum]] in London, which describes it as "one of Nevinson's most famous paintings".&lt;ref name=IWMPaths&gt;{{cite web |author=Imperial War Museum|url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/20211|title=Search the Collection;- ''Paths of Glory'' |year=|accessdate=3 February 2015|work=[[Imperial War Museum]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCHistoryPaths&gt;{{cite web |author=Imperial War Museum|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/trail/wars_conflict/art/art_daily_life_04.shtml |title=''Paths of Glory'' by CRW Nevinson |date=4 April 2005|accessdate=3 February 2015|work=BBC History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Nevinson had served as a volunteer ambulance driver with the [[Friends' Ambulance Service]] on the Western Front in the early months of the First World War, from November 1914 to January 1915, and then returned to England.  He served as an orderly in the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] in London but was invalided out in late 1915 due to [[rheumatic fever]]. During this period he painted several paintings such as ''[[La Mitrailleuse]]'' (1915) and ''The Doctor'' (1916).

He was commissioned as a [[war artist]] in 1917 and was sent to France by the British [[War Propaganda Bureau]].  He adopted a [[Realism (arts)|Realist]] style to depict the horror of the war, moved decisively away from his earlier [[Modernist]] and [[Vorticist]] styles.  

==Painting==
The painting measures {{convert|45.7|xx|60.9|cm|in}}. It depicts two dead British soldiers, face down in a battlefield on the Western Front.  They lie unburied in a muddy landscape that is bare save for barriers of barbed wire and the detritus of war.  

The painting was censored by the official censor of paintings and drawings in France, Lieutenant Colonel [[A N Lee]], on the grounds that displaying dead bodies would hinder the war effort. Nonetheless, Nevinson included the painting in his official exhibition at the [[Leicester Galleries]] in March 1918, but the work was displayed with a brown paper strip across the bodies bearing the word "censored".&lt;ref name="DBHcrisis"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[David Boyd Haycock]]|publisher=Old Street Publishing (London)|year=2009|title=A Crisis of Brilliance: Five Young British Artists and the Great War|ISBN=978-1-905847-84-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevinson was reprimanded by the [[War Office]] for exhibiting a censored image, and for using the word "censored" in public without authorisation, but obtained significant publicity, particularly as the first exhibition of official colour tinted photographs from the front (including images of actual dead bodies) opened on 4 March.  The painting was bought by the Imperial War Museum direct from the exhibition, as the work had been commissioned by the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]].

The same title was used for several books and the [[Paths of Glory|1957 war film]] directed by [[Stanley Kubrick]].

      <comment>supplied some citations; from what I've seen so far not clear whether Clermont-Ganneau or Macalister discovered first -- the Gezer excavations began in 1902, Macalister published on a non-Gezer weight in 1907, the Gezer excavations were published in 1912. All depends on when in the Gezer excavations the weight was found, and how long before 1907 C-G's weight was found.</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3122">'''Pim weights''' were polished stones about 15&amp;nbsp;mm (5/8 [[inch]]) diameter, equal to about two-thirds of a [[Hebrew people|Hebrew]] [[shekel]].  Many specimens have been found since their initial discovery early in the 20th century, and each one weighs about 7.6 [[gram]]s, compared to 11.5 [[gram]]s of a [[shekel]].  Its name, which can also be transliterated as "payim", comes from the inscription seen across the top of its dome shape: the [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] letters 𐤐𐤉‬‬𐤌‬ (Hebrew {{Script/Hebrew|פים}}, transliterated '''pym'''). [[Image:Pim-weight drawing.gif|right|Drawing of the first Pim weight ever published; found at Gezer]]

==Impact==
Prior to the discovery of the weights by archaeologists, scholars did not know how to translate the word ''pim'' (פִ֗ים ''p̄îm'') in [[Books of Samuel|1 Samuel]] 13:21.&lt;ref&gt;William G.

An incomplete version [https://archive.org/details/RecueilDarcheologieOrientaletome8 is available online], which does not include the section in which Macalister says the work on the pim weights is found.&lt;/ref&gt;

Here is the 1611 translation of the [[King James Version of the Bible]]:

:''Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads.''

The 1982 [[New King James Version]] rendered it:

:''And the charge for a sharpening was a &lt;u&gt;pim&lt;/u&gt; for the plowshares, the mattocks, the forks, and the axes, and to set the points of the goads.''

It probably originally dates from the reign of [[Peter the Great]], but this impression probably dates from c. 1766.  Possibly a satire on Peter's reforms, or just a representation of carnivalesque inversion, "turning the world upside down".]]

'''Popular prints''' is a term for [[printing|printed]] images of generally low artistic quality which were sold cheaply in Europe and later the New World from the 15th to 18th centuries, often with text as well as images. They were some of the earliest examples of [[mass media]]. After about 1800, the types and quantity of images greatly increased, but other terms are usually used to categorise them.

== 15th century ==
[[File:Zehen eygenschaft des altters der menschen BM 1872 0608 351.jpg|thumb|left|''The Seven Ages of Man'', German, 1482, [[British Museum]]]]
From about 1400, there began a "visual revolution that inundated Europe with images during the fifteenth century" (Field) as the [[woodcut]] technique was applied to [[paper]], which was now manufactured in Christian Europe, instead of being imported from Islamic Spain. In the 15th century, the great majority of these images were religious, if [[playing card]]s are excluded. They were sold at churches, fairs and places of pilgrimage. Most were coloured, usually crudely, by hand or later by [[stencil]].  One political [[cartoon]] relating to events in 1468-70 has survived in several different versions (many from years later).  [[Old master print]] is a term that at this period includes popular prints, but later is restricted to more expensive and purely artistic prints. 

Although early information as to prices is almost non-existent, it is clear from a number of sources that small [[woodcut]]s were affordable by at least the urban working-class, and much of the [[peasant]] class as well.

During the middle of the century, the quality of the images became typically very low, but there was an improvement towards the end, partly because it was necessary to keep pace with the quality of images in [[engraving]]s. [[Engraving]]s were always much more expensive to create, as they needed greater skill to create the plate, which would last for far fewer impressions than a [[woodcut]]. They did not come into the popular prints category until the 19th century, when different techniques made them much cheaper.

== 16th century ==
[[File:Zentralbibliothek Zürich - Von einem schrecklichen und wunderbarlichen Cometen so sich den Dienstag nach Martini dieses lauffenden M D LXXViJ Jahrs am Himmel erzeiget hat - 000003593.jpg|thumb|[[Great Comet of 1577|Der Große Komet]] über [[Prague|Prag]], 12. November 1577, [[Zentralbibliothek Zürich]]]]

Broadsheets, also known as broadsides, were a common format. They were usually single sheets of paper of various sizes, typically sold by street-vendors. Another format was the [[chapbook]], usually a single sheet cut or folded to make a small pamphlet or book. In Spain there were ''[[pliego]]''s, in Portugal the ''[[papel volante]]'', and in other countries other names. These covered a great variety of material, including pictures, popular history, political comment or [[satire]], news, [[almanac]]s (from c.   1470), poems and songs.  They could be very influential politically, and were often subsidized by political factions for propaganda purposes.  See [[Broadside (music)]] for their musical use.  The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] hugely increased the market for satirical and polemical prints in all counties affected. In [[France]] the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]], and in England the [[English Civil War]] and the political convulsions after the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] all produced huge quantities of propaganda and polemic, in images as well as text.

Despite being often issued in large numbers, their survival rate was extremely low, and they are now very rare, with most having not survived at all.  This has been demonstrated by analysis of the records of the [[London]] Stationers Company from 1550 onwards; some blocks were in print for over a century with no copies now surviving.  They were very commonly pasted to the walls of rooms.  Paper was still sufficiently expensive that all available spare pieces tended to be used in the toilet. One of the biggest surviving collections with 439 prints is [[Wickiana]] at the [[Zentralbibliothek Zürich]].

== After 1600 ==
[[Image:Caricature gillray plumpudding.jpg|thumb|left|[[James Gillray]]'s ''[[The Plumb-pudding in danger]]'' (1805),  which caricatured [[William Pitt the Younger|Pitt]] and [[Napoleon I|Napoleon]], was voted the most famous of all UK political cartoons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Br J Rev |year=2006 |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=59–64 |author= Preston O |title= Cartoons... at last a big draw |doi=10.1177/0956474806064768}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Library of Congress]]]]

Newspapers began in the early 17th century, as an upmarket and expensive form of broadsheet (still a [[broadsheet|term]] for a large-format newspaper).  The first in English came in 1620.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bl.uk/collections/britnews.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-04-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003170056/http://www.bl.uk/collections/britnews.html |archivedate=2008-10-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During this century [[book]]s also became much cheaper, and began to replace some types of popular print.  These trends continued during the next century, and although most of the traditional types of popular print lived on until the 19th century or beyond, they were by then part of a much wider print culture, and the term is generally not used of them. One type of publication continuing into the 20th century is the [[Brazil]]ian ''[[cordel literature]]'' ("string literature" - it is hung on strings by the sellers) that continue to use woodcuts, and is part of a continuous tradition going back to the Portuguese ''[[papel volante]]'' of the 17th century. [[Lubok]] prints in [[Russia]] were another local variant.

Political [[caricature]] prints for sale as single sheets are found as early as the 15th century, but reached the peak of their popularity in much of Europe in the 18th and early 19th century, before the form migrated into newspapers and magazines. Above all they were popular in England, where a high degree of [[freedom of the press]] meant that dedicated print-shops, often also acting as the publishers, could openly sell and display scathing images of the Royal Family and government politicians, a business that had to remain "under the counter" in much of Europe.

[[File:Gramsci 1922.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Antonio Gramsci]], depicted in 1922]]
The '''''Prison Notebooks''''' ({{lang-it|Quaderni del carcere}} {{IPA-it|kwaˈdɛrni del ˈkartʃere|}}) were a series of [[essay]]s written by the Italian [[neo-Marxism|neo-Marxist]] [[Antonio Gramsci]]. Gramsci was imprisoned by the Italian [[Fascist]] regime in 1926. The notebooks were written between 1929 and 1935, when Gramsci was released from prison on grounds of ill-health. He died in April 1937.

He wrote more than 30 notebooks and 3,000 pages of history and analysis during his imprisonment. Although written unsystematically, the ''Prison Notebooks'' are considered a highly original contribution to 20th century [[political theory]]. Gramsci drew insights from varying sources - not only other Marxists but also thinkers such as [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], [[Vilfredo Pareto]], [[Georges Sorel]] and [[Benedetto Croce]]. His notebooks cover a wide range of topics, including [[History of Italy|Italian history]] and [[Italian nationalism|nationalism]], [[the French Revolution]], [[Fascism]], [[Fordism]], [[civil society]], [[folklore]], [[religion]] and [[high culture|high]] and [[popular culture]].

The notebooks were smuggled out of prison in the 1930s. They were not published until the 1950s and were first translated into English in the 1970s, by the Scottish poet and folklorist [[Hamish Henderson]].

Some ideas in [[Marxist theory]], [[critical theory]] and educational theory that are associated with Gramsci's name:
* [[Cultural hegemony]] as a means of maintaining the [[capitalism|capitalist]] state.
* The need for popular workers' education to encourage development of intellectuals from the [[working class]].
* The distinction between political society (the police, the army, legal system, etc.) which dominates directly and coercively, and [[civil society]] (the family, the education system, trade unions, etc.) where leadership is constituted through ideology or by means of consent.
* "Absolute [[historicism]]".
* A critique of [[economic determinism]] that opposes fatalistic interpretations of Marxism.
* A critique of [[materialism|philosophical materialism]].

==Hegemony==
{{details|Cultural hegemony}}
[[Hegemony]] was a concept previously used by Marxists such as [[Vladimir Ilyich Lenin]] to indicate the political leadership of the [[working-class]] in a democratic revolution, but developed by Gramsci into an acute analysis to explain why the 'inevitable' [[socialist]] revolution predicted by orthodox Marxism had not occurred by the early 20th century. Capitalism, it seemed, was even more entrenched than ever. Capitalism, Gramsci suggested, maintained control not just through violence and political and economic coercion, but also [[ideology|ideologically]], through a hegemonic culture in which the values of the [[bourgeoisie]] became the '[[common sense]]' values of all. Thus a consensus culture developed in which people in the [[working-class]] identified their own good with the good of the bourgeoisie, and helped to maintain the ''status quo'' rather than revolting.

The working class needed to develop a culture of its own, which would overthrow the notion that bourgeois values represented 'natural' or 'normal' values for society, and would attract the oppressed and intellectual classes to the cause of the proletariat. Lenin held that culture was 'ancillary' to political objectives but for Gramsci it was fundamental to the attainment of power that ''[[cultural hegemony]]'' be achieved first. In Gramsci's view, any class that wishes to dominate in modern conditions has to move beyond its own narrow ‘economic-corporate’ interests, to exert intellectual and moral leadership, and to make alliances and compromises with a variety of forces. Gramsci calls this union of social forces a ‘historic bloc’, taking a term from [[Georges Sorel]]. This bloc forms the basis of consent to a certain social order, which produces and re-produces the hegemony of the dominant class through a nexus of institutions, [[social relations]] and ideas. In this manner, Gramsci developed a theory that emphasized the importance of the [[base and superstructure|superstructure]] in both maintaining and fracturing relations of the [[Base (politics)|base]].

Gramsci stated that, in the West, bourgeois cultural values were tied to religion, and therefore much of his polemic against hegemonic culture is aimed at religious norms and values. He was impressed by the power [[Roman Catholicism]] had over men's minds and the care the Church had taken to prevent an excessive gap developing between the religion of the learned and that of the less educated. Gramsci believed that it was Marxism's task to marry the purely intellectual critique of religion found in [[Renaissance humanism]] to the elements of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] that had appealed to the masses. For Gramsci, Marxism could supersede religion only if it met people's spiritual needs, and to do so people would have to recognize it as an expression of their own experience.

For Gramsci, hegemonic dominance ultimately relied on coercion, and in a "crisis of authority" the "masks of consent" slip away, revealing the fist of force.

==Intellectuals and education==

Gramsci gave much thought to the question of the role of intellectuals in society. Famously, he stated that all men are intellectuals, in that all have intellectual and rational faculties, but not all men have the social function of intellectuals. He claimed that modern intellectuals were not simply talkers, but directors and organisers who helped build society and produce hegemony by means of ideological apparatuses such as education and the [[Mass media|media]]. Furthermore, he distinguished between a 'traditional' [[intelligentsia]] which sees itself (wrongly) as a class apart from society, and the thinking groups which every class produces from its own ranks 'organically'. Such 'organic' intellectuals do not simply describe social life in accordance with scientific rules, but rather [[articulation (sociology)|articulate]], through the language of culture, the feelings and experiences which the masses could not express for themselves. The need to create a [[working-class culture]] relates to Gramsci's call for a kind of education that could develop working-class intellectuals, who would not simply introduce Marxist ideology from outside the proletariat, but rather renovate and make critical the ''status quo'' of the already existing intellectual activity of the masses. His ideas about an education system for this purpose correspond with the notion of [[critical pedagogy]] and [[popular education]] as theorized and practised in later decades by [[Paulo Freire]] in Brazil, and have much in common with the thought of [[Frantz Fanon]]. For this reason, partisans of adult and popular education consider Gramsci an important voice to this day. (For the results of this kind of thought in education, see the latests reports of PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment) on the education in Brazil).

==State and civil society==

Gramsci's theory of hegemony is tied to his conception of the capitalist state, which he claims rules through force plus consent. The state is not to be understood in the narrow sense of the government; instead, Gramsci divides it between 'political society', which is the arena of political institutions and legal constitutional control, and '[[civil society]]', which is commonly seen as the 'private' or 'non-state' sphere, differentiated from both the state and the economy. The former is the realm of force and the latter of consent. He stresses, however, that the division is purely conceptual and that the two, in reality, often overlap.

Gramsci claims that hegemony lies under modern capitalism and that the [[bourgeoisie]] can maintain its economic control by allowing certain demands made by [[trade unions]] and mass political parties within civil society to be met by the political sphere. Thus, the bourgeoisie engages in [[Passive Revolution]] by going beyond its immediate economic interests and allowing the forms of its hegemony to change. Gramsci posits that movements such as [[reformism]] and [[fascism]], as well as the '[[scientific management]]' and [[assembly line]] methods of [[Frederick Winslow Taylor|Frederick Taylor]] and [[Henry Ford]] respectively, are examples of this.

Drawing from [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]], he argues that 'The Modern Prince' – the revolutionary party – is the force that will allow the working-class to develop organic intellectuals and an alternative hegemony within civil society. For Gramsci, the complex nature of modern civil society means that the only tactic capable of undermining bourgeois hegemony and leading to socialism is a 'war of position' (analogous to [[trench warfare]]); this war of position would then give way to a 'war of movement' (or frontal attack). Gramsci saw 'war of movement' as being exemplified by the storming of the [[Winter Palace]] during the [[October Revolution|Russian Revolution]].

Despite his claim that the lines between the two may be blurred, Gramsci rejects the state-worship that results from identifying political society with civil society, as was done by the [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobins]] and Fascists. He believes the proletariat's historical task is to create a 'regulated society' and defines the '[[withering away of the state]]' as the full development of civil society's ability to regulate itself.

==Historicism==

Gramsci, like the early [[Karl Marx|Marx]], was an emphatic proponent of [[historicism]]. In Gramsci's view, all meaning derives from the relation between human practical activity (or "[[praxis (process)|praxis]]") and the "objective" historical and social processes of which it is a part. Ideas cannot be understood outside their social and historical context, apart from their function and origin. The concepts by which we organise our knowledge of the world do not derive primarily from our relation to things, but rather from the social relations between the users of those concepts. As a result, there is no such thing as an unchanging "[[human nature]]", but only an idea of such which varies historically. Furthermore, philosophy and science do not "reflect" a reality independent of man, but rather are only "true" in that they express the real developmental trend of a given historical situation.

For the majority of Marxists, truth was truth no matter when and where it is known, and scientific knowledge (which included Marxism) accumulated historically as the advance of truth in this everyday sense. On this view, Marxism could not be said to not belong to the illusory realm of the superstructure because it is a science. In contrast, Gramsci believed Marxism was "true" in the socially pragmatic sense, in that by articulating the [[class consciousness]] of the [[proletariat]], it expressed the "truth" of its times better than any other theory. This anti-[[scientism|scientistic]] and anti-[[positivism|positivist]] stance was indebted to the influence of Benedetto Croce. However, it should be underlined that Gramsci's was an "absolute historicism" that broke with the Hegelian and idealist tenor of Croce's thinking and its tendency to secure a metaphysical synthesis in historical "destiny". Though Gramsci repudiates the charge, his historical account of truth has been criticised as a form of [[relativism]].

==Critique of "economism"==

In a famous pre-prison article entitled "The Revolution against ''[[Das Kapital]]''", Gramsci claimed that the [[October Revolution]] in Russia had invalidated the idea that socialist revolution had to await the full development of capitalist [[productive forces|forces of production]]. This reflected his view that Marxism was not a [[determinism|determinist]] philosophy. The principle of the causal "primacy" of the [[forces of production]], he held, was a misconception of Marxism. Both economic changes and cultural changes are expressions of a "basic historical process", and it is difficult to say which sphere has primacy over the other. The [[fatalism|fatalistic]] belief, widespread within the [[labour movement|workers’ movement]] in its earliest years, that it would inevitably triumph due to "historical laws", was, in Gramsci's view, a product of the historical circumstances of an oppressed class restricted mainly to defensive action, and was to be abandoned as a hindrance once the working-class became able to take the initiative. Because Marxism is a "philosophy of praxis", it cannot rely on unseen "historical laws" as the agents of social change. History is defined by human praxis and therefore includes human will. Nonetheless, will-power cannot achieve anything it likes in any given situation: when the consciousness of the working-class reaches the stage of development necessary for action, historical circumstances will be encountered which cannot be arbitrarily altered. It is not, however, predetermined by historical inevitability as to which of several possible developments will take place as a result.

His critique of [[Economic determinism|economism]] also extended to that practised by the syndicalists of the Italian trade unions.  He believed that many trade unionists had settled for a reformist, gradualist approach in that they had refused to struggle on the political front in addition to the economic front.  While Gramsci envisioned the trade unions as one organ of a counter-hegemonic force in capitalist society, the trade union leaders simply saw these organizations as a means to improve conditions within the existing structure.  Gramsci referred to the views of these trade unionists as "vulgar economism", which he equated to covert reformism and even liberalism.

==Critique of Materialism==

By virtue of his belief that human history and collective praxis determine whether any philosophical question is meaningful or not, Gramsci's views run contrary to the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] [[materialism]] and 'copy' theory of perception advanced by [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]] and Lenin, though he does not explicitly state this. For Gramsci, Marxism does not deal with a reality that exists in and for itself, independent of humanity. The concept of an [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] universe outside of human history and human praxis was, in his view, analogous to belief in [[God]]; there could be no objectivity, but only a universal [[intersubjectivity]] to be established in a future communist society. Natural history was thus only meaningful in relation to human history. On his view philosophical materialism, like primitive common sense, resulted from a lack of critical thought, and could not, as Lenin&lt;ref&gt;Lenin: [http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1908/mec/index.htm ''Materialism and Empirio-Criticism''].&lt;/ref&gt; claimed, be said to oppose religious superstition. Despite this, Gramsci resigned himself to the existence of this arguably cruder form of Marxism: the proletariat's status as a dependent class meant that Marxism, as its philosophy, could often only be expressed in the form of popular superstition and common sense. Nonetheless, it was necessary to effectively challenge the ideologies of the educated classes, and to do so Marxists must present their philosophy in a more sophisticated guise, and attempt to genuinely understand their opponents’ views.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8558">In [[modal logic]] and the [[philosophy of language]], a term is said to be a '''rigid designator''' or '''absolute substantial term''' when it designates (picks out, denotes, refers to) the same thing in ''all [[possible worlds]]'' in which that thing exists&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy'', Revised Second Edition 2008, p. 318&lt;/ref&gt; and does not designate anything else in those possible worlds in which that thing does ''not'' exist. A designator is ''persistently rigid'' if it designates the same thing in every possible world in which that thing exists and designates nothing in all other possible worlds. A designator is ''obstinately rigid'' if it designates the same thing in every possible world, period, whether or not that thing exists in that world. Rigid designators are contrasted with [[Non-rigid designator|''connotative terms'', ''non-rigid'' or ''flaccid designators'']], which may designate different things in different possible worlds.

==History==
The [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] philosophers in the [[Middle Ages]] developed a theory of [[properties of terms]] in which different classifications of [[concepts]] feature prominently.

Concepts, and the terms that signify them, can be divided into '''absolute''' or '''connotative''', according to the mode in which they signify. If they signify something absolutely, that is, after the manner of substance, they are '''absolute''', for example rock, lion, man, whiteness, wisdom, tallness. If they signify something connotatively, that is, with reference to a subject of inherence, i.e., after the manner of accidents, they are '''connotative''', for example, white, wise, tall.

Both connotative and absolute concepts can be used to signify accidents, but since connotative concepts signify with a reference to a subject of inherence, they can refer to object with different definitions and properties (i.e. with different ''essences''). For example, large, as a connotative concept, can signify objects with many distinct essences: a man, a lion, a triangle can be large.

On the other hand, absolute concepts signify objects that have the same definitions and properties. For example, the concept of gold, as an absolute concept, can signify only objects with the same definitions and properties (i.e. with the same ''essence'').

==Proper names and definite descriptions==
The notion of absolute concepts was then revived by [[Saul Kripke]], with the name “rigid designation”, in the lectures that became ''[[Naming and Necessity]]'', in the course of his argument against [[Descriptivist theory of names|descriptivist]] theories of reference, building on the work of [[Ruth Barcan Marcus]]. At the time of Kripke's lectures, the dominant theory of reference in [[analytic philosophy]] (associated with the theories of [[Gottlob Frege]] and [[Bertrand Russell]]) was that the meaning of sentences involving proper names could be given by substituting a contextually appropriate description for the name. Russell,&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Bertrand (1917), ''Knowledge by Acquaintance and Knowledge by Description''&lt;/ref&gt; for example, famously held that someone who had never met [[Otto von Bismarck]] might know of him as ''the first [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor of the German Empire]]'', and if so, his statement that (say) "Bismarck was a ruthless politician" should be understood to mean "The first Chancellor of the German Empire was a ruthless politician" (which could in turn be analysed into a series of more basic statements according to the method Russell introduced in his theory of [[definite descriptions]]). Kripke argued—against both the Russellian analysis and several attempted refinements of it—that such descriptions could not possibly ''mean the same thing'' as the name "Bismarck," on the grounds that proper names such as "Bismarck" always designate ''rigidly'', whereas descriptions such as "the first Chancellor of the German Empire" do not. Thus, for example, it ''might have been the case'' that Bismarck died in infancy. If so, he would not have ever satisfied the description "the first Chancellor of the German Empire," and (indeed) someone else probably would have. It does not follow that the first Chancellor of the German Empire may not have been the first Chancellor of the German Empire&amp;mdash;that is (at least according to its surface-structure) a contradiction. Kripke argues that the way that proper names ''work'' is that when we make statements about what might or might not have been true of Bismarck, we are talking about what might or might not have been true of ''that particular person'' in various situations, whereas when we make statements about what might or might not have been true of, say, ''the first Chancellor of the German Empire'' we ''could'' be talking about what might or might not have been true of ''whoever'' would have happened to fill that office in those situations.

The "could" here is important to note: rigid designation is a property of the ''way terms are used'', not a property of ''the terms themselves'', and some philosophers, following [[Keith Donnellan]], have argued that a phrase such as "the first Chancellor of the German Empire" ''could'' be used rigidly, in sentences such as "the first Chancellor of the German Empire could have decided never to go into politics." Kripke himself doubted that there was any need to recognize rigid uses of definite descriptions, and argued that [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]]'s notion of [[scope (logic)|scope]] offered all that was needed to account for such sentences. But in either case, Kripke argued, nothing important in his account depends on the question. Whether definite descriptions can be used rigidly or not, they can at least ''sometimes'' be used non-rigidly, but a proper name ''can only be used rigidly''; the asymmetry, Kripke argues, demonstrates that no definite description could ''give the meaning'' of a proper name&amp;mdash;although it might be used to explain ''who'' a name refers to (that is, to "fix the referent" of the name).

==Essentialism==
In ''[[Naming and Necessity]]'', Kripke argues that [[proper name]]s and certain [[natural kind]] terms&amp;mdash;including biological [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxa]] and types of natural substances (most famously, "water" and "H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O") designate rigidly. He argues for a form of [[scientific essentialism]] not unlike Aristotelian essentialism. Essential properties are common to an object in all possible worlds, and so they pick out the same objects in all possible worlds - they rigidly designate.

==Causal-historical theory of reference==
Proper names rigidly designate for reasons that differ from natural kinds terms. The reason '[[Johnny Depp]]' refers to one particular person in all possible worlds is because some person initially gave the name to him by saying something like "Let's call our baby 'Johnny Depp'". This is called the initial baptism. This usage of 'Johnny Depp' for referring to some particular baby got passed on from person-to-person in a giant [[Causal theory of reference|causal and historical chain of events]]. That is why everybody calls Johnny Depp 'Johnny Depp'. Johnny's mother passed it onto her friends who passed it onto their friends who passed it onto their friends, and so on.

==Necessary identities==
{{see|Necessity of identity}}
One puzzling consequence of Kripke semantics is that identities involving rigid designators are necessary. If [[water]] is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, then water is ''necessarily'' H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. Since the terms 'water' and 'H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O' pick out the same object in every possible world, there is no possible world in which 'water' picks out something different from 'H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O'. Therefore, water is necessarily H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. It is possible, of course, that we are mistaken about the chemical composition of water, but that does not affect the necessity of identities. What is not being claimed is that water is necessarily H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, but ''conditionally'', ''if'' water is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (though we may not know this, it does not change the fact if it is true), then water is necessarily H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.

'''SABRE Research UK''' is a British [[Charitable organization|charity]] raising awareness of the need to remove [[bias]] from the conduct and [[Evaluation|scientific evaluation]] of [[animal research]]. DEBATE 
It addresses this issue by calling for [[systematic reviews]] of existing animal studies (published results of laboratory animal experiments). The charity was constituted in 2005 in response to disquiet about uninformed opinions about the scientific value of animal studies and dissatisfaction with [[attitude polarization|'polarised positions]] in the debate about animal research'. The charity found that neither the proponents of animal research nor its opponents were able to produce sufficiently sound scientific evidence in support of their opposing cases.

The charity is independent from [[political parties]], [[understanding animal research|animal research advocacy groups]], the [[pharmaceutical industry]], [[animal rights groups]] or any other vested interests. It does not take a position on the moral, welfare or ethical use of animals in research. Its interests lie in the [[Economic|economic costs]], the application and relevance of animal research to human health and how the results of animal experiments are analysed, evaluated and interpreted and the resulting data used to inform the design of [[clinical trials]].

== History ==

The formation of the charity followed the publication of an Education and Debate paper in the [[BMJ]] in 2004 which expressed concerns about the lack of scientific evidence to support the claims made by animal research advocates. The paper, itself a systematic review, was the first to call for systematic reviews of animal studies. It also called for the prospective registration of all animal research projects licensed by the [[Home Office]]. The authors were concerned that animal research is not conducted, analysed and reported (published) as rigorously as clinical research, which has reporting standards such as the [[Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials|CONSORT]] statement for [[randomised controlled trials|randomised controlled clinical trials]]. These measures are considered important as they promote higher standards of research conduct through higher reporting standards.&lt;ref&gt;Pound P. et al. Where is the evidence that animal research benefits humans? BMJ. 2004 Feb 28;328(7438):514-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 a report was published by the [[Nuffield Council on Bioethics]] which called for systematic reviews and [[meta-analyses]] to be carried out in order to ‘evaluate more fully the predictability and transferability of animal models.&lt;ref&gt;Nuffield Council on Bioethics. The ethics of research involving animals. 2005 http://www.nuffieldbioethics.org/animal-research&lt;/ref&gt; The report concluded that 'At present, there is a relatively limited number of useful systematic reviews and meta-reviews that address the question of the scientific validity of animal experiments and tests.’ The report recommended that the programme be funded by the [[Home Office]] in collaboration with major funders of research such as the [[Wellcome Trust]], the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|MRC]], the [[Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council |Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)]], animal protection groups and industry associations such as the [[Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry]] (ABPI)’.

A larger study was published in the BMJ in 2007 which drew attention to a lack of communication between animal researchers and clinical researchers and 'identified a gap in knowledge about the usefulness of the volume of animal studies that look at biological mechanisms of disease' and that 'more systematic reviews are needed for a quantitative appraisal of the concordance between animal and clinical trials.' The review reiterated earlier calls for the Home Office to undertake prospective registration of animal studies. The authors had found that the Home Office showed a lack of interest in the quality of record-keeping needed for preparing systematic reviews.&lt;ref&gt;Perel P. et al, Comparison of treatment effects between animal experiments and clinical trials: systematic review. BMJ 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2007 SABRE Research UK designed a Powerpoint presentation for the annual Festival of Science held by the [[British Association]] of Science in the United Kingdom. The presentation was given by [http://www.acsh.org/about/pageID.107/default.asp Professor Michael B Bracken] from the [[American Council on Science and Health]]. In the lecture he urged scientists to recognize the need for systematic reviews of animal studies.&lt;ref&gt;Drug trials put at risk from flawed animal testing. Telegraph Sept 2007. https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/3307040/Drug-trials-put-at-risk-by-flawed-animal-testing.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The charity states that it is generally believed by the public that animal research is only carried out providing:

* it leads to improvements in human health
* non-animal models and technologies are unavailable
* it is not duplicated unnecessarily
* it is not done for trivial and non-medical reasons
* it cannot be conducted ethically in humans

However, the charity cautions that because of biases in research, these conditions are not always met. Although it is claimed, by those with a vested interest, that animal experiments have led to developments in medicine the hypothesis that animals make reliable models of humans has never been tested and validated. But what we do know is that researchers have uncovered uncertainties and flaws in the way that much animal research is designed and how it is approved and evaluated and that it has harmed patients and likely to have diverted attention away from other more reliable methods of pre-clinical research. It also amounts to a substantial degree of research waste. &lt;ref&gt;http://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12910-015-0043-7&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Hackam DG, Redelmeier DA. Translation of research evidence from animals to humans. JAMA. 2006 Oct 11;296(14):1731-2. Review.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these questions serious doubts have been raised about the predictive value of animal studies for human health.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Matthews (scientist)|Matthews R A]]., Medical progress depends on animal models - doesn't it? J R Soc Med. 2008 Feb;101(2):95-8. Review&lt;/ref&gt; [[John P. A. Ioannidis|Professor John Ioannidis]] says of pre-clinical research 'Evidence-based medicine does not seem to have penetrated basic and preclinical science, while basic and preclinical research is often performed in a clinical and methodological vacuum.’&lt;ref&gt;[[John P.A. Ioannidis|Ioannidis J P]], Evolution and translation of research findings: from bench to where? PLoS Clin Trials. 2006 Nov 17;1(7):e36&lt;/ref&gt;

== SABRE's priorities for research involving animals ==

* Implementation of the 10Rs+ Strategy to include a full programme of [[Systematic reviews]] of existing animal studies before funding any new animal research. http://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12910-015-0043-7
* Prospective registration of animal studies (to be maintained by the [[Home Office]]) with adequate details recorded to inform subsequent systematic reviews.
* Adoption and implementation of the new guidelines ([http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1000412 The ARRIVE Guidelines]) on reporting animal research, by authors, journal editors, peer reviewers, and funding bodies.
* A large-scale programme of systematic reviews of existing animal studies (the published results of laboratory animal experiments) to be conducted to assess and monitor the value of animal research to the promotion of human health.

== Summary ==

It is now increasingly widely accepted that [[systematic reviews]] of existing research are needed to assess the value of most scientific research. The results of the reviews form a body of evidence that other researchers, health economists and policy makers can use to inform further research and financial and economic decision-making.

Systematic reviews provide [[transparency (behavior)|transparency]] and [[accountability]] of research and help to advance [[medical research]] by building a more reliable [[evidence-based medicine|evidence-base]] derived from the results of the reviews. It is important that sound and [[rigorous]] evidence is cumulated and made available through [http://www.srsm.org/ '''research synthesis'''].

SABRE Research UK believes that systematic reviews of the data from existing animal studies will help to ensure that only the highest quality pre-clinical research relevant to human health will be done and made available to clinical research and research programmes. Systematic reviews are essential in protecting the health and safety of [[patients]] and [[Phase 1 clinical trial|research volunteers]].

== Notes ==
It is in the interest of patients' organisations, research volunteers and medical charities to support the 10Rs+ Strategy that SABRE Research has proposed. Details are found in this paper: http://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12910-015-0043-7

'''Sybille Haynes''', {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|MBE|size=100%|sep=,}} (''[[née]]'' '''Overhoff'''; born 3 July 1926) is a British expert on [[Etruscology]]. She grew up and was educated in Germany and Austria before moving to the UK in the 1950s. She worked with Etruscan artefacts at the [[British Museum]] for many years as well as publishing numerous books, for fellow scholars and also for the general public. In the 1980s she joined the Centre for the Study of Greek and Roman Antiquity at [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford]].

== Early life and education ==
Born Sybille Overhoff on 3 July 1926 to Edith ''née'' Kloeppel, her German mother, and Julius Overhoff, her Austrian father, she was one of five siblings including her twin sister [[Elfriede Knauer]], an archaeologist.&lt;ref name=EK&gt;[https://amphilsoc.org/sites/default/files/proceedings/1553KnauerBio1550309.pdf American Philosophical Society biography of Elfriede Knauer] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170811075454/https://amphilsoc.org/sites/default/files/proceedings/1553KnauerBio1550309.pdf |date=2017-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She grew up in a cultured family in Berlin, Frankfurt and Austria but her schooling was interrupted by the [[Nazi]] regime. She had to join Nazi youth organisations and spent a year doing compulsory labour in harsh conditions.&lt;ref name=EK/&gt; After the war things remained difficult for some time and she studied Chinese while waiting for Frankfurt University to reopen in 1947. However, she had always been interested in the antiquities collected by her maternal great-grandfather, the sculptor and art historian {{Interlanguage link multi|Melchior zur Straßen|de}}, and had a long-standing wish to study classical archaeology, and in particular, Etruscology.&lt;ref name=SH/&gt; Once at the [[Goethe University Frankfurt]] she studied classical archaeology, ancient history, art history and ethnology and found vacation work in museums in Paris, Rome, and London before graduating ''[[summa cum laude]]'' in December 1950.&lt;ref name=SH&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/pdf/0-Prelims-pp.pdf Etruscan by Definition: Papers in honour of Sybille Haynes, MBE, British Museum Press 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; She went on to write a thesis on Etruscan bronze mirrors, supervised and encouraged by [[Guido Kaschnitz von Weinberg|Guido von Kaschnitz]].

== British Museum ==
[[File:Etruscan symposium sarcophagus.jpg|thumb|[[Sarcophagus]] from the Sperandio [[necropolis]] near [[Perugia]], discussed in Haynes' ''Etruscan Civilisation''.]]
While she was helping at the British Museum in 1950, where the Greek and Roman department had suffered severe bomb damage, she met [[Denys Haynes]] (1913-1994), later Keeper of Greek and Roman Antiquities, whom she married in January 1951. She had also come to know the previous Keeper, [[Bernard Ashmole]], who offered her a voluntary position in the department where her work included answering questions about Etruscan subjects and handling correspondence in German and Italian. She described this as an opportunity to study and learn.&lt;ref name=SH/&gt; Amongst her writings were two booklets for the museum on Etruscan bronze utensils and Etruscan sculpture. In 1985 she published Etruscan Bronzes, an Etruscan novel called The Augur's Daughter in 1987 (first published in German in 1981) and Etruscan Civilization in 2000 (and an enlarged German edition in 2005). She also published regularly in international journals and was made a foreign member of the ''Istituto di Studi Etruschi ed Italici'' in 1965. In 1976, the year she was awarded an [[MBE]], Haynes was responsible for the opening of the first ever Etruscan gallery in the classical department of the British Museum.&lt;ref name=SH/&gt;  In 1981 she was honoured by the Order of the ''Dignitari dell'Ombra della Sera'' in [[Volterra]].

== Later career ==
In 1985 she moved to Oxford where she was invited to join [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford]] and the Centre for the Study of Greek and Roman Antiquity. In the same year she was made a corresponding member of the [[Deutsches Archäologisches Institut]]. In 2000 her book, ''Etruscan Civilization: A Cultural History'' was very well-received, and has been described as "definitive and comprehensive"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-roman-archaeology/article/honoring-sybille-haynes-at-the-british-museum-swaddlingjudith-and-perkinsphilip-edd-etruscan-by-definition-the-cultural-regional-and-personal-identity-of-the-etruscans-papers-in-honour-of-sybille-haynes-mbe-british-museum-research-publication-no-173-london2009-distributed-by-oxbow-books-pp-viii-111-many-figs-including-colour-isbn-978-086159-173-2-issn-1747-3640-60/CA093E536E7E9865014673E05F05A1A2 Nancy de Grummond, Review of 'Honoring Sybille Haynes at the British Museum', ''Journal of Roman Archaeology'', Volume 24, 2011, pp. 523-526]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as "authoritative, precise, engaging and articulate".&lt;ref&gt;[http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2001/2001-10-19.html Richard De Puma, Review of ''Etruscan Civilization'' in ''Bryn Mawr Classical Review'' 19 Oct 2001]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neil MacGregor]], while director of the British Museum, called Haynes an "Etruscologist of international repute" in the introduction to a 2011 [[festschrift]].&lt;ref name=SH/&gt; A Sybille Haynes Lecturership in Etruscan and Italic Archaeology at Somerville College [[Oxford University]] was created in 2013, and the university hosts a recently established annual Sybille Haynes lecture series open to the public.

'''Veritism''' was a socio-philosophical [[ideology]] promoted by the "Veritism Foundation" (apparently now defunct). It advocates that man has been presented with no conclusive evidence lending credence to the existence of a specific [[deity]], or supreme entity and thus has no justification for reaching any kind of conclusions on the nature of such a being other than that (as represented by humanity's current state) it is a benign force.

==Basic Propositions==

===On History===
Veritism proposes that man has been engaged in an unfruitful search for truth since his creation.
Veritism also emphasizes that some, not having found truth, or lacking direction in their own lives, have rejected the existence of [[absolute truth]], thus embracing [[atheistic]], [[Nihilism|nihilistic]] ideologies.
History is a crucial aspect in Veritism, as most of Veritistic theory rests upon the conclusion that truth must be revealed unto humanity by an external means. The past lends credence to this conclusion, as throughout human history multiple theories and ideologies have been discarded. Essentially, philosophy is a dynamic subject, constantly in a state of change: conclusions are eternally tested, challenged, and discarded, only to be quickly and efficiently replaced by those seemingly more plausible.

===On Ultimate Truth===
Veritism suggests that humanity may only theorize upon non-observable studies. Man can draw conclusions concerning solid, physical sciences such as mathematics or chemistry. But he cannot claim he has undeniably and irrefutably answered questions relative to philosophy. Thus the only logical [[Absolute (philosophy)|absolute]] concerning [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] philosophical truth is that it simply does not exist. Yet many discard this statement, saying that it denies its own antecedent (one claims an absolute when he denies the existence of absolute truth). Yet upon examination of this particular antecedent we find that it is specific to a certain kind of truth, and thus claims only that truths asserted from a certain medium cannot be conclusive. As an example, any type of personal [[revelation]] or "vision" cannot be deemed as legitimate, as there is ultimately no way to prove that it was of divine cause or of personal accord. In Veritism the question becomes "what is the nature of truths presented?", "what is their claim?" and "is that claim plausible?"

===On Religion===
Veritism dismisses [[organized religion]] or any claim to ultimate truth as ignorant and without grounds.

===On Reality===
A veritistic view of reality is rather basic. That which can be perceived by the five senses is that which exists.

===On Ethics===
Veritistic [[ethics]] would advocate that humans have an inherent view of that which is right or wrong. This is demonstrated in law and government. The only humans lacking any type of self [[morals]] or ethical inclination are those with a mental or psychological dysfunction. Veritism consequently suggests that there are numerous cultural factors which influence behavior concerning ethics, sometimes in a negative way.
Veritistic thinking also attributes action to negative consequence. Some may subscribe to a religion simply because they fear a negative [[afterlife]]. Those who are truly moral, ethical people are those who do good with no ultimate reward, simply because it is the right thing to do.

Dr. '''W. D. Wright''' (born 1936) is a [[Professors in the United States#Professor emeritus and emerita|professor emeritus]] of history at [[Southern Connecticut State University]] and the author of seven books on race and racism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wdwrightbooks.com/Home_Page.html Homepage, Dr. W. D. Wright website.]&lt;/ref&gt;

He earned a Ph.D. from [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|State University of New York at Buffalo]] where he was influenced by [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], referring to himself as a Du Boisian historical sociologist. He later published his dissertation "The Socialist Analysis of W. E. B. Du Bois."

==Early years==
Wright, born 1936, was raised during the depression in [[Michigan City, Indiana]], one of eight children. His father, Charles Noble Wright, worked as a riveter for the [[Pullman Company|Pullman Train Company]]. His mother, Harriet Elizabeth Wright, was the first black female to graduate high school in Michigan City, Indiana. Wright's great grandmother, Elizabeth Downey, was a slave until the age of 12 in [[Virginia]], when she was emancipated under the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] in approximately 1863.

Wright was a childhood friend of [[Richard G. Hatcher]], the first black mayor in Indiana. Hatcher often delivered speeches alongside [[Martin Luther King]], [[Robert F. Kennedy]], the Rev. [[Jesse Jackson]], and other historic proponents of the [[civil rights movement]].

==Racism in America==
Wright contends that historians and intellectuals have failed to understand the difference between race and racism, which has in turn impaired their ability to understand who [[Black people]] are in America. He argues that [[African American|Black Americans]] are to be distinguished from other categories of black people in the country: black Africans, [[Caribbean|West Indians]], or Hispanics. While Black people are members of the black race, as are other groups of people, they are a distinct [[ethnic group]] of that race. This conceptual failure has hampered the ability of historians to define Black experience in America and to study it in the most accurate, authentic, and realistic manner possible.

Wright lectures often about how [[white people]] have been affected by their own [[racism]] and how it impacts upon relations between blacks and whites and the United States. He asserts that since the late 17th century, most Whites have been afflicted by their own racism, as evidenced by considerable delusional thinking, dehumanization, and alienation from America.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} White people have created and maintained a White racist America, which is the antithesis of liberty, equality, justice, and freedom; Black people continue to be the primary victims of this culture.

==The Black experience==
Wright describes the Black experience in America as reflecting some of the richest dimensions of the human experience and human existence and also some of its most oppressive and wretched realities. Black people are a people "up from slavery" who survived slavery, developed during slavery, and developed after slavery-all great historical achievements.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Today there are many Black intellectuals who do not think of Black people as a people and have no wish to do so. They think of themselves as individuals and look upon Blacks that way as well. And this idea is espoused by more people than just the Black conservatives, although they have made a fetish of this kind of conception and Black social response in America.

Black intellectuals are mainly from the Black middle-class... [which] has lost—if it has not abandoned altogether—its historical mission, which was to help Black people as a people, as well as Black individuals, to advance and to be free in America. – W.D. Wright, excerpt from ''Crisis Of The Black Intellectual''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
