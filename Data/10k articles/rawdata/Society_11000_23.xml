The '''Aimoré''' ''(Aymore, Aimboré)'' are one of several [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|South American peoples]] of eastern Brazil called '''Botocudo''' in Portuguese (from ''botoque'', a plug), in allusion to the wooden disks or [[tembetá]]s worn in their lips and ears. Some called themselves '''Nac-nanuk''' or '''Nac-poruk''', meaning "sons of the soil".&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;  The last Aimoré group to retain their language are the '''Krenak'''.  The other peoples called Botocudo were the [[Xokleng people|Xokleng]] and [[Xeta people|Xeta]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ling.fi/Entradas%20diccionario/Dic=Botocudo.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Brazilian chief who was presented to King Henry VIII in 1532 wore small bones hung from his cheeks and from the lower lip a semi-precious stone the size of a pea. These were the marks of great bravery.  When the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] adventurer [[Vasco Fernandes Coutinho, captain of Espírito Santo|Vasco Fernando Coutinho]] reached the east coast of Brazil in 1535, he erected a fort at the head of [[Espírito Santo Bay]] to defend himself against the Aimorés and other tribes.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

==Distribution and fate==
[[Image:E11 p9.jpg|thumb|upright|right|300px|Botocudos by Debret]]
The tribe's original territory was in [[Espírito Santo]], and reached inland to the headwaters of the Rio Grande ([[Belmonte, Bahia|Belmonte]]) and [[Doce River]] on the eastern slopes of the [[Espinhaço Mountains]]. The Botocudos were gradually expelled by European colonists westward beyond the [[Serra dos Aimorés]] into [[Minas Gerais]]. It was in the latter district that at the close of the 18th century they came into collision with the Europeans, who were attracted there by the [[diamond]] fields.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

At the end of the 19th century many Botocudo tribes still existed, numbering between 13,000 and 14,000 individuals. During the earlier frontier wars of 1790-1820, every effort was made to destroy them. [[Smallpox]] was deliberately spread among them; poisoned food was scattered in the forests; by such infamous means, the coast districts about Rio Doce and Belmonte were cleared, and one Portuguese commander boasted that he had either slain with his own hands or ordered to be butchered many hundreds of them.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Paul Ehrenreich estimated their population at 5,000 in 1884. As of April 1939, only 68 Botocudo were alive in Eastern Brazil. They were divided into two groups. The first group numbered 10 people (belonging to Naknyanuk, Arana and Poyica tribes) and lived near [[Itambacuri]]. The second group were divided into two bands residing at [[Guido Marliere]], on the Doce River. One band consisted of 8 survivors from the Naktun, Nakpie, Convugn and Miyã-Yirúgn tribes. Another band consisted of around 50 Nakrehe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nimuendajú|first1=Curt|title=Social Organization and Beliefs of the Botocudo of Eastern Brazil|journal=Southwestern Journal of Anthropology|date=1946|volume=2|issue=1|pages=93–115|doi=10.2307/3628738|jstor=3628738|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, only a few tribes remain, almost all of them in rural villages and the [[Indigenous territory (Brazil)|indigenous territory]]. The last remnants of the Eastern Botocudo are the Krenak. In 2010, there were 350 Krenak living in the state of Minas Gerais.&lt;ref name=krenak/&gt;

==Subdivisions==
[[File:Botokuden-Hunter.jpg|thumb|Botocuden hunters (1928)]]

The Aimoré consisted of dozens of tribes, who spoke either dialects or closely related languages. Some of the important tribes are:

* Prajé or Pragé - Pernambuco
* Takruk-krak or Takrukrak
* Crecmum or Krekmún - Bahia
* Etwét or Ituêto - Minas Gerais
* Futi-krak
* [[Gueren language|Gerén]] or Gueren - Bahia
* Gut-Craque or Gutucrac - Minas Gerais
* Mekmek - Minas Gerais
* Minyã Yirúgn or Minhagirun
* Minhagiran - Espírito Santo
* Nakrehê or Naque Erehê / Nacrehe - Minas Gerais &amp; Espirito Santo
* Naque-namu
* Naque-Nhepe
* Naknianuk or Naknyanúk / Nacnhanuc - Minas Gerais

==Customs==
[[File:Rugendas indiobotocudo.gif|thumb|left|Botocudo man, drawn by [[Johann Moritz Rugendas]]]]
[[File:Botokuden-Girls - Kopie.jpg|thumb|Botocuden girls (1928)]]

The Botocudos were [[nomadic]] [[hunter-gatherers]], wandering naked in the woods and living from the forest. Their implements and domestic utensils were all of wood; their only weapons were reed [[spear]]s and [[bow (weapon)|bows and arrows]]. Their dwellings were rough shelters of leaf and bast, seldom {{convert|4|ft}} high. Their only musical instrument was a small [[bamboo]] [[nose flute]]. They attributed all the blessings of life to the day-fire (Sun) and all evil to night-fire (Moon). At the graves of the dead, they kept fires burning for some days to scare away evil spirits, and, during storms and [[eclipse]]s, arrows were shot into the sky to drive away demons.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The most conspicuous feature of the Botocudos was the ''tembeitera'', a wooden plug or disk which is worn in the lower lip and the lobe of the ear. This disk, made of the specially light and carefully dried wood of the [[barriguda tree]] (''[[Chorisia ventricosa]]''), which was called by the natives themselves ''embur'', whence [[Augustin Saint-Hilaire]] suggested that this could be the probable derivation of their name Aimboré (1830). It is worn only in the under-lip, now chiefly by women, but formerly by men also. The operation for preparing the lip begins often as early as the eighth year, when an initial boring is made by a hard pointed stick, and gradually extended by the insertion of larger and larger disks or plugs, sometimes at last as much as 10&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter. Notwithstanding the lightness of the wood the tembeitera weighs down the lip, which at first sticks out horizontally and at last becomes a mere ring of skin around the wood. Ear-plugs are also worn, of such size as to distend the lobe down to the shoulders. Ear-ornaments of like nature are common in south and even [[Central America]], at least as far north as [[Honduras]], as described by [[Christopher Columbus]] when he discovered this latter country during his fourth voyage (1502). This ornament also named part of the [[Peru]] seaboard as [[Costa de la Oreja]], from the conspicuously distended ears of the native [[Chimú]]. Early Spanish explorers also gave the name Orejones or big-eared to several Amazon tribes.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

{{blp unsourced section|date=August 2017}}
Ayman al-Zawahiri was born in 1951 in the neighborhood of [[Maadi]], Cairo, in the then [[Kingdom of Egypt]], to Mohammed Rabie al-Zawahiri and Umayma Azzam.

====Close family====
The al-Zawahiri family was considered "[[upper middle class|distinguished]]" &lt;ref name="Ayman al-Zawahiri Fast Facts"&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2012/12/14/world/ayman-al-zawahiri---fast-facts/ Ayman al-Zawahiri Fast Facts] [[CNN]] June 7, 2016 Retrieved 2017-02-15&lt;/ref&gt; while they lived in [[Maadi]].  Al-Zawahiri's parents both came from prosperous families. Al-Zawahiri's father, Mohammed Rabie al-Zawahiri, came from a large family of doctors and scholars. Mohammed Rabie became a [[surgeon]] and a professor of pharmacy&lt;ref name="Ayman al-Zawahiri Fast Facts"/&gt; at [[Cairo University]]. Ayman's mother, Umayma Azzam, came from a wealthy, politically active clan. Ayman has said that he has a deep affection for his mother. Her brother, Mahfouz Azzam, became a role model for Ayman as a teenager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[The Looming Tower]]|author=[[Lawrence Wright]]|publisher=Knopf|year=2006|isbn=0-375-41486-X|pages=Chapter 2|nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ayman has a younger brother, [[Muhammad al-Zawahiri]], and a twin sister, Heba Mohamed al-Zawahiri.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} Al-Zawahiri's sister, Heba Mohamed al-Zawahiri, became a professor of [[Oncology|medical oncology]] at [[National Cancer Institute Egypt|the National Cancer Institute, Cairo University]].

====Youth====
Ayman al-Zawahiri was reportedly a studious youth. Ayman excelled in school, loved poetry, and "hated violent sports" — which he thought were "inhumane." Al-Zawahiri studied medicine at [[Cairo University]] and graduated in 1974 with ''[[Academic grading in Egypt|gayyid giddan]]''. Following that, he served three years as a surgeon in the [[Egyptian Army]] after which he established a clinic near his parents in Maadi.&lt;ref name=wrightp42/&gt; In 1978, he also earned a [[master's degree]] in [[surgery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[The Osama bin Laden I Know]] |author=Bergen, Peter L. |publisher=Free Press

Al-Zawahiri participated in [[Youth activism]] as a student. He became both quite pious and political, under the influence of his uncle Mahfouz Azzam, and lecturer Mostafa Kamel Wasfi.&lt;ref name="monty"&gt;[[Monstasser el-Zayyat|El-Zayyat, Montasser]], "Qaeda", 2004. tr. by Ahmed Fakry&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Sayyid Qutb]] preached that to restore Islam and free Muslims, a vanguard of true Muslims modeling itself after the original [[Companions of the Prophet]] had to be developed.&lt;ref&gt;Qutb, ''Milestones'', pp. 16, 20 (pp. 17–18).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Joins the ''Muslim Brotherhood''====
{{See also|Sayyid Qutb}}

By the age of 14, al-Zawahiri had joined the [[Muslim Brotherhood]]. The following year the [[Egyptian government]] executed Qutb for [[Conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]], and al-Zawahiri, along with four other secondary school students, helped form an "[[Terrorist cell|underground cell]] devoted to overthrowing the government and establishing an Islamist state." It was at this early age that al-Zawahiri developed a [[Missionary|mission]] in life, "to put [[Sayyid Qutb|Qutb]]'s vision into action."&lt;ref&gt;Wright, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; His cell eventually merged with others to form al-Jihad or [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]].&lt;ref name=wrightp42&gt;Wright, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage and children===
Ayman al-Zawahiri has been married at least four times. His wives include Azza Ahmed Nowari and Umaima Hassan.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

In 1978, al-Zawahiri married his first wife, Azza Ahmed Nowari, a student at Cairo University who was studying [[philosophy]].&lt;ref name="monty"/&gt; Their wedding, which was held at the Continental Hotel in Opera Square,&lt;ref name="monty"/&gt; was very conservative, with separate areas for both men and women, and no music, photographs, or light-hearted humour.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, pp. 43–44.&lt;/ref&gt; Many years later, when the United States attacked Afghanistan following the [[September 11 attacks]] in October 2001, Azza apparently had no idea that al-Zawahiri had supposedly been a [[jihad]]i emir (commander) for the last decade.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, p. 370.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2012, one of Zawahiri's four wives, Umaima Hassan, released a statement on the internet congratulating the role played by Muslim [[women in the Arab Spring]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Henderson |first=Barney |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/al-qaeda/9320323/Al-Qaeda-statement-by-Ayman-al-Zawahiris-wife-released.html |title=Al-Qaeda statement by Ayman al-Zawahiri's wife released |publisher=Telegraph |date= June 8, 2012|accessdate=2012-12-13 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Zawahiri and his wife, Azza, had four daughters, Fatima (born 1981), Umayma (born 1983), Nabila (born 1986), and Khadiga (born 1987), and a son, Mohammed (also born in 1987; the twin brother of Khadiga), who was a "delicate, well-mannered boy" and "the pet of his older sisters," subject to teasing and [[bullying]] in a traditional all-male environment, who preferred to "stay at home and help his mother."&lt;ref&gt;Wright, pp. 254–5.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, ten years after the birth of Mohammed, Azza gave birth to their fifth daughter, Aisha, who had [[Down syndrome]]. In February 2004, [[Abu Zubaydah]] was [[waterboarded]] and subsequently stated that [[Abu Turab Al-Urduni]] had married one of al-Zawahiri's daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Intelligence report, interrogation of [[Abu Zubaydah]], 18 February 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first half of 2005, one of Al-Zawahiri's three surviving wives gave birth to a daughter, named Nawwar.&lt;ref name="berg"&gt;Bergen, Peter. "The Osama bin Laden I Know", 2006. p. 367&lt;/ref&gt;

Ayman al-Zawahiri's first wife Azza and two of their six children, Mohammad and Aisha, were killed in an air strike on [[Afghanistan]] by US forces in late December 2001, following the [[September 11 attacks]] on the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-202_162-20071562.html |title=For al-Zawahiri, anti-U.S. fight is personal |publisher=CBS News |date=2011-06-16 |accessdate=2012-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cnn: Jihadist websites"/&gt;  After an American aerial bombardment of a Taliban-controlled building at [[Gardez, Afghanistan|Gardez]], Azza was pinned under debris of a guesthouse roof. Concerned for her modesty, she "refused to be excavated" because "men would see her face" and she died from her injuries the following day. Her son, Mohammad, was also killed outright in the same house. Her four-year-old daughter with Down syndrome, Aisha, had not been hurt by the bombing, but died from exposure in the cold night while Afghan rescuers tried to save Azza.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, p. 371.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Ayman al-Zawahiri worked in the medical field as a [[surgeon]]. In 1985, al-Zawahiri went to Saudi Arabia on [[Hajj]] and stayed to practice medicine in [[Jeddah]] for a year.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; As a reportedly qualified surgeon, when his organization merged with [[Osama bin Laden#Formation and structuring of al-Qaeda|bin Laden's]] al-Qaeda, he became bin Laden's personal advisor and physician. He had first met bin Laden in [[Jeddah]] in 1986.&lt;ref name="Atkins2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Atkins|first=Stephen E.|title=The 9/11 Encyclopedia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PDDIgWRN_HQC&amp;pg=PA456|accessdate=6 May 2011|date=31 May 2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-59884-921-9|page=456}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, Ayman al-Zawahiri also traveled to [[Peshawar, Pakistan]], where he worked in a [[Red Crescent]] hospital treating wounded refugees. There he became friends with [[Ahmed Khadr]], and the two shared a number of conversations about the need for Islamic government and the needs of the Afghan people.&lt;ref name="child"&gt;[[Michelle Shephard]], "Guantanamo's Child", 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/zawahiri.htm |title=Ayman al-Zawahiri |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date= |accessdate=2012-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, al-Zawahiri traveled to the United States, where he addressed several [[California]] [[mosque]]s under his ''Abdul Mu'iz'' [[Pseudonym#Concealing identity|pseudonym]], relying on his credentials from the Kuwaiti [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Crescent]] to raise money for Afghan children who had been injured by Soviet [[land mine]]s—he only raised $2000.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Militant activity==

===Assassination plots===
{{Main|Assassination}}

====Egypt====
In 1981, Al-Zawahiri was one of hundreds arrested following the [[assassination of President Anwar Sadat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/mohamed-al-zawahiri-denies-being-arrested-syria | title =Mohamed al-Zawahiri denies being arrested in Syria | author =''[[Egypt Independent]]'' | date =May 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the plan was derailed when authorities were alerted to Al-Jihad's plan by the arrest of an [[operative tactical|operative]] carrying crucial information, in February 1981. President [[Anwar Sadat|Sadat]] ordered the roundup of more than 1500 people, including many Al-Jihad members, but missed a cell in the military led by Lieutenant [[Khalid Islambouli]], who succeeded in assassinating Sadat during a military parade that October.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; His lawyer, [[Montasser el-Zayat]], said that Zawahiri was tortured in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bowcott |first=Owen |title=Torture trail to September 11: A two-part investigation into state brutality opens with a look at how the violent interrogation of Islamist extremists hardened their views, helped to create al-Qaida and now, more than ever, is fueling fundamentalist hatred |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=24 January 2003 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/alqaida/story/0,12469,881096,00.html |accessdate=29 August 2006 |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060304031513/http://www.guardian.co.uk/alqaida/story/0%2C12469%2C881096%2C00.html |archivedate=March 4, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book, ''Al-Zawahiri as I Knew Him'', Al-Zayat maintains that under torture by the Egyptian police, following his arrest in connection with the murder of Sadat in 1981, Al-Zawahiri revealed the hiding place of [[Essam al-Qamari]], a key member of the Maadi cell of al-Jihad, which led to Al-Qamari's "arrest and eventual execution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1080/714005636 | last = Raphaeli | first = Nimrod | title = Ayman Muhammad Rabi' Al-Zawahiri: The Making of an Arch Terrorist | journal=[[Terrorism and Political Violence]] |date=Winter 2002|pages = 1–22 | volume=14|issue = 4}}

&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, al-Zawahiri's and Egyptian Islamic Jihad's ([[Egyptian Islamic Jihad|EIJ]]) connection with [[Iran]] may have led to a suicide bombing in an attempt on the life of [[Ministry of Interior (Egypt)|Egyptian Interior Minister]] Hasan al-Alfi, the man heading the effort to quash the campaign of Islamist killings in Egypt. It failed, as did an attempt to assassinate Egyptian prime minister [[Atef Sidqi]] three months later. The bombing of Sidqi's car injured 21 Egyptians and killed a  schoolgirl, Shayma Abdel-Halim. It followed two years of killings by another Islamist group, [[al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya]], that had killed over 200 people. Her funeral became a public spectacle, with her coffin carried through the streets of [[Cairo]] and crowds shouting, "Terrorism is the enemy of God!"&lt;ref name=Wright186&gt;Wright, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; The police arrested 280 more of al-Jihad's members and executed six.

For their leading role in anti-Egyptian Government attacks in the 1990s, al-Zawahiri and his brother Muhammad al-Zawahiri were sentenced to death in the 1999 Egyptian case of the [[Returnees from Albania]].

====Pakistan====
The 1995 [[Attack on the Egyptian Embassy in Pakistan|attack on the Egyptian embassy in Islamabad]], Pakistan, was the [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]]'s first success under Zawahiri's leadership, but Bin Laden had disapproved of the operation. The bombing [[Social alienation|alienated]] Pakistan, which was "the best route into Afghanistan".&lt;ref&gt;Wright, ''Looming Towers'', 2006, p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=May 2011|reason=incomplete and run-on sentence, needs rewrite including source of quote.}}

In July 2007, Al-Zawahiri supplied direction for the [[Lal Masjid siege]], codename Operation Silence. This was the first confirmed time that Al-Zawahiri was taking militant steps against the Pakistan Government and guiding Islamic militants against the State of Pakistan. The [[Pakistan Army]] troops and Special Service Group taking control of the [[Red Mosque|Lal Masjid ("Red Mosque")]] in [[Islamabad]] found letters from al-Zawahiri directing [[Islamic militants]] [[Abdul Rashid Ghazi]] and [[Abdul Aziz Ghazi]], who ran the mosque and adjacent [[madrasah]]. This conflict resulted in 100 deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article2076013.ece|title=The Times &amp; The Sunday Times|publisher=|accessdate=April 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 27, 2007, al-Zawahiri was also implicated in the assassination of former Pakistani Prime Minister [[Benazir Bhutto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adnkronos.com/AKI/English/Security/?id=1.0.1710322437 |title=Pakistan: Al-Qaeda claims Bhutto's death |publisher=Adnkronos Security |date=2003-04-07 |accessdate=2012-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sudan====
In 1994, the sons of [[Ahmad Salama Mabruk]] and [[Mohammed Sharaf]] were executed under al-Zawahiri's leadership for betraying [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]]; the militants were ordered to leave the Sudan.&lt;ref&gt;al-Shafey, Mohammed.

On October 10, 2001, al-Zawahiri appeared on the initial list of the U.S. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]'s top 22 [[FBI Most Wanted Terrorists|Most Wanted Terrorists]], which was released to the public by U.S. President [[George W. Bush]]. In early November 2001, the [[Taliban]] government announced they were bestowing official Afghan [[citizenship]] on him, as well as Bin Laden, [[Mohammed Atef]], [[Saif al-Adl]], and Shaykh [[Asim Abdulrahman]].&lt;ref&gt;[[The Hindu]], [http://www.hinduonnet.com/2001/11/10/stories/03100007.htm Taliban grants Osama citizenship], November 9, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organizations===

====Egyptian Islamic Jihad====
Ayman al-Zawahiri was previously the second and last "[[emir]]" of the [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]], having succeeded [[Abbud al-Zumar]] in the latter role when Egyptian authorities sentenced al-Zumar to [[life imprisonment]]. Ayman al-Zawahiri eventually became one of [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]]'s leading organizers and recruiters. Zawahiri's hope was to recruit military officers and accumulate weapons, waiting for the right moment to launch "a complete overthrow of the existing order."&lt;ref name=wrightp49&gt;Wright, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Strategist|Chief strategist]] of Al-Jihad was Aboud al-Zumar, a colonel in the military intelligence whose plan was to kill the main leaders of the country, capture the headquarters of the army and State Security, the telephone exchange building, and of course the radio and television building, where news of the Islamic revolution would then be broadcast, unleashing – he expected – "a popular uprising against secular authority all over the country."&lt;ref name=wrightp49/&gt;

====Maktab al-Khadamat====
{{See also|Black Standard}}

In [[Peshawar]], he met up with [[Osama bin Laden]], who was running a base for ''[[mujahideen]]'' called [[Maktab al-Khadamat]] (MAK); founded by the [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] Sheikh [[Abdullah Yusuf Azzam]]. The radical position of al-Zawahiri and the other militants of Al-Jihad put them at odds with Sheikh Azzam, with whom they competed for bin Laden's financial resources.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; Zawahiri carried two false passports, a Swiss one in the name of Amin Uthman and a Dutch one in the name of Mohmud Hifnawi.&lt;ref name="csisJaballah"&gt;[[Canadian Security Intelligence Service]], [http://cas-ncr-nter03.cas-satj.gc.ca/rss/Jaballah.pdf Summary of the Security Intelligence Report concerning Mahmoud Jaballah]{{Dead link|date=August 2015}}, February 22, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

British journalist [[Jason Burke]] wrote: "Al-Zawahiri ran his own operation during the Afghan war, bringing in and training volunteers from the Middle East. Some of the $500 million the [[CIA]] poured into Afghanistan reached his group."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Frankenstein the CIA created |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/jan/17/yemen.islam |work=The Guardian |date=January 17, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, al-Zawahiri formally merged the [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]] into al-Qaeda. According to reports by a former al-Qaeda member, he has worked in the al-Qaeda organization since its inception and was a senior member of the group's ''[[shura]]'' council. He was often described as a "lieutenant" to Osama bin Laden, though bin Laden's chosen biographer has referred to him as the "real brains" of al-Qaeda.&lt;ref name="CSM1"&gt;{{cite web |first=Scott |last=Baldauf |title=The 'cave man' and Al Qaeda |publisher=Christian Science Monitor |date=October 31, 2001 |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2001/1031/p6s1-wosc.html |accessdate=April 17, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080328031436/http://www.csmonitor.com/2001/1031/p6s1-wosc.html| archivedate= March 28, 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 23, 1998, al-Zawahiri issued a joint [[Fatwā|fatwa]] with [[Osama bin Laden]] under the title "[[World Islamic Front|World Islamic Front Against Jews and Crusaders]]". Zawahiri, not bin Laden, is thought to have been the actual author of the fatwa.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bin Laden and al-Zawahiri organized an al-Qaeda congress on June 24, 1998. A week prior to the beginning of the conference, a group of well-armed assistants to al-Zawahiri had left by jeeps in the direction of Herat. Following the instructions of their patron, in the town of Koh-i-Doshakh, they met three unknown Slavic-looking men who had arrived from Russia via Iran. After their arrival in Kandahar, they split up. One of the Russians was directly escorted to al-Zawahiri and he did not participate in the conference. [[Western world|Western]] [[military intelligence]] succeeded in acquiring photographs of him, but he disappeared for six years. According to Axis Globe, in 2004, when Qatar and the U.S. investigated Russian embassy officials whom the United Arab Emirates had arrested in connection to the murder of [[Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev]] in Qatar, computer software precisely established that a man who had walked to the Russian embassy in Doha was the same one who visited al-Zawahiri prior to the Al-Qaida conference.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/5rOeSEaw1?url=http://www.axisglobe.com/article.asp?article=252 Russian Secret Services' Links With Al-Qaeda].

=====Emergence as al-Qaeda's chief commander=====
On April 30, 2009, the [[U.S. State Department]] reported that al-Zawahiri had emerged as [[al-Qaeda]]'s operational and strategic commander&lt;ref name=Ay1le&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/us_world/2009/04/30/2009-04-30_al_qaeda_no_2_calls_the_shots.html | location=New York | work=Daily News | title=Al Qaeda No. 2 Ayman al-Zawahiri calls the shots, says State Department | date=April 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that Osama bin Laden was now only the ideological figurehead of the organization.&lt;ref name=Ay1le /&gt; However, after the 2011 death of bin Laden, a senior U.S. intelligence official was quoted as saying intelligence gathered in the raid showed that bin Laden remained deeply involved in planning: “This compound (where bin Laden was killed) in [[Abbottabad]] was an active [[Command and control|command-and-control]] center for al-Qaeda’s leader. He was active in operational planning and in driving [[military tactics|tactical decisions]]  within al-Qaeda.”&lt;ref name=null&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0511/54508.html | location=Washington | work=Politico | title=Osama Bin Laden was still in control, U.S. says | date=May 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the death of bin Laden, former U.S. Deputy National Security Advisor for Combating Terrorism [[Juan Zarate]] said that al-Zawahiri would "clearly assume the mantle of leadership" of al-Qaeda.&lt;ref name="zarate"/&gt; However, a senior U.S. administration official said that although al-Zawahiri was likely to be al-Qaeda's next leader, his authority was not "universally accepted" among al-Qaeda's followers, particularly in the Gulf region.

====Imprisonment====

=====Egypt=====
Al-Zawahiri was convicted of dealing in weapons and received a three-year sentence, which he completed in 1984, shortly after his conviction.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, pp. 57–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Russia=====
At some point in 1994, al-Zawahiri was said to have "become [[Wikt:phantom#Noun|a phantom]]"&lt;ref name=wrightp250&gt;Wright, p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt; but is thought to have traveled widely to "Switzerland and [[Sarajevo]]". A fake passport he was using shows that he traveled to [[Malaysia]], [[Taiwan]], [[Singapore]], and [[Hong Kong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.unhas.ac.id/rhiza/arsip/TheLoomingTower.pdf |publisher=[[Hasanuddin University]] |page=279 |first=Lawrence |last=Wright |title=The Looming Tower: Al-Qaeda and the Road to 9/11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 1, 1996, [[Ahmad Salama Mabruk]] and [[Mahmud Hisham al-Hennawi]] – both carrying false passports – accompanied al-Zawahiri on a trip to [[Chechnya]], where they hoped to re-establish the faltering Jihad. Their leader was traveling under the [[Pseudonym#Military and paramilitary organizations|pseudonym]] ''[[Abdullah (name)|Abdullah]] [[Imam]] Mohammed Amin'', and trading on his medical credentials for legitimacy. The group switched vehicles three times, but were arrested within hours of entering Russian territory and spent five months in a [[Makhachkala]] prison awaiting trial. The trio pleaded innocence, maintaining their disguise and having other al-Jihad members from ''Bavari-C'' send the Russian authorities pleas for leniency for their "merchant" colleagues who had been wrongly arrested; and Russian Member of Parliament [[Nadyr Khachiliev]] echoed the pleas for their speedy release as al-Jihad members [[Ibrahim Eidarous]] and [[Tharwat Salah Shehata]] traveled to [[Dagestan]] to plead for their release. Shehata received permission to visit the prisoners, and is believed to have smuggled them $3000 which was later confiscated from their cell, and to have given them a letter which the Russians didn't bother to translate.&lt;ref name="instead"/&gt; In April 1997, the trio were sentenced to six months, and were subsequently released a month later and ran off without paying their court-appointed attorney Abulkhalik Abdusalamov his $1,800 legal fee citing their "poverty".&lt;ref name="instead"&gt;[[Wall Street Journal]], "Saga of Dr. Zawahri Sheds Light On the Roots of al Qaeda Terror".&lt;/ref&gt; Shehata was sent on to Chechnya, where he met with [[Ibn Khattab]].&lt;ref name=wrightp250/&gt;&lt;ref name="instead"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Khalil |last=Gebara |title=The End of Egyptian Islamic Jihad? |publisher=The Jamestown Foundation |date=February 10, 2005 |url=http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=411&amp;issue_id=3228&amp;article_id=2369243 |accessdate=December 7, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061121012526/http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=411&amp;issue_id=3228&amp;article_id=2369243 |archivedate=November 21, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first = Philippe| last = Naughton| title = The man they call Osama bin Laden's brain|work=The Times |location=UK | date = August 4, 2005| url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article551544.ece| accessdate =May 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leaving Egypt===
During this time, al-Zawahiri also began reconstituting the Egyptian Islamic Jihad (EIJ) along with other exiled militants.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lawrence Wright]], [[The Looming Tower]], 2006 {{ISBN|0-375-41486-X}} .&lt;/ref&gt; The group had "very loose ties to their [[Wikt:nominal#Adjective|nominal]] imprisoned leader, Abud al-Zumur."{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

In Peshwar, al-Zawahiri is thought to have become [[radicalized]] by other Al-Jihad members, abandoning his old strategy of a swift coup d'état to change society from above, and embracing the idea of [[takfir]].&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Usama Rushdi. Wright, 2006, pp. 124–5.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, EIJ broke with al-Zumur, and al-Zawahiri grabbed "the reins of power" to become EIJ leader.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Activities in the Islamic Republic of Iran===
Zawahiri has allegedly worked with the Islamic Republic of Iran on behalf of al-Qaeda. Lawrence Wright reports that EIJ operative Ali Mohammed "told the FBI that al-Jihad had planned a coup in Egypt in 1990." Zawahiri had studied the 1979 Islamist [[Islamic Revolution]] and "sought training from the Iranians" as to how to duplicate their feat against the Egyptian government.

&lt;blockquote&gt;He offered Iran information about an Egyptian government plan to storm several islands in the Persian Gulf that both Iran and the United Arab Emirates lay claim to. According to Mohammed, in return for this information, the Iranian government paid Zawahiri $2&amp;nbsp;million and helped train members of al-Jihad in a coup attempt that never actually took place.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, in public Zawahiri has harshly denounced the Iranian government. In December 2007 he said, "We discovered Iran collaborating with America in its invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq."&lt;ref name=lauramansfield&gt;[http://www.lauramansfield.com/subscribers/20071216_zawahiri.asp Ayman al Zawahiri: Review of Events: As Sahab's Fourth Interview with Zawahiri] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080101000305/http://www.lauramansfield.com/subscribers/20071216_zawahiri.asp |date=January 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same video messages, he moreover chides Iran for "repeating the ridiculous joke that says that al-Qaida and the Taliban are agents of America," before playing a video clip in which [[Ayatollah Rafsanjani]] says, "In Afghanistan, they were present in Afghanistan, because of Al-Qa'ida; and the Taliban, who created the Taliban? America is the one who created the Taliban, and America's friends in the region are the ones who financed and armed the Taliban."&lt;ref name=lauramansfield/&gt;

Zawahiri's criticism of Iran's government continues when he states,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Despite Iran's repetition of the slogan 'Death to America, death to Israel,' we haven't heard even one Fatwa from one Shiite authority, whether in Iran or elsewhere, calling for Jihad against the Americans in Iraq and Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=lauramansfield/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Zawahiri has dismissed that there is any cooperation between Iran and Al Qaeda against their common enemy, ''[[viz.|viz]]'', the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=9a5_1198012243|title=Al-Zawahiri: 'Iran Stabbed a Knife into the Back of the Islamic Nation}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also said that "Iran [[Wikt:stab in the back|Stabbed a Knife into the Back]] of the Islamic Nation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://memri.org/bin/articles.cgi?Page=archives&amp;Area=sd&amp;ID=SP178707|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109013846/http://memri.org/bin/articles.cgi?Page=archives&amp;Area=sd&amp;ID=SP178707|dead-url=yes|archive-date=9 January 2008|title=Al-Zawahiri in Two Recent Messages: ‘Iran Stabbed a Knife into the Back of the Islamic Nation;’ Urges Hamas to Declare Commitment to Restoring the Caliphate|publisher=MEMRI|date=18 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2008, Zawahiri blamed Iranian state media and [[Al-Manar]] for perpetuating the "lie" that "there are no heroes among the Sunnis who can hurt America as no-one else did in history" in order [[Discrediting tactic|to discredit]] the Al Qaeda network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7361414.stm|title=Al-Qaeda accuses Iran of 9/11 lie|date=22 April 2008 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zawahiri was referring to some [[9/11 conspiracy theories]] according to which Al Qaeda was not responsible for the 9/11 attacks.

On the seventh anniversary of the attacks of September 11, 2001, Zawahiri released a 90-minute tape&lt;ref name="msnbc.msn.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26611113/ |title=Al-Qaida tape blasts Iran for working with U.S.|publisher=MSNBC|accessdate=3 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he [[Wikt:blasted#Adverb|blasted]] "the guardian of Muslims in Tehran" for recognizing "the two [[Wikt:hireling|hireling]] governments"&lt;ref name="iht.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/09/08/africa/ME-Al-Qaida-Tape.php |title=Search – Global Edition – The New York Times |work=International Herald Tribune |date=29 March 2009 |accessdate=3 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207045947/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/09/08/africa/ME-Al-Qaida-Tape.php |archivedate=December 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Iraq and Afghanistan.

===Alleged activities in Russia===
There have been doubts as to the true nature of al-Zawahiri's encounter with the Russians in 1996. Washington, D.C.-based [[Jamestown Foundation]] scholar [[Evgenii Novikov]] has argued that it seems unlikely that the Russians would not have been able to determine who he was, given their well-trained Arabists and the obviously suspicious act of Muslims crossing illegally a border with multiple false identities and encrypted documents in Arabic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Evgenii |last=Novikov |title=A Russian agent at the right hand of bin Laden? |publisher=The Jamestown Foundation |date=January 15, 2004 |url=http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=400&amp;issue_id=2899&amp;article_id=23472 |accessdate=April 16, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080619002933/http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=400&amp;issue_id=2899&amp;article_id=23472 |archivedate=June 19, 2008 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first = Peter| last = Finn| title = Fear Rules In Russia's Courtrooms|work=Washington Post| date = February 27, 2005 | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A56441-2005Feb26| accessdate =May 3, 2008 }}{{Dead link|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assassinated former [[Federal Security Service|FSB]] [[Secret service|secret service officer]] [[Alexander Litvinenko]] alleged, among other things, that during this time, al-Zawahiri was indeed being trained by the FSB,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Obituary: Alexander Litvinenko |publisher=BBC News | date = November 24, 2006| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6163502.stm| accessdate =April 16, 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080307180315/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6163502.stm| archivedate= March 7, 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that he was not the only link between al-Qaeda and the FSB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Sean |last=Osborne |title=Ayman al-Zawahiri: Echoes of Alexander Litvinenko |publisher=Northeast Intelligence Network |date=May 6, 2007 |url=http://www.homelandsecurityus.com/node/993 |accessdate=April 16, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207090512/http://www.homelandsecurityus.com/node/993 |archivedate=December 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[KGB]] officer, speaker on the [[Voice of America]] and writer [[Konstantin Preobrazhenskiy]] supported Litvinenko's claim and said that Litvinenko "was responsible for securing the secrecy of Al-Zawahiri's arrival in Russia, who was trained by FSB instructors in [[Dagestan]], [[Northern Caucasus]], during 1996–1997."&lt;ref&gt;[http://cicentre.com/Documents/russia_islam_not_separate.html Russia and Islam are not Separate: Why Russia backs Al-Qaeda], by Konstantin Preobrazhensky. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219040336/http://cicentre.com/Documents/russia_islam_not_separate.html |date=December 19, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Activities in Egypt===
{{Main|November 1997 Luxor massacre}}
While there Zawahiri learned of a "[[Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya#Nonviolence Initiative|Nonviolence Initiative]]" being organized in Egypt to end the [[Military campaign|terror campaign]] that had killed hundreds and resulting government crackdown that had imprisoned thousands. Zawahiri angrily opposed this "surrender" in letters to the London newspaper ''[[Al-Sharq al-Awsat]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, pp. 255–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Together with members of [[al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya]], he helped organize a massive attack on tourists at the [[Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut#See also|Temple of Hatshepsut]] to [[sabotage]] [[Initiative|the initiative]] by provoking the government into [[Political repression|repression]].&lt;ref&gt;Wright, pp. 256–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The attack by six men dressed in police uniforms succeeded in machine-gunning and hacking to death 58 foreign tourists and four [[Egyptian people|Egyptians]], including "a five-year-old British child and four Japanese couples on their honeymoons," and devastated the Egyptian tourist industry for a number of years. Nonetheless the Egyptian reaction was not what Zawahiri had hoped for. The attack so stunned and angered Egyptian society that Islamists denied responsibility. Zawahiri blamed the police for the killing, but also held the tourists responsible for their own deaths for coming to Egypt,
&lt;blockquote&gt;The people of Egypt consider the presence of these foreign tourists to be aggression against Muslims and Egypt... The young men are saying that this is our country and not a place for frolicking and enjoyment, especially for you.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, pp. 257–8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The massacre was so unpopular that no terror attacks occurred in Egypt for several years thereafter.{{Clarify|date=May 2011|reason=more precision needed; if opinion, needs attribution; replace several by a number}} Zawahiri was [[death penalty|sentenced to death]] ''[[trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' in 1999 by an Egyptian [[military tribunal]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/English/archive/archive?ArchiveId=2567 Al Jazeera English – Archive – Profile: Ayman Al-Zawahiri&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221085539/http://english.aljazeera.net/English/archive/archive?ArchiveId=2567 |date=December 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri (2001) in ''Knights Under the Prophet's Banner'' which was released by [[Al-Sharq Al-Awsat]].

[[File:Hamid Mir interviewing Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri 2001.jpg|thumb|left|[[Osama bin Laden]] sits with his adviser al-Zawahiri during an interview with Pakistani journalist [[Hamid Mir]], in November 2001.]]

Following the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|U.S. invasion of Afghanistan]], al-Zawahiri's whereabouts are unknown, but he is generally thought to be in tribal Pakistan. Although he releases videos of himself frequently ''(see [[Messages of Ayman al-Zawahiri]])'', al-Zawahiri did not appear alongside bin Laden in any of them after 2003. In 2003, it was rumored that he was under arrest in Iran, although this was later discovered to be false.&lt;ref&gt;[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]], [http://www.aljazeerah.info/News%20archives/2003%20News%20archives/June%202003%20News/28n/Iran%20Holding%20Zawahiri%20Abu%20Ghaith%20AlArabiya%20TV.htm Iran holding Zawahiri, Abu Ghaith; al-Arabiya TV], June 28, 2003. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041013115813/http://www.aljazeerah.info/News%20archives/2003%20News%20archives/June%202003%20News/28n/Iran%20Holding%20Zawahiri%20Abu%20Ghaith%20AlArabiya%20TV.htm |date=October 13, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the Pakistan Army launched an aggressive [[Battle of wana|operation]] in Wana, Pakistan. Reports began to surface that he was trapped in the center of the conflict by the army. But when, after weeks of fighting, the army captured the area, it was later revealed that he either escaped or was never among the fighters. As the conflict spread into the tribal areas of western Pakistan, Ayman al-Zawahiri became a prime target of the [[ISI (Pakistan)|ISI]]'s Directorate for Joint Counterintelligence Bureau (J-COIN Bureau). However, despite a series of operations they were unable to capture him.

On January 13, 2006, the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], aided by Pakistan's ISI, launched an [[Damadola airstrike|airstrike on Damadola]], a Pakistani village near the Afghan border where they believed al-Zawahiri was located. The airstrike was supposed to kill al-Zawahiri and this was reported in international news over the following days. Many victims of the airstrike were buried without being identified. Anonymous U.S. government officials claimed that some terrorists were killed and the Bajaur tribal area government confirmed that at least four terrorists were among the dead.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2006-01-17-pakistan-strike_x.htm?csp=24 Pakistan: At least 4 terrorists killed in U.S. strike – USA Today].&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-American protests broke out around the country and the [[Pakistani government]] condemned the U.S. attack and the loss of [[innocent]] life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4614486.stm|title=BBC NEWS – South Asia – Pakistan rally against US strike|publisher=|accessdate=April 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 30, a new video was released showing al-Zawahiri unhurt. The video discussed the airstrike, but did not reveal if al-Zawahiri was present in the village at that time.

On August 1, 2008, [[CBS News]] reported that it had obtained a copy of an intercepted letter dated July 29, 2008, from unnamed sources in Pakistan, which urgently requested a doctor to treat al-Zawahiri. The letter indicated that al-Zawahiri was critically injured in a US missile strike at Azam Warsak village in South Waziristan on July 28 that also reportedly killed al Qaeda explosives expert [[Abu Khabab al-Masri]]. Taliban Mehsud spokesman [[Maulvi Umar]] told the [[Associated Press]] on August 2, 2008, that the report of al-Zawahiri's injury was false.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Associated Press]]'', "[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008/aug/03/missile-strike-on-al-zawahri-disputed/ Missile Strike On Al-Zawahri Disputed]", August 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early September 2008, Pakistan Army claimed that they "almost" captured al-Zawahiri after getting information that he and his wife were in the [[Mohmand Agency]], in northwest Pakistan. After raiding the area, officials didn't find him.&lt;ref name="USCTnotdead"&gt;{{cite news|title=No evidence of al Qaeda No. 2's illness or death, U.S. says|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/meast/08/01/alzawahiri/|publisher=CNN|date=August 1, 2008|accessdate=August 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013, al-Zawahiri [[Arbitration|arbitrated]] against the merger of the [[Islamic State of Iraq]] with the Syrian-based [[Jabhat al-Nusra]] into [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] as was declared in April by [[Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2013/06/201368194537304613.html|title=Qaeda chief arbitrates Syria’s 'jihad crisis'|first=Basma|last=Atassi|publisher=|accessdate=April 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abu Mohammad al-Julani]], leader of al-Nusra Front, affirmed the group's allegiance to al-Qaeda and al-Zawahiri.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/10067318/Syria-Jabhat-al-Nusra-split-after-leaders-pledge-of-support-for-al-Qaeda.html|title=Syria: Jabhat al-Nusra split after leader's pledge of support for al-Qaeda|work=The Telegraph|date=19 May 2013|accessdate=21 May 2013|location=London|first=Richard|last=Spencer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2013/06/2013615172217827810.html|title=Iraqi al-Qaeda chief rejects Zawahiri orders|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=15 June 2013|accessdate=15 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Loyalty and enmity ===
In a lengthy treatise titled "Loyalty and Enmity", Zawahiri argues that Muslims must at all times be loyal to Islam and to one another, while hating or at least [[Muslim hygienical jurisprudence#Islamic cleanliness and hygiene|being clean]] from everything and everyone outside of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ibrahim|first=Raymond|title=The Al Qaeda Reader|year=2007|publisher=Broadway Books|isbn=978-0-7679-2262-3|page=63|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tdx3M-bHj34C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Female combatants===

Zawahiri has said in an interview that the group does not have women combatants and that a woman's role is limited to caring for the homes and children of al-Qaeda fighters. This resulted in a debate regarding the role of [[mujahid]] women like [[Sajida Mubarak Atrous al-Rishawi]].&lt;ref&gt;Frayer, Lauren.{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=4970220 |title="Al-Qaida's Stance on Women Sparks Extremist Debate." |accessdate=2008-05-31 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207045227/http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=4970220 |archivedate=December 7, 2008 |df=mdy }}  ''[[Associated Press]]'' at ''[[ABC News]]''.

Zawahiri places supreme importance on winning public support, and [[castigated]] [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]] in this regard: "In the absence of this popular support the Islamic mujahid movement would be crushed in the shadows."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jones |first=Seth G. |year=2012 |title=Think Again: Al Qaeda |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/04/23/think_again_al_qaeda?page=0,5 |journal=Foreign Policy |issue=May/June 2012 |accessdate=28 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428181815/http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/04/23/think_again_al_qaeda?page=0%2C5 |archivedate=April 28, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Babbar''' is a Sikh Jatt surname known as strong protecting warriors thus leading to the use of Babbar in the [[‘Babbar Akali movement’]], and Babbar Khalsa. The term ‘Babbar Sher’ also refers to a dominating male in a lion clan.

The '''Babbar Akali movement''' was a 1921 splinter group of "militant" Sikhs who broke away from the mainstream [[Akali movement]] over the latter's insistence on non-violence over [[gurdwara]] reforms.

Babbar is also a [[Mair Rajput]] surname originating in the Ajmer-Merwara region in Rajasthan of the [[Indian subcontinent]].This name is also the name of a [[Jat people|Jatt]] clan) They are traditionally members of the military or ran in an administrative capacity. Over the course of time, Babbars migrated to places across [[Punjab region|Punjab]] from  [[Ajmer-Merwara]] and [[Rajputana]].

Babbars came to be known as Mair Rajputs from within amongst the Saraiki Hindu Rajputs and originate from the Rajput clans of [[Rajasthan]] in [[Ajmer]] and migrated to the Punjab later in their history. 

Today, Babbars live in numerous regions within India and Pakistan, but are mostly concentrated in [[Haryana]], [[Delhi]], [[Uttar Pradesh]].&lt;ref name="Imperialrule"&gt;Imperial Rule in the Punjab: The Conquest and Administration of Multan, 1818-1881 by J[ames] Royal Roseberry, III.

The '''Ba-ka-Nswazwi''' people are originally [[Bapedi]] of Mujaji (Rain Queen). They are found in [[Tutume]], [[Nswazwi]], Marapong, [[Masunga]] and Nkange in [[Botswana]].

==History==
The Baka-Nswazwi have been [[Cultural assimilation|assimilated]] over the years into [[BaKalanga|Kalanga]] ([[Bakalanga]]) culture and lost their language. 

They were led by [[John Madawo Nswazwi]], who was born in [[Nswazwi]] in then [[Bechuanaland]] in 1875. [[John Nswazwi]] was exiled to Mafikeng in 1947 by the colonial government as a result of a conflict with the [[Bangwato]] regent [[Tshekedi Khama]]. Tshekedi Khama was the uncle of [[Seretse Khama]], the first president of [[Botswana]].

The '''bone rank system''' was the system of [[Aristocracy|aristocratic]] rank used in the ancient [[Korea]]n kingdom of [[Silla]]. It was used to segregate society, and particularly the layers of the aristocracy, on the basis of their [[hereditary]] proximity to the throne and the level of authority they were permitted to wield. The idea of [[Royal descent|royal blood]] in other societies is a close analogue to the idea of "sacred bone" in Silla thought.

Bone rank was strictly hereditary, and thus acted as a [[caste system]]. The scholar, Lee Ki-Baik (1984, p.&amp;nbsp;43) considers it to have probably been adopted as part of the administrative law introduced from [[China]] and promulgated by [[Beopheung of Silla|King Beopheung]] in 520. However, this likely did nothing but institute in legal fact what was already a society segregated by bloodline and [[lineage (anthropology)|lineage]]. Although only two of the five known ranks were referred to as "bone" (골, 骨), the term "bone rank" has become widely used to describe the whole system.
[[File:Relationship of Bone-Rank Gradations in the kingdom of Silla, to Office Rank and Post.jpg|thumb|Relationship of Bone-Rank Gradations in Silla to Office Rank and Post &lt;ref&gt;Adapted from: Lee, Ki-baik. ''A New History of Korea'' (Translated by Edward W. Wagner with Edward J. Shultz), (Cambridge, MA:Harvard University Press, 1984), p. 51. {{ISBN|0-674-61576-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A person's bone rank status governed not only official status and marriage rights, but also the color of one's garments and the maximum dimensions of one's dwelling and carriage. These criteria are described in detail in the 12th century Korean history ''[[Samguk Sagi]]'', particularly its [[Monograph]]s (''ji'' 志), book 2 (ranks and offices). The ''Samguk Sagi'''s depiction of Silla life, however, has often been criticized for being excessively static. Unfortunately, since other sources are scarce, it is difficult to judge what sort of changes may have taken place in the bone rank system over the centuries.
== Rank ==
*'''&lt;big&gt;Sacred Bone (Seonggol)&lt;/big&gt;'''
The highest level of the bone rank was the "'''sacred bone'''", or '''''seonggol''''' (성골, 聖骨), sometimes termed "hallowed bone", which consisted only of a portion of the [[Kim (Korean name)#Gyeongju|royal Kim family]], possibly those considered to have royal blood on both sides.&lt;ref name="Kim"&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Korea: From "Land of the Morning Calm" to States in Conflict |last=Kim |first=Jinwung |date=2012 |publisher=University of Indiana Press |pages=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until this rank was abolished with the ascension of [[Muyeol of Silla|King Muyeol]] in 654, only those holding sacred bone rank were permitted to assume the throne. This led to the crowning of [[Queen Seondeok of Silla|Queen Seondeok]] in 632 and [[Queen Jindeok of Silla|Queen Jindeok]] in 647, because no males of the sacred bone rank were available.&lt;ref name="Kim" /&gt; This situation may have led to its subsequent abolition.

*'''&lt;big&gt;True Bone (Jingol)&lt;/big&gt;'''
Below the sacred bone came the "'''true bone'''", or '''''jingol''''' (진골, 眞骨), which included the rest of the royal family, as well as the Bak and Seok families of [[Gyeongju]], which had held the throne in very early times and were involved in most royal marriages, as well as another Kim ['Kimhae' royal clan] lineage descended from the royal house of [[Geumgwan Gaya]]. Members of the true bone could hold any official position, up to the level of full minister. They could also attain office rank up to the highest, ''ibolchan'' (이벌찬). After the sacred bone rank was abolished under King Muyol, only those holding the true bone rank could become king.

*'''&lt;big&gt;Head Ranks&lt;/big&gt;'''
Below the "true bone" came the head ranks (두품, 頭品), of which only the 6th, 5th and 4th are attested, 6th being the highest. The origins of these lower head rank classes and what defined one‘s status as such are obscure and still debated among scholars. As the ''jingol'' were prohibited from marrying into the lower ranks, though they could take concubines from them, it is feasible that one source of the head rank six were the children born from unions between ''jingol'' fathers and lower ranking concubines. In any case, members of the head rank six could rise to the position of vice-minister (''gyeong'', 경, 卿) and as high as the 6th level of office rank, '''''achan''''' (아찬, 阿餐) (two higher ranks of ''jungachan'' (중아찬, 重阿餐) and ''sajung achan'' (사중아찬, 四重阿餐) were later supplemented to that of ''achan'' but these still fell within the 6th level). Members of head ranks four and five could rise only to minor posts. Members of head rank five could reach the 10th level of office rank, ''daenaema'' (대내마, 大奈麻), while members of head rank four could attain only the 12th level of office rank, ''daesa'' (대사, 大舍). There were 17 levels of office rank altogether.  One scholar has proposed that, "head-ranks three, two, and one, if they ever formally existed, must have designated the ... non-privileged general populace."&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Ki-baik. ''A New History of Korea'' (Translated by Edward W. Wagner with Edward J. Shultz), (Cambridge, MA:Harvard University Press, 1984), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evaluations ==
The frustrated ambitions of the head rank six class in particular seem to have played a prominent role in the politics of the late Silla period. Many men of head rank six status, proscribed from rising too high in the Silla administrative system defined by the bone rank system, sought to bypass this by studying [[Confucianism]] (either in Silla or abroad in [[Tang China]]) or else turned to careers in [[Buddhism]]. The most prominent of the head rank six figures was undoubtedly [[Choe Chiwon]], who following an illustrious career in China returned to Silla only to see his attempts at administrative reform rebuffed by an entrenched aristocracy. In the early 10th century the nascent state of [[Goryeo]], which succeeded Silla, tapped into the head rank six intellectuals to man its bureaucracy.

The bone rank system's extreme rigidity certainly helped to weaken Silla toward the end of the [[Unified Silla]] period, although numerous other factors were at play. After the fall of Silla, the bone rank system was abolished entirely, although different and somewhat more flexible caste systems persisted until near the end of the [[Joseon Dynasty]] in the late 19th century.

'''Chipilo Venetian''', or '''Chipileño''', is a [[diaspora language]] currently spoken by the descendants of some five hundred 19th century [[Veneto|Venetian]] immigrants to [[Mexico]]. The [[Venice|Venetians]] settled in the State of [[Puebla]], founding the city of [[Chipilo]]. This Venetian variety is also spoken in other communities in [[Veracruz]] and [[Querétaro]], places where the ''chipileños'' settled as well.

Although the city of [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]] has grown so far as to almost absorb it, the town of Chipilo remained isolated for much of the 20th century. Thus, the Cipiłàn/''chipileños'', unlike other European immigrants that came to Mexico, did not blend into the Mexican culture and retained most of their traditions and their language. To this day, many of the people in Chipilo speak the ''Venetan'' or [[Venetian language]] of their great-grandparents. The variant of the Venetan language spoken by the Cipiłàn/''chipileños'' is the northern Traixàn-Fheltrìn-Bełumàt. Surprisingly, it has been barely altered by [[Spanish language|Spanish]], as compared to how the dialect of the northern Veneto has been altered by [[Italian language|Italian]]. Given the number of speakers of Venetan, and even though the state government has not done so, the Venetan language has to be considered a minority language in the State of Puebla.

There have been several attempts to establish a writing system for the Venetian form spoken in Chipilo. One such system was created by Carolyn McKay, an American linguist who conducted postgraduate research at the [[Universidad de las Américas (Mexico)|Universidad de las Américas]]. Her proposed system, entirely based on the [[Italian alphabet]], was published in a book entitled ''Il dialetto veneto di Segusino e Chipilo''. This system has been used in some publications made by Cipiłàn/''chipileños'', but it has not received wide acceptance, because of the striking differences between Venetan and Italian phonemes. Most of the speakers use the [[Spanish orthography|Spanish system]] they learn at school, even though it does not have letters for specific sounds such as the voiced-S (written {{angbr|x}} in modern Venetan), or the {{IPAblink|θ}} (written {{angbr|th}} in modern Venetan), and {{IPAblink|ð}} (written {{angbr|dh}} in modern Venetan). Nevertheless, Eduardo Montagner, an [[Italo-Mexican]] from Chipilo, has suggested the standardization of a writing system based on the Spanish alphabet.

'''Crime in Sweden''' describes an act defined in the Swedish Penal Code ({{lang-sv|Brottsbalken}}) or in another [[Law of Sweden|Swedish law]] or statutory instrument for which a sanction is prescribed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Swedish Penal Code|url=http://www.government.se/content/1/c6/02/77/77/cb79a8a3.pdf|publisher=[[Government of Sweden]]|accessdate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Law 1994:458|url=http://lagen.nu/1962:700#K1P1S1|website=Lagen.nu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal proceedings==
{{See also|Judicial system of Sweden#Courts|Law enforcement in Sweden}}

When a crime has been committed the authorities will investigate what has happened, this is known as the preliminary investigation and it will be led by a police officer or prosecutor.&lt;ref name=trials&gt;{{cite web|title=Trials in criminal cases|url=http://www.hogstadomstolen.se/Funktioner/English/Legal-proceedings/Trials-in-criminal-cases/|publisher=[[Supreme Court of Sweden]]|accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Swedish police and the prosecution service are required to register and prosecute all offences of which they become aware.&lt;ref name="VonHofer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="diskussionsunderlag" /&gt;&lt;ref name=duty-prosecute&gt;{{cite web|title=Duty to prosecute|url=http://www.aklagare.se/In-English/The-role-of-the-prosecutor/Decision-to-prosecute/Duty-to-prosecute/|publisher=The Swedish Prosecution Authority|accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecutors are lawyers employed by the [[Swedish Prosecution Authority]], a wholly independent organisation not dependent on courts or the police, and not directed by the [[Ministry of Justice (Sweden)|Ministry of Justice]] (any [[Ministerstyre|ministerial interference]] is in fact unconstitutional).&lt;ref name=about-prosecution&gt;{{cite web|title=The Swedish Prosecution Authority|url=http://www.aklagare.se/In-English/|publisher=The Swedish Prosecution Authority|accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prosecutor are obliged to lead and direct the preliminary investigations of a crime impartially and objective, make decisions on prosecution issues, and appear in court to process actions in criminal cases. Suspects are entitled to a public defence counsel, either during the preliminary investigation stage or during the trial. The suspect is entitled to examine the material gathered by the prosecutor, and is allowed to request the police to conduct further investigation, if he or she considers this to be necessary. A preliminary investigation supervisor decides whether or not these measures can be carried out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Suspect|url=http://www.aklagare.se/In-English/Are-you/Suspect/|publisher=The Swedish Prosecution Authority|accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of less serious crimes, if the suspect admits that he/she has committed the offence and it is clear what the punishment should be, the prosecutor can pronounce a so-called order of summary punishment.&lt;ref name="trials" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Summary punishment|url=http://www.aklagare.se/In-English/The-role-of-the-prosecutor/Decision-to-prosecute/Summary-punishment/|publisher=The Swedish Prosecution Authority|accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A preliminary investigation not discontinued may result in the prosecutor deciding to prosecute a person for the crime. This means that there will be a trial at the [[District courts of Sweden|District Court]].&lt;ref name="trials" /&gt; The person who has been convicted, the prosecutor and the victim of the crime can appeal against the District Court judgement in the [[Courts of appeal in Sweden|Court of Appeal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Appealing a criminal case|url=http://www.hogstadomstolen.se/Funktioner/English/Legal-proceedings/Trials-in-criminal-cases/Appeal/|publisher=[[Supreme Court of Sweden]]|accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Confidence in the criminal justice system===
Six out of ten respondents surveyed in the SCS 2013 said they had a high level of confidence in the criminal justice system as a whole, and the police enjoyed similarly high confidence levels. Of the crime victims, a little over half of all surveyed (57%) stated that their experience of the police was generally positive, and nearly one in seven stated that the experience was negative.&lt;ref name="SCS2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bra.se/download/18.9eaaede145606cc86546f/1398774378897/2014_Swedish_Crime_Survey_2013.pdf|title=The Swedish Crime Survey 2013|publisher=[[Brå]]|accessdate=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corruption==
{{Main|Corruption in Sweden}}
In general, the level of [[Political corruption|corruption]] in [[Sweden]] is very low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Motståndskraft, oberoende, integritet – kan det svenska samhället stå emot korruption?|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/media/3831417/TI-Sverige_ENIS_studie-2.pdf|work=Transparency International Sweden|publisher=Transparency International Sweden|accessdate=17 November 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203052802/http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/media/3831417/TI-Sverige_ENIS_studie-2.pdf|archivedate=3 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legal and institutional framework in Sweden are considered effective in fighting against corruption, and the government agencies are characterized by a high degree of transparency, integrity and accountability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Snapshot of the Sweden Country Profile|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/europe-central-asia/sweden/snapshot.aspx|work=Business Anti-Corruption Portal|publisher=GAN Integrity Solutions|accessdate=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crime statistics==
{{Details|Crime in Sweden#Crime trends}}

Sweden began recording national crime statistics in 1950, and the method for recording crime has basically remained unchanged until the mid-1960s, when the [[Swedish police]] introduced new procedures for crime statistics, which have been presented as a partial explanation for the historical increase in crime reports.&lt;ref name="crime-trend-stats-1" /&gt; In 1974, the [[Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention]] ({{lang-sv|Brottsförebyggande rådet}}, abbreviated Brå) became the [[government agency]] tasked with producing [[official statistics]] and disseminating knowledge on crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Brå|url=http://www.bra.se/bra/bra-in-english/home/about-bra.html|publisher=The Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention|accessdate=14 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1990s a new crime reporting system was implemented, which meant that the manual controls became less frequent, resulting in an additional increase in the number of reported crimes.&lt;ref name=crime-trend-stats-2&gt;{{cite web|title=Rapport 2008:23 - Brottsutvecklingen i sverige fram till år 2007|url=http://www.bra.se/download/18.cba82f7130f475a2f180006972/2008_23_brottsuvecklingen.pdf|publisher=[[Brå]]|accessdate=16 July 2014|page=61|language=Swedish|quote=Den stora ökningen av antalet anmälda brott sedan början 1990-talet förklaras i huvudsak av det anmälningssystem som polisen då införde}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, the [[Löfven Cabinet]] denied the request from member parliament [[Staffan Danielsson]] to update the [[Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention|BRÅ]] statistics on crime with respect to national or immigration background of the perpetrator, as had previously been done in 1995,  2005 but the 2015 was overdue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.svt.se/nyheter/inrikes/krav-ny-undersokning-av-utrikesfodda-och-brott|title=Krav på att Brå tar fram statistik över brott och ursprung|last=Nyheter|first=SVT|work=svt.se|access-date=23 May 2017|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International comparison===
Comparisons between countries based on official crime statistics (i.e. "crime reports") require caution, since such statistics are produced differently in different countries. Legal and substantive factors also influence the number of reported crimes.&lt;ref name=VonHofer&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Von Hofer|first1=Hanns|title=Crime Statistics as Constructs: The Case of Swedish Rape Statistics|journal=European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research|date=2000|volume=8|issue=1|pages=77–89|doi=10.1023/A:1008713631586}}&lt;!--|accessdate=11 July 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=diskussionsunderlag&gt;{{cite web|title=Våldsbrottsligheten: Ökande, minskande eller konstant?

* Sweden applies a system of expansive offence counts for [[violent crime]]s, meaning the same crime may be recorded several times, such as in the case of a [[gang rape]]. Other countries may employ more restrictive methods of counting.&lt;ref name="VonHofer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="diskussionsunderlag" /&gt;
* In Sweden, crime data is collected when the offence in question is first reported, at which point the classification of the offence may be unclear.&lt;ref name="VonHofer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="diskussionsunderlag" /&gt; It retains this classification in the published crime statistics, even if later investigations indicate that no crime has been committed.&lt;ref name="VonHofer" /&gt;
* The Swedish police and the [[Law enforcement in Sweden#Swedish Prosecution Authority|prosecution service]] are required to register and prosecute all offences of which they become aware. This can be assumed to lead to a more frequent registration of offences than in systems where the classification of offences is negotiable on the basis of [[plea bargaining]].&lt;ref name="VonHofer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="diskussionsunderlag" /&gt;
* Willingness to report crime also affects the statistics.&lt;ref name="explained-official" /&gt; A police force and judicial system enjoining a high level of confidence and a good reputation with the public will produce a higher propensity to report crime than a police force which is discredited, inspires fear or distrust.&lt;ref name="VonHofer" /&gt;

Large-scale [[victim study|victimisation surveys]] have been presented as a more reliable indicator on the level of crime in a given country.&lt;ref name="VonHofer" /&gt;

==Crime trends==
By 2018 gang violence, which had long been a feature of [[vulnerable area]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, had begun to spill out into the wider society where hopsital staff reported armed confrontations in emergency rooms and school authorities reported that threats and weapons having become commonplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/03/world/europe/sweden-crime-immigration-hand-grenades.html|title=Hand Grenades and Gang Violence Rattle Sweden’s Middle Class|last=Anderson|first=Ellen Barry and Christina|access-date=2018-08-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Swedish Crime Survey (SCS) (sv:''Nationella trygghetsundersökningen) is a recurrent victim survey since 2005 by [[Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention|Brå]] of the attitudes and experiences of the general population regarding victimization, fear of crime and public confidence in the justice system, with an annual sample size of around 15,000 respondents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Swedish Crime Survey|url=http://www.bra.se/bra/bra-in-english/home/crime-and-statistics/swedish-crime-survey.html|publisher=[[Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention]]|accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Offences against the person===
The level of exposure to offences against the person has decreased somewhat since 2005 (down from 13.1% to 11.4%), according to SCS 2013. Crimes in this group includes assault, threat, sexual offences, mugging, fraud or harassment. In the recently published SCS 2016, exposure to offences has increased to levels as seen prior to 2005, with 13.3% of the people surveyed reporting that they had been victim to one or more of the aforementioned crimes.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=2016|title=Swedish Crime Survey 2016|url=http://bra.se/download/18.4a33c027159a89523b17c401/1487173975453/Summary_NTU_2016.pdf|journal=English summary of Brå report 2017:2|volume=|pages=6|via=BRÅ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around one in four (26%) surveyed report these crimes, which is a decrease by 6 per cent from the previous year (2014).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

====Assault====
While the number of reported assaults has been on the increase, crime victim surveys show that a large part of the increase may be due to the fact that more crimes are actually reported.&lt;ref name=bra-assault&gt;{{cite web|title=Violence and assault|url=http://www.bra.se/bra/bra-in-english/home/crime-and-statistics/violence-and-assault.html|publisher=[[Brå]]|accessdate=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 2013 SCS, the proportion who stated that they have been the victims of assault has declined gradually, from 2.7 per cent in 2005 to 1.9 per cent in 2012. The proportion who are anxious about falling victim to assault has also decreased, from 15 per cent in 2006 to 10 per cent in 2013.&lt;ref name="SCS2013" /&gt; This is supported by medical services reporting unchanged levels of incoming patients with wounds derived from assault or serious violent crime.&lt;ref name="bra-assault" /&gt;&lt;ref name=crime-trend-2007&gt;{{cite web|title=Rapport 2008:23 - Brottsutvecklingen i sverige fram till år 2007|language=Swedish|url=http://www.bra.se/download/18.cba82f7130f475a2f180006972/2008_23_brottsuvecklingen.pdf|publisher=[[Brå]]|accessdate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Estrada|first1=Felipe|title=Våldsutvecklingen i Sverige - En presentation och analys av sjukvårdsdata|date=2005|publisher=Swedish Institute for Futures Studies|location=Stockholm|isbn=91-89655-62-1|url=http://www.iffs.se/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/20051201134809film242m7Rh6IK5vOE2k361.pdf|language=Swedish|quote=Nothing in the hospital data indicates an increase in hospital admissions resulting from serious violent incidents [...] Instead the hospital data serve to verify the more stable trends indicated by victim surveys and lethal violence statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have also shown that police are increasingly likely to personally initiate reports of assault between strangers, which contributes to more cases involving assault being reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rapport 2009:16 - Misshandel mellan obekanta|language=Swedish|url=https://www.bra.se/download/18.cba82f7130f475a2f180001710/1309943407691/2009_16_misshandel_mellan_obekanta.pdf|accessdate=16 July 2014|ref=[[Brå]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the recently published 2016 SCS 2.0 per cent of the population (ages 16–79) were exposed to assault. This level is similar to the previous year, when 2.1 per cent were exposed. Over time, exposure to assault has decreased somewhat, and the percentage of victims has declined by 0.7 percentage points since the survey was first conducted in 2005, reaching its lowest point in 2012 and rising slightly since then. The primary reduction has been among young men.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Exposure to assault is more common for men than women, and most common in the 20–24 age bracket. Assault is most common in a public place and in most cases the perpetrator is unknown to the victim.&lt;ref name="SCS2016" /&gt;

Sweden has a high rate of reported assault crime when compared internationally,&lt;ref name="www-rohan.sdsu.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/faculty/rwinslow/europe/sweden.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=4 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101219004356/http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/faculty/rwinslow/europe/sweden.html |archivedate=19 December 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but this can be explained by legal, procedural and statistical differences.{{ref label|id1|Note 1|1}} For example, the Swedish police applies a system of expansive offence counts for violent crimes, meaning the same crime may be recorded several times.&lt;ref name="diskussionsunderlag" /&gt; The 2005 European Crime and Safety Survey (2005 EU ICS) found that prevalence victimisation rates for assaults with force was below average in Sweden.&lt;ref name="2005-EUICS"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Van Dijk|title=The Burden of Crime in the EU.

==== Threats ====
In 2015, 5.0 per cent were exposed to threats, which is an increase compared with the preceding year (4.1% reported in 2014). The percentage of persons exposed to threats remained at a relatively stable level between 2005 and 2014. The results from coming years will show whether the increase in 2015 is the beginning of a new trend or a temporary deviation from an otherwise relatively stable level.&lt;ref name="SCS2016" /&gt;

Exposure to threats is more common among women than men, and most common in the 20–24 and 25–34 age brackets.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

====Murder and homicide====
{{See also|Murder (Swedish law)}}

The number of cases of lethal violence [Murder, manslaughter, and assault with a lethal outcome) in Sweden remained at a relatively constant level over the period of 2002 to 2016 — on average 92 cases per year.&lt;ref name="bra-murder" /&gt;

Since 2015 there has been an increase in the number of cases of lethal violence and the figure in 2017 was the highest in Sweden since 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/a/7lQKBK/bra-allt-fler-offer-for-dodligt-vald-i-sverige|title=Brå: Allt fler offer för dödligt våld i Sverige|last=Aftonbladet|work=Aftonbladet|access-date=22 June 2018|language=sv-SE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BRADV"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.bra.se/download/18.10aae67f160e3eba62938176/1522248310076/Sammanfattning_D%C3%B6dligtv%C3%A5ld_2017.pdf |title=Konstaterade fall av dödligt våld - En granskning av anmält dödligt våld 2017 |website=Brottsförebyggande rådet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies of lethal violence in Sweden have shown that more than half the reported cases were not actually cases of murder or manslaughter. This is because the Swedish crime statistics show all events with a lethal outcome that the police investigate. Many of these reported crimes turn out to be, in reality, suicides, accidents or natural deaths.&lt;ref name="crime-trend-2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bra-murder" /&gt; 
Despite this statistical anomaly, Sweden has an internationally low murder and homicide rate,{{ref label|id2|Note 2|1}} with approximately 1.14 reported incidents of murder or manslaughter per 100,000 inhabitants as of 2015. The number of "confirmed cases of lethal violence" has fluctuated between 68 and 112 in the period of 2006&amp;ndash;2015, with a decrease from 111 in 2007 to 68 in 2012, followed by an increase to 112 in 2015 and a decrease to 106 in 2016.&lt;ref name=bra-murder&gt;{{cite web|title=Murder and manslaughter|url=http://www.bra.se/bra/bra-in-english/home/crime-and-statistics/murder-and-manslaughter.html|publisher=[[Brå]]|accessdate=26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest increase in 2015 was seen in the Väst region, where the number of cases has increased from 14 cases in 2014 to 34 cases in 2015.&lt;ref name="bra-murder" /&gt;

In 2016 ten out of the 105 murder cases were [[honor killing]]s, representing roughly 10% of all murder cases and a third of all [[Violence against women|murders of women]] in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gp.se/nyheter/sverige/var-tionde-mord-f%C3%B6rra-%C3%A5ret-var-hedersmord-1.4509333|title=Var tionde mord förra året var hedersmord|work=Göteborgs-Posten|access-date=8 August 2017|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017 a survey by [[Dagens Nyheter]] showed that of 100 suspects of murder and attempted murder using firearms, 90 had one parent born abroad 75% were born in the 90s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/vanligt-med-utlandsk-bakgrund-bland-unga-man-som-skjuter/|title=Vanligt med utländsk bakgrund bland unga män som skjuter - DN.SE|date=20 May 2017|work=DN.SE|access-date=20 July 2017|language=sv-se}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a comparison of crime statistics from Norwegian [[Kripos]] and Swedish [[Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention|BRÅ]] done by Norwegian daily newspaper [[Aftenposten]], the murder rate of Sweden has since 2002 been roughly twice that of neighbour country [[Norway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aftenposten.no/verden/i/GVLRV/Svensk-politi-skulle-ta-tilbake-kontrollen-over-utsatte-bydeler-fra-kriminelle-To-ar-senere-er-situasjonen-blitt-enda-verre-|title=Svensk politi skulle ta tilbake kontrollen over lovløse områder.

==== Gun violence ====
Sweden witnessed a steep increase in gun violence in males aged 15 to 29 in the two decades prior to 2018, in addition to a rising trend in gun violence there was also a high rate of gun violence in Sweden compared to other countries in [[Western Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sturup|first=Joakim|last2=Rostami|first2=Amir|last3=Mondani|first3=Hernan|last4=Gerell|first4=Manne|last5=Sarnecki|first5=Jerzy|last6=Edling|first6=Christofer|date=2018-05-07|title=Increased Gun Violence Among Young Males in Sweden: a Descriptive National Survey and International Comparison|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10610-018-9387-0|journal=European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research|language=en|volume=|pages=1–14 / Conclusions|doi=10.1007/s10610-018-9387-0|issn=0928-1371|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a report published by academic researchers in 2017, shooting incidents with fatal outcomes are about 4 to 5 times as common in Sweden compared to neighbouring countries such as [[Germany]] and [[Norway]] when taking population size into account. The city with the highest prevalence of shootings was Malmö. The grave violence in the studied period also changed character, from criminal [[motorcycle gangs]] to city suburbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=103&amp;artikel=6770056|title=Fler skjutningar i Sverige än i många andra länder - P4 Stockholm|last=Radio|first=Sveriges|access-date=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/studie-fler-skjutningar-i-sverige-an-i-manga-andra-lander/|title=Studie: Fler skjutningar i Sverige än i många andra länder - DN.SE|date=5 September 2017|work=DN.SE|access-date=12 September 2017|language=sv-se}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweden also stands out in having a low resolution rate (25%) for gun homicides compared to Germany and Finland at 90%.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In January 2018, police statistics reported an increase in gun homicides from 8 in 2006 to 43 in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.svt.se/nyheter/inrikes/siffrorna-visar-kraftig-okning-av-dodsskjutningar|title=Siffrorna visar: Kraftig ökning av dödsskjutningar|last=Nyheter|first=SVT|work=SVT Nyheter|access-date=22 January 2018|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis of 2011–2017 [[gang warfare]] showed that there were 1500 incidents involving firearms, 131 people had been killed and 520 injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/a/bKzddl/aftonbladets-granskning-avslojar-131-doda--over-520-skottskadade|title=Aftonbladets granskning avslöjar: 131 döda – över 450 skottskadade|work=Aftonbladet|access-date=25 January 2018|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018, criminologist [[Jerzy Sarnecki]] stated in an interview with magazine ''Forskning &amp; Framsteg'' that the increasing levels of gun crime in Sweden had taken him, Swedish [[Criminology|criminologists]] in general and police in Sweden by surprise. He characterised the recent developments as "very serious".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://fof.se/tidning/2018/2/artikel/laget-ar-javligt-allvarligt|title="Läget är jävligt allvarligt"|work=Forskning &amp; Framsteg|access-date=21 February 2018|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2018 systematic review of 25 studies on firearm violence in Sweden concluded "that even though knives/sharp weapons continue to be the most common MO in a violent crime in Sweden, firearm-related violence is significantly increasing in the country and foremost when discussing gang-related crimes. Moreover, firearm-related homicides and attempted homicides are increasing in the country. The studies also show that a firearm is much more lethal than a knife/sharp weapon... It is principally the three largest cities of Sweden which are affected by the many shootings in recent years."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Khoshnood|first=Ardavan|date=2018|title=Firearm-related violence in Sweden – A systematic review|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1359178918301022|journal=Aggression and Violent Behavior|volume=42|pages=43–51|doi=10.1016/j.avb.2018.07.008|issn=1359-1789|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to researcher Amir Rostami at Stockholm University. Police statistics for January-November 2018 showed that the number of shootings was at a continued high rate at 274, where up until the end of November 42 people had been shot and killed and 129 wounded compared to 43 in 2017. Rostami also said there had been 100 [[List of grenade attacks in Sweden|hand grenade attacks]] and 1500 shootings in Sweden since 2011, about 40 people are killed annually and 500 had been wounded. Rostami also said that if this violence had been attributed to some form of extremists, this would have considered a form of [[civil war]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.metro.se/artikel/polisen-varannan-skjutning-sker-i-utsatta-omr%C3%A5den|title=Polisen: Varannan skjutning sker i utsatta områden|work=Metro|access-date=2018-11-29|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost half (46%) of all shootings in 2018 happened in public spaces in [[vulnerable area]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s. According to to a police report, both victims and perpetrators are becoming younger.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.metro.se/artikel/polisen-varannan-skjutning-sker-i-utsatta-omr%C3%A5den|title=Polisen: Varannan skjutning sker i utsatta områden|work=Metro|access-date=2018-11-29|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accrding to police in 2018, at least nine people who were innocent bystanders had been killed in cross-fire incidents in the last few years and the risk to the public was therefore rising.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.metro.se/artikel/polisen-risken-att-oskyldiga-skjuts-till-d%C3%B6ds-har-%C3%B6kat|title=Polisen: Risken att oskyldiga skjuts till döds har ökat|work=Metro|access-date=2018-11-29|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A long-standing tradition of [[gender equality]] policy and legislation, as well as an established women's movement, have led to several legislative changes and amendments, greatly expanding the sex crime legislation.&lt;ref name="paradox"&gt;{{cite web|last=Nordlander|first=Jenny|title=Fler brott bedöms som våldtäkt|url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/fler-brott-bedoms-som-valdtakt/|publisher=[[Dagens Nyheter]]|accessdate=14 May 2014|language=Swedish|date=10 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="daphne-study"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Kelly | first1 = Liz | last2 = Lovett | first2 = Jo | last3 = Burman | first3 = Michele | author-link1 = Liz Kelly | title = Different systems, similar outcomes?

In its 2018 report, ''Nationella trygghetsundersökningen 2018'' (tr: "national survey of safety 2018") the [[Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention]] stated that there had been an increase in the self-reported number of victims of sexual crime among from 4.7% in 2016 to 6.4% in 2017. In the 5 preceding years there were escalating levels compared to the 2005–2012 period where the level was relatively stable. The increase in self-reporte victimisation was greater among women than among men. while the number of male victims remained largely constant over the timespan (see graph). The questionnaire pollls for incidents which would equate to attempted sexual assault or rape according to Swedish law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bra.se/statistik/statistiska-undersokningar/nationella-trygghetsundersokningen.html|title=Nationella trygghetsundersökningen 2018|last=|first=|date=20 November 2018|website=|publisher=BRÅ|language=sv|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Robbery====
The rate of exposure to muggings has remained relatively unchanged since 2005, according to the SCS, with 0.9 per cent of respondents stating they were the victim of such a crime in 2015.&lt;ref name="SCS2014" /&gt; There were 99 robberies recorded by police per 100,000 population in 2015, which is 3 per cent more than the previous year.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kriminalstatistik2012&gt;{{cite web|title=Kriminalstatistik 2012|language=Swedish|url=https://www.bra.se/download/18.6b82726313f7b234a581e31/1379673865503/2013_18_Kriminalstatistik_2012_webb.pdf|publisher=[[Brå]]|accessdate=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ref label|id1|Note 1|4}} The prevalence victimisation rates for robbery was slightly above the EU-average in 2004, and lower than countries such as Ireland, Estonia, Greece, Spain, The United Kingdom and Poland.&lt;ref name="2005-EUICS" /&gt;

A study published in 2000 by [[Brå]] on adolescent robberies in [[Stockholm]] and [[Malmö]] found that muggings had increased in the 90s, with approximately 10 per cent of the boys and 5 per cent of the girls aged 15–17 having been the target of a mugging. Desirable objects are mainly money and cell phones, with an average value of around SEK 800. Only half of the crime was reported to the police, and foreign-born youths were overrepresented in the offenders demographic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ungdomar som rånar ungdomar i Malmö och Stockholm|url=http://www.bra.se/download/18.cba82f7130f475a2f1800019941/1312278173315/2000_6_ungdomar_som_ranar_ungdomar.pdf|publisher=[[Brå]]|accessdate=17 July 2014|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Follow-up studies have shown the level remaining unchanged between 1995 and 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nya mönster bland unga kriminella|url=http://www.bra.se/bra/nytt-fran-bra/arkiv/apropa/2009-02-01-nya-monster-bland-unga-kriminella.html|publisher=[[Brå]]|accessdate=17 July 2014|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SCS indicate that 9.2 per cent of households fell victim to some type of domestic property offence, which is a reduction since 2006 (when the percentage was 12.6). Crimes in this group includes theft, theft from a vehicle, bicycle theft or residential burglary. Around half of the domestic property offences reported in the SCS 2013 are stated as having been reported to the police, and the overwhelming majority of crime victims state that this happened only once in 2012.&lt;ref name="SCS2013" /&gt;

Theft of personal property and pickpocketing are among the lowest in Europe, as is car theft and theft from a car.&lt;ref name="2005-EUICS" /&gt;

====Burglary====
Sweden had the lowest prevalence victimisation rate for burglary in Europe, according to the 2005 EU ICS,&lt;ref name="2005-EUICS" /&gt; and the rate of exposure to residential burglary has remained relatively unchanged since 2006.&lt;ref name="SCS2014" /&gt; In SCS 2013, 0.9 percent of households stated that they were the victims of burglary in 2012.&lt;ref name="SCS2014" /&gt; Sweden had 785 cases of reported burglary per 100,000 population in 2012, which is a reduction from the previous year by 6 percent.&lt;ref name="Kriminalstatistik2012" /&gt;{{Update inline|date=July 2017}}{{ref label|id1|Note 1|5}}
The majority of burglaries in Sweden are committed by international gangs from Eastern European countries like the Balkans, Romania, Poland, the Baltic countries, and Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hd.se/2017-01-30/kraftig-minskning-av-bostadsinbrott-ligor-skrams-bort-av-granskontrollerna|title=Kraftig minskning av bostadsinbrott – internationella ligor skräms bort av gränskontrollerna|website=Hd.se|accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total number of burglaries in southern Sweden were 5871 in 2015 and 4802, the reduction was attributed to [[Denmark–Sweden border#History|border checks introduced in November 2015]] due to the ongoing [[European migrant crisis]] and police having manage to catch a number of gangs in 2016. The third reason for the reduction was [[Neighborhood watch|community cooperation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sydsvenskan.se/2017-01-30/kraftig-minskning-av-bostadsinbrott-ligor-skrams-bort-av-granskontrollerna|title=Kraftig minskning av bostadsinbrott – internationella ligor skräms bort av gränskontrollerna|work=Sydsvenskan|access-date=22 July 2017|language=sv-SE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Burglary perpetrators =====
Since [[Police in Sweden]] has a low conviction rate for burglaries there is also corresponding ignorance about who the burglars are.&lt;ref name="neo_1_2014"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://magasinetneo.se/artiklar/darfor-kommer-inbrotten-med-hostmorkret/|title=(sv) Därför kommer inbrotten med höstmörkret|date=2014|publisher=Magasinet Neo|issue=1 - 2014|accessdate=4 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention]] received responsibility for compiling statistics in 1994, at which time the two main categories of offenders were youth and drug addicts.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} This pattern changed into one where the main category of offenders were organised gangs, some of which were composed of foreigners travelling to Sweden in order to commit crime and then return to their home countries again.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} In the [[Stockholm]] area police estimated in 2014 that a third of all burglaries were done by foreign nationals.&lt;ref name="neo_1_2014" /&gt; In 2015 police were reported as estimating that foreign gangs comprising 1500 individuals were organised with some members living Sweden to coordinate thefts: a third of these gangs are from [[Lithuania]], a fifth from [[Poland]] and the rest from [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Belarus]], [[Romania]] and [[Bulgaria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.svt.se/nyheter/over-halften-av-alla-bostadsinbrott-och-bilstolder-sker-av-internationella-ligor|title=1.500 personer ur utländska inbrottsligor kartlagda av svensk polis|last=Nyheter|first=SVT|work=SVT Nyheter|access-date=22 July 2017|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 police were reported as estimating that about half of the annual 20,000 burglaries, including failed attempts, were committed by gangs from the [[Balkans]], [[Romania]], the [[Baltic states]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].&lt;ref name="sydsv30januari2017"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sydsvenskan.se/2017-01-30/kraftig-minskning-av-bostadsinbrott-ligor-skrams-bort-av-granskontrollerna|title=Kraftig minskning av bostadsinbrott – internationella ligor skräms bort av gränskontrollerna|date=30 January 2017|work=Sydsvenskan|publisher=Sydsvenskan|language=sv-SE|accessdate=4 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Harassment ===
The percentage of persons exposed to harassment in 2015 was 4.7 per cent. This is an increase as compared with 2014, when 4.0 per cent stated that they had been exposed. Between 2005 and 2010, the percentage of exposed persons gradually declined from 5.2 per cent to 3.5 per cent. Thereafter, the percentage increased between 2011 and 2015 towards the same level as when the survey was commenced (when the percentage of exposed persons was 5.0%). Exposure to harassment is more common for women than men, and most common among the youngest in the survey (in the 16–19 age bracket). It is most common for the perpetrator to be unknown to the victim.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

There might be a correlation between rise in harassment by an unknown perpetrator due to the general rise of harassment in various online communities, but nothing conclusive. Most harassment reported is either women harassing women or men harassing men, the smallest portion of reported cases are men harassing women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=2014|title=Online Harassment|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2014/10/22/online-harassment/|journal=Online Harassment|volume=|pages=|via=Pew Research Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal sanctions==
Sanctions under the Swedish Penal Code consist of [[Fine (penalty)|fines]] and [[damages]], [[imprisonment]], conditional sentences, [[probation]], being placed in special care and [[community service]]. Various sanctions can be combined. A basic premise in the Penal Code is that non-custodial penalties are more desirable than custodial, and the court has considerable latitude when choosing a criminal sanctions, paying special attention to measures chiefly aimed at rehabilitating offenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Criminal sanctions|url=http://www.hogstadomstolen.se/Funktioner/English/Legal-proceedings/Criminal-sanctions/|publisher=[[Supreme Court of Sweden]]|accessdate=18 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sanction-system"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Swedish system of Sanctions|url=https://www.kriminalvarden.se/upload/Informationsmaterial/Sanctionssyst.pdf|publisher=[[Swedish Prison and Probation Service]]|accessdate=18 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fines and damages===
A person who has committed a crime may be ordered to pay damages to the victim. Such damages can relate to compensation for destroyed clothing, a broken tooth, costs for medical care, pain and suffering, or personal violation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Damages|url=http://www.hogstadomstolen.se/Funktioner/English/Legal-proceedings/Criminal-sanctions/Damages/|publisher=[[Supreme Court of Sweden]]|accessdate=18 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person sentenced for an offence that could lead to imprisonment must pay SEK 800 to the [[Crime Victim Compensation and Support Authority|Crime Victim Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Payment to the Crime Victim Fund|url=http://www.hogstadomstolen.se/Funktioner/English/Legal-proceedings/Criminal-sanctions/Crime-Victim-Fund-/|publisher=[[Supreme Court of Sweden]]|accessdate=18 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fines are determined in money, or as [[Day-fine|day fines]]. In the case of day fines, two figures are given, for example "40 day fines of SEK 50" (i.e. SEK 2,000). The first figure shows how serious the court has considered the offence and the latter figure depends on financial situation of the accused.&lt;ref name="sanction-system" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fines|url=http://www.hogstadomstolen.se/Funktioner/English/Legal-proceedings/Criminal-sanctions/Fines/|publisher=[[Supreme Court of Sweden]]|accessdate=18 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conditional sentences, probation and community service===
Conditional sentences are primarily intended when a person commits a one-off crime and there is no reason to fear that he or she will re-offend. Probation can be applied to crimes for which fines are considered insufficient. Like a conditional sentence, it is non-custodial, but it is relatively intrusive.&lt;ref name="sanction-system" /&gt;

If a conditional sentence is imposed there will be a probationary period of two years. During this period, the person must conduct himself in an acceptable manner. The conditional sentence may be combined with day fines and/or an obligation to perform community service. There is no check made as to whether the person sentenced has conducted himself in an acceptable manner; but if the person is found to conduct himself in an unacceptable manner, the court may issue a warning, change a provision, or decide that the conditional sentence should be replaced by another sanction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conditional sentence|url=http://www.hogstadomstolen.se/Funktioner/English/Legal-proceedings/Criminal-sanctions/Conditional-sentence/|publisher=[[Supreme Court of Sweden]]|accessdate=18 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A person who has been sentenced to probation is subject to a probationary period of three years. During this period, the person must conduct himself in an acceptable manner. A [[probation officer]] is appointed, who will assist and support the person sentenced. The court may specify rules about medical care, work and housing during the probationary period. The probation may be combined with day fines, imprisonment, an obligation to undergo care according to a predetermined treatment plan and/or to perform community service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Probation|url=http://www.hogstadomstolen.se/Funktioner/English/Legal-proceedings/Criminal-sanctions/Probation/|publisher=[[Supreme Court of Sweden]]|accessdate=18 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Community service is an obligation to perform certain unpaid work during a particular time. A person sentenced to community service serves his sentence through working, for example, for an association or a not-for-profit organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Community service and juvenile community service|url=http://www.hogstadomstolen.se/Funktioner/English/Legal-proceedings/Criminal-sanctions/Community-service-and-juvenile-community-service/|publisher=[[Supreme Court of Sweden]]|accessdate=18 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prison and electronic monitoring===
A person who has been sentenced to at most six months imprisonment has the opportunity to serve the sentence in the form of intensive supervision with [[Ankle monitor|electronic monitoring]]. The person sentenced will serve the penalty at home and may only leave home at certain times, for example, to go to work. Compliance with these times is checked electronically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Intensive supervision with electronic monitoring (foot tag)|url=http://www.hogstadomstolen.se/Funktioner/English/Legal-proceedings/Criminal-sanctions/Foot-tag/|publisher=[[Supreme Court of Sweden]]|accessdate=18 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A person who has been sentenced to prison will receive an order from the [[Swedish Prison and Probation Service]] to attend an institution. It is possible to start serving the penalty immediately after the judgement has been made, and in certain cases, the person sentenced can get a postponement up to one year. A sentence of imprisonment can, in certain cases, be enforced by the Prison and Probation Service with the use of an ankle monitor outside the institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prison|url=http://www.hogstadomstolen.se/Funktioner/English/Legal-proceedings/Criminal-sanctions/Prison/|publisher=[[Supreme Court of Sweden]]|accessdate=18 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prison sentences may not be less than 14 days and may not exceed ten years (18 years for some offences) or life imprisonment. A person sentenced to life imprisonment can apply for a determined sentence at the Örebro Lower Court. A prisoner has to serve at least 10 years in prison before applying and the set sentence cannot be under 18 years. However, some prisoners may never be released, being considered too dangerous.&lt;ref name="sanction-system" /&gt;

===Young offenders===
According to the penal code, persons under 15 who have committed a crime cannot be sentenced to any sanction. If the under age offender is in need of corrective measures due to the crime, it is the responsibility of the [[National Board of Health and Welfare (Sweden)|National Board of Health and Welfare]] to rectify the situation, either by ordering that he be put into care in a family home or a home with special supervision.&lt;ref name="sanction-system" /&gt;

As a rule, offenders between 15 and 17 are subject to sanctions under the Act on Special Rules for the Care of the Young ([http://www.riksdagen.se/sv/Dokument-Lagar/Lagar/Svenskforfattningssamling/Lag-1980621med-sarskilda-b_sfs-1980-621/?bet=1980:621 SFS 1980:621]) instead of normal criminal sanctions. An offender aged 15 and 17 years old, who have committed serious or repeated crimes, and is sentenced to prison or closed juvenile care usually serves time in a special youth home run by the [[Swedish National Board of Institutional Care|National Board of Institutional Care]]. A person under 18 years is only sentenced to prison during exceptional circumstances. In less serious cases, fines are levied.&lt;ref name="sanction-system" /&gt;

For offenders between 18 and 19 years of age, measures in accordance with the Act on Special Rules for the Care may only be used to a limited extent. A person over 18 but under 21 can be sentenced to prison only if there are special reasons for this, with regard to the crime, or for other special reasons. A person who is under 21 when a crime was committed may receive milder sentencing than that normally stipulated, and may never be sentenced to life imprisonment.&lt;ref name="sanction-system" /&gt;

There are no age limits for the application of conditional sentences.&lt;ref name="sanction-system" /&gt;

==Incarceration rate==
Sweden had an incarceration rate of 66 persons per 100,000 inhabitants in 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sweden - World Prison Brief|url=http://www.prisonstudies.org/country/sweden|publisher=[[International Centre for Prison Studies]]|accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is significantly lower than in most other countries.{{ref label|id3|Note 3|1}} By comparison, the EU average incarceration rate in the period 2008–2010 was 126 persons per 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=USA - World Prison Brief|url=http://www.prisonstudies.org/country/united-states-america|publisher=[[International Centre for Prison Studies]]|accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Crime trends in detail|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/Crime_trends_in_detail#A_steadily_increasing_prison_population|publisher=[[Eurostat]]|accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, approximately 12,000 prison terms were handed down — a level comparable to the one in the mid-1970s. The number of people sentenced to prison went down in the nine-year period of 2004–2013, but the average sentence length (approximately 8.4 months) has not been affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Allt färre döms till fängelse|url=http://www.bra.se/bra/nytt-fran-bra/arkiv/press/2013-05-30-allt-farre-doms-till-fangelse.html|publisher=[[Brå]]|language=Swedish|accessdate=18 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lagföring och kriminalvård – slutlig statistik 2013|url=http://www.bra.se/bra/nytt-fran-bra/arkiv/press/2014-05-28-lagforing-och-kriminalvard---slutlig-statistik-2013.html|publisher=[[Brå]]|accessdate=18 July 2014|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Image in media ==
There has been debate in the media about the crime rate in Sweden, and further debate about how crime has been affected by the accumulated immigration and refugee influx. Some international media have claimed that the refuge immigrants in Sweden created dangerous neighborhoods that are now "[[No-go area|no-go zones]]" for Swedish police.&lt;ref name=vice-no-go-zones&gt;{{ Cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_au/article/people-of-the-no-go-zones-talk-about-what-its-like-to-live-in-no-go-zones-726|title=People in Sweden's Alleged "No-Go Zones" Talk About What it's Like to Live There|newspaper=Vice|date=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several pieces by [[Norsk rikskringkasting]], the state-run media channel in the neighbouring country [[Norway]] have described the "no-go zones" as areas in which ambulances, the fire brigade and police are routinely attacked, with reporter [[Anders Magnus]] in 2016 threatened and hurled rocks at by masked men when he tried to make interviews in [[Husby, Stockholm|Husby]].&lt;ref name="nrk.no"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrk.no/urix/svensk-politi_-_-vi-er-i-ferd-med-a-miste-kontrollen-1.12920404|title=Svensk politi: – Vi er i ferd med å miste kontrollen|website=Nrk.no|accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrk.no/kultur/nrk-team-truet-og-kastet-stein-etter-i-sverige-1.12934238|title=NRK-team truet og kastet stein etter i Sverige|website=Nrk.no|accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journalisten.no/2016/05/kastet-stein-pa-anders-magnus-og-nrk-kollega-i-rinkeby|title=Kastet stein på Anders Magnus og NRK-kollega i Rinkeby|website=Journalisten.no|accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norwegian minister of immigration and integration [[Sylvi Listhaug]] and opposition politician [[Bård Vegard Solhjell]] said that they were "shocked" by the emergence of no-go zones in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrk.no/norge/listhaug_-_-sjokkert-over-tilstandene-i-sverige-1.12937020|title=Listhaug: – Sjokkert over tilstandene i Sverige|website=Nrk.no|accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This aggression is also directed at other official representatives of Swedish public institutions such as ambulance and fire brigade personnel.

In a February 2017 interview by US [[Fox News]] personality [[Tucker Carlson]], filmmaker [[Ami Horowitz]] said migrants in Sweden have been associated with a crime wave, and “they often times try to cover up some of these crimes.” Henrik Selin, a political scientist and deputy director of the [[Swedish Institute]], described these news reports of an immigrant-related crime surge as "highly exaggerated and not based in facts."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to Martin Gelin of the Swedish newspaper ''Dagens Nyheter'', “countless right-wing media in the United States that have long been reporting that Sweden is heading for total collapse.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Edgardo Leyva Escandón''' is a [[Mexican people|Mexican]] national and alleged career criminal. He has been a high-ranking member of the [[Tijuana Cartel]] (Arellano-Félix Organization) since approximately 1994. He has reportedly served the Tijuana Cartel as a personal assistant to its leaders, as a trained [[sniper]] to carry out [[assassination]]s against cartel rivals, and as one of the primary suppliers of [[weapons]] and [[ammunition]] utilized by the cartel.

== Bounty ==
Since the August 16, 2006 capture of [[Javier Arellano Felix|Javier Arellano Félix]], Leyva Escandón has kept a low profile and is still a [[fugitive]] from justice. In October 2009 all of his accounts were frozen under the Kingpin Act. The Act further prohibits anyone from conducting financial or commercial transactions with Edgardo Leyva Escandon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://narcoticnews.com/Drug-Cartel-Member-Edgardo-Leyva-Escandon.php Edgardo Leyva Escandon] ''Narcotic News'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Leyva-Escandon has been [[indictment|indicted]] in the [[Southern District of California]], [[United States]], for unlawfully possessing large quantities of ammunition.

On 22 October 2009, the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] sanctioned Leyva Escandón under the [[Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act]] (sometimes referred to simply as the "Kingpin Act"), for his involvement in drug trafficking along with five other international criminals and one entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DESIGNATIONS PURSUANT TO  THE FOREIGN NARCOTICS KINGPIN  DESIGNATION ACT |url=http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/narco_designations_kingpin.pdf |publisher=[[United States Department of the Treasury]] |accessdate=28 May 2014 |page=9 |date=15 May 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514025153/http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/narco_designations_kingpin.pdf |archivedate=14 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The act prohibited U.S. citizens and companies from doing any kind of business activity with him, and virtually froze all his assets in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An overview of the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act|url=http://www.assetsearchblog.com/uploads/file/drugs.pdf|publisher=[[United States Department of the Treasury]]|accessdate=28 May 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528053616/http://www.assetsearchblog.com/uploads/file/drugs.pdf|archivedate=28 May 2014|page=1|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Census1926.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Promotional poster to the 1926 Census]]

The '''First All-Union Census of the Soviet Union''' took place in December 1926. It was an important tool in the state-building of the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], provided the government with important [[ethnography|ethnographic]] information, and helped in the transformation from [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]]n society to Soviet society. The decisions made by ethnographers in determining the ethnicity (''narodnost'') of individuals, whether in the Asiatic or European parts of the former Russian Empire, through the drawing up of the "List of Ethnicities of the USSR", and how borders were drawn in mixed areas had a significant influence on Soviet policies. Ethnographers, statisticians, and linguists were drawing up questionnaires and list of ethnicities for the census. However, they also had the more ambitious goal of deliberately transforming their identities according to the principles of [[Marxism-Leninism]]. As [[Anastas Mikoyan]] put it, the Soviet Union was: "creating and organising new nations".&lt;ref&gt;"{{lang|ru|Национальный вопрос и национальная култура в Северо-Кавказском крае (Итоги и перспективы): К предстоящему съезду горских народов}}" (''Natsionalny vopros i natsionalnaya kultura v Severo-Kavkazskom kraye (Itogi i perspektivy): K predstoyashchemu syezdu gorskikh narodov''), [[Rostov-on-Don]], 1926.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Previous censuses==
The First All-Union Census of the Soviet Union followed two partial censuses carried out by the [[Bolsheviks]] following their seizure of power in [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russia]]. The first, the ''[[Russian Census (1920)|general census of 1920]]'', took place during the [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]] and the [[Soviet-Polish War]]. It was thus unable to deal with the [[Crimea]], much of [[Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic|Transcaucasia]], [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukraine]], [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Byelorussia]], Far Eastern, [[Siberia]]n, and Central Asian parts of the Soviet Union as well as with its Far Northern parts. Yet it is worth to note that there was only 15,000,000 population increase between 1920 and 1926 constituting in some 131,304,931 people according to the TIME magazine while is still undisclosed in Russian history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,786194-4,00.html Russia:Decennial. Overview of Russian life 10 years after the revolution by the TIME magazine] {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''1923 Census'' was restricted to cities. Prior to the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], the only [[Russian Empire Census]] was done in 1897.

==Methodology==
By classifying the population in terms of ''narodnosti'' (nationalities)—as opposed to tribe or clan—along with [[Lenin's national policy|policies which gave these nations land]], resources, and rights, experts and local elites were encouraged to interfere with the information collecting.

==List of ethnicities==
This list, called ''Programmy i posobiya po razrabotke Vsesoyuznoy perepisi naseleniya 1926 goda'', vol. 7, ''Perechen i slovar narodnostey'', Moscow 1927, was developed by the [[Goskomstat|Central Statistical Administration]] of the USSR.&lt;ref&gt;''Empire of Nations: Ethnographic Knowledge and the Making of the Soviet Union'' by Francine Hirsch, Cornell University Press, 2005, pp.&amp;nbsp;329–333&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''Garri'' originates from the [[Hausa Language]] in [[West Africa]]. It is used to describe any powdery material, especially foodstuff, such as flour grains, e.g., ''Garin Dawa'' ([[guinea corn]] flour), ''Garin masara'' ([[maize]] flour), and ''Garin sukkhari'' ([[sugar]]), and particularly fried [[tapioca]].&lt;ref name=gari/&gt; It can also be used for ground substances, as in ''Garin Magani'' (powdery medicine).

Types of flour foodstuffs mixed with water used to be a major part of the diet in the Hausa lands and almost all parts of [[Nigeria]], [[Ghana]], [[Cameroon]] and [[Liberia]] for many centuries. They were used by travellers in particular, who were often unable to carry cooked meals. Traveling on horseback or donkeys and trekking took a very long time and so required readily-available fast food. For example, while now it might take 75 minutes to go to [[Zaria]] from [[Kano]], 120 years ago it was a 5-day journey, and so one needed to take a large amount of garri.

The age of this ancient word in [[Hausa language]] can be realized by its occurrence in old proverbs and in the naming of towns and villages.
* ''Yaro da garri abokin tafiyar manya.'' "A young boy who has garri (powdered cereal) can journey with the elders."
* ''Wanda Allah ya zuba ma garin nono ba zai sha da tsamiya Ba''. "Who God powers his garri with milk, will not have to drink it with just [[tamarind]]." (Milk with garri was a luxury while [[tamarind]] fruit available in the forest can just improve the taste.)
* ''Wanka da garri ba ya maganin yunwa.''  "Taking a bath with garri is not going to cure hunger."



==Process==
[[File:Gari production 1.jpg|thumb|left|Garri production in Nigeria: peeling and washing.]]
To make garri, cassava tubers are peeled, washed and grated or crushed to produce a mash.  The mash could be mixed with palm oil (oil garri) before being placed in a porous bag. It is then placed in an adjustable press machine for 1–3 hours to remove excess starchy water. When the [[cassava]] has become dry enough, it is ready for the next step.&lt;ref name=gari&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.africanfoods.co.uk/gari.html|title=Garri|publisher=''African Foods''|accessdate=August 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is then [[sieve]]d and [[frying|fried]] in a large clay frying pot with or without palm oil. The resulting dry granular garri can be stored for long periods. It may be pounded or ground to make a fine flour.

'''[[Eba]]''' is a stiff dough made by soaking garri in hot water and kneading it with a wooden baton until it becomes a smooth doughy staple, that is served as part of a meal with various soups and sauces. Some of these include okra soup, egusi soup, vegetable soup, afang soup, banga soup and bitter leaf soup among others.

[[Kokoro (snack food)|Kokoro]] is a common snack food in Nigeria, especially in southern and southeast [[Nigeria]], especially [[Abia state]], [[Rivers state]], [[Anambra state]], [[Enugu state]] and [[Imo state]]. It is made from a paste of [[maize]] flour, &lt;nowiki/&gt; mixed with garri and sugar &lt;nowiki/&gt; and deep-fried.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.celtnet.org.uk/recipes/miscellaneous/fetch-recipe.php?rid=misc-kokoro-2
 |title=Snacks: Kokoro II
 |publisher=Dyfed Lloyd Evans
 |accessdate=2009-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Garri comes in various consistencies, which can roughly be categorized into rough, medium and smooth. Each type is used for a particular food.

As a [[snack]], Cereal, or light meal, garri can be soaked in cold water (in which case it settles to the bottom), mixed with [[sugar]] or honey, and sometimes roasted. [[Peanut]]s or groundnut with/or [[evaporated milk]] are sometimes added. The amount of water needed for soaked garri is 3:1. Garri can also be eaten dry without water, but with sugar and roasted [[peanut]] added.

In its dry form, garri is used as an accompaniment for soft cooked [[beans]] and palm oil. This food mix is called ''yoo ke garri'' or ''Foto gari'' in the [[Ga language]], in [[Ghana]]. Foto gari is the combination of moistened garri and stew, while yoo ke garri is garri with beans, a combination which is typically eaten as lunch.&lt;ref name=gari/&gt; It is also eaten with beans cake in Nigeria.

For a full meal, garri is usually cooked by adding it to hot water, then kneading it into dough. This is eaten with different types of thick, leafy vegetable stews, melon seed stews, peanut stews, or beans.

Smooth garri (known as lebu to the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]]) can be mixed with pepper and other spicy ingredients. A small amount of warm water and [[palm oil]] is added and mixed with the hand to soften up. This type of garri is served with fried fish. It is also served with [[frejon]] on [[Good Friday]].

==Variations==
In [[West Africa]], there are two types, white and yellow garri. Yellow garri is prepared by frying with the addition of palm oil to give it a yellow colour; white garri is fried without palm oil.

Many variations of yellow and white garri are common across Nigeria. One variation of white garri is popularly known as garri-Ijebu. This is produced mainly by the [[Yoruba people]] of Ijebu origin.

In [[Ghana]], garri is judged by its taste and grain size. The sweeter types with finer grains are more valued over sourer, large grain varieties. Commercial food vendors on the other hand prefer coarser grains with high starch content, as this yields more quantity when soaked in water.

Buyers often look out for crispier grains when trying to determine freshness.

==Consumption==
Garri can be eaten without further cooking, as a snack, by placing it in a bowl adding cold water, sugar, [[peanut|groundnut]] and milk usually called garri soakings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ofori-Mensah|title=Recipe: Gari Soakings Deluxe|url=https://omgvoice.com/food/gari-soakings-deluxe/|website=OMG Voice|publisher=OMG Voice|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, ijebu-garri is made with finer grains, and has a pleasantly sour taste, making it very suitable to be eaten in this way. In most parts of West African, sugar or honey is then added as well as chunks of coconut, [[Peanut|groundnuts]], [[Cyperus esculentus|tiger nuts]] milk, and cashew nuts.

In most garri recipes it is cooked by adding boiling water and stirring to make a stiff paste or porridge.  Eba is normally eaten with different kinds of [[soup]]s or [[stew|stews]]. Most parts of [[Africa]]  have an equivalent staple cassava dish. 

In [[Liberia]], Garri is used to make a dessert called Kanyan which is combined with peanuts and honey.

==Health implications==
Cassava, the root from which garri is produced, is rich in fiber, copper and magnesium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nutritional benefit of ‘Garri’ and ‘Fufu’|url=http://fooddoctors.com.ng/nutritional-benefit-of-garri-and-fufu/|website=Food Doctors|accessdate=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Garri is made from cassava which contains hydrocyanic acid ([[cyanide]]), which, in sufficient quantity, can lead to serious eye defects, intestinal issues{{clarify|date=March 2018}} and worsening of [[ulcer]]s.{{fact|date=March 2018}}  Proper and thorough processing of the Garri should reduce the concentration of the acid.{{fact|date=March 2018}} Cassava must be fermented for 7 days to prevent it from being a poisonous food.

[[Gender equality]] is the notion that all men and women should receive equal treatment in all aspects and that one should not be discriminated based on their sex. Gender equality is a human right and this is recognised by the [[United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR).&lt;ref name="udhr"&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/], United Nations Declaration of Human Rights.&lt;/ref&gt; The right to be free of discrimination on the grounds of sex is found pursuant to Article 2 of the declaration.

Gender equality is increasingly framed as being central to the realisation of both modernisation and economic efficiency, and its achievement presented as a key to good governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The New Politics of Gender Equality|last=Squires|first=Judith|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2007|isbn=9780230007697|location=|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the [[New Zealand]] government has implemented institutional mechanisms to promote the advancement of women and gender equality. In 2016, New Zealand was ranked 9th out of a total of 144 countries in the [[Global Gender Gap Report]] which ranks countries in terms of women's gender equality in the population under four heads: economic participation, health, education and political empowerment.&lt;ref name="gr"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-global-gender-gap-report-2016|title=The Global Gender Gap Report 2016|website=World Economic Forum|access-date=2016-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albeit, New Zealand has committed to support the work of the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] (OHCHR) and other key United Nations organisations in agreeing to uphold the UDHR. It has participated in human rights deliberations at the [[United Nations General Assembly]] and in the annual session of the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] (CHR) and proposes to support the rights of women, children and indigenous people.&lt;ref name="hist"&gt;[http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/politics/universal-declaration-of-human-rights], NZ and the UDHR&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, New Zealand ratified the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]] (CEDAW) on 10 January 1985, and its optional protocol on 7 September 2000. [[Ministry for Women|The Ministry of Women’s Affairs]] is responsible for administrating the CEDAW and its Optional Protocol. The committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women makes recommendations on any issues affecting women that the state should address. As of April 2015 the committee has made 29 general recommendations on issues affecting women that states should devote more attention to.&lt;ref name="ced"&gt;[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cedaw/comments.htm], Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women - General recommendations&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
In the [[World Economic Forum]]’s annual report on the global gender gap, New Zealand was ranked in 9th place in 2016. The Global Gender Gap Index ranks countries on how far women are behind men in regards to health, education and economic and political indicators. Instances where women are rated ahead of men are not counted as inequality.

New Zealand is party to the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD). In the OECD’s final report on Gender Equality in Education, Employment and Entrepreneurship it was found that women in New Zealand do more unpaid work than paid work, gain more tertiary qualifications than men and women-owned new enterprises outperform men-owned enterprises.&lt;ref name="jack"&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/newsroom/tacklegendergaptoboostgrowthsaysoecd.htm Gender inequality in New Zealand], OECD report 22/04/2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, despite the gap between wage equality slowly closing in, the report found that the government funding allocated to reduce gender inequality in New Zealand is on the low side in comparison to other countries in the OECD.&lt;ref name="jack" /&gt;

==History==
Throughout history, gender inequality has generally affected women more so than men. As a result, there has been a lot of controversy in respect of the matter and activism since the 19th century.

New Zealand has had a long history of promoting women’s equality. It was the first nation in the world to give women the right to vote in the 19th century. Previously, women were unable to vote until 1893 and were not able to stand for parliament until 1919. The first woman to win an election was [[Elizabeth McCombs]] in 1933. [[Iriaka Ratana]] was the first Maori woman MP in 1949 and Dame [[Jenny Shipley]] was the first woman to be prime minister in New Zealand from 1997 to 1999.

Historical inequalities for men include prohibition of homosexuality for men until the [[Homosexual Law Reform Act 1986|homosexual law reform bill]] in 1986 and military conscription.

==Legislation for gender equity==
The legal framework in New Zealand provides comprehensive protection against all forms of discrimination covered by the CEDAW.

In 1973 The Domestic Purpose Benefit (now the sole parent or jobseeker support)&lt;ref name="wi"&gt;[http://www.workandincome.govt.nz/individuals/a-z-benefits/domestic-purposes-benefit-sole-parent.html], Work and Income NZ, Domestic Purpose Benefit&lt;/ref&gt; was introduced for all parents caring for dependent children without the support of a partner (mainly women). The Accident Compensation Amendment Act 2010&lt;ref name="acc"&gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2010/0001/latest/DLM2417504.html Accident Compensation Amendment Act 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; also extended compensation to non-earners, benefiting women who do full-time unpaid work in the domestic home.

New Zealand has also enacted a number of legislative means to provide for equal pay for women, outlawing sexual discrimination and sexual harassment in the workplace and proposes to set out rights in regards to equal employment for career progression in the workplace.

Legislation in respect of gender equality in the workplace include the Equal Pay Act 1972,&lt;ref name="spa"&gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1972/0118/latest/DLM407770.html], Equal Pay Act 1972&lt;/ref&gt; the State Sector Act 1988&lt;ref name="sea"&gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1988/0020/latest/DLM129110.html State Sector Act 1988]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Human Rights Act 1993]]. 
&lt;ref name="bra"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1993/0082/latest/DLM304212.html|title=Human Rights Act 1993 No 82 (as at 28 September 2017)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.legislation.govt.nz|language=en-NZ|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="neon"&gt;[http://www.neon.org.nz/payequitymonitoringtool/legislationgenderequity/ Legislation for gender equity], National Equal Opportunities Network&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990]]&lt;ref name="nzbora"&gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1990/0109/latest/DLM224792.html New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990]&lt;/ref&gt; protects all New Zealand citizens from discrimination on the basis of sex.

=== Discriminatory laws ===
New Zealand still has some old laws which have not been repealed or replaced.

==== Abortion ====
[[Abortion]] is still listed under the Crimes Act 1961. Two certifying consultants ([[Physician|doctors]]) must agree that continuing the [[pregnancy]] would result in serious danger to a woman’s [[Mental health|mental]] or physical health in order for women to access abortion. Rape is not a grounds in itself for abortion in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.familyplanning.org.nz/advice/abortion/the-law-around-abortion|title=The Law Around Abortion - Family Planning|website=www.familyplanning.org.nz|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Male Assaults Female ====
Section 194 of the Crimes Act ‘assault on a child, or by a male on a female’ sets the maximum penalty for a male assaulting a female at two years and is not cover by the less restrictive 'bail as of right' provisions. The equivalent charge of common assault has a maximum one year penalty and is covered by 'bail as of right' provisions.

The Law Commission reviewed the Crimes Act in 2009 and recommended a repeal of this law and suggested that the maximum penalty for common assault be increased so that the more serious cases can still be dealt with appropriately.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawcom.govt.nz/sites/default/files/projectAvailableFormats/NZLC%20R111.pdf Review Of Part 8 Of The Crimes Act 1961: Crimes Against The Person]&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposed Family and Gandu Violence Legislation Bill&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-proposed-laws/document/BILL_72556/family-and-wh%C4%81nau-violence-legislation-bill|title=Family and Whānau Violence Legislation Bill|last=|first=|date=16 August 2017|website=New Zealand Parliament|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=6 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; seeks to address the limitations of using ‘male assaults female’ as a mechanism to address domestic violence, however [[Amy Adams (politician)|Amy Adams]] explicitly recommended keeping 'male assaults female'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.justice.govt.nz/assets/documents/publications/fv-reform-paper-3-prosecuting.pdf Cabinet Social Policy Committee REFORM OF FAMILY VIOLENCE LAW Paper Three: Prosecuting family violence] &lt;/ref&gt;

There are some other laws refer to ‘male assaults female’ which creates further gender inequalities. The Accident Compensation Act 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2001/0049/latest/DLM99494.html|title=Accident Compensation Act 2001|last=|first=|date=|website=Parliamentary Counsel Office|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=6 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; allows victims of certain crimes the ability to make claims for compensation for mental injury. Male assault female is one of those crimes. The Criminal Investigations (Bodily Samples) Act 1995&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1995/0055/81.0/DLM368904.html|title=Criminal Investigations (Bodily Samples) Act 1995|last=|first=|date=|website=Parliamentary Counsel Office|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=6 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; allows investigators the ability to take bodily samples from people accused of certain crimes. The gender neutral equivalent, common assault, is not included in those acts.

==== Infanticide ====
A woman can be charged with the lesser crime of [[infanticide]] if she kills her child and "the balance of her mind was disturbed". There is no equivalent for men. In New Zealand, there is at least one case of a man being charged with murder where if he was a woman he would have been charged with infanticide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Westway|first=Thomas|date=2001|title=Guilty But Substantially Mentally Impaired|url=http://www.nzlii.org/nz/journals/NZLawStuJl/2011/2.html|journal=New Zealand Law Students Journal|volume=2|pages=|archive-url=https://archive.is/TtqTm|archive-date=13 Jun 2018|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Otago University law professor Kevin Dawkins ... said he would like to see infanticide replaced with another partial defence of diminished responsibility, to apply to female and male offenders."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/73944874/when-mothers-kill-but-dont-go-to-jail|title=When mothers kill, but don't go to jail|website=Stuff|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Adoption ====
The Adoption Act 1955&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1955/0093/35.0/DLM293129.html|title=Adoption Act 1955|last=|first=|date=|website=Parliamentary Counsel Office|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=6 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; prevents males from adopting female children in certain cases.

=== Preventing gender inequality in proposed legislation ===
New Zealand has mechanism to prevent gender inequality in proposed legislation. [[New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990#Section 7 Reports|Section 7]] of the Bill of Right Act requires the Attorney General to report to Parliament if a bill appears to be inconsistent with the non-discrimination requirements of the act. However parliament is not bound by these reports.

Papers presented to cabinet are required to undergo a gender analysis by the Ministry for Women to determine the potential impacts on women and girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dpmc.govt.nz/publications/cabinet-paper-consultation-departments|title=Cabinet paper consultation with departments|last=|first=|date=|website=Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet - New Zealand Government|archive-url=https://archive.is/OcATH|archive-date=13 Jun 2018|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developments and present status==
In the past century the gender gap in New Zealand has been slowly closing in and there has been an increase in women’s rights and [[Feminism in New Zealand|feminism]]. The government is making steady progress and it is evident that the fundamentals for equal rights are all in place: democracy, the rule of law and an independent judiciary. The government has also implemented effective structures of governance, specialized human rights and other accountability mechanisms, and has recognised the vulnerability of particular groups and individuals.

Although New Zealand consistently ranks in the top half dozen of countries in the world when it comes to equality between men and women, it is not complacent in terms of gender equality. New Zealand women still do not experience the full equality guaranteed by the law. Across the economy women’s skills are under-used in leadership and women continue to earn less than men – even if they have the same qualifications, and similar job descriptions. Family violence also continues to be a cause of considerable disquiet.

However, many of the remaining gender gaps in New Zealand do not appear to be a conscious disregard to the law (as there is comprehensive legislation in place), rather it is largely based on subconscious prejudice and factors like [[occupational segregation]].&lt;ref name="cedaw"&gt;[http://women.govt.nz/sites/public_files/cedaw-2010.pdf The status of women in New Zealand], CEDAW report 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political and public representation===
New Zealand has had a high level of participation by women in public life and this is evident from the modest female representation in politics and the judiciary. However, women continue to be under represented in parliament. Currently, there is a 31% female representation in parliament.&lt;ref name="par"&gt;[http://www.parliament.nz/en-nz/parl-support/research-papers/00PLLawRP2015011/final-results-2014-general-election The 2014 New Zealand General Election: Final Results and Voting Statistics]&lt;/ref&gt;

At present there are no adopted quotas and targets to increase the number of women to ensure the equal representation of women in all publicly appointed bodies by the New Zealand Government. Rather, the government has developed a policy of ‘soft targets’ to promote equal representation. This was criticized by the [[Human Rights Commission]] as being insufficient as there is no dedicated machinery to guide it.&lt;ref name="hrv"&gt;[], Human Rights Commission (2011), p.14&lt;/ref&gt;

===Employment and the workplace===
The government’s current goals and priorities in terms of employment equality for New Zealand women are linked to its broader goal of improving New Zealand’s prosperity in the economy. This is to allow women to have more choices and opportunities to use their strengths to maximize social and economical success.

The New Zealand workforce shows a pattern of occupational segregation. For example, women tend to work in lower paying jobs, which contributes, in part, to the wage gap. Dangerous jobs are tend to be mainly male occupations, leading to significantly more workplace injuries and deaths among men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/73042995/grim-statistics-show-men-more-likely-to-be-injured-at-work-than-women|title=Grim statistics show men more likely to be injured at work than women|website=Stuff|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to pay equity, the domestic [[gender pay gap in New Zealand]] when comparing full-time workers is rather low in comparison to other countries. The gender pay gap in New Zealand was calculated to be 9.9% in 2014, which was the lowest in the Asia Pacific Region.&lt;ref name="mow"&gt;[http://women.govt.nz/new-zealand-women New Zealand women]&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of New Zealand labour force participation, the female unemployment rate is statistically higher than that of men (with the unemployment rate being the highest for [[Māori people|Māori]] and Pacific women). Women generally have higher rates of participation in all categories of unpaid work – within and outside of the household. The amount of part time workers in New Zealand are three quarters women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Grant|title=Women's Labour Force Participation in New Zealand and the OECD|url=http://www.treasury.govt.nz/publications/research-policy/conferences-workshops/labourforce/pdfs/lfpw-johnston.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various demographics of women take on more part time work than men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Grant|title=Women's Labour Force Participation in New Zealand and the OECD|url=http://www.treasury.govt.nz/publications/research-policy/conferences-workshops/labourforce/pdfs/lfpw-johnston.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 21 of the Human Rights Act 1993 prohibits discrimination in the workplace on the grounds of sex (including pregnancy and child birth), marital status and family status.&lt;ref name="bra" /&gt;

Gender equality is a topic in the workforce that has received increasing discussion and momentum. New Zealand started as the first nation to have full voting rights for women in 1893. From there, women entered the workforce in the 1960s, although the participation rate of men and women at the time was 81 percent and 67 percent respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Casey|first1=Catherine|title=Gender Equality and Corporate Governance: Policy Strategies inN Norway and New Zealannd|journal=Gender, Work &amp; Organization|date=18 February 2010|volume=18|issue=6|pages=613–630|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0432.2010.00514.x/full}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report from the New Zealand Census of Women’s participation in Government and Professional Life shows 60 percent of women have no position of the top 100 corporations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Casey|first1=Catherine|title=Gender Equality and Corporate Governance: Policy Strategies inN Norway and New Zealand|journal=Gender, Work &amp; Organization|date=18 February 2010|volume=18|issue=6|pages=613–630|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0432.2010.00514.x/full}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 63 percent of women’s work in New Zealand is unpaid, compared to 35 percent of men’s work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Zealand Women|url=http://women.govt.nz/about/new-zealand-women}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goals of the New Zealand policy is to achieve women’s representation in these organizations. Along with this, large corporations are encouraged to meet with the Ministry for Women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Curtin|first1=Jennifer|title=The Evolution of Gender Equality Policy in New Zealand|date=2014|publisher=Policy Press at the University of Bristol|pages=115–126}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand has utilized ways to further improve gender equality, by creating gender analysis tools so that various aspects can be further developed.

Feminists in New Zealand have developed their goal of creating greater equality for women. Equal economic agenda is a pillar of the [[Liberal feminism|liberal feminist]] ideas stemming from the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vowles|first1=Jack|title=A Bark But No Bite: Inequality and the 2014 New Zealand General Election|publisher=ANU Press|pages=25–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of these organizations is to create greater economic independence for women. The goal of these programs is to increase representation for women and help them gain further recognition in the economic sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Christie|first1=John|title=Women in New Zealand|journal=The North American Review|volume=168|issue=509|pages=509–511|jstor=25119180}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The development of different policies towards greater equality in the workforce is championed by the various women's organizations in New Zealand. The Women's Affairs is recognized on a national level in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Teghtsoonian|first1=Katherine|title=Disparate Fates in Challenging Times: Women's Policy Agencies and Neoliberalism in Aotearoa/New Zealand and British Columbia|journal=Canadian Political Science Association|date=June 2005|volume=38|issue=2|pages=307–333|jstor=10.2307/25165807}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ministry also created interactive relationships with different female organizations. The workforce has benefited from the government interaction with women's organizations and helped to understand the change in the various female demographics in the economic sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Meadows|first1=Richard|title=The changing face of New Zealand's workforce: More women and over-65s|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/better-business/79717875/The-changing-face-of-New-Zealands-workforce-More-women-and-over-65s}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commitment of the government to provide an equal working field is an important aspect of equality for women in New Zealand. There is a National Action Plan to implement UNSC Resolution 1325, which is dedicated to Peace and Security for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Zealand commits to supporting women’s education, leadership and participation, and improving women’s safety (updated)|url=http://www.unwomen.org/en/get-involved/step-it-up/commitments/new-zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
Generally, in education, women tend to outperform men and women tend to fare better in participation.

==== Primary School ====
In years 1-8 fewer boys than girls are meeting national standards according to 2015 figures.
* For reading, 73.9% of boys and 82.4% of girls are meeting national standards. 8.5 percentage points difference&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.educationcounts.govt.nz/statistics/indicators/main/education-and-learning-outcomes/reading-panui-primary-schooling|title=Ministry of Education - Education Counts|last=Counts|first=Education|website=www.educationcounts.govt.nz|access-date=2016-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* At level 3 girls are 14.2 percentage points ahead (60.0% vs 45.8%)&lt;ref name="Counts"/&gt;

==== Tertiary Education ====
Women are 60% of those who gain tertiary certificates and diplomas. Women also earn 60% of Bachelor degrees and above. 54.1% of STEM graduates are women, however women only make up 22.9% of engineering graduates,  27.9% of IT graduates, and only 11.1% of apprenticeships.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://women.govt.nz/documents/ministry-women-annual-report-2016|title=Ministry for Women Annual Report 2016 {{!}} Ministry for Women|website=women.govt.nz|access-date=2016-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Not in Education, Employment, or Training ====
Women outnumber men for 15 to 24-year-olds who are not in employment, education or training ([[NEET]]). In 2016 12.9% of women were NEET, compared to 10.1% of men.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Family Assets and Resources===
The Administration Act 1976 (section 77) provides for equal inheritance rights for sons and daughters and there is no evidence of discrimination in practice, or under any informal customary systems.&lt;ref name="aa"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1969/0052/latest/whole.html|title=Administration Act 1969 No 52 (as at 12 November 2018), Public Act – New Zealand Legislation|website=www.legislation.govt.nz|language=en-NZ|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Zealand women have the right to non-discrimination in the ownership and access to land. The [[Maori Land Act 1993]] provides for gender equality in the control and use of land and resources.&lt;ref name="mml"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1993/0004/latest/DLM289882.html?search=qs_act@bill@regulation@deemedreg_maori+land+act_resel_25_h&amp;p=1&amp;sr=1|title=Te Ture Whenua Maori Act 1993 No 4 (as at 01 January 2018), Public Act Contents – New Zealand Legislation|website=www.legislation.govt.nz|language=en-NZ|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of non-land assets, there are no restrictions on their equal rights to property, regardless of marital status.

Women also have the equal right to financial services pursuant to the Human Rights 1993.&lt;ref name="bra" /&gt;

===Health===
Women can access the same comprehensive range of health services as men, as well as having a range of services in place specifically designed for women’s health needs – such as maternity services and population screening programmes.&lt;ref name="cedaw" /&gt;

On average, women have better health outcomes than men and women generally have a higher life expectancy. However, there are areas in which New Zealand does not fare so well in terms of health. New Zealand has one of the highest [[Teenage pregnancy|teen pregnancy]] rates in the OECD with the [[Māori people|Māori]] teen pregnancy rate being rather high.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

==== Suicide ====
For the 2016/17 year there were 457 male suicides and 149 female suicides. The suicide rate per 100,000 population was 19.36 for males and 6.12. Traditionally the ratio is about 3:1 male to female.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://coronialservices.justice.govt.nz/suicide/annual-suicide-statistics-since-2011/|title=Annual suicide statistics since 2011 {{!}} Coronial Services of New Zealand|website=coronialservices.justice.govt.nz|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Life Expectancy ====
The New Zealand life expectancy at birth for babies born between 2012 and 2014 was 79.5 years for males and 83.2 years for females, which is a difference of 3.7 years.

A male New Zealander born in 2013 can expect to live for an average of 65.2 years independently,  and another 14.3 years with some level of disability requiring support.

Females can expect to live for an average of 66.5 years independently and another 16.7 years with functional limitations that require support.

At birth, therefore, females can expect to live independently for 1.3 years longer than males. They can also expect to live 2.4 years longer with disability requiring assistance than males&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.health.govt.nz/publication/independent-life-expectancy-new-zealand-2013-0|title=Independent Life Expectancy in New Zealand 2013|newspaper=Ministry of Health NZ|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Domestic violence===
{{further|Violence against women in New Zealand}}
The Domestic Violence Act 1995&lt;ref name="dva"&gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1995/0086/latest/DLM371926.html Domestic Violence Act 1995]&lt;/ref&gt; addresses domestic and family violence against women and pursuant to the act domestic violence can be charged as a criminal offence.

In New Zealand the government has implemented specialist family violence courts and means-tested legal aid services which provide referral and advocacy as well as applicant support and outreach for victims of [[domestic violence]]. The New Zealand government has made steady progress in implementing fundamental criminal justice reforms that strengthen victim’s rights and aims to provide greater protection for those at threat of family violence – most of whom are women victims of male violence.&lt;ref name="cedaw" /&gt;

The social attitudes in New Zealand currently remain an impediment to combatting [[domestic violence]] and as such, is one of the major barriers in achieving gender equity in New Zealand. In essence the relatively strong legal framework is not always effectively implemented and domestic violence continues to be a challenge for New Zealand society. It is estimated that only 18% of family violence cases are reported to the police and 84% of those arrested for domestic violence are men.

However the attitudes towards family violence in New Zealand are in the midst of change as a result of a sustained national campaign - The Campaign for Action on Violence within Families, which aims at changing social attitudes towards family violence. The government has also implemented similar programmes designed specifically for Maori, Pacific and migrant women which are endorsed by their communities.&lt;ref name="cedaw" /&gt;

Rates of partner and sexual violence against women had a statistically significant redcution from 2005 to 2013. "The annual rate of partner violence offences against women decreased from 8.6 percent in 2005 to 5.7 percent in 2013. The annual rate of sexual violence offences against women decreased from 5.2 percent in 2005 to 2.9 percent in 2013."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://women.govt.nz/documents/cedaw-eighth-periodic-report-government-new-zealand-2016|title=CEDAW - Eighth Periodic Report by the Government of New Zealand (2016) {{!}} Ministry for Women|website=women.govt.nz|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The latest New Zealand Crime and Safety Survey found that 4.4% of males and 5.7% of females reported one or more incidents of partner violence in the 12 months preceding the survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.justice.govt.nz/justice-sector-policy/research-data/nzcass/|title=New Zealand Crime &amp; Safety Survey (NZCASS)  {{!}} New Zealand Ministry of Justice|website=www.justice.govt.nz|access-date=2016-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gloria Maria Navarro''' (born May 2, 1967) is an [[United States|American]] [[Attorney at law|attorney]] and [[United States federal judge|Chief United States District Judge]] of the [[United States District Court for the District of Nevada]].

==Early life and education==
Born in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], Navarro earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in 1989 from the [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]] and a [[Juris Doctor]] from the Arizona State University College of Law (now the [[Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law]]) in 1992.&lt;ref name=whgov_20091224&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/president-obama-nominates-judge-timothy-black-gloria-navarro-district-court-bench President Obama Nominates Judge Timothy Black, Gloria Navarro for District Court Bench], ''[[whitehouse.gov]]'' (December 24, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, Navarro worked as a legal extern for United States District Judge [[Philip Martin Pro]].&lt;ref name="fjc.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fjc.gov/history/judges/navarro-gloria-maria|title=Navarro, Gloria Maria – Federal Judicial Center|website=www.fjc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional career==
In 1993, Navarro worked part-time as a mitigation investigator for a Las Vegas law firm and as a contract law clerk for several organizations. From 1994 until 1996, Navarro worked as an associate attorney for a Las Vegas law firm, and she then worked as a sole practitioner in Las Vegas from 1996 until 2001.&lt;ref name=whgov_20091224/&gt; From 2001 until 2004, Navarro served as a Deputy Special Public Defender for [[Clark County, Nevada]]. Beginning in 2005, she served as a Chief Deputy District Attorney for the Civil Division in the Clark County District Attorney's office.&lt;ref name=whgov_20091224/&gt;&lt;ref name="fjc.gov"/&gt;

==Federal judicial service==
On September 11, 2009, Sen. [[Harry Reid]] contacted Navarro to inquire about her interest in serving on the federal bench. After a video conference interview with Reid, the senator told Navarro on September 22, 2009, that he would be recommending her to President Obama for consideration to serve as a judge on the [[United States District Court for the District of Nevada]]. On December 24, 2009, Obama formally nominated Navarro to the vacancy, which was created by the resignation of Judge [[Brian Sandoval]].&lt;ref name=whgov_20091224/&gt;&lt;ref name=lvrj_20100211&gt;Carri Geer Thevenot, [http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/judiciary-members-query-lv-lawyer Judiciary members to query LV lawyer], ''[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]'' (February 11, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; On March 4, 2010, the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary]] voted to send Navarro's nomination to the full Senate for consideration.&lt;ref name=lvsun_20100304&gt;Steve Kanigher, [http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2010/mar/04/senate-judiciary-committee-approves-nomination-glo/ Senate Judiciary Committee approves nomination of Gloria Navarro for federal judgeship], ''[[Las Vegas Sun]]'' (March 4, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; On May 5, 2010, the [[United States Senate]] voted 98–0 to confirm Navarro to her judgeship.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00128 U.S. Senate Roll Call Votes 111th Congress – 2nd Session, Vote Number 128: Confirmation Gloria M. Navarro], ''senate.gov'' (May 5, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; She received her commission on May 6, 2010. On January 1, 2014 Navarro succeeded [[Robert Clive Jones]] as Chief Judge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Judicial Milestones|url=http://news.uscourts.gov/milestones?field_milestone_category_value=elevated|work=The Third Branch News|publisher=United States Courts|accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fjc.gov"/&gt;

== Bunkerville standoff trials ==
{{see also|Bundy standoff}}
In the first Bunkerville standoff case in 2017, Navarro declared a mistrial after a jury convicted two men of some of the counts in the indictment and reported that they were "hopelessly deadlocked" on the remaining counts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oregonlive.com/oregon-standoff/2017/04/verdict_reached_in_bundy_ranch.html, Partial verdict reached in Bundy ranch standoff trial in Nevada], ''[[Oregon Live]]'' (AP), April 24, 2017. Retrieved June 6, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; She scheduled retrials of the defendants in that trial for whom no verdict was reached, and trials of the remaining 11 defendants for June 26, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;Jenny Wilson. "[https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/bundy-blm/judge-declares-mistrial-in-bundy-ranch-standoff-case/ Judge declares mistrial in Bundy Ranch standoff case]". ''[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]'', April 25, 2017. Retrieved June 6, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; On August 22, 2017, the remaining 4 defendants were found not guilty, and set free after being held without bail since 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-investigations/2017/08/22/no-guilty-verdicts-bundy-ranch-standoff-trial/592019001/|title=Bundy Ranch standoff trial ends with zero guilty verdicts|work=azcentral|access-date=2017-08-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 8, 2018, Judge Navarro dismissed the charges against the remaining 4 defendants "with prejudice", meaning they could not be tried again for the same charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/01/08/576502739/judge-dismisses-federal-case-against-cliven-bundy-and-sons-bars-retrial|title=Judge Dismisses Federal Case Against Cliven Bundy and Sons Bars Retrial|work=National Public Radio|access-date=2018-01-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Greeks in Poland''' form one of the country's smaller [[Ethnic minorities in Poland|minority groups]].

==History==
[[File:Cerkiew w Zgorzelcu-2.jpg|left|thumb|180px|The Orthodox Church of Ss. Helen and Constantine along Lubańska Street in [[Zgorzelec]] was built in large part thanks to the support of the local Greek community.]]Greeks, particularly merchants and traders have been present in the Polish lands since the [[Middle Ages]], funding a number of [[Eastern Orthodox church architecture|Orthodox churches]] throughout the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. However most of these immigrants eventually assimilated into the diverse groups that trace their heritage from this polity such as [[Poles]], [[Lithuanians]], [[Belarusians]], and [[Ukrainians]].&lt;ref&gt;Topolski Jerzy (red) Dzieje Poznania, tom I cz. 1 do roku 1793, Warszawa-Poznań 1988, Państwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe {{ISBN|83-01-08195-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most self-identified Greeks in Poland today trace their heritage to the large number of Greek citizens who fled [[Refugees of the Greek Civil War#Poland|as refugees]] from the [[Greek Civil War]] and were admitted into Poland.
&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{citation|title=Ousted Greek Red on a Polish Visit: Markos, who led guerillas in Civil War, was believed dead or in prison; 10,000 Greeks in Poland|periodical=The New York Times|last=Gruson|first=Sydney|date=1957-02-07|accessdate=2009-04-27|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0612FD3C5F147B93C5A91789D85F438585F9}}&lt;/ref&gt; They consisted largely of former partisan units from the [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia region of Greece]].

Most had been farmers before their flight from Greece.&lt;ref name="Fleming"&gt;{{citation|title=Greek 'Heroes' in the Polish People's Republic and the Geopolitics of the Cold War, 1948-1956|first=Michael|last=Fleming|doi=10.1080/00905990802080596|journal=Nationalities Papers|volume=36|issue=3|date=July 2008|pages=375–397}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, from 1949 to 1951, 12,300 people from Greece came to Poland, of whom roughly one-quarter were children.&lt;ref name="Wojecki1999"&gt;{{citation|first=Mieczysław|last=Wojecki|journal=Zakorzenienie|volume=4|issue=6|year=1999|url=http://zakorzenianie.most.org.pl/za6/02.htm|title=Przemiany demograficzne społeczności greckiej na Ziemi Lubuskiej w latach 1953-1998/Demographics of the Greek community in Lubusz Land in the years 1953-1998|accessdate=2009-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most refugees arrived by sea through the port at [[Gdynia]]. The Polish government chose to settle them in the territories west of the [[Oder River]] near the border with [[East Germany]], especially near [[Zgorzelec]].&lt;ref name="Wojecki1999"/&gt; About 200 were also sent to [[Krościenko, Bieszczady County|Krościenko]] in the southeast, near the [[Bieszczady Mountains]] in a formerly ethnic Ukrainian area.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=From Gramos Mountain towards Lower Schleszia: Refugees from the Greek Civil War in Eastern Europe and Central Asia|journal=New Balkan Politics|volume=7/8|last=Troebst|first=Stefan|url=http://newbalkanpolitics.org.mk/napis.asp?id=19&amp;lang=English|year=2003|accessdate=2009-04-27|issn=1409-8709}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the refugees were celebrated as anti-capitalist heroes and given significant government assistance in building new lives and integrating in Poland.&lt;ref name="Fleming"/&gt; Initially, they found employment on farms, for which they were well suited because of their rural background; however, they later gravitated towards urban areas.&lt;ref name="Wojecki1999"/&gt;

Some refugees chose to return to Greece early on.&lt;ref name="Wojecki1999"/&gt; By 1957, still roughly 10,000 remained in Poland.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; However, suspicions later fell on them of being [[Titoism|Titoist]] agents. A large number were deported to Bulgaria in 1961.&lt;ref name="RFE"&gt;{{citation|publisher=Radio Free Europe Evaluation and Analysis Department|title=Yugoslavs protesting against alleged deportations of Macedonians from Poland to Bulgaria|series=Yugoslav Special|volume=1059/1061|date=1961-05-30|accessdate=2009-04-27|url=http://www.osaarchivum.org/files/holdings/300/8/3/text/5-5-139.shtml|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226110217/http://www.osaarchivum.org/files/holdings/300/8/3/text/5-5-139.shtml|archivedate=2012-02-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After a 1985 agreement between the governments of Poland and Greece that enabled Greek refugees to receive retirement pensions at home, the number of Greeks in Poland has deteriorated further.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The refugees belonged to different ethnicities, including half reportedly of [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonian ethnicity]] and speaking the [[Macedonian language]].&lt;ref name="RFE"/&gt; Two Polish experts in Minority Studies, Alfred F. Majewicz and Tomasz Wicherkiewicz, claim that the Polish government cooperated with Greek refugees in forcing Macedonian refugees to adopt Hellenic names, and prevented them from opening their own schools and organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Majewicz|first=Alfred F. |author2=Wicherkiewicz, Tomasz|year=1998|title=Minority Rights Abuse in Communist Poland and Inherited Issues|journal=[[Acta Slavica Iaponica]]|publisher=Slavic Research Center|volume=16|location=[[Sapporo]] (Japan)|url=http://src-h.slav.hokudai.ac.jp/publictn/acta/16/alfred/alfred.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950 the refugees from Greece were organized in the Community of Political Refugees from Greece ({{lang-pl|Gmina Demokratycznych Uchodźców Politycznych z Grecji}}), based in [[Zgorzelec]].

==Minority status==
In his essay, published by the ''Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights'', professor Slawomir Lodzinski states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
At present, the full legal protection is limited to this national minorities which are groups of Polish citizens, are “old”, “native” and on non-immigrant origin. This perspective has caused that the groups of Greeks and Macedonians who have been recognized as national minorities from the 1950s, from the beginning of the 1990s are not treated as national minorities by the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.minelres.lv/reports/poland/poland_NGO.htm|title=The protection of national minorities in Poland|last=Lodzinski|first=Slawomir|date=September 1999|publisher=Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights|accessdate=16 January 2010|location=Warsaw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Answering a question by [[Brunon Synak]], President of the [[Kashubian-Pomeranian Association]], at a meeting organized by the [[Council of Europe]] in 2002, Mr. Dobiesław Rzemieniewski, Head of the National Minorities Division in the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Administration, explained that Greeks and Macedonians are "not classified as national minorities since they do not meet the requirement of being traditionally domiciled on the territory of the Republic of Poland".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/minorities/3_FCNMdocs/PDF_1st_SR_Poland_Annexes_en.pdf|title=Minutes of the meeting with representatives of national and ethnic minorities concerning  the Report to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe on the Realisation by the Republic of Poland of the Provisions of the Framework Convention of the Council of Europe for the Protection of National Minorities|date=September 3, 2002|publisher=[[Council of Europe]]|accessdate=16 January 2010|location=Warsaw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''High Franconian''' ({{lang-de|oberfränkische Dialekte}}) is a part of [[High German languages|High German]] consisting of [[East Franconian German|East Franconian]] and [[South Franconian German|South Franconian]].&lt;ref&gt;Noble, Cecil A. M. (1983). ''Modern German dialects'' New York [u.a.], Lang, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;
Because of fundamental differences in structure, it is factually not justified.&lt;ref&gt;Glück, Helmut (ed.).  
''Metzler-Lexikon Sprache''.  Metzler, 1993, p. 442. &lt;/ref&gt;

It is part of the [[Franconian languages]] area, spoken southeast of the [[Rhine Franconian]] area.

It is spoken in [[Germany]] around [[Karlsruhe]], [[Erlangen]], [[Fürth]], [[Heilbronn]] and [[Würzburg]] and a small area in [[France]]. It is disputed whether [[Nuremberg]] in Germany belongs to its area. Surnames from the area of High Franconian include [[Bauer (surname)|Bauer]], [[Hofmann]], [[Merkel (surname)|Merkel]], [[Paulus (surname)|Paulus]], [[Schmidt (surname)|Schmidt]] and [[Schneider (surname)|Schneider]].

High Franconian is transitional between [[Upper German]] and [[Central German]] with similarity to [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]]. It is sometimes considered part of [[Central German]], or part of neither Upper nor Central German.

'''Hypersexuality is''' a [[clinical diagnosis]] used by [[mental health]]care professionals for extremely frequent or suddenly increased [[libido]]. '''Nymphomania''' and '''satyriasis''' were terms previously used for the condition, in women and men respectively.

Hypersexuality may be a primary condition, or the symptom of another medical disease or condition, for example [[Klüver-Bucy syndrome]] or [[bipolar disorder]]. Hypersexuality may also present as a side effect of medication such as drugs used to treat [[Parkinson's disease]], or through the administering of hormones such as [[Testosterone (medication)|testosterone]] and [[estrogen]] during [[hormone therapy]].
Clinicians have yet to reach a consensus over how best to describe hypersexuality as a primary condition,&lt;ref&gt;Stein, D. J. (2008). Classifying hypersexual disorders: Compulsive, impulsive, and addictive models. ''Psychiatric Clinics of North America, 31,'' 587–592.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bancroft, J., &amp; Vukadinovic, Z.

Hypersexual behaviours are viewed variously by clinicians and therapists as a type of [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] (OCD) or "OCD-spectrum disorder", an addiction,&lt;ref&gt;Orford, J. (1985).

==Terminology==
The ''[[Merriam-Webster Dictionary]]'' defines ''hypersexual'' as "exhibiting unusual or excessive concern with or indulgence in sexual activity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hypersexual|title=Hypersexual – Definition of hypersexual by Merriam-Webster|work=merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sexologists]] have been using the term ''hypersexuality'' since the late 1800s, when [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing|Krafft-Ebing]] described several cases of extreme sexual behaviours in his seminal 1886 book, ''[[Psychopathia Sexualis]].''&lt;ref&gt;Krafft-Ebing, R. von (1886/1965).

''Archives of Sexual Behavior, 39,'' 377–400.&lt;/ref&gt;  The author used the term "hypersexuality" to describe conditions that would now be termed [[premature ejaculation]].

==Causes==
There is little consensus among experts as to the causes of hypersexuality. Some research suggests that some cases can be linked to biochemical or physiological changes that accompany [[dementia]]. Psychological needs also complicate the biological explanation, which identifies the temporal/frontal lobe of the brain as the area for regulating libido. Persons suffering from injuries to this part of the brain are at increased risk for aggressive behavior and other behavioral problems including personality changes and socially inappropriate sexual behavior such as hypersexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robinson|first=Karen M.

==As a symptom==
Hypersexuality is known to present itself as a symptom in connection to a number of mental and neurological disorders. Some people with [[borderline personality disorder]] (sometimes referred to as BPD) can be markedly impulsive, seductive, and extremely sexual. [[Sexual promiscuity]], [[sexual obsessions]], and hypersexuality are very common symptoms for both men and women with BPD. On occasion for some there can be extreme forms of [[Paraphilia|paraphilic drives and desires]].  "Borderline" patients, due in the opinion of some to the use of [[Splitting (psychology)|splitting]], experience love and [[sexuality]] in unstable ways.&lt;ref name=beyond&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Stephen|title=Freud and Beyond: A History of Modern Psychoanalytic Thought|year=1995|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-465-01405-7|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Freud_and_Beyond.html?id=4ODr9mxI53oC|authorlink=Stephen A. Mitchell (psychologist)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People with [[bipolar disorder]] may often display tremendous swings in sex drive depending on their mood. As defined in the DSM-IV-TR, hypersexuality can be a symptom of [[hypomania]] or [[mania]] in [[bipolar disorder]] or [[schizoaffective disorder]]. [[Pick's disease]] causes damage to the temporal/frontal lobe of the brain; people with Pick's disease show a range of socially inappropriate behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cummings|first=J.

{{As of|2010}}, a proposal to add ''[[Sexual addiction|Sexual Addiction]]'' to the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM) system has failed to get support of the [[American Psychiatric Association]] (APA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2010-02-10-dsm10_ST_N.htm | work=USA Today | first=Rita | last=Rubin | title=Psychiatry's bible: Autism, binge-eating updates proposed for 'DSM' | date=2010-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2010-02-10/entertainment/27055937_1_autism-mental-disorders-mental-illness |location=New York |work=Daily News |title=Black Friday deals for Target, H&amp;M, Forever21, Old Navy, Radio Shack and more |date=2010-02-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727055212/http://articles.nydailynews.com/2010-02-10/entertainment/27055937_1_autism-mental-disorders-mental-illness |archivedate=July 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://health.usnews.com/health-news/family-health/brain-and-behavior/articles/2010/02/10/new-diagnostic-guidelines-for-mental-illnesses-proposed |title=New Diagnostic Guidelines for Mental Illnesses Proposed|publisher=Health.usnews.com |date=2010-02-10 |accessdate=2012-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DSM does include an entry called Sexual Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (Sexual Disorder NOS) to apply to, among other conditions, "distress about a pattern of repeated sexual relationships involving a succession of lovers who are experienced by the individual only as things to be used".&lt;ref name=APA2000&gt;American Psychiatric Association. (2000). ''Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders'' (4th ed., text revision). Washington, DC: Author.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]] (ICD-10) of the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), includes two relevant entries. One is "Excessive Sexual Drive" (coded F52.7),&lt;ref name="ICD-10"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thcc.or.th/ICD-10TM/gf50.htm |title=2012 ICD-10 Diagnosis Code F52.7 : Excessive sexual drive |accessdate=2013-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is divided into satyriasis for males and nymphomania for females.  The other is "Excessive Masturbation" or "Onanism (excessive)" (coded F98.8).&lt;ref name="icd10data_a"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icd10data.com/ICD10CM/Codes/F01-F99/F90-F98/F98-/F98.8 |title=2012 ICD-10-CM Diagnosis Code F98.8 : Other specified behavioral and emotional disorders with onset usually occurring in childhood and adolescence |publisher=Icd10data.com |accessdate=2012-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors have questioned whether it makes sense to discuss hypersexuality at all, arguing that labeling sexual urges "extreme" merely stigmatizes people who do not conform to the [[Norm (social)|norms]] of their culture or peer group.&lt;ref name=Levine1988&gt;{{cite journal |last=Levine |first=M.

Hypersexuality may negatively impact an individual. The concept of hypersexuality as an addiction was started in the 1970s by former members of [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] who felt they experienced a similar lack of control and compulsivity with sexual behaviors as with alcohol.&lt;ref name=Levine1988 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The '''ER - International Conference on Conceptual Modeling''' is an annual [[academic conference|research conference]] [[computer science]] dedicated to information and [[conceptual modeling]]. Since the first event in 1979 in Los Angeles, California, USA, the conference has evolved into one of the major forums for research on [[conceptual modeling]] and [[information retrieval]].

Conceptual modeling is about describing the semantics of software applications at a high level of abstraction. Specifically, conceptual modelers (1) describe structure models in terms of entities, relationships, and constraints; (2) describe behavior or functional models in terms of states, transitions among states, and actions performed in states and transitions; and (3) describe interactions and user interfaces in terms of messages sent and received and information exchanged. In their typical usage, conceptual-model diagrams are high-level abstractions that enable clients and analysts to understand one another, enable analysts to communicate successfully with application programmers, and in some cases automatically generate (parts of) the software application.

[[Iraq]] was one of the first [[Arab]] nations to embrace the [[Scouting]] movement, launching its program in 1921, just two years after the [[League of Nations]] had created the country out of the old [[Ottoman Empire]]. Iraq was a member of the [[World Organization of the Scout Movement]] from 1922 to 1940, and again from 1956 to 1999 before being reintroduced as a member again in 2017.&lt;ref name="World Scouting Welcomes the Iraq Scout Association"&gt;[https://www.scout.org/node/366936 World Scouting Welcomes the Iraq Scout Association]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Prior to and during [[World War II]], [[RAF Habbaniya]] maintained a Scout group for British and local boys.&lt;ref&gt;John S. Wilson (1959), Scouting Round the World. First edition, Blandford Press. p. 120 193&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, during the period when the '''Iraq Boy Scouts and Girl Guides Council''' ({{lang-ar|جمعية الكشافة و المرشدين العراقية}}) was recognized by World Order of the Scouting Movement (WOSM), the Mesopotamian nation had 12,000 Scouts, however by 1999, Iraq had been expelled from the WOSM.{{fact|date=July 2013}}

==Rebirth==
In late 2004, [[Chip Beck (Scouting)|Chip Beck]], a former [[Navy]] [[commander]] had the idea to try and restart Scouting in Iraq after serving there. The Iraqi Scouts Initiative committee was led by Co-Chairmen Beck and [[Michael Bradle]], an [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/cpa-iraq/pressreleases/20040301_scouting.html|title=IRAQI SCOUT INITIATIVE|work=The Coalition Provisional Authority|date=2004-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2008, a group of coalition military officers led by Navy chaplain [[Lieutenant Commander]] Andrew Wade sought to expand the Green Zone Council's model to the Iraqis living in and around the [[Victory Base Complex]] around [[Baghdad International Airport]].  Meeting with the Green Zone Council and their Iraqi counterparts, and spending several months building relationships with Iraqi civilian and military leaders on and around Victory Base, the group founded the Victory Base Council in April 2008 and began supporting troop meetings in June 2008.  Following the "Green Zone" model, the VBC is a loosely organized fraternal support group that enables their Iraqi partners to establish and grow a vibrant Scouting organization to serve local Iraqi youth. During 2008 the VBC built important relationships with local schools and worked with local Iraqi military and civilians to create a camp and community center where the troop meetings are held.  Continued growth of the camp facilities, and ongoing cross training of US and Iraqi Scout leaders are underway for 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorybasecouncil.org]  {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130416120306/http://www.victorybasecouncil.org/ |date=2013-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[File:HamorabiScouts Iraq.jpg|thumb|right|Assyrian Scouts in Iraq]]
Since the movement restarted in 2004, it has been taken over by Iraqis and is now run exclusively by them. Iraqi Scouts are involved in community service such as helping police with traffic control, giving first aid, cultivating cotton, planting trees and helping during natural disasters.

In February 2006, 18 Iraqi Guides attended a leadership seminar in [[Egypt]] organized by the [[World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wagggs.org/en/news/257 |title=Groundbreaking event for Guide leaders of Iraq |accessdate=April 1, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060710172555/http://www.wagggs.org/en/news/257 |archivedate=July 10, 2006 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; The association is currently listed as "working toward membership".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arab.wagggsworld.org/en/about |title=World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts Arab About Us |publisher=[[World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts]] |accessdate=2010-02-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100304005403/http://arab.wagggsworld.org/en/about |archivedate=2010-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scout Motto is ''Kun Musta'idan'' or كن مستعداً, translating as "Be Prepared" in Arabic. The noun for a single Scout is ''Kashaf'' or كشاف in Arabic.

'''Jan A.G.M. van Dijk''' is a professor of [[sociology]] and [[Communication Sciences|communication science]] at the [[University of Twente]], The [[Netherlands]]. He teaches and investigates the sociology of the [[information society]] and the social aspects of the new media. He developed one of the several existing concepts of the [[network society]] in his book ''The Network Society'' and extended the concept of the [[digital divide]] in his book ''The Deepening Divide, Inequality in the Information Society''. He reframed the concept from a focus on inequality of physical access to [[digital technology]] to a focus on inequality of digital skills (literacy), motivation to use and actual use of this technology. Afterwards he focussed on [[digital skills]] with research results published in ''Digital Skills, Unlocking the information society'', co-author Alexander van Deursen.

'''Japanese immigration to Mexico''' began in the late 19th century, to found coffee growing plantations in the state of [[Chiapas]]. Although this initiative failed, it was followed by greater immigration from 1900 to the beginning of [[World War II]], although it never reached the levels of Japanese immigration to countries like the [[Japanese American|United States]], [[Japanese Brazilian|Brazil]] or [[Japanese Peruvian|Peru]]. Immigration halted during World War II and many Japanese nationals and even some naturalized Mexicans citizens of [[Japanese people|Japanese origin]] were forced to relocate from communities in [[Baja California]], [[Sinaloa]] and Chiapas to [[Mexico City]] and other areas in the interior until the war was over. After the war, immigration began again, mostly due to Japanese companies investing in Mexico and sending over skilled employees. Currently, there are an estimated 30,000 people who are Japanese or of Japanese descent in Mexico including a recent migration of young Japanese artists into the country who have found more opportunity there than in their home country. It is the fourth largest Japanese community in Latin America.

==Beginning==
Japanese were among the Asian slaves who were shipped from the Spanish Philippines in the [[Manila galleon|Manila-Acapulco galleons]] to [[Acapulco]]. These slaves were all called "Chino", which meant Chinese. In reality, they were of diverse origins, including Japanese, Koreans, Malays, Filipinos, Javanese, Timorese, and people from Bengal, India, Ceylon, Makassar, Tidore, Terenate, and China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=[[Brill Publishers|BRILL]]|year=2010|location=|quote= |volume=|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=xrGShVU6VrgC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=acapulco+slaves++africa+india+malay+japan+timor+ternate+makassar&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TCU_U5_gOoSW2AWL8oHgBQ&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=acapulco%20slaves%20%20africa%20india%20malay%20japan%20timor%20ternate%20makassar&amp;f=false 12]|title=''[[The Chinese in Latin America and the Caribbean]]''|isbn=9004182136|edition=illustrated|editors=Walton Look Lai, Chee Beng Tan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2012|location=|quote= |volume=|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=bDIwZ8BieWcC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=acapulco+slaves+asian&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QyQ_U8XkJZWssQSUpoDYAg&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=acapulco%20slaves%20asian&amp;f=false 59]|title=Celebrating Latino Folklore: An Encyclopedia of Cultural Traditions, Volume 1|isbn=031334339X|edition=illustrated|editor=María Herrera-Sobek}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Königshausen &amp; Neumann|year=1993|location=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M25cDaIsFNYC&amp;pg=PA100&amp;dq=acapulco+slaves+asian&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WiU_U63aBKHg2QXW0YDgDw&amp;ved=0CFgQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=acapulco%20slaves%20asian&amp;f=false|quote= |volume=Volume 4 of Studien zur "Neuen Welt"|page=100|title=Slavery in the Americas|isbn=3884797131|edition=illustrated|editor=Wolfgang Binder|accessdate=2014-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Arnold J Meagher|year=2008|location=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H7dBmBsd-XgC&amp;pg=PA194&amp;dq=slaves+manila+asiatics+acapulco+1635&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Ayc_U8OCKebisAS_qYAo&amp;ved=0CCwQ6wEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=slaves%20manila%20asiatics%20acapulco%201635&amp;f=false|quote= |volume=|page=194|title=The Coolie Trade: The Traffic in Chinese Laborers to Latin America 1847-1874|isbn=1436309433|edition=|author=Arnold J.

Mexico was the first country to recognize Japanese sovereignty after the end of its isolation, signing a treaty with it in 1888 to allow citizens of both countries the ability to travel to the other and establishing consulates.&lt;ref name="terui"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kiyoko"/&gt; Mexico was the first Latin American country to receive Japanese immigrants in 1897, with the first thirty five arriving to Chiapas under the auspices of Viscount [[Enomoto Takeaki]], with the permission of Mexican president [[Porfirio Díaz]] .&lt;ref name="kiyoko"/&gt;&lt;ref name="centenario"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://zedillo.presidencia.gob.mx/pages/disc/may97/12may97-2.html |title= Versión estenográfica de las palabras del presidente Ernesto Zedillo, durante la ceremonia en la que declaró inaugurados los festejos de la celebración del Primer Centenario de la Migración Japonesa a México, hoy en la tarde, en la Asociación México-Japonesa, ubicada en la calle Fujiyama No. 144, colonia Las Aguilas, de esta ciudad. 12 de mayo de 1997.  |publisher=Government of Mexico |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=Stenographic versión of the words of President Ernesto Zedillo during the ceremony to open the celebration of the First Century of Japanese Immigration to Mexico, today at the Asociación México-Japonesa, located at Fujiyama Street 144 Colonia Las Aguilas in this city May 12, 1997 |accessdate=July 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These first Japanese communities mostly consisted of farm workers and other laborers. Japanese authorities were interested in creating a coffee plantation in Chiapas, for export to Japan. They established the Sociedad Colonizadora Japón-México to recruit Japanese farmers to migrate with government support to obtain land. Others went without government assistance and were called “free emigrants” able to buy land without obligation to the Japanese government. However, economic conditions in Chiapas forced many immigrants to abandon their contracts with the Japanese government and instead formed a new organization called the Sociedad Cooperativa Nichiboku Kyodo Gaisha which allowed them to diversify their economic activities.&lt;ref name="terui"/&gt; The very first settlement was based on coffee production but failed for various reasons including the fact that not all of the colonists were farmers and many became sick with tropical diseases. Many from this colony dispersed but there remains a small Japanese community in [[Acacoyagua, Chiapas]] .&lt;ref name="emendoza"/&gt; However, its establishment marks the first Japanese immigration to Latin America.&lt;ref name="kiyoko"/&gt;

==1900 to World War II==
Most of the immigration to Mexico occurred from 1900 to the beginning of World War II. Many of the immigrants in the first half of the 20th century were skilled laborers or illegal immigrants.&lt;ref name="terui"/&gt; Mexico Japan relations were superficial in the latter 19th to mid 20th century but immigrants to Mexico had favorable treatment, as Mexico needed additional workers for modernization efforts.&lt;ref name="emendoza"/&gt;&lt;ref name="peddie"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Francis Peddie |date=July–December 2006 |title= Una Presencia Incómoda: La Colonia Japonesa de México Durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial |trans-title=An Uncomfortable Presence: The Japanese Community of Mexico during the Second World War |journal= Estudio de Historia Moderna y Contemporánea de México |pages=73–101 |location=Mexico City |publisher=UNAM |issn=0185-2620  |accessdate=July 5, 2012 |url= http://www.ejournal.unam.mx/ehm/ehm32/EHM000003203.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Japanese immigrants in Sonora.jpg|thumbnail|Japanese immigrant workers at the mine of [[Cananea]], Sonora in the 1910s.]]
In the first decade of the 20th century, a large number of Japanese immigrants came as workers contracted to companies doing business in the country which needed skilled labor. This was first in the mining and sugar cane industries and later in construction and railroads.&lt;ref name="terui"/&gt; The main Japanese companies involved in this were Kumamoto, Toyo and Tairiku Shokumin Kaisha which did business in mining and agriculture. The three companies sent a total of 530 people to Mexico between 1904 and 1907. However, many of the immigrants could not do the hard labor of the mines and sugar cane fields, prompting them to abandon their contracts, heading to California or even [[Cuba]] .&lt;ref name="emendoza"/&gt; During this time period, the number of people of Japanese background went down in Mexico.&lt;ref name="terui"/&gt;

In 1908, Japan and Mexico informally agreed to end immigration by contract, but “free” immigrants continued to come. From 1914 to 1938, another 291 people immigrated to Mexico from Japan.&lt;ref name="emendoza"/&gt; Legal skilled laborers after 1917 often worked in the health fields, along with those Japanese invited by the Japanese community in Mexico. Most of these were in Baja California where the economic development was greatest.&lt;ref name="terui"/&gt; A number of other Japanese came to the country illegally from the United States, after being rejected by this country, coming to Mexico hoping to enter the U.S. again. These were mostly concentrated in the north of Mexico and those who could not re-enter the United States stayed in Mexico permanently.&lt;ref name="terui"/&gt;

Significant Japanese immigration into the [[Ensenada, Baja California]] area took place between 1920 and 1940 with only two known Japanese residents before that. Ensenada, [[Rosarito Beach Municipality|Rosarito]] and [[Mexicali]] attracted Japanese immigrants, legal and illegal. The number of Japanese by 1940 was about 300, most of whom worked in farming and fishing. Japanese fishing enterprises included the capture of lobster and mollusks. A significant portion of Japanese agricultural production was exported to the United States and even led to a Japanese-owned chili pepper dehydration facility for the same purpose.&lt;ref name="kiyoko"/&gt;

Before WWII, the highest concentrations of Japanese and Japanese descent were in Baja California, followed by Mexico City and [[Sonora]]. Most worked in fishing and agriculture followed by non-professional workers, commerce, professionals and technicians.&lt;ref name="peddie"/&gt; Up until the war, the treatment of Japanese in the country and their descendents had been favorable, very different than the treatment of Chinese in the country, which suffered discrimination and even expulsion in the early 20th century. The Japanese were relatively free from discrimination in Mexico, unlike the United States, Brazil and other countries in the Americas. One reason for this is that the Japanese population was not as prominent as the Chinese one in numbers and the work that they did, which included the construction of factories, bridges and other infrastructure was viewed favorably. The Japanese were not considered to be foreign exploiters, rather partners in Mexico’s development because of their technical skills in fields such as medicine and engineering.&lt;ref name="peddie"/&gt;

In Chiapas where the earliest Japanese immigration occurred in the prior century, intermarriage was common, breaking down ethnic barriers. This has led to the end of a distinct Japanese population in the state, leaving only family names as a reminder.&lt;ref name="peddie"/&gt; The official census of 1940s counts only 1,550 Japanese nationals in the country, the overwhelming majority men, although other studies put the number higher, as many as over 6,000. Even with the 6,000 figure, it pales against the number of Japanese in other countries in the Americas at the time such as the United States (285,000), Brazil (205,000), Canada (22,000) and Peru (18,000) .&lt;ref name="peddie"/&gt;

[[File:Kingo Nonaka.jpg|thumbnail|left|180px|[[Kingo Nonaka]] was a combat medic during the [[Mexican Revolution]] and later a documentary photographer of Tijuana. Nonaka along with other Japanese living in the Northwest were forced to move to the center of the country during WWII.]]
Japanese immigration halted by World War II to near zero, and those who were in the country were faced with restrictions and relocation after Mexico broke diplomatic ties with Japan in 1941.&lt;ref name="terui"/&gt; Japanese national and even those with naturalized Mexican citizenship were forced to move from areas along the Pacific coast such as Baja California, Sinaloa and Chiapas inland, with some forced into exile to Japan.&lt;ref name="terui"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kiyoko"/&gt; The goal was to keep the Japanese in Mexico away from ports and from Mexico’s border with the United States so that they could not be used as a “[[fifth column]]” by the Japanese government.&lt;ref name="kiyoko"/&gt;&lt;ref name="peddie"/&gt;

Japanese nationals were forced to move to interior cities such as [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]], [[Guadalajara]] and [[Cuernavaca]]. Most went to Mexico City and Guadalajara but there were concentrations in [[Guanajuato]] and [[Querétaro]]. It is estimated that about 1,100 people moved to Mexico City and Guadalajara alone. The Japanese community worked to buy properties to house the displaced including the former Temixco Hacienda near Cuernavaca which allowed the Japanese there to grow crops and live semi-independently. The fear of Japanese-Mexicans faded during the war, with some allowed to go back home before 1945 and the rest after.&lt;ref name="peddie"/&gt;

Mexico was one of a number of countries to take this action, but in the end only about 3,500 people were affected as opposed to 120,000 in the United States.&lt;ref name="peddie"/&gt; With some exceptions, those forcibly relocated were allowed to return after the war and retake possession of their property.&lt;ref name="terui"/&gt; However, in a number of cases, this proved impossible as people created new lives in the central states and/or they lost farming land and/or water rights to the unscrupulous. Those most able to return to their old life were the fishermen of the Ensenada area. This treatment of the Japanese is not in most accounts of Mexican history and is not taught in schools.&lt;ref name="peddie"/&gt;

One consequence of the war was that it caused many Japan-born to remain in Mexico, even if they had plans to one day return to Japan. The main reason for this was that the war completely destroyed the old Japan, and what they knew no longer existed. After the war, there was a strong division among the Japanese-Mexican community as to whether Japan had really lost the war, (with about ten percent refusing to believe Japan could lose). However, the division was enough to keep the Japanese-Mexicans from seeking restitution from the Mexican government or promote the memory of the displacement.&lt;ref name="peddie"/&gt;

==Post war to 1978==
After the end of the war, Japanese immigration to Mexico began again. From 1951 to 1978, this immigration was associated with Japan’s economic growth, giving it money to invest abroad.&lt;ref name="terui"/&gt; From the 1950s to the present, over three hundred Japanese enterprises have established themselves in Mexico and Japan is Mexico’s third largest trading partner.&lt;ref name="centenario"/&gt; These companies brought highly skilled workers into the country, usually on two-year renewable visas.&lt;ref name="terui"/&gt;

Since Japanese immigration began, it was a small and dispersed phenomenon, with few to no formal policies or support to Japanese immigrants.&lt;ref name="peddie"/&gt; Shortly before the war, many Japanese in Mexico began to form associations called “nijonjinkai” (Japanese associations) or “kenjinkai” (associations of people from the same prefecture). However, before the war, there was no nationwide Japanese immigrant organization similar to those in the United States. The closest organization to this function was the “kyoeikai” which arose in response to the displacement of Japanese during WWII, especially in Mexico City. Later, the leaders of these organizations would form the Asociación México Japonesa, which remains today.&lt;ref name="peddie"/&gt;

==Mexicans of Japanese descent and current immigration==
[[File:FumikosArt02.JPG|thumb|Japanese artist [[Fumiko Nakashima]] with two of her works at the [[Garros Galería]] in Mexico City]]
In 1997, descendents of Japanese immigrants celebrated a century of Japanese immigration into Mexico, with an estimated 30,000 people of Japanese nationality or ethnicity living in Mexico.&lt;ref name="terui"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kiyoko"/&gt; Despite the immigration starting in the latter 19th century, it never reached the numbers it did in other countries such as the United States and Brazil.&lt;ref name="peddie"/&gt; Japanese immigrant influence is strongest in Baja California, and can be seen in both the last names of many of its residents and the operators of [[maquiladora]]s near the U.S. border. There are still scattered communities of Japanese descendents from the first half of the 20th century in other areas.&lt;ref name="kiyoko"/&gt; In addition to the Asociación México Japonesa, there are some regional Japanese associations such as the Asociación Japonesa del Sur de Veracruz established in 1996.&lt;ref name="emendoza"/&gt;

There has been little research into this ethnic group in Mexico.&lt;ref name="terui"/&gt; The main researcher is María Elena Ota Mishima who has written various works on the topic, including the book Siete Migraciones Japoneses en México 1890-1978.&lt;ref name="terui"/&gt;
[[File:ImageFromShinoWatabe01.JPG|thumb|150px|left|Work by Japanese artist [[Shino Watabe]].]]
There has been one notable influx of Japanese into Mexico since 1978, which is young artists from Japan who have settled mostly in Mexico City. They have come because they have found it easier to develop their careers in Mexico, as the art market in Japan is very small and very hard to break into. More people in Mexico visit museums than in Japan and the range of artistic styles is much less restricted in Mexico. In 2011, the [[Museo Universitario del Chopo]] held an exhibition called Selva de cristal: artistas japoneses en México to promote the work of artists of Japanese and Japanese descent in Mexico. Artists represented included [[Luis Nishizawa]], [[Kiyoshi Takahasi]], [[Carlos Nakatani]], [[Kyuichi Yahai]] and [[Kiyoto Ota]] .&lt;ref name="artistas"&gt;{{cite news |title=México, espacio libre de creación para artistas japoneses: Hagino |author= Merry MacMasters |url= http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2011/02/13/cultura/a02n1cul |newspaper= La Jornada |location=Mexico City |date=February 13, 2011 |page=2 |accessdate=July 5, 2012 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Mexioc, free creation space for Japanese artists }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable Japanese and Japanese-Mexicans include theater promoter [[Seki Sano]], painters [[Tamiji]] and [[Tawaja]] and Luis Nishizawa.&lt;ref name="centenario"/&gt; [[Tanetoshi Kirawawa]] founded one of the most successful Japanese businesses in Mexico, and is also known for his philanthropic work such as the publication of books and magazines about Japan including Japónica and the creation of institutions such as Liceo Mexicano-Japonés, with teaches both Japanese and Mexican children, as well as the Japan study program of the Colegio de la Frontera Norte.&lt;ref name="centenario"/&gt;

As a result of Japanese investment in automotive and associated industries, there has been a significant influx of Japanese immigrants to the [[Bajío|Bajío region]]. The largest increase has been in [[Guanajuato]], which has seen a 400% increase in Japanese residents since 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mexiconewsnetwork.com/news/japanese-population-grows-guanajuato/|title=Japanese Population Grows 400% in Guanajuato - Mexico News Network|website=Mexiconewsnetwork.com|accessdate=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opening of [[Honda]] and [[Toyota]] plants in [[Celaya]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://uk.news.yahoo.com/mexico-auto-boom-fuels-japanese-culture-mix-165558360.html|title=In Mexico, auto boom fuels Japanese culture mix|website=Uk.news.yahoo.com|accessdate=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Mazda]] plant in [[Salamanca, Guanajuato|Salamanca]] greatly increased the Japanese presence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.elsoldesalamanca.com.mx/republica/sociedad/japoneses-hacen-de-guanajuato-su-hogar-396083.html|title=Japoneses hacen de Guanajuato su hogar|website=Elsoldessalamanca.com.mx|accessdate=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, branches of Japanese banks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mexicoindustry.com/en/news/guanajuato/japanese-bank-opens-an-office-in-guanajuato|title=Japanese Bank opens an office in Guanajuato|website=Mexico Industry|accessdate=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the first Japanese consulate-general in Mexico have opened in [[León, Guanajuato|León]].

'''John LeBoutillier''' (born May 26, 1953) is an American [[Political journalism|political columnist]], [[Pundit (expert)|pundit]], and former [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] from [[New York (state)|New York]], serving a single two-year term.

==Education==
LeBoutillier graduated from the [[Brooks School]] in [[North Andover, Massachusetts]], in 1971. He graduated ''[[magna cum laude]]'' from [[Harvard University]] in 1976, and earned a [[Master of Business Administration]] from [[Harvard Business School]] in 1979.&lt;ref name="harvardetc"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=L000547 | title = LeBoutillier, John, (1953– ) | publisher = Biographical Directory of the United States Congress | accessdate = 2008-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LeBoutillier first rose to national prominence in 1974. While still a college student at Harvard, he raised over a quarter million dollars for the campaign of former [[Vietnam War]] [[prisoner of war]] [[Leo K. Thorsness]], a [[South Dakota]] Republican campaigning to unseat [[Liberalism|liberal]] [[U.S. Senator|senator]] [[George McGovern]].&lt;ref name="appearancelist"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mystic-art.com/sandypr/leboutillier.htm | title = Biography: John LeBoutillier | publisher = Sandra Frazier Public Relations | accessdate = 2008-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, LeBoutillier has been an activist on POW/MIA issues ever since.

LeBoutillier's efforts on behalf of Thorsness caught the attention of [[Gerald Ford|President Ford]]'s re-election campaign and in 1976 he was appointed regional coordinator, responsible for all field activities in [[New Jersey]].&lt;ref name="appearancelist"/&gt;

==Member of Congress==
{{see also|97th United States Congress}}

LeBoutillier was elected to Congress in [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1980|1980]], representing [[New York's 6th congressional district|New York's 6th District]]. He defeated 16-year incumbent [[Lester L. Wolff]] to become the youngest member of the [[97th United States Congress|97th Congress]].&lt;ref name="youngest97th"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.maryellenmark.com/text/magazines/life/905W-000-016.html | title = The Freshman Congressman Gives Washington a Fat Lip | publisher = | last = Judge | first = Paul | date = December 1981 | accessdate = 2008-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served on the [[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs|House Foreign Affairs Committee]] and as a member of Special House [[Prisoner of war|POW]]/[[Missing in action|MIA]] Task Force. After redistricting in 1982, LeBoutillier ran unsuccessfully for re-election versus [[Robert J. Mrazek]] in [[New York's 3rd congressional district]].  In 1983, LeBoutillier was fined $7,000 by the Federal Election Commission for violating federal election laws during the course of his 1980 congressional campaign. With contributions by individuals limited to $1,000 per person, LeBoutillier accepted a $200,500 contribution from his mother. LeBoutillier's mother was also fined $7,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=U.S. Election Panel Fines LeBoutillier |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/06/nyregion/the-region-uselectionpanel-fines-leboutillier.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |issn=0362-4331 |oclc=1645522 |date=December 6, 1983 |at=The Region |accessdate=November 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political commentator==
Upon leaving Congress, LeBoutillier continued to be active on the [[Vietnam War POW/MIA issue]]. He founded the Sky Hook II Project, dedicated to recovering living American POWs in [[Southeast Asia]]. He has made frequent trips to [[Laos]] and [[Vietnam]] and also met with Lao and Vietnamese leaders in [[Hanoi]], [[Ho Chi Minh City]], [[Jakarta]], [[New York City]], [[Vientiane]], and [[Paris]].

LeBoutillier is a frequent guest on radio and television and has hosted [[Talk radio|radio talk show]] programs on [[WMCA (AM)|WMCA]] radio and [[WABC (AM)|WABC]] radio. He conducted an exclusive television [[interview]] with [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] for [[NBC]]'s ''[[Tomorrow (TV series)|Tomorrow Show]]'' in 1981, and interviewed [[Richard Nixon]] for [[Citadel Media|ABC Radio]] in 1984. The interview was Nixon's first live network radio appearance since [[Watergate scandal|leaving the White House]]. He has been a frequent guest commentator on ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]'', ''[[20/20 (US television series)|20/20]]'', ''[[Nightline (US news program)|Nightline]]'', ''[[Crossfire (U.S. TV program)|Crossfire]]'', and ''[[Imus in the Morning]]''.&lt;ref name="appearancelist"/&gt; In 2004, he appeared on [[The Daily Show with Jon Stewart]] to discuss his plans to build a "Counter-Clinton Library" in [[Little Rock]] near the [[Clinton Presidential Center|Clinton Presidential Library]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/wed-july-14-2004/true-library ''Daily Show'' appearance]&lt;/ref&gt;

He joined with noted Canadian broadcaster [[Arlene Bynon]] in December 2010, to launch ''Bynon/LeBoutillier'', a [[talk radio]] show simultaneously airing on [[WABC (AM)|WABC]] in New York City and [[CFMJ|AM640]] in [[Toronto]] while also airing in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.wabcradio.com/showdj.asp?DJID=58563 | title = Byron/Leboutillier | publisher = [[Citadel Broadcasting|Citadel Broadcasting Company]] | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110726170936/http://www.wabcradio.com/showdj.asp?DJID=58563 | archivedate = 2011-07-26 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2007, LeBoutillier has been a columnist at [[Newsmax|NewsMax.com]].&lt;ref name="newsmaxbio"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.newsmax.com/john_leboutillier/bio/ | title = John LeBoutillier Biography | publisher = NewsMax.com | accessdate = 2008-11-18 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080604005954/http://www.newsmax.com/john_leboutillier/bio/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a regular guest on [[George Galloway]]'s radio show on [[United Kingdom|Britain]]'s [[talkSPORT]], and more recently Galloway's [[talkRADIO]] show. He was critical of the [[George W. Bush]] administration, challenging the administration on its [[Iraqi War]] policies and the failure to halt the tide of [[illegal immigration]]. He was vocal in his opposition to the nomination of [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[John McCain]] as the Republican candidate in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential election]], in part due to McCain's failure to acknowledge evidence of live American POWs left behind following the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name="enormouscrime"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsmax.com/john_leboutillier/vietnam_pows/2008/09/05/128048.html |title='Enormous Crime' Details POWs Left Behind |publisher=NewMax.com |last=LeBoutillier |first=John |date=2008-09-05 |accessdate=2008-11-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922011852/http://www.newsmax.com/john_leboutillier/vietnam_pows/2008/09/05/128048.html |archivedate=September 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A gypsy family (5078753120).jpg|thumb|A Welsh Romani family, 1951]]
The '''Kale''' (also '''Kalá''', '''Valshanange''') are a group of [[Romani people]] in [[Wales]]. Many claim to be descendants of [[King of the Gypsies#Abram Wood|Abram Wood]], who was the first Romani to reside permanently and exclusively in Wales in the early 18th century, though Romanies have appeared in Wales since the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.valleystream.co.uk/romany-welsh%20.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621144356/http://www.valleystream.co.uk/romany-welsh%20.htm |archivedate=2008-06-21 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; Generally speaking, the Kale have employed a tribal structure in which a group of several family units would be under the authority of a male chieftain. However some Kale families are matriarchal with a senior woman being chosen by consensus among the other women of the family to take the leadership role.

==Language==
The Kale spoke [[Welsh Romani]]. Originally the variants of Welsh Romani and the [[Angloromani]] of the [[Romanichal]] constituted a common "British Romani" language.&lt;ref&gt;Sampson. J. (1926) ''The Dialect of the Gypsies of Wales.'' Oxford: Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Welsh and English Romani share characteristics and are historically closely related to Romani dialects spoken in France, Germany ([[Sinti]]), Scandinavia, Spain, Poland, North Russia and the Baltic states. Such dialects are descended from the first wave of Romani immigrants into western, northern and southern Europe in the late Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Bakker (1997) Review of McGowan, ''The Winchester Confessions'', ''Journal of the [[Gypsy Lore Society]]'', Fifth series 7(1): 49-50.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Welsh Romani language survived in North Wales until at least 1950; in South Wales, a sort of "[[pidgin]]" dialect arose in the late 19th century, mostly consisting of Romani and English but with other loanwords from various languages (Arabic, Iranian, Greek, Romanian, German, French and Welsh) that indicate the long journey of the Kale.

==Integration into Welsh culture==
While preserving their travelling lifestyle the Kale grew to claim several aspects of Welsh culture, including conversion to Christianity, taking on Welsh surnames, and participating in regional and national [[eisteddfodau]]. Notably, John Robert Lewis, the husband of Abram Wood's granddaughter, would win prizes for harping in 1842, 1848 and 1850. 

Another descendant, John Roberts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yba.llgc.org.uk/en/s-ROBE-JOH-1816.html|title=The National Library of Wales :: Dictionary of Welsh Biography|website=Yba.llgc.org.uk|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; earned the sobriquet "Telynor Cymru", and taught his whole family various instruments.  His illustrious career culminated in a performance before [[Queen Victoria]] at the [[Llandderfel#Palé Hall|Palé Hall]] on 24 August 1889 on the occasion of the Royal Visit to Wales. John Roberts played with his nine sons, all of them on the harp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=John Roberts, Telynor Cymru |last=Roberts |first=E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1191">The '''Kore''' of Lamu are a small people living on [[Lamu Island]] on the northern Kenya coast. In 1985 they numbered between 200 and 250 people (Curtin 1985). Their history before 1870 lies with the other [[Maa people]]s in central Kenya. After being defeated by the Purko Maasai in the 1870s, the Kore fled to north-eastern Kenya where they were taken captive by [[Somali people|Somali]] people. After functioning for years as clients or slaves in Somali households, they were set free by British imperial forces around the end of the 19th century. Loss of cattle brought them to Lamu island in the second half of the 20th century. They have lost their own language, a [[Maa languages|Maa]] variety, and speak [[Somali language|Somali]] nowadays. They have adopted many Somali customs.

{{Former monarchic orders of succession}}

The [[Monarchy of Iraq|Iraqi monarchy]] was [[Monarchy abolishment|abolished]] by the then-ruling [[Iraqi Republic (1958–68)|Republican regime]] on 14 July 1958 by [[Abd al-Karim Qasim]] in a [[14 July Revolution|coup d'état]].

The current [[pretender]] to the defunct throne of Iraq and Syria is [[Prince Ra'ad bin Zeid]].

==Law of succession==
According to Articles 19 and 20 to the 1925 Constitution: The sovereignty of the constitutional [[Kingdom of Iraq]] resides in the people. It is a trust confided by them to [[Faisal I of Iraq|King Faisal I]], son of [[Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca|Hussein]], and to his heirs after him. The Heir Apparent shall be the eldest son of the King, in direct line, in accordance with the provisions of the law of succession.

The Constitution was amended in 1943 with Article 19 remaining the same and Article 20 stating; The Heir Apparent shall be the eldest son of the King, in direct line, in accordance with the provisions of the law of succession. If there was no Heir Apparent according to the line of succession, the ablest adult male Iraqi of the eldest sons of the [[Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca|King Hussein bin Ali]] shall be heir until there is an Heir Apparent.

Females were excluded from the line of succession.

The '''Lun Bawang''' (formerly known as '''Trusan Murut''' or '''Southern Murut''') is an ethnic group found in Central Northern [[Borneo]]. They are indigenous to the highlands of [[North Kalimantan]] ([[Krayan]], [[Malinau Regency|Malinau]], [[Kayan Mentarang National Park|Mentarang]] and Long Bawan), [[Brunei]] ([[Temburong District]]), southwest of [[Sabah]] ([[Interior Division]]) and northern region of [[Sarawak]] ([[Limbang Division]]). In the Malaysian state of Sarawak, the Lun Bawang (through the term ''Murut'') are officially recognised by the Constitution as native of Sarawak&lt;ref name = "Constitution of Malaysia"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and are categorised under the [[Orang Ulu]] people; whilst in the neighbouring state of Sabah and [[Krayan|Krayan highland]] in Kalimantan, they are sometimes named ''Lundayeh'' or ''Lun Daye''. In Brunei, they are also identified by law as one of the 7 natives (indigenous people) of Brunei, through the term ''Murut''.&lt;ref name = "Laws of Brunei"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, in Sabah, Kalimantan and Brunei, the term Lun Bawang is gaining popularity as a unifying term for this ethnic across all region.  There are also other alternative names such as Lun Lod, Lun Baa' and Lun Tana Luun.

Lun Bawang people are traditionally agriculturalists and practise [[animal husbandry]] such as rearing [[poultry]], [[pigs]] and [[domestic buffalo|buffaloes]]. Lun Bawangs are also known to be hunters and fisherman.

==Etymology==
[[File:Translation of the word "Bawang" in Lun Bawang language.png|thumb|upright|Translation of the word "Bawang" as recorded by [[Spencer St. John]] in 1862.]]

The word Lun Bawang means ''people of the country'' or ''native people'', whilst Lun Dayeh means ''upriver people'' or ''people of the interior'' or ''[[Orang Ulu]]'' and Lun Lod means ''people living downriver or near the sea''. Other names are derived from geographical reference to their rice cultivation, for example Lun Baa' (swamps) who lives near swampy areas and grow wet rice, and Lun Tana' Luun (on the land) who cultivates dry rice.

While insisting that they never called themselves ''Murut'', the Lun Bawangs were formerly identified as ''Murut'' by the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[colonist]]s and by outsiders (other ethnic group).&lt;ref name = "Daniel Chew"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Lun Bawang language]], the word ''Murut'' either means 'to massage' or 'to give dowry', and these meanings have little or no relation at all to the identity of the people.&lt;ref name = "Meechang Tuie"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The name Murut might have been derived from the word [[Mount Murud|"Murud"]], a mountain located near an old Lun Bawang settlement, hence might have just meant 'mountain men' or 'hill people' but was instead used by the colonist to identify this ethnic.

In addition to that, [[ethnologist]] found that the classification under the name [[Murut people|Murut]] is confusing as the term is used differently in Sabah, Sarawak and Brunei, that is whilst in Brunei and Sarawak it is used to describe the Lun Bawang people, in Sabah it is used to identify an ethnic group that is linguistically and culturally different from the Lun Bawangs.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.brunet.bn/news/pelita/15nov/sasbuday.htm Pelita Brunei - Sastera dan Budaya&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070627153124/http://www.brunet.bn/news/pelita/15nov/sasbuday.htm |date=27 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Appel, G.M."&gt;

In the early 1970s, the use of the term ''Lun Bawang'' began to gain popularity amongst ethnologist and linguist, and it is now the most commonly used term to identify this ethnic group. In Sarawak, the decision to replace the term 'Murut' to 'Lun Bawang' to identify this ethnic group was made unanimously by Lun Bawang community leaders,&lt;ref name = "Meechang Tuie" /&gt; and the official usage of this term is now legally binding following the passing of Interpretation Act by Sarawak's Legislative Assembly in 2002.&lt;ref name="Abdul Hakim Bujang"&gt;

==Origin==
The Lun Bawangs made up of one of the ethnic natives that occupied the Borneo Island for centuries. According to [[Tom Harrisson]] (1959) and [[S. Runciman]] (1960), the Lun Bawang Community is one of the earlier settlers in the mountainous regions of central Borneo and they are related to the [[Kelabit people|Kelabit]] tribe. Both tribe are linked to a common lineage termed the ''Apo Duat'' or "Apad Uat" people, of which ''Apo Duat'' is the area consisting of the [[Krayan|Krayan highland]] and [[Kelabit Highlands]].
&lt;!--The Kelabit people, who has close similarity to the Lun Bawang people, maintain that Lun Bawang people were once Kelabit people who originally resides the [[Kelabit Highlands|Kerayan-Kelabit highland]] of Central Northeast Borneo. (This statement is biased and untrue. It is only fair to say that the kelabit (minority) was once Lun Bawang (majority) and not the other way round). In the seventeenth and eighteenth century, they gradually migrated to the low lands near today's Sabah, Sarawak and Brunei.--&gt;

One theory suggests that Apo Duat is the homeland of this common ancestor, and that they have expanded out to the coastal area.&lt;ref name = "Reed L. Wadley"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The migration of these people to the low lands and gradual spreading out might have been spurred by various waves of migration of the Lun Bawang people from different clans. The migration of Lun Bawang people from one clan to a region already inhabited by another clan, causes the latter to move to another region, despite them having similar culture and language. The strong clan identity of the Lun Bawang people is shown by their common tradition of identifying themselves based on their village or geographical location, for example, 'Lun Adang' who once resides the Adang river basin or 'Lun Kemaloh' who comes from the Kemaloh river. &lt;!-- This is by no means exclusive to the Lun Bawangs as various ethnics in Borneo identify themselves more based on their locations of dwelling rahter than the Western notion of ethnic labelling http://www.kitlv-journals.nl/files/pdf/art_BKI_1681.pdf --&gt;

One other theory suggests that these Apo Duat people were once natives of old Brunei, but were pushed upriver into the highlands by the invading tribes such as [[Kayan (Borneo)|Kayan]], [[Kenyah people|Kenyah]] and [[Iban people|Iban]] people. The ones that remained downriver (Lun Bawang people) were isolated from the ones who migrated to the highlands (Kelabit), causing their culture and language to slightly diverged.

[[File:Sarawak; four Trusan Murut tribesmen.jpg|thumb|Four Lun Bawang tribesman from [[Sarawak]], previously called [[Punang Terusan|Trusan]] Muruts, photos taken by ethnologist [[Charles Hose]] in 1896.]]

Another theory, on the other hand, suggests that the migration originated from the opposite side of Borneo (now [[East Kalimantan]]). It was suggested that the Apo Duat people were once farmers in the lowlands downstream of [[North Kalimantan|Malinau]] river, living closely with the [[Tidong]] people. However, attacks by Muslim raiders ([[Bugis]] and [[Tausūg people|Tausug]]) probably in the 17th century, caused them to migrate to the Krayan highlands, whilst the Tidong people converted to Islam.&lt;ref name = "Eghenter et al"&gt;

Nevertheless, these theories have yet to be proven and there are no substantial evidence to trace the origin of the Lun Bawang people or to prove any of these theories.

==History==
[[File:Lun Bawang speakers distribution.png|thumb|right|Geographical distribution of Lun Bawang speakers.]]
===Relations with the Kingdom of Brunei===
According to Brunei oral tradition, the Lun Bawangs (Murut) were brought under the rule of the Brunei kingdom by peaceful measures during the reign of [[Muhammad Shah of Brunei|Awang Alak Betatar]]. This is said to be accomplished through dealings between the Lun Bawang and Awang Alak Betatar's brother, Awang Jerambok.&lt;ref name = "Hose and McDougall"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Under the rule of the Brunei kingdom, the Lun Bawang were subject to taxes and tribute. The local leaders from the higher class (''lun mebala'' or ''lun do''') were appointed titles of nobility and were granted office in the sultanate. Some Lun Bawang were assimilated into Malay culture.&lt;ref name = "Keat Gin Ooi"&gt;

Nevertheless, the peace dealing between the Lun Bawang and the Brunei Malay rulers was by no means everlasting as throughout the history of Brunei sultanate, the Lun Bawang had often rebelled against its Brunei ruler. It has been suggested that the insurrection of the Maruts (''sic'') - i.e. the Lun Bawangs - and Chinese had led to the Brunei Sultan requesting assistance from the Sulu sultanate to suppress the rebellion in 1658, which resulted in the Brunei Sultan ceding his territory of [[Kimanis]] until Tapean Durian to the [[Sultanate of Sulu|Sultan of Sulu]] as a sign of gratitude.&lt;ref name = "J Hunt Esq 2"&gt;

=== Lun Bawangs with Europeans settlement ===

Early Europeans uses the exonym ''Maroot'', ''Marut'', '' Morut'' or ''Murut'' to describe the Lun Bawang people, and this might have been introduced by the Brunei Malays who came in contact with them in Brunei. The earliest European written account of the Lun Bawang people is probably by [[Thomas Forrest (navigator)|Thomas Forrest]] during his voyage to New Guinea, the Moluccas and Balambangan in 1776. He described that the Borneans (''sic'' - i.e. Bruneians -) tended to preclude the Chinese or European from directly dealing with the Maroot in trade, reserving the trade (as middlemen) to themselves.&lt;ref name = "Thomas Forrest"&gt;

In John Hunt's ''Sketch of Borneo or Pulo Kalamantan'' in 1812, he described the Lun Bawangs as aborigines of [[Brunei|Borneo proper]], and that they are much fairer and better featured than the Malays, having more strong and robust frame and are credited as a brave race of people.&lt;ref name = "J Hunt Esq"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Europeans have also obtained the description of the Lun Bawang from Brunei Malays who came in contact with them. For example, during the voyage of the American ''[[Himmaleh (ship)|Himmaleh]]'' to Brunei, Brunei noblemen (''pangeran'') reported that there are 21 tribes in Brunei - Murut being one of them - and that these tribes are ''kafir'' (do not practice Islam) and practices [[headhunting]].&lt;ref name = "J T Dickenson"&gt;

A more elaborate European account of the Lun Bawang people is by [[Spenser St. John]] in 1860, where he described the impoverished condition of the Lun Bawang (then called Limbang Muruts) people under the rule of the Brunei Sultanate.

&lt;/ref&gt; The production of rice is related to ones' prestige/financial status, as excess of rice harvest are traditionally consumed in huge ''irau'' feast, signifying wealth and fortune. Cooked rice is wrapped inside banana leaves called ''Luba' Laya'', and rice is also brewed into rice wine or ''burak'' for practical reasons. Partly due to this, drinking ''burak'' had been an important (and also notorious, as is deemed by the Christian missionaries and the Brooke government) custom of the Lun Bawangs, but now the rice wine production has significantly dwindled due to effort done by the Christian missionaries and Brooke government to encourage [[prohibition|prohibition of alcohol]] amongst the community in the early 20th century.

Meat and fish are brined or pickled using salt and is stored in hollow bamboo stalk for a duration of a month and the pickled food is called ''telu' ''. Meat and fish are also preserved by smoking. Salt is obtained by evaporating brine from salt spring (''lubang mein'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://travel.kompas.com/read/2015/08/22/103900227/Ketika.Luba.Laya.Lontongnya.Suku.Dayak.Lundayeh.Bertemu.Soto |title=Ketika Luba Laya, Lontongnya Suku Dayak Lundayeh Bertemu Soto |author=Sukoco Nunukan |editor=I Made Asdhiana |publisher=Kompas |date=22 August 2015 |accessdate=2016-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cattles and buffaloes are bred for their meat, and can serve as a symbol of financial status. These animals are commonly used as [[dowry]] that are presented to the bride's family from the groom's side.

In the old days, the men wear jackets made of tree barks called ''kuyu talun''. Cloth wrapped around the forehead is called ''sigar'' and loin cloth is called ''abpar''. A long [[machete]] (''pelepet'') is tied to the waist, especially when it needs to be carried to tribal wars. As for the women, they wear ''pata'' on their head, ''beret'' on their waist, ''bane'' around the neck and ''gileng'' or ''pakel'' is worn as ornaments on their hands and wrists.

The Lun Bawang belong to a group termed as Nulang Arc group (Metcalf 1975). These ethnic (along with other ethnics such as the Berawans, the [[Melanaus]] and the Kajangs) traditionally practised an ancient tradition of secondary treatment of the dead. In Lun Bawang, this is called ''mitang butung''.

Being a predominantly Christian community, Lun Bawang also since the 1950s traditionally celebrates "Irau Rayeh", which is an [[Easter]] festival and celebration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kaltim.tribunnews.com/2015/11/04/bupati-wabup-sibuk-pembagian-sk-tenaga-honor-ditunda |title=Bupati-Wabup Sibuk, Pembagian SK Tenaga Honor Ditunda |publisher=Tribun Kaltim |date=4 November 2015 |accessdate=2016-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
Lun Bawangs were mostly animist before the 1920s. Under the rule of the [[White Rajahs]] ([[Vyner Brooke]]) in Sarawak, Christian missionaries (particularly of the Borneo Evangelical Mission) had better accessibility to the Lun Bawang settlements in the interior and highlands, and proceeded to preach Christianity to the Lun Bawang people.&lt;ref name = "Jim Huat Tan"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The Lun Bawang tribe were often a victim of political manipulation by the Sultanate of Brunei, for example they were used as sacrifice for the marauding Kayan people who threaten to attack the Brunei capital in the 1860s. The low standard of living had led to severe outbreak of diseases (cholera and smallpox) amongst the community, and the population significantly dwindled to the point of near extinction in the 1920s.&lt;ref name = "A Morrison" /&gt;

With the advent of Rajah rule and conversion to Christianity, the standard of living improved tremendously, as the missionaries introduced better healthcare, sanitary system and also proper education system. The Lun Bawang were very zealous at school, and in 1940, about 95% of the Lun Bawang and related Kelabit tribe under 20s in Lawas Damit are literate.&lt;ref name = Steiner&gt;

The [[Borneo Evangelical Mission]] movement has played a major role in a social and economic development of the Lun Bawang community, especially in educating the people on the importance of education and health, also in maintaining peace between Lun Bawang people and those from other ethnic living nearby. &lt;ref name=Tan&gt;

Whilst many Lun Bawangs attained higher level of education in nearby towns such as [[Lawas]], [[Limbang]] and [[Miri, Malaysia|Miri]], and in Sabah, [[Sipitang]] and [[Beaufort, Malaysia|Beaufort]]; and subsequently furthering their studies in the state capitals or in Peninsular Malaysia, there are still relatively little development of schools in Lun Bawang settlement in the interior, such as [[Long Pasia]] or [[Ba' Kelalan]]. Therefore, many Lun Bawang youth in the interior travel a distance from their home in order to pursue education, sometimes via river transport or gravel road.

Job intake in some of the main industries in Sabah and Sarawak, such as oil and gas and palm oil industry remains relatively small, and some are still involved in subsistence farming and fishing. However with continued efforts, many of them managed to become professionals. A 2011 statistics has shown that there are around 233 graduates amongst the Lun Bawang community in Sarawak.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogtau.com/educational-statistic-of-the-lun-bawang-october-2011/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BattleofSluys.jpeg|thumb|Melee aboard ships at the [[Battle of Sluys]] 1340 (BNF Fr. 2643, 15th century)]]
[[File:Battle of Lutzen.jpg|thumb|''[[Battle of Lutzen (1632)|Battle of Lützen]]'' by  [[Carl Wahlbom]] depicting a melee in which King [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden]] was killed on 16 November 1632.]]
'''Melee''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|eɪ|l|eɪ}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɛ|l|eɪ}}, French: '''mêlée''' {{IPA-fr|mɛle|}}) or '''pell-mell''' battle  generally refers to disorganized [[close combat]] in battles fought at abnormally close range with little central control once it starts.{{sfn|OED|2015}}

In the 1579 translation of [[Plutarch]]'s ''Lives of the noble Grecians and Romanes'', [[Sir Thomas North]] uses the term 'pelmel' to refer to a disorganized retreat.&lt;ref name="phrases"&gt;https://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/pell-mell.html&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase was later used in its current spelling in [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'', 1594:

{{Quote
|text= "March on, ioine brauelie, let vs to it pell mell, If not to heauen then hand in hand to hell."
}}

The phrase comes from the French expression ''pêle-mêle'', a rhyme based on the old French ''mesler'', meaning to mix or mingle. 
&lt;ref name="phrases" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pell-mell&lt;/ref&gt;

The French term ''melee'' was first used in English in c. 1640 (also derived from the old French ''mesler'',&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/melee#English&lt;/ref&gt;  but the Old French stem survives in ''[[:wikt:medley|medley]]'' and ''[[:wikt:meddle|meddle]]'').{{sfn|OED|2015}}

In military aviation, a melee has been described as "[a]n air battle in which several aircraft, both friend and foe, are confusingly intermingled".{{sfn|Kumar|DeRemer|Marshall|2004|p=462}}

[[Lord Nelson]] described his tactics for the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] as inducing a "pell mell battle" focused on engagements between individual ships where the superior morale and skill of the [[Royal Navy]] would prevail.{{sfn|Fremont-Barnes|2005|p=38}}

The [[destroyer]] night action of the second [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]] on 13 November 1942, was so utterly chaotic and the ships were so intermingled that an officer on {{USS|Monssen|DD-436|6}} later likened it to "a barroom brawl after the lights had been shot out".&lt;ref name="guadalcanal441"&gt;Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p. 441.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michael H. Tonry''', an American criminologist, is the McKnight Presidential Professor of Criminal Law and Policy at the [[University of Minnesota Law School]]. He is also the director of the University of Minnesota's Institute on Crime and Public Policy. He has  been a visiting professor of law and criminology at the [[University of Lausanne]] since 2001 and a senior fellow at the Netherlands Institute for the Study of Crime and Law Enforcement at [[Free University Amsterdam]] since 2003.&lt;ref name=umn&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.law.umn.edu/profiles/michael-tonry | title=Michael Tonry | work=University of Minnesota Law School | accessdate=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Tonry received his B.A. in history from the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] in 1966 and his L.L.B. from [[Yale Law School]] in 1970. In 1994, Tonry was a Visiting Fellow at [[All Souls College, Oxford]]. He was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from [[Free University Amsterdam]] in 2010.&lt;ref name="cv"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.law.umn.edu/sites/law.umn.edu/files/tonry.cv-12.1.16.pdf | title=Michael Tonry CV | work=University of Minnesota Law School | accessdate=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Tonry worked at the [[University of Chicago]]'s [[Center for Studies in Criminal Justice]] from 1971 to 1973. From 1973 until joining the faculty of the University of Minnesota in 1990, he was on the faculty of the [[University of Birmingham]] and the [[University of Maryland]], and also spent some of this time in private practice at different law firms, including [[Dechert]].&lt;ref name=cv/&gt; In 1990, he joined the University of Minnesota as the McKnight Presidential Professor of Criminal Law and Policy and the director of their Institute on Crime and Public Policy, positions he has held ever since, except for from 1999 to 2005, when he was a professor of law and public policy and director of the Institute of Criminology at [[Cambridge University]].&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;

==Work==
Tonry has researched various subjects in the field of [[criminal law]], including the increasing incarceration rate in the United States during the late 20th century. He has been described as "a leading authority on crime policy" by ''[[the New York Times]]''{{'}} [[Adam Liptak]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/23/world/americas/23iht-23prison.12253738.html |title=U.S. prison population dwarfs that of other nations |last=Liptak |first=Adam |date=2008-04-23 |work=The New York Times |access-date=2017-12-18 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2005 paper, he and [[David P. Farrington]] argued that if this increase was responsible for the declining crime rate in the United States after 1990, then one must find another explanation for the decline in the crime rate in Canada during the same time, since their incarceration rate remained flat during the same period. They also noted that during this time, Finland's incarceration rate declined, but their crime rate did not subsequently go up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=3488331| title=Punishment and Crime across Space and Time | author=Tonry, Michael | journal=Crime and Justice | year=2005 | volume=33 | pages=1–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/10/the-black-family-in-the-age-of-mass-incarceration/403246/ | title=The Black Family in the Age of Mass Incarceration | work=The Atlantic | date=October 2015 | accessdate=12 February 2016 | author=Coates, Ta-Nehisi}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1995 book ''[[Malign Neglect: Race, Crime and Punishment in America]]'', he acknowledged that racial disparities in the criminal justice system are mainly due to differences in criminal activity among races, but also found that the proportion of people arrested for murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault who were black had remained constant at about 45% since the mid-1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/05/us/more-blacks-in-their-20-s-have-trouble-with-the-law.html | title=More Blacks in Their 20s Have Trouble With the Law | work=New York Times | date=5 October 1995 | accessdate=12 February 2016 | author=Butterfield, Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2009 article for ''[[Crime and Justice]]'', he reviewed 200 years of evidence on [[mandatory minimums]] and concluded that they were unsupported by evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-09-30/opinion/ct-oped-1001-prison-20131001_1_prison-population-gun-violence-sentences | title=Mandatory minimum prison sentences will not solve Chicago's epidemic of gun violence | work=Chicago Tribune | date=30 September 2013 | accessdate=12 February 2016 | author=Maki, John}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.salon.com/2015/11/06/what_clinton_and_sanders_both_get_wrong_about_gun_control/ | title=What Clinton and Sanders both get wrong about gun control | work=Salon | date=6 November 2015 | accessdate=12 February 2016 | author=Denvir, Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views==
Tonry wrote in ''The Handbook of Crime and Punishment'', published in 2008, that the United States' prison sentences are far harsher than those of other countries "to which the United States would ordinarily be compared," and that English-speaking countries in general tend to be exceptionally punitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/23/world/americas/23iht-23prison.12253738.html?_r=0 | title=U.S. prison population dwarfs that of other nations | work=New York Times | date=23 April 2008 | accessdate=12 February 2016 | author=Liptak, Adam}}&lt;/ref&gt; He supports non-prison punishments for nonviolent offenders, but has acknowledged that the United States' prison population increasing to almost 2 million people (as of 1998) had reduced crime. That year, he told [[Eric Schlosser]] that "You could choose another two million Americans at random and lock them up, and that would reduce the number of crimes too."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/issues/98dec/pris3.htm | title=The Prison-Industrial Complex | work=The Atlantic | date=December 1998 | accessdate=12 February 2016 | author=Schlosser, Eric}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional and editorial activities==
Tonry has been president of both the [[American Society of Criminology|American]] and [[European Society of Criminology|European]] Societies of Criminology. Since 1977, he has been the editor of ''[[Crime and Justice]]''.&lt;ref name=umn/&gt;

The '''Otomi''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|oʊ|t|ə|ˈ|m|iː}}; {{lang-es|Otomí}} {{IPA-es|otoˈmi|}}) are an [[indigenous people of Mexico]] inhabiting the central [[Mexican Plateau]] (Altiplano) region.

== Overview ==
The two most populous groups are:
* Highland (or Sierra) Otomí, living in the mountains of [[La Huasteca]]. They usually self-identify as ''Ñuhu'' or ''Ñuhmu'', depending on the dialect they speak.
* Mezquital Otomí, living in the [[Mezquital Valley]] in the eastern part of the state of Hidalgo, and in the state of [[Querétaro]]. They self-identify as '''Hñähñu''' ({{IPA-oax|ʰɲɑ̃ʰɲũ|}}).&lt;ref&gt;See Wright Carr (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:OtomiEmbroideryTequis.jpg|thumb|left|Otomi woman selling traditional Otomi embroidered cloths in [[Tequisquiapan]]]]

Smaller Otomi populations exist in the states of [[Puebla]], [[Mexico (state)|Mexico]], [[Tlaxcala]], [[Michoacán]] and [[Guanajuato]].&lt;ref&gt;Lastra (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Otomi language]] belonging to the Oto-Pamean branch of the [[Oto-Manguean languages|Oto-Manguean language family]] is spoken in many different varieties, some of which are not [[mutually intelligible]].

One of the early complex cultures of [[Mesoamerica]], the Otomi were likely the original inhabitants of the central Mexican Altiplano before the arrival of [[Nahuatl]] speakers around {{circa|1000}} CE, who replaced and marginalized them however the Otomi and their nomadic lifestyle allowed them to easily adapt to different environments avoid enemies and defend traditional lands and villages. In the early colonial [[New Spain]] period, Yųhmų Otomi of Tlaxcala helped the Spanish [[conquistador]]s as mercenaries and allies, allowing them to extend into territories such as Querétaro and Guanajuato, previously inhabited by semi-nomadic [[Chichimec]]s.

The Otomi traditionally worshipped the moon as their highest deity. Even in modern times, many Otomi populations practice shamanism and hold prehispanic beliefs such as [[Nagualism]]. Like most sedentary Mesoamerican peoples, Otomis traditionally subsisted on maize, beans and squash, but the [[Agave americana|maguey]] (century plant) was also an important [[cultigen]] used for production of alcohol ([[pulque]]) and fiber ([[henequen]]). Although the Otomi Indians rarely eat what Westerners would consider a balanced diet, they maintain reasonably good health by eating tortillas, drinking pulque, and eating most fruits available around them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Richmond K.|last2=Calvo|first2=Jose|last3=Serrano|first3=Gloria|last4=Payne|first4=George C.|title=A Study of the Nutritional Status and Food Habits of Otomi Indians in the Mezquital Valley of Mexico|url=http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdf/10.2105/AJPH.36.8.883|journal=American Journal of Public Health and the Nations Health|volume=36|issue=8|pages=883–903|doi=10.2105/ajph.36.8.883|pmc=1625980}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943 to 1944, a report about a nutritional study about the Otomi villages located in the Mezquital Valley of Mexico, recorded that despite the arid climate and land unfit for agriculture without irrigation, the Otomi people chiefly depended on the production of maguey. Maguey (century plant) is used to produce weaving fibers and “pulque”, a fermented unfiltered juice that played an important part in the Otomi’s economy and nutrition. However, this practice has begun to decline due to its new large-scale production. The maguey plant was so heavily depended on that huts were constructed out of the plant's leaves. During this time, most of the region was vastly underdeveloped and most agriculture was low-yielding. At times, settlement areas would be confused as locations remote of habitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Richmond K.|last2=Calvo|first2=Jose|last3=Serrano|first3=Gloria|last4=Payne|first4=George C.|title=A Study of the Nutritional Status and Food Habits of Otomi Indians in the Mezquital Valley of Mexico|url=http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdf/10.2105/AJPH.36.8.883|journal=American Journal of Public Health and the Nations Health|volume=36|issue=8|pages=883–903|doi=10.2105/ajph.36.8.883|pmc=1625980}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Otomi were blacksmiths and traded valuable metal items with other indigenous confederations, including the [[Aztec Triple Alliance]]. Their metal crafts included ornaments and weaponry, although metal weaponry was not as useful as [[obsidian]] weaponry (obsidian being sharper than a modern-day razor, abundant, and light in weight).

== History ==
Some historians believe that the Otomi were the first inhabitants of the Valley of Mexico, nevertheless they were later expelled from the valley by the [[Tepanec]] in 1418.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zillges|first=Haleigh|date=2013|title=The Genetic History Of The Otomi In The Central Mexican Valley|url=https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1044&amp;context=anthro_seniortheses|journal=University of Pennsylvania Scholarly Commons|pages=7-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Otomi were one of various ethnic groups present within the city of [[Teotihuacan|Teotihuacán]]; one of the largest and most important cites of ancient Mexico. Around the year 1100 AD, Otomi-speaking peoples formed their capital city-state, [[Xaltocan]]. Xaltocan soon acquired power--enough power to demand tribute from nearby communities up until its subjugation. Thereafter, the Otomi kingdom was conquered during the 14th century by the Mexica and its alliances. The Otomi people then were subject to pay a tribute to the Triple-Alliance as their empire grew; subsequently, Otomi people resettled in lands to the east and south of their former territory. While some Otomi resettled elsewhere, other Otomi still resided near current-day Mexico City, but most settled in areas near the [[Mezquital Valley]] in [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]], the highlands of [[Puebla]], areas between Tetzcoco and [[Tulancingo]], and as far as [[Colima]] and [[Jalisco]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oScUXmAkRXIC&amp;lpg=PA142&amp;dq=otomi%20people&amp;lr&amp;pg=PA143#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Can Threatened Languages be Saved?: Reversing Language Shift, Revisited : a 21st Century Perspective|last=Fishman|first=Joshua A.|date=2001-01-01|publisher=Multilingual Matters|isbn=9781853594922|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

A sizable portion of the Otomi resided in the state of [[Tlaxcala]], where they eventually joined forces with Spanish Conquistador [[Hernán Cortés|Hernan Cortes]], who fought the Aztec Triple-Alliance, and eventually defeated them. This allowed the ixtenco Otomi or (Yųhmų) to once again expand. They founded the City of [[Querétaro City|Querétaro]] and settled in many towns in the state now known as [[Guanajuato]].  The Hñähñu Otomi of Mezquital maintained a state of war upon the spanish and their ixtenco otomi allies with records indicating that the hñähñu resisted assimilation and maintained nomadic raiding parties that attacked any Spanish settlement within hidalgo maintaining a state of war that lasted until the first silver mines were opened The ixtenco otomi allegiance with the Spanish led to many converting to [[Roman Catholic|Roman Catholicism]], but they also held onto their ancient customs. While being colonized, the ixtenco Otomi language was dispersed to various other states such as Guanajuato, Querétaro,that included the states of Puebla, Veracruz, with Michoacán and Tlaxcala, where most remained farmers. In the Mezquital Valley a traditional homeland to the Otomi , the terrain was so not well equipped for farming as the land was dry, so many Otomi people hired each other as laborers and relied heavily on the maguey-based drink, pulque. Originally, the Spanish banned the drink but soon attempted to manage a business through its production which led to the Otomi people solely using the drink for their own consumption. During Mexico’s War of Independence, the Otomi sided with the rebellion as they wanted their land back that was taken from them under the [[encomienda]] system.

Around 1940-50, government agencies had promised to assist the indigenous people by helping them gain access to better education and economic advancements but failed to do so. In turn, the people continued to farm and work as laborers within their minor subsistence economy within a larger capitalistic economy where the indigenous people was able to be exploited by those who are in control of the economy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Since gaining independence, the Mexican government has adopted an adoring attitude towards the pre-Hispanic history and works of the Aztecs and Mayans; meanwhile, it has disregarded the living indigenous people, such as the Otomi who are depicted without the same prestige.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dow|first=James W.|title=The Sierra Ñähñu (Otomí)|url=https://www.academia.edu/1987786/The_Sierra_%C3%91%C3%A4h%C3%B1u_Otom%C3%AD_|journal=Native Peoples of the Gulf Coast of Mexico|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until recently, the Otomi culture and people were not given much attention or focus until recent anthropologist began investigating their ancient way of life. As a result, the Mexican government has gone as far declaring themselves a pluricultural nation that serves to help many of its indigenous populations, like the Otomi. However, this has not been the case with scarce evidence proving that anything is done to truly help them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although many of the current descendants of the Otomi have begun to immigrate to other region, there is still a hint of their ancient culture present today. In certain parts of Mexico, such as Guanajuato and Hidalgo, prayer songs in Otomi are heard and elders share tales the youth who understand their native language. Despite this, very little attention has been placed on the Otomi culture, especially through education means where very little is discussed about any indigenous groups. Because of this, many Otomi descendants know very little about their own cultures history.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Etymology==
The name Otomi is an [[exonym]] and comes from the [[Nahuatl]] ''otomitl'', which is possibly derived from an older word ''totomitl'' "shooter of birds".&lt;ref name="lastra5658"&gt;Lastra, ''Los Otomies'', pp. 56–58.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Otomi refer to themselves as ''Hñähñú'', ''Hñähño'', ''Hñotho'', ''Hñähü'', ''Hñätho'', ''Yųhų'', ''Yųhmų'', ''Ñųhų'', ''Ñǫthǫ'' or ''Ñañhų'', depending on which dialect of Otomi they speak.&lt;ref name="lastra5658"/&gt;&lt;ref name=wa&gt;Wright Carr, "Precisiones sobre el término 'otomí{{'-}}".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=cn&gt;See the individual articles for the terms in each dialect.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the variant forms have two [[morpheme]]s, meaning "speak" and "well" respectively.&lt;ref name="Hekking436"&gt;Hekking &amp; Bakker, "The Case of Otomí", p. 436.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''Otomi'' entered Spanish through Nahuatl and is used to describe the larger Otomi [[Ethnicity#Ethnicity and race|macroethnic]] group and the [[dialect continuum]]. From Spanish, the word ''Otomi'' has become entrenched in linguistic and anthropological literature. Among linguists, the suggestion has been made to change the academic designation from ''Otomi'' to ''Hñähñú'', the [[endonym]] used by the Otomi of the [[Mezquital Valley]], but no common endonym exists for all dialects of the language.&lt;ref name="lastra5658"/&gt;&lt;ref name=wa /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Palancar, "Emergence of Active/Stative alignment in Otomi", p. 357.&lt;/ref&gt;

Otomi is in the [[Oto-Pamean languages]] family (which also includes Chichimeca Jonaz, Mazahua, Pame, Ocuilteco, and Matlatzinca). The family in turn belongs to the [[Oto-Manguean languages]] (with Amuzgoan, Chinantecan, Mixtecan, Otopamean, Popolocan, Tlapanecan, and [[Zapotec language]] families).

[[File:Chris Patten.jpg|thumb|right|[[Chris Patten|Lord Patten]], robed as [[Chancellor of Oxford University]], assisted by a page]]

A '''page''' or '''page boy''' is traditionally a young male attendant or [[domestic worker|servant]], but may also have been used for a [[Courier|messenger]] at the [[wikt:page#Verb 2|service]] of a nobleman.  The origin of the term is uncertain, but it may come either from the Latin ''pagus'' (servant), possibly linked to [[peasant]], or an earlier Greek word {{lang|grc|[[wikt:παῖς|παῖς]]}} (''pais'' = child). During wedding ceremonies, a [[Page boy (wedding_attendant)|page boy]] is often used as a symbolic attendant to carry the rings, a role comparable to the scattering of flower petals by [[flower girl]]s.

==The medieval page==
[[File:Le Caravage - Portrait d'Alof de Wignacourt.jpg|thumb|[[Portrait of Alof de Wignacourt and his Page|Alof de Wignacourt and a page]], by [[Caravaggio]]. [[Louvre]], [[Paris]].]]
In [[Middle Ages|medieval times]], a  page was an attendant to a nobleman, a [[knight]], a Governor or a [[Castellan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Luke|first=Harry|date=1949|title=Malta: An Account and an Apreciation|url=https://books.google.com.mt/books?id=k_5AAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Castellania+Baroque+Valletta&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Castellania+|publisher=Harrap|oclc=|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the age of about seven, sons of noble families would receive training in manners and basic literacy from their mothers or other female relatives. Upon reaching seven years of age, a boy would be sent to the castle, [[great house]] or other estate of another noble family. This would match the age at which apprenticeships or servants' employment would be entered into by young males from lower social classes.

A young boy served as a page for about seven years, running messages, serving, cleaning clothing and weapons, and learning the basics of combat. He might be required to arm or dress the lord to whom he had been sent by his own family. Personal service of this nature was not considered as demeaning, in the context of shared noble status by page and lord. It was seen rather as a form of education in return for labour. While a page did not receive reimbursement other than clothing, accommodation and food, he could be rewarded for an exceptional act of service. In return for his work, the page would receive training in horse-riding, hunting, hawking and combat – the essential skills required of adult men of his rank in medieval society. Less physical training included schooling in the playing of musical instruments, the composition and singing of songs, and the learning of board games such as chess. The initial education received as a child in reading and writing, would be continued to a level of modest competence under the tuition of a chaplain or other cleric,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Barbara W.|last=Tuchman|page=52 &amp; 62|title=A Distant Mirror - the Calamitous 14th Century|ISBN=0-14-005407-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and possibly from a [[grammar]] master. They also learned courtly manners and, in attending to the needs of their master, a degree of temporary humility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chambers|first=David|title=The English House|year=1985|publisher=Guild Publishing|location=London|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Medieval pages might accompany their lords to war. While their roles in battle were generally limited to secondary assistance and minor support functions, pages might expect to participate directly in siege situations. This could occur when a castle was under attack and [[crossbows]] were available for use by pages among the defenders. The mechanical and long-range nature of these devices made them almost the only medieval weapon which could be employed effectively by a youth.&lt;ref&gt;Page 27 ''BBC History Magazine'' July 2017&lt;/ref&gt; 

At age fourteen, the young noble could graduate to become a [[squire]], and by age 21, perhaps a knight himself. These boys were often the [[kinship|scions]] of other great families who were sent to learn the ways of the manorial system by observation. Their residence in the house served as a goodwill gesture between the two families involved and helped them gain social and political contacts for their adult lives. A reference to this kind of page is found in the [[Christmas carol]] ''[[Good King Wenceslaus]]'': "Hither, page, and stand by me, if thou know'st it, telling..."

This type of page is almost unheard of today outside of [[palace|royal residence]]s, although the functions and status of [[Page (assistance occupation)|legislative page]]s are a clear continuation of the earlier role.

==The household page==
Until the early 20th century, boys of humble background might gain a similar place in a great house. According to the [http://www.butlerschool.com International Butler Academy], these pages were apprentice [[footman|footmen]]. Unlike the [[hall boy]]s, who did heavy work, these pages performed light odd-jobs and stood in attendance wearing [[livery]] when guests were being received.

==The decorative page==
{{See also|Lawn jockey}}

[[File:Dutch, 17th century, Black boy with slave collar, Private Collection.jpg|thumb|Page boy with silver collar, Dutch 17th century]]
During and following the [[Renaissance]], it became fashionable for [[Black people|black]] boys and young men to be decorative pages, placed into fancy costumes and attending fashionable [[lady|ladies]] and lords. This custom lasted for several centuries and the "African page" became a staple accoutrement of [[baroque]] and [[rococo]] style.&lt;ref&gt;''The Slave in European Art: From Renaissance Trophy to Abolitionist Emblem'', ed Elizabeth McGrath and Jean Michel Massing, London (The Warburg Institute) and Turin 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The character is frequently illustrated in literature and film, particularly [[period piece|period]]work: 
*In the [[Grace Kelly]] film, ''To Catch a Thief'', an undercover [[detective]] wears the costume of her "African page" to a [[costume]] [[ball (dance)|ball]]. 
*Valentine Nwanze played an "African page" attending [[James Graham, Marquess of Montrose]] in the film [[Rob Roy (1995 film)|''Rob Roy'']]. 
*"Koko", the fictional manservant of an [[opera]] diva, is cast as her African page in ''A Nut at the Opera'' by [[Maurice Vellekoop]]. 
*Decorative pages feature in a drawing room scene in ''[[Persuasion (1995 film)|Persuasion]]''. 
*In the 2012 historical drama film ''[[A Royal Affair]]'', Christian VII has an African page boy named Moranti.

Similarly, Oriental pages were periodically in fashion, e.g. in [[First French Empire|Napoleonic France]] since [[Napoleon|Bonaparte]]'s [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|conquest]] of [[Egypt Eyalet|Ottoman Egypt]].

==Modern pages==
{{see also|page (assistance occupation)}}

While the traditional pages are rare in the modern private workforce, US television network [[NBC]]'s [[NBC page|page program]] is a notable example of contemporary workplace pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Page Program|url=http://www.nbcunicareers.com/page-program|website=NBC|accessdate=3 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Philosophy Documentation Center''' is a [[non-profit organization|non-profit]] [[publishing|publisher]] and resource center that provides access to scholarly materials in [[applied ethics]], [[classics]], [[philosophy]], [[religious studies]], and related disciplines. It publishes [[academic journal]]s, [[proceedings|conference proceedings]], [[anthologies]], and online research [[database]]s, often in cooperation with [[scholarly association|scholarly]] and [[professional association]]s. It also provides membership management and electronic publishing services, and hosts electronic journals, series, and other publications from several countries.

== History ==
The Philosophy Documentation Center was established in 1966 at [[Bowling Green State University]] in Ohio to manage the publication of specialized reference works in philosophy. It was founded by two members of the university philosophy department, Ramona Cormier and Richard Lineback, who recognized a need to improve access to the growing body of philosophical literature in English and other languages. Its first publication was ''The Philosopher’s Index'', which provided bibliographic listings, indexed by subject and author, of recently published journal articles in philosophy. In 1970 PDC assumed responsibility for the publication of the ''[[Directory of American Philosophers]]'' and the ''[[International Directory of Philosophy and Philosophers]]''.

In 1974, PDC began publishing a series of research bibliographies to provide systematic overviews of the primary and secondary work of major philosophers. That same year PDC published its first journal, ''[[Philosophy Research Archives]]'', in cooperation with the [[American Philosophical Association]] and the [[Canadian Philosophical Association]].&lt;ref&gt;''Philosophy Research Archives'', Microfiche 1, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; This bilingual project was established in microfiche format in an effort to overcome the space limitations of traditional print journals.&lt;ref&gt;"Meeting of the Board of Officers of the American Philosophical Association" in ''Proceedings and Addresses of the American Philosophical Association'', Vol. 48 (1974 - 1975), p.80.&lt;/ref&gt; This concept was developed by representatives of the [[American Council of Learned Societies]], the Humanities Research Council of Canada, PDC, and the American and Canadian philosophical associations.&lt;ref&gt;''Philosophy Research Archives'', "Final Statement of Purpose" (August 22, 1974), quoted in the ''Journal of Philosophical Research'', Special Supplement, 2016, https://dx.doi.org/10.5840/jpr201641Supplement66&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of the earliest experiments with non-traditional formats in journal publishing and is freely available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pdcnet.org/pra |title=''Philosophy Research Archives'' website |accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, PDC published a collection of papers from the First National Workshop-Conference on Teaching Philosophy, its first publishing work in support of a new professional organization.&lt;ref&gt;''Teaching Philosophy Today''. edited by [[Terrell Ward Bynum]] and Sidney Reisberg, in cooperation with the National Information and Resource Center for the Teaching of Philosophy, 1977. [[WorldCat]] Record, OCLC Accession No.3286509. This and subsequent Workshop-Conferences on Teaching Philosophy led to the establishment of the [[American Association of Philosophy Teachers]]. See the editor's introduction to the 2nd edition (2012), pp.v-vi.&lt;/ref&gt; PDC also provided publishing services to independent philosophy publications for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;PDC invoices for 1977, retrieved 21 September 2012. This work began with typesetting for ''[[Idealistic Studies]]'' and ''The Journal of Critical Analysis''.&lt;/ref&gt; PDC's production support for serial publications in print and electronic format has expanded significantly since that time. PDC currently produces over a hundred print and electronic publications in philosophy and neighboring disciplines, and provides online access to complete sets of journals and series in several languages.&lt;ref name=home&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pdcnet.org |title=Philosophy Documentation Center web site|accessdate=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995 the editor and owner of ''The Philosopher’s Index'' retired from Bowling Green State University and ended his long association with PDC.&lt;ref&gt;"Hail &amp; Farewell" in ''Phil Facts'', No.20, Summer 1995, p.1&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1995 he has continued to publish ''Philosopher's Index'' separate from PDC with his own organization ([[Philosopher's Information Center]]).&lt;ref&gt;''The Philosopher's Index'', volume 29, no.3, Fall 1995, p.ii&lt;/ref&gt; PDC continued to develop other publications and services, with a focus on the publishing and membership management needs of professional associations and scholarly societies. The scope of this work increased over time, with notable projects such as the ''Proceedings of the Twentieth [[World Congress of Philosophy]]'' and the major publications of the [[American Philosophical Association]].&lt;ref&gt;In 1999-2000 PDC produced the ''Proceedings and Addresses of the American Philosophical Association'', the ''APA Graduate Guide to Philosophy Programs'', and the ''APA Newsletters''. See "Publication Agreement between the American Philosophical Association and the Philosophy Documentation Center", November 11, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Fields covered by PDC now include [[applied ethics]], [[classics]], [[philosophy]], [[religious studies]], and [[semiotics]]. It manages memberships for twenty organizations,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pdcnet.org/pdc/bvdb.nsf/membershipindex?openform |title=Membership Services, Philosophy Documentation Center web site|accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this work includes secure hosting, digital work flow management, authenticated access to electronic resources, and online conference registration.&lt;ref name=home /&gt;

In 2001 PDC relocated its operations and most of its staff to [[Charlottesville, Virginia]] as a consequence of increasing technical demands of this expanding range of services.&lt;ref&gt;Atkins, Ace. "Deep Thoughts" in ''C-Ville Weekly'', July 24–30, 2001, p.5&lt;/ref&gt;

== Electronic resources ==
In 1979, PDC launched [[dial-up access]] to ''The Philosopher's Index'' database in cooperation with [[DIALOG]]; ''Philosopher's Index'' was made available on CD-ROM in 1990. In 1992, PDC published ''The Logic Works'', an instructional software program for introductory logic courses, in cooperation with [[Rob Brady]]. A number of versions of this DOS-based program were published by PDC for 10 years. PDC also published ''EthicsWorks'', a software package for introductory ethics courses, in cooperation with [[Robert Pielke]]. In 1996, PDC partnered with InteLex Corporation to develop [[POIESIS: Philosophy Online Serials]]. This project made the content of dozens of print journals accessible online in conjunction with print subscriptions. It also allowed for the creation of complete back issue collections of several journals on CD-ROM, including ''[[Business Ethics Quarterly]]'', ''[[Philosophy and Theology|Philosophy &amp; Theology]]'', ''[[Review of Metaphysics|The Review of Metaphysics]]'', and ''[[Teaching Philosophy]]''.

In 2009, PDC launched its eCollection of journals and series from several countries, with onlince access for institutions, single individuals, and membership organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pdcnet.org/ecollection |title=Philosophy Documentation Center - About eCollection |accessdate=2 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; PDC partnered with PORTICO to ensure long term preservation of this collection and also participates in the CLOCKSS digital archive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.portico.org/digital-preservation/news-events/news/general-news/the-philosophy-documentation-center-to-preserve-e-journals-in-portico |title=Portico announces agreement with Philosophy Documentation Center |accessdate=15 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edina.ac.uk/cgi-bin/news.cgi?filename=2013-07-15-six_new_clockss_publishers.txt |title=CLOCKSS Archive announces participation of Philosophy Documentation Center |accessdate=15 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, PDC launched the [[International Directory of Philosophy]], an online database consolidating the content of the ''[[Directory of American Philosophers]]'' and the ''[[International Directory of Philosophy and Philosophers]]''. This database contains information on university philosophy departments and programs, professional societies, research centers, journals, and publishers in approximately 130 countries.

In 2011, PDC launched the [[Philosophy Research Index]], a new indexing database not associated with ''The Philosopher's Index'', the ''International Philosophical Bibliography'', or other resource. The goal of the project was to build complete bibliographic coverage of philosophical literature in several languages and by July 2014 it contained over 1.3 million listings. At that time PDC partnered with the PhilPapers Foundation and Philosophy Research Index was incorporated into the [[PhilPapers]] database.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://philpapers.org/bbs/thread.pl?tId=942 |title= 
PhilPapers to incorporate Philosophy Research Index, PhilPapers web site|accessdate=2 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PDC provides single document access options for non-subscribers for all journals and series on its site, including a free preview of the first page of each document. The implementation allows each publication to choose its own access terms.&lt;ref name=home /&gt; Pre-publication access to forthcoming articles is provided for select titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pdcnet.org/wp/services/onlinefirst/ |title=Online First Pre-publication, Philosophy Documentation Center web site|accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PDC is a member of [[CrossRef]] and integrates [[digital object identifier]]s into all journals it publishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crossref.org/crweblog/2011/08/new_crossref_members_97.html |title=CrossRef Blog |accessdate=15 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; PDC also participates in CrossRef's Cited-By Linking and CrossMark version control services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crossref.org/citedby/index.html |title=CrossRef Cited-by Linking |accessdate=8 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crossref.org/crossmark/AboutParticipatingPubs.htm |title=CrossMark Participants |accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2992">The ban on '''pornography in Denmark''' was lifted in 1967. In 1969, [[Denmark]] became the first country in the world to legalize [[pornography]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iub.edu/~kinsey/ccies/dk.php Denmark in the International Encyclopedia of Sexuality] - "...Denmark was the first country in the world to legitimize written pornography in 1967 (followed by pictorial pornography in 1969).".&lt;/ref&gt;

People in Denmark have free access to pornography. There are a few regulations: for example, pornography must be placed out of the eyesight of children, and it may not be sold to persons under the age of 15. The public TV channel [[Kanal København]] broadcast [[hardcore pornography]] free and uncoded at night, in the early 2000s.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

Prior to 2015 there were no specific restrictions against [[animal pornography]] and such affairs came under [[animal cruelty]] laws. If no harm or pain has been inflicted on the animal, such acts are not illegal. This changed in late April 2015, when Denmark passed a new law, making sex with animals illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flertal for lovændring: Nu bliver sex med dyr ulovligt|url=http://politik.tv2.dk/2015-04-21-flertal-for-lovaendring-nu-bliver-sex-med-dyr-ulovligt|website=TV2 Politik|publisher=TV2|accessdate=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This lack of legislation has allegedly made Denmark a center for the production of animal pornography. This accusation, however, was dismissed as a [[urban legend|myth]] by [[Det Dyreetiske Råd]], a legal council, which in November 2006 published an extensive report on the topic of animal sex.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justitsministeriet.dk/nyt-og-presse/pressemeddelelser/2006/menneskers-seksuelle-omgang-med-dyr Udtalelse om menneskers seksuelle omgang med dyr] Det Dyreetiske Råd&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1980, [[child pornography]] has been illegal in Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;Section 234 of the ''Danish Criminal Code'' (1969), reads whoever 'sells indecent pictures or objects to a person under 16 yrs of age' is to be punished by a fine. Section 235 (1980) has a special provision concerning the reproduction and sale of child pornography, that is, sexually explicit photographs of persons who appear to be under 15 years (the taking of such pictures was always a criminal offence).&lt;/ref&gt; It is illegal to distribute photographic or video pornography of persons under the age of 18, although the [[age of consent]] in Denmark is 15. It is, however, not illegal to possess images or videos of people above 15 ''if such persons have given consent''.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3846">A '''quasi-market''' is a [[public sector]] institutional structure that is designed to reap the supposed [[efficiency (economics)|efficiency]] gains of free markets without losing the [[equity (economics)|equity]] benefits of traditional systems of public administration and financing.

==Example==

A notable example would be the [[National Health Service|NHS]] Internal Market introduced by the [[National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990]]: under this system, the purchase and provision of healthcare in the [[UK]] was split up, with government-funded [[general practitioner|GP]] fundholders "purchasing" healthcare from [[NHS Trust]]s and [[District Health Authority|District Health Authorities]], who competed against one another for the fundholding GPs' custom. There was a marginal rise in the rate of increase in NHS productivity, to set against higher transaction costs, but healthcare remained free at the point of service and financed through taxation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Klein|first1=Rudolf|title=Markets, politicians, and the NHS|journal=British Medical Journal|date=27 November 1999|volume=319|issue=7222|pages=1383–4|doi=10.1136/bmj.319.7222.1383|pmid=10574834|pmc=1117121}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenneth Arrow]]'s famous essay "Uncertainty and the Welfare Economics of Medical Care" outlines the difficulties of applying principles of competition in the medical care industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arrow|first1=Kenneth|title=Uncertainty and the Welfare Economics of Medical Care|journal=American Economic Review|date=December 1963|volume=LIII|issue=5|url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/82/2/PHCBP.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The system was regarded by some as a success: the 1997 [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government did not entirely abolish it on taking office. [[GP Fundholding]] was abolished, but replaced by [[NHS Primary Care Trust|Primary Care Trusts]] as purchasers of healthcare. As Klein says this was "universalising fundholding while repudiating the concept".

In October 2014 a row broke out over whether [[University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust]] should be allowed to turn away patients from outside its immediate catchment area. Chief Executive Dame [[Julie Moore]] said the NHS is neither an effective market nor a managed system.  She argued that her hospital was suffering financially because of its success in attracting patients from outside the City.

== Criticism ==
Critics of quasi-markets argue that they can lead to problems of what's called ''[[cream skimming]]''. 

For example, the introduction of open enrollment in UK secondary schools after 1988 (whereby parents could choose which secondary school to send their child to, rather than being limited to the nearest) led to popular schools being oversubscribed. This allowed these schools to select which pupils they would accept, leading some to discriminate against children from low-income backgrounds or non-traditional family structures (e.g. inviting "both" of a child's parents to an informal meeting with the headteacher so as to determine by stealth whether the child comes from an "appropriate" family). Open enrollment also led popular schools to expand their intake, leading to the growth of very large schools with resulting discipline problems, at the expense of smaller schools and rural schools.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9188">'''Santo Sorge''' (Mussomeli, January 11, 1908 – New York, May, 1972) was a [[Sicily|Sicilian]] [[Sicilian Mafia|Mafioso]] living in the United States. His exact role has never been very clear; he was one of the great 'unknowns' of the Sicilian and [[American Mafia]]. He was one of the highest-level Sicilian Mafia leaders in his time. His counsel was sought in important decisions affecting the American Mafia as well. He traveled extensively between Italy and the United States.&lt;ref name=dalescott203&gt;Dale Scott, ''Deep Politics and the Death of JFK'', p. 203-04&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mafia career==
Sorge was a relative of Sicilian Mafia boss [[Giuseppe Genco Russo]]. His first problems with the judicial authorities go back to 1928 in his hometown [[Mussomeli]] for [[brawling (legal definition)|brawling]] and [[grievous bodily harm]]. The charges were dismissed when the peasant accusing him retracted, offering his apologies for causing trouble. In 1932 he was convicted in [[Paris]] (France) to six months' incarceration and a fine of 1,200 [[French franc]]s for [[forgery]] and using a false passport. A year later he was convicted in [[Ghent]] (Belgium) to five months and 20,000 [[Belgian franc]]s for [[fraud]].&lt;ref name=pantaleone131&gt;Pantaleone, "Mafia e droga", pp. 131-37&lt;/ref&gt;

Other sentences for fraud and [[Non-sufficient funds|bad checks]] followed in [[Palermo]] in 1937 and in [[Turin]] in 1939. In 1948 he was convicted to three years and four months on unclear charges for 'political conspiracy' in [[Florence]] (probably related to espionage&lt;ref name=nyt260668/&gt;). Meanwhile, he moved to the United States.&lt;ref name=pantaleone131/&gt; He became a naturalized US citizen living in [[New York City]],&lt;ref name=nyt030865&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1965/08/03/archives/italy-seizes-10-in-the-mafia-linked-with-gang-in-us-raids-abroad.html Italy Seizes 10 in the Mafia Linked With Gang in US], The New York Times, August 3, 1965&lt;/ref&gt; and maintained a respectable front in America, through directorships in front companies such as Rimrock International Oil Company of New York and the Foreign Economic Research Association.&lt;ref name=dalescott203/&gt;

== Lieutenant of Luciano ==
He was considered to be a lieutenant of [[Lucky Luciano]] in the post-[[World War II]] [[heroin]] business, trafficking heroin produced in France by [[Unione Corse|Corsican gangsters]] to the US. The [[opium]] needed to produce the heroin was cultivated in [[Turkey]] and [[Iran]]. The opium was processed into morphine base, after it was transported across [[Syria]] into [[Lebanon]]. From [[Beirut]], Lebanon, or [[Aleppo]], Syria, the morphine base was shipped to clandestine laboratories in France for conversion into heroin.&lt;ref name=hearing&gt;[https://archive.org/details/investigationofi32unit Investigation of improper activities in the labor or management field], Hearings before the Select Committee on Improper Activities in the Labor or Management Field, Select Committee on Improper Activities in the Labor or Management Field, United States Senate, June 30, July 1, 2, and 3, 1958&lt;/ref&gt;

Sorge, an articulate and well looking man with a good education, was probably in charge of moving the money. Owing to his friendship with Genco Russo, he had the right high political contacts in Italy, even among government members.&lt;ref name=pantaleone131/&gt; He used companies in the US, Sicily and Panama.&lt;ref name=nyt020268/&gt;

Sorge was present at [[Grand Hotel des Palmes Mafia meeting 1957|series of meetings between top American and Sicilian mafiosi]] that took place in [[Palermo]] between October 12–16, 1957, in the Grand Hotel Delle Palme in Palermo. [[Joseph Bonanno]], Lucky Luciano, [[Giovanni Bonventre|John Bonventre]], [[Frank Garofalo]] and [[Carmine Galante]] were among the American Mafiosi present, while among the Sicilian side there were [[Salvatore "Ciaschiteddu" Greco]] and his cousin [[Salvatore "The Engineer" Greco]], [[Giuseppe Genco Russo]], [[Angelo La Barbera]], [[Gaetano Badalamenti]], [[Calcedonio Di Pisa]] and [[Tommaso Buscetta]].&lt;ref name=servadio189&gt;Servadio, ''Mafioso'', p. 189&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sterling83&gt;Sterling, ''Octopus'', p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some, one of the main topics on the agenda was the organization of the heroin trade on an international basis. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] believed it was this meeting that established the [[Bonanno crime family]] in the heroin trade.&lt;ref name=shawcross44&gt;Shawcross &amp; Young, ''Men Of Honour'', pp. 44-45&lt;/ref&gt; Sorge apparently was key to the meeting, which did not start before he arrived in Palermo, although Bonanno, Bonventre and Galante had already spent some days in Sicily. The meeting ended when Sorge left Palermo.&lt;ref name=nyt020268&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1968/01/02/archives/police-in-sicily-say-u-s-mafia-attended-57-parley.html Police in Sicily Say U. S. Mafia Attended '57 Parley], The New York Times, January 2, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

== Indicted ==
In August 1965, Sorge and 16 others associated with the Sicilian and American Mafia were indicted in [[Palermo]] by judge [[Aldo Vigneri]] for criminal conspiracy and narcotics and currency rackets in relation with 1957 meeting.&lt;ref name=nyt030865/&gt; Also indicted were Joe Bonanno, John Bonventre, Carmine Galante, [[Gaspare Magaddino]], [[John Priziola]], [[Raffaele Quasarano]], [[Frank Coppola (mobster)|Frank Coppola]] and [[Joe Adonis]]. Sorge was never arrested although Italy sought his extradition. The case against the accused was dismissed for insufficient evidence in June 1968.&lt;ref name=nyt260668&gt;[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0B1EF63C59147493C4AB178DD85F4C8685F9 Cosa Nostra Men Cleared In Sicily; 7 From U.S. Are Among 17 Acquitted in Rackets Case], The New York Times, June 26, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, Sorge sued the city of New York and two retired senior New York police men, [[John F. Shaney]] and [[Ralph Salerno]] of the [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]]'s special unit on organized crime, in a defamation and libel case asking US$418,000 in damages. Salerno had testified in 1965 before judge Vigneri of the Palermo Criminal Court, that Sorge had close relationships with Luciano, [[Vito Genovese]], Galante and Bonanno.&lt;ref name=nyt181267&gt;[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0D1FFD3F54177B93CAA81789D95F438685F9 City Defends 2 Ex-Policemen Sued Over Testimony on Mafia], The New York Times, December 18, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;

==Top Mafia boss==
According to Sorge the retired officers provided false information, who admitted that they could not prove their allegations with certainty. According to Salerno, Sorge "was interested in Cosa Nostra in general for which he maintains public relations."&lt;ref name=nyt181267/&gt; The libel suit was dismissed in March 1968. Sorge also brought a libel [[Lawsuit|suit]] against [[Parade (magazine)|Parade Publications]] for US$1.16 million on the basis of a magazine article by [[Jack Anderson (columnist)|Jack Anderson]] published on January 21, 1962, which had said that Sorge was listed by [[Harry J. Anslinger|Harry Anslinger]], the former Commissioner of the [[Federal Bureau of Narcotics]], as the number five boss in the top ten bosses of the American underworld.&lt;ref name=nyt181267/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McWilliam, ''The Protectors'', p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

Judge Vigneri had also gone to visit Mafia turncoat [[Joseph Valachi|Joe Valachi]], who told him: "I know Santo Sorge and I know he belongs to the Cosa Nostra. It is my personal knowledge that his function was to go and come from America to Italy and vice-versa, carrying out tasks that I don't know. I was never able to understand to what family he belongs. He was a close friend of all Cosa Nostra bosses."&lt;ref name=nyt181267/&gt; He was very close with [[Carlo Gambino]], the head of the [[Gambino crime family]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name=hearing/&gt;

'''Uru of Ch'imu''' is an extinct language of the [[Uros]], an [[Amerindian]] people. Speakers lived on reed islands in [[Puno Bay]] in western [[Lake Titicaca]] in Peru.

Ch'imu Uru was discovered in 1929 by Lehmann, whose notes are in the Library of the [[Ibero-American Institute]] in Berlin. Torero (1992) claims that Uru of Ch'imu is the most divergent of the three [[Uru–Chipaya languages]].

The '''Vazimba''' (Malagasy {{IPA-mg|vaˈʒimbə̥|}}), according to popular belief, were the first inhabitants of [[Madagascar]].  While beliefs about the physical appearance of the Vazimba reflect regional variation, they are generally described as smaller in stature than the average person, leading some scientists to speculate that they may have been a [[pygmy]] people (and therefore a separate [[ethnic groups of Madagascar|Malagasy ethnic group]]) who migrated from the islands that constitute modern-day Indonesia and settled in Madagascar over the course of the period between 350 BCE&amp;ndash;500 CE. Scientific evidence confirms the first arrival and subsequent increase of human settlers on the island during this period, but the pygmy theory has not been proven.  Stories about the Vazimba form a significant element in the cultural history and collective identity of the [[Malagasy people]], ranging from the historical to the supernatural, inspiring diverse beliefs and practices across the island. They have analogs in some other Autronesian cultures, including the [[Menehune]]s in [[Hawaii]].

==History==

===First settlers of Madagascar===
The facts surrounding the initial settling of Madagascar by oceanic explorers from the region of modern-day [[Indonesia]], including the precise timing and nature of this colonization, remain a subject of ongoing debate and study.  It has been theorized that there may have been successive waves of early settlement in Madagascar.  According to this theory, the waves originated from the same region of southeast [[Asia]], spoke the same language&lt;ref&gt;{{Glottolog|vazi1234|Vazimba}}&lt;/ref&gt; and shared the same culture.  When the second wave arrived, they found the island sparsely populated by descendants of the first wave whose culture and way of life had evolved from relatively primitive roots, reflecting centuries of adaptation to local surroundings in total isolation from outside threats. According to popular belief, the Vazimba did not possess knowledge of [[metallurgy]] or rice farming and used weapons made of clay. After Bantu-speaking settlers from East Africa migrated to the island and brought their culture of [[zebu]] cattle herding with them, the Vazimba were said to have herded their zebu without eating them for meat. If the multi-wave settlement theory is correct, the indigenous (first-wave) population that the more technologically advanced second-wave settlers would have encountered upon arrival in Madagascar would provide the historic basis for stories of the primitive nature of the Vazimba societies they are said to have encountered there.&lt;ref name="Mythe"&gt;[http://www.madatana.com/article-vazimba-mythe-ou-realite.php "Vazimba: Mythe ou Realité?"] Razafimahazo, S. ''Revue de l’Océan Indien.'' Accessed on November 8, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeological research and oral histories have provided some indication of how these early inhabitants of the highlands might have lived.&lt;ref name="Kent"&gt;Kent, Raymond K. ''Early Kingdoms in Madagascar: 1500&amp;ndash;1700.''  Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon their arrival in those ancient tropical highland forests, the Vazimba practiced ''tavy'' (swidden, slash-and-burn agriculture) to clear the land for cultivating bananas, tubers, [[ginger]] and [[Cuisine of Madagascar|other staples]]. They gathered honey, fruits and edible seeds and hunted small game in the forests. As their population increased, villages were established and ruled by chiefs and later kings.  Rulers are believed to have reddened their hair using a local mushroom; the association of the color red with royalty is found in many parts of Madagascar to this day.&lt;ref name="Kent"/&gt;

Oral history classifies the Vazimba according to the parts of the island where they are believed to have settled.&lt;ref name="Madatana"&gt;[http://www.madatana.com/article-origine-confuse-des-vazimba-du-betsiriry.php "Origine Confuse des Vazimba du Betsiriry."] Ravalitera, P. ''Journal Express.''  Accessed on November 11, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''vazimba andrano'' ("Vazimba of the Water") settled along rivers and lakes.  The ''vazimba antety'' ("Vazimba of the Soil") were believed to be the most numerous and were reportedly clustered around the valley of Betsiriry in the central Highlands.  The ''vazimba antsingy'' ("Vazimba of the [[Tsingy]]") lived in the caves around the limestone formations (tsingy) of Bemaraha in western Madagascar and were believed to scavenge fruit and other forest products to live.

===Historic rise and decline===
The first period of Malagasy oral history is known as the Vazimba period (''faha vazimba''), beginning with the initial population of the island by the Vazimba and their establishment of kingdoms &amp;ndash; often ruled by Queens &amp;ndash; in the central Highlands region of Madagascar.&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, M. ''From blessing to violence: History and ideology in the circumcision ritual of the Merina in Madagascar.'' Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; According to some accounts,&lt;ref name="Callet"&gt;Callet, F. ''Tantara ny andriana eto Madagascar.'' Académie Malgache, 1908.&lt;/ref&gt; the first Vazimba sovereign of the central highlands was named [[Andriandravindravina]].  The second period in the oral history of the Highlands begins with the conquest of the Vazimba Highland kingdoms by [[Merina]] sovereigns in what would come to be known as [[Imerina]] in their honor. [[Andriamanelo]] (1540&amp;ndash;1575) &amp;ndash; who was himself half-Vazimba through his antecedents Queen [[Rangita]] and Queen [[Rafohy]] &amp;ndash; is credited (along with his successors, [[Ralambo]] and [[Andrianjaka]]) with successfully forcing the Vazimba out of the Highlands and into the western part of the island.&lt;ref name="Callet"/&gt;

It is commonly believed that the last of the Vazimba were annihilated during the reign of [[Andrianjaka]] (1610&amp;ndash;1630).  However, dismissing the stories of distinctive Vazimba physical appearance, Jean-Pierre Domenichini has theorized that the term ''Vazimba'' may have been more of a statement of cultural than ethnic difference and that many who had been considered Vazimba in this period did not die out, but instead may have simply chosen to become assimilated into the vanquishing Merina culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.madatana.com/article-antehiroka-et-royaute-vazimba.php "Antehiroka et Royauté Vazimba."] Domenichini, J.P. ''Express de Madagascar.'' Accessed on November 5, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  The oral history of many Merina and Betsileo families speaks of intermarriage between Merina and Vazimba ancestors,&lt;ref name="Callet"/&gt; and some Malagasy speculate that the hunter-gatherer [[Mikea]] peoples and the [[Vezo]] fishing tribe, both concentrated along the coastline of western and southern Madagascar, may be descended from Vazimba.

==In the popular imagination==
There are many legends and stories in Malagasy oral history relating to important Vazimba figures.  For instance, oral history tells of a Vazimba woman named Ramboamana and a Vazimba man named Ramboabesofy, known as ''tompon-tany'' (masters of the land) &amp;ndash; the earliest inhabitants of Madagascar, who settled in the region of [[Ankavandra]].  The couple had two sons named Rangoromana and Zafihisoky whom legend credits as the first to bring zebu to the island.&lt;ref name="Madatana"/&gt;
Some Merina trace their genealogy back to a man named Ndrenavoavo or his sister Pelamana who, according to oral history, were the very first non-Vazimba people (i.e. second-wave settlers) to arrive in Madagascar.  They are believed to be buried in a forest near Tsirendresaka.  It is said that their tomb was venerated by all the Vazimba of Betsiriry, and in return, the people of Tsirendresaka observe a ''[[Fady (taboo)|fady]]'' (taboo) that forbids the killing of zebu, in homage to the Vazimba and their tradition of herding cattle without consuming them.

In Madagascar today, popular belief maintains that the Vazimba may not have been human at all, but rather a sort of monster or often malevolent spirit that haunts natural sites such as rivers, boulders or gorges.  Oral history maintains that it was customary among Vazimba to [[Architecture of Madagascar#Earliest burial practices|submerge their dead]] in designated bogs or other waters and these areas are held sacred, sometimes becoming sites of pilgrimage and sacrifice.&lt;ref name="Kent"/&gt; The Vazimba are often envisioned as being smaller than the average person, either quite pale or very dark.  The more monstrous descriptions of Vazimba speak of an unnaturally elongated face with large lips concealing fang-like teeth.  Among the many beliefs related to the Vazimba, it is said they cannot stand to touch any object that has made contact with salt, and it is forbidden to bring garlic or pork into an area believed to contain a Vazimba tomb.

'''Victoria''' ({{IPA-la|wikˈtoː.ri.a|n}}), in [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]], was the [[personification|personified]] goddess of victory.&lt;ref name=Victoria&gt;{{cite web|title=Victoria|url=http://www.talesbeyondbelief.com/roman-gods/victoria.htm|website=talesbeyondbelief.com|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is the [[interpretatio graeca|Roman equivalent]] of the [[Greek mythology|Greek goddess]] [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]], and was associated with [[Bellona (goddess)|Bellona]].  She was adapted from the [[Sabines|Sabine]] agricultural goddess [[Vacuna]] and had a [[temple of Victory|temple]] on the [[Palatine Hill]]. The goddess [[Vica Pota]] was also sometimes identified with Victoria. Victoria is often described as a daughter of [[Pallas (Titan)|Pallas]] and [[Styx (mythology)|Styx]], and as a sister of [[Zelus]], [[Kratos (mythology)|Kratos]], and [[Bia (mythology)|Bia]].&lt;ref name=Nike&gt;{{cite web|title=Nike|url=http://www.theoi.com/Daimon/Nike.html|website=theoi.com|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the Greek ''[[Nike (mythology)|Nike]]'', the goddess Victoria ([[Latin]] for "victory") was a major part of Roman society.  Multiple temples were erected in her honor. When her statue was removed in 382 CE by Emperor [[Gratianus]] there was much anger in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Sheridan, J. J., "The Altar of Victory – Paganism's Last Battle." L'Antiquite Classique 35 (1966): 187.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ambrose Epistles 17–18; Symmachus Relationes 1–3.&lt;/ref&gt; She was normally worshiped by [[Roman triumph|triumphant]] generals returning from war.&lt;ref name=Victoria /&gt;

Also unlike the Greek Nike, who was known for success in athletic games such as [[chariot race]]s, Victoria was a symbol of victory over death and determined who would be successful during war.&lt;ref name=Victoria /&gt;

Victoria appears widely on Roman coins,&lt;ref name="Numisma Club"&gt;{{cite web|title=All About Gold|url=https://www.google.com/search?q=winged+victoria+coin&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=985&amp;tbm=isch&amp;imgil=4xywygaZzd6ZkM%253A%253BFBNoDvHOnrgSaM%253Bhttp%25253A%25252F%25252Fnumismaclub.com%25252Funt%25252F112109-1985_silver_coin_1_troy_oz_mexico_libertad___999_fine_winged_victoria_eagle_snake.html&amp;source=iu&amp;pf=m&amp;fir=4xywygaZzd6ZkM%253A%252CFBNoDvHOnrgSaM%252C_&amp;usg=__MO17Rf96Yqnqs4o5Cnx72MRXE2I%3D&amp;ved=0CCsQyjdqFQoTCOS9wc6okccCFcGMDQodGyMGrg&amp;ei=gq3BVeT0LcGZNpvGmPAK#imgrc=4xywygaZzd6ZkM%3A&amp;usg=__MO17Rf96Yqnqs4o5Cnx72MRXE2I%3D|website=numismaclub.com|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; jewelry, architecture, and other arts. She is often seen with or in a [[chariot]], as in the late 18th-century sculpture representing Victory in a [[quadriga]] on the [[Brandenburg Gate]] in [[Berlin]], Germany; "[[Il&amp;nbsp;Vittoriano]]" in Rome has two. Nike or Victoria was the charioteer for [[Zeus]] in his battle to over take Mount Olympus.

==Iconography==
Winged figures, very often in pairs, representing victory and referred to as "victories", were common in Roman official iconography, typically hovering high in a composition, and often filling spaces in [[spandrel]]s or other gaps in architecture.&lt;ref name=Spandrels&gt;{{cite web|title=Winged Victoria Spandrels|url=https://www.google.com/search?q=victoria+spandrels&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=985&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCwQsARqFQoTCIy4s6apkccCFYyZgAodF0sApA#tbm=isch&amp;q=winged+victoria+spandrel|website=google.com|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These represent the spirit of victory rather than the goddess herself.  They continued to appear after Christianization of the Empire, and slowly mutated into Christian [[angel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title='Declaring Victory, Concealing Defeat: Continuity and Change in Imperial Coinage of the Roman West, c. 383 – c. 408', in G.

      <comment>I changed the definition on a wheat pool from "buying grain from farmers" to "marketing grain on behalf of its farmer-members" because I believe that to be true - that that is what a wheat pool is.

[[File:Alberta Grain Company Grain Elevator.JPG|thumb|300px|Old wheat pool grain elevator in Alberta, Canada]]
A '''wheat pool''' is a [[co-operative]] that markets grain (mostly wheat) on behalf of its farmer-members. 

In Canada in 1923 and 24, three wheat pools were created. They were [[agricultural cooperative|farmer-owned co-operatives]], created to break the power of the large [[for-profit]] corporations, that had dominated the [[grain trade]] in Western Canada since the late 19th Century, and were an early source of [[Western alienation]].

The wheat pools were successful grain traders and marketers from 1923 to 1929. During the [[Great Depression]], however, huge losses forced them out of the grain marketing business. They persisted as [[grain elevator]] operators but after 1935 all grain marketing in Canada shifted to a new government agency, [[Canadian Wheat Board]].

During the post-war era, the wheat pools almost completely replaced the private grain companies as elevator operators. By the 1990s, however, most had [[Demutualization|demutualized]] (privatized), and several mergers occurred. Now all the former wheat pools are part of the [[Viterra]] corporation, which itself was acquired by [[Glencore Xstrata]] in 2013.

== Background ==
=== Agrarian activism ===
The pools were the culmination of a long tradition of agrarian activism dating back decades in the [[Prairie Provinces]] of Canada which peaked in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Rennie, Bradford James, ''The Rise of Agrarian Democracy: The United Farmers and Farm Women of Alberta'', 1909–1921, (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2000), 222&lt;/ref&gt; One notable date was the founding of the [[Territorial Grain Growers Association]] (T.G.G.A.) in 1901. The T.G.G.A.'s successor organizations would be important organizers in the later campaigning to organize the wheat pools. The co-operative movement was also being established in Canada at this time.

=== Farmer grievances ===
At this time farmers in the [[Prairie Provinces]] were deeply [[social alienation|alienated]] from the [[National Policy|Canadian political and economic status quo]]. Farmers accepted as common knowledge that grain companies, [[railway of Canada|railways]], [[banks of Canada|banks]], and [[government of Canada|the government]] were part of a system that sought to exploit and oppress farmers. They developed a [[class solidarity]] and a fear and loathing of the [[ruling elite]].&lt;ref&gt;Rennie, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically they despised the private [[grain trade]] system as symbolized by [[Winnipeg Grain Exchange]]. Farmers suspected the grain traders of being [[Reseller|middle men]] who only profited by [[Parasitism (social offense)|leeching]] off the efforts of farmers without [[Value added|adding any value]]. They were especially angered by the practice of [[hedge (finance)|hedging]] that private traders used on the [[futures exchange]], which they believed allowed traders to profit from falling markets, hurting farmers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Grant MacEwan]], ''Harvest of Bread'', (Saskatoon: Prairie Books, 1969), 99; Allan Levine, "Open Market or 'Orderly Marketing':The Winnipeg Grain Exchange and the Wheat Pools, 1923 1929", ''Agricultural History'', 61, 2 (Spring,1987), 51; Fairbairn, 8–13&lt;/ref&gt; They also believed that private traders artificially held down prices during the fall [[harvest]] in order to shortchange producers.

== Previous attempts to reform the grain trade ==
=== Elevator co-ops ===
Some attempts had been made to set up co-operative grain elevators. There were many local co-ops that owned a single elevator, but the two most important were the [[United Grain Growers]] (U.G.G.) and the Saskatchewan-government backed [[Saskatchewan Co-operative Elevator Company]] (Sask. Co-op Elevators). U.G.G. was formed by merger of two smaller co-ops: the Alberta government-backed [[Alberta Farmers' Co-operative Elevator Company]] and the [[Grain Growers Grain Company]] (G.G.G.C., which had previously acquired the elevators of failed Manitoba government elevator company) in 1917. Following the merger, U.G.G. was a powerful force with 300 elevators and a terminal at the Lakehead.&lt;ref&gt;Rennie, 153.&lt;/ref&gt; While U.G.G. and Sask. Co-op Elevators were farmer-owned, they did not follow the traditional co-op structure of paying dividends back to the users on a patronage basis (per the amount of business), instead they paid dividends to shareholder-investors. For diehard co-operators this was unacceptable. Furthermore, the two companies were unable to negotiate a merger between themselves and were not involved in marketing grain overseas. They lacked the size or reach to challenge the open-market system.&lt;ref&gt;Fairbairn, 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Government marketing ===
During the Great War the Canadian government had completely taken over the grain industry. The government created a series of boards in and around the war, each with progressively more power to control the grain trade. The [[Board of Grain Commissioners]] of 1912 was purely for regulation (to supervise grading, etc.), but by 1915 the government had seized control of all wheat exports to help the war effort, and by 1917 futures trading on the Winnipeg Exchange was banned. In 1917, the new [[Board of Grain Supervisors]] was given monopoly powers over wheat, and fixed uniform prices across the country. Soon after the Board took over marketing of crops as well. Farmers were worried that after the war prices would crash and various agrarian groups lobbied Ottawa to keep the Board in place. The government relented by creating the [[Canadian Wheat Board]] for the 1919 crop only. Farmers got a guaranteed price for that crop, paid immediately, and later a further payment once the Board had sold all harvest and made a profit. This system of guaranteed prices and distributed income was extremely popular and when the Board dissolved in 1920, farmers were livid. It certainly did not help that, "from a peak of $2.85 per bushel in September, 1920 [prices] began a slow and sickening decline to less than a dollar a bushel in late 1923."&lt;ref&gt;MacEwan, Harvest, 103.&lt;/ref&gt; This marked contrasted to the stable prices of 1919–1920 Board seemed to confirm farmer's suspicions of market trading.

*[[Saskatchewan Wheat Pool]] 1924–2007 – renamed [[Viterra]]; in 2012 acquired by [[Glencore]] and Canada assets sold to [[Agrium]]
*[[Manitoba Pool Elevators]] 1926–1998 – merged to form [[Agricore United|Agricore Cooperative Limited]]
*[[Canadian Wheat Board]] was a government agency responsible for exporting wheat. Created in 1935 by the federal government, its future is now threatened by government desire to divest their interest in CWB to form a co-operative.

A former member of the [Forty-Two Gang] in Chicago, Aloisio's arrest record dated back to 1928. In 1945, Aloisio was [[sentence (law)|sentence]]d to five years at [[Leavenworth Penitentiary]], in [[Leavenworth, Kansas]], for helping his brother avoid [[military conscription]], during [[World War II]]. Aloiso had [[bribe]]d [[U.S. Navy]] personnel in Chicago to make sure that his relative failed his physical examination.

'''Yakkha''' (also erroneously spelled as '''Yakha''') is a language spoken in parts of [[Nepal]], [[Darjeeling district]] and [[Sikkim]]. The Yakkha-speaking villages are located to the East of the Arun river, in the southern part of the [[Sankhuwasabha district]] and in the northern part of the [[Dhankuta district]] of Nepal. About 14,000 people still speak the language, out of 17,003 ethnic Yakkha in Nepal.&lt;ref&gt;Toba, Sueyoshi, Ingrid Toba and Novel Kishore Rai (2005): ''Diversity and Endangerment of Languages in Nepal'', UNESCO Kathmandu Series of Monographs and Working Papers: No 7, Kathmandu: United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, Kathmandu Office.&lt;/ref&gt; Genealogically, Yakkha belongs to the Eastern Kiranti languages and is in one subgroup with several [[Limbu]] languages, e.g. [[Belhare language|Belhare]], [[Athpare language|Athpare]], [[Chintang language|Chintang]] and [[Chulung language|Chulung]] . Ethnically however, the [[Yakkha|Yakkha people]] perceive themselves as distinct from the other Kiranti groups such as [[Limbu]]. &lt;ref&gt;Linkha, Magman and Bam Dewan (2005 (VS 2064)): ''Yakkha Ce’ya Sikla – Prarambhik Yakkha

==Geographical distribution==
'''Mugali''' is spoken between Mugakhola and Sinuwakhola on the eastern banks of the [[Arun River, China-Nepal|Arun River]] in [[Dhankuta District]], [[Kosi Zone]], Nepal, in the villages (VDC's) of [[Muga, Nepal|Muga]], [[Pakhribas]], and [[Phalate]].&lt;ref name=e18/&gt;

'''Phangduwali''' is spoken above the Mugakhola headwaters in [[Pakhribas]] VDC, [[Dhankuta District]], [[Kosi Zone]], Nepal.

'''Lumba-Yakkha''' is spoken in [[Arkhaule Jitpur]] and [[Marek Katahare]] VDC's, northern [[Dhankuta District]], [[Kosi Zone]], Nepal.

==Phonology==

===Vowels===
Yakkha has the five vowels {{IPA|[a], [e], [i], [o], [u]}}. There are no centralized vowels as in other Kiranti languages. Variation between short and long vowels is possible, but this is not a phonemic contrast, because no minimal pairs can be found. Diphthongs such as {{IPA|[oi̯], [ui̯], [ai̯]}} can be found in some words such as ''uimalaŋ'' "steep descent", or the interjection ''hoiʔ'' "Enough!".

===Consonants===
The consonants are shown in the table below. The voiced consonants in brackets have doubtful status. They are not phonemes, because no minimal pairs can be established. But they are also not motivated by a phonological rule. Furthermore, the voiced consonants occur only in a few words, and some of them are [[Nepali language|Nepali]] loans. Examples with initial voiced consonants are ''gogoba'' (an insect/worm), ''ghak'' "all", ''jeppa'' "really", ''ɖaŋgak'' "stick".

Notes:
*A typical feature of Eastern Kiranti languages is the merger of voiced and voiceless obstruents, and also Yakkha exhibits this feature. Voicing occurs however optionally between vowels and after nasals. Unaspirated obstruents undergo this voicing rule more regularly than aspirated obstruents. Voiced consonants that are not motivated by  a phonological rule exist, but they are rare.
*Another feature of the Yakkha sound system is the change of proto */r/ and */R/ to /y/, e.g. the word for salt is ''yum'' in Yakkha, but ''rum'' in Puma (Central Kiranti), and ''rɨm'' in Dumi (Western Kiranti).
*The rhotic [r] is not found word-initially, but in [Cr] clusters and in intervocalic position, as in ''makhruna'' "black" and ''tarokma'' "start".
*Several morphophonological processes operate in Yakkha, so that the underlying forms are not easy to establish. Many of these  processes have to do with substitution by a nasal, e.g. in compound verbs like ''suncama'' "itch", the underlying verb stems are /sut/ and /ca/. To take an example from inflection, the verb ''sapthakma'' "like" is inflected ''sapthaŋmecuna'' "they (dual) like him". Other examples of morphophonological processes are the change of underlying ''et-se'' to [esse] (meaning "in order to hunt fish").
*Underspecified [[Nasal consonant|Nasal]] [[prefix]]es assimilate in the place of articulation to the stem-initial consonant, e.g. ''m-baŋ'' "your-house", but ''n-chem'' "your-song".
"aka"my

==Morphology==
Yakkha has rich nominal and verbal morphology. Nouns inflect for case and number. Verbs inflect for person, number (singular, dual, plural/nonsingular), negation, several categories in the domain of tense, aspect and mood. In transitive verbs, both actor and undergoer are coreferenced on the verb. The category of [[Clusivity|inclusive/exclusive]] is found in the verbal morphology and in the possessive pronouns and prefixes.

===Pronouns===
Yakkha pronouns distinguish between singular, dual and plural [[grammatical number|number]], and the possessive pronouns additionally distinguish between the [[Clusivity|inclusion]] and the [[Clusivity|exclusion]] of the addressee. The third person only has singular and nonsingular forms. The possessive pronouns have developed from the personal pronouns and the [[Genitive case|genitive]] marker ''-ka''. The possessive prefixes obviously are [[Grammaticalisation|grammaticalised]] possessive pronouns. They can be used instead of the possessive pronouns, e.g. one could say ''akka paŋ'' or ''a-paŋ'', both meaning "my house". Sounds represented by /N/ in the table are underspecified nasals.

===Interrogatives and indefinite reference===
Yakkha has the following [[interrogative word|interrogative pronouns and other interrogatives]]: ''isa'' "who", ''i/ina'' "what", ''iya'' "what" (if many items or uncountables are asked for), ''hetna'' "which", ''imin'' "how", ''ijaŋ'' "why", ''hetne'' "where", ''hetniŋ'' "when". 
If a certain item is asked for, ''ina'' will be used, but if an event is in question, the root ''i'' occurs without further morphology, e.g. ''i leksa?'' "What happened?". Reduplication of the pronouns may result in indefinite reference, e.g.  ''hetniŋ hetniŋ'' "some time".

===Case system===

Yakkha distinguishes the unmarked [[absolutive case]], the [[Ergative case|ergative]] ''-ŋa'', the [[Genitive case|genitive]] ''-ka/-ga'', the [[Locative case|locative]] ''-pe/-be'', the [[Ablative case|ablative]] case ''-bhaŋ'' and the [[comitative case]] ''-nuŋ'', and the [[Instrumental case|instrumental]] case ''-ŋa''. 
* The absolutive marks subjects of intransitive verbs and objects of transitive verbs. In some verb classes (in the sense of valency classes), objects are marked with a locative or an instrumental. The ergative marks the agents of transitive verbs except for first and second person pronouns, which are in the unmarked nominative. Examples for absolutive and ergative case (overt arguments are often omitted in natural discourse, but the examples contain them to illustrate the case):

:''ka khemeŋna'' "I go"

:''uŋ-'''ŋa''' uŋ tundwana'' "he understands him"

* As in many other [[Kiranti languages]], there is an ergative-instrumental [[Syncretism (linguistics)|syncretism]], as both cases are marked by ''-ŋa''. The instrumental is used to mark instruments in a broad sense, and also for temporal reference:

:''luŋkhwak-'''ŋa''''' "with/by means of a stone" (stone-INS)

:''khiŋ-belaʔ-'''ŋa''''' "thesedays" (this-time-INS)

* The genitive, marked by ''-ka/-ga'' marks the possessed item in possessive constructions, and materials:

:''ak-'''ka''' niŋ'' "my name" (I-GEN (prefix-)name)

:''siŋ-'''ga''' saŋghoŋ'' "wooden stool" (wood-GEN stool)

* The locative marks locations and goals of movement and transfer:

:''khorek-'''pe''' cuwa'' "(There is) beer in a/the bowl." (bowl-LOC beer)

* The comitative marks the accompaniment by someone or something. Also adverbials and adverbial clauses can be built with the comitative.

:''nda-'''nuŋ''' '' "with you"

:''suha-'''nuŋ''' '' "sour" (in adverbial use, e.g. taste sour)

===Verbal morphology===
*The verbal morphology is very complex, which is a typical feature of Kiranti languages. The outline given here necessarily provides a simplified picture. The verbal morphology is predominantly represented by suffixes, but one prefix slot exists, that is filled with an underspecified nasal that codes either third person plural or negation.
*Person and number of both actor and undergoer are indicated on the verb, and these affixes may differ according to the semantic role of their referent. For instance, the suffix ''-ka/-ga'' codes second person ("you"), regardless of the [[Thematic relation|semantic role]], while the suffix ''-m'' codes only (first and second person) agents, and the suffix ''-u'' only codes third person undergoer. There are syncretisms, for instance the already mentioned suffix ''-m'', that stands for both agreement with first and second person plural (agent). Some relations are coded by a [[Portmanteau|portmanteau morpheme]], e.g. the first person acting on the second is coded by '-nen' (i.e. "I understand/call/kiss etc. YOU"), supplemented by number suffixes if necessary. 
*Another feature typical for Kiranti verbal morphology is the copying of nasals into syllable codas in the suffix string of a finite verb. For instance, the negated form of ''tum-me-ŋ-c-u-ŋ-ci-ŋa'' "we (dual, excl) understand them" is ''n-dum-me-'''n'''-c-u-'''n'''-ci-ŋa-'''n'''-na'', where the negation marker ''-n'' is copied several times.
*As for tense, the nonpast is overtly marked by ''-meʔ'' or ''-wa''. Both suffixes have their origin in grammaticalized lexical verbs ("do" and "be/exist" respectively). They occupy different slots in the verbal suffix template. The past is marked by the suffix ''-a'', which is often elided to avoid hiatus in underlying vowel sequences. The perfect tense is built by the addition of the suffixes ''-ma'' or ''-uks'' to the past morpheme, and the past perfect tense is built by further addition of the suffix ''-sa'' to this suffix string.
*As for mood, the imperative is also coded by the suffix ''-a'', e.g. ''ab-a'' "Come!" In transitive verbs with a third person patient, the overt suffix is ''-u'', and the imperative suffix is not overtly realised. The subjunctive mood has no dedicated marker, it is marked precisely by the absence of anything but the agreement morphology, e.g. ''ciya hops-u-m?'' "Shall we have tea?" (tea sip-3P-1A). The subjunctive mood also expresses warnings, suggestions and potential situations in some subordinate clause types.
