{{one source|date=March 2011}}
'''Academic probation''' in the United Kingdom is a period served by a new [[academic staff]] member at a university or college when they are first given their job.&lt;ref name=Hall2003 /&gt;&lt;ref name=FryKetteridgeMarshall2003 /&gt;  It is specified in the conditions of employment of the staff member, and may vary from person to person and from institution to institution.  In universities founded prior to the [[Further and Higher Education Act 1992]], it is usually three years for academic staff and six months to a year for other staff.  In the universities created by that Act, and in colleges of [[higher education]], the period is generally just a year across the board, for both academic and other staff.&lt;ref name=Hall2003 /&gt;

Probation is generally monitored by a '''probationary supervisor''', who meets with the probationer both formally, for formal reviews, and informally over the probation period.  This is not the same role as a mentor, whose task is to provide consultation and advice during the first few months of a staff member's employment.  Typical tasks performed by a mentor, when not performed by people such as a departmental officer nominated for the purpose, are things such as pointing out departmental health and safety information (such as fire drills, for example).  The probationary supervisor, in contrast, follows the organization's formal probation scheme, monitoring the probationer's work; setting out work goals, standards of work, and training needs; and organizing reviews to ensure that standards are met and goals are achieved.&lt;ref name=Hall2003 /&gt;

{{rquote|right|'''Lecturers'''&lt;br/&gt;Probationary period to be three years with possible extension to four years in doubtful cases. Training procedures to be improved with thorough review prior to confirmation on the basis of revised and improved procedures and criteria.|Academic and Related Salaries settlement 1971|''Circular to Deans of School'', University of Dundee&lt;ref name=Dundee2007 /&gt;}}
The extended length of the probationary period in universities prior to the FHE Act 1992 is the result of an agreement made in 1974 between the University Authorities Panel and the [[Association of University Teachers]], the Academic and Related Salaries Settlement.  The working party that formed the agreement stated that the purpose of academic probation was to decide, at the end of the probationary period whether a member of staff should be retained, and that this decision is based upon "the long-term interests of the university itself, of the other members of its staff, and of its students".  The working group set out several criteria that a probationer was expected to satisfy:&lt;ref name=Hall2003 /&gt;
*The probationer must have satisfactorily performed all teaching, tutorial, and supervisory work assigned to him/her.&lt;ref name=Hall2003 /&gt;
*The probationer must have satisfactorily engaged in the research work in his/her subject.&lt;ref name=Hall2003 /&gt;
*The probationer must have properly carried out all examination and administrative duties assigned to him/her.&lt;ref name=Hall2003 /&gt;
*The probationer must have shown promise, through his/her work, of continuing development as teacher and scholar.&lt;ref name=Hall2003 /&gt;
It was decided that in practice, evaluating whether a probationer satisfied such criteria would take at least three years, although it was possible for it to take just one or two in rare, exceptional, cases.  Also stipulated by the agreement was the fact that completion of academic probation at one university should count towards probation at other institutions, and that it was unreasonable to impose second or third probationary periods.&lt;ref name=Hall2003 /&gt;

However, this stipulation does not cover the shorter, one year, probationary period used by universities that came after the FHA Act 1992.  That shorter period resulted from a 1990/1991 agreement between teaching unions and the then polytechnics and colleges that were later to become universities under the Act.  It was modified by various local agreements with individual institutions.  ([[Middlesex University]], for example, has an eight-month academic probation period as a result of a local agreement.)  In such universities, the focus of academic probation is less upon the performance research and other scholarly work, and more upon the performance of teaching work.  The universities can, for example, require several formal observations of a probationer's teaching practices, for assessment and review. (Middlesex University requires two, for example.)&lt;ref name=Hall2003 /&gt;

The '''Acehnese language''' ([[Jawi alphabet|Jawi]]: بهسا اچيه) is a [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian]] language spoken by [[Acehnese people]] natively in [[Aceh]], [[Sumatra]], [[Indonesia]]. This language is also spoken by Acehnese descendants in some parts of [[Malaysia]] like [[Yan, Kedah|Yan]], in [[Kedah]].

== Name ==
As of 1988, "Acehnese" is the modern [[English language|English]] name spelling and the bibliographical standard, and [[Acehnese people]] use the spelling "Acehnese" when writing in English. "Achinese" is an antiquated spelling of the English language tradition. "Atjehnese" is the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] spelling and an outdated [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] one. The spelling "Achehnese" originates from a 1906 English translation of the Dutch language ''Studien over atjesche klank- en schriftleer. Tijdschrift voor Indische Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde 35.346-442'' by [[Christiaan Snouck Hurgronje]], 1892. In Acehnese the language is called ''Basa/Bahsa Acèh''. In Indonesian it is called ''Bahasa Aceh''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Durie|Durie]], "The So-Called Passive of Acehnese," p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classification and related languages ==
Acehnese belongs to the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian branch]] of [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]]. Acehnese's closest relatives are the other [[Chamic languages]], which are principally spoken in [[Vietnam]]. The closest relative of the Chamic family is the [[Malay language]] family, which includes languages also spoken in [[Sumatra]] such as [[Gayo language|Gayo]], the [[Batak languages]] and [[Minangkabau language|Minangkabau]] as well as the national language, [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]].

[[Paul Sidwell]] notes that Acehnese likely has an [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]] substratum.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Sidwell|Sidwell, Paul]]. "[http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf8/sidwell2006dating.pdf Dating the separation of Acehnese and Chamic by etymological analysis of the Aceh-Chamic lexicon]." ([https://www.webcitation.org/6H8pdR68H?url=http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf8/sidwell2006dating.pdf Archive], [http://rilca.mahidol.ac.th/e-resources/documents/05-MonKhmer/36/sidwell2006dating.pdf Alternate], [https://www.webcitation.org/6H8ppf4D2?url=http://rilca.mahidol.ac.th/e-resources/documents/05-MonKhmer/36/sidwell2006dating.pdf Archive])&lt;/ref&gt;

Notes:
*Syllable-final orthographic {{angbr|k}} always represents {{IPA|/ʔ/}} save in certain recent loans
*/f/, /z/, and /ʃ/ are borrowed sounds, and are often replaced by ph,{{what|date=October 2015}} dh,{{what|date=October 2015}} and ch{{what|date=October 2015}} respectively
*The post-stopped nasals (orally released nasals) have been called "funny nasals".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Asyik|1982|p=2}}, citing {{Harvcoltxt|Lawler|1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are distinct from the nasal-stop sequences {{IPA|/mb/, /nd/, /ɲɟ/, /ŋɡ/}}, e.g. in {{IPA|/banᵈa/}} 'port' vs {{IPA|/mandum/}} 'all'.&lt;ref&gt;Long &amp; Maddieson (1993) "Consonantal evidence against Quantal Theory", ''UCLA Working Papers in Phonetics'' 83, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammar==
Acehnese features a [[Split ergativity|split ergative]] system. Intransitives that align with the agent of a transitive verb (Sa) always show agreement by a proclitic (1). Meanwhile, intransitives that align with the patient of a transitive verb (Sp) may optionally show agreement by an enclitic (2). [[Volition (linguistics)|Volitionality]] is the determining factor for whether an intransitive verb is Sa or Sp.&lt;ref&gt;Durie, Mark (1988).

== Writing system ==
Formerly, the Acehnese language was written in an [[Arabic script]] called Jawoë or [[Jawi script|Jawi]] in the Malay language. The script is less common nowadays.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} Since colonization by the Dutch, the Acehnese language has been written in the [[Latin script]], with the addition of supplementary letters. The additional letters are é, è, ë, ö and ô.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bahasaaceh.wordpress.com/2008/11/12/ejaan-bahasa-aceh Ejaan Bahasa Aceh]&lt;/ref&gt; The sound ɨ is represented by 'eu' and the sound ʌ is represented by 'ö', respectively. The letter 'ë' is used exclusively to represent the [[schwa]] sound which forms the second part of diphthongs. The letters f, q, v, x, and z are only used in loanwords.

== Dialects ==
So far there has been no complete research about dialects of the Acehnese language. However, there are at least 10 dialects in the Acehnese language. The dialects are Pasè, Peusangan, Matang, Pidië, Buëng, Banda, Daya,  Meulabôh, Seunagan and Tunong.&lt;ref&gt;Sulaiman, B. 1981. Kedudukan dan Fungsi Bahasa Aceh di Aceh.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27538">'''Alliance Quebec''' (AQ) was a group formed in 1982 to [[Lobbying|lobby]] on behalf of [[English-speaking Quebecers]] in the province of [[Quebec]], Canada. It began as an [[umbrella group]] of many English-speaking organizations and institutions in the province, with approximately 15,000 members.  At its height in the mid-1980s, the group had a network of affiliated anglophone groups throughout the province.  However, a prolonged decline in influence, group cohesion, membership and funding ultimately led to its closure in 2005.

== Early years — constructive engagement: 1982–1989 ==

The [[Parti Québécois]] (PQ), a party that supports the sovereignty of Quebec and the dominant use of [[French language|French]] in most areas of public and business life, won a majority in the [[Quebec National Assembly]] (the province's legislature) in 1976.  The vast majority of Quebec anglophones (i.e., Quebecers who speak English as a first language), who at that time made up approximately 13% of Quebec's population (see [[Language demographics of Quebec]]), did not support this party.&lt;ref name="books.google.ca"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8BtwoGqOAQoC&amp;pg=PA20 |title=Garth Stevenson, '&amp;#39;Community Besieged'&amp;#39;, p.135 |via=[[Google Books]]|date= |accessdate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some anglophones formed local lobby groups to promote [[federalism]] and argue against new laws such as the [[Charter of the French Language]] (also known as "Bill 101").  After the Parti Québécois was re-elected in 1981, several of these groups (notably the "Positive Action Committee" and the "Council of Quebec Minorities") joined together in May 1982,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ymUxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=8KQFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=alliance%20quebec%20convention&amp;pg=1240%2C1642793 |title=Montreal Gazette (February 27, 1982, p.A5) |publisher=News.google.com |date=1982-02-27 |accessdate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; as "The Alliance of Language Communities in Quebec" (or "Alliance Québec") in an effort to gain more influence and to start a province-level dialogue between linguistic groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1CwhnBqgSpwC&amp;pg=PA124 |title=See Marc Levine, '&amp;#39;The Reconquest of Montreal,'&amp;#39; p.124 |via=[[Google Books]]|date=1982-11-05 |accessdate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AQ's ideology reflected a desire to promote the rights and interests of the English language community while recognizing there were legitimate goals being pursued by the provincial government in promoting the French language, such promotion having strong support in the majority Francophone population. Alliance Quebec's best-known accomplishments from its earliest years included:

* Alliance Quebec's first success was to lobby  the PQ to amend Bill 101. In 1983, the Charter of the French Language was amended (Law 57) to recognize in its preamble to the Charter of the French Language the institutions of the Anglophone community in Québec, abolish language testing for people educated in Quebec, and to widen the use of English in Anglophone communities and public institutions.
* Alliance Quebec also worked to get English language health and social service guarantees. As a result, in 1986, Law 142 was enacted which compels regional authorities to draw up programmes for access in the English language to health and social services throughout Quebec.
* With the financial support and legal leadership of Alliance Quebec, Bill 101's prohibition of English language signs was challenged in court. In 1988, in its decision [[Ford v. Quebec (Attorney General)]], the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] concluded that the prohibition of all other languages but French on public signs and posters and in commercial advertising was in opposition to the freedom of expression but opened the door to the clear predominance of French.  This solution was ultimately adopted by the Government of Quebec and prevails to this day.

The group had widespread grassroots volunteer activity in its early years.  It formed at least 20 regional chapters, including 8 in the anglophone neighbourhoods of Montreal.  The federal government subsidized AQ in an effort to promote minority official language groups in the province, providing it with most of AQ's budget ($1.4 million in 1986).&lt;ref name="news.google.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=booxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=UagFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=alliance-quebec&amp;pg=5735%2C5704854 |title=Montreal Gazette (May 31, 1986, p.B-5) |publisher=News.google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar funding was provided to French language groups outside Quebec.

In addition to AQ's regional chapters, six federally funded anglophone groups outside of Montreal became affiliated with AQ and sent delegates to its annual convention. Affiliated Quebec anglophone universities, [[CEGEP]]s and health and social service institution and community associations were also allowed to send delegates. Institutional members brought AQ substantial public policy expertise and participated in the policy formulation process.

By the end of the 1980s, AQ claimed to have 40,000 people on its membership list&lt;ref name="news.google.com"/&gt; (including members of regional associations affiliated with AQ, such as the [[Townshippers' Association]]). This led to critiques that people who did not renew their memberships were not removed from this list and that the actual number of dues-paying members hovered around 5,000.&lt;ref&gt;Graeme Decarie, CJAD 800 radio (August 1989); see also [http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/s4/f2/dsk2/ftp04/mq24370.pdf Prosperi] at p.59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of Alliance Quebec's founders were active in the [[Liberal Party of Quebec]], the main opposition party while the PQ was in government. The Liberal Party of Quebec won the [[Quebec general election, 1985|provincial election of 1985]], and many of AQ's initial leaders were recruited to work for the new government.  Several of AQ's highly educated and bilingual early staff members went on to become Liberal cabinet ministers in later years, such as [[Thomas Mulcair]], [[Kathleen Weil]], and Geoffrey Kelley (Jacques-Cartier), while others served as [[Quebec National Assembly|MNAs]]—Russell Williams ([[Nelligan (electoral district)|Nelligan]]), [[Russell Copeman]] ([[Notre-Dame-de-Grâce (provincial electoral district)|NDG]]).   While this initially gave AQ strong lobbying contacts within the government, the departure of many of the group's founding leaders eventually hurt the group.  Some have argued that the 1985 election was the beginning of a decline in influence of Alliance Quebec, as English-speakers believed the new government was friendlier and so the need for AQ was lower, while the Liberals had more connections with English-speakers than the PQ and so relied less on AQ to transmit their points of view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8BtwoGqOAQoC&amp;pg=PA201 |title=Garth Stevenson,'&amp;#39;Community Besieged,'&amp;#39; p.201 |via=[[Google Books]]|date= |accessdate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The group also faced criticism, almost since its founding, that it was not aggressive enough in its demands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6WUxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=SaUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1316,1089228&amp;dq=alliance-quebec&amp;hl=en |title="Alliance Quebec report card: full marks for effort", '&amp;#39;Montreal Gazette'&amp;#39; (June 4, 1983) |publisher=News.google.ca |date=1983-06-04 |accessdate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1988, AQ's offices were destroyed in a case of [[arson]].  Then-president [[Royal Orr]] sued ''[[Le Journal de Montréal]]'' and [[CFTM-DT|Télé-Métropole]], for falsely reporting that he was the "prime suspect" in setting the blaze.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=805&amp;dat=19890823&amp;id=b4oNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=JEkDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1230,3792772 |title=Candidate faces tough job|work=Stanstead Journal|date=August 23, 1989 |accessdate=August 18, 2017|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuit was eventually settled out of court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8BtwoGqOAQoC&amp;pg=PA203 |author=Garth Stevenson|title=Community Besieged: The Anglophone Minority and the Politics of Quebec |via=[[Google Books]]|publisher=[[McGill-Queen's University Press]]|date=1999|accessdate=August 18, 2017|page=203|ISBN=9780773518391}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Middle years — stagnation and infighting: 1989–1998 ==

AQ's weakened bargaining position was brought to prominence in 1989 when the Liberal government passed Bill 178.  Although the Liberal Party had campaigned in 1985 to loosen the legal restrictions on languages other than French, Bill 178 overturned the Supreme Court's "Ford" decision (see above), restoring the prohibition on non-French commercial signage (with an exception for small signs inside stores).   Alliance Quebec's inability to prevent the adoption of Bill 178 by the Liberal government it had perceived as an ally, opened it to criticism from the anglophone community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8BtwoGqOAQoC&amp;pg=PA203&amp;lpg=PA203&amp;dq=%22Alliance+Quebec%22+arson&amp;source=web&amp;ots=R-Ui5LRwTS&amp;sig=eHv98zMAPejzb_XY5fktlZBhFLs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ct=result |title=Garth Stevenson, '&amp;#39;Community Besieged'&amp;#39;, p.204 |via=[[Google Books]]|date= |accessdate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Right-wing critics of AQ dubbed it "Compliance Quebec" and "the lamb lobby" for its perceived unwillingness to challenge the government.&lt;ref&gt;Mordecai Richler, Oh Canada, Oh Quebec: Requiem for a Divided Country (Toronto:
Penguin Books, 1992), 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Internal tension arose among the directors of AQ over the issue of denied access to English language schools in the province. Tensions increased over whether or not to support the Liberals in the [[Quebec general election, 1989|Quebec general election of 1989]] in spite of Bill 178.  Some prominent AQ leaders urged a protest vote by anglophones, either by spoiling their ballots or voting for the upstart [[Equality Party (Quebec)|Equality Party]] that opposed the Liberals' legislation. The Equality Party won four seats in the [[National Assembly of Quebec|National Assembly]] in 1989, but quickly lost its support due to infighting, garnering only 0.3% of the [[Quebec general election, 1994#Results|vote in 1994]].  Rebuffed at the ballot box, some of the Equality Party's remaining active members instead concentrated on winning elected positions in Alliance Quebec&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.montrealmirror.com/ARCHIVES/1998/040998/cover.html |title=Philip Preville, "Million Dollar Bill", Montreal Mirror (April 9, 1998) |publisher=Montrealmirror.com |date=1998-04-09 |accessdate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to have AQ promote the Equality Party's platform (notably, favouring a complete repeal of all mandatory use of French in Quebec, and partitioning Quebec in the event of independence). Public infighting between so-called "moderates" (sympathetic to the Liberal Party) and "radicals" (the remaining members of the Equality Party) within AQ throughout the 1990s, along with a gradual decrease in interest among the general Quebec population in [[language politics]], led to the marginalization of AQ in the province's politics.

While infighting preoccupied the board of directors and annual convention, the grassroots elements of AQ became less active. Government funding allowed for a permanent staff for the group, which relied less and less on volunteers. AQ's smallest regional chapters, in Quebec's [[Magdalen Islands]], [[Basse-Côte-Nord|Lower North Shore]] and [[Baie-Comeau]], closed down for lack of members,&lt;ref&gt;Two members of these closed chapters could attend the annual convention: see [http://www.laurentianweb.com/aqinfo1.htm Laurentianweb, "Alliance Quebec Information: Regional Community Organizations"]&lt;/ref&gt; while six of the group's eight chapters on the [[Island of Montreal]] merged in order to avoid closing.&lt;ref&gt;The new Montreal Chapter could send six times as many delegates to the annual convention as the other chapters; see [http://www.laurentianweb.com/aqinfo1.htm LaurentianWeb, "Alliance Quebec Information"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, the [[Chief Electoral Officer of Quebec]] investigated alleged irregularities during the [[1995 Quebec sovereignty referendum]], finding among other things that votes in three mainly federalist [[Electoral district (Canada)|ridings]] had been rejected without valid reasons. Alliance Quebec sued the Quebec government to try to force it to re-examine the rejected ballots in all 125 Quebec ridings. The trial judge ruled against AQ in 2000. AQ appealed, but ceased operations in 2005 (see below). In 2008 the Chief Electoral Officer got the court's permission to destroy the ballots after ruling that AQ's appeal had taken too long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/montreal/story/2008/05/01/qc-referendumballots0501.html |title=CBC News (May 1, 2008) |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=2008-05-01 |accessdate=2011-04-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502083406/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/montreal/story/2008/05/01/qc-referendumballots0501.html |archivedate=May 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Final years — radicalization and closure: 1998–2005 ==

In May 1998, the group elected a "radical" president, [[Montreal Gazette]] columnist [[William Johnson (author)|William Johnson]]. Previously a vocal critic of AQ, he won by rallying a group known derisively as "angryphones" (mainly members of the tiny Equality Party and some listeners of right wing talk radio shows, particularly the [[Howard Galganov]] show).  He in turn supported Equality Party members for positions on AQ's board of directors.  Unlike previous presidents, he made no attempt to meet with political leaders, preferring to conduct his lobbying through media, such as on radio talk shows.  Also unlike previous presidents, who generally accepted the objectives of Bill 101 and focused on changing how it was applied, Johnson questioned the commitment to tolerance and human rights of those who supported Bill 101.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g., W. Johnson, "The Historical Background of the Situation of English-speaking Quebecers", quoted in ''[http://www.neuvel.net/Quebec_ling.htm Language and Language Laws in Quebec]''&lt;/ref&gt;

After his election, Johnson organized two demonstrations against stores, in particular [[Eaton's]] and [[The Hudson's Bay Company]], that did not place English on their in-store advertising&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/1998/10/03/signs981003a.html |title=CBC News |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=1998-11-13 |accessdate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; (which was once again legal after amendments to the Charter of the French Language in 1994). Johnson told a crowd of demonstrators that he refused an Eaton's offer to put up English signs in their stores if AQ would quietly call off the protest, as Johnson wanted to make it a public issue.  Johnson also had AQ's constitution amended to add his view that Canada's federal government should refuse to recognize a Quebec unilateral [[declaration of independence]].   Johnson also made headlines when the [[Entartistes]] threw a cream pie in his face while he marched in Montreal's 1998 [[Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day]] parade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.canada.com/montrealgazette/features/viewpoints/story.html?id=79c98166-3381-429f-8a64-856ac7f1d527&amp;p=1 |title=Montreal Gazette (16 June 2009) |publisher=.canada.com |date=2009-06-16 |accessdate=2011-04-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017141122/http://www2.canada.com/montrealgazette/features/viewpoints/story.html?id=79c98166-3381-429f-8a64-856ac7f1d527&amp;p=1 |archive-date=2013-10-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson's presidential campaign and his first six months as president temporarily brought more media attention and members to Alliance Quebec, as the PQ government and Quebec nationalist groups publicly criticized AQ's new, more confrontational tone.  However, Johnson called off the group's protests in October 1998&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.highbeam.com/4341/article-1G1-21193947/precarious-peace |title=Maclean's (October 12, 1998) |publisher=Business.highbeam.com |date=1998-10-12 |accessdate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and AQ's media coverage fell considerably, never to recover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/archivesearch?q=%22Alliance+Quebec%22+source%3A%22-newswire%22+source%3A%22-wire%22+source%3A%22-presswire%22+source%3A%22-PR%22+source%3A%22-press%22+source%3A%22-release%22+source%3A%22-wikipedia%22&amp;btnG=Search+Archives&amp;scoring=a |title=Google News archive for "Alliance Quebec" |publisher=News.google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Johnson's presidency and those of his similarly minded successors also provoked a negative reaction from the mainstream community of anglophones that formerly supported AQ. Links to the community's key healthcare, educational and community institutions vanished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2000/02/01/bill001201.html |title=CBC News February 1, 2000 |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=2000-02-02 |accessdate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several events during these years highlighted the group's lack of support, which ultimately caused it to close down:

A second series of funding cuts (to $200,000 annually) came in 2003-2004 after federal government dissatisfaction with AQ's lack of spending controls and a drop in its membership and influence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.francisscarpaleggia.parl.gc.ca/pub_details.asp?lang=en&amp;pubID=1014 Francis Scarpaleggia, MP]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the [[Department of Canadian Heritage]] finally discontinued its grant in 2005 after AQ failed to produce audited [[financial statements]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://cf.groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/Pour-le-Pays-du-Quebec/conversations/topics/16057?var=1 T.

== Structure ==

Alliance Quebec was registered as a non-profit association in Quebec, with a headquarters in Montreal.  Anyone could join as a member by paying a nominal fee of $5–$10.  Membership entitled them to participate in the regional chapter in which they lived.  Each regional chapter had its own board of directors and executive and obtained their budget mainly from membership fees.

Each chapter could send 9 delegates to the annual convention, which took place each May in Montreal.  In the 1990s, six chapters in central Montreal merged, which allowed the merged chapter to send up to 54 delegates.  (In the William Johnson era, the [[West Island]] chapter's number of delegates was increased to reflect that it was the chapter with the second-largest number of members.)  A youth commission of members under thirty years of age also existed and could send up to 18 delegates to the convention.  Affiliated groups such as the Townshippers' Association could also send delegates, as could affiliated universities, hospitals and community groups.  The outgoing president and board of directors were also entitled to vote at the convention, representing 41 delegates. In theory, an annual convention could have nearly 400 delegates during the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Chris Goodfellow |url=http://www.laurentianweb.com/aqinfo1.htm#delegate |title="Alliance Quebec Information" (1998) |publisher=LaurentianWeb |date=1998-05-01 |accessdate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In practice, the number of delegates attending annual conventions decreased over time as membership fell and affiliated groups stopped participating; the annual convention in 1985 had about 470 delegates&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lhUyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=2aUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=eric-maldoff&amp;pg=2286%2C31365 |title=Montreal Gazette (May 1, 1985, p.A4) |publisher=News.google.com |date=1985-05-01 |accessdate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; while each of the conventions from 1999 onward had under 100 delegates.

The annual convention chose the president and [[treasurer]] of AQ for the upcoming year. (In the William Johnson era, the president's term was lengthened to two years, although each subsequent president resigned before the end of their full two-year term.)  The delegates would also choose the board of directors.  Half of the forty-person board of directors of AQ would be up for election annually for a two-year term; the top twenty candidates who received the most votes being elected.  The new board of directors would meet immediately after the convention to choose the remaining executive positions, including [[vice president]], vice president "off-[[Island of Montreal|island]]" (meaning from outside of Montreal), [[Secretary (club)|secretary]], and [[chairman of the board]].  The group also had an "Advisory Council" of prominent anglophones to advise the group on important issues from time to time, but this fell into disuse by the late 1990s.

The executives and directors were [[Volunteering|volunteer]] positions (although the president received a [[stipend]].)  There were also a number of paid staff members (around two dozen in 1994),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/s4/f2/dsk2/ftp04/mq24370.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; such as a general director, a fundraiser, receptionists, researchers and organizers, paid for mainly from federal government grants.

For most of its existence, AQ also maintained committees to study issues.  These included (at various times)committees for health and social services, education, access to English schools, youth employment, legal affairs, communication, internal rules, and membership.  Some committees organized events and activities. One of these activities, "Youth Employment Services", became independent of AQ in the 1990s and continues to operate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yesmontreal.ca/yes.php] Youth Employment Services website&lt;/ref&gt;  Larger chapters also had some committees, especially in the group's early years.

The '''CMU Pronouncing Dictionary''' (also known as '''CMUdict''') is an [[open-source software|open-source]] pronouncing [[dictionary]] originally created by the Speech Group at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] (CMU) for use in [[speech recognition]] research.

CMUdict provides a mapping orthopraphic/phonetic for English words in their North American pronunciations. It is commonly used to generate representations for [[speech recognition]] (ASR), e.g. the [[CMU Sphinx]] system, and [[speech synthesis]] (TTS), e.g. the [[Festival Speech Synthesis System|Festival]] system. CMUdict can be used as a training corpus for building statistical grapheme-to-phoneme (g2p) models&lt;ref&gt;http://www-i6.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/web/Software/g2p.html&lt;/ref&gt; that will generate pronunciations for words not yet included in the dictionary.

The most recent release is 0.7b; it contains over 134,000 entries. An interactive lookup version is available.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict&lt;/ref&gt;

==Database Format==
The database is distributed as a plain text file with one entry to a line in the format "&lt;code&gt;WORD&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;pronunciation&gt;&lt;/code&gt;" with a two-space separator between the parts. If  multiple pronunciations are available for a word, variants are identified using numbered versions (e.g. &lt;code&gt;WORD(1)&lt;/code&gt;). The pronunciation is encoded using a modified form of the [[ARPABET]] system, with the addition of stress marks on vowels of levels 0, 1, and 2. A line-initial &lt;code&gt;;;;&lt;/code&gt; token indicates a comment. A derived format, directly suitable for speech recognition engines is also available as part of the distribution; this format collapses stress distinctions (typically not used in ASR).

==Biography==
Ching Hai was born Hue Dang Trinh to a Vietnamese mother and a Chinese father, on 12 May 1950 in a small village in the [[Quảng Ngãi Province]] in Vietnam.&lt;ref name="young"&gt;{{cite news

In 1969, she began a relationship with a German scientist.&lt;ref name="partridge" /&gt;&lt;ref name="guzman"&gt;{{cite news | last = Guzmán | first = Rafer  | title = Immaterial Girl | work = Metro | date = 28 March 1996 | url = http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/03.28.96/suma-9613.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; They married, but separated after two years to focus on spiritualism.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt; In 1979, she met a [[Buddhist]] monk in Germany whom she followed for three years, but his monastery denied entry to females.&lt;ref name="guzman"/&gt; She moved to India to study different religions.{{when|date=August 2017}}

Hai attempted to buy a copy of the [[Bhagavad Gita]] from a bookshop near the Ganges.  Despite the shopkeepers' assertion that they had not got a copy, an extensive search revealed one in a sealed box.  This led to rumours of her having a [[third eye]] circulating by 1982.&lt;ref name=thornton08&gt;Thornton, Patricia M. (2008) ''Manufacturing Dissent in Transnational China'' in "Popular Protest in China", Kevin J. O'Brien (ed.), Harvard University Press, pp. 189–192&lt;/ref&gt;. In 1983, she met a Vietnamese Buddhist monk in [[Taiwan]] named Jing-Xing, who ordained her in 1984 as "Thanh Hai", meaning "pure ocean".&lt;ref name="guzman"/&gt;

According to her official biography, Ching Hai was born to a well-off [[naturopathy|naturopathic]] family in [[Âu Lạc]], Hanoi, Vietnam. Though raised as a [[Roman Catholic]], she learned the basics of Buddhism from her grandmother. A Himalayas spiritual teacher showed her a particular meditation method which she named ''Quan Yin method''.&lt;ref name="offbio"&gt;{{cite news | author = Supreme Master Ching Hai | title = God's Direct Contact | publisher = Supreme Master Ching Hai International Association | date = March 2009 | url = http://godsdirectcontact.us/bio.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her meditations centres in American cities such as Los Angeles benefit from tax-exempt status as religious organizations.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt;  She presides over an organization which owns restaurants and sells her jewellery and clothes.&lt;ref name="guzman"/&gt;

==Corporate operations==
Hai founded the [[Loving Hut]] restaurant chains&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lovinghut.com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101102075710/http://lovinghut.com/ |archivedate=2 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.sfweekly.com/foodie/2010/05/loving_hut_opens_in_the_san_fr.php |title=Vegan Fast-Food Loving Hut Opens in San Francisco Centre Food Court |work=SF Weekly website: SFoodie blog |date=3 May 2010 |publisher=SF Weekly |accessdate=11 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 138 restaurants worldwide in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

She launched a clothing line in New York and Paris in 1995.&lt;ref name="reliefworks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.godsdirectcontact.org.tw/humanitarian/index1.php |title=The Supreme Master Ching Hai International Association, Humanitarian Relief Activities |publisher=Godsdirectcontact.org.tw |accessdate=3 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has authored picture books, such as ''The Birds in My Life'' and ''The Noble Wilds''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Supreme-Master-Ching-Hai/e/B002BM095G |title=The Supreme Master Ching Hai: Books, Biography, Blog, Audiobooks, Kindle |publisher=Amazon.com |accessdate=3 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The books consist of photos she has taken.

Her organization hosts websites which offer digital downloads of her media in 17 languages as well as a "Celestial Shop" which sells apparel and jewelry designed by Hai.&lt;ref name=thornton08/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecelestialshop.com/ |title=The Official Online Shop for Celestial Products |publisher=The Celestial Shop |accessdate=3 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supreme Master Ching Hai International===
Hai has founded organizations including the Supreme Master Ching Hai International, World Peace Media, Oceans of Love Entertainment and Supreme Master Television. Her organization runs an international vegetarian restaurants chain, some of which sell her merchandise.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

In late 2008 Ching Hai launched a media campaign in Australia and New Zealand asking people to "Be Green, Go Veg, Save the Planet".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
| url         = http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/bleak-days-at-cape-grim-as-beef-bashed/story-e6frg6ox-1225791165315

The Supreme Master Ching Hai International Association has made submissions to the [[Garnaut Climate Change Review]], advocating large cuts to livestock production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.garnautreview.org.au/CA25734E0016A131/WebObj/D0841971GeneralSubmission-SupremeMasterChingHaiInternational/$File/D0841971%20General%20Submission%20-%20Supreme%20Master%20Ching%20Hai%20International.pdf Ching Hai's submission] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080721155305/http://www.garnautreview.org.au/CA25734E0016A131/WebObj/D0841971GeneralSubmission-SupremeMasterChingHaiInternational/%24File/D0841971%20General%20Submission%20-%20Supreme%20Master%20Ching%20Hai%20International.pdf |date=21 July 2008 }} to the Garnaut Climate Change&lt;/ref&gt;

According to political scientist Patricia Thornton at the [[University of Oxford]], the Ching Hai World Society's heavy reliance on the internet for text distribution, recruitment and information-sharing, marks the group as a transnational "[[cybersect]]."&lt;ref name=thornton08/&gt; Thornton claimed that the source of income behind Hai's numerous business ventures is unknown &lt;ref name=thornton08/&gt; and that much of the media produced by her television programmes is heavily self-referential and promotional and aims to "build a public record of recognition for group activities."&lt;ref name=thornton08 /&gt;

==Quan Yin method==
Hai first demonstrated the "Immeasurable Light Meditation Center and the Way of Sound Contemplation" or Quan Yin method of meditation in Miaoli, Taiwan.&lt;ref name=thornton08/&gt; The method is very similar to the [[Surat Shabd Yoga]] method from the ''[[Sant Mat]]'' tradition.

Hai has said that she did not invent the Quan Yin method of meditation, but she merely "knows" it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news 
  | author = Supreme Master Ching Hai
  | title = Master's Words: The Quan Yin Method is an Eternal Universal Law

  | date = 17 December 1998
  | url = http://godsdirectcontact.us/sm21/enews/www/178/mt_0.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her book ''The Key of Immediate Enlightenment'' she claims that those who recite her name would become spiritually elevated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

 |date= 3 January 1999
 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The method involves meditation on the "inner light and the inner sound of God", or the [[Shabd]]. Hai claims that the [[Bible]] acknowledged the existence of this method and that it has been repeatedly re-used by most major religions.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt; The Quan Yin Method requires two and a half hours of meditation per day and adherence to five precepts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

  | date = 25 March 2010
  | url = http://www.godsdirectcontact.org.tw/eng1/quanyin/subquanyin/five.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; similar to the [[Five Precepts]] of [[Buddhism]].

===Quan Yin method in China===
By 1996, several thousand residents of [[China]] were practitioners of the method.

The Chinese government claimed that the organization's beliefs and activities were fundamentally "anti-communist" and called the group a "reactionary religious organization".&lt;ref name=thornton08/&gt;

In 2002, the manager of the Wuhan Zhongzhi Electric Testing Equipment Company was accused by the Chinese authorities of using the business as a cover to "support [[Heresy|heresies]]" associated with the Quan Yin method.&lt;ref name=thornton08/&gt; The enterprise supported thirty practitioners who "masqueraded as employees and business associates." The manager was charged with using the company's offices and buildings as "retreat sites", organizing "initiations" and "screenings" to recruit members, and illegally printing and distributing more than 6,000 copies of heretical texts.&lt;ref name=thornton08/&gt;

==Controversies==
The Taiwan government has investigated Hai's organization for "alleged fund-raising improprieties", which included a transfer of $2&amp;nbsp;million outside of the country.&lt;ref name="chua" /&gt;

Hai gave $640,000 to [[Bill Clinton]]'s Presidential Legal Expenses Trust which it returned in 1996 because of "suspicious" funding sources.&lt;ref name="lat"&gt;{{cite web|title=In Ching Hai, Clinton finds new type of special interest|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-12-20/news/mn-11036_1_ching-hai-group|website=www.latimes.com|accessdate=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wp-2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Behind Clinton fund donations, sect with a flamboyant leader|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1996/12/19/behind-clinton-fund-donations-sect-with-a-flamboyant-leader/0d9332ac-dc9d-4b67-af91-24a57ac4a1ae/|website=www.washingtonpost.com|accessdate=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, an artificial island and a {{convert|330|ft|m|adj=mid}} long boardwalk created in [[Biscayne National Park]] cost $1&amp;nbsp;million USD to remove after being illegally constructed by workers at a property owned by Ching Hai, known locally as under the pseudonym Celestia De Lamour.&lt;ref name="miami"&gt;{{cite news

The private property owned by Ching Hai adjacent to the national park was seized by police and later sold at auction to the village of [[Palmetto Bay, Florida|Palmetto Bay]], which planned to establish a park on the site.&lt;ref name="palmetto"&gt;{{cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2034">'''Consequences''' is an old [[parlour game]] in a similar vein to the [[Surrealist techniques|Surrealist game]] ''[[exquisite corpse]]'' and ''[[Mad Libs]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.madlibs.com/category/history/ The Happy History of Mad Libs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080310212035/http://www.madlibs.com/category/history/ |date=2008-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each person takes a turn writing a word or phrase forming part of a set structure in order to build a story.  The exact sequence varies, but a typical sequence is:
# Adjective for man
# Man's name
# Adjective for woman
# Woman's name
# Where they met
# What he wore
# What she wore
# What he said to her
# What she said to him
# The consequence (a description of what happened after)
# What the world said

Then the story is read (for example):

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Mediocre Joe'' met ''transparent Kim'' at ''the bowling alley''.
Joe wore ''a seafoam green leisure suit''.
Kim wore ''a sandwich board''.
Joe said to Kim “''During the last storm, we had a little party in the mud''.”
Kim said “''She wasn’t that into me''.”
As a consequence, ''the band got back together''.
And the world said “''Somehow, I think I saw this coming.''”
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The game is traditionally played by writing the words on paper and folding the paper to hide the previous words before passing it to the next player.

Consequences can also be played in a drawing version, disambiguated under the name "[[picture consequences]]", where the first player draws the head, passes it unseen (by means of folding) to the second player who draws the body, then on to the third player who draws the legs. The composite person or creature is then revealed to all by unfolding the paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/10428382/Perfectly-silly-party-games.html|title=Perfectly silly party games|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3704">'''Constructive notice''' is the [[legal fiction]]&lt;ref group='nb'&gt;The phrase "legal fiction" should not be construed to mean that the concept of constructive notice is legally invalid.&lt;/ref&gt; that signifies that a person or [[entity]] should have known, as a reasonable person would have, of a legal action taken or to be taken, even if they have no actual knowledge of it.

The doctrine is generally construed with regards to legal notices published, either by posting them at a designated place in a courthouse, or publishing them in a [[newspaper of record|newspaper designated for legal notices]].  Because both methods of publication are available to the general public (courthouses being open to all members of the general public, and newspapers readily available in public places such as libraries), the person to whom the notice is being issued (even if issued in a generic form, such as "To All Heirs of John Smith, a Resident of Smith County") is considered to have received notice even if they were not actually aware of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/constructive_notice | title=constructive notice | publisher=Legal information institute | accessdate=November 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/constructive+notice | title=constructive notice | publisher=legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com | accessdate=November 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another use of constructive notice is in the recording of [[deed]]s, [[mortgage]]s, [[lien]]s, and similar documents in [[recorder of deeds#United States: recorders of deeds|county registries]] in the United States.  Since such documents are considered public information and can be accessed by any member of the public, such recordings are considered constructive notice of land conveyances or encumbrances having taken place.

In [[companies law]] the doctrine of constructive notice is a [[Legal doctrine|doctrine]] where all persons dealing with a company are deemed (or "construed") to have knowledge of the company's [[articles of association]] and [[memorandum of association]]. The doctrine of [[indoor management]] is an exception to this rule.

The [[New York City Housing Court]] allows use of the concept of constructive notice by either the tenant or the landlord. For example, constructive notice could be given to a landlord if a broken and unsupported metal grate on a public sidewalk collapses when stepped on by a pedestrian. The landlord is reasonably expected to know that this is a safety hazard.
==Indoor management==
The harshness of the doctrine of constructive notice is somewhat reduced by the "Rule of Indoor management" or "Turquand's Rule". The Rule derives its name from the case of ''[[Royal British Bank v Turquand]]'', where the defendant was the [[liquidator (law)|liquidator]] of the insolvent [[Cameron's Coalbrook Steam, Coal and Swansea and Loughor Railway Company]]. The company had borrowed from [[Royal British Bank]] by giving a bond worth £2,000.

The articles of the company stated that the directors could only borrow if authorised by a resolution of the company's general meeting, and could not borrow more than the amount specified in the resolution.

The articles were registered with [[Companies House]] so there was constructive notice. But the bank could not have known about the resolution, as they were not registrable and thus were not a public document. The bond was held valid and there was no requirement to know the company's internal workings.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Royal British Bank v Turquand]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|the hypothesis in set theory|the assumption in fluid mechanics|Fluid mechanics}}
In [[mathematics]], the '''continuum hypothesis''' (abbreviated '''CH''') is a hypothesis about the possible sizes of [[infinite set]]s. It states:
{{quote|There is no set whose [[cardinality]] is strictly between that of the [[integer]]s and the [[real number]]s.}}

The continuum hypothesis was advanced by [[Georg Cantor]] in 1878, and
establishing its truth or falsehood is the first of [[Hilbert's problems|Hilbert's 23&amp;nbsp;problems]] presented in 1900. Τhe answer to this problem is [[independence (mathematical logic)|independent]] of [[ZFC set theory]] (that is, Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the [[axiom of choice]] included), so that either the continuum hypothesis or its negation can be added as an axiom to ZFC set theory, with the resulting theory being consistent if and only if ZFC is consistent. This independence was proved in 1963 by [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]], complementing earlier work by [[Kurt Gödel]] in 1940.

The name of the hypothesis comes from the term ''[[continuum (set theory)|the continuum]]'' for the real numbers.
==History==
Cantor believed the continuum hypothesis to be true and tried for many years to prove it, in vain {{harv|Dauben|1990}}. It became the first on David Hilbert's [[Hilbert's problems|list of important open questions]] that was presented at the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] in the year 1900 in Paris. [[Axiomatic set theory]] was at that point not yet formulated. 
[[Kurt Gödel]] proved in 1940 that the negation of the continuum hypothesis, i.e., the existence of a set with intermediate cardinality, could not be proved in standard set theory.  The second half of the independence of the continuum hypothesis – i.e., unprovability of the nonexistence of an intermediate-sized set – was proved in 1963 by [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]].

==Cardinality of infinite sets==
{{Main|Cardinal number}}

Two sets are said to have the same ''[[cardinality]]'' or ''[[cardinal number]]'' if there exists a [[bijection]] (a one-to-one correspondence) between them. Intuitively, for two sets ''S'' and ''T'' to have the same cardinality means that it is possible to "pair off" elements of ''S'' with elements of ''T'' in such a fashion that every element of ''S'' is paired off with exactly one element of ''T'' and vice versa. Hence, the set {banana, apple, pear} has the same cardinality as {yellow, red, green}.

With infinite sets such as the set of [[integer]]s or [[rational number]]s, the existence of a bijection between two sets becomes more difficult to demonstrate. The rational numbers seemingly form a counterexample to the continuum hypothesis: the integers form a proper subset of the rationals, which themselves form a proper subset of the reals, so intuitively, there are more rational numbers than integers and more real numbers than rational numbers.  However, this intuitive analysis is flawed; it does not take proper account of the fact that all three sets are [[infinite set|infinite]].  It turns out the rational numbers can actually be placed in one-to-one correspondence with the integers, and therefore the set of rational numbers is the same size (''cardinality'') as the set of integers: they are both [[countable set]]s.

Cantor gave two proofs that the cardinality of the set of [[integer]]s is strictly smaller than that of the set of [[real number]]s (see [[Cantor's first uncountability proof]] and [[Cantor's diagonal argument]]). His proofs, however, give no indication of the extent to which the cardinality of the integers is less than that of the real numbers. Cantor proposed the continuum hypothesis as a possible solution to this question.

The continuum hypothesis states that the set of real numbers has minimal possible cardinality which is greater than the cardinality of the set of integers. That is, every set, ''S'', of real numbers can either be mapped one-to-one into the integers or the real numbers can be mapped one-to-one into ''S''. Using the fact that the real numbers are [[equinumerous]] with the powerset of the integers, the continuum hypothesis says that there is no set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; for which &lt;math&gt; \aleph_0 &lt; |S| &lt; 2^{\aleph_0}. &lt;/math&gt;

Assuming the [[axiom of choice]], [[aleph numbers|there is a smallest cardinal number &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt; greater than &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;]], and the continuum hypothesis is in turn equivalent to the equality &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0} = \aleph_1. &lt;/math&gt;

There is also a generalization of the continuum hypothesis called the '''generalized continuum hypothesis''' ('''GCH''') which says that for every [[Ordinal number|ordinal]] &amp;alpha;, &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_\alpha} = \aleph_{\alpha+1}.&lt;/math&gt; That is, GCH asserts that the cardinality of the [[power set]] of each infinite set is the smallest cardinality greater than that of the set.

==Independence from ZFC==

The independence of the continuum hypothesis (CH) from [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] (ZF) follows from combined work of [[Kurt Gödel]]  and [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]].

{{harvtxt|Gödel|1940}} showed that CH cannot be disproved from ZF, even if the [[axiom of choice]] (AC) is adopted (making ZFC). Gödel's proof shows that CH and AC both hold in the [[constructible universe]] L, an [[inner model]] of ZF set theory, assuming only the axioms of ZF.  The existence of an inner model of ZF  in which additional axioms hold shows that the additional axioms are [[consistent]] with ZF, provided ZF itself is consistent. The latter condition cannot be proved in ZF itself, due to [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]], but is widely believed to be true and can be proved in stronger set theories.

Cohen ([[#{{harvid|Cohen|1963}}|1963]], [[#{{harvid|Cohen|1964}}|1964]]) showed that CH cannot be proven from the ZFC axioms, completing the overall independence proof.  To prove his result, Cohen developed the method of [[Forcing (mathematics)|forcing]], which has become a standard tool in set theory.  Essentially, this method begins with a model of ZF in which CH holds, and constructs another model which contains more sets than the original, in a way that CH does not hold in the new model. Cohen was awarded the [[Fields Medal]] in 1966 for his proof.

The independence proof just described shows that CH is independent of ZFC. Further research has shown that CH is independent of all known ''[[large cardinal axiom]]s'' in the context of ZFC. ({{harvtxt|Feferman|1999}})   Moreover, it has been shown that the cardinality of the continuum can be any cardinal consistent with [[König's theorem (set theory)|König's theorem]]. A result of Solovay, proved shortly after Cohen's result on the independence of the continuum hypothesis, shows that in any model of ZFC, if &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; is a cardinal of uncountable [[cofinality]], then there is a forcing extension in which &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0} = \kappa&lt;/math&gt;. However, per König's theorem, it is not consistent to assume &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\aleph_\omega&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\aleph_{\omega_1+\omega}&lt;/math&gt; or any cardinal with cofinality &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;.

The continuum hypothesis is closely related to many statements in [[mathematical analysis|analysis]], point set [[topology]] and [[measure theory]]. As a result of its independence, many substantial [[conjecture]]s in those fields have subsequently been shown to be independent as well.

The independence from ZFC means that proving or disproving the CH within ZFC is impossible.  However, Gödel and Cohen's negative results are not universally accepted as disposing of all interest in the continuum hypothesis. Hilbert's problem remains an active topic of research; see {{harvs|last=Woodin|year=2001a|year2=2001b|txt}} and {{harvtxt|Koellner|2011a}} for an overview of the current research status.

The continuum hypothesis was not the first statement shown to be independent of ZFC. An immediate consequence of [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]], which was published in 1931, is that there is a formal statement (one for each appropriate [[Gödel numbering]] scheme) expressing the consistency of ZFC that is independent of ZFC, assuming that ZFC is consistent. The continuum hypothesis and the [[axiom of choice]] were among the first mathematical statements shown to be independent of ZF set theory.

==Arguments for and against the continuum hypothesis==
Gödel believed that CH is false, and that his proof that CH is consistent with ZFC only shows that the [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|Zermelo–Fraenkel]] axioms do not adequately characterize the universe of sets.  Gödel was a [[Philosophy of mathematics#Platonism|platonist]] and therefore had no problems with asserting the truth and falsehood of statements independent of their provability. Cohen, though a [[Formalism (mathematics)|formalist]] {{harv|Goodman|1979}}, also tended towards rejecting CH.

Historically, mathematicians who favored a "rich" and "large" [[universe (mathematics)|universe]] of sets were against CH, while those favoring a "neat" and "controllable" universe favored CH. Parallel arguments were made for and against the [[axiom of constructibility]], which implies CH. More recently, [[Matthew Foreman]] has pointed out that [[ontological maximalism]] can actually be used to argue in favor of CH, because among models that have the same reals, models with "more" sets of reals have a better chance of satisfying CH (Maddy 1988, p.&amp;nbsp;500).

Another viewpoint is that the conception of set is not specific enough to determine whether CH is true or false. This viewpoint was advanced as early as 1923 by [[Skolem]], even before Gödel's first incompleteness theorem. Skolem argued on the basis of what is now known as [[Skolem's paradox]], and it was later supported by the independence of CH from the axioms of ZFC since these axioms are enough to establish the elementary properties of sets and cardinalities. In order to argue against this viewpoint, it would be sufficient to demonstrate new axioms that are supported by intuition and resolve CH in one direction or another. Although the [[axiom of constructibility]] does resolve CH, it is not generally considered to be intuitively true any more than CH is generally considered to be false (Kunen 1980, p.&amp;nbsp;171).

At least two other axioms have been proposed that have implications for the continuum hypothesis, although these axioms have not currently found wide acceptance in the mathematical community. In 1986, Chris Freiling presented an argument against CH by showing that the negation of CH is equivalent to [[Freiling's axiom of symmetry]], a statement about [[probability|probabilities]]. Freiling believes this axiom is "intuitively true" but others have disagreed. A difficult argument against CH developed by [[W. Hugh Woodin]] has attracted considerable attention since the year 2000 (Woodin 2001a, 2001b). Foreman (2003) does not reject Woodin's argument outright but urges caution.

[[Solomon Feferman]] (2011) has made a complex philosophical argument that CH is not a definite mathematical problem.  He proposes a theory of "definiteness" using a semi-intuitionistic subsystem of ZF that accepts [[classical logic]] for bounded quantifiers but uses [[intuitionistic logic]] for unbounded ones, and suggests that a proposition &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is mathematically "definite" if the semi-intuitionistic theory can prove &lt;math&gt;(\phi \lor \neg\phi)&lt;/math&gt;.  He conjectures that CH is not definite according to this notion, and proposes that CH should, therefore, be considered not to have a truth value. [[Peter Koellner]] (2011b) wrote a critical commentary on Feferman's article.

[[Joel David Hamkins]] proposes a [[Multiverse (set theory)|multiverse]] approach to set theory and argues that "the continuum hypothesis is settled on the multiverse view by our extensive knowledge about how it behaves in the multiverse, and, as a result, it can no longer be settled in the manner formerly hoped for." (Hamkins 2012). In a related vein, [[Saharon Shelah]] wrote that he does "not agree with the pure Platonic view that the interesting problems in set theory can be decided, that we just have to discover the additional axiom. My mental picture is that we have many possible set theories, all conforming to ZFC." (Shelah 2003).

==The generalized continuum hypothesis==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Forcing (mathematics)]] --&gt;
The ''generalized continuum hypothesis'' (GCH) states that if an infinite set's cardinality lies between that of an infinite set ''S'' and that of the [[power set]] of ''S'', then it either has the same cardinality as the set ''S'' or the same cardinality as the power set of ''S''. That is, for any [[infinite set|infinite]] [[cardinal number|cardinal]] &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; there is no cardinal &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\lambda &lt;\kappa &lt;2^{\lambda}.&lt;/math&gt; GCH is equivalent to:
:&lt;math&gt;\aleph_{\alpha+1}=2^{\aleph_\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; for every [[ordinal number|ordinal]] &lt;math&gt;\alpha.&lt;/math&gt;  (occasionally called '''Cantor's aleph hypothesis''')
The [[beth number]]s provide an alternate notation for this condition: &lt;math&gt;\aleph_\alpha=\beth_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; for every ordinal &lt;math&gt;\alpha.&lt;/math&gt;

This is a generalization of the continuum hypothesis since the continuum has the same cardinality as the [[power set]] of the integers. It was first suggested by {{harvs|txt|last=Jourdain|authorlink=Philip Jourdain|year=1905}}. (For the early history of GCH, see {{harvs|txt|last=Moore|year=2011}}).

Like CH, GCH is also independent of ZFC, but [[Wacław Sierpiński|Sierpiński]] proved that ZF + GCH implies the [[axiom of choice]] (AC) (and therefore the negation of the [[axiom of determinacy]], AD), so choice and GCH are not independent in ZF; there are no models of ZF in which GCH holds and AC fails. To prove this, Sierpiński showed GCH implies that every cardinality n is smaller than some [[Aleph number]], and thus can be ordered. This is done by showing that n is smaller than &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0+n}&lt;/math&gt; which is  smaller than its own [[Hartogs number]]—this uses the equality &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0+n}\, = \,2\cdot\,2^{\aleph_0+n} &lt;/math&gt;; for the full proof, see Gillman (2002).

[[Kurt Gödel]] showed that GCH is a consequence of ZF + [[Axiom of constructibility|V=L]] (the axiom that every set is constructible relative to the ordinals), and is therefore consistent with ZFC. As GCH implies CH, Cohen's model in which CH fails is a model in which GCH fails, and thus GCH is not provable from ZFC. W.&amp;nbsp;B.&amp;nbsp;Easton used the method of forcing developed by Cohen to prove [[Easton's theorem]], which shows it is consistent with ZFC for arbitrarily large cardinals &lt;math&gt;\aleph_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; to fail to satisfy &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_\alpha} = \aleph_{\alpha + 1}.&lt;/math&gt; Much later, [[Matthew Foreman|Foreman]] and [[W. Hugh Woodin|Woodin]] proved that (assuming the consistency of very large cardinals) it is consistent that &lt;math&gt;2^\kappa&gt;\kappa^+&lt;/math&gt; holds for every infinite cardinal &lt;math&gt;\kappa.&lt;/math&gt; Later Woodin extended this by showing the consistency of &lt;math&gt;2^\kappa=\kappa^{++}&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;. {{harvs|first=Carmi|last=Merimovich|year=2007|txt}} showed that, for each ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1, it is consistent with ZFC that for each κ, 2&lt;sup&gt;κ&lt;/sup&gt; is the ''n''th successor of κ. On the other hand, {{harvs|first=László |last=Patai|year=1930|txt}} proved, that if γ is an ordinal and for each infinite cardinal κ, 2&lt;sup&gt;κ&lt;/sup&gt; is the γth successor of κ, then γ is finite.

For any infinite sets A and B, if there is an injection from A to B then there is an injection from subsets of A to subsets of B. Thus for any infinite cardinals A and B, &lt;math&gt;A &lt; B \to 2^A \le 2^B.&lt;/math&gt; . If A and B are finite, the stronger inequality &lt;math&gt;A &lt; B \to 2^A &lt; 2^B &lt;/math&gt; holds. GCH implies that this strict, stronger inequality holds for infinite cardinals as well as finite cardinals.

===Implications of GCH for cardinal exponentiation===
Although the generalized continuum hypothesis refers directly only to cardinal exponentiation with 2 as the base, one can deduce from it the values of cardinal exponentiation &lt;math&gt;\aleph_{\alpha}^{\aleph_{\beta}}&lt;/math&gt; in all cases. GCH implies that (see: Hayden &amp; Kennison (1968), page 147, exercise 76):
:&lt;math&gt;\aleph_{\alpha}^{\aleph_{\beta}} = \aleph_{\beta+1}&lt;/math&gt; when ''α'' ≤ ''β''+1;
:&lt;math&gt;\aleph_{\alpha}^{\aleph_{\beta}} = \aleph_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; when ''β''+1 &lt; ''α'' and &lt;math&gt;\aleph_{\beta} &lt; \operatorname{cf} (\aleph_{\alpha})&lt;/math&gt;, where '''cf''' is the [[cofinality]] operation; and
:&lt;math&gt;\aleph_{\alpha}^{\aleph_{\beta}} = \aleph_{\alpha+1}&lt;/math&gt; when ''β''+1 &lt; ''α'' and &lt;math&gt;\aleph_{\beta} \ge \operatorname{cf} (\aleph_{\alpha})&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Democratic centralism''' is a democratic practice in which political decisions reached by voting processes are binding upon all members of the party.

== In practice ==

In party meetings, a motion (new policy or amendment, goal, plan or any other kind of political question) is proposed. After a period of debate, a vote is taken. If one vote clearly wins (gaining 60% or above share if two options for example) all participants (the party) are expected to follow that decision, and not continue propagandising or otherwise working against it, aiming to act in unity. If participants still disagree, instead of splitting and forming another party as in [[Representative Democracy]] they are expected to table a motion for discussing the issue again. In the development of socialism in Russia and China, it was largely taken up in response to dramatic developments and violence which required faster mechanisms of making decisions. A constellation of practices surround this in order to encourage participation and debate, such as Don't Blame the Speaker. &lt;ref name=criticism&gt;{{cite web|author=Mao Tse Tung|year=1944|url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/works/red-book/ch15.htm|title=Mao Tse Tung Quotations from Mao Tse Tung 15. Democracy in the Three Main Fields |accessdate=9 August 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vladimir Lenin's conception and practice ==
{{Leninism sidebar}}
The text ''[[What Is to Be Done?]]'' from 1902 is popularly seen as the founding text of democratic centralism. At this time, democratic centralism was generally viewed as a set of principles for the organizing of a revolutionary workers' party. However, [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s model for such a party, which he repeatedly discussed as being "democratic centralist", was the German [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]], inspired by remarks made by the social democrat [[Jean Baptista von Schweitzer]]. Lenin described democratic centralism as consisting of "freedom of discussion, unity of action".&lt;ref name=freedomunity&gt;{{cite web|author=Vladimir Lenin|year=1906|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1906/rucong/viii.htm|title=Report on the Unity Congress of the R.S.D.L.P.|accessdate=9 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The doctrine of democratic centralism served as one of the sources of the split between the [[Bolsheviks]] and the [[Mensheviks]]. The Mensheviks supported a looser [[party discipline]] within the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] in 1903 as did [[Leon Trotsky]], in ''[[Our Political Tasks]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1904/1904-pt/ |title=Our Political Tasks |author=Leon Trosky |year=1904 |accessdate=9 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311024421/http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1904/1904-pt/ |archivedate=11 March 2007 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Trotsky joined ranks with the Bolsheviks in 1917.

The Sixth Party Congress of the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party|Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party (Bolsheviks)]] held at [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]] between 26 July and 3 August 1917 defined democratic centralism as follows:
# That all directing bodies of the Party, from top to bottom, shall be elected.
# That Party bodies shall give periodical accounts of their activities to their respective Party organizations.
# That there shall be strict Party discipline and the subordination of the minority to the majority.
# That all decisions of higher bodies shall be absolutely binding on lower bodies and on all Party members.&lt;ref&gt;''History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks). Short Course'' (1939). New York. International Publishers. p.&amp;nbsp;198.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the successful consolidation of power by the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] following the [[October Revolution]] and the [[Russian Civil War]], the Bolshevik leadership, including Lenin, instituted a [[Ban on factions in the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|ban on factions in the party]] as Resolution No. 12 of the [[10th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|10th Party Congress]] in 1921. It was passed in the morning session on 16 March 1921.&lt;ref&gt;''Protokoly'' (1933). ed. 585–7; 1963 ed. 571–573.&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of Trotsky sometimes claim that this ban was intended to be temporary, but there is no language in the discussion at the 10th Party Congress suggesting such.&lt;ref&gt;''Protokoly'' (1933) ed. 523–548.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Group of Democratic Centralism]] was a group in the Soviet Communist Party who advocated different concepts of party democracy.

== Arguments for ==
In ''On Party Unity'', Lenin argued that democratic centralism prevents factionalism. He argued that factionalism leads to less friendly relations among members and that it can be exploited by enemies of the party.

By the [[History of the Soviet Union (1964–82)|Brezhnev period]], democratic centralism was described in the [[1977 Soviet Constitution]] as a principle for organizing the state: "The Soviet state is organized and functions on the principle of democratic centralism, namely the electiveness of all bodies of state authority from the lowest to the highest, their accountability to the people, and the obligation of lower bodies to observe the decisions of higher ones". Democratic centralism combines central leadership with local initiative and creative activity and with the responsibility of each state body and official for the work entrusted to them.

The democratic centralist principle extended to [[Soviet democracy#Elections in the Soviet Union|elections in the Soviet Union]]. All Communist countries were—either ''de jure'' or ''de facto''—[[one-party state]]s. In most cases, the voters were presented with a single list of unopposed candidates,&lt;ref name="Smith_1976"&gt;{{cite book |author=Hedrick Smith |year=1976 |title=The Russians |isbn=978-0-8129-0521-2 |publisher = [[Quadrangle Books|Quadrangle]]/[[New York Times Book Company]] |pages = 261, 286–287 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which usually won 90 percent or more of the vote.&lt;ref name="Smith_1976" /&gt; In some countries, those who voted against the lone candidate on the ballot could face serious reprisals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Victor Sebetsyen |title=Revolution 1989: The Fall of the Soviet Empire |publisher=Pantheon Books |location=New York City |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-375-42532-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}}&lt;ref name=DN&gt;Dieter Nohlen and Philip Stöver. ''Elections in Europe: A Data Handbook'' (2010). p.&amp;nbsp;457. {{ISBN|978-3-8329-5609-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== China ==
{{Politics of China}}
Democratic centralism is also stated in Article 3 of the [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China|present Constitution]] of the [[China|People's Republic of China]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;Article 3. The state organs of the People's Republic of China apply the principle of democratic centralism''.'' The National People's Congress and the local people's congresses at different levels are instituted through democratic election. They are responsible to the people and subject to their supervision. All administrative, judicial and procuratorial organs of the state are created by the people's congresses to which they are responsible and under whose supervision they operate. The division of functions and powers between the central and local state organs is guided by the principle of giving full play to the initiative and enthusiasm of the local authorities under the unified leadership of the central authorities.&lt;ref name="art3"&gt;English language text of [http://en.people.cn/constitution/constitution.html Constitution of the People's Republic of China] adopted 4 December 1982. Chapter 1. Article 3. Retrieved 29 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This idea is translated into the supremacy of the [[National People's Congress]], which represents China's citizens and exercises legislative authority on their behalf.  Other powers, including the power to appoint the head of state and head of government, are also vested in this body.

A field school is a short term [[academic program]] – usually taking part during the summer – designed to provide practical training for college students on subjects previously learned theoretically in classrooms.  Most field schools are four to eight weeks in length.  They are directed by academic faculty and students are awarded academic credit units and [[letter grade]] for their participation.  Programs are typically intensive and students and faculty work many hours each day together.  They frequently involve learning through conducting [[primary research]] in the field.  
Faculty to student ratio in field schools is usually kept very low.  They rarely exceed 1:20 and in many programs they are kept at 1:6.  The result is the creation of a genuine team learning experience and authentic [[mentoring]] of students.  Field schools are experiential programs where students learn primarily by doing.  Lectures, especially during the evenings, are mainstay for many field schools.

Some disciplines require field school participation as a condition for graduating with a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] or [[Bachelor of Science|BS]] degree.  [[Archaeology]], [[Geology]] and [[Paleontology]] are typically such disciplines although specific requirements differ from one university to the next. [[Graduate students]], especially those early in their graduate academic careers, may participate in field schools.  High school students or individuals associated with universities rarely attend as these are seen as highly academic training programs.

Data about field school attendance is not easily available (Boytner 2012;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boytner|first=Ran|title=The Changing Nature of Archaeological Field Schools|journal=The SAA Archaeological Record|year=2012|volume=1|series=12|pages=29–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mytum 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=editor|first=Harold Mytum,|title=Global perspectives on archaeological field schools : constructions of knowledge and experience|year=2012|publisher=Springer|location=New York, N.Y.|isbn=1461404320}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  [http://www.iie.org The Institute for International Education] – the organization that collects data about US students studying abroad through its annual [http://www.iie.org/Research-and-Publications/Open-Doors Open Doors Report] – does not designate students participating in field schools, or even research-based programs, as a category in its analysis.  It is unknown how many students participate in field school activities annually, whether within or outside the US.

Many field schools are run through universities, training their own students.  In recent years, field schools are emerging as significant revenue generating programs and universities are trying to attract students outside of those [[matriculating]] in their institution and charge hefty fees.  The [[economic crisis of 2008]] resulted with the removal of institutional subsidies for many field schools in the US and many field schools are now charging the full costs of the program.  Universities rarely monitor the quality of the field schools they offer as these are off campus, typically small in scale and effective monitoring requires significant investment of resources.  The result is that university based field schools are effectively unmonitored with significant gaps in quality.

In recent decades, independent and highly specialized academic organizations that run field schools independent of universities emerged.  Such organizations are dedicated operators of research-based field schools and use economies of scale to produce quality programs.  Students from any university may apply to such programs.  The School for Field Studies in ecology, Sea Semester in marine biology and the [[Institute for Field Research]] in archaeology are examples of such high end organizations.

Disciplines that typically require, or strongly encourage students to participate in a field school as part of the requirement for graduation includes:

# [[Archaeology]]
# [[Geology]]
# [[Paleontology]]
# [[Environmental Studies]]
# [[Primatology]]
# [[Marine Biology]]
# [[Anthropology]]
# [[Geography]]

In the US, an increasing number of students prefer to attend field schools abroad.  Combining travel, research and intensive learning environments is appealing to students who seek to maximize the use of their time and resources.  However, large number of students within the US and most students in countries elsewhere in the world attend field schools in relative proximity to their home campuses.

As universities offer increasing number of [[online classes]] and as the [[Massive open online course]] (MOOC’s) are becoming progressively popular, the need for an intensive, time-condensed yet quality field training programs surge.  Universities are moving to outsource such activities as they wish to minimized investment and exposure and are turning to organizations that can both guarantee quality of education and assume liability exposure.

[[File:Alfabet kaszubski 1850.jpeg|thumb|right|230px|The earlier Ceynowa's version of Kashubian alphabet, which dates back to 1850]]
'''Florian Ceynowa''' ([[Kashubian language|Kashubian]] ''Florión Cenôwa'') (May 4, 1817 – March 26, 1881) was a doctor, political activist, writer, and linguist. He undertook efforts to identify [[Kashubian language]], culture and traditions. He and [[Alexander Hilferding]] were not the only ones to study the language and legends of the [[Kashubians]], but they had the greatest influence and prompted others to take up investigations. The individual nature of the Kashubian character and language was first described by Hilferding, to whom we are indebted for the first data about the range of Kashubian dialects. In 1856, he and Ceynowa traveled to the [[Kashubia]]. He awakened Kashubian self-identity, thereby opposing Germanisation and Prussian authority, and Polish nobility and clergy. He believed in a separate Kashubian identity and strove for a Russian-led [[Pan-Slavism|pan-Slavic federation]]. He strove to create a program aimed at the introduction of a Kashubian standard in grammar, pronunciation and spelling, based on the spirit of the 1848 Revolution. He compiled treatises on Kashubian grammar, and published Kashubian texts along with their translations into other Slavic languages. An important person for [[Kashubian literature]], he was also a translator of [[Russian language|Russian]] texts into [[Kashubian language]].

Ceynowa was a pioneer of the nationalist movement among the [[Kashubians|Kashubian people]] in the mid-19th century. He was part of an attempt to take the Prussian garrison in Preußisch Stargard ([[Starogard Gdański]]) during 1846, but the operation failed when his 100 combatants, armed only with scythes, decided to abandon the site before the attack was carried out.

The '''Ground Nuts Order''' is a parody of United Kingdom [[Legalese]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Renton |first=Nick |url=http://nickrenton.com/329.htm |title=Plain English |accessdate=10 March 2014 |date=26 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140310224910/http://nickrenton.com/329.htm |archive-date=2014-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its full title is the "Nuts (unground), (other than ground nuts) Order".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lawyerment.com/facts/world_records/Judicial/ |website=lawyerment.com |title=Judicial World Records}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The alleged abstract of the act reads:

"In the Nuts (unground), (other than ground nuts) Order, the expression nuts shall have reference to such nuts, other than ground nuts, as would but for this amending Order not qualify as nuts (unground) (other than ground nuts) by reason of their being nuts (unground)".  However, no reference for this alleged act is ever cited in sources quoting the above abstract and it must be assumed to be a joke.

[[Ground nuts]] ([[peanut]]s) were introduced in the last days of the [[British Empire]] into [[Tanzania]] (then, [[Tanganyika]]) where they failed to grow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Eat the Rich (book)|Eat the Rich]]|last=O'Rourke|first=P. J.|authorlink=P. J. O'Rourke}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Ground Nuts Order" was created as a [[tariff]] or [[import tax]] to prevent the crop being sold at a loss.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

It is often used as an example of [[Gobbledegook]] or [[Legalese]].

[[File:1898-Cuba-Sheet-2c.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25| Top 30 stamps of an 1898 Cuban sheet showing a typical vertical ''gutter margin'' that divided the sheet into two panes of 50 stamps each.]]

The philatelic use of the word '''gutter''' is the space left between [[postage stamp]]s which allows them to be separated or perforated.&lt;ref name=Bennett&gt;Bennett, Russell and Watson, James; ''Philatelic Terms Illustrated'', Stanley Gibbons Publications, London (1978).&lt;/ref&gt; When stamps are printed on large sheets of [[postage stamp paper|paper]] that will be guillotined into smaller sheets along the gutter it will not exist on the finished sheet of stamps. Some sheets are specifically designed where two panes of stamps are separated by a gutter still in the finished sheet and gutters may, or may not, have some printing in the gutter. Since perforation of a particular width of stamps is normal, the gutter between the stamps is often the same size as the postage stamp.

Several derivative terms exist:

'''Gutter pairs''' are two stamps separated by a gutter.

'''Gutter block''' is a block of at least four stamps where either the vertical or horizontal pairs, or both, are separated by a gutter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mysticstamp.com/content.asp?contentID=10 Mystic Stamp: Stamp Collecting Questions and Answers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070421232119/http://mysticstamp.com/content.asp?contentID=10 |date=2007-04-21 }} (retrieved 22 March 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gutter margin''' is a margin dividing a sheet of stamps into separate panes.&lt;ref name=Bennett&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hjalmar Fredrik Elgérus Bergman''' (19 September 1883 in [[Örebro]], Sweden – 1 January 1931 in [[Berlin]], [[Weimar Republic|Germany]]) was a Swedish writer and playwright.

==Biography==
The son of a banker in [[Örebro]], Bergman briefly studied philosophy at [[Uppsala University]] but soon broke off his studies and took up the life of a free writer. He married [[Stina Bergman|Stina Lindberg]], the daughter of actor and stage producer [[August Lindberg (actor)|August Lindberg]] and [[Augusta Lindberg]], and sister of [[Per Lindberg]]. Up to his father's death in 1915 Bergman was heavily sponsored by the family patriarch; after the old man died from a stroke it turned out that the family business had become highly indebted and Bergman was forced to start making money out of his writing and court readers in a more outgoing and more entertaining manner. He rose to the challenge and in the following ten years reached the peak of his work.

Much of his output takes place in a small town in mid-Sweden, which is growing into a parallel universe in a Balzacian manner. The shameful secrets of a dozen of interwoven families gradually come out of the closet as the stories grow increasingly symbolic. A pessimistic outlook is always counterbalanced by a grotesque humour - indeed in a book like ''Markurells i Wadköping'' the latter almost succeeds in completely shading the former. The fictional town Wadköping is modelled on the author's hometown [[Örebro]]. When Örebro in 1965 opened its open-air museum featuring 19th century city life, it was named Wadköping.

After an unsuccessful bout as a manuscript writer in Hollywood Bergman's alcoholism and narcotics abuse took over, from which he died prematurely; his final novel ''Clownen Jac'' mirrors his awareness of his drift into self-destruction as well as his belief in the honesty and purpose of artistic spectacle.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15488">An '''interruption''' is a speech event when one person breaks in to interject while another person is talking. [[Linguistics|Linguists]], [[Social psychology|social psychologists]], [[anthropologist]]s, and [[Sociology|sociologists]] are among the [[Social science|social scientists]] who have studied and identified patterns of interruption that may differ by [[gender]], [[social status]], [[Race and ethnicity|race/ethnicity]], [[culture]], and [[political orientation]].

== Turn-taking and overlaps ==
[[Harvey Sacks]], the [[Sociology|sociologist]] who launched the field of [[conversation analysis]], worked with [[Linguistics|linguist]] [[Emanuel Schegloff]] and Gail Jefferson in the 1970s to analyze how [[turn-taking]] was organized in speech events such as everyday conversations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sacks|first=Harvey|last2=Schegloff|first2=Emanuel A.|last3=Jefferson|first3=Gail|date=1974|title=A Simplest Systematics for the Organization of Turn-Taking for Conversation|jstor=412243|journal=Language|volume=50|issue=4|pages=696–735|doi=10.2307/412243}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speech events are organized so that only one person speaks at a time and to provide for orderly ways to change speakers. Sacks et al. thought that the process of turn-taking is [[subconscious]].&lt;ref&gt;Cantrell, Lucy. 2013-14. "The Power of Rapport: An Analysis of the Effects of Interruptions and Overlaps in Casual Conversation." ''Innervate'' 6: 74-85. Accessed 03-11-18 at https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/english/documents/innervate/13-14/06-lucy-cantrell-q33103-pp-74-85.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Overlaps occur when two or more speakers talk simultaneously.

== Types of interruptions ==
Communication analyst Julia A. Goldberg uses [[conversation analysis]] to define three types of conversational interruptions. Relationally neutral interruptions are interjections by the listener that seek to repair, repeat, or clarify something the speaker just said. During this type of interruption, the interrupter does not intend to exert power over the speaker, or to establish rapport with the speaker. The act of interruption itself is understood as neutral in this instance. Another type of interruption defined by Goldberg is the power interruption, where the interrupter breaks in and cuts off the speaker as a way to display some social power. Power interruptions are understood as acts of conflict and competition, and are viewed as rude, hostile, disrespectful, and/or uncaring about the speaker and/or what the speaker is saying. A rapport interruption is designed to display mutuality and generally conveys the impression that the interrupter understands and empathizes with the speaker and/or the content of the speech, and is interpreted as collaborative and cooperative.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldberg|first=Julia A.|title=Interrupting the discourse on interruptions|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/0378-2166(90)90045-F|journal=Journal of Pragmatics|volume=14|issue=6|pages=883–903|doi=10.1016/0378-2166(90)90045-f}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Power interruptions are also analyzed by Zimmerman and West, sociologists who note that the people who seek to be socially dominant exert their power over others through interrupting their speech. This can be seen in interactions between whites and racial/ethnic [[Minority group|minorities]], and between adults and children. Zimmerman and West also analyzed how [[Sex Roles|sex roles]] shape interruption patterns.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Zimmerman, Don. H., and Candace West. 1996. "Sex Roles, Interruptions and Silences in Conversation." ''Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science'' 4: 211-236.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gender and interruption patterns ==
Since the late-1970s, social scientists have studied the effect gender has on interruption patterns and other components of verbal communication. The findings of these studies are mixed, with some finding gender differences, while others did not. Among those that found gender differences are sociologists Don Zimmerman and Candace West who used male dominance theory to claim that men interrupted women to assert their [[Social dominance theory|social dominance]] over females. Zimmerman and West's work discovered that interruptions were more evenly distributed in conversations involving same-sex speakers, while in cross-sex interactions, men were much more likely to interrupt women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=West|first=Candace|date=1979-06-01|title=Against Our Will: Male Interruptions of Females in Cross-Sex Conversation*|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1749-6632.1979.tb17755.x/abstract|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=327|issue=1|pages=81–96|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1979.tb17755.x|issn=1749-6632}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Zhao and Gantz analyzed fictional TV shows to claim that male characters used disruptive interruptions more than female characters, while female characters more often used cooperative interruptions. They note, however, that the apparent gender differences in interruption patterns are affected by differences in [[social status]] among the TV characters.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhao|first=Xiaoquan|last2=Gantz|first2=Walter|date=2003-06-01|title=Disruptive and Cooperative Interruptions in Prime-Time Television Fiction: The Role of Gender, Status, and Topic|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1460-2466.2003.tb02595.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Communication|language=en|volume=53|issue=2|pages=347–362|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2003.tb02595.x|issn=1460-2466}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldberg notes that when conversational context and content are analyzed, interruptions may be seen as power displays, rapport displays, or as neutral acts that may or may not be shaped by the gender of the speaker.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Linguist Makri-Tsilipakou discovered that men and women use "simultaneous speech" at about the same rate, but the sexes differ as to their interpretation of the meaning of the interruption. Women use simultaneous speech as a sign of support and agreement, while men use it either as support for the other's speech or to dissent from other speakers or from their viewpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1994-04-01|title=Interruption revisited: Affiliative vs. disaffiliative intervention|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0378216694900124|journal=Journal of Pragmatics|language=en|volume=21|issue=4|pages=401–426|doi=10.1016/0378-2166(94)90012-4|issn=0378-2166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drass, a social psychologist, found that [[gender identity]], as separate from biological sex, was an important variable, with persons who were more male-identified being more likely to interrupt than persons who were more female-identified.

Conversely, a study by Murray and Covelli used Zimmerman and West's coding strategies on their own dataset of conversations to find that women interrupted men more often than men interrupted women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Murray|first=Stephen O.|last2=Covelli|first2=Lucille H.|title=Women and men speaking at the same time|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/0378-2166(88)90022-7|journal=Journal of Pragmatics|volume=12|issue=1|pages=103–111|doi=10.1016/0378-2166(88)90022-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to James and Clarke, this pattern is especially evident in conversational situations where women felt more expertise, and thus may have felt that their interruptions were more legitimate.&lt;ref&gt;James, Deborah, and Sandra Clarke. 1993. Pp. 231-280 in ''Gender and conversational analysis.'' Edited by Deborah Tannen. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Manterrupting ===
The term, [[:de:Manterruption|manterrupting]], was coined in early 2015 by Jessica Bennett in an article that appeared in ''Time.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/3666135/sheryl-sandberg-talking-while-female-manterruptions/|title=How Not to Be 'Manterrupted' in Meetings|website=Time|language=en|access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bennett defines the term as "[u]nnecessary interruption of a woman by a man." During the 2016 [[United States presidential debates|American presidential debates]], the term was applied to candidate [[Donald Trump]] who interrupted [[Hillary Clinton]] dozens of times during the first and second debates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/money/4524162/donald-trump-manterruption-presidential-debate/|title=Donald Trump's Manterruptions Continue Uninterrupted at Second Presidential Debate|website=Money|language=en|access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its introduction, the term has gained a significant presence on the internet as experts offer advice on how to avoid manterrupting and as [[Feminism|feminist]] and [[Postfeminism|postfeminist]] [[Blog|bloggers]] and commentators debate its applicability.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} In 2017, [http://www.womaninterruptedapp.com/en/ Woman Interrupted], an app to track the [[gender]] of conversational partners was introduced. The app, which is free, is designed to assist men and women in recognizing and addressing manterrupting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/this-app-wants-to-help-women-track-how-often-theyre-manterrupted_us_58bec18de4b09ab537d6bee9|title=This App Wants To Help Women Track How Often They're 'Manterrupted'|last=Hatch|first=Jenavieve|date=2017-03-07|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2018-03-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Status and interruption patterns ==
Interruptions work as a status-organizing cue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Farley|first=Sally D.|last2=Ashcraft|first2=Amie M.|last3=Stasson|first3=Mark F.|last4=Nusbaum|first4=Rebecca L.|date=2010-12-01|title=Nonverbal Reactions to Conversational Interruption: A Test of Complementarity Theory and the Status/Gender Parallel|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10919-010-0091-0|journal=Journal of Nonverbal Behavior|language=en|volume=34|issue=4|pages=193–206|doi=10.1007/s10919-010-0091-0|issn=0191-5886}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, conversational participants use cues such as perceptions of [[Prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige]], power, [[Social class|social class,]] gender, [[Race (human categorization)|race]] and age, to organize [[Communication in small groups|small group]] [[Hierarchy|hierarchies]]. Interruption patterns differ by social status, with persons of higher [[social status]], such as belonging to a social group who has more prestige or power, interrupting persons with lower status.&lt;ref name="Kollock 1985 34–46"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kollock|first=Peter|last2=Blumstein|first2=Philip|last3=Schwartz|first3=Pepper|date=1985|title=Sex and Power in Interaction: Conversational Privileges and Duties|jstor=2095338|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=50|issue=1|pages=34–46|doi=10.2307/2095338}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jacobi and Schweers analyzed transcripts of oral arguments made before the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] to find that senior justices interrupted their junior colleagues more frequently than the reverse.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jacobi|first=Tonja|last2=Schweers|first2=Dylan|date=2017-10-24|title=Justice, Interrupted: The Effect of Gender, Ideology and Seniority at Supreme Court Oral Arguments|ssrn=2933016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kollock et al. studied conversations among couples, including male couples, female couples, and mixed sex couples. They found that partners who were considered to have more social power interrupted their partners more often, regardless of the gender composition of the dyad.&lt;ref name="Kollock 1985 34–46"/&gt; In TV shows, characters who are lower in the status hierarchy are scripted to display a "sense of defiance" that allows them to interrupt more aggressively than persons who hold a mid-level status.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A study of interviews between physicians and patients found that physicians, who are considered to hold higher status than their patients in terms of prestige, are much more likely to interrupt their patients, regardless of the sex of the patient or the physician. Patients interrupted senior physicians at a higher rate than they interrupted doctors who were in training, indicating that the senior physicians are regarded as having a higher status than the their junior colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;Menz, Florian, and Ali Al-Roubaie. 2008. "Interruptions, status and gender in medical interviews: the harder you brake, the longer it takes." ''Discourse &amp; Society'' 19(5): 645-666.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, a study of physician-patient interactions among six different statuses, from low to high, indicated that patients tended to interrupt physicians more than the reverse, and that high and low status physicians did not differ in the number of times that they interrupted their patients. This study, by Irish and Hall, noted that status thus appears to be less of an indicator of the likelihood of interruptions among physicians and patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Irish|first=J. T.|last2=Hall|first2=J. A.|date=September 1995|title=Interruptive patterns in medical visits: the effects of role, status and gender|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|volume=41|issue=6|pages=873–881|issn=0277-9536|pmid=8571159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to social status affecting interruption patterns, interruptions also affect social status. In a study of mixed-sex and same-sex [[Dyad (sociology)|dyads]], Farley discovered that the interrupters gained social status after they interrupted, while those who were interrupted lost social status. This study also found that people who interrupted also lost in terms of likeability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Farley|first=Sally D.|date=2008-12-01|title=Attaining Status at the Expense of Likeability: Pilfering Power Through Conversational Interruption|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10919-008-0054-x|journal=Journal of Nonverbal Behavior|language=en|volume=32|issue=4|pages=241–260|doi=10.1007/s10919-008-0054-x|issn=0191-5886}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Race/ethnicity and interruption patterns ==
Zimmerman and West note that whites interrupt blacks as a strategy to exert their power and dominance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Cultural differences ==
Interruptions, and how people interpret interruptions, differ by [[culture]] and [[language]]. Makri-Tsilpakou notes that some languages and cultures have higher tolerance for simultaneous talk, and that interpretations of interruptions may differ depending on cultural context.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118611463.wbielsi088/abstract|title=The International Encyclopedia of Language and Social Interaction|last=Makri-Tsilipakou|first=Marianthi|date=2015|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|isbn=9781118611463|language=en|doi=10.1002/9781118611463.wbielsi088}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political orientation ==
Political [[Political spectrum|orientation]], e.g. where a person falls on the [[Conservatism|conservative]] to [[Liberalism|liberal]] political continuum, also shapes the likelihood that people will interrupt others or will be interrupted themselves. Jacobi and Schweers, in their study of transcripts of oral arguments made before the U.S. Supreme Court, found that conservative justices and advocates interrupt more often than liberals.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1668">[[File:Kilowaar.png|thumb|Dutch kiloware]]
'''Kiloware''' is a term for packages of [[postage stamp]]s sold to [[stamp collecting|stamp collectors]] by weight rather than by quantity, often in kilograms, hence the name.  Kiloware usually consists of used stamps on [[postage stamp paper|paper]] from mail clippings, although off paper stamps may also be sold as kiloware.

'''Mission kiloware''', or '''mission mixtures''', are kiloware produced by charitable organizations, churches, etc., whose volunteers gather used stamps and then sell them to dealers.  Mission kiloware will normally have high duplication of common letter rate [[definitive stamp|definitives]], but good mission kiloware will be advertised as "unpicked", meaning the scarcer or better stamps will not have been removed from the mix, and there is at least the possibility of the collector finding good stamps for a low price.

The stamp newspaper ''[[Linn's Stamp News]]'' has a regular feature entitled "Kitchen Table Philately", in which the reviewer buys mixtures from various dealers, and analyzes what is in the mixtures, noting percentage of duplicates, oldest and newest stamps, better stamps, and concluding with a computation of the cost-to-value ratio. Typical numbers are in the 5% percent range, meaning that the stamps cost a small fraction of their price when sold individually by dealers.

The [[SIL Ethnologue]] lists 415 living languages for India.

==Overview==
India has 23 constitutionally recognized [[Languages with official status in India|official languages]]. [[Hindi]] and [[Indian English|English]] are typically used as an official language by the [[Government of India|Central Government]].

== List of mother tongues by number of speakers ==
Each of the ''languages'' of the 2001 census subsumes one or more ''mother tongues''. Speaker numbers are available for these mother tongues and they are also included in the speaker numbers for their respective language.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4866">The '''"Appeal to womanhood throughout the world"'''&lt;ref name="appeal"/&gt; (later known as '''"Mother's Day Proclamation"''') by [[Julia Ward Howe]] was an appeal for women to unite for peace in the world. Written in 1870, Howe's "Appeal to womanhood" was a pacifist reaction to the carnage of the [[American Civil War]] and the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. The appeal was tied to Howe's [[feminist]] conviction that women had a responsibility to shape their societies at the political level.

In 1872 Howe asked for the celebration of a "Mother's Day for Peace" on 2 June of every year, but she was unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="leigh"&gt;{{cite book | title = Consumer Rites: The Buying and Selling of American Holidays | author = LEIGH Eric Schmidt | edition = reprint, illustrated | editor = [[Princeton University Press]] | year = 1997 | pages = 252, 348 (footnote 17 of chapter 5) | isbn = 978-0-691-01721-1 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=maF8mTPsJqsC }} citing Deborah Pickman Clifford, ''Mine Eyes Have Seen the Glory: A Biography of Julia Ward Howe (Boston: Little, Brown, 1979), 187, 207, and Julia Ward Howe, "How the Fourth of July Should Be Celebrated", ''Forum'' 15 (July 1983); 574&lt;/ref&gt; The modern [[Mother's Day]] is an unrelated celebration and it was established by [[Anna Jarvis]] years later.&lt;ref name="leigh"/&gt;

Today, the appeal is included in the [[Unitarian Universalist]] hymnal ''[[Singing the Living Tradition]]''.

==Appeal to womanhood throughout the world==
{{quote|1=Again, in the sight of the Christian world, have the skill and power of two great nations exhausted themselves in mutual murder. Again have the sacred questions of international justice been committed to the fatal mediation of military weapons. In this day of progress, in this century of light, the ambition of rulers has been allowed to barter the dear interests of domestic life for the bloody exchanges of the battle field. Thus men have done. Thus men will do. But women need no longer be made a party to proceedings which fill the globe with grief and horror. Despite the assumptions of physical force, the mother has a sacred and commanding word to say to the sons who owe their life to her suffering. That word should now be heard, and answered to as never before.

Arise, then, Christian women of this day ! Arise, all women who have hearts, Whether your baptism be that of water or of tears ! Say firmly : We will not have great questions decided by irrelevant agencies. Our husbands shall not come to us, reeking with carnage, for caresses and applause. Our sons shall not be taken from us to unlearn all that we have been able to teach them of charity, mercy and patience. We, women of one country, will be too tender of those of another country, to allow our sons to be trained to injure theirs. From the bosom of the devastated earth a voice goes up with our own. It says: Disarm, disarm! The sword of murder is not the balance of justice. Blood does not wipe out dishonor, nor violence vindicate possession. As men have often forsaken the plough and the anvil at the summons of war, let women now leave all that may be left of home for a great and earnest day of council.

Let them meet first, as women, to bewail and commemorate the dead. Let them then solemnly take council with each other as to the means whereby the great human family can live in peace, man as the brother of man, each bearing after his own kind the sacred impress, not of Caesar, but of God.

In the name of womanhood and of humanity, I earnestly ask that a general congress of women, without limit of nationality, may be appointed and held at some place deemed most convenient, and at the earliest period consistent with its objects, to promote the alliance of the different nationalities, the amicable settlement of international questions, the great and general interests of peace.|2=Julia Ward Howe&lt;ref name="appeal"&gt;{{citation |title= Appeal to womanhood throughout the world |publisher= Library of Congress |author= Julia Ward Howe |date= September 1870 |work= An American Time Capsule: Three Centuries of Broadsides and Other Printed Ephemera |url= http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/h?ammem/rbpebib:@field(NUMBER+@band(rbpe+07400300))}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howe, Julia Ward.

'''Narmadashankar Lalshankar Dave''' (24 August 1833 – 26 February 1886), popularly known as '''Narmad''', was a [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] poet, playwright, essayist, orator, lexicographer and reformer under the [[British Raj]]. He is considered to be the founder of modern [[Gujarati literature]].&lt;ref name="GSP"/&gt; After studying in Bombay, he stopped serving as a teacher to live by writing. During his prolific career, he introduced many literary forms in Gujarati. He faced economic struggles but proved himself as a dedicated reformer, speaking loudly against religious and social orthodoxy. His essays, poems, plays and prose were published in several collections. His ''[[Mari Hakikat]]'', the first autobiography in Gujarati,{{efn-ua|In the 1840s, Durgaram Mehta had written his personal diary , ''Nityanondh'' but it was not an attempt of autobiography as in western style.

==Career==
[[File:Saraswati Mandir 1933.png|thumb|left|[[Saraswati Mandir]] was built by Narmad in 1866. Image taken in 1933. Now restored.]]
He was appointed as a teacher at the school of [[Rander]] on 1 May 1851. He again recited his early essay in ''Swadesh Hitechchhu Mandali'' and started ''Gyansagar'' magazine in July 1851. He was transferred to a school in Nanpara in March 1853. After the death of his wife Gulab, he left this position and went to Bombay, in January 1854. He returned to college on the suggestion of his friend Jhaverilal Umiyashankar and joined Buddhivardhak Sabha, a literary group in June 1854. He started learning ''[[Bhaṭṭoji Dīkṣita#Siddhānta Kaumudī|Siddhant Kaumudi]]''. 

He became interested in poetry and started writing in September 1855, studying literary [[metre (poetry)|metre]] over the following year. He presided over ''Buddhivardhak Granth'' from March to December 1856.&lt;ref name="Dave1983" /&gt; After his second marriage, he left college in August 1856, writing ''Pingal Pravesh'' in February 1857 and dedicating it to his father. He joined Gokuldas Tejpal Vidyalaya as a teacher and began studying Sanskrit literary works such as ''[[Laghu kaumudi]]'', ''Chandralok'', ''Nrisimhachampu'', ''Kavyachampu'', ''Prataprudra'', ''[[Adhyatma Ramayana]]''. He started at Central School as a teacher in February 1858, then resigned in November 1858 after deciding to pursue a literary career.&lt;ref name="GSP" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dave1983" /&gt;

He studied Sanskrit grammar and poetry in [[Pune]] from November 1858 to March 1859. Deciding to study independently he returned to Bombay in March, where he met [[Dalpatram]], a reformist Gujarati poet, in June 1859, and became involved in reform activities.

His wife Dahigauri returned to her parents' home. In 1860, he had discussed [[widow remarriage]] with religious leader Jadunathji Maharaj, which led to him becoming involved with the ''[[Maharaj Libel Case]]'' the next year.&lt;ref name="Patel1995"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Patel|editor-first=Sujata|last=Mallison|first=Françoise|title=Bombay: Mosaic of Modern Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2ZJPAAAAMAAJ|chapter=Bomaby as the Intellectual Capital of the Gujaratis in the Nineteenth Century|year=1995|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-0-19-563689-5|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SumanShah2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shah|first=Suman|author-link=Suman Shah|title=અનુ-આધુનિકતાવાદ અને આપણે|language=gu|trans-title=The Articles on Post-Modernism|chapter=Resistance through Self-Correction|year=2008|edition=1st|publisher=Parshva Publication|location=Ahmedabad|page=251}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was filed by Jadunathji against writer [[Karsandas Mulji]] after the journalist published an article alleging sexual exploitation of women in his religious sect. 

He visited Income Tax Commissioner Curtis regarding a surcharge on 3 February 1863. With the help of friends, he started a biweekly newsletter called ''Dandiyo'' ({{abbr|lit.|literally}} A drum stick), modeled after British weekly ''[[The Spectator]],'' in September 1864. It was loudly reformist in its stand and attacked traditional customs of Hindu society.&lt;ref name="Desai2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Meghnad Desai|title=The Rediscovery of India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xVh-b6Aa_BIC&amp;pg=PT229|date=2 August 2011|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=978-81-8475-566-4|pages=229–}}&lt;/ref&gt; It ran until 1869 when it was merged with ''The Sunday Review''.{{efn-ua|''The Sunday Review'' was also closed after some time.

He moved back to Surat in July 1865 and sheltered Savitagauri, a widow, in a neighbouring house. He published ''[[Narmagadya]]'' in September 1865. He was banished from his caste due to reform activities on 18 August but reinstated on 21 November 1866. The same year, he wrote his autobiographical work, ''Mari Hakikat'', the first autobiography in Gujarati. He published ''Nayikavishaypravesh'' and ''Uttam Nayika'' dedicated to his then separated wife, Dahigauri. In early 1867, he published ''Narmakavita'', a poetry collection. He had debts of 10,000 that caused him great concern. He married again in 1869. He published summaries of ''[[Ramayana]]'', ''[[Mahabharata]]'' and ''[[Iliad]]'' in 1870. He published the school version of ''Narmagadya'' in 1874 and the edition for the government in 1875.&lt;ref name="Dave1983" /&gt;

He moved back again to Bombay in March 1875, where he met [[Dayanand Saraswati]], a reformist and founder of [[Arya Samaj]], and started to become deeply religious. He published the first dictionary of Gujarati language in March 1876.&lt;ref name="Dave1983" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mumbai Samachar"&gt;{{cite web | title=‘ડાંડિયા’, ‘નર્મકોશ’ અને જય જય ગરવી ગુજરાત |author=Saurabh Shah | website=Mumbai Samachar | url=http://www.bombaysamachar.com/frmStoryShow.aspx?sNo=89514 | language=gu | accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He founded Vedsarasvati in ''Sarasvatimandir'' of Surat on 16 April 1877.

Aryanitidarshak Mandali performed his play ''Draupadi-Darshan'' in 1878. By 1880 he had become fully "believer" and performed [[Upanayana]] for his son that year. He wrote a play, ''Shri Sarshakuntal'' in 1881 which was performed. He published a translation of ''[[Bhagvad Gita]]'' in 1882. Although unhappy about breaking a resolve not to work for other people, he was forced due to financial difficulties into taking a position as a secretary to Gokuldas Tejpal Dharmakhata. He wrote a play, ''Shri Balkrishnavijay'' in 1883. 

His health failing due to the stress of work starting a hostel, he left his job on 19 July 1885. After a prolonged eight month illness, he died of [[arthritis]] on 26 February 1886 in Bombay.&lt;ref name="Dave1983"/&gt;&lt;ref name=poemhunter&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography of Narmadashankar Dave|url=http://www.poemhunter.com/narmadashankar-dave/biography/|publisher=poemhunter.com|accessdate=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kamat&gt;{{cite web|title=Poet Narmad|url=http://www.kamat.com/database/biographies/narmad.htm|publisher=kamat.com|accessdate=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sangeetbhavantrust&gt;{{cite web|title=Narmad, Gujarati Saraswats, Sangeet Bhavan|url=http://sangeetbhavantrust.com/narmad.html|publisher=sangeetbhavantrust.com|accessdate=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=indianmirror&gt;{{cite web|title=Gujarati Language, History of Gujarati Language|url=http://www.indianmirror.com/languages/gujarati-language.html|publisher=indianmirror.com|accessdate=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Datta1987"&gt;{{cite book|author=Amaresh Datta|title=Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature: A-Devo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ObFCT5_taSgC&amp;pg=PA909|year=1987|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|isbn=978-81-260-1803-1|pages=909–910}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
{{main article|Works of Narmadashankar Dave}}
Narmad is considered to be the founder of modern [[Gujarati literature]]. He introduced many creative forms of writing to the [[Gujarati language]], including pioneering works in [[autobiography]], [[poetry]], [[lexicography]], historical plays and folk literature research. He was an outspoken journalist and pamphleteer. Narmad was a strong opponent of [[religious fanaticism]] and [[orthodoxy]]. He promoted [[nationalism]] and [[patriotism]] with famous songs such as ''Sahu Chalo Jeetva Jang,'' wrote about [[self-government]] and discussed having one national language, [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]], for all of India, nearly five decades before [[Mahatma Gandhi]] or [[Jawaharlal Nehru|Nehru]]. His poem ''[[Jai Jai Garavi Gujarat (Poem)|Jai Jai Garavi Gujarat]]'', written in the preface of ''[[Narmakosh]]'', listed with a sense of pride all the cultural symbols that go into constituting the Gujarati identity. These symbols included things non-Hindu, implying that Gujarat belongs to all the castes, communities, races, religions and sects that live together there. The poem is now ''[[de facto]]'' state song of Gujarat. Mahatma Gandhi acknowledged him for his philosophy of nonviolence.&lt;ref name="Mumbai Samachar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="poemhunter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kamat"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sangeetbhavantrust"/&gt;&lt;ref name="indianmirror"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Datta1987"/&gt;

His poem, "[[Jai Jai Garavi Gujarat]]" (1873), is used as a de facto state song for [[Gujarat]].&lt;ref name="toi2010"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Bharat Yagnik |author2=Ashish Vashi|title=No Gujarati dept in Veer Narmad, Hemchandracharya varsities |website=[[The Times of India]] | date=2 July 2010 | url=http://epaper.timesofindia.com/Default/Layout/Includes/TOI/ArtWin.asp?From=Archive&amp;Source=Page&amp;Skin=TOI&amp;BaseHref=TOIA%2F2010%2F07%2F02&amp;ViewMode=HTML&amp;PageLabel=5&amp;EntityId=Ar00503&amp;AppName=1 | accessdate=13 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
He married Gulab, daughter of Surajram Shastri of [[Sadr Diwani Adalat|Sudder Court]], Surat, on 29 April 1844. She gave a birth to girl in 1852 who died 15 days later. Gulab herself died on 5 October 1853 following a [[stillbirth]]. In May 1856, he married Dahigauri, daughter of Tripuranand Shastri; she separated from him in 1860. He married Subhadra (later Narmadagauri), a widow of his caste, in 1869, breaking the customary taboo against [[widow remarriage]]. She gave birth to their son Jayshankar in 1870. He worked as a clerk for [[Bombay Municipal Corporation|Bombay Municipality]], and never married, dying on 31 March 1910 of the [[Plague (disease)|plague]].&lt;ref name="Dave1983"/&gt;

==Contest with Dalpatram==
Just at the time when Narmad was emerging into celebrity (1859), Dalpatram who had already won his laurels, happened to visit Bombay for treatment of his eyes. Lovers of Gujarati poetry, they met together, and in the poetical contest that took place, naturally they warmed up and their audience took sides as to who was the better poet. The result was a lifelong estrangement between the two. The contest was continued in the public papers and a humorous paper. The ''Parsi Punch'', a weekly, published a cartoon, in which they were represented as fighting each other with the top-knot of the hair of their heads in their hands.&lt;ref name="Jhaveri1956"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jhaveri|first=Krishnalal Mohanlal |author-link=Krishnalal Jhaveri |title=Further milestones in Gujarāti literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rqxHAAAAMAAJ|year=1956|edition=2nd|publisher=Forbes Gujarati Sabha|location=Mumbai|pages=54–55}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Northern Pashto''' or '''Northeastern Pashto''',&lt;ref&gt;Prods Oktor Skjærvø, P.O. 1989. Pashto. In "Compendium Linguarum Iranicarum", R. Schmitt (ed.), 384-410.&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes known as '''Yusufzai''' Pashto after its principal subdialect, is a Northern dialect of Pashto spoken in northern Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province of [[Pakistan]] and northeastern Afghanistan.

==Phonology==
Yusufzai Pashto has a difference in affricates: in other dialects t͡s, d͡z/z, ʒ, in Peshawari instead s, z, j. Such as in most Northern dialects, in Yusufzai is pronounced x and g instead southern ʂ, ʐ.

'''Padonkaffsky jargon''' ({{lang-ru|язык падонкафф}}, ''yazyk padonkaff'') or '''Olbanian''' ({{lang|ru|олбанский}}, ''olbanskiy'') is a [[Cant (language)|cant]] language developed by a subculture of [[Runet]] called '''padonki''' ({{lang-ru|падонки}}). It started as an [[Internet slang]] language originally used in the Russian [[Internet]] community. It is comparable to the [[English language|English]]-based [[Leet]]. Padonkaffsky jargon became so popular that the former [[President of Russia]] [[Dmitry Medvedev]] jokingly suggested that Olbanian be taught in schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kremlin Favorite Campaigns as Putin's Alter Ego |url=https://www.usrbc.org/resources/russiannews/event/1192 |date=29 January 2008 |newspaper=U.S.-Russia Business Council |accessdate=20 November 2014 |agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin and etymology ==
The term ''Olbanian'' is an alteration of [[Albanian language|Albanian]], although Albanian is not used to create Olbanian slang.

'''Learn Olbanian!''' (''Russian'': Учи олбанский!) is a popular phrase that was coined in a 2004 incident in [[LiveJournal]] when an [[English language]] user found a post written in Russian, which he didn't understand and was unable to translate. He asked what language was being used. He was jokingly told that the post was in Albanian. He questioned why people were posting messages in Albanian by saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Because? It's LIVEJOURNAL. An American website. Not an albanian; (#*!@()! site.

Plus, being an American means that the rest of the world should have to cater to me. But that's just mypointofview.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In reaction to this comment, an [[Internet meme]] started, urging the English language user to ''Learn Albanian!'' and flooding him with email messages, text messages, and calls to his personal cell phone. Eventually, the English language user wrote an apology in Russian, explaining that he had mastered the Albanian language.

Since then, the request to "Learn Olbanian!" became a friendly response to anyone using incorrect grammar or when saying something that doesn't make sense.

An invitation to  "Learn Olbanian!" was directed at [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] in 2006, when in her blog she used an electronic translator to address her Russian fans and called them "Russian ventilators" by mistake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Мадонна поблагодарила русских вентиляторов |trans-title=Madonna thanked Russian ventilators |language=Russian |date=13 September 2006 |accessdate=20 November 2014 |newspaper=Lenta.ru |url=http://lenta.ru/news/2006/09/13/madonna/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use and development==
The language was first developed in 1997 by [[intellectuals]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  |url=http://metro74.ru/content/19-02-2010/uchi-olbanskiy |title=Учи олбанский! |trans-title=Learn Olbanian! |date=19 February 2010 |newspaper=Metro74 |accessdate=20 November 2014 |first=Nataliya |last=Fedorova |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Internet access]] who were developing and using [[open-source software]] [[LiveJournal]] and Russian [[FidoNet]]. They were [[journalists]], [[system administrators]] and professionals with [[academic degrees]].

The language is based on [[sensational spelling|sensational]] (mostly [[phonetic spelling|phonetic]], but also counterphonetic) spelling of the [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] languages often using [[profanity]]. It combines complex [[orthography]] with creative use of [[idioms]] and literary expression. It is often used to express disagreement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= How the internet is changing language|author= Kleinman, Zoe |newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=16 August 2010|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-10971949|accessdate=16 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; amusement, or to create [[political satire]]. It was popularized by the padonki subculture on websites like [[Udaff.com]] and Fuck.ru (currently defunct) created by entrepreneur [[Egor Lavrov]] and [[Konstantin Rykov]], now a deputy of the [[Duma]].

Padonkaffsky [[jargon]] is difficult to translate with a traditional [[dictionary]] because many of the misspellings also involve [[pun|puns]] and cultural slang. Padonkaffsky language has gone [[mainstream]] and is common in Russian [[vernacular]] and [[popular culture]]. As a result, the websites on which Padonkaffsky language originally appeared are now dominated by another kind of high-shock-value material, [[adult content]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=National Identity in Russia from 1961 : Traditions and Deterritorialisation |title=Newsletter |volume=1 |date=June 2008 |first=Albert |last=Baiburin |url=http://www.mod-langs.ox.ac.uk/russian/nationalism/newsletter-no1.doc |format=DOC |accessdate=20 November 2014 |via=[http://www.mod-langs.ox.ac.uk/russian/nationalism/newsletter.htm mod-langs.ox.ac.uk]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rules ==
The unstressed letter {{angbr|[[O (Cyrillic)|о]]}} is replaced by {{angbr|[[а]]}}, and sometimes the other way around. The unstressed letters {{angbr|[[Ye (Cyrillic)|е]]}}, {{angbr|[[I (Cyrillic)|и]]}}, and {{angbr|[[Ya (Cyrillic)|я]]}} are also interchangeable. The consonant {{angbr|[[Ve (Cyrillic)|в]]}} may become {{angbr|[[Ef (Cyrillic)|ф]]}} or {{angbr|фф}}, the suffix {{angbr|-ик}} becomes {{angbr|-ег}}, {{angbr|жи}} becomes {{angbr|жы}}, {{angbr|я}} becomes {{angbr|йа}}, etc.{{cn|date=May 2018}} Examples: превед ([[PREVED]], from привет ''privet'' 'hi!'), аффтар ''afftar'' (from автор ''avtor'' 'author'), йад (from яд ''yad'' 'poison'), etc.

== Notable examples ==
* On July 6, 2006 in an online conference, [[Vladimir Putin]] was asked this question: ''"[[PREVED]], Vladimir Vladimirovich! How do you regard [[Bear Surprise|MEDVED]]?"'' This became the most popular question, with 28424 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://president.yandex.ru/question.xml?id=155546 |title=Yandex. Questions to Vladimir Putin |date=2006-07-01 |publisher=[[Yandex]] |language=Russian |accessdate=2008-11-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071231152135/http://president.yandex.ru/question.xml?id=155546 |archivedate=December 31, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; No answer was given, but the [[Associated Press]], reporting on the questions collection process, interpreted Medved as a reference to then-vice-prime-minister [[Dmitry Medvedev]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://lenta.ru/news/2006/07/07/medved/|date = 2006-07-07|title=Дмитрия Медведева перепутали с Медведом |trans-title=Dmitry Medvedev got confused with a bear |newspaper=[[Lenta.Ru]] |language=Russian |accessdate=2008-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another popular question in the same conference was: [[How does one patch KDE2 under FreeBSD?]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8416">'''Panglima''' is a military title used in Malay nations (e.g. Indonesia, Malaysia). It means 'a commander of a body of troops'.&lt;ref&gt;Poerwadarminta, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; In the past it is used to call some prominent military leaders in several kingdoms, such as [[Panglima Polem]] from [[Aceh]]. In modern times it is reserved for the chiefs of the armed forces of [[Indonesian National Armed Forces|Indonesia]] and [[Malaysian Armed Forces|Malaysia]] and some other posts.

==Use in Indonesia==

===Panglima Tertinggi Angkatan Bersenjata Republik Indonesia===
[[File:Soekarno.jpg|thumb|[[Sukarno]], ''Presiden Republik Indonesia, Panglima Tertinggi Angkatan Bersenjata Republik Indonesia, Pemimpin Besar Revolusi, Mandataris MPRS'' ([[President of the Republic of Indonesia]], Supreme Commander of the [[Indonesian National Armed Forces|Armed Forces of Indonesia]], Great Leader of the Revolution, Mandatary of [[People's Consultative Assembly|Provisional People's Colsultative Assembly]])|left|upright=0.75]]

Per [[Indonesian Constitution]] the [[President of Indonesia]] is the Supreme Commander of Indonesian Armed Forces ('''''Panglima Tertinggi Angkatan Bersenjata Republik Indonesia'''''). Essentially it is parallel to the title 'Commander-in-Chief' in other countries, ''e.g.'' the United States.

During the [[Guided Democracy in Indonesia|Old Order]] era, this title is included into many honorific titles that were often mentioned each time [[Sukarno]]'s name was written or read in speeches, edicts, or news.

===Panglima TNI===
In [[Indonesian National Armed Forces ]] the highest position overseeing the three branches - Army, Navy, Air Force - is called '''''Panglima Tentara National Indonesia''''' ('[[Commander of the Indonesian National Armed Forces]]'). Before the separation of the [[Indonesian National Police|National Police]] from the Armed forces in 2000, the Armed Forces consisted of four branches. The Armed Forces were named Angkatan Bersenjata Republik Indonesia, which comprised TNI and the Police. The commander of the Armed Forces was called ''Panglima ABRI'' accordingly, or usually known with the acronym '''''Pangab'''''.

According to [[Indonesian Constitution|the revised Constitution]] ''Panglima TNI'' is appointed by the [[President of Indonesia|President]] after confirmed by [[People's Representative Council|DPR]]. Before the Constitution was amended in 2002, the President had the prerogative right to appoint or dismiss the 'Panglima' at his pleasure.

===Panglima Besar===
[[File:Sudirman in Jakarta (1946).jpg|thumb|alt=A man descending from a train in the midst of a crowd of reporters|''Panglima Besar'' General [[Sudirman]] (center), the first Commander of Indonesian National Armed Forces, arriving in Jakarta on 1 November 1946]]

The honorific title '''''Panglima Besar''''', meaning 'Grand Commander' was bestowed informally upon [[Sudirman]], the first Commander of the [[Indonesian National Armed Forces|Armed Forces]] and legendary leader of guerilla war during [[Indonesian National Revolution]] (1945–1949).

===Other Military Use===

Beside the use for 'Panglima TNI', the title 'Panglima' is also used for many formations within the Armed Forces.

[[File:Suharto as the commander of Kostrad.jpg|256px|left|thumb|Major General [[Suharto]] in his office as ''Panglima Kostrad'', (Commander of the [[Kostrad|Strategic Reserve Command]]), 1963]]

The commander of [[Kostrad]], a formation within the [[Indonesian Army]], is called 'Panglima Kostrad'. One of such notable '''''Panglima Kostrad''''' is the first, [[Suharto]], who later became a [[President of Indonesia]] (1968–1998), and the second, [[Umar Wirahadikusumah]], who became [[Vice President of Indonesia]] (1983–1988).

Each commander of [[Indonesian Army|Military Territorial Commands]] (''Komando Daerah Militer'', usually known with the acronym ''Kodam'') has the title ''''''Panglima Daerah Militer'''''' or '''Pangdam'''. There are 17 Kodam, each with one Pangdam.

Each commander of the three [[Indonesian Navy|Fleet Command]]s is given title 'Panglima'. The commander of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Fleet Command (''Komando Armada I/II/III''), are known as '''''Panglima Armada I/II/III''''' or '''Pangarmada I/II/III'''. 

Similar to the Navy, each commander of the three [[Indonesian Air Force|Air Force Operations Command]]s is also given title 'Panglima'. The commander of Air Force Operations Command - 1/2/3 (''Komando Operasi TNI Angkatan Udara I/II/II or Koopsau I/II/III''), are known as '''''Panglima Koopsau I/II/III'''''. 

The Highest position in [[Indonesian Navy|Military Sea-lift Command]] (''Komando Lintas Laut Militer'' /''Kolinlamil'') are given the title of 'Panglima', which is '''''Panglima Kolinlamil'''''.

[[Indonesian National Air Defense Forces Command|National Air Defence Forces Command]] (''Komando Pertahanan Udara Nasional'' /''Kohanudnas'') also use the title of 'Panglima' for its highest position, which is '''''Panglima Kohanudnas''''' and for its each Commander of Air Defense Sector ('''''Panglima Komando Sektor Pertahanan Udara Nasional''''' or '''''Pangkosek Hanudnas''''').

===Use in the Past===
Upon the formation of the [[Fourth Working Cabinet]] (19 November 1963), the title 'Panglima' was used for the commander of each branch of Indonesian Armed Forces.&lt;ref&gt;Aside from the three branches - Army, Navy, Air Force - [[Indonesian National Police]] was included in the Armed Forces since 1962 until it was excluded again in 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; They were also members of the Cabinet. Therefore, they were given the title '''Menteri''' (Minister), appointed directly by the [[President of Indonesia|President]]. As such, their titles were: 
* Minister/Commander of the Army (''Menteri/Panglima Angkatan Darat'', abbreviated ''Menpangad'') 
* Minister/Commander of the Navy (''Menteri/Panglima Angkatan Laut'', abbreviated ''Menpangal'') 
* Minister/Commander of the Air Force (''Menteri/Panglima Angkatan Udara'', abbreviated ''Menpangau'') 
* Minister/Commander of the Police (''Menteri/Panglima Angkatan Kepolisian'', abbreviated ''Menpangak'')
This use was discontinued in the [[New Order (Indonesia)|New Order]] era, replaced with the title '''Kepala Staf''' (Chief of Staff) for the commander of three branches and '''Kepala''' (Chief) for the Chief of National Police.

==Use in Malaysia==

===Panglima Angkatan Tentera===
In [[Malaysian Armed Forces]] ('''Angkatan Tentera Malaysia''') the highest position overseeing the branches - Army, Navy, Air Force - is called '''Panglima Angkatan Tentera Malaysia''' (in official English translation: '''Chief of Defence Force''').

===Panglima Tentera===
Each branch of [[Malaysian Armed Forces]] has a ''Panglima'' at its head. Chief of Army is '''Panglima Tentera Darat''', Chief of Navy is '''Panglima Tentera Laut''', and Chief of Air Force is '''Panglima Tentera Udara'''. Each of them also has a deputy commander, called '''Timbalan Panglima''' (Deputy Chief).

===Other Use===
The word 'Panglima' is used for several titles in the [[Orders, decorations, and medals of Malaysia|orders and decorations of Malaysia]], such as ''Panglima Mangku Negara'' (P.M.N), ''Panglima Setia Mahkota'' (P.S.M.), ''Panglima Jasa Negara'' (P.J.N.), and ''Panglima Setia Diraja'' (P.S.D.).

"'''Polish parliament'''" ([[Swedish language|Swedish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]: ''Polsk riksdag''; {{lang-da|Polsk rigsdag}}; {{lang-de|Polnischer Reichstag}}; {{lang-nl|Poolse landdag}}; {{lang-pl|Polski parlament}}; {{lang-fi|Puolalainen parlamentti}}) is an expression referring to the historical [[Sejm walny|Polish parliaments (''Sejm walny'')]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I2IhmyMpcuYC&amp;pg=PA389 |title=Building Capitalism: The Transformation of the Former Soviet Bloc |last=Åslund |first=Anders |authorlink=Anders Åslund |year=2002 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |page=389 |ISBN=0-521-80525-2 |accessdate=2010-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It implies [[wikt:chaos|chaos]] and general disorder, and that no real decision can be reached during sessions.

== Origin ==

Every single member of the Polish parliament during the 17th and 18th century had an absolute [[veto]] ({{lang-la|[[liberum veto]]}}); as a result, legislation could only be passed [[unanimity|unanimously]]. Originally, the procedure was used for technical issues such as [[Point of order|points of order]], but as diverging interests discovered they could disrupt their opponents' agendas singlehandedly, the process came to be abused. Today, the expression is mostly used to describe an assembly that is too easy for minorities or individuals to disrupt and/or has too many parties present for meaningful and orderly debate and decision-making to take place.
The expression is found in several European languages, including all [[Scandinavian languages]].

{{other uses|powder puff (disambiguation)}}

[[Image:Powder puff football.jpg|thumb|Junior and senior girls face off in a high school powderpuff flag football game]]
In the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], '''powderpuff''' football games are [[flag football]] or [[touch football (American)|touch football]] games between girls from junior and senior classes or cross-town school rivals. Funds from the ticket and concession sales for the game typically go to charity, the senior class, or to a dance. The games are an annual tradition at many [[high school]]s and [[University|universities]].

The term originates from the [[powder puff]], the soft material used for the application of cosmetic face powder. The games usually occur before [[homecoming]].

Many schools that participate in powderpuff games have created their own traditions. Some examples of traditions that make the event more entertaining for students are the creation of team uniform T-shirts for each of the classes, pre-game pep talks to get everyone "pumped", and special half-time performances from the class's male members, sometimes with them dressing up in female clothing.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

It is not clear when the first powderpuff football game was played, although there is photographic evidence of it being played as early as 1931 at Western State College of Colorado (now Western State Colorado University) in Gunnison, Colorado.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barker|first=Brian|title=Director of Marketing |url=http://www.western.edu/news/first-powderpuffs |publisher=Western State Colorado University |accessdate=February 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first well-documented powderpuff football games was played on October 20, 1945, at [[Dakota State University|Eastern State Teachers College]], in [[Madison, South Dakota]].&lt;ref name="HoLC"&gt;{{cite book |last=Nelles |first=Robert |title=History of Lake County|year=1995|publisher=Lake County Historical Society|pages=342–344}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eastern had cancelled many campus activities for the duration of World War II. Among these were the annual homecoming celebration and intercollegiate sports, including football&lt;ref name="Eastern"/&gt; With the signing of the peace treaty with Japan on September 2, 1945, and the war’s official end, Homecoming was again on the schedule at Eastern. The traditional football game seemed out of the question, however, due to the wartime [[Conscription in the United States|military draft]]. Just three men had enrolled for the fall term that year.&lt;ref name="HoLC"/&gt;

"A bunch of us were sitting around after gym class and we thought, if we’re going to have Homecoming, we've got to have a football game," said Susie Lowry, who was a freshman at Eastern in 1945. "We decided we should have a game of our own."&lt;ref name="LadyL"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holtzmann|first=Roger|title=Lady Leatherheads|journal=South Dakota Magazine|date=Nov–Dec 2011|volume=27|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert C. Nelles, a freshman at Eastern that year, was on the Homecoming committee. The very idea of women playing football "was enough to curl your teeth", he wrote in an account of the game for the ''History of Lake County'', but the committee nonetheless gave its approval for a game with all women players.&lt;ref name="HoLC"/&gt;

There were two groups of Eastern coeds at the time: those who lived at their homes in Madison while attending classes on campus, and those from surrounding small towns who lived in the dorm. The 23 girls who wanted to play football divided into two teams, informally known as the Townies and Dormies.&lt;ref name="LadyL"/&gt; On game day, the teams were designated Blue and Gold teams, respectively, which were Eastern’s school colors.&lt;ref name="Eastern"&gt;{{cite news|title=Eastern Day is Again Held|newspaper=The Eastern|date=October 1945}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leota Van Ornum, Eastern's physical education teacher, served as coach for both teams. There was a high school on Eastern’s campus where students training to be teachers did their practice teaching. Robert Ormseth, who coached that school's football team, served as her assistant.&lt;ref name="Debs"&gt;{{cite news|title=Football Game Played by Debs|newspaper=Madison Daily Leader|date=October 22, 1945}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"A fairly large group of spectators showed great interest and enthusiasm during the game," according to ''The Eastern'', the campus newspaper.&lt;ref name="Eastern"/&gt; Friends and family and alumni were surely well represented, because the twenty-three players constituted almost half of Eastern’s enrollment of fifty-three that term. Robert Nelles and Paul Tommeraasen, two of the three male students, were pressed into service as game officials.&lt;ref name="HoLC"/&gt;

“We tried to be almost real, with huddles and all that," said Lowry. "There was a lot of clowning around. A few of us fell down, just to make it look good, but it wasn’t really rough or anything."&lt;ref name="LadyL" /&gt;

The neophyte gridders proved more adept at defense than offense, with each team holding the other scoreless until the game's final minute. Doris Treloar of the Gold team finally broke through and scored a touchdown, which was immediately answered by Nancy Baughman of the Blue. Professor A.E. Swan, the librarian serving as the referee, considered that an opportune moment to end the contest on an amiable note.&lt;ref name="LadyL" /&gt;

In its story about the game, the ''Madison Daily Leader'' dubbed the two teams "The Powderpuff and Rouge Elevens&lt;ref name="Debs" /&gt; The name was suggested because the women chose to poke fun at themselves by staying on the field at halftime and putting on fresh makeup before the amused spectators.&lt;ref name="Eastern" /&gt;
[[File:Ppuff.jpg|thumb|Lyman Hall and Sheehan High School compete in Annual Samaha Bowl 2015]]
The first powderpuff football game of the modern era was held in 1972, in [[Wallingford, Connecticut]]. Judy Samaha, a physical education teacher and coach for [[Mark T. Sheehan High School]] at the time, began this sport to incorporate more girls into athletic activities. She contacted [[Lyman Hall High School]], Sheehan's rival, to set up a small but fierce game between the schools. Since then, powderpuff football has spread over the nation, from neighboring towns in Connecticut to schools in California, Texas, and Florida.  The annual Samaha bowl game still takes place the Wednesday before Thanksgiving as the longest running powderpuff game in the country.

The tradition was adopted in Massachusetts at schools such as [[Pope John XXIII High School (Everett, Massachusetts)|Pope John XXIII High School]] where underclass girls faced upperclass girls. The tradition still lives with schools like Mystic Valley Regional Charter School playing once a year the day before Thanksgiving Day, or [[St. David's School (Raleigh, North Carolina)|St. David's School]] in Raleigh, NC, which attracts a stadium full of spectators for a high-energy game under the lights.

== Blondes vs. brunettes charity football ==
{{Main article|Blondes vs. brunettes powderpuff football}}

Blondes vs. Brunettes is a powderpuff [[American football|football]] game played in cities across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blondesvsbrunettes.org/ Blondes vs. Brunettes Powderpuff Fundraiser]&lt;/ref&gt; Proceeds from the event are donated to the [[Alzheimer's Association]].  The annual contests were started by Sara Allen Abbott whose father, Texas State Representative [[Joseph Hugh Allen]], died of [[Alzheimer's disease]] in 2008.  Looking for a way to raise funds for the Alzheimer's Association, Abbott organized a powderpuff football game in tribute to her father, a lifelong football fan.

In the fall of 2005, the first [[blonde]] vs. [[brunette]] powder puff football game was played at [[Hains Point]] in Washington, D.C. and raised $10,000.  Subsequently, the game searched for a more suitable home and moved around the Washington, D.C area before settling in at [[George Washington University]]’s Mount Vernon Athletic Field in 2009.  The game has received considerable publicity to include feature articles in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and local TV stations and has raised over $500,000 in the national capital area alone.  Blondes vs. Brunettes Charity Football is currently played in 16 cities in the United States.  Abbott plans to continue the expansion to more cities and eventually establish a "Blondes vs. Brunettes [[Super Bowl]]."&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Washington Post]]''. "Athletes First, Stylistas Second". November 19, 2011, pg. A13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Washington Post]]''.

== Controversy ==

=== Gender Roles ===
Despite widespread popularity of powderpuff games, they have faced backlash for enforcing gender stereotypes. Teachers and parents alike have criticized the games for "demeaning women's athletic ability",  citing how the name implies that girls are fragile and only fit to play flag football.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.denebolaonline.net/2007/11/21/powderpuff-ignites-controversy-over-gender-roles/|title=Denebola  » Article  » Powderpuff ignites controversy over gender roles|last=Denebola|website=www.denebolaonline.net|access-date=2016-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the argument that girls should feel like they are able to play football whenever they want, and having to have a special spectacle just for female students to participate in a male-dominated sport is a mockery of the abilities of female athletes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.denebolaonline.net/2009/11/25/a-fresh-take-on-the-yearly-powderpuff-debate/|title=Denebola  » Article  » A fresh take on the yearly Powderpuff debate|last=Denebola|website=www.denebolaonline.net|access-date=2016-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Violence ===
Powderpuff games have also come under fire for encouraging violence between peers, especially at some schools where junior girls are subject to hazing by the senior class. In 2003, two Chicago area high-schools participated in hazing that led to five girls being hospitalized. School officials noted that the game was not an official, school-sanctioned activity and the school did not promote, plan, or even know about the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2003-05-07-chicago-hazing_x.htm|title=USATODAY.com - 'Powder puff' hazing turns ugly|website=usatoday30.usatoday.com|access-date=2016-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rasul Rza was Chairman of [[Writers' Union of Azerbaijan]] in 1939, minister of Azerbaijani Cinematography (1945–48), chief editor of the [[Azerbaijani Soviet Encyclopedia]] (1966–75), member of board of directors of [[USSR Union of Writers]] (from 1964). With start of his career he adopted a shortened name Rasul Rza.

His first poem was called ''Bu gün'' (''Today''), published in [[Tbilisi]]. His serious multidimensional writings began in the 1930s. During the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Great Patriotic War]], he published many novels calling for patriotic spirit. He also wrote a poem about [[Lenin]]. In the 60s, he began writing in more philosophical tone relating his novels to intellectual source, analytical thinking, philosophical approach to daily life and so forth. The lyrical poems, dramas, proses he wrote hinted to sustained and subtle criticism of the Soviet regime, for which was banned to write for a period of time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=h4N_dneMybQC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;lpg=PA95&amp;dq=Rasul+Rza&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=d6TQRGZNId&amp;sig=mhL2anhW4QdvJQF1K_28MjujsMo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=YQ5GTNb7KcH88Ab714TjBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwCTge#v=onepage&amp;q=Rasul%20Rza&amp;f=false Aesopian literary dimensions of Azerbaijani literature of the Soviet period. Maliheh S. Tyrrell, page 47]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, he began composing songs to his poems.

A typical rich black mixture might be 100% black, 50% of each of the other three inks.  Other percentages are used to achieve specific results, for example 100% black with 70% [[cyan]] (C), 35% [[magenta]] (M), and 40% [[yellow]] (Y) is used to achieve "cool" black. "Warm Black" is 35%C, 60%M, 60%Y, and 100%K. The colored ink under the black ink makes a "richer" result; the additional inks absorb more light, resulting in a closer approximation of true black. While, in theory, an even richer black can be made by using 100% of each of the four inks, in practice, the amount of non-black ink added is limited by the wetness that the [[paper]] and printing process can handle.&lt;ref name="graphicprint"&gt;{{cite book | title=A Guide to Graphic Print Production | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |author1=Johansson, Kaj |author2=Lundberg, Peter |author3=Ryberg, Robert | year=2012 | pages=332 | isbn=9781118184875}}&lt;/ref&gt; (A safe and practical rule of thumb is that ink coverage should not exceed 240% on normal papers. Papers that "pick", such as low-end recycled papers, should have even less coverage.) Wetness is not a problem with [[laser printer]]s, however, and [[registration black]] (or "400% black") produces very striking results in laser prints. Interesting effects can also be achieved with a laser printer by combining 100% black and 100% of cyan, magenta, or yellow.&lt;ref name="regmarks"&gt;{{cite book | title=Intelligent Vision Systems for Industry | publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |author1=Batchelor, Bruce |author2=Whelan, Paul | year=2012 | pages=12 | isbn=9781447104315}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other printing standards also provide rich black guidelines, such as [[FOGRA39]] for [[coated paper]] (91%C, 79%M, 62%Y, and 97%K), and [[FOGRA29]] for uncoated paper (96%C, 70%M, 46%Y, and 86%K).&lt;ref name="forga-table"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.color.org/FOGRA39.txt | title=FOGRA39 | publisher=Fogra Forschungsgesellschaft Druck e.V. | date=December 2006 | accessdate=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rich black is often regarded as a color that is "blacker than black". While this is impossible from the point of view of [[color theory]], the difference can often be seen in the printed piece. The difference is most apparent in backlit (also known as "translite") pieces, where rich black more thoroughly blocks the light from coming through.

The use of rich black has to be based on a full understanding of the printing conditions, including the inks, [[printing press]] and especially the paper. If too much ink is used on poor quality paper such as [[newsprint]], this may cause the paper to literally fall apart. In addition, excessive amounts of ink may not have a chance to fully dry before the printed result comes into contact with other pages.  The additional ink used to create rich black also results in higher printing costs.&lt;ref name="production-for-print"&gt;{{cite book | title=Production for Print | publisher=Laurence King Publishing | author=Gatter, Mark | year=2010 | pages=160 | isbn=9781856696999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Care must be taken when using electronic design programs (e.g. when managing a CMYK document in [[Adobe Illustrator]] or [[Corel Draw]])&amp;nbsp;– "black" may or may not equal 100%K depending on the CMYK profile specified in the image's settings, and Photoshop will represent the various tones using [[RGB color model|RGB]] values close to black; in an RGB document, "black" always equals RGB value (0, 0, 0).&lt;ref name="production-for-print"/&gt;

Another reason to use rich black for small areas of black is to avoid [[Spreading and choking|trapping]] issues. Rich black is often used for text printed over a picture or colored background, because otherwise any slight mis-registration between printing plates would produce a white or colored halo around the text, making it much harder to read.&lt;ref name="thebooklover"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22606 | title=The Booklover and His Books | author=Koopman, Harry Lyman | year=2007 | pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="production-for-print"/&gt;&lt;ref name="simon-downs"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Is it a book, is it a screen, no it's…—graphics and the interface in electronic paper | author=Downs, Simon | journal=Digital Creativity | year=2005 | volume=16 | issue=1 | pages=31–32 | doi=10.1080/14626260500147751}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His major work was ''Antiquæ Linguæ Britannicæ Thesaurus'', Bristol, 1753, a Welsh-English Dictionary, with a Welsh grammar prefixed, dedicated to [[Frederick, Prince of Wales]]. Based mainly on the work of [[John Davies (Mallwyd)|John Davies]] and [[Edward Llwyd]], his dictionary was fuller than any which had yet appeared.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; Other sources were [[William Wotton]] and [[Richard Morris (Welsh scholar)|Richard Morris]].&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=23540|title=Richards, Thomas|first=Richard|last=Crowe}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that Richards borrowed manuscripts from [[John Bradford (poet)|John Bradford]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://iolomorganwg.wales.ac.uk/pobl-johnbradford.php iolomorganwg.wales.ac.uk page, ''John Bradford (1706-85)''].&lt;/ref&gt; A second edition appeared at [[Trefriw]] in 1815, a third in the same year at [[Dolgellau]], and a fourth at [[Merthyr Tydfil]] in 1838.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

Richards was credited with work on the 1812 edition of [[William Evans (lexicographer)|William Evans]]'s English-Welsh dictionary.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

The terms '''top''', '''bottom''' and '''versatile''' (or '''switch''') are used to describe roles for the duration of a sometimes sexual act, or may be used more broadly as a psychological, social, and sexual identity, as well as indicating one's usual preference. The terms top, bottom and switch are also used in [[BDSM]], with slightly different meanings. In both contexts, the terms ''top'' and ''bottom'' refer to dominant or submissive, or active and passive roles, not to who is physically on top in a particular sexual act.

There is considerable controversy about the prevalence of tops and bottoms among male/female and straight/gay populations.

Beginning in the 1970s, in some American contexts, people would identify their interests by wearing a set of keys on the side of their belt or a [[handkerchief codes|color-coded handkerchief]] in their rear pockets. This practice, called ''flagging'', began in the gay male subculture.

==Top==
{{Main|Top (BDSM)}}
In BDSM, ''top'' means:
* a dominant partner in BDSM play (such as [[flogging]], [[bondage (BDSM)|binding]], [[servitude (BDSM)|being master]], [[humiliation (BDSM)|humiliating]], and sexual play)
* a partner who applies stimulation to another, and who may or may not be [[dominant (BDSM)|dominant]]
** '''Topping from the bottom''' is a related BDSM term, meaning a person simultaneously adopts the role of [[Top and bottom in sex and BDSM#Bottom|bottom]] and [[Top and bottom in sex and BDSM#Dominant and submissive|dom]].
**a [[service top]] is a person who applies sensation or control to a bottom, but does so at the bottom's explicit instruction.

==Bottom==
{{Main|Bottom (BDSM)}}
In BDSM, ''bottom'' means:
* a submissive partner in sexual play (such as in being flogged, tied, humiliated, or made to serve)
* a partner who receives stimulation from another, and who may or may not be submissive
* a partner who enjoys submission on a temporary, limited basis

A bottom in BDSM does not have to be the receptive partner; for example, a [[female dominance|female dominant]] may command her submissive to penetrate her.

==Switch==
{{Main|Switch (BDSM)}}
A switch is someone who participates in BDSM activities sometimes as a top and other times as a bottom or (in the case of [[Domination &amp; submission (BDSM)|dominance and submission]]) sometimes as a [[dominant (BDSM)|dominant]] and other times as a [[submissive (BDSM)|submissive]]. This is sometimes referred to as being ''versatile''.

==Dominant and submissive==
{{details|Dominance and submission}}
Those who take the superior position in [[dominance and submission]] scenes and relationships are called [[dominant (BDSM)|dominants]], doms (male) or dommes (female), while those who take the subordinate position are called [[submissive (BDSM)|submissives]] or subs (male or female). A top filling the ''dominant role'' is not necessarily ''a'' dominant, and vice versa, and a bottom is not necessarily submissive.

The main difference between a dominant and a top is that the dominant ostensibly does not follow instructions, although they are limited by what the submissive is willing to do. The top may sometimes even be the partner who is ''following'' instructions, i.e., they top when, and in the manner, requested by the bottom. Contrast this with the pure dominant, who might give orders to a submissive, or otherwise employ physical or psychological techniques of control, but might instruct the submissive to perform the act on them.

The main difference between a submissive and a bottom is that the submissive ostensibly does not give instructions, although they do set limits on what the dominant can do.  A bottom is not necessarily a submissive; they may enjoy intense physical and psychological stimulation but not submit to the person delivering it. Similarly, a submissive might not be a bottom; they may enjoy taking orders from a dominant without receiving any physical stimulation. For ''bottoms'' who are not submissive, the bottom is most often the partner who is giving instructions—the top typically tops when, and in the manner, requested by the bottom.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

Many distinguish top/bottom from dominant/submissive by seeing top/bottom as an expression of physical power, while dominant/submissive is an expression of psychological power. In many cases, the dominant/submissive relationship involves the dominant party psychologically tearing down and denigrating the submissive (consensually, meeting the submissive's expressed needs and respecting hard limits). In contrast, the top/bottom relationship is more commonly marked by mutual respect and support.

==Sadist and masochist==
{{Details|Sadomasochism}}
The terms [[sadism and masochism]], while reflecting a "do" vs. "done to" distinction similar to top and bottom, are more narrowly defined as the giving and receiving of pain (often referred to as 'sensation').

'''Yuriy Ruf'''  (Ukrainian: Юрій Руф) is a [[List of Ukrainian-language poets|Ukrainian poet]], writer, scientist, public figure, and founder of a literary project "Дух Нації" ("Nation's spirit"). Born in 1980 in Ternopil region of Ukraine. His publications include "Багряна лірика" (2012), "Час Революції" (2014), and "На зламі епох" (2015). His poetry was also included in Ukrainian modern nationalist poetry compilations "Голос крові" (2013), and "Відлуння свинцевих громовиць" (2015).
[[File:Yuriy Ruf. Юрій Руф на Сході.jpg|left|thumb|Yuriy Ruf holding a "Дух Нації" flag with Ukrainian soldiers at the front line in Donbas.]]
Yuriy Ruf began writing poetry when he was 14 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vlasno.info/spetsproekti/1/persona/item/8618-yakshcho-my-ne-ukrainizuiemo-front-povzucha-rusyfikatsiia-vizme-svoie-yurii-ruf-u-vinnytsi|title="Якщо ми не українізуємо фронт, повзуча русифікація візьме своє" —  Юрій Руф у Вінниці {{!}} Новини Вінниці {{!}} Новости Винницы {{!}} ВЛАСНО.info|last=Новак|first=Богдан|website=vlasno.info|access-date=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is known for his critical views toward traditional Ukrainian poetry where, according to him, Ukrainians are predominantly portrayed as poor and ill-fated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vn.20minut.ua/Kult-podii/poet-natsionalist-yuriy-ruf-obraz-mertvogo-kozaka-ta-zaplakanoyi-divch-10479605.html|title=Поет Юрій Руф: образ мертвого козака та заплаканої дівчини українцям нав’язують грантодавці - 20 хвилин|website=vn.20minut.ua|access-date=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believes such poetry lowers self-esteem and a sense of national pride. He, therefore, considers his poetry to be a type of poetic propaganda of patriotism. Fans describe his poetry as "front line lyrics", that is poetry of war and patriotism aimed at raising fighting spirit, delivering motivation, and a sense of national pride.

His most recent publication "На зламі епох" (2015) is dedicated to Ukrainian heroes of the current [[Russian-Ukrainian War 2014|Russian-Ukrainian war]], and contains verses honoring certain individuals, military units, Ukrainian soldiers, battles, and other wartime events.

He lives in [[Lviv]], and is a father of two children.
