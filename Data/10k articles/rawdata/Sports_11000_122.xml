The organization ceased to function within a few years, and should not be confused with others of the same name founded in 1871 and 1874 (which organized the Third American Chess Congress), or the later American Chess Federation (a successor to the Western Chess Association), which merged with the National Chess Federation in 1939 to form the current  [[United States Chess Federation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Before the USCF: Early American Chess Associations | periodical=[[Chess Life]] | date=January 2009 | first=John | last=McCrary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Associated Press NFL Most Valuable Player Award''' is presented annually by the [[Associated Press]] (AP) to a player in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) deemed to have been the "[[Most valuable player|most valuable]]" in that year's [[National Football League regular season|regular season]]. While there have been many selectors of [[NFL MVP]]s in the past, today the MVP award presented by the AP is considered the ''[[de facto]]'' official NFL MVP award and the most prestigious.&lt;ref name=NewtonPFWA&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bieler|first1=Des|title=Pro Football Writers name Cam Newton their NFL MVP|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2016/01/20/pro-football-writers-name-cam-newton-their-nfl-mvp/|accessdate=June 22, 2016|work=The Washington Post|date=January 20, 2016|quote=The AP NFL awards, which essentially serve as the official league honors...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thomas|first1=Jim|title=Warner is in hunt for another NFL honor|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/8704701/warner_is_in_hunt_for_another_nfl_honor/|accessdate=February 2, 2017|work=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|date=January 10, 2002|page=20|quote=The Associated Press MVP award is the most prestigious, but it's only Round 1 when it comes to NFL player-of-the-year awards.|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2011, the NFL has held the annual [[NFL Honors]] ceremony to recognize the winner of each year's AP MVP award, along with other AP awards, such as the [[AP NFL Offensive Player of the Year]] and [[AP NFL Defensive Player of the Year]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First-ever 'NFL Honors' show will be hosted by Baldwin in Indy|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d825af687/article/firstever-nfl-honors-show-will-be-hosted-by-baldwin-in-indy|website=NFL.com|publisher=National Football League|accessdate=June 21, 2016|date=January 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current AP NFL MVP is [[quarterback]] [[Tom Brady]] of the [[New England Patriots]], who won the award for the third time after the 2017 NFL season.&lt;ref name=Brady2017&gt;{{cite news|title=Tom Brady Wins His Third M.V.P.

The AP has presented an award recognizing the NFL's top player since 1957. The award is voted upon by a panel of 50 sportswriters at the end of the [[regular season]], before the [[playoffs]], though the results are not announced to the public until the day before the [[Super Bowl]]. The sportswriters chosen regularly follow the NFL, and remain mostly consistent from year to year. They are chosen based on expertise and are independent of the league itself.&lt;ref name=Insight/&gt; Voters for the award have included [[Troy Aikman]] of [[Fox Sports]]; [[Cris Collinsworth]] and [[Tony Dungy]] of [[NBC Sports]]; and [[Herm Edwards]] of [[ESPN]].&lt;ref name=Insight/&gt; The only player to be voted unanimously is Brady, who received all 50 votes for the 2010 season's award.&lt;ref name=Brady2010&gt;{{cite news|title=It’s Unanimous: Brady Is N.F.L.'s Most Valuable|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/07/sports/football/07mvp.html|accessdate=February 2, 2017|work=The New York Times|agency=Associated Press|date=February 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to voters' tendency to favor offensive positions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mays|first1=Robert|title=How Hard Is It for a Defensive Player to Win NFL MVP?

Two defensive players have won the award: [[Alan Page]] in 1971 as a [[defensive tackle]], and [[Lawrence Taylor]] as a [[linebacker]] in 1986. The sole [[special teams]] player to be named AP NFL MVP was [[Mark Moseley]], who won as a [[placekicker]] in 1982.&lt;ref name=official/&gt;

Thirteen awardees also won the [[Super Bowl]] (or [[NFL Championship Game]] prior to 1966) in the same season.

'''Bradbury Norton Robinson, Jr.''' (February 1, 1884 – March 7, 1949) was a pioneering [[American football]] player, physician, nutritionist, conservationist and local politician. He played [[college football]] at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|University of Wisconsin]] in 1903 and at [[Saint Louis University]] from 1904 to 1907.  In 1904, through personal connections to Wisconsin governor [[Robert M. La Follette, Sr.]] and his wife, [[Belle Case La Follette|Belle Case]], Robinson learned of calls for reforms to the game of football from [[President of the United States|President]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]], and began to develop tactics for passing.&lt;ref name= BNR87 /&gt; After moving to Saint Louis University, Robinson threw the first legal [[forward pass]] in the [[history of American football]] on September 5, 1906, at a game at [[Carroll University|Carroll College]] in [[Waukesha, Wisconsin]].&lt;ref name = SLPTT /&gt; He became the sport's first [[triple threat man]], excelling at running, passing, and kicking.&lt;ref name = SLPTT /&gt; He was also a member of St. Louis' "Olympic World's Champions" football team in 1904.&lt;ref name = S1904&gt;Spalding's Official Athletic Almanac 1905&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = S1905&gt;Spalding's Official Foot Ball Guide for 1905&lt;/ref&gt;

Robinson graduated from Saint Louis University in 1908 with a medical degree and practiced as a surgeon at the [[Mayo Clinic]] in [[Rochester, Minnesota]].&lt;ref name = michigan /&gt;

In [[World War I]], he was commissioned a captain of infantry in the [[U.S. Army]], arriving in France in 1918 where he became an instructor in the use of the newly-developed [[Tank Corps of the American Expeditionary Forces|tank]], later serving as a front line infantry officer in the last ten days of the war.&lt;ref name = michigan /&gt;

He remained in the Army until September 1919, during which time he studied advanced medical techniques at the [[University of Bordeaux]]. In the early 1920s, he oversaw the medical screening of immigrants while serving on the European staff of [[Hugh S. Cumming]], [[Surgeon General of the United States]].&lt;ref name = michigan /&gt;

He returned to the United States in 1926 and practiced medicine in [[St. Louis, Michigan]], where he was twice elected the city's mayor.&lt;ref name = michigan /&gt;

In the 1940s, Robinson was among the first to warn against the dangers of [[DDT]] use in agriculture.&lt;ref name= DDT /&gt;

==Early life==
After Robinson's birth in [[Bellevue, Ohio]] and while still a toddler, his family moved to [[St. Louis, Missouri]] where Robinson's father, Bradbury Norton Robinson, Sr. (1842–1925),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=153440195|title=Bradbury Norton Robinson, Sr. (1842 - 1925) - Find A Grave Memorial – ''other sources give the death year as 1924 ''|website=findagrave.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; became general baggage agent for the [[Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad]]. The senior Robinson spent most of his adult life working for railroads. Born in [[Lowell, Massachusetts]], he served one year as a sergeant in [[6th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Militia|Company C of the 6th Massachusetts Infantry]] at the opening of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].&lt;ref name= BARABOO /&gt; During the [[Baltimore riot of 1861|Baltimore Riot]] of April 19, 1861, one week after [[Fort Sumter]], the 6th Massachusetts became the first [[Union Army|Union unit]] to take casualties in action. After his discharge, he moved his family to [[Missouri]] in 1862 to participate in the construction of the [[Missouri Pacific Railroad]] from St. Louis to [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]].&lt;ref name = michigan&gt;''Michigan Centennial History'', Volume 5, pages 109 to 111, 1939&lt;/ref&gt;

The younger Robinson was three years old when the family moved again in 1887 to [[Baraboo, Wisconsin]], to be near his mother's family. Amelia Isabella Lee Robinson (1856–1930)&lt;ref name= BARABOO /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=153439989|title=Amelia Lee Robinson (1856 - 1930) - Find A Grave Memorial|website=findagrave.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; was born in [[London, England]] and moved with her parents to the Baraboo area in 1878.&lt;ref name = michigan/&gt;&lt;ref name= BARABOO&gt;[http://www.baraboopubliclibrary.org/files/local/dewelvol4/34%20first%20legal%20forward%20pass%20and%20baraboo%20001.pdf Letter of the Baraboo Chief of Police at the Baraboo, Wisconsin Public Library]&lt;/ref&gt; She married the senior Robinson at her parent's farm in [[Merrimac, Wisconsin|Merrimack, Wisconsin]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.villageofmerrimac.org/History.htm Village of Merrimac History - the name of the town was spelled "Merrimack" until 1950]&lt;/ref&gt;  some 11 miles from Baraboo, in June 1881.&lt;ref name= BARABOO /&gt; Her husband served as Baraboo City Marshal from 1903 to 1904.&lt;ref name= BARABOO /&gt; The Marshal's office was the predecessor to the city's police department.&lt;ref name= BARABOO /&gt;

Brad Jr. and his sisters, Jennie and Nellie, grew up on the Robinsons' small farm across from the [[Sauk County]] Fairgrounds.&lt;ref name= BARABOO /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://saukcountyfair.com/directions/ Sauk County Fair Website]&lt;/ref&gt; He attended Baraboo public schools and graduated from high school in 1902.&lt;ref name= BARABOO /&gt; Robinson later joked that Baraboo was "made famous by the [[Ringling Brothers Circus]] ... and myself." The Circus was founded the same year that Robinson was born.

Robinson was a sixth great-grandson of [[Mary Bradbury]] (1615–1700), a convicted Salem witch who escaped execution.&lt;ref name= FGBRN&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/27980338/bradbury-norton-robinson |title=Bradbury Norton Robinson, Jr (1884 - 1949) - Find A Grave Memorial|website=findagrave.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a first cousin four times removed of Bradbury Robinson (1752–1801), who fought for the patriots at [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|Concord]] in 1775.&lt;ref name= FGBRN /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://catalog.archives.gov/id/6883168 Deposition #18 of Bradbury Robinson, et al.

==1903: Freshman "star" at Wisconsin==
[[File:Wisconsin1903FootballTeam.jpg|thumb|right|300px|1903 Wisconsin Badger football team; Robinson, front row, right]]
Robinson enrolled at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|University of Wisconsin]] and played for the [[Wisconsin Badgers football|Badgers varsity team]] as a freshman in the [[1903 Wisconsin Badgers football team|1903 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=In the Sporting World |author= |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/14726541/robinson_on_wisconsin_first_team_by/ |newspaper=[[The Oshkosh Northwestern]] |date=November 5, 1903 |accessdate=October 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His arrival was seen by a sports reporter at the time as something of a godsend. Writing on August 23, 1903, the unidentified journalist reported:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...  a temporary disappointment, the information that O'Brien, the best candidate for the place of Center Remp, had decided not to return to the university, but had accepted a place for $500 to coach the [[Appleton, Wisconsin|Appleton]] high school eleven. The disappointment was cured, however, by the announcement that Robinson, who weighs nearly 200 pounds, had resigned his place at the state insane asylum at Mendota&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dhs.wisconsin.gov/mh_mendota/Mendota/MMHIHist.htm|title=Mendota Mental Health Institute|publisher=|access-date=2008-08-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926072343/http://dhs.wisconsin.gov/MH_Mendota/Mendota/MMHIHIST.HTM#|archive-date=2008-09-26|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [now part of [[Madison, Wisconsin]]] and would enter the football squad in perfect trim, having systematically trained for the past six weeks.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Robinson's first and only season at Madison, "the Cardinal team" under [[Arthur Hale Curtis]] went 6–3–1, suffering shut-out losses to rivals [[1903 Minnesota Golden Gophers football team|Minnesota]] and [[1903 Michigan Wolverines football team|Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uwbadgers.com/sport_news/fb/stat_poll/all-time%20scores_3806.pdf|title=Wisconsin Badger All-Time Scores|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080909213648/http://www.uwbadgers.com/sport_news/fb/stat_poll/all-time%20scores_3806.pdf|archivedate=2008-09-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson did get a chance to shine in the Badgers' 87–0 defeat of [[Beloit Buccaneers football|Beloit]] on October 17,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=In the Sporting World |author= |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/14726609/wisconsin_87_beloit_0_october_19/|newspaper=[[The Oshkosh Northwestern]] |date=October 19, 1903 |accessdate=October 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; when he scored two touchdowns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Badgers Pile Up Score |author= |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/14726642/robinson_scores_2_touchdowns/ |newspaper=[[St. Paul Globe]] |date=October 18, 1903 |accessdate=October 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A newspaperman wrote, "Robinson's star work seems to show [the] second eleven is not far behind the first."

==Spring and summer 1904: The origins of the forward pass==

===The political roots of the pass===
[[File:Belle-Case-La-Follette.jpeg|200px|right|thumb|Belle Case La Follette, c. 1905]]
[[File:Robert M. La Follette, Sr.jpg|140px|right|thumb|Robert M. La Follette, Sr.]]
In addition to the Ringling brothers and Robinson, another notable person from Baraboo, Wisconsin was [[Belle Case La Follette]] (1859–1931).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wisconsinhistory.org/Records/Image/IM27038 1917 photo of Belle Case La Follette with her family]&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[suffragette]] and attorney was, according to ''The New York Times'' at the time of her death, "probably the least known yet most influential of all the American women who had to do with public affairs in this country".&lt;ref&gt;"Wisconsin's Matriarch.", ''The New York Times'', August 20, 1931&lt;/ref&gt;  She taught junior high school in Baraboo before marrying future Wisconsin Congressman, Senator, Governor and Presidential candidate [[Robert M. La Follette, Sr.]]  Mrs. La Follette played an active role in her husband's political career.

In the spring of 1904, Robinson was summoned by Governor La Follette to the Executive Mansion, which was just a short walk from the U of W campus.  In a February 5, 1946 interview with the ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'''s Robert Morrison, Robinson recalled that the Governor's "wife was from my home town and our families were acquainted ... So at the university football practices, where La Follette used to come occasionally, he would often stop to talk to me."

Even so, Robinson was puzzled by the Governor's invitation until, "he showed me a letter from [[Theodore Roosevelt|Teddy Roosevelt]].  There had been a lot of injuries in football and a movement was on foot to abolish the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://townhall.com/columnists/column.aspx/?UrlTitle=one_hundred_years_of_the_forward_pass&amp;ns=TerenceJeffrey&amp;dt=08/30/2006&amp;page=1|title=Conservative news, politics, opinion, breaking news analysis, political cartoons and commentary â€" Townhall|website=Townhall}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tbnweekly.com/content_articles/103106_vpt-02.txt|title=Driver's Seat - A brief history of the forward pass|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Roosevelt wrote that he did not want it wiped out and he thought it was an excellent game for character building, so La Follette asked me 'what do you think can be done to spread the game out and soften it up a bit?' "

Writing in his memoirs, Robinson remembered suggesting "increasing the distance to be gained in a set number of downs, to develop the kicking angle and introducing some of the elements of basketball and English Rugby; with perhaps allowing the throwing of the ball forward."

Sometime later, Robinson "met with the Governor and he told me to develop handling and throwing the ball because he was sure that eventually there would be changes in the rules along that line."

===Robinson learns to pass===
[[File:Howard Paul Savage circa 1915.jpg|140px|right|thumb|Howard Paul Savage, c. 1915]]
It was in the preseason of 1904 that Robinson first completely recognized the potential of the pass.  Robinson later wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... there came to the Wisconsin U squad a tall young Irishman from Chicago.  His name was [[Howard P. Savage|H.P. Savage]], the same who later ... became the National Commander of the [[American Legion]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was known as "High Power" Savage. They were trying to develop me into a kicker at Wisconsin and H.P. generally teamed up with me to catch my punts.  I noticed that he could throw my punts back almost as far as I could kick them.  Here was the trick I must learn. I got H.P. to show me how he did it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Twenty-five years later, Robinson told ''[[St. Louis Globe-Democrat|St. Louis Star-Times]]'' sports editor [[Sid Keener]] (1888–1981)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-fever.com/showthread.php?t=57538&amp;page=3|title=Meet The Sports Writers Baseball Fever|website=www.baseball-fever.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Sid_Keener|title=Sid Keener - BR Bullpen|website=www.baseball-reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Savage threw "the pigskin to his players with the ball revolving as it sailed through the air."

"From then on," Robinson wrote in his memoirs, "my football hobby became forward passing or anyway passing the ball."

A short time after Savage instructed him in the art of throwing a spiral, Robinson got in a fight with the "school bully" and was dismissed from the [[Wisconsin Badgers football|Wisconsin]] football team. Robinson wrote that the incident occurred in the locker room after a practice in which the bully roughly blindsided a teammate. Robinson warned the miscreant not to repeat such unsportsmanlike play. The bully responded by [[sucker punch]]ing Robinson, who proceeded to defend himself with enthusiasm. At that moment, according to Robinson's memoirs, a coach arrived on the scene and incorrectly identified Robinson as the aggressor and dismissed him on the spot. His teammates later explained the situation to the coach, who withdrew the dismissal but refused to give Robinson the apology he demanded.

==1904: Transfer to St. Louis, the Olympics and a perfect, unscored upon season==

Absent the apology, as a matter of honor, Robinson chose to leave Wisconsin, enrolling as a medical student at St. Louis, where he played the 1904 season, although he sat out many games with a broken shoulder blade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gridiron, Diamond and Race-Track News Told by Experts - Men Worked Daily |author= |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/14726720/gridiron_diamond_and_racetrack_news/|newspaper=[[St. Louis Republic]] |date=November 27, 1906 |accessdate=October 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than half the St. Louis squad consisted of future medical doctors.

Soon after arriving in St. Louis, Robinson met 31-year old sportswriter Ed Wray,&lt;ref name= WRAY1&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/12404202/john_wray_enters_state_hall_of_fame/ "John Wray Enters State Hall of Fame", ''St. Louis Post-Dispatch'', November 5, 1967, Page 102]&lt;/ref&gt; beginning a professional friendship that would last for the rest of Robinson's life. Wray was sports [[editing|editor]] of the ''[[St. Louis Globe-Democrat]]'' from 1904 to 1908, which encompassed all of Robinson's playing years. Wray left that post to rejoin the staff at the rival ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'', where he had worked as a sports reporter from 1900 to 1904. He remained at that paper as a sports editor and [[columnist]] until his retirement in 1955.&lt;ref name= WRAY1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-fever.com/showthread.php?t=57538&amp;page=4|title=Meet The Sports Writers Baseball Fever|website=www.baseball-fever.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an eyewitness to what he considered football history, Wray wrote extensively about Robinson and the development of the forward pass, both contemporaneously and in retrospective columns published over the next four decades.

I spoke to Father Burke about it in the presence of one of your reporters, also named Burke (the late Miles Joseph Burke), and he was interested."&lt;ref name = SLP1/&gt;

St. Louis  (under head coach [[Martin J.

Some argue that St. Louis University won the [[Olympic gold medal]] in American football in 1904,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Two Big Local Teams Played Well - Claim of Championship |author= |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/14726813/two_big_local_teams_played_well/|newspaper=[[St. Louis Republic]] |date=November 14, 1904 |accessdate=October 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spalding Athletic Almanac of 1905 offered this commentary:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The (Olympic) Department knew perfectly well that it would be unable to have an Olympic Foot Ball Championship, though it felt incumbent to advertise it. Owing to the conditions in American colleges it would be utterly impossible to have an Olympic foot ball championship decided. The only college that seemed absolutely willing to give up its financial interests to play for the World's Fair Championship was the St. Louis University and there is more apparently in this honor than appears in this report. There were many exhibition contests held in the Stadium under the auspices of the Department wherein teams from the St. Louis University and [[Washington Bears football|Washington University]] took part and competed against other teams from universities east and west of the Mississippi River. The Missouri–[[Purdue Boilermakers football|Purdue]] game was played in the Stadium on October 28 ... The Olympic College Foot Ball Championship was won by St. Louis University, St. Louis, Mo., by default.&lt;ref name = S1904 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==1905 season==
[[File:Tommy_Dowd.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Former [[St. Louis Browns|St. Louis Brown]] [[Tommy Dowd (baseball)|Tommy Dowd]] coached SLU in 1905]]
Long after transferring to St. Louis, Robinson maintained an unusually close relationship with his former team. He almost convinced the Badgers to make a last minute alteration to their schedule to play an extra game in 1905 ... at St. Louis on December 2.  The so-called "post-season" game was announced as all but a done deal by ''Post-Dispatch'' writer J. B. Sheridan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSln=Sheridan&amp;GSiman=1&amp;GScty=408530&amp;GSsr=121&amp;GRid=12842355&amp; John Brinsley Sheridan (1870-1930) Find A Grave Memorial]&lt;/ref&gt; Sheridan quoted St. Louis' Father Burke as saying, "Robinson, our crack [[Halfback (American football)|halfback]], who played with Wisconsin two years ago, is chiefly responsible for Wisconsin's willingness to play here.  He is in close touch with the athletic authorities at the Madison school and, knowing of their desire to play one more game this season, arranged the contest with St. Louis University."  1905 St. Louis Coach [[Tommy Dowd (baseball)|Tommy Dowd]]&lt;ref&gt;"Tommy Dowd Coaching", ''[[Los Angeles Herald]]'', October 23, 1905, Part II, Page 8; Former [[St. Louis Browns]] player [[Tommy Dowd (baseball)|Tommy Dowd]] was SLU's football coach for the 1905 season&lt;/ref&gt; said in the same article that the game was not "definitely arranged" and, in fact, it never happened.

Dowd coached the Blue and White to what was a disappointing 7-2 record in 1905, which led alumni to offer Dowd's predecessor, Martin Delaney, more than twice his previous salary,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/12402210/desire_delaney_at_st_louis_u/  "Desire Delaney at St. Louis U", ''St. Louis Post-Dispatch'', December 9, 1905, Page 6]&lt;/ref&gt; if he would return to St. Louis. But fate, and Robinson, had other plans.

==Eddie Cochems==
[[File:CochemsScrapbook.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A photograph of [[Eddie Cochems]] from a page of Brad Robinson's scrapbook. Robinson has written: "Coach St L. U '06-'07-'08  A really great Football Coach + Player.  He is truly the &lt;u&gt;father&lt;/u&gt; of the new game."]]

Each preseason, back home in Wisconsin, Robinson was invited to work out with the Badgers and the development of the pass and possible pass plays continued at that venue. It was at Wisconsin between the 1904 and 1905 seasons that Robinson first met [[Eddie Cochems]], who had become an assistant coach with the Badgers under Curtis in 1904&lt;ref name="madison"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uwbadgers.com/sports/2015/8/21/GEN_2014010115.aspx|title=Madison Sports Hall of Fame|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; before spending the 1905 season as the head coach at Clemson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=GOOD COACHES SECURED FOR TEACHING FOOTBALL|newspaper=The Atlanta Constitution |date=1905-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson recalled, "What I saw at Wisconsin before returning to St. Louis to school convinced me that Edward B. Cochems had an outstanding football system for that time. Actually years ahead of most of the other coaches of that period."

According to Frank Acker,&lt;ref&gt;"New Football Captain Elected", ''[[Los Angeles Herald]]'', page 9, March 28, 1905 {{cite web |url=http://cbsrfs.ucr.edu/batches/batch_ca_20070522_oasis/sn85042462/0017504727A/1905032801/0454.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218043415/http://cbsrfs.ucr.edu/batches/batch_ca_20070522_oasis/sn85042462/0017504727A/1905032801/0454.pdf |archivedate=2008-12-18 |df= }}; Acker originally played football at the University of Southern California and was elected team captain in 1905.

An unidentified St. Louis sportswriter of the period reported that some feared Robinson might return to Wisconsin to play with Cochems there. "(Robinson) played with Wisconsin two years ago, and might have filled one of the positions in the back field this year if he had not promised to return to the St. Louis University. "He received several requests from [[Phil King (coach)|Phil King]] (who had resumed his position as Wisconsin's head coach) to return to Madison and play on the Badgers, but would not desert his teammates in St. Louis."

Robinson simply could not break his word. So, if he wanted to play in Cochems' "outstanding football system", Robinson would have to bring the 29-year-old coach to St. Louis ... so that is exactly what he set out to do.

==1906: The forward pass is legalized and Cochems is hired by SLU==
The pass was officially legalized in the spring of 1906 by the newly created [[Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States]] (IAAUS), which became the [[NCAA]] in 1910. This was part of the plan to make the game safer that had been undertaken at the behest of President Roosevelt.&lt;ref name="WashPost-1906-1-28"&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=New Football Rules: Radical Changes Are Tentatively Adopted |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/access/251732852.html?dids=251732852:251732852&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=JAN+28%2C+1906&amp;author=Special+to+The+Washington+Post.&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post&amp;desc=NEW+FOOTBALL+RULES |format= |work=[[Washington Post]] |publisher= |pages= |page=S1 |date=1906-01-28 |accessdate=2008-02-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson wrote:

==The first pass==

[[File:1909_Photo_portrait_of_William_John_"Jack"_Schneider.png|thumb|right|210px|Jack Schneider c. 1909]]
Some 20 miles from the Lake Beulah training camp, on September 5, 1906, Robinson threw the first pass in a game against [[Carroll University#Athletics|Carroll College]] at [[Waukesha, Wisconsin]].&lt;ref&gt;Boyles, Bob and Guido, Paul, ''50 Years of College Football'', page 23, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Jack Schneider]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=62IWAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0#PPA92,M1 Creighton University School of Law, Creighton University, ''The Creighton Brief'', page 92, 1909] William J. Schneider came to St. Louis with Cochems from Wisconsin and later became football coach and athletic director at Creighton.&lt;/ref&gt; was the receiver for the Blue &amp; White (St. Louis would not adopt "[[Billiken]]s" as a [[Athletic nickname|nickname]] for its sports teams until sometime after 1910).

According to archives at St. Louis, Cochems (pronounced coke-ems)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slu.edu/readstory/more/7166|title=St. Louis University Article on Centennial of Forward Pass|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; didn't start calling pass plays in the Carroll game until after he had grown frustrated with the failure of his offense to move the ball on the ground.

The first Robinson-to-Schneider attempt failed to connect. More than 100 years later, Stephen Jones of ''[[The Press-Enterprise]]'' called it "an incompletion that changed the game of football forever."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pe.com/sports/other/stories/PE_Sports_Local_S_ncaafootball_review_20.47a51c1.html Jones, Stephen, "NCAA Football 09' video game has few changes", ''The Press-Enterprise'', August 21, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; Under the rules at that time, an incomplete pass resulted in a [[Turnover (football)|turnover]] to Carroll.

Undeterred, on a subsequent possession, Cochems called for his team to again execute the play he dubbed the "air attack". Robinson took the fat, [[Rugby football|rugby]]-style ball and threw a 20-yard [[touchdown]] pass to Schneider. Interviewed in a [[Jacksonville, Florida]] hospital room in 1956, Schneider remembered that first pass reception 50 years earlier.

{{quote&gt;We were in the second half and the game was tied when Robinson called the pass. Actually Robinson was an end and I was a fullback. But Brad could throw the ball a long way, so we switched positions for that one play.

We were told to run after the snap and just keep going until we heard the passer yell 'hike' or our name. So, I ran and ran. I was about to give up when I heard Robinson call. I turned and caught the ball a yard or so short of the goal and went over with it.&lt;ref&gt;"Football by Bob Broeg", ''St. Louis Post-Dispatch'', Page 35, Dec 7, 1956&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The play stunned the fans and the Carroll players. St. Louis went on to win, 22–0.

==Taking full advantage of the new rules==
The 1906 Blue &amp; White squad built its offensive strategy around "the new rules."&lt;ref name=vahe1&gt;[http://nahtmmm.livejournal.com/99821.html Gregorian, Vahe, "100 years of Forward Passing; SLU Was the Pioneer", ''St. Louis Post-Dispatch'', September 4, 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822231037/http://nahtmmm.livejournal.com/99821.html |date=August 22, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After returning to St. Louis, Cochems drilled his players relentlessly in long evening practice sessions "behind closed gates ... in absolute secrecy" according to one contemporary newspaper account.

Robinson and the tall and speedy Schneider practiced running "pass routes." Their passes were not the awkward heaves typical of the era, but overhand spirals that hit the receiver in stride.  They invented their own drills to develop the new skills they would need. Dr. Todd recalled, "[[Clarence Kenney|Pike Kenney]], Robinson and Schneider got together and began to work on the pass and soon developed amazing proficiency.  Robinson and Schneider used to run the side lines throwing the ball clear across the field as they ran."&lt;ref name = SLP1/&gt;

"Another Cochemesque feature of the practice," according to columnist Dan Dillon, "was his placing his two star forward pass artists — Robinson and Schneider — in front of the big score board in center field (at Sportsman's Park)."&lt;ref name = SLPPP&gt;{{cite news |title=Cochems Puzzles While He Pleases |author= Dan Dillon |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/14729173/cochems_puzzles_while_he_pleases_st/ |newspaper=[[Saint Louis Post-Dispatch]] |date=October 24, 1906 |accessdate=October 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;    Writing on October 24, 1906, Dillon was astonished that the pair "actually pitch the oval much after [the] baseball idea at certain marked spots on the board.  The accuracy exhibited by those men in throwing the ball was simply marvelous and if some of the Eastern critics who are reputed opposed to the baseball throw for the forward pass could see this pair execute the play it is certain they would change their views."&lt;ref name = SLPPP /&gt;

Frank Acker, who had moved from Wisconsin to St. Louis with Cochems and Schneider, explained the impact of the 1906 rules in an interview with Wray&lt;ref name = SLP2&gt;{{cite news |title=Wray's Column |author= John Edward Wray|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/14727117/wrays_column_acker_interview/|newspaper=[[Saint Louis Post-Dispatch]] |date=September 20, 1945 |accessdate=October 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in September 1945:

{{quote&gt;The passer then had to run five yards to the right or left of center before passing and as a result the field was marked off in five-yard squares, like a checker board, and not merely with parallel lines 10 yards apart.

The most important difference in the rules was that an incomplete forward pass was not brought back to the point of origin, but went to the enemy at the point where it grounded.  The effect was, on the fourth down, the same as if the ball had been punted.

If the St. Louis U. receiver caught it, he could run for that touchdown. If he muffed, the ball went to the foe some 40 yards or more from the point it was thrown ... Wouldn't that do things, today?&lt;ref name = SLP2 /&gt;}}

By the time of the interview, Acker was, according to Wray, "a stocky, broad-shouldered 59-year old guy" ... a retired Southern California physician and real estate investor.  But even 39 years distant, the memories of those early days of college football were fresh.&lt;ref name = SLP2 /&gt;

{{quote&gt;Robinson threw the long passes and Schneider the bullet-fast short ones. Robbie's shots were so dangerous that the opposition assigned three men to take care of him.

We ran our plays from the T formation ... Our opponents' attention to Robbie made things easy for us ... When Robbie started a play three of our backs went in one direction ... But the ball was passed to me direct and I went in the other, with no interference, usually hitting a hole in the line.

I am a football fan and see all the big games but I've never seen longer or more accurate passing than the Robinson-Schneider team showed me ... It should be remembered that they used a bigger and fatter football, harder to grasp, and offering greater air resistance than the narrower "projectile" of today ... I'd back Robinson against any of the pitchers today, big ball and all.&lt;ref name = SLP2 /&gt;}}

===Men on a mission===
[[File:RobinsonThrowing2.jpg|thumb|left|270px|Brad Robinson demonstrating "Overhand spiral—fingers on lacing" in "The Forward Pass and On-Side Kick" an article in Spalding's ''How to Play Foot Ball'', American Sports Publishing, Revised 1907 edition, written by Eddie Cochems, Walter Camp, Editor]]
Cochems and his charges took it upon themselves to convert the football world to their belief that the forward pass had fundamentally changed the sport.

In an early November 1906 newspaper interview, Cochems' enthusiasm was evident. "I think the forward pass is sensational. My men never think of throwing the ball underhand.  They throw it overhand as hard as they can."

"It's really a puzzle to me why the other teams are not given new style plays by their coaches," Cochems continued.  "[The] Eastern elevens are using nothing but the old-style formations ... It will be a matter of a season or two until the coaches throughout the country come around to my way of thinking or I will be badly mistaken."

Cochems was, in fact, badly mistaken. The power teams of the East, who dominated the attention of national sportswriters in the early 20th century, were slow to adopt the forward pass. It would be seven years before [[Knute Rockne]] began to follow Cochems' example at [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/sports/year_in_sports/11.01.html Cross, Harry, "Inventing the Forward Pass", November 1, 1913, reprinted in "This Day in Sports", ''The New York Times'', November 1, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; But, the slow adoption of his ideas was not for lack of promotional effort by Cochems.

The coach detailed his concepts in wires and letters to influential men in the sport.&lt;ref name= vahe1 /&gt;

Cochems wrote a 10-page article entitled "The Forward Pass and [[Onside kick|On-Side Kick]]" for the 1907 edition of Spalding's ''How to Play Foot Ball'', edited by the "Father of American Football", [[Walter Camp]].  The coach explained in words and photographs (of Robinson) how the forward pass could be thrown and how passing skills could be developed.  "[T]he necessary brevity of this article will not permit ... a detailed discussion of the forward pass," Cochems lamented. "Should I begin to explain the different plays in which the pass ... could figure, I would invite myself to an endless task."&lt;ref&gt;[[Eddie Cochems|Cochems, Eddie]], "The Forward Pass and On-Side Kick", Spalding's ''How to Play Foot Ball''; [[Walter Camp|Camp, Walter]], editor, page 51, 1907&lt;/ref&gt;

The coach even urged the redesign of the football itself ... to make it better fit the passer's hand ... more aerodynamic ... in other words the football we know today.&lt;ref name= vahe2 &gt;Gregorian, Vahe, "Hall of Fame snubbed Cochems, Robinson", ''St. Louis Post-Dispatch'', page C8, September 4, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===A passing offense that "bewilders" opponents===
[[File:RobinsonThrowing.jpg|thumb|right|290px|St. Louis newspaper clipping of Brad Robinson throwing a forward pass, November 28, 1906, from an article previewing the game with Iowa the next afternoon]][[File:HackettPostGame.jpg|thumb|right|290px|Referee Hackett's analysis of St. Louis' passing game against Iowa, ''[[St. Louis Globe-Democrat]]'', written by Ed Wray, November 30, 1906]]
The fundamental change to the sport engendered by the introduction of the forward pass was manifest in St. Louis' 1906 Thanksgiving Day game at [[Sportsman's Park]], where the Blue and White hosted the [[Iowa Hawkeyes football|Iowa Hawkeyes]].  A year earlier on the same field, Iowa had humiliated St. Louis 31–0 (and Robinson had been carried off the field unconscious after a hard tackle).&lt;ref&gt;"Iowa Trails St. Louis University's Colors in the Dust", ''St. Louis Post-Dispatch'', November 24, 1905&lt;/ref&gt;

In a newspaper article published the morning of the game, an anonymous writer correctly predicted, "It is to that leader who has grasped the possibilities of the new rules ... that success may come ... Indications point to a style of attack on Iowa's part which is virtually that of last year." The analysis continued, "No team, unless absolutely preponderant in physical strength and speed can hope to win out against an eleven like St. Louis university ... On the other hand, St. Louis U will, in all probability, spring a variety of play that will do to the visitors what it has not failed to do to every other eleven that has played here — bewilder it." The prediction could not have been more on the mark; the 12,000 fans in attendance&lt;ref&gt;"First Touchdown Is Scored After Few Minutes of Play", ''St. Louis Post-Dispatch'', November 30, 1906&lt;/ref&gt; witnessed St. Louis crush the Hawkeyes 39–0.

===Historic demonstration of modern football===
[[College Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] coach [[David M. Nelson]] (1920–1991) considered the Iowa game to be of historic importance.  In his book ''The Anatomy of a Game: Football, the Rules, and the Men Who Made the Game'', Nelson writes that "eight passes were completed in ten attempts for four touchdowns" that afternoon.  "The average flight distance of the passes was twenty yards."&lt;ref name= nelson1&gt;
{{cite book|title=The Anatomy of a Game: Football, the Rules, and the Men Who Made the Game|first=David M.|last=Nelson|publisher=University of Delaware Press|year=1994|isbn=0-87413-455-2}}, [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0874134552&amp;id=OmwfnipKuogC&amp;pg=PA156&amp;lpg=PA156&amp;sig=yv9laEI7tvftp9CUlkVCUkFRUSU p. 129]
&lt;/ref&gt;

Coach Nelson continues, "the last play demonstrated the dramatic effect that the forward pass was having on football.  St. Louis was on Iowa's thirty-five-yard line with a few seconds to play.  Timekeeper Walter McCormack walked onto the field to end the game when the ball was thrown twenty-five yards and caught on the dead run for a touchdown."

"Cochems said that the poor Iowa showing resulted from its use of the old style play and its failure to effectively use the forward pass", Nelson writes. "Iowa did attempt two [[basketball]]-style forward passes."  The morning after the game, Wray wrote that Iowa's "weak attempt ... at the forward pass ... was an utter failure."   On the other side of the ball, Wray observed, "Although Iowa seemed to know just when the (forward pass) was coming, the members of the Hawkeye team seemed to be unable to form a defense capable of stopping it.

"The use of the forward pass and the versatility of the St. Louis attack seemed to daze the Iowa team," Wray concluded.  "Nearly every one of the plays planned this season by Coach Cochems were unloaded in this, the last game of the season, and Iowa looked on enthralled but impotent."

===St. Louis' "perfect exhibition" of the passing game===
The 1906 Iowa game was refereed by one of the top football officials in the country ... [[West Point]]'s [[Horatio B. Hackett|Lt. H. B. "Stuffy" Hackett]].&lt;ref&gt;McCormick, Bart E. (editor), ''The Wisconsin alumni magazine'', Volume 28, Number 3, pages 108-109, January 1927&lt;/ref&gt; He had worked games involving the top Eastern powers that year and, just the Saturday before, had officiated in Chicago where [[Amos Alonzo Stagg|Coach Amos Alonzo Stagg's]] national defending champion [[Chicago Maroons football|Maroons]] thrashed [[1906 Nebraska Cornhuskers football team|Nebraska 38-5]]. Hackett had played the game himself, quarterbacking [[Army Cadets football|the Army Cadets]] to a 40-5 rout of [[Navy Midshipmen football|Navy]] in 1903. He was the first-ever winner of the Army Athletic Association Award. He would become a member of the American Intercollegiate Football Rules Committee in 1907&lt;ref&gt;''American Gymnasia and Athletic Record'', Volume IV, No. 5, Whole Number 41, page 62, January 1908&lt;/ref&gt; and be prominent in the game for the next three decades. Hackett was thus uniquely qualified to compare St. Louis' passing game with what everyone else in the country was doing in 1906.  He was quoted the next day in Wray's ''Globe-Democrat'' article: "It was the most perfect exhibition ... of the new rules ... that I have seen all season and much better than that of Yale and Harvard.  St. Louis' style of pass differs entirely from that in use in the east. ... The St. Louis university players shoot the ball hard and accurately to the man who is to receive it ... The fast throw by St. Louis enables the receiving player to dodge the opposing players, and it struck me as being all but perfect."

Hackett's analysis was reprinted in newspapers across the country, and when it appeared in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', the headline screamed: "FORWARD PASS IN WEST – Lieut. Hackett Says St. Louis University Has Peer of Them All. – Says that Mound City Champions Showed Nearest Approach to Perfect Pass He Has Seen This Year."&lt;ref&gt;"FORWARD PASS IN WEST – Lieut. Hackett Says St. Louis University Has Peer of Them All. – Says that Mound City Champions Showed Nearest Approach to Perfect Pass He Has Seen This Year.", ''[[The Washington Post]]'' (District of Columbia), page 55, Dec 2, 1906&lt;/ref&gt;

Wray recalled the interview almost 40 years later: "Hackett told this writer that in no other game that he handled had he seen the forward pass as used by St. Louis U. nor such bewildering variations of it."&lt;ref&gt;Wray's Column, ''St. Louis Post-Dispatch'', January 9, 1946&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the November 19, 1932 ''[[Minneapolis Star]]'', Hackett, who officiated games into the 1930s,&lt;ref&gt;''Cornell Alumni News'', Volume 36, No. 4, page 44, October 19, 1933&lt;/ref&gt; once said of Robinson, "Whew, that chap is a wonder! He beats anything I ever saw.  He looks as though 40 yards is dead for him, and he's got accuracy with it."

Nelson, who served as the Secretary-Editor of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA's]] Football Rules Committee for 29 years, drives home the singular nature of St. Louis' pass attack: "During the 1906 season [Robinson] threw a sixty-seven yard pass ... and ... Schneider tossed a sixty-five yarder.  Considering the size, shape and weight of the ball, these were extraordinary passes."&lt;ref name = nelson1 /&gt;

Sports historian [[John Sayle Watterson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.press.jhu.edu/books/title_pages/1322.html|title=The Johns Hopkins University Press webpage on John Sayle Watterson|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; agreed. In his book, ''College Football: History, Spectacle, Controversy'', Watterson described Robinson's long pass as "truly a breathtaking achievement."&lt;ref&gt;Watterson, John Sayle, ''College Football: History, Spectacle, Controversy'', page 107, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Coach Stagg, who disputed St. Louis' leading role in developing the forward pass, pointed to Robinson's passing prowess as the real difference-maker: "It might be true that his passer, Robinson, could throw a longer spiral than anyone else for he was a gifted passer. However, Eddie Cochems was not the originator of the long spiral pass."&lt;ref&gt;"In the Huddle with Deke Houlgate", ''Amarillo Daily News'', September 29, 1948&lt;/ref&gt;

==="There's the pass, boy"===
[[File:Sportsman's Park 1907.jpg|thumb|right|290px|Sportsman's Park hosting a [[St. Louis Browns]] baseball game in 1907]]
Some credited Robinson with throwing an all-time record 87-yard missile to Schneider earlier that season in St. Louis' 34–2 win over [[Kansas Jayhawks football|Kansas]] before a crowd of 7,000&lt;ref&gt;"St. Louis U. Scores 12 Points in First Half of Great Game with Kansas", ''St. Louis Star-Chronicle'', November 3, 1906&lt;/ref&gt; at Sportsman's Park. The distance was not reported in contemporary newspaper accounts but the 1933 ''Spalding's Football Guide'' listed the throw as official ... 87 yards in the air from passer to receiver ... as the ''[[Ogden Standard-Examiner]]'' reported in its November 12, 1933 issue:

:[[Parke H. Davis]] (''Football Guide'' editor and pre-eminent football historian) still insists that the longest forward pass ever thrown in a football game traveled 87 yards ... it was from Bradbury Robinson to John Schneider ... and it helped St. Louis to beat Kansas in the merry year of 1906 ..."&lt;ref&gt;"Did You Know That:", ''[[Ogden Standard-Examiner]]'', page 11, November 12, 1933&lt;/ref&gt;

A detailed account of the play was given by ''[[New York Evening World]]'' sports editor and cartoonist [[Robert W. Edgren]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://strippersguide.blogspot.com/2006/09/ep-1939-robert-edgren-obituary.html Robert Edgren Obituary for ''[[Editor and Publisher]]'', 1939]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wingedfist.com/cartoon_gallery.html "Robert Edgren Cartoons from ''[[New York Evening World|The New York Evening World]]''", Winged Fist Organization]&lt;/ref&gt; as quoted by columnist [[Joseph "Roundy" Coughlin]] of the ''[[Wisconsin State Journal]]'' in 1934:

{{quote|St. Louis had a mighty good team in those days and in this particular game with Kansas, determined to go out on the field and push over a few touchdowns without using the forward pass, just to prove that they could do something besides toss the ball. They kept the ball down on the ground during the first half and rolled up a lead of two or three touchdowns.

This didn't sit very well with Kansas and one of their ends named Bruner who was playing opposite Robinson, thought he would get Robinson's goat. "I thought you could pass," he said. "I heard you were a passing team, but all you do is buck the line. Show us a pass; just show it to us once."
 
Robinson looked him in the eye and said they would pass soon enough, and more than that, he would tell Bruner when it was coming. With the ball on its own 25-yard line, first down, St. Louis called for a pass on the first down.  Robinson went back into punt formation and shouted to Bruner that they were going to show him the pass and to warn the rest of his team, because they were going to see something.

And they did!

Brad Robinson got hold of the ball, waited for Schneider to run down to the goal line (Robinson could take his time because Kansas had pulled all but five men in the backfield and these five were smothered by the St. Louis forwards) and then let fly. Nobody paid any attention to Scheider because he was so far away from the passer that such a throw seemed impossible. All the Kansas team could do then was to look skyward as the ball soared from one end of the field to the other, to plump into Fullback Schneider's arms on the goal line.

"There's the pass, boy," remarked Robinson. "How do you like it?"&lt;ref&gt;"Roundy Says", ''[[Wisconsin State Journal]]'', September 28, 1934&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', Edgren was "(e)ven tempered always, well informed in all sports and ... always told the truth ...",&lt;ref&gt;"Bob Edgren Dead; Noted Cartoonist - Former Sports Editor of ''The Evening World'' Here Stricken in California at 65", ''[[The New York Times]]'', September 11, 1939&lt;/ref&gt; lending credence to his account.

J. B. Sheridan's game summary the next day in the ''Post-Dispatch'' also indicates that St. Louis did not pass at all until well into the second half. His description of Robinson's long throw matched Edgren's account in many details, although there was no mention of verbal exchanges with Bruner.&lt;ref name= JBS /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;One pass in particular made by Robinson to Schneider, which resulted in a touchdown, was a marvel of distance, accuracy and result. Standing on the 40-yard line, Robinson waited long. Then he threw right in the goal mouth to Schneider, who was tackled instantly, but fell across the touch line for a score. It was a wonderful play. How they handled the clumsy football on the throw, just as if it were a baseball, surprised me.&lt;ref name= JBS&gt;{{cite news |title=St. Louis Beat Kansas, 34 to 2|author= J.B.

Dan Dillon's "How the Game Was Played" in the ''Post-Dispatch'' the next morning gave no yardage details but he wrote that, "(a)t this magnificent exhibition of the spectacular forward pass the crowd went wild and Kansas was plainly up in the air on account of the machine-like method with which it was executed for such material gains."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=How the Game Was Played |author= Dan Dillon|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/14730100/qbacks_hear_bradbury_robinsons_story/ |newspaper=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]] |date=November 4, 1906 |accessdate=October 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 15, 1947, the ''[[St. Louis Globe-Democrat|St. Louis Star and Times]]'' referred to the play as "a record that still stands."&lt;ref name= BNR87&gt;{{cite news |title=Q-Backs Hear Bradbury Robinson's Story of Forward Pass Beginning |author= |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/14730100/qbacks_hear_bradbury_robinsons_story/ |newspaper=[[St. Louis Star and Times]] |date=October 15, 1947 |accessdate=October 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Northwestern University]] football program from the same year lists the 87-yard pass as one of the "Record Scoring Plays of All Time."  It also credits "the late football chronicler Parke H. Davis" as its source.

Record-setting or not, Robinson's passing against the Jayhawkers impressed ''[[The Kansas City Times]]'' in a post-game analysis: "The forward pass was perhaps the most effective of (St. Louis') new plays which they used against Kansas.  This was started from the punting formation.  Robinson, an end, going back to pass the ball.  Instead of making the usual basket-ball throw of the oval, however, he shot it straight forward in the same manner as he would throw a baseball, and wonderful indeed was the speed and accuracy with which it would fall into the hands of the backs waiting down the field."

==="Huge and boney hands"===
Professor Watterson wrote that, "Robinson ended up using passes that ranged from thirty to more than forty yards with devastating efficiency".&lt;ref&gt;Watterson, John Sayle, ''College Football: History, Spectacle, Controversy'', page 106, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

In their book ''Coaching Football'', [[Super Bowl]]-winning player and coach [[Tom Flores]] and longtime coach Bob O'Connor report that "Robinson ... was credited with several 50-yard completions in 1906." &lt;ref&gt;Flores, Tom; O'Connor, Robert; ''Coaching Football: From Youth Leagues to the Pros'', page 49, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In the build-up to the 1906 game with Iowa, the ''Post-Dispatch'' reported that Robinson could "throw the oval 65 yards."&lt;ref&gt;"Forward Pass Will Be Employed Thursday", ''St. Louis Post-Dispatch'', November 28, 1906&lt;/ref&gt;

Coach Nelson related that some observers chalked up Robinson's passing prowess to an anatomical advantage. "St. Louis had a great passer in Brad Robinson," Nelson observed.  "He had huge and boney hands, which led other coaches in the area to conclude that it was not possible to excel as a passer without these attributes. Having a passer without huge, boney hands was reason enough not to have an aerial game."&lt;ref name= nelson2&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Robinson believed his physical advantage was the result of accident as well as genes.  He credited his uncanny ability to throw long and accurate passes in part to a crooked little finger on his throwing (right) hand that was the result of a childhood injury.  The misshapen pinkie helped impart a natural spiral to his tosses.

Reporters of the era also noted Robinson's disciplined preparation, in terms of his drills and workouts.  Even when Robinson was in his sixties, his right arm was much more heavily muscled than his left, a testament to years of repeated exercise and practice.[[File:The Official National Collegiate Athletic Association football guide.

===SLU 407 – Opponents 11===
The [[1906 Saint Louis Billikens football team|Blue &amp; White cruised to an 11-0 record in 1906]]. Cochems and company led the nation in scoring, collectively outscoring their opponents 407–11.

In an October 1947 "Wray's Column," the ''Post-Dispatch'' editor wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... the football world in general and the college and professional treasuries in particular are indebted to Cochems and Robinson and St. Louis University ... That's because the tremendous rise of gridiron interest everywhere can be traced directly of the Cochems–Robinson forward passing and to the improved spectacle it has made of this fine and manly game.&lt;ref name = SLPTT /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==1907 season==
SLU compiled a record of 7-3-1 in 1907 and was named Varsity-Trans-Mississippi Champion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=b_ESAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP7&amp;lpg=PP7&amp;q=Varsity-Trans-Mississippi#PPA31,M1 ''Phi Beta Pi Quarterly'', Volume V, Number I, page 31, January 1908]&lt;/ref&gt; The highlight of the season was a 34–0 thrashing of the [[Nebraska Cornhuskers]] on Thanksgiving Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cochems Wins Again|newspaper=Wisconsin State Journal|date=1907-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cochems introduced another innovation at St. Louis that season, having his team wear numbers on their uniforms to allow spectators to identify individual players. The move was called "a decided innovation" and was compared to the numbering of jockeys in horse racing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Football Players to Carry Numbers|newspaper=Galveston Daily News|date=1907-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Blue and White traveled to the West Coast for a Christmas Day game against [[Washington State Cougars football|Washington State College]],&lt;ref name=Pro&gt;{{cite news|title=WHOLE 'VARSITY TEAM CLASSED PROFESSIONAL: St. Louis University Players Blacklisted in the Middle West|newspaper=Nevada State Journal|date=1908-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; which St. Louis lost 11–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Washington State 1907 season|publisher=College Football Data Warehouse|url=http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/coaching/alltime_coach_game_by_game.php?coachid=148&amp;year=1907}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the conclusion of the season, and even though most of his team consisted of medical students like Robinson and Schneider, charges were made that Cochems was using professional players. Several Midwestern universities, including [[Kansas Jayhawks football|Kansas]], [[Missouri Tigers football|Missouri]], [[Iowa Hawkeyes football|Iowa]] and [[Wisconsin Badgers football|Wisconsin]], refused to schedule games with St. Louis for the 1908 season, "claiming the team is tainted with professionals."&lt;ref name=Pro /&gt;

==The first triple threat==
[[File:RobinsonPunting.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''St. Louis Post-Dispatch'', November 17, 1905]]Brad Robinson was not only St. Louis' premier passer.  He was also the Blue &amp; White's principal kicker. One sports journalist of the time opined that, "of the local kickers, Robinson of St. Louis easily excels all others. He is good for at least 45 yards every time he puts his toe to the ball and some of his [[Punt (gridiron football)|punts]] have gone 60 yards."

Watching a St. Louis practice in 1906, journalist Dillon observed Robinson "kicking in fine form and with a slight wind behind him, was dropping them over regularly from the 45-yard line and was averaging close to 50 yards on his punts."&lt;ref name = SLPPP /&gt;

Robby's prowess as a ballcarrier was particularly noted by a reporter after a November 11, 1904 victory over the [[University of Missouri]] at [[Columbia, Missouri|Columbia]]: "Robinson and (John) Kinney, the halfbacks of the visiting team were the fastest seen here in years and the Tigers seemed unable to stop them."  Another writer at the game observed that Robinson's "offensive play was fast and in running back punts he gained much ground for his team, besides tackling well while on defensive."  The ''[[St. Louis Globe-Democrat]]'' added, "Robinson's return of punts electrified the spectators time and time again.  He was always good for a gain of 20 yards or more."

Years before the term was commonly used by sportswriters, Bradbury Robinson had become the sport's first [[Triple threat man|triple threat]]. Writing in October 1947, Ed Wray declared that the title belonged to Robinson.

&lt;blockquote&gt;We believe that Robinson also was the first triple-threat man in history because throughout the [1906] season Cochems used Robinson to pass, kick and run the ball ... He was an A1 punter, too ... And run! ... This three way use of Robby added greatly to the team's offensive deception."&lt;ref name = SLPTT&gt;{{cite news |title=Wray's Column |author= John Edward Wray|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/14729645/wrays_column_robinson_the_first/|newspaper=[[Saint Louis Post-Dispatch]] |date=October 14, 1947 |accessdate=October 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==All-around athlete==
[[File:StLouisTrackTeam.jpg|thumb|right|300px|St. Louis U's 1906–07 champion relay team (left to right): [[Clarence Kenney|Clarence "Pike" Kenney]], Martin McMorrow, Bill Clancy, Robinson and Schneider]]
In addition to his exploits on the football field, Robinson was also a standout in [[baseball]] and [[track and field]] for the Blue &amp; White, and was elected captain of both teams.

Upon his election as captain of the 1907 baseball team, the ''Post-Dispatch'' reported that

{{quote|Robinson has demonstrated, since his entrance at the blue and white school, that he is a good all-around athlete.  He played an excellent game at end for Cochems' eleven and did all the kicking for that team.  His punting was consistent and proved a very valuable asset to the blue and white eleven.  Aside from this, Robinson won recognition for his work in negotiating the famous forward pass, which gained favor every time it was employed.  He throws the ball virtually as far as he kicks it, and astounded many of the eastern enthusiasts by his work in this regard.

He is a clever fielder and one of the hardest hitters on the varsity team.  He also led the batters in the Bank Clerks' league, in which organization he played after the close of the collegiate season last year.

He is a good hurdler and at present is pushing Schneider hard for the supremacy in this event at the [[Jesuit]] school.  He was captain of the track team last year.}}

At the time of Robinson's election as track captain, a local writer reported:

{{quote|Immediately before the dual meet with Central [[YMCA|Y.M.C.A.]] Saturday night, Robinson, the half back of the St. Louis rugby team last year, was chosen captain of the track team.  Robinson's work on the track has been gilt-edged this season and his election to head the athletes was not a surprise.

That Robinson is a competent and loyal man to fill this position was evidenced by the manner in which he conducted himself Saturday evening.

He took first in the shot-put and ran almost a dead heat with Clancy in the hurdles, taking second place.  When his school was short a man in the mile, owing to the sickness of Trotter, he entered the race, although he had not (run) in a long distance race before. He finished fifth.}}

Despite his own admirable performance, Robinson's team was not a winner that night ... a loss he attributed to "overconfidence" and "poor luck." "Murray, the crack dash man, was left at his mark owing to the poor service of the pistol," Robinson explained after the meet.  "The gun failed to go off three times in succession and when the report finally came it took most of the men unaware and the heat was run in slow time."

In both 1906 and 1907 Robinson and his teammates were the Western [[Amateur Athletic Union|AAU]] Indoor relay champions.

==Graduation, assistant SLU coach, early medical career==
[[File:1910StMarysHospitalRochesterMNcopyrightCarlAHolland.jpg|thumb|right|230 px| The Mayo Clinic's St. Mary's Hospital in 1910]] 
Robinson pursued pre-med studies at Wisconsin before enrolling as a medical student at Saint Louis in 1904, where he earned his bachelor of science and medical degrees in 1908.&lt;ref name = michigan /&gt; He was elected to lead SLU's chapter of the Chi Zeta Chi Medical Society (which merged with [[Phi Rho Sigma]] in 1929).&lt;ref&gt;"The Blue and White", Volume 1, 1907, Page 213&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phirhosigma.org|title=Phi Rho Sigma Medical Society|website=www.phirhosigma.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was a member of the [[Phi Beta Pi]]&lt;ref&gt;"The Blue and White", Volume 1, 1907, Page 221&lt;/ref&gt; "anti-fraternity" professional society.

After graduation, Robinson interned at a local hospital and served as Cochems' assistant coach the following fall,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Sports page|author= |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/14733838/robinson_assistant_coach_stl_1908/ |newspaper=[[Saint Louis Post-Dispatch]] |date=November 7, 1908|accessdate=October 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in what was the last year in St. Louis for them both. The Blue and White compiled a record of 7–2–1 in 1908, defeating the [[Arkansas Razorbacks]] (24–0), but losing to [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|Pitt]] (13–0) and to [[Jim Thorpe]] and [[Carlisle Indians football|the Carlisle Indian School]] (17–0).

Robinson then moved to [[Rochester, Minnesota]], where he practiced surgery at the [[Mayo Clinic|Mayo Clinic's]] St. Mary's Hospital&lt;ref name = michigan /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/saintmaryshospital/smhhistory.html|title=Minnesota Patient and Visitor Guide - Mayo Clinic Hospital, Saint Marys Campus|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the next two years.

After graduation, Brad Robinson, III, went into the advertising business.&lt;ref name = michigan /&gt; He also served as an analyst on college football broadcasts, one season being teamed with [[play-by-play]] man [[Ronald Reagan]].

===World War I service===
Upon the [[United States]]' entry into [[World War I]], Brad Robinson, Jr. enlisted and was sent to the First Officers Training Camp at [[Ft. Sheridan]]. There he won his commission as a captain of infantry on August 15, 1917. He was then assigned to the command of Company L, 340th Infantry Regiment of the [[85th Infantry Division (United States)|85th Division]]. He was sent overseas in July 1918.

In [[France]], he became an instructor at the Inter-Allied Tank School in [[Recloses]], until his battalion was ordered to the front on November 1, 1918, ten days before the [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|Armistice]].&lt;ref name = michigan /&gt;

After the war, Robinson elected to remain in France to pursue post-graduate work. He met Yvonne Marie Dewachter (1898–1966) in 1919 while both were students at the [[University of Bordeaux]].&lt;ref name = michigan /&gt; Dewachter was the elder daughter of one of Western Europe's leading merchants – and a renowned landscape painter – [[Louis Dewis|Louis Dewachter (''nom d'artiste'' Louis Dewis)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.louisdewis.com|title=The Dewis Collection - The Art of Louis Dewis|website=www.louisdewis.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Robinson spoke hardly a word of French, Yvonne Dewachter was fluent in English.&lt;ref name=AND&gt;Transcribed interviews with Andrée Dewachter Ottoz (1995–2001)&lt;/ref&gt; A courtship ensued and the couple were married on August 12, 1919 in [[Paris]], a month before Robinson received his discharge from the Army. They had seven children: Lois, Nadine, Richard, Janine, Yveline, Jacqueline and Corrine.&lt;ref name = michigan /&gt;

The growing family moved from one European city to another as Robinson continued clinical studies across the continent from 1920 to 1926, while serving as a surgeon on the staff of [[Hugh S. Cumming]], [[Surgeon General of the United States]].&lt;ref name = michigan /&gt; These included stays in [[Leeds]], [[Liverpool]], and [[London, England]]; [[Rotterdam, Holland]]; [[Antwerp, Belgium]]; [[Bordeaux]], [[Le Havre]], [[Nantes]], [[Paris]], and [[Poitiers, France]]; [[Edinburgh, Scotland]]; and [[Dublin, Ireland]].&lt;ref name = michigan /&gt;

Cumming had been ordered to Europe to study the sanitary conditions of the ports to prevent the introduction of disease into the United States by returning troops. He also inaugurated a plan for the medical inspection of immigrants abroad in the principal countries of origin.&lt;ref&gt;"Officials Act to Prevent Spread of Typhus in America", ''The News-Herald'' (Franklin, Pennsylvania), page 1, Feb 12, 1921&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson played a role in both programs. ''The New York Times'' reported his arrival in New York City for a visit to the States in 1922:

:One of the first-cabin passengers who arrived yesterday from [[Liverpool]] ... on the [[White Star Line|White Star]] liner ''[[RMS Adriatic (1907)|Adriatic]]'' was Dr. Bradbury N. Robinson of the [[United States Public Health Service]], who has been in [[England]] for two years assisting British officials at Liverpool and other ports in the examination of emigrants.  He said that fully 25 per cent of the emigrants leaving Liverpool while he was there had to be what he termed "disinfested." Those who came from [[Southern Europe]] were clean because they had passed through so many disinfecting stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=LINER ADRIATIC ARRIVES WITH 839 PASSENGERS; Dr. Robinson Returns From Immigration Inspection Mission-- Man Dies at Sea. |author= |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1922/11/05/107079194.pdf |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 5, 1922 |accessdate=October 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robinson and his family moved to the United States to stay in 1926, locating to [[St. Louis, Michigan]] in September of that year.&lt;ref name = michigan /&gt; He was drawn to the small city because of its natural mineral-rich water, which he believed would play an important role in his [[Naturopathy|naturopathic]] and [[Holistic medicine|holistic]] medical practice.&lt;ref name= FGBRN /&gt; A frequent author on medical matters, he opened the Robinson Clinic in St. Louis in 1935,&lt;ref name= FGBRN /&gt; where he stressed a natural diet, [[colon cleansing|cleansing]], [[Exercise physiology|exercise]] and [[obesity|weight control]].

===Warnings against the use of DDT===
In 1947, Robinson became one of the earliest to warn of the dangers of using the pesticide [[DDT]] in agriculture.&lt;ref name= FGBRN /&gt; This was a radical view at the time, especially in St. Louis, Michigan. Beginning in 1944, DDT had been researched and manufactured in St. Louis by the [[Michigan Chemical Corporation]], later purchased by [[Velsicol Chemical Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.velsicol.com/|title=Leading Chemical Company - Manufacture, Distribution &amp; Sales - Velsicol Chemical, LLC|first=Super|last=User|website=Leading Chemical Company - Manufacture, Distribution &amp; Sales - Velsicol Chemical, LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt; DDT had become an important part of the local economy.&lt;ref name= STLH&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stlouismi.com/1/stlouis/history_by_decades.asp|title=History by Decades|website=www.stlouismi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;...  perhaps the greatest danger from D.D.T. is that its extensive use in farm areas is most likely to upset the natural balances, not only killing beneficial insects in great number but by bringing about the death of fish, birds, and other forms of wild life either by their feeding on insects killed by D.D.T. or directly by ingesting the poison.&lt;ref name= DDT&gt;"A Nutritionist Ponders the D.D.T. Problem"; Robinson, MD, Brad N.; St. Louis, Michigan, Private Publication, 1947&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some 15 years passed before the dangers of DDT were the subject of [[Rachel Carson]]'s 1962 landmark book, ''[[Silent Spring]]''. DDT's use in agriculture was banned worldwide in the 1970s and 1980s.

The [[Gratiot County, Michigan|Gratiot County]] Landfill just outside St. Louis, in which some of the chemicals from the DDT-producing plant had been disposed, became an [[Environmental Protection Agency]] [[Superfund]] site in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scorecard.org/env-releases/land/site-desc-long.tcl?epa_id=MID980506281|title=Pollution Locator: Superfund: Site Description|website=www.scorecard.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The local population assumed the problem had been solved. But, in 1994, samples of the riverbed taken next to the former chemical plant site revealed that it was still 4% DDT. A local task force pressured the [[EPA]] into cleaning up the adjacent waterway, an effort that was still ongoing in 2017,&lt;ref name= STLH/&gt; 70 years after Dr. Robinson had published his warning.

==Civic life and politics==
He was a member of the [[Baptist]] church, a [[Knight Templar]], a 32nd degree [[Scottish Rite|Scottish Rite Mason]], a [[Knights of Pythias|Knight of Pythias]], an [[Odd Fellow]], and a post commander of the [[American Legion]].&lt;ref name = michigan /&gt;

Dr. Robinson was a Republican and attended [[Michigan Republican Party|state conventions of that party]]. He was twice elected mayor of St. Louis, Michigan, in 1931 and 1937.&lt;ref name = michigan /&gt;

==Death==
Robinson died at the Veterans Hospital in [[Bay Pines, Florida]] in 1949&lt;ref&gt;"Dr. Bradbury N. Robinson", ''The New York Times'', March 11, 1949&lt;/ref&gt;  from complications following routine surgery.  He was buried at [[Arlington National Cemetery]].

==Honors and recognition==
Robinson was inducted into the St. Louis Billiken Hall of Fame in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slubillikens.cstv.com/boosters/stlo-boosters-hof-members.html|title=SLUBillikens.com - The Official Athletics Website of Saint Louis University|website=slubillikens.cstv.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009, ''[[SI.com]]'' and ''[[Sports Illustrated Kids]]'' listed Cochems' development of the forward pass and Robinson's historic touchdown pass to Schneider as the first of 13 "Revolutionary Moments in Sports."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/multimedia/photo_gallery/1004/revolutionary.moments.in.sports/content.1.html|title=SI.com, "Revolutionary Moments in Sports: Eddie Cochems", 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sikids.com/photos/21997/revolutionary-moments-in-sports/1 SIKids.com, "Revolutionary Moments in Sports: Eddie Cochems", 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724152946/http://www.sikids.com/photos/21997/revolutionary-moments-in-sports/1 |date=2011-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2010, [[Complex (magazine)|''Complex'']] magazine recognized Robinson as the "Best Player" on the 1906 St. Louis squad, which the publication ranked among "The 50 Most Badass College Football Teams" in history, placing the Blue and White at 38th.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/sports/2009/12/the-50-most-badass-college-football-teams/|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130119164629/http://www.complex.com/sports/2009/12/the-50-most-badass-college-football-teams/|deadurl=yes|title=The 50 Most Badass College Football Teams - Complex|date=19 January 2013|archivedate=19 January 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://best.complex.com/lists/The-50-Most-Badass-College-Football-Teams/1906-saint-louis-university-billikens "The 50 Most Badass College Football Teams" - 38. 1906 St. Louis University, Complex.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100203041432/http://best.complex.com/lists/The-50-Most-Badass-College-Football-Teams/1906-saint-louis-university-billikens |date=2010-02-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Complex'' said it chose the teams based on "style, guts, amazing plays, and players and coaches that did things that just hadn't been done before."  In 2011, [[Amy Lamare]], writing on [[Bleacher Report]], named St. Louis' 1906 game at Carroll College one of "The 50 Most Historically Significant Games in College Football."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/816191-the-50-most-historically-significant-games-in-college-football/page/7|author=Amy Lamare|publisher=BleacherReport.com|title=The 50 Most Historically Significant Games in College Football|date=August 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Canada Stadium''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]:  אצטדיון קנדה) in [[Ramat HaSharon]] is the main [[tennis]] venue in [[Israel]] and is used mainly by the Israeli [[Israel Davis Cup team|Davis Cup]] and [[Israel Fed Cup team|Fed Cup]] teams.

==History==
Canada Stadium, seating 6,000 spectators, opened in 1977 on land that had been an old strawberry patch, which was given to the [[Israel Tennis Centers]] (ITC) by the government.[https://web.archive.org/web/20081206091156/http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1066544/index.htm]  It was part of an ITC project that included the opening of 13 other tennis centres in the country.  After the opening, floodlights were added to the court, so that play could continue into the night.

The stadium is the "main court" of the tennis centre at Ramat Hasharon, which is the biggest in the country.  A large number of up-and-coming Israeli tennis professionals regularly train at the centre, as well as some top-quality players.

==Future extension==
On December 20, 2007, it was announced that the capacity of the stadium would increase to around 9,000, by 2012. It is estimated that the total cost of the project will be around $4 million.  Also, a roof will be installed over the court, so that play will be able to continue in the event of rain.

'''Charles Lees''' {{Post-nominals|post-noms=[[Royal Scottish Academy|RSA]]}} (1800–20 February1880) was a Scottish [[portrait painter]] who also specialised in sporting and recreational subjects. 

==Life==

Lees was born in 1800 in [[Cupar]], [[Fife]], Scotland.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/3544063 Charles Lees]&lt;/ref&gt; He began his career in art training under the eminent Edinburgh [[Portrait painting|portrait painter]] [[Henry Raeburn|Sir Henry Raeburn]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He went to Rome for six months, and on return spent the majority of his working life in [[Edinburgh]], having his studio at 19 Scotland Street.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Lees also taught drawing.

In the 1830s ''Charles Lees, portrait painter'' is listed as living at 9 Elder Street in [[New Town, Edinburgh|Edinburgh's New Town]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digital.nls.uk/83400891|title=Edinburgh Post Office annual directory, 1832-1833|last=|first=|date=|website=National Library of Scotland|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in [[Edinburgh]] on 20 February 1880 and was buried with his wife Elizabeth Christie of Baberton, and their children, in [[Warriston Cemetery]]. The grave stands on the north side of the main east-west path in the upper section.

==Portrait painting to sporting and recreational subjects==
Charles Lees achieved initial renown as a [[portrait painter]], his accomplishments leading to his election to the [[Royal Scottish Academy]] in 1830.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He later served as the Academy's Treasurer.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
 
Lees is perhaps best known for his work specialising in sporting and recreational subjects, particularly [[golfing]] and [[curling]], to which he turned from the 1840s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/rsascottishart/artistbios/leesc.asp Charles Lees, 1800-1880]&lt;/ref&gt;

=="The Golfers"==

In 1847 Lees completed his depiction of the 1844 grand match at [[St Andrews golf course|St Andrews]] in an oil painting, ''The Golfers'', which has been cited as being "the most famous golfing work of art in the world." &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.linksgolfstandrews.com/product/the-golfers-oleograph-ltd-edition/|title=The Golfers (Oleograph Ltd Edition) {{!}} Links Golf St Andrews|work=Links Golf St Andrews|access-date=2018-01-19|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; It shows the annual autumn meeting of October 1844, the scene being set at the 'Ginger Beer Hole' on the [[Old Course at St Andrews]]. The match that Lees painted was between [[Sir David Baird, 2nd Baronet|Sir David Baird]] and [[Ralph Anstruther|Sir Ralph Anstruther]] of Balcaskie against Major Hugh Lyon Playfair of St Andrews and John Campbell, Esq. of Glensaddel. As a portrait painter Lees had painted the true likeness of the actual players and spectators, and a key survives naming them.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The original oil painting is owned by the [[Scottish National Portrait Gallery]]. An engraving was made by [[Charles Wagstaffe|Charles E. Wagstaffe]] (born 1808) from which prints were produced. In 2006 the National Galleries of Scotland produced a monograph on the painting: 'The Golfers', by P. Lewis and A. Howe. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Clutch performance''' in sports is the phenomenon of athletes under pressure, usually in the last minutes of a game, to summon strength, concentration and whatever else necessary to succeed, to perform well, and perhaps change the outcome of the game.  It occurs in basketball, hockey, football, [[esports]], and other sports.  The opposite is [[Choke (sports)|"choking"]]: failing to perform as needed, when under pressure.

It is a phenomenon that is studied in [[psychology]] and in the more specialized area of [[sport psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=J Sport Exerc Psychol. |date=October 2009 |volume=31 |issue=5 |pages=583–601 |author=M. Otten |title=Choking vs. clutch performance: a study of sport performance under pressure |pmid=20016110 |doi=10.1123/jsep.31.5.583}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term gained popularity due to repetitive use among sports commentators, particularly baseball announcers. Consequently, a portion of the academic literature is focused on baseball, more specifically on [[clutch hitting]], and addresses the academic issue of whether it exists or not.

== Causes ==
A great deal of the academic literature shows that is important for athletes to be able to control their anxiety if they are to produce peak performances&lt;ref name="′′Humara′′"&gt;Humara, M. (1999). [http://www.athleticinsight.com/Vol1Iss2/Cognitive_Behavioral_Anxiety.htm "The Relationship Between Anxiety and Performance: A Cognitive-Behavioral Perspective"]. Athletic Insight, 1(2).&lt;/ref&gt; in clutch moments.

=== Yerkes-Dodson Law ===
Early academic literature presents evidence for the clutch player in the [[Yerkes-Dodson Law]]. In this 1908 study, psychologists, [[Robert Yerkes]] and [[John Dillingham Dodson]], found that stress, or arousal (pressure), increases performance to an extent, but too much or too little stress causes a decline in performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yerkes | first1 = R. M. | last2 = Dodson | first2 = J. D. | year = 1908 | title = The relation of strength of stimulus to rapidity of habit-formation. J. Comp. Neurol. Psychol | url = | journal = Journal of Comparative Neurology and Psychology | volume = 18 | issue = 5| pages = 459–482 | doi = 10.1002/cne.920180503 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The level of pressure necessary for maximum efficiency increases due to task, with those tasks requiring endurance and stamina being completed with higher levels of arousal. A bell curve is often used to represent the relationship between pressure and performance as indicated by empirical evidence. The Yerkes-Dodson Law suggests that arousal has positive effects on cognitive processes such as motivation, attention, and concentration. In effect, an athlete should be able to play at an elevated level with adequate amount of pressure. Further research is necessary in order to more clearly define the effects of momentum on a player′s in-game performance.

=== Individual Zone of Optimal Functioning ===
The Yerkes-Dodson Law spurred further research into its direct application in [[athletics (physical culture)|athletics]]. As a result, Sport psychologist, Yuri L. Hanin, developed the Zone of Optimal Functioning theory, which states, ″In order for an athlete to perform to their highest capability, they must experience their preferred level of anxiety.″ Hanin used a sport-specific version of the [[State-Trait Anxiety Inventory]] to measure the cognitive and [[somatic anxiety]] levels of each player before his or her performance. Hanin determined that each player has a certain range of pre-performance anxiety which leads to optimal performance.&lt;ref name="′′Humara′′"/&gt; Hanin later postulates the functional relationship between emotions and optimal performance differs between each individual based on emotional factors, thus the revised version was called the Individual Zone of Optimal Functioning (IZOF). The newer model better accounts for ″the multidimensionality of emotional constructs″&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kamata | first1 = A. | last2 = Tenenbaum | first2 = G. | last3 = Hanin | first3 = Y. | year = 2002 | title = Determining the Individual Zone of Optimal Functioning by a Probabilistic Method | url = | journal = Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise | volume = 34 | issue = 5| page = 84 | doi = 10.1097/00005768-200205001-01782 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by accounting for both positive and negative affect in athletes prior to the beginning of the sporting event. The study confirmed the existence of an ″association of the intensity of pre-competition state anxiety to optimal athletic performance.″ 
&lt;blockquote&gt;A majority of elite athletes perform personalized pre-game rituals in order to mentally prepare themselves for gameplay. Players may revert to these rituals immediately before the clutch moment so as to stabilize cognitive and [somatic anxiety] in order to revert to their individual zone of optimal functioning. This type of [[self-control]] is what leads to the ability to excel in the clutch.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Cognitive behavioral therapy in sports ===
Hardy et al. (1996) researched the psychological preparation of elite athletes and found that "Cognitive-behavioral interventions are effective for the purposes of performance enhancement."&lt;ref&gt;Hardy, L., Jones, G., &amp; Gould, D. (1996).  Understanding Psychological Preparation for Sport: Theory and Practice of Elite Performers. Wiley, Chichester.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of cognitive-behavioral therapies have since been incorporated into the field of [[athletics (physical culture)|athletics]] in order to help athletes self-regulate their anxiety during sporting events. One of the most common techniques used is mental [[Mental image|visualization]]. Miguel Humara explains that ″Imagery and mental rehearsal of tasks are beneficial for the individual seeking to improve athletic performance. These tactics provide familiarity with the task at hand and also provide positive feedback of their imagined performance.″&lt;ref name="′′Humara′′"/&gt;   Mental visualization allows elite athletes, who are consciously aware of his or her abilities, to complete the task more naturally and with higher coordination. Players are able to boost self-confidence by picturing themselves taking the shot, hitting, throwing, or catching the ball, etc. before the play actually occurs. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The situation presented here is ideal when a stoppage of play, such as a timeout, occurs directly before the clutch moment. The timeout situation allows coaches to make adjustments and call plays uniquely designed for late-game situations. Players have often simulated and successfully completed multiple repetitions of the shot or play in practices throughout the season and preseason. In team sports, the previous exposure to the situation at hand, even if only simulated, allows the group to understand the plan and act cohesively when executing. On the individual level, mental visualization enables a player, before action even resumes, to focus on the mechanics and techniques necessary to achieve a favorable outcome. The player may consider situational factors, such as a specific angle and motion to utilize or a speed at which he or she must accelerate. For [[Kobe Bryant]], this may mean making sure that he extends his leg when shooting his signature fade away jumper.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Clutch situations are commonly defined from an offensive perspective, but clutch moments may also come in the form of defensive plays. Coaches of the defending team often use the tactic of calling one timeout immediately following another late-game timeout. The latter of the two is called after the players have entered into the playing area but before play resumes, allowing the coaching staff to see how the opposing team sets up their offense and giving them an opportunity to scheme a defensive tactic that gives their team the best opportunity to win. Teams then execute the gameplan and are sometimes able to make remarkable comebacks.
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the [[2016 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]], the [[Texas A&amp;M Aggies]] made an improbable comeback against the [[Northern Iowa Panthers]]. The Aggies’ defense forced four turnovers while their offense scored 14 points, all in less than 35 seconds. The 14-2 scoring run tied the game at the end of regulation, although the Aggies had only about a 1-in-3,333 chance of winning&lt;ref&gt;Paine, N. (2016). [http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-were-the-odds-of-texas-am-comeback-over-northern-iowa "Texas A&amp;M Pulled Off a 1-in-3,00 Comeback"]. FiveThirtyEight.&lt;/ref&gt; just 44 seconds of gameplay earlier. The game extended into double overtime where Texas A&amp;M claimed a 99-88 victory over Northern Iowa.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Statistical analysis ===
Statistical Analysis has vastly improved with the evolution of technology. Today, computer software allows statisticians to track, analyze, and compare a broad range of statistics, even in terms of specific game situations. Sports organizations, such as the [[National Football League]], have entire branches devoted to analytics. Sports analytic researchers use [[sports science]] to present data on optimal practice lengths and days of rests. During gameplay, they also communicate directly with the coaching staff to make game decisions based on present and potential situations, which can be especially important when determining the play call for the clutch play. Statistical analysis researchers are able to assess the current game situation given data from recent (within the same game) and historical (earlier in the season or in previous seasons) games. Researchers provide information pertaining to where specific players are most effective in a given situation, such as in the clutch. Therefore, they can provide coaches with empirical evidence for choosing certain plays and present them with the probability of alternative options. Statistical analysis helps to highlight the significance of clutch moments. [[ESPN]]'s ''Sport Science'' host, John Brenkus analyzes hundreds of moments, players, and performances in the world of sports. Players across a number of sports recreate sports circumstances in a lab-like setting. Sport Science simulates in-game situations in a lab-like setting and analyzes, from a scientific perspective, individual aspects of the player's performance, probability of success given the circumstances, and additional influencing factors.

[[Julius Pollux]] includes ''phaininda'' and ''harpastum'' in a list of ball games:
{{quote|text=''Phaininda'' takes its name from Phaenides, who first invented it, or from ''phenakizein'' (to deceive), because they show the ball to one man and then throw to another, contrary to expectation. It is likely that this is the same as the game with the small ball, which takes its name from ''harpazein'' (to snatch) and perhaps one would call the game with the soft ball by the same name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Julius Pollux|title=Onomasticon|chapter=9.105}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{defn|1= The situation in a bout when the opposing blades are not touching; opposite of engagement.}}

{{term|term= Advance }}
{{defn|1= The ‘advance’ is the basic forward movement. The [[footedness|front foot]] moves first, beginning by lifting the toes. Straighten the leg at the knee, pushing the heel out in front. Land on the heel, and then bring the back foot up to en garde stance. Also, the term advance is used in general for any movement forward by either step, cross, or ballestra.}}

{{term|term= Advance-Lunge }}
{{defn|1= An advance followed immediately by a lunge.&lt;ref name="basic"&gt;Charles Simonian, ''Basic Foil Fencing,'' Sixth edition, Glossary, pp 107-111, Kendall/Hunt  Dubuque Iowa, (1976)&lt;/ref&gt; The extension can occur before or during the advance, but always before the lunge. A good long-distance attack, especially in combination with Handwork. An Advance, followed by a lunge might have a tempo of 1-2---3, but an advance-lunge should have a tempo of 1--2-3.}}

{{term|term= Allez }}
{{defn|1= French for "go", command used to commence action in a match. (Sequence is "En garde! (Etes vous) prêts? Allez!" for male competitors; for females, "prêts" with a silent t and s is replaced by "prêtes" where the t is pronounced)}}

{{term|term= Appel |content= Appel }}
{{defn|1= Stamping the front foot to the ground, to produce a sound to distract or startle the opponent. This may be made during an advance, or directly from an en garde position. It may precede a lunge, or be used merely as a distraction. An appel is also sometimes called a 'half-Advance'. This action may also be used to halt a bout, often by stamping the trailing foot insistently.}}

{{term|term= Arrêt à bon temps }}
{{defn|1= see [[#Stop Hit]].}}

{{term|term= Assault }}
{{defn|1= A friendly combat between two fencers, where score may or may not be kept, and is generally not a part of any competition. Formerly, public exhibitions (spectator events) were often conducted as assaults, rather than as round-robin or direct-elimination events, especially with a few fencers. (See also [[#Bout]]).}}

{{term|term= Attack }}
{{defn|1= The initial offensive action made by extending the sword arm and continuously threatening the valid target of the opponent with the point (or blade at sabre).}}

{{term|term= Attaque au Fer }}
{{defn|1= An attack on the opponent's blade, e.g. beat, expulsion, pressure.}}

{{term|term= Avertissement }}

{{term|term= Backsword |content= [[Backsword]] }}
{{defn|1= A type of heavy sabre, generally single-edged with a ‘false edge’ down the top third of the back of the blade. Typified by a basket hilt. In use from the 16th to 20th centuries.}}

{{term|term= Balestra }}
{{defn|1= A footwork preparation, consisting of a jump forwards, immediately followed by a lunge. This is the definition found in the French national fencing glossary, though it is common in the English world for a balestra to refer to only a jump. Jumps are faster than a normal step, which helps change the rhythm and timing of moves. }}

{{term|term= Beat Parry }}
{{defn|1= deflecting the incoming attack with a sharp striking motion.}}

{{term|term= Beat }}
{{defn|1= A simple preparatory motion. A sharp controlled blow to the middle or 'weak' of the opponents blade, with the objective of provoking a reaction or creating an opening. The action should knock the opponent's blade aside or out of line.}}

{{term|term= Bind |content= [[prise de fer|Bind]] }}
{{defn|1= also Lie, [[prise de fer|Liement]]; An action in which one fencer forces the opponent's blade into the diagonally opposite line, (that is, from high line to low line on the opposite side, or vice versa) by taking it with the guard and forte of his own blade. See also [[#Transfer]].}}

{{term|term= Black Card }}
{{defn|1= A severe penalty. A black card is used to indicate the most serious offences in a fencing competition. The offending fencer is expelled immediately from the event or tournament, regardless of whether he or she had any prior warnings. A black card can also be used to expel a third party disrupting the match.}}

{{term|term= Body Cord }}
{{defn|1= The insulated wire that runs under a fencer's jacket, connecting the Electrical Competition weapon to the reel, and thence to the scoring machine. The body cord also connects to the lamé causing it to become conductive.}}

{{term|term= Bout }}
{{defn|1= An assault at which the score is kept. Usually refers to a match between two fencers in a competition. This is the term used in the US to generally denote any combat between fencers, replacing the terms ‘match’ and ‘assault’.}}

{{term|term= Broadsword |content= [[Broadsword]] }}
{{defn|1= A military sword and fencing weapon popular in the 18th-19th centuries, similar to a heavy sabre. Beginning only in the late 20th century, this term came to be inappropriately applied to almost any straight-bladed, double-edged, single-handed cutting sword,&lt;ref name="ARMA" /&gt; especially of the Medieval and Renaissance eras.}}

{{glossary end}}

== C ==
{{glossary}}

{{term|term= Ceding Parry }}
{{defn|1= A method of parrying an offensive action executed by prise-de-fer or in opposition. The defender rotates their blade around their opponent's during the final stages of the offensive action and thus deflects it from the target in the same line as the offensive action was directed. Cf. [[#Opposition]]. }}

{{term|term= Change of Engagement }}
{{defn|1= An engagement of the opponent's blade in the opposite line. Changes of engagement are sometimes performed to place one fencer's blade on the side of his/her opponent’s blade that he feels has an advantage, or could be just to fool with the opponent. Often, a bout with a left-handed fencer versus a right-handed will see both of them jockey for position with changes of engagements.}}

{{term|term= Compound Attack }}
{{defn|1= Also composed attack. An attack or riposte incorporating one or more feints to the opposite line that the action finishes in. A compound attack does not necessarily lose right of way during its execution; it just comprises more than one indirect action. Compound attacks are usually used to draw multiple reactions from an opponent, or against an opponent who uses complex parries. A counter-attack into a compound attack must hit a clear tempo ahead of the compound attack to be valid.}}

{{term|term= Compound-Riposte }}
{{defn|1= A riposte made with one or more feints. A riposte may incorporate disengages, beats, and so on, as long as it is a continuous attack.}}

{{term|term= Conversation }}
{{defn|1= The back-and-forth play of the blades in a fencing bout, composed of phrases (phrases d'armes) punctuated by gaps of no blade action.}}

{{term|term= Corps-à-corps }}
{{defn|1= (French "body-to-body") The action of two fencers coming into physical contact with one another with any portion of their bodies or hilts. This is illegal in foil and sabre bouts, and is cause for the Referee (Director) to halt the fencing action. In épée, it does not violate the spirit of the game, but contact may not be accompanied with any brutality or forcefulness (intentional or not).}}

{{term|term= Coulé }}
{{defn|1= Also graze, glisé, or glissade. An attack or feint that slides along the opponent's blade. In performing a sliding action along the opponent’s blade, it is generally the goal to establish leverage by moving forte against foible, or forte to forte.}}

{{term|term= Counter-Attack }}
{{defn|1= An attack made against, or into, an attack initiated by the opponent. In foil and sabre, a counter-attack does not have the right-of-way against the opponent’s initiated attack. Counter-attacking is a common tactic in épée, where one may gain a touch by hitting first, and avoiding the opponent’s attack. Counter-attacks, especially in épée, are often accompanied by an action on the blade (beat, opposition, prise-de-fer, transfer).}}

{{term|term= Counter-Beat }}
{{defn|1= Also Change-Beat. A beat that is preceded by a circle under the opponent's blade. This can provoke a reaction with a beat from an unexpected quarter.}}

{{term|term= Counter-Parry }}
{{defn|1= also circular parry. A parry that moves in a circle to end up in the same position in which it started. A counter-parry usually traps an attack coming in a different line, but in the same high/low line. Thus, Parry Counter-Six (circular outside high) is effective against attacks in the Four line (inside high).}}

{{term|term= Counter-Riposte }}
{{defn|1= A second, third, or further riposte in a fencing 'phrase' or encounter. A counter-riposte is the offensive action following the parry of any riposte. They are numbered so that the riposte is the offensive action following the parry of the attack, counterattack or renewal, the first counter-riposte is the offensive action following the parry of the riposte, the second counter-riposte follows the parry of the first counter-riposte, and so on.}}

{{term|term= Counter-time }}
{{defn|1= an attack that responds to the opponent's counter-attack, typically a riposte following the parry of the counter-attack.}}

{{term|term= Coup d'arrêt }}
{{defn|1= see [[#Stop Hit]].}}

{{term|term= Coupé }}
{{defn|1= also Cut-Over. Another indirect attack, being an attack or deception that passes around the opponent's tip. Following a feint, the blade is pulled up and over the opponent's parrying blade. In foil, this requires use of the fingers and wrist only, since moving the blade backwards at any time during this move invalidates the established right-of-way. Done in proper time, and with proper distance, with the point never being moved backwards, the cut-over retains right-of-way during its entire execution.}}

{{term|term= Croisé |content= [[prise de fer|Croisé]] {{anchor|Cross}} }}
{{defn|1= also Cross, semi-bind; an action in which one fencer forces the opponent's blade into the high or low line on the same side, by taking it with the guard and forte of his own blade. See also [[#Transfer]].}}

{{term|term= Cross Over }}
{{defn|1= An advance or retreat by crossing one leg over the other; see also [[#Pass Forward]] (passe' avant) and [[#Pass Backwards]] (passe arriere). In sabre, crossing the feet while moving forwards is prohibited.}}

{{term|term= Cut }}
{{defn|1= An attack made with the edge of the blade. Cuts, that is, attempts to hit with the edge, are only valid in sabre. It is not a chopping movement as those are used to transmit impulse which is advisable for point heavy weapons like axes and mazes only.}}

{{term|term= Debile or Debole }}
{{defn|1= See [[#Foible]].}}

{{term|term= Derobement }}
{{defn|1= An avoidance of an attempt to take the blade. A derobement is a reaction to the opponent’s attempt to entrap, beat, press or take the blade, in a circular, lateral, vertical or diagonal motion.}}

{{term|term= Detachment in a Parry }}
{{defn|1= A method of executing a riposte (or counter-riposte) by leaving contact with the opponent's blade. Cf. [[#Opposition]].}}

{{term|term= Direct }}
{{defn|1= an attack or riposte that finishes in the same line in which it was formed, with no feints out of that line.}}

{{term|term= Director }}
{{defn|1= ( also '''Directeur''')  The referee in a bout.  In foil and sabre, the director determines the priority of touches according to the rules of right of way; the director is also responsible for enforcing rules.  See [[#Referee]].}}

{{term|term= Disengage }}
{{defn|1= A type of feint. Disengages are usually executed in conjunction with an extension/attack, though technically, they are just a deception around the opponent’s blade. To use in an attack, feint an attack with an extension and avoid the opponent's attempt to parry or press your blade, using as small a circular motion as possible. Circle under the opponent's blade. The first extension must be a believable feint in order to draw a reaction. Be prepared to proceed forward with a straight attack if no parry response is forthcoming.}}

{{term|term= Displacement }}
{{defn|1= Moving the target to avoid an attack; dodging.}}

{{term|term= Double }}
{{defn|1= A double touch. In épée, two attacks that arrive within 40 ms of each other, resulting in a touch for both opponents. This time margin is handled by the scoring machines, which lock out any touches after the time limit.  In foil and saber double touches use right of way to determine who is awarded the touch.}}

{{term|term= Doublé }}
{{defn|1= a compound offensive action that describes a complete circle around the opponent's blade, and finishes in the opposite line. The full circle is done in reaction to the opponent’s attempt to parry the attack with one or more parries, generally circular in nature. An attempt to perform a doublé against an opponent who does ''not'' parry results in the attack running onto the opponent’s blade, and parrying itself. For a compound action deceiving lateral or semi-circular parries, see [[#One-Two]]}}

{{defn|1= An evasive move to dodge or sidestep the attacker’s attack, generally followed with an attack of your own.}}

{{term|term= Extension }}
{{defn|1= The simplest action of attacking. A simple offensive action, consisting of extending the weapon arm forward. The point should move in the smoothest possible line towards the target, without wavering. Excess motion can ruin the control needed for precise, consistent hits.}}

{{term|term= False attack }}
{{defn|1= an attack that is intended to miss or fall short, so as to produce a reaction from the opponent.}}

{{term|term= Feint }}
{{defn|1= An offensive movement resembling an attack in all but its continuance. It is an attack into one line with the intention of switching to another line before the attack is completed. A feint is intended to draw a reaction from an opponent. This is the ‘intention’, and the reaction is generally a parry, which can then be deceived.}}

{{term|term= Flèche |content= [[Flèche (fencing)|Flèche]] {{anchor|Fleche}} }}
{{defn|1= Flèche means 'arrow' in French. The rear leg is brought in front of the front leg and the fencer sprints past his/her opponent. This action is currently not allowed during sabre bouts, because the front and rear legs must not cross. In épée, a quick pass is essential, since the defending fencer is allowed one attack after the pass, so long as the defenders attack is in one action, with or without a parry, initiated before the pass is completed.}}

{{term|term= Flick }}
{{defn|1= A cut that lands with the point, often involving some whip of the foible of the blade to strike at a concealed target. In foil and épée, flick attacks often start out without the point directly threatening the target area, and comes in with a circular action, to allow the blade to bend at the end of the attack, placing the point on target, possibly by whipping past a parry.}}

{{term|term= Flunge }}
{{defn|1= A portmanteau of Fleche and Lunge&amp;nbsp;– a 'saber fleche'. Rather the fencer starts as if with a fleche, but ends with a hop, skipping past the opponent. The rear leg is not brought in front of the front leg to ensure compliance with the rules.}}

{{term|term= Foible }}
{{defn|1= The top third of the blade. This section of the blade is weaker in terms of leverage, and is used for beats, presses, and other motions where speed is needed and leverage is not crucial.
[[Image:Fencing foil valid surfaces.svg|thumb|120px|A foil fencer. Valid target (the torso) is in red.]]}}

{{term|term= Foil |content= [[Foil (fencing)|Foil]] }}
{{defn|1= A fencing weapon with rectangular cross-section blade and a small bell guard. More generally, any sword that has been buttoned or had its point turned back to render it less dangerous for practice.}}

{{term|term= Forte }}
{{defn|1= The  [[wikt:forte|forte]] ({{IPA-fr|fɔrt}}) is the bottom third of the blade, so named for the strength in leverage that it provides. Fencers should always perform parries with the forte and never hit opponents with it.}}

{{term|term= Forward Recovery }}
{{defn|1= A recovery from a lunge, performed by pulling the rear leg up into en garde, rather than pulling the front leg and body backwards. Can be used to gain ground on the opponent more secretly than a standard advance, and when used sparingly can surprise the opponent by changing the expected distance between fencers.}}

{{term|term= Jury }}
{{defn|1= The 4 officials, or ''''judges'''', who watch for hits in a dry fencing bout. The judges watch for hits on the fencer opposite their end of the strip. A judge acknowledges a hit by raising his or her hand, attracting the attention of the referee (or president of the jury). A judge cannot interpret the right-of-way (foil and sabre), only vote on the touches as described by the referee. In electronically scored foil bouts, hand-judges can be used to watch for a fencer who may be covering valid target area with the unarmed hand. The Jury is hardly used anymore due to the electric fencing and replays where the referee can watch again to see who made the touch.}}

In sabre, the lamé covers both arms, the torso from the shoulders to the waist, and the back. Sabreurs also wear a conductive glove cover, called a manchette on their weapon hand. The lamé is connected to the body cord with an alligator clip causing it to be conductive.}}

{{term|term= Line }}
{{defn|1= The main direction of an attack (e.g., high/low, inside/outside), often equated to the parry that must be made to deflect the attack; see also [[#Point-in-Line]].}}

{{term|term= Lines }}
{{defn|1= The means of referring to a position or area on a fencer’s body. The idea behind ‘lines’ is that the torso, as facing the viewer in ‘en garde’ is bisected both laterally and vertically. There are then four quadrants of the body. The quadrants which are above the lateral line are referred to as ‘high line,’ those below as ‘low line.’ The fencer's left-hand-side, referred to as chest, is the inside. The fencer's right-hand-side, referred to as flank, is the outside. The lower chest side quadrant is then referred to as 'inside low line.’ The common parries in foil and epée are: sixte (outside-high), quarte (inside-high), octave (outside-low), and septieme (inside-low). Angled (up-and-down) parries can also be used. In sabre, tierce replaces sixte to guard the inside-high line, quarte becomes more erect, seconde replace octave on the inside-low line, and prime replaces septieme. Quinte is used in sabre to protect the head.}}

{{term|term= Longsword |content= [[Longsword]] }}

{{term|term= Lunge |content= [[Lunge (fencing)|Lunge]] }}
{{defn|1= The most basic and common attacking movement in modern fencing. This description adheres basically to the French school of fencing, and describes the legwork involved. The actions of the hand/arm/blade are considered separately from this discussion. From en garde, push the front heel out by extending the front leg from the knee. Do not bend the front ankle, or lift up on the ball of the front foot. This means that the front foot must move forward prior to the body weight shifting forward. As the front leg extends, energetically push erect body forward with the rear leg. Rear arm extends during forward motion as a counterbalance. Land on the front heel and glide down into final position, with front shin perpendicular to the ground, and both heels on the floor. During this action, the torso should remain relatively erect, and not be thrown forward. Often, the back foot can be pulled along behind during an energetic lunge. It is important, and a fundamental characteristic of the lunge, to fully extend the back leg, obtaining full power from this spring-like extension. [[Aldo Nadi]], of the Italian school of fencing, wrote an extensive description of how the lunge should be executed.}}

The manchette is conducting up to but not exceeding the wrist area. It is worn in conjunction with a lamé.}}

{{term|term= Maraging steel |content= [[Maraging steel]] }}
{{defn|1= A special steel alloy used for making blades rated for international competition. Usually stronger and more durable than conventional carbon-steel blades, but more importantly, it tends to break less frequently than carbon-steel blades. This is because propagation of micro-cracks in the blade is approximately 10 times slower in maraging steel than in carbon-steel. It is a fencing urban myth that a maraging steel blade is designed to break flat; the breakage patterns are identical. Both maraging and non-maraging blades break with the same degree of jaggedness. The sole reason for requiring a maraging steel blade (or a non-maraging one that has the same longevity under FIE testing) is that fewer blade breaks means less potential for follow-on injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QmYEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=maraging+steel+blade+injury+fencing&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Kp9NTuuUGsi08QO75KGeBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=maraging%20steel%20blade%20injury%20fencing&amp;f=false|title=Popular Mechanics "Noncarbon steel in fencing weapons reduces the chances of breakage and injury."|date=July 1996|page=73|publisher=[[The Hearst Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{term|term= [[Parry (fencing)|Parry]] }}
{{defn|1= A simple defensive action designed to deflect an attack, performed with the forte of the blade. A parry is usually only wide enough to allow the attacker's blade to just miss; any additional motion is wasteful. A well-executed parry should take the foible of the attacker's blade with the forte and/or guard of the defender's. This provides the greatest control over the opponent's blade. In sabre, the guard should be turned appropriately using the fingers to protect the wrist.

Parries generally cover one of the 'lines' of the body.  The simplest parries move the blade in a straight line.  Other parries move the blade in a circular, semicircular, or diagonal manner.  There are eight basic parries, and many derivatives of these eight.  (see [[#Prime]], [[#Seconde]], [[#Tierce]], [[#Quarte]], [[#Quinte]], [[#Sixte]], [[#Septime]], [[#Octave]], [[#Neuvieme]]).  See also [[#Lines]].

In foil, the opponent's blade should not only be deflected away from the target, but away from off-target areas as well.  An attack that is deflected off the valid target but onto invalid target still retains right-of-way. In sabre, the opponent's blade need only be deflected away from valid target, since off-target touches do not stop the phrase.  Sabre parries must be particularly clean and clear to avoid the possibility of whip-over touches.  In épée, a good parry is simply any one that gains enough time for the riposte;  opposition parries and prise-de-fer are commonly used, since they do not release the opponent's blade to allow a remise.}}

{{defn|1= also Passe Avant, or cross forward. A forwards footwork action. The rear foot moves in front of forward foot on the body's inside. From the crossed position, the front foot moves forward into the ‘en garde’ stance. Note: Passing forward is illegal in sabre.}}

{{term|term= Patinando }}
{{defn|1= There are two types of patinandos, speed and tempo. They are advance lunges but with different tempos. The speed patinando is a fast step and a lunge, while the tempo patinando is a slow step (to get a slow response from one's opponent) and a fast lunge.}}

{{term|term= Passata-sotto }}
{{defn|1= An evasive action which is initiated by dropping a hand to the floor and lowering the body under the opponent's oncoming blade. Often accompanied by a straightening of the sword arm to attempt a hit on the opposing combatant.}}

{{term|term= Passé }}
{{defn|1= An attack that passes the target without hitting.}}

{{term|term= Pistol Grip |content= [[Pistol grip (fencing)|Pistol Grip]] {{anchor|Pistol grip}} }}
{{defn|1=  A modern, orthopedic grip, often shaped vaguely like a small pistol  (generally with more protrusions than a real pistol’s grip).  Varieties are known by names such as Belgian, German, Russian, and Visconti.  Orthopedic grips were introduced to aid a fencer who has lost some fingers and was unable to use a traditional grip.}}

{{term|term= Plastron }}
{{defn|1= Also Underarm Protector. A partial garment worn under the jacket for padding or for safety. Usually Consists of a sleeve and a chest/abdomen covering, which provides additional padding and protection. An 'underarm' plastron is seamless under the weapon arm, providing no weak seams for a broken blade to rip though. An ‘over-plastron’ is worn to provide additional padding.}}

{{term|term= Point }}
{{defn|1= In foil and épée, the point is the only part of the blade with which to score points. The point may also be used in sabre.}}

{{term|term= Point-in-Line }}
{{defn|1= An established threat made with the extended arm. A point-in-line is a static threat, created by one fencer by extending the weapon and arm prior to any actions in a phrase. In foil and sabre, a Point-in-line has right of way, therefore, if the line is not withdrawn, any attack launched by the opponent does not have right of way. This can be likened to a spear poking up from the ground: If you throw yourself upon it, you have only yourself to blame. A successful attack on the blade will invalidate a point-in-line or causing the opponent to withdraw his/her arm. In épée, Point-in-line has no right of way advantages, but is still an effective tactic.}}

{{term|term= Pommel }}
{{defn|1= From the old French word for 'apple'. This fastener affixes the grip and guard to the tang of the blade. It has female threading, but the threaded hole does not go all the way through as is the case with a nut. It is screwed onto the distal end of the tang, locking guard, grip and electric connector is position by compression and friction. The pommel traditionally acts as a counterweight on non-orthopedic grips of foils and épées, and on all sabres. In electric sabre, it is covered with plastic as to not interfere with the detection of valid hits by allowing stray currents. Orthopedic (pistol-grip) weapons use only a pommel nut, usually fitting inside a cylindrical hole in the grip.}}

{{term|term= Pomelling (Posting) }}
{{defn|1= A method of holding a weapon further down the handle in order to extend the reach by a few inches. Posting is a trade-off; the fencer loses a little control over their blade work in return for the longer reach. This is most commonly done using a [[french grip]] épée, where there is no need to establish right of way, and hitting first can result in being awarded the touch. Technically, it is not legal to slide one's hand on the grip from front to back during an offensive action (see FIE t.16), so a fencer who wishes to post must do it while the action is stopped, or risk a possible penalty.}}

{{term|term= Preparation }}
{{defn|1= Any action that precedes the actual launch of an attack. Preparation usually consists of actions against the opponents blade to take it out of line, or to provoke a reaction. In foil and sabre, any action that occurs during a phrase or conversation that precedes the establishment of right-of-way on the part of a fencer, often accompanied with a movement forward. In calling the actions in a foil or sabre bout, a referee may indicate preparation on the part of one fencer, meaning the fencer was moving forward without establishing right-of-way, and was vulnerable to an attack made during this time.}}

{{term|term= Presentation }}
{{defn|1= Offering one's blade for engagement by the opponent.}}

{{term|term= Press }}
{{defn|1= also Pressure. An attempt to push the opponent's blade aside or out of line from engaged blades. A press can precede a direct or indirect attack, depending on the opponent's reaction, but should be followed by an immediate threat (a full or partial extension). A press which is not followed by a threat may invite a disengage from the opponent, and an attack thereby. From an engagement, press smoothly on the opponent's foible, taking his/her blade out of line, and perhaps provoking a response. The thumb and fingers should provide the force behind this action.}}

{{term|term= Prêt }}
{{defn|1= French term for "ready." Used by the judge after the command 'en garde' and before the command 'allez.'}}

{{term|term= Prime }}
{{defn|1= Parry #1; blade down and to the inside, wrist pronated. The point is significantly lower than the hand. Covers the inside low-line (this is a rare sabre parry).}}

{{term|term= Priority }}
{{defn|1= In saber and foil, the rules that decide which fencer will be awarded the touch in the event that they both attack simultaneously; also used synonymously with right-of-way. }}
{{defn|2= In the 1995 revision of the rules for all weapons, priority also refers to rules dealing with a tie score.  Priority is awarded when time expires with a tied score. The priority is determined by the flip of a coin at the start of the last minute, and the winner of the toss wins the bout if the score is tied when time expires.}}

{{term|term= Prise de Fer |content= [[Prise de Fer]] }}
{{defn|1= (French : Literally take the steel); also “Taking the Blade”; an engagement of the blades that attempts to control the opponent's weapon. See also [[#Beat]], [[#Press]], [[#Expulsion]], [[#Bind]], [[#Croisé]], [[#Envelopment]], [[#Opposition]], [[#Transfer]].}}

{{term|term= Pronation }}
{{defn|1= The position of the hand when the palm is facing down. See [[#Supination]].}}

{{glossary end}}

== Q ==
{{glossary}}

{{term|term= Quarte }}
{{defn|1= Parry #4; blade up and to the inside, wrist supinated. The point is higher than the hand. Covers the inside high line.}}

{{term|term= Quillion }}
{{defn|1= also Quillon, Cross-guard. A bar that composes all or part of the guard of a sword. The quillions (usually two) extend from the hilt of the sword, perpendicular to the line of the blade, on the same plane as the edge(s) of the blade. In simple medieval swords, the quillions usually form the entire guard. In later, more complex hilts, rings and other protective structures were extended in front of the quillions. One or two fingers can be wrapped around the quillions, providing better control of the weapon. In modern fencing weapons, the Italian grip is the only one that retains quillions.}}

{{term|term= Quinte }}
{{defn|1= Parry #5; blade up and to the inside, wrist pronated. The point is higher than the hand. This parry, more than any other, is subject to different interpretations in different schools (in foil and épée). In foil and épée, this parry generally covers the inside high line, since the pronated wrist can push further down than the supinated wrist (in Quarte). If the point and hand are lifted, this parry can also cover the inside low line with a sweeping action upwards, carrying the opponents point over the outside shoulder. In sabre, the blade is held above the head to protect from head cuts, but should still point slightly forward ready for riposte.}}

{{glossary end}}

== R ==
{{glossary}}

{{term|term= Raddoppio }}
{{defn|1= (from ''raddoppio'', Italian, "double") Gaining on the lunge; that is, a lunge coupled with an advance.&lt;ref name="Whitman"&gt;Whitman College Fencing [http://www.acfencers.com/essentials.html Frequently Asked Questions] (Accessed December 5, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{term|term= Rapier |content= [[Rapier]] }}
{{defn|1= A long, double-edged thrusting sword popular in the 16th-17th centuries. Rapiers began as swords which were designed to use the point, in addition to heavy cuts. Some consider the ‘estoc’ a precursor to the rapier. As the styles of combat changed, and heavy armor was lightened, the rapier became more focused on the use of the point, and less on heavy cutting strokes. Hilts were designed to allow the forefinger to wrap around a quillion and provide better control. Hilts could be of complex 'swelp-hilt' design, or shaped like a deep cup.}}

{{term|term= Recovery }}
{{defn|1= A return to en garde stance from any other position, generally by pulling backwards into en garde. Recovery from a lunge occurs by reversing the motions in a lunge, and recovering the extended arm last of all. A forward recovery involves moving the rear foot forward to return to en garde. For a center recovery, both feet move towards the center simultaneously.}}

{{term|term= Red Card }}
{{defn|1= Used to indicate repeated minor rule infractions or a major rule infraction by one of the fencers; results in a point being given to the other fencer, and often the annulment of any touch which would have been made by the offending fencer.}}

{{term|term= Redoublement }}
{{defn|1= An additional offensive action made after a previous offensive action (attack, riposte, counterattack or renewal) has failed and made with some further blade action, such as feints and disengages. See also [[#Renewal]], [[#Remise]] and [[#Reprise]].}}

{{term|term= Referee }}
{{defn|1= also director, president. The mediator of the fencing bout.}}

{{term|term= Renewal }}
{{defn|1= An offensive action made immediately after a previous offensive action has missed or been parried. There are three types of renewal: the [[#Remise]] (direct), the [[#Redoublement]] (indirect or compound) and the [[#Reprise]] (made after returning to the en garde position).}}

{{term|term= Remise }}
{{defn|1= An immediate, direct replacement of an attack that missed, was short, or was parried, without withdrawing the arm. A remise is a direct continuation, meaning that no deceptions or changes of line occur with the continuation (replacement) of the attack. In foil and sabre, a remise does not have right of way over an immediate riposte. See also [[#Renewal]], [[#Reprise]] and [[#Redoublement]].}}

{{term|term= Reprise }}
{{defn|1= A new attack executed immediately after a return to the en garde position. Specifically, this most often refers to the movement of bringing up the back foot from the lunge and lunging again to renew the attack against an opponent who caused the initial attack to miss by retreating. A reprise may be direct, indirect, or compound. See also [[#Renewal]], [[#Remise]] and [[#Redoublement]].}}

{{term|term= Retreat }}
{{defn|1= The basic backwards movement. Rear foot reaches backwards and is firmly planted, then front leg pushes body weight backwards smoothly into 'en garde' stance.}}

{{term|term= Ricasso }}
{{defn|1= An unsharpened portion of the blade in front of the quillions. In complex rapier and smallsword hilts, the ricasso is behind the guard, or the forward portion of the hilt.}}

{{term|term= Right-of-Way }}
{{defn|1= The rules for awarding the point in the event of a double touch in foil or sabre. The concept involved in being the first to establish a valid threat to an opponent's target area. Extending is the usual means to establishing this threat. Breaking the extended arm during an attack means relinquishing right-of-way. An opponent can take right-of-way by parrying the opponents blade.}}

{{term|term= Riposte }}
{{defn|no=1|1= An attack made immediately after a parry of the opponent's attack.}}
{{defn|no=2|1= An attack with right-of-way following a valid parry. A simple (or direct) riposte goes straight from the parry position to the target. A riposte may attack in any line. Consider its equivalent in a conversation.}}

{{term|term= Sabre |content= [[Sabre (fencing)|Sabre]] }}
{{defn|1= A fencing weapon with a flat blade and knuckle guard, used with cutting or thrusting actions; a military sword popular in the 18th to 20th centuries; any cutting sword used by cavalry. The modern fencing sabre is descended from the dueling sabre of Italy and Germany, which was straight and thin with sharp edges, but had a blunt end.}}

{{term|term= Salle }}
{{defn|1= (French: "room") A fencing hall or club.}}

{{term|term= Salut des armes }}
{{defn|1= A sort of a choreographed demonstration of arms, consisting of sets of fencers saluting, attacking, parrying, drilling and performing set routines in chorus.}}

{{term|term= Salute }}
{{defn|no=1|1= A blade action performed before a bout or lesson. Indicates respect and good sportsmanship. A handshake is usually exchanged after a bout.}}
{{defn|no=2|1= A gesture of respect and civility performed with the weapon. Performed at the start and end of a bout (match, assault, etc.), and also at the start and end of a lesson. At the start of a bout, it is traditional, and expected, to salute the adversary, the referee of the bout, any additional judges for the bout, and then, optionally, others (the timekeeper, scorekeeper, etc.). The FIE rules now state that failure to salute an opponent and shake his/her hand at the end of a bout is an offense punishable by a black card - meaning elimination from the competition.}}

{{term|term= Second-Intention }}
{{defn|1= In general, a term used to imply that the first action initiated is ''not'' the one intended to score. The fencer may initiate a move, anticipating (or intending to draw) a certain response from the opponent, against which a second action is planned. For example, Lunge Attack (anticipating that it will be parried), Parry the riposte, and hit with a Counter-Riposte.}}

{{term|term= Seconde }}
{{defn|1= Parry #2; blade down and to the outside, wrist pronated. The point is significantly lower than the hand. Covers the outside low line in sabre, replacing octave.}}

{{term|term= Semicircular Parry }}
{{defn|1= A parry that moves from a high line to a low line, or vice versa. The parry can also cross the body. The parry must be made in a semicircle to provide the enveloping movement needed to trap the attacking blade.}}

{{term|term= Septime }}
{{defn|1= Parry #7; blade down and to the inside, wrist supinated. The point is lower than the hand. Covers the inside low line.}}

{{term|term= Simple }}
{{defn|1= An attack or riposte that involves no feints.}}

{{term|term= Simultaneous }}
{{defn|1= In foil and sabre, two attacks for which the right-of-way is too close to determine.}}

{{term|term= Sixte }}
{{defn|1= Parry #6; blade up and to the outside, wrist supinated. The point is higher than the hand. Covers the outside high line. This is generally the parry taught as the basic en garde position in foil and épée.}}

{{term|term= Smallsword |content= [[Smallsword]] }}
{{defn|1= Also court sword. A light dueling sword popular in the 18th century. These were, as often as not, a fashion accessory as much as a gentleman’s weapon, and were decorated as such.}}

{{term|term= Stop Hit |content= Stop Hit {{anchor|Stop Cut}} }}
{{defn|1= also Stop Thrust, Stop-in-Time. A counter-attack that attempts to take advantage of an uncertain attack. A properly performed Stop Hit allows a fencer to counter-attack into an oncoming attack, hit his opponent, and then still parry the oncoming attack (allowing a possible valid riposte as well). It may try to break the continuance of an attack by 'stopping' into it. However, it is still a Counter-attack, and does not have Right-of-Way against a continuous attack.}}

{{term|term= Strip |content= [[Piste (fencing)|Strip (Piste)]] {{anchor|Piste}} }}
{{defn|1= The fencing area, 14 metres long and between 1.5 and 2 metres wide. The last two metres on each end is hash-marked, to warn a fencer before he/she backs off the end of the strip. Retreating off the end of the strip with both feet gets a touch against. Going off the side of the strip with one foot or both halts the fencing action and gets a penalty of the loss of one metre. Going off the back of the piste with both feet results in a hit being awarded to the opponent. After each touch, fencers begin again at the center of the strip, 4 metres apart.}}

{{term|term= Supination }}
{{defn|1= The position of the hand when the palm is facing up. See [[#Pronation]].}}

{{term|term= Target Area }}
{{defn|1= The area delimited for valid hits in that weapon. Foil target area consists of the entire torso, including the groin and the bottom of the mask which covers the lame, and down to the waist in back. Head, arms and legs are considered off-target in foil. Épée uses the entire body for target. Sabre uses all the body area above the waist, except the hands and the back of the head.}}

{{term|term= Third Intention }}
{{defn|1= There is first intention which is a simple attack or thrust. There is second intention in which the attacker seeks to deceive their opponent before the actual thrust. Third intention goes further with two or more actions intended to deceive or place the defender in a position favorable to the attacker. Aldo Nadi stated in his book "On Fencing" that "The great fencer uses the latter (2nd intention) predominantly, exploiting their value and comparative safety to the utmost. But this is not all. Against intelligent adversaries, he frequently uses the third and even the fourth intention"&lt;ref&gt;Aldo Nadi "On Fencing"&lt;/ref&gt; }}

{{defn|1= In sabre, a touch that results from the foible of the blade whipping over the opponent's guard or blade when parried. Whip-overs are usually not counted, and formerly were a way of saying that even though the blade hit, it was parried prior to body contact, and was not valid. However, with the advent of electric sabre, whip-overs are being allowed more often.

==Historical and foreign fencing terminology==
Note that the vocabulary here is primarily a glossary of modern fencing terms.  Over time, the teminology has evolved, and different terminology may be found in Medieval and Renaissance sources.&lt;ref name="ARMA"&gt;Association for Renaissance Martial Arts (ARMA),  [http://www.thearma.org/terms.htm Historical Fencing Terminology] (accessed 5 December 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;  In many cases, English, French, and Italian terminology may be used (often interchangeably) for the same thing.&lt;ref name="Whitman" /&gt; It should also be noted that American and British English differ in several points of fencing terminology, though some effort has been made in this article to indicate both conventions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1901">The [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Team handball|handball]] league is divided into divisions.  The top teams play in the Liga ASOBAL. In each division, a team plays all other teams twice, once at home and once away.

The Spanish league teams compete in [[Europe]] under the [[European Handball Federation]], most notably in the [[EHF Champions League]].  The teams also compete in a domestic cup competition each year, called the [[Copa del Rey de Balonmano|Copa del Rey]]. The winners of the Liga ASOBAL play the winners of the Copa del Rey in the [[Supercopa ASOBAL]] (Super Cup).

==History==

===Brazil===
[[Richarlyson Barbosa Felisbino|Richarlyson]] was named on Brazilian television as a homosexual by the manager of a rival team. When Richarlyson undertook legal action, the complaint was thrown out by the judge, who stated "football was a virile masculine sport and not a homosexual one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/6930806.stm|title=Brazil judge in gay football row|accessdate=12 August 2009|date=4 August 2007|author=Gary Duffy|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bulgaria===
In 2006, [[PFC Levski Sofia]] president [[Todor Batkov]] felt it acceptable to call referee [[Mike Riley (referee)|Mike Riley]] a "British homosexual", following Riley's controversial sending off of [[Cedric Bardon]] during the [[UEFA Cup]] quarterfinal game against [[Schalke 04]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/wire?section=soccer&amp;id=2391793|title=Levski Sofia to appeal against Bardon red card|date=31 Mar 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gulfweekly.com/Articles.aspx?articleid=20026|title=The life of Riley... red cards and all|date=20 Aug 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denmark===
[[Anders Lindegaard]] is one of the few footballers to have spoken out against the intolerance of homosexuality in football and the absence of openly gay players from the professional game. In a 2012 blog entry the Manchester United goalkeeper wrote: {{quote|As a footballer I think first and foremost that a homosexual colleague is afraid of the reception he could get from the fans. My impression is that the players would not have a problem accepting a homosexual. Homosexuality in football is a taboo subject. The atmosphere on the pitch and in the stands is tough. The mechanisms are primitive, and it is often expressed through a classic stereotype that a real man should be brave, strong and aggressive. And it is not the image that a football fan associates with a gay person. The problem for me is that a lot of football fans are stuck in a time of intolerance that does not deserve to be compared with modern society's development in the last decades. While the rest of the world has been more liberal, civilised and less prejudiced, the world of football remains stuck in the past when it comes to tolerance. Homosexuals are in need of a hero. They are in need of someone who dares to stand up for their sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.breakingnews.ie/sport/football-needs-gay-hero-says-manchester-united-goalkeeper-575849.html|title=Football needs gay hero, says Manchester United goalkeeper|publisher=Breaking News|date=28 November 2012|accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Justin Fashanu====
[[Justin Fashanu]], older brother of fellow footballer [[John Fashanu]], was the first professional footballer to come out as gay,&lt;ref name = "Cascarino"/&gt; after he agreed to an exclusive with ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' tabloid newspaper on 22 October 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=£1m Football Star: I AM GAY|date=22 October 1990|author=''The Sun''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fashanu claimed to have had an affair with a married Conservative MP who he first met in a London gay bar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Soccer star in gay romp|date=23 October 1990|author=''Herald Sun''}}&lt;/ref&gt; A week later, John Fashanu publicly distanced himself from his brother, describing Justin as an "outcast",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=John Fashanu: My Gay Brother is an outcast|date=30 October 1990|author=''The Voice''}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Justin's manager [[Brian Clough]] famously described him as a "[[bloody]] [[Homosexual|poof]]."&lt;ref name = "Cascarino"/&gt;

The [[Hamburger SV]] (HSV) player [[:de:Heinz Bonn]] (1947–1991) was the first [[Bundesliga]] player to be publicly known as being gay, but only after his death. He played for HSV from 1970 to 1973. He was murdered in his flat in Hannover on 5 December 1991, apparently by a male prostitute, according to police investigators, although the crime has never been solved. The historian Werner Skrentny has said at the time Bonn was playing, journalists had little interest in the private lives of footballers and it would have been unthinkable for him to come out.&lt;ref&gt;Becker, Andreas (18 September 2016) [http://www.ndr.de/fernsehen/sendungen/sportclub/Sportclub-Story-Heinz-Bonn,sendung500124.html Heinz Bonn.

[[Marcus Urban]], born 1971, played with the [[East German]] national youth football team and as an amateur in the [[2. Fußball-Bundesliga|second division]] club [[Rot-Weiß Erfurt]]. From the age of 13, he had been hot-housed at a specialist sports boarding school in [[Erfurt]] but at the age of 20, in 1991, when he was about to become a professional footballer, he gave up the sport. He came out to friends and family in 1994, and in 2007 publicly spoke to the media about his homosexuality and the difficulties that gay footballers experience. He said that the pressure of having to pretend to be something he wasn't 24 hours a day was too much for him. He became widely known after a biography titled ''Versteckspieler: Die Geschichte des schwulen Fußballers Marcus Urban'' ('Hidden Player: the story of the gay footballer Marcus Urban') was published in 2008.&lt;ref name=Blaschke&gt;Blaschke, Ronny (2008) ''Versteckspieler: Die Geschichte des schwulen Fußballers Marcus Urban''.

In December 2006, ''Rund'' magazine published an interview done over a two-year period with two gay footballers living secret lives.

In March 2010, former manager [[Rudi Assauer]] said that "If a player came to me and said he was gay I would say to him: 'You have shown courage'. But then I would tell him to find something else to do. That's because those who out themselves always end up busted by it, ridiculed by their fellow players and by people in the stands.

===Turkey===
Halil İbrahim Dinçdağ was a referee with the Turkey Football Federation for 13 years, but was sacked from this position due to his homosexuality. The Trabzon Board of Referees and the Turkish Football Association decided that he was not eligible for the role as he was previously excused from the military service for being homosexual. The Board of Referees came to this conclusion by upholding the private statue of the association, which states that people who do not complete their military duties due to a mental illness (including homosexuality) are not eligible to be a referee, although normally homosexuality is not considered as such by the Turkish constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Hefner, Robert W. Remaking Muslim politics: Pluralism, contestation, democratization. Robert W Hefner. Princeton University Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Turkey's famous football commentators, Erman Toroğlu, argued that he should not be given his referee position back due to the professional reasons such as the possibility for making wrong decisions related to his homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/gay-referee-gets-red-card-in-turkey-1718056.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with the Turkish journalist Canan Danyıldız, one of the famous Turkish football managers, Yılmaz Vural, was asked about the presence of LGBT people in Turkish football. He said that although he has never witnessed any homosexual interaction in the locker rooms, he knows that there exist gay football players in the Turkish League. He added that he does not believe homosexuality inhibits the talents of the players and that everyone should be free to live their personal lives the way that they want to. He finalized his words by saying that gay Turkish football players can never come out of the closet since everyone knows about the case of the former referee Dinçdağ.&lt;ref&gt;http://m.posta.com.tr/PostaKarnaval/haberdetay/-Gay-futbolcular-var--ama-ayri-muamele-yapmam--/213795&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important interview about LGBT people in Turkish Football was held between the journalist Elif Korap and the famous former football player and present football commentator Rıdvan Dilmen. When he was asked whether or not he knew of any gay Turkish football players, his answer was straightforward: "Of course, as there are in any other profession." Dilmen criticized other people in the Turkish football industry for not admitting the presence of LGBT people, since they are afraid of being considered as homosexual as well. Although Dilmen said that he does not approve the discrimination against the LGBT people in the Turkish football, on contrary, he argued that he would still disinherit his own kid for being gay once he was reminded about a negative comment he made during an interview in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.milliyet.com.tr/2004/11/21/pazar/apaz.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States and Canada===
Former [[Major League Soccer|MLS]] player [[David Testo]], having been released by [[Montreal Impact]] the previous month, affirmed he was gay in an interview on with the French Canadian division of [[Radio Canada]] that was published on November 10, 2011.&lt;ref name = "David Testo"&gt;{{cite web|title=David Testo affirme son homosexualité|trans-title=David Testo states his homosexuality|publisher=[[CBC.ca]]|date=10 November 2011|url=http://www.radio-canada.ca/sports/soccer/2011/11/10/001-testo-sortie-jeudi.shtml|accessdate=10 November 2011|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Horse racing''' is an [[equestrianism|equestrian]] performance [[sport]], typically involving two or more horses ridden by [[jockey]]s (or sometimes driven without riders) over a set distance for competition. It is one of the most ancient of all sports, as its basic premise – to identify which of two or more horses is the fastest over a set course or distance – has been unchanged since at least [[classical antiquity]].&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

Horse races vary widely in format and many countries have developed their own particular [[tradition]]s around the sport. Variations include restricting races to particular [[breed]]s, running over obstacles, running over different distances, running on different [[track surface]]s and running in different [[horse gait|gaits]].

While horses are sometimes raced purely for sport, a major part of horse racing's interest and economic importance is in the [[Gambling#Parimutuel betting|gambling]] associated with it,&lt;ref name=GamblingImpactStudy/&gt; an activity that in 2008 generated a worldwide market worth around US$115 billion.&lt;ref name=Intfed/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Théodore Géricault - Riderless Racers at Rome - Walters 37189.jpg|thumb|''Riderless Racers at Rome'' by [[Théodore Géricault]]]]
[[File:DV307 no.84 Horse racing near Apsley House, London.png|thumb|British nobility Horse racing at [[Apsley House]], London c.1850's]]
Horse racing has a long and distinguished history and has been practised in civilisations across the world since ancient times. Archaeological records indicate that horse racing occurred in [[Ancient Greece]], [[Babylon]], [[Syria]], and [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name=LibraryIndex/&gt; It also plays an important part of myth and legend, such as the contest between the steeds of the god [[Odin]] and the giant [[Hrungnir]] in [[Norse mythology]].

[[Chariot racing]] was one of the most popular [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]], [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine]] [[sport]]s. Both chariot and mounted horse racing were events in the ancient [[Ancient Olympic Games|Greek Olympics]] by 648 BC&lt;ref name=Hellenism/&gt; and were important in the other [[Panhellenic Games]]. It continued although chariot racing was often dangerous to both driver and horse, which  frequently suffered serious injury and even death. In the [[Roman Empire]], chariot and mounted horse racing were major industries.&lt;ref name=Rome/&gt; From the mid-fifteenth century until 1882, [[spring carnival]] in Rome closed with a horse race. Fifteen to 20 riderless horses, originally imported from the [[Barbary Coast]] of North Africa, were set loose to run the length of the [[Via del Corso]], a long, straight city street; their time was about 2½ minutes.

In later times, [[Thoroughbred]] racing became, and remains, popular with aristocrats and royalty of British society, earning it the title "Sport of Kings".&lt;ref name=Specogna/&gt;

Historically, equestrians honed their skills through games and races. Equestrian sports provided entertainment for crowds and displayed the excellent horsemanship needed in battle. Horse racing of all types evolved from impromptu competitions between riders or drivers. The various forms of competition, requiring demanding and specialized skills from both horse and rider, resulted in the systematic development of specialized breeds and equipment for each sport. The popularity of equestrian sports through the centuries has resulted in the preservation of skills that would otherwise have disappeared after horses stopped being used in combat.&lt;ref name=Olsen/&gt;

==Types of horse racing==
There are many different types of horse racing, including:

*'''[[Flat racing]]''', where horses [[Canter|gallop]] directly between two points around a straight or oval track.
*'''[[Jump racing]]''',  or '''Jumps racing''', also known as '''[[Steeplechase (horse racing)|Steeplechasing]]''' or, in the UK and Ireland, '''[[National Hunt racing]]''', where horses race over obstacles. 
*'''[[Harness racing]]''', where horses [[horse gait|trot or pace]] while pulling a driver in a [[sulky]].{{sfn|Edwards|1994|pp=332–337}}
*'''[[Endurance riding|Endurance racing]]''', where horses travel across country over extreme distances, generally ranging from {{convert|25|to|100|mi}}.

Different [[list of horse breeds|breeds of horses]] have developed that excel in each of the specific disciplines. Breeds that are used for flat racing include the [[Thoroughbred]], [[American Quarter Horse|Quarter Horse]], [[Arabian horse|Arabian]], [[American Paint Horse|Paint]], and [[Appaloosa]].&lt;ref name=USHorse/&gt; Jump racing breeds include the [[Thoroughbred]] and [[AQPS]]. In harness racing, [[Standardbred]]s are used in [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and North America, when in Europe, [[Russian Trotter|Russian]] and [[French Trotter]] are used with Standardbred. Light cold blood horses, such as [[Finnhorse]]s and [[Scandinavian coldblood trotter]] are also used in harness racing within their respective geographical areas.

There also are races for ponies: both flat and jump&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ponyracingauthority.co.uk/ PONY RACING AUTHORITY UK]&lt;/ref&gt; and harness racing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hippos.fi/raviurheilu/raviurheilu_lajina/raviurheilu_suomessa Racing in Finland](in Finnish)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flat racing===
{{main|Flat racing}}
[[Flat racing]] is the most common form of racing seen worldwide.  Flat racing tracks are typically oval in shape and are generally level, although in Great Britain and Ireland there is much greater variation, including [[Riding figures#Figure-eight|figure of eight]] tracks like [[Windsor Racecourse|Windsor]] and tracks with often severe gradients and changes of camber, such as [[Epsom Racecourse]]. Track surfaces vary, with turf most common in Europe, dirt more common in North America and Asia, and newly designed synthetic surfaces, such as [[Track surface#Polytrack|Polytrack]] or [[Track surface#Tapeta|Tapeta]], seen at some tracks.

Individual flat races are run over distances ranging from {{convert|440|yards}} up to {{convert|2+1/2|miles|spell=in|0}}, with distances between five and twelve [[furlong]]s being most common. Short races are generally referred to as "sprints", while longer races are known as "routes" in the United States or "staying races" in Europe. Although fast acceleration ("a turn of foot") is usually required to win either type of race, in general sprints are seen as a test of speed, while long distance races are seen as a test of stamina. The most prestigious flat races in the world, such as the [[Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe]], [[Melbourne Cup]], [[Japan Cup]], [[Epsom Derby]], [[Kentucky Derby]] and [[Dubai World Cup]], are run over distances in the middle of this range and are seen as tests of both speed and stamina to some extent.

In the most prestigious races, horses are generally allocated the same weight to carry for fairness, with allowances given to younger horses and female horses running against males.  These races are called [[conditions races]] and offer the biggest [[purse (horseracing)|purses]]. There is another category of races called [[handicap (horse racing)|handicap race]]s where each horse is assigned a different weight to carry based on its ability.&lt;ref name=HRChannel/&gt; Beside the weight they carry, horses' performance can also be influenced by position relative to the inside barrier (post position), gender, jockey, and training.

===Jump racing===
{{main|National Hunt racing|Steeplechase (horse racing)|Hurdling (horse race)}}
Jump (or jumps) racing in Great Britain and Ireland is known as [[National Hunt racing]] (although, confusingly, National Hunt racing also includes flat races taking place at jumps meetings; these are known as [[National Hunt flat]] races). Jump racing can be subdivided into [[Steeplechase (horse racing)|steeplechasing]] and [[Hurdling (horse race)|hurdling]], according to the type and size of obstacles being jumped. The word "steeplechasing" can also refer collectively to any type of jump race in certain racing jurisdictions, particularly in the United States.

Typically, horses progress to bigger obstacles and longer distances as they get older, so that a European jumps horse will tend to start in National Hunt flat races as a juvenile, move on to hurdling after a year or so, and then, if thought capable, move on to steeplechasing.

===Endurance racing===
{{Main|Endurance riding}}
The length of an endurance race varies greatly.  Some are very short, only ten miles, while others can be up to one hundred miles.  There are a few races that are even longer than one hundred miles and last multiple days.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.equiworld.net/uk/sports/endurance/index.htm "Endurance Riding"] Equiworld.net. 8 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  These different lengths of races are divided into five categories: pleasure rides (10–20 miles), non-competitive trail rides (21–27 miles), competitive trail rides (20–45 miles), progressive trail rides (25–60 miles), and endurance rides (40–100 miles in one day, up to {{convert|250|mi|km}} in multiple days).&lt;ref name=types/&gt;  Because each race is very long, trails of natural terrain are generally used.

Contemporary organized [[endurance riding|endurance racing]] began in [[California]] around 1955, and the first race marked the beginning of the [[Tevis Cup]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.horseracing.com/types-of-horse-racing/endurance/ "Endurance Horse Racing".] HorseRacing.com. The Horse Racing Channel. 8 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; This race was a one-hundred-mile, one-day-long ride starting in [[Squaw Valley, Placer County, California|Squaw Valley]], [[Placer County]], and ending in [[Auburn, California|Auburn]]. Founded in 1972, the American Endurance Ride Conference was the United States' first national endurance riding association.&lt;ref name=types&gt;[http://www.equiworld.net/uk/sports/endurance/index.htm "Endurance Riding".] Equiworld.net. 8 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  The longest endurance race in the world is the [[Mongol Derby]], which is {{convert|1000|km|abbr=on}} long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Longest multi-horse race | publisher =Guinness World Records | url =http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/7000/longest-multi-horse-race | accessdate = September 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Suffolk Downs horse racing.JPG|thumb|Suffolk Downs starting gate, East Boston, Massachusetts]]

==Breeds==
{{details|Horse breeding}}

In most horse races, entry is restricted to certain breeds; that is, the horse must have a sire (father) and a dam (mother) who are studbook-approved individuals of whatever breed is racing.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}  For example, in a normal harness race, the horse's sire and dam must both be pure Standardbreds. The exception to this is in Quarter Horse racing, where an Appendix Quarter Horse may be considered eligible to race against (standard) Quarter Horses. The designation of "Appendix" refers to the addendum section, or Appendix, of the Official Quarter Horse registry. An Appendix Quarter Horse is a horse that has either one Quarter Horse parent and one parent of any other eligible breed (such as Thoroughbred, the most common Appendix cross), two parents that are registered Appendix Quarter Horses, or one parent that is a Quarter Horse and one parent that is an Appendix Quarter Horse. AQHA also issues a "Racing Register of Merit," which allows a horse to race on Quarter Horse tracks, but not be considered a Quarter Horse for breeding purposes (unless other requirements are met).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aqha.com/association/registration/pdf/racingrules_09.pdf AQHA.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225115125/http://www.aqha.com/association/registration/pdf/racingrules_09.pdf |date=2009-02-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A stallion who has won many races may be put up to [[Stud (animal)|stud]] when he is retired. [[Artificial insemination]] and [[embryo transfer]] technology (allowed only in some breeds) has brought changes to the traditions and ease of breeding.

Pedigrees of stallions are recorded in various books and websites, such as ''Weatherbys Stallion Book'', the ''Australian Stud Book'' and ''Thoroughbred Heritage''.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===Thoroughbred===
{{Main|Thoroughbred}}
There are three founding sires that all Thoroughbreds can trace back to in the male line: the [[Darley Arabian]], the [[Godolphin Arabian]], and the [[Byerly Turk]], named after their respective owners [[Thomas Darley]], Lord Godolphin, and Captain Robert Byerly. They were taken to England, where they were mated with mares from English and imported bloodlines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Foundation Sires|url=http://www.tbheritage.com/HistoricSires/FoundationSires.html|website=www.tbheritage.com|accessdate=17 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resultant foals were the first generation of Thoroughbreds, and all modern Thoroughbreds trace back to them. Thoroughbreds range in height, which is measured in [[Hand (unit)|hands]] (a hand being four inches). Some are as small as 15 hands while others are over 17. Thoroughbreds can travel medium distances at fast paces, requiring a balance between speed and endurance. Thoroughbreds may be [[Bay (horse)|bay]], [[Black (horse)|black]], dark bay/brown, [[Chestnut (coat)|chestnut]], [[Gray (horse)|gray]], [[Roan (horse)|roan]], [[White (horse)|white]] or [[palomino]]. Artificial insemination, cloning and embryo transfer are not allowed in the Thoroughbred breed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jockey Club Interactive Registration|url=http://www.registry.jockeyclub.com/registry.cfm?Page=tjcRuleBook|website=www.registry.jockeyclub.com|accessdate=17 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arabian horse===
{{Main|Arabian horse}}
The Arabian horse was developed by the Bedouin people of the [[Middle East]] specifically for stamina over long distances, so they could outrun their enemies.  It was not until 1725 that the Arabian was introduced into the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.essortment.com/all/historyofthe_ryjk.htm "History of the Arabian Horse"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225062836/http://www.essortment.com/all/historyofthe_ryjk.htm |date=2010-12-25 }}  Essortment.com 8 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Arabians appeared in the United States in colonial times, though were not bred as purebreds until about the time of the Civil War.  Until the formation of the Arabian Horse Registry of America in 1908&lt;!--need to verify date--&gt;, Arabians were recorded with the [[Jockey Club]] in a separate subsection from Thoroughbreds.

Arabians must be able to withstand traveling long distances at a moderate pace.  They have an abundance of type I [[Myocyte|muscle fibers]], enabling their muscles to work for extended periods of time.  Also, the muscles of the Arabian are not nearly as massive as those of the Quarter Horse, which allow it to travel longer distances at quicker speeds.  The Arabian is primarily used today in [[endurance riding|endurance racing]], but is also raced over traditional race tracks in many countries.

Arabian Horse Racing is governed by the International Federation of Arabian Horse Racing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifahr.net IFAHR (The International Federation of Arabian Horse Racing Authorities)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quarter Horse===
{{Main|American Quarter Horse}}
The ancestors of the Quarter Horse were prevalent in America in the early 17th century.  These horses were a blend of [[Colonial Spanish horse]]s crossed with English horses that were brought over in the 1700s.  The native horse and the English horse were bred together, resulting in a compact, muscular horse.  At this time, they were mainly used for chores such as plowing and cattle work.  The American Quarter Horse was not recognized as an official breed until the formation of the [[American Quarter Horse Association]] in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.essortment.com/all/quarterhorsesh_raga.htm "Quarter Horse History"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225062809/http://www.essortment.com/all/quarterhorsesh_raga.htm |date=2010-12-25 }} Essortment.com 8 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to be successful in racing, Quarter Horses need to be able to propel themselves forward at extremely fast sprinter speed.  The Quarter Horse has much larger hind limb muscles than the Arabian, which make it less suitable for endurance racing.&lt;ref&gt;Crook, T.C., et al. "Comparative Anatomy and Muscle Architecture of Selected Hind Limb Muscles in the Quarter Horse and Arab.

When Quarter Horse racing began, it was very expensive to lay a full mile of track so it was agreed that a straight track of four hundred meters, or one quarter of a mile, would be laid instead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.horseracing.com/types-of-horse-racing/quarter-horse/ "Quarter Horse Racing"] HorseRacing.com. The Horse Racing Channel. 13 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  It became the standard racing distance for Quarter Horses and inspired their name.  With the exception of the longer, {{convert|870|yd|m|-1|adj=on}} distance contests, Quarter Horse races are run flat out, with the horses running at top speed for the duration. There is less jockeying for position, as turns are rare, and many races end with several contestants grouped together at the wire.  The track surface is similar to that of Thoroughbred racing and usually consists of dirt.

In addition to the three main racing breeds above and their crosses, horse racing may be conducted using various other breeds: Appaloosa, American Paint Horse, [[mule]]s, [[Selle Francais|Selle Français]], AQPS&lt;ref&gt;Also race with thoroughbreds in Europe&lt;/ref&gt; and Korean [[Jeju horse|Jeju]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://race.kra.co.kr/globalEn/racingInfomation.do Racing Information - KRA]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Horse breeds and muscle structure===
Muscles are bundles of contractile fibers that are attached to bones by tendons.  These bundles have different types of fibers within them, and horses have adapted over the years to produce different amounts of these fibers.  Type II-b fibers are fast twitch fibers.  These fibers allow muscles to contract quickly, resulting in a great deal of power and speed.  Type I fibers are slow-twitch fibers.  They allow muscles to work for longer periods of time resulting in greater endurance.  Type II-a fibers are intermediate, representing a balance between the fast-twitch fibers and the slow-twitch fibers.  They allow the muscles to generate both speed and endurance.  Type I muscle fibers are adapted for aerobic exercise and rely on the presence of oxygen.  Type II muscles are needed for [[anaerobic exercise]] because they can function in the absence of oxygen. Thoroughbreds possess more type II-a muscle fibers than Quarter Horses or Arabians.  This type of fiber allows them to propel themselves forward at great speeds and maintain it for an extended distance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tufts.edu/vet/sports/quarter.html "What Makes a Quarter Horse Different from a Thoroughbred"?] Tufts Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine. 8 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training==
[[File:James Pollard - The Derby Pets- The Winner - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|The [[Epsom Derby]]; painting by [[James Pollard]], c. 1840]]
The conditioning program for the different horses varies depending on the race length.  Genetics, training, age, and skeletal soundness are all factors that contribute to a horse's performance.&lt;ref name=training&gt;[https://animalscience.tamu.edu/equine-science-publications/ Gibbs, P.G., G.D. Potter, B.D. Nielsen, D.D. Householder, and W. Moyer. Scientific Principles for Conditioning Race and Performance Horses.] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110806092629/https://animalscience.tamu.edu/equine-science-publications/ |date=2018-09-27 }} Publication. Texas A&amp;M University Department of Animal Science Equine Sciences Program. 29 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  The muscle structure and fiber type of horses depends on the breed; therefore, genetics must be considered when constructing a conditioning plan.  A horse's fitness plan must be coordinated properly in order to prevent injury or lameness.  If these are to occur, they may negatively affect a horse's willingness to learn.&lt;ref name=training/&gt;  Sprinting exercises are appropriate for training two-year-old racehorses, but the number is limited by psychological factors as well as physical.&lt;ref name=training/&gt;  A horse's skeletal system adapts to the exercise it receives.  Because the skeletal system does not reach full maturity until the horse is at least four years of age, young racehorses often suffer injuries.&lt;ref name=training/&gt;

==Horse racing by continent==
===North America===

====United States====
{{See also|Horse racing in the United States}}
In the United States, Thoroughbred flat races are run on surfaces of either dirt, synthetic or turf. Other tracks offer [[American Quarter Horse|Quarter Horse]] racing and [[Standardbred horse|Standardbred]] racing, on combinations of these three types of racing surfaces. Racing of other breeds, such as Arabian horse racing, is found on a limited basis. American Thoroughbred races are run at a wide variety of distances, most commonly from {{convert|5|to|12|furlong|mi km}}; with this in mind, breeders of Thoroughbred race horses attempt to breed horses that excel at a particular distance (see [[Dosage Index|dosage index]]).

Horse racing in the United States and on the North American continent dates back to 1665, which saw the establishment of the Newmarket course in Salisbury, New York, a section of what is now known as the Hempstead Plains of [[Long Island]], New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/sports/horse-racing|title=horse racing {{!}} sport|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=2016-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This first racing meet in North America was supervised by New York's colonial governor, [[Richard Nicolls]]. The area is now occupied by the present [[Nassau County, New York]], region of Greater [[Westbury, New York|Westbury]] and East Garden City. The South Westbury section is still known as Salisbury.

The first record of quarter mile length races dated back to 1674 in [[Henrico County]], [[Virginia]]. Each race consisted of only two horses, and they raced down the village streets and lanes.  The Quarter Horse received its name from the length of the race.

The [[American Stud Book]] was started in 1868, prompting the beginning of organized horse racing in the [[United States]]. There were 314 tracks operating in the United States by 1890; and in 1894, the American Jockey Club was formed.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;[http://www.winningponies.com/horse-racing-history.html "History of Horse Racing."] WinningPonies.com. 7 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pleasanton Fairgrounds Racetrack]] at the [[Alameda County Fairgrounds]] is the oldest remaining horse racing track in America,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.race-track.info/alameda-county-fair-horse-racing.html "Alameda County Fair Horse Racing"] race-track.info. retrieved 11 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; dating back to 1858, when it was founded by the sons of the Spaniard Don Agustin Bernal.

[[File:A Race Meeting at Jacksonville, Alabama by W.S. Hedges - BMA.jpg|thumb|Horse racing at Jacksonville, Alabama, 1841]]
[[Belmont Park]] is located at the western edge of the Hempstead Plains. Its mile-and-a-half main track is the largest dirt Thoroughbred race course in the world, and it has the sport's largest [[grandstand]].

One of the latest major horse track opened in the United States was the [[Meadowlands Racetrack]], opened in 1977 for Thoroughbred racing. It is the home of the [[Meadowlands Cup]]. Other more recently opened tracks include [[Remington Park]], [[Oklahoma City]], opened in 1988, and [[Lone Star Park]] in the [[Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex|Dallas–Fort Worth Metroplex]], opened in 1997; the latter track hosted the prestigious [[Breeders' Cup]] series of races in 2004.

[[Thoroughbred horse racing]] in the United States has its own [[National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] in [[Saratoga Springs, New York]]. The Hall of Fame honors remarkable horses, [[jockey]]s, owners, and trainers.

The traditional high point of US horse racing is the [[Kentucky Derby]], held on the first Saturday of May at [[Churchill Downs]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]]. Together, the Derby; the [[Preakness Stakes]], held two weeks later at [[Pimlico Race Course]] in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]]; and the [[Belmont Stakes]], held three weeks after the Preakness at [[Belmont Park]] on Long Island, form the [[United States Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing|Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing]] for three-year-olds. They are all held early in the year, throughout May and the beginning of June.  In recent years the [[Breeders' Cup]] races, run at the end of the year, have challenged the Triple Crown events as determiners of the three-year-old champion. The Breeders' Cup is normally held at a different track every year; however, the 2010 and 2011 editions were both held at Churchill Downs, and the 2012, 2013 and 2014 races were held at [[Santa Anita Park]]. [[Keeneland]], in Lexington, Kentucky, hosted the 2015 Breeders' Cup.

The corresponding Standardbred event is the [[Breeders Crown]]. There are also a [[Triple Crown of Harness Racing for Pacers]] and a [[Triple Crown of Harness Racing for Trotters]].

For Arabians, there is the Arabian Triple Crown, consisting of Drinkers of the Wind Derby in California, the Texas Six Shooter Stakes, and the Bob Magness Derby in Delaware.

American betting on horse racing is sanctioned and regulated by the state where the race is located.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Becker|first1=Frank|title=Equine Law|date=2013|isbn=978-0-615-90347-7|page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simulcast betting exists across state lines with minimal oversight except the companies involved through legalized [[parimutuel gambling]].  A takeout, or "take", is removed from each [[betting pool]] and distributed according to state law, among the state, race track and horsemen. A variety of factors affect takeout, namely location and the type of wager that is placed.&lt;ref&gt;http://thoroughbredracing.com/commentary/takeout-thoroughbred-racing-–-yes-it’s-too-high {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301054558/http://thoroughbredracing.com/commentary/takeout-thoroughbred-racing-%E2%80%93-yes-it%E2%80%99s-too-high |date=2014-03-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One form of parimutuel gaming is [[Instant Racing]], in which players bet on video replays of races.

[[Advanced Deposit Wagering]] is a form of gambling on the outcome of horse races in which the bettor must fund his or her account before being allowed to place bets. ADW is often conducted online or by phone. In contrast to ADW, credit shops allow wagers without advance funding; accounts are settled at month-end. Racetrack owners, horse trainers and state governments sometimes receive a cut of ADW revenues.

====Canada====
The most famous horse from Canada is generally considered to be [[Northern Dancer]], who after winning the [[Kentucky Derby]], Preakness and Queen's Plate in 1964 went on to become the most successful Thoroughbred sire of the twentieth century; his two-minute-flat Derby was the fastest on record until Secretariat in 1973. The only challenger to his title of greatest Canadian horse would be his son [[Nijinsky II]], who is the last horse to win the English [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing|Triple Crown]]. [[Woodbine Racetrack]] (1956) in Toronto is home of the [[Queen's Plate]] (1860), Canada's premier Thoroughbred stakes race, and the [[North America Cup]] (1984), Canada's premier Standardbred stakes race. It is the only race track in North America which stages Thoroughbred and Standardbred (harness) meetings on the same day. The [[Canadian International Stakes|Canadian International]] and [[Woodbine Mile]] (1981) are Canada's most important Grade I races worth [[C$]]1,000,000 each, and have been won by many renowned horses such as [[Secretariat (horse)|Secretariat]] and [[Wise Dan]] respectively. Other key races include [[Woodbine Oaks]] (1956), [[Prince of Wales Stakes]] (1929), [[Breeders' Stakes]] (1889) and [[Canadian Derby]] (1930).

===Europe===

====Belgium====
Horse racing in Belgium takes place at three venues - [[Hippodrome Wellington]] in [[Ostend]] (opened in 1883 in honour of [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]]), [[Hippodroom Waregem]] in [[Waregem]] in [[Flanders]] and [[Hippodrome de Wallonie]] in [[Mons]], [[Wallonia]].

====Czech Republic====
There are [[List of horse racing venues|15 racecourses]] in the Czech Republic, most notably Pardubice Racecourse, where the country's most famous race, the [[Velka pardubicka|Velka Pardubicka steeplechase]], has been run since 1874.&lt;ref name=Pardubika/&gt; Since 1907 races have also held on a central racecourse in [[Prague]], Velka Chuchle.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} However, the first official race was organized back in 1816 by [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Francis II]] near [[Kladruby nad Labem]]. The Czech horse racing season usually starts at the beginning of April and ends some time in November. Racing takes place mostly at weekends and there is usually one meeting on a Saturday and one on Sunday.&lt;ref name=Czech/&gt; Horse races, as well as Thoroughbred horse breeding, is organized by Jockey Club Czech Republic, founded in 1919.&lt;ref name=DirTurf/&gt;

====France====
{{see also|List of French flat horse races|Category:Horse racing in France|French flat racing Champion Jockey}}

France has a major horse racing industry. It is home to the famous [[Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe]] held at [[Longchamp Racecourse]], the richest race in Europe and the second richest turf race in the world after the Japan Cup, with a prize of 4 million Euros (approximately US$5.2 million).  Other major races include the [[Grand Prix de Paris]], the [[Prix du Jockey Club]] (the French [[Derby (horse race)|Derby]]) and the [[Prix de Diane]]. Besides Longchamp, France's other premier flat racecourses include [[Chantilly Racecourse|Chantilly]] and [[Deauville Racecourse|Deauville]]. There is also a smaller but nevertheless important jumps racing sector, with Auteil Racecourse being the most well known. The sport's governing body is [[France Galop]].

====Great Britain====

Horse racing in Great Britain is predominantly thoroughbred [[flat racing|flat]] and [[National Hunt racing|jumps]] racing. It was in Great Britain in the 17th to 19th centuries that many of the sport's rules and regulations were established. Named after [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 12th Earl of Derby]], [[Epsom Derby|The Derby]] was first run in 1780. The race serves as the middle leg of the British [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing#United Kingdom|Triple Crown]], preceded by the [[2000 Guineas Stakes|2000 Guineas]] and followed by the [[St Leger Stakes|St&amp;nbsp;Leger]]. The name "[[Derby (horse race)|Derby]]" has since become synonymous with great races all over the world, and as such has been borrowed many times in races abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Reeves, Richard Stone (1997), Crown jewels of thoroughbred racing: original paintings (Illustrated ed.), p. 134. Eclipse Press&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Grand National]] is the most prominent race in [[British culture]], watched by many people who do not normally watch or bet on horse racing at other times of the year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grandnational.org.uk/grand-national-betting.php Grand National Betting] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100927174837/http://grandnational.org.uk/grand-national-betting.php |date=2010-09-27 }}. Grandnational.org.uk. Retrieved on 15 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the sport's greatest jockeys, most notably Sir [[Gordon Richards]], have been British. The sport is regulated by the [[British Horseracing Authority]]. The BHA's authority does not extend to Northern Ireland; racing in Ireland is governed on an [[All-Ireland]] basis.

====Greece====
Despite having an ancient tradition with well-documented history, all racetracks in Greece have ceased operation due to the [[austerity measures|Greek government-debt crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.odie.gr/el/odiePage/info&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hungary====
Hungary has a long-standing horse racing tradition. The first horse racing in Pest was noted June 6, 1827.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} Although racing in Hungary is neither as popular nor as prestigious as it is in Western Europe, the country is notable for producing some fine international racehorses. Foremost of these is [[Kincsem]], foaled in 1874 and the most successful Thoroughbred race horse ever, having won 54 races in 54 starts. The country also produced [[Overdose (horse)|Overdose]], a horse who won his first 12 races, including [[group race]]s in [[Germany]] and [[Italy]], and finished fourth in the [[King's Stand Stakes]] at [[Royal Ascot]].

====Ireland====
{{main|Horse Racing Ireland}}
Ireland has a rich history of horse racing; [[Point to point (steeplechase)|point to pointing]] originated there, and even today, [[National Hunt racing|jump racing]] is more popular than racing on the flat. As a result, every year Irish horse racing fans travel in huge numbers to the highlight event of the National Hunt calendar, the [[Cheltenham Festival]], and in recent years Irish owned or bred horses have dominated the event.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} Ireland has a thriving Thoroughbred breeding industry, stimulated by favourable tax treatment. The world's largest Thoroughbred stud farm, [[Coolmore Stud]], has its main site there (in addition to major operations in the U.S. and Australia).

In recent years, Irish bred and trained horses have enjoyed considerable success in major races worldwide. Various horses achieved victory in one or more of the [[2000 Guineas|British 2000 Guineas]], [[Epsom Derby|The Derby]] and the [[Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe]], considered the three most prestigious races in Europe. In the six runnings of the Epsom Derby between 2008 and 2013, Irish horses filled 20 of the first 30 placings, winning the race 5 times.

====Italy====
{{See also|List of horse races#Italy|l1=List of horse races in Italy}}
Historically, Italy has been one of the leading European horse racing nations, albeit some respects behind Great Britain, Ireland and France in size and prestige. The late Italian horse breeder [[Federico Tesio]] was particularly notable. In recent years, however, the sport in the country has suffered a major funding crisis, culminating in its expulsion from the European [[Pattern races|Pattern]].&lt;ref name=RP140416/&gt;

====Poland====
[[File:Pierwsze wyscigi.jpg|thumb|"First regular horse racing on [[Pola Mokotowskie]] in [[Warsaw]]" [[January Suchodolski]] 1849.]]

Horse racing in Poland can be dated to 1777, when a horse owned by Polish noble [[House of Rzewuski|Kazimierz Rzewuski]] beat the horse of the English [[chargé d'affaires]], [[Charles Whitworth, 1st Earl Whitworth|Sir Charles Whitworth]], on the road from [[Wola]] to [[Ujazdów Castle]]. The first regular horse racing was organized in 1841 on [[Mokotów Field]]s in [[Warsaw]] by Towarzystwo Wyścigów Konnych i Wystawy Zwierząt Gospodarskich w Królestwie Polskim (in English, the Society of Horse Racing in Congress Poland). The main racetrack in Poland is Warsaw's Służewiec Racecourse. The industry was severely limited during the [[Communist]] era, when gambling, the major source of funding, was made illegal.

In Australia, the most famous racehorse was [[Phar Lap]] (bred in New Zealand), who raced from 1928 to 1932. Phar Lap carried {{nowrap|9 st 12 lb (62.5 kg)}} to win the 1930 Melbourne Cup. Australian [[Steeplechase (horse racing)|steeplechase]]r [[Crisp (horse)|Crisp]] is remembered for his battle with Irish champion [[Red Rum]] in the 1973 [[Grand National]]. In 2003–2005 the mare [[Makybe Diva]] (bred in Great Britain) became the only racehorse to ever win the [[Melbourne Cup]] three times, let alone in consecutive years.

====New Zealand====
{{main|Thoroughbred racing in New Zealand|Harness racing in New Zealand}}
Racing is a long-established sport in [[New Zealand]], stretching back to colonial times.

Horse racing is a significant part of the New Zealand economy which in 2004 generated 1.3% of the [[GDP]]. The indirect impact of expenditures on racing was estimated to have generated more than $1.4 billion in economic activity in 2004 and created 18,300 full-time equivalent jobs. More than 40,000 people were involved in some capacity in the New Zealand racing industry in 2004. In 2004, more than one million people attended race meetings in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.civildefence.govt.nz/Pubforms.nsf/URL/RacingBIMOctober2005.pdf/$file/RacingBIMOctober2005.pdf |title=Briefing for Incoming Minister Racing October 2005 p.8 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326163120/http://www.civildefence.govt.nz/Pubforms.nsf/URL/RacingBIMOctober2005.pdf/$file/RacingBIMOctober2005.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 69 Thoroughbred and 51 harness clubs licensed in New Zealand. Racecourses are situated in 59 locations throughout New Zealand.

The bloodstock industry is important to New Zealand, with the export sale of horses – mainly to Australia and Asia – generating more than $120 million a year. During the 2008–09 racing season 19 New Zealand bred horses won 22 Group One races around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Racetrack Sires 2009, June/August, 2009, ''Record season for the New Zealand breed'', p.52&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable racehorses from New Zealand include [[Cardigan Bay (horse)|Cardigan Bay]], [[Carbine (horse)|Carbine]], [[Nightmarch]], [[Sunline]], [[Desert Gold (horse)|Desert Gold]] and [[Rising Fast]].&lt;ref name="de Bourg"&gt;de Bourg, Ross, ''The Australian and New Zealand Thoroughbred'', Nelson, West Melbourne, 1980, {{ISBN|0-17-005860-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Digby"&gt;Digby, John; "Thoroughbred Families and Sires of Australian and New Zealand", AJC &amp; VRC, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; [[Phar Lap]] and [[Tulloch (horse)|Tulloch]] were both bred in New Zealand but did not race there.

On 25 June 1812, the [[Champ de Mars Racecourse]] was inaugurated by The Mauritius Turf Club which was founded earlier in the same year by Colonel [[Edward A. Draper]]. The Champ de Mars is situated on a prestigious avenue in [[Port Louis]], the capital city and is the oldest racecourse in the [[southern hemisphere]]. The Mauritius Turf Club is the second oldest active turf club in the world.

Undeniably, racing is one of the most popular sports in [[Mauritius]] now attracting regular crowds of 20,000 people or more to the only racecourse of the island.

A high level of professionalism has been attained in the organisation of races over the last decades preserving the unique electrifying ambiance prevailing on race days at the Champ de Mars.

Members of the  [[British Royal Family]], such as Queen [[Elizabeth II]], [[Princess Margaret]] or the [[Queen Mother]] have attended or patroned races at the Champ de Mars numerous times.

Champ de Mars has four classic events a year such as: Duchess of York Cup, Barbé Cup, Maiden Cup and the Duke of York Cup.

Most of the horses are imported from South Africa but some are also acquired from Australia, the United Kingdom and France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/country_profiles/2988827.stm |title=BBC News |publisher=BBC News |date=2013-04-02 |accessdate=2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elegantdestinations.com/mauritius.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130608235533/http://www.elegantdestinations.com/mauritius.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-06-08 |title=Mauritius Villas and Hotels |publisher=Elegantdestinations.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maurinet.com/racing.html |title=Mauritius Island Online |publisher=Maurinet.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mauritiusonline.info/horse-racing/the-racing-industry-history The Mauritius Turf Club] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729011552/http://www.mauritiusonline.info/horse-racing/the-racing-industry-history |date=2014-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.otayo.com/mtc.htm Billetterie – Otayo Maurice] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916075051/http://www.otayo.com/mtc.htm |date=September 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asianracing.org/members/manr.html Asianracing.org Asian Racing Federation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213152856/http://www.asianracing.org/members/manr.html |date=2007-12-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Champ de Mars Racecourse]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.users.bigpond.com/clancy/trivia.htm#The%20Mauritius%20Turf%20Club Bigpond.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080220133746/http://www.users.bigpond.com/clancy/trivia.htm |date=2008-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====South Africa====
Horse racing is a popular sport in [[South Africa]] that can be traced back to 1797. The first recorded race club meeting took place five years later in 1802.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southafrica.info/ess_info/sa_glance/sports/horseracing.htm|title=Horse racing in South Africa|access-date=2007-12-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214121609/http://www.southafrica.info/ess_info/sa_glance/sports/horseracing.htm|archive-date=2007-12-14|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The national horse racing body is known as the [[National Horseracing Authority]] and was founded in 1882. The premier event, which attracts 50,000 people to Durban, is the [[Durban July Handicap]], which has been run since 1897 at [[Greyville Racecourse]]. It is the largest and most prestigious event on the continent, with betting running into the hundreds of millions of Rands. Several July winners have gone on to win major international races, such as Colorado King, London News, and Ipi Tombe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.racehorseowner.com/art/rho-durban-july-handicap.html |title=Durban July Handicap |publisher=Racehorseowner.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the other notable major races are the Summer Cup, held at [[Turffontein Racecourse]] in [[Johannesburg]], and The Sun Met, which is held at Kenilworth race track in [[Cape Town]].

===Asia===
====China====
Horse racing in one form or another has been a part of Chinese culture for millennia. Horse racing was a popular pastime for the aristocracy at least by the [[Zhou Dynasty]] - 4th century B.C. General [[Tian Ji]]'s strategem for a horse race remains perhaps the best known story about horse racing in that period. In the 18th and 19th centuries, horse racing and equestrian sports in [[China]] was dominated by [[Mongol]] influences.

Thoroughbred horse racing came to China with British settlements in the middle 1800s and most notably centered around the treaty ports, including the two major race courses in [[Shanghai]], the [[Shanghai Race Club|Shanghai Racecourse]] and the International Recreation Grounds (in Kiang-wan), and the racecourses of [[Tianjin]]. The Kiang-wan racecourse was destroyed in the lead-up to the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] and the Shanghai Race Club closed in 1954. The former Shanghai Racecourse is now People's Square and People's Park and the former club building was the [[Shanghai Art Museum]].

As [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] are [[Special Administrative Regions|Special Administrative Region]], they're allowed to exemption from ban of gambling on mainland China. (See below)

Horse racing was banned in the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] from 1945, and the [[People's Republic of China]] maintained the ban after 1949, although allowances were made for ethnic minority peoples for whom horse sports are a cultural tradition. Speed horse racing (速度赛马) was an event in the [[National Games of China]], mainly introduced to cater for minority peoples, such as the [[Mongols]]. The race course was initially 5&amp;nbsp;km, but from 2005 (the 10th National Games) was extended to 12&amp;nbsp;km. The longer race led to deaths and injuries to participating horses in both 2005 and the 11th National Games in 2009. Also, with the entry into the sport of [[Han Chinese|Han majority]] provinces such as [[Hubei]], which are better funded and used Western, rather than traditional, breeding and training techniques, meant that the original purpose of the event to foster traditional horse racing for groups like the Mongols was at risk of being usurped. At the 2009 National Games, Hubei won both the gold and silver medals, with [[Inner Mongolia]] winning bronze. As a result of these factors, the event was abolished for the 12th National Games in 2013.

Club horse racing reappeared on a small scale in the 1990s. In 2008, the China Speed Horse Race Open in [[Wuhan]] was organized as the qualification round for the speed horse race event at the National Games the next year, but was also seen by commentators as a step towards legalizing both horse racing and gambling on the races.&lt;ref name=Reuters/&gt; The Wuhan Racecourse was the only racecourse that organized races in China.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150125232903/http://www.olhgroup.com/en/Orient.asp Wuhan Racecourse]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the Wuhan Jockey Club organized more than 80 races. Almost all Chinese trainers and jockeys stabled in Wuhan. However, with the demise of the event at the National Games and the government not relenting from the ban on commercial racing, various racecourses built in recent years are all in a state of disuse:  The Nanjing Racecourse, which previously hosted National Games equestrian events, is now used as a car park;&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.caixin.com/2012-09-07/100434503.html Caixin - Nanjing Horse Track Used as a Carpark]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Beijing Jockey Club]] was shut down in 2008. The racecourse in [[Inner Mongolia]] has not been active after 2012.

Horse racing eventually returned to mainland China on year 2014 as one-day, five-card event for foreign horses, trainers and jockeys.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emiratesracing.com/news/third-chengdu-dubai-international-cup-set-saturday-april-2 Third Chengdu Dubai International Cup Set for Saturday April 2] Emirates Racing Authority&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hong Kong====
[[File:Hongkongjockeyclub.jpg|thumb|[[Happy Valley Racecourse]] in Hong Kong at night]]
The British tradition of horse racing left its mark with the creation of one of the most important entertainment and gambling institutions in Hong Kong. Established as the [[Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club]] in 1884, the non-profit organisation conducts nearly 700 races every season at the two race tracks in [[Happy Valley Racecourse|Happy Valley]] and [[Sha Tin Racecourse|Sha Tin]].

All horses are imported since there is no breeding operation.
The sport annually draws millions of dollars of tax revenue. Off-track betting is available from overseas bookmakers.

====Macau====
Jockey Club of Macau was established for harness racing. It started to conduct horse races in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mjc.mo/race_en/info/r_pages.php?id=41[Macau Jockey Club - Preface]&lt;/ref&gt;

====India====
{{main|Horse racing in India}}
[[File:Mysore Turf Club.jpg|thumb|Mysore Turf Club]]
Horse racing in India is over 200 years old, making India quite possibly the oldest racing jurisdiction in Asia where racing was conducted under rules.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} India's first racecourse was set up in Madras in 1777. Today India has a very well established racing and breeding industry, and the sport is conducted on nine racetracks by seven racing authorities.

====Japan====
{{main|Horseracing in Japan}}
[[File:Nakayama Racecourse01.jpg|thumb|[[Nakayama Racecourse]] in Funabashi, Japan]]

Japan has two governing bodies that control its horseracing - the [[Japan Racing Association]] (JRA), and [[National Association of Racing]] (NAR). Between them they conduct more than 21,000 horse races a year. The JRA is responsible for 'Chuo Keiba' (meaning 'central horse racing'), taking place on the ten main Japanese tracks. The NAR, meanwhile, is responsible for 'Chihou Keiba' (meaning 'local horse racing'). Racing in Japan is mainly [[flat racing]], but Japan also has [[jump racing]] and a sled-pulling race known as [[Ban'ei]] (also called Draft Racing).

Japan's top stakes races are run in the spring, autumn, and winter. These include the country's most prominent race - the Grade 1 [[Japan Cup]], a 2,400 m (about 1½ mile) invitational turf race run every November at [[Tokyo Racecourse]] for a purse of ¥476 million (about US$5.6 million), currently the richest turf race in the world. Other noted stakes races include the [[February Stakes]], [[Takamatsunomiya Kinen]], [[Yasuda Kinen]], [[Takarazuka Kinen]], [[Arima Kinen]], and the [[Tenno Sho]] races run in the spring and fall. Japan's top jump race is the [[Nakayama Grand Jump]], run every April at [[Nakayama Racecourse]].

====Malaysia====
In [[Malaysia]], horse racing was introduced during the British colonial era and remains to the present day as a gambling activity. There are three race courses in Malaysia, namely [[Penang Turf Club]], Perak Turf Club and [[Selangor Turf Club]]. Within and only within the turf clubs, betting on horse racing is a legal form of gambling. Racing in Malaysia and [[Singapore]] is conducted and governed under the Rules of the Malayan Racing Association and betting in Malaysia is operated and organized by Pan Malaysian Pools Sdn Bhd.

====Mongolia====
[[Mongolia]]n horse racing takes place during the [[Naadam]] festival. Mongolia does not have Thoroughbred horse racing.  Rather, it has its own Mongolian style of horse racing in which the horses run for at least a distance of 25 kilometers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thingsasian.com/stories-photos/3743 |title=Mongolian horse racing |publisher=Thingsasian.com |date=2006-07-13 |accessdate=2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pakistan====
Horse races are held in [[Pakistan]] at four different clubs. In Lahore at [[Lahore Race Club]], Rawalpindi at Chakri, in Karachi at [[Karachi Race Club]] and in Gujrat at [http://www.gujratraceclub.com Gujrat Race Club].

====Philippines====
{{Main|Horseracing in the Philippines}}
[[Horseracing in the Philippines]] began in 1867. The history of Philippine horseracing has three divisions according to the breeds of horses used. They are the Philippine-pony era (1867-1898), the Arabian-horse era (1898-1930), and the Thoroughbred-era (1935–present).&lt;ref name=PRC&gt;{{cite web|title=Landmark Dates|url=http://www.philracom.gov.ph/racing-info/history|publisher=Philippine Racing Commission|accessdate=8 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Singapore====
Horse racing was introduced to Singapore by the British during the colonial era and remained one of the legal forms of gambling after independence. It remains a highly popular form of entertainment with the local Singaporean community to this day. Races are typically held on Friday evenings and Sundays at the [[Singapore Turf Club]] in [[Kranji]]. Horse racing has also left its mark in the naming of roads in Singapore such as Race Course Road in [[Little India, Singapore|Little India]], where horse racing was first held in Singapore, and Turf Club Road in [[Bukit Timah]] where Singapore Turf Club used to be situated before moving to its current location in 1999.

====South Korea====
{{main|Horse racing in South Korea}}
Horse racing in South Korea dates back to May 1898, when a foreign language institute run by the government included a donkey race in its athletic rally. However, it wasn't until the 1920s that modern horse racing involving [[betting]] developed. The nation's first authorised club, the Chosun Racing Club, was established in 1922 and a year later, the [[Parimutuel betting|pari-mutuel betting system]] was officially adopted for the first time.&lt;ref name=ARFKorea/&gt;

The [[Korean War]] disrupted the development of horse racing in the country, but after the [[Seoul Olympics]] in 1988, the Olympic Equestrian Park was converted into racing facilities named [[Seoul Race Park]], which helped the sport to develop again.&lt;ref name=ARFKorea/&gt;

====United Arab Emirates====
The big race in the [[United Arab Emirates|UAE]] is the [[Dubai World Cup]], a race with a purse of US$10 million, which was the largest purse in the world until being surpassed by the [[Pegasus World Cup]], an American race with a $12 million purse that held its first edition in 2017. Other races include the [[Dubai Kahayla Classic]] with a purse of US$250,000.

The Meydan Racecourse in Dubai, reported to be the world's largest race track, opened on March 27, 2010 for the Dubai World Cup race. The race track complex contains two tracks with seating for 60,000, a hotel, restaurants, theater and museum.

There is no parimutuel betting in the UAE as gambling is illegal.&lt;ref name=Telovation/&gt;

===South America===
====Argentina====
In Argentina the sport is known as turf. Some of the most famous racers are Irineo Leguisamo, Vilmar Sanguinetti, Marina Lezcano, Jorge Valdivieso, Pablo Falero and Jorge Ricardo.
The Carlos Gardel's tango [[Por una cabeza]] is about horse racing, sport of which he was a known fan. Gardel was a good friend of Irineo Leguisamo, who is the most recognized Argentine jockey.

==Betting==
{{main|Betting on horse racing}}
[[File:Betting on the Favorite.jpg|thumb|right|''Betting on the Favorite'', an 1870 [[wood engraving|engraving]]]]
At many horse races, there is a gambling station, where gamblers can stake money on a horse. Gambling on horses is prohibited at some tracks; Springdale Race Course, home of the nationally renowned [[Toronto-Dominion Bank]] (TD Bank) Carolina Cup and Colonial Cup Steeplechase in [[Camden, South Carolina]], is known as one of the tracks where betting is illegal, due to a 1951 law. Where gambling is allowed, most tracks offer [[parimutuel betting]] where gamblers' money is pooled and shared proportionally among the winners once a deduction is made from the pool. In some countries, such as the UK, Ireland, and Australia, an alternative and more popular facility is provided by [[bookmaker]]s who effectively [[Market maker|make a market]] in odds. This allows the gambler to 'lock in' odds on a horse at a particular time (known as 'taking the price' in the UK). [[Parimutuel betting|Parimutuel]] [[gambling]] on races also provides not only purse money to participants but considerable tax revenue, with over $100 billion wagered annually in 53 countries.&lt;ref name="NTRA"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ntra.com/content/WTWG_final_report.pdf |format= PDF |title= Improving Security in the United States Pari-Mutuel Wagering System: Status Report and Recommendations |accessdate= 2008-02-17 |author= NTRA Wagering Technology Working Group in conjunction with Giuliani Partners LLC |date= August 2003 |work= National Thoroughbred Racing Association Web Site |publisher= National Thoroughbred Racing Association |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080228005111/http://www.ntra.com/content/WTWG_final_report.pdf |archivedate= 2008-02-28 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Organized groups dedicated to protecting animals, such as the [[Humane Society of the United States]] and [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]], target some horse sports with claims of [[animal cruelty]]. Horse racing and [[rodeo]] are most commonly targeted,{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} due both to their high visibility and to the level of stress and potential physical dangers to the equines involved.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Criticism of horse racing and its practices runs a wide gamut;{{Vague|date=February 2009}} however, while some may consider even fairly drastic discipline of horses non-abusive, others may consider abuse to be anything done against the will of the animal in question. Some people may consider poor living conditions or use of whip abusive, while some may have concern with end-use of horses.

In 2009, [[animal rights]] group [[PETA]] released undercover video of alleged abuses of former race horses at a slaughterhouse in [[Kumamoto]], [[Japan]]. The group stated that "as many as 20,000" horses, including former Thoroughbred race horses, were killed in 2008 in Japan for use as human and pet food&lt;ref name="kumamoto"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://secure.peta.org/site/Advocacy?cmd=display&amp;page=UserAction&amp;id=2103|title= Slaughterhouses: Where Racehorses Go to Retire| author = PETA| accessdate=2009-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the official figure for 2008 was 15,003 horses).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maff.go.jp/j/chikusan/kikaku/lin/pdf/27_zentai.pdf H27 Horse-Related Data (Whole Edition)(Pg. 71)](In Japanese)&lt;/ref&gt; Based on findings of 2009 and fate of 1986 Kentucky Derby Winner [[Ferdinand (horse)|Ferdinand]], PETA has called ban for exporting race horses to Japan,&lt;ref name="kumamoto"/&gt; even though the amount of young horses exported to Japan for racing purposes is insignificant compared to the overall amount&lt;ref&gt;104 in year 2015,(JAIRS)&lt;/ref&gt; and only adult horses exported to Japan are breeding stock.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jairs.jp/contents/tokei/tokei_yunyuu_sa.html JAIRS Statistics](in Japanese)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dangers==
[[File:Tony McCoy fall.jpg|thumb|Jockey [[Tony McCoy]] falls from a horse.]]

There are many dangers in horse racing for both horse and jockey: a horse can stumble and fall, or fall when jumping an obstacle, exposing both jockey and horse to the danger of being trampled and injured.

Anna Waller, a member of the Department of Emergency Medicine at the University of North Carolina, co-authored a four-year-long study of jockey injuries and stated to the New York Times that "For every 1,000 jockeys you have riding [for one year], over 600 will have medically treated injuries." She added that almost 20% of these were serious head or neck injuries. The study reported 6,545 injuries during the years 1993–1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Joe DrapePublished: February 02, 2002 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950CE0D8143DF931A35751C0A9649C8B63 |title=On Horse Racing; Recent Spills Underline Dangers of the Sport |publisher=New York Times |date=2002-02-02 |accessdate=2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/283/10/1326.long |title=JAMA Network &amp;#124; JAMA &amp;#124; Jockey Injuries in the United States |publisher=Jama.ama-assn.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 100 jockeys were killed in the US between 1950 and 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/HorseJockey/ |title=Safety and Health in the Horse Racing Industry |publisher=Cdc.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Horses also face [[Welfare and Safety of the Racehorse|dangers]] in racing. 1.5 horses die out of every 1000 starts in the US. The U.S. Jockey Club in New York estimates that about 600 horses died at racetracks in 2006. The Jockey Club in Hong Kong reported a far lower figure of .58 horses per 1000 starts.  There is speculation that drugs used in horse racing in the US which are banned elsewhere are responsible for the higher death rate in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Marx |first=Willem |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/Story?id=2857650&amp;page=3 |title=Danger Out of the Gate What's Behind the High Rate of Deaths Among U.S. Racehorses? |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2007-02-08 |accessdate=2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[curling]], the '''lead''' is the person who delivers the first two stones of the end for their team. On most teams, where the lead does not act as [[skip (curling)|skip]] or [[vice (curling)|vice]], the lead will sweep for each of their teammates. Because of the free-guard rule, which prevents leads from removing most of an opponents stones, leads are usually proficient at throwing guards and other draws, and throw few takeouts or other power shots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weeks|first=Bob|title=Curling For Dummies Cheat Sheet|url=http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/curling-for-dummies-cheat-sheet.html|accessdate=17 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some regions, such as [[Eastern Ontario]] and the [[Eastern United States]], the lead is responsible for determining who has hammer, using random selection, such as flipping a coin. However, in most regions, this is the responsibility of the [[third (curling)|third]].

'''Lune Road Ground''' is a [[cricket]] ground in [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]], [[Lancashire]].  The ground is situated on the bank of the [[River Lune]].  The first recorded match on the ground was in 1907, when the [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire Second XI]] played [[Durham County Cricket Club|Durham]] in the [[Minor Counties Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/565_minc.html Minor Counties Championship Matches played on Lune Road Ground]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1914, the ground held its only [[first-class cricket|first-class]] match when [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire]] played [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]] in the [[1914 County Championship|County Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/565_f.html First-Class Matches played on Lune Road Ground]&lt;/ref&gt;

With the first recorded match on the ground in 1907 involving the Lancashire Second XI, the ground has since held a combined total of 9 Second XI fixtures for the Lancashire Second XI in the Minor Counties Championship, [[Second XI Championship]] and Second XI Trophy up to 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/565_sec.html Second XI Championship Matches played on Lune Road Ground]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/565_set.html Second XI Trophy Matches played on Lune Road Ground]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marylebone Cricket Club''' ('''MCC''') is a [[cricket]] club founded in 1787 and based since 1814 at [[Lord's]] cricket ground, which it owns, in [[St John's Wood]], London, England.

The club's own teams are essentially ''ad hoc'' because they have never taken part in any formal competition. MCC teams have always held [[First-class cricket|first-class status]] depending on the quality of the opposition. To mark the beginning of each English season, MCC plays the reigning [[County Championship|County Champions]].

In 1788, the MCC took responsibility for the [[Laws of Cricket]], issuing a revised version that year. Although changes to the Laws are now determined by the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC), the copyright is still owned by MCC.&lt;ref name=Laws&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lords.org/mcc/laws-of-cricket/ |title=Laws of Cricket |publisher=MCC |date=2016 |accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club was formerly the governing body of cricket in England and Wales and, as the sport's legislator, held considerable global influence.

For much of the 20th century, commencing with the [[English cricket team in Australia in 1903–04|1903–04 tour of Australia]] and ending with the [[English cricket team in India and Sri Lanka in 1976–77|1976–77 tour of India]], MCC organised international tours in which the [[England cricket team]] played [[Test cricket|Test matches]]. On these tours, the England team was called MCC in non-international matches. In 1993, its administrative and governance functions were transferred to the ICC and the [[Test and County Cricket Board]] (TCCB).

== History and role ==
===Origin===
The origin of MCC was as a gentlemen's club that had flourished through most of the 18th century, including, at least in part, an existence as the original [[London Cricket Club]], which had played at the [[Artillery Ground]] through the middle years of the century. Many of its members became involved with the [[Hambledon Club]] through the 1770s and then, in the early 1780s, had returned to the London area where the [[White Conduit Club]] had begun in [[Islington]]. It is not known for certain when the White Conduit was founded but it seems to have been after 1780 and certainly by 1785. According to [[Pelham Warner]], it was formed in 1782 as an offshoot from a [[West End of London|West End]] convivial club called the ''Je-ne-sais-quoi'', some of whose members frequented the White Conduit House in [[Islington]] and played matches on the neighbouring [[White Conduit Fields]], which had been a prominent venue for cricket in the 1720s.&lt;ref&gt;Warner, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthur Haygarth]] said in ''Scores and Biographies'' that "the Marylebone Club was founded in 1787 from the White Conduit's members" but the date of the formation of the White Conduit "could not be found".&lt;ref&gt;Haygarth, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

This gentlemen's club, which was multi-purpose, had a social meeting place at the ''Star and Garter'' on [[Pall Mall, London|Pall Mall]]. It was the same club that was responsible for drafting the [[Laws of Cricket]] at various times, most notably in 1744 and 1774, and this lawgiving responsibility was soon to be vested in the MCC as the final repose of these cricketing gentlemen. When the White Conduit began, its leading lights were [[George Finch, 9th Earl of Winchilsea]] (1752–1826) and the Hon. Colonel Charles Lennox (1764–1819), who later became the [[Charles Lennox, 4th Duke of Richmond|4th Duke of Richmond]]. White Conduit was nominally an exclusive club that only "gentlemen" might play for, but the club did employ professionals and one of these was the bowler [[Thomas Lord]], a man who was recognised for his business acumen (he became a successful wine and provisions merchant) as well as his bowling ability.&lt;ref&gt;Haygarth, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DB47&gt;Birley, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

The new club might have continued except that White Conduit Fields was an open area allowing members of the public, including the rowdier elements, to watch the matches and to voice their opinions on the play and the players. The White Conduit gentlemen were not amused by such interruptions and decided to look for a more private venue of their own.&lt;ref name=DB47/&gt; Winchilsea and Lennox asked Lord to find a new ground and offered him a guarantee against any losses he may suffer in the venture.&lt;ref name=HSA51&gt;Altham, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DB47/&gt; Lord took a lease from the [[Portman Estate]] on some land at Dorset Fields where [[Dorset Square]] is now sited; and [[Lord's Old Ground|the ground]] was prepared and opened in 1787. It was initially called the New Cricket Ground, perhaps because it was off what was then called "the New Road" in [[Marylebone]], when the first known match was played there on 21 May but, by the end of July, it was known as Lord's.&lt;ref name=GB110/&gt; As it was in Marylebone, the White Conduit members who relocated to it soon decided to call themselves the "Mary-le-bone Club".&lt;ref name=GB115/&gt; The exact date of MCC's foundation is lost but seems to have been sometime in the late spring or the summer of 1787.&lt;ref name=PW18&gt;Warner, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 &amp; 11 July 1837, a [[North v South|South v North]] match was staged at [[Lord's]] to commemorate the MCC's Golden Jubilee. Warner described it as "a Grand Match to celebrate the Jubilee of the Club" and reproduced the full scorecard.&lt;ref name=PW18/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Warner, pp. 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

On Wednesday, 25 April 1787, the London ''Morning Herald'' newspaper carried a notice: "The Members of the Cricket Club are desired to meet at the ''Star and Garter'', Pall Mall, on Mon., April 30. Dinner on table exactly at half past five o'clock. N.B. The favour of an answer is desired".&lt;ref name=GB110&gt;Buckley, ''FL18C'', p.110.&lt;/ref&gt; The agenda is unknown but, only three weeks later on Saturday, 19 May, the ''Morning Herald'' advertised: "A grand match will be played on Monday, 21 May in the New Cricket Ground, the New Road, Mary-le-bone, between eleven Noblemen of the White Conduit Club and eleven Gentlemen of the County of Middlesex with two men given, for 500 guineas a side. The wickets to be pitched at ten o'clock, and the match to be played out". No post-match report has been found but, as [[G. B. Buckley]] said, it was "apparently the first match to be played on Lord's new ground".&lt;ref name=GB110/&gt;

A total of eight matches are known to have been played at Lord's in 1787, one of them a [[single wicket cricket|single wicket]] event. The only one which featured the Mary-le-bone Club took place on Monday, 30 July. It was advertised in ''The World'' on Friday, 27 July 1787: "On Monday, 30 July will be played (at Lord's) a match between 11 gentlemen of the Mary-le-bone Club and 11 gentlemen of the Islington Club".&lt;ref name=GB115&gt;Buckley, ''FL18C'', p.115.&lt;/ref&gt; Buckley stated that "this is the earliest notice of the Marylebone Club".&lt;ref name=GB115/&gt; As with the inaugural match at Lord's, no post-match report of the inaugural MCC match has been found.

==Grounds==
[[File:Dorset square plaque.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A plaque in Dorset Square marks the site of the original Lord's Ground and commemorates the founding of the MCC]]
There have been three Lord's grounds: the original on the Portman Estate and two on the [[Eyre Estate]]. All three sites lie to the west of [[Regent's Park]]. Thomas Lord leased the original ground, now referred to as [[Lord's Old Ground]], from the Portman Estate in 1787 and MCC played there until 1810 when Lord, after objecting to a rent increase, decided on termination of the lease to lift his turf and move out.&lt;ref name=PW18/&gt; Over 200 matches are known to have been played there, mostly involving MCC and/or [[Middlesex county cricket teams|Middlesex]]. The Old Ground was on the site now occupied by [[Dorset Square]] which is east of [[Marylebone Station]] and west of [[Baker Street]]. To commemorate the association, a plaque was unveiled in Dorset Square on 9 May 2006 by [[Andrew Strauss]].

Lord had been aware some years before 1810 that the Portman Estate intended to let the site on building leases which would command the much higher rent of over £600 per annum.&lt;ref name=PW18/&gt; On 15 October 1808, he rented two fields in the North Bank area of the St John's Wood Estate, which belonged to Richard Eyre, a local landowner after whom [[Eyre's Tunnel]] on the [[Regent's Canal]] was named. Rental on the Eyre site was only £54 per annum for a term of eighty years and free of both land tax and tithe.&lt;ref&gt;Warner, p. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The new ground was ready for use in 1809 and so Lord had two grounds at his disposal for the 1809 and 1810 seasons. The North Bank ground was sub-let to [[St John's Wood Cricket Club]], which eventually merged with MCC.&lt;ref name=PW19&gt;Warner, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Lord officially took over his second ground on 8 May 1811 by literally re-laying there his turf from the Old Ground. He did this so that "the noblemen and gentlemen of the MCC should be able to play on the same footing as before".&lt;ref name=PW19/&gt; According to Warner, however, the relocation was unpopular with many MCC members and, as a result, the club played no matches there in either 1811 or 1812.&lt;ref name=PW19/&gt; This may have been so but cricket generally was in decline at the time because of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. The [[Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians]] (the ACS) holds that "(from) 1810 to 1814 the game was all but dead", largely because of the war and "the very real threat of civil unrest in England".&lt;ref name=ACS4&gt;ACS, ''Important Matches'', p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The second venue is now generally known as [[Lord's Middle Ground]]. In the three years that Lord controlled it, only six matches are known to have taken place there and just three of these (all in 1813) involved MCC. The Middle Ground's exact location is uncertain but it is understood to have been in North Bank at the north end of [[Lisson Grove]] and that the Regent's Canal has been cut through it. This means that it was partially on the canal route and somewhere in the area now bounded by Lisson Grove (the B507) to south-west, Lodge Road to north-west, Park Road ([[A41 road|the A41]]) to north-east and the Regent's Canal to south-east. It was less than 300 [[metre]]s from the site of the modern [[Lord's]] ground.&lt;ref name=PW19/&gt;

Lord was forced to abandon the Middle Ground because of the canal construction. The decision on the route was made by Parliament in 1813. Lord approached the Eyre family who were willing to lease him another plot nearby in [[St John's Wood]], but at an increased rent of £100 per annum. Lord accepted and again removed and relaid his turf in time for the start of the 1814 season. This third ground was the present [[Lord's]], now home to MCC for over 200 years.&lt;ref name=PW19/&gt;

==''Laws of Cricket''==
{{Main|Laws of Cricket}}
MCC is the custodian of, and remains the copyright holder of, the ''[[Laws of Cricket]]''. Its Laws sub-committee is responsible for debating and drafting changes to the Laws, with the Main Committee then voting on any changes proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MCC AND THE LAWS OF CRICKET|url=https://www.lords.org/mcc/laws-of-cricket/introduction/|website=lords.org|accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
[[File:MCC member.jpg|right|thumb|175px|MCC member in distinctive MCC colours]]
MCC has 18,000 full members and 5,000 associate members. Members have voting rights and can use the [[Lord's Pavilion|Pavilion]] and other stands at Lord's to attend all matches played at the ground.&lt;ref name=HTJ&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lords.org/mcc/the-club/mcc-membership-how-to-join/|title=MCC Membership - How to Join - Lord's|publisher=Lords.org|accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to join the waiting list of candidates for membership one must obtain the vote (of which each full member has one a year) of three members, and the additional sponsorship of a person on the List of MCC Sponsors (which consists of members of all MCC Sub-Committees; MCC Committee; MCC Out-Match Representatives; and the Current, Past, and Designate President). As the demand for membership always outstrips supply each year, there continues to be a substantial waiting list for Full Ordinary Membership, currently around 27 years.&lt;ref name=HTJ/&gt; There are, however, ways to lessen the time it takes to become a full member: one may qualify as a Playing Member, or Out-Match Member (although this carries none of the privileges of membership, apart from being able to play for the club).&lt;ref name=HTJ/&gt; In addition, membership rules allow a certain number of people each year to be elected ahead of their turn; beneficiaries have included Sir [[Mick Jagger]] and, notably, in 2018 prime minister [[Theresa May]]. MCC also grants limited honorary membership to people who have had distinguished cricket careers. The club was a male-only bastion until the 1990s but it now recognises achievement in [[women's cricket]] with, for example, [[Charlotte Edwards]] an inductee in the 2010s.&lt;ref name=HTJ/&gt;

==Controversies==
The club's members persistently refused to allow female membership well into the 1990s, with club ballots on the change unable to attract the two-thirds majority amongst the membership required for implementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/cricket/181459.stm|title=
MCC set to accept women|publisher=BBC|date=27 September 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move to change was spearheaded by [[Rachael Heyhoe Flint, Baroness Heyhoe Flint|Rachael Heyhoe Flint]] who applied as "R Flint" to slip into the male-only application system. A 70% majority of members eventually voted to allow female membership in September 1998, so ending 212 years of male exclusivity, and 10 honorary life members were immediately admitted, including Heyhoe Flint. Up until this time, [[Elizabeth II|the Queen]], who is the club's patron, was the only woman (other than domestic staff) permitted to enter the Pavilion during play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/297853.stm|title=MCC delivers first 10 maidens|publisher=BBC|date=16 March 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1999, five women were invited to join as playing members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/cricket/277627.stm|title=Five maidens join Lord's|publisher=BBC|date=11 February 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further controversy occurred in 2005 when the club was criticised (including by a few of its own members)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/0,1563,1673091,00.html |title=ECB in Knott over TV deal |publisher=The Guardian |date=23 December 2005 |location=London |first=Paul |last=Kelso |accessdate=12 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; for siding with the [[England and Wales Cricket Board]] (ECB) over the latter's decision to award television rights for [[Test cricket]] to [[British Sky Broadcasting]], thus removing Test cricket from terrestrial television. The Secretary and Chief Executive of MCC at the time, [[Roger Knight]], represented the club on the board of the ECB and was party to this controversial and much criticised decision,{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} prior to which Test cricket had been shown free to viewers on British television for more than half a century.

Another controversy was MCC's decision to allow members and other spectators to continue to bring limited amounts of alcoholic drinks into the ground at all matches. This decision challenged the [[International Cricket Council|ICC]], which was attempting to implement a ban on this practice at all international matches around the world. MCC has opted to write to the ICC on an annual basis to seek permission for members and spectators to import alcohol into [[Lord's]]. No other Ground Authority has thought it necessary to seek permission from the ICC for their members and spectators to import alcohol into their cricket ground, there being money to be made out of selling alcohol themselves.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Given its heritage, MCC continues to participate in the administration of English cricket, and in 2010 offered Lord's as a neutral venue for Pakistan to stage a "home" [[Test cricket|Test match]], as scheduled by the ICC, versus Australia; the club's initial offering was made with the intention that Pakistan, whose terrorist-stricken country had rendered it a no-go area for international cricket, could remain within the international cricketing fold.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

The Secretary &amp; Chief Executive of the club has a place on the administrative board of the England and Wales Cricket Board and it is reported that [[Keith Bradshaw (cricketer)|Keith Bradshaw]] (the outgoing Secretary &amp; Chief Executive) may have been influential in the removal from office of England Coach [[Duncan Fletcher]] in April 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/england/6608545.stm|title=England to limit coach's powers|publisher=BBC|date=30 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, MCC made headlines over a controversial redevelopment plan, ''Vision for Lord's'', that would have increased capacity but included construction of residential flats on some of the MCC site. Internal strife over the process of making a decision on the proposal led to the resignation of former prime minister [[John Major]] from the main committee.&lt;ref name=Tel&gt;{{cite news|last=Hoult|first=Nick|title=New MCC chief executive Derek Brewer starting afresh on the controversial Vision for Lord's|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/9265199/New-MCC-chief-executive-Derek-Brewer-starting-afresh-on-the-controversial-Vision-for-Lords.html|accessdate=2 March 2013|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=15 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Today==
===Coaching===
[[File:MCC Coaching book.jpg|right|thumb|125px|[[MCC coaching manual]]s]]
MCC has long had a deep involvement in coaching the game of cricket. The club's head coach leads an extensive operation involving the running of an indoor-cricket school and a team of coaches in England and around the world. The club has traditionally produced a coaching manual, the ''[[MCC Cricket Coaching Book]]'', a bible for cricket skills, and runs training programmes for young cricketers, including many at its Lord's Indoor Centre.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} MCC continues to tour around England, playing matches against various state and private schools. This tradition has been followed since the 19th century. The club has other sporting interests with both a [[real tennis]] and a [[Squash (sport)|squash]] court on site at Lord's, and [[golf]], [[chess]], [[Bridge (card game)|bridge]] and [[backgammon]] societies.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

===Club colours===
From the beginning of the 20th century, MCC organised the [[England cricket team]] and, outside [[Test cricket|Test matches]], the touring England team officially played as "MCC" up to and including the 1976/77 tour of India. The [[England cricket team|England touring team]] wore the distinctive red and yellow stripes of the Marylebone Cricket Club as their colours for the last time on the [[English cricket team in New Zealand in 1996–97|tour to New Zealand in 1996/97]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

The true provenance of MCC's colours is (and probably will remain) unknown, but its players often turned out sporting sky blue until well into the 19th century. The club eventually settled on the now well-recognised colours of scarlet and gold.&lt;ref&gt;Rule 1 of the MCC club rules (dated 1 July 2013) states, "The club shall be called the Marylebone Cricket Club and its colours shall be Scarlet and Gold".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Para 7 of the Royal charter states, "The colours of the club shall be scarlet and gold"&lt;/ref&gt; One theory is that MCC adopted these colours from [[J&amp;W Nicholson &amp; Co]]'s [[gin]] after the company's chairman, MCC benefactor [[William Nicholson (distiller)|William Nicholson]] (1825–1909), secured the club's position at Lord's with a loan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Williams |first=Glenys |title=The colours of MCC |work=About MCC |publisher=Marylebone Cricket Club |url=http://www.lords.org/mcc/about-mcc/the-colours-of-mcc,1045,AR.html |accessdate=19 July 2009 |quote=William Nicholson continued to loan the club substantial amounts for numerous projects over the next 30 years and was President of MCC in 1879. William Nicholson was the owner of the Nicholson's Gin Company, the colours of which were red and yellow. Although no written proof has yet been found there is a strong family tradition that the adoption of the red and gold was MCC's personal thank you to William Nicholson for his services to the club - sport's first corporate sponsorship deal perhaps! |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090602022559/http://www.lords.org/mcc/about-mcc/the-colours-of-mcc,1045,AR.html |archivedate=2 June 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory, which chimes with the club's origins, is that MCC borrowed its colours from the livery colours (racing) of a founding patron, [[Charles Lennox, 4th Duke of Richmond]], of [[Goodwood House|Goodwood]] fame.&lt;ref name="Lads to Lord's"&gt;{{cite web|title=From Lads to Lord's, The History of Cricket: 1781 – 1786: 1787 – Lord's and the MCC|last=Leach|first=John|year=2007|accessdate=20 December 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629140319/http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1787.html|archivedate=29 June 2011|url=http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1787.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Image===
Often viewed as overly staid and pontifical (i.e. "[[The Establishment|Establishment]]"), the club has of late improved its image in the eyes of the public and media, partly because it remains a citadel for tradition in a fast-changing landscape and partly because it has made a concerted move towards image-improvement. "It would be overstating things to claim that the MCC has come full circle," admitted Andrew Miller at the beginning of October 2008, "but at a time of massive upheaval in the world game, the... colours of NW8 have ceased to represent everything that is wrong with cricket, and instead have become a touchstone for those whose greatest fear is the erosion of the game's traditional values."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content-www.cricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/371969.html|title=We're riding the crest of a cricket revolution|last=Miller|first=Andrew|date=1 October 2008|work=[[Cricinfo]]|accessdate=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Status===
Until 2013 the MCC was a private members club (and this meant that it had the status of an [[Unincorporated associations in English law|unincorporated association]]).&lt;!-- Apparant conflict in dates with following paragraph is because, although the charter was granted in December 2012, it did not come into effect until 1 July 2013.---&gt; This status had several limitations. Since an unincorporated association is not a legal entity, it could not own property (such as Lord's Cricket Ground itself) in its own name. It could not sue anybody, or indeed be sued (any legal action had to be taken against the Secretary &amp; Chief Executive personally). In the event that a claim was successful, the committee and even the members themselves would have had to fund any financial shortfall. The club therefore called a Special General Meeting in June 2012 to consider petitioning the Queen in Council to incorporate the club by [[Royal charter|Royal Charter]].&lt;ref&gt;Notice of Special General Meeting to be held on 25 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The charter would remove many of the barriers and simplify the administration of the club.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Resulting from the petition, in December 2012 the club was granted a Royal charter, two previous attempts having been unsuccessful. As a result, the club became an incorporated association and is now able to hold assets, including the Lord's ground, in its own name instead of via a custodian trustee. It also meant that the individual members, as the club's owners, no longer have a potential liability should the club ever get into serious financial trouble.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sport in Brief: Cricket |work=The Daily Telegraph |page=S21 |date=15 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==MCC Universities==
Since 2005 the MCC has funded six university cricket academies known as the MCC Universities (MCCUs). (Prior to 2010 they were known as the University Centres of Cricketing Excellence (UCCEs).) They are based at [[Cambridge University Cricket Club|Cambridge]], [[Cardiff MCC University|Cardiff]], [[Durham MCC University|Durham]], [[Leeds/Bradford MCC University|Leeds/Bradford]], [[Loughborough MCC University|Loughborough]] and [[Oxford University Cricket Club|Oxford]], and incorporate a total of thirteen educational establishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lords.org/mcc/youth-cricket/mcc-universities/ |title= MCC Universities - investing in a cricketing education |work=www.lords.org |publisher= |date= |accessdate=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2012}}, all six MCCUs have been granted first-class status by the ECB. Each MCCU plays a trio of matches against professional county sides at the beginning of each season, with first-class status conferred on the first two of these matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecb.co.uk/news/domestic/mccus,316455,EN.html |title=All MCCUs granted first-class status |publisher=ECB |accessdate=16 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305191640/http://www.ecb.co.uk/news/domestic/mccus,316455,EN.html |archivedate=5 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Officers of the club==
Presidents serve a twelve-month term and cannot normally serve two terms in succession. Notable exceptions occurred during [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. In 1914, [[Martin Hawke, 7th Baron Hawke|Lord Hawke]] was appointed President and was asked to remain in the post till the end of the war.&lt;ref name="P&amp;D"&gt;Pope &amp; Dyson, pp. 50–51.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Hawke was MCC President for five years from 1914 to 1918 inclusive and was succeeded in 1919 by the former Hampshire slow left-arm bowler [[Henry Forster, 1st Baron Forster|Henry Forster]], who shortly afterwards succeeded to the title of Lord Forster of Lepe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ww1talk.co.uk/showthread.php?1543-Southend-John-and-Alfred-Forster-WW1-War-Memorial |publisher=World War I Talk |title=Southend - John and Alfred Forster WW1 War Memorial |accessdate=24 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the war, Lord's was used for military purposes, including training and recreation. Problems frequently arose but, in ''Wisden's'' view, Hawke was "the greatest help in giving wise counsel towards their solution".&lt;ref name="wistrib"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/151836.html |work=Wisden Cricketers' Almanack |year=1939 |title=The late Lord Hawke |accessdate=21 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hawke's tenure was exceeded by that of [[Stanley Christopherson]] who was appointed in 1939 and remained ''in situ'' for seven years until 1945 before he was succeeded by [[Ronald Forbes Adam|General Ronald Adam]].&lt;ref name=BWC49&gt;Barclay, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Barclays World of Cricket'' essay about the MCC Presidency, [[E. W. Swanton]] said that "there is no pretence of democracy about it" and commented on how few were untitled up to the Second World War. As he said, membership of the aristocracy was a more important factor than any cricketing prowess.&lt;ref&gt;Barclay, pp. 48–49.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 21st century there have been MCC Presidents who as players were wholly professional: [[Tom Graveney]], [[Derek Underwood]], [[Mike Gatting]] and [[Matthew Fleming]].

Each President is required to nominate his successor at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) which takes place during his term of office.&lt;ref&gt;Rules of the Marylebone Cricket Club (1 July 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; The club chairman and the treasurer serve a three-year term. Both are appointed by the committee (but subject to approval of the voting members). Both can serve terms in succession. The secretary and chief executive (a joint role) is the senior employee of the club and is appointed solely by the MCC committee.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

The committee consists of the above officers plus the chairmen of any other committees that may exist at the time of any meeting plus twelve elected members. Elected committee members are appointed for a three-year term. An elected committee member cannot be re-elected upon retirement unless there is a gap of at least one year between terms of office.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

'''McCracken Park''' is a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in [[Gosforth]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], [[England]].  It is currently used mostly for [[rugby union]] matches and is the home stadium of [[Northern Football Club]].

== The ground ==
The ground is named after Angus McCracken, who was the Club President when it was built. It was officially opened by Ald. G. B. Bainbridge in October 1937.&lt;ref name="home"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.northernfc.co.uk/ |title=Home |publisher=Northern FC |accessdate=2009-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956 squash courts were built in addition to the clubhouse. In 1961 a cocktail bar was also added. A third squash court was added in 1974. The current clubhouse was opened on 18 December 1994 at the cost of £1 million. This included a fourth glass-back squash court, a new members bar and a functions bar.&lt;ref name="home"/&gt;

'''Stadion na Koniku''' (Stadium on Konik) is situated at the southwest part of Konik, a southeastern suburb of [[Podgorica]], at the Ćemovsko Polje, the ‘only desert in Montenegro’. Stadium was built at 1970's, and today it has one stand with capacity of 750 seats (‘east stand’). At the east side of the stadium is Cafe bar ‘Ribnica’, a modern café, where all fans of [[FK Ribnica]] gather before and after the match. The stadium is situated in the zone where in the  future will be the ‘New town’. So, the actual ‘face’ of stadium will be changed. It is planned adding two big stands with 6.000 places, as well as many shops and the shopping center in the vicinity.

==Tournaments==
At the past time, stadium was home ground for few local tournaments. Nowadays, every year in February, Stadion na Koniku is home of [[Memorial tournament 'Gojko Lopičić']].

[[Chile]] has many beaches for [[surfing]], especially in the northern region where the weather conditions attract many surfers from all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsurfnews.com/news.asp?Id_news=34709]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527045132/http://www.globalsurfnews.com/news.asp?Id_news=34709 |date=May 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Except for the winter months (July and August) surfing is possible all year. The water temperature ranges from 15 to 20&amp;nbsp;°C (59 to 68&amp;nbsp;°F). 
Although the waves in central Chile are bigger, the waves in the north are stronger and are usually better suited for surfing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsurfers.com/country_details.cfm?land=Chile |title=Surf spot guide for Chile free surf atlas presented by Global Surfers |publisher=Globalsurfers.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The cold waters of central and southern Chile can be brutal to surf, therefore, surfers adventuring into those areas are strongly advised on using a protective [[wetsuit]] to protect against the elements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mercuriovalpo.cl/prontus4_noticias/antialone.html?page=http://www.mercuriovalpo.cl/prontus4_noticias/site/artic/20041220/pags/20041220020822.html ]{{dead link|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gorp.com/weekend-guide/travel-ta-surfing-sidwcmdev_059717.html |title=Chile's Top 10 Adventures: Surf Endless Coastline |publisher=GORP.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the most popular surfing spots in Chile are:

== Pichilemu ==
{{main|Pichilemu}}
Located south west of Santiago, Pichilemu is the number one spot for surfing in Chile. The town is the host of the annual national championships. This location offers something for every kind of surfer. Beginners usually try to catch their first waves at the beaches of ''Las Terrazas'' or ''La Puntilla''. While more skilled usually hang out at Infiernillo, and only the most experienced surfers adventure into [[Punta de Lobos]] where the waves can get up to 6 meters high.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chilesurf.cl/2008/06/alerta-de-olas-para-chile.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207044804/http://www.chilesurf.cl/2008/06/alerta-de-olas-para-chile.html |date=December 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ritoque ==
Just north of Viña del Mar, Ritoque is one of Chile’s most beautiful places for surfing. On the 13 kilometer long Ritoque beach waves can get as high as 7 meters.

== Arica ==
{{main|Arica}}
Close by the city of Arica is the ''Playa [[Gringo]]'', whereas the name tells many US [[People of the United States|Americans]] go to surf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.surfline.com/surfnews/2005_07_27_chile.cfm|title=Pipeline comes to Chilean Big Wave Contest, BIG BUEY - Surfline|publisher=Surfline.com|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though there are spots with rocks in the water, the qualification for the national championship takes place there. Waves can get up to 4 meters high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.elmorrocotudo.cl/admin/render/noticia/20012 |title="Arica es para nosotros la Capital del Surf en Chile" &amp;#124; El Morrocotudo.cl , Noticias de Arica y Parinacota |publisher=Elmorrocotudo.cl |date= |accessdate=2014-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Totoralillo==
Totoralillo is located 12 km to the south of Coquimbo and 450 km at the north of Santiago. This Tahiti style beach, white sanded and clear water, offers all level surfers 6 different waves to enjoy: Derecharcha, Punta, Cabañas, Muro, Cacho and Pipe, right and left waves.
It counts with a surf school, and different cabins where to stay.

'''''Volunteer''''' was an American racing yacht built in 1887 for the [[America's Cup]] races. She was the victorious American defender of the seventh America's Cup match that same year against Scottish challenger ''[[Thistle (yacht)|Thistle]]''.

==Design==
''Volunteer'', a [[centerboard]] compromise [[sloop]], was designed by [[Edward Burgess (yacht designer)|Edward Burgess]] and built by [[Pusey &amp; Jones]] Shipbuilding Company at [[Wilmington, Delaware]] in 1887 for owner General [[Charles Jackson Paine|Charles J. Paine]] of the [[New York Yacht Club]].

''Volunteer'' was the first America's Cup yacht with an all steel frame and hull. Her deck was made of white pine.

==Career==
''Volunteer'' easily beat the 1886 America's Cup defender ''[[Mayflower (yacht)|Mayflower]]'' during the defender trials for the 1887 America's Cup and won both Cup races on September 27 and 30, 1887, against ''Thistle''. ''Volunteer'' was skippered by Captain Hank Haff with the assistance of Captains Terry, Berry and L. Jeffreys.

Soon after the Cup races, ''Volunteer'' was bought by [[John Malcolm Forbes]] (who also owned ''[[Puritan (yacht)|Puritan]]'') and was Re-rigged as a [[schooner]] in 1891.[[File:4a04495v.jpg|thumb|left|Damage after the 1893 grounding]] On August 21,1893 she went onto the rocks at Hadley's Harbor, Naushon Island, off the coast of Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Volunteer on the Rocks|last=|first=|date=August 22, 1893|work=New York Times|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Damage was extensive, as shown in the picture below. In 1894, in anticipation of racing with the British Valkyrie, she was returned to her original sloop rig.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Good Yacht Races Promised|last=|first=|date=February 4, 1894|work=New York Times|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was broken up at a New York junkyard in 1910.
