'''Adam Tomkins''' (born 28 June 1969) is an academic and politician based within Scotland. He is the [[John Millar Professor of Law|John Millar Professor of Public Law]] at the [[University of Glasgow School of Law]] and was elected a Member of the [[Scottish Parliament]] for [[Glasgow (Scottish Parliament electoral region)|Glasgow]] in the [[Scottish Parliament election, 2016]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nicola Sturgeon celebrates third term as Tories head for second place|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/uk/nicola-sturgeon-celebrates-third-term-as-tories-head-for-second-place-34690207.html|website=[[Belfast Telegraph]]|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is shadow cabinet secretary for communities, social security, the constitution and equalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scottish Conservative appointments for new parliamentary term|url=http://www.scottishconservatives.com/2016/05/scottish-conservative-appointments-for-new-parliamentary-term/|website=Scottish Conservative Party|accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 2015 Tomkins was constitutional advisor to the [[House of Lords]] [[Constitution Committee]]. From 2015 he has acted as constitutional advisor to the [[Scotland Office]] and [[Secretary of State for Scotland]] [[David Mundell]].

==Academia==
Tomkins was educated at [[Gillingham School]], the [[University of East Anglia]] ([[Bachelor of Laws|LL.B.]], 1990) and the [[London School of Economics]] ([[Master of Laws|LL.M.]], 1991).&lt;ref name="oxfordintellect"&gt;{{cite web | title=oxford INTELLECT: Adam Tomkins | url=http://www.oxfordintellect.com/faculty_tomkins.html | publisher=[[University of Oxford]] | accessdate=2009-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; He taught at the School of Law of [[King's College London]] between 1991 and 2000 and became a [[fellow]] at [[St Catherine's College, Oxford|St Catherine's College]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] in 2000, before being elected to the John Millar Chair of Law at Glasgow in 2003.&lt;ref name="oxfordintellect" /&gt;&lt;ref name="slbio"&gt;{{cite web | title=University of Glasgow :: School of Law :: Adam Tomkins | url=http://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/law/staff/adamtomkins/#/biography| publisher=[[University of Glasgow School of Law]] | accessdate=2009-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; His research interests lie in constitutional theory and history, British, EU and comparative constitutional law, and republicanism.&lt;ref name="slbio" /&gt;

Tomkins has published seven books&lt;ref name="oxfordintellect" /&gt; in the areas of [[constitutional law|constitutional]], [[administrative law|administrative]] and [[Law of the European Union|European Union]] law, including two, ''Public Law'' (2003) and ''British Government and the Constitution'' (2007, with Colin Turpin), which are amongst the most widely used by law students in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="ampersand"&gt;{{cite web | title=Ampersand Academics - Professor Adam Tomkins | url=http://www.ampersandstable.com/evoke/who/Professor-Adam-Tomkins/view| publisher=Ampersand Advocates | accessdate=2015-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tomkins was once a supporter of the group, [[Republic (political organisation)|Republic]], a British republican organisation advocating the replacement of the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|monarchy]] with a [[democratically elected]] [[head of state]],&lt;ref name="republic"&gt;{{cite web | title=Republic: Supporters | url=http://www.republic.org.uk/supporters/index.php | publisher=[[Republic (political organisation)|Republic]] | accessdate=2009-05-31 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531162033/http://republic.org.uk/supporters/index.php | archivedate=31 May 2009 | deadurl=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tomkins published ''Our Republican Constitution'', a republican re-interpretation of the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom's constitution]]&lt;ref name="oxfordintellect" /&gt; which claims that the constitution is deeply influenced by republican principles, despite its monarchic nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=eBooks.com - Our Republican Constitution eBook | url=http://www.ebooks.com/ebooks/book_display.asp?IID=270763 | publisher=eBooks.com | accessdate=2009-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2015, he had distanced himself from his republican beliefs and said that "in terms of getting rid of the Queen and having a presidency, I'm probably not signed up to that anymore, because I just don't see the point".&lt;ref name="herald" /&gt;

Tomkins has held visiting appointments at the Universities of [[University of Toronto|Toronto]], [[University of Queensland|Queensland]] and [[University of New South Wales|New South Wales]] and the [[Australian National University]], and has lectured throughout the world.&lt;ref name="ampersand" /&gt; In April 2009, Tomkins became associated with Ampersand, a stable at the [[Faculty of Advocates]], as part of its ''Ampersand Academics'' link between practitioners and academics. Professor Douglas Brodie, former head of the [[University of Edinburgh School of Law|School of Law]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]], has also joined this project. In 2009 he was appointed legal adviser to the [[House of Lords]] [[Constitution Committee (House of Lords)|Constitution Committee]]. He was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] in 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rse.org.uk/fellow/adam-tomkins/|title=Professor Adam Tomkins FRSE, MSP - The Royal Society of Edinburgh|work=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|access-date=2018-02-09|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Politics==
Prior to his Conservative political career, Tomkins professed republican beliefs.&lt;ref name="herald"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/13411783.From_Roundhead_to_Cavalier__how_Tory_Scottish_Secretary_s_advisor_wanted_to_axe_the_Royal_family/|title=From Roundhead to Cavalier: how Tory Scottish Secretary's advisor wanted to axe the Royal family|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2014 Scottish [[Scottish independence referendum, 2014|independence referendum]] Tomkins was a leading unionist campaigner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Duffy|first1=Judith|title='I am being forced to choose ... would I want to stay in an independent Scotland as a No voter?'|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/13170868._I_am_being_forced_to_choose_____would_I_want_to_stay_in_an_independent_Scotland_as_a_No_voter__/|accessdate=29 October 2015|publisher=HeraldScotland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the referendum Tomkins was one of two [[Scottish Conservative]] representatives appointed to the [[Smith Commission]]. He has also been appointed as unpaid adviser to [[Secretary of State for Scotland]] [[David Mundell]] during the passage of the [[Scotland Bill 2015–16|Scotland Bill]] through parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Constitutional expert appointed as Mundell adviser|url=http://www.scottishlegal.com/2015/05/26/constitutional-expert-appointed-as-mundell-adviser/|website=Scottish Legal News|publisher=ScottishLegal.Com|accessdate=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2015, Tomkins announced his intention to stand as a [[Member of the Scottish Parliament]] for the [[Scottish Conservative Party|Scottish Conservatives]] in the [[Scottish general election, 2016|2016 elections]]. In a blog explaining his decision, he was highly critical of the [[Scottish National Party]]'s actions in [[government of the 4th Scottish Parliament|government]] at [[Scottish Parliament|Holyrood]], and praised many policies of the [[Premiership of David Cameron|Conservative government]] at [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster]], including [[Iain Duncan Smith]]'s "outstanding" benefit reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://notesfromnorthbritain.wordpress.com/2015/08/28/i-am-seeking-election-to-the-scottish-parliament-heres-why/|title=I am seeking election to the Scottish Parliament: here’s why|first=Prof Adam|last=Tomkins|date=28 August 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected a list member of the [[Scottish Parliament]] for [[Glasgow (Scottish Parliament electoral region)|the Glasgow Region]] in the [[Scottish Parliament election, 2016]].

'''Agnatic seniority''' is a [[patrilineality|patrilineal]] principle of [[inheritance]] where the [[order of succession]] to the throne prefers the monarch's younger brother over the monarch's own sons. A monarch's children (the next generation) succeed only after the males of the elder generation have all been exhausted. Agnatic seniority essentially excludes females of the [[dynasty]] and their descendants from the succession. Contrast [[Primogeniture#Agnatic primogeniture|agnatic primogeniture]], where the king's sons stand higher in succession than his brothers. &lt;!-- [[Primogeniture#Cognatic primogeniture]] --&gt;

In hereditary [[monarchy|monarchies]], particularly in more ancient times, seniority was a much-used principle of order of succession. The [[Ottoman Empire]] evolved from an elective succession (following the principle of agnatic seniority) to a succession inherited by the law of agnatic seniority.&lt;ref name="maine"&gt;{{cite book |title=Dissertations on Early Law and Custom |last=Maine |first=Henry Sumner |publisher=J. Murray |year=1891 |pages=145–6 |isbn=978-0-405-06522-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NEIUAAAAYAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In succession based on rotation (close to seniority), all (male) members of the dynasty were entitled to the monarchy, in principle. However, this tends to lead to situations where there is no clear rule to determine who is the next monarch.

Brothers succeeding each other as a system leads quickly, particularly in the following generations, to complex patterns and also to disputes between branches which have formed within the monarchical house. Monarchs had collateral relatives, some of whom were rather distant cousins, who were often as entitled to succeed as the monarch himself. Either one branch obtained sufficient control over others (often by force), the rival branches arrived at a balance (such as the succession becoming rotational), or the inheritance was somehow partitioned.

Succession based on agnatic seniority or rotation was often limited to those princes who were sons of an earlier reigning monarch. Thus a son of a king had a higher claim than a son of a prince. In some cases, distinctions were even made based on whether the claimant was born to a monarch who reigned at the time of birth ([[porphyrogeniture]]).

This limit was practical, as otherwise the number of rivals would be overwhelming. However, it usually left more than one rival who too often waged civil war against each other. In other cases, the eligible branches of dynasty became extinct in the male line (no surviving sons), in which situation the limit was problematic.

Sons of princes who did not live long enough to succeed to the throne were unsatisfied with such limits. This led to interpretation problems: What if a claimant's father was a rightful monarch, but not recognized by everyone, or by no one (did not rule at all)? The cases were further complicated by co-reigning monarchs, but this was often a practical solution to a controversial succession.

Agnatic seniority tends in the long run to favor a sort of [[ultimogeniture]], because princes born in a certain generation to the most junior lines tend to be more likely alive at the demise of the predecessor (the last of the immediately preceding generation). In a situation where representatives from any later generation are not allowed to succeed until the last ones of the earlier generation die, plenty of [[Dynasty#Dynasts|dynasts]], usually from more senior branches, will die before their turn on the throne. This tendency is one of the causes of disputed successions: some desire to succeed before they die, and plead the seniority or better blood of their branch. This is further exacerbated if a [[Dynasty#Dynasts|dynast]] is not allowed to succeed in case his father was not regnant (or is regarded just as a spare, eligible to succeed only after all those males whose fathers were regnant)—senior branches will with high likelihood sooner or later lose their places in succession. Agnatic seniority tends to favour boys who are born to fathers in their old age.

Succession within one family based on seniority was often a device to control an [[elective monarchy]]. Those two forms of monarchy (agnatic seniority and elective monarchy) were mostly used in the same centuries. Many kingdoms were officially elective long into historical times (though the election usually, or always, fell to family of the deceased monarch).

The preference for males which exists in most systems of [[hereditary succession]] came mostly from the perceived nature of the role of the monarch:

* Tribal chiefs (proto-monarchs) were required to personally participate in violent activities such as war, duels, and raiding expeditions.
* His income was dependent on the "protection money" or [[Corvée|corvee labour]] collected from those people he was supposed to protect from violence, both from outside (war) and from within (crime). The collection of these funds or services often required the threat or actual use of force by the monarch, but more politely labeled "taxes" and "duties". These forms of revenue-collecting are also present in non-monarchical systems.
* It was very useful, or even required, that the monarch be a warrior and a military commander. Warriors (almost always males) often would only accept other males as their commanders.
* Additionally, in some monarchies, the monarch held a certain mystical, almost priestly, position. That role, depending on the tradition in question, was often denied to females. In the French monarchy, one of the official explanations for the [[Salic Law]] was that the monarch was obliged to use certain sacred instruments, which females were forbidden even to touch.

In earlier centuries, perhaps in every second or every third generation on average, the male line often became extinct and females were needed to trace the line of succession. During this period, male lines tended to become extinct relatively quickly, usually due to violent death. Therefore, "pure" agnatic succession was impossible to maintain, and frequent exceptions were made—eligibility being granted to the eldest sons of sisters or other female relatives of the monarch.

The fully agnatic succession also did not serve the interests of individual monarchs who favoured close female relatives and their descendants over very distant male relatives.

In the later Middle Ages, violence directly involving the monarch and his heirs became less of a factor, as they gradually decreased their personal participation in combat. Sons were much more likely to survive to adulthood and to marry than in previous centuries, when many noble families lost adolescent sons to constant warfare. In addition, the living conditions and nutrition of the nobility improved, leading to fewer miscarriages and decreased infant and childhood mortality. Daughters were therefore needed less and less to trace succession.

In many cultures, [[surname]]s are agnatically determined.

==Historical examples==
Agnatic seniority and the [[rota system]] has been used in several historical monarchies. It was practiced by the [[Shang dynasty|Shang]] survivors who ruled [[state of Song|Song]] under the [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] in [[history of China|China]]. In [[Kievan Rus']] during the [[Rurikid]] Dynasty, it was implemented by Grand Prince [[Yaroslav I the Wise]] (1019–1054). In the Piast [[Kingdom of Poland (1025–1385)|Kingdom of Poland]], the [[Testament of Bolesław III Wrymouth]] enacted in 1138 with the establishment of a [[Seniorate Province]] at [[Kraków]] led to a centuries-long period of fragmentation of the country among his descendants. In [[Moravia]] and [[Bohemia]] since 1055 to 1182 respective 1203, established by duke [[Bretislaus I, Duke of Bohemia|Bretislaus I]] in his seniority "constitution". It was sometimes used in [[Morocco]] by the [[Alaouite dynasty]] until it was definitely abolished by King [[Mohammed V of Morocco|Mohammed V]] (1957–1961) who introduced [[agnatic primogeniture]].

The principle is currently used by the [[House of Saud]], the royal family of [[Saudi Arabia]]; all successors to [[Ibn Saud]] as [[King of Saudi Arabia]] have been his sons (he had 37 sons). Currently, as all remaining [[Line of succession to the Saudi Arabian throne|first-generation candidates]] are in their 70s and 80s, the [[Allegiance Council]] has been instituted to smooth the transition of power to the grandsons of Ibn Saud. The institution of the Allegiance Council arguably makes the succession formally [[Elective monarchy|elective]], but seniority remains the overriding factor, and it is expected that the most-senior dynast will be elected unless he is uninterested in the throne or otherwise disqualified.

In the succession for the [[Emperor of Ethiopia]], limitation to agnates was controlled until recent times. According to research by the historian Taddesse Tamrat, the order of succession during the [[Zagwe dynasty]] was that of brother succeeding brother as King of Ethiopia (i.e., agnatic seniority), which apparently was based on [[Agaw]] laws of [[inheritance]]. However, the principle of agnatic primogeniture later became dominant, although succession to the throne at the death of the monarch could be claimed by any male blood relative of the Emperor—sons, brothers, uncles or cousins. To avoid instability and civil war, an Emperor typically took care to designate his chosen heir, and to strengthen the heir's position against rivals. In addition, the Emperor would place the heir's rivals in a secure location, which drastically limited their ability to disrupt the Empire with revolts, or to dispute the succession of an heir apparent. Over time, Emperors were more frequently selected by a council of the senior officials of the realm, both secular and religious. The Ethiopian experience is a particularly good example of the instability which can result from the application of the principle of agnatic seniority.

The [[Counts and dukes of Anjou|County of Anjou]] followed inheritance by agnatic seniority. When [[Henry II of England]] married [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], creating the [[Angevin Empire]], this resulted in some question over what inheritance laws would affect their children, as Henry II's father was the count of Anjou, and he inherited England and Normandy through his mother. Henry II's eldest son the Young Henry died before him, so the throne passed to his next oldest son, [[Richard I of England]]. Henry II's third son [[Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany]] died three years before his father, but his pregnant wife later gave birth to a son, [[Arthur of Brittany]]. When Richard was mortally wounded during a castle siege, on his deathbed he named his brother [[John, King of England|John I of England]], Henry II's fourth and youngest son, as his heir. However, the inheritance was questioned by the young Arthur of Brittany (then 12 years old). Arthur argued that as the son of John's older brother Geoffrey, he was the rightful heir of Richard and Henry II according to the laws of agnatic primogeniture which were followed in England and Normandy. John countered that as the male-line heirs of the Counts of Anjou, the Angevin Empire followed the succession law of Anjou which was based on agnatic seniority. Thus, John claimed that as Richard's younger brother, he stood in line ahead of his nephew. Arthur continued to press his claim for the next four years, allying with the king of France against John, though Richard's deathbed declaration of John as his heir provided greater strength to his claim. Ultimately Arthur was captured in battle, imprisoned, and presumably killed by John. The matter was never definitively decided, as John lost all continental land possessions in France and had to relinquish any claim to rule of Anjou.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4064">'''Buttock mail''' was the [[colloquial]] term for a [[Scottish Poor Law]] tax which was introduced in 1595. Enforced by the [[ecclesiastical court]]s who had responsibility for the moral behaviour of the [[laity]], buttock mail was levied as a fine for sexual intercourse out of wedlock.

==Etymology==
In the 17th century, and perhaps earlier when the law that became known as buttock mail was passed, buttock was a colloquial term for a prostitute. The term mail is an [[old Scots]] word meaning a monetary tribute or payment, from the same root as the word [[blackmail]]. Thus, the term buttock mail literally means a monetary payment related to prostitution, referring to its being a fine for fornication, or sex outside of marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Grose|Partridge|1931|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Ecclesiastical courts had existed since the [[Norman conquest|Norman invasion]]. While secular courts were tasked with enforcing secular laws, the responsibility of the ecclesiastical courts was to enforce religious and moral laws. This included discipline of the clergy, enforcement of [[probate]] and [[wills]], as well as enforcement of laws that kept the laity within moral bounds. These ecclesiastical courts were very powerful until the late 17th century, when the [[Glorious Revolution]] removed much of their power. The remaining jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical courts was removed in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Cannon | first = John | title = The Oxford Companion to British History | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-19-860514-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fornication was against the law, and punishments were enforced by these ecclesiastical courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jamieson|1825|p=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; The normal punishment was a public confession through use of the [[Stool of Repentance]], but payment of buttock mail commuted this sentence, allowing the convicted fornicator to avoid public humiliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Smith, Sydney | title = The Edinburgh review: or critical journal, Volume 3 | publisher = A.

[[File:Cincinnati Freedom.jpg|thumb|right|Cincinnati Freedom]]
'''Cincinnati Freedom''' (c. 1995 – December 29, 2008), also known as '''Charlene Mooken''',{{cn|date=March 2017}} was a 1,050-pound [[Charolais cattle|Charolais]] cow that gained fame when, on February 15, 2002, she leaped over a six-foot fence at Ken Meyers Meats, a [[Camp Washington, Cincinnati|Camp Washington]] ([[Cincinnati]]) [[slaughterhouse]], and escaped. After eluding the traps and tranquilizer darts of [[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals|SPCA]] officials and police officers for 11&amp;nbsp;days, she was finally captured just after midnight on February 26 in [[Clifton, Cincinnati, Ohio]]. She lived out the rest of her life at [[Farm Sanctuary]]'s New York Shelter in [[Watkins Glen, New York|Watkins Glen]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and which was particularly popular with [[animal rights]] activists and animal lovers.

Finding a permanent home for her was a source of some debate, as most considered her no longer eligible for slaughter. The [[Cincinnati Zoo]] declined to house her, citing health concerns and the possibility that she could not be safely contained. Jan Malley, a Northern [[Kentucky]] woman with a {{convert|12|acre|m2|sing=on}} farm, was also considered as a possibility. In late March, however, artist [[Peter Max]] offered $180,000 worth of paintings to the SPCA for use at their next auction. In return, he took custody of the cow, whom he named to commemorate not only her dramatic pursuit of liberty, but the city into which she escaped.

Cincinnati Freedom received the key to [[Cincinnati]], but didn't wear it during the [[Cincinnati Reds]] Findlay Market Opening Day Parade on April 1, 2002, as planned, because she was judged too jumpy and nervous to participate. She was brought to her permanent home at Farm Sanctuary's New York Shelter on April 11, 2002, where she spent the rest of her life. She was reported to be doing well in the sanctuary and had apparently made a number of friends, including Queenie, a cow who escaped from a slaughterhouse in Queens, [[New York (state)|New York]], in 2000.

In 2008, Cincinnati Freedom developed [[spinal cancer]], an incurable and untreatable ailment in cows. She was euthanized on December 29, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://news.cincinnati.com/article/20090110/NEWS01/901100315 |title=Fugitive cow passes away |access-date=2009-01-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090112165455/http://news.cincinnati.com/article/20090110/NEWS01/901100315 |archive-date=2009-01-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldpeacediet.com/2009/01/cincinnati-freedom-the-fugitive-cow/ "Cincinnati Freedom, the fugitive cow" January 12, 2009, by Will Tuttle]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Compact disc''' ('''CD''') is a [[Digital media|digital]] [[optical disc]] [[data storage device|data storage]] format that was co-developed by [[Philips]] and [[Sony]] and released in 1982. The format was originally developed to store and play only sound recordings ([[CD-DA]]) but was later adapted for storage of data ([[CD-ROM]]). Several other formats were further derived from these, including write-once audio and data storage ([[CD-R]]), rewritable media ([[CD-RW]]), Video Compact Disc ([[VCD]]), Super Video Compact Disc ([[SVCD]]), [[Photo CD]], PictureCD, [[Green Book (CD standard)|CD-i]], and [[Enhanced Music CD]]. The first commercially available audio [[CD player]], the [[Sony CDP-101]], was released October 1982 in [[Japan]].

Standard CDs have a diameter of {{convert|120|mm|in}} and can hold up to about 80 minutes of uncompressed audio or about 700&amp;nbsp;[[MiB]] of data. The [[Mini CD]] has various diameters ranging from {{convert|60|to|80|mm|in}}; they are sometimes used for CD singles, storing up to 24 minutes of audio, or delivering [[device driver]]s.

At the time of the technology's introduction in 1982, a CD could store much more data than a [[personal computer]] [[hard drive]], which would typically hold 10 MB. By 2010, hard drives commonly offered as much storage space as a thousand CDs, while their prices had plummeted to commodity level. In 2004, worldwide sales of audio CDs, CD-ROMs and CD-Rs reached about 30 billion discs. By 2007, 200 billion CDs had been sold worldwide.&lt;ref name="AutoMR-1" /&gt;

From the early 2000s CDs were increasingly being replaced by other forms of digital storage and distribution, with the result that by 2010 the number of audio CDs being sold in the U.S. had dropped about 50% from their peak; however, they remained one of the primary distribution methods for the [[music industry]].&lt;ref name="AutoMR-2" /&gt;  In 2014, revenues from digital music services matched those from physical format sales for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=IFPI publishes Digital Music Report 2015|url=http://www.ifpi.org/news/Global-digital-music-revenues-match-physical-format-sales-for-first-time|access-date=1 July 2016|date=14 April 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414194629/http://www.ifpi.org/news/Global-digital-music-revenues-match-physical-format-sales-for-first-time|archivedate=14 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
American inventor [[James Russell (inventor)|James T. Russell]] has been credited with inventing the first system to record digital information on an optical [[transparency and translucency|transparent]] [[foil (metal)|foil]] that is lit from behind by a high-power halogen lamp.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|3,501,586}} Analog to digital to optical photographic recording and playback system, March 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|3,795,902}} Method and apparatus for synchronizing photographic records of digital information, March 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; Russell's patent application was first filed in 1966, and he was granted a patent in 1970. Following litigation, Sony and Philips licensed Russell's patents (then held by a Canadian company, Optical Recording Corp.) in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Seattle Times |url=http://seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2002103322_cdman29.html |author=Brier Dudley |title=Scientist's invention was let go for a song |date=29 November 2004 |access-date=24 July 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810225444/http://seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2002103322_cdman29.html |archivedate=10 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |date=2000 |publisher=Reed College public affairs office |title=Inventor and physicist James Russell '53 will receive Vollum Award at Reed's convocation |access-date=24 July 2014 |url=http://reed.edu/news_center/press_releases/2000-2001/288.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131009170700/http://www.reed.edu/news_center/press_releases/2000-2001/288.html |archivedate=9 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/russell.html |title=Inventor of the Week - James T.

The compact disc is an evolution of [[LaserDisc]] technology, where a focused [[laser]] beam
is used that enables the high information density required for high-quality digital audio signals.
Prototypes were developed by [[Philips]] and [[Sony]] independently in the late 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of the CD|url=https://www.philips.com/a-w/research/technologies/cd/beginning.html|publisher=Philips Research|access-date=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although originally dismissed by [[Philips Research]] management as a trivial pursuit,&lt;ref name="Immink2" /&gt; the CD became the primary focus for Philips as the [[LaserDisc]] format struggled.&lt;ref name="AndItsEnd"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Straw|first=Will|date=2009|title=The Music CD and Its Ends|url=|journal=Design and Culture|volume=1|issue=1|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, Sony and Philips set up a joint task force of engineers to design a new digital audio disc. After a year of experimentation and discussion, the ''[[Rainbow Books|Red Book]]'' [[Compact Disc Digital Audio|CD-DA]] standard was published in 1980. After their commercial release in 1982, compact discs and their players were extremely popular. Despite costing up to $1,000, over 400,000 CD players were sold in the United States between 1983 and 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spin.com/1985/05/compact-discs-sound-of-the-future/|title=Compact Discs: Sound of the Future|first=Edward|last=Rasen|work=Spin|access-date=9 January 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151216064105/http://www.spin.com/1985/05/compact-discs-sound-of-the-future/|archivedate=16 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1988, CD sales in the United States surpassed those of vinyl LPs, and by 1992 CD sales surpassed those of prerecorded music cassette tapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=CD Unit Sales Pass Cassettes, Majors Say|last=Billboard|first=|date=March 1992|work=Billboard|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Have Compact Disks Become Too Much of a Good Thing?|last=Kozinn|first=Allan|date=December 1988|work=The New York Times|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of the compact disc has been credited to the cooperation between [[Philips]] and [[Sony]], which together agreed upon and developed compatible hardware. The unified design of the compact disc allowed consumers to purchase any disc or player from any company, and allowed the CD to dominate the at-home music market unchallenged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tx6TYnPat8|title=Introducing the amazing Compact Disc (1982)|date=10 June 2015|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|access-date=9 January 2016|via=YouTube|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123170700/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tx6TYnPat8|archivedate=23 November 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Digital audio laser-disc prototypes ===
In 1974, Lou Ottens, director of the audio division of [[Philips]], started a small group with the aim to develop an analog&lt;ref name="Immink" /&gt; optical audio disc with a diameter of {{cvt|20|cm}} and a sound quality superior to that of the vinyl record.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laweekly.com/music/why-cds-may-actually-sound-better-than-vinyl-5352162 Why CDs may actually sound better than vinyl] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409132701/http://www.laweekly.com/music/why-cds-may-actually-sound-better-than-vinyl-5352162 |date=9 April 2016 }},
Chris Kornelis, 27 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the unsatisfactory performance of the analog format, two Philips research engineers recommended a digital format in March 1974.&lt;ref name="Immink" /&gt; In 1977, Philips then established a laboratory with the mission of creating a digital audio disc. The diameter of Philips's prototype compact disc was set at 11.5&amp;nbsp;cm, the diagonal of an audio cassette.&lt;ref name="Immink" /&gt;&lt;ref name=peek /&gt;

[[Heitaro Nakajima]], who developed an early digital audio recorder within Japan's national public broadcasting organization [[NHK]] in 1970, became general manager of [[Sony]]'s audio department in 1971. His team developed a digital [[PCM adaptor]] audio tape recorder using a [[Betamax]] video recorder in 1973. After this, in 1974 the leap to storing digital audio on an optical disc was easily made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kw0EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA68 | title=Heitaro Nakajima | work=Billboard | date=8 January 2000 | access-date=4 November 2014 | author=McClure, Steve | pages=68 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319065246/http://books.google.com/books?id=kw0EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA68 | archivedate=19 March 2015 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sony]] first publicly demonstrated an optical digital audio disc in September 1976. A year later, in September 1977, Sony showed the press a 30&amp;nbsp;cm disc that could play 60 minutes of digital audio (44,100&amp;nbsp;Hz sampling rate and 16-bit resolution) using [[Run-length limited|MFM]] modulation.&lt;ref name="SonyHistorical" /&gt; In September 1978, the company demonstrated an optical digital audio disc with a 150-minute playing time, 44,056&amp;nbsp;Hz sampling rate, 16-bit linear resolution, and [[Cross-interleaved Reed-Solomon coding|cross-interleaved]] [[error correction]] code—specifications similar to those later settled upon for the standard compact disc format in 1980. Technical details of Sony's digital audio disc were presented during the 62nd [[Audio Engineering Society|AES]] Convention, held on 13–16 March 1979, in [[Brussels]].&lt;ref name="SonyHistorical" /&gt; Sony's AES technical paper was published on 1 March 1979. A week later, on 8 March, Philips publicly demonstrated a prototype of an optical digital audio disc at a press conference called "Philips Introduce Compact Disc"&lt;ref name="BBC6950933" /&gt; in [[Eindhoven]], [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref name="PhilipsHistorical" /&gt;

=== Collaboration and standardization ===
[[File:schouhamerimmink.jpg|thumb|upright|Dutch inventor and Philips chief engineer [[Kees Schouhamer Immink]] was part of the team that produced the standard compact disc in 1980]]
Sony executive [[Norio Ohga]], later CEO and chairman of Sony, and [[Heitaro Nakajima]] were convinced of the format's commercial potential and pushed further development despite widespread skepticism.&lt;ref name="Ohgaobituary" /&gt;

As a result, in 1979, Sony and Philips set up a joint task force of engineers to design a new digital audio disc. Led by engineers [[Kees Schouhamer Immink]] and [[Toshitada Doi]], the research pushed forward [[laser]] and [[optical disc]] technology.&lt;ref name="BBC6950933" /&gt; After a year of experimentation and discussion, the task force produced the ''[[Rainbow Books|Red Book]]'' [[Compact Disc Digital Audio|CD-DA]] standard. First published in 1980, the standard was formally adopted by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] as an international standard in 1987, with various amendments becoming part of the standard in 1996.

Philips coined the term ''compact disc'' in line with another audio product, the [[Compact Cassette]],&lt;ref name=peek /&gt; and contributed the general [[manufacturing]] [[Industrial process|process]], based on video LaserDisc technology. Philips also contributed [[eight-to-fourteen modulation]] (EFM), which offers a certain resilience to defects such as scratches and fingerprints, while Sony contributed the [[error-correction]] method, [[Cross-Interleaved Reed-Solomon Coding|CIRC]].

The ''Compact Disc Story'',&lt;ref name="Immink" /&gt; told by a former member of the task force, gives background information on the many technical decisions made, including the choice of the sampling frequency, playing time, and disc diameter. The task force consisted of around four to eight persons,&lt;ref name="Immink2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Knopper" /&gt; though according to Philips, the compact disc was "invented collectively by a large group of people working as a team."&lt;ref name="PhilDoss" /&gt;

=== Initial launch and adoption ===
Philips established the Polydor Pressing Operations plant in [[Langenhagen]] near [[Hannover]], [[Germany]], and quickly passed a series of milestones.
* The first ''test pressing'' was of a recording of [[Richard Strauss]]'s ''[[An Alpine Symphony|Eine Alpensinfonie]]'' (''An Alpine Symphony'') played by the [[Berlin Philharmonic]] and conducted by [[Herbert von Karajan]], who had been enlisted as an ambassador for the format in 1979.&lt;ref name="Karajan" /&gt;
* The first ''public demonstration'' was on the [[BBC]] television programme ''[[Tomorrow's World]]'' in 1981, when the [[Bee Gees]]' album ''[[Living Eyes (Bee Gees album)|Living Eyes]]'' (1981) was played.&lt;ref name="AutoMR-4" /&gt;
* The first ''commercial'' compact disc was produced on 17 August 1982. It was ''[[The Visitors (ABBA album)|The Visitors]]'' (1981) by [[ABBA]].&lt;ref name="AutoMR-5" /&gt;
* The first 50 titles were ''released'' in Japan on 1 October 1982,&lt;ref name="AutoMR-6" /&gt; the very first of which was a rerelease of the [[Billy Joel]] album ''[[52nd Street (album)|52nd Street]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/the-first-compact-disc-released/|title=How Billy Joel's '52nd Street' Became the First Compact Disc released|first=Jeff|last=Giles|work=[[Ultimate Classic Rock]]|publisher=[[Townsquare Media|Townsquare Media, LLC]]|date=October 1, 2012|accessdate=October 13, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170706021629/http://ultimateclassicrock.com/the-first-compact-disc-released/|archivedate=6 July 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The first CD played on BBC Radio was in October 1982 on BBC Radio Scotland (Jimmy Mack programme, Followed by Ken Bruce and Eddie Mair all BBC Scotland), with the first CD ''played'' on UK independent radio station shortly after (Radio Forth, Jay Crawford Show). The CD was Dire Straits, ''Love over Gold''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hificorner.co.uk {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171004211808/http://www.hificorner.co.uk/ |date=4 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Japanese launch was followed in March 1983 by the introduction of CD players and discs to Europe&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newscenter.philips.com/main/standard/about/news/press/20070816_25th_anniversary_cd.wpd "Philips celebrates 25th anniversay of the Compact Disc"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302105238/http://www.newscenter.philips.com/main/standard/about/news/press/20070816_25th_anniversary_CD.wpd |date=2 March 2012 }}, Philips Media Release, 16 August 2007.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This 1983 event is often seen as the "Big Bang"{{By whom|date=October 2017}} of the digital audio revolution. The new audio disc was enthusiastically received, especially in the early-adopting [[European classical music|classical music]] and [[audiophile]] communities, and its handling quality received particular praise. As the price of players gradually came down, and with the introduction of the portable [[Discman]] the CD began to gain popularity in the larger popular and rock music markets. One of the first CD markets was devoted to reissuing popular music whose commercial potential was already proven. An advantage of the format was the ability to produce and market boxed sets and multi-volume collections.&lt;ref name="AndItsEnd" /&gt; The first artist to sell a million copies on CD was [[Dire Straits]], with their 1985 album ''[[Brothers in Arms (album)|Brothers in Arms]]''.&lt;ref name="AutoMR-7" /&gt; The first major artist to have their entire catalogue converted to CD was [[David Bowie]], whose first fourteen studio albums of (then) sixteen were made available by [[RCA Records]] in February 1985, along with four greatest hits albums; his fifteenth and sixteenth albums had already been issued on CD by [[EMI Records]] in 1983 and 1984, respectively.&lt;ref name="AutoMR-8" /&gt; On February 26, 1987, the first four UK albums by [[The Beatles]] were released in mono on compact disc.&lt;ref name="BeatlesCD" /&gt; In 1988, 400 million CDs were manufactured by 50 pressing plants around the world.&lt;ref name="AutoMR-9" /&gt;

=== Further development and decline ===
[[File:Sony CD Walkman D-E330 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Sony CD Walkman D-E330]]
The CD was planned to be the successor of the [[vinyl record]] for playing music, rather than primarily as a data storage medium. From its origins as a musical format, CDs have grown to encompass other applications. In 1983, following the CD's introduction, [[Kees Schouhamer Immink|Immink]] and [[Joseph Braat|Braat]] presented the first experiments with erasable compact discs during the 73rd [[Audio Engineering Society|AES]] Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In June 1985, the computer-readable [[CD-ROM]] (read-only memory) and, in 1990, [[CD-R]]ecordable were introduced, also developed by both Sony and Philips.&lt;ref name="AutoMR-10" /&gt; Recordable CDs were a new alternative to tape for recording music and copying music albums without defects introduced in compression used in other digital recording methods. Other newer video formats such as [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] use the same physical geometry as CD, and most DVD and Blu-ray players are [[backward compatible]] with audio CD.

By the early 2000s, the CD player had largely replaced the [[Compact Cassette|audio cassette]] player as standard equipment in new automobiles, with 2010 being the final model year for any car in the United States to have a factory-equipped cassette player.&lt;ref name="nyt20120718" /&gt;  With the increasing popularity of portable digital audio players, such as mobile phones, and solid state music storage, CD players are being phased out of automobiles in favor of [[minijack]] auxiliary inputs, wired connection to USB devices and wireless [[Bluetooth]] connection.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=As Digital Content Moves into Cars, CD Players Begin to Move Out. |work=Journal of Transportation |date=November 8, 2008 |url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-189276198.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161008194548/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-189276198.html |archivedate=8 October 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, with the advent and popularity of [[Digital distribution|Internet-based distribution]] of files in [[Lossy compression|lossily-compressed]] [[audio format]]s such as [[MP3]], sales of CDs began to decline in the 2000s. For example, between 2000 and 2008, despite overall growth in music sales and one anomalous year of increase, major-label CD sales declined overall by 20%,&lt;ref name="AutoMR-11" /&gt; although independent and DIY music sales may be tracking better according to figures released 30 March 2009, and CDs still continue to sell greatly.&lt;ref name="AutoMR-12" /&gt;  As of 2012, CDs and DVDs made up only 34 percent of music sales in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tokyotimes.com/buying-cds-continues-to-be-a-tradition-in-japan/|title=Buying CDs continues to be a tradition in Japan - Tokyo Times|date=23 August 2013|publisher=|access-date=30 December 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220150903/http://www.tokyotimes.com/buying-cds-continues-to-be-a-tradition-in-japan/|archivedate=20 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  {{As of|2015|alt=By 2015}}, only 24% of music in the United States was purchased on physical media, ⅔ of this consisting of CDs;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://riaa.com/media/238E8AC7-3810-A95C-44DC-B6DEB46A3C6E.pdf|title=News and Notes on 2015 Mid-Year RIAA Shipment and Revenue Statistics|last=Friedlander|first=Joshua P.|year=2015|website=|publisher=Recording Industry Association of America|format=PDF|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930135150/http://riaa.com/media/238E8AC7-3810-A95C-44DC-B6DEB46A3C6E.pdf|archive-date=30 September 2015|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, in the same year in Japan, over 80% of music was bought on CDs and other physical formats.&lt;ref&gt;Sisaro, Ben.

Despite the rapidly declining sales year-over-year, the pervasiveness of the technology remained for a time, with companies placing CDs in pharmacies, supermarkets, and filling station convenience stores targeting buyers least able to use Internet-based distribution.&lt;ref name="AndItsEnd" /&gt; However, in 2018, [[Best Buy]] and [[Target Corporation]] both announced plans to decrease their focus on CD sales.&lt;ref name="bestverge"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/6/16973538/bestbuy-target-cd-sales-vinyl-cassette|title=Best Buy will stop selling CDs as digital music revenue continues to grow|first=Thuy|last=Ong|date=February 6, 2018|accessdate=February 6, 2018|publisher=[[The Verge]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobbyowsinski/2018/07/07/best-buy-cd-sales/amp/|title=Best Buy, Winding Down CD Sales, Pounds Another Nail Into The Format's Coffin|first=Bobby|last=Owsinski|date=July 7, 2018|work=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2018/07/02/best-buy-ends-cd-sales/|title=End of a Era: Best Buy Significantly Cuts Back on CDs|author=Chris Morris|date=July 2, 2018|work=Fortune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Awards and accolades ===
Sony and Philips received praise for the development of the compact disc from professional organizations. These awards include
* Technical [[Grammy Award]] for Sony and Philips, 1998.&lt;ref name=grammy /&gt;
* [[IEEE]] Milestone award, 2009, for Philips only with the citation: "On 8 March 1979, N.V. Philips' Gloeilampenfabrieken demonstrated for the international press a Compact Disc Audio Player. The demonstration showed that it is possible by using digital optical recording and playback to reproduce audio signals with superb stereo quality. This research at Philips established the technical standard for digital optical recording systems."&lt;ref name="IEEE_CD_Milestone" /&gt;

A CD is made from {{convert|1.2|mm|in}} thick, [[polycarbonate]] plastic and weighs 15–20&amp;nbsp;grams.&lt;ref name="AutoMR-13" /&gt;{{better source|date=May 2016}} From the center outward, components are: the center spindle hole (15&amp;nbsp;mm), the first-transition area (clamping ring), the clamping area (stacking ring), the second-transition area (mirror band), the program (data) area, and the rim. The inner program area occupies a radius from 25 to 58&amp;nbsp;mm.

A thin layer of aluminium or, more rarely, [[Gold compact disc|gold]] is applied to the surface, making it reflective. The metal is protected by a film of lacquer normally [[spin coated]] directly on the reflective layer. The label is printed on the lacquer layer, usually by [[screen printing]] or [[offset printing]].

CD data is represented as tiny indentations known as "pits", encoded in a spiral track moulded into the top of the polycarbonate layer. The areas between pits are known as "lands". Each pit is approximately 100&amp;nbsp;[[Nanometre|nm]] deep by 500&amp;nbsp;nm wide, and varies from 850&amp;nbsp;nm to 3.5&amp;nbsp;[[Micrometre|µm]] in length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laesieworks.com/digicom/Storage_CD.html|title=Compact Disc|access-date=6 May 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160512100137/http://www.laesieworks.com/digicom/Storage_CD.html|archivedate=12 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distance between the tracks, the pitch, is 1.6&amp;nbsp;µm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.multimediadirector.com/help/technology/downloads/tech_docs/cdintroduction.pdf|title=Introduction to CD and CD-ROM|last=Sharpless|first=Graham|date=July 2003|publisher=Deluxe Global Media Services Ltd|access-date=3 May 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309135812/http://www.multimediadirector.com/help/technology/downloads/tech_docs/cdintroduction.pdf|archivedate=9 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IEC908"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/3885|title=IEC 60908 Audio recording - Compact disc digital audio system|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506194944/https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/3885|archivedate=6 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IEC10149"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/9362|title=ISO/IEC 10149 Information technology -- Data interchange on read-only 120 mm optical data disks (CD-ROM)|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506194949/https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/9362|archivedate=6 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A motor within the CD player spins the disc to a scanning velocity of 1.2–1.4&amp;nbsp;m/s ([[constant linear velocity]])&amp;nbsp;– equivalent to approximately 500 RPM at the inside of the disc, and approximately 200 RPM at the outside edge. (A disc played from beginning to end slows its rotation rate during playback.)

The program area is 86.05&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and the length of the recordable spiral is (86.05&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;1.6&amp;nbsp;µm)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;5.38&amp;nbsp;km. With a scanning speed of 1.2&amp;nbsp;m/s, the playing time is 74 minutes, or 650&amp;nbsp;MiB of data on a CD-ROM. A disc with data packed slightly more densely is tolerated by most players (though some old ones fail). Using a linear velocity of 1.2&amp;nbsp;m/s and a narrower track pitch of 1.5&amp;nbsp;µm increases the playing time to 80 minutes, and data capacity to 700&amp;nbsp;MiB.
[[File:CD Pits at 6.25x Magnification.jpg|alt=This is a photomicrograph of the pits at the inner edge of a CD-ROM; 2 second exposure under visible fluorescent light.|thumb|The pits in a CD are 500 [[nanometre|nm]] wide, between 830 nm and 3,000 nm long and 150 nm deep]]
A CD is read by focusing a 780&amp;nbsp;nm [[wavelength]] ([[near infrared]]) [[semiconductor laser]] housed within the CD player, through the bottom of the polycarbonate layer. The change in height between pits and lands results in a difference in the way the light is reflected. By measuring the intensity change with a [[photodiode]], the data can be read from the disc. In order to accommodate the spiral pattern of data, the [[semiconductor laser]] is placed on a mobile laser pickup assembly mechanism within the disc tray of any CD player; this mechanism typically takes the form of a hub that slides across a rail or [[worm gear]], though some CD drives (particularly those manufactured by Philips during the 1980s and early 1990s) use a swing arm similar to that seen on a gramophone. This mechanism allows the laser to read information from the centre to the edge of a disc without having to interrupt the spinning of the disc itself.

[[File:CDM210 cd laufwerk.jpg|thumb|Philips CDM210 CD Drive]]

The pits and lands do not directly represent the zeros and ones of [[binary data]]. Instead, [[non-return-to-zero, inverted]] encoding is used: a change from pit to land or land to pit indicates a one, while no change indicates a series of zeros. There must be at least two and no more than ten zeros between each one, which is defined by the length of the pit. This in turn is decoded by reversing the [[eight-to-fourteen modulation]] used in mastering the disc, and then reversing the [[cross-interleaved Reed–Solomon coding]], finally revealing the raw data stored on the disc. These encoding techniques (defined in the ''[[Compact Disc Digital Audio#Data encoding|Red Book]]'') were originally designed for [[Compact Disc Digital Audio|CD Digital Audio]], but they later became a standard for almost all CD formats (such as [[CD-ROM]]).

=== Integrity ===
CDs are susceptible to damage during handling and from environmental exposure. Pits are much closer to the label side of a disc, enabling defects and contaminants on the clear side to be out of focus during playback. Consequently, CDs are more likely to suffer damage on the label side of the disc. Scratches on the clear side can be repaired by refilling them with similar refractive plastic or by careful polishing.  The edges of CDs are sometimes incompletely sealed, allowing gases and liquids to enter the CD and corrode the metal reflective layer and/or interfere with the focus of the laser on the pits, a condition known as [[disc rot]].&lt;ref name="clir"&gt;Council on Library and Information Resources: [http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub121/sec5.html Conditions that Affect CDs and DVDs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160915012213/https://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub121/sec5.html |date=15 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fungus ''[[Geotrichum candidum]]'' has been found—under conditions of high heat and humidity—to consume the polycarbonate plastic and aluminium found in CDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/news/1998/010628/full/news010628-11.html|title=Fungus eats CD|year=2001|journal=Nature|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212044729/http://www.nature.com/news/1998/010628/full/news010628-11.html|archivedate=12 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1402533.stm|title=Fungus 'eats' CDs|date=June 2001|publisher=BBC|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212220948/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1402533.stm|archivedate=12 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The digital data on a CD begins at the center of the disc and proceeds toward the edge, which allows adaptation to the different size formats available. Standard CDs are available in two sizes. By far, the most common is {{convert|120|mm|in}} in diameter, with a 74- or 80-minute audio capacity and a 650 or 700&amp;nbsp;MiB (737,280,000-byte) data capacity. The official Philips history says this capacity was specified by Sony executive [[Norio Ohga]] so as to be able to contain the entirety of [[Beethoven's Ninth Symphony]] on one disc.&lt;ref name="Ohgaobituary" /&gt; This is a myth according to [[Kees Schouhamer Immink|Kees Immink]], as the code format had not yet been decided in December 1979. The adoption of [[Eight-to-fourteen modulation|EFM]] in June 1980 would have allowed a playing time of 97 minutes for 120&amp;nbsp;mm diameter or 74 minutes for a disc as small as 100&amp;nbsp;mm, but instead the information density was lowered by 30% to keep the playing time at 74 minutes.&lt;ref name="Imminknature"&gt;{{Cite journal

== Logical format ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}

=== Audio CD ===
{{Main|Compact Disc Digital Audio}}
The logical format of an audio CD (officially Compact Disc Digital Audio or CD-DA) is described in a document produced in 1980 by the format's joint creators, Sony and Philips. The document is known colloquially as the ''Red Book'' [[Compact Disc Digital Audio|CD-DA]] after the colour of its cover. The format is a two-channel 16-bit [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] encoding at a [[44.1 kHz|44.1&amp;nbsp;kHz]] [[sampling rate]] per channel. [[Four-channel Compact Disc Digital Audio|Four-channel sound]] was to be an allowable option within the ''Red Book'' format, but has never been implemented. [[Monaural]] audio has no existing standard on a ''Red Book'' CD; thus, mono source material is usually presented as two identical channels in a standard ''Red Book'' stereo track (i.e., [[mono sound#Mirrored mono|mirrored mono]]); an [[MP3 CD]], however, can have audio file formats with mono sound.

[[CD-Text]] is an extension of the ''Red Book'' specification for audio CD that allows for storage of additional text information (e.g., album name, song name, artist) on a standards-compliant audio CD. The information is stored either in the [[Lead-in (CD)|lead-in area]] of the CD, where there is roughly five kilobytes of space available, or in the [[Compact Disc subcode|subcode]] channels R to W on the disc, which can store about 31 megabytes.

[[Compact Disc + Graphics]] is a special audio compact disc that contains graphics data in addition to the audio data on the disc. The disc can be played on a regular audio CD player, but when played on a special CD+G player, it can output a graphics signal (typically, the CD+G player is hooked up to a television set or a computer monitor); these graphics are almost exclusively used to display lyrics on a television set for [[karaoke]] performers to sing along with. The CD+G format takes advantage of the channels R through W. These six bits store the graphics information.

[[CD + Extended Graphics]] (CD+EG, also known as CD+XG) is an improved variant of the [[#CD + Graphics|Compact Disc + Graphics]] (CD+G) format. Like CD+G, CD+EG uses basic CD-ROM features to display text and video information in addition to the music being played. This extra data is stored in [[Compact Disc subcode|subcode]] channels R-W. Very few, if any, CD+EG discs have been published.

Super Audio CD (SACD) is a high-resolution read-only [[optical disc|optical]] [[audio storage|audio disc]] format that was designed to provide [[high fidelity|higher fidelity]] digital audio reproduction than the ''Red Book''. Introduced in 1999, it was developed by Sony and Philips, the same companies that created the ''Red Book''. SACD was in a [[format war]] with [[DVD-Audio]], but neither has replaced audio CDs. The SACD standard is referred to the ''Scarlet Book'' standard.

Titles in the SACD format can be issued as hybrid discs; these discs contain the SACD audio stream as well as a standard audio CD layer which is playable in standard CD players, thus making them [[backward compatibility|backward compatible]].

=== CD-MIDI ===
CD-[[Musical Instrument Digital Interface|MIDI]] is a format used to store music-performance data, which upon playback is performed by electronic instruments that synthesize the audio. Hence, unlike the original ''Red Book'' CD-DA, these recordings are not digitally sampled audio recordings. The CD-MIDI format is defined as an extension of the original ''Red Book''.

=== CD-ROM ===
{{Main|CD-ROM}}
For the first few years of its existence, the CD was a medium used purely for audio. However, in 1988, the ''Yellow Book'' [[CD-ROM]] standard was established by Sony and Philips, which defined a non-volatile optical data [[computer data storage]] medium using the same physical format as audio compact discs, readable by a computer with a CD-ROM drive.

=== Video CD (VCD) ===
{{Main|Video CD}}
Video CD (VCD, View CD, and Compact Disc digital video) is a standard [[Digital data|digital]] format for storing video media on a CD. VCDs are playable in dedicated VCD players, most modern [[DVD-Video]] players, personal computers, and some video game consoles.

The VCD standard was created in 1993 by Sony, Philips, [[Panasonic Corporation|Matsushita]], and [[JVC]] and is referred to as the ''White Book'' standard.

Overall picture quality is intended to be comparable to [[VHS]] video. Poorly compressed VCD video can sometimes be lower quality than VHS video, but VCD exhibits block artifacts rather than analog noise and does not deteriorate further with each use.

352x240 (or [[Source Input Format|SIF]]) resolution was chosen because it is half the vertical and half the horizontal resolution of NTSC video. 352x288 is similarly one quarter PAL/SECAM resolution. This approximates the (overall) resolution of an analog VHS tape, which, although it has double the number of (vertical) scan lines, has a much lower horizontal resolution.

=== Super Video CD ===
{{Main|Super Video CD}}
Super Video CD (Super Video Compact Disc or SVCD) is a format used for storing video media on standard compact discs. SVCD was intended as a successor to VCD and an alternative to DVD-Video and falls somewhere between both in terms of technical capability and picture quality.

SVCD has two thirds the [[display resolution|resolution]] of DVD, and over 2.7 times the resolution of VCD. One CD-R disc can hold up to 60 minutes of standard quality SVCD-format video. While no specific limit on SVCD video length is mandated by the specification, one must lower the video bit rate, and therefore quality, to accommodate very long videos. It is usually difficult to fit much more than 100 minutes of video onto one SVCD without incurring significant quality loss, and many hardware players are unable to play video with an instantaneous bit rate lower than 300 to 600 [[kilobits]] per second.

=== Photo CD ===
{{Main|Photo CD}}
Photo CD is a system designed by [[Kodak]] for digitizing and storing photos on a CD. Launched in 1992, the discs were designed to hold nearly 100 high-quality images, scanned prints and slides using special proprietary encoding. Photo CDs are defined in the ''Beige Book'' and conform to the [[CD-ROM XA]] and CD-i Bridge specifications as well. They are intended to play on CD-i players, Photo CD players and any computer with suitable software (irrespective of [[operating system]]). The images can also be printed out on photographic paper with a special Kodak machine. This format is not to be confused with Kodak [[Picture CD]], which is a consumer product in CD-ROM format.

=== CD-i ===
{{Main|Philips CD-i}}
The Philips ''[[Green Book (CD standard)|Green Book]]'' specifies a standard for interactive multimedia compact discs designed for [[Philips CD-i|CD-i]] players (1993). CD-i discs can contain audio tracks which can be played on regular [[CD player]]s, but CD-i discs are not compatible with most [[CD-ROM]] drives and software. The [[CD-i Ready]] specification was later created to improve compatibility with audio CD players, and the [[CD-i Bridge]] specification was added to create CD-i compatible discs that can be accessed by regular CD-ROM drives.

=== CD-i Ready ===
{{Main|CD-i Ready}}
Philips defined a format similar to CD-i called [[CD-i Ready]], which puts CD-i software and data into the [[Pregap#Computer data in pregap|pregap]] of track 1. This format was supposed to be more compatible with older audio CD players.

=== Enhanced Music CD (CD+) ===
{{Main|Blue Book (CD standard)}}
Enhanced Music CD, also known as CD Extra or CD Plus, is a format which combines [[CD-DA|audio tracks]] and [[CD-ROM|data tracks]] on the same disc by putting audio tracks in a first [[Session (CD)|session]] and data in a second session. It was developed by Philips and Sony, and it is defined in the ''[[Blue Book (CD standard)|Blue Book]]''.

=== VinylDisc ===
{{Main|VinylDisc}}
VinylDisc is the hybrid of a standard audio CD and the [[Gramophone record|vinyl record]]. The vinyl layer on the disc's label side can hold approximately three minutes of music.

In 1995, material costs were 30 cents for the jewel case and 10 to 15 cents for the CD. Wholesale cost of CDs was $0.75 to $1.15, which retailed for $16.98.&lt;ref name="cd costs"&gt;{{cite news |author=Neil Strauss |date=5 July 1995 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/05/arts/pennies-that-add-up-to-16.98-why-cd-s-cost-so-much.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm |title=Pennies That Add Up to $16.98: Why CD's Cost So Much – New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |access-date=25 July 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130811000713/http://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/05/arts/pennies-that-add-up-to-16.98-why-cd-s-cost-so-much.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm |archivedate=11 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On average, the store received 35 percent of the retail price, the record company 27 percent, the artist 16 percent, the manufacturer 13 percent, and the distributor 9 percent.&lt;ref name="cd costs" /&gt; When 8-track tapes, cassette tapes, and CDs were introduced, each was marketed at a higher price than the format they succeeded, even though the cost to produce the media was reduced. This was done because the apparent value increased. This continued from vinyl to CDs but was broken when [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] marketed MP3s for $0.99, and albums for $9.99. The incremental cost, though, to produce an MP3 is very small.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Amy HarmonPublished: 12 October 2003 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/12/arts/music-what-price-music.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm |title=MUSIC; What Price Music? |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=12 October 2003 |access-date=25 July 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512175059/http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/12/arts/music-what-price-music.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm |archivedate=12 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Writable compact discs ==

=== Recordable CD ===
[[File:Maxell CD-R 700MB 40x 20040321.jpg|thumb|700&amp;nbsp;[[Mebibyte|MiB]] CD-R next to a [[mechanical pencil]]]]
{{Main|CD-R}}
Recordable Compact Discs, [[CD-R]]s, are injection-molded with a "blank" data spiral. A photosensitive dye is then applied, after which the discs are metalized and lacquer-coated. The write laser of the [[CD recorder]] changes the colour of the dye to allow the read laser of a standard [[CD player]] to see the data, just as it would with a standard stamped disc. The resulting discs can be read by most CD-ROM drives and played in most audio CD players. CD-Rs follow the ''Orange Book'' standard.

CD-R recordings are designed to be permanent. Over time, the dye's physical characteristics may change causing read errors and data loss until the reading device cannot recover with error correction methods. The design life is from 20 to 100 years, depending on the quality of the discs, the quality of the writing drive, and storage conditions. However, testing has demonstrated such degradation of some discs in as little as 18 months under normal storage conditions.&lt;ref name="AutoMR-14" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoMR-15" /&gt; This failure is known as [[disc rot]], for which there are several, mostly environmental, reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub121/sec5.html|title=5. Conditions That Affect CDs and DVDs — Council on Library and Information Resources|website=www.clir.org|access-date=2016-07-05|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160915012213/https://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub121/sec5.html|archivedate=15 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The recordable audio CD is designed to be used in a consumer audio CD recorder. These consumer audio CD recorders use SCMS ([[Serial Copy Management System]]), an early form of [[digital rights management]] (DRM), to conform to the AHRA ([[Audio Home Recording Act]]). The Recordable Audio CD is typically somewhat more expensive than CD-R due to lower production volume and a 3% [[Audio Home Recording Act#AHRA royalties|AHRA royalty]] used to compensate the music industry for the making of a copy.&lt;ref name="McFadden" /&gt;

High-capacity recordable CD is a higher-density recording format that can hold 90 or 99 minutes of audio on a {{convert|12|cm|0|abbr=on}} disc (compared to about 80 minutes for ''Red Book'' audio) or 30 minutes of audio on an {{convert|8|cm|0|abbr=on}} disc (compared to about 24 minutes for ''Red Book'' audio).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.osta.org/technology/cdqa7.htm |title=Understanding CD-R &amp; CD-RW |publisher=Osta.org |access-date=25 July 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801123221/http://www.osta.org/technology/cdqa7.htm |archivedate=1 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The higher capacity is incompatible with some recorders and recording software.&lt;ref name="cdrfaq"&gt;{{cite web

=== ReWritable CD ===
{{Main|CD-RW}}
[[CD-RW]] is a re-recordable medium that uses a metallic alloy instead of a dye. The write laser in this case is used to heat and alter the properties (amorphous vs. crystalline) of the alloy, and hence change its reflectivity. A CD-RW does not have as great a difference in reflectivity as a pressed CD or a CD-R, and so many earlier CD audio players ''cannot'' read CD-RW discs, although ''most'' later CD audio players and stand-alone [[DVD]] players can. CD-RWs follow the ''Orange Book'' standard.

The ReWritable Audio CD is designed to be used in a consumer audio CD recorder, which will not (without modification) accept standard CD-RW discs. These consumer audio CD recorders use the [[Serial Copy Management System]] (SCMS), an early form of [[digital rights management]] (DRM), to conform to the United States' [[Audio Home Recording Act]] (AHRA). The ReWritable Audio CD is typically somewhat more expensive than CD-RW due to (a) lower volume and (b) a 3% [[Audio Home Recording Act#AHRA royalties|AHRA royalty]] used to compensate the music industry for the making of a copy.&lt;ref name="McFadden" /&gt;

==== Speed ====
Due to technical limitations, the original ReWritable CD could be written no faster than 4x speed. High Speed ReWritable CD has a different design, which permits writing at speeds ranging from 4x to 12x. Original CD-RW drives can only write to original ReWritable CDs. High Speed CD-RW drives can typically write to both original ReWritable CDs and High Speed ReWritable CDs. Both types of CD-RW discs can be read in most CD drives. Higher speed CD-RW discs, Ultra Speed (16x to 24x write speed) and Ultra Speed+ (32x write speed) are now available.

== Copy protection ==
{{Main|Compact Disc and DVD copy protection}}
The ''Red Book'' audio specification, except for a simple "anti-copy" statement in the subcode, does not include any [[copy protection]] mechanism. Known at least as early as 2001,&lt;ref name="BadCDs" /&gt; attempts were made by record companies to market "copy-protected" non-standard compact discs, which cannot be ripped, or copied, to hard drives or easily converted to other formats (like [[FLAC]], [[MP3]] or [[Vorbis]]). One major drawback to these copy-protected discs is that most will not play on either computer CD-ROM drives or some standalone CD players that use CD-ROM mechanisms. Philips has stated that such discs are not permitted to bear the trademarked ''Compact Disc Digital Audio'' logo because they violate the ''Red Book'' specifications. Numerous copy-protection systems have been countered by readily available, often free, software, or even by simply turning off automatic [[AutoPlay]] to prevent the running of the DRM [[executable]] program.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5063">The '''Corporate Fraud Task Force''' was a [[United States Federal Government]]-wide [[task force]] formed by President [[George W. Bush]] in the wake of corporate [[accounting scandals]] that shook investor confidence. Task Force establishment occurred through [[delegated legislation]] with the issuance of [[s:Executive Order 13271|Executive Order 13271]] of July 9, 2002, ‘‘''Establishment of the Corporate Fraud Task Force''’’.

President Bush had remarked in the address announcing the creation of CFTF that...

:: ‘‘We will use the full weight of the law to expose and root out corruption,’’ Bush said on July 9, 2002.‘‘My administration will do everything in our power to end the days of cooking the books, shading the truth and breaking our laws.’’ &lt;ref&gt;[https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/07/print/20020709-4.html President Announces Tough New Enforcement Initiatives for Reform], George W. Bush, Press Release, 9 July 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[CNN]] at the time:

:: ‘‘Bush's speech was designed in part to refute critics who have called him too cozy with Corporate America -- particularly Democrats who, in a congressional election year, seem unlikely to cut him much slack, especially after raising questions about his own past business dealings.’’

:: ‘‘The speech, which the administration had been advertising for weeks in advance, came a day after the president held an impromptu news conference and was forced to defend his sale of stock in [[Harken Energy]] 12 years ago.’’

'''''Culpa in contrahendo''''' is a [[Latin]] expression meaning "fault in conclusion of a contract". It is an important concept in [[contract law]] for many civil law countries, which recognize a clear duty to negotiate with care, and not to lead a negotiating partner to act to his detriment before a firm contract is concluded. In [[German contract law]], §311 [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|BGB]] lists a number of steps by which an obligation to pay damages may be created.

By contrast, in [[English contract law]], and many other common law jurisdictions, there has been stulted judicial acceptance of this concept. The doctrine of [[estoppel]] has been mooted by academics as a good model, but judges have refused to let it be a sidestep of the doctrine of [[consideration]], saying estoppel must be a shield not a sword, and calling instead for Parliamentary intervention.&lt;ref&gt;The English and Scottish Law Commissions invited [[Harvey McGregor]] to draw up a "Contract Code" (being a codification and fusion of English and Scots contract law), but neither country has adopted his 1993 recommendations.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, in the case of land, [[proprietary estoppel]] effectively created obligations regardless of any pre-existing contract. In the [[United States]], however, courts have allowed [[promissory estoppel]] to function as a substitute for the consideration doctrine. This movement was stimulated by the acceptance of the concept in section 90 of the first ''[[Restatement of Contracts]]''.

==''Culpa in contrahendo'' under German law==
Rudolf von Jhering is credited with developing the ''culpa in contrahendo'' doctrine. Originally, according to the prevailing interpretation of the German Civil Code, there was no such legal doctrine. The courts saw a gap in the law and used the ''culpa in contrahendo'' doctrine to fill it.

Since the 2001 reform of the law of obligations, ''culpa in contrahendo'' is provided for by statute. (§311(2) in connection with §§280(1) and 241(2) of the German Civil Code).

Jhering argued that the "reliance measure" ought to be the proper one in "not quite" contracts, e.g. where there is a misunderstanding as to the terms of the contract.

'''Czech Police Museum''' – (in [[Czech language|Czech]] – Muzeum Policie České republiky - Museum of [[Police of the Czech Republic]]) is a [[museum]] located in the historical centre of [[Prague]] dedicated to the history of law enforcement on the territory of the [[Czech Republic]] and former [[Czechoslovakia]].
The museum is located on the grounds of the former Augustinian monastery, in the Karlov neighbourhood in the [[New Town, Prague|New Town of Prague]], which was founded in 1350 by [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]]. The monastery was previously the [[Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary and St Charles the Great]].
When monastery was abolished by Emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], it passed into the possession of the state, and served at first as a warehouse, later as hospital for the treatment of infectious diseases, almshouse and during [[World War I]] a centre for army convalescents. 
[[image:Albert_panorama.jpg|thumb| Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary and St Charles the Great in Karlov, Prague.]]

In the 1960s it was acquired by the Ministry of the Interior, which set it up as a state regional archive and later a museum. 
The current museum documents the history and activities of the state security corps, presenting their specialised departments including criminal investigation, from 1918 to the present. This museum documents and presents the history, development and operation of law enforcement forces in the former Czechoslovakia since its inception to the present. In addition to permanent exhibitions concerning [[forensic science]], criminal investigation, borders protection or history of petty crimes in Old Prague, the museum also has temporary exhibitions. The museum is open daily except Monday.

The '''citizenship law of the [[Czech Republic]]''' is based on the principles of [[jus sanguinis]] or "''right by blood''". In other words, descent from a Czech parent is the primary method of acquiring Czech citizenship (together with naturalisation). Birth on Czech territory without a Czech parent is in itself insufficient for the conferral of Czech citizenship. Every Czech citizen is also a [[Citizenship of the European Union|citizen]] of the [[European Union]]. The law came into effect on 1 January 1993, the date of the [[dissolution of Czechoslovakia]], and has been amended in 1993, 1995, 1996, 1999, 2002, 2003, and 2005. Since 1 January 2014, [[multiple citizenship]] under Czech law is allowed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mzv.cz/consulate.newyork/en/visa_and_consular_information/about_czech_citizenship_and_dual/new_citizenship_legislation_of_the_czech.html Consular information on dual citizenship, Consulate General of the Czech Republic, New York]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mzv.cz/toronto/en/news/new_citizenship_law.html Consular information on dual citizenship, Consulate General of the Czech Republic, Toronto]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Citizenship by birth==
[[Image:Czech passport 2007 cover.jpg|thumb|The cover of a [[Biometric passport|biometric]] [[Czech passport]]]]

The principle of jus sanguinis is used to determine eligibility for citizenship, as is typical in [[Europe]]. In principle, any person born to a Czech citizen is a Czech citizen at birth. Whether the person is born in the Czech Republic or elsewhere is irrelevant. Where only the father is Czech, and the parents are unmarried, proof of paternity is required - by the parents making a concerted declaration before the Registry Office or a court. Children born in the Czech Republic to non-Czech parents do not acquire Czech citizenship unless:

* the parents are [[Stateless person|stateless]]; and
* at least one parent is a [[permanent residency|permanent resident]] of the Czech Republic

Children aged less than 15 years found on the territory of the Czech Republic (where identity of the parents cannot be established) are deemed to be Czech citizens.

==Emigrants==
&lt;!-- Citation needed --&gt;During the communist era (1948–89) hundreds of thousands of Czechoslovakian citizens had emigrated into other parts of [[Western world|the West]]. The regime punished emigration by removing Czechoslovak citizenship, along with property confiscation and ''in absentia'' prison sentences. Since the [[Velvet Revolution]] in 1989, many emigrants demanded their citizenship be restored. Between 1999 and 2004, a special measure allowed them to regain the citizenship,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://krajane.radio.cz/cs/article_detail/223 |title=Navracení občanství Čechoameričanům - Krajane.net |language=cs |publisher=Krajane.radio.cz |date=2009-01-28 |accessdate=2012-06-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080211182353/http://krajane.radio.cz/cs/article_detail/223 |archivedate=11 February 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; but a few people took advantage of the wording, which "granted" citizenship rather than "restored" it and so got dual citizenship. A few people from [[Volhynia]] and [[Romania]] also got citizenship.

==Declaration==
If a person was a citizen of the [[Czech and Slovak Federative Republic]] as of 31 December 1992, he may declare citizenship of either the Czech Republic or [[Slovakia]] (gaining [[Slovak nationality law|Slovak citizenship]]) assuming he does not have any other citizenship. The Slovak provision allowing for this grant expired in 1993, however the Czech equivalent remains in the citizenship law.

==Naturalisation==
Resident foreigners or stateless persons who have for at least five years held a right of permanent residence and have resided in the Czech Republic for most of that time can apply for Czech naturalisation if they can prove they have lost or will lose their original citizenship upon being granted Czech citizenship (valid till December 31, 2013), are of good character and are proficient in the [[Czech language]] (current or former Slovak citizens are exempt from language requirements). Parents can apply for their children under 15 years of age, and naturalisation occurs at the discretion of the Interior Ministry.

The residence requirement can be waived if the person has a permanent residence permit and
*was born on the territory of the Czech Republic, or
*has lived there for at least 10 years continuously, or
*has held Czech citizenship before, or
*was adopted by a Czech citizen, or
*his or her spouse is a Czech citizen, or
*at least one of his or her parents is a Czech citizen, or
*has relocated to the Czech Republic before 31 December 1994 on the invitation of the Czech government, or
*is stateless or has refugee status in the Czech Republic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Granting Nationality of the Czech Republic |work=[[Ministry of the Interior of the Czech Republic]]|date=|url= http://www.mvcr.cz/mvcren/article/granting-nationality-of-the-czech-republic.aspx|accessdate=2012-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Loss of citizenship==
[[Image:Czech passport 2006 MRZ data.jpg|thumb|The information page of a Czech passport]]

===Involuntary===
The involuntary loss of citizenship is constitutionally prohibited. However, before the 2013 Citizenship Act (effective as of January 1, 2014) it was sometimes argued by emigrants and emigrant groups that the restrictions on dual citizenship were a form of involuntary deprivation of citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groups.google.com.au/group/soc.culture.czecho-slovak/browse_thread/thread/408b34e6208218b4/ef7d113f464d15db?lnk=st&amp;q=czech+dual+citizenship#ef7d113f464d15db |title=Dual Citizenship Duel - soc.culture.czecho-slovak &amp;#124; Google Groups |publisher=Groups.google.com.au |date= |accessdate=2012-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voluntary (restrictions on dual citizenship)===
Czech citizenship can be renounced voluntarily if doing so wouldn't cause one to be stateless unless it is in connection with a marriage or by birth &amp;ndash; the Czech Republic does not require children born with another nationality to renounce it upon reaching maturity.

==Waiving the requirements==
The Czech [[Ministry of Interior]] can waive all citizenship requirements if the person cannot be released from the original citizenship, if the other state refuses to issue confirmation of the loss of citizenship, if the loss of foreign citizenship would result in persecution, if it is in the political interests of the Czech Republic, or if the applicant has resided on the territory of what is today the Czech Republic for at least twenty years.

==Proof of citizenship==
Czech citizenship can be proved by presenting a national identification card (''[[občanský průkaz]]''), a travel document (such as a [[Czech passport]]), a proof of citizenship document, or a marriage certificate (if citizenship details are included).

==Dual citizenship==
Czech Republic allows its citizens to hold foreign citizenship in addition to their Czech citizenship. Some countries, however, do not permit multiple citizenship e.g. adults who acquired Czech and [[Japanese citizenship]] by birth must declare, to the latter's [[Ministry of Justice (Japan)|Ministry of Justice]], before turning 22, which citizenship they want to keep.

==Citizenship of the European Union==
Because Czech Republic forms part of the [[European Union]], Czech citizens are also [[citizenship of the European Union|citizens of the European Union]] under [[European Union law]] and thus enjoy [[Freedom of movement for workers#Transitional provisions in new member states|rights of free movement]] and [[Czech Republic (European Parliament constituency)|have the right to vote]] in [[Elections in the European Union|elections]] for the [[European Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://europa.eu/about-eu/countries/member-countries/czechrepublic/index_en.htm | title=Czech Republic | publisher=European Union | accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When in a non-EU country where there is no Czech embassy, Czech citizens have the right to get consular protection from the embassy of any other EU country present in that country.&lt;ref&gt;Article 20(2)(c) of the [[s:Consolidated version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union/Part Two: Non-Discrimination and Citizenship of the Union#Article 20|Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Citizenship_of_the_European_Union#Stated_rights|Rights abroad: Right to consular protection]]: a right to protection by the diplomatic or consular authorities of other Member States when in a non-EU Member State, if there are no diplomatic or consular authorities from the citizen's own state (Article 23): this is due to the fact that not all member states maintain embassies in every country in the world (14 countries have only one embassy from an EU state). [[Antigua and Barbuda]] (UK), [[Barbados]] (UK), [[Belize]] (UK), [[Central African Republic]] (France), [[Comoros]] (France), [[Gambia]] (UK), [[Guyana]] (UK), [[Liberia]] (Germany), [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]] (UK), [[San Marino]] (Italy), [[São Tomé and Príncipe]] (Portugal), [[Solomon Islands]] (UK), [[Timor-Leste]] (Portugal), [[Vanuatu]] (France)&lt;/ref&gt; Czech citizens can live and work in any country within the EU as a result of the right of free movement and residence granted in [[Treaties of the European Union|Article 21 of the EU Treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2008:115:0047:0199:EN:PDF |format=PDF|title=Treaty on the Function of the European Union  (consolidated version)|publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu|accessdate=2015-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Travel freedom of Czech citizens==
{{Main|Visa requirements for Czech citizens}}
[[File:Visa requirements for Czech citizens.png|450px|thumbnail|[[Visa requirements for Czech citizens]]{{legend|#FDC421|Czech Republic}}{{legend|#042E9B|Freedom of movement}}{{legend|#22B14C|Visa not required}}{{legend|#B5E61D|Visa on arrival}}{{legend|#61c09a|eVisa}}{{legend|#79D343|Visa available both on arrival or online}}{{legend|#A8ACAB|Visa required prior to arrival}}]]
Visa requirements for Czech citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of [[Czech Republic]]. As of May 2018, Czech citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 182 countries and territories, ranking the [[Czech passport]] 7th in terms of travel freedom (tied with Maltese and New Zealand passports) according to the [[Travel visa#Visa restrictions|Henley Passport Index]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Ranking - Passport Index 2018|url=https://www.henleyglobal.com/files/download/HPI2018/PI%202018%20INFOGRAPHS%20GLOBAL%20180518.pdf|publisher=Henley &amp; Partners|accessdate=22 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, The Czech nationality is ranked fifteenth in [[The Quality of Nationality Index|Nationality Index]] (QNI). This index differs from the [[Henley Passport Index|Visa Restrictions Index]], which focuses on external factors including travel freedom. The QNI considers, in addition, to travel freedom on internal factors such as peace &amp; stability, economic strength, and human development as well. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.businessinsider.de/nationalities-with-the-best-quality-of-life-2016-6?r=UK&amp;IR=T |title= The 41 nationalities with the best quality of life |date= 2016-02-06 |website=  www.businessinsider.de |access-date= 2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Electricity deregulation in Texas''', approved by [[Texas Senate]] Bill 7 on January 1, 2002, calls for the creation of the Electric Utility Restructuring Legislative Oversight Committee to oversee implementation of the bill. According to the law, [[deregulation]] would be phased in over several years.

As a result, 85%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Explore Energy Rates in Texas|url=http://www.saveonenergy.com/Texas/|work=SaveOnEnergy.com|accessdate=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  of Texas power consumers (those served by a company not owned by a municipality or a [[utility cooperative]]) can choose their electricity service from a variety of [[retail electric providers]] (REPs), including the incumbent utility.  The incumbent utility in the area still owns and maintains the local power lines (and is the company to call in the event of a power outage) and is not subject to deregulation.  Customers served by cooperatives or municipal utilities can choose an alternate REP only if the utility has "opted in" to deregulation; to date, only the area served by the [[Nueces Electric Cooperative]] has chosen to opt in.

Since 2002, approximately 85% of commercial and industrial consumers have switched power providers at least once. Approximately 40% of residential consumers in deregulated areas have switched from the former incumbent provider to a competitive REP. REPs providing service in the state include: AmeriPower, TriEagle Energy, Acacia Energy, [[Ambit Energy]], Breeze Energy, Clearview Energy, [[Green Mountain Energy]], Conservice Energy,  Iluminar Energy, Now Power, Snap Energy, Entrust Energy, Bounce Energy, [[Champion Energy]], Shnye Energy, Cirro Energy, [[Direct Energy]], [[Dynowatt]], [[First Texas Energy Corporation]], [[Frontier Utilities]], [[Gexa Energy]], [[Glacial Energy]], [[Just Energy]], Kinetic Energy, Mega Energy, APG&amp;E, [[Adjacent Energy]], Spark Energy, [[StarTex Power]], [[Stream Energy]], [[Tech Electricity]], [[Texas Power]],  [[TXU Energy]], [[XOOM Energy]] and 4Change Energy.

According to a 2014 report&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Dyer | first = R. A. | title = Deregulated Electricity in Texas | publisher = Texas Coalition for Affordable Power | year = 2014 | url = http://tcaptx.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/TCP-793-Deregulation2014-A-1.7.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the Texas Coalition for Affordable Power (TCAP), "deregulation cost Texans about $22 billion from 2002 to 2012. And residents in the deregulated market pay prices that are considerably higher than those who live in parts of the state that are still regulated. For example, TCAP found that the average consumer living in one of the areas that opted out of deregulation, such as Austin and San Antonio, paid $288 less in 2012 than consumers in the deregulated areas."

However, the report concluded that re-regulating the market would not solve the issue. TCAP instead offered a series of reforms designed to increase market efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title = The Generation Gap | last = Steffy | first = Loren | publisher = Texas Monthly |date=March 2014 | url = http://www.texasmonthly.com/story/was-deregulation-of-texas-electricity-markets-a-mistake?fullpage=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
{{Expand section|date=August 2014}}
Texas has electricity consumption of $24 billion a year, the highest among the U.S. states. Its annual consumption is comparable to that of [[Great Britain]] and [[Spain]], and if the state were an independent nation, its electricity market would be the 11th largest in the world.  Texas produces the most wind electricity in the U.S., but also has the highest Carbon Dioxide Emissions of any state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2013 State Energy Facts - Texas|url=http://www.saveonenergy.com/pdf/tx-energy-state-facts.pdf|work=SaveOnEnergy.com|accessdate=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2012, [[Texas]] residential electricity rates ranked 31st in the [[United States]] and average monthly residential electric bills in [[Texas]] were the 5th highest in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;

== System ==
{{Expand section|date=August 2014}}
The law designated the [[Electric Reliability Council of Texas|Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT)]] to be the authority to oversee grid reliability and operations so as to ensure no particular buyer or seller would gain an unfair advantage in the market.

=== The "price to beat" ===
Included within SB7 was the notion of the "price to beat" or PTB, an idea of a regulated rate governing the pricing behavior of the former utilities.

According to a typical economic theory, prices are optimally determined in a fair and transparent market, and not by a political or academic body. In deregulation of electricity markets, one immediate concern with pricing is that incumbent electricity providers would undercut the prices of new entrants, preventing competition and perpetuating the existing monopoly of providers. Thus, the SB7 bill introduced a phase-in period during which a price ''floor'' would be established (for incumbent electricity companies) to prevent this predatory practice, allowing new market entrants to become established. New market entrants could charge a price below the price to beat, but incumbents could not. This period was to last from 2002 to January 1, 2007. As of 2007 Texas investor owned utility affiliates no longer have price to beat tariffs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.puc.texas.gov/industry/electric/rates/PTB.aspx Expired Price to Beat Tariffs for Affiliated Retail Electric Providers], Public Utility Commission of Texas, Retrieved 21 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

'''How is the price to beat established?'''

In order to prompt entry into the market, the price to beat would have to be ''high enough'' to allow for a modest profit by new entrants. Thus, it had to be above the cost of inputs such as natural gas and coal. For example, a price to beat fixed at the actual wholesale procurement price of electricity does not give potential entrants a margin to compete against incumbent utilities.  Second, the price to beat would have to be ''reasonably low,'' to enable as many customers as possible to continue to consume electricity during the transition period.

== Results ==

===Electricity prices===
One desired effect of the competition is lower electricity rates. In the first few years after the deregulation in 2002, the residential rate for electricity increased seven times, with the price to beat at around 15 cents per kilowatt hour (as of July 26, 2006, www.powertochoose.org) in 2006.  However, while prices to customers increased 43% from 2002 to 2004, the costs of inputs rose faster, by 63%, showing that not all increases have been borne by consumers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050527075931/http://www.knowledgeproblem.com/archives/001269.html]&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[#Competition and entry of new firms|Competition and entry of new firms]] above for discussion on the relationship between retail prices, inputs, and investment.)

Compared to the rest of the nation, data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration which publishes annual state electric prices &lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title = Monthly Electric Utility Sales and Revenue Report with State Distributions (Form EIA-826) | publisher = U.S. Energy Information Administration |date=February 2016 | url = http://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia826/xls/sales_revenue.xls}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows that Texas' electric prices did rise above the national average immediately after deregulation from 2003 to 2009, but, from 2010 to 2015 have moved significantly below the national average price per kWh, with a total cost of $0.0863 per kWh in Texas in 2015 vs. $0.1042 nationally, or 17 percent lower in Texas. Between 2002-2014 the total cost to Texas consumers is estimated to be $24B, an average of $5,100 per household,  more than comparable markets under state regulation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/energy/article/Texas-consumers-pay-more-in-deregulated-7972017.php&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Texas consumers pay more in deregulated electricity markets, study says But affordable deals for electricity are starting to increase, official for nonprofit coalition says, Jordan BlumJune 8, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Competition===
The price to beat seemed to accomplish its goal of attracting competitors to the market during the period through January 1, 2007. It allowed competitors to enter the market without allowing the incumbents to undercut them in price. It has also given energy consumers the ability to compare energy rates offered by different providers. The less-regulated providers undercut the price to beat by only a small margin given that they must balance lower prices (to attract customers and build market share) with higher prices (needed to reinvest in new power plants). Due to the small difference in competing prices and slow (yearly or so) "buying" process, price decrease due to competition was very slow, and it took a few years to offset the original increase by "traditional" electric providers and move to lower rates.

One of the benchmarks of a successful free market is the range of choice provided to customers.  Choice can be viewed both in terms of the number of firms active in the market as well as the variety of products those firms offer to consumers.  In the first decade of retail electric deregulation in Texas, the market experienced dramatic changes in both metrics.  In 2002, residential customers in the Dallas-Fort area could choose between 10 retail electric providers offers a total of 11 price plans.  By the end of 2012, there were 45 retail electric providers offering 258 different price plans to residential customers in that market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scope of Competition in Electric Markets in Texas|url=http://www.puc.texas.gov/industry/electric/reports/scope/2015/2015scope_elec.pdf|work=Public Utility Commission of Texas|accessdate=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar increases in the number of retail electric providers and available plans have been realized in other deregulated electricity market areas with the state.

===Environmental Impact===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
In environmental impact, results are mixed. With the ability to invest profits to satisfy further energy demand, producers like TXU are proposing eleven new coal-fired powerplants. Coal powerplants are cheaper than natural gas-fired powerplants, but produce more pollution.  When the private equity firms [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts]] and the [[Texas Pacific Group]] announced the take-over of [[TXU Energy|TXU]], the company which was known for charging the highest rates in the state and were losing customers, they called off plans for eight of the coal plants.  TXU had invested more heavily in the other three.  A few weeks later the buyers announced plans for two cleaner IGCC coal plants.

There are positive environmental impacts from retail price deregulation as well. The profitable and growing Texas electricity market has drawn considerable investment by wind-turbine companies. In July 2006, Texas surpassed California in wind energy production.

Another positive environmental impact is the effect of higher energy prices on consumer choices, similar to the US market trend toward more fuel-efficient cars. As electric bills have risen, residents are reducing their electrical usage by using more moderate thermostat settings, installing insulation, installing solar screens, and other such activities. Texas utilities (such as Austin Energy) are also installing advanced electricity meters that may one day enable variable pricing based on the time of day. This would permit energy customers to save money by further tailoring their consumption based on whether it occurred during the peak demand period (high cost/high pollution) or the off-peak (night time).

== Effect on Renewable Energy ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
Due to the increased usage of natural gas immediately after deregulation, new-era energy tools such as wind power and smart-grid technology were greatly aided.  Texas' first "renewable portfolio standard" — or requirement that the state's utilities get a certain amount of their power from renewable energy like wind — was signed into law in 1999, as part of the same legislation that deregulated the electric market.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5467">A '''drain commissioner''' is an [[elected official]] in [[County (United States)|county government]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Michigan]] who is responsible for planning, developing and maintaining surface water [[drainage]] systems under Public Act 40 of 1956 [http://legislature.mi.gov/doc.aspx?mcl-act-40-of-1956]. In counties with a population under 12,000, the office of drain commissioner may be abolished with its [[statutory]] duties and responsibilities performed by the [[Administrative divisions of Michigan|county's board of road commissioners]]. Unlike other county-wide officeholders, drain commissioners were created by statute and are not mandated by the [[Michigan Constitution]]. Drain commissioners are elected on the [[Partisan (political)|partisan]] ballot in [[United States presidential election|presidential election years]] for a term of four years.

==History and reform==
The office of drain commissioner dates to Michigan's [[U.S. state|statehood]] in 1837, as much of the state's land was [[swamps]] and [[wetlands]]. An early bill passed by the [[Michigan Legislature]] was a drainage act, which led to the creation of drain commissioners at the [[township]] level. In 1897, township drain commissioners were abolished and the position was transferred to county government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casscountymi.org/Home/DrainCommissioner/HistoryofStormDrainage.aspx Cass County: History of Storm Drainage] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130123419/http://www.casscountymi.org/Home/DrainCommissioner/HistoryofStormDrainage.aspx |date=January 30, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.co.muskegon.mi.us/drain/ Muskegon County Drain Commissioner: What do Drain Commissioners do?]&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, proposals have been made to reform and even abolish the office. Successful efforts have changed the law to allow individual counties to rename the office to public works commissioner or water resources commissioner. &lt;ref&gt;[http://legislature.mi.gov/doc.aspx?mcl-280-21 MCL 280.21: County drain commissioner; election; term; temporary replacement; vacancy; bond; abolishment of office in certain counties; transfer of power and duties; effect of establishing department of public works or public improvement agency; election of public works commissioner; public hearing; abolishing office of public works commissioner; referring to office as drain commissioner; county governed by MCL 280.21a; change of name to office of water resources commissioner; criteria.]&lt;/ref&gt;

An unsuccessful reform proposal in 2009 was led by the then-drain commissioner of [[Cheboygan County]], Dennis Lennox, who sought to abolish the office in counties with a population of less than 35,000. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Drain commissioner wants to pull plug on his job|url=http://capitalnewsservice.wordpress.com/2009/11/06/drain-commissioner-wants-to-pull-plug-on-his-job|work=Capital News Service|date=6 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proposal was introduced in both houses of the Legislature after being approved by the Cheboygan County [[Board of Commissioners]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://legislature.mi.gov/doc.aspx?2009-HB-5216 HB 5216 (2009): Drains; drain commissioners; county drain commissioner; allow elimination or reestablishment of office.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://legislature.mi.gov/doc.aspx?2009-SB-0758 SB 758 (2009): Drains; drain commissioners; county drain commissioner; allow elimination or reestablishment of office.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the [[Schoolcraft County]] Board of Commissioners abolished the office of drain commissioner and transferred its duties and responsibilities to the county's road commissioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Drain Commission eliminated|url=http://www.pioneertribune.com/news/2012-03-22/Front_Page/Drain_Commission_eliminated.html|work=Pioneer Tribune|date=22 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Duties and responsibilities==
It is the only elected office in Michigan that can directly levy taxes and borrow money without a vote of the people. This led one drain commissioner to declare he is more powerful than the governor. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tisch: 'Drain Commissioner State's Most Powerful Man'|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1988&amp;dat=19790517&amp;id=1T4iAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=nqwFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5625,1930667|work=The Argus-Press|date=17 May 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the powers of the drain commissioner are immense, the office has become a [[sinecure]] in some counties, meaning it requires little to no responsibility. 

Nevertheless, drain commissioners are responsible for overseeing the county's drains. In Michigan, a '''drain''' may be a natural or artificial creek or ditch, or a massive pipe for carrying storm water. The territory served by a particular drain, its [[drainage basin|watershed]], is typically organized as a '''drainage district''' and the drain commissioner levies tax assessments and directs construction or maintenance of drains and culverts on behalf of each district. Drainage districts are public corporations, with legal rights similar to other political subdivisions of state government. Counties typically have dozens even hundreds of drainage districts.

In the [[law of the Soviet Union|legal system of the Soviet Union]], '''economic law''' was the legal theory and system under which economic relations were a legal discipline independent of [[criminal law]] and [[civil law (common law)|civil law]].&lt;ref name=encyc&gt;Ferdinand Joseph Maria Feldbrugge, Gerard Pieter van den Berg, William B. Simons (1985) "Encyclopedia of Soviet Law",  ''[[Brill Publishers|BRILL]]'', {{ISBN|90-247-3075-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ij&gt;O. S. (Olimpiad Solomonovich) Ioffe, Mark W. Janis (1987) "Soviet Law and Economy",  Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, {{ISBN|90-247-3265-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Law of the United States]] and some other legal systems this approximately corresponds to the [[commercial law]] ([[business law]]).

==Economic law==
In the Soviet legal system, the purpose of the economic law is to regulate the relations arising from the economic activities. The theory of the independence of the economic law was pursued after the [[21st Congress of the CPSU]] of 1959, with the principal proponent being [[V.V. Laptev]]. After debate, this position was codified by the decrees of the [[CPSU]] and the [[USSR Council of Ministers]] during 1970–1975 and finalized in the [[1977 Soviet Constitution]].&lt;ref name=encyc/&gt;

A '''facilitating payment''' is a certain type of payment to foreign officials that is not considered to be [[bribery]] according to [[legislation]]s of some states as well as in the international anti-bribery conventions, e.g., coming from the [[OECD]].

==Dangers==
For legal purposes, it is distinguished from [[bribery]], however the distinction is often blurred.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iol.co.za/business/opinion/is-facilitating-payment-a-bribe-or-not-758043 "Is 'facilitating payment' a bribe or not?"], ''Business Report'', September 8, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Determining whether a payment is a facilitating one may be difficult and depend on the circumstances. The value of the payment is not immediately relevant, however the greater the value, the higher are chances that it will be a [[red flag (signal)|red flag]] for law enforcement. Small unofficial payments are customary and even legal in some countries, nevertheless they may present a risk of liability according to the laws of the host country. There also exists a [[slippery slope]] danger of evolving into dubious payments.&lt;ref name=deming/&gt;

==Business ethics==
While being legal, facilitating payments are still considered to be questionable from the point of view of [[business ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Argandoña|first1=Antonio|title=Corruption and Companies: The Use of Facilitating Payments|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|date=September 2005|volume=60|issue=3|pages=251–264|doi=10.1007/s10551-005-0133-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bailes, Robert (2006). Facilitation Payments: Culturally Acceptable or Unacceptable Corrupt? ''[[Business Ethics: A European Review]]'', 15(3), 293-298.&lt;/ref&gt; The following arguments have been made:
*[[Unfair competition]]: smaller business have fewer opportunities and less financial possibilities to "grease" foreign officials.
*sustaining questionable business practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rdoger|first1=Raliigh|title=Ways to improve international business payment solutions|url=http://www.transferguru.com/blog/9-ways-improve-your-international-business-payment-solutions/|website=www.transferguru.com|accessdate=3 March 2017|language=en|date=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*dependence on irregular payments creates additional risk and hence discourages investment&lt;ref name=walters/&gt;

Many companies therefore restrict or severely limit making facilitating payments in their policies, however this practice is not yet widespread. For example, {{As of|2006|lc=on}}, in [[Australia]], among the [[S&amp;P ASX 100]] only 24 companies control facilitating payments and only 15 are reported to prohibit them.&lt;ref name=walters&gt;[http://www.allbusiness.com/management-companies-enterprises/1188858-1.html "Just how is business done? A review of Australian business's approach to bribery and corruption"], by Julie Walters, ''Keeping Good Companies'',  July 1, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development==
[[OECD]] defines a payment to be a facilitating one if it is paid to government employees to speed up an administrative process where the outcome is already pre-determined.&lt;ref name=walters/&gt;

==By country==
===Australia===
{{As of|2006}}, the [[Australia]]n law has discrepancies as to the definition of the facilitating payment.

The Criminal Code defines a facilitating payment to be a payment which is &lt;ref name=walters/&gt;
* of a nominal value (the term is not defined in the Code)
* paid to a foreign official for the sole or predominant purpose of expediting a minor routine action, and
* documented as soon as possible.

The  [[Income Tax Assessment Act]] as amended in 1999 permit companies claim facilitation payments as deductions (before 1999 bribes were also valid deductions), but its definition does not refer to the size of the payment.&lt;ref name=walters/&gt;

Many Australian states override the federal legislation and define facilitating payments as illegal.&lt;ref name=walters/&gt;

===Russia===
In Russia this phrase (in English) means payment to a bureaucrat when he does off-job extra work for a private entity by helping deal with his ministry. It is generally unclear whether it has a part of corruption in it. It was generally considered legal, until economy minister [[Ulyukaev]] received 8 years jail for it. After this case, Russian bureaucrats are reported to heavily refrain from this practice.

===United Kingdom===
{{As of|2010}}, subsequent to the Bribery Act, the [[United Kingdom]] does not recognize the legality of facilitating payments and does not draw any distinction from bribes. However the OECD notes that the UK is unlikely to prosecute for minor facilitating payments in the areas where it is a common practice. The Ministry of Justice guidance, however, confirms that prosecutors will exercise discretion in determining whether to prosecute. In addition, informal guidance received from the SFO indicate that where it is considering action, it will be guided by the following six principles:
* Whether the company has a clear and issued policy.
* Whether the company has written guidance available to employees as to the procedures they must follow where a facilitation payment is requested or expected.
* Whether such procedures are really being followed (monitoring).
* Evidence that gifts are being recorded at the company.
* Proper action, collective or otherwise, to inform the appropriate authorities in countries when a breach of the policy occurs.
* The company is taking what practical steps it can to curtail such payments.&lt;ref name=walters/&gt;

===United States===
Within the [[United States federal legislation]], a '''facilitating payment''' or '''"grease payment"''', as defined by the [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]] (FCPA) of 1977 and clarified in its 1988 amendments, is a payment to a foreign official, political party or party official for "routine governmental action", such as processing papers, issuing permits, and other actions of an official, in order to expedite performance of duties of non-discretionary nature, i.e., which they are already bound to perform. The payment is not intended to influence the outcome of the official's action, only its timing.&lt;ref name=deming&gt;Stuart H. Deming (2005)  The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act And the New International Norms",   American Bar Association, {{ISBN|1-59031-326-7}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=ITG208fCRvcC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;dq=%22facilitating+payment%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=aAgWUfUiD4&amp;sig=2zCEc0NNJwgL-GSgPosF0xCxJTU p.15]&lt;/ref&gt; Facilitation payments are one of the few exceptions from anti-[[bribery]] prohibitions of the law.

==Evolution of the notion==
Prior to the 1988 amendments, the exclusion of "grease payments" was via the definition of the "foreign official", which did not include persons without discretionary (decision-making) duties, e.g., ones with clerical functions. The major drawback of this approach is that often it is difficult to properly identify the scope of duties of a foreign official. The 1988 amendment eliminated this drawback by placing the emphasis on the purpose of the payment rather than on the duties of the recipient. At the same time the scope of the "routine governmental actions" in question was made sufficiently narrow and supplied with detailed examples.&lt;ref&gt;Don Zarin (1995) "Doing Business Under The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act",  Practising Law Institute {{ISBN|0-87224-087-8}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=bv8jACUiP74C&amp;pg=PT4&amp;vq=facilitating&amp;dq=%22facilitating+payment%22&amp;sig=WLtZd_725SOmPExCTH8MP-fRvMs#PPT114,M1  $5.1]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frank Van Dun''' (born February 22, 1947, [[Antwerp]]) is a [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[law]] [[philosopher]] and [[libertarianism|libertarian]] [[natural law]] theorist. He is associated with the law faculty of the [[University of Ghent]].

==Work==
Van Dun published his book ''Het Fundamenteel Rechtsbeginsel'' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]] for ''The Fundamental Principle of Law'') in 1983, in which he argued that a rationally convincing answer to the question "what is law?" can only be found by respecting dialogue and argumentation. He thus adheres to [[argumentation ethics]] justification of private law society or [[anarcho-capitalism]]. Based on this premise, Van Dun argues that every natural person (individual) has a lawful claim on his life, freedom and property. This claim is absolute, insofar it does not prohibit the equivalent claims of other natural persons, i.e. insofar as argumentation is respected.

Van Dun clearly distinguishes the ''lawful'' (ius) and the ''legal'' (lex). In his view, Western positive law systems reduce people to human resources, artificial persons with merely legal status. Positive law defines the ''legal'' but can only be ''lawful'' insofar as individuals have full secession rights from the institutional framework that is making said positive law. It logically follows that no judge can be forced upon a person who is willing to search a lawful solution for any conflict.

Van Dun claims that the correct interpretation of the [[non-aggression principle]] (NAP) is [[praxeology|praxeological]] rather than physical, because property is a "means of action". He thus claims ''freedom before property'' instead of ''freedom as property''. This implies that it's not necessarily only the last action in the chain of social causations that is unlawful. Consider the following examples:
* With regard to land encirclement, a praxeological NAP could imply a "freedom proviso" when the encircling land owner refuses to discuss a reasonable solution.
* With regard to copyrights, a praxeological NAP implies that the use of one's signature (as an expression of one's body as "means of action") could reasonably be considered more important than the physical freedom of exactly copying another person's signature with one's paper and ink.
* With regard to freedom of speech, a praxeological NAP could imply that it is unlawful for an individual to order an unlawful act, e.g. a general ordering a murder of someone willing to seek lawful solutions.

The ''freedom before property'' interpretation of the NAP is not widely accepted within the libertarian community. For example, [[Walter Block]] adheres to the ''freedom as property'' interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Block, Walter (2004). ''Reply to Frank Van Dun's Natural Law and the Jurisprudence of Freedom''. Journal of Libertarian Studies. [http://mises.org/journals/jls/18_2/18_2_4.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human rights===
Van Dun sees human rights as fundamentally different from the "Universal Declaration of Human Rights". According to him when you have a right you have a right. Therefore, human rights are, e.g., the right of self-determination for one's own life, liberty and the products of one's liberty (property) and call these rights fundamental rights. This is not the case in the "Universal Declaration of Human Rights". He sees the "Universal Declaration of Human Rights" equivalent to "Animal Rights", since the rights enumerated in the "Universal Declaration of Human Rights" are sometimes conflicting with each other and many of these rights are only valid insofar as legislation of the government is not contradicting it. Therefore, he sees rulers which are acting as masters of the "human" animals (i.e. "slaves") in the "Universal Declaration of Human Rights".&lt;ref&gt;http://mises.org/journals/jls/15_4/15_4_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tobacco lobby==
The Belgian newspaper ''[[Le Soir]]'' reported on 8 June 2012, that between 1988 and 2000, Belgian scientists Van Dun and Marcel Javeau were paid by the tobacco lobby, through the group 'Associates for Research in the Science of Enjoyment' (ARISE).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lesoir.be/actualite/belgique/2010-06-08/le-lobby-du-tabac-recrutait-des-profs-d-unif-774824.php Le lobby du tabac recrutait des prof d'unif] Le soir, 8 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Van Dun responded in the Belgian ''Eos-magazine''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eosmagazine.eu/home/ctl/Detail/mid/485/xmid/2273/xmfid/12.aspx Twee Belgische wetenschappers bewezen diensten aan tabakslobby] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613085116/http://www.eosmagazine.eu/home/ctl/Detail/mid/485/xmid/2273/xmfid/12.aspx |date=June 13, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that while indeed he gave two presentations for ARISE in which he presented his visions, he wasn't paid to do so and he never was a member of ARISE. However, the [[Legacy Tobacco Documents Library]] contains a document&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/tid/puy87e00/pdf |title=ARISE |publisher=Legacy.library.ucsf.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; that lists Van Dun as an "associate".

A '''government platform''' is a [[political platform]] of a government. A new government, when entering office, lists their objectives to be accomplished while in office.

Government platforms are especially important in [[coalition government]]s, where several parties with possibly conflicting [[political platform]]s agree on a compromise. The distinction between a party platform and a government platform may be blurred in countries where single parties often form governments, but the distinction is still significant.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11405">The '''Handschu agreement''' is a set of guidelines that regulate police behavior in [[New York City]] with regard to political activity.

==Background==
In 1971, 21 members of the [[Black Panther Party]] were tried for conspiracy to blow up police stations and department stores. They were acquitted of all charges after only 90 minutes of jury deliberation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LOkYzy4t2VEC&amp;pg=PA74&amp;lpg=PA74&amp;dq=1971+new+york+panther+21+acquitted&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=awUaLAZn0z&amp;sig=_oyKmE0C-cSVljTz7DF9PDo56S0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1ShGUrm9E-GkyQGQyoHwAg&amp;ved=0CFsQ6AEwCTge#v=onepage&amp;q=1971%20new%20york%20panther%2021%20acquitted&amp;f=false | title =Warfare in the American Homeland: Policing and Prison in a Penal Democracy | author =Joy James | author2 =''[[Duke University]]'' | isbn =978-0822339236 | pages =74 | publisher =books.google.com | year =2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trial revealed the extent to which the NYPD had infiltrated and kept dossiers on not only the Black Panthers and other radical groups, but also on [[anti-war]] groups, [[gay rights]] activists, educational reform advocates, religious groups, and civic organizations.&lt;ref name ="ApuzzoGoldberg"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-UWBLg4JRmAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q=black%20panther&amp;f=false | title =Enemies Within: Inside the NYPD's Secret Spying Unit and bin Laden's Final Plot Against America | author =Matt Apuzzo, Adam Goldberg| author2 =''[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]'' | isbn =978-1476727936 | pages =44 | publisher =books.google.com | year =2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Handschu agreement, or decree, was the result of a [[class-action lawsuit]] filed against the City of New York, its Police Commissioner and the Intelligence Division of the New York City Police Department (NYPD) on behalf of [[Barbara Handschu]] and fifteen other [[plaintiffs]] affiliated with various political or ideological associations and organizations, known as ''Handschu v. Special Services Division'', 605 F.Supp. 1384, affirmed 787 F.2d 828.&lt;ref name ="HandschuNYTimes"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://graphics.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/nyregion/20070215_nycruling.pdf | title =Handschu v. Special Services Division | author =''[[New York Times]]'' | publisher =nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plaintiffs claimed that "informers and infiltrators provoked, solicited and induced members of lawful political and social groups to engage in unlawful activities"; that files were maintained with respect to "persons, places, and activities entirely unrelated to legitimate law enforcement purposes, such as those attending meetings of lawful organizations"; and that information from these files was made available to academic institutions, prospective employers, licensing agencies and others. In addition, plaintiffs protested seven types of police misconduct: (1) the use of informers; (2) infiltration; (3) interrogation; (4) overt surveillance; (5) summary punishment; (6) intelligence gathering; and (7) electronic surveillance, and alleged that these police practices which punished and repressed lawful dissent had had a "chilling effect" upon the exercise of freedom of speech, assembly and association, that they violated constitutional prohibitions against unreasonable searches and seizures, and that they abridged rights of privacy and due process.&lt;ref name="Arthur N. Eisenberg"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nyclu.org/content/testimony-police-surveillance-of-political-activity-history-and-current-state-of-handschu-de| author=Arthur N. Eisenberg| title=Testimony: Police Surveillance of Political Activity -- The History and Current State of the Handschu Decree| publisher=New York Civil Liberties Union| accessdate=January 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, the court found that police surveillance of political activity violated [[United States Constitution|constitutional]] protections of [[free speech]].&lt;ref name ="HandschuNYTimes"/&gt; This ruling resulted in a [[consent decree]] which prohibited the NYPD from engaging "in any investigation of political activity except through the … Intelligence Division [of the Police Department]" and required that any "such investigations shall be conducted" only in accordance with the Guidelines incorporated into the Decree. The Guidelines further prohibited the Intelligence Division from "commencing an investigation" into the political, ideological or religious activities of an individual or group unless "specific information has been received by the Police Department that a person or group engaged in political activity is engaged in, about to engage in or has threatened to engage in conduct which constitutes a crime…."&lt;ref name="Arthur N. Eisenberg"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/24/nypd-intelligence-chief-agents-mosque | title =NYPD intelligence chief wanted sources in every mosque within 250 miles | author =Ryan Devereaux | publisher =theguardian.com | date =February 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provisions==
According to the terms of the agreement, purely political activity can only be investigated by the Public Security Section (PSS) of the NYPD's Intelligence Division, and then only when the Section suspects criminal activity. When the PSS does suspect criminal activity on the part of political groups, it must obtain a warrant from the three-person Handschu Authority, a commission made up of two deputy commissioners and a mayor-appointed civilian.

The agreement also prohibits indiscriminate police videorecording and photographing of public gatherings when there is no indication that unlawful activity is occurring.

The department is also prohibited from sharing information pertaining to political activity with other law enforcement agencies unless those agencies agree to abide by the terms of the Handschu agreement.

The court order mandates the compiling of annual, publicly available reports listing the surveillance requests made by the NYPD and the number of such requests granted.

==Current status==
In 2002, the NYPD asked federal judge [[Charles S. Haight, Jr.]], the judge who presided over the original case, to abrogate numerous provisions of the agreement, claiming that they inhibited the department's ability to prevent future [[terrorist]] attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The department also requested that the function of the Handschu authority be changed to investigating complaints of constitutional violations, which would take away the authority's power to oversee political investigations.

In regards to the requested changes, Police Commissioner [[Raymond W. Kelly]] said, "Today we live in a more dangerous, constantly changing world, one with challenges and threats that were never envisioned when the Handschu guidelines were written."&lt;ref name="NYT2002"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/26/nyregion/threats-responses-surveillance-police-ask-change-rules-ease-restrictions.html | title =THREATS AND RESPONSES: SURVEILLANCE; Police Ask to Change the Rules and Ease Restrictions on Political Investigations | author =Kevin Flynn, Jacob H. Fries | publisher =nytimes.com | date =September 26, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chris Dunn of the New York [[American Civil Liberties Union|Civil Liberties Union]], called the proposal "troubling," stating that the NYPD "has no legitimate reason to spy on lawful political activity."&lt;ref name="NYT2002"/&gt;

Former New York City mayor [[Ed Koch]], previously a critic of police surveillance, agreed with the proposal to rescind large portions of the Handschu agreement. "That's the necessary cost of protecting the public in these times where we're dealing with terrorism," he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

On February 11, 2003, Haight ruled that the NYPD should be permitted to modify the 1985 Decree, but not to the extent originally requested by the City. The judge instructed the city to adapt the [[U.S. Attorney General]]'s Guidelines on General Crimes, Racketeering Enterprise and Terrorism Enterprise Investigations, issued by Attorney General [[John Ashcroft]] in May, 2002. This weakened the original decree in that a preliminary inquiry could be initiated when there is "information … which indicates the possibility of criminal activity."&lt;ref name="Arthur N. Eisenberg"/&gt;

In February 2007, [[Charles S. Haight, Jr.|Judge Haight]] ruled that the NYPD had violated the terms of the agreement by videotaping two demonstrations by advocates of the [[homeless]], one in [[Harlem]] in March 2005, the other in front of New York City Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]]'s house in December 2005. On June 13, 2007, Haight reversed the ruling, saying that attorneys for the city had provided new evidence indicating that the protestors may have been "disorderly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

With a population of 49,192, it is the [[List of cities in Pennsylvania by population|15th largest city]] in the Commonwealth. It lies on the east bank of the [[Susquehanna River]], {{convert|107|mi|km}} west of [[Philadelphia]]. Harrisburg is the anchor of the [[Harrisburg–Carlisle metropolitan statistical area|Susquehanna Valley]] metropolitan area, which had a 2017 estimated population of 571,903,&lt;ref name="census"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/2010census/ |title=2010 Census |publisher=census.gov |accessdate=2014-05-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6M1KRmETR?url=http://www.census.gov/2010census/ |archivedate=2013-12-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the third most populous in Pennsylvania and [[List of metropolitan statistical areas|96th most populous]] in the United States.

Harrisburg played a notable role in American history during the [[Frontier|Westward Migration]], the [[American Civil War]], and the [[Industrial Revolution]]. During part of the 19th century, the building of the [[Pennsylvania Main Line of Public Works|Pennsylvania Canal]] and later the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] allowed Harrisburg to become one of the most industrialized cities in the [[Northeastern United States]]. The [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] ship [[USS Harrisburg|USS ''Harrisburg'']], which served from 1918 to 1919 at the end of World War I, was named in honor of the city. In the mid-to-late 20th century, the city's economic fortunes fluctuated with its major industries consisting of government, [[Heavy industry|heavy manufacturing]], [[agriculture]], and food services (nearby [[Hershey, Pennsylvania|Hershey]] is home of the [[The Hershey Company|chocolate maker]], located just {{convert|10|mi|km}} east).

The [[Pennsylvania Farm Show]], the largest free indoor agriculture exposition in the United States, was first held in Harrisburg in 1917 and has been held there every early-to-mid January since then.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pabookstore.com/75fashhiofpe.html 75th Farm Show: A History of Pennsylvania's Annual Agricultural Exposition] Dan Cupper, Accessed January 29, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Harrisburg also hosts an annual [[Eastern Sports and Outdoor Show|outdoor sports]] show, the largest of its kind in North America, an [[Pennsylvania Auto Show|auto show]], which features a large static display of new as well as classic cars and is renowned nationwide, and Motorama, a two-day event consisting of a car show, [[Motocross|motocross racing]], remote control car racing, and more. Harrisburg is also known for the [[Three Mile Island accident]], which occurred on March 28, 1979, near [[Middletown, Dauphin County, Pennsylvania|Middletown]].

In 2010 ''[[Forbes]]'' rated Harrisburg as the second best place in the U.S. to raise a family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url = https://www.forbes.com/2010/06/04/best-places-family-lifestyle-real-estate-cities-kids.html | title = America's Best Places to Raise a Family | work=Forbes | first=Francesca | last=Levy | date=June 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the city's recent financial troubles, in 2010 [[The Daily Beast]] website ranked 20 metropolitan areas across the country as being recession-proof, and the Harrisburg region landed at No. 7.&lt;ref name="beast"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2010/08/harrisburg_area_ranked_among_t.html| year=2010| title=Harrisburg area ranked among Top 10 recession-proof cities| publisher=[[The Patriot-News|Harrisburg Patriot News]]| accessdate=2011-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The financial stability of the region is in part due to the high concentration of [[Government of Pennsylvania|state]] and [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] government agencies.

==History==
{{Main|History of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania}}{{See also|Timeline of Harrisburg history}}

===Founding===
Harrisburg's site along the [[Susquehanna River]] is thought to have been inhabited by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] as early as 3000 BC. Known to the Native Americans as "Peixtin", or "[[Paxtang, Pennsylvania|Paxtang]]", the area was an important resting place and crossroads for Native American traders, as the trails leading from the Delaware to the Ohio rivers, and from the Potomac to the Upper Susquehanna intersected there. The first European contact with Native Americans in Pennsylvania was made by the Englishman, [[John Smith of Jamestown|Captain John Smith]], who journeyed from [[Virginia]] up the Susquehanna River in 1608 and visited with the [[Susquehannock|Susquehanna]] tribe. In 1719, [[John Harris, Sr.]], an English trader, settled here and 14 years later secured grants of {{convert|800|acre|km2}} in this vicinity. In 1785, [[John Harris, Jr.]] made plans to lay out a town on his father's land, which he named Harrisburg. In the spring of 1785, the town was formally surveyed by [[William Maclay (politician)|William Maclay]], who was a son-in-law of John Harris, Sr. In 1791, Harrisburg became incorporated, and in October 1812 it was named the Pennsylvania state capital, which it has remained ever since.
The assembling here of the highly sectional Harrisburg Convention in 1827 (signaling what may have been the birth of lobbying on a national scale) led to the passage of the high [[Tariff of 1828|protective-tariff bill]] of 1828.&lt;ref&gt;W. Kesler Jackson, "Robbers and Incediaries: Protectionism Organizes at the Harrisburg Convention of 1827," Libertarian Papers 2, 21 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1839, [[William Henry Harrison|Harrison]] and [[John Tyler|Tyler]] were nominated for [[President of the United States]] at the first [[1839 Whig National Convention|national convention]] of the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] of the United States, which was held in Harrisburg.

===Pre-industry: 1800–1850===
Before Harrisburg gained its first industries, it was a scenic, pastoral town, typical of most of the day: compact and surrounded by farmland. In 1822, the impressive brick capitol was completed for $200,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gilbert, Stephanie Patterson|url=http://www.old8thward.com/pdf/PattersonGilbertweb.pdf |title=Harrisburg's Old Eight Ward: Constructing a Website for Student Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was Harrisburg's strategic location which gave it an advantage over many other towns.  It was settled as a trading post in 1719 at a location important to Westward expansion. The importance of the location was that it was at a pass in a mountain ridge. The Susquehanna River flowed generally west to east at this location, providing a route for boat traffic from the east.  The head of navigation was a short distance northwest of the town, where the river flowed through the pass. Persons arriving from the east by boat had to exit at Harrisburg and prepare for an overland journey westward through the mountain pass.  Harrisburg assumed importance as a provisioning stop at this point where westward bound pioneers transitioned from river travel to overland travel. It was partly because of its strategic location that the state legislature selected the small town of Harrisburg to become the state capital in 1812.

The grandeur of the Colonial Revival capitol dominated the quaint town. The streets were dirt, but orderly and platted in grid pattern.  The Pennsylvania Canal was built in 1834 and coursed the length of the town. The residential houses were situated on only a few city blocks stretching southward from the capitol. They were mostly one story. No factories were present but there were blacksmith shops and other businesses.&lt;ref name="Eggert, Gerald G. 1993. p58"&gt;Eggert, Gerald G., Harrisburg Industrializes: The Coming of Factories to an American Community. University Park, PA: The Pennsylvania State University Press, 1993. p58&lt;/ref&gt;

===American Civil War===
{{Main|Harrisburg in the American Civil War}}
During the [[American Civil War]], Harrisburg was a significant training center for the [[Union Army]], with tens of thousands of troops passing through [[Camp Curtin]]. It was also a major rail center for the Union and a vital link between the Atlantic coast and the Midwest, with several railroads running through the city and spanning the Susquehanna River. As a result of this importance, it was a target of [[General]] [[Robert E. Lee]]'s [[Army of Northern Virginia]] during its two invasions. The first time during the 1862 [[Maryland Campaign]], when Lee planned to capture the city after taking [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia]], but was prevented from doing so by the [[Battle of Antietam]] and his subsequent retreat back into Virginia. The second attempt was made during the [[Gettysburg Campaign]] in 1863 and was more substantial. The [[Skirmish of Sporting Hill]] took place in June 1863 in [[Camp Hill, Pennsylvania|Camp Hill]], just {{convert|2|mi|km|0}} west of Harrisburg. This is considered by many to have been the northern-most battle of the Civil War.

During the first part of the 19th century, Harrisburg was a notable stopping place along the [[Underground Railroad]], as [[History of slavery in the United States|escaped slaves]] being transported across the Susquehanna River were often fed and supplied before heading north towards Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://alpha.dickinson.edu/departments/hist/NEHworkshops/NEH/resource/ugrrDocs.htm#harrisburg] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060920215954/http://alpha.dickinson.edu/departments/hist/NEHworkshops/NEH/resource/ugrrDocs.htm |date=2006-09-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industrial rise: 1850–1920===
[[File:Hb market street.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Postcard depicting Market Street in [[Downtown Harrisburg]] as it appeared in 1910. [[Tram|Trolley]] tracks are noticeable along the street.]]
Harrisburg's importance in the latter half of the 19th century was in the steel industry.  It was an important railroad center as well. [[Iron and steel industry|Steel and iron]] became dominant industries. Steel and other industries continued to play a major role in the local economy throughout the latter part of the 19th century. The city was the center of enormous railroad traffic and its steel industry supported large furnaces, rolling mills, and machine shops. The Pennsylvania Steel Company plant, which opened in nearby [[Steelton, Pennsylvania|Steelton]] in 1866, was the first in the country; later operated by [[Bethlehem Steel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.steeltonpa.com/history.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130306040045/http://www.steeltonpa.com/history.asp |archivedate=2013-03-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 3, 1863, the artillery barrage that marked the beginning of [[Pickett's Charge]] of the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] was heard from Harrisburg, almost 40 miles away.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_8-53Rn7pY GETTYSBURG - The Artillery Duel- YouTube&amp;#91;2&amp;#93; ]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Its first large scale iron foundries were put into operation shortly after 1850.&lt;ref name="Eggert, Gerald G. 1993. p58"/&gt;
As industries nationwide entered a phase of great expansion and technological improvement, so did industries&amp;nbsp;– and in particular the steel industry&amp;nbsp;– in Harrisburg.  This can be attributed to a combination of factors that were typical of what existed in other successful industrial cities: rapid rail expansion; nearby markets for goods; and nearby sources for raw product.
With Harrisburg poised for growth in steel production, the Borough of Steelton became the ideal location for this type of industry.  It was a wide swath of flat land located south of the city, with rail and canal access running its entire 4 mile length.  There was plenty of room for houses and its own downtown section. Steelton was a company town, opened in 1866 by the Pennsylvania Steel Company.  Highly innovative in its steel making process, it became the first mill in the United States to make steel railroad rails by contract.  In its heyday Steelton was home to more than 16,000 residents from 33 different ethnic groups.  All were employed in the steel industry, or had employment in services that supported it.  In the late 19th century, no less than five major steel mills and foundries were located in Steelton. Each contained a maze of buildings; conveyances for moving the products; large yards for laying down equipment; and facilities for loading their product on trains. Stacks from these factories constantly belched smoke. With housing and a small downtown area within walking distance, these were the sights and smells that most Steelton residents saw every day.

The rail yard was another area of Harrisburg that saw rapid and thorough change during the years of industrialization. This was a wide expanse of about two dozen railroad tracks that grew from the single track of the early 1850s.  By the late 19th century, this area was the width of about two city blocks and formed what amounted to a barrier along the eastern edge of the city: passable only by bridge.  Three large and ornately embellished passenger depots were built by as many rail lines.  Pennsylvania Railroad was the largest rail line in Harrisburg.  It built huge repair facilities and two large roundhouses in the 1860s and 1870s to handle its enormous freight and passenger traffic and to maintain its colossal infrastructure.  Its rails ran the length of Harrisburg, along its eastern border.   It had a succession of three passenger depots, each built on the site of the predecessor, and each of high style architecture, including a train shed to protect passengers from inclement weather.  At its peak in 1904, it made 100 passenger stops per day.  It extended westward to Pittsburgh; across the entire state.  It also went eastward to Philadelphia, serving Steelton en route. The vital anthracite coal mines in the Allegheny Mountains were reached by the Northern Central Railroad.  The Lebanon Valley Railroad extended eastward to Philadelphia with spurs to New York City.  Another rail line was the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad which provided service to Philadelphia and other points east.&lt;ref&gt;Eggert, Gerald G., Harrisburg Industrializes: The Coming of Factories to an American Community. University Park, PA: The Pennsylvania State University Press, 1993. p40&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industrial decline: 1920–70===
The decades between 1920 and 1970 were characterized by [[deindustrialization|industrial decline]] and population shift from the city to the suburbs. Like most other cities which faced a loss of their industrial base, Harrisburg shifted to a service-oriented base, with industries such as health care and convention centers playing a big role. Harrisburg's greatest problem was a shrinking city population after 1950.  This loss in population followed a national trend and was a delayed result of the decline of Harrisburg's steel industry. This decline began almost imperceptibly in the late 1880s, but did not become evident until the early 20th century.

After being held in place for about 5 years by WWII armament production, the population peaked shortly after the war, but then took a long-overdue dive as people fled from the city.  Hastening the flight to the suburbs were the cheap and available houses being built away from the crime and deteriorating situation of the city. The reduction in city population coincided with the rise in population of the Metropolitan Statistical Area. The trend continued until the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Eggert, Gerald G., Harrisburg Industrializes: The Coming of Factories to an American Community. University Park, PA: The Pennsylvania State University Press, 1993. p339&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beginning of Harrisburg's suburbs: 1880s===

The gradual loss of industry, especially after WWII, coupled with the proliferation of the street car and later the automobile, led to urban flight to the suburbs.  Allison Hill was Harrisburg's first suburb. It was located east of the city on a prominent bluff, accessed by bridges across a wide swath of train tracks.  It was developed in the late 19th century and offered affluent Harrisburgers the opportunity to live in the suburbs only a few hundred yards from their jobs in the City.  Easy access was achieved via the State Street Bridge leading east from the Capitol complex and the Market Street Bridge leading from the City's prominent business district.  In 1886 a single horse trolley line was established from the city to Allison Hill.  The most desirable section of Allison Hill was Mount Pleasant, which was characterized by large Colonial Revival style houses with yards for the very wealthy and smaller but still well-built row houses lining the main street for the moderately wealthy. State Street, leading from the Capitol directly toward Allison Hill, was planned to provide a grand view of the Capitol dome for those approaching the City from Allison Hill. This trend towards outlying residential areas began slowly in the late 19th century and was largely confined to the trolley line, but the growth of automobile ownership quickened the trend and spread out the population.

===20th century===

In the early 20th century, the city of Harrisburg was in need of change. Without proper sanitation, diseases such as [[Typhoid fever|typhoid]] began killing many citizens of Harrisburg. Seeing these necessary changes, several Harrisburg residents became involved in the [[City Beautiful movement]]. Mira Lloyd Dock spearheaded the movement with an impressive speech before the city's Board of Trade. Other prominent citizens of the city such as  [[J. Horace McFarland]] and [[Vance McCormick]] advocated urban improvements which were influenced by European urban planning design and the [[World's Columbian Exposition]]. [[Warren Manning]] was hired to help bring about these changes.  Specifically, their efforts greatly enlarged the Harrisburg park system, creating Riverfront Park, Reservoir Park, the Italian Lake and Wildwood Park.  In addition, schemes were undertaken for the burial of electric wires, the creation of a modern sanitary sewer system, and the beautification of an expanded [[Pennsylvania State Capitol Complex|Capitol complex]].

The [[Pennsylvania Farm Show]], the largest indoor agriculture exposition in the United States, was first held in 1917 and has been held every January since then. The present location of the Show is the [[Pennsylvania State Farm Show Arena]], located at the corner of Maclay and [[Cameron Street|Cameron]] streets.

In June 1972, Harrisburg was hit by a major flood from the remnants of hurricane [[Hurricane Agnes|Agnes]].

On March 28, 1979, the [[Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station|Three Mile Island]] nuclear plant, along the [[Susquehanna River]] located in Londonderry Township which is south of Harrisburg, suffered a partial meltdown. Although the meltdown was contained and radiation leakages were minimal, there were still worries that an evacuation would be necessary. Governor [[Dick Thornburgh]], on the advice of [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] Chairman [[Joseph Hendrie]], advised the evacuation "of pregnant women and pre-school age children ... within a five-mile radius of the Three Mile Island facility." Within days, 140,000 people had left the area.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/tmi/stories/decade032889.htm A Decade Later, TMI's Legacy Is Mistrust] ''[[The Washington Post]]'', March 28, 1989, p. A01.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stephen R. Reed]] was elected mayor in 1981 and served until 2009, making him the city's longest serving mayor. In an effort to end the city's long period of economic troubles, he initiated several projects to attract new business and tourism to the city. Several museums and hotels such as [[Whitaker Center for Science and the Arts]], the [[National Civil War Museum]] and the [[Hilton Hotels|Hilton Harrisburg and Towers]] were built during his term, along with many office buildings and residential structures. Several minor league professional sports franchises, including the [[Harrisburg Senators]] of the [[Eastern League (U.S. baseball)|Eastern League]], the [[Harrisburg Heat (1991–2003)|Harrisburg Heat]] indoor soccer club, and [[Penn FC]] of the [[United Soccer League]] began operations in the city during his tenure as mayor. While praised for the vast number of economic improvements, Reed has also been criticized for population loss and mounting debt. For example, during a budget crisis the city was forced to sell $8 million worth of Western and American-Indian artifacts collected by Mayor Reed for a never-realized museum celebrating the [[American West]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.pennlive.com/patriotnews/2007/05/160151-harrisburgs_western_artifacts.html|title=Harrisburg rounds up Western artifacts for auction&amp;nbsp;– The Patriot News&amp;nbsp;– Brief Article (May 2007)|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110917155734/http://blog.pennlive.com/patriotnews/2007/05/160151-harrisburgs_western_artifacts.html|archivedate=2011-09-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the nearly 30-year tenure of former Mayor [[Stephen R. Reed|Stephen Reed]] from 1981 to 2009, city officials ignored legal restraints on the use of bond proceeds, as Reed spent the money pursuing interests including collecting Civil War and Wild West memorabilia—some which was found in Reed's home after his arrest on corruption charges.&lt;ref name="MyUser_Pennlive.com_August_12_2015c"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2015/07/reed_kane_corruption_harrisbur.html |title=Harrisburg corruption charges portray former mayor Stephen Reed as unhinged from normal checks and balances |newspaper=Pennlive.com |date=July 14, 2015  |author=Charles Thompson |accessdate= August 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Infrastructure was left unrepaired, and the heart of the city's financial woes was a trash to electricity plant, the Harrisburg incinerator that was supposed to generate income but instead because of increased borrowing, incurred a debt of $320 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Corkery|first=Michael|title=The Incinerator That Kept Burning Cash|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903532804576564882240033792|accessdate=|newspaper=WSJ|date=September 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Missing audits, convoluted transactions, including swap agreements make it difficult to state how much debt the city owes.

Bodies of water include [[Paxton Creek]] which empties into the [[Susquehanna River]] at Harrisburg, as well as [[Wildwood Park (Pennsylvania)|Wildwood Lake]] and [[Italian Lake (Harrisburg)|Italian Lake]] parks.

Directly to the north of Harrisburg is the [[Blue Mountain (Pennsylvania)|Blue Mountain]] ridge of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. The [[Cumberland Valley]] lies directly to the west of Harrisburg and the Susquehanna River, stretching into northern [[Maryland]]. The fertile [[Lebanon Valley]] lies to the east. Harrisburg is the northern fringe of the historic [[Pennsylvania Dutch Country]].

Harrisburg's western boundary is formed by the west shore of the [[Susquehanna River]] (the Susquehanna runs within the city boundaries), which also serves as the boundary between [[Dauphin County, Pennsylvania|Dauphin]] and [[Cumberland County, Pennsylvania|Cumberland]] counties. The city is divided into numerous neighborhoods and districts. Like many of Pennsylvania's cities and [[borough (Pennsylvania)|boroughs]] that are at "build-out" stage, there are several townships outside of Harrisburg city limits that, although autonomous, use the name ''Harrisburg'' for postal and name-place designation. They include the townships of: [[Lower Paxton Township, Pennsylvania|Lower Paxton]], [[Middle Paxton Township, Pennsylvania|Middle Paxton]], [[Susquehanna Township, Dauphin County, Pennsylvania|Susquehanna]], [[Swatara Township, Dauphin County, Pennsylvania|Swatara]] and [[West Hanover Township, Pennsylvania|West Hanover]] in Dauphin County.

===Neighborhoods===
{{See also|List of Harrisburg neighborhoods}}
[[Downtown Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Center City]] Harrisburg, which includes the [[Pennsylvania State Capitol Complex]], is the central core business and financial center for the greater [[Harrisburg metropolitan area]] and serves as the seat of government for [[Dauphin County, Pennsylvania|Dauphin County]] and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. There are over a dozen large neighborhoods and historic districts within the city.

===Architecture===
Harrisburg is home to the [[Pennsylvania State Capitol]]. Completed in 1906, the central dome rises to a height of {{convert|272|ft}} and was modeled on that of [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in [[Vatican City]], Rome. The building was designed by [[Joseph Miller Huston]] and is adorned with sculpture, most notably the two groups'', Love and Labor, the Unbroken Law'' and ''The Burden of Life, the Broken Law'' by sculptor [[George Grey Barnard]]; murals by [[Violet Oakley]] and [[Edwin Austin Abbey]]; tile floor by [[Henry Mercer]], which tells the story of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The state capitol is only the third-tallest building of Harrisburg. The five tallest buildings are 333 Market Street with a height of {{convert|341|ft}}, Pennsylvania Place with a height of {{convert|291|ft}}, the Pennsylvania State Capitol with a height of {{convert|272|ft}}, Presbyterian Apartments with a height of {{convert|259|ft}} and the Fulton Bank Building with a height of {{convert|255|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/ci/bu?id=101858|title=Buildings of Harrisburg|publisher=[[Emporis]]|accessdate=2008-09-29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070321111648/http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/ci/bu/?id=101858|archivedate=2007-03-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The very first census taken in the United States occurred in 1790. At that time Harrisburg was a small, but substantial [[Colonial history of the United States of America|colonial]] town with a population of 875 residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0027.html |title=Population of the 100 Largest Cities 1790 to 1990 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314031958/http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0027.html |archivedate=2007-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the increase of the city's prominence as an industrial and transportation center, Harrisburg reached its peak population build up in 1950, topping out at nearly 90,000 residents. Since the 1950s, Harrisburg, along with other northeastern urban centers large and small, has experienced a declining population that is ultimately fueling the growth of its [[suburbs]], although the decline&amp;nbsp;– which was very rapid in the 1960s and 1970s&amp;nbsp;– has slowed considerably since the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Eggert"&gt;"Harrisburg Industrializes, The coming of factories to an American community", Eggert, Gerald G.; The Pennsylvania State University Press, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[Sun Belt|Western and Southern states]], Pennsylvania maintains a complex system of municipalities and has very little legislation on either the annexation/expansion of cities or the consolidating of municipal entities.

Reversing fifty years of decline, 2004 Census Bureau estimates show that Harrisburg's population has actually grown. Between 2004 and 2006, Harrisburg gained 22 people. In 2006, the urban population of the Harrisburg area increased to 383,008 from 362,782 in 2000, a change of 20,226 people.&lt;ref name="urbanpop"&gt;[http://proximityone.com/urbanpopulation.htm America's Urban Population: Patterns &amp; Characteristics 2000-2009] Proximity, 2003 data, Retrieved January 21, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 the Harrisburg area was listed with [[Lebanon, Pennsylvania|Lebanon]] and [[York, Pennsylvania|York]] as an urban agglomeration, or a contiguous area of continuously developed urban land,&lt;ref name="urbanpop2"&gt;[http://proximityone.com/urbanagglomerations.htm America's Urban Agglomerations 2010] Proximity, Retrieved January 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; signifying a future merger of the York-[[Hanover, Pennsylvania|Hanover]] and [[Harrisburg metropolitan area]]s, which would create a metropolitan area of over 1 million.

[[File:Kunkel Building Nov 10.JPG|thumb|right|170px|The Kunkel Building, built in 1913, was home to the [[Susquehanna Art Museum]] until December 2010.]]
Downtown Harrisburg has two major performance centers. The [[Whitaker Center for Science and the Arts]], which was completed in 1999, is the first center of its type in the United States where education, science and the [[performing arts]] take place under one roof. The Forum, a 1,763-seat concert and lecture hall built in 1930-31, is a state-owned and operated facility located within the [[Pennsylvania State Capitol Complex|State Capitol Complex]]. Since 1931, The Forum has been home to the [[Harrisburg Symphony Orchestra]].

Beginning in 2001, downtown Harrisburg saw a surge of commercial nightlife development. This has been credited with reversing the city's financial decline, and has made downtown Harrisburg a destination for events from jazz festivals to Top-40 nightclubs.

Harrisburg is also the home of the annual [[Pennsylvania Farm Show]], the largest [[Agricultural show|agricultural exhibition]] of its kind in the nation. Farmers from all over Pennsylvania come to show their animals and participate in competitions. Livestock are on display for people to interact with and view. In 2004, Harrisburg hosted [[CowParade]], an international public [[art exhibit]] that has been featured in major cities all over the world. Fiberglass sculptures of cows are decorated by local artists, and distributed over the city center, in public places such as train stations and parks. They often feature artwork and designs specific to local culture, as well as city life and other relevant themes.

==Sports==
{{Main|Sports in South Central Pennsylvania}}
Harrisburg serves as the hub of professional sports in [[South Central Pennsylvania]]. A host of teams compete in the region including three professional baseball teams, the [[Harrisburg Senators]], the [[Lancaster Barnstormers]], and the [[York Revolution]].  The Senators are the oldest team of the three, with the current incarnation playing since 1987. The original Harrisburg Senators began playing in the [[Eastern League (baseball)|Eastern League]] in 1924.  Playing its home games at [[City Island (Pennsylvania)|Island Field]], the team won the league championship in the 1927, 1928, and 1931 seasons.  The Senators played a few more seasons before flood waters destroyed Island Field in 1936, effectively ending Eastern League participation for fifty-one years.  In 1940, Harrisburg gained an Interstate League team affiliated with the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]]; however, the team remained in the city only until 1943, when it moved to nearby [[York, Pennsylvania|York]] and renamed the [[York Pirates]].  The current Harrisburg Senators, affiliated with the [[Washington Nationals]], have won the Eastern League championship in the 1987, 1993, 1996, 1997, 1998, and 1999 seasons.

===City of Harrisburg===
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:Pa state cap 2.gif|thumb|200px|right|State Capitol and adjacent government complex – from overhead.]] --&gt;
{{Main|List of mayors of Harrisburg|Harrisburg City Council}}
Dr. [[Martin Luther King, Jr]]. City Government Center, the only city hall in the United States named for a [[Civil Rights Movement]] leader, serves as a central location for the administrative functions of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harrisburgpa.gov/visitors/centerCity/centralBusiness3.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-12-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050830165308/http://www.harrisburgpa.gov/visitors/centerCity/centralBusiness3.html |archivedate=2005-08-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Harrisburg has been served since 1970 by the "[[Mayor-council government|strong mayor]]" form of municipal government, with separate executive and legislative branches. The Mayor serves a four-year term with no term limits. As the full-time chief executive, the Mayor oversees the operation of 34 agencies, run by department and office heads, some of whom comprise the Mayor's cabinet, including the Departments of Public Safety (police and fire bureaus), Public Works, Business Administration, Parks and Recreation, Incineration and Steam Generation, Building &amp; Housing Development and Solicitor. The city has 721 employees (2003).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.city-data.com/us-cities/The-Northeast/Harrisburg-Municipal-Government.html |title=Harrisburg: Municipal Government |website=City-data.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current mayor of Harrisburg is [[Eric R. Papenfuse]] whose term expires January 2018.

There are seven [[Harrisburg City Council|city council]] members, all elected at large, who serve part-time for four-year terms. There are two other elected city posts, [[City Treasurer|city treasurer]] and [[Comptroller|city controller]], who separately head their own fiscally related offices.

The city government has been in financial distress for many years. It has operated under the state's Act 47 provisions since 2011. The Act provides for municipalities that are in a state akin to bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McCabe|title=Colwyn: Can this town be saved?|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/news/20150525_Colwyn__Can_this_town_be_saved_.html|accessdate=26 May 2015|publisher=Philadelphia Daily News|date=25 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Property tax reform====
Harrisburg is also known nationally for its use of a two-tiered [[Land value tax in the United States|land value taxation]]. Harrisburg has [[Land value tax|taxed land]] at a rate six times that on improvements since 1975, and this policy has been credited by its former mayor [[Stephen R. Reed]], as well as by the city's former [[city manager]] during the 1980s, with reducing the number of [[Abandoned property|vacant structures]] located in [[downtown Harrisburg]] from about 4,200 in 1982 to fewer than 500 in 1995.&lt;ref name="earth"&gt;[http://www.earthrights.net/docs/success.html Pennsylvania's Success with Local Property Tax Reform: The Split Rate Tax] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208235315/http://www.earthrights.net/docs/success.html |date=2009-02-08 }} Earth Rights Institute. Hartzok, Alanna. 1995. Accessed February 12, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; During this same period of time between 1982 and 1995, nearly 4,700 more city residents became employed, the crime rate dropped 22.5% and the fire rate dropped 51%.&lt;ref name="earth" /&gt;

Harrisburg, as well as nearly 20 other [[Pennsylvania]] cities, employs a ''two-rate'' or ''split-rate'' [[property tax]], which requires the taxing of the value of land at a higher rate and the value of the buildings and improvements at a lower one. This can be seen as a compromise between pure LVT and an ordinary property tax falling on real estate (land value plus improvement value).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lincolninst.edu/pubs/dl/1275_Hughes%20Final.pdf |author=Mark Alan Hughes |title=Why So Little Georgism in America: Using the Pennsylvania Case Files to Understand the Slow, Uneven Progress of Land Value Taxation |publisher=[[Lincoln Institute of Land Policy]] |date=2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140823024415/https://www.lincolninst.edu/pubs/dl/1275_Hughes%20Final.pdf |archivedate=2014-08-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, two-rate taxation may be seen as a form that allows gradual transformation of the traditional real estate property tax into a pure land value tax.

Nearly two dozen local Pennsylvania jurisdictions, such as Harrisburg,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcommonwealth.org/news/lvt-jurisdiction-rates |title=PA two-rate cities and rates as of Nov. 2009 |publisher=The Henry George Foundation of America |accessdate=2010-01-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110419232223/http://www.ourcommonwealth.org/news/lvt-jurisdiction-rates |archivedate=2011-04-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; use two-rate property taxation in which the tax on land value is higher and the tax on improvement value is lower. In 2000, Florenz Plassmann and [[Nicolaus Tideman]] wrote&lt;ref name="markovchain"&gt;"A Markov Chain Monte Carlo Analysis of the Effect of Two-Rate Property Taxes on Construction", Journal of Urban Economics, 2000, vol. 47, issue 2, p. 216-247&lt;/ref&gt; that when comparing Pennsylvania cities using a higher tax rate on land value and a lower rate on improvements with similar sized Pennsylvania cities using the same rate on land and improvements, the higher land value taxation leads to increased construction within the jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;Oates, W. &amp; Schwab, R. "The Impact of Urban Land Taxation: The Pittsburgh Experience." National Tax Journal L (March) 1-21. (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cord, S.

===Dauphin County===
[[File:Dauphin County Courthouse.jpg|right|thumb|[[Dauphin County Courthouse]], located along the [[Susquehanna River]] at Front and Market Streets in [[Downtown Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|downtown]] Harrisburg]]
Dauphin County Government Complex, in [[Central Business District (Downtown Harrisburg)|downtown]] Harrisburg, serves the administrative functions of the county. The [[trial court]] of general jurisdiction for Harrisburg rests with the [[Dauphin County, Pennsylvania|Court of Dauphin County]] and is largely funded and operated by county resources and employees.

===Commonwealth of Pennsylvania===
{{Main|Government of Pennsylvania}}
{{See also|List of Pennsylvania state agencies}}
The [[Pennsylvania State Capitol Complex]] dominates the city's stature as a regional and national hub for government and politics. All administrative functions of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania are located within the complex and at various nearby locations.

The Commonwealth Judicial Center houses Pennsylvania's three [[appellate courts]], which are located in Harrisburg. The [[Supreme Court of Pennsylvania]], which is the court of last resort in the state, hears arguments in Harrisburg as well as Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. The [[Superior Court of Pennsylvania]] and the [[Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania]] are located here. Judges for these courts are elected at large.

===Federal government===
The [[Ronald Reagan Federal Building and Courthouse (Pennsylvania)|Ronald Reagan Federal Building and Courthouse]], located in downtown Harrisburg, serves as the regional administrative offices of the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]]. A branch of the [[U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania]] is also located within the courthouse. Due to Harrisburg's prominence as the state capital, federal offices for nearly every agency are located within the city.

The [[United States Armed Forces|United States military]] has a strong historic presence in the region. A large retired military population resides in [[South Central Pennsylvania]] and the region is home to a large [[United States National Cemetery|national cemetery]] at [[Indiantown Gap National Cemetery|Indiantown Gap]]. The federal government, including the military, is the top employer in the [[Harrisburg metropolitan area|metropolitan area]].

Military bases in the Harrisburg area include:

==Transport==

===Airports===
Domestic and International airlines provide services via [[Harrisburg International Airport]] (MDT), which is located southeast of the city in [[Middletown, Dauphin County, Pennsylvania|Middletown]]. HIA is the third-busiest commercial [[airport]] in Pennsylvania, both in terms of passengers served and cargo shipments. But, generally due to the poor airline selection and lack of an airline hub, generally the most popular airports in the area are  [[Baltimore-Washington International Airport|Baltimore]], [[Washington Dulles International Airport|Dulles]] and the [[Philadelphia International Airport |Philadelphia]]. However nearly 1.2 million people fly out of Harrisburg every year.

&lt;ref name="trans"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harrisburgpa.gov/econProfile/transport.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121213062809/http://www.harrisburgpa.gov/econProfile/transport.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-12-13 |year=2006 |title=Transport in the Harrisburg area |last=City of Harrisburg |publisher=harrisburgpa.gov/ |accessdate=2007-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Passenger carriers that serve HIA include [[American Airlines]], [[United Airlines]], [[Delta Air Lines]], [[Frontier Airlines]], and [[Allegiant Air]]. [[Capital City Airport (Pennsylvania)|Capital City Airport]] (CXY), a moderate-sized business class and [[general aviation]] airport, is located across the Susquehanna River in the nearby suburb of [[New Cumberland, Pennsylvania|New Cumberland]], south of Harrisburg. Both airports are owned and operated by the [[Susquehanna Area Regional Airport Authority]] (SARAA), which also manages the [[Franklin County Regional Airport]] in [[Chambersburg, Pennsylvania|Chambersburg]] and [[Gettysburg Regional Airport]] in [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania|Gettysburg]].

===Public transit===
Harrisburg is served by [[Capital Area Transit (Harrisburg)|Capital Area Transit]] (CAT) which provides [[bus|public bus]], [[paratransit]], and [[CorridorOne|commuter rail]] service throughout the greater metropolitan area. Construction of a commuter rail line designated the [[Capital Red Rose Corridor]] (previously named CorridorOne) will eventually link the city with nearby [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtptransit.org/assets/pdf/Legislative%20Update%206%20-%2008%20Cap%20Red%20Rose.pdf New Name Unveiled for Harrisburg to Lancaster Proposed Rail Service] Modern Transit Partnership, accessed February 5, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;{{update after|2011|1}}

Long-term plans for the region call for the commuter rail line to continue westward to [[Cumberland County, Pennsylvania|Cumberland County]], ending at [[Carlisle, Pennsylvania|Carlisle]]. In early 2005, the project hit a roadblock when the Cumberland County [[County commission|commissioners]] opposed the plan to extend commuter rail to the West Shore. Due to lack of support from the county commissioners, the Cumberland County portion, and the two new stations in Harrisburg have been removed from the project. In the future, with support from Cumberland County, the commuter rail project may extend to both shores of the [[Susquehanna River]], where the majority of the commuting base for the [[Harrisburg metropolitan area]] resides.&lt;ref name="tcrpc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcrpc-pa.org/SRTP/SRTP_Chapter_05/corridorone.htm |year=2006 |title=CorridorOne in the Harrisburg Region |publisher=Tri-County Regional Planning Commission |accessdate=2007-01-24 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101164656/http://www.tcrpc-pa.org/SRTP/SRTP_Chapter_05/corridorone.htm |archivedate=2007-01-01 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, a second phase of the rail project designated CorridorTwo was announced to the general public. It will link [[Downtown Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|downtown]] Harrisburg with its eastern suburbs in [[Dauphin County, Pennsylvania|Dauphin]] and [[Lebanon County, Pennsylvania|Lebanon]] counties, including the areas of [[Hummelstown, Pennsylvania|Hummelstown]], [[Hershey, Pennsylvania|Hershey]] and [[Lebanon, Pennsylvania|Lebanon]], and the city of [[York, Pennsylvania|York]] in [[York County, Pennsylvania|York County]].&lt;ref name="tcrpc"/&gt; Future passenger rail corridors also include [[US Route 15|Route 15]] from the Harrisburg area towards [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania|Gettysburg]], as well as the Susquehanna River communities north of Harrisburg, and the Northern [[Susquehanna River|Susquehanna Valley]] region.&lt;ref name="tcrpc"/&gt;

===Intercity bus service===
The lower level of the Harrisburg Transport Center serves as the city's intercity [[Bus station|bus terminal]]. Daily bus services are provided by [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]], [[Trailways Transportation System|Capitol Trailways]], and [[Fullington Trailways]]. They connect Harrisburg to other Pennsylvania cities such as [[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]], Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, [[Reading, Pennsylvania|Reading]], [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]], [[State College, Pennsylvania|State College]], [[Williamsport, Pennsylvania|Williamsport]], and [[York, Pennsylvania|York]] and nearby, out-of-state cities such as [[Baltimore]], [[Binghamton, New York|Binghamton]], New York, [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], and Washington, D.C., plus many other destinations via transfers.&lt;ref name="hbg_trans"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcrpc-pa.org/SRTP/SRTP_Chapter_02/harrisburg_transport_center.htm |year=2007 |title=About the Harrisburg Transport Center |publisher=Tri-County Regional Planning Commission |accessdate=2007-02-01 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Curbside [[intercity bus service]] is also provided by [[Megabus (North America)|Megabus]] from the parking lot of the [[Harrisburg Mall]] in nearby [[Swatara Township, Dauphin County, Pennsylvania|Swatara Township]], with direct service to Philadelphia, [[State College, Pennsylvania|State College]], and Pittsburgh.

===Regional scheduled line bus service===
The public transit provider in [[York County, Pennsylvania|York County]], [[Rabbit Transit (York)|Rabbit Transit]], operates its RabbitEXPRESS bus service on weekdays between the city of York and both downtown Harrisburg and the main campus for [[Harrisburg Area Community College]]. The commuter-oriented service is designed to serve York County residents who work in Harrisburg, though [[reverse commute]]s are possible under the current schedule. Buses running this route make limited stops in the city of York and at two [[park and ride]]s along [[Interstate 83]] between York and Harrisburg before making various stops in Pennsylvania's capital city. As of May 2007, the RabbitEXPRESS operates three times in the morning and three times in the afternoon.

A charter/tour bus operator, R &amp; J Transport, also provides weekday, scheduled route commuter service for people working in downtown Harrisburg. R &amp; J, which is based in [[Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania|Schuylkill County]], operates two lines, one between [[Frackville, Pennsylvania|Frackville]] and downtown Harrisburg and the other between [[Minersville, Pennsylvania|Minersville]], [[Pine Grove, Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania|Pine Grove]], and downtown Harrisburg.

===Rail===
The [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]'s main line from New York to Chicago passed through Harrisburg. The line was [[electrification|electrified]] in the 1930s, with the wires reaching Harrisburg in 1938. They went no further. Plans to electrify through to [[Pittsburgh]] and thence to Chicago never saw fruition; sufficient funding was never available. Thus, Harrisburg became where the PRR's crack expresses such as the [[Broadway Limited]] changed from electric traction to (originally) a [[steam locomotive]], and later a [[diesel locomotive]]. Harrisburg remained a freight rail hub for PRR's successor [[Conrail]], which was later sold off and divided between [[Norfolk Southern Railway|Norfolk Southern]] and [[CSX]].

====Freight rail====

Norfolk Southern acquired all of Conrail's lines in the Harrisburg area and has continued the city's function as a freight rail hub. Norfolk Southern considers Harrisburg one of many primary hubs in its system, and operates 2 [[intermodal freight transport|intermodal]] (rail/truck transfer) yards in the immediate Harrisburg area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1215/is_7_201/ai_64337963 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080427025012/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1215/is_7_201/ai_64337963 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=April 27, 2008 |title=NS opens intermodal hub at Harrisburg – Norfolk Southern – Brief Article (July 2000) |work=Railway Age |date=July 1, 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Harrisburg Intermodal Yard]] (formerly called Lucknow Yard) is located in the north end of Harrisburg, approximately 3&amp;nbsp;miles north of downtown Harrisburg and the Harrisburg Transport Center, while the [[Rutherford Intermodal Yard]] is located approximately 6&amp;nbsp;miles east of downtown Harrisburg in [[Swatara Township, Dauphin County, Pennsylvania|Swatara Township, Dauphin County]]. Norfolk Southern also operates a significant [[classification yard]] in the Harrisburg area, the [[Enola Yard]], which is located across the Susquehanna River from Harrisburg in [[East Pennsboro Township, Pennsylvania|East Pennsboro Township, Cumberland County]].

====Intercity passenger rail====

[[Amtrak]] provides service to and from Harrisburg. The passenger rail operator runs its ''[[Keystone Service (Amtrak)|Keystone]]'' and ''[[Pennsylvanian (Amtrak)|Pennsylvanian]]'' services between New York, Philadelphia, and the [[Harrisburg Transportation Center]] daily. The ''Pennsylvanian'' route, which operates once daily, continues west to [[Pittsburgh]]. As of April 2007, Amtrak operates 14 weekday roundtrips and 8 weekend roundtrips daily between Harrisburg, [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]], and [[Philadelphia 30th Street Station]]; most of these trains also travel to and from [[New York Penn Station]]. The [[Keystone Corridor]] between Harrisburg and Philadelphia was improved in the mid-first decade of the 21st century, with the primary improvements completed in late 2006. The improvements included upgrading the electrical catenary, installing continuously welded rail, and replacing existing wooden railroad ties with concrete ties. These improvements increased train speeds to 110&amp;nbsp;mph along the corridor and reduced the travel time between Harrisburg and Philadelphia to as little as 95 minutes. It also eliminated the need to change locomotives at 30th Street Station (from diesel to electric and vice versa) for trains continuing to or coming from New York. As of Federal Fiscal Year 2008, the Harrisburg Transportation Center was the 2nd busiest Amtrak station in Pennsylvania and 21st busiest in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.amtrak.com/pdf/factsheets/PENNSYLVANIA08.pdf| year=2008| title=Amtrak Passenger Station Factsheet| publisher=Amtrak| accessdate=2009-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amtrak.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=Amtrak/am2Copy/Title_Image_Copy_Page&amp;c=am2Copy&amp;cid=1081442674300&amp;ssid=542 |year=2008 |title=Amtrak National Facts |publisher=Amtrak |accessdate=2009-04-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120101132/http://www.amtrak.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=Amtrak%2Fam2Copy%2FTitle_Image_Copy_Page&amp;c=am2Copy&amp;cid=1081442674300&amp;ssid=542 |archivedate=2008-01-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bridges===
[[Image:Walnut street br1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Western span of the [[Walnut Street Bridge (Harrisburg)|Walnut Street Bridge]] crossing the [[Susquehanna River]], after it collapsed during the 1996 [[North American blizzard of 1996|flood]].]]
{{See also|List of crossings of the Susquehanna River}}
Harrisburg is the location of over a dozen large bridges, many up to a mile long, that cross the Susquehanna River. Several other important structures span the [[Paxton Creek]] watershed and [[Cameron Street]], linking [[Downtown Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Center City]] with neighborhoods in [[East Harrisburg]]. These include the [[State Street Bridge (Harrisburg, Pennsylvania)|State Street Bridge]], also known as the Soldiers and Sailor's Memorial Bridge, and the [[Mulberry Street Bridge]]. [[Walnut Street Bridge (Harrisburg, Pennsylvania)|Walnut Street Bridge]], now used only by pedestrians and cyclists, links the downtown and [[Riverfront Park (Harrisburg)|Riverfront Park]] areas with [[City Island (Pennsylvania)|City Island]] but goes no further as spans are missing on its western side due to massive flooding resulting from the North American blizzard of 1996.

==Education==

===Public schools===
{{main|Harrisburg School District (Pennsylvania)}}
The City of Harrisburg is served by the [[Harrisburg School District (Pennsylvania)|Harrisburg School District]]. The [[school district]] provides education for the city's youth beginning with all-day [[kindergarten]] through twelfth grade. A multi-year restructuring plan is aimed at making the district a model for urban [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]]. The district has been troubled for decades with management fiascos and low test scores. In the summer of 2007, more than 2,000 city students were enrolled in educational programs offered by the Harrisburg School District as remediation.&lt;ref&gt;Patton, Judith, "Summer schools draw 2,000 Harrisburg students", PennLive, July 24, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The District has been among the lowest ranking districts for academics in the Commonwealth, ranking 492nd out of 496 district ranked by the [[Pittsburgh Business Times]], in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/pittsburgh/print-edition/2014/04/11/school-guide-offers-vital-insights.html |title=School guide offers vital insights |author=Ethan Lott |publisher=Pittsburgh Business Times |date=April 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, several of the Harrisburg School District's school have been listed on the lowest 15% achievement list each year since 2011. This designation means the students qualify for the State's Opportunity Scholarship program. Scholarships, funded by businesses, are available to attend another public school district or a private school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newpa.com/find-incentives-apply-for-funding/ostc-faq |title=Opportunity Scholarship Tax Credit Program FAQ |author=Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development |date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/school_services_office/9153/p/1202312 |title=Opportunity Scholarship Tax Credit Program |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |date=April 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One school in the Harrisburg School District has had consistently adequate academic achievement, Math Science Academy serves pupils grades 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paschoolperformance.org/Profile/5658 |title=Math Science Academy |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |date=November 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, [[SciTech High]], a regional math and science magnet school (affiliated with [[Harrisburg University of Science and Technology|Harrisburg University]]), opened its doors to local students.

;Public Charter Schools:
The city also has several public [[charter school]]s: [[Infinity Charter School]], [[Sylvan Heights Science Charter School]], [[Premier Arts and Science Charter School]] and [[Capital Area School for the Arts]].  A growing number of statewide, virtual, public charter schools provide residents with many alternatives to the bricks and mortar public school system. The cyber charter school [[Commonwealth Connections Academy Cyber School]] is headquartered in Harrisburg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paschoolperformance.org/Profile/7144 |title=Commonwealth Connections Academy Cyber School Fast Facts 2014 |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |date=November 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Central Dauphin School District]], the largest public school district in the [[Harrisburg metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] and the 13th largest in Pennsylvania, has several Harrisburg postal addresses for many of the District's schools. [[Steelton-Highspire School District]] borders much of the Harrisburg School District.

===Private schools===
Harrisburg is home to an extensive Catholic educational system. There are nearly 40 parish-driven elementary schools and seven Catholic high schools within the region administered by the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Harrisburg]], including [[Bishop McDevitt High School (Harrisburg, Pennsylvania)|Bishop McDevitt High School]] and [[Trinity High School (Camp Hill, Pennsylvania)|Trinity High School]]. Numerous other private schools, such as The Londonderry School and [[The Circle School]], which is a [[Sudbury Valley School|Sudbury Model]] school, also operate in Harrisburg. [[Harrisburg Academy]], founded in 1784, is one of the oldest independent [[college preparatory]] schools in the nation. The Rabbi David L. Silver Yeshiva Academy, founded in 1944, is a progressive, modern Jewish day school. Also, Harrisburg is home to [[Harrisburg Christian School]], founded in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hcs.nu/about/history.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070305223551/http://www.hcs.nu/about/history.aspx |archivedate=2007-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable people==

Since the early 18th century, Harrisburg has been home to many people of note. Because it is the seat of government for the state and lies relatively close to other urban centers, Harrisburg has played a significant role in the nation's political, cultural and industrial history. "Harrisburgers" have also taken a leading role in the development of Pennsylvania's history for over two centuries. Two former U.S. Secretaries of War, [[Simon Cameron]] and [[Alexander Ramsey]] and several other prominent political figures, such as former speaker of the house [[Newt Gingrich]], hail from Harrisburg. The actor [[Don Keefer]] was born near Harrisburg, along with the actor [[Richard Sanders (actor)|Richard Sanders]], most famous for playing [[Les Nessman]] in ''[[WKRP in Cincinnati]]''.

'''Iain Tyrrell Benson''' (born 1955 in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]]) is a legal philosopher, writer, professor and practising legal consultant. The main focus of his work in relation to law and society has been to examine some of the various meanings that underlie terms of common but confused usage. His work towards an understanding of ''secular'' and ''[[secularism]]'' has been cited by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]]&lt;ref name=chamberlain&gt;{{cite web|title=Judgments of the Supreme Court of Canada: Chamberlain v.

==Biography==
Iain Benson is the eldest of three children born to Kenneth and Margaret (née Scott) Benson, and was raised primarily in [[Victoria, B.C.]]. The family moved from Edinburgh to [[Quesnel, British Columbia]], and then to [[Prince George, B.C.]], where Kenneth Benson worked as a ''Medical Health Officer'' and was later appointed Assistant Deputy Minister of Health for the government of British Columbia.

Benson|url=http://www.millerthomson.com/en/our-people/iain-t-benson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Benson was appointed to the executive committee of the Foundation Board of the [[Global Centre for Pluralism]] in Ottawa and became a Member of the [[Law Society of Upper Canada]].

==Activities==
Benson carries out written and research work, international lectures, government and private consultation, court appearances before all levels of court in Canada, media interviews and invited academic and government colloquia and panels, in various areas. 
 
In the early twentyfirst century he was one of two non-nationals on the ''Continuation Committee'' drafting the ''South African Charter of Religious Rights and Freedoms''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ismaili Net: Heritage Field:IainTBenson|url=http://ismaili.net/heritage/node/30422}}&lt;/ref&gt; under Section 234 of that country's constitution,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SAIFAC: Biography:Iain Benson|url=http://www.saifac.org.za/staff.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110411021935/http://www.saifac.org.za/staff.htm|archivedate=11 April 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and addressed the ceremony for the public signing of the charter in [[Johannesburg]] in October 2010. Earlier that same year, Iain Benson delivered the keynote paper on religious inclusivity in Canada&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SSRN:Is Canada Moving Towards or Away from Religious Inclusivity in the Public Sphere?|ssrn=1654365}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[Canadian Embassy]] to the [[Holy See]], and discussed the issues of accommodation of religion in the public sphere to the ''Centre for Cultures and Languages'' in Africa.
 
Benson works in the field of ethics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conscience Laws:Ethical Commentaries|url=http://www.consciencelaws.org/issues-ethical01.html|work=The Protection of Conscience Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[constitutional law]] through his involvement with the ''South African Institute for Advanced Constitutional, Human Rights, Public and International Law'', ''The Chester Ronning Centre'' in Alberta, Canada and as Professor Extraordinary in the ''Faculty of Law, Department of Constitutional Law and Philosophy of Law'' at the [[University of the Free State]]. In 2008 he was an invited panel respondent to Dr. Margaret Somerville's ''"Ethics on a Wire"'' Keynote Address at the ''Congress of the Humanities and Social Sciences of Canada''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gerrie|first=James B|title=Newsletter:Fall 2008:Editorial:CANADIAN SOCIETY OF CHRISTIAN PHILOSOPHERS|url=http://cscpscpc.webring.com/PRODUCTS/newsletterf08.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2009 addressed the American Political Science Association hosted by the [[American Public Philosophy Institute]] with a lecture entitled ''"Standing Freedom on its Head: "Equality" and "Non-discrimination" and the Suppression of Democratic Liberties: Law, Liberty and Convergence"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American Political Science Association: 2009 Annual Meeting Programme|url=http://www.apsanet.org/mtgs/program_2009/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2007 Benson was invited to submit a proposal to the Canadian Federal Government Policy Research Initiative on ''"Religion and Public Policy"''.  He wrote a background "think-piece" on religion and public policy in Canada entitled ''"Taking a Fresh Look at Religion and Public Policy in Canada: The Need for a Paradigm Shift"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Taking a Fresh Look at Religion and Public Policy in Canada: The Need for a Paradigm Shift|ssrn=1654422|work=Presentation to the Religion in Public Policy Project, Policy Research Initiative, Federal Government, Canada, January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also appeared before several Canadian government bodies, including the [[Royal Commission]]s on ''Education and New Reproductive Technologies'' and the Law Reform Commission formed to examine abortion. He has appeared before the ''Senate Special Committee'' on ''[[Euthanasia]] and [[Assisted Suicide]]'', the ''Senate Committee'' on ''Banking and Finance'' (re: Pension Reform) and numerous [[House of Commons of Canada]] Committees.

Benson has been interviewed on [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] programs including "Ideas", "Tapestry", "Cross-country Check-up" and "Commentary". He has been interviewed on [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]], Vatican Radio, [[Reuters]] and various radio stations in England and South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Newman Centre: Reasonable Accommodation Panel: Biography: Iain Benson|url=http://www.newmancentre.org/pages/rationaltheism_files/Reasonable_Accommodation.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benson has acted as external reader of manuscripts for various presses and journals including [[McGill-Queen's University Press]](Montreal), [[University of Toronto Press]](Toronto), [[Queen's Law Journal]] (Kingston, Ontario), ''The Journal of Religion, State and Society''([[Routledge]], UK) and the ''South African Journal of Human Rights'', [[Acta Theologica]](South Africa).

Benson continues to lecture across Canada, the United States, Europe, [[Saudi Arabia]] and South Africa, giving papers on topics ranging from, constitutional law and religion, literature, the nature of the "secular", "secularism", "pluralism", and issues related to ethics and the accommodation of differing beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canadian Constitution Foundation:2009 Annual Law Conference Speakers|url=http://www.canadianconstitutionfoundation.ca/confspkrs.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal philosophy and political theory===
Benson has published work on the accommodation of religious and non-religious rights, and has worked to promote the idea of shared civic virtues serving the common good across all belief communities. His published opinion is that all citizens have faith and belief in something, whether these beliefs are grounded in religion or not, and that the public sphere is obliged to act with balance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Social Science Research Network: Papers by Iain T Benson; search for Iain Benson|url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/DisplayAbstractSearch.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benson's "Notes Towards a (Re)Definition of the 'Secular'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Benson|first=Iain T|journal=University of British Columbia Law Review|year=2000|volume=33|pages=520|ssrn=1654455}}&lt;/ref&gt; was cited by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] (in its landmark 2002 ''Chamberlain'' decision&lt;ref name=chamberlain/&gt;). This case concerned whether books on same-sex parented families should be approved at kindergarten grade. In their decision to refer the matter back for a non-discriminatory decision, the court said that ''the B.C. School Act's insistence on secularism and non-discrimination lies at the heart of this case.  [It] provides that  "[a]ll schools and Provincial schools must be conducted on strictly secular and non-sectarian principles".  It also emphasises that "[t]he highest morality must be inculcated, but no religious dogma or creed is to be taught in a school or Provincial school"''. The decision cites Benson's article in connection with proper understanding of the concepts of "secular" and "non-sectarian", and says that it is an error to equate"secular" with "non-religious". In subsequent writing, Benson has been critical of the court's apparent adoption of "secularism" as the matter was never argued before them and was not essential to the statutory interpretation before them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Benson|first=Iain T.|title="Considering Secularism" in "Recognizing Religion in a Secular Society"|year=2004|publisher=McGill-Queen's|location=Montreal|isbn=0-7735-2812-1|pages=83–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SSRN: Considering Secularism|ssrn=1654427|work=RECOGNIZING RELIGION IN A SECULAR SOCIETY|publisher=McGill-Queens Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work was cited with approval by Justice Albie Sachs in the 2005 decision of the [[South African Constitutional Court]] in the ''Fourie'' decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SAFII: Constitutional Court Decisions: Fourie Decision|url=http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/2005/19.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benson has also criticised a failure to examine the meaning of "secularism" in the works of most commentators on the "secular" and "secularism" itself, including the work of Charles Taylor. He has been critical of the tendency to assume that "secularism" is a neutral concept, when the origin of the term was within a framework that expressly intended to minimise any public relevance for religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Benson|first=Iain T.|title="That False Struggle between Believers and Non-Believers"; "Le faux combat entre croyants et non-croyants"; "Quella falsa lotta tra credenti e non-credenti"|journal=Oasis, Marcianum Press|date=December 2011|volume=Year 6|series=English, French, Italian, English-Urdu and English-Arabic editions|issue=12|pages=22–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benson has argued that the Canadian approach to a pluralistic society has often overlooked the important role that religions play in the public sphere as well as in the lives of citizens and their groups. He contends that secularism is not neutral regarding religion, and that the term as most people have understood it excludes from "the public sphere" a key component of many citizens' identities, which is their freedom of conscience and religion. Benson further argues that a better understanding of the term "secular" would keep religion and the state jurisdictionally separate while allowing for co-operation and mutual understanding between them. The ultimate goal of this preferred philosophy would be to create a society in which individual and communal differences are accepted and embraced rather than one in which law and politics are viewed as building towards forced "agreement" or "convergence". A "think-piece" paper for the Canadian Federal Government's ''Policy Research Initiative'' group on ''"Religion and Public Policy"'' (January 2008) was an elaboration of some of his thinking on the issue and highlighted the need for a [[paradigm shift]] in the way we approach religion and [[public policy]]. It also outlined some of the implications this should have for government actions in relation to [[multiculturalism]] in the public sphere, and legal decisions in relation to religious freedom and the principles of accommodation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Benson|first=Iain|title=Taking a Fresh Look at Religion and Public Policy in Canada: The Need for a Paradigm Shift|ssrn=1654422|work=Presentation to the Religion in Public Policy Project, Policy Research Initiative, Federal Government, Canada, January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently he has begun examining the tendency of legal decisions to remove from consideration the communal dimension of religious rights, and has written of the associational dimension of the freedom of religion and its importance to diversity, freedom and a pluralistic society.;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Benson|first=Iain T|title=The Case for Religious Inclusivism and the Judicial Recognition of Associational Rights: A Response to Lenta|ssrn=1654410|publisher=Constitutional Court Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{UStaxation}}
An '''independent contractor''' is a [[natural person]], [[business]], or [[corporation]] that provides [[good (accounting)|goods]] or [[Service (economics)|services]] to another entity under terms specified in a [[contract]] or within a [[oral contract|verbal agreement]]. Unlike an [[employment#Employee|employee]], an independent contractor does not work regularly for an [[employer]] but works as and when required, during which time he or she may be subject to [[law of agency]]. Independent contractors are usually paid on a [[freelance]] basis. Contractors often work through a [[limited company]] or [[Franchising|franchise]], which they themselves own, or may work through an [[umbrella company]].

In the United States, any company or organization engaged in a trade or business that pays more than $600 to an independent contractor in one year is required to [[Tax information reporting|report]] this to the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) as well as to the contractor, using [[Form 1099-MISC]].&lt;ref&gt;See generally {{usc|26|6041}} and 26 C.F.R. sec. 1.6041-1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1099msc.pdf Sample form 1099-MISC]&lt;/ref&gt; This form is merely a report of the money paid; independent contractors do not have income taxes withheld like regular employees.

==Versus employee ==
{{Main|Misclassification of employees as independent contractors}}
The distinction between independent contractor and employee is an important one in the United States, as the costs for business owners to maintain employees are significantly higher than the costs associated with hiring independent contractors, due to federal and state requirements for employers to pay FICA ([[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] taxes) and [[Federal Unemployment Tax Act|unemployment]] taxes on received income for employees.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;  Likewise, employees are protected from being fired without cause, and if fired or let go for other reasons are entitled to unemployment benefits, whereas independent contractors have neither protection nor entitlement. Employees are also entitled to receive [[overtime]] pay for work performed over the 40-hour-per-week standard, whereas independent contractors may work any number of hours (including far above this standard) with no change in pay.

In the early 1990s, the IRS methodically began to look for employers who were misclassifying employees as independent contractors, and has since obtained billions of dollars in [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] [[back taxes]].&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book|last = Brabec|first= Barbara|authorlink=|title=How to Maximize Schedule C Deductions &amp; Cut Self-Employment Taxes to the BONE -|publisher=Barbara Brabec Productions |date=November 26, 2014 |location=| pages=107|isbn= 978-0985633318|doi=|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, worker classification initiatives have been a top priority for the IRS, the Department of Labor, and state agencies. In 2011, the IRS and the Department of Labor entered into a [[memorandum of understanding]] in an effort to jointly increase worker misclassification audits.&lt;ref name="The National Law Review"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Koch|first1=Matthew|title=The Tax Risks of Misclassifying Employees|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/tax-risks-misclassifying-employees|accessdate=June 14, 2014|work=The National Law Review|publisher=McBrayer, McGinnis, Leslie and Kirkland, PLLC|date=June 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Supreme Court]] has offered the following guidelines to distinguish employees from independent contractors:

{{Ordered list |The extent to which services are integral to the employer's business. Greater integration favors an employee-employer relationship. |The permanence of the relationship. More established relationships favor employee status.|The amount of investment in equipment. When a worker makes a significant investment in the equipment they use in working for someone else, this suggests an independent contractor relationship.|The degree of control by the principal. More control favors employee-employer status.|The amount of financial risk. More opportunity for profit or loss favors an independent contractor relationship.|The amount of initiative, judgment or foresight in open-market competition with others required for the success of the claimed independent enterprise. Entrepreneurial and distinctive work favors an independent contractor relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/financial-control|title=Financial Control|date=September 13, 2017|publisher=IRS|accessdate=October 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The IRS, for federal income tax, applies a "right to control test" which considers the nature of the working relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McConville|first1=Timothy M.|title=Don't Misclassify Workers as Independent Contractors|journal=The National Law Review|date=May 20, 2014|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/don-t-misclassify-workers-independent-contractors|accessdate=June 14, 2014|publisher=Odin, Feldman &amp; Pittleman, P.C.|issn=2161-3362}}&lt;/ref&gt; They highlight three general aspects of the employment arrangement:

#financial control 
#behavioral control
#relationship between the parties

In general, their criteria parallel those of the Supreme Court in sentiment. They include guidelines such as the amount of instruction, training, integration, use of assistants, length of professional relationship, regularity of work, location of work, payment schedule, source of funds for business expenditures, right to quit, and financial risk more typically seen with each work category. In their framework, independent contractors retain control over schedule and hours worked, jobs accepted, and performance monitoring. They also can have a major investment in equipment, furnish their own supplies, provide their own insurance, repairs, and other expenses related to their business. They may also perform a unique service that is not in the normal course of business of the employer. This contrasts with employees, who usually work at the schedule required by the employer, and whose performance the employer directly supervises. Independent contractors can also work for multiple firms, and offer their services to the general public.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;

The distinction between independent contractors and employees is not always clear, and continues to evolve. For example, some independent contractors may work for a number of different organizations throughout the year, while others retain independent contractor status although they work for the same organization the entire year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/faqs/faq-kw5.html IRS Frequently Asked Questions about form 1099-MISC]&lt;/ref&gt; Other companies, for example in the freight transport industry, specify the schedule for the independent contractor, require purchase of vehicles from the company and prohibit work for other companies.&lt;ref name="The National Law Review"/&gt;

In July 2015, the U.S. Department of Labor issued new guidelines on the misclassification of employees as independent contractors. "A worker who is economically dependent on an employer is suffered or permitted to work by the employer. Thus, applying the economic realities test in view of the expansive definition of "employ" under the Act, most workers are employees under the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]]."&lt;ref name=Weil&gt;{{cite web

{{quote|... the economic realities of the relationship, and not the label an employer gives it, are determinative. Thus, an agreement between an employer and a worker designating or labeling the worker as an independent contractor is not indicative of the economic realities of the working relationship and is not relevant to the analysis of the worker's status.&lt;ref name = Weil /&gt;}}

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
Independent contracting has both benefits and drawbacks to contractors.

===Advantages===
* Since they are rarely tied to an employer, they are free to set their own rules of business, limited only by [[bargaining power]].
* Since they usually develop a large network of clients, the loss of one or two often has a negligible effect.
* Many people simply like the idea of "[[Self-employment|being your own boss]]." Aside from materialistic benefits, many people simply enjoy not having to answer to a supervisor.
* As an artist/author of any tangible artwork, such as paintings, sculptures, photographs, or written works, a person is entitled to exclusive copyright ownership if they created the work as an independent contractor. If the person created such works while in the employ of another person or corporation, the rights belong to the employer (under most standard employment contracts).

Firms in the [[sharing economy]] such as [[Uber]] can gain substantial advantages via the [[misclassification of employees as independent contractors]].&lt;ref name=Medium42015&gt;{{cite news|author1=Lauren Smiley|title=What Strippers Can Teach Uber|url=https://medium.com/matter/what-strippers-can-teach-uber-1f5b15e5b427|accessdate=April 21, 2015|issue=Medium.com|date=April 20, 2015|quote=Many of these companies are built with workers who are not even considered workers at all. In a twist of business logic that drives much of the sharing economy, these delivery people, drivers, and maids aren't employees – they're entrepreneurs.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disadvantages===
* In the United States, an [[Internal Revenue Service]] computer algorithm matches individuals with [[Form 1099]]s to the company that pays them. If an independent contractor reports more than $10,000 of earnings, or majority of income from a single source, the IRS is likely to question the independence of the worker, and investigate the company that issued the Form 1099.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt; 
* Employer [[misclassification of employees as independent contractors]] either inadvertently or to avoid taxation and regulation, is widespread.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/18/business/18workers.html "U.S. Cracks Down on ‘Contractors' as a Tax Dodge"] article by Steven Greenhouse in ''[[The New York Times]]'' February 17, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, contractorization has been used as an indirect form of [[union-busting]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/2012/04/25/taxes_for_union_busting/ Salon - Taxes for union busting]&lt;/ref&gt;
* An independent contractor can itself be a business with employees; however, in most cases in the United States independent contractors operate as a [[sole proprietorship]] or single-member [[limited liability company]]. This means the independent contractor, as a business owner, incurs its own expenses to provide the contracted service, must acquire its own equipment to perform the service, and is responsible for business filings such as income tax returns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/124016/truck-drivers-to-lose-jobs Radio New Zealand - Truck drivers to lose jobs]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Independent contractors are responsible for their own [[Self-employment|self-employment tax]], which consists of both halves of the FICA tax amount.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.medlawplus.com/library/legal/definitions/fica.htm definition of FICA Tax] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112124926/http://www.medlawplus.com/library/legal/definitions/fica.htm |date=January 12, 2012 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  An employee only pays the employee portion of the FICA tax.  Self-employment taxes are not withheld from the earnings of independent contractors who are required to voluntarily declare and pay [https://www.irs.gov/publications/p505/ch02.html estimated earnings taxes] to the IRS, which can lead to a trap for contractors who run into financial difficulty and become tempted to put off making the required estimated tax payments.
* There are several monetary incentives that are guaranteed to employees in the [[United States]], but not independent contractors.  Examples include [[worker's compensation]] and [[unemployment insurance]]; however, independent contractors are allowed to make [[Individual Retirement Account]] contributions.
* In many jurisdictions, [[occupational safety and health]] regulations are less comprehensive for independent contractors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.times-standard.com/localnews/ci_20077560 Times-Standard - Logger deaths highlight safety concerns; contractors exempt from state guidelines]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Independent contracting in tort==
The employer of an independent contractor is generally not held [[vicariously liable]] for the [[tort]]ious acts and omissions of the contractor, because the control and supervision found in an employer–employee or principal–agent relationship is lacking. However, vicarious liability will be imposed in some circumstances:
#where the contractor injures an [[invitee]] to the [[real property]] of the employer, 
#the contractor is involved in an ultra-hazardous activity (one likely to cause substantial injury, such as blasting with explosives), or
#the employer is [[estoppel|estopped]] from denying liability because he has held out the independent contractor as if he were simply an employee or agent.
#the employer is involved in an operation subject to obligations imposed by a public authority

==Alternatives==
Due to the higher expense of maintaining employees, many employers needing to transition from independent contractors to employees may find the switch difficult. There is a transitional status for employees as an alternative to independent contracting known as being a [[statutory employee]]. Statutory employees are less expensive to hire than classic employees because the employer does not have to pay unemployment tax. However, they are more expensive than independent contractors because [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] taxes must be paid on wages. Similarly to independent contractors, statutory employees can deduct their trade or business expenses from their W2 earnings.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;

===Dependent contractor===
A growing number of workers do not neatly fit the government's categorizations of independent contractors and statutory employees, and are increasingly being classified as dependent contractors. Some of these contingent workforce—independent contractors, temporary workers, and part-time workers, who work when and for how long they want, such as those who work for such companies as [[Uber]], Handybook, Inc., and [[CrowdFlower]]—have filed lawsuits that argue that companies that substantially control workers' work and behaviors while working (such as at Handybook, Inc.: when to knock on customers' doors vs. ring the doorbells, and how to use the customers' bathrooms) should be covered by minimum-wage and overtime rules under the Fair Labor Standards Act, as well as receive other traditional employee protections. Wilma Liebman, former chairperson of the National Labor Relations Board, has observed that Canada and Germany have such protections in place for contingent workers. And UK Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] has appointed an overseer for freelance workers in that country, to determine how the government should support freelance workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Dependent Contractor?|url=https://aseonline.org/ArticleDetailsPage/tabid/7442/ArticleID/1112/The-Dependent-Contractor.aspx|author=DeSantis, Joe |date=   February 4, 2015 | website=American Society of Employers}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Wall Street Journal|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-if-there-were-a-new-type-of-worker-dependent-contractor-1422405831|title=What if There Were a New Type of Worker?

{{Fiqh}}
'''Islamic military jurisprudence''' refers to what has been accepted in [[Sharia]] (Islamic law) and [[Fiqh]] (Islamic jurisprudence) by ''[[Ulama]]'' (Islamic scholars) as the correct [[Islam]]ic manner which is expected to be obeyed by [[Muslim]]s in times of war. Some scholars and Muslim religious figures claim that armed struggle based on Islamic principles is referred to as the [[Lesser jihad]].

==Development of rulings==
{{see also|Jihad|List of battles of Muhammad|Muhammad as a diplomat}}
The first military rulings were formulated during the first century after Muhammad [[Hijra (Islam)|established an Islamic state in Medina]]. These rulings evolved in accordance with the interpretations of the [[Qur'an]] (the Islamic Holy scriptures) and [[Hadith]] (the recorded traditions, actions (behaviors), sayings and consents of Muhammad). The key themes in these rulings were the [[Justice|justness]] of war (Harb), and the injunction to jihad. The rulings do not cover [[feud]]s and armed conflicts in general.&lt;ref name="Enein"&gt;Aboul-Enein and Zuhur (2004), pp. 3–4&lt;/ref&gt;

Jihad (Arabic for "struggle") was given a military dimension after the oppressive practices of the [[Mecca]]n [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraish]] against Muslims. It was interpreted as the struggle in [[Allah|God]]'s cause to be conducted by the [[Ummah|Muslim community]]. Injunctions relating to jihad have been characterized as individual as well as collective duties of the [[Ummah|Muslim community]]. Hence, the nature of attack is important in the interpretation—if the Muslim community as a whole is attacked jihad becomes incumbent on all Muslims. Jihad is differentiated further in respect to the requirements within Muslim-governed lands ([[Divisions of the world in Islam#Dar al-Islam .28House of Islam.29|Dar al-Islam]]) and non-Muslim lands ([[Divisions of the world in Islam#Dar al-Harb .28House of war.29|Dar al-Harb]]).&lt;ref name="Enein"/&gt;

According to Shaheen Sardar Ali and Javaid Rehman, both professors of law, the Islamic military jurisprudence are in line with rules of modern international law. They point to the dual commitment of [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] (OIC) member states (representing most of the [[Muslim world]]) to Islamic law and the United Nations Charter, as evidence of compatibility of both legal systems.&lt;ref name="rehman"&gt;Ali, Shaheen Sardar; Rehman, Javaid. (Winter, 2005) "The Concept of Jihad in Islamic International Law". ''Journal of Conflict &amp; Security Law''. '''10''' (3) pp. 321–43.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics of warfare==
{{see also|Islamic ethics}}

Fighting is justified for legitimate self-defense, to aid other Muslims and after a violation in the terms of a treaty, but should be stopped if these circumstances cease to exist.&lt;ref name="Crone"&gt;Patricia Crone, ''[[Encyclopedia of the Qur'an]]'', War article, p. 456. [[Brill Publishers]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Micheline R. Ishay, ''The History of Human Rights: From Ancient Times to the Globalization Era'', [[University of California Press]], p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boundries_Princeton"&gt;Sohail H. Hashmi, David Miller, ''Boundaries and Justice: diverse ethical perspectives'', [[Princeton University Press]], p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Douglas M. Johnston, ''Faith-Based Diplomacy: Trumping Realpolitik'', [[Oxford University Press]], p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of forgiveness is reiterated in between the assertions of the right to [[self-defense]].&lt;ref name="Crone"/&gt;

During his life, Muhammad gave various injunctions to his forces and adopted practices toward the conduct of war. The most important of these were summarized by Muhammad's companion and first [[Caliph]], [[Abu Bakr]], in the form of ten rules for the [[Rashidun army|Muslim army]]:&lt;ref name=Zuhur&gt;Aboul-Enein, H. Yousuf and Zuhur, Sherifa, ''Islamic Rulings on Warfare'', p. 22, Strategic Studies Institute, US Army War College, Diane Publishing Co., Darby PA, {{ISBN|1-4289-1039-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|O people!  I charge you with ten rules; learn them well!

Stop, O people, that I may give you ten rules for your guidance in the battlefield. Do not commit treachery or deviate from the right path. You must not mutilate dead bodies. Neither kill a child, nor a woman, nor an aged man. Bring no harm to the trees, nor burn them with fire, especially those which are fruitful. Slay not any of the enemy's flock, save for your food. You are likely to pass by people who have devoted their lives to monastic services; leave them alone.&lt;ref name=Zuhur/&gt;}}

According to [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|Tabari]], the ten bits of "advice" that Abu Bakr gave was during the [[Expedition of Usama bin Zayd]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The conquest of Arabia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VA5Uke7IpHkC&amp;pg=PA16|first=Al|last=Tabari|year=1993|publisher=State University of New York Press

{{quote|You are going to enter Egypt a land where ''qirat'' (money unit) is used. Be extremely good to them as they have with us close ties and marriage relationships. When you enter Egypt after my death, recruit many soldiers from among the Egyptians because they are the best soldiers on earth, as they and their wives are permanently on duty until the Day of Resurrection. Be good to the Copts of Egypt; you shall take them over, but they shall be your instrument and help. Be Righteous to God about the Copts.}}

These principles were upheld by [['Amr ibn al-'As]] during his conquest of Egypt. A Christian contemporary in the 7th century, [[John of Nikiû]], stated the following regarding the conquest of [[Alexandria]] by 'Amr:

{{quote|On the twentieth of Maskaram, Theodore and all his troops and officers set out and proceeded to the island of Cyprus, and abandoned the city of Alexandria. And thereupon 'Amr the chief of the Moslem made his entry without effort into the city of Alexandria. And the inhabitants received him with respect; for they were in great tribulation and affliction. And Abba Benjamin, the patriarch of the Egyptians, returned to the city of Alexandria in the thirteenth year after his flight from the Romans, and he went to the Churches, and inspected all of them. And every one said: 'This expulsion (of the Romans) and victory of the Moslem is due to the wickedness of the emperor Heraclius and his persecution of the Orthodox through the patriarch Cyrus. This was the cause of the ruin of the Romans and the subjugation of Egypt by the Moslem. And 'Amr became stronger every day in every field of his activity. And he exacted the taxes which had been determined upon, but he took none of the property of the Churches, and he committed no act of spoliation or plunder, and he preserved them throughout all his days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[John of Nikiû]]|title=Chronicle|chapter=CXX.72-CXXI.3|year=7th century|url=http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/nikiu2_chronicle.htm|accessdate=2010-03-31|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The principles established by the early Caliphs were also honoured during the [[Crusades]], as exemplified by [[Sultan]]s such as [[Saladin]] and [[Al-Kamil]]. For example, after Al-Kamil defeated the [[Franks]] during the [[Crusades]], Oliverus Scholasticus praised the Islamic [[laws of war]], commenting on how Al-Kamil supplied the defeated Frankish army with food:&lt;ref name=Weeramantry&gt;{{Cite book|title=Justice Without Frontiers|first=Christopher G.|last=Judge Weeramantry|year=1997|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|isbn=90-411-0241-8|page=136|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Who could doubt that such goodness, friendship and charity come from God? Men whose parents, sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, had died in agony at our hands, whose lands we took, whom we drove naked from their homes, revived us with their own food when we were dying of hunger and showered us with kindness even when we were in their power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Justice Without Frontiers|first=Christopher G.|last=Judge Weeramantry|year=1997|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|isbn=90-411-0241-8|pages=136–37|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The early Islamic treatises on [[international law]] from the 9th century onwards covered the application of [[Islamic ethics]], [[Islamic economic jurisprudence]] and Islamic military jurisprudence to international law,&lt;ref name=Kelsay&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Al-Shaybani and the Islamic Law of War|last=Kelsay|first=J.|journal=Journal of Military Ethics|volume=2|issue=1|date=March 2003|publisher=[[Routledge]]|pages=63–75|doi=10.1080/15027570310000027|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were concerned with a number of modern international law topics, including the [[law of treaties]]; the treatment of [[diplomat]]s, [[hostage]]s, [[refugee]]s and [[prisoners of war]]; the [[right of asylum]]; [[Laws of war|conduct on the battlefield]]; protection of women, children and [[non-combatant]] [[civilian]]s; [[contract]]s across the lines of battle; the use of poisonous weapons; and devastation of enemy territory.&lt;ref name=Weeramantry /&gt;

==Criteria for soldiering==
Muslim jurists agree that Muslim armed forces must consist of debt-free adults who possess a sound mind and body. In addition, the combatants must not be [[Conscription|conscripted]], but rather enlist of their free will, and with the permission of their family.&lt;ref name = Enein12&gt;Aboul-Enein and Zuhur, pp. 12-13&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legitimacy of war==
{{see also|Defensive jihad|Offensive jihad}}
Muslims have struggled to differentiate between legitimate and illegitimate wars. Fighting in self-defense is not only legitimate but considered obligatory upon Muslims, according to the Qur'an. The Qur'an, however, says that should the enemy's hostile behavior cease, then the reason for engaging the enemy also lapses.&lt;ref name =afsaruddin&gt;Afsaruddin, Asma (2007). ''Views of Jihad Throughout History''. Religion Compass 1 (1), pp. 165–69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars{{Who|date=December 2015}} argue that war may only be legitimate if Muslims have at least half the power of the enemy (and thus capable of winning it). Other [[Islamic scholar]]s consider this command only for a particular time.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi]], [[Tafhim al-Qur'an]].[http://www.translatedquran.com/meaning.asp?sno=8&amp;tno=253] {{webarchive |url=https://archive.is/20120913034315/http://www.translatedquran.com/meaning.asp?sno=8&amp;tno=253 |date=September 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defensive conflict===
According to the majority of jurists, the Qur'anic ''[[casus belli]]'' (justification of war) are restricted to aggression against Muslims and ''fitna''—persecution of Muslims because of their religious belief.&lt;ref name="Al-Dawoody"&gt;Ahmed Al-Dawoody (2011), ''The Islamic Law of War: Justifications and Regulations'', pp. 78–9. Palgrave Macmillan. {{ISBN|9780230111608}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They hold that unbelief in itself is not the justification for war. These jurists therefore maintain that only combatants are to be fought; noncombatants such as women, children, clergy, the aged, the insane, farmers, serfs, the blind, and so on are not to be killed in war.&lt;ref name="Al-Dawoody"/&gt; Thus, the Hanafī Ibn Najīm states: "the reason for jihād in our [the Hanafīs] view is ''kawnuhum harbā ‛alaynā'' [literally, their being at war against us]."&lt;ref name="Al-Dawoody"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Najīm, ''Al-Bahr al-Rā’iq'', Vol. 5, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; The Hanafī jurists al-Shaybānī and al-Sarakhsī state that "although kufr [unbelief in God] is one of the greatest sins, it is between the individual and his God the Almighty and the punishment for this sin is to be postponed to the ''dār al-jazā’'', (the abode of reckoning, the Hereafter)."&lt;ref name="Al-Dawoody"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Khaled Abou El Fadl]], ''The Rules of Killing at War: An Inquiry into Classical Sources'', p. 152. The Muslim World. Volume 89, Issue 2, April 1999. doi: 10.1111/j.1478-1913.1999.tb03675.x&lt;/ref&gt; War, according to the Hanafis, can't simply be made on the account of a nation's religion.&lt;ref name =afsaruddin/&gt; [[Abdulaziz Sachedina]] argues that the original jihad according to his version of Shi'ism was permission to fight back against those who broke their pledges. Thus the Qur'an justified defensive jihad by allowing Muslims to fight back against hostile and dangerous forces.&lt;ref name = sachedina/&gt;

===Offensive conflict===
[[Muhammad ibn Idris ash-Shafi`i]] (d. 820), founder of the [[Shafi'i]] school of thought, was the first to permit offensive jihad, limiting this warfare against pagan Arabs only, not permitting it against non-Arab non-Muslims.&lt;ref name =afsaruddin/&gt; This view of al-Shafi'i is mitigated by the fact that an opposite view, in agreement with the majority, is also attributed to al-Shafi'i.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = War and Peace in Islam: The Uses and Abuses of Jihad|last = [[Prince Ghazi bin Muhammad|H.R.H.

[[Javed Ahmad Ghamidi]] believes that after [[Muhammad]] and his [[Sahaba|companions]], there is no concept in Islam obliging Muslims to wage war for [[proselytization|propagation]] or implementation of Islam. The only valid basis for military jihad is to end oppression when all other measures have failed. Islam only allows jihad to be conducted by a government.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sahih Bukhari]], 2957, ''A Muslim ruler is the shield [of his people]. An armed struggle can only be carried out under him and people should seek his shelter [in war]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ghamidi, ''[[Mizan]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Misplaced Directives'', [http://www.renaissance.com.pk Renaissance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060813123204/http://www.renaissance.com.pk/ |date=2006-08-13 }}, [[Al-Mawrid|Al-Mawrid Institute]], Vol. 12, No. 3, March 2002.{{cite web |url=http://www.renaissance.com.pk/martitl2y2.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-10-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061115065145/http://www.renaissance.com.pk/martitl2y2.html |archivedate=2006-11-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Abdulaziz Sachedina]], [[offensive jihad]] raises questions about whether jihad is justifiable on moral grounds. He states that the Qur'an requires Muslims to establish just public order, increasing the influence of Islam, allowing public Islamic worship, through offensive measures.  To this end, the Qur'anic verses revealed required Muslims to wage jihad against unbelievers who persecuted them. This has been complicated by the early [[Muslim conquests]], which he argues were although considered jihad by [[Sunni]] scholars, but under close scrutiny can be determined to be political. Moreover, the offensive jihad points more to the complex relationship with the "[[People of the Book|People of the book]]".&lt;ref name = sachedina&gt;{{cite book |title=The Just Ruler In Shi'ite Islam |last=Sachedina |first=Abdulaziz |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1988 |publisher=Oxford University Press US |location= |isbn=0-19-511915-0 |page=106 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some major modern scholars who have rejected the idea of "offensive jihad" include the founder of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], [[Hasan al-Banna]] (1906–1949), the [[Al-Azhar]] scholar [[Muhammad Abu Zahra]] (1898–1974) who thought that "military jihad is permitted only to remove aggression ('udwân) and religious persecution ([[fitna (word)|fitna]]h) against Muslims", as well as Syrian scholars [[Mohamed Said Ramadan Al-Bouti]] (1929–2013) and [[Wahbah al-Zuhayli]] (1932-2015), the latter saying that "peace is the underlying principle of relations between Muslims and non-Muslims. al-Zuhayli maintains that this view is supported by 8:61, as well as 2:208 and 4:94 that establish the principle of international peace. For him, Muslims should be committed to peace and security (on the basis of 4:90 and 60:8)."&lt;ref&gt;ElSayed Amin, ''Reclaiming Jihad: A Qur'anic Critique of Terrorism'', Kube Publishing (2015), pp. 104-106&lt;/ref&gt;

==International conflict==
International conflicts are armed strifes conducted by one state against another, and are distinguished from civil wars or armed strife within a state.&lt;ref name = D&gt;Dāmād (2003), p.261&lt;/ref&gt; Some classical Islamic scholars, like the [[Shafi'i]], classified territories into broad categories: ''dar al-islam'' ("abode of Islam"), ''dar al-harb'' ("abode of war), ''dar al-ahd'' ("abode of treaty"), and ''dar al-sulh'' ("abode of reconciliation"). Such categorizations of states, according to Asma Afsaruddin, are not mentioned in the Qur'an and [[Sunnah|Islamic tradition]].&lt;ref name =afsaruddin/&gt;

===Declaration of war===
The [[Qur'an]] commands Muslims to make a proper declaration of war prior to the commencement of military operations. Thus, surprise [[Military strike|attack]]s are illegal under the Islamic jurisprudence.{{fact|date=January 2017}} The Qur'an had similarly commanded Muhammad to give his enemies, who had violated the [[Treaty of Hudaybiyyah]], a time period of four months to reconsider their position and negotiate.&lt;ref&gt;Maududi (1967), p. 177, vol. 2&lt;/ref&gt; This rule, however, is not binding if the adversary has already started the war.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Maududi (1998), p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; [[Religious persecution|Forcible prevention of religious practice]] is considered an act of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Conduct of armed forces===
During battle the Qur'an commands Muslims to fight against the enemy. However, there are resrictions to such combat. Burning or drowning the enemy is allowed only if it is impossible to achieve victory by other means.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Rudolph|last=Peters| year=2015 | title=Islam and Colonialism: The Doctrine of Jihad in Modern History|publisher=DE GRUYTER MOUTON|url=https://www.degruyter.com/view/product/6260| via = [[De Gruyter]]|subscription=yes|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mutilation of dead bodies is prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;Ghamid (2001), referring to [[Sahih Bukhari]] 3016, and [[Sahih Bukhari]] 2613&lt;/ref&gt; The Qur'an also discourages Muslim combatants from displaying pomp and unnecessary boasting when setting out for battle.&lt;ref&gt;Ghamidi (2001), referring to {{cite quran|8|47|style=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to professor Sayyid Dāmād, no explicit injunctions against use of [[Chemical warfare|chemical]] or [[biological warfare]] were developed by medieval Islamic jurists as these threats were not existent then. However, ''Khalil al-Maliki's Book on jihad'' states that combatants are forbidden to employ weapons that cause unnecessary injury to the enemy, except under dire circumstances. The book, as an example, forbids the use of poisonous spears, since it inflicts unnecessary pain.&lt;ref&gt;Dāmād (2003), p. 266&lt;/ref&gt;

====Civilian areas====
According to all madhhabs, it is not permissible to kill women or children unless they are fighting against the Muslims.&lt;ref name=peters21&gt;{{Cite book |first=Rudolph|last=Peters| year=2015 | title=Islam and Colonialism: The Doctrine of Jihad in Modern History|publisher=DE GRUYTER MOUTON|url=https://www.degruyter.com/view/product/6260| via = [[De Gruyter]]|subscription=yes|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hanafi]], [[Hanbali]], and [[Maliki]] schools forbid killing of those who are not able to fight, including monks, farmers, and serfs, as well as mentally and physically disabled.&lt;ref name=peters21/&gt;
 
Harming civilian areas and pillaging residential areas is also forbidden,&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Maududi (1998), p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; as is the destruction of trees, crops, livestock and farmlands.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[[Ali ibn al-Athir]], ''[[Al-Kamil fi al-Tarikh]]'', Vol. 3, p. 227&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ali (1991), p. 79, quoting {{cite quran|2|190|style=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Muslim forces may not loot travelers, as doing so is contrary to the spirit of [[jihad]].&lt;ref&gt;Ghamidi (2006), refers to [[Sahih Bukhari]] 2629&lt;/ref&gt; Nor do they have the right to use the local facilities of the native people without their consent. If such a consent is obtained, the Muslim army is still under the obligation to compensate the people financially for the use of such facilities. However, Islamic law allows the confiscation of military equipment and supplies captured from the camps and military headquarters of the combatant armies.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ghamidi (2001), refers to a [[hadith]] "plundered [food] is not better than dead meat [forbidden in Islam]" [[Sahih Bukhari]] 2705&lt;/ref&gt;

===Negotiations===
Commentators of the Qur'an agree that Muslims should always be willing and ready to negotiate peace with the other party without any hesitation. According to [[Maududi]], Islam does not permit Muslims to reject peace and continue bloodshed.&lt;ref&gt;Maududi (1967), p. 151–14, vol. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Islamic jurisprudence calls for third party interventions as another means of ending conflicts. Such interventions are to establish mediation between the two parties to achieve a just resolution of the dispute.&lt;ref name = Abu-Nimer&gt;Abu-Nimer(2000-2001), p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ceasefire===
In the context of seventh century [[Arabia]], the Qur'an ordained Muslims must restrain themselves from fighting in the months when fighting was prohibited by Arab [[pagan]]s. The Qur'an also required the respect of this cease-fire, prohibiting its violation.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

If, however, non-Muslims commit acts of aggression, Muslims are free to retaliate, though in a manner that is equal to the original transgression.&lt;ref&gt;Ali (1991), p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; The  "[[sword verse]]", which has attracted attention, is directed against a particular group who violate the terms of peace and commit aggression (but excepts those who observe the treaty). Crone states that this verse seems to be based on the same above-mentioned rules. Here also it is stressed that one must stop when they do.&lt;ref name="Crone"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boundries_Princeton"/&gt; [[Ibn Kathir]] states that the verse implies a hasty mission of besieging and gathering intelligence about the enemy, resulting in either death or repentance by the enemy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tafsir.com/default.asp?sid=9&amp;tid=20750 This is the Ayah of the Sword] by [[Ibn Kathir]]&lt;/ref&gt; It is read as a continuation of previous verses, it would be concerned with the same oath-breaking of "polytheists".&lt;ref name="Crone"/&gt;

===Prisoners of War===
{{main|Prisoners of war in Islam}}
{{see also|Islamic views on slavery}}

Men, women, and children may all be taken as prisoners of war under traditional interpretations of Islamic law. Generally, a prisoner of war could be, at the discretion of the military leader, executed, freed, ransomed, exchanged for Muslim prisoners,&lt;ref&gt;[[Tafsir]] of the [[Qur'an]] by [[Ibn Kathir]] [http://users.mo-net.com/mcruzan/pows_02.htm#study1a]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eois"&gt;Brunschvig. 'Abd; Encyclopedia of Islam&lt;/ref&gt; or kept as slaves. In earlier times, the ransom sometimes took an educational dimension, where a literate prisoner of war could secure his or her freedom by teaching ten Muslims to read and write.&lt;ref&gt;Ibrahim Syed, ''[http://www.irfi.org/articles/articles_1_50/education_of_muslims_in_kentucky.htm Education of Muslims in Kentucky Prisons]''. Louisville: Islamic Research Foundation International&lt;/ref&gt; Some Muslim scholars hold that a prisoner may not be ransomed for gold or silver, but may be exchanged for Muslim prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;'Abu Yusuf Ya'qub Le Livre de l'impot foncier,' translated from Arabic and annotated by Edmond Fagnan, Paris, Paul Geuthner, 1991, pages 301-302. Abu Yusuf (d. 798 CE)&lt;/ref&gt;

Women and children prisoners of war cannot be killed under any circumstances, regardless of their religious convictions,&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Crone (2004), pp. 371-72&lt;/ref&gt; but they may be freed or ransomed. Women who are neither freed nor ransomed by their people were to be kept in bondage - also referred to as ''[[ma malakat aymanukum|malakah]]'', however dispute exists among scholars on the term's interpretation. Islamic law does not put an exact limit on the number that can be kept in bondage.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

==Internal conflict==
Internal conflicts include "civil wars", launched against rebels, and "wars for welfare" launched against bandits.&lt;ref name = D/&gt;

During their first civil war, Muslims fought at the [[Battle of Bassorah]]. In this engagement, [[Ali]] (the caliph), set the precedent for war against other Muslims, which most later Muslims have accepted. According to Ali's rules, wounded or captured enemies should not be killed, those throwing away their arms should not be fought, and those fleeing from the battleground should not be pursued. Only captured weapons and animals (horses and camels which have been used in the war) are to be considered war booty. No war prisoners, women or children are to be enslaved and the property of the slain enemies are to go to their legal Muslim heirs.&lt;ref&gt;Madelung (1997), p.179&lt;/ref&gt;

Different views regarding [[Insurgency|armed rebellion]] have prevailed in the Muslim world at different times. During the first three centuries of Muslim history, jurists held that a political rebel may not be executed nor his/her property confiscated.&lt;ref name = Fadl/&gt;

[[Islamic Golden Age|Classical]] jurists, however, laid down severe penalties for rebels who use "stealth attacks" and "spread [[terrorism|terror]]". In this category, Muslim jurists included [[kidnapping|abductions]], poisoning of water wells, [[arson]], attacks against wayfarers and travellers, [[assault]]s under the cover of night and [[rape]]. The punishment for such crimes were severe, including death, regardless of the political convictions and religion of the perpetrator. Further, rebels who committed acts of [[terrorism]] were granted no quarter.&lt;ref name = Fadl&gt;Abou El Fadl, Khaled. [Commentary: Terrorism Is at Odds With Islamic Tradition].

'''Istijarah''' ({{lang-ar|إستجارة}}, {{transl|ar|ALA|''Istijārah''}}) is an [[Islamic term]] for [[Asylum seeker#Asylum seekers|asylum]], accepting a person at risk as a member of own tribe.&lt;ref name="Doctrines"&gt;http://www.icmif.org/doc_store/takaful/Doctrines%20Justifying%20Takaful.doc&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
A system of [[clan]] protection existed in [[Pre-Islamic Arabia]], and people without a clan would stand without protection. Such a person could request for ''Istijarah'' (asylum) from a person already having a clan association in order to receive protection from that person. This was a common practice in [[Arabia]],&lt;ref name=Doctrines/&gt; this was used by some [[Muslim]]s who returned from the first [[Migration to Abyssinia]],&lt;ref name=sunnipath2&gt;[[The Sealed Nectar]] [http://www.sunnipath.com/Resources/PrintMedia/Books/B0033P0017.aspx The Second ‘Aqabah Pledge] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061128120537/http://www.sunnipath.com/Resources/PrintMedia/Books/B0033P0017.aspx |date=2006-11-28 }} on sunnipath.com&lt;/ref&gt; and Muhammad himself requested ''Istijarah'' from [[Mut'im ibn Adi]] after his return to [[Mecca]] from the [[Muhammad's visit to Ta'if|visit to Ta'if]].&lt;ref name=Doctrines/&gt; The term is also used in the Qur'an.&lt;ref name=Doctrines/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|9|6|quote=If one amongst the Pagans ask thee for asylum, grant it to him, so that he may hear the word of Allah; and then escort him to where he can be secure.

'''''Lewis Black's Root of All Evil''''' is an [[United States|American]] [[television series]] that premiered on March 12, 2008, on [[Comedy Central]] and was hosted by comedian [[Lewis Black]]. The series [[Television producer|producer]] was Scott Carter from ''[[Real Time with Bill Maher]]'' and the writer was David Sacks from ''[[The Simpsons]]''. Sometimes there were pre-recorded video segments directed by supervising producer Michael Addis.

''Lewis Black's Root of All Evil'' is formatted as a tongue-in-cheek [[mock trial]] acted in [[deadpan]]. Black presided over two opposing guest comedians championing a person or thing as the "root of all evil" ([[YouTube]], [[beer]], [[Oprah Winfrey]], [[PETA]], etc.).
The series ended on October 1, 2008, with a total of 18 episodes. The series' cancellation was confirmed by Lewis Black in September 2009. The entire first season of ''Lewis Black's Root of All Evil'' was released on [[DVD]] in the United States on September 30, 2008. The remaining episodes from season two are not currently available on DVD.

==Format==
Each show followed the same format: Black welcomed the viewer to his courtroom and announced the two Evil candidates for the Root of All Evil. Black gave a brief history of each of the Evils and introduced the two advocates, who presented their [[oral argument]]s why their Evil is the greater. Black began his inquisition, questioning the advocates about their Evils. Usually, the answers pointed out the good or usefulness of the opponent's Evil or the greater evil of their own. Black asked the advocates to predict what would happen if their Evil continued to spread. The ''Ripple of Evils'' used [[absurdity|absurd]], comedic [[logic]] and were generally very silly. After the advocates gave their [[closing argument]]s, Black asked for the audience's opinion, which he seldom followed, and announced his verdict and the loser's [[Sentence (law)|sentence]].

==Advocates==
The advocates were not the same every week, but six of the eight appeared multiple times. The advocates and their Win/Loss records are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/root_of_all_evil/prosecutors/index.jhtml|title= Prosecutors|publisher=Comedy Central|accessdate=2008-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* *No winner was declared in "Red States vs. Blue States". Instead, Black declared that the ''Root of All Evil'' was [[Puerto Rico]].  Therefore, the results were not counted in the Advocates' Win/Lose column.  However, the audience poll declared Red States the ''Root of All Evil'', which was counted in the Audience Poll columns.

==Reception==
Even before the first episode was broadcast, Brian Lowry in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' attacked the show, saying that the guest comedians were "second-tier" and that the set "resembles a cut-rate version of ''[[The Weakest Link]]'' set" and that "Comedy Central's programming usually falls squarely into the sublime or the ridiculous, so consider ''Root of All Evil'' a rare tweener in terms of quality—one that proves a whole lot of Black is preferable, albeit marginally, to a [[black hole]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lowry|first=Brian|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117936450.html?categoryid=1264&amp;cs=1|title=Lewis Black's Root of All Evil|publisher=''Variety''|date=2008-03-10|accessdate=2008-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attracting about 2.3 million viewers, the debut episode was the most-watched premiere episode of a [[Comedy Central]] series since the premiere of ''[[Chappelle's Show]]'' in 2003 and topped the demographics for male audiences ages 18 to 34.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Eggerton|first=John|title=Comedy Central: Black Is In for Summer|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA6562909.html?rssid=193|work=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|date=2008-05-21|accessdate=2008-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mark Dawidziak of ''[[The Plain Dealer]]'' wrote in his review, "I'm a sucker for a good Lewis rant, and sometimes ''Root of All Evil'' would benefit from more Lewis fomenting and less formula. For as long as it's around, though, it does make a good fit with a Comedy Central lineup that includes [[Jon Stewart]], [[Stephen Colbert]], [[Sarah Silverman]] and, of course, ''[[South Park]]''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dawidziak|first=Mark|url=http://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/plaindealer/index.ssf?/base/entertainment-0/1205310736327040.xml&amp;coll=2|title=Lewis Black's Root of All Evil a good match for still-sharp South Park|publisher=''The Plain Dealer''|date=2008-03-12|accessdate=2008-03-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607104455/http://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/plaindealer/index.ssf?%2Fbase%2Fentertainment-0%2F1205310736327040.xml&amp;coll=2|archivedate=2011-06-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 3rd Annual Independent Investigative Group [[IIG]] Awards presented an award to ''Root of All Evil'' recognizing the promotion of science and critical thinking in popular media on May 18, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iigwest.com/iigawards/2009/20090929_pressrelease.html |title=IIG &amp;#124; The IIG Awards |publisher=Iigwest.com |date=2010-08-21 |accessdate=2011-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cancellation==
While there was no official notice from Comedy Central, Lewis Black stated in a September 2009 interview that "the show is dead".&lt;ref name="Aol TV."&gt;{{cite web|last=Zaino|first=Nick|title=Lewis Black on his new special, The Daily Show, and the Root of All Evil|url=http://www.aoltv.com/2009/09/04/lewis-black-on-his-new-special-the-daily-show-and-the-root-of/|publisher=Aol TV.|date=4 September 2009|accessdate=29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these cases are leading English cases as the law of copyright in various [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] jurisdictions developed out of English law while these countries were colonies of the [[British Empire]].

'''MJur''' ('''Magister Juris''' or '''Master of Jurisprudence'''; common abbreviations include '''MJur''', '''M.Jur.''', '''Mag. Jur.''' and '''Mag. iur.''') is an [[academic degree]] in [[law]] awarded by some universities.

==  Magister Juris at the University of Oxford==
The Magister Juris (MJur) is a one-year master's level course offered at the University of Oxford. It is a postgraduate degree requiring a previous undergraduate degree in law for admission, and is thus comparable to an LL.M. It is a counterpart to the long-established [[Bachelor of Civil Law]] (BCL), with which it shares all course options, but for students from a [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] rather than a [[common law]] background.&lt;ref&gt;University of Oxford, Faculty of Law. [https://www.law.ox.ac.uk/admissions/postgraduate/magister-juris ''Magister Juris (MJur)'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, students from civil law jurisdictions were able to study for the BCL at Oxford, but had to meet additional requirements. Following the establishment of the Institute for European and Comparative Law at Oxford, in 1992 the faculty of law introduced a one-year degree programme of ''Magister Juris in European and Comparative Law'',&lt;ref&gt;Cf. University of Oxford, Faculty of Law. [https://books.google.de/books?id=iI5InwEACAAJ ''Degree of Magister Juris in European and Comparative Law''] (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1999/2000 closed the BCL to students from civil law jurisdictions. The Magister Juris at that time allowed to choose a number of undergraduate options, as well as an option in the history faculty.&lt;ref&gt;Steffen Knoblach. [http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:8ThI3MJARqIJ:rsw.beck.de/cms/%3Ftoc%3DJuS.30.1.4%26docid%3D5587+&amp;cd=2&amp;hl=de&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=de&amp;client=firefox-b ''M. Jur.-Studium in Oxford (England)''] (via Google Cache)&lt;/ref&gt; As the MJur and BCL programmes became more similar, the qualifier ''in European and Comparative Law'' was dropped in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. University of Oxford. [http://solo.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/OXVU1:LSCOP_OX:oxfaleph016993676 ''Examination for degree of Bachelor of civil law. Magister juris in European and comparative law.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The structure of the MJur nowadays is very similar to that of the BCL, and for the most part, BCL and MJur students study the same options in the same classes. Students select four options from a list of 40 or so available in common to BCL and MJur students. In place of one of the four taught options, students may also choose to write a dissertation of 10,000 to 12,500 words. Alternatively, MJur students may select one option from a list of approximately 12 courses from the undergraduate BA in Jurisprudence.  All taught options are taught by a combination of lectures and/or seminars and tutorials.&lt;ref&gt;University of Oxford, Faculty of Law. [https://www.law.ox.ac.uk/admissions/postgraduate/magister-juris ''Magister Juris (MJur)'']&lt;/ref&gt; Tutorials, which involve an intensive discussion between a tutor and two or three students, are a feature of the MJur and BCL programmes which is not offered in any taught graduate course in law elsewhere in the world.

Admission to the MJur is slightly more competitive than to the BCL: According to data disclosed by the University of Oxford, for 50 places available each year, 343 people applied on average in the three years before the academic year 2017/18,&lt;ref&gt;University of Oxford. ''Graduate Admissions: [https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/magister-juris Magister Juris]''&lt;/ref&gt; which equals an average application success rate of 14.6 %. The success rate for BCL applications in the same period was 16.3 %.&lt;ref&gt;University of Oxford. ''Graduate Admissions: [https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/bachelor-civil-law Bachelor of Civil Law]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic dress for the MJur is the same as for the BCL, an outward sign of their shared content and structure: A black gown of silk with a form of black lace sewn on the collar, the lower part of the back, and down the sleeves which are closed and cut straight, but have an opening just above the elbow. The hood, of Dean Burgon shape, is of blue corded silk or poplin with white fur fabric.&lt;ref&gt;Christ Church, University of Oxford. [http://www.chch.ox.ac.uk/current-students/academic-dress ''Academic Dress'']&lt;/ref&gt; Holders of the MJur degree rank directly below Bachelors of Civil Law, and above Bachelors of Medicine and Surgery.&lt;ref&gt;University of Oxford. ''Regulations for Degrees, Diplomas, and Certificates: [https://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/statutes/regulations/307-072.shtml#_Toc28140155 Council Regulations 22 of 2002. Part 2: Academic Precedence and Standing]''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Master of Jurisprudence at the Universities of Durham and Birmingham ==

Whereas the Oxford MJur is a taught degree, the MJur programmes offered by [https://www.dur.ac.uk/law/postgraduate/pgdegrees/degreetypes/ Durham] and [http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/students/courses/postgraduate/research/law/law.aspx Birmingham] are ''research'' degrees. It is awarded on the basis of a candidate's thesis (usually 40,000 words) in an approved area of law, under the supervision of an academic staff. The MJur must demonstrate an advanced understanding of the subject but - in contrast to a PhD - need not constitute an original contribution to knowledge nor reach a standard worthy of publication. Unlike LLM or Oxford's MJur dissertations, MJur degrees at Durham and Birmingham are examined by appointed internal and external examiners, for which a report is prepared. A [[Thesis|viva voce]], an essential component of PhDs at British universities, is unusual for MJur degrees.

== Germany ==

Historically, German law students did not receive any academic degree upon completion of their curriculum. Instead, after usually four or five years of study, students sit their First State Examination (''Erstes [[Staatsexamen]]'') in Law, which is administered by the ministry of justice of the respective state, not the university. More recently, however, some universities have begun to award their students a Magister Juris upon passing the First State Examination, in order to indicate the equivalence of the education to a master's degree in other disciplines. Examples include the universities of [[Cologne]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jura.uni-koeln.de/345.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719105306/http://www.jura.uni-koeln.de/345.html |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;,  [[Constance]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uni-konstanz.de/studium/pdf/pruefinfo/MagisterJurisAntragEF.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090731065506/http://www.uni-konstanz.de/studium/pdf/pruefinfo/MagisterJurisAntragEF.pdf |archivedate=2009-07-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Heidelberg University|Heidelberg]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jura.uni-heidelberg.de/studium/Graduierung.html&lt;/ref&gt;. Other German universities are awarding a [[Diplom-Jurist]] degree to their law examinees, following the same principle.

== Austria ==

Austrian law students are usually awarded a "Mag. iur." after completion of a four-year curriculum. On average it takes students 13.6 semesters to complete the curriculum. Despite the Bologna process Law is one of the studies that still stick to the traditional Austrian system without a bachelor's degree and a Magister Juris as the first academic degree.

== Italy ==
After the Bologna process, the former ''Laurea di dottore in Giurisprudenza'' had been replaced by a first level degree, ''Laurea in Scienze Giuridiche'' (three years), and a second level degree, ''Laurea Specialistica in Giurisprudenza'' (two further years). This system changed in 2006: at present the ''Laurea Magistrale in Giurisprudenza'' (i.e., Magister Juris) is the Law degree in Italy. It is a five-year, second level ([[master's degree|master's]]) degree which does not require a previous bachelor's degree for the admission (''[[Laurea|Laurea Magistrale a ciclo unico]]'', i.e. integrated master's degree).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11223">'''[[Manslaughter]]''' is a crime in the [[United States]]. Definitions can vary among jurisdictions, but manslaughter is invariably the act of causing the death of another person in a manner less [[culpable]] than [[murder]].

==Laws in the United States==
===Voluntary manslaughter===
Voluntary manslaughter involves the intentional killing of a person in which the offender did not have prior intent to kill.&lt;ref name="findlaw"&gt;{{cite web|title=Voluntary Manslaughter Overview|url=http://criminal.findlaw.com/criminal-charges/voluntary-manslaughter-overview.html|website=FindLaw|accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="el"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=What Are Homicide and Murder|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/criminal-law/what-are-homicide-and-murder|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=10 September 2017|date=7 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The defendant may have the intention of causing serious injury short of death.

The following are some examples of defenses that may be raised to mitigate murder to voluntary manslaughter:
* '''Heat of Passion''': A killing that occurs after ''provocation'' by an event which would cause a reasonable person to lose self-control. There must not be a ''cooling off period'' negating provocation. If there is an interval between the provocation and killing sufficient to allow the passion of a reasonable person to cool, the homicide is not manslaughter, but murder.&lt;ref name="findlaw"/&gt;
* '''[[Imperfect self-defense]]''': In some jurisdictions, a person who acted in self-defense with an honest but ''unreasonable'' belief that deadly force was necessary to do so can reduce a murder charge to one of voluntary manslaughter or deliberate homicide committed without criminal malice. (''Malice'' is found if a person is killed intentionally and without legal excuse or mitigation.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Logan|first1=James C.|title=Imperfect Self-Defense|journal=Washington University Law Review|date=1935|volume=20|page=131|url=http://openscholarship.wustl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4530&amp;context=law_lawreview|accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Diminished capacity''' is a defense that may negate the mental state of "malice". If a jurisdiction recognizes that a person can kill without justification but also without any evil intent, for example due to a mental defect or mental illness, that jurisdiction may define the person's crime as something less than murder. This partial defense is only available in some U.S. jurisdictions and not others; whereas the complete defense of [[Insanity defense|insanity]] is available throughout the U.S. but is rarely used because it is more difficult to prove.&lt;ref name="wex"&gt;{{cite web|title=Diminished Capacity|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/diminished_capacity|website=Wex|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Involuntary manslaughter===
Involuntary manslaughter is the killing of another person without the intent to kill, but where the person's death occurs as a result of the negligent or reckless actions of the defendant.&lt;ref name="el"/&gt;

====Constructive manslaughter====
In the United States, ''constructive manslaughter'', also known as ''unlawful act manslaughter'', is a lesser version of [[felony murder]], and covers a person who causes the death of another while committing a [[misdemeanor]]{{spaced ndash}}that is, a violation of law that doesn't rise to the level of a [[felony]]. Such a law may allow for [[conviction (law)|conviction]] for the homicide if the misdemeanor law that was violated by the defendant is a law designed to protect human life.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite web|title=Comber v. US 584 A. 2d 26 (D.C. 1990) (en banc)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11643150613330829206|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criminally negligent manslaughter====
In some U.S. jurisdictions, if a person is so reckless as to "manifest extreme indifference to human life", the defendant may be guilty of aggravated assault as well as of involuntary manslaughter.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite web|title=18 Pa.C.S.A. Sec. 2702. Aggravated assault|url=https://govt.westlaw.com/pac/Document/NE1A106A087AF11E392C78350E889256B?viewType=FullText&amp;originationContext=documenttoc&amp;transitionType=CategoryPageItem&amp;contextData=(sc.Default)|website=WestLaw|publisher=Thomson Reuters|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some U.S. jurisdictions, malice may be found if the defendant's actions reflect ''willful'' or ''depraved'' indifference to human life. In such a case, even though the injury to the victim was not intended, the wrongdoer may be guilty of ''second degree murder''.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., subsection (b), {{cite web|title=New York Penal Code, Sec. 125.25. Murder in the second degree|url=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/PEN/125.25|website=New York State Senate|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also, {{cite web|title=State v. Fenner, 664 So. 2d 1315 (La. App. 4 Cir. 1995)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14884766529024668605|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vehicular manslaughter====
[[Vehicular manslaughter]] is a class C felony which holds people liable for any death which occurs because of criminal negligence, or a violation of traffic safety laws. A common use of the vehicular manslaughter laws involves prosecution for a death caused by [[driving under the influence]] of [[Substance intoxication|intoxicating substances]] (determined by excessive [[blood alcohol content]] levels set by individual U.S. states), although an independent infraction (such as driving with a suspended [[driver's license]]), or negligence, is usually also required.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite web|title=New York Penal Code, Sec. 125.13. Vehicular manslaughter in the first degree.|url=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/PEN/125.13|website=New York State Senate|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also {{cite web|title=California Penal Code, Sec. 192(c)|url=https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&amp;sectionNum=192.|website=California Legislative Information|publisher=California Legislature|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Wisconsin, a person who causes death with any type of motor vehicle while legally intoxicated may be liable and charged with homicide by intoxicated use of a motor vehicle. Culpability lies with the perpetrator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wisconsin Statutes, Sec. 940.09. Homicide by intoxicated use of vehicle or firearm.|url=https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/940/I/09|website=Wisconsin State Legislature|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The maximum penalty for homicide by intoxicated use of a vehicle is twenty-five years in prison, but with a prior OWI offense the maximum penalty may be increased to forty years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OWI and Related Alcohol and Drug Penalties|url=http://wisconsindot.gov/Documents/safety/education/drunk-drv/owi-penchrt.pdf|website=Wisconsin DOT|publisher=Government of Wisconsin|accessdate=10 September 2017|date=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the State of [[Texas]], ''intoxication manslaughter'' is a distinctly defined offense. A person commits intoxication manslaughter if he, or she, operates a motor vehicle in a public place, operates an aircraft, a watercraft, or an amusement ride, or assembles a mobile amusement ride while [[Substance intoxication|intoxicated]] and, by reason of that intoxication, causes the death of another by accident or mistake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Texas Penal Code, Sec. 49.08. Intoxication Manslaughter|url=http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/PE/htm/PE.49.htm#49.08|website=Texas State Legislature|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intoxication manslaughter, vehicular manslaughter and other similar offenses require a lesser [[mens rea]] than other manslaughter offenses. Furthermore, the fact that the defendant is entitled to use the alcohol, controlled substance, drug, dangerous drug, or other substance, is no defense.&lt;ref name="intoxmantx"&gt;{{cite web|title=Texas Penal Code, Sec. 49.10. No Defense|url=http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/PE/htm/PE.49.htm#49.10|website=Texas State Legislature|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also, {{cite web|title=Nelson v. State, 149 S.W.3d 206, 211 (Tex. App.-Fort Worth 2004, no pet.)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13137764890969352327|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, to prove intoxication manslaughter, it is '''not''' necessary to prove the person was negligent in causing the death of another, nor that they unlawfully used the substance that intoxicated them, but only that they were intoxicated, and operated a motor vehicle, and someone died as a result.&lt;ref name="intoxmantx"/&gt;

The same principle of strict liability applies in [[New York (state)|New York]] for vehicular manslaughter in the second degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New York Penal Code, Sec. 125.12. Vehicular manslaughter in the second degree.|url=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/PEN/125.12|website=New York State Senate|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Assisted suicide====
In some U.S. states, [[assisted suicide]] is punishable as manslaughter, while others classify it as an independent criminal offense or as a form of murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Assisted Suicide Laws in the United States|url=http://www.patientsrightscouncil.org/site/assisted-suicide-state-laws/|website=Patients Rights Council|accessdate=10 September 2017|date=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Manslaughter in the second degree}}

===Terminology===

As each state has its own statutes, law that cover the same criminal conduct may have different names. For example:
* New York State defines ''manslaughter in the first degree'' as conduct that causes a death with intent to cause serious physical injury, a definition that corresponds to "voluntary manslaughter" in most other states. If the defendant's intent was to cause death, the charge would be murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New York Penal Code, Sec.125.20. Manslaughter in the first degree.|url=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/PEN/125.20|website=New York State Senate|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* New York defines ''manslaughter in the second degree'' as a death that occurs without intent to cause serious physical injury, but where reckless conduct by the defendant resulted in death.  This corresponds to "involuntary manslaughter" in most other states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New York Penal Code, Sec.125.15. Manslaughter in the second degree.|url=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/PEN/125.15|website=New York State Senate|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2285">'''Maîtresses marchandes lingères''' was a French [[Guild]] organisation for women [[linen]] draper [[seamstress]]es and hemp merchants within the city of [[Paris]], active from the Middle Ages until 1791.  It was one of only three guilds open to women in Paris prior to 1776, the other two being the ''[[Maitresses bouquetieres]]'' and the ''[[Maîtresses couturières]]''.

==History==
The guild was formed in the 13th- or 14th-century, and was one of the strongest guilds in Paris until the [[French Revolution]] of 1789, both in money and status.   The linen seamstresses sold [[lace]] and all manner of clothing made of linen and [[Cannabis sativa]].   They manufactured all sorts of products made of linen, on and off commission.    In accordance with the privileges of the guild, a linen seamstress did not become a minor under the guardianship of her husband when she married, which was an exception from contemporary law of married women's minority.&lt;ref&gt;Du Rietz, Anita (2013). Kvinnors entreprenörskap: under 400 år (1). Stockholm: Dialogos. Libris 13541091. {{ISBN|978-91-7504-257-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The guild was somewhat unusual: though the profession of seamstress was very common and socially accepted for a woman, it was normally practiced outside of the guilds in Europe prior to the 19th-century, and discriminated by the [[tailor]]'s guilds.  Paris was rare in having an actual guild for seamstresses, and it was further increased with the ''[[Maîtresses couturières]]'' of 1675 and the ''[[Marchandes de modes]]'' of 1776.&lt;ref&gt;Du Rietz, Anita (2013).

A '''Measure of the National Assembly for Wales''' (informally, an '''Assembly Measure''') is [[primary legislation]] in [[Wales]] that is a category lower than an [[Act of Parliament]]. In the case of [[Contemporary Welsh Law]], the difference with Acts is that the competence to pass Measures is subject to 'LCOs' or [[Legislative Competence Order]], which transfers powers to the Assembly by amending Schedule 5 of the [[Government of Wales Act 2006]].

It was a lower form of [[primary legislation]] as it did not contain a large bulk of powers compared to the power to make acts. In Wales each Assembly Measure had to be accompanied with a Matter which was transferred using the Legislative Competence Order (LCO) system. Each Assembly Measure, like an Act of Parliament, had to have made provision for a matter within the remit of the legislative competency of the Assembly. 

Following a [[Welsh devolution referendum, 2011|referendum]] held in 2011, the assembly gained powers to make primary legislation known as [[Act of the National Assembly for Wales|Acts of the Assembly]]. These powers came into force after the [[National Assembly for Wales election, 2011|2011 assembly elections]] and the assembly is no longer able to pass Measures. Existing measures will remain valid unless repealed by the assembly in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-12639379|title=It's a Yes.

=== Consideration by the Assembly ===
Like Acts, Assembly Measures face the same style of scrutiny. There were around four stages where the proposed legislation was scrutinised.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assemblywales.org/bus-home/buslegislation/bus-legislation-meas-in-prog.htm National Assembly for Wales | Measures in Progress&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926234642/http://www.assemblywales.org/bus-home/buslegislation/bus-legislation-meas-in-prog.htm |date=2007-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first stage is the agreement of the principles of the Assembly Measure, which means the first approval of the legislation for it to be scrutinised, then it will have to be scrutinized at committee level, where a committee of Assembly Members can debate and add more to the Measure which is then accompanied with debates in 'plenary', which would be required to approve the amendments. 

Once everything above has been completed, the Assembly can then start the final scrutinising before the Assembly Measure gets passed and becomes law. As in other legislative systems, some laws will fail, or be withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assemblywales.org/bus-home/buslegislation/bus-legislation-meas-withdrawn.htm National Assembly for Wales | Measures Rejected or Withdrawn&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926234807/http://www.assemblywales.org/bus-home/buslegislation/bus-legislation-meas-withdrawn.htm |date=2007-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Royal Approval ===
Assembly Measures, like all other types of legislation, will have to be approved by a [[head of state]], that head of state being [[Majesty|Her Majesty]] [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]]. After the Assembly Measure is passed by the [[National Assembly for Wales]] the Measure will have to be taken to the Queen in Council who approves the Measure via an [[Order in Council]]. The approval would later be added to the Assembly Measure as proof of the approval. The approving order in council is not approved by both Houses of Parliament like the Orders in Council conferring power to the Assembly.

=== Who could propose Assembly Measures ===
Like in any legislature, the National Assembly for Wales members can propose Assembly Measures. The name for an Assembly Measure proposed by a person not in the Welsh Assembly Government will be called a "Members Proposed Assembly Measure" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.walesoffice.gov.uk/2007/leg_SO_March2007.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070804190244/http://www.walesoffice.gov.uk/2007/leg_SO_March2007.pdf |archivedate=2007-08-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, according to the same source there will also be "Government Proposed Assembly Measures" and "Emergency Proposed Assembly Measures".  The [[First Welsh Legislative Counsel]], a new post which commenced April 2007, working within the Office of the First Welsh Legislative Counsel, part of the Legal Services Department of the Welsh Assembly Government has responsibility for the drafting of the Welsh Assembly Government's legislative programme following the implementation of the Government of Wales Act 2006. Professor [[Thomas Glyn Watkin]] is the first person to be appointed to this post.

=== Enacting formula ===
Assembly measures begin with the following [[enacting formula]]:

*English: "This Measure, passed by the National Assembly for Wales on [Date] and approved by Her Majesty in Council on [Date], enacts the following provisions:-" 
*Welsh: "Mae'r Mesur hwn, a basiwyd gan Gynulliad Cenedlaethol Cymru ar [Dyddiad] ac a gymeradwywyd gan Ei Mawrhydi yn ei Chyngor ar [Dyddiad], yn deddfu'r darpariaethau a ganlyn:-"

== Confusion ==
When the [[Government of Wales Act 2006]] was passed, some people reading it became confused as to what the difference between an Assembly Measure and an [[Legislative Competency Order|Order-in-Council]] is. Some people thought that the Order-in-Council was just a way of conferring power to the Assembly so the Assembly could make more 'delegated legislation'. However, the Act states that the Orders in Council are used only to transfer legal power to the Assembly. In this way, the Assembly, without having to go to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]], could then legislate using the 'Assembly Measures' system instead of making [[Act of Parliament|Acts]] straight off. An Assembly Measure could then confer power to the Welsh ministers to make delegated legislation, or statutory instruments as guided within the Measure.

The "'''New Cult Awareness Network'''" (NCAN, often referred to as simply the "'''Cult Awareness Network'''", though other than inheriting the name, it is unrelated to [[cult Awareness Network|that older group]]) is an organization that provides information about cults, and is owned and operated by associates of the [[Church of Scientology]], itself categorized in many countries as a cult. It was formed in 1996, with the name purchased from the now defunct [[Cult Awareness Network]], an organization that provided information on groups it considered to be cults, and that strongly opposed Scientology.

The "New CAN" organization (also known as the '''Foundation for Religious Freedom''') has caused both confusion and controversy among academics and its opponents.  Board members of the "Old CAN" have characterized it as a [[front group]] for the Church of Scientology. In December 1997, ''[[60 Minutes]]'' profiled the controversy regarding the history of the "Old CAN" and the "New CAN", with host [[Lesley Stahl]] noting, "Now, when you call looking for information about a cult, chances are the person you're talking to is a Scientologist". [[James R. Lewis (writer)|James R. Lewis]] has described "New CAN" as "a genuine information and networking center on non-traditional religions". [[Margaret Thaler Singer]] expressed the opinion that any experts the public would be referred to by the "New CAN" would be [[cult apologist]]s. Shupe and Darnell noted the "New CAN" had been able to attract support from donors such as [[Amazon.com]], and by 2000 it was receiving thousands of phone calls per month. The "New CAN" promotes itself as a champion of [[human rights]] and [[freedom of religion]]. An August 2007 article on [[Fox News]] on the [[Wikipedia Scanner]] noted "a computer linked to the Church of Scientology's network was used to delete references to links between it and [...] the 'Cult Awareness Network'" on [[Wikipedia]].&lt;ref name="foxnews"/&gt;

== History ==

===Bought in bankruptcy court===
[[Image:United States Bankruptcy Court Seal.png|thumb|right|Seal of the United States bankruptcy court. [[Church of Scientology]] attorney Steven Hayes bought rights to the Cult Awareness Network assets during its bankruptcy proceedings.]]

The old [[Cult Awareness Network]], which publicly opposed Scientology as well as other groups it considered to be cults, was driven into bankruptcy by litigation costs in 1996. Subsequently, [[Church of Scientology]] attorney Steven Hayes appeared in [[bankruptcy court]] and won the bidding for what remained of the organization for an amount of $20,000: the name, logo, phone number, office equipment, and judgments that the organization had won but not yet collected.&lt;ref name="goodstein"&gt;{{cite web | first = Laurie | last = Goodstein | title = It's A Hostile Takeover Of A Nonprofit | url = http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=2362655&amp;date=19961201 | work = [[Washington Post]] | publisher = [[Seattle Times]] | date = 1996-12-01 | accessdate = 2008-05-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the Scientologists did not gain access to the CAN files, because of the threat of litigation against the bankruptcy trustee; the files were returned to the board.&lt;ref name="1997bankruptcy"&gt;{{cite news

Individuals who had confided in the "Old CAN" organization expressed anxiety about their confidential files being sold to other groups, but Moxon stated: "People who have committed crimes don't want them to be revealed".&lt;ref name="carpenter"&gt;{{cite news  | last =Carpenter | first =John | title =Fate of files worries anti-cult group's clients | page =1 | publisher =Chicago Sun-Times, Inc | date =December 6, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Anson Shupe|Shupe]], Darnell and Moxon, there is evidence that a number of documents in the files were destroyed by unknown persons at CAN in the early to mid-nineties, during the time when CAN and its directors were embroiled in legal battles.&lt;ref name="davis"&gt;{{Cite book

==Reception==

[[Image:CCHR.jpg|thumb|right|An article published by the "New" Cult Awareness Network in 2000 on the group [[Aum Shinrikyo]] thanked the [[Citizen's Commission on Human Rights]] for their [[Scientology and psychiatry|research on psychiatry]].]]

The site does not contain any criticism of Scientology, unlike most other sites which claim to provide anti-cult information (other than those dedicated to other specific groups).  In the Scientology publication IMPACT, Nr. 72, Scientologist and CAN VP Jean Hornnes explained, "We have successfully prevented deprogrammings and we have taken broken families and helped to put them back together by using standard [[Lafayette Ronald Hubbard|LRH]] technology on handling [[Potential Trouble Source|PTS]]ness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | last =Hornnes  | first =Jean  |  title =We have successfully prevented deprogrammings and we have taken broken families and helped to put them back together by using standard [[Lafayette Ronald Hubbard|LRH]] technology on handling [[Potential Trouble Source|PTS]]ness. | work =IMPACT magazine |   publisher =[[Church of Scientology]] | issue = 72 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note: [[Potential Trouble Source|PTS]] means "[[Potential Trouble Source]]", see [[Scientology beliefs and practices]]&lt;/ref&gt;  In January 1997, shortly after the formation of the New CAN, brochures mailed out by the organization described Scientology as a way to "increase happiness and improve conditions for oneself and for others".&lt;ref name="frantz"&gt;{{cite web | first = Douglas | last = Frantz | title = An Ultra-Aggressive Use of Investigators and the Courts | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F01E3D71639F93AA35750C0A961958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all | work =  | publisher = [[New York Times]] | date = 1997-03-09 | accessdate = 2007-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1961">The '''Southern Africa Non-aggression Pact''' required signatory states to ensure that no individual or organization attacked a signatory state from signatory soil. Presidents [[Jose Eduardo dos Santos]] of [[Angola]], [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] of [[Zaire]], and [[Kenneth Kaunda]] of [[Zambia]] signed the agreement on October 14, 1979. The signatories also signed a treaty on transportation and communication cooperation the same day.&lt;ref name=a&gt;{{cite book|last=Osmanczyk|first=Edmund Jan|year=2002|title=Encyclopedia of the United Nations and International Agreements|pages=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[non-aggression pact]] largely held together until Angola, along with most of [[Southern Africa]], invaded the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] in 1996 in the [[First Congo War]].{{Fact|date=January 2008}}

The treaty came in direct response to [[Cuba]]'s invasions of Zaire from Angola [[Shaba I|in 1977]] and [[Shaba II|1978]]. Mobutu and Kaunda's support for [[National Liberation Front of Angola]] (FNLA) and National Union for the Total Independence of Angola ([[UNITA]]) rebels in the [[Angolan Civil War]] and dos Santos' support for the [[Front for the National Liberation of the Congo]] in Zaire led to repeated clashes in the 1970s.{{Fact|date=January 2008}}

Most notable is [[South Africa]]'s absence in signing the treaty, considering the [[apartheid]] government's support for UNITA in Angola exceeded all other nations and South Africa's support for [[Renamo]] in [[Mozambique]].{{Fact|date=January 2008}}

'''''O'Connor v. Ortega''''', 480 U.S. 709 (1987), is a [[United States Supreme Court]] decision on the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] rights of government employees with regard to administrative searches in the workplace, during investigations by supervisors for violations of employee policy rather than by law enforcement for criminal offenses. It was brought by Magno Ortega, a doctor at a California state hospital after his supervisors found allegedly inculpatory evidence in his office while he was on [[administrative leave]] pending an investigation of alleged misconduct. Some of what they uncovered was later used to [[witness impeachment|impeach a witness]] who testified on his behalf at the hearing where he unsuccessfully appealed his [[termination of employment|dismissal]].

Although lower courts had considered the issue, it was [[first impression (law)|the first time]] the Supreme Court had. By a 5-4 margin, the Court ruled that public employees retain their Fourth Amendment rights. Justice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]]'s [[plurality opinion]] established an "operating realities" test for future courts to consider when public employees challenged searches during investigations, reflecting the lower [[reasonable suspicion]] standard the government had to meet as an employer. That did not establish binding [[precedent]], since [[Antonin Scalia]] argued in a separate [[concurring opinion]] that her standard was too vague, and that the same searches which would be reasonable for a private employer were proper when conducted by their public counterparts. [[Harry Blackmun]] wrote for four dissenting justices that the search was clearly an investigatory one and thus a breach of the doctor's privacy.

Since it could not decide how to apply that standard to Ortega's case as the record at that time did not establish whether the entry into Ortega's office had been for search purposes or not, the majority [[remand (court procedure)|remand]]ed the case to the district court. Eleven more years of litigation followed. At some points during it Ortega had to [[pro se|represent himself]], and the Court itself had taken the unusual step of inviting [[Joel Klein]] to [[oral argument|argue Ortega's case before them]]. It went back and forth between the district and appellate courts twice. Ortega finally prevailed after a jury trial in the late 1990s, and the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit]] denied Ortega's superiors their appeal.

Despite the two different standards resulting from the split five-justice majority, lower courts have generally followed O'Connor's "operational realities" test in future cases involving actual searches. Observers thought the justices might resolve the conflict the next time a similar case of public employees alleging a search violated their Fourth Amendment rights came before it. When it did, in 2010's ''[[Ontario v. Quon]]'', they declined to do so, leaving the matter open for yet another future Court.

==Underlying dispute==

In March 1981, Dr. Ortega, for 17 years the head of the psychiatric [[resident physician|residency]] program at [[Napa State Hospital]], a [[mental hospital]] in [[Napa, California]], purchased a new [[Apple II]] computer to use in running the program. Half of the money for it had been donated by some of the residents; Ortega covered the rest. A month later, he asked Dr. Dennis O'Connor, the hospital's executive director and his superior, to sign some thank-you letters to the residents who had made contributions, and to authorize some purchase orders for [[peripheral]]s and other accessories for the computer.&lt;ref name="1998 appellate decision"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=O'Connor v. Ortega |vol=146 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=1149 |pinpoint= |court=9th Cir. |date=1998 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/146/1149/513871/ |accessdate=2018-09-29 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Connor was not sure whether the computer had been properly donated to the hospital, and hesitated to sign the letters. Two months later, Ortega [[suspension (punishment)|suspended]] a resident for failing to report for a [[Clerkship (medicine)|rotation]]. The resident complained to Dorothy Owen, the hospital's personnel director, that Ortega was retaliating against him for not only having not contributed to the purchase of the computer but advising other residents to ask him for their money back.&lt;ref name="1998 appellate decision" /&gt;

In late July, Owen told O'Connor of the resident's complaint. O'Connor asked Richard Friday, the [[health administration|hospital administrator]], to begin an investigation into the resident's allegations specifically and the purchase of the computer generally. He gave Friday and his investigative team broad authority, including permission to search Ortega's office. The hospital otherwise had no policy on such searches.&lt;ref name="1998 appellate decision" /&gt;

O'Connor asked Ortega to take [[administrative leave]] the next day. Ortega instead received O'Connor's approval for two weeks of paid vacation, after which the administrative leave began. O'Connor told Ortega not to return to the hospital without his permission during his vacation. During the time Ortega was on vacation, Friday had the lock changed and kept the key in his own office.&lt;ref name="1998 appellate decision" /&gt;

When Ortega's vacation ended, O'Connor sent a letter to Ortega informing him he was now on paid administrative leave, and extending the restriction on visits to the hospital. Before Ortega had received it, he returned to the hospital. Finding his office door locked and unable to open it himself, he took the computer, then in an unsecured nearby room, home to work with it there, as he had done on occasion in the past.&lt;ref name="1998 appellate decision" /&gt;

Upon learning of this, O'Connor called the hospital police, believing that the computer was state property and thus Ortega had stolen it. At some other point during the time Ortega was on vacation and leave, a staff psychiatrist who ran a [[support group]] for residents told O'Connor about complaints of possible [[sexual harassment]] on Ortega's part from two female residents. It was not clear whether this took place before or after at least one thorough, highly intrusive search of Ortega's office. Materials were removed from Ortega's office, boxed and stored&lt;ref name="1998 appellate decision" /&gt; when the security guard performing the inventory found it too difficult to sort out Ortega's property from the state's.

On a separate visit to Ortega's office, Friday found several items—a [[Valentine's Day|Valentine]], suggestively posed photo and inscribed book of love poetry—sent to Ortega several years earlier by a former resident. After the hospital fired Ortega in September, he appealed to the State Personnel Board. When the former resident testified on Ortega's behalf during the hearing, these items were introduced in an attempt to [[witness impeachment|impeach]] her.&lt;ref name="1998 appellate decision" /&gt;

Owen asked Ortega after the firing if he wanted his personal possessions from his office returned. He did not. By spring of 1982 he had changed his mind. In response to another request, Asher Rubin, the deputy attorney general who had represented the state before the Personnel Board, told him he could make copies of his personal papers but could not keep the originals, nor any of his other personal property.&lt;ref name="1998 appellate decision" /&gt;

==Litigation==

Ortega retained an attorney and filed a [[Section 1983]] suit against O'Connor (who had now become director of the [[California Department of Mental Health]]&lt;ref name="O'Connor promotion"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Estate of Marilyn Marie Conners v. O'Connor |vol=8 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=26 |pinpoint= |court=9th Cir. |date=1993 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/8/26/614563/ |accessdate=2018-09-29 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;)  Owen, Friday, other parties and the state shortly afterwards in [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|federal court]], seeking $750,000 in [[compensatory damages|compensatory]] and [[punitive damages]]. In addition to the violation of his [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] protections against unreasonable search and seizure, he made [[tort]] claims for [[invasion of privacy]] and breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealings under California law. The defendants argued that they had entered Ortega's office and gone through the contents of his desk purely to [[inventory]] property and separate state-owned items from the doctor's personal possessions, which it claimed was standard practice when employees had resigned or been terminated. Both sides moved for [[summary judgement]], which Judge [[John P. Vukasin Jr.]] granted to the defendants on all claims. It found that the entry into Ortega's office had been for the purpose of securing state property for use by a successor.&lt;ref name="1985 appellate court decision"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Ortega v. O'Connor |vol=764 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=703 |pinpoint= |court=[[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|9th Cir.]] |date=1985 |url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9263686026430688732 |accessdate=2018-09-29 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ortega appealed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit]]. In 1985 a three-judge panel unanimously reversed the district court on the search but upheld it on the state-law tort claims. "The entry into the office seems to have been for no other purpose than to secure evidence for use in the ongoing investigation of Ortega," Judge [[Dorothy Wright Nelson]] wrote." While the state had said that the entry to the office was not intended as a search, she noted that at the time the doctor had not yet been fired or resigned but was merely on administrative leave. Nor did this seem to have been regularly undertaken in situations where it did apply.&lt;ref name="1985 appellate court decision" /&gt;

After that finding, Wright considered whether such a warrantless search was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment. She applied the two-pronged test from the Supreme Court's 1967 ''[[Katz v. United States]]'' decision&lt;ref name="Katz cite"&gt;''[[Katz v. United States]]'', {{ussc|389|347|1967}}.&lt;/ref&gt; to establish whether Dr. Ortega had a [[reasonable expectation of privacy]] over the contents of his desk and office. First, did he have a subjective expectation that they would be left undisturbed by others, and second, would that expectation be one that society would consider reasonable and respect?&lt;ref name="1985 appellate court decision" /&gt;

On the first prong, he had occupied the office for all 17 years of his employment. He kept within his desk not only personal papers and effects but confidential patient records. He had believed he had the only key, and was not aware of any other time during his employment at Napa in which his office had been entered without his permission. In ''[[Mancusi v. DeForte]]'',&lt;ref name="Mancusi cite"&gt;''Mancusi v. DeForte'', {{ussc|392|364|1968}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court had held that an employee can have a reasonable expectation of privacy over his or her desk at work from searches by law enforcement.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The Court, in that case, overturned the conviction of a [[Long Island]] labor union official on corruption and racketeering-related charges since the principal evidence had been taken from his desk by investigators who only had a [[subpoena]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1985 appellate court decision" /&gt; 

Two cases from the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit|Third Circuit]], with direct similarities to Ortega's, argued for the reasonableness of his privacy expectation. In one,&lt;ref name="Gillard v. Schmidt"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Gillard v. Schmidt |vol=579 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=825 |pinpoint= |court=[[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit|3d Cir.]] |date=1978 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/579/825/126861/ |accessdate=2018-09-29 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the presence of sensitive and confidential documents within a desk&lt;ref group="note"&gt;In that case, a member of the [[Fair Lawn, New Jersey]], [[board of education|school board]] had opened a [[guidance counselor]]'s desk drawer and found the original draft of a pseudonymously published cartoon that ridiculed the board.&lt;/ref&gt; was held to strengthen the privacy expectation; and in the other,&lt;ref name="United States v. Speights"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=United States v. Speights |vol=557 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=362 |pinpoint= |court=3d Cir. |date=1977 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/557/362/272873/ |accessdate=2018-09-29 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the personal lock that a police officer had used for his department locker led to the suppression of a sawed-off shotgun seized by federal agents.&lt;ref name="1985 appellate court decision" /&gt;

In the latter case, the department had also lacked a formal policy on whether the lockers could be searched, as had been the case at Napa. This Wright used to distinguish it and Ortega's case from other precedents&lt;ref name="precedents with search policies"&gt;''United States v. Bunkers'', 521 [[F.2d]] [https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/521/1217/70361/ 1217] (9th Cir. 1975); ''United States v. Collins'', 349 F.2d [https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/349/863/104340/ 863] ([[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|2d Cir.]] 1965), ''[[certiorari|cert]]''. denied, {{ussc|383|960|1966|el=no}} and {{cite court |litigants=Chenkin v. Bellevue Hospital Center, New York City Health &amp; Hospitals Corporation |vol=479 |reporter=F. Supp. |opinion=207 |pinpoint= |court=[[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|S.D.N.Y.]] |date=1979 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/479/207/2263945/ |accessdate=2018-09-29 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where warrantless searches of public employees' lockers, jackets or backpacks had been upheld due to broadly disseminated and actively implemented policies that such searches could occur at any time. "Here, Napa had never instituted surveillance or searches and had no general inspection policy that might have defeated Ortega's expectation of privacy in his office," she concluded.&lt;ref name="1985 appellate court decision" /&gt;

The appeals court ordered the district court to enter judgement in Ortega's favor on that issue and hold proceedings to fix damages. The pendent state-law claims had not been filed in a timely fashion, and the panel affirmed that part of the summary judgement.&lt;ref name="1985 appellate court decision" /&gt;

==Before the Court==

The state of California's ''[[certiorari]]'' petition was granted by the Supreme Court in 1985.&lt;ref name="Cert grant"&gt;{{ussc|474|1018|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since he was [[Pro se legal representation in the United States|representing himself]], Ortega filed his own [[brief (law)|brief]]. The Court invited [[Joel Klein]], the future [[New York City Schools Chancellor]] then in private practice, to argue Ortega's case,&lt;ref name="Klein invitation"&gt;{{ussc|475|1006|1985}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and he also filed an ''[[amicus curiae]]'' brief on Ortega's behalf. 

The appellants' brief was filed by [[Attorney General of California|California Attorney General]] [[John Van de Kamp]] and several of his assistants. [[Solicitor General of the United States|Solicitor General]] [[Charles Fried]] filed an ''amicus'' brief on behalf of the federal government urging reversal. The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] and [[American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees]] urged affirmance in their ''amici''. [[Oral argument]]s were held in October 1986.

===Petitioners' oral argument===

Jeffrey T. Miller, one of Van de Kamp's deputies, argued for the petitioners. He did not deny that government employees had Fourth Amendment rights, but "the activity that took place in this case did not constitute a search within Fourth Amendment jurisprudence". He insisted that the Court should follow the district court's lead in finding that Dr. Ortega's office had been inventoried, not searched, until he was reminded that the district court had merely found the action to be a securing of the property in case Ortega returned to remove something else, and had not even used the word "inventory." It would not have been reasonable for the doctor to have imagined that no one else would or could have entered the office without his consent or knowledge in the 17 years he was employed at Napa.&lt;ref name="Oral argument for petitioner"&gt;{{cite web|title=Argument of Jeffrey Miller|url=https://www.oyez.org/cases/1980-1989/1986/1986_85_530/argument|publisher=The Oyez Project|date=October 16, 1986|accessdate=January 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Likewise, a desk was a "common repository", likely to be used by many people besides the one regularly seated behind it. "It is foreseeable that a number of different people working for government, from clerical staff to supervisors to colleagues, will move into an office, that is, enter an office, open a desk for a variety of reasons." When Justice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] challenged him as to whether employees in the private sector would have a reasonable expectation of privacy over their desks, he agreed that they might but reminded her the Fourth Amendment does not apply to private employers.&lt;ref name="Oral argument for petitioner" /&gt;  

He asked that the Court follow the logic of its 1985 ruling in ''[[New Jersey v. T. L. O.]]''&lt;ref name="NJ v. TLO"&gt;''[[New Jersey v. T. L. O.]]'', {{ussc|469|325|1985}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in which it had held that only a reasonable belief that evidence of misconduct would be found was needed to justify a search of a student or possessions on school property during school hours. Chief Justice [[William Rehnquist]] asked Miller if he was arguing the Fourth Amendment did not apply at all in schools. "it seems to me there is certainly language in ''T.L.O.'' against you on that point." That case, Miller responded, "had at least made the initial inquiry into whether the Fourth Amendment was applicable."&lt;ref name="Oral argument for petitioner" /&gt; 

The other justices were not convinced that Ortega's office had been entered for inventory purposes. They pointed to facts in the record they saw as being at odds with the state's interpretation. [[Antonin Scalia]] asked if it were possible that the Court could rule that it was an inventory but the actions taken had exceeded the scope of those necessary to accomplish that. Miller said that would be moot as there was no expectation of privacy over the desk and office. He further explained that Ortega's key may have given him a subjective expectation of privacy, but not necessarily a reasonable one. Miller admitted to [[Thurgood Marshall]] that he did not know why the inventory could not have been done in Ortega's presence to better facilitate the sorting of property.&lt;ref name="Oral argument for petitioner" /&gt;

He noted that most public agencies have an [[Inspector General]] or something similar, who "every now and then drops in on offices to see if employees have their own things in their office". When Justice [[Byron White]] asked if his position implied that a public agency could search its employees' desks or offices at any time of the day or night, he said yes. "It may give rise to work grievances, to state and common law tort remedies ... but it would not violate the Fourth Amendment in our view."&lt;ref name="Oral argument for petitioner" /&gt;

===Respondent's oral argument===

"Our argument rests on three propositions", Klein told the justices. "[F]irst, that it is both customary and reasonable for a public employee to keep personal papers and effects in his work office and to expect that the privacy of such materials will be protected against arbitrary searches or seizures by his employer; second, that the application of the Fourth Amendment to office searches is not incompatible with the government's responsibilities as an employer."&lt;ref name="Oral argument for respondent"&gt;{{cite web|title=Argument of Joel Klein|url=https://www.oyez.org/cases/1980-1989/1986/1986_85_530/argument|publisher=The Oyez Project|date=October 16, 1986|accessdate=January 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before he could get to the third, he was challenged by Scalia, who posited a situation where he might be working late and need to retrieve a document or file. He would find it on the desk of one of his [[List of law clerks of the Supreme Court of the United States|clerks]], who might have gone home for the day. "Now," he asked, "have I conducted a Fourth Amendment search and seizure, and I am only immune from ... suit because it was reasonable?&lt;ref name="Oral argument for respondent" /&gt;

Klein conceded to another justice's follow-up question that it was understood that, in all offices, "our expectation is, in the evenings, when people go home, others may on the basis of need enter ... The Fourth Amendment does not apply in most situations to a routine office entry, that is, if an employer or co-worker walks into your office looking for a paper clip." However, he said, that understanding did not defeat an expectation of privacy, likening it to a hotel room, where the Court had previously held there was an expectation of privacy even though hotel staff routinely enter for janitorial purposes. Scalia asked if it would be a Fourth Amendment violation if cleaning crews were to have looked through Ortega's desk and papers. "I don't think they would be exercising government authority in that situation", Klein answered, since the cleaning crews were presumably under instructions not to do so.&lt;ref name="Oral argument for respondent" /&gt;

O'Connor asked if it would be reasonable for a supervisor to enter an office and look through a desk to "discover whatever might be appropriate for work-related wrongdoing of some kind?" As an example, she suggested, a supervisor might want to assess an employee's progress toward a deadline. Klein did not think so, since normally such matters are handled by asking the employee to produce whatever work has been completed.&lt;ref name="Oral argument for respondent" /&gt;

To highlight his argument that the intrusion into Ortega's office had been a search rather than a property inventory, he used the example of the book of poetry, which was obviously personal property. "[I]f you pick up a book of poetry you don't have to open that book to find out who sent it to him." It was suggested that perhaps he read poetry to his patients, but Klein responded that the state had not suggested that and that, even if he did the book was still undeniably personal property.&lt;ref name="Oral argument for respondent" /&gt;

He, too, compared the case with ''T.L.O.'', telling Justice White that he believed a [[search warrant]] might have been necessary to enter Ortega's office in this situation. "[L]et me just say that I think that they were looking for information to use against him to take his job away from him. He had been singled out", Klein said. "[E]ven if you take the ''T.L.O.'' standard, it is inconceivable that we could have a lower standard at the work place than we have at the school given the interests of employees and their adult age ... [T]here has to be reasonable suspicion when you go in to do the search that you will uncover evidence." If the state or the hospital had really wanted the right to enter employees' offices, it could have followed the example of the [[United States Mint|Mint]] and the [[United States Customs Service|Customs Service]] and promulgated a regulation stating that employees' property could be subject to search.&lt;ref name="Oral argument for respondent" /&gt;

==Decision==

Five months later, in March 1987, the Court handed down its decision. All nine justices agreed that public employees had Fourth Amendment protections during administrative searches in the workplace, and that routine work-related intrusions as discussed at oral argument did not constitute a violation. They differed as to whether Ortega's had been breached by the search. The five-justice majority believed it could not determine the purpose of the intrusion into Ortega's office and so [[remand (court procedure)|remand]]ed the case to the district court to do so.

[[Sandra Day O'Connor|Justice O'Connor]] wrote for a four-justice [[plurality opinion|plurality]] that the same [[reasonable suspicion]] standard it developed for ''T.L.O.'' was applicable to administrative searches of public employees' workspace or possessions, since the "operational realities" of a public work environment may substantially reduce or eliminate a standard expectation of privacy. In a separate [[concurring opinion]], Justice Scalia rejected that as too vague to be useful to lower courts, and proposed instead that any search that would be reasonable for a private employer would be permissible for a public one.

[[Harry Blackmun|Justice Blackmun]] wrote for the four [[dissenting opinion|dissenting]] justices. He believed the majority had put too much weight on the different interpretations of the intrusion by the district and appellate courts, since he felt it was clearly an investigatory search for evidence against Dr. Ortega. Also, he charged, the majority had taken his concurrence in ''T.L.O.'' out of context to support its reasonableness standard. He did not feel, as they did, that outside of special cases such as the school system that it would have been detrimental to the operations of a public agency such as the hospital to have some sort of independent review and establish [[probable cause]] for an administrative search related to possible violations of policy.

===Plurality opinion===
After recounting the history of the case and the sweep of the Court's prior Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, O'Connor, joined by [[William Rehnquist|Chief Justice Rehnquist]], [[Byron White|Justice White]], and [[Lewis Franklin Powell, Jr.|Justice Powell]], defined the boundaries of the workplace context as "those areas and items that are related to work and are generally within the employer's control." Some items that passed through the workplace were personal, and as the Court had ruled in ''Mancusi'', a reasonable expectation of privacy may exist there. "[W]e reject the contention made by the Solicitor General and petitioners that public employees can never have a reasonable expectation of privacy in their place of work," she wrote. "Individuals do not lose Fourth Amendment rights merely because they work for the government, instead of a private employer."&lt;ref name="Majority opinion"&gt;''O'Connor v. Ortega'', {{ussc|480|709|1987}}, 712–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

She immediately qualified that holding.
{{blockquote|The operational realities of the workplace, however, may make some employees' expectations of privacy unreasonable when an intrusion is by a supervisor, rather than a law enforcement official. Public employees' expectations of privacy in their offices, desks, and file cabinets, like similar expectations of employees in the private sector, may be reduced by virtue of actual office practices and procedures, or by legitimate regulation ... An office is seldom a private enclave free from entry by supervisors, other employees, and business and personal invitees. Instead, in many cases offices are continually entered by fellow employees and other visitors during the workday for conferences, consultations, and other work-related visits. Simply put, it is the nature of government offices that others—such as fellow employees, supervisors, consensual visitors, and the general public—may have frequent access to an individual's office.&lt;ref name="Majority opinion 717"&gt;''O'Connor'', 480 U.S. at 717.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Moving from the general principle to the case at hand, O'Connor agreed that Ortega had that same reasonable expectation of privacy, but that since the record did not reflect the extent of whatever legitimate work-related reasons the hospital administrators might have had to enter the office, the Ninth Circuit should have remanded the case to the district court to determine that, as the majority was doing. Following ''T.L.O.'', she said the inquiry should not stop with determining the Fourth Amendment applied, but whether the context made the search reasonable. "We must balance the invasion of the employees' legitimate expectations of privacy  against the government's need for supervision, control, and the efficient operation of the workplace."&lt;ref name="Majority opinion 719–20"&gt;''O'Connor'', at 719–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

There was, O'Connor admitted, "surprisingly little [[case law]]" on the subject. That which existed did seem to support the standard she proposed for work-related searches, most notably a 1973 case from the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|Seventh Circuit]] in which the surreptitious recording of an [[Internal Revenue Service]]'s agent's conversations at his desk by the agency's internal investigators was held to be reasonable and work-related,&lt;ref name="Nasser cite"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=United States v. Nasser |vol=476 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=1111 |pinpoint=1123 |court=[[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|7th Cir.]] |date=1973 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/476/1111/323474/ |accessdate=2018-09-29 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a 1951 case from the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|District of Columbia]] which held that although a search of the appellee's desk by local police with her government supervisor's permission was unconstitutional, a work-related search by her supervisor would not have been.&lt;ref name="Blok cite"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=United States v. Blok |vol=188 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=1019 |pinpoint=1021 |court=D.C. Cir. |date=1951 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/188/1019/65788/ |accessdate=2018-09-29 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She distinguished these from other cases that proposed other standards for public workplace searches by noting that those cases were either not work-related or involved criminal misconduct.&lt;ref name="Majority opinion 721"&gt;''O'Connor'', 480 U.S. at 721.&lt;/ref&gt;

"In our view," O'Connor continued,
{{blockquote|requiring an employer to obtain a warrant whenever the employer wished to enter an employee's office, desk, or file cabinets for a work-related purpose would seriously disrupt the routine conduct of business and would be unduly burdensome. Imposing unwieldy warrant procedures in such cases upon supervisors, who would otherwise have no reason to be familiar with such procedures, is simply unreasonable.}}
She quoted from ''[[Connick v. Myers]]'', an earlier case which had considered the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights of an assistant prosecutor fired for allegedly disruptive behavior: "[G]overnment offices could not function if every employment decision became a constitutional matter."&lt;ref name="Majority opinion 722"&gt;''O'Connor'', 480 U.S. at 722.&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Connor announced that the Court would consider only the constitutionality of work-related and investigatory searches "and leave for another day inquiry into other circumstances." She found "the efficient and proper operation of the workplace" to similarly justify investigatory searches, since supervisors had different needs from [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]]. "The delay in correcting the employee misconduct caused by the need for probable cause, rather than reasonable suspicion, will be translated into tangible and often irreparable damage to the agency's work, and ultimately to the public interest." She again cited ''T.L.O.'' to justify this standard.&lt;ref name="Majority opinion 723–24"&gt;''O'Connor'', 480 U.S. at 723–24.&lt;/ref&gt; "Government offices are provided to employees for the sole purpose of facilitating the work of an agency. The employee may avoid exposing personal belongings at work by simply leaving them at home."&lt;ref name="Majority opinion 725"&gt;''O'Connor'', 480 U.S. at 725.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lastly O'Connor found the district court's finding on [[summary judgment]] that the intrusion was for the purposes of securing state property to be in error since there was a genuine dispute of fact. It followed then that the appellate court could not have made a definitive finding of fact either. The case was remanded to the district court with instructions to both determine what justified the search and seizure of Ortega's property and whether that search was reasonable in both its inception and scope.&lt;ref name="Majority opinion 726–29"&gt;''O'Connor'', 480 U.S. at 726–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scalia concurrence===
[[Antonin Scalia|Justice Scalia]] agreed that the case should be remanded, but felt it was not helpful to call for a case-by-case assessment, since it was difficult to make practical use of. He found fault with O'Connor's comment, justifying her "operating realities" test, that some public workplaces might be "so open" as to offer no reasonable expectation of privacy. "No clue is provided as to how open 'so open' must be; much less is it suggested how police officers are to gather the facts necessary for this refined inquiry ... [I]t is so devoid of content that it produces, rather than eliminates, uncertainty in this field."&lt;ref name="Scalia concurrence"&gt;''O'Connor'', 480 U.S. at 729–30 (Scalia, J., concurring).&lt;/ref&gt;

The plurality's standard could not be right if it led to a conclusion that the Fourth Amendment did not apply to a work-related entry into Ortega's office.
{{blockquote|It is privacy that is protected by the Fourth Amendment, not solitude. A man enjoys Fourth Amendment protection in his home, for example, even though his wife and children have the run of the place—and indeed, even though his landlord has the right to conduct unannounced inspections at any time.}}
Whether it was a supervisor or police officer entering the office, he said, only made a difference as to whether the search was reasonable, not whether the Fourth Amendment applies. When a firefighter enters a house where an alarm has gone off, he noted, "we do not ask whether the occupant has a reasonable expectation of privacy (and hence Fourth Amendment protection) vis-a-vis firemen, but rather whether—given the fact that the Fourth Amendment covers private dwellings—intrusion for the purpose of extinguishing a fire is reasonable",&lt;ref name="Scalia concurrence 731"&gt;''O'Connor'', 480 U.S. at 730–31 (Scalia, J., concurring).&lt;/ref&gt; citing the Court's ''[[Michigan v. Tyler]]'' ruling.&lt;ref name="Michigan v. Tyler"&gt;{{ussc|name=Michigan v. Tyler|436|499|1978}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;That case had dealt with Fourth Amendment rights during the subsequent investigations of the fire, not the firefighters' initial entry.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scalia argued that the offices and desks of public employees were covered by the Fourth Amendment as a general matter, choosing his words to avoid the ''Katz'' rule that places exposed to public view are not covered by the Fourth Amendment since some government offices, as O'Connor had noted, were subject to unrestricted public access. "Government searches to retrieve work-related materials or to investigate violations of workplace rules—searches of the sort that are regarded as reasonable and normal in the private employer context—do not violate the Fourth Amendment." Since the evidence in the case did not support a summary judgement, he joined his colleagues in ordering the case remanded.&lt;ref name="Scalia concurrence 731–32"&gt;''O'Connor'', at 731–32 (Scalia, J., concurring).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dissent===
At the outset of his dissent, signed by [[William J. Brennan, Jr.|Justices Brennan]], [[Thurgood Marshall|Marshall]] and [[John Paul Stevens|Stevens]], Justice Blackmun said "The facts of this case are simple and straightforward. Dr. Ortega had an expectation of privacy in his office, desk, and file cabinets, which were the target of a search by petitioners that can be characterized only as investigatory in nature." He disagreed with the plurality that there was anything special about a public workplace that justified a lower standard for such searches, and called the intrusion an unconstitutional search. Not only had it found what were to him clear facts in dispute,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;In his footnote 3, Blackmun accused the plurality of letting its opinion on this issue be shaped by its members' antipathy to public workers.&lt;/ref&gt; it had nevertheless chosen to derive a standard from a case it had remanded to resolve that dispute. "As a result, the standard that emerges makes reasonable almost any workplace search by a public employer."&lt;ref name="Blackmun dissent"&gt;''O'Connor'', 480 U.S. at 732–34 (Blackmun, J., dissenting).&lt;/ref&gt;

As to the facts, Blackmun contended the plurality had been confused, partially relying on Ortega's removal of the computer as a reason to consider the intrusion reasonable when, he noted, the record itself had testimony from Friday that this had ''not'' triggered the search. Dr. O'Connor had further admitted in his [[deposition (law)|deposition]] that there was an investigatory interest in the contents of Ortega's office. The searchers had also consulted with a lawyer and waited until the evening. "The search in question stemmed neither from a Hospital policy nor from a practice of routine entrances into Dr. Ortega's office", he wrote. "It was plainly exceptional and investigatory in nature. Accordingly, there is no significant factual dispute in this case."&lt;ref name="Blackmun dissent 735–6"&gt;''O'Connor'', 480 U.S. at 735–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Blackmun began his disagreement with the plurality's embrace of the [[reasonable suspicion]] standard by agreeing with it that government employees retained their Fourth Amendment rights at work. He accepted as well that routine work-related intrusions might diminish their expectation of privacy. He did not accept that such intrusions would eliminate it.&lt;ref name="Blackmun dissent 737"&gt;''O'Connor'', 480 U.S. at 737.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court had always recognized Fourth Amendment rights in offices, he said, despite the understanding that it would be visited by others. The plurality did recognize, he conceded, another point: that a search unreasonable in one context might be reasonable in another.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;In his footnote 2, Blackmun responded to Scalia's criticism by quoting from other opinions, most by his fellow dissenters, to the effect that a case-by-case analysis might be the only way to create effective Fourth Amendment jurisprudence&lt;/ref&gt; But
{{blockquote|[...] the reality of work in modern time, whether done by public or private employees, reveals why a public employee's expectation of privacy in the workplace should be carefully safeguarded and not lightly set aside. It is, unfortunately, all too true that the workplace has become another home for most working Americans. Many employees spend the better part of their days and much of their evenings at work. [...] As a result, the tidy distinctions (to which the plurality alludes) between the workplace and professional affairs, on the one hand, and personal possessions and private activities, on the other, do not exist in reality. Thus, the plurality's remark that the "employee may avoid exposing personal belongings at work by simply leaving them at home," reveals on [their part] a certain insensitivity to the "operational realities of the workplace"&lt;ref&gt;''O'Connor'', 480 U.S. at 738–39.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Thus he thought it especially important that the context of the search be considered.&lt;ref name="Blackmun dissent 739–40"&gt;''O'Connor'', 480 U.S. at 739–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice Blackmun reminded the plurality that his concurring opinion in ''T.L.O.'', from which Justice O'Connor had drawn support for her "special need" argument, was meant to address an error he believed that case's plurality had made. The balancing test he had proposed there was not needed here, since "[t]here was no special practical need that might have justified dispensing with the warrant and probable cause requirements." The time and effort required to get a warrant, he said, would not have detracted from the hospital's mission of providing quality patient care and educating new psychiatrists. An independent review by a [[magistrate]] might, he added, have helped make the search not only constitutional but more efficient, since they would have been forced to list and justify every aspect of the office and desk they wished to look through.&lt;ref name="Blackmun dissent 741–42"&gt;''O'Connor'', 480 U.S. at 741–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

And even if there were a special need, the balancing test would still not be necessary.
{{blockquote|It is certainly correct that a public employer cannot be expected to obtain a warrant for every routine entry into an employee's workplace. This situation, however, should not justify dispensing with a warrant in all searches by the employer. The warrant requirement is perfectly suited for many work-related searches, including the instant one.}}
Despite claiming to have drawn well-defined standards from the facts of the case, the two categories of searches it had approved as not requiring warrants, they were, Blackmun felt, so broadly drawn that "it is difficult to imagine a search that would not fit into one or the other ..."&lt;ref name="Blackmun dissent 745–46"&gt;''O'Connor'', 480 U.S. at 745–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==
The case was closely watched by the parties to ''[[National Treasury Employees Union v. Von Raab]]'', then on appeal to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit|Fifth Circuit]] and seen as likely to reach the Supreme Court (as it eventually did). It involved a challenge by employees of the [[United States Customs Service]] to a proposal by the agency that employees in certain positions submit to mandatory [[drug testing]]. The employees' union had sued to block it, arguing it was a violation of their Fourth Amendment protections.&lt;ref name="NYT reaction story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Taylor, Jr.|first=Stuart|authorlink=Stuart Taylor, Jr.|title=Court Backs Wide Searches by Public Employers|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/01/us/court-backs-wide-searches-by-public-employers.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 1, 1987|accessdate=January 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The union and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], which had also filed an ''amicus'' brief urging affirmance in ''O'Connor'', praised the court's holding that public employees had Fourth Amendment rights in the workplace. They said it made their arguments in ''Von Raab'' stronger. The [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] maintained that it still believed the Customs Service's drug testing requirement would be held constitutional.&lt;ref name="NYT reaction story" /&gt;

==Disposition==
Within two months of the Court's decision the Ninth Circuit formally remanded it to the district court.&lt;ref name="Ninth Circuit remand"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Ortega v. O'Connor |vol=817 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=1408 |pinpoint= |court=9th Cir. |date=1987 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/817/1408/467688/ |accessdate=2018-09-29 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new trial was held five years later, in 1992, again before Judge Vukasin. Dr. Ortega once again had to represent himself,&lt;ref name="1998 appellate decision" /&gt; and when the defense failed to receive his witness list the court [[sanctions (law)|sanctioned]] him by refusing to allow him to present them. As a result he was largely limited to [[cross-examination|cross-examining]] the opposing witnesses, and when the defense was done presenting its case the court granted its motion for a [[directed verdict]].&lt;ref name="1995 appeal"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Ortega v. O'Connor |vol=50 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=778 |pinpoint= |court=9th Cir. |date=1995 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/50/778/542889/ |accessdate=2018-09-29 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ortega appealed to the Ninth Circuit again, retaining his lawyer to do so. He challenged not only the sanctioning but the trial court's refusal to let him include Asher Rubin as a defendant. In late 1994 a three-judge panel heard the case; it announced its decision five months later.&lt;ref name="1995 appeal" /&gt;

Circuit judge [[Diarmuid O'Scannlain]] wrote for a unanimous panel that the sanctions, while within limits of judicial discretion, had so adversely affected Ortega's case that the verdict was tainted. Reduced to merely cross-examining opposing witnesses, he could not present his own case-in-chief. And, further, they were unjustified as the trial record included a letter from Ortega to Paul Hammerness, the assistant attorney general handling the case, referring to "the enclosed witness list", that had been stamped as received by the court in November 1992.&lt;ref name="1995 appeal" /&gt;

"The court appears to have overlooked this evidence of Dr. Ortega's compliance", O'Scannlain wrote. "Dr. Ortega's compliance is not negated by the fact that opposing counsel failed to receive the list." Therefore, the sanctions against his witnesses had clearly been erroneous. The panel then affirmed the district court on its denial of the additional defendant, as the district court that had first heard the case dismissed that defendant on [[prosecutorial immunity]] grounds. Had Ortega wished to challenge that holding, the panel said, he had to have done so on his original appeal to the Ninth Circuit.&lt;ref name="1995 appeal" /&gt;

On remand, O'Connor and Friday, the only defendants left, changed their strategy and asserted [[qualified immunity]],&lt;ref group="note"&gt;[[Qualified immunity]] bars suits against those acting under [[color (law)|color of law]] for actions that might have been illegal, or were later prohibited, but for which there was a lack of settled law at the time.&lt;/ref&gt; for the first time, dropping their claim that the need to secure or inventory state property justified their intrusion. Instead, they said, the claims of misconduct, particularly the alleged [[sexual harassment]], made it necessary. During pretrial motions, Judge [[Marilyn Hall Patel]], who took over the case since Vukasin had died, barred the use of qualified immunity and ruled that sexual harassment could not have justified the search. As a result both parties agreed not to introduce the book of poetry, photo and Valentine.&lt;ref name="1998 appellate decision" /&gt;

A jury found for Ortega on all his claims. It awarded him $376,000 in compensatory damages, and $35,000 and $25,000 respectively against O'Connor and Friday respectively. Afterward, the district court awarded almost $32,000 in attorney's fees.&lt;ref name="Graham v. Ortega"&gt;''[http://ca.findacase.com/research/wfrmDocViewer.aspx/xq/fac.%5CSAC%5CCA%5C2001%5C20011108_0002070.CA.htm/qx Graham v. Ortega]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}'' (Cal. Ct. App.) (unpublished).&lt;/ref&gt; O'Connor and Friday appealed.&lt;ref name="1998 appellate decision" /&gt;

A three-judge panel, including two of the judges who had been on the 1985 panel, found Patel's rulings on qualified immunity and the sexual harassment claims worthy of consideration. [[Stephen Reinhardt]], one of those original judges, noted that Judge Vukasin had rejected the qualified immunuity defense at the first trial and that the [[jury instructions]] Patel and both sides had approved made such a defense possible even if the exact words "qualified immunity" were not used. Nor were the defendants correct in arguing that there was no settled law before the Supreme Court's ruling. "[I]t was clearly established in 1981 that, in the absence of an accepted practice or regulation to the contrary, government employees such as Dr. Ortega had a reasonable expectation of privacy in their private offices, desks, and file cabinets, thereby triggering the protections of the Fourth Amendment with regard to searches and seizures", Reinhardt wrote. He quoted explicit language to that effect from the Supreme Court's 1966 holding in ''[[Hoffa v. United States]]''&lt;ref name="Hoffa v. United States cite"&gt;{{ussc|name=Hoffa v. United States|385|293|1966}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and noted the Supreme Court plurality's citation of existing lower-court holdings saying the same thing.&lt;ref name="1998 appellate decision" /&gt; Even if it had not been, it was not "reasonable under the circumstances", as ''[[Terry v. Ohio]]''&lt;ref name="Terry v. Ohio cite"&gt;{{ussc|name=Terry v. Ohio|392|1|1968}}.&lt;/ref&gt; required.
{{blockquote|Neither this court, nor any other court had, as of 1981, ever suggested that a general or indiscriminate workplace search, or a workplace search not reasonably related to work itself or to specific work related misconduct, would be constitutional, unless the individual had consented to such a search as a condition of employment ... The defendants, therefore, could not have prevailed on their qualified immunity defense under any set of lawful qualified immunity instructions.&lt;ref name="1998 appellate decision" /&gt;}}

O'Connor and Friday had argued that, by denying them the opportunity to raise the sexual harassment claims as a justification for the search, Patel had improperly granted what amounted to ''[[sua sponte]]'' partial summary judgement against them. Reinhardt countered that they had had adequate time to develop their defense and so the judge was "procedurally free" to do that. He turned to whether such a ruling was justified and not an abuse of discretion. Even if he resolved an issue of disputed fact in their favor and assumed that O'Connor and Friday knew of the sexual harassment allegations before they went into Ortega's office, the allegations themselves were  vague, and one of them was ten years old. Thus, he continued, they did not create a reasonable suspicion that he was harassing residents, and even if they did they could not have reasonably established a likelihood that evidence supporting them would be found there. "The search was, at best, a general and unbounded pursuit of anything that might tend to indicate any sort of malfeasance—a search that is almost by definition, unreasonable." It had also been properly excluded since its prejudicial value outweighed its probative value.&lt;ref name="1998 appellate decision" /&gt;

"It is now seventeen years since the search of Dr. Ortega's office occurred and his most personal letters and possessions were examined and seized. It is time to bring this matter to a conclusion", wrote Reinhardt. He dismissed the remaining grounds for appeal as meritless, and the panel unanimously upheld the district court.&lt;ref name="1998 appellate decision" /&gt; The appellate decision was not further appealed. 

After the state paid his claim, amounting to over $700,000 with [[interest]], Dr. Ortega was sued by one of his former attorneys for unpaid bills. The two settled the claim in [[arbitration in the United States|arbitration]], but after Ortega refused to comply, the attorney sued him and won an adjustment to the arbitration award correcting some errors made in calculating the interest rate. A state appellate court upheld the trial court verdict in 2001, saying Ortega's "often rambling and incoherent narratives" in briefs he wrote himself left them with little in the way of substantive legal argument.&lt;ref name="Graham v. Ortega" /&gt; Ortega died in 2009.&lt;ref name="Ortega obit"&gt;{{cite news|title=Dr. Magno Ortega|url=http://napavalleyregister.com/news/local/obituaries/article_2ff04582-fa45-5d7f-8a44-1099ff64e6c1.html|accessdate=January 29, 2011|newspaper=[[Napa Valley Register]]|publisher=[[Lee Enterprises]]|location=[[Napa, California|Napa, CA]]|date=September 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent jurisprudence==
The first case after ''O'Connor'' to involve the Fourth Amendment rights of government employees at work was, as expected, ''[[National Treasury Employees Union v. Von Raab]]''. A 5-4 majority held that the [[urine testing]] the [[United States Customs Service|Customs Service]] proposed for internal promotion to positions involving [[drug interdiction]], carrying firearms or handling classified material was reasonable since it was "not designed to serve the ordinary needs of law enforcement."&lt;ref name="Von Raab cite"&gt;''[[National Treasury Employees Union v. Von Raab]]'', {{ussc|489|656|1989}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Scalia, in a dissent joined by Stevens, called the program "a kind of immolation of privacy and human dignity in symbolic opposition to drug use". The Customs Service, he said, had not introduced "real evidence of a real problem that will be solved by urine testing."&lt;ref name="Scalia Von Raab dissent"&gt;''Von Raab'', 489 U.S. at 681, Scalia, J., dissenting.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, when turning down a 1997 challenge by employees of [[Puerto Rico Telephone]] to a proposed [[video surveillance]] plan, Judge [[Bruce M. Selya]] of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit|First Circuit]] called ''O'Connor'' "[t]he watershed case in this enclave of Fourth Amendment jurisprudence".&lt;ref name="Vega-Rodriguez cite"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Vega-Rodriguez v. Puerto Rico Telephone Co. |vol=110 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=174 |pinpoint= |court=[[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit|1st Cir.]] |date=1997 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/110/174/527002/ |accessdate=2018-09-29 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His opinion surveyed a number of other district and circuit cases considering the "operating realities" of public workplaces to establish whether a legitimate expectation of privacy existed. 

A key issue was whether the workplace or portion in question was reserved for the employee's personal use. A judge in the [[United States District Court for the District of Kansas|District of Kansas]] had granted summary judgement to [[Johnson County Community College]] against its security guards who challenged its video surveillance of their locker room by noting that the locker area under view was not exclusive to any of them.&lt;ref name="JCCC v.

In a New York case that echoed Scalia's questions to Klein at oral argument, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second Circuit]] found it reasonable for a judge to have court officers seize the  contents of his just-fired law clerk's desk since the relationship between the two required free and complete access to each other's papers.&lt;ref name="Sheppard v.

===''Ontario v. Quon''===
{{main|Ontario v. Quon}}
As Ortega's dispute with his lawyer was coming to an end, elsewhere in California the events were unfolding that would lead to the next case where the Court would consider the Fourth Amendment rights of public employees during administrative investigations. In 2000 the city of [[Ontario, California|Ontario]] purchased 20 [[alphanumeric paging|alphanumeric pagers]] for its police department [[SWAT]] team to carry on and off-duty. A department policy, never put in writing, said that "light personal use" was permitted but that the pager messages could be audited at any time.

Several officers routinely exceeded the monthly [[character (computing)|character]] limit. The lieutenant in charge of the pagers at first allowed them to reimburse the city for the overage fees in exchange for not auditing the messages. Later, when he was "tired of being a bill collector", he and his superiors decided to audit the [[text message]]s to see if the character limit was too low.

Transcripts of the pager messages, redacted to include those sent only during work hours, showed that many of them were not work-related, and some were [[sexting|sexually explicit]]. Two officers were disciplined. Afterwards, they sued the superior officers, the department, the city and the pager provider for violation of the [[Stored Communications Act]] and their Fourth Amendment rights. The district court held a jury trial, which determined the audit was work-related, and it ruled for the defendants.

On appeal the Ninth Circuit reversed, calling the audit an unreasonable search.&lt;ref name="Quon v. Arch Wireless"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Quon v. Arch Wireless |vol=529 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=892 |pinpoint= |court=9th Cir. |date=2008 |url=https://www.leagle.com/decision/20081421529f3d89211341 |accessdate=2018-09-29 |quote=}}'''',  ( 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; After being denied their petition for an ''[[en banc]]'' rehearing, the defendants successfully petitioned the Supreme Court for ''[[certiorari]]''.&lt;ref name="Quon cert granted"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/121409zor.pdf |title=Order list; December 14, 2009 }}; U.S. Supreme Court.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court would only consider the Fourth Amendment claim, so the wireless provider was dropped as a petitioner there.

The case received much attention since it also was [[first impression (law)|the first time]] the Court had considered Fourth Amendment rights in the rapidly expanding area of electronic telecommunications.&lt;ref name="NYT Quon cert grant story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Liptak|first=Adam|authorlink=Adam Liptak|title=Supreme Court Takes Texting Case|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/15/us/15scotus.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 15, 2009|accessdate=November 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only Scalia and Stevens remained from the ''O'Connor'' court. As a result, it was also seen as a possible chance to resolve the conflict between the plurality's "operating realities" standard and Scalia's.&lt;ref name="Orin Kerr Quon post"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kerr|first=Orin|title=Will the Supreme Court Rethink Public Employee Privacy Rights in Quon?|url=http://volokh.com/2009/12/14/will-the-supreme-court-rethink-public-employee-privacy-rights-in-quon/|publisher=[[Eugene Volokh]]|work=[[The Volokh Conspiracy]]|date=December 14, 2009|accessdate=January 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2010, the Court unanimously upheld the search. Instead of choosing one of the ''O'Connor'' standards, it applied them both. [[Anthony Kennedy]] wrote for a seven-justice [[majority opinion|majority]] that since the audit had had a legitimate work-related purpose and its scope was limited to the pager messages sent at work, it was reasonable enough for the plurality in that case, and it would have been reasonable for a private-sector employer as Scalia had proposed.

Stevens and Scalia both wrote separate concurring opinions. The former felt that, under the case-by-case approach Blackmun had advocated in his ''O'Connor'' dissent, Quon in this case knew or should have known all his communications could have come under public scrutiny. Scalia's opinion of the "operational realities" test remained unchanged. He called it "standardless and unsupported" and said the ''Quon'' majority "underscores the unworkability of that standard".

==Analysis and commentary==

When considering what approach the Court would take in ''Quon'', [[George Washington University Law School|George Washington University law professor]] [[Orin Kerr]], a Fourth Amendment scholar, noted that courts have generally used the plurality standard from ''O'Connor''. "Exactly how you get there is sort of tricky, though", he commented. "So courts have mostly just figured that four Justices is more than one and that they should follow the analysis in the concurring opinion."&lt;ref name="Orin Kerr Quon post" /&gt;

O'Connor biographer Ann Cary McFeatters writes that her and Scalia's separate opinions in this case were the first of many clashes between the two justices in their joint tenure on the Court. "It would not be the last time Scalia went after her with verbal venom. It would not be the last time his doctrinaire certitude conflicted with her case-by-case approach."&lt;ref name="McFeatters book"&gt;{{cite book|last=McFeatters|first=Ann Carey|title=Sandra Day O'Connor: Justice in the Balance|year=2005|publisher=[[University of New Mexico Press|UNM Press]]|location=[[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque, NM]]|isbn=978-0-8263-3218-9|pages=162|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dewgAvJuWlMC&amp;pg=PA162&amp;dq=%22O%27connor+v.+Ortega%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=nBZGTeztIMSdgQes8aiHAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22O%27connor%20v.%20Ortega%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Child soldiers}}
The '''Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict''' (OPAC), also known as the [[Children in the military|child soldier]] treaty, is a [[multilateral treaty]] whereby states agree to: 1) prohibit the [[Military use of children|conscription into the military of children]] under the age of 18; 2) ensure that military recruits are no younger than 16; and 3) prevent recruits aged 16 or 17 from taking a direct part in hostilities. The treaty also forbids [[Violent non-state actor|non-state armed groups]] from recruiting anyone under the age of 18 for any purpose.

The [[United Nations General Assembly]] adopted the treaty as a supplementary protocol to the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] by [[United Nations General Assembly resolution|resolution]] 54/263 on 25 May 2000.&lt;ref name="UN_ARES54263"&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-RES-54-263 |type=Resolution |body=General Assembly |session=54 |resolution_number=263 |accessdate=20 July 2008|title=Optional protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict and on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography|date=25 May 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protocol came into force on 12 February 2002.

As of September 2018, 168 states are party to the protocol and a further 13 states have signed but not ratified it.&lt;ref name="untreaty"&gt;{{Cite web

== Background ==
{{Main|Children in the military}}
The [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] (1989) defines a child as any person under the age of 18.

Throughout history and in many cultures, children have been extensively involved in military campaigns.&lt;ref name="Wessells"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wessels|first1=Michael|date=1997|title=Child Soldiers|journal=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|volume=53|issue=4|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[World War I]], in Great Britain 250,000 boys under 18 managed to join the army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/guides/zcvdhyc|title=How did Britain let 250000 underage soldiers fight in WW1?|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[World War II]], child soldiers fought throughout Europe, in the [[Warsaw Uprising]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Norman Davies]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=Jzxt9FFBDPwC&amp;pg=PA603 ''Rising '44: The Battle for Warsaw,''] Pan Books 2004 p.603&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Jewish resistance in German-occupied Europe|Jewish resistance]],&lt;ref name="Rosen2005"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zQYQ0tho6mAC&amp;pg=PA55|title=Armies of the Young: Child Soldiers in War and Terrorism|author=David M.

Progress towards ending the use of children for military purposes has been slow, partly because many national armed forces have relied on children to fill their ranks.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.child-soldiers.org/where-are-there-child-soldiers|title=Where are child soldiers?|last=Child Soldiers International|first=|date=2017|work=|access-date=2018-01-25|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.child-soldiers.org/Handlers/Download.ashx?IDMF=da92581e-7130-40e6-bf3a-a86b944f17dd|title=Louder than words: An agenda for action to end state use of child soldiers|last=Child Soldiers International|first=|date=2012|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Initial efforts to limit the participation of children in armed conflict began with the adoption of the Additional Protocols to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, adopted in 1977 (Art. 77.2).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icrc.org/eng/assets/files/other/icrc_002_0321.pdf|title=Protocols additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949|last=International Committee of the Red Cross|first=|date=1977|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new Protocols prohibited the [[military recruitment]] of children aged under 15 and their direct participation in hostilities, but continued to allow state [[Military|armed forces]] and [[Violent non-state actor|non-state armed groups]] to recruit children from age 15 and use them in warfare.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/470-750099?OpenDocument ICRC Commentary on Protocol I: Article 77] website of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross|ICRC]] ¶ 3183–3191 also ¶ [http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/470-750098?OpenDocument 3171]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Protocols did not prohibit belligerents from using children younger than 15 in hostilities when their participation was not "direct"; for example, as scouts, porters, informants, spies, message-carriers and in other support roles.

When the same limited standards were incorporated into the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] (CRC) in 1989, children's rights advocates were left frustrated, believing that a treaty establishing the fundamental rights of children ought to protect them from all forms of military involvement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; To achieve this, a small group of human rights campaigners and sympathetic governments began a global campaign for a new treaty, which was adopted in 2000 as the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict (OPAC).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== The campaign for a new treaty ==

=== Initial negotiations ===
By 1994, five years after the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] was adopted, children's rights advocates and sympathetic governments had persuaded the international community to establish a working group of the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ichrp.org/files/papers/88/120B_-_Optional_Protocol_to_the_Convention_on_the_Rights_of_the_Child_Brett__Rachel__2005.pdf|title=Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict (OP/CAC)|last=Brett|first=R|date=2005|website=International Council on Human Rights Policy &amp; International Commission of Jurists|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its mandate was to begin negotiations on a new protocol to the Convention that would raise standards regarding the use of children for military purposes.

While the large majority of states negotiating the protocol were willing to end all military recruitment of children under the age of 18 (the so-called "straight-18" principle), a small number were opposed: [[Bangladesh]], [[Cuba]], [[Israel]], [[South Korea]], [[Kuwait]], [[Pakistan]], the [[United Kingdom]] (UK) and the [[United States]] (US). According to Jo Becker, a human rights advocate actively involved in the negotiations:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Governments began a series of annual negotiations in [[Geneva]], but by 1998, negotiations floundered as it became clear that governments that had long used under-eighteens in their national armed forces, notably the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]], were not willing to support a new standard that conflicted with their national practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/837635842|title=Campaigning for justice: Human rights advocacy in practice|last=Becker|first=J|date=|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=2013|isbn=9780804774512|location=Stanford, California|pages=14|oclc=837635842}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While some of the states opposed to the change said nevertheless that they would not block it, the US insisted on its position, according to Becker.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Instrumental in gathering high-level support for the treaty was a proposal by children's rights advocates for a major study on the effect of armed conflict on children.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The study was proposed by the [[Committee on the Rights of the Child]], commissioned by the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]], and produced by [[Graça Machel]] in 1996: ''Impact of armed conflict on children''.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicef.org/graca/a51-306_en.pdf|title=Impact of armed conflict on children|last=Machel|first=G|date=1996|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report was particularly concerned with the use of younger children as participants in [[War|armed conflict]], presenting evidence that many thousands of children were being killed, maimed, and [[Mental disorder|psychiatrically injured]] around the world every year. It also called for an end to the recruitment of children by all armed forces.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

=== The Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers ===
As negotiations on the new treaty stalled in 1998, the [[Child Soldiers International|Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers]] (now known as [[Child Soldiers International]]) was established by six human rights and humanitarian organizations ([[Amnesty International]], [[Human Rights Watch]], [[Terre des hommes|International Federation Terre des Hommes]], [[Jesuit Refugee Service]], the [[Quaker United Nations Office|Quaker United Nations Office (Geneva)]] and [[Save the Children]]).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With the goal of incorporating the straight-18 principle into the new treaty, the Coalition quickly seeded national affiliates in more than thirty countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Coalition worked in alliance with a small group of states actively advocating for the straight-18 principle internationally: [[Canada]], [[Denmark]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Finland]], [[Japan]], [[Mozambique]], [[Norway]], [[Portugal]], [[South Africa]], [[Sweden]], and [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

With initial funding from the [[Canada|Canadian]] government, the Coalition organised a series of intergovernmental regional conferences; the African and Latin-American conferences strongly supported the straight-18 principle.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The European conference supported an end to the participation of children in armed conflict, but not their recruitment, due to opposition from [[Austria]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Luxembourg]], the [[Netherlands]] and the [[United Kingdom|UK]], which were all recruiting children aged 16 or 17 into their own armed forces.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; (As of 2017, all except Luxembourg were still doing so.)&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

By 1999, the straight-18 principle enjoyed the support of the large majority of states, as well as the [[Committee on the Rights of the Child]], the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]], the [[International Labour Organization]], the [[European Parliament]], the [[Organisation of African Unity|Organization of African Unity]], and the [[World Council of Churches]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Final negotiations ===
In the final negotiations, only five states still advocated against the straight-18 principle: [[Egypt]], [[Kuwait]], [[Singapore]], the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and, most trenchantly, the [[United States|US]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/15/world/us-fights-tide-on-a-move-to-raise-the-military-service-age.html|title=U.S. Fights Tide on a Move to Raise the Military Service Age|last=Olson|first=Elizabeth|date=2000|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-02-04|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US, with British support, continued to insist that it would not support a treaty that prevented it from sending 17 year-olds into battle.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; According to Becker, the US relented following an intervention from [[Secretary of state (U.S. state government)|Secretary of State]] [[Madeleine Albright]], although the US and UK continued to insist on their right to recruit children from age 16 (UK) and 17 (US).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

This change allowed a compromise [[Consensus decision-making|consensus]] between the negotiating parties, in which the new treaty would not prevent states from recruiting children into their armed forces from age 16 or 17, but would require that "all feasible measures" be taken to ensure that children did not participate "directly" in hostilities.

=== Extent of ratification and the straight-18 position ===
The OPAC treaty has been widely ratified. As of February 2018, 167 states had ratified or acceded to the treaty; a further 13 states had signed but not yet ratified it.&lt;ref name="untreaty" /&gt;

In addition, following OPAC's adoption the number of states restricting enlistment to adults aged over 18 has increased substantially, according to [[Child Soldiers International]]: from 83 in 2001 to 126 in 2016, which is 71 percent of countries with armed forces.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; These include several states where child recruitment had been routine, including [[Colombia]] and [[Sierra Leone]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Approximately 60 [[Violent non-state actor|non-state armed groups]] have also entered agreements to stop or scale back their use of children.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.child-soldiers.org/Handlers/Download.ashx?IDMF=38e90749-3a76-4441-82dc-bd49f1217599|title=A law unto themselves? Confronting the recruitment of children by armed groups|last=Child Soldiers International|first=|date=2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this trend, [[Child Soldiers International]] reports that the recruitment of children for military purposes remains widespread, including by armed forces in the three most populous countries – [[China]], [[India]] and the [[United States]] – and the most economically powerful (all [[Group of Seven|G7 countries]] apart from [[Italy]] and [[Japan]]).&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt; A large number of [[Violent non-state actor|non-state armed groups]] also recruit and use children routinely, especially following a recent surge in child recruitment by militant [[Islamism|Islamist]] movements in [[Africa]] and the [[Middle East]], as well as by militias opposing them.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/2017/821&amp;Lang=E&amp;Area=UNDOC|title=Report of the Secretary-General: Children and armed conflict, 2017|last=United Nations Secretary-General|first=|date=2017|website=www.un.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 February 2018 a meeting was held at the UN to mark the treaty's 18th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.child-soldiers.org/news/opac-turns-18|title=OPAC Turns 18 a great success at the UN|last=Child Soldiers International|first=|date=2018|work=|access-date=2018-03-24|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meeting, co-sponsored by Child Soldiers International, UNICEF, and the governments of Belgium, Canada, Colombia, France and Sierra Leone, was attended by approximately 100 delegates. The Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict, [[Virginia Gamba (born 1954)|Virginia Gamba]], reported on the progress made and still to be achieved since the treaty was adopted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We have really come a long way. Today, 18 years later, we should celebrate the quantifiable progress accomplished. The issue of children and armed conflict has been squarely placed on the international peace and security agenda. Since 2000, at least 130,000 child soldiers were released due to the collective efforts of child protection actors. Thousands more were spared the ordeal of recruitment and use – because their country has joined OPAC and put in place measures to protect them. Making sure all boys and girls released and their communities have access to meaningful reintegration – to help them overcome the harrowing experiences they have been through – is essential. But this remains a huge challenge.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;

== Provisions of the OPAC treaty ==

=== Main obligations ===
The main obligations of the OPAC treaty are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/OPACCRC.aspx|title=Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child|last=Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights|first=|date=2000|website=www.ohchr.org|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* No state party may recruit any person who has yet to attain a minimum age specified by the state (in a binding declaration deposited with the UN on ratification), and in all cases the minimum age must not be lower than 16 years.
* States parties whose armed forces recruit children aged 16 or 17 must:
** not compel children to join their armed forces;
** ensure that "reliable proof of age" is provided before enlistment;
** ensure prior to enlistment that child applicants are "fully informed" of the duties of military service, that their choice to enlist is "genuinely voluntary", and that their parents or legal guardians give their "informed consent"; and
** "take all feasible measures" to ensure that child recruits do not take part directly in hostilities;
* [[Violent non-state actor|Non-state armed groups]] "should not, under any circumstances, recruit or use in hostilities" any child under the age of 18 (the legal force of this is uncertain, however&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://genevacall.org/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/2013/12/Engaging-Nonstate-Armed-Groups-on-the-Protection-of-Children-Towards-Strategic-Complementarity-International-Peace-Institute..pdf|title=Engaging nonstate armed groups on the protection of children: Towards strategic complementarity|last=Geneva Call|first=|date=2012|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":42"/&gt;).
* States parties to the treaty must report periodically on its implementation to the [[Committee on the Rights of the Child]].

=== Other provisions ===
Other provisions of the treaty include the following:
* States parties must cooperate with each other in the implementation of the treaty and support financially and technically "in the rehabilitation and social reintegration" of persons who were recruited unlawfully as children.
* Any state can leave the treaty at a year's notice, but not if engaged in armed conflict at the time.
* The treaty does not prevent states from operating military schools, which are common in many countries,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; provided that these comply with the legal requirements governing education in the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]].
* The treaty allows states the option of raising their minimum enlistment age at any point and depositing an updated binding declaration to that effect with the United Nations; any state doing so is then bound by the revised minimum age and may not lower it.

== Commentary of the International Committee of the Red Cross ==
The sentence "States Parties shall take all feasible measures to ensure that members of their armed forces who have not attained the age of 18 years do not take a direct part in hostilities" was adapted from Article 77.2 of the Additional [[Protocol I]] to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts, adopted in 1977, with an alteration from fifteen years to eighteen years and some other minor modifications. ("The Parties to the conflict shall take all feasible measures in order that children who have not attained the age of fifteen years do not take a direct part in hostilities and, in particular, they shall refrain from recruiting them into their armed forces.")

The ICRC commentary on Protocol I makes clear that it does not require a complete ban on the use of children in conflict. The ICRC had proposed that the Protocol require parties to "take all ''necessary'' measures" but final text uses the wording "take all ''feasible'' measures" which is not a total prohibition on their doing so. Furthermore, refraining from recruiting children under fifteen does not exclude children who volunteer for armed service. During the negotiations over the clause "take a part in hostilities," the word "direct" was added, opening up the possibility that child volunteers could be involved indirectly in hostilities, gathering and transmitting military information, helping in the transportation of arms and munitions, provision of supplies, etc.&lt;ref name=":10"/&gt;

==National responses==

=== Australia ===
The [[Australian Defence Force Cadets]] follows the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-06-17|title=Australian Defence Force Cadets|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Australian_Defence_Force_Cadets&amp;oldid=786140026|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; but still accepts cadets between the ages of 13–18 (except staff) and sometimes brings them onto ADF bases.

=== United Kingdom ===
{{Main|Selection and Training in the British Army}}

As noted above, at the time of OPAC's negotiation, the UK joined the US in actively resisting the majority view of negotiating states that 18 should be the minimum age for all forms of military recruitment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Then, as now, the UK permits its armed forces to enlist from age 16, and allows children to apply aged 15 years, 7 months.&lt;ref name=":102"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gee|first=David|last2=Taylor|first2=Rachel|date=2016-11-01|title=Is it Counterproductive to Enlist Minors into the Army?|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/03071847.2016.1265837|journal=The RUSI Journal|volume=161|issue=6|pages=36–48|doi=10.1080/03071847.2016.1265837|issn=0307-1847}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://apply.army.mod.uk/how-to-join/can-i-join/age|title=Age|last=British Army|first=|date=2018|website=mod.uk|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On ratification of the treaty, the UK's binding declaration stated its understanding that, while it would endeavour not to use child recruits in hostilities, the protocol "...would not exclude the deployment of members of its armed forces under the age of 18 to take a direct part in hostilities where: a) there is a genuine military need to deploy their unit or ship to an area in which hostilities are taking place; and b) by reason of the nature and urgency of the situation:- i) it is not practicable to withdraw such persons before deployment; or ii) to do so would undermine the operational effectiveness of their ship or unit, and thereby put at risk the successful completion of the military mission and/or the safety of other personnel."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=IND&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-11-b&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en|title=United Nations Treaty Collection: 11. b Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict|last=United Nations|first=|date=2018|website=|language=EN|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Child Soldiers International]], the UK deployed 22 armed forces personnel aged under 18 to Iraq and Afghanistan between 2003 and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.child-soldiers.org/shop/letter-from-uk-minister-of-defence-regarding-deployment-of-under-18s-on-combat-operations-1|title=Letter from UK Minister of Defence regarding deployment of under-18s on combat operations|last=Child Soldiers International|first=|date=|website=Child Soldiers International|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Committee on the Rights of the Child]] has urged the UK to alter its policy so as to ensure that children cannot take part in hostilities under any circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://docstore.ohchr.org/SelfServices/FilesHandler.ashx?enc=6QkG1d%2fPPRiCAqhKb7yhsq3bGBgj7nnUgqOo%2fynBtO%2fECmRLeJYMRRb8lvcSbqdOqBHRHPeEfDShf9Gxj%2fukpq4N94ALY5Qdg0j45LrQBaPGQXGbBD6vlaVe0jP8YmSl1Fv0VQtoxAQPfw%2bSfBE8YQ%3d%3d|title=Consideration of Reports submitted by States Parties under Article 8 of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict.

A '''constitutional referendum''' was held in [[Samoa]] on 12 November 1990. Voters were asked whether they approved of the introduction of [[universal suffrage]] and a second chamber of Parliament. The first change was approved by 52.6% of voters, but the second opposed by 60.7%. Voter turnout was 74.3% for the first question and 73.7% for the second.&lt;ref&gt;Nohlen, D, Grotz, F &amp; Hartmann, C (2001) ''Elections in Asia: A data handbook, Volume II'', p786 {{ISBN|0-19-924959-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although universal suffrage was introduced, candidates in elections still had to be part of the [[Fa'amatai|Matai]].&lt;ref&gt;Nohlen, D, Grotz, F &amp; Hartmann, C (2001) ''Elections in Asia: A data handbook, Volume II'', p54 {{ISBN|0-19-924959-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case concerned a fatal helicopter crash which killed Yong Joon San, a wealthy business magnate, amongst others.  Mr Yong's widow tried to sue various parties, including [[Aérospatiale|Société Nationale Industrielle Aérospatiale]] (SNIA) as manufacturer of the helicopter, in the courts of Texas under the Wrongful Death Statute in that state.  SNIA asked the courts to restrain the claimants from proceedings in court by way of an anti-suit injunction.  Their applications failed at first instance and on appeal, but succeeded in the Privy Council.&lt;ref name=Collier /&gt;

In handing down the judgment of the Privy Council, Lord Goff elaborated on the jurisdiction to grant anti-suit injunctions following his earlier decision in {{cite BAILII|litigants=[[Spiliada Maritime Corp v Cansulex Ltd]]|court=UKHL|year=1986|num=10|parallelcite=[1987] AC 460}}, and set out the basic principles to be applied in relation to applications for such injunctions.  He held that it was not enough that the foreign court was not the most appropriate forum - it was necessary to show that the foreign proceedings must be "vexatious or oppressive" for an injunction restraining them to be issued.&lt;ref name=Collier /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.vg/books?id=Uh279h8Tp5oC&amp;pg=PA108&amp;lpg=PA108&amp;dq=Dicey+Morris+%26+Collins+Aerospatiale&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=g0HtIhtAl0&amp;sig=EbDwwFfD2W0zJjVKVrtwU1nKVJk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Dicey%20Morris%20%26%20Collins%20Aerospatiale&amp;f=false |title=Essays in International Litigation and the Conflict of Laws |author=[[Lawrence Collins, Baron Collins of Mapesbury|Lawrence Collins]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=0198257325|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facts==

On 16 December 1980 a [[Aérospatiale SA 330 Puma|Puma 330J helicopter]] crashed near [[Kuala Belait]], [[Brunei]] killing all 12 people on board, including Yong Joon San.  Mr Yong was a very successful businessman, and was estimated have a net worth of approximately US$20 million at his death, and the year before he died he had reportedly earned approximately US$1,800,000.  An official inquiry was launched, which concluded that the case of the accident was "the initial cause of the accident was due to the mistaken health monitoring of the gearbox leading to a deterioration of the mechanical condition of the gearbox components."

Mr Yong's widow (Lee Kui Jak) and brother (Yong Joon Kim) brought proceedings for compensation.  Upon the recommendation of their lawyers they brought the proceedings against a number of parties, including SNIA, in the courts of Texas.  Their lawyer gave evidence to the effect that this was for two reasons: (1) stricter product liability laws, and (2) higher damages in Texas.

SNIA initially tried to have the action in Texas transferred to the Federal courts, and then sought to stay those proceedings on ''[[forum non conveniens]]'' grounds.  Both applications were ultimately unsuccessful, and so they sought injunctions in the Brunei courts to restrain the claimants from pursuing the Texas proceedings.

==Decision==
[[File:Robert_Goff_as_an_appellate_judge.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Lord Goff gave the advice of the Privy Council.]]
The application for an injunction failed at first instance and in the Brunei Court of Appeal.  SNIA then appealed to the Privy Council.  Lord Goff gave the advice of the Board.

===Review of authorities===
After reciting the facts and the history of the proceedings in Texas, he then reviewed the law in relation to anti-suit injunctions.  He reviewed the speech of [[Leslie Scarman, Baron Scarman|Lord Scarman]] in ''Castanho v Brown &amp; Root (UK) Limited'' [1981] AC 557, and the speech of [[Kenneth Diplock, Baron Diplock|Lord Diplock]] in ''MacShannon v Rockware Glass Ltd'' [1978] AC 795.  He referred in particular to the passage of Lord Scarman in ''Castanho'':&lt;ref&gt;[1981] AC 557 at 575&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|Transposed into the context of the present case, this formulation means that to justify the grant of an injunction the defendants must show: (a) that the English court is a forum to hose jurisdiction they are amendable in which justice can be done at substantially less inconvenience and expense, &lt;u&gt;and&lt;/u&gt; (b) the injunction must not deprive the plaintiff of a legitimate personal or juridical advantage which would be available to him if he invoked the [foreign] jurisdiction.}}

He then noted that the injunction operates against the litigants personally, not by way of interference with the foreign proceedings themselves.  He cited with approval the statement of [[John Leach (judge)|Sir John Leach VC]] in ''Bushby v Munday'' (1821) 5 Mad 297:&lt;ref&gt;at 307&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|If a Defendant who was ordered by this Court to discontinue a proceeding which he has commenced against the Plaintiff, in some other Court of Justice, either in this country or abroad, thinks fit to disobey that order, and to prosecute such proceedings, this Court does not pretend to any interference with the other Courts; it acts upon the Defendant by punishment for his contempt in his disobedience to the order of the Court ...}}

Lord Goff then reviewed various other judicial decisions relating to anti-suit injunctions, including his own earlier decision in ''South Carolina Insurance Co v Assurantie Maatschappij "De Zeven Provincient" NV'' [1987] 1 AC 24, which he now indicated he disapproved.  He then noted that earlier authorities had been "overtaken by events", and now needed to reconsidered in light of the ''Spiliada'' decision.  He added that to obtain an injunction it was not sufficient to merely show that the foreign court was not the natural forum, although that would clearly be necessary.  In addition it would be necessary to show that (a) being forced to contest the foreign proceedings would be vexatious or oppressive, and (b) that restraining the foreign proceedings would not deprive the other party of a legitimate advantage in those proceedings.

===''Cambridgeshire'' factor===
The claimants argued that because the proceedings in Texas were so far advanced, they should constitute a ''Cambridgeshire'' factor as outlined in the ''Spiliada'' case.  Lord Goff declined to accept that.  In ''Cambridgeshire'' there was a related case that extremely complex and similar.  In the instant case the Texan lawyers had pushed forward an ordinary trial.  A party could not artificially create a ''Cambridgeshire'' type nexus with a proceeding simply by diligently and expeditiously pursuing procedural steps.

===Vexatious or oppressive===
Lord Goff noted that the claimants had given various undertakings (not to seek a jury trial in Texas, not to seek punitive damages, not to rely upon strict liability under Texas law) which negated much of what might otherwise be considered vexatious or oppressive to a defendant.  However, the ability to claim a [[Contribution claim (legal)|third-party contribution]] from one of their co-defendants, Bristow Malaysia, the operators of the fateful helicopter, had been compromised by a settlement agreement thereby exculpating them from further claims in Texas.  Accordingly, SNIA would be unable to claim a contribution from the party who, according to the official accident report, was primarily responsible for the deaths of those on board.  This, Lord Goff held, was sufficiently oppressive.

===Legitimate advantage===
Lord Goff then turned to consider whether restraining the proceedings would deprive the claimants of a legitimate advantage in the Texas courts.  Having abandoned many of the plaintiff's advantages by undertaking they sought to argue that procedural mechanisms like wider pre-trial discovery were a legitimate advantage in the Texas courts.  But the Privy Council were not persuaded.

==Authority==

The case remains good law today.  Lord Goff cited the case with approval in his subsequent decision on anti-suit injunctions in the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] in {{cite bailii|litigants=Airbus Industrie GIE v Patel|year=1998|court=UKHL|num=12|parallelcite=[1999] 1 AC 119}}.

The case has been repeatedly cited as authority for its central proposition.  In {{cite bailii|litigants=Trafigura Beheer BV v Kookmin Bank Co|year=2005 |court=EWHC |num=2350 |division=Comm}} the court amplified upon the ''Aérospatiale'' test, setting out several core propositions:&lt;ref name=Lexology /&gt;
# The court would grant an injunction where the pursuit of the foreign action was "unconscionable". The injunction is a personal remedy for the wrongful conduct of another party, in respect of conduct which is "vexatious" or "oppressive", but deriving from "the basic principle of justice".
# The courts will readily grant an injunction to restrain proceedings brought in breach of an [[forum selection clause|exclusive jurisdiction clause]] (save in circumstances where the [[Brussels Regime]] applies).
# In the absence of an exclusive jurisdiction clause or some other special factor, a person does not enjoy a right not to be sued in a particular foreign court. Where proceedings are brought in a foreign court, the question of whether or not that forum is an appropriate forum is a factor in assessing the conduct of the party suing there.
# Before granting any injunction the English court must have a sufficient legitimate interest in the foreign proceedings (this is a principle derived from ''Airbus Industrie GIE v Patel''); if there is no contractual bar proceedings there, then there must be some putative proceedings in this jurisdiction which require protection.
# English law attaches a high importance to international comity and the inevitable perception of the foreign court that an injunction amounts to interference in its proceedings, albeit indirectly.  There must therefore be a clear need for protection of some English proceedings.
# An injunction should not deprive a claimant of a legitimate advantage in any foreign proceedings which it would be unjust to deprive them of.

==Motivation and description==
Sometimes open-source software projects get stuck in a license incompatibility situation. Often the only feasible way to resolve this situation is re-licensing of all participating software parts. For successful relicensing the agreement of all involved copyright holders, typically the developers, to a changed license is required. While in the [[free and open-source]] domain achieving 100% coverage of all authors is often impossible due to the many contributors involved, often it is assumed that a great majority is sufficient. For instance, [[Mozilla]] assumed an author coverage of 95% to be sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.fsfe.org/ciaran/?p=58 |title=(About GPLv3) Can the Linux Kernel Relicense? |first=Ciaran |last=O’Riordan |date=2006-10-06 |accessdate=2015-05-28 |publisher=fsfe.org |quote="Someone who works with many lawyers on free software copyright issues later told me that it is not necessary to get permission from 100% of the copyright holders. It would suffice if there was permission from the copyright holders of 95% of the source code and no objections from the holders of the other 5%. This, I’m told, is how Mozilla was able to relicense to the GPL in 2003 despite years of community contributions."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others in the FOSS domain, as [[Eric S. Raymond]], came to different conclusions regarding the requirements for relicensing of a whole code base.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catb.org/~esr/Licensing-HOWTO.html Licensing HOWTO] by Eric Steven Raymond&amp;Catherine Olanich Raymond ''"Changing an existing license [...]You can change the license on a piece of code under any of the following conditions: If you are the sole copyright holder[...]If you are the sole registered copyright holder[...] If you obtain the consent of all other copyright holders[...]If no other copyright holder could be harmed by the change"'' (accessed on 2015-11-21)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cases==
An early example of an [[Open-source software|open-source]] project who did successfully re-license for license compatibility reasons is the [[Mozilla]] project and their [[Firefox]] [[Web browser|browser]]. The [[source code]] of [[Netscape]]'s [[Netscape Communicator|Communicator 4.0]] browser was originally released in 1998 under the [[Netscape Public License]]/[[Mozilla Public License]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://website-archive.mozilla.org/www.mozilla.org/mpl/MPL/NPL/1.0/FAQ.html Netscape Public License FAQ] on mozilla.org&lt;/ref&gt; but was criticised by the FSF and [[Open Source Initiative|OSI]] for being incompatible.&lt;ref name=OSI&gt;{{cite web|title=Licenses by Name - Open Source Initiative |publisher=Open Source Initiative |url=http://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical |accessdate=2014-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/netscape-npl.html On the Netscape Public License] by [[Richard Stallman]] on GNU.org&lt;/ref&gt; Around 2001 [[Time Warner]], exercising its rights under the Netscape Public License, and at the request of the Mozilla Foundation, relicensed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mozilla.org/MPL/relicensing-faq.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100513062601/http://www-archive.mozilla.org/MPL/relicensing-faq.html |archivedate=2010-05-13 |date= |title=Mozilla Relicensing FAQ Version 1.1 |publisher=mozilla.org |quote=''Some time ago mozilla.org announced its intent to seek relicensing of Mozilla code under a new licensing scheme that would address perceived incompatibilities of the Mozilla Public License (MPL) with the GNU General Public License (GPL) and GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL).''}}&lt;/ref&gt; all code in Mozilla that was under the Netscape Public License (including code by other contributors) to an MPL 1.1/GPL 2.0/[[GNU Lesser General Public License|LGPL]] 2.1 [[tri-license]], thus achieving GPL-compatibility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.gerv.net/2006/03/relicensing_complete/ Relicensing Complete] on gerv.net by Gervase Markham (March 31, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vorbis]] library was originally licensed as [[LGPL]], but in 2001 the license was changed to the [[BSD license]] with endorsement of [[Richard Stallman]] to encourage adoption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lists.xiph.org/pipermail/vorbis/2001-February/001758.html February 2001] on xiph.org ''"With the Beta 4 release, the Ogg Vorbis libraries have moved to the BSD license.  The change from LGPL to BSD was made to enable the use of Ogg Vorbis in all forms of software and hardware. Jack Moffitt says, "We are changing the license in response to feedback from many parties. It has become clear to us that adoption of Ogg Vorbis will be accelerated even further by the use of a less restrictive license that is friendlier toward proprietary software and hardware systems. We want everyone to be able to use Ogg Vorbis.""''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://lwn.net/2001/0301/a/rms-ov-license.php3 RMS on license change] on lwn.net&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[VLC media player|VLC]] project also has a complicated license history due to license compatibility: in 2007 it decided for license compatibility reasons to not upgrade to the just released [[GPLv3]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.videolan.org/press/2007-1.html |title=VLC media player to remain under GNU GPL version 2 |quote=''In 2001, VLC was released under the OSI-approved GNU General Public version 2, with the commonly-offered option to use "any later version" thereof (though there was not any such later version at the time). Following the release by the Free Software Foundation (FSF) of the new version 3 of its GNU General Public License (GPL) on the 29th of June 2007, contributors to the VLC media player, and other software projects hosted at videolan.org, debated the possibility of updating the licensing terms for future version of the VLC media player and other hosted projects, to version 3 of the GPL. [...]  There is strong concern that these new additional requirements might not match the industrial and economic reality of our time, especially in the market of consumer electronics. It is our belief that changing our licensing terms to GPL version 3 would currently not be in the best interest of our community as a whole. Consequently, we plan to keep distributing future versions of VLC media player under the terms of the GPL version 2. [...]we will continue to distribute the VLC media player source code under GPL "version 2 or any later version" until further notice. |publisher=videolan.org|accessdate=2015-11-21|first=Rémi |last=Denis-Courmont }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the VLC was removed from [[Apple App Store]] at the beginning of 2011, in October 2011 the VLC project re-licensed the VLC library part from the GPLv2 to the LGPLv2 to achieve better compatibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Changing the VLC engine license to LGPL|url=http://www.videolan.org/press/lgpl.html |accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vaughan-Nichols|first=Steven|title=No GPL Apps for Apple's App Store |url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/open-source/no-gpl-apps-for-apples-app-store/8046|accessdate=23 October 2011 |publisher=[[zdnet.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2013 the VLC application could then be resubmitted to the [[iOS App Store]] relicensed under the [[Mozilla Public License]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://arstechnica.com/apple/2013/07/vlc-media-player-returns-to-the-ios-app-store-after-30-month-hiatus/ VLC under Mozilla public relaunched.] on [[Ars Technica]] (Accessed 10/10/2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[GNU TLS]] project adopted the LGPLv3 license in 2011 but in 2013 relicensed their code back to LGPLv2.1 due to serious license compatibility problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nmav.gnutls.org/2013/03/the-perils-of-lgplv3.html |title=The perils of LGPLv3 |first=Nikos |last=Mavrogiannopoulos |publisher=gnutls.org |date=2013-03-26 |accessdate=2015-11-18 |quote=''LGPLv3 is the latest version of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

This goal has been successfully handled so far by LGPLv2.1, and there is a multitude of libraries using that license. Now we have LGPLv3 as the latest, and the question is how successful is LGPLv3 on this goal? In my opinion, very little.

The [[GNU Free Documentation License]] in version 1.2 is not compatible with the widely used [[Creative Commons]] [[Creative Commons licenses|Attribution-ShareAlike]] license, which was a problem for instance for the [[Wikipedia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://notablog.notafish.com/post/2005/04/21/26-why-the-wikimedia-projects-should-not-use-gfdl-as-a-stand-alone-license-for-images why-the-wikimedia-projects-should-not-use-gfdl-as-a-stand-alone-license-for-images]&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, at the request of the [[Wikimedia Foundation]] the FSF added with version 1.3 of the GFDL a time-limited section allowing specific types of websites using the GFDL to additionally offer their work under the CC BY-SA license.&lt;ref name="onepoint3faq"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl-1.3-faq.html |title=FDL 1.3 FAQ |publisher=Gnu.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following in June 2009, the [[Wikimedia Foundation]] migrated their projects ([[Wikipedia]], etc.) by [[Multi-licensing|dual licensing]] to the [[Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike]] as main license, additional to the previously used [[GNU Free Documentation License|GFDL]].&lt;ref name="wmf2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Resolution:Licensing_update_approval|title=Resolution:Licensing update approval - Wikimedia Foundation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An improved license compatibility with the greater [[free content]] ecosystem was given as reason for the license change.&lt;ref name="wp2009"&gt;[https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/15411 Wikipedia + CC BY-SA = Free Culture Win!] on creativecommons.org by Mike Linksvayer, June 22nd, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.wikimedia.org/2009/06/30/licensing-update-rolled-out-in-all-wikimedia-wikis/ Licensing update rolled out in all Wikimedia wikis] on wikimedia.org by [[Erik Moeller]] on June 30th, 2009 ''"Perhaps the most significant reason to choose CC-BY-SA as our primary content license was to be compatible with many of the other admirable endeavors out there to share and develop free knowledge"''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 the [[OGRE]] project changed their license from the [[LGPL]] to the [[MIT License]]; a simpler license text was given as reason.&lt;ref name="ogre-license"&gt;[http://www.ogre3d.org/licensing/licensing-faq Licensing FAQ] on ogre3d.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stevestreeting.com/2009/09/15/my-evolving-view-of-open-source-licenses/ My evolving view of open source licenses] by Steve (2009/09/15)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ogre3d.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=52538 OGRE Will Switch To The MIT License from 1.7] on ogre3d.org by sinbad (Sep 15, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another case was the relicensing of GPLv2 licensed [[linux kernel]] [[header file]]s to the [[BSD license]] by [[Google]] for their [[Android (OS)|Android]] library [[Bionic (software)|Bionic]]. To get rid of the GPL, Google claimed that the header files were cleaned from any copyright-able work, reducing them to non-copyrightable "facts".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/03/29/google_android_and_the_linux_headers/ Google android and the linux headers] on [[theregister.com]] (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itworld.com/article/2744480/open-source-tools/android--sued-by-microsoft--not-by-linux.html Android: Sued by Microsoft, not by Linux] "Microsoft launches new Android suit, Linus Torvalds' take on Linux kernel headers and Android" on [[ITworld]] (March 21, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation was challenged for instance by Raymond Nimmer, a law professor at the [[University of Houston Law Center]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipinfoblog.com/archives/licensing-law-issues-infringement-and-disclosure-risk-in-development-on-copyleft-platforms.html Infringement and disclosure risk in development on copyleft platforms] on ipinfoblog.com by Raymond Nimmer (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 the [[FreeCAD]] project changed their license from GPL to LGPLv2 due to GPLv3/GPLv2 incompatibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libregraphicsworld.org/blog/entry/libredwg-drama-the-end-or-the-new-beginning |title=LibreDWG drama: the end or the new beginning? |first=Alexandre |last=Prokoudine |date=2012-12-27 |quote=''[...]the unfortunate situation with support for DWG files in free CAD software via LibreDWG.

Also the [[Dolphin (emulator)|Dolphin]] project changed its license from "GPLv2 only" to "GPLv2 or any later" for better compatibility in May 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2015/05/25/relicensing-dolphin/ Relicensing Dolphin: The long road to GPLv2+] Written by JMC47, MaJoR on May 25, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015 [[mpv (media player)|mpv]] started the relicensation process of the project's GPL licensed [[source code]] for improved license compatibility under LGPLv2 by getting consent from the majority (95%+) of the contributing developers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/issues/2033 Possible LGPL relicensing #2033] on [[github.com]] ''"GPL-incompatible dependencies such as OpenSSL are a big issue for library users, even if the library user is ok with the GPL."''&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2016 approx. 90% of the authors could be reached and consented.

The '''South African law of delict''' engages primarily with "the circumstances in which one person can claim compensation from another for harm that has been suffered."&lt;ref&gt;Loubser, et al. 2009, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; JC Van der Walt and Rob Midgley define a [[delict]] "in general terms [...] as a civil wrong," and more narrowly as "wrongful and blameworthy conduct which causes harm to a person."&lt;ref&gt;Van der Walt and Midgley 2005, par. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Importantly, however, the civil wrong must be an actionable one, resulting in liability on the part of the wrongdoer or [[tort]]feasor.&lt;ref&gt;The terms "delict" and "tort" are synonymous and interchangeable, the only difference being that "delict" is used in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] or European systems and those linked to Roman law (like South Africa and [[Scotland]]), while "tort" is used by systems based on [[English law#Common law|English common law]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The delictual inquiry "is in fact a loss-allocation exercise, the principles and rules of which are set out in the law of delict."&lt;ref&gt;Loubser, et al. 2009, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The classic remedy for a delict is compensation: a claim of damages for the harm caused. If this harm takes the form of patrimonial loss, one uses the Aquilian action; if pain and suffering associated with bodily injury, a separate action arises, similar to the Aquilian action but of Germanic origin; finally, if the harm takes the form of injury to a personality interest (an ''injuria''), the claim is made in terms of the ''actio injuriarum''.

== Sources ==
[[Delict]] in [[Roman law]] fell under the [[law of obligations]].&lt;ref&gt;"When a delict has been committed, one person is obliged to compensate another for harm that has been suffered" (Loubser, ''et al''. 2009, p. 4).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roman-Dutch law]], based on Roman law, is the strongest influence on South Africa's [[common law]], where delict also falls under the law of obligations. As has been pointed out, however,

&lt;blockquote&gt;In contrast to the casuistic approach of the Roman law of delict, the South African law of delict is based [...] on three pillars: the ''actio legis Aquiliae'', the ''[[actio iniuriarum]]'' and the action for pain and suffering. Unlike the last-mentioned action which developed in Roman-Dutch law, the first two remedies had already played an important role in Roman law.&lt;ref&gt;Neethling, et al. 2003, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Damages ==
Damages in delict are broadly divided into

* patrimonial damages, including medical costs, loss of income and the cost of repairs, which in turn fall under the heading of special damages;
* non-patrimonial damages, including pain and suffering, disfigurement, loss of amenities and injury to personality, which fall under the heading of general damages; and
* pure economic harm, which is not connected to any physical injury or damage to property.
*obligations arise from three causes namely delict,contract and various other causes, notable unjustified enrichment

== Liability ==
Although delict may be described as at bottom a system of loss allocation, it is important to note that not every damage or loss will incur liability at law. "Sound policy," wrote [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr]], "lets losses lie where they fall, except where a special reason can be shown for interference." As [[Christian von Bar]] puts it, "The law of delict can only operate as an effective, sensible and fair system of compensation if excessive liability is avoided. It is important to prevent it becoming a disruptive factor in an economic sense. No law based on rational principles can impose liability on each and every act of carelessness."&lt;ref&gt;Von Bar 4.&lt;/ref&gt; There are, for this reason, in-built mechanisms in the South African law of delict to keep liability within reasonable limits. The element of fault, introduced below, is one such. If its conditions are not met, liability will not arise.

== Elements ==
Van der Walt and Midgley list the elements of a delict as follows:

# "harm sustained by the plaintiff;"
# "conduct on the part of the defendant which is
# "wrongful;"
# "a causal connection between the conduct and the plaintiff's harm;" and
# "fault or blameworthiness on the part of the defendant."&lt;ref&gt;Van der Walt and Midgley 2005, par. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The elements of harm and conduct are fact-based inquiries, while causation is part-factual and part-normative, and wrongfulness and fault are entirely normative: that is, value-based, in that they articulate a wider societal policy perspective. Delict is "inherently a flexible set of principles that embody social policy."&lt;ref&gt;Loubser ''et al''. 2009, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Harm ===
The harm element is "the cornerstone of the law of delict, and our fundamental point of departure."&lt;ref&gt;Loubser, ''et al''. 2009, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Once the nature of the harm is identified, it is possible to identify the nature of the enquiry and the elements that need to be proven. There is an interplay between the elements of harm and wrongfulness, and a similar interaction between the way in which we determine harm and assess damages. "For conceptual clarity," suggest the academic authorities, "it is always important to remember where we are going along the problem-solving route towards the intended destination."&lt;ref&gt;Loubser, ''et al''. 2009, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conduct ===
It is vitally important that the conduct be voluntary. There must be no compulsion, in other words, and it must not be a reflex action. (The person engaging in the conduct must also be ''compos mentis'' or in sound mind and of sober senses, not unconscious or intoxicated, for example. He must be accountable for his actions, having the ability to distinguish between right and wrong, and to act accordingly. Unless this standard of accountability is secured, he will not be accountable for his actions or omissions. There will be no [[South_African_law_of_delict#Fault|fault]].) Conduct relates to overt behaviour, so that thoughts, for example, are not delictual. If it is a positive act or commission, it may be either physical or a statement or comment; if an omission—that is, a failure to do or say something—liability arises only in special circumstances. There is no general legal duty to prevent harm.

=== Causation ===
Conduct in the law of delict is usually divided into factual and legal causation. Factual causation is proven by a "demonstration that the wrongful act was a ''causa sine qua non'' of the loss." This is also known as the "but-for" test. A successful demonstration, however, "does not necessarily result in legal liability." Once factual causation is proved, a second enquiry arises: Is the wrongful act linked sufficiently closely or directly to the loss for legal liability to ensue? Is there legal liability, or is the loss "too remote"? This is basically a juridical problem. Considerations of policy may play a part in its solution.&lt;ref&gt;''[[International Shipping Co (Pty) Ltd v Bentley]]'' 1990 (1) SA 680 (A).&lt;/ref&gt; The courts take a flexible approach based on considerations of reasonableness and fairness and justice, although there are misgivings. As the court put it in ''[[Fourway Haulage SA v SA National Roads Agency]]'',&lt;ref&gt;2009 2 SA 150 (SCA).&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Considerations of fairness and equity must inevitably depend on the view of the individual judge. In considering the appropriate approach to wrongfulness, I said that any yardstick which renders the outcome of a dispute dependent on the idiosyncratic view of individual judges is unacceptable. The same principle must, in my view, apply with reference to remoteness. That is why I believe we should resist the temptation of a response that remoteness depends on what the judge regards as fair, reasonable and just in all the circumstances of that particular case. Though it presents itself as a criterion of general validity, it is, in reality, no criterion at all.&lt;ref&gt;Para 33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In summary, delictual liability requires a factual causal link between wrongful and culpable conduct, on the one hand, and loss suffered on the other. There must also be legal causation; the loss must not be too remote. To establish legal causation, the courts apply a flexible test based on reasonableness, fairness and justice, or policy and normative considerations. The flexible test, or "elastic test for legal causation," incorporates subsidiary tests; it does not replace them.&lt;ref&gt;Loubser ''et al''. 2009, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rigidity, the court held in ''[[Smit v Abrahams]]'',&lt;ref&gt;1994 (4) SA 1 (A).&lt;/ref&gt; is inconsistent with the flexible approach or criterion in South African law, whereby the court considers on the basis of policy considerations whether there is a sufficiently close connection between act and consequence. That question has to be answered on the basis of policy considerations and the limits of reasonableness, fairness and justice. Reasonable foreseeability cannot be regarded as the single decisive criterion for determining liability, but it can indeed be used as a subsidiary test in the application of the flexible criterion. The flexibility criterion is predominant; any attempt to detract from it should be resisted. Comparisons between the facts of the case which has to be resolved and the facts of other cases in which a solution has already been found can obviously be useful and of value, and sometimes decisive, but one should be careful not to attempt to distill fixed or generally applicable rules or principles from the process of comparison. There is only one principle, the court found: To determine whether the plaintiff's damages are too remote from the defendant's act to hold the defendant liable therefor, considerations of policy (reasonableness, fairness and justice) should be applied to the particular facts of the case.&lt;ref&gt;17–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''[[novus actus interveniens]]'' is an independent and extraneous factor or event which is not foreseeable and which actively contributes to the occurrence of harm after the original harm has occurred. This is the case, for example, in ''[[International Shipping v Bentley]]'', where there was an auditing error, and in ''[[Mafesa v Parity]]'', with a "crutch mishap."

The ''[[talem qualem]]'' rule (or "thin-skull" or "egg-skull" rule) provides that, in the words of ''Smit v Abrahams'', "the wrongdoer takes his victim as he finds him."&lt;ref&gt;171.&lt;/ref&gt; An important case here is ''[[Smith v Leach Brain]]''.&lt;ref&gt;(1962) 2 QB 405.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fault ===
Fault refers to blameworthiness or culpability, while ''culpa'' is fault in a broad sense, in that it includes ''dolus'' and ''culpa'' in the strict sense. Accountability is a prerequisite for fault: The person at fault, to be at fault, must be ''culpae capax'', having the ability to know the difference between right and wrong and to act accordingly. Unless one is in this sense accountable, one is not accountable for one's actions or omissions; one is, in other words, ''culpa incapax''. It is important to remember that there is a distinction between the question of absence of voluntariness of conduct and that of accountability. Voluntary conduct entails no compulsion; the conduct must not have been reflex; the person must have been ''compos mentis'', or of sound mind and sober senses, not unconscious, intoxicated etcetera.

Accountability relates to overt behaviour (Thoughts cannot be delictual.) There must be some positive act or commission, either physical or in the form of a statement or comment, or else an omission: a failure to do or say something. Liability only arises in special circumstances: There is no general legal duty to prevent harm. Factors excluding liability include

* youth or emotional and intellectual immaturity;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Weber v Santam]]'' 1983 1 SA 381 (A).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Eskom v Hendriks]]'' 2005 5 SA 503 (SCA).&lt;/ref&gt;
* mental disease or illness, or emotional distress;&lt;ref&gt;''[[S v Campher]]'' 1987 1 SA 940 (A).&lt;/ref&gt;
* intoxication;&lt;ref&gt;''[[S v Chretien]]'' 1981 1 SA 1097 (A).&lt;/ref&gt; and
* provocation.&lt;ref&gt;''S v Campher''.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two main components of intention:

* direction of the will (the manner in which the will is directed):
** dolus directus;
** dolus indirectus; and
** dolus eventualis;
* consciousness of wrongfulness&lt;ref&gt;''[[Maisel v Van Naeren]]'' 1960 4 SA 836 (C).&lt;/ref&gt;

''Animus iniuriani'' arises when both requirements—direction of will and knowledge of wrongfulness—are satisfied. The test is subjective. There are exceptions to the requirement of knowledge of wrongfulness, as in the case of deprivation of liberty or wrongful arrest, which results in attentuated ''animus iniuriandi''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Minister of Justice v Hofmeyr]]'' 1993 (3) SA 131 (A).&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several defences which exclude intent:

* mistake;&lt;ref&gt;''Maisel v Van Nairen''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* jest;
* intoxication;
* provocation; and
* emotional distress.

The test for negligence is one of the objective or reasonable person (''bonus paterfamilias''). The test requires "an adequate and consistent level of care on the part of all legal subjects." It "does not represent a standard of exceptional skill, giftedness or care but does also not represent a standard of undeveloped skills, recklessness or thoughtlessness." It is the standard of the ordinary individual who takes 	reasonable chances and reasonable precautions.

The test has two pillars:

* foreseeability, which refers to
** the likelihood or degree or extent of risk created by the conduct; and
** the gravity of possible consequences; and
* preventability, under which heading may fall
** utility of conduct; and
** burden.

== Omissions ==

=== Negligent misstatements ===
A negligent misstatement takes the form of conduct or words that mislead a person to act to his or her detriment;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Administrateur, Natal v Trust Bank van Africa Bpk]]'' 1979 3 SA 824 (A).&lt;/ref&gt; if conduct, it may take the form either of omission or of commission.

== Remedies ==
There are, as has already been noted, three main delictual remedies:

* the ''[[South African law of delict#Aquilian action|actio legis Aquiliae]]'', or Aquilian action, which relates to patrimonial loss;
* the ''[[South African law of delict#Actio iniuriarum|actio iniuriarum]]'', which relates to injuries to personality or ''iniuria''; and
* the [[South African law of delict#Action for pain and suffering|action for pain and suffering]], which relates to pain and suffering and psychiatric injury.

The various delictual actions are not mutually exclusive. It is possible for a person to suffer various forms of harm at the same time, which means that a person may simultaneously claim remedies under more than one action.&lt;ref&gt;Loubser, ''et al''. 2009, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aquilian action ===
There are five essential elements for liability in terms of the ''[[lex Aquilia|actio legis Aquiliae]]'':

# The [[South African law of delict#Harm or loss|harm]] must take the form of patrimonial loss.
# The [[South African law of delict#Conduct|conduct]] must take the form of a positive act or an omission or statement.
# The conduct must be [[South African law of delict#Wrongfulness or unlawfulness|wrongful]]: that is to say, objectively unreasonable and without lawful justification.&lt;ref&gt;If one has a valid defence, one's conduct is justified, and one has not behaved wrongfully or unlawfully.&lt;/ref&gt;
# One must be at [[South African law of delict#Fault|fault]], and one's blameworthiness must take the form of ''dolus'' (intention) or ''culpa'' (negligence). One must, however, be accountable for one's conduct before one can be blameworthy.
# There must be [[South African law of delict#Causation|causation]] both factual and legal. For the former, the conduct must have been a ''sine qua non'' of the loss; for the latter, the link must not be too tenuous.

==== Harm or loss ====
One obvious prerequisite for liability in terms of the law of delict is that the plaintiff must have suffered harm; in terms of the Aquilian action, that harm must be patrimonial, which traditionally meant monetary loss sustained due to physical damage to a person or property. Now, however, patrimonial loss also includes monetary loss resulting from [[nervous shock (English Law)|injury to the nervous system]] and pure economic loss. A plaintiff may claim compensation both for loss actually incurred and for prospective loss, including, for instance, the loss of earning capacity, future profits, income and future expenses.

==== Conduct ====
Delictual harm is usually caused, if not always directly,&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the ''[[actio de pauperie]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; by human conduct.&lt;ref&gt;Loubser, et al. 2009, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; The person responsible must have legal capacity, and his conduct ought to be voluntary, much as in [[criminal law]]. Delictual conduct includes positive acts and omissions and statements. One of the reasons why the law distinguishes between different forms of conduct is that this affects the way the courts deal with the question of [[South African law of delict#Wrongfulness or unlawfulness|wrongfulness]]. Courts tend to be stricter when considering whether omissions or statements are wrongful.

===== Wrongfulness or unlawfulness =====
The defendant's conduct must be wrongful or unlawful. (These terms are usually interchangeable.) Whether or not conduct is wrongful is a question of social policy; the court is required to make a value judgment as to its acceptability.

The principle to be applied is one of objective reasonableness. The court inquires into whether or not the defendant's conduct is socially acceptable

* by balancing the interests of the parties;
* by looking at the relationships which exist and the consequences of the defendant's conduct; and
* by considering the results of a decision in favour of either party.

Objectively reasonable conduct accords with the legal convictions or ''boni mores'' of the society.

When a court holds that conduct is wrongful, it makes a value judgment that, in certain categories of cases, particular people should be responsible for the harm they cause. This involves a balancing of the interests of the plaintiff, the defendant and of society in general.

In determining whether or not conduct is objectively reasonable, the courts apply certain well-established rules of thumb. These are determined by the nature and consequences of the conduct:

* Conduct is usually wrongful if it causes harm to person or property. In the absence of a defence or any other factor, the harm caused is actionable.
* Where the conduct takes the form of omissions or negligent statements, it is usually not wrongful even if physical harm results. The courts scrutinise such cases very carefully, as special factors need to exist for liability to arise.
* Where harm takes the form of nervous shock, the conduct is again not wrongful unless special reasons exist to warrant liability.
* In all instances the court will consider possible defences. Some of these are aimed at showing that the conduct was not unlawful. Examples include self-defence, necessity, justification, statutory authority and consent.

===== Omissions =====
An omission, as noted previously, is not ''prima facie'' wrongful, even when physical damage is caused. The courts' tendency is to be more lenient for omissions than for positive conduct. An omission will be considered wrongful only if there was a duty to act positively to prevent harm to the plaintiff. The existence of a legal duty to act positively depends on the legal (rather than the moral) convictions of the community. The following are examples of how this standard is met:

* where one has control of a potentially dangerous object or animal;
* where one holds [[public office]];
* where there is a contractual assumption of responsibility;
* where there exists a statutory duty (although this is also contingent on its nature); and
* where the harm is foreseeable.

===== Psychiatric injury =====
Nervous or psychiatric injury is sustained through the medium of the eye or the ear without direct physical impact: that means, a mental rather than a physical injury. For patrimonial loss to be actionable in the case of emotional shock, it must have been intentionally or negligently inflicted. The objective-reasonableness test may be satisfied by looking at the foreseeability of such an injury. There are six established principles:

# Mental harm must arise.
# It must not have been a trivial emotional experience.
# If an intention to shock is established, intention limits the ambit of the claim.
# In the alternative, it must be negligently inflicted.
# Injury by shock must in either case be foreseeable.
# The injured party must be foreseeable. There must be some relationship or proximity between him and the injurer, or else some special knowledge on the part of the latter.

==== Defences ====
A distinction should be drawn between defences aimed at the wrongfulness element and defences which serve to exclude [[South African law of delict#Fault|fault]]. Grounds of justification may be described as circumstances which occur typically or regularly in practice, and which indicate conclusively that interference with a person's legally-protected interests is reasonable and therefore lawful. They are practical examples of circumstances justifying a ''prima fade'' infringement of a recognised right or interest, according to the fundamental criterion of reasonableness. They are another expression of the legal convictions of the society.

===== Consent =====
Consent to injury, or ''[[Volenti non fit injuria]]'', is a full defence; if successful, there is no delict. As a general defence, it can take two forms:

# consent to a specific harmful act of the defendant; and
# assumption of the risk of harm connected with the activity of the defendant.

There are five requirements for the defence of consent:

# capacity;
# knowledge and appreciation of harm; and
# consent, or free and voluntary assumption of risk. In addition,
# the consent must not have been socially undesirable—not seduction, or murder for insurance purposes; and
# the consent must not have been revoked.

===== Necessity and private defence =====
Necessity is conduct directed at an innocent person as a result of [[duress]] or compulsion, or a threat by a third party or an outside force. [[Private defence]] (or self-defence) is conduct directed at the person responsible for the duress or compulsion or threat. There is, therefore, an important distinction between the two.

In cases of necessity and private defence, the question is this: Under which circumstances would the legal convictions of the community consider it reasonable to inflict harm to prevent it? The test is objective. It requires a balancing of the parties' and of society's interests. The role of the person against whom the defensive conduct is directed is an important factor in determining whether defence or necessity is being pled. An act of necessity is calculated to avert harm by inflicting it on an innocent person, whereas an act of defence is always directed at a wrongdoer.

A person acts in "private defence," and therefore lawfully, when he uses force to ward off an unlawful attack against his or someone else's property or person. A person acts in "self-defence" when he defends his own body against unlawful attack by someone else. One therefore cannot invoke the justification of self-defence when acting in the interests of another person, but it is possible to invoke the justification of private defence when acting in one's own interests.

Conduct will be justified as an act in private defence or self-defence if it is

* lawful;
* directed against a wrongdoer; and
* for the protection of the actor's or a third party's interest, which is threatened or attacked by the wrongdoer.

The violence used in defence must not exceed what is reasonably necessary to avert the threatened danger:

* The attack must have constituted a real or imminent infringement of the defendant's rights.
* The attack must have been unlawful.
* The defensive conduct must have been directed at the attacker.
* The defence must have been necessary to protect the threatened interests.
* It must have been reasonable: An act of defence is justified only if it was reasonably necessary for the purpose of protecting the threatened or infringed interest.

An act of '''necessity''' may be described as lawful conduct directed against an innocent person for the purpose of protecting an interest of the actor or of a third party (including the innocent person) against a dangerous situation, which may have arisen owing to the wrongful conduct of another or the behaviour of an animal, or through natural forces. Two types of emergency situations may be found:

# those caused by humans; and
# those caused by natural forces.

==== Fault ====

===== Accountability =====
A person cannot be at fault if he does not have the capacity to be at fault. In other words, one must have the capacity to be held accountable for one's conduct. This involves two questions:

# whether or not the person has the ability to distinguish between right and wrong (that is, the nature of his insight and understanding); and
# whether or not the person can act in accordance with that insight and understanding (that is, his self-control and ability to check impulsive conduct).

The enquiry is purely subjective, focusing on the capacity of the specific individual, and is concerned with the mental, not the physical, capacity of a person. A person's capacity may be affected by any number of factors, such as youth, mental illness, intoxication and provocation.

===== Intention =====
Intention (''dolus'') concerns the actor's state of mind. One will be held responsible for the intentional results of one's conduct even if it is occasioned by an unintended method (although this is subject, of course, to the presence of the other elements of liability). ''Animus iniuriandi'' is the intention (''animus'') to injure (''iniuria'') someone. It is the same as ''dolus'' in criminal law.

The test for intention is subjective. One must

* intend to injure; and
* know that it is wrongful (''[[onregmatigheidsbewussyn]]'').&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.sabinet.co.za/abstracts/obiter/obiter_v31_n3_a12.html Onregmatigheidsbewussyn as element van animus iniuriandi by iniuria]" by J Neethling – 2010 ([[Afrikaans]]).&lt;/ref&gt; This is also referred to as "consciousness of wrongfulness."

Intention should not be confused with malice or motive. One must distinguish between

* how the act was committed (intention); and
* why the act was committed (motive).

===== Defences =====
There are several defences excluding intent:

* Ignorance as to the wrongful character of the conduct, or a '''mistaken''' belief in the lawfulness of the conduct, excludes intent on the part of the defendant.
* In an extreme case one may be '''provoked''' to a degree of anger which renders one ''[[doli et culpae incapax]]''. In other instances, provocation may serve to rebut the presumption of ''animus iniuriandi'' or as a ground for justification.
* The defence of '''jest''' is directed at the first aspect of intention: ''viz'', that the will was not directed at the attainment of a particular consequence. The sole criterion is whether or not the defendant subjectively and in good faith meant the conduct to be a joke.
* In exceptional circumstances a person may be '''intoxicated''' to such an extent that he or she lacks the capacity to be to formulate an intention and therefore to be at fault. If an intoxicated person is found to have had capacity, it is still possible to prove that either of the two aspects of intention is absent.
* The principles applicable to instances of intoxication apply equally to cases involving '''emotional distress'''.
* An '''insane''' person cannot be held accountable for his or her conduct.
* '''Youth''' may indicate lack of accountability.

===== Negligence =====
Negligence (''culpa'') occurs where there is an inadequate standard of behaviour. It reflects the law's disapproval of the defendant's conduct. The conduct is tested against what the reasonable person in the position of the defendant would have foreseen and what he would have done to avoid the consequences. ''Culpa'' is partly an objective and partly a subjective concept. The reasonable person is placed in the position of the defendant.

At issue is the law's disapproval of the defendant's conduct, not of his state of mind. To establish negligence, the law sets a standard of conduct (that of the ''diligens paterfamilias'') and then measures the defendant's conduct against it. The test comprises three elements:

# reasonable foreseeability of harm;
# reasonable precautions to prevent the occurrence of such foreseeable harm; and
# failure to take the reasonable precautions.

The standard was well-articulated in ''[[Kruger v Coetzee]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;For the purposes of liability ''culpa'' arises if

:''a'') a ''diligens paterfamilias'' in the position of the defendant

::''i''. would foresee the reasonable possibility of his conduct injuring another in his person or property and causing him patrimonial loss;
::''ii''. would take reasonable steps to guard against such occurrence; and

:''b'') the defendant failed to take such steps.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Conduct is therefore negligent if a reasonable person in the same position as the defendant would have foreseen the possibility of harm, and would have taken steps to avoid it, and if the defendant failed to take such steps.

===== Foreseeability =====
The first element of the foreseeability criterion is that the possibility of harm to others must have been reasonably foreseeable: Was there, in other words, a recognisable risk of harm? The concept of reasonable foreseeability is not founded on statistical or mathematical calculations of the extent of the risk, but on a legal evaluation of the risk created in a particular situation. The guidelines for determining reasonable foreseeability were formulated in ''[[Lomagundi Sheetmetal and Engineering v Basson]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;What a prudent man would or would not do, or would or would not foresee in any particular case, must depend on a very wide variety of circumstances and few cases are ever identical in the relevant circumstances. The sort of circumstances, however, which the Courts often look to in cases such as this in deciding what degree of foreseeability must be proved by the plaintiff before a defendant can be held responsible for the resultant damage are these:

# how real is the risk of the harm eventuating?
# if the harm does eventuate, what is the extent of the damage likely to be; and
# what are the costs or difficulties involved in guarding against the risk?&lt;ref&gt;1973 (4) SA 523 (RA) at 524–525.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The magnitude of the risk created by the defendant (point 1. above) comprises two elements:

# how strong the chance is of harm; and
# the gravity or seriousness of the possible harmful consequences that are risked.

If the likelihood of harm is relatively great, or the consequences serious, the possibility of harm will normally be reasonably foreseeable. Where the risk of harm is very small, or the harm not really serious, the reasonable person will not foresee the possibility of harm to others.

===== Preventability =====
Once it has been established that a reasonable person would have foreseen the possibility of harm, the question arises of whether or not he would have taken measures to prevent the occurrence of the foreseeable harm. There are four basic considerations in each case which influence the reaction of the reasonable person in such situations:

# the degree or extent of the risk created by the actor's conduct;
# the gravity of the possible consequences if the risk of harm materialises;
# the utility of the actor's conduct; and
# the burden of eliminating the risk of harm.

If the magnitude of the risk outweighs the utility of the conduct, the reasonable person would take measures to prevent the occurrence of harm. If the actor fails to take such measures, he acts negligently. If the burden of eliminating a risk of harm outweighs the magnitude of the risk, the reasonable person would not take steps to prevent the occurrence of the foreseeable harm. In some instances, the possibility of harm resulting, even if serious, may be so slight that precautions need not be taken at all.

==== Causation ====
Causation has two elements: factual and legal.

===== Factual causation =====
For liability to arise, there must be a causal link between the defendant's conduct and the plaintiff's loss. The [[Supreme Court of Appeal of South Africa|Supreme Court of Appeal]] (SCA) has accepted the ''conditio [[sine qua non]]'', or "but-for" test, as the one to be applied. A relevant question is whether the defendant's wrongful conduct caused, or materially contributed to, the harm sustained by the plaintiff.&lt;ref&gt;''Minister of Police v Skosana'' 1977 (1) SA 31 (A) 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Legal causation =====
The SCA has consistently stated that the causation element involves a second aspect, legal causation or remoteness of damage, which is not concerned with causation so much as with restricting the causal effect of the defendant's conduct. Various tests for legal causation have been suggested but the Appellate Division has opted for a flexible umbrella criterion, which determines the closeness of the link according to what is fair and reasonable and just. Here are a few relevant questions:

* Is the factual link strong enough?
* Is the harm sufficiently closely connected to the conduct?
* Should the law confirm that the defendant caused the harm, or should liability be limited?

==== Damages ====
The primary object of an award for damages is to compensate the person who has suffered harm. In respect of a claim in terms of the Aquilian action, there is only one function: to restore the plaintiff's patrimony and, as far as possible, to place him in the position he would have occupied in had the delict not been committed. Money is considered an adequate replacement for the lost patrimony. Damages under the Aquilian action do not serve to assuage wounded feelings or to compensate for inconvenience or discomfort or annoyance. (Any element of attachment or affection for a damaged article, for example, is excluded.) Where harm admits of exact monetary quantification, the plaintiff must produce sufficient evidence to make an accurate assessment. A court will not make an arbitrary award in the absence of available evidence. Where damages cannot be computed exactly, a court may exercise its own judgment in the matter, provided it has a factual basis for so doing.

===== Reduction and apportionment of damages =====
Liability for the loss is shared by those who are responsible for it. If the plaintiff's negligent conduct contributes to the loss, that should be considered in determining the extent of the defendant's liability. Contributory negligence is not a defence; it does not extinguish the defendant's liability. It does, however, serve to reduce the damages award.

Similarly, joint wrongdoers are jointly and severally liable for the loss they have caused. A plaintiff may sue one or all of them. Where an award is made against one joint wrongdoer, he may claim a contribution from the other joint wrongdoers according to the extent of their proportionate fault.

=== Action for pain and suffering ===
The [[Roman-Dutch law|Roman-Dutch]] action for pain and suffering ([[Afrikaans_language|Afrik]] ''aksie weens pyn en lyding''), or action for [[solatium]], developed in the 17th century partly from the Aquilian action, partly from the use of reparative fines (or ''[[:nl:weergeld|zoengeld]]'', ''compositie'') under Dutch [[Custom (law)|customary]] law.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Smits, ''The Making of European Private Law: Toward a Ius Commune Europaeum as a Mixed Legal System'' (Antwerp: Intersentia, 2002), 239.&lt;/ref&gt; This action may be raised on five essential heads of liability:

# '''Harm or loss''': Pain and suffering is intangible harm associated with personal bodily injury to the plaintiff: for example, actual pain, the loss of amenities of life and the loss of life expectancy.
# '''Conduct''': in the form of a positive act, an omission or a statement.
# '''Wrongfulness or unlawfulness''': conduct which is objectively unreasonable and without lawful justification. If one has a valid defence, one's conduct is justified and one has not behaved wrongfully or unlawfully.
# '''Fault''': blameworthiness in the form of ''dolus'' (intention) or ''culpa'' (negligence). One must, however, be accountable for one's conduct before one can be blameworthy.
# '''Causation''': factual causation&lt;ref&gt;The conduct must have been a ''sine qua non'' of the loss.&lt;/ref&gt; and legal causation.&lt;ref&gt;The link must not be too tenuous.&lt;/ref&gt;

Except for harm, the heads of liability for the action for pain and suffering are exactly the same as for the Aquilian action. The claims are usually embodied in one action, and no distinction is drawn between the Aquilian action and the action for pain and suffering.

For the action to succeed, a claim must be based on physical pain, mental distress, shock, loss of life expectancy, loss of life amenities, inconvenience and discomfort, disability or disfigurement (and the humility and sadness which arise therefrom). The important feature in all of these instances is that the harm must be linked to some bodily injury suffered by the plaintiff. Such loss is non-patrimonial, in that it is intangible and does not impact negatively on the plaintiff's economic or monetary position.

Damages for non-patrimonial loss, or [[solatium]], do not serve a compensatory function, for such loss does not have an economic or pecuniary value. Instead the emphasis is on providing satisfaction or solace to the plaintiff in so far as it is possible for an award of money to do so. The purpose of obtaining solatium is to provide reparation for the wrong; the award does not have a punitive purpose.

=== ''Actio iniuriarum'' ===

==== Essential elements of liability ====
For liability under the ''actio iniuriarum'', the general elements of delict must be present, but specific rules have been developed for each element. Causation, for example, is seldom in issue, and is assumed to be present. The elements of liability under the ''actio iniuriarum'' are as follows:

* harm, in the form of a violation of a personality interest (one's ''corpus'', ''dignitas'' and ''fama'');
* wrongful conduct; and
* intention.

===== Harm =====
Under the ''actio iniuriarum'', harm consists in the infringement of a personality right:

====== ''Corpus'' ======
Infringements of a person's ''corpus'' include assaults, acts of a sexual or indecent nature, and wrongful arrest and detention.

====== ''Dignitas'' ======
''Dignitas'' is a generic term meaning "worthiness," "dignity" and "self respect," and comprises related concerns like mental tranquillity and privacy. Because it is such a wide concept, its infringement must be serious. Not every insult is humiliating; one must prove ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20121001091945/http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/contumelia contumelia]''. This includes insult (''[https://web.archive.org/web/20110911024529/http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/iniuria iniuria]'' in the narrow sense), adultery, loss of consortium, alienation of affection, breach of promise (but only in a humiliating or degrading manner), violation of chastity and femininity (as in the cases of peeping toms, sexual suggestions in letters, indecent exposure, seduction, [[wrongful dismissal]] of an employee in humiliating terms and unwarranted discrimination on grounds of sex, colour or creed).

====== ''Fama'' ======
Infringement of ''fama'' is the impairment of reputation, better known as defamation.

===== Conduct =====
Conduct usually takes the form of statements, either oral or in writing; nevertheless, other forms of conduct, such as physical contact or gestures, could also arise. The principles are the same as those applicable to the Aquilian action.

===== Fault =====
Fault must be in the form of intention. One cannot be held liable for having negligently insulted or defamed another, or for having negligently invaded another's privacy. The intention element is the same as that discussed under the Aquilian action.

===== Causation =====
As can be seen from the outline of the essential elements of liability under the ''actio iniuriarum'', causation is not an important issue in this kind of case. It is, for present purposes, always assumed.

===== Wrongfulness =====
Again, the wrongfulness element is the same as that under the Aquilian action. The test is one of objective reasonableness. One has to determine whether or not the plaintiff's personality right was infringed in an unlawful way and without justification. The applicable defences are different, however.

==== Defences ====

===== Privileged occasion =====
Privileged occasion is a defence against wrongfulness and is assessed objectively. The following are examples:

* Statements published in '''the discharge of a duty, the exercise of a right or the furtherance of a legitimate interest'''. There is no closed list; public policy determines what should be included. Usually the right to give has a corresponding duty, legal or moral or social, to receive the information. If not, there must be a corresponding interest, and the interest must be legitimate. The test is objective and guided by public policy. Malice or improper motive, or the pursuit some illegitimate purpose, will lead to the forfeiture of the defence.
* Statements connected to '''judicial proceedings'''.
* Reports of '''court proceedings, parliament and other public bodies'''.

===== Truth and the public benefit =====
Falsity is not essential in defamation cases; the truth, indeed, may be defamatory. Truth is only a defence if publication is also for the public benefit.

Only material allegations need be substantially true, except if fraud or crime or dishonesty is alleged. Exaggeration is allowed, but not if calculated to convey the wrong impression.

Some advantage must accrue to the public. Publication of true information about public figures is usually for the public benefit. It is not for the public benefit, however, to publish matter which is only partially true, or to rake up the past: A person can reform. Information on "private people" may also be for the public benefit.

===== Fair comment =====
The general principle is that a defendant is not liable in damages in respect of the publication of defamatory material if it amounts to fair comment on a matter of public interest. The emphasis is on freedom of speech. Fair comment cannot be wrongful. There are, however, certain requirements:

* It must amount to an '''opinion or comment''', not a statement of fact. The assessment of the distinction is objective but not always easy.
* Facts must be '''substantially true''' and either '''stated or well-known'''. The defendant must have been aware of the facts upon which the comment was based.
* The comment must be '''fair'''. The test is whether it was an honest or genuine comment, relevant and without malice. An improper motive forfeits this defence.
* The comment must be in the '''public interest'''. Whether or not it meets this standard will depend on the facts of each case. The concept "in the public interest" is given a wide interpretation, and includes the administration of justice, conduct of public figures, political matters, public bodies and other matters which invite public comment, like sport and plays and books.
* The comment must be based upon facts expressly stated or clearly indicated in the document or speech which contains the defamatory words, or clearly indicated or incorporated by reference. The reference may be by implication, where the facts are well-known, or easily ascertainable.

==== Damages ====
Damages in respect of non-patrimonial loss do not serve a compensatory function, for such loss does not have an economic or pecuniary value. Instead, the emphasis is on providing satisfaction to the plaintiff, in so far as it is possible for an award of money to do so. The purpose of an award under the ''actio iniuriarum'' is to provide solace and assuage wounded feelings. The court exercises its own judgment in the matter and strives to determine awards which will be fair to the plaintiff and the defendant, as well as to the public at large, since such awards also serve to guide future awards.

==== Specific examples of ''iniuria'' ====

===== Infringement of dignity =====
The requirements, as set out in ''[[Delange v Costa]]'',&lt;ref&gt;1989 (2) SA 857 (A).&lt;/ref&gt; are as follows:

* It must be a wrongful and overt act. The test is again of objective reasonableness: The conduct must be objectively offensive or insulting, such that it would have impaired the dignity of a person of ordinary sensitivities. The question to be answered is whether or not an ordinary, decent, right-thinking person would consider such conduct to be insulting.&lt;ref&gt;''Minister of Police v Mbilini'' 1983 (3) SA 705 (A).&lt;/ref&gt; One must also balance conflicting interests and take account of the provisions of the Constitution.
* There must be intention.
* There must be an actual impairment of ''dignitas''. The plaintiff's subjective feelings must have been violated. This is determined subjectively. The plaintiff need not have been aware of the ''injuria'' at the time. (This is the case, for instance, with peeping toms.) The subjective aspect—that is to say, the impairment—may occur later.

If the wrongful act is proved, intention is presumed. The defendant can then try to rebut this presumption. If the defendant fails, the plaintiff must prove the impairment of ''dignitas''. Publication is not required, and the defences are the same as for defamation.

===== Invasion of privacy =====
Invasion of privacy is "wrongful and intentional interference with another's right to seclusion."&lt;ref&gt;Lee and Honore.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the wrongful, intentional and serious disturbance of another's right to enjoy personal peace and privacy and tranquillity. Cases often involve clashes between press freedom and public interest on the one hand, and private personal rights on the other. Privacy can be invaded in various ways:

* Intrusions into private life (by the defendant personally).
* Public disclosures concerning private life (by the defendant to others).
* Disruption of person's peaceful existence.

====== Examples ======
* '''Uninvited obtaining of information''': listening in on private conversations. This includes:
** '''Illegally-obtained information''': unauthorised blood tests.
* '''Publication of photographs''', which must be offensive or embarrassing.
* '''Publication of information''': breach of doctor/patient confidentiality.

====== Defences ======
* Privileged occasion, consent, bona fide mistake, statutory authorisation.
* Justification (truth and public benefit); that the plaintiff is a public figure (but not if the disclosure concerned private issues); previous publicity habits.this also includes actio legis remorunso(meaning changes)

===== Defamation =====
One's ''fama'', [[South African law of delict#Fama|to revise]], is one's reputation or good name; it is other peoples' general opinion, the esteem in which one is held by others.&lt;ref&gt;''Dignitas'', in contrast, is what one thinks of oneself.&lt;/ref&gt;

Defamation is the infringement of one's ''fama'': the unlawful and intentional publication of defamatory matter (by words or by conduct) referring to the plaintiff, which causes his reputation to be impaired. No distinction is made between the libellous (written) and the slanderous (spoken) forms of defamation.

The plaintiff must plead five elements and include a prayer for damages: It must be the (a) wrongful and (b) intentional (c) publication (d) of defamatory material (e) which refers to the plaintiff.

The plaintiff must prove the infringement of the personality right. Then the court will presume that the infringement was wrongful and intentional (but it is open to the defendant to prove otherwise: rebutting presumptions of wrongfulness and intention, usually by proving a defence).

The defendant can oppose defamation with a right of opinion, if his opinion is sincere and based on facts (see [[Freedom of speech]] in South Africa)

The test is objective: Would the words tend to lower the plaintiff in the estimation of right-thinking people and members of society generally? The ''mores'' of the society as a whole are relevant in determining whether or not a statement is defamatory. It is possible, however, to consider the ''mores'' of a particular section of the community in some instances.

Examples include

* imputations against moral character, arousing hatred, contempt and ridicule;
* impairments that cause shunning and avoiding; and
* Impairments of professional or business reputation.

The plaintiff must plead and prove that he is the person defamed. This presents no problem if the plaintiff is named or readily identifiable. The test, again, is objective: Would the ordinary reasonable person hearing or reading the statement understand the matter to refer to the plaintiff?

===== Publication =====
The publication of defamatory matter referring to the plaintiff amounts to the invasion of the right. Publication is the element that distinguishes defamation from other ''injuriae''. Someone else must see you in a worse light than before; otherwise your reputation has not been diminished. If publication is not proved, there is no defamation. But an ''injuria'' or an infringement of a right of privacy could still be present.

'''''Sun Oil Co. v. Wortman''''', [[Case citation|486 U.S. 717]] (1988), was a [[Conflict of laws in the United States|conflict of laws]] case decided by the [[United States Supreme Court]].

==Facts==
The facts were similar to the case of ''[[Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts]]'', also being a [[class action]] lawsuit in [[Kansas]] for overdue interest payments, with plaintiffs from all fifty U.S. states. Here, as opposed to applying it’s ‘whole law,’ Kansas applies its 5 year [[statute of limitations]] instead of the shorter Statutes of Limitations of Louisiana, Texas, or Oklahoma.

==Issue==
Does the use of Kansas law by the courts of the state of Kansas for all plaintiffs violate [[Fourteenth Amendment Due Process]], or the [[Full Faith and Credit clause]]?

==Rule==

The majority opinion, by [[Antonin Scalia|Justice Scalia]], held that there can never be a violation of Fourteenth Amendment Due Process or Full Faith and Credit if a state interprets as procedural something that has been deemed procedural by states in general for hundreds of years. The rule in question being traditional, this was therefore a permissible practice.

A concurring opinion by [[William J. Brennan Jr.|Justice Brennan]], joined by Justices Marshall and Blackmun, asserted that the Court laid down too broad a rule, and that assertions that something is procedural or substantive should be examined on a case-by-case basis. Where the law is partly procedural and partly substantive, the concurrence argued, the Court must weigh how much of each is implicated. In this case, there was no problem because Kansas is not limiting substantive rights granted by other states by allowing plaintiffs to bring these claims for a longer time, the presumption being that other states enact limitations designed to unburden their own courts.

A dissent by Justice O'Connor, joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist, asserted that the Kansas Supreme Court violated the Full Faith and Credit Clause by ignoring statutory interest rates imposed by three other states. 

Justice Kennedy took no part in the case.

'''''Test Claimants in the Franked Investment Income Group Litigation v IRC''''' [2012] UKSC 19 is an [[English unjust enrichment law]] case, concerning liability for overpaid tax, and limitation of claims. The [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]] made a reference to the [[European Court of Justice]] (ECJ).

==Facts==
Companies in two UK groups, with overseas subsidiaries, claimed restitution of [[advance corporation tax]] that was in place from 1973 to 1999, now in section 18 of the [[Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988]]. It treated dividends received by UK resident companies from non-resident subsidiaries differently to dividends paid and received within wholly UK groups. This was contrary to [[European Union law|EU law]], specifically TEC art 43 on [[freedom of establishment]] and TEC art 56 on free movement of capital, and the ECJ said there had to be an effective remedy. ''[[Woolwich Building Society v IRC|Woolwich v IRC]]'' had established that recovery of unlawfully exacted tax could be made. The test claimant argued that section 32(1)(c) of the [[Limitation Act 1980]] allowed extended periods for bringing actions based on mistake, starting from the date of the discovery, and the only point for discovery was the ECJ judgment on 8 March 2001. They started proceedings on 8 September 2003, and the same day the Revenue announced legislation to disapply section 32(1)(c), which came in as the [[Finance Act 2004]], section 320. Also, when the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] judgment of 2006 confirmed a right to claim tax paid under a mistake, Parliament passed the [[Finance Act 2007]] section 107, which disapplied section 32(1)(c) for proceedings brought before 8 September 2003. They used tax relief to reduce liability to pay tax. The tax was unlawful under EU law. The FII Group claimed the money back. It said it would have used the tax relief to reduce other lawful tax liabilities, if it had not already been used to pay the unlawful tax.

==Judgment==

===High Court===
In the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]], [[Launcelot Henderson|Henderson J]] held that a claim under the ''Woolwich'' principle was not an effective remedy, and the EU precluded sections 320 (FA2004) and 107 (FA2007). He used the directness test of causation.

===Court of Appeal===
The [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] held that the ''Woolwich'' remedy was sufficient and EU did not affect section 320 and 107. LA 1980 s 32(1)(c) did not extend to ''Woolwich'' claims and so claims within the 1970 Act s 33 needed to go before the Special Commissioners, not the High Court. HMRC was not unjustly enriched by a payment to discharge a tax liability because the tax liability must have been due under the statute. Even if HMRC was enriched by the value of the claimant’s forgone tax relief credits, and even if the gain would not have been made but for the claimant’s use of the relief, HMRC did not gain at the FII Group’s expense. That would be too remote a consequence of the FII Group’s earlier use of the reliefs.

===Supreme Court===
The Supreme Court held that the FII Group could not recover the majority of overpaid money because the extended limitation period for mistake claims was inapplicable, rather than a claim because of an unlawful demand. But it also allowed a reference to the European Court of Justice on the question of further sums. English law did allow recovery of unlawfully demanded taxes after ''Woolwich''. A separate action was for a mistake of law, including tax paid in ignorance of incompatibility with EU law. The [[Limitation Act 1980]] section 32(1)(c) extended limitations for relief of consequences of a mistake, and required that a mistake led to the claim. This did not extend to restitution for unlawfully demanded tax under the ''Woolwich'' principle. The FII Group were claiming under ''Woolwich'' but had not been able to bring their claim in time, subject to statutory relief under the [[Taxes Management Act 1970]] section 33.

TMA s 33 did not expressly exclude other causes of action at common law, and it could not be implied because that would be inconsistent with EU law. Recovery in restitution was not precluded. Any right of restitution was dependent on an additional domestic law right being protected by EU law. A reference was made to the ECJ asking whether section 320 and 107 offended against the principles of effectiveness, legal certainty or legitimate expectations. Specifically the questions were: (1) did EU principles require the benefit of any special advantage in a limitation; and (2) did section 320 offend those principles? It was clear that section 107 did offend the principles, because it cancelled the claims already brought more than three years after legislation was announced precluding recovery, but excluding claims that had already been brought.

==Significance==
The case could result in the UK government having to pay billions, potentially hundreds of billions, of pounds to corporations.

'''Third World Approaches to International Law (TWAIL)''' is a critical school of [[International legal theories|international legal scholarship]] &lt;ref&gt;O. Okafor, (2005). "Newness, Imperialism, and International Legal Reform in Our Time: A TWAIL Perspective", Osgoode Hall Law Journal 43(1 &amp; 2), p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; and an intellectual and political movement.&lt;ref&gt;M. Mutua, (2000) "What is TWAIL?", Proceedings of the 94th Annual Meeting of the American Society of International Law: pp.31-40, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; It is a "broad dialectic opposition to international law",&lt;ref&gt;M. Mutua, (2000) "What is TWAIL?", Proceedings of the 94th Annual Meeting of the American Society of International Law: pp.31-40, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; which perceives international law as facilitating the continuing exploitation of the [[Third World]] through subordination to the West. TWAIL scholars (known as TWAIL-ers&lt;ref&gt;L. Eslava, and S.  Pahuja, (2011). "Between Resistance and Reform: TWAIL and the Universality of International Law", Trade, Law and Development 3(1), p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;) seek to change what they identify as international law's oppressive aspects,&lt;ref&gt;M. Mutua, (2000) "What is TWAIL?", Proceedings of the 94th Annual Meeting of the American Society of International Law: pp.31-40, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; through the re-examination of the colonial foundations of international law.&lt;ref&gt;M. Mutua, (2000) "What is TWAIL?", Proceedings of the 94th Annual Meeting of the American Society of International Law: pp.31-40, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Early origins (Generation I)===
TWAIL was inspired by the decolonization movements that occurred after [[World War II]]&lt;ref&gt;M. Mutua, (2000) "What is TWAIL?", Proceedings of the 94th Annual Meeting of the American Society of International Law: pp.31-40, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; in Latin America, Africa and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;O. Okafor, (2005). "Newness, Imperialism, and International Legal Reform in Our Time: A TWAIL Perspective", Osgoode Hall Law Journal 43(1 &amp; 2), p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; Symbolically, the conference held in [[Bandung]], [[Indonesia]], in 1955 &lt;ref&gt;M. Mutua, (2000) "What is TWAIL?", Proceedings of the 94th Annual Meeting of the American Society of International Law: pp.31-40, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; is seen as the birthplace of TWAIL, as it was the first attempt by African and Asian states to create a coalition to address the issues specific to the Third World. TWAIL came about to address the material and ethical concerns as well as hardships of the Third World.&lt;ref&gt;B.S. Chimni (2006) "Third World Approaches to international Law: Manifesto", International Community Law Review 8: pp. 3-27, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New age movement (Generation II) ===

The study of TWAIL and its organization originated from a group of [[Harvard Law School]] graduate students in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;J. T. Gathii (2011) "TWAIL: A Brief History of its Origins, its Decentralized Network and a Tentative Bibliography", Trade, Law and Development, 3 (1): pp. 26-48, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent to a conference regarding [[post-colonialism]], [[critical race theory]] and [[law and development]] studies held at Harvard Law School in December 1995, graduate students held a meeting to analyze the viability of creating third world approaches to international law. TWAIL scholars have subsequently held conferences at various universities:

== Objectives ==

TWAIL’s '''main objectives''' include:
*Developing an understanding as to how [[international law]] perpetuates the subordination of non-Europeans to Europeans through international legal norms.&lt;ref&gt;M. Mutua, (2000) "What is TWAIL?", Proceedings of the 94th Annual Meeting of the American Society of International Law: pp.31-40, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;
*Creating opportunities for [[Third World]] participation in international law.&lt;ref&gt;J. T. Gathii (2011) "TWAIL: A Brief History of its Origins, its Decentralized Network and a Tentative Bibliography", Trade, Law and Development, 3 (1): pp. 26-48, p. 8-9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K. Mickelson, (2008) "Taking Stock of TWAIL Histories", 10 INT. COMMUNITY L. REV. 355 p. 357&lt;/ref&gt;  
*Proposing an alternative mechanism of international law that coexists with other critiques of the neoliberal approach to international law &lt;ref&gt;B.S. Chimni (2006) "Third World Approaches to international Law: Manifesto", International Community Law Review 8: pp. 3-27, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;
*Eradicating underdevelopment of the Third World through scholarship, policy and politics&lt;ref&gt;M. Mutua, (2000) "What is TWAIL?", Proceedings of the 94th Annual Meeting of the American Society of International Law: pp.31-40, p.31&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Understanding and engaging Third World scholarship in the analysis of international law.&lt;ref&gt;J. T. Gathii (2011) "TWAIL: A Brief History of its Origins, its Decentralized Network and a Tentative Bibliography", Trade, Law and Development, 3 (1): pp. 26-48, p. 8-9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K. Mickelson, (2008) "Taking Stock of TWAIL Histories", 10 INT. COMMUNITY L. REV. 355 p. 357&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concepts ==

=== Third World ===

The [[Third World]] according to TWAIL-ers, is a group of states, which are politically, economically and culturally diverse, but are simultaneously united in their common history of [[colonialism]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Mutua, (2000) "What is TWAIL?", Proceedings of the 94th Annual Meeting of the American Society of International Law: pp.31-40, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B.S. Chimni (2006) "Third World Approaches to international Law: Manifesto", International Community Law Review 8: pp. 3-27, p. 4-5&lt;/ref&gt; TWAIL emphasizes that even after the end of the [[Cold War]], the Third World is still a political reality.&lt;ref&gt;M. Mutua, (2000) "What is TWAIL?", Proceedings of the 94th Annual Meeting of the American Society of International Law: pp.31-40, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; Some TWAIL-ers believe this distinction to be even more alive today, due to the aggregation of diversification of states based on economic development.&lt;ref&gt;B.S. Chimni (2006) "Third World Approaches to international Law: Manifesto", International Community Law Review 8: pp. 3-27, p. 4-5&lt;/ref&gt; They underline that the maintenance of the unity of the Third World is crucial in combating the continuing domination of the [[First World]] and that the term has no pejorative connotation.&lt;ref&gt;M. Mutua, (2000) "What is TWAIL?", Proceedings of the 94th Annual Meeting of the American Society of International Law: pp.31-40, p. 35 &amp; 36&lt;/ref&gt; The [[First World]] is considered to be the group of states engaged in imperial practices and which continue to dominate global politics and economics.

=== Approaches ===

TWAIL reconsiders the history and development of international law and highlights the colonial legacy inherent in it.&lt;ref&gt;A. Anghie; B.S. Chimni (2003) "Third World Approaches to International Law and Individual Responsibility in Internal Conflicts", Chinese Journal of International Law 2(1): pp. 77-103, p.78 and p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. T. Gathii (2011) "TWAIL: A Brief History of its Origins, its Decentralized Network and a Tentative Bibliography", Trade, Law and Development, 3 (1): pp. 26-48. p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B.S. Chimni (2006) "Third World Approaches to international Law: Manifesto", International Community Law Review 8: pp. 3-27, p. 3 &amp; 7&lt;/ref&gt; TWAIL reevaluates the power relationships of the current world order to eradicate the racial hierarchy and oppression present in international law.&lt;ref&gt;A. Anghie; B.S. Chimni (2003) "Third World Approaches to International Law and Individual Responsibility in Internal Conflicts", Chinese Journal of International Law 2(1): pp. 77-103, p. 78 &amp; 79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. T. Gathii (2011) "TWAIL: A Brief History of its Origins, its Decentralized Network and a Tentative Bibliography", Trade, Law and Development, 3 (1): pp. 26-48. p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B.S. Chimni (2006) "Third World Approaches to international Law: Manifesto", International Community Law Review 8: pp. 3-27, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; Although the goal is common, the methods employed to effect those changes vary. Hence, TWAIL is a diverse and ‘coalitionary movement’&lt;ref&gt;M. Mutua, (2000) "What is TWAIL?", Proceedings of the 94th Annual Meeting of the American Society of International Law: pp.31-40, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. T. Gathii (2011) "TWAIL: A Brief History of its Origins, its Decentralized Network and a Tentative Bibliography", Trade, Law and Development, 3 (1): pp. 26-48. p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; - its scholars use different methodologies like [[Marxism]], [[feminism]] and [[critical race theory]]. Therefore there is no elaborate common TWAIL doctrine,&lt;ref&gt;M. Mutua, (2000) "What is TWAIL?", Proceedings of the 94th Annual Meeting of the American Society of International Law: pp.31-40, p.36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. T. Gathii (2011) "TWAIL: A Brief History of its Origins, its Decentralized Network and a Tentative Bibliography", Trade, Law and Development, 3 (1): pp. 26-48. p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; but all TWAIL-ers are nevertheless united in their struggle for the greater involvement of Third World peoples in international law.

=== International Law ===

TWAIL-ers underline that [[international law]] was created during the colonial era and that it was used to legitimize the global processes of marginalization and domination of the colonized people by Western powers.&lt;ref&gt;J. T. Gathii (2011) "TWAIL: A Brief History of its Origins, its Decentralized Network and a Tentative Bibliography", Trade, Law and Development, 3 (1): pp. 26-48. p. 26, 34, 38&lt;/ref&gt; They refuse to accept the universal character of the international legal system, as it emerged solely from the European and Christian tradition.&lt;ref&gt;J. T. Gathii (2011) "TWAIL: A Brief History of its Origins, its Decentralized Network and a Tentative Bibliography", Trade, Law and Development, 3 (1): pp. 26-48. p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Mutua, (2000) "What is TWAIL?", Proceedings of the 94th Annual Meeting of the American Society of International Law: pp.31-40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B.S. Chimni (2006) "Third World Approaches to international Law: Manifesto", International Community Law Review 8: pp. 3-27, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Anghie; B.S. Chimni (2003) "Third World Approaches to International Law and Individual Responsibility in Internal Conflicts", Chinese Journal of International Law 2(1): pp. 77-103, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Third World countries were assimilated by force into the international legal system, which does not reflect their diverse heritage. TWAIL-ers reject the idea that after the end of the World War II international law has moved on from its imperialistic origins. Although the system appears to be legitimized by recognizing human rights and the right to self-determination, TWAIL-ers believe that international law is still a tool of oppression and that [[decolonization]] processes were merely illusory.&lt;ref&gt;M. Mutua, (2000) "What is TWAIL?", Proceedings of the 94th Annual Meeting of the American Society of International Law: pp.31-40, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. T. Gathii (2011) "TWAIL: A Brief History of its Origins, its Decentralized Network and a Tentative Bibliography", Trade, Law and Development, 3 (1): pp. 26-48, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst the modern forms of domination, TWAIL-ers include:

*the limitation of the Third World states’ [[sovereignty]] through transferring their autonomous powers to international institutions controlled by the First World,
*the arbitrary application of the [[humanitarian intervention]] and
*the internationalization of proprietary rights .

TWAIL-ers also emphasize the inability of Third World leaders to secure the interests of their people and their failed opposition to the First World hegemony, which further hinders the struggle for liberation of Third World peoples . However, TWAIL highlights that some concepts in international law simultaneously serve as both an instrument of oppression and emancipation – like the [[international human rights regime]], which not only justifies the internationalization of property rights but also the protection peoples’ freedoms . Hence TWAIL-ers recognize that some elements of the system need to be preserved.

== Scholars ==

TWAIL is not a uniform school of thought and TWAIL-ers do not take a unanimous stance. Some of them are more reconstructionist while others are more oppositional&lt;ref&gt;O. Okafor, (2005). "Newness, Imperialism, and International Legal Reform in Our Time: A TWAIL Perspective", Osgoode Hall Law Journal 43(1 &amp; 2). p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; in their approach. Nevertheless, the scholars, in a decentralized network, share a common concern for the Third World.&lt;ref&gt;J. T. Gathii (2011) "TWAIL: A Brief History of its Origins, its Decentralized Network and a Tentative Bibliography", Trade, Law and Development, 3 (1): pp. 26-48. p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Some of them teach TWAIL courses at various universities around the world.

== Criticism ==
TWAIL-ers are sometimes accused of having a [[nihilism|nihilistic]] approach. [[David P. Fidler]]&lt;ref&gt;J. T. Gathii (2011) "TWAIL: A Brief History of its Origins, its Decentralized Network and a Tentative Bibliography", Trade, Law and Development, 3 (1): pp. 26-48. p. 43 and D.P. Fidler, (2003) "Revolt Against or From Within the West? TWAIL, the Developing World, and the Future Direction of International Law", 2(1) Chinese Journal of International Law 29.&lt;/ref&gt; and Jose Alvarez criticize TWAIL for offering no positive agenda for action or reform in international law and relations. Alvarez uses the example of the [[genocide in Sudan]] and TWAIL-ers’ refusal to subscribe to the lobbying of the [[Security Council]] to take desired action in the case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://opiniojuris.org/2010/09/28/my-summer-vacation-part-iii-revisiting-twail-in-paris/ J. Alvarez, "My Summer Vacation Part II: Revisiting TWAIL in Paris"]&lt;/ref&gt; Alvarez’s own work contains many TWAIL-like themes and he has often been just as critical of certain liberal approaches to international law as TWAIL scholarship has been.  Post-structuralist critiques of TWAIL assert that the argumentative logic of TWAIL ultimately operates according to the very conservative analytical framework it sets out to transcend.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2481693/ J. Haskell, "TRAIL-ing TWAIL: Arguments and Blind Spots in Third World Approaches to International Law"]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are First World scholars who reject Third World scholarship, which, in the view of TWAIL-ers, reflects TWAIL’s growing impact on the debate on international law.&lt;ref&gt;M.W. Janis, (1983) "Towards a New International Order by Mohammed Bedjaoui", 6 B.C. INT’L &amp; COMP. L. REV. 355. p. 359&lt;/ref&gt; Notwithstanding, TWAIL-ers continue to make, what they perceive as necessary critique and essential reform proposals to promote justice, equality and egalitarian values in [[international law]].&lt;ref&gt;J. T. Gathii (2011) "TWAIL: A Brief History of its Origins, its Decentralized Network and a Tentative Bibliography", Trade, Law and Development, 3 (1): pp. 26-48. p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Tulane.Maritime.Law.Journal.JPG|left|thumb|190px|The '''''Tulane Maritime Law Journal''''' [[Steering wheel (ship)|ship steering wheel]] adorns the entrance to the journal's student offices in Weinmann Hall.]]
The '''''Tulane Maritime Law Journal''''' is the preeminent student-edited [[law journal]] in the field of [[Admiralty law|Admiralty and Maritime Law]]. Published semi-annually, each issue of the Journal  includes scholarly works written by academics, practitioners, and students concerning current topics in Admiralty and Maritime Law. In addition, the Journal publishes an annual section on Recent Developments in Admiralty and Maritime Law for the United States and the international community, as well as periodic symposia on relevant topical areas in the field and quantum, collision, and forum selection clause surveys every other year.

The Tulane Maritime Law Journal launched a  new website on August 28, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tulanemaritimejournal.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Articles==
The Journal has been cited by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] many times—most recently, in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-1198.pdf|title=STOLT-NIELSEN S. A. ET AL. v. ANIMALFEEDS INTERNATIONAL CORP|publisher=supremecourt.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Court also cited the Journal in 2009, when it relied, in part, on an article by New York maritime attorney Paul S. Edelman (''Guevara v. Maritime Overseas Corp.'', 20 Tul. Mar. L. J. 349 (1996)).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.tulane.edu/tlsNews/newsItem.aspx?id=11182|title=Tulane University Law School - News Item Detail|publisher=law.tulane.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Tulane Maritime Law Journal was founded in 1973 in conjunction with the student-run Tulane Maritime Law Society. The first issue of the Journal was released in March 1975 as The Maritime Lawyer. The next few years were formative and interesting times for the Journal, a history that is retraced in the 20th Anniversary issue (Volume 20, Issue 1). In the fall of 1977, the Journal established its independence from the Tulane Maritime Law Society. Since that fall, the Journal has been published every winter and summer. Starting with Volume 12, in 1987, the publication changed its name from The Maritime Lawyer to the Tulane Maritime Law Journal. The name change was to better reflect the Journal’s status as a student-edited law journal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tulanemaritimejournal.org/history/|title=History|publisher=tulanemaritimejournal.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Unceremonious Treatment of the Russian Ultimatum.jpg|thumb|right|314px|The 1853 negotiations between Russian envoy, [[Alexander Sergeyevich Menshikov|Prince Menshikov]], and the [[Abdülmecid I|Turkish Sultan]] about the protection of [[Orthodox Christian]]s in the [[Ottoman Empire]] involved a series of ultimata.  On 31 May, Russia threatened that the provinces of [[Moldova]] and [[Wallachia]] would be occupied if Menshikov's note was not accepted within seven days.  This ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' cartoon satirises rejection of the ultimatum by Austria, France and Turkey while Britain watches, amused.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |chapter=The Crimean War Crisis, 1853-1854 |title=Crisis Diplomacy |pages=69–105 |author=James L. Richardson |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=1994 |isbn=9780521459877}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]  
An '''ultimatum''' ({{lang-la|the last one}}) is a [[demand]] whose fulfillment is requested in a specified period of time and which is backed up by a [[coercion|threat]] to be followed through in case of noncompliance (open loop). An ultimatum is generally the final demand in a series of requests. As such, the time allotted is usually short, and the request is understood not to be open to further [[negotiation]]. The threat which backs up the ultimatum can vary depending on the demand in question and on the other circumstances.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

The word is used in [[diplomacy]] to signify the final terms submitted by one of the parties in negotiation for settlement of any subject of disagreement. It is accompanied by an intimation as to how refusal will be regarded. English diplomacy has devised the adroit reservation that refusal will be regarded as an "unfriendly act", a phrase which serves as a warning that the consequences of the rupture of negotiations will be considered from the point of view of forcing a settlement. This opens up a variety of possibilities, such as good offices, [[mediation]], the appointment of a commission of inquiry, [[arbitration]], [[Reprisal|reprisals]], [[pacific blockade]] and [[war]].{{efn|To these may be added a new unofficial method devised by the Turks in connexion with the Austro-Turkish difficulty over the annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, viz. the boycotting of the goods and ships of the natives of the state against which the grievance exists. This is a method open to weaker as against more powerful states, which can have serious coercive and even complicated consequences under the influence of democratic institutions.}}

==Deterrence ==


Unlike the circumstances of an ultimatum, the scenario of deterrence is not bound by specific constraints of time, place, or action, and though a threat may be present, there is no formal guarantee of it being acted out. The scenario of nuclear deterrence (particularly the United States and the Soviet Union in the [[Cold War]]) is a good example of this concept: while both nations maintained a sizeable stockpile of nuclear weapons aimed at each other, the intent was to prevent open conflict (closed loop), and that no formal condition for initiating conflict was ever established, except in retaliation for the other side initiating an attack. In an ultimatum situation, either nation would threaten the use of nuclear weapons if certain demands/constraints were not met independent of that retaliatory capability that would have a fixed point of no return—compliance or warfare.

==Requirement for military action==
An ultimatum may also serve to provide legitimacy for military action.

==International law==
The [[Hague Convention of 1907|Hague Convention]] relative to the Opening of Hostilities of 18 October 1907, provides as follows:

{{Blockquote|"Considering that it is important, in order to ensure the maintenances of pacific relations, that hostilities should not commence without previous warning," it is agreed by the Contracting Powers to "recognize that hostilities between them must not commence without a previous and explicit warning in the form of either a [[declaration of war]], giving reasons, or an ultimatum with a conditional declaration of war."}}

As reasons for a declaration of war are necessarily in the nature of an ultimatum, the ultimatum may now be regarded as an indispensable formality precedent to the outbreak of hostilities.

Another Hague convention of the same date respecting the limitation of the employment of force for the recovery of contract debts provides as follows:

{{Blockquote|"Being desirous of preventing between nations armed conflicts originating in a pecuniary dispute respecting contract debts claimed from the government of one country by the government of another country as due to its subjects or citizens," the Contracting Powers agree "not to have recourse to armed force for the recovery of contract debts claimed from the government of one country by the government of another country as being due to its subjects or citizens."}}

This undertaking, however, is not applicable when the debtor state refuses or neglects to reply to an offer of arbitration or, "after accepting the offer, renders the settlement of the compromis impossible, or, after the arbitration, fails to comply with the award."

Under this convention, in the cases to which it relates, the alternative of the ultimatum is ipso facto arbitration, and it is only when the conditions of the convention have been set at naught that other measures may be employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Ultimatum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subsequent to the United Nations Charter===

The United Nations Charter &lt;ref&gt;Article 2(4)&lt;/ref&gt; prohibits not only the use of force but also the threat of such use of force, but there is discussion on whether this prohibition applies only to (militarily) credible threats, whether (or when) the threat of the use of force in self-defence is permitted, and what actions (not necessarily accompanied by a verbal threat) can be considered a threat. {{Sfn| Grimal |2012|loc=Introduction}} 
The [[International Court of Justice]] has provided guidance on the legality of the use of threats: generally, if the use of force would be lawful, the threat of such use of force is also legal, and if the actual use of force is later found lawful, then the prior threat is also deemed lawful.{{Sfn| Grimal |2012|loc=Introduction}}

==Advantages and disadvantages==
The actor that presents the other side with an ultimatum should be prepared to make good on the threat, for instance, initiate military action, if the other side does not comply with its demands.{{Sfn|George|2003|p=xi}} 
There are dangers if the threatened actor decides not to comply. On the one hand, if the actor presenting the ultimatum is not willing to go through with the threatened action, the other actor may "call their bluff" presenting a choice between a humiliating climb-down and an unwanted result (such as war). 
On the other hand, the opponent may take the ultimatum seriously and take pre-emptive action.{{Sfn|George|2003|pp=xi-xii}}
The ultimatum may encourage the opponent to remain firm so as not to be seen as weak.{{Sfn |George | 2003 |pp=xi-xii}}

One danger here is that the opponent may profess to accept the ultimatum, possibly with conditions, thus weakening the credibility of the issuer of the ultimatum.{{Sfn |George | 2003 |pp=xi-xii}}

Another danger is that the issuer may keep negotiating with the opponent when the requested period of time ends, thus making the issuer look like a laughable fool.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2013/05/16/2003562396 TAIPEI-MANILA ROW: Premier ‘sorry’ over delayed measures] May 16, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division''' is a law enforcement agency responsible for enforcing the [[United States antitrust law|antitrust laws of the United States]]. It shares jurisdiction over [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] antitrust cases with the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) and often works jointly with the FTC to provide regulatory guidance to businesses. However, the Antitrust Division also has the power to file criminal cases against willful violators of the antitrust laws. The Antitrust Division also works with [[competition regulator]]s in other countries.

==Leadership==
The head of the Antitrust Division is an Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust (AAG-AT) appointed by the [[President of the United States]].  The current{{when|date=March 2018}} Assistant Attorney General is [[Makan Delrahim]].

==History==
On February 25, 1903, Congress earmarked $500,000 for antitrust enforcement. On March 3, 1903, Congress created the position of Antitrust AG, with a salary to be paid out of the funds earmarked for antitrust enforcement. The 1904 DOJ ''Register'' identified two professional staffers responsible for enforcement of antitrust laws, but it wasn't until 1919 that the Division was formally established. AG [[A. Mitchell Palmer]] “effected the first important reorganization" of DOJ since it was first established in 1870. Palmer organized DOJ into divisions, and placed the AtAG “in charge of the Anti-Trust Division.” Palmer's annual report for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1919 contained the first public statement that DOJ had a component called the "The Antitrust Division." &lt;ref&gt;[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3226941 Gregory J. Werden, Establishment of the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
{{outdated|section|date=April 2015}}
The Antitrust Division is overseen by an Assistant Attorney General.  The Assistant Attorney General is assisted by six Deputy Assistant Attorneys General (DAAG) who each oversee a different branch of the Division.  One of the DAAGs holds the position of "Principal Deputy," that is "first among equals," and "will typically assume the powers of the Assistant Attorney General in the Assistant Attorney General’s absence."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.justice.gov/atr/file/761166/download|title=Antitrust Division Manual|last=|first=|publisher=U.S. Dep't of Justice|year=April 2015 |pages=I–4|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Closing of Field Offices ==
The closure of four of the Antitrust Division's criminal antitrust offices in January 2013 generated significant controversy within the Division and among members of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law360.com/articles/406994/doj-s-antitrust-plans-unclear-amid-looming-office-closures|title=DOJ's Antitrust Plans Unclear Amid Looming Office Closures - Law360|website=www.law360.com|language=en|access-date=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law360.com/articles/336430?scroll=1|title=Kohl Urges DOJ To Reconsider Antitrust Office Closings - Law360|website=www.law360.com|language=en|access-date=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law360.com/articles/312416?scroll=1|title=DOJ Faces Mounting Flak Over Plan To Close Antitrust Offices - Law360|website=www.law360.com|language=en|access-date=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Attorney General posited that the closure of these offices will save money and not negatively affect criminal enforcement.  A significant number of career prosecutors have voiced contrary opinions, noting that the elimination of half of the Division's criminal enforcement offices will increase travel expenses and diminish the likelihood of uncovering local or regional conspiracies.

'''Vauban''' is a [[neighbourhood]] to the south of the town centre in [[Freiburg]], [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}}[http://www.vauban.de/info/abstract.html Introduction to Vauban district, Freiburg]&lt;/ref&gt; It was built as "a [[Sustainable design|sustainable]] model district" on the site of a former [[French military]] base named after [[Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban]], the 17th century [[Marshal of France|French Marshal]] who built fortifications in Freiburg while the region was under French rule. Construction began in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Melia|first1=Steve|title=On the Road to Sustainability: Transport and Carfree Living in Freiburg|url=http://www.stevemelia.co.uk/vauban.htm|website=stevemelia.co.uk|accessdate=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the year 2001 the first 2000 residents moved in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An introduction to Vauban district|url=http://www.vauban.de/en/topics/history|website=vauban.de|accessdate=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sustainable building==
[[Image:Ecoquartier Vauban Freibourg3.JPG|thumb|Wooden panelling on some façades]] 
All houses are built to a low-energy consumption standard, with 100 units designed to the ''[[Passive house|Passivhaus]]'' [[low-energy building|ultra-low energy building]] standard.&lt;ref name="CEPHEUS"&gt;[http://www.passivehouse.com/07_eng/news/CEPHEUS_final_long.pdf CEPHEUS Final Report on as-built thermal performance]&lt;/ref&gt; Other buildings are heated by a [[Cogeneration|combined heat and power station]] burning wood chips, while many of the buildings have [[Solar thermal collector|solar collectors]] or [[Solar cell|photovoltaic cells]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.passivhaus-vauban.de/idee.en.html Delleske, Andreas: ''Passivhaus Wohnen &amp; Arbeiten'']&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the best example of sustainable building is the [[Solar Settlement]] in Vauban, a 59 [[PlusEnergy]] home housing community. It is the first housing community worldwide in which all the homes produce a positive energy balance. The solar energy surplus is then sold back into the city's grid for a profit on every home.&lt;ref name="Rolf Disch Solararchitektur"&gt;[http://hosting.more-elements.com/MoccaMS/projects/plusenergie/index.php?p=home&amp;pid=266&amp;L=0&amp;host=2 Rolf Disch Solararchitektur]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transport==
Within Vauban, transport is primarily by foot or [[bicycle]]. The development is connected to [[Freiburg]] city centre by a [[tram]]way and is laid out linearly along the tracks, such that all homes are within easy walking distance from a tram stop. As of 2009, around 70% of the households had chosen to live without a private [[Automobile|car]]. The level of car ownership has fallen over time. 

Both this and an earlier study&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.istp.murdoch.edu.au/ISTP/publications/jscheurer/carfree/carfree.html Scheurer, J., 2001. Urban Ecology, Innovations in Housing Policy and the Future of Cities: Towards Sustainability in Neighbourhood Communities. PhD edn. Perth: Murdoch University Institute of Sustainable Transport.]&lt;/ref&gt; found that cycling was the main mode of transport for most trips and most activities, including commuting and shopping.

[[File:VaubanTraficNetwork-Schematic.png|thumb|A diagrammatic depiction of the transportation network in Vauban. It shows the departure from the traditional simple grid and the adoption of a complex combination grid. The drawing shows the three types of connectors: roads in red, local streets in orange and pedestrian bicycle paths in green]]
The preference for walking and cycling can be partly attributed to the layout of the district. Building on previous experience, the plan departs from the simple inherited grid and creates a network, which incorporates the principle of “[[Permeability (spatial and transport planning)|filtered permeability]]”. It means that the network geometry favours the active modes of transport and, selectively, “filters out” the car. This is accomplished by reducing the number of streets that run through the neighbourhood. Instead, most local streets are crescents and [[cul-de-sac]]s (see drawing). While they are discontinuous for cars, they connect to a network of pedestrian and bike paths, which permeate the entire neighbourhood. In addition, these paths go through or past open spaces, adding to the enjoyment of the trip. The logic of filtering a mode of transport is fully expressed in a new comprehensive model for laying out neighbourhoods and districts – the [[Fused Grid]].

Most of Vauban's residential streets are described as ''stellplatzfrei'' – literally "free from parking spaces". Vehicles are allowed down these streets at walking pace to pick up and deliver but not to park, although there are some infractions as the system depends essentially on social consensus – there are few [[Police|official]] controls. Each year, households are required to sign a declaration stating either that they do not own a car, or that they do, in which case they must buy a space in one of the multi-storey car parks on the periphery, at a one-off cost of €17,500 plus a monthly service fee (in 2006). The citywide car sharing club has the greatest concentration of its 2,500 members in Vauban – at least ten of its cars are stationed around the district.&lt;ref name="melia"&gt;Melia, S., 2006.

[[University of the West of England]].] 
&lt;/ref&gt;

==History ==

The site was originally developed as a military base in 1936 and was taken over after [[World War II]] by the French forces occupying the region. The military left in 1992. Over a period of some years the vacant structures were occupied by various tribes of [[hippies]] and [[anarchists]]. Following battles with the city government, squatters won the rights to four of the original twenty barracks. At the same time a group called "Forum Vauban" was pressing the City Council to develop the site in an eco-friendly way. The remaining 38 hectares were acquired by Freiburg City Council, who delegated the mandatory community consultation to Forum Vauban. This collaboration between the Council and Forum Vauban led to the masterplan with its car-free concept.

Most of the individual plots were sold to ''Baugruppen'' (co-housing groups) whose bids were assessed against criteria favouring families with children, older people and Freiburg residents. Some Baugruppen were formed by architects, others by prospective residents planning varying elements of self-build. Some of the other plots were sold to private developers.&lt;ref name="melia"/&gt;

Another part of the site was developed for student dormitories for the [[University of Freiburg]]. Some former occupants of these structures have taken up residence in a diverse assortment of cars, vans, and retired civil service vehicles, forming what has been named Wagenplatz.

More "alternative" projects have, among other things, converted old barracks at a low cost, such as S.U.S.I., a self-governing independent residential initiative that, through an alternative living concept, developed living spaces for students as well as [[Social welfare|subsidized housing]]. A self-governing "[[Community centre|Community Centre]] Building 037" ({{lang-de|Stadtteilzentrum Haus 037}}) has been established in one of the preserved [[barracks]]. Some former barracks were occupied in early 2005, as they would have been [[Demolition|demolished]].

Vauban has 5,500 residents as of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rosenthal|first1=Elisabeth|title=In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/12/science/earth/12suburb.html?_r=0|website=https://www.nytimes.com/|accessdate=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wikipedia Zero''' is a project by the [[Wikimedia Foundation]] to provide [[Wikipedia]] free of charge on mobile phones via [[zero-rating]], particularly in [[developing markets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.technobuffalo.com/2013/02/22/wikipedia-zero-sms/|title=Wikipedia Zero Wants to Bring Wikipedia to Mobile Users Without a Data Plan|first=Brandon|last=Russell|accessdate=April 8, 2013|date=February 22, 2013|work=TechnoBuffalo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knightfoundation.org/blogs/knightblog/2013/2/22/getting-wikipedia-people-who-need-it-most/|title=Getting Wikipedia to the people who need it most|date=February 22, 2013|publisher=Knight Foundation|accessdate=April 8, 2013|first=Kul Takanao|last=Wadhwa}}&lt;/ref&gt; The objective of the program was to increase access to free knowledge, in particular without data-usage cost. With 97 operators in over 72 countries, it is estimated that access to Wikipedia was provided to more than 800 million people through this program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Wikipedia_Zero|title=Wikipedia Zero - Wikimedia Foundation|last=|first=|date=|website=wikimediafoundation.org|language=en|access-date=February 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wikipedia Zero program will end in 2018.

We believe in [[Net neutrality in the United States|net neutrality in America]]", while adding that Wikipedia Zero required a different perspective in other countries: "Partnering with telecom companies in the near term, it blurs the net neutrality line in those areas. It fulfills our overall mission, though, which is providing free knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/11/25/wikipedias-complicated-relationship-with-net-neutrality/|title=Wikipedia's 'complicated' relationship with net neutrality|work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hilary Heuler argues that "for many, zero-rated programs would limit online access to the 'walled gardens' offered by the web heavyweights. For millions of users, Facebook and Wikipedia would be synonymous with 'internet'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/who-really-wins-from-facebooks-free-internet-plan-for-africa |title=Who really wins from Facebook's 'free internet' plan for Africa?|author=Hilary Heuler|work=ZDNet}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, researchers evaluating how the similar program Facebook Zero shapes [[information and communications technology]] use in the [[developing world]] found that 11% of Indonesians who said they used Facebook also said they did not use the Internet. 65% of Nigerians, and  61% of Indonesians agree with the statement that "Facebook is the Internet" compared with only 5% in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qz.com/333313/milliions-of-facebook-users-have-no-idea-theyre-using-the-internet/|title=Millions of Facebook users have no idea they're using the internet|author=Leo Mirani|date=February 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An article in ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' magazine notes that the free access via Wikipedia Zero made Wikipedia a preferred way for its users in Bangladesh and elsewhere to share copyrighted material. This caused problems at Wikipedia (where uploading copyrighted media is discouraged) but the article is deeply critical of the Wikipedia Zero project, arguing that because "they can't afford access to [[YouTube]] and the rest of the internet, Wikipedia has become the internet for lots of [[Bangladesh]]is [and] a bunch of more-or-less random editors who happen to want to be the piracy police are dictating the means of access for an entire population of people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Koebler|first=Jason|title=Wikipedia's Piracy Police Are Ruining the Developing World's Internet Experience|newspaper=Motherboard|publisher=Vice Media|date=March 27, 2016|url =https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/wikipedia-zero-being-surveilled-by-piracy-police|access-date=June 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
