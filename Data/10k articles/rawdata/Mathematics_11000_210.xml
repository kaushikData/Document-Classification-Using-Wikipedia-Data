      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1828">In mathematics, '''Bendixson's inequality''' is a quantitative result in the field of [[Matrix_(mathematics)|matrices]] derived by [[Ivar Bendixson]] in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=An Introduction to Linear Algebra |page=210 |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=TteOFYtbIVQC&amp;pg=PA436&amp;lpg=PA436&amp;dq=Bendixson%27s+inequality&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GkcabzOMdn&amp;sig=_DtaHorleY76VJl9RwGes4WzlAQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiwkpDcy4beAhUUU30KHVp_AEkQ6AEwBXoECAMQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Bendixson's%20inequality&amp;f=false |accessdate=14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inequality puts limits on the imaginary parts of [[Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors|Characteristic roots]] (Eigen values) of real matrices. A special case of this inequality leads to the result that characteristic roots of a real matrix are always real.

Mathematically, the inequality is stated as:

Let &lt;math&gt;A = \left ( a_{ij} \right )&lt;/math&gt; be a real &lt;math&gt;n \times n&lt;/math&gt; matrix and &lt;math&gt;\alpha = \max_{{1\leq i,j \leq n}} \frac{1}{2} \left | a_{ij} - a_{ji} \right |&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is any characteristic root of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, then

: &lt;math&gt;\left | \operatorname{Im} (\lambda) \right | \le \alpha \sqrt{\frac{n(n-1)} 2 }.\,{} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Iterative Solution Methods |page=633 |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=hNpJg_pUsOwC&amp;pg=PA633&amp;lpg=PA633&amp;dq=Bendixson%27s+inequality&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8Na4f9eWXg&amp;sig=Bfml-4gRSaxiXgehrvQw9IeLPMY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj_rrWL2YbeAhWWXSsKHeZMAQoQ6AEwBnoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Bendixson's%20inequality&amp;f=false |accessdate=14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is [[symmetric matrix|symmetric]] then &lt;math&gt;\alpha = 0&lt;/math&gt; and consequently the inequality implies that &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; must be real.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2027">In [[mathematics]], '''Birch's theorem''',&lt;ref&gt;B. J. Birch, ''Homogeneous forms of odd degree in a large number of variables'', Mathematika, '''4''', pages 102–105 (1957)&lt;/ref&gt; named for [[Bryan John Birch]], is a statement about the representability of zero by odd degree forms.

==Statement of Birch's theorem==
Let ''K'' be an [[algebraic number field]], ''k'', ''l'' and ''n'' be natural numbers, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;,''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; be odd natural numbers, and ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;,''f''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; be [[homogeneous polynomial]]s with coefficients in ''K'' of degrees ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;,''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; respectively in ''n'' variables, then there exists a number ψ(''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;,''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;,''l'',''K'') such that
:&lt;math&gt;n\ge\psi(r_1,\ldots,r_k,l,K)&lt;/math&gt;
implies that there exists an ''l''-dimensional vector subspace ''V'' of ''K''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;f_1(x)=\cdots = f_k(x)=0,\quad\forall x\in V.&lt;/math&gt;

==Remarks==
The proof of the theorem is by [[mathematical induction|induction]] over the maximal degree of the forms ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;,''f''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;. Essential to the proof is a special case, which can be proved by an application of the [[Hardy–Littlewood circle method]], of the theorem which states that if ''n'' is sufficiently large and ''r'' is odd, then the equation

:&lt;math&gt;c_1x_1^r+\cdots+c_nx_n^r=0,\quad c_i\in\mathbb{Z}, i=1,\ldots,n&lt;/math&gt;

has a solution in integers ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, not all of which are&amp;nbsp;0.

The restriction to odd ''r'' is necessary, since even-degree forms, such as [[Quadratic_form#Definiteness_of_a_quadratic_form|positive definite quadratic form]]s, may take the value 0 only at the origin.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4005">In [[computational complexity theory]] and [[circuit complexity]], a '''Boolean circuit''' is a mathematical [[model of computation|model]] for [[digital electronics|digital logic circuits]]. A [[formal language]] can be decided by a family of Boolean circuits, one circuit for each possible input length. Boolean circuits are also used as a formal model for [[combinational logic]] in digital electronics.

Boolean circuits are defined in terms of the [[logic gate]]s they contain. For example, a circuit might contain [[binary function|binary]] AND and OR gates and [[unary operation|unary]] NOT gates, or be entirely described by binary [[NAND gate]]s. Each gate corresponds to some [[Boolean function]] that takes a fixed number of [[bit]]s as input and outputs a single bit.

Boolean circuits provide a model for many digital components used in [[computer engineering]], including [[multiplexer]]s, [[adder (electronics)|adder]]s, and [[arithmetic logic unit]]s.

== Formal definition ==
In giving a formal definition of Boolean circuits, [[Heribert Vollmer|Vollmer]] starts by defining a basis set ''B'' of Boolean functions, corresponding to the gates allowable in the circuit model. A Boolean circuit over a basis ''B'', with ''n'' inputs and ''m'' outputs, is then defined as a finite [[directed acyclic graph]]. Each vertex corresponds to either a basis function or one of the inputs, and there is a set of exactly ''m'' nodes which are labeled as the outputs.&lt;ref&gt;Vollmer 1999, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The edges must also have some ordering, to distinguish between different arguments to the same Boolean function.&lt;ref&gt;Vollmer 1999, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a special case, a [[propositional formula]] or [[Boolean expression]] is a Boolean circuit with a single output node in which every other node has [[fan-out]] of 1.  Thus, a Boolean circuit can be regarded as a generalization that allows shared subformulas and multiple outputs.

A common basis for Boolean circuits is the set {[[AND gate|AND]], [[OR gate|OR]], [[NOT gate|NOT]]}, from which all other Boolean functions can be constructed.

== Computational complexity ==

=== Evaluation of a circuit ===
The [[Circuit Value Problem]], the problem of computing the output of a given Boolean circuit on a given input [[binary string|string]], is a [[P-complete]] [[decision problem]].&lt;ref name="arorabarak"&gt;{{cite book|author=S. Arora|author2=B. Barak|last-author-amp=yes|title=Computational complexity, a modern approach|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, this problem is considered to be "inherently sequential" in the sense that there is likely no efficient, highly parallel algorithm that solves the problem.

=== Complexity measures ===
{{See also|Circuit complexity}}
Several important [[Computational complexity theory|complexity measures]] can be defined on Boolean circuits, including circuit depth, circuit size, and number of alternations between AND gates and OR gates. For example, the size complexity of a Boolean circuit is the number of gates.

=== Complexity classes ===
{{Main article|Circuit complexity#Complexity classes}}
Several important complexity classes are defined in terms of Boolean circuits, including [[NC (complexity)|NC]]. NC is defined to be the set of [[Boolean function]]s that can be decided by uniform Boolean circuits of polynomial size and polylogarithmic depth. Here, the word ''uniform'' means that there must be some condition on the circuit family so that a description of a circuit can be computed from only the number of inputs to the circuit.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12769">In mathematics, a '''canonical basis''' is a basis of an algebraic structure that is canonical in a sense that depends on the precise context:

* In a coordinate space, and more generally in a free module, it refers to the [[standard basis]] defined by the [[Kronecker delta]].
* In a polynomial ring, it refers to its standard basis given by the [[monomial]]s, &lt;math&gt;(X^i)_i&lt;/math&gt;.
* For finite extension fields, it means the [[polynomial basis]].
* In [[linear algebra]], it refers to a set of ''n'' linearly independent [[generalized eigenvector]]s of an ''n''×''n'' matrix &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, if the set is composed entirely of [[Jordan chain]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bronson|1970|p=196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Representation theory==
In representation theory there are several bases that are called "canonical", for example, Lusztig's canonical basis and closely related Kashiwara's [[crystal basis]] in quantum groups and their representations. There is a general concept underlying these basis:

Consider the ring of integral [[Laurent polynomial]]s &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Z}:=\mathbb{Z}[v,v^{-1}]&lt;/math&gt; with its two subrings &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Z}^{\pm}:=\mathbb{Z}[v^{\pm 1}]&lt;/math&gt; and the automorphism &lt;math&gt;\overline{\cdot}&lt;/math&gt; defined by &lt;math&gt;\overline{v}:=v^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

A ''precanonical structure'' on a free &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Z}&lt;/math&gt;-module &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; consists of
* A ''standard'' basis &lt;math&gt;(t_i)_{i\in I}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;,
* An interval finite [[partial order]] on &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;, that is, &lt;math&gt;(-\infty,i] := \{j\in I \mid j\leq i\}&lt;/math&gt; is finite for all &lt;math&gt;i\in I&lt;/math&gt;,
* A dualization operation, that is, a bijection &lt;math&gt;F\to F&lt;/math&gt; of order two that is &lt;math&gt;\overline{\cdot}&lt;/math&gt;-[[semilinear map|semilinear]] and will be denoted by &lt;math&gt;\overline{\cdot}&lt;/math&gt; as well.

If a precanonical structure is given, then one can define the &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Z}^{\pm}&lt;/math&gt; submodule &lt;math&gt;F^{\pm} := \sum \mathcal{Z}^{\pm} t_j&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;.

A ''canonical basis at &lt;math&gt;v=0&lt;/math&gt;'' of the precanonical structure is then a &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Z}&lt;/math&gt;-basis &lt;math&gt;(c_i)_{i\in I}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; that satisfies:
* &lt;math&gt;\overline{c_i}=c_i&lt;/math&gt; and
* &lt;math&gt;c_i \in \sum_{j\leq i} \mathcal{Z}^+ t_j \text{ and } c_i \equiv t_i \mod vF^+&lt;/math&gt;
for all &lt;math&gt;i\in I&lt;/math&gt;. A ''canonical basis at &lt;math&gt;v=\infty&lt;/math&gt;'' is analogously defined to be a basis &lt;math&gt;(\widetilde{c}_i)_{i\in I}&lt;/math&gt; that satisfies
* &lt;math&gt;\overline{\widetilde{c}_i}=\widetilde{c}_i&lt;/math&gt; and
* &lt;math&gt;\widetilde{c}_i \in \sum_{j\leq i} \mathcal{Z}^- t_j \text{ and } \widetilde{c}_i \equiv t_i \mod v^{-1}F^-&lt;/math&gt;
for all &lt;math&gt;i\in I&lt;/math&gt;. The naming "at &lt;math&gt;v=\infty&lt;/math&gt;" alludes to the fact &lt;math&gt;\lim_{v\to\infty} v^{-1} =0&lt;/math&gt; and hence the "specialization" &lt;math&gt;v\mapsto\infty&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to quotienting out the relation &lt;math&gt;v^{-1}=0&lt;/math&gt;.

One can show that there exists at most one canonical basis at ''v''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 (and at most one at &lt;math&gt;v=\infty&lt;/math&gt;) for each precanonical structure. A sufficient condition for existence is that the polynomials &lt;math&gt;r_{ij}\in\mathcal{Z}&lt;/math&gt; defined by &lt;math&gt;\overline{t_j}=\sum_i r_{ij} t_i&lt;/math&gt; satisfy &lt;math&gt;r_{ii}=1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r_{ij}\neq 0 \implies i\leq j&lt;/math&gt;.

A canonical basis at ''v''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 (&lt;math&gt;v=\infty&lt;/math&gt;) induces an isomorphism from &lt;math&gt;\textstyle F^+\cap \overline{F^+} = \sum_i \mathbb{Z}c_i&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;F^+/vF^+&lt;/math&gt;  (&lt;math&gt;\textstyle F^{-} \cap \overline{F^{-}}=\sum_i \mathbb{Z}\widetilde{c}_i \to F^{-}/v^{-1} F^{-}&lt;/math&gt; respectively).

=== Examples ===

==== Quantum groups ====
The canonical basis of quantum groups in the sense of Lusztig and Kashiwara are canonical basis at &lt;math&gt;v=0&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Hecke algebras ====
Let &lt;math&gt;(W,S)&lt;/math&gt; be a [[Coxeter group]]. The corresponding [[Iwahori-Hecke algebra]] &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; has the standard basis &lt;math&gt;(T_w)_{w\in W}&lt;/math&gt;, the group is partially ordered by the [[Bruhat order]] which is interval finite and has a dualization operation defined by &lt;math&gt;\overline{T_w}:=T_{w^{-1}}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. This is a precanonical structure on &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; that satisfies the sufficient condition above and the corresponding canonical basis of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;v=0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Kazhdan–Lusztig basis]]

: &lt;math&gt;C_w' = \sum_{y\leq w} P_{y,w}(v^2) T_w&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;P_{y,w}&lt;/math&gt; being the [[Kazhdan–Lusztig polynomial]]s.

==Linear algebra==
If we are given an ''n'' × ''n'' [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and wish to find a matrix &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; in [[Jordan normal form]], [[matrix similarity|similar]] to &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, we are interested only in sets of [[linearly independent]] generalized eigenvectors.  A matrix in Jordan normal form is an "almost diagonal matrix," that is, as close to diagonal as possible.  A [[diagonal matrix]] &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is a special case of a matrix in Jordan normal form.  An [[eigenvector|ordinary eigenvector]] is a special case of a generalized eigenvector.

Every ''n'' × ''n'' matrix &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; possesses ''n'' linearly independent generalized eigenvectors.  Generalized eigenvectors corresponding to distinct [[eigenvalues]] are linearly independent.  If &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is an eigenvalue of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of [[algebraic multiplicity]] &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; will have &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; linearly independent generalized eigenvectors corresponding to &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;.

For any given ''n'' × ''n'' matrix &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, there are infinitely many ways to pick the ''n'' linearly independent generalized eigenvectors.  If they are chosen in a particularly judicious manner, we can use these vectors to show that &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is similar to a matrix in Jordan normal form.  In particular,

'''Definition:'''  A set of ''n'' linearly independent generalized eigenvectors is a '''canonical basis''' if it is composed entirely of Jordan chains.

Thus, once we have determined that a generalized eigenvector of [[generalized eigenvector#Overview and definition|rank]] ''m'' is in a canonical basis, it follows that the ''m'' − 1 vectors &lt;math&gt; \mathbf x_{m-1}, \mathbf x_{m-2}, \ldots , \mathbf x_1 &lt;/math&gt; that are in the Jordan chain generated by &lt;math&gt; \mathbf x_m &lt;/math&gt; are also in the canonical basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bronson|1970|pp=196,197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computation===
Let &lt;math&gt; \lambda_i &lt;/math&gt; be an eigenvalue of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of algebraic multiplicity &lt;math&gt; \mu_i &lt;/math&gt;.  First, find the [[rank (linear algebra)|ranks]] (matrix ranks) of the matrices &lt;math&gt; (A - \lambda_i I), (A - \lambda_i I)^2, \ldots , (A - \lambda_i I)^{m_i} &lt;/math&gt;.  The integer &lt;math&gt;m_i&lt;/math&gt; is determined to be the ''first integer'' for which &lt;math&gt; (A - \lambda_i I)^{m_i} &lt;/math&gt; has rank &lt;math&gt;n - \mu_i &lt;/math&gt; (''n'' being the number of rows or columns of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, that is, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is ''n'' × ''n'').

Now define

:&lt;math&gt; \rho_k = \operatorname{rank}(A - \lambda_i I)^{k-1} - \operatorname{rank}(A - \lambda_i I)^k \qquad (k = 1, 2, \ldots , m_i).&lt;/math&gt;

The variable &lt;math&gt; \rho_k &lt;/math&gt; designates the number of linearly independent generalized eigenvectors of rank ''k'' (generalized eigenvector rank; see [[generalized eigenvector#Overview and definition|generalized eigenvector]]) corresponding to the eigenvalue &lt;math&gt; \lambda_i &lt;/math&gt; that will appear in a canonical basis for &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.  Note that

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{rank}(A - \lambda_i I)^0 = \operatorname{rank}(I) = n .&lt;/math&gt;

Once we have determined the number of generalized eigenvectors of each rank that a canonical basis has, we can obtain the vectors explicitly (see [[Generalized eigenvector#Computation of generalized eigenvectors|generalized eigenvector]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bronson|1970|pp=197,198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Example===
This example illustrates a canonical basis with two Jordan chains.  Unfortunately, it is a little difficult to construct an interesting example of low order.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Nering|1970|pp=122,123}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The matrix

:&lt;math&gt;A = \begin{pmatrix} 
4 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 \\
0 &amp; 4 &amp; 2 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 4 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 5 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 5 &amp; 2 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 4
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

has eigenvalues &lt;math&gt; \lambda_1 = 4 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \lambda_2 = 5 &lt;/math&gt; with algebraic multiplicities &lt;math&gt; \mu_1 = 4 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \mu_2 = 2 &lt;/math&gt;, but [[geometric multiplicity|geometric multiplicities]] &lt;math&gt; \gamma_1 = 1 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \gamma_2 = 1 &lt;/math&gt;.

For &lt;math&gt; \lambda_1 = 4,&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt; n - \mu_1 = 6 - 4 = 2, &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; (A - 4I) &lt;/math&gt; has rank 5,
:&lt;math&gt; (A - 4I)^2 &lt;/math&gt; has rank 4,
:&lt;math&gt; (A - 4I)^3 &lt;/math&gt; has rank 3,
:&lt;math&gt; (A - 4I)^4 &lt;/math&gt; has rank 2.

Therefore &lt;math&gt;m_1 = 4.&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \rho_4 = \operatorname{rank}(A - 4I)^3 - \operatorname{rank}(A - 4I)^4 = 3 - 2 = 1,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \rho_3 = \operatorname{rank}(A - 4I)^2 - \operatorname{rank}(A - 4I)^3 = 4 - 3 = 1,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \rho_2 = \operatorname{rank}(A - 4I)^1 - \operatorname{rank}(A - 4I)^2 = 5 - 4 = 1,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \rho_1 = \operatorname{rank}(A - 4I)^0 - \operatorname{rank}(A - 4I)^1 = 6 - 5 = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, a canonical basis for &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; will have, corresponding to &lt;math&gt; \lambda_1 = 4,&lt;/math&gt; one generalized eigenvector each of ranks 4, 3, 2 and 1.

For &lt;math&gt; \lambda_2 = 5,&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt; n - \mu_2 = 6 - 2 = 4, &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; (A - 5I) &lt;/math&gt; has rank 5,
:&lt;math&gt; (A - 5I)^2 &lt;/math&gt; has rank 4.

Therefore &lt;math&gt;m_2 = 2.&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \rho_2 = \operatorname{rank}(A - 5I)^1 - \operatorname{rank}(A - 5I)^2 = 5 - 4 = 1,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \rho_1 = \operatorname{rank}(A - 5I)^0 - \operatorname{rank}(A - 5I)^1 = 6 - 5 = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, a canonical basis for &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; will have, corresponding to &lt;math&gt; \lambda_2 = 5,&lt;/math&gt; one generalized eigenvector each of ranks 2 and 1.

A canonical basis for &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;
\left\{ \mathbf x_1, \mathbf x_2, \mathbf x_3, \mathbf x_4, \mathbf y_1, \mathbf y_2 \right\} =
\left\{
\begin{pmatrix} -4 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix} -27 \\ -4 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix} 25 \\ -25 \\ -2 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 36 \\ -12 \\ -2 \\ 2 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ -4 \\ -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} 
\right\}.
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \mathbf x_1 &lt;/math&gt; is the ordinary eigenvector associated with &lt;math&gt; \lambda_1 &lt;/math&gt;.  
&lt;math&gt; \mathbf x_2, \mathbf x_3 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \mathbf x_4 &lt;/math&gt; are generalized eigenvectors associated with &lt;math&gt; \lambda_1 &lt;/math&gt;.  
&lt;math&gt; \mathbf y_1 &lt;/math&gt; is the ordinary eigenvector associated with &lt;math&gt; \lambda_2 &lt;/math&gt;.  
&lt;math&gt; \mathbf y_2 &lt;/math&gt; is a generalized eigenvector associated with &lt;math&gt; \lambda_2 &lt;/math&gt;.

A matrix &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; in Jordan normal form, similar to &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is obtained as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;
M =
\begin{pmatrix} \mathbf x_1 &amp; \mathbf x_2 &amp; \mathbf x_3 &amp; \mathbf x_4 &amp; \mathbf y_1 &amp; \mathbf y_2 \end{pmatrix} =
\begin{pmatrix}
-4 &amp; -27 &amp;  25 &amp;   0 &amp; 3 &amp; -8 \\
 0 &amp;  -4 &amp; -25 &amp;  36 &amp; 2 &amp; -4 \\
 0 &amp;   0 &amp;  -2 &amp; -12 &amp; 1 &amp; -1 \\
 0 &amp;   0 &amp;   0 &amp;  -2 &amp; 1 &amp;  0 \\
 0 &amp;   0 &amp;   0 &amp;   2 &amp; 0 &amp;  1 \\
 0 &amp;   0 &amp;   0 &amp;  -1 &amp; 0 &amp;  0
\end{pmatrix},
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; J = \begin{pmatrix}
4 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 4 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 4 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 4 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 5 &amp; 1 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 5
\end{pmatrix},
&lt;/math&gt;

where the matrix &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a [[generalized modal matrix]] for &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;AM = MJ&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bronson|1970|p=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[gravitation]], '''Chasles' theorem''' says that the Newtonian gravitational attraction of a spherical shell, outside of that shell, is equivalent mathematically to the attraction of a point mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink= Benjamin Peirce|author = Peirce, Benjamin|title = A System of Analytic Mechanics|year=1855|url=http://www.math.harvard.edu/history/peirce_mechanics/0104.html|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theorem is attributed to [[Michel Chasles]] (1793–1880).

Benjamin Peirce followed Chasles work on that developed an analogy between conduction of heat and gravitational attraction:
:A single current in a direction perpendicular to the level surfaces, and having a velocity proportionate to the decrease in density … is the law of propagation of heat, when there is no radiation, and hence arise the analogies between the levels and isothermal surfaces, and the identity of the mathematical investigations of the attraction of bodies and the propagation of heat which have been developed by Chasles.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce section 142 (end)&lt;/ref&gt;
'''Chaslesian shell''' is the figure that Peirce exploits:&lt;ref&gt;Section 143&lt;/ref&gt;
:If an infinitely thin homogeneous shell is formed upon each level surface, of a system of bodies, having at each point a thickness proportional to the attraction at that point, the portion of either of these shells, which is included in a canal formed by trajectories, bears the same ratio to the whole shell, which the portion of another shell included in the same canal bears to that shell, provided there is no mass included between the shells.
:The conception of these shells, and the investigation of their acting and reacting properties was original with Chasles, and it will be convenient, as it is appropriate, to designated them as Chaslesian shells.
The Chasles theorem as expressed by Peirce:&lt;ref&gt;Section 145 (end)&lt;/ref&gt;
:The external level surfaces of a shell are the same with those of the original masses, and the attraction of the shell upon an external point has the same direction with the attraction of the original masses, and is normal to the level surface passing through the point. This theorem is due to Chasles.
The [[ellipsoid]] is recruited to bound the Chaslesian shells:&lt;ref&gt;Section 143&lt;/ref&gt;
:An infinitely thin homogeneous shell, of which the inner and outer surfaces are those of similar, and similarly placed, concentric ellipsoids, is a Chaslesian shell.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16938">In the [[philosophy of mathematics]], '''constructivism''' asserts that it is necessary to find (or "construct") a mathematical object to prove that it exists. In standard mathematics, one can prove the [[existence]] of a mathematical object without "finding" that object explicitly, by assuming its non-existence and then deriving a [[contradiction]] from that assumption. This [[proof by contradiction]] is not constructively valid. The constructive viewpoint involves a verificational interpretation of the [[existential quantifier]], which is at odds with its classical interpretation.

There are many forms of constructivism.&lt;ref&gt;Troelstra 1977a:974&lt;/ref&gt; These include the program of [[intuitionism]] founded by [[Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer|Brouwer]], the [[finitism]] of [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]] and [[Paul Bernays|Bernays]], the constructive recursive mathematics of [[Nikolai Aleksandrovich Shanin|Shanin]] and [[Andrey Markov (Soviet mathematician)|Markov]], and [[Errett Bishop|Bishop]]'s program of [[constructive analysis]]. Constructivism also includes the study of [[constructive set theory|constructive set theories]] such as [[CZF]] and the study of [[topos theory]].

Constructivism is often identified with intuitionism, although intuitionism is only one constructivist program. Intuitionism maintains that the foundations of mathematics lie in the individual mathematician's intuition, thereby making mathematics into an intrinsically subjective activity.&lt;ref&gt;Troelstra 1977b:1&lt;/ref&gt; Other forms of constructivism are not based on this viewpoint of intuition, and are compatible with an objective viewpoint on mathematics.

== Constructive mathematics ==
Much constructive mathematics uses [[intuitionistic logic]], which is essentially [[classical logic]] without the [[law of the excluded middle]]. This law states that, for any proposition, either that proposition is true or its negation is. This is not to say that the law of the excluded middle is denied entirely; special cases of the law will be provable. It is just that the general law is not assumed as an [[axiom]]. The [[law of non-contradiction]] (which states that contradictory statements cannot both at the same time be true) is still valid.

For instance, in [[Heyting arithmetic]], one can prove that for any proposition ''p'' that ''does not contain [[Quantifiers (logic)|quantifiers]]'', &lt;math&gt;\forall x,y,z,\ldots \in \mathbb{N} : p \vee \neg p&lt;/math&gt; is a theorem (where ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' ... are the [[free variables]] in the proposition ''p''). In this sense, propositions restricted to the [[finite set|finite]] are still regarded as being either true or false, as they are in classical mathematics, but this [[law of bivalence|bivalence]] does not extend to propositions that refer to [[Infinity|infinite]] collections.

In fact, [[L.E.J. Brouwer]], founder of the intuitionist school, viewed the law of the excluded middle as abstracted from finite experience, and then applied to the infinite without [[theory of justification|justification]]. For instance, [[Goldbach's conjecture]] is the assertion that every even number (greater than 2) is the sum of two [[prime number]]s. It is possible to test for any particular even number whether or not it is the sum of two primes (for instance by exhaustive search), so any one of them is either the sum of two primes or it is not. And so far, every one thus tested has in fact been the sum of two primes.

But there is no known proof that all of them are so, nor any known proof that not all of them are so. Thus to Brouwer, we are not justified in asserting "either Goldbach's conjecture is true, or it is not." And while the conjecture may one day be solved, the argument applies to similar unsolved problems; to Brouwer, the law of the excluded middle was tantamount to assuming that ''every'' mathematical problem has a solution.

With the omission of the law of the excluded middle as an axiom, the remaining [[logical system]] has an [[existence property]] that classical logic does not have: whenever &lt;math&gt;\exists_{x\in X} P(x)&lt;/math&gt; is proven constructively, then in fact &lt;math&gt;P(a)&lt;/math&gt; is proven constructively for (at least) one particular &lt;math&gt;a\in X&lt;/math&gt;, often called a witness. Thus the proof of the existence of a mathematical object is tied to the possibility of its construction.

=== Example from real analysis&lt;!--Linked from 'Construction of the real numbers'--&gt; ===
In classical [[real analysis]], one way to [[construction of the real numbers|define a real number]] is as an [[equivalence class]] of [[Cauchy sequence]]s of [[rational number]]s.

In constructive mathematics, one way to construct a real number is as a [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''ƒ'' that takes a positive integer &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and outputs a rational ''ƒ''(''n''), together with a function ''g'' that takes a positive integer ''n'' and outputs a positive integer ''g''(''n'') such that

:&lt;math&gt;\forall n\ \forall i,j \ge g(n)\quad |f(i) - f(j)| \le {1 \over n}&lt;/math&gt;

so that as ''n'' increases, the values of ''ƒ''(''n'') get closer and closer together. We can use ''ƒ'' and ''g'' together to compute as close a rational approximation as we like to the real number they represent.

Under this definition, a simple representation of the real number [[Euler's number|''e'']] is:

:&lt;math&gt;f(n) = \sum_{i=0}^n {1 \over i!}, \quad g(n) = n.&lt;/math&gt;

This definition corresponds to the classical definition using Cauchy sequences, except with a constructive twist: for a classical Cauchy sequence, it is required that, for any given distance, [[existential quantification|there exists (in a classical sense)]] a member in the sequence after which all members are closer together than that distance. In the constructive version, it is required that, for any given distance, it is possible to actually specify a point in the sequence where this happens (this required specification is often called the [[modulus of convergence]]). In fact, the [[BHK interpretation|standard constructive interpretation]] of the mathematical statement

:&lt;math&gt;\forall n : \exists m : \forall i,j \ge m: |f(i) - f(j)| \le {1 \over n}&lt;/math&gt;

is precisely the existence of the function computing the modulus of convergence. Thus the difference between the two definitions of real numbers can be thought of as the difference in the interpretation of the statement "for all... there exists..."

This then opens the question as to what sort of [[function (mathematics)|function]] from a [[countable]] [[Set (mathematics)|set]] to a countable set, such as ''f'' and ''g'' above, can actually be constructed. Different versions of constructivism diverge on this point. Constructions can be defined as broadly as [[free choice sequences]], which is the intuitionistic view, or as narrowly as algorithms (or more technically, the [[computable function]]s), or even left unspecified. If, for instance, the algorithmic view is taken, then the reals as constructed here are essentially what classically would be called the [[computable number]]s.

=== Cardinality ===
To take the algorithmic interpretation above would seem at odds with classical notions of [[cardinal number|cardinality]]. By enumerating algorithms, we can show classically that the computable numbers are countable. And yet [[Cantor's diagonal argument]] shows that real numbers have higher cardinality. Furthermore, the diagonal argument seems perfectly constructive. To identify the real numbers with the computable numbers would then be a contradiction.

And in fact, Cantor's diagonal argument ''is'' constructive, in the sense that given a [[bijection]] between the real numbers and natural numbers, one constructs a real number that doesn't fit, and thereby proves a contradiction. We can indeed enumerate algorithms to construct a function ''T'', about which we initially assume that it is a function from the natural numbers [[onto]] the reals. But, to each algorithm, there may or may not correspond a real number, as the algorithm may fail to satisfy the constraints, or even be non-terminating (''T'' is a [[partial function]]), so this fails to produce the required bijection. In short, one who takes the view that real numbers are (individually) effectively computable interprets Cantor's result as showing that the real numbers (collectively) are not [[recursively enumerable]].

Still, one might expect that since ''T'' is a partial function from the natural numbers onto the real numbers, that therefore the real numbers are ''no more than'' countable. And, since every natural number can be [[Trivial (mathematics)|trivially]] represented as a real number, therefore the real numbers are ''no less than'' countable. They are, therefore ''exactly'' countable. However this reasoning is not constructive, as it still does not construct the required bijection. The classical theorem proving the existence of a bijection in such circumstances, namely the [[Cantor–Bernstein–Schroeder theorem]], is non-constructive and no constructive proof of it is known.

=== Axiom of choice ===
The status of the [[axiom of choice]] in constructive mathematics is complicated by the different approaches of different constructivist programs. One trivial meaning of "constructive", used informally by mathematicians, is "provable in [[ZF set theory]] without the axiom of choice." However, proponents of more limited forms of constructive mathematics would assert that ZF itself is not a constructive system.

In intuitionistic theories of [[type theory]] (especially higher-type arithmetic), many forms of the axiom of choice are permitted. For example, the axiom AC&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; can be paraphrased to say that for any relation ''R'' on the set of real numbers, if you have proved that for each real number ''x'' there is a real number ''y'' such that ''R''(''x'',''y'') holds, then there is actually a function ''F'' such that ''R''(''x'',''F''(''x'')) holds for all real numbers. Similar choice principles are accepted for all finite types. The motivation for accepting these seemingly nonconstructive principles is the intuitionistic understanding of the proof that "for each real number ''x'' there is a real number ''y'' such that ''R''(''x'',''y'') holds". According to the [[BHK interpretation]], this proof itself is essentially the function ''F'' that is desired. The choice principles that intuitionists accept do not imply the [[law of the excluded middle]].

However, in certain axiom systems for constructive set theory, the axiom of choice does imply the law of the excluded middle (in the presence of other axioms), as shown by the [[Diaconescu-Goodman-Myhill theorem]]. Some constructive set theories include weaker forms of the axiom of choice, such as the [[axiom of dependent choice]] in Myhill's set theory.

=== Measure theory ===

Classical [[measure theory]] is fundamentally non-constructive, since the classical definition of [[Lebesgue measure]] does not describe any way to compute the measure of a set or the integral of a function. In fact, if one thinks of a function just as a rule that "inputs a real number and outputs a real number" then there cannot be any algorithm to compute the integral of a function, since any algorithm would only be able to call finitely many values of the function at a time, and finitely many values are not enough to compute the integral to any nontrivial accuracy. The solution to this conundrum, carried out first in Bishop's 1967 book, is to consider only functions that are written as the pointwise limit of continuous functions (with known modulus of continuity), with information about the rate of convergence. An advantage of constructivizing measure theory is that if one can prove that a set is constructively of full measure, then there is an algorithm for finding a point in that set (again see Bishop's book). For example, this approach can be used to construct a real number that is [[Normal number|normal]] to every base.

== The place of constructivism in mathematics ==
Traditionally, some mathematicians have been suspicious, if not antagonistic, towards mathematical constructivism, largely because of limitations they believed it to pose for constructive analysis.
These views were forcefully expressed by [[David Hilbert]] in 1928, when he wrote in &lt;cite&gt;''[[Grundlagen der Mathematik]]''&lt;/cite&gt;, "Taking the principle of excluded middle from the mathematician would be the same, say, as proscribing the telescope to the astronomer or to the boxer the use of his fists".&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]: [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mathematics-constructive/ Constructive Mathematics].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Errett Bishop]], in his 1967 work &lt;cite&gt;''Foundations of Constructive Analysis''&lt;/cite&gt;, worked to dispel these fears by developing a great deal of traditional analysis in a constructive framework.

Even though most mathematicians do not accept the constructivist's thesis that only mathematics done based on constructive methods is sound, constructive methods are increasingly of interest on non-ideological grounds. For example, constructive proofs in analysis may ensure [[witness extraction]], in such a way that working within the constraints of the constructive methods may make finding witnesses to theories easier than using classical methods. Applications for constructive mathematics have also been found in [[typed lambda calculus|typed lambda calculi]], [[History of topos theory|topos theory]] and [[categorical logic]], which are notable subjects in foundational mathematics and [[computer science]]. In algebra, for such entities as [[topos]]es and [[Hopf algebra]]s, the structure supports an [[internal language]] that is a constructive theory; working within the constraints of that language is often more intuitive and flexible than working externally by such means as reasoning about the set of possible concrete algebras and their [[homomorphism]]s.

Physicist [[Lee Smolin]] writes in ''[[Three Roads to Quantum Gravity]]'' that topos theory is "the right form of logic for cosmology" (page 30) and "In its first forms it was called 'intuitionistic logic'" (page 31). "In this kind of logic, the statements an observer can make about the universe are divided into at least three groups: those that we can judge to be true, those that we can judge to be false and those whose truth we cannot decide upon at the present time" (page 28).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2834">In [[real analysis]], a branch of mathematics, '''Cousin's theorem''' states that:

:If for every point of a closed region (in modern terms, "[[closed set|closed]] and [[bounded (set theory)|bounded]]") there is a circle of finite radius (in modern term, a "[[neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighborhood]]"), then the region can be divided into a finite number of subregions such that each subregion is interior to a circle of a given set having its center in the subregion.&lt;ref name="h1"&gt;Hildebrandt 1925, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

This result was proved and established by Pierre Cousin, a student of [[Henri Poincaré]], in 1895, and it is an extension of the original [[Heine–Borel theorem]] on [[compactness]] for arbitrary [[set cover|covers]] of any [[compact space|compact]] subsets of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;. However, Pierre Cousin did not receive any credit. '''Cousin's theorem''' was generally attributed to [[Henri Lebesgue]] and renamed as '''Borel–Lebesgue theorem''', who was aware of this result in 1898 and proved this in his dissertation in 1903.&lt;ref name="h1"/&gt;

Nowadays, it is stated as:
:Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; be a full cover of [''a'', ''b''], that is, a collection of closed subintervals of [''a'', ''b''] with the property that for every ''x''∈[''a'', ''b''], there exists a ''δ''&gt;0 so that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; contains all subintervals of [''a'', ''b''] which contains ''x'' and length smaller than ''δ''. Then there exists a partition {''I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'',...,''I&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''} of non-overlapping intervals for [''a'', ''b''], where ''I&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''=[''x&lt;sub&gt;i-1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'']∈&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; and ''a=x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;...&lt; x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;=b'' for all ''1≤i≤n''.

Further, '''Cousin's theorem''' is mainly only used in [[Henstock–Kurzweil integral]] and is often called '''Fineness Theorem''' or Cousin's lemma. It can be stated as:
:If ''I'' := [''a'', ''b''] ⊆ '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is a [[degeneracy (mathematics)|nondegenerate]] [[compact space|compact]] interval and ''δ'' is any gauge defined on ''I'', then there always exists a tagged partition of ''I'' that is ''δ''-fine.&lt;ref name="b1"&gt;Bartle 2001, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1115">In [[many-valued logic]] with [[linear order|linearly ordered]] [[truth value]]s, '''cyclic negation''' is a unary truth function that takes a truth value ''n'' and returns ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 as value if ''n'' is not the lowest value; otherwise it returns the highest value.

For example, let the set of truth values be {0,1,2}, let ~ denote negation, and let ''p'' be a variable ranging over truth values. For these choices, if p&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 then ~p&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2; and if p&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 then ~p&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.

Cyclic negation was originally introduced by the logician and mathematician [[Emil Leon Post|Emil Post]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15665">In cryptography, the '''dining cryptographers problem''' studies how to perform a [[secure multi-party computation]] of the boolean-OR function. [[David Chaum]] first proposed this problem in the early 1980s and used it as an illustrative example to show that it was possible to send anonymous messages with unconditional sender and recipient untraceability. Anonymous communication networks based on this problem are often referred to as '''DC-nets''' (where DC stands for "dining cryptographers").

Despite the word ''dining'', the dining cryptographers problem is unrelated to the [[dining philosophers problem]].

== Description ==
[[File:Dining Cryptographers.svg|thumb|Dining cryptographers problem illustration|300px|right]]
Three cryptographers gather around a table for dinner.  The waiter informs them that the meal has been paid for by someone, who could be one of the cryptographers or the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA).  The cryptographers respect each other's right to make an anonymous payment, but want to find out whether the NSA paid. So they decide to execute a two-stage protocol.

In the first stage, every two cryptographers establish a shared one-bit secret, say by tossing a coin behind a menu so that only two cryptographers see the outcome in turn for each two cryptographers. Suppose, for example, that after the coin tossing, cryptographer A and B share a secret bit &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, A and C share &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, and B and C share &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;.

In the second stage, each cryptographer publicly announces a bit, which is:
* if they didn't pay for the meal, the [[exclusive OR]] (XOR) of the two shared bits they hold with their two neighbours,
* if they did pay for the meal, the opposite of that XOR.

Supposing none of the cryptographers paid, then A announces &lt;math&gt;1 \oplus 0 = 1&lt;/math&gt;, B announces &lt;math&gt;1 \oplus 1 = 0&lt;/math&gt;, and C announces &lt;math&gt;0 \oplus 1 = 1&lt;/math&gt;. On the other hand, if A paid, she announces &lt;math&gt;\lnot (1 \oplus 0) = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

The three public announcements combined reveal the answer to their question. One simply computes the XOR of the three bits announced. If the result is 0, it implies that none of the cryptographers paid (so the NSA must have paid the bill). Otherwise, one of the cryptographers paid, but their identity remains unknown to the other cryptographers.

David Chaum coined the term ''dining cryptographers network'', or DC-net, for this protocol.

==Limitations==
The DC-net protocol is simple and elegant. It has several limitations, however, some solutions to which have been explored in follow-up research (see the References section below).

; Collision : If two cryptographers paid for the dinner, their messages will cancel each other out, and the final XOR result will be &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.  This is called a collision and allows only one participant to transmit at a time using this protocol. In a more general case, a collision happens as long as any even number of participants send messages.

; Disruption : Any malicious cryptographer who does not want the group to communicate successfully can jam the protocol so that the final XOR result is useless, simply by sending random bits instead of the correct result of the XOR. This problem occurs because the original protocol was designed without using any [[public key]] technology and lacks reliable mechanisms to check whether participants honestly follow the protocol.&lt;ref&gt;[[Knights and Knaves]].&lt;/ref&gt;

; Complexity : The protocol requires pairwise shared secret keys between the participants, which may be problematic if there are many participants. Also, though the DC-net protocol is "unconditionally secure", it actually depends on the assumption that "unconditionally secure" channels already exist between pairs of the participants, which is not easy to achieve in practice.

A related [[anonymous veto network]] algorithm computes the logical OR of several users' inputs, rather than a logical XOR as in DC-nets, which may be useful in applications to which a logical OR combining operation is naturally suited.

==History==
[[David Chaum]] first thought about this problem in the early 1980s. The first publication that outlines the basic underlying ideas is his.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=David Chaum | title=Security without identification: transaction systems to make big brother obsolete | journal=Communications of the ACM | volume=28 | issue=10 | year=1985 | pages=1030–1044 | doi=10.1145/4372.4373 | url=http://www.cs.ru.nl/~jhh/pub/secsem/chaum1985bigbrother.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The journal version appeared in the very first issue of the Journal of Cryptology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=David Chaum | title=The Dining Cryptographers Problem: Unconditional Sender and Recipient Untraceability | journal=Journal of Cryptology | volume=1 | issue=1 | year=1988 | pages=65–75 | doi=10.1007/BF00206326 | url=http://www.cs.cornell.edu/People/egs/herbivore/dcnets.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generalizations==

DC-nets are readily generalized to allow for transmissions of more than one bit per round, for groups larger than three participants, and for arbitrary "alphabets" other than the binary digits 0 and 1, as described below.

=== Transmissions of longer messages ===

To enable an anonymous sender to transmit more than one bit of information per DC-nets round, the group of cryptographers can simply repeat the protocol as many times as desired to create a desired number of bits worth of transmission bandwidth.  These repetitions need not be performed serially.  In practical DC-net systems, it is typical for pairs of participants to agree up-front on a single shared "master" secret, using [[Diffie–Hellman key exchange]] for example.  Each participant then locally feeds this shared master secret into a [[pseudorandom number generator]], in order to produce as many shared "coin flips" as desired to allow an anonymous sender to transmit multiple bits of information.

=== Larger group sizes ===

The protocol can be generalized to a group of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; participants, each with a shared secret key in common with each other participant.  In each round of the protocol, if a participant wants to transmit an untraceable message to the group, they invert their publicly announced bit.  The participants can be visualized as a [[Complete graph|fully connected graph]] with the vertices representing the participants and the edges representing their shared secret keys.

=== Sparse secret sharing graphs ===

The protocol may be run with less than fully connected secret sharing graphs, which can improve the performance and scalability of practical DC-net implementations, at the potential risk of reducing anonymity if colluding participants can split the secret sharing graph into separate connected components.  For example, an intuitively appealing but less secure generalization to &lt;math&gt;n &gt; 3&lt;/math&gt; participants using a [[ring topology]], where each cryptographer sitting around a table shares a secret ''only'' with the cryptographer to their immediate left and right, and ''not'' with every other cryptographer.  Such a topology is appealing because each cryptographer needs to coordinate two coin flips per round, rather than &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.  However, if Adam and Charlie are actually NSA agents sitting immediately to the left and right of Bob, an innocent victim, and if Adam and Charlie secretly collude to reveal their secrets to each other, then they can determine with certainty whether or not Bob was the sender of a 1 bit in a DC-net run, regardless of how many participants there are in total.  This is because the colluding participants Adam and Charlie effectively "split" the secret sharing graph into two separate disconnected components, one containing only Bob, the other containing all other honest participants.

Another compromise secret sharing DC-net topology, employed in the [http://dedis.cs.yale.edu/2010/anon/ Dissent] system for scalability,&lt;ref name="WCFJ12"&gt;{{cite conference |author1=David Isaac Wolinsky |author2=Henry Corrigan-Gibbs |author3=Bryan Ford |author4=Aaron Johnson | title= Dissent in Numbers: Making Strong Anonymity Scale | conference=10th USENIX Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation (OSDI) | location=Hollywood, CA, USA | date=October 8–10, 2012 | url=http://dedis.cs.yale.edu/2010/anon/papers/osdi12-abs}}&lt;/ref&gt; may be described as a ''client/server'' or ''user/trustee'' topology.  In this variant, we assume there are two types of participants playing different roles: a potentially large number ''n'' of users who desire anonymity, and a much smaller number &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; of ''trustees'' whose role is to help the users obtain that anonymity.  In this topology, each of the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; users shares a secret with each of the &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; trustees—but users share no secrets directly with other users, and trustees share no secrets directly with other trustees—resulting in an &lt;math&gt;n \times m&lt;/math&gt; secret sharing matrix.  If the number of trustees &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is small, then each user needs to manage only a few shared secrets, improving efficiency for users in the same way the ring topology does.  However, as long as ''at least one trustee'' behaves honestly and does not leak his or her secrets or collude with other participants, then that honest trustee forms a "hub" connecting all honest users into a single fully connected component, regardless of which or how many other users and/or trustees might be dishonestly colluding.  Users need not know or guess which trustee is honest; their security depends only on the ''existence'' of at least one honest, non-colluding trustee.

=== Alternate alphabets and combining operators ===

Though the simple DC-nets protocol uses [[Bit|binary digits]] as its transmission alphabet, and uses the XOR operator to combine cipher texts, the basic protocol generalizes to any alphabet and combining operator suitable for [[one-time pad]] encryption.  This flexibility arises naturally from the fact that the secrets shared between the many pairs of participants are, in effect, merely one-time pads combined together symmetrically within a single DC-net round.

One useful alternate choice of DC-nets alphabet and combining operator is to use a [[finite group]] suitable for public-key cryptography as the alphabet—such as a [[Schnorr group]] or [[elliptic curve]]—and to use the associated group operator as the DC-net combining operator.  Such a choice of alphabet and operator makes it possible for clients to use [[zero-knowledge proof]] techniques to prove correctness properties about the DC-net ciphertexts that they produce, such as that the participant is not "jamming" the transmission channel, without compromising the anonymity offered by the DC-net.  This technique was first suggested by Golle and Juels,&lt;ref name="GJ04"&gt;{{cite conference |author1=Philippe Golle |author2=Ari Juels | title=Dining Cryptographers Revisited | conference=Eurocrypt 2004 | date=May 2–6, 2004 | location=Interlaken, Switzerland | url=http://china.rsa.com/rsalabs/staff/bios/ajuels/publications/pdfs/dc-revisited.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; further developed by Franck,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |degree=M.Sc. |first=Christian |last=Franck |title=New Directions for Dining Cryptographers |year=2008 | url=http://secan-lab.uni.lu/images/stories/christian_franck/FRANCK_Christian_Master_Thesis.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later implemented in [http://dedis.cs.yale.edu/2010/anon/papers/verdict-abs Verdict], a cryptographically verifiable implementation of the [http://dedis.cs.yale.edu/2010/anon/ Dissent] system.&lt;ref name="CWF13"&gt;{{cite conference |author1=Henry Corrigan-Gibbs |author2=David Isaac Wolinsky |author3=Bryan Ford | title= Proactively Accountable Anonymous Messaging in Verdict | conference=22nd USENIX Security Symposium | date=August 14–16, 2013 | location=Washington, DC, USA | url=http://dedis.cs.yale.edu/2010/anon/papers/verdict-abs }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Handling or avoiding collisions ==

The measure originally suggested by David Chaum to avoid collisions is to retransmit the message once a collision is detected, but the paper does not explain exactly how to arrange the retransmission.

[http://dedis.cs.yale.edu/2010/anon/ Dissent] avoids the possibility of unintentional collisions by using a verifiable shuffle to establish a DC-nets transmission schedule, such that each participant knows exactly which bits in the schedule correspond to his own transmission slot, but does not know who owns other transmission slots.&lt;ref name="CF10"&gt;{{cite conference |author1=Henry Corrigan-Gibbs |author2=Bryan Ford | title=Dissent: Accountable Group Anonymity | conference=17th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS) | date=October 2010 | location=Chicago, IL, USA | url=http://dedis.cs.yale.edu/2010/anon/papers/ccs10/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Countering disruption attacks ==

[http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/egs/herbivore/documentation.html Herbivore] divides a large anonymity network into smaller DC-net groups, enabling participants to evade disruption attempts by leaving a disrupted group and joining another group, until the participant finds a group free of disruptors.&lt;ref name="SGRE04"&gt;{{cite conference |author1=Emin Gün Sirer |author2=Sharad Goel |author3=Mark Robson |author4=Doğan Engin | title=Eluding Carnivores: File Sharing with Strong Anonymity | conference=ACM SIGOPS European workshop | date= September 19–22, 2004 | location= Leuven, Belgium | url=http://www.cs.cornell.edu/People/egs/714-spring05/herbivore-esigops.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This evasion approach introduces the risk that an adversary who owns many nodes could ''selectively'' disrupt only groups the adversary has not ''completely'' compromised, thereby "herding" participants toward groups that may be functional precisely because they are completely compromised.&lt;ref name="BDMT07"&gt;{{cite conference |author1=Nikita Borisov |author2=George Danezis |author3=Prateek Mittal |author4=Parisa Tabriz | title=Denial of Service or Denial of Security? How Attacks on Reliability can Compromise Anonymity | conference=ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS) | date=October 2007 | location=Alexandria, VA, USA | url=http://hostmaster.freehaven.net/anonbib/cache/ccs07-doa.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[http://dedis.cs.yale.edu/2010/anon/ Dissent] implements several schemes to counter disruption.  The original protocol&lt;ref name="CF10" /&gt; used a verifiable [[shuffling|cryptographic shuffle]] to form a DC-net transmission schedule and distribute "transmission assignments", allowing the correctness of subsequent DC-nets ciphertexts to be verified with a simple [[cryptographic hash function|cryptographic hash]] check.  This technique required a fresh verifiable before every DC-nets round, however, leading to high latencies.  A later, more efficient scheme allows a series of DC-net rounds to proceed without intervening shuffles in the absence of disruption, but in response to a disruption event uses a shuffle to distribute anonymous ''accusations'' enabling a disruption victim to expose and prove the identity of the perpetrator.&lt;ref name="WCFJ12" /&gt;  Finally, more recent versions support fully verifiable DC-nets - at substantial cost in computation efficiency due to the use of [[public-key cryptography]] in the DC-net - as well as a ''hybrid'' mode that uses efficient XOR-based DC-nets in the normal case and verifiable DC-nets only upon disruption, to distribute accusations more quickly than is feasible using verifiable shuffles.&lt;ref name="CWF13" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
a^{\tfrac{p-1}{2}} \equiv
\begin{cases}
\;\;\,1\pmod{p}&amp; \text{ iff there is an integer }x \text{ such that }a\equiv x^2 \pmod{p}\\

\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

Euler's criterion can be concisely reformulated using the [[Legendre symbol]]:&lt;ref&gt;Hardy &amp; Wright, thm. 83&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\left(\frac{a}{p}\right) \equiv a^{(p-1)/2} \pmod p.
&lt;/math&gt;

The criterion first appeared in a 1748 paper by [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]].&lt;ref&gt;Lemmermeyer, p. 4 cites two papers, E134 and E262 in the Euler Archive&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proof==

The proof uses the fact that the residue classes modulo a prime number are a [[finite field|field]]. See the article [[Characteristic_(algebra)#Case_of_fields|prime field]] for more details.

Because the modulus is prime, [[Lagrange's theorem (number theory)|Lagrange's theorem]] applies: a polynomial of degree {{mvar|k}} can only have at most {{mvar|k}} roots. In particular, &lt;math&gt;x^2 \equiv a \pmod p&lt;/math&gt; has at most 2 roots for each {{mvar|a}}. This immediately implies that besides 0 there are at least {{math|(''p'' - 1)/2}} distinct quadratic residues (mod {{mvar|p}}): each of the {{math|''p'' - 1}} possible {{mvar|x}} can only be accompanied by one other to give the same residue.

As {{mvar|a}} is coprime to {{mvar|p}}, [[Fermat's little theorem]] says that
:&lt;math&gt;
a^{p-1}\equiv 1 \pmod p,
&lt;/math&gt;
which can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;
\left( a^{\tfrac{p-1}{2}}-1 \right)\left( a^{\tfrac{p-1}{2}}+1 \right)    \equiv 0 \pmod p.
&lt;/math&gt;
Since the integers mod {{mvar|p}} form a field, for each {{mvar|a}} one or the other of these factors must be zero.

Now if {{mvar|a}} is a quadratic residue, {{math|''a'' ≡ ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}},
:&lt;math&gt;
a^{\tfrac{p-1}{2}}\equiv {(x^2)}^{\tfrac{p-1}{2}} \equiv x^{p-1}\equiv1\pmod p.
&lt;/math&gt;
So every quadratic residue (mod {{mvar|p}}) makes the first factor zero.

Applying Lagrange's theorem again, we note that there can be no more than {{math|(''p'' - 1)/2}} values of {{mvar|a}} that make the first factor zero. But as we noted at the beginning, there are at least {{math|(''p'' - 1)/2}} distinct quadratic residues (mod {{mvar|p}}) (besides 0). Therefore they are precisely the residue classes that make the first factor zero. The other {{math|(''p'' - 1)/2}} residue classes, the nonresidues, must make the second factor zero, or they would not satisfy Fermat's little theorem. This is Euler's criterion.

==Examples==
'''Example 1: Finding primes for which ''a'' is a residue'''

Let ''a'' = 17. For which primes ''p'' is 17 a quadratic residue?

We can test prime ''p'''s manually given the formula above.

In one case, testing ''p'' = 3, we have 17&lt;sup&gt;(3 − 1)/2&lt;/sup&gt; = 17&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; ≡ 2 ≡ −1 (mod 3), therefore 17 is not a quadratic residue modulo 3.

In another case, testing ''p'' = 13, we have 17&lt;sup&gt;(13 − 1)/2&lt;/sup&gt; = 17&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; ≡ 1 (mod 13), therefore 17 is a quadratic residue modulo 13.  As confirmation, note that 17 ≡ 4 (mod 13), and 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 4.

We can do these calculations faster by using various modular arithmetic and Legendre symbol properties.

If we keep calculating the values, we find:
:(17/''p'') = +1 for ''p'' = {13, 19, ...} (17 is a quadratic residue modulo these values)

:(17/''p'') = −1 for ''p'' = {3, 5, 7, 11, 23, ...} (17 is not a quadratic residue modulo these values).

'''Example 2: Finding residues given a prime modulus ''p'' '''

Which numbers are squares modulo 17 (quadratic residues modulo 17)?

We can manually calculate it as:
: 1&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 1
: 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 4
: 3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 9
: 4&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 16
: 5&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 25 ≡ 8 (mod 17)
: 6&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 36 ≡ 2 (mod 17)
: 7&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 49 ≡ 15 (mod 17)
: 8&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 64 ≡ 13 (mod 17).

So the set of the quadratic residues modulo 17 is {1,2,4,8,9,13,15,16}.  Note that we did not need to calculate squares for the values 9 through 16, as they are all negatives of the previously squared values (e.g. 9 ≡ −8 (mod 17), so 9&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≡ (−8)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 64 ≡ 13 (mod 17)).

We can find quadratic residues or verify them using the above formula.  To test if 2 is a quadratic residue modulo 17, we calculate 2&lt;sup&gt;(17 − 1)/2&lt;/sup&gt; = 2&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; ≡ 1 (mod 17), so it is a quadratic residue.  To test if 3 is a quadratic residue modulo 17, we calculate 3&lt;sup&gt;(17 − 1)/2&lt;/sup&gt; = 3&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; ≡ 16 ≡ −1 (mod 17), so it is not a quadratic residue.

Euler's criterion is related to the [[Quadratic reciprocity|Law of quadratic reciprocity]] and is used in a definition of [[Euler–Jacobi pseudoprime]]s.

[[Image:EuroCalc.jpg|thumb|Simple euro calculator (Germany)]]
A '''euro calculator''' is a very popular type of [[calculator]] in European countries (see [[eurozone]]) that adopted the [[euro]] as their official monetary unit. It functions like any other normal calculator, but it also includes a special function which allows one to convert a value expressed in the previously official unit (the [[Spanish peseta|peseta]] in [[Spain]], for example) to the new value in euros, or vice versa. Its use became very popular within the population and commerce of these countries especially during the first few months after adopting the euro.

As so many were produced, they are also found outside the eurozone to help staff with conversions at airports or railway stations where the euro has a strong presence.

The '''germanium-vacancy center (Ge-V)''' is an optically active [[Crystallographic defects in diamond|defect]] in [[diamond]], which can be created by doping [[germanium]] into diamond during its growth or by implanting germanium [[ion]]s into diamond after its growth. Its properties are similar to those of the [[silicon-vacancy center in diamond]] (SiV). Ge-V can behave as a [[single-photon source]] and shows potential for quantum and nanoscience applications due to its narrow [[Zero-phonon line and phonon sideband|zero-phonon line]] (ZPL) and minimal phononic-sideband (compared to that of the [[nitrogen-vacancy center]] (NV).&lt;ref name=iwasaki2015/&gt;

== Properties ==

Ge-V is predicted to consist of one germanium atom situated between two adjacent lattice vacancies and have the same D&lt;sub&gt;3d&lt;/sub&gt; [[Crystallographic point group|point group]] symmetry as SiV. It has a single ZPL at 602&amp;nbsp;nm (2.059&amp;nbsp;eV) at room-temperature, which splits into two components separated by 0.67&amp;nbsp;meV at low-temperatures (10&amp;nbsp;K). The Ge-V has an excited state lifetime of 1.4–5.5&amp;nbsp;ns.&lt;ref name=iwasaki2015 /&gt;

== Formation ==
Ge-V can be created during the diamond growth, or by [[ion implantation]] and subsequent [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]] at 800&amp;nbsp;°C. The former way results in lower lattice strain, as revealed by the spread in the position and width of the Ge-V ZPL.&lt;ref name=iwasaki2015 /&gt;&lt;ref name=palyanov2015&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/srep14789| pmid = 26435400| pmc = 4593174| title = Germanium: a new catalyst for diamond synthesis and a new optically active impurity in diamond| journal = Scientific Reports| volume = 5| pages = 14789| year = 2015| last1 = Palyanov | first1 = Y.

ILNumerics is an extension to [[Visual Studio Debugger|Visual Studio]] and aims at supporting the creation of technical applications based on .NET.

==History==
ILNumerics started in 2006 as an open source project, originating from the Technical University of Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.entrepreneurship.tu-berlin.de/menue/start-ups_events/gruenderstories_start-ups/steckbriefe/steckbrief_ilnumerics |title=Centre for Entrepreneurship: Steckbrief ILNumerics |publisher=Entrepreneurship.tu-berlin.de |date= |accessdate=2016-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 ILNumerics won the [[BASTA! Innovation Awards 2007]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://basta-award.de BASTA! Innovation Award 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; as most innovative .NET project in [[Germany]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Austria]]. After 6 years of open source development, the project added a closed source, proprietary license in 2011, aiming business and academic developers at the same time. The project quickly gained popularity (download numbers and engagement at stackoverflow.com,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ilnumerics |url=https://www.nuget.org/packages/ILNumerics/ |title=NuGet Gallery &amp;#124; ILNumerics 4.8.0 |publisher=Nuget.org |date= |accessdate=2016-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ilnumerics |title=Newest 'ilnumerics' Questions |publisher=Stack Overflow |date= |accessdate=2016-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/9a67b49d-b0b2-4073-97fd-3f18ba08cc61 |title=ILNumerics Ultimate VS extension |publisher=Visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com |date= |accessdate=2016-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; download counts from website not available).
The [[.NET Framework version history|.NET framework]] was selected as a [[Managed code|managed]] foundation, since earlier attempts on the [[Java Platform|Java platform]] had been abandoned due to technical limitations. Similarly, the .NET framework has not been designed with the focus on requirements of technical application development. ILNumerics added interfaces to popular codes ([[LAPACK]], [[FFTW]]), [[complex number]]s and [[Parametric polymorphism|generic]] [[Array data structure#Multidimensional arrays|mult-dimensional array]] classes. In 2010 graphical capabilities have been added. Efforts to increase the performance of the technology were introduced in 2011. At the same time, a company was founded to continue the development. The technological goal is to establish the .NET framework as a feasible alternative to unmanaged [[Programming language C|languages]] for [[Mathematics and Computing Engineering|numeric computing]].

==Syntax==
ILNumerics implements base functionality frequently needed for application development in technical areas: N-dimensional [[Array data structure|arrays]], [[complex number]]s, [[linear algebra]], [[Fast Fourier transform|FFT]] and [[Chart|plotting]] [[GUI widget|controls]] (2D and [[3D computer graphics|3D]]). The array classes are fully compatible with the array features of [[MATLAB|Matlab]]&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(R)&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt; and [[NumPy|numpy]], including internal storage order, subarray creation, expansion, and advanced indexing. Higher level functionality is provided by toolboxes for [[interpolation]], [[Mathematical optimization|optimization]], [[statistics]], [[Hierarchical Data Format|HDF5]] and [[machine learning]]. The ILNumerics DSL is embedded into .NET. Computational algorithms are formulated using any [[List of CLI languages|CLI language]]. However, only [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] and [[Visual Basic .NET|Visual Basic]] are officially supported. Due to the [[type safety|strong type system]] of the .NET framework algorithms created with ILNumerics are strongly typed. This deviates from the syntax of [[Matlab|alternatives]], which are often weakly typed and therefore easier to adopt.

==Graphics== 
A [[scene graph]] is used in ILNumerics to realize graphical output. Interactive 2D and 3D plots are used in Windows Forms applications. Hardware accelerated drawing is available via [[OpenGL]]. A software renderer is provided for legacy hardware, based on GDI+ and [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]].

==IDE integration==
ILNumerics is distributed as an extension to [[Visual Studio]]. It adds a tool window to the IDE for the graphical inspection of mathematical objects while stepping through user code.

==Performance==
Since ILNumerics comes as a [[Assembly (CLI)|CLI assembly]], it targets [[Common Language Infrastructure]] (CLI) applications. Just like [[Java (programming language)|Java]] - those frameworks are often criticized for not being suitable for numerical computations. Reasons are the [[Random access memory|memory]] management by a [[Garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collector]], the [[Common Intermediate Language|intermediate language]] execution and deficient optimizations by the [[Compiler optimizations|compilers]] involved. ILNumerics approaches these limitations by performing [[loop unrolling]], [[Bounds-checking elimination|removal of bound checks]] on array accesses and [[Cache-oblivious algorithm|cache optimizations]]. Further speed-up is gained by the auto-management of the memory of large array objects. Numerical operations are [[Parallel computing|parallelized]] on [[Multicore programming|multicore]] systems. Linear algebra routines rely on processor specific optimized versions of [[LAPACK]] and [[BLAS]].

ILNumerics arrays utilize the [[Virtual memory|unmanaged heap]] for storing data. This way, the [[Big data|size]] of ILNumerics arrays is not [https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/joshwil/2005/08/10/bigarrayt-getting-around-the-2gb-array-size-limit/ limited by the CLR] and [[P/invoke|interoperability]] with 3rd party libraries is improved.

It is not needed to travel far to register a birth or to obtain an extract of a birth certificate later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icivil.bf/presentation_en.php|title=What is iCivil ?|access-date=2018-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

The system uses wristbands with bubble tags in order to protect the unique ID number given at birth, and an encrypted [[SMS|sms]] to transmit information to [[civil status]] where records are kept. 

According to [[UNICEF]], there are almost 230-million children younger than five years old not registered, who are known as ghost children. Resolving the problem of ghost children is a challenge in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcp.fr/collection/les-enfants-fantomes-un-defi-pour-lafrique/289225|title=Les enfants fantômes, un défi pour l'Afrique|website=LCP Assemblée nationale}}&lt;/ref&gt; iCivil permits help to solve the ghost children problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2016/12/01/africa/birth-registration-system-burkina-faso/index.html|title=This bracelet aims to help 230 million children get birth certificates|last=CNN|first=Sophie Morlin-Yron,|work=CNN|access-date=2018-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The works of [[Andrey Kolmogorov]] and [[Vladimir Arnold]] established that if ''f'' is a multivariate continuous function, then ''f'' can be written as a finite [[Function composition|composition]] of continuous functions of a single variable and the [[binary operation]] of [[addition]].&lt;ref name="h13"&gt;[[Dror Bar-Natan]], ''Dessert: Hilbert's 13th Problem, in Full Colour'' ([http://www.math.toronto.edu/drorbn/Talks/Fields-0911/ link])&lt;/ref&gt;

More specifically 

:&lt;math&gt; f(\mathbf x) = f(x_1,...,x_n) = \sum_{q=0}^{2n} \Phi_{q}\left(\sum_{p=1}^{n} \phi_{q,p}(x_{p})\right) &lt;/math&gt;.

Constructive proofs, and even more specific constructions can be found in &lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Braun and Michael Griebel. "On a constructive proof of Kolmogorov’s superposition theorem", http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.91.5436&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.

In a sense, they showed that the only true multivariate function is the sum, since every other function can be written using [[univariate]] functions and summing.&lt;ref name="dia"&gt;[[Persi Diaconis]] and Mehrdad Shahshahani, ''On Linear Functions of Linear Combinations'' (1984) p. 180 ([http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~cgates/PERSI/papers/nonlin_func.pdf link])&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Kolmogorov–Arnold representation theorem is closely related to [[Hilbert's 13th problem]]. In his [[Paris]] lecture at the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] in 1900, [[David Hilbert]] formulated [[Hilbert's problems|23 problems]] which in his opinion were important for the further development of mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Hilbert]], Mathematical problems, [[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]], '''8''' (1902), pp. 461–462.&lt;/ref&gt; The 13th of these problems dealt with the solution of general equations of higher degrees. It is known that for algebraic equations of degree 4 the solution can be computed by formulae that only contain radicals and arithmetic operations. For higher orders, [[Galois theory]] shows us that the solutions of algebraic equations cannot be expressed in terms of basic algebraic operations. It follows from the so called [[Tschirnhaus transformation]] that the general algebraic equation &lt;math&gt; x^{n}+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\cdot \cdot \cdot +a_{0}=0&lt;/math&gt;  can be translated to the form &lt;math&gt; y^{n}+b_{n-4}y^{n-4}+\cdot \cdot \cdot +b_{1}y+1=0&lt;/math&gt;. The Tschirnhaus transformation is given by a formula containing only radicals and arithmetic operations and transforms. Therefore, the solution of an algebraic equation of degree &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;  can be represented as a superposition of functions of two variables if &lt;math&gt;n&lt;7&lt;/math&gt; and as a superposition of functions of &lt;math&gt;n-4&lt;/math&gt; variables if &lt;math&gt;n\geq 7&lt;/math&gt;. For &lt;math&gt;n=7&lt;/math&gt;  the solution is a superposition of arithmetic operations, radicals, and the solution of the equation  &lt;math&gt;y^{7}+b_{3}y^{3}+b_{2}y^{2}+b_{1}y+1=0&lt;/math&gt;. 

A further simplification with algebraic transformations seems to be impossible which led to Hilbert's conjecture that "A solution of the general equation of degree 7 cannot be represented as a superposition of continuous functions of two variables". This explains the relation of [[Hilbert's thirteenth problem]] to the representation of a higher-dimensional function as superposition of lower-dimensional functions. In this context, it has stimulated many studies in the theory of functions and other related problems by different authors.&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Braun, On Kolmogorov's Superposition Theorem and Its Applications, SVH Verlag, 2010, 192 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variants of the Kolmogorov–Arnold representation theorem==
A variant of Kolmogorov's theorem that reduces the number of
outer functions &lt;math&gt;\Phi _{q}&lt;/math&gt; is due to George Lorentz.&lt;ref&gt;George Lorentz, ''Metric entropy, widths, and superpositions of functions'', The American Mathematical Monthly, 69 (1962), pp. 469–485.&lt;/ref&gt; He showed in 1962  that the outer functions &lt;math&gt;\Phi_{q}&lt;/math&gt; can be replaced by a single function &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;. More precisely, Lorentz proved the existence of functions &lt;math&gt;\phi _{q,p}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;q=0,1,\ldots,2n,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;p=1,\ldots,n,&lt;/math&gt; such that 

:&lt;math&gt; f(\mathbf x) = \sum_{q=0}^{2n} \Phi\left(\sum_{p=1}^{n} \phi_{q,p}(x_{p})\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

Sprecher &lt;ref&gt;David A. Sprecher, ''On the structure of continuous functions of several variables'', [[Transactions of the American Mathematical Society]], '''115''' (1965), pp. 340–355.&lt;/ref&gt; replaced the inner functions &lt;math&gt;\phi_{q,p}&lt;/math&gt; by one single inner function with an appropriate shift in its argument. He proved that there exist real values &lt;math&gt;\eta, \lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_n&lt;/math&gt;, a continuous function &lt;math&gt;\Phi\colon \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, and a real increasing continuous function &lt;math&gt;\phi\colon [0,1] \rightarrow [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\phi \in \operatorname{Lip}(\ln 2/\ln (2N+2))&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;N \geq n \geq 2&lt;/math&gt;, such that

:&lt;math&gt; f(\mathbf x) = \sum_{q=0}^{2n} \Phi\left(\sum_{p=1}^{n} \lambda_p \phi(x_{p}+\eta q)+q \right)&lt;/math&gt;.

Phillip A. Ostrand &lt;ref&gt;Phillip A. Ostrand, ''Dimension of metric spaces and Hilbert's problem 13'', [[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]], 71 (1965), pp. 619–622.&lt;/ref&gt; generalized the Kolmogorov superposition theorem to compact metric spaces. For &lt;math&gt;p=1,...,m&lt;/math&gt; let &lt;math&gt;X_p&lt;/math&gt; be compact metric spaces of finite dimension &lt;math&gt;n_p&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;n = \sum_{p=1}^{m} n_p&lt;/math&gt;. Then there exists continuous functions &lt;math&gt;\phi_{q,p}\colon X_p \rightarrow [0,1], q=0,\ldots,2n, p=1,\ldots,m&lt;/math&gt; and continuous functions &lt;math&gt;G_q\colon [0,1] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}, q=0,\ldots,2n&lt;/math&gt; such that any continuous function &lt;math&gt;f\colon X_1 \times \dots \times X_m \rightarrow \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is representable in the form 

:&lt;math&gt; f(x_1,\ldots,x_m) = \sum_{q=0}^{2n} G_{q}\left(\sum_{p=1}^{m} \phi_{q,p}(x_{p})\right) &lt;/math&gt;.

The '''Short Signal Code''', also known as the '''Short Signal Book''' ({{lang-de|Kurzsignalbuch}}), was a short code system used by the [[Kriegsmarine]] (German Navy) during [[World War II]] to minimize the transmission duration of messages.

==Description==
[[File:Kenngruppenheft.jpg|thumb|right|The short signal booklet was printed with water-soluble red ink on pink [[blotting paper]], in order to be able to destroy it quickly in case of danger.]]
The transmission of radio messages had the potential risks of revealing the submarine's presence and direction; if decoded the content was also revealed. Submarines need to provide information, mostly in standard form (position of convoy to attack and of submarine, weather information), to their bases. Initially Morse code transmissions could be used. To inhibit detection, the duration of messages needed to be minimised; for this, ''Kurzsignale'' short-coding was used. To prevent interception, messages needed to be encrypted by the [[Enigma machine]]. To shorten transmission even further, the message could be sent by a fast machine instead of a human radio operator. For example, the [[Kurier system]] – not implemented in time – decreased the time to send a Morse dot from around 50&amp;nbsp;milliseconds for a human to 1&amp;nbsp;millisecond.

==Short Signal book==
The ''Kurzsignale'' code was intended to shorten transmission time to below the time required to get a directional fix. It was not primarily intended to hide signal contents; protection was intended to be achieved by encoding with the Enigma machine. A copy of the ''Kurzsignale'' code book was captured from {{GS|U-110|1940|6}} on 9 May 1941. In August 1941, Dönitz began addressing U-boats by the names of their commanders, instead of boat numbers. The method of defining U-boat meeting points in the Short Signal Book was regarded as compromised, so a method was defined by [[B-Dienst]] [[cryptanalyst|cryptanalysts]] to disguise their positions on the Kriegsmarine [[German Naval Grid System]] (German:Gradnetzmeldeverfahren) was introduced and used until the end of the war&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Seizing the Enigma – The Race to Break the German U-Boat codes 1939–1943 |date=2012-01-01 |publisher=Naval Institute Press |isbn=978-1-59114-807-4 |location=[[Annapolis]] |page=237 |first=David |last=Kahn |authorlink=David Kahn (writer)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radio direction finding==
Aware of the danger presented by [[radio direction finding]] (RDF), the [[Kriegsmarine]] developed various systems to speed up broadcast. The ''Kurzsignale'' code system condensed messages into short codes consisting of short sequences for common terms such as "convoy location" so that additional descriptions would not be needed in the message. The resulting ''Kurzsignal'' was then encoded with the Enigma machine and subsequently transmitted as rapidly as possible, typically taking about 20 seconds. Typical length of an information or weather signal was about 25 characters.&lt;ref name="Rijmenants-Kurzsignale"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rijmenants |first=Dirk |title=Kurzsignale on German U-boats |url=http://users.telenet.be/d.rijmenants/en/kurzsignale.htm |work=Cipher Machines and Cryptology |accessdate=2016-11-21 |postscript=&amp;nbsp;(The article gives full details and examples of Kurzsignale and Wetterkurzschlüssel encoding)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conventional RDF needed about a minute to fix the bearing of a radio signal, and the Kurzsignale protected against this. However, the [[huff-duff]] system which was in use by the Allies could cope with these short transmissions.

The fully automated [[burst transmission]] ''Kurier system'', in testing from August 1944, could send a ''Kurzsignal'' in not more than 460&amp;nbsp;milliseconds; this was short enough to prevent location even by [[High-frequency direction finding|huff-duff]] and, if deployed, would have been a serious setback for Allied anti-submarine and code-breaking activities. By late 1944 the ''Kurier'' program was a top priority, but the war ended before the system was operational.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ww2aircraft.net/forum/ww2-general/august-19-1942-a-33717-2.html Aircraft of World War II: thread August 19, 1942]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Short Weather cipher==
A similar coding system was used for weather reports from U-boats, the ''[[Short Weather Cipher|Wetterkurzschlüssel]]'' (Short Weather Cipher). Code books were captured from {{GS|U-559||2}} on 30 October 1942.&lt;ref name="Budiansky-2000-BWC-341"&gt;{{cite book |last=Budiansky |first=Stephen |year=2000 |title=Battle of Wits: The Complete Story of Codebreaking in World War II |publisher=Free Press |publication-place=New York, NY |pages=341–343 |isbn=978-0-684-85932-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[proof compression]] LowerUnits ('''LU''') is an algorithm used to compress [[propositional logic]] resolution proofs. The main idea of LowerUnits is to exploit the following fact:&lt;ref&gt;Fontaine, Pascal; Merz, Stephan; Woltzenlogel Paleo, Bruno. ''Compression of Propositional Resolution Proofs via Partial Regularization''. 23rd International Conference on Automated Deduction, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

 '''Theorem:''' Let &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; be a potentially [[redundant proof]], and &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; be the redundant proof | redundant node. If &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt;’s [[clause (logic)|clause]] is a [[unit clause]], 
 then &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is redundant.

The algorithm targets exactly the class of [[Redundant_proof#Global_Redundancy | global redundancy]] stemming from multiple resolutions with unit clauses. The algorithm takes its name from the fact that, when this rewriting is done and the resulting proof is displayed as a DAG ([[directed acyclic graph]]), the unit node &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; appears lower (i.e., closer to the root) than it used to appear in the original proof. 

A naive implementation exploiting theorem would require the proof to be traversed and fixed after each unit node is lowered. It is possible, however, to do better by first collecting and removing all the unit nodes in a single traversal, and afterwards fixing the whole proof in a single second traversal. Finally, the collected and fixed unit nodes have to be reinserted at the bottom of the proof.

Care must be taken with cases when a unit node &lt;math&gt;\eta^{\prime}&lt;/math&gt; occurs above in the subproof that derives another unit node &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt;. In such cases, &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; depends on &lt;math&gt;\eta^{\prime}&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; be the single literal of the unit clause of &lt;math&gt;\eta^{\prime}&lt;/math&gt;. Then any occurrence of &lt;math&gt;\overline{\ell}&lt;/math&gt; in the subproof above &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; will not be cancelled by resolution inferences with &lt;math&gt;\eta^{\prime}&lt;/math&gt; anymore. Consequently, &lt;math&gt;\overline{\ell}&lt;/math&gt; will be propagated downwards when the proof is fixed and will appear in the clause of &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt;. Difficulties with such dependencies can be easily avoided if we reinsert the upper unit node &lt;math&gt;\eta^{\prime}&lt;/math&gt; after reinserting the unit node &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. after reinsertion, &lt;math&gt;\eta^{\prime}&lt;/math&gt; must appear below &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt;, to cancel the extra literal &lt;math&gt;\overline{\ell}&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt;’s clause). This can be ensured by collecting the unit nodes in a queue during a bottom-up traversal of the proof and reinserting them in the order they were queued.

The algorithm for fixing a proof containing many roots performs a top-down traversal of the proof, recomputing the resolvents and replacing broken nodes (e.g. nodes having deletedNodeMarker as one of their parents) by their surviving parents (e.g. the other parent, in case one parent was deletedNodeMarker).

When unit nodes are collected and removed from a proof of a clause &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; and the proof is fixed, the clause &lt;math&gt;\kappa^{\prime}&lt;/math&gt; in the root node of the new proof is not equal to &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; anymore, but contains (some of) the duals of the literals of the unit clauses that have been removed from the proof. The reinsertion of unit nodes at the bottom of the proof resolves &lt;math&gt;\kappa^{\prime}&lt;/math&gt; with the clauses of (some of) the collected unit nodes, in order to obtain a proof of &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; again.

== Algorithm ==

General structure of the algorithm

{{algorithm-begin|name=LowerUnits}}
   Input: A proof &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;
   Output: A proof &lt;math&gt;\psi^{\prime}&lt;/math&gt; with no global redundancy with unit redundant node

   (unitsQueue, &lt;math&gt;\psi_{b}&lt;/math&gt;) ← collectUnits(&lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;); 
   &lt;math&gt;\psi_{f}&lt;/math&gt; ← fix(&lt;math&gt;\psi_{b}&lt;/math&gt;); 
   fixedUnitsQueue ← fix(unitsQueue); 
   &lt;math&gt;\psi^{\prime}&lt;/math&gt; ← reinsertUnits(&lt;math&gt;\psi_{f}&lt;/math&gt;, fixedUnitsQueue);
   '''return''' &lt;math&gt;\psi^{\prime}&lt;/math&gt;;
{{algorithm-end}}

We collect the unit clauses as follow

{{algorithm-begin|name=CollectUnits}}
   Input: A proof &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;
   Output: A pair containing a queue of all unit nodes (unitsQueue) that are used more than once in &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; and a broken proof &lt;math&gt;\psi_{b}&lt;/math&gt;

 &lt;math&gt;\psi_{b}&lt;/math&gt; ← &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;; 
 traverse &lt;math&gt;\psi_{b}&lt;/math&gt; bottom-up and '''foreach''' node &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\psi_{b}&lt;/math&gt; '''do'''
   '''if''' &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; is unit and &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; has more than one child '''then'''
       add &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; to unitsQueue; 
       remove &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;\psi_{b}&lt;/math&gt;; 
   '''end'''
 '''end'''
 '''return''' (unitsQueue, &lt;math&gt;\psi_{b}&lt;/math&gt;); 
{{algorithm-end}}

Then we reinsert the units

{{algorithm-begin|name=ReinsertUnits}}
   Input: A proof &lt;math&gt;\psi_{f}&lt;/math&gt; (with a single root) and a queue &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; of root nodes 
   Output: A proof &lt;math&gt;\psi^{\prime}&lt;/math&gt;

 &lt;math&gt;\psi^{\prime}&lt;/math&gt; ← &lt;math&gt;\psi_{f}&lt;/math&gt;; 
 '''while''' &lt;math&gt;q\neq\emptyset&lt;/math&gt; '''do'''
      &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; ← first element of &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;;
      &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; ← tail of &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;;
      '''if''' &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; is resolvable with root of &lt;math&gt;\psi^{\prime}&lt;/math&gt; '''then'''
         &lt;math&gt;\psi^{\prime}&lt;/math&gt; ← resolvent of &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; with the root of &lt;math&gt;\psi^{\prime}&lt;/math&gt;; 
      '''end''' 
 '''end'''
 '''return''' &lt;math&gt;\psi^{\prime}&lt;/math&gt;;
{{algorithm-end}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7274">In [[mathematics]], the '''Menger curvature''' of a triple of points in ''n''-[[dimension]]al [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of the [[radius]] of the circle that passes through the three points. It is named after the [[Austria]]n-[[United States|American]] [[mathematician]] [[Karl Menger]].

==Definition==

Let ''x'', ''y'' and ''z'' be three points in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;; for simplicity, assume for the moment that all three points are distinct and do not lie on a single straight line. Let Π&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; be the [[Plane (mathematics)|Euclidean plane]] spanned by ''x'', ''y'' and ''z'' and let ''C''&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;Π be the unique [[circle|Euclidean circle]] in Π that passes through ''x'', ''y'' and ''z'' (the [[Circumscribed circle|circumcircle]] of ''x'', ''y'' and ''z''). Let ''R'' be the radius of ''C''. Then the '''Menger curvature''' ''c''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'',&amp;nbsp;''z'') of ''x'', ''y'' and ''z'' is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;c (x, y, z) = \frac1{R}.&lt;/math&gt;

If the three points are [[Line (geometry)|collinear]], ''R'' can be informally considered to be +∞, and it makes rigorous sense to define ''c''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'',&amp;nbsp;''z'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. If any of the points ''x'', ''y'' and ''z'' are coincident, again define ''c''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'',&amp;nbsp;''z'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.

Using the well-known formula relating the side lengths of a [[triangle]] to its area, it follows that

:&lt;math&gt;c (x, y, z) = \frac1{R} = \frac{4 A}{| x - y | | y - z | | z - x |},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''A'' denotes the area of the triangle spanned by ''x'', ''y'' and ''z''.

Another way of computing Menger curvature is the identity
:&lt;math&gt; c(x,y,z)=\frac{2\sin \angle xyz}{|x-z|}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\angle xyz&lt;/math&gt; is the angle made at the ''y''-corner of the triangle spanned by ''x'',''y'',''z''.

Menger curvature may also be defined on a general [[metric space]]. If ''X'' is a metric space and ''x'',''y'', and ''z'' are distinct points, let ''f'' be an [[isometry]] from &lt;math&gt;\{x,y,z\}&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{2}&lt;/math&gt;. Define the Menger curvature of these points to be

:&lt;math&gt; c_{X} (x,y,z)=c(f(x),f(y),f(z)).&lt;/math&gt;

Note that ''f'' need not be defined on all of ''X'', just on ''{x,y,z}'', and the value ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; ''(x,y,z)'' is independent of the choice of ''f''.

==Integral Curvature Rectifiability==

Menger curvature can be used to give quantitative conditions for when sets in &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R}^{n} &lt;/math&gt; may be [[Rectifiable set|rectifiable]]. For a [[Borel measure]] &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; on a Euclidean space &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R}^{n}&lt;/math&gt; define

: &lt;math&gt; c^{p}(\mu)=\int\int\int c(x,y,z)^{p}d\mu(x)d\mu(y)d\mu(z).&lt;/math&gt;

* A Borel set &lt;math&gt; E\subseteq \mathbb{R}^{n} &lt;/math&gt; is rectifiable if &lt;math&gt; c^{2}(H^{1}|_{E})&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; H^{1}|_{E} &lt;/math&gt; denotes one-dimensional [[Hausdorff measure]] restricted to the set &lt;math&gt; E&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The basic intuition behind the result is that Menger curvature measures how straight a given triple of points are (the smaller &lt;math&gt; c(x,y,z)\max\{|x-y|,|y-z|,|z-y|\}&lt;/math&gt; is, the closer x,y, and z are to being collinear), and this integral quantity being finite is saying that the set E is flat on most small scales.  In particular, if the power in the integral is larger, our set is smoother than just being rectifiable&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The result is not true for &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{2}&lt;s&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; c^{2s}(H^{s}|_{E})=\infty&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt; 1&lt;s\leq n&lt;/math&gt;.:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

* If &lt;math&gt;E\subseteq\Gamma\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{2}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; H^{1}(E)&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is rectifiable. Then there is a positive Radon measure &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; supported on &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; satisfying &lt;math&gt; \mu B(x,r)\leq r&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x\in E&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;c^{2}(\mu)&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; (in particular, this measure is the [[Frostman's lemma|Frostman measure]] associated to E). Moreover, if &lt;math&gt;H^{1}(B(x,r)\cap\Gamma)\leq Cr&lt;/math&gt; for some constant ''C'' and all &lt;math&gt; x\in \Gamma&lt;/math&gt; and ''r&gt;0'', then &lt;math&gt; c^{2}(H^{1}|_{E})&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;. This last result follows from the [[Analyst's Traveling Salesman Theorem]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13447">In [[formal ontology]], a branch of [[metaphysics]], and in [[ontology (computer science)|ontological computer science]], '''mereotopology''' is a [[first-order theory]], embodying [[mereology|mereological]] and [[topological]] concepts, of the relations among wholes, parts, parts of parts, and the [[boundary (topology)|boundaries]] between parts. 

==History and motivation==
Mereotopology begins in philosophy with theories articulated by [[A. N. Whitehead]] in several books and articles he published between 1916 and 1929, drawing in part on the mereogeometry of De Laguna (1922). The first to have proposed the idea of a point-free definition of the concept of topological space in mathematics was [[Karl Menger]] in his book ''Dimensionstheorie'' (1928) -- see also his (1940). The early historical background of mereotopology is documented in Bélanger and Marquis (2013) and Whitehead's early work is discussed in Kneebone (1963: chpt. 13.5) and Simons (1987: 2.9.1).&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Peter Simons, "Whitehead and Mereology", in Guillaume Durand et [[Michel Weber]] (éditeurs), ''[https://www.academia.edu/279950/Les_principes_de_la_connaissance_naturelle_dAlfred_North_Whitehead_-_Alfred_North_Whiteheads_Principles_of_Natural_Knowledge Les principes de la connaissance naturelle d’Alfred North Whitehead — Alfred North Whitehead’s Principles of Natural Knowledge]'', Frankfurt / Paris / Lancaster, ontos verlag, 2007. See also the relevant entries of [[Michel Weber]] and Will Desmond, (eds.), ''[https://www.academia.edu/279955/Handbook_of_Whiteheadian_Process_Thought Handbook of Whiteheadian Process Thought]'', Frankfurt / Lancaster, ontos verlag, Process Thought X1 &amp; X2, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of Whitehead's 1929 ''[[Process and Reality]]'' augmented the part-whole relation with topological notions such as [[contact (mathematics)|contiguity]] and [[connected space|connection]]. Despite Whitehead's acumen as a mathematician, his theories were insufficiently formal, even flawed. By showing how Whitehead's theories could be fully formalized and repaired, Clarke (1981, 1985) founded contemporary mereotopology.&lt;ref&gt;Casati &amp; Varzi (1999: chpt. 4) and Biacino &amp; Gerla (1991) have reservations about some aspects of Clarke's formulation.&lt;/ref&gt; The theories of Clarke and Whitehead are discussed in Simons (1987: 2.10.2), and Lucas (2000: chpt. 10). The entry [[Whitehead's point-free geometry]] includes two contemporary treatments of Whitehead's theories, due to Giangiacomo Gerla, each different from the theory set out in the next section.

Although mereotopology is a mathematical theory, we owe its subsequent development to [[logic]]ians and theoretical [[computer science|computer scientists]]. Lucas (2000: chpt. 10) and Casati and Varzi (1999: chpts. 4,5) are introductions to mereotopology that can be read by anyone having done a course in [[first-order logic]]. More advanced treatments of mereotopology include Cohn and Varzi (2003) and, for the mathematically sophisticated, Roeper (1997). For a mathematical treatment of [[point-free geometry]], see Gerla (1995).  [[lattice (order)|Lattice]]-theoretic ([[algebraic structure|algebraic]]) treatments of mereotopology as [[contact algebra]]s have been applied to separate the [[topology|topological]] from the [[mereology|mereological]] structure, see Stell (2000), Düntsch and Winter (2004).

==Applications==
[[Barry Smith (ontologist)|Barry Smith]] (1996), Anthony Cohn, [[Achille Varzi (philosopher) | Achille Varzi]] and their co-authors have shown that mereotopology can be useful in [[formal ontology]] and [[ontology (computer science)|computer science]], by allowing the formalization of relations such as [[contact (mathematics)|contact]], [[connected space|connection]], [[boundary (topology)|boundaries]], [[interior (topology)|interior]]s, holes, and so on. Mereotopology has been applied also as a tool for qualitative [[spatial-temporal reasoning]], with constraint calculi such as the [[Region Connection Calculus]] (RCC). It provides the starting point for the theory of fiat boundaries developed by Smith and Varzi (2000), which grew out of the attempt to distinguish formally between 
*boundaries (in geography, geopolitics, and other domains) which reflect more or less arbitrary human demarcations and
*boundaries which reflect bona fide physical discontinuities (Smith 1995, 2001). 
Mereotopology is being applied by Salustri in the domain of digital manufacturing (Salustri, 2002) and by Smith and Varzi to the formalization of basic notions of ecology and environmental biology (Smith and Varzi, 1999, 2002). It has been applied also to deal with vague boundaries in geography (Smith and Mark, 2003), in [[ecological psychology]] (Smith, 2000), and in the study of vagueness and granularity (Smith and Brogaard, 2002, Bittner and Smith, 2001, 2001a).

==Preferred approach of Casati &amp; Varzi==
Casati and Varzi (1999: chpt.4) set out a variety of mereotopological theories in a consistent notation. This section sets out several nested theories that culminate in their preferred theory '''GEMTC''', and follows their exposition closely. The mereological part of '''GEMTC''' is the conventional theory '''[[mereology|GEM]]'''. Casati and Varzi do not say if the [[model theory|models]] of '''GEMTC''' include any conventional [[topological space]]s.

We begin with some [[domain of discourse]], whose elements are called [[individual]]s (a [[synonym]] for [[mereology]] is "the calculus of individuals"). Casati and Varzi prefer limiting the ontology to physical objects, but others freely employ mereotopology to reason about geometric figures and events, and to solve problems posed by research in [[machine intelligence]].

An upper case Latin letter denotes both a [[relation (mathematics)|relation]] and the [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]] letter referring to that relation in [[first-order logic]]. Lower case letters from the end of the alphabet denote variables ranging over the domain; letters from the start of the alphabet are names of arbitrary individuals. If a formula begins with an [[atomic formula]] followed by the [[biconditional]], the subformula to the right of the biconditional is a definition of the atomic formula, whose variables are [[bound variable|unbound]]. Otherwise, variables not explicitly quantified are tacitly [[universal quantifier|universally quantified]]. The axiom '''Cn''' below corresponds to axiom '''C.n''' in Casati and Varzi (1999: chpt. 4).

We begin with a topological primitive, a [[binary relation]] called ''connection''; the atomic formula ''Cxy'' denotes that "''x'' is connected to ''y''." Connection is governed, at minimum, by the axioms:

'''C1'''. &lt;math&gt;\ Cxx.&lt;/math&gt; ([[Reflexive relation|reflexive]])

'''C2'''. &lt;math&gt; Cxy \rightarrow Cyx.&lt;/math&gt; ([[Symmetric relation|symmetric]])

Now posit the binary relation ''E'', defined as:

&lt;math&gt;Exy \leftrightarrow [Czx \rightarrow Czy].&lt;/math&gt;

''Exy'' is read as "''y'' encloses ''x''" and is also topological in nature. A consequence of '''C1-2''' is that ''E'' is [[Reflexive relation|reflexive]] and [[Transitive relation|transitive]], and hence a [[preorder]]. If ''E'' is also assumed [[axiom of extensionality|extensional]], so that:

&lt;math&gt; (Exa \leftrightarrow Exb) \leftrightarrow (a=b),&lt;/math&gt;

then ''E'' can be proved [[Antisymmetric relation|antisymmetric]] and thus becomes a [[partial order]]. Enclosure, notated ''xKy'', is the single primitive relation of the [[Whitehead's point-free geometry|theories in Whitehead (1919, 1925)]], the starting point of mereotopology. 

Let ''parthood'' be the defining primitive [[binary relation]] of the underlying [[mereology]], and let the [[atomic formula]] ''Pxy'' denote that "''x'' is part of ''y''". We assume that ''P'' is a [[partial order]]. Call the resulting minimalist mereological theory '''M'''. 

If ''x'' is part of ''y'', we postulate that ''y'' encloses ''x'':

'''C3'''. &lt;math&gt;\ Pxy \rightarrow Exy.&lt;/math&gt;

'''C3''' nicely connects [[mereology|mereological]] parthood to [[topological]] enclosure.

Let ''O'', the binary relation of mereological ''overlap'', be defined as:

&lt;math&gt; Oxy \leftrightarrow \exist z[Pzx \land\ Pzy].&lt;/math&gt;

Let ''Oxy'' denote that "''x'' and ''y'' overlap." With ''O'' in hand, a consequence of '''C3''' is:

&lt;math&gt;Oxy \rightarrow Cxy.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the [[Conversion (logic)|converse]] does not necessarily hold. While things that overlap are necessarily connected, connected things do not necessarily overlap. If this were not the case, [[topology]] would merely be a model of [[mereology]] (in which "overlap" is always either primitive or defined).

Ground mereotopology ('''MT''') is the theory consisting of primitive ''C'' and ''P'', defined ''E'' and ''O'', the axioms '''C1-3''', and axioms assuring that ''P'' is a [[partial order]]. Replacing the '''M''' in '''MT''' with the standard [[axiom of extension|extensional]] mereology '''[[mereology|GEM]]''' results in the theory '''GEMT'''.

Let ''IPxy'' denote that "''x'' is an internal part of ''y''." ''IP'' is defined as:

&lt;math&gt;IPxy \leftrightarrow (Pxy \land (Czx \rightarrow Ozy)).&lt;/math&gt;

Let σ''x'' φ(''x'') denote the mereological sum (fusion) of all individuals in the domain satisfying φ(''x''). σ is a [[bound variable|variable binding]] [[Substring|prefix]] operator. The axioms of '''GEM''' assure that this sum exists if φ(''x'') is a [[first-order logic|first-order formula]]. With σ and the relation ''IP'' in hand, we can define the [[interior (topology)|interior]] of ''x'', &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{i}x,&lt;/math&gt; as the mereological sum of all interior parts ''z'' of ''x'', or:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{i}x =&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;df&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt; \sigma z[IPzx].&lt;/math&gt;

Two easy consequences of this definition are:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{i}W = W,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''W'' is the universal individual, and

'''C5'''.&lt;ref&gt;The axiom '''C4''' of Casati and Varzi (1999) is irrelevant to this entry.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;math&gt;\ P(\mathbf{i}x)x.&lt;/math&gt; ([[inclusion (set theory)|Inclusion]])

The operator '''i''' has two more axiomatic properties:

'''C6'''. &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{i}(\mathbf{i}x) = \mathbf{i}x.&lt;/math&gt; ([[Idempotence]])

'''C7'''. &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{i}(x \times y) = \mathbf{i}x \times \mathbf{i}y,&lt;/math&gt; 

where ''a''&amp;times;''b'' is the mereological product of ''a'' and ''b'', not defined when ''Oab'' is false. '''i''' distributes over product.

It can now be seen that '''i''' is [[isomorphic]] to the [[interior operator]] of [[topology]]. Hence the [[Duality (mathematics)|dual]] of '''i''', the topological [[closure operator]] '''c''', can be defined in terms of '''i''', and [[Kuratowski]]'s axioms for '''c''' are theorems. Likewise, given an axiomatization of '''c''' that is analogous to '''C5-7''', '''i''' may be defined in terms of '''c''', and '''C5-7''' become theorems.  Adding '''C5-7''' to '''GEMT''' results in Casati and Varzi's preferred mereotopological theory, '''GEMTC'''.

''x'' is ''self-connected'' if it satisfies the following predicate:

&lt;math&gt; SCx \leftrightarrow ((Owx \leftrightarrow (Owy \lor Owz)) \rightarrow Cyz).&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the primitive and defined predicates of '''MT''' alone suffice for this definition. The predicate ''SC'' enables formalizing the necessary condition given in [[A. N. Whitehead|Whitehead]]'s ''[[Process and Reality]]'' for the mereological sum of two individuals to exist: they must be connected. Formally:

'''C8'''. &lt;math&gt; Cxy \rightarrow \exist z[SCz \land Ozx \land (Pwz \rightarrow (Owx \lor Owy)).&lt;/math&gt;

Given some mereotopology '''X''', adding '''C8''' to '''X'''  results in what Casati and Varzi call the ''Whiteheadian extension'' of '''X''', denoted '''WX'''. Hence the theory whose axioms are '''C1-8''' is '''WGEMTC'''.

The converse of '''C8''' is a '''GEMTC''' theorem. Hence given the axioms of '''GEMTC''', ''C'' is a defined predicate if ''O'' and ''SC'' are taken as primitive predicates.

If the underlying mereology is [[Atomic formula|atom]]less and weaker than '''GEM''', the axiom that assures the absence of atoms ('''P9''' in Casati and Varzi 1999) may be replaced by '''C9''', which postulates that no individual has a [[boundary (topology)|topological boundary]]:

'''C9'''. &lt;math&gt; \forall x \exist y[Pyx \land (Czy \rightarrow Ozx) \land \lnot (Pxy \land (Czx \rightarrow Ozy))].&lt;/math&gt;

When the domain consists of geometric figures, the boundaries can be points, curves, and surfaces. What boundaries could mean, given other ontologies, is not an easy matter and is discussed in Casati and Varzi (1999: chpt. 5).

In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] field of [[differential geometry]], a '''metric tensor''' is a type of function which takes as input a pair of [[tangent vector]]s {{mvar|v}} and {{mvar|w}} at a point of a surface (or higher dimensional [[differentiable manifold]]) and produces a [[real number]] [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] {{math|''g''(''v'', ''w'')}} in a way that generalizes many of the familiar properties of the [[dot product]] of [[Vector (geometry)|vectors]] in [[Euclidean space]].  In the same way as a dot product, metric tensors are used to define the length of and angle between tangent vectors.  Through [[integral|integration]], the metric tensor allows one to define and compute the length of curves on the manifold.

A metric tensor is called ''positive-definite'' if it assigns a positive value {{math|''g''(''v'', ''v'') &gt; 0}} to every nonzero vector {{mvar|v}}.  A manifold equipped with a positive-definite metric tensor is known as a [[Riemannian manifold]].  On a Riemannian manifold, the curve connecting two points that (locally) has the smallest length is called a [[geodesic]], and its length is the distance that a passenger in the manifold needs to traverse to go from one point to the other.  Equipped with this notion of length, a Riemannian manifold is a [[metric space]], meaning that it has a [[metric (mathematics)|distance function]] {{math|''d''(''p'', ''q'')}} whose value at a pair of points {{mvar|p}} and {{mvar|q}} is the distance from {{mvar|p}} to {{mvar|q}}.  Conversely, the metric tensor itself is the [[derivative]] of the distance function (taken in a suitable manner).  Thus the metric tensor gives the ''infinitesimal'' distance on the manifold.

While the notion of a metric tensor was known in some sense to mathematicians such as [[Carl Gauss]] from the early 19th century, it was not until the early 20th century that its properties as a [[tensor]] were understood by, in particular, [[Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro]] and [[Tullio Levi-Civita]], who first codified the notion of a tensor.  The metric tensor is an example of a [[tensor field]].

The components of a metric tensor in a [[coordinate basis]] take on the form of a [[symmetric matrix]] whose entries transform [[covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariantly]] under changes to the coordinate system.  Thus a metric tensor is a covariant [[symmetric tensor]].  From the [[Coordinate-free|coordinate-independent]] point of view, a metric tensor field is defined to be a [[nondegenerate form|nondegenerate]] [[symmetric bilinear form]] on each tangent space that varies [[smooth function|smoothly]] from point to point.

==Introduction==
[[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] in his 1827 ''[[#CITEREFGauss1827|Disquisitiones generales circa superficies curvas]]'' (''General investigations of curved surfaces'') considered a surface [[parametric surface|parametrically]], with the [[Cartesian coordinates]] {{mvar|x}}, {{mvar|y}}, and {{mvar|z}} of points on the surface depending on two auxiliary variables {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|v}}. Thus a parametric surface is (in today's terms) a [[vector-valued function]]

:&lt;math&gt;\vec{r}(u,v) = \bigl( x(u,v), y(u,v), z(u,v) \bigr)&lt;/math&gt;

depending on an [[ordered pair]] of real variables {{math|(''u'', ''v'')}}, and defined in an [[open set]] {{mvar|D}} in the {{mvar|uv}}-plane. One of the chief aims of Gauss's investigations was to deduce those features of the surface which could be described by a function which would remain unchanged if the surface underwent a transformation in space (such as bending the surface without stretching it), or a change in the particular parametric form of the same geometrical surface.

One natural such invariant quantity is the [[arclength|length of a curve]] drawn along the surface. Another is the [[angle]] between a pair of curves drawn along the surface and meeting at a common point. A third such quantity is the [[area]] of a piece of the surface. The study of these invariants of a surface led Gauss to introduce the predecessor of the modern notion of the metric tensor.

===Arc length===
If the variables {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|v}} are taken to depend on a third variable, {{mvar|t}}, taking values in an [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}, then {{math|{{vec|''r''}}(''u''(''t''), ''v''(''t''))}} will trace out a [[parametric curve]] in parametric surface {{mvar|M}}. The [[arc length]] of that curve is given by the [[integral]]

: &lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
  s &amp;= \int_a^b\left\|\frac{d}{dt}\vec{r}(u(t),v(t))\right\|\,dt \\
    &amp;= \int_a^b \sqrt{u'(t)^2\,\vec{r}_u\cdot\vec{r}_u + 2u'(t)v'(t)\, \vec{r}_u\cdot\vec{r}_v + v'(t)^2\,\vec{r}_v\cdot\vec{r}_v}\, dt \,,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \left\| \cdot \right\| &lt;/math&gt; represents the [[Norm (mathematics)#Euclidean norm|Euclidean norm]]. Here the [[chain rule]] has been applied, and the subscripts denote [[partial derivative]]s:

:&lt;math&gt;\vec{r}_u = \frac{\partial \vec{r}}{\partial u}\,, \quad \vec{r}_v = \frac{\partial \vec{r}}{\partial v}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The integrand is the restriction&lt;ref&gt;More precisely, the integrand is the [[pullback (differential geometry)|pullback]] of this differential to the curve.&lt;/ref&gt; to the curve of the square root of the ([[quadratic form|quadratic]]) [[differential (infinitesimal)|differential]]

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;(ds)^2 = E \,(du)^2 + 2F \,du\, dv + G\, (dv)^2 ,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

where

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
  E = \vec r_u \cdot \vec r_u, \quad
  F = \vec r_u \cdot \vec r_v , \quad
  G = \vec r_v \cdot \vec r_v .
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

The quantity {{mvar|ds}} in ({{EquationNote|1}}) is called the [[line element]], while {{math|''ds''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} is called the [[first fundamental form]] of {{mvar|M}}. Intuitively, it represents the [[principal part]] of the square of the displacement undergone by {{math|{{vec|''r''}}(''u'', ''v'')}} when {{mvar|u}} is increased by {{mvar|du}} units, and {{mvar|v}} is increased by {{mvar|dv}} units.

Using matrix notation, the first fundamental form becomes
:&lt;math&gt;ds^2 =
  \begin{bmatrix} du &amp; dv \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix} E &amp; F \\ F &amp; G \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix} du \\ dv \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Coordinate transformations===
Suppose now that a different parameterization is selected, by allowing {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|v}} to depend on another pair of variables {{math|''u''′}} and {{math|''v''′}}. Then the analog of ({{EquationNote|2}}) for the new variables is
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
  E' = \vec r_{u'} \cdot \vec r_{u'}, \quad
  F' = \vec r_{u'} \cdot \vec r_{v'}, \quad
  G' = \vec r_{v'} \cdot \vec r_{v'}.
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2'}}}}

The [[chain rule]] relates {{math|''E''′}}, {{math|''F''′}}, and {{math|''G''′}} to {{mvar|E}}, {{mvar|F}}, and {{mvar|G}} via the [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] equation

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} E' &amp; F' \\ F' &amp; G' \end{bmatrix} =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \frac{\partial u}{\partial u'} &amp; \frac{\partial u}{\partial v'} \\
    \frac{\partial v}{\partial u'} &amp; \frac{\partial v}{\partial v'}
  \end{bmatrix}^\mathsf{T}
  \begin{bmatrix} E &amp; F \\ F &amp; G \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \frac{\partial u}{\partial u'} &amp; \frac{\partial u}{\partial v'} \\
    \frac{\partial v}{\partial u'} &amp; \frac{\partial v}{\partial v'}
  \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

where the superscript T denotes the [[matrix transpose]]. The matrix with the coefficients {{mvar|E}}, {{mvar|F}}, and {{mvar|G}} arranged in this way therefore transforms by the [[Jacobian matrix]] of the coordinate change

:&lt;math&gt;
  J = \begin{bmatrix}
    \frac{\partial u}{\partial u'} &amp; \frac{\partial u}{\partial v'} \\
    \frac{\partial v}{\partial u'} &amp; \frac{\partial v}{\partial v'}
\end{bmatrix}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

A matrix which transforms in this way is one kind of what is called a [[tensor]]. The matrix

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} E &amp; F \\ F &amp; G \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

with the transformation law ({{EquationNote|3}}) is known as the metric tensor of the surface.

===Invariance of arclength under coordinate transformations===
{{harvtxt|Ricci-Curbastro|Levi-Civita|1900}} first observed the significance of a system of coefficients {{mvar|E}}, {{mvar|F}}, and {{mvar|G}}, that transformed in this way on passing from one system of coordinates to another. The upshot is that the first fundamental form ({{EquationNote|1}}) is ''invariant'' under changes in the coordinate system, and that this follows exclusively from the transformation properties of {{mvar|E}}, {{mvar|F}}, and {{mvar|G}}. Indeed, by the chain rule,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} du \\ dv \end{bmatrix} =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \frac{\partial u}{\partial u'} &amp; \frac{\partial u}{\partial v'} \\
    \frac{\partial v}{\partial u'} &amp; \frac{\partial v}{\partial v'}
  \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix} du' \\ dv' \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

so that

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  ds^2
  &amp;=
    \begin{bmatrix} du &amp; dv \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix} E &amp; F \\ F &amp; G \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix} du \\ dv \end{bmatrix} \\
  &amp;=
    \begin{bmatrix} du' &amp; dv' \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
      \frac{\partial u}{\partial u'} &amp; \frac{\partial u}{\partial v'} \\
      \frac{\partial v}{\partial u'} &amp; \frac{\partial v}{\partial v'}
    \end{bmatrix}^\mathsf{T}
    \begin{bmatrix} E &amp; F \\ F &amp; G \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
      \frac{\partial u}{\partial u'} &amp; \frac{\partial u}{\partial v'} \\
      \frac{\partial v}{\partial u'} &amp; \frac{\partial v}{\partial v'}
    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix} du' \\ dv' \end{bmatrix} \\
  &amp;=
    \begin{bmatrix} du' &amp; dv' \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix} E' &amp; F' \\ F' &amp; G' \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix} du' \\ dv' \end{bmatrix}\\
  &amp;= \left(ds'\right)^2 \,.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

===Length and angle===
Another interpretation of the metric tensor, also considered by Gauss, is that it provides a way in which to compute the length of [[tangent vector]]s to the surface, as well as the angle between two tangent vectors. In contemporary terms, the metric tensor allows one to compute the [[dot product]] of tangent vectors in a manner independent of the parametric description of the surface. Any tangent vector at a point of the parametric surface {{mvar|M}} can be written in the form

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p} = p_1\vec{r}_u + p_2\vec{r}_v&lt;/math&gt;

for suitable real numbers {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}. If two tangent vectors are given:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \mathbf{a} &amp;= a_1\vec{r}_u + a_2\vec{r}_v \\
  \mathbf{b} &amp;= b_1\vec{r}_u + b_2\vec{r}_v
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

then using the [[bilinear transform|bilinearity]] of the dot product,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}
    &amp;= a_1 b_1 \vec{r}_u\cdot\vec{r}_u + a_1b_2 \vec{r}_u\cdot\vec{r}_v + b_1a_2 \vec{r}_v\cdot\vec{r}_u + a_2 b_2 \vec{r}_v\cdot\vec{r}_v \\[8pt]
    &amp;= a_1 b_1 E + a_1b_2 F + b_1a_2 F + a_2b_2G \\[8pt]
    &amp;= \begin{bmatrix} a_1 &amp; a_2 \end{bmatrix}
         \begin{bmatrix} E &amp; F \\ F &amp; G \end{bmatrix}
         \begin{bmatrix} b_1 \\ b_2 \end{bmatrix} \,.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This is plainly a function of the four variables {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and {{math|''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}. It is more profitably viewed, however, as a function that takes a pair of arguments {{math|'''a''' {{=}} [''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]}} and {{math|'''b''' {{=}} [''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]}} which are vectors in the {{mvar|uv}}-plane. That is, put

:&lt;math&gt;g(\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b}) = a_1b_1 E + a_1b_2 F + b_1a_2 F + a_2b_2G \,.&lt;/math&gt;

This is a [[symmetric function]] in {{math|'''a'''}} and {{math|'''b'''}}, meaning that

:&lt;math&gt;g(\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b}) = g(\mathbf{b}, \mathbf{a})\,.&lt;/math&gt;

It is also [[bilinear form|bilinear]], meaning that it is [[linear functional|linear]] in each variable {{math|'''a'''}} and {{math|'''b'''}} separately. That is,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  g\left(\lambda\mathbf{a} + \mu\mathbf{a}', \mathbf{b}\right) &amp;= \lambda g(\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b}) + \mu g\left(\mathbf{a}', \mathbf{b}\right),\quad\text{and} \\
  g\left(\mathbf{a}, \lambda\mathbf{b} + \mu\mathbf{b}'\right) &amp;= \lambda g(\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b}) + \mu g\left(\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b}'\right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

for any vectors {{math|'''a'''}}, {{math|'''a'''′}}, {{math|'''b'''}}, and {{math|'''b'''′}} in the {{mvar|uv}} plane, and any real numbers {{mvar|μ}} and {{mvar|λ}}.

In particular, the length of a tangent vector {{math|'''a'''}} is given by

:&lt;math&gt; \left\| \mathbf{a} \right\| = \sqrt{g(\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{a})}&lt;/math&gt;

and the angle {{mvar|θ}} between two vectors {{math|'''a'''}} and {{math|'''b'''}} is calculated by

:&lt;math&gt;\cos(\theta) = \frac{g(\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b})}{ \left\| \mathbf{a} \right\| \left\| \mathbf{b} \right\| } \,.&lt;/math&gt;

===Area===
The [[surface area]] is another numerical quantity which should depend only on the surface itself, and not on how it is parameterized. If the surface {{mvar|M}} is parameterized by the function {{math|{{vec|''r''}}(''u'', ''v'')}} over the domain {{mvar|D}} in the {{mvar|uv}}-plane, then the surface area of {{mvar|M}} is given by the integral

:&lt;math&gt;\iint_D \left|\vec{r}_u \times \vec{r}_v\right|\,du\,dv&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|×}} denotes the [[cross product]], and the absolute value denotes the length of a vector in Euclidean space. By [[Lagrange's identity]] for the cross product, the integral can be written

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
       &amp;\iint_D \sqrt{\left(\vec{r}_u\cdot\vec{r}_u\right) \left(\vec{r}_v\cdot\vec{r}_v\right) - \left(\vec{r}_u\cdot\vec{r}_v\right)^2}\,du\,dv \\
   ={} &amp;\iint_D \sqrt{EG - F^2}\,du\,dv\\
   ={} &amp;\iint_D \sqrt{\operatorname{det}\begin{bmatrix} E &amp; F \\ F &amp; G \end{bmatrix}}\, du\, dv
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|det}} is the [[determinant]].

==Definition==
Let {{mvar|M}} be a [[smooth manifold]] of dimension {{mvar|n}}; for instance a [[surface (differential geometry)|surface]] (in the case {{math|''n'' {{=}} 2}}) or [[hypersurface]] in the [[Cartesian space]] {{math|'''ℝ'''&lt;sup&gt;''n'' + 1&lt;/sup&gt;}}. At each point {{math|''p'' ∈ ''M''}} there is a [[vector space]] {{math|T&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;''M''}}, called the [[tangent space]], consisting of all tangent vectors to the manifold at the point {{mvar|p}}. A metric tensor at {{mvar|p}} is a function {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} which takes as inputs a pair of tangent vectors {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} at {{mvar|p}}, and produces as an output a [[real number]] ([[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]]), so that the following conditions are satisfied:
* {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is [[bilinear form|bilinear]]. A function of two vector arguments is bilinear if it is linear separately in each argument. Thus if {{math|''U''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''V''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are three tangent vectors at {{mvar|p}} and {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} are real numbers, then
*:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  g_p\left(aU_p + bV_p, Y_p\right) &amp;= ag_p\left(U_p, Y_p\right) + bg_p\left(V_p, Y_p\right) \,, \quad \text{and} \\
  g_p\left(Y_p, aU_p + bV_p\right) &amp;= ag_p\left(Y_p, U_p\right) + bg_p\left(Y_p, V_p\right) \,.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
* {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is [[symmetric function|symmetric]].&lt;ref&gt;In several formulations of [[classical unified field theories]], the metric tensor was allowed to be non-symmetric; however, the antisymmetric part of such a tensor plays no role in the contexts described here, so it will not be further considered.&lt;/ref&gt; A function of two vector arguments is symmetric provided that for all vectors {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}},
*:&lt;math&gt;g_p\left(X_p, Y_p\right) = g_p\left(Y_p, X_p\right)\,.&lt;/math&gt;
* {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is [[nondegenerate]]. A bilinear function is nondegenerate provided that, for every tangent vector {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; ≠ 0}}, the function
*:&lt;math&gt;Y_p\mapsto g_p\left(X_p,Y_p\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:obtained by holding {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} constant and allowing {{math|''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} to vary is not [[identically zero]]. That is, for every {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; ≠ 0}} there exists a {{math|''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} such that {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;) ≠ 0}}.

A metric tensor field {{mvar|g}} on {{mvar|M}} assigns to each point {{mvar|p}} of {{mvar|M}} a metric tensor {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} in the tangent space at {{mvar|p}} in a way that varies [[smooth function|smoothly]] with {{mvar|p}}. More precisely, given any [[open set|open subset]] {{mvar|U}} of manifold {{mvar|M}} and any (smooth) [[vector field]]s {{mvar|X}} and {{mvar|Y}} on {{mvar|U}}, the real function

:&lt;math&gt;g(X, Y)(p) = g_p\left(X_p, Y_p\right)&lt;/math&gt;

is a smooth function of {{mvar|p}}.

==Components of the metric==
{{Hatnote|This section assumes some familiarity with [[coordinate vector]]s.}}
The components of the metric in any [[basis of a vector space|basis]] of [[vector field]]s, or [[frame bundle|frame]], {{math|'''f''' {{=}}  (''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} are given by&lt;ref&gt;The notation of using square brackets to denote the basis in terms of which the components are calculated is not universal. The notation employed here is modeled on that of {{harvtxt|Wells|1980}}. Typically, such explicit dependence on the basis is entirely suppressed.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;g_{ij}[\mathbf{f}] = g\left(X_i, X_j\right).&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|4}}}}
The {{math|''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} functions {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;['''f''']}} form the entries of an {{math|''n'' × ''n''}} [[symmetric matrix]], {{math|''G''['''f''']}}. If
:&lt;math&gt;v = \sum_{i=1}^n v^iX_i \,, \quad w = \sum_{i=1}^n w^iX_i&lt;/math&gt;
are two vectors at {{math|''p'' ∈ ''U''}}, then the value of the metric applied to {{mvar|v}} and {{mvar|w}} is determined by the coefficients ({{EquationNote|4}}) by bilinearity:

:&lt;math&gt;g(v, w) = \sum_{i,j=1}^n v^iw^jg\left(X_i,X_j\right) = \sum_{i,j=1}^n v^iw^jg_{ij}[\mathbf{f}]&lt;/math&gt;

Denoting the [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] {{math|(''g''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;['''f'''])}} by {{math|''G''['''f''']}} and arranging the components of the vectors {{mvar|v}} and {{mvar|w}} into [[column vector]]s {{math|'''v'''['''f''']}} and {{math|'''w'''['''f''']}},

:&lt;math&gt;g(v,w) = \mathbf{v}[\mathbf{f}]^\mathsf{T} G[\mathbf{f}] \mathbf{w}[\mathbf{f}] = \mathbf{w}[\mathbf{f}]^\mathsf{T} G[\mathbf{f}]\mathbf{v}[\mathbf{f}]&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|'''v'''['''f''']}}&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; and {{math|'''w'''['''f''']}}&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; denote the [[matrix transpose|transpose]] of the vectors {{math|'''v'''['''f''']}} and {{math|'''w'''['''f''']}}, respectively. Under a [[change of basis]] of the form

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f}\mapsto \mathbf{f}' = \left(\sum_k X_ka_{k1},\dots,\sum_k X_ka_{kn}\right) = \mathbf{f}A&lt;/math&gt;

for some [[invertible matrix|invertible]] {{math|''n'' × ''n''}} matrix {{math|''A'' {{=}} (''a''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, the matrix of components of the metric changes by {{mvar|A}} as well. That is,

:&lt;math&gt;G[\mathbf{f}A] = A^\mathsf{T} G[\mathbf{f}]A&lt;/math&gt;

or, in terms of the entries of this matrix,

:&lt;math&gt;g_{ij}[\mathbf{f}A] = \sum_{k,l=1}^n a_{ki}g_{kl}[\mathbf{f}]a_{lj} \, .&lt;/math&gt;

For this reason, the system of quantities {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;['''f''']}} is said to transform covariantly with respect to changes in the frame {{math|'''f'''}}.

===Metric in coordinates===
A system of {{mvar|n}} real-valued functions {{math|(''x''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;)}}, giving a [[local coordinates|local coordinate system]] on an [[open set]] {{mvar|U}} in {{mvar|M}}, determines a basis of vector fields on {{mvar|U}}
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f} = \left(X_1 = \frac{\partial}{\partial x^1}, \dots, X_n = \frac{\partial}{\partial x^n}\right) \,.&lt;/math&gt;

The metric {{mvar|g}} has components relative to this frame given by
:&lt;math&gt;g_{ij}\left[\mathbf{f}\right] = g\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}, \frac{\partial}{\partial x^j}\right) \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Relative to a new system of local coordinates, say
:&lt;math&gt;y^i = y^i(x^1, x^2, \dots, x^n),\quad i=1,2,\dots,n&lt;/math&gt;

the metric tensor will determine a different matrix of coefficients,
:&lt;math&gt;g_{ij}\left[\mathbf{f}'\right] = g\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial y^i}, \frac{\partial}{\partial y^j}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

This new system of functions is related to the original {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;('''f''')}} by means of the [[chain rule]]
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial y^i} = \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{\partial x^k}{\partial y^i}\frac{\partial}{\partial x^k}&lt;/math&gt;

so that
:&lt;math&gt;g_{ij}\left[\mathbf{f}'\right] = \sum_{k,l=1}^n \frac{\partial x^k}{\partial y^i} g_{kl}\left[\mathbf{f}\right]\frac{\partial x^l}{\partial y^j}.&lt;/math&gt;

Or, in terms of the matrices {{math|''G''['''f'''] {{=}} (''g''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;['''f'''])}} and {{math|''G''['''f'''′] {{=}} (''g''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;['''f'''′])}},
:&lt;math&gt;G\left[\mathbf{f}'\right] = \left((Dy)^{-1}\right)^\mathsf{T} G\left[\mathbf{f}\right] (Dy)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|Dy}} denotes the [[Jacobian matrix]] of the coordinate change.

===Signature of a metric===
{{main|Metric signature}}

Associated to any metric tensor is the [[quadratic form]] defined in each tangent space by

:&lt;math&gt;q_m(X_m) = g_m(X_m,X_m) \,, \quad X_m\in T_mM.&lt;/math&gt;

If {{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is positive for all non-zero {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, then the metric is [[definite bilinear form|positive-definite]] at {{mvar|m}}. If the metric is positive-definite at every {{math|''m'' ∈ ''M''}}, then {{mvar|g}} is called a [[Riemannian metric]]. More generally, if the quadratic forms {{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;}} have constant [[signature of a quadratic form|signature]] independent of {{mvar|m}}, then the signature of {{mvar|g}} is this signature, and {{mvar|g}} is called a [[pseudo-Riemannian metric]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dodson|Poston|1991|loc=Chapter VII §3.04}}&lt;/ref&gt; If {{mvar|M}} is [[connected space|connected]], then the signature of {{mvar|q&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;}} does not depend on {{mvar|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vaughn|2007|loc=§3.4.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By [[Sylvester's law of inertia]], a basis of tangent vectors {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} can be chosen locally so that the quadratic form diagonalizes in the following manner

:&lt;math&gt;q_m\left(\sum_i\xi^iX_i\right) = \left(\xi^1\right)^2+\left(\xi^2\right)^2+\cdots+\left(\xi^p\right)^2 - \left(\xi^{p+1}\right)^2-\cdots-\left(\xi^n\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;

for some {{mvar|p}} between 1 and {{mvar|n}}. Any two such expressions of {{mvar|q}} (at the same point {{mvar|m}} of {{mvar|M}}) will have the same number {{mvar|p}} of positive signs. The signature of {{mvar|g}} is the pair of integers {{math|(''p'', ''n'' − ''p'')}}, signifying that there are {{mvar|p}} positive signs and {{math|''n'' − ''p''}} negative signs in any such expression. Equivalently, the metric has signature {{math|(''p'', ''n'' − ''p'')}} if the matrix {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;}} of the metric has {{mvar|p}} positive and {{math|''n'' − ''p''}} negative [[eigenvalue]]s.

Certain metric signatures which arise frequently in applications are:
* If {{mvar|g}} has signature {{math|(''n'', 0)}}, then {{mvar|g}} is a Riemannian metric, and {{mvar|M}} is called a [[Riemannian manifold]]. Otherwise, {{mvar|g}} is a pseudo-Riemannian metric, and {{mvar|M}} is called a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]] (the term semi-Riemannian is also used).
* If {{mvar|M}} is four-dimensional with signature {{math|(1, 3)}} or {{math|(3, 1)}}, then the metric is called [[Lorentzian metric|Lorentzian]]. More generally, a metric tensor in dimension {{mvar|n}} other than 4 of signature {{math|(1, ''n'' − 1)}} or {{math|(''n'' − 1, 1)}} is sometimes also called Lorentzian.
* If {{mvar|M}} is {{math|2''n''}}-dimensional and {{mvar|g}} has signature {{math|(''n'', ''n'')}}, then the metric is called [[ultrahyperbolic metric|ultrahyperbolic]].

===Inverse metric===
Let {{math|'''f''' {{=}} (''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} be a basis of vector fields, and as above let {{math|''G''['''f''']}} be the matrix of coefficients
:&lt;math&gt;g_{ij}[\mathbf{f}] = g\left(X_i,X_j\right) \,.&lt;/math&gt;
One can consider the [[inverse matrix]] {{math|''G''['''f''']&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, which is identified with the '''inverse metric''' (or ''conjugate'' or ''dual metric''). The inverse metric satisfies a transformation law when the frame {{math|'''f'''}} is changed by a matrix {{mvar|A}} via

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;G[\mathbf{f}A]^{-1} = A^{-1}G[\mathbf{f}]^{-1}\left(A^{-1}\right)^\mathsf{T}.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|5}}}}

The inverse metric transforms ''[[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|contravariantly]]'', or with respect to the inverse of the change of basis matrix {{mvar|A}}. Whereas the metric itself provides a way to measure the length of (or angle between) vector fields, the inverse metric supplies a means of measuring the length of (or angle between) [[covector]] fields; that is, fields of [[linear functional]]s.

To see this, suppose that {{mvar|α}} is a covector field. To wit, for each point {{mvar|p}}, {{mvar|α}} determines a function {{math|''α''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} defined on tangent vectors at {{mvar|p}} so that the following [[linear transformation|linearity]] condition holds for all tangent vectors {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and all real numbers {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha_p \left(aX_p + bY_p\right) = a\alpha_p \left(X_p\right) + b\alpha_p \left(Y_p\right)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

As {{mvar|p}} varies, {{mvar|α}} is assumed to be a [[smooth function]] in the sense that

:&lt;math&gt;p \mapsto \alpha_p \left(X_p\right)&lt;/math&gt;

is a smooth function of {{mvar|p}} for any smooth vector field {{mvar|X}}.

Any covector field {{mvar|α}} has components in the basis of vector fields {{math|'''f'''}}. These are determined by

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha_i = \alpha \left(X_i\right)\,,\quad i = 1, 2, \dots, n\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Denote the [[row vector]] of these components by

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha[\mathbf{f}] = \big\lbrack\begin{array}{cccc} \alpha_1 &amp; \alpha_2 &amp; \dots &amp; \alpha_n \end{array}\big\rbrack \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Under a change of {{math|'''f'''}} by a matrix {{mvar|A}}, {{math|''α''['''f''']}} changes by the rule

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha[\mathbf{f}A] = \alpha[\mathbf{f}]A \,.&lt;/math&gt;

That is, the row vector of components {{math|''α''['''f''']}} transforms as a ''covariant'' vector.

For a pair {{mvar|α}} and {{mvar|β}} of covector fields, define the inverse metric applied to these two covectors by

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\tilde{g}(\alpha,\beta) = \alpha[\mathbf{f}]G[\mathbf{f}]^{-1}\beta[\mathbf{f}]^\mathsf{T}.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|6}}}}

The resulting definition, although it involves the choice of basis {{math|'''f'''}}, does not actually depend on {{math|'''f'''}} in an essential way. Indeed, changing basis to {{math|'''f'''''A''}} gives

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
      &amp;\alpha[\mathbf{f}A] G[\mathbf{f}A]^{-1} \beta[\mathbf{f}A]^\mathsf{T} \\
  ={} &amp;\left(\alpha[\mathbf{f}]A\right) \left(A^{-1}G[\mathbf{f}]^{-1} \left(A^{-1}\right)^\mathsf{T}\right) \left(A^\mathsf{T}\beta[\mathbf{f}]^\mathsf{T}\right) \\
  ={} &amp;\alpha[\mathbf{f}] G[\mathbf{f}]^{-1} \beta[\mathbf{f}]^\mathsf{T}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

So that the right-hand side of equation ({{EquationNote|6}}) is unaffected by changing the basis {{math|'''f'''}} to any other basis {{math|'''f'''''A''}} whatsoever. Consequently, the equation may be assigned a meaning independently of the choice of basis. The entries of the matrix {{math|''G''['''f''']}} are denoted by {{math|''g''&lt;sup&gt;''ij''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, where the indices {{mvar|i}} and {{mvar|j}} have been raised to indicate the transformation law ({{EquationNote|5}}).

===Raising and lowering indices===
{{See also|Raising and lowering indices}}
In a basis of vector fields {{math|'''f''' {{=}} (''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, any smooth tangent vector field {{mvar|X}} can be written in the form

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;X =
  v^1[\mathbf{f}]X_1 + v^2 [\mathbf{f}]X_2 + \dots + v^n[\mathbf{f}]X_n =
  \mathbf{f} \begin{bmatrix}v^1[\mathbf{f}] \\ v^2[\mathbf{f}] \\ \vdots \\ v^n[\mathbf{f}]\end{bmatrix} =
  \mathbf{f} v[\mathbf{f}]
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|7}}}}

for some uniquely determined smooth functions {{math|''v''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ..., ''v''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Upon changing the basis {{math|'''f'''}} by a nonsingular matrix {{mvar|A}}, the coefficients {{math|''v''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;}} change in such a way that equation ({{EquationNote|7}}) remains true. That is,

:&lt;math&gt;X = \mathbf{fA}v[\mathbf{fA}] = \mathbf{f}v[\mathbf{f}]\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Consequently, {{math|''v''['''f'''''A''] {{=}} ''A''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''v''['''f''']}}. In other words, the components of a vector transform ''contravariantly'' (with respect to the inverse) under a change of basis by the nonsingular matrix {{mvar|A}}. The contravariance of the components of {{math|''v''['''f''']}} is notationally designated by placing the indices of {{math|''v''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;['''f''']}} in the upper position.

A frame also allows covectors to be expressed in terms of their components. For the basis of vector fields {{math|'''f''' {{=}} (''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} define the [[dual basis]] to be the [[linear functional]]s {{math|(''θ''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;['''f'''], ..., ''θ''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;['''f'''])}} such that

:&lt;math&gt;\theta^i[\mathbf{f}](X_j) = \begin{cases} 1 &amp; \mathrm{if}\ i=j\\ 0&amp;\mathrm{if}\ i\not=j.\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

That is, {{math|''θ''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;['''f'''](''X''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;) {{=}} ''δ''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, the [[Kronecker delta]]. Let

:&lt;math&gt;\theta[\mathbf{f}] = \begin{bmatrix}\theta^1[\mathbf{f}] \\ \theta^2[\mathbf{f}] \\ \vdots \\ \theta^n[\mathbf{f}]\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

Under a change of basis {{math|'''f''' ↦ '''f'''''A''}} for a nonsingular matrix {{math|''A''}}, {{math|''θ''['''f''']}} transforms via

:&lt;math&gt;\theta[\mathbf{f}A] = A^{-1}\theta[\mathbf{f}].&lt;/math&gt;

Any linear functional {{mvar|α}} on tangent vectors can be expanded in terms of the dual basis {{mvar|θ}}

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \alpha &amp;= a_1[\mathbf{f}] \theta^1[\mathbf{f}] + a_2[\mathbf{f}] \theta^2[\mathbf{f}] + \cdots + a_n[\mathbf{f}] \theta^n[\mathbf{f}] \\[8pt]
         &amp;= \big\lbrack\begin{array}{cccc}a_1[\mathbf{f}] &amp; a_2[\mathbf{f}] &amp; \dots &amp; a_n[\mathbf{f}]\end{array}\big\rbrack \theta[\mathbf{f}] \\[8pt]
         &amp;= a[\mathbf{f}] \theta[\mathbf{f}]
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|8}}}}

where {{math|''a''['''f''']}} denotes the [[row vector]] {{math|[ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;['''f'''] ... ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;['''f'''] ]}}. The components {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} transform when the basis {{math|'''f'''}} is replaced by {{math|'''f'''''A''}} in such a way that equation ({{EquationNote|8}}) continues to hold. That is,

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = a[\mathbf{f}A]\theta[\mathbf{f}A] = a[\mathbf{f}]\theta[\mathbf{f}]&lt;/math&gt;

whence, because {{math|''θ''['''f'''''A''] {{=}} ''A''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''θ''['''f''']}}, it follows that {{math|1=''a''['''f'''''A''] {{=}} ''a''['''f''']''A''}}. That is, the components {{mvar|a}} transform ''covariantly'' (by the matrix {{mvar|A}} rather than its inverse). The covariance of the components of {{math|''a''['''f''']}} is notationally designated by placing the indices of {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;['''f''']}} in the lower position.

Now, the metric tensor gives a means to identify vectors and covectors as follows. Holding {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} fixed, the function

:&lt;math&gt;g_p(X_p, -) : Y_p \mapsto g_p(X_p, Y_p)&lt;/math&gt;

of tangent vector {{math|''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} defines a [[linear functional]] on the tangent space at {{mvar|p}}. This operation takes a vector {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} at a point {{mvar|p}} and produces a covector {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;, −)}}. In a basis of vector fields {{math|'''f'''}}, if a vector field {{mvar|X}} has components {{math|''v''['''f''']}}, then the components of the covector field {{math|''g''(''X'', −)}} in the dual basis are given by the entries of the row vector
:&lt;math&gt;a[\mathbf{f}] = v[\mathbf{f}]^\mathsf{T} G[\mathbf{f}].&lt;/math&gt;

Under a change of basis {{math|'''f''' ↦ '''f'''''A''}}, the right-hand side of this equation transforms via
:&lt;math&gt;
  v[\mathbf{f}A]^\mathsf{T} G[\mathbf{f}A] =
    v[\mathbf{f}]^\mathsf{T} \left(A^{-1}\right)^\mathsf{T} A^\mathsf{T} G[\mathbf{f}]A =
    v[\mathbf{f}]^\mathsf{T} G[\mathbf{f}]A
&lt;/math&gt;

so that {{math|''a''['''f'''''A''] {{=}} ''a''['''f''']''A''}}: {{mvar|a}} transforms covariantly. The operation of associating to the (contravariant) components of a vector field {{math|''v''['''f'''] {{=}} [ ''v''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;['''f'''] ''v''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;['''f'''] ... ''v''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;['''f'''] ]}}&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; the (covariant) components of the covector field {{math|''a''['''f'''] {{=}} [ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;['''f'''] ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;['''f'''] … ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;['''f'''] ]}}, where
:&lt;math&gt;a_i[\mathbf{f}] = \sum_{k=1}^n v^k[\mathbf{f}]g_{ki}[\mathbf{f}]&lt;/math&gt;

is called '''lowering the index'''.

To ''raise the index'', one applies the same construction but with the inverse metric instead of the metric. If {{math|''a''['''f'''] {{=}} [ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;['''f'''] ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;['''f'''] ... ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;['''f'''] ]}} are the components of a covector in the dual basis {{math|''θ''['''f''']}}, then the column vector
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;v[\mathbf{f}] = G^{-1}[\mathbf{f}]a[\mathbf{f}]^\mathsf{T}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|9}}}}
has components which transform contravariantly:
:&lt;math&gt;v[\mathbf{f}A] = A^{-1}v[\mathbf{f}].&lt;/math&gt;

Consequently, the quantity {{math|''X'' {{=}} '''f'''''v''['''f''']}} does not depend on the choice of basis {{math|'''f'''}} in an essential way, and thus defines a vector field on {{mvar|M}}. The operation ({{EquationNote|9}}) associating to the (covariant) components of a covector {{math|''a''['''f''']}} the (contravariant) components of a vector {{math|''v''['''f''']}} given is called '''raising the index'''. In components, ({{EquationNote|9}}) is
:&lt;math&gt;v^i[\mathbf{f}] = \sum_{k=1}^n g^{ik}[\mathbf{f}] a_k[\mathbf{f}].&lt;/math&gt;

===Induced metric===
&lt;!--{{main|Induced metric}} Not currently well-written. --&gt;
Let {{mvar|U}} be an [[open set]] in {{math|'''ℝ'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and let {{mvar|φ}} be a [[continuously differentiable]] function from {{mvar|U}} into the [[Euclidean space]] {{math|'''ℝ'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, where {{math|''m'' &gt; ''n''}}. The mapping {{mvar|φ}} is called an [[immersion (mathematics)|immersion]] if its differential is [[injective]] at every point of {{mvar|U}}. The image of {{mvar|φ}} is called an [[immersed submanifold]].

Suppose that {{mvar|φ}} is an immersion onto the submanifold {{math|''M'' ⊂ '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The usual Euclidean [[dot product]] in {{math|'''ℝ'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is a metric which, when restricted to vectors tangent to {{mvar|M}}, gives a means for taking the dot product of these tangent vectors. This is called the '''induced metric'''.

Suppose that {{mvar|v}} is a tangent vector at a point of {{mvar|U}}, say
:&lt;math&gt;v = v^1\mathbf{e}_1 + \dots + v^n\mathbf{e}_n&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are the standard coordinate vectors in {{math|'''ℝ'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. When {{mvar|φ}} is applied to {{mvar|U}}, the vector {{mvar|v}} goes over to the vector tangent to {{mvar|M}} given by
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi_*(v) = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{a=1}^m v^i\frac{\partial \varphi^a}{\partial x^i}\mathbf{e}_a\,.&lt;/math&gt;

(This is called the [[pushforward (differential)|pushforward]] of {{mvar|v}} along {{mvar|φ}}.) Given two such vectors, {{mvar|v}} and {{mvar|w}}, the induced metric is defined by
:&lt;math&gt;g(v,w) = \varphi_*(v)\cdot \varphi_*(w).&lt;/math&gt;

It follows from a straightforward calculation that the matrix of the induced metric in the basis of coordinate vector fields {{math|'''e'''}} is given by
:&lt;math&gt;G(\mathbf{e}) = (D\varphi)^\mathsf{T}(D\varphi)&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|Dφ}} is the Jacobian matrix:
:&lt;math&gt;D\varphi = \begin{bmatrix}
  \frac{\partial\varphi^1}{\partial x^1} &amp; \frac{\partial\varphi^1}{\partial x^2} &amp;
    \dots  &amp; \frac{\partial\varphi^1}{\partial x^n} \\[1ex]
  \frac{\partial\varphi^2}{\partial x^1} &amp; \frac{\partial\varphi^2}{\partial x^2} &amp;
    \dots  &amp; \frac{\partial\varphi^2}{\partial x^n} \\
  \vdots                                 &amp; \vdots                                 &amp;
    \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
  \frac{\partial\varphi^m}{\partial x^1} &amp; \frac{\partial\varphi^m}{\partial x^2} &amp;
    \dots  &amp; \frac{\partial\varphi^m}{\partial x^n}
\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Intrinsic definitions of a metric==
The notion of a metric can be defined intrinsically using the language of [[fiber bundle]]s and [[vector bundle]]s. In these terms, a '''metric tensor''' is a function

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;g : \mathrm{T}M\times_M \mathrm{T}M\to \mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|10}}}}

from the [[fiber product]] of the [[tangent bundle]] of {{mvar|M}} with itself to {{math|'''R'''}} such that the restriction of {{mvar|g}} to each fiber is a nondegenerate bilinear mapping

:&lt;math&gt;g_p : \mathrm{T}_pM\times \mathrm{T}_pM \to \mathbf{R}.&lt;/math&gt;

The mapping ({{EquationNote|10}}) is required to be [[continuous function|continuous]], and often [[continuously differentiable]], [[smooth function|smooth]], or [[real analytic]], depending on the case of interest, and whether {{mvar|M}} can support such a structure.

===Metric as a section of a bundle===
By the [[Tensor product#Universal property|universal property of the tensor product]], any bilinear mapping ({{EquationNote|10}}) gives rise [[natural transformation|naturally]] to a [[section (fiber bundle)|section]] {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;⊗&lt;/sub&gt;}} of the [[dual space|dual]] of the [[tensor product bundle]] of {{math|T''M''}} with itself

:&lt;math&gt;g_\otimes \in \Gamma\left((\mathrm{T}M \otimes \mathrm{T}M)^*\right).&lt;/math&gt;

The section {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;⊗&lt;/sub&gt;}} is defined on simple elements of {{math|T''M'' ⊗ T''M''}} by

:&lt;math&gt;g_\otimes(v \otimes w) = g(v, w)&lt;/math&gt;

and is defined on arbitrary elements of {{math|T''M'' ⊗ T''M''}} by extending linearly to linear combinations of simple elements. The original bilinear form {{mvar|g}} is symmetric if and only if
:&lt;math&gt;g_\otimes \circ \tau = g_\otimes&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\tau : \mathrm{T}M \otimes \mathrm{T}M \stackrel{\cong}{\to} TM \otimes TM&lt;/math&gt;
is the [[tensor product#Tensor powers and braiding|braiding map]].

Since {{mvar|M}} is finite-dimensional, there is a [[natural isomorphism]]

:&lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{T}M \otimes \mathrm{T}M)^* \cong \mathrm{T}^*M \otimes \mathrm{T}^*M,&lt;/math&gt;

so that {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;⊗&lt;/sub&gt;}} is regarded also as a section of the bundle {{math|T*''M'' ⊗ T*''M''}} of the [[cotangent bundle]] {{math|T*''M''}} with itself. Since {{mvar|g}} is symmetric as a bilinear mapping, it follows that {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;⊗&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a [[symmetric tensor]].

===Metric in a vector bundle===
More generally, one may speak of a metric in a [[vector bundle]]. If {{mvar|E}} is a vector bundle over a manifold {{mvar|M}}, then a metric is a mapping

:&lt;math&gt;g : E\times_M E\to \mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt;

from the [[fiber product]] of {{mvar|E}} to {{math|'''R'''}} which is bilinear in each fiber:

:&lt;math&gt;g_p : E_p \times E_p\to \mathbf{R}.&lt;/math&gt;

Using duality as above, a metric is often identified with a [[section (fiber bundle)|section]] of the [[tensor product]] bundle {{math|''E''* ⊗ ''E''*}}. (See [[metric (vector bundle)]].)

===Tangent–cotangent isomorphism===
{{see also|Musical isomorphism}}
The metric tensor gives a [[natural isomorphism]] from the [[tangent bundle]] to the [[cotangent bundle]], sometimes called the [[musical isomorphism]].&lt;ref&gt;For the terminology "musical isomorphism", see {{harvtxt|Gallot|Hulin|Lafontaine|2004|p=75}}. See also {{harvtxt|Lee|1997|pp=27–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; This isomorphism is obtained by setting, for each tangent vector {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ T&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;''M''}},

:&lt;math&gt;S_gX_p\, \stackrel\text{def}{=}\, g(X_p, -),&lt;/math&gt;

the [[linear functional]] on {{math|T&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;''M''}} which sends a tangent vector {{math|''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} at {{mvar|p}} to {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;,''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}. That is, in terms of the pairing {{math|[−, −]}} between {{math|T&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;''M''}} and its [[dual space]] {{math|T{{su|b=''p''|p=∗}}''M''}},

:&lt;math&gt;[S_gX_p, Y_p] = g_p(X_p, Y_p)&lt;/math&gt;

for all tangent vectors {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. The mapping {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a [[linear transformation]] from {{math|T&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;''M''}} to {{math|T{{su|b=''p''|p=∗}}''M''}}. It follows from the definition of non-degeneracy that the [[kernel (set theory)|kernel]] of {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is reduced to zero, and so by the [[rank–nullity theorem]], {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a [[linear isomorphism]]. Furthermore, {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a [[symmetric linear transformation]] in the sense that

:&lt;math&gt;[S_gX_p, Y_p] = [S_gY_p, X_p] &lt;/math&gt;

for all tangent vectors {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

Conversely, any linear isomorphism {{math|''S'' : T&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;''M'' → T{{su|b=''p''|p=∗}}''M''}} defines a non-degenerate bilinear form on {{math|T&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;''M''}} by means of

:&lt;math&gt;g_S(X_p, Y_p) = [SX_p, Y_p]\,.&lt;/math&gt;

This bilinear form is symmetric if and only if {{mvar|S}} is symmetric. There is thus a natural one-to-one correspondence between symmetric bilinear forms on {{math|T&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;''M''}} and symmetric linear isomorphisms of {{math|T&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;''M''}} to the dual {{math|T{{su|b=''p''|p=∗}}''M''}}.

As {{mvar|p}} varies over {{mvar|M}}, {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt;}} defines a section of the bundle {{math|Hom(T''M'', T*''M'')}} of [[vector bundle morphism|vector bundle isomorphisms]] of the tangent bundle to the cotangent bundle. This section has the same smoothness as {{mvar|g}}: it is continuous, differentiable, smooth, or real-analytic according as {{mvar|g}}. The mapping {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, which associates to every vector field on {{mvar|M}} a covector field on {{mvar|M}} gives an abstract formulation of "lowering the index" on a vector field. The inverse of {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a mapping {{math|T*''M'' → T''M''}} which, analogously, gives an abstract formulation of "raising the index" on a covector field.

The inverse {{math|''S''{{su|b=''g''|p=−1}}}} defines a linear mapping
:&lt;math&gt;S_g^{-1} : \mathrm{T}^*M \to \mathrm{T}M&lt;/math&gt;

which is nonsingular and symmetric in the sense that
:&lt;math&gt;\left[S_g^{-1}\alpha, \beta\right] = \left[S_g^{-1}\beta, \alpha\right]&lt;/math&gt;

for all covectors {{mvar|α}}, {{mvar|β}}. Such a nonsingular symmetric mapping gives rise (by the [[tensor-hom adjunction]]) to a map
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{T}^*M \otimes \mathrm{T}^*M \to \mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt;

or by the [[Double dual|double dual isomorphism]] to a section of the tensor product
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{T}M \otimes \mathrm{T}M.&lt;/math&gt;

==Arclength and the line element==
Suppose that {{mvar|g}} is a Riemannian metric on {{mvar|M}}. In a local coordinate system {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, {{math|''i'' {{=}} 1, 2, …, ''n''}}, the metric tensor appears as a [[matrix (math)|matrix]], denoted here by {{math|'''G'''}}, whose entries are the components {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;}} of the metric tensor relative to the coordinate vector fields.

Let {{math|''γ''(''t'')}} be a piecewise-differentiable [[parametric curve]] in {{mvar|M}}, for {{math|''a'' ≤ ''t'' ≤ ''b''}}. The [[arclength]] of the curve is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;L = \int_a^b \sqrt{ \sum_{i,j=1}^n g_{ij}(\gamma(t)) \left(\frac{d}{dt}x^i \circ \gamma(t)\right) \left(\frac{d}{dt} x^j \circ \gamma(t)\right)}\,dt \,.&lt;/math&gt;

In connection with this geometrical application, the [[quadratic form|quadratic]] [[differential form]]

:&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = \sum_{i,j=1}^n g_{ij}(p) dx^i dx^j&lt;/math&gt;

is called the [[first fundamental form]] associated to the metric, while {{mvar|ds}} is the [[line element]]. When {{math|''ds''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} is [[pullback (differential geometry)|pulled back]] to the image of a curve in {{mvar|M}}, it represents the square of the differential with respect to arclength.

For a pseudo-Riemannian metric, the length formula above is not always defined, because the term under the square root may become negative. We generally only define the length of a curve when the quantity under the square root is always of one sign or the other. In this case, define

:&lt;math&gt;L = \int_a^b \sqrt{ \left|\sum_{i,j=1}^ng_{ij}(\gamma(t)) \left(\frac{d}{dt}x^i \circ \gamma(t)\right)\left(\frac{d}{dt}x^j \circ \gamma(t)\right)\right|}\,dt \, .&lt;/math&gt;

Note that, while these formulas use coordinate expressions, they are in fact independent of the coordinates chosen; they depend only on the metric, and the curve along which the formula is integrated.

===The energy, variational principles and geodesics===
Given a segment of a curve, another frequently defined quantity is the (kinetic) '''energy''' of the curve:

:&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{1}{2} \int_a^b \sum_{i,j=1}^ng_{ij}(\gamma(t)) \left(\frac{d}{dt}x^i \circ \gamma(t)\right)\left(\frac{d}{dt}x^j \circ \gamma(t)\right)\,dt \,. &lt;/math&gt;

This usage comes from [[physics]], specifically, [[classical mechanics]], where the integral {{mvar|E}} can be seen to directly correspond to the [[kinetic energy]] of a point particle moving on the surface of a manifold. Thus, for example, in Jacobi's formulation of [[Maupertuis' principle]], the metric tensor can be seen to correspond to the mass tensor of a moving particle.

In many cases, whenever a calculation calls for the length to be used, a similar calculation using the energy may be done as well. This often leads to simpler formulas by avoiding the need for the square-root. Thus, for example, the [[geodesic equation]]s may be obtained by applying [[variational principle]]s to either the length or the energy. In the latter case, the geodesic equations are seen to arise from the [[principle of least action]]: they describe the motion of a "free particle" (a particle feeling no forces) that is confined to move on the manifold, but otherwise moves freely, with constant momentum, within the manifold.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sternberg|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canonical measure and volume form==
In analogy with the case of surfaces, a metric tensor on an {{mvar|n}}-dimensional paracompact manifold {{mvar|M}} gives rise to a natural way to measure the {{mvar|n}}-dimensional [[volume]] of subsets of the manifold. The resulting natural positive [[Borel measure]] allows one to develop a theory of integrating functions on the manifold by means of the associated [[Lebesgue integral]].

A measure can be defined, by the [[Riesz representation theorem]], by giving a positive [[linear functional]] {{mvar|Λ}} on the space {{math|''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''M'')}} of [[compact support|compactly supported]] [[continuous function]]s on {{mvar|M}}. More precisely, if {{mvar|M}} is a manifold with a (pseudo-)Riemannian metric tensor {{mvar|g}}, then there is a unique positive [[Borel measure]] {{math|''μ''&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt;}} such that for any [[coordinate chart]] {{math|(''U'', ''φ'')}},
:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda f = \int_U f\,d\mu_g = \int_{\varphi(U)} f\circ\varphi^{-1}(x) \sqrt{|\det g|}\,dx&lt;/math&gt;
for all {{mvar|f}} supported in {{mvar|U}}. Here {{math|det ''g''}} is the [[determinant]] of the matrix formed by the components of the metric tensor in the coordinate chart. That {{mvar|Λ}} is well-defined on functions supported in coordinate neighborhoods is justified by [[integration by substitution|Jacobian change of variables]]. It extends to a unique positive linear functional on {{math|''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''M'')}} by means of a [[partition of unity]].

If {{mvar|M}} is in addition [[orientation (mathematics)|oriented]], then it is possible to define a natural [[volume form]] from the metric tensor. In a [[right-handed coordinate system|positively oriented coordinate system]] {{math|(''x''&lt;sup&gt;''1''&lt;/sup&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;)}} the volume form is represented as
:&lt;math&gt;\omega = \sqrt{|\det g|}\, dx^1\wedge\cdots\wedge dx^n&lt;/math&gt;
where the {{math|''dx''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;}} are the [[coordinate differential]]s and {{math|∧}} denotes the [[exterior product]] in the algebra of [[differential form]]s. The volume form also gives a way to integrate functions on the manifold, and this geometric integral agrees with the integral obtained by the canonical Borel measure.

==Examples==

===Euclidean metric===
The most familiar example is that of elementary [[Euclidean geometry]]: the two-dimensional [[Euclidean distance|Euclidean]] metric tensor. In the usual {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}} coordinates, we can write

:&lt;math&gt;g = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1\end{bmatrix} \,. &lt;/math&gt;

The length of a curve reduces to the formula:

:&lt;math&gt;L = \int_a^b \sqrt{ (dx)^2 + (dy)^2} \,. &lt;/math&gt;

The Euclidean metric in some other common coordinate systems can be written as follows.

[[Polar coordinates]] {{math|(''r'', ''θ'')}}:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  x &amp;= r \cos\theta \\
  y &amp;= r \sin\theta \\
  J &amp;= \begin{bmatrix}\cos\theta &amp; -r\sin\theta \\ \sin\theta &amp; r\cos\theta\end{bmatrix} \,.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

So
:&lt;math&gt;g = J^\mathsf{T}J =
  \begin{bmatrix}
      \cos^2\theta + \sin^2\theta                  &amp; -r\sin\theta \cos\theta + r\sin\theta\cos\theta \\
    -r\cos\theta\sin\theta + r\cos\theta\sin\theta &amp; r^2 \sin^2\theta + r^2\cos^2\theta
  \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
    1 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp; r^2
  \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
by [[trigonometric identity|trigonometric identities]].

In general, in a [[Cartesian coordinate system]] {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;}} on a [[Euclidean space]], the partial derivatives {{math|∂ / ∂''x&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;''}} are [[orthonormal]] with respect to the Euclidean metric. Thus the metric tensor is the [[Kronecker delta]] δ&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; in this coordinate system. The metric tensor with respect to arbitrary (possibly curvilinear) coordinates {{math|''q&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;''}} is given by
:&lt;math&gt;g_{ij} =
  \sum_{kl}\delta_{kl}\frac{\partial x^k}{\partial q^i} \frac{\partial x^l}{\partial q^j} =
  \sum_k\frac{\partial x^k}{\partial q^i}\frac{\partial x^k}{\partial q^j}.
&lt;/math&gt;

====The round metric on a sphere====
The unit sphere in {{math|'''ℝ'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} comes equipped with a natural metric induced from the ambient Euclidean metric. In standard spherical coordinates {{math|(''θ'', ''φ'')}}, with {{math|''θ''}} the [[colatitude]], the angle measured from the {{mvar|z}}-axis, and {{mvar|φ}} the angle from the {{mvar|x}}-axis in the {{mvar|xy}}-plane, the metric takes the form

:&lt;math&gt;g = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; \sin^2 \theta\end{bmatrix} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

This is usually written in the form

:&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta\,d\varphi^2\,.&lt;/math&gt;

===Lorentzian metrics from relativity===
{{main|Metric tensor (general relativity)}}
In flat [[Minkowski space]] ([[special relativity]]), with coordinates
:&lt;math&gt;r^\mu \rightarrow \left(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3\right) = (ct, x, y, z) \, ,&lt;/math&gt;

the metric is, depending on choice of [[metric signature]],
:&lt;math&gt;g = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 \end{bmatrix} \quad \text{or} \quad g = \begin{bmatrix} -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix} \,. &lt;/math&gt;

For a curve with—for example—constant time coordinate, the length formula with this metric reduces to the usual length formula. For a [[Spacetime interval|timelike]] curve, the length formula gives the [[proper time]] along the curve.

In this case, the [[spacetime interval]] is written as
:&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = c^2 dt^2 - dx^2 - dy^2 - dz^2 = dr^\mu dr_\mu = g_{\mu \nu} dr^\mu dr^\nu\,. &lt;/math&gt;

The [[Schwarzschild metric]] describes the spacetime around a spherically symmetric body, such as a planet, or a [[black hole]]. With coordinates
:&lt;math&gt;\left(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3\right) = (ct, r, \theta, \varphi) \,,&lt;/math&gt;

we can write the metric as
:&lt;math&gt;g_{\mu\nu} =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \left(1 - \frac{2GM}{rc^2}\right) &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp; -\left(1 - \frac{2GM}{r c^2}\right)^{-1} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; -r^2 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -r^2 \sin^2 \theta
  \end{bmatrix}\,,
&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|G}} (inside the matrix) is the [[gravitational constant]] and {{mvar|M}} represents the total [[mass-energy]] content of the central object.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4420">The '''Minkowski [[content (measure theory)|content]]''' (named after [[Hermann Minkowski]]), or the '''boundary measure''', of a set is a basic concept that uses concepts from [[geometry]] and [[measure theory]] to generalize the notions of [[arc length|length]] of a [[smooth curve]] in the plane, and [[surface area|area]] of a smooth surface in [[euclidean space|space]], to arbitrary [[measurable set]]s. 

It is typically applied to [[fractal]] boundaries of domains in the [[Euclidean space]], but it can also be used in the context of general metric [[Measure space|measure spaces.]]

It is related to, although different from, the [[Hausdorff measure]].
&lt;!--== Definition ==
Let &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle(X,\, \mu,\, d)&lt;/math&gt; be a metric measure space, where ''d'' is a [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] on ''X'' and &amp;mu; is a [[Borel measure]]. For a subset ''A'' of ''X'' and real &amp;epsilon; &gt; 0, let

: &lt;math&gt;A_\varepsilon = \{ x \in X \, | \, d(x, A) \leq \varepsilon \}&lt;/math&gt;

be the &amp;epsilon;-''extension'' of ''A''. The '''lower Minkowski content''' of ''A'' is given by

:&lt;math&gt;M_*(A) = \liminf_{\varepsilon \to 0} \frac{\mu(A_\varepsilon) - \mu(A)}{\varepsilon},&lt;/math&gt;

and the '''upper Minkowski content''' of ''A'' is

:&lt;math&gt;M^*(A) = \limsup_{\varepsilon \to 0} \frac{\mu(A_\varepsilon) - \mu(A)}{\varepsilon}.&lt;/math&gt;

If ''M''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;(''A'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''M''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;(''A''), then the common value is called the '''Minkowski content''' of ''A'' associated with the measure &amp;mu;, and is denoted by ''M''(''A'').--&gt;
&lt;!-- old section header being replaced with Definition, as original section commented above is not in either source.... == Minkowski content in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; ==--&gt;
==Definition==
For &lt;math&gt; A \subset \mathbb{R}^{n}&lt;/math&gt;, and each integer ''m'' with &lt;math&gt; 0 \leq m \leq n&lt;/math&gt;, the '''''m''-dimensional upper Minkowski content''' is

:&lt;math&gt;M^{*m}(A) = \limsup_{r \to 0^+} \frac{\mu(\{x: d(x,A) &lt; r\})}{\alpha (n-m)r^{n-m}}&lt;/math&gt;

and the '''''m''-dimensional lower Minkowski content''' is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;M_*^m(A) = \liminf_{r \to 0^+} \frac{\mu(\{x: d(x,A) &lt; r\})}{\alpha (n-m)r^{n-m}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\alpha(n-m)r^{n-m}&lt;/math&gt; is the volume of the [[N-sphere|(''n''&amp;minus;''m'')-ball]] of radius r and &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional [[Lebesgue measure]]. 

If the upper and lower ''m''-dimensional Minkowski content of ''A'' are equal, then their common value is called the Minkowski content ''M''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;(''A'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Federer|1969|loc=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=jld-BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA273 p. 273]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Krantz|1999|loc=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=sADLB3ybGS0C&amp;pg=PA74 p. 74]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Properties ==
* The Minkowski content is (generally) not a measure.  In particular, the ''m''-dimensional Minkowski content in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; is not a measure unless ''m''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, in which case it is the [[counting measure]].  Indeed, clearly the Minkowski content assigns the same value to the set ''A'' as well as its [[closure (topology)|closure]].
* If ''A'' is a closed ''m''-[[rectifiable set]] in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, given as the image of a bounded set from '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; under a [[Lipschitz function]], then the ''m''-dimensional Minkowski content of ''A'' exists, and is equal to the ''m''-dimensional [[Hausdorff measure]] of ''A'', apart from a constant normalization depending on the dimension.

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Nelli Neumann was born in [[Wrocław|Breslau]], [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], the only child of [[Jew]]ish parents Max Neumann, a judicial officer, and Sophie Neumann, who died when Nelli was two years old.{{r|jewishwomen}} After ten years in the private ''Höhere Töchterschule'' in Breslau, Neumann attended girls' grammar courses and graduated at a boys' school (''König-Wilhelm-Gymnasium'') in 1905. Her father promoted her mathematical talent by arranging private mathematics lessons given by [[Richard Courant]]. The two went on to study together at the [[University of Wrocław|University of Breslau]] and [[University of Zürich]]. Neumann would return to Breslau for her doctorate, for which she completed her thesis in 1909 under the supervision of [[Friedrich Otto Rudolf Sturm|Rudolf Sturm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nelly Neumann|url=https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=54624|website=Mathematics Genealogy Project|access-date=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Courant received his post-doctoral degree at Göttingen University, they married in the summer of 1912.

Turning down a post-doctoral position at the University of Breslau, Neumann then took courses that qualified her to become a secondary school teacher. On February 16, 1916, she and Courant divorced. After the First World War she taught at a girls' school in [[Essen]], but lost her position when the [[Nazi]]s took power in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Richer Picture of Mathematics: The Göttingen Tradition and Beyond|first=David E.|last=Rowe|author-link=David E.

[[File:North Magnetic Poles.svg|thumb|Location of the North Magnetic Pole and the North Geomagnetic Pole in 2017.]]
The '''North Magnetic Pole''' is the wandering point on the surface of [[Earth]]'s [[Northern Hemisphere]] at which the [[Earth's magnetic field|planet's magnetic field]] points vertically downwards (in other words, if a magnetic compass needle is allowed to rotate about a horizontal axis, it will point straight down). There is only one location where this occurs, near (but distinct from) the [[Geographic North Pole]] and the [[Geomagnetic North Pole]].

The North Magnetic Pole moves over time due to magnetic changes in the [[Outer core|Earth's core]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Merrill|first= Ronald T.|last2=McElhinny|first2=Michael W.|last3=McFadden|first3=Phillip L.|title=The magnetic field of the earth: paleomagnetism, the core, and the deep mantle|publisher=[[Academic Press]]|year=1996|isbn=978-0-12-491246-5|chapter=Chapter 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, it was determined by the [[Geological Survey of Canada]] to lie west of [[Ellesmere Island]] in [[northern Canada]] at {{Coord|81.3|N|110.8|W|name=Magnetic North Pole 2001}}. It was situated at {{Coord|83.1|N|117.8|W|name=Magnetic North Pole 2005 est}} in 2005. In 2009, while still situated within the Canadian Arctic territorial claim at {{Coord|84.9|N|131.0|W|name=Magnetic North Pole 2009}},&lt;ref name="WDCG-Kyoto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wdc.kugi.kyoto-u.ac.jp/poles/polesexp.html|title=Magnetic North, Geomagnetic and Magnetic Poles|author=World Data Center for Geomagnetism, Kyoto|accessdate=2012-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was moving toward [[Russia]] at between {{Convert|34|and|37|mi|km|order=flip}} per year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/12/091224-north-pole-magnetic-russia-earth-core.html North Magnetic Pole Moving East Due to Core Flux], National Geographic, December 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, the pole is projected to have moved beyond the Canadian Arctic territorial claim to {{Coord|86.5|N|172.6|W|name=Magnetic North Pole 2017 est}}.&lt;ref name="WDCG-Kyoto"/&gt;

Its southern hemisphere counterpart is the [[South Magnetic Pole]]. Since the Earth's magnetic field is not exactly symmetrical, the North and South Magnetic Poles are not [[antipodes|antipodal]], meaning that a straight line drawn from one to the other does not pass through the geometric centre of the Earth.

The Earth's North and South Magnetic Poles are also known as '''Magnetic Dip Poles''', with reference to the vertical "dip" of the magnetic field lines at those points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deeptow.whoi.edu/northpole.html|title=The Magnetic North Pole|last=|first=|date=|publisher=Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution|work=Ocean bottom magnetology laboratory|accessdate=2017-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Polarity==
&lt;!-- The "North Pole" of a magnet is the pole that points north. Therefore, the Earth's "North Magnetic Pole" is physically a magnetic SOUTH pole. These claims are supported by the references given. PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE THIS TO SAY SOMETHING ELSE WITHOUT VERY GOOD EVIDENCE. --&gt;
{{See also|Magnet#Pole naming conventions}}

All [[magnet]]s have two poles, where the lines of [[magnetic flux]] enter and emerge. By analogy with the Earth's magnetic field, these are called the magnet's "north" and "south" poles. The convention in early [[compass]]es was to call the end of the needle pointing to the Earth's North Magnetic Pole the "north pole" (or "north-seeking pole") and the other end the "south pole" (the names are often abbreviated to "N" and "S"). Because opposite poles attract, this definition means that the Earth's North Magnetic Pole is actually a magnetic ''south'' pole and the Earth's South Magnetic Pole is a magnetic ''north'' pole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The direction of magnetic field lines is defined such that the lines emerge from the magnet's north pole and enter into the magnet's south pole.

Early European navigators believed that compass needles were attracted to a "magnetic island" somewhere in the far north (see [[Rupes Nigra]]), or to the [[Pole Star]].&lt;ref name="NatResCan"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100112152718/http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/geomag/nmp/early_nmp_e.php Early Concept of the North Magnetic Pole], Natural Resources Canada, retrieved June 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that the Earth itself acts as a giant magnet was first proposed in 1600 by the English physician and natural philosopher [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]]. He was also the first to define the North Magnetic Pole as the point where the Earth's magnetic field points vertically downwards. This is the definition used nowadays, though it would be a few hundred years before the nature of the Earth's magnetic field was understood properly.&lt;ref name="NatResCan"/&gt;

==Expeditions and measurements==
{{See also|Arctic exploration|Farthest North|List of Arctic expeditions}}

===Early===
The first expedition to reach the North Magnetic Pole was led by [[James Clark Ross]], who found it at Cape Adelaide on the [[Boothia Peninsula]] on June 1, 1831. [[Roald Amundsen]] found the North Magnetic Pole in a slightly different location in 1903. The third observation was by Canadian government scientists Paul Serson and Jack Clark, of the [[Dominion Astrophysical Observatory]], who found the pole at Allen Lake on [[Prince of Wales Island, Nunavut|Prince of Wales Island]] in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100827062222/http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/geomag/nmp/expeditions_e.php History of Expeditions to the North Magnetic Pole], Natural Resources Canada&lt;/ref&gt;

===Project Polaris===
At the start of the [[Cold War]], the [[United States Department of War]] recognized a need for a comprehensive survey of the [[North America]]n [[Arctic]] and asked the [[United States Army]] to undertake the task. An assignment was made in 1946 for the newly formed Army’s Air Corps [[Strategic Air Command]] to explore the entire Arctic Ocean area. The exploration was conducted by the [[46th Reconnaissance Squadron|46th (later re-designated the 72nd) Photo Reconnaissance Squadron]] and reported on as a classified ''Top Secret'' mission named Project Nanook. This project in turn was divided into many separate, but identically classified, projects, one of which was Project Polaris, which was a radar, photographic ([[trimetrogon]], or three-angle, cameras) and visual study of the entire [[Canadian Arctic Archipelago|Canadian Archipelago]]. A Canadian officer observer was assigned to accompany each flight.

Directing Project Polaris was its navigation leader, 1st Lieutenant Frank O. Klein, a World War II combat veteran. Incidental to the project and taken up at his own initiative was a study of northern terrestrial magnetism. The study was prompted by the surprise that the [[fluxgate compass]] did not behave erratically as expected. It oscillated no more than 1 to 2 degrees over much of the region.&lt;ref name=White&gt;{{cite book|last=White |first=Ken|title=World in Peril: The Origin , Mission &amp; Scientific Findings of the 46th / 72nd Reconnaissance Squadron |year=1994|publisher=K.

The centre of the north magnetic dip pole was on [[Prince of Wales Island (Nunavut)|Prince of Wales Island]] some {{convert|250|mi|km|order=flip}} NNW of the positions determined by Amundsen and Ross, and the dip pole occupied a larger elliptical area,{{clarify | reason = Previously the pole has been talked of as a point, and it is unclear how a point can have a 'center' or 'occupy an area'. Is this referring to the elliptical diurnal movement mentioned below?|date=February 2014}} with foci about {{convert|250|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} apart on [[Boothia Peninsula]] and [[Bathurst Island (Nunavut)|Bathurst Island]].

Klein called the two foci local poles, for their importance to navigation in emergencies when using a "homing" procedure.{{clarify | reason = Does 'foci' mean foci of the aforementioned ellipse? Why are the foci important?|date=February 2014}} About 3 months after Klein's findings were officially reported, a Canadian ground expedition was sent into the Archipelago to locate the position of the magnetic pole. R. Glenn Madill, Chief of Terrestrial Magnetism, [[Department of Mines and Resources]], Canada, wrote to Lt. Klein on 21 July 1948:

{{Quote|… we agree on one point and that is the presence of what we can call the main magnetic pole on northwestern Prince of Wales Island. I have accepted as a purely preliminary value the position latitude 73°N and longitude 100°W. Your value of 73°15'N and 99°45’W is in excellent agreement, and I suggest that you use your value by all means.|R. Glenn Madill&lt;ref name=White /&gt;}}
(The positions were less than {{convert|20|mi|km|sigfig=1|order=flip|abbr=on}} apart.)

===Modern (post-1996)===
[[Image:Magnetic North Pole Positions 2015.svg|thumb|right|The movement of Earth's north magnetic pole across the Canadian arctic.]]
[[Image:North Magnetic Pole Speed.svg|thumb|right|Speed of the north magnetic pole according to the IGRF-12 model.]]
The Canadian government has made several measurements since, which show that the North Magnetic Pole is moving continually northwestward. In 2001, an expedition located the pole at {{Coord|81.3|N|110.8|W|name=Magnetic North Pole 2001 location}}.
In 2007, the latest survey found the pole at {{Coord|83.95|N|120.72|W|name=Magnetic North Pole 2007 location}}.&lt;ref name="newitt2007"&gt;L. R. Newitt, A. Chulliat, and J.-J. Orgeval, [http://www.terrapub.co.jp/journals/EPS/pdf/2009/6106/61060703.pdf Location of the North Magnetic Pole in April 2007], Earth Planets Space, 61, 703–710, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
During the 20th century it moved 1100&amp;nbsp;km, and since 1970 its rate of motion has accelerated from 9&amp;nbsp;km/year to approximately 52&amp;nbsp;km/year (2001–2007 average; see also [[Polar drift]]). Members of the 2007 expedition to locate the magnetic north pole wrote that such expeditions have
become logistically difficult, as the pole moves farther away from inhabited locations. They expect that in the future, the magnetic pole position will be obtained from satellite data instead of ground surveys.&lt;ref name="newitt2007"/&gt;

This general movement is in addition to a daily or ''diurnal'' variation in which the North Magnetic Pole describes a rough ellipse, with a maximum deviation of 80&amp;nbsp;km from its mean position.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100625061648/http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/geomag/nmp/daily_mvt_nmp_e.php Geomagnetism — Daily Movement of the North Magnetic Pole], Natural Resources Canada&lt;/ref&gt; This effect is due to disturbances of the geomagnetic field by [[charged particle]]s from the [[Sun]].

The first team of novices to reach the Magnetic North Pole did so in 1996, led by David Hempleman-Adams. It included the first British woman [[Sue Stockdale]] and first Swedish woman to reach the Pole. The team also successfully tracked the location of the Magnetic North Pole on behalf of the University of Ottawa, and certified its location by [[magnetometer]] and [[theodolite]] at {{Coord|78|35.7|N|104|11.9|W|name=Magnetic North Pole 1996}}.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080513074336/http://polarrace.com/gallery/articles/1996_magnetic_north_pole/ 1996 Certified Position of the Magnetic North Pole], Jock Wishart, [[Polar Race]] organiser&lt;/ref&gt;

The biennial [[Polar Race]] takes place between [[Resolute Bay]] in northern Canada and the 1996-certified location of the North Magnetic Pole at {{Coord|78|35.7|N|104|11.9|W|name=Magnetic North Pole 1996}}.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} On 25 July 2007, the ''[[Top Gear (current format)|Top Gear]] [[Top Gear: Polar Special|Polar Challenge Special]]'' was broadcast on [[BBC Two]] in the United Kingdom, in which [[Jeremy Clarkson]] and [[James May]] (and their support and camera team) became the first people in history to reach this location in a car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007v18p |title=Polar Challenge |series=Top Gear |network=BBC Two |airdate= 25 July 2007 |minutes=0:22 |accessdate=19 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Magnetic north and magnetic declination==
[[Image:IGRF 2000 magnetic declination.gif|thumb|Magnetic declination from true north in 2000.]]
{{main article|Magnetic declination}}
Historically, the magnetic [[compass]] was an important tool for [[navigation]]. While it has been widely replaced by [[global positioning system]]s, many airplanes and ships still carry them, as do casual boaters and hikers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Compass |url=https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/compass/ |website=National Geographic Society |accessdate=25 August 2018 |language=en |date=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The direction in which a [[compass]] needle points is known as magnetic north. In general, this is not exactly the direction of the North Magnetic Pole (or of any other consistent location). Instead, the compass aligns itself to the local geomagnetic field, which varies in a complex manner over the Earth's surface, as well as over time. The local angular difference between magnetic north and [[true north]] is called the [[magnetic declination]]. Most map coordinate systems are based on true north, and magnetic declination is often shown on map legends so that the direction of true north can be determined from north as indicated by a compass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Magnetic declination |url=http://www.geomag.nrcan.gc.ca/mag_fld/magdec-en.php |website=Natural Resources Canada |publisher=Government of Canada |accessdate=25 August 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In North America the line of zero declination (the ''agonic line'') runs from the North Magnetic Pole down through [[Lake Superior]] and southward into the [[Gulf of Mexico]] (see figure). Along this line, true north is the same as magnetic north. West of the agonic line a compass will give a reading that is east of true north and by convention the magnetic declination is positive. Conversely, east of the agonic line a compass will point west of true north and the declination is negative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=USGS Education |title=How To Use a Compass with a USGS Topographic Map |url=https://education.usgs.gov/lessons/compass.html |publisher=United States Geological Survey |accessdate=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== North Geomagnetic Pole ==
{{Main article|Geomagnetic pole}}

As a [[Orders of approximation|first-order approximation]], the Earth's magnetic field can be modelled as a simple [[dipole]] (like a bar magnet), tilted about 10° with respect to the [[Earth's rotation]] axis (which defines the Geographic North and Geographic South Poles) and centred at the Earth's centre. The North and South Geomagnetic Poles are the [[wikt:antipodal|antipodal]] points where the axis of this theoretical dipole intersects the Earth's surface. If the Earth's magnetic field were a perfect dipole then the [[field line]]s would be vertical at the Geomagnetic Poles, and they would coincide with the Magnetic Poles. However, the approximation is imperfect, and so the Magnetic and Geomagnetic Poles lie some distance apart.&lt;ref name="NGDC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/faqgeom.shtml |title=Geomagnetism Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=National Geophysical Data Center |accessdate=2018-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the North Magnetic Pole, the North Geomagnetic Pole attracts the north pole of a bar [[magnet]] and so is in a physical sense actually a magnetic ''south'' pole. It is the centre of the region of the [[magnetosphere]] in which the [[Aurora Borealis]] can be seen. As of 2015 it was located at approximately {{Coord|80.37|N|72.62|W|name=Geomagnetic North Pole 2005 est}}, over [[Ellesmere Island]], Canada&lt;ref name="NGDC"/&gt; but it is now drifting away from North America and toward Siberia.

==Geomagnetic reversal==
{{Main article|Geomagnetic reversal}}
Over the life of the Earth, the orientation of Earth's magnetic field has reversed many times, with magnetic north becoming magnetic south and vice versa – an event known as a [[geomagnetic reversal]]. Evidence of geomagnetic reversals can be seen at [[mid-ocean ridge]]s where [[tectonic plate]]s move apart and the seabed is filled in with [[magma]]. As the magma seeps out of the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] the magnetic particles contained within it are oriented in the direction of the magnetic field at the time the magma cools and solidifies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2003/29dec_magneticfield/|title=Earth's Inconstant Magnetic Field - Science Mission Directorate|website=science.nasa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2488">In [[complex geometry]], a '''polar homology''' is a group which captures holomorphic invariants &lt;!--What's that?--&gt; of a [[complex manifold]] in a similar way to usual [[Homology (mathematics)|homology]] of a [[manifold (mathematics)|manifold]] in [[differential topology]]. Polar homology was defined by B. Khesin and A. Rosly in 1999.

==Definition==
Let ''M'' be a [[complex projective manifold]]. The space &lt;math&gt;C_k&lt;/math&gt; of polar ''k''-chains is a vector space over &lt;math&gt;{\Bbb C}&lt;/math&gt; defined as a quotient &lt;math&gt;A_k/R_k&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;A_k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_k&lt;/math&gt; vector spaces defined below.

===Defining &lt;math&gt;A_k&lt;/math&gt;===
The space &lt;math&gt;A_k&lt;/math&gt; is freely generated by  the triples &lt;math&gt;(X, f, \alpha)&lt;/math&gt;, where ''X'' is a smooth, ''k''-dimensional complex manifold, &lt;math&gt;f:\; X \mapsto M&lt;/math&gt; a holomorphic map, and &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is a rational ''k''-form on ''X'', with first order poles on a [[normal crossing divisor|divisor with normal crossing]].

===Defining &lt;math&gt;R_k&lt;/math&gt;===
The space &lt;math&gt;R_k&lt;/math&gt; is generated by the following relations.

#&lt;math&gt;\lambda (X, f, \alpha)=(X, f, \lambda\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;(X,f,\alpha)=0&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\dim f(X) &lt; k&lt;/math&gt;.
#&lt;math&gt;\ \sum_i(X_i,f_i,\alpha_i)=0&lt;/math&gt; provided that 
::&lt;math&gt;\sum_if_{i*}\alpha_i\equiv 0,&lt;/math&gt; 

:where 

:&lt;math&gt;dim \;f_i(X_i)=k&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and the push-forwards &lt;math&gt;f_{i*}\alpha_i&lt;/math&gt; are considered on the smooth part of &lt;math&gt;\cup_i f_i(X_i)&lt;/math&gt;.

===Defining the boundary operator ===

The boundary operator &lt;math&gt;\partial:\; C_k \mapsto C_{k-1}&lt;/math&gt; is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\partial(X,f,\alpha)=2\pi \sqrt{-1}\sum_i(V_i, f_i, res_{V_i}\,\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;V_i&lt;/math&gt; are components of the polar divisor of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, ''res'' is the [[Poincaré residue]], and &lt;math&gt;f_i=f|_{V_i}&lt;/math&gt; are restrictions of the map ''f'' to each component of the divisor.

Khesin and Rosly proved that this boundary operator is well defined, and satisfies &lt;math&gt;\partial^2=0&lt;/math&gt;. They defined the '''polar cohomology''' as the quotient &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{ker}\; \partial / \operatorname{im} \; \partial&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7584">In mathematics a '''[[P-recursive equation]]''' can be solved for '''polynomial solutions'''. Sergei A. Abramov in 1989 and [[Marko Petkovšek]] in 1992 described an [[algorithm]] which finds all [[Polynomial ring|polynomial]] solutions of those recurrence equations with polynomial coefficients.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abramov|first=Sergei A.|date=1989|title=Problems in computer algebra that are connected with a search for polynomial solutions of linear differential and difference equations|url=|journal=Moscow University Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics|volume=3|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Petkovšek|first=Marko|date=1992|title=Hypergeometric solutions of linear recurrences with polynomial coefficients|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/0747-7171(92)90038-6|journal=Journal of Symbolic Computation|volume=14|issue=2-3|pages=243–264|doi=10.1016/0747-7171(92)90038-6|issn=0747-7171|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The algorithm computes a ''degree bound'' for the solution in a first step. In a second step an [[ansatz]] for a polynomial of this degree is used and the unknown coefficients are computed by a [[system of linear equations]]. This article describes this algorithm.

In 1995 Abramov, Bronstein and Petkovšek showed that the polynomial case can be solved more efficiently by considering [[Formal power series|power series]] solution of the recurrence equation in a specific power basis (i.e. not the ordinary basis &lt;math display="inline"&gt;(x^n)_{n \in \N}&lt;/math&gt;).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abramov|first=Sergei A.|last2=Bronstein|first2=Manuel|last3=Petkovšek|first3=Marko|date=1995|title=On polynomial solutions of linear operator equations|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=220346.220384|journal=ISSAC '95 Proceedings of the 1995 international symposium on Symbolic and algebraic computation|publisher=ACM|volume=|pages=290–296|doi=10.1145/220346.220384|isbn=0897916999|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other algorithms which compute [[Abramov's algorithm|rational]] or [[Petkovšek's algorithm|hypergeometric]] solutions of a linear recurrence equation with polynomial coefficients also use algorithms which compute polynomial solutions.

== Degree bound ==
Let &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\mathbb{K}&lt;/math&gt; be a [[Field (mathematics)|field]] of characteristic zero and  &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\sum_{k=0}^r p_k(n) \, y (n+k) = f(n)&lt;/math&gt; a [[P-recursive equation|recurrence equation]] of order &lt;math display="inline"&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; with polynomial coefficients &lt;math display="inline"&gt;p_k \in \mathbb{K} [n]&lt;/math&gt;, polynomial right-hand side &lt;math display="inline"&gt;f \in \mathbb{K}[n]&lt;/math&gt; and unknown polynomial sequence &lt;math&gt;y(n) \in \mathbb{K}[n]&lt;/math&gt;. Furthermore &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\deg (p)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the degree of a polynomial &lt;math display="inline"&gt;p \in \mathbb{K}[n]&lt;/math&gt; (with &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\deg (0) = - \infty&lt;/math&gt; for the zero polynomial) and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\text{lc}(p)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the leading coefficient of the polynomial. Moreover let&lt;math display="block"&gt;\begin{align}
    q_i &amp;= \sum_{k=i}^r \binom{k}{i} p_k, &amp; b &amp;= \max_{i=0,\dots,r}(\deg (q_i)-i), \\
    \alpha(n) &amp;= \sum_{i=0,\dots,r \atop \deg (q_i) - i = b} \text{lc} (q_i) n^{\underline{i}}, &amp; d_\alpha &amp;= \max \{n \in \N \, : \, \alpha(n) = 0 \} \cup \{ - \infty\}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;for &lt;math display="inline"&gt;i=0,\dots,r&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math display="inline"&gt;n^{\underline{i}} = n (n-1) \cdots (n-i+1)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Falling and rising factorials|falling factorial]] and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\N&lt;/math&gt; the set of nonegative integers. Then &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\deg (y) \leq \max \{ \deg(f) - b, -b-1, d_\alpha \}&lt;/math&gt;. This is called a degree bound for the polynomial solution &lt;math display="inline"&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. This bound was shown by Abramov and Petkovšek.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weixlbaumer, Christian (2001). [https://www.risc.jku.at/research/combinat/software/DiffTools/pub/weixlbaumer01.pdf Solutions of difference equations with polynomial coefficients]. Diploma Thesis, Johannes Kepler Universität Linz&lt;/ref&gt;

== Algorithm ==
The algorithm consists of two steps. In a first step the ''degree bound'' is computed. In a second step an ''ansatz'' with a polynomial &lt;math display="inline"&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; of that degree with arbitrary coefficients in &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\mathbb{K}&lt;/math&gt; is made and plugged into the recurrence equation. Then the different powers are compared and a system of linear equations for the coefficients of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is set up and solved. This is called the ''method undetermined coefficients''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.math.upenn.edu/~wilf/Downld.html|title=A=B|last=Petkovšek|first=Marko|last2=Wilf|first2=Herbert S.|last3=Zeilberger|first3=Doron|date=1996|publisher=A K Peters|others=|year=|isbn=1568810636|location=|pages=|oclc=33898705}}&lt;/ref&gt; The algorithm returns the general polynomial solution of a recurrence equation.

     Compare coefficients of polynomials &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\sum_{k=0}^r p_k(n) \, y (n+k)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;f(n)&lt;/math&gt; to get possible values for &lt;math display="inline"&gt;y_j, j=0,\dots,d&lt;/math&gt;

     '''else'''
         '''return''' false
     '''end if'''

== Example ==
Applying the formula for the degree bound on the recurrence equation&lt;math display="block"&gt;(n^2-2) \, y (n) + (-n^2+2n) \, y (n+1)=2n,&lt;/math&gt;over &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\Q&lt;/math&gt; yields &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\deg (y) \leq 2&lt;/math&gt;. Hence one can use an ansatz with a quadratic polynomial &lt;math display="inline"&gt;y(n) =y_2 n^2 + y_1 n + y_0&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math display="inline"&gt;y_0, y_1, y_2 \in \Q&lt;/math&gt;. Plugging this ansatz into the original recurrence equation leads to&lt;math display="block"&gt;2n = (n^2-2) \, y(n) + (-n^2+2n) \, y (n+1) = (y_1 + y_2) \, n^2 + (2 y_0 + 2 y_2 ) \, n - 2 y_0.&lt;/math&gt;This is equivalent to the following system of linear equations&lt;math display="block"&gt;\begin{align}
\begin{pmatrix}
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\ 2 &amp; 0 &amp; 2 \\ -2 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
y_0 \\ y_1 \\ y_2
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
0 \\ 2 \\ 0
\end{pmatrix}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;with the solution &lt;math display="inline"&gt;y_0 = 0, y_1 = -1, y_2 = 1&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore the only polynomial solution is &lt;math display="inline"&gt;y (n) = n^2-n&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Purushottam_Paranjpye.jpg|thumb]]
'''Sir Raghunath Purushottam Paranjpye''' (16 February 1876&amp;nbsp;– 6 May 1966) was the first Indian to achieve the coveted title of [[Senior Wrangler]] at the [[University of Cambridge]], and became a university administrator and Indian ambassador.

== ‘Wrangler’ – What does this honor mean? ==
Previously, at the Cambridge University of England, a student who gains first-class honors in the third year of the University’s undergraduate exam was honored by the title of ‘Wrangler’. The highest scoring student was called ‘Senior Wrangler’. R. P. Paranjape became a Senior Wrangler in the year 1899 by excelling in these exams. In those days, the exams were conducted only orally. Later in time they switched to exams in written format. The students appearing for exams would sit on a three legged stool; hence, the exams were named ‘Tripos’. The examiners would sit on a chair facing the student and intimidate them with the most difficult questions to test their true knowledge of the subject. The student, who would become senior wrangler, would further receive many awards and liberties. A senior wrangler would get many facilities for his further education; including a fellowship, a good position in the university and an invitation to write a book.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.talukadapoli.com/en/personalities/first-indian-wrangler-raghunath-purushottam-paranjape-from-dapoli/|title=First Indian Wrangler : Raghunath Purushottam Paranjape from Dapoli {{!}} Taluka Dapoli|website=www.talukadapoli.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Raghunath Paranjpye was born at Murdi near [[Dapoli]] in the coastal [[Ratnagiri district]] of [[Maharashtra]]. He was educated at Maratha high school, [[Bombay]], [[Fergusson College]], [[Pune]] and [[Bombay University]] before entering [[St John's College, Cambridge]] in 1896. He graduated B.A. as senior wrangler in 1899.&lt;ref name=Venn&gt;{{acad|id=PRNY896RP|name=Paranjpye, Raghunath Purushottam}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paranjpye was elected a [[Fellow]] of St John's College in November 1901&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=University intelligence |day_of_week=Tuesday |date=5 November 1901 |page_number=9 |issue=36604| }}&lt;/ref&gt; and stayed as such until 1907, but returned to India to become a professor of mathematics at Fergusson College in 1902.&lt;ref name=Venn /&gt; One of the earliest Indian documentary film makers, [[H. S. Bhatavdekar]], made silent documentary films, ''Return of Wrangler Paranjpye'' (1902) and ''Delhi Durbar of Lord Curzon'' (1903), featuring R.

==Career==
In 1907, R. P. became the first librarian of the [[Indian Mathematical Society]] at Fergusson College.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/indianmathsociety/newsletter17.htm&amp;date=2009-10-26+00:25:31  Newsletter 17], Indian Mathematical Society&lt;/ref&gt; He became the college's principal, and stayed in that position for two decades, until 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, he consecutively became the Vice-Chancellor of [[Bombay University]] and [[Lucknow University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.education.nic.in/cd50years/g/12/3H/123H0501.htm First Meeting of the Central Advisory Board of Education] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110211174854/http://www.education.nic.in/cd50years/g/12/3H/123H0501.htm |date=11 February 2011 }} 19–20, December 1935.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921, the [[University of Calcutta]] awarded him an honorary Doctor of Science degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Annual Convocation|url=http://www.caluniv.ac.in/convocation-2012/hony_degrees.htm|publisher=[[University of Calcutta]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120528004638/http://caluniv.ac.in/convocation-2012/hony_degrees.htm|archivedate=28 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir Raghunath was elected to the [[Bombay Legislative Council]] in 1912 representing the University of Bombay constituency. He was again elected to the enlarged Council as per the [[Government of India Act 1919]]. As part of [[Diarchy in Bombay Presidency]], Paranjpye was appointed as the first Minister for Education and he served in the position till 1923. He was unable to get elected in the 1923 elections losing to [[M. R. Jayakar]] of the [[Swaraj Party]].

Paranjpye received a knighthood from the colonial government in 1942.&lt;ref name=Venn /&gt; In the three years (1944–1947) preceding India's independence from the [[British Raj]], the British government appointed him India's High Commissioner to Australia.&lt;ref name=ASHA&gt;[http://www.asha-foundation.org/women/women/sai_paranjpe.php Sai Paranjpye at ASHA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217041336/http://www.asha-foundation.org/women/women/sai_paranjpe.php |date=17 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the days of the British Raj, there was some criticism that R.

{{Network Science}}

In [[mathematics]], '''random graph''' is the general term to refer to [[probability distribution]]s over [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graphs]].  Random graphs may be described simply by a probability distribution, or by a [[random process]] which generates them.&lt;ref name = "Random Graphs"&gt;[[Béla Bollobás]], ''Random Graphs'', 2nd Edition, 2001, Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of random graphs lies at the intersection between [[graph theory]] and [[probability theory]].  From a mathematical perspective, random graphs are used to answer questions about the properties of ''typical'' graphs.  Its practical applications are found in all areas in which [[complex network]]s need to be modeled&amp;nbsp;– a large number of random graph models are thus known, mirroring the diverse types of complex networks encountered in different areas. In a mathematical context, ''random graph'' refers almost exclusively to the [[Erdős–Rényi model|Erdős–Rényi random graph model]].  In other contexts, any graph model may be referred to as a ''random graph''.

== Models ==
A random graph is obtained by starting with a set of ''n'' isolated vertices and adding successive edges between them at random. The aim of the study in this field is to determine at what stage a particular property of the graph is likely to arise.&lt;ref name = "Random Graphs2"&gt;[[Béla Bollobás]], ''Random Graphs'', 1985, Academic Press Inc., London Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; Different '''random graph models''' produce different [[probability distribution]]s on graphs. Most commonly studied is the one proposed by [[Edgar Gilbert]], denoted ''G''(''n'',''p''), in which every possible edge occurs independently with probability 0 &lt; ''p'' &lt; 1. The probability of obtaining ''any one particular'' random graph with ''m'' edges is &lt;math&gt;p^m (1-p)^{N-m}&lt;/math&gt; with the notation &lt;math&gt;N = \tbinom{n}{2}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name = "Random Graphs3"&gt;[[Béla Bollobás]], ''Probabilistic Combinatorics and Its Applications'', 1991, Providence, RI: American Mathematical Society.&lt;/ref&gt;

A closely related model, the [[Erdős–Rényi model]] denoted ''G''(''n'',''M''), assigns equal probability to all graphs with exactly ''M'' edges. With 0 ≤ ''M'' ≤ ''N'', ''G''(''n'',''M'') has &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{N}{M}&lt;/math&gt; elements and every element occurs with probability &lt;math&gt;1/\tbinom{N}{M}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name = "Random Graphs2" /&gt;  The latter model can be viewed as a snapshot at a particular time (''M'') of the '''random graph process''' &lt;math&gt;\tilde{G}_n&lt;/math&gt;, which is a [[stochastic process]] that starts with ''n'' vertices and no edges, and at each step adds one new edge chosen uniformly from the set of missing edges.

If instead we start with an infinite set of vertices, and again let every possible edge occur independently with probability 0 &lt; ''p'' &lt; 1, then we get an object ''G'' called an '''infinite random graph'''. Except in the trivial cases when ''p'' is 0 or 1, such a ''G'' [[almost surely]] has the following property:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Given any ''n'' + ''m'' elements &lt;math&gt;a_1,\ldots, a_n,b_1,\ldots, b_m \in V&lt;/math&gt;, there is a vertex ''c'' in ''V'' that is adjacent to each of &lt;math&gt;a_1,\ldots, a_n&lt;/math&gt; and is not adjacent to any of &lt;math&gt;b_1,\ldots, b_m&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It turns out that if the vertex set is [[countable]] then there is, [[up to]] [[graph isomorphism|isomorphism]], only a single graph with this property, namely the [[Rado graph]]. Thus any countably infinite random graph is almost surely the Rado graph, which for this reason is sometimes called simply the '''random graph'''. However, the analogous result is not true for uncountable graphs, of which there are many (nonisomorphic) graphs satisfying the above property.

Another model, which generalizes Gilbert's random graph model, is the '''random dot-product model'''. A random dot-product graph associates with each vertex a [[real vector]].  The probability of an edge ''uv'' between any vertices ''u'' and ''v'' is some function of the [[dot product]] '''u''' • '''v''' of their respective vectors.

The [[network probability matrix]] models random graphs through edge probabilities, which represent the probability &lt;math&gt;p_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt; that a given edge &lt;math&gt;e_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt; exists for a specified time period. This model is extensible to directed and undirected; weighted and unweighted; and static or dynamic graphs structure.

For ''M'' ≃ ''pN'', where ''N'' is the maximal number of edges possible, the two most widely used models, ''G''(''n'',''M'') and ''G''(''n'',''p''), are almost interchangeable.&lt;ref name ="Handbook "&gt;[[Béla Bollobás|Bollobas, B.]] and Riordan, O.M. "Mathematical results on scale-free random graphs" in "Handbook of Graphs and Networks" (S. Bornholdt and H.G. Schuster (eds)), Wiley VCH, Weinheim, 1st ed., 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Random regular graph]]s form a special case, with properties that may differ from random graphs in general.

Once we have a model of random graphs, every function on graphs, becomes a [[random variable]]. The study of this model is to determine if, or at least estimate the probability that, a property may occur.&lt;ref name = "Random Graphs3" /&gt;

==Terminology==
The term 'almost every' in the context of random graphs refers to a sequence of spaces and probabilities, such that the ''error probabilities'' tend to zero.&lt;ref name = "Random Graphs3" /&gt;

==Properties==
The theory of random graphs studies typical properties of random graphs, those that hold with high probability for graphs drawn from a particular distribution.  For example, we might ask for a given value of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; what the probability is that &lt;math&gt;G(n,p)&lt;/math&gt; is [[Connection (mathematics)|connected]].  In studying such questions, researchers often concentrate on the asymptotic behavior of random graphs&amp;mdash;the values that various probabilities converge to as &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; grows very large. [[Percolation theory]] characterizes the connectedness of random graphs, especially infinitely large ones.

Percolation is related to the robustness of the graph (called also network).  Given a random graph of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; nodes and an average degree &lt;math&gt;\langle k\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. Next we remove randomly a fraction &lt;math&gt;1-p&lt;/math&gt; of nodes and leave only a fraction &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. There exists a critical percolation threshold &lt;math&gt;p_c=\tfrac{1}{\langle k\rangle}&lt;/math&gt; below which the network becomes fragmented while above &lt;math&gt;p_c&lt;/math&gt; a giant connected component exists.&lt;ref name = "Random Graphs" /&gt;&lt;ref name ="Handbook " /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Random graphs" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |title=Networks: An Introduction |last= Newman |first=M. E. J. |year= 2010 |publisher=  Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Complex Networks: Structure, Robustness and Function |authors= Reuven Cohen and [[Shlomo Havlin]] |year= 2010 |url= http://havlin.biu.ac.il/Shlomo%20Havlin%20books_com_net.php |publisher= Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="On Random Graphs" /&gt;

Localized percolation refers to removing a node its neighbors, next nearest neighbors etc. until a fraction of &lt;math&gt;1-p&lt;/math&gt; of nodes from the network is removed. It was shown that for random graph with Poisson distribution of degrees &lt;math&gt;p_c=\tfrac{1}{\langle k\rangle}&lt;/math&gt; exactly as for random removal. For other types of degree distributions &lt;math&gt;p_c&lt;/math&gt; for localized attack is different from random attack&lt;ref name="ShaoHuang2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shao|first1=Shuai|last2=Huang|first2=Xuqing|last3=Stanley|first3=H Eugene|last4=Havlin|first4=Shlomo|title=Percolation of localized attack on complex networks|journal=New Journal of Physics|volume=17|issue=2|year=2015|pages=023049|issn=1367-2630|doi=10.1088/1367-2630/17/2/023049|arxiv=1412.3124|bibcode=2015NJPh...17b3049S}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''(threshold functions, evolution of &lt;math&gt;\tilde G&lt;/math&gt;)''

Random graphs are widely used in the [[probabilistic method]], where one tries to prove the existence of graphs with certain properties. The existence of a property on a random graph can often imply, via the [[Szemerédi regularity lemma]], the existence of that property on almost all graphs.

In [[random regular graph]]s, &lt;math&gt;G(n,r-reg)&lt;/math&gt; are the set of &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;-regular graphs with &lt;math&gt;r = r(n)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; are the natural numbers, &lt;math&gt;3 \le r  &lt; n&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;rn = 2m&lt;/math&gt; is even.&lt;ref name = "Random Graphs2" /&gt;

The degree sequence of a graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;G^n&lt;/math&gt; depends only on the number of edges in the sets&lt;ref name = "Random Graphs2" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;V_n^{(2)} = \left \{ij \ : \ 1 \leq j \leq n, i \neq j \right \} \subset V^{(2)}, \qquad  i=1, \cdots, n.&lt;/math&gt;

If edges, &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; in a random graph, &lt;math&gt;G_M&lt;/math&gt; is large enough to ensure that almost every &lt;math&gt;G_M&lt;/math&gt; has minimum degree at least 1, then almost every &lt;math&gt;G_M&lt;/math&gt; is connected and, if &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is even, almost every &lt;math&gt;G_M&lt;/math&gt; has a perfect matching. In particular, the moment the last isolated vertex vanishes in almost every random graph, the graph becomes connected.&lt;ref name = "Random Graphs2" /&gt;

Almost every graph process on an even number of vertices with the edge raising the minimum degree to 1 or a random graph with slightly more than &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{n}{4}\log(n)&lt;/math&gt; edges and with probability close to 1 ensures that the graph has a complete matching, with exception of at most one vertex.

For some constant &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, almost every labeled graph with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; vertices and at least &lt;math&gt;cn\log(n)&lt;/math&gt; edges is [[Hamiltonian cycle|Hamiltonian]]. With the probability tending to 1, the particular edge that increases the minimum degree to 2 makes the graph Hamiltonian.

Properties of random graph may change or remain invariant under graph transformations. [[Alireza Mashaghi|Mashaghi A.]] et al., for example, demonstrated that a transformation which converts random graphs to their edge-dual graphs (or line graphs) produces an ensemble of graphs with nearly the same degree distribution, but with degree correlations and a significantly higher clustering coefficient.&lt;ref&gt;A. Ramezanpour, V. Karimipour, and A. Mashaghi. Generating correlated networks from uncorrelated ones. Phys. Rev. E 67, 046107 (2003)[http://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.67.046107]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Coloring ==
Given a random graph ''G'' of order ''n'' with the vertex ''V''(''G'') = {1, ..., ''n''}, by the [[greedy algorithm]] on the number of colors, the vertices can be colored with colors 1, 2, ... (vertex 1 is colored 1, vertex 2 is colored 1 if it is not adjacent to vertex 1, otherwise it is colored 2, etc.).&lt;ref name = "Random Graphs2" /&gt;
The number of proper colorings of random graphs given a number of ''q'' colors, called its [[chromatic polynomial]], remains unknown so far. The scaling of zeros of the chromatic polynomial of random graphs with parameters ''n'' and the number of edges ''m'' or the connection probability ''p'' has been studied empirically using an algorithm based on symbolic pattern matching.&lt;ref name = "Chromatic Polynomials of Random Graphs"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van Bussel | first1 = Frank | last2 = Ehrlich | first2 = Christoph | last3 = Fliegner | first3 = Denny | last4 = Stolzenberg | first4 = Sebastian | last5 = Timme | first5 = Marc | year = 2010 | title = Chromatic Polynomials of Random Graphs | url = | journal = J.

== Random trees ==
{{main|random tree}}
A [[random tree]] is a [[tree (graph theory)|tree]] or [[Arborescence (graph theory)|arborescence]] that is formed by a [[stochastic process]]. In a large range of random graphs of order ''n'' and size ''M''(''n'') the distribution of the number of tree components of order ''k'' is asymptotically [[Poisson distribution|Poisson]]. Types of random trees include [[uniform spanning tree]], [[random minimal spanning tree]], [[random binary tree]], [[treap]], [[rapidly exploring random tree]], [[Brownian tree]], and [[random forest]].

== Conditional random graphs ==

Consider a given random graph model defined on the  probability space &lt;math&gt;(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}(G) : \Omega \rightarrow R^{m}&lt;/math&gt; be a real valued function which assigns to each graph in &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; a vector of ''m'' properties. 
For a fixed &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p} \in R^{m}&lt;/math&gt;, ''conditional random graphs'' are models in which the probability measure &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; assigns zero probability to all graphs such that '&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}(G) \neq \mathbf{p} &lt;/math&gt;.

Special cases are ''conditionally uniform random graphs'', where &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; assigns equal probability to all the graphs having specified properties. They can be seen as a generalization of the [[Erdős–Rényi model]] ''G''(''n'',''M''), when the conditioning information is not necessarily the number of edges ''M'', but whatever other arbitrary graph property &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}(G)&lt;/math&gt;. In this case very few analytical results are available and simulation is required to obtain empirical distributions of average properties. Recently, a general and exact methodology for random graph simulation has been proposed&lt;ref name ="Mathematical programming approaches for classes of random network problems

Other recently studied ''conditional random graphs'' are the ''conditionally exponential random graphs models'', where &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; has an ERGM functional form for all graphs verifying &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}(G) = \mathbf{p} &lt;/math&gt;.

==Interdependent graphs==

So failures in one or several graphs induce cascading failures between the graphs which may lead to abrupt collapse.&lt;ref name="BuldyrevParshani2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buldyrev|first1=Sergey V.|last2=Parshani|first2=Roni|last3=Paul|first3=Gerald|last4=Stanley|first4=H.

In [[theoretical computer science]] and [[formal language theory]], a '''regular language''' (also called a '''rational language'''&lt;ref name="Mitkov2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lawson2003"/&gt;) is a [[formal language]] that can be expressed using a [[regular expression]], in the strict sense of the latter notion used in theoretical computer science (as opposed to many regular expressions engines provided by modern programming languages, which are [[Regular expression#Patterns for non-regular languages|augmented with features]] that allow recognition of languages that cannot be expressed by a classic regular expression).

Alternatively, a regular language can be defined as a language recognized by a [[finite automaton]]. The equivalence of regular expressions and finite automata is known as '''Kleene's theorem'''&lt;ref name="RozenbergSalomaa1997"&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Grzegorz Rozenberg |editor2=Arto Salomaa |title=Handbook of Formal Languages: Volume 1. Word, Language, Grammar|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yQ59ojndUt4C&amp;pg=PA41|year=1997|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-540-60420-4|page=41|author=Sheng Yu|chapter=Regular languages}}&lt;/ref&gt; (after American mathematician [[Stephen Cole Kleene]]). In the [[Chomsky hierarchy]], regular languages are defined to be the languages that are generated by Type-3 grammars ([[regular grammar]]s).

Regular languages are very useful in input [[parsing]] and [[programming language]] design.

==Formal definition==
The collection of regular languages over an [[Alphabet_(formal_languages)|alphabet]] Σ is defined recursively as follows:
* The empty language Ø, and the empty string language {ε} are regular languages.
* For each ''a'' ∈ Σ (''a'' belongs to Σ), the [[Singleton (mathematics)|singleton]] language {''a''} is a regular language.
* If ''A'' and ''B'' are regular languages, then ''A'' ∪ ''B'' (union), ''A'' • ''B'' (concatenation), and ''A''* ([[Kleene star]]) are regular languages.
* No other languages over Σ are regular.

See [[Regular expression#Formal language theory|regular expression]] for its syntax and semantics. Note that the above cases are in effect the defining rules of regular expression.

==Examples==
All finite languages are regular; in particular the [[empty string]] language {ε} = Ø* is regular. Other typical examples include the language consisting of all strings over the alphabet {''a'', ''b''} which contain an even number of ''a''s, or the language consisting of all strings of the form: several ''a''s followed by several ''b''s.

A simple example of a language that is not regular is the set of strings { ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;''b''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; | ''n'' ≥ 0 }.&lt;ref&gt;Eilenberg (1974), p. 16 (Example II, 2.8) and p. 25 (Example II, 5.2).&lt;/ref&gt; Intuitively, it cannot be recognized with a finite automaton, since a finite automaton has finite memory and it cannot remember the exact number of a's. Techniques to prove this fact rigorously are given [[#Location in the Chomsky hierarchy|below]].

==Equivalent formalisms==
A regular language satisfies the following equivalent properties:
# it is the language of a regular expression (by the above definition)
# it is the language accepted by a [[nondeterministic finite automaton]] (NFA)&lt;ref group=note&gt;1. ⇒ 2. by [[Thompson's construction algorithm]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;2. ⇒ 1. by [[Kleene's algorithm]]&lt;/ref&gt;
# it is the language accepted by a [[deterministic finite automaton]] (DFA)&lt;ref group=note&gt;2. ⇒ 3. by the [[powerset construction]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;3. ⇒ 2. since the former [[deterministic finite automaton#Formal definition|definition]] is stronger than the [[nondeterministic finite automaton#Formal definition|latter]]&lt;/ref&gt;
# it can be generated by a [[regular grammar]]&lt;ref group=note&gt;2. ⇒ 4. see Hopcroft, Ullman (1979), Theorem 9.2, p.219&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;4. ⇒ 2. see Hopcroft, Ullman (1979), Theorem 9.1, p.218&lt;/ref&gt;
# it is the language accepted by an [[alternating finite automaton]]
# it can be generated by a [[prefix grammar]]
# it can be accepted by a read-only [[Turing machine]]
# it can be defined in [[monadic predicate calculus|monadic]] [[second-order logic]] ([[Büchi-Elgot-Trakhtenbrot theorem]]&lt;ref&gt;M. Weyer: Chapter 12 - Decidability of S1S and S2S, p. 219, Theorem 12.26. In: Erich Grädel, Wolfgang Thomas, Thomas Wilke (Eds.): Automata, Logics, and Infinite Games: A Guide to Current Research. [[Lecture Notes in Computer Science]] 2500, Springer 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;)
# it is [[Recognizable set|recognized]] by some finite [[monoid]] ''M'', meaning it is the [[preimage]] { ''w''∈Σ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; | ''f''(''w'')∈''S'' } of a subset ''S'' of a finite monoid ''M'' under a [[monoid homomorphism]] ''f'': Σ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; → ''M'' from the [[free monoid]] on its alphabet&lt;ref group=note&gt;3. ⇔ 9. by the [[Myhill–Nerode theorem]]&lt;/ref&gt;
# the number of equivalence classes of its "[[syntactic relation]]" ~ is finite&lt;ref group=note&gt;''u''~''v'' is defined as: ''uw''∈''L'' if and only if ''vw''∈''L'' for all ''w''∈Σ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;3. ⇔ 10. see the proof in the ''[[Syntactic monoid#Syntactic equivalence|Syntactic monoid]]'' article, and see p.160 in {{cite book | last=Holcombe | first=W.M.L. | title=Algebraic automata theory | zbl=0489.68046 | series=Cambridge Studies in Advanced Mathematics | volume=1 | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | year=1982 | isbn=0-521-60492-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (this number equals the number of states of the [[DFA minimization|minimal deterministic finite automaton]] accepting ''L''.)

Properties 9. and 10. are purely algebraic approaches to define regular languages; a similar set of statements can be formulated for a monoid ''M''⊂Σ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;. In this case, equivalence over ''M'' leads to the concept of a recognizable language.

Some authors use one of the above properties different from "1." as alternative definition of regular languages.

Some of the equivalences above, particularly those among the first four formalisms, are called ''Kleene's theorem'' in textbooks. Precisely which one (or which subset) is called such varies between authors. One textbook calls the equivalence of regular expressions and NFAs ("1." and "2." above) "Kleene's theorem".&lt;ref name="SedgewickWayne2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert Sedgewick|author2=Kevin Daniel Wayne|title=Algorithms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MTpsAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA794|year=2011|publisher=Addison-Wesley Professional|isbn=978-0-321-57351-3|page=794}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another textbook calls the equivalence of regular expressions and DFAs ("1." and "3." above) "Kleene's theorem".&lt;ref name="AlloucheShallit2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jean-Paul Allouche|author2=Jeffrey Shallit|title=Automatic Sequences: Theory, Applications, Generalizations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2ZsSUStt96sC&amp;pg=PA129|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-82332-6|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two other textbooks first prove the expressive equivalence of NFAs and DFAs ("2." and "3.") and then state "Kleene's theorem" as the equivalence between regular expressions and finite automata (the latter said to describe "recognizable languages").&lt;ref name="Lawson2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark V.

==Closure properties==
The regular languages are [[closure (mathematics)|closed]] under the various operations, that is, if the languages ''K'' and ''L'' are regular, so is the result of the following operations:

* the set theoretic Boolean operations: [[Union of two regular languages|union]] ''K'' ∪ ''L'', [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] ''K'' ∩ ''L'', and [[complement (set theory)|complement]] {{overline|''L''}}, hence also [[relative complement]] ''K''-''L''.&lt;ref name=Sal28&gt;Salomaa (1981) p.28&lt;/ref&gt;
* the regular operations: ''K'' ∪ ''L'', [[concatenation]] ''K'' ∘ ''L'', and [[Kleene star]] ''L''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Sal27&gt;Salomaa (1981) p.27&lt;/ref&gt;
* the [[abstract family of languages|trio]] operations: [[string homomorphism]], inverse string homomorphism, and intersection with regular languages. As a consequence they are closed under arbitrary [[finite state transducer|finite state transductions]], like [[right quotient|quotient]] ''K'' / ''L''  with a regular language. Even more, regular languages are closed under quotients with ''arbitrary'' languages: If ''L'' is regular then ''L''/''K'' is regular for any ''K''.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}
* the reverse (or mirror image) ''L''&lt;sup&gt;R&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Hopcroft, Ullman (1979), Chapter 3, Exercise 3.4g, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; Given a nondeterministic finite automaton to recognize ''L'', an automaton for ''L''&lt;sup&gt;R&lt;/sup&gt; can be obtained by reversing all transitions and interchanging starting and finishing states.  This may result in multiple starting states; ε-transitions can be used to join them.

==Decidability properties==
Given two deterministic finite automata ''A'' and ''B'', it is decidable whether they accept the same language.&lt;ref&gt;Hopcroft, Ullman (1979), Theorem 3.8, p.64; see also Theorem 3.10, p.67&lt;/ref&gt;
As a consequence, using the [[#Closure properties|above]] closure properties, the following problems are also decidable for arbitrarily given deterministic finite automata ''A'' and ''B'', with accepted languages ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively:&lt;!---avoiding "L(A)" which hasn't been defined so far, and might be confused with the language variable "L" above---&gt;
* Containment: is ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; ⊆ ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; ?&lt;ref group=note&gt;Check if ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; ∩ ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;. Deciding this property is [[NP-hard]] in general; see [[:File:RegSubsetNP.pdf]] for an illustration of the proof idea.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Disjointness: is ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; ∩ ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; = {} ?
* Emptiness: is ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; = {} ?
* Universality: is ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; = Σ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; ?
* Membership: given ''a'' ∈ Σ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;, is ''a'' ∈ ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; ?
&lt;!---todo: give complexity for each problem, discuss other formalisms than just DFA---&gt;

For regular expressions, the universality problem is [[NP-complete]] already for a singleton alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;Aho, Hopcroft, Ullman (1974), Exercise 10.14, p.401&lt;/ref&gt;
For larger alphabets, that problem is [[PSPACE-complete#Regular expressions and automata|PSPACE-complete]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Hunt | first = H.

==Complexity results==

In [[computational complexity theory]], the [[complexity class]] of all regular languages is sometimes referred to as '''REGULAR''' or '''REG''' and equals [[DSPACE]](O(1)), the [[decision problem]]s that can be solved in constant space (the space used is independent of the input size). '''REGULAR''' ≠ [[AC0|'''AC'''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;]], since it (trivially) contains the parity problem of determining whether the number of 1 bits in the input is even or odd and this problem is not in '''AC'''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Furst | first1 = Merrick | last2 = Saxe | first2 = James B. | author2-link = James B.

If a language is ''not'' regular, it requires a machine with at least [[Big O notation|Ω]](log log ''n'') space to recognize (where ''n'' is the input size).&lt;ref&gt;J. Hartmanis, P. L. Lewis II, and R. E. Stearns. Hierarchies of memory-limited computations. ''Proceedings of the 6th Annual IEEE Symposium on Switching Circuit Theory and Logic Design'', pp. 179–190. 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, DSPACE([[Big O notation|o]](log log ''n'')) equals the class of regular languages. In practice, most nonregular problems are solved by machines taking at least [[logarithmic space]].

==Location in the Chomsky hierarchy==
[[Image:Chomsky-hierarchy.svg|thumb|250px|Regular language in classes of Chomsky hierarchy.]]
To locate the regular languages in the [[Chomsky hierarchy]], one notices that every regular language is [[Context free language|context-free]]. The converse is not true: for example the language consisting of all strings having the same number of ''a''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s as ''b''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s is context-free but not regular. To prove that a language such as this is not regular, one often uses the [[Myhill–Nerode theorem]] or the [[Pumping lemma for regular languages|pumping lemma]] among other methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/1031/how-to-prove-that-a-language-is-not-regular|title=How to prove that a language is not regular?|author=|date=|website=cs.stackexchange.com|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Important subclasses of regular languages include
* Finite languages - those containing only a finite number of words.&lt;ref&gt;A finite language shouldn't be confused with a (usually infinite) language generated by a finite automaton.&lt;/ref&gt; These are regular languages, as one can create a [[regular expression]] that is the [[Union (set theory)|union]] of every word in the language.
* [[Star-free language]]s, those that can be described by a regular expression constructed from the empty symbol, letters, concatenation and all [[boolean operators]] including [[Complement (set theory)|complementation]] but not the [[Kleene star]]: this class includes all finite languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Jörg Flum |editor2=Erich Grädel |editor3=Thomas Wilke |title=Logic and automata: history and perspectives|year=2008|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|isbn=978-90-5356-576-6|url=http://www.lsv.ens-cachan.fr/Publis/PAPERS/PDF/DG-WT08.pdf|chapter=First-order definable languages|author1=Volker Diekert |author2=Paul Gastin }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The number of words in a regular language==
Let &lt;math&gt;s_L(n)&lt;/math&gt; denote the number of words of length &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;.  The [[ordinary generating function]] for ''L'' is the [[formal power series]]

:&lt;math&gt;S_L(z) = \sum_{n \ge 0} s_L(n) z^n \ . &lt;/math&gt;

The generating function of a language ''L'' is a [[rational function]] if ''L'' is regular.&lt;ref name=Honkala&gt;{{cite journal | zbl=0675.68034 | last=Honkala | first=Juha | title=A necessary condition for the rationality of the zeta function of a regular language | journal=Theor.

such that for every &lt;math&gt;n \geq n_0&lt;/math&gt; the number &lt;math&gt;s_L(n)&lt;/math&gt; of words of length &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is
&lt;math&gt;s_L(n)=p_1(n)\lambda_1^n+\dotsb+p_k(n)\lambda_k^n&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Flajolet &amp; Sedgweick, section V.3.1, equation (13).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cs.stackexchange.com/a/1048/55|title=Number of words in the regular language $(00)^*$|author=|date=|website=cs.stackexchange.com|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://cs.stackexchange.com/a/11333/683 Proof of theorem for arbitrary DFAs&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cs.stackexchange.com/q/1045/55|title=Number of words of a given length in a regular language|author=|date=|website=cs.stackexchange.com|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, non-regularity of certain languages &lt;math&gt;L'&lt;/math&gt; can be proved by counting the words of a given length in
&lt;math&gt;L'&lt;/math&gt;. Consider, for example, the [[Dyck language]] of strings of balanced parentheses. The number of words of length &lt;math&gt;2n&lt;/math&gt;
in the Dyck language is equal to the [[Catalan number]] &lt;math&gt;C_n\sim\frac{4^n}{n^{3/2}\sqrt{\pi}}&lt;/math&gt;, which is not of the form &lt;math&gt;p(n)\lambda^n&lt;/math&gt;,
witnessing the non-regularity of the Dyck language. Care must be taken since some of the eigenvalues &lt;math&gt;\lambda_i&lt;/math&gt; could have the same magnitude. For example, the number of words of length &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; in the language of all even binary words is not of the form &lt;math&gt;p(n)\lambda^n&lt;/math&gt;, but the number of words of even or odd length are of this form; the corresponding eigenvalues are &lt;math&gt;2,-2&lt;/math&gt;. In general, for every regular language there exists a constant &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; such that for all &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, the number of words of length &lt;math&gt;dm+a&lt;/math&gt; is asymptotically &lt;math&gt;C_a m^{p_a} \lambda_a^m&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Flajolet &amp; Sedgewick (2002) Theorem V.3&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''zeta function'' of a language ''L'' is&lt;ref name=Honkala/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\zeta_L(z) = \exp \left({ \sum_{n \ge 0} s_L(n) \frac{z^n}{n} }\right) \ . &lt;/math&gt;

The zeta function of a regular language is not in general rational, but that of an arbitrary [[cyclic language]] is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | zbl=0797.68092 | last1=Berstel | first1=Jean | last2=Reutenauer | first2=Christophe | title=Zeta functions of formal languages | journal=Trans. Am. Math.

==Generalizations==
The notion of a regular language has been generalized to infinite words (see [[ω-automaton|ω-automata]]) and to trees (see [[tree automaton]]).

[[Rational set]] generalizes the notion (of regular/rational language) to monoids that are not necessarily [[free monoid|free]]. Likewise, the notion of a recognizable language (by a finite automaton) has namesake as [[recognizable set]] over a monoid that is not necessarily free. Howard Straubing notes in relation to these facts that “The term "regular language" is a bit unfortunate. Papers influenced by [[Samuel Eilenberg|Eilenberg]]'s monograph&lt;ref name="Eilenberg1974"&gt;{{cite book|author=Samuel Eilenberg|title=Automata, languages, and machines|publisher=Academic Press}} in two volumes "A" (1974, {{isbn|9780080873749}}) and "B" (1976, {{isbn|9780080873756}}), the latter with two chapters by Bret Tilson.&lt;/ref&gt; often use either the term "recognizable language", which refers to the behavior of automata, or "rational language", which refers to important analogies between regular expressions and rational power series. (In fact, Eilenberg defines rational and recognizable subsets of arbitrary monoids; the two notions do not, in general, coincide.) This terminology, while better motivated, never really caught on, and "regular language" is used almost universally.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Straubing | first=Howard | title=Finite automata, formal logic, and circuit complexity | series=Progress in Theoretical Computer Science | location=Basel | publisher=Birkhäuser | year=1994 | isbn=3-7643-3719-2 | zbl=0816.68086 | page= 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rational series]] is another generalization, this time in the context of a [[formal power series over a semiring]]. This approach gives rise to [[weighted rational expression]]s and [[weighted automata]]. In this algebraic context, the regular languages (corresponding to [[Boolean semiring|Boolean]]-weighted rational expressions) are usually called ''rational languages''.&lt;ref&gt;Berstel &amp; Reutenauer (2011) p.47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Sakarovitch | first=Jacques | title=Elements of automata theory | others=Translated from the French by Reuben Thomas | location=Cambridge | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | year=2009 | isbn=978-0-521-84425-3 | zbl=1188.68177 | page = 86 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in this context, Kleene's theorem finds a generalization called the [[Kleene-Schützenberger theorem]].

{{general relativity}}

In [[physics]], '''relativistic chaos''' is the application of [[chaos theory]] to [[dynamical system]]s described primarily by [[general relativity]], and also [[special relativity]].

One of the earlier references on the topic is (Barrow 1982) and a particularly relevant result is that relativistic chaos is coordinate invariant (Motter 2003).

'''Sequential dynamical systems''' ('''SDSs''') are a class of [[graph dynamical system]]s. They are discrete [[dynamical systems]] which generalize many aspects of for example classical [[cellular automata]], and they provide a framework for studying asynchronous processes over [[graph theory|graphs]]. The analysis of SDSs uses techniques from [[combinatorics]], [[abstract algebra]], [[graph theory]], [[dynamical system]]s and [[probability theory]].

==Definition==
An SDS is constructed from the following components:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
* A finite ''graph'' ''Y'' with vertex set v[''Y''] = {1,2, ... , n}. Depending on the context the graph can be directed or undirected.
* A state ''x&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;'' for each vertex ''i'' of ''Y'' taken from a finite set ''K''. The ''system state'' is the ''n''-tuple ''x'' = (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... , ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''), and ''x''[''i''] is the [[tuple]] consisting of the states associated to the vertices in the 1-neighborhood of ''i'' in ''Y'' (in some fixed order).
* A ''vertex function'' ''f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' for each vertex ''i''. The vertex function maps the state of vertex ''i'' at time ''t'' to the vertex state at time ''t''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 based on the states associated to the 1-neighborhood of ''i'' in ''Y''.
* A word ''w'' = (''w''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''w''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... , ''w&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'') over ''v''[''Y'']. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is convenient to introduce the ''Y''-local maps ''F&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' constructed from the vertex functions by

: &lt;math&gt;F_i (x) = (x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_{i-1}, f_i(x[i]), x_{i+1}, \ldots , x_n) \;. &lt;/math&gt;

The word ''w'' specifies the sequence in which the ''Y''-local maps are composed to derive the sequential dynamical system map ''F'': ''K&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; → K&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' as

: &lt;math&gt;[F_Y ,w] = F_{w(m)} \circ F_{w(m-1)} \circ \cdots \circ F_{w(2)} \circ F_{w(1)} \;. &lt;/math&gt;

If the update sequence is a permutation one frequently speaks of a ''permutation SDS'' to emphasize this point. 
The ''phase space'' associated to a sequential dynamical system with map ''F'': ''K&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; → K&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' is the finite directed graph with vertex set ''K&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' and directed edges (''x'', ''F''(''x'')). The structure of the phase space is governed by the properties of the graph ''Y'', the vertex functions (''f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'')''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', and the update sequence ''w''. A large part of SDS research seeks to infer phase space properties based on the structure of the system constituents.

==Example==
Consider the case where ''Y'' is the graph with vertex set {1,2,3} and undirected edges {1,2}, {1,3} and {2,3} (a triangle or 3-circle) with vertex states from ''K'' = {0,1}. For vertex functions use the symmetric, boolean function nor : ''K&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; → K'' defined by nor(''x'',''y'',''z'') = (1+''x'')(1+''y'')(1+''z'') with boolean arithmetic. Thus, the only case in which the function nor returns the value 1 is when all the arguments are 0. Pick ''w'' = (1,2,3) as update sequence. Starting from the initial system state (0,0,0) at time ''t'' = 0 one computes the state of vertex 1 at time ''t''=1 as nor(0,0,0) = 1. The state of vertex 2 at time ''t''=1 is nor(1,0,0) = 0. Note that the state of vertex 1 at time ''t''=1 is used immediately. Next one obtains the state of vertex 3 at time ''t''=1 as nor(1,0,0) = 0. This completes the update sequence, and one concludes that the Nor-SDS map sends the system state (0,0,0) to (1,0,0). The system state (1,0,0) is in turned mapped to (0,1,0) by an application of the SDS map.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4375">In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] field of [[real analysis]], a '''simple function''' is a  [[real number|real]]-valued function over a subset of the [[real line]], similar to a [[step function]]. Simple functions are sufficiently "nice" that using them makes mathematical reasoning, theory, and proof easier. For example, simple functions attain only a finite number of values. Some authors also require simple functions to be [[measurable function|measurable]]; as used in practice, they invariably are.

A basic example of a simple function is the [[floor function]] over the half-open interval [1, 9), whose only values are {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}. A more advanced example is the [[Dirichlet function]] over the real line, which takes the value 1 if ''x'' is rational and 0 otherwise. (Thus the "simple" of "simple function" has a technical meaning somewhat at odds with common language.) Note also that all [[step function]]s are simple.

Simple functions are used as a first stage in the development of theories of [[integral|integration]], such as the [[Lebesgue integral]], because it is easy to define integration for a simple function and also it is straightforward to approximate more general functions by sequences of simple functions.

==Definition==

Formally, a simple function is a finite [[linear combination]] of [[indicator function]]s of [[measurable set]]s. More precisely, let (''X'', Σ) be a [[sigma-algebra|measurable space]]. Let ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ Σ be a [[sequence]] of disjoint measurable sets, and let ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; be a sequence of [[real number|real]] or [[complex number]]s. A ''simple function'' is a function &lt;math&gt;f: X \to \mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; of the form

:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=\sum_{k=1}^n a_k {\mathbf 1}_{A_k}(x),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf 1}_A&lt;/math&gt; is the [[indicator function]] of the set ''A''.

==Properties of simple functions==
The sum, difference, and product of two simple functions are again simple functions, and multiplication by constant keeps a simple function simple; hence it follows that the collection of all simple functions on a given measurable space forms a commutative algebra over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Integration of simple functions==

If a [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] μ is defined on the space (''X'',Σ), the [[Lebesgue integral|integral]] of ''f'' with respect to μ is

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^na_k\mu(A_k),&lt;/math&gt;
if all summands are finite.

==Relation to Lebesgue integration==

Any non-negative [[measurable]] function &lt;math&gt;f\colon X \to\mathbb{R}^{+}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[pointwise]] limit of a monotonic increasing sequence of non-negative simple functions. Indeed, let &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; be a non-negative measurable function defined over the measure space &lt;math&gt;(X, \Sigma,\mu)&lt;/math&gt; as before. For each &lt;math&gt;n\in\mathbb N&lt;/math&gt;, subdivide the range of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;2^{2n}+1&lt;/math&gt; intervals, &lt;math&gt;2^{2n}&lt;/math&gt; of which have length &lt;math&gt;2^{-n}&lt;/math&gt;. For each &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, set 
:&lt;math&gt;I_{n,k}=\left[\frac{k-1}{2^n},\frac{k}{2^n}\right)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;k=1,2,\ldots,2^{2n}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;I_{n,2^{2n}+1}=[2^n,\infty)&lt;/math&gt;. 

(Note that, for fixed &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, the sets &lt;math&gt;I_{n,k}&lt;/math&gt; are disjoint and cover the non-negative real line.)

Now define the measurable sets 
:&lt;math&gt;A_{n,k}=f^{-1}(I_{n,k}) \,&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;k=1,2,\ldots,2^{2n}+1&lt;/math&gt;. 

Then the increasing sequence of simple functions 
:&lt;math&gt;f_n=\sum_{k=1}^{2^{2n}+1}\frac{k-1}{2^n}{\mathbf 1}_{A_{n,k}}&lt;/math&gt; 

converges pointwise to &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;n\to\infty&lt;/math&gt;. Note that, when &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is bounded, the convergence is uniform. This approximation of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; by simple functions (which are easily integrable) allows us to define an integral &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; itself; see the article on [[Lebesgue integration]] for more details.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1923">In the mathematics of [[probability]], a '''subordinator''' is a concept related to [[stochastic process]]es.  A subordinator is itself a stochastic process of the evolution of time within another stochastic process, the subordinated stochastic process. In other words, a subordinator will determine the [[random]] number of "time steps" that occur within the subordinated process for a given unit of chronological time.

In order to be a subordinator a process must be a [[Lévy process]].&lt;ref name=applebaum&gt;{{cite web|title=Lectures on Lévy processes and Stochastic calculus, Braunschweig; Lecture 2: Lévy processes|url=http://www.applebaum.staff.shef.ac.uk/Brauns2notes.pdf|author=Applebaum, D.|pages=37–53|publisher=University of Sheffield}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also must be increasing, [[almost surely]].&lt;ref name=applebaum/&gt;

[[File:Parabolic Segment.svg|thumb|A parabolic segment.]]
'''''The Quadrature of the Parabola''''' ({{lang-el|Τετραγωνισμὸς παραβολῆς}}) is a treatise on [[geometry]], written by [[Archimedes]] in the 3rd century BC. Written as a letter to his friend [[Dositheus of Pelusium|Dositheus]], the work presents 24 propositions regarding [[parabola]]s, culminating in a proof that the area of a parabolic segment (the region enclosed by a parabola and a [[line (geometry)|line]]) is 4/3 that of a certain [[inscribe]]d triangle.

The statement of the problem used the [[method of exhaustion]]. [[Archimedes]] may have dissected the area into infinitely many [[triangles]] whose areas form a [[geometric progression]]. He computes the sum of the resulting [[geometric series]], and proves that this is the area of the parabolic segment. This represents the most sophisticated use of the method of exhaustion in ancient mathematics, and remained unsurpassed until the development of [[integral calculus]] in the 17th century, being succeeded by [[Cavalieri's quadrature formula]].

== Main theorem ==
[[File:Parabola and inscribed triangle.svg|thumb|Archimedes inscribes a certain triangle into the given parabolic segment.]]
A '''parabolic segment''' is the region bounded by a parabola and line. To find the area of a parabolic segment, Archimedes considers a certain inscribed triangle. The base of this triangle is the given [[chord (geometry)|chord]] of the parabola, and the third vertex is the point on the parabola such that the tangent to the parabola at that point is parallel to the chord. By Proposition 1 (Quadrature of the Parabola), a line from the third vertex drawn parallel to the axis divides the chord into equal segments. The main theorem claims that the area of the parabolic segment is 4/3 that of the inscribed triangle.
&lt;!--
The diagram is misleading: The distances that are equal as a result of the proposition are the chord segments. The fact that the horizontal distances between the parallel vertical lines are also equal is a secondary result not as important.--&gt;

== Structure of the text ==
Archimedes gives two proofs of the main theorem. The first uses abstract [[mechanics]], with Archimedes arguing that the weight of the segment will balance the weight of the triangle when placed on an appropriate [[lever]]. The second, more famous proof uses pure geometry, specifically the [[method of exhaustion]].

Of the twenty-four propositions, the first three are quoted without proof from [[Euclid]]'s ''Elements of Conics'' (a lost work by Euclid on [[conic sections]]). Propositions four and five establish elementary properties of the parabola; propositions six through seventeen give the mechanical proof of the main theorem; and propositions eighteen through twenty-four present the geometric proof.

== Geometric proof ==

=== Dissection of the parabolic segment ===
[[File:Parabolic Segment Dissection.svg|thumb|300px|Archimedes' dissection of a parabolic segment into an arbitrary number of triangles.]]
The main idea of the proof is the dissection of the parabolic segment into infinitely many triangles, as shown in the figure to the right. Each of these triangles is inscribed in its own parabolic segment in the same way that the blue triangle is inscribed in the large segment.

=== Areas of the triangles ===
In propositions eighteen through twenty-one, Archimedes proves that the area of each green triangle is one eighth of the area of the blue triangle. From a modern point of view, this is because the green triangle has half the width and a fourth of the height:&lt;ref&gt;The green triangle has half of the width of blue triangle by construction. The statement about the height follows from the geometric properties of a parabola, and is easy to prove using modern [[analytic geometry]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Quadrature Parabola Relative Sizes.svg|center]]

By extension, each of the yellow triangles has one eighth the area of a green triangle, each of the red triangles has one eighth the area of a yellow triangle, and so on. Using the [[method of exhaustion]], it follows that the total area of the parabolic segment is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Area}\;=\;T \,+\, 2\left(\frac{T}{8}\right) \,+\, 4\left(\frac{T}{8^2}\right) \,+\, 8 \left(\frac{T}{8^3}\right) \,+\, \cdots.&lt;/math&gt;

Here ''T'' represents the area of the large blue triangle, the second term represents the total area of the two green triangles, the third term represents the total area of the four yellow triangles, and so forth. This simplifies to give

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Area}\;=\;\left(1 \,+\, \frac{1}{4} \,+\, \frac{1}{16} \,+\, \frac{1}{64} \,+\, \cdots\right)T.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Sum of the series ===
[[File:GeometricSquares.svg|thumb|Archimedes' proof that {{nowrap|1/4 + 1/16 + 1/64 + ... {{=}} 1/3}}]]
To complete the proof, Archimedes shows that

:&lt;math&gt;1 \,+\, \frac{1}{4} \,+\, \frac{1}{16} \,+\, \frac{1}{64} \,+\, \cdots\;=\; \frac{4}{3}.&lt;/math&gt;

The formula above is a [[geometric series]]—each successive term is one fourth of the previous term. In modern mathematics, that formula is a special case of the [[geometric series#Sum|sum formula for a geometric series]].

Archimedes evaluates the sum using an entirely geometric method,&lt;ref&gt;Strictly speaking, Archimedes evaluates the [[partial sum]]s of this series, and uses the [[Archimedean property]] to argue that the partial sums become arbitrarily close to 4/3. This is logically equivalent to the modern idea of summing an infinite series.&lt;/ref&gt; illustrated in the adjacent picture. This picture shows a unit square which has been dissected into an infinity of smaller squares. Each successive purple square has one fourth the area of the previous square, with the total purple area being the sum

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{4} \,+\, \frac{1}{16} \,+\, \frac{1}{64} \,+\, \cdots.&lt;/math&gt;

However, the purple squares are congruent to either set of yellow squares, and so cover 1/3 of the area of the unit square. It follows that the series above sums to 4/3.

==Education==
Yvonne was born in Lille in 1923. Her mother was the philosophy professor Berthe Hubert, her father was the physicist {{Interlanguage link multi|Georges Bruhat|fr}} (1887 - 1945) (who died in the concentration camp [[Oranienburg-Sachsenhausen]]) and her brother was the mathematician [[François Bruhat]]. Yvonne Choquet-Bruhat undertook her secondary school education in Paris.  In 1941 she entered the Concours General, a competition to determine the best pupils in the whole of France, and won the silver medal for physics. From 1943 to 1946 she studied at the ''[[École Normale Supérieure]]'' ("ENS") in [[Paris]] and from 1946 was a teaching assistant there and undertook research advised by [[André Lichnerowicz]]. From 1949 to 1951 she was a research assistant at the [[French National Centre for Scientific Research]] ("CNRS"), as a result of which she received her doctorate.&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy|103574}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Yvonne Choquet-Bruhat has worked in a range of areas in mathematical physics, applying results from the analysis of partial differential equations and differential geometry to provide a firm basis for solutions in physics. From 1951-1952 she worked at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in Princeton, under the supervision of [[Albert Einstein]], where she proved the local existence and uniqueness of solutions to the vacuum [[Einstein Equations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}}Y. Choquet-Bruhat, Théorème d'existence pour certains systèmes d'équations aux dérivées partielles non linéaires, Acta math., 88 (1952), pp. 141–225.&lt;/ref&gt; Her work proves the well-posedness of the Einstein equation, and started the study of dynamics in General Relativity. 

The following year Yvonne Choquet-Bruhat joined the faculty at Marseilles and in 1958 she was awarded the [[CNRS Silver Medal]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physics.ucla.edu/~cwp/Phase2/Choquet-Bruhat,_Yvonne@922345678.html#honors Yvonne Choquet-Bruhat page] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219231821/http://www.physics.ucla.edu/~cwp/Phase2/Choquet-Bruhat,_Yvonne@922345678.html#honors |date=February 19, 2012 }} at [http://www.physics.ucla.edu/~cwp/dev/exp.1.html ''Contribution of 20th Century Women to Physics'' pages] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029200133/http://www.physics.ucla.edu/~cwp/dev/exp.1.html |date=October 29, 2014 }} of [[UCLA]]&lt;/ref&gt; From 1958 to 1959 she taught at the [[University of Reims]].  In 1960 she became a professor at the ''[[Université Pierre-et-Marie-Curie]]'' (UPMC) in [[Paris]], and has remained professor or professor emeritus until her retirement in 1992.

At the Universite Pierre et Marie Curie she continued to make significant contributions to mathematical physics, notably in general relativity, supergravity, and the non-Abelian gauge theories of the standard model. Her work in 1981 with [[Demetrios Christodoulou]] showed the existence of global solutions of the Yang-Mills, Higgs, and Spinor Field Equations in 3+1 Dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;"Existence of Global Solutions of the Yang-Mills, Higgs, and Spinor Field Equations in 3+1 Dimensions," (with D. Christodoulou)&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally in 1984 she made perhaps the first study by a mathematician of [[supergravity]] with results that can be extended to the currently important model in D=11 dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;Causalite des Theories de Supergravite," Societe Mathematique de France, Asterisque 79-93&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978 Yvonne Choquet-Bruhat was elected a correspondent to the Academy of Sciences and on 14 May 1979 became the first woman to be elected a full member. From 1980 to 1983 she was President of the ''Comité international de relativité générale et gravitation'' ("International committee on general relativity and gravitation").  In 1985 she was elected to the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].  In 1986 she was chosen to deliver the prestigious  [[Noether Lecture]] by the [[Association for Women in Mathematics]].

== Choquet-Bruhat's theorem ==
Choquet-Bruhat's main theorem is one of the milestones of mathematical [[General relativity]]. Her theorem indeed establishes that General relativity has a well-posed [[Initial value formulation (general relativity)|initial value formulation]]. 

The theorem says the following: Given an initial data for the [[Einstein equation]], which is a triple (M, g, K) where M is a 3-[[manifold]], g a [[Riemannian metric]] and K a symmetric 2-tensor, which satisfies the [[constraint equations]], there exists a maximal [[Globally hyperbolic manifold|globally hyperbolic]] spacetime which verifies the Einstein equation with the given initial data. 

The proof makes use of a clever choice of coordinates, the [[wave coordinates]] (which are the Lorentzian equivalent to the [[harmonic coordinates]]), in which the Einstein equation becomes a [[hyperbolic PDE]], for which well-posedness results can be applied. 

== Private life ==
Yvonne Choquet-Bruhat has two daughters and a son, [[Daniel Choquet]].  She is a widow; her second husband was [[Gustave Choquet]]. She was previously married to Léonce Foures, a professor of mathematics at the Marseille faculty, who had studied with [[Henri Cartan]].

In [[representation theory]], a branch of mathematics, '''θ&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;''' is a cuspidal unipotent complex irreducible representation of the [[symplectic group]] Sp&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; over a [[finite field|finite]], [[local field|local]], or [[global field]].

{{harvtxt|Srinivasan|1968}} introduced θ&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; for the [[symplectic group]] Sp&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;('''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;) over a [[finite field]] '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt; of order ''q'', and showed that in this case it is
''q''(''q''&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/2-dimensional. The subscript 10 in  θ&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; is a historical accident that has stuck: Srinivasan  arbitrarily named  some of the characters of  Sp&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;('''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;) as  θ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, θ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., θ&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;, and the tenth one in her list happens to be the cuspidal unipotent character.

θ&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; is the only [[cuspidal unipotent representation]] of Sp&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;('''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;). It is the simplest example of a cuspidal unipotent representation of a [[reductive group]], and also the simplest example of a degenerate cuspidal representation (one without a [[Whittaker model]]).
General linear groups have no cuspidal unipotent representations and no degenerate cuspidal representations, so θ&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits properties of general reductive groups  that do not occur for general linear groups.

{{harvtxt|Howe|Piatetski-Shapiro|1979}} used the representations  θ&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; over local and global fields in their construction of counterexamples to the [[generalized Ramanujan conjecture]] for the symplectic group. {{harvtxt|Adams|2004}} described the representation θ&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; of the Lie group Sp&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;('''R''') over the local field '''R''' in detail.
