'''1833 in sports''' describes the year's events in world sport.

==[[Baseball]]==
'''Events'''
* Merger of the Olympic and Camden town ball clubs from [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] and [[Camden, New Jersey]], constituting the Olympic Ball Club of Philadelphia, often called the "Philadelphia Olympics".  The constitution would be revised in 1837 and published in 1838.&lt;ref&gt;[http://retrosheet.org/Protoball/chron.htm Protoball 1831.1 – Ball Club Forms in Philadelphia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090809204534/http://retrosheet.org/Protoball/chron.htm |date=2009-08-09 }}.

The 81st edition of the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|Tournament]] is scheduled to begin on March 19, 2019 and will conclude with the [[2019 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship Game|championship game]] on April 8 at [[U.S. Bank Stadium]] in [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Prather|first=Shannon|url=http://www.startribune.com/plans-for-2019-ncaa-final-four-already-underway/462596113/|title=Plans for 2019 NCAA Final Four are underway|work=[[Minneapolis Star Tribune]]|access-date=2017-12-08|date=December 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tournament procedure==
{{details|NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship#Tournament format}}
	
Pending any changes to the current format, a total of 68 teams will enter the 2019 tournament. 32 automatic bids shall be awarded to each program that wins their [[List of NCAA conferences|conference's]] tournament. The remaining 36 bids are "at-large", with selections extended by the NCAA Selection Committee.

Eight teams (the four lowest-seeded automatic qualifiers and the four lowest-seeded at-large teams) will play in the First Four (the successor to what had been popularly known as "[[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Opening Round game|play-in games]]" through the 2010 tournament). The winners of these games advance to the main draw of the tournament.

The [[NCAA basketball tournament selection process|Selection Committee]] will also seed the entire field from 1 to 68.

Humphrey Metrodome]], a two-time host in [[1992 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1992]] and [[2001 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|2001]]. The last time a venue hosted the Final Four for its first hosting of an NCAA tournament was [[1977 NCAA Division I Basketball Tournament|1977]] when Atlanta's [[Omni Coliseum]] hosted the Final Four. It will also see the tournament return to Hartford's XL Center for the first time since 1998. And, for the first time since 1970, the tournament will return to Columbia, South Carolina when it comes to the Colonial Life Arena, the second tournament the state will host since the end of the ban due to the [[Modern display of the Confederate flag#Display at South Carolina State Capitol|Confederate Flag controversy]].

The '''Ataturk Olympic Stadium''' ({{lang-tr|Atatürk Olimpiyat Stadı}}, {{IPA-tr|aˈtaˌtyɾc|pron}}) located in İkitelli, a district in the western outskirts of [[Istanbul]], is the largest-capacity stadium of [[Turkey]]. The stadium is named after [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]], the founder and first President of the Republic of Turkey. Its construction began in 1999 and was completed in 2002. It was built for Turkey's failed bid for the [[2008 Summer Olympics|2008]] [[Olympic Games]] that were ultimately awarded to [[Beijing]]. It cost about 140 million USD.&lt;ref name="tekfeninsaat1"/&gt;

With its 76,092 ([[all-seater stadium|all-seater]]) capacity and Olympic size, it was granted the "5-star sports complex" title by the [[UEFA]] in 2004, enabling it to host the finals of UEFA events. The [[2005 UEFA Champions League Final]] between [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] and [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] was played at the Atatürk Olympic Stadium on 25 May 2005. The stadium is also certified by the [[International Association of Athletics Federations|IAAF]] and [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] as a first-class venue for track and field, and has hosted several European athletic competitions. On 30 May 2020, the stadium is scheduled to stage its [[2020 UEFA Champions League Final|second Champions League final]].

[[Süper Lig]] football team [[İstanbul Başakşehir F.K.|Istanbul BB]] used the venue as their home ground until they moved to the [[Başakşehir Fatih Terim Stadium]] in 2014. [[Galatasaray S.K. (football team)|Galatasaray]] played its home games at the Atatürk Olympic Stadium during the 2003–2004 football season, due to the renovation of their own venue, the [[Ali Sami Yen Stadium]]. Galatasaray eventually returned to Ali Sami Yen for the 2004–2005 season, but played 2006–2007 [[UEFA Champions League]] group stage matches at the Atatürk Olympic Stadium. [[Sivasspor]] also played some of its [[Süper Lig]] home games at the Atatürk Olympic Stadium due to the bad weather conditions in their original hometown stadium. [[Beşiktaş J.K.|Beşiktaş]] used the arena in the 2013-14 season to play most of their home games, with the reasoning being the same as Galatasaray's, with their own ground, the [[Vodafone Arena]], scheduled to undergo renovation.

==Design and construction==
Istanbul Atatürk Olympic Stadium was originally conceived for the city's 2008 Olympic Games bid.

The stadium's two steel roofs (weighing 2,800 t and 1,300 t) were produced by [[Tekfen Construction and Installation Co.Inc.|Tekfen]]'s Steel Structure Fabrication Plant in Ceyhan, [[Adana]]. The west roof, designed in the form of a crescent and principally composed of a 1,000 t main beam called mega-truss, is supported by two reinforced concrete shafts with 196 m span.

With its 134 entrances and 148 exit gates, the Olympic Stadium allows 80,000 spectators to evacuate within 7.5 minutes, in case of an emergency. Two annex fields (for warm up / training purposes) are connected directly to the Olympic Stadium with an underground tunnel.

The Olympic Stadium's technical infrastructure and design ensure optimal visibility from all stands; a homogeneous sound level (102 decibels) with modern speaker systems, and a 1,400 lux illumination covering all areas of the stadium.

A 42,200 m2 commercial center is situated under the west roof, with a front facade length of 450 m and a total of 6 floors (3 floors below ground level.)

==Renovation==

===2005 UEFA Champions League Final===

From 2002 to 2005 the stadium had a capacity of 80,597 (all-seater). This was later reduced to 76,092 (all-seater) by removing the seats from where it was not possible to see the entire pitch, prior to the [[2005 UEFA Champions League Final]] game between AC Milan and Liverpool F.C., which was played on 25 May 2005.

=== UEFA Euro 2016 plans ===
The stadium was part of the turkish [[UEFA Euro 2016]] bid.
To meet all requirements of the [[UEFA]] for being able to organize the [[UEFA Euro 2016|Euro 2016]] football championship, the authorities planned to take major reconstruction works on this stadium. It was planned to increase the stadium's capacity to over 90,000 spectators and making it to the world's largest stadium with every seat under cover. To increase the net and gross capacity to 81,106 and 94,555&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jskarchitects.com/projekty/euro-2016-turcja-istambul.pl.html] JSK Architects&lt;/ref&gt; respectively, the pitch would have been lowered by 2.15 metres. In order to provide better convenience for the VIP guests and the media, all existing hospitality areas at levels 3 and 4 would have been  extended. Furthermore, 12 new boxes were planned to be added to the west stand and 32 to the east stand in order to add to the current number of 36 skyboxes; making a total of 80 skyboxes after the reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.turkishbidforeuro2016.com/index.php?mid=120 |title=Official website for Turkey's Euro 2016 bid: The Atatürk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul |access-date=24 February 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303191004/http://www.turkishbidforeuro2016.com/index.php?mid=120 |archive-date=3 March 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== UEFA Euro 2024 plans ===
For the [[UEFA Euro 2024 bids|UEFA Euro 2024 bid]] the [[Turkish Football Federation]] plans to rebuilt the stadium. The stands will be closer to the pitch, making it a football stadium&lt;ref&gt;[https://farm1.staticflickr.com/979/40843699035_e07da29e3c_b.jpg picture of the project]&lt;/ref&gt;. The stadium will have a capacity of 92,208&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tff.org/Resources/Tamsaha/UEFA_EURO24_Bid_Brochure/ UEFA EURO 2024 Turkey Bid Brochure]&lt;/ref&gt; and 191 suites. This will likely end Turkey's olympic prospects to bid olympics in 2030 -century centering it to Istanbul if athletics track were removed. The rebuild was made by Manchester based British architecture company AFL Architects.

==Concerts==

===U2 360° Tour===
On 6 September 2010, the renowned Irish rock band [[U2]] gave a concert at the stadium which reportedly attracted 54,278 fans, as a part of their [[U2 360° Tour]], the opening act of which was performed by the group [[Snow Patrol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sabah.com.tr/Yasam/2010/09/06/u2dan_unutulmaz_konser |newspaper=[[Sabah (newspaper)|Sabah]] |title=U2'dan unutulmaz konser |date=2010-09-07 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2010-09-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bank of America Stadium''' is a 75,523-seat [[American football|football]] [[stadium]] located on {{convert|33|acre|ha}} in uptown [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], United States. It is the home facility and headquarters of the [[Carolina Panthers]] of the [[National Football League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Stadium (panthers.com)|publisher=Carolina Panthers|url=http://www.panthers.com/stadium/|accessdate=December 25, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080704185651/http://www.panthers.com/stadium| archivedate=July 4, 2008&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium opened in 1996 as '''Ericsson Stadium''' before [[Bank of America]] purchased the naming rights in 2004. Former Panthers president [[Danny Morrison (sports executive)|Danny Morrison]] called it "[A] classic American stadium" due to its bowl design and other features.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.journalnow.com/sports/carolinapanthers/five-things-to-know-about-panthers-stadium-renovations/article_9ac821b0-8e6d-5170-9054-3063065fb3d8.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the Panthers, the stadium hosts the annual [[Belk Bowl]], which features teams from the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] (ACC) and the [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC), and was supposed to host the annual [[ACC Championship Game]] through at least 2019. The game was moved in 2016 but reinstated in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Conferences |publisher=Raycom |url=http://www.meinekecarcarebowl.com/conferences.htm |accessdate=December 25, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203192854/http://www.meinekecarcarebowl.com/conferences.htm |archivedate=December 3, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.wral.com/sports/story/2161744/|title=ACC Football Title Games to Tampa, Charlotte|publisher=[[WRAL-TV|WRAL]].com|date=December 12, 2007|accessdate=December 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ACC-13&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/colleges/acc-championship-game-to-remain-in-charlotte-for-2-more-years/2011/12/02/gIQAc8pXLO_story.html|title=ACC championship game to remain in Charlotte for 2 more years|publisher=[[The Washington Post|WashingtonPost.com]]|date=December 2, 2011|accessdate=December 4, 2011}} {{Dead link|date=January 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://hamptonroads.com/2011/12/acc-keep-title-game-charlotte-two-more-years|title=ACC to keep title game in Charlotte for two more years|publisher=[[The Virginian-Pilot|HamptonRoads.com]]|date=December 2, 2011|accessdate=December 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/acc-to-relocate-2016-football-championship-from-north-carolina-due-to-hb2-law/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/business/article145464904.html&lt;/ref&gt; The largest crowd to ever attend a football game at the stadium was on September 9, 2018 when 74,532 fans watched the Panthers defeat the [[Dallas Cowboys]] 16-8.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401030723&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sites considered for selection==
The Panthers organization considered several possible sites for the stadium's location before choosing the [[Charlotte center city]] site. Part of the site was occupied by the historic Good Samaritan Hospital. As part of the preparation for the 2019 [[Equal Justice Initiative]] Community Remembrance Project, Charlotte historian Michael Moore determined the site was also significant as the location of the city's first known [[lynching]] in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.charlotteobserver.com/sports/nfl/carolina-panthers/article219547375.html|title=Carolina Panthers stadium sits on top of Charlotte’s first documented lynching site|last=Funk}first=Tim|work=The Charlotte observer|date=October 5, 2018|accessdate=October 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One alternative was near [[NASCAR]]'s [[Charlotte Motor Speedway]] and the [[University of North Carolina at Charlotte]] in northeast [[Mecklenburg County, North Carolina|Mecklenburg County]]. Another was at the intersection of [[Interstate 85 in North Carolina|I-85]] and [[U.S. Route 74|US 74]] in western [[Gaston County, North Carolina|Gaston County]]. A popular option was to locate the facility near [[Carowinds]] amusement park, with the 50&amp;nbsp;yard line being on the state border of [[North Carolina]] and [[South Carolina]].

==Naming==
The stadium was originally known as '''Carolinas Stadium''', a name which remains in use for certain events such as [[FIFA]] matches. It opened in [[1996 in sports|1996]] as '''Ericsson Stadium''' after the Swedish telecom company [[Ericsson|LM Ericsson]] purchased the [[naming rights]] to the stadium in a ten-year, $25 million agreement.&lt;ref name="gnr062796"&gt;{{cite news |last=Hardin|first=Ed|title=Panthers' New Home Gets Name That Doesn't Quite Ring|newspaper=[[News &amp; Record|Greensboro News Record]]|pages=C1|date=June 27, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[2004 in sports|2004]], the stadium received its current name after [[Bank of America]] purchased the naming rights for 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-131553775.html Home of Carolina Panthers to be Called Bank of America Stadium]&lt;/ref&gt; Since Bank of America acquired naming rights, many fans now refer to the stadium as either "The Bank", "The BOA", "The B of A", or "The Vault".&lt;ref&gt;http://charlotte.about.com/od/CharlotteEventVenues/a/Bank-Of-America-Stadium.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stadium features==
Bank of America Stadium has many unique external features. Aspects of the stadium's architecture, such as the three huge main entrances, incorporate the team's colors of black, process blue and silver. Arches that connect column supports on the upper deck resemble the shape of half a football, while several acres of numerous trees and landscaping surround the building. The stadium's architecture and design has been compared to that of the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]] and [[Soldier Field]], among others. It's also received mentions for externally resembling "a fortress" instead of a stadium.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thesportsroadtrip.com/carolinapanthers.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of the stadium's entrances are flanked on both sides by two larger-than-life bronze panther statues, something unique throughout the entire NFL. These six statues are all named "Indomitable Spirit" and were installed in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.panthers.com/news/article-2/50-Things-Casual-Fans-Should-Know-About-The-Panthers/35019491-325d-4f12-a519-692954e6cbd2 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-02-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160222154540/http://www.panthers.com/news/article-2/50-Things-Casual-Fans-Should-Know-About-The-Panthers/35019491-325d-4f12-a519-692954e6cbd2 |archive-date=2016-02-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each one depicts a crouching, snarling panther with green eyes; they are the largest sculptures ever commissioned in the United States.&lt;ref name="Chronology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panthers.com/team/history/chronology.html|title=Chronology|work=Team History|publisher=Carolina Panthers|accessdate=January 19, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150927113839/http://www.panthers.com/team/history/chronology.html|archive-date=September 27, 2015|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Best Public Art in Uptown Charlotte"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://charlotte.cbslocal.com/top-lists/best-public-art-in-uptown-charlotte/|title=Best Public Art in Uptown Charlotte|date=October 1, 2012|publisher=[[CBS|CBS Charlotte]]|accessdate=August 28, 2013|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130828145316/http://charlotte.cbslocal.com/top-lists/best-public-art-in-uptown-charlotte/|archive-date=August 28, 2013|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The names of the team's original PSL owners are engraved into each statue's base.

Another striking feature the stadium contains are its six light domes. These are found on top of the main entrances, two per entrance, and sit over a hundred feet in the air. Originally, they simply glowed the Panthers' unique 'process blue' every night. As the seasons wore on, the emitted light became less and less impressive and the domes started showing their age. During the 2014 renovations, the domes were rebuilt with LED systems. They can now be seen again projecting process blue nightly in various ways not possible with the original technology.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wbmoore.com/projects/bank-of-america-stadium&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the two people currently in the Panthers Hall of Honor, former team executive [[Mike McCormack (American football)|Mike McCormack]] and former Panthers [[linebacker]] and assistant coach Sam Mills, are honored with life-sized bronze statues outside the stadium.&lt;ref name="Hall of Honor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panthers.com/team/history/hall-of-honour.html|title=Hall of Honor|publisher=Carolina Panthers|accessdate=January 19, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120719011416/http://www.panthers.com/team/history/hall-of-honour.html|archive-date=2012-07-19|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the 2014 renovations, the names of the hall of honor inductees were placed where the upper ribbon board now resides. These names were subsequently repainted onto the top rear wall behind the last row of seats. Additionally, three marble copies of a quote about the stadium from team founder Jerry Richardson were placed near the stadium's entrances in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://blackandbluereview.com/bank-of-america-stadium-jerry-richardson-letter/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, a statue was added in front of the stadium's north gate in celebration of Richardson's 80th birthday. The statue stands nearly {{convert|13|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} tall and features larger than life sculptures of Richardson flanked on both sides by two panthers. One panther stands on its hind legs, claws bared, while the other crouches. All three sculptures have the same bronze color and both panthers have the green eyes of and physically resemble the "Indomitable Spirit" statues.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.foxsports.com/nfl/story/carolina-panthers-jerry-richardson-founder-statue-80th-birthday-071816&lt;/ref&gt;

==Carolina Panthers==
[[File:Bank of America Stadium.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|The stadium in 2006.]]
In addition to hosting every Panthers home game since 1996, Bank of America Stadium has hosted seven playoff games. Carolina has also had over 150 consecutive sellouts at the stadium starting with the 2002 season.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sbnation.com/2014/9/18/6346533/jaguars-panthers-fans-20th-anniversary&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inaugural season===
The Panthers played their inaugural season at [[Clemson University]]'s [[Memorial Stadium, Clemson|Memorial Stadium]] while the stadium was being constructed. On August 3, 1996, the stadium played host to its first professional football game as the Panthers took on the [[Chicago Bears]] during the preseason. The inaugural kickoff was at 7:35 PM and Carolina won 30–12.&lt;ref&gt;http://retroclt.blogspot.com/2014/08/panthers-first-game-at-ericsson-stadium.html&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium's first regular season game took place on September 1, 1996 against Carolina's to-be division rival Atlanta; the Panthers won 29–6.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.panthers.com/team/history/chronology.html|title=Carolina Panthers  {{!}}  Chronology|access-date=2016-07-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150927113839/http://www.panthers.com/team/history/chronology.html|archive-date=2015-09-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Playoff games===
In 1996, on their way to their first [[NFC Championship Game]], Carolina defeated the then-defending [[Super Bowl]] Champion [[Dallas Cowboys]] in the first playoff game the stadium hosted. Again they defeated the Cowboys on their way to [[Super Bowl XXXVIII]] in [[Houston]] in 2004. Carolina was handed their first ever home playoff loss, 33–13, by the [[Arizona Cardinals]] on January 10, 2009 in the divisional round. The Panthers suffered a second home playoff loss against the [[San Francisco 49ers]] 23–10 on January 12, 2014 in the same round. On January 3, 2015, the Panthers won their first home playoff game in 12 years, defeating the Arizona Cardinals 27–16. En route to their fourth NFC Championship game appearance, the Panthers beat the [[Seattle Seahawks]] 31–24 in the divisional round on January 17, 2016. The Panthers defeated the [[Arizona Cardinals]] 49–15 in the NFC Championship game for their second NFC Championship in franchise history on January 24, 2016. This marked the first NFC Championship played and won at the stadium.

===Weather events===
Since it is an open-air stadium, Bank of America Stadium has been subject to a number of events caused by extreme weather.

*Perhaps the most memorable weather-related game the stadium played host to wasn't forecasted in advance. During a week 3 matchup with the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] in 2011, a huge rainstorm blanketed the stadium towards the end of the second quarter. This caused excess water on the upper deck to pour onto the lower deck and subsequently onto the field, every spot resembling miniature waterfalls. The field soon became flooded. [[CBS]] cameras captured numerous images, including players, some fans (many were in the concourses) and cheerleaders braving the elements.  Overall, four-plus inches of rain fell in under an hour.&lt;ref&gt;https://weather.com/sports-recreation/superbowl/news/nfl-football-worst-weather-games-20130906&lt;/ref&gt; Charlotte Magazine later termed the game as the "[2011] Water Bowl".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.charlottemagazine.com/Charlotte-Magazine/September-2015/Panthers-Jaguars-2011-Water-Bowl-An-Oral-History/&lt;/ref&gt; Carolina managed to win 16–10.&lt;ref&gt;http://espn.go.com/nfl/boxscore?gameId=310925029&lt;/ref&gt;
*In week 16 of the 2013 season, with the Panthers playing the Saints in a game that would give the Panthers a playoff berth, heavy rain and wind hit the stadium during the second quarter. Unlike the Jacksonville game, where wind had been a non-factor, the fans stayed in their seats and the rain moved on minutes later. The Panthers eventually won 17–13. 
*On a Monday night game during the 2015 season, a heavy rain kept up all night, making field conditions miserable. However, the fans again braved the elements. The Panthers held on to win 29–26.  
*In the days leading up to the 2015 NFC Championship game, the field and sections in and around the stadium were covered in snow and an ice/sleet mixture. However, the Panthers grounds crew along with help managed to clear the field before the game. Most of the snow/sleet around and/or inside the stadium was either cleared or had melted before the game began.
*On July 11, 2016 a severe storm hit the Charlotte area. Several lightning bolts struck the middle of the stadium, hitting the field. No one was injured.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/watch-mother-nature-unleashes-eye-popping-lightning-on-panthers-stadium/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact on NFL venues==
At the time of its construction in the mid-1990s, the stadium was a pioneering project for the use of [[Personal Seat License]]s. It was the first large-scale project funded in the United States chiefly through securing PSLs, which were a new idea themselves. The strength of PSL pledges impressed NFL owners and helped result in the Carolinas receiving the first NFL expansion team in nearly two decades. The [[Seattle Seahawks]] used the stadium, among others, as a reference when designing [[CenturyLink Field]].&lt;ref&gt;http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20001008&amp;slug=4046957&lt;/ref&gt; By 2013, the number of new or renovated stadiums since Bank of America Stadium opened had risen to 25.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000138612/article/carolina-panthers-to-start-stadium-renovations-after-2013-season&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stadium renovations==
[[File:BofAscoreboard.JPG|thumb|upright=1.35|One of the video boards installed in 2014.]]
During its first few seasons the stadium was considered so far ahead of its time that until the 2013–14 offseason, it only underwent minor improvements (aside from seating additions). The most notable of these improvements came in 2007 when the original scoreboards, video boards and displays from 1996 were replaced with 31.5' x 77' video boards and four ribbon boards: two spanning the length of the field on either side and two in opposing corners.
In the following years the stadium still wasn't considered as up-to-date as other NFL stadiums. Several reasons existed, including a lack of surround sound, smaller video boards compared to the rest of the league and poor cellular reception, among others. During the 2013 offseason, the Panthers renovated the home locker room. It now contained 74 lockers compared to 66 previously, the interior became more clean and modern, and the team's then-new logo was added throughout.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.panthers.com/news/article-2/Panthers-complete-locker-room-renovation-/84a54900-8863-4537-a3f4-0ca1292e2f6e |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-02-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206053112/http://www.panthers.com/news/article-2/Panthers-complete-locker-room-renovation-/84a54900-8863-4537-a3f4-0ca1292e2f6e |archive-date=2016-02-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Panthers proposed a $250 million stadium renovation project in early 2013, pending a vote by the city of Charlotte to help pay for it. This plan included two sets of new scoreboards, multiple escalators, infrastructure and concourse improvements, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.panthers.com/news/article-2/Panthers-detail-stadium-renovation-plans/55b2f431-2d35-4578-8def-b7f7c5ef3a29 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-11-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151212024030/http://www.panthers.com/news/article-2/Panthers-detail-stadium-renovation-plans/55b2f431-2d35-4578-8def-b7f7c5ef3a29 |archive-date=2015-12-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent vote by the city failed and efforts to get any money from the State of North Carolina failed as well. However, in April 2013 the Charlotte city council agreed to an $87.5 million deal for the renovations. This deal also keeps the Panthers in Charlotte until at least 2019.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000162501/article/charlotte-city-council-oks-panthers-stadium-upgrades&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the lower cost, the renovations would stay true to the team's original plans.

===2014===
In January 2014, the Panthers began the most significant renovations to the stadium in its 18-year history as part one of a multi-year renovation plan. The upgrades, completed by the start of the 2014–2015 NFL season, included numerous enhancements. First and perhaps most striking of all, two 200' x 56' HD video boards (over twice the size of their predecessors), and two 360° ribbon boards from [[Daktronics]] replaced the previous scoreboards/ribbon boards. The new ribbon boards were the tallest in the NFL&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.daktronics.com/en-us/success-stories/Carolina%20Panthers |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-08-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150921021519/http://www.daktronics.com/en-us/success-stories/Carolina%20Panthers |archive-date=2015-09-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the video boards were among the top ten largest in the NFL when installed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.daktronics.com/en-us/markets/sports/major-league-sports-installation/nfl&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, escalators were installed for the upper deck, making access easier for fans. These warranted extensions to the building itself which retained the stadium's original external designs. A new surround sound system was also included, with speakers placed around the perimeter of the bowl doubling as flagpoles. In addition, four covered open-air sections on the upper deck called "fan plazas" were added. Finally, LED-enhanced glass domes were installed along with new external signage above the main entrances.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bizjournals.com/charlotte/blog/queen_city_agenda/2014/01/carolina-panthers-thinking-big-with-upcoming.html?page=all&lt;/ref&gt;

===2015===
Prior to the start of the 2015 season, the Panthers renovated all 158 existing luxury suites to the stadium and added a new private club suite, dubbed "The 32 Club" due to its position at the 32-yard line. The team later announced another new club, dubbed the "51 Club" in honor of former player and coach Sam Mills, would also be added. These new installations decreased the stadium's number of luxury suites to 153,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bizjournals.com/charlotte/blog/queen_city_agenda/2015/05/carolina-panthers-adding-another-private-club-for.html&lt;/ref&gt; but increased overall [[seating capacity]]. The team also added two small ribbon boards above each tunnel entrance which are visible from the stands.

===2016===
Part three of the renovations included upgrading the upper-level concourse with buffet-style drink stations and installing double the amount of wi-fi access points than before. Updated signage reflecting the team's current logos and word mark was added to the upper concourse, as well as improved concession stands and new drink concessions. Most notably, almost 100 full-body scanners replaced the traditional "pat-downs" at the main entrances and a new security office was added, as well as other security improvements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/business/article90550717.html|title=What changes fans can expect at Bank of America Stadium this season|website=charlotteobserver.com|date=July 19, 2016|accessdate=July 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2017===
The fourth and final major renovation included updating the lower-level concourse by adding new signage, refurbishing concessions and installing updated televisions in the club levels. Banners depicting significant moments throughout Panthers history were also added to the concourse. The seating capacity was slightly increased thanks to upgrades at the club level. A new field and drainage system were additionally installed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.panthers.com/news/article-2/Stadium-renovations-in-full-swing-again/4b4ecdaa-1252-4f86-b90c-6961619e0bfb |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-02-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211110918/http://www.panthers.com/news/article-2/Stadium-renovations-in-full-swing-again/4b4ecdaa-1252-4f86-b90c-6961619e0bfb |archive-date=2017-02-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bizjournals.com/charlotte/news/2017/08/03/bofa-stadium-upgrades-in-most-recent-47-million.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==College football==
[[File:Second half kickoff, 2010 ACC Championship Game.JPG|thumb|right|Kickoff to start the second half of the [[2010 ACC Championship Game]]]]
Bank of America Stadium does not serve as the primary home stadium for any college football team. However, starting in 1996 the stadium has hosted many college football games.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.charlotteobserver.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/scott-fowler/article32677794.html&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The [[ACC Championship Game]], played on the first Saturday in December, pits the champion of the Coastal Division against the champion of the Atlantic Division; it had been held at the stadium from [[2010 ACC Championship Game|2010]] to 2015.  In February 2014, the ACC announced a 6-year contract extension to keep the game in Charlotte through 2019,&lt;ref name=ACC-13/&gt; but pulled out in September 2016 after North Carolina passed the [[Public Facilities Privacy &amp; Security Act]] (HB2).&lt;ref name="historically bad"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.wralsportsfan.com/acc-pulls-championships-including-football-game-from-nc/16014297/ | title='Historically bad:' ACC pulls championships from NC | publisher=[[WRAL-TV|WRAL.com]] | date=September 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was reinstated after HB2's repeal in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wcnc.com/sports/acc-championships-to-return-to-north-carolina/432463610&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Belk Bowl]] (formerly the Meineke Car Care Bowl and the Continental Tire Bowl), takes place in late December; it has been held annually in Charlotte since 2002.  The game pits teams from the [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]] against the [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]]. Charlotte-based department store [[Belk]] has been the game's sponsor since 2011 and holds sponsorship rights through 2019.
*The [[Belk Kickoff Game]] has been held at the stadium since 2015. The first meeting was between North Carolina and South Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;http://espn.go.com/college-football/game?gameId=400603840&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the Kickoff game featured NC State and South Carolina; in 2018 the game was played between West Virginia and [[Tennessee Volunteers football|Tennessee]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newsobserver.com/sports/college/acc/nc-state/article39602763.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*The stadium has hosted several [[East Carolina Pirates football|East Carolina Pirates]] games: in 1996 versus the [[NC State Wolfpack football|NC State Wolfpack]], in 1999 versus the [[West Virginia Mountaineers football|West Virginia Mountaineers]], in 2004 versus NC State, in 2008 versus the [[Virginia Tech Hokies football|Virginia Tech Hokies]], and in 2011 versus the [[South Carolina Gamecocks football|South Carolina Gamecocks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=East Carolina Announces Football Schedules Through 2013|publisher=East Carolina University|date=June 23, 2005|url=http://ecupirates.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/062305aaa.html|accessdate=December 25, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080105052840/http://ecupirates.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/062305aaa.html|archivedate=January 5, 2008|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=2006 East Carolina Football Media Guide|year=2006|publisher=East Carolina Athletic Department|pages=178–179}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 2006, Clemson played against Temple in the stadium. 
*Two games in the [[North Carolina-NC State football rivalry]] took place at the stadium in 1998 and 1999, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wralsportsfan.com/unc-ncsu-rivalry-has-delivered-plenty-of-classics/13057204/&lt;/ref&gt;
*Two more games between South Carolina and North Carolina are scheduled to be played at the stadium in 2019 and 2023.&lt;ref&gt;http://southcarolina.247sports.com/Bolt/Gamecocks-Tar-Heels-schedule-two-more-games-39099414&lt;/ref&gt;
*East Carolina will play [[Appalachian State Mountaineers football|Appalachian State]] at the stadium in 2021, with the Mountaineers designated as the home team.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wbtv.com/story/34279474/east-carolina-and-appalachian-state-to-face-off-at-bofa-stadium&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soccer==
[[File:Mexico vs Iceland Panorama (4463906303).jpg|thumb|right|Mexico vs Iceland, 2010]]

With a field large enough to meet the regulatory requirements for soccer, Bank of America Stadium has been host to several soccer matches.

*It was a site of the [[NCAA Men's Soccer Championship]] in 1999 and 2000.

[[Image:breaking concrete.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Breaking techniques are often practiced in [[taekwondo]]. Here four concrete paving bricks are broken with a knife-hand strike.]]
'''Breaking''' is a [[martial arts]] technique that is used in competition, demonstration and testing. Breaking is an action where a martial artist uses a striking surface to break one or more objects using the skills honed in their art form. The striking surface is usually a [[hand]] or a [[foot]], but may also be a [[finger]]tip, [[toe]], [[head]], [[Elbow-joint|elbow]], [[knuckle]], or [[knee]]. The most common object is a piece of [[wood]] or [[brick]], though it is also common to break [[cinder block]]s, [[glass]], or even a piece of [[metal]] such as [[steel]] bars. Glass is usually discouraged, since its shards may cause injury when broken.

Breaking can often be seen in [[karate]], [[taekwondo]] and [[pencak silat]]. [[Spetsnaz]] are also known for board and brick breaking, but not all styles of martial arts place equal emphasis on it or use it. In styles where [[Strike (attack)|striking]] and [[kick]]ing are less important and there is an emphasis on [[grappling]] or [[weapon]]ry, breaking is less prominent. [[Koryū|Traditional Japanese martial art schools]] place little, if any, emphasis on board-breaking, although the art of breaking objects was known as ''tameshiwari'', while the similar practice of [[Tameshigiri]] or 'test cutting' is used in [[iaijutsu|sword arts]].

== Types ==
Competitive breaking can be based on artistic impression, number of items broken in a given amount of time, number of items broken with a single strike, or time to break a number of items. There are several certified breaking categories in various journals of world records such as the [[Guinness Book]]. In a demonstration, a martial artist exhibits his or her skill by executing an impromptu or choreographed sequence of breaks for an audience. Martial arts schools sometimes demonstrate challenging breaks in order to gain publicity and inspire enrollment or attendance.

During promotion testing, many styles of martial arts require that students demonstrate their skills by executing breaks; the difficulty of a required break depends on the rank for which the student is testing. Failure to execute a required break is often sufficient grounds for failure of a promotion test.

== Materials ==
Wooden boards are the most common breaking item in most martial arts, Individual boards used may range from nominal sizes as small as 6″×12″×1″ (152×305×25&amp;nbsp;mm) to as large as 12″×12″×1″ (305×305×25&amp;nbsp;mm; a board with a nominal thickness of 1″ has an actual thickness of ¾″ or 19&amp;nbsp;mm). The typical adult testing board is approximately 10″×12″×1″ (254×305×25&amp;nbsp;mm).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usba.biz |title=United States and World Breaking Association|accessdate=July 15, 2008|publisher=USBA llc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The grain of the board must be cut so as to be parallel with the striking hand.

Children may use narrower and thinner boards, with 4- and 5-year-olds sometimes breaking boards as small as 4″×12″×½″ (102×305×13&amp;nbsp;mm), and there are also plastic boards made of different composites which can vary the difficulty level involved in breaking.

In general, breaking is used both as a method of measuring force of strikes for martial artists, as there was no other way to do this and only recently have devices such as [[accelerometer]]s been used in martial arts, and as a measurement of mental fortitude, the ability of the mind and body to overcome.

Generally, a martial artist engaged in breaking will practice by repeatedly hitting hard surfaces. [[Masutatsu Oyama]], a famous breaker who was known for breaking the horns off bulls,&lt;ref&gt;Kyokushin Canada. "Mas Oyama." http://www.kyokushincanada.com/sosaioyama.htm&lt;/ref&gt; would use trees. In karate, a device called a [[makiwara]] is used; this device has found more popular use by practitioners of other martial arts today. In the past, [[Shaolin kung fu|Shaolin]] and other earlier martial artists would use many different types of devices in order to condition themselves, not always for simply breaking, but using the same concepts used today. For instance, there is [[Iron Palm]], Iron Shin, [[Iron Shirt]], Iron Head, and other types of training which center around conditioning various parts of the body so they could withstand or give blows such as what is seen today in martial arts breaking. Many Chinese systems also are of the school of thought that "internal energy" or [[Qi|Chi]] is used when breaking, which is not dependent upon muscle strength and body weight.

The general principles used in martial arts breaking training is similar to the same principles used for most athletics. The body adapts to stress. There are generally three areas a martial arts breaker wishes to force their body to adapt to: the bones, the skin ([[callus]]es), and muscles (for both mass and speed). The general principle here — for instance, for the bones — is found in [[Wolff's law]], which states that the skeletal system will, after healing, be stronger if injury is put to it. Craig Edmunds demonstrates this theory after breaking hand in seminar measuring bone density then measuring bone density after healing. In this manner the breaking practitioner operates not unlike a bodybuilder who works out with weights, then takes a period of rest to heal and allow the muscles to come back stronger.

This kind of training is called "progressive resistance training"; see [[Weight training]] for more information. Often differences in body structure can be seen in the form of calcium deposits between a breaking practitioner and a non-practitioner. [[Mike Reeves]], a champion breaker, advocates in his book the usage of a makiwara and knuckle [[push-up]]s. With knuckle push-ups, he recommends starting on softer floor material and working your way up to concrete.&lt;ref&gt;Reeves, Mike, and Robert G. Yetman. ''Power Breaking: How to Develop and Use Breaking Skills for Self-Defense.''&lt;/ref&gt;

USBA/WBA Founder Drew Serrano, producer of the documentary "Breaking All Records",&lt;ref&gt;Serrano, Drew, and Christopher Vallone. ''Breaking All Records.'' 2007. http://www.eastcoasttrainingsystems.com/BAR%20Page.htm&lt;/ref&gt; encourages practitioners to gradually increase the difficulty and amount of a material to avoid injury. He suggests that beginners should start with wood boards and increase the amount as technical prowess increases. Once a level of comfort, both physically and mentally, is reached, harder materials such as concrete can be attempted.

There are safety concerns with martial arts breaking, so one should seek out an instructor. There are many small bones of the foot and hand which need to be very carefully and slowly conditioned for safety. Repeated damage to the extensor capsules of the knuckles can lead to long term problems with dexterity.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbard, John. ''Karate Breaking Techniques: With Practical Applications to Self-Defense.''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Speed vs. Power vs. Impulse vs Soft Break===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2010}}

There are generally 3 classifications of breaks: speed breaks, power breaks, and soft breaks. Additionally, there is a 4th, lesser-known, classification known as the impulse break.

''Speed breaks'' are breaks where the striking object is not held in place. The only way to break the object is to strike the surface with sufficient speed at a focused point of impact. Sometimes a board to be broken is held lightly between two fingers by a person; an advanced ''[[dan rank|dan]]'' test may involve an attempt to break a board as it falls through the air. Regardless of the strength of the striker, the board will only break if it is struck with sufficient [[velocity]].

Another type of "Speed Break" is that which involves breaking a number of objects over a given amount of time. A common time span is 1 minute, but this can vary depending on the material and venue. In competition it is very common for a speed breaking category to limit the time to 8–10 seconds, enabling more competitors to participate. Records and specifics are kept track of by leading martial arts breaking organizations such as the USBA/WBA (United States and World Breaking Associations) and the ISKA (International Sports Karate Association).

''Power breaks'' are breaks where the striking object is supported. Either the break will employ human holders for horizontal, angular, or upward vertical strikes, or the break will require that the objects be stacked for downward vertical strikes. For a stacked break the object is placed on sturdy supporting objects, such as concrete blocks, that are placed on the ground. Many color belt (belts before black belt) promotion testing breaks are power breaks—it is substantially easier for an inexperienced person to muster sufficient energy to break a wooden board with a power break (Note, this is not true for all breaks). The vast majority of these employ human board holders. Often a stronger or more powerful striker may substitute some strength for technique and successfully accomplish the break. Most records that are catalogued are for power breaks. It is very common for black belt tests to use bricks, concrete patio blocks, or several boards stacked on top of supporting objects for challenging downward strikes.

Taped boards are sometimes used to lessen the amount of human influence from the holders for a break. It is very difficult to hold a stack of boards more than 4&amp;nbsp;inches steadily enough for challenging break. Therefore, some strikers will tape a stack of boards together to make a "brick" for their holders to hold. Usually however, test breaks at promotions and events are done without taped boards.

Both the speed and power breaks deliver the energy required to overcome the tensor and flexion forces of the board through ''mass displacement'', where the kinetic energy is given by 1/2 m*v&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. That is, either the speed of the striking implement (hand/foot/etc.) has to be high enough, or the striker must be strong enough to increase effective mass brought into the break (i.e. his or her body weight) to exceed the brick/board's threshold. For single boards, it is generally easy (as in the casual person has a sufficient reserve of mass) to reach this threshold through a power break.

The third method, ''soft breaks'', also known as "[[qi|ki]]" breaks almost always involve the use of "flat hand" strikes; primarily the palm, as it's easier to accomplish a successful break with forward momentum, but sometimes the back of the hand (in a semi outstretched configuration) it utilized to exhibit the person's prowess, as this alternate method usually entails certain conditioning of the hand to endure the stress of impact (see note on Wolff's Law above) as well as using a less natural arm position when delivering the blow. The material is usually supported, horizontally, on two ends. The breaker raises their hand and lets it fall with no tension or significant flexing of the muscles, instead relying mostly on gravity, in order to palm strike the material. The material is broken by a complete energy transfer all the way through, in a direct line from the palm to the other side of the material. The impact also passes through a wider, more dispersed area and from a martial art perspective therefore causes more damage than other strikes, if delivered to a human adversary. This break is akin to striking a person with a slap, although more energy is transferred into the target than what is typically conveyed by a mere slap. Thus, such a palm strike can cause significant internal damage while leaving few signs of the damage externally (possibly a red mark but not much else), whereas a punch or similar strike, would tend to cause recognizably more external damage, such as bruising, swelling, etc., regardless of how much internal disruption was inflicted. Any person of any age, such as elderly people up to 80 and 90 years of age, can do this break with little injury to themselves. The most serious repercussions may be a palm that tingles afterward, should the break be unsuccessful. This method of break, even if utilizing more than one piece of material and additionally done with no spacers, is easily attainable by people of any age or gender, provided they have sufficiently practiced the technique. There are 2 reference videos at the bottom of the page: one shows Rudy Timmerman Sajanim, of the National Korean Martial Arts Association and the 9th degree Kong Shin Bup grandmaster, doing a multiple brick soft break, and another shows him teaching this unique soft breaking technique at a seminar.

Though fundamentally different, the 4th kind of break — the ''impulse break'' — is often confused with a speed break (i.e. the first one of the 2 types noted above), because the striking implement often moves at a high velocity, despite the success of the break not depending on such speed. But moving your hand or foot or other body part very quickly, is where the similarity ends. The energy transmission from an impulse break derives not from mass displacement, but from wave transmission (e.g. as an ocean wave hits a beach). The mass of the hand/foot/etc. typically does not travel through the medium, but only goes as far as necessary to deliver the wave—this results in an extremely brief contact with the face of the brick or board and it's the wave itself that causes the striking surface to flex and buckle. The less flexible the striking surface, the more likely it is to break. An advanced aspect of this type of break can be seen where several bricks are placed on supports without spacers, and the person performing the break chooses which brick will break, e.g. breaking ONLY the middle brick of 3 stacked bricks, although the top or bottom brick could just as easily be targeted. This feat was demonstrated in China in the early part of the last century, by well-known [[Qigong|qi-gong]] masters, many who performed it with 5 or 7 bricks or slabs of concrete, and the really talented masters could break two bricks, even if unconnected to one another (e.g. breaking the third and sixth bricks in a stack of 7).

===Pegged vs. unpegged (spaced vs. unspaced)===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2010}}
There are two types of multiple stacked board settings: pegged (spaced) and unpegged (unspaced). Unpegged stacks are where multiple items are stacked directly on top of each other.

Pegged stacks are stacks where multiple items are stacked with spacing items (often referred to as spacers) between them, usually wood spacers. "Unpegged" stacking allows a direct transfer of kinetic energy and the striker must maintain peak force much longer than an "pegged" stack as the striker moves down through the pile they are encountering the resistance of each board individually instead of creating enough force to flex and break an entire stack unspaced."

This is due to the way in which the two materials break. Wood, which is a natural fibrous matrix, flexes to a certain degree before it snaps at the target point. When unpegged, this allows for an entire stack of wood to flex upon impact, resulting in the break occurring in the order of furthest board from impact to the closest board (albeit a fraction of a second difference separates each board, making it appear instantaneous). This can be witnessed in many novice demonstrations where the rear board will break, but the remaining top boards are intact. When pegged, the gap between the boards necessitates each individual board to flex and snap before the next board is reached in succession. Bricks, on the other hand, are ceramic, and snap (or shatter) upon impact, with no flex action.

When using a pegged design, the setup and positioning of the pegs is critical. Competitors work extremely close with their team to ensure that each peg is in proper location and will not shift. A peg that shifts from its location can potentially interfere with the overall break of the stack. If careful consideration and measures are not taken, pegs will typically shift during the initial stack and setting of the break.

Concrete patio blocks, used in most major breaking competitions, require the competitor to "shock" the material and drive through from top to bottom.

Spacing of materials in competition is also important to enable a clear winner to be established as the number of stacked items increases. Whereas a limit of five unspaced patio blocks may be a common sticking point from one competitor to another, a stack of spaced patio blocks can provide more variables because of the increased confidence, which will narrow the field of competitors. This use of spacers makes competition more dynamic and exciting for competitors and spectators alike.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Greg Glassman and Lauren Jenai founded CrossFit, Inc. in 2000.&lt;ref name="dcpaleo.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Stephanie Cooperman| url= https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/22/fashion/thursdaystyles/22Fitness.html?_r=1| date=December 22, 2005| title= Getting Fit, Even if it Kills You|  publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was conceived a few years earlier, in 1996, as ''Cross-Fit''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Original 1996 CrossFit Founding|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/234726486/1996-CrossFit-Founding-via-Westlaw|website=Scribd|accessdate=July 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The original CrossFit gym is in [[Santa Cruz, California]], and the first affiliated gym was CrossFit North in [[Seattle, Washington]]; there were 13 by 2005, and today there are more than 13,000.&lt;ref name="iclubs.com"/&gt; Coaches associated with CrossFit include [[Louie Simmons]], [[John Welbourn]], [[Bob Harper (personal trainer)|Bob Harper]], and [[Mike Burgener]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://thewodclub.com/what-is-crossfit/ | title=The WOD Club - What is Crossfit | accessdate=February 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

CrossFit is a strength and conditioning program consisting mainly of a mix of [[aerobic exercise]], [[calisthenics]] (body weight exercises), and [[Olympic weightlifting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hines |first=E |title=Crossfit in Paris |url=http://expatriatesmagazine.com/index.php/publication/issue-1/contents/item/161-crossfit-in-paris |work=Expatriates Magazine |publisher=EP |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016055917/http://expatriatesmagazine.com/index.php/publication/issue-1/contents/item/161-crossfit-in-paris |archivedate=2013-10-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; CrossFit, Inc. describes its strength and conditioning program as "constantly varied functional movements executed at high intensity across broad time and modal domains,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Glassman|first=Greg|title=Understanding CrossFit|url=http://library.crossfit.com/free/pdf/56-07_Understanding_CF.pdf|publisher=The CrossFit Journal|accessdate=February 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the stated goal of improving fitness, which it defines as "work capacity across broad time and modal domains."&lt;ref name="Using Sport Education"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sibley|first1=Benjamin A.|title=Using Sport Education to Implement a CrossFit Unit|journal=JOPERD: The Journal of Physical Education, Recreation &amp; Dance|date=Oct 2012|volume=83|issue=8|pages=42–48|ref=17|postscript= Accessed Using Academic Search Complete at LSU|doi=10.1080/07303084.2012.10598829}}&lt;!--|accessdate=February 16, 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Hour-long classes at affiliated gyms, or "boxes", typically include a warm-up, a skill development segment, the high-intensity "workout of the day" (or WOD), and a period of individual or group stretching. Some gyms also often have a strength focused movement prior to the WOD. Performance on each WOD is often scored and/or ranked to encourage competition and to track individual progress. Some affiliates offer additional classes, such as Olympic weightlifting, which are not centered around a WOD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://prairiecrossfit.com/ |title=Prairie Crossfit |publisher=Prairie Crossfit }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"CrossFit is not a specialized fitness program, but a deliberate attempt to optimize physical competence in each of 10 recognized fitness domains," says founder Greg Glassman in the Foundations document. Those domains are: cardiovascular and respiratory endurance, stamina, strength, flexibility, power, speed, coordination, agility, balance, and accuracy.&lt;ref name="Shugart_20081104"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tmuscle.com/free_online_article/sports_body_training_performance_investigative/the_truth_about_crossfit |title=The Truth About CrossFit |first=Chris |last=Shugart |publisher=Testosterone Muscle |date=November 4, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100308115250/http://www.tmuscle.com/free_online_article/sports_body_training_performance_investigative/the_truth_about_crossfit |archivedate=March 8, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==CrossFit Games==
{{Main|CrossFit Games}}

The "CrossFit Games", directed by Dave Castro, have been held every summer since 2007. Athletes at the Games compete in workouts they learn about only hours beforehand, sometimes including surprise elements that are not part of the typical CrossFit regimen. Past examples include a rough-water swim, a [[softball]] throw, and a pegboard climb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Why the Pegboard Challenge at the CrossFit Games Was Such a Beast|url = http://www.mensfitness.com/training/pro-tips/why-pegboard-challenge-crossfit-games-was-such-beast|website = Men's Fitness|access-date = 2016-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Games are styled as a venue for determining the "Fittest on Earth," where competitors should be "ready for anything."&lt;ref name="Fittest on Earth"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Murphy|first1=Celina|title=Meet The Fittest Woman On Earth|url=http://www.independent.ie/lifestyle/health/meet-the-fittest-woman-on-earth-29589823.html|accessdate=February 16, 2015|newspaper=Ireland Independent|date=September 19, 2013|ref=37|postscript=Accessed via the Academic Search Complete Database at LSU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the Games adopted an online qualification format, facilitating participation by athletes worldwide. During the 5-week long "CrossFit Open", one new workout is released each week.  Athletes have several days to complete the workout and submit their scores online, with either a video or validation by a CrossFit affiliate. Since the Open is available to any level of athlete, many affiliates encourage member participation and the number of worldwide participants can be in the hundreds of thousands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://games.crossfit.com/article/209585-rise-open |title=209,585: Rise of the Open |publisher=CrossFit Games |date=March 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The top CrossFit Open performers for individuals and teams in each region advance to the regional events, held over the following two months around the world. Each regional event qualifies a specified number of its top finishers to send to the Games. The Games include divisions for individuals of each gender, co-ed teams, and a number of Masters and Teenage age groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fitworkshop.com/what-is-crossfit/|title=What is CrossFit?|publisher=|accessdate=February 1, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213131830/http://fitworkshop.com/what-is-crossfit/|archive-date=2015-02-13|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Certifications ==
In order to become a certified CrossFit coach, one must go through a series of four training levels. However, not all CrossFit gyms require their coaches to have all four levels of training- most gyms require at least level one certification. Level one (CF-L1) is the introduction level, where participants attend a group weekend class and talk about the basic methodology and fundamentals of CrossFit, and learn how to conduct their own classes. They go over techniques and how to adjust them for those who cannot perform them. Throughout the Level One training course, one should be confident in conducting a class, scale workouts accordingly for athletes, and hold CrossFit to its standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://training.crossfit.com/level-one|title=CrossFit Level 1 Certificate Course|website=training.crossfit.com|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second level, training goes deeper into the mechanics of the movements and how to be leaders and communicate with other students. In the level two course, participants learn about athletic capacity and are evaluated as a trainer in groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/288187-how-to-become-a-crossfit-trainer/|title=how to become a CrossFit trainer|last=Booe|first=Martin|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to earn the level three certificate, a coach one must complete 1,500 hours of active fitness coaching along with becoming CPR certified. To earn the level four certificate, the highest level currently recognized by CrossFit, Inc., the coach must record several years as a level three and pass a test.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://certifications.crossfit.com/|title=CROSSFIT|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

===Injury===

The risk of injury associated with CrossFit training has been a controversial question since the program’s popularity began to climb in the early 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title = Getting Fit, Even if It Kills You |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/22/fashion/thursdaystyles/getting-fit-even-if-it-kills-you.html|newspaper = The New York Times |date =December 22, 2005 |access-date =December 28, 2015 |issn = 0362-4331 |first = Stephanie |last = Cooperman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have accused CrossFit, Inc. of using dangerous movements, inappropriate levels of intensity, and allowing underqualified individuals to become CrossFit Trainers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Is CrossFit Dangerous? |url = https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-09-04/crossfit-fights-injury-reputation-as-community-aspect-fuels-growth |website = BloombergView|access-date = December 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Is CrossFit Safe?

In response to these criticisms, CrossFit, Inc. claims, “CrossFit is relatively safe even when performed with poor technique, but it is safer and more effective when performed with good technique.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = The Truth Hurts: Part 1|url = http://therussells.crossfit.com/2015/06/15/the-truth-hurts-part-1/ |website = THE RUSSELLS |access-date = December 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; CrossFit, Inc. also claims risk for injury can be reduced by properly scaling and modifying workouts, a concept taught on its website and at the CrossFit Level 1 Trainer Course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Scaling CrossFit Workouts by Jeremy Gordon, CF-L4 |url = http://journal.crossfit.com/2015/10/scaling-crossfit-workouts.tpl |website = CrossFit Journal |access-date = December 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://library.crossfit.com/free/pdf/CFJ_Seminars_TrainingGuide_012013-SDy.pdf |title = CrossFit L-1 Trainer Guide |date = May 15, 2010|accessdate = December 28, 2015 |website = CrossFit Journal |publisher = CrossFit, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CrossFit, Inc. supports this position by citing three academic surveys of CrossFit participants. These surveys calculated injury rates between 2.4 and 3.1 injuries per 1000 hours of training, which CrossFit argues is consistent with or below injury rates found in "general fitness training."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = The Truth Hurts: Part 1 |url = http://therussells.crossfit.com/2015/06/15/the-truth-hurts-part-1/ |website = THE RUSSELLS |access-date = January 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study published in the ''Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research'' entitled "Crossfit-based high intensity power training improves maximal aerobic fitness and body composition" followed 54 participants for 10 weeks of CrossFit training. The study said that "...a notable percentage of our subjects (16%) did not complete the training program and return for follow-up testing."

In response to this criticism, Greg Glassman has stated "We introduced (Uncle) Rhabdo because we're honest and believe that full disclosure of risk is the only ethical thing to do."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Social Media controversies ===
CrossFit, Inc. has been variously criticized and praised for its unorthodox approach to social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Coke, CrossFit, and Created Outrage |url=http://www.bodyforwife.com/coke-crossfit-and-created-outrage/ |website=Body for Wife |accessdate=2016-01-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Do Not Cross CrossFit |url=http://www.inc.com/magazine/201307/burt-helm/crossfit-empire.html |website=Inc.com |date=2013-07-02 |accessdate=2016-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=CrossFit's Sour Sense of Humor |url=http://www.outsideonline.com/1923956/crossfits-sour-sense-humor |website=Outside Online |accessdate=2016-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach has included publishing articles and tweets about non-fitness topics (including politics, philosophy, and poetry)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Five Things You Need To Know About CrossFit |url=http://nation.time.com/2014/01/10/five-things-you-need-to-know-about-crossfit/ |newspaper=Time |access-date=2016-01-06 |issn=0040-781X |first=Sean |last=Gregory}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.crossfit.com/mt-archive2/009563.html#/comments |title=Rest Day |date=April 23, 2015 |accessdate=6 January 2016 |website=CrossFit.com |publisher=CrossFit, Inc. |last= |first=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as directly interacting with other social media users and critics of the company's program.&lt;ref name = "GlassmanWarpath"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maxim.com/maxim-man/crossfit-greg-glassman-exclusive-2015-9 |title=Exclusive: On the Warpath with CrossFit's Greg Glassman |date=September 8, 2015 |accessdate=6 January 2016 |website= |publisher=Maxim.com |last=Bowles |first=Nellie}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 4 June 2014, CrossFit uploaded a "parody video to their Facebook page" of [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]], featuring concepts such as the "Holy Trinity of exercise".&lt;ref name=Martin&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christiantoday.com/article/the.crossfit.by.jesus.parody.that.takes.the.concept.literally.watch/37944.htm|title=The CrossFit by Jesus parody that takes the concept literally|last=Martin|first=Cath|date=7 June 2014|work=[[Christian Today]]|language=English|accessdate=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Yasmine Hafiz, in ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' wrote that some "viewers are outraged at the disrespectful use of a Christian symbol", with one user asking "on what planet is it comical or encouraged to mock someones belief"?&lt;ref name=Hafiz&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/05/crossfit-jesus-video_n_5453170.html|title=CrossFit Posts Jesus Parody On Facebook Page And The Comments Explode|last=Hafiz|first=Yasmine|date=5 June 2014|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|language=English|accessdate=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Martin/&gt;

In one example, CrossFit, Inc.'s [[Twitter]] account posted a doctored illustration of a Coke advertisement, with "Open Happiness" replaced by "Open Diabetes". The image was paired with a quote from CrossFit CEO Greg Glassman that read: "Make sure you pour out some for your dead homies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/crossfit/status/615539464232902656|title=CrossFit on Twitter|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qz.com/441699/its-not-okay-for-crossfits-ceo-to-joke-about-diabetes/|title=It's not okay for CrossFit's CEO to joke about diabetes|first=Svati Kirsten|last=Narula|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Controversy followed after singer [[Nick Jonas]] responded to the tweet, calling CrossFit, Inc.'s comments "ignorant".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=CrossFit Battles Coke, Jonas in Addressing Diabetes - Athletic Business |url=http://www.iclubs.com/featured-writer-blogs/crossfit-battles-coke-jonas-in-fight-against-obesity.html |website=www.iclubs.com |accessdate=2016-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company defended its tweet, stating that "Compelling statistical evidence supports CrossFit, Inc.'s campaign to prevent diabetes by raising awareness about its causes."&lt;ref name="GlassmanComment"&gt;{{cite web |title=Greg Glassman's Full Comment on Coca-Cola and Nick Jonas |url=http://therussells.crossfit.com/2015/07/07/greg-glassmans-full-comment-on-coca-cola-and-nick-jonas/ |website=THE RUSSELLS |accessdate=2016-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; When ABC News asked Greg Glassman to comment on the exchange, he replied "Fuck Nick Jonas.

==#s==
[[Image:Weightdiagram.svg|thumb|300px|Diagram that shows the number weight calling system as it relates to the ice surface. The tee line has been removed for clarity.]]
During a game, [[#S|sweepers]] might call out numbers. These numbers indicate how far the sweepers think the [[#R|rock]] in play will travel. This system is relatively new to the game and is often attributed{{by whom|date=March 2016}} to the [[Randy Ferbey]] rink since they were the first major team to use the system, but it is not known whose idea it originally was{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}. 1 to 3 indicates a rock in the free guard zone, 4 to 6 the rings in front of the tee line, 7 being on the button, and 8 to 10 the rings behind the tee line. Sometimes, 11 is used to indicate a stone thrown so that it passes through the [[#H|house]] and out of play. With this system, the sweepers can communicate more effectively where they think the stone will end up or the skip can better tell the deliverer how hard to throw it.

==#==
; 4-foot : The {{convert|4|ft|m|adj=mid|-diameter}} circle in the [[#H|house]]. It surrounds the centre area called the [[#B|button]]. It is used as a visual aid only – there is no extra score for placing a stone within it
; 8-foot : The {{convert|8|ft|m|adj=mid|-diameter}} circle in the [[#H|house]]. It is used as a visual aid only – there is no extra score for placing a stone within it; generally not actually painted – it appears as the empty space between the 12-foot and 4-foot rings
; 12-foot : The {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=mid|-diameter}} circle outermost in the [[#H|house]]; a stone completely outside this circle cannot score

==A==
; Across the face : On a [[#H|hit]], refers to the [[#S|shooter]] hitting the object stone on the opposite side from where the broom was placed. Since this imparts less speed to the object stone and takes less speed away from the shooter, it is a very efficient way of making a [[#T|tick]]. This is seldom used for normal hits since it is harder to execute, unless necessary because a [[#G|guard]] prevents using the other [[#T|turn]]
; Anti-freeze : A very rare and extremely difficult shot in which a stone is delivered so that it will come to rest behind another stone already in play, created the same effect as if one stone had been [[#F|frozen]] to the other
; Anti-slider : Synonymous with [[#G|gripper]]
; Arena ice : Temporary curling ice made quickly on a hockey rink or the like, most often used by curling clubs without dedicated curling facilities; usually of lower quality than that of a dedicated facility, but when created for televised events or events with large numbers of spectators, the ice quality can rival or even exceed that of a dedicated facility
; Around the horn : A [[#D|double]] or [[#T|triple]] where the shooter ends up coming back up the rings

==B==
; Back 4 : The portion of the [[##|4 foot]] ring behind the tee line
; Back 8 : The portion of the [[##|8 foot]] ring behind the tee line
; Back 12 : The portion of the [[##|12 foot]] ring behind the tee line
; Back board : The border at the extreme ends of the sheet
; Back end : A team's [[#T|third]] and [[#S|skip]], considered as a unit.
; Back-house weight : Delivery speed required for a stone to come to rest in the back half of the house
; Back line : The line right behind the house. If a [[#R|rock]] completely crosses the back line, it is removed from play
; Back of the House : The portion of the house behind the [[#T|tee line]]
; Back ring : Synonymous with [[#B|back 12]]
; Barrier : A board or other object behind the hack, used to stop moving stones; referred to as "[[#B|bumper]]" in Canada
; Barrier weight : Delivery speed that should come to rest against the barrier behind the [[#H|hack]]. Synonymous with board weight.
; Besom : The traditional name for the device used to sweep ahead of a moving stone. A broom.
; Biter : A stone that barely touches the outside of the [[#H|house]], i.e. the 12-foot ring
; Bite stick : A piece of equipment used to determine whether or not a stone is a biter; also known as a 'biter bar'
; Blank end : An end in which no points are scored; in regular play the team that has the hammer retains it for the next end. In [[Skins Game#Curling|skins games]], the skin for a blanked end is carried over. To "blank an end" means to intentionally leave no stones in the house so as to retain the hammer.
; Blanking an end : Deliberately creating a blank end for the purposes of retaining the last rock advantage for the next end of play
; Blast : A shot delivered with heavy weight and high velocity. A blast is usually intended to remove many stones from play or is used to break up and move around clustered stones. "Playing the blast" into a large cluster of stones is often a last resort shot to get the rocks split up when there are no other viable shots available.
; Board weight : Throwing a stone with enough speed that it will come to rest in an area just behind the hacks – about 6 feet behind the house. Synonymous with barrier/bumper weight.
; [[Bonspiel]] : [[Scots language|Scots]] for ''league match'', this is the term used for a curling tournament. Compare "spiel"
; Bounce : A failed corner [[#F|freeze]] where the [[#S|shooter]] rolls [[#O|open]]
; [[Tim Hortons Brier|Brier]] : The Canadian men's curling championship, held annually since 1927
; Broom : An implement with which players sweep the ice to make a stone travel farther and curl less; though brushes have almost completely replaced brooms, the traditional name remains
; Broomstacking : See [[#S|stacking the brooms]]
; Brush / brushing : [[#B|Broom]] / [[#S|Sweeping]]
; Bump : A short [[#R|raise]]
; Bumper : The [[#B|barrier]]
; Bumper weight : Synonymous with barrier/board weight.
; Buried : A [[#R|rock]] that is hidden behind another [[#R|rock]], usually a [[#G|guard]], making it difficult for a [[#C|curler]] to hit with a delivered [[#R|rock]].  Also called "covered"
; Burn : To accidentally touch a moving stone; the opposing skip has the option to remove the burned stone, or leave it where it comes to rest
; Button : The centre (bullseye) of the [[#H|house]]; sometimes called the 1-foot circle

==C==
; Calling the shot : When the skip holds the broom where he/she wants the person delivering the stones to aim. When the skip is delivering, the third calls the shot
; [[Grand Slam of Curling]] : A series of eight premier men’s and women’s events that feature Canada’s deepest and strongest curling fields
; Cashspiel : A tournament with significant entry fees and large prizes, sometimes part of a charity event; despite the large prizes, cashspiels are not the premier events in curling
; CCW : Counter Clockwise (turn of the stone from delivery)
; Centre guard : A [[#G|guard]] that is placed directly on the centre line, in front of the [[#H|house]]; usually played by the team that does not have the hammer
; Centre line : A line running lengthwise down the centre of the ice, used as a visual aid; some sheets do not have a centre line, or do not have one between the [[#H|hog lines]]
; {{vanchor|Chip}} : A takeout that hits a [[#R|rock]] at an angle
; Chip and lie  / chip and roll : When a played stone strikes the edge of another stone and moves to another position in play
; Christmas Tree : Series of rocks in the house arrayed from front to back in such a way that a corner of each successive rock is visible from the hack, angling out like the edge of a Christmas tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/cbccolleenjones/status/825863275183276035|title=ColleenJonescbc on Twitter|newspaper=Twitter|language=en|access-date=2017-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Chroming the Rock : Grazing a stationary stone without significantly moving it; but enough to alter the path of the shooting rock {{citation needed|date=January 2015}} 
; Circus shot : A flashy but low-percentage shot.  Also [[#T|Trick shot]]
; Clean : To brush the ice lightly in front of a moving rock to remove any debris and ensure a correct line; less vigorous than a [[#S|sweep]]
; Club : The location of the curling rink; most players usually refer to it as "The Club"
; Come-around : Any shot that curls around another rock
; Coming home : Going into the final [[#E|end]]
; Control weight: A takeout shot that is slow enough that the sweepers have relative control over its curl; faster than board weight, but slower than normal takeout weight
; Corner guard : A type of [[#G|guard]] that is off to the side of the house; usually employed when a team has the hammer and needs to score multiple points
; Counter : A stone in the house lying closer to the centre than any of the opponent's stones. Each counter scores one point at the completion of an end.
; Cover : Protection given to a rock by a rock in front of it
; Curl : Movement of a moving rock away from a straight line; as a verb, to play at curling
; Curler : General term for player involved in a curling team; also known as a "soofter" in the [[UK]]
; Curling : A team sport which involves sliding granite [[#S|stones]] on ice and [[#S|sweeping]] in front of them with [[#B|brooms]] to direct them to desired placements
; Curling club : Synonymous with [[#C|club]]
; Curling pin : A participation souvenir, generally worn on a sweater; there is a sub-culture at any major bonspiel built around trading pins. Most curling clubs and many tournaments produce one, and they are usually not awards
; Curling stick : A device that permits a player to deliver a stone while standing upright; generally used by older players, these are legal in most games.
; CW : Clockwise (turn of the stone from delivery)

==D==
; Dead buried : A rock completely covered by another rock (often a guard) such that no part is visible
; Dead handle : Synonymous with [[#N|no handle]]
; Delivery : Process of throwing a stone
; Deuce : Scoring 2 points in an end
; Die! : A call given by the skip for the sweepers to stop sweeping a rock; a rock that dies is a rock that stops moving
; Dish : State of a sheet of ice where the sides are slightly elevated compared to the center, so that a cross section of the ice would look like a cross section of a dish; this sometimes happens near the end of a week-long tournament because the pebbling motion tends to apply more pebbles to the side, while sweeping during games happens more often near the center and wears down the ice more in that region; when there is a dish, rocks will curl more towards the center and less away from the center
; Double takeout / Double : A takeout shot in which two other stones are removed from play; a shot in which the delivered stone and one other stone are removed is not a double takeout
; Drag : When two rocks are frozen, hitting the top rock at an angle creates a drag effect that affects the direction of the second rock; the friction between the two frozen rocks makes the first rock "drag" the second rock slightly towards the same direction; hitting the top rock on the right makes the bottom rock move more to the left while hitting it on the left makes it move more to the right
; Draw : A shot that lands in play without hitting another stone out, as opposed to a takeout shot. Also refers to a game, e.g., “We have a draw at 7:00 p.m. tonight.”
; Draw raise : A shot in which the played stone pushes a stone straight forward into the house
; Drawmaster : Person who assigns teams to different sheets, sets starting times, assigns players to teams in casual play, etc.
; Draw weight : Delivery speed required for a stone to come to rest in the house
; Dump the handle (also Flip or Turn-Out/Turn-In) : During delivery of a stone, the thrower accidentally pushes the stone off-course with their turning motion; often the result of using the arm to shove the stone, and usually causes a missed shot

==E==
; Easy : Command – called out by the skip to tell the sweepers to ease off their sweeping of a rock but to continue sweeping it lightly and slowly. 
; Eight-ender : An end where all eight stones score for one team – a very rare occurrence.
; End : Similar to an [[inning]] in [[baseball]]; in an end, each team throws 8 rocks, 2 per player in alternating fashion; tournament style games usually run for 10 ends; games played at the club level usually run for 8 ends. Prior to the latter half of the twentieth century, a game consisted of 12 ends played in full.
; Extra end : Equivalent to an extra inning in baseball; in the event of a tie after the prescribed number of ends, extra ends are played until the tie is broken.

==F==
; Fall : A defect in the ice which causes stones thrown in that area to curl negatively
; Falling : As the stone is sliding down the sheet, it curls negatively, i.e., the opposite direction than it is supposed to
; Finish : The amount of sideways movement in the last 3 meters (10 feet) or so of a rock's path; can be used as a verb ("it needs to finish") or a noun ("there's lots of finish in that spot")
; Firm weight : Something more than [[#N|Normal weight]] but less than [[#P|Peel weight]]
; Flash : To completely miss an attempted takeout; the rock passes through the house without touching any rocks at all
; Fourth : The player throwing the last two rocks for a team; since the skip almost always throws the last two rocks, this term is rarely used
; Free-Guard Zone : Area between the [[#H|hog line]] and the [[#T|tee line]], excluding the [[#H|house]]. Evolved from the [[Free guard zone|Moncton Rule]].
; Free-Guard Zone Rule : The rule that states that an opponent's rock resting in the free-guard zone cannot be removed from play until the first four rocks of an end have been played
; Freeze : A precise draw weight shot where a delivered stone comes to rest against a stationary stone, making it nearly impossible to knock out
; Front end : A team's [[#L|lead]] and [[#S|second]], considered as a unit
; Front-house weight : Delivery speed required for a stone to come to rest in the front half of the house
; Front of the House : The portion of the house closer to the [[#H|hog line]]
; Front ring: Synonymous with [[#T|top 12]]
; Frost : Buildup that can occur on ice surfaces when there is excessive humidity in the air; tends to makes stones stop faster and curl less
; Fun Spiel : Bonspiel oriented to recreational/fun play, often shorter duration games, and may have unusual formats

==G==
; Guard : A rock that is placed in front of another rock to protect it from being knocked out by the other team, or placed with the intent to later curl another rock around it and thus be protected; typically placed between the hog line and the very front of the [[#H|house]]
; Gripper : A rubber or other material attached to a curling shoe to improve traction on the ice; also known as an ''anti-slider''; see [[#S|Slider]]

==H==
; Hack : Similar to a starting block in [[track and field]], the foothold device where the person who throws the rock pushes off for delivery
; Hack weight : The weight required to deliver a stone in order that it travels to the hack at the far end
; Hackweight takeout : A slower played takeout that, because of the reduced speed, curls more and therefore can reach opponent stones that are hidden behind a [[#G|guard]]
; Hammer : The last rock in an end – a huge advantage; the team with the last rock is said to "have the hammer"
; Handle : The part of the stone held by the player; used to describe the desired direction of rotation of the handle (and therefore the stone) upon release in a given delivery; "[[#L|Losing the handle]]" refers to a rock which stops curling or which changes direction of curl while moving; See also [[#N|No Handle]], [[#R|Reverse Handle]], [[#S|Straight Handle]].
; Handshake: Each team traditionally shakes hands with each member of the opposing team at the end of a match as a sign of goodwill. Unlike other sports, curlers can, and are often encouraged to, forfeit the game early out of sportsmanship if the score is badly lopsided or if a team runs [[#O|out of stones]]. To signal their forfeit, the losing team shakes the hands of the other team. This can simply be called "shaking", as in "the Smith team shook after 7 ends".
; Hard! : Command – along with "hurry" – shouted by the skip to tell the sweepers to sweep harder and faster
; Heavy : A stone that is thrown harder than required and will probably slide too far
; Heavy ice : Slow ice on which stones take more initial force to travel a similar distance as on fast (keen) ice ''(see keen ice)''
; High side : The high side of a shooter in motion is the side that it is curling away from, ie., the side outside the curve of the shooter's path. To "hit on the high side" is to hit the stationary rock off-centre on the side the shooter came from. &lt;ref name="curling1"&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.curling.ca/blog/2016/02/09/heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-sweeping-in-2016/|title=Here's what you need to know about sweeping in 2016|newspaper=Curling Canada blog|language=en|access-date=2018-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Hit and roll : A takeout rock that, after making contact with another rock, slides (rolls) into a designated area
; Hit and stay : A takeout where the played stone stays in the spot where it made contact with the stationary stone; also called 'hit and stick' or a 'nose hit'
; Hit weight : Another term for take-out weight

; Hog line (far): The line which the stone must completely cross to be considered in play
; Hog line (near): The line by which the stone must be clearly and fully released by the thrower
; Hog line violation : Failure to release a stone before crossing the near hog line; a stone in violation is immediately removed from play
; Hogged rock: A shot that comes to rest short of or on the far hog line and is removed from play
; Hogger : See "hogged rock"
; House : The three concentric circles where points are scored
; Hurry! : see [[#H|hard!]] (often said together: "hurry hard!")

==I==
; Ice (more, less, too much, not enough) : Adjustment to the crosswise distance between the skip's broom and the desired target area; for example, a player who feels that the skip's broom is too close to the target might request "more ice"
; Icemaker :Person who is responsible for maintaining the ice; duties include, but are not limited to, pebbling and scraping the ice
; In-off : A shot where the delivered stone hits another stone near the outer edge of the sheet at an angle, making the shooter roll into the house; one of the most difficult curling shots, usually done as a last resort when there are no other options
; In-turn : A shot in which the handle of the stone is rotated across the body (the elbow is rotated "in" to the body); for a right-handed thrower, an in-turn is clockwise, and the opposite for a lefty
; Inside : Another term for narrow

==K==
; Keen ice : Fast ice on which stones travel greater distances with less force than required for heavy ice ''(see heavy ice)''
; Kizzle kazzle : A delivered stone that is intentionally wobbled to compensate for water, slush or snow on the ice surface

==L==
; Lazy handle : When the rotation of a stone is very slow, i.e., less than one full rotation during the stone's slide; often the result of thrower error, they will usually curl more than a properly delivered stone; may turn into a [[#N|No Handle]] or [[#R|Reverse Handle]]
; Lead : The player who throws the first two rocks for a team
; Lie / Lies / Lying : The [[#C|count]] of the number of stones of one colour closest to the centre of the [[#B|button]], closer than the innermost stone of the other colour.  When a team "lies X" or "is lying X", that number of its stones are, at that moment, closer to the button than any opposition stone; were the [[#E|end]] to finish then, the team would score that number of points.
; Line: The path of a moving stone; a 'good' line indicates it is headed where it was intended to go; a 'bad' line has deviated
; Light : A stone that is not thrown hard enough
; Little rocks: Many clubs offer a Little Rocks program for children, with rocks that are roughly half the weight of regular 44&amp;nbsp;lb. rocks. Curlers generally move onto full-sized rocks around the ages of 10 to 12.
; Losing the handle : A rock that is "losing the handle" refers to a rock which loses its rotation or which reverses its rotation while moving
; Lost turn : Synonymous with [[#N|no handle]]
; Low side : The low side of a shooter in motion is the side that it is curling toward, ie., the side inside the curve of the shooter's path. To "hit on the low side" is to hit the stationary rock off-centre after the shooter crosses its face. &lt;ref name="curling1"/&gt;
; LSFE : Last Stone in the First End; in every other end, the last stone (or [[#H|hammer]]) is determined by the scoring in the previous end. In the first end, some other system (coin toss, draw contest, record comparison) must be used to determine the advantage of the hammer.

==M==
; [[Manitoba tuck]] : A type of delivery, mostly found in [[Manitoba]], where the body is kept very low to the ground and the leading leg is tucked underneath the body and to the side; this type is delivery is particularly efficient for hits but makes draws slightly tougher to execute, with the shoulders not being as straight and the eyes being closer to the ice
; Mate : The player who discusses strategy with the skip behind the house and holds the broom while the skip throws his rocks; usually plays [[#T|third]]; also known as [[#V|vice-skip]] or vice
; Measure stick : Equipment used to determine which of two or more stones is closest to the centre when they are too similar to know with visual inspection

==N==
; Narrow : A stone delivered [[#O|off the broom]] too close to the desired target and therefore likely to curl past it
; Negative ice : A shot in which the player curls the stone in the opposite direction in which the stone is expected to curve, due to significant defects in flatness of the ice surface; for example, if the curvature of the ice causes all stones to drift sharply to the right, a skip may request the shooter to aim to the left of the desired location and curve the stone to the left as well.
; Never : Called during the sweep to indicate the stone needs to curl and the sweepers should stay off the rock
; Nice weight: A term used by some Manitoba teams, similar to Control weight
; No handle : A rock delivered without a turn, usually done in error; stones thrown without a handle often follow an unpredictable path
; Normal weight: Normal takeout weight; faster than control weight, but slower than [[#P|peel]]
; Nose: The point on a rock closest to the shooter. A "nose hit" would be hitting the rock at this point, avoiding a roll.

==O==
; Off! : A call given by the skip for the sweepers to stop sweeping a rock
; Off the broom : An incorrectly aimed shot; opposite of ''on the broom''
; Open : A rock that is not obscured by another rock from the shooter's perspective; a skip will often ask the shooter how "open" a certain rock appears from the hack, with the rock being totally open, partially obscured (such as "half open") or completely covered; also, a term for any shot not involving going around a guard: an open takeout, an open draw, etc.
; On the broom : A correctly aimed shot that starts out directly at the broom held by the skip; opposite of ''off the broom''
; Out of stones : A situation in which a team that is behind in the score no longer has enough stones between those in play and those yet to be played to make up the deficit; the outcome is now certain, and the game usually ends with a [[#H|handshake]] once a team is out of stones.
; Outside : Another term for [[#W|wide]]
; Out-turn : A shot in which the handle of the stone is rotated away from the body &amp;ndash; the elbow is rotated "out" from the body; for a right-handed thrower, an out-turn is counter-clockwise, and the opposite for a lefty

==P==
; Pancake : A [[#R|rock]]
; Pebble : Small droplets of water intentionally sprayed on the ice that cause irregularities on the surface, allowing the rocks to curl. Also a verb; the action of depositing water droplets on the ice, as "to pebble the ice between games"

; Peel weight : A stone delivered with a heavy takeout weight
; Pick : When a rock's running surface travels over a foreign particle such as a hair, causing the rock to deviate from its expected path, usually by increasing friction and thereby the amount of curl

; Raise takeout : A shot in which the delivered stone bumps a second stone which in turn knocks a third stone out of play. Also called a runback
; Reading the ice : When a curler considers how the condition of a sheet of ice will influence the path of a thrown stone, similar to how a golfer reads the undulations and texture of a green before determining where and how hard to hit a putt
; Reverse handle : When a stone is thrown with a particular turn, but it eventually stops and begins to rotate in the opposite direction; usually the result of a [[#P|pick]] or poor ice conditions. Sometimes it may even reverse twice in one shot, creating unpredictable shots that follow an S-shaped path.
; Right off! : A call given by the skip to tell the sweepers to neither sweep nor clean the rock; as compared to [[#O|off!]], which tells the sweepers to stop sweeping but not necessarily to stop cleaning

; Tick : A shot that bumps a [[#G|guard]] out of the way without removing it from play, to avoid violating the [[#F|Free Guard Zone Rule]]; usually played with lead rocks late in a game to prevent the trailing team from setting up a [[#S|steal]]
; Tight : Another term for [[#N|narrow]]
; Time: At professional levels sweepers use a timer to measure the time between the start of the delivery and the rock hitting the hog line, and will then call out that time as an indicator of the shot's weight. "Time" can also refer to the amount of time left on the game clock

The '''Hapee Fresh Fighters'''  was a basketball team owned by Lamoiyan Corporation that played in the [[PBA Developmental League]] (PBA D-League). 

The franchise began in the [[Philippine Basketball League]] from 1994 until the league became dormant in 2010.  The franchise was revived in 2014 when it took over the franchise of the [[NLEX Road Warriors (PBA D-League)|NLEX Road Warriors]] in the PBA D-League.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lamoiyan.com/index.php?mod=press_releases&amp;id=91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Badua|first1=Snow|title=Hapee days here again as Cecilio Pedro team set to take over NLEX franchise in D-League|url=http://www.spin.ph/basketball/news/hapee-days-here-again-as-cecilio-pedro-team-set-to-take-over-nlex-franchise-in-d-leagu|website=SPIN.ph|publisher=SPIN.ph|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team has forged a school tie-up with [[San Beda College]] for its participation in the PBA D-League.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1423">'''Holland Municipal Stadium''' was a 5,322-seat [[American football]] stadium located in [[Holland, Michigan]].  Built in 1979, Hope College purchased Holland Municipal Stadium from the City of Holland in 2012 and renamed the facility, where the Flying Dutchmen plays, Ray &amp; Sue Smith Stadium. Ray &amp; Sue Smith Stadium is also used regularly for [[high school]] football, including the hometown team, Holland High School.  The stadium features two concession stands, restrooms, and a press box.  It is adjacent to a municipal [[swimming pool]]; the stadium shares locker room facilities with the pool.

Hope College built the adjacent Lugers Fieldhouse in 1991.  The Flying Dutchmen's locker rooms are located there, as are locker rooms for other sports and a sports medicine center.

It is also used for [[graduation]] ceremonies and other special events, including [[fireworks]] and the [[Tulip Time Festival]].

The '''"hot hand"''' (also known as the '''"hot hand phenomenon"''' or '''"hot hand fallacy"''') is the purported phenomenon that a person who experiences a successful outcome with a [[Randomness|random]] event has a greater [[probability]] of success in further attempts. The concept is often applied to sports and skill-based tasks in general and originates from [[basketball]], whereas a shooter is allegedly more likely to score if their previous attempts were successful, i.e. while having "hot hands". While previous success at a task can indeed change the [[Psychology|psychological]] attitude and subsequent success rate of a player, researchers for many years did not find evidence for a "hot hand" in practice, dismissing it as [[fallacy|fallacious]]. However, later research questioned whether the belief is indeed a fallacy.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/working-papers/hot-hand-fallacy-cognitive-mistakes-or-equilibrium-adjustments|title=The Hot Hand Fallacy: Cognitive Mistakes or Equilibrium Adjustments?

A Truth in the Law of Small Numbers |journal=IGIER Working Paper| number=552|doi=10.2139/ssrn.2627354}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies using modern statistical analysis show there is evidence for the "hot hand" in some sporting activities.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

== Development of theory ==

=== 1985 "Hot Hand in Basketball" paper ===
The fallacy was first described in a 1985 paper by [[Amos Tversky]], [[Thomas Gilovich]], and Robert Vallone. The "Hot Hand in Basketball" study questioned the theory that basketball players have "hot hands", which the paper defined as the claim that players are more likely to make a successful shot if their previous shot was successful. The study looked at the inability of respondents to properly understand [[randomness]] and random events; much like [[innumeracy]] can impair a person's judgement of statistical information, the hot hand fallacy can lead people to form incorrect assumptions regarding random events. The three researchers provide an example in the study regarding the "coin toss"; respondents expected even short sequences of heads and tails to be approximately 50% heads and 50% tails.&lt;ref name="Gilovich1985"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gilovich|first=Thomas |author2=Tversky, A. |author3=Vallone, R.|title=The Hot Hand in Basketball: On the Misperception of Random Sequences|journal=Cognitive Psychology|year=1985|volume=17|issue=3|pages=295–314|doi=10.1016/0010-0285(85)90010-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study proposed two biases that are created by the kind of thought pattern applied to the coin toss: it could lead an individual to believe that the probability of heads or tails increases after a long sequence of either has occurred (known as the [[gambler's fallacy]]); or it could cause an individual to reject randomness due to a belief that a streak of either outcome is not representative of a random sample.&lt;ref name="Gilovich1985" /&gt;

The first study was conducted via a questionnaire of 100 basketball fans from the colleges of [[Cornell University|Cornell]] and [[Stanford University|Stanford]]. The other looked at the individual records of players from the [[1980–81 Philadelphia 76ers season|1980–81 Philadelphia 76ers]]. The third study analyzed free-throw data and the fourth study was of a controlled shooting experiment. The reason for the different studies was to gradually eliminate external factors around the shot. For example, in the first study there is the factor of how the opposing team's [[Basketball playbook|defensive strategy]] and shot selection would interfere with the shooter. The second and third take out the element of shot selection, and the fourth eliminates the game setting and the distractions and other external factors mentioned before. The studies primarily found that the outcomes of both field goal and free throw attempts are [[independence (probability theory)|independent]] of each other.&lt;ref name="Gilovich1985" /&gt; In the later studies involving the controlled shooting experiment the results were the same; evidently, the researchers concluded that the sense of being "hot" does not predict hits or misses.&lt;ref name="Gilovich1985" /&gt;

=== Proposed explanations ===
Gilovich offers two different explanations for why people believe hot hands exist. The first is that a person may be [[bias]]ed towards looking for streaks before watching a basketball game. This bias would then affect their perceptions and recollection of the game ([[confirmation bias]]). The second explanation deals with people's inability to recognize chance sequences. People expect chance sequences to alternate between the options more than they actually do. Chance sequences can seem too lumpy, and are thus dismissed as non-chance ([[clustering illusion]]).

There are many proposed explanations for why people are susceptible to the hot-hand fallacy. Alan D. Castel, and others investigated the idea that age would alter an individual's belief in the fallacy.&lt;ref name="Castel2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Castel|first=Alan |author2=Drolet Rossi, A. |author3=McGIllivary, S.|title=Beliefs About the "Hot Hand" in Basketball Across the Adult Life Span|journal=Psychology and Agin|volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=601–605 |year=2012|doi=10.1037/a0026991}}&lt;/ref&gt; To test this idea researchers conducted a cross-sectional study where they sampled 455 participants ranging in age from 22 to 90 years old. These participants were given a questionnaire preceded by a prompt that said in college and professional basketball games no players make 100% of their attempted shots.&lt;ref name="Castel2012" /&gt; Then the questionnaire asked two important questions: (1) Does a basketball player have a better chance of making a shot after having just made the last two or three shots than after having missed the last two or three shots? (2) Is it important to pass the ball to someone who has just made several shots in a row?&lt;ref name="Castel2012" /&gt;

The main interest of the questionnaire was to see if a participant answered yes to the first question, implying that they believed in the hot-hand fallacy. The results showed that participants over 70 years of age were twice as likely to believe the fallacy than adults 40–49,&lt;ref name="Castel2012" /&gt; confirming that the older individuals relied more on heuristic-based processes. Older adults are more likely to remember positive information, making them more sensitive to gains and less to losses than younger adults.&lt;ref name="Castel2012" /&gt;

One study looked at the root of the hot-hand fallacy as being from an inability to appropriately judge sequences. The study compiled research from dozens of behavioral and cognitive studies that examined the hot-hand and gambler's fallacies with random mechanisms and skill-generated streaks. In terms of judging random sequences the general conclusion was that people do not have a statistically correct concept of random.&lt;ref name="whats next"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oskarsson|first=Van Boven|title=What's Next? Judging Sequences of Binary Events|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=2009|volume=135|issue=2|pages=262–285|doi=10.1037/a0014821|pmid=19254080}}&lt;/ref&gt; It concluded that human beings are built to see patterns in sensory and conceptual data of all types.&lt;ref name="whats next" /&gt;

=== Follow up studies ===
A 2003 study by Koehler, J. J. &amp; Conley C. A. was conducted to examine the hot hand in professional basketball. In this study the researchers examined film from the NBA shooting contests from 1994–1997. Through studying the film of the contests the researchers hoped to find evidence of sequential dependency within each shooter across all shots. They also searched for sequential dependencies within each shooter per set of 25 continuous shots, and employed a variety of novel techniques for isolating hot performance.&lt;ref name="refmyth"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koehler|first=Jonathan|year=2003|title=The "Hot Hand" Myth in Professional Basketball|journal=Journal of Sport Psychology|volume=2|issue=25|pages=253–259}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the hot hand a player should have very few runs and instead their hits and misses should be in clusters.

In their research there were only two players who had a significantly lower number of runs than expected by chance. No shooter had significantly more runs than would be expected by chance. About half of the shooters (12 of 23 = 52%) had fewer runs than expected, and about half (11 of 23 = 48%) had more runs than expected.&lt;ref name="refmyth" /&gt; The researchers also compared the shooters hits and misses. The data were more in accordance with chance than the hot hand. Through their analysis of the data the conclusion was drawn that there was nothing that supported the hot hand [[hypothesis]].

A study reported that a belief in the hot-hand fallacy affects a player's [[perception]]s of success.&lt;ref name="ref2"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Raab, M., Gula, B., &amp; Gigerenzer, G. (2011) | journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied | volume=18 | pages=81–94 | doi=10.1037/a0025951| year=2012 | last1=Raab | first1=Markus | last2=Gula | first2=Bartosz | last3=Gigerenzer | first3=Gerd }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent research in support of hot hand ==
More recent research has questioned the earlier findings, instead finding support for the belief of a hot hand phenomenon.

A 2003 paper from researchers at [[Monash University]] noted that Gilovich et al. did not examine the [[statistical power]] of their own experiments. By performing power analysis on the 1985 data, the researchers concluded that even if the Philadelphia 76ers did shoot in streaks, it is highly unlikely that Gilovich, Vallone and Tversky would have discovered that fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~korb/iccs.pdf |title=The Story of The Hot Hand: Powerful Myth or Powerless Critique? |first=Kevin B. |last=Korb |first2=Michael |last2=Stillwell |year=2003 |work= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927050854/http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~korb/iccs.pdf |archivedate=2013-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A paper from October 2011 by Yaari and Eisenmann, a large dataset of more than 300,000 NBA free throws were found to show "strong evidence" for the "hot hand" phenomenon at the individual level. They analyzed all free throws taken during five regular NBA seasons from 2005 to 2010. They found that there was a significant increase in players' probabilities of hitting the second shot in a two-shot series compared to the first one. They also found that in a set of two consecutive shots, the probability of hitting the second shot is greater following a hit than following a miss on the previous one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0024532| pmid = 21998630| title = The Hot (Invisible?) Hand: Can Time Sequence Patterns of Success/Failure in Sports Be Modeled as Repeated Random Independent Trials?| journal = PLoS ONE| volume = 6| issue = 10| pages = e24532| year = 2011| last1 = Yaari | first1 = G. | last2 = Eisenmann | first2 = S. | bibcode = 2011PLoSO...624532Y | pmc=3187751}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013, researchers at Stanford University used data from [[Major League Baseball]] and found that there was "strong evidence" that the hot hand existed in ten different statistical categories.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

In 2014, a paper from three Harvard graduates presented at the Sloan Sports Analytics Conference, which used advanced statistics that for the first time could control for variables in basketball games such as the player's shot location and a defender's position, showed a "small yet significant hot-hand effect."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304071004579409071015745370|title=Does the 'Hot Hand' Exist in Basketball?|last=Cohen|first=Ben|date=2014-02-27|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, an examination of the 1985 study by Joshua Miller and Adam Sanjurjo found flaws in the methodology of the 1985 study and showed that, in fact, the hot hands may exist. The researchers said that instead it may be attributable to a misapplication of statistical techniques.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; The authors concluded that people were right to believe that the hot hand exists in basketball.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

== Hot hand in non-sport contexts ==

=== Consumers ===
There are places other than sport that can be affected by the hot-hand fallacy. A study conducted by Joseph Johnson et al. examined the characteristics of an individual's buying and selling behavior as it pertained to the hot hand and gambler's heuristic. Both of these occur when a consumer misunderstands random events in the market and is influenced by a belief that a small sample is able to represent the underlying process.&lt;ref name="Johnson2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Joseph|author2=Tellis, G.J. |author3=Macinnis, D.J. |title=Losers, Winners, and Biased Trades|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|year=2005|volume=2|issue=32|pages=324–329|doi=10.1086/432241}}&lt;/ref&gt; To examine the effect of the hot hand and gambler's heuristic on the buying and selling behaviors of consumers, three hypotheses were made. Hypothesis one stated that consumers that were given stocks with positive and negative trends in earning would be more likely to buy a stock that was positive when it was first getting started but would become less likely to do so as the trend lengthened. Hypothesis two was that consumers would be more likely to sell a stock with negative earnings as the trend length initially increased but would decrease as the trend length increased more. Finally, the third hypothesis was that consumers in the buy condition would be more likely to choose a winning stock over those in the selling condition.&lt;ref name="Johnson2005" /&gt;

The results of the experiment did not support the first hypothesis but did support hypotheses two and three, suggesting that the use of these heuristics is dependent on buying or selling and the length of the sequence.&lt;ref name="Johnson2005" /&gt; This means that those who had the shorter length and the buying condition would fall under the influence of the hot-hand fallacy. The opposite would be in accordance with the [[gambler's fallacy]] which has more of an influence on longer sequences of numerical information.

=== Gambling ===
A study was conducted to examine the difference between the hot-hand and [[gambler's fallacy]]. The gambler's fallacy is the expectation of a reversal following a run of one outcome.&lt;ref name="sympathetic magic"&gt;{{cite journal | title= Roney, C. R., Trick, L. M. (2009)| journal= Sympathetic magic and perceptions of randomness: the hot hand versus the gambler's fallacy | volume= 15 | issue= 2 | pages= 197–210 |doi=10.1080/13546780902847137| year= 2009 | last1= Roney | first1= Christopher J. R. | last2= Trick | first2= Lana M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gambler's fallacy occurs mostly in cases in which people feel that an event is random, such as rolling a pair of dice on a [[craps]] table or spinning the [[roulette]] wheel. It is caused by the false belief that the random numbers of a small sample will balance out the way they do in large samples; this is known as the law of small numbers heuristic. The difference between this and the hot-hand fallacy is that with the hot-hand fallacy an individual expects a run to continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Raab|first=Markus|author2=Gula, B. |author3=Gigerenzer, G. |title=The Hot hand Exists in Volleyball and Is Used for Allocation Decisions|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied|year=2011|volume=18|issue=1|pages=81–94|doi=10.1037/a0025951}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a much larger aspect of the hot hand that relies on the individual. This relates to a person's perceived ability to predict random events, which is not possible for truly random events. The fact that people believe that they have this ability is in line with the [[illusion of control]].&lt;ref name="sympathetic magic" /&gt;

In this study, the researchers wanted to test if they could manipulate a [[Coin flipping|coin toss]], and counter the gambler's fallacy by having the participant focus on the person tossing the coin. In contrast, they attempted to initiate the hot-hand fallacy by centering the participant's focus on the person tossing the coin as a reason for the streak of either heads or tails. In either case the data should fall in line with [[sympathetic magic]], whereby they feel that they can control the outcomes of random events in ways that defy the [[Physical law|laws of physics]], such as being "hot" at tossing a specific randomly determined outcome.&lt;ref name="sympathetic magic" /&gt;

They tested this concept under three different conditions. The first was person focused, where the person who tossed the coin mentioned that ''she'' was tossing a lot of heads or tails. Second was a coin focus, where the person who tossed the coin mentioned that ''the coin'' was coming up with a lot of heads or tails. Finally there was a control condition in which there was nothing said by the person tossing the coin.&lt;ref name="sympathetic magic" /&gt; The participants were also assigned to different groups, one in which the person flipping the coin changed and the other where the person remained the same.

The researchers found the results of this study to match their initial hypothesis that the gambler's fallacy could in fact be countered by the use of the hot hand and people's attention to the person who was actively flipping the coin. It is important to note that this counteraction of the gambler's fallacy only happened if the person tossing the coin remained the same.&lt;ref name="sympathetic magic" /&gt; This study shed light on the idea that the gambler's and hot hand fallacies at times fight for dominance when people try to make predictions about the ''same'' event.&lt;ref name="sympathetic magic" /&gt;

The '''Italian Basketball Hall of Fame''' ({{lang-it|Italia Basket Hall of Fame}}, IBHOF) is a [[hall of fame]] that honours individuals (or whole teams) that have contributed to the spread and improvement of Italian [[basketball]], through their sporting contributions, their behaviour and their actions in support of the game in [[Italy]].&lt;ref name=Mission&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fip.it/halloffame/DocumentoNoList.asp?IDCartella=1698 |title=Mission - il più alto riconoscimento della Fip |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=[[Federazione Italiana Pallacanestro|FIP]].it |access-date=13 September 2015 |language=Italian |trans-title=Mission - the highest honour from FIP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Federazione Italiana Pallacanestro|Italian Basketball Federation]] has inducted a class every year since 2007 (counting for the previous year) with an official ceremony that crowns athletes (male and female), coaches, referees or other figureheads who have contributed to Italian basketball, with a maximum of seven inductees per yer (teams exempted). 
Those also in the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame|Naismith Hall of Fame]] or the [[FIBA Hall of Fame]] are not limited in number, in addition, two individuals who are deceased at most can also be inducted in memoriam yearly.&lt;ref name=Mission /&gt;

==History==
The Hall of Fame was established by the [[Federazione Italiana Pallacanestro|Italian Basketball Federation]] (FIP) on 16 September 2006, with the first class (that of 2006) inducted on 11 February 2007 in [[Bologna]]. [[Sandro Riminucci]], who broke a [[Lega Basket Serie A|LBA]] record with 77 points in 1963, [[Sandro Gamba]], who had a hand in defeating the [[Soviet Union national basketball team]] at the [[Basketball at the 1980 Summer Olympics|1980 Olympics]], [[Gianfranco Lombardi|Dado Lombardi]] and [[Paolo Vittori]] were honoured, as well as [[Cesare Rubini]] (a [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame|Naismith Hall of Fame]] member like Gamba) and [[Dino Meneghin]] (in both the Naismith and [[FIBA Hall of Fame]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fip.it/halloffame/DocumentoNoList.asp?IDCartella=485 |title=Classe 2006.

The 2008 class, inducted in Bologna on 22 February 2009, saw former [[Virtus Pallacanestro Bologna|Virtus Bologna]] [[head coach]] [[Ettore Messina]] amongst the inductees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fiba.com/news/ITA---New-class-inducted-for-Italia-Basket-Hall-of-Fame |title=ITA – New class inducted for Italia Basket Hall of Fame |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=23 February 2009 |website=[[FIBA]].com |location=Bologna |access-date=13 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2014 class, inducted in [[Rome]] on 23 March 2015, had a number of former [[Pallacanestro Varese]] members; [[Antonio Bulgheroni]] was crowned for his career both as Varese player (winning three LBA titles) and president (adding the 1999 title to become the only person to have won both as player and president), whilst [[Marino Zanatta]] and [[Fabrizio Della Fiori]] were honoured for their playing contributions to their [[sports club|clubs]] and the senior [[Italian national basketball team]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pallacanestrovarese.it/bulgheroni-zanatta-e-della-fiori-nella-italia-basket-hall-of-fame/ |title=Bulgheroni, Zanatta e Della Fiori nella Italia Basket Hall of Fame |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=23 March 2015 |website=[[Pallacanestro Varese|PallacanestroVarese]].it |access-date=13 September 2015 |language=Italian |trans-title=Bulgheroni, Zanatta and Della Fiori in the Italian Basket Hall of Fame}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Luta Livre''' ({{IPA-pt|ˈlutɐ ˈlivɾi|lang}}, lit. ''freestyle fighting''), also referred as '''Luta Livre Brasileira''' or '''Luta Livre Submissa''', is a Brazilian martial art created by [[Euclydes Hatem]].&lt;ref name="LL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lutalivre.net/home126.html|title=Andyconda Luta Livre - the art of grappling and MMA - Luta-Livre brazilian Grappling and MMA|work=lutalivre.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lutalivre-academy.de/publications/articles/the-development-of-luta-livre-and-vale-tudo-in-brazil-part-ii-1/|title=RFT Deutschland - The development of Luta Livre and Vale Tudo in Brazil. Part II|publisher=|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bleacher"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/653980-history-of-jiu-jitsu-baptism-by-fire-and-luta-livre|title=History of Jiu Jitsu: Baptism By Fire and Luta Livre|author=Tom|work=Bleacher Report|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2009/1/10/710938/mma-history-xviii-the-loss|title=MMA History XVIII: The Losses of Luta Livre|author=Nate Wilcox|work=Bloody Elbow|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Rio de Janeiro.  Primarily a mixture of [[catch wrestling]] and [[judo]], there is also [[Strike (attack)|striking]] with the hands, feet, knees and elbows.  Notable practitioners include [[Marco Ruas]], [[Ebenezer Fontes Braga]], [[Johil de Oliveira]], [[Alexandre Franca Nogueira]], [[Renato Sobral]], [[Darren Till]] and [[José Aldo]].

There are two styles: ''esportiva'' ("sporting") and ''[[vale tudo]]'' ("anything goes"); both styles are [[no-gi]].  In ''esportiva'' competitions, grappling techniques are the only techniques allowed to subdue the opponent.  Consequently, it is important to calmly strategize and execute moves with the aim to force the opponent to submit via [[armlock]], [[leglock]], [[chokehold|choke]] or [[necklock]], or to [[points decision|win by points]] (i.e. [[Takedown (grappling)|takedowns]], domination position).&lt;ref name="LL"/&gt; Punches, kicks and other "hard" techniques are not allowed as this is considered more a sport than actual combat.  ''Vale tudo'', on the other hand, includes techniques in the clinch as well as on the ground; punches and kicks are allowed, but the ground fight and submissions are still the largest elements.  This is also the form used in [[Mixed martial arts|MMA]]-style fights.

==History==
Luta Livre's founder is credited to be [[Euclydes Hatem|Euclydes "Tatu" Hatem]], who was originally a [[catch wrestling|catch wrestler]].  Euclydes Hatem went by the name of Tatu. [http://martialarts.about.com/od/styles/a/lutalivre.htm]  He began teaching catch wrestling techniques to others in [[Rio de Janeiro]] in 1927 while experimenting with some of his own innovative techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amithakim.com/49279/The-Founder-Tatu|title=讛讗转专 讛专砖诪讬 砖诇 注诪讬转 讞讻讬诐 - The Founder - Tatu|work=amithakim.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826115958/http://www.amithakim.com/49279/The-Founder-Tatu|archivedate=2014-08-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tatu brought on many challenges with the Braziliian Jiujitsu and culminated with his victory over George Gracie in the Catch rules fight.The style emphasized fighting without a gi/uniform. He received popularity when he submitted George Gracie in 1940 and when one of his students, [[Euclides Pereira]] defeated [[Carlson Gracie]] in 1968.&lt;ref name="bloodyelbow.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2009/1/10/710938/mma-history-xviii-the-loss|title=MMA History XVIII: The Losses of Luta Livre|work=Bloody Elbow}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system focused on [[ground fighting]] and submissions due to their importance in [[Vale Tudo]] matches.  The groundfighting included the use of leg locks, which at the time was ignored by Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.&lt;ref name="Bleacher"/&gt;  For years, Luta Livre was extremely popular in Brazil, second only to Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. [http://www.fightmagazine.com/mma-magazine/back-to-brazil-2104/] Some of the famous fighters that came out of Luta Livre included William Porfirio.&lt;ref name="Sher"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sherdog.com/fighter/William-Porfirio-15725|title=William|work=Sherdog|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1970s Luta Livre was strongly influenced by father and son duo Fausto and Carlos Brunocilla. The Brunocilla were Tatu's pupils and were in turn responsible for graduating many Luta Livre Masters.  Also around the 1970s, the art of Luta Livre was influenced by [[Roberto Leitão]], a practitioner of judo and wrestling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bjjee.com/articles/history-of-luta-livre-reasons-for-lack-of-mainstream-popularity/|title=History Of Luta Livre &amp; Reasons For Lack Of "Mainstream" Popularity|work=Bjj Eastern Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leitao also articulated the "Theory of Grappling", sometimes referred to as "Theory of Luta Livre".&lt;ref name="bloodyelbow.com"/&gt; Roberto Leitao was a University professor of Engineering{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} who had devoted many years to [[Wrestling]] and Judo.

==Luta Livre and Brazilian jiu-jitsu==
Luta Livre, in its early days, was largely considered to be an art "for poor kids who could not afford a gi." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2012/3/11/2848189/mma-origins-brazilian-warfare-MMA-History|title=MMA Origins: Brazilian Warfare|author=T.P. Grant|work=Bloody Elbow|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  due to appearances since they didn't fight with a [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu gi|gi]]. Luta Livre and BJJ were considered to be enemies.  When Euclides Perreria beat Carlson Gracie in 1968 {{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}, the rivalry was continued for a few more decades.   It was actually very popular amongst kids from the favelas. [http://sports.espn.go.com/extra/mma/columns/story?id=6085794] Luta Livre focused on teaching the poor who were primarily of African descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/653980-history-of-jiu-jitsu-baptism-by-fire-and-luta-livre|title=History of Jiu Jitsu: Baptism By Fire and Luta Livre|author=Tom|work=Bleacher Report}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was opposed to Brazilian Jiujitsu which was thought to focus on teaching of the upper class, who were primarily light skinned.&lt;ref name="Bleacher"/&gt; The battles between the two arts was essentially a class warfare.&lt;ref name="bloodyelbow.com1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2012/3/18/2882727/video-bjj-jiu-jitsu-vs-luta-livre-desafio-matches-rivalry-bustamante-ismail-maia-tadeu-gurgel-maia|title=Video: The Three Historic Challenge Matches From Desafio - Jiu-Jitsu Vs. Luta Livre|work=Bloody Elbow}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1980s, [[Gracie Jiu-Jitsu]] had become very popular in [[Brazil]] and Luta Livre representatives wanted to help popularize their art by accepting challenges from Brazilian jiu-jitsu champions in [[Vale Tudo]] and Submission matches. Luta Livre continued on with many famous fights in and out of the ring.  This included a fight with [[Rickson Gracie]] on the beaches of Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/extra/mma/columns/story?id=6085794|title=Brazil versus Brazil, MMA's most intense rivalry|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would hurt Luta Livre's reputation with [[Hugo Duarte]] losing to [[Rickson Gracie]] then getting knocked out by [[Tank Abbott]] at [[UFC 17]] and [[Eugenio Tadeu]] losing to [[Wallid Ismael]] due to his inability to re-enter the ring in time. Tadeu did battle [[Royler Gracie]] to a draw in an indoor fight.  Another fight between [[Renzo Gracie]] and Eugenio Tadeu kept the rivalry going. [http://sports.espn.go.com/extra/mma/columns/story?id=6085794] His battle with [[Renzo Gracie]] in 1997 ended in a No Contest due to fans rioting. In 1991 [[Desafio]] hosted a Jiu-Jitsu vs Luta Livre card that had three representatives of Brazilian jiu-jitsu up against three representatives of Luta Livre, with BJJ winning all three fights.&lt;ref name="bloodyelbow.com1"/&gt;

'''Market Square Arena''' was an [[indoor arena]] in [[Indianapolis]]. Completed in 1974, at a cost of $23 million, it seated 16,530 for [[basketball]] and 15,993 for [[ice hockey]]. Seating capacity for concerts and other events was adjusted by the use of large curtains which sealed off the upper rows.

==History==
In the late 1960s, the city of Indianapolis studied several market areas of the city for future development and revitalization. Students from the fourth-year design studio class at [[Ball State University College of Architecture and Planning]] met with the City of Indianapolis to review and select 20–26 projects for consideration. Students Joseph Mynhier and Terry Pastorino selected downtown Indianapolis as their market and designed what would become Market Square Arena. The design envisioned by Mynhier and Pastorino was later selected and used as a promotional tool by the City of Indianapolis for construction of the stadium. The city selected four architectural firms to complete the arena design with two representatives from each of the four companies. Terry Pastorino, who had worked for Kennedy, Brown &amp; Trueblood, Inc., during the summer of 1970 on the project, later joined the firm working on the arena.

The original student design included a four-story office building covering two city blocks. The Market Square Arena as constructed consisted of a unique space frame design spanning Market Street. The playing floor was elevated over Market Street by a parking garage on each side of Market Street. Market Street terminated at Market Square Arena to the east and to the west by the capitol. The final design eventually took up one city block spanning Market Street.

Market Square Arena's original center-hung scoreboard was an American Sign and Indicator scoreboard similar to those which would be installed at [[Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum]] and [[Joe Louis Arena]].  Its replacement, a center-hung White Way Sign scoreboard with a color matrix screen on each side (the AS&amp;I scoreboard had monochrome matrix screens), was installed in time for the [[1985 NBA All-Star Game]] and remained at the arena for the rest of its life, where it would later be complimented by front-projection video screens on each end of the arena (complete with [[RCA]] projectors).

===Demolition===
The Pacers moved to the new [[Conseco Fieldhouse]] for the [[1999–2000 NBA season]], and Market Square Arena was demolished on July 8, 2001, in a multimillion-dollar implosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www2.indystar.com/library/MSA/msa09.html|title=Much Relief, Very Little Damage as Implosion Goes Like Clockwork|first=Doug|last=Sword|newspaper=[[Indianapolis Star]]|date=July 8, 2001|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010052947/http://www2.indystar.com/library/MSA/msa09.html|archivedate=October 10, 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It only took 12 seconds to demolish the arena completely.

Prior to the demolition, the basketball court surface was removed. It is now housed at the [[National Institute for Fitness and Sport]] in [[White River State Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fitness Center Facilities|url=http://nifs.web13.hubspot.com/fitness-center/fitness-center-facilities/|work=NIFS website|accessdate=21 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site of the former arena was a parking lot for over a decade. The parking lot held a memorial to [[Elvis Presley]], who played his final concert at MSA on June 26, 1977. The memorial was designed and built by Alan Clough.

In January 2017, [[Cummins]] opened their Global Distribution Headquarters on the southern half of the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cummins cuts ribbon on downtown Indy headquarters|url=http://fox59.com/2017/01/05/cummins-cuts-ribbon-on-downtown-indy-headquarters/|author=McQuaid, Russ|website=[[WXIN|Fox 59]]|date=5 January 2017|accessdate=14 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 28-story apartment building named 360 Market Square and containing a {{convert|40000|sqft|adj=on}} [[Whole Foods Market]] store opened in March 2018, with the Elvis memorial placed on the sidewalk adjacent to the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.indystar.com/story/entertainment/music/2018/06/26/elvis-presley-final-concert-plaque-back-home-revamped-market-street-indianapolis/732048002/|title=You can now find Elvis Presley final-concert plaque amid shiny new spots on Market Street|first=David|last=Lindquist|newspaper=[[Indianapolis Star]]|date=June 27, 2018|accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==
Market Square Arena was best known as the home of the [[Indiana Pacers]] of the [[American Basketball Association]] and [[National Basketball Association]] from 1974 to 1999.

The first Pacers basketball game held in the arena was a preseason game against the [[Milwaukee Bucks]]; attendance was 16,929. The first regular-season ABA game in the arena was held on October 18, 1974, against the [[San Antonio Spurs]]; the Pacers lost in double overtime, 129–121 in front of 7,473 fans. The first Pacers victory in Market Square Arena came on October 23 with a 122–107 win over the [[Spirits of St. Louis]]. The 1974–75 season ended for the Pacers with the ABA Finals played in Market Square Arena and [[Freedom Hall]] against their archrivals, the [[Kentucky Colonels]]. The Colonels defeated the Pacers in that championship series, winning the ABA title in five games (4 wins to 1). The 1975–76 Pacers won their final home ABA game in Market Square Arena with a 109–95 victory against the Colonels. (Kentucky won the next game by one point to win the series and advance, ending the Pacers' ABA tenure.) The Pacers played in Market Square Arena after they joined the NBA. [[Michael Jordan]]'s return to the [[Chicago Bulls]] after his first retirement took place at Market Square Arena in a loss to the Pacers on March 19, 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jumpman23.ch/joc_10_mj_02.jpg |format=JPG |title=Basketball photograph |publisher=Jumpman23.ch |accessdate=2015-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final Pacers game played in Market Square Arena was a pre-season exhibition game against the [[Utah Jazz]] on October 23, 1999.
[[File:Market Square Arena, Indianapolis, 1988.jpg|thumb|left|Market Square Arena in 1988]]
The arena also hosted the [[1980 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1980 NCAA men's basketball Final Four]] &amp; the [[Horizon League|Midwestern Collegiate Conference]] (now Horizon League) men's basketball conference tournament from 1986 to 1988 and again in 1993.

In 1987, Indianapolis hosted the [[1987 Pan American Games|Pan American Games]], and the [[Basketball at the 1987 Pan American Games|basketball event]] was held at Market Square. The gold-medal game pitted Brazil against the United States. The U.S. team of college players featured two All-Americans in [[David Robinson (basketball)|David Robinson]] and [[Danny Manning]], two Final Four MVPs in [[Pervis Ellison]] and [[Keith Smart]], and several other future NBA players. The U.S. team led 68–54 at halftime, but [[Oscar Schmidt]] led Brazil to a stunning comeback, finishing with 46 points as Brazil won 120–115.

Market Square Arena was the primary concert venue for virtually all national and international musical acts visiting Indiana until its demolition in 2001. While many concerts moved to the Deer Creek Music Center amphitheatre during summer months after that venue opened in 1989, Market Square remained the primary concert venue for large acts visiting the city of Indianapolis. Market Square hosted acts from [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Frank Sinatra]] to [[Eric Clapton]], [[Kenny Rogers]], [[Deep Purple]], [[Cheap Trick]], [[Kiss (band)|KISS]], and several Black Expo performances.

Other events held at Market Square included [[circus]]es, [[Ice Capades]], [[monster truck]] shows, indoor [[motocross]] racing, [[rodeo]]s, etc.

Market Square Arena was also the home of the [[Indianapolis Racers]] of the [[World Hockey Association|WHA]] from 1974 to 1979. 17-year-old [[Wayne Gretzky]] starred for the Racers in his first professional action before being traded to the [[Edmonton Oilers]] after a handful of games.

===Notable events===
The first event held at the arena was a [[Glen Campbell]] concert on September 15, 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ballparks.phanfare.com/2414480 |title=Market Square Arena – Indianapolis, Indiana – Ballparks, Arenas and Stadiums – Powered by Phanfare |publisher=Ballparks.phanfare.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518081909/http://www.ballparks.phanfare.com/2414480 |archivedate=2015-05-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Minimalist shoes''' are shoes intended to closely approximate [[barefoot running]] or walking conditions in comparison to traditional shoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=My Shoes Are Killing Me!?|url=https://www.lisbethjoe.com/single-post/2017/10/01/My-Shoes-Are-Killing-Me-Repost-from-Freakonomics|accessdate=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What are Minimalist Running Shoes?|url=http://www.runblogger.com/2011/09/what-are-minimalist-running-shoes.html|accessdate=8 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have reduced cushioning, thin soles, and are of lighter weight than other running shoes, allowing for more sensory contact for the foot on the ground while simultaneously providing the feet with some protection from ground hazards and conditions (such as pebbles and dirt).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.runnersworld.com/running-shoes-gear/barefoot-running|title=Barefoot Running|work=Runner's World}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that wearing a minimalist shoe can help improve foot strength and arch function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=Elizabeth E.|last2=Whitcome|first2=Katherine K.|last3=Lieberman|first3=Daniel E.|last4=Norton|first4=Heather L.|last5=Dyer|first5=Rachael E.|date=2014-06-01|title=The effect of minimal shoes on arch structure and intrinsic foot muscle strength|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095254614000374|journal=Journal of Sport and Health Science|series=Special Issue on “Barefoot and Minimal Shoe Running”|volume=3|issue=2|pages=74–85|doi=10.1016/j.jshs.2014.03.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
Generally, there are two types of minimalist shoes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Barefoot/Minimalist Running Shoes: How to Choose|url=http://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/how-to-choose-barefoot-minimalist-running-shoes.html|accessdate=9 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Barefoot Running Shoes'' are characterized by their zero drop from heel to toe, no arch support, minimal cushioning at the heel, and a very thin sole of around 3-10mm. Also, the toe box is considerably wider to provide more space to the toes, whereby they slightly resemble the shape of ducks feet, when viewed from above and compared to traditional shoes. Few product lines fall into this category. Examples include the [[Vibram FiveFingers]] and [[Merrell_(company)|Merrell]] Glove, which use an outsole produced by [[Vibram]], or the [[Xero_Shoes|Xero]] Prio.
* ''Minimalist Running Shoes'' are in-between traditional running shoes and barefoot running shoes. They have a reduced heel-to-toe drop of about 4–8&amp;nbsp;mm, reduced cushioning and reduced or no arch support. The toe box is usually in-between barefoot and traditional running shoes.

In recognition of the barefoot running movement, major companies also started producing shoes targeted at this customer segment. However, these shoes do not usually meet the requirement of a minimal or barefoot shoe. Examples include:
* The [[Nike Free]], which has a 17&amp;nbsp;mm heel and is marketed as minimalist running shoe, though this designation is disputed by some.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hutchinson |first=Alex |url=http://www.runnersworld.com/running-shoes/do-minimalist-shoes-really-simulate-barefoot-running |title=Do Minimalist Shoes Really Simulate Barefoot Running? &amp;#124; Runner's World |publisher=Runnersworld.com |date=2013-01-12 |accessdate=2013-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Adidas Adizero line, which has a heel-to-toe drop of 4 to 10mm, a total heel height of up to 30mm and a comparatively traditional, narrow toe box.
* The [[Champion_(sportswear)|Champion]] Alpha.
In contrast to ''barefoot'' and ''minimal'' shoes, one of the marketing terms repeatedly employed for this product segment is ''natural running''.

'''Olivos Rugby Club''' is an [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[rugby union]] and [[field hockey]] club located in [[Munro, Buenos Aires]]. The rugby team is member of the [[Unión de Rugby de Buenos Aires]] (URBA), having won its only [[Torneo de la URBA|URBA championship]] in 1940. Olivos currently competes in Primera División B, the second division of the URBA league system.

Olivos' hockey teams are affiliated to [[Buenos Aires Hockey Association]] (AHBA), competing in championships organised by the body.

==History==
The sporting institution was founded on September 4, 1927 as a rugby club by 20 young men of the Vicente López district. Although the club is located in [[Munro, Buenos Aires|Munro]], it bears the name of nearby [[Olivos, Buenos Aires Province|Olivos]], the seat of the Vicente López district.

One of the founders of the club was young Alejandro Bowers who came from a wealthy background. His father, Don Carlos Bowers, would become a major benefactor and the club's colours of Orange and Black were chosen in his honour.

After a couple of friendly games the club would enter the third level of the URBA championship in 1929, reach the first level in 1933 and win their first, and so far only, URBA title in 1940.

Since then, the club has been a constant feature in the league, fielding teams at all levels.

===Honours===

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6235">'''Omniturf''' is a brand of sand in-filled second-generation [[artificial turf]],&lt;ref name=bnoicwoaf&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4h9ZAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=noYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2277%2C4820522 |newspaper=The Bulletin |location=Bend, Oregon |agency=UPI |last=Roffo |first=Dave |title=Battle now on in competitive world of artificial fields |date=June 6, 1985 |page=D-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first artificial surface to be used by an [[English Football League]] club. 

==United Kingdom==
The first club to install this 'plastic grass' surface was [[Queens Park Rangers F. C.|Queens Park Rangers]] who installed the new pitch for the start of the 1981/82 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Jim Gregory R.I.P. | url=http://www.queensparkrangersfc.com/gregory.htm | work=Unofficial QPR Hall of Fame | publisher= | date= | accessdate=2009-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite much publicity around the supposed unfair advantage the pitch would provide Rangers, they proceeded to lose the opening home Division Two match on the new surface by 1-2 against [[Luton Town F. C.|Luton Town]].

The pitch did prove to be successful for Rangers though, as they reached the [[FA Cup]] Final in the 1981/82 season (as a 2nd Division club), and then won the (old) 2nd Division Championship the following season.

The innovation at [[Loftus Road]] brought mixed results, for while the ball ran smoothly enough over the hard surface, it was unpredictable when allowed to bounce. This caused confusion among defenders and goalkeepers in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=The pitch may be artificial but the need for a point is genuine | url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/oct/13/sport.comment2 | work=The Guardian.co.uk | publisher= | date=2007-10-13 | accessdate=2009-06-02 | location=London | first=David | last=Lacey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Omniturf pitch lasted at Rangers' [[Loftus Road]] ground for seven seasons; the pitch was torn up at the end of the 1987/88 season.

Other Football League clubs which also laid similar artificial surfaces during the 1980s were Luton Town, [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]], and [[Preston North End F. C.|Preston North End]].

==United States==
For [[American football]], Omniturf was installed several [[college football]] stadiums in the [[United States]]. Its first major venue was [[Autzen Stadium]] at the [[University of Oregon]] in [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]] in 1984.&lt;ref name=augasnew&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6uhVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=keEDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6245%2C6549368 |newspaper=Eugene Register-Guard |title=Autzen getting a sandy, new turf |agency=wire services |date=June 27, 1984 |page=1C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rghtstf&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=roRTAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=oYYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4150%2C5246623 |newspaper=The Bulletin |location=Bend, Oregon |title=Omni Turf, right stuff? |date=November 5, 1984 |page=D-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=iatstgrs&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LvNVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=y-EDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6026%2C5264195 |newspaper=Eugene Register-Guard |last=Bellamy |first=Ron |title=Is artificial turf safer than grass? |date=September 21, 1989 |page=1B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tfmker&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LXUzAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Ce8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2401%2C5323453 |newspaper=Spokesman-Review |last=Stalwick |first=Howie |title=Turf maker claims it has the answer |date=November 24, 1984 |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had generally favorable results and installed a second field in 1991, which was used until 2000, when the stadium used Nexturf the next year; it switched again to the current FieldTurf in 2002. [[Martin Stadium]] at [[Washington State University]] in [[Pullman, Washington|Pullman]] switched to Omniturf in 1990,&lt;ref name=fthrec &gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=MycuAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=EdEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5606%2C1888799 |newspaper=Idahonian |location=Moscow |title=For the record |date=May 14, 1990 |page=6A }}&lt;/ref&gt; and used it for a decade; like Autzen Stadium, it now uses FieldTurf.

The [[University of Missouri]] in [[Columbia, Missouri|Columbia]] had Omniturf at [[Faurot Field]] from 1985 through 1994, with less favorable reviews.&lt;ref name=afsrfc&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=MQNMAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=oEMDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4894%2C319688 |newspaper=Bulletin Journal |location=Cape Girardeau, Missouri |agency=UPI |title=Artificial surface approved for Mizzou |date=May 5, 1985 |page=3B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mzatbtds&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=a7cxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=mG4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2500%2C3795363 |newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |agency=wire dispatches |title=Missouri's artificial turf bites the dust |date=December 20, 1994 |page=C-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1990s, the surface was panned by both Tigers and opponents alike as one of the worst in college football.&lt;ref name=scrmsfd&gt;{{cite news |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19941016&amp;slug=1936250 |newspaper=Seattle Times |agency=Associated Press |last=Fallstrom |first=R.B. |title=Missouri ripping up Field Of Screams - treacherous turf faces final weeks of slippery career |date=October 16, 1994 |accessdate=October 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, the coaches in the [[Big Eight Conference]] issued a statement that Faurot Field's surface was "a detriment to the home and visiting teams and takes away from the integrity of the game played on such a field."&lt;ref name="mutigers.cstv.com"&gt;[http://mutigers.cstv.com/facilities/fac-mem-faurot-fb-timeline.html University of Missouri, Official Athletic Site of the Mizzou Tigers Facilities]&lt;/ref&gt; Missouri had a natural grass field prior to 1985, and returned to it in 1995.&lt;ref name=scrmsfd/&gt; The stadium has since switched to a [[FieldTurf]] surface.

==Canada==
The only major installation of OmniTurf in Canada was for the [[Canadian Football League|Canadian Football League's]] [[Saskatchewan Roughriders]]'s stadium, [[Mosaic Stadium at Taylor Field|Taylor Field]] in [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]]. It was installed in 1988 and stayed until the end of the 1999 season.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.riderville.com/2002/06/12/history/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Qualifying Grand Prix of Poland''' was the first qualifying Gliding Grand Prix for the [[FAI World Grand Prix 2010-2011]]. Because the usage of handicaps is not allowed in the Grand Prix style of competitions, only the planes with handicap index 101 from Club class are allowed. This gliders are: [[Schleicher ASW 19|ASW19, B]]; [[Schempp-Hirth Cirrus|Cirrus CS 11-75 L]]; [[Schempp-Hirth Cirrus|Cirrus G(w)]]; [[Schempp-Hirth Cirrus|Cirrus; Cirrus B(w)]];

Because very difficult weather conditions did allow only 2 races to be completed, the Qualifying Grand Prix of Poland 2010 has been canceled.

The recipient(s) is/are selected by a committee constituted by the Ministry and is honoured for their "spectacular and most outstanding performance in the field of sports over a period of four years" at international level. {{As of|2018}}, the award comprises a [[medal]]lion, a certificate, and a cash prize of {{INRConvert|7.5|l}}.{{efn|The cash prize was revised from {{INRConvert|1|l}} to {{INRConvert|3|l}} in 2000,&lt;ref name="RGKR98"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RGKR99"/&gt; to {{INRConvert|5|l}} in 2002,&lt;ref name="RGKR1"/&gt; and to {{INRConvert|7.5|l}} in 2009.&lt;ref name="RGKR9"/&gt;}}&lt;ref name="scheme"/&gt;

Instituted in 1991–1992, the award was given for the performance by a sportsperson in a year. Based on the suggestions provided by 2014 award selection committee, the Ministry revised the criteria in February 2015 to consider the performance over a period of four years. The nominations for a given year are accepted till 30 April or last working day of April with not more than two sportspersons nominated for each sports discipline. A twelve-member committee evaluates the performances of a sportsperson at various International events like [[Olympic Games]], [[Paralympic Games]], [[Asian Games]], and [[Commonwealth Games]]. The committee later submits their recommendations to the [[Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports (India)|Union Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports]] for further approval.

The first recipient of the award was [[Grandmaster (chess)|Chess Grandmaster]] [[Viswanathan Anand]], who was honoured for the performance in the year 1991–92. In 2001, [[Shooting sport|sport shooter]] [[Abhinav Bindra]], then aged 18, became the youngest recipient of the award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiatimes.com/sports/more-sports/abhinav-bindra-5-interesting-facts-about-indias-ace-shooter-175489.html|title=5 Interesting Facts About Abhinav Bindra|work=The Times of India|date=23 September 2014|accessdate=15 May 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160621122935/http://www.indiatimes.com/sports/more-sports/abhinav-bindra-5-interesting-facts-about-indias-ace-shooter-175489.html|archivedate=21 June 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually conferred upon only one sportsperson in a year, a few exceptions have been made (1993–1994, 2002, 2009, 2012, and 2016–2018) when multiple recipients were awarded in a year. {{As of|2018}}, there have been thirty-six recipients from fourteen sport disciplines: [[Sport of athletics|Athletics]], [[Badminton]], [[English billiards|Billiards]], [[Professional boxing|Boxing]], [[Chess]], [[Cricket]], [[Field hockey]], [[Gymnastics]], [[Shooting sport|Shooting]], [[Snooker]], [[Tennis]], [[Wrestling]], [[Olympic weightlifting|Weightlifting]], and [[Yacht racing]].

==Nominations==

The nominations for the award are received from all government recognised National Sports Federations, the [[Indian Olympic Association]], the [[Sports Authority of India]] (SAI), the Sports Promotion and Control Boards, and the state and the union territory governments with not more than two eligible sportspersons nominated for each sports discipline. In case of cricket, the nominations are received from the [[Board of Control for Cricket in India]] and SAI is authorised to submit the nominations on behalf of all the de-recognised or under suspension National Sports Federations.{{efn|name=cricket|For cricket, there is no National Sports Federation recognised by the Government.&lt;ref name="scheme"/&gt;}} The previous award recipients can also nominate one sportsperson for the discipline for which they themselves were awarded. The Government can nominate up to two sportspersons in deserving cases where no such nominations have been received from the nominating authorities. The nominations for a given year are accepted till 30 April or last working day of April.&lt;ref name="scheme"/&gt;

All the received nominations are sent to SAI and [[National Anti-Doping Agency]] for the verification against the claimed achievements and doping clearance respectively. Any sportsperson who is either penalised or being enquired for usage of drugs or substances banned by the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] is not eligible for the award.

==Controversies==

The 2002 selection committee headed by former football player [[Pradip Kumar Banerjee]] made twenty one recommendations for the [[Arjuna Award]] and two recommendations for the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna Award, athlete [[K. M. Beenamol]] and shooter [[Anjali Bhagwat]]. The government rejected the recommendations and asked the committee to cut down the list to comply with the award guidelines, where only one sportsperson for the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna Award and fifteen sportspersons along with one disabled athlete for the Arjuna Awards could be recommended each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Arjuna-Awards-panel-to-prune-list/articleshow/118763.cms|title=Arjuna Awards panel to prune list|work=The Times of India|date=7 August 2003|agency=Press Trust of India|accessdate=14 May 2016|location=New Delhi|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803124633/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Arjuna-Awards-panel-to-prune-list/articleshow/118763.cms|archivedate=3 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee revised the list to recommend Beenamol for the award over Bhagwat but also put a request "to consider everyone".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/sports/2003/aug/09khel.htm|title=Beenamol to get Khel Ratna|publisher=Rediff.com|date=9 August 2003|accessdate=15 May 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160805012504/http://www.rediff.com/sports/2003/aug/09khel.htm|archivedate=5 August 2016|df=}}

[[Image:Rowing Sport Oarlock.jpg|thumb|right|A rowlock used for the sport of rowing]]

A '''rowlock'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/rowlock|title=rowlock Meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary|publisher=|accessdate=14 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPAc-en|uk|ˈ|r|ɒ|l|ə|k}}, sometimes '''spur''' (due to the similarity in shape and size), '''oarlock''' (USA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vocabularie.com/oarlock|title=Oarlock - definition and common misspellings|publisher=|accessdate=14 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  or '''gate''' (Australia) is a brace that attaches an [[oar]] to a [[rowing|boat]]. When a boat is rowed, the rowlock acts as a [[lever|fulcrum]], and, in doing so,  the propulsive force that the rower exerts on the water with the oar is transferred to the boat by the thrust force exerted on the rowlock.

On ordinary rowing craft, the rowlocks are attached to the [[gunwale]]s.  In the sport of [[rowing (sport)|rowing]], the rowlocks are attached to [[outrigger]]s (often just called "riggers"), which project from the boat and provide greater leverage.  In sport rowing, the rowlocks are normally U-shaped and attached to a vertical pin which allows the rowlock to pivot around the pin during the rowing stroke. They additionally have a locking mechanism  (properly known as "the gate") across the top of the "U" to prevent the oar from unintentionally popping out of the rowlock.

Originally, rowlocks were two wooden posts or [[Glossary of nautical terms#Thole|thole]] pins that the shaft of the oar nestled between. Single THOLE PINS may be used when the oars have holes cut into the loom which then sits over/around the THOLE PIN. (Captain Dennis Robinson FNI, Master Mariner)

==Sport rowing==
In sport rowing oarlocks were originally brass or bronze and open (no gate). With the advent of modern materials oarlocks are now injection moulded plastic and precision made to minimize play (slop) between the oar collar and the oarlock. The most recent sport racing oarlocks have a spring loaded feature to keeps the oar collar firmly against the pin at all times.

Oarlocks are technical pieces of equipment in sport rowing, holding the oar shaft and therefore the oar blade at the correct angle in the water to ensure optimum performance.

==Heraldry==

The Norwegian municipalities of [[Fosnes]], [[Radøy]] and [[Tjøme]] have rowlocks in their coats-of-arms.

The '''Self-Transcendence 6- &amp; 10- day''' race are two concurrently [[multiday races|multiday]] running events at the [[Flushing Meadows – Corona Park|Corona Park]], borough [[Queens]] in [[New York City]].{{coord|40.739425|-73.843132|type:event_globe:earth_region:US-AK_scale:2000|name="Self-Transcendence 6- &amp; 10-day Race"|display=title}} The course is one mile (1.6 &amp;nbsp;km) long.&lt;ref name="HB" /&gt; They are held annually in April and organized by the [[Chinmoy|Sri Chinmoy]] Marathon Team.&lt;ref name="md" /&gt;&lt;ref name="scr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="duv" /&gt;

==History and Records==
The Team held a 1000-mile race in the spring of 1985, and later in the year held the first [[Sri Chinmoy]] Five Day Race at [[Flushing Meadow Park]] in [[Queens]], which lasted for three consecutive years and led to the Seven Day Race, the forerunner of today's Ten Day event. The first Five Day Race featured 15 competitors as did the first Seven Day Race. By 1995 the longer event grew to 34 starters.

In the inaugural Seven Day Race in 1988, Marty Sprengelmeyer of Davenport, Iowa narrowly beat women's winner [[Suprabha Beckjord]] of Washington, DC. 527 miles to 521 miles.
 
In 1990 ultra legend [[Al Howie]] set a new record of 530 miles. The following year Charlie Eidel of Gardiner, NY ran 550 miles for a new course record, while Suprabha Beckjord ran 523 to claim the women's record again. Suprabha won the Seven Day five times for the ladies. In 1994 Antana Locs of Canada won the Seven Day overall with 518 miles. 
Georgs Jermolajevs came all the way from Latvia to win the Seven Day Race in 1995, in record-setting fashion, running 578 miles, while England's Pippa Davis finally laid claim to the women's title as she ran 525 miles. 
In the 1996 inaugural Ten Day Race, Georgs Jermolajevs again fashioned a victory with 725 miles, but was hard pressed by [[Dipali Cunningham]] of Australia, who garnered 723 miles for the ladies. In a smaller field in 1997 veteran Donald Winkley of Corpus Christi,Texas prevailed with 530 miles.

In 1998 the [[Sri Chinmoy]] Marathon Team added the 6 day race to their calendar in this year Dipali Cunningham breaking [[Sandy Barwick]]'s record with 504 miles. 
In 2000 [[Ted Corbitt]] at 81 set a new World age-group best (80-84) with 240 miles and in the following year, 2001, the last races held at Wards Island yielded another great performance from Dipali Cunningham - winning the 6 day overall and set a new World Record with 510 miles.&lt;ref name="md" /&gt;&lt;ref name="scr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="duv" /&gt;&lt;ref name="inspiringnews" /&gt;

'''T. I. and Power''' was a football club from [[Bhutan]],&lt;ref name="RSSSF1986" /&gt; based at [[Changlimithang Stadium|Changlimithang]], who played in the inaugural [[A-Division (Bhutan)|Bhutan A-Division]], then the top level of football in Bhutan, but since replaced by a full [[Bhutan National League|national league]].&lt;ref name="RSSSF2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesb/bhutan2012.html|title=Bhutan 2012|last=Schöggl|first=Hans|last2=Stokkermans|first2=Karel|last3=Jigmi|first3=Sonam|date=28 Feb 2013|website=www.rsssf.com|publisher=[[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation]]|accessdate=27 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
They finished eighth in the [[1986 A-Division (Bhutan)|inaugural]] season,&lt;ref name="RSSSF1986" /&gt; with just a single victory over [[Health School]] and two draws against [[Public Works Department (Bhutanese football club)|Public Works Department]] and [[Education (Bhutanese football club)|Education]] to their name.&lt;ref name="RSSSF1986" /&gt; They scored eleven goals in the whole competition, more than any other team outside the top three, but were defensively the weakest in the league, conceding twenty goals in total.&lt;ref name="RSSSF1986" /&gt; There are no records available for any competitions held between 1987–1995&lt;ref name="RSSSFChamp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesb/bhutanchamp.html|title=Bhutan&amp;nbsp;– List of Champions|last=Schöggl|first=Hans|last2=Abbink|first2=Dinant|date=28 May 2014|website=www.rsssf.com|publisher=[[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation]]|accessdate=27 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; so it is not known whether they competed again, and there is no record of them competing in any future season for which records exist.&lt;ref name="RSSSFChamp" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5807">[[Image:Tabletennis.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Table tennis racqet]]
A basic '''table tennis racqet''' (also known as a "[[bat-and-ball games|paddle]]" or "bat") is used by [[table tennis]] players. The table tennis racket is usually made from laminated wood covered with rubber on one or two sides depending on the player's grip.  Unlike a conventional "[[Racqet_(sports_equipment)|racqet]]", it does not include strings strung across an open frame. The USA generally uses the term "paddle" while Europeans and Asians use the term "bat" and the official ITTF term is "racket".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=ITTF |date=August 2018 |accessdate=16 November 2018 |title=The International Table Tennis Federation Handbook 2018 |url=https://d3mjm6zw6cr45s.cloudfront.net/2018/02/2018ITTFHandbook_v2.pdf_0.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
Table tennis regulations approved by the [[International Table Tennis Federation]] (ITTF) allow different surfaces on each side of the paddle for various amounts of spin (including nullifying it) or speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Varenberg|first1=M.|last2=Varenberg|first2=A.|date=2012|title=Table tennis rubber: Tribological characterization|journal=Tribology Letters|volume=47|issue=1|pages=51–56|doi=10.1007/s11249-012-9961-4|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11249-012-9961-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a player may have a spin-heavy rubber on one side of his paddle, and no spin on the other side. The player can flip the racket in play for different types of returns. To help a player distinguish between different types of rubber used by his opponent, regulations specify that one side of a paddle must be red while the other must be black, allowing a player to see what side of a paddle hits the ball mid-play. The player has the right to inspect his opponent's racquet before a match to see the type and color. Current rules state that, unless damaged in play, the paddle cannot be exchanged for another at any time during a match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ping Pong Paddle|url=https://bestreviewshunt.com/best-ping-pong-paddle/|publisher=Bestreviewshunt.com|accessdate=17 November 2016|date=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rubber coating may be of pimpled rubber, with the pimples outward, or it may be composed of a sponge layer, covered by rubber that may have the pimples pointed inwards or outwards.  Some paddles are not covered with rubber ("naked") to make it spin resistant. However, it is illegal to use these types of racquet in competition as they are not approved by the ITTF. Some types of rubbers are also not approved. Approved rubbers have the ITTF emblem on the base of the rubber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Table tennis|url=http://www.sizes.com/sports/table_tennis.htm#website|website=www.sizes.com|accessdate=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assembling ==
;Choices
Players have many choices and variations in rubber sheets on their racquet. Although a racquet may be purchased assembled with rubber by the manufacturer, most serious tournament players will use a custom racquet. A player selects a blank blade (i.e., a racquet without rubber) based on his or her playing style. The type of wood or synthetic layers used to make up the blade will determine the blade's speed. The different types of rubber sheets affect the level of spin, speed, and other specific playing characteristics. Racquet construction and new rubber technology contribute significantly to the amount of deviation from the expected ball flight path.

==Glue and gluing==
Normally, a sheet of rubber is glued to a blade using various table tennis brand glues such as Butterfly, Donic, and DHS. Some glues may work even if it wasn't designed specifically for table tennis, such as Rubber Cement and Tear Mender. The rubber is not removed until it wears out or becomes damaged. In the 1980s, some players developed a new technique with a special glue called [[speed glue]] to apply the rubber every time he played. The glue would help provide more spin and speed by providing a "[[catapult]]" effect. 

The fairly recent development of speed glue speeds up the departure of the ball from the rubber considerably, though at the cost of some ball control on [[touch shot]]s &lt;!-- Note: This seems to be a table tennis term, so please don't change it to "tough" which is what I thought it should be until I Googled the term. --&gt; where little or no spin is put on the ball.  Speed glue was allowed for the last time in the [[2008 Summer Olympics]]. From the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] onward, the Olympic games banned speed glue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tabletennis.about.com/od/speedglue/a/ban_speedglue.htm  ITTF Bans Speed Glue, Boosters and Tuners - and Much More!] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402105148/http://tabletennis.about.com/od/speedglue/a/ban_speedglue.htm |date=2015-04-02 }} By Greg Letts, About.com. Accessed September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== Maintaining and protection ==
The surface of a racquet will develop a smooth glossy [[patina]] with use. The rubber surface needs regular cleaning to retain a high friction surface for ball spin. Commercial cleaners or water and soap can be cleaning agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.megaspin.net/info/equip.asp|title= Table Tennis Information - Equipment maintenance|accessdate=2007-07-10 |last=|first=|authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=Megaspin |pages= |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sun exposure may damage the rubber.

'''Tipsport Arena''' is a multi-purpose [[arena]] in Prague, Czech Republic, whose naming rights are currently leased to Czech betting company [[Tipsport]]. The arena, located on the fairgrounds in the neighbourhood of [[Holešovice]], opened in 1962 as '''Sportovní hala''' and has a capacity of 13,150 for [[ice hockey]] games.&lt;ref name="Informace o areně"/&gt; It was the home arena of Czech extraliga team [[HC Sparta Praha]] and KHL's [[HC Lev Praha]].

During its existence, the arena has hosted many important sporting events. It hosted the [[Ice Hockey World Championships]] four times and for years hosted a prestigious annual figure skating competition. The arena hosted the [[1980 Davis Cup]] final, where [[Czechoslovakia Davis Cup team|Czechoslovakia]] defeated [[Italy Davis Cup team|Italy]].

Hundreds of concerts have also been staged at the arena during its history. It was the largest and most important arena in Czechoslovakia and the Czech Republic for over 40 years until the new [[O2 Arena (Prague)|O2 Arena]] opened in 2004.

'''Touch match officials''' are responsible for fairly enforcing the ''Playing Rules'' of [[Touch (sport)|Touch]] during a match and imposing penalties for deliberate breaches of these rules.&lt;ref name=rules&gt;{{cite web|title=Playing Rules, 4th Edition|url=http://www.sportingpulse.com/assoc_page.cgi?client=14-4863-0-0-0&amp;sID=64321&amp;&amp;news_task=DETAIL&amp;articleID=5215330|publisher=Federation of International Touch|accessdate=31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most senior match official is the ''referee'', they may be assisted by a range of other officials depending on the level and rules of the competition.

==Equipment==
The match officials may use the following equipment:
;Coin
:The referee organises a coin toss with the team captains to decide who taps off and what end each team takes initially.
;Whistle
:Referees must carry  a [[whistle]] to stop play and then signal to players about many things during a game. A referee will let players know when to stop after foul play or while awarding a [[Touch football (rugby league)#Scoring|touchdown]] and at other times in a game.

==Uniform==
All referees wear an official uniform of a colour (generally white) distinguishable from those being worn by the two sides playing each other. Referees wear a coloured badge to indicate which [[#Levels|level of accreditation]] they have achieved.&lt;ref name=uniform&gt;{{cite web|title=International Uniform Policy|url=http://www.sportingpulse.com/assoc_page.cgi?client=14-4863-0-0-0&amp;sID=64321&amp;&amp;news_task=DETAIL&amp;articleID=14391191|publisher=Federation of International Touch|accessdate=31 January 2013|location=7|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accreditation==
Referees must first pass refereeing exams set by their national governing body before officiating at progressively more senior levels of the sport, gaining experience in lower-level competitions and then moving onto higher-level competitions where they will progress to the top if good enough.

===Levels===
Referees are accredited according to a numbered level system, with '''Level 1''' generally being the lowest, introductory, level. The number of levels as well as badge colours, shapes and sizes differ depending on the governing body.&lt;br/&gt;
''[[Touch Football Australia]] operates under a six-level structure&lt;ref name=tfaccred&gt;{{cite web|title=Section 2|url=http://www.sportingpulse.com/assoc_page.cgi?client=14-3591-0-0-0&amp;sID=46574&amp;&amp;news_task=DETAIL&amp;articleID=4247529|work=Referees Policy &amp; Procedures Manual|publisher=Touch Football Australia|accessdate=31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  while [[Touch NZ]] uses a four-level system and [[Touch Europe]] uses five.''

====Gold Badge====
The '''Gold Badge''' is the most distinguished badge that can be awarded to a referee and is awarded by the [[Federation of International Touch]]. At present, they are awarded to the ten highest ranked referees at the [[Touch Football World Cup]], which is held every four years.&lt;ref name=goldbadgenz&gt;{{cite web|title=touchnz.co.nz/index.php?id=16&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=238&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=17&amp;cHash=a2c6b65e2a|url=http://www.touchnz.co.nz/index.php?id=16&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=238&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=17&amp;cHash=a2c6b65e2a|publisher=Touch NZ|accessdate=31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Refereeing systems==
Different refereeing systems are in use:
;'''Single Referee'''
:One referee officiates the match, without the help of sideline officials. The single-referee system is usually only used in park-level/social competition where the availability of referees is low.
;'''Dual Referee'''
:Two referees control the match and alternate between the role of central referee and sideline official. The dual-referee system is used only in park-level/social competition where the availability of referees is low.
;'''Triple Referee'''
:Three referees control the match in a similar way to the dual-referee system, with one central referee and a sideline official on each sideline. The triple-referee system is the standard system and is required at all representative levels of the game.

==Positions and responsibilities&lt;ref name="rules" /&gt;==

===Player safety===
Referees are to inspect player uniforms, playing boots, jewellery and fingernails to ensure player safety.

===Tap-off and direction===
The referees organises a coin toss with the captains of the two teams playing to decide which team taps off and which end they play at from tap-off.

===Area of control===
Referees have control over all players and team officials participating in the match, including substitute players. A referee's area of control extends to a general radius of 10&amp;nbsp;metres from the edge of the field.

===Referee's signals===
The referee uses signals to communicate his/her decisions with the players, team officials and spectators.

===Central Referee and Sideline Officials===
Generally, matches are controlled by three referees, alternating between the role of central referee and sideline official. The central referee controls play and makes all decisions. Sideline officials are responsible for controlling substituting players, advising the referee of forward passes (through discreet signals), and assisting the central referee in controlling onside defenders. Only the central referee uses his/her whistle.

'''Waterballs''' are water toys that are played on the water surface with players interacting with the water toy and the water in any number of play patterns. Generally players throw waterballs at varying speeds across the water and air at varying angles to get the desired [[Stone skipping|skip]] pattern. Play is generally between players and play patterns can involve a variety of apparatus and equipment, such as special pools with goals and watercourts.

==In popular culture==
They are palm-sized waterballs that can travel as fast as they can be thrown. They can travel a great distance, even crossing large moving [[waterways]]. High-performance waterballs currently are not well known to the public as they have only been on the US market for a few years, having been introduced in the summer of 2008 with the launch of the [[Waboba|Waboba Ball]].&lt;ref name=telegraphball&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/2484555/Ball-that-bounces-on-water-is-latest-beach-toy.html|title = Ball that bounces on water is summer craze|date = 2008-08-01|website = Telegraph.co.uk|access-date = 2016-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Splash balls or [[Water balloon|water bombs]] are well known to the public and have been on the market in the US for years. They are designed for children and adults to play on a water surface. These are also more suitable for children and non-sport uses. Splash balls or [[Water balloon|water bombs]] are not high-performance waterballs or part of this discussion.

There are a number of [[nerf]]-styled [[Water polo|polo]] waterballs on the market that are smaller and softer than the regulation sport polo waterball. These are also more suitable for children and non-sport uses. These are polo and catch balls designed to play on the water surface however they are not high-performance waterballs or part of this discussion.

Generally, high-performance waterballs have little [[friction]] on the water, they are relatively small in size and density making them generally a [[handball]] size. With a certain amount of force they skip, bounce and glide in a straight line on the water surface and can travel fast and long distance. They can be projected on the water between players at a range of 3– 200 feet as there is very little friction slow them on the water surface – particularly the sealed waterball. Each time they bounce, skip or roll on the water surface, the inertia is reduced by opposing forces of gravity, friction, [[surface tension]], [[Drag (physics)|surface drag]].

Waterballs have traditionally been seen as a children's toy, with a number of manufacturers aiming for that particular [[market segment]] when introducing new products. The WaterRipper is being marketed as a kid's 4+ pool toy however it is also marketed as a high-performance action sports water ball. Most waterballs are sold in sporting goods, toy stores, outdoor stores and even food stores. The WaterRipper was launched in the United States in July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700055506/Outdoor-games-including-safer-versions-of-old-faves-are-simply-good-green-fun.html?pg=all|title = Outdoor games, including safer versions of old faves, are simply good, green fun|last = Arrington|first = Debbie|date = 2010-08-10|website = DeseretNews.com|access-date = 2016-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Waboba ball was initially marketed overseas, introduced in [[Scandinavia]] 2005 and in the [[United Kingdom]] in 2008.&lt;ref name=telegraphball /&gt; It is now sold worldwide.

==Size, shape and materials==
The high-performance waterball is generally the size of a [[golf ball]] or stress ball designed for catching with a single hand.&lt;ref name="sacbee"&gt;http://www.sacbee.com/2010/07/20/2900977/game-on-the-lawn-outdoor-games.html&lt;/ref&gt; Different waterballs are made of different materials. Most high-performance waterballs are sealed balls and are made out of different types of rubber or [[neoprene]] with gel material center and [[polyurethane]] and [[Spandex|Lycra]] jacket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Waterball - Size, Shape and Materials|url=http://www.primidi.com/waterball/size_shape_and_materials}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new generation waterball is water absorbing with fluid high-density particulate contents. There are patent pending designs for "high density” or “balanced density " materials in making the new generation waterballs.

High-performance waterballs come in different sizes and shapes. There are a handful of high-performance waterballs such as Waboba Ball, Water Bouncer, and the WaterRipper currently sold in the US. The sealed or water absorbing high-performance waterballs are slightly larger + 2” or larger and made of soft rubber generally with a neoprene single seam jacket. These balls are designed to bounce on the water surface.

The water absorbing waterball is the smallest of these high-performance waterballs. It is a collapsing bag or sack like a footbag with an Ultra Suede single seam cover and beaded fill with other water absorbing high-density materials. It is designed to skip and roll on water in a low profile skip pattern. It is less than 2” in diameter and it easily fits and collapses in a 4+ year old’s hand. It looks and feels like a footbag or [[Hacky sack|Hacky Sack]]. The water absorbing waterball like the Waboba Blast Ball and Water Ripper Ball are the only high-performance waterballs designed to absorb water.

===Sealed waterballs vs. absorbent waterballs===
[[Image:Water Bag floating - water absorbing, balanced density design.jpg|thumb|alt=Water Bag floating - water absorbing, balanced density design.|Water Bag floating - water absorbing, balanced density design]]
There are actually two types of high-performance waterballs. While all waterballs float on water, there are some that absorb water and others that are sealed. '''Sealed waterballs''' generally bounce higher because they simply repel &amp; displace water. This type of waterball requires the players to have a grip or “timed grab” to catch the ball in flight and stop it. Because they bounce, they are generally hard to catch and often require two hands or a mitt or glove to control or catch them and more suited for adult play.

Conversely, the water absorbing collapsing waterball or waterbag is generally caught with one hand. Because it collapses on impact on the water or in your hand, it is easier and safer to play with young children ages 4+.
[[Image:Water bag being thrown.jpg|thumb|alt=Water Bag being thrown - the physics and motion.|Water Bag being thrown - the physics and motion.]]

A sealed ball displaces and bounces on water as it interacts with the water surface. On impact with the water surface or a player's hand, the sealed waterball deforms and deflects and transfers its energy in the opposite direction as it bounces on impact. But a sealed waterball no matter how soft still maintains its spherical shape and ball like properties. The fluid dynamics and shape characteristics are relatively unchanged as the sealed waterball does not change its density.

As such, even [[tennis ball]]s and handballs, [[stress ball]]s can be used as waterball and perform, admitted poorly, depending on force and angle to the water etc.

'''Water absorbing waterballs''' or technically "waterbags", on the other hand, are designed for water and density exchange. Water freely permeates the whole ball, adding more weight and dynamic fluid density. The added weight makes this type of waterball skip and roll on water, rather than bounce. As a result, water absorbing high-performance waterballs travel shorter distances than sealed waterballs but they are easier to control and play with both in long and short range.
[[Image:Low profile skip pattern.jpg|thumb|alt=Water Bag being thrown by a player - Low profile skip pattern.|Water Bag being thrown by a player - Low profile skip pattern.]]

A waterbag exchanges its fluid density and transforms and conforms its shape and fluid contents on impact with a surface or plain. On impact with a surface such as water, the waterbag dissipates its energy dynamically as it interacts with the water surface exchanging fluid contents. This changes and balances the bag's density, mass and shape to conform to the water or surface it is performing on as it loses its velocity and comes to rest.

The beanbag-like design of the waterbag changes shape and conforms to a surface thus it collapses and is "slow acting" on impact. There is a significant difference between the physics of the sealed waterball and the water absorbing waterball or waterbag.

The waterbag exchanges its fluid contents on impact and it changes its shape as it collapses on impact. There is no bouncing or minimal bouncing action. Slow acting on impact is an intended design characteristic that is very pleasing and safe in high-speed play action. The "rolling action" of the waterbag that is referred to a "low skip profile" on the water surface that again collapses on impact with the water surface or player's hand. This makes the waterbag less active and easier to catch. The waterbag is both fast in action and slow acting on impact.

==Safety issues==
Most waterballs currently available, while perfectly functional in water, are not designed to work well on a hard surface.&lt;ref name="article"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/2484555/Ball-that-bounces-on-water-is-latest-beach-toy.html Ball that bounces on water is latest beach toy - Telegraph&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; This is particularly true with the new generation waterbag design.

The impact of a waterball can hurt, and some waterballs have marks left on their skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsreview.com/chico/let-er-rip/content?oid=1438092|title=Let ’er rip - 15 Minutes - Opinions - June 10, 2010|website=Chico News &amp; Review|access-date=2016-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there are several balls that address these issues by using softer and lighter material.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.waboba.com&lt;/ref&gt;
They have a low skip pattern and they are easy to catch and stay in the pool. Water absorbing waterbag designs are also designed in a way that makes them suitable for play in pools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ripperball.com WaterRipper | Ripperball.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Yud-Alef Stadium''' ({{lang-he|אצטדיון הי"א}}, ''Etztadion HaYudAlef'', lit. ''The 11 Stadium'') is a football [[stadium]] in [[Ashdod]], [[Israel]], that was built for local football sides Maccabi Ashdod, Beitar Ashdod (both merged in 1981 to form [[Maccabi Ironi Ashdod F.C.|Maccabi Ironi Ashdod]]) and [[Hapoel Ashdod F.C.|Hapoel Ashdod]] (merged with Ironi Ashdod in 1999 to create [[F.C. Ashdod]]).

The stadium was given the name "Yud-Alef" in 1973, after the eleven Israeli athletes murdered in the [[Munich massacre]] ([[Yodh|Yud]]-[[Aleph|Alef]] is used in [[Hebrew numerals]] used to represent the number 11). The naming ceremony took place on 17 July 1973, when the stadium hosted the final of the [[Football at the 1969 Maccabiah Games|1973 Maccabiah Games]].&lt;ref name="mac1"&gt;[http://jhpress.nli.org.il/Default/Scripting/ArticleWin.asp?From=Archive&amp;Source=Page&amp;Skin=TAUHe&amp;BaseHref=MAR/1973/07/18&amp;PageLabelPrint=11&amp;EntityId=Ar01105&amp;ViewMode=HTML Mexico Didn't Danger the U20's Gold At All] Shmuel Shohat, Ma'ariv, 18 July 1973, Historical Jewish Press {{he icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four stands in the stadium which is not aesthetically pleasing. The stadium is also thought to be one of the few in the world where the home fans have fewer seats than the visitors. There are a total of 4,000 seats in gates three and four (set aside for visiting supporters). Gates one and two together hold only 3,420 giving the local side a disadvantage when a bigger club comes to town.

In a recent article in [[Yedioth Ahronoth]], it was found that the stadium was not built properly and is not safe. The only parts that were deemed safe were the locker rooms and showers. In January 2015 the stadium management unveiled a new a revamped VIP stand.&lt;ref name="vip"&gt;[http://www.mynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-4611356,00.html An upgrade at the Stadium: Yes, But Only in the VIP Stand] Yair Harush, 7 January 2015, Mynet.co.il {{he icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 29 August 2006 the fences surrounding the pitch were removed to make for better sightliness for visitors to the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.one.co.il/cat/articles/article.aspx?id=80514&amp;bz=4 England in Ashdod: Stadium fences removed] One.co.il {{he icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
