'''''A Theory of Justice''''' is a work of [[political philosophy]] and [[ethics]] by [[John Rawls]], in which the author attempts to solve the problem of [[distributive justice]] (the [[social justice|socially just]] distribution of goods in a society) by utilising a variant of the familiar device of the [[social contract]]. The resultant theory is known as "[[Justice as Fairness]]", from which Rawls derives his two principles of justice. Together, they dictate that society should be structured so that the greatest possible amount of liberty is given to its members, limited only by the notion that the liberty of any one member shall not infringe upon that of any other member. Secondly, inequalities – either social or economic – are only to be allowed if the worst off will be better off than they might be under an equal distribution. Finally, if there is such a beneficial inequality, this inequality should not make it harder for those without resources to occupy positions of power – for instance, public office.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/466334703|title=Rawls explained: from fairness to utopia|last=Voice|first=Paul|date=2011|publisher=Open Court|isbn=0812696808|location=|pages=41–48|oclc=466334703}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First published in 1971, ''A Theory of Justice'' was revised in 1975 (for the translated editions) and 1999.

==Objective==
In ''A Theory of Justice,'' Rawls argues for a principled reconciliation of [[liberty]] and [[Equality before the law|equality]] that is meant to apply to the basic structure of a well-ordered society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Follesdal Mertens, Andreas |title= Real world justice: grounds, principles, human rights, and social institutions |publisher=Springer |location=Dordrecht |year=2005 |page=88 |isbn=9781402031410 |oclc= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Central to this effort is an account of the circumstances of justice, inspired by [[David Hume]], and a fair choice situation for parties facing such circumstances, similar to some of [[Immanuel Kant]]'s views. Principles of justice are sought to guide the conduct of the parties. These parties are recognized to face moderate scarcity, and they are neither naturally altruistic nor purely egoistic. They have ends which they seek to advance, but prefer to advance them through cooperation with others on mutually acceptable terms. Rawls offers a model of a fair choice situation (the [[original position]] with its [[veil of ignorance]]) within which parties would hypothetically choose mutually acceptable principles of justice. Under such constraints, Rawls believes that parties would find his favoured principles of justice to be especially attractive, winning out over varied alternatives, including [[utilitarian]] and [[right-libertarian]] accounts.

==The "original position"==
{{Main|Original position}}
Rawls belongs to the [[social contract]] tradition, although he takes a different view from that of previous thinkers. Specifically, Rawls develops what he claims are principles of justice through the use of an artificial device he calls the ''Original position''; in which, everyone decides principles of justice from behind a [[veil of ignorance]]. This "veil" is one that essentially blinds people to all facts about themselves so they cannot tailor principles to their own advantage:

: "...no one knows his place in society, his class position or social status, nor does anyone know his fortune in the distribution of natural assets and abilities, his intelligence, strength, and the like. I shall even assume that the parties do not know their conceptions of the good or their special psychological propensities. The principles of justice are chosen behind a veil of ignorance."

According to Rawls, ignorance of these details about oneself will lead to principles that are fair to all. If an individual does not know how he will end up in his own conceived society, he is likely not going to privilege any one class of people, but rather develop a scheme of justice that treats all fairly. In particular, Rawls claims that those in the ''Original Position'' would all adopt a [[Minimax|maximin]] strategy which would maximize the prospects of the least well-off.

: "They are the principles that rational and free persons concerned to further their own interests would accept in an initial position of equality as defining the fundamentals of the terms of their association." (Rawls, p. 11)

Rawls bases his ''Original Position'' on a "thin theory of the good" which he says "explains the rationality underlying choice of principles in the Original Position". A full theory of the good follows after we derive principles from the original position. Rawls claims that the parties in the original position would adopt two such principles, which would then govern the assignment of rights and duties and regulate the distribution of social and economic advantages across society. The difference principle permits inequalities in the distribution of goods only if those inequalities benefit the worst-off members of society. Rawls believes that this principle would be a rational choice for the representatives in the original position for the following reason: Each member of society has an equal claim on their society's goods. Natural attributes should not affect this claim, so the basic right of any individual, before further considerations are taken into account, must be to an equal share in material wealth. What, then, could justify unequal distribution? Rawls argues that inequality is acceptable only if it is to the advantage of those who are worst-off.

The agreement that stems from the original position is both ''hypothetical'' and ''ahistorical''. It is hypothetical in the sense that the principles to be derived are what the parties would, under certain legitimating conditions, agree to, not what they have agreed to. Rawls seeks to use an argument that the principles of justice are what ''would'' be agreed upon if people were in the hypothetical situation of the original position and that those principles have moral weight as a result of that. It is ahistorical in the sense that it is not supposed that the agreement has ever been, or indeed could ever have been, derived in the real world outside of carefully limited experimental exercises.

== The Two Principles of Justice ==
In chapter forty-seven, Rawls makes his final clarification on the principles of justice in one paragraph:&lt;blockquote&gt;"First Principle: Each person is to have an equal right to the most extensive total system of equal basic liberties compatible with a similar system of liberty for all."

"Second Principle: Social and economic inequalities are to be arranged so that they are both: (a) to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged, consistent with the just savings principle, and (b) attached to offices and positions open to all under conditions of fair equality of opportunity."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41266156|title=A theory of justice|last=Rawls|first=John|publisher=|year=1971|isbn=0674000781|location=|pages=266|oclc=41266156}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;These principles are lexically ordered, and Rawls emphasizes the priority of liberty. The first principle is often called ''the greatest equal liberty principle.'' The second, until (b), ''the difference principle'' and the final addendum in (b) ''the'' ''equal opportunity principle''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== The Greatest Equal Liberty Principle ===

: "First: each person is to have an equal right to the most extensive basic liberty compatible with a similar liberty for others."&lt;ref&gt;Rawls, p. 53 revised edition; p. 60 old 1971 first edition&lt;/ref&gt;

Mainly concerned with distribution of rights and liberties, the basic liberties of citizens are the political liberty to vote and run for office, [[freedom of speech]] and assembly, liberty of conscience, freedom of personal property and freedom from arbitrary arrest. However, it is a matter of some debate whether [[freedom of contract]] can be inferred to be included among these basic liberties:

: "liberties not on the list, for example, the right to own certain kinds of property (e.g. [[means of production]]) and freedom of contract as understood by the doctrine of [[laissez-faire]] are not basic; and so they are not protected by the priority of the first principle."&lt;ref&gt;Rawls, p. 54 revised edition&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Difference Principle ===

:Social and economic inequalities are to be arranged so that (a) they are to be of the greatest benefit to the least-advantaged members of society, consistent with the just savings principle.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Rawls' claim in (a) is that departures from equality of a list of what he calls primary goods—"things which a rational man wants whatever else he wants" [Rawls, 1971, p.&amp;nbsp;92]—are justified only to the extent that they improve the lot of those who are worst-off under that distribution in comparison with the previous, equal, distribution. His position is at least in some sense [[egalitarian]], with a provision that inequalities are allowed when they benefit the least advantaged. An important consequence of Rawls' view is that inequalities can actually be just, as long as they are to the benefit of the least well off. His argument for this position rests heavily on the claim that morally arbitrary factors (for example, the family one is born into) shouldn't determine one's life chances or opportunities. Rawls is also keying on an intuition that a person does not morally deserve their inborn talents; thus that one is not entitled to all the benefits they could possibly receive from them; hence, at least one of the criteria which could provide an alternative to equality in assessing the justice of distributions is eliminated.

Further, the just savings principle requires that some sort of material respect is left for future generations, even though Rawls is ambiguous about what should be left for them, it can generally be understood as "a contribution to those coming later" [Rawls, 1971, p.&amp;nbsp;255].

=== The Equal Opportunity Principle ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;(b) offices and positions must be open to everyone under conditions of ''fair equality of opportunity''&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The stipulation in (b) is lexically prior to that in (a). This is because ''equal opportunity'' requires not merely that offices and positions are distributed on the basis of merit, but that all have reasonable opportunity to acquire the skills on the basis of which merit is assessed, even if one might not have the necessary material resources - due to a beneficial inequality stemming from the difference principle.

It may be thought that this stipulation, and even the first principle of justice, may require greater equality than the difference principle, because large social and economic inequalities, even when they are to the advantage of the worst-off, will tend to seriously undermine the value of the political liberties and any measures towards fair equality of opportunity.

== The Problem ==
A key problem to Rawls is to show how such principles would be universally adopted and here the work borders on general ethical issues.  He introduces a theoretical “veil of ignorance” in which all the “players” in the social game would be placed in a situation which is called the “original position”. Having only a general knowledge of the facts of “life and society”, each player is to abide based on their moral obligation. By denying the players any specific information about themselves, it forces them to adopt a generalized point of view that bears a strong resemblance to the moral point of view.

==Influence and reception==
In 1972, ''A Theory of Justice'' was reviewed in ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' by Marshall Cohen, who described the work as "magisterial," and suggested that Rawls' use of the techniques of [[analytic philosophy]] made the book the "most formidable" defense of the [[social contract]] tradition to date. He credited Rawls with showing that the widespread claim that "systematic moral and political philosophy are dead" is mistaken, and with providing a "bold and rigorous" account of "the principles to which our public life is committed." Though he suggested that it might take years before a satisfactory appraisal of the work could be made, he noted that Rawls' accomplishments had been compared by scholars to those of [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Immanuel Kant]]. However, he criticized Rawls for "looseness in his understanding of some fundamental political concepts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/07/16/archives/a-theory-of-justice-by-john-rawls-607-pp-cambridge-mass-the-belknap.html?_r=0 |author=Marshall Cohen |title=The social contract explained and defended |website=Nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''A Theory of Justice'' received criticism from several philosophers. [[Robert Nozick]] criticized Rawls' account of distributive justice in his defense of [[libertarianism]], ''[[Anarchy, State, and Utopia]]'' (1974).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Nozick, Robert |authorlink=Robert Nozick |title=Anarchy, State, and Utopia |publisher=Blackwell Publishers |location=Oxford |year=1993 |pages=183–231 |isbn=0-631-19780-X |oclc= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Allan Bloom]], writing in ''[[American Political Science Review]]'' in 1975, noted that ''A Theory of Justice'' had "attracted more attention in the Anglo-Saxon world than any work of its kind in a generation", attributing its popularity to its being "the most ambitious political project undertaken by a member of the school currently dominant in academic philosophy" and to Rawls' "radical egalitarian interpretation of liberal democracy." Bloom criticized Rawls for failing to account for the existence of [[natural right]] in his theory of justice and wrote that Rawls absolutizes social union as the ultimate goal which would conventionalize everything into artifice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bloom, Allan |authorlink=Allan Bloom |title=Giants and Dwarfs: Essays 1960-1990 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York |year=1991 |pages=315–415 |isbn=0-671-74726-6 |oclc= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Paul Wolff]] criticized Rawls from a Marxist perspective in ''Understanding Rawls: A Critique and Reconstruction of A Theory of Justice'' (1977), arguing Rawls offers an apology for the status quo insofar as he constructs justice from existing practice and forecloses the possibility that there may be problems of injustice embedded in capitalist social relations, private property or the market economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Wolff, Robert Paul |authorlink=Robert Paul Wolff |title=Understanding Rawls: A Reconstruction and Critique of A Theory of Justice |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, New Jersey |year=1977 |pages=3–212 |isbn=0-691-01992-4 |oclc= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Sandel]] criticized Rawls in ''[[Liberalism and the Limits of Justice]]'' (1982), arguing that Rawls encourages people to think about justice while divorced from the values and aspirations that define who they are as persons and that allow people to determine what justice is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Sandel, Michael |authorlink=Michael Sandel |title=Liberalism and the Limits of Justice |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=New York |year=1998 |page=14 |isbn=0-521-56741-6 |oclc= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Susan Moller Okin]] wrote in ''Justice, Gender, and the Family'' (1989) that Rawls had provided "the most influential of all twentieth-century theories of justice", but criticized him for failing to account for the injustices and hierarchies embedded in familial relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Okin, Susan Moller |authorlink=Susan Moller Okin |title=Justice, Gender, and the Family |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York |year=1989 |page=9 |isbn=0-465-03703-8 |oclc= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Economists [[Kenneth Arrow]] and [[John Harsanyi]] criticized the assumptions of the original position, and in particular, the use of [[minimax|maximin]] reasoning, with the implication that Rawls' selection of parameters for the original position was result-oriented, ''i.e.'', calculated to derive the two principles that Rawls desired to advance, and/or, as the "contractarian critique" holds, that the persons in the original position articulated by Rawls would not in fact select the principles that ''A Theory of Justice'' advocates.&lt;ref&gt;Arrow, "Some Ordinalist-Utilitarian Notes on Rawls' Theory of Justice, ''Journal of Philosophy'' 70, 9 (May 1973), pp. 245–63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harsanyi, "Can the Maximin Principle Serve as a Basis for Morality? a Critique of John Rawls' Theory, ''American Political Science Review'' 69, 2 (June 1975), pp. 594–606.&lt;/ref&gt; In reply Rawls emphasized the role of the original position as a "device of representation" for making sense of the idea of a fair choice situation for free and equal citizens,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Rawls, John |authorlink=John Rawls |title=Political Liberalism |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |year=2005 |pages=182–83, 261 |isbn=0-231-13089-9 |oclc= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the relatively modest role that maximin plays in his argument: it is "a useful heuristic rule of thumb" given the curious features of choice behind the veil of ignorance.&lt;ref&gt;Rawls, ''Justice as Fairness: a Restatement'', p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

The economist [[Amartya Sen]] has raised concerns over Rawls' emphasis on primary social goods, arguing in ''Inequality Reexamined'' (1992) that we should attend not only to the distribution of primary goods, but also how effectively people are able to use those goods to pursue their ends.&lt;ref&gt;Sen, ''Inequality Reexamined'' (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Norman Daniels]] has wondered why [[health care]] shouldn't be treated as a primary good,&lt;ref&gt;Daniels, "Rights to Health Care: Programmatic Worries," ''Journal of Medicine and Philosophy'' 4, 2 (1979): pp. 174–91.&lt;/ref&gt; and some of his subsequent work has addressed this question, arguing for a right to health care within a broadly Rawlsian framework.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels, ''Just Health Care'' (Cambridge University Press, 1985).&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher [[Gerald Cohen]], in ''If You're An Egalitarian, How Come You're So Rich?'' (2000) and ''Rescuing Justice and Equality'' (2008), criticizes Rawls' avowal of inequality under the [[difference principle]], his application of the principle only to social institutions, and what he sees as his obsession with the using primary goods as his currency of equality.&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sen critiques and attempts to revitalize ''A Theory of Justice'' in ''[[The Idea of Justice]]'' (2009). He credits Rawls for revitalizing the interest in the ideas of what justice means and the stress put on fairness, objectivity, equality of opportunity, removal of poverty, and freedom. However, Sen, as part of his general critique of the contractarian tradition, states that ideas about a perfectly just world do not help redress actual existing inequality. Sen faults Rawls for an over-emphasis on institutions as guarantors of justice not considering the effects of human behaviour on the institutions' ability to maintain a just society. Sen believes Rawls understates the difficulty in getting everyone in society to adhere to the norms of a just society. He also claims that Rawls' position that there be only one possible outcome of the reflective equilibrium behind the veil of ignorance is misguided. Sen believes that multiple conflicting but just principles may arise and that this undermines the multi-step processes that Rawls laid out as leading to a perfectly just society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Sen, Amartya |authorlink=Amartya Sen |title=The Idea of Justice |publisher=Belknap Press (Harvard University Press) |location=New York |year=2009 |pages=52–74 |isbn=978-0-674-06047-0 |oclc= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="890">An '''aporime''' is a problem difficult to resolve, and which has never been resolved, though it may not be, in itself, impossible.

The word is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''{{lang|grc|ἄπορον}}'', which signifies something very difficult and impracticable, being formed from the privative ''α'', and ''{{lang|grc|πόρος}}'', "passage". When a question was proposed to any of the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] philosophers, especially of the sect of [[Academists]], if he could not give a solution, his answer was ''{{lang|grc|ἀποροῶ}}'', q.d. "I do not conceive it; I cannot see through it; I am not able to clear it up."

{{C. S. Peirce articles}}
On May 14, 1867, the 27-year-old [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], who eventually founded [[pragmatism]], presented a paper entitled "[[s:On a New List of Categories|On a New List of Categories]]" to the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]. Among other things, this paper outlined a theory of predication involving three universal '''categories''' that Peirce continued to apply in philosophy and elsewhere for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=Burch&gt;Burch, Robert (2001, 2010), "[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/peirce/ Charles Sanders Peirce]", ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. See §9 "Triadism and the Universal Categories".&lt;/ref&gt;{{example needed}} In the categories one will discern, concentrated, the pattern which one finds formed by the three grades of clearness in "[[s:How to Make Our Ideas Clear|How to Make Our Ideas Clear]]"  (1878 foundational paper for pragmatism), and in numerous other three-way distinctions in his work.

==The Categories==

In Aristotle's logic, [[Categories (Aristotle)|categories]] are adjuncts to reasoning that are designed to resolve equivocations, ambiguities that make expressions or signs recalcitrant to being ruled by logic. Categories help the reasoner to render signs ready for the application of logical laws. An equivocation is a variation in meaning — a manifold of sign senses — such that, as Aristotle put it about names in the opening of ''[[Wikisource:Categories|Categories]]'' (1.1&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;1–12), "Things are said to be named ‘equivocally’ when, though they have a common name, the definition corresponding with the name differs for each". So Peirce's claim that three categories are sufficient amounts to an assertion that all manifolds of meaning can be unified in just three steps.

The following passage is critical to the understanding of Peirce's Categories:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I will now say a few words about what you have called Categories, but for which I prefer the designation Predicaments, and which you have explained as predicates of predicates.

That wonderful operation of [[hypostatic abstraction]] by which we seem to create ''entia rationis'' that are, nevertheless, sometimes real, furnishes us the means of turning predicates from being signs that we think or think ''through'', into being subjects thought of. We thus think of the thought-sign itself, making it the object of another thought-sign.

Thereupon, we can repeat the operation of hypostatic abstraction, and from these second intentions derive third intentions. Does this series proceed endlessly? I think not. What then are the characters of its different members?

My thoughts on this subject are not yet harvested. I will only say that the subject concerns Logic, but that the divisions so obtained must not be confounded with the different Modes of Being: Actuality, Possibility, Destiny (or Freedom from Destiny).

On the contrary, the succession of Predicates of Predicates is different in the different Modes of Being. Meantime, it will be proper that in our system of diagrammatization we should provide for the division, whenever needed, of each of our three Universes of modes of reality into Realms for the different Predicaments. (Peirce 1906&lt;ref&gt;p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=3KoLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA3-PA523&amp;#PRA3-PA522,M1 522], "Prolegomena to an Apology for Pragmaticism", The ''Monist'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=3KoLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA3-PA523&amp;#PRA3-PA473,M1 vol. XVI, no. 4], Oct. 1906, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=3KoLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA3-PA523&amp;#PRA3-PA492,M1 492]–546, reprinted in the ''Collected Papers'' vol 4, paragraphs 530–572, see [http://www.existentialgraphs.com/peirceoneg/prolegomena.htm#Paragraph549 paragraph 549]&lt;/ref&gt;).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The first thing to extract from this passage is the fact that Peirce's Categories, or "Predicaments", are predicates of predicates. Meaningful predicates have both ''[[Extension (semantics)|extension]]'' and ''[[intension]]'', so predicates of predicates get their meanings from at least two sources of information, namely, the classes of relations and the qualities of qualities to which they refer. Considerations like these tend to generate hierarchies of subject matters, extending through what is traditionally called the ''logic of second intentions'',&lt;ref&gt;Such "intentions" are more like [[intension]]s than like aims or purposings.&lt;/ref&gt; or what is handled very roughly by ''[[second order logic]]'' in contemporary parlance, and continuing onward through higher intensions, or ''[[higher order logic]]'' and ''[[type theory]]''.

Peirce arrived at his own system of three categories after a thoroughgoing study of his predecessors, with special reference to the categories of Aristotle, Kant, and Hegel. The names that he used for his own categories varied with context and occasion, but ranged from reasonably intuitive terms like ''quality'', ''reaction'', and ''representation'' to maximally abstract terms like ''firstness'', ''secondness'', and ''thirdness'', respectively. Taken in full generality, ''nth''-ness can be understood as referring to those properties that all ''n''-adic relations have in common. Peirce's distinctive claim is that a type hierarchy of three levels is generative of all that we need in logic.

Part of the justification for Peirce's claim that three categories are both necessary and sufficient appears to arise from mathematical ideas about the [[Relation reduction|reducibility]] of ''n''-adic relations. According to Peirce's Reduction Thesis,&lt;ref&gt;See "The Logic of Relatives," The ''Monist'', Vol. 7, 1897, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=pa0LAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA554&amp;#PPA161,M1 161]-217, see [https://books.google.com/books?id=pa0LAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA554&amp;#PPA183,M1 p. 183] (via Google Books with registration apparently not required). Reprinted in the ''Collected Papers'', vol. 3, paragraphs 456-552, see paragraph 483.&lt;/ref&gt; (a) triads are necessary because genuinely triadic relations cannot be completely analyzed in terms of monadic and dyadic predicates, and (b) triads are sufficient because there are no genuinely tetradic or larger polyadic relations—all higher-[[arity]] ''n''-adic relations can be analyzed in terms of triadic and lower-arity relations. Others, notably Robert Burch (1991) and Joachim Hereth Correia and Reinhard Pöschel (2006), have offered proofs of the Reduction Thesis.&lt;ref&gt;* Burch, Robert (1991), ''A Peircean Reduction Thesis: The Foundations of Topological Logic'', Texas Tech University Press, Lubbock, TX

John F. Sowa in the same discussion [http://www.nabble.com/Re%3A-Peircean-Reduction-Thesis-Was%3A-CG%3A-typical-distribution-of-arities--p11712058.html claimed] that an explanation in terms of conceptual graphs is sufficiently convincing about the Reduction Thesis for those without the time to understand what Peirce was saying.

There have been proposals by Donald Mertz, Herbert Schneider, Carl Hausman, and Carl Vaught to augment Peirce's threefolds to fourfolds; and one by Douglas Greenlee to reduce them to twofolds.&lt;ref&gt;For references and discussion, see Burgess, Paul (circa 1988) "Why Triadic?: Challenges to the Structure of Peirce's Semiotic"; posted by [[Joseph Morton Ransdell|Joseph M. Ransdell]] at ''[http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/aboutcsp/pr-main.htm#Burgess Arisbe]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Peirce introduces his Categories and their theory in [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/newlist/nl-frame.htm "On a New List of Categories" (1867)], a work which is cast as a Kantian deduction and is short but dense and difficult to summarize. The following table is compiled from that and later works.
{{C. S. Peirce categorial table}}
(The context for interpretants is not psychology or sociology, but instead philosophical logic. In a sense, an interpretant is whatever can be understood as a conclusion of an inference. The context for the categories as categories is phenomenology, which Peirce also called phaneroscopy and categorics.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3572">'''Creative journalism''' refers to a journalistic story than has been enhanced in an creative way by the journalist, possibly with an intent to mislead or with an objective to cause an event to happen that otherwise would not.

==Etymology==

''Creative journalism'' has sometimes been applied to newly identified genres until a definitive designated is settled upon.

==Meanings==

===Linking creative writing and journalism===

One usage of the term ''creative journalism'' is to cover an overlap between ''creating writing'' and ''journalism'' that occurs in the [[feature writing]], [[narrative literature]] and whatever.  ''Journalism'' is the factual portrayal of news and events with minimal analysis and interpretation.  By contrast ''creative'' is original expressive and imaginative. [[Creative writing]] refers to imagination

The UNICEF indicated it wished to celebrate ''creative journalism'' by was of the Meena Media award, though the award is mainly divided into ''creative'' and ''journalistic'' categories.&lt;ref name="Meena"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unicef.org/bangladesh/media_9012.html|access-date=23 February 2018|title=Meena Media Award 2014: Celebrating 10 Years of Media Excellence in Advancing Child Rights|website=[[UNICEF]]|dead-url=no|archive-date=23 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180223084201/https://www.unicef.org/bangladesh/media_9012.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Created story===

[[Hugh Cudlipp]] has defined creative journalism differently, ''as the art of causing something to occur that would not otherwise materialise'' and the antithesis of the ''phantom scoop'' where the foretold event does not occur.  He also puts it as ''making news not faking news''&lt;ref name="Chewy"&gt;{{cite book|title=Newspapermen: Hugh Cudlipp, Cecil Harmsworth King and the Glory Days of Fleet Street|first=Ruth|last=Dudley Edwards|isbn=978-0436199929|date=1 May 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This definition has been alluded to by others.&lt;ref name=OxDictEuphanisms&gt;{{cite book|title=A Dictionary of Euphemisms|last=Holder|first=W.B.|page=28|date=25 September 2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0199235179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creative presentation===

''Creative journalism'' can be applied to a journalistic work that has creative presentation.  Used this way if will often be used to denote a praiseworthy example of [[photojournalism]], [[visual journalism]] or [[graphic journalism]].

===Euphemism===

The euphemism for ''Creative journalism'' refers to the similar use of 'creative' in ''[[creative accounting]]''.  Here creative is used in the sense to mislead. The term has elements of relationship to [[tabloid journalism]], [[yellow journalism]] and [[fakes news]], though there are differences in emphasis and objectives.  A significant difference from [[clickbait]] is the former but form emphasis on the story.

==What creative journalism is not==

Creative journalism does not occur when the source(s) are incorrect or as a result of [[Spin (propaganda)|spin propaganda]] providing the journalist has not knowingly colluded or negligently failed to check sources.&lt;ref name="CJ-or-Spin"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2014/oct/31/daily-record-scottish-independence|title='The Vow' and the Daily Record - creative journalism or political spin?|date=31 October 2014|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor '''David Grainger Marcus Wood-Gush''' [[FRSE]] (20 November 1922–1 December 1992) was a South African-born animal geneticist and [[Ethology|ethologist]] based for most of his professional life in [[Edinburgh]]. He was an expert on animal behaviour and academic author in this field. He was one of the first to study the impacts of [[factory farming]]. He advocated the study of animal behaviour to gauge what implied "humane treatment" for different species, and tried to balance these factors against economic viability for the farmer. He looked at the impact of stress upon animals and held that animals should be treated as individuals not as a "commodity". In these studies he concluded that food supply was the essential factor in controlling animal behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;The Scotsman (newspaper) obituary 8 December 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

He was one of the first to both see the benefits of and physically introduce the concept of [[free range]] farming.

==Life==

He was born in [[Transkei]] in [[South Africa]] on 20 November 1922 into a Quaker family of British origin. He was educated at [[Grahamstown]]. His university career was interrupted by the [[Second World War]] during which he served in North Africa in the [[South African Air Force]] as a navigator in a bombing crew. He lost his lower left arm in 1944 whilst home on leave, due to a motorcycle accident where he was riding pillion. The driver, his friend, the pilot of his bombing crew, was killed in the accident. David was plagued by phantom pains in the missing hand for all his life.

After the war he studied Science at Witwatersrand University, graduating BSc in 1948. Increasing despairing at his county’s politics and [[apartheid]] policy, he left in 1949, going to the [[University of Edinburgh]] (which had a growing reputation in the field of genetics) as a postgraduate where he gained both a doctorate in 1952 (PhD) and a Diploma in Animal Genetics (studying under Prof [[Conrad Hal Waddington]] and Dr [[Alan William Greenwood]]). He thereafter began work at the Poultry Research Centre. Due to his personal limb loss he did much research to establish if animals might feel similar phantom pains to his own due to actions such as dehorning  etc. He was always concerned of potential pain and animal suffering in various procedures.
In 1975 he conducted an infamous experiment on a remote Scottish island, re-wilding domesticated chickens to measure how they survived. Unfortunately all were killed by a resident population of escaped [[mink]]. In 1976 he repeated the experiment somewhat more successfully using pigs.

In 1978 the Poultry Research Centre decided to relocate to [[Roslin, Midlothian]] and began more industry-based research. Given David’s disapproval of this and his lack of driving licence (due to his missing arm) making it very difficult to reach this remote site. He moved to more academic roles in Edinburgh instead. In 1978 he began teaching Applied Animal Behaviour at the [[University of Edinburgh]]&lt;ref&gt;Independent (newspaper) obituary: 10 February 1993&lt;/ref&gt; He was given an Honorary Professorship by the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1981. In the same year he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]. His proposers were [[Noel Farnie Robertson]], [[Aubrey Manning]], [[John Mitchison]], [[Peter M. B. Walker]], Peter McDonald and John E. Dale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783 – 2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1984 to 1987 he was President of the Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. He was also Chairman of the International Society of Applied Ethology. During this period he famously set up the "Edinburgh Pig Park" investigating the benefits of free range pork.&lt;ref name="researchgate"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248335852_David_Wood-Gush_The_Biography_of_an_Ethology_Mentor|title=David Wood-Gush: The Biography of an Ethology Mentor &amp;#124; Request PDF|website=researchgate.net|accessdate=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died of a heart attack while checking into a hotel for a conference&lt;ref&gt;The Scotsman (newspaper) obituary 8 December 1992&lt;/ref&gt; in [[London]] on 1 December 1992. His body was cremated and his ashes were scattered in the sea near his birthplace of [[Transkei]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/obits_alpha/wood-gush_david.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The University created a '''Wood-Gush Memorial Lecture''' in his memory.

==Family==
He married Eola in 1953. They had a daughter Amynta (born 1957) and son Guy (born 1958).

'''Demeter International''' is the largest certification organization for [[biodynamic agriculture]], and is one of three predominant organic certifiers.&lt;ref name=coffee&gt;Commission for Environmental Cooperation and TerraChoice Environmental Services Inc, ''Environmental and Other Labelling of Coffee: the role of mutual recognition, supporting cooperative action'', May 2004.

Demeter Biodynamic Certification is used in over 50 countries to verify that biodynamic products meet international standards in production and processing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140530033038/http://biodynamic.org.nz/demeter.html Demeter certification in New Zealand]&lt;/ref&gt; The Demeter certification program was established in 1928, and as such was the first ecological label for organically produced foods.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Diver, ''Biodynamic Farming &amp; Compost Preparation'', Alternative Farming Systems Guide: ATTRA, February 1999. [http://attra.ncat.org/attra-pub/PDF/biodynam.pdf Document text]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
Certification is difficult to come by and must be renewed annually.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metroactive.com/papers/sonoma/08.31.05/dining-0535.html ''Biodynamic Berries: Ancient ways are the next step in organic winemaking'']&lt;/ref&gt; Demeter’s “biodynamic” certification requires biodiversity and ecosystem preservation, soil husbandry, livestock integration, prohibition of genetically engineered organisms and viewing the farm as a living “holistic organism”.&lt;ref name=coffee/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://demeter-usa.org/?page_id=5 Overview of Demeter certification requirements] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070730185553/http://demeter-usa.org/?page_id=5 |date=2007-07-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The certification verifies the fulfillment of the standards on behalf of the farmers, which in turn guarantees high quality food products to the consumers. This is rewarded by receiving a higher price for food certified with the “Demeter” label, ranging from 10-30% on average.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan Rist and Lucas Rist, "Towards a post-materialist understanding of science – lessons learnt form the interface of biodynamic agriculture and research."

== History ==

The origin of Demeter is a Cooperative for the processing of products of the [[biodynamic agriculture]] created in Berlin, Germany, in 1927. The trademark Demeter was registered in 1928. Demeter was administered by the German agronomist Erhard Bartsch who also directed the Experimental Circle of anthroposophical (biodynamic) farmers, and who had chosen the name Demeter, jointly with the German chemist Franz Dreidax. Dreidax was responsible for the development of the Demeter criteria and the quality control.

The Demeter name was adopted internationally. In Australia, two members of the Experimental Circle, Ernesto Genoni and Ileen Macpherson founded Demeter Biological Farm in Melbourne in 1934 and operated it as a biodynamic farm for two decades (until 1954).&lt;ref&gt;John Paull (2017) [https://www.academia.edu/31572839/Ileen_Macpherson_Life_and_tragedy_of_a_pioneer_of_biodynamic_farming_at_Demeter_Farm_and_a_benefactor_of_Anthroposophy_in_Australia  Ileen Macpherson: Life and tragedy of a pioneer of biodynamic farming at Demeter Farm and a benefactor of Anthroposophy in Australia], Journal of Organics, 4(1):29-56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Paull (2017) [http://orgprints.org/32143/1/Paull2017.Demeter.JBDT.pdf Australia’s original Demeter Farm (1934-1954)], Journal of Biodynamics Tasmania, 123:16-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Demeter ceased temporarily to exist in 1941 when the Nazi Government dissolved the Union for biodynamic agriculture. It was reestablished in Germany after the Second World War. In 1997 19 independent Demeter organisations came together to establish Demeter International. All continents were represented.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

      <comment>I removed "exorcisms" from the list of rituals in the second paragraph of the Rituals section.  As far as I'm aware, the EGC does not formally recognize the existence of possession or practice any formal or informal exorcism ritual. Also, after checking the reference source, there is no exorcism ritual listed in the source material.</comment>

{{Thelema}}
'''Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica''' ('''E.G.C.'''), or the '''Gnostic Catholic Church''', is a [[Gnostic]] [[Christian denomination|church]] organization. It is the ecclesiastical arm of the [[Ordo Templi Orientis]] (O.T.O.), an international fraternal initiatory organization devoted to promulgating the Law of [[Thelema]].

Thelema is a philosophical, mystical and religious system elaborated by [[Aleister Crowley]], and based on ''[[The Book of the Law]]''. The word ''Catholic'' denotes the universality of doctrine and not a [[Christian Church|Christian]] or [[Roman Catholic]] belief set.

The chief function of ''Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica'' is the public and private performance of [[the Gnostic Mass]] (''Liber XV''), a eucharistic ritual written by Crowley in 1913. According to William Bernard Crow, Crowley wrote the Gnostic Mass "under the influence of the [[Liturgy of St. Basil]] of the Russian Church".&lt;ref&gt;W. B. Crow quoted in T. Apiryon, [http://www.hermetic.com/sabazius/intromass.htm Introduction to the Gnostic Mass].&lt;/ref&gt; Its structure is also influenced by the initiatory rituals of the ''Ordo Templi Orientis''.&lt;ref&gt;King, Francis (1973). ''Secret Rituals of the O.T.O.'' New York: Samuel Weiser. {{ISBN|0-87728-144-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its most notable separation from similar rites of other churches is a Priestess officiating with a Priest, Deacon, and two Children. In addition to the Eucharist, baptism, confirmation, marriage, and last rites are offered by E.G.C. Marriage is not limited to couples of opposite gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

About the Gnostic Mass, Crowley wrote in ''[[The Confessions of Aleister Crowley]]'', "... the Ritual of the Gnostic Catholic Church ... I prepared for the use of the O.T.O., the central ceremony of its public and private celebration, corresponding to the Mass of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

| last = Crowley

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the single most commonly performed ritual at O.T.O. bodies, with many locations celebrating the Mass monthly or more frequently. Most O.T.O. bodies make some or all of these celebrations open to interested members of the public, so the Mass is often an individual's first experience of the O.T.O.

''Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica'' has a hierarchical structure of clergy, assisting officers, and laity which parallels the degree structure of the O.T.O. initiatory system. Before 1997, the two systems were more loosely correlated, but since then there have been strict rules concerning minimum O.T.O. degrees required to serve in particular E.G.C. roles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oto-usa.org/egc.html#member U.S. Grand Lodge: Membership in E.G.C.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2016}}
Membership in ''Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica'' is similar to the Roman Catholic Church, with some important differences. As currently constituted, E.G.C. includes both clergy and laity. Clergy must be initiate members of O.T.O., while laity may affiliate to E.G.C. through [[baptism]] and [[confirmation]] without undertaking any of the degree initiations of the Order.

Novice clergy are initiate members who participate in the administration of E.G.C. [[sacrament]]s, although they have not yet taken orders (i.e., been through a ceremony of ordination).

The first ordination in E.G.C. is that of the diaconate. Second Degree initiates of O.T.O. who have been confirmed in E.G.C. can be ordained as Deacons, whose principal duties are to assist the Priesthood.

The sacerdotal ordination admits members to the priesthood. Sacerdotal ordinands must hold at least the K.E.W. degree of O.T.O., a degree only available by invitation. The Priesthood is responsible for administering the sacraments through the Gnostic Mass and other ceremonies as authorized by their supervising Bishops.

The Priesthood is supervised and instructed by the Episcopate, or Bishops. Full initiation to the Seventh Degree of O.T.O. includes episcopal consecration in E.G.C. The Tenth Degree Supreme and Holy King serves as the Primate or chief Bishop for any country in which O.T.O. has organized a Grand Lodge. The Frater (or Soror) Superior of O.T.O. is also the Patriarch (Matriarch) of the Church, with ultimate authority over the clergy.

==Rituals==
The principal ritual of ''Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica'' is [[the Gnostic Mass]], a Eucharistic ceremony written by [[Aleister Crowley]] in 1913. [[Theodor Reuss]] produced and authorized a German translation in 1918.

The text of the Gnostic Mass makes reference to ceremonies of baptism, confirmation, and marriage. Crowley left some notes towards a baptism ritual, and his "''Liber CVI''" was written for use in a last rites circumstance. The Bishops of the contemporary Church have developed rituals for all of these purposes, as well as infant benedictions, consecration of holy oil, funerals, and home administration of the Eucharist to the sick.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

| title = Rituals
| work = The Invisible Basilica
| accessdate = 2011-07-19
| url = http://hermetic.com/sabazius/rituals.html
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although some Gnostic Masses are held privately for initiates only, there is nothing 'secret' about E.G.C. rituals as such, and they are commonly open to the public.

==Saints of Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica==
The Gnostic Saints of ''Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica'' are a series of historical and mythological figures revered in the religion of Thelema. They are found in the fifth Collect of Liber XV, titled "The Saints".

Two Gnostic Saints have been officially added to the original list. [[William Blake]] was so recognized based on a discovered writing by Aleister Crowley which described him as such.&lt;ref&gt;Helena and Tau Apiryon [http://www.hermetic.com/sabazius/gmnotes.htm#Blake The Gnostic Mass: Annotations and Commentary] (footnote). ''Ordo Templi Orientis'', 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Giordano Bruno]] was more recently added to the list.&lt;ref&gt;Sabazius. "From the Grand Master" in [http://lib.oto-usa.org/agape/agape.9.1.pdf Agape, V. 9, No. 1], p. 3. Ordo Templi Orientis, May 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The ''Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica'' descended from a line of French Gnostic revival churches that developed in the 19th century. At that time, these Gnostic churches were essentially Christian in nature. In 1907, [[Gerard Encausse]], [[Jean Bricaud]] and Louis-Sophrone Fugairon founded their own, simply called the Gnostic Catholic Church. In 1908, they gave O.T.O. Grand Master Theodor Reuss episcopal consecration and primatial authority in their GCC. Later that year, Reuss incorporated the Gnostic Catholic Church into O.T.O. after the original founders renamed their own church to the Universal Gnostic Church.

The name "''Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica''" was not applied to the church until Crowley wrote the Gnostic Mass in 1913, which Reuss proclaimed to be the church's official rite. This marked the first time an established church was to accept the Law of Thelema as its central doctrine. Reuss then announced a new title for himself: the "Sovereign Patriarch and Primate of the Gnostic Catholic Church".{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

In 1979, Hymenaeus Alpha X° ([[Grady McMurtry]]) separated ''Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica'' from ''Ordo Templi Orientis'', and made it into an independent organization, with himself at the head of both. During this period of separation ''Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica'' published its own quarterly magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Ecclesia Gnostica: a bibliographical note| accessdate = 2009-11-25| url = http://mo.thelemistas.org/ecclesiagnostica/}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1986, his successor, [[Hymenaeus Beta]], dissolved the separate Gnostic Catholic Church corporation and folded the church back into O.T.O. Since then the Church has expanded greatly, and in recent years several books and articles dealing with the E.G.C. and the Gnostic Mass have been published by its Clergy, notably by Tau Apiryon &amp; Tau Helena,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| edition = 2nd| publisher = Red Flame| isbn = 0-9712376-1-1| last = T Apiryon|author2=Helena| title = Mystery of Mystery: A Primer of Thelemic Ecclesiastical Gnosticism| series = Red Flame| date = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Wasserman]] &amp; Nancy Wasserman,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| edition = 2nd Revised

==The Gnostic Creed==
A creed is a statement of belief—usually religious belief—or faith. The word derives from the Latin ''credo'' for "I believe". The creed of Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica—also known as the '''Gnostic Creed'''—is recited in the Gnostic Mass, during the Ceremony of the Introit.

The text of the Creed is as follows:

::I believe in one secret and ineffable LORD; and in one Star in the Company of Stars of whose fire we are created, and to which we shall return; and in one Father of Life, Mystery of Mystery, in His name [[Chaos (cosmogony)|CHAOS]], the sole vicegerent of the Sun upon the Earth; and in one Air the nourisher of all that breathes.

::And I believe in one Earth, the Mother of us all, and in one Womb wherein all men are begotten, and wherein they shall rest, Mystery of Mystery, in Her name [[Babalon|BABALON]].

::And I believe in the Serpent and the Lion, Mystery of Mystery, in His name [[Baphomet|BAPHOMET]].

::And I believe in one Gnostic and Catholic Church of Light, Life, Love and Liberty, the Word of whose Law is THELEMA.

::And I believe in the communion of Saints.

::And, forasmuch as meat and drink are transmuted in us daily into spiritual substance, I believe in the Miracle of the Mass.

::And I confess one Baptism of Wisdom whereby we accomplish the Miracle of Incarnation.

::And I confess my life one, individual, and eternal that was, and is, and is to come.

::AUMGN. AUMGN. AUMGN.

===Explication of the Creed===
The first six articles profess several beliefs by the congregants. The remaining two are confessions. The Creed ends with the Thelemic form of the Pranava, equivalent to the sacred Vedic syllable "[[Om|Aum]]" or to the "[[Amen]]" of the [[Judaeo-Christian]] tradition. On the basic form of the Creed, Tau Apiryon and Helena (1998) write:

:The first 4 clauses are attributed to the four letters of [[Tetragrammaton]] YHVH: the Father (Chaos); the Mother (Babalon); the Union of Father and Mother in the Son (Baphomet); and the Daughter, the Bride of the Son (the Church). The two following clauses describe the essential products of the Mass from the perspective of the congregation. The final two clauses are in the form of confession rather than belief and describe parallels between the occurrences in the Mass and the life of the individual.

'''Existential humanism''' is humanism that validates the human subject as struggling for self-knowledge and self-responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;G. B. Messer/A. S. Gurman, ''Essential Psychotherapies'' (2011) p. 261-2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concepts==

[[Søren Kierkegaard]] suggested that the best use of our capacity for making choices is to freely choose to live a fully human life, rooted in a personal search for values, rather than an external code.&lt;ref&gt;G. B. Messer/A. S. Gurman, ''Essential Psychotherapies'' (2011) p. 261-2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean-Paul Sartre]] said "[[Existentialism and Humanism|existentialism is a humanism]]" because it expresses the power of human beings to make freely-willed choices, independent of the influence of religion or society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/sartre/works/exist/sartre.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike traditional humanisms, however, Sartre disavowed any reliance on an essential nature of man – on deriving values from the facts of human nature – but rather saw human value as self-created through undertaking projects in the world: experiments in living.&lt;ref&gt;B. Leiter/M. Rosen eds., ''The Oxford Handbook of Continental Philosophy'' (2007) p. 674-7 and p. 691&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[Albert Camus]], in his book ''[[The Plague]]'', suggests that some of us may choose to be heroic, even knowing that it will bring us neither reward nor salvation;{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} and [[Simone de Beauvoir]], in her book ''[[The Ethics of Ambiguity]]'', argues that embracing our own personal freedom requires us to fight for the freedoms of all humanity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/ethics/de-beauvoir/ambiguity/index.htm Ethics of Ambiguity by Simone de Beauvoir]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

[[Martin Heidegger]] attacked Sartre's concept of existential humanism in his ''[[Letter on Humanism]]'' of 1946, accusing Sartre of elevating [[Reason]] above [[Being]].&lt;ref&gt;E. Roudinesco, ''Jacques Lacan'' (2005) p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michel Foucault]] followed Heidegger in attacking Sartre's humanism as a kind of theology of man,&lt;ref&gt;G. Gutting ed., ''The Cambridge Companion to Foucault'' (2003) p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; though in his emphasis on the self-creation of the human being he has in fact been seen as very close to Sartre's existential humanism.&lt;ref&gt;B. Leiter/M. Rosen eds., ''The Oxford Handbook of Continental Philosophy'' (2007) p. 702&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''God, A Guide for the Perplexed''''' is a non-fiction book by [[Keith Ward]] arguing the compatibility between [[science]] and [[religion]]. 

In seven chapters [[Keith Ward]] takes the reader through the history of mankind's religious thought. He shows how philosophical questions have always been linked with religious questions, and how religion has never been merely a set of rules or doctrines, but a quest for meaning and a search for the blazing darkness that is God. Ward also discusses [[Hegel]] and [[Karl Marx]].  While the academic ground is covered lightly, the mystical, poetic and mysterious side of religion is also given due weight. The content is similar to, though the tone adopted is different from, [[Don Cupitt]]'s ''[[The Sea of Faith]]''.

'''Gorochana''' (Tibetan: gi-wang) refers to a stone or '[[bezoar]]' found in [[cattle]] (Sanskrit - "''go''"), such as the bull, cow, ox, and yak. Its presence in the animal is reputedly indicated by the snoring or other nocturnal sounds made by the animal in its sleep.&lt;ref&gt;The Handbook of Tibetan Buddhist Symbols, Serindia Publications, Inc., 2003, Page 20&lt;/ref&gt;  Its equivalent in [[Sinitic]] culture is [[calculus bovis]].

== Vedic legend ==
Legend has it that [[Indra]] once cast the five precious minerals: gold, silver, coral, pearl, and either sapphire or turquoise, into the great ocean. These were eventually consumed by various animals, which then formed bezoars within their bodies. They have different colors and potencies based on the animal they originate from.

==Medicinal properties ==
Reputedly, Gorochana acts as an antidote to poisons, promotes clear thoughts, and alleviates fevers and contagious diseases. The superior, mediocre, and inferior forms of these stones are reputed to respectively cure seven, five, or three patients who have been poisoned. In medieval European medical traditions [[bezoars]] were highly esteemed as an antidote to poisoning. 'Oriental bezoars' obtained from the East were particularly prized ones.
In India, A drop of Gorochana will be given along with mothers milk on 11th day of the baby’s birth. It will help to tremendously enhance voice clarity for babies.

== Source and other properties ==
Gorochana of the finest quality is supposedly obtained from the brain or forehead of an elephant, and the second best quality is obtained from the stomach of a cow. Resembling the yellow yolk of a boiled egg, the yellow pigment obtained from a Gorochana is used as a tonic, sedative or [[tilaka]] to the forehead. The gray or white stone obtained from the hood of a king cobra is believed to enable a snake charmer to control all lesser serpents, and also to bestow immunity against venom.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5896">'''Harald Krabbe Schjelderup''' (21 May 1895 &amp;ndash; 19 August 1974) was a Norwegian physicist, philosopher and psychologist. He worked with all three subjects on university level, but is best remembered as Norway's first professor of psychology.

He was born in [[Dypvåg]] as a son of bishop [[Kristian Vilhelm Koren Schjelderup, Sr.|Kristian Schjelderup]] (1853–1913) and Hendy Hassel (1855–1922). He was a brother of [[Kristian Vilhelm Koren Schjelderup, Jr.|Kristian Schjelderup, Jr]], he too a bishop. He [[examen artium|finished]] his secondary education at [[Kristiansand Cathedral School]] in 1912, and graduated in [[physics]] from the [[University of Oslo|Royal Frederick University]]. Here he also worked as research assistant of [[Lars Vegard]]. He also worked with [[anatomy]], [[microscopy]] and [[philosophy]]. He released the paper ''Hovedlinjer i filosofiens utvikling fra midten av det 19. århundre til nutiden'' in 1916, and was hired as a [[research fellow]] in philosophy in 1917. In line with the tendency of the day, his philosophy was [[positivism|positivist]] and crossed into psychology. He studied [[experimental psychology]] in [[University of Copenhagen|Copenhagen]] and [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]], and took the [[dr.philos.]] degree in 1919 with the thesis ''Til sansefornæmmelsernes psykofysiologi''. He then studied in [[Berlin]] and [[Freiburg]], and was appointed as a professor in 1922. After six years as a professor of philosophy, he became Norway's first professor of psychology in 1928. He worked at the Royal Frederick University (from 1939: the University of Oslo).&lt;ref name=nbl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Harald K Schjelderup|encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Håvard|last=Nilsen|editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]] |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Harald_K_Schjelderup/utdypning|language=Norwegian |accessdate=13 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among other things, Schjelderup learned [[psychoanalysis]]. He helped persons like [[Otto Fenichel]] and [[Wilhelm Reich]] to migrate from [[Nazi Germany]] to Norway. Then, after [[Operation Weserübung|Nazi Germany invaded Norway]] in 1940, Schjelderup became leader of the university's ''Aksjonsutvalget'', a [[Norwegian resistance movement|resistance]] committee.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; Open protests ensued when the Nazi authorities were about to change the rules for admission to the university in autumn 1943.

'''Human Rights Day''' is celebrated annually across the world on 10 December every year.

The date was chosen to honour the [[United Nations General Assembly]]'s adoption and proclamation, on 10 December 1948, of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR), the first global enunciation of [[human rights]] and one of the first major achievements of the new [[United Nations]]. The formal establishment of Human Rights Day occurred at the 317th Plenary Meeting of the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] on 4 December 1950, when the General Assembly declared resolution 423(V), inviting all member states and any other interested organizations to celebrate the day as they saw fit.&lt;ref&gt;{{UN document |docid=A/RES/423(V) |session=5 |type=Resolution |body=General Assembly |resolution_number=423(V) |url=http://daccess-ods.un.org/access.nsf/Get?OpenAgent&amp;DS=A/RES/423(V)&amp;Lang=E&amp;Area=RESOLUTION |accessdate=29 October 2009 |date=4 December 1950 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HumanRightsDay.aspx |title=The History of Human Rights Day |accessdate=29 October 2009 |author=Office of the High Commission for Human Rights |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The day is normally marked both by high-level political conferences and meetings and by cultural events and exhibitions dealing with human rights issues. In addition it is traditionally on 10 December that the five-yearly [[United Nations Prize in the Field of Human Rights]] and [[Nobel Peace Prize]] are awarded. Many [[international organization|governmental]] and [[non-governmental organizations]] active in the human rights field also schedule special events to commemorate the day, as do many civil and social-cause organizations.

==History==
[[File:Turkish journalists protesting imprisonment of their colleagues in 2016.jpg|thumb|Turkish journalists protesting [[Turkey's media purge after the failed July 2016 coup d'état|imprisonment]] of their colleagues, 10 December 2016]]
Human Rights Day is the day in 1948 the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.ibtimes.co.in/human-rights-day-best-quotes-by-famous-personalities-mark-un-day-658792|title = Human Rights Day: Best Quotes By Famous Personalities to Mark UN Day|last = James|first = Anu|date = 9 December 2015|work = International Business Times|access-date = 9 December 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The formal inception of Human Rights Day dates from 1950, after the Assembly passed resolution 423(V) inviting all States and interested organizations to adopt 10 December of each year as Human Rights Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Encyclopedia of Human Rights|last = Lawson|first = Edward|publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis|year = 1996|isbn = 9781560323624|location = |pages = 722–724|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=J-SrdFtSuDUC&amp;lpg=PA723&amp;dq=%22human%20rights%20day%22&amp;pg=PA723#v=onepage&amp;q=%22human%20rights%20day%22&amp;f=false|edition = 2nd|others = Research and contributing editor, Jan K. Dargel}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of the day can be shown by the fact that the commemorative Human Rights Day stamp issued by the [[United Nations Postal Administration]] in 1952, received approximately 200,000 advance orders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = United Nations and Human Rights|last = Green|first = James Frederick|publisher = The Brookings Institution|year = 1956|isbn = |location = |pages = 676|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=wI58IE-n4H0C&amp;lpg=PA676&amp;dq=%22human%20rights%20day%22&amp;pg=PA676#v=onepage&amp;q=%22human%20rights%20day%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the General Assembly adopted the Declaration, with 48 states in favor and eight abstentions, it was proclaimed as a "common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations", towards which individuals and societies should "strive by progressive measures, national and international, to secure their universal and effective recognition and observance". The measure was received by both advocates and critics alike as "being more declarative than legislative, more suggestive than binding."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Human Rights in the Twentieth Century|last = Cohen|first = G. Daniel|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2011|isbn = 9780521194266|location = |pages = 49–50|editor-last = Hoffmann|editor-first = Stefan-Ludwig|chapter = The 'Human Rights Revolution' at Work: Displaced Persons in Postwar Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Declaration with its broad range of [[civil and political rights|political, civil]], [[economic, social and cultural rights]] is not a binding document, it inspired more than 60 human rights instruments which together constitute an international standard of human rights. Today the general consent of all United Nations Member States on the basic Human Rights laid down in the Declaration makes it even stronger and emphasizes the relevance of Human Rights in our{{who|date=December 2017}} daily lives.{{according to whom|date=December 2017}}

The High Commissioner for Human Rights, as the main United Nations rights official, and his Office play a major role in coordinating efforts for the yearly observation of Human Rights Day:

{{quote|Today, poverty prevails as the gravest human rights challenge in the world. Combating poverty, deprivation and exclusion is not a matter of charity, and it does not depend on how rich a country is. By tackling poverty as a matter of human rights obligation, the world will have a better chance of abolishing this scourge in our lifetime... [[poverty reduction|Poverty eradication]] is an achievable goal.|[[UN High Commissioner for Human Rights]] [[Louise Arbour]], 10 December 2006}}

The 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights occurred on 10 December 2008, and the UN Secretary-General launched a year-long campaign leading up to this anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.un.org/en/events/humanrightsday/udhr60/|title = The Universal Declaration of Human Rights: 1948–2008|date = 2008|accessdate = 9 December 2015|website = United Nations|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the UDHR holds the world record as the most translated document (except for the Bible), organizations around the globe used the year to focus on helping people everywhere learn about their rights.

On 9 December 2001, [[United States President|President]] [[George W. Bush]] made a [[Presidential proclamation]] that Human Rights Week began on 9 December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=[[White House Office of the Press Secretary|Office of the Press Secretary]]|title=Human Rights Day, Bill of Rights Day, and Human Rights Week, 2001|url=https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2001/12/12/01-30834/human-rights-day-bill-of-rights-day-and-human-rights-week-2001|work=[[Federal Register]]|publisher=[[Federal Government of the United States]]|location=[[Washington, D.C.]]|date=12 December 2001|accessdate=11 March 2017|archiveurl=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2001-12-12/pdf/01-30834.pdf|archivedate=12 December 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also made the same proclamation on 10 December 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=[[White House Office of the Press Secretary|Office of the Press Secretary]]|title=Human Rights Day, Bill of Rights Day, and Human Rights Week, 2008|url=https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2008/12/12/E8-29704/human-rights-day-bill-of-rights-day-and-human-rights-week-2008|work=[[Federal Register]]|publisher=[[Federal Government of the United States]]|location=[[Washington, D.C.]]|date=19 December 2008|accessdate=11 March 2017|archiveurl=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2008-12-12/pdf/E8-29704.pdf|archivedate=19 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ignacio Martín-Baró, S.J.''' (November 7, 1942 in [[Valladolid]], [[Castilla y Leon]], [[Spain]] &amp;ndash; November 16, 1989 in [[San Salvador]], [[El Salvador]]) was a [[scholar]], [[Social psychology|social psychologist]], [[philosopher]] and [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[priest]]. He was one of the victims of the [[1989 murders of Jesuits in El Salvador]]

== Academic career ==
Martín-Baró entered the [[novitiate]] of the Society of Jesus in [[Orduña]], [[Spain]], on September 28, 1959. Shortly after, he was transferred to the novitiate of [[Villagarcía]] and then sent to [[Central America]], where he completed his second year in the novitiate of the Society of Jesus.

At the end of September 1961, he began his studies in classical [[humanities]] at the [[Catholic University (Quito)|Catholic University]] in [[Quito]]. On graduating, he travelled to [[Bogotá]], where he studied philosophy at the [[Pontificia Universidad Javeriana]], run by the Jesuits. In 1964 he received his [[bachelor's degree]] in [[philosophy]] and in 1965 his [[Licentiate (degree)|licentiate]] (licenciatura) in philosophy and [[literature]]. In 1966 he returned to El Salvador, where he got a job as a teacher and academic coordinator at the [[Externado San José]]. In 1967, he started teaching at the [[Universidad Centroamericana "José Simeón Cañas"]] (UCA).

He travelled to [[Frankfurt]] in 1967 to study [[theology]]. Returning to San Salvador to continue his studies, he obtained his bachelor's degree from [[Eegenhoven]], [[Belgium]], in 1970. He then began studying [[psychology]] at UCA, where he was also lecturer. In 1975 he completed his licentiate in psychology.

In 1971 and 1972 he taught psychology in the [[National Nursing Academy]] in [[Santa Ana, El Salvador|Santa Ana]]. Later he was dean of Students between 1972 and 1975, and a member of the University Board, at UCA. From 1971 until 1974 he was head of the [[editorial board]] of the [[academic journal]] ''[[Estudios Centroamericanos]]'' (''ECA'').

In 1977 he earned a [[master's degree]] in [[social sciences]] from the [[University of Chicago]] and two years later, in 1979, a [[Ph.D.]] in social and [[Industrial and organizational psychology|organisational psychology]] from the same institution. In his master's [[thesis]], he discussed social [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] and [[group conflict]] in El Salvador, a theme which he continued in his doctoral dissertation which focused on [[population density]] of the lowest [[social class]]es in El Salvador.

On completing his studies he returned to San Salvador, where he lectured in psychology at UCA. By 1981 he was Academic Vice-[[Rector (academia)|Rector]] and member of the Board of Directors. In 1982 he became head of the psychology department. In 1986 he founded and directed the [[University Institute of Public Opinion, IUDOP]]. In 1989, the academic vice-rector's office was split in two and Martín-Baró became director of [[Postgraduate education|post-graduate]] studies and [[research]].

He was a member of the editorial board of [[UCA Editores]] and ''Estudios Centroamericanos'' (''ECA''), the [[Salvadoran Journal of Psychology]] and the [[Costa Rica]]n magazine ''[[Polémica]]''. He was a visiting [[professor]] at the [[Central University of Venezuela]], the [[Universidad del Zulia]] in [[Maracaibo]], the [[University of Puerto Rico]], [[Pontificia Universidad Javeriana]] in [[Bogotá]], [[Universidad Complutense]] in [[Madrid]] and [[Universidad de Costa Rica]] in [[San José, Costa Rica|San José]]. He was a member of the [[American Psychological Association]] as well as the [[Salvadoran Psychological Association]]. He was the vice-president of the [[Mesoamerican]] division of the [[Interamerican Psychological Society]].

Martín-Baró published eleven books and a long list of [[Culture|cultural]] and [[Science|scientific]] articles, in various [[Latin America]]n and [[North America]]n academic journals and magazines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=P. Ignacio Martín Baró (1942 - 1989) |url=http://www.uca.edu.sv/martires/nachob.html |publisher=[[Universidad Centroamericana "José Simeón Cañas"]] |date=November 16, 1992 |accessdate=April 25, 2011 |language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ignacio Martín-Baró's Social Psychology==
Martín Baró argued that psychology should be developed to address the historical context, the social conditions and aspirations of the people. He believed that students of psychology should learn to analyse human [[behaviour]] in the location of their practice, bearing in mind the criteria outlined for that location.

In his writings and [[lecture]]s he rejected the idea of universal, impartial psychology, and developed a psychology that was critically committed with the projects for alternative societies that existed in Latin America. For him, the [[psychical]] situation of individuals could either be an abnormal reaction to normal circumstances, or a normal reaction to abnormal conditions.

For Martín-Baró, the solution to [[mental health]] problems in societies characterised by [[oppression]], where "[[normal abnormality]]" prevails, is the transformation of society to transcend the [[historical reality]] of oppression. Psychologists cannot ignore the influence that difficult contexts have on mental health. Furthermore, if they do, then they become accomplices to the social injustices (or abnormalities) that may have caused these mental health problems.

He integrated diverse [[Theory|theories]], and was so convinced of the benefits to be gained by the "[[de-ideologise|de-ideologising]]" potential of social psychology that he openly questioned the theoretical [[Model (abstract)|models]] of [[mainstream]] psychology. He considered these models inadequate to address the effects of the structural [[violence]] that prevailed in El Salvador.

==Continuing impact==
His work inspired the development of [[liberation psychology]] in Latin America and influenced [[community psychology]] throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Writings for a Liberation Psychology |url=http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674962477 |author=Ignacio Martín-Baró |editor=Adrianne Aron |editor2=Shawn Corne |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |year=1996 |isbn=9780674962477 |accessdate=April 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through grant-making and education, the ''Martín-Baró Fund for Mental Health and Human Rights'' fosters psychological well-being, social consciousness, active resistance, and progressive social change in communities affected by institutional violence, repression and social injustice. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=the Martín-Baró Fund for Mental Health and Human Rights|url=http://martinbarofund.org|accessdate=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotes by Martín-Baró==
Explaining why reparations are a crucial part of the national reconciliation processes:

"It is clear that no one is going to return to the imprisoned dissident his youth; to the young woman who has been raped her innocence; to the person who has been tortured his or her integrity. Nobody is going to return the dead and the disappeared to their families. What can and must be publicly restored [are] the victims' names and their dignity, through a formal recognition of the injustice of what has occurred, and, wherever possible, material reparation.... Those who clamour for social reparation are not asking for vengeance. Nor are they blindly adding difficulties to a historical process that is already by no means easy. On the contrary, they are promoting the personal and social viability of a new society, truly democratic." &lt;ref&gt;Ignacio Martin-Baro, "Reparations: Attention Must be Paid", in ''Transitional Justice: How Emerging Democracies Reckon with Former Regimes'', ed. Neil Kritz (Washington, D.C.: United States Institute of Peace Press, 1995), 570. (original -posthumously; Ignacio Martin-Baro, "Reperations: Attention Must be Paid" ''Commonweal'', March 23, 1990, pp. 184-186).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotes on Martín-Baró==
"... a mind that was probing and humane, wide-ranging in interests and passionate in concerns, and dedicated with a rare combination of intelligence and heroism to the challenge his work sets forth to construct a new person in a new society." [[Noam Chomsky]], [[MIT]]

"... the major dimensions along which Martín-Baró's work developed: political psychology, war and trauma, and 'de-ideologizing' reality ... his contributions to social psychology as well as his intense involvement in the social reality of his adoptive country, El Salvador ... is required reading for psychologists seeking a more critical psychology—one that takes responsibility for its social position and privilege, and challenges the status quo. It is an equally important resource for those who seek ideas and examples for developing 'indigenous psychology' from the base of marginalized people's lives, in coalition with them." [[Brinton Lykes|M. Brinton Lykes]], ''World Psychology''

'''Incarnational humanism''' is a brand of [[humanism]] which affirms the value and essential goodness of human reason and [[human culture|culture]]. Developed in a [[Christian]] framework, incarnational humanism asserts a unification of the [[secular]] and the [[sacred]] with the goal of a common humanity. This unification is fully realized in the participatory nature of [[Christianity|Christian]] [[sacrament]]s, particularly the [[Eucharist]]. The recognition of this goal requires a necessary difference between the [[church (Christian)|church]] and the world, where both "spheres are unified in their service of humanity."

'''Jewish philosophy''' ({{Lang-he|פילוסופיה יהודית}}) includes all [[philosophy]] carried out by Jews, or in relation to the religion of [[Judaism]].  Until modern ''[[Haskalah]]'' (Jewish Enlightenment) and [[Jewish emancipation]], Jewish philosophy was preoccupied with attempts to reconcile coherent new ideas into the tradition of [[Rabbinic Judaism]], thus organizing emergent ideas that are not necessarily Jewish into a uniquely Jewish scholastic framework and world-view. With their acceptance into modern society, Jews with secular educations embraced or developed entirely new philosophies to meet the demands of the world in which they now found themselves.

Medieval re-discovery of [[ancient Greek philosophy]] among the [[Geonim]] of 10th century Babylonian academies brought rationalist philosophy into [[Tanakh|Biblical]]-[[Talmud]]ic Judaism. The philosophy was generally in competition with [[Kabbalah]]. Both schools would become part of classic [[Rabbinic literature]], though the decline of scholastic [[rationalism]] coincided with historical events which drew Jews to the Kabbalistic approach. For [[Ashkenazi Jews]], emancipation and encounter with secular thought from the 18th century onwards altered how philosophy was viewed. [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] and [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]] communities had later more ambivalent interaction with secular culture than in Western Europe. In the varied responses to modernity, Jewish philosophical ideas were developed across the range of emerging [[Jewish religious movements|religious movements]]. These developments could be seen as either continuations of or breaks from the canon of [[Rabbinic]] philosophy of the Middle Ages, as well as the other historical [[dialectic]] aspects of Jewish thought, and resulted in diverse contemporary Jewish attitudes to philosophical methods.

== Ancient Jewish philosophy ==

=== Philosophy in the Bible ===
[[Rabbinic literature]] sometimes views Abraham as a [[philosopher]]. Some have suggested that [[Abraham]] introduced a philosophy learned from [[Melchizedek]];&lt;ref&gt;"The Melchizedek Tradition: A Critical Examination of the Sources to the Fifth Century ad and in the Epistle to the Hebrews", by Fred L. Horton, Jr., Pg. 54, Cambridge University Press, 2005, {{ISBN|0-521-01871-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Jews ascribe the ''[[Sefer Yetzirah]]'' "Book of Creation" to Abraham.&lt;ref&gt;"Sefer Yetzirah", By Aryeh Kaplan, xii, Red Wheel, 1997, {{ISBN|0-87728-855-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[midrash]]&lt;ref&gt;Bereishit Rabba (39,1)&lt;/ref&gt; describes how Abraham understood this world to have a creator and director by comparing this world to "a house with a light in it", what is now called the [[Teleological argument|argument from design]].  [[Psalms]] contains invitations to admire the wisdom of God through his works; from this, some scholars suggest, Judaism harbors a Philosophical under-current.&lt;ref&gt;"Medieval Philosophy and the Classical Tradition: In Islam, Judaism and Christianity" by John Inglis, Page 3&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ecclesiastes]] is often considered to be the only genuine philosophical work in the [[Hebrew Bible]]; its author seeks to understand the place of human beings in the world and life's meaning.&lt;ref&gt;"Introduction to Philosophy" by Dr Tom Kerns&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Philo of Alexandria ===
[[File:PhiloThevet.jpg|thumb|100px|left|[[Philo]]]]
[[Philo]] attempted to fuse and harmonize Greek and Jewish philosophy through allegory, which he learned from Jewish exegesis and [[Stoicism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=281&amp;letter=P |title=Philo Judæus |publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philo attempted to make his philosophy the means of defending and justifying Jewish religious ''truths''. These ''truths'' he regarded as fixed and determinate, and philosophy was used as an aid to ''truth'', and a means of arriving at it. To this end Philo chose from philosophical tenets of Greeks, refusing those that did not harmonize with Judaism such as Aristotle's doctrine of the ''eternity and indestructibility of the world''.

Dr. [[Bernard Revel]], in dissertation on Karaite [[halakha]], points to writings of a 10th-century [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite]], [[Jacob Qirqisani]], who quotes Philo, illustrating how Karaites made use of Philo's works in development of Karaite Judaism. Philo's works became important to Medieval Christian scholars who leveraged the work of Karaites to lend credence to their claims that "these are the beliefs of Jews" - a technically correct, yet deceptive, attribution.

== Jewish scholarship after destruction of Second Temple ==
With the Roman destruction of the [[Second Temple]] in 70 CE, [[Second Temple Judaism]] was in disarray,&lt;ref&gt;"Christianity, Judaism and other Greco-Roman cults: studies for Morton Smith at sixty", Volume 12, Part 1, Pg 110, Volume 12 of Studies in Judaism in late antiquity, by Jacob Neusner ann  Morton Smith, Brill 1975, {{ISBN|90-04-04215-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Jewish traditions were preserved especially thanks to the shrewd maneuvers of [[Johanan ben Zakai]], who saved the [[Sanhedrin]] and moved it to [[Yavne]]. Philosophical speculation was not a central part of [[Rabbinic Judaism]], although some have seen the [[Mishnah]] as a philosophical work.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Neusner, ''Judaism as Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rabbi Akiva]] has also been viewed as a philosophical figure:&lt;ref&gt;"Beginnings in Jewish Philosophy", By Meyer Levin, Pg 49, Behrman House 1971, {{ISBN|0-87441-063-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; his statements include 1.) ''"How favored is man, for he was created after an image "for in an image, Elokim made man" ''(Gen. ix. 6)''"'', 2.) ''"Everything is foreseen; but freedom ''[of will]'' is given to every man"'', 3.) ''"The world is governed by mercy... but the divine decision is made by the preponderance of the good or bad in one's actions"''.

After the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]], Rabbinic scholars gathered in [[Tiberias]] and [[Safed]] to re-assemble and re-assess Judaism, its laws, theology, liturgy, beliefs and leadership structure. In 219 CE, the [[Sura Academy]] (from which [[Jewish Kalam]] emerged many centuries later) was founded by [[Abba Arika]]. For the next five centuries, Talmudic academies focused upon reconstituting Judaism and little, if any, philosophic investigation was pursued.

=== Who influences whom? ===
{{further|Early Islamic philosophy}}
Rabbinic Judaism had limited philosophical activity until it was challenged by [[Islam]], Karaite Judaism, and [[Christianity]]—with Tanach, Mishnah, and Talmud, there was no need for a philosophic framework.  From an economic viewpoint, [[Radhanite]] trade dominance was being usurped by coordinated Christian and Islamic forced-conversions, and torture, compelling Jewish scholars to understand nascent economic threats.  These investigations triggered new ideas and intellectual exchange among Jewish and Islamic scholars in the areas of jurisprudence, mathematics, astronomy, logic and philosophy.  Jewish scholars influenced Islamic scholars and Islamic scholars influenced Jewish scholars.  Contemporary scholars continue to debate who was Muslim and who was Jew—some "Islamic scholars" were "Jewish scholars" prior to forced conversion to Islam, some Jewish scholars willingly converted to Islam, such as [[Abdullah ibn Salam]], while others later reverted to Judaism, and still others, born and raised as Jews, were ambiguous in their religious beliefs such as [[ibn al-Rawandi]], although they lived according to the customs of their neighbors.

Around 700 CE, ʿAmr ibn ʿUbayd Abu ʿUthman al-Basri introduces two streams of thought that influence Jewish, Islamic and Christian scholars:
#[[Qadariyah]]
# [[Bahshamiyya]] [[Muʿtazila]]

The story of the Bahshamiyya Muʿtazila and Qadariyah is as important, if not more so, as the intellectual symbiosis of Judaism and Islam in Islamic Spain.

Around 733 CE, [[Mar]] Natronai ben Habibai moves to [[Kairouan]], then to Spain, transcribing the [[Talmud]] ''Bavli'' for the Academy at Kairouan from memory—later taking a copy with him to Spain.&lt;ref&gt;"Geonica", By Ginzberg Louis, Pg. 18, {{ISBN|1-110-35511-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Karaism ====
{{main|Karaite Judaism}}
Borrowing from the [[Judeo-Islamic philosophies (800–1400)|Mutakallamin]] of [[Basra]], the Karaites were the first Jewish group to subject Judaism to Muʿtazila. Rejecting the Talmud and Rabbinical tradition, Karaites took liberty to reinterpret the [[Tanakh]]. This meant abandoning foundational Jewish belief structures. Some scholars suggest that the major impetus for the formation of Karaism was a reaction to the rapid rise of Shi'i Islam, which recognized Judaism as a fellow monotheistic faith but claimed that it detracted from monotheism by deferring to Rabbinic authority. Karaites absorbed certain aspects of Jewish sects such as the followers of [[Abu Isa]] (Shi'ism), [[Maliki]] (Sunnis) and Yudghanites (Sufis), who were influenced by East-Islamic scholarship yet deferred to the [[Ash'ari]] when contemplating the sciences.

The spread of Islam throughout the Middle East and North Africa rendered Muslim all that was once Jewish.  Greek philosophy, science, medicine and mathematics was absorbed by Jewish scholars living in the Arab world due to Arabic translations of those texts; remnants of the [[Library of Alexandria]].  Early Jewish converts to Islam brought with them stories from their heritage, known as ''[[Isra'iliyyat]]'', which told of the ''Banu Isra'il'', the pious men of ancient Israel.  One of the most famous early mystics of [[Sufism]], [[Hasan of Basra]], introduced numerous ''Isra'iliyyat'' legends into Islamic scholarship, stories that went on to become representative of Islamic mystical ideas of piety of Sufism.

[[Hai Gaon]] of [[Pumbedita Academy]] begins a new phase in Jewish scholarship and investigation (''hakirah''); Hai Gaon augments Talmudic scholarship with non-Jewish studies.  Hai Gaon was a savant with an exact knowledge of the theological movements of his time so much so that [[Moses ibn Ezra]] called him a [[kalam|mutakallim]].  Hai was competent to argue with followers of Qadariyyah and Mutazilites, sometimes adopting their polemic methods.  Through correspondence with Talmudic Academies at Kairouan, Cordoba and Lucena, Hai Gaon passes along his discoveries to Talmudic scholars therein.

The teachings of the [[Brethren of Purity]] were carried to the West by a Spanish Arab of Madrid, Muhammad Abu'l-Qasim al-Majnti al-Andalusi, who died in AD 1004–1005. Thanks to [[Averroes]], Spain became a center of philosophical learning as is reflected by the explosion of philosophical inquiry among Jews, Muslims and Christians.&lt;ref&gt;"A literary History of Persia" Book IV, Chapter X.

== Jewish philosophy before Maimonides ==

=== "Hiwi the Heretic" ===
According to Sa'adya Gaon, the Jewish community of [[Balkh]] (Afghanistan) was divided into two groups: "Jews" and "people that are called Jews"; [[Hiwi al-Balkhi]] was a member of the latter.  Hiwi is generally considered to be the very first "Jewish" philosopher to subject the Pentateuch to critical analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Fleischer, Ezra.

Merhaviah: Sifriyyat Po'alim, 1965&lt;/ref&gt;  As examples of this position, he argued that the parting of the Red Sea was a natural phenomenon, and that Moses' claim to greatness lay merely in his ability to calculate the right moment for the crossing.  He also emphasized that the Egyptian magicians were able to reproduce several of Moses' "miracles," proving that they could not have been so unique.  According to scholars, Hiwi's gravest mistake was having the Pentateuch redacted to reflect his own views - then had those redacted texts, which became popular,  distributed to children.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Israel, ed.

In this context, however, we can also regard Hiwi, while flawed, as the very first critical biblical commentator; zealous rationalistic views of Hiwi parallel those of [[Ibn al-Rawandi]].

Saʿadya Gaon dedicated an entire treatise, written in rhyming Hebrew, to a refutation of Ḥīwī's arguments, two fragments of which, preserved in the Cairo Geniza, have been published (Davidson, 1915; Schirmann, 1965).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Marzena Zawanowska|title=" Ḥīwī al-Balkhī."

=== Sa'adya Gaon ===
[[Saadia Gaon]], son of a [[proselyte]], is considered the greatest early Jewish philosopher. During his early years in [[Tulunids|Tulunid]] Egypt, the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] ruled Egypt; the leaders of the [[Tulunids]] were Ismaili Imams.  Their influence upon the Jewish academies of Egypt resonate in the works of Sa'adya.  Sa'adya's ''[[Emunoth ve-Deoth]]'' ("Beliefs and Opinions") was originally called ''Kitab al-Amanat wal-l'tikadat'' ("Book of the Articles of Faith and Doctrines of Dogma"); it was the first systematic presentation and philosophic foundation of the dogmas of Judaism, completed at Sura Academy in 933 CE.

Little known is that Saadia traveled to [[Tiberias]] in 915CE to study with Abū 'l-Kathīr Yaḥyā ibn Zakariyyāʾ al-Katib al-Tabari (Tiberias), a Jewish theologian and Bible translator from Tiberias whose main claim to fame is the fact that Saadia Gaon studied with him at some point. He is not mentioned in any Jewish source, and apart from the Andalusian heresiographer and polemicist [[Ibn Hazm]], who mentions him as a Jewish mutakallim (rational theologian), our main source of information is the ''Kitāb al-Tanbīh'' by the Muslim historian [[Al-Masudi|al-Masʿūdī]] (d. 956). In his brief survey of Arabic translations of the Bible, al-Masʿūdī states that the Israelites rely for exegesis and translation of the Hebrew books—i.e., the Torah, Prophets, and Psalms, twenty-four books in all, he says—on a number of Israelites whom they praise highly, almost all of whom he has met in person. He mentions Abū ʾl-Kathīr as one of them, and also Saadia ("Saʿīd ibn Yaʿqūb al-Fayyūmī").  Regardless of what we do not know, Saadia traveled to Tiberias (home of the learned scribes and exegetes) to learn and he chose Abū 'l-Kathīr Yaḥyā ibn Zakariyyāʾ al-Katib al-Tabariya. The extent of Abū ʾl-Kathīr's influence on Saadia's thought cannot be established, however.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Camilla Adang]]|title=" Abū 'l-Kathīr Yaḥyā ibn Zakariyyāʾ." Encyclopedia of Jews in the Islamic World. Executive Editor Norman A. Stillman|publisher=Brillonline.com|url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopedia-of-jews-in-the-islamic-world/abu-l-kathir-yahya-ibn-zakariyya-COM_0000600|accessdate=2012-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abū ʾl-Kathīr's profession is also unclear. al-Masʿūdī calls him a ''kātib'', which has been variously interpreted as secretary, government official, (biblical) scribe, Masorete, and book copyist. For lack of further information, some scholars have tried to identify Abū ʾl-Kathīr with the Hebrew grammarian Abū ʿAlī Judah ben ʿAllān, likewise of Tiberias, who seems to have been a Karaite Jew. However, al-Masūdī unequivocally describes Abu ʾl-Kathīr (as well as his student Saadia) as an ashmaʿthī (Rabbanite).

In "Book of the Articles of Faith and Doctrines of Dogma" Saadia declares the rationality of the Jewish religion with the caveat that reason must capitulate wherever it contradicts tradition. Dogma takes precedence over reason. Saadia closely followed the rules of the [[Kalam|Muʿtazila]] school of Abu Ali al-Jubba'i in composing his works.&lt;ref&gt;s.v. al-Djubba'i, {{Cite book | edition = New | publisher = E. J.

[[David ibn Merwan al-Mukkamas]] was author of the earliest known Jewish philosophical work of the [[Middle Ages]], a commentary on the ''[[Sefer Yetzirah]]''; he is regarded as the father of Jewish medieval philosophy. Sl-Mukkamas was first to introduce the ''methods'' of [[Kalam]] into Judaism and the first Jew to mention Aristotle in his writings.  He was a [[proselyte]] of [[Rabbinic Judaism]] (not [[Karaite Judaism]], as some argue); al-Mukkamas was a student of physician, and renowned Christian philosopher, Hana.  His close interaction with Hana, and his familial affiliation with Islam gave al-Mukkamas a unique view of religious belief and theology.

In 1898 [[Abraham Harkavy]] discovered, in Imperial Library of St. Petersburg, fifteen of the twenty chapters of David's philosophical work entitled ''Ishrun Maḳalat'' (Twenty Chapters) of which 15 survive.  One of the oldest surviving witnesses to early Kalām, it begins with epistemological investigations, turns to proofs of the creation of the world and the subsequent existence of a Creator, discusses the unity of the Creator (including the divine attributes), and concludes with theodicy (humanity and revelation) and a refutation of other religions (mostly lost).

In 915 CE, Sa'adya Gaon left for Palestine, where, according to al-Masʿūdī (Tanbīh, 113), he perfected his education at the feet of Abū 'l-Kathīr Yaḥyā ibn Zakariyyāʾ al-Katib al-Tabari (d. 320/932). The latter is also mentioned by Ibn Ḥazm in his K. al-Fiṣlal wa 'l-niḥal, iii, 171, as being, together with Dāwūd ibn Marwān al-Muqammiṣ and Sa'adya himself, one of the mutakallimūn of the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=" Saʿadyā Ben Yōsēf."

Since al-Muqammiṣ made few references to specifically Jewish issues and very little of his work was translated from Arabic into Hebrew, he was largely forgotten by  Jewish tradition. Nonetheless, he had a significant impact on subsequent Jewish philosophical followers of the Kalām, such as Saʿadya Gaon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Daniel J.

=== Samuel ibn Naghrillah ===
[[Samuel ibn Naghrillah]], born in [[Mérida, Spain]], lived in [[Córdoba, Andalusia|Córdoba]] and was a child prodigy and student of Hanoch ben Moshe. Samuel ibn Naghrillah, [[Hasdai ibn Shaprut]], and Moshe ben Hanoch founded the Lucena Yeshiva that produced such brilliant scholars as [[Isaac ibn Ghiyyat]] and Maimon ben Yosef, the father of [[Maimonides]]. Ibn Naghrillah's son, Yosef, provided refuge for two sons of [[Hezekiah Gaon]]; Daud Ibn Chizkiya Gaon Ha-Nasi and Yitzhak Ibn Chizkiya Gaon Ha-Nasi.  Though not a philosopher, he did build the infrastructure to allow philosophers to thrive.  In 1070 the gaon Isaac ben Moses ibn Sakri of Denia, Spain traveled to the East and acted as ''rosh yeshivah'' of the Baghdad Academy.

[[Solomon ibn Gabirol]] was born in [[Málaga]] then moved to [[Valencia]].  Ibn Gabirol was one of the first teachers of [[Neoplatonism]] in Europe. His role has been compared to that of Philo. Ibn Gabirol occidentalized Greco-Arabic philosophy and restored it to Europe.  The philosophical teachings of Philo and ibn Gabirol were largely ignored by fellow Jews; the parallel may be extended by adding that Philo and ibn Gabirol both exercised considerable influence in secular circles; Philo upon early Christianity and Ibn Gabirol upon the scholars of medieval Christianity. Christian scholars, including [[Albertus Magnus]] and  [[Thomas Aquinas]], defer to him frequently.

[[Abraham bar Hiyya]], of [[Barcelona]] and later [[Arles]]-[[Provence]], was a student of his father [[Hiyya al-Daudi]] and one of the most important figures in the scientific movement which made the Jews of Provence, Spain and Italy the intermediaries between [[Averroism]], Muʿtazila and Christian Europe. He aided this scientific movement by original works, translations and as interpreter for another translator, [[Plato Tiburtinus]]. Bar-Hiyya's best student was [[v]].  His philosophical works are "Meditation of the Soul", an ethical work written from a rationalistic religious viewpoint, and an apologetic epistle addressed to [[Judah ben Barzillai]].

=== Hibat Allah ===
Originally known by his Hebrew name Nethanel Baruch ben Melech al-Balad,&lt;ref&gt;"Jews in Islamic countries in the Middle Ages Volume 28 of Études sur le judaïsme médiéval" by Moshe Gil and David Strassler, {{ISBN|90-04-13882-X}}, 9789004138827&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abu'l-Barakāt al-Baghdādī]], known as ''Hibat Allah'', was a Jewish philosopher and physicist and father-in-law of Maimonides who converted to Islam in his twilight years - once head of the Baghdad Yeshiva and considered the leading philosopher of Iraq.

Historians differ over the motive for his conversion to Islam. Some suggest it was a reaction to a social slight inflicted upon him because he was a Jew, while others suggest he was forcibly converted at the edge of a sword (which prompted Maimonides to comment upon [[Anusim]]). Despite his conversion to Islam, his works continued to be studied at the Jewish Baghdad Academy, a well-known academy, into the thirteenth century. He was a follower of Avicenna's teaching, who proposed an explanation of the acceleration of falling bodies by the accumulation of successive increments of power with successive increments of velocity.

His writings include ''Kitāb al-Muʿtabar'' ("The Book of What Has Been Established by Personal Reflection"); a philosophical commentary on the Kohelet, written in Arabic using Hebrew aleph bet; and the treatise "On the Reason Why the Stars Are Visible at Night and Hidden in Daytime." According to Hibat Allah, ''Kitāb al-Muʿtabar'' consists in the main of critical remarks jotted down by him over the years while reading philosophical text, and published at the insistence of his friends, in the form of a philosophical work.

[[Natan'el al-Fayyumi]]&lt;ref&gt;A history of Jewish philosophy in the Middle Ages By Colette Sirat&lt;/ref&gt; of Yemen, was the twelfth-century author of ''Bustan al-Uqul'' ("Garden of Intellects"), a Jewish version of [[Isma'ilism|Ismaili]] [[Shia Islam|Shi'i]] doctrines. Like the Ismailis, Natan'el al-Fayyumi argued that God sent different prophets to various nations of the world, containing legislations suited to the particular temperament of each individual nation.  Ismaili doctrine holds that a single universal religious truth lies at the root of the different religions. Some Jews accepted this model of religious pluralism, leading them to view [[Muhammad]] as a legitimate prophet, though not Jewish, sent to preach to the [[Arabs]], just as the Hebrew prophets had been sent to deliver their messages to Israel; others refused this notion in entirety. Natan'el's son Yaqub turned to Maimonides, asking urgently for counsel on how to deal with forced conversions to Islam and religious persecutions at the hand of [[Saladin]].  Maimonides' response was the ''[[Epistle to Yemen]]''.

[[Bahya ibn Paquda|Bahye ben Yosef Ibn Paquda]], of Zaragoza, was author of the first Jewish system of ethics ''Al Hidayah ila Faraid al-hulub'', ("Guide to the Duties of the Heart").  Bahya often followed the method of the Arabian encyclopedists known as "the [[Brethren of Purity]]" but adopts some of Sufi tenets rather than Ismaili.  According to Bahya, the Torah appeals to reason and knowledge as proofs of God's existence.  It is therefore a duty incumbent upon every one to make God an object of speculative reason and knowledge, in order to arrive at true faith.  Baḥya borrows from [[Sufism]] and [[Jewish Kalam]] integrating them into Neoplatonism.  Proof that Bahya borrowed from Sufism is underscored by the fact that the title of his eighth gate, ''Muḥasabat al-Nafs'' ("Self-Examination"), is reminiscent of the Sufi  ''Abu Abd Allah Ḥarith Ibn-Asad'', who has been surnamed ''El Muḥasib'' ("the self-examiner"), because—say his biographers—"he was always immersed in introspection"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=134&amp;letter=B&amp;search=Bahya#ixzz0Tx3CqjNq |title=Bahya Ben Joseph Ibn Paḳuda |publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibn Daud's philosophical work written in Arabic, ''Al-'akidah al-Rafiyah'' ("The Sublime Faith"), has been preserved in Hebrew by the title ''Emunah Ramah''.  Ibn Daud did not introduce a new philosophy, but he was the first to introduce a more thorough systematic form derived from [[Aristotle]].  Accordingly, [[Hasdai Crescas]] mentions Ibn Daud as the only Jewish philosopher among the predecessors of Maimonides.&lt;ref&gt;''Or Adonai'', ch. i.&lt;/ref&gt;  Overshadowed by Maimonides, ibn Daud's ''Emunah Ramah'', a work to which Maimonides was indebted, received little notice from later philosophers.  "True philosophy", according to Ibn Daud, "does not entice us from religion; it tends rather to strengthen and solidify it. Moreover, it is the duty of every thinking Jew to become acquainted with the harmony existing between the fundamental doctrines of Judaism and those of philosophy, and, wherever they seem to contradict one another, to seek a mode of reconciling them".

{{main|Maimonides}}
[[Maimonides#Philosophy|Maimonides]] wrote ''[[The Guide for the Perplexed]]'' — his most influential philosophic work.  He was a student of his father, Rabbi Maimon ben Yosef (a student of [[Joseph ibn Migash]]) in Cordoba, Spain.  When his family fled Spain, for Fez, Maimonides enrolled in the Academy of Fez and studied under Rabbi Yehuda Ha-Kohen Ibn Soussan — a student of [[Isaac Alfasi]].  Maimonides strove to reconcile Aristotelian philosophy and science with the teachings of Torah.  In some ways his position was parallel to that of [[Averroes]]; in reaction to the attacks on Avicennian Aristotelism, Maimonides embraced and defended a stricter Aristotelism without Neoplatonic additions.  The principles which inspired all of Maimonides' philosophical activity was identical those of [[Abraham Ibn Daud]]: there can be no contradiction between the truths which God has revealed and the findings of the human intellect in science and philosophy. Maimonides departed from the teachings of Aristotle by suggesting that the world is not eternal, as Aristotle taught, but was created ''[[ex nihilo]]''.  In "Guide for the Perplexed" (1:17 &amp; 2:11)" Maimonides explains that Israel lost its [[Tradition|Mesorah]] in exile, and with it "we lost our science and philosophy — only to be rejuvenated in Al Andalus within the context of interaction and intellectual investigation of Jewish, Christian and Muslim texts.

== Medieval Jewish philosophy after Maimonides ==
Maimonides writings almost immediately came under attack from Karaites, Dominican Christians, Tosafists of Provence, [[Ashkenaz]] and [[Al Andalus]].  His genius was obvious, protests centered around his writings.  Scholars suggest that [[Maimonides]] instigated the [[Maimonidean Controversy]] when he verbally attacked ''Samuel ben Ali Ha-Levi al-Dastur'' ("Gaon of Baghdad") as "one whom people accustom from his youth to believe that there is none like him in his generation," and he sharply attack the "monetary demands" of the academies.  ''al-Dastur''was an anti-Maimonidean operating in Babylon to undermine the works of [[Maimonides]] and those of Maimonides' patrons (the Al-Constantini Family from North Africa).  To illustrate the reach of the Maimonidean Controversy, ''al-Dastur'', the chief opponent of Maimonides in the East, was excommunicated by ''Daud Ibn Hodaya al Daudi'' (Exilarch of Mosul).  Maimonides' attacks on Ibn al-Dastur may not have been entirely altruistic given the position of Maimonides' in-laws in competing Yeshivas.

In Western Europe, the controversy was halted by the burning of Maimonides' works by Christian Dominicans, in 1232. [[Avraham son of Rambam]], continued fighting for his father's beliefs in the East; desecration of Maimonides' tomb, at [[Tiberias]] by Jews, was a profound shock to Jews throughout the Diaspora and caused all to pause and reflect upon what was being done to the fabric of Jewish Culture.  This compelled many Anti-Maimonideans to recant their assertions and realize what cooperation with Christians meant to them, their texts and their communities.

Maimonidean controversy flared up again&lt;ref&gt;Stroumsa, S. (1993) 'On the Maimonidean Controversy in the East: the Role of Abu 'l-Barakat al-Baghdadi', in H. Ben-Shammai (ed.) Hebrew and Arabic Studies in Honour of Joshua Blau, Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. (On the role of Abu 'l-Barakat's writings in the resurrection controversy of the twelfth century; in Hebrew.)&lt;/ref&gt; at the beginning of the fourteenth century when Rabbi [[Shlomo ben Aderet]], under influence from [[Asher ben Jehiel]], issued a [[Herem (censure)|cherem]] on ''"any member of the community who, being under twenty-five years, shall study the works of the Greeks on natural science and metaphysics."''

Contemporary Kabbalists, Tosafists and Rationalists continue to engage in lively, sometimes caustic, debate in support of their positions and influence in the Jewish world.  At the center of many of these debates are 1) "Guide for the Perplexed", 2) "13 Principles of Faith", 3) "Mishnah Torah", and 4) his commentary on [[Anusim]].

Yosef traveled from [[Alexandria]] to [[Fustat]] to study logic, mathematics, and astronomy under Maimonides.  Philosophically, Yosef's dissertation, in Arabic, on the problem of "Creation" is suspected to have been written before contact with Maimonides. It is entitled ''Ma'amar bimehuyav ha-metsiut ve'eykhut sidur ha-devarim mimenu vehidush ha'olam'' ("A Treatise as to (1) Necessary Existence (2) The Procedure of Things from the Necessary Existence and (3) The Creation of the World").

=== Jacob Anatoli ===
[[Jacob Anatoli|Jacob ben Abba Mari ben Simson Anatoli]] is generally regarded as a pioneer in the application of the Maimonidean Rationalism to the study of Jewish texts.   He was the son-in-law of [[Samuel ibn Tibbon]], translator of Maimonides.  Due to these family ties Anatoli was introduced to the philosophy of Maimonides, the study of which was such a great revelation to him that he, in later days, referred to it as the beginning of his intelligent and true comprehension of the Scriptures, while he frequently alluded to Ibn Tibbon as one of the two masters who had instructed and inspired him.  Anatoli wrote the ''Malmad'' exhibiting his broad knowledge of classic Jewish exegetes, as well as Plato, Aristotle, Averroes, and the Vulgate, as well as with a large number of Christian institutions, some of which he ventures to criticize, such as celibacy and monastic castigation, as well as certain heretics and he repeatedly appeals to his readers for a broader cultivation of the classic languages and the non-Jewish branches of learning.  To Anatoli all men are, in truth, formed in the image of God, though the Jews stand under a particular obligation to further the true cognition of God simply by reason of their election—"the Greeks had chosen wisdom as their pursuit; the Romans, power; and the Jews, religiousness"

=== Hillel ben Samuel ===
Firstly, [[Hillel ben Samuel]]'s importance in the history of medieval Jewish philosophy lies in his attempt to deal, systematically, with the question of the immortality of the soul.  Secondly, Hillel played a major role in the controversies of 1289–90 concerning the philosophical works of Maimonides.  Thirdly, Hillel was the first devotee of Jewish learning and Philosophy in Italy, bringing a close to a period of relative ignorance of Hakira in Verona (Italy).  And finally, Hillel is one of the early Latin translators of "the wise men of the nations" (non-Jewish scholars).

Defending Maimonides, Hillel addressed a letter to his friend Maestro Gaio asking him to use his influence with the Jews of Rome against Maimonides' opponents (Solomon Petit).  He also advanced the bold idea of gathering together Maimonides' defenders and opponents in Alexandria, in order to bring the controversy before a court of Babylonian rabbis, whose decision would be binding on both factions.  Hillel was certain the verdict would favor Maimonides.

Hillel wrote a commentary on the 25 propositions appearing at the beginning of the second part of the Guide of the Perplexed, and three philosophical treatises, which were appended to Tagmulei ha-Nefesh: the first on knowledge and free will; the second on the question of why mortality resulted from the sin of Adam; the third on whether or not the belief in the fallen angels is a true belief.

[[Shem-Tov ibn Falaquera]] was a Spanish-born philosopher who pursued reconciliation between Jewish dogma and philosophy.  Scholars speculate he was a student of Rabbi [[David Kimhi]] whose family fled Spain to Narbonne.&lt;ref&gt;The encyclopædia britannica: a dictionary of arts, sciences ..., Volume 13 edited by Hugh Chisholm, Pg 174&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Falaquera lived an ascetic live of solitude.&lt;ref&gt;A short biographical article about Rabeinu Shem Tov Ben Yosef Falaquera, one of the great Rishonim who was a defender of the Rambam, and the author of the Moreh HaMoreh on the Rambam's Moreh Nevuchim. Published in the Jewish Quarterly Review journal (Vol .1 1910/1911).&lt;/ref&gt;  Ibn Falaquera's two leading philosophic authorities were Averroes and Maimonides.  Ibn Falaquera defended the ''"Guide for the Perplexed"'' against attacks of anti-Maimonideans.&lt;ref&gt;Torah and Sophia: The Life and Thought of Shem Tov Ibn Falaquera (Monographs of the Hebrew Union College) by Raphael Jospe&lt;/ref&gt;  He knew the works of the Islamic philosophers better than any Jewish scholar of his time, and made many of them available to other Jewish scholars – often without attribution (''Reshit Hokhmah'').  Ibn Falaquera did not hesitate to modify Islamic philosophic texts when it suited his purposes. For example, Ibn Falaquera turned Alfarabi's account of the origin of philosophic religion into a discussion of the origin of the "virtuous city".  Ibn Falaquera's other works include, but are not limited to Iggeret Hanhagat ha-Guf we ha-Nefesh, a treatise in verse on the control of the body and the soul.

* ''Iggeret ha-Wikkuaḥ'', a dialogue between a religious Jew and a Jewish philosopher on the harmony of philosophy and religion.
* ''Reshit Ḥokmah'', treating of moral duties, of the sciences, and of the necessity of studying philosophy.
* ''Sefer ha-Ma'alot'', on different degrees of human perfection.
* ''Moreh ha-Moreh'', commentary on the philosophical part of Maimonides' "Guide for the Perplexed".

=== Joseph ben Abba Mari ibn Kaspi ===
[[Joseph Caspi|Ibn Kaspi]] was a fierce advocate of Maimonides to such an extent that he left for Egypt in 1314 in order to hear explanations on the latter's Guide of the Perplexed from Maimonides' grandchildren.  When he heard that the Guide of the Perplexed was being studied in the Muslim philosophical schools of Fez, he left for that town (in 1332) in order to observe their method of study.

Ibn Kaspi began writing when he was 17 years old on topics which included logic, linguistics, ethics, theology, biblical exegesis, and super-commentaries to Abraham Ibn Ezra and Maimonides.  Philosophic system he followed Aristotle and Averroes.  He defines his aim as "not to be a fool who believes in everything, but only in that which can be verified by proof...and not to be of the second unthinking category which disbelieves from the start of its inquiry," since "certain things must be accepted by tradition, because they cannot be proven."  Scholars continue to debate whether ibn Kaspi was a heretic or one of Judaisms most illustrious scholars.

Rabbi [[Gersonides|Levi ben Gershon]] was a student of his father [[Gerson ben Solomon of Arles]], who in turn was a student of [[Shem-Tov ibn Falaquera]].  Gersonides is best known for his work ''Milhamot HaShem'' ("Wars of the Lord").  ''Milhamot HaShem'' is modelled after the "[[Guide for the Perplexed]]".  Gersonides and his father were avid students of the works of [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]], Aristotle, [[Empedocles]], [[Galen]], [[Hippocrates]], [[Homer]], Plato, [[Ptolemy]], [[Pythagoras]], [[Themistius]], [[Theophrastus]], [[Ali ibn Abbas al-Magusi]], [[Ali ibn Ridwan]], Averroes, [[Avicenna]], [[Qusta ibn Luqa]], [[Al-Farabi]], Al-Fergani, Chonain, Isaac Israeli, [[Ibn Tufail]], [[Ibn Zuhr]], Isaac Alfasi, and Maimonides.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Gersonides held that God does not have complete foreknowledge of human acts.  "Gersonides, bothered by the old question of how God's foreknowledge is compatible with [[human freedom]], suggests that what God knows beforehand is all the choices open to each individual. God does not know, however, which choice the individual, in his freedom, will make."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Jacobs |first=Louis |year=1990 |title= God, Torah, Israel: traditionalism without fundamentalism |location=Cincinnati |publisher=Hebrew Union College Press |isbn= 0-87820-052-5 |oclc= 21039224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His best-known work is his ''Shelemut ha-Nefesh'' ("Treatise on the Perfection of the Soul").  Moses began studying philosophy with his father when he was thirteen later studying with Moses ben David Caslari and [[Abraham ben David Caslari]] - both of whom were students of [[Kalonymus ben Kalonymus]].  Moses believed that Judaism was a guide to the highest degree of theoretical and moral truth. He believed that the Torah had both a simple, direct meaning accessible to the average reader as well as a deeper, metaphysical meaning accessible to thinkers. Moses rejected the belief in miracles, instead believing they could be explained, and defended man's free will by philosophical arguments.

[[Isaac ben Sheshet]] Perfet, of Barcelona, studied under [[Hasdai Crescas]] and Rabbi [[Nissim ben Reuben]] Gerondi.  [[Nissim ben Reuben]] Gerondi, was a steadfast Rationalist who did not hesitate to refute leading authorities, such as [[Rashi]], [[Rabbeinu Tam]], [[Moses ben Nahman]], and [[Solomon ben Adret]].  The pogroms of 1391, against Jews of Spain, forced Isaac to flee to Algiers - where he lived out his life.   Isaac's responsa evidence a profound knowledge of the philosophical writings of his time; in one of Responsa No. 118 he explains the difference between the opinion of ''Gersonides'' and that of ''Abraham ben David of Posquières'' on free will, and gives his own views on the subject. He was an adversary of Kabbalah who never spoke of the Sefirot; he quotes another philosopher when reproaching kabbalists with "''believing in the "Ten" (Sefirot) as the Christians believe in the Trinity''".&lt;ref&gt;Responsa No. 159&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hasdai Crescas]], of Barcelona, was a leading rationalist on issues of natural law and free-will. His views  can be seen as precursors to [[Baruch Spinoza]].  His work, ''[[Or Adonai]]'', became a classic refutation of medieval Aristotelism, and harbinger of the scientific revolution in the 16th century.  Hasdai Crescas was a student of [[Nissim ben Reuben]] Gerondi, who in turn was a student of Reuben ben Nissim Gerondi.  Crescas was not a Rabbi, yet he was active as a teacher.  Among his fellow students and friends, his best friend was [[Isaac ben Sheshet]] Perfet.  Cresca's students won accolades as participants in the [[Disputation of Tortosa]].

=== Simeon ben Zemah Duran ===
Influenced by the teaching of Rabbi [[Nissim of Gerona]], via Ephraim Vidal's Yeshiva in Majorca, Duran's commentary ''Magen Avot'' ("The Shield of the Fathers"), which influenced [[Joseph Albo]], is important.  He was also a student of philosophy, astronomy, mathematics, and especially of medicine, which he practiced for a number of years at Palma, in Majorca.  ''Magen Avot'' deals with concepts such as the nature of God, the eternity of the Torah, the coming of the Messiah, and the Resurrection of the dead.  Duran believed that Judaism has three dogmas only: the existence of God, the Torah's Divine origin, and Reward and Punishment; in this regard he was followed by Joseph Albo.

}}[[Joseph Albo]], of Monreal, was a student of [[Hasdai Crescas]].  He wrote ''Sefer ha-Ikkarim'' ("Book of Principles"), a classic work on the fundamentals of Judaism.  Albo narrows the fundamental Jewish principles of faith from thirteen to three -
::::::* belief in the existence of God,
::::::* belief in revelation, and
::::::* belief in divine justice, as related to the idea of immortality.
Albo rejects the assumption that [[creation ex nihilo]] is essential in belief in God.  Albo freely criticizes Maimonides' thirteen principles of belief and Crescas' six principles.  According to Albo, "belief in the Messiah is only a 'twig' unnecessary to the soundness of the trunk"; not essential to Judaism.  Nor is it true, according to Albo, that every law is binding.  Though every ordinance has the power of conferring happiness in its observance, it is not true that every law must be observed, or that through the neglect of a part of the law, a Jew would violate the divine covenant or be damned.  Contemporary Orthodox Jews, however, vehemently disagree with Albo's position believing that all Jews are divinely obligated to fulfill every applicable commandment.

[[Hoter ben Shlomo]] was a scholar and philosopher in Yemen heavily influenced by Nethanel ben al-Fayyumi, Maimonides, Saadia Gaon and al-Ghazali.  The connection between the "Epistle of the [[Brethren of Purity]]" and Ismailism suggests the adoption of this work as one of the main sources of what would become known as "Jewish Ismailism" as found in Late Medieval Yemenite Judaism.  "Jewish Ismailism" consisted of adapting, to Judaism, a few Ismaili doctrines about cosmology, prophecy, and hermeneutics.  There are many examples of the [[Brethren of Purity]] influencing [[Yemenite Jew]]ish philosophers and authors in the period 1150–1550.&lt;ref&gt;D. Blumenthal, "An  Illustration of the Concept 'Philosophic Mysticism' from Fifteenth Century Yemen," and "A Philosophical-Mystical Interpretation of a Shi'ur Qomah Text."&lt;/ref&gt;  Some traces of Brethren of Purity doctrines, as well as of their [[numerology]], are found in two Yemenite philosophical [[midrashim]] written in 1420–1430: ''Midrash ha-hefez'' ("The Glad Learning") by Zerahyah ha-Rofé (a/k/a Yahya al-Tabib) and the ''Siraj al-'uqul'' ("Lamp of Intellects") by Hoter ben Solomon.

[[Isaac Abravanel]], statesman, philosopher, Bible commentator, and financier who commented on Maimonides' thirteen principles in his ''Rosh Amanah''.  [[Isaac Abravanel]] was steeped in Rationalism by the Ibn Yahya family, who had a residence immediately adjacent to the ''Great Synagogue of Lisbon'' (also built by the Ibn Yahya Family). His most important work, ''Rosh Amanah'' ("The Pinnacle of Faith"), defends Maimonides' thirteen articles of belief against attacks of Hasdai Crescas and Yosef Albo.  ''Rosh Amanah'' ends with the statement that "Maimonides compiled these articles merely in accordance with the fashion of other nations, which set up axioms or fundamental principles for their science".

[[Isaac Abravanel]] was born and raised in Lisbon; a student of the Rabbi of Lisbon, ''Yosef ben Shlomo Ibn Yahya''.&lt;ref&gt;"Isaac Abarbanel's stance toward tradition: defense, dissent, and dialogue" By Eric Lawee&lt;/ref&gt;  Rabbi Yosef was a poet, religious scholar, rebuilder of ''Ibn Yahya Synagogue of Calatayud'', well versed in rabbinic literature and in the learning of his time, devoting his early years to the study of Jewish philosophy.

Isaac's grandfather, Samuel Abravanel, was forcibly converted to Christianity during the pogroms of 1391 and took the Spanish name "''Juan Sanchez de Sevilla''".  Samuel fled Castile-León, Spain, in 1397 for Lisbon, Portugal, and reverted to Judaism - shedding his ''[[Converso]]'' after living among Christians for six years.   Conversions outside Judaism, coerced or otherwise, had a strong impact upon young Isaac, later compelling him to forfeit his immense wealth in an attempt to redeem Iberian Jewry from coercion of the [[Alhambra Decree]].  There are parallels between what he writes, and documents produced by Inquisitors, that present [[conversos]] as ambivalent to Christianity and sometimes even ironic in their expressions regarding their new religion - [[crypto-jews]].

=== Leone Ebreo ===
[[Judah Leon Abravanel]] was Portuguese physician, poet and philosopher. His work ''Dialoghi d'amore'' ("Dialogues of Love"), written in Italian, was one of the most important philosophical works of his time. In an attempt to circumvent a plot, hatched by local Catholic Bishops to kidnap his son, Judah sent his son from Castile, to Portugal with a nurse, but by order of the king, the son was seized and baptized.  This was a devastating insult to Judah and his family, and was a source of bitterness throughout Judah's life and the topic of his writings years later; especially since this was not the first time the Abravanel Family was subjected to such embarrassment at the hands of the Catholic Church.

Judah's ''Dialoghi'' is regarded as the finest of Humanistic Period works.  His neoplatonism is derived from the Hispanic Jewish community, especially the works of [[Ibn Gabirol]].  Platonic notions of reaching towards a nearly impossible ideal of beauty, wisdom, and perfection encompass the whole of his work.  In ''Dialoghi d'amore'', Judah defines love in philosophical terms.  He structures his three dialogues as a conversation between two abstract "characters": Philo, representing love or appetite, and Sophia, representing science or wisdom, Philo+Sophia (philosophia).

=== Criticisms of Kabbalah ===
The word "Kabbalah" was used in medieval Jewish texts to mean "tradition", see [[Abraham Ibn Daud]]'s ''Sefer Ha-Qabbalah'' also known as the "Book of our Tradition".  "Book of our Tradition" does not refer to mysticism of any kind - it chronicles "our tradition of scholarship and study" in two Babylonian Academies, through the Geonim, into Talmudic Yeshivas of Spain.  In Talmudic times there was a mystic tradition in Judaism, known as ''Maaseh Bereshith'' (the work of creation) and ''Maaseh Merkavah'' (the work of the chariot); Maimonides interprets these texts as referring to Aristotelian physics and metaphysics as interpreted in the light of Torah.

In the 13th century, however, a mystical-esoteric system emerged which became known as "the [[Kabbalah]]."  Many of the beliefs associated with Kabbalah had long been rejected by philosophers.  [[Saadia Gaon]] had taught in his book ''Emunot v'Deot'' that Jews who believe in [[gilgul]] have adopted a non-Jewish belief.  [[Maimonides]] rejected many texts of ''[[Heichalot]]'', particularly ''[[Shi'ur Qomah]]'' whose anthropomorphic vision of God he considered heretical.

In the 13th century, *Meir ben Simon of Narbonne wrote an epistle (included in ''Milhhemet Mitzvah'') against early Kabbalists, singled out ''[[Sefer Bahir]]'', rejecting the attribution of its authorship to the tanna R. Nehhunya ben ha-Kanah and describing some of its content as follow -

::''"... And we have heard that a book had already been written for them, which they call  Bahir, that is 'bright' but no light shines through it. This book has come into our hands and we have found that they falsely attribute it to Rabbi Nehunya ben Haqqanah. haShem forbid! There is no truth in this... The language of the book and its whole content show that it is the work of someone who lacked command of either literary language or good style, and in many passages it contains words which are out and out heresy."''

}}[[Elia del Medigo]] was a descendant of ''[[Judah ben Eliezer ha-Levi Minz]]'' and ''[[Moses ben Isaac ha-Levi Minz]]''.  Eli'ezer del Medigo, of Rome, received the surname "Del Medigo" after studying Medicine.  The name was later changed from ''Del Medigo'' to ''Ha-rofeh''. He was the father and teacher of a long line of rationalist philosophers and scholars.  Non-Jewish students of Delmedigo classified him as an "Averroist", however, he saw himself as a follower of Maimonides. Scholastic association of Maimonides and Ibn Rushd would have been a natural one; Maimonides, towards the end of his life, was impressed with the Ibn Rushd commentaries and recommended them to his students. The followers of Maimonides (Maimonideans) had therefore been, for several generations before Delmedigo, the leading users, translators and disseminators of the works of Ibn Rushd in Jewish circles, and advocates for Ibn Rushd even after Islamic rejection of his radical views.  Maimonideans regarded Maimonides and Ibn Rushd as following the same general line.  In his book, Delmedigo portrays himself as defender of Maimonidean Judaism, and — like many Maimonideans — he emphasized the rationality of Jewish tradition.

With expulsion from Spain came the dissemination of Jewish philosophical investigation throughout the Mediterranean Basin, Northern Europe and the Western Hemisphere. The center-of-mass of Rationalism shifted to France, Italy, Germany, Crete, Sicily and Netherlands.  Expulsion from Spain and the coordinated pogroms of Europe resulted in the cross-pollination of variations on Rationalism incubated within diverse communities.  This period is also marked by the intellectual exchange among leaders of the Christian Reformation and Jewish scholars.  Of particular note is the line of Rationalists who migrated out of Germany, and present-day Italy into Crete, and other areas of the [[Ottoman Empire]] seeking safety and protection from the endless pogroms fomented by the [[House of Habsburg]] and the [[Roman Catholic Church]] against Jews.

Rationalism was incubating in places far from Spain. From stories told by Rabbi [[Elijah Ba'al Shem of Chelm]], German-speaking Jews, descendants of Jews who migrated back to Jerusalem after Charlemagne's invitation was revoked in Germany many centuries earlier, who lived in Jerusalem during the 11th century, were influenced by prevailing [[Mutazilite]] scholars of Jerusalem. A German-speaking Palestinian Jew saved the life of a young German man surnamed "Dolberger". When the knights of the [[First Crusade]] came to besiege Jerusalem, one of Dolberger's family members rescued German-speaking Jews in Palestine and brought them back to the safety of Worms, Germany, to repay the favor.&lt;ref&gt;"Seder ha-Dorot", p. 252, 1878 ed.&lt;/ref&gt; Further evidence of German communities in the holy city comes in the form of halakic questions sent from Germany to Jerusalem during the second half of the eleventh century.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, in "Monatsschrift", xlvii. 344; Jerusalem: Under the Arabs&lt;/ref&gt;

All of the foregoing resulted in an explosion of new ideas and philosophic paths.

=== Yosef Shlomo ben Eliyahu Dal Medigo ===
[[Joseph Solomon Delmedigo]] was  a physician and teacher – Baruch Spinoza was a student of his works.&lt;ref&gt;"Blesséd Spinoza: a biography of the philosopher", by Lewis Browne, The Macmillan Company, 1932, University of Wisconsin - Madison&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Baruch Spinoza ===
[[File:Spinoza.jpg|thumb|120px|left|[[Baruch Spinoza]]]]
[[Baruch Spinoza]] founded [[Spinozism]], broke with [[Rabbinic Judaism|Rabbinic Jewish]] tradition, and was placed in ''[[Herem (censure)|herem]]'' by the [[Beit Din]] of [[Amsterdam]]. The influence in his work from [[Maimonides]] and [[Leone Ebreo]] is evident. [[Elia del Medigo]] claims to be a student of the works of Spinoza. Some contemporary critics (e.g., Wachter, ''Der Spinozismus im Judenthum'') claimed to detect the influence of the [[Kabbalah]], while others (e.g., [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]]) regarded Spinozism as a revival of [[Averroism]] – a talmudist manner of referencing to Maimonidean Rationalism. In the centuries that have lapsed since the ''herem'' declaration, scholars{{Who|date=March 2014}} have re-examined the works of Spinoza and find them to reflect a body of work and thinking that is not unlike some contemporary streams of Judaism. For instance, while Spinoza was accused of [[pantheism]], scholars{{Who|date=March 2014}} have come to view his work as advocating [[panentheism]], a valid contemporary view easily accommodated by contemporary Judaism.

=== Tzvi Hirsch ben Yaakov Ashkenazi ===
Rabbi [[Tzvi Ashkenazi|Tzvi Hirsch ben Yaakov Ashkenazi]] was a student of his father, but most notably also a student of his grandfather Rabbi [[Elijah Ba'al Shem of Chelm]].

=== Jacob Emden ===
Rabbi [[Jacob Emden]] was a student of his father Rabbi [[Tzvi Ashkenazi|Tzvi Hirsch ben Yaakov Ashkenazi]] a Rabbi in Amsterdam. Emden, a steadfast Talmudist, was a prominent opponent of the [[Sabbateans]] (Messianic Kabbalists who followed Sabbatai Tzvi).  Though anti-Maimonidean, Emden should be noted for his critical examination of the Zohar concluding that large parts of it were forged.

Rabbi [[Leon Modena|Leone di Modena]] wrote that if we{{Who|date=March 2014}} were to accept the Kabbalah, then the Christian trinity would indeed be compatible with Judaism, as the Trinity closely resembles the Kabbalistic doctrine of the Sefirot.

A new era began in the 18th century with the thought of [[Moses Mendelssohn]].  Mendelssohn has been described as the "'third Moses,' with whom begins a new era in Judaism," just as new eras began with [[Moses|Moses the prophet]] and with [[Moses Maimonides]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=446&amp;letter=M |title=Mendelssohn |publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mendelssohn was a [[German Jew]]ish philosopher to whose ideas the renaissance of European Jews, [[Haskalah]] (the Jewish Enlightenment) is indebted. He has been referred to as the father of Reform Judaism, though Reform spokesmen have been "resistant to claim him as their spiritual father".&lt;ref&gt;Wein (1997), p. 44. ([https://books.google.com/books?id=11f9xBbOBBEC&amp;pg=PA44 Google books])&lt;/ref&gt; Mendelssohn came to be regarded as a leading cultural figure of his time by both [[German people|Germans]] and Jews.  His most significant book was ''[[Jerusalem (Mendelssohn)|Jerusalem oder über religiöse Macht und Judentum]]'' (''Jerusalem''), first published in 1783.

Alongside Mendelssohn, other important Jewish philosophers of the eighteenth century included:
* [[Menachem Mendel Lefin]], anti-Hasidic [[Haskalah]] philosopher
* [[Salomon Maimon]], Enlightenment philosopher
* [[Isaac Satanow]], a [[Haskalah]] philosopher
* [[Naphtali Ullman]], [[Haskalah]] philosopher&lt;ref&gt;Shmuel Feiner, ''The Jewish Enlightenment'' 72-3&lt;/ref&gt;

Important Jewish philosophers of the nineteenth century included:
* [[Elijah Benamozegh]], a [[Sephardic]] rabbi and philosopher
* [[Hermann Cohen]], a [[neo-Kantian]] Jewish philosopher
* [[Moses Hess]], a secular Jewish philosopher and one of the founders of [[socialism]]
* [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]], leader of the [[Torah im Derech Eretz]] school of 19th century neo-Orthodoxy
* [[Samuel Hirsch]], a leader of [[Reform Judaism]]
* [[Nachman Krochmal]], [[Haskalah]] philosopher in [[Galicia (eastern Europe)|Galicia]]
* [[Samuel David Luzzatto]] a [[Sephardic]] rabbi and philosopher
* [[Karl Marx]], German [[economist]] and Jewish philosopher.

=== Traditionalist attitudes towards philosophy ===
{{main|Haredi Judaism|Hasidic philosophy}}
[[Haredi]] traditionalists who emerged in reaction to the [[Haskalah]] considered the fusion of religion and philosophy as difficult because classical philosophers start with no preconditions for which conclusions they must reach in their investigation, while classical religious believers have a set of religious principles of faith that they hold one must believe.  Most Haredim contended that one cannot simultaneously be a philosopher and a true adherent of a revealed religion.  In this view, all attempts at synthesis ultimately fail.  Rabbi [[Nachman of Breslov]], for example, viewed all philosophy as untrue and heretical.  In this he represents one strand of [[Hasidic]] thought, with creative emphasis on the emotions.

Other exponents of [[Hasidic philosophy|Hasidism]] had a more positive attitude towards philosophy.  In the [[Chabad]] writings of [[Schneur Zalman of Liadi]], Hasidut is seen as able to unite all parts of Torah thought, from the schools of philosophy to mysticism, by uncovering the illuminating Divine essence that permeates and transcends all approaches.  Interpreting the verse from [[Book of Job|Job]], "from my flesh I see [[HaShem]]", Shneur Zalman explained the inner meaning, or "soul", of the Jewish mystical tradition in intellectual form, by means of analogies drawn from the human realm.  As explained and continued by the later leaders of Chabad, this enabled the human mind to grasp concepts of Godliness, and so enable the heart to feel the love and awe of God, emphasised by all the founders of hasidism, in an internal way.  This development, the culminating level of the Jewish mystical tradition, in this way bridges philosophy and mysticism, by expressing the transcendent in human terms.

== 20th and 21st-century Jewish philosophy ==
[[File:Martin Buber portrait.jpg|thumb|[[Martin Buber]]]]

=== Jewish existentialism ===
{{main|Jewish existentialism}}
One of the major trends in modern Jewish philosophy was the attempt to develop a theory of Judaism through [[existentialism]].  Among the early Jewish existentialist philosophers was [[Lev Shestov]] (Jehuda Leib Schwarzmann), a Russian-Jewish philosopher.  One of the most influential Jewish existentialists in the first half of the 20th century was [[Franz Rosenzweig]].  While researching his doctoral dissertation on the 19th-century German philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], Rosenzweig reacted against Hegel's idealism and developed an existential approach.  Rosenzweig, for a time, considered conversion to Christianity, but in 1913, he turned to Jewish philosophy. He became a philosopher and student of [[Hermann Cohen]].  Rozensweig's major work, ''Star of Redemption'', is his new philosophy in which he portrays the relationships between haShem, humanity and world as they are connected by creation, revelation and redemption. Orthodox rabbi [[Joseph Soloveitchik]]{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} and Conservative rabbis [[Neil Gillman]]{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} and [[Elliot N. Dorff]]{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} have also been described as existentialists.

The [[France|French]] philosopher and [[Talmudic]] commentator [[Emmanuel Levinas]], whose approach grew out of the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] tradition in philosophy, has also been described as a Jewish existentialist.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin A. Wurgaft, [http://www.myjewishlearning.com/beliefs/Theology/Thinkers_and_Thought/Jewish_Philosophy/Philosophies/Modern/Emmanuel_Levinas.shtml Emmanuel Levinas], myjewishlearning.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jewish rationalism ===
[[File:Hermann Cohen (lithograph by Karl Doerbecker).jpg|thumb|left|[[Hermann Cohen]]]]

Rationalism has re-emerged as a popular perspective among Jews.&lt;ref&gt;"Jewish Rationalism Reemergent," ''Conservative Judaism,'' Volume 36, Issue 4, Page 81&lt;/ref&gt;  Contemporary Jewish rationalism often draws on ideas associated with medieval philosophers such as [[Maimonides]] and modern Jewish rationalists such as [[Hermann Cohen]].

Cohen was a German Jewish neo-Kantian philosopher who turned to Jewish subjects at the end of his career in the early 20th century, picking up on ideas of [[Maimonides]].  In America, [[Steven Schwarzschild]] continued Cohen's legacy.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Schwarzschild, "To Re-Cast Rationalism," ''Judaism'' 2 (1962).&lt;/ref&gt;  Another prominent contemporary Jewish rationalist is [[Lenn Goodman]], who works out of the traditions of medieval Jewish rationalist philosophy.  [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] rabbis [[Alan Mittleman]] of the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America|Jewish Theological Seminary]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jtsa.edu/x12578.xml |title=The Jewish Theological Seminary |publisher=Jtsa.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-10-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313185226/http://www.jtsa.edu/x12578.xml |archivedate=2013-03-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Elliot N. Dorff]] of [[American Jewish University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adath-shalom.ca/dorf_rev.htm |title=From Medievaland Modern Theories Of Revelation By Elliot N. Dorff |publisher=Adath-shalom.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; also see themselves in the rationalist tradition, as does David Novak of the [[University of Toronto]].&lt;ref&gt;''Tradition in the public square: a David Novak reader'', page xiv&lt;/ref&gt;  Novak works in the natural law tradition, which is one version of rationalism.

Philosophers in modern-day Israel in the rationalist tradition include [[David Hartman (rabbi)|David Hartman]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://etd.lib.fsu.edu/theses/available/etd-09182003-143438/unrestricted/07_aed_chapter2.pdf |title=Halakhic Latitudinarianism: David Hartman on the commanded life |publisher=Etd.lib.fsu.edu |accessdate=2012-10-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120624183933/http://etd.lib.fsu.edu/theses/available/etd-09182003-143438/unrestricted/07_aed_chapter2.pdf |archivedate=2012-06-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Moshe Halbertal]].&lt;ref&gt;Noam Zion, [http://www.hartmaninstitute.com/uploads/Holidays/Elu-02062008_0957_45.pdf Elu v'Elu: Two Schools of Halakha Face Off On Issues of Human Autonomy, Majority Rule and Divine Voice of Authority], p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Orthodox rationalists in Israel take a "restorationist"{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} approach, reaching back in time for tools to simplify Rabbinic Judaism and bring all Jews, regardless of status or stream of Judaism, closer to observance of Halacha, Mitzvot, Kashrut and embrace of [[Maimonides]]' "13 Principles of Faith".  [[Dor Daim]], and [[Dor Daim#Talmide ha-Rambam|Rambamists]] are two groups who reject mysticism as a "superstitious innovation" to an otherwise clear and succinct set of Laws and rules.  According to these rationalists, there is shame and disgrace attached to failure to investigate matters of religious principle using the fullest powers of human reason and intellect.  One cannot be considered wise, or perceptive, if one does not attempt to understand the origins, and establish the correctness, of one's beliefs.

=== Holocaust theology ===
{{main|Holocaust theology}}
Judaism has traditionally taught that God is [[Omnipotence|omnipotent]], [[Omniscience|omniscient]] and [[omnibenevolence|omnibenevolent]]. Yet, these claims are in jarring contrast with the fact that there is much [[evil]] in the world. Perhaps the most difficult question that monotheists have confronted is "how can one reconcile the existence of this view of God with the existence of evil?" or "how can there be good without bad?"  "how can there be a God without a devil?" This is [[the problem of evil]].  Within all monotheistic faiths many answers ([[theodicy|theodicies]]) have been proposed.  However, in light of the magnitude of evil seen in the [[Holocaust]], many people have re-examined classical views on this subject. How can people still have any kind of faith after the Holocaust?  This set of Jewish philosophies is discussed in the article on [[Holocaust theology]].

=== Reconstructionist theology ===
{{main|Reconstructionist Judaism}}
Perhaps the most controversial form of Jewish philosophy that developed in the early 20th century was the religious naturalism of Rabbi [[Mordecai Kaplan]].  His theology was a variant of [[John Dewey]]'s [[pragmatism|pragmatist]] philosophy.  Dewey's naturalism combined atheist beliefs with religious terminology in order to construct a philosophy for those who had lost faith in traditional Judaism.  In agreement with the classical medieval Jewish thinkers, Kaplan affirmed that haShem is not personal, and that all anthropomorphic descriptions of haShem are, at best, imperfect metaphors.  Kaplan's theology went beyond this to claim that haShem is the sum of all natural processes that allow man to become self-fulfilled.  Kaplan wrote that "to believe in haShem means to take for granted that it is man's destiny to rise above the brute and to eliminate all forms of violence and exploitation from human society."

=== Process theology ===
A recent trend has been to reframe Jewish theology through the lens of [[process philosophy]], more specifically [[process theology]]. Process philosophy suggests that fundamental elements of the universe are occasions of experience.  According to this notion, what people commonly think of as concrete objects are actually successions of these occasions of experience. Occasions of experience can be collected into groupings; something complex such as a human being is thus a grouping of many smaller occasions of experience. In this view, everything in the universe is characterized by experience (not to be confused with consciousness); there is no mind-body duality under this system, because "mind" is simply seen as a very developed kind of experiencing entity.

Intrinsic to this worldview is the notion that all experiences are influenced by prior experiences, and will influence all future experiences.  This process of influencing is never deterministic; an occasion of experience consists of a process of comprehending other experiences, and then reacting to it.  This is the "process" in "process philosophy". Process philosophy gives God a special place in the universe of occasions of experience. God encompasses all the other occasions of experience but also transcends them; thus process philosophy is a form of [[panentheism]].

The original ideas of process theology were developed by [[Charles Hartshorne]] (1897–2000), and influenced a number of [[Judaism|Jewish]] theologians, including [[United Kingdom|British]] philosopher Samuel Alexander (1859–1938), and [[Rabbis]] [[Max Kadushin]], Milton Steinberg and Levi A. Olan, Harry Slominsky, and [[Bradley Shavit Artson]].  [[Abraham Joshua Heschel]] has also been linked to this tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Donald J.|title=The Human and the Holy: The Spirituality of Abraham Joshua Heschel|year=1989|publisher=Fordham University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0823212361|pages=82–83|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LdfdS5YwOHoC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kabbalah and philosophy ===
Kabbalah continued to be central to [[Haredi Orthodox Judaism]], which generally rejected philosophy, although the [[Chabad]] strain of [[Chasidism]] showed a more positive attitude towards philosophy. Meanwhile, non-Orthodox Jewish thought in the latter 20th century saw resurgent interest in [[Kabbalah]]. In academic studies, [[Gershom Scholem]] began the critical investigation of Jewish mysticism, while in non-Orthodox [[Jewish denominations]], [[Jewish Renewal]] and [[Neo-Hasidism]], spiritualised worship. Many philosophers do not consider this a form of philosophy, as Kabbalah is a collection of esoteric methods of textual interpretation. Mysticism is generally understood as an alternative to philosophy, not a variant of philosophy.

Among modern the modern critics of Kabbalah was [[Yihhyah Qafahh]], who wrote a book entitled ''[[Milhamoth ha-Shem]]'', (''Wars of the Name'') against what he perceived as the false teachings of the Zohar and the false Kabbalah of Isaac Luria. He is credited with spearheading the [[Dor Daim]]. [[Yeshayahu Leibowitz]] publicly shared the views expressed in Rabbi [[Yihhyah Qafahh]]'s book ''Milhhamoth ha-Shem'' and elaborated upon these views in his many writings.

==== Jewish philosophers whose philosophy is not necessarily focused on Jewish themes ====
In the twentieth and twenty-first centuries there have also been many philosophers who are Jewish or of Jewish descent, and whose Jewish background might influence their approach to some degree, but whose writing is not necessarily focused on issues specific to Judaism.  These include:
* [[Theodor W. Adorno]]
* [[Joseph Agassi]], an Israeli philosopher of science who developed [[Karl Popper]]'s ideas&lt;ref&gt;As early as 1934 [[Karl Popper]] wrote of the search for truth as "one of the strongest motives for scientific discovery." Still, he describes in ''Objective Knowledge'' (1972) early concerns about the much-criticized notion of truth as correspondence. Then came the semantic theory of truth formulated by the logician Alfred Tarski and published in 1933. Popper writes of learning in 1935 of the consequences of Tarski's theory, to his intense joy. The theory met critical objections to truth as correspondence and thereby rehabilitated it. The theory also seemed, in Popper's eyes, to support metaphysical realism and the regulative idea of a search for truth. Popper coined the term critical rationalism to describe his philosophy. Contemporary Jewish philosophers who follow Popper's philosophy include [[Joseph Agassi]], [[Adi Ophir]] and [[Yehuda Elkana]].&lt;/ref&gt;

A {{Nihongo|'''jikijitsu'''|直日|}} (Chinese: chih-jih) is the directing monk in charge of every movement of the monks coming to sit [[zazen]] in the [[zendo]] in a [[Japan]]ese [[Zen]] [[monastery]] of the [[Rinzai School]].&lt;ref name=Suz&gt;{{cite book|pages=93, 148, 159|isbn=1-59605-041-1|publisher=Cosimo Classics via Amazon.com Look Inside|url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Training-Zen-Buddhist-Monk/dp/1596050411/|year=2004|title=The Training of the Zen Buddhist Monk|author=Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their position is that of head monk, and they are generally regarded as strict disciplinarians. Their position is considered most desirable to hold in the meditation hall. The jikijitsu also ensures that the monks get to sleep and wake up on time according to a strict protocol.

==History==
Originally the name was given to the monk who was assigned to take care of the monastery's robes and bowls. The monks rotated this duty among themselves each day. Today a monk may be appointed to the position for the duration of a sesshin (possibly more than one consecutive day).&lt;ref name=Baroni /&gt;

==Timekeeper==
The jikijitsu is the [[timekeeper]] for sessions of ''zazen'', ''[[kinhin]]'' (walking meditation), and meals.&lt;ref name=Baroni&gt;{{cite book|title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Zen Buddhism|author=Baroni, Helen Josephine|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group via Google Books|year=2002|isbn=0-8239-2240-5|page=161|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=smNM4ElP3XgC&amp;pg=PA161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Times during the daily schedule are signalled with [[wood block]]s called ''han'' and with [[gong]]s, [[umpan]]s and [[handbell]]s.&lt;ref name=Baroni /&gt;

==Keisaku==
During zazen, the jikijitsu will walk around the zendo wielding a [[keisaku]] (a "staff of admonition" or Zen stick, Chinese: ching ts'e),&lt;ref name=Suz /&gt; which is used to strike a student's back when they have lost focus. These strikes are generally not violent, and will often relieve [[muscle cramp]]s for the individual being struck. They sound like a loud whack and can terrify newcomers, but they "are not particularly painful".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Snyder, Gary|title=Look Out: A Selection of Writings|page=97|publisher=New Directions via Amazon.com Look Inside|isbn=0-8112-1525-3|year=2002|url=https://www.amazon.com/Look-Out-Selection-Writings-Directions/dp/0811215253/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Rinzai]] school, the jikijitsu may strike a student without a student's request if they feel the student has gone astray. In the [[Sōtō]] school, a student will ask for a blow by placing both palms together in ''[[gassho]]'' as the jikijitsu walks in front of them.&lt;ref&gt;Kushner, 83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rohlen, 38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gard, 193&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Johann Jakob Müller was born at [[Jena]] in 1650.   His father, another Johann Müller (1615-1688), was the deputy head of the [[:de:Bürgerschule|city school]].   Johann Jakob Müller attended the school, then under the rectorship of Johann Martin Ringler.   Recognising an exceptional talent, his parents also arranged for him to receive private tutoring at home from Anton Mosnern, a churchman from nearby [[Saalfeld]].   Aged only 15 Müller started attending lectures at [[University of Jena|the university]].   At the [[Philosophy]] faculty his teachers included [[Johann Frischmuth]], [[Erhard Weigel]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Caspar Posner|de}}, {{Interlanguage link multi|Johann Andreas Bose|de}}, {{Interlanguage link multi|Valentin Veltheim|de}}, [[Johannes Musaeus]], [[Johann Wilhelm Baier]] and [[Friedemann Bechmann]].&lt;ref name=JJMlautZedler/&gt;

In 1677 Müller received his degree, becoming a [[Magister degree|Master]] of [[Philosophy]].   At the university he became an [[Adjunct professor|Adjunct]] in the Philosophy faculty, supplementing his income with an appointment as a domestic tutor further to north.&lt;ref name=JJMlautZedler/&gt;   For the next thirty years he published a succession of [[disputation]]s on a range of ethical topics.

On 12 April 1692 he was appointed Visiting Professor in Philosophy at [[University of Jena|Jena]].   On 8 January 1695 he was appointed full Professor of Poetry and on 14 September 1698 he received the teaching chair in [[Logic]].   After receiving a [[Licentiate (degree)|licentiate]] in [[:de:Lizenziat der Rechtswissenschaft|Laws]] on 23 October 1699,on 18 February 1700 he received his [[Doctor of law|Doctorate of laws]].   On 5 September 1705 he took on the professorship of Ethical Moral Philosophy and Politics.

Müller also took his turn at administrative duties, serving several times as dean of the Philosophy faculty.   During the Winter Term of 1704/05 he served as [[Rector (academia)|Rector]]  at the [[University of Jena]].&lt;ref name=Jenarectors&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uni-jena.de/unijenamedia/Downloads/einrichtungen/archiv/Rektorentabelle+2014.pdf| page=13| title=Die Rektoren/Prorektoren und Präsidenten der Universität Jena 1548/49-2014|author=Dr. Thomas Pester| publisher=Universitätsarchiv Jena|accessdate=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joseph Henry Woodger''' (2 May 1894&amp;nbsp;– 8 March 1981) was a British [[theoretical biology|theoretical biologist]] and [[philosophy of biology|philosopher of biology]] whose attempts to make biological sciences more rigorous and empirical was significantly influential to the philosophy of biology in the twentieth century. [[Karl Popper]], the prominent philosopher of science,  claimed "Woodger... influenced and stimulated the evolution of the philosophy of science in Britain and in the United States as hardly anybody else".&lt;ref name=Popper1981&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Popper | first1=Karl | year=1981 | title=Obituary: Joseph Henry Woodger | journal=[[British Journal for the Philosophy of Science]] | volume=32 | issue=3 | pages=328–330 | doi=10.1093/bjps/32.3.328 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and work==
Joseph Woodger was born at [[Great Yarmouth]] in [[Norfolk]], and studied at [[University College London]] from 1911 until 1922, except for a period serving in the [[First World War]]. He then became a [[reader (academic rank)|reader]] at the [[University of London]] [[Middlesex Hospital]] Medical School.  He became a [[professor]] there in 1947, and eventually retired in 1959 as [[emeritus professor]] of [[biology]]. He was a member of the [[Theoretical Biology Club]] along with [[Joseph Needham]], [[C. H. Waddington|Conrad Hal Waddington]], [[John Desmond Bernal]], and [[Dorothy Wrinch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bowler, Peter J. |title=Reconciling science and religion: the debate in early-twentieth-century Britain |publisher= |date=2001 |page= |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Morange, Michel Morange; Cobb, Matthew |title=A history of molecular biology |publisher= |date=2000 |page=91 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge scientific minds, Peter Michael Harman, Simon Mitton, 2002, p. 302&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lawrence, Christopher; Weisz, George |title=Greater than the parts: holism in biomedicine, 1920–1950 |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1998 |page=12 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Popper]] described the club as "one of the most interesting study circles in the field of the philosophy of science."{{cn|date=June 2018}}

==Family==
Woodger was known to friends and family as "[[Socrates]]", and with his wife Eden (born Buckle) he lived at [[Epsom]] in [[Surrey]], where they had four children. His eldest child was [[Mike Woodger]] (born 1923), a computer pioneer who worked with [[Alan Turing]] at the [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory]], leading to the early [[Pilot ACE]] computer.&lt;ref name="yates10"&gt;{{cite article| url=http://www.computerconservationsociety.org/resurrection/res50.htm#d | first=David | last=Yates | title=Pioneer Profile: Michael Woodger | journal=Computer Resurrection&amp;nbsp;– [[The Bulletin of the Computer Conservation Society]] | volume=50 | date=Spring 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He died in 1981.&lt;ref name=Popper1981/&gt;

==On scientific method==
{{further|Modern synthesis (20th century)#Woodger}}

Woodger led the introduction of [[logical positivism|positivist]] philosophy of science into biology with his 1929 book ''Biological Principles'',&lt;ref name=Smocovitis/&gt; for which he has been roundly if unfairly criticised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Nicholson| first1=Daniel J. | last2=Gawne | first2=Richard | title=Rethinking Woodger’s Legacy in the Philosophy of Biology | journal=[[Journal of the History of Biology]] | date=19 July 2013 | volume=47 | issue=2 | pages=243–292 | doi=10.1007/s10739-013-9364-x }}&lt;/ref&gt; He saw a mature [[science]] as being characterised by a framework of [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] which could be verified by facts established by [[experiment]]s. He criticised the traditional [[natural history]] style of [[biology]], including the study of [[evolution]], as immature science, since it relied on [[narrative]].&lt;ref name=Smocovitis&gt;{{cite book |last=Smocovitis |first=Vassiliki Betty |year=1996 |title=Unifying Biology: The Evolutionary Synthesis and Evolutionary Biology |location=Princeton, NJ |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0-691-03343-9 |pages=100–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, he wrote "Admittedly, some hypotheses have become so well established that no one doubts them. But this does not mean that they are known to be true. We cannot determine the truth of a hypothesis by counting the number of people who believe it, and a hypothesis does not cease to be a hypothesis when a lot of people believe it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Woodger | first1=J. H. | title=Observations on the present state of embryology | journal=Symposium of the [[Society for Experimental Biology]] | date=1948 | volume=2 | issue=Growth in Relation to Differentiation and Morphogenesis | page=354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Woodger set out to play for biology the role of [[Robert Boyle]]'s ''[[Sceptical Chymist]]'', intending to convert the subject into a formal, unified science, and ultimately, following the [[Vienna Circle]] of logical positivists like [[Otto Neurath]] and [[Rudolf Carnap]], [[reductionism|to reduce]] biology to physics and chemistry. His efforts stimulated the biologist [[J. B. S. Haldane]] to push for the axiomatisation of biology, and helped to bring about the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] of evolutionary biology, combining [[genetics]], [[evolution]], [[ecology]] and other disciplines.&lt;ref name=Smocovitis/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1851">The '''khirqa''' is the initiatory cloak of the [[Sufi]] chain of spirituality, with which [[esoteric]] knowledge and [[barakah]] is passed from the [[Murshid]] or the [[Sheikh|Shaikh]] to the aspirant [[murid]]. The khirqa initiates an aspirant into the [[silsilah]], the chain or lineage of sheikhs that goes back to the Islamic prophet, [[Muhammad]]. This chain serves as the channel through which barakah flows from the source of spiritual revelation to the being of the initiate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hoffman|first=Valerie|title=Sufism, Mysticism, and Saints in Modern Egypt|year=1995|publisher=University of South Carolina Press|location=Columbia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subdivisions==
There are two kinds of this kind of transmission (tanakkul) of barakah through the khirqa: khirqa-yi irada and khirqa-yi tabarruk.  Khirqa-yi irada is characterized by the passing of barakah to the aspirant from the singular sheikh to which he or she has pledged allegiance ([[bay'at]]).  Khirqa-yi tabarruk, also known as the "frock of blessing", is characterized by the passing of barakah to the worthy aspirant from any sheikh that he or she has encountered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schimmel|first=Annemarie|title=Mystical Dimensions of Islam|year=1975|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
The silsilah chain created from the passing of the khirqa that confirms authenticity of many [[hadith]]s is a form of [[isnad]].  It was not until the late eleventh and twelfth centuries that [[Sufism]] accepted this form of [[isnad]] as a means to transmit mystical knowledge and blessings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Jonathan|title=Hadith: Muhammad's Legacy in the Medieval and Modern World|year=2009|publisher=Oneworld Publications|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Hindu]] epic ''[[Mahabharata]]'', '''Kindama''' was a [[rishi]] who lived in the woods.

== Cursing King Pandu ==
Kindama was a very bashful person and his overriding feelings of modesty prevented him from having sex in the company of other humans. To satisfy his sexual desires, Kindama used his powers to turn himself into a deer and took a female deer as mate. Once he and his mate were having [[Sexual intercourse|intercourse]] in the woods. King [[Pandu]] of [[Hastinapur]], who had been hunting there, shot them mistaking them for deers, seriously injuring them. Enraged Kindama (still in deer form) berated the king for having killed him before he had finished the act of copulation. Before dying, Kindama cursed Pandu that he would die the moment he engaged in intercourse with any woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Uberoi|first=Meera|title=The Mahabharata|isbn=9788170702313}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pattanaik|first=Devdutt|title=The goddess in India: the five faces of the eternal feminine|year=2000|publisher=Inner Traditions International|location=Rochester, Vt|isbn=9780892818075}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Kindama’s curse, [[Pandu]] renounced everything and became a [[hermit]]. [[Dhritarashtra]] the blind brother of Pandu, became the king of [[Hastinapur]]. His first wife [[Kunti]] managed to give birth to three sons  ([[Yudhishtira]], [[Bhima]] and [[Arjuna]]) with the help of gods, without Pandu's involvement. Kunti later gave a portion of this power to Pandu's second wife [[Madri]], who also gave birth to two sons ([[Nakula]] and [[Sahadeva]]). Then, after a long time, Pandu was so enthralled by his second wife, [[Madri]]'s womanly manners, that he could no longer contain his desires. As soon as he attempted intercourse with Madri, he died. Madri [[Sati (practice)|immolated]] herself in her husband’s pyre.

&lt;!-- Missing image removed: [[Image:Kwasi Wiredu, B. Phil.jpg|thumb]] --&gt;
'''Kwasi Wiredu''' (born 3 October 1931) is an [[African philosophy|African philosopher]].

==Biography==

Wiredu was born in [[Kumasi]], [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] (present-day [[Ghana]]), in 1931, and attended [[Adisadel College]] from 1948 to 1952. It was during this period that he discovered philosophy, through [[Plato]] (which weaned him from his interest in Practical Psychology) and [[Bertrand Russell]]. he gained a place at the [[University of Ghana]], [[Legon]]. After graduating in 1958, he went to [[University College, Oxford]] to read for the [[Bachelor of Philosophy|B.Phil.]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

At Oxford Wiredu was taught by [[Gilbert Ryle]] (his thesis supervisor), [[Peter Strawson]] (his College tutor), and [[Stuart Hampshire]] (his special tutor), and wrote a thesis on "Knowledge, Truth, and Reason". Upon graduating in 1960 he was appointed to a teaching post at the [[University College of North Staffordshire]] (now the [[University of Keele]]), where he stayed for a year. He returned to Ghana, where he accepted a post teaching philosophy for his old university. He remained at the University of Ghana for twenty-three years, during which time he became first Head of Department and then Professor. In 1987, he held a professorship at the [[University of South Florida]] in [[Tampa]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Wiredu has held a number of visiting professorships:
*[[University of California, Los Angeles]], California (1979&amp;ndash;1980)
*[[University of Ibadan]], [[Nigeria]] (1984)
*[[University of Richmond]], [[Virginia]] (1985)
*[[Carleton College]], [[Minnesota]] (1986)
*[[Duke University]], [[North Carolina]] (1994&amp;ndash;95; 1999&amp;ndash;2001){{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

He was a member of the Committee of Directors of the [[International Federation of Philosophical Societies]] from 1983 to 1998. He has also been a fellow at the [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]] (1985) and the [[National Humanities Center]], North Carolina (1986).{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

He is Vice-President of the Inter-African Council for Philosophy.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==Philosophical work==
One of Wiredu's concerns when defining "African Philosophy" is keeping colonialised African philosophy in a separate category from precolonised Africa. Wiredu (1998) proposes that the African philosopher has a unique opportunity to re-examine many of the assumptions of Western philosophers by subjecting them to an interrogation based on African languages. Let's say hypothetically an African was born and raised in China. Their thoughts and philosophy will be biased to the culture of the language. Not only will they naturally philosophise in that language, but also shape their life around that language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wiredu|first1=Kwasi|title=Toward Decolonizing African Philosophy and Religion|journal=African Studies Quarterly|year=1998|volume=1|issue=4|page=17|url=http://asq.africa.ufl.edu/files/Vol-1-Issue-4-Wiredu.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wiredu opposes the [[Ethnophilosophy|ethnophilosophical]]" and "philosophical sagacity" approaches to [[African philosophy]], arguing that all cultures have their distinctive folk-beliefs and world-views, but that these must be distinguished from the practice of philosophising.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} It is not that "folk philosophy" cannot play a part in genuine philosophy; on the contrary, he has acknowledged his own debt to his own ([[Akan people|Akan]]) culture's history of thought. Rather, he argues that genuine philosophy demands the application to such thought of critical analysis and rigorous argument.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.uta.edu/philosophy/faculty/burgess-jackson/Interview.pdf Reginald M.J. Oduor, “African Philosophy, and Non-human Animals” (interview with Anteneh Roba and Rainer Ebert)]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Wiredu's most prominent discussions revolves around the Akan concept of personhood. He believes this traditional framework hosts a two part conception of a person. First, and most intuitive to Western conceptions of persons, is the ontological dimension. This includes one's biological constitution. Further, Wiredu states that the second dimension, the normative conception of personhood, is based on one's ability to will freely. One's ability to will freely is dependent on one's ethical considerations. One can be said to have free will if one has a high regard to ethical responsibilities. This then designates a person to become a person. One is not born a person but becomes one through events and experiences that lead one to act ethically. This differs from the Western conception of personhood in that people, in traditional Akan thought, are not born as willed beings. Wiredu also is certain that African tradition is not "purely theoretical because he shows how certain aspects of African political thought may be applied to the practical resolution of some of Africa's most pressing problems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=African Philosophy|url=http://www.ascleiden.nl/content/webdossiers/african-philosophy|publisher=African Studies Center Leiden|accessdate=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His influences include, apart from his tutors at Oxford, [[David Hume]], and [[Immanuel Kant]], and the [[American Pragmatism|pragmatist]] [[John Dewey]], and the [[epistemological]], metaphysical, and ethical resources of the Akan culture. The result is philosophy that is at once universally relevant and essentially African.

Wiredu, in his work, has enlightened many people on the philosophy and religion of Africa. Not only does he summarise and outline their beliefs in many of his works but he also challenges outsiders predispositions to African beliefs. He wants to shed light and understanding to their belief systems and what they believe to be true and physical. He expresses his thoughts and ideas in The Routledge Companion to Philosophy of Religion on African Religions.&lt;ref name="African Religions"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meister|first1=Chad|last2=Copan|first2=Paul|title=The Routledge Companion to Philosophy of religion|date=2012|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon, Oxon|isbn=9780415782951|pages=30–38|edition=Second Edition.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Laches''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|æ|tʃ|ɪ|z}} "latches", {{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|eɪ|tʃ|ɪ|z}} {{respell|LAY|chiz}};  [[Law French]]: ''remissness'', ''dilatoriness'', from Old French ''laschesse'') refers to a lack of diligence and activity in making a legal claim, or moving forward with legal enforcement of a right, particularly in regard to [[equity (law)|equity]]; hence, it is an ''unreasonable'' delay that can be viewed as prejudicing the opposing [defending] party. When asserted in litigation, it is an [[Equity (law)|equity]] defense, that is, a defense to a claim for an equitable remedy. The person invoking laches is asserting that an opposing party has "slept on its rights", and that, as a result of this delay, circumstances have changed, witnesses or evidence may have been lost or no longer available, etc., such that it is no longer a just resolution to grant the [[plaintiff]]'s claim. Laches is associated with the maxim of equity, "Equity aids the vigilant, not the sleeping ones [that is, those who sleep on their rights]." Put another way, failure to assert one’s rights in a timely manner can result in a claim being barred by laches.

==Origin, definition, overview==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2016}}
Laches is a legal term derived from the [[Old French]] ''laschesse,'' meaning "remissness" or "dilatoriness," and is viewed as the opposite of "vigilance."&lt;ref name="bld"&gt;{{cite book| chapter = Laches [Definition of 'laches' by Black's]  | title=Black's Law Dictionary | year=2009 | edition=9th | editor-last=Garner|editor-first=Bryan A. | isbn=0314199497 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=weU2AQAAIAAJ | accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|Laches [Definition of 'laches' by OED]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/laches|title=Laches [Definition of 'laches' by Merriam-Webster]|author=|date=|work=merriam-webster.com|accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States Supreme Court case ''Costello v.

THE FOLLOWING TEXT FROM THIS POINT FORWARD IS USED ALMOST VERBATIM IN THE ARTICLE'S INTRODUCTION. SOMEONE VERY MUCH NEEDS TO SIMPLY DELETE ALL THIS SECTION'S CONTENT BELOW HERE, ADDITIONALLY RETITLING THIS HERE SECTION AS "ORIGINS OF USAGE" OR "ETYMOLOGICAL HISTORY", AND THEN INCORPORATE WHATEVER ADDITIONAL FRAGMENTS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN REPEATED WORD FOR WORD INTO THE INTRO SECTION, WHERE IT BEST BELONGS! ONCE AGAIN, THERE SHOULD NEVER BE SUCH AN INSTANCE WHERE TWO DIFFERENT SECTIONS (AND FURTHERMORE, SUCH SECTIONS NO LESS BEING PRESENTED BACK TO BACK, JUST AS THEY ARE HERE.) IN ESSENCE ARE REPEATED, QUITE LITERALLY, WORD FOR WORD; INVOLVING THE REPETITION OF, NOT MERELY SOME ROGUE SENTENCE FRAGMENT OR TWO, BUT RATHER AN ENTIRE (A QUITE LENGTHY ONE, AT THAT) PARAGRAPH'S WORTH OF VERBATIM COPIED AND PASTED CONTENT WITH ONLY MINOR ADDITIONAL SENTENCES INTERSPERSED IN-BETWEEN. 
--&gt; Invoking laches is a reference to a lack of diligence and activity in making a legal claim, or moving forward with legal enforcement of a right, in particular with regard to [[equity (law)|equity]], and so is an "unreasonable delay pursuing a right or claim, in a way that prejudices the [opposing] party".&lt;ref name="bld" /&gt; When asserted in litigation, it is an [[Equity (law)|equitable]] defense, that is, a defense to a claim for an equitable remedy.&lt;ref name="Little Bit of Laches"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.vanderbiltlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/89/2014/01/Bray-Essay.pdf |title=A Little Bit of Laches Goes a Long Way: Notes on Petrella v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc. |volume=67 |pages=1–18 |journal=[[Vanderbilt Law Review]] En Banc | first=Samuel |last=Bray | date=2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The essential element of ''laches'' is an unreasonable delay by the plaintiff in bringing the claim; because laches is an equitable defense, it is ordinarily applied only to claims for equitable relief (such as injunctions), and not to claims for legal relief (such as damages).&lt;ref name="Little Bit of Laches" /&gt; The person invoking laches is asserting that an opposing party has "slept on its rights", and that, as a result of this delay, witnesses and/or evidence may have been lost or no longer available, and circumstances have changed such that it is no longer just to grant the [[plaintiff]]'s original claim;{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} hence, laches is associated with the maxim of equity: ''Vigilantibus non dormientibus æquitas subvenit'' ("Equity aids the vigilant, not the sleeping ones [that is, those who sleep on their rights]").&lt;ref name="Ibrahim" &gt;{{cite journal | author = Ibrahim, Ashraf Ray | jstor = 1073651 | title = The Doctrine of Laches in International Law | journal = Virginia Law Review | volume = 83 | issue = 3 |pages = 647–692 | date = April 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Put another way, failure to assert one’s rights in a timely manner can result in a claim being barred by laches. Sometimes courts will also require that the party invoking the doctrine has changed its position as a result of the delay, but that requirement is more typical of the related (but more stringent) defense and equally cause of action of [[estoppel]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

==Components==
{{one source|section|date=January 2016}}
{{refimprove science|section|date=January 2016}}
A claim of laches requires the following components:(1) a delay in bringing the action, (2) a delay that is unreasonable and (3) that prejudices the defendant.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}&lt;ref name="danjaq"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-9th-circuit/1040539.html|title=Danjaq LLC MGM UA v. SONY Corporation|author=|date=|work=Findlaw|accessdate=5 January 2016}}{{primary source inline|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=January 2016}}

===Delay===
The period of delay begins when the plaintiff knew, or reasonably ought to have known, that the cause of action existed; the period of delay ends only when the legal action is formally filed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.modeljuryinstructions.com/tag/laches/&lt;/ref&gt; Informing or warning the defendant of the cause of action (for example by sending a cease-and-desist letter or merely ''threatening'' a lawsuit) does ''not'', by itself, end the period of delay.&lt;ref name="danjaq"/&gt;{{primary source inline|date=January 2016}}

===Unreasonableness===
To invoke laches the delay by the opposing party in initiating the lawsuit must be '''unreasonable'''.  The courts have recognized the following causes of delay as reasonable:{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}
* the exhaustion of remedies through the administrative process
* the evaluation and preparation of a complicated claim
* to determine whether the scope of proposed infringement will justify the cost of litigation&lt;ref name="danjaq"/&gt;{{primary source inline|date=January 2016}}

By contrast, it is ''not'' reasonable to delay a lawsuit to "capitalize on the value of the infringer's labor".  In ''Danjaq v. Sony'', the Ninth Circuit decided that a screenwriter who waited for a film studio to publicize and distribute a film based on a script he allegedly owned had delayed his lawsuit unreasonably.&lt;ref name="danjaq"/&gt;{{primary source inline|date=January 2016}}

===Prejudice===
Unreasonable delay must prejudice the defendant.  Examples of such prejudice include:{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}
* evidence favorable to the defendant becoming lost or degraded
* witnesses favorable to the defendant dying or losing their memories
* the defendant making economic decisions (e.g. investing in a movie or a manufacturing process) that it would not have done, had the lawsuit been filed earlier.&lt;ref name="danjaq"/&gt;
Unreasonable delay may also prejudice the rights of third-parties who were unknown in the case, earlier but whose rights got created in the intervening period of the delay (e.g.: the defendant inducts new persons on a disputed property by sale, or by lease)

==Procedure==
{{primary sources|section|date=January 2016}}
A defense lawyer raising the defense of ''laches'' against a motion for [[Injunction|injunctive relief]] (a form of equitable relief) might argue that the plaintiff comes "waltzing in at the eleventh hour" when it is now too late to grant the relief sought, at least not without causing great harm that the plaintiff could have avoided. In certain types of cases (for example, cases involving time-sensitive matters, such as elections), a delay of even a few days is likely to be met with a defense of ''laches'', even where the applicable [[statute of limitations]] might allow the type of action to be commenced within a much longer time period. In courts in the United States, laches has often been applied even where a statute of limitations exists, although there is a division of authority on this point.&lt;ref name="Little Bit of Laches" /&gt;

If a court does accept the laches defense, it can decide either to deny the request for equitable relief or to narrow the equitable relief that it would otherwise give. Even if the court denies equitable relief to a plaintiff because of laches, the plaintiff may still have a claim for legal relief if the statute of limitations has not run out.

Under the United States [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]], ''laches'' is an [[affirmative defense]], which means that the burden of asserting ''laches'' is on the party responding to the claim to which it applies.{{quote|"When the defense of laches is clear on the face of the complaint, and where it is clear that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts to avoid the insuperable bar, a court may consider the defense on a motion to dismiss."&lt;ref&gt;Solow v. Nine West Group, 2001 WL 736794, *3 (S.D.N.Y. June 29, 2001).{{primary source inline|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=January 2016}} &lt;ref&gt;Simons v.

The ''laches'' defense does not apply if the claimant was a [[Minor (law)|minor]] during the time that the claim was not brought, so a party can bring a claim against an historical injustice when they reach their majority.&lt;ref name=MajorityDefense&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=92046185&amp;pty=CAN&amp;eno=199|title=USPTO Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, Amanda Blackhorse, Marcus Briggs-Cloud, Philip Gover, Jillian Pappan, and Courtney Tsotigh v.

==Compared to statute of limitations==
The defense of ''laches'' resembles a [[statute of limitations]] since both are concerned with ensuring that plaintiffs bring their claims in a timely fashion.

However,  a statute of limitations is concerned only with the time that has passed. Laches is concerned with the reasonableness of the delay in a particular situation and so is more case-specific and more focused on the equitable conduct of the plaintiff. Those considerations are not unique to the laches defense because they are characteristic of equitable reasoning and equitable remedies.&lt;ref name="Little Bit of Laches" /&gt; Whereas, limitation is a statutory remedy.

In the US, the proper disposal of claims in light of those two areas of law has required attention through to the Supreme Court. In ''[[Petrella v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]'' (2014), the [[US Supreme Court]] rebuffed a defendant's claim that laches barred a copyright infringement suit because Congress had established a detailed statutory scheme, including a statute of limitations.&lt;ref name=Fisher&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fisher, Daniel | url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielfisher/2014/05/19/unusual-split-as-supreme-court-upholds-raging-bull-suit-vs-mgm/ | date = 2014  | title = Supreme Court Upholds 'Raging Bull' Suit vs. MGM | journal = [[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]] | format = online | issue = May 19, 2014 | access-date = 5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''liberal paradox''', also '''Sen paradox''' or '''Sen's paradox''', is a logical [[paradox]] discovered by [[Amartya Sen]] which purports to show that no social system can simultaneously
# be committed to a minimal sense of freedom,
# always result in a type of economic efficiency known as [[Pareto efficiency]], and
# be capable of functioning in any society whatsoever.&lt;ref name="SenJPE"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Amartya|last=Sen|title=The Impossibility of a Paretian Liberal|journal=Journal of Political Economy|year=1970|volume=78|pages=152–157|jstor=1829633|doi=10.1086/259614}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SenCCSW"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sen|first=Amartya|title=Collective Choice and Social Welfare|origyear=1970|year=1984|publisher=New Holland|isbn=978-0444851277}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SenRF"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sen|first=Amartya|title=Rationality and Freedom|year=2004|publisher= Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0674013513}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This paradox is contentious because it appears to contradict the [[classical liberal]] claim that markets are both [[Pareto efficient]] and respect [[Civil liberties|individual freedoms]].

The paradox is similar in many respects to [[Arrow's impossibility theorem]] and uses similar mathematical techniques.

==Pareto efficiency==
{{main|Pareto efficiency}}

===Definition===

A particular distribution of goods or outcome of any social process is regarded as ''Pareto efficient'' if there is no way to improve one or more people's situations without harming another. Put another way, an outcome is '''not''' Pareto efficient if there is a way to improve at least one person's situation without harming anyone else.

For example, suppose a mother has ten dollars which she intends to give to her two children Carlos and Shannon. Suppose the children each want only money, and they do not get jealous of one another. The following distributions are Pareto efficient:

{| class="wikitable"
! Carlos 
! Shannon
|-
| $5 
| $5
|-
| $10 
| $0
|-
| $2 
| $8
|}

But a distribution that gives each of them $2 and where the mother wastes the remaining $6 is not Pareto efficient, because she could have given the wasted money to either child and made that child better off without harming the other.

In this example, it was presumed that a child was made better or worse off by gaining or losing money, respectively, and that neither child gained or lost by evaluating her share in comparison to the other.  To be more precise, we must evaluate all possible [[utility|preferences]] that the child might have and consider a situation as Pareto efficient if there is no other social state that at least one person favors (or prefers) and no one disfavors.

===Use in economics===

Pareto efficiency is often used in economics as a minimal sense of [[economic efficiency]].  If a mechanism does not result in Pareto efficient outcomes, it is regarded as inefficient since there was another outcome which could have made some people better off without harming anyone else.

The view that [[Market (economics)|markets]] produce Pareto efficient outcomes is regarded as an important and central justification for [[capitalism]].  This result was established (with certain assumptions) in an area of study known as [[general equilibrium theory]], and is known as [[Fundamental theorems of welfare economics|the first fundamental theorem of welfare economics]]. As a result, these results often feature prominently in [[libertarian]] justifications of unregulated markets.

==Two examples==

=== Sen's original example ===

Sen's original example&lt;ref name="SenJPE" /&gt; used a simple society with only two people and only one social issue to consider.  The two members of society are named "Lewd" and "Prude".  In this society there is a copy of a ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'' and it must be given either to Lewd to read, to Prude to read, or disposed of unread.  Suppose that Lewd enjoys this sort of reading and would prefer to read it himself rather than have it disposed of.  However, he would get even more enjoyment out of Prude being forced to read it.

Prude thinks that the book is indecent and that it should be disposed of unread.  However, if someone must read it Prude would prefer that he, himself read it rather than Lewd since Prude thinks it would be even worse for someone to read and enjoy the book rather than read it in disgust.

Given these preferences of the two individuals in the society, a social planner must decide what to do.  Should the planner force Lewd to read the book, force Prude to read the book, or let it go unread?  More particularly, the social planner must rank all three possible outcomes in terms of their social desirability.  The social planner decides that she should be committed to individual rights, each individual should get to choose whether he, himself will read the book. Lewd should get to decide whether the outcome "Lewd reads" will be ranked higher than "No one reads", and similarly Prude should get to decide whether the outcome "Prude reads" will be ranked higher than "No one reads".

Following this strategy, the social planner declares that the outcome "Lewd reads" will be ranked higher than "No one reads" (because of Lewd's preferences) and that "No one reads" will be ranked higher than "Prude reads" (because of Prude's preferences).  Consistency then requires that "Lewd reads" be ranked higher than "Prude reads", and so the social planner gives the book to Lewd to read.

Notice that this outcome is regarded as worse than "Prude reads" by both Prude ''and'' Lewd, and the chosen outcome is therefore [[Pareto efficiency|Pareto inferior]] to another available outcome—the one where Prude is forced to read the book.

=== Gibbard's example ===

Another example was provided by philosopher [[Allan Gibbard]].&lt;ref name="Gibbard"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gibbard|first=Allan|title=A Pareto Consistent Libertarian Claim|journal=Journal of Economic Theory|year=1974|volume=7|pages=388–410 |doi=10.1016/0022-0531(74)90111-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suppose there are two individuals Alice and Bob who live next door to each other.  Alice loves the color blue and hates red.  Bob loves the color green and hates yellow.  If each were free to choose the color of their house independently of the other, they would choose their favorite colors.  But Alice hates Bob with a passion, and she would gladly endure a red house if it meant that Bob would have to endure his house being yellow.  Bob similarly hates Alice, and would gladly endure a yellow house if that meant that Alice would live in a red house.

If each individual is free to choose their own house color, independently of the other, Alice would choose a blue house and Bob would choose a green one.  But, this outcome is not Pareto efficient, because both Alice and Bob would prefer the outcome where Alice's house is red and Bob's is yellow.  As a result, giving each individual the freedom to choose their own house color has led to an inefficient outcome—one that is inferior to another outcome where neither is free to choose their own color.

Mathematically, we can represent Alice's preferences with this symbol: &lt;math&gt;\succ_A&lt;/math&gt; and Bob's preferences with this one: &lt;math&gt;\succ_B&lt;/math&gt;.  We can represent each outcome as a pair: (''Color of Alice's house'', ''Color of Bob's house'').  As stated Alice's preferences are:

:(Blue, Yellow) &lt;math&gt;\succ_A&lt;/math&gt; (Red, Yellow) &lt;math&gt;\succ_A&lt;/math&gt; (Blue, Green) &lt;math&gt;\succ_A&lt;/math&gt; (Red, Green)

And Bob's are:

:(Red, Green) &lt;math&gt;\succ_B&lt;/math&gt; (Red, Yellow) &lt;math&gt;\succ_B&lt;/math&gt; (Blue, Green) &lt;math&gt;\succ_B&lt;/math&gt; (Blue, Yellow)

If we allow free and independent choices of both parties we end up with the outcome (Blue, Green) which is dispreferred by both parties to the outcome (Red, Yellow) and is therefore not Pareto efficient.

==The theorem==
Suppose there is a society ''N'' consisting of two or more individuals and a set ''X'' of two or more social outcomes. (For example, in the Alice and Bob case, ''N'' consisted of Alice and Bob, and ''X'' consisted of the four color options ⟨Blue, Yellow⟩, ⟨Blue, Green⟩, ⟨Red, Yellow⟩, and ⟨Red, Green⟩.)

Suppose each individual in the society has a [[Total relation|total]] and [[transitive relation|transitive]] preference relation on the set of social outcomes ''X''. For notation, the preference relation of an individual ''i''∊''N'' is denoted by ≼&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. Each preference relation belongs to the set ''Rel(X)'' of all total and transitive relations on ''X''.

A social choice function is a map which can take any configuration of preference relations of ''N'' as input and produce a subset of ("chosen") social outcomes as output. Formally, a social choice function is a map

&lt;math&gt;F : {Rel}(X)^N \rightarrow \mathcal{P}(X)&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!--all possible combinations of preference relations for members of ''N''!--&gt;

from the set of functions between ''N''→''Rel(X)'', to the power set of ''X''. (Intuitively, the social choice function represents a societal principle for choosing one or more social outcomes based on individuals' preferences. By representing the social choice process as a ''function'' on ''Rel(X)''&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;, we are tacitly assuming that the social choice function is defined for any possible configuration of preference relations; this is sometimes called the Universal Domain assumption.)


The liberal paradox states that every social choice function satisfies ''at most one'' of the following properties, never both:

# '''Pareto optimality''': whenever all individuals of a society strictly prefer an outcome ''x'' over an outcome ''y'', the choice function doesn't pick ''y''. 
#* Formally, a social choice function ''F'' is Pareto optimal if whenever ''p''∊''Rel(X)''&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt; is a configuration of preference relations and there are two outcomes ''x'' and ''y'' such that  ''x''⪲&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;''y'' for every individual ''i''∊''N'', then ''y''∉ ''F(p)''.
# '''Minimal liberalism''': More than one individual in the society is '''decisive''' on a pair of social outcomes. (An individual is decisive on a pair of social outcomes ''x'' and ''y'' if, whenever he prefers ''x'' over ''y'', the social choice function prefers ''x'' over ''y'' regardless of what other members of the society prefer. And similarly whenever he prefers ''y'' over ''x'', the social choice function prefers ''y'' over ''x''.)
#* Formally, a social choice function ''F'' respects minimal liberalism if there is more than one individual ''i''∊''N'' for which there exists a pair of outcomes ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; on which he is decisive—that is, for every configuration of preference relations  ''p''∊''Rel(X)''&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;∊ ''F(p)'' only when ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;≼&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;''y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; (and similarly, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;∊ ''F(p)'' only when ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;≼&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;).
#* As an example of decisiveness: in the Lewd/Prude case, Lewd was decisive on the pair of outcomes ⟨"Lewd reads", "No one reads"⟩ and Prude was decisive on the pair of outcomes ⟨"Prude reads", "No one reads"⟩.

In other words, the liberal paradox states that for every social choice function ''F'', there is a configuration of preference relations ''p''∊''Rel(X)''&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt; for which ''F'' violates either Pareto optimality or Minimal liberalism (or both). In the examples of Sen and Gibbard noted above, the social choice function satisfies minimal liberalism at the expense of Pareto optimality.

==Ways out of the paradox==

Because the paradox relies on very few conditions, there are a limited number of ways to escape the paradox.  Essentially one must either reject the ''universal domain'' assumption, the ''Pareto principle'', or the ''minimal liberalism principle.''  Sen himself suggested two ways out, one a rejection of universal domain another a rejection of the Pareto principle.

=== Universal domain ===

Julian Blau proves that Sen's paradox can only arise when individuals have "nosy" preferences—that is when their preference depends not only on their own action but also on others' actions.&lt;ref name="Blau"&gt;{{cite book|last=Blau|first=Julian|title=Liberal Values and Independence|journal=The Review of Economic Studies|year=1975|volume=42|number=3|pages=395–401 |doi=10.2307/2296852 |jstor=2296852}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the example of Alice and Bob above, Alice has a preference over how Bob paints his house, and Bob has a preference over Alice's house color as well.

Most arguments which demonstrate market efficiency assume that individuals care about only their own consumption and not others' consumption and therefore do not consider the situations that give rise to Sen's paradox.  In fact, this shows a strong relationship between Sen's paradox and the well known result that [[Market failure|markets fail]] to produce Pareto outcomes in the presence of [[externalities]].&lt;ref name= "Laffont"&gt;[[Jean-Jacques Laffont|Laffont, J. J.]] (2008). "externalities," ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', 2nd Ed. [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_E000200&amp;q=externality&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=9 Abstract.]&lt;/ref&gt; Externalities arise when the choices of one party affect another.  Classic examples of externalities include [[pollution]] or [[over fishing]]. Because of their nosy preferences, Alice's choice imposes a negative externality on Bob and vice versa.

To prevent the paradox, Sen suggests that "The ultimate guarantee for individual liberty may rest not on rules for social choice but on developing individual values that respect each other's personal choices."&lt;ref name="SenJPE" /&gt; Doing so would amount to limiting certain types of nosy preferences, or alternatively restricting the application of the Pareto principle only to those situations where individuals fail to have nosy preferences.

Note that if we consider the case of cardinal preferences—for instance, if Alice and Bob both had to state, within certain bounds, how much happiness they would get for each color of each house separately, and the situation which produced the most happiness were chosen—a minimally-liberal solution does not require that they have no nosiness at all, but just that the sum of all "nosy" preferences about one house's color are below some threshold, while the "non-nosy" preferences are all above that threshold. Since there are generally some questions for which this will be true—Sen's classic example is an individual's choice of whether to sleep on their back or their side—the goal of combining minimal liberalism with Pareto efficiency, while impossible to guarantee in all theoretical cases, may not in practice be impossible to obtain.

=== Pareto ===

Alternatively, one could remain committed to the universality of the rules for social choice and to individual rights and instead reject the universal application of the Pareto principle.  Sen also hints that this should be how one escapes the paradox: 
{{quote|What is the moral?  It is that in a very basic sense liberal values conflict with the Pareto principle. If someone takes the Pareto principle seriously, as economists seem to do, then he has to face problems of consistency in cherishing liberal values, even very mild ones.  Or, to look at it in another way, if someone does have certain liberal values, then he may have to eschew his adherence to Pareto optimality. While the Pareto criterion has been thought to be an expression of individual liberty, it appears that in choices involving more than two alternatives it can have consequences that are, in fact, deeply illiberal.&lt;ref name="SenJPE" /&gt;}}

=== Minimal liberalism ===

Most commentators on Sen's paradox have argued that Sen's minimal liberalism condition does not adequately capture the notion of individual rights.&lt;ref name="Gibbard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nozick"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nozick|first=Robert|year=1974|title=Anarchy, State, and Utopia|publisher=Basic books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gardenfors"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gärdenfors|first=Peter|year=1981|title=Rights, games and social choice|journal=Nous|volume=15|number=3|pages=341–356 |jstor=2215437|doi=10.2307/2215437 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sugden"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sugden|first=Robert|year=1985|title=Why be consistent? A critical analysis of consistency requirements in choice theory|journal=Economica|volume=52|number=206|pages=167–183 |jstor=2554418|doi=10.2307/2554418 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially what is excluded from Sen's characterization of individual rights is the ability to voluntarily form contracts that lay down one's claim to a right.

For example, in the example of Lewd and Prude, although each has a right to refuse to read the book, Prude would voluntarily sign a contract with Lewd promising to read the book on condition that Lewd refrain from doing so.  In such a circumstance there was no violation of Prude's or Lewd's rights because each entered the contract willingly.  Similarly, Alice and Bob might sign a contract to each paint their houses their dispreferred color on condition that the other does the same.

In this vein, Gibbard provides a weaker version of the minimal liberalism claim which he argues is consistent with the possibility of contracts and which is also consistent with the Pareto principle given any possible preferences of the individuals.&lt;ref name="Gibbard" /&gt;

=== Dynamism ===

Alternatively, instead of both Lewd and Prude deciding what to do at the same time, they should do it one after the other. If Prude decides not to read, then Lewd will decide to read, same outcome. However, if Prude decides to read, Lewd won't. "Prude reads" is preferred by Prude (and also Lewd) than "Lewd reads", so he will decide to read (with no obligation, voluntarily) to get this Pareto Efficient outcome. Marc Masat hints that this should be another way out of the paradox: 

{{quote|If there's, at least, one player without dominant strategy, the game will be played sequentially where players with dominant strategy and need to change it (if they are in the Pareto optimal they don't have to) will be the firsts to choose, allowing to reach the Pareto Efficiency without dictatorship nor restricted domain and also avoiding contract's costs such as time, money or other people. If all players present a dominant strategy, contracts may be used.&lt;ref name="Masat"&gt;{{cite paper|last=Masat|first=Marc|year=2014|title=Did you save room for dessert? A new interpretation of Liberal paradox|url=http://ddd.uab.cat/record/119393}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2284">'''Moderate realism''' (also called '''immanent realism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;) is a position in the debate on the [[metaphysics]] of [[universal (metaphysics)|universals]] that holds that there is no [[Third Realm (Frege)|realm]] in which universals exist (in opposition to [[Platonic realism]] who asserts the existence of [[abstract objects]]), nor do they really exist within [[particular]]s ''as universals'', but rather universals really exist within particulars ''as particularised'', and multiplied.

==Overview&lt;!--'Exaggerated realism' redirects here--&gt;==
Moderate realism is opposed to both '''exaggerated realism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (such as the theory of [[Platonic form]]s) and [[nominalism]]. Nominalists deny the existence of universals altogether, even as particularised and multiplied within particulars.

[[Aristotle]] espoused a form of moderate realism as did [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Bonaventure]], and [[Duns Scotus]] (cf. [[Scotist realism]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Nominalism, Realism, Conceptualism|Nominalism, Realism, Conceptualism – ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' (1913)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Moderate realism is [[anti-realist]] about [[abstract objects]], just like [[conceptualism]] is (their difference being that conceptualism denies the mind-independence of universals, while moderate realism does not).&lt;ref&gt;Neil A. Manson, Robert W. Barnard (eds.), ''The Bloomsbury Companion to Metaphysics'', Bloomsbury, 2014, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

A more recent and influential version of immanent realism has been advanced by [[Willard Van Orman Quine]], in works such as "Posits and Reality" (1955),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/sci-real/#H4 Scientific Realism and Antirealism – Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[D. M. Armstrong]], in works such as his ''Universals: An Opinionated Introduction'' (1989, p. 8).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5371">{{for|bound variables in mathematics|free variables and bound variables}}
In [[programming language]]s, '''name binding''' is the association of entities (data and/or code) with [[identifier]]s.&lt;ref name=tkac08&gt;{{Citation |title=Using early binding and late binding in Automation |author=Microsoft |url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/245115 |publisher=Microsoft |date=May 11, 2007 |accessdate=May 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; An identifier bound to an object is said to [[Reference (computer science)|reference]] that object. [[Machine language]]s have no built-in notion of identifiers, but name-object bindings as a service and notation for the programmer is implemented by programming languages. Binding is intimately connected with [[scoping]], as scope determines which names bind to which objects – at which locations in the program code ([[Scope (computer science)#Lexical_scoping|lexically]]) and in which one of the possible execution paths ([[Scope (computer science)#Dynamic_scoping|temporally]]).

Use of an identifier &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; in a context that establishes a binding for &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; is called a binding (or
defining) occurrence. In all other occurrences (e.g., in expressions, assignments, and subprogram calls), an identifier stands for what it is bound to; such occurrences are called applied occurrences.

==Binding time==
* ''Static binding'' (or ''early binding'') is name binding performed before the program is run &lt;ref name=ieee24765:2010(E)&gt;{{Citation |title=Systems and software engineering — Vocabulary ISO/IEC/IEEE 24765:2010(E)|publisher=IEEE |date=Dec 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
* ''Dynamic binding'' (or ''late binding'' or ''virtual binding'') is name binding performed as the program is running &lt;ref name=ieee24765:2010(E) /&gt;.

An example of a static binding is a direct [[C (programming language)|C]] function call: the function referenced by the identifier cannot change at runtime.

But an example of dynamic binding is [[dynamic dispatch]], as in a [[C++]] virtual method call. Since the specific type of a [[Polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphic]] object is not known before runtime (in general), the executed function is dynamically bound. Take, for example, the following [[Java (programming language)|Java]] code:

 &lt;source lang="java"&gt;
 public void foo(java.util.List&lt;String&gt; list) {
     list.add("bar");
 }
 &lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt; is an [[interface (computing)|interface]], so &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt; must refer to a [[subtype]] of it. Is it a reference to a &lt;code&gt;LinkedList&lt;/code&gt;, an &lt;code&gt;ArrayList&lt;/code&gt;, or some other [[subtype]] of &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt;? The actual method referenced by &lt;code&gt;add&lt;/code&gt; is not known until runtime. In C, such an instance of dynamic binding may be a call to a function pointed to by a variable or expression of a function pointer type whose value is unknown until it actually gets evaluated at run-time.

==Rebinding and mutation==
Rebinding should not be confused with mutation.

* ''Rebinding'' is a change to the ''referencing'' identifier.
* ''Mutation'' is a change to the ''referenced'' entity.

Consider the following [[Java (programming language)|Java]] code:

 &lt;source lang="java"&gt;
 LinkedList&lt;String&gt; list;
 list = new LinkedList&lt;String&gt;();
 list.add("foo");
 list = null;
 &lt;/source&gt;

The identifier &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt; initially references nothing (it is [[uninitialized variable|uninitialized]]); it is then rebound to reference an object (a linked list of strings). The linked list referenced by &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt; is then mutated, adding a string to the list. Lastly, &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt; is rebound to &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;.

==Late static==
Late static binding is a variant of binding somewhere between static and dynamic binding.  Consider the following [[PHP]] example:
&lt;source lang="php"&gt;
class A {
    static $word = "hello";
    static function hello() { print self::$word; }
}

class B extends A {
    static $word = "bye";
}

B::hello();
&lt;/source&gt;

In this example, the PHP interpreter binds the keyword &lt;code&gt;self&lt;/code&gt; inside &lt;code&gt;A::hello()&lt;/code&gt; to class &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;, and so the call to &lt;code&gt;B::hello()&lt;/code&gt; produces the string "hello". If the semantics of &lt;code&gt;self::$word&lt;/code&gt; had been based on late static binding, then the result would have been "bye".

Beginning with PHP version 5.3, late static binding is supported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://us2.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.late-static-bindings.php|title=Late Static Bindings|accessdate=July 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically, if &lt;code&gt;self::$word&lt;/code&gt; in the above were changed to &lt;code&gt;static::$word&lt;/code&gt; as shown in the following block, where the keyword &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt; would only be bound at runtime, then the result of the call to &lt;code&gt;B::hello()&lt;/code&gt; would be "bye":

&lt;source lang="php"&gt;
class A {
    static $word = "hello";
    static function hello() { print static::$word; }
}

class B extends A {
    static $word = "bye";
}

B::hello();
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Paul Mattick Jr.''' (born 1944) is a [[Marxist]] theorist and philosopher.

He is the son of [[council communist]] theoreticians [[Paul Mattick|Paul Mattick Sr.]] (1904-1981) and Ilse Mattick (1919-2009).

Mattick was involved in the council communist group Root and Branch, which sporadically published a magazine/pamphlet series, starting in 1969. Other notable members include [[Jeremy Brecher]], [[Stanley Aronowitz]], and [[Peter Rachleff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Root and Branch Archive |url=//www.labor.iu.edu/LaborHistory/rab/home.html |accessdate=11 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041028192535/http://www.labor.iu.edu/LaborHistory/rab/home.html |archivedate=October 28, 2004 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Root and Branch"&gt;{{cite book |last=Root and Branch|first=Ed.|title=Root and Branch: The Rise of the Workers' Movements|year=1975|publisher=Fawcett Publications |location=Greenwich, Conn.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mattick obtained his [[PhD]] from [[Harvard]] in 1981. He was previously the editor of the ''International Journal of Political Economy'', and is the author of several books on [[philosophy of language]], [[aesthetics]], and the [[critique of political economy]].

'''Philosophy of Architecture''' is a branch of [[philosophy of art]], dealing with aesthetic value of [[architecture]], its [[semantics]] and relations with development of [[culture]].

==History ==

=== Early history ===

[[Plato]], whose influence on architecture is widely documented (e.g., 'idealism', 'neo-Platonic' architecture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hendrix | first=John Shannon | authorlink=John Shannon Hendrix | date=1999 | title=Neoplatonic Philosophy and Roman Baroque Architecture | journal=The European Studies Journal | publisher=University of Northern Iowa | volume=16 | issue=1 |pages=31–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;), may be counted as part of a classical geometric model of cosmology, the popularity of which could be attributed to earlier thinkers such as [[Pythagoras]]. In early history, philosophers distinguished architecture ('technion') from building ('demiorgos'), attributing the former to mental traits, and the latter to the divine or natural. It was only with Socratic irony that the name craftsman could become representative of a religious deity. The presence of some degree of formalism ala Platonism continues to be an important trait in distinguishing one architectural style from another, and thus in distinguishing the philosophy of a style.

Due to the nature of critique, the philosophy of architecture is an outgrowth of the [[philosophy of art]], which began to be expressed in books on architecture and history of architecture during the latter half of the twentieth century.&lt;ref name="Harries p. 29"&gt;{{ cite journal | author=Harries K. | title= Philosophy and the Task of Architecture | journal=Journal of Architectural Education | volume=40 | issue=2 | date=Winter 1987 | pages=29 | doi=10.2307/1424928}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to that, largely because of its reliance on technology and engineering, architecture was seen as incompatible, or beneath, the proper subject areas of classical aesthetics as delimited by, notably, [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten]], with their ideal of "pure art."&lt;ref name="Harries p. 29" /&gt;

=== Modern period ===

[[File:Panopticon.jpg|thumb | Panopticon. Drawing by [[Jeremy Bentham]] in 1791.]]
As it was noted by [[Michel Foucault]], the architecture is able to set the life of society, and therefore it is particularly important for understanding of the person's values and culture. In "[[Discipline and Punish]]" Foucault analized contemporary culture through architecture project of principally new prison [[Panopticon]]. The point of this project by [[Jeremy Bentham]] was to create a special transparent environment for prisoners, where everyone would be under constant surveillance. Although the project was not realized, Bentham's thought deeply influenced ideology of prisons, changing social practices of punishment. Simultaneously with its main conclusions Foucault reached other goal - his instrumental use of architecture in cultural studies showed the potential of this philosophical theme.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

However, philosophy of architecture as a full-fledged part of the Philosophy of Art, would not have been possible without the [[Avant-garde]]`s shift of the aesthetic paradigm. Art, set in the conditions of [[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction|mechanical reproduction of the image]], was forced to look for new ways. Around the same time architectural styles of [[Constructivist architecture|Constructivism]] and [[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionalism]] find way to justify new, totally engineering aesthetics. Side of the architecture, which had been considered a shame (as a sign of its connection with the pragmatic needs of man and society), became a major advantage, central part of new system of aesthetic values. [[Cubism]] and [[Futurism]] set aesthetic, full of mechanized, slaughtered, brutal forms, what was very close to the same engineering ideal. All this created more than favorable environment to change status of architecture in our system of art, as well as our understanding of art by itself.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

=== Postmodernism ===
[[File:Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village crop.jpg| thumb | 450pks | Photography "[[Stuyvesant Town - Peter Cooper Village]]," according to Martin R.&lt;ref name="Martin R."&gt;Martin R. "Architecture's Image Problem. Have We Ever Been Postmodern." ''Grey Room,'' No. 22 (Winter, 2006), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; it is an architectural work, which may serve as one of the first manifestations of postmodernism]]
Architecture assumed much more significant role after establishing of the phenomenon of [[Postmodernism]]. According to R. Martin "it remains surprising how many influential accounts of cultural postmodernism make reference to architecture."&lt;ref name="Martin R." /&gt;
Some scholars go so far as to claim that the entire post-modernism comes from the practice of architecture, and the rejection of "[[Art Nouveau|style of Modern]]" as an architectural style, and by so architects terminologically formulated postmodernism. Thus, F. Jameson writes that "it is in the realm of architecture, however, that modifications in aesthetic production are most dramatically visible, and that their theoretical problems have been most centrally raised and articulated (...) it was indeed from architectural debates that my own conception of post-modernism (...) initially began to emerge."&lt;ref&gt;Jameson F. Postmodernism, or, The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism. 2003. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; As it was noted by researchers, "Barthes and Eco, taking their cue from Russian Formalism, see norm breaking as the mark of the aesthetic (sc., the aesthetic code). Art is characteristically inventive in its capacity to have signs do duty as signifier of further meanings in a potentially endless play upon convention as well as within it or on its margin."&lt;ref name="Donougho M 1987 p. 65"&gt;Donougho M. The Language of Architecture // Journal of Aesthetic Education, Vol. 21, No. 3 (Autumn, 1987), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; So important to postmodern writers like [[Barthes, Roland|R. Bart]] and [[Eco, Umberto|U. Eco]], saw architecture as a source of revolutionary innovations in art.&lt;ref name="Donougho M 1987 p. 65"/&gt;
[[File:The Luxor From Airport.jpg| thumb | 450pks | Photo of casino "Luxor", an example of architecture of "Las Vegas", which formed the basis for post-modernist manifesto of [[Robert Venturi]] and has played a key role in the development of post-modernism according to F. Jameson]]F. Jameson believes that there is a special relationship between postmodernism and American architecture, in which the birth of a national architecture coincided, in his opinion, with the emergence of the terminology or even the reality of postmodernism.&lt;ref&gt;Jameson F. Postmodernism, or, The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism. 2003. p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all researchers agree with his post-modern "architectural origins," so [[Andreas Huyssen]], suggests that the conceptual frame of postmodernism has been defined within certain movements of literature. However, this researcher also notes the special role of architecture in the development of post-modernism. Martin describes, that "Huyssen credits architecture with helping to disseminate the term postmodernism, originally from literature, into the expanded aesthetic sphere during the 1970s."&lt;ref name="Martin R." /&gt; [[Jean-François Lyotard|Lyotard]] contends that postmodern architects have nothing in common with true Postmodernism &lt;ref name="Martin R." /&gt; and, as Lyotard states it in his article, ''Answering the Question: What Is Postmodernism?'': "under the name of postmodernism, architects are getting rid of the Bauhaus project, throwing out the baby of experimentation with the bathwater of functionalism."&lt;ref&gt;Lyotard J.-F. Answering the Question: What Is Postmodernism? // Lyotard J.-F. The Posmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge. 1984. p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

A special figure for the philosophy of architecture can be considered the architect [[Robert Venturi]], whose books may have played a no lesser role in the development of [[postmodernism]], than his stylistic experiments in architecture. R. Venturi first lead attention of architects to [[pop-art]]. In his rejection of architectural modernism Venturi  gave rise to the new cultural setting. By this Venturi showed a deep connection between civilization and architectural forms.&lt;ref&gt;Martin R. Architecture's Image Problem. Have We Ever Been Postmodern // Grey Room, No. 22 (Winter, 2006), pp. 9-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wittgenstein and philosophy of architecture ==
[[File:Wittgenstein haus.jpg|thumb|300px|A photo of Wittgenstein House]]
The [[Wittgenstein House]] is considered one of the most important examples of interactions between philosophy and architecture. Built by renowned [[Austria]]n philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], the house has been the subject of extensive research about the relationship between its stylistic features, Wittgenstein's personality, and his philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Himmelfarb G. "Jeremy Bentham’s Haunted House." Victorian Minds. (Knopf, 1968).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tilghman B.R. "Ludwig Wittgenstein, Architect." Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism.

'''Problem-oriented policing (POP)''', coined by [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] professor [[Herman Goldstein]], is a policing strategy that involves the identification and analysis of specific [[crime]] and [[Civil disorder|disorder]] problems, in order to develop effective response strategies. For years{{when|date=December 2014}}, police focused on the “means” of policing rather than its “ends”, according to Goldstein. Goldstein (1979) called to replace what he termed the reactive, incident-driven “standard model of policing”.&lt;ref&gt;(Weisburd 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; This approach requires police to be proactive in identifying underlying problems which can be targeted to reduce crime and disorder at their roots. Goldstein’s view emphasized a [[paradigm shift]] in [[criminal law]], but also in civil statutes and the use of municipal and community resources. Goldstein’s 1979 model was expanded in 1987 by John E. Eck and William Spelman into the SARA model for problem solving.&lt;ref name="what"&gt;[http://www.popcenter.org/about-whatisPOP.htm Center for Problem Oriented Policing] - What is POP?&lt;/ref&gt;

This strategy places more emphasis on [[research]] and analysis as well as [[crime prevention]] and the engagement of public and private [[organization]]s in the reduction of community problems. 
&lt;ref name="what"/&gt;

== Introduction ==

Problem-oriented policing relies on the identification of problems by rank-and-file officers.  Not all departments will define problems the same way, but a typical definition is:
* Repeated incidents;
* Occurring in a [[community]];
* With related characteristics (e.g., behavior, location, people, time);
* That concern both the community and the [[police]].
Key concepts Goldstein argued that one must tackle the causes of the problem. Eck and Spelman developed a twelve-step model of what problem-oriented policing agency should do:
# Focus on problems of concern to the public.
# Zero in on effectiveness as the primary concern.
# Be proactive.
# Be committed to systematic inquiry as a first step in solving substantive problems.
# Encourage the use of rigorous methods in making inquiries,
# Make full use of the data in police files and the experience of police personnel.
# Group like incidents together so that they can be addressed as a common problem.
# Avoid using overly broad labels in grouping incidents so separate problems can be identified.
# Encourage a broad and uninhibited search for solutions.
# Acknowledge the limits of the criminal justice system as a response to problems.
# Identify multiple interests in any one problem and weigh them when analyzing the value of different responses.
# Be committed to taking some risks in responding to problems.&lt;ref name="Kerner 2003"&gt;(Kerner 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;
Where, under a traditional system, a patrol officer might answer repeated calls to a certain problem area or "hot spot" and deal only with each individual incident, that officer is encouraged under POP to discover the root cause of the problem and come up with ways of solving it. The goal is to find a cure for the ailment instead of merely treating the symptoms. Some{{Who|date=February 2013}} might confuse community-oriented policing with problem-oriented policing, but the main focus of community-oriented policing is the improvement of the relationship between law enforcement and the citizens, while problem-oriented policing is depending on information of the citizens and a good relationship with the community.&lt;ref name="Kerner 2003"/&gt;

The exploration of possible responses to a problem is handled by patrol officers. Once a problem is identified, officers are expected to work closely with community members to develop a solution, which can include a wide range of alternatives to arrest. Problem-oriented policing gives law enforcement a model for addressing the conditions that created and caused other problems of concern to the community. Communities must ensure law enforcement are addressing and responding to concerns of citizens. Problem-oriented policing is predicated on community involvement and support is key if law enforcement hopes to rectify crime. In SARA, “Scanning” is the first step and require police identifying and prioritizing potential problems in their jurisdiction. Second, the acronym “A” stands for analysis, for example analyzing the time of day when incidents occur, determining who the offenders are and why they prefer the park and investigate the particular areas of the park that are most conducive to the activity. In addition, evaluating their environmental design characteristics. Analysis also involves the police to use data sources, so the proper responses can be manifested. The third step, response, has the police develop and implement interventions designed to rectify the problems. The final step is assessment, which involves evaluating the impact of the response and what good has been accomplished.

These may focus on the offender, the community, the environment, outside agencies, or the need for some kind of [[mediation]].  Situations often demand that police and citizens fashion tailor-made responses to problems, so a high degree of importance is placed on creativity and discretion.

== Political issues and conflicts between actors ==

Successes in problem solving are well documented in study after study. One anthology by Ronald Glensor, Mark Correia and Kenneth Peak suggest it represents a "new policing". However, it is a new policing with varying degrees of success (Policing Communities: Understanding Crime and Solving Problems, Roxbury Publishing, 2000, page 1). This success has led to the problem-oriented approach being popular among police administrators and high-ranking city officials. Other factors affecting this preference is that public favor translates into job security for administrators and elected officials and that it gives the opportunity to collect substantial sums of money through federal grants.  In 1995, a federal grant of $327 million from the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] was divided up among police departments implementing POP programs in the state of [[Arizona]].  The availability of federal grant money creates a real incentive for police agencies to use POP. Federal agencies and national policing groups, the creation of national awards for effective problem-oriented policing programs and implementation throughout the world. The U.S federal agency, the office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) adopted key strategy, and funding for POP (www.popcenter.org).

Because POP policy may require considerable organizational restructuring, administrators can justify applications for inordinately large funds.

Some rank-and-file officers, however, often do not share their administrators' enthusiasm{{Verify source|date=June 2009}}.  One of the reasons for this may be a lack of clarity with respect to organizational goals. Policing has from the beginning had a lack of clarity of organizational goals, and the introduction of POP does not always solve the problem. Consequently, rank and file officers assuming this lack of clarity concern will be resolved by POP and are disappointed when that is not done. Poorly defined or ambiguous goals can lead to stress and frustration.  Another possible source of rank-and-file discontent is militant police unionism in which union leadership sees POP as an expansion of police duties and attempts to include these duties into collective bargaining.

A further source of frustration by some officers is the conflict between the administration's community policing mandate and the continuing need to respond to calls for service{{Verify source|date=June 2009}}.

== Significant impacts of POP policy ==

Problem-oriented policing often has a number of effects and some [[unintended consequence]]s that flow from them{{Verify source|date=June 2009}}.
==Criticism==
The majority of problem-oriented policing projects fail to investigate displacement. Law enforcement is generally satisfied to achieve a crime reduction in the targeted area and may be less concerned if crime is displaced outside their jurisdiction. However assessing and understanding potential displacement effects can help ensure the effectiveness of your problem-oriented policing. However determining the extent of displacement will also assist in defending your results to critics. According to the [[Center for Problem-Oriented Policing]], “Crime displacement is the relocation of crime from one place, time target offense, or tactic to another as a result of some prevention initiative”(Defining 2012). In addition, displacement is viewed as a negative consequence of crime prevention efforts, however, it can provide benefits. However, if a community has no trust in law enforcement, then situations like the above case studies will take place. Law enforcement and the community will have friction. As difficult as it often is for police officers to obtain "buy-in" within. It is often even more difficult to convince people outside
the police department to carry out specific tasks faithfully and properly without a negative inference of its inadequacy in satisfying the expectations of the masses (Scott n.d).

=== Success in resolving crime and other community problems ===

Among the most dramatic impacts of POP is that it works. POP successes are robust and are demonstrated in studies and publications over two decades.

One example of these success stories is the hundreds of POP projects submitted to the Herman Goldstein Problem-Solving Award program each year at the International POP Conference (www.popcenter.org). The projects illustrate that police departments across the world have been implementing POP measures onto a wide range of issues from car theft and school bullying to homicide and gang problems. The projects demonstrate the wide acceptance of the method as a way to reduce significant problems.

Another example of these successes are the numerous publications documenting success over the decades. Examples include Kenneth Peak and Ronald Glensor's text "Community Policing and Problem Solving: Strategies and Practices" (Prentice Hall, 1996) and Corina Sole Brito and Tracy Allan's "Problem Oriented Policing: Crime-Specific Problems, Critical Issues, Making POP Work - Volume 2" (Police Executive Research Forum, 1999).

=== Increased communication with the public ===

Under POP, the public has a much more direct hand in defining the goals of the police and influencing what issues the police will focus on.  On one hand it is possible that this can cause a conflict between what is traditionally of high importance to the police, such as robberies, burglaries and violent crime, and what is a priority to community members – which may be things as mundane as loitering crowds or acts of [[graffiti]]{{Verify source|date=June 2009}}.

This mismatch of priorities can hinder the relationship between the police and the community.  It can also make the officer’s job more difficult and stressful as he or she is presented with conflicting mandates, one set coming from within and the other from without (the community){{Verify source|date=June 2009}}.

On the other hand, actual experience in POP illustrates how POP projects also focuses on those very same crime concerns of importance to police. One example is the gangs and gun homicide reduction project reported by Anthony Bragga, David Kennedy, Anne Piehl and Elin Waring is their evaluation study "The Boston Gun Project's Operation  Ceasefire - Measuring the Impact of Operation Ceasefire" (National Institute of Justice, 2001).

Case Study 1	
	The SARA model can be very effective, but criminals tend to adapt and find some other form to operate crime. For example, for generations, a fairly small six-block area called The Village of Hempstead, New York has become a nightmare for most residence calling it “Terror Avenue,” because of all the murders and crime that have developed on that street. This community was plagued with open-air drug markets. Hempstead was the largest number of returning probationers and parolees in Nassau County. For more than 30 years, the six block radius in Hempstead has been the County’s crime hot spot and predicated itself to open-air drug market. With 6,000 residents and dense apartment buildings with over 800 units, had some of the highest Uniform Crime Report numbers, community complaints, unemployment and school dropouts in Nassau County (Reiss 2008).
	They used this unique strategy called the ‘High Point’ model which identified and formulated cases on major drug dealers and their drug market. To prevent reproduction from reoccurring  they went to community leaders and hosted meetings to inform the public on the idea of transforming ‘Terror Avenue.’ The use of confidential informants made drug buys, but dealers were not arrested, instead, they were videotaped. The investigation and analysis gathered showed about fifty individuals were major drug dealers in this open drug market. Law enforcement finally gained the public's trust once they found out through community meetings that the District Attorney and Law enforcement personnel wanted to help and not just lock away their loved ones. Non-violent dealers were invited to a community intervention where family and community leaders voiced their intolerance for dealing drugs.in the year 2005-2007, 44 percent of the narcotics and 169 major crimes were reported in the six-block area of Terrace-Bedell. The open air drug market manifested prostitution, auto thefts, robberies, loitering, murders, and traffic.
	First the scanning, in this case, was the open drug market that plagued the community with crime. The Analysis is mapping out data to determine the focus of the area collected was indeed Terrace-Bedell street corner. The response is use suppression by gathering with local community leaders, local residents, informants. The findings were about fifty drug dealers were the ones creating the open drug market. Eighteen nonviolent drug offenders were invited to attend the “gathering” (meeting). The Assessment resulted in crime reduction, trust in the police department and more intervention and adult interdiction programs.  Another possible conflict may exist between the proactive implementation of POP and the need for traditional “incident-driven” policing.  In large metropolitan areas, dispatchers receive a high volume of 911 emergencies and calls for service around the clock.  Some areas of the city may be quieter than others, and these are typically the areas that don’t have many problems.

Case study 2	Another case study that used SARA for tackling hot spots and crime using Mutualism is Mobile County. For example, in Mobile County in the state of Alabama, methamphetamine was on the rise. Mobile Counties narcotics unit seized 29 pounds 12 ounces of methamphetamine and more than 1 gallon of methamphetamine (Bettner n.d). The investigators used traditional drug enforcement techniques but were unsuccessful. The second approach was the availability and precursors needed to manufacture Methamphetamine. For example, the MCSO Narcotics Unit concentrated on state laws such as (20-2-190) that focused and managed reporting/tracking requirements on medication containing Pseudophedrine as a precursor.
	When discussing Mutualism, the main component that facilitates Meth enterprises is the chemical. Mobile Counties Narcotics focused on Pseudoephedrine sales of 88 pharmacies located in Mobile County and 47 pharmacies located in Baldwin County. In addition, MCSO focused on 135 pharmacies located in Mobile and Baldwin County, they identified 435 non-pharmacy type stores who were licensed by the Alabama ABC Board to sale Pseudoephedrine products (Bettner n.d). Profoundly with diligent compliance and enforcement initiatives by the MCSO of the non-pharmacy type stores was reduced to 50 non-pharmacy type stores by 2009. According to Marcus Felson author of Crime and Nature “obligate mutualisms are essential for survival. Apples are in trouble without honeybees” (Felson 2006). Using SARA or obligate mutualism can be assessed by Taking away the main ingredient that creates theobligatee mutualism between the operator and cook, which serves as a deterrent for meth labs and drug manufacturing.
	According to the Department of Justice Clandestine methamphetamine labs cause three main types of harm: (1) physical injury from explosions, fires, chemical burns, and toxic fumes; (2) environmental hazards; and (3) child endangerment (Scott 2006). The offenders in operations were tricky because the majority of laboratory owners set up the labs in their own premises, a family member, or co-offender in to have better access for manufacturing purposes (Chiu 2011). The offender would storage equipment in a families members name who was law abiding. Most of the equipment was quite easy to purchase and storage. For example, “glassware was found in bedrooms, kitchens, sheds, and cupboards or chemical precursors stockpiled in drawers” (Bettner n.d.). Cooking the product was done by either experienced or non-experienced cooks. For example, in some of the more strategic offender foraging, chemistry experts were brought in to help in with the cooking process. This part of the process is very crucial because lots of money is being invested into each batch. For example, it was estimated one patch cost $70,000 and can be turned for $200,000 to $400,000. Profits of the offender's transcripts and bank statements indicated where the monies would go and how much was due to each offender. The initial stages of the illegal manufacturing are dependent upon the legal enterprises such aaspharmacies, rental storage spaces and personal business (Chiu 2011). Law enforcement not only use suppression and data to target their problem, they use laws and ordinances. Statutes and ordinances are tools used for problem-oriented policing.

=== Relationships between officers ===

Complications can arise if police managers are unschooled in the proper implementation of POP strategies. For example, certain officers in each department are designated as community problem solvers or if a few enthusiastic officers earnestly commit themselves to the POP process, as this leaves the others on the same shift to pick up the slack in responding to calls for service.  This can lead to tension and resentment, which in turn can diminish morale and adversely affect the ability of the officers to function as a team and be productive{{Verify source|date=June 2009}}.

Of course the bigger question is "productive for what?". POP argues that traditionally police were productive in handing out tickets and making arrests. However, these tactics did not ensure crime decreased. In fact, numerous criminological studies showed they made no impact whatsoever on the greater sense of public safety as first reported in the famous study by George Kelling and others (The Kansas City Preventive Patrol Experiment, Police Foundation, 1974). POP creates specific goals in tackling tangible problems. Productivity is determined by resolving problems. If tickets and arrests help do that, they are employed. If they don't help that, then other more creative strategies are employed. Consequently, the actual reason tension and resentment arises is because officers are ill-trained in creative problem-solving and feel they do not get adequate supervision or time to do POP.

Contrary to the tension and resentment issue in some agencies, in other more successful agencies, proper implementation of POP is established so that sophisticated problem-solving is part of the promotional process and officers come to see involvement in POP as a career path to more advanced ranks.

=== Abuse of authority or heightened conservatism ===

Increased discretion creates a risk for [[abuses of authority]]. POP encourages police to actively intervene in situations they had previously left alone, which presents more opportunities for [[abuse]] and a “[[net-widening]]” effect, though there is little evidence{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} to suggest this is actually happening. The POP projects published to date (over 700 are listed in the POP library at www.popcenter.org) suggest{{according to whom|date=December 2014}} that in most cases officers collaborate with community members in selecting proper levels of discretion and choose problems they, and the public, want resolved.

Although there is no evidence to suggest it is actually happening, there is a possibility that increased discretion coupled with the possibility of larger social consequences could make officers more conservative in their approach; perhaps too conservative to fully achieve POP goals{{Verify source|date=June 2009}}.

In summary, POP represents one of the more lasting and successful components of the community policing movement. It has stood the test of time thus far and delivered a plethora of successful projects in resolving community crime and disorder. Michael Scott's 20-year retrospective concludes: "After 20 years, problem-oriented policing has demonstrated an internal logic that has been successfully applied at the project level, and remains a promising approach for the foreseeable future." (Michael Scott, Problem Oriented Policing: Reflections on the First 20 Years, U.S. Department of Justice, Washington, 2000. page 129).

In [[jurisprudence]], '''prosecutorial misconduct''' is "an illegal act or failing to act, on the part of a prosecutor, especially an attempt to sway the jury to wrongly convict a defendant or to impose a harsher than appropriate punishment."&lt;ref name=misconduct&gt;{{cite web|title=prosecutorial misconduct - Legal Definition|url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/prosecutorial-misconduct|website=Webster's New World Law Dictionary|publisher=LoveToKnow, Corp|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is similar to [[selective prosecution]]. Prosecutors are bound by a sets of rules which outline fair and dispassionate conduct.&lt;ref&gt;Bar Rules, Director of Public Prosecutions Guidelines and ''Criminal Procedure Act'' 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abuses of discretion==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2013}} 
Prosecutors are given discretion about how they conduct their business. However, while some practices are not illegal, they may be seen as unethical and/or abusive and in need of reform, particularly by defendants and criminal defense attorneys:

* Selective prosecution by race, income, political affiliation, etc.
* Capture of the [[grand jury]], misusing it as a tool for inquisitorial abuse, or excluding citizen complaints from being heard.
* [[Plea bargaining]] abuses, such as seeking testimony in exchange for leniency. This may solicit [[perjury]] or falsified evidence.
* “Horsetrading”, the practice of colluding with defense attorneys to agree to get some of their clients to plead guilty in exchange for letting others off.
* Threatening public officials, especially judges, with prosecution if they don't unduly support their cases.
* Tainting of jury pools with public statements by prosecutors that are either inaccurate, exaggerated, unsupported by evidence or that could be inadmissible at trial, and such statements become widely promulgated by the media.
* Prosecutors causing depositions in a related civil trial which were likely to yield [[exculpatory evidence]], and then "staying" those statements so they cannot be used in a criminal trial.
* Prosecutors naming a host of “un-indicted co-conspirators” in [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] cases to intimidate potential defense witnesses with threats of retaliatory prosecution.
* Prosecutors using their [[peremptory challenge|Peremptory Challenges]] to remove from the jury anyone with relevant experience in the complex subjects of a trial. Defense attorneys often use similar tactics. Both attempt to prevent a juror's technical knowledge from interfering with the credibility of their [[expert witness]]es.
* Prosecutors pursuing criminal penalties for selected industry practices in Corporate America when regulatory intervention would be more appropriate. For example, prosecuting a mechanic for minor violations of the [[Clean Water Act]] rather than affording the opportunity for the mechanic to correct their error and pay the appropriate fines.
* Prosecutors using multidefendant trials to get defendants to turn on one another in the courtroom, as judges may be reluctant to allow separate trials in multi-defendant cases.

In late 1993, the [[6th US Circuit Court of Appeals]] ruled that [[John Demjanjuk]] had been a victim of prosecutorial misconduct during a 1986 trial in which [[United States federal government|federal]] prosecutors withheld evidence. Demjanjuk's [[Sentence (law)|sentence]] was overturned, but he lost when his case was retried.

In the 1995 [[O. J. Simpson murder case|murder trial]] of [[O. J. Simpson]], the defense argued that [[Los Angeles Police Department]] [[detective]] [[Mark Fuhrman]] had planted [[evidence (law)|evidence]] at the [[crime scene]]. Although Fuhrman denied the allegations, Simpson was found [[acquittal|not guilty]], although he was later held liable for the deaths in a civil suit filed by the families of the victims. In ''[[USA Today]]'' (August 24, 1995), [[Francis Fukuyama]] stated, "[Such defenses lead to] a distrust of [[government]] and the belief that public authorities are in a vast [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy]] to violate the [[rights]] of individuals." However, such misconduct may actually be widespread in the United States. "It’s a result-oriented process today, fairness be damned," Robert Merkle, former [[U.S. Attorney]] for the [[United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida|Middle District of Florida]], said.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.post-gazette.com/win/day1_1a.asp&lt;/ref&gt; Prosecutors are protected from [[civil liability]] even when they knowingly and maliciously break the law in order to secure convictions, and the doctrine of [[harmless error]] can be used by appellate courts to uphold convictions despite such illegal tactics, which some argue gives prosecutors few incentives to comply with the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2003/07/12/Opinion/Policing_prosecutors.shtml|title=Opinion: Policing prosecutors|author=|date=12 July 2003|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more recent example of prosecutorial misconduct can be seen in the 2006 [[Duke lacrosse case]]. In that incident, members of the [[Duke Blue Devils men's lacrosse|Duke University men's lacrosse team]] hired a female [[stripper]] for a team party. She went on to accuse three players of [[rape|raping]] her at that party. Making the case even more volatile was the fact that the stripper was [[African American|black]] and the three accused players were [[White American|white]]. The actions of the prosecutor in this case, [[Mike Nifong]], drew enormous criticism, as he proceeded with the case despite numerous inconsistencies in the accuser's story, a lack of DNA evidence conclusively linking any player to any sexual assault, and at least two of the accused having solid alibis. He also made numerous inflammatory statements to the media. The case against the players eventually collapsed; all charges were dropped, and the [[North Carolina Attorney General]] took the unusual step of declaring the players innocent. The North Carolina State Bar eventually [[disbarment|disbarred]] Nifong for his actions during this case.

In 2011 a Texas man, [[Michael Morton (criminal justice)|Michael Morton]] was released from prison after serving nearly 25 years for the murder of his wife in 1987. He was released after DNA evidence pointed to another man as the killer.&lt;ref name=morton_murder&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lindell|first1=Chuck|title=Judge finds that Anderson hid evidence in Morton murder trial|url=http://www.statesman.com/news/news/local/ken-anderson-court-of-inquiry-resumes/nXRLm/|website=Austin Statesman|publisher=Cox Media Group|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecutor, [[Ken Anderson (Texas prosecutor)|Ken Anderson]] later plead guilty to withholding evidence that could have helped Morton fight the murder charge. He was sentenced to spend 10 days in jail and was also disbarred.&lt;ref name=tx_monthly&gt;{{cite web|last1=Colloff|first1=Pamela|title=Jail Time May Be the Least of Ken Anderson’s Problems|url=http://www.texasmonthly.com/story/jail-time-may-be-least-ken-anderson%E2%80%99s-problems|website=Texas Monthly|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite such, the defense has been successful in roughly 1 out of 6 times it has been used from 1970 to 2003.  During that period, judges have cited misconduct by prosecutors as a reason to dismiss charges, reverse convictions, or reduce sentences in 2,012 cases, according to a study by the [[Center for Public Integrity]] released in 2003; the researchers looked at 11,452 cases in which misconduct was alleged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Breaking the Rules | url = http://www.publicintegrity.org/2003/06/26/5517/breaking-rules | accessdate = October 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A debate persists over the meaning of the term. Prosecutors have asked judges to stop using the term to refer to an unintentional error, and to restrict its use to describe a breach of professional ethics.  [[E. Norman Veasey]], the chief justice of [[Delaware Supreme Court]], answered one such request in 2003 by noting the term's extensive use in rulings over the past 60 years. "We believe it would be confusing to change the terminology in view of this history," he wrote in reply.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6124">'''R. Jay Wallace''' (b. 1957) is a Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. His areas of specialization include [[moral philosophy]] and [[philosophy of action]].  He is most noted for his work on practical reason, moral psychology, and meta-ethics.

==Biography==
Wallace received his B.A. degree in 1979 from Williams College.  He earned the degree of B.Phil. from the University of Oxford in 1983. In 1988, he got his Ph.D. from Princeton University.&lt;ref&gt;http://philosophy.berkeley.edu/people/page/11&lt;/ref&gt;

He has taught at several universities, including:  [[Wesleyan University]], the [[University of Pennsylvania]], and the [[Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin]].  He has held visiting positions at the Universität Bielefeld, in the Research School of Social Sciences (RSSS) at the Australian National University, at the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, and at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch (New Zealand). He was the department chair at UC Berkeley from 2005 to 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://philosophy.berkeley.edu/people/page/11&lt;/ref&gt;  He declined the position of [[White's Professor of Moral Philosophy]] at [[Oxford University]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2013/12/senior-offers-declined-in-2013.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==

In his first major book, ''Responsibility and the Moral Sentiments,'' Wallace defended a view associated with [[P.F. Strawson]] according to which attributions of moral praise and blame do not depend on metaphysical claims about freedom of the will but on our moral practices.  The philosopher [[Annette Baier]] wrote that 
“This beautifully organized and lucidly argued book might be taken as a model of how a sustained philosophical argument should proceed. Wallace’s thesis is that our practices of holding persons responsible for their choices and actions, and reacting to those that offend against moral norms with blame, indignation or resentment, make perfectly good sense, even if determinism is true."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674766235&amp;content=reviews&lt;/ref&gt;

His collection of papers, ''Normativity and the Will,'' brings together essays mostly written in the decade after the 1996 book ''Responsibility and the Moral Sentiments,'' which "develop the moral psychology behind his Strawsonian account of moral responsibility as depending on our practices of holding people morally accountable."&lt;ref&gt;https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/23282-normativity-and-the-will-selected-essays-on-moral-psychology-and-practical-reason/&lt;/ref&gt;

His most recent book, ''The View from Here,'' was described by [[Thomas Nagel]] in the ''London Review of Books'' as follows:  "This interesting, careful and occasionally outrageous book explores the complex interaction and competition between the attitudes of affirmation and regret that are almost inevitable as we look back on our lives and celebrate or deplore the conditions and choices that have made us what we are – that underlie our successes and failures, and our personal attachments."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lrb.co.uk/v36/n07/thomas-nagel/an-invitation-to-hand-wringing&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Isfahan School''' ({{Lang-fa|''' مكتب اصفهان '''}}) is a school of [[Islamic philosophy]]. It was founded by groups of [[Persia]]n [[philosophers]], most notably [[Mir Damad]], [[Sheykh Baha'i]] and [[Mir Fendereski]]{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}.&lt;ref name="iranicaonline1"/&gt; The name was coined by Seyyed [[Hossein Nasr]] and [[Henry Corbin]].&lt;ref name="iranicaonline1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/isfahan-school-of-philosophy |title=ISFAHAN SCHOOL OF PHILOSOPHY – Encyclopædia Iranica |publisher=Iranicaonline.org |date= |accessdate=2016-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the attention of [[Abbas I of Persia|Shah Abbas]] during the [[Safavid]] Dynasty in [[Iran]] to intellectual tradition in [[Islam]], [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]] became a famous academic city, and the intellectual center of Iran{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} at the time, along with the cities of [[Rey, Iran|Rey]] and [[Shiraz, Iran|Shiraz]].

==Historical context{{Relevance inline|date=January 2017}}==
This school of thought began to develop once Iran was economically and politically stable. The [[Safavid]] court also provided funding for the arts, which also contributed to the development.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Andrew Newman|2006|p.90}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, there were many disputes between Shiite scholars, such as [[Ahamad Alavi]], and Christian and Jewish scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Rula Jurdi Abisaab|2004|p.79}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this period the intellectual life of [[Suhrevardi]] was revived by Mir Damad and Mulla Sadra.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Roger savory|2007|p. 217}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Seyyed Hosein Nasr, this school of thought plays an important role both in terms of the relation between philosophy and prophecy, and in the training of Mulla Sadra. The school of Isfahan is a subsidiary of the Shiraz school of philosophy. Several philosophers that were not part of the Shiraz school of thought had very important roles in preparing the Isfahan school, such as Ibn Turkah, Qadi Maybudi and Ibn Abi Jomhour Ahsaei. The group of founders then announced Shia as formal religion in Persia, in an attempt to unify the entire country, with Isfahan as their capital.

===Founder===
{{main|Mir Damad}}
[[Mir Damad]] founded the [[Isfahan]] philosophical school. He was the nephew of Muhaqiq Karaki, an important [[Shia]] scholar who had influence in the [[Shia]] jurisprudence. Some{{Who|date=January 2017}} consider him familiar with philosophical prophecy as a result to the problem of Time. Corbin describes Mir Damad as having an analytic mind and aware of religious foundation of knowledge. Perhaps the most important characteristic of Mira Damad's philosophy is a synthesis between [[Avicennism]] and [[Averroism]], or his synthesis is between the intellectual and the spiritual.&lt;ref name="iranicaonline1"/&gt; Mir Damad's theory on Time is as popular as Huduth Dahri's, though Damad's philosophical opinion is criticized by Huduth's pupil, Mulla Sadra. Historically, there was great strife between Mulla Sadra and Mir Damad, as a result of the differences of their philosophical theories on subjects such as time.&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y0ZFkdlCFnYC&amp;pg=PA357&amp;dq=isfahan-school-of-philosophy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAWoVChMI54WJlMHqyAIVQn8PCh08Aw_v#v=onepage&amp;q=isfahan-school-of-philosophy&amp;f=false |title=Islamic Philosophy from Its Origin to the Present: Philosophy in the Land of ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mir Fendereski====
{{main|Mir Fendereski}}
Mir Abul Qasim Findiriski was a peripatetic philosopher and follower of [[Farabi]] an [[Avicenna]]. He select a Peripatetic stance, as opposed to the illuminationists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AzG5llo3YCMC&amp;pg=PA764&amp;dq=Mir+findiriski&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBmoVChMIlOTOhtXqyAIVRPgOCh22KQLo#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=History of Civilizations of Central Asia: Development in contrast : from the ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a scholar, He taught several scientific subjects in the physical Isfahan school, such as mathematics and Medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FAQFMSKwRawC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq=Mir+findiriski&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwBGoVChMIlOTOhtXqyAIVRPgOCh22KQLo#v=onepage&amp;q=Mir%20findiriski&amp;f=false |title=From Essence to Being: The Philosophy of Mulla Sadra and Martin Heidegger - Muhammad Kamal - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is debated whether or not Mulla Sadra studied under him, though the two worked together extensivally.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} Mir Findiriski also studied other religions, such as [[Zoroastrianism]] and [[Hinduism|Hindi]]. He also wrote several works on Indian philosophy, a series of treatises on fine arts, and one on his mystical experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E3kE6_gRgI8C&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=Mir+findiriski&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAWoVChMI9pCwhcbqyAIVgicPCh3b_QD5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Mulla Sadra's Transcendent Philosophy - Muhammad Kamal - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2013-05-28 |accessdate=2016-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Nasr, he was all well rounded in different philosophy, poetry, alchemy, and the philosophy of Yoga. Mir Findiriski collaborated with Mir Damad to wrote a piece called the Treatise of Sanaiyyah attempting to link philosophy and prophecy.&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt; Mir Findiriski also attempted to translate several Indian philosophical works into Persian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IChnJl0Mu4sC&amp;pg=PA308&amp;dq=Mir+findiriski&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwCGoVChMIlOTOhtXqyAIVRPgOCh22KQLo#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Knowledge and the Sacred: Revisioning Academic Accountability - Seyyed Hossein Nasr - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spirituality ==

Although Confucianism is generally considered an ethical and philosophical system rather than a religion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chen|first1=Yong|title=Confucianism as Religion: Controversies and Consequences.|date=8 November 2012|publisher=Brill|isbn=90-04-24373-9|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are many spiritual aspects of the Seokjeon Daeje relying on belief in ancestral spirits.

The front gate of Munmyo, Sinsammun (spirit-three-gate), is kept closed except during ceremonies such as the Seokjeon Daeje and the Goyurae ceremony which is held for important events such as university graduations at [[SKKU]], matriculation ceremonies, and inaugurations of new university presidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lee|first1=Seung-han|title=SKKU inaugurates 20th President Chung Kyu-sang|url=http://www.skku.edu/eng_home/campus/skk_comm/news_view.jsp?page=5&amp;boardNum=966&amp;skey=BOARD_SUBJECT&amp;keyword=|accessdate=8 April 2015|agency=Sungkyunkwan University|date=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The central entrance, usually reserved in royal palaces for kings, is intended only for the spirits of Confucius and his disciples. The path known as Yeongshin (spirit path) stretching from Sinsammun to Daeseongjeon is intended only for spirits, and visitors are prevented from crossing it during ceremonies by specially designated workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dunbar|first1=Jon|title=Sungkyunkwan, the royal university of Joseon|url=http://blog.korea.net/?p=20476|accessdate=8 April 2015|agency=Korea.net|publisher=Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism|date=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Munmyo Ilmu ==

The Munmyo Ilmu dance is performed in a grid of 8X8 dancers clad in red robes. Dance steps are slow, deliberate, and solemn. Throughout the ceremony, different hats are worn and different tools are held. Dancers raise their arms to the heavens to welcome spirits to earth, repeating the steps while facing each compass direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dunbar|first1=Jon|title=Confucian ceremony at Sungkyunkwan Munmyo|url=http://blog.korea.net/?p=26075|accessdate=8 April 2015|agency=Korea.net|publisher=Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism|date=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dance has been performed by [[SKKU]] students in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Choi|first1=Won-suk|title=Honoring Confucian sages|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2015/04/115_175694.html|accessdate=8 April 2015|agency=Korea Times|date=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To match the 64 dancers, there are 64 musicians playing a variety of percussion and woodwind instruments in a performance of ''munmyo jeryeak''. The music is a type of [[Aak]], punctuated by flat notes by striking a bell, which are maintained for several seconds before raising sharply at the end with the help of wood flutes.&lt;ref name="garland"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hzIt6ZL5lY0C&amp;pg=PA1201&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= The Concise Garland Encyclopedia of World Music, Volume 2 |series= Garland Encyclopedia of World Music |pages=1201–1202 |publisher = Routledge; 1 edition |year= 2008 |isbn=978-0415994040 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sesto Pals''', pen name of '''Simion''' (or '''Semion''') '''Șestopali''' (born Шестопаль, also rendered as ''S(h)estopal'', ''Sestopaly'', or ''Sestopali''; ca. 1912 – October 27, 2002), was a [[Russian Empire|Russian]]-born [[Romania]]n and [[Israel]]i writer. Primarily a poet-philosopher, he also earned recognition as a graphic artist. He first became known in his teenage years, when, as a friend and associate of [[Gherasim Luca]], he put out the review ''Alge''. Its [[avant-garde]] aesthetics and its testing of censorship resulted in their prosecution. While Luca endured as a public intellectual and a founder of the Romanian [[Surrealism|surrealist]] cell, Pals became a recluse.

Forgotten by the general public, exposed to antisemitic and later communist persecution, he continued to write for himself and an intimate circle of friends. He had a successful career in civil and railway engineering, but political nonconformity resulted in his marginalization for part of the 1960s.

Moving to [[Haifa]] in 1970, Pals was rediscovered by later generations of Romanian and Israeli readers, known to them for the moderate surrealism of his poetry and prose, and, to a lesser degree, for his take on [[Hegelianism|Hegelian philosophy]]. His editorial debut came well into his 80s, when Pals was already bedridden and contemplating death. This led to his rediscovery as a contributor to both [[Romanian literature|Romanian]] and [[Israeli literature]].

His father obtained protection status from the Italian diplomatic mission, before moving with his family to Romania and legally changing his name to ''Emanoil Șestopali''.&lt;ref name="mfalgiștii"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lsrepere"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pcsubter"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Paul Cernat]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Sesto-Pals-avangardistul-subteran*articleID_8764-articles_details.html "Sesto Pals, avangardistul subteran"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 179, July–August 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mfdialoguri"&gt;{{ro icon}} Michäel Finkenthal, [http://www.viataromaneasca.eu/arhiva/63_viata-romaneasca-11-12-2009/28_eseuri/499_sesto-pals-dialoguri-intre-intuneric-si-lumina.html "Sesto Pals, dialoguri între întuneric și lumină"], in ''[[Viața Românească]]'', Nr. 11-12/2009&lt;/ref&gt; Simion's mother, Berta née Berman, later arranged for her own relatives to settle in the new country.&lt;ref name="mfdialoguri"/&gt; They lived in [[Galați]], where Simion and Fima began their schooling, until 1923, then moved to [[Bucharest]].&lt;ref name="mfalgiștii"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lsrepere"/&gt; Simion enlisted at the [[Matei Basarab National College (Bucharest)|Matei Basarab High School]], where he was colleagues with poet Gherasim Luca. Sharing a school-desk, the two became close friends.&lt;ref name="mflagranițele"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mfalgiștii"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lsrepere"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pcsubter"/&gt; They also associated with [[Aurel Baranga]], who was in the same school, but slightly younger.&lt;ref name="mfalgiștii"/&gt; Their circle also included female colleagues and admirers, among them Henriette Iacobsohn, future wife of the cartoonist [[Saul Steinberg]], and [[Amelia Pavel]], later an essayist and art historian. Pavel, who vacationed with Simion at [[Sovata]] in summer 1930, remembered him as a "nice and well-behaved youth".&lt;ref name="apanii30"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Amelia Pavel]], [http://www.romlit.ro/prieteni_din_anii_30 "Prieteni din anii '30"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 30/2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, all three young men made a habit of deriding cultural conventions: Pals was almost expelled from school when he burst out laughing during a lecture on poet-laureate [[Vasile Alecsandri]].&lt;ref name="mfalgiștii"/&gt; In 1930, having kept up with the Western European and Romanian avant-garde, Luca founded the radical youth magazine ''Alge'' ("Algae"), with collaborations from Șestopali (the nominal "chief editor"),&lt;ref name="mfalgiștii"/&gt; Baranga, and [[Jules Perahim]]; they were later joined by [[Paul Păun]]. Șestopali experimented with literary pseudonyms, sometimes signing his work for ''Alge'' as ''D. Amprent''&lt;ref name="mf1958i"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lsrepere"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mfdialoguri"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ipciudat41"&gt;Pop, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; and then, for the first time ever, ''Sesto Pals''. A quasi-anagram of his Romanian name-and-initial, it was sometimes corrected to ''Șesto Pals'' in later reference, but the poet always signed his work ''sans'' diacritic.&lt;ref name="mftransc2"&gt;{{ro icon}} Michäel Finkenthal, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/INTERSECTII.-Poezia-este-traire-transcendentala-%28II%29*articleID_26105-articles_details.html "Poezia este trăire transcendentală (II)"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 599, November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The family name probably originated in a Russian moniker for "six fingers" or "six toes", and Șestopali bragged that he himself had inherited an [[Polydactyly|extra toe]].&lt;ref name="apanii30"/&gt;

===Obscenity scandal===
Underfunded, ''Alge'' only put out six or seven issues in this 1930 edition.&lt;ref name="mfalgiștii"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lsrepere"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mfdialoguri"/&gt; By February 1932, Pals had established his own single-issue magazine, titled ''Muci'' ("Snot") and distributed free of charge at one of Perahim's art shows.&lt;ref name="mfalgiștii"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lsrepere"/&gt; Like Păun and the other ''Alge'' men, he was also co-opted by ''[[unu]]'', the more established avant-garde sheet, but had a tense encounter with its editor, [[Sașa Pană]].&lt;ref name="mfalgiștii"/&gt; Nonetheless, ''unu'' hosted some of Pals' prose poems, including one which mockingly advertised Perahim's art as a "horrid crime" against the state.&lt;ref name="mfalgiștii"/&gt; In addition to writing poetry, he was interested in hard science, taking his [[Romanian Baccalaureate|baccalaureate]] with honors in physics.&lt;ref name="mfalgiștii"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lsrepere"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mfdialoguri"/&gt; He barely passed the overall examination, after having again slammed Alecsandri's work in his Romanian literature paper.&lt;ref name="mfalgiștii"/&gt;

In 1933, Luca reissued ''Alge'' in a more licentious edition, and challenged the cultural establishment by sending a copy to [[Nicolae Iorga]], the nationalist historian and political figure. A clampdown on their activities followed: all known contributors were caught in a police investigation, and Pals' home was searched for incriminating proof. Despite no longer being a contributor (and feeling alienated by Păun and Baranga's leftist militancy), Pals was implicated by his nominal editorial contribution.&lt;ref name="mfalgiștii"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mfdialoguri"/&gt; He was eventually arrested and sent to [[Văcărești prison]], where his colleagues were also rounded up. Pals later recalled being subjected to a thorough interrogation by the [[examining magistrate]], and sharing a cell with a known communist. Taking his instructions from Iorga, the coroner alleged that the Șestopalis were themselves communists, sent in from the [[Soviet Union]] to subvert Romanian society.&lt;ref name="mfalgiștii"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mfdialoguri"/&gt; The family was threatened with expulsion.&lt;ref name="mfalgiștii"/&gt;

The writers' parents eventually obtained their release,&lt;ref name="lsrepere"/&gt; with Emanoil pleading with his son that he amend his ways.&lt;ref name="mf1958i"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mfalgiștii"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mfdialoguri"/&gt; The court ruled against the ''Alge'' group, and issued two-year suspended sentences against them. This tarnished their judicial record, leaving Pals exposed to persecution.&lt;ref name="mfalgiștii"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mfdialoguri"/&gt; Pals was traumatized by the whole experience, and no longer bothered with his college admission,&lt;ref name="lsrepere"/&gt; although his grades qualified him for enlistment at the [[Politehnica University of Bucharest|Bucharest Polytechnic]].&lt;ref name="mf1958i"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mfalgiștii"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mfdialoguri"/&gt;

In 1934, when he and his family were [[Romanian nationality law|naturalized Romanian]],&lt;ref name="mfalgiștii"/&gt; Pals finally matriculated with the Polytechnic, where he majored in [[mining engineering]] and [[metallurgy]].&lt;ref name="lsrepere"/&gt; He kept out of literary life. When, in 1939, Luca returned from Paris a committed [[Surrealism|surrealist]], Pals was invited to attend the sessions of his Bucharest surrealist circle. He did so on occasion, meeting with new recruits such as [[Dolfi Trost]] and [[Gellu Naum]], but, as Pals biographer Michäel Finkenthal notes, "chain smoked [and] kept himself dead silent."&lt;ref name="mflagranițele"/&gt; Pals himself later asserted: "I never did 'fade' out of sight, I have always been out of sight."&lt;ref name="mftransc2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mftransc1"&gt;{{ro icon}} Michäel Finkenthal, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/INTERSECTII.-Poezia-este-traire-transcendentala-%28I%29*articleID_26040-articles_details.html "Poezia este trăire transcendentală (I)"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 597, October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antisemitic persecution and communist oppression===
Pals graduated in 1940, just as the [[National Renaissance Front]] dictatorship had [[Antisemitic laws in Romania|barred Jews from employment]] in most fields, including technical.&lt;ref name="lsrepere"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mfdialoguri"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pcsubter"/&gt; Pushed out of literary life, Pals discovered philosophy, and became an avid reader of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]].&lt;ref name="mf1958i"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mfdialoguri"/&gt; Finkenthal notes that his "rather obsessive preoccupation" was "to quantify qualitative values", a "strange mixture of [[Hegelianism]] and abstract arithmetic".&lt;ref name="mfdialoguri"/&gt; Then, at the height of World War II, the Șestopalis came to be persecuted under tighter racial laws. Pals' brother Fima escaped to [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]].&lt;ref name="mfteoret"&gt;Michäel Finkenthal, "Gherasim Luca, teoretician al suprarealismului?", in ''Mozaicul'', Nr. 11-12/2013, pp. 7-8&lt;/ref&gt; Pals was singled out for compulsory labor, and sent to work as a "Jewish engineer" for the [[Căile Ferate Române|State Railways]].&lt;ref name="mflagranițele"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lsrepere"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mfdialoguri"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mfteoret"/&gt; Making occasional returns to Bucharest,&lt;ref name="mfteoret"/&gt; he had an amorous affair with Lucia "Lucy" Metsch, a Paris-trained painter of [[Bukovina Jews|Bukovina Jewish]] extraction. She had narrowly escaped the ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'', and was working at [[State Jewish Theater (Romania)|The Barașeum]].&lt;ref name="mfdialoguri"/&gt;

Pals sought full employment after the [[King Michael's Coup|antifascist coup of 1944]], and, in 1945, was dispatched to oversee the construction of railway tunnels in [[Cluj County]].&lt;ref name="lsrepere"/&gt; Later that year, he returned to Bucharest, joining the City Planning Institute as founder and president of its [[geotechnical engineering]] section.&lt;ref name="lsrepere"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pcsubter"/&gt; In 1946, engineer Șestopali parted with Lucy and married Valentina Berman. This created controversy: Valentina was Pals' first cousin and his junior by 15 years.&lt;ref name="mf1958i"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pcsubter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mfdialoguri"/&gt; She was also [[Holocaust in Romania|Holocaust survivor]], having just returned from the concentration camp in [[Berezivka]], [[Transnistria Governorate|Transnistria]].&lt;ref name="mfdialoguri"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ovsc(94)135"&gt;[[Ovid Crohmălniceanu]], ''Amintiri deghizate'', [[Editura Nemira]], Bucharest, 1994, p. 135.  {{ISBN|973-9144-49-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he still refrained from an open affiliation, Pals continued to visit Luca and the surrealists, introducing his wife to them.&lt;ref name="mflagranițele"/&gt; His half-sister-in-law, Mura Vlad, was a published novelist and translator from Russian.&lt;ref name="mslacrim6"/&gt;

The marriage soon crumbled: Pals was an absentee husband, and Valentina found it hard to cope with the rigors of life in [[Communist Romania]].&lt;ref name="mfdialoguri"/&gt; Working as a typist, she met the poet [[Ion Caraion]], becoming his admirer, muse, and lover.&lt;ref name="mf1958i"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mfdialoguri"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ovsc(94)135"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mslacrim6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rvsecretele"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Răzvan Voncu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/sesto_pals_i_secretele_avangardei "Sesto Pals și secretele avangardei"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 26/2014&lt;/ref&gt; Pals accepted the informal separation, resuming his love affair with Lucy Metsch,&lt;ref name="mf1958i"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rvsecretele"/&gt; who now worked as a scenic painter for [[Sahia Film]].&lt;ref name="lsrepere"/&gt; He was increasingly withdrawn and troubled, dedicating himself to writing down a whole corpus of literary and philosophical works that he would not publish.&lt;ref name="lsrepere"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rvsecretele"/&gt;

During that decade, the Șestopalis came into conflict with the communist regime. In 1957, an investigation began into Caraion's [[samizdat]] poetry, which was highly critical of the regime, and which Valentina had helped circulate. At the risk of incriminating himself, Pals returned to his conjugal home and protected his estranged wife.&lt;ref name="mf1958i"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rvsecretele"/&gt; In mid 1958, Valentina was arrested by the [[Securitate]], then implicated in Caraion's trial for sedition. She dismissed the option to denounce Caraion in exchange for freedom,&lt;ref name="ovsc(94)135"/&gt; and was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor.&lt;ref name="mf1958i"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mslacrim6"&gt;Sipoș, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dc-enegru"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Daniel Cristea-Enache]], [http://www.romlit.ro/ion_cel_negru "Ion cel Negru"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 2/2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, Pals applied for an exit visa and [[Aliyah|emigration to Israel]], a rebellious gesture which saw his demotion with reduced pay and his relocation to the remote town of [[Dej]].&lt;ref name="lsrepere"/&gt; Valentina, released from prison under a general amnesty, divorced him in 1963, and later married Caraion.&lt;ref name="lsrepere"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mfdialoguri"/&gt; Pals also married Lucy in 1965, and, starting 1967, retook his position at the Bucharest Planning Institute.&lt;ref name="lsrepere"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mfdialoguri"/&gt; He earned respect in the engineers' community, and had several professional awards to his name,&lt;ref name="mf1958i"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pcsubter"/&gt; while privately working on a set of essays which sought to reconcile Hegelianism with [[existentialism]] and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]].&lt;ref name="rvsecretele"/&gt;

===Emigration===
By his own account, Pals lived a quiet and exceptionally fulfilling life down to 1970: caught up in his work during daytime, he turned to writing literature at night, and reconnected with his avant-garde friends.&lt;ref name="lsrepere"/&gt; He still refrained from going public, although two of his close friends, former avant-garde writers Baranga and [[Geo Bogza]], were well regarded by the regime and could arrange him a publishing deal.&lt;ref name="mf1958i"/&gt; He was more preoccupied with discovering (as he put it) "the mystery of existence through one's own existence".&lt;ref name="lsrepere"/&gt; That interval came to an end in 1970, when he and his wife were allowed to emigrate. They were seen to their plane by Bogza, the dissenting communist.&lt;ref name="mfalgiștii"/&gt; Pals was forced by the authorities to leave his voluminous manuscripts behind in Romania; he split them into fascicles, which he hid in various places.&lt;ref name="lsrepere"/&gt; Ion and Valentina Caraion, together with their daughter Marta, were themselves allowed to leave in 1981, moving to [[Lausanne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Michäel Finkenthal, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/INTERSECTII.-Intersectie-europeana*articleID_16441-articles_details.html "Intersecție europeană"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 345, November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Caraion, who had agreed to collaborate with the Securitate in return for his freedom, was repeatedly blackmailed by his former supervisors.&lt;ref name="dc-enegru"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sipoș, pp. 6, 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Pals resumed his professional career in [[Haifa]], where he oversaw the digging of [[utility tunnel]]s.&lt;ref name="pcsubter"/&gt; He traveled outside the country to meet Luca, who was living in Paris.&lt;ref name="mflagranițele"/&gt; However, his health declined abruptly, and he was forced to take retirement in 1982.&lt;ref name="lsrepere"/&gt; He suffered from [[gastrointestinal cancer]], and was treated at the [[Rabin Medical Center]].&lt;ref name="generousrmc"&gt;[http://hospitals.clalit.co.il/Hospitals/Rabin/en-us/News/News-Year-2007/Pages/News-014.aspx ''A Generous Step Toward Prevention''], [[Rabin Medical Center]] Spokesman Department, November 25, 2007; retrieved December 29, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Working from his home, a small apartment in [[Bnei Brak]],&lt;ref name="mf1958i"/&gt; Pals focused entirely on philosophical essays, which he composed in French,&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Michäel Finkenthal, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/INTERSECTII.-Note-de-drum*articleID_16700-articles_details.html "Note de drum"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 351, December 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and a new set of [[visual poetry]] pieces. He reluctantly agreed to have samples of these works published in [[Romanian diaspora]] magazines—including Caraion's ''Don Quijote'' and Alexandru Lungu's ''Argo''.&lt;ref name="lsrepere"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pcsubter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mftransc2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mftransc1"/&gt; In 1985, the [[Honolulu]] exile [[Ștefan Baciu]] dedicated him a special issue of his ''MELE'', a poetry newsletter. It included homage pieces by his old friends Păun and Bogza.&lt;ref name="lsrepere"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pcsubter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mftransc2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu (2001), pp. 172, 200&lt;/ref&gt; Interviewed about his work by journalist Solo Har-Herescu in 1993, Pals was oblique: "I am not fit to answer, as my head is filled with those snake-like questions, poisoning my replies, eating them up as they [...] bite into their own tails, making it hard to know where tails begin and heads end." His only reason for writing was "an inner urging", as "so much better poems" already existed, which were still "of no use to the reading public".&lt;ref name="mftransc1"/&gt;

===Final years and death===
Sesto Pals the poet was rediscovered in Romania only after the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|1989 Revolution]]: in 1998, [[Nicolae Tzone]] published a book of his poetry with [[Editura Vinea]], as ''Omul ciudat'' ("The Bizarre Man"). It was only at this time that Pals' former colleagues in the Bucharest Planning Institute discovered that he was the same as the avant-garde poet, as one of them confessed in a letter to the editors.&lt;ref name="mf1958i"/&gt; ''Omul ciudat'' had a small circulation and, according to critic [[Răzvan Voncu]], was only popular among the "connoisseurs of the avant-garde".&lt;ref name="rvsecretele"/&gt; The book earned Pals the [[Benjamin Fondane]] Award, granted by the Association of Romanian Writers in Israel.&lt;ref name="lsrepere"/&gt; Pals' health condition was declining to such a degree that he had to be carried to that ceremony; by 1999, he was bedridden and [[Feeding tube|tube-fed]], but fully conscious and perfecting poems that were supposed to convey his final message to the world.&lt;ref name="lsrepere"/&gt; He was still working on this on October 17, 2002, when he had to be taken to hospital.&lt;ref name="lsrepere"/&gt;

Pals died in [[Tel Aviv]], on October 27, 2002.&lt;ref name="ipciudat41"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mfepistolă"&gt;{{ro icon}} Michäel Finkenthal, [http://www.revista-apostrof.ro/articole.php?id=312 "Epistolă despre trup"], in ''[[Apostrof]]'', Nr. 5-6/2006&lt;/ref&gt; Just days before this happened, the Romanian review ''[[Tribuna (Romania)|Tribuna]]'' hosted three of his final poems.&lt;ref name="lsrepere"/&gt; Pals' last work saw print a month later, in ''Ultima Oră'', the Tel Aviv Romanian-Jewish newspaper.&lt;ref name="lsrepere"/&gt; A revised edition of ''Omul ciudat'' came out at [[Editura Paideia]], with illustrations by Mariana Macri, daughter of Pals' friend [[Mihail (Marcel) Avramescu|Ionathan X. Uranus]].&lt;ref name="pcsubter"/&gt;

Much of Pals' sizable fortune was bequeathed to the Rabin Medical Center, founding a research unit "for early detection and prevention of gastrointestinal cancer".&lt;ref name="generousrmc"/&gt; Pals was survived by Lucy, who died in 2006, and by Valentina Caraion, both of whom participated in the effort to recover and edit his work.&lt;ref name="mf1958i"/&gt; Although most of Pals' texts remained unpublished and under-researched, a follow-up to ''Omul ciudat'', titled ''Întuneric și lumină'' ("Darkness and Light") was put out in Romania in 2007.&lt;ref name="ipciudat41"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rvsecretele"/&gt;

His 2013 centennial was celebrated in Romania under the auspices of the [[Museum of Romanian Literature]]&lt;ref name="mflagranițele"/&gt; and [[Gaudeamus Book Fair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.zf.ro/ziarul-de-duminica/targul-international-gaudeamus-programul-zilei-de-sambata-23-noiembrie-i-de-ziarul-de-duminica-11677108 "Târgul Internațional Gaudeamus. Programul zilei de sâmbătă, 23 noiembrie (I)"], in ''[[Ziarul Financiar]]'', November 15, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Interest in Pals' work and personality was kept alive by the philosopher-physicist Michäel Finkenthal, who also collected some of the lesser known prose works into a 2014 anthology.&lt;ref name="rvsecretele"/&gt; A fictionalized portrayal of Pals as "the bizarre poet" is found in [[Virgil Duda]]'s 2011 novel, ''Un cetățean al lumii'' ("A Citizen of the World").&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Paul Cernat]], [http://www.revista22.ro/legaturi-fara-frontiere-12823.html "Legături fără frontiere"], in ''[[Revista 22]]'', Nr. 1139, January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==

Various exegetes have reached the conclusion that Pals' ''Alge'' poetry is ahead of its time and context, one of the more notable contribution to the second-wave avant-garde in Romania. [[Paul Cernat]] describes a clash of visions between the "prophetic" ambitions of ''Alge'' and Pals' character, that of a "vulnerable introvert, terrorized by the precariousness of the human condition".&lt;ref name="pcsubter"/&gt; According to [[Ion Pop (literary historian)|Ion Pop]], some of these poems stand out among the "purely awkward exercises" of youth, as "unhinged" [[Expressionism|expressionist]] pieces in succession to those of [[Adrian Maniu]] and [[Jules Laforgue]].&lt;ref&gt;Pop, pp. 41, 43&lt;/ref&gt; Other, tamer, pieces were directly inspired by the [[Hermeticism (poetry)|hermetic]] [[Ion Barbu]]&lt;ref name="ipciudat41"/&gt; and the mainstream modernist [[Tudor Arghezi]].&lt;ref name="pcsubter"/&gt; Several poems are singled out by Crohmălnicanu for being biblical-themed and distinctly apocalyptic, while yet others are "socially-inspired", "unanimistic" and "fraternal", addressed to "those people I meet on the tram".&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu (2001), pp. 171-172&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid 1950s, when he settled for a format of [[blank verse]] and [[haiku]]s, Pals was prone to philosophical meditation, and explored much deeper into lyrical themes. As argued by Finkenthal, this change was prompted by his separation from Valentina: "From now on, the poet finds himself locked in a world where things happen, things change, where there is no longer room for any refuge into love or wisdom."&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Michäel Finkenthal, [http://www.revista-apostrof.ro/articole.php?id=142 "Sesto Pals în anul de grație 1958 (II)"], in ''[[Apostrof]]'', Nr. 12/2006&lt;/ref&gt; According to Voncu, there was another cultural layer: like [[Gellu Naum]] and other late arrivals on the avant-garde scene, Pals was moving away from the sheer negativity of ''Alge'', and attempting to construct instead a post-philosophical [[surrealism]].&lt;ref name="rvsecretele"/&gt; Cernat sees Pals' surrealism as having "a familiar face", with classical-format [[quatrain]]s like those of [[Tristan Tzara]], [[H. Bonciu]], and [[Jacques Prévert]].&lt;ref name="pcsubter"/&gt;

Some of Pals' poems, tentatively dated to 1958, seemingly allude to Valentina's arrest by the communists and the whole wave of political repression.&lt;ref name="mf1958i"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rvsecretele"/&gt; Such dark and brooding works are held by both Finkenthal and Voncu as proof that Caraion and Pals influenced each other directly, despite their erotic rivalry.&lt;ref name="rvsecretele"/&gt; One fragment depicts silent struggles between the scheming fishermen and their catch, implying that fish still have a dying hope:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|ro|Dar noaptea cînd luna nu mai are lumină
Cînd valurile cresc peste țărm
Cînd vîntul se unește cu întunericul
Atunci pescarii simt marele suflet al mării

Atunci, vietățile mării îi cheamă în adînc

But at night, the moon being left in its dimness,
The waves swelling over the shore,
The wind and the darkness colliding,
Fishermen will sense that great soul of the sea
Rising up from the depths...
Right then, sea creatures will beacon them down under,

In 1960s prose poems which display influences from [[Franz Kafka]] or [[Urmuz]],&lt;ref name="mfdialoguri"/&gt; Pals amplified his sense of bafflement about the human condition. Nonetheless, Finkenthal writes, his very series of lyrical verse hints at "truths that are inaccessible to common mortals".&lt;ref name="mfepistolă"/&gt; He reconciled himself with the idea of time by denying its concreteness, but drew a line between general time and "the time of creation". The latter allowed for a future, and therefore provided room for "affirmation and oblivion".&lt;ref name="mftransc1"/&gt; This meant that, "once he puts himself on the line, an artist will have to fade into his own affirmation."&lt;ref name="mftransc2"/&gt; The moribund Pals sketched out a quaint prophecy:
{{Verse translation|

Big drops of silence shall

'''Sextus Julius Africanus''' (c. 160 &amp;ndash; c. 240) was a [[Christian]] traveler and [[historian]] of the late second and early third centuries. He is important chiefly because of his influence on [[Eusebius]], on all the later writers of Church history among the [[Church Fathers]], and on the whole Greek school of chroniclers.

==Biography==
The [[Suda|Suidas]] claims Africanus was a "[[Ancient Libya|Libyan]] philosopher", while [[Gelzer]] considers him of Roman descent.{{sfn|Gelzer|1898|pp=4f}} Julius called himself a native of [[Jerusalem]] &amp;ndash; which some scholars consider his birthplace&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/bmcr/2008/2008-04-43.html Martin Wallraff (ed.), ''Iulius Africanus: Chronographiae. The Extant Fragments'', reviewed by Hagith Sivan (Bryn Mawr Classical Review)]&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; and lived at the neighbouring [[Emmaus Nicopolis|Emmaus]]. His chronicle indicates his familiarity with the topography of historic Judea.{{sfn|Gelzer|1898|p=10}}

Little of Africanus's life is known and all dates are uncertain. One tradition places him under the Emperor [[Gordianus III]] (238&amp;ndash;244), others mentions him under [[Severus Alexander]] (222&amp;ndash;235). He appears to have known [[Abgar VIII]].(176&amp;ndash;213).

Africanus may have served under [[Septimius Severus]] against the Osrhoenians in 195. He went on an embassy to the emperor [[Severus Alexander]] to ask for the restoration of [[Emmaus Nicopolis|Emmaus]], which had fallen into ruins. His mission succeeded, and Emmaus was henceforward known as [[Emmaus Nicopolis|Nicopolis]].

Africanus traveled to Greece and Rome and went to Alexandria to study, attracted by the fame of its catechetical school, possibly about the year 215.{{sfn|Gelzer|1898|p=11}} He knew Greek (in which language he wrote), Latin, and Hebrew. He was at one time a soldier and had been a pagan; he wrote all his works as a Christian.

Whether Africanus was a layman or a cleric remains controversial. [[Louis-Sébastien Le Nain de Tillemont]] argued from Africanus's addressing the priest [[Origen]] as "dear brother" that Julius must have been a priest himself&lt;ref&gt;Louis-Sébastien Le Nain de Tillemont, ''Mémoires pour servir à l'histoire ecclésiastique'', III, Paris, 1693, 254&lt;/ref&gt; but Gelzer points out that such an argument is inconclusive.{{sfn|Gelzer|1898|p=9}}

==Writings==
Africanus wrote ''Chronographiai'', a history of the world in five volumes. The work covers the period from Creation to the year AD 221. He calculated the period between [[Dating Creation|Creation]] and [[Jesus]] as 5500 years, placing the [[Incarnation]] on the first day of [[Anno Mundi|AM]] 5501 (our modern March 25 1 BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=La chronologie|author1=Vernance Grumel|first=|author2=Paul Lemerle|publisher=Presses universitaires de France|year=1958|isbn=|series=Traité d'études byzantines|location=Paris|pages=|quote="...the number of 5500 years as the period up to the advent of the Word of salvation, that was announced to the world in the time of the sway of the Cæsars" (Africanus, Chronology 1).}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Note that this dating implies that the birth of Jesus was in December, nine months later.) This method of reckoning led to several Creation eras being used in the [[Greek language|Greek]] Eastern [[Mediterranean]], which all placed Creation within one decade of 5500 BC.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

The history, which had an apologetic aim, is no longer extant. But copious extracts from it are to be found in the ''Chronicon'' of [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]], who used it extensively in compiling the early episcopal lists. There are also fragments in [[George Syncellus]], [[Cedrenus]] and the ''[[Chronicon Paschale]].'' Eusebius gives some extracts from his letter to one Aristides,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911}} cites: ''Hist. Ecc.'' i. 7; vi. 31&lt;/ref&gt; reconciling the apparent discrepancy between Matthew and Luke in the genealogy of Christ by a reference to the Jewish law of [[Levirate marriage]], which compelled a man to marry the widow of his deceased brother, if the latter died without issue. His terse and pertinent letter to [[Origen]] impugning the authority of the part of the [[Book of Daniel]] that tells the story of [[Susanna (Book of Daniel)|Susanna]], and Origen's wordy and uncritical answer, are both extant.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

The ascription to Africanus of an encyclopaedic work entitled ''[[Kestoi]]'' (Κέστοι "Embroidered"), treating of agriculture, natural history, military science, etc., has been disputed on account of its secular and often credulous character. [[August Neander]] suggested that it was written by Africanus before he had devoted himself to religious subjects. A fragment of the ''Kestoi'' was found in the [[Oxyrhynchus papyri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911}} cites: Grenfell and Hunt, iii. 36 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge]], the Kestoi "appears to have been intended as a sort of encyclopedia of the material sciences with the cognate mathematical and technical branches, but to have contained a large proportion of merely curious, trifling, or miraculous matters, on which account the authorship of Julius has been questioned. Among the parts published are sections on agriculture, liturgiology, tactics, and medicine (including veterinary practise)."

==Prophetic exegesis==
Only fragments of his religious writings have been preserved.  One fragment deals with [[eschatology]].

;Prophecy of Daniel 8

After referring to the standard interpretation of the 'ram' and the 'he-goat', as symbolizing Persia and Greece, Africanus suggested that the 2300 days might be taken form months, totaling about 185 years which he applied to the time from the Capture of Jerusalem to the 20 year of Artaxerxes.  He seems to be the only one who developed this interpretation.{{sfn|Froom|1950|p=280}}

;The 70th week

Africanus begins the seventy weeks Daniel 9 with the twentieth year of Artaxerxes, in Olympiad 83, year 4, (444 B.C.) and ends the period in Olympiad 202, year 2, (31 A.D.) or 475 solar years inclusive, which would be equivalent to 490 uncorrected lunar years. {{sfn|Froom|1950|pp=279–281}}

==Verification of Moses==
This work does not survive except in fragments, chiefly those preserved by Eusebius and Georgius Syncellus. In turn Africanus preserves fragments of the work of [[Polemon of Athens]]' Greek History.

* FRAGMENT 13: From Georgius Syncellus, ''Chron.'', Third Book. In Euseb., ''Præpar.'', X. 40:
** 6. And from Moses, then, to the first Olympiad there are 1020 years, as to the first year of the 55th Olympiad from the same are 1237, in which enumeration the reckoning of the Greeks coincides with us.
:: [...] Polemo, for instance, in the first book of his Greek History, says: In the time of [[Apis, king of Argos]], son of Phoroneus, a division of the army of the Egyptians left Egypt, and settled in the Palestine called Syrian, not far from Arabia: these are evidently those who were with Moses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Colavito|first1=Jason|title=The Chronography: Sextus Julius Africanus after 221 CE  trans. in the Ante-Nicene Christian Library 1869|url=http://www.jasoncolavito.com/julius-africanus-chronography.html|website=JasonColavito.com|publisher=Jason Colavito|accessdate=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grotius|first1=Hugo|author2=John CLARKE (Dean of Salisbury.)|title=The Truth of the Christian Religion ...

{{ZenBuddhism}}

{{Nihongo|'''Shihō'''|嗣法|}} refers to a series of ceremonies in [[Sōtō]] [[Zen Buddhism]] wherein a ''unsui'' receives [[Dharma transmission]], becoming part of the dharma lineage of his or her teacher.

==Ceremony==
Shiho is done "one-to-one in the abbot's quarters (hojo)".&lt;ref name=Antaiji2 group=web /&gt;{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=264-265}}

''Shiho'', or ''denpo'', is the [[Dharma transmission]] ceremony where the student inherits the Dharma, and is empowered to transmit the lineage.&lt;ref&gt;O'Halloran, 205&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''denpo'' ceremony, the student becomes an ancestor of the tradition and receives a robe and bowl, among other objects.&lt;ref name="anderson"/&gt;

During the denpo ceremony the student receives a Shoshike certificate, which grants the power to perform [[Jukai]], and the documents known as the "three regalia of transmission":
{{quote|a) Shisho (the scripture of transmission, the names of the ancestors arranged in a circle - the dharma has passed on from to Shakyamuni to yourself, and now you give it back to Shakyamuni. There is a small piece of paper, probably originally written by Sawaki Roshi, with some comments. This paper is also copied by the student when doing dharma transmission at Antaiji.)&lt;br&gt;
b) Daiji (the great matter, a cryptic symbolization of the content of the teaching. Again, there is a small extra sheet of paper that explains about the meaning of the symbols.)&lt;br&gt;
c) [[Kechimyaku]] (the blood lineage, looks quite similar to the blood line transmission that you already wrote at the time of ordination)&lt;br&gt;
d) Actually, in the lineage of Sawaki Roshi (and maybe other lineages as well) a student is told to write a fourth document on an extra sheet of paper, which is called Hisho (the secret document, which is encoded, but the code for deciphering is on the same paper, so once you hold it in your hands it is not so "secret" anymore.)&lt;ref group=web name=Antaiji2&gt;[http://antaiji.dogen-zen.de/eng/201005.shtml Muho Noelke, ''Part 2: Ten points to keep in mind about dharma transmission'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Sōtō-shu also confers [[Dharma transmission|inka]] shōmyō (or ''inshō'') "[granting] the seal of approval to a realization of enlightenment",{{sfn|Bodiford|1991|p=423}} upon students. This is an 
{{quote|... idealized religious aspect of the Dharma transmission process. Zen master and disciple may evoke this mystical paradigm through ritual ceremony in the master's room (''shi-tsunai''), but other, more mundane institutional concerns can govern the actual selection and promotion of Dharma 'heirs'.{{sfn|Bodiford|1991|p=423}}}}

In the [[White Plum Asanga]], a shiho ceremony can last anywhere from one to three weeks. Prior to dharma transmission,  transmission of the precepts from master to disciple, known as ''denkai'', takes place, where the master confirms that the student is actualizing the precepts in his/her day-to-day life.&lt;ref&gt;Loori, 228&lt;/ref&gt; In this ceremony the student "...become[s] the blood of the Buddha."&lt;ref name="anderson"&gt;Anderson, xxi-xxii&lt;/ref&gt;

==Status==
In the emerging western Zen-practice, after following completion of these ceremonies the teacher becomes independent.&lt;ref&gt;Kay, 236&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spuler, 58&lt;/ref&gt;

This is quite distinct from the actual practice in Japanese Sōtō-zen:
{{quote|[D]harma transmission provides access to only a relatively low grade. It is listed as a requirement for the very lowest ecclesiastical status, that of an instructor third class (''[[Zen ranks and hierarchy|santō kyōshi]]''). Thus, in present day Sōtō Zen, dharma transmission constitutes a preliminary step, after which one's real development begins [...] Today, the key authority conferred by dharma transmission is that it qualifies a priest to manage an ordinary (''jun hōchi'') local temple. These temples are not ascetic training but of ceremonial services on behalf of lay patrons.{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|276}}}}

To supervise training monks, further qualifications are required:
{{quote|The relatively low status of dharma transmission means that in and of itself it does not qualify one to accept students or to train disciples. According to the regulations, Zen students should be supervised only by a teacher who has attained supervisory certification (i.e. ''sanzen dōjō shike'' status), that is, someone who in the popular literature might be called a [[Zen master]]. To attain supervisory certification requires not just high ecclesiastical grades and dharma seniority but also at least three years' experience as an assistant supervisor at a specially designated training hall (''tokubetsu sōdō''), during which time one undergoes an apprenticeship.{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|276}}}}

'''''The Death of the West: How Dying Populations and Immigrant Invasions Imperil Our Culture and Civilization''''' is a 2001 book by [[paleoconservative]] commentator [[Patrick J. Buchanan]], in which the author argues that western culture is dying and will soon be imperilled. Western cultures have lower-than-replacement birth rates while populations in Africa, Asia, and Latin America are exploding. 

== Summary ==
Buchanan argues that the United States will be a Third World Nation by the year 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stewartsynopsis.com/death_by_blackness_files/Deathofthewest.htm|title=Death of the West - Pat Buchanan|website=www.stewartsynopsis.com|access-date=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; He uses [[United Nations]] population statistics to analyze the recent trends in global populations, especially major declines in European nations and major increases in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. 

Buchanan argues that the United States has a "[[State within a state|nation within a nation]]" already. The population of 30 million foreign born (of which 11 million are illegal aliens) is larger than the entire population of [[Rhode Island]], [[Massachusetts]], and [[Connecticut]]. 

Buchanan argues that [[Counterculture of the 1960s|"counter culture" of the 1960s]] has become the dominant culture, which aims to rewrite American history and dismantle its heritage. He says: "A new generation has now grown up for whom the cultural revolution is not a revolution at all, but the culture they were born into and have known all their lives.&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;

He also argues that the death of the Christian faith is the primary cause of low birth rates, hopelessness, and political utopianism. He cites examples of anti-Christian sentiment such as the negative reactions to Catholic films and the triumphant attitude of secularism. He says: "Western Man has decided he can disobey God without consequence and become his own God." And at the same time: "The new hedonism seems unable to give people a reason to go on living."

==Reception==
John Attarian praised the book. &lt;blockquote&gt;To avert catastrophe, Buchanan rightly calls for repudiating the left's ideology of national suicide. But he offers valuable specifics too. It may be too late for Europe to exit the highway, but America still can. Depopulation being the worse problem, we must encourage American women to have children, with pro-family tax relief such as raising the federal tax credit for each child, giving employers tax incentives to pay parents higher wages, and so on... Buchanan concedes that it may be too late to save the West, but closes by affirming that America is a beautiful country. "And that is why we must never stop trying to take her back." That call to undaunted perseverance is the right parting note.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thesocialcontract.com/artman2/publish/tsc1203/article_1083.shtml|title=The Social Contract - Book Review of 'Death of the West' by Patrick Buchanan|website=www.thesocialcontract.com|access-date=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' panned the book. The review called it "[s]hameless, embarrassing rantings" and also remarked that "[l]ittle attests to the moral health of this nation more than the fact that it’s made a mockery of Buchanan's presidential ambitions time and again." The review particularly criticized Buchanan's claim that "[h]ad it not been for the West, African rulers would still be trafficking in the flesh of their kinsmen" as an example of dishonest historical revisionism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/patrick-j-buchanan/the-death-of-the-west/|date=November 15, 2001|accessdate=October 27, 2012|publisher=''[[Kirkus Reviews]]''|title=The Death of the West by Patrick J. Buchanan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jonah Goldberg]] of ''[[The National Review]]:''  &lt;blockquote&gt;First, let me say I both admire and dislike Buchanan's writing for the same reason: He brilliantly manages to do with one language what [[Yassir Arafat]] does with two. He offers red meat to the extremists while at the same giving himself the wiggle room to deny he said anything controversial in the first place. This is no mean feat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Jonah|last=Goldberg|authorlink=Jonah Goldberg|work=[[The National Review]]|title=Goldberg File|date=February 25, 2002|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/205150/killing-whitey-jonah-goldberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Thomas Metzinger''' (born 12 March 1958) is a German [[philosopher]] and professor of [[theoretical philosophy]] at the [[Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz]]. {{As of | 2011}}, he is an Adjunct Fellow at the [[Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies]] and on the advisory board of the [[Giordano Bruno Foundation]]. From 2008 to 2009 he served as a Fellow at the [[Berlin Institute for Advanced Study]]; from 2014 to 2019 he is a Fellow at the [[Gutenberg Research College]].

==Work==
Metzinger has been active since the early 1990s in the promotion of [[consciousness]] studies as an academic endeavour. As a co-founder, he has been particularly active in the organization of the [[Association for the Scientific Study of Consciousness]] (ASSC), and sat on the board of directors of that organisation from 1995 to 2008.  He served as president of the ASSC in 2009/10. Metzinger is director of the [http://fias.uni-frankfurt.de/philosophie/ MIND group] and has been president of the [http://www.gk-ev.de/ German cognitive science society] from 2005 to 2007. In English he has published two edited works, ''Conscious Experience'' (1995), and ''Neural correlates of consciousness: empirical and conceptual issues'' (2000).  The latter book arose out of the second ASSC meeting, for which he acted as local organizer. In 2015, together with Jennifer M. Windt, he published the [http://open-mind.net Open MIND-collection], containing more than 100 original, peer-reviewed open access-papers from philosophy of mind, cognitive science, and neuroscience. A follow-up project (2017) was [http://predictive-mind.net Philosophy and Predictive Processing-collection].

In 2003 Metzinger published the monograph ''Being No One''. In this book he argues that no such things as [[self (philosophy)|selves]] exist in the world: nobody ever had or was a self. All that exists are [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenal selves]], as they appear in conscious experience. He argues that the phenomenal self, however, is not a thing but an ongoing process; it is the content of a "transparent [[Self-model theory of subjectivity|self-model]]." In 2009 Metzinger published a follow-up book to ''Being No One'' for a general audience: ''The Ego Tunnel'' (Basic Books, New York, {{ISBN|0-465-04567-7}}).

Metzinger's work addresses some of the fundamental issues in neurobiology, consciousness, and the relationship between [[mind and body]].

Metzinger's interests include:

* [[Philosophy of mind]] (esp. philosophical aspects of empirical theories in the neuro- and cognitive sciences, artificial intelligence, and related areas of research).
* [[Ethics]] (esp. conceptual connections between applied ethics, the philosophy of mind and anthropology)

Metzinger supervises [https://teamweb.uni-mainz.de/fb05/Neuroethics/SitePages/Home.aspx The Neuroethics Web Portal]. He is currently serving on the editorial board for the journal [http://nc.oxfordjournals.org/ Neuroscience of Consciousness].

== Background ==
Trauma-sensitive yoga has been adapted from traditional yoga. Traditional [[yoga]] is a form of exercise conceptualized as a mind-body practice, which incorporates man forms and varies by class style. It typically includes techniques of body positioning, typically referred to as “physical postures”, and includes breathing exercises, [[mindfulness]], and [[meditation]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nguyen-Feng|first=V.

TSY was first established at the Trauma Center in Brookline, Massachusetts by David Emerson and colleagues. It was designed to promote an enhanced feeling of safety for individuals as they engage in an exercise that is focused on body awareness, which may otherwise be overwhelming for a traumatized population.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Emerson|first=D.|last2=Sharma|first2=R.|last3=Chaudhry|first3=S.|last4=Turner|first4=J.|date=2009|title=Trauma-sensitive yoga: principles, practice, and research|url=|journal=International Journal of Yoga Therapy|volume=19|pages=123-128|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; TSY addresses the need for a trauma-informed yoga practice that could identify and mitigate potentially triggering environmental and physiological circumstances,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nguyen-Feng|first=V. N.|last2=Morrissette|first2=J.|last3=Lewis-Dmello|first3=A.|last4=Michel|first4=H.|last5=Anders|first5=D.|last6=Wagner|first6=C.|last7=Clark|first7=C. J.|date=2018|title=Trauma-sensitive yoga as an adjunctive mental health treatment for survivors of intimate partner violence: a qualitative examination|url=|journal=Spirituality in Clinical Practice|volume=|pages=1-17|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while still providing the psychological and physical benefits that typical [[yoga]] practice offers.

TSY has been heavily formulated out of five core domains which are crucial to consider as they could produce adverse side effects under nonoptimal conditions among a traumatized population, potentially due to production of reminders of practitioners’ [[Psychological trauma|traumas]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The first core domain of TSY is the environment. TSY places greater emphasis on the environment as compared with traditional [[yoga]], as trauma survivors must feel that the space is welcoming, safe, and comfortable, in order to minimize overwhelming feelings of vulnerability.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The second core domain of TSY is the physical exercise. While traditional yoga places a strong weight on achieving a particular posture, TSY highlights the importance of internal sensations in such postures to promote feelings of safety and self-acceptance.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The third and fourth core domains are the hands-on adjustments and instructor style. Traditional yoga teachers are often directive and may provide hands-on adjustments to students' postures, whereas TSY instructors are encouraged to provide gentleness and space, and allow students to remain in control of their practice.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Lastly, in contrast to traditional yoga instructors, TSY instructors pay particular attention to their directive language as traditional yoga verbiage could be a reminder of one's [[Psychological trauma|trauma]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Rationale ==

=== Psychological trauma and the body ===
[[Psychological trauma]] occurs when an individual has experienced a traumatic event, which becomes lived and relived in the body and the mind.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tzu|first=G.|last2=Bannerman|first2=B.|date=2017|title=Transforming trauma into healing and being: a non-dual therapy approach|url=|journal=International Journal of Mental Health and Addiction|volume=15|pages=63-79|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Trauma and the body: A sensorimotor approach to psychotherapy|last=Ogden|first=P.|last2=Minton|first2=K.|last3=Pain|first3=C.|publisher=W.

A.|date=2006|title=Clinical implications of neuroscience research in PTSD|url=|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|volume=1071|pages=277-293|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, psychological trauma is not only associated with psychological disorders such as [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and [[anxiety]],&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; but also with somatic disorders.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Afari|first=Niloofar|last2=Ahumada|first2=Sandra M.|last3=Wright|first3=Lisa Johnson|last4=Mostoufi|first4=Sheeva|last5=Golnari|first5=Golnaz|last6=Reis|first6=Veronica|last7=Cuneo|first7=Jessica Gundy|date=January 2014|title=Psychological Trauma and Functional Somatic Syndromes|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/PSY.0000000000000010|journal=Psychosomatic Medicine|language=en|volume=76|issue=1|pages=2–11|doi=10.1097/psy.0000000000000010|issn=0033-3174|pmc=3894419|pmid=24336429}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Though most [[Evidence-based practice|evidence-based treatments]] focus on the psychological effects of trauma first and foremost,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; attrition rates are still high, possibly due to heightened physiological arousal during the initial stages of [[exposure therapy]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van der Kolk|first=B.

K.|publisher=Springer International|year=2014|isbn=|location=Switzerland|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, [[Mind–body interventions|mind-body approaches]] help the traumatized individual to nurture the body using internal resources.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In this way, messages from the physical body may provide information for traumatized individuals about their identities and help individuals regain ownership over their internal responses.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berg|first=A.

=== Physiological effects ===
The techniques of [[yoga]], in general, have been shown to alleviate effects on the body’s nervous system.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The mindfulness and meditation aspect of [[yoga]] allows the mind to maintain objective awareness on the body’s physical sensations, while maintaining a state of calm.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Follette|first=Victoria|last2=Palm|first2=Kathleen M.|last3=Pearson|first3=Adria N.|date=March 2006|title=Mindfulness and trauma: implications for treatment|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10942-006-0025-2|journal=Journal of Rational-Emotive &amp; Cognitive-Behavior Therapy|language=en|volume=24|issue=1|pages=45–61|doi=10.1007/s10942-006-0025-2|issn=0894-9085}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aspect of yoga geared toward breath manipulation has been shown to play a role in enhanced capacity for [[Emotional self-regulation|emotion regulation]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Granath|first=Jens|last2=Ingvarsson|first2=Sara|last3=von Thiele|first3=Ulrica|last4=Lundberg|first4=Ulf|date=March 2006|title=Stress Management: A Randomized Study of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and Yoga|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1080%2F16506070500401292|journal=Cognitive Behaviour Therapy|language=en|volume=35|issue=1|pages=3–10|doi=10.1080/16506070500401292|issn=1650-6073}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=R.

== Key features ==
Trauma-sensitive yoga (TSY) is designed to begin gently, with a seated breathing exercise, followed by light movements.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While adhering to the particular TSY conditions of the five core domains (i.e., physical environment, exercises, teaching style, adjustments, and language),&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; the instructor guides the class through a series of physical postures at a level of difficulty fitting the advancement of the participants&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. In each posture, instructors encourage students to observe their internal sensations, without judgment, and respond to them compassionately.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Throughout TSY, participants are encouraged to make choices for themselves about what feels comfortable and safe in their bodies, and instructors spaciously invite students to modify any posture as needed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; TSY class ends similarly to traditional yoga in a resting pose (“savasana”) wherein students lie face up on the floor with their arms wide and eyes closed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  

=== Safe-keeping ===
Certain conditions remain constant in TSY to ensure that participants have a felt sense of safety. Such conditions include consistency of room appearance and class structure, instructors' reminders to participants of where the exits are located, and bright lights so participants can see their surroundings.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

== Trauma-sensitive yoga for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) ==

=== Mechanisms ===
Individuals who have experienced [[psychological trauma]] often view their internal body sensations as dangerous and foreign, and form destructive habits as a means of coping with their internal experiences.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Throughout TSY, instructors strive to create an environment that feels both physically and emotionally safe for the participants, thereby facilitating a healing atmosphere for traumatic individuals.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; When students feel increased levels of safety and groundedness in their environment, they are said to be at an appropriate mid-range level of arousal for working with their [[Psychological trauma|traumas]] effectively.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Once TSY participants are at a mid-range level of arousal, they can learn to work with the physiological experiences of trauma in a more adaptive and less destructive manner.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

=== PTSD populations ===

==== Victims of interpersonal violence ====
Research suggests that trauma-sensitive yoga (TSY) is effective for improving the psychological symptoms for women who have survived [[Domestic violence|interpersonal violence]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Improvements may include a reduction in [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|PTSD]] symptom severity,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Price|first=M.|last2=Spinazzola|first2=J.|last3=Musicaro|first3=R.|last4=Turner|first4=J.|last5=Suvak|first5=M.|last6=Emerson|first6=D.|last7=van der Kolk|first7=B.|date=2017|title=Effectiveness of an extended yoga treatment for women with chronic posttraumatic stress disorder|url=|journal=The Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine|volume=23|pages=300-309|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; reduction in [[Depression (mood)|depression]] symptom severity,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; and reduction in [[anxiety]] symptom severity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition to symptom alleviation, research has found that survivors of [[Domestic violence|interpersonal violence]] who engage in TSY have reported increased feelings of safety and agency,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; higher [[self-esteem]] and [[self-compassion]], decreased feelings of isolation, greater feelings of relaxation, and a greater sense of agency over their own bodies, as compared with prior to TSY.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; 

== Current research ==
Currently, research has highlighted the importance of utilizing trauma-sensitive yoga (TSY) only as an alternative and complementary treatment to other [[Evidence-based practice|evidence-based treatments]] (e.g., [[psychotherapy]], medication) for trauma.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; TSY classes are designed to differ from class to class, and thus efficacy has not been established.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Research has suggested the use of TSY as a primer to individual psychotherapy, as a means of preparing and grounding the body before uncovering the stored traumatic memories,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; and establishing a traumatized individual’s buy-in for treatment.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

It may be important for consumers of TSY to consider the matter of [[confidentiality]] as it differs between TSY instructors and mental health professionals.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Though TSY instructors are most often required to complete at least 200 hours of [[yoga]] instructor training with a [[Psychological trauma|trauma]] focus, confidentiality is typically not the focus of training.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

He was born and educated in [[Prague]]. In 1846 he became a lecturer in aesthetics, afterwards in philosophy, at the [[Charles University in Prague|University of Prague]], and in 1856 was appointed to a professorship in philosophy there. His chief studies were in the exact psychology of the school of [[Johann Friedrich Herbart|Herbart]], for whose general principles Volkmann was probably the most conspicuous expounder.

Volkmann's most important publication is the ''Lehrbuch der Psychologie vom Standpunkte des philosophischen Realismus'' (Treatise on Psychology from the Standpoint of Philosophical Realism, 1856; 4th ed., by Cornelius, 1894–95).  In its first edition it was called ''Grundriss ...'' (Outline ...).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5012">'''Wilhelm Jerusalem''' (October 11, 1854 in [[Drenitz]]/[[Drenic]] ([[Dřenice (Chrudim District)|Dřenice u Chrudimi]]), [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]] – July 15, 1923 in [[Vienna]]) was an [[Austrians|Austrian]] [[Jewish]] [[philosopher]] and pedagogue.

==Biography==
Jerusalem studied classical philosophy at the University of [[Prague]] and prepared a doctorate entitled  "The Inscription of Sestos and Polybios". Until 1887 he was a teacher at grammar schools in Prague and Nikolsburg. In 1888 he became a member of the staff of teachers at the grammar school "k.k. Staatsgymnasium im VIII.Bezirk" (''Bundesgymnasium Wien 8'') in Vienna. In 1891 he was an outside lecturer at the University of Vienna. One of his interests was education, and he demanded a change of the educational system in the Austro-Hungarian monarchy. Another of his fields of interest was the education of minorities. He wrote a monograph about the education of the [[deafblind]]. In 1890 he published a psychological study about the deafblind [[Laura Bridgman]]. 

He is regarded as the discoverer of the literary talent of the deaf-blind writer [[Helen Keller]] and corresponded with her.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Gantschacher ''Wilhelm Jerusalem – Helen Keller – Letters''. 2008; {{ISBN|978-3-9503173-0-5}}  ARBOS-Edition, 2010-2012&lt;/ref&gt; They never met personally. From scientific work about the deafblind he developed the Austrian direction of the philosophical method of "[[Pragmatism]]". In 1907 he translated [[William James]]'s "Pragmatism" into German.  After World War I he became an associate professor of philosophy and educational theory at the University of Vienna . In 1919 he became one of the teachers of the "Schönbrunner Schule" ([[Schönbrunn School]]) which came about after the Vice Mayor of Vienna [[Max Winter (Vienna Vice Mayor)|Max Winter]] had obtained a considerable part of the Viennese [[Schönbrunn Palace]] to be used for the advancement of the education of young women, and a small number of men, to become educators and teachers.

In 1923, Jerusalem became a Professor of the University of Vienna. He died of a heart attack on 15 July 1923, in Vienna.

Among his students were the writer [[Stephan Hock]], the politician [[Karl Renner]], the composer [[Viktor Ullmann]], the poet [[Anton Wildgans]] and [[Otto Felix Kanitz]].

'''William Molyneux''' &lt;small&gt;[[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]]&lt;/small&gt; ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɒ|l|ɪ|nj|uː}}; 17 April 1656 – 11 October 1698) was an [[Irish people|Irish]] writer on science, politics and [[natural philosopher|natural philosophy]].

He is noted as a close friend of fellow philosopher [[John Locke]], and for proposing [[Molyneux's Problem]], a [[thought experiment]] widely discussed. 

==Life==
He was born in [[Dublin]] to Samuel Molyneux (1616–1693), lawyer and landowner (whose grandfather, Sir [[Thomas Molyneux]], had come to Dublin from [[Calais]] in the 1560s), and his wife, Anne, née Dowdall.&lt;ref&gt;Dublin Historical Record, 1960&lt;/ref&gt; The second of five children, William Molyneux came from a relatively prosperous [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] background, with his father established at Castle Dillon in County Armagh, and his uncle Colonel Adam Molyneux holding large estates inherited from the Dowdall's in Ballymulvey, near [[Ballymahon]] in County [[Longford]]. He was close to his brother [[Sir Thomas Molyneux, 1st Baronet|Sir Thomas Molyneux]], with whom he later shared philosophical interests. His sister Jane married [[Anthony Dopping]], the eventual Anglican Bishop of Meath. In 1671 Molyneux started at [[Trinity College, Dublin]] where he became an avid reader of the leading figures of the [[Scientific Revolution]]. After attaining a Bachelor of Arts there, Molyneux was sent to study law in the [[Middle Temple]], London from 1675 to 1678. In 1678 he married Lucy Domville (?–1691), the youngest daughter of Sir [[Wiliam Domville]] the [[Attorney-General for Ireland]]. His wife became ill, which led to blindness after their marriage and died young. Of their 3 children, only [[Samuel Molyneux]] (1689–1728) lived past childhood. Samuel went on to become an [[astronomer]] and politician who worked with his father on various scientific endeavours.&lt;ref name="Bookrags"&gt;Science and Its Times via {{cite web|url=http://www.bookrags.com/William_Molyneux|title=William Molyneux Summary|accessdate=24 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career and publications ==
Because of his inheritance, Molyneux was financially independent.&lt;ref&gt;James G. O'Hara, 'Molyneux, William (1656–1698)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/18929, accessed 4 November 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, he held a number of official positions throughout his life. He was appointed [[Surveyor General of Ireland|Joint Surveyor General]] of the King's buildings and works in Ireland in 1684. In 1687 he invented a new type of sundial called a [[Sciothericum telescopicum]] that used special double [[gnomon]] and a telescope to measure the time of noon to within 15 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3mw1AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA213 Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, October 1686, No. 184 p. 213 et seq.]&lt;/ref&gt; He represented [[Dublin University (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Dublin University]] in Parliament from 1692 until his death. He had also served as a commissioner of forfeited estates in 1693, resigning a few months later due to ill health.

Meanwhile, Molyneux was responsible for a number of publications reflecting his diverse interests.  His first book was editing and translating into English the work of René Descartes which was published in London, 1680 as ''Six Metaphysical Meditations, Wherein it is Proved that there is a God...''. In 1682 Molyneux collaborated with [[Roderic O'Flaherty]] to collect material for [[Moses Pitt]]'s ''Atlas''. In 1685, Pitt's financial crisis lead to cancellation of the project but much valuable early Irish history had been collected. Molyneux struck a friendship with O'Flaherty and assisted when the latter's treatise ''Ogygia'' was published in London.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

Meanwhile, in October 1683 he founded the [[Dublin Philosophical Society]] along the lines of the [[Royal Society]] (of which Molyneux became a fellow in 1685), and became its first Secretary.&lt;ref&gt;

Theodore|last= Hoppen|journal=Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London|year=1963| pages= 125–135|volume=18|doi=10.1098/rsnr.1963.0016|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|jstor=531268|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was active in the proceedings of the society—recording weather data, calculating eclipses and demonstrating instruments and experiments.&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;James G. O'Hara, 'Molyneux, William (1656–1698)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edn, Jan 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Molyneux also published several papers in Philosophical Transactions, as well as papers on optics, natural philosophy, and miscellaneous topics.&lt;ref name="galileo.rice.edu"&gt;http://galileo.rice.edu/Catalog/NewFiles/molyneux.html&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps his best known scientific work was ''Dioptrica Nova, A treatise of dioptricks in two parts, wherein the various effects and appearances of spherick glasses, both convex and concave, single and combined, in telescopes and microscopes, together with their usefulness in many concerns of humane life, are explained'', published in London 1692.&lt;ref name="galileo.rice.edu"/&gt;  

After [[John Locke]] published his ''[[Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1690), Molyneux wrote to him praising the work.

Early in 1698, Molyneux published ''[[The Case of Ireland's being Bound by Acts of Parliament in England, Stated]]''.  This controversial&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; work—through application of historical and legal precedent—dealt with contentious constitutional issues that had emerged in the latter years of the seventeenth century as a result of attempts on the part of the English Parliament to pass laws that would suppress the Irish woolen trade.  It also dealt with the disputed appellate jurisdiction of the Irish House of Lords.  Molyneux's arguments reflected those made in an unpublished piece written by his father-in-law Sir William Domville, entitled ''A Disquisition Touching That Great Question Whether an Act of Parliament Made in England Shall Bind the Kingdom and People of Ireland Without Their Allowance and Acceptance of Such Act in the Kingdom of Ireland''.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Kelly.  'Sir William Domville, A Disquisition Touching That Great Question...', ''Analecta Hibernica'', no. 40 (2007): 19–69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a debate in the English House of Commons, it was resolved that Molyneux's publication was 'of dangerous consequence to the crown and people of England by denying the authority of the king and parliament of England to bind the kingdom and people of Ireland'.&lt;ref&gt;James G. O'Hara, 'Molyneux, William (1656–1698)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/18929, accessed 29 Feb 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite condemnation in England, Molyneux was not punished but his work was condemned as seditious and was ceremonially burned at Tyburn by the public hangman. His arguments remained topical in Ireland as constitutional issues arose throughout the eighteenth century, and formed part of Swift's argument in ''[[Drapier's Letters]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, Oliver W. ''Jonathan Swift and Ireland'' p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; The tract also gained attention in the [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonies]] as they moved towards independence.  Although ''The Case of Ireland, Stated'' was later associated with independence movements—both in Ireland and America—as one historian points out, 'Molyneux's constitutional arguments can easily be misinterpreted' and he was 'in no sense a separatist'.&lt;ref&gt;David Dickson, ''New Foundations: Ireland 1660–1800'' (Dublin, 2000), 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
Molyneux also proposed the philosophical question that has since become known as [[Molyneux's Problem]], which Locke discussed in later editions of the ''Essay''. The problem of the blind man who gains sight, which he proposed to Locke, remains a topic that is discussed into the 21st Century. &lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=r70IEreOL-wC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA319&amp;dq=gareth+evans+molyneux+problem&amp;ots=wf4KQSXOsb&amp;sig=HqWM6-fyxCz8xuujMMy0yLsqNf8#v=onepage&amp;q=gareth%20evans%20molyneux%20problem&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;The [[University Philosophical Society]] of [[Trinity College, Dublin]] views itself as the successor of the Dublin Philosophical Society, and thus recognises Molyneux as its founder and first president. Molyneux died in Dublin on 11 October 1698 and was buried in [[St. Audoen's Church, Dublin (Church of Ireland)|St. Audoen's Church]], within the burial vault of his great-grandfather, Sir William Ussher.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7733">'''William Robin Thompson''' (June 29, 1887 - January 30, 1972) was a Canadian [[Entomology|entomologist]] and [[philosopher]].

==Career==

Thompson was born in [[London, Ontario]]. After studying biology at the [[University of Toronto]], he obtained a [[Bachelor of Science|B.S]] in 1909 and started working at the [[United States Department of Agriculture]]. During his employment there, he continued to study at [[Cornell University]] and received his master's degree in entomology in 1912.&lt;ref name ="Israel"&gt;Israel, Giorgio; Gasca, Ana M. (2002). ''The Biology of Numbers: The Correspondence of Vito Volterra on Mathematical Biology''. Basel: Birkhauser Verlag. pp. 368-369. {{ISBN|978-3-0348-9447-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, he resigned from the Department of Agriculture to conduct research at [[University of Cambridge]] during 1914-1915. He then pursued his research at the European Parasite Laboratory in 1919 and graduated in 1921 which a doctorate in zoology at [[University of Paris]]. In 1924 he obtained another doctorate, this time in philosophy at St. Maximin College in France.&lt;ref name="Thorpe"&gt;Thorpe, W. H. (1973). [http://rsbm.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/roybiogmem/19/655 ''William Robin Thompson, 1887-1972'']. ''[[Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society]]'' 19: 655-678.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, Thompson left France and became assistant director of the Imperial Institute of Entomology in Britain, a service he held until 1947 when he returned to Canada.&lt;ref name ="Israel"/&gt; He became a professor at the Institute of Civil Service of Canada in 1949. Thompson was Director of the Commonwealth Institute of Biological Control in Ottawa (1946-1958).&lt;ref&gt;Coppel, H. C; Mertins, J. W. (1977). ''Biological Insect Pest Suppression''. [[Springer Publishing]]. p. 31. {{ISBN|978-3-642-66489-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1933.

Thompson published about 150 articles in various scientific journals. Between 1947 and 1958 he was editor of the magazine ''[[The Canadian Entomologist]]''.&lt;ref name ="Israel"/&gt; He died in [[Ottawa]].

==Evolution==

Thompson was a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] who held [[Alternatives to evolution by natural selection|anti-Darwinian]] views. He was influenced by the philosophical writings of [[Aristotle]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref name="Thorpe"/&gt; He wrote the critical 16-page introduction for the 1956 Everyman Edition of Charles Darwin's ''[[The Origin of Species]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hoppé, A. J. (1960). ''The Reader's Guide to Everyman's Library''. [[Everyman's Library|Dent]]. p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kohler"&gt;Kohler, Michèle; Kohler, Chris. (2009). ''The Origin of Species as a Book''. In [[Michael Ruse]], [[Robert J. Richards]]. (2009). ''The Cambridge Companion to the Origin of Species''. [[Cambridge University Press]]. p. 338. {{ISBN|978-0-521-87079-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; His introduction was reprinted by the [[Evolution Protest Movement]] in 1967.&lt;ref name="Kohler"/&gt; Thompson rejected [[natural selection]]. Historian of science Sharon E. Kingsland has noted that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Thompson believed that all species possessed an essence, or form, in the strict Aristotelian sense, which could not be changed by material means. He had a strong aversion to the hypothesis that all adapted types had been produced by the random actions of mutation and natural selection. Such random processes might explain microevolution, but they could not explain macroevolution. Thompson could not suggest an alternative hypothesis for the ones he had rejected; he simply regarded evolution as an unsolved problem."&lt;ref name="Kingsland"&gt;Kingsland, Sharon E. (1995). ''Modeling Nature''. [[University of Chicago Press]]. pp. 136-142. {{ISBN|0-226-43728-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thompson also rejected [[theistic evolution]] and was critical of the ideas of [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]]. In his book ''Science and Common Sense'', he wrote that "there has been ''some'' evolution, but we cannot decide upon a ''priori'' principles how much. Natural science has no key to this problem."&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, Ralph E. (1938). ''Reviewed Work: Science and Common Sense: An Aristotelian Excursion by W. R. Thompson''. ''[[Philosophy (journal)|Philosophy]]'' 13 (52): 501-503.&lt;/ref&gt; Biologist [[E. S. Russell]] noted that Thompson treated the philosophy of living organisms from an Aristotelian standpoint.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, E. S. (1938). ''Reviewed Work: Science and Common Sense : An Aristotelian Excursion by W. R. Thompson, Jacques Maritain''. ''Science Progress'' 33 (129): 193-194.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical biology==

After reading D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson's ''[[On Growth and Form]]'', he became interested in the possible application of [[Mathematical and theoretical biology|mathematics to biology]].&lt;ref name ="Israel"/&gt; This view was unpopular at the time amongst American and Canadian biologists. In the 1920s he was influenced by the work of mathematician [[Vito Volterra]].&lt;ref name ="Israel"/&gt; Thompson has been described as "one of the pioneers of mathematical modeling in ecology", but later became a staunch critic of it.&lt;ref&gt;Floyd, R. B; Sheppard, Andrew Walter; Joseph De Barro, Paul. (1996). ''Frontiers of Population Ecology''. CSIRO Publishing. p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s, Thompson radically changed his opinions about the use of mathematics in biology, believing the association was strongly negative.&lt;ref name ="Israel"/&gt; This was largely due to the work on [[population genetics]] by [[J. B. S. Haldane]] and [[Ronald Fisher]] which he believed was too abstract and devoid
of common sense and empirical facts.&lt;ref name ="Israel"/&gt; Thompson was concerned that many of the arguments from mathematical biology were not based on biological observation. He believed that mathematical speculation should not replace the study of nature through laborious field research.&lt;ref name="Kingsland"/&gt;

Thompson outlined his views on mathematics, philosophy and science in his book ''Science and Common Sense: An Aristotelian Excursion'' (1937).&lt;ref name="Kingsland"/&gt;

==Systematics==

Thompson wrote papers on the [[species problem]] and [[systematics]]. In a 1952 paper he argued against the reality of [[species]] based on his opinion that the species taxon is an "abstraction" taken from the features of many individuals but species themselves are not "the individual or the collectivity of individuals."&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Andrew. (2014). ''The Evolution of Phylogenetic Systematics''. [[University of California Press]]. p. 105. {{ISBN|978-0-520-27658-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
