'''''A Universe of Consciousness: How Matter Becomes Imagination''''' is the title of a 2000 [[book]] by [[biologists]] [[Gerald Edelman|Gerald Maurice Edelman]] and [[Giulio Tononi]];&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Universe_of_Consciousness.html?id=SCntU3_BmtUC A Universe of Consciousness: How Matter Becomes Imagination] at google books, retrieved 28 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt; published in UK as '''Consciousness: How Matter Becomes Imagination'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Consciousness|publisher=Penguin|url=https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/25057/consciousness/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This book, written with Giulio Tononi, is the culmination of a series of works by Gerald Edelman on the workings of the brain which include [[Neural Darwinism]] and Bright Air, Brilliant Fire.

==Precis==
It is divided into six sections: the first three cover existing work from philosophical, neurological and Darwinian perspectives. Part IV presents the novel thesis of the work: the Dynamic Core Hypothesis. The remaining two parts explore how it resolves various philosophical and practical issues.

===The Background===
Since [[Descartes]], philosophers have been occupied with the concept of [[consciousness]] and its subjective nature has posed a special problem for science. Its nature arises from the [[Neuron|neuronal structures]] in the brain and some understanding of these, together with the experimental tools needed to explore them, is given in the following chapters. They then recapitulate Edelman's still controversial theory of [[Neural Darwinism|somatic selectionism]] during early development which controls the topology of a particular brain and enables restructuring in response to experience. They argue that memory is not a [[Symbolic system|symbolic representation]] but a reflection of how the brain has changed its dynamics in order to achieve motor activity. This leads to a discussion of primary consciousness which integrates with perception into a means of directing immediate [[behavior]] and requires significant levels of [[Reentry (neural circuitry)|reentrancy]] to achieve its effects.

===The Dynamic Core Hypothesis===
The problem of integrating, or ''binding'', the activity of functionally segregated areas of the brain in order to concentrate attention on a particular activity in a short amount of time (typically 100-250 msecs) after the presentation of a stimulus is explored by means of large-scale [[simulation]]s. It is shown that this can only happen if some elements interact more strongly among themselves than with the rest of the system including a large amount of reentrancy. These ''functional clusters'' are only slowly coming into the range of [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] or [[fMRI]] scanning technology which commonly require much longer time scales.

At any given time, only a small subset of the neuronal groups in the brain are contributing directly to consciousness and this cluster is called a ''dynamic core''. It represents a single point of view and each different state of consciousness corresponds to a different subset. Some dissociative disorders such as schizophrenia may result in the formation of multiple cores.

===Implications of the hypothesis===
One of the recurring issues in consciousness is the existence of ''[[qualia]]'', such as redness, warmth and pain. It is not enough to identify each quale with a particular neuron or neuronal group; what is crucial is all the other groups which are highly influenced by the sensation and will fire at the same time. Thus each conscious state deserves to be called a quale. A small perturbation of a group of neurons can affect the whole in a very short space of time provided the system is kept in a state of readiness by the thalamus. Primary consciousness can build up a bodily based reference space even before language and higher-order consciousness appear.

There is a preliminary approach to the relationship between conscious and unconscious processes, including sensors and motors, because so little is known
The evolution of language centres in the brain leads to higher order consciousness which enhances subjective experience and enables humans to describe qualia which are however experienced by a much wider range of animals. Thinking in humans has a range of representations—including pictorial. In contrast to computers which are [[Turing machine]]s, brains are based on [[neuronal group selection]].

==Reviews==

John Cornwell (Sunday Times) One of the most thoughtful books on the topic... While revealing much that is surprising about consciousness, they confirm some deeply held convictions about the power and mystery of human imagination.

Piero Scaruffi: The book advances a theory for what causes the conscious feeling that we experience, but fails to explain how matter can turn into feelings. For all the properties of consciousness that they list, the authors fail to grasp the essence of consciousness: I "feel" that I am myself. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Universe of Consciousness|first=Piero|last=Scaruffi|year=2000| url=https://www.scaruffi.com/mind/edelman5.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The results of this pioneering work challenge the conventional wisdom about consciousness.

The '''Association for Chemoreception Sciences''' is an international [[professional society]] in the field of [[chemosensory|chemosensory science]].  It is a [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit organization]] that seeks to promote and advance the interests of the science of senses such as [[taste]] and [[Olfaction|smell]].{{r|enc|page=32}} In order to do this, it holds an annual meeting that is a scientific forum&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cst.ufl.edu/tag/news-briefs|title=Center for Smell and Taste   » News Briefs|website=cst.ufl.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the research community&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/422198417|title=29 Sep 1979, 127 - The Gazette at Newspapers.com|work=Newspapers.com|access-date=2018-07-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.fifthsense.org.uk/fifth-senses-duncan-boak-at-achems-2016-meeting-blog-post-1/|title=21 Apr 2016 - Fifth Sense's Duncan Boak At AChemS 2016 Meeting|access-date=2018-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also provides outreach to the public about [[olfaction]] (smell) and [[Taste|gustation]] (taste). 

The association was founded in 1978 by Maxwell M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26679">In recent years, the use of biologically inspired methods such as the [[evolutionary algorithm]] have been increasingly employed to solve and analyze complex computational problems. '''BELBIC''' (Brain Emotional Learning Based Intelligent Controller) is one such [[Controller (control theory)|controller]] which is proposed by [[Caro Lucas]], Danial Shahmirzadi and Nima Sheikholeslami and adopts the network model developed by [[Jan Morén|Moren]] and [[Balkenius]] to mimic those parts of the brain which are known to produce emotion (namely, the [[amygdala]], [[orbitofrontal cortex]], [[thalamus]] and sensory input cortex).&lt;ref name="Lucas"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Lucas | first1 = C. | last2 = Shahmirzadi | first2 = D. | last3 = Sheikholeslami | first3 = N.| year = 2004 | title = Introducing BELBIC: Brain Emotional Learning Based Intelligent Controller | journal = Intelligent Automation and Soft Computing | volume = 10| pages = 11–22 | doi=10.1080/10798587.2004.10642862}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Emotions and learning ==

Traditionally, the study of learning in biological systems was conducted at the expense of overlooking its lesser known counterparts: [[motivation]] and [[emotion]]. However these phenomena can not be separated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = LeDoux | first = J. E. | editor = Gazzaniga, M. S | title = The Cognitive Neurosciences | year = 1995 | publisher = Lawrence Erlbaum | location = Hillsdale, NJ  | pages = 1049–1061 | chapter = In Search of an Emotional System in the Brain: Leaping from Fear to Emotion and Consciousness}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motivation is the drive that causes any system to do anything – without it, there is no reason to act. Emotions indicate how successful a course of actions have been and whether another set of actions should have been taken instead – they are a constant feedback to the learning system. Learning on the other hand, guarantees that motivation and emotional subsystems are able to adapt to constantly changing conditions.&lt;ref name = "LeDoux"&gt;{{Citation | author = LeDoux, J.E. | year = 1996 | title = The Emotional Brain| publisher = Simon and Schuster, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, in the study of biological organisms, emotions have arisen to prominence as an integral part of any biologically inspired system. But how does any living organism benefit from its emotions? It is crucial to answer this question as we attempt to increasingly employ biologically inspired methods in solving computational problems.

Every creature has innate abilities that accommodate its survival in the world. It can identify food, shelter, partners, and danger. But these "simple mappings between stimuli and reactions will not be enough to keep the organisms from encountering problems."&lt;ref name = "Moren"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Moren |first=Jan |title= Thesis: Emotion and Learning | publisher= Lund University |year= 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a given animal knows that its predator has qualities A, B and C, it will escape ''all'' creatures that have those qualities. And thus waste much of its energy and resources on non-existent danger.

We can not expect evolution to provide more advanced algorithms for assessing danger, because the predator is also evolving at the same speed. Thus, biological systems need to be equipped with the ability to learn. This learning and re-learning mechanism allows them to adapt to highly complex and advanced situations.&lt;ref name = "LeDoux" /&gt;

[[Image:LearningOrganism.JPG|frame|right|A Learning Organism]]To learn effectively, every learning organism needs an evaluation of the current situation and also feedback on how beneficial the results of learning were.&lt;ref name = "Moren" /&gt; On the most part, these evaluation mechanisms are built-in. And so we encounter a new problem: whereas creatures take appropriate measures in real time based on their evaluations, these built-in evaluation procedures are developed in evolutionary time. But all creatures need to learn of new evaluation techniques in their lifetime just as they learn the proper reactions.

This is where the ability to condition emotional reactions comes into play. Biological organisms associate innate emotional stimuli with other stimuli they encounter in the world and thus give them an emotional significance when needed.&lt;ref name = "Moren" /&gt; These evaluations can be monitored to operate at very specific times, specific places or when accompanied by other specific stimuli.

There is another reason why these observations are so significant and that is the creation of artificial systems. These systems do not evolve over time but are designed with certain abilities from the start. Thus, their adaptability must be built-in.

==Computational model==

[[Image:Brain limbicsystem.jpg|frame|right |The Brain Limbic System]]
[[Image:Amyg.png|frame|right |The Amygdala in the Human Brain]]

A [[Scientific modelling|model]] is a simplified description of a phenomenon. It brings to life some aspects of this phenomenon while overlooking others. What aspects are kept in the model and what are overlooked greatly depends on the topic of study. Thus, the nature of a model depends on the purpose the investigator plans to carry out. A computational model is one which can be mathematically analyzed, tested and simulated using computer systems.&lt;ref name = "Moren" /&gt;

To construct a computational model of emotional learning in the brain requires a thorough analysis of the [[amygdala]]  and the [[orbitofrontal cortex]] and the interaction between them:&lt;ref name = "MB"&gt;{{Citation | first = J. | last = Moren | author2 = Balkenius, C. | title = A Computational Model of Emotional Learning in the Amygdala | conference = Proc. 6th International Conference on the Simulation of Adaptive Behavior, Cambridge, Mass. | publisher = MIT Press | year = 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mammals, emotional responses are processed in a part of the brain called the [[limbic system]] which lies in the [[cerebral cortex]]. The main components of the limbic system are the [[amygdala]], [[orbitofrontal cortex]], [[thalamus]] and the sensory cortex.

The amygdala is an almond shaped area which is placed such that it can communicate with all other cortices within the limbic system. The primary affective conditioning of the system occurs within the amygdala. That is, the association between a stimulus and its emotional consequence takes place in this region.&lt;ref name = "Moren" /&gt;

It has been suggested that learning takes place in two fundamental steps.&lt;ref name = "Mower"&gt;{{Citation | last = Mower | first = O. H. | title = Learning Theory and Behavior | publisher = Wiley | origyear = 1960| year = 1973 | location = New York }}&lt;/ref&gt; First, a particular stimulus is correlated with an emotional response. This stimulus can be an endless number of phenomena from observing a face, to detecting a scent, hearing a noise, etc. Second, this emotional consequence shapes an association between the stimulus and the response.&lt;ref name = "Mower" /&gt; This analysis is quite influential in part because it was one of the first to suggest that emotions play a key part in learning.&lt;ref name = "MB" /&gt; In more recent studies, it has been shown that the association between a stimulus and its emotional consequence take place in the amygdala.&lt;ref name = "LeDoux" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Rolls"&gt;{{Citation | last = Rolls | first = E. T. | editor = Gazzaniga, M. S. | title = The Cognitive Neurosciences | year = 1995 | publisher = Lawrence Erlbaum | location = Hillsdale, NJ  | pages = 127–155 | chapter = A theory of Emotion and Consciousness, and its Application to Understanding the Neural Basis of Emotion}}&lt;/ref&gt; "In this region, highly analyzed stimulus representations in the cortex are associated with an emotional value. Therefore, emotions are properties of stimuli".&lt;ref name = "MB" /&gt;

The task of the amygdala is thus to assign a primary emotional value to each stimulus that has been paired with a primary reinforcer&lt;ref name = "Rolls" /&gt; – the reinforcer is the reward and punishment that the mammal receives. This task is aided by the orbitofrontal complex. "In terms of learning theory, the amygdala appears to handle the presentation of primary reinforcement, while the orbitofrontal cortex is involved in the detection of omission of reinforcement."&lt;ref name = "MB" /&gt;

The first thing we notice in the computational model developed by [[Jan Morén|Moren]] and [[Balkenius]] is that quite a number of interacting learning systems exist in the brain that deal with emotional learning. The computational model is presented below where:

* '''''Th''''' : Thalamus
* '''''CX''''' : Sensory Cortex
* '''''A'''''  : Input structures in the amygdala
* '''''E'''''  : Output structures in the amygdala
* '''''O'''''  : Orbitofrontal Cortex
* '''''Rew/Pun''''' : External signals identifying the presentation of reward and punishment
* '''''CR/UR'''''   : conditioned response/unconditioned response
* '''''V'''''  : Associative strength from cortical representation to the amygdala that is changed by learning
* '''''W'''''  : Inhibitory connection from orbitofrontal cortex to the amygdala that is changed during learning

&lt;Center&gt;
[[Image:Computational Model of Emotional Learning2.JPG]]
&lt;/Center&gt;

This image shows that the sensory input enters through the thalamus '''''TH'''''. In biological systems, the thalamus takes on the task of initiating the process of a response to stimuli. It does so by passing the signal to the amygdala and the sensory cortex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Kelly | first = J. P. | title = The Neural Basis of Perception and Movement, Principles of Neural Science | publisher =  Prentice Hall | year = 1991 | location = London }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This signal is then analyzed in the cortical area – '''''CX'''''. In biological systems, the sensory cortex operates by distributing the incoming signals appropriately between the amygdala and the orbitofrontal cortex.&lt;ref name = "Dan"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Shahmirzadi, D. | title = Thesis: Computational Modeling of the Brain Limbic System and its Application in Control Engineering | publisher = Texas A &amp; M University | year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sensory representation in '''''CX''''' is then sent to the amygdala '''''A''''', through the pathway '''''V'''''.

This is the main pathway for learning in this model. Reward and punishment enter the amygdala to strengthen the connection between the amygdala and the pathway. At a later stage if a similar representation is activated in the cortex, '''''E''''' becomes activated and produces an emotional response.

'''''O''''', the orbitofrontal cortex, operates based on the difference between the ''perceived'' (i.e. expected) reward/punishment and the actual ''received'' reward/punishment. This perceived reward/punishment is the one that has been developed in the brain over time using learning mechanisms and it reaches the orbitofrontal cortex via the sensory cortex and the amygdala. The received reward/punishment on the other hand, comes courtesy of the outside world and is the ''actual'' reward/punishment that the specie has just obtained. If these two are identical, the output is the same as always through '''''E'''''. If not, the orbitofronal cortex inhibits and restrains emotional response to make way for further learning. So the path '''''W''''' is only activated in such conditions.

== Controller ==

In most industrial processes that contain complex nonlinearities, control [[algorithms]] are used to create [[Linearization|linearized]] models.&lt;ref name = "Rouhani"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Rouhani | first1 = H. | last2 = Jalili | first2 = M. | last3 = Araabi | first3 = B. N. | last4 = Eppler | first4 = W. | last5 = Lucas | first5 = C. | year = 2006 | title = Brain Emotional Learning Based Intelligent Controller Applied to Neurofuzzy Model of Micro-Heat Exchanger | journal = Expert Systems with Applications | volume = 32 | pages = 911–918 | doi = 10.1016/j.eswa.2006.01.047 | issue = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One reason is that these linear models are developed using straightforward methods from process test data.

However, if the process is highly complex and nonlinear, subject to frequent disturbances, a nonlinear model will be required.&lt;ref name = "Rouhani" /&gt; Biologically motivated intelligent controllers have been increasingly employed in these situations. Amongst them, [[fuzzy logic]], [[neural networks]] and [[genetic algorithms]] are some of the most widely employed tools in control applications with highly complex, nonlinear settings.&lt;ref name = "Mehr"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Mehrabian | first1 = A. R. | last2 = Lucas | first2 = C. | year = 2007 | title = Intelligent Adaptive Control of Non-Linear Systems Based on Emotional Learning Approach | journal = International Journal on Artificial Intelligence Tools | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages = 69–85 | doi = 10.1142/S0218213007003205 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Mehr2" /&gt;

BELBIC is one such nonlinear [[Controller (control theory)|controller]] – a [[neuromorphic]] controller based on the computational learning model shown [[:Image:Computational Model of Emotional Learning2.JPG|above]] to produce the control action. This model is employed much like an algorithm in these control engineering applications. In these new approaches, intelligence is not ''given'' to the system from the outside but is actually acquired by the system itself.&lt;ref name = "Lucas" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Rouhani" /&gt;

This simple model has been employed as a [[feedback]] [[Controller (control theory)|controller]] to be applied to control design problems. One logic behind this use in control engineering is a belief held by many experts in the field that there has been too much focus on fully rational deliberative approaches, whereas in many real-world circumstances, we are only provided with a bounded rationality. Factors like computational complexity, multiplicity of objectives and prevalence of uncertainty lead to a desire to obtain more ad-hoc, rule-of-thumb approaches. Emotional decision making is highly capable of addressing these issues because it is neither fully cognitive nor fully behavioral.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Mehrabian | first1 = A. R. | last2 = Lucas | first2 = C. | last3 = Roshanian | first3 = J. | year = 2006 | title = Aerospace Launch Vehicle Control: An Intelligent Adaptive Approach | journal = Aerospace Science and Technology | volume = 10 | pages = 149–155 | doi = 10.1016/j.ast.2005.11.002 | issue = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BELBIC, which is a model free controller, suffers from the same drawback of all intelligent model free controllers: it cannot be applied on unstable systems or systems with unstable equilibrium point. This is a natural result of the trial and error manner of the learning procedure, i.e. exploration for finding the appropriate control signals can lead to instability.&lt;ref name="Roshtkhari2010"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Javan Roshtkhari| first1 = M. | last2 = Arami | first2 = A. | last3 = Lucas | first3 = C. | year = 2010 | title = Imitative Learning Based Emotional Controller for Unknown Systems with Unstable Equilibrium | journal = International Journal of Intelligent Computing and Cybernetics | volume = 2 | pages = 334–359 | url=http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~javan/Imitative%20learning%20based%20emotional%20controller%20for%20unknown%20systems%20with%20unstable%20equilibrium.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Roshtkhari2009"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Javan Roshtkhari| first1 = M. | last2 = Arami | first2 = A. | last3 = Lucas | first3 = C. | year = 2009 | title = Emotional Control of Inverted Pendulum System, A soft switching from Imitative to emotional learning | conference= The 4th International Conference on Autonomous Robots and Agents (ICARA 09) | pages = 651–656}}&lt;/ref&gt; By integrating [[imitative learning]] and [[Fuzzy logic|fuzzy inference systems]], BELBIC is generalized in order to be capable of controlling unstable systems.&lt;ref name = "Roshtkhari2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Roshtkhari2009" /&gt;

'''''Bad Science''''' is a book by [[Ben Goldacre]], criticising mainstream media reporting on health and science issues. It was published by [[Eos (imprint)|Fourth Estate]] in September 2008.&lt;ref name=book&gt;{{cite book |last=Goldacre |first=Ben |title= Bad Science|date=September 2008 |publisher=[[Eos (imprint)|Fourth Estate]] |location=London |language= |isbn=978-0-00-724019-7 |oclc= 259713114}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been positively reviewed by the ''[[British Medical Journal]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Richard Smith |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/extract/337/oct01_3/a1856 |title=Becoming Ben - Smith 337 |publisher=bmj.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Daily Telegraph''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/non_fictionreviews/3561272/Review-Bad-Science-by-Ben-Goldacre.html "Ed Lake applauds a crusade against lazy and deceptive writing about science"]&lt;/ref&gt; and has reached the Top 10 bestseller list for Amazon Books. It was shortlisted for the 2009 [[Samuel Johnson Prize]]. Bad Science or '''BadScience''' is also the title of Goldacre's column in ''[[The Guardian]]'' and his website.

==Contents==

===Introduction===
A brief introduction (by Goldacre) touching on subjects covered by subsequent chapters. It bemoans the widespread lack of understanding of evidence-based science.

===Chapter 1: Matter===
Chapter 1 is entitled Matter, but is really concerned with the modern trend for [[Detoxification (alternative medicine)|Detoxification]]. Goldacre looks at three supposed detox treatments: aqua detox (a footbath detox), Hopi Ear Candles, and detox patches. Each of these so-called treatments is intended to remove toxins and impurities from the body. 

According to Goldacre, the manufacturers of these detox remedies are unable or unwilling to state which toxins exactly are being removed from the body. Goldacre debunks the claims made for each of these products and says that the whole idea of detox is an invention. There are no such toxins floating around the body in excessive quantities, waiting to be removed by detox treatments. 

Goldacre has no problem with the idea of someone choosing to give their body a rest after overindulging, say. That is just common sense. But he sees detox treatments as the modern equivalent of religious rituals of purifcation or abstinence. Clearly, such rituals fill a human need in some way - Goldacre has no problem with that. What is wrong, however, is to pretend that these detox rituals are based in science. They are not. At worst, they are supposed quick-fixes that distract from the genuine lifestyle risk factors for ill health that affect us over the long term.

===Chapter 2: Brain Gym===
[[Brain Gym]] is a set of exercises and activities that are supposed to 'enhance the experience of whole brain learning'. At the time when Goldacre’s book was written, [[Brain Gym]] was promoted by the Department for Education and used in hundreds of state schools across the country. But Goldacre says this is pseudoscience dressed up in clever long phrases and jargon. He goes on to describe a 2008 study that suggested that people will tend to believe a bad explanation written in sciencey terms, rather than a good explanation that isn't decorated with sciencey words.

Some of the underlying ideas in [[Brain Gym]] are sensible: regular breaks, intermittent light exercise and drinking plenty of water are likely to help children learn. But Goldacre sees the pseudoscientific explanation around it (such as the 26 special movements and the ‘brain buttons’ concept) as an attempt to 'proprietorialise' common sense. That is, turn it into something that you can patent, own, sell and make profit from. He sees this trend particularly strongly among nutritionists. The corrosive side effect of this ‘privatisation of common sense’ is that we become dependent on outside systems and people, instead of taking control ourselves.

===Chapter 3: The Progenium XY Complex===
In this short chapter, Goldacre looks at cosmetics - specifically, moisturisers. According to Goldacre, expensive moisturisers tend to contain three groups of ingredients: powerful chemicals that ''were'' effective in making skin look younger, before they had to be watered down because of their side effects; vegetable protein, which does actually shrink wrinkles temporarily; and esoteric chemicals that are meant to 'make you believe that all sorts of claims are being made'. But the manufacturers are very careful to claim only that the moisturiser as a whole will have beneficial effects - they don't make specific claims about their 'magic ingredients', because such claims could be easily challenged by the regulator.

Instead, the magic ingredients (such as the made-up Progenium XY Complex) are only included to make it sound like some complicated science is involved. And that is Goldacre's main complaint: The cosmetics companies sell their products by appealing to the misleading idea that science is complicated, incomprehensible, and impenetrable. This is bad because the target audience who are bombarded with this dubious world view are young women, a group who are under-represented in science.

===Chapter 4: Homeopathy===
Goldacre provides an overview of the origins of [[Homeopathy]] (its ‘invention’ by [[Samuel Hahnemann]] in the late eighteenth century) and the basic ideas that characterise it: ‘like cures like’, the increase in potency by [[homeopathic dilutions|dilution]], succussion, proving, and the collation of remedies in a reference book. He shows that the levels of dilution used in preparing homeopathic remedies are so high, that the final ‘medicine’ contains no active ingredient. He dismisses the idea of ‘[[water memory]]’, which has been used in more recent times to explain why homeopathic remedies still work, in spite of extreme dilution.

As far as Goldacre is concerned, it’s fine if someone wants to take a [[homeopathic remedy]] because ‘it made me feel better last time’. However, the experience of an individual (or a small group of people) cannot be used to as a basis for saying that homeopathy works or that it is science. First of all, an individual can have no way of knowing if they got better because of the homeopathic remedy they took, the placebo effect or [[regression to the mean]] (that is, the natural cycle of the disease). Secondly, homeopathic remedies should be subjected to a ‘fair test’: a [[placebo-controlled trial]]. In fact, such tests have been carried out for homeopathic remedies and it has been shown that they are no better than placebo.

Goldacre says that some individual trials have shown that a homeopathic remedy works. But usually these trials are found to have methodological flaws. Typical problems with these trials have included a poor quality approach to blinding or randomisation. Another problem is that trials of homeopathic remedies often don’t provide full information about the methods used. Poor quality research studies tend to exaggerate positive results. Goldacre provides a summary of a paper by Ernst et al, which suggested that this has occurred in studies of homeopathic [[arnica]]. That said, Goldacre does concede that the overall experience of going to see a homeopath does seem to have a positive effect on some patients, and that would be worth investigating further.

What we really need, says Goldacre, is [[meta-analyses]]. This is when the results of smaller research studies are pooled and analysed together as a single group. The [[Cochrane Collaboration]] was set up to carry out systematic reviews and meta-analyses. A landmark study by Shang et al (2005), which looked at a vast number of homeopathic trials, again found that homeopathic remedies perform no better than placebo. 

Goldacre criticises the homeopathic community for their lack of understanding of how to carry out high quality research, their lack of openness and transparency, their unwillingness to submit their research to full and proper scrutiny, their rejection of justified academic criticism and their overall aggressiveness. Using the specific example of an interview with Elizabeth Thompson, he illustrates how homeopaths will use nuanced language to avoid actually admitting that their pills don’t work.

===Chapter 5: The Placebo Effect===
Examples of the power of the mind over pain, anxiety and depression are presented with studies showing how higher prices, fancy packaging, theatrical procedures and a confident attitude in the doctor all contribute to the relief of symptoms. In patients with no specific diagnosed condition, even a fake [[diagnosis]] and [[prognosis]] with no other treatment helps recovery, but ethical and time constraints usually prevent doctors from giving this reassurance. Exploiting the [[placebo]] effect is presented as possibly justifiable if used in conjunction with effective conventional treatments. The author links its use by alternative medicine practitioners with the diversion of patients away from effective treatments and the undermining of public health campaigns on AIDS and [[malaria]].

===Chapter 6: The Nonsense ''du Jour''===
[[nutritionism|Nutritionists]] are accused of misusing science and mystifying diet to bamboozle the public. Misrepresentations of the results of legitimate scientific research to lend bogus authority to nutritionist theories, while ignoring alternative explanations are cited in evidence. The use of weak circumstantial associations between diet and health found in observational studies as if they proved nutritionist claims is criticised. The unjustified over-interpretation of [[Surrogate endpoint|surrogate outcomes]] in animal (or [[tissue culture]]) experiments as proving human health benefits is explored. The [[Cherry picking (fallacy)|cherry picking]] of published research to support a favoured view is contrasted with the [[systematic review]] designed to minimise such bias. The supposed benefits of [[antioxidants]] are questioned with studies showing they may be ineffective or even harmful in some cases. The methods used by the [[food supplement]] industry to manufacture doubt about any critical scientific reports are likened to those previously used by the tobacco and [[asbestos]]

===Chapter 7: Dr Gillian McKeith PhD===
The Scottish TV diet guru and self-styled "doctor" [[Gillian McKeith]] and her scientific claims are dissected. Statements exemplifying her scientific knowledge include that the consumption of dark-leaved vegetables like spinach "will really oxygenate your blood" as they are high in chlorophyll, and that "each sprouting seed is packed with the nutritional energy needed to create a fully-grown, healthy plant". She is described  masquerading as a genuine medical doctor on her TV reality/health shows. Her publications are compared with a Melanesian [[cargo cult]]; superficially correct but lacking any scientific substance. Her belief in the special nutritional value of plant enzymes (which are broken down in the gut like any other proteins) is ridiculed. The general problems involved in establishing any firm links between diet and health are examined.

===Chapter 8: 'Pill Solves Complex Social Problem'===
The claim that [[fish oil]] capsules make children smarter is examined. The book probes the methodological weaknesses of the widely publicised "Durham trial" where the pills were given to children to improve their school performance and behaviour, but without any [[control groups]] and wide open to a range of [[confounding|confounding factors]]. The failure to publish any results and backtracking on earlier claims by the education authorities is slated, with their refusal to divulge any data through [[Freedom of information in the United Kingdom | Freedom of Information Requests]] specifically mentioned. The media's preference for simple science stories and role in promoting  dubious health products is highlighted. Parallels are drawn between the [[Equazen]] company behind the Durham fish oil trials and the [[David Horrobin|Efamol]] company's promotion of [[evening primrose oil]].

===Chapter 9: Professor Patrick Holford===
The influence of the best-selling author, media commentator, businessman and founder of the [[Institute for Optimum Nutrition]] (which has trained most of the UK's "nutrition therapists") is acknowledged. [[Patrick Holford|Holford's]] success in presenting nutritionism as a scientific discipline in the media, and forging links with some British universities is also noted. The book judges that his success is based on misinterpreting and cherry-picking favourable results from the medical literature, in order to market his vitamin pills. His promotion of [[vitamin]] C in preference to [[Zidovudine|AZT]] as a treatment for AIDS, vitamin E to prevent heart attacks, and vitamin A to treat [[autism]] are all condemned as lacking in sound evidential support. His reliance on the work of discredited fellow nutritionist [[Ranjit Chandra|Dr. R.K. Chandra]] is likewise slated. The Universities of [[University of Luton|Luton]] and [[Teesside University|Teesside]] are criticised for their past associations with Holford and the [[Institute for Optimum Nutrition|ION]].

===Chapter 10: Is Mainstream Medicine Evil?===
The book remarks on the relatively low percentage of conventional medical activity (50 to 80%) which could be called "evidence-based". The efforts of the medical profession to weed out bad treatments are seen to be hampered by the withholding or distortion of evidence by drug companies. The science and economics of drug development are outlined, with criticism of the lack of independence of industrial research and the neglect of Third World diseases. Some underhand tricks  used by drug companies to engineer positive trial results for their products are explored. The [[publication bias]] produced by researchers not publishing negative results is illustrated with [[funnel plot]]s. Examples are made of the [[SSRI]] antidepressants and [[Vioxx]] drugs. Reform of trials registers to prevent abuses is proposed. The ethics of drug advertising and manipulation of patient advocacy groups are questioned.

===Chapter 11: How the Media Promote the Public Misunderstanding of Science===
The misrepresentation of science and scientists in the media is attributed to the preponderance of humanities graduates in journalism. The dumbing-down of science to produce easily assimilated wacky, breakthrough or scare stories is criticised. Wacky "formula stories" like those for "the perfect boiled egg" or [[Blue Monday (date)|"most depressing day of the year"]] are revealed to be the product of PR companies using biddable academics to add weight to their marketing campaigns. Among other examples, the speculation by [http://www2.lse.ac.uk/researchAndExpertise/Experts/departments.aspx?dept=18 Dr. Oliver Curry] (a political theorist at the [[London School of Economics|LSE]]) that the human race will evolve into two separate races, presented as a science story across the British media, is exposed as a PR stunt for a men's TV channel. The relative scarcity of sensational medical breakthroughs since a golden age of discovery between 1935 and 1975, is seen as motivating the production of dumbed-down stories which trumpet unpublished research and ill-founded speculation. An inability to evaluate the soundness of scientific evidence is seen to give undeserved prominence to marginal figures with fringe views.

===Chapter 12: Why Clever People Believe Stupid Things===
This chapter is a brief introduction to the research on [[cognitive bias]]es, which, Goldacre argues, explain some of the appeal of alternative medicine ideas. Biases mentioned include [[confirmation bias]], the [[availability heuristic]], [[illusory superiority]] and the [[clustering illusion]] (the misperception of random data). It also discusses [[Solomon Asch]]'s classic [[Asch conformity experiments|study of social conformity]].

===Chapter 13: Bad Stats===
This chapter covers the cases of [[Sally Clark]] and [[Lucia de Berk]], in which the author says poor understanding and presentation of statistics played an important part in their criminal trials.

===Chapter 14: Health Scares===
In this chapter, the author claims that the press selectively used a "laboratory" that gave positive [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]] results where other pathology labs found none. Creating an "expert" from Chris Malyszewicz who worked from a garden shed.

Goldacre notes how the Daily Mirror once managed to combine "three all-time classic bogus science stories" into one editorial:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mirror.co.uk/opinion/2004/07/11/blair-s-got-to-stay-on-and-finish-the-job-98487-14414071/ NO WAY TO TREAT A DEDICATED DOCTOR] The Sunday Mirror, 11 July 2004, Retrieved 13 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; the Arpad [[Pusztai affair]] of GM crops, [[Andrew Wakefield]] and the [[MMR vaccine controversy]] and Chris Malyszewicz and the [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]] hoax. On the other hand, journalists were very poor in uncovering or reporting on the [[thalidomide]] tragedy&lt;ref&gt;Knightley, Phillip [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/a-battle-won-late-1247236.html A battle won late] The Independent, 25 August 1997, Retrieved 13 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; - only covering well the ultimate political issue of compensation.

===Chapter 15: The Media's MMR Hoax===
[[Andrew Wakefield]] and the [[MMR vaccine controversy]]. The author continues to discuss the lab results in previous chapter and discusses the MRSA mix up in hospitals wrong patients get wrong results.

===Index===
The hardback and first paperback editions did not include an index. Several indexes were prepared by bloggers, including one prepared by Oliblog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oliolioli.wordpress.com/2009/01/09/bad-science-the-missing-index/ |title=Bad Science: the missing index « o_l_i_b_l_o_g |publisher=Oliolioli.wordpress.com |date=2009-01-09 |accessdate=2011-08-15| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110718103633/http://oliolioli.wordpress.com/2009/01/09/bad-science-the-missing-index/| archivedate= 18 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latest paperback issue includes a full index.

=== Previously unpublished chapter: "The Doctor Will Sue You Now" ===
Further to the release of this book a resolution of the legal status of one of the chapters has come about since Goldacre won a libel case filed against him by [[Matthias Rath]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.badscience.net/ |title=BadScience.net |publisher=Ben Goldacre |accessdate=2009-04-13 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090412000503/http://www.badscience.net/ |archivedate=12 April 2009 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; The post dated 9 April 2009 states: "This is the 'missing chapter' about vitamin pill salesman Matthias Rath. Sadly I was unable to write about him at the time that book was initially published, as he was suing my ass in the High Court."

The full chapter has been made universally available under a [[Creative Commons]] license with the title "The Doctor Will Sue You Now".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://badscience.net/files/The-Doctor-Will-Sue-You-Now.pdf| title=The-Doctor-Will-Sue-You-Now.pdf|publisher=Ben Goldacre|accessdate=2009-04-13| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090419073054/http://badscience.net/files/The-Doctor-Will-Sue-You-Now.pdf| archivedate= 19 April 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, this full chapter is included as chapter 10 in the New Paperback Edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Goldacre | first = Ben | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | year = 2009 | title = Bad Science, Paperback | publisher = Harper Perennial | location = UK | isbn = 0-00-728487-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this chapter the author explains its origin, its reasons for being excluded, and describes his personal reasons and tribulations in the said legal resolution. It contains an account of his anger at being gagged due to legal/financial restrictions, his support by the ''Guardian'' (for whom he writes) and his now encyclopedic knowledge of the subject in question.

'''Helen Beatrix Potter''' (British English {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|iː|ə|t|r|ɪ|k|s}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://howjsay.com/pronunciation-of-beatrix-potter#|title=Free online Dictionary of English Pronunciation - How to Pronounce English words|website=howjsay.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; North American English also {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|iː|t|r|ɪ|k|s}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/beatrix-potter?q=Beatrix|title=beatrix-potter  - Definition, pictures, pronunciation and usage notes - Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary at OxfordLearnersDictionaries.com|website=www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 28 July 1866{{spaced ndash}}22 December 1943) was an English writer, illustrator, [[natural scientist]], and [[Conservation movement|conservationist]] best known for her children's books featuring animals, such as those in ''[[The Tale of Peter Rabbit]]''.

Born into an upper-class household, Potter was educated by [[governess]]es and grew up isolated from other children. She had numerous pets and spent holidays in Scotland and the [[Lake District]], developing a love of landscape, flora, and fauna, all of which she closely observed and painted.

Though Potter was typical of women of her generation in having limited opportunities for higher education, her study and watercolours of fungi led to her being widely respected in the field of [[mycology]]. In her thirties, Potter self-published the highly successful children's book ''[[The Tale of Peter Rabbit]]''. Following this, Potter began writing and illustrating children's books full-time.

In all, Potter wrote thirty books; the best known being her [[Beatrix Potter#Publications|twenty-three children's tales]]. With the proceeds from the books and a legacy from an aunt, in 1905 Potter bought [[Hill Top, Cumbria|Hill Top Farm]] in [[Near and Far Sawrey|Near Sawrey]], a village in the [[Lake District]] which at that time was in [[Lancashire]]. Over the following decades, she purchased additional farms to preserve the unique hill country landscape. In 1913, at the age of 47, she married William Heelis, a respected local solicitor from [[Hawkshead]]. Potter was also a prize-winning breeder of [[Herdwick sheep]] and a prosperous farmer keenly interested in land preservation. She continued to write and illustrate, and to design spin-off merchandise based on her children's books for British publisher Warne, until the duties of land management and her diminishing eyesight made it difficult to continue.

Potter died of [[pneumonia]] and [[heart disease]] on 22 December 1943 at her home in Near Sawrey at the age of 77, leaving almost all her property to the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]]. She is credited with preserving much of the land that now constitutes the [[Lake District National Park]]. Potter's books continue to sell throughout the world in many languages with her stories being retold in song, film, ballet, and animation, and her life depicted in a feature film and television film.

==Biography==

===Early life===
[[File:Young Beatrix.jpg|thumb|left|Potter at fifteen years with her [[English Springer Spaniel|springer spaniel]], Spot]]

Potter's paternal grandfather, [[Edmund Potter]], from [[Glossop]] in Derbyshire, owned what was then the largest [[calico]] printing works in England, and later served as a Member of Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Lear 2007, pp. 10–14&lt;/ref&gt;

Beatrix's father, Rupert William Potter (1832–1914), was educated at Manchester College by the [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] philosopher [[James Martineau|Dr. James Martineau]].&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Walker|first1=Tim|title=Mandrake-The Duchess of Cambridge is related to Beatrix Potter, who once gave the Middleton family her own original hand-painted illustrations|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/10980599/Kate-Middleton-is-related-to-Beatrix-Potter.html|newspaper=Daily Telegraph | location=UK | page=8 | date=22 July 2014|accessdate=16 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

He married Helen Leech (1839–1932) on 8 August 1863 at Hyde Unitarian Chapel, [[Gee Cross]]. Helen was the daughter of Jane Ashton (1806–1884) and John Leech, a wealthy cotton merchant and shipbuilder from [[Stalybridge]]. Helen's first cousins were [[Lupton family|Harriet Lupton]] (''née'' Ashton) and [[Thomas Ashton, 1st Baron Ashton of Hyde]]. It was reported in July 2014 that Beatrix had personally given a number of her own original hand-painted illustrations to the two daughters of Dr Arthur and Harriet Lupton, who were cousins to both Beatrix and  [[Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge]].&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Evening Mail |first1=NW |title=Cumbria author Beatrix Potter link to Prince George revealed |url=http://www.nwemail.co.uk/news/cumbria-author-beatrix-potter-link-to-prince-george-revealed-1.1149744 |date=21 July 2014 |newspaper=North-West Evening Mail |accessdate=16 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728105712/https://www.nwemail.co.uk/news/cumbria-author-beatrix-potter-link-to-prince-george-revealed-1.1149744 |archivedate=28 July 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beatrix's parents lived comfortably at 2 Bolton Gardens, [[West Brompton]], where Helen Beatrix was born on 28 July 1866 and her brother Walter Bertram on 14 March 1872.&lt;ref&gt;Lear 2007, pp. 13–24&lt;/ref&gt; Beatrix lived in the house until her marriage in 1913. The house was destroyed in [[the Blitz]]. Bousfield Primary School now stands where the house once was. A blue plaque on the school building testifies to the former site of The Potter home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beatrix Potter's London|url=https://londonist.com/2016/01/beatrix-potter-s-london|website=Londonist.com|accessdate=19 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both parents were artistically talented,&lt;ref&gt;Lear 2007, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; and Rupert was an adept amateur photographer.&lt;ref&gt;Lear 2007, pp. 35–36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rupert Potter was a member of the Photographic Society, later [[Royal Photographic Society]] from 1869 until 1912. Information from Michael Pritchard, Director-General / [http://www.rps.org www.rps.org], 13 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Rupert had invested in the stock market and by the early 1890s was extremely wealthy.&lt;ref&gt;Lear 2007, p. 19. Rupert came into his father's estate over the course of several years, 1884, 1891 and 1905. The Potters were comfortable but they did not live exclusively on inherited wealth; Lane, (1946) ''The Tale of Beatrix Potter'' 1946, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Potter's family on both sides were from the [[Manchester]] area.&lt;ref&gt;Lear 2007, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; They were English [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]],&lt;ref&gt;Lear 2007, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; associated with dissenting Protestant congregations, influential in 19th century England, that affirmed the oneness of God and that rejected the doctrine of the Trinity.

Beatrix was educated by three able governesses, the last of whom was Annie Moore (''née'' Carter), just three years older than Beatrix, who tutored Beatrix in German as well as acting as [[lady's companion]].&lt;ref&gt;Lear 2007, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; She and Beatrix remained friends throughout their lives and Annie's eight children were the recipients of many of Potter's delightful picture letters. It was Annie who later suggested that these letters might make good children's books.&lt;ref&gt;Lear 2007, p. 142; Lane, 1978.The Magic Years of Beatrix Potter. Lane depicts Potter's childhood as much more restricted than either or Potter's two later biographers. Taylor, ''Beatrix Potter: Artist Story Teller'', Ch 1.; Lear, 2007, pp. 25–48;  Beatrix Potter, ''The Journal of Beatrix Potter: From 1881–1897''.&lt;/ref&gt;

She and her younger brother Walter Bertram (1872–1918) grew up with few friends outside their large extended family. Her parents were artistic, interested in nature, and enjoyed the countryside. As children, Beatrix and Bertram had numerous small animals as pets which they observed closely and drew endlessly.  In their school room, Beatrix and Bertram kept a variety of small pets, mice, rabbits, a hedgehog and some bats, along with collections of butterflies and other insects which they drew and studied.&lt;ref&gt;Lear 2007, p. 31, pp. 37–44, p. 458nn15&lt;/ref&gt; Beatrix was devoted to the care of her small animals, often taking them with her on long holidays.&lt;ref&gt;Judy Taylor, Joyce Irene Whalley, Anne Stevenson Hobbs and Elizabeth Battrick, (1987) ''Beatrix Potter, 1866–1943: The Artist and Her World'', pp.9–17, 35–48; Lear, pp. 25–48.&lt;/ref&gt; In most of the first fifteen years of her life, Beatrix spent summer holidays at [[Dalguise]], an estate on the [[River Tay]] in Perthshire, Scotland. There she sketched and explored an area that nourished her imagination and her observation.&lt;ref&gt;Lear 2007, pp. 26–8, 51&lt;/ref&gt; Beatrix and her brother were allowed great freedom in the country and both children became adept students of [[natural history]]. In 1887, when Dalguise was no longer available, the Potters took their first summer holiday in the [[Lake District]], at [[Wray Castle]] near [[Windermere|Lake Windermere]].&lt;ref&gt;Lear 2007, pp. 51–2&lt;/ref&gt; Here Beatrix met [[Hardwicke Rawnsley]], vicar of Wray and later the founding secretary of the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]], whose interest in the countryside and country life inspired the same in Beatrix and who was to have a lasting impact on her life.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, ''The Journal, 1885–1897''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lear 2007, pp. 52–3&lt;/ref&gt;

At about the age of 14, Beatrix began to keep a diary. It was written in a code of her own devising which was a simple letter for letter [[Substitution cipher|substitution]]. Her ''Journal'' was important to the development of her creativity, serving as both sketchbook and literary experiment: in tiny handwriting she reported on society, recorded her impressions of art and artists, recounted stories and observed life around her.&lt;ref&gt;Lear 2007, pp.49–51 ''cf.'' also p. 463nn1&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Journal'', decoded and transcribed by Leslie Linder in 1958, does not provide an intimate record of her personal life, but it is an invaluable source for understanding a vibrant part of British society in the late 19th century. It describes Potter's maturing artistic and intellectual interests, her often amusing insights on the places she visited, and her unusual ability to observe nature and to describe it. Started in 1881, her journal ends in 1897 when her artistic and intellectual energies were absorbed in scientific study and in efforts to publish her drawings.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, "The Journal, 1885–1897"&lt;/ref&gt; Precocious but reserved and often bored, she was searching for more independent activities and wished to earn some money of her own whilst dutifully taking care of her parents, dealing with her especially demanding mother,&lt;ref&gt;Lear 2007, p. 94 also ''cf.'' p. 474nn55&lt;/ref&gt; and managing their various households.

===Scientific illustrations and work in mycology===
[[File:Beatrix Potter- Mycology. Source- Armitt Museum and Library.jpg|thumb|Beatrix Potter: reproductive system of [[Hygrocybe coccinea]], 1897.]]
Beatrix Potter's parents did not discourage higher education. As was common in the [[Victorian era]], women of her class were privately educated and rarely went to university.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, ''Artist, Storyteller'', pp. 59–61; Elizabeth E. Battrick, (1999) ''Beatrix Potter: The Unknown Years''; Lynn Barber, (1980) ''The Heyday of Natural History'', Brian Gardiner, "Breatrix Potter’s Fossils and Her Interests in Geology", The Linnean, 16/1 (January 2000), 31–47; Lear 2007, pp. 76–103; Potter, ''Journal, 1891–1897''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beatrix Potter was interested in every branch of natural science save [[astronomy]].&lt;ref&gt;Lear 2007, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; [[Botany]] was a passion for most [[Victorians]] and nature study was a popular enthusiasm. Potter was eclectic in her tastes: collecting fossils,&lt;ref&gt;Brian G. Gardiner, "Beatrix Potter's fossils and her interest in Geology," ''The Linnean: Newsletter and Proceedings of the Linnean Society of London'' 16/1 (January 2000), pp. 31–47&lt;/ref&gt; studying [[archeology|archeological]] artefacts from London excavations, and interested in [[entomology]]. In all these areas she drew and painted her specimens with increasing skill. By the 1890s her scientific interests centred on [[mycology]]. First drawn to fungi because of their colours and evanescence in nature and her delight in painting them, her interest deepened after meeting Charles McIntosh, a revered naturalist and amateur mycologist, during a summer holiday in Dunkeld in [[Perthshire]] in 1892. He helped improve the accuracy of her illustrations, taught her [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], and supplied her with live specimens to paint during the winter. Curious as to how fungi reproduced, Potter began microscopic drawings of fungus spores (the [[agaric]]s) and in 1895 developed a theory of their [[germination]].&lt;ref&gt;Lear 2007, pp. 81–103&lt;/ref&gt; Through the connections of her uncle [[Henry Enfield Roscoe|Sir Henry Enfield Roscoe]], a chemist and [[vice-chancellor (education)|vice-chancellor]] of the [[University of London]], she consulted with botanists at [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew|Kew Gardens]], convincing [[George Edward Massee|George Massee]] of her ability to germinate spores and her theory of [[F1 hybrid|hybridisation]].&lt;ref&gt;Lear 2007, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; She did not believe in the theory of [[symbiosis]] proposed by [[Simon Schwendener]], the German mycologist, as previously thought; rather she proposed a more independent process of reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;M.A. Taylor and R.H. Rodger, eds. (2003) ''A Fascinating Acquaintance: Charles McIntosh and Beatrix Potter''; Taylor, et al. (1987) ''Artist and Her World'', pp. 71–94; Lear 2007, pp. 104–129; Nicholas P. Money, "Beatrix Potter, Victorian Mycologist", ''Fungi''. 2:4 (Fall 2009); Roy Watling, "Helen Beatrix Potter: Her interest in fungi", ''The Linnean: Newsletter and Proceedings of the Linnean Society of London'', 16/1 (January 2000), pp. 24–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rebuffed by [[William Turner Thiselton-Dyer|William Thiselton-Dyer]], the Director at Kew, because of her gender and her amateur status, Beatrix wrote up her conclusions and submitted a paper, ''On the Germination of the Spores of the Agaricineae'', to the [[Linnean Society]] in 1897. It was introduced by Massee because, as a female, Potter could not attend proceedings or read her paper. She subsequently withdrew it, realising that some of her samples were contaminated, but continued her microscopic studies for several more years. Her paper has only recently been rediscovered, along with the rich, artistic illustrations and drawings that accompanied it. Her work is only now being properly evaluated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beatrix Potter and the Linnean Society|url=http://www.linnean.org/index.php?id=104|publisher=Linnean Society|accessdate=1 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lear 2007, pp. 104–25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linnean.org/Resources/LinneanSociety/Documents/Publications/The-Linnaen/Lin%20Vol%2016_%20no%201_%20Jan%202000.pdf |last=Watling |first=Roy |title=Helen Beatrix Potter: Her interest in fungi |work=The Linnean: Newsletter and Proceedings of the Linnean Society of London |volume=16 |issue=1 |date=January 2000 |pages=24–31 |authorlink=Roy Watling |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513210936/https://www.linnean.org/Resources/LinneanSociety/Documents/Publications/The-Linnaen/Lin%20Vol%2016_%20no%201_%20Jan%202000.pdf |archivedate=13 May 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Potter later gave her other mycological and scientific drawings to the [[Armitt Library|Armitt Museum and Library]] in Ambleside, where mycologists still refer to them to identify fungi. There is also a collection of her fungus paintings at the [[Perth Museum and Art Gallery]] in Perth, Scotland, donated by Charles McIntosh. In 1967, the mycologist [[Walter Philip Kennedy Findlay|W.P.K. Findlay]] included many of Potter's beautifully accurate fungus drawings in his ''Wayside &amp; Woodland Fungi'', thereby fulfilling her desire to one day have her fungus drawings published in a book.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Philip Kennedy Findlay, (1967) ''Wayside &amp; Woodland Fungi''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, the Linnean Society issued a posthumous apology to Potter for the sexism displayed in its handling of her research.&lt;ref&gt;Lear 2007, p. 125, p.482nn58&lt;/ref&gt;

===Artistic and literary career===
[[File:Peter Rabbit first edition 1902a.jpg|thumb|upright|First edition, 1902]]
Potter's artistic and literary interests were deeply influenced by fairies, fairy tales and fantasy. She was a student of the classic fairy tales of Western Europe. As well as stories from the [[Old Testament]], [[John Bunyan]]'s ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]'' and [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'', she grew up with ''[[Aesop's Fables]]'', the fairy tales of the [[Brothers Grimm]] and [[Hans Christian Andersen]], [[Charles Kingsley]]'s ''[[The Water-Babies, A Fairy Tale for a Land Baby|The Water Babies]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Lear 2007, pp. 30–1&lt;/ref&gt; the folk tales and [[Scottish mythology|mythology of Scotland]], the [[German Romanticism|German Romantics]], [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]],&lt;ref&gt;Lear 2007, p. 95. She liked to memorise his plays by heart.&lt;/ref&gt; and the romances of [[Sir Walter Scott]].&lt;ref&gt;Lear 2007, p. 35. Beatrix said she learnt to read "on" Scott&lt;/ref&gt; As a young child, before the age of eight, [[Edward Lear]]'s ''Book of Nonsense'', including the much loved ''[[The Owl and the Pussycat]]'', and [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland|Alice in Wonderland]]'' had made their impression, although she later said of ''Alice'' that she was more interested in [[John Tenniel|Tenniel]]'s illustrations than what they were about.&lt;ref&gt;Lear 2007, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Brer Rabbit]]'' stories of [[Joel Chandler Harris]] had been family favourites, and she later studied his ''[[Uncle Remus]]'' stories and illustrated them.&lt;ref&gt;Lear 2007, p.131. She began eight ''Uncle Remus'' drawings in the same year 1893 she began writing the ''Peter Rabbit'' picture letters to Noel Moore, completing the last in 1896.&lt;/ref&gt; She studied book illustration from a young age and developed her own tastes, but the work of the picture book triumvirate [[Walter Crane]], [[Kate Greenaway]] and [[Randolph Caldecott]], the last an illustrator whose work was later collected by her father, was a great influence.&lt;ref&gt;Lear 2007, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; When she started to illustrate, she chose first the traditional rhymes and stories, "[[Cinderella]]", "[[Sleeping Beauty]]", "[[Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves]]", "[[Puss in Boots|Puss-in-boots]]", and "[[Red Riding Hood]]".&lt;ref&gt;Lear 2007, pp. 127–8&lt;/ref&gt; But most often her illustrations were fantasies featuring her own pets: mice, rabbits, kittens, and guinea pigs.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, et al., ''The Artist and her World,'' pp. 49–70;  Potter, ''Journal, 1884–1897''; Humphrey Carpenter (1985), ''Secret Gardens: The Golden Age of Children’s Literature.''&lt;/ref&gt;

In her teenage years, Potter was a regular visitor to the art galleries of London, particularly enjoying the summer and winter exhibitions at the [[Royal Academy]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;Lear 2007, p. 47-8. [[J. M. W. Turner]] was the first artist to impress her.&lt;/ref&gt; Her ''Journal'' reveals her growing sophistication as a critic as well as the influence of her father's friend, the artist [[Sir John Everett Millais]], who recognised Beatrix's talent of observation. Although Potter was aware of art and artistic trends, her drawing and her prose style were uniquely her own.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, ''Artist, Storyteller,'' pp. 70–95; Taylor, ed. 1989, ''Beatrix Potters Letters''.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a way to earn money in the 1890s, Beatrix and her brother began to print Christmas cards of their own design, as well as cards for special occasions. Mice and rabbits were the most frequent subject of her fantasy paintings. In 1890, the firm of Hildesheimer and Faulkner bought several of her drawings of her rabbit [[Benjamin Bunny]] to illustrate verses by [[Frederic Weatherly]] titled ''A Happy Pair''. In 1893, the same printer bought several more drawings for Weatherly's ''Our Dear Relations'', another book of rhymes, and the following year Potter sold a series of frog illustrations and verses for ''Changing Pictures'', a popular annual offered by the art publisher Ernest Nister. Potter was pleased by this success and determined to publish her own illustrated stories.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, et al. 1987, pp. 107–148; Katherine Chandler, "Thoroughly Post-Victorian, Pre-Modern Beatrix." ''Children's Literature Quarterly''. 32(4): 287–307.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whenever Potter went on holiday to the [[Lake District]] or [[Scotland]], she sent letters to young friends, illustrating them with quick sketches. Many of these letters were written to the children of her former governess Annie Carter Moore, particularly to Moore's eldest son Noel who was often ill. In September 1893, Potter was on holiday at Eastwood in [[Dunkeld]], Perthshire. She had run out of things to say to Noel and so she told him a story about "four little rabbits whose names were Flopsy, Mopsy, Cottontail and Peter". It became one of the most famous children's letters ever written and the basis of Potter's future career as a writer-artist-storyteller.&lt;ref&gt;Judy Taylor 1992, ''Letters to Children from Beatrix Potter''.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Beatrix Potter dummy manuscripts.jpg|thumb|left|Potter's dummy manuscripts of three of her books - designed to see how the printed book would look]]
In 1900, Potter revised her tale about the four little rabbits, and fashioned a dummy book of it – it has been suggested, in imitation of [[Helen Bannerman]]'s 1899 bestseller ''[[The Story of Little Black Sambo]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, Laura C. "A Vogue for Small Books": The Tale of Peter Rabbit and its Contemporary Competitors" [http://www.lauracstevenson.org/avogueoflittlebooks.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Unable to find a buyer for the work, she published it for family and friends at her own expense in December 1901. It was drawn in black and white with a coloured frontispiece. Family friend [[canon (priest)|Canon]] [[Hardwicke Rawnsley]] had great faith in Potter's tale, recast it in didactic verse, and made the rounds of the London publishing houses. [[Frederick Warne &amp; Co]] had previously rejected the tale but, eager to compete in the booming small format children's book market, reconsidered and accepted the "bunny book" (as the firm called it) following the recommendation of their prominent children's book artist [[L. Leslie Brooke]].&lt;ref&gt;Lear 2007, pp. 144–7&lt;/ref&gt; The firm declined Rawnsley's verse in favour of Potter's original prose, and Potter agreed to colour her pen and ink illustrations, choosing the then new [[Edmund Evans#Later work and retirement|Hentschel three-colour process]] to reproduce her watercolours.&lt;ref name="Hobbs15"&gt;Hobbs 1989, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Tower Bank Arms.jpg|thumb|right|Potter used many real locations for her book illustrations. The Tower Bank Arms, Near Sawrey appears in ''The Tale of Jemima Puddle-Duck''.]]
On 2 October 1902, ''[[The Tale of Peter Rabbit]]'' was published,&lt;ref&gt;Taylor 1996, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; and was an immediate success. It was followed the next year by ''[[The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin]]'' and ''[[The Tailor of Gloucester]]'', which had also first been written as picture letters to the Moore children. Working with [[Norman Warne]] as her editor, Potter published two or three little books each year: 23 books in all. The last book in this format was ''[[Cecily Parsley's Nursery Rhymes]]'' in 1922, a collection of favourite rhymes. Although ''[[The Tale of Little Pig Robinson]]'' was not published until 1930, it had been written much earlier. Potter continued creating her little books until after the [[First World War]], when her energies were increasingly directed toward her farming, sheep-breeding and land conservation.&lt;ref&gt;Judy Taylor 2002, ''That Naughty Rabbit: Beatrix Potter and Peter Rabbit'';  Lear 2007, pp. 207–247; Anne Stevenson Hobbs, ed. 1989, ''Beatrix Potter’s Art: Paintings and Drawings''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The immense popularity of Potter's books was based on the lively quality of her illustrations, the non-didactic nature of her stories, the depiction of the rural countryside, and the imaginative qualities she lent to her animal characters.

Potter was also a canny businesswoman. As early as 1903, she made and patented a [[Peter Rabbit]] doll. It was followed by other "spin-off" merchandise over the years, including painting books, board games, wall-paper, figurines, baby blankets and china tea-sets. All were licensed by [[Frederick Warne &amp; Co]] and earned Potter an independent income, as well as immense profits for her publisher.&lt;ref&gt;See Judy Taylor 2002, "That Naughty Rabbit"&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, Potter and [[Norman Warne]] became unofficially engaged. Potter's parents objected to the match because Warne was "in trade" and thus not socially suitable. The engagement lasted only one month until Warne died of [[pernicious anaemia]] at age 37.&lt;ref&gt;Lear 2007, pp.198- 201&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, Potter used some of her income and a small inheritance from an aunt to buy [[Hill Top Farm]] in [[Near Sawrey]] in the English [[Lake District]] near Windermere. Potter and Warne may have hoped that Hill Top Farm would be their holiday home, but after Warne's death, Potter went ahead with its purchase as she had always wanted to own that farm, and live in "that charming village".&lt;ref&gt;Lear 2007, p. 207&lt;/ref&gt;

===Country life===
[[File:Hill Top Farm.jpg|thumb|right|Hill Top, Near Sawrey&amp;nbsp;– Potter's former home, now owned by the National Trust and preserved as it was when she lived and wrote her stories there.]]
The tenant farmer John Cannon and his family agreed to stay on to manage the farm for her while she made physical improvements and learned the techniques of [[fell farming]] and of raising livestock, including pigs, cows and chickens; the following year she added sheep. Realising she needed to protect her boundaries, she sought advice from W.H. Heelis &amp; Son, a local firm of solicitors with offices in nearby [[Hawkshead]]. With William Heelis acting for her she bought contiguous pasture, and in 1909 the {{convert|20|acre|ha}} Castle Farm across the road from Hill Top Farm. She visited Hill Top at every opportunity, and her books written during this period (such as ''[[The Tale of Ginger and Pickles]]'', about the local shop in Near Sawrey and ''[[The Tale of Mrs. Tittlemouse]]'', a wood mouse) reflect her increasing participation in village life and her delight in country living.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, ed., (2002) ''Beatrix Potter's Letters''; Hunter Davies, ''Beatrix Potter's Lakeland''; W.R. Mitchell, ''Potter: Her Life in the Lake District''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Owning and managing these working farms required routine collaboration with the widely respected William Heelis. By the summer of 1912 Heelis had proposed marriage and Beatrix had accepted; although she did not immediately tell her parents, who once again disapproved because Heelis was only a country solicitor. Potter and Heelis were married on 15 October 1913 in London at [[St Mary Abbots]] in [[Kensington]]. The couple moved immediately to [[Near and Far Sawrey|Near Sawrey]], residing at Castle Cottage, the renovated farm house on Castle Farm, which was 34 acres large. Hill Top remained a working farm but was now remodelled to allow for the tenant family and Potter's private studio and workshop. At last her own woman, Potter settled into the partnerships that shaped the rest of her life: her country solicitor husband and his large family, her farms, the Sawrey community and the predictable rounds of country life. ''[[The Tale of Jemima Puddle-Duck]]'' and ''[[The Tale of Tom Kitten]]'' are representative of Hill Top Farm and of her farming life, and reflect her happiness with her country life.&lt;ref&gt;John Heelis, (1999) ''The Tale of Mrs William Heelis&amp;nbsp;– Beatrix Potter''; Lear, Ch. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rupert Potter died in 1914 and, with the outbreak of [[World War I]], Potter, now a wealthy woman, persuaded her mother to move to the Lake District and found a property for her to rent in Sawrey. Finding life in Sawrey dull, Helen Potter soon moved to Lindeth Howe (now a 34 bedroomed hotel) a large house the Potters had previously rented for the summer in [[Bowness-on-Windermere|Bowness]], on the other side of Lake Windermere,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= McDowell|first= Marta|title=Beatrix Potter's Gardening Life: The Plants and Places That Inspired the classic children's tales|publisher=Timber Press|date=2013|pages=116|isbn=1604693630}}&lt;/ref&gt; Potter continued to write stories for Frederick Warne &amp; Co and fully participated in country life. She established a Nursing Trust for local villages, and served on various committees and councils responsible for footpaths and other rural issues.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor et al. ''The Artist and Her World'', pp. 185–194; Taylor, ''Artist Storyteller'', pp. 105–144.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sheep farming===
Soon after acquiring Hill Top Farm, Potter became keenly interested in the breeding and raising of [[Herdwick|Herdwick sheep]], the indigenous fell sheep. In 1923 she bought a large sheep farm in the Troutbeck Valley called [[Troutbeck Park|Troutbeck Park Farm]], formerly a deer park, restoring its land with thousands of Herdwick sheep. This established her as one of the major Herdwick sheep farmers in the county. She was admired by her shepherds and farm managers for her willingness to experiment with the latest biological remedies for the common diseases of sheep, and for her employment of the best shepherds, sheep breeders, and farm managers.&lt;ref&gt;William Rollinson, (1981) ''How They Lived in the Lake District''; Susan Denyer, 1993 ''Herdwick Sheep Farming''; Geoff Brown, (2009) ''Herdwicks: Herdwick Sheep and the English Lake District''; Judy Taylor, ed., (1998) ''Beatrix Potter’s Farming Friendship. Lake District Letters to Joseph Moscrop, 1926–1943''.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1920s Potter and her Hill Top farm manager Tom Storey had made a name for their prize-winning Herdwick flock, which took many prizes at the local agricultural shows, where Potter was often asked to serve as a judge. In 1942 she became President-elect of the Herdwick Sheepbreeders’ Association, the first time a woman had ever been elected, but died before taking office.&lt;ref&gt;Lear 2007, pp. 381–404&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lake District conservation==
Potter had been a disciple of the land conservation and preservation ideals of her long-time friend and mentor, [[Hardwicke Rawnsley|Canon Hardwicke Rawnsley]], the first secretary and founding member of the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty]]. She supported the efforts of the National Trust to preserve not just the places of extraordinary beauty but also those heads of valleys and low grazing lands that would be irreparably ruined by development. She was also an authority on the traditional Lakeland crafts, period furniture and stonework. She restored and preserved the farms that she bought or managed, making sure that each farm house had in it a piece of antique Lakeland furniture. Potter was interested in preserving not only the [[Herdwick sheep]], but also the way of life of fell farming. In 1930 the Heelises became partners with the National Trust in buying and managing the fell farms included in the large Monk Coniston Estate. The estate was composed of many farms spread over a wide area of north-western Lancashire, including the [[Tarn Hows]]. Potter was the ''de facto'' estate manager for the Trust for seven years until the National Trust could afford to buy most of the property back from her. Her stewardship of these farms earned her wide regard, but she was not without her critics, not the least of which were her contemporaries who felt she used her wealth and the position of her husband to acquire properties in advance of their being made public. She was notable in observing the problems of [[afforestation]], preserving the intake grazing lands, and husbanding the quarries and timber on these farms. All her farms were stocked with Herdwick sheep and frequently with [[Galloway cattle]].

==Later life==
Potter continued to write stories and to draw, although mostly for her own pleasure. Her books in the late 1920s included the semi-autobiographical ''[[The Fairy Caravan]]'', a fanciful tale set in her beloved [[Troutbeck Tongue|Troutbeck fells]]. It was published only in the US during Potter's lifetime, and not until 1952 in the UK. ''Sister Anne'', Potter's version of the story of [[Bluebeard]], was written especially for her American readers, but illustrated by Katharine Sturges. A final folktale, ''Wag by Wall'', was published posthumously by ''[[The Horn Book Magazine]]'' in 1944. Potter was a generous patron of the [[Girl Guides]], whose troupes she allowed to make their summer encampments on her land, and whose company she enjoyed as an older woman.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Morse, ed., (1982) ''Beatrix Potter's Americans: Selected Letters''; Susan Denyer, (2000) ''At Home with Beatrix Potter: The Creator of Peter Rabbit''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Potter and William Heelis enjoyed a happy marriage of thirty years, continuing their farming and preservation efforts throughout the hard days of [[World War II]]. Although they were childless, Potter played an important role in William's large family, particularly enjoying her relationship with several nieces whom she helped educate, and giving comfort and aid to her husband's brothers and sisters.&lt;ref&gt;Heelis, ''Mrs. William Heelis''; Taylor, ed., ''Beatrix Potter's Letters''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Potter died of complications from [[pneumonia]] and [[heart disease]] on 22 December 1943 at Castle Cottage, and her remains were cremated at [[Carleton Crematorium and Cemetery|Carleton Crematorium]]. She left nearly all her property to the National Trust, including over {{convert|4000|acre|km2}} of land, sixteen farms, cottages and herds of cattle and Herdwick sheep. Hers was the largest gift at that time to the National Trust, and it enabled the preservation of the land now included in the [[Lake District National Park]] and the continuation of fell farming. The central office of the National Trust in [[Swindon]] was named "Heelis" in 2005 in her memory. William Heelis continued his stewardship of their properties and of her literary and artistic work for the eighteen months he survived her. When he died in August 1945 he left the remainder to the National Trust.&lt;ref&gt;Lear 2007, pp. 405–440; Taylor, ed., ''Beatrix Potter's Letters''; Taylor, et al., ''The Artist and Her World''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Goody and Mrs. Hackee.jpg|thumb|left|Goody and Mrs. Hackee, illustration to ''The Tale of Timmy Tiptoes'', 1911]]
Potter left almost all the original illustrations for her books to the National Trust. The copyright to her stories and merchandise was then given to her publisher Frederick Warne &amp; Co, now a division of the [[Penguin Group]].  On 1 January 2014, the copyright expired in the UK and other countries with a 70-years-after-death limit. Hill Top Farm was opened to the public by the National Trust in 1946; her artwork was displayed there until 1985 when it was moved to William Heelis's former law offices in [[Hawkshead]], also owned by the National Trust as the [[Beatrix Potter Gallery]].&lt;ref&gt;Bruce L. Thompson, 'Beatrix Potter's Gift to the Public'. ''Country Life'' (3 March 1944), 370–371; Taylor, et al., ''The Artist Storyteller'', Ch. 6; Lear 2007, pp. 441–447.&lt;/ref&gt;

Potter gave her folios of mycological drawings to the [[Armitt Library|Armitt Library and Museum]] in [[Ambleside]] before her death. ''The Tale of Peter Rabbit'' is owned by Frederick Warne and Company, ''The Tailor of Gloucester'' by the [[Tate Gallery]] and ''The Tale of the Flopsy Bunnies'' by the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://culturalinstitute.britishmuseum.org/asset-viewer/beatrix-potter-flopsy-bunnies-a-drawing-in-pen-and-ink-with-watercolour/DQEnktGEHYojdQ?hl=en|title=British Museum - Google Arts &amp; Culture|website=britishmuseum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest public collection of her letters and drawings is the Leslie Linder Bequest and Leslie Linder Collection at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London. In the United States, the largest public collections are those in the Rare Book Department&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beatrix Potter Collection at the Free Library of Philadelphia|url=https://libwww.freelibrary.org/ead/view.cfm?name=Potter}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Free Library of Philadelphia]], and the [[Cotsen Children's Library]] at [[Princeton University]].

In 2015 a manuscript for an unpublished book was discovered by Jo Hanks, a publisher at Penguin Random House Children's Books, in the Victoria and Albert Museum archive. The book ''[[The Tale of Kitty-in-Boots]]'', with illustrations by [[Quentin Blake]],&lt;ref name="kitty in boots"&gt;{{cite news|title=Beatrix Potter story Kitty-in-Boots discovered after 100 years|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-35407846|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=26 January 2016|accessdate=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was published 1 September 2016, to mark the 150th anniversary of Potter's birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/26/entertainment/new-beatrix-potter-kitty-in-boots/index.html|date=26 January 2016|title=Long-lost Beatrix Potter tale, 'Kitty-in-Boots,' rediscovered|author=Jones, Bryony|work= CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, ''The Art of Beatrix Potter: Sketches, Paintings, and Illustrations'' by Emily Zach was published after San Francisco publisher [[Chronicle Books]] decided to mark the 150th anniversary of Beatrix Potter's birth by showing that she was "far more than a 19th-century weekend painter. She was an artist of astonishing range."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.richmond.com/ap/entertainment/article_e2139de6-873f-514d-a2f0-b6029ee885c6.html{{dead link|date=April 2018}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, the asteroid [[13975 Beatrixpotter]], discovered by Belgian astronomer [[Eric Elst]] in 1992, was named in her memory.

==Analysis==
There are many interpretations of Potter's literary work, the sources of her art, and her life and times. These include critical evaluations of her corpus of children's literature, and [[Modernism|Modernist]] interpretations of [[Humphrey Carpenter]] and Katherine Chandler. Judy Taylor, ''That Naughty Rabbit: Beatrix Potter and Peter Rabbit'' (rev. 2002) tells the story of the first publication and many editions.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, et al., (2009) ''The Artist and Her World''. Considers Potter's career and life in chapters arranged thematically; ''The Pitkin Guide to Beatrix Potter''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Potter’s country life and her farming has also been widely discussed in the work of Susan Denyer and by other authors in the publications of [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|The National Trust]].

Potter's work as a scientific illustrator and her work in mycology is highlighted in several chapters in Linda Lear, ''Beatrix Potter: A Life in Nature'', 2007; ''Beatrix Potter: The Extraordinary Life of a Victorian Genius''. 2008.

==Adaptations==

In 1971, a ballet film was released, ''[[The Tales of Beatrix Potter]]'', directed by Reginald Mills, set to music by [[John Lanchbery]] with choreography by [[Frederick Ashton]], and performed in character costume by members of the [[Birmingham Royal Ballet|Royal Ballet]] and the [[Royal Opera House]] orchestra.  The ballet of the same name has been performed by other dance companies around the world.

In 1992, Potter's famous children's book ''[[The Tale of Benjamin Bunny]]'' was featured in the film ''[[Lorenzo's Oil]]''.

Potter is also featured in [[Susan Wittig Albert]]'s series of light mysteries called The Cottage Tales of Beatrix Potter. The first of the eight-book series is ''Tale of Hill Top Farm'' (2004), which deals with Potter's life in the [[Lake District]] and the village of [[Near Sawrey]] between 1905 and 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cottage Tales|url=http://www.cottagetales.com/books/index.shtml|publisher=Susan Wittig Albert|accessdate=13 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, John Patrick is adapting a number of Beatrix Potter's tales into an upcoming live-action/animated musical feature film for his brand-new film studio, called Storybook Studio. The film will be titled '''''Beatrix Potter's The Tales of Peter Rabbit and Friends''''' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt9261226/|title=Beatrix Potter's The Tales Of Peter Rabbit And Friends|publisher=|accessdate=29 November 2018|via=www.imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;. English actress Jackie Weiner will play Beatrix Potter herself, with the voices of Sienna Adams as Peter Rabbit, Ronan McCoid as Benjamin Bunny, Ella Bradley as Tom Kitten, Kyle Tanis as Mr. Jeremy Fisher, Leslie Fanelli as Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle and Karen Zikas as Jemima Puddle-Duck. John Patrick has released several clips of his upcoming film to YouTube. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG-I6lp7SpQ&amp;t=145s|title="Beatrix Potter's The Tales Of Peter Rabbit And Friends" - The Tale Of Peter Rabbit|first=|last=Storybook Studio|date=27 October 2018|publisher=|accessdate=29 November 2018|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4dXLzYw7zY&amp;t=8s|title="Beatrix Potter's The Tales Of Peter Rabbit And Friends" - The Tale Of Benjamin Bunny|first=|last=Storybook Studio|date=27 October 2018|publisher=|accessdate=29 November 2018|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUZMIaSWeiU&amp;t=2s|title="Beatrix Potter's The Tales Of Peter Rabbit And Friends" - The Tale Of Tom Kitten|first=|last=Storybook Studio|date=27 October 2018|publisher=|accessdate=29 November 2018|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt9261226/|title=Beatrix Potter's The Tales Of Peter Rabbit And Friends|publisher=|accessdate=29 November 2018|via=www.imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In film==

In 1982, the [[BBC]] produced ''The Tale of Beatrix Potter''. This dramatisation of her life was written by [[John Hawkesworth (producer)|John Hawkesworth]], directed by Bill Hayes, and starred [[Holly Aird]] and [[Penelope Wilton]] as the young and adult Beatrix, respectively.  ''[[The World of Peter Rabbit and Friends]]'', a TV series based on her stories, which starred actress [[Niamh Cusack]] as Beatrix Potter, has been released on [[VHS]] by [[Pickwick Video]] and later [[Carlton Video]].

In 2006, [[Chris Noonan]] directed ''[[Miss Potter]]'', a biographical film of Potter's life focusing on her early career and romance with her editor [[Norman Warne]]. The film stars [[Renée Zellweger]], [[Ewan McGregor]] and [[Emily Watson]].

On February 9, 2018, Columbia Pictures released ''[[Peter Rabbit (film)|Peter Rabbit]]'', directed by Will Gluck, based on the work by Potter.

'''Bersame Glacier''' ({{lang-bg|text=ледник Берсаме|italic=no}}, ‘Lednik Bersame’ \'led-nik 'ber-sa-me\) is the 2.4 km long and 1.5 km wide glacier on the west side of [[Urda Ridge]] on [[Clarence Island (South Shetland Islands)|Clarence Island]] in the [[South Shetland Islands]], [[Antarctica]] situated northeast of [[Giridava Glacier]].  It drains the slopes of [[Mount Llana]], flows northwestwards and enters the [[Southern Ocean]] northeast of the [[Glacier terminus|terminus]] of [[Giridava Glacier]].

The glacier is named after the [[Thracians|Thracian]] settlement of Bersame in Southeastern Bulgaria.

Within the organisms, genes are transcribed and spliced to produce mature mRNA transcripts (red). The mRNA is extracted from the organism and reverse transcriptase is used to copy the mRNA into stable ds-cDNA (blue). In microarrays, the ds-cDNA is fragmented and fluorescently labelled (orange). The labelled fragments bind to an ordered array of complementary oligonucleotides, and [[Fluorometer|measurement of fluorescent intensity]] across the array indicates the abundance of a predetermined set of sequences.

A '''DNA microarray''' (also commonly known as [[DNA]] chip or [[biochip]]) is a collection of microscopic DNA spots attached to a solid surface. Scientists use DNA [[microarray]]s to measure the [[Gene expression|expression]] levels of large numbers of genes simultaneously or to [[genotyping|genotype]] multiple regions of a genome. Each DNA spot contains [[Pico-|picomoles]] (10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; [[Mole (unit)|moles]]) of a specific DNA sequence, known as ''[[Hybridization probe|probe]]s'' (or ''reporters'' or ''[[oligonucleotide|oligo]]s''). These can be a short section of a [[gene]] or other DNA element that are used to [[Nucleic acid hybridization#Hybridization|hybridize]] a [[cDNA]] or cRNA (also called anti-sense RNA) &lt;!--Agilent kit--&gt; sample (called ''target'') under high-stringency conditions. Probe-target hybridization is usually detected and quantified by detection of [[fluorophore]]-, silver-, or [[chemiluminescence]]-labeled targets to determine relative abundance of nucleic acid sequences in the target. The original nucleic acid arrays were macro arrays approximately 9&amp;nbsp;cm × 12&amp;nbsp;cm and the first computerized image based analysis was published in 1981.&lt;ref name="Taub"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taub|first1=Floyd|title=Laboratory methods: Sequential comparative hybridizations analyzed by computerized image processing can identify and quantitate regulated RNAs|journal=DNA|date=1983|volume=2|issue=4|pages=309–327|doi=10.1089/dna.1983.2.309|pmid=6198132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Nucleic acid hybridization}}
{{Details|#A typical protocol}}
&lt;!-- KEEP SECTION SIMPLE --&gt;
The core principle behind microarrays is hybridization between two DNA strands, the property of [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] nucleic acid sequences to specifically pair with each other by forming [[hydrogen bond]]s between complementary [[Nucleotide|nucleotide base pairs]]. A high number of complementary base pairs in a nucleotide sequence means tighter [[non-covalent]] bonding between the two strands. After washing off non-specific bonding sequences, only strongly paired strands will remain hybridized. Fluorescently labeled target sequences that bind to a probe sequence generate a signal that depends on the hybridization conditions (such as temperature), and washing after hybridization. Total strength of the signal, from a spot (feature), depends upon the amount of target sample binding to the probes present on that spot. Microarrays use relative quantitation in which the intensity of a feature is compared to the intensity of the same feature under a different condition, &lt;!-- 2 channel experiments are mentioned below! so do not repeat --&gt; and the identity of the feature is known by its position.

== Uses and types ==
[[Image:Affymetrix-microarray.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Two Affymetrix chips. A [[match]] is shown at bottom left for size comparison.]]
Many types of arrays exist and the broadest distinction is whether they are spatially arranged on a surface or on coded beads:
* The traditional solid-phase array is a collection of orderly microscopic "spots", called features, each with thousands of identical and specific probes attached to a solid surface, such as [[glass]], [[plastic]] or [[silicon]] [[biochip]] (commonly known as a ''genome chip'', ''DNA chip'' or ''gene array''). Thousands of these features can be placed in known locations on a single DNA microarray.
* The alternative bead array is a collection of microscopic polystyrene beads, each with a specific probe and a ratio of two or more dyes, which do not interfere with the fluorescent dyes used on the target sequence.

DNA microarrays can be used to detect DNA (as in [[comparative genomic hybridization]]), or detect RNA (most commonly as [[cDNA]] after [[reverse transcription]]) that may or may not be translated into proteins. The process of measuring gene expression via cDNA is called [[gene expression|expression analysis]] or [[expression profiling]].

Applications include:

|-
| [[Gene expression profiling]]
| In an [[mRNA]] or [[gene expression profiling]] experiment the [[Gene expression|expression]] levels of thousands of genes are simultaneously monitored to study the effects of certain treatments, [[disease]]s, and developmental stages on gene expression. For example, microarray-based gene expression profiling can be used to identify genes whose expression is changed in response to [[pathogens]] or other organisms by comparing gene expression in infected to that in uninfected cells or tissues.&lt;ref name="Adomas et al."&gt;{{cite journal|author=Adomas A|author2=Heller G|author3=Olson A|author4=Osborne J|author5=Karlsson M|author6=Nahalkova J|author7=Van Zyl L|author8=Sederoff R|author9=Stenlid J|author10=Finlay R|author11=Asiegbu FO|date=2008|title=Comparative analysis of transcript abundance in Pinus sylvestris after challenge with a saprotrophic, pathogenic or mutualistic fungus|journal=Tree Physiol.|volume=28|pages=885–897|pmid=18381269|issue=6|doi=10.1093/treephys/28.6.885}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
| GeneID
| Small microarrays to check IDs of organisms in food and feed (like [[GMO]] [http://bgmo.jrc.ec.europa.eu/home/docs.htm]), [[mycoplasms]] in cell culture, or [[pathogens]] for disease detection, mostly combining [[PCR]] and microarray technology.
|-
| [[ChIP-on-chip|Chromatin immunoprecipitation on Chip]]
| DNA sequences bound to a particular protein can be isolated by [[immunoprecipitation|immunoprecipitating]] that protein ([[Chromatin immunoprecipitation|ChIP]]), these fragments can be then hybridized to a microarray (such as a [[tiling array]]) allowing the determination of protein binding site occupancy throughout the genome. Example protein to [[Chromatin immunoprecipitation|immunoprecipitate]] are histone modifications (H3K27me3, H3K4me2, H3K9me3, etc.), [[Polycomb-group protein]] (PRC2:Suz12, PRC1:YY1) and [[trithorax-group protein]] (Ash1) to study the [[epigenetics|epigenetic landscape]] or [[RNA Polymerase II]] to study the [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription landscape]].
|-
| [[DamID]]
| Analogously to [[ChIP]], genomic regions bound by a protein of interest can be isolated and used to probe a microarray to determine binding site occupancy. Unlike ChIP, DamID does not require antibodies but makes use of adenine methylation near the protein's binding sites to selectively amplify those regions, introduced by expressing minute amounts of protein of interest fused to bacterial [[Dam (methylase)|DNA adenine methyltransferase]].

|-
| [[Alternative splicing]] detection
| An ''[[exon junction array]]'' design uses probes specific to the expected or potential splice sites of predicted [[exon]]s for a gene. It is of intermediate density, or coverage, to a typical gene expression array (with 1–3 probes per gene) and a genomic tiling array (with hundreds or thousands of probes per gene). It is used to assay the expression of alternative splice forms of a gene. [[Exon array]]s have a different design, employing probes designed to detect each individual exon for known or predicted genes, and can be used for detecting different splicing isoforms.
|-
| [[Fusion gene]]s microarray
| A Fusion gene microarray can detect fusion transcripts, ''e.g.'' from cancer specimens. The principle behind this is building on the [[alternative splicing]] microarrays. The oligo design strategy enables combined measurements of chimeric transcript junctions with exon-wise measurements of individual fusion partners.
|-
| [[Tiling array]]
| Genome tiling arrays consist of overlapping probes designed to densely represent a genomic region of interest, sometimes as large as an entire human chromosome. The purpose is to empirically detect expression of [[mRNA|transcripts]] or [[Alternative splicing|alternatively spliced forms]] which may not have been previously known or predicted.

=== Fabrication ===
Microarrays can be manufactured in different ways, depending on the number of probes under examination, costs, customization requirements, and the type of scientific question being asked. Arrays from commercial vendors may have as few as 10 probes or as many as 5 million or more micrometre-scale probes.
&lt;!-- Repetition of second paragraph but less detail
=== Surface engineering ===

The first step of DNA microarray fabrication involves [[surface engineering]] of a substrate in order to obtain desirable surface properties for the application of interest. Optimal surface properties are those which produce high signal to noise ratios for the DNA targets of interest. Generally, this involves maximizing the probe surface density and activity while minimizing the non-specific binding of the targets of interest.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Methods of surface engineering vary depending on the platform material, design, and application.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} However micro-array system can be  modified.

=== Spotted vs. ''in situ'' synthesised arrays ===
[[Image:Microarray printing.ogv|thumb|300px|A DNA microarray being printed by a [[robot]] at the [[University of Delaware]] ]]

Microarrays can be fabricated using a variety of technologies, including printing with fine-pointed pins onto glass slides, [[photolithography]] using pre-made masks, photolithography using dynamic micromirror devices, ink-jet printing,&lt;ref&gt;J Biochem Biophys Methods. 2000 Mar 16;42(3):105-10. DNA-printing: utilization of a standard inkjet printer for the transfer of nucleic acids to solid supports. Goldmann T, Gonzalez JS.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://genomebiology.com/2004/5/8/R58 |journal=Genome Biology | title=POSaM: a fast, flexible, open-source, inkjet oligonucleotide synthesizer and microarrayer| author=Lausted C| volume = 5 | pages=R58 | doi=10.1186/gb-2004-5-8-r58 | pmid=15287980 | date=2004| issue=8| pmc=507883|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[electrochemistry]] on microelectrode arrays.

In ''spotted microarrays'', the probes are [[oligonucleotide synthesis|oligonucleotide]]s, [[cDNA]] or small fragments of [[PCR]] products that correspond to [[mRNA]]s. The probes are [[oligonucleotide synthesis|synthesized]] prior to deposition on the array surface and are then "spotted" onto glass. A common approach utilizes an array of fine pins or needles controlled by a robotic arm that is dipped into wells containing DNA probes and then depositing each probe at designated locations on the array surface. The resulting "grid" of probes represents the nucleic acid profiles of the prepared probes and is ready to receive complementary cDNA or cRNA "targets" derived from experimental or clinical samples.
This technique is used by research scientists around the world to produce "in-house" printed microarrays from their own labs. These arrays may be easily customized for each experiment, because researchers can choose the probes and printing locations on the arrays, synthesize the probes in their own lab (or collaborating facility), and spot the arrays. They can then generate their own labeled samples for hybridization, hybridize the samples to the array, and finally scan the arrays with their own equipment. This provides a relatively low-cost microarray that may be customized for each study, and avoids the costs of purchasing often more expensive commercial arrays that may represent vast numbers of genes that are not of interest to the investigator.
Publications exist which indicate in-house spotted microarrays may not provide the same level of sensitivity compared to commercial oligonucleotide arrays,&lt;ref name="TRC Standardization"&gt;{{cite journal |date=2005 |title=Standardizing global gene expression analysis between laboratories and across platforms |journal=Nat Methods |volume=2 |pages=351–356 |pmid=15846362 |doi=10.1038/nmeth754 |last12=Deng |first12=S |last13=Dressman |first13=HK |last14=Fannin |first14=RD |last15=Farin |first15=FM |last16=Freedman |first16=JH |last17=Fry |first17=RC |last18=Harper |first18=A |last19=Humble |first19=MC |last20=Hurban |first20=P |last21=Kavanagh |first21=TJ |last22=Kaufmann |first22=WK |first23=KF |first24=L |first25=JA |first26=MR |last27=Li |first27=J |first28=YJ |last29=Lobenhofer |first29=EK |last30=Lu |last31=Malek |first31=RL |last32=Milton |first32=S |last33=Nagalla |first33=SR |last34=O'malley |first34=JP |last35=Palmer |first35=VS |last36=Pattee |first36=P |last7=Paules |first7=RS |last38=Perou |first38=CM |last9=Phillips |first39=K |last40=Qin |last41=Qiu |first41=Y |last42=Quigley |first42=SD |last43=Rodland |first43=M |last44=Rusyn |first44=I |last45=Samson |first45= LD|last46= Schwartz|last47=Shi |first47=Y |last48=Shin |last49=Sieber |last50=Slifer |last51=Speer |first51=MC |last52=Spencer |first52=PS |last53=Sproles |first53=DI |last54=Swenberg |first54=JA |last55=Suk|first55= WA |last56=Sullivan |first56=RC |last57=Tian |first57=R |last58=Tennant |first58=RW |last59= Todd |first59=SA |last60=Tucker |first60=CJ |last61=Van Houten |first61=B |last62=Weis |first62=BK |last63=Xuan |first63=S |last64=Zarbl |first64=H |last65=Members Of The Toxicogenomics Research |first65=Consortium |issue=5 |author1=Bammler T, Beyer RP |author2=Consortium, Members of the Toxicogenomics Research |last3=Kerr |last4=Jing |last5=Lapidus |last6=Lasarev |last8=Li |first3=X |first4=LX |first6=DA |first8=JL |first9=SO |first5=S }}&lt;/ref&gt; possibly owing to the small batch sizes and reduced printing efficiencies when compared to industrial manufactures of oligo arrays.

In ''oligonucleotide microarrays'', the probes are short sequences designed to match parts of the sequence of known or predicted [[open reading frame]]s. Although oligonucleotide probes are often used in "spotted" microarrays, the term "oligonucleotide array" most often refers to a specific technique of manufacturing. Oligonucleotide arrays are produced by printing short oligonucleotide sequences designed to represent a single gene or family of gene splice-variants by [[oligonucleotide synthesis|synthesizing]] this sequence directly onto the array surface instead of depositing intact sequences. Sequences may be longer (60-mer probes such as the [[Agilent]] design) or shorter (25-mer probes produced by [[Affymetrix]]) depending on the desired purpose; longer probes are more specific to individual target genes, shorter probes may be spotted in higher density across the array and are cheaper to manufacture.
One technique used to produce oligonucleotide arrays include [[photolithographic]] synthesis (Affymetrix) on a silica substrate where light and light-sensitive masking agents are used to "build" a sequence one nucleotide at a time across the entire array.&lt;ref name="Affy PNAS Paper"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pease AC|author2=Solas D|author3=Sullivan EJ|author4=Cronin MT|author5=Holmes CP|author6=Fodor SP|date= 1994|title=Light-generated oligonucleotide arrays for rapid DNA sequence analysis|journal=PNAS|volume=91|pages=5022–5026|pmid=8197176|doi=10.1073/pnas.91.11.5022|issue=11|pmc=43922}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each applicable probe is selectively "unmasked" prior to bathing the array in a solution of a single nucleotide, then a masking reaction takes place and the next set of probes are unmasked in preparation for a different nucleotide exposure. After many repetitions, the sequences of every probe become fully constructed. More recently, Maskless Array Synthesis from NimbleGen Systems has combined flexibility with large numbers of probes.&lt;ref name="NimbleGen Genome Res Paper"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Nuwaysir EF|author2=Huang W|author3=Albert TJ|author4=Singh J|author5=Nuwaysir K|author6=Pitas A|author7=Richmond T|author8=Gorski T|author9=Berg JP|author10=Ballin J|author11=McCormick M|author12=Norton J|author13=Pollock T|author14=Sumwalt T|author15=Butcher L|author16=Porter D|author17=Molla M|author18=Hall C|author19=Blattner F|author20=Sussman MR|author21=Wallace RL|author22=Cerrina F|author23=Green RD|date= 2002|title=Gene Expression Analysis Using Oligonucleotide Arrays Produced by Maskless Photolithography|journal=Genome Res|volume=12|pages=1749–1755|pmid=12421762|doi=10.1101/gr.362402|issue=11|pmc=187555}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Two-channel vs. one-channel detection ===
[[Image:Microarray-schema.jpg|thumb|right|Diagram of typical dual-colour [[DNA microarray experiment|microarray experiment]] ]]
&lt;!--- channel is the correct word and colour is a bit wrong semantically, see discussion ---&gt;
''Two-color microarrays'' or ''two-channel microarrays'' are typically [[DNA hybridization|hybridized]] with cDNA prepared from two samples to be compared (e.g. diseased tissue versus healthy tissue) and that are labeled with two different [[fluorophore]]s.&lt;ref name="Shalon et al."&gt;{{cite journal|author=Shalon D|author2=Smith SJ|author3=Brown PO|date= 1996|title=A DNA microarray system for analyzing complex DNA samples using two-color fluorescent probe hybridization|journal=Genome Res|volume=6|pages=639–645|pmid=8796352|doi=10.1101/gr.6.7.639|issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fluorescence|Fluorescent]] dyes commonly used for cDNA labeling include [[Cyanine|Cy]]3, which has a fluorescence emission wavelength of 570&amp;nbsp;nm (corresponding to the green part of the light spectrum), and [[Cyanine|Cy]]5 with a fluorescence emission wavelength of 670&amp;nbsp;nm (corresponding to the red part of the light spectrum). The two Cy-labeled cDNA samples are mixed and hybridized to a single microarray that is then scanned in a microarray scanner to visualize fluorescence of the two fluorophores after [[Excited state|excitation]] with a [[laser]] beam of a defined wavelength. Relative intensities of each fluorophore may then be used in ratio-based analysis to identify up-regulated and down-regulated genes.&lt;ref name="Tang et al."&gt;{{cite journal|author=Tang T|author2=François N|author3=Glatigny A|author4=Agier N|author5=Mucchielli MH|author6=Aggerbeck L|author7=Delacroix H|date= 2007|title=Expression ratio evaluation in two-colour microarray experiments is significantly improved by correcting image misalignment|journal=Bioinformatics|volume=23|pages=2686–2691|pmid=17698492|doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btm399|issue=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oligonucleotide microarrays often carry control probes designed to hybridize with [[RNA spike-in]]s. The degree of hybridization between the spike-ins and the control probes is used to [[Normalization (statistics)|normalize]] the hybridization measurements for the target probes. Although absolute levels of gene expression may be determined in the two-color array in rare instances, the relative differences in expression among different spots within a sample and between samples is the preferred method of [[data analysis]] for the two-color system. Examples of providers for such microarrays includes [[Agilent]] with their Dual-Mode platform, [[Eppendorf (company)|Eppendorf]] with their DualChip platform for colorimetric [[Silverquant]] labeling, and TeleChem International with [[Arrayit]].

In ''single-channel microarrays'' or ''one-color microarrays'', the arrays provide intensity data for each probe or probe set indicating a relative level of hybridization with the labeled target. However, they do not truly indicate abundance levels of a gene but rather relative abundance when compared to other samples or conditions when processed in the same experiment. Each RNA molecule encounters protocol and batch-specific bias during amplification, labeling, and hybridization phases of the experiment making comparisons between genes for the same microarray uninformative. The comparison of two conditions for the same gene requires two separate single-dye hybridizations. Several popular single-channel systems are the Affymetrix "Gene Chip", Illumina "Bead Chip", Agilent single-channel arrays, the Applied Microarrays "CodeLink" arrays, and the Eppendorf "DualChip &amp; Silverquant". One strength of the single-dye system lies in the fact that an aberrant sample cannot affect the raw data derived from other samples, because each array chip is exposed to only one sample (as opposed to a two-color system in which a single low-quality sample may drastically impinge on overall data precision even if the other sample was of high quality). Another benefit is that data are more easily compared to arrays from different experiments as long as batch effects have been accounted for.

One channel microarray may be the only choice in some situations. Suppose &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; samples need to be compared: then the number of experiments required using the two channel arrays quickly becomes unfeasible, unless a sample is used as a reference.

===A typical protocol===
This is an example of a '''DNA microarray experiment''', detailing a particular case to better explain DNA microarray experiments, while enumerating possible alternatives.

# The two samples to be compared (pairwise comparison) are grown/acquired. In this example treated sample ([[Case-control|case]]) and untreated sample ([[Case-control|control]]).
# The [[nucleic acid]] of interest is purified: this can be all [[RNA]] for [[expression profiling]], [[DNA]] for [[comparative hybridization]], or DNA/RNA bound to a particular [[protein]] which is [[immunoprecipitated]] ([[ChIP-on-chip]]) for [[Epigenetics|epigenetic]] or regulation studies. In this example total RNA is isolated (total as it is nuclear and [[cytoplasm]]ic) by [[Guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction]] (e.g. [[Trizol]]) which isolates most RNA (whereas column methods have a cut off of 200 nucleotides) and if done correctly has a better purity.
# The purified RNA is analysed for quality (by [[capillary electrophoresis]]) and quantity (for example, by using a [[NanoDrop]] or NanoPhotometer [[spectrometer]]). If the material is of acceptable quality and sufficient quantity is present (e.g., &gt;1[[μg]], although the required amount varies by microarray platform), the experiment can proceed.
# The labelled product is generated via [[reverse transcription]] and sometimes with an optional [[PCR]] amplification. The RNA is reverse transcribed with either polyT primers (which amplify only [[mRNA]]) or random primers (which amplify all RNA, most of which is [[rRNA]]); [[MicroRNA|miRNA]] microarrays ligate an oligonucleotide to the purified small RNA (isolated with a fractionator), which is then reverse transcribed and amplified. The label is added either during the reverse transcription step, or following amplification if it is performed. The [[Sense (molecular biology)|sense]] labelling is dependent on the microarray; e.g. if the label is added with the RT mix, the [[cDNA]] is antisense and the microarray probe is sense, except in the case of negative controls. The label is typically [[fluorescent]]; only one machine uses [[radioactivity in biology|radiolabels]]. The labelling can be direct (not used) or indirect (requires a coupling stage). For two-channel arrays, the coupling stage occurs before hybridization, using [[aminoallyl]] [[uridine]] [[triphosphate]] (aminoallyl-UTP, or aaUTP) and [[N-hydroxysuccinimide|NHS]] amino-reactive dyes (such as [[cyanine|cyanine dyes]]); for single-channel arrays, the coupling stage occurs after hybridization, using biotin and labelled streptavidin. The modified nucleotides (usually in a ratio of 1 aaUTP: 4 TTP (thymidine triphosphate)) are added enzymatically in a low ratio to normal nucleotides, typically resulting in 1 every 60 bases. The aaDNA is then purified with a [[DNA separation by silica adsorption|column]] (using a phosphate buffer solution, as [[Tris]] contains amine groups). The aminoallyl group is an amine group on a long linker attached to the nucleobase, which reacts with a reactive dye. A form of replicate known as a dye flip can be performed to remove any dye effects in two-channel experiments; for a dye flip, a second slide is used, with the labels swapped (the sample that was labeled with Cy3 in the first slide is labeled with Cy5, and vice versa). In this example, [[aminoallyl]]-UTP is present in the reverse-transcribed mixture.
# The labeled samples are then mixed with a propriety [[nucleic acid hybridization|hybridization]] solution which can consist of [[Sodium dodecyl sulfate|SDS]], [[citrate|SSC]], [[dextran|dextran sulfate]], a blocking agent (such as COT1 DNA, salmon sperm DNA, calf thymus DNA, [[PolyA]] or PolyT), [[Denhardt's solution]], or [[Methylamine|formamine]].
# The mixture is denatured and added to the pinholes of the microarray. The holes are sealed and the microarray hybridized, either in a hyb oven, where the microarray is mixed by rotation, or in a mixer, where the microarray is mixed by alternating pressure at the pinholes.
# After an overnight hybridization, all nonspecific binding is washed off (SDS and SSC).
# The microarray is dried and scanned by a machine that uses a laser to excite the dye and measures the emission levels with a detector.
# The image is gridded with a template and the intensities of each feature (composed of several pixels) is quantified.
# The raw data is normalized; the simplest normalization method is to subtract background intensity and scale so that the total intensities of the features of the two channels are equal, or to use the intensity of a reference gene to calculate the [[t-value]] for all of the intensities. More sophisticated methods include [[z-score|z-ratio]], [[local regression|loess and lowess regression]] and RMA (robust multichip analysis) for Affymetrix chips (single-channel, silicon chip, in situ synthesised short oligonucleotides).

== Microarrays and bioinformatics ==
[[Image:Heatmap.png|right|thumb|160px|Gene expression values from microarray experiments can be represented as [[heat map]]s to visualize the result of data analysis.]]

The advent of inexpensive microarray experiments created several specific bioinformatics challenges:

* the multiple levels of replication in experimental design ([[#Experimental design|Experimental design]])
* the number of platforms and independent groups and data format ([[#Standardization|Standardization]])
* the statistical treatment of the data ([[#Data analysis|Data analysis]])
* mapping each probe to the [[mRNA]] transcript that it measures ([[#Annotation|Annotation]])
* the sheer volume of data and the ability to share it ([[#Data warehousing|Data warehousing]])

=== Experimental design ===
Due to the biological complexity of gene expression, the considerations of experimental design that are discussed in the [[expression profiling]] article are of critical importance if statistically and biologically valid conclusions are to be drawn from the data.

There are three main elements to consider when designing a microarray experiment. First, replication of the biological samples is essential for drawing conclusions from the experiment. Second, technical replicates (two RNA samples obtained from each experimental unit) help to ensure precision and allow for testing differences within treatment groups. The biological replicates include independent RNA extractions and technical replicates may be two [[wikt:Special:Search/aliquot|aliquots]] of the same extraction. Third, spots of each cDNA clone or oligonucleotide are present as replicates (at least duplicates) on the microarray slide, to provide a measure of technical precision in each hybridization. It is critical that information about the sample preparation and handling is discussed, in order to help identify the independent units in the experiment and to avoid inflated estimates of [[statistical significance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Fundamentals of experimental design for cDNA microarrays | journal=Nature Genetics |series=supplement |volume=32 |date=2002 | doi=10.1038/ng1031 |url=http://www.vmrf.org/research-websites/gcf/Forms/Churchill.pdf |pages=490–5 |format=– &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=intitle%3AFundamentals+of+experimental+design+for+cDNA+microarrays&amp;as_publication=Nature+genetics+supplement&amp;as_ylo=2002&amp;as_yhi=2002&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; |pmid=12454643 |last1=Churchill |first1=GA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050508225647/http://www.vmrf.org/research-websites/gcf/Forms/Churchill.pdf |archivedate=2005-05-08 |accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Standardization ===
Microarray data is difficult to exchange due to the lack of standardization in platform fabrication, assay protocols, and analysis methods. This presents an [[interoperability]] problem in [[bioinformatics]]. Various [[grass-roots]] [[open source|open-source]] projects are trying to ease the exchange and analysis of data produced with non-proprietary chips:

* For example, the "Minimum Information About a Microarray Experiment" ([[MIAME]]) checklist helps define the level of detail that should exist and is being adopted by many [[Scientific journal|journals]] as a requirement for the submission of papers incorporating microarray results. But MIAME does not describe the format for the information, so while many formats can support the MIAME requirements, {{as of|lc=y|2007}} no format permits verification of complete semantic compliance.
* The "MicroArray Quality Control (MAQC) Project" is being conducted by the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) to develop standards and quality control metrics which will eventually allow the use of MicroArray data in drug discovery, clinical practice and regulatory decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/nctr/science/centers/toxicoinformatics/maqc/ NCTR Center for Toxicoinformatics - MAQC Project&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[MGED Society]] has developed standards for the representation of gene expression experiment results and relevant annotations.

=== Data analysis ===

{{main|Microarray analysis techniques}}
{{See also|Gene chip analysis}}

Microarray data sets are commonly very large, and analytical precision is influenced by a number of variables. [[Statistics|Statistical]] challenges include taking into account effects of background noise and appropriate [[Normalization (statistics)|normalization]] of the data. Normalization methods may be suited to specific platforms and, in the case of commercial platforms, the analysis may be proprietary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prosigna® {{!}}   Prosigna algorithm|url=http://prosigna.com/x-us/overview/prosigna-algorithm/|website=prosigna.com|accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Algorithms that affect statistical analysis include:

* Image analysis: gridding, spot recognition of the scanned image (segmentation algorithm), removal or marking of poor-quality and low-intensity features (called ''flagging'').
* Data processing: background subtraction (based on global or local background), determination of spot intensities and intensity ratios, visualisation of data (e.g. see [[MA plot]]), and log-transformation of ratios, global or [[Local regression|local]] normalization of intensity ratios, and segmentation into different copy number regions using [[step detection]] algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Little|first= M.A.|author2=Jones, N.S.|title=Generalized Methods and Solvers for Piecewise Constant Signals: Part I| journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]]|url=http://www.maxlittle.net/publications/pwc_filtering_arxiv.pdf|date = 2011 |doi=10.1098/rspa.2010.0671|pmid= 22003312|pmc= 3191861|volume=467|issue= 2135|pages=3088–3114}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Class discovery analysis: This analytic approach, sometimes called unsupervised classification or knowledge discovery, tries to identify whether microarrays (objects, patients, mice, etc.) or genes cluster together in groups. Identifying naturally existing groups of objects (microarrays or genes) which cluster together can enable the discovery of new groups that otherwise were not previously known to exist. During knowledge discovery analysis, various unsupervised classification techniques can be employed with DNA microarray data to identify novel clusters (classes) of arrays.&lt;ref name="Peterson"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peterson, Leif E.
|date= 2013|title=Classification Analysis of DNA Microarrays|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=978-0-470-17081-6|url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470170816.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of approach is not hypothesis-driven, but rather is based on iterative pattern recognition or statistical learning methods to find an "optimal" number of clusters in the data. Examples of unsupervised analyses methods include self-organizing maps, neural gas, k-means cluster analyses,&lt;ref&gt;De Souto M et al. (2008) Clustering cancer gene expression data: a comparative study, BMC Bioinformatics, 9(497).&lt;/ref&gt; hierarchical cluster analysis, Genomic Signal Processing based clustering&lt;ref&gt;Istepanian R, Sungoor A, Nebel J-C (2011) Comparative Analysis of Genomic Signal Processing for Microarray data Clustering,  IEEE Transactions on NanoBioscience, 10(4): 225-238.&lt;/ref&gt; and model-based cluster analysis. For some of these methods the user also has to define a distance measure between pairs of objects. Although the Pearson correlation coefficient is usually employed, several other measures have been proposed and evaluated in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jaskowiak|first1=Pablo A|last2=Campello|first2=Ricardo JGB|last3=Costa|first3=Ivan G|title=On the selection of appropriate distances for gene expression data clustering|journal=BMC Bioinformatics|volume=15|issue=Suppl 2|pages=S2|doi=10.1186/1471-2105-15-S2-S2|pmid=24564555|pmc=4072854|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The input data used in class discovery analyses are commonly based on lists of genes having high informativeness (low noise) based on low values of the coefficient of variation or high values of Shannon entropy, etc. The determination of the most likely or optimal number of clusters obtained from an unsupervised analysis is called cluster validity. Some commonly used metrics for cluster validity are the silhouette index, Davies-Bouldin index,&lt;ref&gt;Bolshakova N, Azuaje F (2003) Cluster validation techniques for genome expression data, Signal Processing, Vol. 83, pp. 825–833.&lt;/ref&gt; Dunn's index, or Hubert's &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; statistic. 
* Class prediction analysis: This approach, called supervised classification, establishes the basis for developing a predictive model into which future unknown test objects can be input in order to predict the most likely class membership of the test objects. Supervised analysis&lt;ref name="Peterson"/&gt; for class prediction involves use of techniques such as linear regression, k-nearest neighbor, learning vector quantization, decision tree analysis, random forests, naive Bayes, logistic regression, kernel regression, artificial neural networks, support vector machines, mixture of experts, and supervised neural gas. In addition, various metaheuristic methods are employed, such as genetic algorithms, covariance matrix self-adaptation, particle swarm optimization, and ant colony optimization. Input data for class prediction are usually based on filtered lists of genes which are predictive of class, determined using classical hypothesis tests (next section), Gini diversity index, or information gain (entropy).
* Hypothesis-driven statistical analysis: Identification of statistically significant changes in gene expression are commonly identified using the [[t-test]], [[ANOVA]], [[Bayesian method]]&lt;ref&gt;Ben-Gal I., Shani A., Gohr A., Grau J., Arviv S., Shmilovici A., Posch S. and Grosse I.

&lt;!-- {{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}as in many other cases where authorities disagree, a sound conservative approach is to directly compare different normalization methods to determine the effects of these different methods on the results obtained. This can be done, for example, by investigating the performance of various methods on data from "spike-in" experiments. {{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} --&gt;
* Dimensional reduction: Analysts often reduce the number of dimensions (genes) prior to data analysis.&lt;ref name="Peterson"/&gt; This may involve linear approaches such as principal components analysis (PCA), or non-linear manifold learning (distance metric learning) using kernel PCA, diffusion maps, Laplacian eigenmaps, local linear embedding, locally preserving projections, and Sammon's mapping.
* Network-based methods: Statistical methods that take the underlying structure of gene networks into account, representing either associative or causative interactions or dependencies among gene products.&lt;ref name="Emmert"&gt;{{cite book |author=Emmert-Streib, F.|author2=Dehmer, M.|last-author-amp=yes |date=2008 |title=Analysis of Microarray Data A Network-Based Approach |publisher=Wiley-VCH |isbn=978-3-527-31822-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Weighted Correlation Network Analysis|Weighted gene co-expression network analysis]] is widely used for identifying co-expression modules and intramodular hub genes. Modules may corresponds to cell types or pathways. Highly connected intramodular hubs best represent their respective modules.

Microarray data may require further processing aimed at reducing the dimensionality of the data to aid comprehension and more focused analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== Annotation ===
The relation between a probe and the [[mRNA]] that it is expected to detect is not trivial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barbosa-Morais|first1=N. L.|last2=Dunning|first2=M. J.|last3=Samarajiwa|first3=S. A.|last4=Darot|first4=J. F. J.|last5=Ritchie|first5=M. E.|last6=Lynch|first6=A.

In addition, mRNAs may experience amplification bias that is sequence or molecule-specific. Thirdly, probes that are designed to detect the mRNA of a particular gene may be relying on genomic [[Expressed sequence tag|EST]] information that is incorrectly associated with that gene.

=== Data warehousing ===
Microarray data was found to be more useful when compared to other similar datasets. The sheer volume of data, specialized formats (such as [[MIAME]]), and curation efforts associated with the datasets require specialized databases to store the data. A number of open-source data warehousing solutions, such as [[InterMine]] and [http://www.biomart.org/ BioMart], have been created for the specific purpose of integrating diverse biological datasets, and also support analysis.

== Glossary ==
&lt;!--
For simplicity and to avoid redundancy, this section would contain only terms that are specific to [[DNA Microarry]], but would not be suitable in [[Glossary of gene expression terms]], or in a more general glossary.
--&gt;

* An '''array''' or '''slide''' is a collection of ''[[Glossary of gene expression terms#F|features]]'' spatially arranged in a two dimensional grid, arranged in columns and rows.
* '''Block''' or '''subarray''': a group of spots, typically made in one print round; several subarrays/ blocks form an array.

The '''desert dormouse''' (''Selevinia betpakdalaensis'') is a species of [[rodent]] in the [[dormouse]] [[family (biology)|family]], [[Gliridae]]. This species was formerly placed in its own family, '''Seleviniidae''', but it is now considered to be a dormouse, [[Monotypic taxon|monotypic]] within the genus '''''Selevinia'''''.&lt;ref name = MSW3&gt;{{MSW3 Gliridae | id = 12500039 | pages = 838 | heading = Family Gliridae}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is [[Endemism|endemic]] to [[Kazakhstan]].

==Taxonomy==
The desert dormouse was [[Species description|first described]] in 1939 by Belosludov &amp; Bazhanov as ''Selevinia betpakdalaensis'', the specific name being derived from the [[Betpak-Dala |Betpak-Dala Desert]], west of [[Lake Balkhash]] in [[Kazakhstan]], where the [[Type (biology)|type specimen]] was found. They included it in the rat and mouse [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Muridae]] but later proposed placing it in a new family allied to [[Myoxidae]] (some taxonomists call this family Gliridae), the dormice. By 1947, they had concluded that it should be placed in [[Leithiinae]], a subfamily of Myoxidae, along with three other dormouse genera.&lt;ref name=Rafferty&gt;{{cite book|author=Rafferty, John P.|title=Rats, Bats, and Xenarthrans|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qm86amYgDfMC&amp;pg=PA68 |year=2011 |publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-61530-332-8|pages=68–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
This dormouse has a head-and-body length of between {{convert|75|and|95|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} and a tail of between {{convert|58|and|77|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}. It has a robust, rounded body and soft dense fur, the upper parts being grey and the underparts white. Unusually for a mammal, it sheds the upper layers of its skin with the hairs when it moults, starting at the back of the neck and continuing along the body and flanks, the whole process taking about a month. The tail is well clad with short hairs and the soles of the feet are naked.&lt;ref name=EDGE&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edgeofexistence.org/mammals/species_info.php?id=60 |title=Desert Dormouse (''Selevinia betpakdalaensis'') |publisher=EDGE |accessdate=3 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The upper incisors are large but the cheek teeth are small and barely project through the gums.&lt;ref name=Rafferty/&gt;

==Ecology==
The species lives in sandy or clayey soils in arid habitats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Feldhamer, George A.|title=Mammalogy: Adaptation, Diversity, Ecology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=udCnKce9hfoC&amp;pg=PA359 |year=2007 |publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-0-8018-8695-9 |page=359}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is mainly a [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] animal but does sometimes venture into the open during the day. It mostly walks along in a leisurely fashion but if alarmed, can move faster in a series of short bounds. It lives among desert shrubs such as ''[[Artemisia maritima]]'' and ''[[Salsola laricifolia ]]'' and can climb efficiently. These animals have been little studied in the wild, but in captivity may shelter under rocks and foliage when the weather is warm and only burrow underground during cold periods. It mostly feeds on insects and spiders, but has been known to consume vegetation.&lt;ref name=Rafferty/&gt; It [[Hibernation|hibernates]] during the coldest months of the year, only being active between about March and September.&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt; Pregnant and lactating females have been found in late May and June, with litter sizes of four to eight young being recorded.&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt;

==Status==
''S. betpakdalaensis'' has a large range in Kazakhstan but is not abundant, being known from only about forty individuals scattered over about thirty locations. The total population and its trend are unknown and it may be threatened by the loss of the desert shrubs among which it lives. Because of these uncertainties, the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] has assessed its conservation status as "[[data deficient]]".&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt;

'''''Engineering and the Mind's Eye''''' (1992) is a book by [[Eugene S. Ferguson]], an [[engineer]] and [[history of science and technology|historian of science and technology]].  It was published by [[MIT Press]].  In it, Ferguson discusses the importance of the [[mind's eye]] for the practicing engineer, including [[spatial visualization ability|spatial visualization]] and [[visual thinking]].

A major argument of the book is summarized as follows in the preface:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chris-winter.com/Erudition/Reviews/Technolg/Ferguson_ES/Engr_Mind_Eye.html |title=Review of Engineering and the Mind's Eye  |last1=Winter |first1=Chris |date=June 30, 1998 |website=chris-winter.com |access-date=August 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{blockquote|Since World War II, the dominant trend in engineering has been away from knowledge that cannot be expressed as mathematical relationships. The art of engineering has been pushed aside in favor of the "engineering sciences," which are higher in status and easier to teach. The underlying argument of this book is that an engineering education that ignores its rich heritage of nonverbal learning will produce graduates who are dangerously ignorant of the myriad subtle ways in which the real world differs from the mathematical world their professors teach them.}}

The book comprises 7 chapters and two additional sections on notes about the text and its figures.  The chapters are:
#The Nature of Engineering Design
#The Mind's Eye
#Origins of Modern Engineering
#The Tools of Visualization
#The Development and Dissemination of Engineering Knowledge
#The Making of an Engineer
#The Gap between Promise and Performance.

'''Environmental politics''' designate both the [[politics]] about the [[Natural environment|environment]]&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Dobson, ''Environmental Politics: A Very Short Introduction'', [[Oxford University Press]], 2016 ({{ISBN|978-0-19-966557-0}}).&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[environmental policy]]) and an [[academic field]] of study focused on three core components:&lt;ref name=Carter&gt;Carter, Neil. 2007. ''The Politics of the Environment: Ideas, Activism, Policy'', 2nd ed. New York: [[Cambridge University Press]]. {{ISBN|0-521-68745-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The study of [[Political science|political]] [[Social theory|theories]] and [[Political philosophy|ideas]] related to the [[natural environment|environment]];
* The examination of the environmental stances of both mainstream [[political party|political parties]] and [[environmental movement|environmental social movements]]; and
* The analysis of [[public policy]]making and [[public administration|implementation]] affecting the environment, at multiple [[geopolitics|geo-political]] [[Level of analysis|levels]].

Neil Carter, in his foundational text ''Politics of the Environment'' (2009), suggests that ''environmental'' politics is distinct in at least two ways: first, "it has a primary concern with the relationship between human society and the natural world" (page 3); and second, "unlike most other single issues, it comes replete with its own ideology and political movement" (page 5, drawing on Michael Jacobs, ed., ''Greening the Millenium?'', 1997).&lt;ref name=Carter/&gt;

Further, he distinguishes between modern and earlier forms of environmental politics, in particular [[conservation movement|conservationism]] and [[Wilderness#Preservation|preservationism]]. Contemporary environmental politics "was driven by the idea of a global ecological crisis that threatened the very existence of humanity." And "modern [[environmentalism]] was a political and activist mass movement which demanded a radical transformation in the values and structures of society."&lt;ref name=Carter/&gt;

Environmental concerns were rooted in the vast social changes that took place in the United States after World War II. Although environmentalism can be identified in earlier years, only after the war did it become widely shared social priority. This began with outdoor recreation in the 1950s, extended into the wider field of the protection of natural environments, and then became infused with attempts to cope with air and [[water pollution]] and still later with toxic chemical pollutants. After World War II, environmental politics became a major public concern.&lt;ref&gt;Hays, Samuel P., and Barbara D. Hays. Beauty, Health, and Permanence: Environmental Politics in the United States, 1955-1985. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1987. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The development of environmentalism in the United Kingdom emerged in this period following the great London smog of 1952 and the Torrey Canyon oil spill of 1967.&lt;ref&gt;http://nrl.northumbria.ac.uk/21603/&lt;/ref&gt; This is reflected by the emergence of [[Green politics]] in the Western world beginning in the 1970s.

== Democratic challenges ==
Climate change is slow relative to political cycles of leadership in [[Electoral system|electoral democracies]], which impedes responses by politicians who are elected and re-elected on much shorter timescales.&lt;ref name=Guerrero&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Against Elections: The Lottocratic Alternative|last = Guerrero|first = Alexander|date = 2014|journal = Philosophy &amp; Public Affairs|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, although "environmentalism" was once considered a White phenomenon, scholars have identified "pro-environment positions among Latino, African-American, and non-Hispanic white respondents," with growing environmental concern especially among Latinos.&lt;ref&gt;Whittaker, Matthew, Segura, and Bowler, Shaun (2005). "Racial/Ethnic Group Attitudes Toward Environmental Protection in California: Is "Environmentalism" Still a White Phenomenon?" ''Political Research Quarterly'' (58)3: pp. 435, 435-447.&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars have similarly noted that Asian Americans are strongly pro-environmental, with some variation among ethnic subgroups.&lt;ref&gt;Ong, Paul, Le, Loan and Daniels, Paula (2013) "Ethnic Variation in Environmental Attitudes and Opinion among Asian American Voters." ''AAPI Nexus: Policy, Practice and Community'' (11)1-2: pp. 91-109.&lt;/ref&gt;

Effectively responding to [[global warming]] necessitates some form of international [[environmental governance]] to achieve shared targets related to energy consumption and environmental usage.&lt;ref name=Edmondson&gt;{{Cite book|title = Climate Change and Order|last = Edmondson and Levy|first = |publisher = |year = 2013|isbn = |location = |pages = 50–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climate change complicates political ideology and practice, affecting conceptions of responsibility for future societies as well as economic systems.&lt;ref name=Edmondson/&gt; Material inequality between nations make technological solutions insufficient for climate change mitigation.&lt;ref name=Edmondson/&gt; Rather, political solutions can navigate the particularities of various facets of environmental crisis. Climate change mitigation strategies can be at odds with democratic priorities of prosperity, progress, and state sovereignty, and instead underscore a collective relationship with the environment.

The international political community is presently based on liberal principles that prioritize individual freedoms and capitalist systems that make quick and ambitious climate responses difficult.&lt;ref name=Edmondson/&gt; [[Interest group liberalism|Interest-group liberalism]] is guided by individual human priorities.&lt;ref name=Baber&gt;{{Cite book|title = Deliberative Environmental Politics|last = Baber and Bartlett|first = |publisher = |year = 2005|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Groups unable to voice their self-interest, such as minorities without suffrage, or non-humans, are not included in the political compromise. Addressing environmental crises can be impeded when citizens of liberal democracies do not see environmental problems as impacting their lives, or when they lack the education to evaluate the importance of the problem.&lt;ref name=Mathews&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/alterlj16&amp;div=48&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals|title = Democracy and the Ecological Crisis|last = Mathews|first = Freya|date = 1991|journal = Legal Service Bulletin|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The human benefits from environmental exploitation and protection compete.&lt;ref name=Mathews/&gt; Considering the implications of ecological degradation for future human generations can give environmental concerns a basis in anthropocentric liberal democratic politics.

[[William Ophuls]] posits that liberal democracies are unfit to address environmental problems, and that the prioritization of these challenges would involve a transition to more authoritarian forms of government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Ecology and the Politics of Scarcity |last= Ophuls |first= William |authorlink= William Ophuls |publisher= W.H. Freeman and Company |year=1977 |isbn= |location= San Francisco|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others counter this by pointing to the past successes of environmental reform movements to improve water and air quality in liberal societies.&lt;ref name=Baber/&gt; In practice, environmentalism can improve democracy rather than necessitate its end, by expanding democratic participation and promoting political innovations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Democracy, Bureaucracy and Environmentalism|last = Paehlke|first = Robert| author-link= Robert C. Paehlke|date = 1988|journal = Journal of Environmental Ethics|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tensions between liberal democracy and environmental goals raise questions about the possible limitations of democracy (or at least democracy as we know it): in its responsiveness to subtle but large-scale problems, its ability to work from a holistic societal perspective, its aptness in coping with environmental crisis relative to other forms of government.&lt;ref name=Mathews/&gt; Democracies do not have the provisions to make environmental reforms that are not mandated by voters, and many voters lack incentives or desire to demand policies that could compromise immediate prosperity. The question arises as to whether the foundation of politics is morality or practicality.&lt;ref name=Mathews/&gt; A scheme that conceives of and values the environment beyond its human utility, an [[environmental ethics]], could be crucial for democracies to respond to climate change.&lt;ref name=Mathews/&gt;

== Alternative forms of democracy for environmental policy ==
In political theory, [[deliberative democracy]] has been discussed as a political model more compatible with environmental goals. Deliberative democracy is a system in which informed political equals weigh values, information, and expertise, and debate priorities to make decisions, as opposed to a democracy based on interest aggregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = When the People Speak|last = Fishkin|first = James|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2009|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition of democracy emphasizes informed discussion among citizens in the decision making process, and encourages decisions to benefit the common good rather than individual interests.&lt;ref name=Baber/&gt; Amy Gutmann and Dennis Thompson claimed that reason prevails over self-interest in deliberative democracy, making it a more just system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s7869.html|title = Why Deliberative Democracy|date = 2004|accessdate = |website = Princeton University Press|publisher = |last = Gutmann and Thompson|first = Amy and Dennis}}&lt;/ref&gt; The broad perspective that this discursive model encourages could lead to a stronger engagement with environmental concerns.&lt;ref name=Baber/&gt;

In political theory, the lottery system is a democratic design that allows governments to address problems with future, rather than immediate, impacts. Deliberative bodies composed of randomly selected representatives can draft environmental policies that have short-term costs without considering the political consequences for re-election.&lt;ref name=Guerrero/&gt;

== New materialism and environmental justice ==
New materialism is a strain of thought in philosophy and the social sciences that conceives of all material as having life or agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = New Materialisms: Ontology, Agency, and Politics|last = Coole and Frost|first = |publisher = Duke University Press|year = 2010|isbn = |location = United States|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It criticizes frameworks of justice that center on human attributes like consciousness as insufficient for modern ethical problems that concern the natural environment. It is a post-humanist consideration of all matter that rejects arguments of utility that privilege humans. This politically relevant social theory combats inequality beyond the interpersonal plane.&lt;ref name=Newman&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://isle.oxfordjournals.org/content/9/2/1.extract|title = Marxism and Ecocriticism|last = Newman|first = Lance|date = 2002|journal = Interdiscip Stud Lit Environ|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; People are ethically responsible for one another, and for the physical spaces they navigate, including animal and plant life, and the inanimate matter that sustains it, like soil. New materialism encourages political action according to this world vision, even if it is incompatible with economic growth.&lt;ref name=Newman/&gt;

[[Jane Bennett (political theorist)|Jane Bennett]] uses the term "vital materialism" in her book ''Vibrant Matter: A Political Ecology of Things''. She develops the concept of materialism with the aim of providing a stronger basis in political theory for environmental politics.

New materialists have invoked [[Jacques Derrida|Derrida]] and other historical thinkers to trace the emergence of their philosophy and to justify their environmental claims:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = New Materialism: Interviews and Cartographies|last = Dolphijn and van der Tuin|first = Rick and Iris|publisher = Open Humanities Press|year = 2012|isbn = |location = Ann Arbor|pages = 67–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"No justice ... seems possible or thinkable without the principle of some responsibility, beyond all living present, within that which disjoins the living present, before the ghosts of those who are not yet born or who are already dead [...]. Without this non-contemporaneity with itself of the living present ... without this responsibility and this respect for justice concerning those who are not there, of those who are no longer or who are not yet present and living, what sense would there be to ask the question 'where?' 'where tomorrow?' 'whither?'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Specters of Marx: The State of the Debt, the Work of Mourning and the New International|last = Derrida|first = Jacques|publisher = Routledge|year = 1993|isbn = |location = New York and London|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;All material, living and dead, is interrelated in "the mesh" as described by [[Timothy Morton]]. As all matter is interdependent, humans have obligations to all parts of the material world, including those that are unfamiliar.

New materialism is related to a shift from the view of the environment as a form of capital to a form of labor (see [[Ecosystem services]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/anti.12125/epdf|title = Beyond The Limits to Growth: Ecology and the Neoliberal Counterrevolution|last = Holiday|first = Sara Nelson|date = 2015|journal = Antipode|doi = 10.1111/anti.12125|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Emerging nations ==
Brazil, Russia, India, and China (known as the "[[BRICS|BRIC]]" nations) are rapidly industrializing, and are increasingly responsible for global carbon emissions and the associated climate change. {{citationneeded|date=March 2017}} Other forms of [[environmental degradation]] have also accompanied the economic growth in these nations.&lt;ref name=Shaw&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://carnegieendowment.org/ieb/2012/03/01/choking-on-growth |title=Will Emerging Economies Repeat the Environmental Mistakes of their Rich Cousins? |date=1 March 2012 |accessdate= |website=Carnegie Endowment for International Peace |publisher= |last=Shaw |first=William |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208095237/http://carnegieendowment.org/ieb/2012/03/01/choking-on-growth |archivedate=2015-12-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental degradation tends to motivate action more than the threat of global warming does, since air and water pollution cause immediate health problems, and because pollutants can damage natural resources, hampering economic potential.&lt;ref name=Shaw/&gt;

With rising incomes, environmental degradation tends to decrease in industrializing nations, as depicted in the Environmental Kuznets Curve (described in a section of the [[Kuznets curve|Kuznets Curve]] article). Citizens demand better air and water quality, and technology becomes more efficient and clean when incomes increase.&lt;ref name=Shaw/&gt; The level of income per capita needed to reverse the trend of environmental degradation in industrializing nations varies with the environmental impact indicator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://isecoeco.org/pdf/stern.pdf|title = The Environmental Kuznets Curve|date = June 2003|accessdate = |website = The International Society for Ecological Economics|publisher = |last = Stern|first = David}}&lt;/ref&gt; More developed nations can facilitate eco-friendly transitions in emerging economies by investing in the development of clean technologies. {{citationneeded|date=March 2017}}

Laws implemented in response to environmental concerns vary by nation (see [[List of environmental laws by country]]).

=== China ===
China's environmental ills include acid rain, severe smog, and a reliance on coal-burning for energy.&lt;ref name=Economy&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.cfr.org/china/chinas-environmental-challenge-political-social-economic-implications/p5573|title = China's Environmental Challenge: Political, Social and Economic Implications|date = 27 January 2003|accessdate = |website = Council on Foreign Relations|publisher = |last = Economy|first = Elizabeth}}&lt;/ref&gt; China has instated environmental policies since the 1970s, and has one of the most extensive environmental conservation programs on paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.readcube.com/articles/10.1111%2Fj.1467-9701.2007.00883.x?r3_referer=wol&amp;tracking_action=preview_click&amp;show_checkout=1&amp;purchase_site_license=LICENSE_DENIED_NO_CUSTOMER|title = China's Environment: Problems and Policies|last = MacBean|first = Alasdair|date = 2007|journal = The World Economy|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, regulation and enforcement by the central government in Beijing are weak, so solutions are decentralized.

For history, laws, and policies, see [[Environmental policy in China]].

=== India ===
In 1976, the [[Constitution of India]] was amended to reflect environmental priorities, motivated in part by the potential threat of natural resource depletion to economic growth:&lt;blockquote&gt;"The State shall endeavour to protect and improve the environment and to safeguard the forests and wildlife." (Art. 48A)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"It shall be the duty of every citizen of India [...] to protect and improve the natural environment including forests, lakes, rivers and wildlife, and to have compassion for living creatures." (Art. 51A)&lt;/blockquote&gt;However, in India, as in China, the implementation of written environmental policies, laws, and amendments has proven challenging. Official legislation by the central government (see a partial list at [[Environmental policy of the Government of India]]) is often more symbolic than practical.&lt;ref name=Dembowski&gt;{{Cite book|title = Taking the State to Court: Public Interest Litigation and the Public Sphere in Metropolitan India|last = Dembowski|first = Hans|publisher = Asia House|year = 2001|isbn = |location = online|pages = 63–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ministry of Environment and Forests (India)|Ministry of Environment and Forests]] was established in 1985, but corruption within bureaucratic agencies, namely the influence of wealthy industry leaders, limited any attempts at enforcement of the policies put in place.&lt;ref name=Dembowski/&gt;

[[File:Epitome astronomiae copernicanae.tif|thumb|''Epitome astronomiae copernicanae'' (1618)]]
The '''''Epitome Astronomiae Copernicanae''''' was an astronomy book on the [[heliocentric system]] published by [[Johannes Kepler]] in the period 1617 to 1621. The first volume (books I–III) was printed in 1617, the second (book IV) in 1620, and the third (books V–VII) in 1621.

==Content==
The book contained in particular the first version in print of his [[third law of planetary motion]]. The work was intended as a textbook, and the first part was written by 1615.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Max Caspar|title=Kepler|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cYQUAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA239|date=10 October 2012|publisher=[[Courier Dover Publications]]|isbn=978-0-486-15175-5|page=239}}&lt;/ref&gt; Divided into seven books, the ''Epitome'' covers much of Kepler's earlier thinking, as well as his later positions on physics, metaphysics and archetypes.&lt;ref name="Martens"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rhonda Martens|title=Kepler's Philosophy and the New Astronomy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8ATfXOItxNQC&amp;pg=PA142|date=29 October 2000|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|isbn=0-691-05069-4|page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Book IV he supported the [[Copernican cosmology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[Roy Porter]]|author2=Katharine Park|author3=Lorraine Daston|title=The Cambridge History of Science: Volume 3, Early Modern Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2kvjAp92zcYC&amp;pg=PA41|date=3 July 2006|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-521-57244-6|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Book V provided mathematics underpinning Kepler's views.&lt;ref name="Martens"/&gt; Kepler wrote and published this work in parallel with his ''[[Harmonices Mundi]]'' (1619), the last Books V to VII appearing in 1621.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=J.

The term "[[inertia]]" was first introduced in the ''Epitome''.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Nolan (ed.), ''The Cambridge Descartes Lexicon'', Cambridge University Press, 2016, "Inertia."&lt;/ref&gt;

The first volume was put on the Index of Prohibited Books on 28th of February 1619.&lt;ref&gt; Maurice Finocchiario, Retrying Galileo, 1633-1992, Chapter 1, page 20&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42819">In '''epitranscriptomic sequencing''', most methods focus on either (1) enrichment and purification of the modified RNA molecules before running on the [[RNA sequencer]], or (2) improving or modifying [[bioinformatics]] analysis pipelines to call the modification peaks.  Most methods have been adapted and optimized for [[mRNA]] molecules, except for modified [[bisulfite sequencing]] for profiling [[5-methylcytidine]] which was optimized for [[tRNAs]] and [[rRNA]]s.

[[File:Epitrans workflow.png|thumb|550px|Schematic diagram of epitranscriptomic sequencing workflows.]]

There are six major classes of chemical modifications found in RNA molecules: [[N6-Methyladenosine|N&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-methyladenosine]], [[2'-O-methylation|N6,2'-O-dimethyladenosine]], [[5-Methylcytidine|5-methylcytidine]], [[5-Hydroxymethylcytosine|5-hydroxylmethylcytidine]], [[inosine]], and [[pseudouridine]].&lt;ref name="epitrans_review"&gt;Li, X, Xiong, X., and Yi, C.

Nature Methods. doi:10.1038/NMETH_4110&lt;/ref&gt; Various sequencing methods have been developed to profile each type of modification. The scale, resolution, sensitivity, and limitations associated with each method and the corresponding bioinformatics tools used will be discussed.

== Methods for profiling N&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-methyladenosine  ==

Methylation of [[adenosine]] does not affect its ability to base-pair with [[thymidine]] or [[uracil]], so  [[N6-Methyladenosine|N&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-methyladenosine]] (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) cannot be detected using standard sequencing or [[Nucleic acid hybridization|hybridization]] methods.&lt;ref name = "comprehensive"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Meyer | first1 = K.D. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2012 | title = Comprehensive Analysis of mRNA Methylation Reveals Enrichment in 3'UTRs and near Stop Codons | url = http://www.cell.com/abstract/S0092-8674%2812%2900536-3 | journal = Cell | volume = 149 | issue = 7| pages = 1635–1646 | doi=10.1016/j.cell.2012.05.003| pmid = 22608085 | pmc = 3383396 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This modification is marked by the methylation of the adenosine base at the nitrogen-6 position. It is abundantly found in [[polyA]]+ mRNA; also found in tRNA, rRNA, [[snRNA]], and long [[ncRNA]].

[[File:M6A methods.png|thumb|600px|Methods developed to profile N&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-methyladenosine.]]

=== m6A-seq and MeRIP-seq ===

In 2012, the first two methods for m6A sequencing came out that enabled [[transcriptome]]-wide profile of m6A in mammalian cells.&lt;ref name="epitrans_review" /&gt; These two techniques, called m6A-seq and MeRIP-seq (m6A-specific methylated [[RNA immunoprecipitation]]), are also the first methods to allow for any type of RNA modification sequencing. These methods were able to detect 10,000 m6A peaks in the mammalian transcriptome; the peaks were found to be enriched in 3’UTR regions, near STOP codons, and within long exons.&lt;ref name = "topology"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dominissini | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2012 | title = Topology of the human and mouse m6A RNA methylomes revealed by m6A-seq | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v485/n7397/full/nature11112.html | journal = Nature | volume = 485 | issue = 7397| pages = 201–208 | doi=10.1038/nature11112| pmid =  22575960}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="comprehensive" /&gt;

The two methods were optimized to detect methylation peaks in poly(A)+ mRNA, but the protocol could be adapted to profile any type of RNA. Collected RNA sample is fragmented into ~100-nucleotide-long oligonucleotides using a fragmentation buffer, immunoprecipitation with purified anti-m6A antibody, elution and collection of antibody-tagged RNA molecules. The immunoprecipitation procedure in MeRIP-Seq is able to produce &gt;130fold enrichment of m6A sequences.&lt;ref name="comprehensive" /&gt; Random primed cDNA library generation was performed, followed by adaptor ligation and Illumina sequencing. Since the RNA strands are randomly chopped up, the m6A site should, in principle, lie somewhere in the center of the regions to which sequence reads align. At extremes, the region would be roughly 200nt wide (100nt up- and downstream of the m6A site).&lt;ref name="comprehensive" /&gt;

When the first nucleotide of a transcript is an adenosine, in addition to the ribose 2’-O-methylation, this base can be further methylated at the N6 position.&lt;ref name="epitrans_review" /&gt;
m6A-seq was confirmed to be able to detect m6Am peaks at transcription start sites.&lt;ref name = "perturbation"&gt;Schwartz, S. et al. (2014). [http://www.cell.com/cell-reports/abstract/S2211-1247%2814%2900442-2 Perturbation of m6A Writers Reveals Two Distinct Classes of mRNA Methylation at Internal and 50 Sites]. Cell Reports. 8: 284-296.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "topology"/&gt; Adapter ligation at both ends of RNA fragment results in reads tending to pileup at the 5’ terminus of the transcript. Schwartz et al. (2015) leveraged this knowledge to detect mTSS sites by picking out sites with a high ratio of the size of pileups in the IP samples compared to input sample.&lt;ref name = "topology"/&gt; As confirmation, &gt;80% of the highly enriched pileup sites contained adenosine.

The resolution of these methods is 100-200nt, which was the range of the fragment size. 
These two methods had several drawbacks: (1) required substantial input material, (2) low resolution which made pinpointing the actual site with the m6A mark difficult, and (3) cannot directly assess false positives.&lt;ref name ="high-resolution"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schwartz | first1 = S. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2013 | title = High-Resolution Mapping Reveals a Conserved, Widespread, Dynamic mRNA Methylation Program in Yeast Meiosis | url = http://www.cell.com/abstract/S0092-8674%2813%2901365-2 | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 6| pages = 1409–1421 | doi=10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.047| pmid = 24269006 | pmc = 3956118 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Especially in MeRIP-Seq, the bioinformatics tools that are currently available are only able to call 1 site per ~100-200nt wide peak, so a substantial portion of clustered m6As (~64nt between each individual site within a cluster) are missed.&lt;ref name = "majority"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ke | first1 = S. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2015 | title = A majority of m6A residues are in the last exons, allowing the potential for 3′ UTR regulation | url = http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/early/2015/09/21/gad.269415.115 | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 29 | issue = 19| pages = 2037–2053 | doi=10.1101/gad.269415.115| pmid = 26404942 | pmc = 4604345 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "single-nucleotide-resolution"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Linder | first1 = B. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2015 | title = Single-nucleotide-resolution mapping of m6A and m6Am throughout the transcriptome | url = http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v12/n8/full/nmeth.3453.html | journal = Nature Methods | volume = 12 | issue = 8| pages = 767–772 | doi=10.1038/nmeth.3453| pmid = 26121403 | pmc = 4487409 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each cluster can contain up to 15 m6A residues.&lt;ref name = "majority"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "single-nucleotide-resolution"/&gt;

In 2013, a modified version of m6A-seq based on the previous two methods m6A-seq and MeRIP-seq came out which aimed to increase resolution, and demonstrated this in the yeast transcriptome. They achieved this by decreasing fragment size and employing a ligation-based strand-specific library preparation protocol capturing both ends of the fragmented RNA, ensuring that the methylated position is within the sequenced fragment.&lt;ref name = "high-resolution" /&gt; By additionally referencing the m6A consensus motif and eliminating false positive m6A peaks using negative control samples, the m6A profiling in yeast was able to be done at single-base resolution.

=== UV-based Methods ===

==== PA-m6A-seq  ====
&lt;!-- - incorporate photoactivatable ribonucleoside-enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP)--&gt;
[[CLIP|UV-induced RNA-antibody crosslinking]] was added on top of m6A-seq to produce PA-m6A-seq (photo-crosslinking-assisted m6A-seq) which increases resolution up to ~23nt. First, [[4-thiourodine]] (4SU) is incorporated into the RNA by adding 4SU in [[growth media]], some incorporation sites presumably near m6A location. Immunoprecipitation is then performed on full-length RNA using m6A-specific antibody [36].  UV light at 365&amp;nbsp;nm is then shined onto RNA to activate the crosslinking to the antibody with 4SU. Crosslinked RNA was isolated via [[competition elution]] and fragmented further to ~25-30nt; [[proteinase K]] was used to dissociate the [[covalent bond]] between crosslinking site and antibody.&lt;ref name = "high-resolution" /&gt; Peptide fragments that remain after antibody removal from RNA cause the base to be read as a C as opposed to a T during reverse transcription, effectively inducing a point mutation at the 4SU crosslinking site.&lt;ref name = "high-resolution" /&gt; The short fragments are subjected to library construction and [[Illumina sequencing]], followed by finding the consensus methylation sequence.
The presence of the T to C mutation helps increase the signal to noise ratio of methylation site detection &lt;ref name = "epitrans_review"/&gt; as well as providing greater resolution to the methylation sequence.
One shortcoming of this method is that m6A sites that did not incorporate 4SU can’t be detected.
Another caveat is that position of 4SU incorporation can vary relative to any single m6A residue, so it still remains challenging to precisely locate m6A site using the T to C mutation.

==== m6A-CLIP and miCLIP ====

m6A-CLIP &lt;ref name="majority"/&gt; (crosslinking immunoprecipitation) and miCLIP &lt;ref name ="single-nucleotide-resolution" /&gt; (m6A individual-nucleotide-resolution crosslinking and immunoprecipitation) are UV-based sequencing techniques. These two methods activate crosslinking at 254&amp;nbsp;nm, fragments RNA molecules before immunoprecipitation with antibody, and do not depend on the incorporation of photoactivatable ribonucleosides - the antibody directly crosslinks with a base close (very predictable location) to the m6A site. These UV-based strategies uses antibodies that induces consistent and predictable mutational and truncation patterns in the cDNA strand during reverse-transcription that could be leveraged to more precisely locate the m6A site &lt;ref name="majority"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="single-nucleotide-resolution" /&gt;. Though both m6A-CLIP and miCLIP reply on UV induced mutations, m6A-CLIP &lt;ref name = "majority"/&gt; is distinct by taking advantage that m6A alone can induce cDNA truncation during reverse transcription and generate single-nucleotide mapping for over ten folds more precise m6A sites (MITS, m6A-induced truncation sites), permitting comprehensive and unbiased precise m6A mapping.&lt;ref name = "majority"/&gt; In contrast, UV-mapped m6A sites by miCLIP is only a small subset of total precise m6A sites. The precise location of tens of thousands of m6A sites in human and mouse mRNAs by m6A-CLIP reveals that m6A is enriched at last exon but not around stop codon.&lt;ref name = "majority"/&gt;

In m6A-CLIP &lt;ref name="majority"/&gt; and miCLIP &lt;ref name ="single-nucleotide-resolution" /&gt;, RNA is fragmented to ~20-80nt first, then the 254&amp;nbsp;nm UV-induced covalent RNA/m6A antibody complex was formed in the fragments containing m6A. The antibody was removed with proteinase K before reverse-transcription, library construction and sequencing. Remnants of [[peptide]]s at the crosslinking site on the RNA after antibody removal, leads to insertions, truncations, and [[C to T mutation]]s during [[reverse transcription]] to cDNA, especially at the +1 position to the m6A site (5’ to the m6A site) in the sequence reads.&lt;ref name="majority"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="single-nucleotide-resolution" /&gt;  		 	 	 		
Positive sites seen using m6A-CLIP and miCLIP had high percent of matches with those detected using [[SCARLET]], which has higher local resolution around a specific site, (see below), implicating m6A-CLIP and miCLIP has high spatial resolution and low false discovery rate.&lt;ref name = "majority"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="single-nucleotide-resolution"/&gt; 
miCLIP has been used to detect m6Am by looking at crosslinking-induced truncation sites at the 5’UTR.&lt;ref name ="single-nucleotide-resolution"/&gt;

=== Methods for quantifying m6A modification status ===

Although m6A sites could be profiled at high resolution using UV-based methods, the stoichiometry of m6A sites - the methylation status or the ratio m6A+ to m6A- for each individual site within a type of RNA - is still unknown. SCARLET (2013) and [[m6A-LAIC-seq]] (2016) allows for the quantitation of stoichiometry at a specific locus and transcriptome-wide, respectively.&lt;ref name ="epitrans_review"/&gt;

Bioinformatics methods used to analyze m6A peaks do not make any prior assumptions about the [[sequence motif]]s within which m6A sites are usually found, and take into consideration all possible motifs. Therefore, it is less likely to miss sites.&lt;ref name ="single-nucleotide-resolution"/&gt;

==== SCARLET ====

SCARLET (site-specific cleavage and radioactive-labeling followed by ligation-assisted extraction and thin-layer chromatography) is used determining the fraction of RNA in a sample that carries a methylated adenine at a specific site. One can start with total RNA without having to enrich for the target RNA molecule. Therefore, it is an especially suitable method for quantifying methylation status in low abundance RNAs such as tRNAs. However, it is not suitable or practical for large-scale location of m6A sites.&lt;ref name ="single-nucleotide-resolution"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "scarlet_review"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Maity | first1 = A. | last2 = Das | first2 = B. | year = 2016 | title = N6-methyladenosine modification in mRNA: machinery, function and implications for health and diseases | url = | journal = FEBS Journal | volume = 283 | issue = 9| pages = 1607–1630 | pmid = 26645578 | doi=10.1111/febs.13614}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The procedure begins with a [[chimeric DNA]] [[oligonucleotide]] annealing to the target RNA around the candidate modification site. The chimeric [[ssDNA]] has 2’OMe/2’H modifications and is complementary to the target sequence. The chimeric oligonucleotide serves as a guide to allow [[RNase H]] to cleave the RNA strand precisely at the 5’-end of the candidate site. The cut site is then radiolabeled with phosphorus-32 and [[splint-ligate]]d to a 116nt ssDNA oligonucleotide using [[DNA ligase]].&lt;ref name = "probing"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Liu | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2013 | title = Probing N6-methyladenosine RNA modification status at single nucleotide resolution in mRNA and long noncoding RNA | journal = RNA | volume = 19 | issue = 12| pages = 1848–1856 | pmid = 24141618 | doi=10.1261/rna.041178.113 | pmc=3884656}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[RNase T1/A]] is introduced to the sample to digest all RNA, except for the RNA molecules with the 116-mers DNA attached. This radiolabeled product is then isolated and digested by nuclease to generate a mixture of modified and unmodified adenosines (5’P-m6A and 5’-P-A) which is separated using thin layer chromatography. The relative proportions of the two groups can be determined using UV absorption levels.&lt;ref name = "scarlet_review"/&gt;

====  m6A-LAIC-seq ====

m6A-LAIC-seq (m6A-level and isoform-characterization sequencing) is a high-throughput approach to quantify methylation status on a whole-transcriptome scale. Full-length RNA samples are used in this method. RNAs are first subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-m6A antibody. Excess antibody is added to the mixture to ensure all m6A-containing RNAs are pulled down. The mixture is separated into eluate (m6A+ RNAs) and supernatant (m6A- RNAs) pools. [[External RNA Controls Consortium]] (ERCC) [[spike in]]s are added to the eluate and supernatant, as well as an independent control arm consisting of just ERCC spike in. After antibody cleavage in the eluate pool, each of the three mixtures are sequenced on a next generation sequencing platform. The m6A levels per site or gene could be quantified by the ERCC-normalized RNA abundances in different pools.&lt;ref name = "epitrans_review" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "m6A-LAIC-seq"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Molinie | first1 = B. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2016 | title = m6A-LAIC-seq reveals the census and complexity of the m6A epitranscriptome | url = http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v13/n8/abs/nmeth.3898.html | journal = Nature Methods | volume = 13 | issue = 8| pages = 692–698 | doi=10.1038/nmeth.3898| pmid = 27376769 | pmc = 5704921 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since full-length RNA is used, it is possible to directly compare alternatively spliced isoforms between the m6A+ and m6A- fractions as well as comparing isoform abundance within the m6A+ portion.

Despite the advances in m6A-sequencing, several challenges still remain: (1) A method has yet to be developed that characterizes the stoichiometry between different sites in the same transcript; (2) Analysis results are heavily dependent on the [[bioinformatics algorithm]] used to call the peaks; (3) Current methods all use m6A-specific antibodies to tag m6A sites, but it has been reported that the antibodies contain intrinsic bias for RNA sequences.

== Methods for N6,2'-O-dimethyladenosine (m6Am) Profiling ==
[[N6,2'-O-dimethyladenosine]], abundant in [[polyA+]] mRNAs, occurs at the first nucleotide after the [[5’ cap]], when an additional methyl group is added to a [[2ʹ-O-methyladenosine]] residue at the ‘capped’ 5ʹ end of mRNA.&lt;ref name = "epitrans_review"/&gt;

Since m6Am can be recognized by [[anti-m6A antibodies]] at [[transcription start site]]s, the methods used for m6A profiling can be and were adapted for m6Am profiling, namely m6A-seq, and [[miCLIP]] (see m6A-seq and miCLIP descriptions above).

== Methods for 5-methylcytidine profiling ==

[[File:M5C methods v3.png|thumb|600px|Methods developed to profile 5-methylcytidine.]]

[[5-methylcytidine]], m5C, is abundantly found in mRNA and ncRNAs, especially tRNA and rRNAs. In tRNAs, this modification stabilizes the [[secondary structure]] and influences [[anticodon stem-loop conformation]].&lt;ref name = "epitrans_review"/&gt; In rRNAs, m5C affects [[translational fidelity]].&lt;ref name = "epitrans_review"/&gt;

Two principles have been used to develop m5C sequencing methods. The first one is antibody-based approach (bisuphite sequencing and [[m5C-RIP]]), similar to m6C sequencing. The second is detecting targets of m5C RNA methyltransferases by covalently linking the enzyme to its target, and then using IP specific to the target enzyme to enrich for RNA molecules containing the mark (Aza-IP and miCLIP).

&lt;!--[include general illustration]--&gt;

=== Modified bisulfite sequencing ===

Modified bisulfite sequencing was optimized for rRNA, tRNA, and miRNA molecules from [[Drosophila]].&lt;ref name = "RNA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schaefer | first1 = M. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2008 | title = RNA cytosine methylation analysis by bisulphite sequencing | url = | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 37 | issue = 2| page = e12 | doi=10.1093/nar/gkn954| pmid = 19059995 | pmc = 2632927 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Bisulfite treatment has been most widely used to detect dm5C ([[DNA m5C]]). The treatment essentially converts a [[cytosine]] to a [[uridine]], but [[methylated cytosine]]s would be unchanged by the treatment.
Previous attempts to develop m5C sequencing protocols using bisulfite treatment were not able to effectively address the problem of the harsh treatment of RNA which causes significant degradation of the molecules. Specifically, [[bisulfite deamination]] treatment (high pH) of RNA is detrimental to the stability of [[phosphodiester bond]]s. As a result, it is difficult to pre-enrich RNA molecules or to obtain enough PCR product of the correct size for [[deep sequencing]].

A modified version of bisulfite sequencing was developed by Schaefer et al. (2009) which decreased the temperature at which bisulfite treatment of RNA from 95&amp;nbsp;°C to 60&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name = "RNA"/&gt; The rationale behind the modification was that since RNA, unlike DNA, is not double-stranded, but rather, consists of regions of single-strandedness, double-stranded stem structures and loops, it could be possible to unwind RNA at a much lower temperature. Indeed, RNA could be treated for 180 minutes at 60C without significant loss of [[PCR amplicon]]s of the expected size.&lt;ref name = "RNA"/&gt; Deamination rates were determined to be 99% at 180min of treatment.

After bisulfite treatment of fragmented RNA, reverse transcription is performed, followed by [[PCR amplification]] of the cDNA products, and finally deep sequencing was done using the [[Roche 454]] platform.&lt;ref name = "RNA"/&gt;

Since the developers of the method used the Roche platform, they also used [[GS Amplicon Variant Analyzer]] (Roche) for analyzing deep sequencing data to quantify sequence-specific cytosine content.
However, recent papers have suggested that the method have several flaws: (1) Incomplete conversion of regular cytosines in double-stranded regions of RNA; (2) areas containing other modifications that resulted in bisulfite-treatment resistance; and (3) sites containing potential false-positives due to (1) and (2) &lt;ref name="messenger"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gilbert | first1 = W.V. | last2 = Bell | first2 = T.A. | last3 = Schaening | first3 = C. | year = 2016 | title = Messenger RNA modifications: form, distribution, and function | journal = Science | volume = 352 | issue = 6292| pages = 1408–1412 | pmid = 27313037 | doi=10.1126/science.aad8711 | pmc=5094196}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="characterizing"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hussain | first1 = S. | last2 = Aleksic | first2 = J. | last3 = Blanco | first3 = S. | last4 = Dietmann | first4 = S. | last5 = Frye | first5 = M. | year = 2013 | title = Characterizing 5-methylcytosine in the mammalian epitranscriptome | journal = Genome Biol | volume = 14 | issue = 11| page = 215 | doi=10.1186/gb4143| pmid = 24286375 | pmc = 4053770 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="the_emerging_transcriptome"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shafik | first1 = A. | last2 = Schumann | first2 = U. | last3 = Evers | first3 = M. | last4 = Sibbritt | first4 = T. | last5 = Preiss | first5 = T. | year = 2016 | title = The emerging epitranscriptomics of long noncoding RNAs | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187493991500231X | journal = Biochim.

=== Aza-IP ===

Aza-IP [[5-azacytidine-mediated RNA immunoprecipitation]] has been optimized on and used for detecting targets of [[methyltransferases]], particularly [[NSUN2]] and [[DNMT2]] &lt;ref name = "identification"&gt;Khoddami, V. and Cairns, B.R. (2013). [http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v31/n5/full/nbt.2566.html Identification of direct targets and modified bases of RNA cytosine methyltransferases]. Nature Biotechnology. 31(5): 459-464.&lt;/ref&gt; — the two main enzymes responsible for laying down the m5C mark.

First, the cell is made to [[overexpress]] an [[epitope]]-tagged m5C-RNA methytransferase derivative so that the antibody used later on for immunoprecipitation could recognize the enzyme. Second, [[5-aza-C]] is introduced to the cells so that it could be incorporated into nascent RNA in place of cytosine. Normally, the methyltransferases are released (i.e. covalent bond between cytosine and methyltransferase is broken) following methylation of the residue. For 5-aza-C, due to a nitrogen substitution in the C5 position of cytosine, the RNA methytransferase enzyme remains covalently bound to the target RNA molecule at the C6 position.&lt;ref name = "identification"/&gt;

Third, the cell is [[lysed]] and the m5C-RNA methyltransferase of interest is immunoprecipitated along with the RNA molecules that are covalently linked to the protein. The IP step enabled &gt;200-fold enrichment of RNA targets, which were mainly tRNAs. The enriched molecules were then fragmented and purified. cDNA library is then constructed and sequencing is performed.&lt;ref name = "identification"/&gt;

An important additional feature is that RNA methyltransferase covalent linkage to the C5 of m-aza-C induces rearrangement and [[ring opening]]. This ring opening results in preferential pairing with cytosine and is therefore read as guanosine during sequencing. This C to G transversion allows for base resolution detection of m5C sites.&lt;ref name = "epitrans_review"/&gt; 
One caveat is that m5C sites not replaced by 5-azacytosine will be missed.

=== miCLIP  ===

miCLIP ([[Methylation induced crosslinking immunoprecipitation]]) was used to detect [[NSUN2]] targets, which were found to be mostly [[non-coding RNA]]s such as tRNA. An induced mutation of C271A in NSUN2 inhibits release of enzyme from RNA target. This mutation was over-expressed in the cells of interest, and the mutated NSUN2 was also tagged with the [[Myc epitope]]. The covalently linked RNA-protein complexes are isolated via immunoprecipitation for a Myc-specific antibody. These complexes are confirmed and detected by [[radiolabeling]] with [[phosphorus-32]]. The RNA is then extracted from the complex, reverse-transcribed, amplified with PCR, and sequenced using next-generation platforms.

Both miCLIP and Aza-IP, though limited by specific targeting of enzymes, can allow for the detection of low-abundance methylated RNA without deep sequencing.&lt;ref name="epitrans_review"/&gt;

== Methods for Inosine Profiling ==

[[Inosine]] is created enzymatically when an adenosine residue is modified.

[[File:Identification of inosine.png|thumb|400px|Method of inosine identification: Inosine base pairs with cytidine while adenosine pairs with uracil.]]

=== Analysis of base-pairing properties ===
Since the chemical makeup of inosine is a deaminated adenosine, this is one of few methylation alterations that has an accompanying alteration in base pairing, which can be capitalised on. The original adenosine nucleotide will pair with a thymine, whereas the methylated inosine will pair with a cytosine. cDNA sequences obtained by [[rtPCR]] can therefore be compared to the corresponding genomic sequences; in sites where A residues are repeatedly interpreted as G, a methylation event can be assumed. At high enough accuracy, it is feasible that the quantity of mRNA molecules in the population that have been methylated can be calculated as a percentage. This method potentially has single-nucleotide resolution. In fact, the abundance of RNA-seq data that is now publicly available can be leveraged to investigate G (in cDNA) versus A (in genome). One particular pipeline, called RNA and DNA differences (RDD), claims to excludes false positives, but only 56.8% of its A-to-I sites were found to be valid by ICE-seq&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sakurai | first1 = M. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2014 | title = A biochemical landscape of A-to-I RNA editing in the human brain transcriptome | url = | journal = Genome Res | volume = 24 | issue = 3| pages = 522–534 | doi=10.1101/gr.162537.113| pmid = 24407955 | pmc = 3941116 }}&lt;/ref&gt;(see below).

==== Limitations ====
The background noise caused by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), somatic mutations, pseudogenes and sequencing errors reduce the reliability of the signal, especially in a single-cell context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0020391 | pmid=15534692 | pmc=526178 | volume=2 | issue=12 | title=Widespread A-to-I RNA Editing of Alu-Containing mRNAs in the Human Transcriptome | journal=PLoS Biology | page=e391| year=2004 | last1=Athanasiadis | first1=Alekos | last2=Rich | first2=Alexander | last3=Maas | first3=Stefan }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chemical methods ===

==== Inosine-specific cleavage ====
The first method to detect A-to-I RNA modifications, developed in 1997, was inosine-specific cleavage. RNA samples are treated with glyoxal and borate to specifically modify all G bases, and subsequently enzymatically digested to by RNase T1, which cleaves after I sites. The amplification of these fragments then allows analysis of cleavage sites and inference of A-to-I modification.
.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Morse | first1 = D.P. | last2 = Bass | first2 = B.L. | year = 1997 | title = Detection of inosine in messenger RNA by inosine-specific cleavage | url = | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 36 | issue = 28| pages = 8429–8434 | doi=10.1021/bi9709607| pmid = 9264612 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was used to prove the position of inosine at specific sites rather than identify novel sites or transcriptome-wide profiles.

===== Limitations =====
The existence of two A-to-I modifications in relatively close proximity, which is common in Alu elements, means the downstream mod is less likely to be detected since the cDNA synthesis will be truncated at a prior nucleotide. The throughput is low, and the initial method required specific primers; the protocol is complicated and labour-intensive.

==== ICE and ICE-seq ====
Inosine chemical erasing (ICE) refer to a process in which acrylonitrile is reacted with inosine to form N1-cyanoethylinosine (ce1I). This serves to stall reverse transcriptase and lead to truncated cDNA molecules. This was combined with deep-sequencing in a developed method called ICE-seq. Computational methods for automated analysis of the data are available, the main premise being the comparison of treated and untreated samples to identify truncated transcripts and thus infer an inosine modification by read count, with a step to reduce false positives by comparison to online database dbSNP.&lt;ref name="Masayuki Sakurai 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sakurai | first1 = Masayuki | last2 = Yano | first2 = Takanori | last3 = Kawabata | first3 = Hitomi | last4 = Ueda | first4 = Hiroki | last5 = Suzuki | first5 = Tsutomu | year = 2010 | title = Inosine cyanoethylation identifies A-to-I RNA editing sites in the human transcriptome | url = | journal = Nature Chemical Biology | volume = 6 | issue = 10| pages = 733–740 | doi = 10.1038/nchembio.434 | pmid = 20835228 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Limitations =====
The original ICE protocol involved an [[RT-PCR amplification]] step and therefore required primers and knowledge of the location or regions to be investigated,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Morse | first1 = D. P. | last2 = Bass | first2 = B. L. | year = 1997 | title = Detection of inosine in messenger RNA by inosine-specific cleavage | url = | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 36 | issue = 28| pages = 8429–8434 | doi=10.1021/bi9709607| pmid = 9264612 }}&lt;/ref&gt; alongside a maximum cDNA length of 300–500bp.
The ICE-seq method is complicated, along with being labour-, reagent- and time-intensive. One protocol from 2015 took 22 days.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Masayuki Sakurai 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; This shares a limitation with inosine-specific cleavage, in that if there are two A-to-I modifications in relatively close proximity, the downstream mod is less likely to be detected since the cDNA synthesis will be truncated at a prior nucleotide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Suzuki | first1 = Tsutomu | last2 = Ueda | first2 = Hiroki | last3 = Okada | first3 = Shunpei | last4 = Sakurai | first4 = Masayuki | year = 2015 | title = Transcriptome-wide identification of adenosine-to-inosine editing using the ICE-seq method | url = | journal = Nature Protocols | volume = 10 | issue = 5| pages = 715–732 | doi=10.1038/nprot.2015.037| pmid = 25855956 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Both ICE and ICE-seq suffer from a lack of sensitivity to infrequently edited locations: it becomes difficult to distinguish a modification with a frequency of &lt;10% from a false positive. An increase in read depth and quality can increase sensitivity, but also then suffer from further amplification bias.

=== Biological methods ===

==== ADAR knockdown ====
The modification of A to I is effected by adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADARs), of which in mice there are three. The knockdown of these in the cell, therefore, and the subsequent cell–cell comparison of ADAR+ and ADAR- RNA content would be anticipated to provide a basis for A-to-I modification profiling. However, there are further functions of ADAR enzymes within the cell — for example, they have further roles in RNA processing, and in miRNA biogenesis — which would also be likely to change the landscape of cellular mRNA.

===== Limitations =====
The high incidence of side effects rule out ADAR knockdown as a categorical A-to-I detection method. Moreover, since ADAR knockout results in embryonic lethality,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wang | first1 = Q. | last2 = Khillan | first2 = J. | last3 = Gadue | first3 = P. | last4 = Nishikura | first4 = K. | year = 2000 | title = Requirement of the RNA editing deaminase ADAR1 gene for embryonic erythropoiesis | url = | journal = Science | volume = 290 | issue = 5497| pages = 1765–1768 | doi=10.1126/science.290.5497.1765}}&lt;/ref&gt; its utility is restricted to cultured cells.

== Methods for Pseudouridine Methylation Profiling ==

[[File:Stalling of reverse transcriptase.png|thumb|350px|ICE-based and CMC-based detection of inosine and pseudouridine. In both cases a truncated cDNA molecule is produced.]]

[[Pseudouridine]], or Ψ, the overall most abundant [[post-translational modification|post-translational RNA modification]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Charette | first1 = M. | last2 = Gray | first2 = M.W. | year = 2000 | title = Pseudouridine in RNA: what, where, how, and why | url = | journal = IUBMB Life | volume = 49 | issue = | pages = 341–351 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is created when a uridine base is isomerised.

=== Biochemical methods ===

==== CMCT methods ====

There are multiple pseudouridine detection methods beginning with the addition of N-cyclohexyl-N′-b-(4-methylmorpholinium) ethylcarbodiimide metho-p-toluene-sulfonate (CMCT; also known as CMC), since its reaction with pseudouridine produces CMC-Ψ.  CMC-Ψ causes reverse transcriptase to stall one nucleotide in the 3’ direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bakin | first1 = A. | last2 = Ofengand | first2 = J. | year = 1993 | title = Four newly located pseudouridylate residues in Escherichia coli 23S ribosomal RNA are all at the peptidyltransferase center: analysis by the application of a new sequencing technique | url = | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 32 | issue = 37| pages = 9754–9762 | doi=10.1021/bi00088a030}}&lt;/ref&gt; These methods have single-nucleotide resolution.
In an optimisation step, azido-CMC can confer the ability to add [[biotin]]ylation; subsequent biotin pulldown will enrich Ψ-containing transcripts, allowing identification of even low-abundance transcripts.

===== Limitations =====
As with other procedures predicated on biochemical alteration followed by sequencing, the development of [[next-generation sequencing|high-throughput sequencing]] has removed the limitations requiring prior knowledge of sites of interest and [[primer (molecular biology)|primer]] design. The method causes a lot of RNA degradation, so it is necessary to start with a large amount of sample, or use effective [[normalisation (chemistry)|normalisation]] techniques to account for [[amplification biases]]. One final limitation is that, for CMC labelling of pseudouridine to be specific, it is not complete, and therefore nor is it quantitative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kellner | first1 = S. | last2 = Burhenne | first2 = J. | last3 = Helm | first3 = M. | year = 2010 | title = Detection of RNA modifications | url = | journal = RNA Biol. | volume = 7 | issue = 2| pages = 237–247 | doi=10.4161/rna.7.2.11468}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new reactant that could achieve a higher sensitivity with specificity would be beneficial.

== Methods for 5-hydroxylmethylcytidine Profiling ==

Cytidine residues, modified once to m5C (discussed above), can be further modified: either [[oxidised]] once for 5-hydroxylmethylcytidine (hm5C), or oxidised twice for 5-formylcytidine (f5C). Arising from the oxidative processing of m5C enacted in [[mammal]]s by ten-eleven translocation ([[TET]]) family enzymes, hm5C is known to occur in all three [[kingdom (biology)|kingdom]]s and to have roles in regulation. While 5-hydroxymethylcytidine (hm5dC) is known to be found in DNA in a widespread manner, hm5C is also found in organisms for which no hm5dC has been detected, indicating it is a separate process with distinct regulatory stipulations. To observe the ''in vivo'' addition of methyl groups to cytosine RNA residues followed by oxidative processing, [[mice]] can be fed on a diet incorporating particular [[isotope]]s and these be traced by LC-[[mass spectrometry|MS/MS]] analysis. Since the metabolic pathway from nutritional intake to nucleotide incorporation is known to progress from dietary [[methionine]] --&gt; [[S-adenosylmethionine]] (SAM) --&gt; methyl group on RNA base, the labelling of dietary methionine with &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C and D means these will end up in hm5C residues that have been altered since the addition of these into the diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Huber | first1 = Sabrina M. | last2 = van Delft | first2 = Pieter | last3 = Mendil | first3 = Lee | last4 = Bachman | first4 = Martin | last5 = Smollett | first5 = Katherine | last6 = Werner | first6 = Finn | last7 = Miska | first7 = Eric A. | last8 = Balasubramanian | first8 = Shankar | year = 2015 | title = Formation and Abundance of 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine in RNA | url = | journal = ChemBioChem | volume = 16 | issue = 5| pages = 752–755 | doi=10.1002/cbic.201500013| pmid = 25676849 | pmc = 4471624 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to m5C, a large quantity of hm5C modifications have been recorded within coding sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Delatte | first1 = B. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2016 | title = RNA biochemistry.

=== hMeRIP-seq ===

hMeRIP-seq is an immunoprecipitation method, in which RNA–protein complexes are crosslinked for stability, and antibodies specific to hm5C are added. Using this method, over 3,000 hm5C peaks have been called in ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' S2 cells.

==== Limitations ====

Despite two distinct base-resolution methods being available for hm5dC, there are no base-resolution methods for detection of hm5C.

'''Explorer 15''', also called '''EPE-C''', was an [[United States|American]] [[satellite]] launched as part of [[Explorers program]]. Explorer 15 as launched on October 27, on [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]], [[Florida]], [[United States]], with [[Delta rocket]].

==Mission==
Explorer 15 was a spin-stabilized, [[solar-cell]] powered spacecraft instrumented to study the artificial radiation belt produced by the Starfish high-altitude nuclear burst of July 1962. The backup payload for Explorer 14 was modified and used for Explorer 15. The instrumentation included three sets of particle detectors to study both electrons and protons, and a two-axis fluxgate [[magnetometer]] to determine magnetic aspect. A 16-channel PFM/PM time-division multiplexed telemeter was used. The time required to sample the 16 channels (one frame period) was 0.323 s. Half of the channels were used to convey eight-level digital information, and the others were used for analog information. During ground processing of the telemetered data, the analog information was digitized with an accuracy of 1/100th of full scale. 

One analog channel was subcommutated in a pattern 16 frames long and was used to telemeter spacecraft [[temperature]]s, power system [[voltage]]s, [[electric currents]], etc. A digital solar aspect sensor measured the spin period and phase, digitized to 0.041 s, and the angle between the spin axis and the sun direction to about 3° intervals. During launch the spacecraft failed to despin. The spin rate ranged from 72.9 to 73.2 rpm during the life of the spacecraft. The spin axis pointed at right ascension 80.97° and declination 20.9°.&lt;ref name="nssdc"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8359">:''For the county code, see [[FIPS county code]].''
'''Federal Information Processing Standards''' ('''FIPS''') are publicly announced [[standardization|standards]] developed by the [[United States federal government]] for use in computer systems by non-military government agencies and government contractors.&lt;ref name=GenInfo&gt;{{ cite web | url = https://www.nist.gov/itl/fipsinfo.cfm | title = FIPS General Information | date = 2013-09-09 | accessdate = 2015-04-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

FIPS standards are issued to establish requirements for various purposes such as ensuring computer security and interoperability, and are intended for cases in which suitable industry standards do not already exist.&lt;ref name="GenInfo"/&gt; Many FIPS specifications are modified versions of standards used in the technical communities, such as the [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI), the  [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE), and the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO).

==Specific areas of FIPS standardization==
The U.S. government has developed various FIPS specifications to standardize a number of topics including:
* Codes: for instance, standards for encoding data (such as [[FIPS county code]]s or codes to indicate weather conditions or emergency indications). In 1994 [[NOAA]] began broadcasting coded signals called FIPS codes along with their standard weather broadcasts from local stations. These codes identify the type of emergency and the specific geographic area, such as a county, affected by the emergency.
* Encryption standards, such as the [[Data Encryption Standard]] (FIPS 46-3&lt;ref&gt;[http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips46-3/fips46-3.pdf FIPS 46-3]&lt;/ref&gt;) and the [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] (FIPS 197&lt;ref&gt;[http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips197/fips-197.pdf FIPS 197]&lt;/ref&gt;)

==Data security standards==
Some FIPS standards have related to the security of data processing systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips200/FIPS-200-final-march.pdf | title = Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems | date = 2007-03-01 | accessdate = 2015-04-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these included the use of [[key escrow]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://www.ittoday.info/AIMS/DSM/87-20-20.pdf | title = 87-20-20 Key Escrow Encryption Policies and Technologies | date = 1998-06-01 | accessdate = 2015-02-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips185/fips185.pdf | title = FIPS-185 Escrowed Encryption Standard | date = 1994-02-01 | accessdate = 2015-04-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Withdrawal of geographic codes==
Some examples of FIPS Codes for geographical areas include FIPS 10-4 for [[List of FIPS country codes|country codes]] or [[List of FIPS region codes|region codes]] and FIPS 5-2 for [[FIPS state code|state codes]]. These codes were similar to or comparable with, but not the same as, [[ISO 3166]], or the [[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics|NUTS]] standard of the [[European Union]]. In 2002, the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) withdrew several geographic FIPS code standards, including those for countries (FIPS 10-4), [[U.S. state]]s (FIPS 5-2), and [[county (United States)|counties]] ([[FIPS county code|FIPS 6-4]]).&lt;ref name=withdraw&gt;{{cite web |author=[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] |url=https://www.nist.gov/itl/upload/Withdrawn-FIPS-by-Numerical-Order-Index.pdf|date=2012-10-22
|title=Withdrawn FIPS Listed by Number |publisher=[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] |accessdate=2013-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fr&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getpage.cgi?position=all&amp;page=51276&amp;dbname=2008_register |title=Announcing Approval of the Withdrawal of Ten Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) |first=James M. |last=Turner |work=[[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]] |publisher=[[Federal Register]] |volume=73 |page=51276 |date=2008-09-02 |accessdate=2017-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These are to be replaced by ISO 3166 and [[International Committee for Information Technology Standards|INCITS]] standards 38 and 31, respectively.&lt;ref name="replacement_chart" /&gt; Some of the codes maintain the previous numerical system, particularly for states.&lt;ref name=ansi&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/ansi/ansi.html |title=American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Codes |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |date=February 24, 2010 |accessdate=2010-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, NIST withdrew the FIPS 55-3 database.&lt;ref name=withdraw/&gt; This database included 5-digit numeric place codes for cities, towns, and villages, or other centers of population in the United States. The codes were assigned alphabetically to places within each state, and as a result changed frequently in order to maintain the alphabetical sorting. NIST replaced these codes with the more permanent [[Geographic Names Information System|GNIS]] Feature ID, maintained by the [[U.S. Board on Geographic Names]]. The GNIS database is the official geographic names repository database for the United States, and is designated the only source of geographic names and locative attributes for use by the agencies of the Federal Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=FIPS 55 Change Notice| publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]] | url=http://geonames.usgs.gov/docs/fips55_change.pdf |format=[[portable document format|PDF]]|date=January 1, 2006 |accessdate=2010-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  FIPS 8-6 "Metropolitan Areas" and 9-1 "Congressional Districts of the U.S." were also withdrawn in 2008, to be replaced with [[International Committee for Information Technology Standards|INCITS]] standards 454 and 455, respectively.&lt;ref name="replacement_chart"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nist.gov/itl/upload/FIPSCodesReplacementChart2012.pdf|publisher=[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] |date=2012-06-28|accessdate=2013-03-06|title=FIPS Code Replacement Chart 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[U.S. Census Bureau]] used FIPS place codes database to identify legal and statistical entities for county subdivisions, places, and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian]] areas, [[Alaska Native]] areas, or [[Native Hawaiian|Hawaiian home lands]] when they needed to present census data for these areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS)| publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/meta/long_fips.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140207223104/http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/meta/long_fips.htm|archive-date=2014-02-07|accessdate=2010-08-03|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the NIST decision, the Census Bureau is in the process of transitioning over to the GNIS Feature ID, which will be completed after the [[United States Census, 2010|2010 Census]]. Until then, previously issued FIPS place codes, renamed "Census Code," will continue to be used, with the Census bureau assigning new codes as needed for their internal use during the transition.&lt;ref name=ansi/&gt;&lt;ref name=transition&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/maps-data/data/tiger/tgrshp2009/TGRSHP09C3.pdf |title=2009 TIGER/Line Shapefiles Technical Documentation |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |year=2009 |format=[[portable document format|PDF]] |accessdate=2010-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''FreeHAL''' is a [[distributed computing]] project to build a self-learning [[Chatterbot|chatbot]]. This project is no longer active.&lt;ref name="FreeHAL stats"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://boincstats.com/stats/project_graph.php?pr=freehal | title = BOINC Stats&amp;nbsp;— FreeHAL | publisher = [[BOINC]] | date = 2011-08-04 | accessdate = 2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Name ==
First, the program was called ''JEliza'' referring to the chatbot [[ELIZA]] by [[Joseph Weizenbaum]].
The ''J'' stood for [[Java (programming language)|Java]] because JEliza has first been programmed in Java. In May 2008, the program has been renamed to ''FreeHAL'' because the programming language has changed. Since that time the name is related to the computer in the film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''.

==Functionality==
FreeHAL uses a [[semantic network]] and technologies like [[pattern recognition]], [[stemming]], part of speech databases and [[Hidden Markov Model]]s in order to imitate a human behaviour.
FreeHAL learns autonomously. While communicating by keyboard the program extends its database.
Currently, English and German are supported.

==FreeHAL@home==
By using the [[BOINC]] infrastructure,  new semantic networks for the program are built. FreeHAL@home appears to have terminated operations.

==Awards==
In 2008, the program won the first prize in the category "Most Popular" at the [[Chatterbox Challenge]], a yearly competition between different similar chatbots.

==Publications==
There was an article about FreeHAL in the ''[[Linux Magazine]]'', Issue 97 from December 2008. In the German magazine ''com!'', the program was on the CD/DVD and in the list of the Top-10-Open-Source programs of the month.

'''Oktōēchos''' (here transcribed "Octoechos"; [[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|ὁ Ὀκτώηχος}} pronounced in [[Koine Greek|koine]]: {{IPA-grc|okˈtóixos}};&lt;ref&gt;The female form ''{{lang|grc|ἡ Ὀκτώηχος}}'' exists as well, but means the book [[Octoechos (liturgy)|octoechos]].&lt;/ref&gt; from [[wikt:ὀκτώ|ὀκτώ]] "eight" and [[wikt:ἦχος|ἦχος]] "sound, mode" called [[echos]]; [[Church Slavonic|Slavonic]]: Осмогласие, ''Osmoglasie'' from [[wikt:осмь|о́смь]] "eight" and [[wikt:гласъ|гласъ]] "voice, sound") is the name of the eight [[musical mode|mode]] system used for the composition of religious chant in Byzantine, Syriac, Armenian, Georgian, Latin and Slavic churches since the Middle Ages. In a modified form the octoechos is still regarded as the foundation of the tradition of monodic Orthodox chant today ([[Neobyzantine Octoechos]]).

The [[Octoechos (liturgy)|Octoechos]] as a liturgical concept which established an organization of the calendar into eight-week cycles, was the invention of monastic hymnographers at [[Mar Saba]] in Palestine and in Constantinople. It was formally accepted in the [[Quinisext Council]] of 692 {{cn |date= June 2017}}, which also aimed to replace the exegetic poetry of the [[kontakion]] and other homiletic poetry, as it was sung during the morning service ([[Matins#Eastern Christianity|Orthros]]) of the cathedrals.

One reason why another eight mode system was established by Frankish reformers during the [[Charlemagne and church music|Carolingian reform]], may well have been that [[Pope Adrian I]] accepted the seventh-century Eastern reform for the Western Church as well during the [[Second Council of Nicaea|787 synod]]. The only evidence for this is an abbreviated chant book called a "[[tonary]]". It was a list of incipits of chants ordered according to the intonation formula of each church tone and its [[psalmody]]. Later on, fully notated and theoretical tonaries were also written.

The Byzantine book [[Octoechos (liturgy)|Octoechos]] has originally been part of the [[sticherarion]]. It was one of the first hymn books with musical notation and its earliest copies survived from the 10th century. Its redaction follows the [[Stoudios|Studites]] reform, during which the sticherarion has been invented.

==Origins==

Students of Orthodox chant today often memorize the history of Byzantine chant in three periods, identified by the names [[John of Damascus]] (675/676-749) as the "beginning", [[John Koukouzeles]] (c. 1280-1360) as the "flower" ([[Papadic Octoechos]]), and [[Chrysanthos of Madytos]] (c. 1770-c. 1840) as the master of the living tradition today ([[Neobyzantine Octoechos]]). The latter has the reputation, that he once connected in his time the current tradition with the past of [[Byzantine chant]], which was in fact the work of at least four generations of teachers at the New Music School of the Patriarchate.

This division of the history into three periods begins quite late with the 8th century, despite the fact that the octoechos reform had been already accepted some decades ago, before John and [[Cosmas of Maiuma|Cosmas]] entered the monastery [[Mar Saba]] in Palestine. The earliest sources which gave evidence of the octoechos' use in Byzantine chant, can be dated back to the 6th century.&lt;ref&gt;Papyrus studies proved, that there were already ''tropologia'' or ''tropariologia'', as the earliest books of the hymn reform had been called, since the 6th century, soon after the Constantinopolitan school of [[Romanos the Melodist]], and not only in Jerusalem, but also in Alexandria and Constantinople ([[#Tro07|Troelsgård 2007]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jerusalem, Alexandria, or Constantinople===

The common schedule and the focus on the circle around [[John of Damascus]] is confirmed by a ninth-century treatise called "Hagiopolites" (from ''hagios polis'', "Holy City", referring to Jerusalem) which only survived in a complete form as a late copy.&lt;ref&gt;The manuscript ([[Bibliothèque nationale de France|F-Pn]] fonds grec, [[#F-PnGr360|ms. 360]]) was edited by Jørgen Raasted ([[#Raa83|1983]]) who dated the manuscript back to the 14th century. In fact the compilation has parts compiled in one manuscript which can be dated back to the period between the 12th and 15th centuries, the Hagiopolites part rather seems to be an earlier one. Another fragment also dates back to the 12th century and was edited by Johann Friedrich Bellermann ([[#Bel72|1972]]).&lt;/ref&gt; The Hagiopolites treatise served presumably as an introduction of a book called ''tropologion'' – a 9th-century chant book which had been replaced soon by the book [[Octoechos (liturgy)|octoechos]], as part of the [[sticherarion]] one of the first chant books fully provided with musical notation. The Hagiopolitan emphasis on John of Damascus was obviously the late result of a 9th-century redaction around the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] in 787, so it was part of the later [[Stoudios|Studites]] reform between Jerusalem and Constantinople and it was motivated theologically, not only because of his contributions to the tropologion, but also because of the keyrole which John of Damascus' polemic against the iconoclasts had during this Council.&lt;ref&gt;[[John of Damascus|John]]'s 3 "Apologetic treatises against those decrying the holy icons" (Λόγοι ἀπολογητικοὶ πρὸς τοὺς διαβάλλοντας τὰς ἀγίας εἰκόνας) had been once used during [[Council of Hieria|an earlier council]] to condemn the author posthumously as a heretic in 754, while the following council did not only declare the former one with all its decisions as illegal. It relied on the same treatises in order to solve the crisis of [[iconoclasm]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the theological and liturgical concept of an eight-week cycle can be traced back to the cathedral rite of Jerusalem during the 5th century, and originally it was the Christian justification of Sunday as the eighth day after Sabbat.&lt;ref&gt;Frøyshov ([[#Fro07|2007, pp. 144-153]]).&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Jeffery assumed a first phase during which the concept existed independently in various places, and a second phase during which Palestine became the leading centre of a monastic hymn reform. It established reform models which were also used later by the generation of John of Damascus.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Jeffery ([[#Jef01|2001]]).&lt;/ref&gt; Despite that the first paragraph of the "Hagiopolites" ascribes the treatise to John of Damascus, it was probably written about 100 years after his death and went through several redactions during the following centuries.

There is no doubt that the octoechos reform itself had already taken place by 692, because certain passages of the ''Hagiopolites'' paraphrase certain law texts (the [[Quinisext Council|canons of the synodal decree]]).&lt;ref&gt;Jørgen Raasted ([[#Raa83|1983, §8, p. 16]]) already pointed at certain expressions. Peter Jeffery ([[#Jef01|2001, pp. 186f]]) believes that certain paraphrases are polemics against certain modes which had been part of the 16 echoi of the Asma, the modal system of the Constantinopolitan cathedral rite as it was mentioned briefly (see [[#Phthorai and mesoi of the Hagia Sophia|below]]).&lt;/ref&gt; Eric Werner assumed that the eight-mode system developed in Jerusalem since the late fifth century and that the reform by the hymnographers of Mar Saba were already a synthesis with the Ancient Greek names used for the tropes, applied to a model of Syrian origin already used in the Byzantine tradition of Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;Harold S. {{Harvnb|Powers}}, "Mode, §II: Medieval Modal Theory, 1: The Elements, (ii) The Byzantine Model: Oktōēchos", see also Jeffery ([[#Jef01|2001]]) and Werner ([[#Wer48|1948]]).&lt;/ref&gt; {{anchor|Al-Kindi}}During the eighth century, long before Ancient Greek treatises were translated into Arabic and Persian dialects between the ninth and the tenth centuries, there was already a great interest among theorists like [[Al-Kindi|Abū Yūsuf al-Kindī]], whose Arabic terms were obviously translated from the Greek.&lt;ref&gt;Eckhard Neubauer ([[#Neu98|1998]]).&lt;/ref&gt; He adored the universality of the Greek octoechos:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sämtliche Stile aller Völker aber haben Teil an den acht byzantinischen Modi (''hiya min al-alhān at-tamāniya ar-rūmīya''), die wir erwähnt haben, denn es gibt nichts unter allem, was man hören kann, das nicht zu einem von ihnen gehörte, sei es die Stimme eines Menschen oder eines anderen Lebewesens, wie das Wiehern eines Pferdes oder das Schreien eines Esels oder das Krähen des Hahns. Alles, was an Formen des Schreis einem jeden Lebewesen/Tier eigen ist, ist danach bekannt, zu welchem Modus der acht es gehört, und es ist nicht möglich, daß es sich außerhalb eines von ihnen [bewegt].&lt;ref&gt;German translation by Eckhard Neubauer ([[#Neu98|1998, pp. 378f]]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Every style of any tribe takes part of the Byzantine eight tones (''hiya min al-alhān at-tamāniya ar-rūmīya'') which I mentioned here. Everything which can be heard, be it the human or be it the animal voice – like the neighing of a horse, the braying of a donkey, or the carking of a cock, can be classified according to one of the eight modes, and it is impossible to find anything outside of the eight mode system.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Al-Kindi demonstrated the intervals on the keyboard of a simple four-stringed [[oud]], starting from the third string as well seven steps in ascending as in descending direction.

According to [[Eckhard Neubauer]], there is another Persian system of seven ''advār'' ("cycles"), outside the Arabic reception of the Byzantine octoechos, which was possibly a cultural transfer from [[Sanskrit]] treatises. Persian and Ancient Greek sources had been the main reference for the transfer of knowledge in Arabian-Islamic science.

===Monastic reform of Mar Saba===
According to the ''Hagiopolites'' the eight ''[[echos|echoi]]'' ("[[Mode (music)|modes]]") were divided in four "kyrioi" (authentic) ''echoi'' and their four respective ''[[Plagal mode|plagioi]]'' (enriched, developed) ''echoi'', which were all in the [[diatonic genus]].

==== 8 diatonic echoi of the Hagiopolitan Octoechos ====
Despite the late copies of the Greek ''Hagiopolites'' treatise, the earliest Latin description of the Greek system of eight ''echoi'' is an eleventh-century treatise compilation called "alia musica". "Echos" was translated as "sonus" by the anonymous compilator, who commented with a comparison of the Byzantine octoechos:&lt;ref&gt;According to Charles Atkinson ([[#Atk08|2008]]: p.177) the commentary was inserted by "author δ", the compilator of the fourth layer.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Quorum videlicet troporum, sive etiam sonorum, primus graeca lingua dicitur Protus; secundus Deuterus; tertius Tritus; quartus Tetrardus: qui singuli a suis finalibus deorsum pentachordo, quod est diapente, differunt. Superius vero tetrachordum, quod est diatessaron, requirunt, ut unusquisque suam speciem diapason teneat, per quam evagando, sursum ac deorsum libere currat. Cui scilicet diapason plerumque exterius additur, qui emmelis, id est, aptus melo vocatur.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sciendum quoque, quod Dorius maxime proto regitur, similiter Phrygius deutero, Lydius trito, mixolydius tetrardo. Quos sonos in quibusdam cantilenis suae plagae quodammodo tangendo libant, ut plaga proti tangat protum, deuteri deuterum, triti tritum, tetrardi tetrardum. Et id fas est experiri in gradalibus antiphonis.&lt;ref&gt;Gerbert ([[#aliamusica|1784]], 139).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is known about the tropes, as to say: the ἦχοι, that the Greek language call the First πρῶτος, the Second δεύτερος, the Third τρίτος, the Fourth τέταρτος. Their Finales were separated by a pentachord, that is: a falling fifth (gr. ''diapente'') [between ''kyrios'' and ''plagios'']. And above [the pentachord] they require a tetrachord, that is: a fourth (gr. ''diatessaron''), so that each of them has its octave species, in which it can move freely, rambling down and up. For the full octave (gr. ''diapason'') another tone might be added, which is called ὁ ἐμμελής: "according to the melos".&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;It has to be known that the "Dorian" &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[octave species]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; is usually ruling in the πρῶτος, as the "Phrygian" in the δεύτερος, the "Lydian" in the τρίτος, or the "Mixolydian" in the τέταρτος. Their πλάγιοι are derived by these ἦχοι in that way, that the formula touch them [going down a fifth]. So the πλάγιος τοῦ πρώτου touch the πρῶτος, the plagal Second [τοῦ δευτέρου] the δεύτερος, the plagal Third [βαρύς] the τρίτος, the plagal Fourth [πλάγιος τοῦ τετάρτου] the τέταρτος. And this should be proved by the melodies of the antiphonal graduals as a divine law.&lt;ref&gt;Translation by Oliver Gerlach ([[#Ger12|2012]], 177).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This Latin description about the octoechos used by Greek singers (''psaltes'') is very precise, when it says that each ''kyrios'' and ''plagios'' pair used the same octave, divided into a fifth ([[pentachord]]) and a fourth ([[tetrachord]]): D—a—d in protos, E—b—e in devteros, F—c—f in tritos, and C—G—c in tetartos.&lt;ref&gt;The octave can be transposed, but if the tetartos octave for example is G-g, it has f sharp.&lt;/ref&gt; While the ''kyrioi'' had the finalis (final, and usually also base note) on the top, the ''plagioi'' had the finalis on bottom of the pentachord.

The intonation formulas, called ''[[enechema]]'' (gr. ἐνήχημα), for the [[authentic modes]] or ''kyrioi echoi'', usually descend within the pentachord and turn back to the finalis at the end, while the [[plagal modes]] or ''plagioi echoi'' just move to the upper third. The later dialogue treatises (Gr. ἐρωταποκρίσεις, ''erotapokriseis'') refer to the Hagiopolitan diatonic eight modes, when they use the ''kyrioi'' intonations to find those of the ''plagioi'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Περὶ πλαγίων

==== Phthorai and mesoi of the Hagia Sophia ====
The Hagiopolites as "earliest" theoretical treatise said, that two additional [[phthora (music)|phthorai]] ("destroyers") were like proper modes which did not fit into the diatonic octoechos system, so the Hagiopolitan octoechos was in fact a system of 10 modes. But the chronology of definitions concerned about two phthorai regarded them first as modes of their own because of their proper melos and that their models had to be sung during the eight-week cycle. These mesoi of tetartos and protos, with a finalis and base between kyrios and plagios, were obviously favoured by composer like John of Damascus and his step-brother Kosmas, while the concept of a transition between echoi was established later. It seems that the construction of the eight diatonic echoi was established later by the generation of [[Theodore the Studite]] and his brother Joseph.

The later Papadikai mentions that changes between the echos tritos and the echos plagios tetartos were bridged by the enharmonic phthora [[Nana (echos)|nana]], and changes between the echos protos and the echos plagios devteros by the chromatic phthora [[nenano]].

Nevertheless, the terminology of the Hagiopolites somehow suggested that nenano and nana as phthorai "destroy" one or two [[diatonic]] degrees used within one tetarchord of a certain echos, so that the chromatic and enharmonic genera were somehow subordinated and excluded from the diatonic octoechos. This raises the question, when the music in the near eastern Middle Ages became entirely diatonic, since certain melodies were coloured by the other enharmonic and chromatic gene according to the school of Damascus. This is the question about the difference between the Hagiopolitan reform of 692 and in as much it was opposed to the Constantinopolitan tradition and its own modal system.

The author of the Hagiopolites mentioned an alternative system of 16 echoi "sung in the Asma," with 4 phthorai and 4 mesoi beyond the kyrioi and plagioi of the diatonic Octoechos:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Οἱ μὲν οὖν τέσσαρρεις πρῶτοι οὐκ ἐξ ἄλλων τινων ἀλλ'ἐξ αὐτῶν γινονται. οἱ δὲ τέσσαρεις δεύτεροι, ἤγουν οἱ πλάγιοι, ὁ μὲν πλάγιος πρῶτος ἐκ τῆς ὑπορροῆς τοῦ πρώτου γέγονε. καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς ὑπορροῆς τοῦ πληρώματος τοῦ δευτέρου γέγονεν ὁ πλάγιος δευτέρου· ὡς ἐπὶ τὸ πλεῖστον δὲ καὶ τὰ πληρώματα τοῦ δευτέρου [εἰς τὸν πλάγιον δευτέρου] τελειοῖ. ὁ βαρὺς ὁμοίως καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ τρίτοῦ· καὶ γὰρ εἰς τὸ ἆσμα ἡ ὑποβολὴ τοῦ βαρέως τρίτος ψάλλεται ἅμα τοῦ τέλους αὐτοῦ. καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ τετάρτου γέγονεν ὁ πλάγιος τέταρτος. καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν τεσσάρων πλαγίων ἐγεννήθησαν τέσσαρεις μέσοι· καὶ ἀπ'αὐτῶν αἱ τέσσαρες φθοραί. καί ἀνεβιβάσθησαν ἦχοι ις', οἵτινες ψάλλονται εἰς τὸ ἆσμα, οἱ δὲ δέκα ὡς προείπομεν εἰς τὸν Ἁγιοπολίτην.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The 4 Echoi which come first are generated from themselves, not from others. As to the four which come next, i.e. the Plagal ones, Plagios Prōtos is derived from Prōtos, and Plagios Deuteros from Deuteros – normally Deuteros melodies end in Plagios Deuteros. Similarly, Barys from Tritos – "for in the Asma Hypobole of Barys is sung as Tritos together with its ending". From the 4 Plagioi originate the 4 Mesoi, and from these the 4 Phthorai. This makes up the 16 Echoi which are sung in the Asma – as already mentioned, there are sung only 10 in the Hagiopolites.&lt;ref&gt;Raasted ([[#Raa83|1983, §6, p.14]]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These "echoi of the Asma" did probably point at the rite at the Patriarchal church or even at the cathedral rite of Constantinople which was also known as "choral" or "sung rite" (ἀκολουθία ᾀσματική). The Constantinopolitan chant books were called ''[[asmatikon]]'' ("book of the choir"), ''[[psaltikon]]'' ("book of the soloist called 'monophonaris'"), and ''[[Kontakion|kontakarion]]'' (the name of the psaltikon, if it included the huge collection of kontakia, sung during the morning service).

Unfortunately no early Constantinopolitan chant manual survived, there is only this short paragraph of the Hagiopolites which says, that the singers of the choir followed in their chant books an own modal system, which was distinct from the Hagiopolitan octoechos. A distinction from Constantinople is not the only possible explanation, because Jerusalem had also its own local cathedral rite. Since the 14th century at latest, the monastic rite was not opposed to the cathedral rite, even monks celebrated it on festival occasions, whenever they expected guests.

The earliest sources are those of the Slavic reception of Constantinople which can be dated back not earlier than to the 12th century, and they used a system of 12 modes.&lt;ref&gt;Constantine Floros' comparative studies which had been recently republished in English translation by Neil Moran ([[#Flo09|Floros 2009]]), compared the oldest chant books of the Asma, notated in Byzantine round notation during the 12th and 13th century, with the Slavic Kontakaria and the older Kontakarion notation which has only survived in a 14th-century manuscript (Kastoria, Cathedral Library, Ms. 8). The notator of Kastoria 8 already translated this notation into round notation, the notation system of the Stoudites reform since the 10th century. The cathedral rite of Constantinople was abandoned in 1204, when the Patriarchate and the Court went into the exile at Nicaea. After their return in 1261, the tradition was not continued, but replaced by a mixed rite. In the new chant books parts of the older tradition had been already transcribed into round notation.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest treatises which mention a modal system, is not a chant manual, but a corpus of alchemic treatises, which testifies a modal system of 24 "elements" (στοιχεῖα) or "aims" (στοχοὶ):

&lt;blockquote&gt;Ὥσπερ δὲ τεσσάρων ὄντων μουσικῶν γενικωτάτων στοχῶν, Α Β Γ Δ, γίνονται παρ῾ αὐτῶν τῷ εἴδει διάφοροι στοχοὶ κδ´, κέντροι καὶ ἶσοι καὶ πλάγιοι, καθαροί τε καὶ ἄηχοι &lt;καὶ παράηχοι&gt; · καὶ ἀδύνατον ἄλλως ὑφανθῆναι τὰς κατὰ μέρος ἀπείρους μελῳδίας τῶν ὕμνων ἣ θεραπειῶν, ἤ ἄποκαλύψεων, ἤ ἄλλου σκέλους τῆς ἱερᾶς ἐπιστήμης, καὶ οἷον ῥεύσεως ἤ φθορᾶς ἤ ἄλλων μουσικῶν παθῶν ἐλευθέρας,&lt;ref&gt;Alchemy treatise ascribed to [[Zosimos of Panopolis|Zosimos of Alexandria]] (Pseudo-Zosimos), quoted according to Berthelot ([[#Ber1888|1888]], iii:434; see also the alternative version: [https://archive.org/stream/collectiondesan00bertgoog#page/n125/mode/2up ii:219]). Otto Gombosi ([[#GomAl|1940]], p. 40) changed the original text by replacing στόχος ("aim, target") with στοχείον ("element"). He referred that the earliest layer might be dated back to the 3rd and 4th century (obviously Carsten Høeg's datation), while the text compilation which had survived in several Alchemy collections, was presumably made during the 7th century. Lukas Richter ([[#ZosNG|NGrove]]) dated the music treatise of this compilation later to the 8th and 9th century.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;As there are 4 basic elements/targets &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Classical element|earth, water, air, and fire]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; which created their music, the πρῶτος, the δεύτερος, the τρίτος, and the τέταρτος, and by their formulas the same generate 24 different elements: the &lt;nowiki&gt;[4]&lt;/nowiki&gt; κέντροι (central), &lt;nowiki&gt;[4]&lt;/nowiki&gt; ἶσοι (basic), and &lt;nowiki&gt;[4]&lt;/nowiki&gt; πλάγιοι (plagal), the &lt;nowiki&gt;[4]&lt;/nowiki&gt; καθαροί (kathartic), &lt;nowiki&gt;[4]&lt;/nowiki&gt; ἄηχοι (aphonic), and &lt;nowiki&gt;[4]&lt;/nowiki&gt; παράηχοι (paraphonic). Hence, it is impossible to create something outside those infinite melodies of hymns, treatments, revelations, and of other parts of the Holy Wisdom, which is free from the irregularities and corruptions of other musical emotions (πάθη).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the edition of the treatise by Otto Gombosi, the four "elements" (α', β', γ', δ') were associated with certain colours—πρῶτος with black (all colours together), δεύτερος with white (no colour at all), τρίτος with yellow (an elementary coulour), and τέταρτος with purple (a combination of elementary colours). These passages could be easily compiled with [[Zosimos of Panopolis]]' treatise about the process of bleaching.

The system favoured 3 four tetrachord sets (either modes by themselves or simply degree of the modes with different functions), called κέντροι, ἷσοι, and πλάγιοι. Kέντρος would be probably an early name for μέσος, if it lied between the ἶσος and πλάγιος, it could be as well used as an early name for κύριος ἦχος, because it is mentioned here first, while ἶσος could mean "equivalent", or just basis notes.

The exact point of reference concerning this 24 mode system was not clarified in the treatise, but it is evident, that there was a canonised wisdom which was connected with an ethical doctrine excluding certain passions (πάθη, ''pathe'') as corruptions. Inside this wisdom, there was a Neoplatonic concept of an ideal and divine existence, which can be found and classified according to a modal scheme based on four elements. The term "element" (στοχείον) was less meant as a technical term or modal category, it was rather an alchemistic interpretation of the 24 musical modes.

In comparison, the Hagiopolitan terminology already included the "corruption" (φθορά) as an acceptable modal category in itself, which was neither excluded in the Hagiopolitan Octoechos nor in the modal system of a certain cathedral rite, which was made of 16 echoi. On the other hand, the described system, whether it meant 24 echoi including 12 pathologic echoi, called "aechoi" and "paraechoi", and associated with 4 "katharoi" or just cadential degrees or other modal functions. It is not clear, whether the latter name was simply meant in a geographical or ethnical way or whether it was here connected with a kind of music therapy which included certain ''pathe'' as a kind of antidote. Medical treatises of the Mediterranean had been developed later on by the association of melodic modes with 4 elements and 4 humours.&lt;ref&gt;About the reception in Arabic and Persian medical treatises concerning music therapy, see Gerhard Neubauer ([[#Neu90|1990]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Latin reception ==

[[File:Tonary fragment of Saint-Riquier.jpg|thumb|400px|The earliest [[tonary]]: the fragment of Saint-Riquier ([[Bibliothèque Nationale de France|F-Pn]] lat. Ms. [[#Riquier|13159, fol. 167r]])]]

The introduction of the eight mode system in Western chant traditions was part of the Carolingian reform. Officially, it was motivated by [[Pope Adrian I]]'s confirmation of an earlier Eastern chant reform during the synode in 787, during which he accepted the reform for the Western traditions as well. Nevertheless, a Carolingian interest for the Byzantine octoechos can already be dated back to a visit some years earlier, when a Byzantine legacy introduced a series of antiphons sung during a procession for Epiphany. These antiphons served as a model for the eight modes according to the Hagiopolitan system.

The contemporary invention of a proper Latin version of the eight mode system was mainly studied from two perspectives:

* the reception of Ancient Greek music theory since [[Boethius]] and the synthesis between music theory as a science and a liberal art of the mathematic ''Quadrivium'' on the one hand, and as a medium of chant transmission on the other hand. The eight church tones were called after the names of octave species, which were not connected with modal patterns and plainchant theory in earlier times.
* the simplification of chant transmission by a Western manuscript type called [[tonary]] which allowed the transfer of a huge chant repertoire like the Roman one, but also its deductive modal classification which changed the oral transmission of chant entirely.

=== Synthesis in Latin music theory ===

Latin theorists who knew the Hellenic tropes only through [[Boethius]]' 6th-century translation of [[Ptolemy]] (''De institutione musica''), made the synthesis of the Ancient Greek music theory with the Octoechos as a system of eight church tones, identified with the ''tropes''. The synthesis had not been done earlier than during the Carolingian reform (usually dated according to [[Charlemagne]]'s ''[[admonitio generalis]]'' which was decreed in 789), before music theory as science was strictly separated from chant transmission and the cantor as a profession dedicated to church music.

The terms ''tropus'' (transposition octave) and ''modus'' (the [[Octave species|octave genre]] defined by the position of the ''tonus'', the whole tone with the proportion of 9:8, and the ''semitonium'', the half tone with the proportion of 256:243) were taken from Boethius' translation.&lt;ref&gt;Book 4, chapter 15 of Boethius' ''De institutione musica'', see Bower's translation in Harold Powers' article "mode" ({{Harvnb|Powers}}, II:1:i, section "The Hellenistic model: tonus, modus, tropus").&lt;/ref&gt; But the Antique names of the seven ''[[Mode (music)#Greek|modi]]'' were applied to the eight church tones called ''[[Mode (music)#Tonoi|toni]]''. The first attempt to connect Ancient Greek music theory (as expressed in  Boethius) and the theory of plainchant can be found in the treatise ''De harmonica institutione'' by [[Hucbald]] of [[Saint-Amand Abbey]], written by the end of the 9th century, in which the author addressed his treatise explicitly to cantors and not to mathematicians,&lt;ref&gt;Charles Atkinson ([[#Atk08|2008]], pp. 149f).&lt;/ref&gt; whereas the reduction of 4 "finales" which made up the tetrachord D—E—F—G, was already done in Carolingian times in the treatises ''Musica'' and ''Scolica enchiriadis''. ''Musica enchiriadis'' is also the only Latin treatise which testifies to the presence of a tetraphonic tone system, represented by 4 ''Dasia''-signs and therefore called "[[Daseian notation|Dasia system]]", and even the practical use of transposition (''metabolē kata tonon'') in plainchant, called "absonia". Its name probably derived from "sonus", the Latin term for ἦχος, but in the context of this treatise the use of ''absonia'' is reserved to describe a primitive form of polyphony or heterophony, rather than serving as a precise description of transposition in monodic chant, as it was used in certain genres of Byzantine chant.

Hucbald used an idiosyncratic Greek letter system which referred to the double octave system (''[[Tone system#Syst.C3.AAma Ametabolon.2C an overview of the tone system|systēma teleion]]'') and called the four elements known as "finales" according to the Greek system:&lt;ref&gt;See Atkinson ([[#Atk08|2008]]: ex.4.5, p.157) or ex. 2 in Harold Powers' article "mode" ({{Harvnb|Powers}}, II:2:i:a "The System of Tetrachords"). The different letter systems used in the notation of theoretical and liturgical chant sources are described by Nancy Phillips ([[#Phi00|2000]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Λιχανὸς ὑπάτων ['''D'''] is &lt;nowiki&gt;[the φθόγγος of]&lt;/nowiki&gt; the autentus protus and its plagal which are &lt;nowiki&gt;[tonus]&lt;/nowiki&gt; I and II, ὑπάτη μέσων ['''E'''] of the autentus deuterus and its plagal which are &lt;nowiki&gt;[tonus]&lt;/nowiki&gt; III and IV, παρυπάτῃ μέσων ['''F'''] of the autentus tritus and its plagal which are &lt;nowiki&gt;[tonus]&lt;/nowiki&gt; V and VI, λιχανὸς μέσων ['''G'''] of the autentus tetrardus and its plagal which are &lt;nowiki&gt;[tonus]&lt;/nowiki&gt; VII and VIII, for the reason, that these four very present ones surround necessarily each melody, so that they, however they might be, can be reduced to them. These four &lt;nowiki&gt;[φθόγγοι]&lt;/nowiki&gt; are called 'finales', since in all those &lt;nowiki&gt;[melodies]&lt;/nowiki&gt; which are sung, they are perceived as their end.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the Latin synthesis the [[Plagal mode|plagal]] and [[authentic tones]] of ''protus, deuterus, tritus'', and ''tetrardus'' did not use the same [[Ambitus (music)|ambitus]] as in the Hagiopolitan Octoechos, but authentic and plagal tones used both the ''finalis'' of the ''plagios'', so that the ''finalis'' of the ''kyrios'', the fifth degree of the mode, was no longer used as ''finalis'', but as "repercussa": the recitation tone used in a simple form of [[psalmody]] which was another genuine invention by the Carolingian reformers. The ambitus of the authentic tones was made up the same way as used in the Greek Octoechos, while the plagal tones used a lower ambitus: not the tetrachord above the pentachord, but below it. Hence, the hypodorian octave referred the "tonus secundus" and was constructed A—'''D'''—a, and the dorian as "tonus primus" '''D'''—a—d, both tones of the protus used D as ''finalis'', the hypophrygian octave was B—'''E'''—b and was the ambitus of the "tonus quartus", and the phrygian octave '''E'''—b—e was related to the "tonus tertius" and its ''finalis'' E belonged to the deuterus, the hypolydian octave C—'''F'''—c was connected with the "tonus sixtus", the lydian octave '''F'''—c—f with the "tonus quintus" and both shared the ''finalis'' F called "tritus", the last was the seventh octave '''G'''—d—g called "mixolydian" which referred to the "tonus septimus" and its ''finalis'' G.

=== Tonary ===

[[File:TonarAdemar.jpg|thumb|400px|The intonation formulas for the 8 tones according to the Aquitanian [[tonary]] of [[Adémar de Chabannes]] ([[Bibliothèque Nationale de France|F-Pn]] lat. Ms. [[#Pbn909|909, fol. 151r-154r]])]]

The earliest chant theory connected with the Carolingian octoechos was related to the book [[tonary]]. It played a key role in memorising chant and the earliest tonaries referred to the Greek names as elements of a tetrachord: πρῶτος, δεύτερος, τρίτος, and τέταρτος. They were translated into Latin as "protus", "deuterus", "tritus", and "tetrardus", but only the tetrachord D—E—F—G was supposed to contain the final notes ("finales") for the eight tones used in the Latin octoechos. Since the 10th century the eight tones were applied to eight simplified models of psalmody, which soon adopted in their terminations the melodic beginnings of the antiphons, which were sung as refrains during psalm recitation. This practice made the transitions smoother, and in the list of the antiphons which can be found since the earliest tonaries, it was enough to refer to the melodic beginnings or incipits of the text. In the earliest tonaries no models of psalmody had been given and incipits from all chant genres were listed, probably just for a modal classification (see the section for the "Autentus protus" of the Saint Riquier tonary).

According to Michel Huglo, there was a prototype tonary which initiated the Carolingian reform.&lt;ref&gt;Huglo ([[#Hug71|1971]]).&lt;/ref&gt; But in a later study he mentioned an even earlier tonary which was brought as a present by a Byzantine legacy which celebrated procession antiphons for [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] in a Latin translation.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Huglo ([[#Hug00|2000]]) refers to an episode which was described long ago by Oliver Strunk ([[#Str60|1960]]) in connection with the inaugurated  [[Palatine Chapel in Aachen|Palatine Chapel]], but dated it earlier. According to later interpretations the later Latin compositions had been made according to the Carolingian tonary, but inspired by the Greek troparia.&lt;/ref&gt;

Already during the 10th century tonaries became so widespread in different regions, that they do not only allow to study the difference between local schools according to its modal classification, its redaction of modal patterns, and its own way of using Carolingian psalmody. They also showed a fundamental difference between the written transmission of Latin and Greek chant traditions, as it had developed between the 10th and 12th centuries. The main concern of Latin cantors and their tonaries was a precise and unambiguous classification of whatever melody type according to the local perception of the Octoechos system.

Greek psaltes were not interested at all in this question. They knew the models of each modes by certain simple chant genres as the ''[[troparion]]'' and the ''[[heirmos|heirmoi]]'' (the melodic models used to create poetry in the meter of the heirmologic odes), but other genres like ''[[sticheron]]'' and ''[[kontakion]]'' could change the echos within their melos, so their main interest was the relationship between the echoi to compose elegant and discrete changes between them.

In contrary, the very particular form and function of the tonary within chant transmission made it evident, that the modal classification of Latin cantors according to the eight tones of the Octoechos had to be done a posteriori, deduced by the modal analysis of the chant and its melodic patterns, while the transmission of the traditional chant itself did not provide any model except of the psalm tones used for the recitation of the psalms and the [[canticle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Jeffery's important and long essay about "The Earliest Oktōēchoi" ([[#Jef01|2001]]) emphasized an analytic modal classification a posteriori as an essential observation concerning the Western use of the octoechos.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tonary was the very heart of the mainly oral chant transmission used during the Carolingian reform and as its medium it must have had a strong impact on the melodic memory of the cantors who used it in order to memorize the Roman chant, after a synode confirmed Charlemagne's [[Admonitio Generalis|''admonitio generalis'']]. The written transmission by fully notated chant manuscripts, the object of chant studies today, cannot be dated back to an earlier time than nearly 200 years after the ''admonitio''—the last third of the 10th century. And it seems that Roman cantors whose tradition had to be learnt, followed at least 100 years later by the transcription of their chant repertory and no document has survived which can testify the use of tonaries among Roman cantors. [[Pope Adrian I]]'s confirmation of the Eastern octoechos reform had probably no consequences on the tradition of Roman chant, which might be an explanation for the distinct written transmission, as it can be studied between [[Gregorian Chant|Roman Frankish]] and [[Old Roman chant]] manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;The debate of chant transmission in comparison between Old Roman and Gregorian manuscripts started in the time of [[Bruno Stäblein]] and Helmut Hucke, and was continued during the 1990s between Peter Jeffery, James McKinnon, Leo Treitler, Theodore Karp, James Grier, Kenneth Levy, and others. The dissertation of Andreas Pfisterer ([[#Pfi02|2002]]) offers not only an important overview over this debate of a "Gregorian" historiography, but also a useful discussion of the transformation of chant between the various books of written transmission: the [[sacramentaries]] with more or less modal classifications, added neume passages until the fully notated chant manuscripts as the so-called [[Roman Gradual]] for Mass chant, and the [[Antiphonary]] for Office chant—sources, which he has all listed in his bibliography. Today the discussion has been refined by the distinction of various local chant traditions, which had been modified during various periods of liturgical reforms and their transformations of chant transmission. This diachronic study bridges the history of Western chant traditions with church and political history.&lt;/ref&gt;

The eight sections of the Latin tonary are usually ordered "Tonus primus Autentus Protus", "Tonus secundus Plagi Proti", "Tonus tertius Autentus deuterus" etc. Each section is opened by an intonation formula using the names like "Noannoeane" for the authentic and "Noeagis" for the plagal tones. In his theoretical tonary "Musica disciplina" [[Aurelian of Réôme]] asked a Greek about the meaning of the syllables, and reported that they had no meaning, they were rather an expression of joy as used by peasants to communicate with their working animals like horses.&lt;ref&gt;Aurelianus Reomensis: "Musica disciplina" ([[#Aur84|Gerbert, 1784]], 42) is quoted in the article [[Tonary#The Carolingian names or "Byzantine" intonations for the 8 tones|tonary]].&lt;/ref&gt; There was usually no exact resemblance of the Latin syllables to the names of the Greek intonations or ''enechemata'' which were identified with the diatonic kyrioi and plagioi echoi, but Aurelian's question made it obvious that the practice was taken from Greek singers. Unlike the Hagiopolitan octoechos, which used two additional ''phthorai'' with the syllables [[Nana (echos)|Nana]] and [[Nenano]] for changes into the enharmonic and chromatic genus, the enharmonic and chromatic genus was excluded from the Latin octoechos, at least according to Carolingian theorists.

Since the 10th century tonaries also include the mnemic verses of certain model antiphons which memorise each tone by one verse. The most common among all tonaries was also used by [[Guido of Arezzo]] in his treatise [[Micrologus]]: "Primum querite regnum dei", "Secundum autem simile est huic" etc. Another characteristic was that melodic melisms called ''neumae'' followed the intonation formulas or mnemic verses. Usually they differed more among different tonaries than the preceding intonations or verses, but they all demonstrated the generative and creative aspect within chant transmission.&lt;ref&gt;It was Jørgen Raasted ([[#Raa88|1988]]) who draw the first time a parallel between Byzantine kallopismoi or teretismoi and the abstract syllables in Western and Eastern intonations. The comparison was later expanded to creative forms of Latin cantors, such as meloform [[trope (music)|tropes]] and [[Organum|organa]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In comparison with Byzantine psaltes who always used notation in a more or less stenographic way, the exact patterns used during the so-called "thesis of the melos" belonged to the oral tradition of a local school, its own modal system and its genre. But already the question of chant genre was connected with local traditions in medieval times and the point of reference for the psaltes who performed a certain genre: the Hagiopolitan octoechos and its genres (the odes according to the models of the [[heirmologion]], the troparia of the [[octoechos (liturgy)|octoechos]] or tropologion), or the Constantinopolitan cathedral rite ''(akolouthia asmatike)'' and its books [[asmatikon]], [[psaltikon]], and [[Kontakion|kontakarion]] might serve here as examples.

==Question of intervals and their transposition==

The exact proportions which divided a [[tetrachord]], had never been a subject of Greek medieval treatises concerned about [[Byzantine chant]]. The separation between the mathematical science ''harmonikai'' and chant theory gave space to various speculations, even to the assumption that the same division was used as described in Latin music theory, operating with two diatonic intervals like ''tonus'' (9:8) and ''semitonium'' (256:243).&lt;ref&gt;Jørgen Raasted ([[#Raa66|1966, p. 7]]) accepted the assumption by Oliver Strunk ([[#Str42|1942, p. 192]]) without any objection. But Oliver Strunk was careful enough to write not only about the whole and the half tone, when he interpreted the description of the ''papadikai'': &lt;blockquote&gt;"The precise nature of the steps within this series remains for the present unknown; for all that we can learn from the Papadike, the step α [prôtos] to β [devteros] may be a whole tone, a half tone, or some other larger or smaller interval. … If we may assume, however, that the interval α [prôtos] to δ [tetartos] is a perfect fourth–a reasonable assumption, to say the least, for a tetrachordal system based on any other interval is virtually inconceivable–the interval δ [tetartos] to α [prôtos], as the difference between an octave and two fourths, becomes a whole tone and the remaining intervals fall readily into line."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, some treatises referred the tetrachord division into three intervals called the "great tone" (μείζων τόνος) which often corresponded to the prominent position of the whole tone (9:8), the "middle tone" (ἐλάσσων τόνος) between α and β, and the "small tone" (ἐλάχιστος τόνος) between β and γ which was usually a much larger interval than the half tone, and this division was common among most divisions by different ancient Greek theorists that were mentioned by [[Ptolemy]] in his ''Harmonics''. Before [[Chrysanthos of Madytos|Chrysanthos]]' ''Theoretika'' (the ''Eisagoge'' was simply an extract, while the ''Mega Theoretikon'' was published by his student Panagiotes Pelopides), exact proportions were never mentioned in Greek chant theory. His system of 68 commata which is based on a corrupted use of arithmetics, can be traced back to the division of 12:11 x 88:81 x 9:8 = 4:3 between α and δ.&lt;ref name=tambur&gt;Chrysanthos ([[#Chr1832|1832, Μερ. Α', Βιβ. γ', κεφ. α', §. 217-228, pp. 94-99]]) mentions the Ancient Greek systema teleion which has tetrachords divided by the intervals ''tonos'' 9:8 and ''leimma'' which has the proportion 13:27, after the ratio of one ''tonos'' was taken from it (§. 220). But "our scale of the diatonic genus" (§ 225) are two tetrachords between α and δ, and the intervals are derived from the end of the first δ (1:1), α (8:9), β (22:27), γ (3:4). The proportions refer to a string tuned to the pitch of δ (see also the figure on [https://archive.org/stream/theoretikonmegat00chry#page/28/mode/2up page 28], § 65). The arithmetic method is based on the common denominator (in this case 88 and 108: 108/96/88/81), so we have a division of 12 (δ—α) + 8 (α—β) + 7 (β—γ). In order to get a symmetric division in which 4 small tones made up the fourth, not 5 times like the Western half tone, he added one part to the middle tone, so that the fourth was divided in 28 parts instead of 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pitches and their tonal system===

Although Chrysanthos did not mention his name, the first who mentioned precisely these proportions starting from the open string of the third or middle chord of the [[oud]], was the Arab theorist [[Al-Farabi]] in his ''[[Kitab al-Musiqa al-Kabir]]'' which was written during the first half of the 10th century. His explicit references to Persian and Ancient Greek music theory were possible, because they had been recently translated into Arabic and Persian dialects in the library of [[Baghdad]]. Thanks to them Al-Farabi had also an excellent knowledge of Ancient Greek music theory. The method of demonstrating the intervals by the frets of the oud keyboard was probably taken from [[Al-Kindi]]. Here the intervals are not referred to the Byzantine ''phthongoi'', but to the name of the frets. And the fret corresponding to β was called "ring finger fret of Zalzal" ([[wuṣtā Zalzal]]), named after the famous Baghdadi oud player Zalzal.&lt;ref&gt;An overview over all proportions mentioned in Arabian music theory offers Liberty Manik ([[#Man69|1969]]). According to him, [[Al-Farabi]] was the first who explained all the frets needed for all possible transpositions for two diatonic tetrachord divisions, while the pythagorean proportion was called after the "old ring finger fret". By this name [[Al-Kindi]] is supposed to refer on the pythagorean proportions, although he did never specify a certain chord length in his music treatise, but soon there was a differentiation referred to two other ring finger frets—the "Persian", and the "Arab" one. The latter was probably associated with the school of [[Ibrahim Al-Mausili|Ibrahim]] and [[Ishaq al-Mawsili]].&lt;/ref&gt; It seems that the proportion of the Zalzal fret was a refined one in Bagdad using a large middle tone that came very close to the interval of the small tone, while the Mawsili school used 13:12 instead of 12:11. There is no indication that this division had been of Byzantine origin, so Western scholars felt seduced to ascribe the use of the division called "soft diatonic" (''diatonikos malakos'') and the chromaticism derived from it as an influence of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and to regard their view of the ''systema teleion'' also as a norm for the Byzantine tonal system.&lt;ref&gt;Eustathios Makris ([[#Mak05|2005, note 2 &amp; 3]]) mentioned Oliver Strunk's essay ([[Hagiopolitan Octoechos#Str42|1942]]) and Egon Wellesz' book ([[#Wel61|1961]]). Maria Alexandru ([[#Ale00|2000, pp. 11f]]) mentioned that the early occidental scholars under influence of Tillyard's "Handbook" ([[#Til35|1935]]) assumed a discontinuity in chant tradition after the fall of Constantinople connected with a strong oriental influence, whereas the "Greek school" (Stathis, Hatzigiakoumis, etc.) stressed the continuity and the importance of the living tradition. The conflict and the different positions have been described by Alexander Lingas ([[#Lin99|1999]]), the result was, that philologists refused Tillyard's ambitions, because he ignored the knowledge of the living tradition, and the Transcripta series of the ''Monumenta Musicae Byzantinae'' was not continued until today ([[#Tro11|Troelsgård 2011]]).&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Phanariotes]] (Phanar was the Greek district of Istanbul with the residence of the Patriarchate) who composed as well in the ''makamlar'', the teachers of the New Music School of the Patriarchate around Chrysanthos had certainly exchanges with Sephardic, Armenian, and Sufi musicians, but an intensive exchange between Byzantine, Arab and Persian musicians had already a history of more than 1000 years.&lt;ref&gt;Eckhard Neubauer ([[#Neu98|1998]]) mentioned several forms of exchanges since [[Al-Kindi]] and the Mawsili school.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike Latin treatises only a few Greek treatises of chant have survived and their authors wrote nothing about the intervals, about microtonal shifts as part of a certain melos and its echos, or about the practice of [[ison (music)|ison]] singing (''isokratema''). Nevertheless, these practices remained undisputed, because they are still part of the living tradition today, while Western plainchant became rediscovered during the 19th century. Neither musicians nor musicologists were longer familiar with them which explains why various descriptions, as they can be found in certain Latin treatises, were ignored for quite a long time.

Ancient Greek music theory had always been a point of reference in Latin chant treatises, something similar cannot be found in Greek chant treatises before the 14th century, but there were a few Latin treatises of the 11th century which did not only refer to Ancient music theory and the ''[[Tone system#Syst.C3.AAma Ametabolon.2C an overview of the tone system|systema teleion]]'' together with the Greek names of its elements, they even had parts dedicated to Byzantine chant.&lt;ref&gt;The [[#LugTo|tonary of Lyon]] and the compilation ''[[#Cha65|alia musica]]'' with its tonaries are describing the pitches of contemporary chant by using the Ancient Greek names.&lt;/ref&gt; The appreciation for Byzantine chant is surprising, because there were very few authors except [[Boethius]] who had really studied Greek treatises and who were also capable to translate them.

The ''systema teleion'' was present by the Boethian diagram which represented it for the diatonic, the chromatic, and the enharmonic genus. Several tonaries used letters which referred to the positions of this diagram.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Phillips' study ([[#Phi00|2000]]) offers an overview over the sources and their use of letters as a pitch notation.&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous example is the letter notation of [[William of Volpiano]] which he developed for the [[Cluniac reforms]] by the end of the 10th century. In his school a [[Antiphonary of St. Benigne|unique tonary]] was already written, when he was reforming abbot of St. [[Benignus of Dijon]]. The tonary shows the Roman-Frankish mass chant written out in neume and pitch notation. The repertory is classified according to the Carolingian tonary and its entirely diatonic octoechos. The use of tyronic letters clearly shows, that the enharmonic diesis was used as a kind of melodic attraction within the diatonic genus, which sharpened the semitonium. Even in [[Guido of Arezzo]]'s treatise ''[[Micrologus]]'', at least in earlier copies, there is still a passage which explains, how the diesis can be found on the monochord. It sharpens the semitonium by replacing the usual whole tone (9:8) between re—mi (D—E, G—a, or a—b) by an even larger one in the proportion of 7:6 which was usually perceived as an attraction towards fa.&lt;ref&gt;See Guido of Arezzo's ''Micrologus'' in the edition by Martin Gerbert ([[#GuiMl|1784, p. 11]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

But there were as well other practices which could not be explained by the Boethian diagram and its use of ''tonus'' and ''semitonium''. The authors of one theoretical tonary of the compilation called ''alia musica'' used an alternative intonation with the name AIANEOEANE, the name was obviously taken from a Byzantine ''enechema'' ἅγια νεανὲς, a kind of Mesos tetartos with the finalis and basis on a low E, and applied the Byzantine practice to certain pieces of Roman-Frankish chant which were classified as "tonus tertius" or "Autentus deuterus".&lt;ref&gt;See the edition of [[Jacques Chailley]] ([[#Cha65|1965, pp. 141f]]), which is based on the commented and earlier version of Brussels very close to another [[#AliaHartvic|version attributed to Hartvic]] in a treatise collection of the Abbey St. Emmeram ([http://daten.digitale-sammlungen.de/bsb00034237/image_179 folio 177 verso]). In his contribution to the conference "Byzanz in Europa" Oliver Gerlach described this example as a Byzantine import ([[#Ger12|2012]]). According to him certain practices of Greek psaltes must have made a great impression on some French or German cantors, it is also an interesting early document of the Byzantine practice that the interval between the ''phthongoi'' α and β could have a very particular low intonation, at least within the tetartos melos. It is an early testimony of the melos which is known as "echos legetos" (ἦχος λέγετος) in the current tradition of Orthodox chant.&lt;/ref&gt; In the following section "De quarto tono" the author quotes Aristoxenos' description of the enharmonic and chromatic division of the tetrachord, the remark on it in precisely this section had been probably motivated by the Hagiopolitan concept of the [[Nenano|phthora nenano]] which connected the echos protos on a with the plagios devteros on E.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacques Chailley]] ([[#Cha65|1965, pp. 143f]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval use of transposition (μεταβολή κατὰ τόνον)===

Latin cantors knew about the theoretical concept of the practice of transposition since [[Boethius]]' translation of [[Ptolemy]]. Very few can be said, if they ever understood the practical use of it. Nevertheless, there was a rudimentary knowledge which can be found in the Carolingian treatises ''[[Musica enchiriadis|Musica]]'' and ''[[Scolica enchiriadis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Atkinson ([[#Atk08|2008, pp. 130f]]) and Rebecca Maloy revisited recently ([[#Mal09|2009, pp. 77f]]) the old discussion ([[#Jac1897|Jacobsthal 1897]]) of "non-diatonic" intervals as "absonia" caused by a transposition (μεταβολή κατὰ τόνον), or as "vitia" caused by a change to another genus (μεταβολή κατὰ γένος). Both pointed at the transposition diagrams used in several manuscripts of these treatises—as example [[#ManEn|the manuscript of the Abbey Saint-Amand]], [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b8452596p/f123.item folio 54]. The ''Scolica enchiriadis'' documents a certain understanding that passages within more complex soloistic chant might be transposed which must have caused considerable difficulties for the oral tradition of melodies by troping melismatic structures, so that its memory was supported by poetry.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Musica enchiriadis'' was also the only Latin treatise which documented a second tone system beside the ''systema teleion'', but it does not explain at all, how these both systems worked together in practice.

The Hagiopolites did neither explain it nor did it mention any tone system nor the ''metabole kata tonon'', but this was probably, because the hymn reform of Jerusalem was mainly concerned with simple models exemplified by ''heirmoi'' or ''troparia''. Greek protopsaltes used the transposition only in very few compositions of the [[sticheron|sticherarion]], for instance the compositions passing through all the modes of the Octoechos,&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Husmann ([[#Hus70|1970]]) described them and they were already transcribed into Coislin notation in the earliest sticheraria which can be dated back to the 12th century.&lt;/ref&gt; or certain melismatic elaborations of troparia in the psaltic style, the soloistic style of the Constantinopolitan cathedral rite. This might explain that Charles Atkinson discussed Carolingian theory in comparison with the later ''papadikai'', in which all possible transpositions were represented by the Koukouzelian wheel or by the ''kanônion''.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Atkinson ([[#Atk08|2008, pp. 114-118]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Wheels are also used in Arabic music theory since the 13th century, and [[Al-Farabi]] was the first who started a long tradition of science, which did not only find the proportions of the untransposed diatonic system on the [[oud]] keyboard, but also those of all possible transpositions.&lt;ref&gt;Liberty Manik ([[#Man69|1969]]).&lt;/ref&gt; The use of instruments had to adapt to a very complex tradition which had probably been a rather vocal tradition in its origins.

The '''International Association for Hydro-Environment Engineering and Research''' ('''IAHR'''), founded in 1935, is a worldwide, non-profit, independent organisation of engineers and water specialists working in fields related to the [[hydro-environment]] and in particular with reference to [[hydraulics]] and its practical application. IAHR was called the International Association of Hydraulic Engineering and Research until 2009.

Activities range from river and maritime hydraulics to water resources development, flood risk management and eco-hydraulics, through to [[ice engineering]], [[hydroinformatics]] and continuing education and training. IAHR stimulates and promotes both research and its application, and by so doing strives to contribute to sustainable development, the optimisation of world water resources management and industrial flow processes. IAHR accomplishes its goals by a wide variety of member activities including: working groups, research agenda, congresses, specialty conferences, workshops and short courses; Journals, Monographs and Proceedings; by collaborating with international organisations such as [[UN Water]], [[UNESCO]], [[WMO]], [[IDNDR]], [[Global Water Partnership|GWP]], [[ICSU]]; and by co-operation with other water-related national and international organisations.

IAHR publishes several international scientific journals in collaboration with [[Taylor &amp; Francis]] and [[Elsevier]] – the ''[[Journal of Hydraulic Research]]'', the ''[[Journal of River Basin Management]]'', the ''[[Journal of Water Engineering and Research]]'', the ''[[Revista Iberoamericana del Agua RIBAGUA]]'' jointly with [[WCCE]], the ''[[Journal of Ecohydraulics]]'' and the''[[Journal of Hydro-Environment Engineering and Research]]'' with the Korean Water Resources Association. It also publishes a quarterly magazine called Hydrolink, together with several e-zines!.

The activities of IAHR are carried out by around one hundred volunteer elected officers from around the world supported by a full-time professional secretariat with offices in [[Madrid]], Spain which is hosted by the consortium [[Spain Water]] (composed of [[Centro de Estudios y Experimentación de Obras Públicas|CEDEX]], [[Direccion General del Agua]], [[Direccion General de Costas]], [[MAPAMA]], [[Spain]]), and in [[Beijing]], China hosted by [[IWHR]], and sponsored by [[Suez]] and Hydromodel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cedex.es/CEDEX/lang_castellano//|title=CEDEX|website=Cedex.es|accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.iwhr.com/zswwenglish/index.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-09-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909053941/http://www.iwhr.com/zswwenglish/index.htm |archive-date=2015-09-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The governing body of the association is a council elected by member ballot every two years. The current president is Prof. [[Peter Goodwin]] (US). The current vice presidents are:  Prof. Silke Wieprecht (Germany) (also chair IAHR Hydraulics), Dr. Arturo Marcano (Venezuela), and Prof James Ball (Australia). Dr. Ramon Gutierrez-Serret and Dr Peng Jing are secretary generals. Dr. Christopher George is executive director of the association.

IAHR is a Scientific Associate of the [[International Council for Science]] (ICSU) and is a partner organisation of [[UN-Water]].

The IAHR World Congress is one of the most important activities of the International Association for Hydro-Environment Engineering and Research (IAHR) which typically attracts between 800 and 1500 participants from around the world. The forthcoming world Congress will be in Panama in 2019.

{{broader|Fork (blockchain)|forks}}
[[Bitcoin]] forks are defined variantly as changes in the protocol of the [[bitcoin network]] or as the situations that occur "when two or more blocks have the same block height".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Antonopoulos|first1=Andreas|title=Mastering Bitcoin: Programming the Open Blockchain|date=2017|publisher=O' Reilly media, inc.|location=USA|isbn=978-1491954386|page=Glossary|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fork influences the validity of the [[Communication protocol|rules]]. Forks are typically conducted in order to add new [[software feature|features]] to a blockchain, to reverse the effects of [[computer hacking|hacking]] or catastrophic [[software bug|bugs]]. Forks require [[consensus]] to be resolved or else a permanent split emerges.

==Forks of the client software==
The following are [[software fork|forks]] of the [[software client]] for the [[bitcoin network]]:
* [[Bitcoin XT]] 
* [[Bitcoin Classic]]

==Intended hard forks splitting the cryptocurrency==
Hard forks splitting [[bitcoin]] (aka "split coins") are created via changes of the blockchain rules and sharing a transaction history with bitcoin up to a certain time and date. The first hard fork splitting bitcoin happened on 1 August 2017, resulting in the creation of [[Bitcoin Cash]].

The following is a list of hard forks splitting bitcoin by date and/or block:

* [[Bitcoin Cash]]: Forked at block 478558, {{Date|2017-08-01}}, for each bitcoin (BTC), an owner got 1 Bitcoin Cash (BCH)
* [[Bitcoin Gold]]: Forked at block 491407, {{Date|2017-10-24}}, for each BTC, an owner got 1 Bitcoin Gold (BTG)
* [[Bitcoin Private]]: Forked at block 511346, {{Date|2018-02-28}}, for each Bitcoin (BTC) or ZClassic (ZCL), an owner got 1 Bitcoin Private (BTCP).
* [[Bitcoin SV]]: Forked at block 556766, {{Date|2018-11-15}}, for each Bitcoin Cash (BCH), an owner got 1 Bitcoin SV (BSV).

==Intended soft forks splitting from not-most-work block==
* The fork fixing the value overflow incident was controversial because it was announced after the exploit was mined.

==Unintended hard forks==
Two hard forks were created by "protocol change" definition:
* March 2013 Chain Fork (migration from BerkeleyDB to LevelDB caused a chain split)&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0050.mediawiki March 2013 Chain Fork]&lt;/ref&gt;
* CVE-2018-17144 (Bitcoin 0.15 allowed double spending certain inputs in the same block. Not exploited)

[[Windows 7]] contains many [[Features new to Windows 7|new features]]. However, similarly to the [[List of features removed in Windows Vista|transition from Windows XP to Windows Vista]], certain capabilities and programs that are present in [[Windows Vista]] are no longer present in Windows 7 or have changed. The following is a list of features that originated in earlier versions of Windows and included up to Windows Vista.

==Windows shell==

===Windows Explorer===
{{main|Windows Explorer}}
* Windows 7 removes the "Customize" tab for a folder if its properties are opened via Libraries. If the same folder is opened in Explorer without accessing it via Libraries, the Customize tab is available in its Properties.
* The Registry settings for modified colors for compressed files, EFS-encrypted files, item hot-tracking (single click hover) etc. are ignored by the ItemsView control in Windows 7 Explorer.
* Running Explorer shell as administrator or even opening an Explorer window temporarily as administrator is not possible in Windows 7 without modifying permissions in the registry of system values because of a [[Distributed Component Object Model|DCOM]] restriction.{{cn|date=November 2017}}
* [[Control Panel (Windows)|Control Panel]] views are limited to ''Small icons'' and ''Large icons'' (which is actually ''Tiles view''). ''List view'', ''Details view'', ''Extra large icons view'', ''Large icons view'' and ''Medium icons view'' with text at the bottom are not available. The ability to show Control Panel items in groups is also removed.
* IDeskBand interface and Explorer Bars are no longer supported in Windows Explorer but still supported in Internet Explorer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa753590(v=vs.85).aspx Adding Explorer Bars]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some Control Panel settings, such as Add Hardware, Bluetooth, Game Controllers, Pen and Touch, People Near Me, Tablet PC Settings, Offline Files, and Scanners and Cameras, are not listed, even under ''All Control Panel Items''. The 32-bit Speech applet is no longer accessible through the Control Panel. While some of these settings are accessible only from Category view, or by searching, they can be made accessible via ''All Control Panel Items'' with a modification to the [[Windows Registry|registry]].{{which|date=October 2018}}
* The slide show button from Windows Explorer starts the Windows Photo Viewer, which—unlike Windows Live Photo Gallery—does not support viewing slide shows with themes and rich transitions.
* It is not possible to run the 32-bit version of Windows Explorer as a file manager or as the shell in 64-bit editions of Windows 7.&lt;ref&gt;[http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en/w7itproui/thread/e237260d-ca42-4fbc-a657-89796d884715 Has the implementation of the 32-bit Windows Explorer changed in the RC?]&lt;/ref&gt; 64-bit editions of Windows Vista and Windows XP allowed executing the 32-bit shell/Windows Explorer and making it the default for compatibility with [[shell extension]]s. As a result, all 32-bit shell extensions are incompatible with 64-bit versions of Windows 7.
* Because of the Software Explorer being removed from [[Windows Defender]], there is no user notification any more if [[User Account Control|UAC]] blocks a startup program which needs administrator privileges. Users were notified about blocked startup programs set to run as administrator in [[Windows Vista]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/930367 Error message when you start a Windows Vista-based computer: "Windows has blocked some startup programs"]&lt;/ref&gt;
* An undocumented incompatible ''Items view'' control replaces the ''List view'' control&lt;ref&gt;[https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd744693(WS.10).aspx Windows Browse and Organize Features: Windows 7 Technical Library]&lt;/ref&gt; used in Windows Explorer and Start Menu breaking applications that customized the Explorer list view control.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/sysexp.html SysExporter incompatibility with Windows 7 Explorer]&lt;/ref&gt; The Item view also does not support custom positioning, custom ordering, or hyperlinks, which were supported in the Windows Vista list view.&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd378351(VS.85).aspx IFolderViewOptions Interface]&lt;/ref&gt; Because the control is undocumented, it is not possible for developers to disable auto arrange or customize views. Because ItemsView is not considered part of the Win32 common controls reusable by developers, the sound for the ''Select'' system event no longer plays in Explorer in Windows 7.&lt;ref&gt;[http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/fba96c21-93bb-4bf4-94ed-dd32b1b0cb82 The "select" event system sound does not play when a file or folder is selected]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The new items view control also ignores certain &lt;code&gt;desktop.ini&lt;/code&gt; parameters like &lt;code&gt;IconArea_Image&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;IconArea_Text&lt;/code&gt; preventing users from setting a background picture for folders. In Windows Vista, this feature was not built-in, however the list view control supported this if shell extensions or folder customization utilities which set the correct desktop.ini parameters and attributes were installed.
* Each toolbar or desk band is forced to be on its own row in Windows Explorer. Windows Explorer forces the RBBS_BREAK style for every band.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.codeproject.com/KB/shell/classicshell.aspx Classic Shell: Codeproject.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
* When items are grouped by any criteria, multiple selection of groups by clicking the group header while holding down {{keypress|Ctrl}} is not possible as could be done in Windows Vista.&lt;ref&gt;[http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en/w7itproui/thread/23c345bd-8cb3-40e2-810e-e563c24f3c1d What happened to the Group by, Sort by, Stack by Column Header Context Menu?]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The entire folder tree view in the navigation pane cannot be collapsed vertically as could be done in Windows Explorer on Windows Vista.
* Full row selection cannot be turned off for ''details view'' as was possible in Windows Vista.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.mchsi.com/~k.miller79/ Disable Full Row Select: Keith's Windows Stuff] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429105810/http://home.mchsi.com/~k.miller79/ |date=2010-04-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Share overlay icon for shared items in Explorer has been removed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/a343b94a-d864-4607-a2c1-a5a06c2a79c6 Why Windows 7 did not have a different icon for share folder?: Technet Forums]&lt;/ref&gt;
* When navigating to a folder from a library, it is not possible to view the folder's contents in the view the user has set or customized. The folder uses the library's view.
* The ''Remember each folder's view settings'' option to set Explorer to persist or not persist folder views and icon sizes per folder has been removed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-files/is-remember-each-folders-view-settings/633192ab-e435-48cd-8fcd-999e7195653c Is Remember each folder's view settings functionality gone for good?]&lt;/ref&gt;
* It is not possible to set Windows Explorer to remember individual folder window sizes and positions. Each folder window shares the same size, and their position cascades as more windows are opened.
* Dotted lines that connect folders and subfolders do not appear as the option to turn off simple folder view is missing.&lt;ref name="microsoft1"&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/282002 Description of Simple Folder View in Windows XP]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="microsoft2"&gt;[http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/help/3a3bfe59-5268-4fb3-81c5-7972c28939cd1033.mspx#section_2 Change folder views and behavior]&lt;/ref&gt;
* When clicking on a folder in the folders pane, it isn't automatically expanded to show its subfolders as the option to turn on simple folder view is missing.&lt;ref name="microsoft1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="microsoft2"/&gt;
* The size of any ''selected item(s)'' is not shown on the status bar but is shown in the ''details pane'' just above the status bar. Free disk space is not shown on the status bar and the status bar is not visible by default. The details pane only shows the size of 15 selected items by default and viewing the total size of more than 15 selected items requires clicking "Show more details" each time the selection changes. &lt;!--Windows 7 doesn't even show size for selected items on the status bar. It only shows size on the details pane. Vista only removed the size for unselected items. --&gt;
* When no items are selected in a folder, neither the details pane nor the status bar show the total size of files in the folder.
* Icons on the command bar in Windows Explorer and common application dialogs for Open/Save.
* Disabling ''Auto Arrange'' and ''Align to Grid'' is not available in Windows Explorer windows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neowin.net/forum/index.php?s=9d78d8b664092caae90f2db6d2c5a264&amp;showtopic=766326&amp;st=0&amp;p=590933708&amp;#entry590933708 Disable Auto Arrange in folder view, not available in W7]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7files/thread/91d630f0-c18d-4eaa-889b-e0ecaffa5a94 How to manually arrange folders in windows 7]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, users can no longer manually arrange items via drag and drop within a folder; this feature is only available on the desktop.
* The bar with column headers for sorting, grouping, filtering and stacking that appears for any view in Windows Vista Explorer only appears for ''Details'' view.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.windows7taskforce.com/view/906 Sort/Group bar has been banished from every view except Details view]&lt;/ref&gt; Even in details view, the column headers only allow sorting and filtering; they no longer allow grouping and stacking. As a result, grouping must be done from the context menu in all views and sorting must also be done from the context menu in all other views except Details view. Filtering by columns can only be done in Details view.
* Automatic horizontal scrolling in the left pane is removed as well as the horizontal scrollbar to manually scroll.
* The Arrange By option (called Stack By in Windows Vista) is only available for libraries and folders included in libraries. In addition, users can only Stack By predefined categories depending on the library type. For example, users can only Stack by Folder, Album, Artist, Song, Genre, and Rating for the Music library, whereas in Vista, users could Stack By any properties that exist for a file (common examples would be bit rate, year, composer, play count, etc. for audio files).
* Changing the sort criteria when multiple items are selected causes all items to be de-selected.
* Selection of multiple items is not retained across back and forward navigation.

===Taskbar===
{{Main|Taskbar}}
* Tooltips for program icons only show the name of the app. They no longer show the comment field.
* 16-bit applications can no longer display their icon on the taskbar when running. The taskbar shows the icon for NTVDM.exe, which is the 32-bit host process for running 16-bit applications.
* Quick Launch was removed in favor of 'pinned' applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What happened to the Quick Launch toolbar?|url=http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/windows7/what-happened-to-the-quick-launch-toolbar|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=13 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible to revert to Quick Launch by manually adding it as a custom toolbar referencing ''%AppData%\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Quick Launch''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Heddings|first=Lowell|title=Add the Quick Launch Bar to the Taskbar in Windows 7|url=http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-7/add-the-quick-launch-bar-to-the-taskbar-in-windows-7/|publisher=How-To-Geek|accessdate=13 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (check citation for how-to), although Windows 7 and later have issues with Quick Launch getting automatically disabled and all its settings getting reset after a logoff or restart.&lt;ref&gt;[http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7desktop/thread/8e85e5e3-c52b-446c-b727-e3a549d38995 Quick Launch bar in Windows 7 keeps disappearing after every restart]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7desktop/thread/a0d11462-a730-4a08-84d0-29399745a4af A toolbar disappears from the task bar. (Quick launch toolbar)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7desktop/thread/3aa11b2c-e430-4007-be06-c7344606f6a2 Quick launch disappears after restart]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Clicking a grouped application's taskbar button or thumbnail when it is active (in the foreground) does not minimize it. Only ungrouped application buttons minimize upon being clicked again.
* Icons have been removed from the tooltips for the notification area system icons such as ''Volume'', ''Network'', ''Power'' and the taskbar date and time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa511448.aspx#richtooltips Notification Area Guidelines: MSDN]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Floating [[Taskbar#Desktop toolbars|Deskbands]] (toolbars) are no longer available. The feature was previously deprecated in Windows Vista; all deskbands can only be pinned to the taskbar. It is no longer possible to place toolbars on the other (non-taskbar) edges of the desktop.
* The ability to disable grouping (placing next to each other) similar taskbar buttons (for example, Explorer windows) is removed; users can still disable ''combining'' multiple taskbar buttons of the same type into one button.
* The configurable registry option ''TaskbarGroupSize'', which allowed fine-grained control over taskbar grouping&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/Q281628 How to Change the Behavior of Taskbar Grouping]&lt;/ref&gt; under previous Windows versions is not supported. In Windows 7, users can only configure to either combine buttons, not combine or combine when the taskbar is full.
* The number of combined taskbar windows is not calculated and shown next to the combined buttons.
* Network activity animation on Network Connections icon in the notification area cannot be turned on. The Network icon only indicates the type of network (wired or wireless) and Internet connectivity.
* The ability to turn off taskbar window previews (thumbnails) while still using [[Windows Aero|Aero]], as was configurable in Windows Vista.&lt;ref&gt;[http://download.microsoft.com/download/b/0/4/b04f83c7-ef12-4d16-9df7-cd5ce0d068de/Windows_Vista_UX_Walkthrough.doc Windows Vista User Experience Walkthrough Guide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605002521/http://download.microsoft.com/download/b/0/4/b04f83c7-ef12-4d16-9df7-cd5ce0d068de/Windows_Vista_UX_Walkthrough.doc |date=2011-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible to turn off taskbar thumbnails when two or more windows are combined by setting a registry value, though.&lt;ref&gt;[http://damnmachine.com/309/windows-7-taskbar-reg-tweaks.html Windows 7 Taskbar reg tweaks]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ability to disable the taskbar's "always on top" setting is removed.
* When grouping is disabled, the ability to manage multiple taskbar items using multiselect (Ctrl+click) to tile, cascade, minimize or close the ''selected group of'' windows has been removed.
* Only two power plans, one of them always being ''Balanced'', and the other being "Power saver" by default, are available to choose from the taskbar. The "High Performance" power plan is hidden by default in the Control Panel. 
* When the taskbar is vertical, there cannot be multiple columns of icons.

===Start menu===
{{main|Start menu}}
* Applications can no longer be excluded from appearing in the Start Menu's ''Most Frequently Used'' program list using the ''NoStartPage'' registry value as was possible in Windows XP and Windows Vista.&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/284198 How To Prevent a Program from Being Displayed in the Most Frequently Used Programs List in Windows XP]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Programs started from outside the Start Menu such as from the Desktop, the Run dialog or from folders no longer show up in the Start Menu's Frequently Used Programs list, unless launched at least once from the Start Menu.
* Classic [[Start menu]] is removed. Certain features that were present only in the Classic Start menu are not available, such as expanding the menu columns instead of scrolling, expanding folders by hovering instead of clicking, opening folders by double clicking, launching multiple programs by holding down Shift key while clicking, and creating expandable shortcuts to folders by dragging them to the Start menu.
* Dynamically pinning default Internet browser and e-mail client software programs on Start menu is no longer possible. Programs can still be, however, manually pinned to the Start menu in Windows 7.
* Internet Explorer Favorites and History are no longer grouped under a separate header in the Windows 7 Start Menu as they were in the Windows Vista Start Menu. They are shown under the Files group.

===Windows Search features===
{{main|Windows Search}}
* Advanced search builder UI (''Search Pane''). Due to the removal of this UI, it is not possible to change the location of where to search in the same Explorer window unless at least one search has already been performed, after which Explorer shows a button to search a "Custom" scope. For saved searches (stacked views), changing the scope of the search (location for example) is no longer possible because of this removal.
* The option to always search only file names has been removed from Folder Options, Search tab.
* The [[Windows Search]] protocol handler addin to index network paths is incompatible with [[Windows 7]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/918996 Availability of the Windows Desktop Search add-in for Files on Microsoft Networks]&lt;/ref&gt; The Windows Search service needs to be installed and running on the remote computers to search them.
* Pre-defined saved searches in the ''Searches'' folder ("''Recent Documents''," "''Recent E-mail''," "''Recent Music''," "''Recent Pictures and Video''," "''Recently Changed''," and "''Shared by Me''") have been removed.

===Other shell features===
{{Main|Windows shell}}
* The ''Snap To'' mouse pointer option to move the pointer automatically to the ''default button'' in a dialog is broken on many re-designed system and application dialog boxes and windows in Windows 7. The mouse pointer simply does not move or ''snap to'' the default button in several dialogs which are re-designed.
* For security reasons, [[AutoPlay]] will support [[AutoRun]] only on optical media, such as CDs and DVDs. (Later Microsoft released KB971029&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971029 KB971029 – Update to the AutoPlay functionality in Windows]&lt;/ref&gt; for earlier OSes to make AutoPlay Windows 7-like.)
* Detection of the discontinued [[HD DVD]] format in AutoPlay.
* Properties such as target command line with switches, ''start in'' path, icon and compatibility mode cannot be changed for game shortcuts in ''Games Explorer''.

==Personalization==
* In the ''Personalization'' control panel, it is not possible to save changes to an existing theme. Changes made after choosing a theme must be saved again and the original theme deleted to prevent duplication. In previous versions of Windows, a theme file could be overwritten with the modified theme.
* The ''Aurora'', ''Windows Energy'' and ''Windows Logo'' screensavers and the [[Computer wallpaper|wallpapers]] that shipped with [[Windows Vista]] were removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Protalinski |first=Emil |title=Side by side: UI changes from Windows 7 beta to build 7057 |publisher=Ars Technica |date=2009-03-16 |url= https://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2009/03/side-by-side-ui-changes-from-windows-7-beta-to-build-7057.ars  |accessdate=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 3D-Bronze, 3D-White, Conductor, Dinosaur, Hands 1, Hands 2, Variations and Windows Animated cursor schemes are removed and no longer available.
* [[ClearType]] cannot be turned off entirely in order for the user interface font, ''Segoe UI'', to maintain optimal design for certain shell components and [[Windows Explorer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.msdn.com/e7/archive/2009/06/23/engineering-changes-to-cleartype-in-windows-7.aspx Engineering Changes to ClearType in Windows 7]&lt;/ref&gt; Parts of the user interface (such as the start menu and Explorer) still use ClearType regardless of setting.
* Icon size setting in the Advanced Appearance settings opened via Personalization dialog no longer affects icon sizes in Windows Explorer and on the Desktop.

==Windows Media Player features==
{{main|Windows Media Player}}
* The ability to lock the player while in full-screen mode &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/lock-the-screen-while-in-full-screen-mode-in-windows-media-player/ Lock The Screen While in Full-Screen Mode in Windows Media Player]&lt;/ref&gt; using a 4-digit PIN has been removed.
* The option to adjust the bit rate when burning data CDs has been removed.
* [[Windows Media Player]]'s taskbar-integrated Mini-player has been removed. The thumbnail preview which replaces this lacks volume control and a progress bar. The ability to start the miniplayer only for certain files based on specific text in their file names was also removed.
* Enhancements are only accessible from Now Playing view in a floating window. They do not dock to the Now Playing window, and do not get restored when Windows Media Player is restarted. Even when manually restored, their position does not get saved.
* Left/Right balance control has been removed from the graphic equalizer and is no longer possible.
* Several player preferences are not saved and restored upon restarting the player. The playlist pane in Now Playing view is not shown automatically. Enhancements do not get restored when Windows Media Player is restarted. Even when manually restored, the previous position of the ''Now Playing'' window and enhancements is not retained.
* The context menu entry "Find In Library" which allowed locating the ''Now Playing'' song in the library was removed.
* ''Advanced Tag Editor'', ''Color Chooser'', ''Media Link for E-mail'', and ''Party Mode'' features have been removed.
* The ability to add and show static lyrics and synchronized lyrics has been removed.
* ''Recently added'' Auto playlist is not included by default.
* Total time for CDs and playlists is rounded up to the nearest minute, i.e. seconds are no longer shown.

==Internet Explorer features==
{{Main|Internet Explorer}}
* In [[Internet Explorer 8]], the previous session can no longer be automatically restored the next time. The user must remember to and manually open the session the next time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.msdn.com/b/askie/archive/2009/03/16/open-these-the-next-time-i-use-internet-explorer-no-longer-an-option-in-ie-8.aspx “Open these the next time I use Internet Explorer” no longer an option in IE 8]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Internet Explorer 8]] on any Windows version does not support inline AutoComplete in its address bar.&lt;ref name="AddBarIE8"&gt;[http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2008/03/11/address-bar-improvements-in-internet-explorer-8-beta-1.aspx Address Bar Improvements in Internet Explorer 8 Beta 1]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rating and description of Internet Explorer favorites can no longer be edited from the Details pane in Windows 7 Explorer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2568750 "Apply Property Error" occurs when attempting to modify either the Ratings, Description or Notes fields of a Favorite shortcut on Windows 7 with either Internet Explorer 8 or 9]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications replaced by Windows Live counterparts==
{{Main|Windows Live}}
* [[Windows Photo Gallery]], [[Windows Movie Maker]], and [[Windows Mail]] have been removed, in favor of downloading respective [[Windows Live]] counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=LeBlanc |first=Brandon|title=The Complete Windows Experience – Windows 7 + Windows Live |work=Windows Experience Blog |publisher=Microsoft |date=2008-10-28 |url= http://windowsteamblog.com/blogs/windowsexperience/archive/2008/10/28/the-complete-windows-experience-windows-7-windows-live.aspx  |accessdate=2009-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Windows Live Mail]] and [[Windows Live Movie Maker]] do not include all of the features of Windows Mail and Windows Movie Maker respectively.
** Windows Live Mail does not support HTML source editing, scripted stationery and the ability to disable the splash screen.
** The Windows Mail gadget for [[Windows SideShow]] does not ship with Windows 7.
** Windows Live Movie Maker does not include a proper timeline with audio edits and narration,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Perez |first=Sarah |title=Miss the Old Movie Maker? Get it Back on Windows 7 |work=Channel 9 |publisher=[[Microsoft Developer Network]] |date=2009-02-10 |url= http://on10.net/blogs/sarahintampa/Miss-the-Old-Movie-Maker-Get-it-Back-on-Windows-7/?CommentID=25016  |accessdate=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; title overlays, filter compatibility settings and other advanced options, cannot export to [[DV-AVI]], and drops the transitions and effects from Windows Movie Maker.
* The ''web filtering'' and ''activity reporting'' functionality from the in-box parental controls feature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd630560(VS.85).aspx Windows 7 Parental Controls Changes Overview]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Windows Live Family Safety]] replaces the ''web filtering'' functionality but its user interface for filtering and activity reporting is web-based instead of the native UI used by Windows Vista's parental controls and requires logging into a [[Microsoft account|Windows Live ID (now Microsoft account)]].
* [[Windows Calendar]] has also been removed, in favor of Windows Live Mail's calendar.&lt;!--Please do not say it was replaced by Windows Live Calendar without a source.--&gt;
**Windows Live Mail's integrated calendar supports events but not tasks, does not support subscribing, publishing, importing and exporting [[iCalendar]] files.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="58795">'''Large volume volcanic eruptions in the Basin and Range Province''' include [[Basin and Range Province|Basin and Range]] eruptions in [[California]], [[Idaho]], [[Colorado]], [[New Mexico]], [[Texas]], [[Arizona]], [[Nevada]], [[Wyoming]] and [[Oregon]], as well as those of the [[Long Valley Caldera]] geological province and the [[Yellowstone hotspot]].

==Volcanic fields==
Some of the [[volcanic field]]s of the Basin and Range Province are within: Northwestern Nevada, the [[Modoc Plateau]], Central Nevada, the [[Great Basin]], Southwestern Nevada, the [[Mojave Desert]], and the [[Long Valley Caldera]] region. Named ones include: [[Coso Volcanic Field]], [[Mono–Inyo Craters|Mono Lake Volcanic Field]], [[Marysvale Volcanic Field]], [[San Juan volcanic field]], Indian Peak, [[Central Colorado volcanic field]], [[Jemez Mountains|Jemez]] volcanic lineament, [[Mogollon-Datil volcanic field]], Santa Rosa-Calico, and [[Boot Heel volcanic field]].

==Geological features==
Many geological features in [[Western United States]] have a Northeastern orientation, the [[North American craton]] motion has the same orientation as well.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, R.L. and Luedke, R.G. (1984).&lt;/ref&gt; For example: the Trans-Challis fault zone, [[Idaho]]; the [[Snake River]] in [[Oregon]]; the [[Garlock Fault]], [[California]]; the [[Colorado River]] in [[Utah]]; the [[Colorado Mineral Belt]]; [[Yucca Mountain|Crater Flat]]-[[Reveille Range]]-[[Lunar Crater National Natural Landmark|Lunar Crater]] lineament, the Northwestern Nevada volcanic field; the San Juan caldera cluster, [[Colorado]]; the [[Mogollon-Datil volcanic field|Socorro-Magdalena caldera cluster]], [[New Mexico]]; Jemez volcanic lineament ([[Raton hotspot]] trail); and the Yellowstone hotspot trail. But the Yellowstone hotspot trail was modified through [[Fault (geology)|fault]]s and [[Extension (geology)|extension]].

==Geology==
Prior to the Eocene Epoch (55.8 ±0.2 to 33.9 ±0.1&amp;nbsp;Ma) the convergence rate of the Farallon and North American Plates was fast and the angle of subduction was shallow. During the [[Eocene]] the [[Farallon Plate]] [[subduction]]-associated compressive forces of the [[Laramide orogeny]] ended, plate interactions changed from orthogonal compression to oblique strike-slip, and volcanism in the Basin and Range Province flared up. It is suggested that this plate continued to be underthrust until about 19&amp;nbsp;Ma, at which time it was completely consumed and volcanic activity ceased, in part. [[Olivine basalt]] from the [[oceanic ridge]] erupted around 17&amp;nbsp;Ma and [[extension (geology)|extension]] began.&lt;ref&gt;McKee, E. H. (1971).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

(2004).&lt;/ref&gt; The extension resulted in roughly north-south-trending faults, the [[Great Basin]], the [[Walker Lane|Walker trough]], the [[Owens Valley|Owens]] [[graben]], and the [[Rio Grande rift]], for instance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6172">This is a list of various types of '''equilibrium''', the condition of a [[system]] in which all competing influences are balanced.

==Biology==
* [[Equilibrioception]], the sense of a balance present in human beings and animals
* [[Equilibrium unfolding]], the process of unfolding a protein or RNA molecule by gradually changing its environment
* [[Genetic equilibrium]], theoretical state in which a population is not evolving
* [[Homeostasis]], the ability of an open system, especially living organisms, to regulate its internal environment
* [[Punctuated equilibrium]], theory in evolutionary biology
* [[Sedimentation equilibrium]], analytical ultracentrifugation method for measuring protein molecular masses in solution
* Equilibrium Theory ([[Island biogeography]]), MacArthur-Wilson theory explaining biodiversity character of ecological islands
* [[Osmotic equilibrium]]

==Physics==
* [[Equilibrant Force]], which keeps any object motionless and acts on virtually every object in the world that is not moving
* [[Hydrostatic equilibrium|Equilibrium figure]]s of Earth and planets (physical geodesy)
* [[Equilibrium mode distribution]], the state of fiber optic or waveguide transmission in which the propagation mode does not vary with distance along the fiber or changes in the launch mode
* [[Hydrostatic equilibrium]], the state of a system in which compression due to gravity is balanced by a pressure gradient force
* [[Hyperbolic equilibrium point]], a mathematical concept in physics
* [[Mechanical equilibrium]], the state in which the sum of the forces, and torque, on each particle of the system is zero
* [[Radiative equilibrium]], the state where the energy radiated is balanced by the energy absorbed
* [[Secular equilibrium]], a state of radioactive elements in which the production rate of a daughter nucleus is balanced by its own decay rate
* [[Thermodynamic equilibrium]], the state of a thermodynamic system which is in thermal, mechanical, and chemical equilibrium (see below). When it is said that a system is simply "in equilibrium", this is often what is meant.

==Chemistry==
* [[Chemical equilibrium]], the state in which the concentrations of the reactants and products have stopped changing in time.
* [[Diffusive equilibrium]], when the concentrations of each type of particle have stopped changing.
* [[Thermal equilibrium]], a state where an object and its surroundings cease to exchange energy in the form of heat, i.e. they are at the same temperature.
* [[Gibbs–Donnan effect|Donnan equilibrium]], the distribution of ion species between two ionic solutions separated by a semipermeable membrane or boundary
* [[Dynamic equilibrium]], the state in which two reversible processes occur at the same rate
* [[Equilibrium constant]], a quantity characterizing a chemical equilibrium in a chemical reaction
* [[Partition equilibrium]], a type of chromatography that is typically used in GC
* [[Quasistatic equilibrium]], the quasi-balanced state of a thermodynamic system near to equilibrium in some sense or degree
* [[Schlenk equilibrium]], a chemical equilibrium named after its discoverer Wilhelm Schlenk taking place in solutions of Grignard reagents
* [[Solubility equilibrium]], any chemical equilibrium between solid and dissolved states of a compound at saturation
* [[Vapor–liquid equilibrium]], where the rates of condensation and vapourization of a material are equal

==Economics==
* [[Competitive equilibrium]], economic equilibrium when all buyers and sellers are small relative to the market
* [[Economic equilibrium]], a condition in economics
* [[Economic equilibrium|Equilibrium price]], the price at which quantity supplied equals quantity demanded
* [[General equilibrium theory]], a branch of theoretical microeconomics that studies multiple individual markets
* [[Intertemporal equilibrium]], an equilibrium concept over time
* [[Lindahl equilibrium]], a method proposed by Erik Lindahl for financing public goods
* [[supply and demand|Partial equilibrium]], the equilibrium price and quantity which come from the cross of supply and demand in a competitive market.
* [[Radner equilibrium]], an economic concept defined by economist Roy Radner in the context of general equilibrium
* [[Recursive competitive equilibrium]], an economic equilibrium concept associated with a dynamic program
* [[Economic equilibrium|Static equilibrium (economics)]], the intersection of supply and demand in any market
* [[Sunspots (economics)|Sunspot equilibrium]], an economic equilibrium in which non-fundamental factors affect prices or quantities
* [[Underemployment equilibrium]], a situation in Keynesian economics with a persistent shortfall relative to full employment and potential output

==Game theory==
* [[Correlated equilibrium]], a solution concept in game theory that is more general than the well-known Nash equilibrium
* [[Nash equilibrium]], a solution concept in game theory involving two or more players
** [[Quasi-perfect equilibrium]], a refinement of Nash Equilibrium for extensive form games due to Eric van Damme
** [[Sequential equilibrium]], a refinement of Nash Equilibrium for extensive form games due to David M. Kreps and Robert Wilson
* [[Symmetric equilibrium]], in game theory, an equilibrium where all players use the same strategy
* [[Trembling hand perfect equilibrium]] assumes that the players, through a "slip of the hand" or tremble, may choose unintended strategies
** [[Proper equilibrium]] due to Roger B. Myerson, where costly trembles are made with smaller probabilities

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31780">In [[physics]], '''natural units''' are [[physical units]] of [[measurement]] based only on universal [[physical constants]]. For example, the [[elementary charge]] {{math|''e''}} is a natural unit of [[electric charge]], and the [[speed of light]] {{math|''c''}} is a natural unit of [[speed]]. A purely natural [[system of units]] has all of its units defined in this way, and usually such that the numerical values of the selected physical constants in terms of these units are exactly ''dimensionless'' {{math|1}}. These constants are then typically omitted from mathematical expressions of physical laws, and while this has the apparent advantage of simplicity, it may entail a loss of clarity due to the loss of information for [[dimensional analysis]]. It precludes the interpretation of an expression in terms of fundamental physical constants, such as {{mvar|e}} and {{mvar|c}}, unless it is ''known'' which units (in dimensionful units) the expression is supposed to have. In this case, the reinsertion of the correct powers of {{math|''e''}}, {{math|''c''}}, etc., can be uniquely determined.

==Introduction==
Natural units are intended to [[Nondimensionalization|elegantly simplify]] particular [[algebraic expression]]s appearing in the laws of physics or to [[Normalizing constant|normalize]] some chosen physical quantities that are properties of universal [[elementary particle]]s and are reasonably believed to be constant. However, there is a choice of which quantities to set to unity in a natural system of units, and quantities which are set to unity in one system may take a different value or even be assumed to vary in another natural unit system.

Natural units are "natural" because the origin of their definition comes only from properties of [[nature]] and not from any human construct. [[Planck units]] are often, without qualification, called "natural units", although they constitute only one of several systems of natural units, albeit the best known such system. Planck units (up to a simple multiplier for each unit) might be considered one of the most "natural" systems in that the set of units is not based on properties of any [[prototype]], object, or [[subatomic particle|particle]] but are solely derived from the properties of [[free space]].

As with other [[systems of units]], the base units of a set of natural units will include definitions and values for [[length]], [[mass]], [[time]], [[temperature]], and [[electric charge]] (in lieu of [[electric current]]). It is possible to disregard temperature as a [[fundamental units|fundamental physical quantity]], since it states the energy per degree of freedom of a particle, which can be expressed in terms of energy (or mass, length, and time). Virtually every system of natural units normalizes [[Boltzmann's constant]] {{math|''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;}} to 1, which can be thought of as simply a way of defining the unit temperature.

In [[SI]], electric charge is a separate fundamental dimension of physical quantity, but in natural unit systems charge is expressed in terms of the mechanical units of mass, length, and time, similarly to [[cgs]]. There are two common ways to relate charge to mass, length, and time: In [[Lorentz–Heaviside units]] (also called "rationalized"), [[Coulomb's law]] is {{math|1=''F'' = {{sfrac|''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;|4π''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}}}, and in [[Gaussian units]] (also called "non-rationalized"), Coulomb's law is {{math|1=''F'' = {{sfrac|''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;|''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}}}.&lt;ref&gt;Kowalski, Ludwik, 1986, "[http://alpha.montclair.edu/~kowalskiL/SI/SI_PAGE.HTML A Short History of the SI Units in Electricity,] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429035624/http://alpha.montclair.edu/~kowalskiL/SI/SI_PAGE.HTML |date=2009-04-29 }}"  ''The Physics Teacher'' 24(2): 97–99. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1119/1.2341955 Alternate web link (subscription required)]&lt;/ref&gt; Both possibilities are incorporated into different natural unit systems.

==Notation and use==

Natural units are most commonly used by ''setting the units to one''. For example, many natural unit systems include the equation {{math|1=''c'' = 1}} in the unit-system definition, where {{math|''c''}} is the [[speed of light]]. If a velocity {{math|''v''}} is half the speed of light, then as {{math|1=''v'' = {{sfrac|''c''|2}}}} and {{math|1=''c'' = 1}}, hence {{math|1=''v'' = {{sfrac|1|2}}}}. The equation {{math|1=''v'' = {{sfrac|1|2}}}} means "the velocity {{math|''v''}} has the value one-half when measured in Planck units", or "the velocity {{math|''v''}} is one-half the Planck unit of velocity".

The equation {{math|1=''c'' = 1}} can be plugged in anywhere else. For example, Einstein's equation {{math|1=''E'' = ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} can be rewritten in Planck units as {{math|1=''E'' = ''m''}}. This equation means "The energy of a particle, measured in Planck units of energy, equals the mass of the particle, measured in Planck units of mass."

=== Advantages and disadvantages ===
Compared to [[SI]] or other unit systems, natural units have both advantages and disadvantages:

*'''Simplified equations:''' By setting constants to 1, equations containing those constants appear more compact and in some cases may be simpler to understand. For example, the [[invariant mass|special relativity]] equation {{math|1=''E''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''m''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''c''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;}} appears somewhat complicated, but the natural units version, {{math|1=''E''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''m''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, appears simpler.
*'''Physical interpretation:''' Natural unit systems automatically subsume [[dimensional analysis]]. For example, in [[Planck units]], the units are defined by properties of quantum mechanics and gravity. Not coincidentally, the Planck unit of length is approximately the distance at which [[quantum gravity]] effects become important. Likewise, [[atomic units]] are based on the mass and charge of an electron, and not coincidentally the atomic unit of length is the [[Bohr radius]] describing the "orbit" of the electron in a [[hydrogen atom]].
*'''No prototypes:''' A [[Prototype#Metrology|prototype]] is a physical object that defines a unit, such as the [[kilogram|International Prototype Kilogram]], a physical cylinder of metal whose mass is by definition exactly one [[kilogram]]. A prototype definition always has imperfect reproducibility between different places and between different times, and it is an advantage of natural unit systems that they use no prototypes. (They share this advantage with other ''non-natural'' unit systems, such as [[conventional electrical units]].)
*'''Less precise measurements:''' [[SI]] units are designed to be used in precision measurements. For example, the [[second]] is defined by an atomic transition frequency in cesium atoms, because this transition frequency can be precisely reproduced with [[atomic clock]] technology. Natural unit systems are generally ''not'' based on quantities that can be precisely reproduced in a lab. Therefore, in order to retain the same degree of precision, the fundamental constants used still have to be measured in a laboratory in terms of physical objects that can be directly observed. If this is not possible, then a quantity expressed in natural units can be less precise than the same quantity expressed in SI units. For example, Planck units use the [[gravitational constant|gravitational constant {{math|''G''}}]], which is measurable in a laboratory only to four significant digits.

==Choosing constants to normalize==
Out of the many [[physical constant]]s, the designer of a system of natural unit systems must choose a few of these constants to normalize (set equal to 1). It is not possible to normalize just ''any'' set of constants. For example, the mass of a proton and the mass of an electron cannot both be normalized: if the mass of an electron is defined to be 1, then the mass of a proton has to be approximately 1836. In a less trivial example, the [[fine-structure constant]], {{math|''α'' ≈ {{sfrac|137}}}}, cannot be set to 1 because it is a dimensionless number defined in terms of other quantities. The fine-structure constant is related to other physical constants through {{math|''α'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''k''{{sub|e}}''e''{{sup|2}}|''ħc''}}}}, where {{math|''k''{{sub|e}}}} is the [[Coulomb constant]], {{math|''e''}} is the [[elementary charge]], {{math|''ħ''}} is the [[reduced Planck constant]], and {{math|''c''}} is the [[speed of light]]. Thus, we cannot set all of {{math|''k''{{sub|e}}}}, {{math|''e''}}, {{math|''ħ''}}, and {{math|''c''}} to 1, we can normalize at most three of this set to 1.

==Electromagnetism units==
{{main|Lorentz–Heaviside units|Gaussian units}}
In [[SI units]], electric charge is expressed in coulombs, a separate unit which is additional to the "mechanical" units (mass, length, time), even though the traditional definition of the ampere refers to some of these other units. In natural unit systems, however, electric charge has units of {{math|[mass]&lt;sup&gt;{{frac|2}}&lt;/sup&gt; [length]&lt;sup&gt;{{frac|3|2}}&lt;/sup&gt; [time]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

In order to build natural units in electromagnetism one can use:
*'''[[Lorentz–Heaviside units]]''' (classified as a '''rationalized''' system of electromagnetism units).
*'''[[Gaussian units]]''' (classified as a '''non-rationalized''' system of electromagnetism units).
Of these, Lorentz–Heaviside is somewhat more common,&lt;ref name="GreinerNeise1995"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Walter Greiner|author2=Ludwig Neise|author3=Horst Stöcker|title=Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=12DKsFtFTgYC&amp;pg=PA385|year=1995|publisher=Springer-Verlag|isbn=978-0-387-94299-5|page=385}}&lt;/ref&gt; mainly because [[Maxwell's equations]] are simpler in Lorentz–Heaviside units than they are in Gaussian units.

In the two unit systems, the [[elementary charge]] {{math|''e''}} satisfies:
*{{math|''e'' {{=}} {{sqrt|4π''αħc''}}}} (Lorentz–Heaviside),
*{{math|''e'' {{=}} {{sqrt|''αħc''}}}} (Gaussian)
where {{math|''ħ''}} is the [[reduced Planck constant]], {{math|''c''}} is the [[speed of light]], and {{math|''α'' ≈ {{sfrac|137}}}} is the [[fine-structure constant]].

In a natural unit system where {{math|1=[[speed of light|''c'']] = 1}}, Lorentz–Heaviside units can be derived from SI units by setting {{math|1=[[electric constant|''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]] = [[magnetic constant|''μ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]] = 1}}. Gaussian units can be derived from SI units by a more complicated set of transformations, such as multiplying all [[electric field]]s by {{math|(4π''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;−{{frac|2}}&lt;/sup&gt;}}, multiplying all [[magnetic susceptibility|magnetic susceptibilities]] by {{math|4π}}, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Gaussian units#General rules to translate a formula]] and references therein.&lt;/ref&gt;

Planck units are defined by
:{{math|1=''c'' = ''ħ'' = ''G'' = ''k''{{sub|e}} = ''k''{{sub|B}} = 1}},
where {{math|''c''}} is the [[speed of light]], {{math|''ħ''}} is the [[reduced Planck constant]], {{math|''G''}} is the [[gravitational constant]], {{math|''k''{{sub|e}}}} is the [[Coulomb constant]], and {{math|''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[Boltzmann constant]].

Planck units are a system of natural units that is not defined in terms of properties of any prototype, physical object, or even [[elementary particle]]. They only refer to the basic structure of the laws of physics: {{math|''c''}} and {{math|''G''}} are part of the structure of [[spacetime]] in [[general relativity]], and {{math|''ħ''}} captures the relationship between energy and frequency which is at the foundation of [[quantum mechanics]]. This makes Planck units particularly useful and common in theories of [[quantum gravity]], including [[string theory]].

Planck units may be considered "more natural" even than other natural unit systems discussed below, as Planck units are not based on any arbitrarily chosen prototype object or particle. For example, some other systems use the mass of an electron as a parameter to be normalized. But the electron is just one of 16 known massive [[elementary particle]]s, all with different masses, and there is no compelling reason, within fundamental physics, to emphasize the electron mass over some other elementary particle's mass.

The original Planck units are based on [[Gaussian units]], thus &lt;math&gt;G=k_e=1&lt;/math&gt; and thus &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_0=\frac{1}{4 \pi}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mu_0=4 \pi&lt;/math&gt;. However, the Planck units can also based on [[Lorentz–Heaviside units]], thus &lt;math&gt;G=k_e=\frac{1}{4 \pi}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_0=\mu_0=Z_0=1&lt;/math&gt; (this is often called '''reduced Planck units''', e.g. '''reduced [[Planck energy]]'''). Both kinds of Planck units have &lt;math&gt;c=\hbar=k_B=1&lt;/math&gt;.

Stoney units are defined by:
:{{math|1=''c'' = ''G'' = ''k''{{sub|e}} = ''e'' = ''k''{{sub|B}} = 1}},
where {{math|''c''}} is the [[speed of light]], {{math|''G''}} is the [[gravitational constant]], {{math|''k''{{sub|e}}}} is the [[Coulomb constant]], {{math|''e''}} is the [[elementary charge]], and {{math|''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[Boltzmann constant]].

[[George Johnstone Stoney]] was the first physicist to introduce the concept of natural units. He presented the idea in a lecture entitled "On the Physical Units of Nature" delivered to the [[British Association]] in 1874.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Ray | first = T.P. |  year=1981 | title=Stoney's Fundamental Units | journal=Irish Astronomical Journal | volume=15 | page=152|bibcode = 1981IrAJ...15..152R }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stoney units differ from Planck units by fixing the [[elementary charge]] at 1, instead of the [[Planck constant]] (only discovered after Stoney's proposal).

Stoney units are rarely used in modern physics for calculations, but they are of historical interest.

There are two types of atomic units, closely related.

'''Hartree atomic units''':
:{{math|1=''e'' = ''m''{{sub|e}} = ''ħ'' = ''k''{{sub|e}} = ''k''{{sub|B}} = 1}}
:{{math|1=''c'' = {{sfrac|''α''}}}}

:{{math|1=''c'' = {{sfrac|2|''α''}}}}

Coulomb's constant is generally expressed as 
:{{math|1=''k''{{sub|e}} = {{sfrac|4π''ε''{{sub|0}}}}}}.

These units are designed to simplify atomic and molecular physics and chemistry, especially the [[hydrogen atom]], and are widely used in these fields. The Hartree units were first proposed by [[Douglas Hartree]], and are more common than the Rydberg units.

The units are designed especially to characterize the behavior of an electron in the ground state of a hydrogen atom. For example, using the Hartree convention, in the [[Bohr model]] of the hydrogen atom, an electron in the ground state has orbital velocity = 1, orbital radius = 1, angular momentum = 1, [[ionization energy]] = {{sfrac|2}}, etc.

The unit of [[energy]] is called the [[Hartree energy]] in the Hartree system and the [[Rydberg energy]] in the Rydberg system. They differ by a factor of 2. The [[speed of light]] is relatively large in atomic units (137 in Hartree or 274 in Rydberg), which comes from the fact that an electron in hydrogen tends to move much slower than the speed of light. The [[gravitational constant]] is extremely small in atomic units (around 10&lt;sup&gt;−45&lt;/sup&gt;), which comes from the fact that the gravitational force between two electrons is far weaker than the [[Coulomb force]].  The unit length, {{math|''l''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;}}, is the [[Bohr radius]], {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

The values of {{math|''c''}} and {{math|''e''}} shown above imply that {{math|1=''e'' = {{sqrt|''αħc''}}}}, as in [[Gaussian units]], ''not'' [[Lorentz–Heaviside units]].&lt;ref&gt;''Relativistic Quantum Chemistry: The Fundamental Theory of Molecular Science'', by Markus Reiher, Alexander Wolf, p7 [books.google.com/books?id=YwSpxCfsNsEC&amp;pg=PA7 link]&lt;/ref&gt; However, hybrids of the Gaussian and Lorentz–Heaviside units are sometimes used, leading to inconsistent conventions for magnetism-related units.&lt;ref&gt;[http://info.phys.unm.edu/~ideutsch/Classes/Phys531F11/Atomic%20Units.pdf ''A note on units'' lecture notes].

In [[particle physics]] and [[cosmology]], the phrase "natural units" generally means:&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/book/10.1002/9783527617357 ''Gauge field theories: an introduction with applications'', by Guidry, Appendix A]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DT&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=OF4TCxwpcN0C&amp;pg=PA422 ''An introduction to cosmology and particle physics'', by Domínguez-Tenreiro and Quirós, p422]&lt;/ref&gt;
:{{math|1=''ħ'' = ''c'' = ''k''{{sub|B}} = 1}}.
where {{math|''ħ''}} is the [[reduced Planck constant]], {{math|''c''}} is the [[speed of light]], and {{math|''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[Boltzmann constant]].

Both Planck units and QCD units are this type of ''Natural units''.  Like the other systems, the electromagnetism units can be based on either [[Lorentz–Heaviside units]] or [[Gaussian units]]. The unit of charge is different in each.

Finally, one more unit is needed to construct a usable system of units that includes energy and mass. Most commonly, [[electronvolt]] (eV) is used, despite the fact that this is not a "natural" unit in the sense discussed above – it is defined by a natural property, the [[elementary charge]], and the anthropogenic unit of electric potential, the [[volt]]. (The [[SI prefix]]ed multiples of eV are used as well: keV, MeV, GeV, etc.)

With the addition of eV (or any other auxiliary unit with the proper dimension), any quantity can be expressed. For example, a distance of 1.0 [[centimeter|cm]] can be expressed in terms of eV, in natural units, as:&lt;ref name=DT/&gt;
:{{math|1.0 cm {{=}} {{sfrac|1.0 cm|''ħc''}} ≈ 51000 eV{{sup|−1}}}}

===Geometrized units===
{{Main|Geometrized unit system}}

:{{math|1=''c'' = ''G'' = 1}}

The geometrized unit system, used in [[general relativity]], is not a completely defined system.  In this system, the base physical units are chosen so that the [[speed of light]] and the [[gravitational constant]] are set equal to unity. Other units may be treated however desired. Planck units and Stoney units are examples of geometrized unit systems.

==History==
[[Lewis and Clark]] camped at the river's mouth on Nodaway Island on July 8, 1804, by [[Nodaway, Missouri]], on the border of [[Holt County, Missouri]] and [[Andrew County, Missouri]] and took note of the river.

Lewis and Clark liked the spot enough that they recommended it for the winter headquarters of [[Astor Expedition]] of 1810–12 that discovered the [[South Pass (Wyoming)|South Pass]] in Wyoming through which hundreds of settlers on the [[Oregon Trail]], [[California Trail]], [[Mormon Trail]] were to pass.

The river is navigable only by shallow fishing and row boats although steam ships navigated just inside its mouth.  The river was the primary route for white settlers including Amos Graham and Isaac Hogan following the [[Platte Purchase]] of 1836 which opened northwest Missouri for settlement.  Nodaway County, which derives its name from the river, was by far the biggest county in the purchase and the fourth largest in the state of Missouri.

==Description==
Major tributaries in the Nodaway River basin are Seven Mile Creek, West Nodaway River, East Nodaway River, Middle Nodaway River, Clear Creek, Mill Creek, Elkhorn Creek, and [[Arapahoe Creek]]. The biggest town on the river is [[Clarinda, Iowa]].

The Nodaway begins near [[Shambaugh, Iowa]] at the confluence of the East and West Nodaway rivers. The '''West Nodaway River''' rises northeast of [[Massena, Iowa|Massena]] in eastern [[Cass County, Iowa]], and flows {{convert|73.8|mi}}&lt;ref name=NHD/&gt; south-southwest past [[Villisca, Iowa|Villisca]] and [[Clarinda, Iowa|Clarinda]] to its junction with the East Nodaway.  The '''East Nodaway River''' rises just west of [[Orient, Iowa|Orient]] in [[Adair County, Iowa|Adair County]] and flows {{convert|72.8|mi}}&lt;ref name=NHD/&gt; southwest past [[Prescott, Iowa|Prescott]], [[Corning, Iowa|Corning]], [[Brooks, Iowa|Brooks]], and [[Nodaway, Iowa|Nodaway]] to its confluence with the West Nodaway.  The '''Middle Nodaway River''' rises in [[Adair County, Iowa|Adair County]] south of [[Casey, Iowa|Casey]] and flows {{convert|60.5|mi}}&lt;ref name=NHD/&gt; southwest past [[Greenfield, Iowa|Greenfield]], [[Fontanelle, Iowa|Fontanelle]], and [[Carbon, Iowa|Carbon]] to join the West Nodaway just below [[Villisca, Iowa]], {{convert|20.2|mi}}&lt;ref name=NHD/&gt; above the West Nodaway's juncture with the East Nodaway.  The East and West Nodaway join to form the Nodaway River four miles (6&amp;nbsp;km) north of the Iowa-Missouri border, and the river enters Missouri near [[Clearmont, Missouri]].

Elevations in the Nodaway system range from just under {{convert|1400|ft}} above sea level at the source of the Middle Nodaway, to {{convert|950|ft}} at the beginning of the main stem, to {{convert|800|ft}} at its mouth on the Missouri River in [[Nodaway, Missouri]] in [[Andrew County, Missouri]].

The Nodaway River is a [[Strahler Stream Order|sixth order]] river with a basin area of {{convert|1820|sqmi}}.

The [[Platte River (Missouri River)|Platte River]] basin is to the east and the [[Grand River (Missouri)|Grand River]] and [[Des Moines River]] basins to the northeast, with the latter defining the boundary between the Missouri River and Mississippi River basins. The west side is bound by the [[Tarkio River]] basin and in the northwest by the [[Nishnabotna River]] basin.

The Nodaway River basin is prone to extensive flooding and can contribute as much as 20% of the flood crest of the Missouri River near its mouth.

At [[Graham, Missouri]] its normal flow is 1,011 cubic feet per second (28.6 m³/s).  But during the [[Great Flood of 1993]] the river was flowing 78,300&amp;nbsp;ft³/s (2220 m³/s) at Graham.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1980">'''Protozoology''' is the study of [[protozoa]], the "animal-like" (i.e., [[motility|motile]] and [[heterotroph]]ic) [[protists]]. 

This term has become dated as understanding of the evolutionary relationships of the [[eukaryotes]] has improved. For example, the Society of Protozoologists, founded in 1947, was renamed International Society of [[Protistologist]]s in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = New President's Address|url = http://protozoa.uga.edu/artman/publish/article_37.shtml|website = protozoa.uga.edu|accessdate = 2015-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term persists in some cases (e.g., the Polish journal ''Acta Protozoologica'').

'''Romeu Beltrão''' (1913–1977), was a [[Brazil]]ian [[physician]], [[educator]], [[historian]] and [[paleontologist]].  He was born and died in [[Santa Maria, Rio Grande do Sul|Santa Maria]], [[Rio Grande do Sul]], [[Brazil]].&lt;ref name="Beltrao-bio"&gt;[http://w3.ufsm.br/literaturaehistoria/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=83 Biografia de Romeu Beltrão.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

In 1920, at the age of seven, Beltrão entered the [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] ([[secondary school]]) at the College of Santa Maria. At fifteen, went to study at the [[Medical]] School of [[Porto Alegre]]. After graduating in medicine in December 1934, he returned home to Santa Maria. But by February 1935, he had moved to [[São Pedro do Sul, Rio Grande do Sul|São Pedro do Sul]], to practice medicine. While there he courted and married his wife, Nilza Niederauer Alvares, as well as writing opinion pieces for the local newspaper. But he missed the intellectual and cultural life of Santa Maria, so in 1937 he again returned home, where he devoted himself to medicine and teaching. In 1938 he became a Professor of [[Pharmacy|Pharmaceutical]] [[Botany]] at the [[Universidade Federal de Santa Maria]].&lt;ref name="Beltrao-bio" /&gt;

Beltrão was strongly influenced by [[Llewellyn Ivor Price]], and he undertook an intense survey of the [[Paleontology|paleontological]] finds from in and around Santa Maria.  By 1951, he himself was actively engaged in paleontological excavations in the region.&lt;ref name="Beltrao-bio" /&gt; And in 1958, he published the book ''Cronologia Histórica de Santa Maria e do extinto município de São Martinho''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cronologia Histórica de Santa Maria e do extinto município de São Martinho|author=Beltrão, Romeu|publisher= Grafica Editora Pallotti|year=1958|language=Portuguese|oclc=2511003}}; second edition in 1979 {{OCLC|10022858}}&lt;/ref&gt; which included the history of [[paleontology]] in the Paleorrota area from 1787 to 1930. He abandoned his planned second volume which would have brought the history up to about 1960, and instead published his translation of [[Friedrich von Huene|Friedrich von Huene's]] paleontological work about Santa Maria, as well as a biography of Colonel João Niederauer Sobrinho (1827&amp;ndash;1868) a hero of the [[Paraguayan War]].&lt;ref&gt;The book was entitled ''Vanguardeiro de Itororó''&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to write for the local newspaper and compiled a geographical dictionary of the Santa Maria municipality, which was never published.&lt;ref name="Beltrao-bio" /&gt;

== Honors ==
A residential street in [[Canoas]] was named "Rua Romeu Beltrão" in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mapas-rs.com.br/mapa_detalhe.php?id=11&amp;letra=R&amp;mapa=B-10&amp;nome_rua=Romeu%20Beltr%E3o "Mapa de Canoas: Romeu Beltrão"]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ronald Pearson Tripp.jpg|thumbnail|'''Ronald Pearson Tripp''' at his home in Toronto, 1998]]

'''Ronald Pearson Tripp''' (1914–2001) was a British paleontologist specializing in [[trilobites]]. Born in England in 1914, Tripp was self-taught in [[paleontology]], but became an authority on the [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] of the [[trilobite]] families [[Encrinuridae]], [[Lichidae]], and [[Lichakephalidae]] – the latter of which he named.  He wrote the section on the superfamily [[Lichacea]] for the monumental ''[[Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology]]'', which was published in 1959, and wrote numerous articles and monographs pertaining to those families, as well as publications on entire trilobite faunas.  As a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]], Treasurer of the [[Palaeontological Association]], and Associate of the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]], he established many new species and higher [[taxon|taxa]] of trilobites, particularly from the [[Ordovician]] rocks of the [[United Kingdom]], before expanding his research globally.  His wife, Doris, died in 1980, and he later married Phyllis Forrest and moved to Toronto, where he continued his trilobite research as Associate of the [[Royal Ontario Museum]], after having become legally blind.  Tripp died in Toronto, in 2001.  Phyllis died suddenly two months later.

In [[biology]], '''saltation''' (from [[Latin]], ''saltus'', "leap") is a sudden and large [[mutation]]al change from one generation to the next, potentially causing single-step [[speciation]]. This was historically offered as an [[alternative to Darwinism]]. Some forms of [[mutationism]] were effectively saltationist, implying large discontinuous jumps.

Speciation, such as by [[polyploidy]] in plants, can sometimes be achieved in a single and in evolutionary terms sudden step. Evidence is accumulating for various forms of saltation in a variety of organisms.

==History==
{{further|Alternatives to evolution by natural selection}}

Prior to [[Charles Darwin]] most evolutionary scientists had been saltationists.&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Fairfield Osborn]]. (1894). ''From the Greeks to Darwin: An outline of the development of the evolution idea''. New York, London, Macmillan and Co.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] was a gradualist but similar to other scientists of the period had written that saltational evolution was possible. [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] endorsed a theory of saltational evolution that "monstrosities could become the founding fathers (or mothers) of new species by instantaneous transition from one form to the next."&lt;ref&gt;Benedikt Hallgrímsson, Brian K. Hall. (2011). ''Variation: A Central Concept in Biology''. Academic Press. p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Geoffroy wrote that environmental pressures could produce sudden transformations to establish new [[species]] instantaneously.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter J. Bowler]]. (2003). ''Evolution: The History of an Idea''. University of California Press. p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; In 1864 [[Albert von Kölliker]] revived Geoffroy's theory that evolution proceeds by large steps, under the name of [[heterogenesis]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sewall Wright]]. (1984). ''Evolution and the Genetics of Populations: Genetics and Biometric Foundations Volume 1''. University of Chicago Press. p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

With the publication of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' in 1859 Charles Darwin had denied saltational evolution by writing that evolutionary transformation always proceeds gradually and never in jumps. Darwin insisted on slow accumulation of small steps in evolution and wrote "[[natural selection]] acts solely by accumulating slight successive favourable variations, it can produce no great or sudden modification; it can act only by very short steps". Darwin continued in this belief throughout his life.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Darwin]]. (1859). ''On the Origin of Species''. p. 471&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1860 to 1880 saltation had a minority interest but by 1890 had become a major interest to scientists.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Radick. (2008). ''The Simian Tongue: The Long Debate about Animal Language''. University Of Chicago Press. p. 368&lt;/ref&gt; In their paper on evolutionary theories in the 20th century (Levit ''et al''. 2008) wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The advocates of saltationism deny the Darwinian idea of slowly and gradually growing divergence of character as the only source of evolutionary progress. They would not necessarily completely deny gradual variation, but claim that cardinally new ‘body plans’ come into being as a result of saltations (sudden, discontinuous and crucial changes, for example, the series of macromutations). The latter are responsible for the sudden appearance of new higher taxa including classes and orders, while small variation is supposed to be responsible for the fine adaptations below the species level.&lt;ref&gt;Levit, G. S, Meister, K. Hoßfeld, U. (2008). ''Alternative Evolutionary Theories: A Historical Survey''. Journal of Bioeconomics 10.1. pp. 71–96.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the early 20th century a mechanism of saltation was proposed as large [[mutation]]s. It was seen as a much faster alternative to the Darwinian concept of a gradual process of small random variations being acted on by natural selection. It was popular with early geneticists such as [[Hugo de Vries]], who along with [[Carl Correns]] helped rediscover [[Gregor Mendel]]'s laws of inheritance in 1900, [[William Bateson]], a British zoologist who switched to genetics, and early in his career [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]]. Some of these geneticists developed it into the [[mutation theory]] of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Bowler|2003|pp=265–270}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Larson|2004|pp=127–129, 157–167}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also a debate over accounts of the [[evolution]] of [[mimicry]] and if they could be explained by gradualism or saltation. The geneticist [[Reginald Punnett]] supported a saltational theory in his book ''Mimicry in Butterflies'' (1915).&lt;ref&gt;[[Reginald Punnett]]. (1915). [https://archive.org/stream/cu31924003093162#page/n7/mode/2up ''Mimicry in Butterflies'']. Cornell University Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mutation theory of evolution held that species went through periods of rapid mutation, possibly as a result of environmental stress, that could produce multiple mutations, and in some cases completely new species, in a single generation. This mutationist view of evolution was later replaced by the reconciliation of [[Mendelian genetics]] with natural selection into a gradualistic framework for the neo-Darwinian synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter J. Bowler]]. (2003). ''Evolution: The History of an Idea''. University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the emergence of population thinking in evolution which forced many scientists to adopt [[gradualism]] in the early 20th century. According to [[Ernst Mayr]], it wasn't until the development of [[population genetics]] in the neo-Darwinian synthesis in the 1940s that demonstrated the explanatory power of natural selection that saltational views of evolution were largely abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernst Mayr]]. (2007). ''What Makes Biology Unique?: Considerations on the Autonomy of a Scientific Discipline''. Cambridge University Press; 1 edition&lt;/ref&gt;

Saltation was originally denied by the "[[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]]" school of neo-Darwinism which favoured gradual evolution but has since been accepted due to recent evidence in [[evolutionary biology]] (see the [[Saltation (biology)#Current status|current status]] section).&lt;ref&gt;Bateman, R. M. and DiMichele, W. A. (1994). ''Saltational evolution of form in vascular plants: a neoGoldschmidtian synthesis''. In ''Shape and Form in Plants and Fungi'' (eds D. S. Ingram and A. Hudson), Academic Press, London. pp. 61-100.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, T. R. and Hebert, P. D. N. (1999).

''Evolution in Four Dimensions: Genetic, Epigenetic, Behavioral, and Symbolic Variation in the History of Life''. A Bradford Book. {{ISBN|0262600692}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Serres MH, Kerr AR, McCormack TJ, Riley M. (2009). [http://www.biologydirect.com/content/4/1/46 ''Evolution by leaps: gene duplication in bacteria'']. Biology Direct 4: 46.&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years there are some prominent proponents of saltation, including [[Carl Woese]]. Woese, and colleagues, suggested that the absence of RNA signature continuum between [[domain (biology)|domains]] of [[bacteria]], [[archaea]], and [[eukarya]] constitutes a primary indication that the three primary organismal lineages materialized via one or more major evolutionary saltations from some universal ancestral state involving dramatic change in cellular organization that was significant early in the evolution of life, but in complex organisms gave way to the generally accepted Darwinian mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, E., A. Sethi, J. Montoya, C.R. Woese and Z. Luthey-Schulten. (2008). [http://www.pnas.org/content/105/37/13953.full?sid=f3651397-00e9-4a57-802b-f41c6ef6cf5a ''Molecular signatures of ribosomal evolution'']. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 105: 13953–13958.&lt;/ref&gt; The geneticist [[Barbara McClintock]] introduced the idea of "[[Transposable element|jumping genes]]", chromosome transpositions that can produce rapid changes in the [[genome]].&lt;ref&gt;McClintock, B. (1984). ''The significance of responses of the genome to challenge''. Science Vol. 226, pp. 792-801.&lt;/ref&gt;

Saltational [[speciation]], also known as abrupt speciation, is the discontinuity in a lineage that occurs through genetic mutations, [[Chromosome abnormality|chromosomal aberrations]] or other evolutionary mechanisms that cause reproductively isolated individuals to establish a new species population. [[Polyploid]]y, karyotypic fission, [[symbiogenesis]] and [[Horizontal gene transfer|lateral gene transfer]] are possible mechanisms for saltational speciation.&lt;ref&gt;Oladele Ogunseitan. (2004). ''Microbial Diversity: Form and Function in Prokaryotes''. Wiley-Blackwell. p. 13. {{ISBN|978-0632047086}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Macromutation theory==
{{further|Mutationism}}

The botanist [[John Christopher Willis]] proposed an early saltationist theory of evolution. He held that species were formed by large mutations, not gradual evolution by natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;J. C. Willis. (1923). ''The Origin of Species by Large, rather than by Gradual, Change, and by Guppy's Method of Differentiation''. Annals of Botany. Vol. 37, No. 148. pp. 605-628.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. M. Beal. (1941). ''The Course of Evolution by J. C. Willis''. Botanical Gazette, Vol. 102, No. 3. p. 638.&lt;/ref&gt;

The German geneticist [[Richard Goldschmidt]] was the first scientist to use the term "hopeful monster". Goldschmidt thought that small gradual changes could not bridge the hypothetical divide between microevolution and macroevolution. In his book ''The Material Basis of Evolution'' (1940) he wrote "the change from species to species is not a change involving more and more additional atomistic changes, but a complete change of the primary pattern or reaction system into a new one, which afterwards may again produce intraspecific variation by micromutation." Goldschmidt believed the large changes in evolution were caused by macromutations (large mutations). His ideas about macromutations became known as the hopeful monster hypothesis which is considered a type of saltational evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Verne Grant. (1963). ''The Origin of Adaptations''. Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldschmidt's thesis however was universally rejected and widely ridiculed within the biological community, which favored the [[neo-Darwinism|neo-Darwinian]] explanations of [[Ronald Fisher|R.A. Fisher]], [[J. B. S. Haldane]] and [[Sewall Wright]].&lt;ref&gt;Gould, S. J. (1982). "The uses of heresey; an introduction to Richard Goldschmidt's ''The Material Basis of Evolution''." [https://books.google.com/books?id=kAPLvAnp7KAC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PR13 pp. xiii-xlii]. New Haven: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there has been a recent interest in the ideas of Goldschmidt in the field of [[evolutionary developmental biology]] as some scientists are convinced he was not entirely wrong.&lt;ref&gt;Scott F. Gilbert. (2000). ''Developmental Biology'' Sinauer Associates; 6th edition. {{ISBN|0878932437}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Otto Schindewolf]], a German paleontologist, also supported macromutations as part of his evolutionary theory. He was known for presenting an alternative interpretation of the fossil record based on his ideas of [[orthogenesis]], saltational evolution and extraterrestrial impacts opposed to gradualism but abandoned the view of macromutations in later publications.&lt;ref&gt;[[Otto Schindewolf]]. (1969). ''Über den “Typus” in morphologischer und phylogenetischer Biologie''. Mainz: Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Søren Løvtrup]], a [[biochemist]] and [[embryologist]] from Denmark, advocated a similar hypothesis of macromutation to Goldschmidt's in 1974.&lt;ref name="Kathryn"&gt;Kathryn E. Hood, Carolyn Tucker Halpern and Gary Greenberg. (2010). ''Handbook of Developmental Science, Behavior, and Genetics''. Wiley-Blackwell. p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; Lovtrup believed that macromutations interfered with various [[epigenetic]] processes, that is, those which affect the causal processes in biological development. This is in contrast to the gradualistic theory of micromutations of [[Neo-Darwinism]], which claims that evolutionary innovations are generally the result of accumulation of numerous very slight modifications. Lovtrup also rejected the [[punctuated equilibrium|punctuated equilibria]] of [[Stephen Jay Gould|Stephen Gould]] and [[Niles Eldredge]], claiming it was a form of gradualism and not a macromutation theory. Lovtrup defended many of Darwin's critics including Schindewolf, [[St. George Jackson Mivart|Mivart]], Goldschmidt, and Himmelfarb.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2O7iz2mGeSkC&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=soren+lovtrup&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=UcfRTZfoDMyVswbArJC4CQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-preview-link&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC4QuwUwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=soren%20lovtrup&amp;f=false Review of Lovtrup's book in the New Scientist, Oct 15, 1988]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mae Wan Ho]] described Lovtrup's theory as similar to the hopeful monster theory of [[Richard Goldschmidt]].&lt;ref name="Kathryn" /&gt;

Goldschmidt presented two mechanisms for how hopeful monsters might work. One mechanism, involved “systemic mutations”, rejected the classical [[gene]] concept and is no longer considered by modern science; however, his second mechanism involved “developmental macromutations” in “rate genes” or “controlling genes” that change early development and thus cause large effects in the adult phenotype. These kind of mutations are similar to the ones considered in contemporary [[evolutionary developmental biology]].&lt;ref&gt;Guenter Theissen. (2010). [http://www.palaeodiversity.org/pdf/03Suppl/Supplement_Theissen.pdf ''Homeosis of the angiosperm flower: Studies on three candidate cases of saltational evolution'']. Palaeodiversity 3, Supplement: 131-139.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the subject of Goldschmidt [[Donald Prothero]] in his book ''Evolution: What the Fossils Say and Why It Matters'' (2007) wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The past twenty years have vindicated Goldschmidt to some degree. With the discovery of the importance of regulatory genes, we realize that he was ahead of his time in focusing on the importance of a few genes controlling big changes in the organisms, not small-scales changes in the entire genome as neo-Darwinians thought. In addition, the hopeful monster problem is not so insurmountable after all. Embryology has shown that if you affect an entire population of developing embryos with a stress (such as a heat shock) it can cause many embryos to go through the same new pathway of embryonic development, and then they all become hopeful monsters when they reach reproductive age.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Prothero]]. (2007). ''Evolution: What the Fossils Say and Why It Matters''. Columbia University Press. p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2008 evolutionary biologist [[Olivia Judson]] in her article ''The Monster Is Back, and It’s Hopeful'' listed some examples which may support the hopeful monster hypothesis&lt;ref&gt;[[Olivia Judson]]. (2008). [http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/22/the-monster-is-back-and-its-hopeful/ ''The Monster Is Back, and It’s Hopeful'']. The New York Times.&lt;/ref&gt; and an article published in the journal [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] in 2010 titled ''Evolution: Revenge of the Hopeful Monster'' reported that studies in stickleback populations in a British Columbia lake and [[bacteria]] populations in a Michigan lab have shown that large individual genetic changes can have vast effects on organisms "without dooming it to the evolutionary rubbish heap". According to the article "Single-gene changes that confer a large adaptive value do happen: they are not rare, they are not doomed and, when competing with small-effect mutations, they tend to win. But small-effect mutations still matter — a lot. They provide essential fine-tuning and sometimes pave the way for explosive evolution to follow."&lt;ref&gt;Tanguy Chouard. (2010). [http://www.nature.com/news/2010/100217/full/463864a.html ''Evolution: Revenge of the hopeful monster'']. Nature 463, 864-867.&lt;/ref&gt;

A paper by (Page ''et al.'' 2010) have written that the Mexican [[axolotl]] (''Ambystoma mexicanum'') could be classified as a hopeful monster as it exhibits an adaptive and derived mode of development that has evolved rapidly and independently among tiger salamanders. According to the paper there has been an interest in aspects of the hopeful monster hypothesis in recent years:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Goldschmidt proposed that [[mutation]]s occasionally yield individuals within populations that deviate radically from the norm and referred to such individuals as "hopeful monsters". If the novel phenotypes of hopeful monsters arise under the right environmental circumstances, they may become fixed, and the population will found a new species. While this idea was discounted during the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|Modern synthesis]], aspects of the hopeful monster hypothesis have been substantiated in recent years. For example, it is clear that dramatic changes in phenotype can occur from few mutations of key developmental genes and phenotypic differences among species often map to relatively few [[genetics|genetic]] factors. These findings are motivating renewed interest in the study of hopeful monsters and the perspectives they can provide about the evolution of development. In contrast to mutants that are created in the lab, hopeful monsters have been shaped by [[natural selection]] and are therefore more likely to reveal mechanisms of adaptive evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Robert B. Page, Meredith A. Boley, Jeramiah J. Smith, Srikrishna Putta and Stephen R. Voss. (2010).

BMC Evolutionary Biology, 10:199.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Günter Theißen]], a German professor of [[genetics]], has classified [[Homeosis|homeotic]] mutants as hopeful monsters and documented many examples of animal and plant lineages that may have originated as hopeful monsters.&lt;ref&gt;Guenter Theissen. (2006). [http://evolocus.com/Publications/Theissen2006.pdf ''The proper place of hopeful monsters in evolutionary biology'']. Theory in Biosciences, 124: 349–369.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hintz, M.; Bartholmes, C.; Nutt, P.; Ziermann, J.; Hameister, S.; Neuffer, B.; Theissen, G. (2006).

Journal of Experimental Botany, 57: 3531-3542.&lt;/ref&gt; American biologist Michael Freeling has proposed "balanced gene drive" as a saltational mechanism in the mutationist tradition, which could explain trends involving morphological complexity in plant and animal [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] lineages.&lt;ref&gt;Freeling M, Thomas BC. (2006). ''Gene-balanced duplications, like tetraploidy, provide predictable drive to increase morphological complexity''. Genome Res. 16: 805-814. Freeling M. (2009).

===Known mechanisms===

Examples of saltational evolution include cases of stabilized hybrids that can reproduce without crossing (such as [[allotetraploid]]s) and cases of [[symbiogenesis]]. Both [[gene duplication]] and [[Horizontal gene transfer|lateral gene transfer]] have the capacity to bring about relatively large changes that are saltational.&lt;ref&gt;Serres MH, Kerr AR, McCormack TJ, Riley M.

===Explanations===

Reviewing the history of macroevolutionary theories, the American evolutionary biologist [[Douglas J. Futuyma]] notes that since 1970, two very different alternatives to Darwinian gradualism have been proposed, both by [[Stephen Jay Gould]]: mutationism, and [[punctuated equilibria]].&lt;ref name=Futuyma/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Jay Gould|Gould, S. J.]] (1980) Is a new and general theory of evolution emerging? Paleobiology 6:119–130&lt;/ref&gt; Gould's macromutation theory gave a nod to his predecessor with an envisaged "Goldschmidt break" between evolution within a species and speciation.

'''Solrad 9''', also known '''Explorer 37''' and '''Explorer SE-B''', was one of the SOLRAD (Solar Radiation) program that began in 1960 to provide continuous coverage of solar radiation with a set of standard photometers. 

==Launch and Operations==
Was launched on March 5, 1968 from [[Wallops Flight Facility]], [[Virginia]], [[United States]], with [[Scout rocket|Scout]] launch vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lib.cas.cz/space.40/1968/017A.HTM|title=1968-017A - Explorer 37|work=Space 40|first=Antonín|last=Vítek|language=Czech|date=7 December 2004|accessdate=17 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solrad 9 was a spin stabilized satellite oriented with its spin axis [[perpendicular]] to the sun-satellite line so that the 14 solar [[X-ray]] and [[UV]] [[photometers]] pointing radially outward from its [[equatorial belt]] viewed the sun with each revolution. Data were simultaneously transmitted via [[Frequency modulation|FM]]/[[Amplitude modulation|AM]] [[telemetry]] and recorded in a core memory that read out its contents on command. Individual scientists and institutions were invited to receive and use the data transmitted on the 136 MHz telemetry band on the standard IRIG channels three through eight.&lt;ref name="nssdc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nrc"&gt;{{cite web|title= United States Space Science Program: Report to COSPAR|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=yGMrAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=United+States+Space+Science+Program:+Report+to+COSPAR+1969&amp;hl=it&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|work=National Academies, 1969, p. 27|publisher= National Research Council. Space Science Board, [[COSPAR]]|accessdate=17 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the time that elapsed between the termination of [[Solrad 8]] operations in August 1967 and the orbiting of Solrad 9, solar activity data were obtained using photometers in satellites [[OSO-4]] and [[OGO-4]].

Solrad 9 was particularly important among the Solrad series satellites because thanks to the collected data were useful to predict the behavior of the sun during the period of the first manned missions of the [[Apollo Program]], starting from the first, [[Apollo 7]], it is therefore useful to draw up a mission program to ensure, from this point of view, the safety of [[astronaut]]s.&lt;ref name="nrc"/&gt;

As of July 1971, it was decided to use the [[Solrad 10]] memory data, put into orbit on the 8th of the same month, and so continued until June 1973, when the [[Solrad 10]] data storage device had a bad operation and [[NASA]] began to read data from the memory of Solrad 9. The satellite remained active until February 25, 1974, when the gas reserves useful to maintain control of the facility were over. Once the stability was lost, in fact, the satellite became useless and therefore was turned off. 

Unlike [[Solrad 8]], its predecessor, Solrad 9, did not remain in orbit and returned to the [[atmosphere]], disintegrating on November 16, 1990.&lt;ref name="nssdc"/&gt;

The '''Space Telescope – European Coordinating Facility''' (ST-ECF) was an institution which provided a number of support and service functions primarily for European observers of the NASA/ESA [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST). It was established in 1984 by the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) and the [[European Southern Observatory]] (ESO), and was located at the ESO headquarters in [[Garching bei München]], [[Germany]]. The ST-ECF ceased operations on 31 December 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stecf.org&lt;/ref&gt;

The ST-ECF provided detailed technical information about the HST and its science instruments, supported European astronomers who were preparing HST observing proposals and coordinated the development of computer software tuned to the specific data analysis needs of HST users. In all these duties the ST-ECF staff maintained close contacts with the [[STScI|Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI)]] in [[Baltimore]], which is charged with the scientific operation of the HST observatory.

The ST-ECF was last headed by [[Robert Fosbury|Robert (Bob) Fosbury]]. Deputy was [[Jeremy Walsh (astronomer)|Jeremy Walsh]].

==User support==
[[File:Cartwheel Galaxy.jpg|thumb|This view of the [[Cartwheel Galaxy]] was produced by ST-ECF from Hubble data, and released in December 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/potw1036a/]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Founded before the era of the internet and widely available computer resources the ST-ECF was founded with user support for European astronomers as the main goal.
When internet connections across the Atlantic and powerful computers became the mainstay, the focus of the organization shifted towards data product and dedicated instrument science support.

==Instrument science==
The ST-ECF was actively engaged in software development in many areas related to HST data calibration, analysis and visualisation for especially the Hubble instruments [[Faint Object Spectrograph]], [[STIS]], and [[Advanced Camera for Surveys]]. For example:

* [[aXe Spectral Extraction|aXe]] – Slitless Spectroscopy Extraction software
* [[SLIM]]: A Slitless Spectroscopy Simulator for ACS
* [[Faint Object Spectrograph]] [[POA CALFOS|Post Operational Archives calibration pipeline]] (included in [[STSDAS]], done by the [[Instrument Physical Modeling Group]])
* The [[STIS]] Spectrograph calibration enhancement project (done by the [[Instrument Physical Modeling Group]])
* [[NICMOSlook]] and [[Calnic C]]
* [[Lucy-Hook coaddition method]]

==Science archive==
Together with the [[European Southern Observatory|European Southern Observatory (ESO)]]
the ST-ECF operated and maintained the [[ESO/ST-ECF Science Archive Facility]] from where  all the scientific data collected by the  [[Hubble Space Telescope]] could be accessed by the public.
In collaboration with the HST archives at the [[STScI]] and the [[Canadian Astronomy Data Centre]] (CADC) data products and access methods were continuously improved to assure the best possible science data for astronomers around the world. This includes work on the Virtual Observatory, [[On-The-Fly Calibration]], and [[Association (astronomy)|B Associations]]. Earlier work pioneered projects like [[Astrovirtel]] and [[Astrophysical Virtual Observatory]].

After the closure of ST-ECF the European HST Archive were moved to [[European Space Agency|ESA's]] [[European Space Astronomy Centre]] in Spain, where most of ESA's Space Science Archives are located and operated from.

==Public outreach and education==
One of the groups at the ST-ECF was the [[Hubble European Space Agency Information Centre]] (HEIC), which, since 1999, has been the leading Hubble outreach activities group in Europe (headed by the science communication specialist [[Lars Lindberg Christensen]] and graphic designer [[Martin Kornmesser]]). HEIC's mission statement is to fulfill the Hubble Space Telescope outreach and education tasks for the [[European Space Agency]].

HEIC became a very distinguished communication office of experts using the newest software and techniques. After the closure of ST-ECF the Outreach component continued on an ESO contract for ESA, as part of ESO's Education and Public Outreach department.

The ESA/Hubble office has produced large amounts of astronomical material – press releases, images, brochures, web pages, books etc. –  suitable both for educational purposes and wider public consumption. HEIC provided a well-assorted archive that is publicly available on its web page.

The work is centred on the production of news and photo releases that highlight interesting Hubble science results and images. These are often European in origin, and so not only increase the awareness of [[European Space Agency]]’s Hubble share (15%), but the contribution of European scientists to the observatory. Furthermore the group produces video releases, innovative educational material, CD-ROMs, brochures, posters, as well as DVDs and museum information kiosks, and much more.

All publicised material can be found on [http://www.spacetelescope.org/ spacetelescope.org]. The group is home to the [[FITS Liberator]] project and the "Hubble – 15 Years of Discovery" project that also led to the book [[Hubble - 15 Years of Discovery]].

'''Spirit Mound Historic Prairie''' is a [[state park]] of [[South Dakota]], USA, featuring a prominent hill on the [[Great Plains]].  The [[Plains Indians]] of the region considered Spirit Mound the home of dangerous spirits or [[little people (mythology)|little people]]; members of the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] climbed it on August 25, 1804.  The park was established in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Sapp, Methea; Enright, Kelly; Nichols, Terri; Ney, Jason; and Dreese, Donelle N. ''America's Natural Places.''

Due to extensive damming of the [[Missouri River]], Spirit Mound is one of the few places which historians can identify as a precise spot upon which Lewis and Clark stood .&lt;ref&gt;Fanselow, Julie. ''Traveling the Lewis and Clark Trail.'' Guilford, Conn.: Falcon Guides, 2007, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

==About the park==
Spirit Mound was in private hands for many decades, leading to extensive degradation of the site's original status.&lt;ref&gt;[http://siouxcityjournal.com/news/local/a1/article_e667ac40-d944-5df8-8f28-1d046a78bca6.html Sioux City Journal], "''Is Spirit Mound shrinking?''," by Michele Linck (November 7th, 2010 - retrieved on November 6th, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;  White settlers first came to the area in 1868, and used it for grazing livestock and for farming.&lt;ref name="News2005"&gt;[http://www.spiritmound.com/Newsletters/2003.pdf Wilson, Norma C. "Grass Dance Special for Spirit Mound." ''Spirit Mound Trust News.'' 2005.]&lt;/ref&gt; Five separate landowners owned parts of the site in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name="News2003"&gt;[http://www.spiritmound.com/Newsletters/2003.pdf "In the Footsteps of Lewis and Clark." ''Lewis and Clark - Spirit Mound Trust News.'' 2003.]&lt;/ref&gt; More than 20 buildings, a feed lot, soybean fields, corn fields, several roads, 1,500 non-native trees, and {{convert|5|mi|km}} of fence dotted the site.&lt;ref name="News2003" /&gt;

Several local citizens formed the Spirit Mound Trust in 1986 in an attempt to preserve the site.&lt;ref name="News2003" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harriman, Peter. "Federal Money Boosts Spirit Mound." ''Sioux Falls Argus Leader.'' April 22, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The group received funding boosts and publicity with the 1996 publication of the book ''[[Undaunted Courage]]'' (about the Lewis and Clark Expedition) and the 1997 [[Ken Burns]] documentary ''[[Lewis &amp; Clark: The Journey of the Corps of Discovery]]''.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;[http://www.spiritmound.com/historyofthetrust.htm "Spirit Mound Trust History." No date.] Accessed 2010-09-02.&lt;/ref&gt; After years of lobbying, the federal government's [[Land and Water Conservation Fund]] provided $600,000 to acquire the site.&lt;ref&gt;"Lewis and Clark Exploration Site Gets Federal Money for Restoration." ''[[Associated Press]].'' October 21, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; The donation required that State of South Dakota establish the site as a state park, while the Spirit Mound Trust would restore it, provide interpretational signage and tours, and raise $500,000 for the site's long-term preservation.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; The {{convert|320|acre|ha|adj=on}} site was purchased from the private landowners in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;"Spirit Mound Land Has Been Purchased." ''Associated Press.'' April 21, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; On July 29, 2001, [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Tim Johnson (U.S. Senator)|Tim Johnson]] presented a symbolic check for $600,000 for the purchase of Spirit Mound and the surrounding land.&lt;ref&gt;Morast, Robert. "Ceremony Marks Purchase by State." ''Sioux Falls Argus Leader.'' July 30, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 the [[United States Department of the Interior]] designated the trail leading to the summit of Spirit Mound as a [[National Recreation Trail]].&lt;ref name="News2004"&gt;[http://www.spiritmound.com/Newsletters/2003.pdf Heisinger, Jim. "National Designation for Spirit Mound Summit Trail." ''Spirit Mound Trust News.'' 2004.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Spirit Mound Creek]] runs right past the Mound, on its southern side.&lt;ref&gt;''Aliens in American History:  Book I - Spirit Mound'', by John Clark Craig and E.J. Thornton, Phenomenon Publishing, 2011 (page 50).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some controversy has surrounded the establishment of the state park. In 2001 a few local Native American leaders expressed dismay that a site sacred and terrifying to local tribes would be treated as a "fun" place to visit.&lt;ref&gt;"Some American Indians Not Pleased With Plans for Spiritual Site." ''Associated Press.'' April 6, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2319">In [[particle physics]], a '''stop squark''', symbol {{SubatomicParticle|top squark}}, is the [[superpartner]] of the [[top quark]] as predicted by [[supersymmetry]] (SUSY).  It is a [[sfermion]], which means it is a spin-0 [[boson]] ([[scalar boson]]).  While the top quark is the heaviest known quark, the stop [[squark]] is actually often the lightest squark in many supersymmetry models.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-cdf.fnal.gov/physics/new/top/2008/tprop/Stop/Dilepton_Stop_Quark_Search_2Point7invfb.html Search For Pair Production of Stop Quarks Mimicking Top Event Signatures&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The stop squark is a key ingredient of a wide range of SUSY models  that address the [[hierarchy problem]] of the [[Standard Model]] (SM) in a [[naturalness (physics)|natural]] way. A boson partner to the top quark would stabilize the [[Higgs boson]] mass against quadratically divergent quantum corrections, provided its mass is close to the electroweak symmetry breaking energy scale. If this was the case then the stop squark would be accessible at the [[Large Hadron Collider]]. In the generic [[R-parity]] conserving [[Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model]] (MSSM) the scalar partners of right-handed and left-handed top quarks mix to form two stop mass eigenstates. Depending on the specific details of the SUSY model and the mass hierarchy of the sparticles, the stop might decay into a [[bottom quark]] and a [[chargino]], with a subsequent decay of the chargino into the lightest [[neutralino]] (which is often the [[lightest supersymmetric particle]]).

Many searches for evidence of the stop squark have been performed by both the [[ATLAS experiment|ATLAS]] and [[Compact Muon Solenoid|CMS]] experiments at the LHC but so far no signal has been discovered. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/AtlasPublic/SupersymmetryPublicResults|title=ATLAS Supersymmetry Public Results| publisher=ATLAS, CERN |date= |accessdate=2014-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/PhysicsResultsSUS|title=CMS Supersymmetry Public Results| publisher=CMS, CERN |date= |accessdate=2014-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Sulfobacillus''''' is a [[genus (biology)|genus]] of [[bacteria]] containing five named [[species (biology)|species]]. Members of the genus are [[Gram-positive]], [[acidophilic]], [[sporulation|spore-forming]] bacteria that are moderately [[thermophilic]] or thermotolerant. All species are [[facultative anaerobes]] capable of [[oxidizing]] [[sulfur]]-containing compounds; they differ in optimal growth temperature and metabolic capacity, particularly in their ability to grow on various [[organic compound|organic carbon compounds]].&lt;ref name="justice_2014"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Justice |first1=Nicholas B |last2=Norman |first2=Anders |last3=Brown |first3=Christopher T |last4=Singh |first4=Andrea |last5=Thomas |first5=Brian C |last6=Banfield |first6=Jillian F |title=Comparison of environmental and isolate Sulfobacillus genomes reveals diverse carbon, sulfur, nitrogen, and hydrogen metabolisms |journal=BMC Genomics |date=2014 |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=1107 |doi=10.1186/1471-2164-15-1107}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guo_2014"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Guo |first1=Xue |last2=Yin |first2=Huaqun |last3=Liang |first3=Yili |last4=Hu |first4=Qi |last5=Zhou |first5=Xishu |last6=Xiao |first6=Yunhua |last7=Ma |first7=Liyuan |last8=Zhang |first8=Xian |last9=Qiu |first9=Guanzhou |last10=Liu |first10=Xueduan |last11=Mormile |first11=Melanie R. |title=Comparative Genome Analysis Reveals Metabolic Versatility and Environmental Adaptations of Sulfobacillus thermosulfidooxidans Strain ST |journal=PLoS ONE |date=18 June 2014 |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=e99417 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0099417}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zhang_2017"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zhang |first1=Xian |last2=Liu |first2=Xueduan |last3=Liang |first3=Yili |last4=Guo |first4=Xue |last5=Xiao |first5=Yunhua |last6=Ma |first6=Liyuan |last7=Miao |first7=Bo |last8=Liu |first8=Hongwei |last9=Peng |first9=Deliang |last10=Huang |first10=Wenkun |last11=Zhang |first11=Yuguang |last12=Yin |first12=Huaqun |last13=Drake |first13=Harold L. |title=Adaptive Evolution of Extreme Acidophile Sulfobacillus thermosulfidooxidans Potentially Driven by Horizontal Gene Transfer and Gene Loss |journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology |date=1 April 2017 |volume=83 |issue=7 |doi=10.1128/AEM.03098-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dopson_2016"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dopson |first1=Mark |editor1-last=Quatrini |editor1-first=Raquel |title=Acidophiles : life in extremely acidic environments |date=2016 |publisher=Caister Academic Press |isbn=1910190349 |pages=79-91 |chapter=Physiological and Phylogenetic Diversity of Acidophilic Bacteria}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxonomy==
''Sulfobacillus'' was first described in 1978, along with the [[type species]], ''[[Sulfobacillus thermosulfidooxidans]]''.&lt;ref name="golovacheva_1978"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Golovacheva |first1=RS |last2=Karavaĭko |first2=GI |title=[Sulfobacillus, a new genus of thermophilic sporulating bacteria]. |journal=Mikrobiologiia |date=1978 |volume=47 |issue=5 |pages=815-22 |pmid=101742}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lpsn"&gt;{{cite web |title=Genus Sulfobacillus |url=http://www.bacterio.net/sulfobacillus.html |website=List of Prokaryotic Names with Standing in Nomenclature |accessdate=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four additional species have since been described, in at least one case discovered after samples believed to be ''S. thermosulfidooxidans'' showed unexpected characteristics.&lt;ref name="norris_1996"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Norris |first1=P. R. |last2=Clark |first2=D. A. |last3=Owen |first3=J.

The genus is of uncertain taxonomic position. It was originally placed in the [[Clostridiales]]. It is likely related to the genus ''[[Thermaerobacter]]'' and may represent either a deep branch of the ''[[Firmicutes]]'' or a separate [[phylum]].&lt;ref name=guo_2014 /&gt;&lt;ref name=lpsn /&gt;&lt;ref name="bergeys"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ludwig |first1=Wolfgang |last2=Schleifer |first2=Karl-Heinz |last3=Whitman |first3=William B. |editor1-last=Vos |editor1-first=Paul |editor2-last=Garrity |editor2-first=George |editor3-last=Jones |editor3-first=Dorothy |editor4-last=Krieg |editor4-first=Noel R. |editor5-last=Ludwig |editor5-first=Wolfgang |editor6-last=Rainey |editor6-first=Fred A. |editor7-last=Schleifer |editor7-first=Karl-Heinz |editor8-last=Whitman |editor8-first=William B. |title=Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology Volume 3: The Firmicutes |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-387-95041-9 |edition=2nd |chapter=Revised road map to the phylum Firmicutes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==
''Sulfobacillus'' species are found globally in both natural and artificial [[acidic]] environments, such as [[hot spring]]s, [[solfatara]] environments, [[hydrothermal vent]]s, and in various forms of [[acid mine drainage]]. Compared to other bacterial species found in similar acidic environments, ''Sulfobacillus'' species are often present at relatively low abundance.&lt;ref name=justice_2014 /&gt;

==Genome==
The [[genome]]s of several ''Sulfobacillus'' species have been [[DNA sequencing|sequenced]].&lt;ref name=justice_2014 /&gt;&lt;ref name=guo_2014 /&gt;&lt;ref name=zhang_2017 /&gt; Differences between members include genome size and gene content related to sulfur oxidation pathways.&lt;ref name=justice_2014 /&gt;

The School of Chemistry is an academic unit of the [[University of Edinburgh]], in [[Scotland]], The research rating of the 2008 [[Research Assessment Exercise|RAE]] was one of the highest in the UK.&lt;ref name=RAE2008&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/education/table/2008/dec/18/rae-2008-chemistry RAE 2008: chemistry results]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The teaching of Chemistry at Edinburgh began in 1713 when James Crawford was appointed to the Chair of Physics and Chemistry. The department has occupied many sites in its history, from a house at the top of Robertson's Close in the city centre, to purpose-built facilities in the central campus at [[Old College, University of Edinburgh|Old College]] through to its current location at [[King's Buildings]]. Each move has brought with it expansions in size and status until the department occupied the position it does now, as one of the world's leading Chemistry [[teaching]] and [[research]] establishments.{{cn|date=May 2015}}

Today the department carries on the traditions of Chemistry at Edinburgh both in teaching and research.{{cn|date=May 2015}} The collaborative research School formed with [[St Andrews University|St Andrews]] Chemistry department to form EaStCHEM has strengthened research in Scotland in the chemical sciences.{{cn|date=May 2015}}

==Current==
The school has a research staff of approximately 120 individuals, and an academic staff of over 40. Current annual enrollment includes around 200 research students, and 450 taught [[postgraduate]] and [[undergraduate]] students.

EaStCHEM is the joint research school in chemistry between the Universities of Edinburgh and St Andrews. It has eight research groupings: Chemical Biology; Synthesis; Materials; Structural Chemistry; Chemical Physics; Biophysical Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; and Catalysis.

In the Research Assessment Exercise (RAE) 2008, the most in-depth analysis of research outputs for seven years, EaStCHEM, submitted 73% of all world leading outputs (4*) in Scotland and 12% of world leading outputs in all of the UK. From 31 submissions EastChem was the largest in [[United Kingdom|UK]] Chemistry. EaStCHEM comes joint 4th in the [[Grade Point Average]] (GPA) metric, and first when staff numbers are factored in (the power ranking).{{cn|date=May 2015}}

=== Research Themes ===
The School has four major research themes as part of EaStCHEM:

The Chemistry/Biology Interface area is broad, with particular strengths in the areas of [[protein structure]] and [[Protein function|function]], mechanistic [[enzymology]], [[proteomics]], biologically targeted synthesis, the application of high throughput and combinatorial approaches and [[biophysical chemistry]], which focuses on the development and application of [[physical chemistry|physicochemical]] techniques to [[biological system]]s.

Chemical Physics/Physical Chemistry is the fundamental study of molecular properties and processes. Areas of expertise include probing [[molecular structure]] in the [[gas phase]], clusters and nanoparticles, the development and application of physicochemical techniques such as [[mass spectrometry]] to molecular systems and the EaStCHEM surface science group, who study complex molecules on surfaces, probing the structure property-relationships employed in [[heterogeneous catalysis]]. A major feature is In Silico Scotland, a world class{{cn|date=May 2015}} research computing facility.

Molecular Synthesis encompasses the synthesis and characterisation at ambient and extreme conditions of organic and inorganic compounds, including those with application in homogeneous catalysis, [[nanotechnology]], [[supramolecular chemistry]], [[drug discovery]] and [[ligand design]]. The development of innovative synthetic and characterisation methodologies (particularly in structural chemistry) is a key feature.

The Materials Chemistry group is one of the largest materials chemistry groups in the UK. Areas of strength include the design, synthesis and characterisation of strongly correlated electronic materials, [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] and [[fuel cell]] materials and devices, porous solids, materials at extreme pressures and temperatures, polymer microarray technologies and technique development for materials and [[nanomaterials]] analysis.
