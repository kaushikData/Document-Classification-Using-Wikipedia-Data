{{Other uses|Abaris (mythology)}}

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Abaris the Hyperborean''' ([[Ancient Greek]]: Ἄβαρις Ὑπερβόρειος ''Abaris Hyperboreios''), son of Seuthes, was a legendary sage, [[Iatromantis|healer]], and priest of [[Apollo]] known to the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]]. He was supposed to have learned his skills in his homeland of [[Hyperborea]], which he fled during a plague. He was said to be endowed with the gift of prophecy, and by this as well as by his [[Scythians|Scythian]] dress and simplicity and honesty he created great sensation in Greece, and was held in high esteem.&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]]. ''[[Geographica (Strabo)|Geographica]],'' ''[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Strab.+7.3.8&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0198:book=7:chapter=3&amp;highlight=Abaris 7.3.8.]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legend==
According to [[Herodotus]] he was said to have traveled around the world with an arrow&lt;ref&gt;"Hence the dart of Abaris" (''[[Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable]]'')&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Nonnus]]. ''[[Dionysiaca]], [https://topostext.org/work/529#11.113 11.132]''&lt;/ref&gt; symbolizing [[Apollo]], eating no food.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]]. ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]],'' ''[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+4.36&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126 4.36.1-2]''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heraclides Ponticus]] wrote that Abaris flew on it. [[Plato]] (''[[Charmides (dialogue)|Charmides]]'' 158C) classes him amongst the "[[Thracians|Thracian]] physicians" who practice medicine upon the soul as well as the body by means of "incantations" (''epodai''). A temple to [[Persephone]] at [[Sparta]] was attributed to Abaris by [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] (9.10).  Alan H. Griffiths compares Abaris to [[Aristeas]] in terms of being a "shamanistic missionary and savior-figure" and notes Pindar places Abaris during the time of [[Croesus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Griffiths | first =Alan H. | contribution =Abaris | pages =1 | editor-last = Hornblower | editor-first = Simon | editor2-last = Spawforth | editor2-first = Anthony | title = The Oxford Classical Dictionary | publisher = OxfordUP | place = Oxford | publication-date = 2003 | edition=3rd | isbn=978-0-19-860641-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phalaris===
A particularly rich trove of anecdotes is found in [[Iamblichus (philosopher)|Iamblichus]]'s ''Vita Pythagorica''. Here, Abaris is said to have purified [[Sparta]] and [[Knossos]], among other cities, from plagues (''VP'' 92–93). Abaris also appears in a climactic scene alongside [[Pythagoras]] at the court of the [[Sicily|Sicilian]] [[tyrant]] [[Phalaris]]. The two sages discuss divine matters, and urge the obstinate tyrant towards virtue (ibid. 215–221). Iamblicus also attributes to Abaris a special expertise at [[extispicy]], the art of predicting future events through the examination of anomalies in the entrails of animals.&lt;ref&gt;"... and instead of divining by the entrails of beasts, he [Pythagoras] revealed to him the art of prognosticating by numbers conceiving this to be a method purer, more divine and more kindred to the celestial numbers of the Gods." from Iamblichus' ''Vita Pythagorica'' (trans. K. S. Guthrie).&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Suda]]'' attributes a number of books to Abaris, including a volume of ''Scythian Oracles'' in [[dactylic hexameter]], a prose [[theogony]], a poem on the marriage of the river Hebrus, a work on purifications, and an account of [[Apollo]]'s visit to the Hyperboreans. But such works, if they were really current in ancient times, were no more genuine than his reputed correspondence with [[Phalaris]] the tyrant.&lt;ref name="DGRBM"&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Schmitz  | first = Leonhard  | contribution = Abaris  | editor-last = Smith  | editor-first = William  | title = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]  | volume = 1  | pages = 1  | year = 1867  | contribution-url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0010.html  | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more securely historical Greco-Scythian philosopher, who travelled among the Hellenes in the early sixth century, was [[Anacharsis]].

Eighteenth century Bath architect John Wood, the Elder wrote about Abaris, and put forth the fanciful suggestion that he should be identified with King [[Bladud]].

==Modern impact==
* A Senior Society at [[Dartmouth College]] is named Abaris after this figure; it is one of eight Senior Societies among [[Dartmouth College student groups]].
* Abaris is featured in [[Therion (band)|Therion]] songs "An Arrow From The Sun" (''[[Lemuria (album)|Lemuria]]''), "[[Wand of Abaris|The Wand of Abaris]]", and "The Falling Stone" (''[[Gothic Kabbalah]]'').

[[File:Stone water trough at the Adullam ruin.jpg|thumb|right|''Khirbet 'Eîd el Mieh'', stone water trough (at the lower site)]]
'''Adullam''' ({{Lang-he-n|עֲדֻלָּם}}) is an ancient ruin, formerly known by the Arabic appellation ''ʿAīd el Mâ'' (or ''`Eîd el Mieh''), built upon a hilltop overlooking the [[Valley of Elah|Elah Valley]], south of [[Bet Shemesh]] in [[Israel]]. In the late 19th century, the town was still in ruins.&lt;ref&gt;Conder &amp; Kitchener, ''The Survey of Western Palestine'', [https://archive.org/details/surveyofwesternp03conduoft vol. III], London 1883, p. 311; On Palestine Exploration Fund Map: Hebron (Sheet XXI), the ruin of ''Khurbet 'Aid el Ma'' (sic) appears directly to the north of ''Khurbet esh-Sheikh Madhkur'', in the valley below. The ancient ruin is distinguished by its many razed structures lying in a field the size of a football field, interspersed with terebinths, directly alongside a small paved road that runs parallel to the main [[Roglit]] - [[Aderet, Israel|Aderet]] road: see Survey of Western Palestine, 1878 Map, Map 21: [http://www.iaa-archives.org.il/zoom/zoom.aspx?folder_id=93&amp;type_id=6&amp;id=8383 IAA], [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Survey_of_Western_Palestine_1880.21.jpg Wikimedia commons], as surveyed and drawn under the direction of Lieut. C.R. Conder and H.H. Kitchener, May 1878. [[Victor Guérin|Victor Guerin]] believed that there was once an Upper Adullam and a Lower Adullam.&lt;/ref&gt; The hilltop ruin is also known by the name ''Khurbet esh-Sheikh Madkour'', named after Madkour, one of the sons of the Sultan Beder, for whom is built a [[Maqam (shrine)|shrine]] (''wely'') and formerly called by its inhabitants ''Wely Madkour''.&lt;ref&gt;Conder &amp; Kitchener, ''Survey of Western Palestine'', [https://archive.org/details/surveyofwesternp03conduoft vol. III] (Judæa), London 1883, pp. 361–367.&lt;/ref&gt; The hilltop is mostly flat, with cisterns carved into the rock. The remains of stone structures which once stood there can still be seen. Sedimentary layers of ruins from the old Canaanite and Israelite eras, mostly potsherds, are noticeable everywhere, although olive groves now grow atop of this hill, enclosed within stone hedges. The villages of [[Aderet, Israel|Aderet]], [[Neve Michael]]/[[Roglit]], and [[Aviezer]] are located nearby. Access to the site may be obtained by passing through the cooperative small holders' agricultural villages (''Moshavim'') of [[Aderet, Israel|Aderet]] or [[Neve Michael]] (known also as Roglit). The ruin lies about 3 kilometers south of [[Moshav]] [[Neve Michael]].
==History==
===Biblical era=== 
The "Adullam" mentioned in the [[Hebrew Bible]] is usually thought to be identical with ''Tell Sheikh Madkhur'', that is, the archaeological ruin referred to in this article as "Adullam."&lt;ref name="Shaw1993"&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles S. Shaw|title=The Speeches of Micah: A Rhetorical-Historical Analysis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3VZ5JDCedtoC&amp;pg=PA45|date=1 November 1993|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-0-567-21443-0|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Claude R. Conder]], in ''Tent Work in Palestine'' (pub. Richard Bentley and Son: London 1878, p. [https://jupiter.ai/books/kwzJ/#page_276 276]), wrote: "The term ''Shephelah'' is used in the [[Talmud]] to mean the low hills of soft limestone, which, as already explained, form a distinct district between the plain and the watershed mountains. The name ''Sifla'', or ''Shephelah'', still exists in four or five places within the region round Beit Jibrîn, and we can therefore have no doubt as to the position of that district, in which Adullam is to be sought. [[Clermont-Ganneau|M. Clermont Ganneau]] was the fortunate explorer who first recovered the name, and I was delighted to find that Corporal Brophy had also collected it from half a dozen different people, without knowing that there was any special importance attaching to it. The title being thus recovered, without any leading question having been asked, I set out to examine the site, the position of which agrees almost exactly with the distance given by [[Jerome]], between [[Eleutheropolis]] and Adullam—ten Roman miles."&lt;/ref&gt; 

Adullam was one of the royal cities of the [[Canaan]]ites&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Joshua|12:15|HE}} and {{bibleverse||Joshua|15:35|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; referred to in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. Although listed in Joshua as being a city in the plain, it is actually partly in the hill country, partly in the plain. It stood near the highway which later became the [[Roman road]] in the  [[Valley of Elah]], the scene of [[David]]'s victory over [[Goliath]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Samuel|17:2|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was here that Judah, the son of Jacob (Israel), came when he left his father and brothers in [[Migdal Eder (biblical location)|Migdal Eder]], where he befriended a certain Hirah, an Adullamite,&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 38:1&lt;/ref&gt; and where he met his first wife (unnamed in [[Genesis (Hebrew Bible)|Genesis]]), the daughter of Shua. It was one of the towns which [[Rehoboam]] fortified against [[Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|11:7|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Book of Micah|Micah]] calls it "the glory of Israel."&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Micah|1:15|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Adullam,_the_hilltop_ruin.jpg|thumb|right|Ruin of Adullam. ''Wely Madkour'']]
King David sought refuge in Adullam after being expelled from the city of [[Gath (city)|Gath]] by King Achish. [[1 Samuel|I Samuel]] refers to the [[Cave of Adullam]] where he found protection while living as a refugee from King [[Saul]]. It was there that "every one that was in distress gathered together, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was discontented."&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Samuel|22:2|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain caves, grottos and sepulchres are still to be seen on the hilltop, as well as on its northern and eastern slopes.

It was in Adullam that [[Judas Maccabaeus]] retired with his fighting men, after returning from war against the [[Idumaeans]].&lt;ref&gt;[[2 Maccabees]], chapter 12&lt;/ref&gt; As late as the early 4th century CE, Adullam was described by [[Eusebius]] as being "a very large village about ten [Roman] miles east of [[Eleutheropolis]]."&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''Onomasticon - The Place Names of Divine Scripture'', (ed.) R. Steven Notley &amp; [[Ze'ev Safrai]], Brill: Leiden 2005, pp. 27 (§77), 82 (§414) {{ISBN|0-391-04217-3}}. As for the word "east," this is not to be understood directly east in relation to Beit Gubrin (Eleutheropolis), as proven by other descriptions of biblical place names in Eusebius' writings, but can also mean "northeast", as in this case, or "southeast".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ottoman era===
Adullam was an inhabited village in the late 16th-century. An Ottoman [[Daftar|tax ledger]] of 1596 lists ''`Ayn al-Mayyā'' ({{lang-ar|عين الميا}}) in the ''[[nahiya]]'' ''[[Hebron|Ḫalīl]]'' (Hebron subdistrict), and where it is noted that it had in 1596 thirty-six Muslim heads of households.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf-Dieter Hütteroth &amp; Kamal Abdulfattah, ''Historical Geography of Palestine, Transjordan and Southern Syria in the Late 16th Century'', Erlangen 1977, p. 122 {{ISBN|3-920405-41-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The copyist of the same tax ledger had erroneously mistaken the Arabic ''dal'' in the document for a ''nun'', and which name has since been corrected by historical geographers Yoel Elitzur and [[Ehud R. Toledano|Toledano]] to read ''A'ïd el-Miah'' ({{lang-ar|عيد الميا}}), based on the entry's number of fiscal unit in the ''daftar'' and its corresponding place on Hütteroth's map.&lt;ref&gt;Yoel Elitzur, ''Ancient Place Names in the Holy Land - Preservation and History'', Jerusalem / Winona Lake, Indiana 2004, p. 137 {{ISBN|1-57506-071-X}}; (The number of fiscal unit in the ''daftar'', corresponding to the map, is "P-17").&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Toledano |first=Ehud |authorlink=Ehud R. Toledano |title=The Sanjaq of Jerusalem in the Sixteenth Century: Aspects of Topography and Population |url=http://alkindi.ideo-cairo.org/manifestation/61348|journal =Archivum Ottomanicum|volume=9|pages=75 |date=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arabic name, being a corruption of ''Adullam'', is a product of popular etymology.

In the late 19th century, the hilltop ruin and its adjacent ruins were explored by French explorer, [[Victor Guérin]], who wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[Upon leaving the hilltop ruin, ''Khirbet el-Sheikh Madkour''], at 11:20 [AM], we descend to the east in the valley. At 11:25 [AM], I examine other ruins, called ''Khirbet A'id el-Miah''. Sixty toppled houses in the ''wadi'' formed a village that still existed in the Muslim period, as [proven by] the remains of a mosque there observed. In antiquity, the ruins that cover the plateau of the hill of ''Sheikh Madkour'' and which extend in the valley were probably one and the same city, divided into two parts, the upper part and the lower part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Guérin|first=Victor|authorlink=Victor Guérin|title=Description Géographique  Historique et Archéologique de la Palestine|url=https://archive.org/details/descriptiongogr06gugoog|volume=1: Judee,  pt. 3|year=1869|publisher= L'Imprimerie Nationale|location=Paris|language=French |pages=[https://archive.org/stream/descriptiongogr06gugoog#page/n351/mode/1up 338]–339}}&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to [[C. R. Conder|Conder]], an ancient road, leading from [[Beth-zur|Beit Sur]] to [[Ashdod]], once passed through ''ʿAīd el Mâ'' (Adullam).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conder|first1=C.R.|authorlink1=Claude Reignier Conder|last2=Kitchener|first2=H.H.|authorlink2=Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|year=1883|url=https://archive.org/details/surveyofwesternp03conduoft|title=The Survey of Western Palestine: Memoirs of the Topography, Orography, Hydrography, and Archaeology|location=London|publisher=[[Palestine Exploration Fund|Committee of the Palestine Exploration Fund]]|volume=3}},  p. [https://archive.org/stream/surveyofwesternp03conduoft#page/318/mode/1up 318]&lt;/ref&gt;

French [[Oriental studies|orientalist]] and archaeologist, [[Charles Clermont-Ganneau]], visited the site in 1874 and wrote: "The place is absolutely uninhabited, except during the rainy season, when the herdsmen take shelter there for the night."&lt;ref&gt;Charles Clermont-Ganneau, ''Archaeological Researches in Palestine During the Years 1873–1874'' (vol. 2), London 1896, p. [https://archive.org/stream/archaeologicalre02cler#page/458/mode/2up 459]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Previous attempts of identification===
Early drawings depicting the so-called "[[Cave of Adullam|Adullam cave]]" have tentatively been identified with the cavern of ''Umm el Tuweimin'', and the cave at ''Khureitun'' (named after Chariton the ascetic),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Palestine Exploration Fund]] Quarterly Statement'' of 1875, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; because of their immense size. Modern-day archaeologists have rejected these early hypotheses.&lt;ref&gt;C.R. Conder, ''[[Palestine Exploration Fund]] Quarterly Statement'' of 1875, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature reserve and park==
The [[Adullam Grove Nature Reserve]] is a nature reserve managed by the [[Israel Nature and National Parks Protection Authority]]. It was established in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of National Parks and Nature Reserves |url=http://parks.org.il/sigalit/muchrazim.pdf |language=Hebrew |publisher=Israel Nature and Parks Authority |accessdate=2010-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007095221/http://parks.org.il/sigalit/muchrazim.pdf |archivedate=2009-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Adullam Caves park is a [[JNF]] park of 50,000 [[dunam]]s ({{convert|12,355|acre|km2}}) of mostly pine forests, which were planted by Jewish immigrants who settled in the [[Hevel Lakhish|Lachish region]] in the early years of the state. The park was prepared for public use by the [[Israel Antiquities Authority]] and the [[Jewish National Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kkl.org.il/KKL/advanced_templateNoMenu.aspx?id=21482|script-title=he:פארק עדולם|trans-title=Adullam Park|publisher=JNF website|language=Hebrew|accessdate=16 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Today the park sits in an area that is threatened by [[Shale oil extraction#In_situ_technologies|shale oil extraction through the CCR ground-heating process]], with the [[Green Zionist Alliance]] and the grassroots group Save Adullam, among others, working to stop shale oil extraction in the region.&lt;ref name="Jewcology1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Israel: The New Saudi Arabia?|url=http://www.jewcology.com/content/view/Israel-The-New-Saudi-Arabia|publisher=Jewcology|date=1 May 2011 | first=David| last=Krantz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AFP"&gt;{{cite news|title=Shale oil project raises hackles in Israel|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jOOtf9U8a__sHlbBkgmMSGrUPnig|publisher=AFP|date=18 Dec 2011| first=Daniella| last=Cheslow}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GreenProphet"&gt;{{cite news|title=Saudi Turns to Solar, Israel Stuck on Shale|url=http://www.greenprophet.com/2013/03/saudi-solar-israel-stuck-on-shale/|publisher=Green Prophet|date=5 March 2013 | first=Tafline| last=Laylin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and ministry ==
Galarreta was born in 1957 at [[Torrelavega]] in [[Spain]], but emigrated early in life with his family to [[Argentina]]. In 1975 he entered the seminary at [[La Plata]], where he remained for three years. In October 1978 he entered the Society of St. Pius X's [[The International Seminary of Saint Pius X|International Seminary of Saint Pius X]] at [[Écône]] in [[Switzerland]].

In August 1980 he was [[Holy Orders|ordained]] a [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]] by Archbishop [[Marcel Lefebvre]] in [[Buenos Aires]]. After ordination he served first as a professor at the SSPX seminary in [[La Reja]], Argentina. From 1985 to 1988 he was superior of the SSPX district of South America.

== Consecration and excommunication ==
{{main|Écône consecrations}}
In June 1988 [[Archbishop]] [[Marcel Lefebvre]] announced his intention to consecrate de Galarreta and three other priests ([[Bernard Fellay]], [[Bernard Tissier de Mallerais]], and [[Richard Williamson (bishop)|Richard Williamson]]) as [[Bishop in the Catholic Church|bishop]]s. Lefebvre did not have a pontifical mandate for these consecrations (i.e. permission from the [[pope]]), normally required by Canon 1382 of the [[Canon law of the Catholic Church|Code of Canon Law]]. On June 17, 1988 [[cardinal (Catholic Church)|Cardinal]] [[Bernardin Gantin]], [[prefect]] of the [[Congregation for Bishops]] sent the four priests a formal canonical warning that he would automatically incur the penalty of [[excommunication]] if they were to be consecrated by Lefebvre without papal permission.

On June 30, 1988 de Galaretta and the three other priests were consecrated bishop by Archbishop Lefebvre and Bishop [[Antônio de Castro Mayer]]. On July 1, 1988 Cardinal Gantin issued a declaration stating that Lefebvre, de Castro Mayer, de Galaretta, and the three other newly-ordained bishops "have incurred ''[[ipso facto]]'' the [[excommunication]] ''[[latae sententiae]]'' reserved to the [[Apostolic See]]".

On July 2, 1988, [[Pope John Paul II]] issued the ''[[motu proprio]]'' ''[[Ecclesia Dei]]'', in which he reaffirmed the excommunication, and described the consecration as an act of "disobedience to the [[Roman pontiff]] in a very grave matter and of supreme importance for the unity of the Church", and that "such disobedience — which implies in practice the rejection of the [[Primacy of the Roman Pontiff|Roman primacy]] — constitutes a schismatic act".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/motu_proprio/documents/hf_jp-ii_motu-proprio_02071988_ecclesia-dei_en.html Apostolic letter ''Ecclesia Dei''] (July 2, 1988). Vatican.va. Accessed May 18, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
Cardinal [[Darío Castrillón Hoyos]], head of the commission responsible for implementing ''Ecclesia Dei'', has said this resulted in a "situation of separation, even if it was not a formal schism."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.30giorni.it/us/articolo_stampa.asp?id=9360 Interview for ''30 days''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060213203514/http://www.30giorni.it/us/articolo_stampa.asp?id=9360 |date=2006-02-13 }} (2005). ''30giorni''. Retrieved May 18, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The SSPX denied the validity of the excommunications, saying that the consecrations were necessary due to a moral and theological crisis in the Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sspx.org/SSPX_FAQs/q11_abexcommunicated.htm SSPX FAQ Question 11] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110412031202/http://www.sspx.org/SSPX_FAQs/q11_abexcommunicated.htm |date=2011-04-12 }} (29 June 1987).

==SSPX Bishop==
[[File:Alfonso de Galarreta.jpg|thumb|right|200px|de Galarreta in 2011]]
Following his episcopal consecration Galarreta was appointed rector of the seminary of La Reja. In 1991, he assisted in the consecration of [[Licínio Rangel]] as bishop for the [[Personal Apostolic Administration of Saint John Mary Vianney|Priestly society of saint John Mary Vianney]] after the death of its founder, bishop [[Antônio de Castro Mayer]].

In 1994 he became superior of the Society of Saint Pius X district of Spain and Portugal. In 2002 he became second assistant of the Society.

By a decree of 21 January 2009 (protocol number 126/2009), which was issued in response to a renewed request that Bishop [[Bernard Fellay|Fellay]] made on behalf of all four bishops whom Lefebvre had consecrated on 30 June 1988, the prefect of the Congregation for bishops, by the power expressly granted to him by pope Benedict XVI, remitted the automatic excommunication that they had thereby incurred, and expressed the wish that this would be followed speedily by full communion of the whole of the Society of saint Pius X with the Church, thus bearing witness, by the proof of visible unity, to true loyalty and true recognition of the pope's magisterium and authority.

The canonical situation of the four bishops thus supposedly became the same as that of the other clergy of the Society, who are suspended ''a divinis''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/CURIA/CEDSSPX.HTM Letter of the Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei of 29 September 1995]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported that bishop Galaretta had been named chairman of the SSPX commission in charge of the [[Dialogue between the Society of St. Pius X and the Holy See|theological discussions]] with the Holy See.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rorate-caeli.blogspot.com/2009/08/bishop-alfonso-de-galarreta-chairman-of.html Bishop Alfonso de Galarreta chairman of the SSPX commission]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ali is important to both Shias and [[Sunni Islam|Sunnis]], politically and spiritually.&lt;ref name="EOAli3"/&gt; The numerous biographical sources about Ali are often biased according to sectarian lines, but they agree that he was a pious Muslim, devoted to the cause of Islam and a just ruler in accordance with the [[Qur'an]] and the [[Sunnah]].&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt; While Sunnis consider Ali the fourth and final of the ''[[Rashidun]]'' (rightly guided) [[caliph]]s, Shia Muslims regard Ali as the first [[Imamah (Shia doctrine)|Imam]] after Muhammad due to their interpretation of the [[Hadith of the pond of Khumm|events at Ghadir Khumm]]. Shia Muslims also believe that Ali and the other [[Shia Imams]] (all of whom are members of the ''[[Ahl al-Bayt]]'') are the rightful successors to Muhammad. It was this disagreement that split the ''[[ummah]]'' into the Shia and Sunni branches.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EOAli3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Khumm"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dakake|2008|pp=34–39}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaIslam"/&gt;

==Life in Mecca==
===Early years===
{{Main|Family tree of Ali|Birthplace of Ali ibn Abi Talib}}
Ali's father, Abu Talib, was the custodian of the Ka'bah and a [[sheikh]] ({{lang-ar|شَـيـخ}}) of [[Banu Hashim]], an important branch of the powerful [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraysh]] tribe. He was also an uncle of Muhammad, and had raised Muhammad after Abdul Muttalib (Abu Talib's father and Muhammad's grandfather) died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Razwy|first1=Sayed Ali Asgher|title=A Restatement of the History of Islam &amp; Muslims|pages=35–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Glubb|first1=Sir John|title=The Life and Times of Mohammed|date=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ali's mother, Fatima bint Asad, also belonged to Banu Hashim, making Ali a descendant of [[Ishmael in Islam|Ismā'īl]] ({{lang-ar|إِسـمَـاعِـيـل}}, [[Ishmael]]) the son of [[Abraham in Islam|Ibrāhīm]] ({{lang-ar|إِبـرَاهِـيـم}}, [[Abraham]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ashraf|2005|p=5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Many sources, especially Shi'i ones, attest that Ali was born inside the Kaaba in the city of Mecca,&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Illustrated Dictionary of the Muslim World|publisher=Marshall Cavendish Reference|isbn=9780761479291|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Zp_5IydPGgC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;dq=ali+was+born+in+kaaba|accessdate=11 April 2017|language=en|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he stayed with his mother for three days.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; His mother reportedly felt the beginning of her labour pain while visiting the Ka'ba and entered it where her son was born. Some Shia sources contain miraculous descriptions of the entrance of Ali's mother into Ka'ba. Ali's birth in Ka'ba is regarded as a unique event proving his "high spiritual station" among Shia, while among various Sunni scholars it is considered a great, if not unique, distinction.&lt;ref name="Islamica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Faramarz Haj|first1=Manouchehri|last2=Matthew|first2=Melvin-Koushki|last3=Shah-Kazemi|first3=Reza|last4=Bahramian|first4=Ali|last5=Pakatchi|first5=Ahmad|last6=Muhammad Isa|first6=Waley|last7=Daryoush|first7=Mohammad|last8=Tareh|first8=Masoud|last9=Brown|first9=Keven|last10=Jozi|first10=Mohammad Reza|last11=Sajjadi|first11=Sadeq|last12=Gholami|first12=Rahim|last13=Bulookbashi|first13=Ali A.|last14=Negahban|first14=Farzin|last15=Alizadeh|first15=Mahbanoo|last16=Gholami|first16=Yadollah|title=ʿAlī b.

According to a tradition, Muhammad was the first person whom Ali saw as he took the newborn in his hands. Muhammad named him Ali, [[Ali (name)|meaning "the exalted one"]]. Muhammad had a close relationship with Ali's parents. When Muhammad was orphaned and later lost his grandfather [[Shaiba ibn Hashim|Abdul Muttalib]], Ali's father took him into his house.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; Ali was born two or three years after Muhammad married [[Khadijah bint Khuwaylid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ashraf|2005|p=6 and 7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; When Ali was five years old, Muhammad took Ali into his home to raise him. Some historians say that this was because there was a famine in Mecca at the time and that Ali's father had a large family to support; however, others point out that feeding Ali would not have been a burden on his father, as Ali was five years old at the time and, despite the famine, Ali's father, who was financially well-off, was known for giving food to strangers if they were hungry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Razwy|first1=Sayed Ali Asgher|title=A Restatement of the History of Islam &amp; Muslims|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it is not disputed that Muhammad raised Ali, it was not due to any financial stress that Ali's father was going through.

===Acceptance of Islam===
{{See also|Identity of the first male Muslim|Hijra (Islam)}}

Ali had been living with Muhammad and Muhammad's wife [[Khadija bint Khuwaylid|Khadija]] since he was five years old. When Ali was nine, Muhammad announced himself as the Prophet of Islam, and Ali became the first child to accept Islam. He was the second person, after Khadija, to accept Islam. According to Sayed Ali Asgher Razwy in ''A Restatement of the History of Islam &amp; Muslims,'' "Ali and Qur'an 'grew up' together as 'twins' in the house of Muhammad Mustafa and Khadija-tul-Kubra."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Razwy|first1=Sayed Ali Asgher|title=A Restatement of the History of Islam &amp; Muslims|page=52|accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second period of Ali's life began in 610 when he declared Islam at the age of 9, and ended with the [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]] of Muhammad to Medina in 622.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; When Muhammad reported that he had received a [[Wahy|divine revelation]], Ali, then only about nine years old, believed him and professed to Islam.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tabatabae191"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tabatabaei|1979|p=191}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ashraf 2005 p=14"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ashraf|2005|p=14}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Islam"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia = Encyclopaedia of Islam and the Muslim world; vol.1|last = Steigerwald|first = Diana|title = Alī ibn Abu Talib|publisher = Macmillan|isbn = 978-0-02-865604-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ali became the first male to [[Religious conversion#Conversion to Islam|embrace Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gleave|2015}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Restatement of the History of Islam &amp; Muslims|last1=Razwy|first1=Sayed Ali Asgher|pages=50–52|accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Introduction to the Translation of Holy Qur'an|last1=Pickhtall|first1=Marmaduke|date=1975|location=Lahore}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mohammed, the Man and his Faith|last1=Andre|first1=Tor|date=1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shia doctrine asserts that in keeping with Ali's divine mission, he accepted Islam before he took part in any [[Pre-Islamic Arabia|pre-Islamic]] Meccan [[Arabian mythology|traditional religion]] rites, regarded by Muslims as [[polytheism|polytheistic]] (see [[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]]) or [[paganism|paganistic]]. Hence the Shia say of Ali that his face is honoured, as it was never sullied by prostrations before idols.&lt;ref name="Tabatabae191"/&gt; The Sunnis also use the honorific ''Karam Allahu Wajhahu'', which means "God's Favour upon his Face." The reason his acceptance is often not called a conversion is because he was never an idol worshipper like the people of Mecca. He was known to have broken idols in the mould of Abraham and asked people why they worshipped something they made themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ali|url=http://imamali.net/old/?part=350|publisher=Imamali|accessdate=20 March 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150320075858/http://imamali.net/old/?part=350|archivedate=March 20, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abd al-Muttalib|Ali's grandfather]], along with some members of the Bani Hashim clan, were ''[[Hanif]]s'', or followers of a monotheistic belief system prior to the coming of Islam.

===The feast of Dhul Asheera===
{{main|Da'wat dhul-Ashira}}
Muhammad invited people to Islam in secret for three years before he started inviting them publicly. In the fourth year of Islam, when Muhammad was commanded to invite his closer relatives to come to Islam&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|26|214|style = ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; he gathered the Banu Hashim clan in a ceremony. At the banquet, he was about to invite them to Islam when [[Abu Lahab]] interrupted him, after which everyone left the banquet. The Prophet ordered Ali to invite the 40 people again. The second time, Muhammad announced Islam to them and invited them to join.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Razwy|first1=Sayed Ali Asgher|title=A Restatement of the History of Islam &amp; Muslims|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said to them,

{{quote|I offer thanks to Allah for His mercies. I praise Allah, and I seek His guidance. I believe in Him and I put my trust in Him. I bear witness that there is no god except Allah; He has no partners; and I am His messenger. Allah has commanded me to invite you to His religion by saying: And warn thy nearest kinsfolk. I, therefore, warn you, and call upon you to testify that there is no god but Allah, and that I am His messenger. O ye sons of Abdul Muttalib, no one ever came to you before with anything better than what I have brought to you. By accepting it, your welfare will be assured in this world and in the Hereafter. Who among you will support me in carrying out this momentous duty? Who will share the burden of this work with me? Who will respond to my call? Who will become my vicegerent, my deputy and my wazir?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Razwy|first1=Sayed Ali Asgher|title=A Restatement of the History of Islam &amp; Muslims|pages=54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Ali was the only one to answer Muhammad's call. Muhammad told him to sit down, saying, "Wait! Perhaps someone older than you might respond to my call." Muhammad then asked the members of Banu Hashim a second time. Once again, Ali was the only one to respond, and again, Muhammad told him to wait. Muhammad then asked the members of Banu Hashim a third time. Ali was still the only volunteer. This time, Ali's offer was accepted by Muhammad. Muhammad "drew [Ali] close, pressed him to his heart, and said to the assembly: 'This is my wazir, my successor and my vicegerent. Listen to him and obey his commands.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Razwy|first1=Sayed Ali Asgher|title=A Restatement of the History of Islam &amp; Muslims|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another narration, when Muhammad accepted Ali's eager offer, Muhammad "threw up his arms around the generous youth, and pressed him to his bosom" and said, "Behold my brother, my vizir, my vicegerent...Let all listen to his words, and obey him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Irving|first1=Washington|title=The Life of Mohammed}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon hearing this, the sons of [[Abd al-Muttalib]] departed from the feast, mocking Muhammad's words, as they scoffed at [[Abu Talib ibn Abd al-Muttalib]], "He has ordered you to listen and obey your son!".&lt;ref name = "Al Abbas"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Shahin |first1=Badr |title=Al-Abbas |date=2015 |publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform |location=CA |isbn=978-1519308115 |accessdate=19 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|17}}.  In Tarikh ut-Tabari and as-Seerat ul Halabiyya, it has been recorded that Abu Talib asks his son Ali, "What is this belief you are following?" to which Ali replies, "Father, I have believed in Allah and His Messenger, and have given credence to him, kept to him, and followed him."&lt;ref name="Al Abbas" /&gt;

[[Richard Francis Burton|Sir Richard Burton]] writes about the banquet in his 1898 book, saying, "It won for [Muhammad] a proselyte worth a thousand sabers in the person of Ali, son of Abu Talib."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burton|first1=Sir Richard|title=(The Jew the Gypsy and El Islam|date=1898|location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===During the oppression of Muslims===
During the [[Persecution of Muslims by the Meccans|persecution of Muslims]] and [[Meccan boycott of the Hashemites|boycott of the Banu Hashim]] in Mecca, Ali stood firmly in support of Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ashraf|2005|pp=16–26}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Migration to Medina===
{{See also|Hijra (Islam)}}
In 622, the year of Muhammad's migration to Yathrib (now Medina), Ali risked his life by sleeping in Muhammad's bed to impersonate him and thwart an assassination plot on Muhammad so that Muhammad could escape in safety.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tabatabae191"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ashraf|2005|p=28 and 29}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This night is called ''Laylat al-Mabit''. According to some ''a[[hadith]]'', a verse was revealed about Ali concerning his sacrifice on the night of Hijra which says "And among men is he who sells his ''[[nafs]]'' (self) in exchange for the pleasure of [[Allah]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|2|207|style = ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.almizan.org/ |title=Tafsir al-Mizan, Volume 3: Surah Baqarah, Verses 204–207 |first=Sayyid Mohammad Hosayn |last=Tabatabaei |publisher=almizan.org |accessdate=2010-11-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090617232037/http://almizan.org/ |archivedate=June 17, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ali survived the plot, but risked his life again by staying in Mecca to carry out Muhammad's instructions: to restore to their owners all the goods and properties that had been entrusted to Muhammad for safekeeping. 'Ali then went to Medina with Fatimah bint Asad (his mother), Fatimah bint Muhammad (Muhammad's daughter), and two other women.&lt;ref name="Iranica" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tabatabae191" /&gt;

==Life in Medina==
=== Muhammad's era ===
{{See also|Muhammad in Medina|Military career of Ali}}

Ali was 22 or 23 years old when he migrated to Medina. When Muhammad was creating bonds of [[Brotherhood among the Sahaba|brotherhood among his companions]], he selected Ali as his brother, claiming that "Ali and I belong to the same tree, while people belong to different trees.”&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tabatabae191"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ashraf|2005|pp=30–32}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Al Abbas" /&gt;. For the ten years that Muhammad led the community in Medina, Ali was extremely active in his service as his secretary and deputy, serving in his armies, the bearer of his banner in every battle, leading parties of warriors on raids, and carrying messages and orders.&lt;ref&gt;See:
* {{Harvnb|Momen|1985|p=13 and 14}}
* {{Harvnb|Ashraf|2005|pp=28–118}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As one of Muhammad's lieutenants, and later his son-in-law, Ali was a person of authority and standing in the Muslim community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mehboob Desia|title=Islam and non-violence|publisher=Gyan Book Pvt Ltd|isbn=81-212-1026-7|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Family life====
{{main|Ali marital life}}
{{See also|Ahl al-Bayt|Hadith of the Event of the Cloak|The verse of purification}}
In 623, Muhammad told 'Ali that God ordered him to give his daughter [[Fatimah Zahra]] to Ali in marriage.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; Muhammad said to Fatimah: "I have married you to the dearest of my family to me."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Singh|2003|p=175}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This family is glorified by Muhammad frequently and he declared them as his ''Ahl al-Bayt'' in events such as [[Mubahala]] and hadith like the [[Hadith of the Event of the Cloak]]. They were also glorified in the Qur'an in several cases such as "[[the verse of purification]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|33|33|style = ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Madelung|1997|p=14 and 15}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ali had four [[#Descendants|children]] born to Fatimah, the only child of Muhammad to have surviving progeny. Their two sons ([[Hasan ibn Ali|Hasan]] and [[Husain ibn Ali|Husain]]) were cited by Muhammad to be his own sons, honoured numerous times in his lifetime and titled "the leaders of the youth of Jannah" (Heaven, the hereafter.)&lt;ref&gt;See:

====Military career====
{{Campaignbox Campaigns of Ali}}
{{Main|Military career of Ali|List of expeditions of Muhammad}}

With the exception of the [[Battle of Tabouk]], Ali took part in all battles and expeditions fought for Islam.&lt;ref name="Tabatabae191"/&gt; As well as being the [[standard-bearer]] in those battles, Ali led parties of warriors on raids into enemy lands.

Ali first distinguished himself as a warrior in 624 at the [[Battle of Badr]]. The battle began with Ali defeating the Meccan champion [[Walid ibn Utba]]; one historian described Ali's opening victory at the battle as "the signal of the triumph of Islam."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Razwy|first1=Sayed Ali Asgher|title=A Restatement of the History of Islam &amp; Muslims|pages=136–137}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ali also defeated many other Meccan soldiers in the battle.

* {{Harvnb|Ashraf|2005|p=36}}
* {{Harvnb|Merrick|2005|p=247}}.
&lt;/ref&gt; while all the other Muslims combined killed another twenty-seven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Razwy|first1=Sayed Ali Asgher|title=A Restatement of the History of Islam &amp; Muslims|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ali was prominent at the [[Battle of Uhud]], as well as many other battles where he wielded a bifurcated sword known as [[Zulfiqar]].&lt;ref name="Battles-of-Badr-and-Uhud"&gt;{{cite book

"لا فتی الا علي لا سيف الا ذوالفقار"&lt;/ref&gt; He was commander of the Muslim army in the [[Battle of the Trench]] where he defeated the legendary Arab warrior, [[Amr ibn Abd al-Wud]].&lt;ref&gt;See:
* {{Harvnb|Ashraf|2005|pp=66–68}}
* {{Harvnb|Zeitlin|2007|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Muhammad made Ali commander at this battle, claiming that “I will hand the standard to a man who loves Allah and His Messenger and is loved by Allah and His Messenger. He will come back with conquest."&lt;ref name="Al Abbas" /&gt; Following this battle Muhammad gave Ali the name ''[[Lions in Islam|Asadullâh]]'' ({{lang-ar|أَسَـدُ الله}}), which means "Lion of God" and reportedly praised him, saying “Ali’s strike on Amr ibn Abd al-Wud is greater than the worship of both mankind and jinn until the Day of Judgement.”&lt;ref name="Al Abbas" /&gt; Ali also defended Muhammad in the [[Battle of Hunayn]] in 630.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;

Muhammad designated 'Ali as one of the scribes who would write down the text of the Quran, which had been revealed to Muhammad during the previous two decades. As Islam began to spread throughout Arabia, Ali helped establish the new Islamic order. He was instructed to write down the [[Treaty of Hudaybiyyah]], the peace treaty between Muhammad and the Quraysh in 628. Ali was so reliable and trustworthy that Muhammad asked him to carry the messages and declare the orders. In 630, Ali recited to a large gathering of pilgrims in Mecca [[At-Tawba|a portion of the Quran]] that declared Muhammad and the Islamic community were no longer bound by agreements made earlier with Arab [[polytheist]]s. During the [[Conquest of Mecca]] in 630, Muhammad asked Ali to guarantee that the conquest would be bloodless. He ordered Ali to break all the idols worshipped by the [[Banu Aus]], [[Banu Khazraj]], [[Tayy]], and those in the Ka'bah to purify it after its defilement by the polytheism of the [[Jahiliyah|pre-Islamic era]]. Ali was sent to Yemen one year later to spread the teachings of Islam. He was also charged with settling several disputes and putting down the uprisings of various tribes.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt;

====Incident of the ''Mubahalah''====
{{Main|Event of Mubahala}}
{{See also|Ahl al-Bayt}}
According to hadith collections, in 631, an [[Arab Christians|Arab Christian]] envoy from [[Najran]] (currently in northern [[Yemen]] and partly in [[Saudi Arabia]]) came to Muhammad to argue which of the two parties erred in its doctrine concerning Jesus. After likening Jesus' miraculous birth to Adam's creation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|3|59|style = ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Muhammad called them to ''[[mubahala]]'' (conversation), where each party should bring their knowledgeable men, women and children, and ask God to curse the lying party and their followers.&lt;ref name="cite quran|3|61|style = ref"&gt;{{cite quran|3|61|style = ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Muhammad, to prove to them that he was a prophet, brought his daughter Fatimah, 'Ali and his grandchildren Hasan and Husayn. He went to the Christians and said "this is my family" and covered himself and his family with a cloak.&lt;ref&gt;See:
* [[Sahih Muslim]], Chapter of virtues of companions, section of virtues of Ali, 1980 Edition Pub. in Saudi Arabia, Arabic version, v4, p1871, the end of tradition No.&amp;nbsp;32
* Sahih al-Tirmidhi, v5, p654
* {{Harvnb|Madelung|1997|p=15 and 16}}.
&lt;/ref&gt; According to Muslim sources, when one of the Christian monks saw their faces, he advised his companions to withdraw from Mubahala for the sake of their lives and families. Thus the Christian monks vanished from the Mubahala place. [[Allameh Tabatabaei]] explains in ''[[Tafsir al-Mizan]]'' that the word "Our selves" in this verse&lt;ref name="cite quran|3|61|style = ref"/&gt; refers to Muhammad and Ali. Then he narrates that [[Imam Ali al-Rida]], eighth [[Twelve Imams|Shia Imam]], in discussion with [[Al-Ma'mun]], [[Abbasid]] caliph, referred to this verse to prove the superiority of Muhammad's progeny over the rest of the Muslim community, and considered it the proof for Ali's right for caliphate due to God having made Ali like the self of Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.almizan.org/ |title=Tafsir al-Mizan, v.6, Al Imran, verses 61–63 |first=Sayyid Mohammad Hosayn |last=Tabatabaei |publisher=almizan.org |accessdate=2010-11-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090617232037/http://almizan.org/ |archivedate=June 17, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; SO,

As Muhammad was returning from [[The Farewell Pilgrimage|his last pilgrimage]] in 632, he made statements about Ali that are interpreted very differently by Sunnis and Shias.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; He halted the caravan at [[Rabigh#Ghadir Al-Khumm|Ghadir Khumm]], gathered the returning pilgrims for communal prayer and began to address them.&lt;ref name="Khumm"/&gt;

According to [[Encyclopedia of Islam]]:
{{quote|text=Taking Ali by the hand, he asked of his faithful followers whether he, Muhammad, was not closer (awlā) to the Believers than they were to themselves; the crowd cried out: "It is so, O Apostle of God!"; he then declared: "He of whom I am the [[mawla]], of him Ali is also the mawla (man kuntu mawlāhu fa-ʿAlī mawlāhu)".&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaIslam"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Veccia Vaglieri |first=Laura |authorlink=Laura Veccia Vaglieri |title=G̲h̲adīr K̲h̲umm |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia of Islam, Second Edition |accessdate=2013-03-28 |publisher=Brill Online |url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2/ghadir-khumm-SIM_2439 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130331002156/http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2/ghadir-khumm-SIM_2439 |archivedate=March 31, 2013 |deadurl=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See:

Shias regard these statements as constituting the designation of Ali as the [[succession to Muhammad|successor of Muhammad]] and as the first [[Imamah (Shia doctrine)|Imam]]; by contrast, Sunnis take them only as an expression of close spiritual relationship between Muhammad and Ali, and of his wish that Ali, as his cousin and son-in-law, inherit his family responsibilities upon his death, but not necessarily a designation of political authority.

===After Muhammad===
====Succession to Muhammad====
{{See also|Origin and development of the Quran|Succession to Muhammad|Saqifah|Rashidun|Hadith of position}}

Another part of Ali's life started in 632, after the death of Muhammad and lasted until the assassination of 'Uthman ibn 'Affan, the third caliph in 656. During those 24 years, Ali neither took part in any battle or [[Muslim conquests|conquest]],&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt; nor did he assume any executive position. He withdrew from political affairs, especially after the death of his wife, Fatimah Zahra. He used his time to serve his family and worked as a farmer. Ali dug a lot of wells and planted gardens near Medina and endowed them for public use. These wells are known today as ''[[Abar Ali]]'' ("Ali's wells").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Abar Ali mosque|url=http://www.ircicaarchdata.org/ircica/level1.php?id=750|publisher=IRCICAARCH data|accessdate=23 May 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402091323/http://www.ircicaarchdata.org/ircica/level1.php?id=750|archivedate=April 2, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ali compiled a complete version of the Quran, ''[[mus'haf]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last = Nasr |first = Seyyed Hossein|authorlink = Seyyed Hossein Nasr|title = Quran |year = 2007| encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica Online|accessdate = 2007-11-04|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-68890/Quran| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071016200056/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-68890/Quran| archivedate= October 16, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; six months after the death of Muhammad. The volume was completed and carried by camel to show to other people of Medina. The order of this ''mus'haf'' differed from that which was gathered later during the [[Uthman Ibn Affan|Uthmanic]] era. This book was rejected by several people when he showed it to them. Despite this, Ali made no resistance against ''[[Origin and development of the Quran#Standardization|standardised mus'haf]]''.&lt;ref&gt;See:

====Ali and the Rashidun caliphs====
{{See also|The election of Uthman|Siege of Uthman}}
[[File:Ambigram - Muhammad and Ali2.svg|thumb|[[Ambigram]] depicting Muhammad (right) and Ali (left) written in a single word. The 180 degree inverted form shows both words.]]

After uniting the [[Tribes of Arabia|Arabian tribes]] into a single Muslim religious polity in the last years of his life, Muhammad's death in 632 signalled disagreement over who would succeed him as leader of the Muslim community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lapidus|2002|p=31 and 32}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Ali and the rest of Muhammad's close family were washing his body for burial, at a gathering attended by a small group of Muslims at [[Saqifah]], a close companion of Muhammad named Abu Bakr was nominated for the leadership of the community. Others added their support and Abu Bakr was made the first caliph. The choice of Abu Bakr was disputed by some of Muhammad's companions, who held that Ali had been designated his successor by Muhammad himself.&lt;ref name="Islam"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See:
* {{Harvnb|Holt|Lambton|Lewis|1970|p=57}}
* {{Harvnb|Madelung|1997|pp=26–27, 30–43 and 356–360}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Later when Fatimah and Ali sought aid from the Companions in the matter of his right to the caliphate, they answered 'O daughter of the Messenger of God! We have given our allegiance to Abu Bakr. If Ali had come to us before this, we would certainly not have abandoned him'. Ali said, 'Was it fitting that we should wrangle over the caliphate even before the Prophet was buried?'&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Qutaybah, al-Imamah wa al-Siyasah, Vol. I, pp. 12–13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Abi al-Hadid, Sharh; Vol. II, p.5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his election to the caliphate, Abu Bakr and [[Umar]] with a few other companions headed to [[Umar at Fatimah's house|Fatimah's house]] to force Ali and his supporters who had gathered there to give their allegiance to Abu Bakr. Then, it is alleged that Umar threatened to set the house on fire unless they came out and swore allegiance to Abu Bakr.&lt;ref name="Madelung, 1997, p. 43"&gt;{{Harvnb|Madelung|1997|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fatimah]], in support of her husband, started a commotion and threatened to "uncover her hair", at which Abu Bakr relented and withdrew.&lt;ref name=EoI/&gt; Ali is reported to have repeatedly said that had there been forty men with him he would have resisted.&lt;ref name="Madelung, 1997, p. 43"/&gt; Ali did not actively assert his own right because he did not want to throw the nascent Muslim community into strife.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt; Other sources say that Ali accepted the selection of Umar as caliph and even gave one of his daughters, Umm Kulthūm, to him in marriage.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;
[[File:Mirror writing2.jpg|thumb|18th century [[mirror writing]] in [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[calligraphy]]. Depicts the phrase 'Ali is the vicegerent of God' in both directions.]]

This contentious issue caused Muslims to later split into two groups, Sunni and Shia. Sunnis assert that even though Muhammad never appointed a successor, Abu Bakr was elected first caliph by the Muslim community. The Sunnis recognise the first four caliphs as [[Rashidun|Muhammad's rightful successors]]. Shias believe that Muhammad explicitly named Ali as his successor at Ghadir Khumm and Muslim leadership belonged to him which had been determined by divine order.&lt;ref name="Islam"/&gt;

According to [[Wilferd Madelung]], Ali himself was firmly convinced of his legitimacy for [[caliphate]] based on his close kinship with Muhammad, his intimate association and his knowledge of Islam and his merits in serving its cause. He told Abu Bakr that his delay in pledging allegiance (''[[bay'ah]]'') as caliph was based on his belief of his own prior title. Ali did not change his mind when he finally pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr and then to Umar and to Uthman but had done so for the sake of the unity of Islam, at a time when it was clear that the Muslims had turned away from him.&lt;ref name="Islam"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See:
* {{Harvnb|Madelung|1997|p=141 and 270}}
* {{Harvnb|Ashraf|2005|p=99 and 100}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Ali also believed that he could fulfill his role of Imam'ate without this fighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chirri|1982|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 	
At the beginning of Abu Bakr's caliphate, there was a controversy about Muhammad's endowment to his daughter, especially [[Fadak]], between Fatimah and Ali on one side and Abu Bakr on the other side. Fatimah asked Abu Bakr to turn over their property, the lands of [[Fadak]] and [[Khaybar]]. But Abu Bakr refused and told her that [[Prophets of Islam|prophets]] did not have any legacy and that Fadak belonged to the Muslim community. Abu Bakr said to her, "Allah's Apostle said, we do not have heirs, whatever we leave is [[Sadaqa]]." Together with [[Umm Ayman]], Ali testified to the fact that Muhammad granted it to Fatimah Zahra, when Abu Bakr requested her to summon witnesses for her claim. Fatimah became angry and stopped speaking to Abu Bakr, and continued assuming that attitude until she died.

'Aishah also said that "When Allah's Apostle died, his wives intended to send 'Uthman to Abu Bakr asking him for their share of the inheritance." Then 'Aisha said to them, "Didn't Allah's Apostle say, 'Our (Apostles') property is not to be inherited, and whatever we leave is to be spent in charity?'".&lt;ref&gt;Sahih Al Bukhari, Volume 8, Book 80, Number 722 [sahih-bukhari.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some sources, 'Ali did not give his oath of allegiance to Abu Bakr until some time after the death of his wife, Fatimah in the year 633.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt; 'Ali participated in the funeral of Abu Bakr.&lt;ref&gt;

He pledged allegiance to the second caliph '[[Umar ibn Khattab]] and helped him as a trusted advisor. 'Umar particularly relied upon Ali as the chief judge of Medina. He also advised Umar to set Hijra as the beginning of the [[Islamic calendar]]. 'Umar used 'Ali's suggestions in political issues as well as religious ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ashraf|2005|pp=107–110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'Ali was one of [[The election of Uthman|the electoral council to choose the third caliph]] which was appointed by 'Umar. Although 'Ali was one of the two major candidates, the council's arrangement was against him. [[Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas]] and [[Abdur Rahman bin Awf]], who were cousins, were naturally inclined to support Uthman, who was Abdur Rahman's brother-in-law. In addition, Umar gave the casting vote to Abdur Rahman. Abdur Rahman offered the caliphate to Ali on the condition that he should rule in accordance with the Quran, the [[Sunnah|example set by Muhammad]], and the precedents established by the first two caliphs. Ali rejected the third condition while Uthman accepted it. According to [[Comments on the Peak of Eloquence (Ibn Abi al-Hadid)|Ibn Abi al-Hadid's Comments on the Peak of Eloquence]] Ali insisted on his prominence there, but most of the electors supported Uthman and Ali was reluctantly urged to accept him.&lt;ref&gt;See:
* {{Harvnb|Madelung|1997|pp=70–72}}
* {{Harvnb|Dakake|2008|p=41}}
* {{Harvnb|Momen|1985|p=21}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

'Uthman ibn 'Affan expressed generosity toward his kin, [[Banu Abd-Shams]], who seemed to dominate him, and his supposed arrogant mistreatment toward several of the earliest companions such as [[Abu Dharr al-Ghifari]], [[Abd-Allah ibn Mas'ud]] and [[Ammar ibn Yasir]] provoked outrage among some groups of people. Dissatisfaction and resistance openly arose since 650–651 throughout most of the empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Madelung|1997|p=87 and 88}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dissatisfaction with his rule and the governments appointed by him was not restricted to the provinces outside [[Arabia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Madelung|1997|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Uthman's kin, especially [[Marwan I|Marwan]], gained control over him, the noble companions, including most of [[The election of Uthman|the members of elector council]], turned against him or at least withdrew their support, putting pressure on the caliph to mend his ways and reduce the influence of his assertive kin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Madelung|1997|pp=92–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time, 'Ali had acted as a restraining influence on Uthman without directly opposing him. On several occasions Ali disagreed with Uthman in the application of the [[Hudud]]; he had publicly shown sympathy for Abu Dharr al-Ghifari and had spoken strongly in the defence of Ammar ibn Yasir. He conveyed to Uthman the criticisms of other Companions and acted on Uthman's behalf as negotiator with the provincial opposition who had come to Medina; because of this some mistrust between Ali and Uthman's family seems to have arisen. Finally, he tried to mitigate the severity of [[Siege of Uthman|the siege]] by his insistence that Uthman should be allowed water.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt;

There is controversy among historians about the relationship between Ali and Uthman. Although pledging allegiance to Uthman, Ali disagreed with some of his policies. In particular, he clashed with Uthman on the question of religious law. He insisted that [[Hudud|religious punishment]] had to be done in several cases such as [[Ubayd Allah ibn Umar]] and [[Walid ibn Uqba]]. In 650 during [[Hajj|pilgrimage]], he confronted Uthman with reproaches for his change of the prayer ritual. When Uthman declared that he would take whatever he needed from the [[fey']], Ali exclaimed that in that case the caliph would be prevented by force. Ali endeavoured to protect companions from maltreatment by the caliph such as [[Ibn Mas'ud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Madelung|1997|p=109 and 110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, some historians consider Ali one of the leading members of Uthman's opposition, if not the main one. But [[Wilferd Madelung]] rejects their judgment due to the fact that Ali did not have the Quraysh's support to be elected as a caliph. According to him, there is even no evidence that Ali had close relations with rebels who supported his caliphate or directed their actions.
&lt;ref&gt;See:
* {{Harvnb|Holt|Lambton|Lewis|1970|p=67 and 68}}
* {{Harvnb|Madelung|1997|p=107 and 111}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Some other sources say Ali had acted as a restraining influence on Uthman without directly opposing him.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt; However, Madelung narrates [[Marwan I|Marwan]] told [[Zayn al-Abidin]], the grandson of Ali, that
&lt;blockquote&gt;No one [among the Islamic nobility] was more temperate toward our master than your master.&lt;ref name="Madelung 1997 334"&gt;{{Harvnb|Madelung|1997|p=334}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:First Fitna map blank.svg|thumb|Domains of [[Rashidun caliphate]] under [[Rashidun|four caliphs]]. The divided phase relates to the Rashidun caliphate of 'Ali during the [[First Fitna]].

'Ali was caliph between 656 and 661, during one of the most turbulent periods in Muslim history, which also coincided with the First Fitnah. Since the conflicts in which Ali was involved were perpetuated in polemical sectarian historiography, biographical material is often biased. But the sources agree that he was a profoundly religious man, devoted to the cause of Islam and the rule of justice in accordance with the Qur'an and the [[Sunnah]]; he engaged in war against erring Muslims as a matter of religious duty. The sources abound in notices on his austerity, rigorous observance of religious duties, and detachment from worldly goods. Thus some authors have pointed out that he lacked political skill and flexibility.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt;

===Election===
Uthman's assassination meant that rebels had to select a new caliph. This met with difficulties since the rebels were divided into several groups comprising the ''[[Muhajirun]]'', ''[[Ansar (Islam)|Ansar]]'', [[Egypt]]ians, Kufans and [[Bassorah|Basrites]]. There were three candidates: Ali, [[Talha]]h and [[Zubayr ibn al-Awam|Al-Zubayr]]. First the rebels approached Ali, requesting him to accept being the fourth caliph.

Talhah, Zubayr and other companions also refused the rebels' offer of the caliphate. Therefore, the rebels warned the inhabitants of Medina to select a caliph within one day, or they would apply drastic action. In order to resolve the deadlock, the Muslims gathered in ''[[Al-Masjid an-Nabawi]]'' ({{lang-ar|الـمَـسـجـد الـنَّـبـوي}}, "The Masjid of the Prophet") on June 18, 656, to appoint the caliph. Initially, 'Ali refused to accept it, simply because his most vigorous supporters were rebels. However, when some notable companions of Muhammad, in addition to the residents of Medina, urged him to accept the offer, he finally agreed. According to [[Abu Mekhnaf]]'s narration, Talhah was the first prominent companion who gave his pledge to 'Ali, but other narrations claimed otherwise, stating they were forced to give their pledge. Also, Talhah and Az-Zubayr later claimed they supported him reluctantly. Regardless, Ali refuted these claims, insisting they recognised him as caliph voluntarily. [[Wilferd Madelung]] believes that force did not urge people to give their pledge and they pledged publicly in the mosque.&lt;ref name="Ashraf (2005), pp. 119-120"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ashraf|2005|p=119 and 120}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Madelung (1997), pp. 141-145"&gt;{{Harvnb|Madelung|1997|pp=141–145}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the overwhelming majority of Medina's population as well as many of the rebels gave their pledge, some important figures or tribes did not do so. The Umayyads, kinsmen of Uthman, fled to the [[Levant]], or remained in their houses, later refusing 'Ali's legitimacy. [[Sa'ad ibn Abi Waqqas]] was absent and [[Abdullah ibn Umar|'Abdullah ibn 'Umar]] abstained from offering his allegiance, but both of them assured 'Ali that they would not act against him.&lt;ref name="Ashraf (2005), pp. 119-120"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Madelung (1997), pp. 141-145"/&gt;

Ali thus inherited the Rashidun caliphate — which extended from Egypt in the west to the [[Iranian Plateau|Iranian highlands]] in the east—while the situation in the [[Hejaz]] and the other provinces on the eve of his election was unsettled. Soon after Ali became caliph, he dismissed provincial governors who had been appointed by Uthman, replacing them with trusted aides. He acted against the counsel of [[Mughira ibn Shu'ba]] and [[Ibn Abbas|Ibn 'Abbas]], who had advised him to proceed with his governing cautiously. Madelung says Ali was deeply convinced of his right and his religious mission, unwilling to compromise his principles for the sake of political expediency, and ready to fight against overwhelming odds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Madelung|1997|p=148 and 149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muawiyah I, the kinsman of Uthman and governor of the Levant, refused to submit to Ali's orders; he was the only governor to do so.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt;

===Inaugural address in Medina===
[[File:Arabic caligraphic seal in Hagia Sophia.jpg|thumb|The name of ''Ali with [[Islamic calligraphy]]'' in [[Hagia Sophia]], {{smaller|(present-day [[Turkey]])}}]]

When he was appointed caliph, Ali stated to the citizens of Medina that Muslim polity had come to be plagued by dissension and discord; he desired to purge Islam of any evil. He advised the populace to behave as true Muslims, warning that he would tolerate no sedition and those who were found guilty of subversive activities would be dealt with harshly.&lt;ref name="Ashraf (2005), p. 121"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ashraf|2005|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The First Fitnah===

[[A'isha]]h, [[Talhah]], [[Zubayr ibn al-Awam|Al-Zubayr]] and the Umayyads, especially [[Muawiyah I]] and [[Marwan I]], wanted 'Ali to punish the rioters who had killed [[Uthman]].&lt;ref name="Nahj al Balagha Sermon 72"&gt;[http://www.nahjulbalagha.org/SermonDetail.php?Sermon=72 Nahj al Balagha Sermon 72] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507092829/http://www.nahjulbalagha.org/SermonDetail.php?Sermon=72 |date=May 7, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=H-k9oc9xsuAC&amp;pg=PA131&amp;dq=battle+of+the+camel,+Muawiya+and+marwan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7Q4lUeiNDaO80QWBlYGgDw&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=battle%20of%20the%20camel%2C%20Muawiya%20and%20marwan&amp;f=false|title=Medieval Islamic Civilization|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They encamped close to Basra.

&lt;/ref&gt;
Some historians{{who|date=December 2017}} believe that they used this issue to seek their political ambitions because they found Ali's caliphate against their own benefit. The rebels maintained that Uthman had been justly killed, for not governing according to Quran and Sunnah, hence no vengeance was to be invoked.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tabatabae191"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See:
* {{Harvnb|Madelung|1997|p=147 and 148}}
* {{Harvnb|Lewis|1991|p=214}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Some say the caliphate was a gift of the rebels and Ali did not have enough force to control or punish them,&lt;ref name="Ashraf (2005), p. 121"/&gt; while others say Ali accepted the rebels' argument or at least did not consider Uthman a just ruler&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewis|1991|p=214}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Ali himself writes in his famous work, [[Nahj al-Balagha]], that he was blamed by the Umayyads for the assassination of Uthman.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nahj al-Balagha: Sermons, letters, and sayings of Hazrat Ali|last=ibn al-Ḥusayn Sharīf al-Radi|first=Muhammad|publisher=Tahrike Tarsile Qurʼan; 2nd edition|year=1981|isbn=978-0940368002|location=NY|pages=Sermon 75}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The Umayyads knowledge of me did not restrain them from accusing me, nor did my precedence in accepting Islam keep these ignorant people from blaming me. Allah's admonitions are more eloquent than my tongue. I am the contester against those who break away from Faith and the opposer of those who entertain doubts. Uncertainties should be placed before Qur'an, the Book of Allah (for clarification). Certainly, people will be recompensed according to what they have in their hearts. - ''Nahj al-Balagha: Sermon 75''&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Under such circumstances, a schism took place which led to the first civil war in Muslim history. Some Muslims, known as Uthmanis, considered Uthman a rightful and just [[caliph]] till the end, who had been unlawfully killed. Some others, who are known as party of Ali, believed Uthman had fallen into error, he had forfeited the caliphate and been lawfully executed for his refusal to mend his ways or step down; thus Ali was the just and true Imam and his opponents are infidels. This was not the position of Ali himself. This civil war created permanent divisions within the Muslim community regarding who had the legitimate right to occupy the caliphate.&lt;ref&gt;See:
* {{Harvnb|Lapidus|2002|p=47}}

The First Fitna, 656–661, followed the assassination of [[Uthman]], continued during the caliphate of Ali, and was ended by Muawiyah's assumption of the caliphate. This civil war (often called the ''[[Fitna (word)|Fitna]]'') is regretted as the end of the early unity of the Islamic ummah (nation).&lt;ref&gt;See:

Ali appointed [['Abd Allah ibn al'-Abbas]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last= |first= |authorlink= |editor-first= |editor-last= |editor-link= |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|title='Abd Allah ibn al-'Abbas|edition=15th |year=2010| publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|volume=I: A-Ak - Bayes|location= Chicago, Illinois|isbn=978-1-59339-837-8|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; governor of Basra and moved his capital to [[Kufa]], the Muslim garrison city in Iraq. Following the [[Roman-Persian Wars]] and the [[Byzantine–Sasanian wars]] that lasted for hundreds of years, there were deep rooted differences between Iraq, formally under the Persian [[Sassanid Empire]] and Syria formally under the [[Byzantine]] Empire. The Iraqis wanted the capital of the newly established Islamic State to be in Kufa so as to bring revenues into their area and oppose Syria.&lt;ref name="Iraq a Complicated State p. 32"&gt;Iraq a Complicated State: Iraq's Freedom War By Karim M. S. Al-Zubaidi, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; They convinced Ali to come to Kufa and establish the capital in Kufa, in Iraq.&lt;ref name="Iraq a Complicated State p. 32"/&gt;

Later Muawiyah I, the governor of Levant and the cousin of [[Uthman]], refused Ali's demands for allegiance. Ali opened negotiations hoping to regain his allegiance, but Muawiyah insisted on Levant autonomy under his rule. Muawiyah replied by mobilising his Levantine supporters and refusing to pay homage to Ali on the pretext that his contingent had not participated in his election. Ali then moved his armies north and the two armies encamped themselves at [[Siffin]] for more than one hundred days, most of the time being spent in negotiations. Although Ali exchanged several letters with Muawiyah, he was unable to dismiss the latter, nor persuade him to pledge allegiance. Skirmishes between the parties led to the [[Battle of Siffin]] in 657.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lapidus47"&gt;See:
* {{Harvnb|Lapidus|2002|p=47}}
* {{Harvnb|Holt|Lambton|Lewis|1970|pp=70–72}}
* {{Harvnb|Tabatabaei|1979|p=53 and 54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a week of combat was followed by a violent battle known as ''laylat al-harir'' (the night of clamour), Muawiyah's army was on the point of being routed when [[Amr ibn al-Aas]] advised Muawiyah to have his soldiers hoist ''[[mus'haf]]'' (either parchments inscribed with verses of the Quran, or complete copies of it) on their spearheads in order to cause disagreement and confusion in Ali's army.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lapidus47"/&gt; Ali saw through the stratagem, but only a minority wanted to pursue the fight.&lt;ref name="Islam"/&gt;
The two armies finally agreed to settle the matter of who should be caliph by arbitration. The refusal of the largest bloc in Ali's army to fight was the decisive factor in his acceptance of the arbitration. The question as to whether the arbiter would represent Ali or the Kufans caused a further split in Ali's army. [[Ash'ath ibn Qays]] and some others rejected Ali's nominees, [['Abd Allah ibn 'Abbas]] and [[Malik al-Ashtar]], and insisted on [[Abu Musa Ash'ari]], for his neutrality. Finally, Ali was urged to accept Abu Musa. [[Amr ibn al-As]] was appointed by Muawiyah as an arbitrator. Seven months later the two arbitrators met at Adhruh about 10 miles north west of Maan in Jordan in February 658. [[Amr ibn al-As]] convinced [[Abu Musa Ash'ari]] that both Ali and Muawiyah should step down and a new caliph be elected. Ali and his supporters were stunned by the decision which had lowered the caliph to the status of the rebellious Muawiyah. Ali was therefore outwitted by Muawiyah and [[Amr ibn al-As]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Conflict and Conquest in the Islamic World: A Historical Encyclopedia |first=Alexander |last=Mikaberidze|authorlink=Alexander Mikaberidze|page= 836 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jBBYD2J2oE4C&amp;pg=PA836&amp;dq=Muawiyah+ali+at+Siffin&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=v18mUfCsC-Om0AX99IDQBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Muawiyah%20ali%20at%20Siffin&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=L_xxOM85bD8C&amp;pg=PA602&amp;dq=Muawiyah+ali+at+Siffin&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=v18mUfCsC-Om0AX99IDQBQ&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Muawiyah%20ali%20at%20Siffin&amp;f=false|title=Ground Warfare|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
When the arbitrators assembled at [[Daumet-ul-Jandal]], a series of daily meetings were arranged for them to discuss the matters in hand. When the time arrived for taking a decision about the [[caliphate]], Amr bin al-A'as convinced [[Abu Musa al-Ashari]] into entertaining the opinion that they should deprive both Ali and Muawiya of the caliphate, and give to the Muslims the right to elect the caliph. Abu Musa al-Ashari also decided to act accordingly.&lt;ref name="autogenerated16"&gt;A Chronology of Islamic History 570–1000 CE By H U Rahman Page 59&lt;/ref&gt; According to Poonawala, it seems that the arbiters and other eminent persons, with the exclusion of Ali's representatives, met in January 659 to discuss the selection of the new caliph. Amr supported Muawiyah, while Abu Musa preferred his son-in-law, [[Abdullah ibn Umar]], but the latter refused to stand for election in default of unanimity. Abu Musa then proposed, and Amr agreed, to depose both Ali and Muawiyah and submit the selection of the new caliph to a [[Shura]]. In the public declaration that followed Abu Musa observed his part of the agreement, but Amr declared Ali deposed and confirmed Muawiya as caliph.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt;

Ali refused to accept the verdict of him stepping down and for an election to be held and found himself technically in breach of his pledge to abide by the arbitration.&lt;ref name="autogenerated17"&gt;A Chronology of Islamic History 570–1000 CE By H U Rahman Page 60&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Mikaberidze| first = Alexander| title = Conflict and Conquest in the Islamic World A Historical Encyclopedia [2 volumes] A Historical Encyclopedia| url = https://books.google.com/?id=jBBYD2J2oE4C&amp;pg=PA836| year = 2011| publisher = ABC-CLIO| isbn = 978-1-59884-337-8| page = 836 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Sandler| first = Stanley| title = Ground Warfare An International Encyclopedia| url = https://books.google.com/?id=L_xxOM85bD8C&amp;pg=PA602| accessdate = 2013-04-30| year = 2002| publisher = ABC-CLIO| isbn = 978-1-57607-344-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 'Ali protested, stating that it was contrary to the Qur'an and the [[Sunnah]] and hence not binding. Then he tried to organise a new army, but only the [[Ansar (Islam)|Ansar]], the remnants of the Qurra led by [[Malik Ashtar]], and a few of their clansmen remained loyal.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt; This put Ali in a weak position even amongst his own supporters.&lt;ref name="autogenerated17"/&gt; The arbitration resulted in the dissolution of 'Ali's coalition, and some have opined that this was Muawiyah's intention.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See:

The most vociferous opponents in Ali's camp were the very same people who had forced Ali into the ceasefire. They broke away from Ali's force, rallying under the slogan "arbitration belongs to God alone." This group came to be known as the [[Kharijites]] ("those who leave"). They considered everyone to be their enemy. In 659 Ali's forces and the [[Kharijites]] met in the [[Battle of Nahrawan]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated16"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated16"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Timani, Hussam S. (2008). Modern Intellectual Readings of the Kharijites. Peter Lang. p. 62. {{ISBN|978-0-8204-9701-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google62"&gt;{{cite book| last = Timani| first = Hussam S.| title = Modern Intellectual Readings of the Kharijites| url = https://books.google.com/?id=F2F92guvrgAC&amp;pg=PA62| year = 2008| publisher = Peter Lang| isbn = 978-0-8204-9701-3| page = 62 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Qurra then became known as the [[Kharijites]]. The Kharijites then started killing Ali's supporters and other Muslims. They considered anyone who was not part of their group as an unbeliever.&lt;ref name="google62"/&gt; Although 'Ali won the battle by a huge margin, the constant conflict had begun to affect his standing.&lt;ref name="autogenerated16"/&gt; While dealing with the Iraqis, 'Ali found it hard to build a disciplined army and effective state institutions. He also spent a lot of time fighting the [[Kharijites]]. As a result, 'Ali found it hard to expand the state on its eastern front.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;A Chronology of Islamic History 570–1000 By H. U. Rahman&lt;/ref&gt;

At about the same time, unrest was brewing in Egypt. The governor of Egypt, Qais, was recalled, and Ali had him replaced with [[Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr]] (the brother of Aisha and the son of Islam's first caliph Abu Bakr). Muawiyah allowed [['Amr ibn al-'As]] to conquer Egypt and 'Amr did so successfully.&lt;ref name="autogenerated18"&gt;A Chronology of Islamic History 570–1000 By H. U. Rahman Page 62&lt;/ref&gt; Amr had first taken Egypt eighteen years earlier from the Romans but had been dismissed by Uthman.&lt;ref name="autogenerated18"/&gt; [[Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr]] had no popular support in Egypt and managed to get together 2000 men but they dispersed without a fight.&lt;ref name="autogenerated18"/&gt;

In the following years, Muawiyah's army occupied many cities of Iraq, which Ali's governors could not prevent, and people did not support him to fight with them. Muawiyah overpowered Egypt, [[Hijaz]], Yemen and other areas.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Harvnb|Madelung|1997|pp=267–269 and 293–307}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In the last year of Ali's caliphate, the mood in Kufa and Basra changed in his favour as the people became disillusioned with Muawiyah's reign and policies. However, the people's attitude toward Ali differed deeply. Just a small minority of them believed that Ali was the best Muslim after Muhammad and the only one entitled to rule them, while the majority supported him due to their distrust and opposition to Muawiyah.&lt;ref name="Madelung 1997 p=309"&gt;{{Harvnb|Madelung|1997|p=309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Policies===
==== Anti-corruption campaign and egalitarian policies ====
Ali is said to have vowed and forewarned of an uncompromising campaign against financial corruption and unfair privileges in the ranks of the caliphate after he was pressed by the public to succeed the caliphate following [[Siege of Uthman|the death of Uthman]]. Shias argue that his determination in pushing these reforms despite their unpopularity with the elite have been the cause of hostilities from the rich and the privileged former companions of the Prophet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.al-islam.org/imam-ali-s-book-government-ayatullah-muhammadi-rayshahri/politics-two-schools#alawi-politics|title=Politics in two Schools|website=Al-Islam.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imamreza.net/eng/imamreza.php?id=10495|title=Hazrat Ali (A.S.): His Poor Subjects and Pro-Poor Government {{!}}{{!}} Imam Reza (A.S.)

&lt;blockquote&gt;Remember that displeasure and disapproval of common men, have-nots and depressed persons more than overbalances the approval of important persons and displeasure of a few big will be excused by the Lord if the general public and masses of your subjects are happy with you. The common men, the poor, apparently less important sections of your subjects are the pillars of Islam….be more friendly with them and secure their confidence and sympathy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
'Ali recovered the land granted by 'Uthman and swore to recover anything that elites had acquired before his election. Ali opposed the centralisation of capital control over provincial revenues, favouring an equal distribution of [[Islamic tax|taxes]] and booty amongst the Muslim citizens; he distributed the entire revenue of the [[Bayt al-mal|treasury]] among them. 'Ali refrained from [[nepotism]], including with his brother '[[Aqeel ibn Abu Talib]]. This was an indication to Muslims of his policy of offering equality to Muslims who served Islam in its early years and to the Muslims who played a role in the later [[Muslim conquests|conquests]].&lt;ref name="Iranica" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See:
* {{Harvnb|Lapidus|2002|p=46}}
* {{Harvnb|Madelung|1997|p=150 and 264}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Forming coalitions ====
Ali succeeded in forming a broad coalition, especially after the [[Battle of the Camel]]. His policy of equal distribution of taxes and booty gained the support of Muhammad's companions, especially the Ansar who were subordinated by the Quraysh leadership after Muhammad, the traditional tribal leaders, and the [[Qari|Qurra]] or Qur'anic reciters that sought pious Islamic leadership. The successful formation of this diverse coalition seems to be due to Ali's charismatic character.&lt;ref name="Iranica" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shaban|1971|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; This diverse coalition became known as ''Shi'a Ali'', meaning "party" or "faction of Ali". However, according to Shia, as well as non-Shia reports, the majority of those who supported 'Ali after his election as caliph, were shia politically, not religiously. Although at this time there were many who were counted as political Shia, few of them believed Ali's religious leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Momen|1985|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Governance doctrine ====
His policies and ideas of governing are manifested in the letter he sent to [[Malik al-Ashtar]] after appointing him governor of Egypt. This instruction, which has historically been viewed as the ideal constitution for Islamic governance alongside the [[Constitution of Medina]], involved detailed description of duties and rights of the ruler and various functionaries of the state and the main classes of society at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shah-Kazemi|2007|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Development Program, Arab human development report, (2002), p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;
Ali wrote in his instructions to Malik al-Ashtar:

{{quote|text=Infuse your heart with mercy, love and kindness for your subjects. Be not in face of them a voracious animal, counting them as easy prey, for they are of two kinds: either they are your brothers in faith or in creation. Error catches them unaware, deficiencies overcome them, (evil deeds) are committed by them intentionally and by mistake. So grant them your pardon and your forgiveness to the same extent that you hope God will grant you His pardon and His forgiveness. For you are above them, and he who appointed you is above you, and God is above him who appointed you. God has sought from you the fulfillment of their requirements and He is trying you with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nasr|Dabashi|Nasr|1989|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Since the majority of 'Ali's subjects were nomads and peasants, he was concerned with agriculture. He instructed to Malik to give more attention to development of the land than to the collection of the tax, because tax can only be obtained by the development of the land and whoever demands tax without developing the land ruins the country and destroys the people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lambton|1991|p=xix and xx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 Ramadan AH 40, which would correspond to 27 January 661, while praying in the [[Great Mosque of Kufa]], Ali was attacked by the [[Kharijite]] [[Abd-al-Rahman ibn Muljam]]. He was wounded by ibn Muljam's poison-coated sword while prostrating in the Fajr prayer.&lt;ref name="Tabatabaei 1979 192"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tabatabaei|1979|p=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'Ali ordered his sons not to attack the Kharijites, instead stipulating that if he survived, ibn Muljam would be pardoned whereas if he died, ibn Muljam should be given only one equal hit (regardless of whether or not he died from the hit).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kelsay|1993|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'Ali died two days later on 29 January 661 (21 Ramadan AH 40).&lt;ref name="Iranica" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tabatabaei 1979 192" /&gt; Al-Hasan fulfilled [[Qisas]] and gave equal punishment to ibn Muljam upon Ali's death.&lt;ref name="Madelung 1997 p=309" /&gt;

After Ali's death, Kufi Muslims pledged allegiance to his eldest son Hasan without dispute, as Ali on many occasions had declared that just [[Ahl al-Bayt|People of the House]] of Muhammad were entitled to rule the Muslim community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Madelung|1997|p=313 and 314}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At this time, Muawiyah held both the Levant and Egypt and, as commander of the largest force in the Muslim Empire, had declared himself caliph and marched his army into Iraq, the seat of Hasan's caliphate.

War ensued during which Muawiyah gradually subverted the generals and commanders of Hasan's army with large sums of money and deceiving promises until the army rebelled against him. Finally, Hasan was forced to make peace and to yield the caliphate to Muawiyah. In this way Muawiyah captured the Islamic caliphate and tuned it to a secular kingdom ([[Sultanate]]). Umayyad caliphate later became a centralised monarchy by [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Madelung|1997|pp=319–325}}

* {{Harvnb|Holt|Lambton|Lewis|1970|pp=74–76}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Umayyads placed the severest pressure upon Ali's family and his [[Shia]], in every way possible. Regular public cursing of Imam Ali in the [[Salat#Prayer in congregation|congregational prayers]] remained a vital institution which was not abolished until 60 years later by [[Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz]]. 
&lt;ref name="Madelung 1997 334"/&gt;

Madelung writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Umayyad highhandedness, misrule and repression were gradually to turn the minority of Ali's admirers into a majority. In the memory of later generations Ali became the ideal [[Commander of the Faithful]]. In face of the fake Umayyad claim to legitimate sovereignty in Islam as God's Vice-regents on earth, and in view of Umayyad treachery, arbitrary and divisive government, and vindictive retribution, they came to appreciate his [Ali's] honesty, his unbending devotion to the reign of Islam, his deep personal loyalties, his equal treatment of all his supporters, and his generosity in forgiving his defeated enemies.&lt;ref name="Madelung 1997 p=309 and 310"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Ibn Abi'l-Hadid]] narrates the following about the Umayyad treatment towards Ali and his followers:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Everybody knows that when the Umayyads held the reins of the Islamic world, they spared no single effort for extinguishing the light of Ali and inventing ﬂaws against him. Moreover, they issued the decisions of cursing him openly from the mimbars of their mosques and sentenced to death anyone who would mention any of his incalculable merits. They also prevented people from reporting any narration that might refer to any of his accolades. Finally, they even prevented people from calling their newborns by his name."&lt;ref name= "Al Abbas"/&gt;{{rp|6}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Burial in Najaf===
[[File:Imam ali's shrine, Arbaeen 2015.JPG|thumb|Ali's [[shrine]] in [[Arbaeen]] 2015.]]
[[File:Mazar-e sharif - Steve Evans.jpg|thumb|[[Rawze-e-Sharif]], the Blue Mosque, in [[Mazari Sharif]], Afghanistan – where a minority of Muslims believe Ali ibn [[Abu Talib ibn Abd al-Muttalib|Abu Talib]] is buried.]]
According to [[Al-Shaykh Al-Mufid]], Ali did not want his grave to be desecrated by his enemies and consequently asked his friends and family to bury him secretly. This secret gravesite was revealed later during the Abbasid caliphate by [[Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq]], his descendant and the sixth Shia Imam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Al-Shaykh Al-Mufid|1986|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Shias accept that Ali is buried at the Tomb of Imam Ali in the [[Imam Ali Mosque]] at what is now the city of [[Najaf]], which grew around the mosque and shrine called Masjid Ali.&lt;ref name="Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib"&gt;{{Harvnb|Redha|1999|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Medieval"/&gt;

However another story, usually maintained by some Afghans, notes that his body was taken and buried in the Afghan city of [[Mazar-E-Sharif]] at the famous Blue Mosque or [[Rawze-e-Sharif]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/cities/afghanistan/balkh.html|title=Silk Road Seattle - Balkh|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303175438/http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/cities/afghanistan/balkh.html|archivedate=March 3, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Virtues==
{{See also|Nahj al-Balagha}}
Ali is respected not only as a warrior and leader, but as a writer and religious authority. A numerous range of disciplines from [[Kalam|theology]] and [[Tafsir|exegesis]] to [[Calligraphy#Islamic|calligraphy]] and [[numerology]], from [[Shariah|law]] and mysticism to [[Arabic grammar]] and [[rhetoric]] are regarded as having been first adumbrated by Ali.&lt;ref name="Medieval"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2006|title='Ali ibn Abu Talib|encyclopedia=Medieval Islamic Civilization: An Encyclopedia|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|last=Shah-Kazemi|first=Reza|isbn=978-0-415-96691-7}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2008-04-02 --&gt;, Pages 36 and 37&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prophetic knowledge ===
According to a ''hadith'' which is narrated by Shia and Sufis, Muhammad told about him "I'm the city of knowledge and Ali is its gate&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name="Medieval" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Momen|1985|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiritualfoundation.net/sayingsofhadratali.htm|title=Spiritual Foundation|website=www.spiritualfoundation.net|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216201058/http://www.spiritualfoundation.net/sayingsofhadratali.htm|archivedate=16 February 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muslims regard Ali as a major authority on Islam. According to the Shia, Ali himself gave this testimony:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Not a single [[Ayah|verse]] of the Quran [[Wahy|descended]] upon (was revealed to) the Messenger of God which he did not proceed to dictate to me and make me [[Qira'at|recite]]. I would [[Mushaf|write it with my own hand]], and he would instruct me as to its ''tafsir'' (the literal explanation) and the ''[[ta'wil]]'' (the spiritual exegesis), the ''[[Naskh (tafsir)|nasikh]]'' (the verse which abrogates) and the ''[[mansukh]]'' (the abrogated verse), the ''[[Muhkam (tafsir)|muhkam]]'' and the ''[[mutashabih]]'' (the fixed and the ambiguous), the particular and the general&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Corbin|1993|p=46}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;It has been narrated that when [[Abbas ibn Ali|Abbas]] was a baby, Ali placed him on his lap, kissed his hands an began to weep. He foretold the tragedy of Abbas and the inevitable fate of his hands which caused his wife, [[Umm ul-Banin]], to also weep. However, he goes on to describe Abbas's future position and great status with God, and this relieves her.&lt;ref name="Al Abbas" /&gt;

=== Theosophy ===
According to [[Seyyed Hossein Nasr]], Ali is credited with having established [[Kalam|Islamic theology]] and his quotations contain the first rational proofs among Muslims of the [[Tawhid|Unity of God]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nasr|2006|p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ibn Abi al-Hadid]] has quoted
&lt;blockquote&gt;As for theosophy and dealing with matters of divinity, it was not an Arab art. Nothing of the sort had been circulated among their distinguished figures or those of lower ranks. This art was the exclusive preserve of Greece, whose sages were its only expounders. The first one among Arabs to deal with it was Ali.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nasr|Dabashi|Nasr|1996|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In later [[Islamic philosophy]], especially in the teachings of [[Mulla Sadra]] and his followers, like Allameh Tabatabaei, Ali's sayings and sermons were increasingly regarded as central sources of metaphysical knowledge, or divine philosophy. Members of [[Transcendent Theosophy|Sadra's school]] regard Ali as the supreme metaphysician of Islam.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; According to Henry Corbin, the ''[[Nahj al-Balagha]]'' may be regarded as one of the most important sources of doctrines professed by Shia thinkers, especially after 1500. Its influence can be sensed in the logical co-ordination of terms, the deduction of correct conclusions, and the creation of certain technical terms in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] which entered the literary and [[Philosophy|philosophical language]] independently of the translation into Arabic of [[Greek language|Greek]] texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Corbin|1993|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, some hidden or occult sciences such as ''[[Al-Jafr (book)|jafr]]'', Islamic [[numerology]], and the science of the symbolic significance of the letters of the [[Arabic alphabet]], are said to have been established by Ali&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; through his having studied the texts of [[Al-Jafr (book)|al-Jafr]] and [[al-Jamia]].

===Eloquence===
Ali was also a great scholar of [[Arabic literature]] and pioneered in the field of Arabic grammar and rhetoric. Numerous short sayings of Ali have become part of general Islamic culture and are quoted as aphorisms and proverbs in daily life. They have also become the basis of literary works or have been integrated into poetic verse in many languages. Already in the 8th century, literary authorities such as [['Abd al-Hamid ibn Yahya al-'Amiri]] pointed to the unparalleled eloquence of Ali's sermons and sayings, as did [[al-Jahiz]] in the following century.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; Even staffs in the [[Divan]] of Umayyad recited Ali's sermons to improve their eloquence.&lt;ref&gt;"حفظت سبعين خطبة من خطب الاصلع ففاضت ثم فاضت ) ويعني بالاصلع أمير المؤمنين عليا عليه السلام " [http://books.rafed.net/turathona/5/ts2.html مقدمة في مصادر نهج البلاغة] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150617233159/http://books.rafed.net/turathona/5/ts2.html |date=June 17, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous selection of Ali's utterances and writings has been gathered in a book called ''[[Nahj al-Balagha]]'' (''Peak of Eloquence'') by a 10th-century Shia scholar, [[Al-Sharif al-Radi]], who selected them for their singular rhetorical beauty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamology.com/Resources/Nahj_Imam/Sermons/bookE/sources.htm Sources of Nahj Al-Balagha] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121123072458/http://www.islamology.com/Resources/Nahj_Imam/Sermons/bookE/sources.htm |date=November 23, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The sermons without dots and alephs====
Of note among sermons quoted in the book, is the undotted sermon as well as the sermon without [[Aleph]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=|title=Sermons without 'dot's and 'Alef'|url=https://www.tasnimnews.com/fa/news/1396/01/16/1370272/%D8%AE%D8%B7%D8%A8%D9%87-%D8%A8%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%86-%D9%86%D9%82%D8%B7%D9%87-%D8%A7%D9%85%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%A4%D9%85%D9%86%DB%8C%D9%86-%D8%B9?ref=shahrekhabar|accessdate=6 April 2017|language=fa|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170406202149/https://www.tasnimnews.com/fa/news/1396/01/16/1370272/%D8%AE%D8%B7%D8%A8%D9%87-%D8%A8%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%86-%D9%86%D9%82%D8%B7%D9%87-%D8%A7%D9%85%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%A4%D9%85%D9%86%DB%8C%D9%86-%D8%B9?ref=shahrekhabar|archivedate=April 6, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to narrations, some companions of [[Muhammad]] had gathered somewhere discussing the role of [[Letter (alphabet)|letters]] in speaking. They concluded that Aleph had the greatest contribution in speaking and that dotted letters were also important. Meanwhile, Ali read two long impromptu sermons, one without using Aleph letter and the other without dotted letters, containing deep and eloquent concepts, according to Langroudi, a Shia author.&lt;ref name="EhsaniFar"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ehsani far langroudi|first1=Mohammad|title=Two masterpieces by Ali|journal=Hadith Sciences|date=2003|issue=29|url=http://www.hadith.net/post/4174/%D8%AF%D9%88-%D8%B4%D8%A7%D9%87%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%88%D9%8A/|accessdate=9 April 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170410052212/http://www.hadith.net/post/4174/%D8%AF%D9%88-%D8%B4%D8%A7%D9%87%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%88%D9%8A/|archivedate=April 10, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Jordac]], a [[Christian]] author, said that sermons without Aleph and dot had to be regarded as literary masterpiece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sermons without dot/ Christian George Jordac: This sermon is a masterpiece|url=http://www.khabaronline.ir/detail/218098/culture/religion|website=www.khabaronline.ir|accessdate=9 April 2017|language=fa|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428100751/http://www.khabaronline.ir/detail/218098/culture/religion|archivedate=April 28, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Compassion ===
Ali is revered for the deep sympathy and support he shown for the poor and orphans, and the egalitarian policies he pursued during his caliphate with aim of achieving social justice. He is quoted as saying:
&lt;blockquote&gt;If God grants wealth and prosperity to any person, he should show kindness to his deserving kith and kin, should provide for the poor, should come the assistance of those are oppressed with calamities, misfortunes and reverses, should help the poor and have-nots and should assist honest people to liquidate their loans...&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is narrated in [[Kitab al-Kafi]] that [[Amir al-Mu'minin]] Ali ibn Abi Talib was presented with honey and figs from locations near Baghdad. Upon receiving the gifts, he ordered his officers to bring the orphans so that they can lick the honey from the containers while he distributed the rest himself among the people. &lt;ref name="Kulayni"/&gt;

===Works===
[[File:Quran by Imam ali.JPG|thumb|One of the first copies of the [[Qur'an]] ever transcribed in the Islamic world by 'Ali ibn Abi Talib.]]

The compilation of sermons, lectures and quotations attributed to Ali are compiled in the form of several books.
* ''[[Nahj al-Balagha]]'' (Peak of Eloquence) contains eloquent sermons, letters and quotations attributed to Ali which is compiled by [[Sharif Razi|ash-Sharif ar-Radi]] (d. 1015). Reza Shah Kazemi states: "Despite ongoing questions about the authenticity of the text, recent scholarship suggests that most of the material in it can in fact be attributed to Ali" and in support of this he makes reference to an article by Mokhtar Jebli.&lt;ref name="Medieval"/&gt; This book has a prominent position in [[Arabic literature]]. It is also considered an important intellectual, political and religious work in Islam.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Muta97"&gt;Mutahhari, 1997 [http://www.al-islam.org/al-tawhid/general-al-tawhid/selection-glimpses-nahj-al-balaghah-mutahhari/introduction The Glimpses of Nahj al Balaghah Part I – Introduction]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shah-Kazemi|2007|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Urdu]] translator of Nahjul Balagha Syed Zeeshan Haider Jawadi&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =| first =|authorlink = Sharif Razi (Urdu Translation by Syed Zeeshan Haider Jawadi)| title = [[Nahj al-Balagha]]| publisher = Tanzeem-ul-Makatib, Lucknow and Mahfooz Book Agency  Karachi | series = | volume =| edition = Second April 2000 | date = | location = Karachi | pages =9–12 | language =Urdu, Arabic | url =| doi = | id = | isbn =| mr =| zbl =| jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt; has compiled a list of 61 books and name of their writers from [[Hijri year|AH]] 204 to 488, and provided the sources in which compilation work of Sharif Razi can be traced out.

It includes the Nahj al-balagha and other discourses which were not incorporated by ash-Sharif ar-Radi or were not available to him. Apparently, except for some of the aphorisms, the original sources of all the contents of the Nahj al-balagha have been determined.&lt;ref name="Muta97"/&gt; There are several ''Comments on the Peak of Eloquence'' by Sunnis and Shias such as [[Comments on the Peak of Eloquence (Ibn Abu al-Hadid)|Comments of Ibn Abi al-Hadid]] and [[Peak of Eloquence with comments (Muhammad Abduh)|comments of Muhammad Abduh]].

* ''Ghurar al-Hikam wa Durar al-Kalim'' (Exalted aphorisms and Pearls of Speech) which is compiled by [[Abd al-Wahid Amidi]] (d. 1116) consists of over ten thousand short sayings of Ali.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shah-Kazemi|2007|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Descendants==
{{Main|Descendants of Ali ibn Abi Talib|Alavi (surname)}}

Ali initially married Fatimah, who was his most beloved wife. After she died, he got married again.  He had four children with [[Fatimah]], [[Hasan ibn Ali]], [[Husayn ibn Ali]], [[Zaynab bint Ali]]&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; and [[Umm Kulthum bint Ali]]. His other well-known sons were [[al-Abbas ibn Ali]], born to [[Fatima binte Hizam]] (Um al-Banin), and [[Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stearns|Langer|2001|p=1178}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah was Ali's son from another wife from Hanifa clan of central Arabia named [[Khawlah bint Ja'far]]. After Fatima's death, Ali married Khawla bint Ja'far of the Bani Hanifa tribe.

Hasan, born in 625, was the second Shia Imam and he also occupied the outward function of caliph for about six months. In the year AH 50 he was poisoned and killed by a member of his own household who, as has been accounted by historians, had been motivated by Mu'awiyah.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tabatabaei|1979|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Husayn, born in 626, was the third Shia Imam. He lived under severe conditions of suppression and persecution by Mu'awiyah. On the tenth day of [[Muharram]], of the year 680, he lined up before the army of the caliph with his small band of followers and nearly all of them were killed in the [[Battle of Karbala]]. The anniversary of his death is called the [[Day of Ashura]] and it is a day of mourning and religious observance for Shia Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tabatabaei|1979|pp=196–201}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this battle some of Ali's other sons were killed. [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|Al-Tabari]] has mentioned their names in his history: Al-Abbas ibn Ali, the holder of Husayn's standard, Ja'far, Abdallah and Uthman, the four sons born to Fatima binte Hizam; Muhammad and Abu Bakr. The death of the last one is doubtful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Al-Tabari|1990|pp=vol.XIX pp. 178–179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some historians have added the names of Ali's other sons who were killed at Karbala, including Ibrahim, Umar and Abdallah ibn al-Asqar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aashura.tripod.com/martyrs.htm|title=Karbala's Martyrs|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104202432/http://aashura.tripod.com/martyrs.htm|archivedate=January 4, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.velaiat.com/shshow.asp?rsabs=43&amp;id=kash List of Martyrs of Karbala] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629162138/http://www.velaiat.com/shshow.asp?rsabs=43&amp;id=kash |date=June 29, 2012 }} by Khansari "فرزندان اميراالمؤمنين(ع):

His daughter Zaynab—who was in Karbala—was captured by Yazid's army and later played a great role in revealing what happened to Husayn and his followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Zaynab Bint ʿAlĪ|year=2004|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Religion|accessdate=2008-04-10|publisher=Gale Group|url=http://www.bookrags.com/research/zaynab-bint-al-eorl-14/|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224023158/http://www.bookrags.com/research/zaynab-bint-al-eorl-14/|archivedate=December 24, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ali's descendants by Fatimah are known as ''[[sharif]]s'', ''sayeds'' or ''[[sayyid]]s''. These are honorific titles in Arabic, ''sharif'' meaning 'noble' and ''sayed'' or ''sayyid'' meaning 'lord' or 'sir'. As Muhammad's only descendants, they are respected by both Sunni and Shia.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;

==Views==

===Muslim views===
{{Main|Ali in Muslim culture}}
	
Except for Muhammad, there is no one in Islamic history about whom as much has been written in Islamic languages as Ali.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; In [[Islamic culture|Muslim culture]], Ali is respected for his courage, knowledge, belief, honesty, unbending devotion to Islam, deep loyalty to Muhammad, equal treatment of all Muslims and generosity in forgiving his defeated enemies, and therefore is central to mystical traditions in Islam such as [[Sufism]]. Ali retains his stature as an authority on [[Tafsir|Quranic exegesis]], [[Fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]] and religious thought.&lt;ref name="Madelung 1997 p=309 and 310"&gt;{{Harvnb|Madelung|1997|p=309 and 310}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ali holds a high position in almost all Sufi orders which trace their lineage through him to Muhammad. Ali's influence has been important throughout [[Muslim history|Islamic history]].&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; [[Sunni]] and [[Shia]] scholars agree that [[The Verse of Wilayah|the verse of Wilayah]] was narrated in honour of Ali, but there are differing interpretations of ''[[wilayah]]'' and the ''[[Imamate]]''.{{sfnp|Rizvi|Saeed|1988|p=24}} The Sunni scholars believe that the verse is about Ali but does not recognise him as an [[Imam]] while, in the Shia Muslim view, Ali had been chosen by God as successor of Muhammad.{{sfnp|Steigerwald|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=xUu04ozMXOcC&amp;pg=PA375 375]}}

====Ali in the Quran====
{{main|Ali in the Quran}}

There are many verses interpreted by Shi'a scholars as referring to Ali or other [[Shi'a]] [[Imam]]s. Responding to this question that why the names of the Imams are not mentioned in Quran expressly [[Muhammad al-Baqir]] answers: "Allah revealed [[Salat]] to his Prophet but never said of three or four [[Rakat]]s, revealed [[Zakat]] but did not mention to its details, revealed [[Hajj]] but did not count its [[Tawaf]] and the Prophet interpreted their details.

According to Ali one quarter of Qur'anic verses are stating the station of Imams. Momen has listed many of these verses in his ''An Introduction to Shi'i Islam''.&lt;ref name="Leaman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Momen|1985|pp=150–151}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are few verses that some Sunni commentators interpret as referring to Ali, among which are [[The verse of Wilayah]] ([http://tanzil.net/#5:55 Quran, 5:55]) that Sunni and Shiite scholars {{efn|See at-Tabari: at-Tarikh, vol.6, p.186; as-Suyuti: ad-Durru 'lmanthur, vol.2, pp. 293–4; ar-Razi: at-Tafsiru 'l Kabir, vol.12, p.26: az-Zamakhshari: at-Tafsir al-Kashshaf, vol.1, p.469; al-Jassas:Ahkamu 'l-Quran, vol.2, pp. 542–3; al-khazin: at-Tafsir, vol.2, p.68 Imamate: The vicegerency of the Holy Prophet By Sayyid Saeed Akhtar Rizv p24 }} believe refers to the incident where Ali gave his ring to a beggar who asked for [[alms]] while performing [[Salat|ritual prayers]] in the [[mosque]].{{sfnp|Rizvi|Saeed|1988|p=24}}&lt;ref name="CornilleConway2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Cornille, Catherine|author2=Conway, Christopher|title=Interreligious Hermeneutics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZpcNBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT124|date=1 July 2010|publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers|isbn=978-1-63087-425-4|pages=124–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[The verse of Mawadda]] ([http://tanzil.net/#42:23 Quran, 42:23]) is another verse which Shiite scholar along with Sunni ones like [[Al-Baydawi]] and [[Al-Zamakhshari]] and [[Fakhr ad-Din ar-Razi]] believe that the phrase Kinship refers to Ali, [[Fatimah]] and their sons, [[Hasan ibn Ali|Hasan]] and [[Husayn ibn Ali|Husayn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Momen|1985|p=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mavani"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hamid|first1=Mavani|title=Religious Authority and Political Thought in Twelver Shi'ism|pp=68–73|date=2013|publisher=New York and London: Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-62440-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Al-Bidāya wa-n-nihāya | publisher=Dar al-kotob al-Elmie | author=[[Ibn Kathir]] | volume=5 | page=245}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=[[Tafsir al-Tabari]] | publisher=Dar al-fekr Publication | author=[[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari]] | volume=13 | page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bab al-Nasr in 2017, photo by Hatem Moushir 26.jpg|thumb|Ali's Sword and shield carved on Bab al-Nasr gate wall, Cairo]] 
The Shia regard Ali as the most important figure after Muhammad&lt;ref name="TIO20110610"&gt;{{cite web| title = Yawm-e Ali| publisher = TheIsmaili.org| date = 2011-06-10| url = http://www.theismaili.org/festival/yawm-e-ali| accessdate = 2011-06-10}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and he represents a complex, legendary figure in their memory. He is a paragon of virtues, such as courage, magnanimity, sincerity, straightforwardness, eloquence and profound knowledge. Ali was righteous but suffered injustice, he was authoritative but also compassionate and humble, vigorous but also patient, learned but also man of labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fH1pvM0AdNIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA38#v=onepage&amp;q=ali%20courage&amp;f=false|title=Visualizing Belief and Piety in Iranian Shiism|last=Flaskerud|first=Ingvild|date=2010-12-02|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=9781441149077|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Shia, Muhammad suggested on various occasions during his lifetime that Ali should be the leader of Muslims after his death. This is supported by numerous hadiths which have been narrated by Shias, including [[Hadith of the pond of Khumm]], [[Hadith of the two weighty things]], [[Hadith of the pen and paper]], [[Hadith of the Cloak]], [[Hadith of position]], [[Hadith of the invitation of the close families]], and [[Hadith of the Twelve Successors]].

[[Ja'far al-Sadiq]] narrates in hadith that whatever virtue found in [[Muhammad]] was found in Ali, turning away from his guidance would be akin to turning away from Allah and his Prophet. Ali himself narrates that he is the gateway and supervisor to reach Allah. &lt;ref name="Kulayni"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Al-Kulayni |first1=Abu Ja’far Muhammad ibn Ya’qub |title=Kitab al-Kafi |date=2015 |publisher=The Islamic Seminary Inc. |location=South Huntington, NY |isbn=9780991430864 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.
 
According to this view, Ali as the successor of Muhammad not only ruled over the community in justice, but also interpreted the [[Sharia]] Law and its [[Esoteric interpretation of the Quran|esoteric meaning]]. Hence he was regarded as being free from error and sin ([[Infallible#Islamic Beliefs|infallible]]), and appointed by God by divine decree ([[Nass (Islam)|nass]]) through Muhammad.&lt;ref name="Nasr 1979 10"&gt;{{Harvnb|Nasr|1979|p=10}} preface&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed in Twelver and [[Ismaili]] Shīa Islam that [[Aql (Shiasm)|'aql]], divine wisdom, was the source of the souls of the Prophets and Imams and gave them esoteric knowledge called ''ḥikmah'' and that their sufferings were a means of divine grace to their devotees.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nasr|1979|p=15}} preface&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Corbin|1993|pp=45–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Imam was not the recipient of a [[wahy|divine revelation]], he had a close relationship with God, through which God guides him, and the Imam in turn guides the people.  His [[Sunnah|words and deeds]] are a guide and model for the community to follow; as a result it is a [[Sources of sharia law|source of sharia law]].&lt;ref name="Nasr 1979 10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Imamat"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia = Encyclopaedia of Islam and the Muslim world; vol.1 |last = Gleave|first = Robert|title=Imamate|publisher = MacMillan|isbn = 0-02-865604-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Momen|1985|p=174}} preface&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Shia pilgrims usually go to [[Mashad Ali]] in Najaf for [[Ziyarat]], pray there and read "[[Ziyarat Amin Allah]]"&lt;ref&gt;Trust, p. 695&lt;/ref&gt; or other ''Ziyaratnamehs''.&lt;ref&gt;Trust, p. 681&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Safavid Empire]], his grave became the focus of much devoted attention, exemplified in the pilgrimage made by [[Shah Ismail I]] to [[Najaf]] and [[Karbala]].&lt;ref name="Islam"/&gt;

Many Shia Muslims also celebrate Imam Ali's birth anniversary (13th day of [[Rajab]]) as [[Father's Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Iranians to celebrate Father's Day|url=http://www.iran-daily.com/News/190550.html|date=9 April 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian date]] for this changes every year:

====Sunni====
{{Main|Sunni view of Ali}}

Sunnis view Ali as the fourth [[caliph]]. Ali is also known as one of the greatest warrior champions of Islam. Examples include taking on the Quraish champion at the [[Battle of the Trench]] when nobody else dared. After multiple failed attempts of breaking the fort in the [[Battle of Khaybar]], Ali was summoned, miraculously healed and conquered the fort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ali|url=http://www.sunnah.org/publication/khulafa_rashideen/caliph4.htm|publisher=Sunnah|accessdate=14 May 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403090029/http://sunnah.org/publication/khulafa_rashideen/caliph4.htm|archivedate=April 3, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muhammad ibn Idris [[Al-Shafi‘i]], founder of the [[Shafi‘i]] school of [[fiqh]], narrated the following when asked his opinion on Ali:
&lt;blockquote&gt; "What can we say about a person whose partisans have had to hide his merits because of fear, and enemies have hidden his merits out of envy? Nevertheless between these two, his merits that have become widely known are too numerous to be counted."&lt;ref name = "Al Abbas"/&gt;{{rp|6}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Sufi====
Almost all Sufi orders trace their lineage to Muhammad through Ali, an exception being [[Naqshbandi]], who go through Abu Bakr. Even in this order, there is [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]], the great great grandson of Ali. Sufis believe that Ali inherited from Muhammad the saintly power ''[[Wali|wilayah]]'' that makes the [[Sulook|spiritual journey]] to God possible.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;
 
Eminent Sufis such as [[Ali Hujwiri]] claim that the tradition began with Ali and [[Junayd of Baghdad]] regarded Ali as the [[Sheikh]] of the principles and practices of Sufism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alim.org/library/biography/khalifa/content/KAL/79/1 |title=Khalifa Ali bin Abu Talib - Ali, The Father of Sufism |publisher=Alim.org |accessdate=2013-12-31 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113035327/http://www.alim.org/library/biography/khalifa/content/KAL/79/1 |archivedate=November 13, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Sufis recite ''[[Manqabat]]'' Ali in the praise of Ali.

====Titles====
'Ali is known by various titles, some given due to his personal qualities and others due to events in his life:&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;
*''[[Murtaza|Al-Murtaza]]'' ({{lang-ar|الـمُـرتـضى}}, "The Chosen One")
*''Amir al-Mu'minin'' ({{lang-ar|أَمـيـر الـمُـؤمـنـيـن}}, "Commander of the Faithful Ones")
*''Bab-e Madinatul-'Ilm'' ({{lang-ar|بَـابِ مَـديـنـةُ الـعِـلـم}}, "Door of City of the Knowledge")
*''[[Abu Turab]]'' ({{lang-ar|أَبـو تُـراب}}, "Father of the Soil")
*''Asadullah'' ({{lang-ar|أَسَـدُ الله}}, "[[Lion]] of [[God]]")
*''[[Haydar]]'' ({{lang-ar|حَـيـدر}}, "Braveheart" or "Lion")
*''Walad al-Ka'ba'' ({{lang-ar|ولد الکعبه}}, "The baby of Ka'ba")&lt;ref name="Piety"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Flaskerud|first1=Ingvild|title=Visualizing Belief and Piety in Iranian Shiism|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=9781441149077|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fH1pvM0AdNIC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;dq=ali%27s+birth+ka%27ba|accessdate=11 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As a "deity"===
{{Main|Ghulat}}
 
Ali is recorded in some traditions as having forbidden those who sought to worship him in his own lifetime.&lt;ref name="Peters 2003 320–321"&gt;See:
* {{Harvnb|Peters|2003|pp=320–321}}
* {{Harvnb|Halm|2004|pp=154–159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Alawites====
Some groups such as the [[Alawites]] (Arabic: علوية ''Alawīyyah'') are claimed to believe that Ali was God [[Incarnation|incarnate]]. They are described as ''ghulat'' ({{lang-ar|غُلاة}}, "exaggerators") by the majority of Islamic scholars. These groups have, according to traditionalist Muslims, left Islam due to their exaggeration of a human being's praiseworthy traits.&lt;ref name="Peters 2003 320–321"/&gt;

====Ali-Illahism====
In [[Ali-Illahism]], a [[syncretism|syncretic]] religion centres on the belief that there have been successive [[incarnations]] of their [[Deity]] throughout history, and reserves particular reverence for 'Ali, the son-in-law of Muhammad, who is considered one such incarnation.&lt;ref&gt;Layard, Austen Henry, Discoveries in the Ruins of Nineveh and Babylon, Page 216&lt;/ref&gt;

====Druze====
The [[Druze]], a syncretic religion, believe that God was [[incarnation|incarnated]] in human beings, especially [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]] a descendant of Ali.

==Historiography==
{{See also|Historiography of early Islam}}
The [[primary sources]] for scholarship on the life of Ali are the Qur'an and ''ahadith'', as well as other [[Historiography of early Islam|texts of early Islamic history]]. The extensive [[secondary source]]s include, in addition to works by Sunni and Shī'a Muslims, writings by [[Christian Arabs]], [[Hindus]], and other non-Muslims from the Middle East and Asia and a few works by modern western scholars. However, many of the early Islamic sources are coloured to some extent by a positive or negative bias towards Ali.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;

There had been a common tendency among the earlier western scholars against these narrations and reports gathered in later periods due to their tendency towards later Sunni and Shī'a partisan positions; such scholars regarding them as later fabrications. This leads them to regard certain reported events as inauthentic or irrelevant. [[Leone Caetani]] considered the attribution of historical reports to [['Abd Allah ibn 'Abbas|Ibn Abbas]] and Aisha as mostly fictitious while proffering accounts reported without ''[[isnad]]'' by the early compilers of history like Ibn Ishaq. Wilferd Madelung has rejected the stance of indiscriminately dismissing everything not included in "early sources" and in this approach tendentiousness alone is no evidence for late origin. According to him, Caetani's approach is inconsistent. Madelung and some later historians do not reject the narrations which have been compiled in later periods and try to judge them in the context of history and on the basis of their compatibility with the events and figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Madelung|1997|p=xi, 19 and 20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the rise of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], few books were written and most of the reports had been oral. The most notable work previous to this period is ''[[The Book of Sulaym ibn Qays]]'', written by [[Sulaym ibn Qays]], a companion of Ali who lived before the Abbasid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lawson|2005|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; When paper was introduced to Muslim society, numerous monographs were written between 750 and 950. According to Robinson, at least twenty-one separate monographs have been composed on the Battle of Siffin. [[Abi Mikhnaf]] is one of the most renowned writers of this period who tried to gather all of the reports. 9th and 10th century historians collected, selected and arranged the available narrations. However, most of these monographs do not exist any more except for a few which have been used in later works such as [[History of the Prophets and Kings]] by [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari]] (d.923).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|2003|p=28 and 34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shia of Iraq actively participated in writing monographs but most of those works have been lost. On the other hand, in the 8th and 9th century Ali's descendants such as [[Muhammad al Baqir]] and [[Jafar as Sadiq]] narrated his quotations and reports which have been gathered in Shia hadith books. The later Shia works written after the 10th century are about biographies of [[The Fourteen Infallibles]] and [[Twelve Imams]]. The earliest surviving work and one of the most important works in this field is ''[[Kitab al-Irshad]]'' by [[Shaykh Mufid]] (d. 1022). The author has dedicated the first part of his book to a detailed account of Ali. There are also some books known as ''Manāqib'' which describe Ali's character from a religious viewpoint. Such works also constitute a kind of historiography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-islam.org/message-thaqalayn/general-message-thaqalayn/glance-historiography-shiite-culture-rasul-jafariyan|title=A Glance at Historiography in Shiite Culture|work=Al-Islam.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:BhaiSahibJiArdas.jpg|thumb|200px|Norang Singh, current head of [[Guru Nanak NSJ, Handsworth]], doing Ardās]]
{{Sikh practices}}
The '''Ardās''' ({{lang-pa|ਅਰਦਾਸ}}) is a set [[prayer]] in [[Sikhism]].&lt;ref name="McLeod1990p103"/&gt;&lt;ref name=britgurudwara/&gt; It is a part of worship service in a [[Gurdwara]] (Sikh temple), daily rituals such as the opening the ''[[Guru Granth Sahib]]'' for ''prakash'' (morning light) or closing it for ''sukhasan'' (night bedroom) in larger Gurdwaras, closing of congregational worship in smaller Gurdwaras, rites-of-passages such as with the naming of child or the cremation of a loved one, [[Nitnem|daily prayer]] by devout Sikhs and any significant Sikh ceremonies.&lt;ref name="Cole2004p8"/&gt; 

An Ardas consists of three parts. The first part recites the virtues of the ten Gurus of Sikhism from Guru Nanak to Guru Gobind Singh, starting with lines from ''[[Chandi di Var]]'' from the ''[[Dasam Granth]]''.&lt;ref name="McLeod1990p103"/&gt;&lt;ref name=britgurudwara/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cole2004p8"/&gt; The second part recites the trials and triumphs of the [[Khalsa]] and petition.&lt;ref name=britgurudwara/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cole2004p8"/&gt; The third salutes the divine name.&lt;ref name=britgurudwara/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cole2004p8"/&gt; The first and the third part are set and cannot be changed, while the second part may vary, be shortened and include a supplication such as seeking divine help or blessing in dealing with daily problems, but is usually in agreed form. While it is sung, the audience or the Sikh devotee typically stands, with hands clasped in the folded [[namaste]] gesture, many with bowed headed, with some typically saying "Waheguru" after certain sections.&lt;ref name="McLeod1990p103"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cole2004p8"&gt;{{cite book|author=W. Owen Cole|title=Understanding Sikhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ohYwDwAAQBAJ |year=2004|publisher=Dunedin Academic Press|isbn=978-1-906716-91-2|pages=8, 18, 104, 111–124, 166–175}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=britgurudwara&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/gurdwara Gurdwara], Encyclopaedia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''MacAuliffe, 1909, p. 331''&lt;/ref&gt;

Ardas is attributed to Guru Gobind Singh, the founder of the Khalsa and the 10th Guru of Sikhism.&lt;ref name="McLeod1990p103"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cole2004p8"/&gt;

==Etymology==
The root of the word Ardas is related to the Sanskrit word ''ard'' (अर्द) which means "request, ask, beg".&lt;ref name="Cole2004p8"/&gt; It is also related to the Persian word ''arzdasht'' which means a written "petition made by an inferior to a superior".&lt;ref name="Cole2004p8"/&gt;

==Structure==
The Ardās is usually always done standing up with folded hands and is commonly preceded by the eighth stanza of the fourth [[ashtapadi]] of the bani [[Sukhmani]], beginning ''Tu Thakur Tum Peh Ardaas''. It consists of three parts:
#The beginning of the Ardās is strictly set by the tenth Sikh Guru, [[Guru Gobind Singh]] and may not be altered or omitted. It appears as the opening passage of Var Sri Bhagauti Ji Ki (see [[Chandi di Var]]).&lt;ref name="JacobsenMyrvold2012p237"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Knut A. Jacobsen|author2=Kristina Myrvold|title=Sikhs Across Borders: Transnational Practices of European Sikhs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HtrWKPWBEXEC&amp;pg=PA237|year=2012|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4411-7087-3|pages=237–238}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first part is an invocation from the ''[[Chandi di Var]]'' and recites the virtues of the Sikh Gurus.&lt;ref name=britgurudwara/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cole2004p8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McLeod1990p103"&gt;{{cite book|author=W.H. McLeod|title=Textual Sources for the Study of Sikhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7xIT7OMSJ44C |year=1990|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-56085-4|pages=103–105}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#The second part is several paragraphs recounting Sikh symbols, places or worship and values significant and related to Khalsa.  This may be changed by reciting a "short ardaas". The Sikh devotee may include a personal prayer such as "[[Waheguru]], please bless me in the task that I am about to undertake" when starting a new task, help me with this problem, or add any personal petition for God.&lt;ref name=britgurudwara/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cole2004p8"/&gt; 
#The third salutes the divine name. This part may also not be altered or omitted.&lt;ref name=britgurudwara/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cole2004p8"/&gt; 

The end of the Ardaas (''Nanak Nam Chardi Kala, Tere Bhane Sarbat Da Bala'', "O Nanak, may the Nam (Holy) be ever in ascendance! in Thy will may the good of all prevail!") is also set and may not be altered or omitted.&lt;ref&gt;SRM, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The "Ardās" of Sikhism was first composed by Guru Gobind Singh. He fixed the first eight lines and the last section, and these are considered unalterable in Sikhism. The second section has been fluid, revised extensively and particularly by Tat Khalsa in the 20th century. The Sikh Rahit Maryada has published an approved version of the entire Ardas.&lt;ref name="McLeod1990p103"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cole2004p8"/&gt;

[[File:The punishment of Bessus by Andre Castaigne (1898-1899).jpg|thumb|300px|right|''The Punishment of Bessus'', [[André Castaigne]]]]
'''Bessus''', also known as '''Artaxerxes V''' (died summer 329 BC), was a prominent Persian [[Satrap]] of [[Bactria (satrapy)|Bactria]] in Persia,&lt;ref name=persbes&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heckel|first=Waldemar|title=Who's Who in the Age of Alexander the Great

|doi=10.1002/9780470757604.ch2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later self-proclaimed [[List of kings of Persia|King of Kings of Persia]]. According to classical sources, he killed his predecessor and relative,&lt;ref name=persbes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gershevitch, Ilya; William Bayne Fisher; J.A. Boyle ''The Cambridge History of Iran, Volume 2'' Cambridge University Press 1985 {{ISBN|978-0-521-20091-2}} p.449 [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vRR8dfI7j_kC&amp;pg=PA449&amp;dq=Bessus+relative&amp;num=100&amp;ei=MLW_SZmIEo2ONsDn8NwL]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Darius III]], after the Persian army had been defeated by [[Alexander the Great]].

==Background==
At the [[Battle of Gaugamela]] (1 October 331 BC), in which Alexander defeated Darius III, Bessus commanded the left wing of the [[Persian army]], chiefly composed of warriors from his [[Satrapy]] who had been mobilized before the [[Battle of Issus]]. The envelopment ordered by Darius failed and the Persians lost the battle after hours of fierce fighting. Bessus survived the battle and remained with his king, whose routed army eluded Alexander's forces and spent the winter in [[Ecbatana]]. The next year Darius attempted to flee to Bactria in the east. Bessus, conspiring with fellow satraps, deposed Darius and, according to sources, put him in golden chains. It is not clear whether Bessus was motivated primarily by personal ambition or by disillusionment with Darius as a leader. He may have intended to surrender the deposed king to the [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonians]], but Alexander ordered his forces to continue to pursue the Persians.

According to sources, the panicked conspirators stabbed Darius and left him dying in a cart to be found by a Macedonian soldier. The [[Babylonian Chronicles|Babylonian Chronicle]] known as BCHP 1 indicates this happened in July 330 BC. The site has been identified near modern [[Ahugan, Qaleh Ganj|Ahuan]].

Bessus immediately proclaimed himself King of Kings of Persia and adopted the throne name Artaxerxes (V). His self-proclaimed ascension was justifiable, since the Satrap of Bactria, known as ''Mathišta'', was the Persian noble next in the line of succession to the Persian throne. But since most of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] had [[Wars of Alexander the Great|already been conquered]] and Bessus only ruled over a loose alliance of those provinces not yet occupied by the Macedonians, historians do not generally regard him as an official King of Kings of Persia.

==Capture and execution==
Bessus returned to Bactria and tried to organize resistance among the eastern satrapies. Alexander was forced to move his force to suppress the uprising in 329 BC, entering Bactria by way of the [[Hindu Kush]] which had been left undefended. After burning the crops Bessus fled east, crossing the river Oxus. However his own Bactrian mounted levies deserted ''en masse'', rather than abandon their homeland. Bessus was seized by several of his chieftains who handed him over to the pursuing Macedonians in an isolated village. The Macedonian vanguard was commanded by General [[Ptolemy I Soter |Ptolemy]] who, under orders from Alexander, had the former satrap put in a wooden collar and tied naked to a stake by the road down which the main army was marching.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Lane Fox, page 300 "Alexander the Great", Library of Congress CCN 73-18880&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander questioned Bessus as to why he had betrayed Darius and continued to lead resistance to the Macedonians. Bessus claimed that he had been only one of several nobles who had jointly agreed on the need to dethrone their irresolute king. Unsatisfied by his responses Alexander ordered the prisoner to be whipped and taken to Balkh and then to Hamadan for trial and punishment.

A fellow conspirator against Darius, [[Satibarzanes]] Satrap of [[Aria (region)|Aria]], had already surrendered to Alexander and had been pardoned.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Lane Fox, page 280 "Alexander the Great", Library of Congress CCN 73-18880&lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike Bessus, Satibarzanes had not aspired to the Persian throne. At Hamadan, Alexander ordered that Bessus's nose and earlobes be cut off, which was a Persian custom for those involved in rebellion and [[regicide]]; the [[Behistun inscription]] relates that [[Darius I|Darius the Great]] punished the usurper Phraortes of Media (who was the son of Upadaranma, king of Media) in a similar manner (c. 521 BC).

Ancient reports contradict each other about the nature of Bessus's execution. The historian, [[Quintus Curtius Rufus]], says he was [[crucifixion|crucified]] in the place where Darius had been killed, [[Arrian]] states that he was tortured and then [[decapitate]]d in [[Ecbatana]], and [[Plutarch]] suggests that he was torn apart in [[Bactria]] by recoiling trees after a Macedonian trial, a style which was according to Persian custom: two trees would have been forcibly bent towards each other, the victim tied to both, and then the trees released, causing an agonizing and drawn-out death in which the ligaments, tendons, muscles and organs would slowly come apart as the trees straightened themselves.&lt;ref name="Scott2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Scott|title=From Democrats to Kings: The Brutal Dawn of a New World from the Downfall of Athens to the Rise of Alexan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=96fry3MEp0YC&amp;pg=PT146|date=16 September 2010|publisher=Overlook|isbn=978-1-4683-0280-6|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Billy Graham bw photo, April 11, 1966.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Billy Graham]] in 1966]]
The '''Billy Graham rule''' is a practice among male [[evangelical Protestant]] leaders, in which they avoid spending time alone with women to whom they are not married. It is named after [[Billy Graham]], a proponent of the practice, although recently has also been called the '''Mike Pence rule'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Men at Work Wonder if They Overstepped With Women, Too|first=Nellie|last=Bowles|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/business/men-at-work-wonder-sexual-harassment.html|work=The New York Times|date=November 10, 2017|accessdate=November 10, 2017|quote=Still, some workers said they were starting to follow "the Pence rule," which was formerly known as the Billy Graham rule, after the evangelical preacher, but is now named for Vice President Mike Pence. Mr. Pence has said he does not eat alone with women who are not his wife or attend an event without her if alcohol will be served.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is adopted as a display of integrity, a means of avoiding sexual temptation, and to avoid any appearance of doing something considered morally objectionable, but has been criticized as being [[sexist]].

== Background ==

=== "Billy Graham rule" ===
In 1948, Graham held a series of evangelistic meetings in [[Modesto, California]]. Together with [[Cliff Barrows]], [[Grady B. Wilson|Grady Wilson]] and [[George Beverly Shea]], he resolved to "avoid any situation that would have even the appearance of compromise or suspicion".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Just As I Am|last=Graham|first=Billy|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cKD_mGqVyLcC |publisher=HarperOne|year=1999|isbn=978-0060633929|location=|pages=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accountability agreement, which has become known as the "Modesto Manifesto",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dowland|first=Seth|year=2014|title=The 'Modesto Manifesto'|url=https://www.christianhistoryinstitute.org/magazine/article/the-modesto-manifesto/|journal=Christian History|volume=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; covered not only their interactions with women, but also commitments to integrity with respect to finances, their interactions with local churches, and publicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.thegospelcoalition.org/evangelical-history/2017/03/30/where-did-the-billy-graham-rule-come-from/|title=Where Did the 'Billy Graham Rule' Come From?|date=March 20, 2017|publisher=[[The Gospel Coalition]]|last1=Taylor|first1=Justin|accessdate=April 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time, Graham made a point of not traveling, meeting, or eating alone with a woman other than his wife [[Ruth Graham|Ruth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.wheaton.edu/bgc/archives/faq/4.htm|title=What part did the Modesto Manifesto play in the ministry of Billy Graham?|date=January 31, 2007|website=Billy Graham Center Archives|dead-url=|access-date=May 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graham biographer [[Grant Wacker]] observed that "Over the years Graham received intense media scrutiny, but hardly anyone accused him of violating any of those four principles."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=America's Pastor|last=Wacker|first=Grant|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0674052185|location=|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; By Graham's own admission, though, he was not an absolutist in the application of the rule that now bears his name: his autobiography relates a lunch meeting with [[Hillary Clinton]] that he initially refused on the grounds that he does not eat alone with women other than his wife, but she persuaded him that they could have a private conversation in a public dining room.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/883482847|title=Just As I Am : the Autobiography of Billy Graham.|last=Graham|first=Billy|last2=|first2=|date=1997|publisher=Harper Collins|year=|isbn=9780060633875|location=|pages=651|oclc=883482847}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bltnotjustasandwich.com/2017/03/30/when-hillary-clinton-persuaded-billy-graham-to-break-the-billy-graham-rule/|title=When Hillary Clinton Persuaded Billy Graham to Break the 'Billy Graham Rule'|last=Gayle|first=J.K.|date=March 30, 2017|website=BLT – Bible * Literature * Translation|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Mike Pence rule" ===
[[File:Karen &amp; Mike Pence (33096706126).jpg|thumb|48th Vice President [[Mike Pence]] in 2017, with [[Second Lady]] [[Karen Pence]]]]
In March 2017, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' noted that U.S. Vice President [[Mike Pence]] had adopted a version of this rule, in that he will not have dinner alone with any woman other than his wife [[Karen Pence|Karen]].&lt;ref name="Relevant" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/karen-pence-is-the-vice-presidents-prayer-warrior-gut-check-and-shield/2017/03/28/3d7a26ce-0a01-11e7-8884-96e6a6713f4b_story.html|title=Karen Pence is the vice president's 'prayer warrior,' gut check and shield|last1=Parker|first1=Ashley|date=March 28, 2017|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=April 2, 2017|author-link=Ashley Parker}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/mike-pence-ridiculed-for-practicing-billy-graham-rule-179044/|title=Mike Pence Ridiculed for Practicing 'Billy Graham Rule'|last1=Showalter|first1=Brendan|date=March 30, 2017|work=[[The Christian Post]]|accessdate=April 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emma Green, writing for ''[[The Atlantic]]'', noted that the controversy was an example of how "notions of gender divide American culture": while "socially liberal or non-religious people may see Pence's practice as misogynistic or bizarre", for "a lot of conservative religious people" the "set-up probably sounds normal, or even wise".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/03/pence-wife-billy-graham-rule/521298/|title=How Mike Pence's Marriage Became Fodder for the Culture Wars|last1=Green|first1=Emma|date=March 30, 2017|work=[[The Atlantic]]|accessdate=April 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Employment lawyer Joanna Grossman wrote that the Pence rule, when applied to workplace dinners, could be illegal labor discrimination under Title VII of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2017/3/31/15132730/pence-women-alone-rule-graham-discrimination|title=Vice President Pence's "never dine alone with a woman" rule isn't honorable.

== Reactions ==
The rule has been criticized for viewing women merely as potential objects of lust as well as restricting opportunities for women to network with male colleagues.&lt;ref name=Relevant&gt;{{cite news|title=Twitter Tangles With the Billy Graham Rule|url=https://relevantmagazine.com/slice/twitter-tangles-with-the-billy-graham-rule/|accessdate=April 2, 2017|work=[[Relevant (magazine)|Relevant]]|date=March 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Turner|first1=Laura|title=The religious reasons Mike Pence won't eat alone with women don't add up|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2017/03/30/the-religious-reasons-mike-pence-wont-eat-alone-with-women-dont-add-up|accessdate=April 2, 2017|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=March 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tracey Bianchi argues that it means "Women are marginalized and cut out of opportunities to network, share their ideas, and advance in the organization."&lt;ref name=Bianchi&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bianchi|first1=Tracey|title=Ladies Who Lunch—with Men|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/women-leaders/2016/june/ladies-who-lunch-with-men.html?paging=off|accessdate=April 2, 2017|work=[[Christianity Today]]|date=June 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bianchi also argues that the rule conflicts with the practice of Jesus himself, who spent time alone with the [[Samaritan woman at the well]].&lt;ref name=Bianchi /&gt;

Ty Grigg suggests that the rule has not been "effective at curbing infidelity". He argues that the rule "has framed relating with the opposite sex with fear", and that this leads to a diminished mutual respect, which in turn creates "the kind of environment where inappropriate relating is more likely to occur".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grigg|first1=Ty|title=How I Learned to Stop Worrying About the Billy Graham Rule and Love Like Jesus|url=http://www.missioalliance.org/how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-about-the-billy-graham-rule-and-love-like-jesus/|accessdate=April 2, 2017|agency=Missio Alliance|date=July 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, though, suggest that unfaithful pastors must have failed to implement the rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Russell|first1=Bob|title=After 50 Years of Ministry: 7 Things I'd Do Differently and 7 Things I'd Do the Same|date=2016|publisher=[[Moody Publishers]]|page=84|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-s6UCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT84|accessdate=April 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Brown observes that criticism against the rule has misunderstood the purposes of the rule.  He argues that the rule prevents third parties from suspecting that an illicit romantic relationship exists (avoiding the appearance of evil).  It also protects against any future accusations should the other party become embittered and seek to attack the innocent boss.  Finally, it does protect both parties from developing natural attractions and potentially falling into adultery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brown|first1=Michael|title=Why the Mike Pence Rule is as Christian as it is Wise|url=https://stream.org/mike-pence-rule-christian-wise/|accessdate=May 4, 2018|agency=The Stream|date=November 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public opinion ==
According to a 2017 poll conducted by the [[Morning Consult]] for the [[New York Times]], 53% of women and 45% of men believe that it would be inappropriate to have dinner alone with someone of the opposite sex who is not their spouse, compared to 35% of women and 43% of men who would consider it appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=It’s Not Just Mike Pence.

{{Criticism of Islam sidebar}}
{{Lead too short|date=September 2016}}
The [[Quran]] is viewed to be the scriptural foundation of Islam and is believed by Muslims to have been revealed, without issue, to [[Muhammad]] by the angel [[Gabriel]]. '''Criticism of the Quran''' has frequently occurred since western scholarship has looked to decipher, understand and verify the claims of Islamic thought as stated in the Quran. Issues relating to the authenticity and morality of the [[Quran]] are criticized.&lt;ref name="BibleInQuran"&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1032&amp;letter=B#3068 Bible in Mohammedian Literature.], by Kaufmann Kohler Duncan B. McDonald, ''Jewish Encyclopedia''. Retrieved April 22, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Both critics and some scholars of western, eastern and secular backgrounds claim to have discovered scientific errors adding allegations of contradictions in the Quran while questioning its interpreted moral and ethical message.

==Historical authenticity==
{{See also|History of the Quran|Historicity of Muhammad}}

According to [[F. E. Peters]], Professor Emeritus of History, Religion and Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies at New York University:

&lt;blockquote&gt;What commends it (Quran) so powerfully to the historian is its authenticity, not as the Word of God, of course, as the Muslims believe but as the secular historian cannot and should not, but rather as a document attesting to what Muhammad said at that time and place, early seventh-century Mecca. It is not a transcript, however; our present Quran is the result of an edition prepared under the orders of Uthman... but the search for significant variants in the partial versions extant before Uthman's standard edition, what can be called the sources behind our text, has not yielded any differences of great significance. Those Uthmanic clues are fragmentary, however, and large 'invented' portions might well have been added to our Quran or authentic material deleted. So it has been charged in fact by some Muslims who failed to find in the present Quran any explicit reference to the designation of a successor to the Prophet and so have alleged tampering with the original texts. But the argument is so patently tendentious and the evidence adduced for the fact so exiguous that few have failed to be convinced that what is in our copy of the Quran is in fact what Muhammad taught, and is expressed in his own words.&lt;ref name="Peters1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Francis E. Peters|title=Muhammad and the Origins of Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0OrCo4VyvGkC&amp;pg=PA257|year=1994|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-1875-8|pages=257–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Traditional view===
According to Islamic tradition, the Quran is the literal [[Divine language|word of God]] as recited to the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] through the angel Gabriel. Muhammad, according to tradition, recited perfectly what the angel Gabriel revealed to him for his companions to write down and memorize. Muslims believe that the wording of the Quranic text available today corresponds exactly to that revealed to Muhammad in the years 610–632.&lt;ref&gt;John Esposito, ''Islam the Straight Path'', Extended Edition, p.19-20&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maurice Bucaille]], medical doctor, author and member of the French Society of Egyptology, states in ''[[The Bible, The Qur'an and Science]]'' that "The Quranic Revelation has a history which is fundamentally different from the other two. It spanned a period of some twenty years and, as soon as it was believed to be transmitted to Muhammad by Archangel Gabriel, Believers learned it by heart."{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} It is traditionally believed to have been written down during Muhammad's life.

===Variations to Christian theology===
Dr. [[Suliman Bashear]], leading scholar and administrator at the University of Nablus discusses the question: which of two sons was meant to be [[Binding of Isaac|sacrificed]] by [[Abraham]]; [[Isaac in Islam|Ishaq]] or [[Ishmael in Islam|Ismail]]:

{{quote|In itself, the impressively long list of mainly late scholars and commentators who favoured Ismail confirms [[Ignác Goldziher|Goldziher]]’s note that this view eventually emerged victorious. In view of the present study, however, one must immediately add that such victory was facilitated only as part of the general process of promoting the position of Mecca as the cultic center of Islam by connecting it with the Biblical heritage on the story of Abraham’s trial or, to use [[John Wansbrough|Wansbrough]]’s terminology, the reproduction of an Arabian–Hijazi version of Judaeo-Christian ‘prophetology.’&lt;ref&gt;Suliman Bashear, ''Abraham's Sacrifice of his Son and Related Issues'', in: Der Islam, Volume 67 (1990), Issue 2, pp. 276—77.&lt;/ref&gt;''}}

===Earliest witness testimony===
The last recensions to make an official and uniform Quran in a single dialect were effected under [[Uthman#Reign as a Caliph .28644.E2.80.93656.29|Caliph Uthman]] (644–656) starting some twelve years after the Prophet's death and finishing twenty-four years after the effort began, with all other existing personal and individual copies and dialects of the Quran being burned:

{{quote | When they had copied the sheets, Uthman sent a copy to each of the main centers of the empire with the command that all other Qur'an materials, whether in single sheet form, or in whole volumes, were to be burned.&lt;ref&gt;(Burton, pp. 141–42 – citing Ahmad b. `Ali b. Muhammad al `Asqalani, ibn Hajar, "Fath al Bari", 13 vols, Cairo, 1939/1348, vol. 9, p. 18).&lt;/ref&gt;''}}

It is traditionally believed the earliest writings had the advantage of being checked by people who already knew the text by heart, for they had learned it at the time of the revelation itself and had subsequently recited it constantly. Since the official compilation was completed several decades after Muhammad's death, the Uthman text has been scrupulously preserved. Bucaille believed that this did not give rise to any problems of this Quran's authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bucaille|first=Dr. Maurice|title=The Bible, the Quran, and Science: The Holy Scriptures Examined in the Light of Modern Knowledge|year=1977|publisher=TTQ, INC.f|isbn=978-1-879402-98-0 |page=268|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sN65wjDOQH0C&amp;pg=PA256&amp;dq=quran+science&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=tFfYTZDlO-nB0AHg97T8Aw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Muir|Muir]]'s ''The Life of Mahomet'' explains the outcome of these oral tradition when researching Al-Bukhari:

{{quote | Reliance upon oral traditions, at a time when they were transmitted by memory alone, and every day produced new divisions among the professors of Islam, opened up a wide field for fabrication and distortion. There was nothing easier, when required to defend any religious or political system, than to appeal to an oral tradition of the Prophet. The nature of these so-called traditions, and the manner in which the name of Mohammad was abused to support all possible lies and absurdities, may be gathered most clearly from the fact that Al-Bukhari who travelled from land to land to gather from the learned the traditions they had received, came to conclusion, after many years sifting, that out of 600,000 traditions, ascertained by him to be then current, only 4000 were authentic!&lt;ref&gt;Muir, ''The Life of Mahomet'', 3rd Edition, Indian Reprint, New Delhi, 1992, pp. 41–42.&lt;/ref&gt;''}}

Regarding who was the first to collect the narrations, and whether or not it was compiled into a single book by the time of Muhammad's death is contradicted by witnesses living when Muhammad lived, several historical narratives appear:

Zaid b. Thabit said:

{{quote | The Prophet died and the Qur’an had not been assembled into a single place.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmad b. Ali b. Muhammad al ’Asqalani, ibn Hajar, Fath al Bari [13 vol., Cairo 1939], vol. 9, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;''}}

It is reported… from Ali who said:

{{quote | May the mercy of Allah be upon Abu Bakr, the foremost of men to be rewarded with the collection of the manuscripts, for he was the first to collect (the text) between (two) covers.&lt;ref&gt;John Gilchrist, Jam' Al-Qur'an.  ''The Codification of the Qur'an Text A Comprehensive Study of the Original Collection of the Qur'an Text and the Early Surviving Qur'an Manuscripts'', [MERCSA, Mondeor, 2110 Republic of South Africa, 1989], Chapter 1. "The Initial Collection of the Qur'an Text", p. 27 – citing Ibn Abi Dawud, Kitab al-Masahif, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;''}}

It is reported… from Ibn Buraidah who said:

{{quote | The first of those to collect the Qur'an into a mushaf (codex) was Salim, the freed slave of Abu Hudhaifah.&lt;ref&gt;(Ibid., citing as-Suyuti, Al-Itqan fii Ulum al-Qur'an, p. 135).&lt;/ref&gt;''}}

===Extant copies prior to Uthman version===
{{See also|Sana'a manuscript|Birmingham Quran manuscript}}

The [[Sana'a manuscript]] contains older portions of the Quran showing variances different from the Uthman copy.  The parchment upon which the lower codex of the Sana'a manuscript is written has been radiocarbon dated with 99% accuracy to before 671 CE, with a 95.5% probability of being older than 661 CE and 75% probability from before 646 CE.{{sfn|Sadeghi|Goudarzi|2012|p=8}} Tests by the Oxford Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit indicated with a probability of more than 94 percent that the parchment dated from 568 to 645, possibly before Muhammad's official birth year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/23/world/europe/quran-fragments-university-birmingham.html?mcubz=0|title=A Find in Britain: Quran Fragments Perhaps as Old as Islam|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sana'a palimpsest is one of the most important manuscripts of the collection in the world.  This palimpsest has two layers of text, both of which are Quranic and written in the [[Hijazi script]]. While the upper text is almost identical with the modern Qurans in use (with the exception of spelling variants), the lower text contains significant diversions from the standard text. For example, in sura 2, verse 87, the lower text has ''wa-qaffaynā 'alā āthārihi'' whereas the standard text has ''wa-qaffaynā min ba'dihi''. The Sana'a manuscript has exactly the same verses and the same order of verses as the standard Qur'an.{{sfn|Sadeghi|Goudarzi|2012|p=26}} The order of the suras in the Sana'a codex is different from the order in the standard Qur'an.{{sfn|Sadeghi|Goudarzi|2012|p=23}} Such variants are similar to the ones reported for the Quran codices of Companions such as [[Ibn Masud]] and [[Ubay ibn Ka'b]]. However, variants occur much more frequently in the Sana'a codex, which contains "by a rough estimate perhaps twenty-five times as many [as Ibn Mas'ud's reported variants]".{{sfn|Sadeghi|Goudarzi|2012|p=20}}

In 2015, the [[University of Birmingham]] disclosed that scientific tests may show a Quran manuscript in its collection as one of the oldest known and believe it was written close to the time of Muhammad. Dr Saud al-Sarhan, Director of [[King Faisal Foundation#King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies|Center for Research and Islamic Studies]] in [[Riyadh]], questions whether the parchment might have been reused as a [[palimpsest]], and also noted that the writing had chapter separators and dotted verse endings – features in [[Arabic script]]s which are believed not to have been introduced to the Qur'an until later.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/23/world/europe/quran-fragments-university-birmingham.html|title=A Find in Britain: Quran Fragments Perhaps as Old as Islam |author=Dan Bilefsky |date=22 July 2015 |newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr Saud's criticisms was affirmed by several Saudi-based experts in Quranic history, who strongly rebut any speculation that the Birmingham/Paris Quran could have been written during the lifetime of the Prophet Muhammad. They emphasize that while Muhammad was alive, Quranic texts were written without chapter decoration, marked verse endings or use of coloured inks; and did not follow any standard sequence of surahs. They maintain that those features were introduced into Quranic practice in the time of the Caliph Uthman, and so the Birmingham leaves could have been written later, but not earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/index.cfm?method=home.regcon&amp;contentid=20150727251595 |title=Experts doubt oldest Quran claim |date=27 July 2015 |newspaper=Saudi Gazette |access-date=27 July 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906130646/http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/index.cfm?method=home.regcon&amp;contentid=20150727251595 |archivedate=6 September 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Süleyman Berk of the faculty of Islamic studies at [[Yalova University]] has noted the strong similarity between the script of the Birmingham leaves and those of a number of Hijazi Qurans in the [[Turkish and Islamic Arts Museum]]; which were brought to Istanbul from the [[Umayyad Mosque|Great Mosque of Damascus]] following a fire in 1893. Professor Berk recalls that these manuscripts had been intensively researched in association with an exhibition on the history of the Quran, ''The Quran in its 1,400th Year''  held in Istanbul in 2010, and the findings published by François Déroche as ''Qur’ans of the Umayyads'' in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Déroche|first=François|title=Qur’ans of the Umayyads: a first overview|year=2013|publisher=Brill Publishers|isbn=|pages=67–69}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that study, the Paris Quran, [[BnF Arabe 328(c)]], is compared with Qurans in Istanbul, and concluded as having been written "around the end of the seventh century and the beginning of the eighth century."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailysabah.com/history/2015/07/27/oldest-quran-still-a-matter-of-controversy|title=Oldest Quran still a matter of controversy|date=27 July 2015 |newspaper=Daily Sabah|access-date=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015 Professor [[:fr:François Déroche|François Déroche]] of the [[Collège de France]] confirmed the identification of the two Birmingham leaves with those of the Paris Qur'an BnF Arabe 328(c), as had been proposed by Dr Alba Fedeli. Prof. Deroche expressed reservations about the reliability of the radiocarbon dates proposed for the Birmingham leaves, noting instances elsewhere in which radiocarbon dating had proved inaccurate in testing Qur'ans with an explicit endowment date; and also that none of the counterpart Paris leaves had yet been carbon-dated. Jamal bin Huwareib, managing director of the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Foundation, has proposed that, were the radiocarbon dates to be confirmed, the Birmingham/Paris Qur'an might be identified with the text known to have been assembled by the first [[Caliph]] [[Abu Bakr]], between 632–634 CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-35151643|title=Birmingham's ancient Koran history revealed|date=23 December 2015 |publisher=BBC|access-date=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Further research and findings===
Critical research of historic events and timeliness of eye witness accounts reveal the effort of later traditionalists to consciously promote, for nationalistic purposes, the centrist concept of Mecca and prophetic descent from Ismail, in order to grant a [[Hejaz|Hijazi]] orientation to the emerging religious identity of Islam:

{{quote|For, our attempt to date the relevant traditional material confirms on the whole the conclusions which [[Joseph Schacht|Schacht]] arrived at from another field, specifically the tendency of [[Hadith_studies#Sanad and matn|isnads]] to grow backwards.&lt;ref&gt;J. Schacht, ''The Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence'', London, 1950, pp. 107, 156.&lt;/ref&gt;''}}

In their book ''[[Hagarism: The Making of the Islamic World]]'', [[Patricia Crone]] and [[Michael Cook (historian)|Michael Cook]] challenge the traditional account of how the Quran was compiled, writing that "there is no hard evidence for the existence of the Koran in any form before the last decade of the seventh century."&lt;ref name="Hagarism"&gt;Patricia Crone, Michael Cook, and Gerd R. Puin as quoted in {{Cite news| url=https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/199901/koran | publisher=The Atlantic Monthly | title=What Is the Koran? | author=Toby Lester |date=January 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crone, Wansbrough, and Nevo argue that all the primary sources which exist are from 150–300 years after the events which they describe, and thus are chronologically far removed from those events.&lt;ref&gt;[[Yehuda D. Nevo]] "Towards a Prehistory of Islam," ''Jerusalem Studies in Arabic and Islam'', vol. 17, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 1994 p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John Wansbrough]] ''The Sectarian Milieu: Content and Composition of Islamic Salvation History'', Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1978 p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Patricia Crone]], ''Meccan Trade and the Rise of Islam,'' Princeton University Press, 1987 p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Uthman Koran Taschkent a.jpg|220px|thumb|left|Quran from the 9th century. It was alleged to be a 7th-century original from [[Uthman]] era]]

It is generally acknowledged that the work of Crone and Cook was a fresh approach in its reconstruction of early [[Muslim history|Islamic history]], but the theory has been almost universally rejected.&lt;ref&gt;David Waines, ''Introduction to Islam'', Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]], 1995. {{ISBN|0-521-42929-3}}, pp. 273–74&lt;/ref&gt; Van Ess has dismissed it stating that "a refutation is perhaps unnecessary since the authors make no effort to prove it in detail ... Where they are only giving a new interpretation of well-known facts, this is not decisive. But where the accepted facts are consciously put upside down, their approach is disastrous."&lt;ref name="van Ess"&gt;van Ess, "The Making Of Islam", ''[[The Times Literary Supplement|Times Literary Supplement]]'', Sep 8 1978, p. 998&lt;/ref&gt; R. B. Serjeant states that "[Crone and Cook's thesis]… is not only bitterly anti-Islamic in tone, but anti-Arabian. Its superficial fancies are so ridiculous that at first one wonders if it is just a 'leg pull', pure 'spoof'."&lt;ref&gt;R. B. Serjeant, ''Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society'' (1978) p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francis Edward Peters]] states that "Few have failed to be convinced that what is in our copy of the Quran is, in fact, what Muhammad taught, and is expressed in his own words".&lt;ref&gt;Peters, F. E. (Aug., 1991) "The Quest of the [[Historical Muhammad]]." ''[[International Journal of Middle East Studies]]'', Vol. 23, No. 3, pp. 291–315.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, legal scholar Liaquat Ali Khan claimed that Crone and Cook later explicitly disavowed their earlier book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/2006/04/28/d60428020635.htm|title=Hagarism: The Story of a Book Written by Infidels for Infidels|accessdate=2006-06-12|author=Liaquat Ali Khan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://baltimorechronicle.com/2006/042606AliKhan.shtml|title=Hagarism: The Story of a Book Written by Infidels for Infidels|accessdate=2006-06-09|author=Liaquat Ali Khan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patricia Crone in an article published in 2006 provided an update on the evolution of her conceptions since the printing of the thesis in 1976. In the article she acknowledges that Muhammad existed as a historical figure and that the Quran represents "utterances" of his that he believed to be revelations. However she states that the Quran may not be the complete record of the revelations. She also accepts that oral histories and Muslim historical accounts cannot be totally discounted, but remains skeptical about the traditional account of the [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijrah]] and the standard view that Muhammad and his tribe were based in Mecca. She describes the difficulty in the handling of the [[hadith]] because of their "amorphous nature" and purpose as documentary evidence for deriving religious law rather than as historical narratives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opendemocracy.net/faith-europe_islam/mohammed_3866.jsp|title=What do we actually know about Mohammed?|date=3 September 2014|website=openDemocracy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The author of the ''[[Apology of al-Kindy]]'' Abd al-Masih ibn Ishaq al-Kindi (not the famed philosopher [[al-Kindi]]) claimed that the narratives in the Quran were "all jumbled together and intermingled" and that this was "an evidence that many different hands have been at work therein, and caused discrepancies, adding or cutting out whatever they liked or disliked".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in A. Rippin, ''Muslims: their religious beliefs and practices: Volume 1'', London, 1991, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; Bell and Watt suggested that the variation in writing style throughout the Quran, which sometimes involves the use of rhyming, may have indicated revisions to the text during its compilation. They claimed that there were "abrupt changes in the length of verses; sudden changes of the dramatic situation, with changes of pronoun from singular to plural, from second to third person, and so on".&lt;ref&gt;R. Bell &amp; W.M. Watt, ''An introduction to the Quran'', Edinburgh, 1977, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, however, they noted that "[i]f any great changes by way of addition, suppression or alteration had been made, controversy would almost certainly have arisen; but of that there is little trace." They also note that "Modern study of the Quran has not in fact raised any serious question of its authenticity. The style varies, but is almost unmistakable."&lt;ref&gt;''Bell's introduction to the Qurʼān''.  By Richard Bell, William Montgomery Watt, p. 51: [https://books.google.com/books?id=4WTr0hIOzd8C&amp;q=authenticity#v=snippet&amp;q=authenticity&amp;f=false Google preview]&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent study has argued that the Quran we have today is exactly the same as the one compiled by 'Ali ibn Abi-Talib, and that the reading of Hafs from his teacher 'Asim to be the unaltered reading of 'Ali. This is because 'Asim's teacher, Abu 'Abd al-Rahman al-Sulami, had learnt the Quran from 'Ali. Furthermore, Hafs was a Companion of Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq and it is claimed that the latter had inherited 'Ali's Master Copy of the Quran. The study provides a case that it was 'Ali's Master Copy which formed the basis of the 'Uthmanic canon. As for the reading of Hafs, the study presents evidence that the latter had learnt the Quran from two sources: 'Asim who was his main teacher, and Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq who provided him with a corrective of 'Asim's reading. If future research can validate these preliminary findings, then this could very well mean that the reading of Hafs from Asim is the ''de facto'' reading of 'Ali which he inherited from the Prophet till the very last dot."&lt;ref&gt;''New Light on the Collection and Authenticity of the Qur'an: The Case for the Existence of a Master Copy and how it Relates to the Reading of Hafs ibn Sulayman from 'Asim ibn Abi al-Nujud'', By Ahmed El-Wakil: [https://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/journal_of_shia_islamic_studies/v008/8.4.el-wakil.html][https://www.academia.edu/23738223/New_Light_on_the_Collection_and_Authenticity_of_the_Quran_The_Case_for_the_Existence_of_a_Master_Copy_and_how_it_Relates_to_the_Reading_of_Hafs_ibn_Sulayman_from_Asim_ibn_Abi_al_Nujud]&lt;/ref&gt;

The  ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'', for example, writes: "The language of the Koran is held by the Mohammedans to be a peerless model of perfection. Critics, however, argue that peculiarities can be found in the text. For example, critics note that a sentence in which something is said concerning Allah is sometimes followed immediately by another in which Allah is the speaker (examples of this are suras xvi. 81, xxvii. 61, xxxi. 9, and xliii. 10.) Many peculiarities in the positions of words are due to the necessities of rhyme (lxix. 31, lxxiv. 3), while the use of many rare words and new forms may be traced to the same cause (comp. especially xix. 8, 9, 11, 16)."&lt;ref name="JE"&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=363&amp;letter=K&amp;search=Koran "Koran"].

But if you look at it, you will notice that every fifth sentence or so simply doesn’t make sense... the fact is that a fifth of the Koranic text is just incomprehensible..."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ibn Ishaq]], an Arab Muslim historian and hagiographer who collected oral traditions that formed the basis of the important biography of Muhammad, also claimed that as a result of these discussions, the Qur'an was ''revealed'' addressing all these arguments – leading to the conclusion that Muhammad may have incorporated Judeo-Christian tales he had heard from other people. For example, in al-Sirah an-Nabawiyyah (an edited version of Ibn Ishaq's original work), [[Ibn Hishām]]'s report

{{quote|''explains that the Prophet used often to sit at the hill of Marwa inviting a Christian...but they actually also would have had some resources with which to teach the Prophet.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Osman |first=Ghada |last2= |first2= |date=2005 |title=Foreign slaves in Mecca and Medina in the formative Islamic period |url= |journal=Islam and Christian–Muslim Relations |publisher=Routledge |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=345–59 |doi=10.1080/09596410500250230 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mohammed or God as speakers===
According to [[Ibn Warraq]], the Iranian rationalist [[Ali Dashti]] criticized the Quran on the basis that for some passages, "the speaker cannot have been God."&lt;ref name="Warraq - Why I am Not"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Warraq|title=Why I am Not a Muslim|publisher=Prometheus Books|isbn=0-87975-984-4|pages=106|url=http://www.conflicts.rem33.com/images/books/Ibn%20Warraq%20-%20Why%20I%20Am%20Not%20a%20Muslim.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warraq gives [[Al-Fatiha|Surah Fatihah]] as an example of a passage which is "clearly addressed to God, in the form of a prayer."&lt;ref name="Warraq - Why I am Not"/&gt; He says that by only adding the word "say" in front of the passage, this difficulty could have been removed. Furthermore, it is also known that one of the companions of Muhammad, [[Ibn Masud]], rejected Surah Fatihah as being part of the Quran; these kind of disagreements are, in fact, common among the companions of Muhammad who could not decide which surahs were part of the Quran and which not.&lt;ref name="Warraq - Why I am Not"/&gt; Quran is divided into two parts the seven verses ([[Al-Fatiha]]) and Quran the great.

Cases where the speaker is swearing an oath by God, such as surahs 75:1–2 and 90:1, have been made a point of criticism.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} But according to [[Richard Bell (Arabist)|Richard Bell]], this was probably a traditional formula, and [[Montgomery Watt]] compared such verses to {{Bibleverse|Hebrews|6:13|KJV}}. It is also widely acknowledged that the first-person plural pronoun in Surah 19:64 refers to angels, describing their being sent by God down to Earth. Bell and Watt suggest that this attribution to angels can be extended to interpret certain verses where the speaker is not clear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Edinburgh University Press| isbn = 978-0-7486-0597-2| last1 = Bell| first1 = Richard| last2 = Watt| first2 = William Montgomery| title = Bell's introduction to the Qurʼān| date = 1970|pages=66–67}}, and note.10&lt;/ref&gt;

===Science in the Quran===
{{See also|Qur'an and science|Islamic views on evolution}}

Many modern Muslims believe that the Quran does make scientific statements{{dubious|date=August 2016}}; however, many classical Muslim commentators and scientists, notably [[al-Biruni]], assigned to the Quran a separate and autonomous realm of its own and held that the Quran "does not interfere in the business of science nor does it infringe on the realm of science."&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia of the Qurʾān"/&gt; These medieval scholars argued for the possibility of multiple [[Models of scientific inquiry|scientific explanations]] of the natural phenomena, and refused to subordinate the Quran to an ever-changing science.&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia of the Qurʾān"/&gt; Some modern scholars like [[Ideas of Ghulam Ahmed Pervez|G.

===Abrogation===
[[Naskh (tafsir)|Naskh]] (نسخ) is an Arabic language word usually translated as "abrogation"; it shares the same root as the words appearing in the phrase ''al-nāsikh wal-mansūkh'' (الناسخ والمنسوخ, "the abrogater and the abrogated [verses]").  The concept of "abrogation" in the Quran is that God chose to reveal ayat (singular ayah; means a sign or miracle, commonly a verse in the Quran) that supersede earlier ayat in the same Quran.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} The abrogation means that the revelation about the stories of previous messengers cannot be used as legal basis because they are abrogated by more general verses of Quran. The central ayah that deals with abrogation is Surah 2:106:

:"We do not abrogate a verse or cause it to be forgotten except that We bring forth [one] better than it or similar to it. Do you not know that Allah is over all things competent?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quran.com/2/106 |title=Surat Al-Baqarah 2:106&amp;#93; – The Noble Qur'an – القرآن الكريم |publisher=Quran.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philip Schaff]] argues that the concept of abrogation was developed to "remove" contradictions found in the Quran:

:"It abounds in repetitions and contradictions, which are not removed by the convenient theory of abrogation."&lt;ref name="Schaff 1910 4.III.44"&gt;Schaff, P., &amp; Schaff, D. S. (1910). History of the Christian church.  Third edition. New York: Charles Scribner’s Sons. Volume 4,  Chapter III, section 44 "The Koran, And The Bible"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Muhammad Husayn Tabatabaei]] believes abrogation in Quranic verses is not an indication of contradiction but an indication of addition and supplementation. As an example he mentions 2:109&lt;ref name="Quran.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quran.com/2/109 |title=Surat Al-Baqarah 2:109&amp;#93; – The Noble Qur'an – القرآن الكريم |publisher=Quran.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; where -according to him- it clearly states the forgiveness is not permanent and soon there will be another command (through another verse) on this subject that completes the matter. He also mentions 4:15&lt;ref name="Quran.com"/&gt; where the abrogated verse indicates its temporariness.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Mizan, Muhammad Husayn Tabatabayei, commentation on 2:106 translation available here {{cite web|url=http://www.shiasource.com/al-mizan/self/tafsir-2-106-107/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306193941/http://www.shiasource.com/al-mizan/self/tafsir-2-106-107/ |archivedate=2012-03-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scholars; however, have translated the 'abrogation' verse differently and disagree with the mainstream view. [[Ghulam Ahmed Parwez]] in his ''Exposition of the Quran'' derived the following meaning from the verse 2:106, making it consistent with the overall content of the Quran:

: ''The Ahl-ul-Kitab (People of the Book) also question the need for a new revelation (Qur'an) when previous revelations from Allah exist. They further ask why the Qur'an contains injunctions contrary to the earlier Revelation (the Torah) if it is from Allah? Tell them that Our way of sending Revelation to successive anbiya (prophets) is that: Injunctions given in earlier revelations, which were meant only for a particular time, are replaced by other injunctions, and injunctions which were to remain in force permanently but were abandoned, forgotten or adulterated by the followers of previous anbiya are given again in their original form (22:52). And all this happens in accordance with Our laid down standards, over which We have complete control. Now this last code of life which contains the truth of all previous revelations (5:48), is complete in every respect (6:116), and will always be preserved (15:9), has been given [to mankind].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tolueislam.org/exposition-of-the-holy-quran-02-surah-al-baqarah-g-a-parwez/ |title=Exposition of the Holy Quran – Ghulam Ahmad Parwez – Tolue Islam Trust |publisher=tolueislam.org |date= |accessdate=2015-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Satanic verses===
{{Main|Satanic Verses}}

Some criticism of the Quran has revolved around two verses known as the "[[Satanic Verses]]". Some early Islamic [[Satanic Verses#Complete Account (Tabarī)|histories recount]] that as Muhammad was reciting Sūra Al-Najm (Q.53), as revealed to him by the angel Gabriel, [[Satan]] tempted him to utter the following lines after verses 19 and 20: "Have you thought of [[Al-lāt]] and [[al-'Uzzā]] and [[Manāt]] the third, the other; These are the exalted [[Gharaniq]], whose intercession is hoped for." The Allāt, al-'Uzzā and Manāt were three goddesses worshiped by the Meccans. These histories then say that these 'Satanic Verses' were repudiated shortly afterward by Muhammad at the behest of Gabriel.&lt;ref&gt;"The Life of Muhammad", [[Ibn Ishaq]], [[Alfred Guillaume|A. Guillaume]] (translator), 2002, p. 166 {{ISBN|0-19-636033-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are numerous accounts reporting the alleged incident, which differ in the construction and detail of the narrative, but they may be broadly collated to produce a basic account.&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia of the Qurʾān"&gt;{{Citation

As he was reciting [[an-Najm|Sūra an-Najm]],&lt;ref&gt;([[wikisource:The Holy Qur'an/An-Najm|Q.53]])&lt;/ref&gt; considered a revelation by the angel [[Gabriel]], [[Shaitan|Satan]] tempted him to utter the following lines after [[Ayat|verses]] 19 and 20:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Have ye thought upon [[Al-lāt|Al-Lat]] and [[Al-‘Uzzá]]
&lt;br /&gt;and [[Manāt]], the third, the other?&lt;br /&gt;These are the exalted ''[[Gharaniq|gharāniq]]'', whose intercession is hoped for.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Allāt, al-'Uzzā and Manāt were three goddesses worshipped by the Meccans. Discerning the meaning of "''gharāniq''" is difficult, as it is a ''[[hapax legomenon]]'' (i.e. only used once in the text). Commentators wrote that it meant the [[Crane (bird)|cranes]]. The Arabic word does generally mean a "crane" – appearing in the singular as ''ghirnīq, ghurnūq, ghirnawq'' and ''ghurnayq'', and the word has cousin forms in other words for birds, including "raven, crow" and "eagle".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The subtext to the event is that Muhammad was backing away from his otherwise uncompromising [[monotheism]] by saying that these goddesses were real and their intercession effective. The Meccans were overjoyed to hear this and joined Muhammad in ritual prostration at the end of the ''sūrah''. The Meccan refugees who had fled to Abyssinia heard of the end of persecution and started to return home. Islamic tradition holds that Gabriel chastised Muhammad for adulterating the revelation, at which point {{Quran-usc|22|52}} is revealed to comfort him,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Never sent We a messenger or a prophet before thee but when He recited (the message) Satan proposed (opposition) in respect of that which he recited thereof. But Allah abolisheth that which Satan proposeth. Then Allah establisheth His revelations. Allah is Knower, Wise.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Muhammad took back his words and the [[fitna (word)|persecution]] of the Meccans resumed. Verses {{Quran-usc-range|53|21|23}} were given, in which the goddesses are belittled. The passage in question, from 53:19, reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Have ye thought upon Al-Lat and Al-'Uzza
&lt;br /&gt;And Manat, the third, the other?
&lt;br /&gt;Are yours the males and His the females?
&lt;br /&gt;That indeed were an unfair division!
&lt;br /&gt;They are but names which ye have named, ye and your fathers, for which Allah hath revealed no warrant. They follow but a guess and that which (they) themselves desire. And now the guidance from their Lord hath come unto them.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The incident of the Satanic Verses is put forward by some critics as evidence of the Quran's origins as a human work of Muhammad. [[Maxime Rodinson]] describes this as a conscious attempt to achieve a consensus with pagan Arabs, which was then consciously rejected as incompatible with Muhammad's attempts to answer the criticism of contemporary Arab Jews and Christians,&lt;ref&gt;Maxime Rodinson, ''Muhammad'' (Tauris Parke, London, 2002) ({{ISBN|1-86064-827-4}}) pp. 107–08.&lt;/ref&gt; linking it with the moment at which Muhammad felt able to adopt a "hostile attitude" towards the pagan Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;Maxime Rodinson, ''Muhammad'' (Tauris Parke, London, 2002) ({{ISBN|1-86064-827-4}}) p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Rodinson writes that the story of the Satanic Verses is unlikely to be false because it was "one incident, in fact, which may be reasonably accepted as true because the makers of Muslim tradition would not have invented a story with such damaging implications for the revelation as a whole".&lt;ref&gt;Maxime Rodinson, ''Muhammad'' (Tauris Parke, London, 2002) ({{ISBN|1-86064-827-4}}) p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; In a caveat to his acceptance of the incident, William Montgomery Watt, states: "Thus it was not for any worldly motive that Muhammad eventually turned down the offer of the Meccans, but for a genuinely religious reason; not for example, because he could not trust these men nor because any personal ambition would remain unsatisfied, but because acknowledgment of the goddesses would lead to the failure of the cause, of the mission he had been given by God."&lt;ref&gt;W. Montgomery Watt, ''Muhammad at Mecca'', Oxford, 1953. 'The Growth of Opposition', p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; Academic scholars such as [[William Montgomery Watt]] and [[Alfred Guillaume]] argued for its authenticity based upon the implausibility of Muslims fabricating a story so unflattering to their prophet. Watt says that "the story is so strange that it must be true in essentials."&lt;ref name="Watt"&gt;{{Cite book| last=Watt | first=W. Montgomery  | title=Muhammad: Prophet and Statesman| year=1961 | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=0-19-881078-4 | page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, John Burton rejected the tradition.

In an inverted culmination of Watt's approach, Burton argued the narrative of the "satanic verses" was forged, based upon a demonstration of its actual utility to certain elements of the Muslim community – namely, those elite sections of society seeking an "[[asbab al-nuzul#Narratological|occasion of revelation]]" for [[naskh (exegesis)#Modes|eradicatory modes]] of [[naskh (exegesis)|abrogation]].&lt;ref&gt;John Burton (1970). "Those Are the High-Flying Cranes". ''Journal of Semitic Studies'' 15: 246–264.&lt;/ref&gt; Burton's argument is that such stories served the vested interests of the status-quo, allowing them to dilute the radical messages of the Quran. The rulers used such narratives to build their own set of laws which contradicted the Quran, and justified it by arguing that not all of the Quran is binding on Muslims. Burton also sides with [[Leone Caetani]], who wrote that the story of the "satanic verses" should be rejected not only on the basis of ''isnad'', but because ''"had these hadiths even a degree of historical basis, Muhammad's reported conduct on this occasion would have given the lie to the whole of his previous prophetic activity."''&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by I.R Netton in "Text and Trauma: An East-West Primer" (1996) p. 86, Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; Eerik Dickinson also pointed out that the Quran's challenge to its opponents to prove any inconsistency in its content was pronounced in a hostile environment, also indicating that such an incident did not occur or it would have greatly damaged the Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;Eerik Dickinson, ''Difficult Passages'', Encyclopaedia of the Qurʾān&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scholars argue that variances in the Quran's explicit intended audiences are irrelevant to claims of divine origin – and for example that Muhammad's wives "specific divine guidance, occasioned by their proximity to the Prophet (Muhammad)" where "Numerous divine reprimands addressed to Muhammad's wives in the Quran establish their special responsibility to overcome their human frailties and ensure their individual worthiness",&lt;ref&gt;''Women in the Quran, traditions, and interpretation'' by Barbara Freyer, p. 85, Mothers of the Believers in the Quran&lt;/ref&gt;  or argue that the Quran must be interpreted on more than one level.&lt;ref&gt;Corbin (1993), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; (See:&lt;ref&gt;[[Quran#Levels of meaning]]&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Jurisprudence==
British-German professor of Arabic and Islam [[Joseph Schacht]], in his work ''[[The Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence]]'' (1950) regarding the subject of law derived from the Quran, wrote:

{{quote|''“Muhammadan [Islamic] law did not derive directly from the Koran but developed ...out of popular and administrative practice under the Umaiyads, and this practice often diverged from the intentions and even the explicit wording of the Koran .... Norms derived from the Koran were introduced into Muhammadan law almost invariably at a secondary stage.”&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Schacht, ''The Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence'', Oxford, 1950, p. 224&lt;/ref&gt;''}}

Schacht further states that every legal tradition from the Prophet must be taken as inauthentic and fictitious expression of a legal doctrine formulated at a later date:

{{quote|''“... We shall not meet any legal tradition from the Prophet which can positively be considered authentic.”&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Schacht, ''The Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence'', Oxford, 1950, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;''}}

What is evident regarding the compilation of the Quran is the disagreement between the [[Sahabah|companions of Muhammad]] (earliest supporters of Muhammad), as evidenced with their several disagreements regarding interpretation and particular versions of the Quran and their interpretative Hadith and Sunna, namely the [[Hadith terminology|mutawatir mushaf]] having come into present form after Muhammad's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Burton |first=John |author-link=John Burton (scholar) |date=1979 |title=The Collection of the Quran |url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Ggc4AAAAIAAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=ibn+ishaq+collection+of+quran&amp;ots=J8JlH8-TwV&amp;sig=XfA8N0oSzOaMH25FWLpLokcKVKY#v=snippet&amp;q=qur'an%20compilation&amp;f=false |location=United Kingdom |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=41 |isbn=0521214394}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Burton (scholar)|John Burton]]'s work ''The Collection of the Quran'' further explores how certain Quranic texts were altered to adjust interpretation, in regards to controversy between [[fiqh]] (human understanding of Sharia) and [[Madhhab|madhahib]].&lt;ref&gt;Burton 1979, pp. 29–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quality==
[[Thomas Carlyle]], after reading [[George Sale|Sale]]'s translation, called the Quran "toilsome reading and a wearisome confused jumble, crude, incondite" with "endless iterations, long-windedness, entanglement" and "insupportable stupidity." He said it is the work of a "great rude human soul".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Carlyle (1841), ''On Heroes, Hero-Worship and the Heroic in History'', p. 64-67&lt;/ref&gt; Gerd Rüdiger Puin noted that approximately every fifth sentence of it does not make any sense despite the Qur'an's own claim of being a clear book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Morality==
{{See also|Islamic ethics}}

According to some critics, the morality of the Quran, like the life story of Muhammad, appears to be a moral regression, by the standards of the moral traditions of Judaism and Christianity it says that it builds upon. The ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', for example, states that "the ethics of Islam are far inferior to those of [[Judaism]] and even more inferior to those of the New Testament" and "that in the ethics of Islam there is a great deal to admire and to approve, is beyond dispute; but of originality or superiority, there is none."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10424a.htm "Mohammed and Mohammedanism"]. From the ''Catholic Encyclopedia''. Retrieved January 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; William Montgomery Watt however finds Muhammad's changes an improvement for his time and place: "In his day and generation Muhammad was a social reformer, indeed a reformer even in the sphere of morals. He created a new system of [[social security]] and a new family structure, both of which were a vast improvement on what went before. By taking what was best in the morality of the nomad and adapting it for settled communities, he established a religious and social framework for the life of many races of men."&lt;ref&gt;W Montgomery Watt, Muhammad: Prophet and Statesman, chapter "Assessment" section "The Alleged Moral Failures", Op. Cit, p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexis de Tocqueville]] (1805 – 1859), a French political thinker and historian, observed:

{{Quote|I studied the Quran a great deal. I came away from that study with the conviction that by and large there have been few religions in the world as deadly to men as that of Muhammad. As far as I can see, it is the principal cause of the decadence so visible today in the Muslim world and, though less absurd than the polytheism of old, its social and political tendencies are in my opinion more to be feared, and I therefore regard it as a form of decadence rather than a form of progress in relation to paganism.&lt;ref&gt;Alexis de Tocqueville; Olivier Zunz, Alan S. Kahan (2002). [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JhEVK0UMgFMC&amp;redir_esc=y ] {{cite book | title=The Tocqueville Reader }} Blackwell Publishing. ISBN 063121545X.

===War and peace===
{{Main|Quran and violence}}

The Quran's teachings on matters of war and peace have become topics of heated discussion in recent years. On the one hand, some critics, such as [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]], interpret that certain verses of the Quran sanction military action against unbelievers as a whole both during the lifetime of Muhammad and after. Harris argues that Muslim extremism is simply a consequence of taking the Quran literally, and is skeptical that "moderate Islam" is possible.&lt;ref name=Harris1&gt;{{Cite book| last=Harris | first=Sam | title=The End of Faith: Religion, Terror, and the Future of Reason | pages=31, 149 | publisher=W. W. Norton; Reprint edition|year=2005| isbn=0-393-32765-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Sam Harris (author)|Harris]] makes a similar argument about [[hadith]], saying "[a]ccording to a literalist reading of the hadith (the literature that recounts the sayings and the actions of the Prophet) if a Muslim decides that he no longer wants to be a Muslim, he should be put to death. If anyone ventures the opinion that the Koran is a mediocre book of religious fiction or that Muhammad was a schizophrenic, he should also be killed. It should go without saying that a desire to kill people for imaginary crimes like apostasy and blasphemy is not an expression of religious moderation." [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sam-harris/who-are-the-moderate-musl_b_15841.html "Who Are the Moderate Muslims?,"] ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', February 16, 2006 (accessed 11/16/2013)&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, other scholars argue that such verses of the Quran are interpreted out of context,&lt;ref name="Boundries_Princeton"&gt;Sohail H. Hashmi, David Miller, ''Boundaries and Justice: diverse ethical perspectives'', Princeton University Press, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Khaleel Muhammad, professor of religious studies at San Diego State University, states, regarding his discussion with the critic Robert Spencer, that "when I am told ... that Jihad only means war, or that I have to accept interpretations of the Quran that non-Muslims (with no good intentions or knowledge of Islam) seek to force upon me, I see a certain agendum developing: one that is based on hate, and I refuse to be part of such an intellectual crime." {{cite web |url=http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/~khaleel/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708102707/http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/~khaleel/ |archivedate=2008-07-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Muslims of the [[Ahmadiyya]] movement argue that when the verses are read in context it clearly appears that the Quran prohibits aggression,&lt;ref&gt;Ali, Maulana Muhammad; The Religion of Islam (6th Edition), Ch V "Jihad" p. 414 "When shall war cease".

The author Syed Kamran Mirza has argued that a concept of '[[Jihad]]', defined as 'struggle', has been introduced by the Quran. He wrote that while Muhammad was in Mecca, he "did not have many supporters and was very weak compared to the Pagans", and "it was at this time he added some 'soft', peaceful verses", whereas "almost all the hateful, coercive and intimidating verses later in the Quran were made with respect to Jihad" when Muhammad was in Medina .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Syed Kamran Mirza|title=An Exegesis on 'Jihad in Islam'|volume=Beyond Jihad: Critical Voices from Inside Islam |publisher=[[Academica Press]], LLC |location= |editor=Kim Ezra Shienbaum |editor2=Jamal Hasan|year=2006 |pages=78–80 |isbn=1-933146-19-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Micheline R. Ishay]] has argued that "the Quran justifies wars for self-defense to protect Islamic communities against internal or external aggression by non-Islamic populations, and wars waged against those who 'violate their oaths' by breaking a treaty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ishay, Micheline |title=The history of human rights |publisher=University of California |location=Berkeley |year= |page=45 |isbn=0-520-25641-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mufti]] [[Mukarram Ahmad|M. Mukarram Ahmed]] has also argued that the Quran encourages people to fight in self-defense. He has also argued that the Quran has been used to direct Muslims to make all possible preparations to defend themselves against enemies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mufti M.

[[Shin Chiba]] and [[Thomas J.

[[Rodrigue Tremblay]] has argued that the Quran commands that non-Muslims under a Muslim regime, should "feel themselves subdued" in "a political state of subservience" . He also argues that the Quran may assert freedom within religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Tremblay, Rodrigue |title=The Code for Global Ethics: Toward a Humanist Civilization |publisher=Trafford Publishing |location= |year=2009 |pages=169–70 |isbn=1-4269-1358-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nisrine Abiad has argued that the Quran incorporates the offence (and due punishment) of "rebellion" into the offence of "highway or armed robbery".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Nisrine Abiad |title=Sharia, Muslim States and International Human Rights Treaty Obligations: A Comparative Study |publisher=British Institute for International &amp; Compara |location= |year=2008 |page=24 |isbn=1-905221-41-X |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George W.

[[Michael David Bonner]] has argued that the "deal between God and those who fight is portrayed as a commercial transaction, either as a loan with interest, or else as a profitable sale of the life of this world in return for the life of the next", where "how much one gains depends on what happens during the transaction", either "paradise if slain in battle, or victory if one survives".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bonner, Michael David |title=Jihad in Islamic history: doctrines and practice |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, N.J |year=2006 |page=32 |isbn=0-691-12574-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have argued that the Quran  "glorified Jihad in many of the Medinese suras" and "criticized those who fail(ed) to participate in it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Peters, Rudolph Albert |title=Jihad in classical and modern Islam: a reader |publisher=Markus Wiener Publishers |location=Princeton |year=2008 |page=46 |isbn=1-55876-359-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ali Ünal]] has claimed that the Quran praises the companions of Muhammad, for being stern and implacable against the said unbelievers, where in that "period of ignorance and savagery, triumphing over these people was possible by being strong and unyielding."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ali Unal |title=The Quran with Annotated Interpretation in Modern English |publisher=The Light, Inc. |location=Rutherford, N.J |year=2008 |page=249 |isbn=1-59784-144-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solomon Nigosian concludes that the "Quranic statement is clear" on the issue of fighting in defense of Islam as "a duty that is to be carried out at all costs", where "God grants security to those Muslims who fight in order to halt or repel aggression".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Nigosian, S.

[[Shaikh M. Ghazanfar]] argues that the Quran has been used to teach its followers that "the path to human salvation does not require withdrawal from the world but rather encourages moderation in worldly affairs", including fighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ghazanfar, Shaikh M. |title=Medieval Islamic economic thought: filling the "great gap" in European economics |publisher=RoutledgeCurzon |location=London |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=0-415-29778-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shabbir Akhtar]] has argued that the Quran asserts that if a people "fear Muhammad more than they fear God, 'they are a people lacking in sense'" rather than a fear being imposed upon them by God directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Akhtar, Shabbir |title=The Quran and the secular mind: a philosophy of Islam |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=2008 |pages= |isbn=0-415-43783-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Violence against women===
{{Main|Islam and Domestic violence|An-Nisa, 34}}

Verse 4:34 of the Quran as translated by Ali Quli Qara'i reads:

:Men are the managers of women, because of the advantage Allah has granted some of them over others, and by virtue of their spending out of their wealth. So righteous women are obedient, care-taking in the absence [of their husbands] of what Allah has enjoined [them] to guard. As for those [wives] whose misconduct you fear, [first] advise them, and [if ineffective] keep away from them in the bed, and [as the last resort] beat them. Then if they obey you, do not seek any course [of action] against them. Indeed, Allah is all-exalted, all-great.&lt;ref name="4-34"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://al-quran.info/#4:34 |title=Surat An-Nisa' 4:34&amp;#93; – The Noble Qur'an – القرآن الكريم |publisher=al-quran.info/#4:34 |date= |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many translations do not necessarily imply a chronological sequence, for example, [[Marmaduke Pickthall]]'s, [[Muhammad Muhsin Khan]]'s, or [[Arthur John Arberry]]'s.  Arberry's translation reads "admonish; banish them to their couches, and beat them."&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard Lewis]] ''A Middle East Mosaic: Fragments of Life, Letters and History'' ([[Modern Library]], 2001) p. 184 {{ISBN|0375758372}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dutch film ''[[Submission (2004 film)|Submission]]'', which rose to fame outside the Netherlands after the assassination of its director [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]] by Muslim extremist [[Mohammed Bouyeri]], critiqued this and similar verses of the Quran by displaying them painted on the bodies of abused Muslim women.&lt;ref name=submission_script&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.opzij.nl/opzij/show?id=23669&amp;framenoid=19755 |title=Script for the movie, Submission |access-date=2012-10-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927225432/http://www.opzij.nl/opzij/show?id=23669&amp;framenoid=19755 |archive-date=2007-09-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Ayaan Hirsi Ali]], the film's writer, said "it is written in the Koran a woman may be slapped if she is disobedient.

Scholars of Islam have a variety of responses to these criticisms. (See [[An-Nisa, 34]] for a fuller exegesis on the meaning of the text.) Some Muslim scholars say that the "beating" allowed is limited to no more than a light touch by siwak, or toothbrush.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onislam.net/english/ask-the-scholar/family/marital-relationships/174868.html |title=Wife Beating in Islamic Perspective - Marital relationships - counsels |publisher=OnIslam.net |date=2013-03-14 |accessdate=2013-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamicfinder.org/articles/article.php?id=307 |title=Articles and FAQs about Islam, Muslims, Allah, Muhammad, Quran, Hadith, Woman, Fiqh and Fatwa |publisher=Islamicfinder.org |date= |accessdate=2013-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Muslims argue that beating is only appropriate if a woman has done "an unrighteous, wicked and rebellious act" beyond mere disobedience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.submission.org/women/beating.html Quranic Perspective on Wife beating and Abuse] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230062211/http://www.submission.org/women/beating.html |date=December 30, 2006 }}, by Fatimah Khaldoon, ''Submission'', 2003.

(1) Perhaps verbal advice or admonition may be sufficient; (2) if not, sex relations may be suspended; (3) if this is not sufficient, some slight physical correction may be administered; but Imam Shafi'i considers this inadvisable, though permissible, and all authorities are unanimous in deprecating any sort of cruelty, even of the nagging kind, as mentioned in the next clause; (4) if all this fails, a family council is recommended in 4:35 below." [[Abdullah Yusuf Ali]], ''The Holy Quran: Text, Translation and Commentary'' (commentary on 4:34), Amana Corporation, Brentwood, MD, 1989. {{ISBN|0-915957-03-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Yusuf al-Qaradawi]], head of the [[European Council for Fatwa and Research]], says that "If the husband senses that feelings of disobedience and rebelliousness are rising against him in his wife, he should try his best to rectify her attitude by kind words, gentle persuasion, and reasoning with her. If this is not helpful, he should sleep apart from her, trying to awaken her agreeable feminine nature so that serenity may be restored, and she may respond to him in a harmonious fashion. If this approach fails, it is permissible for him to beat her lightly with his hands, avoiding her face and other sensitive parts.{{cite web |url=http://www.islamonline.net/fatwa/english/FatwaDisplay.asp?hFatwaID%3D7061 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-06-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050404235348/http://www.islamonline.net/fatwa/english/FatwaDisplay.asp?hFatwaID=7061 |archivedate=2005-04-04 |df= }}.{{cite web |url=http://memri.de/uebersetzungen_analysen/themen/liberal_voices/ges_beating_22_03_04.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-06-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050404235348/http://www.islamonline.net/fatwa/english/FatwaDisplay.asp?hFatwaID=7061 |archivedate=2005-04-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Kathir]] writes that in case of rebellious behavior, the husband is asked to urge his wife to mend her ways, then to refuse to share their beds, and as the last resort, husbands are allowed to admonish their wives by beating.

In no case should he resort to using a stick or any other instrument that might cause pain and injury."{{cite web |url=http://www.islamonline.net/fatwa/english/FatwaDisplay.asp?hFatwaID%3D7061 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-06-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050404235348/http://www.islamonline.net/fatwa/english/FatwaDisplay.asp?hFatwaID=7061 |archivedate=2005-04-04 |df= }}{{cite web |url=http://memri.de/uebersetzungen_analysen/themen/liberal_voices/ges_beating_22_03_04.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-06-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050404235348/http://www.islamonline.net/fatwa/english/FatwaDisplay.asp?hFatwaID=7061 |archivedate=2005-04-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Kathir Ad-Damishqee records in his Tafsir Al-Quran Al-Azim that "Ibn `Abbas and several others said that the Ayah refers to a beating that is not violent. Al-Hasan Al-Basri said that it means, a beating that is not severe."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="shaf"&gt;[[Ahmad Shafaat]], ''[http://www.islamicperspectives.com/Quran-4-34.htm Tafseer of Surah an-Nisa, Ayah 34] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020327203120/http://www.islamicperspectives.com/Quran-4-34.htm |date=2002-03-27 }}'', Islamic Perspectives. August 10, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; or even that they should be "more or less symbolic."&lt;ref&gt;One such authority is the earliest [[Hafiz (Quran)|hafiz]], [[Ibn Abbas]].[http://www.themodernreligion.com/women/w_abuse_badawi.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Abdullah Yusuf Ali]] and [[Ibn Kathir]], the consensus of Islamic scholars is that the above verse describes a light beating.&lt;ref&gt;"The Holy Quran: Text, Translation and Commentary", Abdullah Yusuf Ali, Amana Corporation, Brentwood, MD, 1989. {{ISBN|0-915957-03-5}}, passage was quoted from commentary on 4:34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kathir, Ibn, "Tafsir of Ibn Kathir", Al-Firdous Ltd., London, 2000, 50–53&lt;/ref&gt;

Some jurists argue that even when beating is acceptable under the Quran, it is still discountenanced.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi]] comments that "Whenever the Prophet (peace be on him) permitted a man to administer corporal punishment to his wife, he did so with reluctance, and continued to express his distaste for it. And even in cases where it is necessary, the Prophet (peace be on him) directed men not to hit across the face, nor to beat severely nor to use anything that might leave marks on the body." "Towards Understanding the Quran" Translation by Zafar I. Ansari from "Tafheem Al-Quran" (specifically, commentary on 4:34) by Syed Abul-A'ala Mawdudi, Islamic Foundation, Leicester, England.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The medieval jurist ash-[[Shafi'i]], founder of one of the main schools of ''[[fiqh]]'', commented on this verse that "hitting is permitted, but not hitting is preferable."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[S]ome of the greatest Muslim scholars (e.g., Ash-Shafi'i) are of the opinion that it is just barely permissible, and should preferably be avoided: and they justify this opinion by the Prophet's personal feelings with regard to this problem." [[Muhammad Asad]], ''The Message of the Quran'' (his translation of the Quran).&lt;/ref&gt;

Shabbir Akhtar has argued that the Quran introduced prohibitions against "the pre-Islamic practice of female infanticide" ([https://web.archive.org/web/20121026012552/http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/016-qmt.php#016.058 16:58], [https://web.archive.org/web/20160523003706/http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/017-qmt.php#017.031 17:31],  [https://web.archive.org/web/20160304094957/http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/081-qmt.php#081.008 81:8]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Akhtar, Shabbir |title=The Quran and the secular mind: a philosophy of Islam |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=2008 |page=351 |isbn=0-415-43782-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Houris===
{{Main|Houri}}

Max I. Dimont interprets that the Houris described in the Quran are specifically dedicated to "male pleasure".&lt;ref&gt;The Indestructible Jews, by Max I. Dimont, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;  Henry Martyn claims that the concept of the Houris was chosen to satisfy Mohammed's followers.&lt;ref&gt;Controversial Tracts on Christianity and Mohammedanism, by Henry Martyn, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, [[Annemarie Schimmel]] says that the Quranic description of the Houris should be viewed in a context of love; "every pious man who lives according to God's order will enter Paradise where rivers of milk and honey flow in cool, fragrant gardens and virgin beloveds await home..."&lt;ref&gt;Islam: An Introduction, by Annemarie Schimmel, p. 13, "Muhammad"&lt;/ref&gt;

Under ''[[the Syro-Aramaic Reading of the Quran]]'' by [[Christoph Luxenberg]], the words translating to "Houris" or "Virgins of Paradise" are instead interpreted as "Fruits (grapes)" and "high climbing (wine) bowers... made into first fruits."&lt;ref name="Luxenberg"&gt;Christoph Luxenberg, ''The Syro-Aramaic Reading of the Koran: A Contribution to the Decoding of the Language of the Koran'', Verlag Hans Schiler, 2007, {{ISBN|9783899300888}}, 349 pages, pp. 247–82 – The Huris or Virgins of Paradise&lt;/ref&gt;  Luxemberg offers alternate interpretations of these Quranic verses, including the idea that the Houris should be seen as having a specifically spiritual nature rather than a human nature; "these are all very sensual ideas; but there are also others of a different kind... what can be the object of cohabitation in Paradise as there can be no question of its purpose in the world, the preservation of the race. The solution of this difficulty is found by saying that, although heavenly food, women etc.., have the name in common with their earthly equivalents, it is only by way of metaphorical indication and comparison without actual identity... authors have spiritualized the Houris."&lt;ref name="Luxenberg"/&gt;

==Christians and Jews in the Quran==
{{See also|Christianity and Islam|Islam and antisemitism|Islamic–Jewish relations|People of the Book}}

[[Jane Gerber]] claims that the Quran ascribes negative traits to Jews, such as cowardice, greed, and chicanery. She also alleges that the Quran associates Jews with interconfessional strife and rivalry ({{cite quran|2|113|style=ref}}), the Jewish belief that they alone are beloved of God ({{cite quran|5|18|style=ref}}), and that only they will achieve salvation ({{cite quran|2|111|style=ref}}).&lt;ref&gt;Gerber (1986), pp. 78–79 "Anti-Semitism and the Muslim World". In History and Hate: The Dimensions of Anti-Semitism, ed. David Berger. Jewish Publications Society. {{ISBN|0-8276-0267-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Encyclopedia Judaica]]'', the Qur'an contains many attacks on Jews and Christians for their refusal to recognize [[Muhammad]] as a prophet.&lt;ref&gt;[[Leon Poliakov|Poliakov, Leon]] (1997). "Anti-Semitism". ''[[Encyclopedia Judaica]]'' (CD-ROM Edition Version 1.0). Ed. [[Cecil Roth]]. Keter Publishing House. {{ISBN|965-07-0665-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Muslim view, the [[crucifixion of Jesus]] was an illusion, and thus the Jewish plots against him ended in failure.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1999), p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; In numerous verses&lt;ref&gt;See, for example from Gerber 91, {{cite quran|3|63|style=nosup|expand=no}}; {{cite quran|3|71|style=nosup|expand=no}}; {{cite quran|4|46|style=nosup|expand=no}}; {{cite quran|4|160|end=161|style=nosup|expand=no}}; {{cite quran|5|41|end=44|style=nosup|expand=no}}, {{cite quran|5|63|end=64|style=nosup|expand=no}}, {{cite quran|5|82|style=nosup|expand=no}}; {{cite quran|6|92|style=nosup|expand=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Qur'an accuses Jews of [[tahrif|altering the Scripture]].&lt;ref&gt;Gerber 78&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Karen Armstrong]] claims that there are "far more numerous passages in the [[Qur'an]]" which speak positively of the [[Jew]]s and their great prophets, than those which were against the "rebellious [[Jew]]ish tribes of Medina" (during [[Muhammad]]'s time).&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{Cite book|first=Sayyid Abul Ala|last=Maududi|title=[[The Meaning of the Qur'an (book)|The Meaning of the Quran]]|year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abul Ala Maududi|Sayyid Abul Ala]] believes the punishments were not meant for all Jews, and that they were only meant for the Jewish inhabitants that were sinning at the time.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; According to historian [[John V. Tolan|John Tolan]], the Quran contains a verse which criticizes the Christian worship of [[Jesus Christ]] as God, amongst other critiques of Jewish and Christian practices and doctrines. Despite this, the Quran has high praise for these religions, regarding them as the other two parts of the Abrahamic trinity.&lt;ref&gt;[[John V. Tolan|Tolan, John]], Europe and the Islamic World, Part 1, Chapter 5, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

The Christian doctrine of the [[Trinity]] states that God is a single being who exists, simultaneously and eternally, as a communion of three distinct persons, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. In Islam such [[Islamic view of the Trinity|plurality in God]] is a denial of [[Tawhid|monotheism]] ([https://quran.com/9/1-15 Quran 9:1–15]) and thus a [[Islamic views on sin|sin]] of [[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=focLrox-frUC&amp;pg=PA429&amp;dq=shirk+Islam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=shirk%2520Islam&amp;f=false|title=The New Encyclopedia of Islam|last=Glassé|first=Cyril|last2=Smith|first2=Huston|date=2003-01-01|publisher=Rowman Altamira|isbn=9780759101906|page=429|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is considered to be a major 'al-Kaba'ir' sin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamicbookstore.com/b2448.html  |title=The Major Sins : Arabic Text and English Translation of "Al Kaba'ir" (Muhammad Bin Uthman Adh Dhahabi) |work =Millat Book Centre| translator= Mohammad Moinuddin Siddiqui |editor=M. al Selek |isbn = 1-56744-489-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.jannah.org/articles/sins.html |title=The Major Sins: Al-Kaba'r |work =Jannah.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hindu criticism==
Hindu Swami [[Dayanand Saraswati]] gave a brief analysis of the Quran in the 14th chapter of his 19th-century book [[Satyarth Prakash]]. He calls the concept of Islam to be highly offensive, and doubted that there is any connection of Islam with God:

{{quotation|Had the God of the [[Quran]] been the Lord of all creatures, and been Merciful and kind to all, he would never have commanded the Mohammedans to slaughter men of other faiths, and animals, etc. If he is Merciful, will he show mercy even to the sinners? If the answer be given in the affirmative, it cannot be true, because further on it is said in the Quran "Put infidels to sword," in other words, he that does not believe in the Quran and the Prophet Mohammad is an infidel (he should, therefore, be put to death). Since the Quran sanctions such cruelty to non-Mohammedans and innocent creatures such as cows it can never be the Word of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Journal of Indian Council of Philosophical Research |volume =19 |issue =1|publisher = ICPR| year = 2002|page = 73}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On the other hand, [[Mahatma Gandhi]], the moral leader of the 20th-century Indian independence movement, found the Quran to be peaceful, but the history of Muslims to be aggressive, while he claimed that Hindus have passed that stage of societal evolution:

{{quotation|Though, in my opinion, non-violence has a predominant place in the Quran, the thirteen hundred years of imperialistic expansion has made the Muslims fighters as a body. They are therefore aggressive. Bullying is the natural excrescence of an aggressive spirit. The Hindu has an ages old civilization. He is essentially non violent. His civilization has passed through the experiences that the two recent ones are still passing through. If Hinduism was ever imperialistic in the modern sense of the term, it has outlived its imperialism and has either deliberately or as a matter of course given it up. Predominance of the non-violent spirit has restricted the use of arms to a small minority which must always be subordinate to a civil power highly spiritual, learned and selfless.&lt;ref&gt;''The Gandhian Moment'', p. 117, by Ramin Jahanbegloo&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Gandhi's responses to Islam'', p. 110, by Sheila McDonough&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:dongchu.jpg|260px|thumb|right|''Ven. Dongchu at the door of CHIBC'']]
'''Dongchu''' ({{zh|c=東初|p=Dōngchū}}, 1907–1977) was a [[Chinese people|Chinese]] [[Ch'an]] Master in Mainland [[China]] and later in [[Taiwan]], and also the teacher of respected modern-day Ch'an Master [[Sheng-yen]]. He is the 51st generation of [[Zen]] patriarch from the [[Caodong]] School ([http://www.westernchanfellowship.org/lineage-chart-en.html See Lineage Chart]). He also established several monasteries and organizations in Taiwan that continue to exist and expand to this very day, including [[Chung-hwa Institute of Buddhist Culture]](CHIBC) and [[Nung Chan]] Monastery.

He was born in [[Jiangsu]] province, [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dharmadrum.org/about/about.aspx?cid=C_00000016&amp;ccid=C_00000017 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070813194123/http://www.dharmadrum.org/about/about.aspx?cid=C_00000016&amp;ccid=C_00000017 |archivedate=2007-08-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At his early education period, he studied with various prominent monks such as Master Aiting and Master Nanting from the Zhulin Buddhist Institute in [[Zhenjiang]]. He then pursues his study further at Minnan Buddhist Institute in [[Xiamen]], and studied under renowned scholar-monk and modernist Master [[Taixu]]. His peers in the institute include Master [[Yinshun]], Zhumo, and Cihang (Tzuhang) – all of whom also became influential monks.

After graduated from Minnan Buddhist Institute, Ven. Dongchu then became [[dean (education)|dean]] of the prestigious school Jiaoshan Buddhist Institute. At the same time, he was abbot of the [[Dinghui Monastery]] in [[Zhenjiang]], [[Jiangsu]] province. Dinghui Monastery (''Monastery of Samadhi and Wisdom'') was a very famous [[Ch'an]] monastery in China, it stands on an island in the [[Yangtze River]], on a hill called ''Floating Jade Mountain''. It was first built around 194-195 [[Common Era|CE]] and changed names several times before finally became Dinghui Monastery during [[Qing Dynasty]]. He also taught classes at several other Buddhist institutes, including Jingan Si(''Quiet Calm'') Academy in [[Shanghai]] – at which young [[Sheng-yen]], who was studying there, first encountered him. Ven. Dongchu had a reputation as a progressive thinker who, unlike most [[Buddhist monk|monks]] at his time, wouldn't hesitate to criticize others. He was also known as a fierce teacher and his students gave him the nickname the 'Big Gun'. His paradigm was much influence by his teacher, [[Taixu]].&lt;ref&gt;Sheng Yen, Footprints in the Snow: The Autobiography of a Chinese Buddhist Monk. Doubleday Religion, 2008. {{ISBN|978-0-385-51330-2}}. 
&lt;/ref&gt;

He also became the first permanent council member in the [[Buddhist Association of the Republic of China]] in 1947. But it didn't last long as within the next couple of years, the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]] drove [[Kuomintang|Nationalists]] out of the [[Mainland China]], and many religious leaders, in fear of the Communists' persecution, fled overseas – including Ven. Dongchu, who fled to Taiwan at 1949.

He took temporary shelter at [[Beitou District|Beitou]], near [[Taipei]], at the Fazang Monastery. Three months later, his passion for Buddhist education and culture led him to start the ''Humanity'' Magazine – the first Buddhist [[periodical]] in Taiwan. Its mission is to "purify the minds of the people and establish Life Buddhism." By the early 1950s, it had grown very popular and its circulation reached Southeast Asia and East Asia, and the United States.

Ven. Dongchu established his first monastery in [[Taiwan]] at 1955. It was located in [[Beitou District|Beitou]], near [[Taipei]], and was completed a year later. Instead of naming it a 'monastery', he named it [[Chung-Hwa Institute of Buddhist Culture]] (CHIBC) to establish a foundation for cultural work. In 1956, he started a charity program called 'Winter Relief Drive' to collect donations to buy rice, oil, and winter clothing for poor families and orphanages in Beitou, [[Tamsui District|Tamsui]], [[Sanchong District|Sanchong]], [[Yilan County, Taiwan|Yilan]], [[Taoyuan City|Taoyuan]], and [[Xinzhuang District|Xinzhuang]]. Therefore, they could celebrate [[Chinese New Year]] with warmth and meal.

Ven. [[Sheng-yen]], who had been an active writer in the ''Humanity'' Magazine under his pen-name ''Xing Shi Jiang Jun'' ("World Awakening General"), became Ven. Dongchu's disciple in 1959. Ven. Sheng-yen was a soldier in the [[intelligence]] unit at that time, he joined the [[ROC Army|Army]] unwillingly in order to escape from [[Mainland China]]. Despite his position in the intelligence, Ven. Sheng-yen's request to be dismissed from his post was accepted by his superior with Ven. Dongchu's help.

Aside from his intellectual and charity activities, Ven. Dongchu didn't spend much time leading Buddhist ceremonies or rituals. In his later years, he rarely went out to focus on his writings. Thus, he didn't have many followers and disciples. However, he was persistent and in the 1960s he bought a 2.5 [[acres]] of land in the Guandu Plain, near [[Taipei]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dharmadrum.org/about/about.aspx?cid=C_00000016&amp;ccid=C_00000018 ]{{dead link|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:dongchu2.jpg|240px|thumb|left|Ven.

In the beginning it only serves as a farmland cultivated by Ven. Dongchu and his two disciples – Ven. [[Sheng-yen]] was in solitary retreat at southern Taiwan by the time. Step by step, he built a farmhouse, and after four years of works, he succeeded to establish another monastery, [[Nung Chan]] Monastery in 1975. In Nung Chan, meaning ''Farming Ch'an'', the residents practice [[Ch'an]] while grow their own food. They live by the famous aphorism by Zen Master [[Baizhang Huaihai]], "A day without work is a day without food". The monastery was dedicated to Bodhisattva [[Manjusri]], which symbolizes great wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dharmadrum.org/about/about.aspx?cid=C_00000042 ]{{dead link|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, Ven. Dongchu had a chance to visit his disciple Ven. Sheng-yen in New York. Ven. Sheng-yen was an abbot of a small monastery at the [[Bronx]] and he succeeded to gain a number of Western followers. They both had parted long before. Ven. Sheng-yen went to six-years solitary retreat in 1961. He then studied in Japan for some years and earned a doctorate degree before arriving in United States.

Ven. Dongchu died in 1977 in sitting position with no clear illness. In his last will he passed down the abbotship of CHIBC and [[Nung Chan]] to Ven. Sheng-yen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://info.taiwan.net.tw/tourbusE/december_page1.html |title=Come to Taiwan,Return with good memories |publisher=Info.taiwan.net.tw |date= |accessdate=2014-06-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227183910/http://info.taiwan.net.tw/tourbusE/december_page1.html |archivedate=2012-02-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His ashes, which were kept in CHIBC before, were buried in the Life Memorial Garden of [[Dharma Drum Mountain]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dharmadrum.org/news/news-detail.aspx?cid=C_00000009&amp;pid=P_00000069 ]{{dead link|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese name of New York City's Ch'an Meditation Center(東初禪寺） is named after Ven. Master Dongchu by his disciple Ven. Master [[Sheng-yen]].

The '''Dutch Reformed Church in Botswana''' was founded by [[Swiss]] missionaries led by Rev. Henri Gronin begun working in 1863 among the tribe [[Bakgatla]], [[Kgafela]] in [[Saulsport]] and [[Rustenburg]] in [[South Africa]]. In 1870 part of the tribe moved north to [[Botswana]] and the missionaries followed them. The great chief was baptised and most of the tribe followed him. In 1966 when Botswana become independent, a Synod of the Reformed Church was formed. In the 1970s the church gained independence. The church in the following years expanded to [[Basarwa]], [[Bakalanga]] and [[Bakgatla]].&lt;ref name="reformiert-online1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Johannes a Lasco Library |url=http://www.reformiert-online.net/adressen/detail.php?id=1271&amp;lg=eng |title=Address data base of Reformed churches and institutions |publisher=Reformiert-online.net |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The act of rebuilding the mounds, of adding additional layers of earth over [[burial]]s, served as a [[symbol]] of renewal, which renewed the [[Earthworks (art)|earthwork]] as much as human life. The earthen platform served as the [[earth]], a symbolism which endured into historic times. There are historically documented connections between additions to platforms mounds and the communal "[[Green Corn Ceremony]]", which celebrated the new [[harvest]] and the [[fertility]] of the earth. The quadrilateral, flat-topped design of many platform mounds may represent the Southeastern American Indian belief that the earth was a flat surface oriented towards four quarters of the world.&lt;ref name=Emerson/&gt;

A '''flaming sword''' is a sword glowing with flame by some [[supernatural]] power. Flaming swords have existed in legend and myth for thousands of years. 

In Sumerian mythology, the deity known as [[Asaruludu]] is "the wielder of the flaming sword" who "ensures the most perfect safety".

According to the [[Bible]], a [[cherub]] (or the [[archangel]] [[Uriel]] in some traditions) with a flaming sword was placed by God at the gates of [[Paradise]] after [[Adam and Eve]] were banished from it ([[wikisource:The Old Testament (Vulgate)/Genesis|Genesis]] 3:24). 

[[Eastern Orthodox]] tradition says that after [[Jesus]] was crucified and resurrected, the flaming sword was removed from the [[Garden of Eden]], making it possible for humanity to re-enter Paradise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ocf.org/OrthodoxPage/prayers/triodion/lent3sat Orthodox liturgy of the third Sunday of Lent]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Welsh mythology]] the ''Dyrnwyn'' ("White-Hilt") is said to be a powerful sword belonging to [[Riderch I of Alt Clut|Rhydderch Hael]],&lt;ref&gt;''Tri Thlws ar Ddeg'', ed. and tr. Bromwich (1978): pp. 240–241.&lt;/ref&gt; one of the Three Generous Men of Britain mentioned in the [[Welsh Triads]]. When drawn by a worthy or well-born man, the entire blade would blaze with fire. Rhydderch was never reluctant to hand the weapon to anyone, hence his nickname ''Hael'' "the Generous", but the recipients, as soon as they had learned of its peculiar properties, always rejected the sword. Its fire would burn the man who drew it for an unworthy purpose.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zGiuBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA90&amp;dq=Tri+Thlws+ar+Ddeg,+ed.+and+tr.+Bromwich+dyrnwyn#v=onepage&amp;q=Tri%20Thlws%20ar%20Ddeg%2C%20ed.%20and%20tr.%20Bromwich%20dyrnwyn&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

The sword wielded by [[Surtr]], a [[jotunn]] of [[Muspelheim]] is a flaming sword with immense destructive power that appears in [[Norse mythology]].&lt;ref&gt;Faulkes (1995:9–10)&lt;/ref&gt;

The sword [[Acala]] holds may or may not be flaming and sometimes described only generically as a {{Nihongo|treasure sword|宝剣|hōken}} or as {{Nihongo|vajra-sword|金剛杵|kongō-ken}}, which is descriptive of the fact that the pommel of the sword is in the shape of the talon-like {{Nihongo|[[vajra]]|金剛杵|kongō-sho}} of one type or another.

[[Dumah (angel)|Dumah]] is an angel mentioned in Rabbinical literature. Dumah is a popular figure in [[Yiddish]] folklore. [[I. B. Singer]]'s ''Short Friday'' (1964), a collection of stories, mentions Dumah as a "thousand-eyed angel of death, armed with a flaming sword".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="92030">'''Forced conversion''' is adoption of a different religion or irreligion under [[Coercion|duress]]. Some who have been forced to convert may continue, covertly, with the beliefs and practices originally held, while outwardly behaving as converts. [[Crypto-Judaism|Crypto-Jews]], [[Crypto-Christianity|crypto-Christians]], [[Crypto-Islam|crypto-Muslims]] and [[Crypto-paganism|crypto-Pagans]] are historical examples of the latter.

== Religion and power ==
In general, [[anthropologists]] have shown that the relationship between [[religion and politics]] is complex, especially when viewed over the expanse of human history.&lt;ref name=Firth&gt;Firth, Raymond (1981) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/676754 Spiritual Aroma: Religion and Politics]. ''American Anthropologist'', New Series, Vol. 83, No. 3, pp. 582–601&lt;/ref&gt; While religious leaders and the state generally have different aims, both are concerned with power and order; both use reason and emotion to motivate behavior. Throughout history, leaders of religious and political institutions have cooperated, opposed one another, or attempted to co-opt each other, for purposes both noble and base, and have implemented programs with a wide range of driving values, from compassion aimed at alleviating current suffering to brutal change aimed at achieving longer-term goals, for the benefit of groups ranging from small cliques to all of humanity. The relationship is far from simple. But religion has often been used coercively, and has used coercion.&lt;ref name=Firth/&gt;

== Judaism ==
Forced conversions occurred under the [[Hasmonean dynasty|Hasmonean Kingdom]]. The [[Idumea]]ns were forced to convert to Judaism, by threat of exile or death, depending on the source.&lt;ref&gt;Flavius Josephus Antiquities 13.257–258&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristobulus I|Aristobulus]]&lt;/ref&gt;
In ''Eusebíus, Christianity, and Judaism'', [[Harold W. Attridge]] claims that "there is reason to think that [[Josephus]]' account of their conversion is substantially accurate." He also writes: "that these were not isolated instances, but that forced conversion was a national policy, is clear from the fact that [[Alexander Jannaeus]] (around 80 BC) demolished the city of [[Pella, Jordan|Pella]] in [[Moab]], 'because the inhabitants would not agree to adopt the national custom of the Jews.'" Josephus, Antiquities. 13.15.4.&lt;ref&gt;Harold W. Attridge, Gōhei Hata (eds). ''Eusebius, Christianity, and Judaism'' Wayne State University Press, 1992: p. 387&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maurice Sartre]] has written of the "policy of forced Judaization adopted by [[John Hyrcanus|Hyrcanos]], [[Aristobulus I]] and [[Jannaeus]]", who offered "the conquered peoples a choice between expulsion or conversion,"&lt;ref&gt;[[Maurice Sartre]]. ''The Middle East Under Rome''. Harvard University Press, 2005: p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; William Horbury has written that "The evidence is best explained by postulating that an existing small Jewish population in Lower Galilee was massively expanded by the forced conversion in c.104 BC of their Gentile neighbours in the north."&lt;ref&gt;William Horbury. ''The Cambridge History of Judaism 2 Part Set: Volume 3, The Early Roman Period'' Cambridge University Press, 1999: p. 599&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2009 the [[BBC]] defended a claim that in AD 524 the [[Yemen]]i Jewish [[Himyar]] tribe, led by King [[Dhu Nuwas]], had offered Christian residents of a village in what is now [[Saudi Arabia]] the choice between conversion to Judaism or death, and that 20,000 Christians had then been massacred. The BBC stated that "The production team spoke to many historians over 18 months, among them [[Nigel Groom]], who was our consultant, and Professor [[Abdul Rahman Al-Ansary]] [former professor of archaeology at the [[King Saud University]] in [[Riyadh]]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/historians-back-bbc-over-jewish-massacre-claim |title=Historians back BBC over Jewish massacre claim &amp;#124; The Jewish Chronicle |publisher=Thejc.com |date=2009-09-18 |accessdate=2014-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inscriptions documented by Yousef himself show the great pride he expressed after massacring more than 22,000 Christians in [[Zafar, Yemen|Zafar]] and [[Najran]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Ryckmans, La persécution des chrétiens himyarites au sixième siècle, Nederlands Historisch-Archaeologisch Inst. in het Nabije Oosten, 1956 pp 1-24&lt;/ref&gt;

== Christianity ==
{{See also|Christianization|Classical antiquity}}
[[Early Christianity|Christianity]] was a minority religion during much of middle [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Classical antiquity|Classical Period]], and [[Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire|the early Christians were persecuted during that time]]. When [[Constantine the Great and Christianity|Constantine I converted to Christianity]], it became the dominant religion in the Roman Empire. Already under the reign of Constantine I, [[Heresy#Christianity|Christian heretics]] had been persecuted; beginning in the late 4th century, the [[Persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire|ancient pagan religions were also actively suppressed]]. In the view of many historians, the [[Constantinian shift]] turned Christianity from a persecuted religion into one capable of persecution and sometimes eager to persecute.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. John Coffey, ''Persecution and Toleration on Protestant England 1558–1689'', 2000, p.22&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Late Antiquity ===
{{See also|State church of the Roman Empire}}
On 27 February 380, together with [[Gratian]] and [[Valentinian II]], [[Theodosius I]] issued the decree ''Cunctos populos'', the so-called [[Edict of Thessalonica]], recorded in the [[Codex Theodosianus]] [[:la:s:Codex Theodosianus – Liber XVI#I.2|xvi.1.2]]. This declared [[Trinitarianism|Trinitarian]] [[Nicene Christianity]] to be the only legitimate imperial religion and the only one entitled to call itself [[Catholic]]. Other Christians he described as "foolish madmen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/theodcodeXVI.html|title=Medieval Sourcebook: Theodosian Code XVI|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also ended official state support for the traditional [[polytheist]] religions and customs.&lt;ref name="KaylorPhillips2012"&gt;{{citation|author1=Noel Harold Kaylor|author2=Philip Edward Phillips|title=A Companion to Boethius in the Middle Ages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B_secKlFKB0C&amp;pg=PA14|accessdate=19 January 2013|date=3 May 2012|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-18354-4|pages=14–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Codex Theodosianus]]'' (Eng. Theodosian Code) was a compilation of the [[Roman law|laws]] of the [[Roman Empire]] under the [[Christian]] emperors since 312. A commission was established by [[Theodosius II]] and his [[Tetrarchy|co-emperor]] [[Valentinian III]] on 26 March 429&lt;ref name=Oxf&gt;"Codex Theodosianus" in ''[[Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium|The Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium]]'', [[Oxford University Press]], New York &amp; Oxford, 1991, p. 475. {{ISBN|0195046528}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Codex_Theodosianus.html LacusCurtius • Roman Law — Theodosian Code (Smith's Dictionary, 1875)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and the compilation was published by a constitution of 15 February 438.

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is Our will that all the peoples who are ruled by the administration of Our Clemency shall practice that religion which the divine Peter the Apostle transmitted to the Romans.... The rest, whom We adjudge demented and insane, shall sustain the infamy of heretical dogmas, their meeting places shall not receive the name of churches, and they shall be smitten first by divine vengeance and secondly by the retribution of Our own initiative (Codex Theodosianus XVI 1.2.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Theodosian Code and Novels and the Sirmondian Constitutions |year=1952 |translator-last=Pharr |translator-first=Clyde}}, qtd. in {{cite web |last=Grout |first=James|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/greece/paganism/paganism.html |title=The End of Paganism |date=1 October 2014 |accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[History of Jewish conversion to Christianity|Forced conversions of Jews]] were carried out with the support of rulers during [[Late Antiquity]] and the early [[Middle Ages]] in [[Gaul]], the [[Iberian peninsula]] and in the [[Byzantine empire]].&lt;ref name=soyer&gt;{{cite book|author=F.J.F. Soyer|title=The Persecution of the Jews and Muslims of Portugal King Manuel I and the End of Religious Tolerance (1496-7)|date=2007|publisher=Brill|isbn=9789047431558|url= http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/books/9789047431558|subscription=yes|via=Brill|pages=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medieval western Europe ===
During the [[Saxon Wars]], [[Charlemagne]], [[King of the Franks]], forcibly converted the [[Saxons]] from their native [[Germanic paganism]] by way of warfare, and law upon conquest. Examples are the [[Massacre of Verden]] in 782, when Charlemagne reportedly had 4,500 captive Saxons massacred upon rebelling against conversion, and the ''[[Capitulatio de partibus Saxoniae]]'', a law imposed on conquered Saxons in 785 that prescribed death to those who refused to convert to Christianity.&lt;ref name="CHARLEMAGNE"&gt;For the Massacre of Verden, see Barbero, Alessandro (2004). ''Charlemagne: Father of a Continent'', page 46. [[University of California Press]]. For the ''Capitulatio de partibus Saxoniae'', see Riché, Pierre (1993). ''The Carolingians''. [[University of Pennsylvania Press]]. {{ISBN|978-0-8122-1342-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Forced conversion that occurred after the seventh century generally took place during riots and massacres carried out by mobs and clergy without support of the rulers. In contrast, royal persecutions of Jews from the late eleventh century onward generally took form of expulsions, with some exceptions, such as conversions of Jews in southern Italy of the 13th century, which were carried out by Dominican Inquisitors but instigated by King Charles II of Naples.&lt;ref name=soyer/&gt;

Jews were forced to convert to Christianity by the Crusaders in Lorraine, on the Lower Rhine, in Bavaria and Bohemia, in Mainz and in Worms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Abraham Joshua Heschel, Joachim Neugroschel, Sylvia Heschel|title=Maimonides: A Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ki6a7WsZYwMC&amp;pg=PA43|page=43|publisher=Macmillan|year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Rhineland massacres]], [[Worms massacre (1096)]])

[[Pope Innocent III]] pronounced in 1201 that if one agreed to be baptized to avoid torture and intimidation, one nevertheless could be compelled to outwardly observe Christianity:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]hose who are immersed even though reluctant, do belong to ecclesiastical jurisdiction at least by reason of the sacrament, and might therefore be reasonably compelled to observe the rules of the Christian Faith. It is, to be sure, contrary to the Christian Faith that anyone who is unwilling and wholly opposed to it should be compelled to adopt and observe Christianity. For this reason a valid distinction is made by some between kinds of unwilling ones and kinds of compelled ones. Thus one who is drawn to Christianity by violence, through fear and through torture, and receives the sacrament of Baptism in order to avoid loss, he (like one who comes to Baptism in dissimulation) does receive the impress of Christianity, and may be forced to observe the Christian Faith as one who expressed a conditional willingness though, absolutely speaking, he was unwilling ...&lt;ref&gt;Chazan, Robert, ed., Church, State, and Jew in the Middle Ages, West Orange, NJ:Behrman House, 1980, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the [[Northern Crusades]] against the pagan Balts and Slavs of northern Europe, forced conversions were a widely used tactic, which received papal sanction &lt;ref&gt; Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades. London: Penguin Books. pg. 71&lt;/ref&gt;. These tactics were first adopted during the [[Wendish Crusade]], but became more widespread during the [[Livonian Crusade]] and [[Prussian Crusade]], in which tactics including the killing of hostages, massacre, and the devastation of the lands of tribes that had not yet submitted &lt;ref&gt; Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades. London: Penguin Books. pg. 95&lt;/ref&gt;. Most of the populations of these regions were converted only after the repeated rebellion of native populations that did not want to accept Christianity even after initial forced conversion; in Old Prussia, the tactics employed in the initial conquest and subsequent conversion of the territory resulted in the death of most of the native population, whose [[Old Prussian|language]] consequently became extinct. &lt;ref&gt;''The German Hansa'', P. Dollinger, page 34, 1999, Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

After the forced conversion, when all former Muslims and Jews had ostensibly become Catholic, the [[Spanish Inquisition]] targeted primarily forced converts from Judaism, who came under suspicion of either continuing to adhere to their old religion or having fallen back into it. Jewish conversos still resided in Spain and often practised [[Judaism]] secretly and were suspected by the "Old Christians" of being [[Crypto-Jew]]s. The Spanish Inquisition generated much wealth and income for the church and individual inquisitors by confiscating the property of the persecuted. The end of [[Al-Andalus]] and the [[Alhambra Decree|expulsion of the Sephardic Jews]] from the Iberian Peninsula went hand in hand with the increase of Spanish and Portuguese influence in the world, as exemplified in the Christian conquest of the Americas and their aboriginal Indian population. The [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Morocco]] absorbed most of the Jewish refugees, although a large majority remained as Conversos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110108184056/http://www.thejerusalemconnection.us/news-archive/tag/inquisition |title=3000 Years of Sephardic History |website=The Jerusalem Connection, International |url=http://www.thejerusalemconnection.us/news-archive/tag/inquisition |dead-url=yes |archive-date=8 January 2011 |last=Neese |first=Shelley |date=17 November 2008 |access-date=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colonial Americas=== 
During the [[European colonization of the Americas]], forced conversion of the continents' indigenous, non-Christian population was common, especially in [[South America]] and [[Mesoamerica]], where the conquest of large indigenous polities like the [[Inca]] and [[Aztec]]Empires placed colonizers in control of large non-Christian populations. Historians broadly agree that most native populations that converted did so under the threat of violence, often because they were compelled to after being conquered, and that the Catholic Church cooperated with civil authority to achieve this end. &lt;ref&gt; Fisher, Ian.

=== Goa inquisition ===
{{Main|Goa Inquisition}}
The Portuguese practised religious persecution in [[Goa]], India in the 16th and 17th centuries. The natives of Goa, most of them Hindus, were subjected to [[Goa Inquisition|severe torture and oppression]] by the zealous Portuguese rulers and missionaries, and forcibly converted to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RS1uAAAAMAAJ Of umbrellas, goddesses, and dreams: essays on Goan culture and society], 76-120, Robert Samuel Newman, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[The Goa Inquisition (book)|The Goa Inquisition, Being a Quatercentenary Commemoration Study of the Inquisition in India]] by Anant Priolkar, Bombay University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hSnn_kDUI6AC&amp;pg=PA69 Everyday Nationalism: Women of the Hindu Right in India] Kalyani Devaki Menon, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ftS1AAAAIAAJ Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bombay] 1967&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M.

In 1567, the campaign to destroy temples in [[Bardez]] met with success, with 300 Hindu temples destroyed. Prohibition was laid from December 4, 1567 on rituals of Hindu marriages, sacred thread wearing and cremation. All persons above 15 years of age were compelled to listen to Christian preaching, failing which they were punished. In 1583, Hindu temples at [[Assolna]] and [[Cuncolim]] were destroyed by the Portuguese army. "The fathers of the Church forbade the Hindus under terrible penalties the use of their own sacred books, and prevented them from all exercise of their religion. They destroyed their temples, and so harassed and interfered with the people that they abandoned the city in large numbers, refusing to remain any longer in a place where they had no liberty, and were liable to imprisonment, torture and death if they worshiped after their own fashion the gods of their fathers", wrote Filippo [[Sassetti]], who was in India from 1578 to 1588. An order was issued in June 1684 for suppressing the [[Konkani]] language and making it compulsory to speak Portuguese, on pain of severe penalties. All non-Christian cultural symbols and books written in local languages were also ordered to be destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/28411503/Goa-Inquisition-for-Colonial-Disciplining |title=Goa Inquisition for Colonial Disciplining |publisher=Scribd.com |date=2010-03-15 |accessdate=2012-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The verse, however, has been understood over the centuries as a general command that people cannot be forced to convert to Islam.}}&lt;/ref&gt; episodes of forced conversions are recorded in the [[history of Islam]]. Historians have qualified such instances as "rare"&lt;ref name="W53"&gt;Waines (2003) "An Introduction to Islam" ''Cambridge University Press''. p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; or "exceptional".&lt;ref name=bonner/&gt;

While scholars like [[Abu Hanifa]] and [[Abu Yusuf]] stated that jizya should be imposed all non-Muslims without distinction, some later and more extremist jurists do not permit jizya for idolators and instead only allowed the choice of conversion to avoid death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Proceedings of the Indian History Congress|volume=9|title=Political conditions of the Hindus under the Khaljis|publisher=[[Indian History Congress]]|author=[[Kishori Saran Lal]]|pages= 232}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of the four [[madhab|schools of Islamic law]], the [[Hanafi]] and [[Maliki]] schools allow the ''[[dhimmi]]'' status for polytheists except Arab polytheists.

[[Wael Hallaq]] states that in theory, Islamic religious tolerance applied only to monotheistic "[[People of the Book]]" like Christians, Jews and [[Zoroastrians|Magians]] if they paid the ''[[jizya]]'' tax, and pagans faced only two choices between conversion to Islam and fight to the death. In practice, the designation "People of the Book" and the [[dhimma]] status was extended even to non-monotheistic religions of conquered peoples, such as [[Hindus]], Jains, Buddhists and other non-monotheists.&lt;ref name=hallaq&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eVJsAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA327|author=Wael B.

In recent times, forced conversions have been threatened or carried out in the context of war, insurgency and intercommunal violence. Cases affecting thousands of people are reported to have occurred during the [[Partition of India]], the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]], in areas controlled by [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]], and in [[Pakistan]]. Disputed allegations of forced conversion of young women have generated public controversy in Egypt and the UK.

=== Early period ===
The [[Ridda Wars|wars of the Ridda]] (lit. apostasy), undertaken by the first caliph [[Abu Bakr]] against tribes who had accepted Islam but refused to recognize his caliphal authority have been described by some authors as an instance of forced conversion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Conversion|author=Richard W. Bullient|editor=Gerhard Böwering, Patricia Crone|encyclopedia=The Princeton Encyclopedia of Islamic Political Thought|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "reconversion".&lt;ref name=lewis2002&gt;{{Cite book|first=Bernard|last=Lewis| authorlink = Bernard Lewis | year=2002 | title=Arabs in History|publisher=Oxford University Press (Kindle edition) | page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; The action of these tribes was less a relapse to paganism than termination of a political contract they had made with [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref name=lewis2002/&gt;

Two out of the four schools of Islamic law, i.e. Hanafi and Maliki schools, accepted non-Arab polytheists to be eligible for the ''dhimmi'' status. Under this doctrine, Arab polytheists were forced to choose between conversion and death. However, according to perception of most jurists, all Arabs had embraced Islam during the lifetime of Muhammad. Their exclusion therefore had little practical significance after his death in 632.&lt;ref name=Bowering/&gt;

In the 9th century, the [[Samaritan]] population of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] faced persecution and attempts at forced conversion at the hands of the rebel leader ibn Firāsa, against whom they were defended by Abbasid caliphal troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Moshe Gil|title=A History of Palestine, 634-1099|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tSM4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA822|publisher=CUP Archive|page=822|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Almohad dynasty ===
There were forced conversions in the 12th century under the [[Almohad]] dynasty of North Africa and [[al-Andalus|Andalusia]], who suppressed the [[dhimma]] status of Jews and Christians and gave them the choice between conversion, exile, and being killed. Christians under their rule generally chose to relocate to the Christian principalities in the north of the peninsula, while Jews decided to stay in order to keep their properties, and many of them feigned conversion to Islam, while continuing their religious practices in secrecy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia| author=Maribel Fierro | entry=The Almohads (524 668/1130 1269) and the Hafsids (627 932/1229 1526) |title=The New Cambridge History of Islam|volume=Volume 2, The Western Islamic World, Eleventh to Eighteenth Centuries |publisher=Cambridge University Press |ref=harv |year=2010 |editor=Maribel Fierro|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Almohad persecution, the Jewish philosopher [[Maimonides]] wrote his ''Epistle on Apostasy'', in which he permitted Jews to feign apostasy under duress, though strongly recommending leaving the country instead.&lt;ref name=fine&gt;{{cite book|author=Lawrence Fine|title=Judaism in Practice: From the Middle Ages Through the Early Modern Period|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ohYOD34VlXEC&amp;pg=PA414|page=414}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is dispute amongst scholars as to whether Maimonides himself converted to Islam in order to freely escape from Almohad territory, and then reconverted back to Judaism in either the Levant or in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nysun.com/arts/the-great-rambam-joel-kramers-maimonides/86437/ |title=The Great Rambam: Joel Kraemer's 'Maimonides' – The New York Sun |publisher=Nysun.com |date=2008-09-24 |accessdate=2012-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later denounced as an apostate and tried in an Islamic court, but the [[Qadi|judge]] ruled that his conversion had been forced and therefore invalid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Bernard Lewis|title=The Jews of Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c0S4lOyfKSYC&amp;pg=PA100|page=100|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yemen===

In the late 1160s, the Yemenite ruler [['Abd-al-Nabī ibn Mahdi]] left Jews with the choice between conversion to Islam or [[martyrdom]].&lt;ref&gt;The Epistles of Maimonides: Crisis and Leadership, ed.:Abraham S. Halkin, David Hartman, Jewish Publication Society, 1985. p.91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Festschrift/&gt; Mahdi also imposed his beliefs upon the Muslims besides the Jews. This led to a revival of Jewish [[messianism]], but also led to mass-conversion.&lt;ref name=Festschrift&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dk6hAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA181|title=Jews, Christians and Muslims in Medieval and Early Modern Times: A Festschrift in Honor of Mark R.

According to two [[Cairo Genizah]] documents, the [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid]] ruler of Yemen, al-Malik al-Mu'izz al-Ismail (reigned from 1197-1202) had attempted to force the Jews of [[Aden]] to convert.

A form of forced conversion became institutionalized during the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the practice of [[devşirme]], a human levy in which Christian boys were seized and collected from their families (usually in the Balkans), enslaved, converted to Islam, and then trained as elite military unit within the Ottoman army or for high-ranking service to the sultan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |article=Conversion |first=Tijana |last=Krstić |title=Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire |editor1-first=Gábor |editor1-last=Ágoston |editor2-first=Bruce Alan |editor2-last=Masters |publisher=InfoBase Publishing |date=2009 |p=145–146 |quote="As a part of their education, devşirme children underwent compulsory conversion to Islam, which is the only documented forced form of conversion organized by the Ottoman state."}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the mid to late 14th, through early 18th centuries, the [[devşirme]]–[[janissary]] system enslaved an estimated 500,000 to one million non–Muslim adolescent males.&lt;ref&gt;A.

According to the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', in 2007, commissioner of police Sir [[Ian Blair]] stated the police were targeting extremist members of the Muslim community who were allegedly forcing vulnerable girls to convert to Islam in response to claims made by the Hindu Forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Police protect girls forced to convert to Islam |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-437871/Police-protect-girls-forced-convert-Islam.html|publisher=Daily Mail|accessdate=19 August 2013|date=22 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 a Sikh girl's family claimed that she had been forcibly converted to Islam, and they received a police guard after being attacked by an armed gang, although the "Police said no one was injured in the incident".&lt;ref name=bm2007&gt;{{cite web|last=Cowan|first=Mark|title=Police guard girl 'forced to become Muslim' |url=http://icbirmingham.icnetwork.co.uk/mail/news/tm_headline=police-guard-girl--forced-to-become-muslim-%26method=full%26objectid=19253457%26siteid=50002-name_page.html|publisher=Birmingham Mail|accessdate=19 August 2013|date=June 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to these news stories, an open letter to Sir Ian Blair, signed by ten Hindu academics, argued that claims that Hindu and Sikh girls were being forcefully converted were "part of an arsenal of myths propagated by right-wing Hindu supremacist organisations in India".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Islamic Human Rights Commission]]|title='Forced Conversions' Myth Mongering By British Police|date=Feb 25, 2007|accessdate=Jul 4, 2017|url=http://www.ihrc.org.uk/show.php?id=2511}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- I can't find it at https://www.theguardian.com/tone/letters/2007/feb/25/all, but it's also at https://www.mail-archive.com/sacw@insaf.net/msg00559.html --&gt; The [[Muslim Council of Britain]] issued a press release pointing out there is a lack of evidence of any forced conversions and suggested it is an underhand attempt to smear the British Muslim population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |author=Muslim Council of Britain |date=8 March 2007 |title=MCB calls for evidence of alleged 'forced conversions' |location=London, UK |publisher=Author |url=http://www.mcb.org.uk/mcb-calls-for-evidence-of-alleged-forced-conversions/ |access-date=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An academic paper by Katy Sian published in the journal ''South Asian Popular Culture'' in 2011 explored the question of how "'forced' conversion narratives" arose around the [[Sikhism in the United Kingdom|Sikh diaspora in the United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=Forced&gt;{{cite journal | title = 'Forced' conversions in the British Sikh diaspora | first=Katy P. |last=Sian |date=2011 |journal = South Asian Popular Culture |volume=9 |issue=2 |p=115–130 |doi=10.1080/14746681003798060}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sian, who reports that claims of conversion through courtship on campuses are widespread in the UK, indicates that rather than relying on actual evidence they primarily rest on the word of "a friend of a friend" or on personal [[anecdote]]. According to Sian, the narrative is similar to accusations of "[[Human trafficking|white slavery]]" lodged against the Jewish community and foreigners to the UK and the US, with the former having ties to [[anti-semitism]] that mirror the [[Islamophobia]] betrayed by the modern narrative. Sian expanded on these views in 2013's ''Mistaken Identities, Forced Conversions, and Postcolonial Formations''.&lt;ref name="Sian2013"&gt;{{cite book|first=Katy P. |last=Sian |title=Unsettling Sikh and Muslim Conflict: Mistaken Identities, Forced Conversions, and Postcolonial Formations |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-9AZ2atcd-kC&amp;pg=PA55 |accessdate=15 June 2013|date=2013|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7391-7874-4|pages=55–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hinduism ==
Indian Christians have alleged that "radical Hindu groups" in [[Orissa, India]] have forced Christian converts from Hinduism to "revert"&lt;ref name="revert"&gt;the word ''revert'' is used in this context; not ''convert''; see [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4413900 Older than the Church: Christianity and Caste in The God of Small Things India] by A Sekhar;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/mar/11/proselytism-on-the-table Washington post article]&lt;/ref&gt; to Hinduism. These "religious riots" were largely between two tribal groups in [[Orissa, India|Orissa]], one of which was predominantly Hindu and another predominantly Christian, over the [[Murder of Swami Lakshmanananda|assassination]] of a Hindu leader named [[Swami Lakshmanananda]] by [[Maoists]] operating as terrorist groups in India (see [[Naxalite]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindujagruti.org/news/5576.html |title=We killed Swami Laxmananda: Christian Maoist leader – Attack |publisher=hindujagruti.org |date=2008-10-06 |accessdate=2012-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath of the violence, American Christian evangelical groups have claimed that Hindu groups are "forcibly reverting" Christians converts from Hinduism back to Hinduism.&lt;ref name="revert" /&gt; It has also been alleged that groups have converted poor Muslims and Christians to Hinduism against their will and through allurements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-30429118|title=Indian Agra Muslim fear conversions to Hinduism|work=BBC News|accessdate=May 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/news/2014/12/30/cardinal-protests-against-forced-conversion-of-christians-to-hinduism/|title=CatholicHerald.co.uk » Cardinal protests against forced conversions to Hinduism|publisher=|accessdate=May 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly Hindus claim that Christian missionaries used money and free education to lure Hindus for conversion.

Christopher Marsh, a professor at the [[Baylor University]] writes that "Tracing the social nature of religion from Schleiermacher and Feurbach to Marx, Engles, and Lenin...the idea of religion as a social product evolved to the point of policies aimed at the forced conversion of believers to atheism."&lt;ref name="Marsh2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Marsh|first=Christopher|title=Religion and the State in Russia and China: Suppression, Survival, and Revival|date=20 January 2011|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|language=English|isbn=978-1-4411-0284-3|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Jonathan Blake of the Department of Political Science at [[Columbia University]] elucidates the history of this practice in the USSR, stating that:&lt;ref name="Blake2014" /&gt;

{{quote|God, however, did not simply vanish after the Bolshevik revolution. Soviet authorities relied heavily on coercion to spread their idea of scientific atheism. This included confiscating church goods and property, forcibly closing religious institutions and executing religious leaders and believers or sending them to the [[gulag]]. … Later, the United States passed the Jackson-Vanik amendment which harmed US-Soviet trade relations until the USSR permitted the emigration of religious minorities, primarily Jews.

Across [[Eastern Europe]] following [[World War II]], the parts of the [[Nazi Empire]] conquered by the Soviet [[Red Army]], and Yugsolavia became one party Communist states and the project of coercive conversion continued.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hebblethwaite; Paul VI, the First Modern Pope; Harper Collins Religious; 1993; p.211&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norman Davies; Rising '44: the Battle for Warsaw; Vikiing; 2003; p.566 &amp; 568&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Union ended its war time truce against the Russian Orthodox Church, and extended its persecutions to the newly Communist Eastern bloc: "In [[Polish anti-religious campaign|Poland]], Hungary, Lithuania and other Eastern European countries, Catholic leaders who were unwilling to be silent were denounced, publicly humiliated or imprisoned by the Communists. Leaders of the national Orthodox Churches in [[Religious persecution in Communist Romania|Romania]] and Bulgaria had to be cautious and submissive", wrote Blainey.&lt;ref name="Viking p.494"/&gt; While the churches were generally not as severely treated as they had been in the USSR, nearly all their schools and many of their churches were closed, and they lost their formally prominent roles in public life.

The latest estimates indicate that thousands of individuals were executed for religious crimes and hundreds of thousands of religious believers were imprisoned in labor camps or psychiatric hospitals.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, historian Emily Baran writes that "some accounts suggest the conversion to militant atheism did not always end individuals' existential questions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baran|first=Emily|year=2011|title="I saw the light": Former Protestant believer testimonials in the Soviet Union, 1957-1987 |journal=Cahiers Du Monde Russe |volume=52|issue=1|pages=163–184 |url=http://monderusse.revues.org/9325 |quote=Atheist agitators hoped that such stories would help to convince believers and non-believers alike that the search for purpose in life could be solved with the discovery of atheism and communism. Yet some accounts suggest the conversion to militant atheism did not always end individuals' existential questions. To begin with, many former believers joined and left several religious organizations prior to renouncing faith altogether. Their life history could not be simply divided into two halves. One man recounted having joined the Baptists, Pentecostals, and the Seventh-Day Adventists before abandoning religion. Another man had been an Old Believer, Baptist, Pentecostal, and Witness. In other words, many believers had spent time as non-believers, but found life without religious faith somehow unsatisfying. As a result, some former believers admitted to having previously left religious organizations, only to return to them later. Many of them noted how after publicly denouncing Protestantism, they continued to receive visits from their former religious leaders asking them to reconsider. Indeed, atheist propaganda sometimes included complaints that once a believer had been convinced to leave his faith, atheist agitators lost interest in him, viewing the case as resolved.&lt;!--|language=English--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== French Revolution ===
During the [[French Revolution]], a [[Dechristianisation of France during the French Revolution|campaign of dechristianization]] happened which included removal and destruction of religious objects from places of worship; English librarian [[Thomas Hartwell Horne]] and biblical scholar [[Samuel Davidson]] write that "churches were converted into 'temples of reason,' in which atheistical and licesntious homilies were substituted for the proscribed service".&lt;ref name="HorneDavidson2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Horne|first1=Thomas Hartwell|last2=Davidson|first2=Samuel|title=An Introduction to the Critical Study and Knowledge of the Holy Scriptures|date=21 November 2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|language=English |isbn=978-1-108-06772-0|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Latreille, A.

===East Asian Communism===
The emergence of Communist states across [[East Asia]] after World War Two saw religion purged by atheist regimes across [[China]], [[North Korea]] and much of [[Indochina|Indo-China]].&lt;ref name="Geoffrey Blainey p.508"&gt;Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Viking; 2011; p.508&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, China became a Communist state under the leadership of [[Mao Zedong]]'s [[Communist Party of China]]. China itself had been a cradle of religious thought since ancient times, being the birthplace of [[Confucianism]] and [[Daoism]], and Buddhists having arrived in the first century AD. Under Mao, China became officially atheist, and though some religious practices were permitted to continue under State supervision, religious groups deemed a threat to order have been suppressed—as with [[Tibetan Buddhism]] from 1959 and [[Falun Gong]] in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/111803/China/258959/Altaic#toc258961 Encyclopædia Britannica Online - China: Religion]; accessed 10 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Religious schools and social institutions were closed, foreign missionaries expelled, and local religious practices discouraged.&lt;ref name="Geoffrey Blainey p.508"/&gt; During the [[Cultural Revolution]], Mao instigated "struggles" against the Four Olds: "old ideas, customs, culture, and habits of mind".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/111803/China/71854/Attacks-on-party-members Encyclopædia Britannica Online - China - History: Cultural Revolution]; accessed 10 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, the Communist Party launched a three-year drive to promote atheism in Tibet, saying intensifying propaganda on atheism is "especially important for Tibet because atheism plays an extremely important role in promoting economic construction, social advancement and socialist spiritual civilization in the region".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/monitoring/253345.stm China announces "civilizing" atheism drive in Tibet]; BBC; January 12, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

A truce was negotiated with the assistance of U.S. Ambassador [[Dwight Whitney Morrow]].&lt;ref name="Blood-Drenched Altars"&gt;{{cite |last=Van Hove |first=Brian |date=1996 |title=Blood-Drenched Altars: Baltimore's Archbishop Michael Joseph Curley, Oklahoma's Bishop Francis Clement Kelley and the Mexican Affair: 1934-1936 |publisher=[[Eternal Word Television Network]] |url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/HOMELIBR/FR94204.TXT |access-date=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calles, however, did not abide by the terms of the truce – in violation of its terms, he had approximately 500 Cristero leaders and 5,000 other Cristeros shot, frequently in their homes in front of their spouses and children.&lt;ref name="Blood-Drenched Altars" /&gt; Particularly offensive to Catholics after the supposed truce was Calles' insistence on a complete state monopoly on education, suppressing all Catholic education and introducing "socialist" education in its place: "We must enter and take possession of the mind of childhood, the mind of youth.".&lt;ref name="Blood-Drenched Altars"/&gt; The persecution continued as Calles maintained control under his [[Maximato]] and did not relent until 1940, when President [[Manuel Ávila Camacho]], a believing Catholic, took office.&lt;ref name="Blood-Drenched Altars" /&gt; This attempt to indoctrinate the youth in atheism was begun in 1934 by amending Article 3 to the [[Mexican Constitution]] to eradicate religion by mandating "socialist education", which "in addition to removing all religious doctrine" would "combat fanaticism and prejudices", "build[ing] in the youth a rational and exact concept of the universe and of social life".&lt;ref name="lawreview.byu.edu" /&gt; In 1946 this "socialist education" was removed from the constitution and the document returned to the less egregious generalized secular education.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2515">'''Fraternal correction''' (''correctio fraterna'') is the admonishing of one's neighbor by a private individual with the purpose of reforming him or, if possible, preventing his sinful indulgence.

This is distinct from an official disciplining, whose mouthpiece is a judge or other like superior, whose object is the punishment of one found to be guilty, and whose motive is not so directly the individual advantage of the offender as the furtherance of the common good.

In [[Roman Catholic]] ethics, this is, upon occasion and with due regard to circumstances, an obligation.  This is a conclusion not only deducible from the [[natural law]] binding us to love and to assist one another, but also explicitly contained in positive precept: "If thy brother shall offend against thee, go, and rebuke him between thee and him alone. If he shall hear thee, thou shalt gain thy brother" (Matthew 18:15). Given a sufficiently grave condition of spiritual distress calling for succour in this way, this commandment may exact fulfilment under pain of [[mortal sin]].

The obligation of fraternal correction, so far as private persons go, does not obtain, generally speaking, for the case of one who violates a law through [[Invincible ignorance (Catholic theology)|invincible ignorance]].

Normally, the duty calls for the reproof to be administered privately. This is plainly the method appointed by Christ in the words just cited and only as a remedy for obduracy is any other contemplated by Him. Still there are occasions upon which one might lawfully proceed in a different way. For instance

* when the offence is a public one;
* when it makes for the prejudice of a third party or perhaps even the entire community;
* when it can only be condignly dealt with by the authority of a superior paternally exercised;
* when a public rebuke is necessary to preclude [[Scandal (theology)|scandal]]
* when the offender has already in advance relinquished whatever right he possessed to have his good name safeguarded, as is the custom in some religious bodies.

'''Frederik van Leenhof''' (1 September 1647 – 13 October 1715)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.biografischportaal.nl/persoon/07672882 |title=Frederik van Leenhof |work=Biografisch portaal van Nederland |publisher=[[Huygens Institute for the History of the Netherlands]] |accessdate=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|Joris van Eijnatten &amp; Fred van Lieburg}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=noOPgJYg18QC ''Nederlandse Religiegeschiedenis''] (2006), p. 214. Second Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] [[pastor]] and [[philosopher]] active in [[Zwolle]], who caused an international controversy because of his [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinozist]] work ''Heaven on Earth'' (1703). This controversy is extensively discussed in [[Jonathan Israel]]'s 2001 book ''Radical Enlightenment''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Israel |first=Jonathan |authorlink=Jonathan Israel |date=2001 |chapter=Leenhof and the 'Universal Philosophical Religion' |title=Radical Enlightenment.

== Education and career ==
Leenhof studied [[theology]] in the 1660s at [[Utrecht University]] under [[Gisbertus Voetius|Voetius]], and at [[Leiden University]] under [[Johannes Cocceius|Cocceius]] during the Voetian–Cocceian dispute. He served as pastor in [[Abbeville]] (1670–71), [[Nieuwvliet]] (1672–78) and [[Velsen]] (1680–81), before finally settling in [[Zwolle]] in 1681.&lt;ref name=KB&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://poortman.kb.nl/long2.php?TABEL=T_NAAM&amp;ID=12741 |title=Biographical data Frederik van Leenhof |work=Poortmans repertorium |publisher=[[National Library of the Netherlands]] |accessdate=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his first period of writing from 1673 until 1684, he fervently chose the side of the Cartesio-Cocceians against Voetian fundamentalism. He accused his opponents of [[smear tactics]] and [[straw man|straw men]], denying the claim 'that out of Descartes' school come [[atheism|atheists]] and libertines'. However, a letter correspondence with [[Christopher Wittich]] (briefly his host in [[Leiden]] shortly before 1681), in which Leenhof defended [[Baruch Spinoza]]'s views on substance and creation, was published after Wittich's death in 1687 without Leenhof's permission under the name ''Anti-Spinoza''. When pressed, he admitted having written them, so by 1681 Leenhof must have already been familiar with Spinoza's thought, and accepted important core concepts of it. His 1684 work ''Keten der Bybelsche Godgeleerdheit'' ("Chain of Biblical Theology") was later found to contain typically Spinozist views.&lt;ref&gt;Israel, 406–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his correspondence with Wittich, Leenhof argues that the universe must always have existed; a [[creation ex nihilo|creation ''ex nihilo'']] would violate God's perfect nature. Also, a pure spirit could not logically create substance, therefore God must be one with or present in the physical world, claimed Leenhof, rejecting [[Dualistic cosmology#In Christianity|dualism]].&lt;ref&gt;Israel, 407–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst studying his religion and exploring modern ethics during his second period of writing (1700–04), Leenhof came into contact with the early [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], which originated in the [[Dutch Republic]] around 1650. Amongst other things, he tried to formulate a [[Stoicism|Stoic]] and [[Epicureanism|Epicurean]] system of ethics, with no role for [[Salvation (Christianity)|Christian salvation]], in his 1700 work ''Prediker'' ("Preacher").&lt;ref name=KB/&gt; Politically, it advocates the rejection of [[monarchy]] ("without doubt the most imperfect [rule]") and [[aristocracy]], and argues for a [[republic|republican form of government]] instead. Hereditary succession is worthless; only [[reason]] provides legitimacy, and true sovereignty is the common good of the community. Royal [[standing armies]] of [[mercenaries]] are to be abolished, lest they be used to oppress the king's subjects; instead, the state should train its citizens and form a militia to be able to defend the common good. Leenhof also opined that [[Moral universalism|morals are universal]], and knowable through the use of reason.&lt;ref&gt;Israel, 408–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Leenhof controversy ==
In agreement with [[Baruch Spinoza]] (1632–77), Leenhof eventually came to reject belief in a [[personal god]], which was considered [[heresy]] in contemporary [[Christendom]]. Leenhof's book ''Heaven on Earth'', published simultaneously in Zwolle and [[Amsterdam]] in June 1703, is written completely in Spinozist ([[pantheism|pantheist]]) thought, although he always denied being an adherent of the then hugely controversial Spinoza. In fact, the book did not 'refer explicitly to any forbidden philosopher or doctrine', but the unorthodox way in which he presented his ideas, one after the other, almost devoid of any Christian context, caused uproar amongst his readers.&lt;ref&gt;Israel, 410.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contents of ''Heaven on Earth'' ===

}}
Leenhof opined that every human being could realise [[heaven]] on Earth, by judgeing the world according to "God's order" (=nature), expressed in the [[laws of science|laws of nature]], and by reading [[the gospel]].&lt;ref name="Jansen"&gt;{{aut|Harry Jansen}}, ''Triptiek van de Tijd'' (2010), p. 244–245.&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed on linguistic grounds that what [[Bible|Scripture]] means by 'heaven' and 'hell' are not places or locations, but states of mind. The former is attained when one acquires knowledge of God, which results in a state of stable, enduring happiness. 'Hell' is the feeling when a person does not have adequate knowledge of God, and is therefore unhappy; it is not a physical, divine punishment for [[sin]], but mental suffering that they should try to avoid.&lt;ref name="Israel411"&gt;Israel, 411.&lt;/ref&gt; The eradication of false ideas and [[superstition]]s, such as belief in [[witch]]es, [[spirit]]s and [[ghost]]s, is a precondition for peace of mind and joy. To achieve this, authorities need to implement a policy of [[freedom of thought]], [[toleration]] of other people's (non)religious and philosophical views, and the [[freedom of speech|freedom to express and discuss]] those opinions without taboo, which will allow the common people to emancipate and enlighten themselves from their ignorance.&lt;ref&gt;Israel, 412.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Heaven on Earth'' attacked and defended ===
His book was hotly debated by the Zwolle government and the [[States of Overijssel]] for quite some time, whilst both Voetians and Cocceians demanded Leenhof to retract it, because it did not refer to God as the saviour, to the Christian faith or [[revelation]]. Writings suggest the controversial book was a hot topic amongst common people, remarking that only few had not heard about it. Although a handful of laymen warmly welcomed it, the entire theological, ecclesiastical and political establishment condemned it, and not one of his former Cocceian colleagues defended him. However, an unknown Spinozist by the mysterious pseudonym of "E. D. M." wrote a scathing critique of Leenhof's detractors, titled ''Redenkundige Aanmerkingen'' ("Rhetorical Remarks"). It alleges many of the attacks on Leenhof's work are nothing more than attempts to compare it to anything Spinoza wrote and condemn it for that reason, whilst showing even declared anti-Spinozists have adopted some of his ideas. Leenhof's greatest critic, Taco Hajo van den Honert, accused both him and his publisher Barend Hakvoord (also [[precentor]] at St. Michael's Church in Zwolle&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/bie_005biog03_01/bie_005biog03_01_0359.php |title=Barend Hakvoord |author=Jan Pieter de Bie &amp; Jacob Loosjes |work=Biographisch woordenboek van protestantsche godgeleerden in Nederland. Deel 3 |publisher=DBNL |date=1931 |accessdate=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) of having written it, which they denied. During the ongoing controversy about his book, Leenhof often defended himself in writing against numerous accusations concerning his book (the most notable being ''Hemel op Aarde Opgehelderd'', "Heaven on Earth Clarified", or simply ''Opheldering'' or "Clarification").&lt;ref&gt;Israel, 412–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Secular versus religious authorities ===
[[File:Leenhof 1703.gif|thumb|''Heaven on Earth'' (1703), that stirred up religious debate across Europe.]]
On 20 March 1704, Leenhof took the initiative to convene the Zwolle church council to ask his colleagues' support, and declared that nothing he had written contradicted the teachings of the dominant [[Dutch Reformed Church]], the [[Belgic Confession|''Confessio Belgica'']], which he acknowledged were the true path to Salvation, and formally declared that 'I reject whatever is harmful, directly or indirectly, to our teaching in the writings of Spinoza or others'. The consistory backed Leenhof, but the regional classis did not and called for his suspension. Here the [[burgomaster]]s of Zwolle intervened that nobody from outside the city could decide who could or could not preach what without even having consulted the magistrate, resulting in a great conflict between secular and religious authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Israel, 414–15.&lt;/ref&gt; In May, it reached the provincial level, with Synod of Overijssel claiming ''Heaven on Earth'' was full of the "soul-destroying ideas in the writings of the damned atheist Spinoza" that the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]] had previously forbidden because of their "godlessness", whilst the [[States of Overijssel]] stood by the burgomasters of Zwolle. Next, the controversy spread to [[Lordship of Frisia|Frisia]], [[Guelders]] (in August) and especially [[County of Holland|Holland]], whose synods all condemned Leenhof's work as basically a refurbishment of Spinoza. Then [[Anthonie Heinsius]], Grand Pensionary of Holland (the ''de facto'' head of state of the Dutch Republic during the [[Second Stadtholderless Period]]), called for a ban on ''Heaven on Earth'' and Leenhof's later defences, arguing the denial of the true religion would also undermine the State.&lt;ref&gt;Israel, 416.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Articles of Satisfaction'' ===
Meanwhile, the Zwolle consistory drafted, with Leenhof's help, the ten Articles of Satisfaction, published in August 1704, clarifying that his thought differed from Spinozism, that is to be utterly condemned for its incongruity with Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Israel, 417.&lt;/ref&gt; The Articles were ratified unanimously by the consistory and government of Zwolle, and proclaimed from the pulpits of the city's largest three churches on the first Sunday of November.&lt;ref&gt;Israel, 419.&lt;/ref&gt; Again, this failed to placate his critics. The States and Synods outside of Overijssel continued to pressure Zwolle to condemn and ban Leenhof's 'Spinozistic' last three books, which the States of Holland imposed in their own province on 18 December 1706. During a meeting of the States General on 29 December 1706, the other provinces urged Overijssel to impose a similar ban on the books, but the delegates of Overijssel responded that 'this would only provide further encouragement to read them', and stressed their province's autonomy in the matter.&lt;ref&gt;Israel, 424.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1708, the Synod of Overijssel called for Leenhof to be fired and excommunicated from the Reformed Church, lest his views led his congregation and others astray, and discussed tighter controls against 'licentious books' in general.&lt;ref&gt;Israel, 427.&lt;/ref&gt; The call of censorship of radical writings was echoed by religious and sometimes secular authorities in other provinces as well, although the [[regenten]] feared this would strengthen the Church's power at their disadvantage. Sanctions against Zwolle were imposed by several provincial synods in 1708, including that of North Holland and Guelders that no preacher from Zwolle could participate in any church gathering in their regions. Finally, the deadlock in the States of Overijssel was resolved in March 1709, when the majority ruled against the wish of Zwolle that Leenhof had to sign additional Articles of Satisfaction drafted by the synod to utterly repudiate Spinozism. At a synod and States' commissioners' meeting in Deventer in June 1709, Leenhof defiantly denied having ever taught Spinozism, but only orthodoxy, and that he could not retract more than he had already done, and not recant his last three books. After this, Leenhof's books were banned in Overijssel, but the Zwolle magistrate refused to strip him from his pastoral position.&lt;ref&gt;Israel, 428–29.&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1710, they finally requested him to resign, which Leenhof did. However, he remained a popular figure within Zwolle, receiving both salary and [[sacrament]]s and retaining his preacher's seat in church. His still favoured position led to continued debates and harsh words around the country against the consistory and magistrate of Zwolle. Eventually, a majority in the consistory of Zwolle voted to excommunicate Leenhof in 1712.&lt;ref&gt;Israel, 430.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Outside of the Netherlands ===
Although discharged honourably from his pastoral position in 1710, and excommunicated disgracefully in 1712, Leenhof's ideas spread far and wide. ''Heaven on Earth'' was translated in many languages and spread all across Europe, via [[Holy Roman Empire|Germany]] along the [[Baltic Sea]] cities into the [[Baltic states]], [[History of Italy (1559–1814)|Italy]], [[Enlightenment in Spain|Spain]] and [[History of Portugal (1640–1777)|Portugal]].&lt;ref name="Jansen"/&gt;

'''José Sigfredo Landaverde''' (born September 2, 1971) is a [[community organizer]], [[activist]], and [[priest#Anglican or Episcopalian|priest]] at Our Lady of Guadalupe [[Anglican Catholic Church]], located in the largely Mexican neighborhood of [[Little Village, Chicago|Little Village]] in [[South Side Chicago]].  He is a former executive director of the Latino Union.&lt;ref&gt;[http://12.43.67.2/legislation/fulltext.asp?DocName=&amp;SessionId=3&amp;GA=93&amp;DocTypeId=HR&amp;DocNum=599&amp;GAID=3&amp;LegID=7808&amp;SpecSess=&amp;Session= HR 599], [[Illinois General Assembly]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Landaverde was born into a poor family in [[La Reina, Chalatenango|La Reina]], [[Chalatenango Department|Chalatenango]], [[El Salvador]].   He was forced into the jungle to join [[Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front]] guerrilla.  At 17, he was arrested by the military and severely beaten for organizing among the poor.  He fled to [[Guatemala]], [[Mexico]], and ultimately, the [[United States]], where he was given status as a [[political refugee]].

Upon seeing what he perceived as injustices perpetuated against [[Latinos]] in the United States, particularly [[illegal immigration|illegal immigrants]], [[day labor]]ers, and those working in [[temporary work|temporary agencies]], he began working with grassroots organizations to reach out to the exploited community.  His leadership led him to co-found the Latino Union in May 2000 in Chicago, Illinois.

==Education==
Influenced by the role of his mother as a [[catechist]], and inspired by the martyrdom of [[Óscar Romero|Archbishop Óscar Arnulfo Romero]], Landaverde studied at [[Catholic Theological Union]], and later in [[Garrett-Evangelical Theological Seminary]], obtaining his [[Master's degree|master's]] in [[Divinity]].

==Pastorship==
As he was obtaining his master's, the [[Northern Illinois Conference (United Methodist)|Northern Illinois Conference of the United Methodist Church]] appointed him as a [[pastor]] in Amor De Dios United Methodist Church in July 2003.  One of Landaverde’s main goals was to promote [[ecumenicism]] by merging the gap between the [[Roman Catholicism]] of [[Little Village, Chicago|Little Village]] and [[Protestantism]], inspired by the example of [[John Wesley]], the founder of United Methodism.

One of his controversial strategies was introducing an icon of the [[Virgin of Guadalupe]], a national symbol of patriotism and faith in Mexico.  Within the Methodist Church there was support, but also opposition that sparked headlines in newspapers and magazines such as [[Time (magazine)|Time]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1037624-1,00.html Hail, Mary], [[Time (magazine)|Time]], David van Biema, Mar. 13, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thinking of Mary as the first [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciple]] of [[Jesus]] and keeping in mind Wesley’s view of her as a "pure and unspotted virgin",&lt;ref&gt;[http://wesley.nnu.edu/john_wesley/letters/1749b.htm "Letter to a Roman Catholic" (DUBLIN July 18, 1749)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903061336/http://wesley.nnu.edu/john_wesley/letters/1749b.htm |date=September 3, 2006 }}   {{cite web|url=http://ic.net/~erasmus/RAZ81.HTM |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080201042003/http://ic.net/~erasmus/RAZ81.HTM |archivedate=2008-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Landaverde ignored the cries of [[conservative]] Methodists.  The practice was eventually approved by Superintendent Donald F. Guest, but was still frowned upon by many.

Amor De Dios United Methodist Church at the time of his ministry continued financially unstable, at times encouraging Landaverde to donate his paycheck to the church treasury.  He expressed discontent toward the Conference, feeling that it left poor churches even more economically vulnerable.  His frustration peaked at the criticism displayed by conservative Methodists who insisted that his [[theology]] was too "[[Political radicalism|radical]]," or, conversely, Roman Catholic.  The lack of support and resources from the Church inhibited many of his [[grassroots]] projects.  Finally, in 2006 he retired from his position in the Methodist Church, leaving a trusted [[laity|lay member]], Ramiro Rodríguez, in charge.

==Priesthood==
Landaverde transferred to the Anglican Catholic Church that same year.  In the summer of 2007, he opened up a closed bar in [[Little Village, Chicago|Little Village]] and remodeled it to become a Spanish-speaking Anglican Catholic mission in Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.chicagoreporter.com/pastor-immigrant-rights-activist-step-down-church/|title=Pastor, immigrant-rights activist to step down from church|last=Zamudio|first=Maria Ines|date=April 21, 2014|work=The Chicago Reporter|access-date=September 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Landaverde is known for his grassroots organizing, particularly concerning immigrants' and workers' rights,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130502235047/http://www.blythe.org/nytransfer-subs/2001rac/People's_Tribune_(09-01)_Online_Edition People's Tribune], September 2001&lt;/ref&gt; being the first to popularize the new sanctuary movement in Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laraza.com/print.php?nid=30382&amp;origen=1] El Santuario De Los Inmigrantes&lt;/ref&gt;  He housed immigrants in danger of deportation, most notably [[Elvira Arellano]] in 2004, before she took refuge in Adalberto United Methodist church in Humboldt Park in August 2006. He worked with the day laborers of Home Depot&lt;ref&gt;[http://mesh.medill.northwestern.edu/mnschicago/archives/2003/05/chiday2.html]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Northwestern Medill News Service&lt;/ref&gt; and sent truckloads of provisions to [[New Orleans]] in 2005&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20070815150446/http://gbgmchurches.gbgm-umc.org/NILLCONF/repsep05.htm#91606], [[Northern Illinois Conference (United Methodist)]]&lt;/ref&gt; and donated toys and supplies to [[Tabasco]], México in Christmas of 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hoyinternet.com/noticias/localidades/chicago/hoy-pp4juguetesjan14,0,2251698.story?coll=hoy-chicago-heds-top  Salen Juguetes Hacia Tabasco], [http://www.hoyinternet.com/ Hoy]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
In December 2014 Landaverde was arrested and accused of beating a woman in his apartment in Little Village after a night of drinking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/chi-retired-activist-priest-accused-of-beating-woman-20141210-story.html], Chicago Tribune, December 11, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{nihongo|'''kagura-den''' |神楽殿|lit. kagura palace}}, also called {{nihongo|''maidono''|舞殿|dance palace}} or {{nihongo|''buden''|舞殿}} with reference to the [[bugaku]] traditional dance, is the building within a [[Shinto shrine]] where the sacred dance (''[[kagura]]'') and music are offered to the ''[[kami]]'' during ceremonies.&lt;ref name="ja"&gt;[http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/m/maidono.htm Maidono], [[JAANUS]], accessed on July 12, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
It was originally just a temporary stage, first mentioned in a 9th-century text describing a ''maidono'' built in front of [[Hirano Shrine]]. In about a century it had become a permanent shrine feature, and its use was extended until its function as a worship hall prevailed over the original.&lt;ref name="ja"/&gt; It is now used also for weddings and [[Noh]] plays. Some scholars believe the ''[[Heiden (Shinto)|heiden]]'', or hall of worship, has its origins in the ''kagura-den''.

A [[Chinese legend|semi-legendary]] figure, Laozi was usually portrayed as a 6th-century&amp;nbsp;BC contemporary of [[Confucius]], but some modern historians consider him to have lived during the [[Warring States period]] of the 4th&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name=Kohn4&gt;{{Harvtxt|Kohn|2000|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; A central figure in [[Chinese culture]], Laozi is claimed by both the emperors of the [[Tang dynasty]] and modern people of the [[Li (surname 李)|Li surname]] as a founder of their lineage. Laozi's work has been embraced by both various [[Anti-authoritarianism|anti-authoritarian]] movements&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ztopics.com/Lao-tse/ |title=Lao-tse |work=ztopics.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Chinese Legalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Han Fei Tzu, the paradigm legalist, wrote one of the earliest commentaries on the Lao Tzu (cf. [http://www.philosophy.hku.hk/courses/zhuangzi/shendao.htm University of Hong Kong] page).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Names==
In traditional accounts, Laozi's [[Chinese personal names|personal name]] is usually given as ''Li&amp;nbsp;Er'' {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|李|耳}}}},}} &lt;small&gt;[[Old Chinese|Old]]&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[reconstruction of Old Chinese|*]]''rə[[glottal stop|ʔ]]&amp;nbsp;nə[[glottal stop|ʔ]]'',&lt;ref name=baxsag&gt;{{cite web |last1=Baxter |first1=William |first2=Laurent |last2=Sagart |url=http://ocbaxtersagart.lsait.lsa.umich.edu/BaxterSagartOCbyMandarinMC2014-09-20.pdf |title=Baxter–Sagart Old Chinese Reconstruction |date=2014-09-20 |accessdate=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;small&gt;[[pinyin|Mod.]]&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;''Lǐ&amp;nbsp;Ěr'') and his [[courtesy name]] as ''Boyang'' {{nowrap|(&lt;small&gt;[[traditional characters|trad.]]&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;{{lang|zh|{{linktext|伯|陽}}}},}} {{nowrap|&lt;small&gt;[[simplified characters|simp.]]&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;{{lang|zh|{{linktext|伯|阳}}}},}} &lt;small&gt;[[Old Chinese|Old]]&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[reconstruction of Old Chinese|*]]''P[[Pharyngealization|ˤrak]]-lang'',&lt;ref name=baxsag/&gt; &lt;small&gt;[[pinyin|Mod.]]&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;''Bóyáng'').

==Historical views==
[[File:Laozi.jpg|thumb|left|upright|According to [[Chinese legend]], Laozi left [[Zhou Empire|China]] for the west on a [[Domestic Asian Water Buffalo|water buffalo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Renard|2002|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In the mid-twentieth century, a consensus emerged among scholars that the [[historicity]] of the person known as Laozi is doubtful and that the ''Tao Te Ching'' was "a compilation of Taoist sayings by many hands".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Watson|1968|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alan Watts]] urged more caution, holding that this view was part of an academic fashion for skepticism about historical spiritual and religious figures and stating that not enough would be known for years – or possibly ever – to make a firm judgment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Watts|1975|p=xxiii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest certain reference to the present figure of Laozi is found in the 1st&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;BC ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' collected by the historian [[Sima Qian]] from earlier accounts. In one account, Laozi was said to be a contemporary of [[Confucius]] during the 6th or 5th&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;BC. His [[Chinese surname|surname]] was [[Li (surname 李)|Li]] and his personal name was Er or Dan. He was an official in the imperial archives and wrote a book in two parts before departing to the west. In another, Laozi was a different contemporary of [[Confucius]] titled Lao Laizi {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|老|莱|子}}}})}} and wrote a book in 15 parts. In a third, he was the court astrologer Lao Dan who lived during the 4th century&amp;nbsp;BC reign of [[list of dukes of Qin|Duke]] [[Duke Xian of Qin (424–362 BC)|Xian]] of the [[state of Qin|Qin Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Fowler|2005|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Robinet|1997|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest text of the ''Tao Te Ching'' so far recovered was written on [[bamboo slips]] and dates to the late 4th&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;BC;&lt;ref name="stanford"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/laozi/|title=Laozi|publisher=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] by [[Stanford University]]|quote=The discovery of two ''Laozi'' silk manuscripts at Mawangdui, near Changsha, Hunan province in 1973 marks an important milestone in modern ''Laozi'' research. The manuscripts, identified simply as "A" (jia) and "B" (yi), were found in a tomb that was sealed in 168 BC. The texts themselves can be dated earlier, the "A" manuscript being the older of the two, copied in all likelihood before 195 BC.&lt;p&gt;Until recently, the Mawangdui manuscripts have held the pride of place as the oldest extant manuscripts of the ''Laozi''. In late 1993, the excavation of a tomb (identified as M1) in [[Guodian, Jingmen|Guodian]], [[Jingmen]] city, [[Hubei province]], has yielded among other things some 800 bamboo slips, of which 730 are inscribed, containing over 13,000 Chinese characters. Some of these, amounting to about 2,000 characters, match the ''Laozi''. The tomb...is dated around 300 BC.&lt;/p&gt;|year=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; see [[Guodian Chu Slips]].

According to traditional accounts, Laozi was a scholar who worked as the Keeper of the Archives for the royal court of [[Zhou Dynasty|Zhou]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edepot.com/taoism_lao-tzu.html |title=Lao Tzu (Lao Zi) Scroll Paintings and Posters |publisher=Edepot.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reportedly allowed him broad access to the works of the [[Yellow Emperor]] and other classics of the time. The stories assert that Laozi never opened a formal school but nonetheless attracted a large number of students and loyal disciples. There are many variations of a story retelling his encounter with Confucius, most famously in the ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]''.&lt;ref name="Simpkins 1999 pp 12-13"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Simpkins|Simpkins|1999|pp=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Morgan|2001|pp=223–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was sometimes held to have come from the [[village (China)|village]] of [[Chu Jen]] in [[state of Chu|Chu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Morgan|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In accounts where Laozi married, he was said to have had a son named Zong who became a celebrated soldier.

The story tells of Zong the Warrior who defeats the enemy and triumphs, and then abandons the corpses of the enemy soldiers to be eaten by vultures. By coincidence Laozi, traveling and teaching the way of the Tao, comes on the scene and is revealed to be the father of Zong,  from whom he was separated in childhood. Laozi tells his son that it is better to treat respectfully a beaten enemy, and that the disrespect to their dead would cause his foes to seek revenge. Convinced, Zong orders his soldiers to bury the enemy dead. Funeral mourning is held for the dead of both parties and a lasting peace is made.

Many clans of the Li family trace their descent to Laozi,&lt;ref name="Woolf2007 1"&gt;{{cite book|author= Woolf, Greg|title=Ancient civilizations: the illustrated guide to belief, mythology, and art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=94NuSg3tlsgC&amp;q=Li+Er+Laozi|year=2007|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble|isbn=978-1435101210|pages=218–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the [[List of rulers of China|emperors]] of the [[Tang dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |accessdate=February 8, 2012|title=The Chinese: their history and culture, Volume 1|author=Latourette, Kenneth Scott|quote=T'ai Tsung's family professed descent from Lao Tzu (for the latter's reputed patronymic was likewise Li)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ultxAAAAMAAJ|edition=2|volume=|series= |year=1934|location= |publisher=Macmillan|language=|isbn=|page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Woolf2007 1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hargett2006"&gt;{{cite book|author= Hargett, James M.|title=Stairway to Heaven: A Journey to the Summit of Mount Emei|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m21KGsV8ihgC&amp;pg=PA54#v=onepage|year=2006|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0791466827|pages=54–}}&lt;/ref&gt; This family was known as the Longxi Li lineage ([[w:zh:隴西李氏|隴西李氏]]). According to the Simpkinses, while many (if not all) of these lineages are questionable, they provide a testament to Laozi's impact on Chinese culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Simpkins|Simpkins|1999|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Laozi meets Yin Xi.PNG|thumb|left|Laozi meets [[Yinxi]]]]
[[File:Konfuzius-laozi.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Confucius]] meets Laozi'', Shih Kang, [[Yuan dynasty]]]]

The third story in [[Sima Qian]] states that Laozi grew weary of the moral decay of life in [[Chengzhou]] and noted the kingdom's decline. He ventured west to live as a hermit in the unsettled frontier at the age of 80. At the western gate of the city (or kingdom), he was recognized by the guard [[Yinxi]]. The sentry asked the old master to record his wisdom for the good of the country before he would be permitted to pass. The text Laozi wrote was said to be the ''Tao Te Ching'', although the present version of the text includes additions from later periods. In some versions of the tale, the sentry was so touched by the work that he became a disciple and left with Laozi, never to be seen again.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Kohn|Lafargue|1998|pp=14, 17, 54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; In others, the "Old Master" journeyed all the way to India and was the teacher of [[Siddartha Gautama]], the [[Buddha]]. Others say he was the Buddha himself.&lt;ref name="Simpkins 1999 pp 12-13"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Morgan|2001|pp=224–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lao Tzu - Project Gutenberg eText 15250.jpg|thumb|Depiction of Laozi in [[E. T. C. Werner]]'s ''Myths and Legends of China'']]
A seventh-century work, the ''Sandong Zhunang'' ("Pearly Bag of the Three Caverns"), embellished the relationship between Laozi and Yinxi. Laozi pretended to be a farmer when reaching the western gate, but was recognized by [[Yinxi]], who asked to be taught by the great master. Laozi was not satisfied by simply being noticed by the guard and demanded an explanation. Yinxi expressed his deep desire to find the ''Tao'' and explained that his long study of astrology allowed him to recognize Laozi's approach. Yinxi was accepted by Laozi as a disciple. This is considered an exemplary interaction between Taoist master and disciple, reflecting the testing a seeker must undergo before being accepted. A would-be adherent is expected to prove his determination and talent, clearly expressing his wishes and showing that he had made progress on his own towards realizing the ''Tao''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Kohn|Lafargue|1998|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Pearly Bag of the Three Caverns'' continues the parallel of an adherent's quest. Yinxi received his ordination when Laozi transmitted the ''Tao Te Ching'', along with other texts and precepts, just as Taoist adherents receive a number of methods, teachings and scriptures at ordination. This is only an initial ordination and Yinxi still needed an additional period to perfect his virtue, thus Laozi gave him three years to perfect his Tao. Yinxi gave himself over to a full-time devotional life. After the appointed time, Yinxi again demonstrates determination and perfect trust, sending out a black sheep to market as the agreed sign. He eventually meets again with Laozi, who announces that Yinxi's immortal name is listed in the heavens and calls down a heavenly procession to clothe Yinxi in the garb of immortals. The story continues that Laozi bestowed a number of titles upon Yinxi and took him on a journey throughout the universe, even into the nine heavens. After this fantastic journey, the two sages set out to western lands of the barbarians. The training period, reuniting and travels represent the attainment of the highest religious rank in medieval Taoism called "Preceptor of the Three Caverns". In this legend, Laozi is the perfect Taoist master and Yinxi is the ideal Taoist student. Laozi is presented as the ''Tao'' personified, giving his teaching to humanity for their salvation. Yinxi follows the formal sequence of preparation, testing, training and attainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Kohn|Lafargue|1998|pp=55–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story of Laozi has taken on strong religious overtones since the [[Han dynasty]]. As [[Taoism]] took root, Laozi was worshipped as a god. Belief in the revelation of the ''Tao'' from the divine Laozi resulted in the formation of the [[Way of the Celestial Masters]], the first organized religious Taoist sect. In later mature Taoist tradition, Laozi came to be seen as a personification of the ''Tao''. He is said to have undergone numerous "transformations" and taken on various guises in various incarnations throughout history to initiate the faithful in the Way. Religious Taoism often holds that the "Old Master" did not disappear after writing the ''Tao Te Ching'' but rather spent his life traveling and revealing the ''Tao''.&lt;ref name="Kohn 3-4"/&gt;

[[Chinese mythology|Taoist myths]] state that Laozi was conceived when his mother gazed upon a falling star. He supposedly remained in her womb for 62 years before being born while his mother was leaning against a [[plum tree]]. (The Chinese surname [[Li (surname 李)|Li]] shares its [[Chinese character|character]] with "plum".) Laozi was said to have emerged as a grown man with a full grey beard and long earlobes, both symbols of wisdom and long life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Simpkins|Simpkins|1999|pp=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Morgan|2001|p=303}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other myths state that he was [[reincarnation|reborn]] 13 times after his first life during the days of [[Fuxi]]. In his last incarnation as Laozi, he lived nine hundred and ninety years and spent his life traveling to reveal the ''Tao''.&lt;ref name="Kohn 3-4"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Kohn|2000|pp=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laozi is traditionally regarded as the author of the ''[[Tao Te Ching]]'' (''Daodejing''), though the identity of its author(s) or compiler(s) has been debated throughout history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Simpkins|Simpkins|1999|pp=11–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Morgan|2001|p=223}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the most significant treatises in Chinese [[cosmogony]]. As with most other ancient [[Chinese philosophers]], Laozi often explains his ideas by way of paradox, analogy, appropriation of ancient sayings, repetition, symmetry, rhyme, and rhythm. In fact, the whole book can be read as an analogy – the ruler is the awareness, or self, in meditation and the myriad creatures or empire is the experience of the body, senses and desires.

The ''Tao Te Ching'', often called simply ''Laozi'' after its reputed author, describes the ''Dao'' (or ''Tao'') as the source and ideal of all existence: it is unseen, but not transcendent, immensely powerful yet supremely humble, being the root of all things. People have desires and free will (and thus are able to alter their own nature). Many act "unnaturally", upsetting the natural balance of the Tao. The ''Tao Te Ching'' intends to lead students to a "return" to their natural state, in harmony with Tao.&lt;!-- ref supports whole of paragraph to this point --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Van Norden|Ivanhoe|2005|p=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Language and [[conventional wisdom]] are critically assessed. Taoism views them as inherently biased and artificial, widely using paradoxes to sharpen the point.&lt;ref name="Kohn-22"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Kohn|2000|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Livia Kohn provides an example of how Laozi encouraged a change in approach, or return to "nature", rather than action. Technology may bring about a false sense of progress. The answer provided by Laozi is not the rejection of technology, but instead seeking the calm state of ''wu wei'', free from desires. This relates to many statements by Laozi encouraging rulers to keep their people in "[[ignorance]]", or "simple-minded". Some scholars insist this explanation ignores the religious context, and others question it as an [[apologetic]] of the philosophical coherence of the text. It would not be unusual political advice if Laozi literally intended to tell rulers to keep their people ignorant. However, some terms in the text, such as "valley spirit" (''gushen'') and "soul" (''po''), bear a metaphysical context and cannot be easily reconciled with a purely ethical reading of the work.&lt;ref name="Kohn-22"/&gt;

''[[Wu wei]]'' (無爲), literally "non-action" or "not acting", is a central concept of the ''Tao Te Ching''. The concept of ''wu wei'' is multifaceted, and reflected in the words' multiple meanings, even in English translation; it can mean "not doing anything", "not forcing", "not acting" in the theatrical sense, "creating nothingness", "acting spontaneously", and "flowing with the moment."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Watts|1975|pp=78–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a concept used to explain ''[[ziran]]'' (自然), or harmony with the ''Tao''. It includes the concepts that value distinctions are ideological and seeing ambition of all sorts as originating from the same source. Laozi used the term broadly with [[simplicity]] and [[humility]] as key virtues, often in contrast to selfish action. On a political level, it means avoiding such circumstances as war, harsh laws and heavy taxes. Some Taoists see a connection between ''wu wei'' and [[esoteric]] practices, such as ''[[zuowang]]'' "sitting in oblivion" (emptying the mind of bodily awareness and thought) found in the Zhuangzi.&lt;ref name="Kohn-22"/&gt;

===Taoism===
{{Main|Taoism}}
Laozi is traditionally regarded as the founder of Taoism, intimately connected with the ''Tao Te Ching'' and "primordial" (or "original") Taoism. Popular ("religious") Taoism typically presents the [[Jade Emperor]] as the official head [[deity]]. Intellectual ("elite") Taoists, such as the [[Way of the Celestial Masters|Celestial Masters sect]], usually present Laozi (''Laojun'', "Lord Lao") and the [[Three Pure Ones]] at the top of the pantheon of deities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Maspero|1981|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Robinet|1997|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Potential officials throughout Chinese history drew on the authority of non-Confucian sages, especially Laozi and [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]], to deny serving any ruler at any time. Zhuangzi, Laozi's most famous follower in traditional accounts, had a great deal of influence on Chinese [[Scholar-bureaucrats|literati]] and culture.

[[Political]] theorists influenced by Laozi have advocated humility in leadership and a restrained approach to statecraft, either for ethical and pacifist reasons, or for tactical ends. In a different context, various anti-authoritarian movements have embraced the Laozi teachings on the power of the weak.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Roberts|2004|pp=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laozi was a proponent of limited government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Dorn|2008|pp=282–283}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Left-libertarianism|Left-libertarians]] in particular have been influenced by Laozi – in his 1937 book ''[[Nationalism and Culture]]'', the [[anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalist]] writer and activist [[Rudolf Rocker]] praised Laozi's "gentle wisdom" and understanding of the opposition between political power and the cultural activities of the people and community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Rocker|1997|pp=256, 82}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1910 article for the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', [[Peter Kropotkin]] also noted that Laozi was among the earliest proponents of essentially [[Anarchism|anarchist]] concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/kropotkin/britanniaanarchy.html |title=Britannica: Anarchism |publisher=Dwardmac.pitzer.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, anarchists such as John P. Clark and [[Ursula K. Le Guin]] have written about the conjunction between anarchism and Taoism in various ways, highlighting the teachings of Laozi in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://raforum.info/spip.php?article4488&amp;lang=fr|author=Clark, John P.|title=Master Lao and the Anarchist Prince|access-date=2011-11-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171020015752/https://raforum.info/spip.php?article4488&amp;lang=fr|archive-date=2017-10-20|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her rendition of the Tao Te Ching, Le Guin writes that Laozi "does not see political power as magic. He sees rightful power as earned and wrongful power as usurped... He sees sacrifice of self or others as a corruption of power, and power as available to anyone who follows the Way. No wonder anarchists and Taoists make good friends."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Le Guin|2009|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Right-libertarianism|right-libertarian]] economist [[Murray Rothbard]] suggested that Laozi was the first [[Libertarianism|libertarian]],&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, Murray (2005). Excerpt from "Concepts of the Role of Intellectuals in Social Change Toward Laissez Faire", ''The Journal of Libertarian Studies'', Vol. IX, No. 2 (Fall 1990) at [https://mises.org/daily/1967 mises.org]&lt;/ref&gt; likening Laozi's ideas on government to [[Friedrich Hayek]]'s theory of [[spontaneous order]].&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, Murray (2005). "The Ancient Chinese Libertarian Tradition", ''Mises Daily'', (December 5, 2005) (original source unknown) at [https://mises.org/daily/1967 mises.org]&lt;/ref&gt; James A. Dorn agreed, writing that Laozi, like many 18th-century liberals, "argued that minimizing the role of government and letting individuals develop spontaneously would best achieve social and economic harmony."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Dorn|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[Cato Institute]]'s [[David Boaz]] includes passages from the ''Tao Te Ching''' in his 1997 book ''The Libertarian Reader''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Boaz|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[Roderick Long]], however, argues that libertarian themes in Taoist thought are actually borrowed from earlier [[Confucian]] writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Long|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Matrilineality''' is the tracing of [[Kinship|descent]] through the female line. It may also correlate with a [[societal system]] in which each person is identified with their '''matriline''' –&amp;nbsp;their mother's [[Lineage (anthropology)|lineage]]&amp;nbsp;– and which can involve the [[inheritance]] of property and/or titles. A matriline is a [[line of descent]] from a [[female]] [[ancestor]] to a [[Kinship|descendant]] (of either [[sex]]) in which the individuals in all intervening generations are mothers{{spndash}}in other words, a "mother line". In a '''matrilineal''' [[Kinship and descent|descent system]], an individual is considered to belong to the same [[descent group]] as their mother. This matrilineal descent pattern is in contrast to the more common pattern of [[patrilineal descent]] from which a [[family name]] is usually derived. The ''matriline'' of historical nobility was also called their '''enatic''' or '''uterine''' ancestry, corresponding to the [[patrilineal]] or "agnatic" ancestry.

In some traditional societies and cultures, membership in their groups was –&amp;nbsp;and, in the following list, still ''is'' if shown in ''italics''&amp;nbsp;– inherited matrilineally.  Examples include the [[Cherokee]], [[Choctaw]], ''[[Gitksan]]'', [[Haida people|Haida]], [[Hopi]], [[Iroquois]], [[Lenape]], [[Navajo people|Navajo]] and [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]] of [[North America]]; the ''[[Kuna people]]'' of Panama; the ''[[Kogi people|Kogi]]'' and [[Kalina people|Carib]] of South America; the ''[[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]]'' people of [[West Sumatra]], [[Indonesia]] and [[Negeri Sembilan]], [[Malaysia]]; the ''[[Trobrianders]]'', ''[[Dobu]]'' and ''Nagovisi'' of Melanesia; the [[Nairs]] of [[Kerala]] and the [[Bunt (community)|Bunt]]s and [[Billava]] of [[Karnataka]] in south [[India]]; the ''[[Khasi people|Khasi]]'', ''[[Synteng|Jaintia]]'' and ''[[Garo (tribe)|Garo]]'' of [[Meghalaya]] in northeast India; the ''[[Ngalop people|Ngalops]]'' and ''[[Sharchops]]'' of [[Bhutan]]; ''[[Muslims]]'' and the ''[[Tamils]]'' in eastern [[Sri Lanka]]; the ''[[Mosuo]]'' of [[China]]; the ''[[Kayah people|Kayah]]'' of Southeast Asia, the [[Basques]] of [[Spain]] and [[France]]; the ''[[Akan people|Akan]]'' including the ''[[Ashanti people|Ashanti]]'' of west [[Africa]]; virtually all groups across the so-called "[[matrilineal belt]]" of south-central Africa; the ''[[Tuareg people|Tuareg]]'' of west and north Africa; the ''[[Serer people|Serer]]'' of [[Senegal]], [[The Gambia]] and [[Mauritania]]; and most ''[[Matrilineality in Judaism|Jewish]]'' communities.

== Early human kinship ==
In the late 19th century, almost all prehistorians and anthropologists believed, following [[Lewis H. Morgan]]'s influential book ''[[Ancient Society]]'', that early human kinship was everywhere matrilineal.&lt;ref&gt;Murdock, G. P. 1949. ''Social Structure.'' London and New York: Macmillan, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; This idea was taken up by [[Friedrich Engels]] in  ''[[The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State]]''. The Morgan-Engels thesis that humanity's earliest domestic institution was not the [[family]] but the matrilineal [[clan]] soon became incorporated into [[Communist theory|communist orthodoxy]]. In reaction, most 20th century social anthropologists considered the theory of matrilineal priority untenable,&lt;ref&gt;Malinowski, B. 1956. ''Marriage: Past and Present. A debate between Robert Briffault and Bronislaw Malinowski,'' ed. M. F. Ashley Montagu. Boston: Porter Sargent.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harris, M. 1969. ''The Rise of Anthropological Theory.'' London: Routledge, p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt; although during the 1970s and 1980s, a range of [[feminism|feminist]] scholars often attempted to revive it.&lt;ref&gt;Leacock, E. B. 1981. ''Myths of Male Dominance. Collected articles on women cross-culturally.'' New York: Monthly Review Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, [[evolutionary biologist]]s, geneticists and [[palaeoanthropologist]]s have been reassessing the issues, many citing genetic and other evidence that early human kinship may have been matrilineal after all.&lt;ref&gt;Hrdy,  S. B. 2009. ''Mothers and others. The evolutionary origins of mutual understanding.'' London and Cambridge, MA: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Knight, C. 2008. [http://www.radicalanthropologygroup.org/old/class_text_105.pdf Early human kinship was matrilineal.] In N. J. Allen, H. Callan, R. Dunbar and W. James (eds.), Early Human Kinship.

== Matrilineal surname ==       &lt;!-- a target for links from other articles --&gt;
{{Main|Matriname}}
{{further|Extinction of surnames}}
''Matrilineal'' [[surname]]s are names transmitted from mother to daughter, in contrast to the more familiar ''patrilineal surnames'' transmitted from father to son, the pattern most common among [[family name]]s today.     For clarity and for brevity, the scientific terms ''patrilineal surname'' and ''matrilineal surname'' are usually abbreviated as ''patriname'' and ''[[matriname]]''.&lt;ref name=sykes&gt;Sykes, Bryan (2001). ''[[The Seven Daughters of Eve]]''. W.W. Norton. {{ISBN|0-393-02018-5}}; pp. 291-2. [[Bryan Sykes]] uses "matriname" and states that women adding their own matriname to men's patriname (or "surname" as Sykes calls it) would really help in future genealogy work and historical record searches. Sykes also states (p. 292) that a woman's matriname will be handed down with her [[mtDNA]], the main topic of his book.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural patterns ==
There appears to be some evidence for the presence of matrilineality in [[Pre-Islamic Arabia]], in a very limited number of the Arabian peoples (first of all among the [[Amorites]] of Yemen, and among some strata of [[Nabateans]] in Northern Arabia);&lt;ref&gt;[[Korotayev]], &amp;nbsp;A.&amp;nbsp;V. (1995), [http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=319&amp;Itemid=70 "Were There Any Truly Matrilineal Lineages in the Arabian Peninsula?" ''Proceedings of the Seminar for Arabian Studies'' 25 (1995); pp. 83-98].&lt;/ref&gt; on the other hand, there does not seem to be any reliable evidence for the presence of matrilineality in Islamic Arabia, although the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] claimed succession from the Islamic [[Prophet Mohammad]] via his daughter [[Fatimah|Fatima]].

A modern example from South Africa is the order of succession to the position of the [[Rain Queen]] in a culture of [[matrilineal succession|matrilineal primogeniture]]: not only is [[dynasty|dynastic]] descent reckoned through the female line, but only females are eligible to inherit.{{fact|date=May 2017}}

=== Clan names vs. surnames ===
Most of the example cultures in this article are based on (matrilineal) [[clan]]s.  Any clan might possibly contain from one to several or many ''[[descent group]]s'' or ''family groups'' – i.e., any matrilineal clan might be descended from one or several or many unrelated female ancestors.  Also, each such descent group might have its own [[family name]] or ''surname'', as one possible cultural pattern.  The following two example cultures each follow a different pattern, however:

Example 1.  Members of the (matrilineal) clan culture [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] do not even have a ''surname'' or ''family name'', see [[#Minangkabau|this culture's own section]] below.  In contrast, members do have a ''clan name'', which is important in their lives although not included in the member's name.  Instead, one's name is just one's [[given name]].

Example 2.  Members of the (matrilineal) clan culture [[Akan people|Akan]], see [[#Akan|its own section]] below, also do not have matrilineal ''surnames'' and likewise their important ''clan name'' is not included in their name.  However, members' names do commonly include second names which ''are called surnames'' but which are ''not'' routinely passed down from either father or mother to all their children as a ''family name''.&lt;ref&gt;de Witte, Marleen (2001). ''Long live the dead!: changing funeral celebrations in Asante, Ghana''. Published by Het Spinhuis. {{ISBN|90-5260-003-1}}, p. 55.  Readers may verify this (i.e., that surnames are not passed down as a family name) by inspecting an actual [[family tree]] on p. 55 via Google Books at https://books.google.com/books?id=Fmf5UqZzbvoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=de+Witte,+Marleen&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=L_ihT5_jM4Tg2gX7_-jaCA&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Adwoa%20Dufie%22&amp;f=false .&lt;/ref&gt;

Note well that if a culture did include one's ''clan name'' in one's name and routinely handed it down to all children in the ''descent group'' then  it would automatically '''be''' the ''family name'' or ''surname'' for one's descent group (as well as for all other descent groups in one's clan).

=== Care of children ===
While a ''mother'' normally takes care of her own children in all cultures, in some matrilineal cultures an "uncle-father" will take care of his nieces and nephews instead: in other words ''social fathers'' here are uncles. There is a disconnection between the role of father and genitor (who in the general case may be unknown anyway). In such matrilineal cultures, especially where residence is also [[matrilocal]], a man will exercise guardianship rights not over the children he fathers but exclusively over his sisters' children, who are viewed as 'his own flesh'. These children's biological father – unlike an uncle who is their mother's brother and thus their caregiver – is in some sense a 'stranger' to them, even when affectionate and emotionally close.&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, D. M. 1961. The distinctive features of matrilineal descent groups. Introduction. In Schneider, D. M. and K. Gough (eds) ''Matrilineal Kinship.'' Berkeley: University of California Press, pp. 1-29.&lt;/ref&gt; This may be true for the traditional [[#Akan|Akan culture below]], for example.

According to [[Steven Pinker]], attributing to Kristen Hawkes, among foraging groups matrilocal societies are less likely to commit female infanticide than are patrilocal societies.&lt;ref&gt;Pinker, Steven, ''The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined'' (N.Y.: Viking, hardback 2011 ({{ISBN|978-0-670-02295-3}})), p.&amp;nbsp;421 (author prof. psychology, Harvard Univ.).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Matrilineality in specific ethnic groups ==

===In Europe===
====Ancient Greece====
While men held positions of religious and political power, Spartan constitution mandated that inheritance and proprietorship pass from mother to daughter.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppGCbh8ggUs&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In the Americas ===

==== Lenape ====
{{Main|Lenape}}
Occupied for 10,000 years by Native Americans, the land that would become New Jersey was overseen by [[clan]]s of the [[Lenape]] or [[Lenni Lenape]] or [[Delaware]], who farmed, fished, and hunted upon it. The pattern of their culture was that of a matrilineal agricultural and mobile hunting society that was sustained with fixed, but not permanent, settlements in their ''matrilineal clan'' territories.  Leadership by men was inherited through the maternal line, and the women elders held the power to remove leaders of whom they disapproved.

Villages were established and relocated as the clans farmed new sections of the land when soil fertility lessened and when they moved among their fishing and hunting grounds by seasons. The area was claimed as a part of the Dutch [[New Netherland]] province dating from 1614, where active trading in furs took advantage of the natural pass west, but the Lenape prevented permanent settlement beyond what is now Jersey City.

"Early Europeans who first wrote about these Indians found matrilineal social organization to be unfamiliar and perplexing. ... As a result, the early records are full of 'clues' about early Lenape society, but were usually written by observers who did not fully understand what they were seeing."&lt;ref&gt;This quote is from [[Lenni-Lenape]]'s [[Lenni-Lenape#Society|Society]] section.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hopi ====
{{Main|Hopi people}}
The [[Hopi people|Hopi]] (in what is now the [[Hopi Reservation]] in northeastern [[Arizona]]), according to Alice Schlegel, had as its "gender ideology&amp;nbsp;... one of female superiority, and it operated within a social actuality of sexual equality."&lt;ref&gt;Schlegel, Alice, ''Hopi Gender Ideology of Female Superiority'', in ''Quarterly Journal of Ideology: "A Critique of the Conventional Wisdom"'', vol. VIII, no. 4, 1984, p. 44 and see pp. 44–52 (essay based partly on "seventeen years of fieldwork among the Hopi", per p. 44 n. 1) (author of Dep't of Anthropology, Univ. of Ariz., Tucson).&lt;/ref&gt; According to LeBow (based on Schlegel's work), in the Hopi, "gender roles&amp;nbsp;... are egalitarian&amp;nbsp;.... [and] [n]either sex is inferior."&lt;ref&gt;LeBow, Diana, ''Rethinking Matriliny Among the Hopi'', ''op. cit.'', p. [8].&lt;/ref&gt; LeBow concluded that Hopi women "participate fully in&amp;nbsp;... political decision-making."&lt;ref&gt;LeBow, Diana, ''Rethinking Matriliny Among the Hopi'', ''op. cit.'', p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Schlegel, "the Hopi no longer live as they are described here"&lt;ref name="Schlegel-HopiGenderIdeoFemaleSuper-p44n1"&gt;Schlegel, Alice, ''Hopi Gender Ideology of Female Superiority'', ''op. cit.'', p. 44 n. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; and "the attitude of female superiority is fading".&lt;ref name="Schlegel-HopiGenderIdeoFemaleSuper-p44n1" /&gt; Schlegel said the Hopi "were and still are matrilinial"&lt;ref name="Schlegel-HopiGenderIdeoFemaleSuper-p45"&gt;Schlegel, Alice, ''Hopi Gender Ideology of Female Superiority'', ''op. cit.'', p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; and "the household&amp;nbsp;... was matrilocal".&lt;ref name="Schlegel-HopiGenderIdeoFemaleSuper-p45" /&gt;

Schlegel explains why there was female superiority as that the Hopi believed in "life as the highest good&amp;nbsp;... [with] the female principle&amp;nbsp;... activated in women and in Mother Earth&amp;nbsp;... as its source"&lt;ref name="Schlegel-HopiGenderIdeoFemaleSuper-p50" /&gt; and that the Hopi "were not in a state of continual war with equally matched neighbors"&lt;ref name="Schlegel-HopiGenderIdeoFemaleSuper-p49"&gt;Schlegel, Alice, ''Hopi Gender Ideology of Female Superiority'', ''op. cit.'', p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; and "had no standing army"&lt;ref name="Schlegel-HopiGenderIdeoFemaleSuper-p49" /&gt; so that "the Hopi lacked the spur to masculine superiority"&lt;ref name="Schlegel-HopiGenderIdeoFemaleSuper-p49" /&gt; and, within that, as that women were central to institutions of clan and household and predominated "within the economic and social systems (in contrast to male predominance within the political and ceremonial systems)",&lt;ref name="Schlegel-HopiGenderIdeoFemaleSuper-p49" /&gt; the [[Clan Mother]], for example, being empowered to overturn land distribution by men if she felt it was unfair,&lt;ref name="Schlegel-HopiGenderIdeoFemaleSuper-p50"&gt;Schlegel, Alice, ''Hopi Gender Ideology of Female Superiority'', ''op. cit.'', p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; since there was no "countervailing&amp;nbsp;... strongly centralized, male-centered political structure".&lt;ref name="Schlegel-HopiGenderIdeoFemaleSuper-p50" /&gt;

==== Iroquois ====
{{Main|Iroquois}}
The [[Iroquois|Iroquois Confederacy or League]], combining five to six Native American [[Iroquois|Haudenosaunee]] nations or tribes before the [[United States|U.S.]] became a nation, operated by [[Great Law of Peace|The Great Binding Law of Peace]], a constitution by which women retained matrilineal-rights and participated in the League's political decision-making, including deciding whether to proceed to war,&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Renée E., ''Iroquois Great Law of Peace and the United States Constitution: How the Founding Fathers Ignored the Clan Mothers'', in ''American Indian Law Review'', vol. 16, no. 2, pp. 497–531, esp. pp. 498–509 (© author 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; through what may have been a matriarchy&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Renée, ''Iroquois Great Law of Peace and the United States Constitution'', in ''American Indian Law Review'', ''op. cit.'', pp. 506–507.&lt;/ref&gt; or "'gyneocracy'".&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Renée, ''Iroquois Great Law of Peace and the United States Constitution'', in ''American Indian Law Review'', ''op. cit.'', p. 505 &amp; p. 506 n. 38, quoting Carr, L., ''The Social and Political Position of Women Among the Huron-Iroquois Tribes, Report of the Peabody Museum of American Archaeology'', p. 223 (1884).&lt;/ref&gt; The dates of this constitution's operation are unknown: the League was formed in approximately 1000–1450, but the constitution was oral until written in about 1880.&lt;ref name="IroquoisGreatLawUSConst-p498"&gt;Jacobs, Renée, ''Iroquois Great Law of Peace and the United States Constitution'', in ''American Indian Law Review'', ''op. cit.'', p. 498 &amp; n. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The League still exists.

=== In Africa ===

==== Akan ====
{{Main|Akan people|Abusua}}
Some 20 million [[Akan people|Akan]] live in Africa, particularly in [[Ghana]] and [[Ivory Coast]].  (See as well their subgroup, the [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]], also called Asante.) Many but not all of the Akan still (2001)&lt;ref name=2001book&gt;de Witte, Marleen (2001). ''Long live the dead!: changing funeral celebrations in Asante, Ghana''. Published by Het Spinhuis. {{ISBN|90-5260-003-1}}. All de Witte (2001) pages referenced below, and many more pages, are available online via Google Books at https://books.google.com/books?id=Fmf5UqZzbvoC&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=Abusua&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=iTRaTdj1N8P7lweKm7XfDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Abusua&amp;f=false .&lt;/ref&gt; practice their traditional matrilineal customs, living in their traditional [[extended family]] households, as follows.  The traditional Akan economic, political and social organization is based on matrilineal lineages, which are the basis of inheritance and succession.  A lineage is defined as all those related by [[matrilineal descent]] from a particular ancestress.  Several lineages are grouped into a ''political unit'' headed by a chief and a council of elders, each of whom is the elected head of a lineage &amp;mdash; which itself may include multiple extended-family households.  Public offices are thus vested in the lineage, as are land tenure and other lineage property.  In other words, lineage property is inherited only by matrilineal kin.&lt;ref name=2001book /&gt;&lt;ref name=encyBr&gt;Busia, Kofi Abrefa (1970). ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 1970.  William Benton, publisher, The University of Chicago. {{ISBN|0-85229-135-3}}, Vol. 1, p. 477.  (This Akan article was written by Kofi Abrefa Busia, formerly professor of Sociology and Culture of Africa at the University of Leiden, Netherlands.)&lt;/ref&gt;

"The principles governing inheritance stress sex, generation and age &amp;mdash; that is to say, men come before women and seniors before juniors." When a woman’s brothers are available, a consideration of generational seniority stipulates that the line of brothers be exhausted before the right to inherit lineage property passes down to the next senior genealogical generation of sisters' sons. Finally, "it is when all possible male heirs have been exhausted that the females" may inherit.&lt;ref name=com.au /&gt;

Each lineage controls the lineage land farmed by its members, functions together in the veneration of its ancestors, supervises marriages of its members, and settles internal disputes among its members.&lt;ref&gt;Owusu-Ansah, David (November 1994). http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+gh0048%29, "Ghana: The Akan Group". This source, "Ghana", is one of the Country Studies available from the US Library of Congress. Archived by WebCite® at https://www.webcitation.org/61M7J7JwT on 31Aug11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The political units above are likewise grouped into eight larger groups called ''[[abusua]]'' (similar to [[clan]]s), named Aduana, Agona, Asakyiri, Asenie, Asona, Bretuo, Ekuona and Oyoko.  The members of each ''abusua'' are united by their belief that they are all descended from the same ancient ancestress. Marriage between members of the same ''abusua'' is forbidden. One inherits or is a lifelong member of the lineage, the political unit, and the ''abusua'' of one's mother, regardless of one's gender and/or marriage. Note that members and their spouses thus belong to different ''abusuas'', mother and children living and working in one household and their husband/father living and working in a different household.&lt;ref name=2001book /&gt;&lt;ref name=encyBr /&gt;

According to this source&lt;ref name=com.au&gt;ashanti.com.au (before 2010). http://ashanti.com.au/pb/wp_8078438f.html, "Ashanti Home Page: The Ashanti Family unit" Archived at WebCite https://www.webcitation.org/5xVwnX0ie?url=http://ashanti.com.au/pb/wp_8078438f.html on 28 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; of further information about the Akan, "A man is strongly related to his mother's brother (wɔfa) but only weakly related to his father's brother. This must be viewed in the context of a [[polygamous]] society in which the mother/child bond is likely to be much stronger than the father/child bond. As a result, in inheritance, a man's nephew (sister's son) will have priority over his own son.  Uncle-nephew relationships therefore assume a dominant position."&lt;ref name=com.au /&gt;

Certain other aspects of the Akan culture are determined [[patrilineally]] rather than matrilineally. There are 12 patrilineal [[Ntoro]] (which means spirit) groups, and everyone belongs to their father's Ntoro group but not to his (matrilineal) family lineage and ''abusua''.  Each patrilineal Ntoro group has its own surnames,&lt;ref&gt;de Witte (2001), p. 55 shows such surnames in a [[family tree]], which provides a useful example of names.&lt;/ref&gt; taboos, ritual purifications, and etiquette.&lt;ref name=encyBr /&gt;

A recent (2001) book&lt;ref name=2001book /&gt; provides this update on the Akan: Some families are changing from the above ''abusua'' structure to the [[nuclear family]].&lt;ref name="de Witte 2001, p. 53"&gt;de Witte (2001), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Housing, childcare, education, daily work, and elder care etc. are then handled by that individual family rather than by the ''abusua'' or clan, especially in the city.&lt;ref&gt;de Witte (2001), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; The above taboo on marriage within one's abusua is sometimes ignored, but "clan membership" is still important,&lt;ref name="de Witte 2001, p. 53"/&gt; with many people still living in the ''abusua'' framework presented above.&lt;ref name=2001book /&gt;

[[Patriarchal]] social structures apply to all of Sri Lanka, but in the [[Eastern Province, Sri Lanka|Eastern Province]] are mixed with the matrilineal features summarized in the paragraph above and described more completely in the following subsection:

===== A matrilineal and patriarchal mixture =====
According to Kanchana N. Ruwanpura, [[Eastern Province, Sri Lanka|Eastern Sri Lanka]] "is highly regarded even among" [[Feminist economics|feminist economists]] "for the relatively favourable position of its women, reflected" in women's equal achievements in [[Human Development Index|Human Development Indices]] "(HDIs) as well as matrilineal and" [[bilateral descent|bilateral]] "inheritance patterns and property rights".&lt;ref&gt;Ruwanpura, (2006), p.1. Accessible online as above.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Humphries, 1993, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;
She also conversely argues that "''feminist economists'' need to be cautious in applauding Sri Lanka's gender-based achievements and/or matrilineal communities",&lt;ref&gt;Ruwanpura, 2006, p. 3. Accessible online as above.&lt;/ref&gt; because these matrilineal communities coexist with "''patriarchal'' structures and ideologies" and the two "can be strange but ultimately compatible bedfellows",&lt;ref&gt;Ruwanpura, 2006, p. 10 and see p. 6 ("prevalence of patriarchal structures and ideologies"). Accessible online as above.&lt;/ref&gt; as follows:

She "positions Sri Lankan women within gradations of ''patriarchy'' by beginning with a brief overview of the main religious traditions," [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], and [[Islam]], "and the ways in which patriarchal interests are promoted through religious practice" in Eastern Sri Lanka (but without being as repressive as classical patriarchy).&lt;ref&gt;Ruwanpura, 2006, pp.&amp;nbsp;4–5.

[while] they have held their ground&amp;nbsp;... [and] provided for their children".&lt;ref&gt;Ruwanpura, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;37.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, she also wrote that feminists including [[Malathi de Alwis]] and [[Kumari Jayawardena]] have criticized a romanticized view of women's lives in Sri Lanka put forward by Yalman, and mentioned the Sri Lankan case "where young women raped (usually by a man) are married-off/required to cohabit with the rapists!"&lt;ref&gt;Ruwanpura, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;76 n.&amp;nbsp;7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Indonesia ====
{{Main|Minangkabau people}}
In the [[Minangs|Minangkabau]] matrilineal [[clan]] culture in [[Indonesia]], a person's [[clan]] name is important in their marriage and their other cultural-related events.&lt;ref name=Sanday&gt;Sanday, Peggy Reeves (Dec2002). http://www.sas.upenn.edu/~psanday/report_02.html, "Report from Indonesia".

Likewise, when [[Minangs]] meet total strangers who share the same clan name, anywhere in Indonesia, they could theoretically expect to feel that they are distant relatives.&lt;ref&gt;Sanday 2004, p.67&lt;/ref&gt; Minang people do not have a family name or surname; neither is one's important clan name included in one's name; instead one's [[given name]] is the only name one has.&lt;ref&gt;Sanday 2004, p.241&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Minangs]] are one of the world's largest matrilineal societies/cultures/ethnic groups, with a population of 4 million in their home province [[West Sumatra]] in Indonesia and about 4 million elsewhere, mostly in Indonesia. The Minang people are well-known within their country for their tradition of matrilineality and for their "dedication to Islam" &amp;mdash; despite Islam being "supposedly patrilineal".&lt;ref name=Sanday /&gt;  This well-known accommodation, between their traditional complex of customs, called [[adat]], and their religion, was actually worked out to help end the Minangkabau 1821-37 [[Padri War]].&lt;ref name=Sanday /&gt; This source is available online.&lt;ref name=Sanday /&gt;

As further described in the same online source, their (matrilineal) ''adat'' and their Islam religion each help the other to avoid the extremes of some modern global trends: Their strong belief in and practice of ''adat'' helps their Islam religion to ''not'' adopt a "simplistic anti-Western" version of Islam, while their strong belief in and practice of both Islam and ''adat'' helps the Minangs to limit or avoid some undesired effects of modern global capitalism.&lt;ref name=Sanday /&gt;

The [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] are a prime example of a matrilineal culture with female inheritance.  With Islamic religious background of [[complementarian]]ism and places a greater number of men than women in positions of religious and political power. Inheritance and proprietorship pass from mother to daughter. The society of Minangkabau exhibits the ability of societies to lack [[rape culture]] without [[social equity]] of genders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peletz|first1=Michael G.|title=The King Is Dead; Long Live the Queen!|journal=American Ethnologist|date=2005|volume=32|issue=1|pages=39–41|doi=10.2307/3805147|jstor=3805147|doi-broken-date=2018-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides Minangkabau, several other ethnics in Indonesia are also matrilineal and have similar culture as the Minangkabau. They are Suku Melayu Bebilang, Suku Kubu and Kerinci people. Suku Melayu Bebilang live in Kota Teluk Kuantan, Kabupaten Kuantan Singingi (also known as Kuansing), Riau. They have similar culture as the Minang. Suku Kubu people live in Jambi and South Sumatera. They are around 200 000 people. Suku Kerinci people mostly live in Kabupaten Kerinci, Jambi. They are around 300 000 people  --

Archaeological data supports the theory that during the [[Neolithic]] period (7000 to 2000 [[BCE]]) in China, Chinese matrilineal clans evolved into the usual patrilineal families by passing through a transitional patrilineal clan phase.&lt;ref name=Zhimin /&gt;  Evidence includes some "richly furnished" tombs for young women in the early Neolithic [[Yangshao]] culture, whose multiple other collective burials imply a matrilineal clan culture.&lt;ref name=Zhimin /&gt; Toward the late Neolithic period, when burials were apparently of couples, "a reflection of patriarchy", an increasing elaboration of presumed chiefs' burials is reported.&lt;ref name=Zhimin /&gt;

Relatively isolated ethnic minorities such as the [[Mosuo]] (Na) in southwestern China are highly matrilineal, and use matrilineal ''family names'', i.e., [[matriname]]s. (See the [[Mosuo#General practice|General practice]] section of the [[Mosuo]] article.)

On [[North Vietnam]], according to Alessandra Chiricosta, the legend of [[Âu Cơ]] is said to be evidence of "the presence of an original 'matriarchy'&amp;nbsp;... and [it] led to the double kinship system, which developed there&amp;nbsp;....

The system of inheritance was known as [[Marumakkathayam]] in the ''Nair'' community or [[Aliyasantana]] in the ''Bunt'' and the [[Billava]] community, and both communities were subdivided into [[clan]]s. This system was exceptional in the sense that it was one of the few traditional systems in western historical records of India that gave women some liberty and the right to property.

In the matrilineal system, the family lived together in a [[tharavadu]] which was composed of a mother, her brothers and younger sisters, and her children. The oldest male member was known as the ''karanavar'' and was the head of the household, managing the family estate. Lineage was traced through the mother, and the children belonged to the mother's family. All family property was jointly owned. In the event of a partition, the shares of the children were clubbed with that of the mother. The karanavar's property was inherited by his sisters' sons rather than his own sons.  (For further information see the articles [[Nair]] and [[Bunt (community)|Bunts]] and [[Billava]].)

== Matrilineal identification within Judaism ==
{{Main|Matrilineality in Judaism}}
Matrilineality in Judaism or matrilineal descent in Judaism is the tracing of [[Judaism|Jewish]] descent through the maternal line. Virtually all Jewish communities have followed matrilineal descent from at least early [[Tannaim|Tannaitic]] (c. 10-70 CE) times to Modern times.&lt;ref name="autogenerated14"&gt;Reviewed by [[Louis Jacobs]], [https://louisjacobs.org/articles/there-is-no-problem-of-descent/] Originally published in Judaism 34.1 (Winter 1985), 55-59.&lt;/ref&gt; The origins and date-of-origin of matrilineal descent in Judaism are uncertain. [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]], who believe that matrilineality and matriarchy within Judaism are related to the metaphysical concept of the Jewish soul,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schaapkens|first1=Natan|title=Inside Orthodox Judaism: A Critical Perspective On Its Theology|isbn=978-1-365-39059-3}} Also, from the perspective of classical Jewish belief, the primary identity of ''all'' people follows the mother. Genesis 20:12, Rashi.&lt;/ref&gt; maintain that matrilineal descent is an Oral Law from at least the time of the Receiving of the Torah on [[Mount Sinai|Mt. Sinai]] (c. 1310 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;Midrash Rabbah, Numbers, 19&lt;/ref&gt; [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative Jewish]] Theologian Rabbi [[Louis Jacobs]] suggests that the marriage practices of the Jewish community were re-stated as a law of matrilineal descent in the early Tannaitic Period (c. 10-70 CE).&lt;ref name="autogenerated14"/&gt;

The law of matrilineal descent was first codified, as all Jewish Oral Law, in the Mishnah (c. 2nd century CE).&lt;ref&gt;Kiddushin 3:12. Interestingly science currently believes that mitochondrial DNA (MtDNA), a human genome that is exceptionally both circular and distinct from Nuclear DNA, is unique in that it is transmitted exclusively by a mother to both her daughters and sons. (Nuclear DNA in a human consists of 22 pairs of autosomes and two sex chromosomes. The 22 pairs of autosomes are derived half from each parent. The two sex chromosomes, XX in females XY in males, are also derived half from each parent. A female inherits one X from her father and one from her mother. Y-DNA, inherited exclusively by a male from his father, contains fewer genes than an X chromosome because it is shorter and is one of his two sex chromosomes, the other being the X that he inherits from his mother.) The Torah may similarly be suggesting that a brother and sister from the same mother are closer than a brother and a sister from just the same father (Genesis 20:12).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Talmud]]&lt;ref&gt;see Kiddushin 68b and Yebamoth 23a&lt;/ref&gt; (c. 500 CE) adduces the law of matrilineal descent from Deuteronomy: you shall not intermarry with them: you shall not give your daughter to his son, and you shall not take his daughter for your son. For he will turn away your son from following Me, and they will worship the gods of others…&lt;ref&gt;Deuteronomy 7:3-4&lt;/ref&gt; Conservative Jewish Theologian Rabbi Louis Jacobs dismisses the suggestion that "the Tannaim were influenced by the Roman legal system..."&lt;ref&gt;In Roman law, without ''connubium'', the right to contract a legal marriage according to Roman Law (i.e. where both parties are Roman citizens and where both parties gave consent), the marriage was not a ''justum matrimonium'', a legal Roman marriage and the children from a such a union had no legal father and therefore followed the status (i.e. Roman citizenship status) of the mother.  Interestingly, “[t]hese restrictions as to marriage were not founded on any enactments; they were a part of that large mass of Roman law which belongs to ''Jus Moribus Constitutum'' [unwritten Roman law].” http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Matrimonium.html&lt;/ref&gt; and that "even if the Rabbis were familiar with the Roman law, they might have reacted to it [instead] by preserving the patrilineal principle, holding fast to their own system." &lt;ref name="autogenerated14"/&gt;

The Jewish Oral Tradition cites the Book of Ezra, Chapters 9, 10, regarding the law of matrilineal descent in Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;Midrash Rabbah, Numbers, 19&lt;/ref&gt; The medieval French commentator, [[Rashi|Rabbi Shlomo Yitzchaki]] (1040-1105 CE) in his commentary on Prophets references the law of matrilineal descent regarding Tamar, daughter of King David.&lt;ref&gt;II Samuel 13:13, Rashi&lt;/ref&gt; Maimonides re-codified the law of matrilineal descent in his compilation of Jewish Law, Mishneh Torah (c. 1170-1180 CE).&lt;ref&gt; Maimonides' Laws of Forbidden Relationships, 15:4.&lt;/ref&gt; The law of matrilineal descent was again re-codified in the Code of Jewish Law, [[Shulchan Aruch]] (1563 CE) without mention of any dissenting opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Even HaEzer 8:5&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hellenized Jewish philosopher, [[Philo|Philo of Alexandria]] (c. 20 BCE – 50 CE) calls the child of a Jew and a non-Jew a ''nothos'' (bastard), regardless of whether the non-Jewish parent is the father or the mother.&lt;ref&gt;''On the Life of Moses'' 2.36.193, ''On the Virtues'' 40.224, ''On the Life of Moses'' 1.27.147&lt;/ref&gt;
While Flavius [[Josephus]] (c. 37-100 CE), the Romanized Jewish historian, writing about events that were alleged to have occurred a century prior, has [[Antigonus II Mattathias]] (c. 63-37 BCE), the last Hasmonean king of Judea, denigrating [[Herod the Great|Herod]] –whose father's family were Idumean Arabs forcibly converted to Judaism by [[John Hyrcanus]] (c. 134-104 BCE)&lt;ref&gt; Josephus, Antiquities, 13.9.1.&lt;/ref&gt; and whose mother, according to Josephus, was either an Idumean Arab&lt;ref&gt; Josephus, Antiquities, 14.7.3.&lt;/ref&gt; or Arabian (Nabatean-Arab)&lt;ref&gt; Josephus, Wars, 1.8.9.&lt;/ref&gt;– by referring to him as "an Idumean i.e. a half-Jew" and as therefore unfit to be given governorship of Judea by the Romans.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, Antiquities, 14.15.2.&lt;/ref&gt;  

In practice, Jewish denominations define "[[Who is a Jew?]]" via descent in different ways. All denominations of Judaism have protocols for [[Conversion to Judaism|conversion]] for those who are not Jewish by descent.

Orthodox Judaism practices matrilineal descent and considers it axiomatic.&lt;ref&gt;see Rabbi Moses Feinstein’s re-affirmation of matrilineal descent,  Elberg, Rabbi S., September, 1984, HaPardes Rabbinical Journal, Hebrew, vol.59, Is.1, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The Conservative Jewish Movement also practices matrilineal descent as virtually all Jewish communities have for at least two thousand years.&lt;ref name="autogenerated14"/&gt; In 1986, the Conservative Movement's Rabbinical Assembly reiterated the commitment of the Conservative Movement to the practice of matrilineal descent.&lt;ref&gt; https://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/sites/default/files/assets/public/halakhah/teshuvot/20012004/31.pdf &lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, the [[Central Conference of American Rabbis]] of [[Reform Judaism]] passed a resolution waiving the need for formal conversion for anyone with at least one Jewish parent, provided that either (a) one is raised as a Jew, by Reform standards, or (b) one engages in an appropriate act of public identification, formalizing a practice that had been common in Reform synagogues for at least a generation. This 1983 resolution departed from the Reform Movement's previous position requiring formal conversion to Judaism for children without a Jewish mother.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/patrilineal1.html Reform Movement's Resolution on Patrilineal Descent]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the closely associated  [[Israel Movement for Reform and Progressive Judaism]] has rejected this resolution and requires formal conversion for anyone without a Jewish mother.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajc.org/site/apps/nl/content3.asp?c=ijITI2PHKoG&amp;b=840313&amp;ct=1051515 Reform Judaism in Israel: Progress and Prospects] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304114546/http://www.ajc.org/site/apps/nl/content3.asp?c=ijITI2PHKoG&amp;b=840313&amp;ct=1051515 |date=4 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Karaite Judaism does not accept Jewish Oral Law as definitive, believing that all divine commandments were recorded with their plain meaning in the written Torah. As such, they interpret the Hebrew Bible to indicate that Jewishness can only follow patrilineal descent. In 1968, the [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]] movement became the first American Jewish movement to pass a resolution recognizing Jews of patrilineal descent.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

== In mythology ==
Certain ancient myths have been argued to expose ancient traces of matrilineal customs that existed before historical records.

The ancient historian [[Herodotus]] is cited by [[Robert Graves]] in his translations of Greek myths as attesting that the [[Lycia]]ns&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]], before 425 [[BCE]]. http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/History_of_Herodotus/Book_1, "History of Herodotus".  Graves's notation is "i.173" meaning in Book 1 – Scroll down to paragraph 173 to find the (matrilineal) Lycians.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Graves, Robert]] (1955, 1960).  ''[[The Greek Myths]], Vol. 1''.  Penguin Books.  {{ISBN|0-14-020508-X}}; p. 296 (myth #88, comment #2).&lt;/ref&gt; of their times "still reckoned" by matrilineal descent, or were matrilineal, as were the [[Caria]]ns.&lt;ref&gt;Graves 1955,1960; p. 256 (myth #75, comment #5).&lt;/ref&gt;

In Greek mythology, while the royal function was a [[male privilege]], power devolution often came through women, and the future king inherited power through marrying the queen heiress.  This is illustrated in the [[Homer]]ic myths where all the noblest men in Greece vie for the hand of [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] (and the throne of [[Sparta]]), as well as the Oedipian cycle where [[Oedipus]] weds the recently widowed queen at the same time he assumes the Theban kingship.

This trend also is evident in many [[Celtic mythology|Celtic myths]], such as the (Welsh) [[mabinogi]] stories of [[Culhwch and Olwen]], or the (Irish) [[Ulster Cycle]], most notably the key facts to the [[Cúchulainn]] cycle that Cúchulainn gets his final secret training with a [[warrior]] woman, [[Scáthach]], and becomes the lover of her daughter; and the root of the [[Táin Bó Cuailnge]], that while [[Ailill mac Máta|Ailill]] may wear the crown of [[Connacht]], it is his wife [[Medb]] who is the real power, and she needs to affirm her equality to her husband by owning chattels as great as he does.

The Picts are widely cited as being matrilineal.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.historyfiles.co.uk/KingListsBritain/GaelsPictland.htm "thanks to the practise of matrilineal descent followed by the Picts, and a large number of eligible would-be kings"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.historyfiles.co.uk/KingListsBritain/EnglandMercia.htm "the Picts are known as strong adherents to the concept of matrilineal descent"&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of other [[Breton people|Breton]] stories also illustrate the motif. Even the [[King Arthur]] legends have been interpreted in this light by some.  For example, the [[Round Table (Camelot)|Round Table]], both as a piece of furniture and as concerns the majority of knights belonging to it, was a gift to Arthur from [[Guinevere]]'s father [[Leodegrance]].

Arguments also have been made that matrilineality lay behind various [[fairy tale]] plots which may contain the vestiges of folk traditions not recorded.

For instance, the widespread motif of a father who wishes to marry his own daughter—appearing in such tales as ''[[Allerleirauh]]'', ''[[Donkeyskin]]'', ''[[The King who Wished to Marry His Daughter]]'', and ''[[The She-Bear]]''—has been explained as his wish to prolong his reign, which he would lose after his wife's death to his son-in-law.&lt;ref&gt;[[Margaret Schlauch|Schlauch, Margaret]] (1969). ''Chaucer's Constance and Accused Queens''. New York: Gordian Press. {{ISBN|0-87752-097-6}}; p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;  More mildly, the hostility of kings to their daughter's suitors is explained by hostility to their successors.  In such tales as ''[[The Three May Peaches]]'', ''[[Jesper Who Herded the Hares]]'', or ''[[The Griffin (fairy tale)|The Griffin]]'', kings set dangerous tasks in an attempt to prevent the marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Schlauch 1969, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fairy tales with hostility between the mother-in-law and the heroine—such as ''[[Mary's Child]]'', ''[[The Six Swans]]'', and Perrault's [[Sleeping Beauty]]—have been held to reflect a transition between a matrilineal society, where a man's loyalty was to his mother, and a patrilineal one, where his wife could claim it, although this interpretation is predicated on such a transition being a normal development in societies.&lt;ref&gt;Schlauch 1969, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Moysés Baumstein''' (June 13, 1931 in [[São Paulo]] &amp;ndash; December 4, 1991 in São Paulo) was a [[Brazil]]ian artist.

Moysés worked in many fields: from literary creation to [[painting]], from [[film making]] to [[holography]].
He was driven by singular curiosity and diligence and typified as a "[[Polymath|Renaissance Man]]" joining science with art throughout his accomplishments.

Baumstein began his artistic career as a painter influenced by the [[Spain|Spanish]] painter [[Joan Ponç]], with whom he founded the group “L´Espai” in [[São Paulo]] in 1960. He later became interested in [[photography]], cinema and theatre and at the beginning of the seventies began to write experimental fiction and produce animation cinema in [[Super 8 mm film|Super8]] and [[16mm]].
In 1981 founded Videcom, a video production house in São Paulo directed for corporate and cultural productions.

It was not until 1982 that he began to work in [[holography]], using [[artisan]]al methods. He completed and perfected his technique in 1983 after a holography workshop with the German artist [[Dieter Jung (artist)]]. In the same year he had his first holographic exhibition at the [[São Paulo Museum of Image and Sound|Museu da Imagem e do Som]] in São Paulo. In 1984 he developed a specific holographic technique for chromatic control and began the regular production of technically very elaborate works.
At that time in his holographic studio he began the production of commercial holograms as well as artistic works.

In some of his projects in this field he worked in collaboration with other Brazilian artists and poets interested in holography ([[Augusto de Campos]], Décio Pignatari, Julio Plaza and José Wagner Garcia). The results of such collaboration were shown at the “Triluz” exhibition (1986) in the Museu da Imagem e do Som, and at the “Idehologia” exhibition (1987) in the Museu de Arte Contemporânea, São Paulo, amongst others.
With José Wagner Garcia he created the prototype of a holographic cinema projector a "Holographic Kinetoscope".

A year after his death a retrospective of his cinema and video works was held at the 9th International “[[Videobrasil]]” Festival - 1992 in São Paulo.

Holographic poems by Augusto de Campos and produced by Baumstein were purchased by the "Centre Régional des Lettres de Basse-Normandie" in [[France]] and in 2007, the holographic poem REVER was exhibited at the exhibition "Concrete Poetry - O Projeto Verbivocovisual" in Tomie Ohtake Institute (São Paulo) and at the Palácio das Artes (Belo Horizonte).

Videcom kept the activities of his holographic laboratory until 2007 when all the equipment was donated to the Optical Lab from the University of Campinas Physics Institute under the responsibility of Jose Lunazzi.

Between September and November 2010 his holograms were presented at the exhibition "TEKHNE" ([http://www.faap.br/hotsites/memorias_reveladas_tekhne/home.asp Tekhne page in English/Portuguese and Spanish]) at Fundação Armando Alvares Penteado (FAAP) in São Paulo, which introduced the discussion of the importance of the convergence between art and technology.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3933">'''Mustaʾmīn''' or '''Musta'man''' (Arabic: مستأمن) is a historical [[Islam]]ic classification for a [[Kafir|non-Muslim]] foreigner,  a ''[[harbi (Islamic law)|harbi]]'' (from ''[[Dar al-Harb]]'', the House of War, i.e. non-Muslim governed territories) who only temporarily resides in Muslim lands (''[[Divisions of the world in Islam#Dar al-Islam (House of Islam)|Dar al-Islam]]'') via a short-term [[safe-conduct]] (''aman mu'aqqat'') which affords the musta'min the protected status of [[dhimmis]] (non-Muslim subjects permanently living in a Muslim-ruled land) without having to pay the [[jizya]].&lt;ref name="Khadduri p. 163"&gt;Khadduri p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; This would include [[merchants]], [[Courier|messengers]], and [[students]] and other groups that could be given an ''aman'', or pledge of security.&lt;ref name="Khadduri p. 163"/&gt; Foreign envoys and emissaries are automatically protected by ''aman''. The imam is permitted to grant an ''aman'' to any number, including entire populations.&lt;ref name="waelhallaq"&gt;{{cite book|last1=[[Wael Hallaq|Wael]]|first1=[[Wael Hallaq|B. Hallaq]]|title=Sharī'a: Theory, Practice and Transformations|date=2009|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-521-86147-2|pages=333}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any private Muslim individual has the juridical competence to grant an ''aman'' to as many as ten who are otherwise denizens of the Dar al-Harb.&lt;ref name="waelhallaq"/&gt;

==Types of safe-conducts==
The short-term safe-conduct can be personal or general:&lt;ref name="Parolin" /&gt;
* Personal aman (''khass'') can be granted by any sane and mature Muslim to one or a group of non-Muslim foreigners (''harbis'').&lt;ref name="Yakoob, Mir p. 109"&gt;Yakoob, Mir p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;
* General aman ('''amm'') can be granted only by the [[caliph]] or his deputy to an unspecified number of harbis. 

The term is valid up to one year for the musta'min, along with his minor children and all the women related to him.&lt;ref name="Parolin"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Parolin|first1=Gianluca P.|title=Citizenship in the Arab world : kin, religion and nation-state|date=2009|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|location=[Amsterdam]|isbn=9089640452|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Hanbalite jurists allowed the period of ''aman'' to one lunar year. Others argued for an indefinite ''aman''.&lt;ref name="waelhallaq"/&gt;

==Legal rights==
Once given amaan, the musta'mins are free to engage in trade and travel.  They are allowed to bring their family and children.  They have permission to visit any [[city]] in Muslim territory except the holy cities of [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]].  A musta'min man is allowed to marry a dhimmi woman and take her back to his homeland; however, musta'min women do not have the same right.&lt;ref&gt;Yakoob, Mir p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;  The musta'min are subject to civil and criminal law in the territory&lt;ref name="Yakoob, Mir p. 109"/&gt; and may not do or say anything that could be construed as harming the interests of Islam.&lt;ref name="Khadduri p. 168"&gt;Khadduri p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;  If caught doing so, the musta'min could be expelled or executed and the amaan grantor could also be penalized.&lt;ref name="Khadduri p. 168"/&gt;

'''Moses ben Nahman''' ({{lang-he-n|מֹשֶׁה בֶּן־נָחְמָן}} ''Mōšeh ben-Nāḥmān'', "Moses son of Nahman"; 1194–1270), commonly known as '''Nachmanides'''&lt;ref&gt;Now also found in the partially translated form '''Nahmanides''' {{IPAc-en|n|ə|ˈ|m|æ|n|ᵻ|d|iː|z|,_|n|ɑː|x|ˈ|m|ɑː|n|ᵻ|d|iː|z}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ({{IPAc-en|n|æ|k|ˈ|m|æ|n|ᵻ|d|iː|z}}; {{lang-el|Ναχμανίδης}} ''Nakhmanídēs''), and also referred to by the acronym '''Ramban''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|r|ɑː|m|'|b|ɑː|n}} ({{Hebrew|רמב״ן}}) and by the contemporary nickname&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Alberch i Fugueras |first1=Ramon |last2=Aragó |first2=Narcís-Jordi |date=1994 |title=The Jews in Girona |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gc4tAQAAIAAJ |location= |publisher=Diputació de Girona |page=27 |isbn=}} "He was called Moises, named after the great desert leader: but the people of Girona, amongst whom he had good friends, knew him as Bonastruc de Porta."&lt;/ref&gt; '''Bonastruc ça Porta''' (literally "[[Mazel tov|Mazel Tov]] near the Gate", see [[wikt:ca:astruc]]), was a leading medieval Jewish scholar, [[Sephardic]] [[rabbi]], [[philosophy|philosopher]], [[physician]], [[Kabbalah|kabbalist]], and [[Jewish commentaries on the Bible|biblical commentator]]. He was raised, studied, and lived for most of his life in [[Girona]], [[Catalonia]]. He is also considered to be an important figure in the re-establishment of the [[Jewish]] community in [[Jerusalem]] following its [[Siege of Jerusalem (1099)|destruction]] by the [[Crusaders]] in 1099.

==Name==
"Nachmanides" (Ναχμανίδης) is a [[Greek language|Greek]]-influenced formation meaning "son of Nahman". He is also commonly known by the Hebrew [[acronym]] {{script|Hebr|&lt;nowiki&gt;רמב&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[gershayim|״]]&lt;nowiki&gt;ן&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} (Ra-M-Ba-N, for ''&lt;u&gt;R&lt;/u&gt;abbeinu &lt;u&gt;M&lt;/u&gt;ōšeh &lt;u&gt;b&lt;/u&gt;ēn-&lt;u&gt;N&lt;/u&gt;āḥmān'', "Our Rabbi Moses son of Nahman"). His [[Catalan language|Catalan]] name was Bonastruc ça Porta (also written ''Saporta'' or ''de Porta''), literally "[[Mazel tov|Mazel Tov]] near the Gate".

==Biography==
Ramban was born in [[Girona]] in 1194, where he grew up and studied (hence he is also called ''Mosheh ben Nahman Gerondi'', or "Moses son of Nahman the Gironan"), and died in the [[Land of Israel]] about 1270.&lt;ref&gt;Bar Ilan CD-ROM&lt;/ref&gt; He was a descendant of Isaac ben Reuben of [[Barcelona]] and cousin of [[Jonah Gerondi]] (Rabbeinu Yonah).&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopaedia Judaica | second edition | vol 14 | pg 741&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jewishencyc"&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/11129-moses-ben-nahman-gerondi Jewish Encyclopedia: Moses ben Nahman Gerondi]&lt;/ref&gt; Among his teachers in [[Talmud]] were [[Judah ben Yakar]] and Nathan ben Meïr of [[Trinquetaille]], and he is said to have been instructed in [[Kabbalah]] (Jewish mysticism) by his countryman [[Azriel of Gerona]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=AZRIEL (EZRA) BEN MENAHEM (BEN SOLOMON) | author= [[Kaufmann Kohler]] &amp; [[Isaac Broydé]]| work=Jewish Encyclopedia | url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=2224&amp;letter=A | accessdate=2006-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was in turn a disciple of [[Isaac the Blind]].

According to the responsa of [[Shlomo ibn Aderet]]&lt;ref&gt;Section 1, responsa 120 and 167&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopaedia Judaica | second edition | vol 14 | pg 741&lt;/ref&gt; Nachmanides studied [[medicine]]. During his teens he began to get a reputation as a learned Jewish scholar. At age 16 he began his writings on [[halakha|Jewish law]]. In his ''Milhamot Hashem'' (Wars of the Lord) he defended [[Isaac Alfasi|Alfasi]]'s decisions against the criticisms of [[Zerachiah ha-Levi of Girona]]. These writings reveal a conservative tendency that distinguished his later works — an unbounded respect for the earlier authorities.&lt;ref name="jewishencyc"/&gt;

In the view of Nachmanides, the wisdom of the rabbis of the [[Mishnah]] and [[Talmud]], as well as the [[Geonim]] (rabbis of the early medieval era) was unquestionable. Their words were to be neither doubted nor criticized. "We bow," he says, "before them, and even when the reason for their words is not quite evident to us, we submit to them" (''Aseifat Zekkenim'', commentary on ''Ketubot''). Nachmanides' adherence to the words of the [[rishonim|earlier authorities]] may be due to piety, or the influence of the northern French Jewish school of thought. However, it is thought that it also may be a reaction to the rapid acceptance of [[greek philosophy|Greco-Arabic philosophy]] among the Jews of Spain and [[Provence]]; this occurred soon after the appearance of [[Maimonides]]' ''[[Guide for the Perplexed]]''. This work gave rise to a tendency to allegorize Biblical narratives, and to downplay the role of miracles. Against this tendency Nachmanides strove, and went to the other extreme, not even allowing the utterances of the immediate disciples of the Geonim to be questioned.&lt;ref name="jewishencyc"/&gt;

== Attitude toward Maimonides ==
Called upon, about 1238, for support by [[Solomon ben Abraham of Montpellier]], who had been excommunicated by supporters of [[Maimonides]], Nachmanides addressed a letter to the communities of [[Aragon]], [[Navarre]], and [[Crown of Castile|Castile]], in which Solomon's adversaries were severely rebuked. However, the great respect he professed for Maimonides (though he did not share the latter's views), reinforced by innate gentleness of character, kept him from allying himself with the anti-Maimonist party and led him to assume the role of a conciliator.&lt;ref name="jewishencyc"/&gt;

In a letter addressed to the French rabbis, he draws attention to the virtues of Maimonides and holds that Maimonides' [[Mishneh Torah]] – his Code of Jewish Law – not only shows no leniency in interpreting prohibitions within Jewish law, but may even be seen as more stringent, which in Nachmanides' eyes was a positive factor. As to Maimonides' ''[[Guide for the Perplexed]]'', Nachmanides stated that it was intended not for those of unshaken belief, but for those who had been led astray by the non-Jewish philosophical works of [[Aristotle]] and [[Galen]]. (Note that Nachmanides's analysis of the ''Guide'' is not the consensus view of modern scholars.) "If," he says, "you were of the opinion that it was your duty to denounce the Guide as heretical, why does a portion of your flock recede from the decision as if it regretted the step? Is it right in such important matters to act capriciously, to applaud the one to-day and the other tomorrow?"&lt;ref name="jewishencyc"/&gt;

To reconcile the two parties Nachmanides proposed that the ban against the philosophical portion of Maimonides's Code of Jewish law should be revoked, but that the ban against the study of the ''Guide for the Perplexed'', and against those who rejected allegorical interpretation of the Bible, should be maintained and even strengthened. This compromise, which might have ended the struggle, was rejected by both parties in spite of Nachmanides' authority.&lt;ref name="jewishencyc"/&gt;

==''Iggrot ha-Kodesh''==
[[File:Ramban Synagogue IMG 0025.JPG|thumb|Ramban's letter to his son displayed on the Ramban synagogue in Jerusalem]]
The book ''Iggeret ha-Kodesh'' (אגרת הקודש - The Holy Epistle) on the topics of marriage, holiness, and sexual relations was commonly attributed to Nachmanides, who supposedly wrote it for his son as a wedding gift. However, modern scholarship attributes it to a different author, perhaps Rabbi [[Joseph ben Abraham Gikatilla]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/iggeret-ha-kodesh jwa.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

In this book, the author criticizes [[Maimonides]] for stigmatizing man's sexual nature as a disgrace to man. In the view of the author, the body with all its functions being the work of God, is holy, and so none of its normal sexual impulses and actions can be regarded as objectionable.

== Views on death, mourning and the resurrection ==
In Nachmanides's ''Torat ha-Adam,'' which deals with mourning rites, burial customs, etc., Nachmanides sharply criticizes writers who strove to render man indifferent to both pleasure and pain. This, he declares, is against the Law, which commands man to rejoice on the day of joy and weep on the day of mourning. The last chapter, entitled ''Shaar ha-Gemul,'' discusses reward and punishment, resurrection, and kindred subjects. It derides the presumption of the philosophers who pretend to a knowledge of the essence of [[God]] and the [[angel]]s, while even the composition of their own bodies is a mystery to them.&lt;ref name="jewishencyc"/&gt;

For Nachmanides, divine [[revelation]] is the best guide in all these questions, and proceeds to give his views on [[Jewish eschatology|Jewish views of the afterlife]]. He holds that as God is eminently just, there must be reward and punishment. This reward and punishment must take place in another world, for the good and evil of this world are relative and transitory.&lt;ref name="jewishencyc"/&gt;

Besides the animal [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], which is derived from the "Supreme powers" and is common to all creatures, man possesses a special soul. This special soul, which is a direct emanation from God, existed before the creation of the world.&lt;ref name="jewishencyc"/&gt; Through the medium of man it enters the material life; and at the dissolution of its medium it either returns to its original source or enters the body of another man. This belief is, according to Nachmanides, the basis of the [[levirate marriage]], the child of which inherits not only the name of the brother of his fleshly father, but also his soul, and thus continues its existence on the earth. The resurrection spoken of by the prophets, which will take place after the coming of the Messiah, is referred by Nachmanides to the body. The physical body may, through the influence of the soul, transform itself into so pure an essence that it will become eternal.&lt;ref name="jewishencyc"/&gt;

== Commentary on the Torah ==
Ramban's commentary on the [[Torah]] (five books of Moses) was his last work, and his most well known. He frequently cites and critiques [[Rashi]]'s commentary, and provides alternative interpretations where he disagrees with Rashi's interpretation. He was prompted to record his commentary by three motives: (1) to satisfy the minds of students of the Law and stimulate their interest by a critical examination of the text; (2) to justify the ways of God and discover the hidden meanings of the words of Scripture, "for in the Torah are hidden every wonder and every mystery, and in her treasures is sealed every beauty of wisdom"; (3) to soothe the minds of the students by simple explanations and pleasant words when they read the appointed sections of the Pentateuch on Sabbaths and festivals.&lt;ref name="jewishencyc"/&gt; His exposition, intermingled with [[aggadah|aggadic]] and [[kabbalah|mystical]] interpretations, is based upon careful [[philology]] and original study of the Bible.&lt;ref name="jewishencyc"/&gt;

His commentary on the creation of the world describes the heavens and the earth being created out of a noncorporeal substance:

{{quote|Now listen to the correct and clear explanation of the verse in its simplicity. The Holy One, blessed be He, created all things from absolute non-existence. Now we have no expression in the sacred language for bringing forth something from nothing other than the word bara (created). Everything that exists under the sun or above was not made from non-existence at the outset. Instead He brought forth from total and absolute nothing a very thin substance devoid of corporeality but having a power of potency, fit to assume form and to proceed from potentiality into reality. This was the primary matter created by G-d; it is called by the Greeks hyly (matter). After the hyly He did not create anything, but He formed and made --things with it, and from this hyly He brought everything into existence. and clothed the forms and put them into a finished condition.&lt;ref&gt;''Ramban (Nachmanides) Commentary on the Torah, Trans. by [[Charles Ber Chavel|Dr. Charles B. Chavel]], (New York: Shilo Publishing House, 1971), p.23''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As in his preceding works, he vehemently attacks the [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosophers]], especially [[Aristotle]], and frequently criticizes [[Maimonides]]' Biblical interpretations. Thus he assails Maimonides' interpretation of Gen. 18:8,&lt;ref&gt;In his "Ma'amar Tehiyyat Hametim" ("Treatise on Resurrection"), Maimonides dismisses as "utter fools" anyone who believes that the three angels who visited Abraham's tent actually "ate" the "curd, and milk, and the calf" that Abraham had prepared for them, despite the explicit language of the text. Instead, Maimonides takes a rationalist approach that, because angels are incorporeal, they do not consume food like ordinary man, and thus it only "appeared" that they were eating, or that Abraham had a prophetic vision of the angels eating. See Fred Rosner, trans., ''Moses Maimonides' Treatise on Resurrection'' (Rowman &amp; Littlefield ed. 2004), {{ISBN|978076575954-2}}, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; asserting that Maimonides' preferred understanding is contrary to the evident meaning of the Biblical words and that it is sinful even to hear it. While Maimonides endeavored to reduce the [[miracle]]s of the Bible to the level of [[nature|natural phenomena]], Nachmanides emphasizes them, declaring that "no man can share in the Torah of our teacher Moses unless he believes that all our affairs, whether they concern masses or individuals, are miraculously controlled, and that nothing can be attributed to nature or the order of the world." See further on this debate under [[Divine Providence#In Jewish thought|Divine Providence]].

Next to belief in [[miracle]]s Nachmanides places three other beliefs, which are, according to him, the [[Jewish principles of faith]], namely, the belief in [[creationism|creation out of nothing]], in the [[omniscience]] of God, and in [[divine providence]].

Nachmanides, in this commentary, often fiercely criticized Rabbi [[Abraham ibn Ezra]], particularly regarding ibn Ezra's negative attitude towards [[Kabbalah]].&lt;ref name="jewishencyc"/&gt; Nevertheless, he had tremendous respect for ibn Ezra, as is evidenced in his introduction to the commentary.

Over time, Nachmanides updated his commentary in at least 250 places, particularly after moving from Spain to the land of Israel. These updates are attested to in different versions of his commentary which survived in manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;[http://alhatorah.org/Commentators:Ramban's_Updates Ramban's Updates to his Torah Commentary], by [http://alhatorah.org alhatorah.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disputation of Barcelona, 1263 ==
{{Main|Disputation of Barcelona}}
Nachmanides, first as rabbi of [[Girona]] and later as chief rabbi of [[Catalonia]], seems to have led a largely untroubled life. When well advanced in years, however, his life was interrupted by an event which made him leave his family and his country and wander in foreign lands. This was the religious disputation in which he was called upon to defend his faith in 1263. The debate was initiated by a [[Pablo Christiani]], a Jewish convert to Christianity, who had been sent by the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[Master of the Order of Preachers|Master General]], [[Raymond de Penyafort]], to King [[James I of Aragon]], with the request that the king order Ramban to respond to charges against Judaism.&lt;ref name="jewishencyc"/&gt;

Pablo Christiani had been trying to make the Jews convert to Christianity. Relying upon the reserve his adversary would be forced to exercise due to fear of offending the feelings of the Christians, Pablo assured the King that he would prove the truth of Christianity from the Talmud and other rabbinical writings. Ramban answered the order of the King, but asked that complete [[freedom of speech]] should be granted. For four days (July 20–24) he debated with Pablo Christiani in the presence of the King, the court, and many churchmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=כתבי הרמב"ן|author=הרמב"ן, |publisher=מוסד הרב קוק}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jewishencyc"/&gt;

The subjects discussed were:&lt;ref name="jewishencyc"/&gt;
# whether the [[Messiah]] had appeared;
# whether the Messiah announced by the [[Prophet]]s was to be considered as divine or as a man born of human parents
# whether the Jews or the Christians were in possession of the true faith.

Christiani argued, based upon several [[Aggadah|aggadic]] passages, that the [[Pharisee]] sages believed that the Messiah had lived during the Talmudic period, and that they ostensibly believed that the Messiah was therefore [[Jesus]]. Nachmanides countered that Christiani's interpretations were distortions; the rabbis would not hint that Jesus was Messiah while, at the same time, explicitly opposing him as such. He further said that if the sages of the Talmud believed that Jesus was the messiah then most certainly they would have been Christians and not Jews, and the fact that the sages of the Talmud were Jews is beyond dispute. Nachmanides proceeded to provide context for the proof-texts cited by Christiani, showing that they were most clearly understood differently than as proposed by Christiani. Furthermore, Nachmanides demonstrated from numerous biblical and talmudic sources that traditional Jewish belief ran contrary to Christiani's postulates.

Nachmanides argued that the Biblical prophets regarded the future messiah as a human, a person of flesh and blood, and not as divine, in the way that Christians view Jesus. He stated that their promises of a reign of universal peace and justice had not yet been fulfilled, that since the appearance of Jesus, the world had been filled with violence and injustice, and that among all denominations the Christians were the most warlike.

&lt;blockquote&gt;[... it seems most strange that... ] the Creator of Heaven and Earth resorted to the womb of a certain Jewish lady, grew there for nine months and was born as an infant, and afterwards grew up and was betrayed into the hands of his enemies who sentenced him to death and executed him, and that afterwards... he came to life and returned to his original place. The mind of a Jew, or any other person, simply cannot tolerate these assertions. You have listened all your life to the priests who have filled your brain and the marrow of your bones with this doctrine, and it has settled into you because of that accustomed habit. [I would argue that if you were hearing these ideas for the first time, now, as a grown adult], you would never accept them.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He noted that questions of the Messiah were of less dogmatic importance to Jews than most Christians imagine. The reason given by him for this bold statement was that it was more meritorious for the Jews to observe the precepts under a Christian ruler, while in exile and suffering humiliation and abuse, than under the rule of the Messiah, when every one would perforce act in accordance with the Law.&lt;ref name="jewishencyc"/&gt;

As the disputation seemed to turn in favor of Nachmanides, the Jews of Barcelona, fearing the resentment of the Dominicans, entreated him to discontinue; but the King, whom Nachmanides had acquainted with the apprehensions of the Jews, desired him to proceed. The controversy was therefore resumed, and concluded in what was considered a complete victory for Nachmanides, who was dismissed by the King with a gift of three hundred gold pieces as a mark of his respect.&lt;ref name="jewishencyc"/&gt; The King remarked that he had never encountered a man who, while yet being wrong, argued so well for his position.

The Dominicans, nevertheless, claimed the victory, and Nachmanides felt obligated to publish the text of the debates. From this publication Pablo selected certain passages which he construed as blasphemies against Christianity and denounced to the head of his order, [[Raymond of Penyafort|Raymond de Penyafort]]. A capital charge was then instituted, and a formal complaint against the work and its author was lodged with the King. James was obliged to entertain the charge, but, mistrusting the Dominican court, called an extraordinary commission, and ordered that the proceedings be conducted in his presence. Nachmanides admitted that he had stated many things against Christianity, but he had written nothing which he had not used in his disputation in the presence of the King, who had granted him freedom of speech.&lt;ref name="jewishencyc"/&gt;

The justness of his defense was recognized by the King and the commission, but to satisfy the Dominicans, Nachmanides was sentenced to exile for two years and his pamphlet was condemned to be burned. He may also have been fined, but this was lifted as a favor to Benveniste ça Porta, who according to some authorities &lt;ref&gt;Graetz, Geschichte der Juden Vol. VII, pp.&amp;nbsp;440–441; Chazan, Barcelona and Beyond, p.&amp;nbsp;199&lt;/ref&gt; was Nachmanides' brother. The Dominicans, however, found this punishment too mild and, through [[Pope Clement IV]], they seem to have succeeded in turning the two years' exile into perpetual banishment.&lt;ref name="jewishencyc"/&gt;

Other scholars&lt;ref&gt;Mayer Kayserling JQR Review 8, 1896, p.&amp;nbsp;494&lt;/ref&gt; believe that the identification of Bonastruc ça Porta with Nachmanides is incorrect.  If so, then there were actually two people who were found to be blasphemous in the same time period and location.

== In Jerusalem ==
{{Yishuv haYashan}}
Nachmanides left Aragon and sojourned for three years somewhere in Castille or in the southern part of the [[Kingdom of France]].&lt;ref name="jewishencyc"/&gt; In 1267, seeking refuge from Christian persecution in Muslim lands,&lt;ref&gt;p. 73 in Jonathan Sacks (2005) ''To Heal a Fractured World: The Ethics of Responsibility''. London: Continuum ({{ISBN|9780826480392}})&lt;/ref&gt; he made [[aliyah]] to [[Jerusalem]]. There he established a synagogue in the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]] that exists until the present day, known as the [[Ramban Synagogue]]. His re-establishment of Jewish communal life in Jerusalem (which had been interrupted by [[Crusades|Crusader]] repression) is notable in that it marked the beginning of almost 700 consecutive Jewish years in Jerusalem until the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]]. Nachmanides then settled at [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], where he was very active in spreading Jewish learning, which was at that time very much neglected in the Holy Land. He gathered a circle of pupils around him, and people came in crowds, even from the district of the Euphrates, to hear him. [[Karaite Judaism|Karaites]] were said to have attended his lectures, among them Aaron ben Joseph the Elder, who later became one of the greatest [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite]] authorities (although Graetz writes that there is no veracity to that). It was to arouse the interest of the Israeli Jews in the exposition of the Bible that Nachmanides wrote the greatest of his works, the above-mentioned commentary on the Torah.&lt;ref name="jewishencyc"/&gt;

[[File:Ramban St sign, Jerusalem.JPG|thumb|left|200px|A street in Jerusalem bears his name]]
Although surrounded by friends and pupils, Nachmanides keenly felt the pangs of exile. "I left my family, I forsook my house. There, with my sons and daughters, the sweet, dear children I brought up at my knees, I left also my soul. My heart and my eyes will dwell with them forever." During his three-year stay in the [[Holy Land]], Nachmanides maintained a correspondence with his native land, by means of which he endeavored to bring about a closer connection between Judea and Spain. Shortly after his arrival in Jerusalem, he addressed a letter to his son Nahman, in which he described the desolation of the Holy City, where there were at that time only two Jewish inhabitants—brothers, dyers by trade. In a later letter from Acre he counsels his son to cultivate humility, which he considers to be the first of virtues. In another, addressed to his second son, who occupied an official position at the Castilian court, Nachmanides recommends the recitation of the daily prayers and warns above all against immorality.&lt;ref name="jewishencyc"/&gt;

==Death and burial==
Nachmanides died in the Holy Land after having passed the age of seventy&lt;ref name="jewishencyc"/&gt; or seventy-six. Different traditions suggest that he was buried in [[Haifa]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/111857/jewish/Ramban.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jewishencyc"/&gt; [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], [[Hebron]], or in the [[Cave of the Ramban]] in [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;http://trip-to-jerusalem.com/rambans-cave/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Works ==
Nachmanides' wrote [[Biblical gloss|glosses]] on the whole [[Talmud]], made compendiums of parts of Jewish law, after the model of Isaac Alfasi.&lt;ref name="jewishencyc"/&gt; His major work on the [[Talmud]] is referred to as ''Chiddushei haRamban''. He often provides a different perspective on a variety of issues that are addressed by the [[Tosefot]].

'''Pacificus Baker, [[Franciscans|O.F.M.]]''' (1695–1774), was an [[English people|English]] [[Franciscan|Minorite]] [[friar]] and noted Catholic spiritual writer of the 18th century.

==Life==
Baker served as the [[Procurator (Catholic Church)|Procurator]] and [[Definitor#Regular definitors|Definitor]] of his Order, and was twice elected [[Provincial superior|Minister Provincial]] of the English [[ecclesiastical province|province]] of the Order of Friars Minor, first in 1761 and again in 1770. He appears to have been attached to the [[Sardinian Embassy Chapel|chapel of the Sardinian Embassy]] on [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]] in London. He certainly attended at the execution of the Scottish Catholic nobleman, [[Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat|Lord Lovat]], on [[Tower Hill]] on 9 April 1747.

Baker's works were mostly guides for meditation for the proper reception of the [[Blessed Sacrament]] and on the [[liturgy|liturgical]] seasons of the Church year. His reputation as a writer suffered in latter years. He was one of several religious authors who developed a series of books to allow Catholics who were isolated from the celebration of the [[Eucharist]] to meditate on its focus in keeping with the [[liturgical year]] of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=JOT&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Toole|first=James M.|work=The Faithful: A History of Catholics in America|title=The Priestless Church|publisher=Harvard University Press|place=Cambridge, Massachusetts|year=2009|pages=28–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baker encouraged the reception of the [[Blessed Sacrament]] by the [[laity]] as often as possible but recognized that, due to the lack of Catholic clergy in Britain in that era, this could be sporadic at best. His works provided the faithful with models for worship on the various Sundays through which they could participate in the liturgical life of the universal Church. His writings also proved popular for isolated Catholics on the American frontier.&lt;ref name=JOT /&gt;

An evaluation of Baker's work in the 19th century described it as "remarkable for unction, solidity, and moderation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=R. B.|last=Kershner|title=Joyce,Bakhtin, and Popular Literature: Chronicles of Disorder|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|year=1989|place=Chapel Hill, N.C.|page=47|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bD6Lstgd2CIC&amp;pg=PA47 |ISBN=0-8078-4387-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baker died in [[London]] on 16 March 1774.

{{IndicText}}

'''Pasasana''' ([[Sanskrit]]: पाशासन; [[IAST]]: ''pāśāsana'') or '''Noose Pose''' is an [[asana]].

LTD.|isbn=978-81-7041-293-9|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
In this yoga asana, the human body creates a 'noose' when the practitioner wraps their arms around their [[squatting position|squatting]] legs with their hands clasped behind their back, while twisting to one side.

==Benefits==
This asana is traditionally said to be therapeutic for mild back, shoulder and neck tension, [[asthma]], [[indigestion]], flatulence, menstrual discomfort and [[sciatica]].{{Citation needed|reason=feb 2010|date=February 2010}}

'''Prillwitz idols''' is a large number of bronze [[figurine]]s and bronze [[relief]] plates allegedly found in late 17th century. The first publication about them, in 1768, further claimed that the figurines found by the village of [[Prillwitz]] (now part of [[Hohenzieritz]]) came from a pagan shrine in [[Rethra]], a major town of [[Polabian Slavs]], and Prillwitz is the location of Rethra.&lt;ref name=pieko&gt;"Słowo o bałwankach przylwickich", in: Franciszek Piekosiński, ''[http://www.sbc.org.pl/dlibra/docmetadata?id=10358 Kamienie mikorzyńskie''], Kraków,  1896 &lt;/ref&gt;

While the story was questioned from the very beginning, many experts believed their authenticity, and disputes about them continued well into the 19th century. Finally, with the progress in research techniques in [[archaeology]] have led to the conclusion that the technique of some of the molds was from recent times, while others, while being apparently authentic, had no evidence of the connection with [[Slavic peoples]]. &lt;ref name=kotb&gt;[http://www.runjewonline.info/p73.html Sfalšowani přibohojo Słowjanow], 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays [[Slavic neopagans]] {{who|date=October 2018}} insist that further research may confirm their authenticity.

'''Ribeauvillé''' ({{IPA-fr|ʁibovije}}; [[Alsatian language|Alsatian]]: ''Rappschwihr''; {{Lang-de|Rappoltsweiler}}) is a [[Communes of France|commune]] in the [[Haut-Rhin]] [[Departments of France|department]] in [[Grand Est]] in north-eastern [[France]].

Its inhabitants are called ''Ribeauvillois''.

== Geography ==
The town is located around {{Convert|10|mi|km|0}} north of [[Colmar]] and {{Convert|75|km|mi|0}}south of [[Strasbourg]]. It lies at the foot of the [[Vosges Mountains]].

==History==
Known in the 8th century as ''Rathaldovilare'', the town passed from the [[Bishops of Basel]] to the Lords of [[Rappoltstein]], who were among the most famous nobles in Alsace. The Lord of Rappoltstein was the King or Protector of the wandering minstrels of the land, who purchased his protection by paying him a tax.

When the family became extinct in 1673, this office of "King of the Pipers" (''Pfeiferkönig'') passed to the Counts Palatine of [[Zweibrücken-Birkenfeld]]. The minstrels had a pilgrimage chapel near Rappoltsweiler, dedicated to their patron saint, [[Maria von Dusenbach]], and here they held an annual feast on 8 September. Ribeauvillé was commonly known as ''Rappoltsweiler'' until the 19th century.

==Sights==
Ribeauvillé is in part surrounded by ancient walls, and has many picturesque medieval houses, and two old churches, of [[St Gregory]] and [[Augustine of Hippo|St Augustine]], both fine Gothic buildings. The town hall contains a valuable collection of antiquities. The Carolabad, a saline spring with a temperature of 64 F. (which held a great reputation in the Middle Ages), was re-discovered in 1888, and made Rappoltsweiler a watering-place.

Near the town are the ruins of three famous castles, [[Château de Saint-Ulrich|Saint-Ulrich]], [[Château du Girsberg|Girsberg]] and [[Château du Haut-Ribeaupierre|Haut-Ribeaupierre]], which formerly belonged to the lords of Ribeaupierre (or Rappoltstein).

The forest  of Ribeauvillé is home to the largest [[Sequoiadendron_giganteum|giant sequoia]] outside of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Giant sequoia in the forêt domaniale de Ribeauvillé [https://www.monumentaltrees.com/en/fra/hautrhin/ribeauville/6150_foretdomanialederibeauville/12175/]&lt;/ref&gt;

The former [[synagogue]] of the Jewish community is located on the Rue de la Synagogue and is currently used as the town's cinema.

==Economy==
The economy of Ribeauvillé is mainly based on:

* Tourism, because of its historical heritage and several festivals as, for example ''Fête des Ménétriers '' or " Pfifferdaj" (first week-end of September) and ''Marché de Noël'' (Christmas);
* [[Viticulture]]: Ribeauvillé is located in the middle of the [[Alsace wine]]yards and is home to many [[viticulturist]]s. Most of them are associated in a [[winemaking co-operative]] named ''Cave de Ribeauvillé'' (established 1895), one of the oldest in France;&lt;ref&gt;Cooperative website [http://alsace.vins-ribeauville.com/ alsace.vins-ribeauville.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130318030137/http://alsace.vins-ribeauville.com/ |date=2013-03-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Manufacturing: There is a [[Sony]] factory located nearby.

==Notable people==
* [[Philipp Jakob Spener]] (1635–1705), Lutheran theologian
* [[Johann Baptist Wendling]] (1723–1797), flautist and composer
* [[Jean-Michel Beysser]] (1753–1794), French general

The '''Rimé movement''' is a movement involving the [[Sakya]], [[Kagyu]] and [[Nyingma]] schools of [[Tibetan Buddhism]], along with some [[Bon]] scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Lopez, Donald S. (1998). ''Prisoners of Shangri-La: Tibetan Buddhism and the West''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt;

Having seen how the [[Gelug]] institutions pushed the other traditions into the corners of Tibet's cultural life, [[Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo]] (1820-1892) and [[Jamgon Kongtrul|Jamgön Kongtrül]] (1813-1899) compiled together the teachings of the [[Sakya]], [[Kagyu]] and [[Nyingma]], including many near-extinct teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Schaik, Sam van. ''Tibet: A History''. Yale University Press 2011, page 165-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Without Khyentse and Kongtrul's collecting and printing of rare works, the suppression of Buddhism by the Communists would have been much more final.&lt;ref&gt;Schaik, Sam van. ''Tibet: A History''. Yale University Press 2011, page 169.&lt;/ref&gt; The Rimé movement is responsible for a number of scriptural compilations, such as the ''[[Nyingma#Rinchen Terdzod|Rinchen Terdzod]]'' and the ''[[Sheja Dzö]]''.

==The Rimé approach==

Most scholars of Buddhism explain Rimé as an "[[Eclecticism|eclectic]] movement",&lt;ref&gt;Damien Keown: Oxford ''Dictionary of Buddhism'', p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Dreyfus, Georges B.J. &amp; Sara L. McClintock (eds). ''The Svatantrika-Prasangika Distinction: What Difference Does a Difference Make?'' Wisdom Publications, 2003, p. 320&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Samuel, Geoffrey. (1993). ''Civilized shamans: Buddhism in Tibetan societies''. Washington DC: Smithsonian Institution Press, pp. 538, 546&lt;/ref&gt; however one scholar has suggested that this is an inadequate rendering, saying "In fact this Rimé movement was not exactly eclectic but [[universalistic]] (and encyclopaedic), ''rimed (pa)'' (the antonym of ''risu ch'edpa'') meaning unbounded, all-embracing, unlimited, and also impartial."&lt;ref&gt;Seyfort Ruegg quoted in Samuel, Goeffrey (1993). ''Civilized Shamans. Buddhism in Tibetan Societies'', p. 538&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most prominent contemporary Rimé masters, Ringu Tulku, emphasizes the message of the original Rimé founders, that it is not a new school.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kxd_VOH1aI Ri-Mé_Approach]. YouTube (26 January 2008). Retrieved 20 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is simply an approach allowing freedom of choice which was always the majority practice within the history of Tibetan Buddhism. The [[Karmapa]]s, [[Je Tsongkhapa]], the [[Dalai Lama]]s, [[Sakya]] lineage heads and major [[Nyingma]] and [[Kagyu]] figures took teachings and empowerments from various schools and lineages.

The movement's name is derived from two [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]] words: ''Ris'' (bias, side) and ''Med'' (lack), which combined expresses the idea of openness to other Tibetan Buddhist traditions, as opposed to [[sectarianism]]. The Rimé movement therefore is often misunderstood as trying to unite the various [[sect]]s through their similarities. Rather Rimé was intended to recognize the differences between traditions and appreciate them, while also establishing a dialogue which would create common ground. It is considered important that variety be preserved, and therefore Rimé teachers are generally careful to emphasize differences in thought, giving students many options as to how to proceed in their spiritual training.

Ringu Tulku describes these points which are often misrepresented:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Ris'' or ''Phyog-ris'' in Tibetan means "one-sided", "partisan" or "sectarian". ''Med'' means "No". ''Ris-med'' (Wylie), or ''Rimé'', therefore means "no sides", "non-partisan" or "non-sectarian". It does not mean "non-conformist" or "non-committal"; nor does it mean forming a new School or system that is different from the existing ones. A person who believes the Rimé way almost certainly follows one lineage as his or her main practice. He or she would not dissociate from the School in which he or she was raised. Kongtrul was raised in the Nyingma and Kagyu traditions; Khyentse was reared in a strong Sakyapa tradition. They never failed to acknowledge their affiliation to their own Schools.&lt;ref&gt;The Ri-me Philosophy of Jamgön Kongtrul the Great: A Study of the Buddhist Lineages of Tibet, [http://info-buddhism.com/Rime_Movement-Ringu_Tulku.html Chapter I], Shambhala Publications, 2006. Retrieved 15 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rimé is not a way of uniting different Schools and lineages by emphasizing their similarities. It is basically an appreciation of their differences and an acknowledgement of the importance of having this variety for the benefit of practitioners with different needs. Therefore the Rimé teachers always take great care that the teachings and practices of the different Schools and lineages and their unique styles do not become confused with one another. To retain the original style and methods of each teaching lineage preserves the power of that lineage experience. Kongtrul and Khyentse made great efforts to retain the original flavor of each teaching, while making them available to many. Kongtrul writes about Khyentse in his biography of the latter.... When he (Khyentse Rinpoche) taught, he would give the teachings of each lineage clearly and intelligibly without confusing the terms and concepts of other teachings.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.abuddhistlibrary.com/Buddhism/A%20-%20Tibetan%20Buddhism/Authors/Ringu%20Tulku/The%20Rime%20Movement/THE%20RIME%20%28%20Ris-med%20%29%20MOVEMENT.htm The Rime ( Ris-Med ) Movement]. Abuddhistlibrary.com (24 July 2000). Retrieved 2 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rimé was initially intended to counteract the novel growing suspicion and tension building between the different traditions, which at the time had, in many places, gone so far as to forbid studying one another's scriptures. Tibetan Buddhism has a long history of vigorous debate and argumentation between schools and within one's training. This can lead a practitioner to believe that one's school has the best approach or highest philosophic view and that other lineages have a lower or flawed understanding. The Rimé approach cautions against developing that viewpoint, while at the same time appreciating that the debate and discussion is important and that arguing which views are higher and lower is still valid discourse.

Jamgon Kongtrul pointed out the necessity of each practitioner to have a strong foundation in one school:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The scholars and siddhas of the various schools make their own individual presentations of the dharma. Each one is full of strong points and supported by valid reasoning. If you are well grounded in the presentations of your own tradition, then it is unnecessary to be sectarian. But if you get mixed up about the various tenets and the terminology, then you lack even a foothold in your own tradition. You try to use someone else's system to support your understanding, and then get all tangled up, like a bad weaver, concerning the view, meditation, conduct, and result. Unless you have certainty in your own system, you cannot use reasoning to support your scriptures, and you cannot challenge the assertions of others. You become a laughing stock in the eyes of the learned ones. It would be much better to possess a clear understanding of your own tradition.

In summary, one must see all the teachings as without contradiction, and consider all the scriptures as instructions. This will cause the root of [[sectarianism]] and prejudice to dry up, and give you a firm foundation in the Buddhas teachings. At that point, hundreds of doors to the eighty-four thousand teachings of the dharma will simultaneously be open to you.&lt;ref&gt;The Ri-Me Philosophy of Jamgon Kongtrul the Great: A Study of the Buddhist Lineages of Tibet by Ringu Tulku, [http://info-buddhism.com/Rime_Movement-Ringu_Tulku.html Chapter I], {{ISBN|1-59030-286-9}}, Shambhala Publications, Publications, 2006. Retrieved 15 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A rimé practitioner may take empowerments from numerous lineages and living masters, though it is not a requirement to do so.

==Rimé's founders==
Two of the founding voices of Rimé were [[Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo]] and [[Jamgon Kongtrul]], both from different schools; the epithets ''Jamyang'' ({{bo|w='jam dbyangs}}, {{lang-sa|Mañjughoṣa|script=Latn}}) and ''Jamgön'' ({{bo|w='jam mgon}}, {{lang-sa|Mañjunātha|links=no|script=Latn}}) in their name indicating that they are considered to be emanations of [[Manjushri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Samuel|first=Geoffrey|authorlink=Geoffrey Samuel|title=CIVILIZED SHAMANS PB|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JsVcPwAACAAJ|date=17 September 1995|publisher=Smithsonian|isbn=978-1-56098-620-1|page=538}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jamgön Kongtrul was from the [[Nyingma]] and [[Kagyu]] traditions, while Wangpo had been raised within the [[Sakya]] order. At the time, Tibetan schools of thought had become very isolated, and both Wangpo and Jamgon Kongtrul were instrumental in re-initiating dialogue between the sects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ringu Tulku|authorlink=Ringu Tulku|title=The Ri-Me Philosophy of Jamgon Kongtrul the Great: A Study of the Buddhist Lineages of Tibet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p8l0Qwl9gdcC|year=2007|publisher=Shambhala Publications|isbn=978-1-59030-464-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rachel H. Pang has noted that non-sectarian ideals are also strongly present in the works of [[Shabkar Tsokdruk Rangdrol]] even though he predates the movement by about three decades and never met with any of the Rimé masters from [[Kham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pang|first1=Rachel H.|title=The Rimé Activities of Shabkar Tsokdruk Rangdrol (1781-1851)|journal=Revue d’Etudes Tibétaines|date=October 2014|volume=30|url=http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/ret/pdf/ret_30_01.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rimé movement came to prominence at a point in Tibetan history when the religious climate had become partisan.&lt;ref name=GKLT-I&gt;{{cite book|author=Jamgon Kongtrul|authorlink=Jamgon Kongtrul|title=The Treasury of Knowledge: Book Six, Part Three: Frameworks Of Buddhist Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ffp8_KZMYUEC|year=2007|publisher=Shambhala|isbn=978-1-55939-883-1|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of the movement was "a push towards a middle ground where the various views and styles of the different traditions were appreciated for their individual contributions rather than being refuted, marginalized, or banned."&lt;ref name=GKLT-I/&gt; Many of the teachings of various schools were close to being lost and  the movement set out to preserve them.&lt;ref name=GKLT-I/&gt; However, though the Rimé movement gathered together teachings from each of the various traditions, it did not mix these, but recognised the individual integrity of each.&lt;ref name=GKLT-I/&gt;

The movement began within a large context of increasing domination by the [[Gelug]] school. Beginning in the 17th century, the Gelug view and politics increasingly dominated in Tibet and the minority lineages were at risk for losing their traditions.&lt;ref name="dreyfus320" &gt;Dreyfus (2003) p.320&lt;/ref&gt; At its founding, the Rimé movement was primarily non-Gelugpa teachers and at times the movement has appeared critical of Gelug views. [[Georges Dreyfus]] suggests this argumentation was less to create further division but was to bolster minority views that had been marginalized by Gelug supremacy. Nonetheless, philosophic commentaries by early Rimé writers tend to criticize Gelugpa tenets.&lt;ref name="dreyfus320" /&gt;

However, Rimé was in its idealized presentation the reestablishment of a rule or principle that had always been present in Tibetan Buddhism, but that had been de-emphasized or forgotten: To ignorantly criticize other traditions was wrong, and that misunderstandings due to ignorance should be immediately alleviated. Ringu Tulku says:
{{quote|The Rimé concept was not original to Kongtrul and Khyentse – neither were they new to Buddhism! The Lord Buddha forbade his students even to criticise the teachings and teachers of other religions and cultures. The message was so strong and unambiguous that [[Candrakīrti|Chandra Kirti]] had to defend [[Nagarjuna]]'s treatises on [[Madhyamaka|Madhyamika]] by saying, "If, by trying to understand the truth, you dispel the misunderstandings of some people and thereby some philosophies are damaged – that cannot be taken as criticising the views of others" ([[Madhyamakāvatāra|''Madhyamika-avatara'']]). A true Buddhist cannot be but non-sectarian and Rimé in their approach.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;}}

The movement became particularly well-established in the [[Kingdom of Derge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Huber | first = Toni | title =  The Holy Land Reborn: Pilgrimage &amp; the Tibetan Reinvention of Buddhist India | publisher = University of Chicago Press | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-226-35648-5 | page = 116 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=SjzSpGf1eM0C&amp;pg=PA116&amp;dq=Derge+kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rimé has become an integral part of the Tibetan tradition, and continues to be an important philosophy in Tibetan Buddhism.

Other notable Tibetan Lamas noted for their non-sectarian approach were [[Patrul Rinpoche]] and [[Orgyen Chokgyur Lingpa]]. Shabkar Tsodruk Rangdrol, [[Dudjom Lingpa]] and the [[Khakyab Dorje, 15th Karmapa Lama]], who was a student of Jamgön Kongtrul. Other lineage leaders gave their blessing to the movement and its founders who were considered extremely realized.

==Persecution by Phabongkha and his disciples==
David Kay notes that [[Dorje Shugden]] was a key element in [[Pabongkhapa Déchen Nyingpo]]'s persecution of the Rimé movement:
{{quote|As the Gelug agent of the Tibetan government in Kham (Khams) (Eastern Tibet), and in response to the Rimed movement that had originated and was flowering in that region, Phabongkha Rinpoche and his disciples employed repressive measures against non-Gelug sects. Religious artefacts associated with Padmasambhava – who is revered as a ‘second Buddha’ by Nyingma practitioners – were destroyed, and non-Gelug, and particularly Nyingma, monasteries were forcibly converted to the Gelug position. A key element of Phabongkha Rinpoche’s outlook was the cult of the protective deity Dorje Shugden, which he married to the idea of Gelug exclusivism and employed against other traditions as well as against those within the Gelug who had eclectic tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;Kay, D. N. (2004). ''Tibetan and Zen Buddhism in Britain: Transplantation, development and adaptation''. RoutledgeCurzon critical studies in Buddhism. London: RoutledgeCurzon. p.43.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|His teaching tour of Kham in 1938 was a seminal phase, leading to a hardening of his exclusivism and the adoption of a militantly sectarian stance. In reaction to the flourishing Rimed movement and the perceived decline of Gelug monasteries in that region, Phabongkha and his disciples spearheaded a revival movement, promoting the supremacy of the Gelug as the only pure tradition. He now regarded the inclusivism of Gelug monks who practised according to the teachings of other schools as a threat to the integrity of the Gelug tradition, and he aggressively opposed the influence of other traditions, particularly the Nyingma, whose teachings were deemed mistaken and deceptive. A key element of Phabongkha’s revival movement was the practice of relying upon Dorje Shugden, the main function of the deity now being presented as "the protection of the Ge-luk tradition through violent means, even including the killing of its enemies."&lt;ref&gt;Kay, D. N. (2004). ''Tibetan and Zen Buddhism in Britain: Transplantation, development and adaptation''. RoutledgeCurzon critical studies in Buddhism. London: RoutledgeCurzon. p.47.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Rimé movement, primarily composed of the [[Sakya]], [[Kagyu]] and [[Nyingma]] schools, arose in the first place as a result of Gelug persecution.&lt;ref&gt;Schaik, Sam van. ''Tibet: A History''. Yale University Press 2011, page 165-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present-day Rimé movement==
The movement's achievements have been successful in the 20th century where taking teachings and transmissions from different schools and lineages has become the norm amongst many monastic students, lamas, yogis as well as lay practitioners. This has mainly been due to the proactive support of many lineage holders and various leaders such as the [[13th Dalai Lama|13th]] and [[14th Dalai Lama]]s, the [[Khakyab Dorje, 15th Karmapa Lama|15th]] and [[Rangjung Rigpe Dorje, 16th Karmapa|16th Karmapas]], [[Sakya Trizin]] and [[Dudjom Jigdral Yeshe Dorje]], following the "eclectic" approach of the 5th Dalai Lama "who blurred the lines between traditions":&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;{{quote|In the West, where so many different Buddhist traditions exist side by side, one needs to be constantly on one's guard against the danger of sectarianism. Such a divisive attitude is often the result of failing to understand or appreciate anything outside one's own tradition. Teachers from all schools would therefore benefit greatly from studying and gaining some practical experience of the teachings of other traditions.&lt;ref&gt;An Open Letter by The Network for Western Buddhist Teachers, ''Tricycle'', Fall 1993&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The 14th Dalai Lama composed a prayer for the movement praising various historic figures and lineages of [[Vajrayana|Vajrayana Buddhism]] from India and Tibet, part of which says:

:In short, may all the teachings of the Buddha in the Land of Snows
:Flourish long into the future— the ten great pillars of the study lineage,
:And the chariots of the practice lineage, such as Shijé (‘Pacifying’) and the rest,
:All of them rich with their essential instructions combining sutra and mantra.

:May the lives of the masters who uphold these teachings be secure and harmonious!
:May the sangha preserve these teachings through their study, meditation and activity!
:May the world be filled with faithful individuals intent on following these teachings!
:And long may the non-sectarian teachings of the Buddha continue to flourish!&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lotsawahouse.org/tibetan-masters/living-masters/dalai-lama/harmonious-song-truth Dalai Lama | Sage's Harmonious Song of Truth]. Lotsawa House (28 February 1999). Retrieved 20 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dzongsar Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö]], [[Khunu Lama Tenzin Gyaltsen]] and [[Dilgo Khyentse]] are recent Rimé masters, known for their public influence and as being advisers and teachers to the 14th Dalai Lama. Other modern adherents include the late [[Rangjung Rigpe Dorje, 16th Karmapa|16th Karmapa]] and 2nd Dudjom Rinpoche, both of whom gave extensive teachings from the works of Jamgon Kongtrul Lodro, as well as [[Akong Rinpoche]] who, with the late [[Chögyam Trungpa]], helped establish Tibetan Buddhism in the [[United Kingdom]]. The lineage of the late [[Nyoshul Khenpo Rinpoche]] is represented today in the teachings of [[Surya Das]].

The 14th Dalai Lama supports and encourages a non-sectarian spirit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tibet.com/dholgyal/hhdl.html His Holiness the Dalai Lama's response to media a question on Shugden at the press conference in Indianapolis on 16 August 1999] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514154615/http://www.tibet.com/dholgyal/hhdl.html |date=14 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dalai Lama and Sogyal Rinpoche (2007) ''Mind in Comfort and Ease: The Vision of Enlightenment in the Great Perfection'' {{ISBN|0-86171-493-8}} page xiii&lt;/ref&gt; Major Gelug figures like Shabkar in the 19th century, and the Panchen Lamas and Reting Rinpoche in the 20th century studied Nyingma teachings along with their Gelug training.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.simhas.org/chatral.html Simhanada-The Lord of Refuge Chatral Rinpoche] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603175322/http://www.simhas.org/chatral.html |date=3 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shabkar.org/teachers/tibetanbuddhism/chatral_rinpoche.htm Kyabje Chatral Sangye Dorje Rinpoche | Vegetarianism &amp; Saving Lives (Tsethar)].

[[Bön]] teacher [[Tenzin Wangyal]] cautions, however, that even this so-called non-sectarian attitude may be taken to an extreme:
{{quote|A problem that seems very difficult to avoid involves the tendency of spiritual schools either to want to preserve their traditions in a very closed way or to want to be very open and nonsectarian; but there is often the danger that this very nonsectarianism can become a source of [[self-justification]] and lead to as closed an attitude as that of the sectarians.&lt;ref&gt;Wangyal, Tenzin (1993).

After beginning his career as a [[stand-up comedian]] and later becoming an [[MTV]] presenter, Brand first achieved renown in 2004 as the host of ''[[Big Brother's Big Mouth]]'', a ''[[Big Brother (UK)|Big Brother]]'' spin-off. In 2007, he had his first major film role in ''[[St Trinian's (film)|St Trinian's]]'', and the following year he landed a major role in the romantic comedy-drama ''[[Forgetting Sarah Marshall]]''; the film led to him starring in a spin off, the rock comedy ''[[Get Him to the Greek]]'', alongside [[Jonah Hill]] in 2010. He also worked as a voice actor in the animated films ''[[Despicable Me]]'' in 2010, ''[[Hop (film)|Hop]]'' in 2011, and ''[[Despicable Me 2]]'' in 2013, and played the title character of the 2011 remake of the romantic comedy ''[[Arthur (2011 film)|Arthur]]''. In 2013, he released the successful stand-up special ''Messiah Complex''.

Over the course of his career, Brand has been the subject of frequent media coverage and controversy for issues such as his promiscuity and drug use, his outrageous behaviour at various award ceremonies, his dismissal from MTV and resignation from the [[BBC]], and his two-year marriage with singer [[Katy Perry]]. He has incorporated many of his controversial public antics into his comedic material. In 2015 a biographical documentary called ''Brand: A Second Coming'' was released.

==Early life==
Russell Edward Brand was born in Orsett Hospital in [[Grays]], Essex, England. He is the only child of Barbara Elizabeth (''née'' Nichols) and photographer Ronald Henry Brand.&lt;ref name=Family/&gt; Brand's parents separated when he was six months old, and he was raised by his mother.&lt;ref name="Sawyer"&gt;Miranda Sawyer [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/nov/09/russell-brand-sachsgate "Brand on the run"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506122617/http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/nov/09/russell-brand-sachsgate |date=6 May 2016 }}, ''The Observer'', 9 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sean O'Neill Crime Editor|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/stage/comedy/article4950820.ece|title=Russell Brand: I'm a spiritual gent with a crazed lust for glamour|publisher=Entertainment.timesonline.co.uk|accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Brand was 8, his mother contracted [[uterine cancer]] and then [[breast cancer]] one year later. While she underwent treatment, Brand lived with relatives. When he was 14, he suffered from [[bulimia nervosa]]. When he was 16, he left home because of disagreements with his mother's partner. Brand then started to use illegal drugs such as cannabis, [[amphetamine]]s, [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], and [[MDMA|ecstasy]].&lt;ref name="Relative"&gt;{{cite web|author=Sean O'Neill Crime Editor|url=http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/the_way_we_live/article3074117.ece|title=Relative values: Russell Brand and his mother, Barbara|publisher=Women.timesonline.co.uk|accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brand says he had a "strange relationship" with his father, whom he saw sporadically and who took him to visit prostitutes during a trip to [[Thailand]] when Brand was a teenager.&lt;ref name="Sawyer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NPR Booky Wook"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=101881014|title=A Comedian's Memoir Of Sex, Drugs And Stand-Up|last=Simon|first=Scott|date=14 March 2009|work=Weekend Edition Saturday|publisher=National Public Radio|accessdate=14 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his theatrical debut at the age of 15 in a school production of ''[[Bugsy Malone]]'', and then began work as a film extra. Brand attended [[Grays School Media Arts College]] and in 1991, he was accepted to the [[Italia Conti Academy]] and had his first year of tuition funded by [[Essex County Council]]. After his first year at Italia Conti Academy, Brand was expelled for illegal drug use and poor attendance.&lt;ref name=ddrb&gt;{{cite news|last=Brand|first=Russell|title=Desert Island Discs|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Stand-up===
[[File:Russell Brand 2008.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Brand performs stand-up at the London Roundhouse, 25 January 2008]]
Brand performed [[Stand-up comedy|stand-up]] at the [[Hackney Empire New Act of the Year]] final in 2000. Although he finished fourth, his performance attracted the attention of ''Bound and Gagged Comedy Ltd'' agent Nigel Klarfeld.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agents-uk.com/agents/short_info/682 |title=Bound &amp; Gagged Comedy Ltd |publisher=Agents-uk.com |accessdate=31 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106064858/http://www.agents-uk.com/agents/short_info/682 |archivedate=6 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, he also made his [[Edinburgh Fringe|Edinburgh]] debut as one-third of the stand-up show ''Pablo Diablo's Cryptic Triptych'', alongside ventriloquist Mark Felgate and Anglo-Iranian comic [[Shappi Khorsandi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://edinburgh.stv.tv/articles/242724-russell-brand-top-moments-in-edinburgh-ahead-of-usher-hall-show/ | title=Russell Brand top moments | publisher=Edinburgh.stv.tv | accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, he took his first one-man show, the confessional ''Better Now'', to the Edinburgh Festival, giving what he claimed was an honest account of his heroin addiction. He returned the following year with ''Eroticised Humour''. He launched his first nationwide tour, ''Shame'', in 2006. Brand drew on embarrassing incidents in his own life and the coverage about him in the tabloid press. The show was released on DVD as ''Russell Brand: Live''. Brand appeared in a sketch and performed stand-up at [[Amnesty International]]'s ''Secret Policeman's Ball'' in [[The Secret Policeman's Ball (2006)|2006]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvrpHqRJ9qk |title=Secret Policeman's Ball: Russell Brand 'Reading The Sun' |author=Amnesty International |publisher=YouTube|date=27 January 2012|accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again at the 2012 edition at Radio City Music Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/mar/05/secret-policemans-ball-review|title=Secret Policeman's Ball – review| newspaper = [[The Guardian]]|author=Laura Barton|date=5 March 2012|accessdate = 8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2007, he co-hosted an evening of the [[Teenage Cancer Trust]] gigs with [[Noel Fielding]]. In December 2007, Brand performed for Queen [[Elizabeth II]] and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]] as an act in the [[Royal Variety Performance|2007 Royal Variety Performance]]. His second nationwide tour, in 2007, was called ''Russell Brand: Only Joking'' and released on DVD as ''Russell Brand: Doin' Life''. Brand began performing in the US, and recorded a special for [[Comedy Central]] titled ''Russell Brand in New York'', which aired in March 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c21media.net/news/detail.asp?area=4&amp;article=47727 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100807164947/http://www.c21media.net/news/detail.asp?area=4&amp;article=47727 |dead-url=yes |archive-date= 7 August 2010 |title=Brand in first US comedy special |publisher=C21media.net |date=19 February 2009 |accessdate=31 May 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brand began touring the UK, America and Australia from January to {{Nowrap|April 2009}} on a tour called ''Russell Brand: Scandalous''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allgigs.co.uk/search/tourdates/52509/Russell_Brand-1.html |title=Russell Brand 2009 Tour Dates |publisher=Allgigs.co.uk |accessdate=31 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October, a further four dates that were performed in November were added to raise money for Focus 12, the drug charity for which Brand is a patron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.russellbrand.tv/2009/10/last-chance-to-see-the-scandalous-tour/ |title=Last Chance to see the Scandalous Tour |publisher=Russellbrand.tv |date=9 October 2009 |accessdate=31 May 2010 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/66bWz0ome?url=http://www.russellbrand.tv/2009/10/last-chance-to-see-the-scandalous-tour/ |archive-date=1 April 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Brand presented and toured his comedy show ''Messiah Complex'', in which he tackled advertising, the laws on drug addiction and the portrayal of his heroes, such as [[Gandhi]], [[Che Guevara|Guevara]], [[Malcolm X]] and [[Jesus]], and how he is, in comically contrived ways, similar to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/oct/09/russell-brand-birmingham-symphony-hall-review|title=Russell Brand: Messiah Complex – review|author=Brian Logan|newspaper=the Guardian|date=2013-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017 Brand announced his new show ''Re:Birth'' which will debut in April 2017 and will run until November 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2017/01/27/russell-brand-announces-that-he-is-going-on-a-uk-tour-and-its-called-the-rebirth-6410471/|title=Russell Brand announces that he is going on a UK tour and it's called the 'Re:Birth'|publisher=metro.com |date=13 February 2017 |accessdate=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Presenting===
Brand's first presenting role came in 2000 as a [[video journalist]] on [[MTV (UK and Ireland)|MTV]]. He presented ''[[Dancefloor Chart]]'', touring nightclubs in Britain and [[Ibiza]], and hosted the tea-time request show ''Select''. Brand was fired several days after coming to work dressed as [[Osama bin Laden]] the day after the [[September 11 attacks|11 September 2001 attacks]] and bringing his drug dealer to the MTV studios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/nov/13/biography.drugsandalcohol|title=And then I became a junkie ...&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; By genre&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; Guardian Unlimited Books|accessdate=18 November 2007|last=Brand|first=Russell|date=13 November 2007|work=The Guardian |location=UK }}&lt;/ref&gt;
After leaving MTV, Brand starred in ''[[RE:Brand]]'', a documentary and [[comedy television]] program that aimed to take a challenging look at cultural taboos. It was conceived, written, and hosted by Brand, with the help of his comic partner on many projects, [[Matt Morgan (comedian)|Matt Morgan]]. The series was shown on the now-defunct digital satellite channel [[UK Play]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ovguide.com/tv_season/rebrand-season-1-82361 | title=REBrand season 1 Full Episodes | publisher=www.ovguide.com | accessdate=18 December 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218111709/http://www.ovguide.com/tv_season/rebrand-season-1-82361 | archive-date=18 December 2014 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, he hosted ''[[List of Big Brother (UK) shows#Big Brother's Big Mouth|Big Brother's Eforum]]'' on [[E4 (TV channel)|E4]], a sister show to ''[[Big Brother 5 (UK)|Big Brother 5]]''. The show gave celebrity guests and the public the chance to have their say on the goings-on inside the ''Big Brother'' house. For ''[[Big Brother 6 (UK)|Big Brother 6]]'', the show's name changed to ''[[Big Brother's Big Mouth]]''. Following ''[[Celebrity Big Brother 5 (UK)|Celebrity Big Brother 5]]'', Brand said he would not return to host the ''[[Big Brother 8 (UK)|Big Brother 8]]'' series of ''Big Brother's Big Mouth''. In a statement, Brand thanked all the producers for "taking the risk of employing an ex-junkie twerp" to front the show. Of his time presenting the show, he said, "The three years I've spent on ''Big Brother's Big Mouth'' have been an unprecedented joy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6526833.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Entertainment - Brand quits Big Brother spin-off|work=bbc.co.uk|date=2007-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brand hosted a one-off special called ''Big Brother According to Russell Brand'', in which Brand took a surreal, sideways look at ''Big Brother'' through the ages. On 8 January 2008, Brand was the fifth celebrity to "hijack" the Big Brother house, in the E4 show ''[[Big Brother: Celebrity Hijack]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/bigbrothercelebrityhijack/a83754/russell-brand-speaks-to-the-house.html |title=Russell Brand speaks to the house |work=Digital Spy |location=UK |date=8 January 2008 |accessdate=31 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brand next returned to MTV in the spring of 2006 as presenter of the chat show, ''[[1 Leicester Square]]'', which had its broadcast time revised to allow for a more adult-oriented theme. Guests included [[Tom Cruise]], [[Uma Thurman]], [[The Mighty Boosh]], and [[Boy George]], and a second series began in September 2006 on MTV. After ''Big Brother 7'' finished, Brand presented a debate show called ''[[Russell Brand's Got Issues]]'', on E4. The viewing figures for the first episode were seen as disappointing, being beaten by nearly all of E4's main multi-channel rivals, despite a big publicity and promotional campaign for the show. The poor ratings prompted the network to repackage the show as ''[[The Russell Brand Show (TV series)|The Russell Brand Show]]'' and move it to [[Channel 4]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/programming/a39197/primetime-slots-for-comedians-hill-and-brand.html |title=Primetime slots for comedians Hill and Brand |work=Digital Spy |location=UK |date=9 November 2006 |accessdate=31 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first episode was broadcast on {{Nowrap|24 November}} on Channel 4,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6133116.stm |title=Brand and Ross to go head-to-head|work=BBC News | date=9 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it ran for five weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ovguide.com/tv/the_russell_brand_show.htm | title=Watch The Russell Brand Show | publisher=www.ovguide.com | accessdate=18 December 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218111713/http://www.ovguide.com/tv/the_russell_brand_show.htm | archive-date=18 December 2014 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brand presented the 2006 [[NME Awards]]. At the ceremony [[Bob Geldof]], who was accepting an award from Brand, said at the podium, "Russell Brand – what a cunt", to which Brand replied, "Really, it's no surprise [Geldof]'s such an expert on famine. He has, after all, been dining out on '[[I Don't Like Mondays]]' for 30 years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Barbara Ellen |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/jun/18/broadcasting.arts |title=Interview with Russell Brand |work=Guardian |date= 18 June 2006|accessdate=31 May 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brand hosted the [[2007 BRIT Awards]] and presented [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] with an "Outstanding Contribution to Music" award at the event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6205786.stm Russell Brand to host Brit Awards] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023060226/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6205786.stm |date=23 October 2007 }} at BBC News&lt;/ref&gt; He also hosted one hour of [[Comic Relief (charity)|Comic Relief]].

[[File:Russell Brand and Courtney Love.jpg|thumb|left|Brand speaking with [[Courtney Love]] in Los Angeles, 2008]]
On 12 December 2007, [[BBC Four]] aired ''Russell Brand On the Road'', a documentary presented by Brand and Matt Morgan about the writer [[Jack Kerouac]] and his novel ''[[On the Road]]''. Brand returned to Channel 4 to host ''[[Russell Brand's Ponderland]]'', in which he discussed topics like childhood and science through stand-up comedy. The show first aired on 22 October 2007 and continued for the next five nights. A second series began on 30 October 2008. The show ran for 12 episodes over the two series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/russell-brands-ponderland/episode-guide/series-1/ | title=Russell Brand's Ponderland | publisher=www.channel4.com | accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brand was later announced as the host of the 2008 [[MTV Video Music Awards]] (VMAs), which drew skepticism from the American media, as he was relatively unknown to the American public. Brand's appearance led to controversy for numerous reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/russell-brand/38433 |title=Russell Brand to host MTV Awards |work=NME |location=UK |date=24 July 2008 |accessdate=31 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said the night "marked the launch of a very new [[Britney Spears]] era", referring to it as "the resurrection of [Spears]".

===Writing===
Brand's first autobiography, ''[[My Booky Wook]]'', was released on 15 November 2007 and received favorable reviews.

The book was published on 16 October 2008, and also includes Brand interviewing Noel Gallagher, [[James Corden]], and [[David Baddiel]] about football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Russell's Brand of philosophy|url=http://www.thisistotalessex.co.uk/Russell-s-Brand-philosophy/story-12646805-detail/story.html|publisher=www.thisistotelessex.co.uk|accessdate=23 January 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130505090927/http://www.thisistotalessex.co.uk/Russell-s-Brand-philosophy/story-12646805-detail/story.html|archivedate=5 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2006 until 2009, Brand wrote a column for ''[[The Guardian]]'' that focused on [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] and the [[England national football team]]. A collection of the columns from 2006 and 2007 was released in a book entitled ''Irons in the Fire''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Russell Brand | title = Irons in the Fire | publisher = Hodder &amp; Stoughton | date=15 Nov 2007| isbn= 978-0340961360}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brand continues to write articles for ''The Guardian'' that offer his perspectives on current events and pop culture, including the deaths of [[Amy Winehouse]] and [[Robin Williams]]. Following the [[2011 London riots]], Brand wrote a column in which he criticized the government's response to the riots in Summer 2011 as a failure to address the root causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brand|first=Russell|title=Big Brother isn't watching you|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/aug/11/london-riots-davidcameron|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=11 August 2011|location=London|date=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brand made his children's book debut in November 2014 with ''Russell Brand's Trickster Tales: The Pied Piper of Hamelin''. It is the first installment of an intended series, featuring illustrations by [[Chris Riddell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Alexander|first1=Ella|title=Russell Brand launches children's books: The Pied Piper of women remakes The Pied Piper of Hamelin|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/russell-brand-launches-childrens-books-the-pied-piper-of-women-remakes-the-pied-piper-of-hamelin-9232103.html|publisher=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=12 October 2014|date=2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Guardian'', reviewer Lucy Mangan noted: "The on-Brand need to be noticed is there on every page, his unwillingness to get out of the way of the story tripping the reader up at every turn" and adding that Chris Riddell’s illustrations "give the book a beauty it does not deserve and a coherence the text does not deliver".&lt;ref name="Guardian 28 Nov 2014"&gt;{{cite news |last=Mangan |first=Lucy |title= Russell Brand and Neil Gaiman’s childhood reinventions |url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/nov/28/russell-brand-the-pied-piper-of-hamelin-neil-gaiman-the-sleeper-and-the-spindle| date=28 November 2014|newspaper=The Guardian |location=London|accessdate=12 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicholas Tucker]], in ''[[The Independent]]'', was even less impressed, noting the book's "wearingly offensive" language, and writing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Were it not for his celebrity, this book in manuscript would surely have been returned to its author by any publisher along perhaps with some kindly advice for seeking out an anger-management course. But Brand’s take on The Pied Piper of Hamelin is the first of a series of riffs on traditional fairy and folk tales. If they are all as bad as this one, British children’s books will have hit a new low.&lt;ref name="Independent 30 October 2014"&gt;{{cite news |last=Tucker |first=Nicholas |title= Trickster Tales.

His book ''[[Revolution (Russell Brand book)|Revolution]]'', in which Brand develops his earlier ideas, was published by [[Random House]] in October 2014 and received much publicity.

In September 2017 Brand published ''Recovery: Freedom from Our Addictions''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/17/help-simon-amstell-recovery-freedom-from-addictions-russell-brand-reviews|title=Help by Simon Amstell; Recovery: Freedom from Our Addictions by Russell Brand – review|last=Merritt|first=Stephanie|date=2017-09-17|work=The Observer|access-date=2017-10-08|language=en-GB|issn=0029-7712}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political activism==

===2009–2012: Early interventions===
In January 2009, Brand participated in a celebrity letter to ''[[The Independent]]''—as a supporter of the Hoping Foundation—to condemn Israel's assault on [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]], and the "cruel and massive loss of life of the citizens of Gaza".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = We demand an end to the carnage in Gaza | newspaper=Independent | date = 9 January 2009 | url =https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/letters/letters-carnage-in-gaza-1242494.html | location=London | accessdate=23 May 2010 | postscript =&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2009, Brand and several other entertainers wrote to ''[[The Times]]'' in defense of [[Bahá'í]] leaders, who were on trial in [[Iran]] at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Stand up for Iran's Baha'is – Voices from the arts call for the imprisoned Baha'i leaders in Iran to receive a fair trial | newspaper=The Times | date = 26 February 2009 | url =http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/letters/article5804284.ece | location=London | accessdate=23 May 2010 | postscript =&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2009, he attended the [[2009 G-20 London summit protests]] and spoke to the press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Carroll |first=Isabelle |url=http://www.brandish.tv/2009/04/01/russell-brand-g20-summit-jefferson-hack.html |title=Brandish:Out and About |publisher=Brandish.tv |date=1 April 2009 |accessdate=31 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brand was selected by the [[Dalai Lama]] to host the Buddhist leader's 2012 youth event in [[Manchester]]. The Dalai Lama's representatives explained that Brand was selected because he had proved "the power of spirituality to effect change in his own life", while Brand stated to the BBC after the event: "I said yes because he's the living incarnation of Buddha and I thought, if you're around the Dalai Lama, that can only be good for your spiritual quest through life. He's an amazing diplomat, an incredible activist, a wonderful human being and an inspiration to us all."&lt;ref name="DalaiLama"&gt;{{cite news|last=Youngs|first=Ian|title=Russell Brand discusses the Dalai Lama|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-18455362|publisher=BBC|accessdate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012, Brand testified in front of a parliamentary committee about drug addiction, sharing his experiences and view that drugs should be decriminalised. He said, "I'm not a legal expert. I'm saying that, to a drug addict, the legal aspect is irrelevant. If you need to get drugs, you will. The criminal and legal status, I think, sends the wrong message. Being arrested isn't a lesson, it's just an administrative blip."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/russell-brand-testifies-before-a-parliamentary-committee-about-drug-addiction |title=Russell Brand testifies before a parliamentary committee about drug addiction|agency=Associated Press |publisher=[[CBS News]] |date=24 April 2012|accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of this testimony was included in a BBC Three documentary, ''Russell Brand: From Addiction to Recovery'', that aired in December 2012. Brand said he felt compelled to make the film after the 2011 death of close friend [[Amy Winehouse]], and he used the opportunity to also question how British society "deals with addicts and addiction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Russell Brand: From Addiction to Recovery|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00wq21g|publisher=BBC|accessdate=18 December 2014|date=9 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013, Brand appeared in a video in support of [[Chelsea Manning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2013/06/celebrity-bradley-manning-video-93041.html#ixzz2WgfpNmys |title=Celeb video: 'I am Bradley Manning' - Patrick Gavin |publisher=Politico.Com |date=20 June 2013 |accessdate=30 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Russell Brand Fire Brigades Union interview 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Brand interviewed at the anti-austerity rally in London, June 2014]]
Since 2013, Brand has appeared more frequently as a campaigner for serious issues rather than an entertainer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24648651|title=Russell Brand: 'I've never voted, never will'|work=BBC News|date=23 October 2013|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/30034120|title=Russell Brand 'worst political celebrity'|work=BBC News|date=13 November 2014|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 October 2013, Brand was interviewed by [[Jeremy Paxman]] for the BBC's ''[[Newsnight]]'' and was challenged about his call for "revolution" and whether someone who had never voted could edit a political magazine.&lt;!-- BBC Newsnight's official YouTube channel cited. --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YR4CseY9pk |title=NEWSNIGHT: Paxman vs Brand - full interview |publisher=BBC Newsnight/youtube.com |date=23 October 2013 |accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the issue of the ''[[New Statesman]]'', published on 24 October 2013, Brand's essay explained his objection to the destruction of earth through greed and exploitation, and called for a change in consciousness to accompany political and economic measures to achieve a more sustainable future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=New Statesman|title=Russell Brand on revolution: "We no longer have the luxury of tradition"|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2013/10/russell-brand-on-revolution |first=Russell|last=Brand|date=24 October 2013|accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nick Cohen]] in ''The Guardian'' commented about Brand: "He writes as if he is a precocious prepubescent rather than an adolescent: a child, born after the millennium, who can behave as if we never lived through the 20th century."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Nick Cohen |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/26/russell-brand-needs-more-than-wild-emotions |title=Wild emotions are all very well, Russell Brand, but then what?|work=[[The Guardian]] |date=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jeremy Paxman]] interviewed Brand on ''[[Newsnight]]'' in 2013, in which he disparaged the British political system as ineffectual and encouraged the British electorate not to vote.&lt;ref name=BBC1&gt;{{cite web|title=Russell Brand: 'I've never voted, never will'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24648651|website=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=5 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked by Paxman what a revolution would look like, Brand replied:
{{quote|A socialist egalitarian system based on the massive redistribution of wealth, [with] heavy taxation of corporations...I think the very concept of profit should be hugely reduced...I say profit is a filthy word, because wherever there is a profit there is also a deficit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Russell Brand With Jeremy Paxman On Newsnight|url=http://www.newlistener.co.uk/home/russell-brand-with-jeremy-paxman-on-newsnight/|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Russell Brand Attacks Capitalism|url=https://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/socialist-standard/2010s/2013/no-1312-december-2013/russell-brand-attacks-capitalism|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

British commentator [[Joan Smith]] dismissed Brand as the "canny self-publicist" who indulges in "waffle about 'revolution'" as "one celebrity, I'm afraid, who's more idiot than savant."&lt;ref&gt;Joan Smith [https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/joan-smith-spare-us-the-vacuous-talk-and-go-back-to-hollywood-8906305.html "Spare us the vacuous talk and go back to Hollywood "] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160410162003/http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/joan-smith-spare-us-the-vacuous-talk-and-go-back-to-hollywood-8906305.html |date=10 April 2016 }}, ''The Independent on Sunday'', 27 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Former ''[[The Independent|Independent]]'' editor [[Simon Kelner]] largely defended his appearance on ''Newsnight'': "It sounded rather attractive, even if it wasn't exactly worked through.

The unelected powerful, because you’re emotionally and psychologically disempowering politicians. The only power politicians have is the collective confidence we have in them. The most radical thing is to recapture the idea you can change the world."&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Trilling [https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/4641/fail-better "Fail Better"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160111141656/https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/4641/fail-better |date=11 January 2016 }}, ''New Humanist'', 24 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===2014–2015: ''The Trews'', ''Revolution'' and political activism===
In January 2014, Brand was invited by the [[Cambridge Union Society]] to participate in an interview, held in the Union's debating chamber with Leo Kirby, the Union's 2014 [[Cambridge Union Society#Elected officers|Speakers' Officer]]. The interview ran for more than an hour and was published on the Union's YouTube channel.&lt;ref name="Cam"&gt;{{cite web|title=Russell Brand at the Cambridge Union Society|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtOR__vtzXA|work=The Cambridge Union Society on YouTube|accessdate=8 April 2014|date=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brand launched his YouTube series ''[[The Trews (Russell Brand)|The Trews: True News with Russell Brand]]'' on 27 February 2014, in which he "analyses the news, truthfully, spontaneously and with great risk to his personal freedom." In addition to news analysis, he regularly has guests on the show, including economists, journalists and activists. By the end of the year, more than 200 episodes had been released on the channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dj_Cp-xr-w |title=What Will Make Politicians Take Notice?

In June 2014, he took part in the [[People's Assembly Against Austerity]], that attracted an estimated 50,000 people marching from the BBC office to [[Westminster]]. Brand addressed the crowd, saying, "The people of this building [the House of Commons] generally speaking do not represent us, they represent their friends in big business. It's time for us to take back our power. Power isn't there, it is here, within us. The revolution that's required isn't a revolution of radical ideas, but the implementation of ideas we already have."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jun/21/protest-march-austerity-london-russell-brand-peoples-assembly|title=Tens of thousands march in London against coalition's austerity measures |work=[[The Guardian]] |author=Kevin Rawlinson|date=21 June 2014|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, Brand lent his support to the [[Fire Brigades Union]], giving a speech at the union's rally against cuts in London and asking the public to support the firefighters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/showbiz/515727/Russell-Brand-calls-for-firefighters-support |title=Russell Brand calls for firefighters support|date=26 September 2014|accessdate=26 January 2015|work=The Express}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2014, at the time Brand's book ''Revolution'' was published, [[John Lydon]] (also known as "Johnny Rotten" of the [[Sex Pistols]]), in an interview with [[Polly Toynbee]] of ''The Guardian'', said that Brand's advocacy of non-voting is "the most idiotic thing I’ve ever heard."&lt;ref name="Toynbee"&gt;Polly Toynbee [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/15/johnny-rotten-lydon-russell-brand-revolution-vote "Johnny Rotten and I agree: neither of us wants Russell Brand’s ‘revolution’"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160926025542/http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/15/johnny-rotten-lydon-russell-brand-revolution-vote |date=26 September 2016 }}, ''The Guardian'', 15 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In a November 2014 [[YouGov]] poll, involving a selection of celebrities, Brand was chosen as the one with the most negative influence on political debate (46%). The poll also found that 60% of poll participants disliked him and 28% liked him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dahlgreen|first1=Will|title=British public revolt against Russell Brand|url=https://yougov.co.uk/news/2014/11/12/public-revolt-russell-brand/|accessdate=23 November 2014|publisher=[[YouGov]]|date=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly afterward, Brand appeared on ''Newsnight'' again, but was interviewed by [[Evan Davis]] on this occasion. Asked about [[9/11 conspiracy theories]] and whether the attacks were perpetuated by the American government, Brand commented: "[w]e have to remain open-minded to [that] kind of possibility",&lt;ref&gt;Jenn Selby [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/russell-brand-admits-hes-open-minded-to-911-conspiracy-theories-in-combative-newsnight-interview-with-evan-davis-9815531.html "Russell Brand admits he's 'open minded' about 9/11 conspiracy theories in ''Newsnight'' interview with Evan Davis"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150718093152/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/russell-brand-admits-hes-open-minded-to-911-conspiracy-theories-in-combative-newsnight-interview-with-evan-davis-9815531.html |date=18 July 2015 }}, ''The Independent'', 24 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqsFp0J22Hc&amp;list=UU6o-wWU-v2ClFMwougmK7dA "'I don't trust politicians &amp; corporations in this country' Russell Brand - Newsnight"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160410162339/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqsFp0J22Hc&amp;list=UU6o-wWU-v2ClFMwougmK7dA |date=10 April 2016 }}, YouTube (BBC Newsnight Feed), 24 October 2014.

[[File:Russell Brand London Revolution Protest.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Brand at the [[People's Assembly Against Austerity]] rally in June 2014]]
BBC Three commissioned Brand to make a documentary on the global "[[War on Drugs]]", which aired on 26 November 2014. The film, titled ''Russell Brand: End the Drugs War'', shows him exploring the illicit drug policies of other countries in search of a compassionate approach to people who use illicit drugs. Brand explains in the documentary, "People think compassion is 'wet liberalism'; it's not, it's pragmatic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Russell Brand: End the Drugs War|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02ctrgl|website=BBC Three|publisher=BBC|accessdate=18 December 2014|date=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brand worked with the Matchlight Ltd production company, director Ross Wilson and executive producer Liz Hartford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Russell Brand: End the Drugs War|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04v2zrg|website=BBC Three|publisher=BBC|accessdate=18 December 2014|date=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that month, on 11 December, Brand appeared on the BBC's ''[[Question Time (TV series)|Question Time]]'' programme which included the [[UK Independence Party]]'s leader [[Nigel Farage]] as one of the other panellists.

In March 2015, readers of ''[[Prospect (magazine)|Prospect]]'' magazine voted Brand the fourth-most influential thinker in the world, behind [[Thomas Piketty]], [[Yanis Varoufakis]], and [[Naomi Klein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Russell Brand Voted 4th Most Influential Thinker In The World|url=http://www.inquisitr.com/1958316/russell-brand-voted-4th-most-influential-thinker-in-the-world/|accessdate=28 March 2015|work=Inquisitr News|date=27 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brand and director [[Michael Winterbottom]] worked together to produce a documentary, ''[[The Emperor's New Clothes (2015 film)|The Emperor's New Clothes]]'', that had its international premiere on 24 April 2015 at the [[Tribeca Film Festival]].

On 20 August 2015, Brand released episode 366 of ''The Trews'' titled "Final Episode Of The Trews - Goodbye, Good Luck", which he said would be the final episode of the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvoqQT41wos|title=Final Episode Of The Trews - Goodbye, Good Luck: Russell Brand The Trews (E366)|publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=20 August 2015|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Trews returned on 12 October 2016.

In August 2015, Brand endorsed [[Jeremy Corbyn]]'s [[Jeremy Corbyn Labour Party leadership campaign, 2015|campaign]] in the [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 2015|Labour Party leadership election]]. He said: "Jeremy Corbyn would be a better kind of new Labour.

He wrote: "Whether it's the [[Iraq War]] or [[badger-baiting]], Corbyn has been allied with common sense and compassion in pretty much every Parliamentary argument." He praised Corbyn for his long record of sticking to his principles and for standing up to the media's treatment of him. Regarding the 2015 election he said: "You know I never actually said 'don't vote? I said 'There's no point in voting when the main political parties are basically indistinguishable and the relationship between government, big business and factions of the media make it impossible for the democratic will of the people to be realised, which is a more nuanced point and plainly true. Anyway, that was then and this is now."&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost"&gt;{{cite news |last=Brand|first=Russell|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/russell-brand/russell-brand-blog-jeremy-corbyn-theresa-may_b_16892508.html?1496239073|title=Jeremy Corbyn Won’t Be Perfect, But He Has The Qualities I Want In A Strong And Stable Leader|work= |location= |publisher=''[[The Huffington Post]]''|date=31 May 2017|accessdate=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2015-2018===
As of 2018, Brand was podcasting interviews with thinkers such as [[Yuval Noah Harari]] (13/10/18).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.russellbrand.com/podcasts/ | title=Podcasts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
On 16 September 2010, Brand was arrested on suspected battery charges after he allegedly attacked a [[paparazzi|paparazzo]] who blocked his and then-fiancée Katy Perry's way to catch a flight at [[Los Angeles International Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://movies.ndtv.com/movie_story.aspx?Section=Movies&amp;ID=ENTEN20100153641&amp;subcatg=MOVIESINDIA&amp;keyword=hollywood&amp;nid=53018 |title="Russell Brand arrested after scuffle with paparazzi" - Press Trust of India |publisher=Movies.ndtv.com |date=18 September 2010 |accessdate=17 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917004843/http://movies.ndtv.com/movie_story.aspx?Section=Movies&amp;ID=ENTEN20100153641&amp;subcatg=MOVIESINDIA&amp;keyword=hollywood&amp;nid=53018 |archivedate=17 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The paparazzo placed Brand under [[Citizen's arrest in the United States|citizen's arrest]] until the police arrived and he was released from custody the next day after posting US$20,000 bail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Russell Brand arrested after airport altercation|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/russell-brand-arrested-after-airport-altercation-2082892.html|accessdate=8 April 2014|newspaper=The Independent|date=18 September 2010|author=Associated Press|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 March 2012, an arrest warrant was issued for Brand in [[New Orleans]], U.S., because of allegations that he had thrown a photographer's mobile phone through a window. The paparazzo was taking pictures of Brand with an [[iPhone]] when Brand wrestled the device from his hands and tossed it at a law firm's window. The warrant cited "simple criminal damage to property", leading Brand, who offered to pay for the replacement of the window, to voluntarily appear at a police station. Brand was filming a movie in New Orleans at the time of the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Russell Brand arrested for damage done in iPhone snatch-and-hurl|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/gossip/2012/03/russell-brand-arrested-paparazzi-iphone-new-orleans.html|accessdate=13 December 2013|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=15 March 2012|author=Christie D'Zurilla}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brand was ejected from the ''[[GQ]]'' Awards show on 3 September 2013 after receiving the "Oracle" award. In his acceptance speech, he mentioned sponsor [[Hugo Boss]]' former business making uniforms for the Nazi regime. Brand said, "They [Nazis] did look fucking fantastic, let's face it" before he goose stepped across the stage in a comical imitation of the Nazi march. Brand was eventually ejected from the event after ''GQ'' editor Dylan Jones confronted Brand with his view that the speech was "very offensive"—Brand replied by saying that the Nazis' treatment of the Jewish people was "very offensive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Marina Hyde|title=GQ award-winner Charles Moore cracks Russell Brand's 'Nazi' comment|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2013/sep/05/russell-brand-nazi-hugo-boss-charles-moore|accessdate=18 December 2014|work=The Guardian|date=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hyde|first=Marina|title=GQ award-winner Charles Moore cracks Russell Brand's 'Nazi' comment|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2013/sep/05/russell-brand-nazi-hugo-boss-charles-moore|accessdate=14 September 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oracle"&gt;{{cite news|title=Russell Brand and the GQ awards: 'It's amazing how absurd it seems'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/sep/13/russell-brand-gq-awards-hugo-boss |accessdate=16 September 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=13 September 2013|author=Russell Brand}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brand was later given the opportunity to reflect on the award night on the ''Guardian'' website:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Now I'm aware that this [''GQ'' award speech] was really no big deal ... It was a daft joke by a daft comic at a daft event. It makes me wonder, though, how the relationships and power dynamics I witnessed on this relatively inconsequential context are replicated on a more significant scale ... Ought we be concerned that our rights to protest are being continually eroded under the guise of enhancing our safety? ... When you take a breath and look away from the spectacle it's amazing how absurd it seems when you look back.&lt;ref name="Oracle" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In June 2015, the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' revealed that Brand was selling sweatshirts stated to be British-made, while they were in fact made in Bangladesh by workers earning under US$1 per hour. He said that he was unaware of this, and had terminated his relationship with the manufacturer as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Russell Brand drops sweater supplier amid row|url=http://www.u.tv/Entertainment/2015/06/06/Russell-Brand-drops-sweater-supplier-amid-row-38573|accessdate=8 June 2015|publisher=UTV|date=6 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610020843/http://www.u.tv/Entertainment/2015/06/06/Russell-Brand-drops-sweater-supplier-amid-row-38573|archivedate=10 June 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

I was really, really in love with her, but it was difficult to see each other ... it mostly didn't work for practical reasons."&lt;ref name="mtvstern"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1689887/russell-brand-katy-perry-divorce-howard-stern |title=Russell Brand Opens Up About Katy Perry Divorce |publisher=[[MTV]] |author=Gil Kaufman |date=18 July 2012|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Stern pressed for details, Brand declined, saying, "I don't want anything to hurt her. She’s younger than me, she’s a young woman and she’s beautiful and she’s sensitive and I care about her deeply."&lt;ref name="mtvstern" /&gt; Brand, who married Perry without a [[prenuptial agreement]], was eligible to claim half of the estimated $44 million she earned during their marriage, but declined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-life/russell-brand-says-no-to-katy-perrys-fortune-in-amicable-divorce/story-fn907478-1226266542490 |title=Russell Brand says no to Katy Perry's $44 million fortune in 'amicable' divorce|work=News.com.au|date=9 February 2012|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2013 to 2014, Brand was in a relationship with [[Jemima Khan]], an editor of the ''New Statesman'', and a daughter of financier [[Sir James Goldsmith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Russell Brand IS dating Jemima Khan|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/10313310/Russell-Brand-IS-dating-Jemima-Khan.html|accessdate=8 April 2014|newspaper=[[Daily Telegraph]]|date=16 September 2013|author=Rhiannon Williams|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2014, Brand received libel damages from [[The Sun (United Kingdom)|''The Sun'']] following a story the paper had printed in November 2013 alleging that he had [[infidelity|cheated]] on Khan. Brand said he would be donating the unspecified damages to the [[Justice for the 96|Hillsborough Justice Campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-27325587 | title=Russell Brand accepts damages from Sun on Sunday | publisher=BBC News | date=8 May 2014 | accessdate=9 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brand and Khan ended their relationship in September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20141029091943/http://www.independent.ie/style/celebrity/celebrity-news/its-over-russell-brand-and-jemima-khan-split-30603157.html "It's over: Russell Brand and Jemima Khan split"], ''The Independent'' (Eire), 21 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eizabeth Beynon [https://web.archive.org/web/20141029114408/http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/People/article1462150.ece "No Khan do: Jemima and Russell Brand ‘split after a year’"], ''The Sunday Times'', 21 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In the October 2014 issue of ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', Brand said of the allegations of misogyny made against him: "I have lived a life and had a frame of cultural references that make that charge quite legitimate... But as a person who’s trying to live a decent, spiritual life, misogyny is not part of my current palette of behaviors... In a way, redemption is a great part of my narrative. I’m talking about disavowing previous lives, previous beliefs, previous behaviours."&lt;ref name="Kamp"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/vf-hollywood/2014/10/russell-brand-interview-revolution |title=Russell Brand, Seriously|author=David Kamp |work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |date=29 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2015, Brand has been in a relationship with Scottish lifestyle blogger Laura Gallacher, whom he had dated off and on since 2007. Gallacher is the sister of television presenter [[Kirsty Gallacher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Juneau|first1=Jen|title=It’s a Girl!

===Substance use===
[[File:Russell Brand.jpg|thumb|upright|Brand in March 2008]]
The media published articles on Brand during his drug-using period, typically in relation to incidents, and his public profile has since been associated with this era. Drug-related issues led to Brand's arrest on 12 occasions.&lt;ref name=BarbaraEllenInterview&gt;{{cite news|last=Ellen|first=Barbara|title=Interview with Russell Brand|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/jun/18/broadcasting.arts|publisher=The Observer|accessdate=18 June 2006|location=London|date=18 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brand was ejected from [[the Gilded Balloon]] in Edinburgh, Scotland and following a subsequent show in the city in 2004, a reviewer stated that "you'd rather hug him than hit him", as he had embraced recovery by this point. Following the cessation of his use, Brand revealed through his stand-up performances that he introduced his drug dealer to [[Kylie Minogue]] during his time at MTV&lt;ref name=TimeOut&gt;{{cite web|last=Brand|first=Russell|title=Russell Brand on Heroin|url=http://www.au.timeout.com/sydney/books/features/4329/russell-brand-on-heroin|publisher=Time Out Sydney|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714181622/http://www.au.timeout.com/sydney/books/features/4329/russell-brand-on-heroin|archivedate=14 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and masturbated a stranger in a public toilet for a television programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaite.com/tv/russell-brand-did-what-in-a-public-bathroom-when-he-was-a-crack-and-heroin-addict/|title=Russell Brand Did What In A Public Bathroom When He Was A Crack And Heroin Addict?|work=[[Mediaite]]|last=Wilstein|first=Matt|date=11 June 2013|accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2014, Brand described his first experience with heroin as "blissful".&lt;ref name="Cam" /&gt;

Brand has abstained from drug use since 13 December 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://twitter.com/rustyrockets/status/543780258965889024 |title=Today I am 12 years clean from drugs&amp;alcohol |author=Russell Brand|publisher=[[Twitter]]|date=13 December 2014|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a patron of the Focus 12 drug treatment programme after his own use of the service. Brand's sobriety was instigated by his agent, [[John Noel (producer)|John Noel]], after Brand was apprehended using heroin in a bathroom during a Christmas party. Brand cites his practice of [[transcendental meditation]] as a significant factor in his recovery from drug dependence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Look Who's Meditating Now|date=20 March 2011|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/20/fashion/20TM.html|first=Irina|last=Aleksander}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brand organised three fundraisers for Focus 12 in London, Dublin and Belfast in 2009, and has also acted as a "[[Twelve-step program#Sponsorship|sponsor]]" for numerous people during the rehabilitation stage of their treatment process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Russell Brand|url=http://www.focus12.co.uk/russell-brand/|work=Focus 12|publisher=Focus 12|accessdate=8 April 2014|year=2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307115259/http://www.focus12.co.uk/russell-brand|archivedate=7 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sexual rituals''' fall into two categories: [[culture]]-created, and natural behaviour, the human animal having developed ''[[Human sexual behavior|sex]] rituals'' from evolutionary instincts for [[reproduction]], which are then integrated into [[society]], and elaborated to include aspects such as marriage rites, dances, etc. Arguably indeed, 'sex in its more ritualized and symbolic varieties...has moulded the shape of civilization'.&lt;ref&gt;Desmond Morris, ''The Naked Ape Trilogy'' (London 1994) p. 246 and p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes sexual rituals are highly formalized and/or part of religious activity, as in the cases of [[Hieros gamos]], the [[hierodule]] and the [[Ordo Templi Orientis|OTO]]. Contemporary sacred sexual rituals have been tagged as 'structured, symbolic, manifestation, ceremonies, tradition, everyday, habit, grounding, magic, solemn'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://boston.sexspirit.net/ss-rituals-script.pdf "Sacred Sexual Rituals" p. 3] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225001208/http://boston.sexspirit.net/ss-rituals-script.pdf |date=2010-12-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rites of passage==

Part of the [[rites of passage]] of growing up are what have been termed 'rites of separation from the asexual world...followed by rites of incorporation into the world of sexuality'.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold van Gennep, ''The Rites of Passage'' (1977) p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; These may be formal or semi-formal—'for some students, going to college is partly a sexual ritual, like the ceremonial dances of the [[whooping crane]]'&lt;ref&gt;Northrop Frue et al, ''Northrop Frye's Writing on Education'' (2000) p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;—or take the form of a more private induction: 'formal and artificial...the impression that a long-established rite was to be enacted, among Staffordshire figurs and ''papier-mâché'' trays, with the compelling, detached formality of nightmare'.&lt;ref&gt;Antony Powell, ''A Buyer's Market'' (1981 )p. 267-8&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Freud]] was particularly interested in [[Ethnological]] accounts of 'the "ceremonial" (purely formal, ritual, or official) [[coitus]], which takes place' in connection with 'the [[taboo]] of virginity'.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Sexuality'' (PFL 7) p. 268-9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wedding as orgy===

Freud also noted that in 'numerous examples of marriage ceremonies there can be no doubt that people other than the bridegroom, for example his assistants and companions (our traditional "groomsmen"),  granted full sexual access to the bride'.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Sexuality'' p. 269n&lt;/ref&gt; To his followers, 'the ''wedding as orgy'', with the bride taking on all the men present, is the clear historical reality behind the modern jokes...and the climactic line-up or "gang"-kissing of the bride, by all the men present'.&lt;ref&gt;G. Legman, ''The Rationale of the Dirty Joke'' Vol II (1973) p. 90-2&lt;/ref&gt;

In such a view, 'other examples of sacred or permitted public coitus of all women with all men do survive, in similarly modified "kissing" form', as under the [[Mistletoe#Culture, folklore, and mythology|mistletoe]] 'to revive the dying sun at the winter solstice, when the strongest human "life-magic", namely ritual intercourse, is to be deployed'.&lt;ref&gt;Legman, ''Rationale'' p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interaction ritual==

To the [[sociologist]] looking upon 'sexual intercourse as interaction ritual...sexual intercourse is the ritual of love; it both creates and recreates the social tie (since [[Durkheim]]ian rituals need to be repeated periodically, as solidarity runs down), and symbolizes it'.&lt;ref&gt;Randall Collins, ''Interaction Ritual Chains'' (Princeton 2004) p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; In similar fashion, [[Margot Anand]] has pointed out that 'rituals pervade our daily life and give it a sense of ceremony and celebration(...)a ritual, through your own unique symbolic gestures...will help you transform your lovemaking into a special and sacred act'.&lt;ref&gt;Margo Anand, ''The Art of Sexual Ecstasy'' (1990) p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Erving Goffman]] has noted however 'the considerable informational delicacy of this form of interaction', and how 'individuals may use darkness to ensure strategic ambiguity'.&lt;ref&gt;Erving Goffman, ''Relations in Public'' (Penguin 1972) p. 235&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compulsions==

In [[perversion]], sexual rituals may emerge as a necessary part of sexual activity. For the [[criminologist]], 'sexual ritual involves repeatedly engaging in an act or series of acts in a certain manner because of a sexual need'.&lt;ref&gt;J. E. Douglas et al, ''Crime Classification Manual'' (2006) p. 296&lt;/ref&gt; Within a relationship, 'the Compulsive [[libido]] type takes advantages of opportunities to use the specific sexual ritual that causes intense arousal, and in its stronger form, the Compulsive lover can only arouse using the sexual object or ritual''.&lt;ref&gt;Sandra Pertot, ''When Your Sex Drives Don't Match'' (2007) p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

In any relationship however, 'a sexual habit that becomes routine or stylised...can lead to a sexual ritual', so that 'if you don't have a way to talk to your partner about your sexual relationship, you may find yourself...stuck in sexual rituals that could be limiting your sexual enjoyment':&lt;ref&gt;G. Anderson/B. K. Weinhold, ''Connective Bargaining'' (1981) p. 53 and p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; as a wife might say, '"Same old technique, same old Lewis. It's you all right, I'd know that old routine anywhere'.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Stewart, ''Airs Above the Ground'' (1967) p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; Thus one's sex life may all 'be about rituals: the ritual of sex in the morning, or the ritual of sex at night; and the ritual of sex at anniversaries, and the ritual of sex at Christmas'.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''Sex in Human Loving'' (1970) p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tibetan art==
In the [[Tibetan art|Buddhist art]] of [[India]], [[Bhutan]], [[Nepal]] and [[Tibet]], [[yab-yum]] is the male [[deity]] in sexual union with his female [[wikt:consort|consort]]. The symbolism is associated with [[Anuttarayoga tantra]] where the male figure is usually linked to compassion (''{{IAST|karuṇā}}'') and skillful means (''[[upaya|upāya-kauśalya]]''), and the female partner to 'insight' (''prajñā'').&lt;ref&gt;Keown, Damien. (2003). ''A Dictionary of Buddhism'',  p. 338. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-860560-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The symbolism of union and sexual polarity is a central teaching in [[Tantric Buddhism]], especially in Tibet. The union is realised by the practitioner as a mystical experience within one's own body.&lt;ref&gt;Herrmann-Pfandt, Adelheid. "Yab Yum Iconography and the Role of Women in Tibetan Tantric Buddhism." ''The Tibet Journal''. Vol. XXII, No. 1. Spring 1997, pp. 12-34.&lt;/ref&gt; Yab-yum is generally understood to represent the primordial (or mystical) union of wisdom and compassion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seriousseekers.com/News%20and%20Articles/pallis_marriagewisdommethod.pdf The Marriage of Wisdom and Method] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617051023/http://www.seriousseekers.com/News%20and%20Articles/pallis_marriagewisdommethod.pdf |date=2011-06-17 }} By Marco Pallis&lt;/ref&gt;

Tantric Buddhism is itself an outcrop of [[Tantra|Tantrism]], advanced techniques of which included 'the ritual sex act ([[Maithuna]]) which was a feature of Tantric yoga'.&lt;ref&gt;Sophie Hoare, ''Yoga'' (London 1977) p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Given that 'sex is holy to a Tantric...Tantric art, writings and religious rituals glorify sex'.&lt;ref&gt;K. Devi, in Margo Anand, ''The Art of Sexual Ecstasy'' (1990) p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

==Private worship==

A sex organ 'makes an admirable fertility symbol, and has been worshipped as such privately from time to time, or even publicly...gives dramatic promise of productivity and protection'.&lt;ref&gt;Berne, p. 78-80&lt;/ref&gt; Such "worship" may only become more common in [[late modernity]], as 'in our secular culture sexuality often replaces religion as a means of pursuing the meaning of life'.&lt;ref&gt;Gail Sheehy, ''New Passages'' (London 1996) p. 328-9&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alan Watts]] maintains that 'when you are [[falling in love|in love]] with someone, you do indeed see them as a divine being...through a tremendous outpouring of psychic energy in total devotion and worship for this other person'.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, in Anand, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; A woman may 'want someone who adores me...like he was adoring my breasts with his hands'.&lt;ref&gt;Kate Cann, ''Sea Change'' (London 2007) p. 48 and p. 297&lt;/ref&gt; A man (more ambivalently) may muse on 'the white breasts he worships; adores; is scared of; detests'.&lt;ref&gt;Sean Thomas, ''the cheek perforation dance'' (London 2003) p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Shakespeare]], 'this is the liver-vein, which makes flesh a deity, a green goose a goddess; pure, pure idolatry'.&lt;ref&gt;G. Blakemore Evans ed., ''The Riverside Shakespeare'' (1997) p. 229&lt;/ref&gt;

In the further reaches of [[chick lit]], ' the male organ...becomes a tower of strength, a tree trunk in girth, the pillar that sustains the universe...a Pillar of Hercules, sustaining heaven'&lt;ref&gt;Amanda Hemingway, ''Soulfire'' (London 1994) p. 277 and p. 437&lt;/ref&gt;—evidence perhaps that 'the phallic religious tendency is alive in the modern and the civilized...a compulsive fascination'&lt;ref&gt;C. R. Aldrich, ''The Primitive Mind and Modern Civilization'' (1999) p. 153 and p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; with what [[Jung]] termed 'the phallus as the quintessence of life and fruitfulness'.&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''Psychology of the Unconscious'' 9London 1944) p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; Correspondingly, the Western adept may borrow, in the quest 'to create a Sacred Space...names given to the vagina in the East, including Valley of Joy, Great Jewel, Pearl, Lotus Blossom, Moist Cave, Ripe Peach, Enchanted Garden, and Full Moon'.&lt;ref&gt;Anand, p. 72 and p. 215&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==

In the ''[[Satyricon]]'', the hero is throughout 'hounded by the mighty rage of [[Priapus]] of Hellespont'—almost certainly because early on he 'has offended Priapus...by impersonating him in some sexual ceremonies'.&lt;ref&gt;Petronius, ''The Satyricon'' (Penguin 1986) p. 157 and p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Hinduism small}}
'''Shashti Poorti''' is a Sanskrit word meaning completion of sixty. Also known also as "Shashti Abda Poorti" or "Ugraratha Santi" or மணி விழா (mani vizha)) is a [[Hindu]] ceremony celebrating the 60th birthday of a male, akin to the [[Wedding vow renewal ceremony|renewal of marital vows]].

==Etymology==
Shashti Poorti is celebrated on completion of 60 years of age of the male. This term is derived from Sanskrit in which Shashti means sixty; abda–year; poorthi-completion. It marks completion of half the years of one's lifetime as in [[Hinduism]], 120 years is considered the life span of a human being. The sixtieth year in one’s life is a significant milestone, memorable turning point, a touching reminder of the rich, mellowed life that would unfold in the years to come. In fact, the [[Hindu calendar]] has 60 years (named Prabhava, Vibhava, etc.) that repeat themselves after every 60 years in a sequence. Shashti poorthi marks the completion of one such cycle. For example, a person born in the year Pramodoota and has lived for 60 years will have seen all the 60 years in the calendar. This milestone marks celebration and gratitude for life given by God. So once his birthday arrives in Pramodootha year, he performs his Shashti poorthi. In recent days, children started doing this ritual to their parents, just as their parents performed all of their rituals in their childhood.

One more important aspect of Shashtiabdha poorthi is that all the planets in the zodiac come to the same positions or occupy the same houses of zodiac as compared to the actual date of birth of the individual. These planets take the same position as they were on the date of birth of the individual after 60 years. That is why the Celebration is performed on the same lunar day when the moon conjoins the birth star of the individual on the same month and the same year in which he was born.

The veda says "Janmaabde, Janmamaasecha Swajanmadivase tathaa, Janmarshe chaiva kartavyaa santi rugrarathaahvayaa, Devaalaye nadeeteere swagruhe vaa subhasthale."

The sages and the [[rishis]] of lore have acknowledged the sanctity of the sixtieth year in one’s life and have drawn out elaborate rituals to mark this special event. They looked at it as rebirth and suggested the repetition of those rituals performed at one’s birth. Hence this celebration at this point of life is a sacred part of the hallowed [[Vedic]] culture.

The Shastipoorti Santi should be performed in the sixty first year and in the same month and day of birth according to the Indian Zodiac. This is considered to be the best option. In case it is not possible to time it exactly on the same day, allowance is given to perform it on a convenient day during and before the completion of sixtieth year. The choice of the place to carry out this tradition could be a pilgrim town, a temple, a river bank or even one's residence. As part of the celebrations the couple's children perform their parents' second wedding. This is reason for a grand family reunion to incorporate an important event in the couple's married life.

==Santi==

The rituals carved out as part of Shanti are also referred to as Ugraradha Santi. Ugraradha is nothing but the harsh natured time. In a hundred-year time scale of man's life, pre-sixty is a period of materialistic pursuit while the post-sixty span is slated for spiritual endeavour. The Ugraradha Shanti is a prayer sent to the heavens to make the post-sixty span a spiritually fulfilling experience.

Three different ways are chiseled to carry out the Santi aspect. They are "Sounakoktam, Bodhaayanoktam and Saivaagamoktam".

The basic elements of these three ways remain the same, though the contents vary marginally. Of all, Saivaagamokta Shanti is very elaborate and ritual-laden. Given its exhaustive scope of rituals, only a limited few like the kings and the emperors can follow it in toto, though it is not entirely ruled out for devout householders.

==Kranti==

After the successful completion of the "Shanti" programme, the Kranthi programme follows in which "Kalyaanam" is very important. "Kranthi" means "to step ahead" and signifies heading towards a new life.

"Shastipoorti" is a good bridge - builder between the householder's domestic concerns and Vaanaprasta's spiritual yearnings. During Vaanaprastha, the married couple is to fulfill their life's mission by staying together through observance of celibacy. The "Kalyaana Veduka" is a reminder of the unique role they are to play in the years to come. Marriage in the younger days promises physical proximity, while the one performed now brings about spiritual affinity.

Thus the Shanti - Kranthi aspects, which run through the "Shastipoorthi" celebrations provide a fusion of spiritual and social obligations which are the very bed rock the Indian culture.

==Ceremony==

This ceremony should be performed as per Guru and elderly persons instructions. Generally this ceremony is two days programme. The ceremony is commenced in Shubha Muhurutham by performing "Yamuna Pooja", followed by the "Ganga Pooja", "Ishta Devatha Vandana", "Sabha Vandana", "Punyaha with Panchagaavya Sevana", "Naandi Pooja", "Ruthwikgvarana" and Kalasha Sthapana".

Kalasha sthapana of the deities - "Maha Ganapathi", "Adithyadhi Navagraha", "Mrutunjaya","Samvatsara-Aayana-Ruthu-Maasa-Paksha-Yoga devatha", "Karana devatha", "Raashyadhipathi (pathi and pathni)", "Navadurga", "Sapthama Maru Devatha", "Dwadasa Aditya  - Dhata, Aryama, Mitra, Varuna, Indra, Vivasvan, Tvashtha, Vishnu, Amshuman, Bhaga, Pusha and Parjanja", "Ayurdevatha, Istadevatha, Kuladevatha". Next Avaahana-Praana Pratishtapanam, Shodashopachara pooja, Mahamangalaarathi, Navagraha and Ganapati Homam.

'''Sholom Dovber Schneersohn''' ({{lang-he-n|שלום דובער שניאורסאהן}}) was an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] [[rabbi]] and the fifth [[Rebbe]] (spiritual leader) of the [[Chabad Lubavitch]] [[Hasidic Judaism|chasidic]] movement. He is also known as "'''the Rebbe ''nishmosei eiden'''''" (whose soul is in Eden) and as "'''the Rebbe Rashab'''" (for '''R'''eb '''Sh'''olom '''B'''er).

His teachings represent the emergence of an emphasis on outreach that later Chabad Rebbes developed into a major theme.&lt;ref&gt;''The Messiah of Brooklyn: Understanding Lubavitch Hasidim Past and Present'', M. Avrum Ehrlich, Chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
He was born in [[Lyubavichi, Rudnyansky District, Smolensk Oblast|Lubavitch]], on 20 Cheshvan 1860, the second son of [[Shmuel Schneersohn]], the fourth Chabad ''Rebbe''.&lt;ref name="sad"&gt;''Encyclopedia of Hasidim, entry: Schneersohn, Shalom Dovber''. Naftali Lowenthal. Aronson, London 1996. {{ISBN|1-56821-123-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1882, when his father died, he was not quite 22 years old, and his brother Reb Zalman Aharon was not much older.  A period followed, during which both brothers fulfilled some of the tasks of a rebbe, but neither felt ready to take on the title and responsibilities.  Over this period he gradually took on more responsibilities, particularly in dealing with the impact of the [[May Laws]], and on [[Rosh Hashanah]] 5643 (10 September 1892 OS) he accepted the leadership of the Lubavitch movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hayom Yom|last=Shneerson|first=M.

He married his cousin, Rebbetzin Shterna Sara Schneersohn. She was the daughter of Rabbi Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn of Avorutch, a son of the Tzemach Tzedek. They had one son whom they named [[Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn|Yosef Yitzchok]] after Rebbetzin Shterna Sara's father. [[Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn|Yosef Yitzchok]] later succeeded his father as Rebbe.

In his early 40s he suffered a loss of sensation in his left hand, and in 1903 he spent two months in Vienna, where [[Sigmund Freud]] treated him with [[electrotherapy]]. The treatment had some success, restoring some feeling to the hand, but he was unable to stay in Vienna longer than two months.  When he returned home he attempted to continue his treatment with a small machine that he had bought in Vienna, but experienced no further improvement and eventually gave up.&lt;ref&gt;Letters from the Rashab to his cousin Rabbi Isaiah Berlin of Riga, dated 6-Tevet through 22-Iyar 5663&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1915, as the fighting in [[World War I]] neared Lubavitch, the Rashab moved to [[Rostov-on-Don]]. As Bolshevik forces approached Rostov he considered moving to [[Israel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Toras Menachem Hisva'aduyos vol.1|last=Shneerson|first=M.

But eventually he decided to stay in Rostov, where he died on 21 March 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tog.co.il/|title=הדף לא נמצא|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the construction of the "Rostov Palace of Sport" on top of the Old Jewish Cemetery in 1940, his remains were secretly moved by a devout group of chassidim to a different burial site where they are located to this day in the "Rostov Jewish Cemetery." While relocating his grave, the chassidim found his body full and not decomposed even though this was a full twenty years later. His grave is visited daily by followers of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement who come from all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fjc.ru/news/newsArticle.asp?aid=1040102|title=Rostov Celebrates the Rebbe Rashab's Birthday|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203002010/http://fjc.ru/news/newsArticle.asp?aid=1040102|archivedate=2013-12-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership==
Rabbi Schneersohn  established the first Chabad [[yeshiva]], [[Tomchei Temimim]], in 1897. In 1911 he established another yeshivah, [[Toras Emes]], in Palestine, and in 1916 he established a yeshivah in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. Avrum Erlich has argued that it was these institutions that made Lubavitch the dominant of the various Chabad Hasidic movements.&lt;ref name="sholom"/&gt;

He maintained a lengthy correspondence, not only with Chabad Chasidim in other countries, but also with non-Chabad chasidim and members of other groups who wrote to him for advice. He also met with other Jewish and hasidic leaders, working with them on issues such as education, unity, policy, and strategy.&lt;ref name="sholom"&gt;''The Messiah of Brooklyn: Understanding Lubavitch Hasidim Past and Present'', M. Avrum Ehrlich, Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt; He was held in high esteem by the [[Yisrael Meir Kagan|Chofetz Chaim]], so much so that the Chofetz Chaim declared of him, "the words of the [Lubavitcher] Rebbe are holy, and anyone who argues disagrees with him [should know that] it is as if he is disagreeing with [[Moses]]."&lt;ref&gt;''Shemu'os Vesippurim'', Refoel Kahn, vol. 1, pp. 144-145&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi Schneersohn promoted Jewish agricultural settlement, and the creation of employment for Jews, particularly those displaced by the [[May Laws]]. He was a prominent opponent of [[Zionism]], both in its secular and religious versions, and a staunch ally of [[Chaim Soloveitchik|Reb Chaim Brisker]]. In 1903 he published ''Kuntres Uma'ayan'', which contained a strong polemic against Zionism. He was deeply concerned that secular nationalism would replace Judaism as the foundation of Jewish identity.&lt;ref name="Goldman2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Shalom Goldman|title=Zeal for Zion: Christians, Jews, and the Idea of the Promised Land|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ibbL2ow7gYoC&amp;pg=PA272|accessdate=9 May 2013|year=2009|publisher=UNC Press Books|isbn=978-0-8078-3344-5|pages=272–73|quote=The most eminent Orthodox rabbis of the first decade of the twentieth century, among them the Lubavitcher rebbe Sholom Dov Ber Schneersohn, issued powerful condemnations of political Zionism. Schneersohn, in 1903, warned that the Zionists "have made nationalism a substitute for the Torah and the commandments… After this assumption is accepted, anyone who enters the movement regards himself as no longer obliged to keep the commandments of the Torah, nor is there any hope consequently that at some time or another he will return, because, according to his own reckoning, he is a proper Jew in that he is a loyal nationalist.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Together with Reb Chaim he joined and supported [[Machazikei Hadas]] - a union of Eastern European [[haredim]] and the forerunner of [[World Agudath Israel|the Agudah]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tog.co.il/|title=הדף לא נמצא|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; - but in 1912, when the Agudah was formed in [[Katowice]], Reb Chaim raised 18 objections to its constitution, and the Rashab kept Lubavitch out of the Agudah.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shmais.com/pages.cfm?page=chabaddetail&amp;ID=425 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100204101537/http://www.shmais.com/pages.cfm?page=chabaddetail&amp;ID=425 |date=February 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[February Revolution]], elections were called for Jewish city councils and a General Jewish Assembly. The Rebbe Rashab worked tirelessly to organize a religious front with a center and a special office to deal with it all. For this reason, he called a unique conference of all the [[Torah]] giants throughout [[Russia]]. This conference was held in 1917 in [[Moscow]], and was preceded by a meeting of the leading Rabbis, to decide the matters to be discussed there. This smaller meeting was held in [[Petrograd]]. However, because the participants in this meeting were few and in a hurry to return home, the Moscow conference failed to yield proper results. Thus, it was necessary to convene once again in [[Kharkiv]] in 1918, to discuss the elections for the General Jewish Assembly.&lt;ref name="four"&gt;The Four Worlds, Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn, Kehot, 2006, pp. 87-90. {{ISBN|0-8266-0462-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His worries about the [[Mountain Jews]], or ''Berg Yidden'', led him to send a famous [[Mashpia]], Rabbi Shmuel Levitin of [[Rakshik]], to the [[Caucasus]] to set up institutions to bring them closer to traditional Judaism,&lt;ref name="sad"/&gt; setting a precedent for his two successors as Lubavitcher Rebbe, who conducted similar activities.

Distinguished disciples of the Rebbe Rashab include [[Reb (Yiddish)|Reb]] [[Itche Der Masmid]], Reb [[Levi Yitzchok Schneerson]], and Reb [[Zalman Moishe HaYitzchaki]].&lt;ref&gt;''Yiras Hashem Otzaro'', Yisroel Alfenbein, Israel, 2005, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chaim Avraham Dov Ber Levine HaCohen|Malach]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uEP5KNUAFh0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=jerome+mintz&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|first=Jerome R. |last=Mintz |title=Hasidic people: A place in the new world |year=1992|isbn=0-674-38115-7 |publisher=Harvard University Press |page=21|quote="Such a man was Rabbi Chaim Avraham Dov Ber Levine HaCohen, a respected Lubavitcher rabbi and sage who was known as the Malach (Angel).

==Works==
Known informally as "Rambam ([[Maimonides]]) of Chabad Chassidus" (from his encyclopedic work on developing Chabad Chassidic philosophy into an organized system), Rebbe Rashab was a prolific writer on Chabad theology.  Much of his work has been published in Hebrew, and some of it has been translated into English, and is available online.
*''Sefer HaMa'amarim'' - a 29-volume set of Chasidic discourses, according to the years  set. The most important of these include two three-year-long cycle of discourses beginning "[[Samech Vov|Yom Tov Shel Rosh Hashanah 5666]]" ("Samech-Vov") and "B'shaah Shehikdimu 5672 (Ayin-Beis)".  They serve today as major in-depth encyclopedic introductory works into "oral" Chabad Chassidism (as opposed to the "written" one, i.e., [[Tanya]]) studied in Chabad [[yeshiva]]s.

[[File:BASA-516K-1-2080-10-Suleiman the Magnificent.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|The Sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Suleiman I]] is considered one of the most famous [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Ottoman Sultans|sultans]].]]
'''Sultan''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ʌ|l|t|ən}}; {{lang-ar|سلطان}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|sulṭān}}'', {{IPA-ar|sʊlˈtˤɑːn, solˈtˤɑːn|pron}}) is a [[Royal and noble ranks|position]] with several historical meanings. Originally, it was an Arabic [[abstract noun]] meaning "strength", "authority", "rulership", derived from the [[verbal noun]] {{lang|ar|سلطة}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|sulṭah}}'', meaning "authority" or "power". Later, it came to be used as the title of certain rulers who claimed almost full sovereignty in practical terms (i.e., the lack of dependence on any higher ruler), albeit without claiming the overall [[caliphate]], or to refer to a powerful [[governor]] of a province within the caliphate. The adjective form of the word is "sultanic",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/sultanic?s=t Sultanic - Define sultan at dictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[dynasty]] and lands ruled by a sultan are referred to as a '''sultanate''' ({{lang|ar|سلطنة}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|salṭanah}}''&lt;span style="margin-left:2px"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;.

The term is distinct from [[king]] ({{lang|ar|ملك}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|malik}}''), despite both referring to a sovereign ruler. The use of "sultan" is restricted to Muslim countries, where the title carries religious significance,&lt;ref name="Montgomery2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=James Edward Montgomery|title=ʻAbbasid Studies: Occasional Papers of the School of ʻAbbasid Studies, Cambridge, 6-10 July 2002|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VHZXeOs_xYsC&amp;pg=PA83|year=2004|publisher=Peeters Publishers|isbn=978-90-429-1433-9|pages=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kassis1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Riad Aziz Kassis|title=The Book of Proverbs and Arabic Proverbial Works|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_zvXrQ7W7PEC&amp;pg=PA65|year=1999|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-11305-3|pages=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; contrasting the more secular ''king'', which is used in both Muslim and non-Muslim countries.

A feminine form of ''sultan'', used by Westerners, is '''[[Sultana (title)|Sultana]]''' or '''Sultanah''' and this title has been used legally for some (not all) [[Muslim women]] monarchs and sultan's mothers and chief consorts. However, [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] also uses ''sultan'' for imperial lady, as [[Turkish grammar]]&amp;mdash;which is influenced by [[Persian grammar]]&amp;mdash;uses the same words for both women and men. However, this styling misconstrues the roles of wives of sultans. In a similar usage, the wife of a German [[field marshal]] might be styled ''Frau Feldmarschall'' (similarly, in French, constructions of the type ''madame la maréchale'' are quite common). The female leaders in [[Muslim history]] are correctly known as "sultanas". However, the wife of the sultan in the [[Sultanate of Sulu]] is styled as the "panguian" while the sultan's chief wife in many sultanates of [[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]] are known as "permaisuri", "Tunku Ampuan", "Raja Perempuan", or "Tengku Ampuan". The [[queen consort]] in [[Brunei]] especially is known as ''Raja Isteri'' with the title of ''Pengiran Anak'' suffixed, should the queen consort also be a royal princess.

In recent years, "sultan" has been gradually replaced by "king" by contemporary hereditary rulers who wish to emphasize their secular authority under the [[rule of law]Alternatively they are also business owners that reside in Sidcup for example The Sultan of Sidcup.]

==Compound ruler titles==
[[File:Ralamb-2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Ottoman Sultan [[Mehmed IV]] attended by a eunuch and two pages.]]
These are generally secondary titles, either lofty 'poetry' or with a message, e.g.:
*''Mani Sultan'' = ''Manney Sultan'' (meaning the "Pearl of Rulers" or "Honoured Monarch") - a subsidiary title, part of the full style of the [[Maharaja]] of [[Travancore]]
* ''[[Sultan of Sultans]]'' - the sultanic equivalent of the style [[King of Kings]]
* Certain secondary titles have a devout Islamic connotation; e.g., [[Sultan ul-Mujahidin]] as champion of [[jihad]] (to strive and to struggle in the name of Allah).
* ''Sultanic Highness'' - a rare, hybrid western-Islamic honorific style exclusively used by the son, daughter-in-law and daughters of Sultan [[Hussein Kamel of Egypt|Hussein Kamel]] of [[Egypt]] (a British [[protectorate]] since 1914), who bore it with their primary titles of [[Prince]] (''{{transl|ar|[[Amir]]}}''; {{Lang-tr|[[Prens]]}}) or [[Princess]], after 11 October 1917. They enjoyed these titles for life, even after the Royal Rescript regulating the styles and titles of the Royal House following Egypt's [[Unilateral Declaration of Egyptian Independence|independence in 1922]], when the sons and daughters of the newly styled king (''{{transl|ar|[[malik]] Misr}}'', considered a promotion) were granted the title ''Sahib(at) us-Sumuw al-Malaki'', or [[Royal Highness]].

==Princely and aristocratic titles==
[[File:Nicolas de Nicolay- La grande dame turcque.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|The [[Valide Sultan]] (Sultana mother) of the [[Ottoman Empire]] ]]
By the beginning of the 16th century, the title sultan was carried by both men and women of the Ottoman dynasty and was replacing other titles by which prominent members of the imperial family had been known (notably ''khatun'' for women and ''bey'' for men). This usage underlines the Ottoman conception of sovereign power as family prerogative.

Western tradition knows the Ottoman ruler as "sultan", but Ottomans themselves used "padişah" (emperor) or "hünkar" to refer to their ruler. The emperor's formal title consisted of "sultan" together with "khan" (for example, Sultan Suleiman Khan). In formal address, the sultan's children were also entitled "sultan", with imperial princes (Şehzade) carrying the title before their given name, with imperial princesses carrying it after. Example, [[Şehzade Mehmed|Şehzade Sultan Mehmed]] and [[Mihrimah Sultan]], son and daughter of Suleiman the Magnificent. Like imperial princesses, living mother and main consort of reigning sultan also carried the title after their given names, for example, [[Ayşe Hafsa Sultan]], Suleiman's mother and first [[valide sultan]], and [[Roxelana|Hürrem Sultan]], Suleiman's chief consort and first [[haseki sultan]]. The evolving usage of this title reflected power shifts among imperial women, especially between [[Sultanate of Women]], as the position of main consort eroded over the course of 17th century, the main consort lost the title "sultan", which replaced by "kadin", a title related to the earlier "khatun". Henceforth, the mother of the reigning sultan was the only person of non imperial blood to carry the title "sultan".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Imperial Harem: Women and Sovereignty in the Ottoman Empire |last=Peirce |first=Leslie P. |publicationplace=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1993 |isbn=0-19-507673-7 |location= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Kazakh Khanate]] a Sultan was a lord from the ruling dynasty (a direct descendants of [[Genghis Khan]])  elected by clans, i.e. a kind of princes{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}. The best of sultans was elected as [[khan (title)|khan]] by people at [[Kurultai]]{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}. See [[:ru:Казахские султаны]]

== Sultan Agung ==
Interestingly, an title from sultan in [[Mataram Sultanate]] use "Sultan Agung" with the full title: Sultan Agung Senapati-ing-Ngalaga Abdurrahman.

In Indonesia-English translation is will translated to "Grand Sultan" or "Holy Sultan".

==Military rank==
In a number of post-caliphal states under [[Mongol]] or [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] rule, there was a [[Feudalism|feudal]] type of military hierarchy. These administrations were often decimal (mainly in larger empires), using originally princely titles such as [[Khan (title)|khan]], [[malik]], [[amir]] as mere rank denominations.

In the [[Persian empire]], the rank of sultan was roughly equivalent to that of a modern-day [[Captain (OF-2)|captain]] in the West; socially in the fifth-rank class, styled '[[Ali Jah]].

The '''Temple of Beit el-Wali''' is a rock-cut [[Ancient Egypt]]ian temple in Nubia which was built by Pharaoh [[Ramesses II]] and dedicated to the deities of [[Amun-Re]], [[Re-Horakhti]], [[Khnum]] and [[Anuket]].&lt;ref name="arnold20"&gt;Arnold &amp; Strudwick (2003), p.29&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first in a series of temples built by Ramesses II in this region; its name Beit el-Wali means 'House of the Holy Man' and may indicate its previous use by a Christian hermit at some point in time.&lt;ref name="Oakes200"&gt;Oakes (2003), p.200&lt;/ref&gt; The temple was relocated during the 1960s as a result of the [[Aswan]] High Dam project and moved towards [[New Kalabsha|higher ground]] along with the [[Temple of Kalabsha]]. This move was coordinated with a team of Polish archaeologists financed jointly by a Swiss and Chicago Institute respectively. The temple was located 50 kilometres south of Aswan.&lt;ref name="arnold20"/&gt;

==Political history==
[[File:John Beasly Greene (American, born France - (Bet-Oualli, Sculptures Historiques de la Paroi de Gauche) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Earliest photo, 1854 by [[John Beasley Greene]]]]
The Nubian temples of Ramesses II (i.e. [[Wadi es-Sebua]], Beit el-Wali and [[Abu Simbel]]), were part of a state sponsored policy designed to maintain Egyptian control over this area.&lt;ref name="Oakes200"/&gt; During the New Kingdom period of Egypt, Nubia was not only ruled by Egyptian officials but also subject to:
: "a deliberate policy of acculturation, the intention of which was to break down Nubian identity. Many leading Nubians were educated in Egypt and adopted Egyptian dress, burial customs and religion. They spoke the Egyptian language and even changed their names to Egyptian ones. the decoration of the temples was to some extent royal propaganda intended to intimidate the [local] population."&lt;ref name="Oakes200"/&gt;

==Temple architecture and decorations==
[[Image:Beit el-Wali temple relief in Nubia.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Wall relief of Ramesses II making an offering to [[Horus]] at Beit el-Wali temple]]
[[Image:Beit el-Wali relief of Ramesses II smiting an enemy by John Campana.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Relief of Ramesses II smiting an enemy of Egypt from Beit el-Wali]]
[[Image:Relief of Ramesses II from Beit el-Wali temple by John Campana.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Relief of Ramesses II being suckled by [[Anuket]] and offered life by [[Khnum]]]]
There is a large amount of original colour remaining in the inner part of this temple though the paint has disappeared from the historical scenes on its Forecourt.&lt;ref name="Oakes200"/&gt; Near the middle of the south wall of the temple, Ramesses II is depicted charging into battle against the Nubians while his two young sons Amun-her-khepsef and Khaemwaset are shown being present in this relief scene. In the next relief scene,
: "Ramesses [is] enthroned, receiving the tribute of Nubia. In the upper register, Ramesses' eldest son and the viceroy Amenemope present the tribute procession. The viceroy is rewarded for his efforts with gold collars."&lt;ref name="Oakes201"&gt;Oakes (2003), p.201&lt;/ref&gt;

"A painted cast from a wall relief" in the Beit el-Wali temple then illustrates the wealth of exotic products which the Egyptians obtained in trade or tribute from the Kushites; here, the pharaoh receives "leopard-skins, giraffe tails, giraffes, monkeys, leopards, cattle, antelopes, gazelles, lions, ostrich feathers and eggs, ebony, ivory, fans, bowls, shields made of [animal] hides, and gold."&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Quirke &amp; Jeffrey Spenser (ed.), The British Museum Book of Ancient Egypt, Thames &amp; Hudson 1994. p.212&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the Nubians who are part of the tribute "would be destined to be taken to Egypt to work on the king's building projects, act as policemen or be recruited into the army for service in Syria."&lt;ref name="Oakes201"/&gt; The overriding theme of Egyptian military success is also hammered home on the opposite wall, where Ramesses II's triumphal campaigns in Libya and Syria were recorded: he is portrayed trampling his enemies and holding others "by their hair in his left hand while smiting them with his right."&lt;ref name="Oakes201"/&gt;

The theme of Ramesses' might is also carried into the temple's interior where there are further smiting scenes on the walls of the vestibule.&lt;ref name="Oakes201"/&gt; Henceforth, Ramesses II is shown as a pious ruler who worships other deities; besides the doorway leading to the sanctuary "are niches containing statues of the king with (on the left) Isis and Horus and (on the right) Khnum and Anuket, the gods of Elephantine and the First Cataract."&lt;ref name="Oakes201"/&gt;  The pharaoh is shown presenting vases of wine to Khnum.&lt;ref&gt;Rosalie David, Discovering Ancient Egypt, facts on File 1993. p.103&lt;/ref&gt; The deity Anuket offers Ramesses several jubilees. The sanctuary contains 3 rock-cut cult images perhaps that of Amun, Ptah and Ramesses II.&lt;ref name="arnold103"&gt;Arnold &amp; Strudwick (2003), p.103&lt;/ref&gt; The most touching scenes are on eitherside of the doorway where Ramesses is shown as a child being suckled by Isis and Anuket; however, the statue niche was destroyed later perhaps in the Christian era.&lt;ref name="Oakes201"/&gt; The exquisite reliefs of Beit el-Wali and its unusual plan differentiates it from later temples by this pharaoh which are located further south in Nubia.&lt;ref name="arnold103"/&gt;

The temple of Beit el-Wali is small, and was built on a symmetrical level. It is made up of a forecourt, an anteroom with two columns and a sanctuary cut into the surrounding rock, with the exception of the entrance and the doorway. The temple was fronted by a [[Pylon (architecture)|pylon]].&lt;ref name="arnold20"/&gt;

At the beginning of the Christian Coptic period, the temple was used as a church. Many early travellers visited the temple; its architectural and artistic details were published by Günther Roeder&lt;ref name="arnold103"/&gt; in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Roeder (1938)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Unbelievers''''' is a 2013 documentary film that follows [[Richard Dawkins]] and [[Lawrence M. Krauss|Lawrence Krauss]] as they speak publicly around the globe about the importance of science and reason in the modern world, encouraging others to cast off religious and politically motivated approaches toward what they think to be important current issues. The film includes short statements by influential people and celebrities such as [[Stephen Hawking]], [[Ayaan Hirsi Ali]], [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]], [[Cameron Diaz]], [[Woody Allen]], [[Penn Jillette]], [[Ian McEwan]], and [[David Silverman (activist)|David Silverman]].

==Making of==

{{quote|"There is no through-line, we just wanted to show what it is like to be them".|sign=Luke Holwerda&lt;ref name=filmqa/&gt;}}

Gus Holwerda came to know Lawrence Krauss via [[Christopher Hitchens]] and first met him at an [[Lawrence M. Krauss#Career|Origins Symposium]]. Being at the event, which they viewed as a kind of [[Woodstock]] for science, Gus and Luke Holwerda conceived the idea of following Krauss around on his lectures and debates and documenting his venture in the style of a rock band tour movie. 

The plan was not realized immediately, but Krauss approached the two when the Origins Symposium wanted to archive its events. The quality of their work with Origins eventually convinced him to go on with the movie project, which "fortuitously" began when Krauss and Richard Dawkins went on an Australian tour.

Gus and Luke Holwerda followed them around for 8 months and produced 120 hours of films. Each interview with the celebrities lasted an hour. Woody Allen, a friend of Lawrence Krauss, was the first celebrity interviewee.&lt;ref name=filmqa&gt;{{Youtube|w5-jG20whow|"The Unbelievers" Documentary: Q&amp;A with Lawrence Krauss, Luke and Gus Holwerda, May 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Thoth Tarot''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|t|oʊ|t|_|ˈ|t|ær|oʊ}}) is a [[divinatory tarot]] deck painted by [[Lady Frieda Harris]] according to instructions from [[Aleister Crowley]].  Crowley referred to this deck as ''[[The Book of Thoth (Crowley)|The Book of Thoth]]'', and also wrote a book of that title intended for use with the deck.

==Background==
Crowley originally intended the Thoth deck to be a six-month project aimed at updating the traditional pictorial symbolism of the tarot. However, due to increased scope the project eventually spanned five years, between 1938 and 1943 and both artists died before publication in 1969 by [[Ordo Templi Orientis]]. Crowley and Harris painted some of the cards as many as eight times. The current edition of the U.S. Games Systems deck has two prototypes by Lady Harris but then rejected by Crowley. In 1977 Harris' paintings were rephotographed for a second edition and further revisions followed in 1986 and 1996.

==Symbolism==
The illustrations of the deck feature symbolism based upon Crowley's incorporation of imagery from many disparate disciplines, including science and philosophy and various occult systems (as described in detail in his ''Book of Thoth).''

==Differences from Rider Waite Tarot==
===Order and names of trumps===
Crowley renamed several of the trumps, and also re-arranged the [[astrology|astrological]] and [[Hebrew alphabet]] correspondences of some cards, in accordance with his earlier book, ''[[Liber AL vel Legis]]'' ([[The Book of the Law]]):

:''All these old letters of my Book are aright; but צ is not the Star.'' (AL I:57)

===Names of court cards===
[[File:Thoth_tarot_deck.jpg|thumb|right|A Thoth tarot deck.]]
Crowley altered the names of all the court cards which can cause some confusion for people used to the more common decks. The typical corresponding names are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wang |first=Robert |date= June 1987 |title=The Qabalistic Tarot |publisher=Weiser Books |isbn=9780877286721}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;
વૈષ્ણવ જન તો તેને કહિયે 
જે પીડ પરાયી જાણે રે
પર દુ:ખે ઉપકાર કરે તો યે 
મન અભિમાન ન આણે રે. ॥ધૃ॥
&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;
वैष्णव जन तो तेने कहिये 
जे पीड परायी जाणे रे ।
पर दुःखे उपकार करे तो ये 
मन अभिमान न आणे रे ॥

&lt;poem&gt;
Call those people [[Vaishnava]]s who
Feel the pain of others,
Help those who are in misery,
But never let self-conceit enter their mind.
&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;
સકળ લોકમાં સહુને વંદે,

વાચ કાછ મન નિશ્છળ રાખે 
ધન ધન જનની તેની રે. ॥૧॥

&lt;poem&gt;
सकळ लोकमां सहुने वंदे, 
निंदा न करे केनी रे ।

&lt;poem&gt;
They respect the entire world,
Do not disparage anyone,
Keep their words, actions and thoughts pure,
The mother of such a soul is blessed.
&lt;/poem&gt; 
|-

&lt;poem&gt;
સમદૃષ્ટિ ને તૃષ્ણા ત્યાગી

પરધન નવ ઝાલે હાથ રે. ॥૨॥
&lt;/poem&gt; 
|
&lt;poem&gt;
समदृष्टि ने तृष्णा त्यागी,

&lt;poem&gt;
They see all equally, renounce craving,
Respect other women as their own mother,
Their tongue never utters false words,
Their hands never touch the wealth of others.

&lt;poem&gt;
They do not succumb to worldly attachments,
They are firmly detached from the mundane,
They are enticed by the name of God,
All places of pilgrimage are embodied in them.
&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;
વણ લોભી ને કપટ રહિત છે,

કુળ એકોતેર તાર્યાં રે. ॥૪॥
&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;
वणलोभी ने कपटरहित छे, 
काम क्रोध निवार्या रे ।
भणे नरसैयॊ तेनुं दरसन करतां, 
कुळ एकोतेर तार्या रे ॥
&lt;/poem&gt; 
|
&lt;poem&gt;
vaṇa-lobhī ne kapaṭa-rahita che, 
kāma krodha nivāryā re,
bhaṇe narasaiyo tenuṁ darasana karatāṁ, 
kuḷa ekotera tāryā re
&lt;/poem&gt;
|
&lt;poem&gt;
They have forsaken greed and deceit,
They stay afar from lust and anger,
Narsi says: I'd be grateful to meet such a soul,
Whose virtue liberates their entire lineage.
&lt;/poem&gt;

A '''wedding ring''' or '''wedding band''' is a [[finger ring]] that indicates that its wearer is [[marriage|married]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dictionary.com/browse/wedding-ring|title= Wedding Ring |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016 |website= Harper Collins Dictionary (dictionary.com) |publisher=Harper Collins &amp; Son |access-date=8 Sep 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually forged from [[metal]], and traditionally is forged of [[gold]] or another precious metal.&lt;ref name="ring material"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.weddingrings.co |title=Guide to Wedding Ring Styles, Designs &amp; Prices |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=The Wedding Rings |publisher=Polished Diamonds Ltd |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest examples of wedding rings are from [[Ancient Egypt]]. Western customs for wedding rings can be traced to [[ancient Rome]] and [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], and were transmitted to the present through [[Christendom]] in [[Europe]], which adapted the ancient customs.

Depending on culture, a wedding ring is typically worn on the base of the left or right [[ring finger]], if the wearer is left handed often it will go onto the right hand. Many spouses wear their wedding rings day and night, causing an indentation in the skin that is visible even when the ring is removed. Since the 19th century in the West, it has been considered unlucky to remove a wedding ring once it has been placed on the finger in church.&lt;ref name="Monger2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Monger|first=George|title=Marriage Customs of the World: From Henna to Honeymoons|year=2004|publisher=ABC-CLIO|language=English|isbn=9781576079874|page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Byzantine - Marriage Ring with Scenes from the Life of Christ - Walters 4515 - Right.jpg|thumb|''Marriage Ring with Scenes from the Life of Christ'', {{circa}} 6th century, [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Byzantine_-_Marriage_Ring_with_Scenes_from_the_Life_of_Christ_-_Walters_4515_-_Right.jpg Walters Art Museum]]]
It is commonly believed that the first examples of wedding rings were found in [[ancient Egypt]]. [[Relic]]s dating to 6,000 years ago, including [[papyrus]] scrolls, are evidence of the exchange of braided rings of [[hemp]] or [[Reed (plant)|reeds]] between spouses. [[Ancient Egypt]] considered the circle to be a symbol of eternity, and the ring served to signify the perpetual love of the spouses. This was also the origin of the custom of wearing the wedding ring on the ring finger of the left hand, because the ancient Egyptians believed that this finger enclosed a special [[vein]] that was connected directly to the heart,&lt;ref name="Some Tradition About Rings"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hort|first1=G.M.|title=Some Tradition About Rings|journal=The Irish Monthly|date=1919|volume=47|pages=650, 654}}&lt;/ref&gt; denominated in [[Latin]] the "[[Vena amoris]]".

The Western traditions of wedding rings can be traced to [[ancient Rome]] and [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], and were first associated with the marital [[dowry]] and later with a promise of [[fidelity]]. The modern exchange of rings derived from the customs of [[Europe]] in the [[Middle Ages]] as part of [[Christendom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Oliver|first1=Juliet|title=Where Do Wedding Rings Come From?|url=http://www.julietoliver.com/blog/where-do-wedding-rings-come-from-/|accessdate=9 September 2014|date=4 September 2014| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910195546/http://www.julietoliver.com/blog/where-do-wedding-rings-come-from-/|archivedate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States]], wedding rings were initially only worn by [[wife|wives]], but became customary for both [[husband]]s and wives during the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Howard"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Howard |first1=Vicki |year=2003 |title=A 'Real Man's Ring': Gender and the Invention of Tradition |journal=Journal of Social History |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=837–856 |doi=10.1353/jsh.2003.0098}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical styles===

====Gimmel rings====
[[File:Gimmal ring british museum.JPG|thumb|right|Gimmel ring with the hoop opened, in the British Museum]]
[[File:Wedding ring with heart shadow.jpg|thumb|Wedding ring of [[groom]] and a [[bride]] with shadow in form of [[Heart (symbol)|heart]] -  symbolic sense of love]]
During the 16th and 17th centuries, European husbands bestowed a [[gimmel ring]] upon their wives. Similar to the [[puzzle ring]], the [[gimmel ring]] consisted of two interlocking bands. The bride and groom both wore one of these bands after their engagement, and the two bands were reunited during the wedding ceremony. Subsequently, the wife wore the combined ring.&lt;ref name="Some Tradition About Rings"/&gt;

====Poesy rings====
The poesy ring was a style of ring that was popular during the [[Renaissance]] era. It was a band of sterling [[silver]] inscribed with a poem or "poesy".&lt;ref name="Some Tradition About Rings"/&gt;

====Other styles====
Different cultures used many other historical styles of wedding ring. For example, see the image below of the [[Byzantine era|Byzantine]] ring depicting [[Christ]] uniting bride and groom. Also, in the [[Middle East]] the puzzle ring was a historical custom: this ring consisted of several pieces that joined together into a cohesive band when worn properly. The object of this style of ring was to render it very difficult to put on the finger properly such that, if the wife removed it, her husband would know. The [[fede ring]], being a band consisting of two hands clasped in betrothal, is another historical custom of [[Europe]] that ostensibly dates from antiquity.

====Limited gold content in the United Kingdom====
In 1942 during the [[Second World War]], [[United Kingdom|British]] wartime restrictions on the manufacture of jewelry resulted in "utility" wedding rings that were limited to a maximum mass of two [[pennyweight]]s, being slightly heavier than 3 grams, and were forged of 9 carat gold rather than the traditional 22 carat.&lt;ref name=Church102&gt;{{cite book |last=Church |first=Rachel |date=2014 |title=Rings |publisher=V&amp;A Publishing |page=102 |isbn=9781851777853}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Regional Assayer Office hallmarked these rings, which guaranteed their gold content and compliance with the wartime regulations with a special utility mark adjacent to the mark for the year on the inside of the band; the hallmark resembled a capital "U" with the bottom curve absent or two parentheses enclosing a space, i. e., "( )".

===Double-ring ceremony===
The double-ring ceremony describes the exchange of wedding rings by and for both spouses. In several European nations such as the [[Nordic countries]], it is common to exchange plain engagement rings of the same form for both sexes, and typically, an additional, more precious, and bejeweled wedding ring is given to the bride. In the nuptials, the groom's ring becomes a wedding ring also, and can be bestowed anew by the bride as a part of the wedding ceremony. The engagement is commonly a matter of agreement between the two, and the wedding rings are chosen together. Both engagement and wedding rings are worn on the left hand, the bride having both rings together. Occasionally, the groom receives a separate wedding ring. In [[Germany]] and [[Austria]], both parties use engagement rings worn on the left hand. At the nuptials, a wedding ring is placed on the right hand, as in several east European nations, including [[Bulgaria]], [[Poland]], and [[Russia]]. This can be a new ring for the bride or both, or reusing the engagement rings. Any engagement rings can then remain on the left hand or be transferred to the right hand. In Germany, it has been customary for both the bride and the groom to wear a wedding ring since at least the 1870s&lt;ref name="The Ring of Rings"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chambers|first1=W &amp; R |title=The Ring of Rings|journal=Chamber's Journal of Popular Literature, Science and Arts|date=1872|pages=352}}&lt;/ref&gt; and mentions of couples exchanging rings during the wedding ceremony in the Netherlands can be found at least as far back as 1815.&lt;ref name=Gartman&gt;{{cite book | last = Gartman | first = Hendrik | title = Eugenia, de zegepraal over de liefde | publisher = Hendrik Gartman| year = 1815 |url=https://books.google.be/books?id=ud9NAAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=ringen&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Brazil]], [[Mexico]] and [[Spain]] both sexes also wear engagement rings, and the groom's ring often becomes a wedding ring in the nuptial exchange ceremony. In The Netherlands plain bands can be worn on either hand, left for Catholics and right for Protestants. When engaged, both bride and groom wear what will be the wedding band on the opposite hand and switch hands after the wedding.

==Compositions and styles==
In Western nations, wedding rings are often forged of rose, white, or yellow [[colored gold|gold]]; [[palladium]], [[platinum]], [[sterling silver|argentium silver]], or, more recently, [[silicone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/car-accessories/news/a25180/qalo-wants-to-save-your-flesh-and-your-cash-with-these-medical-grade-silicone-rings/|title=I ditched my wedding ring for a silicone band|date=4 March 2015|work=[[Road &amp; Track]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inquisitr.com/3028629/rubber-wedding-bands-150000-annual-ring-avulsion-injuries-make-silicone-wedding-rings-more-popular/|title=Rubber Wedding Bands: 150,000 Annual Ring Avulsion Injuries Make Silicone Wedding Rings More Popular|work=[[The Inquisitr]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The perpetuity of [[noble metal]]s symbolizes the permanence of the [[marriage]]. Common [[engraving]]s on the inside of the ring include the name of one's spouse, the names of both spouses, the date of the wedding, and/or a phrase of significance to the spouses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shannonnicolesmith.com/western-wedding-rings/|title=Western Wedding Rings in the Western World|last=Smith|first=Shannon Nicole|work=Shannon Nicole Smith Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many nations the [[engagement ring]]s are plain while the bride's wedding ring commonly is bejeweled.

Some customs include the wedding ring as the final of a series of gifts, which also may include the engagement ring, traditionally given as a [[betrothal]] present. This custom was practiced in [[ancient Rome]] and is possibly much older.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |quote="The Romans are also thought to have originated the custom of betrothal rings, or engagement rings, symbolizing a promise of marriage to a member of the opposite sex." |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |title=Ring}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==

===Wedding ceremony customs===
[[Image:Placing a wedding ring.jpg|thumb|left|A groom placing a wedding ring on the finger of his bride during a wedding ceremony]]

In several traditions, the [[best man]] or [[maid of honour]] has the duty of keeping track of a couple's wedding rings and to produce them at the symbolic moment of the giving and receiving of the rings during the traditional marriage ceremony. In more elaborate weddings, a [[Ringbearer|ring bearer]] (who is often part of the family of the bride or groom) may assist in the ceremonial parading of the rings into the ceremony, sometimes on a special cushion.

Among [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic]] Christians, the exchange of rings is not technically part of the wedding service, but rather are exchanged at the betrothal. It is always a two-ring set given to her by the priest or by the best man.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt; The orthodox Christian [[Church of Greece]] has recently stopped performing betrothal blessings separately, as these were often non-committing, and now a betrothal ceremony is the initial part of the wedding service. In many families an informal blessing is now performed by the betrothed ones' parents in a family dinner that formalizes the betrothal. The ceremony of betrothal is now possibly performed immediately before the wedding (or "crowning" as it is more properly called), and the actual symbolic act of marriage is not the exchange of rings, but the crowning.

Historically, the wedding ring was connected to the exchange of valuables at the moment of the wedding rather than a symbol of eternal love and devotion, a sign of "earnest money". According to the 1549 edition of the [[Book of Common Prayer]]: after the words 'with this ring I thee wed' follow the words 'This gold and silver I give thee', at which point the groom was supposed to hand a leather purse filled with gold and silver coins to the bride.&lt;ref name=KunzRing&gt;{{cite book | last = Kunz | first = George Frederick |authorlink=George Frederick Kunz| title = Rings for the Finger | publisher = J.B. Lippincott Co.| year = 1917 |url=http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/kunz-rings/page_289}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a relic of the times when marriage was a contract between families, not individual lovers. Both families were then eager to ensure the economic safety of the young couple. Sometimes it went as far as being a conditional exchange as this old (and today outdated) German formula shows: 'I give you this ring as a sign of the marriage which has been promised between us, provided your father gives with you a marriage portion of 1000 [[Reichsthaler|Reichsthalers]]' (approximately 20 kg of [[silver]]).&lt;ref name = KunzRing/&gt;

===Post-wedding customs===

Modernly, after marriage the wedding ring is worn on the hand on which it had been placed during the ceremony. By wearing rings on their fourth fingers, married spouses symbolically declare their life-long love for and fidelity to each other. This symbol has public utility, and is presently expected as a matter of [[tradition]] and [[etiquette]], so much so that its absence is often interpreted as meaning that the person is single. Many spouses wear their wedding rings day and night. When needed because of hygiene or to avoid damage, they commonly wear their rings on a necklace.

Some cultures exchange additional rings: In some parts of [[India]], [[Hindu]] women may wear a [[toe ring]] or "bichiya" instead of a finger ring, but the bichiya is increasingly worn in addition to a finger ring. In eastern India, primarily in [[West Bengal]], women wear an iron [[bangle]] denominated a "loha". Increasingly, this bangle is plated with gold or silver to improve its appearance. In [[Romania]], spouses celebrate their silver [[wedding anniversary]], i. e., twenty-fifth anniversary, by exchanging silver wedding rings, which are worn on the fourth finger of the left hands along with their original, and usually gold, wedding rings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first =Sheri | last =Stritof | title =History of Wedding Anniversary Gift Lists | work = About.com: People &amp; Relationships – Marriage | publisher =About.com | url =http://marriage.about.com/od/anniversariescelebrations/a/annivhistory.htm | accessdate = 17 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Endless Variety of Engagement rings for women | url=http://edenrings.com/endless-variety-of-engagement-rings-for-women/ |publisher=Eden Rings | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150812200457/http://edenrings.com/endless-variety-of-engagement-rings-for-women/ |archivedate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wedding ceremonies that use rings===
====Christian====
*[[Anglican]] ([[Book of Common Prayer]] of 1662): "With this ring I thee wed, with my body I thee worship, and with all my worldly goods I thee endow: In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Keeling |first= William B. D. |place= Cambridge |work= Liturgiae Britannicae: Or, the Several Editions of the Book of Common Prayer of the Church of England, from Its Compilation to the Last Revision; Together with the Liturgy Set Forth for the Use of the Church of Scotland: Arranged to Shew Their Respective Variations |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lUw4AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA299 |accessdate=24 March 2014 |title= Matrimony| year=1851 |publisher= Church of England; William Pickering |page=299}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Eastern Orthodoxy]]: In the [[Marriage in the Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Service of Betrothal]], the priest makes the [[Sign of the Cross]] with rings over the bride's head while declaring three times "The servant of God (Groom) is betrothed to the handmaid of God (Bride), in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the [[Holy Spirit]]. Amen". Next, it is declared three times again over the bride's head with the names reversed, after which the rings are exchanged three times, either by the priest or [[best man]]. The [[priest]] asks God "to bless this putting on of rings with a heavenly blessing and that an Angel of the Lord will go before these Your servants, all the days of their life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher=Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Australia |title=The Sacrament of Marriage According to the Rites of The Greek Orthodox Church | url= http://www.greekorthodox.org.au/general/resources/servicebooklets/wedding | accessdate=11 March 2013 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130419152607/http://www.greekorthodox.org.au/general/resources/servicebooklets/wedding | archivedate= 19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], wedding rings are traditionally worn on the right hand.
*[[Lutheran]]: "I give you this ring as a sign of my love and faithfulness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iplc.org/docs/marriage/LBW%20Marriage%20Service.pdf|title=Marriage|year=2014|work=[[Lutheran Book of Worship]]|publisher=[[Augsburg Fortress]]|language=English|accessdate=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Roman Catholic Church]]: "''Name.'', take this ring as a sign of my love and fidelity. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher= Catholicweddinghelp |title= Blessing and Giving of Rings | url= http://catholicweddinghelp.com/topics/text-rite-of-marriage-mass.htm#rings | accessdate=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the equality of the spouses is emphasized in the [[Roman Catholic]] [[Sacrament of Marriage]], generally the bride and groom each give to the other a wedding ring and recite the above formula in turn.
====Jewish====
*[[Judaism]]: "You are consecrated to me with this ring according to the law of Moses and Israel." In [[Orthodox Judaism]], only the groom declares this in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]; but in [[Reform Judaism]], both the bride and groom declare it.&lt;ref name=Blane&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blane|first1=Steven|title= Jewish Wedding |url= http://www.jewishweddingtraditions.org/ |website= JewishWeddingTraditions.org |accessdate= 3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Orthodox Jewish men do not wear wedding rings.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.albatrus.org/english/living/ourtimes/should_men_wear_wedding_ring.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nonuse===
While most Christian Churches (such as the Catholic, Lutheran, and Anglican) have the exchange of rings within their wedding liturgies, some Christian denominations eschew the use of wedding rings. 

The wearing of [[plain dress]] has historically been practiced by many [[Methodist Church]]es, in keeping with the teaching of [[John Wesley]], who stated that people should not be "adorned with gold, or pearls, or costly apparel" (this clause is contained in The General Rules of the Methodist Church).&lt;ref name="Bunch1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bunch|first=Taylor G.|title=Exodus and Advent Movements in Type and Antitype|year=1997|publisher=TEACH Services, Inc.|isbn=9781572581210|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umc.org/what-we-believe/the-general-rules-of-the-methodist-church|title=The General Rules of the Methodist Church|publisher=[[The United Methodist Church]]|language=English|accessdate=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Methodist liturgical text, [[The Sunday Service of the Methodists]], omitted the ring ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Religion in Life|year=1948|publisher=Abingdon Press|language=English|page=519}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, members of some Methodist Churches, such as the [[Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection]] and [[Bible Methodist Connection of Churches]], do not wear wedding rings.&lt;ref name="AWMC"&gt;{{cite book|title=Discipline of the Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection|publisher=[[Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection]]|language=English|chapter=I. The Church|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.biblemethodist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/2014-Bible-Methodist-Discipline.pdf |title= Discipline of the Bible Methodist Connection of Churches |year=2014 |pages=33–34 |language= English |accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, other Methodist Churches contain the exchange of wedding rings within their services for Holy Matrimony. In the wedding liturgy for the [[Free Methodist Church]], for example, the groom and bride say the following when exchanging rings: "This ring I give you in token and pledge of our constant faith and steadfast love".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fmcusa.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/45/files/2011/07/FMC_Book-of-Discipline.pdf|title=2007 Book of Discipline|year=2007|publisher=[[Free Methodist Church]]|page=226|language=English|accessdate=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; "A Service of Christian Marriage, Rite I" contained in [[The United Methodist Book of Worship (1992)|The United Methodist Book of Worship]] states that the exchange of rings is optional but when it is done, they are [[Blessing#Christianity|blessed]] and prounced as "the outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace, signifying to us the union between Jesus Christ and His Church".&lt;ref name="UMC1992"/&gt; Following this, the bride and groom state the following as they exchange rings: "''Name'', I give you this ring as a sign of my vow, and with all that I am, and all that I have, I honor you; in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit."&lt;ref name="UMC1992"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.umcdiscipleship.org/resources/a-service-of-christian-marriage-i|title=A Service of Christian Marriage I|year=1992|publisher=[[The United Methodist Church]]|language=English|accessdate=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mennonites]] do not wear jewelry, including wedding rings, as part of their practice of [[plain dress]].&lt;ref name="Wenger2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wenger|first=John C.|title=Glimpses of Mennonite History|date=3 October 2000|publisher=Wipf &amp; Stock Publishers|language=English|isbn=9781579104658|page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of engagement, a Mennonite man often gifts his bride to be "a special clock as a token of their relationship".&lt;ref name="Scott1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Scott|first=Stephen|title=Introduction to Old Order and Conservative Mennonite Groups|date=1 January 1996|publisher=Good Books|language=English|isbn=9781680992434|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among [[Quaker Christian]]s, especially [[Conservative Friends]] and [[Central Yearly Meeting of Friends|Holiness Friends]], the wedding ring is traditionally not worn as a part of their [[testimony of simplicity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholarworks.gvsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&amp;context=rel_books|title=Seventh-day Quaker: A Spiritual Memoir|last=Ranger|first=Kim L.|year=2016|publisher=[[Grand Valley State University]]|language=English|accessdate=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among Quaker groups that do wear wedding rings, the following wording is used by the bride and groom as they are exchanged: "With this ring, I thee wed."&lt;ref name="Cartier2014"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cartier|first=Marie|title=Baby, You are My Religion: Women, Gay Bars, and Theology Before Stonewall|date=11 September 2014|publisher=Routledge|language=English|isbn=9781317544715|page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Friends General Conference]], for example, teaches that "Although wedding rings are not necessary in a Quaker wedding, the couple may exchange them if they wish. This is often done after they speak their vows."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fgcquaker.org/system/files/cloud_attachments/MMM%20Marriage%20Guidelines%202014.pdf|title=Faith and Practice of Northern Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends Chapter on Marriage Approved, May 2008 and Guidelines for Marriage Under the Care of Madison Monthly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends|year=2014|publisher=[[Friends General Conference]]|page=16|language=English|accessdate=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The YFZ Ranch was situated {{convert|45|mi|km|0}} southwest of [[San Angelo, Texas|San Angelo]] and {{convert|4|mi|km|0}} northeast of [[Eldorado, Texas|Eldorado]]. The Ranch was settled by members of the FLDS Church who left [[Hildale, Utah|Hildale]], Utah and [[Colorado City, Arizona|Colorado City]], Arizona under increasing scrutiny from the media, anti-[[polygamy]] activists and law enforcement officials.&lt;ref name=found&gt;{{cite news | first= Thomas | last= Korosec | url= http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/side2/3069543.html | title= Have polygamists found their Eldorado?

==Creation of property==
Speaking in Sunday church services on August 10, 2003, [[Warren Jeffs]] declared that the blessings of the [[Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|priesthood]] had been removed from the community of [[Short Creek Community|Short Creek]] (Colorado City and Hildale). Following the sermon, Jeffs suspended all further religious meetings but continued to allow his followers to pay their tithes and offerings to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= Colorado City Polygamists | first= Ben | last= Bistline |year= 2004 | publisher= Agreka Books | isbn= 1-888106-85-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He then turned his focus to what he called "lands of refuge": secret communities that he had started to build up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.ksl.com/index.php?nid=508&amp;sid=7005115 |title= Division over FLDS land grows wider |publisher= [[KSL-TV]] |author= Ben Winslow  |date= June 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeffs referred to Yearning for Zion Ranch, one of the lands of refuge, by the code name R17.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.gosanangelo.com/news/2010/mar/16/letters-from-jessop-to-flds-leader-read-in-court/?partner=RSS | title = FLDS TRIAL: Jessop letters read in court | author = Waller, Matthew | newspaper = [[San Angelo Standard-Times]] | date = March 16, 2010 | access-date = March 25, 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110728095957/http://www.gosanangelo.com/news/2010/mar/16/letters-from-jessop-to-flds-leader-read-in-court/?partner=RSS | archive-date = July 28, 2011 | dead-url = yes | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The YFZ Land LLC, through its president, David S. Allred, purchased the ranch in 2003 for $700,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.childbrides.org/texas_RMN_majestic_temple_rises.html | title= Majestic temple rises in Texas oil country | newspaper= [[Rocky Mountain News]] (reprint at childbrides.org) | date= July 16, 2005 | first= Deborah | last= Frazier | accessdate= April 17, 2008 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080423230050/http://www.childbrides.org/texas_RMN_majestic_temple_rises.html | archive-date= April 23, 2008 | dead-url= yes | df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and quickly began development on the property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.myeldorado.net/YFZ%20Pages/YFZ032504b.html | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20050707083014/http://www.myeldorado.net/YFZ%20Pages/YFZ032504b.html | dead-url= yes | archive-date= July 7, 2005 | title= Corporate retreat or Prophet's refuge | newspaper= [[The Eldorado Success]] | date= March 25, 2004 | accessdate= April 6, 2008 | df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; When he purchased the property, he declared that the buildings would be a corporate hunting retreat.

The ranch was home to approximately 500 people who relocated from Arizona and Utah communities. It housed a [[Temple (Latter Day Saints)|temple]], a waste treatment facility, a {{convert|29000|sqft|m2|-2|adj=on}} house for FLDS Church president [[Warren Jeffs]], a meeting house, and several large log and concrete homes.&lt;ref name=CNN2008-04-04&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/04/04/texas.ranch/ | title= 137 children removed from polygamist ranch | publisher= CNN | date= April 4, 2008 | accessdate=April 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were generators, gardens, a grain silo, and a large stone quarry that was cut for the temple. According to preliminary tax assessments, about $3 million worth of buildings had been built. The sect was  fined over $34,000 for environmental violations in connection with buildings on the ranch, mainly due to its failure to obtain the required permits for its cement-mixing operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.myeldorado.net/YFZ%20Pages/YFZ030305b.html | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20051026042811/http://www.myeldorado.net/YFZ%20Pages/YFZ030305b.html | dead-url= yes | archive-date= October 26, 2005 | title= TCEQ seeks $18813 fine against YFZ | newspaper= [[The Eldorado Success]] | date= March 3, 2005 | accessdate= April 6, 2008 | df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It's not the first time Swinton has been accused of duping authorities. She's been arrested for false reporting in two separate cases in Colorado, allegedly setting off frantic manhunts by repeatedly impersonating abuse victims. But even as she now faces possible charges in Texas, Swinton remains an elusive and enigmatic figure. As one woman who cared for her beliefs, Swinton might well be a victim of sexual abuse who fractured into multiple personalities to cope with the trauma. Others who've known her view her as a masterful manipulator with an insatiable appetite for attention. In a brief conversation with NEWSWEEK, Swinton only added to the mystery.

===Mandamus of Judge Walther===
Represented by [[Texas RioGrande Legal Aid]], mothers of the removed children sought to [[mandamus]] Judge Walther for her rulings because parents in Texas cannot simply appeal an emergency removal.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.polygamy.com/articles/878952/love-your-lawyer-suit-flds-does-not-put-children-in-danger&lt;/ref&gt;  A mandamus is available only when it is abundantly clear a state official abused his or her power.
 
On May 22, 2008, an appeals court issued a mandamus to Judge Walther and found that there was not nearly enough evidence at the original hearing that the children were in immediate danger to justify keeping them in state custody. The court added that Judge Walther had abused her discretion by keeping the children in state care. The court ruled, "The department did not present any evidence of danger to the physical health and safety of any male children or any female children who had not reached puberty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://abcnews.go.com/TheLaw/story?id=4911318&amp;page=1 | title= Court: Texas Had No Right to Keep Polygamy Kids; Appeals Court Overrules Decision Placing Sect Kids in State Custody | first= Scott | last= Michells | publisher= [[ABC News]] | date= May 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The children were to be returned to their families in 10 days.

On October 2, 2009, Judge Barbara Walther issued a ruling denying a defense motion to suppress the evidence seized from the YFZ Ranch, stating:

===Controversy===

====Rozita Swinton====
Rozita Swinton of [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]] had previously made calls pretending to be a young girl. She was under investigation for posing as the caller "Sarah" who complained of abuse, but she could not be found. FLDS women did not know of any such girl and assumed that it was a prank call. Sarah was considered a real person by CPS until May when her court case was dropped, effectively acknowledging that she does not actually exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://fieldnotes.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2008/05/21/1049578.aspx | title= Polygamist girls surprise investigators | publisher= [[MSNBC]] | date= May 21, 2008 | first= Don | last= Teague | access-date= May 23, 2008 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080525205609/http://fieldnotes.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2008/05/21/1049578.aspx | archive-date= May 25, 2008 | dead-url= yes | df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Swinton has previously been responsible for hoax calls to authorities in multiple jurisdictions, setting off large emergency responses that sometimes involved dozens of police officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.denverpost.com/opinion/ci_9029987 | title= Swinton used phone that helped spark raid | date= April 23, 2008 |newspaper= The Denver Post }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Flora Jessop]] recorded nearly 40 hours of Swinton's phone calls, both before and after the raid on the YFZ ranch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.deseretnews.com/article/1,5143,695271689,00.html | title= Is arrest tied to FLDS raid, phone calls? |newspaper= [[Deseret News]] | date= April 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Swinton posed alternately as "Sarah Barlow" and her sister Laura.

The [[Associated Press]] reported that Texas Ranger Brooks Long called Colorado officials about two phone numbers, one of which "was possibly related to the reporting party for the YFZ Ranch incident." However, the CPS acted on additional evidence gathered while investigating this complaint, and Flora Jessop and some commentators have expressed gratitude to Swinton that her tip, even if false, allowed exposure of alleged child abuses.&lt;ref name=AP-phonenumber&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5j_f6za8jjN7vLwXh3bqyHh_I3lZQD907PQ902 |title=Phone number in Texas abuse report linked to Colo. woman |date=April 23, 2008 |agency=Associated Press |first=George |last=Merritt }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Age dispute====
CPS has acknowledged that some ranch residents who were removed because they appeared to be minors may be older than first assumed. On May 13, Louisa Bradshaw Jessop gave birth to a son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.sltrib.com/ci_9238077 | title= Second FLDS mother gives birth while in Texas custody | first= Brooke | last= Adams |newspaper= [[The Salt Lake Tribune]] | date= May 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/texassouthwest/stories/DN-polygamists_13tex.ART.State.Edition1.465f366.html | title= CPS stopped in effort to remove baby, his mother |newspaper= [[The Dallas Morning News]] | date= May 13, 2008 | first= Robert T. | last= Garrett }}&lt;/ref&gt; Louisa Jessop had been classified as 17 by CPS, although her husband had previously provided a birth certificate and driver's license to demonstrate that she was 22.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.woai.com/news/state/story.aspx?content_id=c864e703-47d0-448c-97b1-23bd86b218fe&amp;rss=69 | publisher= [[WOAI-TV]] | title= Texas concedes sect woman who gave birth is adult | date= May 15, 2008 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; A CPS lawyer explained, "We can't just look at people and say, 'You're of age, you can go.'" A spokesman for FLDS believed that CPS "just wanted to keep the mother in custody until they could get the baby." Jessop was one of 27 "disputed minors," or ranch residents about whom the CPS has inaccurate or conflicting information regarding age. Child Protective Services lawyers on May 13 told Judge Walther that Louisa and the mother of a boy born April 29 were no longer considered to be minors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,355484,00.html | title= Texas Concedes Sect Mother of Baby Born in State Custody Is Not a Minor | date= May 13, 2008 | publisher= [[Fox News Channel]] |agency= ([[Associated Press|AP]]) }}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 22, CPS declared half of the alleged teen mothers to be adults, some as old as 27. One who had been listed as an underage mother had never been pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://abcnews.go.com/TheLaw/wireStory?id=4908891 | title= Texas Officials: 15 Mothers Wrongly in Foster Care; Half of mothers thought to be underage in polygamist sect case are adults | first= Michelle | last= Roberts | publisher= [[ABC News]] |agency= ([[Associated Press|AP]]) | date= May 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other criticism====
Many FLDS members and supporters see the raid and the seizure of the children from their family as [[religious persecution]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/04/14/polygamy.retreat/ |title=Women return to Texas polygamist ranch |publisher=CNN |date=April 14, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423214750/http://www.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/04/14/polygamy.retreat/ |archivedate=April 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and have likened it to a [[witch-hunt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=4684344&amp;page=1 | title= Willie Jessop: Purported Frontman at Texas Polygamy Compound | publisher= [[ABC News]] | date= April 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2008, FLDS spokesperson [[Willie Jessop]] wrote a letter to President [[George W. Bush]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.captivefldschildren.org/Pres%20Bush%20Letter%205-10-08.pdf |format=PDF| title= Letter to President George W. Bush | publisher= captivefldschildren.org | date= May 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; asking him to intervene, and outlining the harsh conditions that Jessop believed that the children and mothers were subjected to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://deseretnews.com/article/1,5143,700224855,00.html | title= Letter asks Bush to help FLDS kids | first= Nancy | last= Perkins |newspaper= [[Deseret News]] | date= May 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the letter Jessop claimed that, contrary to statements from authorities that the children were being placed in a safe and secure environment, the mothers and children were actually crowded by the hundreds into Fort Concho, a military facility without adequate toilets, bathing facilities, or privacy.

Mental health workers who worked at the shelter testified similarly to state officials, also citing lack of privacy, only military cots for sleeping and poor-quality food, with no communications and threatened arrest if mothers waved to friends. "The CPS workers were openly rude to the mothers and children, yelled at them for trying to wave to friends ... threatened them with arrest if they did not stop waving"&lt;ref name=SLT-Caregivers&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.sltrib.com/polygamy/ci_9238520 | title= Caregivers blast Texas' treatment of polygamous sect's women, children | newspaper= [[Salt Lake Tribune]] | first= Julia | last= Lyon | date= May 13, 2008 | access-date= May 14, 2008 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080514024257/http://www.sltrib.com/polygamy/ci_9238520 | archive-date= May 14, 2008 | dead-url= yes | df= mdy-all }} &lt;br/&gt; Some quotes found in two of the original affidavits linked to from this article titled: [http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site297/2008/0512/20080512_043826_FLDS_10.pdf "This incident... is not what America or Texas stands for."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527193755/http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site297/2008/0512/20080512_043826_FLDS_10.pdf |date=May 27, 2008 }} and [http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site297/2008/0512/20080512_043931_FLDS_11.pdf "Even the simplest request was discounted."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527193748/http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site297/2008/0512/20080512_043931_FLDS_11.pdf |date=May 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Workers took notes on everything the "guests" said. In many of the testimonies it was compared to a prison or [[Concentration camps|concentration camp]]. Others testified the children were "amazingly clean, happy, healthy, energetic, well behaved and self-confident," while the mothers were "consistently calm, patient and loving with their children."

The Christian legal group [[Liberty Legal Institute]] believes the state of Texas should be required to prove that the children taken from the ranch were actually abused or were in imminent danger, warning of possible damage to religious liberties and the rights of all Texas parents. Home-schooling families were also fearful opponents could file similarly false complaints against families to force attendance in government-run schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.onenewsnow.com/Legal/Default.aspx?id=98496 | title= Caution urged in Texas sect case | first= Jeff | last= Johnson | publisher= [[Onenewsnow.com|OneNewsNow.com]] | date= May 7, 2008 | access-date= May 7, 2008 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080509173036/http://www.onenewsnow.com/Legal/Default.aspx?id=98496 | archive-date= May 9, 2008 | dead-url= yes | df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Utah [[Attorney General]] [[Mark Shurtleff]] disagreed with the removal:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Let's say you're a 6-month-old girl, no evidence whatsoever of any abuse. They're simply saying, 'You, in this culture, may grow up to be a child bride when you're 14. Therefore we're going to remove you now when you're 6 months old,'" he said. "Or, 'You're a 6-month-old boy; 25, 30 years, 40 years from now you're going to be a predator, so we're going to take you away now."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://deseretnews.com/article/1,5143,695276307,00.html | title= Utah, Arizona AGs feel fallout from FLDS raid |newspaper= [[Deseret News]] | first= Ben | last= Winslow | date= May 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Texas requires public education for children not in private or home schooling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.thsc.org/about_us/texlaws.asp | title= Texas Education Code Excerpt | publisher= Texas Home School Coalition | access-date= May 14, 2008 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080509092333/http://www.thsc.org/about_us/texlaws.asp | archive-date= May 9, 2008 | dead-url= yes | df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the children have not been schooled while in state custody, a [[Texas Education Agency]] spokesman has stated that "there's a point at which their educational input is secondary" to their emotional well-being.&lt;ref name=SLT-old_ways-new_homes&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.sltrib.com/news/ci_9148958 | title= FLDS children adapt old ways to new homes | newspaper= [[The Salt Lake Tribune]] | date= May 5, 2008 | author= Julia Lyon, Brooke Adams and Nate Carlisle | access-date= May 14, 2008 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080517012353/http://www.sltrib.com/news/ci_9148958 | archive-date= May 17, 2008 | dead-url= yes | df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; CPS anticipates that the children will continue their education on the campus of their foster placement.  There were no plans for the children to attend classes on any public school campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.dfps.state.tx.us/About/News/2008/2008-05-05_education.asp | title= CPS Working with TEA to Meet Educational Needs of Eldorado Children | publisher= [[Texas Department of Family and Protective Services]] | date= May 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[ACLU]] maintains that the raid was prompted by a single, unsubstantiated allegation of abuse, and they allege that all children at the ranch were believed at risk solely because of exposure to FLDS beliefs regarding underage marriage. But, the ACLU contends, "exposure to a religion's beliefs, however unorthodox, is not itself abuse and may not constitutionally be labeled abuse." The ACLU pointed out that parents were separated from their children without individual hearings and without particularized evidence of abuse, and that DNA testing was ordered without evidence that parentage was in dispute. Such actions, the ACLU asserts, "should not be indiscriminately targeted against a group as a whole – particularly when the group is perceived as being different or unusual."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.aclu.org/religion/gen/35123res20080502.html | title= ACLU Statement On The Government's Actions Regarding The Yearning For Zion Ranch In Eldorado, Texas | publisher= [[ACLU]] | date= May 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commentary===
At the beginning of May, ''[[National Review]]'' columnist [[John Derbyshire]] called the raid the "atrocity of the [previous] month", but said he had seen only one editorial critical of the removals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/224363/april-diary/john-derbyshire | title= April Diary: Atrocity of the month | last= Derbyshire | first= John | date= May 1, 2008 |publisher= [[National Review Online]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' editorially endorsed the appeals court decision, saying CPS "was overzealous in its efforts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/editorials/la-ed-polygamists23-2008may23,0,6188203.story |newspaper= Los Angeles Times |title= Polygamists presumed evil? |date= May 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several commentators compared the raid with the [[Short Creek raid]] of 1953, which was also a government raid on an [[Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints|FLDS]] community, and which led to a popular backlash against the raid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last= Adams | first= Brooke | url= http://www.sltrib.com/polygamy/ci_8887264 | title= Polygamous crackdown echoes 1953 Short Creek arrests | newspaper= [[The Salt Lake Tribune]] | date= April 11, 2008 | accessdate= April 18, 2008 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080412122404/http://www.sltrib.com/polygamy/ci_8887264 | archive-date= April 12, 2008 | dead-url= yes | df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.sltrib.com/polygamy/ci_8908639 | title= Polygamy: Where religious liberty ends | newspaper= [[The Salt Lake Tribune]] | date= April 13, 2008 | accessdate= April 18, 2008 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080414230940/http://www.sltrib.com/polygamy/ci_8908639 | archive-date= April 14, 2008 | dead-url= yes | df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://bangornews.com/news/t/viewpoints.aspx?articleid=164871&amp;zoneid=34 | title = Editorial: Shades of Short Creek | author = BDN Staff | date = May 28, 2008 | newspaper = [[Bangor Daily News]] | access-date = June 1, 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080624231045/http://bangornews.com/news/t/viewpoints.aspx?articleid=164871&amp;zoneid=34 | archive-date = June 24, 2008 | dead-url = yes | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-na-polygamist31-2008may31,0,5459251.story | title = FLDS raid appears to have backfired | author = Miguel Bustillo and Nicholas Riccardi (staff writers) | date = May 31, 2008 |newspaper= Los Angeles Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-raid events===
On April 14, 2008, the women and children were moved out of [[Fort Concho]] to San Angelo Coliseum, where the CPS reported that the children were playing and smiling.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} Mothers had complained about the living conditions inside Fort Concho, sending a letter to the Texas Governor asking him to investigate the conditions. In the letter, obtained by the Associated Press, the mothers claim that their children became sick and required hospitalization. They wrote "Our innocent children are continually being questioned on things they know nothing about. The physical examinations were horrifying to the children. The exposure to these conditions is traumatizing." FLDS and mental health workers complained about subjecting children to interrogation sessions, invasive physical examinations, pregnancy tests and complete body x-rays. Women staying at Fort Concho shelter told the press that the temporary housing was "cramped, with cots, cribs, and playpens lined up side by side, and that the children were frightened."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.wsws.org/articles/2008/apr2008/poly-a15.shtml | title= Court proceedings begin in Texas polygamy sect case| publisher= [[World Socialist Web Site]] ([[International Committee of the Fourth International]]) | first= Kate | last= Randall | date= April 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FLDS described the separation of mothers from their children as "inhumane". When the children under 5 realized their mothers would be taken away, the children started crying and screaming, requiring CPS workers to pry many from their mothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.sltrib.com/Polygamy/ci_9056589 | title= FLDS attorney challenges Texas count of pregnant minors from polygamous sect | first= Brooke | last= Adams | newspaper= [[The Salt Lake Tribune]] | date= April 26, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The children were placed in 16 group shelters and foster homes. Minors with children were sent to the Seton Home in San Antonio, older boys to Cal Farley's Boys Ranch in Amarillo. Some parents stated on the Today Show that they were unable to visit their boys due to a shortage of CPS staff. Newspapers released names of facilities caring for the FLDS children that have requested donations of specific items, help or cash.&lt;ref name= SLT-old_ways-new_homes /&gt;

On April 16, 2008, several of the mothers appeared on ''[[Larry King Live]]'' to ask for their children and tell their story from their own viewpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/us/2008/04/16/lkl.flds.polygamy.women.cnn | title= We need our children | publisher= CNN | date= April 16, 2008}} (Video clip)&lt;/ref&gt;  The program included a guided tour of the ranch by one of the mothers, showing where the children and families sleep and eat and stressing the loss felt with the children all now gone. The mothers declined to discuss the pending allegations of child abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/us/2008/04/16/lkl.flds.polygamy.cnn | title= Tour of polygamist compound | publisher= CNN | date= April 16, 2008}} (Video clip)&lt;/ref&gt; On the 17th, a custody hearing began in the [[Tom Green County, Texas|Tom Green County]] Courthouse to determine whether the children would remain in state custody.  Judge [[Barbara Walther]] heard testimony from State officials, experts called in by the State and witnesses for ranch members over a period of 2 days while hundreds of lawyers representing the children looked on and offered objections.  State officials alleged a pattern of abuse by adults, including marriages between young girls and older men, while ranch residents insisted that no abuse had taken place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2008/04/16/national/a003815D84.DTL | title= Sect members say life 'normal' on polygamous church ranch |newspaper= [[San Francisco Chronicle]] | date= April 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 18, 2008, after 21 hours of testimony, Judge Walther ordered that all 416 children seized be held in [[protective custody]] and that the [[DNA]] of the children and adults be [[DNA paternity testing|tested to establish family relationships]]. Children younger than 4 were to be separated from their mothers over 18 after DNA samples were taken; older children had already been separated. Children were to be given individual hearings to determine whether they must be moved to permanent [[foster care]] or returned to their parents.&lt;ref name= AP-parted /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/19/us/19raid.html?hp | title= Sect's children to be held in custody for now |newspaper= [[New York Times]] |date= April 19, 2008 | accessdate=April 19, 2008 | first1=Kirk | last1=Johnson | first2=John | last2=Dougherty}}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA testing of children and adults began on the 21st.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/life/religion/5715945.html | title= DNA tests to determine parentage in polygamist sect |newspaper= [[Houston Chronicle]] | date= April 21, 2008 | accessdate=April 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 24, 2008, authorities stated that they believed 25 mothers from the YFZ Ranch were under 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.deseretnews.com/article/1,5143,695273381,00.html | title= Number of children in Texas custody rises – some young mothers are actually under 18 | date= April 24, 2008 |newspaper= [[Deseret Morning News]] |accessdate=April 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the 28th, authorities announced that of the 53 girls aged 14–17, 31 have children or were pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/24356447 | title= Most teen girls from ranch have been pregnant | publisher= [[MSNBC]] |date= April 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the women regained custody of the children, one half of the families left the Yearning for Zion ranch and moved to another FLDS location.

Carey Cockerell, representing Texas CPS investigators, said on April 30 that they have identified 41 children with past diagnoses of fractured bones. FLDS spokesman Rod Parker attributes the fractures to hereditary bone disease and believes that the fracture rate was low, considering the children's physically active lifestyle. Additionally, two children broke bones while they were removed from the ranch, and one girl broke a bone while in custody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Texas officials looking at possible abuse among FLDS boys | url= http://www.ksl.com/?nid=148&amp;sid=3196825 | date= April 30, 2008 | publisher= [[KSL-TV]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; CPS investigators also made new allegations of possible sexual abuse of boys, citing their diary notes.

On May 13, 2008, a San Antonio judge allowed a couple from the ranch to have daily visits with their children, and granted them a hearing in 10 days to decide their children's custody.  Other challenges to the blanket order by Judge Walther were filed in courts in San Antonio, Austin, and San Angelo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/5777869.html | date= May 13, 2008 | title= Polygamist sect couple allowed to visit their children | first= Elizabeth  | last= Allen |newspaper= [[Houston Chronicle]] (in association with the ''[[San Antonio Express-News]]'') }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/TopStories/stories/MYSA.051408.1A.FLDS.38989e4.html | date= May 13, 2008 | title= Sect couple's visits with children OK'd | first= Elizabeth | last= Allen | newspaper= [[San Antonio Express-News]] (in association with the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'') | access-date= May 15, 2008 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080607120110/http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/TopStories/stories/MYSA.051408.1A.FLDS.38989e4.html | archive-date= June 7, 2008 | dead-url= yes | df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Elizabeth Allen of the San Antonio Express-News was given the byline on both of these articles, but wording of each was different, secondary attributions were different, and published separately by the two newspapers.--&gt;

In November 2008, 12 FLDS men were charged with offenses related to underage marriages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.gosanangelo.com/news/2008/nov/12/eight-more-indictments-issued-against-sect/ |title= Nine more indictments issued against FLDS members |newspaper= [[San Angelo Standard-Times]] |author= Paul Anthony |date= November 13, 2008 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120304185718/http://www.gosanangelo.com/news/2008/nov/12/eight-more-indictments-issued-against-sect/ |archivedate= March 4, 2012 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 22, 2008, The Texas Department of Family and Protective Services issued a 21-page final report on the raid entitled "El Dorado Investigation"  The report found that "12 girls were 'spiritually' married at ages ranging from 12 to 15, and seven of these girls have had one or more children. The 12 confirmed victims of sexual abuse were among 43 girls removed from the ranch from the ages of 12 to 17, which means that more than one out of every four pubescent girls on the ranch was in an underage marriage."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url= http://www.dfps.state.tx.us/documents/about/pdf/2008-12-22_Eldorado.pdf | title= El Dorado Investigation | publisher= Texas Department of Family and Protective Services | date= December 22, 2008 | accessdate =February 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Resolution====

A year after the raid, two thirds of the families were back at the ranch and sect leaders had promised to end [[marriageable age|underaged marriages]]. Twelve men, not all apparently from the ranch, had been indicted on a variety of sex charges, including assault and bigamy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://abcnews.go.com/TheLaw/story?id=7252149&amp;page=1#.Tz6F3FG2UeB |title= Polygamist Sect Marks First Anniversary of Texas Ranch Raid |first= Ryan |last= Owens |publisher= [[ABC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  One child, a 14-year-old girl who was married to jailed leader [[Warren Jeffs]] when she was 12, remained in [[foster care]].

==Seizure==
In November 2012, the Texas Attorney General's Office began legal proceeding in an attempt to seize the ranch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Richardson|first=Kent S.|title=The State of Texas v. 2420 County Road 300, Eldorado, Schleicher, County, Texas 76936: Plaintiff’s Original Notice of Seizure and Intended Forfeiture|url=https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/newspubs/releases/2012/121129signed_search_and_seizure.pdf|work=Cause No.: 3164|publisher=The State of Texas [[Texas Attorney General|Attorney General]]|accessdate=April 22, 2014|date=November 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reavy&gt;{{cite news|last=Reavy|first=Pat|title=Texas seeks to seize YFZ Ranch from FLDS Church|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865567677/Texas-seeks-to-seize-YFZ-Ranch-from-FLDS-Church.html?pg=all|accessdate=November 21, 2013|newspaper=[[Deseret News]]|date=November 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dalrymple&gt;{{cite news|last=Dalrymple II|first=Jim|title=Texas inches closer to seizing massive polygamous ranch|url=http://www.sltrib.com/csp/cms/sites/sltrib/pages/printerfriendly.csp?id=57147115|accessdate=November 21, 2013|newspaper=The Salt Lake Tribune|date=November 18, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228214602/http://www.sltrib.com/csp/cms/sites/sltrib/pages/printerfriendly.csp?id=57147115|archive-date=February 28, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a 91-page affidavit filed with the 51st District Court of Texas, the Attorney General argues that Warren Jeffs authorized the purchase of the ranch property as " ... a rural location where the systemic sexual assault of children would be tolerated without interference from law enforcement authorities",&lt;ref name=Reavy/&gt; therefore, the property was contraband and subject to seizure.&lt;ref name=Dalrymple/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Martinez|first=Sergeant Marcos|title=Affidavit for Search and Seizure Warrant|url=https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/newspubs/releases/2012/121129signed_affidavit.pdf|work=Cause No.: 3164|publisher=The State of Texas [[Texas Attorney General|Attorney General]]|accessdate=April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Texas law, property that was used to commit or facilitate certain criminal conduct can be seized by law enforcement authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=State of Texas Files Legal Action to Seize West Texas Ranch Where Warren Jeffs and Sect Members Sexually Assaulted Children|url=https://www.oag.state.tx.us/oagnews/release.php?id=4232|publisher=Texas Attorney General's Office|accessdate=November 21, 2013|date=November 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 the property was appraised to have a value of $19.96 million, according to county tax rolls.&lt;ref name=Dalrymple/&gt;

On January 6, 2014, Judge Walther ruled that the state could seize the property, and that they could "enter the property and take an inventory."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= What's the Next Chapter for the FLDS Ranch? |url= http://www.texasmonthly.com/story/whats-next-chapter-flds-ranch |first= Katy |last= Vine |date= February 5, 2014 |journal= [[Texas Monthly]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first= Jennifer |last= Rios |date= January 8, 2014 |title= Former FLDS ranch forfeited to state |url= http://www.gosanangelo.com/news/2014/jan/08/yfz-ranch-forfeited-to-state/ |newspaper= San Angelo Standard-Times |access-date= February 28, 2014 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140113202539/http://www.gosanangelo.com/news/2014/jan/08/yfz-ranch-forfeited-to-state/ |archive-date= January 13, 2014 |dead-url= yes |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The FLDS Church had 30 days to appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Clock ticking for YFZ Ranch owners |url= http://www.gosanangelo.com/news/2014/jan/11/yfz-ranch-clock-ticking/ |newspaper= San Angelo Standard-Times |date= January 11, 2014 |access-date= February 28, 2014 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140228214716/http://www.gosanangelo.com/news/2014/jan/11/yfz-ranch-clock-ticking/ |archive-date= February 28, 2014 |dead-url= yes |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 6, 2014, at the close of the courthouse day, the opportunity to appeal the seizure expired; since no one had filed an appeal challenging the seizure by that time, the state of Texas became the legal owner of the YFZ Ranch.

Karen Fjelstad and Nguyen Thi Hien. (Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell Southeast Asia Program, 2006), 19-30.&lt;/ref&gt; These include the worship of goddesses such as [[Thiên Y A Na]], The Lady of the Realm ([[Bà Chúa Xứ]]), The Lady of the Storehouse ([[Bà Chúa Kho]]) and Princess [[Liễu Hạnh]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}.&lt;/ref&gt; legendary figures like [[Âu Cơ]], the [[Trung Sisters]] (Hai Bà Trưng), and Lady Trieu ([[Bà Triệu]]), as well as the cult of the Four Palaces. Đạo Mẫu is commonly associated with [[mediumship|spirit mediumship]] rituals—known in Vietnam as ''[[lên đồng]]''—much as practiced in other parts of Asia, such as Southern China, [[Myanmar]] ([[Mon people]]) and some community in [[India]]... Although the Communist government had initially proscribed the practice of such rituals, deeming them to be superstitions, they relented in 1987, once again legalizing their practice.

==Cult of Four Palaces==
The cult of Four Palaces (Tứ Phủ) worships a hierarchical pantheon of Taoist gods, Buddhist and historical figures. They included:
===Trinity of Goddesses (Tam Tòa Thánh Mẫu)=== 
*[[Liễu Hạnh|Sky Goddess]] (Mẫu Thượng Thiên) 
*[[Mẫu Thượng Ngàn|Forest Goddess]] (Mẫu Thượng Ngàn) 
*[[Mẫu Thoải|Sea Goddess]] (Mẫu Thoải) 

===Rank of Officials (Hàng Quan)=== 
===Rank of Ladies (hàng Chầu Bà)=== 
===Rank of Princes (hàng Ông Hoàng)=== 
Ten Princes are mythical or historical figures. 
===Rank of Gentlemen and Maidens (hàng Cô, Cậu)=== 
===Rank of Five Tigers and ông Lốt (Naga)===
