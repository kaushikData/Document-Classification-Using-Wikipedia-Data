'''Abu Ja'far Muhammad''' ({{lang-fa|ابو جعفر محمد}}), was the ruler of the [[Bavand dynasty]] from an unknown date until his capture and defeat by the [[Kakuyids]] in 1027.

== Background ==
In 1006, the Bavand dynasty was put to an end by the [[Ziyarid dynasty|Ziyarid]] ruler [[Qabus]] (r. 977–981 &amp; 997–1012).{{sfn|Frye|1986|p=1110}} Nevertheless, several Bavandid princes continued to rule in small local parts of [[Mazandaran]]. Abu Ja'far, a son of a certain Vandarin, is mentioned as the ruler of Bavand dynasty. It is not known if Abu Ja'far was the successor of Al-Marzuban or not. Abu Ja'far, during his reign, was a vassal of the [[Buyid]] ruler [[Majd al-Dawla]] (r. 997–1029), who was himself of Bavandid descent through his mother [[Sayyida Khatun]].

== Reign ==
[[Ibn Fuladh]], a [[Daylamites|Daylamite]] military officer, who claimed [[Qazvin]] for himself, revolted against Majd al-Dawla in 1016. Majd al-Dawla, however, refused to make him governor of Qazvin, which made Ibn Fuladh threaten him around the countryside of his capital in [[Ray, Iran|Ray]]. Majd al-Dawla then requested the aid of Abu Ja'far, who managed to defeat Ibn Fuladh and repel him from Ray. Ibn Fuladh then requested aid from the Ziyarid ruler [[Manuchihr]] (r. 1012–1031). Ibn Fuladh agreed to become Manuchihr's vassal in return for his aid. The following year, a combined army of Ibn Fuladh and Manuchihr besieged Ray, which forced Majd al-Dawla to make Ibn Fuladh the governor of [[Isfahan]].

In 1023, the [[Kakuyids|Kakuyid]] ruler [[Muhammad ibn Rustam Dushmanziyar]] (r. 1008-1041), who was himself of Bavandid descent, revolted against the Buyids, and seized [[Hamadan]] from the Buyid ruler [[Sama' al-Dawla]] (r. 1021-1023).{{sfn|Bosworth|1998|p=359-362}} He spent the following years in protecting his realm from invasions by the forces of Abu Ja'far. Five years later, Majd al-Dawla sent a combined Buyid-Bavandid army under Abu Ja'far and his two sons against Muhammad. Muhammad, however, managed win a great victory over the Buyid-Bavandid army at [[Nahavand]], and managed to capture Abu Ja'far including his two sons. Abu Ja'far died one year later in prison, and after his death, the Bavandids disappears from sources, and are first later mentioned in 1057 under the Bavandid ruler [[Qarin II]].

== The ''Mil-e Radkan'' ==
During his reign, Abu Ja'far ordered the construction of the ''Mil-e Radkan'' near [[Gorgan]], where he was later buried. The building of the tower was completed in 1016, between 7 September-5 October—several inscriptions are written on the entrance, both in [[Arabic]] and [[Middle Persian|Pahlavi]], which states;

{{quote|text=In the name of God. This is the palace of the amir, the important lord, Abu Ja'far Muhammad ibn Vandarin Bavand, client of the Commander of the Faithful. [It was ordered] in the month of Rabi II of the year 407 [7 September-5 October 1016].{{sfn|Babaie|Grigor|2015|p=150}}}}

Another inscription, states the following; 

{{quote|text=In the name of God. The ''[[ispahbad]]'' Abu Ja'far Muhammad ibn Vandarin Bavand, client of the Commander of the Faithful, may God honour him with forgiveness and satisfaction and paradise, ordered commencing the construction of this shrine during the days of [his] life in 407 [1016-1017]. It was finished in the year 411 of the ''[[hegira]]'' [1020-1021].{{sfn|Babaie|Grigor|2015|p=150}}}}

'''Allmänna BB''' (''Allmänna barnbördshuset'', "General maternity hospital", literally ''The general childbirth house'') was a [[maternity hospital]] in [[Stockholm]], Sweden. The hospital was inaugurated on February 20, 1775 on [[Riddarholmen]]. In 1785 the hospital moved to [[Östermalm]] and in 1795 changed its name to Allmänna barnbördshuset. In 1885 the hospital moved to [[Kungsholmen]], but as the facilities became inadequate the hospital moved once again to use the former barracks used to house the athletes during the 1912 [[1912 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympic Games]]. The new facilities were first used on January 5, 1913. Due to a decline in childbirths Allmänna BB was closed shortly after celebrating its 200th anniversary. The former facilities are presently used by the [[Royal Institute of Technology]].

== Early life ==

=== Childhood ===

[[File:ameliachild.jpg|left|thumb|Earhart as a child]]

Earhart was the daughter of Samuel "Edwin" Stanton Earhart (1867–1930) and Amelia "Amy" ({{née|[[Otis family|Otis]]}}; 1869–1962).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060901135618/http://oasis.harvard.edu:10080/oasis/deliver/~sch00228 "A/E11/M-129, Earhart, Amy Otis, 1869–1962.

Amelia was the second child of the marriage, after an infant was stillborn in August 1896.{{sfn|Goldstein|Dillon|1997|p=8}} She was of part [[German American|German]] descent. Alfred Otis had not initially favored the marriage and was not satisfied with Edwin's progress as a lawyer.{{sfn|Goldstein|Dillon|1997|p=9}}

According to family custom, Earhart was named after her two grandmothers, Amelia Josephine Harres and Mary Wells Patton.{{sfn|Goldstein|Dillon|1997|p=8}} From an early age, Amelia was the ringleader while her sister Grace Muriel Earhart (1899–1998), two years her junior, acted as the dutiful follower.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ninety-nines.org/grace-muriel-earhart-morrissey.htm "Grace Muriel Earhart Morrissey."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151130001159/http://www.ninety-nines.org/grace-muriel-earhart-morrissey.htm |date=November 30, 2015 }} ''The Ninety-Nines''.

=== Early influence ===

A spirit of adventure seemed to abide in the Earhart children, with the pair setting off daily to explore their neighborhood.{{refn|Quote: "... the judge nevertheless adored his brave and intelligent granddaughter and in her [Earhart's] love of adventure, she seemed to have inherited his pioneering spirit."{{sfn|Randolph|1987|p=16}}|group=Note}} As a child, Earhart spent long hours playing with sister Pidge, climbing trees, hunting rats with a rifle and "belly-slamming" her sled downhill.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120412224805/http://www-tc.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/media/uploads/special_features/download_files/amelia_transcript.pdf "American Experience: Amelia Earhart Program Transcript."] ''americanexperience'', April 12, 2012. Retrieved: September 23, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the love of the outdoors and "rough-and-tumble" play was common to many youngsters, some biographers have characterized the young Earhart as a [[tomboy]].{{sfn|Rich|1989|p=4}} The girls kept "worms, moths, [[Tettigoniidae|katydids]] and a tree toad"{{sfn|Lovell|1989|p=14}} in a growing collection gathered in their outings. In 1904, with the help of her uncle, she cobbled together a home-made ramp fashioned after a roller coaster she had seen on a trip to [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] and secured the ramp to the roof of the family toolshed. Earhart's well-documented first flight ended dramatically. She emerged from the broken wooden box that had served as a sled with a bruised lip, torn dress and a "sensation of exhilaration". She exclaimed, "Oh, Pidge, it's just like flying!"{{sfn|Goldstein|Dillon|1997|p=9}}

Although there had been some missteps in Edwin Earhart's career up to that point, in 1907 his job as a claims officer for the [[Rock Island Railroad]] led to a transfer to [[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines]], Iowa. The next year, at the age of 10,&lt;ref name="Biography"&gt;[http://www.ameliaearhart.com/about/bio.html "Biography.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525154635/http://www.ameliaearhart.com/about/bio.html |date=May 25, 2012 }} ''The Official Website of Amelia Earhart (The Family of Amelia Earhart)''.

=== Education ===

The two sisters, Amelia and Muriel (she went by her middle name from her teens on), remained with their grandparents in Atchison, while their parents moved into new, smaller quarters in Des Moines. During this period, Earhart received a form of home-schooling together with her sister, from her mother and a governess. She later recounted that she was "exceedingly fond of reading"{{sfn|Hamill|1976|p=51}} and spent countless hours in the large family library. In 1909, when the family was finally reunited in Des Moines, the Earhart children were enrolled in public school for the first time with Amelia Earhart entering the seventh grade at the age of 12 years.

=== Family fortunes ===

[[File:Amelia-in-evening-clothes (cropped).jpg|thumb|Earhart in evening clothes]]

While the family's finances seemingly improved with the acquisition of a new house and even the hiring of two servants, it soon became apparent that Edwin was an alcoholic. Five years later in 1914, he was forced to retire and although he attempted to rehabilitate himself through treatment, he was never reinstated at the Rock Island Railroad. At about this time, Earhart's grandmother Amelia Otis died suddenly, leaving a substantial estate that placed her daughter's share in a trust, fearing that Edwin's drinking would drain the funds. The Otis house was auctioned along with all of its contents; Earhart was heartbroken and later described it as the end of her childhood.{{sfn|Garst|1947|p=35}}

In 1915, after a long search, Earhart's father found work as a clerk at the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]] in St. Paul, Minnesota, where Earhart entered [[Central High School (Saint Paul, Minnesota)|Central High School]] as a junior. Edwin applied for a transfer to [[Springfield, Missouri|Springfield]], Missouri, in 1915 but the current claims officer reconsidered his retirement and demanded his job back, leaving the elder Earhart with nowhere to go. Facing another calamitous move, Amy Earhart took her children to Chicago, where they lived with friends. Earhart made an unusual condition in the choice of her next schooling; she canvassed nearby high schools in Chicago to find the best science program. She rejected the high school nearest her home when she complained that the chemistry lab was "just like a kitchen sink".{{sfn|Blau|1977|pp=10–11}} She eventually enrolled in [[Hyde Park Career Academy|Hyde Park High School]] but spent a miserable semester where a yearbook caption captured the essence of her unhappiness, "A.E. – the girl in brown who walks alone".{{sfn|Rich|1989|p=11}}

Earhart graduated from Chicago's Hyde Park High School in 1916.{{sfn|Long|Long|1999|p=33}} Throughout her troubled childhood, she had continued to aspire to a future career; she kept a scrapbook of newspaper clippings about successful women in predominantly male-oriented fields, including film direction and production, law, advertising, management and mechanical engineering.&lt;ref name="Biography" /&gt; She began junior college at [[Penn State Abington|Ogontz School]] in [[Rydal, Pennsylvania|Rydal]], Pennsylvania, but did not complete her program.{{sfn|Kerby|1990|pp=18–19}}{{refn|Although a good student, Earhart cut short her time at Ogontz when she became a nursing assistant in Canada.|group=Note}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://libraries.psu.edu/about/collections/ogontz-school-1850-1950/outstanding-alumnae|title=Outstanding Alumnae|date=2016-09-12|work=Penn State University Libraries|access-date=2018-09-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Christmas vacation in 1917, Earhart visited her sister in [[Toronto]]. [[World War I]] had been raging and Earhart saw the returning wounded soldiers. After receiving training as a [[Certified Nursing Assistant|nurse's aide]] from the [[Red Cross]], she began work with the [[Voluntary Aid Detachment]] at [[1 Spadina Crescent|Spadina Military Hospital]].

=== Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 ===

When the 1918 [[Spanish flu]] pandemic reached Toronto, Earhart was engaged in arduous nursing duties that included night shifts at the Spadina Military Hospital.{{sfn|Lovell|1989|p=27}}{{sfn|Earhart|1932|p=21}} She became a patient herself, suffering from pneumonia and [[Maxillary sinus|maxillary]] [[sinusitis]].{{sfn|Lovell|1989|p=27}} She was hospitalized in early November 1918, owing to pneumonia, and discharged in December 1918, about two months after the illness had started.{{sfn|Lovell|1989|p=27}} Her [[sinus (anatomy)|sinus]]-related symptoms were pain and pressure around one eye and copious mucus drainage via the nostrils and throat.{{sfn|Backus|1982|pp=49–50}} While staying in the hospital during the pre-antibiotic era, she had painful minor operations to wash out the affected maxillary sinus,{{sfn|Lovell|1989|p=27}}{{sfn|Earhart|1932|p=21}}{{sfn|Backus|1982|pp=49–50}} but these procedures were not successful and Earhart subsequently suffered from worsening headaches. Her convalescence lasted nearly a year, which she spent at her sister's home in [[Northampton, Massachusetts|Northampton]], Massachusetts.{{sfn|Earhart|1932|p=21}} She passed the time by reading poetry, learning to play the banjo and studying mechanics.{{sfn|Lovell|1989|p=27}} Chronic sinusitis significantly affected Earhart's flying and activities in later life,{{sfn|Backus|1982|pp=49–50}} and sometimes even on the airfield she was forced to wear a bandage on her cheek to cover a small drainage tube.{{sfn|Rich|1989|pp=31–32}}

=== Early flying experiences ===

At about that time, Earhart and a young woman friend visited an air fair held in conjunction with the [[Canadian National Exhibition]] in Toronto. One of the highlights of the day was a flying exhibition put on by a World War I [[Flying ace|ace]].{{sfn|Earhart|1937|p=2}} The pilot overhead spotted Earhart and her friend, who were watching from an isolated clearing, and dived at them. "I am sure he said to himself, 'Watch me make them scamper,'" she said. Earhart stood her ground as the aircraft came close. "I did not understand it at the time," she said, "but I believe that little red airplane said something to me as it swished by."{{sfn|Earhart|1937|p=3}}

By 1919 Earhart prepared to enter [[Smith College]] but changed her mind and enrolled at [[Columbia University]], in a course in medical studies among other programs.{{sfn|Thames|1989|p=7}} She quit a year later to be with her parents, who had reunited in California.

[[File:Neta amelia kinner airster s.jpg|thumb|left|[[Neta Snook]] and Amelia Earhart in front of Earhart's [[Kinner Airster]], {{circa|1921}}]]

In [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], on December 28, 1920, Earhart and her father visited an airfield where [[Frank Hawks]] (who later gained fame as an [[air racing|air racer]]) gave her a ride that would forever change Earhart's life. "By the time I had got two or three hundred feet [60–90&amp;nbsp;m] off the ground," she said, "I knew I had to fly."{{sfn|Earhart|1937|p=4}} After that 10-minute flight (which cost her father $10), she immediately determined to learn to fly. Working at a variety of jobs including photographer, truck driver, and [[stenographer]] at the local telephone company, she managed to save $1,000 for flying lessons. Earhart had her first lesson on January 3, 1921, at Kinner Field near Long Beach. Her teacher was [[Neta Snook|Anita "Neta" Snook]], a pioneer female aviator who used a surplus [[Curtiss JN-4]] "Canuck" for training. Earhart arrived with her father and a singular request: "I want to fly. Will you teach me?"{{sfn|Marshall|2007|p=21}} In order to reach the airfield, Earhart had to take a bus to the end of the line, then walk four miles (6&amp;nbsp;km). Earhart's mother also provided part of the $1,000 "stake" against her "better judgement".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aviationhistory.org/ah_Amelia_Earhart.html "Lady Lindy, Amelia Earhart's life history."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205024527/http://aviationhistory.org/ah_Amelia_Earhart.html |date=December 5, 2006 }} ''aviationhistory.org''. Retrieved: October 12, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Earhart's commitment to flying required her to accept the frequent hard work and rudimentary conditions that accompanied early aviation training. She chose a leather jacket, but aware that other aviators would be judging her, she slept in it for three nights to give the jacket a "worn" look. To complete her image transformation, she also cropped her hair short in the style of other female flyers.{{sfn|Blau|1977|pp=15–16}} Six months later, Earhart purchased a secondhand bright yellow [[Kinner Airster]] [[biplane]] she nicknamed "The Canary". On October 22, 1922, Earhart flew the Airster to an altitude of {{convert|14000|ft|m}}, setting a world record for female pilots. On May 15, 1923, Earhart became the 16th woman in the United States to be issued a pilot's license (#''6017''){{sfn|Long|Long|1999|p=36}} by the [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale]] (FAI).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h1658.html "Aerospace: Amelia Earhart 1897–1937."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061113084605/http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h1658.html |date=November 13, 2006 }} ''U-S-History.com''.

=== Financial crisis ===

Throughout the early 1920s, following a disastrous investment in a failed [[gypsum]] mine, Earhart's inheritance from her grandmother, which was now administered by her mother, steadily diminished until it was exhausted. Consequently, with no immediate prospects for recouping her investment in flying, Earhart sold the "Canary" as well as a second Kinner and bought a yellow [[Kissel Motor Car Company|Kissel]] "Speedster" two-passenger automobile, which she named the "Yellow Peril". Simultaneously, Earhart experienced an exacerbation of her old sinus problem as her pain worsened and in early 1924 she was hospitalized for another sinus operation, which was again unsuccessful. After trying her hand at a number of unusual ventures that included setting up a photography company, Earhart set out in a new direction.{{sfn|Goldstein|Dillon|1997|p=33}}

=== Boston ===

Following her parents' divorce in 1924, she drove her mother in the "Yellow Peril" on a transcontinental trip from California with stops throughout the West and even a jaunt up to [[Banff, Alberta]]. The meandering tour eventually brought the pair to [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], where Earhart underwent another sinus operation which was more successful. After recuperation, she returned to Columbia University for several months but was forced to abandon her studies and any further plans for enrolling at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], because her mother could no longer afford the tuition fees and associated costs. Soon after, she found employment first as a teacher, then as a [[social worker]] in 1925 at [[Denison House (Boston)|Denison House]], a Boston [[Settlement movement|settlement house]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080401003450/http://www.lib.purdue.edu/spcol/aearhart/biog.php "Amelia Earhart Biographical Sketch".] ''George Palmer Putnam Collection of Amelia Earhart Papers'', Purdue University, April 1, 2008.

After [[Charles Lindbergh]]'s solo flight across the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] in 1927, Amy Guest (1873–1959) expressed interest in being the first woman to fly (or be flown) across the Atlantic Ocean. After deciding that the trip was too perilous for her to undertake, she offered to sponsor the project, suggesting that they find "another girl with the right image". While at work one afternoon in April 1928, Earhart got a phone call from Capt. Hilton H. Railey, who asked her, "Would you like to fly the Atlantic?"

The project coordinators (including book publisher and publicist [[George P. Putnam]]) interviewed Earhart and asked her to accompany pilot [[Wilmer Stultz]] and copilot/mechanic Louis Gordon on the flight, nominally as a passenger, but with the added duty of keeping the flight log. The team departed from [[Trepassey, Newfoundland and Labrador|Trepassey Harbor]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], in a [[Fokker F.VII]]b/3m on June 17, 1928, landing at [[Pwll]] near [[Burry Port]], South Wales, exactly 20 hours and 40 minutes later.{{sfn|Bryan|1979|p=132}} There is a commemorative [[blue plaque]] at the site.&lt;ref&gt;Dorrell, Richard.

She added, "... maybe someday I'll try it alone."{{sfn|Goldstein|Dillon|1997|p=54}}

Meanwhile, Putnam had undertaken to heavily promote her in a campaign that included publishing a book she authored, a series of new lecture tours and using pictures of her in mass market endorsements for products including luggage, [[Lucky Strike]] cigarettes (this caused image problems for her, with ''[[McCall's]]'' magazine retracting an offer){{sfn|Pearce|1988|p=76}} and women's clothing and sportswear. The money that she made with "Lucky Strike" had been earmarked for a $1,500 donation to Commander [[Richard Evelyn Byrd|Richard Byrd]]'s imminent South Pole expedition.{{sfn|Pearce|1988|p=76}}

The marketing campaign by both Earhart and Putnam was successful in establishing the Earhart mystique in the public psyche.&lt;ref&gt;Crouch, Tom D.

=== Promoting aviation ===

Celebrity endorsements helped Earhart finance her flying.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ameliaearhartmuseum.org/ "Biography of Amelia Earhart."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205052158/http://ameliaearhartmuseum.org/ |date=December 5, 2006 }} ''Amelia Earhart Birthplace Museum''.

She was a Vice President of National Airways, which conducted the flying operations of the Boston-Maine Airways and several other airlines in the northeast.&lt;ref&gt;''Boston and Maine Railroad Employees Magazine'', Volume 8, Number 10, July 1933, copy in Purdue University Special Collections.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1940, it had become [[Northeast Airlines]].

=== Competitive flying ===

Although Earhart had gained fame for her transatlantic flight, she endeavored to set an "untarnished" record of her own.{{sfn|Rich|1989|p=73}} Shortly after her return, piloting Avian ''7083'', she set off on her first long solo flight that occurred just as her name was coming into the national spotlight. By making the trip in August 1928, Earhart became the first woman to fly solo across the North American continent and back.&lt;ref name="Mendieta"&gt;Mendieta, Carlene.

Retrieved: May 21, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Her piloting skills and professionalism gradually grew, as acknowledged by experienced professional pilots who flew with her. General Leigh Wade flew with Earhart in 1929: "She was a born flier, with a delicate touch on the stick."{{sfn|Rich|1989|p=85}}

Earhart subsequently made her first attempt at competitive air racing in 1929 during the first Santa Monica-to-Cleveland [[Women's Air Derby]] (nicknamed the "Powder Puff Derby" by [[Will Rogers]]), which left Santa Monica on August 18 and arrived at Cleveland on August 26. During the race, she settled into fourth place in the "heavy planes" division. At the second last stop at Columbus, her friend [[Ruth Nichols]], who was coming third, had an accident while on a test flight before the race recommenced. Nichols' aircraft hit a tractor at the start of the runway and flipped over, forcing her out of the race.{{sfn|Lauber|1989|p=47}} At Cleveland, Earhart was placed third in the heavy division.{{sfn|Jessen|2002|p=193}}&lt;ref&gt;''San Bernardino County Sun''.

During this period, Earhart became involved with The [[Ninety-Nines]], an organization of female pilots providing moral support and advancing the cause of women in aviation. She had called a meeting of female pilots in 1929 following the Women's Air Derby. She suggested the name based on the number of the charter members; she later became the organization's first president in 1930.{{sfn|Lovell|1989|p=152}} Earhart was a vigorous advocate for female pilots and when the 1934 [[Bendix Trophy Race]] banned women, she openly refused to fly screen actress [[Mary Pickford]] to Cleveland to open the races.{{sfn|Oakes|1985|p=31}}

=== Marriage to George Putnam ===

[[File:Amelia Earhart and husband George Putnam 1931.jpg|thumb|left|Earhart and Putnam in 1931]]

Earhart was engaged to Samuel Chapman, a chemical engineer from Boston; she broke off the engagement on November 23, 1928.{{sfn|Lovell|1989|pp=130, 138}} During the same period, Earhart and publisher [[George P.

Earhart's ideas on marriage were liberal for the time as she believed in equal responsibilities for both breadwinners and pointedly kept her own name rather than being referred to as "Mrs. Putnam". When ''The New York Times'', per the rules of its stylebook, insisted on referring to her as Mrs. Putnam, she laughed it off. Putnam also learned that he would be called "Mr. Earhart".{{sfn|Pearce|1988|p=82}} There was no honeymoon for the newlyweds as Earhart was involved in a nine-day cross-country tour promoting autogyros and the tour sponsor, [[Beech-Nut]] chewing gum.

Through contacts in the Los Angeles aviation community, [[Fred Noonan]] was subsequently chosen as a second [[flight officer|navigator]] because there were significant additional factors that had to be dealt with while using celestial navigation for aircraft.{{sfn|Long|Long|1999|p=65}}{{sfn|Post|Gatty|1931|pp=45–56}} He had vast experience in both marine (he was a licensed ship's captain) and [[air navigation|flight navigation]].

On March 17, 1937, Earhart and her crew flew the first leg from [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], California to [[Honolulu]], Hawaii. In addition to Earhart and Noonan, Harry Manning and Mantz (who was acting as Earhart's technical advisor) were on board. Due to lubrication and galling problems with the propeller hubs' variable pitch mechanisms, the aircraft needed servicing in Hawaii. Ultimately, the Electra ended up at the United States Navy's Luke Field on [[Ford Island]] in [[Pearl Harbor]]. The flight resumed three days later from Luke Field with Earhart, Noonan and Manning on board. During the takeoff run, there was an uncontrolled [[ground loop (aviation)|ground-loop]], the forward landing gear collapsed, both propellers hit the ground, the plane skidded on its belly, and a portion of the runway was damaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://tighar.org/Projects/Earhart/Archives/Documents/Luke_Field_Crash_Report/LukeFieldProceedings.htm |title = Archived copy |accessdate = November 30, 2017 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171201041705/https://tighar.org/Projects/Earhart/Archives/Documents/Luke_Field_Crash_Report/LukeFieldProceedings.htm |archivedate = December 1, 2017 |df = mdy-all }} Crash description: "As the airplane gathered speed it swung slightly to the right. Miss Earhart corrected this tendency by throttling the left hand motor. The airplane then began to swing to the left with increasing speed, characteristic of a ground-loop. It tilted outward, right wing low and for 50 or 60 feet was supported on the right wheel only. The right-hand landing-gear suddenly collapsed under this excessive load followed by the left. The airplane spun sharply to the left sliding on its belly and amid a shower of sparks from the mat and came to rest headed about 200 degrees from it's {{sic}} initial course." Finding: "the airplane crashed on the landing mat due to the collapse of the landing gear as the result of an uncontrolled ground loop; that lack of factual evidence makes it impossible to establish the reason for the ground loop".&lt;/ref&gt; The cause of the ground-loop is controversial. Some witnesses at Luke Field, including the Associated Press journalist, said they saw a tire blow.{{sfn|Rich|1989|p=245}} Earhart thought either the Electra's right tire had blown and/or the right landing gear had collapsed. Some sources, including Mantz, cited pilot error.{{sfn|Rich|1989|p=245}}

With the aircraft severely damaged, the flight was called off and the aircraft was shipped by sea to the Lockheed Burbank facility for repairs.{{sfn|Leder|1989|p=48}}

=== Second attempt ===

[[File:Amelia Earhart flight route.svg|right|thumb|The planned flight route]]

While the Electra was being repaired Earhart and Putnam secured additional funds and prepared for a second attempt. This time flying west to east, the second attempt began with an unpublicized flight from Oakland to [[Miami]], Florida, and after arriving there Earhart publicly announced her plans to circumnavigate the globe. The flight's opposite direction was partly the result of changes in global wind and weather patterns along the planned route since the earlier attempt. On this second flight, Fred Noonan was Earhart's only crew member. The pair departed Miami on June 1 and after numerous stops in South America, Africa, the [[Indian subcontinent]] and Southeast Asia, arrived at [[Lae]], [[Territory of New Guinea|New Guinea]], on June 29, 1937. At this stage about 22,000 miles (35,000&amp;nbsp;km) of the journey had been completed. The remaining 7,000 miles (11,000&amp;nbsp;km) would be over the Pacific.

=== Departure from Lae ===

On &lt;time datetime="1937-07-02T00:00Z"&gt;July 2, 1937, midnight [[GMT]]&lt;/time&gt;, Earhart and Noonan took off from [[Lae Airfield]] ({{Coord|06|43|59|S|146|59|45|E|type:airport}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://gc.kls2.com/airport/AYLA.OLD Lae Airfield (AYLA)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018133354/http://gc.kls2.com/airport/AYLA.OLD |date=October 18, 2012 }} at Great Circle Mapper&lt;/ref&gt; in the heavily loaded Electra. Their intended destination was [[Howland Island]] ({{Coord|0|48|24|N|176|36|59|W|type:isle_region:UM-84|display=inline,title}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite gnis |id = 1393033 he|name = Howland Island |accessdate = February 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a flat sliver of land 6,500&amp;nbsp;ft (2,000&amp;nbsp;m) long and 1,600&amp;nbsp;ft (500&amp;nbsp;m) wide, 10&amp;nbsp;ft (3&amp;nbsp;m) high and {{convert|2556|mi|nmi km}} away.{{refn|From the given coordinates, the great circle distance is {{convert|4124|km|mi nmi}}. See http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html|group=Note}}

The aircraft departed Lae with about 1100 gallons of gasoline.{{sfn|Chater|1937}} In March 1937, [[Kelly Johnson (engineer)|Kelly Johnson]] had recommended engine and altitude settings for the Electra. One of the recommended schedules was:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://tighar.org/Publications/TTracks/2001Vol_17/johnson.pdf |title = The Kelly Johnson Telegrams |accessdate = November 22, 2017 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130124152117/http://tighar.org/Publications/TTracks/2001Vol_17/johnson.pdf |archivedate = January 24, 2013 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Initially, Johnson recommended a more efficient flight plan that had a lower altitude for the first 6 hours. {{harvtxt|Long|Long|1999|pp=68, 72}} shows that the flight to Honolulu would overtake a Pan Am flight that left earlier. To avoid problems, Earhart would fly at 8,000 feet while the slower Pan Am flight would stay below 6,000 feet. Johnson was asked to adapt the plan for 8,000 feet. The given schedule is for the 8,000-foot altitude, but Earhart may have used the slightly more efficient first schedule or some other schedule.|group=Note}}

Earhart used part of the above schedule for the Oakland to Honolulu leg of the first world flight attempt. Johnson estimated that 900 gallons of fuel would provide 40% more range than required for that leg. Using 900 gallons was 250 gallons less than the Electra's maximum fuel tank capacity; that meant a weight savings of {{convert|{{#expr:250*6}}|lb|kg}}, so Earhart included Mantz as a passenger on that leg. The Oakland to Honolulu leg had Earhart, Noonan, Manning, and Mantz on board. The flight from Oakland to Honolulu took 16 hours.&lt;ref name="radio" /&gt; The Electra also loaded 900 gallons of fuel for the shorter Honolulu to Howland leg (with only Earhart, Noonan, and Manning on board), but the airplane crashed on take off; the crash ended the first world flight attempt.&lt;ref&gt;Luke Field Crash Report, {{cite web |url = https://tighar.org/Projects/Earhart/Archives/Documents/Luke_Field_Crash_Report/LukeFieldProceedings.htm |title = Archived copy |accessdate = November 30, 2017 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171201041705/https://tighar.org/Projects/Earhart/Archives/Documents/Luke_Field_Crash_Report/LukeFieldProceedings.htm |archivedate = December 1, 2017 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around &lt;time datetime="1937-07-02T15:00+10:00"&gt;3&amp;nbsp;pm Lae time&lt;/time&gt;, Earhart reported her altitude as 10000 feet but that they would reduce altitude due to thick clouds. Around &lt;time datetime="1937-07-02T17:00+10:00"&gt;5&amp;nbsp;pm&lt;/time&gt;, Earhart reported her altitude as 7000 feet and speed as 150 knots.{{sfn|Collopy|1937}}

Their last known position report was near the [[Nukumanu Islands]], about {{convert|800|mi|nmi km}} into the flight.

During the flight, Noonan may have been able to do some [[celestial navigation]] to determine his position. The plane would cross the [[International Dateline]] during the flight; failing to account for the dateline could account for a 1° or 60 mile position error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.datelinetheory.com/p/effects-of-date-line.html |title = Effects of the Date Line |author =  |date =  |website = www.datelinetheory.com |accessdate = April 4, 2018 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170923142524/http://www.datelinetheory.com/p/effects-of-date-line.html |archivedate = September 23, 2017 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Radio equipment ===

The Electra had radio equipment for both communication and navigation, but details about that equipment are not clear. The Electra failed to establish two-way radio communications with ''Itasca'' and failed to radiolocate ''Itasca''. Many explanations have been proposed for those failures.

The plane had a modified [[Western Electric]] model 13C transmitter. The 50-watt transmitter was crystal controlled and capable of transmitting on 500&amp;nbsp;kHz, 3105&amp;nbsp;kHz, and 6210&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref name="radio"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://tighar.org/Projects/Earhart/Archives/Research/ResearchPapers/Worldflight/prepdepart.html |title = Preparations and Departure, World Flight 1 |author =  |date =  |website = tighar.org |accessdate = April 4, 2018 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171201035410/https://tighar.org/Projects/Earhart/Archives/Research/ResearchPapers/Worldflight/prepdepart.html |archivedate = December 1, 2017 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Crystal control means that the transmitter cannot be tuned to other frequencies; the plane could transmit only on those three frequencies. The transmitter had been modified at the factory to provide the 500&amp;nbsp;kHz capability.

The plane had a modified Western Electric model 20B receiver. Ordinarily, the receiver covered four frequency bands: 188–420&amp;nbsp;kHz, 550–1500&amp;nbsp;kHz, 1500–4000&amp;nbsp;kHz, and 4000–10000&amp;nbsp;kHz. The receiver was modified to lower the frequencies in the second band to 485–1200&amp;nbsp;kHz. That modification allowed the reception of 500&amp;nbsp;kHz signals; such signals were used for marine distress calls and radionavigation.&lt;ref name="radio" /&gt;{{refn|The 485&amp;nbsp;1200&amp;nbsp;kHz may be a guess based on the subsequent model 20BA having that range.|group=Note}} The model 20B receiver has two antenna inputs: a low frequency antenna input and a high frequency antenna input. The receiver's band selector also selects which antenna input is used; the first two bands use the low frequency antenna, and the last two bands select the high frequency antenna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://tighar.org/Projects/Earhart/Archives/Research/ResearchPapers/ElectraRadios/ElectraRadios.htm |title = Archived copy |accessdate = December 4, 2017 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171102220035/http://tighar.org/Projects/Earhart/Archives/Research/ResearchPapers/ElectraRadios/ElectraRadios.htm |archivedate = November 2, 2017 |df = mdy-all }} "The antenna input circuit of the Model 20 receivers was designed to accept connections from two separate antennas: one for low-frequency Bands 1 and 2, the other for high-frequency bands 3 and 4."&lt;/ref&gt;

It is unknown whether the model 20B receiver had a [[beat frequency oscillator]] that would enable the detection of continuous wave transmissions such as Morse code and radiolocation beacons.&lt;ref name="radio" /&gt; Neither Earhart nor Noonan were capable of using Morse code.{{sfn|Chater|1937}} They relied on voice communications. Manning, who was on the first world flight attempt but not the second, was skilled at Morse and had acquired an FCC aircraft radiotelegraph license for 15 words per minute in March 1937, just prior to the start of the first flight.{{sfn|Long|Long|1999|p=62}}&lt;!-- Consequently, the first flight would have had CW-capable equipment and an operator with the knowledge to use it. Even if the BFO were there, Earhart and Noonan may not have known how to use it. Earhart could find Hawaii broadcast bands (&lt;1600 kHz), but she expected voice modulation when using the RDF. She thought she had to be talking/whistling to enable a fix on her, but she only had to transmit a carrier. That suggests either the receiver didn't have a BFO or that Earhart did not understand how to use it. --&gt;

A separate automatic radio direction finder receiver, a prototype Hooven Radio Compass,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |inventor-last = Hooven |inventor-first = Frederick J. |title = Radio Compass System |country-code = US |patent-number = 2220904 |publication-date = July 16, 1936 |issue-date = November 12, 1940 }}&lt;/ref&gt; had been installed in the plane in October 1936, but that receiver was removed before the flight to save weight.&lt;ref&gt;"A bit of history", {{cite web |url = https://tighar.org/Projects/Earhart/Archives/Forum/Highlights61_80/highlights69.html |title = Archived copy |accessdate = November 23, 2017 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171201033431/https://tighar.org/Projects/Earhart/Archives/Forum/Highlights61_80/highlights69.html |archivedate = December 1, 2017 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Letter, Hooven to Goerner, December 5, 1966, {{cite web |url = https://earharttruth.wordpress.com/2017/05/15/hoovens-1966-letter-to-fred-goerner-quite-clear-removal-of-his-radio-compass-doomed-earhart/ |title = Archived copy |accessdate = November 25, 2017 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171201032942/https://earharttruth.wordpress.com/2017/05/15/hoovens-1966-letter-to-fred-goerner-quite-clear-removal-of-his-radio-compass-doomed-earhart/ |archivedate = December 1, 2017 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hooven Radio Compass was replaced with a Bendix coupling unit that allowed a conventional loop antenna to be attached to an existing receiver (i.e., the Western Electric 20B). The loop antenna is visible above the cockpit on Earhart's plane.&lt;!-- early pictures show the Hooven antenna dome; later pictures show the loop --&gt;

Alternatively, the loop antenna may have been connected to a Bendix RA-1 auxiliary receiver with direction finding capability up to 1500&amp;nbsp;kHz.{{refn|The loop antenna and not the receiver ordinarily limit RDF.

=== Nearing Howland Island ===

[[File:USCGS Itasca.jpg|thumb|USCGC ''Itasca'' was at Howland Island to support the flight.]]

The [[USCGC Itasca (1929)|USCGC ''Itasca'']] was on station at Howland. Its task was to communicate with Earhart's Electra and guide them to the island once they arrived in the vicinity. Noonan and Earhart expected to do voice communications on 3105&amp;nbsp;kHz during the night and 6210&amp;nbsp;kHz during the day.

Through a series of misunderstandings or errors (the details of which are still controversial), the final approach to Howland Island using [[radio navigation]] was not successful. Fred Noonan had earlier written about problems affecting the accuracy of radio direction finding in navigation.{{refn|Noonan, Fred. Memo to Operations Manager, Pacific Division, Pan American Airlines, April 29, 1935: "The inaccuracies of direction finding bearings can be very definitely cataloged: twilight effects, faint signals, wide splits of minima and inaccurate calibration."|group=Note}} Another cited cause of possible confusion was that the ''Itasca'' and Earhart planned their communication schedule using time systems set a half-hour apart, with Earhart using Greenwich Civil Time (GCT) and the ''Itasca'' under a Naval time zone designation system.&lt;ref name="Hoversten"&gt;Hoversten 2007, pp. 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Electra expected ''Itasca'' to transmit signals that the Electra could use as an RDF beacon to find the ''Itasca''.  In theory, the plane could listen for the signal while rotating its [[loop antenna]]. A sharp minimum indicates the direction of the RDF beacon. The Electra's RDF equipment had failed due to a blown fuse during an earlier leg flying to Darwin; the fuse was replaced.&lt;ref&gt;Abbott, 1937, {{cite web |url = https://tighar.org/Projects/Earhart/Archives/Documents/Letters/Abbott8_3_37.pdf |title = Archived copy |accessdate = November 19, 2017 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161019053024/http://tighar.org/Projects/Earhart/Archives/Documents/Letters/Abbott8_3_37.pdf |archivedate = October 19, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Near Howland, Earhart could hear the transmission from ''Itasca'' on 7500&amp;nbsp;kHz, but she was unable to determine a minimum, so she could not determine a direction to ''Itasca''. Earhart was also unable to determine a minimum during an RDF test at Lae.{{sfn|Chater|1937}} One likely theory is that Earhart's RDF equipment did not work at 7500&amp;nbsp;kHz; most RDF equipment at the time was not designed to work above 2000&amp;nbsp;kHz. When operated above their design frequency, loop antennas lose their directionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Long|Long|1999|p=116}} stating, "However, the frequencies of the Bendix receiver's bands 4 and 5 were completely out of the design range of the direction-finder, and the loop could not process the signals to obtain bearings."&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|{{harvtxt|Chater|1937}} shows that ''Itasca'' transmitters were calibrated for 7500, 6210, 3105, 500, and 425&amp;nbsp;kHz. Chater also reports that Earhart tested the Lockheed's 600&amp;nbsp;m (500&amp;nbsp;kHz) longwave receiver. Earhart's instructions to ''Itasca'' said "NOW UNDERSTAND ITASCA VOICING THREE ONE NAUGHT FIVE ON HOUR AND HALF HOUR WITH LONG CONTINUOUS SIGNAL ON APPROACH".|group=Note}}&lt;!-- Another explanation is that Itasca could only transmit CW on 7500&amp;nbsp;kHz. If Earhart's receiver did not have a beat frequency oscillator (BFO) or the BFO was not enabled, then it would be difficult to recognize Itasca's transmissions. --&gt;

''Itasca'' had its own RDF equipment, but that equipment did not work above 550&amp;nbsp;kHz,{{sfn|Chater|1937}} so ''Itasca'' could not determine the direction to the Electra's HF transmissions at 3105 and 6210&amp;nbsp;kHz. The Electra had been equipped to transmit a 500&amp;nbsp;kHz signal that ''Itasca'' could use for radio direction finding, but some of that equipment had been removed. The equipment originally used a long trailing wire antenna. While the plane was in flight, the wire antenna would be paid out at the tail; efficient transmissions at 500&amp;nbsp;kHz needed a long antenna. The antenna was bulky and heavy, so the trailing wire antenna was removed to save weight. If nothing else had been done, the plane would have been unable to transmit an RDF signal that ''Itasca'' could use. Such a modification was made, but without voice communication from ''Itasca'' to the plane, the ship could not tell the plane to use its 500&amp;nbsp;kHz signal.{{refn|The ''Itasca'' did request RDF transmission on 500&amp;nbsp;kHz.

Some sources have noted Earhart's apparent lack of understanding of her direction-finding system, which had been fitted to the aircraft just prior to the flight. The system was equipped with a new receiver from [[Bendix Corporation|Bendix]] that operated on five wavelength "bands", marked 1 to 5. The loop antenna was equipped with a tuneable [[loading coil]] that changed the effective length of the antenna to allow it to work efficiently at different wavelengths. The tuner on the antenna was also marked with five settings, 1 to 5, but, critically, these were not the same frequency bands as the corresponding bands on the radio. The two were close enough for settings 1, 2 and 3, but the higher frequency settings, 4 and 5, were entirely different. The upper bands (4 and 5) could not be used for direction finding.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Long|Long|1999|p=116}} states, "Earhart though she could take a radio bearing with her direction-finder loop on any signal between 200 and 10,000 kilocycles. She could not."&lt;/ref&gt; Earhart's only training on the system was a brief introduction by Joe Gurr at the Lockheed factory, and the topic had not come up. A card displaying the band settings of the antenna was mounted so it was not visible. Gurr explained that higher frequency bands would offer better accuracy and longer range.{{sfn|Long|Long|1999|p=116}}

Motion picture evidence from Lae suggests that an [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] mounted underneath the fuselage may have been torn off from the fuel-heavy Electra during taxi or takeoff from Lae's turf runway, though no antenna was reported found at Lae. Don Dwiggins, in his biography of Paul Mantz (who assisted Earhart and Noonan in their flight planning), noted that the aviators had cut off their long-wire antenna, due to the annoyance of having to crank it back into the aircraft after each use.

During Earhart and Noonan's approach to Howland Island, the ''Itasca'' received strong and clear voice transmissions from Earhart identifying as KHAQQ but she apparently was unable to hear voice transmissions from the ship. Signals from the ship would also be used for direction finding, implying that the aircraft's direction finder was also not functional.

The first calls, routine reports stating the weather as cloudy and overcast, were received at &lt;time datetime="1937-07-02T02:45-11:30" title="14:15Z"&gt;2:45&lt;/time&gt; and just before &lt;time datetime="1937-07-02T05:00-11:30" title="16:30Z"&gt;5&amp;nbsp;am on July 2&lt;/time&gt;. These calls were broken up by static, but at this point the aircraft would still be a long distance from Howland.{{sfn|Fleming|2011|p=2}}

At &lt;time datetime="1937-07-02T06:14-11:30" title="17:44Z"&gt;6:14&amp;nbsp;am&lt;/time&gt; another call was received stating the aircraft was within {{convert|200|miles|km}}, and requested that the ship use its direction finder to provide a bearing for the aircraft. Earhart began whistling into the microphone to provide a continual signal for them to home in on.{{sfn|Fleming|2011|p=3}} It was at this point that the radio operators on the ''Itasca'' realized that their RDF system could not tune in the aircraft's 3105&amp;nbsp;kHz frequency; radioman Leo Bellarts later commented that he "was sitting there sweating blood because I couldn't do a darn thing about it." A similar call asking for a bearing was received at &lt;time datetime="1937-07-02T06:45-11:30" title="18:15Z"&gt;6:45&amp;nbsp;am&lt;/time&gt;, when Earhart estimated they were {{convert|100|miles|km}} out.{{sfn|Fleming|2011|p=4}}

This transmission was reported by the ''Itasca'' as the loudest possible signal, indicating Earhart and Noonan were in the immediate area.

The ''Itasca'' used her oil-fired boilers to generate smoke for a period of time but the fliers apparently did not see it. The many scattered clouds in the area around Howland Island have also been cited as a problem: their dark shadows on the ocean surface may have been almost indistinguishable from the island's subdued and very flat profile.

Whether any post-loss radio signals were received from Earhart and Noonan remains unclear. If transmissions were received from the Electra, most if not all were weak and hopelessly garbled. Earhart's voice transmissions to Howland were on 3105&amp;nbsp;kHz, a frequency restricted in the United States by the FCC to aviation use.{{refn|Quote: "Frequencies between 2,504 to 3,497.5 kc were allocated to "Coastal harbor, government, aviation, fixed, miscellaneous".&lt;ref&gt;''American Radio Relay League 1945'', p. 453.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} This frequency was thought to be not fit for broadcasts over great distances.

=== Search efforts ===

Beginning approximately one hour after Earhart's last recorded message, the USCGC ''Itasca'' undertook an ultimately unsuccessful search north and west of Howland Island based on initial assumptions about transmissions from the aircraft. The [[United States Navy]] soon joined the search and over a period of about three days sent available resources to the search area in the vicinity of Howland Island. The initial search by the ''Itasca'' involved running up the 157/337 line of position to the NNW from Howland Island. The ''Itasca'' then searched the area to the immediate NE of the island, corresponding to the area, yet wider than the area searched to the NW. Based on bearings of several supposed Earhart radio transmissions, some of the search efforts were directed to a specific position on a line of 281 degrees (approximately northwest) from Howland Island without evidence of the flyers.{{sfn|Goldstein|Dillon|1997|p=251}} Four days after Earhart's last verified radio transmission, on July 6, 1937, the captain of the battleship ''Colorado'' received orders from the Commandant, [[United States Naval Districts#14th Naval District|Fourteenth Naval District]] to take over all naval and coast guard units to coordinate search efforts.{{sfn|Goldstein|Dillon|1997|p=251}}

Later search efforts were directed to the [[Phoenix Islands]] south of Howland Island.{{sfn|Goldstein|Dillon|1997|p=248}} A week after the disappearance, naval aircraft from the ''Colorado'' flew over several islands in the group including Gardner Island (now called [[Nikumaroro]]), which had been uninhabited for over 40 years. The subsequent report on Gardner read: "Here signs of recent habitation were clearly visible but repeated circling and zooming failed to elicit any answering wave from possible inhabitants and it was finally taken for granted that none were there... At the western end of the island a [[tramp trade|tramp steamer]] (of about 4000 tons)... lay high and almost dry head onto the coral beach with her back broken in two places. The lagoon at Gardner looked sufficiently deep and certainly large enough so that a seaplane or even an airboat could have landed or takenoff {{sic}} in any direction with little if any difficulty. Given a chance, it is believed that Miss Earhart could have landed her aircraft in this lagoon and swum or waded ashore."{{refn|Memo from Senior Aviator, USS ''Colorado'', to the [[Bureau of Aeronautics|Chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics]], "Aircraft Search of Earhart Plane". Their commander Capt Friedell made no note of "recent habitation" in his official summary.&lt;ref&gt;''Finding Amelia'' DVD, Annapolis, Maryland: Naval Institute Press, 2006. DVD: Contents: Reports: Lambrecht.pdf, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} They also found that Gardner's shape and size as recorded on charts were wholly inaccurate. Other Navy search efforts were again directed north, west and southwest of Howland Island, based on a possibility the Electra had ditched in the ocean, was afloat, or that the aviators were in an emergency raft.{{sfn|Goldstein|Dillon|1997|p=254}}

The official search efforts lasted until July 19, 1937.{{sfn|Safford|2003|pp=61–62, 67–68}} At $4&amp;nbsp;million, the air and sea search by the Navy and [[Coast Guard]] was the most costly and intensive in U.S. history up to that time but [[search and rescue]] techniques during the era were rudimentary and some of the search was based on erroneous assumptions and flawed information. Official reporting of the search effort was influenced by individuals wary about how their roles in looking for an American hero might be reported by the press.{{sfn|Goldstein|Dillon|1997|p=254–255}}{{refn| FDR himself had to respond to accusations that the search was justified.|group=Note}} Despite an unprecedented search by the United States Navy and Coast Guard, no physical evidence of Earhart, Noonan or the Electra 10E was found. The aircraft carrier {{USS|Lexington|CV-2|6}}, the battleship {{USS|Colorado|BB-45|6}}, the {{USCGC|Itasca|1929|2}}, the Japanese oceanographic survey vessel ''Koshu'' and the Japanese seaplane tender [[Japanese seaplane tender Kamoi|''Kamoi'']] searched for six–seven days each, covering {{convert|150000|sqmi|km2}}.{{sfn|Goldstein|Dillon|1997|p=245–254}}{{sfn|King|Jacobson|Burns|Spading|2001|pp=32–33}}

Immediately after the end of the official search, Putnam financed a private search by local authorities of nearby Pacific islands and waters, concentrating on the Gilberts. In late July 1937, Putnam chartered two small boats and while he remained in the United States, directed a search of the [[Phoenix Islands]], [[Christmas Island (Kiribati)|Christmas (Kiritimati) Island]], [[Tabuaeran|Fanning (Tabuaeran) Island]], the [[Gilbert Islands]] and the [[Marshall Islands]], but [[List of aerial disappearances|no trace of the Electra or its occupants was found]].{{sfn|Goldstein|Dillon|1997|p=257}}

Back in the United States, Putnam acted to become the trustee of Earhart's estate so that he could pay for the searches and related bills. In probate court in Los Angeles, Putnam requested to have the "[[declared death in absentia|declared death ''in absentia'']]" seven-year waiting period waived so that he could manage Earhart's finances. As a result, Earhart was declared legally dead on January 5, 1939.{{sfn|Van Pelt|2005|p=205}}

== Speculation on disappearance ==

There has been considerable speculation on what happened to Earhart and Noonan. Most historians hold to the simple "crash and sink" theory, but a number of other possibilities have been proposed, including several conspiracy theories.

{{wide image|Earhart locations.png|700px|Earhart's flight was intended to be from [[Lae Airfield]] to [[Howland Island]], a trip of {{convert|2556|miles|nmi km|-2}}. This leg was the longest of the planned flight, the length was close to the maximum range of the plane, and the destination was a small island in a large ocean.}}

Some have suggested that Earhart and Noonan survived and landed elsewhere, but were either never found or killed, making en-route locations like [[Tarawa]] unlikely.  Proposals have included the uninhabited [[Gardner Island]] ({{convert|400|miles|km|-1}} from the vicinity of Howland), the Japanese-controlled [[Marshall Islands]] ({{convert|870|miles|km|-1}} at the closest point of [[Mili Atoll]]), and the Japanese-controlled [[Northern Mariana Islands]] ({{convert|2700|miles|km|-2}} from Howland).

=== Crash and sink theory ===

Many researchers believe that Earhart and Noonan ran out of fuel while searching for Howland Island, ditched at sea, and perished. The plane would have carried enough fuel to reach Howland with some extra to spare. The extra fuel would cover some contingencies such as headwinds and searching for Howland. The plane could fly a compass course toward Howland through the night. In the morning, the time of apparent sunrise would allow the plane to determine its line of position (a sun line that ran 157°–337°). From that line, the plane could determine how much further it must travel before reaching a parallel sun line that ran through Howland.&lt;ref name="sunline"&gt;{{cite journal |title = We are on the line 157 337 … |journal = TIGHAR Tracks |volume = 18 |issue = 2 |date = March 2002 |url = https://tighar.org/Publications/TTracks/2002Vol_18/line.pdf |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170821002848/http://tighar.org/Publications/TTracks/2002Vol_18/line.pdf |archivedate = August 21, 2017 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; At 6:14 AM ''Itasca'' time, Earhart estimated they were 200 miles away from Howland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://tighar.org/Publications/TTracks/1995Vol_11/said.pdf |title = TIGHAR Tracks |accessdate = November 8, 2017 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130124152213/http://tighar.org/Publications/TTracks/1995Vol_11/said.pdf |archivedate = January 24, 2013 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the plane closed with Howland, it expected to be in radio contact with ''Itasca''. With the radio contact, the plane should be able to use radio direction finding (RDF) to head directly for the ''Itasca'' and Howland. Unfortunately, the plane was not receiving a radio signal from ''Itasca'', so it would be unable to determine an RDF bearing to the ship.{{refn|Earhart apparently did not understand the limitations of the RDF equipment. Earhart asked ''Itasca'' to transmit an RDF beacon at 7500&amp;nbsp;kHz, but the plane's RDF system could not determine the direction of such a HF signal. Earhart had failed to find a minimum (the transmitter direction) during a test of the RDF at Lae {{harv|Chater|1937}}, and the plane also failed to find a minimum while listening to ''Itasca'' while near Howland.|group=Note}} Although ''Itasca'' was receiving HF radio signals from the plane, it did not have HF RDF equipment, so it could not determine a bearing to the plane.{{refn|RDF equipment on ''Itasca'' could handle 270&amp;nbsp;kHz to 550&amp;nbsp;kHz {{harv|Chater|1937}}; Earhart had removed the 500&amp;nbsp;kHz trailing wire antenna from the plane and did not transmit on 500&amp;nbsp;kHz. The plane transmitted on 3105 and 6210&amp;nbsp;kHz.|group=Note}} The communications going to the plane were almost non-existent.{{refn|The plane apparently only heard transmissions on 7500&amp;nbsp;kHz, but ''Itasca'' could only transmit Morse code (not voice) on that frequency. Neither Earhart nor Noonan were skilled at Morse. {{harvtxt|Chater|1937}} at Lae states, "Miss Earhart and Captain Noonan spent a considerable time in the radio office and as previously mentioned it was learned that neither of them could read morse at any speed but could only distinguish letters made individually slowly and repeated often; in that case their direction finding apparatus would be useless or misleading unless they were taking a bearing on a station using radiophone which could give the station position on voice. We understand the ''Itasca'' was to do this but if the plane was unable to pick up the ''Itasca'' it is doubtful if the direction finder would be any use to her."|group=Note}} Consequently, the plane was not directed to Howland; it was left on its own with little fuel. Presumably, the plane reached the parallel sun line and started searching for Howland on that line of position. At 7:42 AM, Earhart reported, "We must be on you, but cannot see you – but gas is running low. Have been unable to reach you by radio. We are flying at 1,000 feet."&lt;ref name="sunline" /&gt;{{refn|At an altitude of 1000 feet, the plane would be able to see about 38 miles in clear weather. See Distance to Horizon Calculator at http://www.ringbell.co.uk/info/hdist.htm.|group=Note}} At 8:43 AM, Earhart reported, "We are on the line 157 337. We will repeat this message.

David Jourdan, a former Navy submariner and ocean engineer specializing in deep-sea recoveries, has claimed any transmissions attributed to Gardner Island were false. Through his company Nauticos he extensively searched a {{convert|1200|sqmi|km2|adj=on}} quadrant north and west of Howland Island during two deep-sea sonar expeditions (2002 and 2006, total cost $4.5&amp;nbsp;million) and found nothing.

=== Gardner Island hypothesis ===
[[File:Nikumaroro Atoll 2014.jpg|thumb|Gardner ([[Nikumaroro]]) Island in 2014.  "Seven Site" is a focus of the search for Amelia Earhart's remains.|350px ]]
The Gardner Island hypothesis assumes that Earhart and Noonan, having not found Howland Island, would not waste time searching for Howland. Instead, they would turn to the south and look for other islands. The 157/337 radio transmission suggests they flew a course of 157° that would take them past Baker Island; if they missed Baker Island, then sometime later they would fly over the [[Phoenix Islands]], now part of the [[Kiribati|Republic of Kiribati]], about {{convert|350|nmi|km}} south-southeast of Howland Island. The Gardner Island hypothesis has the plane making it to Gardner Island (now [[Nikumaroro]]), one of the Phoenix Islands.

A week after Earhart disappeared, Navy planes from {{USS|Colorado|BB-45|6}} (which had sailed from Pearl Harbor) searched Gardner Island. The planes saw signs of recent habitation and the wreck of the {{SS|Norwich City}}, but did not see any signs of Earhart's plane or people.  After the Navy ended its search, G. P. Putnam undertook a search in the Phoenix Group and other islands,&lt;ref&gt;[[#refRich1989|Rich 1989]], pp. 272–273.&lt;/ref&gt; but nothing was found.

In October 1937, Eric Bevington and Henry E. Maude visited Gardner with some potential settlers. A group walked all the way around the island, but did not find a plane or other evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://tighar.org/Projects/Earhart/Archives/Documents/Bevington_Diary.html |title = The Earhart Project Research Document #11 Eric Bevington’s Journal |work = [[TIGHAR]] |accessdate = July 9, 2017 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170719205728/http://tighar.org/Projects/Earhart/Archives/Documents/Bevington_Diary.html |archivedate = July 19, 2017 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1938, laborers landed on the island and started constructing the settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://tighar.org/Projects/Earhart/Archives/Documents/Gallagher_Report.html |title = The Earhart Project Research Document #13 Gallagher’s Ninth Progress Report October – December, 1940 |work = [[TIGHAR]] |accessdate = July 9, 2017 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170721002209/http://tighar.org/Projects/Earhart/Archives/Documents/Gallagher_Report.html |archivedate = July 21, 2017 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1939, {{USS|Bushnell|AS-2|6}} did a survey of the island.&lt;ref name="ghost"/&gt;

Around April 1940, a skull was discovered and buried, but British colonial officer [[Gerald Gallagher]], did not learn of it until September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://tighar.org/Projects/Earhart/Archives/Documents/Bones_Chronology.html |title = The Earhart Project Research Document #12 The Bones Chronology |work = [[TIGHAR]] |accessdate = July 9, 2017 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170716082016/https://tighar.org/Projects/Earhart/Archives/Documents/Bones_Chronology.html |archivedate = July 16, 2017 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gallagher did a more thorough search of discovery area, including looking for artifacts such as rings. The search found more bones, a bottle, a shoe, and a sextant box. On September 23, 1940, Gallagher radioed his superiors that he had found a "skeleton ... possibly that of a woman", along with an old-fashioned [[sextant]] box, under a tree on the island's southeast corner. Gallagher stated the "Bones look more than four years old to me but there seems to be very slight chance that this may be remains of Amelia Earhardt." He was ordered to send the remains to [[Fiji]]. On 4 April 1941, Dr. D. W. Hoodless of the [[Fiji School of Medicine|Central Medical School]] examined the bones, took measurements, and wrote a report. Using [[Karl Pearson]]'s formulas for stature and the lengths of the [[femur]], [[tibia]], and [[humerus]], Hoodless concluded that the person was about {{convert|5|ft|5.5|in|cm}} tall.  Hoodless also wrote "it may be definitely stated that the skeleton is that of a MALE." [Emphasis in original.] Hoodless further stated, "Owing to the weather-beaten condition of all the bones it is impossible to be dogmatic in regard to the age of the person at the time of death, but I am of the opinion that he was not less than 45 years of age and that probably he was older: say between 45 and 55 years." Hoodless offered to make more detailed measurements if needed, but suggested any further examination be done by the Anthropological Department at [[University of Sydney|Sydney University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://tighar.org/Projects/Earhart/Archives/Documents/Bones_Chronology3.html |title = The Earhart Project Research Document #12 The Bones Chronology, Cont. |work = [[TIGHAR]] |accessdate = July 9, 2017 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170814094546/http://tighar.org/Projects/Earhart/Archives/Documents/Bones_Chronology3.html |archivedate = August 14, 2017 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |first=D.

=== Japanese capture theory ===

Another theory is that Earhart and Noonan were captured by Japanese forces, perhaps after somehow navigating to somewhere within the Japanese [[South Pacific Mandate]].

In 1966, [[CBS]] [[Correspondent]] Fred Goerner published a book claiming that Earhart and Noonan were captured and executed when their aircraft crashed on the island of [[Saipan]], part of the [[Northern Mariana Islands]] archipelago.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F06E1D9133BF935A2575AC0A962958260 "Obituary: Fred Goerner, Broadcaster, 69."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206170118/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F06E1D9133BF935A2575AC0A962958260 |date=December 6, 2008 }} ''The New York Times'', September 16, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,836416-2,00.html "Sinister Conspiracy?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001002131/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,836416-2,00.html |date=October 1, 2007 }} ''Time'', September 16, 1966.

Later proponents of the Japanese capture hypothesis have generally suggested the [[Marshall Islands]] instead, which while still distant from the intended location (~800 miles), is slightly more possible.&lt;ref name="irvingdb" /&gt;

In 1990, the [[NBC-TV]] series ''[[Unsolved Mysteries]]'' broadcast an interview with a Saipanese woman who claimed to have witnessed Earhart and Noonan's execution by Japanese soldiers. No independent confirmation has ever emerged for any of these claims.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refStrippel1995|Strippel 1995]], p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; Various purported photographs of Earhart during her captivity have been identified as either fraudulent or having been taken before her final flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://tighar.org/Projects/Earhart/Archives/Forum/FAQs/captured.htm |title = Isn't it possible that Earhart could have been captured by the Japanese? |work = [[TIGHAR]] |accessdate = July 5, 2017 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170709060205/http://tighar.org/Projects/Earhart/Archives/Forum/FAQs/captured.htm |archivedate = July 9, 2017 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A slightly different version of the Japanese capture hypothesis is not that the Japanese captured Earhart, but rather that they shot down her plane.  Henri Keyzer-Andre, a former [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]] pilot, propounded this view in his 1993 book ''Age Of Heroes: Incredible Adventures of a Pan Am Pilot and his Greatest Triumph, Unravelling the Mystery of Amelia Earhart''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-8038-9351-1 |title = Nonfiction Book Review: Age of Heroes Incredible Adve by Henri Keyzer-Andre, Author, Hy Steirman, Author Hastings House Book Publishers $22.5 (302p) |isbn = 978-0-8038-9351-1 |publisher = Publishers Weekly |access-date = March 28, 2016 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160924170941/http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-8038-9351-1 |archivedate = September 24, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the end of [[World War II]], a location on [[Tinian]], which is five miles (8&amp;nbsp;km) southwest of Saipan, had been rumored to be the grave of the two aviators. In 2004, an archaeological dig at the site failed to turn up any bones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.tighar.org/Projects/Earhart/Tinian/tigharstinian.htm |title = TIGHARs on Tinian |work = [[TIGHAR]] |date = November 15, 2004 |accessdate = July 5, 2017 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101225133456/http://tighar.org/Projects/Earhart/Tinian/tigharstinian.htm |archivedate = December 25, 2010 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of Earhart's relatives have been convinced that the Japanese were somehow involved in Amelia's disappearance, citing unnamed witnesses including Japanese troops and Saipan natives.{{sfn|Goldstein|Dillon|1997|pp=244, 266}}&lt;ref name="NevadaAppeal"&gt;Henley, David C.

In 2017, a [[History Channel]] documentary, ''[[Amelia Earhart: The Lost Evidence]]'', proposed that a photograph in the National Archives of [[Jaluit Atoll]] in the [[Marshall Islands]] was actually a picture of a captured Earhart and Noonan.  The picture showed a Caucasian male on a dock who appeared to look like Noonan and a woman sitting on the dock but facing away from the camera, who was judged to have a physique and haircut resembling Earhart's.  The documentary theorizes that the photo was taken after Earhart and Noonan crashed at [[Mili Atoll]].  The documentary also said that physical evidence recovered from Mili matches pieces that could have fallen off an Electra during a crash or subsequent overland move to a barge.  ''The Lost Evidence''  proposed that a Japanese ship seen in the photograph was the ''Koshu Maru'', a Japanese military ship.  ''The Lost Evidence'' was quickly discredited, however, after Japanese blogger Kota Yamano found the original source of the photograph in the Archives in the [[National Diet Library]] Digital Collection.  The original source of the photo was a Japanese travel guide published in October 1935, implying that the photograph was taken in 1935 or before, and thus would be unrelated to Earhart and Noonan's 1937 disappearance.  Additionally, the researcher who discovered the photo also identified the ship in the right of the photo as another ship called ''Koshu'' seized by [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] Japanese forces in World War I and not the ''Koshu Maru''.&lt;ref name="nprdebunk"&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Domonoske |first1 = Camila |title = Japanese Blogger Points Out Timeline Flaw In Supposed Earhart Photo |url = https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/07/11/536620463/japanese-blogger-points-out-timeline-flaw-in-supposed-earhart-photo |accessdate = July 11, 2017 |work = NPR |language = en |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170711162559/http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/07/11/536620463/japanese-blogger-points-out-timeline-flaw-in-supposed-earhart-photo |archivedate = July 11, 2017 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common criticism of all versions of the Japanese capture hypothesis is that the Japanese-controlled Marshall Islands were considerably distant from Howland Island.  To reach and land there would have required Earhart and Noonan, though low on fuel, to change her northeast course as she neared Howland Island and fly hundreds of miles northwest, a feat "not supported by the basic rules of geography and navigation."&lt;ref name="smithsonian"&gt;{{cite magazine |last = Katz |first = Brigit |date = July 5, 2017 |title = Smithsonian Curator Weighs In on Photo That Allegedly Shows Amelia Earhart in Japanese Captivity |url = http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/smithsonian-curator-photo-allegedly-shows-amelia-earhart-japanese-captivity-180963964/ |magazine = Smithsonian |access-date = September 3, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="irvingdb" /&gt;  Additionally, had the Japanese found a crashed Earhart and Noonan, they would have had substantial motivation to rescue the famous aviators and be hailed as heroes.&lt;ref name="irvingdb" /&gt;

=== Myths, legends, and claims ===

The unresolved circumstances of Earhart's disappearance, along with her fame, attracted a great body of other claims relating to her last flight. Several unsupported theories have become known in popular culture.

==== Spies for FDR ====

The World War II-era movie ''[[Flight for Freedom]]'' (1943) is a story of a fictional female aviator (obviously inspired by Earhart) who engages in a spying mission in the Pacific.  The movie helped further a myth that Earhart was spying on the Japanese in the Pacific at the request of the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] administration.{{refn| Some authors have speculated that Earhart and Noonan were shot down by Japanese aircraft because she was thought to be spying on Japanese territory so America could supposedly plan an attack.|group=Note}} By 1949, both the [[United Press]] and U.S. Army Intelligence had concluded that this rumor was groundless. [[Jacqueline Cochran|Jackie Cochran]], another pioneering aviator and one of Earhart's friends, made a postwar search of numerous files in Japan and was convinced that the Japanese were not involved in Earhart's disappearance.{{sfn|Cochran|1954|p=160}}

==== Tokyo Rose ====

A rumor that claimed that Earhart had made propaganda radio broadcasts as one of the many women compelled to serve as [[Tokyo Rose]] was investigated closely by George Putnam. According to several biographies of Earhart, Putnam investigated this rumor personally but after listening to many recordings of numerous Tokyo Roses, he did not recognize her voice among them.{{sfn|Goldstein|Dillon|1997|p=282}}

==== New Britain ====

The theory that Earhart may have turned back mid-flight has been posited. She would then have tried to reach the airfield at [[Rabaul]], [[New Britain]] (northeast of mainland [[Papua New Guinea]]), approximately {{convert|2200|mi|km}} from Howland.&lt;ref&gt;"The Enduring Mystery of Amelia Earhart's Disappearance Maybe Finally Coming To an End". ''The Atlantic Flyer'', September 2007, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, Donald Angwin, a veteran of the [[Australian Army]]'s World War II [[New Britain campaign|campaign in New Britain]], contacted researchers to suggest that a wrecked aircraft he had witnessed in jungle about {{convert|40|mi|km}} southwest of Rabaul, on April 17, 1945, may have been Earhart's Electra.&lt;ref name="Billings"&gt;Billings, David.

Retrieved: March 27, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; reported that he and other members of a forward patrol on Japanese-occupied New Britain had found a wrecked twin-engined, unpainted all-metal aircraft. The soldiers recorded a rough position on a map, along with serial numbers seen on the wreckage. While the map was located in the possession of another veteran in 1993, subsequent searches of the area indicated failed to find a wreck.&lt;ref name="Billings" /&gt;

While Angwin died in 2001, David Billings, an Australian aircraft engineer, has continued to investigate his theory. Billings claims that the serial numbers written on the map, &lt;small&gt;"600H/P S3HI C/N1055"&lt;/small&gt;, represent:
* a {{convert|600|hp|kW|abbr=on}} [[Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1340]]-S3H1 model engine; and
* "Constructor's Number 1055", an airframe identifier.
These would be consistent with a Lockheed Electra 10E, such as that flown by Earhart, although they do not contain enough information to identify the wreck in question as NR16020.&lt;ref name="Billings" /&gt;

Pacific Wrecks, a website that documents World War II-era aircraft crash sites, notes that no Electra has been reported lost in or around Papua New Guinea. Gillespie wrote that the {{convert|2000|mi|km|adj=on}} distance from Earhart's last known position to New Britain was impossible for the aircraft to fly, requiring more than 13 hours of flight when there were only four hours of fuel remaining.&lt;ref name="Pacific Wrecks"&gt;[http://pacificwrecks.com/aircraft/electra/earhart/ "Amelia Earhart Myths from the Pacific War."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403190537/http://pacificwrecks.com/aircraft/electra/earhart/ |date=April 3, 2012 }} ''Pacific Wrecks'', 2011.

==== Assuming another identity ====

In November 2006, the [[National Geographic Channel]] aired episode two of the ''Undiscovered History'' series about a claim that Earhart survived the world flight, moved to [[New Jersey]], changed her name, remarried and became [[Irene Craigmile Bolam]]. This claim had originally been raised in the book ''Amelia Earhart Lives'' (1970) by author Joe Klaas, based on the research of Major Joseph Gervais.&lt;ref&gt;Gillespie, Ric. [http://tighar.org/Projects/Earhart/Books/BookReviews/earhartsurvive.html "Is This Amelia Earhart?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100907000705/http://tighar.org/Projects/Earhart/Books/BookReviews/earhartsurvive.html |date=September 7, 2010 }} ''tighar.org'', 2009.

The book's publisher, [[McGraw-Hill]], withdrew the book from the market shortly after it was released and court records indicate that the company reached an out-of-court settlement with her.&lt;ref&gt;Gillespie, Ric.

Earhart was a widely known international celebrity during her lifetime. Her shyly charismatic appeal, independence, persistence, coolness under pressure, courage and goal-oriented career along with the circumstances of her disappearance at a comparatively early age have driven her lasting [[celebrity|fame]] in [[popular culture]]. Hundreds of articles and scores of books have been written about her life, which is often cited as a motivational tale, especially for girls. Earhart is generally regarded as a [[Feminism|feminist]] icon.{{sfn|Hamill|1976|p=49}}

Earhart's accomplishments in aviation inspired a generation of female aviators, including the more than 1,000 women pilots of the [[Women Airforce Service Pilots]] (WASP) who ferried military aircraft, towed gliders, flew target practice aircraft, and served as transport pilots during World War II.{{sfn|Regis|2008|pp=102–105}}{{sfn|Haynsworth|Toomey|1998}}

The home where Earhart was born is now the [[Amelia Earhart Birthplace Museum]] and is maintained by The Ninety-Nines, an international group of female pilots of whom Earhart was the first elected president.&lt;ref name="Amelia Earhart Birthplace Museum—Atchison, KS"&gt;[http://theyellowbrickroadtrip.blogspot.com/2009/04/amelia-earhart-birthplace-museum.html "The Yellow Brick Road Trip."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007022626/http://theyellowbrickroadtrip.blogspot.com/2009/04/amelia-earhart-birthplace-museum.html |date=October 7, 2011 }} ''theyellowbrickroadtrip.blogspot.com''.

=== Memorial flights ===

Two notable memorial flights by female aviators subsequently followed Earhart's original [[circumnavigation]]al route.
* In 1967, [[Ann Pellegreno|Ann Dearing Holtgren Pellegreno]] and a crew of three flew a similar aircraft (a Lockheed 10A Electra) to complete a world flight that closely mirrored Earhart's flight plan. On the 30th anniversary of her disappearance, Pellegreno dropped a wreath in Earhart's honor over tiny Howland Island and returned to Oakland, completing the {{convert|28000|mi|km|adj=on}} commemorative flight on July 7, 1967.&lt;ref&gt;Van Pelt, Lori.

* In 1997, on the 60th anniversary of Earhart's world flight, San Antonio businesswoman [[Linda Finch]] retraced the final flight path flying the same make and model of aircraft as Earhart, a restored 1935 Lockheed Electra 10E. Finch touched down in 18 countries before finishing the trip two and a half months later when she arrived back at Oakland Airport on May 28, 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/transportation/may97/earhart_5-28a.html "Wings of Dreams - May 28, 1997" (transcript).]  ''PBS''.

== Books by Earhart ==

Earhart was a successful and heavily promoted writer who served as aviation editor for ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' magazine from 1928 to 1930. She wrote magazine articles, newspaper columns, essays and published two books based upon her experiences as a flyer during her lifetime:
* ''[[20 Hrs., 40 Min.]]'' (1928) was a journal of her experiences as the first woman passenger on a transatlantic flight.
* ''[[The Fun of It]]'' (1932) was a memoir of her flying experiences and an essay on women in aviation.
* ''[[Last Flight (book)|Last Flight]]'' (1937) featured the periodic journal entries she sent back to the United States during her world flight attempt, published in newspapers in the weeks prior to her final departure from [[New Guinea]]. Compiled by her husband GP Putnam after she disappeared over the Pacific, many historians consider this book to be only partially Earhart's original work.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11472">An '''artificial brain''' (or '''artificial mind''') is [[Computer software|software]] and [[Computer hardware|hardware]] with cognitive abilities similar to those of the animal or [[human brain]].&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8164060.stm Artificial brain '10 years away' 2009 BBC news]&lt;/ref&gt;

Research investigating "artificial brains" and [[brain emulation]] plays three important roles in science:
#An ongoing attempt by [[neurology|neuroscientists]] to understand how the human brain works, known as [[cognitive neuroscience]].
#A thought experiment in the [[philosophy of artificial intelligence]], demonstrating that it is possible, at least in theory, to create a machine that has all the capabilities of a human being.
#A long term project to create machines exhibiting behavior comparable to those of animals with complex [[central nervous system]] such as [[mammal]]s and most particularly [[human]]s.  The ultimate goal of creating a machine exhibiting human-like behavior or intelligence is sometimes called [[Artificial general intelligence|strong AI]].

An example of the first objective is the project reported by Aston University in Birmingham, England&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.aston.ac.uk/about/news/releases/2009/march/scientists-create-living-model-of-basic-units-of-human-brain/ Aston University's news report about the project]&lt;/ref&gt; where researchers are using biological cells to create "neurospheres" (small clusters of neurons) in order to develop new treatments for diseases including [[Alzheimer's]], [[motor neurone]] and [[Parkinson's disease]].

The second objective is a reply to arguments such as [[John Searle]]'s [[Chinese room]] argument, [[Hubert Dreyfus]]' [[Dreyfus' critique of AI|critique of AI]] or [[Roger Penrose]]'s argument in ''[[The Emperor's New Mind]]''. These critics argued that there are aspects of human consciousness or expertise that can not be simulated by machines. One reply to their arguments is that the biological processes inside the brain can be simulated to any degree of accuracy. This reply was made as early as 1950, by [[Alan Turing]] in his classic paper "[[Computing Machinery and Intelligence]]".&lt;ref&gt;The critics:

&lt;/ref&gt;

The third objective is generally called [[artificial general intelligence]] by researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last=Voss | first=Peter | editor-last= Goertzel|editor-first= Ben| editor2-last= Pennachin|editor2-first= Cassio| title=Artificial General Intelligence|publisher = Springer| date= 2006|isbn=3-540-23733-X| url=http://www.adaptiveai.com/research/index.htm#different_approach|chapter=Essentials of general intelligence|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723140831/http://www.adaptiveai.com/research/index.htm|archivedate=July 23, 2013|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Ray Kurzweil]] prefers the term "strong AI".  In his book ''[[The Singularity is Near]]'', he focuses on [[whole brain emulation]] using conventional computing machines as an approach to implementing artificial brains, and claims (on grounds of computer power continuing an exponential growth trend) that this could be done by 2025.  [[Henry Markram]], director of the [[Blue Brain]] project (which is attempting brain emulation), made a similar claim (2020) at the Oxford [[TED (conference)|TED conference]] in 2009.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

== Approaches to brain simulation ==
[[File:Estimations of Human Brain Emulation Required Performance.svg|thumb|right|400px|Estimates of how much processing power is needed to emulate a human brain at various levels (from [[Ray Kurzweil]], and [[Anders Sandberg]] and [[Nick Bostrom]]), along with the fastest supercomputer from [[TOP500]] mapped by year.]] Although direct human [[brain emulation]] using [[artificial neural networks]] on a [[high-performance computing]] engine is a commonly discussed approach,&lt;ref&gt;see [[Artificial Intelligence System]], [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=591856 CAM brain machine] and [[cat intelligence#Computer simulation of the cat brain|cat brain]] for examples&lt;/ref&gt; there are other approaches. An alternative artificial brain implementation could be based on [http://www.andcorporation.com/ Holographic Neural Technology (HNeT)] non linear phase coherence/decoherence principles. The analogy has been made to quantum processes through the core synaptic algorithm which has strong similarities to the [[Schrödinger equation|quantum mechanical wave equation.]]

EvBrain&lt;ref&gt;Jung, Sung Young, [http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=6&amp;tid=18358 "A Topographical Development Method of Neural Networks for Artificial Brain Evolution"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629143518/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=6&amp;tid=18358 |date=June 29, 2011 }}, ''Artificial Life'', The MIT Press, vol. 11, issue 3 - summer, 2005, pp. 293-316&lt;/ref&gt; is a form of [[evolutionary computation|evolutionary software]] that can evolve "brainlike" neural networks, such as the network immediately behind the [[retina]].

In November 2008, IBM received a US$4.9 million grant from the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] for research into creating intelligent computers. The [[Blue Brain Project|Blue Brain project]] is being conducted with the assistance of [[IBM]] in [[Lausanne]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsvote.bbc.co.uk/mpapps/pagetools/print/news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7740484.stm?ad=1 Blue Brain in BBC News]&lt;/ref&gt; The project is based on the premise that it is possible to artificially link the [[neuron]]s "in the computer" by placing thirty million synapses in their proper three-dimensional position.

Some proponents of strong AI speculated that computers in connection with Blue Brain and Soul Catcher may exceed human intellectual capacity by around 2015, and that it is likely that we will be able to download the [[human brain]] at some time around 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} Jaap Bloem, Menno van Doorn, Sander Duivestein, Me the media: rise of the conversation society, VINT research Institute of Sogeti, 2009, p.273.&lt;/ref&gt;

While ''Blue Brain'' is able to represent complex neural connections on the large scale, the project does not achieve the link between brain activity and behaviors executed by the brain. In 2012, project [[Spaun (Semantic Pointer Architecture Unified Network)]] attempted to model multiple parts of the human brain through large-scale representations of neural connections that generate complex behaviors in addition to mapping.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/338/6111/1202.full.pdf?sid=acccce85-1ec6-4adc-9304-3a348cb9c265], A Large-Scale Model of the Functioning Brain.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spaun's design recreates elements of human brain anatomy. The model, consisting of approximately 2.5&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;neurons, includes features of the visual and motor cortices, GABAergic and dopaminergic connections, the [[ventral tegmental area]] (VTA), substantia nigra, and others. The design allows for several functions in response to eight tasks, using visual inputs of typed or handwritten characters and outputs carried out by a mechanical arm. Spaun's functions include copying a drawing, recognizing images, and counting.&lt;ref name= "test" /&gt;

There are good reasons to believe that, regardless of implementation strategy, the predictions of realising artificial brains in the near future are optimistic.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} In particular brains (including the [[human brain]]) and [[cognition]] are not currently well understood, and the scale of computation required is unknown. Another near term limitation is that all current approaches for brain simulation require orders of magnitude larger power consumption compared with a human brain. The human brain consumes about 20&amp;nbsp;[[Watt|W]] of power whereas current supercomputers may use as much as 1&amp;nbsp;MW or an order of 100,000 more.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

== Artificial brain thought experiment ==
Some critics of [[brain simulation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Goertzel|first=Ben |authorlink=Ben Goertzel |date=December 2007 |title=Human-level artificial general intelligence and the possibility of a technological singularity: a reaction to Ray Kurzweil's ''The Singularity Is Near'', and McDermott's critique of Kurzweil|journal=Artificial Intelligence |volume=171 |issue=18, Special Review Issue |pages=1161–1173 |url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=sv&amp;lr=&amp;cluster=15189798216526465792 |accessdate=April 1, 2009 |doi=10.1016/j.artint.2007.10.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; believe that it is simpler to create general intelligent action directly without imitating nature.  Some commentators&lt;ref&gt;Fox and Hayes quoted in Nilsson, Nils (1998), Artificial Intelligence: A New Synthesis, p581 Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, {{ISBN|978-1-55860-467-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; have used the analogy that early attempts to construct flying machines modeled them after birds, but that modern aircraft do not look like birds.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8987">A '''cellular evolutionary algorithm''' ('''cEA''') is a kind of [[evolutionary algorithm]] (EA) in which individuals cannot mate arbitrarily, but every one interacts with its closer neighbors on which a basic EA is applied (selection, variation, replacement).

[[File:evolution of several cEAs.png|x300px|thumb|'''Example evolution of a cEA depending on the shape of the population, from squared (left) to unidimensional ring (right). Darker colors mean better solutions. Observe how shapes different from the traditional square keep diversity (higher exploration) for a longer time. Four snapshots of cEAs at generations 0-50-100-150.''']]

The cellular model simulates natural evolution from the point of view of
the individual, which encodes a tentative (optimization, learning, search) problem solution. The essential idea of this model is to provide the EA population
with a special structure defined as a connected graph, in which each vertex is an individual who communicates with his
nearest neighbors. Particularly, individuals are conceptually set in a toroidal
mesh, and are only allowed to recombine with close individuals. This leads us
to a kind of locality known as ''isolation by distance''. The set of potential mates
of an individual is called its ''neighborhood''. It is known that, in this kind
of algorithm, similar individuals tend to cluster creating niches, and these groups
operate as if they were separate sub-populations (islands). Anyway, there is no
clear borderline between adjacent groups, and close niches could be easily
colonized by competitive niches and maybe merge solution contents during the process. Simultaneously,
farther niches can be affected more slowly.

==Introduction==

A cellular evolutionary algorithm (cEA) usually evolves a structured bidimensional
grid of individuals, although other topologies are also possible. In this grid, clusters of similar individuals are naturally created during evolution, promoting exploration in their boundaries, while exploitation is mainly performed by direct competition and merging inside them.

[[File:cEA neighborhood types.png|x200px|thumb|'''Example models of neighborhoods in cellular EAs: linear, compact, diamond and... any other!''']]

The grid is usually 2D toroidal structure, although
the number of dimensions can be easily extended (to 3D) or reduced (to 1D, e.g. a ring).
The neighborhood of a particular point of the grid (where an individual is
placed) is defined in terms of the ''Manhattan'' distance from it to others in the population. Each point of the grid has a neighborhood that overlaps the neighborhoods of nearby individuals. In the basic algorithm, all the neighborhoods have the same size and identical shapes. The two
most commonly used neighborhoods are L5, also called
''Von Neumann'' or NEWS (North, East, West and South), and C9, also known as ''Moore'' neighborhood. Here, ''L'' stands for ''Linear'' while ''C'' stands for ''Compact''.

In cEAs, the individuals can only interact with their neighbors in the reproductive
cycle where the variation operators are applied. This reproductive
cycle is executed inside the neighborhood of each individual and, generally,
consists in selecting two parents among its neighbors according to a certain
criterion, applying the variation operators to them (recombination and mutation
for example), and replacing the considered individual by the recently
created offspring following a given criterion, for instance, replace if the offspring
represents a better solution than the considered individual.

==Synchronous versus asynchronous==

In a regular '''synchronous''' cEA, the algorithm proceeds from the very first top left individual to the right and then to the several rows by using the information in the population to create a new temporary population. After finishing with the bottom-right last individual the temporary population is full with the newly computed individuals, and the replacement step starts. In it, the old population is completely and synchronously replaced with the newly computed one according to some criterion. Usually, the replacement keeps the best individual in the same position of both populations, that is, elitism is used.

We must notice that according to the update policy of the population used, we could also define an '''asynchronous''' cEA. This is also a well-known issue in [[cellular automata]]. In asynchronous cEAs the order in which the individuals in the grid are update changes depending on the criterion used: line sweep, fixed random sweep, new random sweep, and uniform choice. These are the four most usual ways of updating the population. All of them keep using the newly computed individual (or the original if better) for the computations of its neighbors immediately. This makes the population to hold at any time individual in different states of evolution, defining a very interesting new line of research.

[[File:ratio concept in cEAs.png|x300px|thumb|'''The ratio between the radii of the neighborhood to the topology defines the exploration/exploitation capability of the cEA. This could be even tuned during the run of the algorithm, giving the researcher a unique mechanism to search in very complex landscapes.''']]

The overlap of the neighborhoods provides an implicit mechanism of solution migration
to the cEA. Since the best solutions spread smoothly through the
whole population, genetic diversity in the population is preserved longer than
in non structured EAs. This soft dispersion of the best solutions through the
population is one of the main issues of the good tradeoff between ''exploration''
and ''exploitation'' that cEAs perform during the search. It is then easy to see
that we could ''tune this tradeoff'' (and hence, tune the genetic diversity level along
the evolution) by modifying (for instance) the size of the neighborhood used, as
the overlap degree between the neighborhoods grows according to the size of
the neighborhood.

A cEA can be seen as a [[cellular automaton]] (CA) with probabilistic
rewritable rules, where the alphabet of the CA is equivalent to the potential
number of solutions of the problem. Hence, if we see cEAs as a kind of CA,
it is possible to import knowledge from the field of CAs to cEAs, and in fact this is an interesting open research line.

==Parallelism==

Cellular EAs are very amenable to parallelism, thus usually found in the literature of [[parallel metaheuristics]]. In particular, fine grain parallelism can be use to assign independent threads of execution to every individual, thus allowing the whole cEA to run on a concurrent or actually parallel hardware platform. In this way, large time reductions can be obtained when running cEAs on [[FPGAs]] or [[GPUs]].

However, it is important to stress that cEAs are a model of search, in many senses different from traditional EAs. Also, they can be run in sequential and parallel platforms, reinforcing the fact that the model and the implementation are two different concepts.

See [https://www.springer.com/business/operations+research/book/978-0-387-77609-5 here] for a complete description on the fundamentals for the understanding, design, and application of cEAs.

'''Clemence of Austria''' (1262 – February 1293, or 1295) was a daughter of King [[Rudolph I of Germany]] and [[Gertrude of Hohenberg]]. She was a member of the [[House of Habsburg]].

==Marriage==
On 8 January 1281, Clemence married [[Charles Martel of Anjou]].&lt;ref&gt;Theresa Earenfight, ''Queenship in Medieval Europe'', (Palgrave Macmillan, 2013), 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

Clemence and Charles Martel had three children:
*[[Charles I of Hungary]], became King of Hungary in 1308, married four times; his first wife was Mary of Halics, his second wife was Mary Piast, his third wife was Beatrice of Luxembourg and his fourth wife was Elizabeth Piast. All of his children were with Elisabeth. His only illegitimate child was Kalman, later Bishop of Győr.
*[[Beatrice of Hungary (1290–1343)|Beatrice of Hungary]] (1290–1343), the wife of [[John II of Viennois]]
*[[Clemence of Hungary]], the second wife of [[Louis X of France]] and mother of [[John I of France]].

It is believed that Clemence died in 1293, in relation to the birth of her youngest daughter and namesake, Clemence. Others&lt;ref&gt;{{MLCC |warning=1 |url=http://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/AUSTRIA.htm#KlementiaHabsburgdied1295 |title-date= |title= Medieval Lands, AUSTRIA|date=August 2012}},&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Constantin Wurzbach, ''Biographisches Lexikon des Kaisertums Österreich'', Vienna, 1860, Vol. VI, p. 159 [http://www.literature.at/webinterface/library/ALO-BOOK_V01?objid=11804&amp;page=167&amp;zoom=3&amp;ocr= (online version)]&lt;/ref&gt; argue that she died in 1295, months after Charles Martel. She is buried in [[Naples]].

==Queen of Hungary?==
Charles Martel was set up by [[Pope Nicholas IV]] and the ecclesiastical party as the titular [[King of Hungary]] (1290–1295) as successor of his maternal uncle, the childless [[Ladislaus IV of Hungary]] against whom the Pope had already earlier declared a crusade.

He never managed to govern the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], where an agnate of the [[Árpád dynasty]], his cousin [[Andrew III of Hungary]] actually ruled that period. Charles Martel was, however, successful in asserting his claims in parts of [[Croatia]], a kingdom then in personal union with Hungary.

Charles Martel died young in Naples, during the lifetime of his parents. Charles Martel and Clemence's son, [[Charles I of Hungary|Charles]] would ultimately succeed where he had failed in winning the throne of Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Marek |first=Miroslav |url=http://genealogy.euweb.cz/habsburg/habsburg2.html |title= A listing of descendants of Rudolph I of Germany |publisher= Genealogy.EU}}{{Self-published source|date=August 2012}}{{Better source|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cyberkinetics''' is an American company with roots tied to the [[University of Utah]]. It was co-founded by John Donoghue, Mijail Serruya, Gerhard Friehs of [[Brown University]], and Nicho Hatsopoulos of the [[University of Chicago]]. The Braingate technology and related Cyberkinetic’s assets were acquired by BrainGate in 2008. [[BrainGate, Inc.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.BrainGate.com|title=Braingate}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a privately held company that holds technology that can help transform thoughts into action.&lt;ref name="Braingate gets a new lease on life"&gt;[http://www.boston.com/business/technology/innoeco/2009/08/cyberkinetics_braintocomputer.html Braingate gets a new lease on life], The Boston Globe, August, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
Scientists behind the project used $9.3 million in first round funding led by [[Oxford Bioscience Partners]]. A 2002 merger with Bionic Technologies, co-founded by Brian Hatt and [[Richard A. Normann]] (the inventor of the [[Utah array]]) added to a tech team armed with intellectual property rights gained from Brown, [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], and others. They say they're three to five years away from putting a product on the market.{{when|date=May 2015}}

According to their latest SEC filing, the Founders of the company resigned from the Board of Directors at the end of October, 2008.

==Merger and renaming==
&lt;!--check if (and if so what) parts of this section should go to the top description--&gt;
In late 2004, Cyberkinetics initiated a reverse merger with a Texas company in order to gain access to the public market. The resulting company was renamed ''[http://www.cyberkineticsinc.com/ Cyberkinetics Neurotechnology Systems, Inc.]'' and its shares are listed under the symbol CYKN.OB. In 2009, the [[BrainGate]] business and  related Cyberkinetic’s assets were sold to privately held Braingate, Inc.&lt;ref name="Braingate gets a new lease on life"/&gt;

In early 2009, Cyberkinetics was acquired by [http://www.blackrockmicro.com/ Blackrock Microsystems, LLC].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2009/07/prweb2643164.htm|title=Blackrock Microsystems Obtains Expanded 510(k) to Market NeuroPort System|date=15 July 2009|work=PRWeb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinical trials==

'''William Fritz Afflis''' (June 27, 1929 – November 10, 1991) was an [[Americans|American]] [[professional wrestler]] and [[American football|football]] player, better known by his [[ring name]], '''Dick the Bruiser'''.

==Early life==
Born in [[Delphi, Indiana]], he moved to [[Indianapolis]] when his mother got a job there during World War II. Afflis played football during his freshman and sophomore years for [[Shortridge High School]] in Indianapolis. After his mother lost her job, the family moved back to Delphi, and the high school there did not have a football team. Afflis took up residence at the [[YMCA]] in nearby [[Lafayette, Indiana]], so that he was eligible to attend  [[Jefferson High School (Indiana)|Lafayette Jefferson High School]] where he played football and wrestled.&lt;ref name=Book&gt;{{cite news | last =Thompson | first = Ken| title =Book captures spirit of 'Dick the Bruiser' | newspaper = [[Journal &amp; Courier]]| location =[[Lafayette, Indiana]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date =April 22, 2016 | url =http://www.jconline.com/story/sports/2016/04/22/book-captures-spirit-dick-bruiser/83356406/ | accessdate =July 15, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Afflis went on to attend [[Purdue University]]&lt;ref name=Dictionary/&gt; and the [[University of Nevada, Reno]],&lt;ref name=Star/&gt; playing varsity [[American football|football]] at both schools. He also worked as a bouncer at a Reno nightclub.

==American football career==
Selected 186th overall in the 16th round of the 1951 professional football draft,&lt;ref name=Dictionary/&gt;  Afflis played [[American football|football]] for the [[Green Bay Packers]] from 1951 to 1954.&lt;ref name =Newsday/&gt; as a [[Lineman (gridiron football)|lineman]].&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia/&gt; He appeared in all 48 regular season games the Packers played in those years, although the team never finished better than fourth place.&lt;ref name=Dictionary/&gt; Afflis suffered an injury to his larynx while playing for the Packers that left him with a gravelly voice for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=Star&gt;{{cite news | last =Mitchell | first =Dawn | title =Dick the Bruiser: 'World's most dangerous wrestler' | newspaper =[[Indianapolis Star]] | location = | pages = | language = | publisher = | date =November 19, 2015 | url =https://www.indystar.com/story/news/history/retroindy/2015/11/19/dick-bruiser-worlds-most-dangerous-wrestler/75993686/ | accessdate =July 15, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional wrestling career==
Afflis started wrestling in Chicago in 1955 under the Bruiser moniker where he faced [[Verne Gagne]] and [[Lou Thesz]]. Gagne had trained him to become a  professional wrestler.&lt;ref name=Dictionary/&gt;

From then into the late 1950s, Dick the Bruiser wrestled live every Thursday on TV in the Detroit area. His typical opponent was "an up and coming young (unknown) wrestler" who would be [[Squash (professional wrestling)|pulverized]] by the Bruiser. His matches and interviews were so effective he became a household name in the Detroit area. His only defeat on live TV was at the hands of Cowboy Bob Ellis. However, in two rematches with Ellis at the Olympia in Detroit, the Bruiser was victorious.  A real bar fight with football player [[Alex Karras]]  gained Afflis attention, which resulted in several more fights.

On November 19, 1957, Dick the Bruiser and [[Dr. Jerry Graham]] engaged in a tag team match at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City before a crowd reported as 12,987 fans. Their opponents were [[Antonino Rocca]] and [[Édouard Carpentier]]. After the match ended, fighting among the wrestlers continued, and a large number of fans joined in, leading to a riot. Two policemen were injured, two fans were arrested and over 60 policemen had difficulty dispersing the angry crowd. The floor of the arena was littered with hundreds of broken chairs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =White Jr. | first = Gordon S.| title =Wrestling Ends in Riot at Garden: 2 Policemen Hurt as Fans Storm Ring and Throw Chairs and Bottles| newspaper = [[New York Times]] | location = | pages = | language = | publisher = | date =November 20, 1957 | url =https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1957/11/20/102283794.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Archives&amp;module=ArticleEndCTA&amp;region=ArchiveBody&amp;pgtype=article&amp;pageNumber=29| accessdate = July 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Dick the Bruiser was banned for life by the [[New York State Athletic Commission]].&lt;ref name=Dictionary&gt;{{cite book | last =Grasso | first =John | authorlink = | title =Historical Dictionary of Wrestling | publisher =[[Scarecrow Press]] | series = | volume = | edition = | date =2014 | location = | pages = | language = | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=KUsJAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA80&amp;dq=William+Fritz+Afflis&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj4tf76iZ7cAhVExlQKHWoAAggQ6AEIKzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=William%20Fritz%20Afflis&amp;f=false| doi = | id = | isbn =9780810879263 | mr = | zbl = | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Afflis, along with fellow wrestler and business partner [[Wilbur Snyder]], purchased the Indianapolis NWA promotion in 1964 from its longtime owner [[Jim Barnett (wrestling)|Jim Barnett]]. Afflis renamed the territory the [[World Wrestling Association (Indianapolis)|World Wrestling Association]] (WWA) and promoted himself as its champion. While he ran it as an independent promotion with its own titles and champion, the WWA had a working agreement with the larger [[American Wrestling Association|AWA]] (owned by wrestler Verne Gagne), sharing talent and recognizing their championships. This agreement benefited both promotions and led to the Bruiser having five AWA Tag-Team Title reigns, with [[tag team]] partner, [[The Crusher (wrestler)|The Crusher]],&lt;ref name =Newsday&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | title =Pro football players who became pro wrestlers | newspaper =[[Newsday]] | location = | pages = | language = | publisher = | date =August 30, 2016 | url =https://www.newsday.com/sports/pro-wrestling/nfl-and-other-pro-football-players-who-became-pro-wrestlers-1.9208379 | accessdate =July 13, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who was billed as his "cousin".

The Bruiser was the first to christen Manager [[Bobby Heenan]] with  the nickname of "The Weasel"&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia&gt;{{cite book|title=WWE Encyclopedia|last1=Shields|first1=Brian|last2=Sullivan|first2=Kevin|page=79|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley|DK]]|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7566-4190-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; during his run in the territory. Afflis' WWA ran from 1964 until 1989, when Afflis finally tired of losing talent, TV, and fan attendance to the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF).

Afflis, with his charisma, NFL notoriety, and gravelly-voiced, tough-guy persona was a legitimate cross-media star, becoming something of a hero in the Indianapolis area. He made his home on the northwest side of the city. Indianapolis native [[David Letterman]] would later name [[Late Night with David Letterman|his television show]]'s band [[CBS Orchestra#The World's Most Dangerous Band|The World's Most Dangerous Band]] as a derivation of Dick the Bruiser's nickname, "The World's Most Dangerous Wrestler." The moniker "Dick the Bruiser" was even used in the 1980s by George Baier, a co-host of the morning drive show on Detroit rock radio station [[WRIF]]. Baier's "Richard T. Bruiser" was an effective, entertaining impersonation of Afflis, who actually played himself in a number of popular TV ads for WRIF.

After retiring, Afflis was a color commentator for the [[Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling]] (GLOW), founded by [[David McLane]], who had previously risen through the ranks as a teenager to manage the WWA for The Bruiser.  He also worked as a talent agent for [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW), and was the [[Referee (professional wrestling)#Special guest referee|special guest referee]] at the [[Starrcade 1990]] main event between [[Steve Borden|Sting]] and the [[The Black Scorpion (professional wrestling)|Black Scorpion]].

==Death==
Afflis died of [[internal bleeding]] on November 10, 1991, according to a spokesman for Suncoast Hospital in Largo, Florida, near his winter home. His widow, Louise, said her husband had been weightlifting at home with his adopted son, Jon Carney, and ruptured a [[blood vessel]] in his esophagus. He was entombed at Washington Park North Cemetery in Indianapolis.

[[File:Alitta succinea (epitoke).jpg|thumb|right|200px|''[[Alitta succinea]]'' (common clam worm) in epitoky stage]]

'''Epitoky''' is a process that occurs in many species of [[polychaete]] marine worms wherein a sexually immature worm (the '''atoke''') is modified or transformed into a sexually mature worm (the '''epitoke'''). Epitokes are [[pelagic]] [[morph (zoology)|morphs]] capable of [[sexual reproduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pechenik|first=Jan I.|title=Biology of the Invertebrates, Seventh Edition|year=2015|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-07-352418-4|pages=302–304}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the immature form, which is typically [[benthic]] (lives on the bottom), epitokes are specialized for swimming as well as reproducing. The primary benefit to epitoky is increased chances of finding other members of the same species for reproduction.

There are two methods in which epitoky can occur:  '''schizogamy''' and '''epigamy'''.

==Schizogamy==

Many species go through '''schizogamy''', where the atoke uses [[asexual reproduction]] to produce buds from its posterior end. Each bud develops into an epitoke and, once fully formed, will then break off from the atoke and become free-swimming. Many genetically identical epitokes are formed in this way, thus allowing a higher chance of finding a mate of the same species and subsequent passing of genes to the next generation. Atokes may then live through another season to form more epitokes.

==Epigamy==
[[File:PlatynereisDumeriliiAtoke.tif|thumb|right|200px| Atoke of ''[[Platynereis dumerilii]]'': It is yellowish-brown]]
[[File:PlatynereisDumeriliiFemaleEpitoke.tif|thumb|right|200px|Female epitoke of ''[[Platynereis dumerilii]]'': Its body is filled with yellow eggs.]]

'''Epigamy''' is another common way to form epitokes. For species that use this method, the atoke undergoes physiological and morphological modifications as it transforms into the epitoke.&lt;ref name="Chatelain"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cbpb.2007.09.006 |last=Chatelain|first=Étienne Hébert|last2=Breton|first2=Sophie|last3=Lemieux|first3=Hélène|last4=Blier|first4=Pierre U.|title=Epitoky in ''Nereis'' (''Neanthes'') ''virens'' (Polychaeta: Nereididae): A story about sex and death |journal=Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology B |volume=149 |issue=2008 |pages=202–208 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, male worms undergo a more pronounced transformation from atoke to epitoke. Modifications may include an increase in size of [[parapodia]] and the development of paddle-like [[chaeta]]e for enhanced swimming ability, [[atrophy]] of the gut, filling of the body cavity with [[gametes]] ([[egg cell|eggs]] or [[sperm]]), the development of large eyes, and the musculature may even change to perform swimming movements instead of feeding movements.&lt;ref name="Chatelain" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dorresteign"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dorresteijn|first=Adriaan W.C.|last2=Westheide|first2=Wilfried|title=Reproductive Strategies and Developmental Patterns in Annelids|year=2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9789401728874}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of species that undergo epigamy are unable to revert to the atoke form and die after reproducing.

Male and female epitokes are produced and swim to the water's surface only at certain times of the year and are often synchronized with moon cycles in a behavior called '''swarming'''. Swarming brings individuals of the same species together so that there is an increased rate of fertilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Karleskint|first=George|last2=Turner|first2=Richard|last3=Small|first3=James|title=Introduction to Marine Biology, Third Edition|year=2009|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=9780495561972|pages=237}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some polychaete species have been found to use [[bioluminescence]], presumably to compact and maintain swarms.&lt;ref name="Dorresteign" /&gt; Both schizogamous and epigamous epitokes are non-feeding individuals that die once [[gametes]] have been released into the water.

In the past, epitokes were thought to be a separate group of [[polychaete]] marine worms, because epitokes may look very different than atokes. For instance, the atokes of [[Platynereis dumerilii]] are yellowish-brown, while the female epitokes are yellow because of the eggs they contain, and the male epitokes are white in the front part due to sperm and red in the hind part due to blood vessels&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fischer|first1=Antje HL|last2=Henrich|first2=Thorsten|last3=Arendt|first3=Detlev|title=The normal development of Platynereis dumerilii (Nereididae, Annelida)|journal=Frontiers in Zoology|date=2010|volume=7|issue=1|pages=31|doi=10.1186/1742-9994-7-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see pictures).

In [[philosophy]], '''essence''' is the property or set of properties that make an entity or [[substance theory|substance]] what it fundamentally is, and which it has by [[metaphysical necessity|necessity]], and without which it loses its [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]]. Essence is contrasted with [[accident (philosophy)|accident]]: a property that the entity or substance has [[metaphysical contingency|contingently]], without which the substance can still retain its identity.  The concept originates rigorously with Aristotle (although it can also be found in Plato)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/euthyfro.html|title=The Internet Classics Archive {{!}} Euthyphro by Plato|website=classics.mit.edu|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;, who used the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] expression ''to ti ên einai'' (τὸ τί ἦν εἶναι,&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]], ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', 1029b&lt;/ref&gt; literally meaning "the what it was to be" and corresponding to the [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] term [[quiddity]]) or sometimes the shorter phrase ''to ti esti'' (τὸ τί ἐστι,&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'', 1030a&lt;/ref&gt; literally meaning "the what it is" and corresponding to the scholastic term [[haecceity]]) for the same idea. This phrase presented such difficulties for its Latin translators that they coined the word ''essentia'' (English "essence") to represent the whole expression. For Aristotle and his scholastic followers, the notion of essence is closely linked to that of definition (ὁρισμός ''[[horismos]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-metaphysicys/ S. Marc Cohen, "Aristotle's Metaphysics"], [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], accessed 20 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the history of western thought, essence has often served as a vehicle for doctrines that tend to individuate different forms of existence as well as different identity conditions for objects and properties; in this logical meaning, the concept has given a strong theoretical and common-sense basis to the whole family of logical theories based on the "possible worlds" analogy set up by [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] and developed in the intensional logic from [[Rudolf Carnap|Carnap]] to [[Saul Kripke|Kripke]], which was later challenged by "extensionalist" philosophers such as [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]].

==Ontological status&lt;!--Linked from 'Étienne Gilson'--&gt;==
In his dialogues [[Plato]] suggests that concrete beings acquire their essence through their relations to "[[Theory of Forms|Forms]]"{{mdash}}abstract universals logically or ontologically separate from the objects of sense perception. These Forms are often put forth as the models or paradigms  of which sensible things are "copies". When used in this sense, the word form is often capitalized.&lt;ref&gt;"Chapter 28: Form" of ''The Great Ideas: A Synopticon of Great Books of the Western World'' (Vol. II). ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' (1952), p. 526-542. This source states that Form or Idea get capitalized according to this convention when they refer "to that which is separate from the characteristics of material things and from the ideas in our mind."&lt;/ref&gt; Sensible bodies are in constant flux and imperfect and hence, by Plato's reckoning, less real than the Forms which are eternal, unchanging and complete. Typical examples of Forms given by Plato are largeness, smallness, equality, unity, goodness, beauty and justice.

[[Aristotle]] moves the Forms of Plato to the nucleus of the individual thing, which is called ''[[ousia]]'' or substance. Essence is the ''ti'' of the thing, the ''[[to ti en einai]]''. Essence corresponds to the ''ousia'''s definition; essence is a real and physical aspect of the ''ousia'' (Aristotle, ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', I).

According to [[nominalists]] ([[Roscelin of Compiègne]], [[William of Ockham]], [[Bernard of Chartres]]), universals aren't concrete entities, just voice's sounds; there are only individuals: "''nam cum habeat eorum sententia nihil esse praeter individuum [...]''" (Roscelin, ''De gener. et spec.'', 524). Universals are words that can to call several individuals; for example the word "homo". Therefore, a universal is reduced to a sound's emission (Roscelin, ''De generibus et speciebus'').

[[John Locke]] distinguished between "real essences" and "nominal essences". Real essences are the thing(s) that makes a thing a thing, whereas nominal essences are our conception of what makes a thing a thing.&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/real-essence/&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Edmund Husserl]] essence is ''ideal''. However, ''ideal'' means that essence is an intentional object of consciousness. Essence is interpreted as ''sense'' (E. Husserl, ''Ideas pertaining to a pure phenomenology and to a phenomenological philosophy'', paragraphs 3 and 4).

==Existentialism==
{{main|Meaning (existential)}}
[[Existentialism]] was coined by [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s endorsement of [[Martin Heidegger|Martin Heidegger's]] statement that for human beings "[[existence precedes essence]]."  In as much as "essence" is a cornerstone of all [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] philosophy and of [[Rationalism]], Sartre's statement was a repudiation of the philosophical system that had come before him (and, in particular, that of [[Husserl]], [[Hegel]], and [[Heidegger]]).  Instead of "is-ness" generating "actuality," he argued that existence and actuality come first, and the essence is derived afterward. For [[Kierkegaard]], it is the individual person who is the supreme moral entity, and the personal, subjective aspects of human life that are the most important; also, for Kierkegaard all of this had religious implications.&lt;ref&gt;''The Story of Philosophy'', Bryan Magee, Dorling Kindersley Lond. 1998, {{ISBN|0-7513-0590-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In metaphysics==
"Essence," in metaphysics, is often synonymous with the [[soul]], and some existentialists argue that individuals gain their souls and spirits after they exist, that they develop their souls and spirits during their lifetimes.  For Kierkegaard, however, the emphasis was upon essence as "nature."  For him, there is no such thing as "human nature" that determines how a human will behave or what a human will be.  First, he or she exists, and then comes property.  [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s more materialist and skeptical existentialism furthered this existentialist tenet by flatly refuting any metaphysical essence, any soul, and arguing instead that there is merely existence, with attributes as essence.

Thus, in existentialist discourse, essence can refer to physical aspect or property to the ongoing being of a person (the character or internally determined goals), or to the infinite inbound within the human (which can be lost, can atrophy, or can be developed into an equal part with the finite), depending upon the type of existentialist discourse.

==Marxism's essentialism==

[[Karl Marx]] was a follower of [[Hegel]]'s thought, and he, too, developed a philosophy in reaction to his master. In his early work, Marx used [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] style [[teleology]] and derived a concept of humanity's essential nature. Marx's [[Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844]] describe [[Marx's theory of alienation|a theory of alienation]] based on human existence being completely different from human essence.  Marx said human nature was social, and that humanity had the distinct essence of free activity and conscious thought.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Some scholars, such as Philip Kain, have argued that Marx abandoned the idea of a human essence, but many other scholars point to Marx's continued discussion of these ideas despite the decline of terms such as essence and alienation in his later work.

==Buddhism==
Within the [[Madhyamaka]] school of [[Mahayana]] [[Buddhism]], [[Candrakirti]] identifies the [[Atman (Buddhism)|self]] as:{{quote|an essence of things that does not depend on others; it is an intrinsic nature. The non-existence of that is [[Anatta|selflessness]].| {{IAST|'''Bodhisattvayogacaryācatuḥśatakaṭikā'''}} 256.1.7&lt;ref name="Lam Rim"&gt;Translations from "The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path of Enlightenment", Vol. 3 by Tsong-Kha-Pa, Snow Lion Publications {{ISBN|1-55939-166-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Buddhapālita]] adds, while commenting on [[Nagarjuna|Nagārjuna]]'s [[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]], {{quote|What is the reality of things just as it is? It is the absence of essence. Unskilled persons whose eye of intelligence is obscured by the darkness of delusion conceive of an essence of things and then generate attachment and hostility with regard to them.|{{IAST|''Buddhapālita-mula-madhyamaka-vrtti''}}, P5242, 73.5.6-74.1.2&lt;ref name="Lam Rim"/&gt;}}

For the [[Madhyamaka]] Buddhists, '[[Shunyata|Emptiness]]' (also known as [[Anatta|Anatta or Anatman]]) is the strong assertion that all phenomena are empty of any essence, and that anti-essentialism lies at the root of Buddhist praxis and it is the innate belief in essence that is considered to be an afflictive obscuration which serves as the root of [[Samsara|all suffering]]. However, the [[Madhyamaka]] also rejects the tenets of [[Idealism]], [[Materialism]] or [[Cārvāka#No life after death|Nihilism]]; instead, the ideas of ''truth'' or ''existence'', along with any assertions that depend upon them are limited to their function within the contexts and conventions that assert them, possibly somewhat akin to [[Relativism]] or [[Pragmatism]]. For the [[Madhyamaka]], replacement paradoxes such as [[Ship of Theseus]] are answered by stating that the Ship of Theseus remains so (within the conventions that assert it) until it ceases to function as the Ship of Theseus.

In [[Nagarjuna]]'s [[Mulamadhyamakakarika]] Chapter XV examines essence itself.

==Hinduism==

In understanding any individual personality, a distinction is made between one's ''Swadharma'' (essence) and ''Swabhava'' (mental habits and conditionings of ego personality). Svabhava is the nature of a person, which is a result of his or her samskaras (impressions created in the mind due to one's interaction with the external world). These samskaras create habits and mental models and those become our nature. While there is another kind of svabhava that is a pure internal quality — [[Simran (Sanskrit word)|smarana]] — we are here focusing only on the svabhava that was created due to samskaras (because to discover the pure, internal svabhava and smarana, one should become aware of one's samskaras and take control over them). [[Dharma]] is derived from the root ''dhr'' "to hold." It is that which holds an entity together. That is, Dharma is that which gives integrity to an entity and holds the core quality and identity (essence), form and function of that entity. Dharma is also defined as righteousness and duty. To do one's dharma is to be righteous, to do one's dharma is to do one's duty (express one's essence).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prasadkaipa.com/blog/archives/2005/07/svabhava_and_sv.php Prasadkaipa.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent generations are called '''F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''', etc.

The offspring of distinctly different parental types produce a new, uniform [[phenotype]] with a combination of characteristics from the parents. In fish breeding, those parents frequently are two closely related fish species, while in plant and animal breeding the parents often are two [[inbred line]]s. [[Mule]]s are F1 hybrids between [[horse]] and [[donkey]]. Today, certain domestic&amp;ndash;wild hybrid breeds, such as the [[Bengal (cat) |Bengal cat]] and the [[Savannah (cat)|Savannah cat]], are classified by their filial generation number.

[[Gregor Mendel]] focused on patterns of [[inheritance]] and the [[genetics|genetic]] basis for [[variation (genetics)|variation]]. In his [[cross-pollination]] experiments involving two true-breeding, or [[homozygous]], parents, Mendel found that the resulting F1 generation were [[heterozygous]] and consistent. The offspring showed a combination of the phenotypes from each parent that were genetically [[dominance (genetics)|dominant]]. Mendel’s discoveries involving the F1 and F2 generations laid the foundation for modern genetics.

==Production of F1 hybrids==
=== In plants ===

Crossing two genetically different plants produces a [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] [[seed]]. This can happen naturally, and includes hybrids between species (for example, [[peppermint]] is a [[sterility (physiology)|sterile]] F1 hybrid of [[Mentha aquatica|watermint]] and [[spearmint]]). In [[agronomy]], the term “F1 hybrid” is usually reserved for agricultural [[cultivar]]s derived from two parent cultivars. These F1 hybrids are usually created by means of controlled [[pollination]], sometimes by [[hand-pollination]]. For [[annual plant]]s such as tomato and [[maize]], F1 hybrids must be produced each season.

For mass-production of F1 hybrids with uniform [[phenotype]], the parent plants must have predictable genetic effects on the offspring. [[Inbreeding]] and selection for uniformity for multiple generations ensures that the parent lines are almost [[homozygous]]. The divergence between the (two) parent lines promotes improved growth and yield characteristics in offspring through the phenomenon of [[heterosis]] ("hybrid vigour" or "combining ability").

Two [[population]]s of breeding stock with desired characteristics are subjected to [[inbreeding]] until the homozygosity of the population exceeds a certain level, usually 90% or more.  Typically this requires more than ten generations. Thereafter the two strains must be crossed, while avoiding [[self-fertilization]]. Normally this is done with plants by deactivating or removing male flowers from one population, taking advantage of time differences between male and female flowering or hand-pollinating.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tomclothier.hort.net/seedsav4.html Hand Pollination]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, 99 percent of all [[corn]] planted in the [[United States]], 95 percent of [[sugar beet]], 80 percent of [[spinach]], 80 percent of [[sunflower]], 62 percent of [[broccoli]] and 60 percent of [[onion]]s were F1 hybrids.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} Beans and peas are not commercially hybridized because they are [[automatic pollinator]]s, and hand-pollination is prohibitively expensive.

==== F2 hybrid ====

F2 hybrids, the result of self or cross pollination of F1s, lack the consistency of F1s, though they may retain some desirable traits and can be produced more cheaply, because hand pollination or other interventions are not required. Some seed companies offer F2 seed at less cost, particularly in [[Bedding (horticulture)|bedding plants]] where consistency is less critical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lawrence D. Hills |year=1987 |title=F2 and open pollinated varieties |volume=1 |issue=2 | url=http://www.thompson-morgan.com/f2-and-open-pollinated-varieties |journal=Growing From Seed (The Seed Raising Journal from Thompson &amp; Morgan)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In animals ===

F1 crosses in animals can be between two inbred lines or between two closely related species or subspecies. In such fish as [[cichlid]]s, the term F1 cross is used for crosses between two different wild-caught individuals that are assumed to be from different genetic lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigskycichlids.com/newfish_articlex.htm|title=Guide to selecting and breeding high quality cichlids|publisher=bigskycichlids.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages ==

* Homogeneity and predictability—The genes of individual plant or animal F1 offspring of homozygous [[pure line]]s display limited variation, making their phenotype uniform and therefore attractive for mechanical operations and easing fine [[population]] management. Once the characteristics of the cross are known, repeating this cross yields exactly the same result.
* Higher performance—As most [[allele]]s code for different versions of a [[protein]] or [[enzyme]], having two different versions of this allele amounts to having two different versions of the enzyme. This increases the likelihood of an optimal version of the enzyme being present and reduces the likelihood of a [[genetic defect]]. 

== Disadvantages ==

* The main advantage of F1 hybrids in agriculture is also their drawback. When F1 cultivars are used as parents, their offspring (F2 generation) vary greatly from one another.  Some F2s are high in homozygous genes, as found in their grandparents, and these will lack hybrid vigour. From the point of view of a commercial seed producer who does not wish customers to produce their own seed via [[seed saving]], this [[genetic assortment]] is a desired characteristic.
* Both inbreeding and crossing the ancestral lines of the hybrid are costly {{how ?|date=December 2017}}, which translates into a much higher price{{source needed|date=December 2017}}. Not all crop species exhibit a sufficiently high heterosis effect to offset this disadvantage.
* F1 hybrids mature at the same time when raised under the same environmental conditions. They all ripen simultaneously and can be more easily harvested by machine. Traditional cultivars and [[landrace]]s are often more useful to gardeners because they crop over a longer period of time, avoiding gluts and food shortages {{source needed|date=December 2017}}.

'''Fantomex''' is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is commonly associated with the [[X-Men]] titles. Fantomex first appeared in ''[[X-Men: Legacy#New X-Men|New X-Men]]'' #128 (August, 2002) and was created by [[Grant Morrison]] and [[Igor Kordey]]. Initially introduced as a character similar to [[Fantômas]] and [[Diabolik]], he is later revealed to be an escaped experiment from the [[Weapon Plus]] Program.

==Publication history==
Fantomex resembles the titular character of the [[Italian comics|Italian comic book]] ''[[Diabolik]]'' and its film adaptation ''[[Danger: Diabolik]]''. The character of Diabolik is loosely based on the character [[Fantômas]], the subject of a series of early-20th century [[France|French]] detective thrillers and a popular Mexican comic book adaptation, whose name is more directly reflected in Fantomex's own name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2006/08/31/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-66/ Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #66], [[Comic Book Resources]]&lt;/ref&gt; Fantomex's name, Jean-Phillipe, is a reference to actor [[John Phillip Law]], star of "Danger: Diabolik". In addition, his Weapon X designation—"Weapon XIII"—is a reference to the secret agent protagonist of the Franco-Belgian comic ''[[XIII (comics)|XIII]]''.

After Morrison's run, the character made sporadic appearances in ''[[Weapon X (comic book)|Weapon X]]'' #23–25, ''[[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]]'' #20–21, 24, the ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]: The List—Wolverine'' one-shot and in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #515–522 during the "[[Nation X]]" storyline before becoming a founding member of a new covert X-Force as seen in the monthly ''[[Uncanny X-Force]]'' series.

In July 2013, Marvel announced the character's first solo series, ''Fantomex MAX'', written by Andrew Hope, and illustrated by Shawn Crystal.  The series does not take place in current Marvel continuity, and the character is not affiliated with any other Marvel characters.  In this series, the character of Fantomex is a more literal take on the Diabolik character, with a storyline less influenced by traditional superhero plots, skewing more towards the concepts  of intrigue and James Bond-tinged adventure.  Issue #1 debuted on October 2, 2013.

==Fictional character biography==

===Origin===
Fantomex was created by the [[Weapon Plus]] Program to serve as a [[Sentinels (comics)|super-sentinel]] against Earth's mutant population. Weapon Plus created a population of [[Techno-organic material|technorganic]] organisms whose living tissue was fused with Sentinel [[nanotechnology]] at the [[Nanochondrion|cellular]] level. His mother, a member of this race, became pregnant when she was fertilized with [[Nanorobotics|nanomachine]]s, resulting in the birth of Fantomex. Like the rest of his people, he was born and raised in [[Weapon Plus#The World|the World]], a man-made environment designed to create super-sentinels, media-friendly mutant-hunters modeled after [[Saturday morning cartoon]]s. Although his nationality is technically British as the World was located in England, Fantomex claims he was raised in a virtual France with imperfect programming.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Force #13&lt;/ref&gt; He's developed a French sense of identity and persona; whereas his experiment designation at the World facility was "Charlie Cluster-7", he usually goes by the name "Jean-Phillipe".

===New X-Men===
During his first appearance, Fantomex seeks a safe haven at the [[X-Corporation]] in Paris while fleeing from authorities. He claims to be a mutant thief with the ill-defined power of misdirection. Bleeding profusely from bullet wounds, he asks for asylum, which [[Professor X]] grants him. Fantomex explains to Professor X and [[Jean Grey]] that he is being hunted because he is one of the most wanted thieves in Europe. Neither Professor X nor Jean Grey are able to verify his claims due to his ceramic mask, a device that blocks their mental probes. However, they agree to aid him, and after escaping the soldiers who surround the building, Fantomex uses his ship E.V.A. (named, in yet another reference, after Diabolik's lover [[Eva Kant]]) to take Professor X and Jean Grey to his home in France. While there, he introduces them to his mother and continues to describe his success as a thief. In fact, he tells the two that he has stolen sensitive information about the Weapon Plus project while in the [[Channel Tunnel]], and offers to sell it to Professor Xavier for $1 billion. After submitting his proposal, he puts himself in a light hypnotic trance and removes the bullets that riddle his body. Finished, he asks Professor X and Jean Grey to accompany him back to the Chunnel in an effort to destroy [[Weapon XII]]. The three speed away in E.V.A., leaving the house and elderly woman behind.

Fantomex then leads Professor Xavier and Jean Grey to the Chunnel disaster. Packed full of people and animals that Weapon XII has turned into mindless slaves, confusion runs rampant. Knowing that those who have fallen prey to Weapon XII's influence are lost, Fantomex kills [[Darkstar (comics)|Darkstar]] and all others who are mentally connected to the creature. After Fantomex destroys Weapon XII by using a remote detonator, it is noticed that there are two empty Weapon Plus transport tubes in the Chunnel: one that held the violent Weapon XII and another that held something called Weapon XIII. After the battle, Fantomex's ceramic mask slips a bit and Jean Grey uses her telepathy to deduce his true identity: Fantomex is actually Weapon XIII and had also been in transit in the Chunnel. It was during the accident in the Chunnel that he escaped and was subsequently chased to the X-Corporation building. He confesses to Jean Grey that he is not the master thief that he had claimed, but is now set out to earn that reputation. He assures Jean Grey that he refuses to be anyone's soldier, and as a result Jean Grey allows Fantomex to disappear into the Chunnel before the authorities arrive.

Fantomex later travels to Afghanistan in an attempt to steal a list of the world's richest mutant slaver traders, the names on which he intends to blackmail. There he encounters an unconscious mutant known as [[Dust (comics)|Dust]], a former captive who unwittingly killed her captors by turning into a deadly sandstorm. Upon his exit, he encounters [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], leaving Dust in his care.&lt;ref&gt;''New X-Men'' #133&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after, Fantomex contacts Wolverine and offers him information about his mysterious past if he helps Fantomex destroy Ultimaton, also known as Weapon XV, the last creation of the Weapon Plus Program. Fantomex, Wolverine, and the X-Men's [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] travel to the World, an artificial, time-altering environment designed by Weapon Plus to quickly develop and evolve new generations of super-soldiers.

The three are defeated by Weapon XV (Ultimaton), who escapes by breaking through the barriers of the World and flying to the Weapon Plus space station. The team pursues their target in E.V.A., Fantomex's biological spacecraft. Upon arriving at the space station Fantomex keeps his word by showing Wolverine the complete Weapon Plus database. Shocked at learning the terrible details of his past (including his role in the slaughter of the entire population of Roanoke while under the influence of [[Weapon X]]), Wolverine initiates the self-destruct sequence for the space station before catching and apparently killing Ultimaton (who reappears later as a subordinate&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate X-Force'' #5&lt;/ref&gt;). Fantomex and Cyclops escape the explosion in one of the station's shuttles.&lt;ref&gt;''New X-Men'' #145&lt;/ref&gt;

Back on Earth, Fantomex joins Cyclops and a group of X-Men students in their fight against [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], who had taken the identity of [[Xorn]]. He had gathered a new [[Brotherhood of Mutants]] and had taken over New York City. With the aid of [[Barnell Bohusk|Beak]], Fantomex, and the others were able to break into Xorn's skyscraper headquarters and bring him down.&lt;ref&gt;''New X-Men'' #150&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weapon X and Mystique===
Later on, Fantomex tries to track down [[John Sublime]], the director of the Weapon Plus program. However, upon examining his empty grave, Fantomex finds a note reading, "Roanoke."&lt;ref&gt;''Weapon X'' #23&lt;/ref&gt;  He locates the secret facility of the splinter program [[Weapon X]] and finds it abandoned except for [[David North (comics)|Agent Zero]]. The pair reluctantly joins forces and travels to the site of Roanoke, a town whose inhabitants were slaughtered after Weapon X unleashed a brainwashed Wolverine on them years earlier. There, the three finally encounter Sublime but are opposed by his [[U-Men (comics)|U-Men]] and forced to flee against overwhelming odds. In an attempt to escape in E.V.A., Fantomex is shot down and left for dead.&lt;ref&gt;''Weapon X'' #25&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Fantomex manages to survive and some time later is contacted by the diminutive mutant [[Shortpack]] who seeks his help in assassinating mutant arms dealer Steinbeck, also known as the [[Prudence Leighton|Quiet Man]], in revenge for his killing of an agent under Shortpack's care. Fantomex refuses, not wanting to become responsible for allowing the good-natured Shortpack to become a killer. Shortpack is captured by Steinbeck soon after, and whilst investigating his disappearance the shapechanging mutant [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]], a double agent for both Xavier and Steinbeck's ally Shepard, learns of his meeting with Fantomex. Though despising him after a past encounter in Madagascar, Mystique finds Fantomex in Monte Carlo, once again operating under the pretense of being a mutant thief, and learns of Shortpack's plan.&lt;ref&gt;''Mystique'' #20&lt;/ref&gt;  As she leaves to rescue him, Fantomex follows and uncovers her intent to assassinate Xavier. In exchange for his silence, Fantomex bids Mystique perform a heist for him. After she returns with the stolen goods (a vintage Spider-Man costume), Mystique infects both Fantomex and E.V.A. with a techno-organic virus, seemingly killing them both to keep her plan secret.&lt;ref&gt;''Mystique'' #21&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it was all a ruse as Mystique knew she was being monitored by Shepard. Fantomex later resurfaces and helps Mystique capture Shepard, giving her access to Steinbeck whom she finally defeats.&lt;ref&gt;''Mystique'' #24&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dark Reign, Nation X, and Second Coming===
During his tenure as leader of HAMMER, [[Norman Osborn]] tries to take control of the World and the Weapon Plus creations. Wolverine and [[Noh-Varr]] head to the World to try to stop Norman Osborn but are soon attacked by a large army of Weapon Plus creations infected by Allgod (Weapon XVI), the living religion. Noh-Varr is rescued by Fantomex (who has apparently spent all the time since his last appearance "stealing things mostly" and admits he should have kept an eye on the World), and the two of them make their way to the World's brain (now a sentient being) where they are confronted by the Allgod drones, Wolverine included. Fantomex is not affected by Allgod because nanites in his neocortex render him incapable of believing in anything greater than himself. Noh-Varr is able to disarm Allgod by kissing the World's brain, thus showing it some compassion, and disabling Allgod. Immediately after this, the three of them defeat Osborn's invading army of [[Deathlok]] prototypes. Fantomex then uses a shrink-ray he reportedly stole from [[Doctor Doom]] to shrink the World and take it for his own.&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Reign: The List—Wolverine''&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon afterwards Fantomex is hired by a young mutant boy to hunt a rogue [[Predator X (Marvel Comics)|Predator X]] stalking mutants beneath New York City.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #519&lt;/ref&gt;  After dealing with the Predator X, Fantomex and E.V.A. run into Wolverine, [[Psylocke]], and [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], who ask for his help to defeat the creators of the Predator X. Fantomex initially turns their request down, but is later convinced by the same young boy he helped to help the X-Men. Fantomex saves the team from a group of John Sublime's associates and later takes them home.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #521&lt;/ref&gt;

Fantomex remains with the X-Men on Utopia and is later seen in San Francisco fighting alongside the X-Men against [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion's]] army of [[Nimrod (comics)|Nimrod]] sentinels.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #525&lt;/ref&gt; Once the battle is over, he's shown to have secretly joined a new iteration of [[X-Force]], alongside Wolverine, [[Archangel (comics)|Archangel]], Psylocke, and [[Deadpool]].&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men: Second Coming'' #2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uncanny X-Force===
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:X-Force Psylocke.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Fantomex with [[Psylocke]] in ''[[Uncanny X-Force]]'' #12: "Dark Angel Saga, Chapter 2: Interruption" (art by Chris Stevens)]] --&gt;

The first mission of the new team is an assassination job to kill [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]], reborn in the form of a child and being indoctrinated by [[Clan Akkaba]] on their Moon base.  After defeating Apocalypse's Final Horsemen and getting to the young Apocalypse, no one on the team can summon up the courage to kill a child.  When the group resigns to bring the child back with them and to reeducate him, Fantomex fires a shot in the child's head, apparently killing him.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Force'' #4&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon afterwards, Fantomex realizes a presence calling itself Weapon Infinity has started manipulating the timestream within the World. After a battle against Weapon Infinity (actually the transforming of all future heroes into time-travelling [[Deathlok]]-type cyborgs &lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Force #5&lt;/ref&gt;), it is revealed that Fantomex has actually cloned the Apocalypse child in order to see if the boy could become a hero if raised as a good man in a virtual environment deep within the World.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Force'' #19&lt;/ref&gt;

Fantomex is later abducted by [[Captain Britain]] who brands him a dimensional threat and take him to Otherworld, where an interdimensional court sentences him to erasure from existence itself. He is rescued by his teammate Psylocke, who turns against her brothers. Together they encounter the [[Skinless Man]] and rejoin their teammates to defeat The Goat, a corrupted future incarnation of Psylocke and Captain Britain's older brother [[Jamie Braddock]], who attempted to consume the [[multiverse]].&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Force'' #20 - 24&lt;/ref&gt;

When Psylocke is captured by the newly reformed Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, Fantomex sacrifices himself to save her. He is captured and killed when the Skinless Man cuts out his heart. With his connection to E.V.A severed, she believes herself dying as well. She survives, however, and evolves into a humanoid form.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Force'' #27&lt;/ref&gt;

After Uncanny X-Force disbands, E.V.A. attempts to clone Fantomex back to life, but due to his three brains, an error occurs and three different bodies are grown for each personality: the evil brain becomes "Weapon XIII" (originally referred to as "Jean-Phillippe"), and wears a costume with inverted colors; the noble brain becomes "Cluster", a female version of Fantomex; and the mischievous one is restored to his proper body, taking the name of "Fantomex". He goes on to continue his relationship with Psylocke.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Force'' #35&lt;/ref&gt; Fantomex and Cluster later hijack a plane (leaving the pilot drugged and the flight attendants bound and gagged) in order to find Psylocke and [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], but Weapon XIII follows and kidnaps Fantomex. Cluster enlists the help of the new Uncanny X-Force (Puck, Psylocke, Spiral, and Storm) to find Fantomex.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Force (vol. 2) #3&lt;/ref&gt;

Pyslocke and Cluster travel to Madripor to hunt Weapon XIII. Weapon XIII uses his power of misdirection (which Fantomex and Cluster no longer possess) to confess his love to Psylocke. She agrees to stay with him only if he allows her to kill Fantomex, who betrayed her during a heist at the Louvre. During a heated battle she decides to free Fantomex and stun Weapon XIII, stating that she is done with all three of them.&lt;ref&gt;Uncanny X-Force Vol. 2 #8&lt;/ref&gt;

===X-Force===
Cable recruits Fantomex as part of his new [[X-Force#Volume 4|X-Force team]] with the promise that he'll help Fantomex find Cluster and Weapon XIII. He proves a questionable ally, as he constantly bickers with [[Psylocke]] and has a psychic sexual relations with Meme, who he really knows is actually Hope Summers (who Cable thinks is in a coma). He also kills new recruit [[List of Marvel Comics characters: F#ForgetMeNot|ForgetMeNot]] because "he was bored".&lt;ref&gt;X-Force Vol 4 # 10&lt;/ref&gt; The only concession that keeps Fantomex in line is that he gets to kill Cable every night,since Cable's body dies at the end of the day anyway and he has a clone ready to take his place the next day. Eventually Hope hacks into his mind and unwittingly transfers the super-mutant genetic code from mutant arms trafficker Volga. He then betrays the team, but is shot in the head by Domino.&lt;ref&gt;X-Force Vol 4 Issue #11&lt;/ref&gt; This is short-lived since E.V.A. is able to reboot his brain using the super-mutant code and now Fantomex has wings and god-like powers.&lt;ref&gt;X-Force Vol 4 Issue #12&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, he is tricked by Meme/Hope Summers into thinking he killed the team, but once he learns the ruse he vows vengeance. Fantomex is tricked again by Cable by agreeing to meet at various spy organization or organized crime locations for showdowns, but X-Force never shows; however, Fantomex still destroys the base, which ultimately helps X-Force's missions. Fantomex eventually finds X-Force, but is tricked by ForgetMeNot into teleporting near Hope Summers, who copies his super-powers.&lt;ref&gt;X-Force Vol 4 Issue #14&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of fighting him head-on, Hope implants a thought into his mind that one cannot be perfect, unless you have a well rounded personality, which includes inadequacies and insecurities. Fantomex cannot comprehend being perfect and imperfect, so he has a mental breakdown. Psylocke then uses her psychic blades to scramble his brain.&lt;ref&gt;X-Force Vol 4 Issue #15&lt;/ref&gt;

===Astonishing X-men===
As part of [[Astonishing X-men]] Fantomex is seemingly reunited with E.V.A after blaming Psylocke for taking E.V.A away from him in a previous encounter/storyline, He also now is working with Gambit until he pays what he owes to Fantomex. After a failed theft , Gambit was psychically called by Psylocke to help her, and Fantomex says he'll follow Gambit to the astral plane until he pays what he owes to him to the rest of psychically called X-men so that they know that their relationship is because of business reasons and not personal. After the team was split up in the astral plane, Fantomex ended up with Mystique and Mystique says they should enjoy themselves in the astral plane as they could conjure up anything before the Shadow King finds them and pain ensues, they have multiple activities together before sharing an intimate kiss and before they could go any further they were then teleported in front of an alive Professor X. It is revealed that Professor X's astral self has been trapped by the [[Shadow King]] and forced into a game with the X-Men as pawns, but Xavier is able to beat his old enemy by tricking him into bringing Rogue, Mystique, and Fantomex into the astral plane, as their malleable identities made them particularly powerful in this field of combat. At the conclusion of the confrontation, Fantomex sacrifices his body so that Xavier can return to Earth while he remains on the astral plane in the professor's place, Fantomex reasoning that nobody knows who he is outside of the role he was cast in by the Weapon X program, whereas this sacrifice will ensure that he is remembered for a great act by allowing Charles Xavier to return to life.

==Powers and abilities==
Fantomex can create extremely realistic illusions (he calls this ability "misdirection"). This ability is based on "reality skewing", rather than telepathy or holographic projection (Uncanny X-Force 14).

Fantomex has an external nervous system referred to as E.V.A. He has mentioned that E.V.A. emerged from his mouth during his time in the World and developed into a techno-organic flying saucer-like vessel. The relationship between E.V.A and Fantomex is symbiotic, so if E.V.A. experiences pain when she is not within Fantomex, he will feel it as well. When E.V.A. is separated from his body, Fantomex feels no pain and seems able to ignore most injuries. Along with this symbiotic relationship, Fantomex is linked to E.V.A. via telepathy. He can see through E.V.A.'s point of view and can take control of her movement. However, this requires concentration on the part of Fantomex. Moreover, E.V.A, as a bio-mechanical being, can reshape her body into a variety of forms, fly herself, and generate energy discharges to be used as weapons.  Fantomex contains three brains that used for parallel and independent thinking as well as nano-active blood; the nanites in his brain prohibit him from believing in anything greater than himself, such as gods or any supernatural beings. He also maintains an internal back-up nervous system which can be engaged if E.V.A. is damaged. However, this system is less complex than E.V.A. and does not allow Fantomex to see colors.

He possesses enhanced physical abilities. Fantomex is also capable of registering frequencies beyond the hearing range of normal humans. He even mentioned a healing factor on one occasion.&lt;ref&gt;''Fear Itself : Uncanny X-Force'' #2&lt;/ref&gt;

His three brains, allow him to survive severe head wounds since his secondary brains can take over should one be destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Force'' #18&lt;/ref&gt;

Fantomex can also enter a trance state and perform crucial tasks such as performing surgery on himself. In this state, he can also recover faster while placed in water. He can expertly read the body language of others in order to predict their attacks.  He is a very skilled hand-to-hand combatant and a master of stealth techniques. His title in his birthplace, the World, was "stealth-fighter."

Fantomex is a superb marksman. He used to use special bullets covered in sentient mutant skin that never missed their target (designed by Sir James Braddock, the father of Psylocke and Captain Britain) but he used his last of these against Archangel. He carries a variety of guns and other weapons.

His mask incorporates telepathy-blocking ceramics. These allow his mind to remain completely unreadable, even facing the most powerful telepaths of the Marvel Universe (Professor X and the Shadow King among others).

==Other versions==

===Days of Future Now===
In one variant of the ''[[Days of Future Past]]'' timeline (titled ''Days of Future Now'' and depicted in Frank Tieri's ''[[Weapon X]]'' series), Weapon X and the Sentinels are at war with Wolverine's X-Men and many other mutant groups, including Excelsior and Gene Nation. In this timeline, Fantomex becomes the host of Sublime and, possessed by the sentient bacteria, sabotages Wolverine's efforts to overthrow Weapon X.&lt;ref&gt;''Weapon X: Days of Future Now'' #1, 4–5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Here Comes Tomorrow===
In the ''[[Here Comes Tomorrow]]'' storyline, set in an alternate timeline 150 years in the future, the entire world is ruled by [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] (possessed by [[Sublime (Marvel Comics)|Sublime]]). E.V.A. is a member of this era's X-Men, which includes Wolverine, [[Tito Jerome Bohusk|Tito]] ([[Barnell Bohusk|Beak]]'s grandson), [[Sentinel (comic book)|Tom Skylark]] and his Sentinel known as Rover, [[Weapon XIV|Three-in-One]] (the Stepford Cuckoos), [[No-Girl]], and a reformed [[Cassandra Nova]] as their leader. E.V.A. has taken on a humanoid form and does not want to bond with anyone else's nervous system after "what happened to Fantomex." Whatever happened to Fantomex is never explicitly explained in the storyline, though it is strongly hinted that Beast's U-Man follower, Apollyon the Destroyer, is actually Fantomex.&lt;ref&gt;''New X-Men'' #151–154 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

===X-Men: The End===
Fantomex is depicted briefly in ''X-Men: The End'' as part of X-23's dream induced by the Ladies Mastermind, as she is stated to be in love with him in this reality. In X-23's dream, they are shown together playing with a small daughter in their backyard.

'''The femicides in Honduras''' is a concept which designates the [[Murder|murders]] comitted against women within the [[Honduras]] territory in Central America, since 1990. According to the Penal Code in force until 2018, the crime of femicide is incurred, when a man or men kill a woman for reasons of gender, with hatred and contempt for her condition as a woman. Between 2002 and 2013 3,923 women were murdered.&lt;ref name="elmundo.es"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/internacional/2014/04/29/53600cb4268e3ec52a8b458b.html|title=Cerca de 4.000 mujeres fueron asesinadas en Honduras entre 2002 y 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elnuevoherald.com/2013/11/06/1608639/mas-de-3600-mujeres-fueron-asesinadas.html |title=Más de 3,600 mujeres fueron asesinadas en Honduras entre 2002 y junio de 2013 - América Latina - ElNuevoHerald.com |date=10 September 2014 |publisher= |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910215834/http://www.elnuevoherald.com/2013/11/06/1608639/mas-de-3600-mujeres-fueron-asesinadas.html |archivedate=September 10, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of [[femicide]]s makes up 9.6% of the total number of homicides in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.unodc.org/documents/gsh/pdfs/2014_GLOBAL_HOMICIDE_BOOK_web.pdf|title = Global Study on Homicide|date = 2013|accessdate = |website = www.unodc.org|publisher = United National Office of Drugs and Crime (Vienna)|last = Gibbons|first = Jonathan}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, 53 women were killed every month and, as it occurs in the rest of murders, more than 90% of the cases were left in impunity. Before being killed, the women are commonly also burned, raped, and tortured. Between 2010 and 2013 the number of murders increased in 65%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laprensa.hn/honduras/555191-97/los-asesinatos-de-mujeres-aumentan-un-65-por-ciento-en-honduras|title=Los asesinatos de mujeres aumentan un 65 por ciento en Honduras|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laprensa.hn/csp/mediapool/sites/LaPrensa/Especiales/story.csp?cid=381912&amp;sid=770&amp;fid=273|title=Una interminable "epidemia" muerte de mujeres en Honduras|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The local national authorities have been accused of inaction by the population, given that in many cases it has not been cleared the responsibility of said felonies. There are a few government and non-government organizations that provide support to the mothers and relatives victims of [[femicide]]. In 2015, the Honduran government committed with 30 million [[Honduran lempira]]s for the creation of a special unit in the 2016 budget for femicide investigation.

== Femicides in 2017 ==
The violent deaths of women and femicides registered between January and December of 2017, added up a total of 389 cases. To disaggregate the data according to the age of the victims, 30.1% (117) was between 15 and 24 years old, women that are in the process of building their identity, educational training, and reproductive age. The records show that the greatest vulnerability occurred in the range of 20 to 24 years, accumulating 17.2% (67) of the total, while the age groups that showed the lowest number of victims were girls under 15 years of age with 32 cases and women aged 60 and over, with 21 victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://iudpas.unah.edu.hn/observatorio-de-la-violencia/boletines-del-observatorio-2/unidad-de-genero/|title=Muerte Violenta de Mujeres y Femicidios|last=|first=|date=|website=Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Honduras|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Femicides ==
As in most homicides comitted in Honduras, femicides continue to occur due to lack of investigation and judicial process.

== Contract Killing in Honduras ==
One of the most common methods of murdering women in Honduras is [[contract killing]], shooting the women either inside or outside of their residence and then escaping.

== National Civil Code Reforms ==
In February 2013 the [[National Congress of Honduras]] approved a reform in the national civil code which classified femicide as a serious felony, sanctioning with a sentence of up to 40 years in prison.&lt;ref name="elmundo.es" /&gt;

== Causes ==
Causes for the high level of femicides in Honduras are varied, although one of the principal causes is impunity, because 90% of murders are not investigated, so the killers continue to commit more femicides. 

== Unit for the Investigation of Femicides ==
In 2015, the [[Politics of Honduras|government of Honduras]] attributed 30 million [[Honduran lempira]]s to the creation of a special unit in the 2016 budget for the investigation of femicides.

is depicting Feodosia's arrest by the [[Nikonians (Orthodox Christianity)|Nikonians]] in 1671. As an [[Old Believer]] she holds two fingers, rather than three, raised in the old way of making the [[Sign of the cross]].]]

'''Feodosia Prokopiyevna Morozova''' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Феодо́сия Проко́пьевна Моро́зова}}) (21 May 1632 – 1 December 1675) was one of the best-known partisans of the [[Old Believer]] movement. She was perceived as a martyr after she was arrested and died in prison.

==Life==
She was born on May 21, 1632 into a family of the [[okolnichy]] Prokopy Feodorovich Sokovnin. At the age of 17, she was married to the [[boyar]] Gleb Morozov, brother to the tsar's tutor [[Boris Morozov]], one of the wealthiest men in Russia and  brother-in-law  of  Tsar Alexis. Feodosia bore one child to Gleb, a son, Ivan. After her husband's early death in 1662, she retained a prominent position at the Russian court as a lady-in-waiting to [[Maria Miloslavskaya|Tsarina Maria]]. She also inherited vast wealth, which she administered on behalf of her son Ivan.

During the [[Raskol]], because Archpriest [[Avvakum]] was her [[confessor]], Feodosia joined the [[Old Believers]]' movement and secretly took [[monastic vows]] with the name Theodora.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tretyakovgallery.ru/en/collection/_show/image/_id/218 "Boyarina Morozova", The state Tetyakov Gallery]&lt;/ref&gt; She played an important role in convincing her sister, Princess Evdokia Urusova, to join the Old Believers. They were also joined by fellow noblewoman Maria Danilova.&lt;ref name = rev/&gt; Following Avvakum, she rejected the reforms of [[Patriarch Nikon]] insisting he had no authority in the church to alter established practices, identifying such innovations with the corruption of the faith by the [[antichrist]].&lt;ref name = madge&gt;Margaret Ziolkowski, ''Tale of Boiarynia Morozova: A Seventeenth-century Religious Life'', Lexington Books, 2000, pp.10-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

After many misfortunes the two sisters and Danilova were arrested by order of Tsar [[Alexis of Russia]] in 1671. They were interrogated and tortured over a long period, but refused to recant. Attempts to reach a compromise led by [[Patriarch Pitirim of Moscow|Patriarch Pitirim]] were also rejected. While she was under arrest, her son Ivan died.

[[Alexis of Russia|Alexis]] contemplated having Morozova burned at the stake, but was dissuaded. Instead she and the others were incarcerated in an underground cellar of the St. Paphnutius Monastery at [[Borovsk]], where they endured considerable deprivations. After the appointment of a new Patriarch, [[Patriarch Joachim of Moscow|Ioakim]], they were deprived of all support and were slowly starved. All three succumbed, probably to starvation, in 1675, with  Morozova dying on December 1.&lt;ref name = rev&gt;[http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=9785 Nadieszda Kizenko, Review of Margaret Ziolkowski, ed. Tale of Boiarynia Morozova: A Seventeenth-Century Religious Life. Lanham: Lexington Books, 2000. 144 pp.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reputation==
[[File:Borovsk chasovnya.jpg|thumb|A chapel constructed on the supposed site of Morozova's death]]
Avvakum wrote a  "Lament for the three martyrs". A hagiography, ''Tale of Boiarynia Morozov'', by an unknown author, gave an account of her life as a martyr. The story circulated widely and miracles were attributed to Morozova by Old Believers. Many Old Believer communities continue to venerate her as a martyr.&lt;ref name = madge/&gt;

Nevertheless, her reputation was limited until Morozova's role as a representative of Russian identity and tradition became important to nationalist writers in the 19th century. She became a household name after being discussed by important Russian writers and depicted by [[Vasily Surikov]].  She was also taken as a heroine by some radical groups, who saw her as a symbol of resistance to state power. The [[People's Will]] revolutionary movement promoted her, and her virtues were praised by writers of the Soviet era such as [[Anna Akhmatova]], [[Varlam Shalamov]] and [[Fazil Iskander]], who "symbolically enlisted her in their own causes of resistance".&lt;ref name = rev/&gt;

A chapel was constructed in 2002 on the site of the prison where Morozova died.

__NOTOC__
'''Hannibal Mago''' ({{lang-xpu|𐤇‬𐤍𐤁‬𐤏‬𐤋‬‬}}, {{sc|ḥnbʿl}}){{sfnp|Huss|1985|p=[https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=NvEK7kc3qnQC&amp;pg=PA565 565]}} was a grandson of [[Hamilcar I of Carthage|Hamilcar Mago]]. He predates the more famous Carthaginian general [[Hannibal]] by about 200 years.

==Career==
He was [[shofet]] (judge) of [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]] in 410 BC and in 409 BC commanded a Carthaginian army sent to [[Sicily]] in response to a request from the city of [[Segesta]]. In the [[Battle of Selinus]] he successfully took the Greek city of Selinus and then [[Himera]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Xenophon]], ''Hellenica'' I.1.37&lt;/ref&gt; In the process of this conquest he was said to have killed some 3,000 prisoners of war, reportedly as revenge for the defeat his grandfather suffered in the [[Battle of Himera (480 BC)|Battle of Himera]] 70 years before.

==Death==
In 406 BC Hannibal Mago died in a plague that broke out during the siege of [[Agrigento]].

This person should not be confused with the much more famous Carthaginian general [[Hannibal Barca]] who led the Carthaginian forces during the [[Second Punic War]] about two centuries later.

[[Image:holy rood.jpg|thumb|right|View of Washington Monument from Holy Rood Cemetery]]
[[Image:Holy Rood graves.jpg|thumb|Much of Holy Rood Cemetery has fallen into disrepair.]]
'''Holy Rood Cemetery''' is located at 2126 [[Wisconsin Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Wisconsin Avenue]] NW at the southern end of the [[Glover Park]] neighborhood of [[Washington, D.C.]]  It stands at one of the highest elevations in Washington, D.C. and has memorable views.  Holy Rood Cemetery contains approximately 7,000 graves, including as many as 1,000 free and enslaved [[African Americans]], and may be the best-documented slave burial ground in the District of Columbia. At the western edge of the cemetery is the grave of Joseph Nevitt, a veteran of the American Revolution.&lt;ref name="Catholic"/&gt;

Originally named Trinity Church Upper Grave Yard, the cemetery was established by [[Holy Trinity Church of Georgetown|Holy Trinity Catholic Church]] in 1832, and enlarged between 1850 and 1870.&lt;ref name="Catholic"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://gloverparkhistory.com/cemeteries/holy-rood-cemetery/holy-rood-cemetery/|title=Burial Grounds of Holy Trinity Church, Georgetown, D.C.|journal=Newsletter of the Catholic Historical Society of Washington|date=July–September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The cemetery walls were torn down in 1901 and new ones erected, and a large number of trees cut down to prevent roots from dislocating memorials and limbs from damaging monuments during storms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Improvements Being Made in Holy Rood Cemetery|newspaper=Washington Evening Star|date=November 20, 1901|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cemetery was active from the mid-nineteenth century into the early twentieth century, and a few burials took place as late as the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Catholic" /&gt;

The cemetery is owned by [[Georgetown University]].  In the 1980s, the university explored the possibility of disinterring the bodies buried there so that the land could be put to other uses, but was blocked by a legal action brought by the remaining holders of burial rights.&lt;ref name="Catholic"/&gt;  The cemetery reflects years of disuse and neglect. Many of the tombstones are toppled, damaged or overgrown, and grass grows up through large cracks in the asphalt walkway leading through it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Salmon|first=Jacqueline L.|title='It Shows a Disrespect for the Dead': Condition of Holy Rood Cemetery Upsets Family Members of Deceased|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=August 28, 2008|page=T23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Mortimer Brinkley''' (born 1763 or 1766{{spaced ndash}}died 14 September 1835) was the first [[Royal Astronomer of Ireland]] and later [[Bishop of Cloyne]]. He was President of the [[Royal Irish Academy]] (1822–35), President of the [[Royal Astronomical Society]] (1831–33). He was awarded the [[Cunningham Medal]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://irelandroots.com/ Ireland Roots] Cunningham is also written as Conyngham&lt;/ref&gt; in 1818, and the [[Copley Medal]] in 1824.&lt;ref name=acad&gt;{{acad|id=BRNY783J|name=Brinkley, John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Brinkley was born in [[Woodbridge, Suffolk]] and was baptised there on 31 January 1763, the illegitimate son of Sarah Brinkley, a butcher's daughter.

On being admitted to [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], he was recorded as being the son of John Toler Brinkley, a vintner, but it is strongly suggested that his real father was [[John Toler, 1st Earl of Norbury]], Chief Justice of the Irish Court of Common Pleas.&lt;ref&gt;Venn, John, [https://archive.org/details/biographicalhist02venn ''Biographical History of Gonville and Caius College] 1349-1897'', vol. ii, pp. 107-8. Cambridge University Press, 1898.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=acad/&gt;

His exact date of birth is unknown; he has often been assigned the birth year 1763, as at least one obituary gives his age at death in 1835 as 72.&lt;ref&gt;''Gentleman's Magazine''. November 1835, p. 547.&lt;/ref&gt; However, his memorial at [[Trinity College, Dublin]] states that he died aged 70; also, he was recorded as being 17 upon [[matriculation]] at [[Gonville and Caius College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] in August 1783, both of which imply a slightly later birth year.

==Career==
He graduated [[Bachelor of Arts]] (BA) in 1788 as senior [[Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|wrangler]] and [[Smith's Prize]]man, was elected a fellow of the college and was awarded [[Master of Arts (Oxford, Cambridge and Dublin)|Cambridge Master of Arts]] (MA Cantab) in 1791. He was [[Ordination|ordained]] at [[Lincoln Cathedral]] in the same year.

In 1792 he became the second [[Andrews Professor of Astronomy|Andrews Professor]] of [[Astronomy]] in the [[University of Dublin]], which carried the new title of Royal Astronomer of Ireland. Together with [[John Law (bishop)|John Law]], [[Bishop of Elphin]], he drafted the chapter on "Astronomy" in [[William Paley]]'s ''Natural Theology.''&lt;ref&gt;W Paley, ''Natural Theology'' (1802); footnote in the "Astronomy" chapter.&lt;/ref&gt; His main work concerned stellar astronomy and he published his ''Elements of Plane Astronomy'' in 1808.

In 1818 he was awarded the prestigious [[Cunningham Medal]] of the [[Royal Irish Academy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ria.ie/getmedia/3b7984d2-3580-4438-9d55-08ae8ded4e4e/Cunningham-Medal-2008---Seamus-Heaney.pdf.aspx Royal Irish Academy|title=Cunningham Medal|publisher=RIA|accessdate=11 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427021827/http://www.ria.ie/getmedia/3b7984d2-3580-4438-9d55-08ae8ded4e4e/Cunningham-Medal-2008---Seamus-Heaney.pdf.aspx|archivedate=27 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1822 was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=[[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]|accessdate=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the [[Copley Medal]] by the [[Royal Society]] in 1824.

Brinkley's observations that several stars shifted their apparent place in the sky in the course of a year were disproved at [[Greenwich]] by his contemporary [[John Pond]], the [[Astronomer Royal]]. In 1826, he was appointed Bishop of Cloyne in [[County Cork]], a position he held for the remaining nine years of his life. Brinkley was elected President of the [[Royal Astronomical Society]] in 1831, serving in that position for two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LIST OF PRESIDENTS AND DATES OF OFFICE|url=http://www.ras.org.uk/about-the-ras/a-brief-history/766-past-ras-presidents|work=A brief history of the RAS|publisher=[[Royal Astronomical Society]]|accessdate=10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brinkley died in 1835 at Leeson Street, [[Dublin]] and was buried in Trinity College chapel. He had become a [[Doctor of Divinity]] (DD) and an honorary [[Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh]] (HFRSE). He was succeeded at [[Dunsink Observatory]] by [[William Rowan Hamilton]].

==Family==
Brinkley married Esther, daughter of Matthew Weld of Molesworth Street, [[Sheriff of Dublin City]], by his wife Elizabeth Kane, daughter of Nathaniel Kane (d. 1757) of Drumreaske, Co. Monaghan; Sheriff (1720) and [[List of Lord Mayors of Dublin|Lord Mayor of Dublin]] (1734); co-founder of the Bank of Kane &amp; Latouche. Brinkley and his wife were the parents of two sons and a daughter: John (1793–1847), Rector of Glanworth, Diocese of Cloyne, who married Anna, second daughter and co-heir of Walter Stephens, of Hybla, co. Kildare; Sarah Jane (1801-1827), second wife of [[Robert James Graves|Dr. Robert Graves]], who died giving birth to a daughter; and Matthew (1797–1855) J.P., of Parsonstown House, Co. Meath, who married Harriet, a daughter of [[Richard Graves (theologian)|Richard Graves]] and with her was the father of [[Francis Brinkley]].&lt;ref&gt;''Burke's Landed Gentry of Ireland'', 1912.

[[Beatification|Blessed]] '''Giovanni Giovenale Ancina''' (19 October 1545 – 30 August 1604) was an [[Italian people|Italian]] [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] prelate who served as the [[Bishop of Saluzzo]] and was a professed member from the [[Oratory of St. Philip Neri|Oratorians]].&lt;ref name=SQPN&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://catholicsaints.info/blessed-giovanni-giovenale-ancina/|title=Blessed Giovanni Giovenale Ancina|date=22 April 2016|publisher=Saints SQPN|accessdate=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AV&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://archive.org/stream/LifeOfBJohnJuvenalAncina#page/n17/mode/2up|title=The Life of B. John Juvenal Ancina: companion of St. Philip Neri, bishop of Saluzzo|publisher=Archive|date=|accessdate=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bishop was also a scholar and music composer and was also known for being a noted orator. He served in the Oratorians as a simple priest for around two decades prior to his episcopal appointment which he attempted to elude for five months before submitting to [[Pope Clement VIII]] and accepting the papal appointment. He entered his diocese several months later where he became noted for his charitable work with the poor and his efforts to better implement the reforms of the [[Council of Trent]].&lt;ref name=BO&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.birminghamoratory.org.uk/oratorian-saints/blessed-juvenal-ancina/|title=Blessed Juvenal Ancina (1545-1604)|publisher=Birmingham Oratory|date=|accessdate=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NB&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.nboratory.org/html/ancina.html|title=Blessed Giovanni Giovenale Ancina, C.O.|date=|publisher=The New Brunswick Oratory of St. Philip Neri|accessdate=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His cause for sainthood commenced soon after his death though complications arose due to a lack of concrete evidence suggesting that he was killed in hatred of the faith due to his being poisoned so that framework for the cause was abandoned well into the cause's advanced stages.&lt;ref name=SEB&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.santiebeati.it/dettaglio/34350|title=Blessed Giovanni Giovenale Ancina|date=|publisher=Santi e Beati|accessdate=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His beatification was celebrated under [[Pope Leo XIII]] in 1890 in [[Saint Peter's Basilica]].

==Life==
Giovanni Giovenale Ancina was born at dawn on 19 October 1545 in [[Fossano]] as the first of four children to the successful businessman Durando Ancina (of Spanish roots) and Lucia degli Araudini; he was in fear of death so his parents turned to [[Saint Juvenal of Narni|Saint Juvenal]] to restore his health which happened so the saint's name became his middle name.&lt;ref name=AV/&gt;&lt;ref name=BO/&gt; His brother was the Oratorian priest Giovanni Matteo Ancina who followed him after birth and then two sisters.&lt;ref name=NB/&gt;

The two brothers made a little chapel in their home and spent their spare time singing [[psalms]] and litanies before images of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Madonna]] and the saints since both were pious children.&lt;ref name=AV/&gt; He studied at [[Montpellier]] in [[France]] (his father sent him there in 1559 though excellent results saw his admittance to a prestigious Turin institute) and then studied at [[Padua]] and [[Mondovì]] as well as in [[Turin]]; he graduated with degrees in both medicine and philosophical studies; he travelled to Montpellier alongside a friend Lazarus Marengo.&lt;ref name=BO/&gt; In Mondovì he studied subjects such as mathematics and rhetoric and published the "Academia Subalpina" while there; he had not finished his course there when news reached him his father would soon die so he rushed to aid him in his final hours. After his father died he attended a [[University of Padua|Padua college]] where he wrote the [[Latin]] poem "The Naval Battle of the Christian Princes" in 1566 and dedicated this to the [[Doge of Venice]] [[Girolamo Priuli (1486–1567)|Girolamo Priuli]].&lt;ref name=AV/&gt; The death of [[Pope Pius V]] in mid-1572 saw him recite an [[ode]] in public in the late pontiff's honor while making the accurate prediction that the next pope would title himself as "Gregory". His mother died while he was in Turin in 1569 and in 1572 the [[Order of Saint Augustine]] invited him to attend their provincial chapter at [[Savigliano]].

He became an accomplished musician and man of letters. His talents and interests coupled with his various connections led him to a wide range of career options which included a stint as a professor of medicine at the [[University of Turin|Turin college]].&lt;ref name=SQPN/&gt;&lt;ref name=AV/&gt; He first became a doctor and then in 1574 accompanied Count Federigo Madrucci to [[Rome]] as the count's personal doctor. It was there in Rome that Ancina attended the theological lectures that Cardinal [[Saint Robert Bellarmine]] gave and the two became quick friends. Ancina had known he would not soon return to Turin so sent part of his works to the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin]] at Fossano and asked the remainder be given to a bookseller to sell on his behalf. But Ancina learnt the bookseller sold the books but used the profits for himself but wrote him a letter forgiving him while sending another to his relations asking that the bookseller be forgiven.

He also began to participate in the activities of the [[Oratory of St. Philip Neri|Oratorians of Saint Philip Neri]] and met [[Saint Philip Neri]] himself around 1575.&lt;ref name=SQPN/&gt; In the order he had been honored in sweeping the church or cleaning the candlesticks for he believed the menial jobs were better suited for him despite his learned prowess.&lt;ref name=AV/&gt; He was content with three to four hours' worth of sleep and often slept on the bare floor; he wore a [[hair shirt]] and girdle and wore a coarse linen shirt over his cassock while choosing coarse food.

But Neri himself dissuaded Ancina from joining a religious order in favor of the Oratorians and so he entered that order on 1 October 1578 while he was made a deacon in 1579; Ancina himself made his solemn profession later on 7 October 1580. He was later [[ordained]] to the [[priesthood]] on 9 June 1582.&lt;ref name=NB/&gt; He had been a deacon for an extended period until Neri bade him accept the priesthood. In 1586 he was sent to [[Naples]] to help in the establishment of a house for the Oratorians. He proved to be effective in reaching the population both through his preaching and his musical talents. It was there in Naples that Ancina published the "Tempio Armonico della Beatissima Vergine" which was a collection of spiritual songs set to a range of voices. Through his development of cultural activities he drew the participation of the aristocrats of the town. He also wrote the "Oratorio dei Principi" as a guide to the moral issues the people faced at the time. His fame increased over time and his lifelong friend Cardinal [[Cesare Baronio]] dubbed him "a new [[Saint Basil]]".&lt;ref name=NB/&gt;&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt; He met Francesco Maria Tarugi - a fellow Oratorian - who was later named as a cardinal. His niece Lucilla Forti was a penniless orphan that he and his brother sent for to come to Rome and the brothers put her under the care of a matron and supported her education at the [[Order of Preachers|Dominican]] [[convent]] of [[Santa Maria Maddalena]] on Monte Cavallo. Forti was at first denied admittance into the order when she realized she wanted to become a [[nun]] herself but was soon granted permission. Just before her official reception she happened to meet the papal carriage where [[Pope Gregory XIV]] stopped and called her to him. The pope blessed her and expressed his delight at the fact that Ancina was her maternal uncle.&lt;ref name=AV/&gt;

Around 1596 he became concerned when the episcopal sees of [[Nice, France|Nice]] and [[Vercelli]] became vacant for he heard a whisper that the [[Duke of Savoy]] wanted to nominate him to the pope for one of the positions.&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt; He was called to Rome in the autumn of 1596 where [[Pope Clement VIII]]'s nephew [[Pietro Aldobrandini]] told him that the pope wanted to raise Ancina into the episcopate.&lt;ref name=SQPN/&gt;&lt;ref name=BO/&gt; The pope himself had referred to Ancina as the best prepared candidate for an episcopal role he had ever heard of. Ancina was reluctant to accept this nomination but in an ironic twist further enhanced his reputation through his notable preaching in the various places (in [[Loreto, Marche|Loreto]] and [[Cingoli]] as well as [[Fermo]] amongst others) which he visited over the period of five months while perpetrating this evasion. In 1598 while hiding in [[San Severino Marche|San Severino]] he composed "The Wandering Pilgrim" which made the accurate prediction that the pope would die in 1605.&lt;ref name=NB/&gt; But his hiding place was soon discovered and he was summoned to Rome where the pope asked him to preach before him despite the priest's surprise. The pope wanted him to become the [[Bishop of Mondovì]] but he begged that it be the [[Bishop of Saluzzo|see of Saluzzo]] so he could preach to heretics and convert their hearts; on 26 August 1602 the cardinal-nephew prevailed this plea on the pope and he was named as the Bishop of Saluzzo.&lt;ref name=SQPN/&gt; Cardinal Alessandro de' Medici - the future [[Pope Leo XI]] - was delighted of his appointment and had hailed Ancina for his learnedness and his succinct responses to theological questions that were posed to him.

He received his [[episcopal consecration]] as a bishop on 1 September 1602 in the church of [[Santa Maria in Vallicella]] from Camillo Borghese  - future [[Pope Paul V]]. Cardinal Francesco Maria Tarugi and Cardinal Cesare Baronio were also in attendance.&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt; Ancina left Rome on 2 October 1602 and arrived in Turin on 19 October before heading to Fossano where he left on 5 March 1603 to his new diocese. He took possession of his new episcopal see on 6 March 1603. He once sought leave from Clement VIII to renounce his see and go to [[Geneva]] to preach but the pope refused this plea.

Ancina made a major goal of his episcopate the implementation of the directives of the recent [[Council of Trent]]. In line with this he convened [[Synod|a gathering of the episcopate]] where he laid out the methods of reform for both those in the priesthood and for the faithful. He made arrangements to set up a [[Seminary|religious educational institute]] to provide a higher level of knowledge and dedication in new priests. He gave a large emphasis to the instruction of the faithful in the teachings and beliefs of the faith for which he introduced the use of the new [[catechism]] that the Council of Trent had drawn up. He encouraged the adoration of the [[Blessed Sacrament]].

The Bishop [[Saint Francis de Sales]] had a great admiration for Ancina who was later to establish and join an Oratorian house in his own diocese. The two often corresponded with each other and Ancina received a letter from his friend on 17 May 1599 who sent it from Turin at the time. On 3 May 1603 the Bishop de Sales had invited him to attend a sermon that he was to give.&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt;

The bishop died on 30 August 1604. It was his zeal which led to his death — a renegade monk poisoned him after the bishop disciplined him for visiting a convent with a sinful intent.&lt;ref name=SQPN/&gt; Ancina knew quite well who his poisoner was but refused to provide a statement against him. On 20 August the monk gave him wine laced with poison under the guise of reconciliation; the bishop was surprised at the gesture but drank the contents. The monk then fled to [[Genoa]] under the false pretense of going to [[Savona]] for a pilgrimage. The bishop began vomiting and was confined to his bed as his condition worsened and when suffering overcame him he murmured to himself: "Oh! What poison! What terrible poison this is!"&lt;ref name=NB/&gt; The Duke of Savoy heard of this and sent his private doctor to help Ancina though nothing could be done at that stage. He summoned his brother to him and then asked for his confession to be heard before receiving the [[Extreme Unction]]. The ailing bishop asked to be laid on the bare floor to die and he invoked [[Saint Gennaro]] - whom he fostered a devotion to. His final words were: "[[Jesus Christ|Jesus]], sweet Jesus, with Mary give peace to my soul". He was buried in the diocesan cathedral. In 1620 his remains were exhumed and found well-preserved but turned into dust upon contact with the air lest for the skull and several bones.&lt;ref name=AV/&gt;

==Beatification==
The beatification process opened in an informative process in 1619 in Saluzzo and Fossano as well as in Genoa and [[Acqui]]. The formal introduction to the cause came on 2 December 1621 under [[Pope Gregory XV]] and he became titled as a [[Servant of God]] as a result. [[Pope Urban VIII]] confirmed the cause's opening in 1624 and an apostolic process opened in Rome and Saluzzo as well as Turin and Naples.&lt;ref name=AV/&gt; The cause was then suspended for a time until 1666 when [[Pope Alexander VII]] reopened it. Saint Francis de Sales attested to Ancina's saintliness sometime in the 1660s and the [[Congregation for Rites]] later validated the informative and apostolic processes in 1716.

The confirmation of Ancina's life of [[heroic virtue]] allowed for [[Pope Pius IX]] to title him as [[Venerable]] on 29 January 1870. [[Pope Leo XIII]] later approved two miracles attributed to Ancina's intercession on 30 May 1889 and beatified the late bishop in [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] on 9 February 1890.

[[File:Last Rites ca 1600.jpg|thumb|Administering the last rites ([[Dutch School (painting)|Dutch School]], c. 1600)]]

The '''last rites''', in [[Roman Catholicism]], are the last prayers and ministrations given to an individual of the faith, when possible, shortly [[near-death (disambiguation)|before death]]. The last rites go by various names. They may be administered to those [[Death row|awaiting execution]], mortally injured, or [[terminal illness|terminally ill]].

==Roman Catholic Church==
{{see also|Viaticum|Anointing of the Sick in the Catholic Church}}

[[File:Joseph T. O'Callahan gives last rites to an injured crewman aboard USS Franklin (CV-13), 19 March 1945.jpg|thumb|left|A Roman Catholic [[chaplain]], Lieutenant Commander [[Joseph T. O'Callahan]], administering the last rites to an injured crewman aboard [[USS Franklin (CV-13)|USS ''Franklin'']], after the ship was set afire by a Japanese air attack, 19 March 1945]]

What in the judgment of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] are properly described as the Last Rites are [[Viaticum]] (Holy Communion administered to someone who is dying), and the ritual prayers of Commendation of the Dying, and Prayers for the Dead.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.osv.com/OSVNewsweekly/Story/TabId/2672/ArtMID/13567/ArticleID/768/Anointing-or-last-rites.aspx M. Francis Mannion, "Anointing or last rites?" in ''Our Sunday Visitor'' Newsweekly]&lt;/ref&gt;

Of these, only Viaticum is a [[sacrament]].

The sacrament of [[Anointing of the Sick]] has often been postponed until someone is near death, so much so that, in spite of the fact that in all celebrations of this sacrament, the liturgy prays for recovery of the health of the sick person if that would be conducive to his salvation, Anointing of the Sick has been thought to be exclusively for the dying and has been called Extreme Unction (Final Anointing).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p2s2c2a5.htm ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', 1512]&lt;/ref&gt; If administered to someone who is not just ill but near death, Anointing of the Sick is generally accompanied by celebration of the sacraments of [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|Penance]] and Viaticum. In such cases, the normal order of administration is: first Penance, then Anointing, then Viaticum.

Although these three sacraments are not, in the proper sense, the Last Rites, they are sometimes mistakenly spoken of as such.

The Eucharist given as Viaticum is the only sacrament essentially associated with dying: "The celebration of the Eucharist as Viaticum is the sacrament proper to the dying Christian".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dioceseofgallup.org/pdfs/sacramental_guidelines/ANNOINTING.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=Diocese of Gallup |title=Sacramental Guidelines}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Roman Ritual's ''Pastoral Care of the Sick: Rites of Anointing and Viaticum'', Viaticum is the only sacrament dealt with in ''Part II: Pastoral Care of the Dying''. Within that part, the chapter on Viaticum is followed by two more chapters, one on ''Commendation of the Dying'', with short texts, mainly from the Bible, a special form of the litany of the saints, and other prayers, and the other on ''Prayers for the Dead''. A final chapter provides ''Rites for Exceptional Circumstances'', namely, the ''Continuous Rite of Penance, Anointing, and Viaticum'', ''Rite for Emergencies'', and ''Christian Initiation for the Dying''. The last of these concerns the administration of the sacraments of Baptism and Confirmation to those who have not received them.

In addition, the priest has authority to bestow a [[Apostolic Blessing|blessing in the name of the Pope]] on the dying person, to which a plenary [[indulgence]] is attached.

People awaiting execution would receive Confession and Viaticum,  but not Anointing of the Sick, since their impending death is not on account of an illness.

==Eastern Orthodox Church and Byzantine-Rite Catholic Churches==
[[File:Prithastie ranennogo.jpg|thumb|[[Russian Orthodox]] priest administering the last rites to a soldier on the field of battle]]

In the [[Orthodox Church]] and those [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] which follow the [[Byzantine Rite]], the last rites consist of the [[Sacred Mysteries]] (sacraments) of [[Confession (religion)|Confession]] and the reception of [[Eucharist#Eastern Christianity|Holy Communion]].

Following these sacraments, when a person dies, there are a series of prayers known as ''The Office at the Parting of the Soul From the Body''. This consists of a [[blessing]] by the priest, the [[usual beginning]], and after the [[Lord's Prayer]], [[Psalm 51|Psalm 50]]. Then a [[canon (hymnography)|Canon]] to the [[Theotokos]] is chanted, entitled, "On behalf of a man whose soul is departing, and who cannot speak". This is an elongated poem speaking in the person of the one who is dying, asking for forgiveness of sin, the mercy of God, and the [[intercession]] of the [[saint]]s. The rite is concluded by three prayers said by the priest, the last one being said "at the departure of the soul."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Hapgood |first=Isabel Florence |authorlink=Isabel Hapgood |title=Service Book of the Holy Orthodox-Catholic Apostolic Church |place=Englewood, NJ |publisher=[[Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese]] |year=1975 |edition=Revised |pages=360–366}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an alternative rite known as ''The Office at the Parting of the Soul from the Body When a Man has Suffered for a Long Time''. The outline of this rite is the same as above, except that Psalm 70 and Psalm 143 precede Psalm 50, and the words of the canon and the prayers are different.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=A Monk of St. Tikhon's Monastery |year=1995 |title=Book of Needs (Abridged) |place=South Canaan PA |publisher=[[St. Tikhon's Seminary]] Press |edition=2nd |pages=123–136 |isbn=1-878997-15-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[rubric]] in the [[Book of Needs]] (priest's service book) states, "With respect to the Services said at the parting of the soul, we note that if time does not permit to read the whole Canon, then customarily just one of the prayers, found at the end of the Canon, is read by the Priest at the moment of the parting of the soul from the body."&lt;ref&gt;A Monk of St. Tikhon's Monastery, ''Op. cit.'', p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

As soon as the person has died the priest begins ''The Office After the Departure of the Soul From the Body'' (also known as ''The First [[Pannikhida]]'').&lt;ref&gt;A Monk of St. Tikhon's Monastery, ''Op. cit.'', pp. 137–154.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Orthodox Church [[Holy Unction]] is not considered to be solely a part of a person's preparation for death, but is administered to any Orthodox Christian who is ill, physically or spiritually, to ask for God's mercy and forgiveness of sin.&lt;ref name="Hapgood"&gt;Hapgood, ''Op. cit.'', pp. 607–608.&lt;/ref&gt; There is an abbreviated form of Holy Unction to be performed for a person in imminent danger of death,&lt;ref name="Hapgood" /&gt; which does not replace the full rite in other cases.

Lorraine comprises the "départements" of [[Meurthe-et-Moselle]], [[Meuse (department)|Meuse]],  [[Moselle (department)|Moselle]] and [[Vosges (department)|Vosges]] and the principal cities are  Nancy,  [[Bar-le-Duc]], [[Metz]] and [[Épinal]].

[[File:Battle of Frontiers - Map.jpg|thumb|Map showing the Battles of Frontiers]]

==The Battle of Lorraine==
Historians have called the period in Lorraine from 14 August to 13 September 1914 the "Battle of Lorraine" and this covers a sequence of battles including the Battle of Morhange, the Battle of the Trouée de Charmes, the Battle of Rozelieures, the Battle of the Mortagne, and the Battle of the Grand Couronné. These all involved the 2nd French Army.
South-east of Nancy the French Ist Army under General Dubail had many encounters with the Germans and apart from the fighting at Sarrebourg they fought the Battle of the Haute-Meurthe from 24 August to 11 September 1914.  This will be dealt with in the article covering Alsace. After these battles a defined front line was established by late September and was not to change significantly until the end of the war, although fighting from trench to trench would occur almost daily.

The short period of August to September 1914,  saw the French Plan XVII shattered and this, and the ultimate failure of the Von Schlieffen plan, saw the "war of movement" end and a static war of trenches and more trenches take over.

For France the death toll was notable and by the end of August, the French Army had suffered 75,000 dead of which 27,000 were killed on 22 August alone,&lt;ref name="Stevenson-p54"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stevenson|first=David|title=1914-1918: The History of the First World War|year=2004|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0-14-026817-1|pages=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; the death toll was similar to [[first day on the Somme]]. Total French [[casualty (person)|casualties]] for the first month of the war were 260,000&lt;ref name="Stevenson-p54" /&gt; of which 140,000 were sustained during the climactic final four days of the battle of the Frontiers.

===The Battle of Morhange-Sarrebourg in Moselle===
This encounter is part of what is also known as the "Battle of Lorraine" and was fought from 14 August to 24 August 1914.

The French Army's "Plan XV11" set out the invasion of Lorraine and her return to France as a major objective. Annexed by Prussia after the 1870-1871 Franco Prussian War, along with Alsace, its return to France was essential. The French were therefore to give top priority to retaking Lorraine and Alsace while the Germans had other ideas and were intent on pursuing the Von Schlieffen plan to the north.  The beginning of the war in August 1914 saw the two protagonists lock horns in the north at Charleroi, in the centre at the Ardennes and in Lorraine at Morhange and Sarrebourg, while in Alsace the two sides fought at Mulhausen.  These early battles were identified by historians as the "Battles of the Frontiers" and the encounters at Morhange and Sarrebourg were two of them.

On 14 August 1914, the French attacked on two fronts, with General Auguste Dubail leading the French 1st Army with the objective being to take Sarrebourg to the east of Nancy,  while General Noel de Castelnau, leading the French 2nd Army, would attack Morhange.  The 1st and 2nd French Army were known as the "Army of Lorraine". Both Sarrebourg and Morhange were fortified towns.  Facing the French were the German 6th and 7th Armies. Prince Rupprecht had command of the 6th and overall command of both armies, with General Josias von Herringen having command of the 7th.

At this stage the German Army, knowing that their major effort was taking place with the march through Luxembourg and Belgium,  deliberately followed a policy of "retreat", feigning to be overwhelmed by the French, but luring them into a position where they would be vulnerable to a fierce counter-attack. "Come into my parlour said the spider to the fly."   However, as the French advanced Rupprecht soon tired of such tactics and pressed von Moltke to allow him to be more aggressive.  He wanted to drive forward and push the French back to Nancy. Rupprecht had his way, although this flew in the face of the blueprint of the von Schlieffen plan and on 20 August 1914, the Germans went on the offensive and the French 2nd Army were forced to retreat. Dubail and the French 1st Army could now no longer stay out on a limb attacking Sarrebourg and he also retreated,  but despite the retreat of the two French armies, Foch's XX Corps were able to successfully defend Nancy.

The French front-line was however now in disorder and Joffre, the French Commander in Chief, had no alternative but to order a general withdrawal and only eight days after the French offensive had begun both the 1st and 2nd Armies were back to the line Belfort-Epinal-Toul. The Germans had also pushed through the "Trouée des Charmes," a natural gap between Epinal and Toul, on 24 August,  but their success was limited to establishing a small salient. The French line held and fighting continued until the end of August.  Stalemate ensued. Given that they had not made any major gains, the Germans must have regretted tying up 26 Divisions in Lorraine and Alsace when these could have swung the outcome of the Battle of the Marne further to the north west. Morhange had then played an important role in the events of 1914.

General Dubail with his 1st Army and General de Castelnau with the 2nd Army, had however exhausted themselves in the fruitless attacks on Sarrebourg and Morhange and the French concept of "offensive a outrance" had withered before heavy German artillery, barbed wire and the now ubiquitous machine-gun.

Now the French withdrew to the line of the Grande Couronné. In effect the policy of "offensive a outrance" died in the killing fields of Lorraine and amongst the corpses of soldiers with their bright red pantaloons there were no doubt bodies of some of their officers still wearing white gloves.

Rupprecht's artillery continued to pound the French lines. Ste Genevieve, near Nomeny, was battered, and it was decided that the French Army must retreat behind the Grand Couronné. The French looked for some respite and on 22 August 1914 they found it when Rupprecht took the offensive against Charmes and exposed his flank to the troops now positioned beyond Nancy. The Germans attacked, the French counter-attacked, and the German 6th and 7th Armies locked horns with the French 1st and 2nd Armies, the French backed by the guns of Belfort, Epinal and Toul. Again stalemate ensued; there was no victor. There had however been a quite horrendous loss of life.

===Battle of the Mortagne River in Meurthe et Moselle===
After Morhange and Sarrebourg, Castelnau's 2nd Army retreated to the Grand Couronné and Mortagne and from 21 to 23 August they withdrew from Lunéville,which was occupied by the Germans on the 22nd, and sought to make contact with Dubail's 1st Army.

When the battle started on 24 August 225,000 French soldiers faced 300,000 Germans.  The Germans objective was to reach and pass the gap at Charmes which lay between the forts of Toul and Epinal to then attack Commercy, Bar-Le-Duc and Verdun from the rear.  Joffre's order was to defend Nancy and hold the position in front of Charmes so that Dubail could attack the German's flank at Mortagne and on the Meurthe.

On the 24th the Germans advanced from Mont-sur-Meurthe to Gerbéviller, passing the Mortagne and then attacked the fort at Manonviller which was taken on 27 August.

After taking Lamath the Germans attacked towards Romain and Bayon and the French attacked their flank at Courbesseaux, Saint-Boingt, Essey-la-Côte and Damas-aux-Bois while the 2nd Army's artillery blasted the Germans from the Flainval plateau.

On the 25th the Germans took Rozelieures, which was retaken in the afternoon of the same day. Castelnau pushed on and the 15th and 16th Army Corps retook Einvaux, Lamath, Blainville, and reached the Meurthe and the Martagne. At the same time the 8th Army Corps of the 1st French Army conquered Domptail and Saint-Pierremont. At Crevic and at Courbesseaux the struggle was bloody.

From the 26th to the 29th the German offensive was broken and the ground from Champenoux to Friscati was taken. Xermanénil was retaken and now the scene was set for the Battle of Grand-Couronné and the German attempt to take Nancy.  Castelnau emerged victorious on 13 September, Castelnau took Lunéville and the Germans retired to the Seille where they would dig in for four long years.  From 29 August to 7 September, Dubail's 1st French Army won the battles at Rambervillers and the Haute-Meurthe including fierce and bloody fighting on the Chipotte peak.

This part of the German line retreated to Parroy as far as the peak at Saales and dug down into their trenches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lpicr.rambervillers.info/menil/necro.php Battle of Mortagne] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205220220/http://lpicr.rambervillers.info/menil/necro.php |date=5 February 2016 }} Rambersviller website.

===The Battle of the "Trouée de Charmes" in Meurthe et Moselle===
[[File:Hussars11rozelieures02.jpg|thumb|centre|350px|A stone memorial celebrates the retaking of Rozelieures which it describes as the first French victory of the war]]
This encounter ran from 24 to 26 August 1914.

The war in Lorraine had started rather badly for the French, with her 2nd Army retreating from Morhange which left the 1st Army having to pull back from Sarrebourg.  Moltke, the German Chief of Staff, drew the conclusion that the 2nd Army was a spent force and had no further role to play and saw the opportunity to strengthen the attack to the rear of the French Armies which was the basis of the Von Schlieffen plan and what the German armies to the north were already trying to achieve. Moltke thought that if he could use Rupprecht wisely then the French could be hit twice from the rear, firstly by the German armies to the north and then by Rupprecht's 6th

Moltke planned that Rupprecht's 6th Army would pass through the Trouée de Charmes which passed between the Forts of Toul and Epinal and then turn to the northwest and march north to Bar-le-Duc and take the French 3rd and 4th Armies in the rear.

Now all depended on Castelnau whose 2nd Army now manned the Trouée de Charmes area and he learned from his Intelligence Service, that German columns were moving to Saffais and Bechamps and heading for the gap at the Trouée de Charmes. A few hours later French aerial observers would confirm this.  Now the French High Command directed General Dubail, commanding the 1st French Army to put his 8th Division at Castelnau's disposal. Dubail did this immediately and now Castelnau had much needed reinforcements and knew exactly what the Germans were up to.

On 24 August Rupprecht's troops began to attack in the direction of the "Trouée de Charmes" and he concentrated this attack on the centre of the 2nd Army as this was judged to be the cornerstone of the French's defence and where they were the strongest. Initially the Germans were successful and they managed to take Damelevières and Gerbeviller and then pushed the French from Vacquenatwood, Clairlieu and Censal from where they move towards Bayon.  At this point however, the French started to check the German advance, the French 74th Infantry in particular fighting with great tenacity and at the same time the Bavarians attacking the Flainval plateau were also checked by the French. Now in a desperate effort to force through the gap, the German 6th Army effectively weakened their right and left flanks which Castelnau saw and decided to use to his advantage. He attacked the German flanks with General Fayolle's 70th French Infantry and they were pushed out of Erbeviller, Réméréville and Courbesseaux. Now the right wing of the French 2nd Army attack Rupprecht's left flank and managed to take Saint-Boingt, Essey-la-Côte and Clézentaine Ménarmont.

During the night of 24 to 25 August Castelnau pounded the Germans with his artillery. Now Castelnau concentrated on Rupprecht's centre and launched an attack to take Rozelieures from the Germans. He was successful but the Germans hit back and retook Rozelieures but later in the day of the 25th the French took it back. Rozelieures was theirs!

On the 25th and 26th fighting was fierce in every area but finally Rupprecht ordered a retreat.

[[File:Monument de Lorraine 001.jpg|thumb|centre|300px|The Monument of Lorraine which celebrates the outcome of the engagements of August/September 1914]]

The battle of Charmes was a victory for the French 2nd Army and in stopping the Germans from passing through the "Trouée de Charmes" Castelnau had arguably saved the French from a complete disaster. To quote [[Maurice Barrès]]-{{Quotation|"Paris a été sauvé à la Marne, c'est parce que Castelnau avait vaincu à Rozelieures"}} {{Quotation|"If Paris was saved at the Marne it was because Castelnau won at Rozelieures"}}

The Trouée de Charmes was a gap in the French defensive lines north-east of the town of Charmes. There were many fortresses around Toul and Epinal in the Vosges. But around Lunéville, in the rather open landscape of plains and hills, there was only one fortress, the Fort de Manonviller. In this open country there are three natural obstacles, being the rivers Moselle, Vezouze and Meurthe. These last two rivers link together directly west of the city of Lunéville.
Any German Army which could break through the Gap of Charmes, would have been awarded with the advantage of three options to facilitate the continuation of its campaign on more accessible terrain: 1. Go right and attack Nancy and Toul, or 2. Go left, and attack St. Dié and Epinal, or 3. Advance directly to the Champagne.  Another reason why this weak link in the French defensive line was called the Gap, was the fact that the French 2nd Army linked up here with the 1st Army. During the period of 20–23 August the flanks of these armies almost lost contact.  During the Battle of the Trouée des Charmes from 24 until 26 August 1914, it took the French 2nd Army much effort to withstand the German attacks. It even needed the assistance of the 8e Corps d'Armée of Dubail's 1st Army.
Now the two sides regrouped and on 4 September clashed again in the "Battle of the Grand Couronné" which was to last until 13 September. After that encounter the front line in Lorraine would not change for the next four years.

===The Battle of the Grand Couronné in Meurthe et Moselle===
The fighting here was also part of the "Battles of the Frontiers" and took place from 4 to 13 September 1914, the 6th German Army under Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria being pitted against the 2nd French Army under General Castelnau.

The French retreat after the fighting at Morhange and Saarbourg saw them eventually take up position on the [[Grand Couronné]], an area of high ground to the east of Nancy, on an arc [[Pont-à-Mousson]], [[Champenoux]], [[Lunéville]] and Dombasie, Grand Couronné consists of a series of high ridges which dominates the plain to the east of Nancy. These ridges are La côte Sainte-Geneviève with a height of 394 metres, Le Mont Toulon with a height of 375 metres, Le Mont Saint-Jean with a height of 400 metres, the plateau of the Bois du Chapitre with a height of 400 metres, the plateau of the Bois de Faulx with the spur of La Rochette with a height of 406 metres and finally the plateau of Malzéville and the ridge called "Le Rembêtant".  These ridges dominated the plain and allowed excellent observation of it.

After the Battle at the Trouée de Charmes,  the German's first attempt to pierce the French line at the point where the 1st Army joined the 2nd Army,  the Germans decided to attack simultaneously [[Saint-Dié]] in the Battle of the Haute Meurthe and Nancy in the battle of the Grand Couronné.  The fighting at Haute Meurthe will be covered when we look at the war in the Alsace area.

The fighting at Charmes had been inconclusive and the capture of Nancy now became psychologically important for the Germans and the Kaiser came along to personally supervise the attacks and the French were not helped when Castelnau had to let men go to bolster the 3rd Army who were experiencing difficulties in the west.

The battle opened on 4 September when the German guns opened up destroying a number of villages in the area but from the 5th to the 11th, despite heavy losses, neither side were able to take the upper hand.  On 9 and 10 September the German guns opened fire on Nancy. By 12 September the Germans began to retreat and on the next day withdrew from Pont à Mousson and Lunéville which were then reoccupied by the French. The French then continued to the banks of the River Seille where the front line stabilised and did not change until 1918.

It could be argued that the Grand Couronné and the fighting at the Haute Meurthe encounter helped the allies in their success at the 1st Battle of the Marne in that they kept important numbers of German troops in Lorraine.  On 18 September 1914, Castelnau was made a "Grand-Officier de la [[légion d'honneur]]" and was to appear on postcards of the time under the title "The saviour of Nancy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sambre-marne-yser.be/article=5.php3?id_article=62 La Grande Cooronne] Retrieved 13 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
|This memorial is dedicated to the men of the 15th Army Corps, part of the 29th Division, and to 1,204 French soldiers who lost their lives in the fighting at Morhange.  The monument is located between Bidestroff and Vergaville. The men of the 15th mainly came from Provence and were the victims of a particularly heavy artillery bombardment, when caught on the high ground at Bidestroff, which left 1,204 dead on the battlefield.

It was in 1935 and on the initiative of the parish priest and the Bidestroff mayor, that a committee was set up which led to the monument being erected.  Most of the funds were collected from veterans in Toulon and the Strasbourg sculptor Valentin Jaeg was commissioned to carry out the sculptural work involved.  The monument is 12.5 metres high and at the top is the figure of the Archangel St Michael who raises his arms to heaven. St Michael is the patron saint of Bidestroff.

At the base there are groups of crosses on each of the monument's four faces, each inscribed with the name of one of the units of the 15th Army Corps. These surround the Cross of Christ. The inscriptions on the monument read {{Quotation|"Au XVè corps 19 et 20 août 1914"}} and {{Quotation|" Aux 1204 morts du cimetière militaire de Bidestroff, 1914-1925"}}

|-
|The most south easterly point of the Grande Couronné was at Léomont where the ground rises to 377 metres giving excellent views over the surrounding countryside and it was an important hill to hold to protect Nancy. Fierce fighting took place here in 1914 between the French 11th Division and German units from Bavaria. Indeed, on the night of 25 to 26 August 1914 the area changed hands 8 times. The 11th Infantry Division, comprised the 26th, 37th, 69th and 79th Infantry Regiments as well as gunners from the 8th and sappers from the 20th, and was known as the "Iron Division". The citation on the monument reads {{Quotation|""A la 11ieme division. La Lorraine et La France reconnaissantes Ici La division de Fer Arreta la ruée allemande"}}

Apart from their efforts at Léomont, the 11th had fought at Lunéville and Friscati and had played an important role in protecting Nancy. The original monument, erected in 1922, was destroyed by the Germans in 1940 and reconstructed in 1950. It depicts a soldier mounting guard and protecting Nancy. The original sculpture was the work of Gaston Broquet and when the monument was rebuilt the sculptor, J.Sinapi, faithfully copied Broquet's original work.

|[[Sainte-Geneviève, Meurthe-et-Moselle|Sainte-Geneviève]] is located in Meurthe et Moselle, south of Pont-a-Mousson and east of Nomeny and is in the area known as the Grand Couronné where most of the 2nd French Army found themselves after the Battle of the Trouée.  The latter had been the German's first attempt to break the French line after the encounters at Morhange and Sarrebourg, and they now decided to mount two major attacks on the French. One was aimed at Saint-Dié and resulted in the Battle of the Haute Meurthe and the second was aimed at taking Nancy and led to the Battle of Grand Couronné. One of the monuments dedicated to the memory of this battle is at Ste Geneviève and is known as the "Monument du Grand Couronné".  The monument stands on the heights of the Côte de Ste Geneviève and it was here that the French stationed their 59th Reserve Division. The monument is inscribed {{Quotation|"To the Defenders of the Grand Couronne August–September 1914 in memory of Louis Marin."}}

Marin was an influential local politician and the leader of the "National Republican Party" of Meurthe-et-Moselle, the President of the General Council of Nomeny and from 1934 to 1952 he was Chairman of the General Council of Meurthe-et-Moselle.  The monument is somewhat worn and at each end of a curved wall are depictions of Joan of Arc and St Genevieve.

|This handsome monument, as shown above, is located in the Bois-le-Prêtre near Montaumont not far from Pont-à-Mousson in the Meurthe-et-Moselle.  Between September 1914 and July 1915 there was fierce and bloody fighting here between the French 73rd and 128th Infantry Division (known as the " Wolves of Bois-le-Prêtre") and the German 121st Infantry Division. and a wooden cross was erected by the French soldiers and called the "Croix des Carmes".  This cross was subsequently moved to the French War cemetery at Pétant for protection.

In 1923, the soldiers who had fought at Bois-le-Prêtre raised funds to replace the original cross with this monument. The sculptural work is by Emile Just Bachelet.  His composition involves a large cross whose transverse is supported by two soldiers.  One wears the uniform worn by the French in 1914 and the other the standard uniform worn at the war's end.  The original cross has been bedded into the monument and the Bachelet's maquette is held in the Musée de l'École de Nancy.

Raymond Poincaré attended the inauguration which took place on 23 September 1923.  The stained glass artist Jacques Grüber depicted the inauguration in 1924 on a window in the church of Saint-Gorgon in Fey-en-Haye nearby.

Nancy had been occupied by the Germans in the 1870-71 war but in August 1914, General Castelnau's troops managed to stem the German offensive and saved Nancy at the Grand Couronné encounter.  Many French soldiers were wounded in this battle and were sent to the hospital at Nancy and those who did not survive are buried in this cemetery.

Underneath an elaborately carved granite canopy and supported by columns, is a sculpture of a reclining soldier which is reminiscent of the "Soldat du Droit" at Fleury-devant-Douaumont in the Meuse and around the canopy are inscribed  "les frontières"; the names of the main areas of the conflict- "Yser, Artois,  Marne,  Somme, Champagne, Aisne, Verdun, Argonne and Grand Couronné".

===The Battle of the Haute Meurthe===

After the defeats at the Battles of Lorraine and Sarrebourg, the 1st French Army retreated to the banks of the River Meurthe where they were involved in a series of encounters with the Germans in what is called the Battle of Haut-Meurthe which ran from 23 August to 10 September.  There was fighting in front of Rambervillers on the Chipotte mountain and Saint-Barbe, at Saint-Dié, Mandray, the Anozel mountain and at Taintrux and Nompatelize.

These encounters were all of a defensive nature but after 11 September they became of an offensive nature with the 13th, 21st and 14th Army Corps and the "Vosges Army Group" playing important roles and in this area between Nancy and the Hautes Vosges the front line was defined and changed little until the end of the war in 1918 but saw fierce exchanges between the two sides trench to trench.

===The War Memorial at Raon-l'Etape===
{| class="wikitable sortable"
|-
! scope="col" style="width:1000px;"|The War Memorial at Raon-l'Etape
|-
|The war memorial here features a bronze by Gaston Broquet entitled "La Patrouille".

The area around Raon-l'Etape saw much action in the period August/September 1914 and this particularly involved the 21st battalion of the "chasseurs à pied"

When the prospects of war loomed, the French started to garrison the area of the valley of the river Meurthe near to the Franco-German border.  Troops were moved to towns such as [[Baccarat]], [[Senones]], [[Saint-Dié]], and Raon-l'Étape, where the barracks were known as the "Dutertre" barracks and covered the route to [[Celles-sur-Plaine]] and [[Donon]]. The 21st arrived on 10 October 1913 and on 31 July 1914, the battalion took up positions around Celles-sur-Plaine and [[Allarmont]].  Once war broke out the battalion fought at [[Petit Donon]].  After the fighting at Morhange the 1st and 2nd French armies retreated towards the Meurthe.  The 13th French Infantry division fought at [[Badonviller]], Raon, La Neuveville-lès-Raon, La Haute-Neuveville and La Chipotte then at the end of 21 August left the Vosges to fight in the Battle of the Marne and were then involved in the [[Race for the Sea]] fighting at various points as the front line snaked northwards. During the war almost 2,300 chasseur (riflemen) were killed including men from Raon-l'Étape and La Neuveville.

On 24 August, the 21st Army Corps passed along the left bank of the Meurthe and the 20th and 21st battalions of the "Chasseur a pied" fought in the town of Raon-l'Étape itself until they retreated to Haute-Neuveville. and the Chipotte mountain, fighting as they went. The Battles of the Meurthe followed including the fighting at Grand Couronné, the Trouée de Charmes, at the Chipotte and in the la Haute Meurthe.  all of which ran through until early September. Finally the Germans were halted along the line of the Meurthe. During all this fighting [[Raon-l'Étape]] was occupied by the Germans for 19 days. Now the front line was stabilised parallel with the right bank of the Meurthe and running from [[La Chapelotte]] to La Fontenelle and this front line was not to change until the end of the war.

The war memorial here features a sculpture by Gaston Broquet and it is recorded that the interior of the war memorial contains an urn with a sample of soil of the battlefield of Douaumont near Verdun. Broquet had had experience of the war having served in the 94th French Infantry.  Broquet's work can be seen in the depiction of the wounded Sergeant Maginot in the Maginot memorial near Fort de Souville and the horrified Poilu with gasmask of Samogneux.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memorial-genweb.org/~memorial2/html/fr/com_global.php?insee=88372&amp;dpt=88&amp;comm=Raon-l'Étape&amp; ''Raon-l'Etape'']{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Memorial genweb.

===Senones===

Senones lies north of Saint-Dié-des-Vosges and east of Raon-l'Étape.

There is a German War cemetery or Kriegsgräberstatte at Senones which contains 1,528 German burials. Of the 1,528 soldiers 784 are buried in a grave, and 22 individual soldiers of them are unknown. The mass grave contains the remains of 744 killed soldiers, only 348 of them are known by their name.  The "Schlacht in Lothringen" or the "Battle of Lorraine" from 25 to 28 August 1914, the defensive fighting in the winter 1914-1915, the trench warfare of 1915, and the war in late 1918 increased the number of dead in this sector of the front.  Soldiers, buried here, came from garrisons in Bavaria, Baden, Hessen, Hanover, Brunswick, Ostfriesland, Wurttemberg, Westphalia, Thuringia, Brandenburg, Silesia and the Rhineland.  On 25 August 1914, the Germans entered Senones on their march on St. Dié des Vosges and after the battle at la Chipotte and on 12 September 1914, units of the 30th Bavarian Reserve Division passing the defenceless town of Senones while retreating to return in the evening to occupy the town.

There is also a French War cemetery at Senones which contains the graves of 795 French Soldiers, including colonial soldiers. 372 of these soldiers are buried in 2 ossuaries. There are also 6 Poles, 11 Roumanians and 6 Russians buried in the cemetery. Soldiers buried here were brought in from the battlefields in the area around Bois du Palon, Bois "Y", la Scierie de Malfosse, la Chapelle de la Halte, the nearby Mère Henry and the Haute-Forain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pierreswesternfront.punt.nl/category/view/alsace-vosges-north Senones] pierreswesternfront.punt.nl.

|The original war memorial at Saint-Dié-des-Vosges was a most elaborate one with a French soldier at the top crushing the German Imperial eagle, the figure of Déodat, the founder of the town, and General Haxo and other figures, but this was demolished by the Germans during the occupation in the Second World War as they wanted to melt down the bronze for munitions manufacture.  Symbolically the town has left just the base of that monument standing as a reminder of the suffering which the town endured from 1940 to 1944, in particular the town's burning in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memorial-genweb.org/~memorial2/html/fr/com_global.php?insee=88413&amp;dpt=88&amp;comm=Saint-Dié-des-Vosges&amp; Saint-Dié-des-Vosges war memorial]{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Memorial Genweb.

|Ban-de-Sapt or Launois lies north of St Die des Vosges and between La Grande Fosse and the Petite Fosse.
There is a hill known as "La Fontenelles" near to Ban-de-Sapt which was strategically important in 1914, and on 14 September the 1st French Army took the area. Thereafter the Germans made every effort to retake it and as time went on it became a trench area where many tunnels were excavated and underground explosives detonated.  The front line eventually ran along the flanks of the hill. In 1915, the fighting was more intense and the French were able to gain some ground. In the French War cemetery of "La Fontenelle" at Ban-de-Sapt,  there is a monument remembering those killed in the 1915 fighting which includes the depiction of a Marianne and a French soldier.  See photograph above. This cemetery contains the remains of 1,384 Frenchmen of whom 424 lie in an ossuary. It was established in 1925.

== Some conclusions ==

The outcome of the battles in Lorraine and Alsace in 1914 effectively meant that the French plan XVII had failed and during the same period, and under tremendous pressure from the German armies advancing in the north,  the French and British armies had begun the [[Great Retreat]] to the [[Marne River]], pivoting on the fortress of [[Verdun-sur-Meuse|Verdun]]. So serious did he perceive the situation that [[Sir John French]] favoured withdrawing the BEF to the coast of the [[English Channel]] from where it could be evacuated, as he judged the BEF to be vulnerable and exposed but the British [[Secretary of State for War]], [[Horatio Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]], who ironically had never been in favour of the BEF's role alongside the French army, now insisted they stay side by side with the French.

The German Von Schlieffen Plan was now starting to show cracks and [[Helmuth Johann Ludwig von Moltke|Moltke]] was too prone to wavering and lacked the firm hand that was required. The German right wing had been weakened by the need to shift men and resources to bolster the offensive in [[East Prussia]] and to hold ground in [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]] and Von Kluck's decision to take his First Army east of the French capital rather than keeping to the west of Paris, as Von Schlieffen had insisted should happen, had exposed his right flank which the Allies exploited in the [[First Battle of the Marne]] in early September,  enabling the German advance to be halted.

The French no longer saw themselves achieving a swift, decisive victory and their priority now was to avoid defeat. Joffre, blamed the failure of Plan XVII squarely on the shoulders of his subordinates, claiming defeat stemmed from "grave shortcomings on the part of commanders."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tuchman|first=Barbara W.|title=The Guns of August|year=2004|publisher=Ballantine|location=New York|isbn=0345476093|edition=1st Presidio Press Mass Market|page=308}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many were sacked and even Lanrezac failed to escape Joffre's axe and was retired.

'''Investors in Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC''' lost billions of dollars in the [[Madoff investment scandal]], a [[Ponzi scheme]] [[fraud]] conducted by [[Bernard Madoff]]. The amount missing from client accounts, over two thirds of which were fabricated gains, was almost [[United States dollar|$]]65 billion.&lt;ref name="wsj031209"&gt;{{cite news | last =Bray | first =Chad | title =Madoff Pleads Guilty to Massive Fraud | work =[[The Wall Street Journal]] | publisher =Dow Jones, Inc | date =March 12, 2009 | url =https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123685693449906551?mod=djemalertNEWS | accessdate =March 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The court-appointed [[trust (law)|trustee]] estimated actual losses to investors of $18 billion and some of that money has been returned.&lt;ref name="9270960Minutes"&gt;{{cite news

Several newspapers and news services, including ''[[Bloomberg News]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', compiled lists of these investors during the first few months of the scandal, including fabricated gains in the amounts lost. These lists may include double-counting; for example, they may count investments by [[feeder fund]]s into Madoff Securities, as well as  investments made into the feeder funds.

[[File:LuigiAccameAndyWarhol.png|thumb|Andy Warhol: Portrait of Dr. Luigi Accame]]
[[File:Luigi Accame.jpg|thumb|Dr. Luigi Accame in 1959]]
'''Dr. Luigi Accame''' is a painting by American artist Andy Warhol. Warhol portrayed an Italian businessman from [[Genoa]], who from 1958 to 1963 served as a president of the Genoa [[Chamber of Commerce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.unioncamere.gov.it/P51A1445C1088S1087/Camera-di-Commercio-di-Genova.htm|title=Camera di Commercio di Genova |publisher=Unioncamere |access-date=2017-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974 Warhol made several polaroids and painted an original painting entitled "The Portrait of Dr. Luigi Accame".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.baltzer.com/en/auctions/11752/lots/28775|title=Painting "Dr. Luigi Accame" by Andy Warhol|last=|first=|date=|website=Baltzer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artnet.com/artists/andy-warhol/ritratto-del-dottor-luigi-accame-sDU4Ms6DXg7vHO8_JicloA2 |title="Ritratto Del Dottor Luigi Accame"|last=|first=|date=|website=Artnet|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was part of the series of portraits Warhol did of new, rich, patrons, including Shah of Iran [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], his wife Empress [[Farah Pahlavi]], his sister [[Princess Ashraf Pahlavi]], [[Mick Jagger]], [[Liza Minnelli]], [[John Lennon]], [[Diana Ross]], and [[Brigitte Bardot]]. According to [[Bob Colacello]], Warhol devoted much of his time in the 1970s to rounding up patrons for the portraits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8179627.stm|title=BBC NEWS {{!}} Entertainment {{!}} Warhol's Jackson goes to auction|website=news.bbc.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He commented it: "Making money is art, and working is art and good business is the best art."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Art of Sale|last=Broughton|first=Philip Delves|publisher=The Penguin Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York|pages=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to many other portraits, which Warhol reproduced as multiple prints, including those of [[Elvis Presley]], [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Jacqueline Kennedy]], or [[Mao Zedong]], "The portrait of Dr. Luigi Accame" is truly unique and Warhol made no similar work. In 1960s Accame published a book on doing business in Genoa&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Caratteristiche del Mercato Genovese - Relazione presentata al Convegno di Studi Economici e Sociali "Città di Genova"|last=Accame|first=Luigi|publisher=Ufficio Studi Sociali e del Lavoro del Commercio di Genova|year=1960|isbn=|location=Genova}}&lt;/ref&gt; and contributed chapters to other books,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=La mediazione e l'aspirante mediatore"Città di Genova"|last=Raffaele Addam|first=Giuseppe (with Introduction by Accame, Luigi)|publisher=Camera di commercio industria e agricoltura|year=1962|isbn=|location=Genova}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=I francesi a Genova nel 1859|last=Balestreri|first=Leonida (with Introduction by Accame, Luigi)|publisher=Camera di commercio industria e agricoltura|year=1959|isbn=|location=Genova}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he is famous primarily for being portrayed by Warhol. The painting is described in the Warhol's ''Catalogue Raisonné'' by Printz and King-Nero.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Andy Warhol Catalogue Raisonné of Paintings and Sculptures 1970-1974, vol. 3|last=Printz|first=N|last2=King-Nero|first2=S|publisher=|year=2010|isbn=|location=New York and London|pages= 497, no. 2783 (illustrated)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[RNA]] is [[transcription (genetics)|transcribed]] in the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]]; after [[post-transcriptional modification|processing]], it is transported to the [[cytoplasm]] and [[Translation (genetics)|translated]] by the [[ribosome]].  Finally, the mRNA is degraded.]]

'''Messenger RNA''' ('''mRNA''') is a large family of [[RNA]] [[molecule]]s that convey [[genetic information]] from [[DNA]] to the [[ribosome]], where they specify the [[amino acid]] sequence of the [[protein]] products of [[gene expression]]. [[RNA polymerase]] [[Transcription (genetics)|transcribes]] [[primary transcript]] mRNA (known as [[Precursor mRNA|pre-mRNA]]) into processed, [[mature messenger RNA|mature]] mRNA. This mature mRNA is then [[translation (genetics)|translated]] into a polymer of amino acids: a protein, as summarized in the [[central dogma of molecular biology]].

As in DNA, mRNA genetic information is in the sequence of [[nucleotides]], which are arranged into [[codons]] consisting of three base pairs each. Each codon encodes for a specific [[amino acid]], except the [[stop codon]]s, which terminate [[protein synthesis]]. This process of translation of codons into amino acids requires two other types of RNA: [[Transfer RNA]] (tRNA), that mediates recognition of the codon and provides the corresponding amino acid, and [[ribosomal RNA]] (rRNA), that is the central component of the ribosome's protein-manufacturing machinery.

The existence of mRNA was first suggested by [[Jacques Monod]] and [[François Jacob]], and subsequently discovered by Jacob, [[Sydney Brenner]] and [[Matthew Meselson]] at the [[California Institute of Technology]] in 1961.

It should not be confused with [[mitochondrial DNA]].

==Synthesis, processing and function==
The brief existence of an mRNA molecule begins with transcription, and ultimately ends in degradation.  During its life, an mRNA molecule may also be processed, edited, and transported prior to translation.  [[eukaryotes|Eukaryotic]] mRNA molecules often require extensive processing and transport, while [[prokaryotes|prokaryotic]] mRNA molecules do not. A molecule of eukaryotic mRNA and the proteins surrounding it are together called a [[messenger RNP]].

===Transcription===
{{main|Transcription (genetics)}}
Transcription is when RNA is made from DNA. During transcription, [[RNA polymerase]] makes a copy of a gene from the DNA to mRNA as needed. This process is similar in eukaryotes and prokaryotes.  One notable difference, however, is that eukaryotic RNA polymerase associates with mRNA-processing enzymes during transcription so that processing can proceed quickly after the start of transcription.  The short-lived, unprocessed or partially processed product is termed ''precursor mRNA'', or ''[[pre-mRNA]]''; once completely processed, it is termed ''[[mature mRNA]]''.

=== Eukaryotic pre-mRNA processing ===
{{main|Post-transcriptional modification}}
Processing of mRNA differs greatly among [[eukaryote]]s, [[bacteria]], and [[archea]].  Non-eukaryotic mRNA is, in essence, mature upon transcription and requires no processing, except in rare cases.  Eukaryotic pre-mRNA, however, requires extensive processing.

==== 5' cap addition ====
{{main|5' cap}}
A ''5' cap'' (also termed an RNA cap, an RNA [[7-methylguanosine]] cap, or an RNA m&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;G cap) is a modified guanine nucleotide that has been added to the "front" or [[5' end]] of a eukaryotic messenger RNA shortly after the start of transcription. The 5' cap consists of a terminal 7-methylguanosine residue that is linked through a 5'-5'-triphosphate bond to the first transcribed nucleotide. Its presence is critical for recognition by the [[ribosome]] and protection from [[RNase]]s.

Cap addition is coupled to transcription, and occurs co-transcriptionally, such that each influences the other.  Shortly after the start of transcription, the 5' end of the mRNA being synthesized is bound by a cap-synthesizing complex associated with [[RNA polymerase]].  This [[enzyme|enzymatic]] complex [[catalyze]]s the chemical reactions that are required for mRNA capping. Synthesis proceeds as a multi-step [[biochemistry|biochemical]] reaction.

====Editing====
In some instances, an mRNA will be [[RNA editing|edited]], changing the nucleotide composition of that mRNA.  An example in humans is the [[apolipoprotein B]] mRNA, which is edited in some tissues, but not others.  The editing creates an early stop codon, which, upon translation, produces a shorter protein.

==== Polyadenylation ====
{{main|Polyadenylation}}
Polyadenylation is the covalent linkage of a polyadenylyl moiety to a messenger RNA molecule. In eukaryotic organisms most messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules are polyadenylated at the 3' end, but recent studies have shown that short stretches of uridine (oligouridylation) are also common.&lt;ref&gt;Choi et al. RNA. 2012. 18: 394-401&lt;/ref&gt; The [[messenger RNA#Poly(A) tail|poly(A) tail]] and the protein bound to it aid in protecting mRNA from degradation by exonucleases. Polyadenylation is also important for transcription termination, export of the mRNA from the nucleus, and translation. mRNA can also be polyadenylated in prokaryotic organisms, where poly(A) tails act to facilitate, rather than impede, exonucleolytic degradation.

Polyadenylation occurs during and/or immediately after transcription of DNA into RNA. After transcription has been terminated, the mRNA chain is cleaved through the action of an endonuclease complex associated with RNA polymerase. After the mRNA has been cleaved, around 250 adenosine residues are added to the free 3' end at the cleavage site. This reaction is catalyzed by polyadenylate polymerase. Just as in alternative splicing, there can be more than one polyadenylation variant of an mRNA.

Polyadenylation site mutations also occur. The primary RNA transcript of a gene is cleaved at the poly-A addition site, and 100-200 A's are added to the 3’ end of the RNA. If this site is altered, an abnormally long and unstable mRNA construct will be formed.

===Transport===
Another difference between eukaryotes and prokaryotes is mRNA transport.  Because eukaryotic transcription and translation is compartmentally separated, eukaryotic mRNAs must be exported from the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] to the [[cytoplasm]]—a process that may be regulated by different signaling pathways.&lt;ref name=Quaresma2013&gt;{{citation |last1=Quaresma |first1=Alexandre J. |last2=Sievert |first2=Jeffrey A. |year=2013 |title=Regulation of mRNA export by the PI3 kinase/AKT signal transduction pathway |journal=Mol Biol Cell |volume=24 |issue=8 |pages=1208–21 |pmid=23427269 |doi=10.1091/mbc.E12-06-0450 |last3=Nickerson |first3=J. A. |pmc=3623641}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mature mRNAs are recognized by their processed modifications and then exported through the [[nuclear pore]] by binding to the cap-binding proteins CBP20 and CBP80,&lt;ref name=kierzkowski2009&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kierzkowski|first1=Daniel|last2=Kmieciak|first2=Maciej|last3=Piontek|first3=Paulina|last4=Wojtaszek|first4=Przemyslaw|last5=Szweykowska-Kulinska|first5=Zofia|last6=Jarmolowski|first6=Artur|title=The Arabidopsis CBP20 targets the cap-binding complex to the nucleus, and is stabilized by CBP80|journal=The Plant Journal|date=September 2009|volume=59|issue=5|pages=814–825|doi=10.1111/j.1365-313X.2009.03915.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2009.03915.x/abstract|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the transcription/export complex (TREX).&lt;ref name=strausser2002&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sträßer|first1=Katja|last2=Masuda|first2=Seiji|last3=Mason|first3=Paul|last4=Pfannstiel|first4=Jens|last5=Oppizzi|first5=Marisa|last6=Rodriguez-Navarro|first6=Susana|last7=Rondón|first7=Ana G.|last8=Aguilera|first8=Andres|last9=Struhl|first9=Kevin|last10=Reed|first10=Robin|last11=Hurt|first11=Ed|title=TREX is a conserved complex coupling transcription with messenger RNA export|journal=Nature|date=28 April 2002|volume=417|issue=6886|pages=304–308|doi=10.1038/nature746|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v417/n6886/full/nature746.html|accessdate=12 December 2014|pmid=11979277}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=katahira2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Katahira|first1=Jun|last2=Yoneda|first2=Yoshihiro|title=Roles of the TREX complex in nuclear export of mRNA|journal=RNA Biology|date=27 October 2014|volume=6|issue=2|pages=149–152|doi=10.4161/rna.6.2.8046|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.4161/rna.6.2.8046|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple mRNA export pathways have been identified in eukaryotes.&lt;ref name="Cenik2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cenik|first1=Can|last2=Chua|first2=Hon Nian|last3=Zhang|first3=Hui|last4=Tarnawsky|first4=Stefan P.|last5=Akef|first5=Abdalla|last6=Derti|first6=Adnan|last7=Tasan|first7=Murat|last8=Moore|first8=Melissa J.|last9=Palazzo|first9=Alexander F.|last10=Roth|first10=Frederick P.|title=Genome Analysis Reveals Interplay between 5′UTR Introns and Nuclear mRNA Export for Secretory and Mitochondrial Genes|journal=PLoS Genetics|volume=7|issue=4|year=2011|pages=e1001366|issn=1553-7404|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1001366|pmid=21533221|pmc=3077370}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spatially complex cells, some mRNAs are transported to particular subcellar destinations.  In mature [[neuron]]s, certain mRNA are transported from the [[Soma (biology)|soma]] to [[dendrite]]s.  One site of mRNA translation is at polyribosomes selectively localized beneath synapses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Steward|first1=Oswald|title=Preferential localization of polyribosomes under the base of dendritic spines in granule cells of the dentate gyrus|journal=Journal of Neuroscience|volume=2|pages=284–291}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mRNA for Arc/Arg3.1 is induced by synaptic activity and localizes selectively near active synapses based on signals generated by NMDA receptors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Steward|first1=Oswald|title=Selective targeting of newly-synthesized Arc mRNA to active synapses requires NMDA receptor activation|journal=Neuron|date=2001|volume=30|issue=1|pages=227–240|doi=10.1016/s0896-6273(01)00275-6|pmid=11343657}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other mRNAs also move into dendrites in response to external stimuli, such as β-actin mRNA.&lt;ref name=Job1912&gt;{{citation |last1=Job |first1=C. |last2=Eberwine |first2=J. |year=1912 |title=Localization and translation of mRNA in dendrites and axons |journal=Nat Rev Neurosci |volume= 2|issue=12 |pages=889–98 |pmid=11733796 |doi=10.1038/35104069}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon export from the nucleus, actin mRNA associates with [[ZBP1]] and the 40S subunit. The complex is bound by a motor protein and is transported to the target location (neurite extension) along the cytoskeleton. Eventually ZBP1 is phosphorylated by Src in order for translation to be initiated.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;Spatial regulation of bold beta-actin translation by Src-dependent phosphorylation of ZBP1 [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v438/n7067/abs/nature04115.html Nature04115].&lt;/ref&gt; In developing neurons, mRNAs are also transported into growing axons and especially growth cones.  Many mRNAs are marked with so-called "zip codes," which target their transport to a specific location.&lt;ref name=Ainger1997&gt;{{citation |last1=Ainger |first1=Kevin |last2=Avossa |first2=Daniela |last3=Diana |first3=Amy S. |last4=Barry |first4=Christopher |last5=Barbarese |first5=Elisa |last6=Carson |first6=John H. |year=1997 |title=Transport and Localization Elements in Myelin Basic Protein mRNA |journal=The Journal of Cell Biology |volume=138 |issue=5 |pages=1077–1087 |doi=10.1083/jcb.138.5.1077 |url=http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/138/5/1077 |pmid=9281585 |pmc=2136761}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Translation===
{{main|Translation (genetics)}}
Because prokaryotic mRNA does not need to be processed or transported, translation by the [[ribosome]] can begin immediately after the end of transcription.  Therefore, it can be said that prokaryotic translation is ''coupled'' to transcription and occurs ''co-transcriptionally''.

Eukaryotic mRNA that has been processed and transported to the cytoplasm (i.e., mature mRNA) can then be translated by the ribosome.  Translation may occur at [[ribosomes]] free-floating in the cytoplasm, or directed to the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] by the [[signal recognition particle]].  Therefore, unlike in prokaryotes, eukaryotic translation ''is not'' directly coupled to transcription.&lt;ref&gt;somalia&lt;/ref&gt; It is even possible in some contexts that reduced mRNA levels are accompanied by increased protein levels, as has been observed for mRNA/protein levels of EEF1A1 in breast cancer.&lt;ref name=Lin2018&gt;{{citation | last1 = Lin | first1 = C.Y. | last2 = Beattie | first2 = A. | last3 = Baradaran | first3 = B. | last4 = Dray | first4 = E. | last5 = Duijf | first5 = P.H.G. | year = 2018 | title = Contradictory mRNA and protein misexpression of EEF1A1 in ductal breast carcinoma due to cell cycle regulation and cellular stress | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 13904 | doi = 10.1038/s41598-018-32272-x | url = https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-32272-x | pmid = 30224719}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
[[File:MRNA structure.svg|thumb|700px|center|The structure of a mature eukaryotic mRNA. A fully processed mRNA includes a [[5' cap]], [[5' UTR]], [[coding region]], [[3' UTR]], and poly(A) tail.]]

=== Coding regions ===
{{main|Coding region}}
Coding regions are composed of [[codons]], which are decoded and translated (in eukaryotes usually into one and in prokaryotes usually into several) into proteins by the ribosome. Coding regions begin with the [[start codon]] and end with a [[stop codon]]. In general, the start codon is an AUG triplet and the stop codon is UAA, UAG, or UGA. The coding regions tend to be stabilised by internal base pairs, this impedes degradation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |vauthors=Shabalina SA, Ogurtsov AY, Spiridonov NA |title=A periodic pattern of mRNA secondary structure created by the genetic code |journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |volume=34 |issue=8 |pages=2428–37 |year=2006 |pmid=16682450 |pmc=1458515 |doi=10.1093/nar/gkl287}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |vauthors=Katz L, Burge CB |title=Widespread Selection for Local RNA Secondary Structure in Coding Regions of Bacterial Genes |journal=Genome Res. |volume=13 |issue=9 |pages=2042–51 |date=September 2003 |pmid=12952875 |pmc=403678 |doi=10.1101/gr.1257503}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to being protein-coding, portions of coding regions may serve as regulatory sequences in the [[pre-mRNA]] as [[exonic splicing enhancer]]s or [[exonic splicing silencer]]s.

=== Untranslated regions ===
{{main|5' UTR|3' UTR}}

Untranslated regions (UTRs) are sections of the mRNA before the start codon and after the stop codon that are not translated, termed the [[five prime untranslated region]] (5' UTR) and [[three prime untranslated region]] (3' UTR), respectively. These regions are transcribed with the coding region and thus are [[exon]]ic as they are present in the mature mRNA.  Several roles in gene expression have been attributed to the untranslated regions, including mRNA stability, mRNA localization, and [[translational efficiency]]. The ability of a UTR to perform these functions depends on the sequence of the UTR and can differ between mRNAs. Genetic variants in 3' UTR have also been implicated in disease susceptibility because of the change in RNA structure and protein translation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lu|first1=YF|last2=Mauger|first2=DM|last3=Goldstein|first3=DB|last4=Urban|first4=TJ|last5=Weeks|first5=KM|last6=Bradrick|first6=SS|title=IFNL3 mRNA structure is remodeled by a functional non-coding polymorphism associated with hepatitis C virus clearance.|journal=Scientific Reports|date=4 November 2015|volume=5|pages=16037|pmid=26531896|doi=10.1038/srep16037|pmc=4631997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stability of mRNAs may be controlled by the 5' UTR and/or 3' UTR due to varying affinity for RNA degrading enzymes called [[ribonuclease]]s and for ancillary proteins that can promote or inhibit RNA degradation. (See also, [[C-rich stability element]].)

Translational efficiency, including sometimes the complete inhibition of translation, can be controlled by UTRs.  Proteins that bind to either the 3' or 5' UTR may affect translation by influencing the ribosome's ability to bind to the mRNA. [[MicroRNA]]s bound to the [[3' UTR]] also may affect translational efficiency or mRNA stability.

Cytoplasmic localization of mRNA is thought to be a function of the 3' UTR.  Proteins that are needed in a particular region of the cell can also be translated there; in such a case, the 3' UTR may contain sequences that allow the transcript to be localized to this region for translation.

Some of the elements contained in untranslated regions form a characteristic [[secondary structure]] when transcribed into RNA.  These structural mRNA elements are involved in regulating the mRNA.  Some, such as the [[SECIS element]], are targets for proteins to bind.  One class of mRNA element, the [[riboswitch]]es, directly bind small molecules, changing their fold to modify levels of transcription or translation.  In these cases, the mRNA regulates itself.

===Poly(A) tail===
{{main|Polyadenylation}}
The 3' poly(A) tail is a long sequence of [[adenine]] nucleotides (often several hundred) added to the [[3' end]] of the pre-mRNA. This tail promotes export from the nucleus and translation, and protects the mRNA from degradation.

=== Monocistronic versus polycistronic mRNA ===
{{see also|Cistron}}
An mRNA molecule is said to be monocistronic when it contains the genetic information to [[Translation (genetics)|translate]] only a single [[protein]] chain (polypeptide). This is the case for most of the [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] mRNAs.&lt;ref name="Kozak_1983"&gt;

=== mRNA circularization ===
In eukaryotes mRNA molecules form circular structures due to an interaction between the [[eIF4E]] and [[poly(A)-binding protein]], which both bind to [[eIF4G]], forming an mRNA-protein-mRNA bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Wells | first1 = S.E. | last2 = Hillner | first2 = P.E. | last3 = Vale | first3 = R.D. | last4 = Sachs | first4 = A.B. | year = 1998 | title = Circularization of mRNA by Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factors | journal = Molecular Cell | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 135–140 | doi = 10.1016/S1097-2765(00)80122-7 | url = http://www.cell.com/molecular-cell/abstract/S1097-2765%2800%2980122-7 | format = w | pmid = 9702200}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Circularization is thought to promote cycling of ribosomes on the mRNA leading to time-efficient translation, and may also function to ensure only intact mRNA are translated (partially degraded mRNA characteristically have no m7G cap, or no poly-A tail).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | authors=López-Lastra M, Rivas A, Barría MI | year = 2005 | title = Protein synthesis in eukaryotes: The growing biological relevance of cap-independent translation initiation | journal = Biological Research | volume = 38 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 121–146 | doi = 10.4067/S0716-97602005000200003 | url = http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0716-97602005000200003&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en | pmid = 16238092}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other mechanisms for circularization exist, particularly in virus mRNA. [[Poliovirus]] mRNA uses a cloverleaf section towards its 5' end to bind PCBP2, which binds [[poly(A)-binding protein]], forming the familiar mRNA-protein-mRNA circle. [[Barley yellow dwarf virus]] has binding between mRNA segments on its 5' end and 3' end (called kissing stem loops), circularizing the mRNA without any proteins involved.

RNA virus genomes (the + strands of which are translated as mRNA) are also commonly circularized.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}  During genome replication the circularization acts to enhance genome replication speeds, cycling viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase much the same as the ribosome is hypothesized to cycle.

==Degradation==
Different mRNAs within the same cell have distinct lifetimes (stabilities).  In bacterial cells, individual mRNAs can survive from seconds to more than an hour. However, the lifetime averages between 1 and 3 minutes, making bacterial mRNA much less stable than eukaryotic mRNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/456641931|title=Lewin's genes X|date=2011|publisher=Jones and Bartlett|others=Lewin, Benjamin., Krebs, Jocelyn E., Kilpatrick, Stephen T., Goldstein, Elliott S., Lewin, Benjamin.|isbn=9780763766320|edition= 10th |location=Sudbury, Mass.|oclc=456641931}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In mammalian cells, mRNA lifetimes range from several minutes to days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yu|first1=Jia|last2=Russell|first2=J. Eric|title=Structural and Functional Analysis of an mRNP Complex That Mediates the High Stability of Human β-Globin mRNA|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC87307/pdf/mb005879.pdf|accessdate=4 June 2014|pmc=87307|pmid=11486027|volume=21|issue=17|journal=Mol Cell Biol|pages=5879–88|doi=10.1128/mcb.21.17.5879-5888.2001|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The greater the stability of an mRNA the more protein may be produced from that mRNA.  The limited lifetime of mRNA enables a cell to alter protein synthesis rapidly in response to its changing needs.  There are many mechanisms that lead to the destruction of an mRNA, some of which are described below.

===Prokaryotic mRNA degradation===
In general, in prokaryotes the lifetime of mRNA is much shorter than in eukaryotes.  Prokaryotes degrade messages by using a combination of ribonucleases, including endonucleases, 3' exonucleases, and 5' exonucleases.  In some instances, [[small RNA|small RNA molecules]] (sRNA) tens to hundreds of nucleotides long can stimulate the degradation of specific mRNAs by base-pairing with complementary sequences and facilitating ribonuclease cleavage by [[RNase III]].  It was recently shown that bacteria also have a sort of [[5' cap]] consisting of a triphosphate on the [[5' end]].&lt;ref name=Deana2008&gt;{{citation | last1 = Deana | first1 = Atilio | last2 = Celesnik | first2 = Helena | last3 = Belasco | first3 = Joel G. | year = 2008 | title = The bacterial enzyme RppH triggers messenger RNA degradation by 5' pyrophosphate removal | journal = Nature | volume = 451 | issue = 7176 | pages = 355–8 | doi = 10.1038/nature06475 | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v451/n7176/abs/nature06475.html | pmid = 18202662}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Removal of two of the phosphates leaves a 5' monophosphate, causing the message to be destroyed by the exonuclease [[RNase J]], which degrades 5' to 3'.

===Eukaryotic mRNA turnover===
Inside eukaryotic cells, there is a balance between the processes of [[Translation (genetics)|translation]] and mRNA decay.  Messages that are being actively translated are bound by [[ribosome]]s, the [[eukaryotic initiation factor]]s [[eIF-4E]] and [[eIF-4G]], and [[poly(A)-binding protein]].  eIF-4E and eIF-4G block the decapping enzyme ([[DCP2]]), and poly(A)-binding protein blocks the [[exosome complex]], protecting the ends of the message.  The balance between translation and decay is reflected in the size and abundance of cytoplasmic structures known as [[P-bodies]]&lt;ref name=Parker2007&gt;{{citation | last1 = Parker | first1 = R. | last2 = Sheth | first2 = U. | year = 2007 | title = P Bodies and the Control of mRNA Translation and Degradation | journal = Molecular Cell | volume = 25 | issue = 5 | pages = 635–646 | doi = 10.1016/j.molcel.2007.02.011 | url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1097276507001116 | format = w | pmid = 17349952}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[polyadenylation|poly(A) tail]] of the mRNA is shortened by specialized exonucleases that are targeted to specific messenger RNAs by a combination of cis-regulatory sequences on the RNA and trans-acting RNA-binding proteins.  Poly(A) tail removal is thought to disrupt the circular structure of the message and destabilize the [[cap binding complex]].  The message is then subject to degradation by either the [[exosome complex]] or the [[decapping complex]].  In this way, translationally inactive messages can be destroyed quickly, while active messages remain intact.  The mechanism by which translation stops and the message is handed-off to decay complexes is not understood in detail.

===AU-rich element decay===
The presence of [[AU-rich element]]s in some mammalian mRNAs tends to destabilize those transcripts through the action of cellular proteins that bind these sequences and stimulate [[poly(A)]] tail removal. Loss of the poly(A) tail is thought to promote mRNA degradation by facilitating attack by both the [[exosome complex]]&lt;ref name=Chen2001&gt;{{citation | last1 = Chen | first1 = C.Y. | last2 = Gherzi | first2 = R. | last3 = Ong | first3 = S.E. | last4 = Chan | first4 = E.L. | last5 = Raijmakers | first5 = R. | last6 = Pruijn | first6 = G.J.M. | last7 = Stoecklin | first7 = G. | last8 = Moroni | first8 = C. | last9 = Mann | first9 = M. | year = 2001 | title = AU Binding Proteins Recruit the Exosome to Degrade ARE-Containing mRNAs | journal = Cell | volume = 107 | issue = 4 | pages = 451–464 | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(01)00578-5 | url = http://www.cell.com/cgi/content/full/107/4/451/ | pmid = 11719186 | last10 = Karin | first10 = Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[decapping complex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |vauthors=Fenger-Grøn M, Fillman C, Norrild B, Lykke-Andersen J |title=Multiple processing body factors and the ARE binding protein TTP activate mRNA decapping |journal=Mol.

===Nonsense mediated decay===
{{main|Nonsense mediated decay}}

Eukaryotic messages are subject to surveillance by [[nonsense mediated decay]] (NMD), which checks for the presence of premature stop codons (nonsense codons) in the message.  These can arise via incomplete splicing, [[V(D)J recombination]] in the [[adaptive immune system]], mutations in DNA, transcription errors, [[leaky scanning]] by the ribosome causing a [[frame shift]], and other causes.  Detection of a premature stop codon triggers mRNA degradation by 5' decapping, 3' [[poly(A)]] tail removal, or [[endonuclease|endonucleolytic cleavage]].&lt;ref name=Isken2007&gt;{{citation | last1 = Isken | first1 = O. | last2 = Maquat | first2 = L.E. | year = 2007 | title = Quality control of eukaryotic mRNA: safeguarding cells from abnormal mRNA function | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 21 | pmid = 17671086 | issue = 15 | pages = 1833–56 | url = http://www.genesdev.org/cgi/content/full/21/15/1833 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1566807}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Small interfering RNA (siRNA)===
{{main|siRNA}}

In [[metazoan]]s, [[small interfering RNA]]s (siRNAs) processed by [[Dicer]] are incorporated into a complex known as the [[RNA-induced silencing complex]] or RISC.  This complex contains an [[endonuclease]] that cleaves perfectly complementary messages to which the siRNA binds.  The resulting mRNA fragments are then destroyed by [[exonuclease]]s.  siRNA is commonly used in laboratories to block the function of genes in cell culture.  It is thought to be part of the innate immune system as a defense against double-stranded RNA viruses.&lt;ref name=Obbard2009&gt;{{citation | last1 = Obbard | first1 = D.J. | last2 = Gordon | first2 = K.H.J. | last3 = Buck | first3 = A.H. | last4 = Jiggins | first4 = F.M. | year = 2009 | title = The evolution of RNAi as a defence against viruses and transposable elements | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume = 364 | issue = 1513 | pages = 99–115 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.2008.0168 | pmid = 18926973 | pmc = 2592633}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MicroRNA (miRNA)===
{{main|microRNA}}

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNAs that typically are partially complementary to sequences in metazoan messenger RNAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |vauthors=Brennecke J, Stark A, Russell RB, Cohen SM |title=Principles of MicroRNA–Target Recognition |journal=PLoS Biol. |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=e85 |date=March 2005 |pmid=15723116 |pmc=1043860 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0030085}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Binding of a miRNA to a message can repress translation of that message and accelerate poly(A) tail removal, thereby hastening mRNA degradation.  The mechanism of action of miRNAs is the subject of active research.&lt;ref name=Eulalio2009&gt;{{citation | last1 = Eulalio | first1 = A. | last2 = Huntzinger | first2 = E. | last3 = Nishihara | first3 = T. | last4 = Rehwinkel | first4 = J. | last5 = Fauser | first5 = M. | last6 = Izaurralde | first6 = E. | year = 2009 | title = Deadenylation is a widespread effect of miRNA regulation | journal = RNA | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | pages = 21–32 | doi = 10.1261/rna.1399509 | pmid = 19029310 | pmc = 2612776}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other decay mechanisms===
There are other ways by which messages can be degraded, including [[non-stop decay]] and silencing by [[Piwi-interacting RNA]] (piRNA), among others.

Theoretically, the administered mRNA sequence can cause a cell to make a protein, which in turn could directly treat a disease or could function as a [[vaccine]]; more indirectly the protein could drive an endogenous [[stem cell]] to differentiate in a desired way.&lt;ref name=NatRevMat&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hajj|first1=Khalid A.|last2=Whitehead|first2=Kathryn A.|title=Tools for translation: non-viral materials for therapeutic mRNA delivery|journal=Nature Reviews Materials|date=12 September 2017|volume=2|issue=10|pages=17056|doi=10.1038/natrevmats.2017.56}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GEN"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gousseinov|first1=Elina|last2=Kozlov|first2=Mikhail|last3=Scanlan|first3=Claire|last4=Hammons|first4=Aaron|last5=Bei|first5=Ling|last6=Benchek|first6=Youssef|last7=Pirani|first7=Karim|last8=Pattnaik|first8=Priyabrata|last9=Waghmare|first9=Ruta|title=RNA-Based Therapeutics and Vaccines|url=https://www.genengnews.com/gen-exclusives/rna-based-therapeutics-and-vaccines/77900520|work=Genetic Engineering News|date=September 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary challenges of RNA therapy center on delivering the RNA to directed cells, more even than determining what sequence to deliver.&lt;ref name="genemed"/&gt; Naked RNA sequences will naturally degrade after preparation; they may trigger the body's [[immune system]] to attack them as an invader; and they are [[Semipermeable membrane|impermeable]] to the [[cell membrane]].&lt;ref name="GEN"/&gt; Once within the cell, they must then leave the cell's transport mechanism to take action within the [[cytoplasm]], which houses the [[ribosomes]] that direct manufacture of [[proteins]].&lt;ref name=NatRevMat/&gt;

In 2000 in [[London]], an eight-year-old [[Ivory Coast|Ivorian]] girl, '''Victoria Adjo Climbié''' (2 November 1991 – 25 February 2000), was tortured and murdered by her guardians. Her death led to a [[public inquiry]] and produced major changes in [[child welfare|child protection]] policies in the United Kingdom.

Born in [[Abobo]], [[Côte d’Ivoire]], Climbié left the country with her great-aunt Marie-Thérèse Kouao, a French citizen, for an education in France, where they travelled, before arriving in London in April 1999. It is not known exactly when Kouao started abusing Climbié, although it is suspected to have worsened when Kouao and Climbié met and moved in with Carl Manning, who became Kouao's boyfriend. During the abuse, Climbié was burnt with cigarettes, tied up for periods of longer than 24 hours, and hit with bike chains, hammers and wires.  Up to her death, the [[Law enforcement in the United Kingdom|police]], the [[social work|social services]] department of four [[local government in the United Kingdom|local authorities]], the [[National Health Service]], the [[National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children]] (NSPCC), and local churches all had contact with her, and noted the signs of abuse. However, in what the judge in the trial following Climbié's death described as "blinding incompetence", all failed to properly investigate the case and little action was taken. Kouao and Manning were convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment.

After Climbié's death, the parties involved in her case were widely criticised. A public inquiry, headed by [[Herbert Laming, Baron Laming|Lord Laming]], was ordered. It discovered numerous instances where Climbié could have been saved, noted that many of the organisations involved in her care were badly run, and discussed the racial aspects surrounding the case, as many of the participants were black. The subsequent report by Laming made numerous recommendations related to child protection in England. Climbié's death was largely responsible for the formation of the [[Every Child Matters]] initiative; the introduction of the [[Children Act 2004]]; the creation of the [[ContactPoint]] project, a [[government database]] designed to hold information on all children in England (now defunct after closure by the government of 2010); and the creation of the Office of the Children's Commissioner chaired by the [[Children's Commissioner for England]].

== Life ==
Victoria Climbié was born on 2 November 1991 in [[Abobo]] near [[Abidjan]], Ivory Coast, the fifth of seven children.&lt;ref&gt;Verkaik, Robert.

Retrieved 1 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Marie-Thérèse Kouao, Francis' aunt, was born on 17 July 1956 in Bonoua, Ivory Coast, and lived in France with her three sons, claiming [[welfare benefits]].&lt;ref name=p25 /&gt;&lt;ref name=p46&gt;Laming, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; She divorced her former husband in 1978 and he died in 1995.&lt;ref name=p46 /&gt; Kouao was attending her brother's funeral in the Ivory Coast when she visited the Climbié family in October 1998. She informed them that she wanted to take a child back to France with her and arrange for their education; this sort of informal [[fosterage]] is common in the family's society. Victoria Climbié was apparently happy to be chosen,&lt;ref name=p25 /&gt; and although her parents had met Kouao only a few times, they were satisfied with the arrangements.

From that point onwards, Kouao pretended that Climbié was her daughter. Kouao had originally planned to take another young girl called Anna Kouao, but Anna's parents changed their minds. Climbié travelled on a French passport in the name of Anna Kouao and was known as Anna throughout her life in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=p25 /&gt; It is not known exactly when Kouao started abusing Climbié. Climbié's parents received three messages about her from when she left them until her death, all saying she was in good health.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1563908.stm "Climbie case is 'turning point'"]. [[BBC News]]. 26 September 2001. Retrieved 1 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kouao and Climbié left the Ivory Coast possibly in November 1998 and flew to Paris, France, where Climbié enrolled at school.&lt;ref name=p25 /&gt; By December 1998, however, Kouao began to receive warnings about Climbié's [[absenteeism]], and in February 1999, the school issued a child-at-risk notification and a [[social work]]er became involved. The school observed how Climbié tended to fall asleep in class, and the headteacher later recalled Kouao's mentioning Climbié suffering from some form of [[dermatology|dermatological]] condition and that, on her last visit to the school on 25 March 1999, Climbié had a shaven head and was wearing a wig.&lt;ref name=p26&gt;Laming, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; When they left France, Kouao owed the authorities £2,000, after being wrongly paid in [[child benefit]], and it is claimed that Kouao viewed Climbié as a useful tool for claiming benefits.&lt;ref name=horror&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1102191.stm "Victoria's life of horror"]. [[BBC News]]. 12 January 2001. Retrieved 1 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Kouao had also been evicted from her home in France because of rent arrears.&lt;ref name=p46 /&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
On 24 April 1999, Kouao and Victoria Climbié left France and travelled to the United Kingdom, where they settled in [[London Borough of Ealing|Ealing]], West London.&lt;ref name=p26 /&gt; They had a reservation in a bed and breakfast at Twyford Crescent, [[Acton (London)|Acton]], where they lived until 1 May 1999, when they moved to Nicoll Road, [[Harlesden]], in the [[London Borough of Brent]].&lt;ref&gt;Laming, pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 April 1999, Kouao and Climbié visited Esther Ackah, a distant relative of Kouao by marriage, and a midwife, counsellor and preacher.&lt;ref name=key /&gt;&lt;ref name=p26 /&gt; Ackah and her daughter noted that Climbié was wearing a wig and looked small and frail.&lt;ref name=p26 /&gt; On 26 April 1999, Kouao and Climbié visited the Homeless Persons' Unit of [[Ealing Council]], where they were seen by Julie Winter, a homeless persons' officer. Together, Kouao and Winter completed a housing application form.&lt;ref name=p46 /&gt; Kouao explained that Climbié was wearing a wig because she had short hair, an explanation accepted by Winter. Although Winter was shown Climbié's passport (with a photograph of Anna), she paid no attention to them, believing that Kouao's application was ineligible on the grounds of [[habitual residence]]. Winter confirmed her decision with her duty senior and told Kouao that she was not eligible for housing.&lt;ref name=p47&gt;Laming, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; She telephoned the referral across to Pamela Fortune, a social worker in Ealing's Acton referral and assessment team. She did not produce a written or electronic documentation of the referral, however, something which would have helped in double-checking the accounts that Kouao gave.&lt;ref name=p48&gt;Laming, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 26 April and early July 1999, Kouao visited Ealing [[social services]] 18 times for housing and financial purposes. Climbié was with her on at least ten occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Laming, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; The staff there noted Victoria's unkempt appearance, with one staff member, Deborah Gaunt, thinking that she looked like a child from an [[ActionAid]] advertisement.&lt;ref name=p27 /&gt; However, they did not take any action and may have assumed that Victoria's appearance was a purposeful attempt to "persuade the authorities to hand out money".&lt;ref name=twelve&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2122256.stm "Could Victoria have been saved?"]. [[BBC News]]. 11 July 2002. Retrieved 8 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 June 1999, Kouao got a job at [[Northwick Park Hospital]].&lt;ref name=p28&gt;Laming, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; During her first month, no effort was made by Kouao or Ealing social services to enroll Climbié in educational or daycare activities.&lt;ref name=p27&gt;Laming, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 June 1999, Kouao took Climbié to a local [[General practitioner|GP]] surgery. The [[practice nurse]] there did not carry out a physical examination as she was not reported to have any current health problems.&lt;ref name=p27 /&gt; By the middle of June 1999, Victoria was spending the majority of her days at the Brent home of Priscilla Cameron, an unregistered childminder, who Kouao met at her job at the hospital.&lt;ref name=p28 /&gt;&lt;ref name=shortcoming&gt;For Priscilla Cameron living in Brent, see [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1595517.stm "Climbie social worker admits 'shortcoming'"]. [[BBC News]]. 12 October 2001. Retrieved 11 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no evidence that Climbié was treated badly during her time with Cameron. On several occasions, Cameron observed small cuts to Climbié's fingers. When questioned by Cameron, Kouao said that they were caused by razor blades that Climbié played with.&lt;ref name=p28 /&gt; Kouao and Victoria met Ackah on the street on or around 14 June 1999. In what may have been early signs of deliberate physical harm, Ackah noted a scar on Climbié's cheek, which Kouao said was caused by a fall on an escalator. On 17 June 1999, in response to what she had seen three days earlier, Ackah visited Kouao and Climbié's home, and thought that the accommodation was unsuitable.&lt;ref name=p27 /&gt;

On 18 June 1999, Ackah anonymously telephoned [[Brent Council|Brent social services]], expressing concern over Climbié's situation.&lt;ref&gt;Laming, pp. 85–86.&lt;/ref&gt; Samantha Hunt, the customer-service officer who received the call at the One Stop Shop at Brent House, faxed the referral to the children's social work department on that same day.&lt;ref name=p86&gt;Laming, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; Nobody picked up the referral on that Friday afternoon, and what happened to it was—according to [[Herbert Laming, Baron Laming|Lord Laming]], who headed the subsequent inquiry—the subject of "some of the most bizarre and contradictory evidence" the inquiry heard.&lt;ref name=p87&gt;Laming, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later, possibly on 21 June 1999, Ackah phoned Brent social services again to make sure her concerns were being addressed. Ackah said that she was told by the person on the other end of the telephone that "probably they [social services] had done something about it".&lt;ref name=p89&gt;Laming, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; This call, however, did not trigger a new, separate referral.&lt;ref name=p89 /&gt; 

The first referral was not seen until three weeks later on 6 July 1999, when Robert Smith, the group administrative officer, logged the details of the referral onto the computer, with details of Climbié's injuries. Laming said the delay constituted "a significant missed opportunity" to protect Climbié.&lt;ref name=p87 /&gt; Edward Armstrong, the team manager of the intake duty team, said that he completed a duty manager's action sheet not for the 18 June referral, which he said never arrived in his office, but for the 21 June referral, which was a less serious case than the first; Laming called this version of events "wholly unbelievable".&lt;ref name=p88&gt;Laming, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=p90&gt;Laming, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Laming said that Armstrong's evidence was out of line with that of the other Brent witnesses, that the quality of it "[left] much to be desired", and that Armstrong's insistence that he dealt with the 21 June referral was an attempt to cover up his team's "inept handling" of a genuine child protection case.&lt;ref name=p88 /&gt;&lt;ref name=p9091&gt;Laming, pp. 90–91.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 June 1999, Kouao and Climbié met Carl Manning (born 31 October 1972)&lt;ref name=chron&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130130090929/http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ERORecords/VC/2/2/P2/Background/back_chron.htm "Chronology"]. The Victoria Climbié Inquiry. Retrieved 1 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; on a bus which he was driving. This was the start of Kouao and Manning's relationship which ended at the time of their arrest eight months later.&lt;ref name=p28 /&gt; She was his first girlfriend.&lt;ref name=horror /&gt; The relationship developed quickly and on 6 July 1999, Kouao and Climbié moved into Manning's one-bedroom flat at Somerset Gardens in [[Tottenham]], in the [[London Borough of Haringey]]. There is evidence that Climbié's abuse increased soon after moving into Manning's flat.&lt;ref name=p28 /&gt;

On 7 July 1999, Brent social services sent a letter to Nicoll Road, where Kouao and Climbié were staying, informing them of a home visit. On 14 July 1999, two social workers, Lori Hobbs and Monica Bridgeman, visited the address but found no answer: Kouao and Climbié had already moved out on 6 July 1999. Hobbs and Bridgeman made no further inquiries at the property, inquiries that might have led to a trail on Climbié's whereabouts.&lt;ref name=p91&gt;Laming, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the visit, they had not done any background checks and had only the "haziest idea" of what they were investigating.&lt;ref name=p92&gt;Laming, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; The Laming report suggests that no reports or follow-up notes were made and that the only information additional to the referral were the notes "Not at this address. Have moved."&lt;ref name=p93&gt;Laming, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First hospital admission ===
On 13 July 1999, Kouao took Climbié to Cameron's house, asking her to take Climbié permanently because Manning did not want her. Cameron refused but agreed to take her for the night.&lt;ref name=p28 /&gt; Cameron, her son Patrick, and her daughter Avril, observed that Climbié had numerous injuries—including a burn on her face and a loose piece of skin hanging from her right eyelid—which Kouao said was self-inflicted.&lt;ref name=p29&gt;Laming, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=p239&gt;Laming, p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt; Manning's account in the subsequent inquiry differed and he said that he hit Climbié because of her incontinence, beginning with slaps, but progressing to using his fist by the end of July. It was highly likely that at least some of the injuries were the result of deliberate physical harm.&lt;ref name=p29 /&gt;

The next day, on 14 July 1999, Cameron's daughter Avril took Climbié to see Marie Cader, a French teacher at her son's school. Cader advised that Climbié be taken to hospital. At 11:00 am the same day, Avril took Climbié to the [[emergency department]] of [[Central Middlesex Hospital]].&lt;ref name=p29 /&gt; At 11:50&amp;nbsp;am, Climbié was seen by Dr Rhys Beynon, a senior house officer in the department.&lt;ref name=p239 /&gt; Beynon took Climbié's history from Avril and thought that there was a strong possibility that the injuries were non-accidental.&lt;ref&gt;Laming, pp. 239–240.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to hospital child protection guidelines, he referred the case to Dr Ekundayo Ajayi-Obe, the on-call paediatric registrar. Beynon conducted only a cursory examination of Climbié because he believed she was going to be examined by the paediatric team. The Laming report said that "he exhibited sound judgement in his care of Victoria by referring her immediately to a paediatric registrar."&lt;ref name=Laming240&gt;Laming, p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt; Climbié arrived at Barnaby Bear ward where she was examined by Ajayi-Obe, who noted various injuries. When asked about the injuries, Climbié said they were self-inflicted, a claim the paediatrician did not think was credible.&lt;ref name=Laming241&gt;Laming, p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt; Ajayi-Obe's notes were detailed and thorough, in contrast to those of the other doctors that examined her. Having examined Climbié, the paediatrician was "strongly suspicious" that the injuries were non-accidental, and she decided to admit Climbié onto the ward.&lt;ref name=Laming242&gt;Laming, p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt;

The doctors alerted Brent police and social services, and she was placed under police protection, with a 72-hour protection order preventing her from leaving hospital. Kouao told the doctors that she had [[scabies]], and that the injuries were self-inflicted. Many doctors and nurses suspected that the injuries were non-accidental.&lt;ref&gt;Batty, David.

Some time in July, probably just before Climbié was admitted to the Central Middlesex Hospital, Kouao befriended a couple, Julien and Chantal Kimbidima. Climbié and Kouao visited their home several times over the following months. According to Chantal, Kouao would shout at Climbié all the time and never showed her affection.&lt;ref&gt;Laming, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second hospital admission ===
[[File:North Middlesex Hospital.jpg|thumb|North Middlesex Hospital where Climbié was discharged after being treated for severe scalding]]
On 24 July 1999, Climbié was taken by Kouao to the [[emergency department|accident-and-emergency department]] at [[North Middlesex Hospital]] with severe [[burn (injury)|scalding]] to her head and other injuries. The hospital found no evidence of scabies. Consultant Mary Rossiter felt Climbié was being abused but still wrote 'able to discharge' on her notes.&lt;ref name="chain of neglect"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2700427.stm "Victoria Climbie: Chain of neglect"].

Later, in the inquiry, Rossiter said that by writing 'able to discharge', she did not mean she wanted Climbié to go home, merely that she was physically fit to leave. Garnham said, "quite how the subtlety of that distinction was to be ascertained from the notes is far from obvious".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20031011074227/http://www.victoria-climbie-inquiry.org.uk/News_Update/nov.htm#9NOV01#9NOV01 "Witnesses to be Called in Week Beginning 12 November"].

A social worker and a police officer from Haringey council, Lisa Arthurworrey and Karen Jones, respectively, were assigned to her case, and were scheduled to make a home visit on 4 August 1999; however, the visit was cancelled once they heard about the scabies. Jones later said, "it might not be logical but I did not know anything about scabies." She said that she telephoned North Middlesex Hospital for information about the disease, but Garnham had evidence that the staff there dealt with no such inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1664755.stm "Climbie officer 'feared scabies'"].

On 5 August 1999, a Haringey social worker, Barry Almeida, took Climbié to an NSPCC centre in Tottenham, where she was assigned to Sylvia Henry. There was some confusion as to why the centre was being referred to for the case. Henry later contacted Almeida and was told, according to Henry, that Climbié had moved out of the borough, thereby closing the case. Almeida said he could not remember whether this conversation did take place. On the same day, Kouao met Arthurworrey and Jones at the Haringey social services department, and claimed that Climbié had poured boiling water over herself to stop the itching caused by the scabies and that she had used utensils to cause the other injuries. The social worker and police officer believed her, deciding that the injuries were probably accidental, and allowed Climbié to return home the following day, which she did.&lt;ref name="BBC timeline"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2062590.stm "Timeline: Victoria Climbie"].

Arthurworrey said in the inquiry that she was under the impression that Climbié seemed happy, but Garnham criticised Arthurworrey for not detecting any of the abuse, although Manning had described this visit as a "put up job".&lt;ref name="Laming, p. 33"&gt;Laming, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; Arthurworrey and Climbié had met on four occasions, where they were together for a total of less than 30 minutes, barely speaking to each other.&lt;ref name="twelve"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1677167.stm "Social worker admits mistakes"].

From then on, Kouao kept Climbié away from hospitals, turning instead to churches. Kouao said to the pastors that she was the mother and that [[demonic possession|demons were inside]] Climbié. The pastor at the Mission Ensemble Pour Christ, Pascal Orome, offered prayers for Climbié to cast out the devil, and thought that her injuries were due to demonic possession.&lt;ref name=key /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1586816.stm "Cleric said Climbie was 'possessed'"].

He said in the inquiry that Climbié told him that [[Satan]] had told her to burn herself. The pastor did not believe her, but he still believed that a person could be possessed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1695601.stm "Pastor prayed for 'possessed' Victoria"].

From October 1999 to January 2000, Manning forced Climbié to sleep in a [[bin liner]] in the bathtub in her own excrement. During a later police interview, Manning said this was because of her frequent [[bedwetting]]. At Haringey social services on 1 November 1999, Kouao told social workers that Manning [[child sexual abuse|sexually assaulted]] Climbié, but withdrew the accusation the following day. In one of Arthurworrey's visits, during a conversation about housing, Arthurworrey said that the council accommodated only children who were believed to be at serious risk. Laming said in his report, "it may be no coincidence that within three days of this conversation, Kouao contacted Ms. Arthurworrey to make allegations which, if true, would have placed Victoria squarely within that category".&lt;ref name="Laming, p. 33"/&gt; Jones sent a letter to Kouao, which was ignored, and no further action was taken.&lt;ref name="BBC timeline"/&gt; Manning later denied the allegation.

She speculated to her supervisor, Carole Baptiste, that they had returned to France. Despite no evidence, her supervisor wrote on Climbié's file that they had left the area. On 18 February 2000 they wrote to Kouao saying that if they did not receive any contact from them, they would close the case.

=== Laming controversy ===
Laming's appointment was controversial as he had been director of [[Hertfordshire|Hertfordshire county council]]'s social services department in 1990, a department which was strongly criticised for its handling of a child abuse case, and which had the [[Local Government Ombudsman]] making a finding of '[[maladministration]] with injustice' against them in 1995. The father of the child in the case said of Laming's appointment, "I don't see how he has the qualifications or experience to be able to lead an investigation into another borough which has been failing to protect a child in exactly the same manner that his own authority failed to protect a child in 1990".&lt;ref&gt;Verkaik, Robert.

=== Obstruction of evidence ===
Several documents were submitted late or in suspicious circumstances to the inquiry. A report by the SSI was submitted late because the SSI presumed the document was not relevant to the inquiry. The report was produced in April 2001 but was not handed over to the inquiry until 2002. An earlier report by the Joint Review about Haringey social services, which was heavily relied upon during the inquiry, said that service users were "generally well served"; the SSI report said that the former report presented "an overly positive picture of Haringey's social services, particularly children's services".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2038309.stm "New Climbie hearing over 'missing report'"].

=== Criticism of agencies ===
Following Victoria Climbié's death, the agencies in the case, as well as the child services system in general, were widely criticised. Milburn said, "this was not a failing on the part of one service, it was a failing on the part of every service".&lt;ref&gt;[http://society.guardian.co.uk/climbie/story/0,,884088,00.html "Full text: Alan Milburn's statement on the Laming report"].

=== Criticism of the report ===
The Laming report was criticised by Caroline Abrahams and Deborah Lightfoot of [[Action for Children|NCH]] as too narrow, focusing too much on the particular case of Victoria Climbié and not on general child protection.&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Abrahams and Deborah Lightfoot writing in ''The Guardian''.

''[[The Guardian]]'' discussed the media attention surrounding the case, noticing how [[sensationalism|sensational]] events received widespread coverage, yet important but less exciting events received less. It states that only it and ''[[The Independent]]'' of the national newspapers gave significant coverage to the evidence in the hearings. A possible explanation is given as, "much of the evidence has been concerned with social services, which many other papers view as a [[political correctness|politically correct]] waste of money for the undeserving".&lt;ref&gt;Batty, David.[http://society.guardian.co.uk/climbie/comment/0,,635712,00.html "Sensationalism will obscure the point of the Climbié inquiry"].

Only pressure from the opposition and local press got the decision reversed. As George Meehan only reversed his decision just before the meeting, a driver was rushed to Acton to escort Francis and Berthe Climbié and Mor Dioum, their interpreter, to the council. At the meeting, the Climbiés attacked the council, through their interpreter, for its handling of the case, especially in its dealing with the Laming Inquiry. (Mor Dioum later went on to be the Director of the Victoria Climbié Foundation.)

The government placed Haringey social services department under [[special measures]], requiring close supervision by the social services inspectorate.

Climbié's death was largely responsible for various changes in child protection in England, including the formation of the [[Every Child Matters]] programme, an initiative designed to improve the lives of children; the introduction of the [[Children Act 2004]], an [[Act of Parliament]] that provides the legislative base for many of the reforms; the creation of [[ContactPoint]], a database designed to hold information on all children in [[England and Wales]] (now no longer in operation); and the creation of the post of [[Children's Commissioner for England|children's commissioner]], who heads the Office of the Children's Commissioner, a national agency serving children and families.

Nelson was [[foal]]ed in 1763 and was given to Washington in 1778 by [[Thomas Nelson Jr.|Thomas Nelson]] of Virginia, after whom the horse was then named.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ushistory.org/valleyforge/youasked/024.htm | title=George Washington's horse | accessdate=May 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Washington stated that Nelson was his most favored horse to use during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], as he was not easily provoked by gunfire.&lt;ref name=Mountvernon/&gt;  The other horse he rode during the Revolutionary War, and on whom he is more often portrayed, was his [[gray (horse)|gray]] horse, [[Blueskin (horse)|Blueskin]].&lt;ref name=Cowboy&gt;{{cite web|last1=Feldman|first1=Laura|title=Horses of War|url=http://www.americancowboy.com/article/horses-war-23983|website=American Cowboy|accessdate=20 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Washington ceased to ride Nelson after the war. Nelson and Blueskin were retired and lived at Mount Vernon post-war.&lt;ref name=Mountvernon/&gt;

'''Orthodox seeds''' are [[seed]]s which will survive drying and/or freezing during [[ex-situ conservation]]. According to information from the [[USDA| U.S. Department of Agriculture]], there is variation in the ability of orthodox seeds to withstand drying and storage, with some seeds being more sensitive than others.

'''''Pokémon Sage''''' is an upcoming [[role-playing video game|role-playing]] video game developed by members of the [[4chan]] board /vp/.

==Gameplay==
{{further|Gameplay of Pokémon}}
''Pokémon Sage''{{'}}s gameplay is standard for the ''[[Pokémon (video game series)|Pokémon]]'' series. However, it includes an entirely new [[Pokédex]]. The [[Starter Pokémon]] are the avian Grass-type Foliat, the goat-like Fire-type Kidling, and the reptilian Water-type Aguade.

==Setting and plot==
''Pokémon Sage'' takes place in a fictional region called Urobos. Urobos is loosely based on [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]], with many ''Pokémon'', though not all, being related to the real-life region. It features a lush jungle to the south-west, snowy mountains to the north-west, and a huge unescapable desert to the south.
The villainous team(s) in the game are in no way related to the [[Aztec Empire]] or the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Spanish conquistadors]]. The town the player starts in is covered in snow since the town is located up in the mountains. The player, named either Simon or Sofia by default, has a friendly rival as well as a more acerbic rival who steals the friendly rival's starter Pokémon.&lt;ref name="ibt"/&gt;{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==Development==
The game's development began in 2011, when a group of ''Pokémon'' fans from /vp/, a board on the website [[4chan]] dedicated to ''Pokémon'' discussion, decided to collaborate on a [[fangame]]. Developed for computers running [[Microsoft Windows]], it was created using the software [[RPG Maker]] with the aid of Pokémon Essentials, a set of scripts tailored to ''Pokémon'' gameplay. The development team has sought out help from outside sources, allowing submissions for concept art and in-game sprites.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} The working title was ''CAPX'', which remains the namesake of the game's [[wiki]].&lt;ref name="polygon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/3/12/4093424/4chans-community-is-creating-its-own-pokemon-video-game|publisher=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=March 12, 2013|title=4chan's community is creating its own Pokémon video game|last=Corriea|first=Alexa Ray|accessdate=November 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game's development has been lengthy and marked by internal disagreements; by June 2014, even the villainous team had not yet been chosen from a list of candidates.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;ref name="ibt"/&gt; A demo was released in 2014; it lasts for around two hours of gameplay and includes three towns and two caves, with a limited Pokédex of ten Pokémon.&lt;ref name="ibt"/&gt;

'''Poltpalingada Booboorowie''' (born {{circa|1830}} &amp;ndash; died 4 July 1901) was a [[Ngarrindjeri]] [[Indigenous Australian|Aboriginal]] of the [[Thooree]] clan prominent among the community of [[Fringe dwellers]] in [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]] during the 1890s. He was better known to the Adelaide residents as '''Tommy Walker.''' He was the subject of several portraits by the Adelaide artist [[Oscar Friström]].

==Early life==
Walker was born in the early 19th century on the shores of [[Lake Albert (South Australia)|Lake Albert]] in the upper south-east of South Australia. While young, Walker's father was reportedly killed in a tribal fight with the neighboring [[Kaurna people|Kaurna]] people. He occasionally worked for local settlers and he may have travelled to the [[Victorian gold rush|Victorian goldfields]] in the 1850s.

Walker spent most of his life travelling between the fringe camps inhabited by displaced Aboriginals and, although he spurned white settlements and the restrictions of mission life, frequently visited the Point McLeay Mission ([[Raukkan, South Australia|Raukkan]]) on the banks of [[Lake Alexandrina (South Australia)|Lake Alexandrina]]. Often arrested for drinking offences he was popular in Point McLeay for his wit. One story that became almost legendary regarded his church attendances. Whenever the communion cup was passed to Walker, he would drain it then call out, ''Fill 'im up again''. From the 1870s he was never seen without his companion Mary.

==Adelaide Fame==
In the late 1880s, Walker and Mary joined the Fringe dwellers that lived in the [[Adelaide Park Lands]]. In 1892 Mary died and Ada Niledalli became his companion. Photographs show him as a thick set man with bushy hair, a full white "flour bag" beard and grey felt top hat, wearing a ragged jacket or tail-coat, and barefooted.

A renowned [[Mimicry|mimic]] with a "sharp wit and acid tongue" Walker spoke fluent English and was especially fluent in what the media called "condemnatory passages". His popularity with the public was such that the government gave him a pass for free travel on public transport and the newspapers referred to him as the ''chartered libertine of the metropolis.'' He also had the gift of [[retort]] and it is related that one day he was travelling in a first class rail carriage when a Government Minister said "Hello Tommy, how do you come here?", Walker immediately replied "All the same as bloody member of Parliament, got a free pass."&lt;ref&gt;Free travel for politicians has always been, and remains, a contentious issue with the South Australian public.&lt;/ref&gt;

The local newspapers regularly reported on his movements, activities and his numerous appearances in court, usually on charges of being drunk, using insulting language or begging. Walker's begging was popular with the public as it resembled [[street theatre]] in which he would recount his most recent arrest, parodying the magistrate bringing down his sentence and imposing a fine. As Aboriginals had free access to public gatherings, he frequented [[Australian rules football|football]] and [[cricket]] matches at [[Adelaide Oval]] where he would entertain the crowd with dramatic recreations of his police court appearances, alternatively playing the part of both the magistrate and offender. Walker became a common sight in Adelaide, walking the streets with Ada and his dogs while being followed by dozens of children. He once told a reporter; "It's a funny thing that a gentleman can't walk along the footpath without a crowd of kids after him".

Walker's arrests were so frequent (and reported) that a rhyme about him was popular among school children who generally idolised him:&lt;blockquote&gt;Tommy Walker, walk up here&lt;br /&gt;You are charged with drinking beer&lt;br /&gt;Forty bob you'll have to pay&lt;br /&gt;Or down below you'll have to stay&lt;br /&gt;Ta-ra-ra-ra-boom-de-ay.&lt;/blockquote&gt; Walker saw the song as a compliment and often sang it himself at public gatherings. The fines he accumulated were always paid by public donations or from the proceeds of his begging.

==Death==
It was arranged that on 9 July 1901, the [[Duke of Cornwall]] (the future king [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]]) was to visit Adelaide and by official decree, Adelaide's Aboriginals were "deported" to [[Encounter Bay]], {{convert|100|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} south of Adelaide. Wanting to see the Duke, Walker and several other Aboriginals walked back to Adelaide. Walker was found to be in a "weak and feeble" condition from the effects of the cold weather and was admitted to the [[Royal Adelaide Hospital|Adelaide Hospital]] but slipped away on 28 June and returned to his [[Humpy|wurlie]] in the parklands. He was later returned to the hospital where he died from [[hypothermia]] on 4 July.

The [[Australian Securities Exchange|Adelaide Stock Exchange]] paid for his headstone, and Walker was buried in the [[West Terrace Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article4846133? An Old Identity Gone] ''[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]]'' 5 July 1901&lt;/ref&gt; In 1903 it was discovered that the coroner, Dr. [[William Ramsay Smith]], had removed his skeleton before burial and sent it to the [[University of Edinburgh]] as an "anthropological specimen", making up the missing weight in the coffin with sand. The revelation led to public outrage, and Aborigines began refusing to attend the Adelaide Hospital if sick. Smith was suspended and charges were laid against him for "the misuse of human remains". A [[Public inquiry|board of inquiry]] found that the coroner's actions had been "indiscreet", and he was dismissed from his position as coroner. However, Smith was later reinstated and continued his practice of collecting remains. In the early 1990s, the [[University of Edinburgh]] became the first British institution to repatriate Aboriginal remains, and Walker's bones were ceremoniously buried at Raukkan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://meanjin.com.au/editions/volume-68-number-4-2009/article/the-return-of-the-bones/ The Return of the Bones] ''Meanjin'' quarterly Volume 68, Number 4, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 24, 2003, McLaughlin arrived at school with a loaded [[Colt pistol|Colt]] .22-caliber [[handgun]] with the intention of killing Bartell, whom McLaughlin claimed bullied him over his [[acne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BOY WAS TEASED ABOUT ACNE, NEIGHBORS SAY THEY DESCRIBE HIM AS 'GOOD KID, NO TROUBLE'|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PD&amp;s_site=twincities&amp;p_multi=SP&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0FDDE6BFAECB99A1&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|accessdate=12 July 2013|newspaper=Saint Paul Pioneer Press|date=September 25, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=FATHER: GUN KEPT IN DRESSER MCLAUGHLIN USED PISTOL THAT WAS TO BE HANDED DOWN|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PD&amp;s_site=twincities&amp;p_multi=SP&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=10B6D5702FE58920&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|accessdate=12 July 2013|newspaper=St. Paul Pioneer Press|date=July 12, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; McLaughlin met Bartell and Rollins as they were exiting the school [[locker room]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chalmers|first=Phil|title=Inside the Mind of a Teen Killer|year=2009|publisher=Thomas Nelson|isbn=1595551522|page=89|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WYDQwDvXz9MC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;lpg=PA89&amp;dq=%22Jason+McLaughlin%22+bullying&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WDbkPF6Tiz&amp;sig=DCJBZgxMn_7I-IAyx2hRvmubhR0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=d8LfUa3XNti14APn14HwDw&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Jason%20McLaughlin%22%20bullying&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; He shot at Bartell, hitting him in the chest.

The trial began on July 5, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MCLAUGHLIN'S TRIAL UNDER WAY LAWYERS DIFFER ON CENTRAL QUESTION OF INTENT|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PD&amp;s_site=twincities&amp;p_multi=SP&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=10B5848E47091620&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|accessdate=12 July 2013|newspaper=St. Paul Pioneer Press|date=July 6, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The defense argued that McLaughlin did not plan to kill anyone and that the teen had only intended to scare Bartell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Post|first=Tim|title=Graphic testimony in first day of McLaughlin trial|url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/2005/07/05_postt_mclaughlinday1/|publisher=Minnesota Public Radio|accessdate=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecution argued that the deaths were [[premeditated murder|premeditated]], as McLaughlin had stated to police that he had planned the shooting "several days in advance".&lt;ref name="jaapl"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kapoor|first=Reena|author2=Charles C.

McLaughlin was found guilty of first and second-degree [[murder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Teen convicted of murder in Rocori High School shootings|url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/2005/07/18_postt_rocoriverdict/|publisher=MPR|accessdate=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sentencing==
In August 2005, he was sentenced with two consecutive prison sentences. McLaughlin was sentenced to [[Life imprisonment|life in prison]] for first-degree murder and 12 years in prison for second-degree murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=McLaughlin gets consecutive sentences in Rocori shootings|url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/2005/08/30_postt_rocori/|publisher=mpr|accessdate=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the sentences, McLaughlin's attorneys attempted to have him declared insane at the time of the shootings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sane or not?

==Wrongful death lawsuit==
In September 2006 the families of victims Aaron Rollins and Seth Bartell filed a [[Wrongful death claim|wrongful death lawsuit]] against the McLaughlins, the Rocori school district, and former Rocori High School Principal Doug Standke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Families of Rocori victims are suing|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=MN&amp;p_theme=mn&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=114942C59677D8A8&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|accessdate=12 July 2013|newspaper=Star-Tribune|date=October 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The families alleged that the school district had prior knowledge of the shootings about a week before their occurrence and that they could have prevented its occurrence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Attorney for Rocori school district calls allegations 'baseless'|url=http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2006/10/04/rocorilawsuit|publisher=MPR|accessdate=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuit was initially dismissed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Minn.

'''Roy Chung''' (born '''Chung Ryeu Sup''') is widely believed to be the fifth of six [[United States Army]] soldiers to have defected to [[North Korea]] after the [[Korean War]].

== Life and disappearance ==
Chung and his family were [[South Korea]]n immigrants who arrived in the United States in 1973. According to his father, Chung Soo-oh, he had joined the Army to get education benefits. He disappeared and was reported [[AWOL]] on June 5, 1979 while serving with his unit near [[Bayreuth]], [[West Germany]] (about 30&amp;nbsp;miles (48&amp;nbsp;kilometers) from the borders of [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[East Germany]]). After 30 days he became classified as a [[desertion|deserter]]. He was 22 and a [[Private First Class]].&lt;ref name="wapo"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1979/09/13/south-korean-who-joined-us-army-reportedly-defected-to-north-korea/80252b5b-2179-4613-a3a9-6fc8d3eebbae/ "South Korean, Who Joined U.S. Army, Reportedly Defected to North Korea"], ''The Washington Post''. September 13, 1979. Joe Ritchie and Jaehoon Ahn. A28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two months after his disappearance in Europe, North Korea's international broadcasting service ''Radio Pyongyang'' (now ''[[Voice of Korea]]'') announced his defection, stating that he "could no longer endure the disgraceful life of national insult and maltreatment he had to lead in the U.S. imperialist aggressor Army."&lt;ref name="wapo"/&gt;

The other five men who disappeared into North Korea did so by directly crossing the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]].

In 2004, filmmaker [[Nicholas Bonner]] (co-creator of the documentary ''[[Crossing the Line (documentary)|Crossing the Line]]'') reported that he heard Chung had died of natural causes.

=== Claims of Abduction ===

Officials of the [[United States Department of State]] and [[the Pentagon]] at the time stated that they had no reason to doubt North Korea's claims of defection. They made no major inquiries into the matter because Chung had no access to classified information and was not a security threat. 

Chung's family and [[Korean-American]] groups strongly believed that he had been abducted and was not a [[defector]], as widely believed. They compared his disappearance to several documented abductions by North Korean agents, most notably the kidnap of [[actress]] [[Choi Eun-hee]].&lt;ref name="wapo"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1945">'''Semira Adamu''' (1978–1998) was a 20-year-old [[refugee|asylum seeker]] from [[Nigeria]] who was [[asphyxia|suffocated]] to death with a pillow by two Belgian police officers&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org.uk/press-releases/belgium-semira-adamus-case-opportunity-further-review-expulsion-procedures Amnesty International Report on the Semira Adamu case]&lt;/ref&gt; who tried to calm her during their [[deportation|expulsion]] effort. She first fled Nigeria because of a [[forced marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3097188.stm Belgian police tried over asylum death]&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 12th, 2003, four police were held responsible for this incident in the trial that followed. The Belgian state was ordered to pay compensation to the relatives. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statewatch.org/news/2003/dec/09semira-adamu.htm Four Belgian police officers guilty over the death of Semira Adamu]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irr.org.uk/cgi-bin/news/open.pl?id=5907 Four police officers convicted] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927234402/https://www.irr.org.uk/cgi-bin/news/open.pl?id=5907 |date=2011-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adamu's death sparked a huge debate in [[Belgium]] and led to the [[Etienne Vermeersch]] report on the practice of expulsion.

As a result of the [[one-child policy]], the number of shidu parents is expected to increase in China over the coming years.&lt;ref name=liholid&gt;{{cite web|last=Li|first=Grace|title=China's lonely parents tell of loss of only children as family holiday nears|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/12/27/us-china-parents-idUKBRE9BQ01V20131227| publisher=Reuters|date=27 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=baoforcelos&gt;{{cite web|last=Bao|first=Beibei|title=Shidu: When Chinese Parents Forced to Have One Child Lose That Child|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/china/archive/2013/05/shidu-when-chinese-parents-forced-to-have-one-child-lose-that-child/275691/| publisher=The Atlantic|date=9 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to official figures, there have been at least one million families who lost their only child since the implementation of the one-child policy to the end of 2010 and it is expected to rise with 76,000 per year.&lt;ref name=urgehelp/&gt;&lt;ref name=sc-legac&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fan|first1=Liya|title=China’s one-child policy leaves bereaved parents in despair|url=http://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/long-reads/article/2107155/chinas-one-child-policy-has-legacy-bereaved|publisher=South China Morning Post|date=19 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a society where parents rely on their children for looking after them in old age, this phenomenon may have devastating effects to many shidu parents.&lt;ref name=phys-ment-18/&gt;&lt;ref name=liholid/&gt;&lt;ref name=baoforcelos/&gt; Many shidu parents suffer from psychological problems and financial difficulties after losing their only child.&lt;ref name=phil-mala/&gt; In 2013, the China National Committee on Ageing reported that between 70 to 80 percent of shidu parents have suffered psychological trauma, in which half of these people are also experiencing depression.&lt;ref name=sc-legac/&gt;

Comparing bereaved parents and nonbereaved parents, it is observed that bereaved parents are significantly more vulnerable in physical well-being (in terms of chronic diseases and health status self-assessment) and psychological well-being (in terms of depression and satisfaction with life).&lt;ref name=wejigi/&gt; Furthermore, bereaved parents tend to have less social support (in terms of practical support, emotional support, and social interaction).&lt;ref name=wejigi/&gt; This is consistent with the reported social isolation of these parents, driven by both withdrawal and exclusion from society.&lt;ref name=wejigi/&gt; Looking at the characteristics of bereaved parents, it's been observed that parents of a younger age, lower education level, and lower income level, and with chronic diseases are significantly more vulnerable in terms of well-being.&lt;ref name=wejigi/&gt;

Investigating shidu in mainland China, with reduced family members due to population control, there are indications that the death of a loved one has become more devastating and traumatic for other family members as well.&lt;ref name=phys-ment-18&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yin |first1=Qianlan |last2=Shang |first2=Zhilei |last3=Zhou |first3=Na |last4=Wu |first4=Lili |last5=Liu |first5=Guangyu |last6=Yu |first6=Xiaoqian |last7=Zhang |first7=Huaihui |last8=Xue |first8=Haidong |last9=Liu |first9=Weizhi |title=An investigation of physical and mental health consequences among Chinese parents who lost their only child |journal=BMC Psychiatry |date=12 February 2018 |volume=18 |issue=1 |doi=10.1186/s12888-018-1621-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigating shidu parents (with parents of a living child as control) in the Yangpu district of Shanghai, research show that shidu parents have an increased vulnerability for PTSD, depressive symptoms, and mental illness symptoms.&lt;ref name=phys-ment-18/&gt; Compared to males, females were especially susceptible to develop PTSD.&lt;ref name=phys-ment-18/&gt; In shidu parents, a significantly higher overall morbidity of coronary heart disease, tumors, mental diseases, and other unclassified diseases was also observed.&lt;ref name=phys-ment-18/&gt; Shidu parents also had more visits to the hospital.&lt;ref name=phys-ment-18/&gt;

==Government policies==
===Programs===
In 2002, the [[National People's Congress]] put into law that local governments must "provide necessary assistance" to shidu parents if they do not adopt or give birth to another child.&lt;ref name=baoforcelos/&gt; In 2007, the central government set a monthly compensation of minimum $16 per parent in ten provinces and cities.&lt;ref name=baoforcelos/&gt; On 31 August 2007, [[National Population and Family Planning Commission]] (NPFPC) and the [[Ministry of Finance of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Finance]] stated that the national compensation level is 100 yuan or above per person per month.&lt;ref name=wejigi/&gt; Since a 2012 policy, families were entitled to a monthly compensation of minimum 135 yuan ($22) per parent.&lt;ref name=liholid/&gt; On 26 December 2013, the NHFPC increased the monthly compensation to a minimum of 340 yuan ($56) per parent for urban households and to a minimum of 170 yuan ($28) per parent for rural households,&lt;ref name=liholid/&gt;&lt;ref name=wejigi/&gt; applicable if the woman is at least 49 years old.&lt;ref name=liholid/&gt; The actual amount of compensation may increase depending on provincial and local policies.&lt;ref name=baoforcelos/&gt;&lt;ref name=liholid/&gt;&lt;ref name=wejigi/&gt;

===Criticism===
The governmental financial assistance has been characterized as relatively low.&lt;ref name=wejigi/&gt; Furthermore, the program's strict focus on providing structural support (such as cash allowances and prioritized access to nursing homes) has been criticized, because it heavily lacks on issues that goes beyond structural support (such as psychological well-being and social support).&lt;ref name=wejigi/&gt; Secondly, the structural interventions itself are considered inadequate, because there's a strong emphasis attached to [[filial piety|filial obligation]] in old-age security and well-being in Chinese society, and nursing homes are inadequate in coverage and quality.&lt;ref name=wejigi/&gt;

Professor Qiao Xiaochun (of the Population Research Centre at [[Peking University]] and former consultant for the Family Planning Committee) states that government assistance remains very poor, as the government did not fully expect all the possible consequences of the [[one-child policy]] at the very beginning, such as the problems associated with shidu parents.&lt;ref name=sc-legac/&gt; He also notes that the psychological issues are more pressing than poverty for most shidu parents.&lt;ref name=sc-legac/&gt;

==Public perception==
Notable people, such as Nobel laureate [[Mo Yan]], have spoken out for more support to those who have lost their only child.&lt;ref name=urgehelp&gt;{{cite web| title=Mo Yan urges to help bereaved one-child parents| url=http://china.org.cn/china/NPC_CPPCC_2014/2014-03/07/content_31706736.htm| publisher=China.org.cn| date=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 June 2012, around 80 ''shidu fumu'' (on behalf of 2000 ''shidu fumu'' who had signed a petition) assembled at the NPFPC and proposed the provision of economic compensation for their loss, the establishment of ''shidu fumu''-oriented communities with low rent, and the designation of a department where ''shidu fumu'' can turn to for help when needed.&lt;ref name=wejigi/&gt; There was no formal reply for almost two years.&lt;ref name=wejigi/&gt; On 21 April 2014, over 240 ''shidu fumu'' assembled at the [[National Health and Family Planning Commission]] (NHFPC; having superseded the NPFPC in 2013) for an official discussion.&lt;ref name=wejigi/&gt; Even though the NHFPC acknowledged their contributions to the family planning policies, they refused their request as they stated that there is no legal basis to support their requirement for administrative compensation.&lt;ref name=wejigi/&gt;

Incidents like the [[2008 Sichuan earthquake]],&lt;ref name=mor-reach/&gt; [[Boston Marathon bombings]]&lt;ref name=mor-reach&gt;{{cite web|last1=Morison| first1=Katie| title=Grieving Chinese reach out after their 1 allowed child dies| url=http://news.msn.com/world/grieving-chinese-reach-out-after-their-1-allowed-child-dies| publisher=MSN News| date=2 May 2013 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130503071558/http://news.msn.com/world/grieving-chinese-reach-out-after-their-1-allowed-child-dies | archive-date=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 370]] disappearance&lt;ref name=phil-mala&gt;{{cite web| last1=Phillips| first1=Tom| title=Malaysia Airlines missing flight exposes tragedy of China’s ‘orphaned’ one-child parents| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/10721983/Malaysia-Airlines-missing-flight-exposes-tragedy-of-Chinas-orphaned-one-child-parents.html| publisher=The Telegraph| date=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; have highlighted the tremendous impact that this phenomenon has.

In May 2010, the 60-year-old shidu parent Sheng Hailin became China's oldest person to give birth, namely to twin girls through IVF.&lt;ref name=liqdesjo/&gt;

'''Social security''' is "any government system that provides monetary assistance to people with an inadequate or no income."&lt;ref name="Bach2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Bach|title=1001 Financial Words You Need to Know|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a5R44srUbsUC&amp;pg=PA185&amp;dq=%22social%20security%22|date=9 October 2003|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=978-0-19-517050-4|page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, this is usually called '''welfare''' or a [[social safety net]], especially when talking about Canada and European countries.

Social security is asserted in Article 22 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], which states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Everyone, as a member of society, has the right to social security and is entitled to realization, through national effort and international co-operation and in accordance with the organization and resources of each State, of the [[economic, social and cultural rights]] indispensable for his [[human dignity|dignity]] and the free development of his personality.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In simple terms, the signatories agree that the society in which a person lives should help them to develop and to make the most of all the advantages (culture, work, [[social welfare]]) which are offered to them in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Universal Declaration of Human Rights|url=https://www.un.org/cyberschoolbus/humanrights/resources/plain.asp|work=Plain language version|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=20 April 2012|quote=Art 22. "22 The society in which you live should help you to develop and to make the most of all the advantages (culture, work, social welfare) which are offered to you and to all the men and women in your country."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social security may also refer to the action programs of an organization intended to promote the welfare of the population through assistance measures guaranteeing access to sufficient resources for food and shelter and to promote health and well-being for the population at large and potentially vulnerable segments such as children, the elderly, the sick and the unemployed. Services providing social security are often called '''[[social services]]'''.

Terminology in this area is somewhat different in the [[United States]] from in the rest of the English-speaking world. The general term for an action program in support of the well being of poor people in the United States is ''welfare program'', and the general term for all such programs is simply ''welfare''. In American society, the term ''welfare'' arguably has negative connotations. In the United States, the term ''Social Security'' refers to the [[Social Security (United States)|US social insurance program]] for all retired and disabled people. Elsewhere the term is used in a much broader sense, referring to the economic security society offers when people are faced with certain risks. In its 1952 [[Social Security (Minimum Standards) Convention, 1952|Social Security (Minimum Standards) Convention (nr. 102)]], the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) defined the traditional contingencies covered by social security as including:

*  Survival beyond a prescribed age, to be covered by ''[[old age pension]]s'';
*  The loss of support suffered by a widowed person or child as the result of the death of the breadwinner (''survivor’s benefit'');
*  Responsibility for the maintenance of children (''family benefit'');
*  The treatment of any morbid condition (including pregnancy), whatever its cause (''medical care'');
*  A suspension of earnings due to pregnancy and confinement and their consequences (''maternity benefit'');
*  A suspension of earnings due to an inability to obtain suitable employment for protected persons who are capable of, and available for, work (''[[unemployment benefits]]'');
*  A suspension of earnings due to an incapacity for work resulting from a morbid condition (''sickness leave benefit'');
*  A permanent or persistent inability to engage in any gainful activity (''[[disability benefits]]'');
*  The costs and losses involved in medical care, sickness leave, invalidity and death of the breadwinner due to an occupational accident or disease (''employment injuries'').

People who cannot reach a guaranteed [[minimum wage|social minimum]] for other reasons may be eligible for ''social assistance'' (or [[welfare]], in American English).

Modern authors often consider the ILO approach too narrow. In their view, social security is not limited to the provision of cash transfers, but also aims at security of work, health, and social participation; and new social risks (single parenthood, the reconciliation of work and family life) should be included in the list as well.&lt;ref&gt;See for a more elaborate discussion: {{cite book|author=J.C. Vrooman|title=Rules of Relief; Institutions of Social Security, and Their Impact|url=http://www.transactionpub.com/title/Rules-of-Relief-978-90-377-0218-7.html|year=2009|publisher=[[Transaction Publishers]] (The Netherlands Institute for Social Research)|pages=111–126}} {{ISBN|978-90-377-0218-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social security may refer to:
*  '''[[social insurance]]''', where people receive benefits or services in recognition of contributions to an insurance program. These services typically include provision for retirement [[pensions]], [[disability insurance]], survivor benefits and [[unemployment insurance]].
*  '''services''' provided by government or designated agencies responsible for social security provision. In different countries, that may include medical care, financial support during unemployment, sickness, or retirement, health and safety at work, aspects of social work and even industrial relations.
*  '''basic security''' irrespective of participation in specific insurance programs where eligibility may otherwise be an issue. For instance, assistance given to newly arrived refugees for basic necessities such as [[food]], [[clothing]], [[Home|housing]], [[education]], [[money]], and [[medicine|medical care]].

A report published by the ILO in 2014 estimated that only 27% of the world's population has access to comprehensive social security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/newsroom/news/WCMS_244748/lang--en/index.htm|title=More than 70 per cent of the world population lacks proper social protection|author=|date=3 June 2014|website=ilo.org|accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

While several of the provisions to which the concept refers have a long history (especially in poor relief), the notion of "social security" itself is a fairly recent one. The earliest examples of use date from the 19th century. In a speech to mark the independence of [[Venezuela]], [[Simón Bolívar]] (1819) pronounced: "El sistema de gobierno más perfecto es aquel que produce mayor suma de felicidad posible, mayor suma de ''seguridad social'' y mayor suma de estabilidad política"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.correodelorinoco.gob.ve/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/EE_CO523.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130901103013/http://www.correodelorinoco.gob.ve/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/EE_CO523.pdf |archivedate=1 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; (which translates to "The most perfect system of government is that which produces the greatest amount of happiness, the greatest amount of social security and the greatest amount of political stability").

In the [[Roman Empire]], the Emperor [[Trajan]] (reigned A.D. 98–117) distributed gifts of money and free [[grain]] to the poor in the city of Rome, and returned the gifts of gold sent to him upon his accession by cities in Italy and the provinces of the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/602150/Trajan#tab=active~checked%2Citems~checked&amp;title=Trajan%20--%20Britannica%20Online%20Encyclopædia Britannica.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Trajan's program brought acclaim from many, including [[Pliny the Younger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/empires/romans/empire/nerva_trajan.html|title=The Roman Empire: in the First Century.

In Jewish tradition, charity (represented by [[tzedakah]]) is a matter of religious obligation rather than benevolence. Contemporary charity is regarded as a continuation of the [[Bible|Biblical]] [[Maaser Ani]], or poor-[[tithe]], as well as Biblical practices, such as permitting the poor to glean the corners of a field and harvest during the [[Shmita]] (Sabbatical year). Voluntary charity, along with [[prayer]] and [[repentance]], is befriended to ameliorate the consequences of bad acts.

The Song dynasty (c.1000 AD) government supported multiple forms of social assistance programs, including the establishment of retirement homes, public clinics, and pauper's graveyards.&lt;ref&gt;[[Song dynasty]]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to economist [[Robert Nelson (economist)|Robert Henry Nelson]], "The [[medieval]] [[Roman Catholic Church]] operated a far-reaching and comprehensive welfare system for the poor..."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Henry Nelson (2001). "''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Rw-bHEGNqqcC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Economics as religion: from Samuelson to Chicago and beyond]''".

The concepts of welfare and [[pension]] were put into practice in the early [[Sharia|Islamic law]]&lt;ref name=Crone/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=August 2010}} of the [[Caliphate]] as forms of ''[[Zakat]]'' (charity), one of the [[Five Pillars of Islam]], since the time of the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun caliph]] [[Umar]] in the 7th century. The [[tax]]es (including ''Zakat'' and ''[[Jizya]]'') collected in the [[treasury]] of an Islamic government were used to provide [[income]] for the needy, including the [[Poverty|poor]], [[Old age|elderly]], [[orphan]]s, [[widow]]ed persons, and the disabled. According to the Islamic jurist [[Al-Ghazali]] (Algazel, 1058–1111), the government was also expected to store up food supplies in every region in case a [[disaster]] or [[famine]] occurred.&lt;ref name=Crone&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6u13vgHhSdgC&amp;pg=PA308&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=''Medieval Islamic Political Thought''|first=Patricia|last=Crone|publisher=[[Edinburgh University Press]]|year=2005|isbn=0-7486-2194-6|pages=308–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hamid&gt;{{Cite journal|title=An Islamic Alternative?

There is relatively little [[statistic]]al data on [[transfer payment]]s before the [[High Middle Ages]]. In the [[medieval]] period and until the [[Industrial Revolution]], the function of welfare payments in [[Europe]] was principally achieved through private giving or [[Charity (practice)|charity]]. In those early times, there was a much broader group considered to be in poverty as compared to the 21st century.

Early welfare programs in Europe included the [[England|English]] [[Poor Law]] of 1601, which gave [[parish]]es the responsibility for providing poverty relief assistance to the poor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/boyer.poor.laws.england The Poor Laws of England] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105105148/http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/boyer.poor.laws.england |date=5 January 2010 }} at EH.Net&lt;/ref&gt; This system was substantially modified by the 19th-century [[Poor Law Amendment Act]], which introduced the system of [[workhouse]]s.

It was predominantly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that an organized system of state welfare provision was introduced in many countries. [[Otto von Bismarck]], [[Chancellor of the German Empire|Chancellor]] of Germany, introduced one of the first welfare systems for the [[working class]]es in 1883. In [[Great Britain]] the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] government of [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman]] and [[David Lloyd George]] introduced the [[National Insurance]] system in 1911,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/history/mwh/britain/liberalreformsrev2.shtml Liberal Reforms] at [[BBC]] Bitesize&lt;/ref&gt; a system later expanded by [[Clement Attlee]]. The United States did not have an organized welfare system until the [[Great Depression]], when emergency relief measures were introduced under [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. Even then, Roosevelt's [[New Deal]] focused predominantly on a program of providing work and stimulating the economy through [[public spending]] on projects, rather than on cash payment.

== Income maintenance ==
{{Main|Unemployment benefits}}
This policy is usually applied through various programs designed to provide a population with income at times when they are unable to care for themselves. Income maintenance is based in a combination of five main types of program:
*  '''Social insurance''', considered above
*  '''Means-tested''' benefits, financial assistance provided for those who are unable to cover basic needs, such as food, clothing and housing, due to [[poverty]] or lack of income because of unemployment, sickness, disability, or caring for children. While assistance is often in the form of financial payments, those eligible for social welfare can usually access health and educational services free of charge. The amount of support is enough to cover basic needs and eligibility is often subject to a comprehensive and complex assessment of an applicant's social and financial situation. See also [[Income Support]].
*  '''Non-contributory''' benefits. Several countries have special schemes, administered with no requirement for contributions and no means test, for people in certain categories of need: for example, veterans of armed forces, people with disabilities and very old people.
*  '''Discretionary''' benefits. Some schemes are based on the discretion of an official, such as a social worker.
*  '''Universal''' or categorical benefits, also known as '''demogrants'''. These are non-contributory benefits given for whole sections of the population without a means test, such as family allowances or the public pension in New Zealand (known as New Zealand Superannuation). See also, [[Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend]].

== Social protection ==
{{main|Social protection}}
Social protection refers to a set of benefits available (or not available) from the state, market, civil society and households, or through a combination of these agencies, to the individual/households to reduce multi-dimensional deprivation. This multi-dimensional deprivation could be affecting less active poor persons (such as the elderly or the disabled) and active [[Poverty|poor]] persons (such as the unemployed).

This broad framework makes this concept more acceptable in developing countries than the concept of social security. Social security is more applicable in the conditions, where large numbers of citizens depend on the formal economy for their livelihood. Through a defined contribution, this social security may be managed.

But, in the context of widespread informal economy, formal social security arrangements are almost absent for the vast majority of the working population. Besides, in developing countries, the state's capacity to reach the vast majority of the poor people may be limited because of its limited infrastructure and resources. In such a context, multiple agencies that could provide for social protection, including health care, is critical for policy consideration.&lt;ref&gt;Mendoza, Roger Lee (1990).  The political economy of population control and retirement security in China, India and the Philippines.  ''Philippine Economic Review'', 31(2): 174–191.&lt;/ref&gt; The framework of social protection is thus holds the state responsible for providing for the poorest populations by regulating non-state agencies.

Collaborative research from the [[Institute of Development Studies]] debating Social Protection from a global perspective, suggests that advocates for social protection fall into two broad categories: "instrumentalists" and "activists". Instrumentalists argue that [[extreme poverty]], [[economic inequality|inequality]], and [[social vulnerability|vulnerability]] is dysfunctional in the achievement of development targets (such as the MDGs). In this view, social protection is about putting in place risk management mechanisms that will compensate for incomplete or missing insurance (and other) markets, until a time that private insurance can play a more prominent role in that society. Activist arguments view the persistence of extreme poverty, inequality, and vulnerability as symptoms of [[social injustice]] and [[Structural Inequality|structural inequality]] and see social protection as a right of citizenship. Targeted welfare is a necessary step between humanitarianism and the ideal of a "[[guaranteed minimum income]]" where entitlement extends beyond cash or food transfers and is based on citizenship, not philanthropy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ntd.co.uk/idsbookshop/details.asp?id=987 'Debating Social Protection'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724102136/http://www.ntd.co.uk/idsbookshop/details.asp?id=987 |date=24 July 2011 }} Devereux, S and Sabates-Wheeler, R.

'''Space adaptation syndrome''' ('''SAS''') or '''space sickness''' is a condition experienced by as many as half of all [[space traveler]]s during their adaptation to [[weightlessness]] once in orbit .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Tony | last = Quine |  title = Addicted to space: An appreciation of Anousheh Ansari, Part II | journal = Spaceflight | issn = 0038-6340 | volume = 49 |date=April 2007 | pages = 144 | issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the opposite of terrestrial [[motion sickness]] since it occurs when the environment and the person appear visually to be in motion relative to one another even though there is no corresponding sensation of bodily movement originating from the [[vestibular system]].&lt;ref name="sciencedaily"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/05/080521112119.htm | title = Why Do Astronauts Suffer From Space Sickness? | publisher = ScienceDaily | date = 2008-05-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cause and remedy ==
When the vestibular system and the [[visual system]] report incongruous states of motion, the result is often [[nausea]] and other symptoms of [[disorientation]] known as [[motion sickness]]. According to contemporary sensory conflict theory, such conditions happen when the vestibular system and the visual system do not present a synchronized and unified representation of one's body and surroundings. (This theory is also known as neural mismatch, implying a mismatch occurring between ongoing sensory experience and long-term memory rather than between components of the vestibular and visual systems, emphasizing "the limbic system in integration of sensory information and long-term memory, in the expression of the symptoms of motion sickness, and the impact of anti-motion-sickness drugs and stress hormones on limbic system function. The limbic system may be the neural mismatch center of the brain."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |pmc = 4112051|year = 2014|last1 = Lackner|first1 = J. R.|title = Motion sickness: More than nausea and vomiting|journal = Experimental Brain Research|volume = 232|issue = 8|pages = 2493–2510|pmid = 24961738|doi = 10.1007/s00221-014-4008-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At present a "fully adequate theory of motion sickness is not presently available" but at present the sensory conflict theory, referring to "a discontinuity between either visual, proprioceptive, and somatosensory input, or semicircular canal and otolith input", may be the best available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |pmid = 6870740|year = 1983|last1 = Kohl|first1 = R. L.|title = Sensory conflict theory of space motion sickness: An anatomical location for the neuroconflict|journal = Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine|volume = 54|issue = 5|pages = 464–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Space adaptation syndrome or space sickness is a kind of motion sickness that can occur when one's surroundings visually appear to be in motion, but without a corresponding sense of bodily motion. This incongruous condition can occur during [[Human spaceflight|space travel]] when changes in [[g-force]]s compromise one's [[spatial orientation]].&lt;ref name="sciencedaily" /&gt; According to ''[[Science Daily]]'', "[[Gravity]] plays a major role in our spatial orientation. Changes in gravitational forces, such as the transition to weightlessness during a space voyage, influence our spatial orientation and require adaptation by many of the physiological processes in which our balance system plays a part. As long as this adaptation is incomplete, this can be coupled to nausea, visual illusions, and disorientation."&lt;ref name="sciencedaily" /&gt; [[Sleep deprivation]] can also increase susceptibility to space sickness, making symptoms worse and longer-lasting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |pmc = 4112051|year = 2014|last1 = Lackner|first1 = J. R.|title = Motion sickness: More than nausea and vomiting|journal = Experimental Brain Research|volume = 232|issue = 8|pages = 2493–2510|pmid = 24961738|doi = 10.1007/s00221-014-4008-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the sensory conflict hypothesis, space sickness is the opposite of the kinds of motion-related disorientation that occur in the presence of gravity, known as terrestrial motion sickness, such as becoming carsick, seasick, or airsick. In such cases, and in contrast to space sickness, one's surroundings seem visually immobile (such as inside a car or airplane or a cabin below decks) while one's body feels itself to be in motion. Contemporary motion sickness medications can counter all kinds of motion disorientation including space sickness by temporarily suppressing the vestibular system, but are rarely used for space travel because it is considered better to allow space travelers to adapt naturally over the first one to seven days rather than to suffer the drowsiness and other side effects of medication taken over a longer period. However, [[Transdermal patch|transdermal]] [[dimenhydrinate]] anti-nausea patches are typically used whenever [[space suits]] are worn because vomiting into a space suit could be fatal by obscuring vision or blocking airflow.  Space suits are generally worn during launch and landing by NASA crew members and always for [[extra-vehicular activities]] (EVAs).  EVAs are consequently not usually scheduled for the first days of a mission to allow the crew to adapt, and transdermal dimenhydrinate patches are typically used as an additional backup measure.

Just as space sickness has the opposite cause compared to terrestrial motion sickness, the two conditions have opposite non-medicinal remedies. The idea of sensory conflict implies that the most direct remedy for motion sickness in general is to resolve the conflict by re-synchronizing what one sees and what one feels. For most (but not all) kinds of terrestrial motion sickness, that can be achieved by viewing one's surroundings from a window or (in the case of seasickness) going up on deck to observe the seas. For space sickness, relief is available via the opposite move of restricting one's vision to a small area such as a book or a small screen, disregarding the overall surroundings until the adaptation process is complete, or simply to close one's eyes until the nauseated feeling is reduced in intensity during the adjustment period. Some research indicates that blindness itself does not provide relief; "Motion sickness can occur during exposure to physical motion, visual motion, and virtual motion, and only those without a functioning vestibular system are fully immune.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |pmc = 4112051|year = 2014|last1 = Lackner|first1 = J. R.|title = Motion sickness: More than nausea and vomiting|journal = Experimental Brain Research|volume = 232|issue = 8|pages = 2493–2510|pmid = 24961738|doi = 10.1007/s00221-014-4008-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== History ==

In August 1961, Soviet Cosmonaut [[Gherman Titov]] became the first human to experience [[space sickness]] on Vostok II; he holds the record for being the first person to vomit in space.&lt;ref name="Guinness2012"&gt;{{cite book |title=Guinness World Records 2013 |publisher=Guinness World Records |editor-first=Craig |editor-last=Glenday |page=27 |date=2012 |isbn=9781904994879}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from that record, space motion sickness was effectively unknown during the earliest spaceflights (Mercury, Gemini series) probably because these missions were undertaken in spacecraft providing very cramped conditions and permitting very little room for head movements; space sickness seems to be aggravated by being able to freely move around, especially in regard to head movement, and so is more common in larger spacecraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Effects of Long-Duration Space Flight on Eye, Head, and Trunk Coordination During Locomotion|url=http://lsda.jsc.nasa.gov/scripts/experiment/exper.cfm?exp_index=747|author=Kozlovskaya, Inessa B.|publisher=NASA Johnson Space Center|year=2004|accessdate=2008-02-07|display-authors=etal|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207204112/http://lsda.jsc.nasa.gov/scripts/experiment/exper.cfm?exp_index=747|archivedate=2012-02-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the ''[[Apollo 8]]'' and ''[[Apollo 9]]'' flights, where astronauts reported space motion sickness to Mission Control and then were subsequently removed from the flight list,{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} astronauts (e.g. the [[Skylab 4#Mission highlights|Skylab 4]] crew) attempted to prevent Mission Control from learning about their own SAS experience, apparently out of concern for their future flight assignment potential.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

As with sea sickness and car sickness, space motion sickness symptoms can vary from mild nausea and disorientation to vomiting and intense discomfort; headaches and nausea are often reported in varying degrees. The most extreme reaction yet recorded was that felt by Senator [[Jake Garn]] in 1985. After his flight, NASA jokingly began using the informal "Garn scale" to measure reactions to space sickness. In most cases, symptoms last from 2–4 days. In an interview with Carol Butler, when asked about the origins of "Garn", Robert E. Stevenson was quoted as saying:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/oral_histories/StevensonRE/RES_5-13-99.pdf|title=Interview with Dr. Robert Stevenson|format=[[PDF]]|page=35|publisher=[[Johnson Space Center Oral History Project]]|date=May 13, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Quote|Jake Garn was sick, was pretty sick.  I don't know whether we should tell stories like that. But anyway, Jake Garn, he has made a mark in the Astronaut Corps because he represents the maximum level of space sickness that anyone can ever attain, and so the mark of being totally sick and totally incompetent is one Garn.  Most guys will get maybe to a tenth Garn if that high.  And within the Astronaut Corps, he forever will be remembered by that.|Robert E. Stevenson}}

'''Steve Austin''' is a [[science fiction film|science fiction]] character created by [[Martin Caidin]] for his 1972 novel, ''[[Cyborg (novel)|Cyborg]]''. The lead character, Colonel Steve Austin, became an iconic 1970s television [[science fiction film|science fiction]] action hero, portrayed by [[United States|American]] actor [[Lee Majors]], in [[United States|American]] television series ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]'', which aired on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC network]] as a regular series for five seasons from 1974 to 1978. In the television series, Steve Austin takes on special high-risk government missions using his superhuman [[Bionics|bionic]] powers. The television character Steve Austin became a [[popular culture|pop culture]] [[pop icon|icon]] of the 1970s.
 
''The Six Million Dollar Man'' television series had as its original working title during pre-production the [[Martin Caidin]] novel ''[[Cyborg (novel)|Cyborg]]'' title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The TV Guide TV Book: 40 Years of the All-Time Greatest Television Facts, Fads, Hits, and History |last=Weiner |first=Ed |author2=Editors of TV Guide |year=1992 |publisher=Harper Collins |location=New York |isbn=0-06-096914-8 |page=174 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caidin's version of Steve Austin appeared in only four original novels unrelated to the television series continuity: ''[[Cyborg (novel)|Cyborg]]'', ''[[Operation Nuke]]'', ''[[High Crystal]]'', and ''[[Cyborg IV]]''.

Following ''The Six Million Dollar Man'' television series, [[Lee Majors]] reprised the role of Colonel Steve Austin in several bionic-themed reunion television movies in the late 1980s and 1990s.

==Background==
As originally conceived by Caidin, Austin is a former [[United States Army|US Army]] [[helicopter]] pilot who served in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] before being transferred to the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] and then into [[NASA]]. As backup [[Lunar Module]] Pilot for [[Apollo 17]],{{ref|app}} he became one of [[List of spacewalks and moonwalks|twelve astronauts]] to [[Extra-vehicular activity|walk on the moon]] when the prime Lunar Module Pilot (LMP) broke an arm before launch.{{ref|lmp}}

In the pilot episode of ''The Six Million Dollar Man'', Austin's background is adjusted: he is a civilian test pilot who was the only civilian to walk on the Moon. In the regular series, however, Austin once again became a military man, holding the rank of [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] in the Air Force. In the episode "Pilot Error" Austin is shown to be wearing both the [[Vietnam Service Medal]] and the [[Vietnam Campaign Medal#United States|Vietnam Campaign Medal]] on his dress uniform, implying that he is a Vietnam veteran.

In both versions of his origin, Austin is testing an experimental [[lifting body]] aircraft{{ref|lift}} when a malfunction causes a crash. Austin's injuries are severe: both legs and one arm are lost, and he is also blinded in one eye and his skull is fractured (the TV version does not suffer the skull injury). One of Austin's best friends is Dr. Rudy Wells, a doctor and scientist who is a specialist in the newly emerging field of [[bionics]]; unknown to Wells, a secret American government intelligence agency, the Office of Strategic Operations (OSO; later changed to Office of Scientific Intelligence or OSI for TV) has been looking at a way of reducing agent casualties. Their solution is to take a severely injured man, rebuild him with bionics, and create a [[cyborg]]—part man, part machine. Wells is ordered to perform the procedure on Austin, who expresses a desire to commit suicide after learning about the loss of his limbs.

==As cyborg==
The operation to rebuild him costs $6 million ($36 million in 2018 dollars). Bionics are used to replace Austin's arm (his left in Caidin's original story; his right in the TV version) and both legs. Austin's eye is also replaced. Caidin and the TV series treat this differently; Caidin's Austin receives a sophisticated miniature camera (activated by pressing a hidden shutter implanted under Austin's skin after which the eye has to be removed before development of the film) but otherwise remains blinded in that eye, while the television version not only restores sight but also has extreme telescopic magnification and [[thermographic camera|infrared]] capabilities. His legs and arm provide Austin with superhuman speed, strength, and endurance (the latter because, Caidin writes, Austin's heart and lungs only need to power his torso, head and remaining arm). Caidin's character also had some additional bionic parts his TV counterpart lacked, such as a steel-reinforced skull, a poison dart gun built into one of his bionic fingers, and a radio transmitter built into a rib.

Another big distinction between Caidin's original and his television counterpart is the extent to which the bionics could supply strength and speed.  In the former, Austin's strength and speed were limited by the physical abilities of the connecting human parts.  For instance, Austin could run faster than the best Olympic athlete, whereas the TV character could run 60 MPH.  Caidin himself satirized the TV series' unrealistic science in another novel, ''ManFac.''

Both versions of the character are subsequently recruited into the OSO/OSI as a [[secret agent]] (and as an ongoing test subject for bionics). Austin becomes a top agent, traveling the world to fight everything from terrorism (the most common target of the literary version of the character) to even alien invasion on television. Austin is obscure enough to usually maintain his anonymity, and uses his astronaut status to establish credibility when necessary.

Austin's personality was altered in the TV series. In the books, Austin was capable of being cold-blooded and did not hesitate to use his powers to kill if necessary. Yet in the TV pilot, Austin is initially hesitant to work for the OSI because, he says, "I don't want to kill people," although he appears to do just that in the subsequent mission. After the show's first season, however, Austin was usually not shown killing anyone.

In Caidin's novels, Austin's superior is OSO chief [[Oscar Goldman]]. Goldman was replaced by another character, Oliver Spencer, in the TV pilot film, but appeared in the regular series. The relationship between the TV version of Austin and Oscar was much friendlier than the literary counterpart, although numerous episodes show Austin being frustrated at being a "bionic lap dog" for the OSI.

==Backstory==
Austin's backstory is barely described by Caidin. The TV series, however, introduced his mother and stepfather (who live in [[Ojai, California]]), and eventually, a fiancée, [[Jaime Sommers (The Bionic Woman)|Jaime Sommers]], who later became bionic after a [[skydiving]] accident, leading to a spin-off series, ''[[The Bionic Woman]]''. Lee Majors made frequent guest appearances on the spin-off series, which springboarded from Jaime being brought back to life after her bionics failed; a consequence of this was she lost all memory of her relationship to Austin. Both ''The Six Million Dollar Man'' and ''The Bionic Woman'' went off the air in 1978.

A later episode reveals that Austin's biological father was also an Air Force pilot and was killed in the crash of his [[C-47 Skytrain]] in the [[China-Burma-India Theater]] during World War II.

Further details about Austin's later life were filled in during [[List of The Six Million Dollar Man episodes#TV-movies: 1987–94|three made-for-TV reunion movies that aired between 1987 and 1994]]. In the first (''[[The Return of the Six Million Dollar Man and the Bionic Woman]]''), which takes place several years after Austin retires from the OSI, it is revealed that he had a son, Michael, born in the mid-1960s. His mother is not identified. Michael subsequently suffers traumatic injuries in a crash similar to that which his father experienced, and undergoes bionic rebuilding which renders him more powerful than his bionic father. In exchange for Michael's operation, Austin agrees to return to OSI and his son also becomes an operative, though he did not appear in any subsequent films. In the second film, ''[[Bionic Showdown: The Six Million Dollar Man and the Bionic Woman]]'', Austin is shown to be a senior OSI operative helping thwart a terrorist attack against an athletic event in Canada. ''[[Bionic Ever After?]]'', the final reunion film, saw Austin's bionics malfunctioning due to a computer virus, but in the end he is rescued by Jaime and the two finally marry as the film ends. Unlike Jaime, who undergoes an upgrade to her bionics in ''Bionic Ever After?'' which apparently adds new abilities, no such upgrade was ever evidenced for Austin in the telefilms, with the exception of an apparent enhancement to his bionic eye which is illustrated in ''Bionic Ever After?''.

==Notes==
# {{note|app}} While the subsequent ''Six Million Dollar Man'' TV series also identified Austin's mission as Apollo 17, there were also contradictory names given at other times. In the 1973 pilot telefilm, ''Wine, Women and War'', Austin's flight is identified in dialogue as Apollo 19. Later, when the original ''Six Million Dollar Man'' telefilm (based upon the ''Cyborg'' novel) was reedited for syndication as a two-part episode entitled "The Moon and the Desert", a prologue was added that identified Austin's flight by the name.
# {{note|lmp}} In real life, [[Harrison Schmitt]], the prime LMP, did not need to be replaced by the backup LMP, [[Charles Duke]], who had already walked on the Moon as part of the [[Apollo 16]] crew.
# {{note|lift}} The name of the lifting body varies. In the ''Cyborg'' novel (and sequel books) and the later telefilm ''Return of the Six Million Dollar Man and the Bionic Woman'', the aircraft is identified as the M3-F5. In the ''Six Million Dollar Man'' episode, "The Deadly Replay", it is identified as the real-life [[Northrop HL-10]]. The actual footage used in the original telefilm (and subsequently in the opening credits of the series) was of both an HL-10 and the crash of an [[Northrop M2-F2|M2-F2]]. At no point in the original telefilm or later series was Austin's aircraft ever identified in dialogue as the M2-F2.

A '''subfossil''' (as opposed to a [[fossil]]) is a [[bone]] or other part of an organism that has not fully [[fossilization|fossilized]]. This may be because not enough time has elapsed since the animal died, or because the conditions in which the remains were deposited were not optimal for fossilization.

For remains such as molluscan [[seashell]]s, which frequently do not change their chemical composition over geological time, and may occasionally even retain such features as the original color markings for millions of years, the label "subfossil" is applied to shells that are understood to be thousands of years old, but are of [[Holocene]] age, and therefore are not old enough to be from the [[Pleistocene]] epoch.

Unfossilized or partially fossilized remains can include bones, [[exoskeleton]]s, nests, skin imprints, or [[coprolite|fecal deposits]]. Subfossils of vertebrates are often found in caves or other shelters, where the remains have been preserved for thousands of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main importance of these vertebrate subfossil (versus fully [[fossil]]ized) remains is that they contain organic material, which can be used for [[radiocarbon dating]] or the extraction and sequencing of [[DNA sequencing|DNA]], [[protein sequencing|protein]], or other biomolecules. Additionally, [[isotope]] ratios can provide information about the ecological conditions under which extinct animals lived. Subfossils are useful for studying the evolutionary history of an environment and can be important to studies in [[paleoclimatology]].

Subfossils are also often found in depositionary environments, such as lake sediments, oceanic sediments, and soils. Once deposited, physical and chemical [[weathering]] may alter the state of preservation, and small subfossils can also be ingested by living [[organisms]].

Subfossil remains that date from the [[Mesozoic]] are exceptionally rare, are usually in an advanced state of decay, and are consequently much disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The vast bulk of subfossil material comes from [[Quaternary]] sediments, including many subfossilized [[chironomid]] head capsules, [[ostracod]] [[carapace]]s, [[diatoms]], and [[foraminifera]].

[[File:Bunney GosfordStreet HAGAM.tif|thumb|Painting by Bunney of ''Gosford St. Coventry (near Cox St.) May 18th 1916'']]
'''Sydney John Bunney''' (1877–1928) was an English late Impressionist artist who left over 500 drawings of early 20th-century [[Coventry]].&lt;ref&gt;Mallalieu, H. L. ''The Dictionary of British Watercolour Artists up to 1920'', p.47&lt;/ref&gt;

Little is known of Bunney's life. In 1892 he was a student at [[Coventry School of Art and Design|Coventry School of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Ron. ''Sydney Bunney's Coventry: impressions of a graceful city'' 1999&lt;/ref&gt; He maintained contact with the school for many years, becoming the first Secretary to the school's sketch club in April 1907.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke 1999&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned from the post three years later but remained a member of the club until 1916.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Bunney's work as an artist matured under the influence of William Milnes, who became the headmaster at Coventry School of Art in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Milnes encouraged students to follow the example of [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner]] by taking quick sketches under differing conditions. This, according to Milnes, would give the artist a greater understanding of nature in its various moods. Many of Coventry's medieval buildings had survived up to the early 20th century, and Milnes pointed out that many of the buildings were suitable for studies on the effect of light.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Several students took up this idea, including H. E. Cox, and Bunney became a prolific painter of Coventry scenes. His body of work records the city as a market town, the streets lined with red-brick and half-timbered shops and houses.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Lucy, ''Coventry Evening Telegraph'', 17 December 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these pieces are small and intimate works of art.

He had great difficulty in having his work exhibited at any of the big shows, such as those at the [[Royal Academy]], and interest in his work largely waned before he was rediscovered in the late 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Bunney became a cashier at the Auto Machinery Company Limited in Coventry and in his later years lived at 154 Albany Road, [[Earlsdon]].&lt;ref&gt;Clarke 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Symphony No. 2''' by [[Gustav Mahler]], known as the '''''Resurrection Symphony''''', was written between 1888 and 1894, and first performed in 1895. This symphony was one of Mahler's most popular and successful works during his lifetime. It was his first major work that established his lifelong view of the beauty of afterlife and resurrection. In this large work, the composer further developed the creativity of "sound of the distance" and creating a "world of its own", aspects already seen in his [[Symphony No. 1 (Mahler)|First Symphony]]. The work has a duration of eighty to ninety minutes and is conventionally labelled as being in the key of C&amp;nbsp;minor; the ''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'' labels the work's tonality as C minor{{ndash}}E{{music|flat}} major.&lt;ref&gt;"Gustav Mahler", in ''New Grove'', Macmillan, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; It was voted the fifth-greatest symphony of all time in a survey of conductors carried out by the BBC Music Magazine.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/aug/04/beethoven-eroica-greatest-symphony-vote-bbc-mozart-mahler&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
Mahler completed what would become the first [[Movement (music)|movement]] of the symphony in 1888 as a single-movement [[symphonic poem]] called ''Totenfeier'' (Funeral Rites). Some sketches for the second movement also date from that year. Mahler wavered five years on whether to make ''Totenfeier'' the opening movement of a symphony, although his manuscript does label it as a symphony. In 1893, he composed the second and third movements.{{sfn|Steinberg|1995|p=285}} The finale was the problem. While thoroughly aware he was inviting comparison with [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 9]]—both symphonies use a chorus as the centerpiece of a final movement which begins with references to and is much longer than those preceding it—Mahler knew he wanted a vocal final movement. Finding the right text for this movement proved long and perplexing.{{sfn|Steinberg|1995|pp=290–291}}

When Mahler took up his appointment at the [[Hamburg State Opera|Hamburg Opera]] in 1891, he found the other important conductor there to be [[Hans von Bülow]], who was in charge of the city's symphony concerts. Bülow, not known for his kindness, was impressed by Mahler. His support was not diminished by his failure to like or understand ''Totenfeier'' when Mahler played it for him on the piano. Bülow told Mahler that ''Totenfeier'' made ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'' sound to him like a [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] symphony. As Bülow's health worsened, Mahler substituted for him. Bülow's death in 1894 greatly affected Mahler. At the funeral, Mahler heard a setting of [[Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock]]'s ''Die Auferstehung'' (The Resurrection), where the dictum calls out "Rise again, yes, you shall rise again / My dust".

"It struck me like lightning, this thing," he wrote to conductor [[Anton Seidl]], "and everything was revealed to me clear and plain." Mahler used the first two verses of Klopstock's hymn, then added verses of his own that dealt more explicitly with redemption and resurrection.{{sfn|Steinberg|1995|p=291}} He finished the finale and revised the orchestration of the first movement in 1894, then inserted the song "Urlicht" (Primal Light) as the penultimate movement. This song was probably written in 1892 or 1893.{{sfn|Steinberg|1995|p=285}}

Mahler initially devised a narrative programme (actually several variant versions) for the work, which he shared with a number of friends (including [[Natalie Bauer-Lechner]] and {{ill|Max Marschalk|de}}).  He even had one of these versions printed in the program book at the premiere in Dresden on 20 December 1901. In this programme, the first movement represents a funeral and asks questions such as "Is there life after death?"; the second movement is a remembrance of happy times in the life of the deceased; the third movement represents a view of life as meaningless activity; the fourth movement is a wish for release from life without meaning ; and the fifth movement – after a return of the doubts of the third movement and the questions of the first – ends with a fervent hope for everlasting, transcendent renewal, a theme that Mahler would ultimately transfigure into the music of ''[[Das Lied von der Erde]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kennedy-center.org/calendar/?fuseaction=composition&amp;composition_id=2484 |accessdate=2008-06-24 |title=Symphony No. 2 in C minor (Resurrection) |publisher=[[Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081019023943/http://www.kennedy-center.org/calendar/?fuseaction=composition&amp;composition_id=2484 |archivedate=October 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As generally happened, Mahler later withdrew all versions of the programme from circulation.

== Publication ==
The work was first published in 1897 by [[Friedrich Hofmeister Musikverlag|Friedrich Hofmeister]]. The rights were transferred to {{ill|Josef Weinberger|de|Josef Weinberger Musikverlagszentrum Wien}} shortly thereafter, and finally to Universal Edition, which released a second edition in 1910. A third edition was published in 1952, and a fourth, critical edition in 1970, both by Universal Edition. As part of the new complete critical edition of Mahler's symphonies being undertaken by the Gustav Mahler Society, a new critical edition of the Second Symphony was produced as a joint venture between Universal Edition and the [[Kaplan Foundation]]. Its world premiere performance was given on 18 October 2005 at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London with [[Gilbert Kaplan]] conducting the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classicalsource.com/db_control/db_concert_review.php?id=2928|title=Mahler Premiere |publisher=lassicalsource.com|accessdate=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reproductions of earlier editions have been released by [[Dover Publications|Dover]] and by [[Boosey &amp; Hawkes]]. The Kaplan Foundation published an extensive facsimile edition with additional materials in 1986.{{cn|date=August 2017}} 1989 saw the publication of an arrangement by [[Bruno Walter]] for piano four hands.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

== Form ==
The work in its finished form has five movements:

===I. Allegro maestoso===
{{listen|type=music
|filename=Mahler_Symphony_2_Movement_1.ogg
|title="Totenfeier" – First movement
|description=Performed by the Virtual Philharmonic Orchestra (Reinhold Behringer) with digital samples}}
The first movement is marked ''Mit durchaus ernstem und feierlichem Ausdruck'' (With complete gravity and solemnity of expression). It is written in C minor, but passes through a number of different moods, resembles a [[funeral march]].
:&lt;score vorbis="1"&gt;
  \relative c' { \clef treble \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 \key c \minor c1-^\p | d2^^ f4.^^ aes8-. | c2^^ g4.^^ g8-. | c2^^ \times 2/3 { r8 r8 c-. } \times 2/3 { d-. c-. b-. } | c8-.[ r16 g-.] c,8-. }
&lt;/score&gt; 
The movement's formal structure is modified sonata form. The exposition is repeated in a varied form (from [[rehearsal letter|rehearsal number]] 4 through 15, as [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] often did in his late string quartets). The development presents several ideas that will be used later in the symphony, including a theme based on the ''[[Dies irae]]'' plainchant.
:&lt;score vorbis="1"&gt;
  \relative c'' { \clef treble \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 \key ees \minor ges2^^\mf f^^ | ges^^ ees^^ | aes4^^ ges8^^ fes^^ ges4^^ ces,^^ | fes2^^ ees^^ }
&lt;/score&gt; 
Mahler uses a somewhat modified tonal framework for the movement. The secondary theme, first presented in E major (enharmonic of F{{music|flat}} major, [[Neapolitan chord|Neapolitan]] of E{{music|flat}}),&lt;ref&gt;Schram, Albert-George. ''Gustav Mahler: Symphony No. 2 (C minor): A Historical Background and Analysis.'' Thesis (D.Mus. Arts) University of Washington, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;score vorbis="1"&gt;
  \relative c'' { \clef treble \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 \key c \minor b2--\pp e4-- fis-- | gis-- a-- b-- cis8--( dis--) | fis4( e2) }
&lt;/score&gt;
begins its second statement in C major, a key in which it is not expected until the recapitulation. The statement in the recapitulation, coincidentally, is in the original E major (F{{music|flat}} major). The eventual goal of the symphony, E-flat major, is briefly hinted at after rehearsal 17, with a theme in the trumpets that returns in the finale.
:&lt;score vorbis="1"&gt;
  \relative c'' { \clef treble \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 \key ees \minor &lt;bes g ees&gt;2^^\p &lt;c aes ees&gt;^^ | &lt;ees bes ees,&gt;^^ r4 f, | g^^ bes^^\&lt; ees^^ d8[\!-. r16 c-.] | bes1\f }
&lt;/score&gt; 
Following this movement, Mahler calls in the score for a gap of five minutes before the second movement. This pause is rarely observed today. Often conductors will meet Mahler half way, pausing for a few minutes while the audience takes a breather and settles down and the orchestra retunes in preparation for the rest of the piece. [[Julius Buths]] received this instruction from Mahler personally, prior to a 1903 performance in [[Düsseldorf]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfsymphony.org/music/ProgramNotes.aspx?id=44484|title=San Francisco Symphony – Program Notes &amp; Articles|publisher=sfsymphony.org|accessdate=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, he chose instead to place the long pause between the fourth and fifth movements, for which Mahler congratulated him on his insight, sensitivity, and daring to go against his stated wishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kennedy-center.org/calendar/?fuseaction=composition&amp;composition_id=2484|title=Monthly Calendar – November 2016|publisher=kennedy-center.org|accessdate=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A practical way of following Mahler's original indication is to have the two soloists and the chorus enter the stage only after the first movement. This creates a natural separation between the first movement and the rest of the symphony and also saves the singers more than twenty minutes of sitting on stage. One can get an idea of Mahler's intention through a comparison with his [[Symphony No. 3 (Mahler)|Symphony No. 3]], where – due to the length of the piece – a real break after the first movement (as between two acts of an opera) is highly recommended, and indeed indicated by Mahler. As in the case of Symphony No. 2, this is not always observed nowadays.

===II. Andante moderato ===
The second movement is marked ''Sehr gemächlich. Nie eilen.'' (Very leisurely. Never rush.) It is a delicate [[Ländler]] in [[A-flat major|A{{music|flat}} major]].
:&lt;score vorbis="1"&gt;
  \relative c' { \clef treble \time 3/8 \key aes \major \tempo 8 = 92 \partial 8*1 ees16^"grazioso"\p r | ees8( c16-. des-. ees-. f-.) | ees8(\upbow aes aes)}
&lt;/score&gt;
with two contrasting sections of slightly darker music.
:&lt;score vorbis="1"&gt;
  \relative c'' { \clef treble \time 3/8 \key gis \minor \tempo 8 = 92 \partial 8*1 \times 2/3 { dis'16-.\ppp cisis-. dis-. } | \times 2/3 { e-.[ dis-. cis!-.] } \times 2/3 { b-.[ ais-. gis-.] } \times 2/3 { fisis-.[ gis-. ais-.] } | \times 2/3 { gis^^([ dis-.) dis-.] } \times 2/3 { dis-.[ dis-. dis-.] } \times 2/3 {dis-.[ dis-. dis-.] } }
&lt;/score&gt; 
This slow movement itself is contrasting to the two adjacent movements. Structurally, it is one of the simplest movements in Mahler's whole output. It is the remembrance of the joyful times in the life of the deceased.

===III. ''In ruhig fließender Bewegung'' (With quietly flowing movement) ===
The third movement is a [[scherzo]] in [[C minor]]. It opens with two strong, short [[timpani]] strokes.
:&lt;score&gt; \relative c { \clef bass \time 3/8 \key c \minor \partial 16*1 g16^^\ff | c8^^ } &lt;/score&gt;
It is followed by two softer strokes, and then followed by even softer strokes that provide the [[tempo]] to this movement, which includes references to Jewish folk music.
:&lt;score vorbis="1"&gt; \relative c' { \clef treble \time 3/8 \key c \minor \partial 8*1 c16(\p g | c d ees f g aes | g ees c d ees f | \slashedGrace { aes } g fis g b c d | ees) } &lt;/score&gt;
Mahler called the climax of the movement, which occurs near the end, sometimes a "cry of despair", and sometimes a "death shriek". 
:&lt;score vorbis="1"&gt; { \new PianoStaff &lt;&lt; \new Staff \relative c'' { \clef treble \time 3/8 \key c \major &lt;bes'' f des bes&gt;4.\fff } \new Staff \relative c { \clef bass \time 3/8 \key c \major &lt;c c,&gt;4. } &gt;&gt; } &lt;/score&gt;
The movement is based on Mahler's setting of "Des Antonius von Padua Fischpredigt" from "Des Knaben Wunderhorn", which Mahler composed almost concurrently; in correspondence, Mahler expressed amusement that his sinuous musical setting could imply [[St. Anthony of Padua]] was himself drunk as he preached to the fish.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} 

In 1967–68, the movement was used by [[Luciano Berio]] for the third movement of his ''[[Sinfonia (Berio)|Sinfonia]]'', where it is used as the framework for constructing a musical collage of works from throughout the Western classical tradition.

===IV. "Urlicht" ===

|title="Urlicht" – Fourth movement
|description=Performed by the Virtual Philharmonic Orchestra (Reinhold Behringer) with digital samples. Solo voice has been replaced by solo cello.}}
The fourth movement, "Urlicht" (Primeval Light) is marked ''Sehr feierlich, aber schlicht'' (Very solemn, but simple). It is a ''[[Des Knaben Wunderhorn (Mahler)|Wunderhorn]]'' song, sung by an [[alto]], which serves as an introduction to the Finale. The song, set in the remote key of [[D-flat major|D{{music|b}} major]], illustrates the longing for relief from worldly woes, leading without a break to the response in the Finale.
:&lt;score&gt; { \new PianoStaff &lt;&lt; \new Staff \relative c' { \clef treble \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 \key des \major \partial 4*1 des4 | des2\fermata ees\fermata | f1\fermata } \addlyrics {O Rös- chen rot! } \new Staff \relative c' { \clef bass \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 \key des \major \partial 4*1 r4 | &lt;bes f bes,&gt;2\fermata &lt;c aes ees aes,&gt;\fermata | &lt;des aes des, aes des,&gt;1\fermata } &gt;&gt; } &lt;/score&gt;

===V. ''Im Tempo des Scherzos'' (In the tempo of the scherzo)===
The finale is the longest, typically lasting over half an hour. It is divided into two large parts, the second of which begins with the entry of the chorus and whose form is governed by the text of this movement. The first part is instrumental, and very episodic, containing a wide variety of moods, tempi and keys, with much of the material based on what has been heard in the previous movements, although it also loosely follows sonata principles. New themes introduced are used repeatedly and altered.

The movement opens with a long introduction, beginning with the "cry of despair" that was the climax of the third movement, followed by the quiet presentation of a theme which reappears as structural music in the choral section,
:&lt;score vorbis="1"&gt;
 \relative c'' { \clef treble \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 \key c \major g'4.-- c,8~-- c d-- e-- f-- | g4. } &lt;/score&gt;
and by a call in the offstage horns.
:&lt;score vorbis="1"&gt;
  \relative c { \clef bass \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 \key c \major \partial 4*1 f4-^ | c'2-^\fermata r4 f,4-^^"(Echo)" | c'2-^\fermata r4 \times 2/3 { c8-^ f,-^ c'-^ } | f2-^ g2~-^ | g2\fermata } &lt;/score&gt;
The first theme group reiterates the ''Dies irae'' theme from the first movement, and then introduces the "resurrection" theme to which the chorus will sing their first words, and finally a fanfare. 
:&lt;score vorbis="1"&gt; \relative c' { \clef treble \numericTimeSignature \key f \minor \time 4/4 \partial 4*1 c\p-^ | f2-^ g-^ | f-^ r4 c8-^ ees-^ | aes4-^ g-^ f2-^ | ees-^ } &lt;/score&gt;
The second theme is a long orchestral recitative, which provides the music for the alto solo in the choral section.&lt;br&gt; 
:&lt;score vorbis="1"&gt;
  \relative c'' { \clef treble \time 2/2 \key bes \minor \partial 4*1 ges4~\sf | ges2\p\&gt;( f4)\!~ r | r1 | r4 ges2.(\sf\&gt; | f4)\!\p r r ges~\&lt; | ges\! f--\p ees-- f-- | des2.(\pp bes4) } &lt;/score&gt;
The exposition concludes with a restatement of the first theme group. This long opening section serves to introduce a number of themes, which will become important in the choral part of the finale.

The development section is what Mahler calls the "march of the dead".  It begins with two long drum rolls, which include the use of the gongs. In addition to developing the ''Dies irae'' and resurrection themes and motives from the opening cry of despair, this section also states, episodically, a number of other themes, based on earlier material. The recapitulation overlaps with the march, and only brief statements of the first theme group are restated. The orchestral recitative is fully recapitulated, and is accompanied this time by offstage interruptions from a band of brass and percussion (which some had explained as the apocalypse's [[seven trumpets]]). This builds to a climax, which leads into a restatement of the opening introductory section. The horn call is expanded into Mahler's "Great Summons", a transition into the choral section.

Tonally, this first large part, the instrumental half of the movement, is organized in F minor. After the introduction, which recalls two keys from earlier movements, the first theme group is presented wholly in F minor, and the second theme group in the subdominant, B{{music|flat}} minor. The restatement of the first theme group occurs in the dominant, C major. The development explores a number of keys, including the mediant, A{{music|flat}} major, and the parallel major, F major. Unlike the first movement, the second theme is recapitulated as expected in the tonic key. The restatement of the introduction is thematically and tonally a transition to the second large part, moving from C{{music|sharp}} minor to the parallel D{{music|flat}} major — the dominant of F{{music|sharp}} minor — in which the Great Summons is stated. The Epiphany comes in, played by the flute, in a high register, and featuring trumpets, that play offstage. The choral section begins in G{{music|flat}} major.

The chorus comes in quietly a little past the halfway point of the movement. 
:&lt;score vorbis="1"&gt;
{ \new ChoralStaff &lt;&lt; \new Staff \relative c' { \clef treble \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 \key ges \major des2\ppp ees | des\fermata } \addlyrics { Auf- er- steh'n, } \new Staff \relative c' { \clef bass \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 \key ges \major &lt;bes ges ges,&gt;2 &lt;bes ges ees ees,&gt; | &lt;bes ges des des,&gt;\fermata } &gt;&gt; } &lt;/score&gt;
The choral section is organized primarily by the text, using musical material from earlier in the movement. (The B{{music|flat}} below the bass clef occurs four times in the choral bass part: three at the chorus' hushed entrance and again on the words "Hör' auf zu beben". It is the lowest vocal note in standard classical repertoire. Mahler instructs basses incapable of singing the note remain silent rather than sing the note an octave higher.) Each of the first two verses is followed by an instrumental interlude; the alto and soprano solos, "O Glaube",
:&lt;score&gt; \relative c'' { \clef treble \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 \key des \major \partial 4*1 ges4 | ges2 f } \addlyrics { O glau- be, } &lt;/score&gt;
based on the recitative melody, precede the fourth verse, sung by the chorus; and the fifth verse is a duet for the two soloists. The opening two verses are presented in G{{music|flat}} major, the solos and the fourth verse in B{{music|flat}} minor (the key in which the recitative was originally stated), and the duet in A{{music|flat}} major. The goal of the symphony, E{{music|flat}} major, the relative major of the opening C minor, is achieved when the chorus picks up the words from the duet, "Mit Flügeln",
:&lt;score vorbis="1"&gt; \relative c { \clef bass \numericTimeSignature \time 2/2 \key ees \major \partial 2*1 aes2 | bes2. g4 | aes bes c d | f2. ees4 | d ees8( c) bes4 c8( aes) | g2 bes } \addlyrics { Mit Flü- geln, die ich mir er- run- gen, wer- de ich ent- schwe- ben! } &lt;/score&gt;
although after eight measures the music gravitates to G major (but never cadences on it).

E{{music|flat}} suddenly reenters with the text "Sterben werd' ich um zu leben," and a proper cadence finally occurs on the downbeat of the final verse, with the entrance of the heretofore silent organ (marked ''volles Werk'', full organ) and with the choir instructed to sing ''mit höchster Kraft'' (with highest power). The instrumental coda is in this ultimate key as well, and is accompanied by the tolling of deep bells. Mahler went so far as to purchase actual church bells for performances, finding all other means of achieving this sound unsatisfactory. Mahler wrote of this movement: "The increasing tension, working up to the final climax, is so tremendous that I don't know myself, now that it is over, how I ever came to write it."&lt;ref&gt;[[Natalie Bauer-Lechner]], ''Recollections of Gustav Mahler'', trans. Dika Newlin, ed. Peter Franklin (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1980), pp. 43–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;poem lang="de" style="float:left;"&gt;'''Original German'''

'''Urlicht'''
O Röschen rot!
Der Mensch liegt in größter Not!
Der Mensch liegt in größter Pein!
Je lieber möcht' ich im Himmel sein.
Da kam ich auf einen breiten Weg:
Da kam ein Engelein und wollt' mich abweisen.
Ach nein! Ich ließ mich nicht abweisen!
Ich bin von Gott und will wieder zu Gott!
Der liebe Gott wird mir ein Lichtchen geben,
Wird leuchten mir bis in das ewig selig Leben!

—''Des Knaben Wunderhorn''&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem style="margin-left:2em; float:left;"&gt;'''In English'''

'''Primeval Light'''
O little red rose!
Man lies in greatest need!
Man lies in greatest pain!
How I would rather be in heaven.
There came I upon a broad path
when came a little angel and wanted to turn me away.
Ah no! I would not let myself be turned away!
I am from God and shall return to God!
The loving God will grant me a little light,
Which will light me into that eternal blissful life!&lt;/poem&gt;{{Clear|left}}

=== Fifth movement ===
&lt;small&gt;Note: The first eight lines were taken from the poem ''Die Auferstehung'' by [[Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock]].&lt;ref&gt;Klopstock's ''Die Auferstehung'' is not, as is commonly believed, one of his ''Oden'', but rather from a set entitled ''Geistliche Lieder'' (Spiritual Songs).&lt;/ref&gt; Mahler omitted the final four lines of this poem and wrote the rest himself (beginning at "O glaube").&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;poem lang="de" style="float:left;"&gt;'''Original German'''

Aufersteh'n, ja aufersteh'n
Wirst du, Mein Staub,
Nach kurzer Ruh'!
Unsterblich Leben! Unsterblich Leben
wird der dich rief dir geben!

Wieder aufzublüh'n wirst du gesät!
Der Herr der Ernte geht
und sammelt Garben
uns ein, die starben!

—Friedrich Klopstock

O glaube, mein Herz, o glaube:
Es geht dir nichts verloren!
Dein ist, ja dein, was du gesehnt!
Dein, was du geliebt,
Was du gestritten!

O glaube
Du wardst nicht umsonst geboren!
Hast nicht umsonst gelebt, gelitten!

Was entstanden ist
Das muss vergehen!
Was vergangen, auferstehen!
Hör' auf zu beben!
Bereite dich zu leben!

O Schmerz! Du Alldurchdringer!
Dir bin ich entrungen!
O Tod! Du Allbezwinger!
Nun bist du bezwungen!

Mit Flügeln, die ich mir errungen,
In heißem Liebesstreben,
Werd' ich entschweben
Zum Licht, zu dem kein Aug' gedrungen!

Sterben werd' ich, um zu leben!
Aufersteh'n, ja aufersteh'n
wirst du, mein Herz, in einem Nu!
Was du geschlagen
zu Gott wird es dich tragen!

—Gustav Mahler&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem style="margin-left:2em; float:left;"&gt;'''In English'''

Rise again, yes, rise again,
Will you My dust,
After a brief rest!
Immortal life! Immortal life
Will He who called you, give you.

To bloom again were you sown!
The Lord of the harvest goes
And gathers in, like sheaves,
Us together, who died.
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
O believe, my heart, O believe:
Nothing to you is lost!
Yours is, yes yours, is what you desired
Yours, what you have loved
What you have fought for!

O believe,
You were not born for nothing!
Have not for nothing, lived, suffered!

What was created
Must perish,
What perished, rise again!
Cease from trembling!
Prepare yourself to live!

O Pain, You piercer of all things,
From you, I have been wrested!
O Death, You conqueror of all things,
Now, are you conquered!

With wings which I have won for myself,
In love's fierce striving,
I shall soar upwards
To the light which no eye has penetrated!

Die shall I in order to live.
Rise again, yes, rise again,
Will you, my heart, in an instant!
That for which you suffered,
To God shall it carry you!&lt;/poem&gt;{{Clear|left}}

The '''Well World series''' is a series of [[science fiction]] novels by [[Jack L. Chalker]]. It involves a planet-sized [[supercomputer]] known as the Well of Souls that builds our reality on top of an underlying one of greater complexity but smaller size. The computer was built by a now-extinct race, the Markovians, who developed the Well of Souls with the goal of creating a new species that would transcend their own.

The Well World is the planet that houses the Well of Souls, and it exists within the original Markovian reality. Its surface was used as an experimental site where the Markovians tested their species designs before sending the successful ones into the new universe to populate planets. Humans are one of many such designed species who now live in the "real" world. During the time period of the novels, the Well World has been abandoned and left on its own for an unknown length of time.

The books mainly follow a mysterious character known as Nathan Brazil, who has an (initially) unknown connection to the Well World. The books are adventures that follow Brazil and a changing cast of secondary characters through a series of visits to the Well World over a period of hundreds (and millions) of years.

== Setting ==
The series is largely set on a [[fictional planet]] named Well World.{{sfn|Jacob|Apple|2000|p=42}} The Well World was constructed by an ancient [[alien species]], known as the Markovians, who felt they had reached a dead end in their evolution. The Well World houses a planet-sized, reality-shaping computer that creates an artificial universe layered on top of the much smaller, original Markovian one.{{sfn|Jacob|Apple|2000|p=42}} The Well World exists within the original Markovian universe, and can only be accessed through gateways on a number of Markovian planets scattered through the artificial universe. The Markovians experimented in species design on the Well World, sending the more successful ones into the new universe to populate one of these planets.{{sfn|Belin|1989|p=239}} By the time of the stories in the series, the Markovians have vanished, leaving behind the Well World, continually maintaining the new universe.{{sfn|Belin|1989|p=239}}

The Well World's surface is composed primarily of 1560 large hexagonal regions—called "hexes"—each with an independent and often dramatically different climate and ecosystem,{{sfn|Langford|2005|p=328}}{{sfn|Belin|1989|p=239}} that [[David Langford]] compares to the [[hexagonal tiling|hexagonally tile]]d boards used in "hex-and-counter" forms of [[board wargame|tabletop wargaming]].{{sfn|Langford|2005|p=328}}  Each of these hexes is a prototype environment for a planet that exists in the external universe,{{sfn|Smith|1986|pp=127&amp;ndash;128}} half of which, comprising the planet's southern hemisphere, contain carbon-based (or similar) oxygen-breathing life. The North is made up of exotic species which are often so alien that no common ground exists between them and the Southern races, and, often, their Northern neighbors as well. Since the Northern hemisphere contains, for example, seas of oxygen, chlorine, methane, and ammonia, Southern races need some kind of life support in the North. {{sfn|Belin|1989|p=239}} The two hemispheres are separated by an impermeable wall that extends "several kilometers upward". In the hexes that are bisected by the wall there is a separate gateway (the "avenue") to the Well of Souls, the control center for the computer.

The Well World computer also maintains a "tech level" for each of the hexes, making equipment of a higher level simply fail to work. High-tech hexes work as in the "real" universe, allowing any device to work. Semi-tech hexes allow simple machines to work, up to about the level of the steam engine, and any device using electricity will not work. Low-tech hexes allow no machines to work, and all effort has to be created by muscles. Even then, there are exceptions; Gedamondas is low-tech, but the Gedamondans can use naturally occurring steam from their volcanic vents, and the Agitar can electrocute people in any hex, regardless of tech level. Also, while chemical firearms do not, as a general rule, work in nontech hexes, matches and certain kinds of chemical explosives will, although the explosives can be dangerously unstable in nontech hexes. In some of the hexes, however, the Well World computer allows the inhabitants access to limited manipulation of reality, or "magic" (this is most commonly in low- and semi-tech hexes, but high-tech magic hexes have been mentioned). Vehicles that travel from hex to hex need to be equipped with multiple forms of power.

In addition to the hexes, the two polar regions, or "zones" contain maintenance areas, including a series of ambassadorial offices. These can be reached via gateways near the centers of each of the hexes, allowing easy transit from hex to pole for meetings and other duties. Newcomers to the Well World find themselves in the zones, where they are greeted by one of the ambassadors and then sent through a gateway. During this initial transit, the Well World computer transforms the traveler into a member of one of the many races, and sends them on to the associated hexes. From that point, the traveler is treated as a native of that hex. Since the only way to enter/leave Zone is through a Zone Gate, and exiting through any Zone Gate always takes one to their home hex, it is generally impossible for Southern and Northern races to travel into the other hemisphere. An InterZone Gate allows Northern and Southern ambassadors to travel between opposite Zones, and most materials can be transported via Zone gates, so there is some limited trade between North and South; for example, "universal translators" are grown in a Northern hex, and allow almost all races to communicate, at least within the limits of common ground. A very few instances of travel from North to South (or vice versa) have occurred, but these were exceptional.

The Equatorial Barrier contains six "Avenues" on either side of the barrier; each avenue leads up to the naked barrier. These are the only authorized entry points to the Well of Souls computer which controls and regulates the entire universe. The main control room contains what appears to be a crystal model of the Well World, but is, in fact, a separate control computer which regulates and stabilizes the Well World itself. This allows the main computer to be shut down and restarted without destroying the Well World. Any person who carries the "Original" pattern is converted into "Markovian" (also "Ancient", "Creator", or "Maker") form to solve design problems, as only this form possesses the capacity, knowledge, and capabilities necessary to interface with the main Brain. Also, any such personnel are recognized during Well processing, and treated as individuals of the race from which they originated. For this reason, Nathan Brazil (and, later, Mavra Chang) is translated to Glathrial, the home of type 41 (humans), without even being normalized to the Well-specific form.

In addition to the Well World, some of the action in the stories, typically the introductions, takes place in the multi-stellar human empire. In the early books this largely controlled by the Community of Worlds (the "Com"), where [[genetically engineered]] [[cloning|clones]] are widely used to form peaceful [[communist]] societies. In later books the Community has been replaced by the Realm, a confederation of over forty races. In the Watchers at the Well trilogy, the action starts on contemporary Earth long after the reset of the Well Computer.

== Analysis ==
Writer Max P. Belin observes that as a plot device, the Well World has its advantages and disadvantages.  It enables the protagonists of the stories to travel "across mountains, grasslands, oceans, deserts, and forests" without the use of any magical means for moving from world to world (such as those in C. S. Lewis's ''[[The Magician's Nephew]]'' (1955), which would be outside the domain of a science fiction story) or inexplicable "hypertechnology."  Rather, they travel under their own power from hex to hex.  (With many hexes, it is possible to travel from one border to another in a matter of days, or sometimes weeks.)  Since each hex not only has different environments and species &amp;mdash; ranging from conventional classical mythological species such as [[yeti]], [[centaur]]s, and [[satyr]]s to more esoteric science fiction species such as giant carnivorous insects and mobile plants &amp;mdash; but as well a different, fixed, level of allowable technology &amp;mdash; from ''non-tech'' and ''semi-tech'' hexes through to highly advanced technology that closely resembles outright magic (plus actual Well magic) &amp;mdash; and since there are 1,560 of them, the author never need repeat situations and locations through the entire series of books.{{sfn|Belin|1989|p=239}}

The Well World also introduces extra plot elements.  Since every person apart from Nathan Brazil, a major protagonist of several of the stories, is transformed into one of the Well World's own 1,560 species by the act of passing through the gateway on a Markovian world to the Well World, they have to cope with travelling companions who used to be human but no longer are, and all of the ensuing problems.{{sfn|Belin|1989|p=239}}

The Well World forces the introduction of two additional plot elements into every story. Since the only routes to the Well World from the outside are the gateways on the now-deserted and forgotten Markovian planets, every story has to incorporate their rediscovery in some fashion. Similarly, since there is no normal way off the Well World's surface from the hexes to either the original Markovian or the new artificial universe, every story has to incorporate an "escape from an escape-proof laboratory" of some kind for the characters to interact with the external universe.  Furthermore, the nature of the Well World as a set of laboratory environments, whose technology levels and ecosystems are forcibly computer-controlled, limits what can potentially occur therein.{{sfn|Belin|1989|p=239}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2419">'''Æthelswith''' (c. 838–888) was the only known daughter of King [[Æthelwulf of Wessex]]. She became Queen Æthelswith when she married King [[Burgred of Mercia]] in 853. The couple had no issue.  Her marriage probably signalled the subordination of Burgred to his father-in-law and the Saxon kingdom at a time when both Wessex and [[Mercia]] were suffering Danish (Viking) raids. Burgred also had ongoing problems with the Kingdom of [[Powys]] on his western border and in 853 Æthelwulf subjugated the Welsh state on Burgred's behalf. 

Repeated Danish incursions over the years gradually weakened Mercia militarily and in 868 Burgred was forced to call upon Æthelswith's brother King [[Æthelred of Wessex]] to assist him in confronting an entrenched Danish army at Nottingham. This was the last time the Saxons came to the aid of the Mercians and is also notable as the occasion on which [[Alfred the Great]], another brother of Æthelswith's, married his Mercian wife [[Ealhswith]].

Burgred's reign lasted till 874 when the [[Vikings]] drove him from the kingdom and he fled to Rome with Æthelswith. He died shortly after. Æthelswith lived on in Italy, to be buried at [[Pavia]] in 888.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Keynes]] &amp; [[Michael Lapidge]] eds, Alfred the Great, ''Asser's Life of King Alfred and Other Contemporary Sources'' (Penguin Classics).
