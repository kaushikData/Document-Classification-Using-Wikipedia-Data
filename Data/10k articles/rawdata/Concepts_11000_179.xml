The '''2001 sex strike for running water''' in [[Turkey]] began when women in a Turkish village initiated a nonviolent direct action to persuade the men of the village to fix a broken water system.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu Global Nonviolent Action Database] April 13, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
==Background==
In 2001, a southern Turkish village near [[Siirt]] suffered from a broken down water supply system. This was not the first time the system had stopped, leaving the 600-person village without running water for months at a time. When the water system breaks down, the women must walk  several miles to a small public [[fountain]] in order to have water for drinking, cooking and bathing.

In mid-July 2001, women in the village began a [[sex strike]] to encourage their husbands to demand that the government repair the water system. The idea of the sex strike came from a Turkish movie from 1983 in which women held a sex strike for better equality between the genders.

The lack of running water prevented women from bathing after sex, which is traditionally required of [[Muslim]] women. This ritual is known as [[Ritual purification#Islam|ritual purification]], which has to do with preparation for prayer that occurs five times a day.

Within one month of the sex strike, the men began asking the Siirt government for assistance to fix the water system. On August 15, the government supplied the village with enough resources to fix the water system themselves.

==Related events==
A film, ''[[The Source (2011 film)|The Source]]'', was created in 2011 capturing a similar story in a [[North Africa]]. The women of the village take part in a sex strike against having to walk to a water source to collect water.

[[File:Psittacus erithacus -Norway -pet-8a.jpg|thumb|300px|right|alt=A grey parrot peers into the camera|According to the [[#Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness|Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness]], "near human-like levels of consciousness" have been observed in the [[grey parrot]].&lt;ref name=CDC /&gt;]]

'''Animal consciousness''', or '''animal awareness''', is the [[Quality (philosophy)|quality]] or state of self-awareness within an animal, or of being aware of an external object or something within itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=consciousness|publisher=Merriam-Webster|location=|accessdate=22 April 2014|url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/consciousness}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="van_Gulick2004"&gt;{{cite web |author=Robert van Gulick |year=2004 |title=Consciousness |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In humans, [[consciousness]] has been defined as: [[sentience]], [[awareness]], [[subjectivity]], [[qualia]], the ability to [[experience]] or to [[feeling|feel]], [[wakefulness]], having a sense of [[self]]hood, and the executive control system of the mind.&lt;ref name=Farthing1992Psychology&gt;{{cite book| title=The Psychology of Consciousness |author=Farthing G |year=1992 |publisher=Prentice Hall |isbn=978-0-13-728668-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the difficulty in definition, many philosophers believe there is a broadly shared underlying intuition about what consciousness is.&lt;ref name="John Searle 2005"&gt;{{cite book |author=John Searle |author-link=John Searle |year=2005 |editor=Honderich T |title=The Oxford companion to philosophy |chapter=Consciousness |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-926479-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The topic of animal consciousness is beset with a number of difficulties. It poses the [[problem of other minds]] in an especially severe form because animals, lacking the ability to use human language, cannot tell us about their experiences.&lt;ref name=Allen&gt;{{cite web |author=Colin Allen |title=Animal consciousness |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2011 Edition) |editor=Edward N. Zalta |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2011/entries/consciousness-animal/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, it is difficult to reason objectively about the question, because a denial that an animal is conscious is often taken to imply that it does not feel, its life has no value, and that harming it is not morally wrong. The 17th-century French philosopher [[René Descartes]], for example, has sometimes been blamed for mistreatment of animals because he argued that only humans are conscious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Peter Carruthers |author-link=Peter Carruthers (philosopher) |title=Sympathy and subjectivity |journal=Australasian Journal of Philosophy |year=1999 |volume=77 |pages=465–482 |doi=10.1080/00048409912349231 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophers who consider subjective experience the essence of consciousness also generally believe, as a correlate, that the existence and nature of animal consciousness can never rigorously be known. The American philosopher [[Thomas Nagel]] spelled out this point of view in an influential essay titled ''[[What Is it Like to Be a Bat?]]''. He said that an organism is conscious "if and only if there is something that it is like to be that organism—something it is like ''for'' the organism"; and he argued that no matter how much we know about an animal's brain and behavior, we can never really put ourselves into the mind of the animal and experience its world in the way it does itself.&lt;ref name=NagelBat&gt;{{cite book| author=Thomas Nagel| author-link=Thomas Nagel|title=Mortal Questions |chapter=Ch. 12 What is it like to be a bat? |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-521-40676-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other thinkers, such as the cognitive scientist [[Douglas Hofstadter]], dismiss this argument as incoherent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Douglas Hofstadter |author-link=Douglas Hofstadter |chapter=Reflections on ''What Is It Like to Be a Bat?'' |pages=403–414 |title=The Mind's I |editor=Douglas Hofstadter |editor-link=Douglas Hofstadter  |editor2=Daniel Dennett|editor2-link=Daniel Dennett |publisher=Basic Books |year=1981 |isbn=978-0-7108-0352-8|title-link=The Mind's I }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several psychologists and ethologists have argued for the existence of animal consciousness by describing a range of behaviors that appear to show animals holding beliefs about things they cannot directly perceive—[[Donald Griffin]]'s 2001 book ''Animal Minds'' reviews a substantial portion of the evidence.&lt;ref name=Griffin2001&gt;{{cite book |title=Animal Minds: Beyond Cognition to Consciousness |author=Donald Griffin |author-link=Donald Griffin |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-226-30865-4 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=OQGJz1DVQNMC&amp;pg=PA77&amp;dq=%22On+the+origin+of+consciousness+%E2%80%94+some+amniote+scenarios%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22On%20the%20origin%20of%20consciousness%20%E2%80%94%20some%20amniote%20scenarios%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Animal consciousness has been actively researched for over one hundred years.&lt;ref name=Burghardt&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Burghardt | first1 = Gordon M | year = 1985 | title = Animal awareness: Current perceptions and historical perspective | url = http://colinallen.dnsalias.org/Secure/X521/Burghardt%201985.pdf | format = PDF | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 40 | issue = 8| pages = 905–919 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.40.8.905 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916204733/http://colinallen.dnsalias.org/Secure/X521/Burghardt%201985.pdf | archivedate=16 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927 the American functional psychologist [[Harvey A.

Non-human animals, including all mammals and birds, and many other creatures, including octopuses, also possess these neural substrates."&lt;ref name="Andrews 2014 p. 51"&gt;{{cite book | last=Andrews | first=K. | title=The Animal Mind: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Animal Cognition | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis | year=2014 | isbn=978-1-317-67676-8 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UyAhBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA51 | page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophical background ==

[[File:Jan Baptist Weenix - Portrait of René Descartes.jpg|thumb|right|René Descartes argued that only humans are conscious, and not other animals]]

The [[mind–body problem]] in philosophy examines the relationship between [[mind]] and matter, and in particular the relationship between [[consciousness]] and the brain. A variety of approaches have been proposed. Most are either [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualist]] or [[Monism|monist]]. Dualism maintains a rigid distinction between the realms of mind and matter. Monism maintains that there is only one kind of stuff, and that mind and matter are both aspects of it. The problem was addressed by pre-[[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] philosophers,&lt;ref name="Young"&gt;{{cite book |editor1=RC Olby |editor2=GN Cantor |editor3=JR Christie |editor4=MJS Hodges |title= Companion to the History of Modern Science |publisher=Taylor and Francis |year= 1996 |pages= 702–11 |isbn=978-0415145787 |chapter=The mind-body problem |chapter-url=http://human-nature.com/rmyoung/papers/pap102h.html |author= Robert M. Young |edition=Paperback reprint of Routledge 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Robinson&gt;{{cite web |author=Robinson, Howard |title=Dualism |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2011 Edition) |editor=Edward N. Zalta |url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2011/entries/dualism/ |date=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was famously addressed by [[René Descartes]] in the 17th century, resulting in [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Cartesian dualism]]. Descartes believed that humans only, and not other animals have this non-physical mind.

The rejection of the mind–body dichotomy is found in French [[Structuralism]], and is a position that generally characterized post-war [[French philosophy]].&lt;ref name=Turner&gt;{{cite book |title=The Body and Society: Explorations in Social Theory |author=Bryan S. Turner |page=78 |quote=...a rejection of any dualism between mind and body, and a consequent insistence on the argument that the body is never simply a physical object but always an embodiment of consciousness. |isbn=978-1412929875 |year=2008 |publisher=Sage Publications |edition=3rd |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FYKjzsc6SkAC}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The absence of an empirically identifiable meeting point between the non-physical mind and its physical extension has proven problematic to dualism and many modern philosophers of mind maintain that the mind is not something separate from the body.&lt;ref name="Kim1"&gt;{{cite book

=== Epiphenomenalism ===

[[Epiphenomenalism]] is the theory in [[philosophy of mind]] that mental phenomena are caused by physical processes in the brain or that both are effects of a common cause, as opposed to mental phenomena driving the physical mechanics of the brain. The impression that thoughts, feelings, or sensations cause physical effects, is therefore to be understood as illusory to some extent. For example, it is not the feeling of fear that produces an increase in heart beat, both are symptomatic of a common physiological origin, possibly in response to a legitimate external threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/epipheno/| title=Epiphenomenalism| author=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy| accessdate=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of epiphenomenalism goes back to the post-Cartesian attempt to solve the riddle of [[Cartesian dualism]], i.e., of how mind and body could interact. [[Julien Offray de La Mettrie|La Mettrie]], [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] and [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]] all in their own way began this way of thinking. The idea that even if the animal were conscious nothing would be added to the production of behavior, even in animals of the human type, was first voiced by La Mettrie (1745), and then by [[Pierre Jean George Cabanis|Cabanis]] (1802), and was further explicated by [[Hodgson]] (1870) and [[T.H. Huxley|Huxley]] (1874).&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, T. H. (1874). "On the Hypothesis that Animals are Automata, and its History", ''The Fortnightly Review'', n.s.16:555-580. Reprinted in ''Method and Results: Essays by Thomas H. Huxley'' (New York: D. Appleton and Company, 1898)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher, S. 2006. "Where's the action?: Epiphenomenalism and the problem of free will". In W. Banks, S. Pockett, and S. Gallagher. ''Does Consciousness Cause Behavior? An Investigation of the Nature of Intuition'' (109-124). Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Huxley (1874) likened mental phenomena to the whistle on a steam locomotive. However, epiphenomenalism flourished primarily as it found a niche among methodological or scientific behaviorism. In the early 1900s [[behaviorism|scientific behaviorists]] such as [[Ivan Pavlov]], [[John B. Watson]], and [[B. F. Skinner]] began the attempt to uncover laws describing the relationship between stimuli and responses, without reference to inner mental phenomena. Instead of adopting a form of [[eliminative materialism|eliminativism]] or mental [[fictionalism]], positions that deny that inner mental phenomena exist, a behaviorist was able to adopt epiphenomenalism in order to allow for the existence of mind. However, by the 1960s, scientific behaviourism met substantial difficulties and eventually gave way to the [[cognitive revolution]]. Participants in that revolution, such as [[Jerry Fodor]], reject epiphenomenalism and insist upon the efficacy of the mind. Fodor even speaks of "epiphobia"—fear that one is becoming an epiphenomenalist.

[[Thomas Henry Huxley]] defends in an essay titled ''On the Hypothesis that Animals are Automata, and its History'' an epiphenomenalist theory of consciousness according to which consciousness is a causally inert effect of neural activity—"as the steam-whistle which accompanies the work of a locomotive engine is without influence upon its machinery".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=T. H. Huxley |author-link=T. H. Huxley |title=On the hypothesis that animals are automata, and its history |journal=The Fortnightly Review |volume=16 |issue=253 |pages=555–580|year=1874|bibcode=1874Natur..10..362. |doi=10.1038/010362a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To this [[William James]] objects in his essay ''Are We Automata?'' by stating an evolutionary argument for mind-brain interaction implying that if the preservation and development of consciousness in the biological evolution is a result of [[natural selection]], it is plausible that consciousness has not only been influenced by neural processes, but has had a survival value itself; and it could only have had this if it had been efficacious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=W. James |author-link=William James |title=Are we automata?|journal=Mind |volume=4 |pages=1–22|year=1879}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=B. I. B.

=== Animal ethics ===

[[Bernard Rollin]] of Colorado State University, the principal author of two U.S. federal laws regulating pain relief for animals, writes that researchers remained unsure into the 1980s as to whether animals experience pain, and veterinarians trained in the U.S. before 1989 were simply taught to ignore animal pain.&lt;ref name=Rollin117&gt;Rollin, Bernard.

In 1976 [[Richard Dawkins]] wrote, "The evolution of the capacity to simulate seems to have culminated in subjective consciousness. Why this should have happened is, to me, the most profound mystery facing modern biology".&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Dawkins]], [[The Selfish Gene]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, eight neuroscientists felt it was still too soon for a definition. They wrote an apology in "Human Brain Function":&lt;ref&gt;''Human Brain Function'', by Richard Frackowiak and 7 other neuroscientists, page 269 in chapter 16 "The Neural Correlates of Consciousness" (consisting of 32 pages), published 2004&lt;/ref&gt;
::"We have no idea how consciousness emerges from the physical activity of the brain and we do not know whether consciousness can emerge from non-biological systems, such as computers... At this point the reader will expect to find a careful and precise definition of consciousness. You will be disappointed. Consciousness has not yet become a scientific term that can be defined in this way. Currently we all use the term ''consciousness'' in many different and often ambiguous ways. Precise definitions of different aspects of consciousness will emerge ... but to make precise definitions at this stage is premature."

[[Consciousness]] is sometimes defined as the quality or state of being aware of an external object or something within oneself.&lt;ref name="van_Gulick2004"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=consciousness|publisher=Merriam-Webster|location=|accessdate=4 June 2012|url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/consciousness}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been defined somewhat vaguely as: [[subjectivity]], [[awareness]], [[sentience]], the ability to [[experience]] or to [[feeling|feel]], wakefulness, having a sense of [[self]]hood, and the executive control system of the mind.&lt;ref name="Farthing1992Psychology"/&gt; Despite the difficulty in definition, many philosophers believe that there is a broadly shared underlying intuition about what consciousness is.&lt;ref name="John Searle 2005"/&gt; [[Max Velmans]] and Susan Schneider wrote in ''The Blackwell Companion to Consciousness'': "Anything that we are aware of at a given moment forms part of our consciousness, making conscious experience at once the most familiar and most mysterious aspect of our lives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Susan Schneider |author2=Max Velmans |author2-link=Max Velmans |last-author-amp=yes |year=2008 |chapter=Introduction |editor=Max Velmans |editor2=Susan Schneider |title=The Blackwell Companion to Consciousness |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-0-470-75145-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Related terms, also often used in vague or ambiguous ways, are:
* [[Awareness]]: the state or ability to perceive, to feel, or to be [[conscious]] of events, [[Object (philosophy)|objects]], or sensory [[pattern]]s. In this level of consciousness, sense data can be confirmed by an observer without necessarily implying [[understanding]]. More broadly, it is the state or quality of being aware of something. In [[biological psychology]], awareness is defined as a human's or an animal's [[perception]] and [[cognitive]] reaction to a condition or event.
* [[Self-awareness]]: the capacity for [[introspection]] and the ability to reconcile oneself as an individual separate from the environment and other individuals.
* [[Self-consciousness]]: an [[Acute (medicine)|acute]] sense of self-awareness. It is a preoccupation with oneself, as opposed to the philosophical state of [[self-awareness]], which is the awareness that one exists as an individual being; although some writers use both terms interchangeably or synonymously.&lt;ref&gt;Richard P. Lipka/Thomas M. Brinthaupt ''Self-perspectives Across the Life Span'', p. 228, SUNY Press, 1992 {{ISBN|978-0-7914-1003-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Sentience]]: the ability to be aware ([[feeling|feel]], [[perception|perceive]], or be [[consciousness|conscious]]) of one's surroundings or to have subjective experiences. Sentience is a minimalistic way of defining consciousness, which is otherwise commonly used to collectively describe sentience plus other characteristics of the mind.
* [[Sapience]]: often defined as wisdom, or the ability of an organism or entity to act with appropriate [[Value judgment|judgment]], a mental faculty which is a component of [[Intelligence (trait)|intelligence]] or alternatively may be considered an additional faculty, apart from intelligence, with its own properties.
* [[Qualia]]: individual instances of [[Subjectivity|subjective]], [[consciousness|conscious experience]].

Sentience (the ability to feel, perceive, or to experience subjectivity) is not the same as self-awareness (being aware of oneself as an individual). The [[mirror test]] is sometimes considered to be an operational test for self-awareness, and the handful of animals that have passed it are often considered to be self-aware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author1=Gallup Jr GG | author2=Anderson JR | author3= Shillito DJ | year=2002 | url=http://colinallen.dnsalias.org/Secure/TCA/gallup-final.pdf | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006070539/http://colinallen.dnsalias.org/Secure/TCA/gallup-final.pdf | archivedate=6 October 2014 | chapter=The mirror test | editor1= Bekoff M | editor2= Allen C | editor3= Burghardt GM  | title=The cognitive animal: Empirical and Theoretical perspectives on animal cognition | pages=325–333 | publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haikonen POA (2007) [http://www.consciousness.it/CAI/online_papers/Haikonen.pdf "Reflections of consciousness: The mirror test"] Proceedings of the 2007 AAAI Fall ''Symposium on Consciousness'', pp. 67–71.&lt;/ref&gt; It remains debatable whether recognition of one's mirror image can be properly construed to imply full self-awareness,&lt;ref name="self-recognition"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Asendorpf | first1 = J.

==Scientific approaches==
Since [[Descartes]]'s proposal of [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]], it became a general consensus that the mind had become a matter of [[philosophy]] and that science was not able to penetrate the issue of consciousness - that consciousness was outside of space and time. However, over the last 20 years, many scholars have begun to move toward a science of consciousness. [[Antonio Damasio]] and [[Gerald Edelman]] are two neuroscientists who have led the move to neural correlates of the self and of consciousness. Damasio has demonstrated that emotions and their biological foundation play a critical role in high level cognition,&lt;ref&gt;Damasio, A. (1999). ''The Feeling of What Happens: Body, Emotion and the Making of Consciousness''. Harcourt Brace, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Damasio, A. (2003). Feelings of emotion and the self. In J. LeDoux, J. Debiec &amp; H. Moss (Eds.), Self: from Soul to Brain (Vol. 1001, pp. 253-261). New York: New York Acad Sciences.&lt;/ref&gt; and Edelman has created a framework for analyzing consciousness through a scientific outlook. The current problem consciousness researchers face involves explaining how and why consciousness arises from neural computation.&lt;ref&gt;Chalmers D J, Facing up to the problem of consciousness, J Cons Stud, 2 (1995) 200.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chalmers D J, The conscious mind: In search of a fundamental theory (Oxford University Press, New York) 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; In his research on this problem, Edelman has developed a theory of consciousness, in which he has coined the terms [[primary consciousness]] and [[secondary consciousness]].&lt;ref name="Edelman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edelman, G. M., Tononi, G. (2000). A Universe of Consciousness: How Matter Becomes Imagination. New York: Basic Books&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eugene Linden (author)|Eugene Linden]], author of ''The Parrot's Lament'' suggests there are many examples of animal behavior and intelligence that surpass what people would suppose to be the boundary of animal consciousness. Linden contends that in many of these documented examples, a variety of animal species exhibit behavior that can only be attributed to emotion, and to a level of consciousness that we would normally ascribe only to our own species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| publisher = G.K.

Philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]] counters that:
{{quote|Consciousness requires a certain kind of informational organization that does not seem to be 'hard-wired' in humans, but is instilled by human culture. Moreover, consciousness is not a black-or-white, all-or-nothing type of phenomenon, as is often assumed. The differences between humans and other species are so great that speculations about animal consciousness seem ungrounded. Many authors simply assume that an animal like a bat has a point of view, but there seems to be little interest in exploring the details involved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://instruct.westvalley.edu/lafave/dennett_anim_csness.html Animal consciousness: what matters and why] Daniel Dennett&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Consciousness in mammals (including humans) is an aspect of the mind generally thought to comprise qualities such as [[subjectivity]], [[sentience]], and the ability to [[perception|perceive]] the relationship between [[Personal identity|oneself]] and one's [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. It is a subject of much research in [[philosophy of mind]], [[psychology]], [[neuroscience]], and [[cognitive science]]. Some philosophers divide consciousness into [[phenomena]]l consciousness, which is subjective experience itself, and access consciousness, which refers to the global availability of information to processing systems in the brain.&lt;ref name=Block1995&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Block | first1 = Ned | authorlink = Ned Block | year = 1995 | title = On a confusion about a function of consciousness | url = http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/philo/faculty/block/papers/1995_Function.pdf | format = PDF | journal = The Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 18 | issue = 2| pages = 227–287 | doi=10.1017/s0140525x00038188| citeseerx = 10.1.1.207.6880 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Phenomenal consciousness has many different experienced qualities, often referred to as [[qualia]]. Phenomenal consciousness is usually consciousness ''of'' something or ''about'' something, a property known as [[intentionality]] in philosophy of mind.&lt;ref name=Block1995 /&gt;

In humans, there are three common methods of studying consciousness, i.e. verbal report, behavioural demonstrations, and neural correlation with conscious activity.  Unfortunately these can only be generalized to non-human taxa with varying degrees of difficulty.&lt;ref name="Barron2016"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Barron, A.B.|author2=Klein, C.|year=2016|title=What insects can tell us about the origins of consciousness|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=113|issue=18|pages=4900–4908|doi=10.1073/pnas.1520084113|pmid=27091981|bibcode=2016PNAS..113.4900B|pmc=4983823}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Mirror test}}

The sense in which animals (or human infants) can be said to have [[consciousness]] or a [[self-concept]] has been hotly debated; it is often referred to as the debate over animal minds. The best known research technique in this area is the [[mirror test]] devised by [[Gordon G. Gallup]], in which the skin of an animal (or human infant) is marked, while it is asleep or sedated, with a mark that cannot be seen directly but is visible in a mirror. The animal is then allowed to see its reflection in a mirror; if the animal spontaneously directs grooming behaviour towards the mark, that is taken as an indication that it is aware of itself.&lt;ref&gt;Bischof-Köhler, D.

Until recently it was thought that self-recognition was absent from animals without a [[neocortex]], and was restricted to mammals with large brains and well developed social cognition. However, in 2008 a study of self-recognition in [[corvids]] reported significant results for magpies. Mammals and birds inherited the same brain components from their last common [[ancestor]] nearly 300 million years ago, and have since independently evolved and formed significantly different brain types. The results of the mirror and mark tests showed that neocortex-less [[magpies]] are capable of understanding that a mirror image belongs to their own body. The findings show that magpies respond in the mirror and mark test in a manner similar to apes, dolphins and elephants. This is a remarkable capability that, although not fully concrete in its determination of self-recognition, is at least a prerequisite of self-recognition. This is not only of interest regarding the convergent evolution of social intelligence; it is also valuable for an understanding of the general principles that govern cognitive evolution and their underlying neural mechanisms. The magpies were chosen to study based on their empathy/lifestyle, a possible precursor for their ability of self-awareness.&lt;ref name="Magpie"/&gt; However even in the chimpanzee, the species most studied and with the most convincing findings, clear-cut evidence of self-recognition is not obtained in all individuals tested.

Another approach to determine whether a non-human animal is conscious derives from passive speech research with a macaw (see [[Talking Birds#Arielle|Arielle]]). Some researchers propose that by passively listening to an animal's voluntary speech, it is possible to learn about the thoughts of another creature and to determine that the speaker is conscious. This type of research was originally used to investigate a child's [[crib talk|crib speech]] by Weir (1962) and in investigations of early speech in children by Greenfield and others (1976).

[[Zipf's law]] might be able to be used to indicate if a given dataset of animal communication indicate an intelligent natural language. Some researchers have used this algorithm to study bottlenose dolphin language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ee.columbia.edu/~xanadu/papers/suzuki05.pdf|title=The use of Zipf's law in animal communication analysis|last1=Suzuki|first1=Ryuji|last2=Buck|first2=John|last3=Tyack|first3=Peter|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=69|issue=1|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2004.08.004|date=January 2005|pages=F9–F17|citeseerx=10.1.1.112.5869}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pain or suffering===
{{see also|Pain in animals}}

Further arguments revolve around the ability of animals to feel [[pain]] or [[suffering]]. Suffering implies consciousness. If animals can be shown to suffer in a way similar or identical to humans, many of the arguments against human suffering could then, presumably, be extended to animals. Others have argued that pain can be demonstrated by adverse reactions to negative stimuli that are non-purposeful or even maladaptive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Carter | first1 = Alan | year = 2005 | title = Animals, Pain and Morality | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Philosophy | volume = 22 | issue = 1| pages = 17–22 | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-5930.2005.00289.x | pmid = 15948329 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One such reaction is [[transmarginal inhibition]], a phenomenon observed in humans and some animals akin to [[mental breakdown]].

[[Carl Sagan]], the American cosmologist, points to reasons why humans have had a tendency to deny animals can suffer:
{{quote|Humans – who enslave, castrate, experiment on, and fillet other animals – have had an understandable penchant for pretending animals do not feel pain. A sharp distinction between humans and 'animals' is essential if we are to bend them to our will, make them work for us, wear them, eat them – without any disquieting tinges of guilt or regret. It is unseemly of us, who often behave so unfeelingly toward other animals, to contend that only humans can suffer. The behavior of other animals renders such pretensions specious. They are just too much like us.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Sagan|Sagan, Carl]] and [[Ann Druyan]] (1993) ''Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors'', Ballantine Books. {{ISBN|9780345384720}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

John Webster, a professor of animal husbandry at Bristol, argues:
{{quote|People have assumed that intelligence is linked to the ability to suffer and that because animals have smaller brains they suffer less than humans. That is a pathetic piece of logic, sentient animals have the capacity to experience pleasure and are motivated to seek it, you only have to watch how cows and lambs both seek and enjoy pleasure when they lie with their heads raised to the sun on a perfect English summer's day. Just like humans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-1502933,00.html The secret life of moody cows] John Webster&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, there is no agreement where the line between organisms that can feel pain and those that cannot should be drawn. [[Justin Leiber]], a philosophy professor at [[Oxford University]] writes that:
{{quote|[[Montaigne]] is ecumenical in this respect, claiming consciousness for spiders and ants, and even writing of our duties to trees and plants. [[Peter Singer|Singer]] and [[Samuel Clarke|Clarke]] agree in denying consciousness to sponges. Singer locates the distinction somewhere between the shrimp and the oyster. He, with rather considerable convenience for one who is thundering hard accusations at others, slides by the case of insects and spiders and bacteria, they pace Montaigne, apparently and rather conveniently do not feel pain. The intrepid [[Midgley]], on the other hand, seems willing to speculate about the subjective experience of tapeworms ...[[Thomas Nagel|Nagel]] ... appears to draw the line at flounders and wasps, though more recently he speaks of the inner life of cockroaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leiber | first1 = Justin | date = December 1988 | title = Cartesian Linguistics? | journal = [[Philosophia (journal)|Philosophia]] | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 309–46 | doi=10.1007/BF02380646}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There are also some who reject the argument entirely, arguing that although suffering animals feel anguish, a suffering plant also struggles to stay alive (albeit in a less visible way). In fact, no living organism 'wants' to die for another organism's sustenance. In an article written for ''[[The New York Times]]'', Carol Kaesuk Yoon argues that:

{{quote|When a plant is wounded, its body immediately kicks into protection mode. It releases a bouquet of volatile chemicals, which in some cases have been shown to induce neighboring plants to pre-emptively step up their own chemical defenses and in other cases to lure in predators of the beasts that may be causing the damage to the plants. Inside the plant, repair systems are engaged and defenses are mounted, the molecular details of which scientists are still working out, but which involve signaling molecules coursing through the body to rally the cellular troops, even the enlisting of the genome itself, which begins churning out defense-related proteins ... If you think about it, though, why would we expect any organism to lie down and die for our dinner? Organisms have evolved to do everything in their power to avoid being extinguished. How long would any lineage be likely to last if its members effectively didn't care if you killed them? &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/15/science/15food.html?pagewanted=all No Face, but Plants Like Life Too] Carol Kaesuk Yoon, ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Cognitive bias and emotion===

The neuroscientist [[Joseph LeDoux]] advocates avoiding terms derived from human subjective experience when discussing brain functions in animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = LeDoux | first1 = J | year = 2012 | title = Rethinking the emotional brain | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627312001298 | journal = Neuron | volume = 73 | issue = 4| pages = 653–676 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuron.2012.02.004 | pmid = 22365542 | pmc = 3625946 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the common practice of calling brain circuits that detect and respond to threats "fear circuits" implies that these circuits are responsible for feelings of fear. LeDoux argues that Pavlovian fear conditioning should be renamed Pavlovian threat conditioning to avoid the implication that "fear" is being acquired in rats or humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = LeDoux | first1 = JE | year = 2014 | title = Coming to terms with fear | url = http://www.pnas.org/content/111/8/2871.full | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | volume = 111 | issue = 8| pages = 2871–2878 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1400335111 | pmid = 24501122 | bibcode = 2014PNAS..111.2871L | pmc = 3939902 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Key to his theoretical change is the notion of survival functions mediated by survival circuits, the purpose of which is to keep organisms alive rather than to make emotions. For example, defensive survival circuits exist to detect and respond to threats. While all organisms can do this, only organisms that can be conscious of their own brain’s activities can feel fear. Fear is a conscious experience and occurs the same way as any other kind of conscious experience: via cortical circuits that allow attention to certain forms of brain activity. LeDoux argues the only differences between an emotional and non-emotion state of consciousness are the underlying neural ingredients that contribute to the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = LeDoux | first1 = JE | year = 2015 | title = Feelings: What are they &amp; how does the brain make them? | url = http://www.cns.nyu.edu/home/LeDoux/pdf/daed_LeDoux_2015.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Daedalus | volume = 144 | issue = 1| pages = 96–111 | doi = 10.1162/DAED_a_00319 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;LeDoux JE (2015) [https://books.google.com/books?id=mg0bBQAAQBAJ&amp;dq=%22Anxious:+Using+the+Brain+to+Understand+and+Treat+Fear+and+Anxiety%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAGoVChMIiZ7s26KZxwIVZnumCh09Zwvy ''Anxious: Using the Brain to Understand and Treat Fear and Anxiety''], Penguin Publishing Group. {{ISBN|9781101619940}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neuroscience===
[[File:PurkinjeCell.jpg|right|thumb|Drawing by [[Santiago Ramón y Cajal]] (1899) of [[neuron]]s in the pigeon cerebellum]]

[[Neuroscience]] is the scientific study of the [[nervous system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Neuroscience|work=Merriam-Webster Medical Dictionary|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/medlineplus/neuroscience}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a highly active [[interdisciplinary]] science that collaborates with many other fields. The scope of neuroscience has broadened recently to include [[molecular biology|molecular]], [[cellular neuroscience|cellular]], [[neural development|developmental]], [[neuroanatomy|structural]], [[neurophysiology|functional]], [[evolutionary neuroscience|evolutionary]], [[computational neuroscience|computational]], and [[neurological disorders|medical]] aspects of the nervous system. Theoretical studies of [[neural network]]s are being complemented with techniques for [[brain mapping|imaging]] sensory and motor tasks in the [[brain]].
According to a 2008 paper, neuroscience explanations of psychological phenomena currently have a "seductive allure", and "seem to generate more public interest" than explanations which do not contain neuroscientific information.&lt;ref name=Weisberg2008&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weisberg | first1 = DS | last2 = Keil | first2 = FC | last3 = Goodstein | first3 = J | last4 = Rawson | first4 = E | last5 = Gray | first5 = JR | year = 2008 | title = The seductive allure of neuroscience explanations | journal = Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 470–477 | doi = 10.1162/jocn.2008.20040 | pmc=2778755 | pmid=18004955}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found that subjects who were not neuroscience experts "judged that explanations with logically irrelevant neuroscience information were more satisfying than explanations without.&lt;ref name=Weisberg2008 /&gt;

====Neural correlates====
{{see also|Neural correlates of consciousness}}

The [[neural correlates of consciousness]] constitute the minimal set of neuronal events and mechanisms sufficient for a specific conscious [[Perception#Process and terminology|percept]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Koch2004|Koch 2004]], p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt; Neuroscientists use empirical approaches to discover [[neural correlate]]s of subjective phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.klab.caltech.edu/~koch/glossary.html here] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313192029/http://www.klab.caltech.edu/~koch/glossary.html |date=13 March 2013 }} for a glossary of related terms.&lt;/ref&gt; The set should be ''minimal'' because, if the brain is sufficient to give rise to any given conscious experience, the question is which of its components is necessary to produce it.

Visual sense and representation was reviewed in 1998 by [[Francis Crick]] and [[Christof Koch]]. They concluded [[sensory neuroscience]] can be used as a bottom-up approach to studying consciousness, and suggested experiments to test various hypotheses in this research stream.&lt;ref name="Crick 1998"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Crick| first1=F.| last2=Koch| first2=C.| title=Consciousness and neuroscience| journal=Cereb Cortex| volume=8 | issue=2 | pages=97–107 |date=1998 | doi= 10.1093/cercor/8.2.97| pmid=9542889 }} [http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/content/8/2/97.long Full text].&lt;/ref&gt;

A feature that distinguishes humans from most animals is that we are not born with an extensive repertoire of behavioral programs that would enable us to survive on our own ("[[physiological prematurity]]"). To compensate for this, we have an unmatched ability to learn, i.e., to consciously acquire such programs by imitation or exploration. Once consciously acquired and sufficiently exercised, these programs can become automated to the extent that their execution happens beyond the realms of our awareness. Take, as an example, the incredible fine motor skills exerted in playing a Beethoven piano sonata or the sensorimotor coordination required to ride a motorcycle along a curvy mountain road. Such complex behaviors are possible only because a sufficient number of the subprograms involved can be executed with minimal or even suspended conscious control. In fact, the conscious system may actually interfere somewhat with these automated programs.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Beilock2002|Beilock et al. 2002]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The growing ability of neuroscientists to manipulate neurons using methods from molecular biology in combination with optical tools depends on the simultaneous development of appropriate behavioural assays and model organisms amenable to large-scale genomic analysis and manipulation.&lt;ref&gt;Adamantidis A.R., Zhang F., Aravanis A.M., Deisseroth K. and de Lecea L. (2007) "Neural substrates of awakening probed with optogenetic control of hypocretin neurons". ''Nature''.&lt;/ref&gt; A combination of such fine-grained neuronal analysis in animals with ever more sensitive psychophysical and brain imaging techniques in humans, complemented by the development of a robust theoretical predictive framework, will hopefully lead to a rational understanding of consciousness.

====Neocortex====
[[File:Taeniopygia guttata -Karratha, Pilbara, Western Australia, Australia -male-8 (2).jpg|thumb|right|Previously researchers had thought that patterns of neural sleep exhibited by [[zebra finch]]es needed a mammalian [[neocortex]]&lt;ref name=CDC /&gt;]]

The [[neocortex]] is a part of the brain of mammals. It consists of the [[grey matter]], or neuronal cell bodies and [[myelin|unmyelinated]] fibers, surrounding the deeper [[white matter]] ([[myelin]]ated [[axon]]s) in the [[cerebrum]]. The neocortex is smooth in [[rodent]]s and other small mammals, whereas in [[primate]]s and other larger mammals it has deep grooves and wrinkles. These folds increase the surface area of the neocortex considerably without taking up too much more volume. Also, neurons within the same wrinkle have more opportunity for connectivity, while neurons in different wrinkles have less opportunity for connectivity, leading to compartmentalization of the cortex. The neocortex is divided into [[frontal lobe|frontal]], [[parietal lobe|parietal]], [[occipital lobe|occipital]], and [[temporal lobe|temporal]] lobes, which perform different functions. For example, the occipital lobe contains the [[primary visual cortex]], and the temporal lobe contains the [[primary auditory cortex]]. Further subdivisions or areas of neocortex are responsible for more specific cognitive processes. The neocortex is the newest part of the [[cerebral cortex]] to evolve (hence the prefix "neo"); the other parts of the cerebral cortex are the [[paleocortex]] and [[archicortex]], collectively known as the [[allocortex]]. In humans, 90% of the cerebral cortex is neocortex.

Researchers have argued that consciousness arises in the neocortex, and therefore cannot arise in animals which lack a neocortex. For example, Rose argued in 2002 that the "fishes have nervous systems that mediate effective escape and avoidance responses to noxious stimuli, but, these responses must occur without a concurrent, human-like awareness of pain, suffering or distress, which depend on separately evolved neocortex."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rose |first1=James D |year=2002 |title=The neurobehavioral nature of fishes and the question of awareness and pain |url=http://www.nal.usda.gov/awic/pubs/Fishwelfare/Rose.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Reviews in Fisheries Science |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=1–38 |doi=10.1080/20026491051668 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010181101/http://www.nal.usda.gov/awic/pubs/Fishwelfare/Rose.pdf |archivedate=10 October 2012 |df=dmy|citeseerx=10.1.1.598.8119 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently that view has been challenged, and many researchers now believe that animal consciousness can arise from [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] [[subcortical]] brain networks.&lt;ref name=CDC /&gt;

====Attention====
[[Attention]] is the [[cognitive process]] of selectively concentrating on one aspect of the environment while ignoring other things. Attention has also been referred to as the allocation of processing resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Anderson |first=John R. |authorlink=John Robert Anderson (psychologist) |year=2004 |title=Cognitive psychology and its implications |edition=6th |publisher=Worth Publishers |url= https://books.google.com/?id=9P4p6eAULMoC |isbn=978-0-7167-0110-1 |page=519}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attention also has variations amongst cultures. Voluntary attention develops in specific cultural and institutional contexts through engagement in cultural activities with more competent community members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chavajay|first=Pablo|author2=Barbara Rogoff|title=Cultural variation in management of attention by children and their caregivers|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=1999|volume=35|issue=4|pages=1079–1090|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.35.4.1079|pmid=10442876}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most experiments show that one [[neural correlate]] of attention is enhanced firing. If a neuron has a certain response to a stimulus when the animal is not attending to the stimulus, then when the animal does attend to the stimulus, the neuron's response will be enhanced even if the physical characteristics of the stimulus remain the same. In many cases attention produces changes in the [[EEG]]. Many animals, including humans, produce [[gamma wave]]s (40–60&amp;nbsp;Hz) when focusing attention on a particular object or activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kaiser J, Lutzenberger W |title=Induced gamma-band activity and human brain function |journal=Neuroscientist |volume=9 |pages=475–84 |year=2003 |pmid=14678580 |doi=10.1177/1073858403259137 |issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Extended consciousness====
[[Extended consciousness]] is an animal's autobiographical self-perception. It is thought to arise in the brains of animals which have a substantial capacity for memory and reason. It does not necessarily require language. The perception of a historic and future self arises from a stream of information from the immediate environment and from neural structures related to memory. The concept was popularised by [[Antonio Damasio]] and is used in [[biological psychology]]. Extended consciousness is said to arise in structures in the [[human brain]] described as ''image spaces'' and ''dispositional spaces''. Image spaces imply areas where [[senses|sensory]] impressions of all types are processed, including the focused awareness of the [[core consciousness]]. Dispositional spaces include convergence zones, which are networks in the brain where memories are processed and recalled, and where knowledge is merged with immediate experience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.creativitycountry.net.au/creativity/consciousness.htm 'Layers' or 'levels' of consciousness?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410002602/http://creativitycountry.net.au/creativity/consciousness.htm |date=10 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,32273,00.html Time Magazine 1999 'Mystery Of Consciousness']&lt;/ref&gt;

''Evolutionary Analysis.'' 2007. Pearson Education, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt; Opinions are divided as to where in biological [[evolution]] consciousness emerged and about whether or not consciousness has survival value. It has been argued that consciousness emerged (i) exclusively with the first humans, (ii) exclusively with the first mammals, (iii) independently in mammals and birds, or (iv) with the first reptiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Peter Århem |author2=B.

In his paper "Evolution of consciousness," [[John Eccles (neurophysiologist)|John Eccles]] argues that special anatomical and physical adaptations of the mammalian [[cerebral cortex]] gave rise to consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | jstor = 2360081 | pages = 7320–7324 | last1 = Eccles | first1 = J.

Baars]].&lt;ref&gt;Baars, Bernard J. ''A Cognitive Theory of Consciousness.'' 1993. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Dawkins]] suggested that humans evolved consciousness in order to make themselves the subjects of thought.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 5"&gt;Gaulin, Steven J. C. and Donald H. McBurney (2003) ''Evolutionary psychology''. Prentice Hall, pp. 101–121. {{ISBN|978-0-13-111529-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel Povinelli suggests that large, tree-climbing apes evolved consciousness to take into account one's own mass when moving safely among tree branches.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 5"/&gt; Consistent with this hypothesis, [[Gordon Gallup]] found that chimps and orangutans, but not little monkeys or terrestrial gorillas, demonstrated [[self-awareness]] in mirror tests.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 5"/&gt;

The concept of consciousness can refer to voluntary action, awareness, or wakefulness. However, even voluntary behaviour involves unconscious mechanisms. Many cognitive processes take place in the cognitive unconscious, unavailable to conscious awareness. Some behaviours are conscious when learned but then become unconscious, seemingly automatic. Learning, especially implicitly learning a skill, can take place outside of consciousness. For example, plenty of people know how to turn right when they ride a bike, but very few can accurately explain how they actually do so.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 5"/&gt;

===Neural Darwinism===
{{main|Neural Darwinism}}

[[Neural Darwinism]] is a large scale theory of brain function initially proposed in 1978 by the American biologist [[Gerald Edelman]].&lt;ref&gt;Seth, A.K. and Baars, B.J. (2005) "Neural Darwinism and consciousness". ''Consciousness and Cognition'', '''14''' (1): 140–168. {{doi|10.1016/j.concog.2004.08.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edelman distinguishes between what he calls primary and secondary consciousness:

* [[Primary consciousness]]: is the ability, found in humans and some animals, to integrate observed events with memory to create an [[awareness]] of the present and immediate past of the world around them. This form of consciousness is also sometimes called "sensory consciousness". Put another way, primary consciousness is the presence of various [[subjectivity|subjective]] sensory contents of consciousness such as [[sensation (psychology)|sensation]]s, [[perception]]s, and mental images. For example, primary consciousness includes a person's experience of the blueness of the ocean, a bird's song, and the feeling of pain. Thus, primary consciousness refers to being mentally aware of things in the world in the present without any sense of past and future; it is composed of mental images bound to a time around the measurable present.&lt;ref name = Edelmansky&gt;Edelman, G. (2004). ''Wider than the sky: The phenomenal gift of consciousness'': Yale Univ Pr.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Secondary consciousness]]: is an individual's accessibility to their history and plans. The concept is also loosely and commonly associated with having awareness of one's own [[consciousness]]. The ability allows its possessors to go beyond the limits of the remembered present of [[primary consciousness]].&lt;ref name="Edelman"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Edelman | first1 = G. M. | year = 2003 | title = Naturalizing consciousness: a theoretical framework | url = | journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. | volume = 100 | issue = 9| pages = 5520–5524 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0931349100| pmid = 12702758 | bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.5520E | pmc = 154377}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Primary consciousness can be defined as simple awareness that includes [[perception]] and [[emotion]]. As such, it is ascribed to most animals. By contrast, secondary consciousness depends on and includes such features as self-reflective awareness, [[abstract thinking]], [[Volition (psychology)|volition]] and [[metacognition]].&lt;ref name="Edelman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edelman, G. M. (1992). Bright Air, Brilliant Fire: On the Matter of the Mind. Basic Books, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

Edelman's theory focuses on two [[nervous system]] organizations: the [[brainstem]] and [[limbic system]]s on one side and the [[thalamus]] and [[cerebral cortex]] on the other side. The brain stem and limbic system take care of essential body functioning and survival, while the thalamocortical system receives signals from sensory receptors and sends out signals to voluntary muscles such as those of the arms and legs. The theory asserts that the connection of these two systems during evolution helped animals learn [[adaptive behavior]]s.&lt;ref name = Edelmansky/&gt;

Other scientists have argued against Edelman's theory, instead suggesting that primary consciousness might have emerged with the basic vegetative systems of the brain. That is, the evolutionary origin might have come from sensations and primal emotions arising from [[sensory neuron|sensors]] and [[sensory receptors|receptors]], both internal and surface, signaling that the well-being of the creature was immediately threatened—for example, hunger for air, thirst, hunger, pain, and extreme temperature change. This is based on neurological data showing the [[thalamus|thalamic]], [[hippocampus|hippocampal]], [[orbitofrontal cortex|orbitofrontal]], [[insular cortex|insula]], and [[midbrain]] sites are the key to consciousness of thirst.&lt;ref name = Merker&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Merker | first1 = B | year = 2007 | title = Consciousness without a cerebral cortex: A challenge for neuroscience and medicine | url = | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 30 | issue = 1| pages = 63–81 | doi=10.1017/s0140525x07000891| pmid = 17475053 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These scientists also point out that the cortex might not be as important to primary consciousness as some neuroscientists have believed.&lt;ref name = Merker/&gt; Evidence of this lies in the fact that studies show that systematically disabling parts of the cortex in animals does not remove consciousness. Another study found that children born without a cortex are conscious. Instead of cortical mechanisms, these scientists emphasize brainstem mechanisms as essential to consciousness.&lt;ref name = Merker/&gt; Still, these scientists concede that higher order consciousness does involve the cortex and complex communication between different areas of the brain.

While animals with [[primary consciousness]] have long-term memory, they lack explicit narrative, and, at best, can only deal with the immediate scene in the remembered present. While they still have an advantage over animals lacking such ability, evolution has brought forth a growing complexity in consciousness, particularly in mammals. Animals with this complexity are said to have secondary consciousness.
Secondary consciousness is seen in animals with [[semantic]] capabilities, such as the four [[great apes]]. It is present in its richest form in the human species, which is unique in possessing complex [[language]] made up of [[syntax]] and semantics. In considering how the neural mechanisms underlying primary consciousness arose and were maintained during evolution, it is proposed that at some time around the divergence of [[reptiles]] into mammals and then into [[birds]], the [[embryological]] development of large numbers of new reciprocal connections allowed rich [[Reentry (neural circuitry)|re-entrant]] activity to take place between the more posterior brain systems carrying out perceptual categorization and the more frontally located systems responsible for value-category memory.&lt;ref name="Edelman"/&gt; The ability of an animal to relate a present complex scene to its own previous history of learning conferred an adaptive evolutionary advantage. At much later evolutionary epochs, further re-entrant circuits appeared that linked semantic and linguistic performance to categorical and conceptual [[memory]] systems. This development enabled the emergence of secondary consciousness.&lt;ref name="Sky"&gt;Edelman, G. M. (2004). Wider than the sky: a revolutionary view of consciousness. Penguin Press Science, London, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edelman, G. M. (200). Second Nature:Brain Science and Human Knowledge. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ursula Voss of the [[Universität Bonn]] believes that the theory of [[protoconsciousness]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hobson |first1=J. A. |year=2009 |title=REM sleep and dreaming: towards a theory of protoconsciousness |url=http://194.80.240.74/images/events/REM%20Sleep%20and%20Dreaming.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience |volume=10 |issue=11 |pages=803–862 |doi=10.1038/nrn2716 |pmid=19794431 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; may serve as adequate explanation for self-recognition found in birds, as they would develop secondary consciousness during REM sleep.&lt;ref name="Voss"&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Voss | first1 = Ursula | year = 2010 | title = Changes in EEG pre and post awakening | volume = 93 | issue = | pages = 23–56 | doi = 10.1016/S0074-7742(10)93002-X | pmid = 20970000 | series = International Review of Neurobiology | isbn = 9780123813244 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She added that many types of birds have very sophisticated language systems. Don Kuiken of the University of Alberta finds such research interesting as well as if we continue to study consciousness with animal models (with differing types of consciousness), we would be able to separate the different forms of reflectiveness found in today's world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kuiken | first1 = Don | year = 2010 | title = Primary and secondary consciousness during dreaming | url = http://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/ojs/index.php/IJoDR/article/download/594/pdf_17 | journal = International Journal of Dream Research | volume = 3 | issue = 1| pages = 21–25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the advocates of the idea of a secondary consciousness, [[self-recognition]] serves as a critical component and a key defining measure. What is most interesting then, is the evolutionary appeal that arises with the concept of self-recognition. In non-human species and in children, the [[mirror test]] (see above) has been used as an indicator of [[self-awareness]].

In 2012, a group of neuroscientists attending a conference on "Consciousness in Human and non-Human Animals" at the [[University of Cambridge]] in the UK, signed ''The Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness'' (see box on the right).&lt;ref name=CDC&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131109230457/http://fcmconference.org/img/CambridgeDeclarationOnConsciousness.pdf The Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness (Archive)] 7 July 2012.

In the accompanying text they "unequivocally" asserted:&lt;ref name=CDC /&gt;

:* "The field of Consciousness research is rapidly evolving. Abundant new techniques and strategies for human and non-human animal research have been developed. Consequently, more data is becoming readily available, and this calls for a periodic reevaluation of previously held preconceptions in this field. Studies of non-human animals have shown that [[homology (biology)|homologous]] brain circuits correlated with conscious experience and perception can be selectively facilitated and disrupted to assess whether they are in fact necessary for those experiences. Moreover, in humans, new non-invasive techniques are readily available to survey the [[Neural correlates of consciousness|correlates of consciousness]]."&lt;ref name=CDC /&gt;

:* "The [[neural substrate]]s of emotions do not appear to be confined to cortical structures. In fact, [[subcortical]] neural networks aroused during affective states in humans are also critically important for generating emotional behaviors in animals. Artificial arousal of the same brain regions generates corresponding behavior and feeling states in both humans and non-human animals. Wherever in the brain one evokes instinctual emotional behaviors in non-human animals, many of the ensuing behaviors are consistent with experienced feeling states, including those internal states that are rewarding and punishing. Deep brain stimulation of these systems in humans can also generate similar affective states. Systems associated with affect are concentrated in subcortical regions where neural [[Homology (biology)|homologies]] abound. Young human and non-human animals without neocortices retain these brain-mind functions. Furthermore, [[neural circuit]]s supporting behavioral/electrophysiological states of attentiveness, sleep and decision making appear to have arisen in evolution as early as the invertebrate radiation, being evident in insects and cephalopod mollusks (e.g., octopus)."&lt;ref name=CDC /&gt;

:* "Birds appear to offer, in their behavior, neurophysiology, and neuroanatomy a striking case of [[parallel evolution]] of consciousness. Evidence of near human-like levels of consciousness has been most dramatically observed in [[grey parrot]]s. Mammalian and avian emotional networks and cognitive microcircuitries appear to be far more homologous than previously thought. Moreover, certain species of birds have been found to exhibit neural [[sleep pattern]]s similar to those of mammals, including REM sleep and, as was demonstrated in [[zebra finch]]es, neurophysiological patterns previously thought to require a mammalian neocortex. [[Magpie]]s in particular have been shown to exhibit striking similarities to humans, great apes, dolphins, and elephants in studies of [[Mirror test|mirror self-recognition]]."&lt;ref name=CDC /&gt;

:* "In humans, the effect of certain [[hallucinogen]]s appears to be associated with a disruption in cortical [[Feedforward, Behavioral and Cognitive Science|feedforward]] and feedback processing. Pharmacological interventions in non-human animals with compounds known to affect conscious behavior in humans can lead to similar perturbations in behavior in non-human animals. In humans, there is evidence to suggest that awareness is correlated with cortical activity, which does not exclude possible contributions by subcortical or early cortical processing, as in visual awareness. Evidence that human and non-human animal emotional feelings arise from homologous subcortical brain networks provide compelling evidence for evolutionarily shared primal affective qualia."&lt;ref name=CDC /&gt;

Dogs were previously listed as non-self-aware animals. Traditionally, self-consciousness was evaluated via the [[mirror test]]. But dogs and many other animals, are not (as) visually oriented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Crew |first1=Bec |title=Dogs Show Signs of Self-Consciousness in New 'Sniff Test' |url=https://www.sciencealert.com/it-s-official-dogs-pass-the-test-of-consciousness |website=ScienceAlert |language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Coren |first1=Stanley |title=How Dogs Think |date=2008 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=9781847397065 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=22L762lV4KgC&amp;pg=PT39&amp;lpg=PT39&amp;dq=dogs+are+not+visually+oriented#v=onepage&amp;q=dogs%20are%20not%20visually%20oriented&amp;f=false |accessdate=8 July 2018 |language=en |quote="The important thing to remember is that dogs are not as visually oriented as humans"}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 study claims that the “sniff test of self-recognition” (STSR) provides significant evidence of self-awareness in dogs, and could play a crucial role in showing that this capacity is not a specific feature of only great apes, humans and a few other animals, but it depends on the way in which researchers try to verify it. According to the biologist Roberto Cazzolla Gatti (who published the study), "the innovative approach to test the self-awareness with a smell test highlights the need to shift the paradigm of the anthropocentric idea of consciousness to a species-specific perspective".&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.tsu.ru/news/dogs-and-probably-many-other-animals-have-a-conscience-too/|title=Dogs (and probably many other animals) have a conscience too!|website=en.tsu.ru|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This study has been confirmed by another study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dogs have self-awareness.

====Grey Parrots====
Research with captive [[grey parrot]]s, especially [[Irene Pepperberg]]'s work with an individual named [[Alex (parrot)|Alex]], has demonstrated they possess the ability to associate simple human words with meanings, and to intelligently apply the abstract concepts of shape, colour, number, zero-sense, etc. According to Pepperberg and other scientists, they perform many cognitive tasks at the level of dolphins, chimpanzees, and even human [[toddlers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uA9szbR7p_wC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Alex+Studies:+Cognitive+and+Communicative+Abilities+of+Grey+Parrots#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Alex Studies: cognitive and communicative abilities of grey parrots|last=PEPPERBERG|first=Irene M.|last2=Pepperberg|first2=Irene M.|date=2009-06-30|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674041998|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another notable African grey is [[N'kisi]], which in 2004 was said to have a vocabulary of over 950 words which she used in creative ways.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sheldrake.org/nkisi/nkisi1_text.html Nkisi Audio Text 1]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when [[Jane Goodall]] visited N'kisi in his New York home, he greeted her with "Got a chimp?" because he had seen pictures of her with chimpanzees in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.projo.com/ri/hopkinton/content/JANE_GOODALL08_05-08-08_RJA2H78_v81.37330d1.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629042353/http://www.projo.com/ri/hopkinton/content/JANE_GOODALL08_05-08-08_RJA2H78_v81.37330d1.html |title=Jane Goodall attends opening of bird sanctuary |date=8 May 2008 |author=Maria Armental |archive-date=29 June 2011 |website=www.projo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, research led by Dalila Bovet of [[Paris West University Nanterre La Défense]], demonstrated grey parrots were able to coordinate and collaborate with each other to an extent. They were able to solve problems such as two birds having to pull strings at the same time to obtain food. In another example, one bird stood on a perch to release a food-laden tray, while the other pulled the tray out from the test apparatus. Both would then feed. The birds were observed waiting for their partners to perform the necessary actions so their behaviour could be synchronized. The parrots appeared to express individual preferences as to which of the other test birds they would work with.&lt;ref name=gill&gt;{{cite web |last=Gill |first=Victoria |title=Parrots choose to work together |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/12913981 |publisher=BBC Nature News |accessdate=19 May 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520092257/http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/12913981| archivedate=20 May 2011 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Corvids====
[[File:Magpie in Madrid (Spain) 87b.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Eurasian magpie]] passes the [[mirror test]]]]
It was recently thought that self-recognition was restricted to mammals with large brains and highly evolved social cognition, but absent from animals without a [[neocortex]]. However, in 2008, an investigation of self-recognition in [[corvids]] was conducted revealing the ability of self-recognition in the magpie. Mammals and birds inherited the same brain components from their last common [[ancestor]] nearly 300 million years ago, and have since independently evolved and formed significantly different brain types. The results of the mirror test showed that although [[magpies]] do not have a neocortex, they are capable of understanding that a mirror image belongs to their own body. The findings show that magpies respond in the mirror test in a manner similar to apes, dolphins, killer whales, pigs and elephants. This is a remarkable capability that, although not fully concrete in its determination of self-recognition, is at least a prerequisite of self-recognition. This is not only of interest regarding the convergent evolution of social intelligence, it is also valuable for an understanding of the general principles that govern cognitive evolution and their underlying neural mechanisms. The magpies were chosen to study based on their empathy/lifestyle, a possible precursor for their ability of self-awareness.&lt;ref name="Magpie"/&gt;

===Invertebrates===
[[File:Octopus shell.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Octopus]] travelling with shells collected for protection]]
{{see also|Cephalopod intelligence|Pain in invertebrates}}

[[Octopus]]es are highly intelligent, possibly more so than any other order of [[invertebrate]]s. The level of their intelligence and learning capability are debated,&lt;ref name = "ham"/&gt;&lt;ref name="doug"&gt;[http://www.nwf.org/nationalwildlife/article.cfm?articleId=604&amp;issueId=53 NFW.org?], Is the octopus really the invertebrate intellect of the sea, by Doug Stewart.

Octopus have a highly complex [[nervous system]], only part of which is localized in their [[brain]]. Two-thirds of an octopus' [[neuron]]s are found in the nerve cords of their arms. Octopus arms show a variety of complex [[reflex]] actions that persist even when they have no input from the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yekutieli | first1 = Yoram | last2 = Sagiv-Zohar | first2 = Roni | last3 = Aharonov | first3 = Ranit | last4 = Enge | first4 = Yaakov | last5 = Hochner | first5 = Binyamin | last6 = Flash | first6 = Tamar | year = 2005 | title = Dynamic Model of the Octopus Arm.

Community '''assembly rules''' are a set of controversial rules in [[ecology]], first proposed by [[Jared Diamond]].&lt;ref name="Diamond1975"&gt;{{cite book |title=Ecology and Evolution of Communities |editor=Cody ML, Diamond JM |publisher=Belknap Press, [[Harvard University Press]] |location=Cambridge, MA |year=1975 |url=http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674224445 |pages=342&amp;ndash;444}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules==

The rules were developed after more than a decade of research into the avian assemblages on islands near [[New Guinea]]. The rules assert that competition is responsible for determining the patterns of assemblage composition.  Diamond's paper sparked nearly two decades worth of controversy in the literature, from the late seventies through the late nineties{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} and is considered a turning point in community ecology{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}. The disagreement continues to this day.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

===Rule 1: Forbidden species combinations===
The first rule is "forbidden species combinations". Diamond's hypothesis was that competition, not random immigration, was the main force structuring the species composition of islands.

So for example, the [[Bismarck black myzomela]] (''Myzomela pammelaena'') excludes the [[black sunbird]] (''Nectarinia sericea''). The Bismarck black myzomela lives on 23 of the 41 surveyed islands in the Bismarck Archipelago, but not on any of the 14 islands inhabited by the black sunbird. The two birds are about the same size, and both use their curved bills to sip nectar; Diamond argued that competition affects their distribution.&lt;ref&gt;Erik Stokstad (2009) 'On the Origin of Ecological Structure', ''Science'' 2 Oct 2009 pp. 33&amp;ndash;35.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rule 2: Reduced niche overlap===

Case tested the assembly rule that species occurring together on islands should have less [[Ecological niche|niche]] overlap than random assemblages because they have undergone specialization.&lt;ref name="Ted1983"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Case |first=Ted |year=1983 |title=Niche overlap and the assembly of island lizard communities |jstor=3544102 |journal=Oikos |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=427&amp;ndash;433 |doi=10.2307/3544102}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His study measured niche overlap of lizards on 37 islands near [[Baja California]] and compared niche overlap to the median niche overlap of computer generated random species assemblages. Case found that 30 of the 37 islands had lower niche overlap than the random assemblages and that some of the competition is due to [[interspecific competition]].

==Testing==
Testing the assembly rules is a complex process that often uses computer simulations to compare experimental data with characteristics of random assemblages of species.  The rules are generally regarded as hypotheses that need to be tested on an individual basis, not as accepted conclusions.

==Alternative theory==

As a reaction to the assembly rules controversy, ecologist [[Stephen Hubbell]] proposed that the abundance and diversity of species in a community is determined mainly by random dispersal, speciation, and extinction. This came to be known as the [[unified neutral theory of biodiversity]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Hubbell, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8871">'''Asteya'''  is the [[Sanskrit]] term for "non-stealing". It is a [[virtue]] in [[Jainism]] . The practice of ''asteya'' demands that one must not steal, nor have the intent to steal another's property through action, speech and thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Corner (2009), Workplace spirituality and business ethics: Insights from an Eastern spiritual tradition, Journal of business ethics, 85(3), 377–389&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kntiwari87&gt;KN Tiwari (1998), Classical Indian Ethical Thought, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120816077}}, page 87&lt;/ref&gt;

Asteya is considered as one of five [[Ethics in Jainism|major vows]] of Jainism.&lt;ref name=jw/&gt; It is also considered one of ten forms of [[Temperance (virtue)|temperance]] (virtuous self-restraint) in [[Indian philosophy]].&lt;ref name=knaiyar&gt;KN Aiyar (1914), Thirty Minor Upanishads, Kessinger Publishing, {{ISBN|978-1164026419}}, Chapter 22, pages 173–176&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word "'''''asteya'''''" is a compound derived from Sanskrit language, where "'''''a'''''" refers to "non-" and "'''''steya'''''" refers to "practice of stealing" or "something that can be stolen". Thus, ''asteya'' means "non-stealing".

==Jainism==
In [[Jainism]], it is one of the five vows that all [[Śrāvaka (Jainism)|Śrāvakas and Śrāvikā]]s (householders) as well as [[Jain monasticism|monastics]] must observe.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Glasenapp|first=Helmuth Von|title=Jainism: An Indian Religion of Salvation|year=1999|location = Delhi|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Jainism.html?id=WzEzXDk0v6sC|isbn=81-208-1376-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The five transgressions of this vow as mentioned in the [[Jain text]], ''Tattvārthsūtra'' are: "Prompting another to steal, receiving stolen goods, underbuying in a disordered state, using false weights and measures, and deceiving others with artificial or imitation goods".{{sfn|S.A. Jain|1992|p=208}}
This is explained in the Jain text, [[Sarvārthasiddhi]] as (translated by S.A. Jain): {{quote|Prompting a person to steal, or prompting him through another or approving of the theft, is the first transgression. The second is receiving stolen goods from a person, whose action has neither been prompted nor approved by the recipient. Receiving or buying goods otherwise than by lawful and just means is an irregularity or a transgression. An attempt to buy precious things very cheaply in a disordered state is the third transgression. Cheating others by the use of false weights and measures in order to obtain more from others and give less to others, is the fourth transgression. Deceiving others with artificial gold, synthetic diamonds and so on, is the fifth transgression. These five are the transgressions of the vow of non-stealing.| ''Sarvārthasiddhi'' (7–27){{sfn|S.A. Jain|1992|p=208}}}}

==Hinduism==
Asteya is defined in Hindu scripts as "the abstinence, in one's deeds or words or thoughts, from unauthorized appropriation of things of value from another human being".&lt;ref name=jw/&gt; It is a widely discussed virtue in ethical theories of Hinduism.&lt;ref name=kntiwari87/&gt; For example, in the [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali|Yoga Sūtras]] (II.30), ''Asteya'' (non-stealing) is listed as the third [[Yamas]] or virtue of self-restraint, along with [[Ahimsa]] (nonviolence), [[Satya]] (non-falsehoods, truthfulness), [[Brahmacharya]] (sexual chastity in one's feelings and actions) and [[Aparigraha]] (non-possessiveness, non-craving).&lt;ref name=jw&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/yogasystemofpata00wooduoft#page/178/mode/2up The yoga system of Patanjali] James Wood (Translator), Harvard University Press, pages 178–182&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Georg Feuerstein and Jeanine Miller (1997), The Essence of Yoga, {{ISBN|978-0892817382}}, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
{{lang|sa|अहिंसासत्यास्तेय ब्रह्मचर्यापरिग्रहाः यमाः ॥३०॥}}

Non-violence, Non-falsehood, Non-stealing, Non-cheating (celibacy, chastity), and Non-possessiveness are the five Yamas. (30)
&lt;/poem&gt;
|[[Patanjali|Patañjali]]|Yoga Sutra 2.30&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashtangayoga.info/source-texts/yoga-sutra-patanjali/chapter-2/ Yoga Sutra], Sadhana Pada, Verse 30&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Asteya is thus one of the five essential restraints (''yamas'', "the don'ts") in Hinduism, that with five essential practices (''niyamas'', "the dos") are suggested for right, virtuous, enlightened living.&lt;ref&gt;Mathew Clarke (2014), Handbook of Research on Development and Religion, Elgar Reference, {{ISBN|978-0857933577}}, page 83&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discussion===
Asteya in practice, states Patricia Corner, implies to "not steal", "not cheat" nor unethically manipulate other's property or others for one's own gain.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Corner (2008, August), EXTENDING THEORY THROUGH EXPERIENCE: A FRAMEWORK FOR BUSINESS ETHICS FROM YOGA, In Academy of Management Proceedings (Vol. 2008, No. 1, pp. 1–6), Academy of Management&lt;/ref&gt; Asteya as virtue demands that not only one "not steal" through one's action, one shouldn't want to encourage cheating through speech or writing, or want to cheat even in one's thinking. Smith states&lt;ref&gt;D'Arcy Smith (2007), The Issue of Vocal Practice: Finding a Vocabulary for Our Blocks and Resistances, Voice and Speech Review, 5(1), 128–131&lt;/ref&gt; that the virtue of ''asteya'' arises out of the understanding that all misappropriation is an expression of craving and a feeling of lack of [[Compassion#Hinduism|compassion]] for other beings. To steal or want to steal expresses lack of faith in oneself, one's ability to learn and create property. To steal another's property is also stealing from one's own potential ability to develop.&lt;ref&gt;JP Falk (2005), Yoga and Ethics in High School, Journal of Dance Education, 5(4), pages 132–134&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sutra]]s reason that misappropriation, conspiring to misappropriate or wanting to misappropriate, at its root reflects the sin of ''lobha'' (bad greed), ''moha'' (material delusion) or ''krodha'' (bad anger).&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Klostermair (2007), A Survey of Hinduism, 3rd Edition, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791470824}}, page 347&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]] held ''[[ahimsa]]'' as essential to the human right to life and liberty without fear, ''asteya'' as human right to property without fear.&lt;ref name=nikam&gt;Nikam, N. A. (1954), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20123409 Gandhi's Philosophy], The Review of Metaphysics, Vol. 7, No. 4, pages 668–678&lt;/ref&gt; Asteya follows from Ahimsa, in Gandhi's views, because stealing is a form of violence and injury to another person.&lt;ref name=nikam/&gt; Asteya is not merely "theft by action", but it includes "theft by intent" and "theft by manipulation". Persistent exploitation of the weak or poor is a form of "asteya in one's thought".&lt;ref name=nikam/&gt;

===Related concepts===
[[Dāna]], that is charity to a deserving person without any expectation in return, is a recommended ''[[niyama]]'' in Hinduism. The motive behind Dāna is reverse to that of "stealing from others". Dāna is a complementary practice to the [[yamas]] (restraint) of ''asteya''.&lt;ref&gt;Patañjali (Translator: SV Bharti), Yoga Sutras of Patanjali: With the Exposition of Vyasa, Vol. 2, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120818255}}, pages 684–686&lt;/ref&gt;

==Difference from Aparigraha==
Asteya and [[Aparigraha]] are two of several important virtues in Hinduism and Jainism. They both involve interaction between a person and material world, either as property, fame or ideas; yet Asteya and Aparigraha are different concepts. Asteya is the virtue of non-stealing and not wanting to appropriate, or take by force or deceit or exploitation, by deeds or words or thoughts, what is owned by and belongs to someone else.&lt;ref name=nikam/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donna Farhi (2011), Yoga Mind, Body &amp; Spirit: A Return to Wholeness, MacMillan, {{ISBN|978-0805059700}}, pages 10–11&lt;/ref&gt; Aparigraha, in contrast, is the virtue of non-possessiveness and non-clinging to one's own property, non-accepting any gifts or particularly improper gifts offered by others, and of non-avarice, non-craving in the motivation of one's deeds, words and thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;David Frawley, Yoga and the Sacred Fire: Self-Realization and Planetary Transformation, Motilal Banarsidas, {{ISBN|978-8120827462}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C Bell (2011), Mindful Yoga, Mindful Life: A Guide for Everyday Practice, Rodmell Press, {{ISBN|978-1930485204}}, page 74-89&lt;/ref&gt;

''Attraction'' may also refer to the object of the attraction itself, as in ''[[tourist attraction]]''.

==Visual attractiveness==
Visual attractiveness or visual appeal is attraction produced primarily by [[visual perception|visual stimuli]].

==Physical attractiveness==
{{Main|Physical attractiveness}}

[[Physical attractiveness]] is the perception of the physical traits of an individual [[human]] [[person]] as pleasing or [[beauty|beautiful]]. It can include various implications, such as [[sexual attractiveness]], [[cuteness]], [[Interpersonal attraction#Similarity (like-attracts-like)|similarity]] and [[physical attractiveness|physique]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Physical attractiveness can also include the attraction of smell. Pheromones secreted by animals and humans alike can attract others, and this is viewed as being attracted to smell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/14/science-of-attraction-_n_6661522.html|title=The Strange Science Of Sexual Attraction|last=Gregoire|first=Carolyn|date=2015-02-14|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=HuffPo isn't the best possible source for medicine related topics|date=June 2018}} [[Human sex pheromones]] may play a role in human attraction, although it is unclear how well humans can actually pick up on the pheromones of another. 

Judgment of attractiveness of physical traits is partly universal to all human cultures, partly dependent on culture or [[society]] or time period, partly biological, and partly subjective and individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Hönekopp | first = Johannes | authorlink = | title = Once more: Is beauty in the eye of the beholder? Relative contributions of private and shared taste to judgments of facial attractiveness | publisher = APA| year = 2006 | url = http://www.tu-chemnitz.de/hsw/psychologie/professuren/allpsy2/Artikel/JEPHPP_2006.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cognitive_emotions_1989"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Review_Ortony_1989"/&gt;

==The Science Behind Attraction==
According to a study determining the golden ratio for facial beauty, the most attractive face is one with average distances between facial features, and an average length and width of the face itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pallett|first=Pamela|last2=Link|first2=Stephen|last3=Lee|first3=Kang|date=November 6, 2009|title=New "Golden" Ratios for Facial Beauty|pmc=2814183|journal=Vision Research|volume=50|pages=149–154|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Facial attractiveness, or [[beauty]], can also be determined by symmetry. If a face is asymmetrical, this can indicate unhealthy genetic information. Therefore, if a face is symmetrical (see [[Facial symmetry]]), healthy genetic information is implied. People will judge potential mates based off the physical expression of the genetic health, which is their apparent attractiveness&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=B.C.|last2=Little|first2=A.C.|last3=Penton-Voak|first3=I.S.|last4=Tiddeman|first4=B.P.|last5=Burt|first5=D.M.|last6=Perrett|first6=D.I.|date=November 2001|title=Facial symmetry and judgements of apparent health: Support for a “good genes” explanation of the attractiveness–symmetry relationship|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090513801000836|journal=Evolution and Human Behavior|volume=22|pages=417-420|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This supports the good genes theory, which indicates that attractiveness is seen as a way to ensure that offspring will have the healthiest genes and therefore the best chance of survival. Certain trains that indicate good genes (such as clear skin or facial symmetry) are seen as desirable when choosing a partner&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/good-genes-hypothesis|title=Good genes hypothesis|last=The Editors of Encyclopedia Britannica|first=|date=|website=Encyclopedia Brittanica|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Sexual Selection and Attraction in Non-human Animals==

Among animals, females often are "choosy" about who they pick for a mate. They will look for characteristics in their potential mates that ensure their offspring will have healthy genetic material. Therefore, they will be attracted to certain traits or behaviors of their potential mates. Attraction among animals is based mostly on what will give the females the best chance of having the most and healthiest offspring that will likely survive to adulthood because of the traits they will inherit from the male&lt;ref&gt; Alcock, J. (2001). The Evolution of Reproductive Behavior. In Animal Behavior. (7 ed. pp. 341) Sunderland, Massachusetts: Arizona State University. &lt;/ref&gt;. Females will look for signs of health in the males, such as large and fancy adornments, bright colors, or other features that the male will only have if he is in good health. &lt;ref&gt;Bateson, P. Editor. (1983). Sexual Selection by Female Choice by Peter O'Donald. in Mate Choice. (pp.&amp;nbsp;53). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:Circus-Parade white-bandwagon Jul09.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A literal "bandwagon", from which the metaphor is derived.]]
The '''bandwagon effect''' is a phenomenon whereby the rate of uptake of beliefs, ideas, [[fads and trends]] increases the more that they have already been adopted by others. In other words, the bandwagon effect is characterized by the probability of individual adoption increasing with respect to the proportion who have already done so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Andrew |last=Colman |title=Oxford Dictionary of Psychology |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2003 |page=77 |isbn=0-19-280632-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As more people come to believe in something, others also "hop on the bandwagon" regardless of the underlying evidence.

The tendency to follow the actions or beliefs of others can occur because individuals directly prefer to conform, or because individuals derive information from others. Both explanations have been used for evidence of [[conformity]] in psychological experiments. For example, social pressure has been used to explain [[Asch conformity experiments|Asch's conformity experiments]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Asch |first=S. E. |year=1955 |title=Opinions and social pressure |journal=Scientific American |volume=193 |pages=31–35 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1155-31 |issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and information has been used to explain [[Muzafer Sherif#Autokinetic effect experiments|Sherif's autokinetic experiment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sherif |first=M. |year=1936 |title=The psychology of social norms |location=New York |publisher=Harper Collins }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to this concept, the increasing popularity of a product or phenomenon encourages more people to "get on the bandwagon", too. The bandwagon effect explains why there are fashion trends.&lt;ref name="LongFox2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=D. Stephen Long|author2=Nancy Ruth Fox|title=Calculated Futures: Theology, Ethics, and Economics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=82SruCvd69UC&amp;pg=PT62|accessdate=30 August 2013|year=2007|publisher=Baylor University Press|isbn=978-1-60258-014-5|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When individuals make [[rationality|rational]] choices based on the information they receive from others, economists have proposed that [[information cascades]] can quickly form in which people decide to ignore their personal information signals and follow the behavior of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bikhchandani |first=Sushil |last2=Hirshleifer |first2=David |last3=Welch |first3=Ivo |year=1992 |title=A Theory of Fads, Fashion, Custom, and Cultural Change as Informational Cascades |journal=[[Journal of Political Economy]] |volume=100 |issue=5 |pages=992–1026 |doi= 10.1086/261849|jstor=2138632 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cascades explain why behavior is fragile—people understand that they are based on very limited information. As a result, fads form easily but are also easily dislodged. Such informational effects have been used to explain political bandwagons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lohmann |first=S. |year=1994 |title=The Dynamics of Informational Cascades: The Monday Demonstrations in Leipzig, East Germany, 1989-91 |journal=World Politics |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=42–101 |jstor=2950679 |doi=10.2307/2950679 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The definition of a bandwagon is a wagon which carries a band during the course of a parade, circus or other entertainment event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/bandwagon |publisher=Dictionary.com |title= Bandwagon |accessdate=2007-03-09| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070312031504/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/bandwagon| archivedate= 12 March 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase "jump on the bandwagon" first appeared in American politics in 1848 when [[Dan Rice]], a famous and popular circus clown of the time, used his bandwagon and its music to gain attention for his political campaign appearances. As his campaign became more successful, other politicians strove for a seat on the bandwagon, hoping to be associated with his success. Later, during the time of [[William Jennings Bryan]]'s 1900 presidential campaign, bandwagons had become standard in campaigns,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wordwizard.com/phpbb3/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=6642 |title=Bandwagon Effect |accessdate=2007-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the phrase "jump on the bandwagon" was used as a derogatory term, implying that people were associating themselves with success without considering that with which they associated themselves.

The bandwagon effect occurs in voting:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nadeau |first=Richard |first2=Edouard |last2=Cloutier |first3=J.-H. |last3=Guay |title=New Evidence About the Existence of a Bandwagon Effect in the Opinion Formation Process |journal=International Political Science Review |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=203–213 |year=1993 |doi=10.1177/019251219301400204 }}&lt;/ref&gt; some people vote for those candidates or parties who are likely to succeed (or are proclaimed as such by the media), hoping to be on the "winner's side" in the end.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} The bandwagon effect has been applied to situations involving majority opinion, such as political outcomes, where people alter their opinions to the majority view.{{sfn|McAllister| Studlar|1991}} Such a shift in opinion can occur because individuals draw inferences from the decisions of others, as in an [[informational cascade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dumaguetemetropost.com/beware-of-the-bandwagon-effect-other-cognitive-biases-p7272-99.htm|title=Beware of the bandwagon effect, other cognitive biases|website=dumaguetemetropost.com|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Because of time zones, election results are broadcast in the eastern parts of the United States while polls are still open in the west. This difference has led to research on how the behavior of voters in western United States is influenced by news about the decisions of voters in other time zones. In 1980, [[NBC News]] declared [[Ronald Reagan]] to be the winner of the presidential race on the basis of the exit polls several hours before the voting booths closed in the west.

It is also said to be important in the American presidential primary elections. States all vote at different times, spread over some months, rather than all on one day. Some states (Iowa, New Hampshire) have special precedence to go early while others choose to wait until a certain date. This is often said to give undue influence to these states, a win in these early states is said to give a candidate the "[[The Big Mo|Big Mo]]" (momentum) and has propelled many candidates to win the nomination. Because of this, other states often try front loading (going as early as possible) to make their say as influential as they can. In the 2008 presidential primaries two states had all or some of their delegates banned from the convention by the central party organizations for voting too early.&lt;ref&gt;(2007, October 22). 5 States May Use Half Of GOP [Supplemental Material]. ''USA Today''. Retrieved from https://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/election2008/2007-10-22-gop-delegates_N.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,294601,00.html |title=Florida Democrats Stripped of Convention Delegates Due to Early Primary |work=FOX News |date=2007-08-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several studies have tested this theory of the bandwagon effect in political decision making. In the [[#CITEREFGoidelShields1994|1994 study]] of Robert K. Goidel and Todd G. Shields in ''[[The Journal of Politics]]'', 180 students at the University of Kentucky were randomly assigned to nine groups and were asked questions about the same set of election scenarios. About 70% of subjects received information about the expected winner.{{sfn|Goidel|Shields|1994|p=807}} Independents, which are those who do not vote based on the endorsement of any party and are ultimately neutral, were influenced strongly in favor of the person expected to win.{{sfn|Goidel|Shields|1994|pp=807-808}} Expectations played a significant role throughout the study. It was found that independents are twice as likely to vote for the Republican candidate when the Republican is expected to win. From the results, it was also found that when the Democrat was expected to win, independent Republicans and weak Republicans were more likely to vote for the Democratic candidate.{{sfn|Goidel|Shields|1994|p=808}}

A study by Albert Mehrabian, reported in the ''[[Journal of Applied Social Psychology]]'' ([[#CITEREFMehrabian1998|1998]]), tested the relative importance of the bandwagon (rally around the winner) effect versus the [[underdog (competition)|underdog]] (empathic support for those trailing) effect. Bogus poll results presented to voters prior to the 1996 Republican primary clearly showed the bandwagon effect to predominate on balance. Indeed, approximately 6% of the variance in the vote was explained in terms of the bogus polls, showing that poll results (whether accurate or inaccurate) can significantly influence election results in closely contested elections. In particular, assuming that one candidate "is an initial favorite by a slim margin, reports of polls showing that candidate as the leader in the race will increase his or her favorable margin".{{sfn|Mehrabian|1998|p=2128}} Thus, as poll results are repeatedly reported, the bandwagon effect will tend to snowball and become a powerful aid to leading candidates.

During the 1992 U.S. presidential election, Vicki G. Morwitz and Carol Pluzinski conducted a study, which was published in ''The Journal of Consumer Research'' ([[#CITEREFMorwitzPluzinski1996|1996]]). At a large northeastern university, some of 214 volunteer business students were given the results of student and national polls indicating that [[Bill Clinton]] was in the lead. Others were not exposed to the results of the polls. Several students who had intended to vote for Bush changed their minds after seeing the poll results.{{sfn|Morwitz|Pluzinski|1996|pp=58-64}}

Additionally, British polls have shown an increase to public exposure. Sixty-eight percent of voters had heard of the general election campaign results of the opinion poll in 1979. In 1987, this number of voters aware of the results increased to 74%.{{sfn|McAllister| Studlar|1991| p=725}} According to British studies, there is a consistent pattern of apparent bandwagon effects for the leading party.

In a study published in the ''[[European Economic Review]]'' (2015),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Morton|first=Rebecca|first2=Mueller|last2=Daniel|first3=Page |last3=Lionel|first4=Torgler|last4=Benno|title=Exit polls, turnout, and bandwagon voting: Evidence from a natural experiment |journal=European Economic Review |volume=77 |pages=65–81 |year=2015 |doi=10.1016/j.euroecorev.2015.03.012|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014292115000483}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morton and co-authors, used the large number of time zones across French overseas territories, to study the bandwagon effect. Before 2002, all territories were voting on Sunday in the presidential elections. For that reason, voters in territories located to the West of mainland France (e.g. French Guyana) could observe the exit polls from mainland France before the close of their local polling booths. After 2002, a law was passed for these territories to vote on Saturday, in order to avoid this situation. The authors observed a bandwagon effect: when voters from Western territories could observe the winner in mainland France, this candidate was doing much better locally. After 2002, when voting in these territories took place before mainland France, this bandwagon voting disappeared.

==In microeconomics==
{{See also|Network effect|Veblen good}}
In [[microeconomics]], bandwagon effects may play out in interactions of demand and preference.&lt;ref name="harvey"&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink= Harvey Leibenstein |first= Harvey |last= Leibenstein |title= Bandwagon, Snob, and Veblen Effects in the Theory of Consumers' Demand |journal= [[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] |year= 1950 |volume= 64 |issue= 2 |pages= 183–207 |doi= 10.2307/1882692 |jstor= 1882692 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=June 2018}} The bandwagon effect arises when people's preference for a commodity increases as the number of people buying it increases. This interaction potentially disturbs the normal results of the theory of [[supply and demand]], which assumes that consumers make buying decisions solely based on price and their own personal preference.

Gary Becker has argued that bandwagon effects could be so strong as to make the [[demand curve]] slope upward.&lt;ref&gt;

A substantial literature now invokes Becker's bandwagon, also ignoring Leibenstein.

== In medicine ==
Medical bandwagons have been identified as “the overwhelming acceptance of unproved but popular ideas”. They have led to inappropriate therapies for numerous numbers of patients, and have impeded the development of more appropriate treatment.

In Lawrence Cohen and Henry Rothschild's exposition ''The Bandwagons of Medicine'' (1979) several of these therapeutic misadventures, some of which persisted for centuries before they were abandoned, substituted by another bandwagon, or replaced by a scientifically valid alternative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cohen|first1=L|last2=Rothschild|first2=H|title=The bandwagons of medicine|journal=Perspectives in Biology and Medicine|date=1979|volume=22|issue=4|pages=531–8|pmid=226929|doi=10.1353/pbm.1979.0037}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient serpent cult of Aesculapius, in which sacred snakes licked the afflicted as treatment of their diseases, is an example of a bandwagon gathering momentum based on a strong personality, in this case a Roman god.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S1091-255X(02)00054-9|pmid=12504215|title=The Bandwagon Effect|journal=Journal of Gastrointestinal Surgery|volume=6|issue=6|pages=787–794|year=2002|last1=Rikkers|first1=L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One who supports a particular sports team, despite having shown no interest in that team until it started gaining success, can be considered a "bandwagon fan".

'''Brainwashing''' (also known as '''mind control''', '''menticide''', '''coercive persuasion''',  '''thought control''', '''thought reform''', and '''re-education''') is the concept that the [[human mind]] can be altered or controlled by certain [[psychological]] techniques. Brainwashing is said to reduce its subject’s ability to [[think]] critically or independently,&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Religion, Volume 2, Gyan Publishing House, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; to allow the introduction of new, unwanted thoughts and ideas into the subject’s mind,&lt;ref&gt;Campbell's Psychiatric Dictionary, Robert Jean Campbell, Oxford University Press, USA, 2004, page 403&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to change his or her attitudes, values, and beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;The Dictionary of Psychology, Raymond J. Corsini, Psychology Press, 2002, page 127&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kowal, D. M. (2000). Brainwashing. In A. E. LOVE (Ed.), Encyclopedia of psychology, vol. 1 (pp. 463-464). American Psychological Association. {{DOI|10.1037/10516-173}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The concept of brainwashing was originally developed in the 1950s to explain how the [[Chinese government]] appeared to make people cooperate with them. Advocates of the concept also looked at [[Nazi Germany]], at some criminal cases in the United States, and at the actions of [[Human trafficking|human traffickers]]. It was later applied by [[Margaret Singer]], [[Philip Zimbardo]] and some others in the [[anti-cult movement]] to explain conversions to some [[new religious movement]]s and other groups. This resulted in [[scientific]] and [[legal]] debate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wright|first=Stuart|title=Media Coverage of Unconventional Religion: Any "Good News" for Minority Faiths?|journal=Review of Religious Research|date=December 1997|volume=39|issue=2|pages=101–115|doi=10.2307/3512176|jstor=3512176}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Eileen Barker]], [[James Richardson (sociologist)|James Richardson]], and other scholars, as well as legal experts, rejecting at least the popular understanding of brainwashing.&lt;ref name="Melton"&gt;{{cite web |first=J.

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' records the earliest known English-language usage of the word "brainwashing" in an article by newspaperman [[Edward Hunter (U.S. journalist)|Edward Hunter]], in ''Miami News'', published on 24 September 1950.

The U.S. military and government laid charges of brainwashing in an effort to undermine  confessions made by POWs to war crimes, including [[Allegations of biological warfare in the Korean War|biological warfare]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Endicott and Edward Hagerman, ''The United States and Biological Warfare: Secrets From the Early Cold War'' (Indiana University Press, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; After Chinese radio broadcasts claimed to quote [[Frank Schwable]], Chief of Staff of the [[1st Marine Aircraft Wing|First Marine Air Wing]] admitting to participating in germ warfare, United Nations commander Gen.

Beginning in 1953, [[Robert Jay Lifton]] interviewed American servicemen who had been POWs during the [[Korean War]] as well as priests, students, and teachers who had been held in prison in China after 1951. In addition to interviews with 25 Americans and Europeans, Lifton interviewed 15 Chinese citizens who had fled after having been subjected to indoctrination in Chinese universities. (Lifton's 1961 book ''[[Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism: A Study of "Brainwashing" in China]]'', was based on this research.)&lt;ref&gt;A. L. Wilkes ''Knowledge in Minds'', p. 323, Psychology Press, 1998 {{ISBN|978-0-86377-439-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Lifton found that when the  POWs returned to the United States their thinking soon returned to normal, contrary to the popular image of "brainwashing."&lt;ref name="Home_by_Ship"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Home by Ship: Reaction Patterns of American Prisoners of War Repatriated from North Korea |journal=American Journal of Psychiatry |date=April 1954 |first=Robert J. |last=Lifton |volume=110 |issue=10 |pages=732–739 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/abstract/110/10/732 |accessdate=2008-03-30 |pmid=13138750 |doi=10.1176/ajp.110.10.732}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[George Orwell]]'s 1949 [[dystopian]] novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' the main character is subjected to imprisonment, isolation, and torture in order to conform his thoughts and emotions to the wishes of the rulers of Orwell's fictional future [[totalitarian]] society. Orwell's vision influenced Hunter and is still reflected in the popular understanding of the concept of brainwashing.&lt;ref&gt;Psychiatry and Public Affairs, Leo H.

In the 1950s many American films were filmed that featured brainwashing of POWs, including ''[[The Rack (film)|The Rack]]'', ''[[The Bamboo Prison]]'', ''[[Toward the Unknown]]'', and ''[[The Fearmakers]]''. ''[[Forbidden Area]]'' told the story of Soviet secret agents who had been brainwashed through [[classical conditioning]] by their own government so they wouldn't reveal their identities. In 1962 ''[[The Manchurian Candidate (1962 film)|The Manchurian Candidate]]'' (based on the 1959 novel by [[Richard Condon]]) "put brainwashing front and center" by featuring a plot by the Soviet government to take over the United States by use of a brainwashed presidential candidate.&lt;ref&gt;''Screen Enemies of the American Way: Political Paranoia About Nazis, Communists, Saboteurs, Terrorists and Body Snatching Aliens in Film and Television'', Fraser A.

Mind control remains an important theme in [[science fiction]]. Terry O'Brien comments: "Mind control is such a powerful image that if [[hypnotism]] did not exist, then something similar would have to have been invented: the plot device is too useful for any writer to ignore. The fear of mind control is equally as powerful an image."&lt;ref&gt;Terry O'Brien in ''The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Themes, Works, and Wonders, Volume 1'', Gary Westfahl editor, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; A subgenre is ''corporate mind control'', in which a future society is run by one or more business [[corporations]] that dominate society using [[advertising]] and [[mass media]] to control the population's thoughts and feelings.&lt;ref&gt;Per Schelde, ''Androids, Humanoids, and Other Science Fiction Monsters: Science and Soul in Science Fiction Films'', NYU Press, 1 July 1994, pages 169-175&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal and civil cases==
In 1974, [[Patty Hearst]], a member of the wealthy [[William Randolph Hearst|Hearst family]], was [[Kidnapping|kidnapped]] by a left-wing group calling itself the [[Symbionese Liberation Army]]. After several weeks of captivity she agreed to join the group and took part in their activities.  In 1975, she was arrested and charged with bank robbery and use of a gun in committing a felony.  Her attorney, [[F. Lee Bailey]] argued in her trial  that she should not be held responsible for her actions since her treatment by her captors was the equivalent of the brainwashing of Korean War POWs. (See: [[diminished responsibility]].)  Hearst was found guilty, but her “brainwashing defense” brought the topic to renewed public attention in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;Regulating Religion: Case Studies from Around the Globe, James T. Richardson, Springer Science &amp; Business Media, Dec 6, 2012, page 518&lt;/ref&gt; as did the 1969 to 1971 case of [[Charles Manson]], who was said to have brainwashed his followers to commit murder and other crimes.&lt;ref&gt;''Minds on Trial: Great Cases in Law and Psychology'', by Charles Patrick Ewing, Joseph T.

Bailey developed his case in conjunction with psychiatrist [[Louis Jolyon West]] and psychologist [[Margaret Singer]].  They had both studied the experiences of  Korean War POWs. In 1996 Singer published her theories in her best-selling book ''[[Cults in Our Midst]]''.&lt;ref name="refocus.org"&gt;[http://www.refocus.org/singerne.html ''Cults in Our Midst: The Continuing Fight Against Their Hidden Menace''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202034934/http://www.refocus.org/singerne.html |date=2 February 2015 }}, Margaret Thaler Singer, Jossey-Bass, publisher, April 2003, {{ISBN|0-7879-6741-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "clarke"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DouBAgAAQBAJ|title=Encyclopedia of New Religious Movements|isbn=9781134499700|last1=Clarke|first1=Peter|last2=Clarke|first2=Reader in Modern History Fellow Peter|date=March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/09/us/louis-j-west-74-psychiatrist-who-studied-extremes-dies.html|title=Louis J.

[[Italy]] has had controversy over the concept of ''[[plagio]]'', a crime consisting in an absolute psychological—and eventually physical—domination of a person. The effect is said to be the annihilation of the subject's [[freedom]] and [[self-determination]] and the consequent negation of his or her [[personality]]. The crime of plagio has rarely been prosecuted in Italy, and only one person was ever convicted. In 1981, an Italian court found that the concept is imprecise, lacks coherence, and is liable to arbitrary application.&lt;ref&gt;Alessandro Usai “Profili penali dei condizionamenti mentali, Milano, 1996 {{ISBN|88-14-06071-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  By the twenty-first century, the concept of brainwashing was being applied "with some success" in  [[child custody]] and [[child sexual abuse]] cases. In some cases "one parent is accused of brainwashing the child to reject the other parent, and in child sex abuse cases where one parent is accused of brainwashing the child to make sex abuse accusations against the other parent" (possibly resulting in or causing [[parental alienation]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Warshak|Warshak, R.

In 2003, forensic psychologist [[Dick Anthony]] said that "no reasonable person would question that there are situations where people can be influenced against their best interests, but those arguments are evaluated on the basis of fact, not bogus expert testimony."&lt;ref name="Oldenburg"/&gt;  In 2016, Israeli anthropologist of religion and fellow at the [[Van Leer Jerusalem Institute]] Adam Klin-Oron said about then-proposed "anti-cult" legislation: 
:''In the 1980s there was a wave of ‘brainwashing’ claims, and then parliaments around the world examined the issue, courts around the world examined the issue, and reached a clear ruling: That there is no such thing as cults…that the people making these claims are often not experts on the issue. And in the end courts, including in Israel, rejected expert witnesses who claimed there is "brainwashing."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/will-israels-first-anti-cult-legislation-harm-religious-freedom], ''[[Times of Israel]]&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;''&lt;/ref&gt;''

It is neither magical nor mystical, but a process that involves a set of basic social psychological principles. Conformity, compliance, persuasion, dissonance, reactance, guilt and fear arousal, modeling and identification are some of the staple social influence ingredients well studied in psychological experiments and field studies. In some combinations, they create a powerful crucible of extreme mental and behavioral [[Psychological manipulation|manipulation]] when synthesized with several other real-world factors, such as charismatic, authoritarian leaders, dominant ideologies, social isolation, physical debilitation, induced phobias, and extreme threats or promised rewards that are typically deceptively orchestrated, over an extended time period in settings where they are applied intensively. A body of social science evidence shows that when systematically practiced by state-sanctioned police, military or destructive cults, mind control can induce false confessions, create converts who willingly torture or kill 'invented enemies,' and engage indoctrinated members to work tirelessly, give up their money—and even their lives—for 'the cause.'}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he suggested that any human being is susceptible to such manipulation.&lt;ref name="Zimbardo 1997 14"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zimbardo |first=P |authorlink=Philip Zimbardo |url= http://www.csj.org/studyindex/studycult/study_zimbar.htm |page=14 |title=What messages are behind today's cults? |journal=Monitor on Psychology |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another adherent to this view, Jean-Marie Abgrall was heavily criticized by forensic psychologist Dick Anthony for employing a [[pseudo-scientific]] approach and lacking any evidence that anyone's [[worldview]] was substantially changed by these coercive methods.

And, of course, most contacts dropped out before attending a retreat. Of all those who visited a Moonie centre at least once, not one in two-hundred remained in the movement two years later.

===American Psychological Association on brainwashing===
{{Main article|APA Task Force on Deceptive and Indirect Techniques of Persuasion and Control}}
In 1983, the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) asked Singer to chair a [[taskforce]] called the APA Task Force on Deceptive and Indirect Techniques of Persuasion and Control (DIMPAC) to investigate whether brainwashing or coercive persuasion did indeed play a role in recruitment by NRMs.
&lt;ref&gt;
As archived at http://www.cesnur.org/testi/DIMPAC.htm, retrieved 2008-06-23
&lt;/ref&gt; It came to the following conclusion:&lt;ref&gt;

''Cults and [[large group awareness training]]s have generated considerable controversy because of their widespread use of deceptive and indirect techniques of persuasion and control. These techniques can compromise individual freedom, and their use has resulted in serious harm to thousands of individuals and families. This report reviews the literature on this subject, proposes a new way of conceptualizing influence techniques, explores the ethical ramifications of deceptive and indirect techniques of persuasion and control, and makes recommendations addressing the problems described in the report.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 11 May 1987, the APA's Board of Social and Ethical Responsibility for Psychology (BSERP) rejected the DIMPAC report because the report "lacks the scientific rigor and evenhanded critical approach necessary for APA imprimatur", and concluded that "after much consideration, BSERP does not believe that we have sufficient information available to guide us in taking a position on this issue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cesnur.org/testi/APA.htm |title=Memorandum |accessdate=2008-11-18 |author=American Psychological Association Board of Social and Ethical Responsibility for Psychology (BSERP) |date=1987-05-11 |work=CESNUR: APA Memo of 1987 with Enclosures |publisher=CESNUR Center for Studies on New Religion |quote=BSERP thanks the Task Force on Deceptive and Indirect Methods of Persuasion and Control for its service but is unable to accept the report of the Task Force.

Russian historian [[Daniel Romanovsky]], who interviewed survivors and eyewitnesses in the 1970s, reported on what he called "[[Nazi]] brainwashing" of the people of [[Belarus]] by the occupying Germans during the [[Second World War]], which took place through both mass [[propaganda]] and intense re-education, especially in schools. Romanovsky noted that very soon most people had adopted the Nazi view that the Jews were an inferior race and were closely tied to the [[Soviet]] government, views that had not been at all common before the German occupation.&lt;ref&gt;''Nazi Europe and the Final Solution'', David Bankier, Israel Gutman, Berghahn Books, 2009, page 282-285.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gray Zones: Ambiguity and Compromise in the Holocaust and its Aftermath, Jonathan Petropoulos, John Roth, Berghahn Books, Jul 15, 2005, page 209&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Minsk Ghetto 1941-1943: Jewish Resistance and Soviet Internationalism, Barbara Epstein, University of California Press, 2008, page 295&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bringing the Dark Past to Light: The Reception of the Holocaust in Postcommunist Europe, John-Paul Himka, Joanna Beata Michlic, University of Nebraska Press, Jul 1, 2013, pages 74, 78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/sc3/soviet_jews_exodus/English/Interview_s/InterviewRomanovsky.shtml Interview]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;*{{citation|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oU6WielZ_VoC&amp;pg=PA276#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|chapter=The Soviet Person as a Bystander of the Holocaust: The case of eastern Belorussia|first=Daniel|last=Romanovsky|page=276|title=Nazi Europe and the Final Solution|editor-first=David|editor-last=Bankier|editor2-first=Israel|editor2-last=Gutman|year=2009|publisher=Berghahn Books}}

[[Joost Meerloo]], a Dutch psychiatrist, was an early proponent of the concept of brainwashing. ("Menticide" is a [[neologism]] coined by him meaning: "killing of the mind.") Meerloo's view was influenced by his experiences during the German occupation of his country and his work with the Dutch government and the American military in the [[interrogation]] of accused [[Nazi war criminals]]. He later emigrated to the United States and taught at [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Handbook of Propaganda Studies, Jonathan Auerbach, Russ Castronovo, Oxford University Press, 2014, page 114&lt;/ref&gt; His best-selling 1956 book, ''The Rape of the Mind'', concludes by saying: 
:''The modern techniques of brainwashing and menticide—those perversions of psychology—can bring almost any man into submission and surrender. Many of the victims of thought control, brainwashing, and menticide that we have talked about were strong men whose minds and wills were broken and degraded. But although the totalitarians use their knowledge of the mind for vicious and unscrupulous purposes, our democratic society can and must use its knowledge to help man to grow, to guard his freedom, and to understand himself.'' &lt;ref&gt;*{{Cite web |author= [[Joost Meerloo|Meerloo, Joost]] |url=http://www.lermanet.com/scientology/mc-ch1.html |title=''The Rape of the Mind: The Psychology of Thought Control, Menticide, and Brainwashing'' |year=1956 |publisher=World Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have said that modern [[business corporation]]s practice mind control to create a work force that shares common values and culture.&lt;ref&gt;''Exploring Leadership: Individual, Organizational, and Societal Perspectives'', Richard Bolden, Beverley Hawkins, Jonathan Gosling, Scott Taylor, Oxford University Press, 30 June 2011, page 95.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have linked "corporate brainwashing" with [[globalization]], saying that corporations are attempting to create a worldwide [[Cultural homogenization|monocultural]] network of producers, consumers, and managers.&lt;ref&gt;''The Rise of the Anti-corporate Movement: Corporations and the People who Hate Them'', Evan Osborne, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2007, page 14&lt;/ref&gt; Modern educational systems have also been criticized, by both the left and the right, for contributing to corporate brainwashing.&lt;ref&gt;''More Money Than Brains: Why School Sucks, College is Crap, &amp; Idiots Think They're Right'', [[Laura Penny]], McClelland &amp; Stewart, 20 April 2010, page 63.&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1992 book, ''Democracy in an Age of Corporate Colonization'', [[Stanley A. Deetz]] says that modern "[[self awareness]]" and "[[self improvement]]" programs provide corporations with even more effective tools to control the minds of employees than traditional brainwashing.&lt;ref&gt;''Democracy in an Age of Corporate Colonization: Developments in Communication and the Politics of Everyday Life'', Stanley Deetz, SUNY Press, 1 January 1992, page 257.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2000 book, ''Destroying the World to Save It: Aum Shinrikyo, Apocalyptic Violence, and the New Global Terrorism'', Robert Lifton applied his original ideas about thought reform to [[Aum Shinrikyo]] and the [[War on Terrorism]], concluding that in this context thought reform was possible without violence or physical coercion. He also pointed out that in their efforts against terrorism Western governments were also using some mind control techniques, including [[thought-terminating cliché]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Destroying the ''World to Save It: Aum Shinrikyo, Apocalyptic Violence, and the New Global Terrorism'', Owl Books, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

In her 2004 [[popular science]] book, ''[[Brainwashing: The Science of Thought Control]]'', [[neuroscientist]] and [[physiologist]] [[Kathleen Taylor (biologist)|Kathleen Taylor]] reviewed the history of mind control theories, as well as notable incidents.

A constant [[timbre]] at a constant pitch is characterized by a [[Frequency spectrum|spectrum]].
Along a piece of music, the spectrum measured within a narrow time window varies with the melody and the possible effects of instruments.
Therefore, it may seem paradoxical that a constant spectrum can be perceived as a melody rather than a stamp.
[[File:ConstantSpectrumMelody.ogg|thumb|Melody paradoxical constant spectrum]]

The paradox&lt;ref&gt;A. Chaigne (1988), “Psychoacoustique”, ENST, 114 pages.&lt;/ref&gt; is that the ear is not an abstract [[spectrogram|spectrograph]]: it "calculates" the [[Fourier transform]] of the [[sound signal]] in a narrow time window, but the slower variations are seen as temporal evolution and not as pitch.

However, the example of paradoxical melody above contains no infrasound (i.e. pure tone of period slower than the time window).
The second paradox is that when two pitches are very close, they create a [[Beat (acoustics)|beat]]. If the period of this beat is longer than the integration window, it is seen as a sinusoidal variation in the average rating: sin(2π(f+ε)t) + sin(2π(f-ε)t) = sin(2πft)cos(2πεt), where 1/ε is the slow period.
[[File:SpectreParadoxalZ.png|thumb|Spectrum of the paradoxical constant spectrum melody {{File:ConstantSpectrumMelody.ogg}}]]

The present spectrum is made of multiple frequencies beating together, resulting in a superimposition of various pitches fading in and out at different moments and pace, thus forming the melody.

== MATLAB/Scilab/Octave code ==

Here is the program used to generate the paradoxical melody:

 n=10; length=20; harmon=10; df=0.1; 
 t=(1:length*44100)/44100; 
 y=0; 
 for i = 0:n, 
   for j = 1:harmon, 
     y=y+sin(2*3.1415927*(55+i*df)*j*t); 
   end; 
 end;
 sound(y/(n*harmon),44100);

In [[mathematics]], a [[topological space]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a '''D-space''' if for any family &lt;math&gt;\{U_x:x\in X\}&lt;/math&gt; of [[open set]]s such that &lt;math&gt;x\in U_x&lt;/math&gt; for all points &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;, there is a closed discrete [[subset]] &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; of the [[space]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\bigcup_{x\in D}U_x=X&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Image:Northern Rock Queue.jpg|thumb|A 2007 run on Northern Rock, a British bank]]
The '''Diamond–Dybvig model''' is an influential [[Model (economics)|model]] of [[bank run]]s and related [[financial crisis|financial crises]]. The model shows how banks' mix of illiquid assets (such as business or mortgage loans) and liquid liabilities (deposits which may be withdrawn at any time) may give rise to self-fulfilling panics among  depositors.

==Theory==
The model, published in 1983 by [[Douglas W. Diamond]] of the [[University of Chicago]] and [[Philip H. Dybvig]], then of [[Yale University]] and now of [[Washington University in St. Louis]], shows how an institution with long-maturity assets and short-maturity liabilities can be unstable.

===Structure of the model===
Diamond and Dybvig's paper points out that business investment often requires expenditures in the present to obtain returns in the future.  Therefore, they prefer loans with a long [[Maturity (finance)|maturity]] (that is, low [[liquidity]]).  The same principle applies to individuals seeking financing to purchase large-ticket items such as [[House|housing]] or [[automobile]]s.  On the other hand, individual savers (both households and firms) may have sudden, unpredictable needs for cash, due to unforeseen expenditures.  So they demand [[Liquidity|liquid]] accounts which permit them immediate access to their deposits (that is, they value short [[Maturity (finance)|maturity]] deposit accounts).

The banks in the model act as intermediaries between savers who prefer to deposit in liquid accounts and borrowers who prefer to take out long-maturity loans.  Under ordinary circumstances, banks can provide a valuable service by channeling funds from many individual deposits into loans for borrowers.  Individual depositors might not be able to make these loans themselves, since they know they may suddenly need immediate access to their funds, whereas the businesses' investments will only pay off in the future (moreover, by aggregating funds from many different depositors, banks help depositors save on the [[transaction cost]]s they would have to pay in order to lend directly to businesses).  Since banks provide a valuable service to both sides (providing the long-maturity loans businesses want and the liquid accounts depositors want), they can charge a higher interest rate on loans than they pay on deposits and thus profit from the difference.

===Nash equilibria of the model===

Diamond and Dybvig point out that under ordinary circumstances, savers' unpredictable needs for cash are likely to be random, as depositors' needs reflect their individual circumstances. Since depositors' demand for cash are unlikely to occur at the same time, by accepting deposits from many different sources the bank expects only a small fraction of withdrawals in the short term, even though all depositors have the right to withdraw their full deposit at any time.  Thus, a bank can make loans over a long horizon, while keeping only relatively small amounts of cash on hand to pay any depositors that wish to make withdrawals. Mathematically, individual withdrawals are largely [[correlation|uncorrelated]], and by the [[law of large numbers]] banks expect a relatively stable number of withdrawals on any given day.

However a different outcome is also possible.  Since banks lend out at long maturity, they cannot quickly call in their loans.  And even if they tried to call in their loans, borrowers would be unable to pay back quickly, since their loans were, by assumption, used to finance long-term investments.  Therefore, if all depositors attempt to withdraw their funds simultaneously, a bank will run out of money long before it is able to pay all the depositors.  The bank will be able to pay the first depositors who demand their money back, but if all others attempt to withdraw too, the bank will go bankrupt and the last depositors will be left with nothing.

This means that even healthy banks are potentially vulnerable to panics, usually called [[bank run]]s.  If a depositor expects all other depositors to withdraw their funds, then it is irrelevant whether the banks' long term loans are likely to be profitable; the only rational response for the depositor is to rush to take his or her deposits out before the other depositors remove theirs.  In other words, the Diamond–Dybvig model views bank runs as a type of [[self-fulfilling prophecy]]: each depositor's incentive to withdraw funds depends on what they expect other depositors to do.  If enough depositors expect other depositors to withdraw their funds, then they all have an incentive to rush to be the first in line to withdraw their funds.

In theoretical terms, the Diamond–Dybvig model provides an example of an [[Game theory|economic game]] with more than one [[Nash equilibrium]].  If depositors expect most other depositors to withdraw only when they have real expenditure needs, then it is rational for all depositors to withdraw only when they have real expenditure needs.  But if depositors expect most other depositors to rush quickly to close their accounts, then it is rational for all depositors to rush quickly to close their accounts.  Of course, the first equilibrium is better than the second (in the sense of [[Pareto efficiency]]).  If depositors withdraw only when they have real expenditure needs, they all benefit from holding their savings in a liquid, interest-bearing account.  If instead everyone rushes to close their accounts, then they all lose the interest they could have earned, and some of them lose all their savings.  Nonetheless, it is not obvious what any one depositor could do to prevent this mutual loss.

==Policy implications==
In practice, due to [[fractional reserve banking]], banks faced with a bank run usually shut down and refuse to permit more withdrawals. This is called a ''suspension of convertibility'', and engenders further panic in the financial system.  While this may prevent some depositors who have a real need for cash from obtaining access to their money, it also prevents immediate bankruptcy, thus allowing the bank to wait for its loans to be repaid, so that it has enough resources to pay back some or all of its deposits.

However, Diamond and Dybvig argue that unless the total amount of real expenditure needs per period is known with certainty, suspension of convertibility cannot be the optimal mechanism for preventing bank runs.  Instead, they argue that a better way of preventing bank runs is [[deposit insurance]] backed by the government or [[central bank]].  Such insurance pays depositors all or part of their losses in the case of a bank run. If depositors know that they will get their money back even in case of a bank run, they have no reason to participate in a bank run.

Thus, sufficient deposit insurance can eliminate the possibility of bank runs.  In principle, maintaining a deposit insurance program is unlikely to be very costly for the government: as long as bank runs are prevented, deposit insurance will never actually need to be paid out. Bank runs became much rarer in the U.S. after the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] was founded in the aftermath of the bank panics of the [[Great Depression]].  On the other hand, a deposit insurance scheme is likely to lead to [[moral hazard]]: by protecting depositors against bank failure, it makes depositors less careful in choosing where to deposit their money, and thus gives banks less incentive to lend carefully.

'''Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging''' ('''DWI''' or '''DW-MRI''') is the use of specific [[MRI sequence]]s as well as software that generates images from the resulting data, that uses the diffusion of water molecules to generate [[contrast (vision)|contrast]] in MR images.&lt;ref name=LeBihan1985&gt;{{cite journal|last=Le Bihan|first=D |author2=E.

Molecular diffusion in tissues is not free, but reflects interactions with many obstacles, such as [[macromolecule]]s, fibers, and [[Biological membrane|membrane]]s. Water molecule diffusion patterns can therefore reveal microscopic details about tissue architecture, either normal or in a diseased state. A special kind of DWI, '''diffusion tensor imaging''' ('''DTI'''), has been used extensively to map [[white matter]] [[tractography]] in the brain.

== Introduction ==
In '''diffusion weighted imaging''' (DWI), the intensity of each image element ([[voxel]]) reflects the best estimate of the rate of water diffusion at that location. Because the mobility of water is driven by thermal agitation and highly dependent on its cellular environment, the hypothesis behind DWI is that findings may indicate (early) pathologic change. For instance, DWI is more sensitive to early changes after a stroke than more traditional MRI measurements such as [[T1 relaxation|T1]] or [[T2 relaxation]] rates. A variant of diffusion weighted imaging, '''diffusion spectrum imaging''' (DSI),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wedeen |first1=Van J. |last2=Hagmann |first2=Patric |last3=Tseng |first3=Wen-Yih Isaac |last4=Reese |first4=Timothy G. |last5=Weisskoff |first5=Robert M. |title=Mapping complex tissue architecture with diffusion spectrum magnetic resonance imaging |journal=Magnetic Resonance in Medicine |volume=54 |issue=6 |pages=1377–86 |year=2005 |pmid=16247738 |doi=10.1002/mrm.20642}}&lt;/ref&gt; was used in deriving the Connectome data sets; DSI is a variant of diffusion-weighted imaging that is sensitive to intra-voxel heterogeneities in diffusion directions caused by crossing fiber tracts and thus allows more accurate mapping of [[axon]]al trajectories than other diffusion imaging approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wedeen |first1=V.J. |last2=Wang |first2=R.P. |last3=Schmahmann |first3=J.D. |last4=Benner |first4=T. |last5=Tseng |first5=W.Y.I. |last6=Dai |first6=G. |last7=Pandya |first7=D.N. |last8=Hagmann |first8=P. |last9=D'arceuil |first9=H.  |title=Diffusion spectrum magnetic resonance imaging (DSI) tractography of crossing fibers |journal=NeuroImage |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=1267–77 |year=2008 |pmid=18495497 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2008.03.036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diffusion-weighted images are very useful to diagnose vascular strokes in the brain. It is also used more and more in the staging of [[Non-small cell lung cancer|non-small-cell lung cancer]], where it is a serious candidate to replace [[positron emission tomography]] as the 'gold standard' for this type of disease. Diffusion tensor imaging is being developed for studying the diseases of the [[white matter]] of the brain as well as for studies of other body tissues (see below). DWI is most applicable when the tissue of interest is dominated by isotropic water movement e.g. [[grey matter]] in the [[cerebral cortex]] and major brain nuclei, or in the body&amp;mdash;where the diffusion rate appears to be the same when measured along any axis. However, DWI also remains sensitive to T1 and T2 relaxation. To entangle diffusion and relaxation effects on image contrast, one may obtain quantitative images of the diffusion coefficient, or more exactly the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). The ADC concept was introduced to take into account the fact that the diffusion process is complex in biological tissues and reflects several different mechanisms.&lt;ref name=LeBihan1986&gt;{{cite journal|last=Le Bihan|first=D|author2=Breton, E|author3=Lallemand, D|author4=Grenier, P|author5=Cabanis, E|author6=Laval-Jeantet, M|title=MR imaging of intravoxel incoherent motions: application to diffusion and perfusion in neurologic disorders|journal=Radiology|year=1986|volume=161|issue=2|pages=401–7|pmid=3763909|doi=10.1148/radiology.161.2.3763909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Diffusion tensor imaging''' (DTI) is important when a tissue&amp;mdash;such as the neural [[axons]] of [[white matter]] in the brain or muscle fibers in the heart&amp;mdash;has an internal fibrous structure analogous to the [[anisotropy]] of some crystals. Water will then diffuse more rapidly in the direction aligned with the internal structure, and more slowly as it moves perpendicular to the preferred direction. This also means that the measured rate of diffusion will differ depending on the direction from which an observer is looking.

Traditionally, in diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), three gradient-directions are applied, sufficient to estimate the trace of the diffusion tensor or 'average diffusivity', a putative measure of [[edema]]. Clinically, trace-weighted images have proven to be very useful to diagnose vascular [[stroke]]s in the brain, by early detection (within a couple of minutes) of the hypoxic edema.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=Yudong|last2=Wang|first2=Shuihua|last3=Wu|first3=Lenan|last4=Huo|first4=Yuankai|title=Multi-channel diffusion tensor image registration via adaptive chaotic PSO|journal=Journal of Computers|date=Jan 2011|volume=6|issue=4|pages=825–829|doi=10.4304/jcp.6.4.825-829}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More extended DTI scans derive neural tract directional information from the data using 3D or multidimensional vector algorithms based on six or more gradient directions, sufficient to compute the diffusion [[tensor]]. The diffusion model is a rather simple model of the diffusion process, assuming homogeneity and linearity of the diffusion within each image voxel.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; From the diffusion tensor, diffusion anisotropy measures such as the [[fractional anisotropy]] (FA), can be computed. Moreover, the principal direction of the diffusion tensor can be used to infer the white-matter connectivity of the brain (i.e. [[tractography]]; trying to see which part of the brain is connected to which other part).

Recently, more advanced models of the diffusion process have been proposed that aim to overcome the weaknesses of the diffusion tensor model. Amongst others, these include q-space imaging &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Mechanism==
Diffusion imaging is an [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] method that produces in vivo magnetic resonance images of biological tissues sensitized with the local characteristics of molecular diffusion, generally water (but other [[Moiety (chemistry)|moieties]] can also be investigated using MR spectroscopic approaches).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Posse|first=S |author2=Cuenod, CA |author3=Le Bihan, D|title=Human brain: proton diffusion MR spectroscopy.|journal=Radiology|year=1993|volume=188|issue=3|pages=719–25|pmid=8351339|doi=10.1148/radiology.188.3.8351339}}&lt;/ref&gt;
MRI can be made sensitive to the motion of molecules. Regular MRI acquisition utilizes the behaviour of protons in water to generate contrast between clinically relevant features of a particular subject. The versatile nature of MRI is due to this capability of producing contrast related to the structure of tissues at microscopic level. In a typical &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt;-weighted image, water molecules in a sample are excited with the imposition of a strong magnetic field. This causes many of the protons in water molecules to precess simultaneously, producing signals in MRI. In &lt;math&gt;T_2&lt;/math&gt;-weighted images, contrast is produced by measuring the loss of coherence or synchrony between the water protons. When water is in an environment where it can freely tumble, relaxation tends to take longer. In certain clinical situations, this can generate contrast between an area of pathology and the surrounding healthy tissue.

To sensitize MRI images to diffusion, instead of a homogeneous magnetic field, the homogeneity is varied linearly by a pulsed field gradient. Since precession is proportional to the magnet strength, the protons begin to precess at different rates, resulting in dispersion of the phase and signal loss. Another gradient pulse is applied in the same magnitude but with opposite direction to refocus or rephase the spins. The refocusing will not be perfect for protons that have moved during the time interval between the pulses, and the signal measured by the MRI machine is reduced. This "field gradient pulse" method was initially devised for NMR by Stejskal and Tanner  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stejskal|first=E. O.|author2=Tanner, J. E.|title=Spin Diffusion Measurements: Spin Echoes in the Presence of a Time-Dependent Field Gradient|journal=The Journal of Chemical Physics|date=1 January 1965|volume=42|issue=1|pages=288|doi=10.1063/1.1695690|bibcode = 1965JChPh..42..288S }}&lt;/ref&gt; who derived the reduction in signal due to the application of the pulse gradient related to the amount of diffusion that is occurring through the following equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{S(TE)}{S_0} =  \exp \left[ -\gamma^2 G^2\delta^2 \left( \Delta-\frac{\delta}{3}\right)D \right]&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; S_0 &lt;/math&gt; is the signal intensity without the diffusion weighting, &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the signal with the gradient, &lt;math&gt; \gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gyromagnetic ratio]], &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the strength of the gradient pulse, &lt;math&gt; \delta&lt;/math&gt; is the duration of the pulse, &lt;math&gt; \Delta&lt;/math&gt; is the time between the two pulses, and finally, &lt;math&gt; D&lt;/math&gt; is the diffusion-coefficient.

In order to localize this signal attenuation to get images of diffusion one has to combine the pulsed magnetic field gradient pulses used for MRI (aimed at localization of the signal, but those gradient pulses are too weak to produce a diffusion related attenuation) with additional "motion-probing" gradient pulses, according to the Stejskal and Tanner method. This combination is not trivial, as cross-terms arise between all gradient pulses. The equation set by Stejskal and Tanner then becomes inaccurate and the signal attenuation must be calculated, either analytically or numerically, integrating all gradient pulses present in the MRI sequence and their interactions. The result quickly becomes very complex given the many pulses present in the MRI sequence and, as a simplication, Le Bihan suggested to gather all the gradient terms in a "b factor" (which depends only on the acquisition parameters), so that the signal attenuation simply becomes:&lt;ref name=LeBihan1985 /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{S(TE)}{S_0} =  \exp (-b\cdot ADC)&lt;/math&gt;

Also, the diffusion coefficient, &lt;math&gt; D&lt;/math&gt;, is replaced by an apparent diffusion coefficient, &lt;math&gt; ADC&lt;/math&gt;, to indicate that the diffusion process is not free in tissues, but hindered and modulated by many mechanisms (restriction in closed spaces, tortuosity around obstacles, etc.) and that other sources of IntraVoxel Incoherent Motion (IVIM) such as blood flow in small vessels or cerebrospinal fluid in ventricles also contribute to the signal attenuation.
At the end, images are "weighted" by the diffusion process:  In those diffusion-weighted images (DWI) the signal is more attenuated the faster the diffusion and the larger the b factor is. However, those diffusion-weighted images are still also sensitive to T1 and T2 relaxivity contrast, which can sometimes be confusing. It is possible to calculate "pure" diffusion maps (or more exactly ADC maps where the ADC is the sole source of contrast) by collecting images with at least 2 different values, &lt;math&gt;b_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b_2&lt;/math&gt;, of the b factor according to:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{ADC}(x,y,z)= \ln [S_2(x,y,z)/S_1(x,y,z)]/(b_1-b_2)&lt;/math&gt;

Although this ADC concept has been extremely successful, especially for clinical applications, it has been challenged recently, as new, more comprehensive models of diffusion in biological tissues have been introduced. Those models have been made necessary, as diffusion in tissues is not free. In this condition, the ADC seems to depend on the choice of b values (the ADC seems to decrease when using larger b values), as the plot of ln(S/So) is not linear with the b factor, as expected from the above equations. This deviation from a free diffusion behavior is what makes diffusion MRI so successful, as the ADC is very sensitive to changes in tissue microstructure. On the other hand, modeling diffusion in tissues is becoming very complex. Among most popular models are the biexponential model, which assumes the presence of 2 water pools in slow or intermediate exchange &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Niendorf T, Dijkhuizen RM, Norris DG, van Lookeren Campagne M, Nicolay K|title= Biexponential Diffusion Attenuation in Various States of Brain Tissue : Implications for Diffusion-Weighted Imaging |journal=Magnetic Resonance in Medicine|year=1996|volume=36|pages=847–857|doi=10.1002/mrm.1910360607|pmid=8946350|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Karger|first=J|author2=Pfeifer, H|author3=Heink, W|title= Principles and application of self-diffusion measurements by nuclear magnetic resonance |journal= Advances in Magnetic Resonance |year=1988|volume=12|pages=1–89|doi=10.1016/b978-0-12-025512-2.50004-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the cumulant-expansion (also called Kurtosis) model &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liu|first=C|author2=Bammer, R|author3=Moseley, ME|title=Generalized Diffusion Tensor Imaging (GDTI): A Method for Characterizing and Imaging Diffusion Anisotropy Caused by Non-Gaussian Diffusion|journal=Israel Journal of Chemistry|year=2003|volume=43|issue=1–2|pages=145–54|doi=10.1560/HB5H-6XBR-1AW1-LNX9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chabert2004&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chabert|first=S |author2=Mecca, CC |author3=Le Bihan D|title= Relevance of the information about the diffusion distribution in invo given by kurtosis in q-space imaging |journal= Proceedings, 12th ISMRM annual meeting, (Kyoto)|year=2004|pages=1238}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jensen|first=JH |author2=Helpern, JA |author3=Ramani, A |author4=Lu, H |author5=Kaczynski, K|title=Diffusional kurtosis imaging: the quantification of non-gaussian water diffusion by means of magnetic resonance imaging|journal=Magnetic Resonance in Medicine|year=2005|volume=53|issue=6|pages=1432–40|pmid=15906300|doi=10.1002/mrm.20508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; J(x,t)=-D\nabla\rho(x,t) &lt;/math&gt;

where D is the [[diffusion coefficient]]. Then, given conservation of mass, the [[continuity equation]] relates the time derivative of the concentration with the [[divergence]] of the flux:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial\rho(x,t)}{\partial t}=-\nabla\cdot J(x,t) &lt;/math&gt;

Putting the two together, we get the [[diffusion equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial\rho(x,t)}{\partial t}=D\nabla^2\rho(x,t). &lt;/math&gt;

=== Magnetization dynamics ===

With no diffusion present, the change in nuclear [[magnetization]] over time is given by the classical [[Bloch equation]]

:&lt;math&gt;  \frac{d{M}}{dt}=\gamma{M}\times{B}-\frac{M_x\vec{i}+M_y\vec{j}}{T_2}-\frac{(M_z-M_0)\vec{k}}{T_1} &lt;/math&gt;

which has terms for precession, T2 relaxation, and T1 relaxation.

In 1956, [[H.C. Torrey]] mathematically showed how the [[Bloch equations]] for magnetization would change with the addition of diffusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.104.563 |bibcode=1956PhRv..104..563T |title=Bloch Equations with Diffusion Terms |year=1956 |last1=Torrey |first1=H. C. |journal=Physical Review |volume=104 |pages=563–565 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Torrey modified Bloch's original description of transverse magnetization to include diffusion terms and the application of a spatially varying gradient.  Since the magnetization &lt;math&gt; M &lt;/math&gt; is a vector, there are 3 diffusion equations, one for each dimension.  The '''Bloch&amp;ndash;Torrey equation''' is:

:&lt;math&gt;  \frac{d{M}}{dt}=\gamma{M}\times{B}-\frac{M_x\vec{i}+M_y\vec{j}}{T_2}-\frac{(M_z-M_0)\vec{k}}{T_1}+\nabla\cdot D\nabla{M} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; D &lt;/math&gt; is now the diffusion tensor.

For the simplest case where the diffusion is isotropic the diffusion tensor is a multiple of the identity:

:&lt;math&gt;{D} = D \cdot \vec {I} = D \cdot \begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix},&lt;/math&gt;

then the Bloch&amp;ndash;Torrey equation will have the solution

:&lt;math&gt;  {M}={M}_{\text{bloch}}e^{-\frac13\gamma^2G^2t^3D}\sim e^{-bD_0} &lt;/math&gt;

The exponential term will be referred to as the ''attenuation'' &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt;. Anisotropic diffusion will have a similar solution for the diffusion tensor, except that what will be measured is the ''apparent diffusion coefficient'' (ADC). In general, the attenuation is:

:&lt;math&gt;  A=e^{ -\sum_{i,j}b_{ij}D_{ij} } &lt;/math&gt;

where the &lt;math&gt; b_{ij} &lt;/math&gt; terms incorporate the gradient fields &lt;math&gt; G_x, &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; G_y &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; G_z &lt;/math&gt;.

==ADC image==
[[File:Cerebral infarction after 4 hours on ADC MRI.jpg|thumb|150px|ADC image of the same case of cerebral infarction as seen on DWI in section above.]]
An ''apparent diffusion coefficient'' (ADC) image or an ''ADC map'' is an MRI image that more specifically shows diffusion than conventional DWI, by eliminating the [[T2-weighted imaging|T2 weighing]] that is otherwise inherent in conventional DWI.&lt;ref name=hammer&gt;{{cite web |url= http://xrayphysics.com/dwi.html#adc |title= MRI Physics: Diffusion-Weighted Imaging |author= Mark Hammer |website= XRayPhysics |accessdate= 2017-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; ADC imaging does so by acquiring multiple conventional DWI images with different amounts of DWI weighing, and the change in signal is proportional to the rate of diffusion. Contrary to DWI images, the standard grayscale of ADC images is to represent a smaller magnitude of diffusion as darker.&lt;ref name=mriquestions/&gt;

[[Cerebral infarction]] leads to diffusion restriction, and the difference between images with various DWI weighing will therefore be minor, leading to an ADC image with low signal in the infarcted area.&lt;ref name=hammer/&gt; A decreased ADC may be detected minutes after a cerebral infarction.&lt;ref name="AnFord2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=An|first1=H.|last2=Ford|first2=A.

==Diffusion tensor imaging==
Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a magnetic resonance imaging technique that enables the measurement of the restricted diffusion of water in tissue in order to produce neural tract images instead of using this data solely for the purpose of assigning contrast or colors to pixels in a cross sectional image. It also provides useful structural information about muscle—including heart muscle—as well as other tissues such as the prostate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=17507813 |year=2007 |author1=Manenti |first2=M |first3=S |first4=V |first5=M |first6=E |first7=G |title=Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging of prostate cancer |volume=42 |issue=6 |pages=412–9 |doi=10.1097/01.rli.0000264059.46444.bf |journal=Investigative radiology |last2=Carlani |last3=Mancino |last4=Colangelo |last5=Di Roma |last6=Squillaci |last7=Simonetti}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In DTI, each voxel has one or more pairs of parameters: a rate of diffusion and a preferred direction of diffusion&amp;mdash;described in terms of three-dimensional space&amp;mdash;for which that parameter is valid. The properties of each voxel of a single DTI image is usually calculated by vector or tensor math from six or more different diffusion weighted acquisitions, each obtained with a different orientation of the diffusion sensitizing gradients. In some methods, hundreds of measurements&amp;mdash;each making up a complete image&amp;mdash;are made to generate a single resulting calculated image data set. The higher information content of a DTI voxel makes it extremely sensitive to subtle pathology in the brain. In addition the directional information can be exploited at a higher level of structure to select and follow neural tracts through the brain&amp;mdash;a process called [[tractography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Basser|first=P. J.|last2=Pajevic|first2=S.|last3=Pierpaoli|first3=C.|last4=Duda|first4=J.|last5=Aldroubi|first5=A.|date=2000-10-01|title=In vivo fiber tractography using DT-MRI data|journal=Magnetic Resonance in Medicine|volume=44|issue=4|pages=625–632|issn=0740-3194|pmid=11025519|doi=10.1002/1522-2594(200010)44:4&lt;625::AID-MRM17&gt;3.0.CO;2-O}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more precise statement of the image acquisition process is that the image-intensities at each position are attenuated, depending on the strength (''b''-value) and direction of the so-called magnetic diffusion gradient, as well as on the local microstructure in which the water molecules diffuse. The more attenuated the image is at a given position, the greater diffusion there is in the direction of the diffusion gradient. In order to measure the tissue's complete diffusion profile, one needs to repeat the MR scans, applying different directions (and possibly strengths) of the diffusion gradient for each scan.

=== Measures of anisotropy and diffusivity ===
[[File:DTI-axial-ellipsoids.jpg|thumb|Visualization of DTI data with ellipsoids.]]
In present-day clinical neurology, various brain pathologies may be best detected by looking at particular measures of anisotropy and diffusivity. The underlying physical process of [[diffusion]] causes a group of water molecules to move out from a central point, and gradually reach the surface of an [[ellipsoid]] if the medium is anisotropic (it would be the surface of a sphere for an isotropic medium). The ellipsoid formalism functions also as a mathematical method of organizing tensor data. Measurement of an ellipsoid tensor further permits a retrospective analysis, to gather information about the process of diffusion in each voxel of the tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Le Bihan|first=D|author2=Mangin JF |author3=Poupon C |author4=Clark CA |author5=Pappata S |author6=Molko N |title=Diffusion Tensor Imaging: Concepts and Applications|journal=JMRI|volume=66 |issue=13 |pages=534–546 |year=2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an isotropic medium such as [[cerebro-spinal fluid]], water molecules are moving due to diffusion and they move at equal rates in all directions. By knowing the detailed effects of diffusion gradients we can generate a formula that allows us to convert the signal [[attenuation]] of an MRI voxel into a numerical measure of diffusion&amp;mdash;the [[diffusion coefficient]] ''D''. When various barriers and restricting factors such as [[cell membrane]]s and [[microtubule]]s interfere with the free diffusion, we are measuring an "apparent diffusion coefficient" or '''ADC''' because the measurement misses all the local effects and treats it as if all the movement rates were solely due to Brownian motion. The ADC in anisotropic tissue varies depending on the direction in which it is measured. Diffusion is fast along the length of (parallel to) an [[axon]], and slower perpendicularly across it.

Once we have measured the voxel from six or more directions and corrected for attenuations due to T2 and T1 effects, we can use information from our calculated ellipsoid tensor to describe what is happening in the voxel.  If you consider an ellipsoid sitting at an angle in a [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian]] grid then you can consider the projection of that ellipse onto the three axes. The three projections can give you the ADC along each of the three axes ADC&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, ADC&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;, ADC&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;. This leads to the idea of describing the average diffusivity in the voxel which will simply be

:&lt;math&gt;
(ADC_x + ADC_y + ADC_z)/3 = ADC_i
&lt;/math&gt;

We use the ''i'' subscript to signify that this is what the isotropic diffusion coefficient would be with the effects of anisotropy averaged out.

The ellipsoid itself has a principal long axis and then two more small axes that describe its width and depth. All three of these are perpendicular to each other and cross at the center point of the ellipsoid. We call the axes in this setting '''[[eigenvectors]]''' and the measures of their lengths '''[[eigenvalues]]'''. The lengths are symbolized by the Greek letter ''[[lambda|λ]]''. The long one pointing along the axon direction will be ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and the two small axes will have lengths ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  and ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. In the setting of the DTI tensor ellipsoid, we can consider each of these as a measure of the diffusivity along each of the three primary axes of the ellipsoid. This is a little different from the ADC since that was a projection on the axis, while ''λ'' is an actual measurement of the ellipsoid we have calculated.

The diffusivity along the principal axis, ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is also called the longitudinal diffusivity or the '''axial diffusivity''' or even the parallel diffusivity ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;∥&lt;/sub&gt;. Historically, this is closest to what Richards originally measured with the vector length in 1991.&lt;ref name="Richards1992"&gt;Richards TL, Heide AC, Tsuruda JS, Alvord EC: Vector analysis of diffusion images in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. Presented at Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine, Berlin, SMRM Proceedings 11:412, 1992 (abstr).&lt;/ref&gt; The diffusivities in the two minor axes are often averaged to produce a measure of '''radial diffusivity'''

:&lt;math&gt;
\lambda_{\perp} = (\lambda_2 + \lambda_3)/2 .
&lt;/math&gt;

This quantity is an assessment of the degree of restriction due to membranes and other effects and proves to be a sensitive measure of degenerative pathology in some neurological conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vaillancourt DE, Spraker MB, Prodoehl J |display-authors=etal |title=High-resolution diffusion tensor imaging in the substantia nigra of de novo Parkinson disease |journal=Neurology |volume=72  |pages=1378&amp;ndash;1384 |year=2009 |doi=10.1212/01.wnl.0000340982.01727.6e |pmid=19129507 |issue=16 |pmc=2677508}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be called the perpendicular diffusivity (&lt;math&gt;
\lambda_{\perp}&lt;/math&gt;).

Another commonly used measure that summarizes the total diffusivity is the '''Trace'''&amp;mdash;which is the sum of the three eigenvalues,

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{tr}(\Lambda) = \lambda_1 + \lambda_2 + \lambda_3
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\lambda_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda_3&lt;/math&gt; on its diagonal.

If we divide this sum by three we have the '''mean diffusivity''',

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{MD} = (\lambda_1 + \lambda_2 + \lambda_3) /3
&lt;/math&gt;

which equals ''ADC&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' since
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\mathrm{tr}(\Lambda)/3 &amp;= \mathrm{tr}(V V^{-1} \Lambda)/3 \\
&amp;= \mathrm{tr}(V \Lambda V^{-1})/3 \\ 
&amp;= \mathrm{tr}(D)/3 \\
&amp;= ADC_i
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the matrix of eigenvectors and &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the diffusion tensor.
Aside from describing the amount of diffusion, it is often important to describe the relative degree of anisotropy in a voxel. At one extreme would be the sphere of isotropic diffusion and at the other extreme would be a cigar or pencil shaped very thin [[prolate spheroid]]. The simplest measure is obtained by dividing the longest axis of the ellipsoid by the shortest =&amp;nbsp;(''λ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/''λ''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). However, this proves to be very susceptible to measurement noise, so increasingly complex measures were developed to capture the measure while minimizing the noise.  An important element of these calculations is the sum of squares of the diffusivity differences =&amp;nbsp;(''λ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''λ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;(''λ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''λ''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;(''λ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''λ''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. We use the square root of the sum of squares to obtain a sort of weighted average—dominated by the largest component. One objective is to keep the number near 0 if the voxel is spherical but near 1 if it is elongate. This leads to the '''[[fractional anisotropy]]''' or '''FA''' which is the square root of the sum of squares (SRSS) of the diffusivity differences, divided by the SRSS of the diffusivities. When the second and third axes are small relative to the principal axis, the number in the numerator is almost equal the number in the denominator. We also multiply by &lt;math&gt;1/\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; so that FA has a maximum value of 1. The whole formula for '''FA''' looks like this:

:&lt;math&gt;  \mathrm{FA}=\frac{\sqrt{3( (\lambda_1-\operatorname E[\lambda])^2+(\lambda_2-\operatorname E[\lambda])^2+(\lambda_3-\operatorname E[\lambda])^2 )}}{\sqrt{2( \lambda_1^2+\lambda_2^2+\lambda_3^2 )}} &lt;/math&gt;

The fractional anisotropy can also be separated into linear, planar, and spherical measures depending on the "shape" of the diffusion ellipsoid.&lt;ref&gt;Westin CF, Peled S, Gudbjartsson H, Kikinis R, Jolesz FA. Geometrical diffusion measures for MRI from tensor basis analysis. In ISMRM '97. Vancouver Canada, 1997;1742.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Westin CF, Maier SE, Mamata H, Nabavi A, Jolesz FA, Kikinis R. Processing and visualization of diffusion tensor MRI. Medical Image Analysis 2002;6(2):93-108.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a "cigar" shaped prolate ellipsoid indicates a strongly linear anisotropy, a "flying saucer" or [[oblate spheroid]] represents diffusion in a plane, and a sphere is indicative of isotropic diffusion, equal in all directions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Andrew L. Alexander |title=Diffusion Tensor Imaging of the Brain |year=2008 |pmc=2041910 |pmid=17599699 |doi=10.1016/j.nurt.2007.05.011 |volume=4 |journal=Neurotherapeutics |pages=316–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the eigenvalues of the diffusion vector are sorted such that &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1 \geq \lambda_2 \geq \lambda_3 \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;, then the measures can be calculated as follows:

For the '''linear case''', where &lt;math&gt; \lambda_1 \gg \lambda_2 \simeq \lambda_3 &lt;/math&gt;,

: &lt;math&gt;
C_l=\frac{\lambda_1 - \lambda_2}{\lambda_1 + \lambda_2 + \lambda_3}
&lt;/math&gt;

For the '''planar case''', where &lt;math&gt; \lambda_1 \simeq \lambda_2 \gg \lambda_3 
&lt;/math&gt;,

: &lt;math&gt;
     C_p=\frac{2(\lambda_2 - \lambda_3)}{\lambda_1 + \lambda_2 + \lambda_3}
   &lt;/math&gt;

For the '''spherical case''', where &lt;math&gt; \lambda_1 \simeq \lambda_2 \simeq \lambda_3 &lt;/math&gt;,

: &lt;math&gt;
     C_s=\frac{3\lambda_3}{\lambda_1 + \lambda_2 + \lambda_3}
   &lt;/math&gt;

Each measure lies between 0 and 1 and they sum to unity. An additional '''anisotropy measure''' can used to describe the deviation from the spherical case:

: &lt;math&gt;
     C_a=C_l+C_p=1-C_s=\frac{\lambda_1 + \lambda_2 - 2\lambda_3}{\lambda_1 + \lambda_2 + \lambda_3}
   &lt;/math&gt;

There are other metrics of anisotropy used, including the ''relative anisotropy'' (RA):

:&lt;math&gt;  \mathrm{RA}=\frac{\sqrt{(\lambda_1-\operatorname E[\lambda])^2+(\lambda_2-\operatorname E[\lambda])^2+(\lambda_3-\operatorname E[\lambda])^2}}{\sqrt{3}\operatorname E[\lambda]} &lt;/math&gt;

and the ''volume ratio'' (VR):

:&lt;math&gt;  \mathrm{VR}=\frac{\lambda_1\lambda_2\lambda_3}{\operatorname E[\lambda]^3} &lt;/math&gt;

===Applications===
{{refimprove section|date=December 2013}}
The principal application is in the imaging of [[white matter]] where the location, orientation, and [[anisotropy]] of the tracts can be measured. The architecture of the [[axon]]s in parallel bundles, and their [[myelin]] sheaths, facilitate the [[diffusion]] of the water molecules preferentially along their main direction. Such preferentially oriented diffusion is called '''anisotropic diffusion'''.

[[Image:DTI-sagittal-fibers.jpg|thumb|240px|Tractographic reconstruction of neural connections via DTI]]
The imaging of this property is an extension of diffusion MRI. If a series of diffusion gradients (i.e. [[magnetic field]] variations in the MRI magnet) are applied that can determine at least 3 directional vectors (use of 6 different gradients is the minimum and additional gradients improve the accuracy for "off-diagonal" information), it is possible to calculate, for each [[voxel]], a [[tensor]] (i.e. a symmetric positive definite 3&amp;times;3 [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]) that describes the 3-dimensional shape of diffusion.  The fiber direction is indicated by the tensor's main [[eigenvector]]. This vector can be color-coded, yielding a cartography of the tracts' position and direction (red for left-right, blue for superior-inferior, and green for anterior-posterior).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Makris|first=N.|last2=Worth|first2=A.

Mean diffusivity (MD) or trace is a scalar measure of the total diffusion within a voxel. These measures are commonly used clinically to localize white matter lesions that do not show up on other forms of clinical MRI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Edward Soll |url=http://www.doctorsimaging.com/services-in-metairie-new-orleans-louisiana/dti-mtbi-mild-traumatic-brain-injury-concussions-scan/ |title=DTI (Quantitative), a new and advanced MRI procedure for evaluation of Concussions |year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diffusion tensor imaging data can be used to perform [[tractography]] within white matter. Fiber tracking algorithms can be used to track a fiber along its whole length (e.g. the [[corticospinal tract]], through which the motor information transit from the [[motor cortex]] to the [[spinal cord]] and the peripheral [[nerve]]s).  Tractography is a useful tool for measuring deficits in white matter, such as in aging.  Its estimation of fiber orientation and strength is increasingly accurate, and it has widespread potential implications in the fields of cognitive neuroscience and neurobiology.

Some clinical applications of DTI are in the tract-specific localization of white matter [[lesion]]s such as trauma and in defining the severity of [[Traumatic brain injury#Focal vs. diffused|diffuse traumatic brain injury]].   The localization of [[tumor]]s in relation to the white matter tracts (infiltration, deflection), has been one of the most important initial applications. In surgical planning for some types of [[brain tumors]], surgery is aided by knowing the proximity and relative position of the [[corticospinal tract]] and a tumor.

The use of DTI for the assessment of white matter in development, pathology and degeneration has been the focus of over 2,500 research publications since 2005. It promises to be very helpful in distinguishing [[Alzheimer's disease]] from other types of [[dementia]]. Applications in brain research cover e.g. connectionistic investigation of [[neural network]]s [[in vivo]].

DTI also has applications in the characterization of [[skeletal muscle|skeletal]] and [[cardiac muscle]].  The sensitivity to fiber orientation also appears to be helpful in the area of [[sports medicine]] where it greatly aids imaging of structure and injury in [[muscle]]s and [[tendon]]s.

==Mathematical foundation&amp;mdash;tensors==
{{see also|Principal axis theorem}}
Diffusion MRI relies on the mathematics and physical interpretations of the geometric quantities known as [[tensor]]s. Only a special case of the general mathematical notion is relevant to imaging, which is based on the concept of a [[symmetric matrix]].&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Several full mathematical treatments of general tensors exist, e.g. [[classical treatment of tensors|classical]], [[Component-free treatment of tensors|component free]], and so on, but the generality, which covers arrays of all sizes, may obscure rather than help.&lt;/ref&gt;  Diffusion itself is tensorial, but in many cases the objective is not really about trying to study brain diffusion per se, but rather just trying to take advantage of diffusion anisotropy in white matter for the purpose of finding the orientation of the axons and the magnitude or degree of anisotropy. Tensors have a real, physical existence in a material or tissue so that they don't move when the coordinate system used to describe them is rotated.  There are numerous different possible representations of a tensor (of rank 2), but among these, this discussion focuses on the ellipsoid because of its physical relevance to diffusion and because of its historical significance in the development of diffusion anisotropy imaging in MRI.

The following matrix displays the components of the diffusion tensor:

:&lt;math&gt; \bar{D} = \begin{vmatrix}
D_{\color{red}xx} &amp; D_{xy} &amp; D_{xz} \\
D_{xy} &amp; D_{\color{red}yy} &amp; D_{yz} \\
D_{xz} &amp; D_{yz} &amp; D_{\color{red}zz}
\end{vmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The same matrix of numbers can have a simultaneous second use to describe the shape and orientation of an ellipse and the same matrix of numbers can be used simultaneously in a third way for matrix mathematics to sort out eigenvectors and eigenvalues as explained below.

===Physical tensors===
The idea of a tensor in physical science evolved from attempts to describe the quantity of physical properties. The first properties they were applied to were those that can be described by a single number, such as temperature. Properties that can be described this way are called [[Scalar (mathematics)|scalars]]; these can be considered tensors of rank 0, or 0th-order tensors. Tensors can also be used to describe quantities that have directionality, such as mechanical force. These quantities require specification of both magnitude and direction, and are often represented with a [[Euclidean vector|vector]]. A three-dimensional vector can be described with three components: its projection on the ''x,'' ''y'', and ''z'' axes. Vectors of this sort can be considered tensors of rank 1, or 1st-order tensors.

A tensor is often a physical or biophysical property that determines the relationship between two vectors. When a force is applied to an object, movement can result. If the movement is in a single direction, the transformation can be described using a vector—a tensor of rank 1. However, in a tissue, diffusion leads to movement of water molecules along trajectories that proceed along multiple directions over time, leading to a complex projection onto the Cartesian axes. This pattern is reproducible if the same conditions and forces are applied to the same tissue in the same way. If there is an internal anisotropic organization of the tissue that constrains diffusion, then this fact will be reflected in the pattern of diffusion. The relationship between the properties of driving force that generate diffusion of the water molecules and the resulting pattern of their movement in the tissue can be described by a tensor. The collection of molecular displacements of this physical property can be described with nine components—each one associated with a pair of axes ''xx'', ''yy'', ''zz'', ''xy'', ''yx'', ''xz'', ''zx'', ''yz'', ''zy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nye JF |title=Physical Properties of Crystals: Their Representations by Tensors and Matrices |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1957}}&lt;/ref&gt; These can be written as a matrix similar to the one at the start of this section.

Diffusion from a point source in the anisotropic medium of white matter behaves in a similar fashion. The first pulse of the Stejskal Tanner diffusion gradient effectively labels some water molecules and the second pulse effectively shows their displacement due to diffusion. Each gradient direction applied measures the movement along the direction of that gradient. Six or more gradients are summed to get all the measurements needed to fill in the matrix, assuming it is symmetric above and below the diagonal (red subscripts).

In 1848, [[Henri Hureau de Sénarmont]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=de Sénarmont HH: |title=Mémoire sur la conductibilité des substances cristalisées pour la chaleur |journal=Comptes rendus hebdomadaires des séances de l'Académie des Sciences|volume=25 |pages=459–461 |year=1848}}&lt;/ref&gt; applied a heated point to a polished crystal surface that had been coated with wax. In some materials that had "isotropic" structure, a ring of melt would spread across the surface in a circle. In anisotropic crystals the spread took the form of an ellipse. In three dimensions this spread is an ellipsoid. As [[Adolf Eugen Fick|Adolf Fick]] showed in the 1850s, diffusion exhibits many of the same patterns as those seen in the transfer of heat.

===Mathematics of ellipsoids===
At this point, it is helpful to consider the mathematics of ellipsoids. An ellipsoid can be described by the formula: ''ax''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ ''by''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ ''cz''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 1. This equation describes a [[quadric]] surface. The relative values of ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' determine if the quadric describes an [[ellipsoid]] or a [[hyperboloid]].

As it turns out, three more components can be added as follows: ''ax''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ ''by''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ ''cz''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ ''dyz''&amp;nbsp;+ ''ezx''&amp;nbsp;+ ''fxy''&amp;nbsp;= 1. Many combinations of ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'', ''e'',  and ''f''  still describe ellipsoids, but the additional components (''d'', ''e'', ''f'') describe the rotation of the ellipsoid relative to the orthogonal axes of the Cartesian coordinate system. These six variables can be represented by a matrix similar to the tensor matrix defined at the start of this section (since diffusion is symmetric, then we only need six instead of nine components—the components below the diagonal elements of the matrix are the same as the components above the diagonal). This is what is meant when it is stated that the components of a matrix of a second order tensor can be represented by an ellipsoid—if the diffusion values of the six terms of the quadric ellipsoid are placed into the matrix, this generates an ellipsoid angled off the orthogonal grid. Its shape will be more elongated if the relative anisotropy is high.

When the ellipsoid/tensor is represented by a [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]], we can apply a useful technique from standard matrix mathematics and linear algebra—that is to "[[Diagonalizable matrix#How to diagonalize a matrix|diagonalize]]" the matrix. This has two important meanings in imaging. The idea is that there are two equivalent ellipsoids—of identical shape but with different size and orientation. The first one is the measured diffusion ellipsoid sitting at an angle determined by the axons, and the second one is perfectly aligned with the three [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian]] axes. The term "diagonalize" refers to the three components of the matrix along a diagonal from upper left to lower right (the components with red subscripts in the matrix at the start of this section). The variables ''ax''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''by''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and ''cz''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; are along the diagonal (red subscripts), but the variables ''d'', ''e'' and ''f'' are "off diagonal". It then becomes possible to do a vector processing step in which we rewrite our matrix and replace it with a new matrix multiplied by three different vectors of unit length (length=1.0). The matrix is diagonalized because the off-diagonal components are all now zero. The rotation angles required to get to this equivalent position now appear in the three vectors and can be read out as the ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' components of each of them. Those three vectors are called "[[eigenvectors]]" or characteristic vectors. They contain the orientation information of the original ellipsoid. The three axes of the ellipsoid are now directly along the main orthogonal axes of the coordinate system so we can easily infer their lengths. These lengths are the eigenvalues or characteristic values.

[[Diagonalizable matrix|Diagonalization]] of a matrix is done by finding a second matrix that it can be multiplied with followed by multiplication by the inverse of the second matrix—wherein the result is a new matrix in which three diagonal (''xx'', ''yy'', ''zz'') components have numbers in them but the off-diagonal components (''xy'', ''yz'', ''zx'') are 0. The second matrix provides [[eigenvector]] information.

==Beyond DTI==
Early in the development of DTI based tractography, a number of researchers pointed out a flaw in the diffusion tensor model. The tensor analysis assumes that there is a single ellipsoid in each imaging voxel&amp;mdash; as if all of the axons traveling through a voxel traveled in exactly the same direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tuch DS |title=Q-Ball Imaging |journal=Magn. Res. Med. |volume=52 |pages=1358&amp;ndash;1372 |year=2004 |doi=10.1002/mrm.20279 |pmid=15562495}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is often true, but it can be estimated that in more than 30% of the voxels in a standard resolution brain image, there are at least two different neural tracts traveling in different directions that pass through each other. In the classic diffusion ellipsoid tensor model, the information from the crossing tract just appears as noise or unexplained decreased anisotropy in a given voxel. David Tuch was among the first to describe a solution to this problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tuch DS, Weisskoff RM, Belliveau JW, Wedeen VJ |title=High angular resolution diffusion imaging of the human brain |journal=Proceedings of the 7th Annual Meeting of the ISMRM, Philadelphia |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tuch DS, Reese TG, Wiegell MR |display-authors=etal |title=High angular resolution diffusion imaging reveals intravoxel white matter fiber heterogeneity |journal=Magn. Res. Med. |volume=48 |pages=577&amp;ndash;582 |year=2002 |doi=10.1002/mrm.10268 |pmid=12353272 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is best understood by conceptually placing a kind of geodesic dome around each image voxel. This [[icosahedron]] provides a mathematical basis for passing a large number of evenly spaced gradient trajectories through the voxel&amp;mdash;each coinciding with one of the apices of the icosahedron. Basically, we are now going to look into the voxel from a large number of different directions (typically 40 or more). We use "''n''-tuple" [[tessellations]] to add more evenly spaced apices to the original icosahedron (20 faces)&amp;mdash;an idea that also had its precedents in paleomagnetism research several decades earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hext GR |title=The estimation of second-order tensors with related tests and designs |journal=Biometrika |volume=50 |pages=353&amp;ndash;373 |year=1963 |doi=10.1093/biomet/50.3-4.353}}&lt;/ref&gt; We just want to know which direction lines turn up the maximum anisotropic diffusion measures. If there is a single tract, there will be just two maxima pointing in opposite directions. If two tracts cross in the voxel, there will be two pairs of maxima, and so on. We can still use tensor math to use the maxima to select groups of gradients to package into several different tensor ellipsoids in the same voxel, or use more complex higher rank tensors analyses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Basser PJ, Pajevic S |title=Spectral decomposition of a 4th-order covariance tensor: applications to diffusion tensor MRI |journal=Signal Processing |volume=87 |pages=220&amp;ndash;236 |year=2007 |doi=10.1016/j.sigpro.2006.02.050 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; or we can do a true "model free" analysis that just picks the maxima and goes on about doing the tractography.

The Q-Ball method of tractography is an implementation in which David Tuch provides a mathematical alternative to the tensor model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tuch DS |title=Q-Ball imaging |journal=Magn. Res. Med. |volume=52 |pages=1358&amp;ndash;1372 |year=2004 |doi=10.1002/mrm.20279 |pmid=15562495 |issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of forcing the diffusion anisotropy data into a group of tensors, the mathematics used deploys both  probability distributions and a classic bit of geometric [[tomography]] and vector math developed nearly 100 years ago&amp;mdash;the [[Funk Radon Transform]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Funk P |title=Uber eine geometrische Anwendung der Abelschen Integralgleichnung |journal=Math. Ann. |volume=77 |pages=129&amp;ndash;135 |year=1919 |doi=10.1007/BF01456824}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Summary===
For DTI, it is generally possible to use [[linear algebra]], matrix mathematics and vector mathematics to process the analysis of the tensor data.

In some cases,  the full set of tensor properties is of interest, but for [[tractography]] it is usually necessary to know only the magnitude and orientation of the primary axis or vector. This primary axis—the one with the greatest length—is the largest eigenvalue and its orientation is encoded in its matched eigenvector. Only one axis is needed because the interest is in the vectorial property of axon direction to accomplish tractography.

'''Diversification rates''' are the rates at which new species form (the [[Speciation]] rate, λ) and living species go extinct (the [[extinction]] rate, μ). Diversification rates can be estimated from [[fossils]], data on the species diversity of [[clades]] and their ages, or [[phylogenetic trees]]. Diversification rates are typically reported on a per-lineage basis (e.g. speciation rate per lineage per unit of time), and refer to the diversification dynamics expected under a [[birth-death process]].

A broad range of studies have demonstrated that diversification rates can vary tremendously both through time and across the tree of life. Current research efforts are focused on predicting diversification rates based on aspects of species or their environment. Diversification rates are also subject to various survivorship biases such as the [[Push of the past|"Push of the past"]]

== Methods for estimating diversification rates ==

=== Fossil time series ===

Diversification rates can be estimated time-series data on fossil occurrences. With perfect data, this would be an easy task; one could just count the number of speciation and extinction events in a given time interval, and then use these data to calculate per-lineage rates of speciation and extinction per unit time. However, the incomplete nature of the fossil record means that our calculations need to include the possibility that some fossil lineages were not sampled, and that we do not have precise estimates for the times of speciation and extinction of the taxa that are sampled. More sophisticated methods account for the probability of sampling any lineage, which might also depend on some properties of the lineage itself (e.g. whether it has any hard body parts that tend to fossilize) as well as the environment in which it lives.

Many estimates of diversification rates for fossil lineages are for higher-level taxonomic groups like genera or families. Such rates are informative about general patterns and trends of diversification through time and across clades but can be difficult to compare directly to rates of speciation and extinction of individual species.

=== Clade age and diversity ===

Diversification rates can be estimated from data on the ages and diversities of monophyletic clades in the tree of life. For example, if a clade is 100 million years old and includes 1000 species, we can estimate the net diversification rate of that clade by using a formula derived from a birth-death model of diversification:

Equations are also available for estimating speciation and extinction rates separately when one has ages and diversities for multiple clades.

=== Phylogenetic trees ===

Diversification rates can be estimated using the information available in phylogenetic trees. To calculate diversification rates, such phylogenetic trees have to include branch lengths. Various methods are available to estimate speciation and extinction rates from phylogenetic trees using both maximum likelihood and Bayesian statistical approaches. One can also use phylogenetic trees to test for changing rates of speciation and/or extinction, both through time and across clades, and to associate rates of evolution with potential explanatory factors.

'''''Egalitarianism as a Revolt Against Nature and Other Essays''''' is a 1974 book by economist [[Murray Rothbard]]. The book represents the author's theorizing on topics impacting human liberty. Rothbard looks beyond conventional left-right thinking and hence contributes to the groundwork for the current intellectual challenge against centralized social and economic management.

The book's title comes from the lead essay, which argues that [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian theory]] always results in a politics of [[Statism|statist]] control because it is founded on revolt against the ontological structure of reality itself. According to Rothbard in this lead essay, statist intellectuals attempt to replace what exists with a Romantic image of an idealized primitive state of nature, an ideal which cannot and should not be achieved, according to Rothbard. The implications of this point are worked out on topics such as market economics, child rights, environmentalism, feminism, foreign policy, redistribution and others.

[[Roy Childs]] writes in the Foreword:
&lt;blockquote&gt;For until Rothbard's work is carefully studied by every advocate of liberty, the value of his contributions to the libertarian system cannot be fully appreciated and, moreover, the unity and true historical context of libertarianism will not even be fully grasped.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''El Greco fallacy''' is typically a perceptive [[fallacy]], where it is assumed that particular perceptual abnormalities will influence interactions with the world of a similar nature. It is named after an erroneous explanation for the vertically distorted painting style of [[El Greco]], which held that the artist must have seen the world as distorted by a peculiar [[astigmatism]], and thus painted this distorted world. This theoretical astigmatism cannot explain El Greco's style though, as he would have seen his canvases distorted in the same way, and painting onto them would have cancelled out any distortion.

It is believed the term originated with [[Irvin Rock]], in his 1966 book, ''The Nature of Perceptual Adaptation''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Firestone|first=Chaz|date=2013|title=On the origin and status of the ‘El Greco fallacy’|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255791390_On_the_origin_and_status_of_the_El_Greco_Fallacy|journal=Perception|volume=42|issue=6|pages=672–674|doi=10.1068/p7488|issn=1468-4233|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Nature of Perceptual Adaptation|last=Rock|first=Irvin|publisher=Basic Books|year=1966|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When explored in experiment — by having subjects wear distorting lenses — it seems likely that El Greco would have completely adapted to seeing a distorted world, and this could not have been an explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anstis|first=Stuart M.|date=2002|title=Was El Greco Astigmatic?|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/article/19805|journal=Leonardo|volume=35|issue=2|page=208|pages=|doi=10.1162/00240940252940612|issn=1530-9282|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In perception research ==
Chaz Firestone and Brian Scholl have alleged that this fallacy has been the cause for mistaken thinking in perception research,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Firestone|first=Chaz|last2=Scholl|first2=Brian J.|date=2014|title=‘Top-down’ effects where none should be found: the El Greco fallacy in perception research|url=http://perception.research.yale.edu/papers/14-Firestone-Scholl-PsychSci-ElGreco.pdf|journal=Psychological Science|volume=25|issue=1|pages=38–46|doi=10.1177/0956797613485092|issn=1467-9280|pmid=24297777|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; including in studies that presumed to show that wearing a heavy backpack makes hills literally appear steeper, or holding rods outstretched horizontally would make doorways look narrower.

In the example of holding rods outstretched, the original experiment had subjects evaluate the width of apertures (intended to simulate doorways), then show this width on a ruler held by experimenters. The width was evaluated as narrower by those holding rods than those who were not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stefanucci|first=Jeanine K.|last2=Geuss|first2=Michael N.|date=2009-01-01|title=Big people, little world: the body influences size perception|journal=Perception|volume=38|issue=12|pages=1782–1795|issn=0301-0066|pmc=3298356|pmid=20192128|doi=10.1068/p6437}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Firestone and Scholl repeated this experiment, substituting rulers for a separate aperture that was adjusted by experimenters to the subjects instruction, the aperture was still evaluated as narrower. This narrowing effect was later implied to be a [[Demand characteristics|demand characteristic]] after another group was told that their holding a rod was an evaluation of balance abilities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Image:Paper shavings attracted by charged cd.jpg|framed|Paper strips attracted by a charged CD]]
[[Image:Cat_demonstrating_static_cling_with_styrofoam_peanuts.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|[[Styrofoam peanut]]s clinging to a cat's fur due to [[static electricity]].  The [[triboelectric effect]] causes an [[electrostatic charge]] to build up on the fur due to the cat's motions. The [[electric field]] of the charge causes polarization of the molecules of the styrofoam due to [[electrostatic induction]], resulting in a slight attraction of the light plastic pieces to the charged fur. This is also the cause of [[static cling]] in clothes.]] 

'''Electrostatics''' is a branch of [[physics]] that studies [[electric charge]]s at rest.

Since [[classical physics]],  it has been known that some materials such as [[amber]] attract lightweight particles after [[Triboelectric effect|rubbing]]. The [[Greek language|Greek]] word for amber, {{lang|grc|ήλεκτρον}}, or ''{{lang|grc-Latn|electron}}'', was the source of the word 'electricity'. Electrostatic phenomena arise from the [[force]]s that electric charges exert on each other. Such forces are described by [[Coulomb's law]].
Even though electrostatically induced forces seem to be rather weak, some electrostatic forces such as the one between an [[electron]] and a [[proton]], that together make up a [[hydrogen]] [[atom]], is about 36 [[Order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] stronger than the [[gravitation]]al force acting between them.

There are many examples of electrostatic phenomena, from those as simple as the attraction of the plastic wrap to one's hand after it is removed from a package to the apparently spontaneous explosion of grain silos, the damage of electronic components during manufacturing, and [[photocopier]] &amp; [[laser printing|laser printer]] operation. Electrostatics involves the buildup of charge on the [[Interface (matter)|surface]] of objects due to contact with other surfaces. Although charge exchange happens whenever any two surfaces contact and separate, the effects of charge exchange are usually only noticed when at least one of the surfaces has a high [[resistance (electricity)|resistance]] to electrical flow.  This is because the charges that transfer are trapped there for a time long enough for their effects to be observed.  These charges then remain on the object until they either bleed off to ground or are quickly neutralized by a [[Electrostatic discharge|discharge]]: e.g., the familiar phenomenon of a static 'shock' is caused by the neutralization of charge built up in the body from contact with insulated surfaces.

==Coulomb's law==
{{Main article|Coulomb's law}}
Coulomb's law states that:

'The magnitude of the electrostatic force of attraction or repulsion between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of the magnitudes of charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.'

The force is along the straight line joining them. If the two charges have the same sign, the electrostatic force between them is repulsive; if they have different signs, the force between them is attractive.

If &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the distance (in [[meters]]) between two charges, then the force (in [[Newton (unit)|newton]]s) between two point charges &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; (in [[coulomb]]s) is:

:&lt;math&gt;F = \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0}\frac{qQ}{r^2}= k_0\frac{qQ}{r^2}\, ,&lt;/math&gt;

where ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[vacuum permittivity]], or permittivity of free space:&lt;ref name="Sadiku"&gt;{{cite book|title=Elements of electromagnetics|year=2009|isbn=9780195387759|page=104|author=Matthew Sadiku}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_0 \approx {10^{-9}\over 36\pi} \;\; \mathrm{C^2\ N^{-1}\ m^{-2}}\approx 8.854\ 187\ 817 \times 10^{-12} \;\; \mathrm{C^2\ N^{-1}\ m^{-2}}. &lt;/math&gt;

The [[International System of Units|SI]] units of ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; are equivalently &amp;ensp;[[Ampere|A]]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;[[second|s]]&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; or [[Coulomb|C]]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;[[Newton (units)|N]]&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;m&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;2&lt;/sup&gt; or [[Farad|F]] m&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;. [[Coulomb's constant]] is:

:&lt;math&gt; k_0 \approx \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\approx 8.987\ 551\ 787 \times 10^9 \;\; \mathrm{N\ m^2\ C}^{-2}. &lt;/math&gt;

The use of ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; instead of k&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in expressing Coulomb's Law is related to the fact that the force is inversely proportional to the [[surface area]] of a sphere with radius equal to the separation between the two charges.

A single [[proton]] has a charge of ''e'', and the [[electron]] has a charge of −''e'', where,

:&lt;math&gt; e \approx 1.602\ 176\ 565 \times 10^{-19}\;\; \mathrm{C}. &lt;/math&gt;

These [[physical constant]]s (ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, k&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, e) are currently defined so that ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and k&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; are exactly defined, and ''e'' is a measured quantity.

==Electric field==
[[Image:Electrostatic induction.svg|thumb|upright=2.0|The [[electrostatic field]] ''(lines with arrows)'' of a nearby positive charge ''&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;(+)&lt;/span&gt;'' causes the mobile charges in conductive objects to separate due to [[electrostatic induction]]. Negative charges ''&lt;span style="color:blue;"&gt;(blue)&lt;/span&gt;'' are attracted and move to the surface of the object facing the external charge.  Positive charges ''&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;(red)&lt;/span&gt;'' are repelled and move to the surface facing away.   These induced surface charges are exactly the right size and shape so their opposing electric field cancels the electric field of the external charge throughout the interior of the metal.  Therefore, the electrostatic field everywhere inside a conductive object is zero, and the [[electrostatic potential]] is constant.]]

The [[electric field]], &lt;math&gt;\vec{E}&lt;/math&gt;, in units of [[Newton (unit)|newtons]] per [[coulomb]] or [[volt]]s per meter, is a [[vector field]] that can be defined everywhere, except at the location of point charges (where it diverges to infinity).&lt;ref name="Purcell"&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is defined as the electrostatic force &lt;math&gt;\vec{F}\,&lt;/math&gt; in newtons on a hypothetical small [[test charge]] at the point due to [[Coulomb's Law]], divided by the magnitude of the charge &lt;math&gt;q\,&lt;/math&gt; in coulombs

:&lt;math&gt;\vec{E} = {\vec{F} \over q}\,&lt;/math&gt;

[[Field line|Electric field lines]] are useful for visualizing the electric field. Field lines begin on positive charge and terminate on negative charge.  They are parallel to the direction of the electric field at each point, and the density of these field lines is a measure of the magnitude of the electric field at any given point.

Consider a collection of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; particles of charge &lt;math&gt;Q_i&lt;/math&gt;, located at points &lt;math&gt;\vec r_i&lt;/math&gt; (called ''source points''), the electric field at &lt;math&gt;\vec r &lt;/math&gt; (called the ''field point'') is:&lt;ref name="Purcell" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;  \vec{E}(\vec r)
=\frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon _0}\sum_{i=1}^N \frac{\widehat\mathcal R_i Q_i}{\left \|\mathcal\vec R_i \right \|^2} ,&lt;/math&gt;

where  &lt;math&gt; \vec\mathcal R_i =  \vec r - \vec r_i ,&lt;/math&gt; is the displacement vector from a ''source point'' 
&lt;math&gt;\vec r_i&lt;/math&gt; to the ''field point'' 
&lt;math&gt;\vec r &lt;/math&gt;, and 
&lt;math&gt; \widehat\mathcal R_i = \vec\mathcal R_i / \left \|\vec\mathcal R_i \right \|&lt;/math&gt; 
is a [[unit vector]] that indicates the direction of the field.  For a single point charge at the origin, the magnitude of this electric field is &lt;math&gt;E =k_eQ/\mathcal R^2,&lt;/math&gt; and points away from that charge is positive. The fact that the force (and hence the field) can be calculated by summing over all the contributions due to individual source particles is an example of the [[superposition principle]].  The electric field produced by a distribution of charges is given by the volume [[charge density]] &lt;math&gt;\rho (\vec r)&lt;/math&gt; and can be obtained by converting this sum into a [[triple integral]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\vec{E}(\vec r)= \frac {1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \iiint \frac {\vec r - \vec r \,'}{\left \| \vec r - \vec r \,' \right \|^3} \rho (\vec r \,')\operatorname{d}^3 r\,'
&lt;/math&gt;

===Gauss' law===
[[Gauss' law]] states that "the total electric flux through any closed surface in free space of any shape drawn in an electric field is proportional to the total [[electric charge]] enclosed by the surface." Mathematically, Gauss's law takes the form of an integral equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\oint_S\vec{E} \cdot\mathrm{d}\vec{A}  = \frac{1}{\varepsilon_0}\,Q_{enclosed}=\int_V{\rho\over\varepsilon_0}\cdot\operatorname{d}^3 r,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{d}^3 r =\mathrm{d}x \ \mathrm{d}y \ \mathrm{d}z &lt;/math&gt; is a volume element. If the charge is distributed over a surface or along a line, replace &lt;math&gt; \rho\mathrm{d}^3r &lt;/math&gt; by  &lt;math&gt; \sigma\mathrm{d}A &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; \lambda\mathrm{d}\ell &lt;/math&gt;. The [[Divergence Theorem]] allows Gauss's Law to be written in differential form:

:&lt;math&gt;\vec{\nabla}\cdot\vec{E} = {\rho\over\varepsilon_0}.&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\vec{\nabla} \cdot&lt;/math&gt; is the [[divergence|divergence operator]].

===Poisson and Laplace equations===

The definition of electrostatic potential, combined with the differential form of Gauss's law (above), provides a relationship between the potential Φ and the charge density ρ:

:&lt;math&gt;{\nabla}^2 \phi = - {\rho\over\varepsilon_0}.&lt;/math&gt;

This relationship is a form of [[Poisson's equation]]. In the absence of unpaired electric charge, the equation becomes [[Laplace's equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;{\nabla}^2 \phi = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

==Electrostatic approximation==
The validity of the electrostatic approximation rests on the assumption that the electric field is [[irrotational]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\vec{\nabla}\times\vec{E} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

From [[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday's law]], this assumption implies the absence or near-absence of time-varying magnetic fields:

:&lt;math&gt;{\partial\vec{B}\over\partial t} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, electrostatics does not require the absence of magnetic fields or electric currents. Rather, if magnetic fields or electric currents ''do'' exist, they must not change with time, or in the worst-case, they must change with time only ''very slowly''. In some problems, both electrostatics and [[magnetostatics]] may be required for accurate predictions, but the coupling between the two can still be ignored. Electrostatics and magnetostatics can both be seen as Galilean limits for electromagnetism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heras|first1=J. A.|title=The Galilean limits of Maxwell's equations|journal=[[American Journal of Physics]]|date=2010|volume=78|issue=10|pages=1048|doi=10.1119/1.3442798|arxiv = 1012.1068 |bibcode = 2010AmJPh..78.1048H }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify source|date=May 2016}}&lt;!--The original was &lt;ref name="Levy Leblond"&gt;{{cite journal| title = Galinean electromagnetism

===Electrostatic potential===

Because the electric field is [[irrotational]], it is possible to express the electric field as the [[gradient]] of a scalar function,&lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, called the [[electrostatic potential]] (also known as the [[voltage]]). An electric field, &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, points from regions of high electric potential to regions of low electric potential, expressed mathematically as

:&lt;math&gt;\vec{E} = -\vec{\nabla}\phi.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Vector calculus|gradient theorem]] can be used to establish that the electrostatic potential is the amount of [[work (physics)|work]] per unit charge required to move a charge from point &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; to point &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; with the following [[line integral]]:

:&lt;math&gt; -\int_a^b{\vec{E}\cdot \mathrm{d}\vec \ell} = \phi (\vec b) -\phi(\vec a).&lt;/math&gt;

From these equations, we see that the electric potential is constant in any region for which the electric field vanishes (such as occurs inside a conducting object).

===Electrostatic energy===
{{Main article|Electric potential energy|Energy density}}

A single [[test particle]]'s potential energy, &lt;math&gt;  U_\mathrm{E}^{\text{single}}&lt;/math&gt;, can be calculated from a [[line integral]] of the work, &lt;math&gt;q_n\vec E\cdot\mathrm d\vec\ell &lt;/math&gt;.  We integrate from a point at infinity, and assume a collection of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; particles of charge &lt;math&gt;Q_n&lt;/math&gt;, are already situated at the points &lt;math&gt;\vec r_i&lt;/math&gt;.  This potential energy (in [[Joule]]s) is:

:&lt;math&gt;  U_\mathrm{E}^{\text{single}}=q\phi(\vec r)=\frac{q }{4\pi \varepsilon_0}\sum_{i=1}^N \frac{Q_i}{\left \|\mathcal{\vec R_i} \right \|} &lt;/math&gt;

where  &lt;math&gt; \vec\mathcal {R_i} = \vec r - \vec r_i&lt;/math&gt; is the distance of each charge &lt;math&gt;Q_i&lt;/math&gt; from the [[test charge]] &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;, which situated at the point &lt;math&gt;\vec r &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; \phi(\vec r)&lt;/math&gt;  is the electric potential that would be at &lt;math&gt;\vec r &lt;/math&gt; if the [[test charge]] were not present.  If only two charges are present, the potential energy is &lt;math&gt;k_eQ_1Q_2/r&lt;/math&gt;.  The total [[electric potential energy]] due a collection of ''N'' charges is calculating by assembling these particles [[Electric Potential Energy|one at a time]]:

:&lt;math&gt;U_\mathrm{E}^{\text{total}} = \frac{1 }{4\pi \varepsilon _0}\sum_{j=1}^N Q_j \sum_{i=1}^{j-1} \frac{Q_i}{r_{ij}}= \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^N Q_i\phi_i ,&lt;/math&gt;

where the following sum from, ''j = 1'' to ''N'', excludes ''i = j'':

:&lt;math&gt;\phi_i = \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon _0}\sum_{j=1 (j\ne i)}^N \frac{Q_j}{r_{ij}}. &lt;/math&gt;

This electric potential, &lt;math&gt;\phi_i&lt;/math&gt; is what would be measured at &lt;math&gt;\vec r_i&lt;/math&gt; if the charge &lt;math&gt;Q_i&lt;/math&gt; were missing.  This formula obviously excludes the (infinite) energy that would be required to assemble each point charge from a disperse cloud of charge.  The sum over charges can be converted into an integral over charge density using the prescription &lt;math&gt;\sum (\cdots) \rightarrow \int(\cdots)\rho\mathrm d^3r&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;U_\mathrm{E}^{\text{total}} = \frac{1}{2} \int\rho(\vec{r})\phi(\vec{r}) \operatorname{d}^3 r = \frac{\varepsilon_0 }{2} \int  \left|{\mathbf{E}}\right|^2 \operatorname{d}^3 r&lt;/math&gt;,

This second expression for [[electrostatic energy]] uses the fact that the electric field is the negative [[gradient]] of the electric potential, as well as [[vector calculus identities]] in a way that resembles [[integration by parts]].  These two integrals for electric field energy seem to indicate two mutually exclusive formulas for electrostatic energy density, namely &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}\rho\phi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{\varepsilon_0 }{2}E^2&lt;/math&gt;; they yield equal values for the total electrostatic energy only if both are integrated over all space.

===Electrostatic pressure===

On a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]], a surface charge will experience a force in the presence of an [[electric field]]. This force is the average of the discontinuous electric field at the surface charge. This average in terms of the field just outside the surface amounts to:

:&lt;math&gt; P = \frac{ \varepsilon_0 }{2} E^2 &lt;/math&gt;,

This pressure tends to draw the conductor into the field, regardless of the sign of the surface charge.

==Triboelectric series==
{{Main article|Triboelectric effect}}

The [[triboelectric effect]] is a type of contact electrification in which certain materials become electrically charged when they are brought into contact with a different material and then separated.  One of the materials acquires a positive charge, and the other acquires an equal negative charge.  The polarity and strength of the charges produced differ according to the materials, surface roughness, temperature, strain, and other properties.  Amber, for example, can acquire an electric charge by friction with a material like wool. This property, first recorded by [[Thales of Miletus]], was the first electrical phenomenon investigated by humans. Other examples of materials that can acquire a significant charge when rubbed together include glass rubbed with silk, and hard rubber rubbed with fur.

==Electrostatic generators==
{{Main article|Electrostatic generator}}
The presence of [[surface charge]] imbalance means that the objects will exhibit attractive or repulsive forces. This surface charge imbalance, which yields static electricity, can be generated by touching two differing surfaces together and then separating them due to the phenomena of [[contact electrification]] and the [[triboelectric effect]]. Rubbing two nonconductive objects generates a great amount of static electricity. This is not just the result of friction; two nonconductive surfaces can become charged by just being placed one on top of the other. Since most surfaces have a rough texture, it takes longer to achieve charging through contact than through rubbing. Rubbing objects together increases amount of adhesive contact between the two surfaces. Usually [[Insulator (electricity)|insulators]], e.g., substances that do not conduct electricity, are good at both generating, and holding, a surface charge.  Some examples of these substances are [[rubber]], [[plastic]], [[glass]], and [[pith]]. [[conductor (material)|Conductive]] objects only rarely generate charge imbalance except, for example, when a metal surface is impacted by solid or liquid nonconductors. The charge that is transferred during contact electrification is stored on the surface of each object. [[electrostatic generator|Static electric generators]], devices which produce very high voltage at very low current and used for classroom physics demonstrations, rely on this effect.

Note that the presence of [[electric current]] does not detract from the electrostatic forces nor from the sparking, from the [[corona discharge]], or other phenomena. Both phenomena can exist simultaneously in the same system.

==Charge neutralization==
Natural electrostatic phenomena are most familiar as an occasional annoyance in seasons of low humidity, but can be destructive and harmful in some situations (e.g. electronics manufacturing). When working in direct contact with integrated circuit electronics (especially delicate [[MOSFET]]s), or in the presence of flammable gas, care must be taken to avoid accumulating and suddenly discharging a static charge (see [[electrostatic discharge]]).

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a redistribution of charges in an object caused by the electric field of a nearby charge.  For example, if a positively charged object is brought near an uncharged metal object, the mobile negatively-charged [[electron]]s in the metal will be attracted the external charge, and move to the side of the metal facing it, creating a negative charge on the surface.  When the electrons move out of an area they leave a positive charge due to the metal atoms' [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]], so the side of the metal object facing away from the charge acquires a positive charge. These ''induced charges'' disappear when the external charge is removed.  Induction is also responsible for the attraction of light objects, such as balloons, paper scraps and styrofoam packing peanuts to static charges.  The surface charges induced in conductive objects exactly cancel external electric fields inside the conductor, so there is no electric field inside a metal object.  This is the basis for the electric field shielding action of a [[Faraday cage]].  Since the electric field is the [[gradient (calculus)|gradient]] of the voltage, electrostatic induction is also responsible for making the [[electric potential]] ([[voltage]]) constant throughout a conductive object.

=='Static' electricity==
{{Main article|Static electricity}}
[[Image:Lightning over Oradea Romania 3.jpg|thumbnail|[[Lightning]] over [[Oradea]] in [[Romania]]]]
Before the year 1832, when [[Michael Faraday]] published the results of his experiment on the identity of electricities, physicists thought "static electricity" was somehow different from other electrical charges. Michael Faraday proved that the electricity induced from the magnet, voltaic electricity produced by a battery, and static electricity are all the same.

Static electricity is usually caused when certain materials are rubbed against each other, like wool on plastic or the soles of shoes on carpet. The process causes electrons to be pulled from the surface of one material and relocated on the surface of the other material.

A static shock occurs when the surface of the second material, negatively charged with electrons, touches a positively charged conductor, or vice versa.

Static electricity is commonly used in [[xerography]], [[air filter]]s, and some automotive paints.
Static electricity is a buildup of electric charges on two objects that have become separated from each other.
Small electrical components can easily be damaged by static electricity. Component manufacturers use a number of [[antistatic devices]] to avoid this.

=== Static electricity and chemical industry ===
When different materials are brought together and then separated, an accumulation of electric charge can occur which leaves one material positively charged while the other becomes negatively charged. The mild shock that you receive when touching a grounded object after walking on carpet is an example of excess electrical charge accumulating in your body from frictional charging between your shoes and the carpet. The resulting charge build-up upon your body can generate a strong electrical discharge. Although experimenting with static electricity may be fun, similar sparks create severe hazards in those industries dealing with flammable substances, where a small electrical spark may ignite explosive mixtures with devastating consequences.

A similar charging mechanism can occur within low conductivity fluids flowing through pipelines—a process called flow electrification. Fluids which have low electrical conductivity (below 50 picosiemens per meter), are called accumulators. Fluids having conductivities above 50 pS/m are called non-accumulators. In non-accumulators, charges recombine as fast as they are separated and hence electrostatic charge generation is not significant. In the [[petrochemical industry]], 50 pS/m is the recommended minimum value of electrical conductivity for adequate removal of charge from a fluid.

An important concept for insulating fluids is the static relaxation time. This is similar to the time constant (tau) within an [[RC circuit]]. For insulating materials, it is the ratio of the static [[dielectric constant]] divided by the electrical conductivity of the material. For hydrocarbon fluids, this is sometimes approximated by dividing the number 18 by the electrical conductivity of the fluid. Thus a fluid that has an electrical conductivity of 1 pS/cm (100 pS/m) will have an estimated relaxation time of about 18 seconds. The excess charge within a fluid will be almost completely dissipated after 4 to 5 times the relaxation time, or 90 seconds for the fluid in the above example.

Charge generation increases at higher fluid velocities and larger pipe diameters, becoming quite significant in pipes {{convert|8|in|mm}} or larger. Static charge generation in these systems is best controlled by limiting fluid velocity. The British standard BS PD CLC/TR 50404:2003 (formerly BS-5958-Part 2) Code of Practice for Control of Undesirable Static Electricity prescribes velocity limits. Because of its large impact on dielectric constant, the recommended velocity for hydrocarbon fluids containing water should be limited to 1&amp;nbsp;m/s.

Bonding and earthing are the usual ways by which charge buildup can be prevented. For fluids with electrical conductivity below 10 pS/m, bonding and earthing are not adequate for charge dissipation, and anti-static additives may be required.

==Electrostatic induction in commercial applications==
Electrostatic induction was used in the past to build high-voltage generators known as [[Influence machine]]s.
The main component that emerged in these times is the [[capacitor]]. 
Electrostatic induction is also used for electro-mechanic precipitation or projection.In such technologies, charged particles of small sizes are collected or deposited intentionally on surfaces. Applications range from [[Electrostatic precipitator]] to [[Spray painting]] or [[Inkjet printing]].
Recently a new [[Wireless power]] Transfer Technology has been based on electrostatic induction between oscillating distant dipoles.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29638">The '''endurance running hypothesis''' is the [[hypothesis]] that the evolution of certain human characteristics can be explained as adaptations to long distance running.&lt;ref name="Carrier" /&gt;&lt;ref name="number8"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bramble|first=Dennis|author2=Lieberman, Daniel|title=Endurance running and the evolution of Homo|journal=Nature|date=November 2004|volume=432|doi=10.1038/nature03052|pmid=15549097|pages=345–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis suggests that endurance running played an important role for early [[hominins]] in obtaining food. Researchers have proposed that endurance running began as an adaptation for scavenging and later for [[persistence hunting]].

==Anatomical and physiological adaptations==

===Running vs. walking===
Much research has been geared towards the mechanics of how [[bipedal]] walking has evolved in the genus ''[[Homo]]''. However, little research has been conducted to examine how the specific adaptations for running emerged, and how they influenced human evolution.

The bit of research that has focused on human running provides much evidence for bodily function and structures that improve running only, and are not used in walking. This suggests that running was an adaptation, not that it came about as a byproduct of walking.

Running and walking incorporated different biomechanisms. Walking requires an "inverted pendulum" where the body's center of mass is shifted over the extended leg, to exchange potential and kinetic energy with each step.&lt;ref name="number8"/&gt; Running involves a "mass spring" mechanism to exchange potential and kinetic energy, with the use of tendons and ligaments. Tendons and ligaments are elastic tissues that store energy. They are stretched and then release energy as they recoil. This mass spring mechanism becomes less energetically costly at faster speeds and is therefore more efficient than the inverted pendulum of walking mechanics when traveling at greater speeds.&lt;ref name=number8 /&gt; Tendons and ligaments, however, do not provide these benefits in walking.

Although the mass spring mechanism can be more energetically favorable at higher speeds, it also results in an increase in ground reaction forces&lt;ref name=number8 /&gt; and is less stable because there is more movement and pitching of the limbs and core of the body. Ground forces and body pitching movement is less of an issue in the walking gait, where the position of the body's center of mass varies less, making walking an inherently more stable gait. In response to the destabilization of the running gait, the human body appears to have evolved adaptations to increase stabilization, as well as for the mass-spring mechanism in general. These adaptations, described below, are all evidence for selection for endurance running.

===Skeletal evidence===
Many researchers compare the skeletal structures of early hominins such as ''[[Australopithecus]]'' to those of ''Homo'' in order to identify structural differences that may be significant to endurance running.

'''[[Nuchal ligament]]:''' Because the head is decoupled from the shoulders, early ''Homo'' needed a way to stabilize the head. The nuchal ligament is an important evolved feature in head stabilization. It starts at the midline of the [[occiput]] and connects to the upper [[trapezius]]. This ligament is also important in terms of archaeological findings, because it leaves a small indentation and ridge in the skull, allowing researchers to see if various species had a nuchal ligament. The ability to see traces of ligaments in archaeological findings is rare because they degrade quickly and often leave no trace. In the case of the nuchal ligament, a trace of its existence is left with the presence of the skull ridge. Because neither ''[[Australopithecus]]'' nor ''[[Pan (genus)|Pan]]'' had the skull ridge, it has been concluded that this feature is unique to ''Homo''. &lt;ref name="Lieberman"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lieberman|first=Daniel|author2=Bramble, Dennis |author3=Raichlen, David |author4= Shea, John |title=Brains, Brawn, and the Evolution of Human Endurance Running Capabilities|journal=Contributions from the Third Stony Brook Human Evolution Symposium and Workshop|date=October 2006|pages=77–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because the nuchal ligament is only activated while running, the amount of running can be inferred from the muscle markings. In the case of Homo Erectus and Neanderthals, very strong nuchal ligament markings are present, but are less marked in modern humans, indicating a decrease in running behavior &lt;ref name="Lieberman"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lieberman|first=Daniel|author2=Bramble, Dennis |author3=Raichlen, David |author4= Shea, John |title=Brains, Brawn, and the Evolution of Human Endurance Running Capabilities|journal=Contributions from the Third Stony Brook Human Evolution Symposium and Workshop|date=October 2006|pages=77–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Nuchal Ligament of Homo Sapien.jpg| thumb|Nuchal ligament of ''Homo sapiens'']]

'''Shoulder and head stabilization:''' The human skeleton is different from early hominins as there is less of a connection between the [[pectoral girdle]] parts of the shoulders and upper back and head, which would be advantageous for climbing but would hinder the movements of the upper body needed to counter leg movement and therefore stabilize the body and head when running. This stabilization is unnecessary in walking.

'''Limb length and mass:''' ''Homo'' has longer legs relative to body mass, which helps to decrease the energetic costs of running, as time in contact with the ground increases.&lt;ref name=number8 /&gt; There is also a decrease in mass of distal parts of limbs of humans, which is known to decrease metabolic costs in endurance running, but has little effect on walking.&lt;ref name=number8 /&gt; Additionally, the mass of the upper body limbs in ''Homo'' has decreased considerably, relative to total body mass, which is important to reduce the effort of stabilizing the arms in running.

'''Joint surface:''' Humans have evolved to absorb great shock and force on the skeletal structure while running. The impact force on the body can reach up to 3-4 times body weight in endurance running, putting the skeletal structure under great stress. To reduce this stress humans have increased joint surfaces relative to body mass to spread force over larger surface areas, particularly in the lower body.&lt;ref name=number8 /&gt; This adaptation, which allows humans to absorb great shock and force applied to the skeleton, is not seen in australopithecine skeletal structures.

'''Plantar arch:''' The [[plantar arch]] in the human foot has an elastic spring function that generates energy for running but not walking.&lt;ref name=number8 /&gt; Fossils of the australopithecine foot show only partial arch, suggesting less of a spring capacity. For the plantar arch spring mechanism to function fully, there must also be restricted rotation in the hind and front parts of the foot. This restriction comes from projected toe bone and compacted mid-foot joint structures in humans, which does not become present until ''Homo habilis''.&lt;ref name=number8 /&gt;

'''Calcaneal tuber and Achilles tendon:''' Studies have explored the calcaneal tuber, the posterior half of the calcaneus bone, as a correlate for [[Achilles tendon]] length and have found correlation between calcaneal tuber length and Achilles tendon length. Because shorter calcaneal tuber length leads to greater Achilles stretch, more kinetic energy is converted to elastic energy, translating into better overall [[running economy]]. Comparisons between Neanderthals and modern humans reveal that this adaptation was absent in Neanderthals, leading researchers to conclude that endurance running capabilities may have been enhanced in anatomically modern humans.&lt;ref name="Raichlen"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Raichlen|first=D.A.|author2=Armstrong, H |author3=Lieberman, D.E. |title=Calcaneus length determines running economy: Implications for endurance running performance in modern humans and Neandertals.|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|date=26 January 2011|volume=60|pages=299–308|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmet/21269660|doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2010.11.002|pmid=21269660}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Calcaneus anatomy.jpg|Calcaneus 
&lt;/gallery&gt;

'''Shorter toes:''' Human toes are straight and extremely short in relation to body size compared to other animals. In running, the toes support 50 to 75% of body mass in humans. [[Impulse (physics)|Impulse]] and mechanical work increase in humans as toe length increases, showing that it is energetically favorable to have shorter toes. The costs of shorter toes are decreased gripping capabilities and power output. However, the efficiency benefits seem to outweigh these costs, as the toes of ''A. afarensis'' remains were shorter than great apes, but 40% longer than modern humans, meaning that there is a trend toward shorter toes as the primate species moves away from tree-dwelling. This 40% increase in toe length would theoretically induce a flexor impulse 2.5 times that of modern humans, which would require twice as much mechanical work to stabilize.&lt;ref name="Rolian"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rolian|first=Campbell|author2=Lieberman, Daniel |author3=Hamill, Joseph |author4=Scott, John |author5= Werbel, William |title=Walking, running and the evolution of short toes in humans|journal=The Journal of Experimental Biology|date=November 2008|pages=212, 713–721}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stabilization===
'''Semicircular canal:''' The [[semicircular canal]], a series of three interconnected tubes within each ear, is important for sensing angular rotations of the head and thus plays a crucial role in maintaining balance and sensing and coordinating movement. Comparative studies have shown that animals with larger semicircular canals are able to sense a greater range of head movements and therefore have greater speed and agility. Evolutionarily, greatly reduced semicircular canal diameters are evident in Neanderthals but expanded in modern humans, suggesting that this adaptation was selected for in response to increased endurance running.&lt;ref name=Raichlen /&gt;

'''Vestibulo-ocular reflexes (VORs):''' [[Vestibulo-ocular reflex|VORs]] are enabled by muscles in the eye, which sense angular accelerations of the head and adjust eye movements to stabilize these images. This was an important adaptation for running because it allowed ''Homo'' to see more clearly during the rough pitching motion that occurs during running.&lt;ref name=Lieberman /&gt;

'''Gluteals:''' The [[gluteus maximus]] in ''Homo erectus'' is significantly larger than that of ''Australopithecus''. It is suited to stabilize the trunk while running, but gluteals of that size and strength are not necessary for walking.

'''Iliac spine:''' ''Homo'' has expanded areas on the sacrum and posterior iliac spine for greater muscle attachment. These areas are used to stabilize the trunk and reduce the body's forward pitch caused by running strides.

===Increased efficiency===
==== Thermoregulation ====
{{further|Thermoregulation}}
In addition to advances in skeletal structure and stabilization, adaptations that led to increased efficiency in dissipation of heat were instrumental in the evolution of endurance running in ''Homo''.&lt;ref name="Carrier" /&gt; The duration for which an animal can run is determined by its capacity to release more heat than is produced to avoid lethal temperatures.

The majority of mammals, including humans, rely on evaporative cooling to maintain body temperature. Most medium-to-large mammals rely on panting, while humans rely on [[perspiration|sweating]], to dissipate heat. Advantages to panting include cooler skin surface, little salt loss, and heat loss by forced convection instead of reliance on wind or other means of convection. On the other hand, sweating is advantageous in that evaporation occurs over a much larger surface area (the skin), and it is independent of respiration, thus is a much more flexible mode of cooling during intense activity such as running. Because human sweat glands are under a higher level of neuronal control than those of other species, they allow for the excretion of more sweat per unit surface area than any other species. Heat dissipation of later hominins was also enhanced by the reduction in body hair.&lt;ref name="Carrier"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carrier|first=D.R.|title=The Energetic Paradox of Human Running and Hominid Evolution|journal=Current Anthropology|date=Aug–Oct 1984|volume=25|issue=4|pages=483–495|jstor=2742907|doi=10.1086/203165|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; By ridding themselves of an insulating fur coat, running humans are better able to dissipate the heat generated by exercise.

In addition to improved thermoregulation, hominins have evolved an enhanced method of respiration consistent with the demands of running. Due to their orientation, respiration in quadrupedal mammals is affected by skeletal and muscular stresses generated through the motion of running. The bones and muscles of the chest cavity are not only responsible for shock absorption, but are also subjected to continuous compression and expansion during the running cycle. Because of this movement, quadrupeds are restricted to one breath per locomotor cycle, and thus must coordinate their running gait and respiration rate.&lt;ref name=Carrier /&gt; This tight coordination then translates into another restriction: a specific running speed that is most energetically favorable. The upright orientation of bipedal hominins, however, frees them from this respiration-gait restriction. Because their chest cavities are not directly compressed or involved in the motion of running, hominins are able to vary their breathing patterns with gait.&lt;ref name=Carrier /&gt; This flexibility in respiration rate and running gait contributes to hominins having a broader range of energetically favorable running speeds.

==== Storage and utilization of energy ====
During periods of prolonged exercise, animals are dependent on a combination of two sources of fuel: [[glycogen]] stored in the muscles and liver, and fat. Because glycogen is more easily oxidized than fat, it is depleted first. However, over longer periods of time, energy demands require that fat stores be utilized as fuel. This is true for all mammals, but hominins, and later modern humans, have an advantage of being able to alter their diet to meet these prolonged energy demands.

In addition to flexibility in the utilization of energy, hominins have evolved larger [[thyroid]] and [[adrenal]] glands which enable them to utilize the energy in carbohydrates and fatty acids more readily and efficiently. These organs are responsible for releasing hormones including epinephrine, norepinephrine, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), glucagon, and thyroxine. Larger glands allows for greater production of these key hormones and ultimately, maximized utilization of stored fuel.&lt;ref name=Carrier /&gt;

Taken together, the flexibility in diet and the enhanced usage of fuel heightens the previously mentioned finding that, unlike quadrupeds, hominins do not have a single energetically optimal running speed. For quadrupeds, increasing running speed means increasing the demand for oxygen and fuel. Due to skeletal structure and bipedalism, hominins are free to run energetically over a broader range of speeds and gaits, while maintaining a constant energy consumption rate of approximately 4.1&amp;nbsp;MJ per 15&amp;nbsp;km. Thus their utilization of energy is greatly enhanced.&lt;ref name=Carrier /&gt;

==Endurance running and scavenging==
All of the aforementioned adaptations enabled Homo to scavenge for food more effectively. Endurance running could have been used as a means of gaining access to distant carcasses or food stores faster than other scavengers and/or carnivores. Scavenging may have taken one or both of two forms: Opportunistic scavenging and strategic scavenging.

Early Homo almost certainly scavenged opportunistically. Scavenging is considered opportunistic when one "come[s] across carcasses in the course of [their] daily foraging activities".&lt;ref name=Lieberman /&gt;

Strategic scavenging involves a planned search for carcasses. This style of scavenging would have benefitted from endurance running much more than opportunistic scavenging. Strategic scavenging would have involved the use of long range cues, such as birds circling overhead. Endurance running would have been advantageous in this setting because it allowed hominins to reach the carcass more quickly. Selection pressures would have been very high for strategic scavenging, because hominins were diurnal, while their major competitors (hyenas, lions, etc.) were not. Thus, they would have had to make sure to capitalize on daytime carcasses. Selection pressure also came from the weakness of Homo. Because they were very weak, they were unlikely to drive off any large competition at the carcass. This fact led to an even higher need for a way to reach the carcass before these competitors.&lt;ref name=Lieberman /&gt;

==Endurance running and persistence hunting==
[[Persistence hunting]] is "a form of pursuit hunting in which [the hunter uses] endurance running during the midday heat to drive [prey] into [[hyperthermia]] and exhaustion so they can easily be killed".&lt;ref name="Carrier" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lieberman /&gt; Many question persistence hunting's plausibility when bow and arrow and other technologies were so much more efficient. However, in the Early Stone Age (ESA), spears were only sharpened wood, and hominins had not begun using tools. The lack of spearheads or bows meant they could only hunt from very close range—between 6 and 10 meters.&lt;ref name="Churchill"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Churchill|first=S.E.|title=Weapon technology, prey size selection and hunting methods in modern hunter gatherers: implications for hunting in the [[Paleolithic]] and [[Mesolithic]]|journal=Archeological Papers of the American Anthropological Association|year=1993|issue=4|pages=11–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hominins thus must have developed a way to stab prey from close range without causing serious bodily harm to themselves. Persistence hunting makes killing an animal easier by first bringing it to exhaustion, so that it can no longer retaliate violently.

Persistence hunters work by hunting in the middle of the day, when it is hottest. Hunters choose a single target prey and chase it at a speed between its trot and gallop, which is extremely inefficient for the animal. The hunter then continues pursuing over a period of hours, during which he may lose sight of the animal. In this case, the hunter must use tracks and an understanding of the animal to continue the chase. The prey eventually overheats and becomes unable to continue fleeing. Homo, which does not overheat as quickly because of its superior thermoregulation capabilities, is then able to stab the prey while it is incapacitated and cannot attack.

===Tracking===
Due to the complexity of following a fleeing animal, tracking methods must have been a prerequisite for the use of endurance running in persistence hunting. Scientists posit that early tracking methods were developed in open, sparsely vegetated terrain such as the [[Kalahari Desert]] in southern Africa. This "systemic tracking" involves simply following the footprints of animals and was most likely used for tracking grassland species on soft terrain. Skeletal remains suggest that during the Middle Stone Age, hominins used systemic tracking to scavenge for medium-sized animals in vegetation cover, but for hunting antelope in more open grasslands. From the Middle Stone Age into the Later Stone Age, tracking methods developed into what is termed "speculative tracking". When tracks could not easily be found and followed, ''Homo'' predicted where tracks were most likely to be found and interpreted other signs to locate prey.&lt;ref name="Liebenberg"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liebenberg|first=Louis|title=Persistence Hunting by Modern Hunter-Gatherers|journal=Current Anthropology|date=December 2006|volume=47|issue=6|pages=1017–1026|jstor=10.1086/508695|doi=10.1086/508695}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This advanced method of tracking allowed for the exploitation of prey in a variety of terrains, making endurance running for persistence hunting more plausible.

===Examples of persistence hunters===
Although exact dates and methods of persistence hunting are difficult to study, several recent accounts of persistence hunting have been recorded. Tribes in the Kalahari Desert in Botswana have been known to employ endurance running to scavenge and hunt prey. In the open country, the !Xo and /Gwi tribes run down slow-moving animals such as aardvark and porcupines, while during the hotter part of the day, they target animals such as [[Common eland|eland]], [[kudu]], [[gemsbok]], [[hartebeest]], [[duiker]], [[steenbok]], [[cheetah]], [[caracal]], and [[African wildcat]]s. In addition to these existing African tribes, it has been suggested that the [[Tarahumara people]] in Mexico and the [[Southern Paiute|Paiute people]] and [[Navajo people|Navajo]] in the American Southwest, used persistence hunting to capture prey including deer and pronghorn. The [[Aboriginal Australians|Aborigines]] in Australia are known to have hunted kangaroo in similar ways.&lt;ref name=Liebenberg /&gt;  Due to the increased availability of weapons, nutrition, tracking devices, and motor vehicles, one may argue that persistence hunting is no longer an effective method of hunting animals for food. However, there are examples of the practice occurring in modern times: the !Xo and /Gwi in the central Kalahari, still practice persistence hunting and have developed advanced methods of doing so. Similarly, the Russian [[Lykov family]] that lived in isolation for 40 years also used persistence hunting due to a lack of weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/For-40-Years-This-Russian-Family-Was-Cut-Off-From-Human-Contact-Unaware-of-World-War-II-188843001.html |title=For 40 Years, This Russian Family Was Cut Off From All Human Contact, Unaware of World War II &amp;#124; History &amp;#124; Smithsonian |publisher=Smithsonianmag.com |date=2013-01-28 |accessdate=2016-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Seasonal differences===
In particular, these two tribes maximize the efficiency of persistence hunting by targeting specific species during different seasons. In the rainy season, prime targets include steenbok, duiker, and gemsbok, as wet sand opens their hooves and stiffens their joints. Hunting in the early rainy season is particularly advantageous because dry leaves form "rocks" in the animals' stomachs, resulting in diarrhea. Stiff joints and suboptimal digestion make the prey weaker and more available targets. In contrast, in the dry season, hunters run down kudu, eland, and red hartebeest because these species tire more easily in the loose sand. Hunters say that the best time to practice persistence hunting is near the end of the dry season when animals are poorly nourished and therefore more easily run to exhaustion.&lt;ref name=Liebenberg /&gt;  By targeting the most vulnerable prey during each season, the hunters maximize the advantages of endurance running.

===Conditions/parameters===
# Persistence hunting must be performed during the day when it is hot, so that the animal will overheat.
# ''Homo'' must have been able to track the animal, as they would have lost sight of it during the chase.
# Such a long hunt requires high amounts of dietary sources of water, salt, and [[glycogen]].
# Although the success rate of recorded persistence hunts is very high (approximately 50%&lt;ref name=Lieberman /&gt;), unsuccessful hunts are very costly. Therefore, there would have had to be a social system in which individuals share food, so unsuccessful hunters could borrow food from others when necessary.

==In culture and folklore==
In the oral traditions of the [[Hadza people|Hadza]], an isolated [[Indigenous peoples of Africa|aboriginal]] people of [[hunter-gatherers]] living in [[Tanzania]], the ''Tlaatlanebe'' in their folk history's second [[Epoch (reference date)|epoch]] practiced this.

In the first epoch, the world was inhabited by large hairy humanoids called ''Akakaanebe'' ("ancestors"), who did not yet possess tools or fire. They simply "stared" at game until it fell dead, referring to either [[scavenging]] or early [[persistence hunting]] without weapons, or a combination of the two. They did not build houses but slept under trees.

The Tlaatlanebe of the second epoch, however, were large but without hair and lived in caves. As animals had grown more wary of humans due to earlier hunting, they now had to be chased and hunted with dogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ndagala|first=D. K.|last2=Zengu|first2=N.|title=Who needs the past?: indigenous values and archaeology|year=1994|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-415-09558-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7TPIDL9RdsoC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=From+the+raw+to+the+cooked:+Hadzabe+perceptions+of+their+past#v=onepage&amp;q=From%20the%20raw%20to%20the%20cooked%3A%20Hadzabe%20perceptions%20of%20their%20past&amp;f=false|editor=Robert Layton|chapter=From the raw to the cooked: Hadzabe perceptions of their past|pages=51–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
While there is evidence supporting selection on human morphology to improve endurance running ability, there is some dispute over whether the ecological benefits of scavenging and persistence hunting foraging behaviors were the driving force behind this development.

The majority of the arguments opposing persistence hunting and scavenging behaviors are linked to the fact that the paleohabitat and [[paleoecology]] of early ''Homo'' were not conducive to these behaviors. It is thought that the earliest members of ''Homo'' lived in African savanna-woodlands.&lt;ref name=number9 /&gt; This environment consisted of open grassland, as well as parts with dense vegetation—an intermediate between forest and open savannas. The presence of such tree covering would reduce visibility and so require tracking skills. This causes problems for the hypothesis of persistence hunting and running to aid scavenging.

===Against persistence hunting===

[[Ungulates]] are known from archaeological evidence to have been the main prey of the early ''Homo'', and given their great speed, they would have easily been able to outrun early hominins. Ungulate speed, coupled with the variable visibility of the savanna-woodland, meant that hunting by endurance running required the ability to track prey. Pickering and Bunn argue that tracking is part of a sophisticated cognitive skill set that early hominins would not have had, and that even if they were following a trail of blood left by an injured ungulate—which may have been in their cognitive capacity—the ability to craft penetrating projectile technology was absent in early hominins.&lt;ref name="number9"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pickering|first=Travis Rayne|author2=Bunn, Henry|title=The endurance running hypothesis and hunting and scavenging in savanna-woodlands|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|date=October 2007|volume=53|issue=4|doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2007.01.012|pages=434–438|pmid=17720224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that modern hunters in Africa do not use persistence hunting as a foraging method, and most often give up a chase where the trail they were following ends in vegetation.&lt;ref name=number9 /&gt; The rare groups of hunters who do occasionally participate in persistence hunting are able to do so because of the extremely hot and open environments. In these groups, a full day of rest and recovery is required after a hunt, indicating the great toll persistence hunts take on the body, making them rare undertakings.&lt;ref name=number9 /&gt;

Finally, in critique of Liebenberg's research on modern day persistence hunting, it was revealed that the majority of the hunts initiated were prompted for filming rather than spontaneous, and that few of these hunts were successful. The hunts that were successful involved external factors such as the hunters being able to stop and refill water bottles.&lt;ref name=number9 /&gt;

A response to these criticisms has been formulated by Lieberman et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The evolution of endurance running and the tyranny of ethnography: A reply to Pickering and Bunn (2007)|url=http://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/3743587/2007i.pdf?sequence=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; noting that it is unclear how humans could have grown to occupy a new niche as a diurnal social carnivore without persistence hunting, as the weapons preferred in modern hunter-gatherer tribes would not have been available at the time.

===Against scavenging===
The proposed benefit of endurance running in scavenging is the ability of early hominins to outcompete other scavengers in reaching food sources.&lt;ref name=number9 /&gt; However paleoanthropological studies suggest that the savanna-woodland habitat caused a very low competition environment. Due to low visibility, carcasses were not easily located by mammalian carnivores, resulting in less competition.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26469">In mathematics, '''equivalent definitions''' are used in two somewhat different ways. First, within a particular mathematical theory (for example, [[Euclidean geometry]]), a notion (for example, [[Ellipse#Definition|ellipse]] or [[Minimal surface#Definitions|minimal surface]]) may have more than one definition. These definitions are equivalent in the context of a given [[mathematical structure]] ([[Euclidean space]], in this case). Second, a mathematical structure may have more than one definition (for example, [[topological space]] has at least [[Characterizations of the category of topological spaces|seven definitions]]; [[ordered field]] has at least [[Ordered field#Definition|two definitions]]).

In the former case, equivalence of two definitions means that a mathematical object (for example, geometric body) satisfies one definition [[if and only if]] it satisfies the other definition.

In the latter case, the meaning of equivalence (between two definitions of a structure) is more complicated, since a structure is more abstract than an object. Many different objects may implement the same structure.

[[Natural number#Formal definitions|Natural numbers]] may be implemented as 0 = {{mset|&amp;nbsp;}}, 1 = {{mset|0}} = {{mset|{{mset|&amp;nbsp;}}}}, 2 = {{mset|0, 1}} = {{mset|{{mset|&amp;nbsp;}}, {{mset|{{mset|&amp;nbsp;}}}}}}, 3 = {{mset|0, 1, 2}} = {{mset|{{mset|&amp;nbsp;}}, {{mset|{{mset|&amp;nbsp;}}}}, {{mset|{{mset|&amp;nbsp;}}, {{mset|{{mset|&amp;nbsp;}}}}}}}} and so on; or alternatively as 0 = {{mset|&amp;nbsp;}}, 1 = {{mset|0}} ={{mset|{{mset|&amp;nbsp;}}}}, 2 = {{mset|1}} = {{mset|{{mset|{{mset|&amp;nbsp;}}}}}} and so on. These are two different but [[Isomorphism|isomorphic]] implementations of natural numbers in set theory.
They are isomorphic as models of [[Peano axioms#Models|Peano axioms]], that is, triples (''N'',0,''S'') where ''N'' is a set, 0 an element of ''N'', and ''S'' (called the [[successor function]]) a map of ''N'' to itself (satisfying appropriate conditions). In the first implementation ''S''(''n'') = ''n'' ∪ {{mset|''n''}}; in the second implementation ''S''(''n'') = {{mset|''n''}}. As emphasized in [[Benacerraf's identification problem]], the two implementations differ in their answer to the question whether 0 ∈ 2; however, this is not a legitimate question about natural numbers (since the relation ∈ is not stipulated by the relevant signature(s), see the next section).&lt;ref group="details"&gt;Technically, "0 ∈ 2" is an example of a non-transportable relation, see {{harvnb|Bourbaki|1968|loc=Sect.IV.1.3}}, {{harvnb|Marshall|Chuaqui|1991}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, different but isomorphic implementations are used for [[Complex number#Formal construction|complex numbers]].

==Deduced structures and cryptomorphisms==

The successor function ''S'' on natural numbers leads to [[Peano axioms#Arithmetic|arithmetic operations]], addition and multiplication, and the total order, thus endowing ''N'' with an [[Peano axioms#Equivalent axiomatizations|ordered semiring]] structure. This is an example of a deduced structure. The ordered semiring structure (''N'', +, ·, ≤) is deduced from the Peano structure (''N'', 0, ''S'') by the following procedure:
''n'' + 0 = ''n'', &amp;nbsp; ''m'' + S (''n'') = S (''m'' + ''n''), &amp;nbsp; ''m'' · 0 = 0, &amp;nbsp; ''m'' · S (''n'') = ''m'' + (''m'' · ''n''), and ''m'' ≤ ''n'' if and only if there exists ''k'' ∈ ''N'' such that ''m'' + ''k'' = ''n''. And conversely, the Peano structure is deduced from the ordered semiring structure as follows: ''S'' (''n'') = ''n'' + 1, and 0 is defined by 0 + 0 = 0. It means that the two structures on ''N'' are equivalent by means of the two procedures.

The two isomorphic implementations of natural numbers, mentioned in the previous section, are isomorphic as triples (''N'',0,''S''), that is, structures of the same [[Signature (logic)|signature]] (0,''S'') consisting of a constant symbol 0 and a unary function ''S''. An ordered semiring structure (''N'', +, ·, ≤) has another signature (+, ·, ≤) consisting of two binary functions and one binary relation. The notion of isomorphism does not apply to structures of different signatures. In particular, a Peano structure cannot be isomorphic to an ordered semiring. However, an ordered semiring deduced from a Peano structure may be isomorphic to another ordered semiring. Such relation between structures of different signatures is sometimes called a [[cryptomorphism]].

==Ambient frameworks==

A structure may be implemented within a set theory [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZFC]], or another set theory such as [[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory|NBG]], [[New Foundations|NFU]], [[Elementary theory of the category of sets|ETCS]].&lt;ref&gt;About ETCS see [[Type theory#Mathematical foundations]]&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, a structure may be treated in the framework of [[first-order logic]], [[second-order logic]], [[higher-order logic]], a [[type theory]], [[homotopy type theory]] etc.&lt;ref group="details"&gt;A reasonable choice of an ambient framework should not alter basic properties of a structure, but can alter provability of finer properties. For example, some theorems about the natural numbers are provable in set theory (and some other strong systems) but not provable in first-order logic; see [[Paris–Harrington theorem]] and [[Goodstein's theorem]]. The same applies to definability; see for example [[Tarski's undefinability theorem]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structures according to Bourbaki==

:"Mathematics [...] cannot be explained completely by a single concept such as the mathematical structure. Nevertheless, Bourbaki's structuralist approach is the best that we have." ({{harvnb|Pudlák|2013|loc=page 3}})

:"Evident as the notion of mathematical structure may seem these days, it was at least not made explicit until the middle of the 20th century. Then it was the influence of the Bourbaki-project and then later the development of category theory which made the notion explicit" ([http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/structure#related_entries nLab]).

According to [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki]], the scale of sets on a given set ''X'' consists of all sets arising from ''X'' by taking [[Cartesian product]]s and [[power set]]s, in any combination, a finite number of times. Examples: ''X''; ''X'' × ''X''; ''P''(''X''); ''P''(''P''(''X'' × ''X'') × ''X'' × ''P''(''P''(''X''))) × ''X''. (Here ''A'' × ''B'' is the product of ''A'' and ''B'', and ''P''(''A'') is the powerset of ''A''.) In particular, a pair (0,''S'') consisting of an element 0 ∈ ''N'' and a unary function ''S'' : ''N'' → ''N'' belongs to ''N'' × ''P''(''N'' × ''N'') (since [[Function (mathematics)#Definition|a function is a subset of the Cartesian product]]). A triple (+, ·, ≤) consisting of two binary functions ''N'' × ''N'' → ''N'' and one binary relation on ''N'' belongs to ''P''(''N'' × ''N'' × ''N'')  × ''P''(''N'' × ''N'' × ''N'')  × ''P''(''N'' × ''N''). Similarly, every algebraic structure on a set belongs to the corresponding set in the scale of sets on ''X''.

Non-algebraic structures on a set ''X'' often involve sets of subsets of ''X'' (that is, subsets of ''P''(''X''), in other words, elements of ''P''(''P''(''X''))). For example, the structure of a [[topological space]], called a topology on ''X'', treated as [[Topological space#Open sets definition|the set of "open" sets]]; or the structure of a measurable space, treated as the [[Sigma-algebra|σ-algebra]] of "measurable" sets; both are elements of ''P''(''P''(''X'')). These are second-order structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pudlák|2013|loc=pages 10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More complicated non-algebraic structures combine an algebraic component and a non-algebraic component. For example, the structure of a [[topological group]] consists of a topology and the structure of a group. Thus it belongs to the product of ''P''(''P''(''X'')) and another ("algebraic") set in the scale; this product is again a set in the scale.

===Transport of structures; isomorphism===

{{main article|Transport of structure}}

Given two sets ''X'', ''Y'' and a [[bijection]] ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'', one constructs the corresponding bijections between scale sets. Namely, the bijection ''X'' × ''X'' → ''Y'' × ''Y'' sends (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to (''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;),''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)); the bijection ''P''(''X'') → ''P''(''Y'') sends a subset ''A'' of ''X'' into its [[Image (mathematics)|image]] ''f''(''A'') in ''Y''; and so on, recursively: a scale set being either product of scale sets or power set of a scale set, one of the two constructions applies.

Let (''X'',''U'') and (''Y'',''V'') be two structures of the same signature. Then ''U'' belongs to a scale set ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''V'' belongs to the corresponding scale set ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt;. Using the bijection ''F'' : ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; → ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt; constructed from a bijection ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'', one defines:
: ''f'' is an ''isomorphism'' between (''X'',''U'') and (''Y'',''V'') if ''F''(''U'') = ''V''.
This general notion of isomorphism generalizes many less general notions listed below.

In fact, Bourbaki stipulates two additional features. First, several sets ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; (so-called principal base sets) may be used, rather than a single set ''X''. However, this feature is of little use. All the items listed above use a single principal base set. Second, so-called auxiliary base sets ''E''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; may be used. This feature is widely used. Indeed, the structure of a vector space stipulates not only addition ''X'' × ''X'' → ''X'' but also scalar multiplication '''R''' × ''X'' → ''X'' (if '''R''' is the field of scalars). Thus, '''R''' is an auxiliary base set (called also "external"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pudlák|2013|loc=page 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The scale of sets consists of all sets arising from all base sets (both principal and auxiliary) by taking Cartesian products and power sets. Still, the map ''f'' (possibly an isomorphism) acts on ''X'' only; auxiliary sets are endowed by identity maps. (However, the case of ''n'' principal sets leads to ''n'' maps.)

===Functoriality===

Several statements formulated by Bourbaki without mentioning categories can be reformulated readily in the language of [[category theory]]. First, some terminology. 
* The scale of sets is indexed by "echelon construction schemes",&lt;ref name="B-IV.1.1"&gt;{{harvnb|Bourbaki|1968|loc=Sect.IV.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; called also "types".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pudlák|2013|loc=page 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marshall|Chuaqui|1991|loc=§2}}&lt;/ref&gt; One may think of, say, the set ''P''(''P''(''X'' × ''X'') × ''X'' × ''P''(''P''(''X''))) × ''X'' as a set ''X'' substituted into the formula "''P''(''P''(''a'' × ''a'') × ''a'' × ''P''(''P''(''a''))) × ''a''" for the variable ''a''; this formula is the corresponding echelon construction scheme.&lt;ref group="details"&gt;In order to be more formal, Bourbaki encodes such formulas with sequences of ordered pairs of natural numbers.&lt;/ref&gt; (This notion, defined for all structures, may be thought of as a generalization of the signature defined only for algebraic structures.)&lt;ref group="details"&gt;On one hand, it is possible to exclude the Cartesian products, treating a pair (''x'',''y'') as just the set {{''x''},{''x'',''y''}}. On the other hand, it is possible to include the set operation ''X'',''Y''-&gt;''Y''&lt;sup&gt;''X''&lt;/sup&gt; (all functions from ''X'' to ''Y''). "It is possible to simplify the matter by considering operations and functions as a special kind of relations (for example, a binary operation is a ternary relation). However, quite often, it is an advantage to have operations as a primitive concept."  {{harvnb|Pudlák|2013|loc=page 17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Let '''Set*''' denote the [[groupoid]] of sets and bijections. That is, the category whose objects are (all) sets, and morphisms are (all) bijections.

''Proposition.'' &lt;ref name="B-IV.1.2"&gt;{{harvnb|Bourbaki|1968|loc=Sect.IV.1.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each echelon construction scheme leads to a functor from '''Set*''' to itself.

In particular, the [[permutation group]] of a set ''X'' [[Group action|acts]] on every scale set ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;.

In order to formulate one more proposition, the notion "species of structures" is needed, since echelon construction scheme gives only preliminary information on a structure. For example, commutative groups and (arbitrary) groups are two different species of the same echelon construction scheme. Another example: topological spaces and measurable spaces. They differ in the so-called axiom of the species. This axiom is the conjunction of all required properties, such as "multiplication is associative" for groups, or "the union of open sets is an open set" for topological spaces.
* A species of structures consists of an echelon construction scheme and an axiom of the species.

''Proposition.'' &lt;ref name="B-IV.1.5"&gt;{{harvnb|Bourbaki|1968|loc=Sect.IV.1.5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each species of structures leads to a functor from '''Set*''' to itself.

Example. For the species of groups, the functor ''F'' maps a set ''X'' to the set ''F''(''X'') of all group structures on ''X''. For the species of topological spaces, the functor ''F'' maps a set ''X'' to the set ''F''(''X'') of all topologies on ''X''. The morphism ''F''(''f'') : ''F''(''X'') → ''F''(''Y'') corresponding to a bijection ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' is the transport of structures. Topologies on ''Y'' correspond bijectively to topologies on ''X''. The same holds for group structures, etc.

In particular, the set of all structures of a given species on a given set is invariant under the action of the permutation group on the corresponding scale set ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;, and is a [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]] of the action of the group on another scale set ''P''(''S''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;). However, not all fixed points of this action correspond to species of structures.&lt;ref group="details"&gt;The set of all possible axioms of species is [[Countable set|countable]], while the set of all fixed points of the considered action may be uncountable. Tarski's "[[Alfred Tarski#What are logical notions?|logical notions of higher order]]" are closer to the fixed points than to species of structures, see {{harvnb|Feferman|2010}} and references therefrom.&lt;/ref&gt;

Given two species, Bourbaki defines the notion "procedure of deduction" (of a structure of the second species from a structure of the first species).&lt;ref name="B-IV.1.6"&gt;{{harvnb|Bourbaki|1968|loc=Sect.IV.1.6}}&lt;/ref&gt; A pair of mutually inverse procedures of deduction leads to the notion "equivalent species".&lt;ref name="B-IV.1.7"&gt;{{harvnb|Bourbaki|1968|loc=Sect.IV.1.7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Example. The structure of a topological space may be defined as an [[Topological space#Open sets definition|open set topology]] or alternatively, a [[Topological space#Closed sets definition|closed set topology]]. The two corresponding procedures of deduction coincide; each one replaces all given subsets of ''X'' with their complements. In this sense, these are two equivalent species.

In the general definition of Bourbaki, deduction procedure may include a change of the principal base set(s), but this case is not treated here. In the language of category theory one have the following result.

''Proposition.'' &lt;ref name="B-IV.1.7" /&gt; Equivalence between two species of structures leads to a [[Natural transformation#Definition|natural isomorphism]] between the corresponding functors.

However, in general, not all natural isomorphisms between these functors correspond to equivalences between the species.&lt;ref group="details"&gt;The set of all possible deduction procedures is countable, while the set of all natural isomorphisms between the considered functors may be uncountable (see an example in Section [[#Canonical, not just natural]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical practice==

:"We often do not distinguish structures that are isomorphic and often say that {{'}}''two structures are the same, up to isomorphism''{{'}}."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pudlák|2013|loc=page 13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:"When studying structures we are interested only in their form, but when we prove their existence we need to construct them."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pudlák|2013|loc=page 22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:'Mathematicians are of course used to identifying isomorphic structures in practice, but they generally do so by "abuse of notation", or some other informal device, knowing that the objects involved are not "really" identical.'&lt;ref name="HoTT"&gt;{{harvnb|The Univalent Foundations Program|2013|loc=Subsection "Univalent foundations" of Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; (A radically better approach is expected; but for now, Summer 2014, the definitive book quoted above does not elaborate on structures.)

In practice, one makes no distinction between equivalent species of structures.&lt;ref name="B-IV.1.7" /&gt;

Usually, a text based on natural numbers (for example, the article "[[prime number]]") does not specify the used definition of natural numbers. Likewise, a text based on topological spaces (for example, the article "[[homotopy]]", or "[[inductive dimension]]") does not specify the used definition of a topological space. Thus, it is possible (and rather probable) that the reader and the author interpret the text differently, according to different definitions. Nevertheless, the communication is successful, which means that such different definitions may be thought of as equivalent.

A person acquainted with topological spaces knows basic relations between neighborhoods, convergence, continuity, boundary, closure, interior, open sets, closed sets, and does not need to know that some of these notions are "primary", stipulated in the definition of a topological space, while others are "secondary", characterized in terms of "primary" notions. Moreover, knowing that subsets of a topological space are themselves topological spaces, as well as products of topological spaces, the person is able to construct some new topological spaces irrespective of the definition.

Thus, in practice a topology on a set is treated like an [[abstract data type]] that provides all needed notions (and [[Constructor (object-oriented programming)|constructors]]) but hides the distinction between "primary" and "secondary" notions. The same applies to other kinds of mathematical structures. "Interestingly, the formalization of structures in set theory is a similar task as the formalization of structures for computers."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pudlák|2013|loc=page 34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canonical, not just natural==

As was mentioned, equivalence between two species of structures leads to a natural isomorphism between the corresponding functors. However, "[[Natural transformation|natural]]" does not mean "[[Canonical map|canonical]]". A natural transformation is generally non-unique.

Example. Consider again the two equivalent structures for natural numbers. One is the "Peano structure" (0,''S''), the other is the structure (+, ·, ≤) of ordered semiring. If a set ''X'' is endowed by both structures then, on one hand, ''X'' = {{mset| ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... }} where ''S''(''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; for all ''n'' and 0 = ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;; and on the other hand, ''X'' = {{mset| ''b''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... }} where ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''m''+''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; + ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''m''·''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; · ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;  ≤''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; if and only if ''m'' ≤ ''n''. Requiring that ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; for all ''n'' one gets the canonical equivalence between the two structures. However, one may also require ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''b''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; for all ''n'' &gt; 1, thus getting another, non-canonical, natural isomorphism. Moreover, every [[permutation]] of the index set {{mset| 0, 1, 2, ... }} leads to a natural isomorphism; they are uncountably many!

Another example. A structure of a (simple) graph on a set ''V'' = {{mset| 1, 2, ..., n }} of vertices may be described by means of its [[adjacency matrix]], a (0,1)-matrix of size ''n''×''n'' (with zeros on the diagonal). More generally, for arbitrary ''V'' an adjacency function on ''V'' × ''V'' may be used. The canonical equivalence is given by the rule: "1" means "connected" (with an edge), "0" means "not connected". However, another rule, "0" means "connected", "1" means "not", may be used, and leads to another, natural but not canonical, equivalence. In this example, canonicity is rather a matter of convention. But here is a worse case. Instead of "0" and "1" one may use, say, the two possible orientations of the plane '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ("clockwise" and "counterclockwise"). It is difficult to choose a canonical rule in this case!

"Natural" is a well-defined mathematical notion, but it does not ensure uniqueness. "Canonical" does, but generally is more or less conventional. A consistent choice of canonical equivalences is an inevitable component of equivalent definitions of mathematical structures.

Jurisdictions vary as to whether they make such disfranchisement permanent, or restore suffrage after a person has served a sentence, or completed [[parole]] or [[probation]].&lt;ref name="Bowers and Preuh"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bowers|first=Melanie M|author2=Preuhs, Robert R|title=Collateral Consequences of a Collateral Penalty: The Negative Effect of Felon Disenfranchisement Laws on the Political Participation of Nonfelons|journal=Social Science Quarterly|date=September 2009|volume=90|issue=3|pages=722–743|doi=10.1111/j.1540-6237.2009.00640.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Felony disenfranchisement is one among the [[collateral consequences of criminal conviction]] and the [[loss of rights due to conviction for criminal offense]].&lt;ref name=Siegel&gt;{{cite journal|last=Siegel|first=Jonah A.|title=Felon Disenfranchisement and the Fight for Universal Suffrage.|journal=Social Work|date=January 1, 2011|volume=56|issue=1|pages=89–91|doi=10.1093/sw/56.1.89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents have argued that persons who commit felonies have 'broken' the social contract, and have thereby given up their right to participate in a civil society. Some argue that felons have shown poor judgment, and that they should therefore not have a voice in the political decision-making process.&lt;ref&gt;Eli L. Levine, "Does the Social Contract Justify Felony Disenfranchisement?", 1 ''Wash. U. Jur. Rev.'' 193 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents have argued that such disfranchisement restricts and conflicts with principles of [[universal suffrage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]] and the Sentencing Project |url=http://www.sentencingproject.org/doc/File/FVR/fd_losingthevote.pdf |format=PDF |title=LOSING THE VOTE: The Impact of Felony Disenfranchisement Laws in the United States |date=October 1998 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100710055712/http://www.sentencingproject.org/doc/File/FVR/fd_losingthevote.pdf |archivedate=2010-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can affect civic and communal participation in general.&lt;ref name="Bowers and Preuh" /&gt;  Opponents argue that felony disenfranchisement can create dangerous political incentives to skew criminal law in favor of disproportionately targeting groups who are political opponents of those who hold power.

==History==
In Western countries, felony disenfranchisement can be traced back to ancient Greek and Roman traditions: disenfranchisement was commonly imposed as part of the punishment on those convicted of "infamous" crimes, as part of their "[[civil death]]", whereby these persons would lose all rights and claim to [[property]]. Most medieval [[common law]] jurisdictions developed punishments that provided for some form of exclusion from the community for felons, ranging from [[outlaw|execution on sight]] to exclusion from community processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:SD7ENGyN880J:www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/blj/vol22/schall.pdf+outlaw+disenfranchisement+%22Common+law%22&amp;gl=uk&amp;pid=bl |title=pages-schall.blj.doc – Powered by Google Docs |publisher=docs.google.com |accessdate=2010-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Background===
The [[United States]] is among the most punitive nations in the world when it comes to denying the vote to those who have been convicted of a felony offense.&lt;ref name="guardian-12"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/18/should-convicted-felons-be-allowed-to-vote-after-theyve-served-their-time/&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., the Constitution implicitly permits the states to adopt rules about disenfranchisement "for participation in rebellion, or other crime", by the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], section&amp;nbsp;2. It is up to the states to decide which crimes could be grounds for disenfranchisement, and they are not formally bound to restrict this to felonies; however, in most cases, they do.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Felons who have completed their sentences are allowed to vote in most U.S. states. Between 1996 and 2008 twenty-eight states changed their laws on felon voting rights, mostly to restore rights or to simplify the process of restoration. Since 2008 state laws have continued to shift, both curtailing and restoring voter rights, sometimes over short periods of time within the same state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Felon Voting Rights|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/felon-voting-rights.aspx|publisher=National Conference of State Legislatures|accessdate=March 13, 2016|date=January 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In several Southern states, felony disenfranchisement was implemented as part of a strategy to bar blacks from voting. Conjoint with felony disenfranchisement, these Southern states implemented [[Black Codes (United States)|Black Codes]] which established severe penalties for petty crimes and were used to target black Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/26/magazine/ex-felons-voting-rights-florida.html|title=Will Florida’s Ex-Felons Finally Regain the Right to Vote?|access-date=2018-10-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current practices===
As of 2008 over 5.3 million people in the United States were denied the right to vote due to felony disenfranchisement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tomes Magazine|date=November 1, 2008|publisher=Reason|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1553510,00.html|first=Reynolds|last=Holding}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the national elections in 2012, the various state felony disenfranchisement laws together blocked an estimated 5.85 million felons from voting, up from 1.2 million in 1976. This comprised 2.5% of the potential voters in general. The state with the highest number of disenfranchised voters was Florida, with 1.5 million disenfranchised.&lt;ref name="guardian-12"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/13/felon-voting-laws-disenfranchisement|title=Felon voting laws to disenfranchise historic number of Americans in 2012|author=Pilkington, Ed|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=July 13, 2012|accessdate=2013-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reform efforts===
Felony disenfranchisement was a topic of debate during the [[Republican Party presidential debates, 2012|2012 Republican presidential primary]]. Primary candidate [[Rick Santorum]] from Pennsylvania argued for the restoration of voting rights for convicted felons who had completed sentences and parole/probation.&lt;ref name="motherjones"&gt;{{cite web|author=Tim Murphy |url=https://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2012/01/rick-santorum-voting-rights-activist |title=Rick Santorum, Voting Rights Activist |work=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] |accessdate=2013-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Santorum's position was attacked and distorted by [[Mitt Romney]], who alleged that Santorum supported voting rights for felons while [[incarceration|incarcerated]].&lt;ref name="motherjones" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2012/jan/17/restore-our-future/super-pac-rick-santorum-felon-voting-rights/ |title=PolitiFact Florida &amp;#124; Super PAC attacks Rick Santorum for supporting felon voting rights |publisher=[[Politifact.com]] |accessdate=2013-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former President [[Barack Obama]] supports voting rights for ex-offenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://2012election.procon.org/sourcefiles/NAACP-questionnaire.pdf |title=The NAACP 2008 Presidential Candidate Civil Rights Questionnaire |publisher=2012election.procon.org |accessdate=2013-11-08|quote="I support restoration of voting rights for ex-offenders. I am a cosponsor of the Count Every Vote Act, and would sign that legislation into law as president."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years 1997 to 2008, there was a trend to lift the disenfranchisement restrictions, or simplify the procedures for applying for the restoration of civil rights for persons who had fulfilled their punishments for felonies. As a result, in 2008 more than a half million people had the right to vote who would have been disenfranchised under the older rules.&lt;ref name="SP"&gt;{{cite web|title=Felony Disenfranchisement Laws in the United States |publisher=[[The Sentencing Project]] |date=March 2011 |url=http://www.sentencingproject.org/doc/publications/fd_statedisenfranchisement.pdf |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119133453/http://www.sentencingproject.org/doc/publications/fd_statedisenfranchisement.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, more severe disenfranchisement rules have been passed in several states.

===State reforms===
In 2007, [[Florida]]'s Republican Governor [[Charlie Crist]] pushed to make it easier for most convicted felons to regain their voting rights reasonably quickly after serving their sentences and probation terms.&lt;ref name=Crist&gt;{{Cite news

Felons were not able to apply to the court for restoration of voting rights until seven years after completion of sentence, probation and parole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Steve Bousquet |url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/crime/state-toughens-policy-of-restoring-rights-to--freed-felons/1184821 |title=State toughens policy of restoring rights to freed felons &amp;#124; Tampa Bay Times |publisher=Tampabay.com |date=2011-08-07 |accessdate=2013-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020012121/http://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/crime/state-toughens-policy-of-restoring-rights-to--freed-felons/1184821 |archivedate=2013-10-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 6, 2018, Florida voters approved an amendment to the state constitution to automatically restore voting rights to convicted felons who have served their sentences.&lt;ref name="voxreveal"/&gt; Lifetime bans still apply for those convicted of either murder or sexual offenses.&lt;ref name=cnbcnov2018&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/06/florida-restores-voting-rights-to-more-than-1-million-former-felons.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=voxreveal&gt;https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/11/6/18052374/florida-amendment-4-felon-voting-rights-results&lt;/ref&gt;

In Iowa in July 2005, Democratic Governor [[Tom Vilsack]] issued an executive order restoring the right to vote for all persons who had completed supervision.&lt;ref name="SP"/&gt;  On October 31, 2005, Iowa's Supreme Court upheld mass re-enfranchisement of convicted felons. But, on his inauguration day, January 14, 2011, Republican Governor [[Terry Branstad]] reversed Vilsack's executive order, disenfranchising thousands of people.&lt;ref name="huffpo"&gt;{{cite news|last=Foley |first=Ryan J. |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/24/iowa-felons-voting-rights-terry-branstad_n_1622742.html |title=Iowa Felons' Voting Rights: Terry Brandstad Executive Order Disenfranchises Thousands |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |accessdate=2013-11-08 |date=2012-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Virginia legislature in 2017 debated relaxation of the [[Felony disenfranchisement in Virginia|state's policy]] that restoration of voting rights requires an individual act by the governor.&lt;ref name="ta171024"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ford|first1=Matt|title=The Strangest Political Attack Ad of 2017|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/10/gillespie-criminal-justice-ad/543762/|accessdate=4 January 2018|publisher=The Atlantic|date=October 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nine other states disenfranchise felons for various lengths of time following their conviction. Except for Maine and Vermont every state prohibits felons from voting while in prison.&lt;ref name="SP"/&gt;

{{as of|2018}}, Iowa and Kentucky are the only two states with lifetime voting bans for felons, regardless of the crime committed.&lt;ref name=cnbcnov2018 /&gt;

===Constitutionality===
Unlike most laws that burden the right of citizens to vote based on some form of social status, felony disenfranchisement laws have been held to be [[constitutional]].  In ''[[Richardson v. Ramirez]]'' (1974), the [[United States Supreme Court]] upheld the constitutionality of felon disenfranchisement statutes, finding that the practice did not deny equal protection to disenfranchised voters. The Court looked to Section 2 of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], which proclaims that States in which adult male citizens are denied the right to vote for any reason other than "participation in rebellion, or other crime," will suffer a reduction in the basis of their [[United States congressional apportionment|representation in Congress]]. Based on this language, the Court found that this amounted to an "affirmative sanction" of the practice of felon disenfranchisement, and the 14th Amendment could not prohibit in one section that which is expressly authorized in another.

But, critics{{who|date=September 2018}} of the practice argue that Section 2 of the 14th Amendment allows, but does not represent an endorsement of, felony disenfranchisement statutes as constitutional in light of the [[equal protection clause]] and is limited only to the issue of reduced representation. The Court ruled in ''[[Hunter v. Underwood]]'' 471 U.S. 222, 232 (1985) that a state's crime disenfranchisement provision will violate Equal Protection if it can be demonstrated that the provision, as enacted, had "both [an] impermissible racial motivation and racially discriminatory impact." (The law in question also disenfranchised people convicted of vagrancy, adultery, and any misdemeanor "involving [[moral turpitude]]"; the test case involved two individuals who faced disenfranchisement for presenting [[Cheque fraud|invalid checks]], which the state authorities had found to be morally [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/turpid turpid] behavior.)  A felony disenfranchisement law, which on its face is indiscriminate in nature, cannot be invalidated by the Supreme Court unless its enforcement is proven to racially discriminate and to have been enacted with racially discriminatory [[animus nocendi|animus]].{{Citation needed|reason=In ''Hunter v. Underwood'', the S.C. explicitly did not endorse the constitutionality of designing disenfranchisement to deprive poor whites suffrage to undermine support for an opposition party; but there then was no further need for them to decide finally one way or the other. This means that the question was left open.|date=August 2014}}

===Classifications===
Restoration of voting rights for people who are ex-offenders varies across the United States. Primary classification of voting rights include:

====Unrestricted====
[[Maine]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mainelegislature.org/legis/statutes/21-A/title21-Asec112.html |title=Title 21-A, §112: Residence for voting purposes |publisher=Mainelegislature.org |date=2012-10-16 |accessdate=2013-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vermont]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.vt.us/statutes/fullsection.cfm?Title=17&amp;Chapter=043&amp;Section=02121 |title=The Vermont Statutes Online |publisher=Leg.state.vt.us |date=2011-06-01 |accessdate=2013-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; are the only states with unrestricted voting rights for people who are felons.  Both states allow the person to vote during incarceration, via [[absentee ballot]] and after terms of conviction end.

====Ends after release====
In fourteen states and the District of Columbia, disenfranchisement ends after incarceration is complete:

In February 2016 the [[Maryland]] General Assembly restored the right to vote for more than 40,000 released felons, overriding a veto by Governor [[Larry Hogan]]. Maryland's Senate approved the bill on a narrow 29-18 vote, while the state House of Delegates voted 85-56 in favor of it on January 20. Convicted felons under parole or probation had their right to vote restored. The law went into effect in late March, one month before the state's April 26 primaries.&lt;ref name="restore"&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/02/maryland-felon-voting/462000/ Matt Ford, "Restoring Voting Rights for Felons in Maryland"], ''The Atlantic,'' 9 February 2016, accessed 23 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

====Circumstantial====
Six states have laws that relate disenfranchisement to the detail of the crime. These laws restore voting rights to some offenders on the completion of incarceration, parole, and probation. Other offenders must make an individual petition that could be denied.

*[[Alabama]] –  A person convicted of a felony loses the ability to vote if the felony involves moral turpitude. Prior to 2017, the state Attorney General and courts have decided this for individual crimes; however, in 2017, moral turpitude was defined by House Bill 282 of 2017, signed into law by [[Kay Ivey]] on May 24, to constitute 47 specific offenses.&lt;ref name=2017law&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://legiscan.com/AL/text/HB282/2017|title=Bill Text: AL HB282, 2017, Regular Session, Engrossed|accessdate=January 25, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If a convicted person loses the ability to vote based on having committed a defined act of moral turpitude, he can petition to have it restored by a pardon or by a certificate of eligibility; if the loss of elective franchise was based on a crime not under moral turpitude, eligibility to vote is automatically restored once all sentence conditions have been satisfied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alisondb.legislature.state.al.us/acas/CodeOfAlabama/1975/17-3-31.htm |title=Section 17-3-31 |publisher=Alisondb.legislature.state.al.us |accessdate=2013-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107072426/http://alisondb.legislature.state.al.us/acas/CodeOfAlabama/1975/17-3-31.htm |archivedate=2014-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="al-pardons"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pardons.state.al.us/alabpp/Divisions/Pardons/pardons_unit.htm |title=Alabama Pardons Unit |publisher=Pardons.state.al.us |accessdate=2013-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107072227/http://www.pardons.state.al.us/alabpp/Divisions/Pardons/pardons_unit.htm |archivedate=2014-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=NACDL|title=State narrative: Alabama|url=https://www.nacdl.org/uploadedFiles/files/resource_center/2012_restoration_project/state_narr_al.pdf|work=NACDL Jurisdiction Profiles|accessdate=7 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alabama ex-felon voting brochure 2010|url=http://www.aclualabama.org/WhatWeDo/ALExFelonVotingBrochure2010.pdf|publisher=ACLU of Alabama|accessdate=7 January 2014|year=2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107071155/http://www.aclualabama.org/WhatWeDo/ALExFelonVotingBrochure2010.pdf|archive-date=7 January 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to 2017, a person convicted of a number of crimes having to do with sexual assault or abuse, including [[sodomy]], was ineligible to receive a certificate of eligibility; today, only impeachment and treason remain ineligible for a certificate of eligibility.&lt;ref name="pardons"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pardons.state.al.us/alabpp/Divisions/Pardons/pardons_unit.htm |title=Pardons Unit |publisher=Pardons.state.al.us |accessdate=2013-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107072227/http://www.pardons.state.al.us/alabpp/Divisions/Pardons/pardons_unit.htm |archivedate=2014-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Mississippi]] – A convicted person loses suffrage for numerous crimes identified in the state constitution, Section 241 (see note). The list is given below. Suffrage can be restored to an individual by a two-thirds vote of both houses of the legislature. The crimes that disqualify a person from voting are given in Section 241 of the state constitution as: murder, rape, bribery, theft, arson, obtaining money or goods under false pretense, [[perjury]], [[forgery]], [[embezzlement]] or [[bigamy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sos.state.ms.us/ed_pubs/constitution/constitution.asp |title=Constitution Of The State Of Mississippi |publisher=Sos.state.ms.us |accessdate=2013-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Voting rights in the United States}}

==In Europe==
In general, during the recent centuries, the European countries have increasingly made suffrage more accessible. This has included retaining disenfranchisement in fewer and fewer cases, including for criminal offenses. Moreover, most European states, including most of those outside the [[European Union]], have ratified the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], and thereby agreed to respect the decisions of the [[European Court of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;In the neutral field in Strasbourg is still wide open the play on rule of law in electoral matters: {{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title = Decreto Severino: c'è un giudice a Strasburgo|journal= Mondoperaio edizione online|date=2015| url= https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89429887}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case ''[[Hirst v United Kingdom (No 2)]]'' the Court in 2005 found that general rules for automatic disenfranchisements resulting from convictions to be against human rights. This ruling applied equally for prisoners and for ex-convicts. The ruling did not exclude the possibility of disenfranchisement as a consequence of deliberation in individual cases (such as that of [[Mohammed Bouyeri]]). The United Kingdom has not respected this Court opinion, although it is a signatory to the Convention (see below).

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, prohibitions from voting are codified in section 3 and 3A of the [[Representation of the People Act 1983]].&lt;ref name = RPA83&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=2353486 |title=Representation of the People Act 1983 (c. 2) – Statute Law Database |publisher=www.statutelaw.gov.uk |accessdate=2010-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Excluded are incarcerated criminals&lt;ref&gt;although not specifically felons; the distinction between felony and misdemeanor was abolished by the [[Criminal Law Act 1967]]&lt;/ref&gt; (including those sentenced by [[courts-martial]], those unlawfully at large from such sentences, and those committed to psychiatric institutions as a result of a criminal court sentencing process). Civil prisoners sentenced (for non-payment of fines, or [[contempt of court]], for example), and those on [[Remand (detention)|remand]] unsentenced retain the right to vote.

The UK is subject to Europe-wide rules due to various treaties and agreements associated with its membership of the [[European Community]]. The Act does not apply to elections to the [[European Parliament]]. Following ''[[Hirst v United Kingdom (No 2)]]'' (2005),&lt;ref&gt;42 EHHR 41&lt;/ref&gt; in which the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECHR) ruled such a ban to be disproportionate, the policy was reviewed by the UK government. In 2005 the [[Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs]], [[Charles Falconer, Baron Falconer of Thoroton|Lord Falconer of Thoroton]], stated that the review may result in the UK allowing some prisoners to vote.&lt;ref name="uk-review"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4315348.stm |title=Convicts 'will not all get vote'|publisher=BBC News|date= October 6, 2005| accessdate= December 9, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 the UK was still reviewing the policy, following an "unprecedented warning" from the [[Council of Europe]].&lt;ref name = update&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/mar/09/prisoners-vote-general-election-europe |title=Prisoners must be allowed to vote, Council of Europe warns Britain |publisher=guardian.co.uk |accessdate=2010-10-30 |location=London |first=Alan |last=Travis |date=March 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK government position was then that

{{quote|It remains the government's view that the right to vote goes to the essence of the offender's relationship with democratic society, and the removal of the right to vote in the case of some convicted prisoners can be a proportionate and proper response following conviction and imprisonment. The issue of voting rights for prisoners is one that the government takes very seriously and that remains under careful consideration.&lt;ref name = update/&gt;}}

Parliament voted in favor of maintaining disenfranchisement of prisoners in 2011 in response to Government plans to introduce legislation. Since then the Government has repeatedly stated that prisoners will not be given the right to vote in spite of the ECHR ruling.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-20053244], 24 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the ECHR ruling, Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice [[Chris Grayling]] produced a draft [[Voting Eligibility (Prisoners) Bill]] for discussion by a Joint Committee, incorporating two clear options for reform and one which would retain the blanket ban.

For [[elections in the Republic of Ireland]], there is no disenfranchisement based on criminal conviction, and prisoners remain on the [[electoral register]] at their pre-imprisonment address.&lt;ref name="citizensinformation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/prison_system/prisoners_rights.html|title=Prisoners' Rights|publisher=Citizens Information Board|accessdate=25 October 2012|location=Ireland}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to 2006, the grounds for [[postal voting]] did not include imprisonment, and hence those in prison on election day were in practice unable to vote, although those on [[temporary release]] could do so.&lt;ref name="dail20061005"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://debates.oireachtas.ie/dail/2006/10/05/00008.asp |title=Dáil Eireann - 05/Oct/2006 Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2006: Second Stage |publisher=Debates.oireachtas.ie |date=2006-10-05 |accessdate=2013-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/europe-court-rules-prisoners-should-be-let-vote-in-elections-234642.html|title=Europe court rules prisoners should be let vote in elections|last=Quinn|first=Ben|author2=Conor Sweeney|date=7 October 2005|work=[[Irish Independent]]|accessdate=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 the [[High Court (Ireland)|High Court]] ruled that this breached the [[Constitution of Ireland|Constitution]], and the government drafted a [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] extending postal voting to prisoners on [[Detention of suspects|remand]] or serving sentences of less than six months.&lt;ref name="ind226084"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/goahead-for-prisoners-to-cast-vote-at-next-election-226084.html |title=Go-ahead for prisoners to cast vote at next election |last=Brady |first=Tom |date=15 December 2005 |work=[[Irish Independent]] |accessdate=26 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2001, the [[Supreme Court (Ireland)|Supreme Court]] overturned the High Court ruling and the bill was withdrawn.&lt;ref name="ind226084"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Breathnach -v- Ireland &amp; anor; [2001] IESC 59: Judgments of [http://courts.ie/Judgments.nsf/bce24a8184816f1580256ef30048ca50/fddba2cbc75b154e80256ccc005c3756?OpenDocument Keane C.J.] and [http://courts.ie/Judgments.nsf/bce24a8184816f1580256ef30048ca50/fded91c3fda8f0bf80256ccc00384f9a?OpenDocument Denham J.]&lt;/ref&gt;  After the 2005 ECHR ruling in [[Hirst v United Kingdom (No 2)|the Hirst case]], the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2006 was passed to allow postal voting by all prisoners.&lt;ref name="citizensinformation"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dail20061005"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2006/en/act/pub/0033/print.html |title=Electoral (Amendment) Act 2006 |publisher=Irishstatutebook.ie |accessdate=2013-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
In Italy, the most serious offenses involve the loss of voting rights, while for less serious offenses disqualification the judge can choose if there will be some disenfranchisement. Recently, however, the 'decree Severino' added a loss of only the right to stand for an election, against some offenders above a certain threshold of imprisonment:&lt;ref&gt;{{it}} [https://www.academia.edu/17100946/Dopo_la_sentenza_20_ottobre_2015 Severino: c'è un giudice a Strasburgo Mondoperaio, 21 ottobre 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; it operates administratively, with fixed duration and without intervention of the court. Many court actions have been presented, but the electoral disputes follows antiquated rules and the danger of causes seamless in terms of eligibility&lt;ref&gt;{{it}} [https://www.academia.edu/11436063/Il_contenzioso_elettorale_ai_diversi_livelli_istituzionali {{lang|it|Giampiero Buonomo, Il condannato?

===Other European countries===
Several European countries permit disenfranchisement by special court order, including France, Germany (reinstated after 2–5 years) and the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kiesraad.nl/verkiezingen/tweede-kamer/stemmen/uitsluiting-kiesrecht|title=Uitsluiting kiesrecht|last=Kiesraad|website=www.kiesraad.nl|language=nl-NL|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In several others, no disenfranchisements due to criminal convictions exist. Moreover, many European countries encourage people to vote, such as by making pre-voting in other places than the respective election locales easily accessible. This often includes possibilities for prisoners to pre-vote from the prison itself. This is the case for example in Finland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/1998/en19980714.pdf |title= Election Act 714/1998 |date= |year= 1998 |department= |website= Finlex |series= Translations of Finnish acts and decrees |publisher= Ministry of Justice, Finland |pages= 1, 24 |format= pdf |access-date= 25 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany the law calls on prisons to encourage prisoners to vote. Only those convicted of [[electoral fraud]] and crimes undermining the "democratic order", such as [[treason]], are barred from voting while in prison.&lt;ref&gt;"Losing the Vote," p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Australia==
At [[Federation of Australia|Federation]] in Australia the ''Commonwealth Franchise Act 1902'' denied the franchise to vote to anyone 'attainted of treason, or who had been convicted and is under sentence or subject to be sentenced for any offence ... punishable by imprisonment for one year or longer'.&lt;ref name=Hill&gt;{{citation|title=Prisoner voting rights|first=Lisa|last=Hill|publisher=Australian Review of Public Affairs|url=http://www.australianreview.net/digest/2009/11/hill.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130318061231/http://www.australianreview.net/digest/2009/11/hill.html|archivedate=18 March 2013|deadurl=no|date=November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983 this disqualification was relaxed and prisoners serving a sentence for a crime punishable under the law for less than a maximum five years were allowed to vote.&lt;ref name=Davidson&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/Publications_Archive/CIB/cib0304/04cib12|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301121320/http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/Publications_Archive/CIB/cib0304/04cib12|archivedate=1 March 2014|title=Inside outcasts: prisoners and the right to vote in Australia|deadurl=no|first=Jerome|last=Davidson|date=24 May 2004|publisher=Parliament of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further softening occurred in 1995 when the disenfranchisement was limited to those serving a sentence of five years or longer,&lt;ref name=Hill/&gt;&lt;ref name=Davidson/&gt; although earlier that year the [[Keating Government]] had been planning legislation to extend voting rights to all prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|first=Paul|last=Keating|title=For Media: Prisoner voting|date=10 July 1995|url=http://pmtranscripts.dpmc.gov.au/browse.php?did=9664|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140824135405/http://pmtranscripts.dpmc.gov.au/browse.php?did=9664|archivedate=24 August 2014|author-link=Paul Keating}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disenfranchisement does not continue after release from jail/prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Prisoners|url = http://www.aec.gov.au/Enrolling_to_vote/special_category/Prisoners.htm|website = Australian Electoral Commission|accessdate = 2015-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Howard Government]] legislated in 2006 to ban all prisoners from voting. In 2007, the [[High Court of Australia]] in ''[[Roach v Electoral Commissioner]]'' found that the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian constitution]] enshrined a limited right to vote,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/court-gives-vote-back-to-some-inmates/2007/08/30/1188067277253.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080824053414/http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/court-gives-vote-back-to-some-inmates/2007/08/30/1188067277253.html|archivedate=24 August 2008|title=Court gives vote back to some inmates|date=31 August 2007|first=Jonathan|last=Pearlman|publisher=Fairfax Media|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; which meant that citizens serving relatively short prison sentences (generally less than three years) cannot be barred from voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.humanrights.gov.au/publications/right-vote-not-enjoyed-equally-all-australians#fnB9a |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814083152/https://www.humanrights.gov.au/publications/right-vote-not-enjoyed-equally-all-australians |archivedate=14 August 2014 |title=The right to vote is not enjoyed equally by all Australians: 4.

Depending on the threshold of exclusion which is distinct in each state, a prisoner may be able to vote in either state elections or federal elections. For example, prisoners in New South Wales serving a sentence of longer than one year are not entitled to vote in state elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{ Cite Legislation AU |NSW|act|peea1912|Parliamentary Electorates and Elections Act 1912|25(b)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In other countries ==
Most democracies give convicted criminals the same voting rights as other citizens.

In [[Taiwan]] the abrogation of political rights is a form of punishment used in sentencing, available only for some crimes or along with a sentence of death or imprisonment for life. Rights that are suspended in such a sentence include the right to vote and to take public office, as well as the rights to political expression, assembly, association, and protest. In China, there is a similar punishment of [[Deprivation of Political Rights]].

In New Zealand, people who are in prison are not entitled to enroll while they are in prison. Persons who are convicted of electoral offenses in the past 3 years cannot vote or stand for office. In November 2018, the New Zealand Supreme Court ruled that such restrictions are inconsistent with the nation's Bill of Rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=12156876|archiveurl=http://archive.is/FBl2P|archivedate=9 November 2018|title=Supreme Court upholds decision saying ban on prisoner voting inconsistent with Bill of Rights
|date=9 November 2018|first=Sam|last=Hurley|publisher= New Zealand Media and Entertainment |newspaper= The New Zealand Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many countries allow inmates to vote, including  [[Canada]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/2010/index.do Sauvé v. Canada (Chief Electoral Officer), [2002&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; 3 SCR 519, 2002 SCC 68.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/E-2.01/section-245.html ''Canada Elections Act'', SC 2000, c 9, s 245.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Croatia]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Israel]], [[Kenya]], [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Peru]], [[Poland]], [[Romania]], [[Serbia]], [[Sweden]], and [[Zimbabwe]]. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

On 8 December 2008, [[Leung Kwok Hung]] (Long Hair), member of [[Hong Kong]]'s popularly elected [[Legislative Council]] (LegCo), and two prison inmates, successfully challenged disenfranchisement provisions in the LegCo electoral laws. The court found blanket disenfranchisement of prisoners to be in violation of Article 26 of the Basic Law and Article 21 of the Bill of Rights and the denial to persons in custody of access to polling stations as against the law. The government introduced a bill to repeal the provisions of the law disenfranchising persons convicted of crimes (even those against the electoral system) as well as similar ones found in other electoral laws, and it made arrangements for polling stations to be set up at detention centers and prisons. LegCo passed the bill, and it took effect from 31 October 2009, even though no major elections were held until the middle of 2011.

The '''Five Safes''' is a framework for helping make decisions about making effective use of data which is confidential or sensitive. It is mainly used to describe or design research access to statistical data held by government agencies, and by data archives such as the UK Data Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ukdataservice.ac.uk/use-data/secure-lab/security-philosophy|title=UK Data Service|website=www.ukdataservice.ac.uk|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of the Five Safes refer to [[statistical disclosure control]] (SDC), and so the Five Safes is usually used to contrast statistical and non-statistical controls when comparing data management options.

== Concept ==
The Five Safes proposes that data management decisions be considered as solving problems in five 'dimensions': projects, people, settings, data and outputs. These are most commonly expressed as questions, for example:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Desai|first=Tanvi|last2=Ritchie|first2=Felix|last3=Welpton|first3=Richard|year=2016|title=Five Safes: designing data access for research|url=http://www2.uwe.ac.uk/faculties/BBS/Documents/1601.pdf|journal=Bristol Business School Working Papers in Economics|volume=|pages=Footnote 1|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/be4aa82cd8cf7f07ca2570d60018da27/e4d483bab4e1ad93ca257f4c00170bb6!OpenDocument|title=1015.0 - Information Paper: Transforming Statistics for the Future|last=|first=|date=2016|website=www.abs.gov.au|publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
|Safe data
|Is there a disclosure risk in the data itself?
|-
|Safe outputs
|Are the statistical results non-disclosive?
|}
These dimensions are scales, not limits. That is, solutions can have a mix of more or fewer controls in each dimension, but the overall solution is 'safe' independent of the particular mix. For example, a public use file available for open download cannot control who uses it, where or for what purpose, and so all the control (protection) must be in the data itself. In contrast, a file which is only accessed through a secure environment with certified users can contain very sensitive information: the non-statistical controls allow the data to be 'unsafe'. One academic likened the process to a graphic equalizer,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McEachern|first=Steve|year=2015|title=Implementation of the Trusted Access Model|url=http://rsss.anu.edu.au/sites/default/files/SMcEachern_researcherperspective_ASSANov2015.pdf|journal=Australian Data Archive|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where bass and treble can be combined independently to produce a sound the listener likes.

The Five Safes concept is associated with other topics which developed from the same programme at ONS, although these are not necessarily implemented. Safe people is associated with 'active researcher management',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unece.org/stats/documents/ece/ces/ge.46/2009/wp.15.e.pdf|title=Effective Researcher Management|last=Desai|first=Tanvi|last2=Ritchie|first2=Felix|date=2009|website=www.unece.org|publisher=Eurostat|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; while safe outputs is linked with [[principles-based output statistical disclosure control]]. The Five Safes is associated with the 'Data Access Spectrum': as the non-data controls tend to work together, these are contrasted with data detail reduction to present a linear representation of data access options.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gcoe.ier.hit-u.ac.jp/CAED/papers/id213_Ritchie.pdf |title=Designing a national model for data access|last=Ritchie|first=Felix|date=2008|work=Comparative Analysis of Enterprise (Micro)Data 2008 |access-date=11 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and terminology ==
The Five Safes was devised in the winter of 2002/2003 by Felix Ritchie at the UK [[Office for National Statistics]] (ONS) to describe its secure remote-access Virtual Microdata Laboratory (VML).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ritchie|first=Felix|year=2008|title=Secure access to confidential microdata: four years of the Virtual Microdata Laboratory|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/elmr/economic-and-labour-market-review/no--5--may-2008/secure-access-to-confidential-microdata--four-years-of-the-virtual-microdata-laboratory.pdf|journal=Economic and Labour Market Statistics|volume=2:5|pages=29–34|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was described at this time as the 'VML Security Model'. This was adopted by the [[NORC at the University of Chicago|NORC]] data enclave,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lane|first=Julia|authorlink=Julia Lane|last2=Bowie|first2=Chet|last3=Scheuren|first3=Fritz|last4=Mulcahy|first4=Tim|year=2009|title=NORC Data Enclave:Providing Secure Remote Access to Sensitive Microdata|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/1001617/4398365/S02P1-NORC-DATA-ENCLAVE-SCHEUREN.ppt|journal=UNECE/EU Workshop on statistical confidentiality 2009|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more widely in the US, as the 'portfolio model' (although this is now also used to refer to a slightly different legal/statistical/educational breakdown).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lane|first=Julia|last2=Heus|first2=Pascal|last3=Mulcahy|first3=Tim|year=2008|title=Data Access in a Cyber World: Making Use of Cyberinfrastructure|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ce88/76858c14560afd6d8bd3e8bcae8425d33cab.pdf|journal=Transactions in Data Privacy|volume=|pages=2–16|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 the framework as was still being referred to as the 'VML security model',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Felix|first=Ritchie,|date=2013-01-01|title=International access to restricted data: A principles-based standards approach|url=http://www.medra.org/servlet/aliasResolver?alias=iospress&amp;genre=article&amp;issn=1874-7655&amp;volume=29&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=289&amp;doi=10.3233/SJI-130780|journal=Statistical Journal of the IAOS|language=en|volume=29|issue=4|doi=10.3233/sji-130780|issn=1874-7655}}&lt;/ref&gt; but its increasing use among non-UK organisations led to the adoption of the more general and informative phrase 'Five Safes'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The original framework only had four safes (projects, people, settings and outputs): the framework was used to describe highly detailed data access through a secure environment, and so the 'data' dimension was irrelevant. From 2007 onwards, 'safe data' was included as the framework was used to a describe a wider range of ONS activities. As the US version was based upon the 2005 specification, some US iterations uses have the original four dimensions (eg&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;).

Some discussions, such as the OECD,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/std/microdata-access-final-report-OECD-2014.pdf|title=OECD Expert Group For International Collaboration On Microdata Access,  Chapter 6. Standardised Application Process For Microdata Access|last=Volkow|first=Natalia|date=|website=www.oecd.org|publisher=OECD|pages=73–79|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; use the term 'secure' instead 'safe'.

== Application ==
The framework has had three uses: pedagogical, descriptive, and design. The latter is a relatively recent development.

=== Pedagogy ===
The first significant use of the framework, other than internal administrative use, was to structure researcher training courses at the UK Office for National Statistics from 2003. [[UK Data Archive]], [[Administrative Data Research Network]], [[Eurostat]], [[Statistics New Zealand]], the Mexican [[National Institute of Statistics and Geography (Mexico)|National Institute of Statistics and Geography]], [[NORC at the University of Chicago|NORC]] and the [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]], amongst others, have also used this framework. Most of these courses are for researchers using restricted-access facilities; the Eurostat courses&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/microdata/overview/self-study-material-for-microdata-users|title=Self-study material for the users of European microdatasets|last=|first=|date=|website=ec.europa.eu|publisher=European Commission|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; are unusual in that they are designed for all users of sensitive data.

=== Description ===
The framework is often used to describe existing data access solutions (e.g. UK [[HM Revenue and Customs|HMRC]] Data Lab,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.slideserve.com/stephen-hester/the-hmrc-datalab|title=The HMRC Datalab|last=Hawkins|first=Mike|date=2011|website=slideserve.com|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; UK Data Service,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Statistics New Zealand&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/stats/documents/ece/ces/ge.46/2013/Topic_3_NZ.pdf|title=Confidentiality for integrated data|last=Camden|first=Mike|date=2011|website=www.unece.org|publisher=Eurostat|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;) or planned/conceptualised ones (e.g. Eurostat in 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/stats/documents/ece/ces/ge.46/2011/43_Eurostat.pdf|title=The Future of Access to European Confidential Data for Scientific Purposes|last=Bujnowska|first=Aleksandra|last2=Museux|first2=Jean-Marc|date=2011|website=www.unece.org|publisher=Eurostat|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;). An early use&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ritchie|first=Felix|year=2005|title=Access to business microdata in the UK: dealing with the irreducible risks|url=http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/stats/documents/ece/ces/ge.46/2005/wp.29.e.pdf|journal=UNECE/Eurostat Workshop on Statistical Data Confidentiality 2005|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was to help identify areas where ONS' still had 'irrreducible risks' in its provision of secure remote access.

The framework is mostly used for confidential social science data. To date it appears to have made little impact on medical research planning,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Green|first=Elizabeth|year=2015|others=et al|title=Enabling data linkage to maximise the value of public health research data|url=http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/stellent/groups/corporatesite/@policy_communications/documents/web_document/wtp059017.pdf|journal=Public Health Research Data Forum Commissioned Reports|publisher=Wellcome Trust|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it is now included in the revised guidelines on implementing [[HIPAA]] regulations&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=18614|title=Proposed Revisions to the Common Rule for the Protection of Human Subjects in the Behavioral and Social Sciences|last=Council|first=National Research|date=2014-01-09|isbn=9780309298063|language=en|doi=10.17226/18614}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the US, and by Cancer Research UK and the [[Health Foundation]] in the UK.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/media/604145/19_5safes_safesettings_wolters.pdf|title=Governance and the HSCIC's IG toolkit|last=Wolters|first=Arne|date=2015|website=ukdataservice.ac.uk|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been used to describe a security model for the Scottish Health Informatics Programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rss.org.uk/uploadedfiles/userfiles/files/Frank-Sullivan-linkage.ppt|title=The Scottish Health Informatics Programme|last=Sullivan|first=Frank|date=|website=www.rss.org.uk|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Design ===
In general the Five Safes has been used to describe solutions post-factum, and to explain/justify choices made, but an increasing number of organisations have used the framework to design data access solutions. For example, the Hellenic Statistical Agency developed a data strategy built around the Five Safes in 2016; the UK Health Foundation used the Five Safes to design its data management and training programmes.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The major design use is in Australia: both the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the Australian Department of Social Service used the Five Safes as an ex ante design tool.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://eprints.uwe.ac.uk/31874/|title=Department of Social Services data access project final report. Project Report |last=Green |first=Elizabeth |date=2016|work=|access-date=|last2=Ritchie|first2=Felix}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2017 the Australian Productivity Commission recommended&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.pc.gov.au/inquiries/completed/data-access/report|title=Data Availability and Use: Australian Productivity Commission Inquiry Report|last=|first=|publisher=Productivity Commission |year=2017|isbn=978-1-74037-617-4|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; adopting a version of the framework to support cross-government data sharing and re-use.

In 2015 the UK Data Service organized a workshop&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ukdataservice.ac.uk/news-and-events/eventsitem/?id=4058|title=The 5 safes of access to confidential data |last=|first=|date=|website=www.ukdataservice.ac.uk|publisher=UK Data Service|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; to encourage data users from the academic and private sectors to think about how to manage confidential research data, using the Five Safes to demonstrate alternative options and best practice.

Two laws have incorporated the Fives Safes: explicitly in the South Australian [https://www.legislation.sa.gov.au/LZ/C/A/PUBLIC%20SECTOR%20(DATA%20SHARING)%20ACT%202016.aspx Public Sector (Data Sharing) Act 2016], implicitly in the research provisions of the [[Digital Economy Act 2017|Digital Economy Act]].

== Public engagement ==
The UK Data Service has produced a blog&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.ukdataservice.ac.uk/access-to-sensitive-data-for-research-the-5-safes/|title=Access to sensitive data for research: the five safes|last=Welpton|first=Richard|last2=Corti|first2=Louise|date=|website=blog.ukdataservice.ac.ukpublisher=UK Data Service|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and video&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mln9T52mwj0|title=Five Safes video|last=|first=|date=|website=www.youtube.com|publisher=UK Data Service|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the general public about the use of Five Safes in re-using administrative data.

'''Fossil fuel phase out''' refers to the discontinuation of the use of [[fossil fuels]], through the decommissioning of operating [[Fossil-fuel power station|fossil fuel-fired power plants]], the prevention of the construction of new ones, and the use of [[alternative energy]] to replace the role of fossil fuels.

The purpose of fossil fuel phase-out is to reduce the negative [[externalities]] that use of fossil fuels cause. Negative externalities refer to the costs a certain activity has over people who did not choose to incur in them. A direct negative externality from fossil fuels' use is [[air pollution]], and an indirect negative externality are [[mining accidents]], that happen as a consequence of the extraction of fossil fuels. Fossil fuel burning contributes to [[climate change]], as it releases [[greenhouse gas emissions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/contents.html|title=IPCC Fourth Assessment Report: Climate Change 2007|last=Solomon, S., D.

=== Coal ===
[[File:Top 5 Coal Consumers.png|thumb|Coal consumption trends 1980–2012 in the top five coal-consuming countries ([[Energy Information Administration|US EIA]])]]

Coal is one of the largest sources of energy, supplying 28.6% percent of the world's primary energy in 2014 (equivalent to 3,917&amp;nbsp;[[Tonne of oil equivalent|Mtoe]]) according to the [[International Energy Agency]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/KeyWorld2016.pdf|title=Key World Energy Statistics|date=2016|website=International Energy Agency|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coal combustion accounted for 14,863&amp;nbsp;Mt of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions in 2014, which is equivalent to a 45.9% of fossil fuel emissions from combustion (excluding non-energy emissions).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

To decrease carbon emissions and thus possibly stop extreme climate change, some have called for coal to be phased out.&lt;ref&gt;Kharecha, P.A., and J.E.

Hansen said "We need a moratorium on coal now...with phase-out of existing plants over the next two decades."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/23/world/europe/23coal.html?_r=2&amp;hp=&amp;pagewanted=print&amp;oref=slogin|title=Europe Turns Back to Coal, Raising Climate Fears|last=Rosenthal|first=Elizabeth|date=23 April 2008|work=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|quote=“We need a moratorium on coal now,” he added, “with phase-out of existing plants over the next two decades.”|accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a study published in [[Science (journal)|Science]] in 2017, coal has to be phased-out globally by about 2030, if the agreed 2&amp;nbsp;°C target is taken seriously.&lt;ref&gt;[[Johan Rockström]] et al.: ''A roadmap for rapid decarbonization''. In: Science. 355, 6331, 2017, pp. 1269–1271, {{DOI|10.1126/science.aah3443}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some nations have decreased their coal consumption thus far in the 21st century, the greatest reductions being in the United States (coal consumption reduced by 176 million metric tons per year over the period 2000–2012), Canada (reduced by 21 million tons per year) and Spain (20 million tons per year). Other nations have increased their coal consumption in the same period, led by China (increased 2,263 million metric tons per year in the period 2000–2012), India (increased 367 million tons per year), and South Korea (59 million tons per year). Worldwide, coal consumption increased 60% during the period 2000–2012.&lt;ref&gt;US Energy Information Administration, [http://www.eia.gov/cfapps/ipdbproject/IEDIndex3.cfm?tid=1&amp;pid=1&amp;aid=2 International statistics: coal consumption], 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2012, 1200 new coal power plants were reportedly being planned worldwide, most of them in China and India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Damian | last=Carrington | url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/nov/20/coal-plants-world-resources-institute | title=More than 1,000 new coal plants being planned | newspaper=The Guardian, | date=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2011–2013 period, the [[OECD]] group of Western European countries has increased the use of coal, attributed largely to the low cost of coal and the high price of imported natural gas in Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher=US EIA | url=http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail/2013-09-27/multiple-factors-push-western-europe-use-less-natural-gas-and-more | title=Multiple factors push Western Europe to use less natural gas and more coal | date=27 September 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927150527/http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail/2013-09-27/multiple-factors-push-western-europe-use-less-natural-gas-and-more | archivedate=27 September 2013 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, coal consumption has peaked in China in 2013 or 2014, depending on the data used and fell in 2015 by 3.6%, even though there was a growth of GDP of 6.9%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Qi | first1 = Ye | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2016 | title = China's post-coal growth | url = | journal = [[Nature Geoscience]] | volume =  9| issue = | pages =  564–566| doi = 10.1038/ngeo2777 | bibcode = 2016NatGe...9..564Q}}&lt;/ref&gt; After smaller increases, consumption remained below the prior peak by 2017.&lt;ref&gt;Qi Ye, Jiaqi Lu ([[Brookings Institute]]): China's coal comsumption has peaked[https://www.brookings.edu/2018/01/22/chinas-coal-consumption-has-peaked/], 20.

According to [[Scientific American]], the average coal plant emits more than 100 times as much radiation per year than does a comparatively sized nuclear power plant, in the form of fly ash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=coal-ash-is-more-radioactive-than-nuclear-waste|title=Coal Ash Is More Radioactive than Nuclear Waste: By burning away all the pesky carbon and other impurities, coal power plants produce heaps of radiation|date=2009-05-18|accessdate=2009-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some like the "coal advisory board" of the IEA believe that coal should not be phased out, considering that longer-term global economic growth cannot be achieved without adequate and affordable energy supplies, which will require continuing significant contributions from fossil fuels including coal. In this viewpoint, [[clean coal technology]] could reduce [[greenhouse gas]] emissions compatible with a low-emissions future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iea.org/ciab/papers/ciab.pdf|title=Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions - The Potential of Coal|website=Coal Industry Advisory Board/International Energy Agency|publisher=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development/International Energy Agency|accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some environmentalists and climatologists support a phase-out and criticise clean coal as not a solution to [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/5975|title=Clean Coal: Wave of the Future or Empty Rhetoric?|website=Worldwatch Institute|publisher=Worldwatch Institute|accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entrepreneurs promote improved regulations and modernised technology.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Sometimes coal is replaced by natural gas, which has lower carbon emissions and produces less pollutants. However natural gas is also a fossil fuel, so a switch from coal to natural gas does not contribute to a fossil fuel phase-out.

{{As of|October 2018}}, 28 national governments, 19 sub-national governments and 28 organisations&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://poweringpastcoal.org/about/Powering_Past_Coal_Alliance_Members|title=Powering Past Coal Alliance members list|last=|first=|date=|website=poweringpastcoal.org|access-date=20 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; had become members of the [[Powering Past Coal Alliance]], each making a declaration to advance the transition away from unabated coal power generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://poweringpastcoal.org/about/Powering_Past_Coal_Alliance_Declaration|title=Powering Past Coal Alliance declaration|last=|first=|date=|website=poweringpastcoal.org|access-date=20 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Oil ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
Oil is refined into [[fuel oil]], [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] and [[gasoline]]. The refined products are primarily for transportation by conventional cars, trucks, trains, planes and ships.  Popular alternatives are [[human-powered transport]], [[public transport]], [[electric vehicles]], and [[biofuels]].

=== Natural gas ===
{{Main|Natural gas}}
Although natural gas has about half the carbon intensity of coal it is also the single largest source of [[atmospheric methane]] in the United States. It is seen by many as a temporary "bridge fuel" to replace coal, but in turn to be replaced by renewable sources. However this "bridge fuel" is likely to  significantly extend the use of fossil fuel as the average plant life is 35 years.&lt;ref&gt;https://energycenter.org/sites/default/files/docs/nav/policy/research-and-reports/Natural_Gas_Bridge_Fuel.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Gas consumption has tripled since 1971, and by 2015 it was generating half as much electricity as coal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/KeyNaturalGasTrends.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417225701/https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/KeyNaturalGasTrends.pdf|title=Key natural gas trends|year=2015|archive-date=2016-04-17|website=www.iea.org|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the consumption of gas is expected to grow an additional 10% by 2040, the phase out is likely to be many years in the future.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.iea.org/topics/naturalgas/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basis ==
The basis of phasing-out fossil fuels consists mainly of the projected lower cost of renewable sources of energy,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irena.org/publications/2018/Jan/Renewable-power-generation-costs-in-2017&lt;/ref&gt; but the avoidance of risks in health and [[mitigation of global warming]] are also important considerations.

=== Health ===
Using computer modeling he developed over 20 years, [[Mark Z. Jacobson]] has found that [[carbon]]aceous fuel [[particulate matter|soot emissions]] (which lead to respiratory illness, heart disease, and asthma) have resulted in 1.5 million premature deaths each year, mostly in the developing world where the non-fossil fuels wood and animal dung are used for cooking. Jacobson has also said that soot from diesel engines, coal-fired power plants, and burning wood is a "bigger cause of global warming than previously thought, and is the major cause of the rapid melting of the Arctic's sea ice".&lt;ref name="dp"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Scientists-say-soot-a-key-factor-in-warming-3180603.php#ixzz0v1KwN5yZ | title=Scientists say soot a key factor in warming | work=SFGate | date=28 July 2010 | accessdate=19 July 2016 | author=Perlman, David}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, new evidence has emerged that there are considerable risks associated with traditional energy sources, and that major changes to the mix of energy technologies are needed:

{{Block quote|Several mining tragedies globally have underscored the human toll of the coal supply chain. New EPA initiatives targeting air toxics, coal ash, and effluent releases highlight the environmental impacts of coal and the cost of addressing them with control technologies. The use of fracking in natural gas exploration is coming under scrutiny, with evidence of groundwater contamination and greenhouse gas emissions. Concerns are increasing about the vast amounts of water used at coal-fired plants, particularly in regions of the country facing water shortages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.civilsocietyinstitute.org/media/pdfs/Toward%20a%20Sustainable%20Future%2011-16-11.pdf |title=Toward a Sustainable Future for the U.S. Power Sector: Beyond Business as Usual 2011 |author=Synapse Energy Economics |date=16 November 2011 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Global warming mitigation ===
{{See|Global warming}}In 2008, [[James E. Hansen|James Hansen]] and nine other scientists published a journal article titled "Target atmospheric {{co2}}: Where should humanity aim?" which calls for a complete phase-out of coal power by 2030.&lt;ref name="hansen-etal-2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last2=Sato |first2=Makiko| last3=Kharecha |first3=Pushker| last4=Beerling|first4=David|last5=Berner|first5=Robert|last6=Masson-Delmotte|first6=Valerie|authorlink6=Valerie Masson-Delmotte | last7=Pagani |first7=Mark | last8=Raymo | first8=Maureen| last9=Royer | first9=Dana L | date=31 October 2008 | title=Target atmospheric {{co2}}: Where should humanity aim?|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~jeh1/2008/TargetCO2_20080407.pdf|journal=The Open Atmospheric Science Journal|volume=2|pages=217–231|arxiv=0804.1126|bibcode=2008OASJ....2..217H|doi=10.2174/1874282300802010217|access-date=2016-10-31|first1=James|last1=Hansen|first10=James C|last10=Zachos}} 
&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, Hansen has stated that continued [[opposition to nuclear power]] threatens humanity's ability to avoid dangerous climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/11/03/world/nuclear-energy-climate-change-scientists-letter/|title=Top climate change scientists issue open letter to policy influencers - CNN.com|date=3 November 2013|author=By|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; The letter, co-authored with other climate change experts declared "If we stay on the current path," he said, "those are the consequences we'll be leaving to our children. The best candidate to avoid that is nuclear power. It's ready now. We need to take advantage of it." and "Continued opposition to nuclear power threatens humanity's ability to avoid dangerous climate change."

Also in 2008, Pushker Kharecha and James Hansen published a peer-reviewed scientific study analyzing the effect of a coal phase-out on atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2008|title=Implications of "peak oil" for atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and climate|url=http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/abstracts/2008/Kharecha_Hansen.html|journal=Global Biogeochem. Cycles|volume=22|issue=3|pages=GB3012|arxiv=0704.2782|bibcode=2008GBioC..22.3012K|doi=10.1029/2007GB003142|author1=Kharecha, P.A.|author2=J.E. Hansen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their baseline mitigation scenario was a phaseout of global coal emissions by 2050. The authors describe the scenario as follows:

{{quote|The second scenario, labeled Coal Phase-out, is meant to approximate a situation in which developed countries freeze their CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from coal by 2012 and a decade later developing countries similarly halt increases in coal emissions.  Between 2025 and 2050 it is assumed that both developed and developing countries will linearly phase out emissions of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from coal usage.  Thus in Coal Phase-out we have global CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from coal increasing 2% per year until 2012, 1% per year growth of coal emissions between 2013 and 2022, flat coal emissions for 2023–2025, and finally a linear decrease to zero CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from coal in 2050.  These rates refer to emissions to the atmosphere and do not constrain consumption of coal, provided the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is captured and sequestered. Oil and gas emissions are assumed to be the same as in the BAU [business as usual] scenario.}}

Kharecha and Hansen also consider three other mitigation scenarios, all with the same coal phase-out schedule but each making different assumptions about the size of oil and gas reserves and the speed at which they are depleted. Under the Business as Usual scenario, atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; peaks at 563 parts per million (ppm) in the year 2100. Under the four coal phase-out scenarios, atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; peaks at 422-446 ppm between 2045 and 2060 and declines thereafter. The key implications of the study are as follows: a phase-out of coal emissions is the most important remedy for mitigating human-induced global warming; actions should be taken toward limiting or stretching out the use of conventional oil and gas; and strict emissions-based constraints are needed for future use of unconventional fossil fuels such as [[methane hydrates]] and [[tar sands]].

In December 2015, [[Greenpeace]] and [[Climate Action Network|Climate Action Network Europe]] released a report highlighting the need for an active phase-out of coal-fired generation across Europe.  Their analysis derived from a database of 280 coal plants and included emissions data from official EU registries.&lt;ref name="jones-and-gutmann-2015"&gt;

A September 2016 report by Oil Change International, concludes that the carbon emissions embedded in the coal, oil, and gas in currently working mines and fields, assuming that these run to the end of their working lifetimes, will take the world to just beyond the 2{{nnbsp}}°C limit contained in the 2015 [[Paris Agreement]] and even further from the 1.5{{nnbsp}}°C goal.&lt;ref name="mathiesen-2016"&gt;

In October 2016, the [[Overseas Development Institute]] (ODI) and 11 other [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]s released a report on the impact of building new coal-fired power plants in countries where a significant proportion of the population lacks access to electricity.  The report concludes that, on the whole, building coal-fired power plants does little to help the poor and may make them poorer.  Moreover, wind and solar generation are beginning to challenge coal on cost.&lt;ref name="nuccitelli-2016"&gt;

A 2018 study in Nature Energy, suggests that 10 countries in Europe could completely phase out coal-fired electricity generation with their current infrastructure, whilst the United States and Russia could phase out at least 30%.&lt;ref name="wilson-and-staffell-2018"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Challenges of fossil fuel phase-out ==
The phase-out of fossil fuels involves many challenges, and one of them is the reliance that currently the world has on them. In 2014, fossil fuels provided 81.1% of the [[primary energy consumption]] of the world, with approximately 11,109&amp;nbsp;Mtoe. This number is composed by 4,287&amp;nbsp;Mtoe of oil consumption; 3,918&amp;nbsp;Mtoe of coal consumption, and 2,904&amp;nbsp;Mtoe of natural gas consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/KeyWorld2016.pdf|title=Key World Energy Statistics|last=|first=|date=2016|website=International Energy Agency|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fossil fuel phase-out can lead to an increment in electricity prices, because of the new investments needed to replace their share in the electricity mix with alternative energy sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Green|first=R|last2=Staffell|first2=I|date=2016|title=Electricity in Europe: exiting fossil fuels?|url=https://academic.oup.com/oxrep/article-pdf/32/2/282/7298756/grw003.pdf|journal=Oxford Review of Economic Policy|volume=32|issue=2|pages=282-303|doi=10.1093/oxrep/grw003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another cause to increasing electricity price comes from the need to import the electricity that can't be generated nationally.&lt;ref&gt;Yilmaz, H. Ü., Bchini, Q., Keles, D., Hartel, R., Fichtner, W., Mikulić, M., &amp; Jakšić, D. (2016). Impacts of a UK and German coal phase-out on the electricity mix and CO 2 emissions in Europe. ''Insight Energy'', (April).

Another impact of a phase-out of fossil fuels is in the employment. In the case of employments in the fossil fuel industry, a phase-out is logically undesired, therefore, people in the industry will usually oppose any measures that put their industries under scrutiny.&lt;ref name="Heinrichs 285–305"/&gt; Endre Tvinnereim and Elisabeth Ivarsflaten studied the relationship between employment in the fossil fuel industry with the support to climate change policies. They proposed that one opportunity for displaced drilling employments in the fossil fuel industry could be in the geothermal energy industry. This was suggested as a result of their conclusion: people and companies in the fossil fuel industry will likely oppose measures that endanger their employments, unless they have other stronger alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tvinnereim|first=Endre|last2=Ivarsflaten|first2=Elisabeth|date=2016-09-01|title=Fossil fuels, employment, and support for climate policies|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421516302828|journal=Energy Policy|volume=96|pages=364–371|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2016.05.052}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be extrapolated to political interests, that can push against the phase-out of fossil fuels initiative. One example is how the vote of [[United Stats|US]] Congress members is related to the preeminence of fossil fuel industries in their respective states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cragg|first=Michael I.|last2=Zhou|first2=Yuyu|last3=Gurney|first3=Kevin|last4=Kahn|first4=Matthew E.|date=2013-04-01|title=Carbon Geography: The Political Economy of Congressional Support for Legislation Intended to Mitigate Greenhouse Gas Production|ssrn=2225690}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legislation and initiatives to phase out coal ==

=== Major economies ===
In 8 June 2015, several newspapers ran an article wrote that the leaders of the [[Group of Seven]] (or G7, consisting of [[Canada]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]]) agreed to phase-out fossil fuel use by 2100,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/08/g7-leaders-agree-phase-out-fossil-fuel-use-end-of-century|title=G7 leaders agree to phase out fossil fuel use by end of century|last=Connolly|first=Kate|date=2015-06-08|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-04-30|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/ec2c365a-0ddf-11e5-aa7b-00144feabdc0|title=G7 leaders agree to phase out fossil fuels|last=Clark|first=Pilita|date=8 June 2015|work=Financial Times|access-date=|last2=Wagstyl|first2=Stefan|month=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the efforts to keep global temperature increase under 2°C. This was done as a prelude for the United Nations Climate Change Conference (a.k.a. [[COP 21]]) hosted in Paris, on December of the same year.

=== Australia ===
[[File:Graph RE Australia 2010.svg|thumb|Electricity generation from renewable sources in Australia in 2010]]

The [[Australian Greens]] party have proposed to phase out coal power stations. The NSW Greens proposed an immediate moratorium on coal-fired power stations and want to end all coal mining and [[coal industry subsidies]].  The Australian Greens and the [[Australian Labor Party]] also oppose nuclear power.  The Federal Government and Victorian State Government want to modify existing coal-fired power stations into clean coal power stations.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} The Federal Labor government extended the [[Mandatory Renewable Energy Target#Australia|mandatory renewable energy target]]s, an initiative to ensure that new sources of electricity are more likely to be from wind power, solar power and other sources of [[renewable energy in Australia]].  [[Australia]] is one of the largest consumers of coal per capita, and also the largest exporter. The proposals are strongly opposed by industry, unions&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.australian-options.org.au/issues/options_53/article_colley.php Australian Options Magazine, CFMEU on coal phase out] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320100225/http://www.australian-options.org.au/issues/options_53/article_colley.php |date=20 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the main Opposition Party in Parliament (now forming the party in government after the September 2013 election).

=== Canada ===
In 2005, Canada annually burned 60 million tons of coal, mainly for electrical power, increasing by 15 percent annually.

In November 2016, Canada announced plans to phase-out coal-fired electricity generation by 2030.&lt;ref name="the-guardian-2016"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 2005, [[Ontario]], [[Canada]] planned coal phase-out legislation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20050216005791/en/Ontarios-Coal-Phase-out-Drastic-Consequences-Thinking-Companies#.Uv-cnP0-vCE Ontario's Coal Phase-out Will Have Drastic Consequences, Say The Thinking Companies]. 16 February 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Ontario annually consumed 15 million tons of coal in large power plants to supplement nuclear power. [[Nanticoke Generating Station]] was a major source of air pollution, and Ontario suffered "smog days" during the summer.{{citation needed|date = February 2014}}
In 2007, Ontario's Liberal government committed to phasing out all coal generation in the province by 2014. Premier Dalton McGuinty said, "By 2030 there will be about 1,000 more new coal-fired generating stations built on this planet. There is only one place in the world that is phasing out coal-fired generation and we're doing that right here in Ontario."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20070618/ont_coal_plants_070618/20070618 |title=Ont.

=== China ===
There are currently no plans to phase out coal burning power stations in the [[People's Republic of China]] on the national level.

China's exceedingly high energy demand has pushed the demand for relatively cheap coal-fired power. Each week, another 2&amp;nbsp;GW of coal-fired power is put online in China.  Coal supplies about 80% of China's energy needs today, and that ratio is expected to continue, even as overall power usage grows rapidly. Serious air quality deterioration has resulted from the massive use of coal and many Chinese cities suffer severe smog events.{{citation needed|date=May 2010}}

As a consequence the region of Beijing has decided to phase out all its coal-fired power generation by the end of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.platts.com/latest-news/electric-power/singapore/chinas-beijing-city-to-abolish-coal-fired-power-27490804|title=China's Beijing city to abolish coal-fired power plants by end 2014 - Electric Power - Platts News Article &amp; Story|website=www.platts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Update inline|date=November 2016}}

In 2009, China had 172&amp;nbsp;GW of installed hydro capacity the largest in the world, producing 16% of China's electricity, the Eleventh Five-Year Plan has set a 300&amp;nbsp;GW target for 2020. China built the world's largest power plant of any kind, the [[Three Gorges Dam]].

In July 2014, [[Climate Action Network|CAN Europe]], [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF European Policy Office]], HEAL, [[European Environmental Bureau|EEB]] and [[Climate-Alliance Germany]] published a report calling for the decommissioning of the thirty most polluting coal-fired power plants in Europe.&lt;ref name="gutmann-etal-2014"&gt;

[[Hard coal]] mining has long been subsidized in Germany, reaching a peak of €6.7{{nbsp}}billion in 1996 and dropping to €2.7{{nbsp}}billion in 2005 due to falling output.  These subsidies represent a burden on public finances and imply a substantial [[opportunity cost]], diverting funds away from other, more beneficial public investments.&lt;ref name="frondel-etal-2007"&gt;

Coal is still the largest source of power in Germany.

In 2007, [[Chancellor of Germany|German Chancellor]] [[Angela Merkel]] and her party agreed to legislation to phase out Germany's hard coal mining sector. That does not mean that they support phasing out coal in general. There were plans to build about 25 new plants in the coming years. Most German coal power plants were built in the 1960s, and have a low energy efficiency. Public sentiment against coal power plants is growing and the construction or planning of some plants has been stopped.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"/&gt; A number are under construction and still being built. No concrete plan is in place to reduce coal-fired electricity generation. As of October 2015, the remaining coal plants still under planning include: Niederaussem, Profen, and Stade. The coal plants currently under construction include: Mannheim, Hamm D, Datteln, and Willhelmshaven. Between 2012 and 2015, six new plants went online. All of these plants are 600–1800&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;[[Megawatt|MW]]&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energytransition.de/2015/10/the-demise-of-coal-in-germany-and-globally/|title=The demise of coal in Germany and globally|date=15 October 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Germany's coal consumption dropped for the first time, having risen each year since the low during the 2009 recession.&lt;ref name="bp-statistical-review-2015"&gt;

A 2014 study, found that coal is not making a comeback in Germany, as is sometimes claimed.  Rather renewables have more than offset the nuclear facilities that have been shutdown as a result of Germany's [[Nuclear power phase-out#Germany|nuclear phase-out]] (''Atomausstieg'').  Hard coal plants now face financial stringency as their operating hours are cut back by the market.  But in contrast, [[lignite]]-fired generation is in a safe position until the {{nowrap|mid-2020s}} unless government policies change.  To phase-out coal, Germany should seek to strength the emissions trading system ([[European Union Emission Trading Scheme|EU-ETS]]), consider a carbon tax, promote [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], and strengthen the use of natural gas as a bridge fuel.&lt;ref name="jungjohann-and-morris-2014"&gt;

In 2016, the German government and affected [[lignite]] power plant operators [[:de:Mitteldeutsche Braunkohlengesellschaft|Mibrag]], [[RWE]], and [[Vattenfall]] reached an understanding (''Verständigung'') on the transfer of lignite power plant units into security standby (''Überführung von Braunkohlekraftwerksblöcken in die Sicherheitsbereitschaft'').  As a result, eight lignite-fired power plants are to be mothballed and later closed, with the first plant scheduled to cease operation in October 2016 and the last in October 2019.  The affected operators will receive state compensation for foregone profits.  The [[European Commission]] has declared government plans to use €1.6{{nbsp}}billion of public financing for this purpose to be in line with EU [[state aid]] rules.&lt;ref name="german-energy-blog-2016"&gt;

A 2016 study, found that the phase-out of lignite in [[Lusatia]] (''Lausitz'') by 2030 can be financed by future owner [[Energetický a průmyslový holding|EPH]] in a manner that avoids taxpayer involvement.  Instead, liabilities covering decommissioning and land rehabilitation could be paid by EPH directly into a foundation, perhaps run by the public company [[:de:Lausitzer und Mitteldeutsche Bergbau-Verwaltungsgesellschaft|LMBV]].  The study calculates the necessary provisions at €2.6{{nbsp}}billion.&lt;ref name="ieefa-2016"&gt;

Plans to cut down the ancient [[Hambach Forest]] to extend the [[Hambach open pit mine]] in 2018 have resulted in massive protests. On 5 Oct, 2018 a German court ruled against the further destruction of the forest for mining purposes. The ruling states, the court needs more time to reconsider the complaint. Angela Merkel, the chancellor of Germany, welcomed the court's ruling. The forest is located approximately 29 km km west of the city center of Cologne (specifically Cologne Cathedral).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/10/05/europe/germany-hambach-forest-court-intl/index.html|title=Hambach Forest clearance halted by German court|last=CNN|first=Laura Smith-Spark,|work=CNN|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== South Africa ===
As of 2007, South Africa's power sector is the 8th highest global emitter of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/11/071114163448.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005/2006, 77% of South Africa's energy demand was directly met by coal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dme.gov.za/energy/coal.stm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091202053007/http://www.dme.gov.za/energy/coal.stm |archivedate=2 December 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and when current projects come online, this ratio will increase in the near term.

There are no plans to phase out coal-fired power plants in South Africa, and indeed, the country is investing in building massive amounts of new coal-fired capacity to meet power demands, as well as modernizing the existing coal-fired plants to meet environmental requirements.

On April 6, 2010, the World Bank approved a $3.75B loan to South Africa to support the construction of the world's 4th largest coal-fired plant, at Medupi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/environment/article7088297.ece | work=[[The Times]] | location=London | title=Britain may block World Bank loan for coal plant in South Africa | first=Ben | last=Webster | date=April 6, 2010 | accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The proposed World Bank loan includes a relatively small amount{{snd}} $260 million{{snd}} for wind and solar power.

Rated at 4800&amp;nbsp;GW, [[Medupi Power Station]] would join other mammoth coal-fired power plants already in operation in the country, namely [[Kendal Power Station]] (4100&amp;nbsp;GW), [[Majuba Power Station]] (4100&amp;nbsp;GW), and [[Matimba Power Station]] (4000&amp;nbsp;GW), as well as a similar-capacity [[Kusile Power Station]], at 4800&amp;nbsp;GW, currently under construction.  Kusile is expected to come online in stages, starting in 2012, while Medupi is expected to first come online in 2013, with full capacity available by 2017.  These schedules are provisional, and may change.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Since 2008, South Africa's government started funding [[solar water heating]] installations. As of January 2016, there have been 400 000 domestic installations in total, with free-of-charge installation of low-pressure solar water heaters for low-cost homes or low-income households which have access to the electricity grid, while other installations are subsidised.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ee.co.za/article/solar-water-heater-rollout-programme-gains-momentum.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
[[Ed Miliband]] ([[Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change|energy secretary]] from 3 October 2008{{snd}} 11 May 2010) announced that no new coal-fired power stations will be built in Britain from 2009 onwards unless they capture and bury at least 25% of greenhouse gases immediately and 100% by 2025 although at the time this was a statement of intent rather than something he was able to enforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/apr/23/clean-coal-energy-policy | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=John | last=Vidal | title=Clean coal push marks reversal of UK energy policy | date=April 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chris Huhne]] (energy secretary from 12 May 2010{{snd}} 5 February 2012) has confirmed that the legislation required to allow his office to enforce [[Emission standard#UK|emissions standards]] are proceeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessgreen.com/bg/news/1806551/huhne-promises-coal-plants-ccs |title=Huhne promises no more coal plants without CCS |publisher=BusinessGreen |date=17 Aug 2010 |accessdate=2013-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK is also subject to the EU's [[Large Combustion Plant Directive]] covering non-CO2 emissions which is expected to bring many older plants to a close over the next few years as they are too expensive to upgrade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/quality/industrial/eu-international/lcpd/ |title=Large Combustion Plant Directive « Industrial emissions |publisher=Defra.gov.uk |accessdate=2013-12-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424052427/http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/quality/industrial/eu-international/lcpd/ |archivedate=24 April 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Amber Rudd]] (energy secretary from 11 May 2015) announced on 18 November 2015 that all coal-fired power stations would close by 2025. This will not be a complete phase out of fossil fuels because gas-fired power stations will continue to provide some [[firm power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/energy/12001752/UK-coal-plants-must-close-by-2025-Amber-Rudd-to-announce.html|title=UK coal plants must close by 2025, Amber Rudd announces|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, 154 new coal-fired plants were on the drawing board in 42 states.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/news/2006/10/71952 Eco Concern: Coal Plant Boom] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214223405/http://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/news/2006/10/71952 |date=14 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2012, that had dropped to 15, mostly due to new rules limiting mercury emissions, and limiting carbon emissions to 1,000 pounds of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per megawatt-hour of electricity produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303404704577307524051798192|title=EPA Proposes CO|author=Keith Johnson in Washington, Rebecca Smith in San Francisco and Kris Maher in Pittsburgh|date=28 March 2012|work=WSJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, US Secretary of Energy [[Ernest Moniz]] outlined Obama administration policy on fossil fuels:

{{Block quote|In the last four years, we’ve more than doubled renewable energy generation from wind and solar power.  However, coal and other fossil fuels still provide 80 percent of our energy, 70 percent of our electricity, and will be a major part of our energy future for decades.  That’s why any serious effort to protect our kids from the worst effects of climate change must also include developing, demonstrating and deploying the technologies to use our abundant fossil fuel resources as cleanly as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Moritz, [http://energy.gov/articles/excerpts-energy-secretary-ernest-moniz-s-remarks-national-energy-technology-laboratory Excerpts of Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz’s Remarks at National Energy Technology Laboratory in Morgantown], [[United States Department of Energy]], 29 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Then-US Energy Secretary [[Steven Chu]] and researchers for the US [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] have noted that greater electrical generation by non-[[Dispatchable generation|dispatchable]] renewables, such as wind and solar, will also increase the need for flexible natural gas-powered generators, to supply electricity during those times when solar and wind power are unavailable.&lt;ref&gt;April Lee and others, [http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy13osti/56324.pdf Opportunities for synergy between natural gas and renewable energy], National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Dec. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Funk, [http://www.cleveland.com/business/index.ssf/2012/01/doe_boss_says_shale_gas_could.html DOE boss says shale gas could benefit wind and solar], Cleveland Plain Dealer, 18 Jan. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Gas-powered generators have the ability to ramp up and down quickly to meet changing loads.&lt;ref&gt;US EIA, [http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=13191 Natural gas-fired combustion turbines are generally used to meet peak electricity load], 1 Oct. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, many of the fossil fuel phase-out initiatives have taken place at the state or local levels.

==== California ====
[[California]]'s SB 1368 created the first governmental moratorium on new coal plants in the United States. The law was signed in September 2006 by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energy.ca.gov/emission_standards/index.html |title=SB 1368 Emission Performance Standards |publisher=Energy.ca.gov |accessdate=2013-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; took effect for investor-owned utilities in January 2007, and took effect for publicly owned utilities in August 2007. SB 1368 applied to long-term investments (five years or more) by California utilities, whether in-state or out-of-state. It set the standard for greenhouse gas emissions at 1,100 pounds of carbon dioxide per megawatt-hour, equal to the emissions of a combined-cycle natural gas plant. This standard created a de facto moratorium on new coal, since it could not be met without carbon capture and sequestration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solutionsforglobalwarming.org/docs/SB1368_FS_FINAL.pdf "California Takes on Power Plant Emissions: SB 1368 Sets Groundbreaking Greenhouse Gas Performance Standard,"] [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] Fact Sheet, August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Maine ====
On April 15, 2008, [[Maine]] Governor [[John E. Baldacci]] signed LD 2126, "An Act To Minimize Carbon Dioxide Emissions from New Coal-Powered Industrial and Electrical Generating Facilities in the State." The law, which was sponsored by Rep. W. Bruce MacDonald (D-[[Boothbay, Maine|Boothbay]]), requires the Board of Environmental Protection to develop greenhouse gas emission standards for coal gasification facilities. It also puts a moratorium in place on building any new coal gasification facilities until the standards are developed.&lt;ref&gt;Rhonda Erskine, [http://www.wcsh6.com/news/article.aspx?storyid=84867 "Maine Governor Baldacci Signs Bill to Reduce Carbon Dioxide Emissions,"] [[WCSH]] [[WCSH6]].com, April 15, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Oregon ====
In early March 2016, Oregon lawmakers approved a plan to stop paying for out-of-state coal plants by 2030 and require a 50 percent renewable energy standard by 2040.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/oregon-lawmakers-approve-far-reaching-climate-change-bill/ar-BBqiuvg?ocid=ansmsnnews11|title=Oregon lawmakers approve far-reaching climate change bill|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305215204/http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/oregon-lawmakers-approve-far-reaching-climate-change-bill/ar-BBqiuvg?ocid=ansmsnnews11|archivedate=5 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental groups such as the [[American Wind Energy Association]] and leading Democrats praised the bill.

==== Texas ====
In 2006 a coalition of [[Texas]] groups organized a campaign in favor of a statewide moratorium on new coal-fired power plants. The campaign culminated in a "Stop the Coal Rush" mobilization, including rallying and lobbying, at the state capital in  [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] on February 11 and 12th, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://texas.sierraclub.org/press/newsreleases/20070125.asp "Stop the Coal Rush" Rally &amp; Lobby Day Set for February 11 &amp; 12"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030034206/http://texas.sierraclub.org/press/newsreleases/20070125.asp |date=30 October 2008 }}, [[Sierra Club]] Lone Star Chapter.&lt;/ref&gt; Over 40 citizen groups supported the mobilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stopthecoalrush.com/participating-organizations/ |title=StopTheCoalRush - Hot Rush in Marketing |work=stopthecoalrush.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513110722/http://www.stopthecoalrush.com/participating-organizations/ |archivedate=13 May 2008 |df=dmy }}]&lt;/ref&gt;

In January, 2007, A resolution calling for a 180-day moratorium on new pulverized coal plants was filed in the Texas Legislature by State Rep. [[Charles "Doc" Anderson]] (R-Waco) as House Concurrent Resolution 43.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/80R/billtext/pdf/HC00043I.pdf|title=Text of HCR 43|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution was left pending in committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legis.state.tx.us/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=80R&amp;Bill=HCR43|title=Texas Legislature Online - 80(R) History for HCR 43|work=state.tx.us}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 4, 2007, Rep. Anderson announced his support for two proposed  [[integrated gasification combined cycle]] (IGCC) coal plants proposed by [[Luminant]] (formerly TXU).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.docandersonfortexas.com/news.htm Rep.

==== Washington state ====
[[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] has followed the same approach as California, prohibiting coal plants whose emissions would exceed those of natural gas plants. Substitute Senate Bill 6001 (SSB 6001), signed on May 3, 2007, by Governor [[Christine Gregoire]], enacted the standard.&lt;ref name="whitmanpioneer.com"&gt;Christina Russell, [http://whitmanpioneer.com/outdoors/2007/11/15/wallula-coal-plant-proposal-controversial-among-students-faculty/ "Wallula Coal Plant Proposal Controversial Among Students, Faculty,"] [[Whitman College]] Pioneer, 11/15/07&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of SSB 6001, the [https://web.archive.org/web/20090716184525/http://www.energy-northwest.com/generation/igcc/index.php Pacific Mountain Energy Center] in Kalama was rejected by the state. However, a new plant proposal, the [http://www.wallulaenergy.com/ Wallula Energy Resource Center], shows the limits of the "natural gas equivalency" approach as a means of prohibiting new coal plants. The proposed plant would meet the standard set by SSB 6001 by capturing and sequestering a portion (65 percent, according to a plant spokesman) of its carbon.&lt;ref name="whitmanpioneer.com"/&gt;

=== Japan ===
Japan, the world's third-largest economy, made a major move to use more fossil fuels in 2012, when the nation shut down nuclear reactors following the Fukishima accident. Nuclear, which had supplied 30 percent of Japanese electricity from 1987 to 2011, supplied only 2 percent in 2012 (hydropower supplied 8 percent). Nuclear electricity was replaced with electricity from petroleum, coal, and liquified natural gas. As a result, electricity generation from fossil fuels rose to 90 percent in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=10391  "Japan’s fossil-fueled generation remains high because of continuing nuclear plant outages"], US Energy Information Administration, 15 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, the Japanese government announced plans to build 45 new coal-fired power plants in the next ten years, largely to replace expensive electricity from petroleum power plants.&lt;ref&gt;Babs McHugh, [http://www.platts.com/latest-news/coal/sydney/japan-plans-to-build-45-new-coal-power-plants-27762428 "Japan plans to build 45 coal power plants in next decade,"] Platts, 3 Feb. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Opinion polls ===

==== Opinion research ====
In October 2007, [http://www.civilsocietyinstitute.org/ Civil Society Institute] released the results of a poll of 1,003 US citizens conducted by Opinion Research Corporation.

The authors of the poll reported:
"75 percent of Americans—including 65 percent of Republicans, 83 percent of Democrats and 76 percent of Independents—would 'support a five-year moratorium on new coal-fired power plants in the United States if there was stepped-up investment in clean, safe renewable energy—such as wind and solar—and improved home energy-efficiency standards.' Women (80 percent) were more likely than men (70 percent) to support this idea. Support also was higher among college graduates (78 percent) than among those who did not graduate from high school (68 percent)."&lt;ref&gt;Opinion Research Corporation, [http://www.cleanenergyaction.net/101807_CLEAN_survey_report.pdf A Post Fossil-Fuel America] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201122738/http://www.cleanenergyaction.net/101807_CLEAN_survey_report.pdf |date=1 December 2008 }}, Executive Summary, National Opinion Survey Produced for Citizens Lead for Energy Action Now (CLEAN),
A Project of the Civil Society Institute, 18 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact question posed by the survey was as follows:
"More than half of power plant-generated electricity comes from coal. Experts say that power plants are responsible for about 40 percent of U.S. carbon dioxide pollution linked to global warming. There are plans to build more than 150 new coal-fired power plants over the next several years. Would you support a five-year moratorium on new coal-fired power plants in the United States if there was stepped-up investment in clean, safe and renewable energy—such as wind and solar—and improved home energy-efficiency standards? Would you say definitely yes, probably yes, probably no, definitely no, or don't know."

== Alternative Sources of Energy ==
{{See also|Alternative energy|energy transition|100% renewable energy}}

[[Alternative energy]] refers to any source of energy that can substitute the role of fossil fuels. [[Renewable energy]], or energy that is harnessed from [[Renewable resource|renewable sources]], is an alternative energy. However, alternative energy can refer to non renewable sources as well, like [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]]. Between the alternative sources of energy are: [[solar energy]], [[hydroelectricity]], [[marine energy]], [[Wind power|wind energy]], [[geothermal energy]], [[biofuel]]s, [[ethanol]] and [[Hydrogen economy|Hydrogen]].

[[Efficient energy use|Energy efficiency]] is complementary to the use of alternative energy sources, when phasing-out fossil fuels.

=== Renewable energy ===
[[File:Bp world energy consumption 2016.gif|thumb|The worldwide growth of renewable energy is shown by the green line&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bp.com/statisticalreview Statistical Review of World Energy], Workbook (xlsx), London, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Renewable energy is [[energy]] that comes from resources which are naturally replenished such as [[sunlight]], [[wind]], [[rain]], [[tidal energy|tides]], [[wave power|waves]], and [[geothermal energy|geothermal heat]]. {{As of|2014}}, 19% of global final energy consumption comes from [[renewable resource]]s, with 9% of all energy from traditional [[biomass]], mainly used for [[heating]], 1% from biofuels, 4% from [[hydroelectricity]] and 4% from biomass, geothermal or solar heat. Popular renewables (wind, solar, geothermal and biomass for power) accounted for another 1.4% and are growing rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/REN21_GSR2016_KeyFindings_en_10.pdf pg18&lt;/ref&gt; While renewable energy supplies are growing and have displaced coal in some regions, the amount of coal burned in 2021, is expected to be the same as it was in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/MediumTermCoalMarketReport2016ExecutiveSummaryEnglishversion.pdf pg3&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hydroelectricity ===
[[File:Chief Joseph Dam.jpg|thumb|[[Chief Joseph Dam]] near [[Bridgeport, Washington]], US, is a major run-of-the-river station without a sizeable reservoir.]]
In 2015, [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric energy]] generated 16.6% of the worlds total electricity and 70% of all renewable electricity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/GSR_2016_Full_Report_REN21.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe and North America environmental concerns around land flooded by large [[reservoir]]s ended 30 years of dam construction in the 1990s. Since then large dams and reservoirs continue to be built in countries like China, Brazil and India. [[Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity]] and [[small hydro]] have become popular alternatives to conventional dams that may create reservoirs in environmentally sensitive areas.

=== Wind power ===
{{Main|Wind farm}}
[[File:Turbiny wiatrowe w Szwecji, 2011 ubt.JPG|thumb|[[Lillgrund Wind Farm]] in Sweden]]
[[File:windpark Estinnes 20juli2010 kort voor voltooiing.jpg|thumb|First wind farm consisting of 7,5&amp;nbsp;MW Enercon E-126 turbines, [[Estinnes]], [[Belgium]], 20 July 2010, two months before completion; note the 2-part blades.]]

A wind farm is a group of [[wind turbine]]s in the same location used to produce electric power. A large wind farm may consist of several hundred individual wind turbines, and cover an extended area of hundreds of square miles, but the land between the turbines may be used for agricultural or other purposes. A wind farm may also be located offshore.

Wind power has grown dramatically since 2005 and by 2015 supplied almost 1% of global energy consumption.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/REN21_GSR2016_KeyFindings_en_10.pdf page 18&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the largest operational onshore wind farms are located in the United States and China. The [[Gansu Wind Farm]] in China has over 5,000&amp;nbsp;MW installed with a goal of 20,000&amp;nbsp;MW by 2020. China has several other "wind power bases" of similar size.

{{See also|Concentrated solar power}}
Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam. The concentrated heat is then used as a heat source for a conventional power plant. A wide range of concentrating technologies exists; the most developed are the parabolic trough, the concentrating linear fresnel reflector, the Stirling dish and the solar power tower. Various techniques are used to track the Sun and focus light. In all of these systems a [[working fluid]] is heated by the concentrated sunlight, and is then used for power generation or energy storage.&lt;ref name="Martin 2005"&gt;Martin and Goswami (2005), p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nuclear energy ===
The 2014 [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] report identifies nuclear energy as one of the technologies that can  provide electricity with less than 5% of the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of coal power.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg3/ipcc_wg3_ar5_chapter7.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; There are more than 60 nuclear reactors shown as under construction in the list of [[Nuclear power by country]] with China leading at 23. Globally, more nuclear power reactors have closed than opened in recent years but overall capacity has increased.&lt;ref name="econ13"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2013/11/difference-engine-0|title=Difference Engine: The nuke that might have been|date=11 November 2013|author=|work=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt; China has stated its plans to double nuclear generation by 2030. India also plans to greatly increase its nuclear power.

Several countries have enacted laws to cease construction on new nuclear power stations. Several European countries have debated [[Nuclear power phase-out|nuclear phase-outs]] and others have completely shut down some reactors. Three [[nuclear accidents]] have influenced the slowdown of nuclear power: the 1979 [[Three Mile Island accident]] in the United States, the 1986 [[Chernobyl disaster]] in the USSR, and the 2011 [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]] in Japan. Following the March 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, Germany has permanently shut down eight of its 17 reactors and pledged to close the rest by the end of 2022.&lt;ref name="Annika Breidthardt"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/05/30/us-germany-nuclear-idUKTRE74Q2P120110530|title=German government wants nuclear exit by 2022 at latest|date=30 May 2011|work=Reuters|author=Annika Breidthardt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italy voted overwhelmingly to keep their country non-nuclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://referendum.interno.it/referendum/refe110612/RFT0003.htm|title=Italy Nuclear Referendum Results|date=13 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325171121/http://referendum.interno.it/referendum/refe110612/RFT0003.htm|archivedate=25 March 2012|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Switzerland and Spain have banned the construction of new reactors.&lt;ref name="nweek11"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2011/11/27/post-fukushima-nuclear-power-changes-latitudes.html|title=Nuclear Power Goes Rogue|date=28 November 2011|author=[[Henry Sokolski]]|work=Newsweek}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan's prime minister has called for a dramatic reduction in Japan's reliance on nuclear power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-28/nuclear-promotion-dropped-in-japan-energy-policy-after-fukushima.html|title=Nuclear Promotion Dropped in Japan Energy Policy After Fukushima|date=28 October 2011|lastauthoramp=yes|author1=Tsuyoshi Inajima|author2=Yuji Okada|work=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taiwan's president did the same. [[Shinzō Abe]], the new prime minister of Japan since December 2012, announced a plan to restart some of the 54 Japanese nuclear power plants and to continue some nuclear reactors under construction.

=== Energy efficiency ===
{{Main|Efficient energy use}}

Moving away from fossil fuels will require changes not only in the way energy is supplied, but in the way it is used, and reducing the amount of energy required to deliver various goods or services is essential{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}. Opportunities for improvement on the demand side of the energy equation are as rich and diverse as those on the supply side, and often offer significant economic benefits.&lt;ref&gt;InterAcademy Council (2007). [http://www.interacademycouncil.net/Object.File/Master/12/053/Executive%20Summary.pdf ''Lighting the way: Toward a sustainable energy future''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128074454/http://www.interacademycouncil.net/Object.File/Master/12/053/Executive%20Summary.pdf |date=28 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sustainable energy economy requires commitments to both renewables and efficiency.  Renewable energy and [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] are said to be the "twin pillars" of [[sustainable energy]] policy. [[American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy|The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy]] has explained that both resources must be developed in order to stabilize and reduce carbon dioxide emissions:&lt;ref name=am&gt;American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (2007). [http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090429195906/http://www.aceee.org/store/proddetail.cfm?CFID=785209&amp;CFTOKEN=22090724&amp;ItemID=432&amp;CategoryID=7 ''The Twin Pillars of Sustainable Energy: Synergies between Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Technology and Policy''] Report E074.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Efficiency is essential to slowing the energy demand growth so that rising clean energy supplies can make deep cuts in fossil fuel use. If energy use grows too fast, renewable energy development will chase a receding target. Likewise, unless clean energy supplies come online rapidly, slowing demand growth will only begin to reduce total emissions; reducing the carbon content of energy sources is also needed.&lt;ref name=am /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The IEA has stated that renewable energy and energy efficiency policies are complementary tools for the development of a sustainable energy future, and should be developed together instead of being developed in isolation.&lt;ref&gt;International Energy Agency (2007). [http://www.iea.org/Textbase/work/2007/bestpractice/Workshop_Proceedings.pdf ''Global Best Practice in Renewable Energy Policy Making'']&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] gives the relationship between [[differential calculus]] and [[integral calculus]], which are two distinct branches that are not obviously related. Being "fundamental" does not necessarily mean that it is the most basic result. For example, the proof of the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]] requires [[Euclid's lemma]], which in turn requires [[Bézout's identity]].

The names are mostly traditional, so that for example the ''fundamental theorem of arithmetic'' is basic to what would now be called [[number theory]].

The mathematical literature sometimes refers to the '''fundamental lemma''' of a field. The term [[lemma (mathematics)|lemma]] is conventionally used to denote a proven proposition which is used as a stepping stone to a larger result rather than as a useful statement in-and-of itself. The fundamental lemma of a field is often, but not always, the same as the fundamental theorem of that field.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18934">'''Geochemical modeling''' is the practice of using [[chemical thermodynamics]], [[chemical kinetics]], or both, to analyze the [[chemical reactions]] that affect [[Geology|geologic systems]], commonly with the aid of a computer. It is used in high-temperature [[geochemistry]] to simulate reactions occurring deep in the Earth's interior, in [[magma]], for instance, or to model low-temperature reactions in [[aqueous solutions]] near the Earth's surface, the subject of this article.

== Applications to aqueous systems ==
Geochemical modeling is used in a variety of fields, including environmental [[Environmental protection|protection]] and [[Environmental remediation|remediation]],&lt;ref&gt;Zhu, C. and G. Anderson, 2002, ''Environmental Applications of Geochemical Modeling''. Cambridge University Press, 300 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[petroleum industry]], and [[economic geology]].&lt;ref name = "GBRM"&gt;Bethke, C.M., 2008, ''Geochemical and Biogeochemical Reaction Modeling''. Cambridge University Press, 547 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Models can be constructed, for example, to understand the composition of natural waters; the mobility and breakdown of [[Pollution|contaminants]] in flowing [[groundwater]] or [[surface water]]; the formation and dissolution of rocks and [[minerals]] in geologic formations in response to injection of industrial wastes, steam, or [[Carbon sequestration|carbon dioxide]]; and the generation of [[Acid mine drainage|acidic waters]] and leaching of metals from mine wastes.

== Development of geochemical modeling ==
[[Robert Garrels|Garrels]] and Thompson (1962) first applied chemical modeling to geochemistry in 25&amp;nbsp;°C and one atmosphere total pressure.  Their calculation, computed by hand, is now known as an ''equilibrium model'', which predicts species distributions, mineral saturation states, and gas fugacities from measurements of bulk solution composition. By removing small aliquots of [[solvent]] water from an equilibrated spring water and repeatedly recalculating the species distribution, Garrels and Mackenzie (1967) simulated the reactions that occur as spring water evaporated.&lt;ref&gt;Garrels, R.M. and F.T. Mackenzie, 1967, Origin of the chemical compositions of some springs and lakes. ''Equilibrium Concepts in Natural Waters, Advances in Chemistry Series'' '''67''', American Chemical Society, Washington, DC, pp. 222-242&lt;/ref&gt; This coupling of mass transfer with an equilibrium model, known as a ''reaction path model'', enabled geochemists to simulate reaction processes.

[[Harold C. Helgeson|Helgeson]] (1968) introduced the first computer program to solve equilibrium and reaction path models,&lt;ref&gt;Helgeson, H.C., 1968, Evaluation of irreversible reactions in geochemical processes involving minerals and aqueous solutions, I. Thermodynamic relations. ''Geochemica et Cosmochimica Acta'' '''32''', 853-877&lt;/ref&gt; which he and coworkers used to model geological processes like [[weathering]], sediment [[diagenesis]], [[evaporation]], [[hydrothermal alteration]], and [[Ore genesis|ore deposition]].&lt;ref&gt;Helgeson, H.C., R.M. Garrels and F.T. Mackenzie, 1969, Evaluation of irreversible reactions in geochemical processes involving minerals and aqueous solutions, II. Applications. ''Geochemica et Cosmochimica Acta'' '''33''', 455-481&lt;/ref&gt; Later developments in geochemical modeling included reformulating the governing equations, first as [[ordinary differential equations]], then later as [[algebraic equations]]. Additionally, [[Component (thermodynamics)|chemical components]] came to be represented in models by aqueous species, minerals, and gases, rather than by the elements and electrons which make up the species, simplifying the governing equations and their numerical solution.&lt;ref name="GBRM" /&gt;

Recent improvements in the power of personal computers and [[#Software programs in common use|modeling software]] have made geochemical models more accessible and more flexible in their implementation.&lt;ref&gt;Zhu, C., 2009, Geochemical Modeling of Reaction Paths and Geochemical Reaction Networks. In E.H. Oelkers and J. Schott(eds.), 2009, Thermodynamics and Kinetics of Water-Rock Interaction. ''Reviews in Mineralogy and Geochemistry'' '''70''', 533-569&lt;/ref&gt; Geochemists are now able to construct on their laptops complex reaction path or [[Reactive transport modeling in porous media|reactive transport models]] which previously would have required a supercomputer.&lt;ref&gt;Brady, P.V. and C.M. Bethke, 2000, Beyond the Kd approach. ''Ground Water'' '''38''', 321-322&lt;/ref&gt;

== Setting up a geochemical model ==
An aqueous system is uniquely defined by its chemical composition, [[temperature]], and [[pressure]].&lt;ref name = "Anderson"&gt;Anderson, G.M. 2009, ''Thermodynamics of Natural Systems''. Cambridge University Press, 664 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;  Creating geochemical models of such systems begins by choosing the basis, the set of [[Chemical species|aqueous species]], [[minerals]], and [[gases]] which are used to write chemical reactions and express composition. The number of basis entries required equals the number of [[Component (thermodynamics)|components]] in the system, which is fixed by the [[Gibbs' phase rule|phase rule]] of thermodynamics. Typically, the basis is composed of water, each mineral in equilibrium with the system, each gas at known [[fugacity]], and important aqueous species. Once the basis is defined, a modeler can solve for the [[chemical equilibrium|equilibrium state]], which is described by [[Law of mass action|mass action]] and mass balance equations for each component.&lt;ref name="GBRM" /&gt;

In finding the equilibrium state, a geochemical modeler solves for the distribution of mass of all species, minerals, and gases which can be formed from the basis. This includes the [[Activity (chemistry)|activity]], [[activity coefficient]], and [[concentration]] of aqueous species, the [[saturation (chemistry)|saturation]] state of minerals, and the fugacity of gases. Minerals with a saturation index (log Q/K) equal to zero are said to be in equilibrium with the fluid. Those with positive saturation indices are termed [[supersaturation|supersaturated]], indicating they are favored to precipitate from solution. A mineral is undersaturated if its saturation index is negative, indicating that it is favored to dissolve.&lt;ref name = "Anderson" /&gt;

Geochemical modelers commonly create reaction path models to understand how systems respond to changes in composition, temperature, or pressure. By configuring the manner in which mass and heat transfer are specified (i.e., open or closed systems), models can be used to represent a variety of geochemical processes. Reaction paths can assume chemical equilibrium, or they can incorporate kinetic rate laws to calculate the timing of reactions. In order to predict the distribution in space and time of the chemical reactions that occur along a flowpath, geochemical models are increasingly being coupled with [[Groundwater model|hydrologic models]] of mass and heat transport to form [[Reactive transport modeling in porous media|reactive transport models]].&lt;ref name="GBRM" /&gt; Specialized geochemical modeling programs that are designed as cross-linkable re-entrant software objects enable construction of reactive transport models of any flow configuration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ChemPlugin.ORG|url=http://chemplugin.org/|publisher=Aqueous Solutions LLC|accessdate=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of reactions ==
Geochemical models are capable of simulating many different types of [[Chemical reaction|reactions]]. Included among them are: 
*[[Acid-base reactions]]
*[[Coordination complex|Aqueous complexation]]
*Mineral [[Dissolution (chemistry)|dissolution]] and [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]]
*Reduction and oxidation ([[redox]]) reactions, including those catalyzed by [[enzyme]]s, [[Reactions on surfaces|surfaces]], and [[microorganism]]s
*[[Adsorption|Sorption]], [[ion exchange]], and surface complexation
*Gas dissolution and [[Degasification|exsolution]]
*[[Stable isotope|Stable isotope fractionation]]
*[[Radioactive decay]]

Simple [[phase diagrams]] or plots are commonly used to illustrate such geochemical reactions. Eh-pH [[Pourbaix diagram|(Pourbaix)]] diagrams, for example, are a special type of activity diagram which represent acid-base and redox chemistry graphically.

== Uncertainties in geochemical modelling ==
Various sources can contribute to a range of simulation results. The range of the simulation results is defined as model uncertainty. One of the most important sources not possible to quantify is the conceptual model, which is developed and defined by the modeller. Further sources are the parameterization of the model regarding the hydraulic (only when simulating transport) and mineralogical properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dethlefsen|first=Frank|last2=Haase|first2=Christoph|last3=Ebert|first3=Markus|last4=Dahmke|first4=Andreas|date=2011-01-01|title=Effects of the variances of input parameters on water-mineral interactions during CO2 sequestration modeling|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187661021100590X|journal=Energy Procedia|series=10th International Conference on Greenhouse Gas Control Technologies|volume=4|pages=3770–3777|doi=10.1016/j.egypro.2011.02.311}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parameters used for the geochemical simulations can also contribute to model uncertainty. These are the applied thermodynamic database and the parameters for the kinetic minerals dissolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haase|first=Christoph|last2=Dethlefsen|first2=Frank|last3=Ebert|first3=Markus|last4=Dahmke|first4=Andreas|date=2013-06-01|title=Uncertainty in geochemical modelling of CO2 and calcite dissolution in NaCl solutions due to different modelling codes and thermodynamic databases|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883292713000656|journal=Applied Geochemistry|volume=33|pages=306–317|doi=10.1016/j.apgeochem.2013.03.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Differences in the thermodynamic data (i.e. equilibrium constants, parameters for temperature correction, activity equations and coefficients) can result in large uncertainties. Furthermore, the large spans of experimentally derived rate constants for minerals dissolution rate laws can cause large variations in simulation results. Despite this is well-known, uncertainties are not frequently considered when conducting geochemical modelling.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haase|first=Christoph|last2=Ebert|first2=Markus|last3=Dethlefsen|first3=Frank|date=2016-04-01|title=Uncertainties of geochemical codes and thermodynamic databases for predicting the impact of carbon dioxide on geologic formations|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883292716300087|journal=Applied Geochemistry|volume=67|pages=81–92|doi=10.1016/j.apgeochem.2016.01.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reducing uncertainties can be achieved by comparison of simulation results with experimental data, although experimental data does not exist at every temperature-pressure condition and for every chemical system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although such a comparison or calibration can not be conducted consequently the geochemical codes and thermodynamic databases are state-of-the-art and the most useful tools for predicting geochemical processes.

[[File:Monte di pietà dei pilli, before 1880.jpg|thumb|The [[Monte di Pietà]] dei Pilli in [[Florence]], in a nineteenth-century photograph]]

The '''history of [[pawnbroking]]''' began in the earliest ages of the world. [[usury|Lending]] [[money]] on portable [[Security (finance)|security]] is one of the oldest professions.

==Mosaic law==
The [[613 commandments|Mosaic Law]] struck at the root of pawnbroking as a profitable business, since it forbade the taking of [[interest]] from a poor borrower, while no [[Jew]] was to pay another for timely accommodation. Jews were not, however, forbidden to lend money at interest to gentiles. Until the Protestant Reformation, Christians were likewise forbidden to lend to each other at interest. They too have done so and continue to do so against biblical principle.

==China==
The earliest pawnbrokers were in the 5th Century and were established, owned, and operated by Buddhist monasteries; only later did they become more widely seen in society. They were described in many different terms. The word ''changshengku'' (长生库, long-life treasuries) originally referred to Buddhist monasteries in general. Other terms included ''jifupu'' (seen in [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] texts), ''didangku'' ([[Song dynasty|Song]] period), and ''jiedianku'' ([[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] period). During the Southern Song dynasty, wealthy laypeople would sometimes form partnerships with Buddhist monasteries and open pawnshops (in doing so they had also managed to avoid certain property taxes from which monasteries were sometimes exempt from). For example, a 1202 memorial records the practice of ten people coming together to form an association known as a ''ju (局)'', which would then back the establishment of a pawnshop in a monastery."&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, Michael J. Sacred Economies: Buddhist Monasticism and Territoriality in Medieval China. The Sheng Yen Series in Chinese Buddhist Studies. New York: Columbia University Press, 2009. page 62&lt;/ref&gt;

==Greece and Rome==
Pawning was common in [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome]]; indeed, most of the contemporary law on the subject is derived from the Roman jurisprudence. The chief difference between [[Roman law|Roman]] and [[English law]] is that under Roman law certain things, such as wearing apparel, furniture, and instruments of tillage, could not be pledged, whereas there is no such restriction in English legislation. The emperor [[Augustus]] converted the surplus arising to the state from the confiscated property of criminals into a fund from which the state lent money without interest to those who pledged valuables equal to double the amount borrowed.

==Medieval Europe==
In [[Italy]], but in more modern times, the pledge system that became almost universal on the continent of Europe arose. In its origin that system was purely benevolent, the early "[[Mont de Piété|monts de piete]]" established by the authority of the popes lending money to the poor only, without interest, on the sole condition of the advances being covered by the value of the pledges. This was virtually the Augustan system, but it is obvious that an institution that costs money to manage and derives no income from its operations must either limit its usefulness to the extent of the voluntary support it can command, or must come to a speedy end.

In [[1198]] something of the kind was started at [[Freising]] in [[Bavaria]].&lt;ref name="Steensma"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Steensma |first1=David P. |title="Pawn Ball Megakaryocytes": From the Marvellous Medici and Dear Old Saint Nick to the Unsanctified Marrow of Myelodysplasia |journal=Hematology |date=2003 |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=11–18 |doi=10.1080/1024533031000081397}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1350]] a similar endeavour was made at [[Salins-les-Bains|Salins]] in [[Franche-Comté]], where interest at the rate of 7½% was charged.

Nor was England backward, for in [[1361]] Michael Northbury, or de Northborough, bishop of [[London]], bequeathed 1000 silver marks for the establishment of a free pawnshop.

These primitive efforts, like the later Italian ones, all failed. The [[Holy See|Vatican]] was therefore constrained to allow the ''Sacri monti di pietà'' (satisfactory derivation of the phrase has yet been suggested) to charge sufficient interest to their customers to enable them to pay for expenses. Thereupon a learned and tedious controversy arose upon the lawfulness of charging interest, which was only finally set at rest by [[Pope Leo X]], who in the tenth sitting of the [[First Council of the Lateran]], declared that the pawnshop was a lawful and valuable institution, and threatened with [[excommunication]] those who should presume to express doubts on the subject. The [[Council of Trent]] inferentially confirmed this decision, and at a somewhat later date we find [[Charles Borromeo|St Charles Borromeo]] counselling the establishment of state or municipal pawnshops.

Long before this, however, ''monti di pietà'' commonly charged interest for loans in Italy. The date of their establishment was not later than 1464, when the earliest of which there appears to be any record in that country—it was at [[Orvieto]]—was confirmed by [[Pius II]]. Three years later another was opened at [[Perugia]] by the efforts of two Franciscans, [[Barnabus Interamnensis]] and [[Fortunatus de Copolis]]. They collected the necessary capital by preaching, and the Perugian pawnshop was opened with such success that there was a substantial balance of profit at the end of the first year.

The [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] endeavoured to preach down the lending-house, but without avail. [[Viterbo]] obtained one in 1469, and [[Sixtus IV]] confirmed another to his native town in [[Savona]] in 1479.

After the death of Brother Barnabus in [[1474]], a strong impulse was given to the creation of these establishments by the preaching of another Franciscan, Father [[Bernandino di Feltre]], who was in due course canonized. By his efforts monti di pietà were opened at [[Assisi]], [[Mantua]], [[Parma]], [[Lucca]], [[Piacenza]], [[Padua]], [[Vicenza]], [[Pavia]] and a number of places of less importance.

At [[Florence]] the veiled opposition of the municipality and the open hostility of the Jews prevailed against him, and it was reserved to [[Savonarola]], a Dominican, to create the first Florentine pawnshop, after the local theologians had declared that there was no sin, even [[venial sin|venial]], in charging interest. The readiness of the popes to give permission for pawnshops all over Italy, makes it the more remarkable that the [[Rome|papal capital]] possessed nothing of the kind until [[1539]], and even then owed the convenience to a Franciscan.

From Italy the pawnshop spread gradually all over Europe. [[Augsburg]] adopted the system in 1591, [[Nuremberg]] copied the Augsburg regulations in 1618, and by 1622 it was established at [[Amsterdam]], [[Brussels]], [[Antwerp]] and [[Ghent]]. [[Madrid]] followed suit in 1705, when a priest opened a charitable pawnshop with a capital of fivepence taken from an alms-box.

==Modern period==
:''Below are historical paragraphs on various countries from the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica, which ends in the early 20th century, and are therefore probably not true for the 20th century''.

===Britain and Ireland===
{{copy edit section|date=September 2018}}
In England the pawnbroker, like so many other distinguished personages, came in with [[William the Conqueror]].&lt;ref name="Johnson 2017"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Johnson |first1=Ben |title=The Pawnbroker |url=https://www.historic-uk.com/CultureUK/The-Pawnbroker/ |website=Historic UK |date=2017 |accessdate=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, despite the valuable services the class rendered, not infrequently to the Crown itself, the usurer was treated with studied cruelty. Sir [[Walter Scott]]'s [[Isaac of York]] was no mere creation of fiction. These barbarities began, by diminishing the number of Jews in the country, long before Edward's decree of banishment, to make it worth the while of the [[Lombardy|Lombard]] merchants to settle in England.  In 1338 [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] pawned his jewels to the Lombards to raise money for his war with France.&lt;ref name=Steensma /&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnson 2017" /&gt; An equally great king [[Henry V of England|Henry V]] did much the same in 1415.

====Under Henry VII====
The [[Lombard banking|Lombard]]s were not a popular class, and [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] harried them a good deal. In the very first year of [[James VI and I|James I]]'s reign an Act against Brokers was passed and remained on the statute-book until 1872. It was aimed at counterfeit brokers, of whom there were then many in London. This type of broker was evidently regarded as a mere receiver of stolen goods, for the act provided that no sale or pawn of any stolen jewels, plate or other goods to any pawnbroker in [[London]] or [[Westminster]] or [[Southwark]] shall alter the property therein, and that pawnbrokers refusing to produce goods to their owner from whom stolen shall forfeit double the value.

====Under Charles I====
In the time of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] another act made it clear that the pawnbroker was not deemed a respectable or trustworthy person. Nevertheless, a plan was mooted for setting that king up in the business. The [[English Civil War|Civil War]] was approaching and supplies were badly needed, when a too ingenious Royalist proposed the establishment of a state pawnhouse. The preamble of the scheme recited how "''the intolerable injuries done to the poore subjects by brokers and usurers that take 30, 40, 50, 60, and more in the hundredth, may be remedied and redressed, the poor thereby greatly relieved and eased, and His Majestie much benefited''". That the king would have been much benefited is obvious, since he was to enjoy two-thirds of the profits, while the working capital of £100,000 was to be found by the city of London. The reform of what [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] calls "broking pawn" was in the air at that time, although nothing ever came of it, and in the early days of the commonwealth it was proposed to establish a kind of "[[mont de pieté]]". The idea was emphasized in a pamphlet of 1651 entitled "''Observatsons manifesting the Conveniency and Commodity of Mount Pieteyes, or Public Bancks for Relief of the Poor or Others in Distress, upon Pawns''". No doubt many a ruined [[cavalier]] would have been glad enough of some such means of raising money, but this radical change in the principles of English pawnbroking was never brought about. It is said that the [[Bank of England]], under its charter, has power to establish pawnshops; and we learn from ''A Short History of the Bank of England'', published in its very early days, that it was the intention of the directors, for the ease of the poor, to institute a Lombard for small pawns at a penny a pound interest per month (= 5% per year).&lt;ref&gt;In the old British [[Pound sterling|sterling]] money, there were 240 pennies in a pound.&lt;/ref&gt;

====1600 to 1800====
Throughout both the 17th and 18th centuries the general suspicion of the pawnbroker appears to have been only too well founded. During [[George II of Great Britain|George II]]'s reign [[Henry Fielding|Fielding]] wrote a book ''[[Amelia (novel)|Amelia]]''; references in that book seem to show that, taken in the mass, Fielding was not a very scrupulous tradesman. Before about that time it was customary for [[publican]]s to lend money on pledges so their customers could drink, but the practice was at last stopped by [[Act of Parliament]].

Also, respect for the honesty of pawnbroking was harmed by the [[Charitable Corporation]]'s actions, during which affair it was pointed out that pawnbroking, by affording an easy method of raising money upon valuables, encourages dishonesty, by:-
* Furnishing the thief and [[pickpocket]] with a better opportunity to sell their stolen goods.
* Letting a man intending to become [[bankrupt]] buy goods on [[Credit (finance)|credit]] and dispose of them for ready money, defrauding his [[creditor]]s.

====Pawnbroker's licence law, 1785====
The pawnbroker's licence dates from 1785, the duty being fixed at £10 in London and £5 in the country; and at the same time the interest chargeable was settled at ½% per Modern month, the duration of loans being confined to one Regulations year. Five years later the interest on advances in England between 2 and 10 was raised to 15%.

The modern history of legislation affecting pawnbroking begins, however, in 1800, when the act of ~9 &amp; 40 Geo. III. c. 99 (1800) was passed, in great measure by the influence of [[John Scott, 1st Earl of Eldon|Lord Eldon]], who never made any secret of the fact that, when he was a young [[barrister]] without [[brief (law)|briefs]], he had often been indebted to the timely aid of the pawnshop. The pawnbrokers were grateful, and for many years after Lord Eldon's death they continued to drink his health at their trade dinners. The measure increased the rate of interest to {{frac|1|2|3}}% per month, which is 20% a year unless unpaid interest adds to the debt. Loans were to be granted for a year, but pledges might be redeemed up to fifteen months, and the first week of the second month was not to count for interest.

The act worked well, on the whole, for 75 years, but it was amended 3 times:-
* 1815: Licence duties were raised to £15 for London and £7.50 for the country.
* 1840: An Act of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] abolished the reward to the common informer for reporting illegal rates of interest.
* 1860: The pawnbroker was empowered to charge a halfpenny (= about 0.2 p) for the pawn-ticket when the loan was under five shillings (= 25p).

As time went on, however, the main provisions of the act of 1800 were found to be very irksome, and the Pawnbrokers National Association and the Pawnbrokers Defence Association worked hard to obtain a liberal revision of the law. It was argued that the [[usury]] laws had been abolished for the whole of the community except only for the pawnbroker who advanced less than £10. The limitations of the act of 1800 interfered so considerably with the pawnbrokers' profits that, it was argued, they could not afford to lend money on bulky articles needing extensive storage room. In 1870 the House of Commons appointed a Select Committee on Pawnbrokers, and it was stated in evidence before that body that in the previous year 207,780,000 pledges were lodged, of which between thirty and forty millions were lodged in London. The average value of pledges appeared to be about 4s., and it was claimed that the proportion of articles pawned dishonestly was found to be only 1 in 14,000.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}&lt;!-- bad reading by a text scanner and OCR?--&gt; Later official statistics show that of the forfeited pledges sold in London less than 20 per million are claimed by the police.

====Pawnbroker's licence law, 1872====
The result of the Select Committee was the Pawnbrokers Act of 1872, which repealed, altered and consolidated all previous legislation on the subject, and is still the measure which regulates the relations between the public and pawnbrokers. It was based mainly on the Irish law passed by the [[Union Parliament]]. It put an end to the old irritating restrictions, and reduced the annual tax in London from £15 to the £7.50 paid in the provinces. By the provisions of the Act (which does not affect loans above £10):-
* A pledge is redeemable within one year, and seven days of grace added to the year.
* Pledges pawned for £0.50 or under and not redeemed in time become the property of the pawnbroker.
* Pledges above £0.50 are redeemable until sale, which must be by [[public auction]].
* In addition to one halfpenny (= about 0.2 p) for the pawn-ticket (sometimes not charged for very small pawns) the pawnbroker is entitled to charge as interest one halfpenny per month on every 2s. or part of 2s. lent where the loan is under £2, and on every 2s. 6d. where the loan is above £2. (''Note: "s." = [[shilling]] = 5p.'')
* Special contracts may be made where the loan is above £2, at a rate of interest agreed on between lender and borrower.
* These made offences punishable by summary conviction:-
** Unlawful pawning of goods not the property of the pawner.
** Taking in pawn any article from a person under the age of twelve, or intoxicated.
** Taking in pawn any linen or apparel or unfinished goods or materials entrusted to wash, make up, etc.
* A new pawnbroker must produce a [[magistrate]]'s certificate before he can receive a licence.
* The permit cannot be refused if the applicant gives sufficient evidence that he is a person of good character.
* The word "pawnbroker" must always be inscribed in large letters over the door of the shop.

Elaborate provisions are made to safeguard the interests of borrowers whose unredeemed pledges are sold under the act. Thus the sales by auction may take place only on the first Monday of January, April, July and October, and on the following days should one day not be sufficient. This legislation was, no doubt, favorable to the pawnbroker rather than to the borrower. The annual interest on loans of 2s. had been increased by successive acts of parliament from 6% in 1784 to 25% in 1800, and to 27% in 1860, and re-set at 27% in 1872. The annual interest on a loan of half-a-crown (now 12½p) is now 260%, as compared with 173 in 1860 and 86 in 1784; the extreme point is reached in the case of a loan of 1s. for three days, in which case the interest is at the rate of 1014% per annum.

An English ''[[mont de piété]]'' was once projected by the [[Salvation Army]], and in 1894 the [[London County Council]] considered the practicability of municipal effort on similar lines; but in neither case was anything done.

====Scotland and Ireland====

The growth of pawnbroking in [[Scotland]], where the law as to pledge agrees generally with that of England, is remarkable.

Early in the 19th century there was only one pawnbroker in [[Ireland]], and in 1833 there were only 52. Even in 1865 there were no more than 312. It is probable that [[Glasgow]] and [[Edinburgh]] together contain nearly as many as that total. In Ireland the rates for loans are practically identical with those charged in England, but a penny instead of a halfpenny is paid for the ticket. Articles pledged for less than Li must be redeemed within six months, but nine months are allowed when the amount is between 3os. and 2. For sums over 2 the period is a year, as in England. In Ireland, too, a fraction of a month is calculated as a full month for purposes of interest, whereas in England, after the first month, fortnights are recognized. In 1838 there was an endeavour to establish monts de piété in Ireland, but the scheme was so unsuccessful that in 1841 the eight charitable pawnshops that had been opened had a total adverse balance of 5340. By 1847 only three were left, and eventually they collapsed likewise.

===United States===
The pawnbroker in the [[United States]] is, generally speaking, subject to considerable legal restriction, but violations of the laws and ordinances are frequent. Each state has its own regulations, but those of [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Massachusetts]] may be taken as fairly representative.

Brokers of pawn are usually licensed by the mayors, or by the mayors and aldermen, but in [[Boston]] the police commissioners are the licensing authority. In the state of New York permits are renewable annually on payment of $500, and the pawnbroker must file a surety bond with the Department of Consumer Affairs, in the sum of $10,000. The business is conducted on much the same lines as in England.  The rate of interest is 4% per month and the loan is written for a period of 4 months, with an additional 30-day grace period. To enact higher rates is a misdemeanor. Unredeemed pledges may be sold at any time after the legal time for the loan. New York contains one pawnshop to every 12,000 inhabitants. In the state of Massachusetts unredeemed pledges may be sold four months after the date of deposit. The licensing authority may fix the rate of interest, which may vary for different amounts, and in Boston every pawnbroker is bound to furnish to the police daily a list of the pledges taken in during the preceding twenty-four hours, specifying the hour of each transaction and the amount lent.

Major pawnshop chains include [[Cash America International]] and [[First Cash Financial Services]], both headquartered in Texas.

===Europe===
The fact that on the continent of Europe monts de piété are almost invariably either a state or a municipal monopoly necessarily places them upon an entirely different footing from the British pawnshop, but, compared with the English system, the foreign is very elaborate and rather cumbersome. Moreover, in addition to being slow in its operation, it is, generally speaking, based upon the supposition that the borrower carries in his pockets papers testifying to his identity. On the other hand, it is argued that the English borrower of more than 2 is at the mercy of the pawnbroker in the matter of interest, that sum being the highest for which a legal limit of interest is fixed. The rate of interest upon a special contract may be, and often is, high. For the matter of that, indeed, this system of obtaining loans is always expensive, either in actual interest or in collateral disadvantages, whether the lender be a pawnbroker intent upon profit, or the official of a mont de pit. In [[Paris]] the rate charged is 7%, and even then the business is conducted at a loss except in regard to long and valuable pledges. Some of the French provincial rates are as high as 12%, but in almost every case they are less than they were prior to the legislation of 1851 and 1852. The French establishments can only be created by decree of the president of the Republic, with the consent of the local conseil communal. In Paris the prefect of the [[Seine]] presides over the business; in the provinces the mayor is the president. The administrative council is drawn one-third each from the conseil communal, the governors of charitable societies, and the townspeople. A large proportion of the capital required for conducting the institutions has to be raised by loan, while some part of the property they possess is the product of gifts and legacies. The profits of the Paris mont de pit are paid over to the Assistance Publique, the comprehensive term used by France to indicate the body of charitable foundations. Originally this was the rule throughout France, but now many of them are entirely independent of the charitable institutions. Counting the head office, the branches and the auxiliary shops, the Paris establishment has its doors open in some fifty or sixty districts; but the volume of its annual business is infinitely smaller than that transacted by the London pawnbrokers. The amount to be advanced by a municipal pawnshop is fixed by an official called the commissaire-priseur, who is compelled to load the scales against the borrower, since, should the pledge remain unredeemed and be sold for less than was lent upon it, he has to make good the difference. This official is paid at the rate of 3/4% upon loans and renewals, and 3% on the amount obtained by the sales of forfeited pledges. This is obviously the weakest part of the French system. The Paris mont de pit undertakes to lend four-fifths of the intrinsic value of articles made from the precious metals, and two-thirds of that of other articles. The maximum and minimum that may be advanced are also fixed. The latter varies in different parts of the country from one to three francs, and the former from a very small sum to the 10,000 francs that is the rule in Paris. Loans are granted for twelve months with right of renewal, and unredeemed pledges may then be sold by auction, but the proceeds may be claimed by the borrower at any time within three years. Pledges may be redeemed by instalments.

Somewhere between forty and fifty French towns possess municipal pawnshops, a few of which, like those of [[Grenoble]] and [[Montpellier]], having been endowed, charge no interest. Elsewhere the rate varies from nil in some towns, for very small pledges, to 10%. The constant tendency throughout France has been to reduce the rate. The great establishment in Paris obtains part of its working capital reserves and surplus forming the balance by borrowing money at a rate varying from 2 to 3% according to the loan term (duration). Under a law passed in 18gf the Paris mont de pit makes advances upon securities at 6%, plus a duty of 5 centimes upon every hundred francs. The maximum that can be lent in this way is 20. Up to 80% is lent on the face value of government stock and on its own bonds, and 75% upon other securities; but 60% only may be advanced on railway shares. These advances are made for six months. Persons wishing to borrow a larger sum than sixteen francs from the Paris mont de pit have to produce their papers of identity. In every case a numbered metal check is given to the customer, and a duplicate is attached to the article itself. The appraising clerks decide upon the sum that can be lent, and the amount is called out with the number. If the borrower is dissatisfied he can take away his property, but if he accepts the offer he has to give I till particulars of his name, address and occupation. Experts calculate that every transaction that involves less than twenty-two francs results in a loss to the Paris mont de pit—only those that exceed eighty-five francs are profitable. The average loan is under thirty francs.

===The Netherlands and Belgium===
Borrowing money on the security of deposited goods has been the subject of minute regulations in the [[Low Countries]] from as far back as the year 1600.

The archdukes Albert and Isabella, governors of the [[Spanish Netherlands]] under [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]], reduced the lawful rate of interest from 32 3/4 to 21 3/4%; but since extortion continued they introduced the [[Mount of piety|mont de pit]] in 1618, and, as we have already seen, in the course of a dozen years the institution was established in all the populous [[Belgium|Belgian]] towns, with one or two exceptions. The interest chargeable to borrowers was fixed originally at 15%, but was shortly afterwards reduced, to be again increased to nearly the old level. Meanwhile, various towns possessed charitable funds for gratuitous loans, apart from the official institutions. Shortly after the mont de pit was introduced in the Spanish provinces, the [[prince-bishop of Liège]], [[Ferdinand of Bavaria]], followed the example set by the archdukes. He ordained that the net profits were to accumulate, and the interest upon the fund to be used in reduction of the charges. The original rate was 15%, when the Lombard money-lenders had been charging 43; but the prince-bishops monts de pit were so successful that for many years their rate of interest did not exceed 5% - it was, indeed, not until 1788 that it was increased by one-half. These flourishing institutions, along with those in Belgium proper, were ruined by the [[French Revolution]]. They were, however, re-established under French dominion, and for many years the laws governing them were constantly altered by the French, Dutch and Belgian governments in turn. The whole subject is now regulated by a law of 1848, supplemented by a new constitution for the [[Brussels]] mont de pit dating from 1891.

The working capital of these official pawnshops is furnished by charitable institutions or the municipalities, but the Brussels one possesses a certain capital of its own in addition. The rate of interest charged in various parts of the country varies from 4 to 16%, but in Brussels it is usually less than half the maximum. The management is very similar to that of the French monts de pit, but the arrangements are much more favorable to the borrower. The ordinary limit of loans is I2o. In [[Antwerp]] there is an anonymous pawnshop, where the customer need not give his name or any other particulars. In the [[Netherlands]] private pawnbrokers flourish side by side with the municipal [[Bank van Lening|Banken van Leening]], nor are there any limitations upon the interest that may be charged. The rules of the official institutions are very similar to those of the monts de pit in the Latin countries, and unredeemed pledges are sold publicly 15 months after being pawned. A large proportion of the advances are made upon gold and diamonds; workmen's tools are not taken in pledge, and the amount lent varies from 8d. upwards. On condition of finding such sum of money as may be required for working capital over and above loans from public institutions, and the caution money deposited by the city officials, the municipality receives the profits.

===Germany===
Pawnbroking in [[Germany]] is conducted at once by the state, by the municipalities, and by private enterprise; but of all these institutions the state loan office in [[Berlin]] is the most interesting. It dates from 1834, and the working capital was found, and still continues to be in part provided, by the Prussian State Bank. The profits are invested, and the interest devoted to charitable purposes. The maximum and minimum rates of interest are fixed, but the rate varies, and often stands at about 12%. Two-thirds of the estimated value is the usual extent of a loan; four-fifths is advanced on silver, and five-sixths on fine gold. State and municipal bonds may be pledged up to a maximum of L150, the advance being 80% of the value, and a fixed interest of 6% is charged upon these securities. The values are fixed by professional valuers, who are liable to make good any loss that may result from over-estimation. The bulk of the loans are under 5, and the state office is used less by the poor than by the middle classes. Loans run for six months, but a further six months' grace is allowed for redemption before the article pledged can be sold by auction. The net annual profit usually amounts to little more than I % upon the capital employed. Pawnbroking laws of [[Austria-Hungary]] are similar to those of England. Free trade exists, and the private trader, who does most of the business, must obtain a government concession and deposit caution-money from 80 to 800, according to the size of the town. He must, however, compete with the monts de pit or Versatzaemter, which are sometimes municipal and sometimes state institutions. The chief of these is the imperial pawn office of [[Vienna]], which was founded with charitable objects by the emperor [[Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph I]] in 1707, and one-half of the annual surplus has still to be paid over to the Vienna poor fund. Here, as in Berlin, the profits are relatively small. Interest is charged at the uniform rate of 10%, which is calculated in two-week periods, however speedily redemption may follow upon pawning. For small loans varying from two to three [[Austro-Hungarian krone|kronen]], 5% only is charged. The [[Hungary|Hungarian]] state and municipal institutions appear, on the whole, to compete somewhat more successfully with the private firms than is the case in Vienna.

===Italy===
In [[Italy]], the country of origin of the mont de piété, the institution still flourishes. It is, as a rule, managed by a committee or commission, and the regulations follow Italy pretty closely the lines of the one in [[Rome]], which never lends less than fod. or more than 40. Four-fifths of the value is lent upon gold, silver and jewels, and two-thirds upon other articles. The interest, which is reckoned monthly, varies with the amount of the loan from 5 to 7%, but no interest is chargeable upon loans up to 5 [[Italian lira|lire]]. A loan runs for six months, and may be renewed for similar periods up to a maximum of five years. If the renewal does not take place within a fortnight of the expiration of the ticket, the pledge is sold, any surplus there may be being paid to the pawner. When more than 10 lire are lent there is a charge of 1% for the ticket. Agencies of the mont de pit are scattered about Rome, and carry on their business under the same rules as the central office, with the disadvantage to the borrower that he has to pay an agents fee. The amount to be advanced by a municipal pawnshop is fixed by an official called the commissaire-priseur, who is compelled to load the scales against the borrower, since, should the pledge remain unredeemed and be sold for less than was lent upon it, he has to make good the difference. This official is paid at the rate of 3/4% upon loans and renewals, and 3% on the amount obtained by the sales of forfeited pledges. The borrower has to pay an agents fee of 2%, which is deducted from the loan. Private pawnshops also exist in Italy, under police authority; but they charge very high interest.

===France===
The institution was very slow in obtaining a footing in France. It was adopted at [[Avignon]] in 1577, and at [[Arras]] in 1624. The doctors of the once powerful [[Collège de Sorbonne|Sorbonne]] could not reconcile themselves to the lawfulness of interest, and when a pawnshop was opened in [[Paris]] in 1626, it had to be closed within a year. Then it was that Jean Boucher published his ''Défense des monts de piété'' in favor of pawnbroking. [[Marseilles]] obtained one in 1695; but it was not until 1777 that the first mont de pit was founded in Paris by royal patent. Statistics for the first few years of its existence show that in the twelve years between 1777 and the Revolution, the average value of the pledges was 42 francs 50 centimes, which is double the present average. The interest charged was 10% per annum, and large profits were made upon the sixteen million livres that were lent every year. The National Assembly, in an evil moment, destroyed the monopoly of the monti de pietà, but it struggled on until 1795, when the competition of the money-lenders compelled it to close its doors. So great, however, were the extortions of the usurers that the people began to clamour for its reopening, and in July 1797 it recommenced business with a fund of ~20,000 found by five private capitalists. At first it charged interest at the rate of 36% per annum, which was gradually reduced, the gradations being 30, 24, 18, 15, and finally 12% in 1804. In i806 it fell to 9%, and in 1887 to 7%. In 1806 [[Napoleon I]] re-established its monopoly, while [[Napoleon III]], as [[prince-president]], regulated it by new laws that are still in force. In Paris the pledge-shop is, in effect, a department of the administration; in the French provinces it is a municipal monopoly; and this remark holds good, with modifications, for most parts of the continent of Europe.

&lt;!--This is obviously the weakest part of the French system.--&gt;
The Paris mont de piété undertakes to lend four-fifths of the intrinsic value of articles made from the precious metals, and two-thirds of that of other articles. The maximum and minimum that may be advanced are also fixed. The latter varies in different parts of the country from one to three francs, and the former from a very small sum to 10,000 francs that is the rule in Paris. Loans are granted for twelve months with right of renewal, and unredeemed pledges may then be sold by auction, but the proceeds may be claimed by the borrower at any time within three years. Pledges may be redeemed by instalments.

===Spain===
The monts de piété in [[Spain]] have for a generation past been inseparably connected with the savings banks. We have already seen that the institution owes its origin in that country to the charitable exertions of a priest who charged no interest, and the system grew until in 1840, a century after his death, the ''mont de pit'' began to receive the sums deposited in the savings bank, which had just been established, for which it paid 5% interest. In 1869 the two institutions were united. This official pawnshop charges 6% upon advances for periods varying from four to twelve months, according to the nature of the article pledged, and a further months grace is allowed before the pledges are sold by auction. Private pawnbrokers are also very numerous, especially in [[Madrid]]; but their usual charges amount to about 60% per annum. They appear, however, to derive advantage from making larger advances than their official rivals, and from doing business during more convenient hours. In [[Portugal]] the monte pio is an amalgamation of bank, benefit society and pawnshop. Its business consists chiefly in lending money upon marketable securities, but it also makes advances upon plate, jewelry and precious stones, and it employs officially licensed valuers. The rate of interest varies with the bank rate, which it slightly exceeds, and the amount advanced upon each article is about three-fourths of its certified value. There is in Portugal a second class of loan establishment answering exactly to the English pawnshop. The pawnbroker is compelled to deposit a sum, in acceptable securities, equal to the capital he proposes to embark, and the register of his transactions must be submitted quarterly to the chief of the police for examination. As regards small transactions, there appears to be no legal limit to the rate of interest. The sale of unredeemed pledges is governed by the law affecting the monte pio geral.

===Russia===
In [[imperial Russia]] the state maintained two pawnbroking establishments, one at [[St Petersburg]] and the other at [[Moscow]], but only articles of gold and silver, precious stones and ingots of the precious metals are accepted by them. Advances are made upon such securities at 6% per annum, and the amounts of the loans are officially limited. Loans run for twelve months, with a months grace before unredeemed pledges are put up to auction. The bulk of this class of business in Russia was, however, conducted by private companies, which advance money upon all descriptions of movable property except stocks and shares. The interest charged was not allowed to exceed I % per month, but there is an additional charge of 4% per month for insurance and safe keeping. The loan runs for a year, with two months grace for redemption before sale. There were also pawnshops conducted by individuals, who find it very difficult to compete with the companies. These shops can only be opened by a police permit, which runs for five years, and security, varying from 100 to 700, has to be deposited; 2% per month is the limit of interest fixed, and two months grace is allowed for redemption after the period for which an article is pledged.

===Denmark===
Pawnbroking in [[Denmark]] dates from 1753, when the Royal Naval Hospital was granted the monopoly of advancing money on pledges and of charging higher interest than the law permitted. The duration of a loan is three months, renewals being allowed. The old law was extended in 1867, and now all pawnbrokers have to be licensed by the municipalities and to pay a small annual licence fee. The rate of interest varies from 6 to 12% according to the amount of the loan, which must not be less than 7d., and unredeemed pledges must be sold by auction.

===Sweden===
[[Sweden]] has no statutes specifically aimed at pawnbroking, with the exception of a proclamation by the governor of [[Stockholm]] that prohibits lending money on articles suspected being stolen. Individuals still carry on the business on a small scale, but the bulk of it is now conducted by companies, which give general satisfaction. For many years Stockholm had a municipal establishment that charged 10% for loans paid out of the city funds. The cost of administration was, however, so great that the establishment suffered an annual loss, and was abolished when, in 1880, a private company called the ''Pant Aktie Bank'' 'pawn bond bank' formed to lend money on furniture and wearing apparel at the rate of 3 öre per krona a month, and 2 öre per krona a month on gold, silver and other valuables. A krona, which equals 1s. 14d., contains 100 öre. Some years later an opposition started that charged only half these rates, with the result that the original enterprise reduced its interest to the same level, charging, however, 2 öre per krona per mensem for bulky articles—a figure now usual for pledges of that description. The money is lent for three months, and at the end of five months the pledge, if unredeemed, is sold by auction under very carefully prescribed conditions. In [[Norway]] a police licence is required for lending money on pawn where the amount advanced does not exceed 4, 10s. Beyond that sum no licence is necessary, but the interest charged must not exceed such a rate as the king may decide.

===Switzerland===
The fate of pawnbroking in [[Switzerland]] appears to be not very dissimilar from that of the Jew who is fabled to have once started in business at [[Aberdeen]]. Nevertheless, the cantons of [[Bern]] and [[Zürich]] enacted elaborate laws for the regulation of the business. In Zürich the broker must be licensed by the cantonal government, and the permit can be refused only when the applicant is known to be a person undeserving of confidence. Regular books have to be kept, which must be at all times open to the inspection of the police, and not more than 1% interest per month may be charged. A loan runs for six months, and unredeemed pledges may be sold by auction a month after the expiration of the fixed period, and then the sale must take place in the parish in which the article was pledged. No more than two persons at a time have ever been licensed under this law, the business being unprofitable owing to the low rate of interest. In the canton of Bern there were once two pawnbrokers. One died and the other put up his shutters. The Zürich cantonal bank, however, conducts a pawnbroking department, which lends nothing under 4s. or over £40 without the special sanction of the bank commission. Loans must not exceed two-thirds of the trade value of the pledge, but 80% may be lent upon the intrinsic value of gold and silver articles. The establishment makes practically no profit. The Swiss disinclination to go to the pawnshop is, perhaps, accounted for in some measure by the growing number of dealers in second-hand articles, to whom persons in want of ready money sell outright such things as are usually pledged, in the hope of subsequently buying them back. Since, however, the dealer is at liberty to ask his own price for repurchase, the expectation is often illusory, and can usually be fulfilled only upon ruinous terms.

==Post-1945==
Pawnbroking declined after the [[Second World War]] due to an increase in [[social welfare]] provision by governments and [[Credit#consumer credit|consumer credit]] by banks.&lt;ref name=Steensma /&gt; Many pawnbrokers attempted to modernise their image and diversify their businesses.&lt;ref name=Steensma /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT 1957"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Spielvogel |first1=Carl |title=Pawnbrokers Report Trade Dip; Prosperity Is Shrinking Business |publisher=New York Times |date=14 April 1957}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pawnbroker's sign gets 'new look' |publisher=The Guardian |date=25 June 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1980s the decline of pawnbroking has stabilised, and even increased in some areas, with many people using pawnbrokers as an alternative to bank or [[Payday loan|payday]] loans.&lt;ref name=Steensma /&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnson 2017" /&gt;

==Symbol==
[[File:Pawnbroker-traditional-symbol.svg|right|framed|Symbol of pawnbrokers]]
{{citationsneeded|date=June 2017}}
The pawnbroker's symbol shows three balls suspended from a bar. The origins of the symbol are unclear, but it is often attributed to the [[House of Medici|Medici Family]] of [[Florence]], [[Italy]].&lt;ref name="NYT 1957" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Steensma /&gt; The family insignia featured rounded objects, which may have represented gold coins or rocks.&lt;ref name=Steensma /&gt; According to one legend, a Medici employed by [[Charlemagne|Charles the Great]] slew a giant using three bags of rocks.&lt;ref name=Steensma /&gt; Since the Medicis were so successful in the financial, banking, and money-lending industries, other families also adopted the symbol. Throughout the Middle Ages, [[heraldry|coats of arms]] bore three balls, orbs, plates, discs, coins and more as symbols of monetary success. 

Another theory attributes the symbol to the [[Lombards]].&lt;ref name="NYT 1957" /&gt; Pawn shop banking originated under the name of [[Lombard banking]], and many European towns called the pawn shop the "Lombard". The three golden balls were originally the symbol medieval Lombard merchants hung up in front of their houses.

A third theory links the symbol to [[Saint Nicholas]] of Myra, the patron saint of pawnbrokers. According to legend he gave a bag of gold to three poor girls to save them from destitution, and these three bags of gold became the three orbs of the symbol.&lt;ref name=Steensma /&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnson 2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT 1957" /&gt;

It has been conjectured{{bywhom|date=June 2017}} that the golden balls were originally three flat yellow effigies of byzants, or gold coins, laid heraldically upon a sable field, but that they were presently converted into balls the better to attract attention.

Pawnbrokers (and their detractors){{who|date=June 2017}} joke that the three balls mean "Two to one, you won't get your stuff back".

In the late twentieth century some pawnbrokers responded to a decline in the industry by removing the traditional symbol.&lt;ref name=Steensma /&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnson 2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT 1957" /&gt;

The '''"hot hand"''' (also known as the '''"hot hand phenomenon"''' or '''"hot hand fallacy"''') is the purported phenomenon that a person who experiences a successful outcome with a [[Randomness|random]] event has a greater [[probability]] of success in further attempts. The concept is often applied to sports and skill-based tasks in general and originates from [[basketball]], whereas a shooter is allegedly more likely to score if their previous attempts were successful, i.e. while having "hot hands". While previous success at a task can indeed change the [[Psychology|psychological]] attitude and subsequent success rate of a player, researchers for many years did not find evidence for a "hot hand" in practice, dismissing it as [[fallacy|fallacious]]. However, later research questioned whether the belief is indeed a fallacy.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/working-papers/hot-hand-fallacy-cognitive-mistakes-or-equilibrium-adjustments|title=The Hot Hand Fallacy: Cognitive Mistakes or Equilibrium Adjustments?

A Truth in the Law of Small Numbers |journal=IGIER Working Paper| number=552|doi=10.2139/ssrn.2627354}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies using modern statistical analysis show there is evidence for the "hot hand" in some sporting activities.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

== Development of theory ==

=== 1985 "Hot Hand in Basketball" paper ===
The fallacy was first described in a 1985 paper by [[Amos Tversky]], [[Thomas Gilovich]], and Robert Vallone. The "Hot Hand in Basketball" study questioned the theory that basketball players have "hot hands", which the paper defined as the claim that players are more likely to make a successful shot if their previous shot was successful. The study looked at the inability of respondents to properly understand [[randomness]] and random events; much like [[innumeracy]] can impair a person's judgement of statistical information, the hot hand fallacy can lead people to form incorrect assumptions regarding random events. The three researchers provide an example in the study regarding the "coin toss"; respondents expected even short sequences of heads and tails to be approximately 50% heads and 50% tails.&lt;ref name="Gilovich1985"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gilovich|first=Thomas |author2=Tversky, A. |author3=Vallone, R.|title=The Hot Hand in Basketball: On the Misperception of Random Sequences|journal=Cognitive Psychology|year=1985|volume=17|issue=3|pages=295–314|doi=10.1016/0010-0285(85)90010-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study proposed two biases that are created by the kind of thought pattern applied to the coin toss: it could lead an individual to believe that the probability of heads or tails increases after a long sequence of either has occurred (known as the [[gambler's fallacy]]); or it could cause an individual to reject randomness due to a belief that a streak of either outcome is not representative of a random sample.&lt;ref name="Gilovich1985" /&gt;

The first study was conducted via a questionnaire of 100 basketball fans from the colleges of [[Cornell University|Cornell]] and [[Stanford University|Stanford]]. The other looked at the individual records of players from the [[1980–81 Philadelphia 76ers season|1980–81 Philadelphia 76ers]]. The third study analyzed free-throw data and the fourth study was of a controlled shooting experiment. The reason for the different studies was to gradually eliminate external factors around the shot. For example, in the first study there is the factor of how the opposing team's [[Basketball playbook|defensive strategy]] and shot selection would interfere with the shooter. The second and third take out the element of shot selection, and the fourth eliminates the game setting and the distractions and other external factors mentioned before. The studies primarily found that the outcomes of both field goal and free throw attempts are [[independence (probability theory)|independent]] of each other.&lt;ref name="Gilovich1985" /&gt; In the later studies involving the controlled shooting experiment the results were the same; evidently, the researchers concluded that the sense of being "hot" does not predict hits or misses.&lt;ref name="Gilovich1985" /&gt;

=== Proposed explanations ===
Gilovich offers two different explanations for why people believe hot hands exist. The first is that a person may be [[bias]]ed towards looking for streaks before watching a basketball game. This bias would then affect their perceptions and recollection of the game ([[confirmation bias]]). The second explanation deals with people's inability to recognize chance sequences. People expect chance sequences to alternate between the options more than they actually do. Chance sequences can seem too lumpy, and are thus dismissed as non-chance ([[clustering illusion]]).

There are many proposed explanations for why people are susceptible to the hot-hand fallacy. Alan D. Castel, and others investigated the idea that age would alter an individual's belief in the fallacy.&lt;ref name="Castel2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Castel|first=Alan |author2=Drolet Rossi, A. |author3=McGIllivary, S.|title=Beliefs About the "Hot Hand" in Basketball Across the Adult Life Span|journal=Psychology and Agin|volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=601–605 |year=2012|doi=10.1037/a0026991}}&lt;/ref&gt; To test this idea researchers conducted a cross-sectional study where they sampled 455 participants ranging in age from 22 to 90 years old. These participants were given a questionnaire preceded by a prompt that said in college and professional basketball games no players make 100% of their attempted shots.&lt;ref name="Castel2012" /&gt; Then the questionnaire asked two important questions: (1) Does a basketball player have a better chance of making a shot after having just made the last two or three shots than after having missed the last two or three shots? (2) Is it important to pass the ball to someone who has just made several shots in a row?&lt;ref name="Castel2012" /&gt;

The main interest of the questionnaire was to see if a participant answered yes to the first question, implying that they believed in the hot-hand fallacy. The results showed that participants over 70 years of age were twice as likely to believe the fallacy than adults 40–49,&lt;ref name="Castel2012" /&gt; confirming that the older individuals relied more on heuristic-based processes. Older adults are more likely to remember positive information, making them more sensitive to gains and less to losses than younger adults.&lt;ref name="Castel2012" /&gt;

One study looked at the root of the hot-hand fallacy as being from an inability to appropriately judge sequences. The study compiled research from dozens of behavioral and cognitive studies that examined the hot-hand and gambler's fallacies with random mechanisms and skill-generated streaks. In terms of judging random sequences the general conclusion was that people do not have a statistically correct concept of random.&lt;ref name="whats next"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oskarsson|first=Van Boven|title=What's Next? Judging Sequences of Binary Events|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=2009|volume=135|issue=2|pages=262–285|doi=10.1037/a0014821|pmid=19254080}}&lt;/ref&gt; It concluded that human beings are built to see patterns in sensory and conceptual data of all types.&lt;ref name="whats next" /&gt;

=== Follow up studies ===
A 2003 study by Koehler, J. J. &amp; Conley C. A. was conducted to examine the hot hand in professional basketball. In this study the researchers examined film from the NBA shooting contests from 1994–1997. Through studying the film of the contests the researchers hoped to find evidence of sequential dependency within each shooter across all shots. They also searched for sequential dependencies within each shooter per set of 25 continuous shots, and employed a variety of novel techniques for isolating hot performance.&lt;ref name="refmyth"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koehler|first=Jonathan|year=2003|title=The "Hot Hand" Myth in Professional Basketball|journal=Journal of Sport Psychology|volume=2|issue=25|pages=253–259}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the hot hand a player should have very few runs and instead their hits and misses should be in clusters.

In their research there were only two players who had a significantly lower number of runs than expected by chance. No shooter had significantly more runs than would be expected by chance. About half of the shooters (12 of 23 = 52%) had fewer runs than expected, and about half (11 of 23 = 48%) had more runs than expected.&lt;ref name="refmyth" /&gt; The researchers also compared the shooters hits and misses. The data were more in accordance with chance than the hot hand. Through their analysis of the data the conclusion was drawn that there was nothing that supported the hot hand [[hypothesis]].

A study reported that a belief in the hot-hand fallacy affects a player's [[perception]]s of success.&lt;ref name="ref2"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Raab, M., Gula, B., &amp; Gigerenzer, G. (2011) | journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied | volume=18 | pages=81–94 | doi=10.1037/a0025951| year=2012 | last1=Raab | first1=Markus | last2=Gula | first2=Bartosz | last3=Gigerenzer | first3=Gerd }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent research in support of hot hand ==
More recent research has questioned the earlier findings, instead finding support for the belief of a hot hand phenomenon.

A 2003 paper from researchers at [[Monash University]] noted that Gilovich et al. did not examine the [[statistical power]] of their own experiments. By performing power analysis on the 1985 data, the researchers concluded that even if the Philadelphia 76ers did shoot in streaks, it is highly unlikely that Gilovich, Vallone and Tversky would have discovered that fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~korb/iccs.pdf |title=The Story of The Hot Hand: Powerful Myth or Powerless Critique? |first=Kevin B. |last=Korb |first2=Michael |last2=Stillwell |year=2003 |work= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927050854/http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~korb/iccs.pdf |archivedate=2013-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A paper from October 2011 by Yaari and Eisenmann, a large dataset of more than 300,000 NBA free throws were found to show "strong evidence" for the "hot hand" phenomenon at the individual level. They analyzed all free throws taken during five regular NBA seasons from 2005 to 2010. They found that there was a significant increase in players' probabilities of hitting the second shot in a two-shot series compared to the first one. They also found that in a set of two consecutive shots, the probability of hitting the second shot is greater following a hit than following a miss on the previous one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0024532| pmid = 21998630| title = The Hot (Invisible?) Hand: Can Time Sequence Patterns of Success/Failure in Sports Be Modeled as Repeated Random Independent Trials?| journal = PLoS ONE| volume = 6| issue = 10| pages = e24532| year = 2011| last1 = Yaari | first1 = G. | last2 = Eisenmann | first2 = S. | bibcode = 2011PLoSO...624532Y | pmc=3187751}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013, researchers at Stanford University used data from [[Major League Baseball]] and found that there was "strong evidence" that the hot hand existed in ten different statistical categories.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

In 2014, a paper from three Harvard graduates presented at the Sloan Sports Analytics Conference, which used advanced statistics that for the first time could control for variables in basketball games such as the player's shot location and a defender's position, showed a "small yet significant hot-hand effect."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304071004579409071015745370|title=Does the 'Hot Hand' Exist in Basketball?|last=Cohen|first=Ben|date=2014-02-27|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, an examination of the 1985 study by Joshua Miller and Adam Sanjurjo found flaws in the methodology of the 1985 study and showed that, in fact, the hot hands may exist. The researchers said that instead it may be attributable to a misapplication of statistical techniques.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; The authors concluded that people were right to believe that the hot hand exists in basketball.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

== Hot hand in non-sport contexts ==

=== Consumers ===
There are places other than sport that can be affected by the hot-hand fallacy. A study conducted by Joseph Johnson et al. examined the characteristics of an individual's buying and selling behavior as it pertained to the hot hand and gambler's heuristic. Both of these occur when a consumer misunderstands random events in the market and is influenced by a belief that a small sample is able to represent the underlying process.&lt;ref name="Johnson2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Joseph|author2=Tellis, G.J. |author3=Macinnis, D.J. |title=Losers, Winners, and Biased Trades|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|year=2005|volume=2|issue=32|pages=324–329|doi=10.1086/432241}}&lt;/ref&gt; To examine the effect of the hot hand and gambler's heuristic on the buying and selling behaviors of consumers, three hypotheses were made. Hypothesis one stated that consumers that were given stocks with positive and negative trends in earning would be more likely to buy a stock that was positive when it was first getting started but would become less likely to do so as the trend lengthened. Hypothesis two was that consumers would be more likely to sell a stock with negative earnings as the trend length initially increased but would decrease as the trend length increased more. Finally, the third hypothesis was that consumers in the buy condition would be more likely to choose a winning stock over those in the selling condition.&lt;ref name="Johnson2005" /&gt;

The results of the experiment did not support the first hypothesis but did support hypotheses two and three, suggesting that the use of these heuristics is dependent on buying or selling and the length of the sequence.&lt;ref name="Johnson2005" /&gt; This means that those who had the shorter length and the buying condition would fall under the influence of the hot-hand fallacy. The opposite would be in accordance with the [[gambler's fallacy]] which has more of an influence on longer sequences of numerical information.

=== Gambling ===
A study was conducted to examine the difference between the hot-hand and [[gambler's fallacy]]. The gambler's fallacy is the expectation of a reversal following a run of one outcome.&lt;ref name="sympathetic magic"&gt;{{cite journal | title= Roney, C. R., Trick, L. M. (2009)| journal= Sympathetic magic and perceptions of randomness: the hot hand versus the gambler's fallacy | volume= 15 | issue= 2 | pages= 197–210 |doi=10.1080/13546780902847137| year= 2009 | last1= Roney | first1= Christopher J. R. | last2= Trick | first2= Lana M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gambler's fallacy occurs mostly in cases in which people feel that an event is random, such as rolling a pair of dice on a [[craps]] table or spinning the [[roulette]] wheel. It is caused by the false belief that the random numbers of a small sample will balance out the way they do in large samples; this is known as the law of small numbers heuristic. The difference between this and the hot-hand fallacy is that with the hot-hand fallacy an individual expects a run to continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Raab|first=Markus|author2=Gula, B. |author3=Gigerenzer, G. |title=The Hot hand Exists in Volleyball and Is Used for Allocation Decisions|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied|year=2011|volume=18|issue=1|pages=81–94|doi=10.1037/a0025951}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a much larger aspect of the hot hand that relies on the individual. This relates to a person's perceived ability to predict random events, which is not possible for truly random events. The fact that people believe that they have this ability is in line with the [[illusion of control]].&lt;ref name="sympathetic magic" /&gt;

In this study, the researchers wanted to test if they could manipulate a [[Coin flipping|coin toss]], and counter the gambler's fallacy by having the participant focus on the person tossing the coin. In contrast, they attempted to initiate the hot-hand fallacy by centering the participant's focus on the person tossing the coin as a reason for the streak of either heads or tails. In either case the data should fall in line with [[sympathetic magic]], whereby they feel that they can control the outcomes of random events in ways that defy the [[Physical law|laws of physics]], such as being "hot" at tossing a specific randomly determined outcome.&lt;ref name="sympathetic magic" /&gt;

They tested this concept under three different conditions. The first was person focused, where the person who tossed the coin mentioned that ''she'' was tossing a lot of heads or tails. Second was a coin focus, where the person who tossed the coin mentioned that ''the coin'' was coming up with a lot of heads or tails. Finally there was a control condition in which there was nothing said by the person tossing the coin.&lt;ref name="sympathetic magic" /&gt; The participants were also assigned to different groups, one in which the person flipping the coin changed and the other where the person remained the same.

The researchers found the results of this study to match their initial hypothesis that the gambler's fallacy could in fact be countered by the use of the hot hand and people's attention to the person who was actively flipping the coin. It is important to note that this counteraction of the gambler's fallacy only happened if the person tossing the coin remained the same.&lt;ref name="sympathetic magic" /&gt; This study shed light on the idea that the gambler's and hot hand fallacies at times fight for dominance when people try to make predictions about the ''same'' event.&lt;ref name="sympathetic magic" /&gt;

An '''inquisitorial system''' is a [[legal system]] where the [[court]] or a part of the court is actively involved in investigating the facts of the case, as opposed to an [[adversarial system]] where the role of the court is primarily that of an impartial referee between the [[prosecution]] and the [[defendant|defense]]. Inquisitorial systems are used primarily in countries with [[civil law (legal system)|civil legal systems]] as opposed to [[common law]] systems. Countries using common law, including the [[United States]], may use an inquisitorial system for summary hearings in the case of [[misdemeanor]]s such as minor traffic violations. The distinction between an adversarial and inquisitorial system is theoretically unrelated to the distinction between a civil legal and common law system. Some legal scholars consider ''inquisitorial'' misleading, and prefer the word '''nonadversarial'''.&lt;ref&gt;Glendon MA, Carozza PG, Picker CB. (2008) ''Comparative Legal Traditions'', p. 101. Thomson-West.&lt;/ref&gt; The function is often vested in the office of the [[public procurator]], as in [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Germany]], and [[Scotland]].

==Overview==
In an inquisitorial system, the trial judges (mostly plural in serious crimes) are inquisitors who actively participate in fact-finding public inquiry by questioning defense, prosecutors and witnesses. They could even order certain pieces of evidence to be examined if they find presentation by the defense or prosecution to be inadequate.

The inquisitorial system applies to questions of [[criminal procedure]], not [[substantive law]]; that is, it determines how criminal inquiries and trials are conducted, not the kind of crimes for which one can be prosecuted or the sentences that they carry. It is most readily used in some [[civil law (legal system)|civil legal systems]]. However, some jurists do not recognize this dichotomy and see procedure and substantive legal relationships as being interconnected and part of a theory of [[justice]] as applied differently in various legal cultures.

In an [[adversarial system]], judges focus on the issues of [[law]] and [[procedural law|procedure]] and act as a referee in the contest between the [[defendant|defense]] and the [[prosecutor]]. [[Jury|Juries]] decide matters of fact, and [[Jury nullification|sometimes matters of the law]]. Neither [[judge]] nor jury can initiate an inquiry, and judges rarely ask [[witness]]es questions directly during [[trial]]. In some American jurisdictions, it is common practice for jurors to submit questions to the court that they feel were not resolved in [[direct examination|direct]] or [[cross-examination]]. After [[testimony]] and other [[evidence (law)|evidence]] are presented and summarized in arguments, the jury will declare a [[verdict]] (literally: "the spoken truth") and in some jurisdictions the reasoning behind the verdict. However, the discussions among jurors cannot be made public except in extraordinary circumstances.  Appeals on the basis of factual issues, such as sufficiency of the sum total of evidence that was properly admitted, are subject to a [[standard of review]] that is in most jurisdictions heavily deferential to the judgment of the fact-finder at trial, be that a judge or a jury. The failure of a prosecutor to disclose evidence to the defense, for example, or a violation of the defendant's constitutional rights ([[right to counsel|legal representation]], [[right to silence|right to remain silent]], [[right to a fair trial|an open and public trial]]) can trigger a dismissal or [[new trial|re-trial]]. In some adversarial jurisdictions (e.g., the [[United States]]), a prosecutor cannot appeal a [[acquittal|"not guilty" verdict]] (absent corruption or gross [[malfeasance]] by the court).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-7th-circuit/1420701.html|title=FindLaw's United States Seventh Circuit case and opinions.|website=Findlaw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In adversarial systems, the defendant may plead "[[guilt (law)|guilty]]" or "[[nolo contendere|no contest]]" in exchange for reduced sentences, a practice known as [[plea bargain]]ing, which is an extremely common practice in the United States. In theory, the defendant must allocute or "voice" his or her crimes in open court, and the judge must believe the defendant is telling the truth about his or her guilt. In an inquisitorial system, a mere [[confession (law)|confession]] of guilt would not be regarded as ground for a guilty verdict, and the prosecutor is required to provide evidence supporting a guilty verdict; however, this requirement is not unique to inquisitorial systems, as many or most adversarial systems impose a similar requirement under the name ''[[corpus delicti]]''.

==History==
{{see also|Canon law of the Catholic Church|Legal history of the Catholic Church}}
Until the development of the [[Medieval Inquisition]] in the 12th century, the legal systems used in medieval [[Europe]] generally relied on the adversarial system to determine whether someone should be tried and whether a person was guilty or innocent.  Under this system, unless people were caught in the act of committing crimes, they could not be tried until they had been formally accused by their victim, the voluntary accusations of a sufficient number of witnesses, or by an [[inquest]] (an early form of [[grand jury]]) convened specifically for that purpose. A weakness of this system was that because it relied on the voluntary accusations of witnesses, and because the penalties for making a false accusation were severe, victims and would-be witnesses could be hesitant to actually make their accusations to the court, for fear of implicating themselves. Because of the difficulties in deciding cases, procedures such as [[trial by ordeal]] or [[trial by combat|combat]] were accepted.

Beginning in 1198, [[Pope Innocent III]] issued a series of decretals that reformed the ecclesiastical court system.  Under the new {{lang|la|processus per inquisitionem}} (inquisitional procedure) an ecclesiastical magistrate no longer required a formal accusation to summon and try a defendant. Instead, an [[ecclesiastical court]] could summon and interrogate witnesses of its own initiative, and if the (possibly secret) testimony of those witnesses accused a person of a crime, that person could then be summoned and tried. In 1215, the [[Fourth Council of the Lateran]] affirmed the use of the inquisitional system.  The council also forbade clergy from conducting trials by ordeal or combat.  As a result, in parts of continental Europe, the ecclesiastical courts operating under the inquisitional procedure became the dominant method by which disputes were adjudicated. In France, the {{lang|fr|[[parlement]]s}} — lay courts — also employed inquisitorial proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;See:

In England, however, King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] had established separate secular courts during the 1160s.  While the ecclesiastical courts of England, like those on the continent, adopted the inquisitional system, the secular [[common law]] courts continued to operate under the adversarial system.  The adversarial principle that a person could not be tried until formally accused continued to apply for most criminal cases.  In 1215 this principle became enshrined as article 38 of the [[Magna Carta]]: "No bailiff for the future shall, upon his own unsupported complaint, put anyone to his law, without credible witnesses brought for this purposes."

The first territory to wholly adapt the inquisitional system was the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The new [[History of the principle of inquisition in German criminal law|German legal process]] was introduced as part of the {{lang|de|Wormser Reformation}} of 1498 and then the {{lang|la|Constitutio Criminalis Bambergensis}} of 1507.  The adoption of the {{lang|la|[[Constitutio Criminalis Carolina]]}} ({{lang|de|peinliche Gerichtsordnung}} of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]) in 1532 made inquisitional procedures empirical law. It was not until [[Napoleon]] introduced the {{lang|fr|code d'instruction criminelle}} of the French code of criminal procedure on November 16, 1808, that the classical procedures of inquisition were ended in all German territories.

In the development of modern legal institutions which occurred in the 19th century, for the most part jurisdictions did not only codify their [[private law]] and [[criminal law]], but the rules of [[civil procedure]] were reviewed and [[codification (law)|codified]] as well.  It was through this movement that the role of an inquisitorial system became enshrined in most European civilian legal systems. However, there exist significant differences of operating methods and procedures between 18th century {{lang|fr|[[ancien régime]]}} courts and 19th-century courts. In particular, limits on the powers of investigators were typically added, as well as increased rights of the defense.

It would be too much of a generalization to state that the civil law is purely inquisitorial and the common law adversarial. Indeed, the ancient [[Roman law|Roman]] [[custom (law)|custom]] of [[arbitration]] has now been adapted in many common law jurisdictions to a more inquisitorial form. In some mixed civil law systems such as those in [[Scots law|Scotland]], [[Quebec law|Quebec]], and [[Law of Louisiana|Louisiana]], while the substantive law is civil in nature and evolution, the procedural codes that have developed over the last several hundred years are based upon the English adversarial system.

==Modern usage==

===France===
The main feature of the inquisitorial system in [[criminal justice]] in France and other countries functioning along the same lines is the function of the examining or investigating judge (''juge d'instruction''). The examining judge conducts investigations into serious crimes or complex inquiries. As a member of the [[judiciary]], he or she is independent and outside the province of the executive branch, and therefore separate from the Office of Public Prosecutions which is supervised by the [[Minister of Justice (France)|Minister of Justice]].

Despite high media attention and frequent TV portrayals, examining judges are actually active in only a small minority of cases. In 2005, there were 1.1 million criminal rulings in France, while only 33,000 new cases were investigated by judges.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.justice.gouv.fr/art_pix/1_chiffrescles06.pdf Les chiffres-clés de la Justice]'', French Ministry of Justice, October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority of cases are therefore investigated directly by law enforcement agencies ([[French National Police|police]], [[French Gendarmerie|gendarmerie]]) under the supervision of the Office of Public Prosecutions (''procureurs'').

Examining judges are used for serious crimes, e.g., [[murder]] and [[rape]], and for crimes involving complexity, such as [[embezzlement]], misuse of public funds, and [[political corruption|corruption]]. The case may be brought before the examining judge either by the public prosecutor (''procureur'') or, more rarely, by the victim (who may compel an ''instruction'' even if the public prosecutor rules the charges to be insufficient).

The judge questions witnesses, interrogates suspects, and orders [[search warrant|search]]es for other investigations. Their role is not to prosecute the accused, but to gather facts, and as such their duty is to look for any and all [[evidence (law)|evidence]] (''à charge et à décharge''), incriminating or exculpatory. Both the [[prosecution]] and the [[defense (legal)|defense]] may request the judge to act and may appeal the judge's decisions before an appellate court. The scope of the inquiry is limited by the mandate given by the prosecutor's office:  the examining judge cannot open a criminal investigation [[sua sponte]].

In the past the examining judge could order committal of the accused, this power being subject to appeal. However, this is no longer the case, and other judges have to approve a committal order.

If the examining judge decides there is a valid case against a suspect, the accused is sent for adversarial trial by jury. The examining judge does not sit on the trial court which tries the case and is in fact prohibited from sitting for future cases involving the same defendant. The case is tried before the court in a manner similar to that of adversarial courts: the prosecution (and on occasion a plaintiff) seeks the conviction of accused criminals, the defense attempts to rebut the prosecution claims, and the [[judge]] and [[jury]] draw their conclusions from the evidence presented at trial.

As a result of judicial investigation and defendants being able to have judicial proceedings dismissed on procedural grounds during the examining phase, cases where the evidence is weak tend not to reach the trial stage. Conversely, the guilty [[plea]] and [[plea bargain]]ing were until recently unknown to French law, and now it only applies to crimes for which the prosecution seeks a sentence not exceeding one year imprisonment. Therefore, most cases go to trial, including cases where the prosecution is almost sure to gain a conviction, whereas, in countries such as the United States, these would be settled by plea bargain.

In [[administrative law|administrative court]]s such as the [[Council of State (France)|Council of State]], litigation proceedings are markedly more inquisitorial. Most of the procedure is conducted in writing; the plaintiff writes to the court, which asks explanations from the administration or public service concerned; when answered, the court may then ask further detail from the plaintiff, etc. When the case is sufficiently complete, the lawsuit opens in court; however, the parties are not even required to attend the court appearance. This method reflects the fact that administrative lawsuits are for the most part about matters of formal procedure and technicalities.

===Inquisitorial tribunals within the United States===
Certain administrative proceedings within some common law jurisdictions in the United States may be similar to their civil law counterparts but are conducted on a more inquisitorial model. For instance tribunals dealing with minor traffic violations at the [[New York City Traffic Violations Bureau]] are held before an adjudicator who also functions as a prosecutor. They question witnesses before rendering judgements and setting fines.

These types of tribunals or boards function as an expedited form of justice where the state agents conduct an initial investigation and the adjudicator's job is to confirm these preliminary findings through a simplified form of procedure that grants some basic amount of [[due process]] or [[fundamental justice]] in which the accused party has an opportunity to place his or her objections on the record.

In Hindu philosophy, '''Jagra''' is one of the four states of consciousness a man (or a being) can have. It can be roughly translated as "wakefulness". It is that part of consciousness when a person or being can sense this physical universe. Other states of consciousness are [[Swapna-marga|swapna]], [[susupti]] and [[turiya]]. Later commentators increased the states of consciousness from four to seven.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2132">'''Learned intermediary''' is a defense doctrine used in the legal system of the [[United States]].  This doctrine states that a manufacturer of a product has fulfilled his duty of care when he provides all of the necessary information to a "learned intermediary" who then interacts with the consumer of a product. This doctrine is primarily used by pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers in defense of [[tort]] suits. 

In a clear majority of states, the courts have accepted this as a liability shield for pharmaceutical companies. 

This doctrine was adopted by the Supreme Court of Canada in ''Hollis v Dow Corning Corp.'', 129 DLR 609 (1995).

==History==
The use of the term "learned intermediary" was first used in the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] decision of ''Sterling Drug v. Cornish'' (370 F.2d 82, 85), in 1966, and has now become the prevailing doctrine in the majority of jurisdictions in the United States.

==Dissent==
Recently, this doctrine has been called into question due to the increased use of [[Direct-to-consumer advertising|direct to consumer advertising]], whereby drug manufacturers market pharmaceutical products to individuals rather than to doctors. For example, in ''Rimbert v. Eli Lilly &amp; Co.'', 577 F. Supp. 2d 1174, 1218-19 (D. N.M. 2008), the District Court of New Mexico reasoned that the "dramatically increased marketing directed to consumers . . . would persuade the Supreme Court of New Mexico that the justification for the learned-intermediary doctrine is quickly becoming, if not already the case, outdated." However, other recent cases have declined to adopt this so-called "direct-to-consumer advertising" exception to the learned intermediary doctrine. ''See  DiBartolo v. Abbott Labs.'', 2012 WL 6681704 (S.D.N.Y. Dec.21, 2012),  ''Centocor Inc. v. Hamilton'', 372 S.W.3d 140, 161 (Tex. 2012), ''Calisi v. Abbott Labs.'', 2013 WL 5462274 (D. Mass. Feb. 25, 2013).

'''Leuckart's law''' is an [[empirical law]] in [[zoology]] that states that the size of the eye of an animal is related to its maximum speed of movement; fast-moving animals have larger eyes, after allowing for the effects of [[body mass]]. The hypothesis dates from 1876,&lt;ref name=hugh/&gt; and in older literature is usually referred to as '''Leuckart's ratio'''.&lt;ref name=stew/&gt;

The principle was initially applied to birds; it has also been applied to mammals.&lt;ref name=heard/&gt;

==Criticism==
A study of 88 bird species, published in 2011, found no useful correlation between flight speed and eye size.&lt;ref name=hall/&gt;

In [[physics]] (particularly in [[electromagnetism]]) the '''Lorentz force''' (or '''electromagnetic force''') is the combination of electric and magnetic [[force]] on a [[point charge]] due to [[electromagnetic field]]s. A particle of charge ''q'' moving with a velocity ''v'' in an [[electric field]] '''E''' and a [[magnetic field]] '''B''' experiences a force
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = q\mathbf{E} + q\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;
(in [[International System of Units|SI units]]&lt;ref name=units&gt;In SI units, {{math|'''B'''}} is measured in [[tesla (unit)|teslas]] (symbol: T). In [[Gaussian units|Gaussian-cgs units]], {{math|'''B'''}} is measured in [[gauss (unit)|gauss]] (symbol: G). See e.g. {{cite web |url=http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/faqgeom.shtml |title=Geomagnetism Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=National Geophysical Data Center |accessdate=21 October 2013}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=units2&gt;The {{math|'''H'''}}-field is measured in [[ampere]]s per metre (A/m) in SI units, and in [[oersted]]s (Oe) in cgs units. {{cite web|title=International system of units (SI) |url=http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/units.html |work=NIST reference on constants, units, and uncertainty |publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology |accessdate=9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Variations on this basic formula describe the magnetic force on a current-carrying wire (sometimes called [[#Force on a current-carrying wire|Laplace force]]), the [[electromotive force]] in a wire loop moving through a magnetic field (an aspect of [[Faraday's law of induction]]), and the force on a charged particle which might be traveling near the [[speed of light]] ([[special relativity|relativistic]] form of the Lorentz force).

The first derivation of the Lorentz force is commonly attributed to [[Oliver Heaviside]] in 1889,&lt;ref name=Nahin/&gt; although other historians suggest an earlier origin in an 1865 paper by [[James Clerk Maxwell]].&lt;ref name=Huray/&gt; [[Hendrik Lorentz]] derived it in 1895,&lt;ref name=Dahl/&gt; a few years after Heaviside.

==Equation==

===Charged particle===

[[File:Lorentz force particle.svg|200px|thumb|Lorentz force '''F''' on a [[charged particle]] (of charge ''q'') in motion (instantaneous velocity '''v'''). The [[electric field|'''E''' field]] and [[magnetic field|'''B''' field]] vary in space and time.]]

The force '''F''' acting on a particle of [[electric charge]] ''q'' with instantaneous velocity '''v''', due to an external electric field '''E''' and magnetic field '''B''', is given by (in [[SI units]]&lt;ref name=units/&gt;):&lt;ref name=Jackson2/&gt;

{{Equation box 1
|indent =:
|equation = &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = q(\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B})&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding
|border
|border colour = #50C878
|background colour = #ECFCF4}}

where &lt;big&gt;×&lt;/big&gt; is the vector cross product (all boldface quantities are vectors). In terms of cartesian components, we have:

&lt;math&gt;F_x = q (E_x + v_y B_z - v_z B_y),&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;F_y = q (E_y + v_z B_x - v_x B_z),&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;F_z = q (E_z + v_x B_y - v_y B_x).&lt;/math&gt;

In general, the electric and magnetic fields are functions of the position and time. Therefore, explicitly, the Lorentz force can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{\dot{r}},t,q) = q[\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r},t) + \mathbf{\dot{r}} \times \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r},t)]&lt;/math&gt;

in which '''r''' is the position vector of the charged particle, ''t'' is time, and the overdot is a time derivative.

A positively charged particle will be accelerated in the ''same'' linear orientation as the '''E''' field, but will curve perpendicularly to both the instantaneous velocity vector '''v''' and the '''B''' field according to the [[right-hand rule]] (in detail, if the fingers of the right hand are extended to point in the direction of '''v''' and are then curled to point in the direction of '''B''', then the extended thumb will point in the direction of '''F''').

The term ''q'''''E''' is called the '''electric force''', while the term ''q'''''v''' &lt;big&gt;×&lt;/big&gt; '''B''' is called the '''magnetic force'''.&lt;ref name=Griffiths1&gt;See Griffiths, page 204.&lt;/ref&gt; According to some definitions, the term "Lorentz force" refers specifically to the formula for the magnetic force,&lt;ref name=Griffiths2&gt;For example, see the [http://ilorentz.org/history/lorentz/lorentz.html website of the Lorentz Institute] or Griffiths.&lt;/ref&gt; with the ''total'' electromagnetic force (including the electric force) given some other (nonstandard) name. This article will ''not'' follow this nomenclature: In what follows, the term "Lorentz force" will refer to the expression for the total force.

The magnetic force component of the Lorentz force manifests itself as the force that acts on a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field. In that context, it is also called the [[#Force on a current-carrying wire|Laplace force]].

The Lorentz force is a force exerted by the electromagnetic field on the charged particle, that is, it is the rate at which linear momentum is transferred from the electromagnetic field to the particle. Associated with it is the power which is the rate at which energy is transferred from the electromagnetic field to the particle. That power is
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{F} = q \, \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{E}&lt;/math&gt;.
Notice that the magnetic field does not contribute to the power because the magnetic force is always perpendicular to the velocity of the particle.

===Continuous charge distribution===

[[File:Lorentz force continuum.svg|200px|thumb|Lorentz force (per unit 3-volume) '''f''' on a continuous [[charge distribution]] ([[charge density]] ρ) in motion. The 3-[[current density]] '''J''' corresponds to the motion of the charge element ''dq'' in [[volume element]] ''dV'' and varies throughout the continuum.]]

For a continuous [[charge distribution]] in motion, the Lorentz force equation becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}\mathbf{F} = \mathrm{d}q\left(\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}\right)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where ''d'''''F''' is the force on a small piece of the charge distribution with charge ''dq''. If both sides of this equation are divided by the volume of this small piece of the charge distribution ''dV'', the result is:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f} = \rho\left(\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}\right)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where '''f''' is the ''force density'' (force per unit volume) and ''ρ'' is the [[charge density]] (charge per unit volume). Next, the [[current density]] corresponding to the motion of the charge continuum is

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J} = \rho \mathbf{v} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

so the continuous analogue to the equation is&lt;ref name="Electrodynamics 1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Griffiths|first=David J.|title=Introduction to electrodynamics|year=1999|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-13-805326-0|edition=3rd |others= reprint. with corr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The total force is the [[volume integral]] over the charge distribution:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} = \iiint \! ( \rho \mathbf{E} + \mathbf{J} \times \mathbf{B} )\,\mathrm{d}V. \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

By eliminating ρ and '''J''', using [[Maxwell's equations]], and manipulating using the theorems of [[vector calculus]], this form of the equation can be used to derive the [[Maxwell stress tensor]] '''σ''', in turn this can be combined with the [[Poynting vector]] '''S''' to obtain the [[electromagnetic stress–energy tensor]] '''T''' used in [[general relativity]].&lt;ref name="Electrodynamics 1999"/&gt;

In terms of '''σ''' and '''S''', another way to write the Lorentz force (per unit volume) is&lt;ref name="Electrodynamics 1999"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{f} = \nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{\sigma} - \dfrac{1}{c^2} \dfrac{\partial \mathbf{S}}{\partial t}  \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where ''c'' is the [[speed of light]] and [[Nabla symbol|∇]]· denotes the divergence of a [[tensor field]]. Rather than the amount of charge and its velocity in electric and magnetic fields, this equation relates the [[energy flux]] (flow of ''energy'' per unit time per unit distance) in the fields to the force exerted on a charge distribution. See [[Covariant formulation of classical electromagnetism#Charge continuum|Covariant formulation of classical electromagnetism]] for more details.

The density of power associated with the Lorentz force in a material medium is
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J} \cdot \mathbf{E}&lt;/math&gt;.

If we separate the total charge and total current into their free and bound parts, we get that the density of the Lorentz force is
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f} = (\rho_f - \nabla \cdot \mathbf P) \mathbf{E} + (\mathbf{J}_f + \nabla\times\mathbf{M} + \frac{\partial\mathbf{P}}{\partial t}) \times \mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;.

where: &amp;rho;&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; is the density of free charge; ''P'' is the [[polarization density]]; ''J''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; is the density of free current; and ''M'' is the [[magnetization]] density. In this way, the Lorentz force can explain the torque applied to a permanent magnet by the magnetic field. The density of the associated power is
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\mathbf{J}_f + \nabla\times\mathbf{M} + \frac{\partial\mathbf{P}}{\partial t}\right) \cdot \mathbf{E}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Equation in cgs units===
The above-mentioned formulae use [[SI units]] which are the most common among experimentalists, technicians, and engineers. In [[Gaussian units|cgs-Gaussian units]], which are somewhat more common among theoretical physicists as well as condensed matter experimentalists, one has instead
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = q_\mathrm{cgs} \left(\mathbf{E}_\mathrm{cgs} + \frac{\mathbf{v}}{c} \times \mathbf{B}_\mathrm{cgs}\right).&lt;/math&gt;
where ''c'' is the [[speed of light]]. 
Although this equation looks slightly different, it is completely equivalent, since
one has the following relations:&lt;ref name=units/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;q_\mathrm{cgs}=\frac{q_\mathrm{SI}}{\sqrt{4\pi \epsilon_0}},\quad \mathbf E_\mathrm{cgs} =\sqrt{4\pi\epsilon_0}\,\mathbf E_\mathrm{SI},\quad \mathbf B_\mathrm{cgs} ={\sqrt{4\pi /\mu_0}}\,{\mathbf B_\mathrm{SI}},\quad c=\frac{1}{\sqrt{ \epsilon_0\mu_0}}.&lt;/math&gt;

where ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[vacuum permittivity]] and μ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; the [[vacuum permeability]]. In practice, the subscripts "cgs" and "SI" are always omitted, and the unit system has to be assessed from context.

[[J. J. Thomson]] was the first to attempt to derive from Maxwell's field equations the electromagnetic forces on a moving charged object in terms of the object's properties and external fields. Interested in determining the electromagnetic behavior of the charged particles in [[cathode ray]]s, Thomson published a paper in 1881 wherein he gave the force on the particles due to an external magnetic field as&lt;ref name=Nahin&gt;Paul J.

Thomson derived the correct basic form of the formula, but, because of some miscalculations and an incomplete description of the [[displacement current]], included an incorrect scale-factor of a half in front of the formula.  [[Oliver Heaviside]] invented the modern vector notation and applied it to Maxwell's field equations; he also (in 1885 and 1889) had fixed the mistakes of Thomson's derivation and arrived at the correct form of the magnetic force on a moving charged object.&lt;ref name=Nahin/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

In many cases of practical interest, the motion in a [[magnetic field]] of an [[electric charge|electrically charged]] particle (such as an [[electron]] or [[ion]] in a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]) can be treated as the [[Quantum superposition|superposition]] of a relatively fast circular motion around a point called the '''guiding center''' and a relatively slow '''drift''' of this point. The drift speeds may differ for various species depending on their charge states, masses, or temperatures, possibly resulting in electric currents or chemical separation.

==Significance of the Lorentz force==

While the modern Maxwell's equations describe how electrically charged particles and currents or moving charged particles give rise to electric and magnetic fields, the Lorentz force law completes that picture by describing the force acting on a moving point charge ''q'' in the presence of electromagnetic fields.&lt;ref name=Jackson2&gt;See Jackson, page 2. The book lists the four modern Maxwell's equations, and then states, "Also essential for consideration of charged particle motion is the Lorentz force equation, '''F''' = ''q'' ('''E'''+ '''v &lt;big&gt;×&lt;/big&gt; B'''), which gives the force acting on a point charge ''q'' in the presence of electromagnetic fields."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Griffiths50&gt;See Griffiths, page 326, which states that Maxwell's equations, "together with the [Lorentz] force law...summarize the entire theoretical content of classical electrodynamics".&lt;/ref&gt; The Lorentz force law describes the effect of '''E''' and '''B''' upon a point charge, but such electromagnetic forces are not the entire picture. Charged particles are possibly coupled to other forces, notably gravity and nuclear forces. Thus, Maxwell's equations do not stand separate from other physical laws, but are coupled to them via the charge and current densities. The response of a point charge to the Lorentz law is one aspect; the generation of '''E''' and '''B''' by currents and charges is another.

In real materials the Lorentz force is inadequate to describe the collective behavior of charged particles, both in principle and as a matter of computation. The charged particles in a material medium not only respond to the '''E''' and '''B''' fields but also generate these fields. Complex transport equations must be solved to determine the time and spatial response of charges, for example, the [[Boltzmann equation]] or the [[Fokker–Planck equation]] or the [[Navier–Stokes equations]]. For example, see [[magnetohydrodynamics]], [[fluid dynamics]], [[electrohydrodynamics]], [[superconductivity]], [[stellar evolution]]. An entire physical apparatus for dealing with these matters has developed. See for example, [[Green–Kubo relations]] and [[Green's function (many-body theory)]].

==Lorentz force law as the definition of E and B==

In many textbook treatments of classical electromagnetism, the Lorentz force Law is used as the ''definition'' of the electric and magnetic fields '''E''' and '''B'''.&lt;ref name=Jackson20&gt;See, for example, Jackson, pp. 777–8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gravitation|author1=J.A. Wheeler |author2=C. Misner |author3=K.S. Thorne |publisher=W.H. Freeman &amp; Co|year=1973|pages=72–73|isbn=0-7167-0344-0}}. These authors use the Lorentz force in tensor form as definer of the [[electromagnetic tensor]] ''F'', in turn the fields '''E''' and '''B'''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Electromagnetism|edition=2nd|author1=I.S. Grant |author2=W.R. Phillips |author3=Manchester Physics |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=1990|page=122|isbn=978-0-471-92712-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; To be specific, the Lorentz force is understood to be the following empirical statement:

:''The electromagnetic force '''F''' on a [[test charge]] at a given point and time is a certain function of its charge ''q'' and velocity '''v''', which can be parameterized by exactly two vectors '''E''' and '''B''', in the functional form'':

::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}=q(\mathbf{E}+\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B})&lt;/math&gt;

This is valid, even for particles approaching the speed of light (that is, [[Norm (mathematics)#Euclidean norm|magnitude]] of '''v''' = |'''v'''| ≈ ''c'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Electromagnetism (2nd Edition)|author1=I.S. Grant |author2=W.R. Phillips |author3=Manchester Physics |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=1990|page=123|isbn=978-0-471-92712-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; So the two [[vector field]]s '''E''' and '''B''' are thereby defined throughout space and time, and these are called the "electric field" and "magnetic field". The fields are defined everywhere in space and time with respect to what force a test charge would receive regardless of whether a charge is present to experience the force.

As a definition of '''E''' and '''B''', the Lorentz force is only a definition in principle because a real particle (as opposed to the hypothetical "test charge" of infinitesimally-small mass and charge) would generate its own finite '''E''' and '''B''' fields, which would alter the electromagnetic force that it experiences. In addition, if the charge experiences acceleration, as if forced into a curved trajectory by some external agency, it emits radiation that causes braking of its motion. See for example [[Bremsstrahlung]] and [[synchrotron light]]. These effects occur through both a direct effect (called the [[Abraham–Lorentz force|radiation reaction force]]) and indirectly (by affecting the motion of nearby charges and currents). Moreover, net force must include [[gravity]], [[Electroweak interaction|electroweak]], and any other forces aside from electromagnetic force.

==Force on a current-carrying wire==
[[File:Regla mano derecha Laplace.svg|right|thumb|250px|Right-hand rule for a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field ''B'']]
When a wire carrying an electric current is placed in a magnetic field, each of the moving charges, which comprise the current, experiences the Lorentz force, and together they can create a macroscopic force on the wire (sometimes called the '''Laplace force'''). By combining the Lorentz force law above with the definition of electric current, the following equation results, in the case of a straight, stationary wire:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.physicsexperiment.co.uk/content/bil.html|title=Physics Experiments|website=www.physicsexperiment.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = I \boldsymbol{\ell} \times \mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;

where '''ℓ''' is a vector whose magnitude is the length of wire, and whose direction is along the wire, aligned with the direction of [[conventional current]] flow ''I''.

If the wire is not straight but curved, the force on it can be computed by applying this formula to each [[infinitesimal]] segment of wire ''d'''''ℓ''', then adding up all these forces by [[integration (calculus)|integration]]. Formally, the net force on a stationary, rigid wire carrying a steady current ''I'' is

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = I\int \mathrm{d}\boldsymbol{\ell}\times \mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;

This is the net force. In addition, there will usually be [[torque]], plus other effects if the wire is not perfectly rigid.

One application of this is [[Ampère's force law]], which describes how two current-carrying wires can attract or repel each other, since each experiences a Lorentz force from the other's magnetic field. For more information, see the article: [[Ampère's force law]].

==EMF==

The magnetic force ({{nowrap|''q'''''v''' × '''B'''}}) component of the Lorentz force is responsible for ''motional'' [[electromotive force]] (or ''motional EMF''), the phenomenon underlying many electrical generators. When a conductor is moved through a magnetic field, the magnetic field exerts opposite forces on electrons and nuclei in the wire, and this creates the EMF. The term "motional EMF" is applied to this phenomenon, since the EMF is due to the ''motion'' of the wire.

In other electrical generators, the magnets move, while the conductors do not. In this case, the EMF is due to the electric force (''q'''''E''') term in the Lorentz Force equation. The electric field in question is created by the changing magnetic field, resulting in an ''induced'' EMF, as described by the [[Electromagnetic induction#Maxwell–Faraday equation|Maxwell–Faraday equation]] (one of the four modern [[Maxwell's equations]]).&lt;ref name=Griffiths302&gt;See Griffiths, pages 301–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both of these EMFs, despite their apparently distinct origins, are described by the same equation, namely, the EMF is the rate of change of [[magnetic flux]] through the wire. (This is Faraday's law of induction, see [[Lorentz force#Lorentz force and Faraday.27s law of induction|below]].) Einstein's [[special theory of relativity]] was partially motivated by the desire to better understand this link between the two effects.&lt;ref name=Griffiths302/&gt; In fact, the electric and magnetic fields are different facets of the same electromagnetic field, and in moving from one inertial frame to another, the [[solenoidal vector field]] portion of the ''E''-field can change in whole or in part to a ''B''-field or ''vice versa''.&lt;ref name=Chow&gt;

[[File:LeidenLorentz1.jpg|{{largethumb}}|Lorentz force -image on a wall in Leiden]]
{{main|Faraday's law of induction}}

Given a loop of wire in a [[magnetic field]], Faraday's law of induction states the induced [[electromotive force]] (EMF) in the wire is:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E} = -\frac{\mathrm{d}\Phi_B}{\mathrm{d}t}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt; \Phi_B = \iint_{\Sigma(t)} \mathrm{d} \mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r}, t)&lt;/math&gt;

is the [[magnetic flux]] through the loop, '''B''' is the magnetic field, Σ(''t'') is a surface bounded by the closed contour ∂Σ(''t''), at all at time ''t'', d'''A''' is an infinitesimal [[vector area]] element of Σ(''t'') (magnitude is the area of an infinitesimal patch of surface, direction is [[orthogonal]] to that surface patch).

The ''sign'' of the EMF is determined by [[Lenz's law]]. Note that this is valid for not only a ''stationary'' wire{{snd}}but also for a ''moving'' wire.

From [[Faraday's law of induction]] (that is valid for a moving wire, for instance in a motor) and the [[Maxwell Equations]], the Lorentz Force can be deduced. The reverse is also true, the Lorentz force and the [[Maxwell Equations]] can be used to derive the [[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday Law]].

Let Σ(''t'') be the moving wire, moving together without rotation and with constant velocity '''v''' and Σ(''t'') be the internal surface of the wire. The EMF around the closed path ∂Σ(''t'') is given by:&lt;ref name=Landau&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E} =\oint_{\partial \Sigma (t)} \mathrm{d} \boldsymbol{\ell} \cdot \mathbf{F} / q&lt;/math&gt;

where

NB: Both d'''ℓ''' and d'''A''' have a sign ambiguity; to get the correct sign, the [[right-hand rule]] is used, as explained in the article [[Kelvin–Stokes theorem]].

The above result can be compared with the version of Faraday's law of induction that appears in the modern Maxwell's equations, called here the ''Maxwell–Faraday equation'':

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} \ .&lt;/math&gt;

The Maxwell–Faraday equation also can be written in an ''integral form'' using the [[Kelvin–Stokes theorem]].&lt;ref name=Harrington&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

So we have, the Maxwell Faraday equation:

:&lt;math&gt; \oint_{\partial \Sigma(t)}\mathrm{d} \boldsymbol{\ell} \cdot \mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r},\ t) = - \  \iint_{\Sigma(t)}  \mathrm{d} \mathbf {A} \cdot {{\mathrm{d} \,\mathbf {B}(\mathbf{r},\ t)} \over \mathrm{d}t } &lt;/math&gt;

and the Faraday Law,

:&lt;math&gt; \oint_{\partial \Sigma(t)}\mathrm{d} \boldsymbol{\ell} \cdot \mathbf{F}/q(\mathbf{r},\ t) = - \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}  \iint_{\Sigma(t)}  \mathrm{d} \mathbf {A} \cdot \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r},\ t). &lt;/math&gt;

The two are equivalent if the wire is not moving. Using the [[Leibniz integral rule]] and that ''div'' '''B''' = 0, results in,

:&lt;math&gt; \oint_{\partial \Sigma(t)} \mathrm{d} \boldsymbol{\ell} \cdot \mathbf{F}/q(\mathbf{r}, t) = 
- \iint_{\Sigma(t)}  \mathrm{d} \mathbf{A} \cdot \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r}, t) +
\oint_{\partial \Sigma(t)} \!\!\!\!\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B} \,\mathrm{d} \boldsymbol{\ell}
&lt;/math&gt;

and using the Maxwell Faraday equation,

:&lt;math&gt; \oint_{\partial \Sigma(t)} \mathrm{d} \boldsymbol{\ell} \cdot \mathbf{F}/q(\mathbf{r},\ t) = 
\oint_{\partial \Sigma(t)} \mathrm{d} \boldsymbol{\ell} \cdot \mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r},\ t)  +
\oint_{\partial \Sigma(t)}\!\!\!\! \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r},\ t)\, \mathrm{d} \boldsymbol{\ell}
&lt;/math&gt;

since this is valid for any wire position it implies that,

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F}= q\,\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r},\ t)  + q\,\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r},\ t).&lt;/math&gt;

Faraday's law of induction holds whether the loop of wire is rigid and stationary, or in motion or in process of deformation, and it holds whether the magnetic field is constant in time or changing. However, there are cases where Faraday's law is either inadequate or difficult to use, and application of the underlying Lorentz force law is necessary. See [[Faraday paradox#Inapplicability of Faraday's law|inapplicability of Faraday's law]].

If the magnetic field is fixed in time and the conducting loop moves through the field, the magnetic flux Φ&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; linking the loop can change in several ways. For example, if the '''B'''-field varies with position, and the loop moves to a location with different '''B'''-field, Φ&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; will change. Alternatively, if the loop changes orientation with respect to the '''B'''-field, the {{nowrap|'''B''' &amp;sdot; d'''A'''}} differential element will change because of the different angle between '''B''' and d'''A''', also changing Φ&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;. As a third example, if a portion of the circuit is swept through a uniform, time-independent '''B'''-field, and another portion of the circuit is held stationary, the flux linking the entire closed circuit can change due to the shift in relative position of the circuit's component parts with time (surface ∂Σ(''t'') time-dependent). In all three cases, Faraday's law of induction then predicts the EMF generated by the change in Φ&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;.

Note that the Maxwell Faraday's equation implies that the Electric Field '''E''' is non conservative when the Magnetic Field '''B''' varies in time, and is not expressible as the gradient of a [[scalar field]], and not subject to the [[gradient theorem]] since its rotational is not zero.&lt;ref name="Landau"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Lorentz force in terms of potentials==

{{see also|Mathematical descriptions of the electromagnetic field|Maxwell's equations|Helmholtz decomposition}}

The '''E''' and '''B''' fields can be replaced by the [[magnetic vector potential]] '''A''' and ([[Scalar (mathematics)|scalar]]) [[electrostatic potential]] ''ϕ''  by

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{E} = - \nabla \phi - \frac { \partial \mathbf{A} } { \partial t }&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B} = \nabla \times \mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;

where ∇ is the gradient, ∇⋅ is the divergence, ∇× is the [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]].

The force becomes

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = q\left[-\nabla \phi- \frac{\partial \mathbf{A}}{\partial t}+\mathbf{v}\times(\nabla\times\mathbf{A})\right]&lt;/math&gt;

and using an [[Triple product#Vector triple product|identity for the triple product]] simplifies to

{{Equation box 1
|indent =:
|equation = &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = q\left[-\nabla \phi- \frac{\partial \mathbf{A}}{\partial t}+ \nabla (\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{A})-(\mathbf{v}\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{A} \right]&lt;/math&gt;

('''v''' has no dependence on position, so there's no need to use [[Vector calculus identities#Special notations|Feynman's subscript notation]]). Using the chain rule, the [[total derivative]] of '''A''' is:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{A}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{\partial\mathbf{A}}{\partial t}+(\mathbf{v}\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{A} &lt;/math&gt;

so the above expression can be rewritten as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = q\left[-\nabla (\phi-\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{A})- \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{A}}{\mathrm{d}t}\right]&lt;/math&gt;.

With '''v''' = '''ẋ''', we can put the equation into the convenient Euler–Lagrange form

{{Equation box 1
|indent =:
|equation = &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = q\left[-\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}(\phi-\dot{\mathbf{x}}\cdot\mathbf{A})+ \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\nabla_{\dot{\mathbf{x}}}(\phi-\dot{\mathbf{x}}\cdot\mathbf{A})\right]&lt;/math&gt;

where

&lt;math&gt;\nabla_{\mathbf{x}} = \hat{x} \dfrac{\partial}{\partial x} + \hat{y} \dfrac{\partial}{\partial y} + \hat{z} \dfrac{\partial}{\partial z}&lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt;\nabla_{\dot{\mathbf{x}}} = \hat{x} \dfrac{\partial}{\partial \dot{x}} + \hat{y} \dfrac{\partial}{\partial \dot{y}} + \hat{z} \dfrac{\partial}{\partial \dot{z}}&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] for a charged particle of mass ''m'' and charge ''q'' in an electromagnetic field equivalently describes the dynamics of the particle in terms of its ''energy'', rather than the force exerted on it. The classical expression is given by:&lt;ref&gt;Classical Mechanics (2nd Edition), T.W.B. Kibble, European Physics Series, McGraw Hill (UK), 1973, {{ISBN|0-07-084018-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;L=\frac{m}{2}\mathbf{\dot{r}}\cdot\mathbf{\dot{r}}+q\mathbf{A}\cdot\mathbf{\dot{r}}-q\phi&lt;/math&gt;

where '''A''' and ''ϕ'' are the potential fields as above. Using [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrange's equations]], the equation for the Lorentz force can be obtained.

|For an '''A''' field, a particle moving with velocity '''v''' = '''ṙ''' has [[potential momentum]] &lt;math&gt;q\mathbf{A}(\mathbf{r},t)&lt;/math&gt;, so its potential energy is &lt;math&gt;q\mathbf{A}(\mathbf{r},t)\cdot\mathbf{\dot{r}}&lt;/math&gt;. For a ''ϕ'' field, the particle's potential energy is &lt;math&gt;q\phi(\mathbf{r},t)&lt;/math&gt;.

The total [[potential energy]] is then:

:&lt;math&gt;V=q\phi-q\mathbf{A}\cdot\mathbf{\dot{r}}&lt;/math&gt;

and the [[kinetic energy]] is:

:&lt;math&gt;T=\frac{m}{2}\mathbf{\dot{r}}\cdot\mathbf{\dot{r}}&lt;/math&gt;

hence the Lagrangian:

:&lt;math&gt;L=T-V=\frac{m}{2}\mathbf{\dot{r}}\cdot\mathbf{\dot{r}}+q\mathbf{A}\cdot\mathbf{\dot{r}}-q\phi&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;L=\frac{m}{2}(\dot{x}^2+\dot{y}^2+\dot{z}^2) + q(\dot{x}A_x+\dot{y}A_y+\dot{z}A_z) - q\phi&lt;/math&gt;

Lagrange's equations are

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{x}}=\frac{\partial L}{\partial x}&lt;/math&gt;

(same for ''y'' and ''z''). So calculating the partial derivatives:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{x}} &amp; =m\ddot{x}+q\frac{\mathrm{d} A_x}{\mathrm{d}t} \\
&amp; = m\ddot{x}+ \frac{q}{\mathrm{d}t}\left(\frac{\partial A_x}{\partial t}dt+\frac{\partial A_x}{\partial x}dx+\frac{\partial A_x}{\partial y}dy+\frac{\partial A_x}{\partial z}dz\right) \\
&amp; = m\ddot{x}+ q\left(\frac{\partial A_x}{\partial t}+\frac{\partial A_x}{\partial x}\dot{x}+\frac{\partial A_x}{\partial y}\dot{y}+\frac{\partial A_x}{\partial z}\dot{z}\right)\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial L}{\partial x}= -q\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x}+ q\left(\frac{\partial A_x}{\partial x}\dot{x}+\frac{\partial A_y}{\partial x}\dot{y}+\frac{\partial A_z}{\partial x}\dot{z}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

equating and simplifying:

:&lt;math&gt;m\ddot{x}+ q\left(\frac{\partial A_x}{\partial t}+\frac{\partial A_x}{\partial x}\dot{x}+\frac{\partial A_x}{\partial y}\dot{y}+\frac{\partial A_x}{\partial z}\dot{z}\right)= -q\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x}+ q\left(\frac{\partial A_x}{\partial x}\dot{x}+\frac{\partial A_y}{\partial x}\dot{y}+\frac{\partial A_z}{\partial x}\dot{z}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} F_x &amp; = -q\left(\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial A_x}{\partial t}\right) + q\left[\dot{y}\left(\frac{\partial A_y}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial A_x}{\partial y}\right)+\dot{z}\left(\frac{\partial A_z}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial A_x}{\partial z}\right)\right] \\
&amp; = qE_x + q[\dot{y}(\nabla\times\mathbf{A})_z-\dot{z}(\nabla\times\mathbf{A})_y] \\
&amp; = qE_x + q[\mathbf{\dot{r}}\times(\nabla\times\mathbf{A})]_x \\
&amp; = qE_x + q(\mathbf{\dot{r}}\times\mathbf{B})_x
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

and similarly for the ''y'' and ''z'' directions. Hence the force equation is:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}= q(\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{\dot{r}}\times\mathbf{B})&lt;/math&gt;
|}

The potential energy depends on the velocity of the particle, so the force is velocity dependent, so it is not conservative.

The relativistic Lagrangian is

:&lt;math&gt;L = -mc^2\sqrt{1-\left(\frac{\dot{\mathbf{r}}}{c}\right)^2} + q \mathbf{A}(\mathbf{r})\cdot\dot{\mathbf{r}} - q \phi(\mathbf{r}) \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The action is the relativistic [[arclength]] of the path of the particle in [[space time]], minus the potential energy contribution, plus an extra contribution which [[Quantum Mechanics|quantum mechanically]] is an extra [[phase (waves)|phase]] a charged particle gets when it is moving along a vector potential.

The equations of motion derived by [[calculus of variations|extremizing]] the action (see [[matrix calculus]] for the notation):

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{P}}{\mathrm{d}t} =\frac{\partial L}{\partial \mathbf{r}} = q {\partial \mathbf{A} \over \partial \mathbf{r}}\cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}} - q {\partial \phi \over \partial \mathbf{r} }\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P} -q\mathbf{A} = \frac{m\dot{\mathbf{r}}}{\sqrt{1-\left(\frac{\dot{\mathbf{r}}}{c}\right)^2}}\,&lt;/math&gt;

are the same as [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamilton's equations of motion]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{p}}\left ( \sqrt{(\mathbf{P}-q\mathbf{A})^2 +(mc^2)^2} + q\phi \right ) \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{p}}{\mathrm{d}t} = -{\partial \over \partial \mathbf{r}}\left ( \sqrt{(\mathbf{P}-q\mathbf{A})^2 + (mc^2)^2} + q\phi \right ) \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

both are equivalent to the noncanonical form:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\left ( {m\dot{\mathbf{r}} \over \sqrt{1-\left(\frac{\dot{\mathbf{r}}}{c}\right)^2}} \right ) = q\left ( \mathbf{E} + \dot\mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{B} \right ) . \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

This formula is the Lorentz force, representing the rate at which the EM field adds relativistic momentum to the particle.

==Relativistic form of the Lorentz force==

===Covariant form of the Lorentz force===

====Field tensor====

{{main|Covariant formulation of classical electromagnetism|Mathematical descriptions of the electromagnetic field}}

Using the [[metric signature]] {{nowrap|(1, −1, −1, −1)}}, the Lorentz force for a charge ''q'' can be written in&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, J.D. Chapter 11&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lorentz covariance|covariant form]]:

{{Equation box 1
|indent =:
|equation = &lt;math&gt; \frac{\mathrm{d} p^\alpha}{\mathrm{d} \tau} = q  F^{\alpha \beta} U_\beta &lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding
|border
|border colour = #50C878
|background colour = #ECFCF4}}

where ''p&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;'' is the [[four-momentum]], defined as

:&lt;math&gt;p^\alpha = \left(p_0, p_1, p_2, p_3 \right) = \left(\gamma m c, p_x, p_y, p_z \right) \, ,&lt;/math&gt;

''τ'' the [[proper time]] of the particle, ''F&lt;sup&gt;αβ&lt;/sup&gt;'' the contravariant [[electromagnetic tensor]]

:&lt;math&gt;F^{\alpha \beta} = \begin{pmatrix}
0 &amp; -E_x/c &amp; -E_y/c &amp; -E_z/c \\
E_x/c &amp; 0 &amp; -B_z &amp; B_y \\
E_y/c &amp; B_z &amp; 0 &amp; -B_x \\
E_z/c &amp; -B_y &amp; B_x &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

and ''U'' is the covariant [[four-velocity|4-velocity]] of the particle, defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;U_\beta = \left(U_0, U_1, U_2, U_3 \right) = \gamma \left(c, -v_x, -v_y, -v_z \right) \, ,&lt;/math&gt;

in which

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma(v)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1- \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1- \frac{v_x^2 + v_y^2+ v_z^2}{c^2}}}&lt;/math&gt;

is the [[Lorentz factor]].

The fields are transformed to a frame moving with constant relative velocity by:

:&lt;math&gt; F'^{\mu \nu} = {\Lambda^{\mu}}_{\alpha} {\Lambda^{\nu}}_{\beta} F^{\alpha \beta} \, ,&lt;/math&gt;

where Λ''&lt;sup&gt;μ&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[Lorentz transformation]] tensor.

====Translation to vector notation====

The {{nowrap|1=''α'' = 1}} component (''x''-component) of the force is
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\mathrm{d} p^1}{\mathrm{d} \tau} = q U_\beta F^{1 \beta} = q\left(U_0 F^{10} + U_1 F^{11} + U_2 F^{12} + U_3 F^{13} \right) .&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the components of the covariant electromagnetic tensor ''F'' yields

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\mathrm{d} p^1}{\mathrm{d} \tau} = q \left[U_0 \left(\frac{E_x}{c} \right) + U_2 (-B_z) + U_3 (B_y) \right] .&lt;/math&gt;

Using the components of covariant [[four-velocity]] yields

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
 \frac{\mathrm{d} p^1}{\mathrm{d} \tau} &amp; = q \gamma \left[c \left(\frac{E_x}{c} \right) + (-v_y) (-B_z) + (-v_z) (B_y) \right] \\
 &amp;= q \gamma \left(E_x + v_y B_z - v_z B_y \right) \\
 &amp; = q \gamma \left[ E_x + \left( \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B} \right)_x \right] \, .
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

The calculation for {{nowrap|1=''α'' = 2}}, 3 (force components in the ''y'' and ''z'' directions) yields similar results, so collecting the 3 equations into one:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\mathrm{d} \mathbf{p} }{\mathrm{d} \tau} = q \gamma\left( \mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B} \right) \, , &lt;/math&gt;

and since differentials in coordinate time ''dt'' and proper time ''dτ'' are related by the Lorentz factor,

:&lt;math&gt;dt=\gamma(v)d\tau\,,&lt;/math&gt;

so we arrive at

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\mathrm{d} \mathbf{p} }{\mathrm{d} t} = q \left( \mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B} \right)\, .&lt;/math&gt;

This is precisely the Lorentz force law, however, it is important to note that '''p''' is the relativistic expression,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}=\gamma(v) m_0 \mathbf{v} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

===Lorentz force in spacetime algebra (STA)===

The electric and magnetic fields are [[Classical electromagnetism and special relativity|dependent on the velocity of an observer]], so the relativistic form of the Lorentz force law can best be exhibited starting from a coordinate-independent expression for the electromagnetic and magnetic fields  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;, and an arbitrary time-direction, &lt;math&gt;\gamma_0&lt;/math&gt;. This can be settled through [[Spacetime algebra|Space-Time Algebra]] (or the geometric algebra of space-time), a type of Clifford's Algebra defined on a [[pseudo-Euclidean space]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hestenes|first=David|authorlink=David Hestenes|title=SpaceTime Calculus|url=http://geocalc.clas.asu.edu/html/STC.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; as

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E} = (\mathcal{F}\cdot\gamma_0)\gamma_0&lt;/math&gt;

and

: &lt;math&gt;i\mathbf{B} = (\mathcal{F}\wedge\gamma_0)\gamma_0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathcal F&lt;/math&gt; is a space-time bivector (an oriented plane segment, just like a vector is an oriented line segment), which has six degrees of freedom corresponding to boosts (rotations in space-time planes) and rotations (rotations in space-space planes).  The dot product with the vector &lt;math&gt;\gamma_0&lt;/math&gt; pulls a vector (in the space algebra) from the translational part, while the wedge-product creates a trivector (in the space algebra) who is dual to a vector which is the usual magnetic field vector.
The relativistic velocity is given by the (time-like) changes in a time-position vector &lt;math&gt;v=\dot x&lt;/math&gt;, where

: &lt;math&gt;v^2 = 1,&lt;/math&gt;

(which shows our choice for the metric) and the velocity is

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = cv \wedge \gamma_0 / (v \cdot \gamma_0).&lt;/math&gt;

The proper (invariant is an inadequate term because no transformation has been defined) form of the Lorentz force law is simply

{{Equation box 1
|indent =:
|equation = &lt;math&gt; F = q\mathcal{F}\cdot v&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding
|border
|border colour = #50C878
|background colour = #ECFCF4}}

Note that the order is important because between a bivector and a vector the dot product is anti-symmetric. Upon a space time split like one can obtain the velocity, and fields as above yielding the usual expression.

===Lorentz force in general relativity===
In the [[general theory of relativity]] the equation of motion for a particle with mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and charge &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;, moving in a space with metric tensor &lt;math&gt;g_{ab}&lt;/math&gt; and electromagnetic field &lt;math&gt;F_{ab}&lt;/math&gt;, is given as
:&lt;math&gt;
m\frac{du_c}{ds}-m\frac{1}{2}g_{ab,c}u^au^b=eF_{cb}u^b \;,
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;u^a= dx^a/ds&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;dx^a&lt;/math&gt; is taken along the trajectory), &lt;math&gt;g_{ab,c}= \partial g_{ab}/\partial x^c&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;ds^2=g_{ab}dx^adx^b&lt;/math&gt;.

The equation can also be written as
:&lt;math&gt;
m\frac{du_c}{ds}-m\Gamma_{abc}u^au^b=eF_{cb}u^b \;,
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{abc}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Levi-Civita connection#Christoffel symbols|Christoffel symbol]] (of the torsion-free metric connection in general relativity), or as
:&lt;math&gt;
m\frac{Du_c}{ds}=eF_{cb}u^b \;,
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the [[covariant differential]] in general relativity (metric, torsion-free).

==Applications==

*[[Cyclotron]]s and other circular path [[particle accelerator]]s

*''Leo leo azandicus'' described in 1924 by [[Joel Asaph Allen]] was a male lion that was killed in 1912 in northeastern [[Belgian Congo]] as part of a zoological collection comprising 588 [[carnivore]] specimens.

In the following decades, there has been much debate among zoologists on the validity of proposed subspecies:
*In 1939, [[Glover Morrill Allen]] recognized ''Felis leo kamptzi'' and ''F. l. azandicus'' as [[Valid name (zoology)|valid]] [[Taxon|taxa]] among ten lion subspecies.&lt;ref name=Allen1939&gt;{{cite journal |author=Allen, G.

=== Genetic research ===
Since the beginning of the 21st century, several [[phylogenetic]] studies were conducted to aid clarifying the taxonomic status of lion samples kept in museums and collected in the wild. Scientists analysed between 32 and 480 lion samples from up to 22 countries. They all agree that the lion [[Species (biological)|species]] comprises two [[evolution]]ary groups, one in the northern and eastern parts of its historical range, and the other in [[Southern Africa|Southern]] and [[East Africa]] that [[Genetic divergence|diverged]] between 245,000 and 50,000 years ago.

In a comprehensive study about the evolution of lions, 357 samples of 11 lion populations were examined, including some [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] lions. The hybrids had descended from lions captured in [[Angola]] and [[Zimbabwe]], and apparently West or Central Africa. Results indicated that four lions from [[Morocco]] did not exhibit any unique genetic characteristics and shared mitochondrial [[haplotype]]s H5 and H6 with lions from West Africa, and together with them were part of a major [[mtDNA]] grouping (lineage III) that also included Asiatic samples. This scenario was well in line with theories on lion evolution: lineage III developed in East Africa and traveled north and west in the first wave of lion expansions about 118,000 years ago. It apparently broke up into haplotypes H5 and H6 within Africa, and then into H7 and H8 in [[West Asia]]&lt;ref name=Antunes2008/&gt;

Results of [[genetic analyses]] indicate that lions in West Africa and northern parts of Central Africa form distinct lion [[clade]]s, which are more closely related to North African and [[Asiatic lion]]s than to lions in Southern Africa and southern parts of East Africa. Lions from North Africa and India however, do form one single clade.&lt;ref name=Bertolaetal2011GD/&gt; Analysis of [[phylogenetic]] data of 194 lion samples from 22 different countries revealed that Central and West African lions form a phylogeographic group that probably diverged about 186,000–128,000 years ago from the ''melanochaita'' group in East and Southern Africa.&lt;ref name="Bertola_al2016"/&gt;

== Behaviour and ecology ==
{{multiple image |perrow=1 |footer=Lions in Gir Forest National Park |image1=Asiatic Lions Mating in Gir Forest.jpg |image2=Family_of_lioness.jpg}}
Male Asiatic lions are solitary or associate with up to three males forming a loose pride. Pairs of males rest, hunt and feed together, and display [[Marking territory|marking behaviour]] at the same sites. Females associate with up to 12 females forming a stronger pride together with their cubs. They share large carcasses among each other, but seldom with males. Female and male lions usually associate only for a few days when [[mating]], but rarely travel and feed together.&lt;ref name=Joslin1973&gt;{{cite book |author=Joslin, P. |year=1973 |title=The Asiatic lion: a study of ecology and behaviour |location=University of Edinburgh, UK |publisher=Department of Forestry and Natural Resources}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Meena2008&gt;{{cite book |author=Meena V. |year=2008 |title=Reproductive strategy and behaviour of male Asiatic Lions |location=Dehra Dun |publisher=Wildlife Institute of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Pendjari National Park, groups of lions range from 1–8 individuals. Outside the National Park, groups are smaller and with a single male.&lt;ref name="Sogbohossou_al2014"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Sogbohossou, E. A. |author2=Bauer, H. |author3=Loveridge, A. |author4=Funston, P. J. |author5=De Snoo, G. R. |author6=Sinsin, B. |author7=De Iongh, H.

In Waza National Park, three female and two male lions were [[Radio telemetry|radio-collared]] in 1999 and tracked until 2001. The females moved in home ranges of between {{convert|352|and|724|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and stayed inside the park during most of the survey period. The males used home ranges of between {{convert|428|and|1054|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, both inside and outside the park, where they repeatedly killed livestock. One was killed and the other shot at by local people. After the pellets were removed, he recovered and shifted his home range to inside the park, and was not observed killing livestock any more.&lt;ref name=Bauer_al2005&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Bauer, H. and De Iongh, H.

===Hunting and diet===
In general, lions prefer large prey species within a weight range of {{convert|190|to|550|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. They hunt large [[ungulate]]s in the range of {{convert|40.0|to|270.0|kg|lb|abbr=in}} including [[zebra]], [[warthog]], [[blue wildebeest]], [[impala]], [[gemsbok]], [[Thomson's gazelle]], [[kob]], [[giraffe]] and [[Cape Buffalo]].&lt;ref name="HaywardKerley2005"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Hayward, M. W. and Kerley, G. I. |year=2005 |title=Prey preferences of the lion (''Panthera leo'') |journal=Journal of Zoology |volume=267 |issue=3|pages=309–322 |doi=10.1017/S0952836905007508}}&lt;/ref&gt; In India's Gir Forest National Park, lions predominantly kill [[chital]], [[Sambar deer|sambar]], [[nilgai]], cattle, [[domestic buffalo|buffalo]] and less frequently also [[wild boar]]. Outside the protected area where wild prey species do not occur, lions prey on buffalo and cattle, rarely also on [[camel]]. They kill most prey less than {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}} away from water bodies, charge prey from close range and drag carcasses into dense cover.&lt;ref name=Chellam1993&gt;{{cite book |author=Chellam, R. and Johnsingh, A.

L. |publisher=Zoological Society of London |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lions probably prey on livestock when wild prey species occur at lower densities, especially during the wet season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Ten Years of Ecological Research on Lions in Waza National Park, Northern Cameroon |author=De Iongh, H., Bauer, H. |journal=Cat News 48 |year=2008 |pages=29−32}}&lt;/ref&gt; An interview survey among livestock owners in six villages in the park's vicinity revealed that lions attack [[cattle]] mostly during the [[wet season|rainy season]] when wild prey disperses away from artificial waterholes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Factors affecting livestock predation by lions in Cameroon |author=Van Bommel, L., Bij de Vaate, M.

== Threats ==
In Africa, lions are killed pre-emptively or in retaliation for preying on livestock. Populations are also threatened by depletion of prey base, loss and conversion of habitat.&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt;

The lion population in West Africa is fragmented and isolated, comprising fewer than 250 mature individuals.&lt;ref name=iucn_WAL/&gt; It is threatened by [[poaching]] and [[illegal wildlife trade|illegal trade]] of body parts. Lion body parts from Benin are smuggled to Niger, Nigeria, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Senegal and Guinea, and from Burkina Faso to Benin, Ivory Coast, Senegal and Guinea.&lt;ref name="Williams2017"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Williams, V.

In Nigeria, the isolated lion population in Gashaka Gumti National Park is hunted and poisoned by local people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nicholas, A. |year=2004 |title=An update on the status of important large Mammal species in Gashaka Gumti National Park, Nigeria |journal=Antelope Survey Update |issue=9 |pages=40−42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Central African lion is threatened by loss of habitat and prey base and [[trophy hunting]]. Between seven and 12 lion trophies were exported from Cameroon every year in the years from 1985 to 2010. &lt;ref name=Chardonnet2002/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tumenta_al2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Croes_2011/&gt;
In northern parts of Cameroon, the lion population is threatened due to increased migration of people from Nigeria following the [[Boko Haram insurgency|political insecurity]] in the region.&lt;ref name="Brugière_al2015"/&gt;
In Bénoué National Park, local people were observed at a lion kill cutting off chunks of meat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Schoe, M., De Iongh, H.H. and Croes, B.M. |year=2009 |title=Humans displacing lions and stealing their food in Bénoué National Park, North Cameroon |journal=African Journal of Ecology |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=445−447}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local people living in the vicinity of the protected area accounted in interviews that lions frequently attack livestock during the dry season. They use poison on carcasses to kill carnivores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authors=Croes, B.M., Buij, R., van Dalen, J. and de Iongh, H.H. | year=2008 |title=International seminar on the conservation of small and hidden species.

Nomadic herders use bow and arrows poisoned with cobra [[venom]] to kill lions in retaliation for attacks on livestock.&lt;ref name=Tumenta_al2010/&gt;

== Conservation ==
{{multiple image |perrow=1 |image1=Lionne du Cameroun.JPG |caption1=Captive lions in [[Mefou National Park]] |image2=Two set of lions.jpg |caption2=Two captive lion cubs in Nigeria}}

In India, the lion is protected, and included in [[CITES Appendix I]].&lt;ref name="Iucn2008AL"&gt;{{IUCN |assessor1=Breitenmoser, U. |assessor2=Mallon, D. P. |assessor3=Ahmad Khan, J. |assessor4=Driscoll, C. |year=2008 |id=15952 |title=''Panthera leo'' ssp. ''persica'' |version=2017-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; African lions are included in [[CITES Appendix II]].&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt; In 2004, it was proposed in 2004 to list all lion populations in CITES Appendix I to reduce exports of lion trophies and implement a stricter permission process, due to the negative impact of trophy hunting.&lt;ref name="Nowell2004"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nowell, K. |year=2004 |title=The Cat Specialist Group at CITES 2004 |journal=Cat News 41 |page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, a Lion Conservation Strategy for West and Central Africa was developed in cooperation between IUCN regional offices and several wildlife conservation organisations. The strategy envisages to maintain sufficient habitat, ensure a sufficient wild prey base, make lion-human coexistence sustainable and reduce factors that lead to further fragmentation of populations.&lt;ref name=csg2006/&gt;
Surveys and interviews with herders around protected areas revealed that improved enclosures for livestock significantly decreased depredation by lions, and hence contributed to mitigating human-lion conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Assessment and mitigation of human-lion conflict in West and Central Africa |author=Bauer, H., de Iongh, H. and Sogbohossou, E. |journal=Mammalia |year=2010 |volume=74 |pages=363–367 |doi=10.1515/MAMM.2010.048}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In captivity ===
In 2006, 1258 [[captive animal|captive]] lions were registered in the International Species Information System, including 13 individuals originating from Senegal to Cameroon, 115 from India and 970 with uncertain origin.&lt;ref name=Barnett2006/&gt;

A '''peace congress''', in [[international relations]], has at times been defined in a way that would distinguish it from a [[peace conference]] (usually defined as a diplomatic meeting to decide on a [[peace treaty]]), as an ambitious forum to carry out dispute resolution in international affairs, and prevent wars. This idea was widely promoted during the nineteenth century, anticipating the international bodies that would be set up in the twentieth century with comparable aims.

==History==

The genesis of the idea of a [[meeting]] of representatives of different [[nation]]s to obtain by peaceful arbitrament a settlement of differences has been traced to the year 1623 in modern history, to a French monk, [[Émeric Crucé]], who wrote a work entitled "The New Cyneas", a discourse showing the opportunities and the means for establishing a general [[peace]] and [[liberty of conscience]] to all the world and addressed to the monarch and the sovereign princes of the time. He proposed that a city, preferably [[Venice]], should be selected where all the powers had ambassadors and that there should be a [[world government|universal]] union, including all [[people]]s. He suggested careful arrangement as to priority, giving the first place to the pope.

Two years after this publication, in 1625, appeared in Latin the work of [[Hugo Grotius]] "On the Right of War and Peace", pleading for a mitigation of some of the barbarous usages of war.

[[William Penn]]  had a plan for the establishment of a "European Dyet, Parliament or Estates". He was followed by other writers of different nationalities.

The concept of a peaceful community of [[nation]]s had also been outlined in 1795, when [[Immanuel Kant]]’s ''Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/kant/kant1.htm |last=Kant |first=Immanuel |publisher=Mount Holyoke College| title=Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch|accessdate=2008-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; outlined the idea of a league of nations that would control conflict and promote peace between states.&lt;ref&gt;Skirbekk and Gilje 2001, p. 288&lt;/ref&gt;

International co-operation to promote [[collective security]] originated in the [[Concert of Europe]] that developed after the [[Napoleonic War]] in the nineteenth century in an attempt to maintain the status quo between European states and so avoid war.&lt;ref&gt;Reichard 2006, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rapoport 1995, pp. 498-500&lt;/ref&gt; This period also saw the development of international law with the first [[Geneva Conventions]] establishing laws about humanitarian relief during war and the international [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Conventions]] of 1899 and 1907 governing rules of war and the peaceful settlement of international disputes.&lt;ref&gt;Bouchet-Saulnier, Brav, and Olivier 2007, pp. 14-134&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Northedge 1986, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

The forerunner of the League of Nations, the [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]] (IPU), was formed by peace activists [[William Randal Cremer]] and [[Frédéric Passy]] in 1889.  The organization was international in scope with a third of the members of [[parliament]], in the 24 countries with parliaments, serving as members of the IPU by 1914.  Its aims were to encourage governments to solve international disputes by peaceful means and arbitration and annual conferences were held to help governments refine the process of international arbitration.    The IPU's structure consisted of a Council headed by a President which would later be reflected in the structure of the League.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title =Before the League of Nations | publisher = The United Nations Office at Geneva | url =http://www.unog.ch/80256EE60057D930/(httpPages)/B5B92952225993B0C1256F2D00393560?OpenDocument | accessdate =2008-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Congresses==

===Vienna===

After the defeat of [[Napoleon I of France]] an international peace congress took place in [[Vienna]] called the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815.

===The Americas in the nineteenth century===

In 1826, a congress composed of representatives of Spanish-American countries was planned by [[Simón Bolívar|Bolívar]] for military as well as political purposes. One of its declared objects was "to promote the peace and union of American nations and establish amicable methods for the settlement of disputes between them". This congress failed, as only four Spanish-American countries were represented and only one ratified the agreement.

In 1831, however, [[Mexico]] took up the subject and proposed a conference of [[United States|American]] Republics "for the purpose of bringing about not only a union and close alliance for defence, but also the acceptance of friendly mediation for the settlement of disputes between them, and the framing and promulgation of a code of penal laws to regulate their mutual relations". It does not appear that anything came of this congress, and in 1847 another was held at [[Lima]], attended by representatives of [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]], [[Ecuador]], [[Republic of New Granada|New Granada]], and [[Peru]], for the purpose of forming an alliance of American republics. The United States was invited but as it was then at war with Mexico it sent no representative.

Another congress was held by representatives from the Argentine Republic, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Peru, and Venezuela, in 1864.

An effort to hold a congress was made by the governments of Chile and Colombia in 1880, "to the end that the settlement by arbitration of each and every international controversy should become a principle of American public law". This congress did not meet, however, owing to a war between Chile and Peru.

In 1881, the [[President of the United States]] invited the independent countries of North and South America to meet in a general congress at [[Washington, D.C.]] on 24 November 1882, "for the purpose of considering and discussing methods of preventing war between the nations of America". This meeting did not take place owing to a variety of reasons, but subsequently, by virtue of an [[Act of Congress of the United States]] an invitation was issued by the president to Mexico, the Central and South American Republics, Haiti, Dominican Republic, and Brazil to join in a conference to be held in the city of Washington, the project being to consider:

* (1) measures tending to preserve the peace and promote the prosperity of the South American States;
* (2) measures looking to the formation of an American Customs Union;
* (3) the establishment of regular and frequent communication between the various countries;
* (4) the establishment of a uniform system of customs regulations, invoices, [[sanitation of ships]], and [[quarantine]];
* (5) the adoption of a uniform system of [[weights and measures]], and of laws to protect patent rights, copyrights, and trade marks, and for the extradition of criminals;
* (6) the adoption of a common silver coin;
* (7) the adoption of a definite plan of arbitration of all questions, disputes, and differences; and
* (8) such other subjects relating to the welfare of the several States as might be presented by any of them.

The [[First International Conference of American States]] assembled at Washington on 2 October 1889. Eighteen American nations, including the United States, had their representatives. The conference adopted a plan of arbitration of international differences, together with various recommendations relating to trade, law, extradition, patents, customs, and sanitary regulations. It further declared arbitration to be a principle of American International Law and obligatory "in all controversies concerning diplomatic and consular privileges, boundaries, territories, indemnities, the right of navigation, and the validity, construction and enforcement of treaties; and that it should be equally obligatory in all other cases, whatever might be their origin, nature or object, with the sole exception of those which in the judgment of one of the nations involved in the controversy, might imperil its independence; but that even in this case, while arbitration for that nation should be optional, it should be obligatory on the adversary power" (7 Moore Int. Law Dig. p.&amp;nbsp;7). One notable result of the conference was the establishment of the Bureau of the American Republics. All the republics of South America are represented in this bureau, which continues for periods of ten years subject to renewal.

===American Civil War===

The [[Peace Conference of 1861]] was a last-ditch effort to avert the coming Civil War.

===Friends of Peace===

{{main|International Peace Congress}}
Following an initial congress at London in 1843, an annual series of congresses called [[International Congress of the Friends of Peace]] or more informally "International Peace Congress" were organised from 1848 until 1853.

[[Elihu Burritt]] organized the Congress of 1848.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Burritt, Elihu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The participants met at [[Brussels, Belgium|Brussels]] in September of that year.  Among the distinguished delegates were [[Richard Cobden|Cobden]], [[Augustin Thierry|Thierry]], [[Emile de Girardin|Girardin]], and [[Frédéric Bastiat|Bastiat]].  The congress adopted resolutions urging limitation of armaments and the placing of a ban upon foreign loans for war purposes.  Through the next decade, more congresses were convened in various cities without the development of anything new in principle or method.

* 1st congress: [[London]] (1843)
* 2nd congress: [[Brussels]] (1848)
* 3rd congress: [[Paris]] (1849)
* 4th congress: [[Frankfurt am Main]] (1850)
* 5th congress: [[London]] (1851)
* 6th congress: [[Manchester]] (1852)
* 7th congress: [[Edinburgh]] (1853)

===The Hague===
{{main|Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907}}

====First Hague Conference====

On 12 August 1898, in a circular letter addressed to the representatives of different nations, the Emperor of Russia proposed to all governments, which had duly accredited representatives at the imperial court, the holding of a conference to consider the problem of the preservation of peace among nations. During the summer of 1900 the conference assembled at [[The Hague]] and on 4 September the formal notification of the ratification of the convention for the pacific settlement of international disputes was given by the [[United States]], [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Denmark]], [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Persia]], [[Portugal]], [[Romania]], [[Russia]], [[Siam]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], [[Norway]], and the [[Netherlands]], and subsequently by [[Japan]]. A [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]] was established at The Hague, composed representatives of each of the signatory powers appointed for a term of six years. Arbitrators called upon to form a competent tribunal may be chosen from a general list of the members of the court when any of the signatory powers desire to have recourse to the court for a settlement of any difference between them.

The South and Central American republics were not represented at the conference, but at the second [[International Conference of American States]] which was initiated by President McKinley and held in the City of [[Mexico]], 22 October 1901, to 31 January 1902, a plan was adopted looking to adhesion to The Hague convention, the protocol being signed by all of the delegations except [[Chile]] and [[Ecuador]], who subsequently gave their adhesion. The conference authorized the Governments of the United States and Mexico to negotiate with the other signatory powers for the adherence of other American nations. At this conference the project of a treaty for the arbitration of pecuniary claims was adopted, and the signatories agreed for a term of five years to submit to arbitration (preferably to the permanent court at The Hague) all claims for pecuniary loss or damage presented by their respective citizens and not capable of settlement through diplomatic channels, where they were of sufficient importance to warrant the expense of a court of arbitration.

====Second Hague Conference====

A second international peace conference was held at The Hague from 15 June to 18 October 1907. Forty-four States were represented, including the principal nations of Europe, North and South America, and Asia. The conference drew up thirteen conventions and one declaration. They are as follows: for the pacific settlement of international disputes; respecting the limitation of the employment of force for the recovery of contract debts relative to the opening of hostilities; respecting the laws and customs of war on land; respecting the rights and duties of neutral powers and persons in case of war on land; relative to the status of enemy merchant-ships at the outbreak of hostilities; relative to the conversion of merchant-ships into war-ships; relative to the laying of automatic submarine contact mines; respecting bombardment by naval forces in time of war; for the adaptation to naval war of the principles of the Geneva Convention; relative to certain restrictions with regard to the exercise of the right of capture in naval war; relative to the creation of an International Prize Court; concerning the rights and duties of neutral powers in naval war; and a declaration prohibiting the discharge of projectiles and explosives from balloons.

===International League of Peace and Liberty===

The [[League of Peace and Freedom|International League of Peace and Liberty]] organised a series of international peace congresses.

===World War I===

The [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]], that sought a lasting peace after [[World War I]], approved the proposal to create the League of Nations ([[French language|French]]: ''Société des Nations'', [[German language|German]]: ''Völkerbund'') on 25 January 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Magliveras 1999, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Covenant of the League of Nations]] was drafted by a special commission, and the League was established by Part I of the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. On 28 June 1919,&lt;ref&gt;Magliveras 1999, pp. 8–12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Northedge 1986, pp. 35–36&lt;/ref&gt; the Covenant was signed by 44 states, including 31 states which had taken part in the war on the side of the [[Triple Entente]] or joined it during the conflict. Despite American President [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s efforts to establish and promote the League, for which he was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1919,&lt;ref&gt;Levinovitz and Ringertz 2001, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United States]] did not join the League.

The League held its first council meeting in [[Paris]] on 16 January 1920, six days after the Versailles Treaty came into force.&lt;ref&gt;Scott 1973, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; In November, the headquarters of the League moved to [[Geneva]], where the first General Assembly was held on 15 November 1920&lt;ref&gt;Scott 1973, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; with representatives from 41 nations in attendance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11510">{{Algebraic structures}}
In [[mathematics]], '''racks''' and '''quandles''' are sets with [[binary operation]]s satisfying axioms analogous to the [[Reidemeister move]]s used to manipulate [[knot theory|knot]] diagrams.

While mainly used to obtain invariants of knots, they can be viewed as [[abstract algebra|algebraic]] constructions in their own right.  In particular, the definition of a quandle axiomatizes the properties of [[Inner automorphism|conjugation]] in a [[Group (mathematics)|group]].

==History==
In 1943, Mituhisa Takasaki (高崎光久) introduced an algebraic structure which he called a ''Kei'' (圭), which would later come to be known as an involutive quandle.&lt;ref name="takasaki"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Mituhisa |last=Takasaki| title=Abstractions of symmetric functions|year=1943|journal=[[Tohoku Mathematical Journal]]|volume=49|pages=143&amp;ndash;207}}&lt;/ref&gt; His motivation was to find a nonassociative algebraic structure to capture the notion of a [[reflection (mathematics)|reflection]] in the context of [[finite geometry]]. The idea was rediscovered and generalized in (unpublished) 1959 correspondence between [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]] and [[Gavin Wraith]],&lt;ref name="cw"&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=John H.|last1=Conway|first2=Gavin|last2=Wraith|title=(unpublished correspondence)|year=1959|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; who at the time were undergraduate students at the [[University of Cambridge]]. It is here that the modern definitions of quandles and of racks first appear. Wraith had become interested in these structures (which he initially dubbed '''sequentials''') while at school.&lt;ref name="wraith"&gt;{{cite web|first=Gavin|last=Wraith|title=A Personal Story about Knots|url=http://www.wra1th.plus.com/gcw/rants/math/Rack.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060313115547/http://www.wra1th.plus.com/gcw/rants/math/Rack.html|archivedate=2006-03-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Conway renamed them '''wracks''', partly as a pun on his colleague's name, and partly because they arise as the remnants (or 'wrack and ruin') of a [[group (mathematics)|group]] when one discards the multiplicative structure and considers only the [[inner automorphism|conjugation]] structure.  The spelling 'rack' has now become prevalent.

These constructs surfaced again in the 1980s:  in a 1982 paper by [[David E. Joyce (mathematician)|David Joyce]]&lt;ref name="joyce"&gt;{{cite journal|first=David|last=Joyce|title=''A classifying invariant of knots: the knot quandle''|journal=[[Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra]]|volume=23|year=1982|pages=37&amp;ndash;65|doi=10.1016/0022-4049(82)90077-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; (where the term '''quandle''' was coined),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Baez|first1=John|title=The Origin of the word 'Quandle'|url=https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2015/05/the_origin_of_the_word_quandle.html|website=The n-Category Cafe|accessdate=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a 1982 paper by [[:ru:Сергей Матвеев|Sergei Matveev]] (under the name '''distributive groupoids''')&lt;ref name="matveev"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Sergei|last=Matveev|title=''Distributive groupoids in knot theory''|journal=[[Math.

==Racks==
A '''rack''' may be defined as a set &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathrm{R}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; with a binary operation &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \triangleleft&lt;/math&gt; such that for every &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle a,\, b,\, c \;\in\; \mathrm{R}&lt;/math&gt; the '''self-distributive law''' holds:
:&lt;math&gt;a \triangleleft(b \triangleleft c) = (a  \triangleleft b) \triangleleft(a  \triangleleft c)&lt;/math&gt;

and for every &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle a,\, b \;\in\; \mathrm{R}&lt;/math&gt; there exists a unique &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle c \;\in\; \mathrm{R}&lt;/math&gt; such that 
:&lt;math&gt;a \triangleleft c = b&lt;/math&gt;

This definition, while terse and commonly used, is suboptimal for certain purposes because it contains an existential quantifier which is not really necessary. To avoid this, we may write the unique &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle c \;\in\; \mathrm{R}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle a \, \triangleleft\, c \;=\; b&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle b \,\triangleright\, a&lt;/math&gt;.  We then have
:&lt;math&gt; a \triangleleft c = b \iff c = b \triangleright a &lt;/math&gt;

and thus 
:&lt;math&gt; a \triangleleft(b \triangleright a) = b&lt;/math&gt;

and
:&lt;math&gt;(a \triangleleft b) \triangleright a = b&lt;/math&gt;

Using this idea, a rack may be equivalently defined as a set &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathrm{R}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; with two binary operations &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \triangleleft &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \triangleright &lt;/math&gt; such that for all  &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle a,\, b,\, c \;\in\; \mathrm{R}&lt;/math&gt;:
#&lt;math&gt;a \triangleleft(b \triangleleft c) =  (a \triangleleft b) \triangleleft(a \triangleleft c)&lt;/math&gt; (left self-distributive law) 
#&lt;math&gt;(c \triangleright b) \triangleright a = (c \triangleright a) \triangleright(b \triangleright a)&lt;/math&gt; (right self-distributive law) 
#&lt;math&gt;(a \triangleleft b) \triangleright a = b&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;a \triangleleft(b \triangleright a) = b&lt;/math&gt;

It is convenient to say that the element &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle a \;\in\; \mathrm{R}&lt;/math&gt; is acting from the left in the expression &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle a \, \triangleleft\, b&lt;/math&gt;, and acting from the right in the expression &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle b \, \triangleright\, a&lt;/math&gt;.  The third and fourth rack axioms then say that these left and right actions are inverses of each other.  Using this, we can eliminate either one of these actions from the definition of rack.  If we eliminate the right action and keep the left one, we obtain the terse definition given initially.

Many different conventions are used in the literature on racks and quandles.  For example, many authors prefer to work with just the ''right'' action.  Furthermore, the use of the symbols &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \triangleleft &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \triangleright &lt;/math&gt; is by no means universal: many authors use exponential notation
:&lt;math&gt;a \triangleleft b = {}^a b&lt;/math&gt;

and
:&lt;math&gt;b \triangleright a = b^{a}&lt;/math&gt;

while many others write
:&lt;math&gt;b \triangleright a = b \star a &lt;/math&gt;

Yet another equivalent definition of a rack is that it is a set where each element acts on the left and right as [[automorphism]]s of the rack, with the left action being the inverse of the right one.  In this definition, the fact that each element acts as automorphisms encodes the left and right self-distributivity laws, and also these laws:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  a \triangleleft(b \triangleright c) &amp;= (a \triangleleft b) \triangleright(a\ \triangleleft c) \\
  (c \triangleleft b) \triangleright a &amp;= (c \triangleright a) \triangleleft(b \triangleright a)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

which are consequences of the definition(s) given earlier.

==Quandles==
A '''quandle''' is defined as a rack, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathrm{Q}\,&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \forall a \;\in\; \mathrm{Q}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;a \triangleleft a = a&lt;/math&gt;

or equivalently
: &lt;math&gt;a \triangleright a = a&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples and applications==
Every group gives a quandle where the operations come from conjugation:
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  a \triangleleft b &amp;= a b a^{-1} \\
   b \triangleright a &amp;= a^{-1} b a \\
                     &amp;= a^{-1} \triangleleft b
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

In fact, every equational law satisfied by [[inner automorphism|conjugation]] in a group follows from the quandle axioms.  So, one can think of a quandle as what is left of a group when we forget multiplication, the identity, and inverses, and only remember the operation of conjugation.

Every [[tame knot]] in [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] [[Euclidean space]] has a 'fundamental quandle'.  To define this, one can note that the [[fundamental group]] of the knot complement, or [[knot group]], has a presentation (the [[Wirtinger presentation]]) in which the relations only involve conjugation.  So, this presentation can also be used as a presentation of a quandle.  The fundamental quandle is a very powerful invariant of knots.  In particular, if two knots have [[isomorphic]] fundamental quandles then there is a [[homeomorphism]] of three-dimensional Euclidean space, which may be [[orientation reversing]], taking one knot to the other.

Less powerful but more easily computable invariants of knots may be obtained by counting the homomorphisms from the knot quandle to a fixed quandle &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathrm{Q}\,&lt;/math&gt;.  Since the Wirtinger presentation has one generator for each strand in a [[knot diagram]], these invariants can be computed by counting ways of labelling each strand by an element of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathrm{Q}\,&lt;/math&gt;, subject to certain constraints.  More sophisticated invariants of this sort can be constructed with the help of quandle [[cohomology]].

The Alexander quandles are also important, since they can be used to compute the [[Alexander polynomial]] of a knot.  Let &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathrm{A}&lt;/math&gt; be a module over the ring  &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathbb{Z}\left[t,\, t^{-1}\right]&lt;/math&gt; of [[Laurent polynomial]]s in one variable. Then the '''Alexander quandle''' is &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathrm{A}&lt;/math&gt; made into a quandle with the left action given by
:&lt;math&gt;a \triangleleft b = tb + (1 - t)a &lt;/math&gt;

Racks are a useful generalization of quandles in topology, since while quandles can represent knots on a round linear object (such as rope or a thread), racks can represent ribbons, which may be twisted as well as knotted.

A quandle &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathrm{Q}&lt;/math&gt; is said to be '''involutory''' if for all &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle a,\, b \;\in\; \mathrm{Q}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; a \triangleleft(a \triangleleft b) = b &lt;/math&gt;

or equivalently
: &lt;math&gt; (b \triangleright a) \triangleright a = b &lt;/math&gt;

Any [[Riemannian symmetric space|symmetric space]] gives an involutory quandle, where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle a \, \triangleleft\, b&lt;/math&gt; is the result of 'reflecting &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle b&lt;/math&gt; through &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle a&lt;/math&gt;'.

'''Reflexive self-consciousness''' is a concept, related to that of [[enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]], formulated by [[Eugene Halliday]] during the 1940s-1950s in England. He set out his concept in his book, ''Reflexive Self-Consciousness'', which, having been circulated in softback format for many years, was published in hardback in 1989 by Melchisedec Press, {{ISBN|1-872240-01-1}}.

In his book, Eugene Halliday sets out a way by which we can develop the ability to respond adequately to the demands life makes of us, the ability to assimilate the shocks and blows of experience, so we can live a whole and balanced life. The way to this balance is through an understanding of the centre of our own being, our consciousness, and through this, finding our place in relation to the universe.

==Meaning of reflexive self-consciousness==
Eugene Halliday made a lifelong study of [[art]], [[religion]], [[philosophy]], [[psychology]] and [[science]]. From his understanding, he formulated a coherent set of ideas. In his seminal work "Reflexive Self-Consciousness", he sets out the nature of [[consciousness]] and its relation to the world of phenomena, being, and mankind. From this, he explains how consciousness itself can become "reflexive". By this he means that consciousness becomes completely self-transparent and continuously aware of its own presence and nature.

He says that when observing a thing or situation one can promote this reflexive state by turning our own consciousness back onto itself. "It is the self, which is consciousness itself which is observing this thing, this self I am, I return to the self." By placing our nature as observer at the heart of his work, Halliday sets out a method by which to liberate ourselves from object-identification, which locks us into a cycle of conditioned reflexes, pleasure pursuit and pain avoidance.

He sees a complex structure of cells, such as the brain, as "a vehicle for the expression of the complex processes of consciousness" and not as the origin of that consciousness. No matter how complex the arrangement, consciousness cannot arise from the biochemical interactions of a large number of non-sentient particles.

==Origin of being==
Halliday posits that the ultimate source and origin of our being is sentience or consciousness. He sees this origin as an infinite field of sentient power. Halliday compares the activity of this infinite field of sentient power, the source of all beings, to that of the sea. Its internal movements, its waves, create vortices within it, which give rise to all the observable phenomena of the world. [[Atom]]s, [[molecule]]s, [[cell (biology)|cells]], [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, mankind, human beings, all are formed within this infinite sentient field, and all are sentient. There is no non-sentient level of being. Thus agreeing with the philosopher [[Alfred North Whitehead]] when he said "there are no dead gaps in Nature". This infinite field of sentient power, which is the ultimate source of the universe and all within it, is the Godhead of the theologians, the Absolute of the philosophers.

==Involution==
Before evolution, Eugene Halliday posits an "involution", whereby the motions of this absolute sentient power creates the universe and all the beings in it. Consciousness tends to fall into identification with beings, down to the grossest physical level of the mineral world. Through the process of evolution, sentience evolves through mineral, plant, animal and human to rediscover its true nature as Consciousness itself, at one with the infinite field of consciousness. This return of consciousness to its source, is the ''Reflexive Self-Consciousness'' of the title of the book.

{{History of the Jews in England}}

The '''resettlement of the Jews in England''' was an informal arrangement during the Commonwealth of England in the mid-1650s, which allowed Jews to practise their faith openly. It forms a prominent part of the [[history of the Jews in England]]. It happened directly after two events. Firstly a prominent rabbi [[Menasseh ben Israel]] came to the country from the Netherlands to make the case for Jewish resettlement, and secondly a Spanish [[New Christian]] (a supposedly converted Jew, who secretly practised his religion) merchant Antonio Robles requested that he be classified as a Jew rather than Spaniard during the war between England and Spain.

Historians have disagreed about the reasons behind the resettlement, particularly regarding [[Oliver Cromwell]]’s motives, but the move is generally seen as a part of a current of religious and intellectual thought moving towards liberty of conscience, encompassing [[philosemitic]] [[millenarianism]] and [[Hebraic]]ism, as well as political and trade interests favouring Jewish presence in England. The schools of thought that led to the resettlement of the Jews in England is the most heavily studied subject of Anglo-Jewish history in the period before the Eighteenth Century.&lt;ref&gt;Gow, Andrew Colin and Fradkin, Jeremy (2016).

OUP {{ISBN|9780199646920}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In 1290, King [[Edward I of England]] had issued an [[Edict of Expulsion|edict expelling all Jews from England]].&lt;ref name=bbc2011&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/judaism/history/350.shtml|title=Readmission of Jews to Britain in 1656|author=Tara Holmes|date=24 June 2011|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the [[English Reformation]], which started in the 1530s, brought a number of changes that benefited Jews in the long term.  Doctrines and rituals of the Roman Catholic church that hurt Jews were eliminated, especially those that emphasised their role in the death of Jesus. Further [[Anti-Catholicism in the United Kingdom|anti-Catholicism]], with the Pope as [[antichrist]], came to replace anti-Semitism.&lt;ref&gt;Lindemann, Albert S.; Levy, Richard S. (2008).

University of Michigan Press. {{ISBN|9780472086092}}. p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; The period of the [[English Civil War]]s and [[Interregnum (England)|Interregnum]], were marked by both widespread [[Millennialism|millennial]] beliefs and a beginning of religious toleration. Significantly, millenarianism in England often had a strong [[Hebraist]] character, that emphasised the study of Hebrew and Judaism. This often extended to seeing the English as the [[British Israelism|new Israelites]],&lt;ref&gt;Scult, Mel (1978).

{{main|History of the Marranos in England}}
After both the [[Alhambra Decree]] of 1492, which expelled Jews from Spain in 1492, and [[Persecution of Jews and Muslims by Manuel I of Portugal|similar measures in Portugal]] in 1496, some [[converso]] traders (Jewish converts to Christianity, who often practised Judaism in secret, sometimes also known as [[New Christians]] or derogatively as [[Marrano]]s) settled in London and Bristol.{{refn|In addition to these small communities of ‘[[port Jew]]s’, Henry VIII consulted rabbis on the biblical legitimacy of his divorce from Catherine of Aragon, and during the reign of Edward VI the Regius professor of Hebrew at Cambridge was the converso Hebraist [[Immanuel Tremellius]]. Elizabeth had a Jewish physician, [[Roderigo Lopez|Roderigo Lopes]], and her spymaster [[Francis Walsingham]]’s network of intelligencers included the Portuguese Marrano traders, Hector Nuñes and Dunstan Añez, as well as Lopes. Further, [[Sir Walter Raleigh]] travelled to the New World with Jewish mining expert [[Joachim Gans]] in 1584. It is estimated that there were roughly 80 to 90 Portuguese converses in Elizabethan London.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, John P (2012). [https://books.google.com/books?id=o6TaBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA71 ''The Life and Economics of David Ricardo''] Springer Science &amp; Business Media. {{ISBN| 9781461561293}} pps.71-73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ourmigrationstory.org.uk/oms/african-freedom-in-tudor-england-dr-hector-nuness-request ''African freedom in Tudor England: Dr Hector Nunes’ petition''] ourmigrationstory.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}} The small community was largely linked by trade to Antwerp, and was expelled altogether in 1609. It was with London’s growing importance as a trading city that Jews from the Netherlands began to settle in the country once more from the 1630s. It is from this first that the current Jewish population of the UK has grown.&lt;ref&gt;Edelman, Todd M. (2002).

===Religious toleration and liberty of conscience===
The 1640s and 1650s in England were marked by intense debates about religious toleration, marked by speeches and tracts by radical puritans and dissenters who called for liberty of conscience. This extreme diversity of opinion about religious toleration was sorted into 12 schools of thought in the seminal study of the period by [[Wilbur Kitchener Jordan|W.K. Jordan]].{{refn|These categories were: orthodox Presbyterians, moderate Presbyterians, Independents, Baptists, Latitudinarians, Cambridge Platonists, rationalists and sceptics, Erastians, the rank and file, Anglican extremists, moderate Anglicans, and Roman Catholics.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, Wilbur Kitchener (1938 and 1940). ''The Development of Religious Toleration in England. Vols. III and IV''. in Coffey (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note|text.}} John Coffey uses a simpler three point schema:  anti-tolerationists, conservative tolerationists, and radical tolerationists, pointing out that although the latter were in a minority, they formed an important part of the debate.&lt;ref name=Coffey2006&gt;Coffey, John (2006). [https://www.academia.edu/30764101/_The_toleration_controversy_during_the_English_Revolution_in_C._Durston_and_J._Maltby_eds_Religion_in_Revolutionary_England_Manchester_University_Press_2006_ The Toleration Controversy during the English Revolution]. in C. Durston and J. Maltby, eds, Religion in Revolutionary England. Manchester University Press, 2006. pps.42-68.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless it is important to remember that although figures such as [[William Walwyn]], [[Sir Henry Vane the Younger|Henry Vane]], [[John Milton]], and others made powerful apologia for religious toleration, their frame of reference was theological, rather than secular in nature and they were not calling for religious pluralism as is understood today.&lt;ref&gt;Walsham, Alexandra (2006).[https://books.google.com/books?id=MwNlIIGnckYC&amp;pg=PA233 Charitable Hatred: Tolerance and Intolerance in England, 1500-1700].

Princeton University Press. pps.195-196. {{ISBN|9781400850716}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The early and mid Seventeenth century was also marked by a rise in Hebraism, the study of Jewish scriptures, which were often used to discuss political issues such as the existence of a monarchy or republic, and religious toleration. This debate used Jewish sources to justify its conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, Kim Ian (2015). [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TraYCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT654 ‘A King Like Other Nations’: Political Theory and The Hebrew Republic in the Early Modern Age] in Kileen, Kevin, Smith, Helen, Willie, Rachel Judith (2015). The Oxford Handbook of the Bible in Early Modern England, c. 1530-1700. OUP Oxford. {{ISBN|9780191510595}}. &lt;/ref&gt; The most prominent scholar in the field was the MP and jurist, [[John Selden]], whose thought was influenced by [[Erastus]] and [[Grotius]]. Selden proposed minimal government intervention on matters of religion, a view he modelled on the [[Hebrew republic|Hebrew Commonwealth]]. He in turn influenced similar approaches in [[John Milton]] (whose plea for freedom of the press, the [[Areopagitica]] (1644), directly named him), [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]] (the latter of whom, proposed settling Jews in Ireland in his book ''[[The Commonwealth of Oceana]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Gertrude Himmelfarb|Himmelfarb, Gertrude]] (2011).

Encounter Books. {{ISBN|9781594035715}}. pps.144-146&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric M. Nelson|Nelson, Eric]] (2011). [https://www.fpri.org/docs/media/201105.nelson.religiousoriginsofreligioustolerance.pdf ''The Religious Origins of Religious Tolerance'']. [[Foreign Policy Research Institute]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall the strongest political group of the 1640s and 50s, the English Puritans, had a negative view of toleration, seeing it as a concession to evil and heresy. It was often associated with tolerating the heresies of [[Arminianism]], the philosophy of free will and free thought, and [[Socinianism]], a doctrine of [[Anti-trinitarianism]]. But despite this Puritan hostility to toleration, England did see a certain religious laissez-faire emerge (for instance, the [[Rump Parliament]] repealed the [[recusancy]] laws in 1650). This was partly due to the impossibility of stopping religious free expression, but it also became a part of the cause of the [[New Model Army|new model army]].&lt;ref&gt;Worden, Blair (2012). [https://books.google.com/books?id=evIKK1WdYdcC&amp;pg=PA68 ''God's Instruments: Political Conduct in the England of Oliver Cromwell'']. OUP. p.68. {{ISBN|9780199570492}}&lt;/ref&gt; The doctrinal policies of the protectorate were largely conservative, however this Puritan train of thought could also point towards liberty of conscience. For [[Congregationalists]], truth lay in the spirit rather than institutions; like the [[Cambridge Platonists|Platonists]] they searched for internal unity amidst external diversity.&lt;ref&gt;Worden (2012). pps. 69-70.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, Puritans valued conscience, which could be neither forced nor tested, over ritual and ceremony. So rather than toleration, the key debate among key figures in the Protectorate revolved around [[liberty of conscience]]. For [[Blair Worden]], Cromwell’s religious policy was rooted in a search for union of believers, rather than toleration of differing beliefs, and religious persecution was the largest obstacle to this union. However, liberty of conscience extended only to "God’s peculiar" and not heretics (such as [[Quakers]], Socinians, and [[Ranters]]).&lt;ref&gt;Worden (2012). pps. 71-73.&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a great increase of religious freedom and the ecclesiastical diversity in Cromwellian England, this marked a revolutionary change and led to increasing toleration in the years after the interregnum ended.&lt;ref&gt;Worden (2012). pps. 73-74.&lt;/ref&gt; On the one hand, while the loosely Calvinist Cromwell allowed the punishment of men such as the [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] [[John Biddle (Unitarian)|John Biddle]] and the [[Quaker]] [[James Nayler]], and accepted the restrictions on religious tolerance found in the [[Humble Petition and Advice]] of 1657. But on the other hand, his entourage included men who wanted more liberty of belief than he allowed. These non-sectarian ‘merciful men’ or [[politiques]], who wanted to understand and tolerate beliefs different to their own, included [[Bulstrode Whitelocke]], [[Matthew Hale (jurist)|Matthew Hale]], [[Charles Worsley|Sir Charles Worsley]].&lt;ref&gt;Worden, Blair (2012). [https://books.google.com/books?id=evIKK1WdYdcC&amp;pg=PA85 ''God's Instruments: Political Conduct in the England of Oliver Cromwell'']. OUP. p.85-86. {{ISBN|9780199570492}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Millenarian 'admissionists'===
The toleration of Jews was largely borne by the hope of [[Conversion of the Jews|converting them to Christianity]]. [[Leonard Busher]] was one of the first to call for the readmission of the Jews to England and the toleration of their faith in 1616. Lawyer and MP, [[Henry Finch]] and the scholar [[Joseph Mede]] both wrote of the benefits of the conversion of the Jews in the 1620s. The Scottish minister [[John Wemyss]] advocated readmitting Jews to Christian lands with a view to converting them in the 1630s. So, by the 1640s the imminent conversion of the Jews was a widespread belief among Puritans. Indeed during that decade the Christians who were most liberal towards Jews are also those who were most committed to their conversion. A number of these ‘admissionists’ were close to Cromwell, including [[John Sadler (Town Clerk of London)|John Sadler]], [[John Dury]], and [[Hugh Peter]]. Other notable readmissionists include exiled Royalist cleric [[Thomas Barlow (bishop)|Thomas Barlow]] and the Dissenter [[Henry Jessey]]. The [[Fifth Monarchy Men]] were another example of Puritan millenarians who saw the readmission of the Jews as hastening the kingdom of Christ. The exiled Royalist [[Edward Nicholas|Sir Edward Nicholas]] is one of the few admissionists who did not seem interested in conversion. By contrast, the anti-admissionists were often animated by the belief that it would be difficult or impossible to convert the Jews. [[William Prynne]]’s anti-Semitic pamphlet ''A Short Demurrer'', which was printed on the eve of the Whitehall Conference, and the pamphlet ''Anglo-Judaeus or The History of the Jews Whilst Here in England'' by W.H. both doubt that the Jews would be converted once in England.&lt;ref&gt;Scult, Mel (1978). [https://books.google.com/books?id=1tQUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA18 Millennial Expectations and Jewish Liberties: A Study of the Efforts to Convert the Jews in Britain, Up to the Mid Nineteenth Century]. Brill Archive. P.18-32&lt;/ref&gt; Many millenarians at the time emphasised the chosen role of England in God’s plan, and this was often accompanied by the identification the Jews as the true Israel of the Bible. Indeed, they saw the Jews as a superior group, sharing some characteristics with the chosen nation of England. This belief was rooted in the literal interpretation of the Biblical primacy of the Jews found in the writings of [[Thomas Brightman]].&lt;ref&gt;Hirschman and Yates (2014). p.167&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that if the Jews were specially favoured by God, the English must listen to their appeals for help.&lt;ref&gt;Crome, Andrew (2014). [https://books.google.com/books?id=qcokBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA189 ''The Restoration of the Jews: Early Modern Hermeneutics, Eschatology, and National Identity in the Works of Thomas Brightman''].

The original petition for readmission was submitted by Johanna and Ebenezer Cartwright, two English baptists living in Amsterdam, to [[Thomas Fairfax]]’s Council of War in January 1649. As well as asking that Jews be allowed to live in England, their petition also expressed the wish that the Jews "shall come to know the Emanuell" and that they be transported to the "Land promised to their fore-fathers". It can be seen as a distillation of the Judeo-centric trends of Puritan thought that had developed over the previous century since [[John Bale]] (1495 – 1563). However, the petition was sent the day before the [[High Court of Justice for the trial of King Charles I|high court was established to try Charles I]], so in the ensuing turmoil the Cartwrights never received an answer.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Robert O. (2013). [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SjJpAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA74 ''More Desired than Our Owne Salvation: The Roots of Christian Zionism'']. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|9780199993253}}. pps. 95-117&lt;/ref&gt;  The following year Amsterdam-based Rabbi and diplomat [[Menasseh Ben Israel]] wrote in his book ''Hope of Israel'' of the necessity of the Jews being "spread out to the ends of the earth" (Daniel 12:7) before they could be redeemed. The book was originally published in Dutch and Latin in 1650, and then in English (dedicated to Parliament and the Council of State) in 1652.&lt;ref&gt;Scult, Mel (1978).

Brill Archive. P.24&lt;/ref&gt; In 1651 Ben Israel met [[Oliver St John]] and his envoys on their mission to secure an Anglo-Dutch coalition. The English were impressed by learning and manner, and advised him to formally apply for Jewish readmission to England.&lt;ref name=sachar1994&gt;Sachar, Howard M. (1994).

In 1653, at Oliver St John’s suggestion, Cromwell issued an official directive to authorise, "Menasseh ben Israel, a rabbi of the Jewish nation, well respected for his learning and good affection to the State, to come from Amsterdam to these parts." Fearing local anti-English opinion so soon after war, ben Israel turned down the invitation. But by the middle of the decade, Cromwell was taking advice from [[Marrano]] trader [[Simon de Caceres]]. At de Caceres suggestion, Cromwell dispatched Marrano physician Abraham de Mercado and his son Raphael to [[History of the Jews in Barbados|Barbados]] (which a few years previously had already started admitting Jews escaping from the Portuguese reconquest of [[Dutch Brazil]]), where he explored the possibility of Jews setting in [[History of the Jews in Jamaica|Jamaica]]. There they would be offered full civil rights and even land grants.&lt;ref name=sachar1994 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stiefel, Barry L. (2014).

Univ of South Carolina Press. {{ISBN|9781611173215}}. p.128&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some difference of opinion as to Oliver Cromwell’s opinions regarding the readmission of the Jews. It has been pointed out that he held many of the same hopes regarding the readmission and conversion of the Jews as the millenarians. [[Paul Rycaut]], later ambassador to the port of [[Smyrna]] recalled the Whitehall Conference, "When they all met, he (Cromwell) ordered the Jews to speak for themselves. After that he turned to the clergy, who inveigled much against the Jews as a cruel and cursed people. Cromwell in his answer to the Clergy called them ‘Men of God’ and desired to be informed by the whether it was not their opinion that the Jews were one day to be called into the Church? He then desired to know whether it was not every Christian man’s duty to forward that good end all he could?… was it not then our duty… to encourage them to settle ere where they could be taught the thuth…[sic]"&lt;ref&gt;Scult, Mel (1978). P.30&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been pointed out that Cromwell held more practical beliefs. Cromwell believed that Jews could be used as skilled purveyors of foreign intelligence (which would assist his imperial ambitions).&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, Antonia. (1973).

He justified the readmission of the Jews using this same tolerant approach, as well as believing that it would improve trade (he saw the Jews as an important part of Amsterdam’s financial success).&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, David (2003).

Competition with the Dutch for trade and the increasingly protectionist commercial policy that led to the [[Navigation Acts#The 1651 Act|Navigation Act]] in October 1651 made [[Oliver Cromwell]] want to attract the rich Jews of Amsterdam to London so that they might transfer their important trade interests with the [[Spanish Main]] from the Netherlands to England. The mission of [[Oliver St John]] to Amsterdam, though failing to establish a coalition between English and Dutch commercial interests as an alternative to the Navigation Act, had negotiated with [[Menasseh Ben Israel]] and the Amsterdam community. A pass was granted to Menasseh to enter England, but he was unable to use it because of the [[First Anglo-Dutch War]], which lasted from 1652 to 1654.

==1655 and 1656: Informal resettlement achieved==

The years 1655 and 1656 were to prove decisive in the history of the resettlement of the Jews in England. The first of these was the visit of Menasseh ben Israel and the second was the case of the Murrano trader Antonio Rodrigues Robles.

===Menasseh Ben Israel's petition===
Menasseh ben Israel’s son Samuel had arrived in England accompanied by trader David Dormido&lt;ref name=AngloJewishDict&gt;eds. Rubinstein, William D.; Jolles, Michael and Rubinstein, Hilary L.

Palgrave Macmillan. p.227&lt;/ref&gt; in 1653 to investigate the possibility of the resettlement of the Jews. In May 1655, he was sent back to Amsterdam in order to try to convince his father to visit England. The rabbi came to England in September 1655 with three other local rabbis, where they were lodged as guests of Cromwell.&lt;ref name=sachar1994 /&gt; There he printed his "humble address" to Cromwell.{{refn|ben Israel’s petition was titled ’To His Highness the Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland, the Humble Addresses of Menasseh ben Israel, a Divine, and Doctor of Physick, in behalf of the Jewish Nation’.

The lawyers declared no opposition to the Jews' residing in England, but both the clergymen and merchants were opposed to readmission, leading Cromwell to stop the discussion to prevent an adverse decision.&lt;ref&gt;Sigal, Philip (1986).

===The Robles case===

Early in the following year (1656), the question came to a practical issue through the declaration of [[Anglo-Spanish War (1654–1660)|war against Spain]], which resulted in the arrest of [[Antonio Rodrigues Robles]], one of the community of Iberian New Christians who traded between London and the Canary Islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=71429|title=Robles, Antonio Rodrigues|first=Edgar|last=Samuel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robles petitioned for the return of his seized property on account of his being ‘of the Hebrew nation’ rather than Spanish. At the same time six leading members of the New Christian community petitioned Cromwell for permission to gather to worship and acquire a burial ground. Although no formal permission was granted, some assurances must have been given because in the summer Menasseh asked for the Torah scroll to be sent over from Amsterdam, and in the autumn Moses Athias moved from Hamburg to act as religious preceptor. By December 1656 they had rented a house for use as a synagogue, and services began in January of 1657.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishgen.org/jcr-uk/London/city_creechurch/index.htm Jewish Community and Records - Creechurch Lane Synagogue] http://www.jewishgen.org/&lt;/ref&gt; In February of 1657 the new community, represented by [[Antonio Fernandez Carvajal]] and [[Simon de Caceres]], acquired land near [[Mile End]] for use as a Synagogue. Historian Todd Endelman makes the point that it is unlikely this activity could have happened without Cromwell’s permission that they could live as professing Jews. The informal nature of the resettlement also meant the forces ranged against it had no target and never united to form any significant opposition. Further, at a later date it meant there were no restrictive laws to repeal when Jews wanted fuller citizenship rights. By the end of the decade the number of Jewish families had risen to thirty five.&lt;ref&gt;Edelman, Todd M. (2002). [https://books.google.com/books?id=RNyvgPAuvhAC&amp;pg=PA26 The Jews of Britain, 1656 to 2000]. University of California Press. {{ISBN|9780520935662}} pps.26-27, 29&lt;/ref&gt; In 1657 [[Solomon Dormido]], a nephew of Menasseh Ben Israel, was admitted to the [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]] as a duly licensed broker of the City of London, without taking the usual oath involving a statement of faith in [[Christianity]], (when he was finally sworn in&lt;!--not a mistake--&gt; in 1668, the oath was changed for him).&lt;ref name=AngloJewishDict /&gt; Carvajal had previously been granted letters of [[denization]] for himself and his son, which guaranteed certain rights of citizenship.

==Debating the return of the Jews==
During the years 1655-56 the question of the return of Jews to England was fought in a [[pamphlet war]]. Conservative opponents including [[William Prynne]] opposed the return while the Quaker [[Margaret Fell]] was in favour. Christian supporters believed the conversion of Jews was a sign of the [[end times]] and the readmission to England was a step towards that goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Debate over the Resettlement of Jews in England, 1655–56|url=https://www.wwnorton.com/college/english/nael/17century/topic_4/debate.htm|work=The Norton Anthology of English Literature}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This method of debate had the advantage of not raising [[anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic]] feelings too strongly; and it likewise enabled [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], on his [[Restoration (1660)|Restoration]] in 1660, to avoid taking any action on the petition of the merchants of London asking him to revoke Cromwell's concession. He had been assisted during his exile by several Jews of royalist sympathies, such as Andrea Mendes da Costa ([[Chamberlain (office)|Chamberlain]] of [[Catherine of Braganza]], wife of Charles II), Antonio Mendes (the physician brother of Andrea, who had cured Catherine of [[erysipelas]] while in Portugal) and Augustine Coronel-Chacon. In 1664 a further attempt was made by the [[Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Berkshire|Earl of Berkshire]] and [[Paul Ricaut]] to bring about the expulsion of the Jews, but the [[King-in-Council]] assured the latter of the continuance of former favour. Similar appeals to prejudice were made in 1673, when Jews, for meeting in Duke's Place for a religious service, were indicted on a charge of rioting, and in 1685, when thirty-seven were arrested on the Royal Exchange; but the proceedings in both cases were put a stop to by direction of the [[Privy Council]]. The status of the Jews was still very indeterminate. In 1684, it was contended by the [[British East India Company|East India Company]] that they were alien [[infidel]]s, and perpetual enemies to the English crown. Even the [[Attorney-General]] declared that they resided in England only under an implied licence. As a matter of fact, the majority of them were still aliens and liable to all the [[Disabilities (Jewish)|disabilities]] that condition carried with it.

==Help from and to Jews abroad==
[[William III of England|William III]] is reported to have been assisted in his ascent to the English throne by a loan of 2,000,000 [[guilders]] from [[Antonio Lopez Suasso]] (1614–1685) (of the well-known [[Lopes Suasso]] family), later made first Baron [[d'Avernas le Gras]] by [[Charles II of Spain]]. William did not interfere when in 1689 some of the chief Jewish merchants of London were forced to pay the duty levied on the goods of aliens, but he refused a petition from [[Jamaica]] to expel the Jews. William's reign brought about a closer connection between the predominantly Sephardic communities of London and Amsterdam; this aided in the transfer of the European finance centre from the Dutch capital to the English capital. Over this time a small [[German people|German]] [[Ashkenazi]] community had arrived and established their own [[synagogue]] in 1692, but they were of little mercantile consequence, and did not figure in the relations between the established Jewish community and the government.

Early in the eighteenth century the Jewish community of London comprised representatives of the chief Jewish financiers in northern [[Europe]]; these included the [[Mendez da Costa]], [[Abudiente]], [[Joseph Salvador|Salvador]], [[Lopez]], Fonseca, and [[Seixas]] families. The utility of these prominent Jewish merchants and financiers was widely recognised. [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Marlborough]] in particular made great use of the services of Sir [[Solomon de Medina]], and indeed was publicly charged with taking an annual [[subvention]] from him. The early merchants of the resettlement are estimated to have brought with them a capital of £1,500,000 into the country; this amount is estimated to have increased to £5,000,000 by the middle of the 18th century.

As early as 1723 an act of Parliament allowed Jews holding land to omit the words "on the true faith of a Christian", when registering their title.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cecil Roth]], ''A History Of The Jews In England'' (1941), [http://www.iamthewitness.com/books/Cecil.Roth/A.History.of.the.Jews.in.England/P.09.The.Jews.under.Anne.and.the.First.Hanoverians.1702-60.htm accessible here] "An Act of 1722, which added to Roman Catholic disabilities by enforcing the Oath of Abjuration on all landowners, was followed the next year by a further measure (to George I, cap. 4) exempting Jews from the necessity of including in it the words 'on the true faith of a Christian';"&lt;/ref&gt; Only once more would this allowance be made&lt;ref name="Henriq-PREJ"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Henriques |first=H.

Shortly afterwards a similar bill was introduced into the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]], where it passed the [[Irish House of Commons|Commons]] in 1745 and 1746, but failed to pass the [[Irish House of Lords|Lords]] in 1747; it was ultimately dropped. Meanwhile, during the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] rising of 1745 the Jews had shown particular loyalty to the government. Their chief financier, [[Samson Gideon]], had strengthened the stock market, and several of the younger members had volunteered in the corps raised to defend London.

'''Social tuning''', the process whereby people adopt other people's attitudes, is cited by social psychologists to demonstrate an important lack of people's conscious control over their actions.

The process of social tuning is particularly powerful in situations where one person wants to be liked or accepted by another person or group. However, social tuning occurs both when people meet for the first time, as well as among people who know each other well.  Social tuning occurs both consciously and subconsciously. As research continues, the application of the theory of social tuning broadens.

[[Social psychology]] bases many of its concepts on the belief that a person's [[self concept]] is shaped by the people with whom he or she interacts. Social tuning allows people to learn about themselves and the social world through their interactions with others. People mold their own views to match those of the people surrounding them through social tuning in order to develop meaningful relationships. These relationships then play an integral role in developing one's self-esteem and self-concept.

==Theoretical approaches==

Social tuning theory describes the process whereby people adopt another person's attitudes or opinions regarding a particular subject. This phenomenon is also termed  "shared reality theory." The study of this occurrence began in 1902 when [[Charles Cooley]] coined the term "[[looking glass self]]", stating that people see themselves and their own social world through the eyes of others. Research further discovered that people create their self-images through their beliefs of how others perceive them. Many people adopt the views of those surrounding them in an effort to feel like they belong and feel liked. In 1934, Mead determined that not only do individuals shape their self-concepts according to the perspectives of others, but also that people's views of themselves are continually maintained according to these adopted ideas.&lt;ref name="Stigma and Group Inequality"&gt;{{cite book|last=Laar|first=edited by Shana Levin, Colette van|title=Stigma and group inequality : social psychological perspectives|year=2006|publisher=L. Erlbaum|location=Mahwah (NJ)|isbn=978-0-8058-4416-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later research showed that social tuning tends to be a particularly strong phenomenon when two people want to get along with each other. This is shown through social bonds which can be strengthened and reinforced through a perceived sense of shared beliefs.&lt;ref name="Hardin &amp; Conley, 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hardin|first=C. D.|author2=Conley, T.D. |title=A relational approach to cognition: Shared experience and relationship affirmation in social cognition.|journal=Cognitive social psychology: The Princeton Symposium on the Legacy and Future of Social Cognition.|year=2001|pages=3–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sinclair hardin lowery 2005 the role of affiliative motivation"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sinclair|first=Stacey|author2=Lowery, B.S. |author3=Hardin, C.D. |author4=Colangelo, A. |title=Social Tuning of Automatic Racial Attitudes: The Role of Affiliative Motivation|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2005|volume=89|issue=4|pages=583–592|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.89.4.583 |pmid=16287420}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, these shared ideas create a person's comprehension of their environment and world as a whole.  Individuals believe that they have the same attitudes regarding certain ideas and experiences as the other.

One particular aspect of  social tuning, [[stereotyping]], has been a popular theme in this field's research over time. One specific method explores the idea that individuals of a certain group are influenced by the ideas of others from the out-group (Crocker, Major &amp; Steele, 1998).  These interactions yield the particular stereotyped group to internalize and believe the way others view them.  Therefore, self-stereotyping manifests in certain individuals.&lt;ref name="Stigma and Group Inequality" /&gt;  However, in this case, the presence of self-stereotyping is immensely determined by the relationship with whom the stereotyped individual interacts with.&lt;ref name="Stigma and Group Inequality" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hardin &amp; Conley, 2001" /&gt;

In 2006, Sinclair and Huntsinger explored the idea of why other people will change their beliefs and attitudes in order to get along with others and feel accepted. Their research focuses on why individuals from targeted groups will act and behave according to "cultural stereotypes". They used two [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] originally coined  by Hardin &amp; Conley in 2001,  "Affiliative Social-Tuning" and "Domain Relevance Hypothesis".&lt;ref name="Hardin &amp; Conley, 2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sicnclair &amp; huntsinger 2006" /&gt; The first of these, "Affiliative Social-Tuning Hypothesis", pertains to the idea that certain concepts will be shared between individuals especially when affiliative [[motivation]] is high. For example, in a situation with a member from a targeted group and a member from a neutral group, the former will act accordingly to how the latter stereotypes his group. However, this is contingent on the fact that affiliative motivation is high, in other words, if there is a desire for the former to create a bond with the latter.&lt;ref name="sicnclair &amp; huntsinger 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sinclair|first=S.|author2=Huntsinger J |title=The Interpersonal Basis of Self Stereotyping|journal=Stigma and Group Inequality: Social Psychological Perspectives|year=2006|pages=Chapter 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The second, "Domain Relevance Hypothesis", explains that "when confronted with multiple applicable views on which to construct a shared understanding with another person, an individual will choose to social tune toward only those views that will lead to the development of the most precise shared understanding with the person".&lt;ref name="sicnclair &amp; huntsinger 2006" /&gt; In other words, when many views are available to be socially tuned between individuals, only certain concepts will be shared. The concepts chosen are the ideas that yield the best common understanding between the two individuals.&lt;ref name="Stigma and Group Inequality" /&gt;

==Empirical approaches==

One of the most famous experiments demonstrating the social tuning phenomenon was done by Stacy Sinclair.&lt;ref name="sinclair hardin lowery 2005 the role of affiliative motivation" /&gt;  Her research reveals the effect of likability on people's drive to social tune. Participants engaged with researchers who were either likable or non-likable and who were either wearing a shirt stating anti-racist thoughts, specifically a shirt with the word "Eracism", or a blank shirt. The participants were then asked to complete a subconscious [[prejudice]] test, and when the researcher was likable, participants demonstrated significantly less racist attitudes on the test, than if that researcher was unlikable. Since the participants seemed to shape their views to that of the experimenter only when he or she was "likable", this study can be shown to reveal that people are more prone to adopt the views of others through social tuning when they like that person. This aspect of social tuning could be explained by the psychological assumption that people want to be liked by those that they themselves like, and therefore people will shape their views to match those of a person from whom they seek social acceptance.&lt;ref name="sinclair hardin lowery 2005 the role of affiliative motivation" /&gt;

A similar study by Janetta Lun demonstrates another aspect of social tuning with respect to [[racism]], and suggests that people who do not already hold strong beliefs about social prejudice are more likely to socially tune their beliefs with others around them than those who do already hold strong opinions.&lt;ref name="Lun janetta 2007 why do I think what you think"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lun|first=Janetta|title=(Why) do I think what you think ? Epistemic Social Tuning and Implicit Prejudice|journal=Journal of Psychology and Social Psychology|year=2007|volume=93|pages=957–972|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.93.6.957}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this study, participants were given an [[implicit attitude]] test to determine their existing levels of implicit prejudice. Next they were taken into another room with either an experimenter who had the word "ERACISM"  on their shirt, or with an experimenter in a plain T-shirt for the control condition. In the first condition, participants were asked to read the word "ERACISM" off the experimenter's T-shirt, and then in the control they were asked to read a series of nonsense letters. They were then given another implicit attitudes test to determine their implicit prejudice.

Lun found that people who had less accessible attitudes (determined by the first implicit attitudes test) had lower implicit prejudice after interacting with the experimenter who held clear [[egalitarian]] views. Alternatively, those who already held strong beliefs about prejudice did not change their implicit prejudice after interacting with the egalitarian experimenter. 
This study demonstrates that when individuals do not hold already strong beliefs, they are more likely to seek knowledge from those around them, and therefore more likely to engage in social tuning.&lt;ref name="Lun janetta 2007 why do I think what you think" /&gt; Lun's experiment suggests the likelihood of social tuning when people seek knowledge on a particular subject. In this case, the participants who did not hold strong opinions on the subject of prejudice, and thus presumably had less knowledge on the subject, molded their opinions to match the information they were given by the experimenter in the form of the word "ERACISM" on her shirt, and therefore they demonstrated stronger egalitarian views than they had when initially arriving at the experiment. People who are uncomfortable in situations where they feel they do not have enough information will attempt to get information through their interactions with others. Lun's experiment reveals how social tuning is a part of such a process, in which people with less knowledge are more likely to mold their beliefs to that of others.

Further research by Aaron Root has been completed, examining opinions on homosexuality. During this experiment, the researcher, who always wore a pro-homosexuality shirt, followed a script that was designed to control the participant's desire to get along with the researcher. In the high-level condition, the experimenter was friendly and amiable; he offered candy at the beginning of the study and spoke enthusiastically about the experiment. In the low-level condition, the experimenter's dialogue was concise (to the point of rudeness) and he even made a point of putting away the candy basket without offering any. To emphasize this action, the experimenter made a comment about not knowing why the other experimenters insisted on giving candy out. In the trials with an amicable experimenter, the participants were more gay-friendly on the implicit attitudes tests. The opposite resulted from the interaction with a less-likable experimenter. The subject would adopt the views of the message printed on the experimenter's shirt if he was nicer.&lt;ref name="root aaron effects of affiliative motivation and perspective"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Root|first=Aaron|title=The Effects of Affiliative Motivation and Perspective Taking on Social Tuning|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Curtis Hardin, co-author of "Shared Reality, System Justification, and the Relational Basis of Ideological Beliefs", has performed numerous experiments in social tuning across a wide variety of ideals.&lt;ref name="Hardin &amp; Conley, 2001" /&gt; His experiments explore how individual experience reflects a kind of tension among relationships. In one experiment, automatic homophobic attitudes manifest in the participant after an interaction with an evidently gay experimenter, but only for subjects who do not have gay friends. In another study by Hardin, unconscious threats to religious experience reduce commitment for participants who do not share the experience with their father or minister. For those who do perceive the religious experience to be shared, the unconscious threat causes increased religious commitment. In a third study, people become more anti-black when they are included (as opposed to excluded) in a game played with ostensible racists. The effect is reversed when the participants have are{{Clarify|date=May 2012}} extra motivated to engage with the racists. Similar studies have been performed with gender.&lt;ref name="Social Tuning and Ideology"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sahlstrom|first=Al|title=Social Tuning and Ideology|url=http://thesituationist.wordpress.com/2009/01/25/social-tuning-and-ideology-part-i/|accessdate=2010-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an experiment by Hardin and Higgins (1996), participants were given information about a "target" which they would inform a perceived audience about.&lt;ref name="Hardins &amp; higgins 1996 shared reality"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hardins|first=C.D.|author2=Higgins, E.T. |title=Shared reality: How social verification makes the subjective objective|journal=Handbook of motivation and cognition: The interpersonal context|year=1996|volume=3|pages=28–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "communicators" changed the different summaries of information (sometimes to incorrect information) to best correspond with the attitudes of the audience which they were informed of by the researchers. The motivation of the communicator determined the extent to which they would alter their message to suit the audience. However, the communicator soon began believing their edited information about the target as a direct source of information. The memory and beliefs towards the target were then influenced. As time passed, communicators' belief that their message as a source of information about the target increased and their memory was altered. Thus the communicator adopted the believed beliefs of the audience which he was trying to inform.&lt;ref name="Hardins &amp; higgins 1996 shared reality" /&gt;

==Applications==

Social tuning has resounding influences on both the memory and cognition of those affected by this process. Though social tuning could potentially aid memory and cognition should the views of the other person be correct, this phenomenon could also impede memory and cause incorrect cognition. For example, if an individual seeks a relationship with another individual who holds negative opinions about homosexuality, the first individual could be at risk for mirroring those negative opinions in order to be liked by the second individual. Such phenomenon can be harmful, in that they can cause people to hold opinions on subjects that are not based on concrete information, but on the opinions of others.

==Controversies==

Social tuning can be particularly strong when in relation to controversial topics. Judgments based on sexual orientation, race, religion and even a politics can be substantially altered based on the opinions of those around a subject. The result being that it is not only highly unlikely that a subject would openly disagree with these feelings, but actually adopt them and proclaim them as genuinely their own.  In addition, social tuning is a large contributor to prejudice and racism. For example, many individuals adopt their views about race or about their out-groups according to the ideas of those surrounding them. Social tuning with respect to race often occurs through parental influence. A child without sufficient information about race, and who seeks the approval of his or her parent will likely shape their own beliefs about race based on the beliefs of their parents.

As noted earlier (see "Major Theoretical Approaches"), self tuning has been linked to many issues regarding [[stereotyping]].  For example,  individuals of commonly stereotyped groups are at risk of social tuning in certain situations. For example, [[Michael Inzlicht]] coined the term "threatening environments", which pertain to occasions when individuals perceive that they are being "devalued, stigmatized, or discriminated against" by a non-stereotyped group.&lt;ref name="Inzlicht Good"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Inzlicht|first=Michael|author2=Aronson, J. |author3=Good, C. |author4=McKay, L. |title=A particular resiliency to threatening environments|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|year=2006|volume=42|pages=323–336|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2005.05.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stigma and Group Inequality" /&gt; In this environment, it is common that the individuals of a perceived "lower-status" will social tune to the ideas of the "higher-status".  This results in internalized racism of the former group.&lt;ref name="sicnclair &amp; huntsinger 2006" /&gt; However, it has been noted that under certain conditions interactions between heterogeneous groups can result more in a more positive manner.  For example, situations that are perceived as "safe and nonthreatening", by both the stigmatized and non-stigmatized group "are likely to lead to positive self-expansion and social tuning, reduced prejudice and discrimination, and positive group attitudes".&lt;ref name="Stigma and Group Inequality" /&gt;

On the other hand, research has showed that self tuning to ideas of one's ingroup, and not one's outgroup can often lead to more damaging results (7).&lt;ref name="Stigma and Group Inequality" /&gt;  Due to the fact that members of the same group are closer and trust one another, they are more likely to tune to the ideas of each other.  Therefore, a member that holds a negative self-stereotype of himself and his own group is more dangerous to his comrades than an individual on the outside who shares the same views.&lt;ref name="Stigma and Group Inequality" /&gt; Research has been conducted on how an individual from a stereotyped group can best avoid the dangers of self-tuning from an out-group. As Sinclair suggests, "members of stigmatized groups need to be careful with whom they develop relationships", and thus they "can reduce the likelihood of negative social tuning by remaining interpersonally distant from those with stereotypical views".&lt;ref name="sicnclair &amp; huntsinger 2006" /&gt;

==Conclusion==

Social tuning is an intriguing social phenomenon that affects our personal beliefs and views both on a long-term and short-term basis. It impacts many important aspects of an individual's life, and can even play a role in determining a person's beliefs on a variety of important subjects.  For example, it plays a large role in our self-concept and our views of others. There are certain situations which heighten the likelihood that a person will engage in social tuning, for example when an individual wants to be liked by another or when an individual does not already hold strong opinions on a subject.  Overall, social tuning is an important social psychological theory as it explains the many beliefs we hold about ourselves, others, and the world around us.

Frank describes his work as "poorly drawn cartoons inspired by actual spam subject lines."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/26/technology/online-diary.html |title=Online Diary |last=Napoli |first=Lisa |date=August 26, 2004 |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.computerworld.com/node/141 |title=IT Blogwatch: Email Tyranny, HP's Q2, Outlook Tips, and more... |last=Jennings |first=Richi |date=May 18, 2005 |work=Computer World |accessdate=December 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; To draw the comics, Frank uses a [[Wacom (company)|Wacom]] [[graphics tablet]] to sketch his ideas freehand into his computer, using the application [[Adobe Photoshop Elements]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |work=How |title=For Your Spamusement |page=22 |volume=20 |number=1 |year=2005 |publisher=RC Communications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frank's cartoons have occasionally featured repeating characters such Cabinet Sanchez, Eggplant Mike and Troy Powell.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spamusers.com/Wiki/index.php?title=Cabinet_Sanchez Cabinet Sanchez], [http://spamusers.com/Wiki/index.php?title=Troy_Powell Troy Powell], {{cite web |url=http://www.spamusers.com/Wiki/index.php?title=Eggplant_Mike |title=Eggplant Mike |work=Spamusement!

He published it on July 23, 2004.

The ''Spamusement!'' site also features forums, one section of which allows readers to create their own spam-inspired comics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://appscout.pcmag.com/e-mail/275315-turning-spam-into-entertainment |title=Turning Spam Into Entertainment |last=Henry |first=Alan |work=Appscout: Stalking the Killer App |publisher=PC Magazine / Ziff Davis Inc. |date=May 9, 2008 |accessdate=December 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frank did not contribute for three months in early 2006, then posted irregularly from June 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/table_of_malcontents/2006/06/spambased_webco/ |title=Spam-Based Webcomic |author=Wired blogs |work=Wired |date=June 29, 2006 |accessdate=December 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since October 2006, Frank completely turned over the responsibility of comic-making to the forums, although another original comic by Frank appeared on the site in late June 2007.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28035">The '''standard solar model''' (SSM) is a mathematical treatment of the [[Sun]] as a [[spherical]] ball of gas (in varying states of [[ionisation]], with the hydrogen in the deep interior being a completely ionised [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]). This [[stellar model|model]], technically the [[spherically symmetric]] [[Quasistatic equilibrium|quasi-static]] model of a star, has [[stellar structure]] described by several differential equations derived from basic physical principles. The model is constrained by [[boundary conditions]], namely the luminosity, radius, age and composition of the Sun, which are well determined. The age of the Sun cannot be measured directly; one way to estimate it is from the age of the oldest meteorites, and models of the evolution of the Solar System.&lt;ref name="Guenther 1995"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; All heavier elements, called ''[[metallicity|metals]]'' in astronomy, account for less than 2&amp;nbsp;percent of the mass. The SSM is used to test the validity of stellar evolution theory. In fact, the only way to determine the two free parameters of the stellar evolution model, the helium abundance and the [[mixing length theory|mixing length]] parameter (used to model convection in the Sun), are to adjust the SSM to "fit" the observed Sun.

==A calibrated solar model==
A star is considered to be at zero age (protostellar) when it is assumed to have a homogeneous composition and to be just beginning to derive most of its luminosity from nuclear reactions (so neglecting the period of contraction from a cloud of gas and dust). To obtain the SSM, a one [[solar mass]] ({{Solar mass|link=y}}) stellar model at zero age is [[stellar evolution|evolved]] numerically to the age of the Sun. The abundance of elements in the zero age solar model is estimated from primordial meteorites.&lt;ref name=lodders/&gt; Along with this abundance information, a reasonable guess at the zero-age luminosity (such as the present-day Sun's luminosity) is then converted by an iterative procedure into the correct value for the model, and the temperature, pressure and density throughout the model calculated by solving the equations of stellar structure numerically assuming the star to be in a [[steady state]]. The model is then evolved numerically up to the age of the Sun. Any discrepancy from the measured values of the Sun's luminosity, surface abundances, etc. can then be used to refine the model. For example, since the Sun formed, some of the helium and heavy elements have settled out of the photosphere by diffusion. As a result, the Solar photosphere now contains about 87% as much helium and heavy elements as the protostellar photosphere had; the protostellar Solar photosphere was 71.1% hydrogen, 27.4% helium, and 1.5% metals.&lt;ref name=lodders/&gt; A measure of heavy-element settling by diffusion is required for a more accurate model.

==Numerical modelling of the stellar structure equations==
{{Main|stellar structure}}
The differential equations of stellar structure, such as the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium, are integrated numerically. The differential equations are approximated by [[difference equations]]. The star is imagined to be made up of spherically symmetric shells and the numerical integration carried out in finite steps making use of the [[equation of state|equations of state]], giving relationships for the pressure, the opacity and the energy generation rate in terms of the density, temperature and composition.&lt;ref name="Ostlie"&gt;Ostlie, Dale A. and Carrol, Bradley W., [https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Modern-Astrophysics-Bradley-Carroll/dp/0805304029/ref=pd_bxgy_b_text_b ''An introduction to Modern Stellar Astrophysics''], Addison-Wesley (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution of the Sun==
{{Main|stellar evolution}}{{See also|sun}}
Nuclear reactions in the core of the Sun change its composition, by converting [[hydrogen]] nuclei into [[helium]] nuclei by the [[proton-proton chain]] and (to a lesser extent in the Sun than in more massive stars) the [[CNO cycle]]. This increases the mean molecular weight in the core of the Sun, which should lead to a decrease in pressure. This does not happen as instead the core contracts. By the [[Virial theorem|virial theorem]] half of the gravitational [[potential energy]] released by this contraction goes towards raising the temperature of the core, and the other half is radiated away.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} This increase in temperature also increases the pressure and restores the balance of [[hydrostatic equilibrium]]. The luminosity of the Sun is increased by the temperature rise, increasing the rate of nuclear reactions. The outer layers expand to compensate for the increased temperature and pressure gradients, so the radius also increases.&lt;ref name="Ostlie"/&gt;

No star is completely static, but stars stay on the main sequence (burning hydrogen in the core) for long periods. In the case of the Sun, it has been on the main sequence for roughly 4.6 billion years, and will become a red giant in roughly 6.5 billion years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Thus the assumption of [[steady state]] is a very good approximation{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}. For simplicity, the stellar structure equations are written without explicit time dependence, with the exception of the luminosity gradient equation:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dL}{dr} = 4 \pi r^2 \rho \left( \epsilon - \epsilon_\nu \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Here L is the luminosity, ε is the nuclear energy generation rate per unit mass and ε&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt; is the luminosity due to neutrino emission (see [[#Energy transport in the Sun|below]] for the other quantities). The slow evolution of the Sun on the main sequence is then determined by the change in the nuclear species (principally hydrogen being consumed and helium being produced). The rates of the various nuclear reactions are estimated from particle physics experiments at high energies, which are extrapolated back to the lower energies of stellar interiors (the Sun burns hydrogen rather slowly). Historically, errors in the nuclear reaction rates have been one of the biggest sources of error in stellar modelling. Computers are employed to calculate the varying abundances (usually by mass fraction) of the nuclear species. A particular species will have a rate of production and a rate of destruction, so both are needed to calculate its abundance over time, at varying conditions of temperature and density. Since there are many nuclear species, a computerised [[reaction network]] is needed to keep track of how all the abundances vary together.

According to the [[Vogt-Russell theorem]], the mass and the composition structure throughout a star uniquely determine its radius, luminosity, and internal structure, as well as its subsequent evolution (though this "theorem" was only intended to apply to the slow, stable phases of stellar evolution and certainly does not apply to the transitions between stages and rapid evolutionary stages).&lt;ref name="Ostlie"/&gt;
The information about the varying abundances of nuclear species over time, along with the equations of state, is sufficient for a numerical solution by taking sufficiently small time increments and using iteration to find the unique internal structure of the star at each stage.

==Purpose of the standard solar model==
The SSM serves two purposes:
* it provides estimates for the helium abundance and mixing length parameter by forcing the stellar model to have the correct luminosity and radius at the Sun's age,
* it provides a way to evaluate more complex models with additional physics, such as rotation, magnetic fields and diffusion or improvements to the treatment of convection, such as modelling turbulence, and convective overshooting.

Like the [[Standard Model]] of [[particle physics]] and the [[physical cosmology|standard cosmology]] model the SSM changes over time in response to relevant new [[theoretical physics|theoretical]] or [[experimental physics]] discoveries.

==Energy transport in the Sun==
As described in the [[Sun]] article, the Sun has a radiative core and a convective outer envelope. In the core, the luminosity due to nuclear reactions is transmitted to outer layers principally by radiation. However, in the outer layers the temperature gradient is so great that radiation cannot transport enough energy. As a result, thermal convection occurs as thermal columns carry hot material to the surface (photosphere) of the Sun. Once the material cools off at the surface, it plunges back downward to the base of the convection zone, to receive more heat from the top of the radiative zone.

In a solar model, as described in [[stellar structure]], one considers the [[density]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\rho(r)&lt;/math&gt;, [[temperature]] T(r), total [[pressure]] (matter plus radiation) P(r), [[luminosity]] l(r) and energy generation rate per unit mass ε(r) in a spherical shell of a thickness dr at a distance r from the center of the star.

Radiative transport of energy is described by the radiative temperature gradient equation:
:&lt;math&gt; {\mbox{d} T \over \mbox{d} r} = - {3 \kappa \rho l \over 16 \pi r^2 \sigma T^3},&lt;/math&gt;
where κ is the [[opacity (optics)|opacity]] of the matter, σ is the [[Stefan-Boltzmann constant]], and the [[Boltzmann constant]] is set to one.

Convection is described using [[mixing length theory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hansen | last2=Kawaler | last3=Trimble | first=Carl J. | first2=Steven D. | first3=Virginia | publisher=Springer | edition=2nd | date=2004 | title=Stellar Interiors | isbn=0-387-20089-4|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the corresponding temperature gradient equation (for [[adiabatic process|adiabatic]] convection) is:
:&lt;math&gt; {\mbox{d} T \over \mbox{d} r} = \left(1 - {1 \over \gamma} \right) {T \over P } { \mbox{d} P \over \mbox{d} r},&lt;/math&gt;
where γ = c&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; / c&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[adiabatic index]], the ratio of [[specific heat]]s in the gas. (For a fully ionized [[ideal gas]], γ = 5/3.)

Near the base of the Sun's convection zone, the convection is adiabatic, but near the surface of the Sun, convection is not adiabatic.

==Simulations of near-surface convection==
A more realistic description of the uppermost part of the convection zone is possible through detailed three-dimensional and time-dependent [[fluid dynamics|hydrodynamical]] simulations, taking into account [[radiative transfer]] in the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Equations of state==
The numerical solution of the differential equations of stellar structure requires [[equation of state|equations of state]] for the pressure, opacity and energy generation rate, as described in [[stellar structure]], which relate these variables to the density, temperature and composition.

==Helioseismology==
{{Main|Helioseismology}}

Helioseismology is the study of the wave oscillations in the Sun. Changes in the propagation of these waves through the Sun reveal inner structures and allow astrophysicists to develop extremely detailed profiles of the interior conditions of the Sun. In particular, the location of the convection zone in the outer layers of the Sun can be measured, and information about the core of the Sun provides a method, using the SSM, to calculate the age of the Sun, independently of the method of inferring the age of the Sun from that of the oldest meteorites.&lt;ref name="bonannoetal2002"&gt;{{cite journal

==Neutrino production==

Hydrogen is fused into helium through several different interactions in the Sun.  The vast majority of [[neutrino]]s are produced through the [[pp chain]], a process in which four protons are combined to produce two [[proton]]s, two [[neutron]]s, two [[positron]]s, and two electron neutrinos.  Neutrinos are also produced by the [[CNO cycle]], but that process is considerably less important in the Sun than in other stars.

Most of the neutrinos produced in the Sun come from the first step of the pp chain but their energy is so low (&lt;0.425 [[MeV]])&lt;ref name="Bahcall"&gt;
{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; they are very difficult to detect.  A rare side branch of the pp chain produces the "[[boron]]-8" neutrinos with a maximum energy of roughly 15 MeV, and these are the easiest neutrinos to detect.  A very rare interaction in the pp chain produces the [[Proton–proton chain reaction#The pp IV .28Hep.29 branch|"hep" neutrinos]], the highest energy neutrinos predicted to be produced by the Sun.  They are predicted to have a maximum energy of about 18 MeV.

All of the interactions described above produce neutrinos with a [[spectrum]] of energies.  The [[electron capture]] of &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Be produces neutrinos at either roughly 0.862 MeV (~90%) or 0.384 MeV (~10%).&lt;ref name="Bahcall"/&gt;

==Neutrino detection==
The weakness of the neutrino's interactions with other particles means that most neutrinos produced in the core of the Sun can [[Transparency (optics)|pass all the way through the Sun without being absorbed]]. It is possible, therefore, to observe the core of the Sun directly by detecting these neutrinos.

===History===
{{Main|solar neutrino problem}}

The first experiment to successfully detect cosmic neutrinos was [[Raymond Davis Jr.|Ray Davis's]] [[Homestake Experiment|chlorine experiment]], in which neutrinos were detected by observing the [[Nuclear transmutation|conversion]] of [[chlorine]] [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] to radioactive [[argon]] in a large [[Chemical tank|tank]] of [[perchloroethylene]]. This was a reaction channel expected for neutrinos, but since only the number of argon decays was counted, it did not give any directional information, such as where the neutrinos came from. The experiment found about 1/3 as many neutrinos as were predicted by the standard solar model of the time, and this problem became known as the [[solar neutrino problem]].

While it is now known that the chlorine experiment detected neutrinos, some physicists at the time were suspicious of the experiment, mainly because they did not trust such radiochemical techniques. Unambiguous detection of solar neutrinos was provided by the [[Kamiokande-II]] experiment, a [[water]] [[Cerenkov]] detector with a low enough energy threshold to detect neutrinos through neutrino-electron [[elastic scattering]]. In the elastic scattering interaction the electrons coming out of the point of reaction strongly point in the direction that the neutrino was travelling, away from the Sun. This ability to "point back" at the Sun was the first conclusive evidence that the Sun is powered by nuclear interactions in the core. While the neutrinos observed in Kamiokande-II were clearly from the Sun, the rate of neutrino interactions was again suppressed compared to theory at the time. Even worse, the Kamiokande-II experiment measured about 1/2 the predicted flux, rather than the chlorine experiment's 1/3.

The solution to the solar neutrino problem was finally experimentally determined by the [[Sudbury Neutrino Observatory]] (SNO). The radiochemical experiments were only sensitive to electron neutrinos, and the signal in the water Cerenkov experiments was dominated by the electron neutrino signal. The SNO experiment, by contrast, had sensitivity to all three neutrino flavours. By simultaneously measuring the electron neutrino and total neutrino fluxes the experiment demonstrated that the suppression was due to the [[MSW effect]], the conversion of electron neutrinos from their pure flavour state into the second neutrino mass eigenstate as they passed through a [[resonance]] due to the changing density of the Sun. The resonance is energy dependent, and "turns on" near 2MeV.&lt;ref name="Bahcall"/&gt; The water Cerenkov detectors only detect neutrinos above about 5MeV, while the radiochemical experiments were sensitive to lower energy (0.8MeV for [[chlorine]], 0.2MeV for [[gallium]]), and this turned out to be the source of the difference in the observed neutrino rates at the two types of experiments.

===Proton–proton chain===
All neutrinos from the [[proton–proton chain reaction]] (PP neutrinos) have been detected except hep neutrinos (next point). Three techniques have been adopted: The radiochemical technique, used by [[Homestake experiment|Homestake]], [[Gallex]], [[Gallium Neutrino Observatory|GNO]] and [[SAGE (Soviet–American Gallium Experiment)|SAGE]] allowed  to measure the neutrino flux above a minimum energy. The detector SNO used scattering on deuterium that allowed to measure the energy of the events, thereby identifying the single components of the predicted SSM neutrino emission. Finally,  [[Kamiokande]], [[Super-Kamiokande]], SNO, [[Borexino]] and [[KamLAND]] used elastic scattering on electrons, which allows the measurement of the neutrino energy. Boron8 neutrinos have been seen by Kamiokande, Super-Kamiokande, SNO, Borexino, KamLAND. Beryllium7, pep, and PP neutrinos have been seen only by Borexino to date.

===hep neutrinos===
The highest energy neutrinos have not yet been observed due to their small flux compared to the boron-8 neutrinos, so thus far only limits have been placed on the flux. No experiment yet has had enough [[Sensitivity (electronics)|sensitivity]] to observe the flux predicted by the SSM.

===CNO cycle===
Neutrinos from the [[CNO cycle]] of solar energy generation – i.e., the CNO-neutrinos –  are also expected to provide observable events below 1 MeV. They have not yet been observed due to experimental noise (background). Ultra-pure scintillator detectors have the potential to probe the flux predicted by the SSM. This detection could be possible already in [[Borexino]]; the next scientific occasions will be in SNO+ and, on the longer term, in LENA and JUNO, three detectors that will be larger but will use the same principles of Borexino.

===Future experiments===
While radiochemical experiments have in some sense observed the pp and Be7 neutrinos they have measured only integral fluxes. The "[[holy grail]]" of solar neutrino experiments would detect the Be7 neutrinos with a detector that is sensitive to the individual neutrino energies.  This experiment would test the MSW hypothesis by searching for the turn-on of the MSW effect. Some [[Exotic matter|exotic]] models are still capable of explaining the solar neutrino deficit, so the observation of the MSW turn on would, in effect, finally solve the solar neutrino problem.

==Core temperature prediction==
The flux of boron-8 neutrinos is highly sensitive to the temperature of the core of the Sun, &lt;math&gt;\phi(^8B) \propto T^{25}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Bahcall Tsun"&gt;

It is hypothesised that the presence of planets may increase the amount of mixing and deepen the convective zone to such an extent that the Li can be burned.

{{General relativity sidebar}}

The '''stress–energy tensor''', sometimes '''stress–energy–momentum tensor''' or '''energy–momentum tensor''', is a [[tensor]] quantity in [[physics]] that describes the [[density]] and [[flux]] of [[energy]] and [[momentum]] in [[spacetime]], generalizing the [[Cauchy stress tensor|stress tensor]] of [[Newtonian physics]]. It is an attribute of [[matter]], [[radiation]], and non-gravitational [[force field (physics)|force field]]s. The stress–energy tensor is the source of the [[gravitational field]] in the [[Einstein field equations]] of [[general relativity]], just as mass density is the source of such a field in [[Newtonian gravity]].

==Definition==
The stress–energy tensor involves the use of superscripted variables (''not'' exponents; see [[tensor index notation]] and [[Einstein notation|Einstein summation notation]]). If [[Cartesian coordinates]] in [[SI units]] are used, then the components of the position [[four-vector]] are given by: {{nowrap|1=''x''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = ''t''}}, {{nowrap|1=''x''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x''}}, {{nowrap|1=''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''y''}}, and {{nowrap|1=''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = ''z''}}, where ''t'' is time in seconds, and ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' are distances in meters.

The stress–energy tensor is defined as the [[tensor]] ''T''&lt;sup&gt;''αβ''&lt;/sup&gt; of order two that gives the [[flux]] of the ''α''th component of the [[momentum]] [[vector (geometric)|vector]] across a surface with constant ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''β''&lt;/sup&gt; [[coordinate]]. In the theory of [[general relativity|relativity]], this momentum vector is taken as the [[four-momentum]]. In general relativity, the stress–energy tensor is symmetric,&lt;ref&gt;On pp. 141–142 of [[Gravitation (book)|Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler]], section 5.7 "Symmetry of the Stress–Energy Tensor" begins with "All the stress–energy tensors explored above were symmetric. That they could not have been otherwise one sees as follows."&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;T^{\alpha \beta} = T^{\beta \alpha}.&lt;/math&gt;

In some alternative theories like [[Einstein–Cartan theory]], the stress–energy tensor may not be perfectly symmetric because of a nonzero [[spin tensor]], which geometrically corresponds to a nonzero [[torsion tensor]].

==Identifying the components of the tensor==
Because the stress–energy tensor is of order two, its components can be displayed in 4&amp;thinsp;×&amp;thinsp;4 matrix form:
:&lt;math&gt;
(T^{\mu\nu})_{\mu,\nu=0,1,2,3} = \begin{pmatrix} T^{00} &amp; T^{01} &amp; T^{02} &amp; T^{03} \\ T^{10} &amp; T^{11} &amp; T^{12} &amp; T^{13} \\ T^{20} &amp; T^{21} &amp; T^{22} &amp; T^{23} \\ T^{30} &amp; T^{31} &amp; T^{32} &amp; T^{33} \end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

In the following, ''i'' and ''k'' range from 1 through 3.

The time–time component is the density of relativistic mass, i.e. the [[energy density]] divided by the speed of light squared.&lt;ref&gt;Charles W., Misner, Thorne, Kip S., Wheeler, John A., (1973). Gravitation. San Frandisco: W. H. Freeman and Company. {{ISBN|0-7167-0334-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Its components have a direct physical interpretation. In the case of a perfect fluid this component is
:&lt;math&gt;T^{00} = \rho,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the [[relativistic mass]] per unit volume, and for an electromagnetic field in otherwise empty space this component is
:&lt;math&gt;T^{00} = {1 \over c^2}\left(\frac{1}{2} \epsilon_0 E^2 + \frac{1}{2\mu_0} B^2 \right),&lt;/math&gt;

where ''E'' and ''B'' are the electric and magnetic fields, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;d'Inverno, R.A, (1992). Introducing Einstein's Relativity. New York: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-859686-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The flux of relativistic mass across the ''x&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;'' surface is equivalent to the density of the ''i''th component of linear momentum,
:&lt;math&gt;T^{0i} = T^{i0}.&lt;/math&gt;

The components
:&lt;math&gt; T^{ik}&lt;/math&gt;
represent flux of ''i''th component of linear momentum across the ''x&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;'' surface.  In particular,
:&lt;math&gt; T^{ii}&lt;/math&gt;
(not summed) represents [[tensile stress|normal stress]], which is called [[pressure]] when it is independent of direction. The remaining components
:&lt;math&gt; T^{ik} \quad i \ne k &lt;/math&gt;
represent [[shear stress]] (compare with the [[stress (physics)|stress tensor]]).

In [[solid state physics]] and [[fluid mechanics]], the stress tensor is defined to be the spatial components of the stress–energy tensor in the [[proper frame]] of reference. In other words, the stress energy tensor in [[engineering]] ''differs'' from the stress–energy tensor here by a momentum convective term.

===Covariant and mixed forms===

In most of this article we work with the contravariant form, ''T''&lt;sup&gt;''μν''&lt;/sup&gt; of the stress–energy tensor. However, it is often necessary to work with the covariant form,
:&lt;math&gt;T_{\mu \nu} = T^{\alpha \beta} g_{\alpha \mu} g_{\beta \nu},&lt;/math&gt;

or the mixed form,
:&lt;math&gt;T^\mu{}_\nu = T^{\mu \alpha} g_{\alpha \nu},&lt;/math&gt;

or as a mixed [[tensor density]]
:&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{T}^\mu{}_\nu = T^\mu{}_\nu \sqrt{-g} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

In this article we use the spacelike [[Sign convention#Metric signature|sign convention]] (−+++) for the metric signature.

==Conservation law==

===In special relativity===

{{see also|Relativistic angular momentum}}

The stress–energy tensor is the conserved [[Noether's theorem|Noether current]] associated with [[spacetime]] [[translation (physics)|translation]]s.

The divergence of the non-gravitational stress–energy is zero. In other words, non-gravitational energy and momentum are conserved,
:&lt;math&gt;0 = T^{\mu \nu}{}_{;\nu} = \nabla_\nu T^{\mu \nu}{}. \!&lt;/math&gt;
When gravity is negligible and using a [[Cartesian coordinate system]] for spacetime, this may be expressed in terms of partial derivatives as 
:&lt;math&gt;0 = T^{\mu \nu}{}_{,\nu} = \partial_{\nu} T^{\mu \nu}. \!&lt;/math&gt;

The integral form of this is
:&lt;math&gt;0 = \int_{\partial N} T^{\mu \nu} \mathrm{d}^3 s_{\nu} \!&lt;/math&gt;

where ''N'' is any compact four-dimensional region of spacetime; &lt;math&gt;\partial N&lt;/math&gt; is its boundary, a three-dimensional hypersurface; and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}^3 s_{\nu}&lt;/math&gt; is an element of the boundary regarded as the outward pointing normal.

In flat spacetime and using Cartesian coordinates, if one combines this with the symmetry of the stress–energy tensor, one can show that [[angular momentum]] is also conserved:
:&lt;math&gt;0 = (x^{\alpha} T^{\mu \nu} - x^{\mu} T^{\alpha \nu})_{,\nu} . \!&lt;/math&gt;

===In general relativity===
When gravity is non-negligible or when using arbitrary coordinate systems, the divergence of the stress–energy still vanishes. But in this case,  a [[Divergence#Generalizations|coordinate free definition of the divergence]] is used which incorporates the [[covariant derivative]]
:&lt;math&gt;0 = \operatorname{div} T = T^{\mu \nu}{}_{;\nu} = \nabla_{\nu} T^{\mu \nu} = T^{\mu \nu}{}_{,\nu} +  \Gamma^{\mu}{}_{\sigma \nu}T^{\sigma \nu} + \Gamma^{\nu}{}_{\sigma \nu} T^{\mu \sigma}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Gamma^{\mu}{}_{\sigma \nu} &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Christoffel symbol]] which is the gravitational [[force field (physics)|force field]].

Consequently, if &lt;math&gt;\xi^{\mu}&lt;/math&gt; is any [[Killing vector field]], then the conservation law associated with the symmetry generated by the Killing vector field may be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;0 = \nabla_\nu (\xi^{\mu} T_{\mu}^{\nu}) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{-g}} \partial_\nu( \sqrt{-g} \ \xi^{\mu} T_{\mu}^{\nu}) &lt;/math&gt;

The integral form of this is
:&lt;math&gt;0 = \int_{\partial N} \sqrt{-g} \ \xi^{\mu} T_{\mu}^{\nu} \ \mathrm{d}^3 s_{\nu} = \int_{\partial N}  \xi^{\mu} \mathfrak{T}_{\mu}^{\nu} \ \mathrm{d}^3 s_{\nu}&lt;/math&gt;

==In general relativity==
In [[general relativity]], the [[symmetric]] stress–energy tensor acts as the source of spacetime [[Riemann curvature tensor|curvature]], and is the current density associated with [[gauge transformation]]s of gravity which are general curvilinear [[coordinate transformation]]s. (If there is [[Torsion tensor|torsion]], then the tensor is no longer symmetric. This corresponds to the case with a nonzero [[spin tensor]] in [[Einstein–Cartan theory|Einstein–Cartan gravity theory]].)

In general relativity, the [[partial derivatives]] used in special relativity are replaced by [[covariant derivative]]s. What this means is that the continuity equation no longer implies that the non-gravitational energy and momentum expressed by the tensor are absolutely conserved, i.e. the gravitational field can do work on matter and vice versa. In the classical limit of [[Newtonian gravity]], this has a simple interpretation: energy is being exchanged with gravitational [[potential energy]], which is not included in the tensor, and momentum is being transferred through the field to other bodies. In general relativity the [[Stress–energy–momentum pseudotensor#Landau–Lifshitz pseudotensor|Landau–Lifshitz pseudotensor]] is a unique way to define the ''gravitational'' field energy and momentum densities. Any such [[Stress–energy–momentum pseudotensor|stress–energy pseudotensor]] can be made to vanish locally by a coordinate transformation.

In curved spacetime, the spacelike [[integral]] now depends on the spacelike slice, in general. There is in fact no way to define a global energy–momentum vector in a general curved spacetime.

=== The Einstein field equations ===
{{Main|Einstein field equations}}

In general relativity, the stress tensor is studied in the context of the Einstein field equations which are often written as

:&lt;math&gt;R_{\mu \nu} - \tfrac{1}{2} R\,g_{\mu \nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu \nu} = {8 \pi G \over c^4} T_{\mu \nu},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;R_{\mu \nu}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Ricci tensor]], &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the Ricci scalar (the [[tensor contraction]] of the Ricci tensor), &lt;math&gt;g_{\mu \nu}\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]], {{mvar|Λ}} is the [[cosmological constant]] (negligible at the scale of a galaxy or smaller), and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the [[universal gravitational constant]].

==Stress–energy in special situations==

===Isolated particle===
In special relativity, the stress–energy of a non-interacting particle with mass ''m'' and trajectory &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_\text{p}(t) &lt;/math&gt; is:
:&lt;math&gt;T^{\alpha \beta}(\mathbf{x},t) = \frac{m \, v^{\alpha}(t) v^{\beta}(t)}{\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}\;\, \delta(\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_\text{p}(t)) = \frac{E}{c^2}\;
 v^{\alpha}(t) v^{\beta}(t)\;\, \delta(\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_\text{p}(t)) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;(v^{\alpha})_{\alpha=0,1,2,3} \!&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity vector (which should not be confused with [[four-velocity]], since it is missing a &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;)
:&lt;math&gt; (v^{\alpha})_{\alpha=0,1,2,3} = \left(1, \frac{d \mathbf{x}_\text{p}}{dt}(t) \right) \,,&lt;/math&gt;
δ is the [[Dirac delta function]] and &lt;math&gt; E = \sqrt{p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4} &lt;/math&gt; is the [[energy]] of the particle.

===Stress–energy of a fluid in equilibrium===
For a [[perfect fluid]] in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]], the stress–energy tensor takes on a particularly simple form
:&lt;math&gt;T^{\alpha \beta} \, = \left(\rho + {p \over c^2}\right)u^{\alpha}u^{\beta} + p g^{\alpha \beta}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the mass–energy density (kilograms per cubic meter), &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the hydrostatic pressure ([[pascal (unit)|pascals]]), &lt;math&gt;u^{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; is the fluid's [[four velocity]], and &lt;math&gt;g^{\alpha \beta}&lt;/math&gt; is the reciprocal of the [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]]. Therefore, the trace is given by
:&lt;math&gt;T  = 3p - \rho c^2 \,.&lt;/math&gt;

The four velocity satisfies
:&lt;math&gt;u^{\alpha} u^{\beta} g_{\alpha \beta} = - c^2 \,.&lt;/math&gt;

In an [[inertial frame of reference]] comoving with the fluid, better known as the fluid's [[proper frame]] of reference, the four velocity is 
:&lt;math&gt;(u^{\alpha})_{\alpha=0,1,2,3} = (1, 0, 0, 0) \,,&lt;/math&gt;

the reciprocal of the metric tensor is simply
:&lt;math&gt;
(g^{\alpha \beta})_{\alpha,\beta=0,1,2,3} \, = \left( \begin{matrix}
                   - c^{-2} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
                   0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
                   0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
                   0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1    
      \end{matrix} \right)
\, &lt;/math&gt;

and the stress–energy tensor is a diagonal matrix
:&lt;math&gt;
(T^{\alpha \beta})_{\alpha,\beta=0,1,2,3} = \left( \begin{matrix}
                   \rho &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
                   0 &amp; p &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
                   0 &amp; 0 &amp; p &amp; 0 \\
                   0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; p    
      \end{matrix} \right).
&lt;/math&gt;

===Electromagnetic stress–energy tensor===
{{Main|Electromagnetic stress–energy tensor}}
The Hilbert stress–energy tensor of a source-free electromagnetic field is
:&lt;math&gt; T^{\mu \nu} = \frac{1}{\mu_0} \left( F^{\mu \alpha} g_{\alpha \beta} F^{\nu \beta} - \frac{1}{4} g^{\mu \nu} F_{\delta \gamma} F^{\delta \gamma} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; F_{\mu \nu} &lt;/math&gt; is the [[electromagnetic field tensor]].

===Scalar field===
{{Main|Klein–Gordon equation}}
The stress–energy tensor for a complex scalar field &lt;math&gt;\phi &lt;/math&gt; which satisfies the Klein–Gordon equation is
:&lt;math&gt;T^{\mu\nu} = \frac{\hbar^2}{m} (g^{\mu \alpha} g^{\nu \beta} + g^{\mu \beta} g^{\nu \alpha} - g^{\mu\nu} g^{\alpha \beta}) \partial_{\alpha}\bar\phi \partial_{\beta}\phi - g^{\mu\nu} m c^2 \bar\phi \phi ,&lt;/math&gt;
and when the metric is flat (Minkowski) its components work out to be:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} T^{00} &amp; =  \frac{\hbar^2}{m c^4} \left(\partial_0 \bar{\phi} \partial_0 \phi + c^2 \partial_k \bar{\phi} \partial_k \phi \right) + m \bar{\phi} \phi, \\
T^{0i} = T^{i0} &amp; = - \frac{\hbar^2}{m c^2} \left(\partial_0 \bar{\phi} \partial_i \phi + \partial_i \bar{\phi} \partial_0 \phi \right),\ \mathrm{and} \\
T^{ij} &amp; = \frac{\hbar^2}{m} \left(\partial_i \bar{\phi} \partial_j \phi + \partial_j \bar{\phi} \partial_i \phi \right) - \delta_{ij} \left(\frac{\hbar^2}{m} \eta^{\alpha\beta} \partial_\alpha \bar{\phi} \partial_\beta \phi + m c^2 \bar{\phi} \phi\right). 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==Variant definitions of stress–energy==
There are a number of inequivalent definitions of non-gravitational stress–energy:

===Hilbert stress–energy tensor===
The Hilbert stress–energy tensor is defined as the [[functional derivative]]
:&lt;math&gt;T_{\mu\nu} = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{-g}}\frac{\delta (\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{matter}} \sqrt{-g}) }{\delta g^{\mu\nu}} = - 2 \frac{\delta \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{matter}}{\delta g^{\mu\nu}} + g_{\mu\nu} \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{matter} ,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{matter}}&lt;/math&gt; is the nongravitational part of the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] density of the [[action (physics)|action]]. This is symmetric and gauge-invariant. See [[Einstein–Hilbert action]] for more information.

===Canonical stress–energy tensor===
[[Noether's theorem]] implies that there is a conserved current associated with translations through space and time. This is called the canonical stress–energy tensor. Generally, this is not symmetric and if we have some gauge theory, it may not be [[gauge invariant]] because space-dependent [[gauge transformation]]s do not commute with spatial translations.

In [[general relativity]], the translations are with respect to the coordinate system and as such, do not transform covariantly. See the section below on the gravitational stress–energy pseudo-tensor.

===Belinfante–Rosenfeld stress–energy tensor===
{{main|Belinfante–Rosenfeld stress–energy tensor}}
In the presence of spin or other intrinsic angular momentum, the canonical Noether stress energy tensor fails to be symmetric. The Belinfante–Rosenfeld stress energy tensor is constructed from the canonical stress–energy tensor and the spin current in such a way as to be symmetric and still conserved. In general relativity, this modified tensor agrees with the Hilbert stress–energy tensor.

==Gravitational stress–energy==
{{Main|Stress–energy–momentum pseudotensor}}
By the [[equivalence principle]] gravitational stress–energy will always vanish locally at any chosen point in some chosen frame, therefore gravitational stress–energy cannot be expressed as a non-zero tensor; instead we have to use a [[pseudotensor]].

In general relativity, there are many possible distinct definitions of the gravitational stress–energy–momentum pseudotensor. These include the Einstein pseudotensor and the [[Landau–Lifshitz pseudotensor]]. The Landau–Lifshitz pseudotensor can be reduced to zero at any event in spacetime by choosing an appropriate coordinate system.

{{Functions}}
In [[mathematics]], a [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f'' from a [[set (mathematics)|set]] ''X'' to a set ''Y'' is '''surjective''' (or '''onto'''), or a '''surjection''', if for every [[Element (mathematics)|element]] ''y'' in the [[codomain]] ''Y'' of ''f'' there is at least one element ''x'' in the [[domain of a function|domain]] ''X'' of ''f'' such that ''f''(''x'') = ''y''. It is not required that ''x'' be [[unique (mathematics)|unique]]; the function ''f'' may map one or more elements of ''X'' to the same element of ''Y''.

[[File:Surjection.svg|thumb|center|A surjective function from [[domain of a function|domain]] ''X'' to [[codomain]] ''Y''. The function is surjective because every point in the codomain is the value of ''f''(''x'') for at least one point ''x'' in the domain.]]

The term ''surjective'' and the related terms ''[[injective function|injective]]'' and ''[[bijective function|bijective]]'' were introduced by [[Nicolas Bourbaki]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://jeff560.tripod.com/i.html | title = Earliest Uses of Some of the Words of Mathematics | contribution = Injection, Surjection and Bijection | publisher = Tripod |first=Jeff|last=Miller}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a group of mainly [[France|French]] 20th-century [[mathematician]]s who under this pseudonym wrote a series of books presenting an exposition of modern advanced mathematics, beginning in 1935. The French word ''[[wikt:sur#French|sur]]'' means ''over'' or ''above'' and relates to the fact that the [[image (mathematics)|image]] of the domain of a surjective function completely covers the function's codomain.

Any function induces a surjection by [[restriction of a function|restricting]] its codomain to its [[range of a function|range]]. Every surjective function has a [[Inverse function#Left and right inverses|right inverse]], and every function with a right inverse is necessarily a surjection. The [[function composition|composite]] of surjective functions is always surjective. Any function can be decomposed into a surjection and an injection.

==Definition==
{{details|topic=notation|Function (mathematics)#Notation}}
A '''surjective function''' is a [[function(mathematics)|function]] whose [[image (mathematics)|image]] is equal to its [[codomain]].  Equivalently, a function ''f'' with [[domain of a function|domain]] ''X'' and codomain ''Y'' is surjective if for every ''y'' in ''Y'' there exists at least one ''x'' in ''X'' with &lt;math&gt;f(x)=y&lt;/math&gt;. Surjections are sometimes denoted by a two-headed rightwards arrow ({{unichar|21A0|RIGHTWARDS TWO HEADED ARROW|ulink=Unicode}}),&lt;ref name="Unicode Arrows"&gt;{{cite web| title = Arrows – Unicode| url = https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2190.pdf| accessdate = 2013-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; as in ''f'' : ''X'' ↠ ''Y''.

Symbolically,

:If &lt;math&gt;f\colon X \rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is said to be surjective if

:&lt;math&gt;\forall y \in Y, \, \exists x \in X, \;\; f(x)=y&lt;/math&gt;.

==Examples==
[[File:Codomain2.SVG|right|thumb|250px|'''A non-surjective function''' from [[domain of a function|domain]] ''X'' to [[codomain]] ''Y''. The smaller oval inside ''Y'' is the [[Image (mathematics)|image]] (also called [[range (mathematics)|range]]) of ''f''. This function is '''not''' surjective, because the image does not fill the whole codomain. In other words, ''Y'' is colored in a two-step process: First, for every ''x'' in ''X'', the point ''f''(''x'') is colored yellow; Second, all the rest of the points in ''Y'', that are not yellow, are colored blue. The function ''f'' is surjective only if there are no blue points.]]
For any set ''X'', the [[identity function]] id&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; on ''X'' is surjective.

The function {{Nowrap|''f'' : '''Z''' → '''{0,1}'''}} defined by ''f''(''n'') = ''n'' '''[[Modular arithmetic|mod]]''' 2 (that is, [[even number|even]] [[integer]]s are mapped to 0 and [[odd number|odd]] integers to 1) is surjective.

The function {{Nowrap|''f'' : '''R''' → '''R'''}} defined by ''f''(''x'') = 2''x'' + 1 is surjective (and even [[bijective function|bijective]]), because for every [[real number]] ''y'' we have an ''x'' such that ''f''(''x'') = ''y'': an appropriate ''x'' is (''y'' − 1)/2.

The function {{Nowrap|''f'' : '''R''' → '''R'''}} defined by ''f''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; − 3''x'' is surjective, because the pre-image of any [[real number]] ''y'' is the solution set of the cubic polynomial equation ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; − 3''x'' − ''y'' = 0 and every cubic polynomial with real coefficients has at least one real root. However, this function is not [[injective function|injective]] (and hence not [[bijective function|bijective]]) since e.g. the pre-image of ''y'' = 2 is {''x'' = −1, ''x'' = 2}. (In fact, the pre-image of this function for every ''y'',  −2 ≤ ''y'' ≤ 2 has more than one element.)

The function {{Nowrap|''g'' : '''R''' → '''R'''}} defined by {{Nowrap begin}}''g''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;{{Nowrap end}} is ''not'' surjective, because there is no real number ''x'' such that {{Nowrap begin}}''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = −1{{Nowrap end}}. However, the function {{Nowrap|''g'' : '''R''' → '''R{{sub|0}}{{sup|+}}'''}} defined by {{Nowrap begin}}''g''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;{{Nowrap end}} (with restricted codomain) ''is'' surjective because for every ''y'' in the nonnegative real codomain ''Y'' there is at least one ''x'' in the real domain ''X'' such that {{Nowrap begin}}''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''y''{{Nowrap end}}.

The [[natural logarithm]] function {{Nowrap|ln : &lt;nowiki&gt;(0,+∞)&lt;/nowiki&gt; → '''R'''}} is a surjective and even bijective mapping from the set of positive real numbers to the set of all real numbers. Its inverse, the [[exponential function]], is not surjective as its range is the set of positive real numbers, and its domain is usually defined to be the set of all real numbers. The [[matrix exponential]] is not surjective when seen as a map from the space of all ''n''×''n'' [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] to itself. It is, however, usually defined as a map from the space of all ''n''×''n'' matrices to the [[general linear group]] of degree ''n'', i.e. the [[group (mathematics)|group]] of all ''n''×''n'' [[invertible matrix|invertible matrices]]. Under this definition the matrix exponential is surjective for complex matrices, although still not surjective for real matrices.

The [[projection (set theory)|projection]] from a [[cartesian product]] {{Nowrap|''A'' × ''B''}} to one of its factors is surjective unless the other factor is empty.

In a 3D video game, vectors are projected onto a 2D flat screen by means of a surjective function.

[[File:Surjective function.svg|500px|thumb|left|Interpretation for '''surjective functions''' in the Cartesian plane, defined by the mapping ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'', where ''y'' = ''f''(''x''), ''X'' = domain of function, ''Y'' = range of function. Every element in the range is mapped onto from an element in the domain, by the rule ''f''. There may be a number of domain elements which map to the same range element. That is, every ''y'' in ''Y'' is mapped from an element ''x'' in ''X'', more than one ''x'' can map to the same ''y''. '''Left:''' Only one domain is shown which makes ''f'' surjective. '''Right:''' two possible domains ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are shown.]]

[[File:Non-surjective function2.svg|500px|thumb|right|'''Non-surjective functions''' in the Cartesian plane. Although some parts of the function are surjective, where elements ''y'' in ''Y'' do have a value ''x'' in ''X'' such that ''y'' = ''f''(''x''), some parts are not.

'''Right:''' There are ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''y''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in ''Y'', but there are no ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in ''X'' such that ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and ''y''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).]]

==Properties==
A function is [[bijective function|bijective]] if and only if it is both surjective and [[injective function|injective]].

If (as is often done) a function is identified with its [[graph of a function|graph]], then surjectivity is not a property of the function itself, but rather a property of the [[Map (mathematics)|mapping]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=T. M. Apostol|title=Mathematical Analysis|year=1981|publisher=Addison-Wesley|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This is, the function together with its codomain. Unlike injectivity, surjectivity cannot be read off of the graph of the function alone.

===Surjections as right invertible functions===
The function {{Nowrap|''g'' : ''Y'' → ''X''}} is said to be a [[Inverse function#Left and right inverses|right inverse]] of the function {{Nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} if {{Nowrap begin}}''f''(''g''(''y'')) = ''y''{{Nowrap end}} for every ''y'' in ''Y'' (''g'' can be undone by ''f'').  In other words, ''g'' is a right inverse of ''f'' if the [[function composition|composition]] {{Nowrap|''f'' &lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt; ''g''}} of ''g'' and ''f'' in that order is the [[identity function]] on the domain ''Y'' of ''g''. The function ''g'' need not be a complete [[inverse function|inverse]] of ''f'' because the composition in the other order, {{Nowrap|''g'' &lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt; ''f''}}, may not be the identity function on the domain ''X'' of ''f''. In other words, ''f'' can undo or "''reverse''" ''g'', but cannot necessarily be reversed by it.

Every function with a right inverse is necessarily a surjection. The proposition that every surjective function has a right inverse is equivalent to the [[axiom of choice]].

If {{Nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} is surjective and ''B'' is a [[subset]] of ''Y'', then {{Nowrap begin}}''f''(''f''&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt;(''B'')) = ''B''{{Nowrap end}}. Thus, ''B'' can be recovered from its [[preimage]] {{Nowrap|''f''&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt;(''B'')}}.

For example, in the first illustration, above, there is some function ''g'' such that ''g''(''C'') = 4.  There is also some function ''f'' such that ''f''(4) = ''C''.  It doesn't matter that ''g''(''C'') can also equal 3; it only matters that ''f'' "reverses" ''g''.

A function {{Nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} is surjective if and only if it is [[right-cancellative]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

This property is formulated in terms of functions and their [[function composition|composition]] and can be generalized to the more general notion of the [[morphism]]s of a [[category (mathematics)|category]] and their composition. Right-cancellative morphisms are called [[epimorphism]]s. Specifically, surjective functions are precisely the epimorphisms in the [[category of sets]]. The prefix ''epi'' is derived from the Greek preposition ''ἐπί'' meaning ''over'', ''above'', ''on''.

Any morphism with a right inverse is an epimorphism, but the converse is not true in general. A right inverse ''g'' of a morphism ''f'' is called a [[section (category theory)|section]] of ''f''. A morphism with a right inverse is called a [[split epimorphism]].

===Surjections as binary relations===
Any function with domain ''X'' and codomain ''Y'' can be seen as a [[left-total relation|left-total]] and [[right-unique relation|right-unique]] binary relation between ''X'' and ''Y'' by identifying it with its [[function graph]]. A surjective function with domain ''X'' and codomain ''Y'' is then a binary relation between ''X'' and ''Y'' that is right-unique and both left-total and [[right-total relation|right-total]].

===Cardinality of the domain of a surjection===
The [[cardinality]] of the domain of a surjective function is greater than or equal to the cardinality of its codomain: If {{Nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} is a surjective function, then ''X'' has at least as many elements as ''Y'', in the sense of [[cardinal number]]s.   (The proof appeals to the [[axiom of choice]] to show that a function
{{Nowrap|''g'' : ''Y'' → ''X''}} satisfying ''f''(''g''(''y'')) = ''y'' for all ''y'' in ''Y'' exists. ''g'' is easily seen to be injective, thus the [[Cardinal number#Formal definition|formal definition]] of |''Y''| ≤ |''X''| is satisfied.)

Specifically, if both ''X'' and ''Y'' are [[finite set|finite]] with the same number of elements, then {{Nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} is surjective if and only if ''f'' is [[injective]].

Given two sets ''X'' and ''Y'', the notation {{nowrap|''X'' ≤&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; ''Y''}} is used to say that either ''X'' is empty or that there is a surjection from ''Y'' onto ''X''. Using the axiom of choice one can show that {{nowrap|''X'' ≤&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; ''Y''}} and {{nowrap|''Y'' ≤&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; ''X''}} together imply that {{nowrap begin}}|''Y''| = |''X''|,{{nowrap end}} a variant of the [[Schröder–Bernstein theorem]].

===Composition and decomposition===
The [[function composition|composite]] of surjective functions is always surjective: If ''f'' and ''g'' are both surjective, and the codomain of ''g'' is equal to the domain of ''f'', then {{Nowrap|''f'' &lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt; ''g''}} is surjective. Conversely, if {{Nowrap|''f'' &lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt; ''g''}} is surjective, then ''f'' is surjective (but ''g'', the function applied first, need not be). These properties generalize from surjections in the [[category of sets]] to any [[epimorphism]]s in any [[category (mathematics)|category]].

Any function can be decomposed into a surjection and an [[injective function|injection]]: For any function {{Nowrap|''h'' : ''X'' → ''Z''}} there exist a surjection {{Nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} and an injection {{Nowrap|''g'' : ''Y'' → ''Z''}} such that {{Nowrap begin}}''h'' = ''g'' &lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt; ''f''{{Nowrap end}}. To see this, define ''Y'' to be the set of [[preimage]]s {{Nowrap|''h''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''z'')}} where ''z'' is in {{Nowrap|''h''(''X'')}}. These preimages are [[disjoint sets|disjoint]] and [[partition of a set|partition]] ''X''. Then ''f'' carries each ''x'' to the element of ''Y'' which contains it, and ''g'' carries each element of ''Y'' to the point in ''Z'' to which ''h'' sends its points. Then ''f'' is surjective since it is a projection map, and ''g'' is injective by definition.

===Induced surjection and induced bijection===
Any function induces a surjection by restricting its codomain to its range. Any surjective function induces a bijection defined on a [[quotient set|quotient]] of its domain by collapsing all arguments mapping to a given fixed image. More precisely, every surjection {{Nowrap|''f'' : ''A'' → ''B''}} can be factored as a projection followed by a bijection as follows. Let ''A''/~ be the [[equivalence class]]es of ''A'' under the following [[equivalence relation]]: ''x'' ~ ''y'' if and only if ''f''(''x'') = ''f''(''y''). Equivalently, ''A''/~ is the set of all preimages under ''f''. Let ''P''(~) : ''A'' → ''A''/~ be the [[projection map]] which sends each ''x'' in ''A'' to its equivalence class [''x'']&lt;sub&gt;~&lt;/sub&gt;, and let ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''P''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''A''/~ → ''B'' be the well-defined function given by ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''P''&lt;/sub&gt;([''x'']&lt;sub&gt;~&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''f''(''x''). Then ''f'' = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''P''&lt;/sub&gt; o ''P''(~).

[[File:Blank stop sign octagon.svg|thumb|upright|A red [[octagon]] symbolizes "stop" even without the word.|alt=Silhouette of a red octagon]]

A '''symbol''' is a mark, sign  or word that indicates, signifies, or is understood as representing an idea, object, or relationship. Symbols allow people to go beyond what is [[know]]n or seen by creating linkages between otherwise very different concepts and experiences. All communication (and data processing) is achieved through the use of symbols. Symbols take the form of words, sounds, gestures, ideas or visual images and are used to convey other ideas and beliefs. For example, a red octagon may be a symbol for "STOP". On a map, a blue line might represent a river. [[Numeral system|Numerals]] are symbols for [[number]]s. [[Alphabet]]ic letters may be symbols for sounds. Personal names are symbols representing individuals. A red rose may symbolize love and compassion. The [[variable (mathematics)|variable]] 'x', in a mathematical equation, may symbolize the position of a particle in space.

In [[cartography]], an organized collection of symbols forms a [[Legend (map)#Map symbology|legend]] for a map.

==Etymology==
The word ''symbol'' derives from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] σύμβολον ''symbolon'', meaning "token,  watchword" from σύν ''syn'' "together" and βάλλω ''bállō'' " "I throw, put." The sense evolution in Greek is from "throwing things together" to "contrasting" to "comparing" to "token used in comparisons to determine if something is genuine." Hence, "outward sign" of something. The meaning "something which stands for something else" was first recorded in 1590, in [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[Faerie Queene]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=symbol&amp;searchmode=none Online Etymological Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
In considering the effect of a symbol on the psyche, in his seminal essay ''The Symbol without Meaning'' [[Joseph Campbell]] proposes the following definition:
''A symbol is an energy evoking, and directing, agent''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Joseph|title=Flight of the Wild Gander:- The Symbol without Meaning|year=2002|publisher=New World Library|location=California|isbn=1-57731-210-4|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, expanding on what he means by this definition Campbell says:

:"a symbol, like everything else, shows a double aspect. We must distinguish, therefore between the 'sense' and the 'meaning' of the symbol. It seems to me perfectly clear that all the great and little symbolical systems of the past functioned simultaneously on three levels: the corporeal of waking consciousness, the spiritual of dream, and the ineffable of the absolutely unknowable. The term 'meaning' can refer only to the first two but these, today, are in the charge of science – which is the province as we have said, not of symbols but of signs. The ineffable, the absolutely unknowable, can be only sensed. It is the province of art which is not 'expression' merely, or even primarily, but a quest for, and formulation of, experience evoking, energy-waking images: yielding what [[Sir Herbert Read]] has aptly termed a 'sensuous apprehension of being'.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, ''The Symbol without Meaning p153''&lt;/ref&gt;
Jared Elisha defined symbolism that is something that stands for another, it can be place, object, or a person

[[Heinrich Zimmer]] gives a concise overview of the nature, and perennial relevance, of symbols.

:"Concepts and words are symbols, just as visions, rituals, and images are; so too are the manners and customs of daily life. Through all of these a transcendent reality is mirrored. There are so many metaphors reflecting and implying something which, though thus variously expressed, is ineffable, though thus rendered multiform, remains inscrutable. Symbols hold the mind to truth but are not themselves the truth, hence it is delusory to borrow them. Each civilisation, every age, must bring forth its own."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Heinrich Zimmer; edited by Joseph|title=Philosophies of India|year=1969|publisher=Princeton Univ. Press|location=Princeton|isbn=0-691-01758-1|pages=1–2|edition=9. paperback print.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book ''Signs and Symbols, ''it is stated that ''A symbol ... is a visual image or sign representing an idea -- a deeper indicator of a universal truth.''&lt;ref&gt;Dorling Kindersley Limited. Signs and Symbols. p.6. {{ISBN|978-0-7566-3393-6}}. 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Symbols are a means of complex communication that often can have multiple levels of meaning.&lt;ref name= "Womack"&gt;Womack, Mari. Symbols and Meaning: A Concise Introduction. California: AltaMira Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; This separates symbols from [[sign]]s, as signs have only one meaning.

Human cultures use symbols to express specific ideologies and social structures and to represent aspects of their specific culture.  Thus, symbols carry meanings that depend upon one’s cultural background; in other words, the meaning of a symbol is not inherent in the symbol itself but is culturally learned.&lt;ref name="Womack" /&gt;

Symbols are the basis of all human understanding and serve as vehicles of conception for all human knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Langer, Susanne K.  A Theory of Art, Developed From: Philosophy in a New Key. New York: Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt; Symbols facilitate understanding of the world in which we live, thus serving as the grounds upon which we make judgments.&lt;ref name="Catherine"&gt;Palczewski, Catherine, and Ice, Richard, and Fritch, John. Rhetoric in Civic Life. Pennsylvania: Strata Publishing, Inc., 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, people use symbols not only to make sense of the world around them, but also to [[Identification (psychology)|identify]] and cooperate in society through [[constitutive rhetoric]].

==Symbols and semiotics==

[[Semiotics]] is the study of signs, symbols, and signification as communicative behavior. Semiotics studies focus on the relationship of the signifier and the signified, also taking into account interpretation of visual cues, body language, sound, and other contextual clues.  Semiotics is linked with both [[linguistics]] and psychology.  Semioticians thus not only study what a symbol implies, but also how it got its meaning and how it functions to make meaning in society.  Symbols allow the human brain continuously to create meaning using sensory input and decode symbols through both [[denotation]] and [[connotation]].

==Psychoanalysis, rhetoric and archetypes==
Swiss psychoanalyst [[Carl Jung]], who studied [[archetype]]s, proposed an alternative definition of symbol, distinguishing it from the term ''[[Sign (linguistics)|sign]]''. In Jung's view, a sign stands for something known, as a word stands for its referent. He contrasted this with ''symbol'', which he used to stand for something that is unknown and that cannot be made clear or precise.  An example of a symbol in this sense is [[Christ]] as a symbol of the [[archetype]] called ''[[Self in Jungian psychology|self]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Christ, A symbol of the self CW vol 9i Aion RKP 1958&lt;/ref&gt; For example, written languages are composed of a variety of different symbols that create words, p. . Through these written words humans communicate with each other. [[Kenneth Burke]] described ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' as a "[[Definition of man|symbol-using, symbol making, and symbol misusing animal]]" to suggest that a person creates symbols as well as misuses them. One example he uses to indicate what he means by the misuse of symbol is the story of a man who, when told that a particular food item was whale blubber, could barely keep from throwing it up. Later, his friend discovered it was actually just a dumpling. But the man's reaction was a direct consequence of the symbol of "blubber" representing something inedible in his mind. In addition, the symbol of "blubber" was created by the man through various kinds of [[learning]].

Burke goes on to describe symbols as also being derived from [[Sigmund Freud]]'s work on [[Condensation (psychology)|condensation]] and [[Displacement (psychology)|displacement]], further stating that symbols are not just relevant to the [[The Interpretation of Dreams|theory of dreams]] but also to "normal symbol systems". He says they'''{{clarify|date=December 2013}}'''&lt;!--What is "they"?--&gt; are related through "substitution", where one word, phrase, or symbol is substituted for another in order to change the meaning{{clarify|date=December 2013}}&lt;!--The meaning of what?--&gt;. In other words, if one person does not understand a certain word or phrase, another person may substitute a synonym or symbol in order to get the meaning across. However, upon learning the new way of interpreting a specific symbol, the person may change his or her already-formed ideas to incorporate the new information{{clarify|date=December 2013}}&lt;!--This is still not clear.  These last two sentences do not clearly support or explain the one before it--&gt;.

[[Jean Dalby Clift]] says that people not only add their own interpretations to symbols, they also create personal symbols that represent their own understanding of their lives: what she calls "core images" of the person.  She argues that symbolic work with these personal symbols or core images can be as useful as working with dream symbols in psychoanalysis or counseling.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Dalby Clift, ''Core Images of the Self: A Symbolic Approach to Healing and Wholeness''.  Crossroad, 1992. {{page needed|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William Indick suggests that the symbols that are commonly found in myth, legend, and fantasy fulfil psychological functions and hence are why archetypes such as "the hero," "the princess" and "the witch" have remained popular for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130629202403/http://www.mcfarlandpub.com/book-2.php?id=978-0-7864-6039-7 Indick, William. Ancient Symbology in Fantasy Literature: A Psychological Study. Jefferson: McFarland &amp;, 2012. Print.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paul Tillich==

[[Paul Tillich]] argued that, while signs are invented and forgotten, symbols are born and die.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Theology of Culture|last = Tillich|first = Paul|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 1964|isbn = 0195007115|location = |pages = 58}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are, therefore, dead and living symbols. A living symbol can reveal to an individual hidden levels of meaning and transcendent or religious realities.  For Tillich a symbol always "points beyond itself" to something that is unquantifiable and mysterious; symbols open up the "depth dimension of reality itself".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Theology of Culture|last = Tillich|first = Paul|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 1964|isbn = 0195007115|location = |pages = 59}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Symbols are complex, and their meanings can evolve as the individual or culture evolves. When a symbol loses its meaning and power for an individual or culture, it becomes a dead symbol.
When a symbol becomes identified with the deeper reality to which it refers, it becomes idolatrous as the "symbol is taken for reality." The symbol itself is substituted for the deeper meaning it intends to convey. The unique nature of a symbol is that it gives access to deeper layers of reality which are otherwise inaccessible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Theology of Culture|last = Tillich|first = Paul|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 1964|isbn = 0195007115|location = |pages = 54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of context in symbolism==
{{Original research|section|date=January 2010}}
A symbol's [[Meaning (non-linguistic)|meaning]] may be modified by various factors including popular usage, [[history]], and contextual [[intent (law)|intent]].

===Historical meaning===
The history of a symbol is one of many factors in determining a particular symbol's apparent meaning. Consequently, symbols with emotive power carry problems analogous to [[false etymologies]].

===Context===
The context of a symbol may change its meaning.  Similar five-pointed stars might signify a [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] officer or a member of the [[armed services]], depending upon the [[uniform]].

== Symbols in Cartography ==
[[File:Cartographic Symbols.jpg|thumb|The three categories of cartographic symbol shapes.]]
Symbols are used in cartography to communicate geographical information (generally as point, line, or area features).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Principles of map design |last=Tyner |first=Judith A. |date=2010|publisher=Guilford Press |isbn=9781606235447 |location=New York |oclc=437300476}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with other symbols, visual variables such as size, shape, orientation, texture, and pattern provide meaning to the symbol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Cartography : thematic map design |last=Dent |first=Borden D. |last2=Torguson |first2=Jeffrey |last3=Hodler |first3=T. W. |isbn=0072943823 |edition=6th |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education |oclc=184827987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The form, or shape, of a cartographic symbol is classified into one of three main groups:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=How maps work : representation, visualization, and design |last=MacEachren |first=Alan M. |date=1995 |publisher=Guilford Press |isbn=0898625890 |location=New York |oclc=31078855}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pictorial/Representational''' - a shape or image that clearly resembles the geographic feature being symbolized and can be interpreted without a legend.

'''Associative''' - a mixture of pictorial and geometric elements that produce an easily recognizable shape.

'''Abstract/Geometric''' - completely arbitrary shapes chosen to represent a certain feature.

==Symbolic action==
A '''symbolic action''' is an action that has no, or little, practical effect but symbolizes, or signals, what the actor wants or believes.  The action conveys meaning to the viewers.

Symbolic action may overlap with [[symbolic speech]], such as the use of [[flag burning]] to express hostility or saluting the flag to express patriotism.&lt;ref name="Bagossy2008"&gt;Bagossy, Renate. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=4LyziXxw238C&amp;pg=PA16 The Difficulty of the Amendment Process of the Constitution of the United States of America and Freedom of Speech and its limits]''. GRIN Verlag; 2008-08-11 [cited 5 November 2012]. {{ISBN|9783640129546}}. p. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to intense public criticism, businesses, organizations, and governments may take symbolic actions rather than, or in addition to, directly addressing the identified problems.&lt;ref name="Bednar2008"&gt;Bednar, Michael Kay. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=7Fyefq5LV8sC How Symbolic Action Affects the Media as a Governance Mechanism]''. ProQuest; 2008. {{ISBN|9780549738817}}. p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Symbolic actions are sometimes derided as [[slacktivism]].

In the branch of [[mathematics]] called [[homological algebra]], a '''''t''-structure''' is a way to axiomatize the properties of an [[abelian category|abelian subcategory]] of a [[derived category]].  A ''t''-structure on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; consists of two subcategories &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{D}^{\le 0}, \mathcal{D}^{\ge 0})&lt;/math&gt; of a [[triangulated category]] or stable [[infinity category]] which abstract the idea of complexes whose cohomology vanishes in positive, respectively negative, degrees.  There can be many distinct ''t''-structures on the same category, and the interplay between these structures has implications for algebra and geometry.  The notion of a ''t''-structure arose in the work of Beilinson, Bernstein, Deligne, and Gabber on [[perverse sheaf|perverse sheaves]].&lt;ref&gt;Beĭlinson, A. A.; Bernstein, J.; Deligne, P. ''Faisceaux pervers.'' Analysis and topology on singular spaces, I (Luminy, 1981),  5–171, Astérisque, 100, Soc. Math. France, Paris, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Fix a triangulated category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; with translation functor &lt;math&gt;[1]&lt;/math&gt;.  A '''''t''-structure''' on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; is a pair &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{D}^{\le 0}, \mathcal{D}^{\ge 0})&lt;/math&gt; of full subcategories, each of which is stable under isomorphism, which satisfy the following three axioms.
# If ''X'' is an object of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\le 0}&lt;/math&gt; and ''Y'' is an object of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\ge 0}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathcal{D}}(X, Y[-1]) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
# If ''X'' is an object of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\le 0}&lt;/math&gt;, then ''X''[1] is also an object of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\le 0}&lt;/math&gt;.  Similarly, if ''Y'' is an object of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\ge 0}&lt;/math&gt;, then ''Y''[-1] is also an object of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\ge 0}&lt;/math&gt;.
# If ''A'' is an object of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;, then there exists a distinguished triangle &lt;math&gt;X \to A \to Y[-1] \to X[1]&lt;/math&gt; such that ''X'' is an object of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\le 0}&lt;/math&gt; and ''Y'' is an object of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\ge 0}&lt;/math&gt;.
It can be shown that the subcategories &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\le 0}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\ge 0}&lt;/math&gt; are closed under extensions in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;.  In particular, they are stable under finite direct sums.

If &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; is a stable &amp;infin;-category, then a '''''t''-structure''' on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; is defined to be a ''t''-structure on its homotopy category &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{h}\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; (which is a triangulated category).

Suppose that &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{D}^{\le 0}, \mathcal{D}^{\ge 0})&lt;/math&gt; is a ''t''-structure on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; (either a triangulated category or a stable &amp;infin;-category).  In this case, for any integer ''n'', we define &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\le n}&lt;/math&gt; to be the full subcategory of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; whose objects have the form &lt;math&gt;X[-n]&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is an object of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\le 0}&lt;/math&gt;.  Similarly, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\ge n}&lt;/math&gt; is the full subcategory of objects &lt;math&gt;Y[-n]&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is an object of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\ge 0}&lt;/math&gt;.  More briefly, we define
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathcal{D}^{\le n} &amp;= \mathcal{D}^{\le 0}[-n], \\
\mathcal{D}^{\ge n} &amp;= \mathcal{D}^{\ge 0}[-n].
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
With this notation, the axioms above may be rewritten as:
# If ''X'' is an object of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\le 0}&lt;/math&gt; and ''Y'' is an object of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\ge 1}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathcal{D}}(X, Y) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\le 0} \subseteq \mathcal{D}^{\le 1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\ge 0} \supseteq \mathcal{D}^{\ge 1}&lt;/math&gt;.
# If ''A'' is an object of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;, then there exists a distinguished triangle &lt;math&gt;X \to A \to Y \to X[1]&lt;/math&gt; such that ''X'' is an object of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\le 0}&lt;/math&gt; and ''Y'' is an object of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\ge 1}&lt;/math&gt;.

The '''heart''' or '''core''' of the ''t''-structure is the full subcategory &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^\heartsuit&lt;/math&gt; consisting of objects in both &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\le 0}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\ge 0}&lt;/math&gt;, that is,
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^\heartsuit = \mathcal{D}^{\le 0} \cap \mathcal{D}^{\ge 0}.&lt;/math&gt;
The heart of a ''t''-structure is an [[abelian category]] (whereas a triangulated category is additive but almost never abelian), and it is stable under extensions.

A triangulated or stable &amp;infin;-category with a choice of ''t''-structure is sometimes called a '''''t''-category'''.

===Variations===
It is clear that, to define a ''t''-structure, it suffices to fix integers ''m'' and ''n'' and specify &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\le m}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\ge n}&lt;/math&gt;.  Some authors define a ''t''-structure to be the pair &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{D}^{\le 0}, \mathcal{D}^{\ge 1})&lt;/math&gt;.

The two subcategories &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\le 0}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\ge 1}&lt;/math&gt; determine each other.  An object ''X'' is in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\le 0}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Hom}(X, Y) = 0&lt;/math&gt; for all objects ''Y'' in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\ge 1}&lt;/math&gt;, and vice versa.  That is, &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{D}^{\le 0}, \mathcal{D}^{\ge 1})&lt;/math&gt; are left and right orthogonal complements of each other.  Consequently it is enough to specify only one of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\le 0}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\ge 1}&lt;/math&gt;.

The above notation is adapted to the study of cohomology.  When the goal is to study homology, slightly different notation is used.  A '''homological ''t''-structure''' on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; is a pair &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{D}_{\ge 0}, \mathcal{D}_{\le 0})&lt;/math&gt; such that, if we define
:&lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{D}^{\le 0}, \mathcal{D}^{\ge 0}) = (\mathcal{D}_{\ge 0}, \mathcal{D}_{\le 0}),&lt;/math&gt;
then &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{D}^{\le 0}, \mathcal{D}^{\ge 0})&lt;/math&gt; is a (cohomological) ''t''-structure on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;.  That is, the definition is the same except that upper indices are converted to lower indices and the roles of &lt;math&gt;\ge&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\le&lt;/math&gt; are swapped.  If we define
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathcal{D}_{\ge n} &amp;= \mathcal{D}_{\ge 0}[n], \\
\mathcal{D}_{\le n} &amp;= \mathcal{D}_{\le 0}[n],
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
then the axioms for a homological ''t''-structure may be written explicitly as
# If ''X'' is an object of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}_{\ge 0}&lt;/math&gt; and ''Y'' is an object of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}_{\le -1}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathcal{D}}(X, Y) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}_{\ge 1} \subseteq \mathcal{D}_{\ge 0}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}_{\le 1} \supseteq \mathcal{D}_{\le 0}&lt;/math&gt;.
# If ''A'' is an object of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;, then there exists a distinguished triangle &lt;math&gt;X \to A \to Y \to X[1]&lt;/math&gt; such that ''X'' is an object of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}_{\ge 0}&lt;/math&gt; and ''Y'' is an object of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}_{\le -1}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Examples==
===The natural ''t''-structure===
The most fundamental example of a ''t''-structure is the '''natural ''t''-structure''' on a derived category.  Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; be an abelian category, and let &lt;math&gt;D(\mathcal{A})&lt;/math&gt; be its derived category.  Then the natural ''t''-structure is defined by the pair of subcategories
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
D(\mathcal{A})^{\le 0} &amp;= \{X \colon \forall i &gt; 0,\ H^i(X) = 0\}, \\
D(\mathcal{A})^{\ge 0} &amp;= \{X \colon \forall i &lt; 0,\ H^i(X) = 0\}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
It follows immediately that
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
D(\mathcal{A})^{\le n} &amp;= \{X \colon \forall i &gt; n,\ H^i(X) = 0\}, \\
D(\mathcal{A})^{\ge n} &amp;= \{X \colon \forall i &lt; n,\ H^i(X) = 0\}, \\
D(\mathcal{A})^\heartsuit &amp;= \{X \colon \forall i \neq 0,\ H^i(X) = 0\} \cong \mathcal{A}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
In this case, the third axiom for a ''t''-structure, the existence of a certain distinguished triangle, can be made explicit as follows.  Suppose that &lt;math&gt;A^\bullet&lt;/math&gt; is a cochain complex with values in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;.  Define
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\tau^{\le 0}A^\bullet &amp;= (\cdots \to A^{-2} \to A^{-1} \to \ker d^0 \to 0 \to 0 \to \cdots), \\
\tau^{\ge 1}A^\bullet &amp;= (\cdots \to 0 \to 0 \to A^0 / \ker d^0 \to A^1 \to A^2 \to \cdots).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
It is clear that &lt;math&gt;\tau^{\ge 1}A^\bullet = A^\bullet / \tau^{\le 0}A^\bullet&lt;/math&gt; and that there is a short exact sequence of complexes
:&lt;math&gt;0 \to \tau^{\le 0} A^\bullet \to A^\bullet \to \tau^{\ge 1} A^\bullet \to 0.&lt;/math&gt;
This exact sequence furnishes the required distinguished triangle.

This example can be generalized to exact categories (in the sense of Quillen).&lt;ref&gt;Beilinson, Bernstein, and Deligne, 1.3.22.&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also similar ''t''-structures for the bounded, bounded above, and bounded below derived categories.  If &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; is an abelian subcategory of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;, then the full subcategory &lt;math&gt;D_{\mathcal{C}}(\mathcal{A})&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;D(\mathcal{A})&lt;/math&gt; consisting of those complexes whose cohomology is in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; has a similar ''t''-structure whose heart is &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Beilinson, Bernstein, and Deligne, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perverse sheaves===
The category of ''[[perverse sheaves]]'' is, by definition, the core of the so-called ''perverse t-structure'' on the derived category of the category of sheaves on a [[complex analytic space]] ''X'' or (working with l-adic sheaves) an [[algebraic variety]] over a finite field. As was explained above, the heart of the standard t-structure simply contains ordinary sheaves, regarded as complexes concentrated in degree 0. For example, the category of perverse sheaves on a (possibly singular) algebraic curve ''X'' (or analogously a possibly singular surface) is designed so that it contains, in particular, objects of the form
:&lt;math&gt;i_* F_Z, j_* F_U[1]&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;i: Z \to X&lt;/math&gt; is the inclusion of a point, &lt;math&gt;F_Z&lt;/math&gt; is an ordinary sheaf, &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is a smooth open subscheme and &lt;math&gt;F_U&lt;/math&gt; is a locally constant sheaf on ''U''. Note the presence of the shift according to the dimension of ''Z'' and ''U'' respectively. This shift causes the category of perverse sheaves to be [[well-behaved]] on singular spaces.  The simple objects in this category are the [[intersection cohomology]] sheaves of subvarieties with coefficients in an irreducible local system.
This t-structure was introduced by Beilinson, Bernstein and Deligne.&lt;ref&gt;Beĭlinson, A. A.; Bernstein, J.; Deligne, P. ''Faisceaux pervers.'' Analysis and topology on singular spaces, I (Luminy, 1981),  5–171, Astérisque, 100, Soc. Math. France, Paris, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; It was shown by Beilinson that the derived category of the heart &lt;math&gt;D^b(Perv(X))&lt;/math&gt; is in fact equivalent to the original derived category of sheaves. This is an example of the general fact that a triangulated category may be endowed with several distinct t-structures.&lt;ref&gt;Beĭlinson, A. A. ''On the derived category of perverse sheaves.'' K-theory, arithmetic and geometry (Moscow, 1984–1986),  27–41, Lecture Notes in Math., 1289, Springer, Berlin, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graded modules===
A non-standard example of a t-structure on the derived category of (graded) modules over a [[graded ring]] has the property that its heart consists of complexes
:&lt;math&gt;\dots \to P^n \to P^{n+1} \to \dots&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;P^n&lt;/math&gt; is a module generated by its (graded) degree ''n''. This t-structure called geometric t-structure plays a prominent role in [[Koszul duality]].&lt;ref&gt;Beilinson, Alexander; Ginzburg, Victor; Soergel, Wolfgang. ''Koszul duality patterns in representation theory.''  J. Amer. Math. Soc.  9  (1996),  no. 2, 473–527.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spectra===
The category of [[spectrum (topology)|spectra]] is endowed with a t-structure generated, in the sense above, by a single object, namely the [[sphere spectrum]]. The category &lt;math&gt;Sp^{\le 0}&lt;/math&gt; is the category of connective spectra, i.e., those whose negative [[homotopy group]]s vanish. (In areas related to homotopy theory, it is common to use homological conventions, as opposed to cohomological ones, so in this case it is common to replace "&lt;math&gt;\le&lt;/math&gt;" by "&lt;math&gt;\ge&lt;/math&gt;". Using this convention, the category of connective spectra the notation is denoted &lt;math&gt;Sp^{\ge 0}&lt;/math&gt;.)

===Motives===
A conjectural example in the theory of [[motive (algebraic geometry)|motives]] is the so-called ''motivic t-structure''. Its (conjectural) existence is closely related to certain [[standard conjectures on algebraic cycles]] and vanishing conjectures, such as the [[Beilinson-Soulé conjecture]].&lt;ref&gt;Hanamura, Masaki. ''Mixed motives and algebraic cycles. III.''  Math. Res. Lett.  6  (1999),  no. 1, 61–82.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Truncation functors==
In the above example of the natural ''t''-structure on an abelian category, the distinguished triangle guaranteed by the third axiom was constructed by truncation.  As operations on the category of complexes, the truncations &lt;math&gt;\tau_{\le 0}A^\bullet&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau_{\ge 1} A^\bullet&lt;/math&gt; are functorial, and the resulting short exact sequence of complexes is natural in &lt;math&gt;A^\bullet&lt;/math&gt;.  Using this, it can be shown that there are truncation functors on the derived category and that they induce a natural distinguished triangle.

In fact, this is an example of a general phenomenon.  While the axioms for a ''t''-structure do not assume the existence of truncation functors, such functors can always be constructed and are essentially unique.  Suppose that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; is a triangulated category and that &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{D}^{\le 0}, \mathcal{D}^{\ge 0})&lt;/math&gt; is a ''t''-structure.  The precise statement is that the inclusion functors
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\iota^{\le n} \colon &amp;\mathcal{D}^{\le n} \to \mathcal{D}, \\
\iota^{\ge n} \colon &amp;\mathcal{D}^{\ge n} \to \mathcal{D}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
admit [[adjoint functor|adjoints]].  These are functors
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\tau^{\le n} \colon &amp;\mathcal{D} \to \mathcal{D}^{\le n}, \\
\tau^{\ge n} \colon &amp;\mathcal{D} \to \mathcal{D}^{\ge n}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
such that
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\iota^{\le n} \dashv \tau^{\le n}, \\
\tau^{\ge n} \dashv \iota^{\ge n}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt; 
Moreover, for any object &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a unique
:&lt;math&gt;d \in \operatorname{Hom}^1(\tau^{\ge 1} A, \tau^{\le 0} A)&lt;/math&gt;
such that ''d'' and the counit and unit of the adjunctions together define a distinguished triangle
:&lt;math&gt;\tau^{\le 0} A \to A \to \tau^{\ge 1} A\ \stackrel{d}{\to}\ \tau^{\le 0} A[1].&lt;/math&gt;
Up to unique isomorphism, this is the unique distinguished triangle of the form &lt;math&gt;X \to A \to Y \to X[1]&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; objects of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\le 0}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\ge 1}&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.  It follows from the existence of this triangle that an object &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; lies in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\le n}&lt;/math&gt; (resp. &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\ge n}&lt;/math&gt;) if and only if &lt;math&gt;\tau^{\ge n+1}(A) = 0&lt;/math&gt; (resp. &lt;math&gt;\tau^{\le n-1}(A) = 0&lt;/math&gt;).

The existence of &lt;math&gt;\tau^{\le 0}&lt;/math&gt; implies the existence of the other truncation functors by shifting and taking opposite categories.  If &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is an object of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;, the third axiom for a ''t''-structure asserts the existence of an &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\le 0}&lt;/math&gt; and a morphism &lt;math&gt;X \to A&lt;/math&gt; fitting into a certain distinguished triangle.  For each &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, fix one such triangle and define &lt;math&gt;\tau^{\le 0}(A) = X&lt;/math&gt;.  The axioms for a ''t''-structure imply that, for any object &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\le 0}&lt;/math&gt;, we have
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Hom}(T, X) \cong \operatorname{Hom}(T, A),&lt;/math&gt;
with the isomorphism being induced by the morphism &lt;math&gt;X \to A&lt;/math&gt;.  This exhibits &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; as a solution to a certain universal mapping problem.  Standard results on adjoint functors now imply that &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is unique up to unique isomorphism and that there is a unique way to define &lt;math&gt;\tau^{\le 0}&lt;/math&gt; on morphisms that makes it a right adjoint.  This proves the existence of &lt;math&gt;\tau^{\le 0}&lt;/math&gt; and hence the existence of all the truncation functors.

Repeated truncation for a ''t''-structure behaves similarly to repeated truncation for complexes.  If &lt;math&gt;n \le m&lt;/math&gt;, then there are natural transformations
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\tau^{\le n} &amp;\to \tau^{\le m}, \\
\tau^{\ge n} &amp;\to \tau^{\ge m},
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
which yield natural equivalences
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\tau^{\le n}\ &amp;\stackrel{\sim}{\to}\ \tau^{\le n} \circ \tau^{\le m}, \\
\tau^{\ge m}\ &amp;\stackrel{\sim}{\to}\ \tau^{\ge m} \circ \tau^{\ge n}, \\
\tau^{\ge n} \circ \tau^{\le m} \ &amp;\stackrel{\sim}{\to}\ \tau^{\le m} \circ \tau^{\ge n}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==Cohomology functors==
The ''n''th ''cohomology functor'' &lt;math&gt;H^n&lt;/math&gt; is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;H^n = \tau^{\le 0} \circ  \tau^{\ge 0} \circ [n].&lt;/math&gt;
As the name suggests, this is a cohomological functor in the usual sense for a triangulated category.  That is, for any distinguished triangle &lt;math&gt;X \to Y \to Z \to X[1]&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain a [[long exact sequence]]
:&lt;math&gt;\cdots \to H^i(X) \to H^i(Y) \to H^i(Z) \to H^{i + 1}(X) \to \cdots.&lt;/math&gt;
In applications to algebraic topology, the cohomology functors may be denoted &lt;math&gt;\pi_n&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;H^n&lt;/math&gt;.  The cohomology functors take values in the heart &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^\heartsuit&lt;/math&gt;.

For the natural ''t''-structure on a derived category &lt;math&gt;D(\mathcal{A})&lt;/math&gt;, the cohomology functor &lt;math&gt;H^n&lt;/math&gt; is, up to quasi-isomorphism, the usual ''n''th cohomology group of a complex.  However, considered as functors on complexes, this is ''not'' true.  Consider, for example, &lt;math&gt;H^0&lt;/math&gt; as defined in terms of the natural ''t''-structure.  By definition, this is
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
H^0(A^\bullet)
&amp;= \tau^{\le 0}(\tau^{\ge 0}(A^\bullet)) \\
&amp;= \tau^{\le 0}(\cdots \to 0 \to A^{-1} / \ker d^{-1} \to A^0 \to A^1 \to \cdots) \\
&amp;= (\cdots \to 0 \to A^{-1} / \ker d^{-1} \to \ker d^0 \to 0 \to \cdots).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
This complex is non-zero in degrees &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, so it is clearly not the same as the zeroth cohomology group of the complex &lt;math&gt;A^\bullet&lt;/math&gt;.  However, the non-trivial differential is an injection, so the only non-trivial cohomology is in degree &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, where it is &lt;math&gt;\ker d^0 / \operatorname{im} d^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, the zeroth cohomology group of the complex &lt;math&gt;A^\bullet&lt;/math&gt;.  It follows that the two possible definitions of &lt;math&gt;H^0(A^\bullet)&lt;/math&gt; are quasi-isomorphic.

A ''t''-structure is '''non-degenerate''' if the intersection of all &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\le n}&lt;/math&gt;, as well as the intersection of all &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\ge n}&lt;/math&gt;, consists only of zero objects.  For a non-degenerate ''t''-structure, the collection of functors &lt;math&gt;\{H^n\}_{n \in \mathbf{Z}}&lt;/math&gt; is conservative.  Moreover, in this case, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\le n}&lt;/math&gt; (resp. &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\ge n}&lt;/math&gt;) may be identified with the full subcategory of those objects &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; for which &lt;math&gt;H^i(A) = 0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;i &gt; n&lt;/math&gt; (resp. &lt;math&gt;i &lt; n&lt;/math&gt;).

==Exact functors==
For &lt;math&gt;i = 1, 2&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}_i&lt;/math&gt; be a triangulated category with a fixed ''t''-structure &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{D}_i^{\le 0}, \mathcal{D}_i^{\ge 0})&lt;/math&gt;  Suppose that &lt;math&gt;F \colon \mathcal{D}_1 \to \mathcal{D}_2&lt;/math&gt; is an exact functor (in the usual sense for triangulated categories, that is, up to a natural equivalence it commutes with translation and preserves distinguished triangles).  Then &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is:
* '''Left ''t''-exact''' if &lt;math&gt;F(\mathcal{D}_1^{\ge 0}) \subseteq \mathcal{D}_2^{\ge 0}&lt;/math&gt;,
* '''Right ''t''-exact''' if &lt;math&gt;F(\mathcal{D}_1^{\le 0}) \subseteq \mathcal{D}_2^{\le 0}&lt;/math&gt;, and
* '''''t''-exact''' if it is both left and right ''t''-exact.

It is elementary to see that if &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is fully faithful and ''t''-exact, then an object &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}_1&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}_1^{\le 0}&lt;/math&gt; (resp. &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}_1^{\ge 0}&lt;/math&gt;) if and only if &lt;math&gt;FA&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}_2^{\le 0}&lt;/math&gt; (resp. &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}_2^{\ge 0}&lt;/math&gt;).  It is also elementary to see that if &lt;math&gt;G \colon \mathcal{D}_2 \to \mathcal{D}_3&lt;/math&gt; is another left (resp. right) ''t''-exact functor, then the composite &lt;math&gt;G \circ F&lt;/math&gt; is also left (resp. right) ''t''-exact.

The motivation for the study of one-sided ''t''-exactness properties is that they lead to one-sided exactness properties on hearts.  Let &lt;math&gt;\iota_i^\heartsuit \colon \mathcal{D}_i^\heartsuit \to \mathcal{D}_i&lt;/math&gt; be the inclusion.  Then there is a composite functor
:&lt;math&gt;{}^pF = H^0 \circ F \circ \iota_1^\heartsuit \colon \mathcal{D}_1^\heartsuit \to \mathcal{D}_2^\heartsuit.&lt;/math&gt;
It can be shown that if &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is left (resp. right) exact, then &lt;math&gt;{}^pF&lt;/math&gt; is also left (resp. right) exact, and that if &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is also left (resp. right) exact, then &lt;math&gt;{}^p(G \circ F) = ({}^pG) \circ F&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is left (resp. right) ''t''-exact, and if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\le 0}&lt;/math&gt; (resp. &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\ge 0}&lt;/math&gt;), then there is a natural isomorphism &lt;math&gt;{}^pF(H^0A)\ \stackrel{\sim}{\to}\ H^0F(A)&lt;/math&gt; (resp. &lt;math&gt;H^0F(A)\ \stackrel{\sim}{\to}\ {}^pF(H^0A)&lt;/math&gt;).

If &lt;math&gt;(T^*, T_*) \colon \mathcal{D}_1 \leftrightarrows \mathcal{D}_2&lt;/math&gt; are exact functors with &lt;math&gt;T^*&lt;/math&gt; left adjoint to &lt;math&gt;T_*&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;T^*&lt;/math&gt; is right ''t''-exact if and only if &lt;math&gt;T_*&lt;/math&gt; is left ''t''-exact, and in this case, &lt;math&gt;({}^pT^*, {}^pT_*)&lt;/math&gt; are a pair of adjoint functors &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}_1^\heartsuit \leftrightarrows \mathcal{D}_2^\heartsuit&lt;/math&gt;.

==Constructions of ''t''-structures==
Let &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{D}^{\le 0}, \mathcal{D}^{\ge 0})&lt;/math&gt; be a ''t''-structure on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;.  If ''n'' is an integer, then the '''translation by ''n''''' ''t''-structure is &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{D}^{\le n}, \mathcal{D}^{\ge n})&lt;/math&gt;.  The '''dual ''t''-structure''' is the ''t''-structure on the [[opposite category]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^\text{op}&lt;/math&gt; defined by &lt;math&gt;((\mathcal{D}^{\le 0})^\text{op}, (\mathcal{D}^{\ge 0})^\text{op})&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}'&lt;/math&gt; be a triangulated subcategory of a triangulated category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;.  If &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{D}^{\le 0}, \mathcal{D}^{\ge 0})&lt;/math&gt; is a ''t''-structure on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;, then
:&lt;math&gt;((\mathcal{D}')^{\le 0}, (\mathcal{D}')^{\ge 0}) = (\mathcal{D}' \cap \mathcal{D}^{\le 0}, \mathcal{D}' \cap \mathcal{D}^{\ge 0})&lt;/math&gt;
is a ''t''-structure on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}'&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}'&lt;/math&gt; is stable under the truncation functor &lt;math&gt;\tau^{\le 0}&lt;/math&gt;.  When this condition holds, the ''t''-structure &lt;math&gt;((\mathcal{D}')^{\le 0}, (\mathcal{D}')^{\ge 0})&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''induced ''t''-structure'''.  The truncation and cohomology functors for the induced ''t''-structure are the restriction to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}'&lt;/math&gt; of those on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;.  Consequently the inclusion of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}'&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; is ''t''-exact, and &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{D}')^\heartsuit = \mathcal{D}^\heartsuit \cap \mathcal{D}'&lt;/math&gt;.

To construct the category of perverse sheaves, it is important to be able to define a ''t''-structure on a category of sheaves over a space by working locally in that space.  The precise conditions necessary for this to be possible can be abstracted somewhat to the following setup.  Suppose that there are three triangulated categories and two morphisms
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}_F\ \stackrel{i_*}{\to}\ \mathcal{D}\ \stackrel{j^*}{\to}\ \mathcal{D}_U&lt;/math&gt;
satisfying the following properties.
* There are two sequences of triples of adjoint functors &lt;math&gt;(j_!, j^*, j_*)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(i^*, i_*, i^!)&lt;/math&gt;.
* The functors &lt;math&gt;i_*&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;j_!&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;j^*&lt;/math&gt; are full and faithful, and they satisfy &lt;math&gt;j^*i_* = 0&lt;/math&gt;.
* There are unique differentials making, for every ''K'' in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;, exact triangles
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
j_!j^*K &amp;\to K \to i_*i^*K \to j_!j^*K[1], \\
i_*i^!K &amp;\to K \to i_*i^*K \to i_*i^!K[1].
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
In this case, given ''t''-structures &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{D}_U^{\le 0}, \mathcal{D}_U^{\ge 0})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{D}_F^{\le 0}, \mathcal{D}_F^{\ge 0})&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}_U&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}_F&lt;/math&gt;, respectively, there is a ''t''-structure on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; defined by
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathcal{D}^{\le 0} &amp;= \{ K \in \mathcal{D} \colon j^*K \in \mathcal{D}_U^{\le 0},\ i^*K \in \mathcal{D}_F^{\le 0}\}, \\
\mathcal{D}^{\ge 0} &amp;= \{ K \in \mathcal{D} \colon j^*K \in \mathcal{D}_U^{\ge 0},\ i^*K \in \mathcal{D}_F^{\ge 0}\}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
This ''t''-structure is said to be the '''gluing''' of the ''t''-structures on ''U'' and ''F''.  The intended use cases are when &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}_U&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}_F&lt;/math&gt; are bounded below derived categories of sheaves on a space ''X'', an open subset ''U'', and the closed complement ''F'' of ''U''.  The functors &lt;math&gt;j^*&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;i_*&lt;/math&gt; are the usual pullback and pushforward functors.  This works, in particular, when the sheaves in question are left modules over a sheaf of rings &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}&lt;/math&gt; on ''X'' and when the sheaves are ℓ-adic sheaves.

Many t-structures arise by means of the following fact: in a triangulated category with arbitrary [[direct sum]]s, and a set &lt;math&gt;S_0&lt;/math&gt; of [[compact object (category theory)|compact objects]] in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;, the subcategories
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathcal{D}^{\ge 1} &amp;= \{X \in \mathcal{D} \colon \operatorname{Hom}(S_0[-n], X) = 0, n \ge 0\}, \\
\mathcal{D}^{\le 0} &amp;= \{Y \in \mathcal{D} \colon \operatorname{Hom}(Y, \mathcal{D}^{\ge 1}) = 0\},
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
can be shown to be a t-structure.&lt;ref&gt;Beligiannis, Apostolos; Reiten, Idun. ''Homological and homotopical aspects of torsion theories.''  Mem. Amer. Math. Soc.  188  (2007),  no. 883, viii+207 pp. Theorem III.2.3&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting ''t''-structure is said to be '''generated by &lt;math&gt;S_0&lt;/math&gt;'''.

Given an abelian subcategory &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; of a triangulated category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;, it is possible to construct a subcategory of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; and a ''t''-structure on that subcategory whose heart is &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Beilinson, Bernstein, and Deligne, proposition 1.3.13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related concepts==
If the requirement &lt;math&gt;D^{\le 0}\subset D^{\le 1}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;D^{\ge 1}\subset D^{\ge 0};&lt;/math&gt; is replaced by the opposite inclusion
:&lt;math&gt;D^{\le 0}\supset D^{\le 1}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;D^{\ge 1}\supset D^{\ge 0},&lt;/math&gt;
and the other two axioms kept the same, the resulting notion is called a ''co-t-structure'' or ''weight structure''.&lt;ref&gt;Bondarko, M. V. ''Weight structures vs. t-structures; weight filtrations, spectral sequences, and complexes (for motives and in general).''  J. K-Theory  6  (2010),  no. 3, 387–504.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Br'er Rabbit and Tar-Baby.jpg|thumb|250px|Br'er Rabbit and the Tar-Baby, drawing by [[E.W. Kemble]] from The Tar-Baby, by [[Joel Chandler Harris]], 1904]]

The '''Tar-Baby''' is the second of the [[Uncle Remus]] stories published in 1880; it is about a doll made of [[tar]] and [[turpentine]] used by the [[villain]]ous [[Br'er Fox]] to entrap [[Br'er Rabbit]]. The more that Br'er Rabbit fights the Tar-Baby, the more entangled he becomes. 

In modern usage, ''tar baby'' refers to a problem situation that is only aggravated by additional involvement with it.

== Story ==
{{see also|cautionary tale|reverse psychology}}
[[File:Brer Rabbit and the Tar Baby.jpg|thumb|200px|Br'er Rabbit attacking the Tar-Baby, 1895 illustration]]
In one tale, [[Br'er Fox]] constructs a doll out of a lump of tar and dresses it with some clothes. When [[Br'er Rabbit]] comes along, he addresses the tar "baby" amiably, but receives no response. Br'er Rabbit becomes offended by what he perceives as the tar baby's lack of manners, punches it and, in doing so, becomes stuck. The more Br'er Rabbit punches and kicks the tar baby out of rage, the worse he gets stuck. 

Now that Br'er Rabbit is stuck, Br'er Fox ponders how to dispose of him. The helpless but cunning Br'er Rabbit pleads, "Do anything you want with me --- roas' me, hang me, skin me, drown me --- but please, Br'er Fox, don't fling me in dat brier-patch," prompting the sadistic Br'er Fox to do exactly that because he gullibly believes it will inflict the maximum pain on Br'er Rabbit. As rabbits are at home in thickets, however, the resourceful Br'er Rabbit escapes. 

The story was originally published in ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' by [[Robert Roosevelt]]; years later [[Joel Chandler Harris]] wrote of the Tar-Baby in his [[Uncle Remus]] stories.

Variations on the tar-baby legend are found in the folklore of more than one culture. In the ''Journal of American Folklore'', Aurelio M.

A very similar [[West Africa]]n tale is told of the [[mythical]] hero [[Anansi]] the Spider. In this version, Anansi creates a wooden doll and covers it over with gum, then puts a plate of yams in its lap, in order to capture the she-fairy Mmoatia (sometimes described as an "elf" or "dwarf"). Mmoatia takes the bait and eats the yams, but grows angry when the doll does not respond and strikes it, becoming stuck in the process. 

In [[The Bahamas]], the Tar-Baby story was published by ''The Journal of American Folklore'' in the year 1891 in ''Some Tales from Bahama Folk-Lore'' by [[Charles Lincoln Edwards]]. Edwards had collected the stories from Green Turtle Cay, Abaco in the summer of 1888.

In the tale, B' Rabby refused to dig for water, and didn't help grow the field. He tricks B' Lizard and B' Bouki while they were standing watch by the water and the field. The other animals got tired of his tricks, got together and created a Tar Baby. B' Rabby was caught by Tar Baby and the other animals who wanted to throw him into the sea but he talked them into throwing him into a bush. They threw B' Rabby into the bush and he got away.&lt;ref&gt;Some Tales from Bahama Folk-Lore by Charles Lincoln Edwards page. 47 -

In a variant recorded in [[Jamaica]], Anansi himself was once similarly trapped with a tar-baby made by the eldest son of Mrs. Anansi, after Anansi pretended to be dead in order to steal her peas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/afr/jas/jas021.htm |title="Anansi and the Tar-baby", ''Jamaican Anansi Stories''|publisher=Sacred-texts.com |date= 1924|accessdate=2010-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[Spanish language]] version told in the mountainous parts of [[Colombia]], an unnamed rabbit is trapped by the ''Muñeco de Brea'' (tar doll).

The tar-baby theme is present in the folklore of various tribes of Meso-America and of South America: it is found in such stories&lt;ref&gt;Enrique Margery: "The Tar-Baby Motif", p. 9. In :- ''Latin American Indian Literatures Journal'', Vol. 6 (1990), pp. 1–13&lt;/ref&gt; as the [[Nahuatl]] (of Mexico) "Lazy Boy and Little Rabbit" (González Casanova 1946, pp.&amp;nbsp;55–67), [[Pipil people|Pipil]] (of El Salvador) "Rabbit and Little Fox" (Schultes 1977, pp.&amp;nbsp;113–116), and [[Palenquero]] (of Colombia) "Rabbit, Toad, and Tiger" (Patiño Rosselli 1983, pp.&amp;nbsp;224–229). In Mexico, the tar baby story is also found among [[Mixtec]],&lt;ref&gt;Dyk, Anne, ed. 1959. "Tarbaby." ''Mixteco texts'', pp. 33–44. (Linguistic Series 3.)

In ''American Indian Myths and Legends'', pp. 359–361. New York: Pantheon.&lt;/ref&gt; In this story, white men are said to have erected the pitch-man that ensnares [[Coyote (mythology)|Coyote]].

According to [[James Mooney]] in "Myths of the Cherokee",&lt;ref&gt;James Mooney, "Myths of the Cherokee", Dover 1995, pp. 271–273, 232–236, 450. Reprinted from a Government Printing Office publication of 1900. Also, [http://www.sacred-texts.com/nam/cher/motc/motc021.htm Cherokee tarbaby story]&lt;/ref&gt; the tar-baby story may have been influenced in America by the [[Cherokee]] "Tar Wolf" story, considered unlikely to have been derived from similar African stories: "Some of these animal stories are common to widely separated [Native American] tribes among whom there can be no suspicion of [African] influences. Thus the famous "tar baby" story has variants, not only among the Cherokee, but also in New Mexico, Washington [State], and southern Alaska—wherever, in fact, the pine supplies enough gum to be molded into a ball for [Native American] uses...". 

In the Tar Wolf story, the animals were thirsty during a dry spell, and agreed to dig a well. The lazy rabbit refused to help dig, and so had no right to drink from the well. But she was thirsty, and stole from the well at night. The other animals fashioned a [[wolf]] out of tar and placed it near the well to scare the thief. The rabbit was scared at first, but when the tar wolf did not respond to her questions, she struck it and was held fast. Then she struggled with it and became so ensnared that she could not move. The next morning, the animals discovered the rabbit and proposed various ways of killing her, such as cutting her head off, and the rabbit responded to each idea saying that it would not harm her. Then an animal suggested throwing the rabbit into the thicket to die. At this, the rabbit protested vigorously and pleaded for her life. The animals threw the rabbit into the thicket. The rabbit then gave a whoop and bounded away, calling out to the other animals "This is where I live!".

== Popular culture ==
[[Walt Disney Pictures|Walt Disney Studios]] released ''[[Song of the South]]'', which contains the Tar-Baby story, in 1946. The film was never released on VHS or DVD in North America due to concerns about racially insensitive content. The ride [[Splash Mountain]], which is in three of the [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Walt Disney theme parks]], is based on the stories by [[Uncle Remus]]. However, instead of the Tar-Baby, Br'er Rabbit is captured in a [[beehive]]. 

The Tar-Baby appears in the Toontown countryside in ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' and was featured as one of the guests in ''[[House of Mouse]]''.

"Lollipop and the Tar Baby" is a 1977 science fiction short story by [[John Varley (author)|John Varley]], which takes place in the lonely space at the edge of the Solar System, and is part of Varley's far-future "[[Eight Worlds]]" universe. It is not a simple re-telling of the original tale, but undertones of it appear in the way in which the story's protagonist finally resolves her predicament.

In an episode of ''[[The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh]]'', Rabbit and his friends build a tar baby-like "watchamadingle" out of glue and molasses in order to trap the Masked Offender, who is actually a disguised Tigger.

In [[Hollywood]]'s [[Roots (2016 miniseries)|''Roots'']] 2016 miniseries, which is given a contemporary perspective, a group of white men order [[Kunta Kinte]] to hand over his infant daughter Kizzy, referring to her by the historically inaccurate (thus [[historical revisionist]]) term "tar baby". (See Racist interpretation below)

===Idiomatic references===
The story has given rise to two American English idioms. References to Br'er Rabbit's feigned protestations such as "please don't fling me in dat brier-patch" refer to guilefully seeking something by pretending to protest, with a "briar patch" often meaning a more advantageous situation or environment for one of the parties. The term ''tar baby'' has come to refer to a problem that is exacerbated by attempts to struggle with it, or by extension to a situation in which mere contact can lead to becoming inextricably involved.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

=== Racist interpretation ===
Although the term's provenance rests in African folklore (i.e., the gum doll [[Anansi]] created to trap Mmoatia), some Americans consider ''tar baby'' to be a pejorative term for African Americans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/07/31/politics/main1851199.shtml Romney Apologizes For 'Tar Baby'], 2006-07-31.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] defines ''tar baby'' as "a difficult problem which is only aggravated by attempts to solve it",&lt;ref&gt;"tar, n.1".

A '''ternary plot''', '''ternary graph''', '''triangle plot''', '''simplex plot''', '''Gibbs triangle''' or '''de Finetti diagram''' is a [[barycentric coordinates (mathematics)|barycentric]] [[plot (graphics)|plot]] on three variables which [[summation|sum]] to a constant. It graphically depicts the ratios of the three variables as positions in an [[equilateral]] [[triangle]]. It is used in [[physical chemistry]], [[petrology]], [[mineralogy]], [[metallurgy]], and other physical sciences to show the compositions of systems composed of three species. In [[population genetics]], it is often called a [[de Finetti diagram]]. In [[game theory]], it is often called a ''[[simplex]] plot''.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Tuyls, "An evolutionary game-theoretic analysis of poker strategies", ''Entertainment Computing'' January 2009 {{doi|10.1016/j.entcom.2009.09.002}}, p.&amp;nbsp;9&lt;/ref&gt;

In a ternary plot, the proportions of the three variables {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}, and {{mvar|c}} must sum to some constant, {{mvar|K}}. Usually, this constant is represented as 1.0 or 100%. Because {{math|''a'' + ''b'' + ''c'' {{=}} ''K''}} for all substances being graphed, any one variable is not independent of the others, so only two variables must be known to find a sample's point on the graph: for instance, {{mvar|c}} must be equal to {{math|''K'' − ''a'' − ''b''}}. Because the three proportions cannot vary independently—there are only two [[Degrees of freedom (statistics)|degrees of freedom]]—it is possible to graph the combinations of all three variables in only two dimensions.

==Reading values on the ternary plot==
The advantage of using a ternary plot for depicting [[chemical composition]]s is that three variables can be conveniently plotted in a two-dimensional graph. Ternary plots can also be used to create [[phase diagram]]s by outlining the composition regions on the plot where different phases exist.

Every point on a ternary plot represents a different composition of the three components.

A parallel to a side of the triangle is the locus of points representing systems with constant [[chemical composition]] in the component situated in the vertex opposed to the side.

There are three common methods used to determine the ratios of the three species in the composition. 

The first method is an estimation based upon the phase diagram grid. The concentration of each species is 100% (pure phase) in each corner of the triangle and 0% at the line opposite it. The percentage of a specific species decreases linearly with increasing distance from this corner, as seen in figures&amp;nbsp;3–8. By drawing parallel lines at regular intervals between the zero line and the corner (as seen in the images), fine divisions can be established for easy estimation of the content of a species. For a given point, the [[mass fraction (chemistry)|fraction]] of each of the three materials in the composition can be determined by the first.

For phase diagrams that do not possess grid lines, the easiest way to determine the composition is to set the altitude of the triangle to 100% and determine the shortest distances from the point of interest to each of the three sides. By [[Viviani's theorem]], the distances (the ratios of the distances to the total height of 100%) give the content of each of the species, as shown in figure&amp;nbsp;1.

The third method is based upon a larger number of measurements, but does not require the drawing of perpendicular lines. Straight lines are drawn from each corner, through the point of interest, to the opposite side of the triangle. The lengths of these lines, as well as the lengths of the segments between the point and the corresponding sides, are measured individually. Ratios can then be determined by dividing these segments by the entire corresponding line as shown in the figure&amp;nbsp;2. (The sum of the ratios should add to 1).

==Derivation from Cartesian coordinates==
:[[File:ternary plot visualisation.svg|none|thumb|700px|Derivation of a ternary plot from Cartesian coordinates]]
Figure (1) shows an [[oblique projection]] of point {{math|P(''a'',''b'',''c'')}} in a 3-dimensional [[Cartesian space]] with axes {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}} and {{mvar|c}}, respectively.

If {{math|''a'' + ''b'' + ''c'' {{=}} ''K''}} (a positive constant), {{math|P}} is restricted to a plane containing {{math|A(''K'',0,0)}}, {{math|B(0,''K'',0)}} and {{math|C(0,0,''K'')}}. If {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}} and {{mvar|c}} each cannot be negative, {{math|P}} is restricted to the triangle bounded by {{math|A}}, {{math|B}} and {{math|C}}, as in (2).

In (3), the axes are rotated to give an [[Isometric projection|isometric]] view. The triangle, viewed face-on, appears [[equilateral]].

In (4), the distances of {{math|P}} from lines {{math|BC}}, {{math|AC}} and {{math|AB}} are denoted by {{math|''a''′}}, {{math|''b''′}} and {{math|''c''′}}, respectively.

For any line {{math|'''l''' {{=}} '''s''' + ''t'' '''n&amp;#770;'''}} in vector form ({{math|'''n&amp;#770;'''}} is a unit vector) and a point {{math|'''p'''}}, the [[distance from a point to a line|perpendicular distance]] from {{math|'''p'''}} to {{math|'''l'''}} is
:&lt;math&gt;\left\| (\mathbf{s}-\mathbf{p}) - \bigl((\mathbf{s}-\mathbf{p}) \cdot  \mathbf{\hat n}\bigr)\mathbf{\hat n} \right\| \,.&lt;/math&gt;

In this case, point {{math|P}} is at
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p} = \begin{pmatrix}a\\b\\c\end{pmatrix} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Line {{math|BC}} has
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s} = \begin{pmatrix}0\\K\\0\end{pmatrix} \quad\text{and}\quad
\mathbf{\hat{n}} = \frac{\begin{pmatrix}0\\K\\0\end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix}0\\0\\K\end{pmatrix}}{\left\|\begin{pmatrix}0\\K\\0\end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix}0\\0\\K\end{pmatrix}\right\|} = \frac{\begin{pmatrix}0\\K\\-K\end{pmatrix}}{\sqrt{0^2+K^2+{(-K)}^2}} = \begin{pmatrix}0\\\frac{1}{\sqrt 2}\\-\frac{1}{\sqrt 2}\end{pmatrix} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Using the perpendicular distance formula,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
a' &amp; = \left\| \begin{pmatrix}-a\\K-b\\-c\end{pmatrix} - \left( \begin{pmatrix}-a\\K-b\\-c\end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix}0\\\frac{1}{\sqrt 2}\\-\frac{1}{\sqrt 2}\end{pmatrix} \right) \begin{pmatrix}0\\\frac{1}{\sqrt 2}\\-\frac{1}{\sqrt 2}\end{pmatrix} \right\| \\[10px]
&amp; = \left\| \begin{pmatrix}-a\\K-b\\-c\end{pmatrix} - \left( 0 + \frac{K-b}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{c}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \begin{pmatrix}0\\\frac{1}{\sqrt 2}\\-\frac{1}{\sqrt 2}\end{pmatrix} \right\| \\[10px]
&amp; = \left\| \begin{pmatrix}-a\\K-b-\frac{K-b+c}{2}\\-c+\frac{K-b+c}{2}\end{pmatrix} \right\| = \left\| \begin{pmatrix}-a\\\frac{K-b-c}{2}\\\frac{K-b-c}{2}\end{pmatrix} \right\| \\[10px]
&amp; = \sqrt{{(-a)}^2 + {\left(\frac{K-b-c}{2}\right)}^2 + {\left(\frac{K-b-c}{2}\right)}^2} = \sqrt{a^2 + \frac{{(K-b-c)}^2}{2}} \,.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting {{math|''K'' {{=}} ''a'' + ''b'' + ''c''}},

:&lt;math&gt;a' = \sqrt{a^2 + \frac{{(a+b+c-b-c)}^2}{2}} = \sqrt{a^2 + \frac{a^2}{2}} = a\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Similar calculation on lines {{math|AC}} and {{math|AB}} gives

:&lt;math&gt;b' = b\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} \quad\text{and}\quad c' = c\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

This shows that the distance of the point from the respective lines is linearly proportional to the original values {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}} and {{mvar|c}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Vaughan |first=Will |title=Ternary plots |url=http://wvaughan.org/ternaryplots.html |date=September 5, 2010 |accessdate=September 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plotting a ternary plot==
[[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] are useful for plotting points in the triangle. Consider an equilateral ternary plot where {{math|''a'' {{=}} 100%}} is placed at {{math|(''x'',''y'') {{=}} (0,0)}} and {{math|''b'' {{=}} 100%}} at {{math|(1,0)}}. Then {{math|''c'' {{=}} 100%}} is {{math|({{sfrac|1|2}},{{sfrac|{{sqrt|3}}|2}})}}, and the triple {{math|(''a'',''b'',''c'')}} is
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{2b+c}{a+b+c},\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\cdot\frac{c}{a+b+c}\right) \,.&lt;/math&gt;

==Example==
This example shows how this works for a hypothetical set of three soil samples:

:{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"
!width="10%"|Sample number||width="10%"|Organic matter||width="10%"|Clay||width="10%"|Sand||Notes
|-
|Sample 1||80%||10%||10%||align="left"|Because organic matter and clay make up 90% of this sample, the proportion of sand must be 10%.
|-
|Sample 2||50%||40%||10%||align="left"|The proportion of sand is 10% in this sample too, but the proportions of organic matter and clay are different.
|-
|Sample 3||10%||40%||50%||align="left"|This sample has the same proportion of clay as in Sample 2 does, but because it has a smaller proportion of organic matter, the proportion of sand must be larger, because all samples' proportions must sum to 100%.
|}

A '''thematic map''' is a type of [[map]] specifically designed to show a particular theme connected with a specific [[geographic area]].

A 'Thematic map' is a map that focuses on a specific theme or subject area. This is in contrast to ''general reference maps'', which regularly show the variety of phenomena—geological, geographical, political—together.&lt;ref name="Thr07"&gt;{{harvnb|Thrower|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=cGeCNa_vookC&amp;pg=PA95 95]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Fundamentals of Mapping|url = http://www.icsm.gov.au/mapping/maps_general.html|website = www.icsm.gov.au|accessdate = 2015-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contrast between them lies in the fact that thematic maps use the base data, such as coastlines, boundaries and places, only as points of reference for the phenomenon being mapped. General maps portray the base data, such as landforms, lines of transportation, settlements, and political boundaries, for their own sake.&lt;ref name="Thr07"/&gt; 

Thematic maps emphasize spatial variation of one or a small number of geographic distributions. These distributions may be physical phenomena such as [[climate]] or human characteristics such as [[population density]] and [[health]] issues. Barbara Petchenik&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bartz Petchenik |first=Barbara |title=From Place to Space: The Psychological Achievement of Thematic Mapping |journal=Cartography and Geographic Information Science |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=5–12 |date=April 1979 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/cagis/cagis/1979/00000006/00000001/art00001 |doi=10.1559/152304079784022763}}&lt;/ref&gt; described the difference as "in place, about space." While general reference maps show where something is in space, thematic maps tell a story about that place&lt;ref&gt;[http://maps.unomaha.edu/Peterson/funda/Notes/Notes_Exam1/Maps&amp;GIS.htm Maps and GS] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312045425/http://maps.unomaha.edu/Peterson/funda/Notes/Notes_Exam1/Maps%26GIS.htm |date=2009-03-12 }}. Accessed 28 Feb 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g., [[city map]]).

Thematic maps are sometimes referred to as graphic essays that portray spatial variations and interrelationships of geographical distributions. Location, of course, is important to provide a reference base of where selected phenomena are occurring.

== History ==
[[File:Snow-cholera-map-1.jpg|thumb|[[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]]'s cholera map about the cholera deaths in London in the 1840s, published 1854.]]
An important cartographic element preceding thematic mapping was the development of accurate base maps.  Improvements in accuracy proceeded at a gradual pace, and even until the mid-17th century, general maps were usually of poor quality.  Still, base maps around this time were good enough to display appropriate information, allowing for the first thematic maps to come into being.

One of the earliest thematic maps was a map entitled ''Designatio orbis christiani'' (1607) by [[Jodocus Hondius]] showing the dispersion of major religions, using [[Map symbolization|map symbols]] in the French edition of his ''Atlas Minor'' (1607).&lt;ref name="Van der Dussen"&gt;{{cite book|last=Van der Dussen|first=Jan and Kevin Wilson|title=The History of the Idea of Europe|year=1995|publisher=Routledge|pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was soon followed by a thematic globe (in the form of a six-[[Gore (segment)|gore]] map) showing the same subject, using Hondius' symbols, by [[Franciscus Haraeus]], entitled: ''Novus typus orbis ipsus globus, ex Analemmate Ptolomaei diductus'' (1614)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Novus typus orbis ipsus globus, ex Analemmate Ptolomaei diductus 1614|url=http://www.shop.nsw.gov.au/agencypubdetail.jsp?agency=85&amp;publicationId=9202&amp;categoryid=15&amp;subcategoryid=67|accessdate=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

An early contributor to thematic mapping in England was the English astronomer [[Edmond Halley]] (1656–1742).&lt;ref name="Thr07"/&gt; His first significant cartographic contribution was a [[star chart]] of the constellation of the Southern Hemisphere, made during his stay on [[St. Helena]] and published on 1686. In that same year he also published his first [[terrestrial map]] in an article about trade winds, and this map is called the first [[meteorological chart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thrower|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=cGeCNa_vookC&amp;pg=PA97 97]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1701 he published the "New and Correct Chart Shewing the Variations of the Compass", see first image, the first chart to show lines of equal [[magnetic variation]]. 

Another example of early thematic mapping comes from London physician [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]].  Though disease had been mapped thematically, Snow’s cholera map in 1854 is the best known example of using thematic maps for analysis.  Essentially, his technique and methodology anticipate principles of a geographic information system ([[GIS]]). Starting with an accurate base map of a [[London]] neighborhood which included streets and [[water pump]] locations, Snow mapped out the incidents of [[cholera]] death.  The emerging pattern centered around one particular [[Soho#Broad Street pump|pump on Broad Street]].  At Snow’s request, the handle of the pump was removed, and new cholera cases ceased almost at once.  Further investigation of the area revealed the Broad Street pump was near a cesspit under the home of the outbreak's first cholera victim.

Another 19th-century example of thematic maps, according to Friendly (2008), was the earliest known [[choropleth map]] in 1826 created by [[Charles Dupin]]. Based on this work [[Louis-Léger Vauthier]] (1815–1901) developed the population [[contour map]], a map that shows the [[population density]] of Paris in 1874 by contours or [[isolines]].&lt;ref name = "MF08"&gt;[[Michael Friendly]] (2008). [http://www.math.yorku.ca/SCS/Gallery/milestone/milestone.pdf "Milestones in the history of thematic cartography, statistical graphics, and data visualization"].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==

[[File:A-ZStreet.jpg|thumb|Section of a Street/City map from a [[Geographers' A-Z Map Company]] Atlas ]]
Thematic maps serve three primary purposes. 
# They provide specific information about particular locations. 
# They provide general information about spatial patterns. 
# They can be used to compare patterns on two or more maps. 
Common examples are maps of demographic data such as population density. When designing a thematic map, cartographers must balance a number of factors in order to effectively represent the data. Besides spatial accuracy, and aesthetics, quirks of human [[visual perception]] and the presentation format must be taken into account.

In addition, the audience is of equal importance. Who will “read” the thematic map and for what purpose helps define how it should be designed. A political scientist might prefer having information mapped within clearly delineated county boundaries ([[choropleth map]]s). A state biologist could certainly benefit from county boundaries being on a map, but nature seldom falls into such smooth, man-made delineations. In which case, a [[dasymetric map]] charts the desired information underneath a transparent county boundary map for easy location referencing.

== Data terminology ==

A thematic map is '''univariate''' if the non-location data is all of the same kind.  Population density, cancer rates, and annual rainfall are three examples of univariate data.

[[Bivariate map]]ping shows the geographical distribution of two distinct sets of data.  For example, a map showing both rainfall and cancer rates may be used to explore a possible correlation between the two phenomena.

More than two sets of data leads to '''multivariate''' mapping.  For example, a single map might show population density in addition to annual rainfall and cancer rates.

== Mapping methods ==
[[Image:choropleth.gif|thumb|Choropleth map of water use.]]
[[Image:January 17 1982 500-Millibar Height Contours.png|thumb|Isarithmic map of [[barometric pressure]].]]
[[Image:USDA Hardiness zone map.jpg|thumb|Map of climate and plant [[hardiness zones]].]]
Cartographers use many methods to create thematic maps, but five techniques are especially noted.

=== Choropleth ===
[[Choropleth map]]ping shows statistical data aggregated over predefined regions, such as counties or states, by coloring or shading these regions. For example, countries with higher rates of infant mortality might appear darker on a choropleth map. This technique assumes a relatively even distribution of the measured phenomenon within each region. Generally speaking, differences in [[hue]] are used to indicate qualitative differences, such as land use, while differences in saturation or lightness are used to indicate quantitative differences, such as population.

=== Proportional symbol ===
The proportional symbol technique uses symbols of different sizes to represent data associated with different areas or locations within the map. For example, a disc may be shown at the location of each city in a map, with the area of the disc being proportional to the population of the city.

=== Isarithmic or  Isoline===
Isarithmic maps, also known as [[contour line|contour map]]s or isoline maps depict smooth continuous phenomena such as precipitation or elevation. Each line-bounded area on this type of map represents a region with the same value. For example, on an elevation map, each elevation line indicates an area at the listed elevation. An Isarithmic map is a planimetric graphic representation of a 3-D surface. Isarithmic mapping requires 3-D thinking for surfaces that vary spatially.

=== Dot ===
A [[dot distribution map]] might be used to locate each occurrence of a phenomenon, as in the map made by [[John Snow|Dr. Snow]] during the [[1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak]], where each dot represented one death due to cholera. Where appropriate, the dot distribution technique may also be used in combination the proportional symbol technique

=== Dasymetric ===
A [[dasymetric map]] is an alternative to a choropleth map. As with a choropleth map, data are collected by enumeration units. But instead of mapping the data so that the region appears uniform, ''ancillary information'' is used to model internal distribution of the phenomenon. For example, population density will be much lower in forested area than urbanized area, so in a common operation, land cover data (forest, water, grassland, urbanization) may be used to model the distribution of population reported by census enumeration unit such as a tract or county.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Terry A. |last1=Slocum |first2=Robert B. |last2=McMaster |first3=Fritz C. |last3=Kessler |first4=Hugh H. |last4=Howard |title=Thematic cartography and geovisualization |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P_URAQAAIAAJ |year=2009 |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |isbn=978-0-13-229834-6 |edition=3rd}} Ch. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tithing settlement''' is the name of a formalized series of meetings held at [[Ward (LDS Church)|local congregations]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church). During tithing settlement, each member of the church is individually interviewed by the [[Bishop (Latter Day Saints)|bishop]] or [[branch president]] of the congregation and asked to declare whether he or she has paid a full [[tithe]] to the church, which is defined as ten per cent of the member's income. Tithing settlement meetings are generally held in November or December.

During the meeting, each member is given a copy of his or her donation record for the year, and asked to confirm it is correct.

Each church member is required to choose one of the following tithing statuses as defined by the church:&lt;ref name="instructions"&gt;[https://www.lds.org/help/support/tithing-status?lang=eng], lds.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Full-tithe''' payers have paid one-tenth of their income as tithing. ([[Missionary (LDS Church)|Full-time missionaries]] and those completely dependent on church welfare assistance are also full tithe-payers.)
* '''Part-tithe''' payers have paid tithing, but the amount is less than one-tenth of their income.
* '''Non-tithe''' payers have not paid tithing during the year and (in the view of the church) are not exempt from paying tithing.
* Previously, '''Exempt''' members had no income and paid no tithing, but they declare that they would have paid a full tithe if they had income. But it appears that this classification has been recently removed.

Church members are invited to make a payment to correct any deficiency before the records are closed for year-end.

If a church member declines to participate or attend a tithing settlement meeting, the bishop or branch president is required to choose a tithing status on their behalf.&lt;ref name="instructions" /&gt;

Payment of tithing is a core doctrine of the church for all members, including children. Church members must declare themselves to be "full-tithe payers" in order to receive a [[temple recommend]] and attend one of the church's [[Temple (LDS Church)|temples]]. However, that is done in a separate meeting from the tithing settlement.&lt;ref name="Tithing Settlement"&gt;[https://tech.lds.org/wiki/index.php?title=Tithing_settlement Church Tithing Settlement Overview], lds.org&lt;/ref&gt;

The LDS Church uses the honor system and personal accountability of the individual tithe payer. It is not the church's general position to question the honesty of tithe payers. The church predominantly accepts the status declared by the tithe payer through counsel and consideration of the leaders. It is up to the individual tithe payer to determine and in turn declare to their leaders whether he or she feels they are a full tithe payer or not.

The lines running to the right are the tapes of genetic instructions, which are copied along with the body of the machines. The machine shown runs in a 32-state version of von Neumann's cellular automata environment, not his original 29-state specification.]]

[[John von Neumann]]'s '''universal constructor''' is a [[self-replicating machine]] in a [[cellular automata]] (CA) environment. It was designed in the 1940s, without the use of a computer. The fundamental details of the machine were published in von Neumann's book ''Theory of Self-Reproducing Automata'', completed in 1966 by [[Arthur Burks|Arthur W. Burks]] after von Neumann's death.&lt;ref name=TSRA&gt;{{Citation| url=https://archive.org/details/theoryofselfrepr00vonn_0| title=''Theory of Self-Reproducing Automata.''| author1=von Neumann, John| author2=Burks, Arthur W.| year=1966| publisher=University of Illinois Press| format=Scanned book online| archivedate=2015-06-24| accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Von Neumann's goal was to specify an abstract machine which, when run, would replicate itself. In his design, the machine consists of three parts: a 'blueprint' for itself, a mechanism that can read any blueprint and construct the machine (sans blueprint) specified by that blueprint, and a 'copy machine' that can make copies of any blueprint. After the mechanism has been used to construct the machine specified by the blueprint, the copy machine is used to create a copy of that blueprint, and this copy is placed into the new machine, resulting in a working replication of the original machine. Some machines will do this backwards, copying the blueprint and then building a machine.

To define his machine in more detail, von Neumann invented the concept of a cellular automaton. The [[Von Neumann cellular automaton|one he used]] consists of a two-dimensional grid of cells, each of which can be in one of 29 states at any point in time. At each timestep, each cell updates its state depending on the states of the surrounding cells at the prior timestep. The rules governing these updates are identical for all cells. 

The universal constructor is a certain pattern of cell states in this cellular automaton. It contains one line of cells that serve as a 'tape', encoding a sequence of instructions that serve as a 'blueprint' for the machine. The machine reads these instructions one by one and performs the corresponding actions. The instructions direct the machine to use its 'construction arm' to build a copy of the machine, without tape, at some other location in the cell grid. The tape can't contain instructions to build an equally long tape, just as a container can't contain a container of the same size. Therefore, the machine contains a separate 'copy machine' which reads the tape and places a copy into the newly constructed machine. The resulting new machine and tape is identical to the old one, and it proceeds to replicate again.

== Purpose ==

Von Neumann's design has traditionally been understood to be a demonstration of the logical requirements for machine self-replication.&lt;ref name=McMullin2000&gt;{{Citation|journal=Artificial Life|last=McMullin|first=B.|year=2000|title=John von Neumann and the Evolutionary Growth of Complexity: Looking Backwards, Looking Forwards...|volume=6|issue=4|pages=347–361|url=http://www.eeng.dcu.ie/~alife/bmcm-alj-2000/|doi=10.1162/106454600300103674|pmid=11348586}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is clear that far simpler machines can achieve self-replication. Examples include trivial [[Crystal growth|crystal-like growth]], [[template replication]], and [[Langton's loops]]. But von Neumann was interested in something more profound: construction, universality, and evolution.&lt;ref name="walenz.org"&gt;[http://www.walenz.org/vonNeumann/page0110.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613231149/http://www.walenz.org/vonNeumann/page0110.html |date=June 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This universal constructor can be seen as an abstract [[simulation]] of a physical [[universal assembler]].

Note that the simpler self-replicating CA structures (especially, [[Byl's loop]] and the [[Chou–Reggia loop]]) cannot exist in a wide variety of forms and thus have very limited [[evolvability]]. Other CA structures such as the [[Evoloop]] are somewhat evolvable but still don't support open-ended evolution. Commonly, simple replicators do not fully contain the machinery of construction, there being a degree to which the replicator is information copied by its surrounding environment. Although the Von Neumann design is a logical construction, it is in principle a design that could be instantiated as a physical machine. The issue of the environmental contribution to replication is somewhat open, since there are different conceptions of raw material and its availability.

The concept of a ''universal constructor'' is non-trivial because of the existence of [[Garden of Eden (cellular automaton)|Garden of Eden patterns]]. But a simple definition is that a universal constructor is able to construct any finite pattern of non-excited (quiescent) cells.

Von Neumann's crucial insight is that part of the replicator has a double use; being both an active component of the construction mechanism, and being the target of a passive copying process. This part is played by the tape of instructions in Von Neumann's combination of universal constructor plus instruction tape.

The combination of a universal constructor and a tape of instructions would i) allow self-replication, and also ii) guarantee that the open-ended complexity growth observed in biological organisms was possible.&lt;ref name=McMullin2000/&gt; The image below illustrates this possibility.

This insight is all the more remarkable because it preceded the discovery of the structure of the DNA molecule by [[James Watson|Watson]] and [[Francis Crick|Crick]], though it followed the [[Avery–MacLeod–McCarty experiment]] which identified [[DNA]] as the molecular carrier of genetic information in living organisms.&lt;ref name=Rocha_lec_notes&gt;{{citation |last=Rocha|first=Luis M.|title=Lecture Notes of I-585-Biologically Inspired Computing Course, Indiana University|contribution=Von Neumann and Natural Selection.|url=http://informatics.indiana.edu/rocha/i-bic/pdfs/ibic_lecnotes_c6.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DNA molecule is processed by separate mechanisms that carry out its instructions and copy the DNA for insertion for the newly constructed cell. The ability to achieve open-ended evolution lies in the fact that, just as in nature, errors ([[mutations]]) in the copying of the genetic tape can lead to viable variants of the automaton, which can then evolve via [[Natural Selection|natural selection]].

[[Image:Pesavento replicator inherited mutations.png|thumb|center|700px|A demonstration of the ability of von Neumann's machine to support inheritable mutations. (1) At an earlier timestep, a mutation was manually added to the second generation machine's tape. (2) Later generations both display the [[phenotype]] of the mutation (a drawing of a flower) and pass the mutation on to their children, since the tape is copied each time. This example illustrates how von Neumann's design allows for complexity growth (in theory) since the tape could specify a machine that is more complex than the one making it.]]

== Implementations ==

[[Arthur Burks]] and others extended the work of von Neumann, giving a much clearer and complete set of details regarding the design and operation of von Neumann's self-replicator. The work of J. W. Thatcher is particularly noteworthy, for he greatly simplified the design. Still, their work did not yield a complete design, cell by cell, of a configuration capable of demonstrating self-replication.

[[Renato Nobili]] and Umberto Pesavento published the first fully implemented self-reproducing cellular automaton in 1995, nearly fifty years after von Neumann's work.&lt;ref name=Pesavento1995/&gt;&lt;ref name=NobiliPesavento1996&gt;{{Citation|last=Nobili|first=Renato|last2=Pesavento|first2=Umberto|contribution=Generalised von Neumann's Automata|title=Proc. Artificial Worlds and Urban Studies, Conference 1|year=1996|editor-last=Besussi|editor-first=E.|editor2-last=Cecchini|editor2-first=A.|location=Venice|publisher=DAEST|url=http://www.pd.infn.it/%7Ernobili/pdf_files/jvnconstr.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; They used a 32-state cellular automaton instead of von Neumann's original [[Von Neumann cellular automaton|29-state specification]], extending it to allow for easier signal-crossing, explicit memory function and a more compact design. They also published an implementation of a general constructor within the original 29-state CA but not one capable of complete replication - the configuration cannot duplicate its tape, nor can it trigger its offspring; the configuration can only construct.&lt;ref name=NobiliPesavento1996/&gt;&lt;ref name=Automata2008/&gt;

In 2004, D. Mange et al. reported an implementation of a self-replicator that is consistent with the designs of von Neumann.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|journal=Proceedings of the IEEE| title=A Macroscopic View of Self-replication| volume=92| issue=12| first=Daniel| last=Mange|last2=Stauffer|first2=A.|last3=Peparaolo|first3=L.|last4=Tempesti|first4=G.| pages=1929–1945| year=2004|doi=10.1109/JPROC.2004.837631}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Nobili published a 32-state implementation that uses [[run-length encoding]] to greatly reduce the size of the tape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pd.infn.it/~rnobili/wjvn/index.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 29, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110129003524/http://www.pd.infn.it/~rnobili/wjvn/index.htm |archivedate=January 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, William R. Buckley published two configurations which are self-replicators within the original 29-state CA of von Neumann.&lt;ref name=Automata2008&gt;{{Citation|title=Proc. Automata 2008|contribution=Signal Crossing Solutions in von Neumann Self-replicating Cellular Automata| year=2008| first=William R.| last=Buckley|editor=[[Andrew Adamatzky]] |editor2=Ramon Alonso-Sanz |editor3=Anna Lawniczak |editor4=Genaro Juarez Martinez |editor5=Kenichi Morita |editor6=Thomas Worsch |pages=453–503|publisher=Luniver Press|url=http://uncomp.uwe.ac.uk/free-books/automata2008reducedsize.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buckley claims that the crossing of signal within von Neumann 29-state cellular automata is not necessary to the construction of self-replicators.&lt;ref name=Automata2008/&gt; Buckley also points out that for the purposes of evolution, each replicator should return to its original configuration after replicating, in order to be capable (in theory) of making more than one copy. As published, the 1995 design of Nobili-Pesavento does not fulfill this requirement but the 2007 design of Nobili does; the same is true of Buckley's configurations.

In 2009, Buckley published with [[Golly (program)|Golly]] a third configuration for von Neumann 29-state cellular automata, which can perform either holistic self-replication, or self-replication by partial construction.  This configuration also demonstrates that signal crossing is not necessary to the construction of self-replicators within von Neumann 29-state cellular automata.

C. L. Nehaniv in 2002, and also Y. Takada et al. in 2004, proposed a universal constructor directly implemented upon an asynchronous cellular automaton, rather than upon a synchronous cellular automaton.

As defined by von Neumann, universal construction entails the construction of passive configurations, only. As such, the concept of universal construction constituted nothing more than a literary (or, in this case, mathematical) device. It facilitated other proof, such as that a machine well constructed may engage in self-replication, while universal construction itself was simply assumed over a most minimal case. Universal construction under this standard is trivial. Hence, while all the configurations given here can construct any passive configuration, none can construct the real-time crossing organ devised by Gorman.&lt;ref name="Automata2008"/&gt;

== Practicality ==

=== Computational cost ===

All the implementations of von Neumann's self-reproducing machine require considerable resources to run on computer. For example, in the Nobili-Pesavento 32-state implementation shown above, while the body of the machine is just 6,329 non-empty cells (within a rectangle of size 97x170), it requires a tape that is 145,315 cells long, and takes 63 billion timesteps to replicate. A simulator running at 1,000 timesteps per second would take over 2 years to make the first copy. In 1995, when the first implementation was published, the authors had not seen their own machine replicate. However, in 2008, the [[hashlife]] algorithm was extended to support the 29-state and 32-state rulesets in [[Golly (program)|Golly]]. On a modern desktop PC, replication now takes only a few minutes, although a significant amount of memory is required.

=== Evolvability ===

It has been argued that the problem Von Neumann was trying to address was not self-reproduction ''per se'', but the evolutionary growth of complexity.&lt;ref name=McMullin2000/&gt; His “proof-of-principle” designs showed how it is logically possible, by using a general purpose programmable (“universal”) constructor, to exhibit an indefinitely large class of self-reproducing machines, spanning a wide range of “complexity” (in von Neumann's sense of “the ability to do complicated things”), interconnected by a network of potential mutational pathways, including pathways from the most simple to the most complex. This is an important result, as prior to that it might have been conjectured that there is a fundamental logical barrier to the existence of such pathways; in which case, biological organisms, which do support such pathways, could not be “machines”, as conventionally understood. But the result does not show what ''other'' conditions are necessary, in practice, for evolution along such pathways from simple to complex to be spontaneously realised or followed. In his unfinished work he briefly considers conflict and interactions between his self-reproducing machines;&lt;ref name="TSRA"/&gt;{{rp|147}} but in practice, his particular model cannot yield evolutionary dynamics because the machines are too fragile - the vast majority of perturbations cause them effectively to disintegrate.&lt;ref name=McMullin2000/&gt;
