== History and development of method ==
Use of organic solvents for clearing (making transparent) the tissue was first mentioned more than century ago by German anatomist [[Werner Spalteholz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/11138774|title=Über das Durchsichtigmachen von menschlichen und tierischen Präparaten und seine theoretischen Bedingungen, nebst Anhang: Über Knochenfärbung.|last=Spalteholz|first=Werner|date=1914|publisher=S.

Their renaissance came in last decade, probably thank to spread of advanced techniques of fluorescence microscopy which allow [[optical sectioning]] of the specimen ([[Confocal microscopy|confocal]], [[Two-photon excitation microscopy|multiphoton]] or [[Light sheet fluorescence microscopy|light sheet microscopy]]).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Silvestri|first=Ludovico|last2=Costantini|first2=Irene|last3=Sacconi|first3=Leonardo|last4=Pavone|first4=Francesco Saverio|date=March 2016|title=Clearing of fixed tissue: a review from a microscopist’s perspective|url=https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/Journal-of-Biomedical-Optics/volume-21/issue-8/081205/Clearing-of-fixed-tissue--a-review-from-a-microscopists/10.1117/1.JBO.21.8.081205.short|journal=Journal of Biomedical Optics|volume=21|issue=8|pages=081205|doi=10.1117/1.jbo.21.8.081205|issn=1083-3668}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of actual [[clearing techniques]], first used organic solvent was mixture of [[benzyl alcohol]] and [[benzyl benzoate]] (BABB). Authors used this solution to clear mouse brain, mouse embryos and whole body of ''D. melanogaster''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dodt|first=Hans-Ulrich|last2=Leischner|first2=Ulrich|last3=Schierloh|first3=Anja|last4=Jährling|first4=Nina|last5=Mauch|first5=Christoph Peter|last6=Deininger|first6=Katrin|last7=Deussing|first7=Jan Michael|last8=Eder|first8=Matthias|last9=Zieglgänsberger|first9=Walter|date=April 2007|title=Ultramicroscopy: three-dimensional visualization of neuronal networks in the whole mouse brain|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth1036|journal=Nature Methods|language=En|volume=4|issue=4|pages=331–336|doi=10.1038/nmeth1036|issn=1548-7105}}&lt;/ref&gt; Main drawback of this solution is bleaching of [[GFP protein|GFP]] signal and insufficient clearing of highly myelinated tissue of adult animals.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt; Therefore, many other reagents were tested with aim to find GFP compatible and more sufficient clearing. As results [[tetrahydrofuran]] (THF) and dibenzyl ether (DBE) were chosen as the best regents for clearing.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Becker|first=Klaus|last2=Jährling|first2=Nina|last3=Saghafi|first3=Saiedeh|last4=Weiler|first4=Reto|last5=Dodt|first5=Hans-Ulrich|date=2012-03-30|title=Chemical Clearing and Dehydration of GFP Expressing Mouse Brains|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0033916|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=7|issue=3|pages=e33916|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0033916|issn=1932-6203}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on those findings the 3DISCO protocol was published in 2012.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt;

== Procedure  ==
3DISCO protocol consists of three steps:

# initial dehydration performed with tetrahydrofuran (THF)
# following extraction of lipids via incubation in dichlormethane (DCM)
# immersion in dibenzyl ether (DBE) for RI matching

=== Principle and protocol ===
The biological samples (tissues) are heterogeneous structures consist of compounds which differ in their refractive indexes. For example, water have RI 1.33, lipids and proteins around 1.40 – 1.45.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Genina|first=Elina A.|last2=Bashkatov|first2=Alexey N.|last3=Tuchin|first3=Valery V.|date=November 2010|title=Tissue optical immersion clearing|journal=Expert Review of Medical Devices|volume=7|issue=6|pages=825–842|doi=10.1586/erd.10.50|issn=1745-2422|pmid=21050092}}&lt;/ref&gt; As result the light is scattered on its path through the tissue, which leads to decrease in resolution or even to disappearance of signal in samples thicker than few tents of micrometers. Series of steps including dehydration and delipidation of tissue and its subsequent incubation and imaging in medium with RI similar to imaged structures therefore decrease the scattering of light and leads to transparent sample.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Richardson|first=Douglas S.|last2=Lichtman|first2=Jeff W.|title=Clarifying Tissue Clearing|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0092867415008375|journal=Cell|volume=162|issue=2|pages=246–257|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2015.06.067|pmc=4537058}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ertürk|first=Ali|last2=Bradke|first2=Frank|title=High-resolution imaging of entire organs by 3-dimensional imaging of solvent cleared organs (3DISCO)|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0014488612004013|journal=Experimental Neurology|volume=242|pages=57–64|doi=10.1016/j.expneurol.2012.10.018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After fixation with (usually with [[paraformaldehyde]]) and eventually labeling with dyes, the samples are dehydrated via incubation in solutions with growing concentration (50%, 70%, 80% and 100% in water) of tetrahydrofurane (THF). Because its lack of reactive alcohol, aldehyde or ketone groups, THF is less reactive and preserve fluorescence better than other dehydrating solutions.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; After dehydration the sample is rinsed first in [[Dichloromethane|dichlormethane]] (DCM) and finally in dibenzyl ether (DBE) to match the refractive index of tissue and surrounding medium leading to transparent sample. In DBE samples are stored and imaged as well.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt;

=== Labeling ===
3DISCO protocol is best suited for fixed tissues labeled with strong fluorophores, ideally transgenic models expressing fluorescent proteins such as GFP (alternatively staining with synthetic dyes is possible as well).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; For antibody labeling the 3DISCO method was optimized and published under name iDISCO (see below Modifications and applications).&lt;ref name="Renier 896–910" /&gt;

=== Benefits and drawbacks ===
Whole process is relatively easy to perform and require just changes of given solutions with no need for some customized laboratory equipment. Process of clearing and subsequent imaging is fast (hours to days depending on sample size), especially in comparison with physical sectioning of whole organ, imaging of their parts and reconstruction before subsequent image analysis (that could easily take several weeks).&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Above that 3DISCO works on many types of tissues (lung, spleen, lymph nodes, mammary gland, tumors).&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Renier 896–910" /&gt;

Main drawbacks of this method are partial delipidation of tissue during clearing discriminating use of lipophilic dyes, shrinkage of tissue during clearing,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; partial degradation of fluorescence,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hama|first=Hiroshi|last2=Hioki|first2=Hiroyuki|last3=Namiki|first3=Kana|last4=Hoshida|first4=Tetsushi|last5=Kurokawa|first5=Hiroshi|last6=Ishidate|first6=Fumiyoshi|last7=Kaneko|first7=Takeshi|last8=Akagi|first8=Takumi|last9=Saito|first9=Takashi|date=October 2015|title=ScaleS: an optical clearing palette for biological imaging|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nn.4107|journal=Nature Neuroscience|language=En|volume=18|issue=10|pages=1518–1529|doi=10.1038/nn.4107|issn=1546-1726}}&lt;/ref&gt; complete degradation of fluorescence during long term storage&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt; and toxicity of used reagents (and their potential to damage the microscopy objectives if leak from imaging chamber).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lloyd-Lewis|first=Bethan|last2=Davis|first2=Felicity M.|last3=Harris|first3=Olivia B.|last4=Hitchcock|first4=Jessica R.|last5=Lourenco|first5=Filipe C.|last6=Pasche|first6=Mathias|last7=Watson|first7=Christine J.|date=2016-12-13|title=Imaging the mammary gland and mammary tumours in 3D: optical tissue clearing and immunofluorescence methods|url=https://doi.org/10.1186/s13058-016-0754-9|journal=Breast Cancer Research|volume=18|pages=127|doi=10.1186/s13058-016-0754-9|issn=1465-542X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modifications and applications  ==
Note that this chapter illustrates development and use of solvent-based clearing methods and does not provide complete list of applications and modifications of them.

=== Modifications ===
3DISCO method was soon after publication adopted by other researchers and modified with aim to specific goals, like use of retrograde&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Launay|first=Pierre-Serge|last2=Godefroy|first2=David|last3=Khabou|first3=Hanen|last4=Rostene|first4=William|last5=Sahel|first5=Jose-Alain|last6=Baudouin|first6=Christophe|last7=Parsadaniantz|first7=Stéphane Melik|last8=Goazigo|first8=Annabelle Reaux-Le|title=Combined 3DISCO clearing method, retrograde tracer and ultramicroscopy to map corneal neurons in a whole adult mouse trigeminal ganglion|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0014483515001967|journal=Experimental Eye Research|volume=139|pages=136–143|doi=10.1016/j.exer.2015.06.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Žygelytė|first=Emilija|last2=Bernard|first2=Megan E.|last3=Tomlinson|first3=Joy E.|last4=Martin|first4=Matthew J.|last5=Terhorst|first5=Allegra|last6=Bradford|first6=Harriet E.|last7=Lundquist|first7=Sarah A.|last8=Sledziona|first8=Michael|last9=Cheetham|first9=Jonathan|title=RetroDISCO: Clearing technique to improve quantification of retrograde labeled motor neurons of intact mouse spinal cords|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0165027016301194|journal=Journal of Neuroscience Methods|volume=271|pages=34–42|doi=10.1016/j.jneumeth.2016.05.017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or antibody labeling (iDISCO),&lt;ref name="Renier 896–910" /&gt; clearing whole body of mouse (uDISCO)&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; or clearing of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples (DIPCO).&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Authors of iDISCO (stands for “immunolabeling-enabled imaging of solvent-cleared organs“) included pretreatment of sample with methanol, hydrogen peroxide, [[detergent]]s and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) together with [[Immunolabeling|antibody labeling]] before clearing. This preprocess overcome two drawbacks of antibody labeling of large samples. First lowering the autofluorescence of samples and enhance signal-to-noise ratio, and second make tissue more penetrable for antibodies. As result samples as large as mouse embryos or whole mouse organs can be successfully dyed with fluorescent labeled antibodies and thereafter cleared and imaged.&lt;ref name="Renier 896–910" /&gt;

Authors of uDISCO (from “ultimate imaging of solvent-cleared organs“) enhance a shrinkage of tissue, a common bystander effect of dehydration of sample in first step of clearing. They used [[Tert-Butyl alcohol|tert-butanol]] instead of THF for dehydration and also different solution for imaging, which preserve fluorescence better than DBE. Thank to shrinkage of the tissue, they can observe large samples up to size of whole mouse body.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; It is worth to mention that uDISCO was highlighted by media worldwide including New York Times,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/23/science/transparent-mouse-udisco-glow.html|title=Seeing Through to a Mouse’s Nervous System|last=Fleur|first=Nicholas St|date=2016-08-22|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-14|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wall Street Journal,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-technique-shrinks-makes-whole-animals-transparent-1471878084|title=New Technique Shrinks, Makes Small Animals Transparent|last=Hernandez|first=Daniela|date=2016-08-22|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2018-04-14|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt; Business Insider,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.de/transparent-mouse-udisco-2016-8/?r=US&amp;IR=T|title=A 'revolutionary' new technology can turn mice clear — and might one day map your brain|work=Business Insider Deutschland|access-date=2018-04-14|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nature and Science&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/08/scientists-can-see-through-these-rodents|title=Scientists can see through these rodents|date=2016-08-22|work=Science {{!}} AAAS|access-date=2018-04-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; magazines.

DIPCO (from “diagnosing immunolabelled paraffin-embedded cleared organs”) is pipeline combine deparaffinization of FFPE embedded tumor specimens, iDISCO clearing and phenotyping of tumor tissue. Tumor FFPE samples are widely stored in biobanks and used for diagnostics, and their 3D analysis could potentially help to improve stratification of cancer patients.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Applications ===
Clearing methods, including 3DISCO, was mainly developed for [[neuroscience]] research first. The reason is in high morphological and functional complexity of [[nervous system]], which investigation is time-consuming and laborious with classical histology methods.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Belle|first=Morgane|last2=Godefroy|first2=David|last3=Dominici|first3=Chloé|last4=Heitz-Marchaland|first4=Céline|last5=Zelina|first5=Pavol|last6=Hellal|first6=Farida|last7=Bradke|first7=Frank|last8=Chédotal|first8=Alain|title=A Simple Method for 3D Analysis of Immunolabeled Axonal Tracts in a Transparent Nervous System|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2211124714009061|journal=Cell Reports|volume=9|issue=4|pages=1191–1201|doi=10.1016/j.celrep.2014.10.037}}&lt;/ref&gt; Majority of studies is therefore focused on mouse [[central nervous system]] (rodents are one of main [[model organism]]s for neurobiology). Authors of 3DISCO method used it first for studying regeneration in the central nervous system (CNS) of mouse, including counting of [[microglia]], [[astrocyte]]s and mapping trajectories of [[axon]]s after injury.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 3DISCO was also used for mapping the development of mouse CNS.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Its modification iDISCO was used for functional studies of brain activity&lt;ref name="Renier 896–910" /&gt; or for mapping [[amyloid]] plaques, microglia, vasculature and other properties of brains in [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer diseased]] patients and mouse models.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liebmann|first=Thomas|last2=Renier|first2=Nicolas|last3=Bettayeb|first3=Karima|last4=Greengard|first4=Paul|last5=Tessier-Lavigne|first5=Marc|last6=Flajolet|first6=Marc|title=Three-Dimensional Study of Alzheimer’s Disease Hallmarks Using the iDISCO Clearing Method|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2211124716308142|journal=Cell Reports|volume=16|issue=4|pages=1138–1152|doi=10.1016/j.celrep.2016.06.060}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modification uDISCO was then used for single cell mapping of neurons in whole unsectioned CNS of mouse.

In recent years the use of “DISCO” methods is broadened to research on many other tissues, including single-cell mapping of transplanted [[stem cell]]s in whole mouse organs,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; imaging of whole human embryos in different developmental stages&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; or examination and diagnostics of human tumors tissue.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

'''Agustín Feced''' (born June 11, 1921, died 1980s or 1990s) was a Major and Commander of the [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[Gendarmería Nacional Argentina|National Gendarmerie]], and the head of the Police of the [[Santa Fe Province|Province of Santa Fe]] for the city of [[Rosario]], during the [[Dirty War]]. He was in charge of the 2nd Regional Police Corps, and he was also part of [[Batallón de Inteligencia 601|Intelligence Battalion 601]] of the [[Argentine Army]] since June 1974, before the beginning of the military dictatorship, in the last days of the presidency of [[Juan Perón]].

He was born in [[Acebal, Santa Fe]]. He was officially declared dead in 1986 but this is disputed, it has been widely claimed that he was still alive after this date.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.elciudadanoweb.com/el-testimonio-de-la-sobrina-del-mas-cruel-torturador/|title=El testimonio de la sobrina del más cruel torturador|work=Diario El Ciudadano y la Región|access-date=2018-06-15|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disappearance==
Between 1976 and 1979, and already under the dictatorship of the [[Proceso de Reorganización Nacional]], Feced was the head of the Intelligence Service of the 2nd Corps, which doubled as an illegal detention center (the major one in the area, of a total of about 10). His office coordinated the repressive scheme in Rosario and its neighboring areas. People were kidnapped by squads and taken to the IS to be held and tortured. Feced is known to have taken part in the kidnappings, in torture sessions when the victim was for some reason interesting to him, and in the killings, which were often conducted in faraway locations and sometimes passed as fights between the police and armed terrorists. Two of Feced's foremost assistants in these crimes were [[José Rubén Lo Fiego]] and [[Mario Alfredo Marcote]].

The Intelligence Service is now a memorial site called ''[[Centro Popular de la Memoria]]'' (People's Memorial Center), preserved by an organization of victims' relatives.

==Initial investigations==
According to the extensive research conducted after the end of the Proceso, 720 people were "disappeared" in Santa Fe and 350 in Rosario. Feced, together with then-Commander of the 2nd Army Corps [[Leopoldo Galtieri]], is considered responsible for most of them. Before the closing of the case against him, Feced was accused of 270 crimes against humanity. Though Rosario had comparatively a smaller amount of "disappeared" people than other metropolitan areas, the proportion of those kidnapped that were set free from the detention centers and camps is also smaller, and there were many more victims of torture and murder.

The Supreme Council of the Armed Council started an investigation about Feced in 1983, and produced a large amount of documentation including lists of missing people, anonymous burials in a cemetery in Rosario, and tens of criminal collaborators.

==Feced's cover-up and alleged death==
This investigation took 3 years before it was passed on to the Federal Justice in Rosario. Feced was in theory to be in prison since the official opening of the case on January 31, 1984; later he was transferred by justice to the custody of the Military Hospital of Campo de Mayo (Buenos Aires). There he is claimed to have undergone heart surgery in 1985. At the time, though, he was in fact free in [[Formosa, Argentina|Formosa]]. These facts point to complicity and protection by many powerful interest (military, government officials, and some powerful businessmen such as [[Alberto Gollán]]). On July 21, 1986, Feced was officially declared dead by the Military Hospital.

Many witnesses, survivors of the IS, claim to have seen Feced alive after that date. An admission book of the Ariston Hotel in Rosario, presented as evidence to the court by journalist Claudio de Luca, showed a signature with Feced's handwriting, dated July 29, 1988. Francisco Oyarzábal, brother of a murdered victim, reported that Feced had been seen alive in [[Paraguay]].

The investigation of the Intelligence Service case was archived in 1987 after the passing of the laws called ''[[Ley de Obediencia Debida]]'' (Law of Due Obedience) and ''[[Ley de Punto Final]]'' (Full Stop Law), during the presidency of [[Raúl Alfonsín]], which restricted the accountability for human rights abuses to the highest levels of the military hierarchy (who had been already tried) and put an end to ongoing criminal investigations into the lower levels.

On December 15, 1989, the Penal Federal Court of Rosario, without giving weight to the above inconsistencies, declared the case against Feced extinct (closed) due to his alleged death. The rest of the people involved in the crimes of the Intelligence Service were [[pardon]]ed by decree of President [[Carlos Menem]] in 1989&amp;ndash;1990.

==Del Frade's research==
Research conducted by journalist Carlos del Frade since 1999, and published in 2002, shows that Feced's last recorded [[domicile (law)|domicile]] was in the city of [[Buenos Aires]]. Though he was supposedly ill and senile, one of his former neighbors, interviewed by del Frade, contradicts this impression.

Within the San Antonio Cemetery in Formosa, in the area reserved for members of the Gendarmería, there is a grave with the name of Agustín Feced, and an announcement in the local newspaper ''La Mañana'' says that he was buried there the same day of his death, at 5:30 PM. The official records of the cemetery show only one person being buried there and then, and it is not Feced; but he does appear in an old notebook also found there. The unofficial record in the notebook was written by Ramón Giménez, Feced's son-in-law and then a top government official. Feced's coffin is sealed in the wall next to another one that dates from the mid-1990s, and almost 3 meters above the ground. According to the guardian of the cemetery, San Antonio did not have lifts for coffins "until a few years ago" (1999), and work hours are 8:00 AM to 1:00 PM, so Feced could not have been buried like that "unless [somebody] brought three ladders and a lot of people to get [the coffin] up there."

==Re-opening of the case==
The case against the officers of the Intelligence Division, including Feced and many of his collaborators, was re-opened by federal judge Omar Digerónimo on September 6, 2004, who ordered a number of arrests. José Lo Fiego, Mario Marcote and another former police officer, José Carlos Scortechini, surrendered themselves almost immediately, but denying all the accusations.

'''Albert II, Margrave of Brandenburg''' (born: {{circa| 1177}}  – died: 25 February 1220) was a member of the [[House of Ascania]].  He was [[Margrave]] of [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]] from 1205 until his death in 1220.

== Life ==
Albert II was the youngest son of [[Otto I, Margrave of Brandenburg|Otto I]] and his second wife [[Ada of Holland]].{{sfn|Lyon|2013|p=241}} His father Otto I promoted and directed the foundation of German settlement in the area, which had been predominantly Slavic until the 12th century.

=== Count of Arneburg ===
Albert II was, from 1184 onwards, [[Count]] of [[Arneburg]] in the [[Altmark]].  The Altmark belonged to [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]], and his older brother [[Otto II, Margrave of Brandenburg|Otto II]] claimed that this implied that the Ascanians owned Arneburg.

Albert participated in the [[Third Crusade]] (1189–1192). After his return, he was temporarily imprisoned in 1194 by Otto for unexplained reasons. He was present at the inaugural meeting of the [[Teutonic Knights]] in 1198 in [[Acre (city)|Acre]].

=== Margrave of Brandenburg ===
Albert II inherited the Margraviate in 1205, after the death of his eldest brother [[Otto II, Margrave of Brandenburg|Otto II]].

In the dispute about the imperial crown between the Houses of [[Hohenstaufen]] and [[House of Guelph|Guelph]] in the early 13th century, Albert initially supported the Hohenstaufen King [[Philip of Swabia]], like Otto before him.  After Philip's assassination in 1208, however, he changed sides, because Emperor [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto IV]] had assisted him in securing the Margraviate against the Danes, and had confirmed Ascanian ownership of Brandenburg in a deed in 1212.

During this period, Albert II had a lengthy dispute with Archbishop [[Albert I of Käfernburg|Albert I]] of [[Diocese of Magdeburg|Magdeburg]]. He also played an important rôle in the [[Brandenburg tithe dispute]].

Albert II definitively secured the [[Teltow (region)|regions of Teltow]], [[Prignitz]] and parts of the [[Uckermark]] for the Margraviate of Brandenburg, but lost [[Pomerania]] to the [[House of Griffins]].

=== Death and succession ===
Albert II died in 1220.  At the time, his two sons were still minors.  Initially, archbishop Albert I of Magdeburg acted as regent.  In 1221, however, Albert's widow, Countess Matilda, took up the regency.  After her death in 1225, the brothers were declared legal adults and began ruling the Margraviate jointly.

== Legacy ==
Stephan Warnatsch describes Otto I's children as follows:{{sfn|Warnatsch|2000|p=26}}

''[They] continued the territorialisation drive that had been initiated [by their father] and, from the end of the 12th Century, as the [[Ostsiedlung|influx of settlers]] grew stronger, and, consequently, more people were available to develop the territory, started to expand into the areas of Ruppin, and in particular, Barnim and Teltow.  Moreover, the [[Oder]] region and the southern Uckermark were also targets of the Ascanian expansion.  In all these areas, the Ascanians ran into opposition from competing local princes.''

== Marriage and issue ==
In 1205, Albert married Matilda of Groitzsch (1185–1225), daughter of the Count [[Conrad II, Margrave of Lusatia|Conrad II of Lusatia]],{{sfn|Lyon|2013|p=241}} a member of the [[House of Wettin]], and wife Elizabeth, from the Polish [[Piast dynasty]].  They had four children:

* [[John I, Margrave of Brandenburg|John I]] (born: {{circa|1213}}; died: 4 April 1266)
* [[Otto III, Margrave of Brandenburg|Otto III "the Pious"]] (born: 1215; died: 9 October 1267)
* [[Matilda of Brandenburg, Duchess of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Matilda]] (died: 10 June 1261), married in 1228 Duke [[Otto I, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Otto I "the Child"]] of Brunswick-Lüneburg (1204–1252), a member of the [[House of Guelph]]
* [[Elisabeth of Brandenburg (1206-1231)|Elizabeth]] (born: 1207; died: 19 November 1231),&lt;ref&gt;Accurate data can be found in: Anton Ziegler (ed.), ''Historische Memorabilien des In- und Auslandes'', vol. 1, Lechner's Universitätsbuchhandlung, Vienna, 1846, chapter 82, right-hand column&lt;/ref&gt; married in 1228 Landgrave [[Henry Raspe]] of [[Thuringia]] (1201–1247)

{{Terrorist attacks in Pakistan}}

On 19 August 2017, Attaullah Shah, a prominent worker of [[Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F)]], was shot dead by unknown assailants at Bannu ada, [[Dera Ismail Khan]], [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]], [[Pakistan]]. No one claimed responsibility of the assault.

== Biography ==
Ataullah Shah originated from Paniyala and was leaving in [[Dera Ismail Khan]] for several years. He was a [[Spirituality|spiritual teacher]] and was serving as [[Khatib|Khateeb]] (sermon-giver) of a local mosque. Shah was considered a member of [[Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F)]] and was aide of its chief [[Maulana Fazl-ur-Rehman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.geo.tv/latest/154335-jui-fs-local-leader-shot-dead-in-di-khan|title=JUI-F local leader shot dead in Dera Ismail Khan|work=[[Geo News]]|first=Marwat|last=Saeedullah|date=19 August 2017|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/224716-JUI-F-leader-shot-dead-in-DI-Khan|title=JUI-F leader shot dead in DI Khan|work=[[The News International]]|date=19 August 2017|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

=== JUI (F)'s members' execution ===
In May 2017, [[2017 Mastung suicide bombing|a suicide bombing]] targeting [[Abdul Ghafoor Haideri]], a leader of JUI (F), left 25 people dead. However Haideri himself managed to escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shahid|first1=Saleem|title=28 die as Senate deputy leader survives bomb attack in Mastung|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1332799|accessdate=8 October 2017|work=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]|date=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current attack came weeks after Qari Haq Nawaz, leader of JUI (F), was shot dead by unknown assailants in [[Charsada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/1466983/jui-f-leader-qari-haq-nawaz-gunned-charsadda/|title=JUI-F leader Qari Haq Nawaz gunned down in Charsadda|work=[[The Express Tribune]]|date=26 July 2017|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Recent killings in the city ===
[[Dera Ismail Khan]] has been home to terrorism in the past. There had been many incidents of bombings. However, for the past half a decade, there had been no such incident in the city. The violence sparked again in August 2017. Two police constables were gunned down on August 11 near Kotli Imam Hussain Imambargah. Two days later, a government servant was shot dead at his doorstep in Maryali area. A milk-seller was critically injured due to firing in Eidgah on August 17.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1352559|title=JUI-F leader shot dead in Dera Ismail Khan|work=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]|first=Akbar|last=Ali|date=19 August 2017|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shooting ==
Shah was walking to home after offering [[Fajr prayer]]. In the way, gunmen riding on a motorcycle opened fire, and killed him. The gunmen managed to flee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://en.dailypakistan.com.pk/pakistan/jui-f-leader-attaur-rehman-shah-shot-dead-in-dera-ismail-khan/|title=JUI-F leader Ataullah Shah shot dead in Dera Ismail Khan|work=[[Pakistan Today]]|first=Ali|last=Sarfaraz|date=19 August 2017|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local police chief Amjad Khan says, "Attaullah Shah was walking towards home after praying at a mosque in the city of Dera Ismail Khan, when the assailants opened fire early Saturday morning."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nation.com.pk/national/19-Aug-2017/unidentified-gunmen-kill-close-aid-of-fazlur-rehman|title=Unidentified gunmen kill close aid of Fazlur Rehman|work=[[The Nation (Pakistan)]]|date=19 August 2017|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the news of his death spread, several workers of JUI (F) gathered at the hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abbtakk.tv/en/jui-f-leader-gunned-down-in-di-khan/|title=JUI-F Leader Gunned Down in D.I Khan|work=[[Abb Takk News]]|date=19 August 2017|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; No one claimed responsibility of attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/pakistan/hardline-islamic-party-leader-shot-dead-in-northwest-pakistan-4803574/|title=Hardline Islamic party leader shot dead in northwest Pakistan|work=[[The Indian Express]]|date=19 August 2017|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Security forces cordoned off the area and started a search operation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22001">In [[neurology]], the '''Bereitschaftspotential''' or '''BP''' (from [[German language|German]], "''readiness potential''"), also called the '''pre-motor potential''' or '''readiness potential''' ('''RP'''), is a measure of activity in the [[motor cortex]] and [[supplementary motor area]]  of the brain leading up to voluntary muscle movement. The BP is a manifestation of cortical contribution to the pre-[[motor planning]] of volitional movement. It was first recorded and reported in 1964 by [[Hans Helmut Kornhuber]] and [[Lüder Deecke]] at the [[Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg|University of Freiburg]] in [[Germany]]. In 1965 the full publication appeared after many control experiments.&lt;ref name="K&amp;D65"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF00412364|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/34700192_Hirnpotentialnderungen_bei_Willkrbewegungen_und_passiven_Bewegungen_des_Menschen__Bereitschaftspotential_u._reafferente_Potentiale._Ausz._(Mit_7_Textabb.)/file/79e415061c9c7f2b93.pdf|title=Hirnpotentialänderungen bei Willkürbewegungen und passiven Bewegungen des Menschen: Bereitschaftspotential und reafferente Potentiale|journal=Pflügers Archiv für die Gesamte Physiologie des Menschen und der Tiere|volume=284|pages=1–17|year=1965|last1=Kornhuber|first1=Hans H.|last2=Deecke|first2=Lüder}}; Englisch translation: {{cite journal | vauthors = Kornhuber HH, Deecke L | title = Brain potential changes in voluntary and passive movements in humans: readiness potential and reafferent potentials | journal = Pflügers Archiv: European Journal of Physiology | volume = 468 | issue = 7 | pages = 1115–24 | year = 2016 | pmid = 27392465 | doi = 10.1007/s00424-016-1852-3 | url = }}, [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lueder_Deecke/publication/305040327_Brain_potential_changes_in_voluntary_and_passive_movements_in_humans_readiness_potential_and_reafferent_potentials/links/578f652208ae9754b7eced8d.pdf PDF] (accessed October 21, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discovery ==
In the spring of 1964 [[Hans Helmut Kornhuber]] (then docent and chief physician at the department of neurology, head Professor Richard Jung, university hospital Freiburg im Breisgau) and [[Lüder Deecke]] (his doctoral student) went for lunch to the 'Gasthaus zum Schwanen' at the foot of the Schlossberg hill in Freiburg. Sitting alone in the beautiful garden they discussed their frustration with the passive brain research prevailing worldwide and their desire to investigate self-initiated action of the brain and the will. Consequently, they decided to look for cerebral potentials in man related to volitional acts and to take voluntary movement as their research paradigm.&lt;ref name="K&amp;D90"&gt;Kornhuber, H.H.; Deecke, L. (1990). Readiness for movement – The Bereitschaftspotential-Story, ''Current Contents Life Sciences'' '''33''': 14. (Citation Classic) [http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/classics1990/A1990CH18100001.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

The possibility to do research on electrical brain potentials preceding voluntary movements came with the advent of the 'computer of average transients' (CAT computer), invented by [[Manfred Clynes]], the first still simple instrument available at that time in the Freiburg laboratory. In the [[electroencephalogram]] (EEG) little is to be seen preceding actions, except of an inconstant diminution of the α- (or μ-) rhythm. The young researchers stored the electroencephalogram and [[electromyogram]] of self-initiated movements (fast finger flexions) on tape and analyzed the cerebral potentials preceding movements time-reversed with the start of the movement as the trigger, literally turning the tape over for analysis since they had no reversal playback or programmable computer. A potential preceding human voluntary movement was discovered and published in the same year.&lt;ref name="K&amp;D64"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kornhuber | first1 = H.H. | last2 = Deecke | first2 = L. | year = 1964 | title = Hirnpotentialänderungen beim Menschen vor und nach Willkürbewegungen, dargestellt mit Magnetbandspeicherung und Rückwärtsanalyse | url = | journal = Pflügers Arch Eur J Physiologie | volume = 281 | issue = | page = 52 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After detailed investigation and control experiments such as passive finger movements the [[Citation Classic]] with the term ''Bereitschaftspotential'' was published.&lt;ref name="K&amp;D90" /&gt;

== Mechanism ==
[[File:Bereitschaftspotenzial fig1.jpg|frame|right|Typical recording of a Bereitschaftspotential]]
The BP is ten to hundred times smaller than the [[alpha wave|α-rhythm]] of the EEG; only by averaging, relating the electrical potentials to the onset of the movement it becomes apparent. Figure shows the typical slow shifts of the cortical DC potential, called Bereitschaftspotential, preceding volitional, rapid [[flexion]]s of the right index finger. The vertical line indicates the instant of triggering t = 0 (first activity in the EMG of the agonist muscle). Recording positions are left precentral (L prec, C3), right precentral (R prec, C4), mid-parietal (Pz); these are unipolar recordings with linked ears as reference. The difference between the BP in C3 and in C4 is displayed in the lowest graph (L/R prec). Superimposed are the results of eight experiments as obtained in the same subject (B.L.) on different days. see Deecke, L.; Grözinger, B.; Kornhuber H.H. (1976)

Note that the BP has two components, the early one (BP1) lasting from about −1.2 to −0.5; the late component (BP2) from −0.5 to shortly before 0 sec.&lt;ref name="Deeckeetal76"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Deecke | first1 = L. | last2 = Grözinger | first2 = B. | last3 = Kornhuber | first3 = H.H. | year = 1976 | title = Voluntary finger movement in man: Cerebral potentials and theory | url = | journal = Biol Cybern | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 99–119 | doi=10.1007/bf00336013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pre-motion positivity is even smaller, and the motor-potential which starts about fifty to sixty milliseconds before the onset of movement and has its maximum over the contralateral precentral hand area is still smaller. Thus, it takes great care to see these potentials: exact triggering by the real onset of movement is important, which is especially difficult preceding speech movements. Furthermore, artifacts due to head-, eye-, lid-, mouth-movements and respiration have to be eliminated before averaging because such artifacts may be of a magnitude which makes it difficult to render them negligible even after hundreds of sweeps.&lt;ref name="Grözingeretal80"&gt;Grözinger, B.; Kornhuber, H.H.; Kriebel, J.; Szirtes, J.; Westphal, K.T.P. (1980). The Bereitschaftspotential preceding the act of speaking. Also an analysis of artifacts. pp 798–804 in Kornhuber H.H., Deecke L., eds., Motivation, motor and sensory processes of the brain: Electrical potentials, behaviour and clinical use. ''[[Progr Brain Res]]'' '''54''', Amsterdam, Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of eye movements eye muscle potentials have to be distinguished from cerebral potentials. In some cases animal experiments were necessary to clarify the origin of potentials such as the R-wave. Therefore, it took many years until some of the other laboratories were able to confirm the details of Kornhuber &amp; Deecke's results. In addition to the finger or eye movements as mentioned above, the BP has been recorded accompanying willful movements of the wrist, arm, shoulder, hip, knee, foot and toes.  It was also recorded prior to speaking, writing and also swallowing.&lt;ref name="Huckabeeetal03"&gt;Huckabee, M.L.; Deecke, L.; Cannito, M.P.; Gould, H.J.; Mayr, W. Cortical control mechanisms in volitional swallowing: the Bereitschaftspotential. ''Brain Topogr''. '''16''': 3–17 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

The magnetoencephalographic (MEG) equivalent of the Bereitschaftspotential (BP), 'Bereitschafts(magnetic)field' (BF), or readiness field (RF) was first recorded in Hal Weinberg's laboratory at Simon Fraser University Burnaby B.C. Canada in 1982.&lt;ref name="Deeckeetal82"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Deecke | first1 = L | last2 = Weinberg | first2 = H. | last3 = Brickett | first3 = P. | year = 1982 | title = Magnetic fields of the human brain accompanying voluntary movement.

Brain Res. | volume = 48 | issue = | pages = 144–148 | doi=10.1007/bf00239582}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was confirmed that the early component, BP 1 or BF1, respectively was generated by the supplementary motor area (SMA), including the pre-SMA, while the late component, BP2 or BF2, was generated by the primary motor area, MI.

A very similar – and equally important – [[event-related potential]] (ERP) component had earlier been discovered by the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[neurophysiologist]] [[William Grey Walter]] in 1962 and published in 1964. It is the [[contingent negative variation]] (CNV).&lt;ref name="Walteretal64"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Walter | first1 = W.G | last2 = Cooper | first2 = R. | last3 = Aldridge | first3 = V.J. | last4 = McCallum | first4 = W.C. | last5 = Winter | first5 = A.L. | year = 1964 | title = Contingent Negative Variation: an electric sign of sensorimotor association and expectancy in the human brain | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 203 | issue = | pages = 380–384 | doi=10.1038/203380a0 | pmid=14197376}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ray Cooper: ''The discovery of the contingent negative variation (CNV)'', In: ''Current Contents Life Sciences'' 21, May 27, 1985, [http://garfield.library.upenn.edu/classics1985/A1985AHJ7800001.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; The CNV also composes two waves; the initial wave (i.e., O wave) and the terminal wave (i.e., E wave). The terminal CNV has similar characteristics as the BP and many researchers have claimed that the BP and the terminal CNV are the same component.&lt;ref&gt;Rohrbaugh, J.W.; Gaillard, A.W.K.: ''Sensory and motor aspects of the contingent negative variation''.

North Holland Publishing, Amsterdam 1983, {{ISBN|978-0-444-86551-9}}, pp. 269-310.&lt;/ref&gt; At least there is a consensus that both indicate a preparation of the brain for a following behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Cornelis H.

== Outcomes ==
The Bereitschaftspotential was received with great interest by the scientific community, as reflected by Sir John Eccles's comment: "There is a delightful parallel between these impressively simple experiments and the experiments of [[Galileo Galilei]] who investigated the laws of motion of the universe with metal balls on an inclined plane".&lt;ref name="E&amp;Z80"&gt;Eccles, J.C.; Zeier, H. (1980) ''Gehirn und Geist''. Zürich, Kindler.&lt;/ref&gt; The interest was even greater in psychology and philosophy because volition is traditionally associated with human freedom (cf. Kornhuber 1984).&lt;ref name="Kornhuber84"&gt;Kornhuber, H.H. (1984). Von der Freiheit pp 83–112 in Lindauer M, Schöpf A, eds., Wie erkennt der Mensch die Welt? Grundlagen des Erkennens, Fühlens und Handelns. Geistes und Naturwissenschaftler im Dialog. Ernst Klett Stuttgart.&lt;/ref&gt; The spirit of the time, however, was hostile to freedom in those years; it was believed that freedom is an illusion. The tradition of behaviourism and Freudism was deterministic. While will and volition were frequently leading concepts in psychological research papers before and after the first world war and even during the second war, after the end of the second world war this declined, and by the mid-sixties these key words completely disappeared and were abolished in the thesaurus of the American Psychological Association.&lt;ref name="Heckhausen87"&gt;Heckhausen, H. (1987). Perspektiven einer Psychologie des Wollens. pp 121–142 in Heckhausen, H. et al., eds., ''Jenseits des Rubikon: Der Wille in den Humanwissenschaften''. Springer, Berlin.&lt;/ref&gt; The BP is an electrical sign of participation of the supplementary motor area (SMA) prior to volitional movement, which starts activity prior to the primary motor area.&lt;ref name="D&amp;K78"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Deecke | first1 = L | last2 = Kornhuber | first2 = H.H. | year = 1978 | title = An electrical sign of participation of the mesial "supplementary" motor cortex in human voluntary finger movement | url = | journal = Brain Res | volume = 159 | issue = | pages = 473–476 | doi=10.1016/0006-8993(78)90561-9 | pmid=728816}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BP has precipitated a worldwide discussion about [[free will]] (cf. the closing chapter in the book "The Bereitschaftspotential").&lt;ref name="D&amp;K03"&gt;Deecke, L.; Kornhuber, H.H. (2003). Human freedom, reasoned will, and the brain. The Bereitschaftspotential story. In: M Jahanshahi, M Hallett (Eds.) ''The Bereitschaftspotential, movement-related cortical potentials''.

As said above, the activity of the SMA generates the early component of the Bereitschaftspotential (BP1 or BP early).&lt;ref name="D38"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Deecke L, Kornhuber  | year = 1978 | title = supplementary" motor cortex in human voluntary finger movements | url = | journal = Brain Res | volume = 159 | issue = 2| pages = 473–476 | doi=10.1016/0006-8993(78)90561-9| pmid = 728816 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The SMA has the starting function of the movement or action. The role of the SMA was further substantiated by Cunnington et al. 2003,&lt;ref name="D39"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cunnington R, Windischberger C, Deecke L, Moser E | year = 2003 | title = The preparation and readiness for voluntary movement: a high-field event-related fMRI study of the Bereitschafts-BOLD response | url = | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 20 | issue = 1| pages = 404–412 | doi=10.1016/s1053-8119(03)00291-x| pmid = 14527600 }}&lt;/ref&gt; showing that SMA proper and pre-SMA are active prior to volitional movement or action, as well as the cingulate motor area (CMA). This is now called ‘anterior mid-cingulate cortex (aMCC)’. Recently it has been shown by integrating simultaneously acquired EEG and fMRI that SMA and aMCC have strong reciprocal connections that act to sustain each other’s activity, and that this interaction is mediated during movement preparation according to the Bereitschaftspotential amplitude.&lt;ref name="D40"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nguyen VT, Breakspear M, Cunnington R | year = 2014 | title = Reciprocal interactions of the SMA and cingulate cortex sustain pre-movement activity for voluntary actions | url = | journal = J Neurosci | volume = 34 | issue = 49| pages = 16397–16407 | doi=10.1523/jneurosci.2571-14.2014| pmid = 25471577 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Electroencephalography|EEGs]] and [[Electromyography|EMGs]] are used in combination with [[Bayesian inference]] to construct [[Bayesian network]]s which attempt to predict general patterns of [[Motor Intent Neuron]] [[Action Potential]]s firing. Researchers attempting to develop non-intrusive [[brain-machine interface]]s are interested in this, as are system analysis, operations research, and epistemology (e.g. the Smith predictor has been suggested in the discussion). (explanation needed!)

=== BP and free will ===
In a series of experiments in the 1980s, [[Benjamin Libet]] studied the relationship between conscious experience of [[volition (psychology)|volition]] and the BP e.g.&lt;ref name="Libet85"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Libet | first1 = B | year = 1985 | title = Unconscious cerebral initiative and the role of conscious will in voluntary action | url = | journal = Behav Brain Sci | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 529–566 | doi=10.1017/s0140525x00044903}}&lt;/ref&gt; and found that the BP started about 0.35 sec ''earlier'' than the subject's reported conscious awareness that "now he or she feels the desire to make a movement." Libet concludes that we have no [[free will]] in the initiation of our movements; though, since subjects were able to prevent intended movement at the last moment, we do have the ability to veto these actions ("free won't").

These studies have provoked widespread debate.&lt;ref name="L&amp;dC10"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1007/s12152-009-9053-9|title=Not so Fast. On Some Bold Neuroscientific Claims Concerning Human Agency|journal=Neuroethics|volume=3|pages=23–41|year=2009|last1=Lavazza|first1=Andrea|last2=De Caro|first2=Mario}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also the recent extensive critique by Klemm, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Klemm, W. R. 2010 Free will debates: simple experiments are not so simple. "Advances in Cognitive Psychology,6: 47-65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kornhuber and Deecke have shown that we have free will also for the initiation of our movements and actions, not absolute freedom though, which would mean freedom from nature which is impossible but relative freedom—freedom in "degrees of freedom." According to Kornhuber and Deecke one can take efforts to increase one's degree of freedom through self-improvement, but one can also lose degrees of freedom through self-mismanagement, see below under "further reading" at third position Kornhuber and Deecke (2012).

In 2016, a group around [[John-Dylan Haynes]] in Berlin (Germany) determined the time window after the BP in which an intended motion could possibly be cancelled upon command.&lt;ref name="PMID26668390"&gt;{{Cite journal|pmc=4743787|year=2016|author1=Schultze-Kraft|first1=M|title=The point of no return in vetoing self-initiated movements|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=113|issue=4|pages=1080–1085|last2=Birman|first2=D|last3=Rusconi|first3=M|last4=Allefeld|first4=C|last5=Görgen|first5=K|last6=Dähne|first6=S|last7=Blankertz|first7=B|last8=Haynes|first8=J. D.|doi=10.1073/pnas.1513569112|pmid=26668390}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors tested whether human volunteers could win a “duel“ against a BCI (Brain Computer Interface) designed to predict their movements in real-time from observations of their EEG activity (the BP). They aimed to determine the exact time at which cancellation (veto) of movements was not possible anymore (the point of no return). The computer was trained to predict by means of the BP when a proband would move. The point of no return was at 200 ms before the movement. However, even after that, when a pedal was already set in motion, the subjects were able to reschedule their action by not completing the already started behavior. The authors pointed out in their report that cancellation of self-initiated movements had already been reported by Libet in 1985. Thus, the new achievement was a more precise determination of the point of no return.

== Applications ==
An interesting use of the Bereitschaftspotential is in [[Brain-Computer Interface]] (BCI) applications; this signal feature can be identified from scalp recording (even from single-trial measurements) and interpreted for various uses, for example control of computer displays or control of peripheral motor units in spinal cord injuries.&lt;ref name="Wangetal04"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wang | first1 = Y. | last2 = Zhang | first2 = Z. | last3 = Li | first3 = Y. | last4 = Gao | first4 = X. | last5 = Gao | first5 = S. | last6 = Yang | first6 = F. | year = 2004 | title = BCI competition 2003-data set IV: An algorithm based on CSSD and FDA for classifying single-trial EEG | url = | journal = IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering | volume = 51 | issue = 6| pages = 1081–1086 | doi=10.1109/tbme.2004.826697}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important BCI application is the 'mental' steering of artificial limbs in amputees.

'''Brighterion''' (est. in 2000) is an [[artificial intelligence]] company owned by [[MasterCard]].
== History==

Dr. Akli Adjaoute, while finishing his PhD in Artficial Intelligence &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.worldcat.org/title/rylm-generateur-de-systemes-experts-pour-les-problemes-daide-aux-diagnostics-ykra-systeme-denseignement/oclc/490376189|title=PhD in Artificial Intelligence ( DOCTORAT D’ETAT) |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Pierre and Marie Curie University|Pierre and Marie Curie University]], founded his first company, Conception En Intelligence Artificielle in 1988 in Paris, France where he was able to successfully apply his years of research in the field of artificial intelligence  in various industries throughout Europe. Conception En Intelligence Artificielle initially offered Rylm, a platform (MINDsuite) based on Smart Agents, Neural Networks, Business Rules, Genetic Algorithms, Constraint Programming, Fuzzy Logic and Cased-based Reasoning.

Rylm’s first application was in the decommissioning of nuclear facilities and [[nuclear waste management|Radioactive waste]]. This application was led by the team that invented the programming language [[Prolog|PROLOG]] and is described in the [http://brighterion.com/articles/rylm_nuclear.pdf Radioactive Waste Handling Operations paper]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://brighterion.com/articles/rylm_nuclear.pdf|title=Radioactive Waste Handling Operations paper|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Rylm’s second application was in healthcare at Necker Hospital as highlighted by the French magazine [http://brighterion.com/articles/rylm_healthcare.pdf L’Usine Nouvelle Technologies]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://brighterion.com/articles/rylm_healthcare.pdf|title=L’Usine Nouvelle Technologies|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Another application of Rylm was in network troubleshooting as described in the French magazine [https://web.archive.org/web/20170813104157/http:/brighterion.com/articles/rylm_network_troubleshooting.pdf 01 Informatique]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170813104157/http:/brighterion.com/articles/rylm_network_troubleshooting.pdf|title=01 Informatique|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The technology behind Rylm was also successfully applied in various other fields including: financials, supply chain, retail, and military.

Rylm has received recognition for its industry-leading technology including mention in the Meta Group report [https://web.archive.org/web/20170429211729/http:/brighterion.com/articles/rylm_metagroup_datamining.pdf Data Mining Market]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170429211729/http:/brighterion.com/articles/rylm_metagroup_datamining.pdf|title= Meta Group report Data Mining Market|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; for best [[Machine learning|Machine Learning]] Technology.

In 2000, this technology formed the foundation of Brighterion, Inc. and in 2002, [[Raymond Kendall|Raymond Kendall]], three-time Secretary General of [[Interpol|INTERPOL]] joined the company as its chairman. Since the founding of Brighterion, the core technology has been adapted and improved for real-time applications in the fields of homeland security, payment, compliance, IoT, healthcare, and marketing.

Brighterion has received multiple awards including: the Payment Security Excellence Award, the 2017 Cool Vendor by Gartner, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gartner.com/doc/reprints?id=1-413QTFK&amp;ct=170524&amp;st=sb|title=Cool Vendors in Identity and Fraud Management, 2017|access-date=2018-09-05|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Morgan Stanley Fintech Award&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.morganstanley.com/press-releases/morgan-stanley-recognizes-brighterion-with-fintech-award-at-firm|title=Morgan Stanley Recognizes Brighterion with Fintech Award at Firm’s Annual Fintech Summit 7|access-date=2018-09-05|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomgroenfeldt/2017/11/20/brighterion-anti-fraud-software-wins-morgan-stanley-first-fintech-award/|title=Brighterion's Artificial Intelligence Software Wins Morgan Stanley's First Fintech Award|author=Tom Groenfeldt|date=2017-11-20|work=[[Forbes]]|accessdate=2018-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''CAncer Personalized Profiling by deep Sequencing (CAPP-Seq)''' is a sensitive method used to quantify DNA in [[cancer]]. It measures [[Cell-free tumour DNA|Cell-free tumor DNA]] which is released from dead tumor cells into the blood. This method can be generalized for any cancer type that is known to have recurrent mutations.&lt;ref name="Newman"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Newman|first1=Aaron M|title=An ultrasensitive method for quantitating circulating tumor DNA with broad patient coverage|journal=Nature Medicine|date=2014|volume=20|issue=548|pmid=24705333|doi=10.1038/nm.3519|pmc=4016134|pages=548–54}}&lt;!--|accessdate=25 February 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; CAPP-Seq can detect one molecule of mutant DNA in 10,000 molecules of healthy DNA.

CAPP-Seq was designed to lower sequencing costs by only targeting specific areas of the genome that are recurrently mutated for a given cancer. This allows for sequencing costs between $200-$300 USD. It can also target multiple areas of the genome at once and a variety of different types of mutations, allowing for a lower amount of input DNA compared to other methods.

==Methods==

[[File:Wiki figure updated5.pdf|thumb|upright=2.6|'''Figure 01:''' An overview of the workflow of CAPP-Seq.]]

Population analysis is performed to identify recurrent mutations in a given cancer type. This is done by analyzing public data sets such as the [[COSMIC cancer database]] and [[The Cancer Genome Atlas|TCGA]].
A ‘selector’ is designed which consists of [[biotin]]ylated DNA oligonucleotide probes targeting the recurrently mutated regions chosen for the specific cancer type. The selector is chosen using a multiphase bioinformatics approach. Using the selector, a probe-based hybridization capture is performed on tumor and normal DNA to discover mutations specific to the patient. The hybridization capture is then also applied to ctDNA to quantify the mutations that were previously discovered.&lt;ref name="Newman" /&gt;

===ctDNA Extraction and Library Preparation===
Peripheral blood is collected from patients and ctDNA is isolated from ≥1 mL of [[Blood plasma|plasma]]. DNA libraries are made using the KAPA Library kit with some modifications in order to optimize protocols for use with ctDNA. The KAPA HiFi polymerase is used here because it is the most effective and produces the fewest number of errors. Input DNA can be as low as 4&amp;nbsp;ng.&lt;ref name="Newman" /&gt;

There were four main goals in adapting this protocol for ctDNA work:

*1) to optimize the adapter ligation efficiency
*2) to reduce the number of PCR cycles needed after ligation
*3) to preserve the naturally occurring size distribution of ctDNA (median 170 bit/s)
*4) to minimize the variability in depth of sequence coverage across all the captured regions

These were achieved by allowing adaptor ligation to be carried out at 16℃ for 16 hours to increase adaptor ligation efficiency and recovery. The most important adaptation is during enzymatic and clean-up steps; they are performed with-bead, in order to minimize tube transfer steps which increases recovery.

===Selector design===

In CAPP-Seq, design of selector is a crucial step that identifies recurrent mutations in a particular cancer type using publicly available next generation sequencing data. For inclusion in CAPP-seq selector, the recurrent mutations that are enriched in a population is described by an index- [[Recurrence Index]] (RI). RI is the number of mutations per kilobase of a given genomic locus of a patient carrying particular mutations. RI represents a patient level recurrence frequency estimated for somatic mutations and all mutations. Known and driver recurrent mutations in a population can be ranked based on the RI and therefore RI is used to design a selector. A six phase design strategy is employed to design selector.&lt;ref name="Newman" /&gt;

*Phase-1: Identifying frequently mutated known driver mutations using the publicly available data.
*Phase-2: Maximum coverage of SNVs among the patients was identified by ranking their exonic RI.
*Phase-3 and 4: Exons with higher RI were selected.
*Phase-5: Addition of previously predicted driver mutations.
*Phase-6: Addition of recurrent gene fusions rearrangement that are specific for particular cancer.

Human cancer is heterogeneous and recurrent cancer mutations are present only a minority of patient. Therefore, a careful and non-redundant design of selector is the vital part in CAPP-Seq and also the size of the selector is related to its downstream costs.

[[File:Capp-seq capture of DNA.pdf|thumb|upright=1.5|'''Figure 02:''' Hybridization capture protocol used in CAPP-Seq.]]

===Hybridization Capture and Sequencing===

Hybridization capture with the selector probe set is performed on tumor DNA from a biopsy and sequenced to a depth of ~10,000× coverage. The biotinylated selector probes bind selectively to the regions of the DNA library that were chosen to be where the recurrently mutations occur in the given cancer type. In this way you are left with a smaller library that is enriched for only the regions you want, which can then be sequenced. This allows the determination of patient specific mutations. Hybridization capture with the same selector is then performed on ctDNA from the blood to quantify the previously identified mutations in the patient. CAPP-Seq can be applied to ctDNA from multiple blood samples at different time points in order to follow tumor evolution.

==Computational pipeline for CAPP-seq==
A series of steps are involved in analysis of CAPP-Seq data from mutation detection to validation and open source software can do most of the analysis. After the first step of variant calling, germline and [[loss of heterozygosity]] (LOH) mutations are removed in CAPP-seq to reduce the background biases. Several statistical significance tests can be performed against background to all type of variant calling. For example, statistical significance of tumor-derived SNVs can be estimated by random sampling of background alleles using [[Monte Carlo method]]. For the indel calls, statistical significance is calculated applying a separate method that used a strand specific analysis by [[Z-test]] shown in previous work.&lt;ref name="Newman" /&gt; Finally, a computational validation steps reduces the false positive calls. However, a robust computational framework specific for CAPP-seq data analysis is a high demand in this field.

==Sensitivity==
Sensitivity of this technology depends on the effective design of selector and highly biased with the size of the cohort and type of cancer under study. The lack of background to find the statistically significant recurrent variants has limited its performance due to stochastic noise and biological variability. [[Receiver Operating Characteristic]] (ROC) analysis on several cancer patient and cancer cured patient (sample collected at different tumor stages, circulating DNA time point, treatment, etc.) showed that CAPP-seq has higher sensitivity and specificity compared to previous methods in non–small-cell lung cancer.&lt;ref name="Newman" /&gt;

==Limitations==

The detection limit of CAPP-Seq is affected by three main areas: the input amount of ctDNA molecules, sample cross-contamination, potential allelic bias in the capture reagent, and [[PCR]] or sequencing errors. CtDNA is able to be detected at a lower limit of 0.025% fractional abundance in the blood. Sample cross-contamination was found to be a very small contribution and reports have shown minimal allelic bias towards capture of reference alleles in PBLs ([[peripheral blood lymphocytes]]). PCR and sequencing errors are also minimal.&lt;ref name="Newman" /&gt;

It is important to note that when using CAPP-Seq on ctDNA it still currently not known whether ctDNA is released at equal rates from primary tumors and [[metastatic disease]], so this should be taken into consideration. This could cause problems with determining tumor burden and clonal evolution if different tumors or clones are dying off and releasing their DNA at different rates. It is also unknown how tumor histology affects ctDNA release.

Another major limitation with only using ctDNA levels to detect tumor burden is that ctDNA can only predict residual tumor, it cannot tell you where the tumor or tumors are located within the body. This means that ctDNA will be best used complementary to imaging for disease burden at this time.

==Advantages==

CAPP-Seq has many advantages over other methods such as [[digital polymerase chain reaction]] (dPCR) and [[amplicon]] sequencing. CAPP-Seq can survey many loci in the same experiment compared to dPCR and amplicon sequencing which use multiple different experiments and therefore use up much more sample. Another advantage is that CAPP-Seq can not only detect point mutations but it can also detect [[indels]], [[structural variations]], and [[copy number variations]].&lt;ref name="Bratman"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bratman|first1=Scott V.|title=Potential clinical utility of ultrasensitive circulating tumor DNA detection with CAPP-Seq|journal=Expert review of molecular diagnostics|date=2015|volume=15|issue=6|pages=715–719|pmid=25773944|doi=10.1586/14737159.2015.1019476|pmc=5052032}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another advantage of CAPP-Seq is that because it only targets specific areas of interest in the genome it is more cost effective than whole [[exome sequencing]] and [[whole genome sequencing]] which are 171X and 44X more expensive respectively.&lt;ref name="Newman" /&gt;

Using circulating tumor DNA as opposed to solid tumor biopsies allows analysis of the full repertoire of tumor cells dispersed throughout the tumor and distant metastasis. Therefore, there is a better chance of finding all mutations associated with this cancer. Having a full overview of the cancer and what is driving it will allow for better treatment plans and management of disease.

==Applications==

===Monitoring tumor burden===
When treating cancer it is useful to have precise measurements of the total body disease burden. It helps with determining prognostic significance and treatment response. This is normally done using computed tomography ([[CT scans]]), positron emission tomography ([[PET scans]]) or magnetic resonance imaging ([[MRI]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bar-Shalom|title=Clinical performance of PET/CT in evaluation of cancer: additional value for diagnostic imaging and patient management.|journal=J Nucl Med|date=2003|volume=44|issue=8|pages=1200–9.|pmid=12902408}}&lt;/ref&gt; These medical imaging procedures are expensive and are not without their own problems. These imaging techniques are not able to accurately resolve small tumors (≤1&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter).&lt;ref name="Bratman" /&gt; Imaging can also be affected by radiation-induced inflammation and fibrotic changes, making is hard to determine if there is residual tumor or just effects of treatment.&lt;ref name="Newman" /&gt;

It has been found that levels of ctDNA in plasma significantly correlate with tumor volume as compare with medical imaging (CT, PET and MRI).,&lt;ref name="Newman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bratman" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Diehl|first1=Frank|title=Circulating mutant DNA to assess tumor dynamics|journal=Nature Medicine|date=2007|volume=14|pages=985–990|pmid=18670422|doi=10.1038/nm.1789|pmc=2820391}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scherer"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scherer|first1=Florian Scherer|title=Noninvasive Genotyping and Assessment of Treatment Response in Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma|journal=Blood|date=2015|volume=126|issue=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Detection of ctDNA can predict residual tumor or imminent relapse, in some cases even better than medical imaging and current methods.

===Prognostic indicator===
Detection of ctDNA has been found to be a predictor of relapse in multiple studies thus far. In a study &lt;ref name="Bratman" /&gt; in late stage [[NSCLC]] (non-small cell lung cancer) they found two cases where ctDNA correctly determined the outcome of a patient when medical imaging was wrong. In one cause, the imaging predicted relapse based on a suspected residual tumor which turned out to only be radiation induced inflammation, but ctDNA was not detected and the patient did not relapse. In another case, the imaging showed no tumor but ctDNA was detected and the patient relapsed shortly afterwards. In another study &lt;ref name="Scherer" /&gt; on [[DLBCL]] (diffuse large B cell lymphoma), ctDNA was also found to be predictive of relapse.

===Biopsy-free tumor genotyping===
Biopsies are invasive and associated with risks to the patient. Therefore, multiple biopsies to monitor disease progression are rare and diagnostic biopsies are relied on for genetic information. This can be problematic because of tumor heterogeneity and tumor evolution. Firstly, biopsies only sample one portion of the tumor, and because tumors are heterogeneous, this will not cover the full genetic landscape of the tumor. Secondly, after treatment tumors evolve and there may be new mutations not represented in the diagnostic sample.&lt;ref name="Newman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bratman" /&gt;

Biopsy-free tumor genotyping, by way of CAPP-Seq and ctDNA, addresses many of these issues. A simple blood test is non-invasive and much safer and easier to subject cancer patients to multiple times through the course of treatment. Using ctDNA gives a better sample of tumor DNA compared to a single area of a tumor collected in a biopsy, allowing a better estimate of tumor heterogeneity. Taking multiple samples of ctDNA at different time points following the course of treatment allows tumor evolution to be uncovered. This can help detect the emergence of mutations that confer resistance to a targeted therapy and allow the course of treatment to be adjusted accordingly. CAPP-Seq specifically allows for the screening of multiple genomic locations which will become important as the list of cancer mutations important for treatment continues to grow.&lt;ref name="Bratman" /&gt; In a study&lt;ref name="Newman" /&gt; for late stage NSCLC, they performed a version of CAPP-Seq where the tumor biopsy was not sequenced first, and they were able to correctly classify 100% of patient plasma samples with a 0% false positive rate. This shows that even without previous knowledge of tumor mutations, they can be accurately discovered by ctDNA alone.

'''Dying Earth''' is a [[subgenre]] of [[science fantasy]] or [[science fiction]] which takes place in the far future at either the [[Future of the Earth|end of life on Earth]] or the [[Ultimate fate of the universe|End of Time]], when the laws of the universe themselves fail. Themes of [[Weltschmerz|world-weariness]], [[innocence]] (wounded or otherwise), [[idealism]], [[entropy]], (permanent) exhaustion/depletion of many or all resources (such as soil nutrients), and the hope of renewal tend to dominate.

==Genre==
The Dying Earth genre differs from the [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic science fiction|apocalyptic]] subgenre in that it deals not with catastrophic destruction, but with entropic exhaustion of the Earth. The genre was prefigured by the works of the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] movement. [[Jean-Baptiste Cousin de Grainville]]'s ''[[Le Dernier Homme]]'' (1805) narrates the tale of Omegarus, the Last Man on Earth. It is a bleak vision of the future when the Earth has become totally sterile. [[Lord Byron]]'s poem "[[Darkness (poem)|Darkness]]" (1816) shows Earth after the Sun has died.

Another early example is ''La Fin du Monde'' (''The End of the World'', aka ''Omega: the last days of the world''), written by [[Camille Flammarion]] and published in France in 1893. The first half of the novel deals with a comet on a collision course with earth in the 25th century. The last half focuses on Earth's future history, where civilizations rise and fall, humans evolve, and finally Earth ends as an old, dying, and barren planet.

Another early and more famous science fiction work to utilize the familiar Dying Earth imagery was [[H. G. Wells]]'s famous [[novella]] ''[[The Time Machine]]'' (1895). At the end of this work, the unnamed time traveller travels into the far future, where there are only a few living things on a dying Earth. He then returns to his own time to relate his tale to a circle of contemporaries.

Two brooding works by [[William Hope Hodgson]] would elaborate on Wells's vision. ''[[The House on the Borderland]]'' (1908) takes place in a house besieged by unearthly forces. The narrator then travels (without explanation and perhaps psychically) into a distant future in which humanity has died and then even further, past the death of Earth. Hodgson's ''[[The Night Land]]'' (1912) describes a time, millions of years in the future, when the Sun has gone dark. The last few millions of the human race are gathered together in a gigantic metal pyramid, the Last Redoubt (probably the first [[arcology]] in literature), under siege from unknown forces and Powers outside in the dark.
[[File:Dying_earth.jpg|thumb|right|Cover of the first edition of [[Jack Vance]]'s ''[[The Dying Earth]]'']]
A work by the early French science fiction author [[J.-H. Rosny aîné]], ''[[La Mort de la Terre]]'' (1910), deals with the last, scattered generation of an evolved humankind on an exhausted, desert earth and their encounter with a new type of mineral-metallic life. In some ways it reads like the inversion of his earlier ''[[Les Xipéhuz]]'' (1887), in which early humans encounter and battle an utterly alien and incomprehensible form of life.

From the 1930s onwards, [[Clark Ashton Smith]] wrote a series of stories situated in [[Zothique]], the last continent of Earth. Smith said in a letter to L. Sprague de Camp, dated November 3, 1953:

{{quote|Zothique, vaguely suggested by [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophic]] theories about past and future continents, is the last inhabited continent of earth. The continents of our present cycle have sunken, perhaps several times. Some have remained submerged; others have re-risen, partially, and re-arranged themselves.

The science and machinery of our present civilization have long been forgotten, together with our present religions. But many gods are worshipped; and sorcery and demonism prevail again as in ancient days. Oars and sails alone are used by mariners. There are no fire-arms—only the bows, arrows, swords, javelins, etc. of antiquity.}}

Although not technically set on a dying Earth, many of the [[sword and planet]] stories of the early twentieth century set on [[Mars]]—most notably [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]]'s [[Barsoom]] series and works influenced by it, such as the [[Eric John Stark]] stories of [[Leigh Brackett]] and [[C.L. Moore]]'s series focusing on [[Northwest Smith]]—share similarities with the genre. In these stories, ancient and exotic [[Martian]] (or other) civilizations have undergone a decadent decline, enlivened by the presence of demonic adversaries from past ages. The fact that scientists had seriously speculated that Mars had once borne life, which had by the present almost or, perhaps entirely, died out, gave a special [[entropy|entropic]] kick to these escapist adventures. 

Under the influence of Smith, [[Jack Vance]] wrote the [[short story collection]] ''[[The Dying Earth]]''. The collection would have several sequels. These works gave the subgenre its name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scifi.com/sfw/books/classic/sfw11758.html The Dying Earth | Classic Book Reviews | SCI FI Weekly&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples== 

&lt;!-- Ordered chronologically --&gt;

* [[H. P. Lovecraft]] and [[Robert H. Barlow]] — "[[Till A’the Seas]]" (1935) is a tale of the slow fading of human civilization and the extinction of all life on Earth, as the planet became a desert under the sun that has expanded into a [[red giant]]. The story centers on a male protagonist named Ull, the last of his tribe, and his journey across lands and abandoned cities in hopes of finding water, shelter and other survivors.
*[[John W. Campbell|Don A. Stuart]] —  ''Night'' (1935). Short story. As an unexpected side effect from an experimental [[anti-gravity]] device, a test pilot is sent countless billions of years into the future. The [[Milky Way]] has been reduced to less than a [[light-year]] in diameter, and the dead Earth is [[Tidal locking|tidally locked]] to a much larger and colder red sun. All the gas in the atmosphere, except for neon and helium, is frozen solid. A huge city contains the frozen remains of humans, and the machines humanity had perfected are dead due to the [[superconductivity]] caused by the cold.
* [[Edmond Hamilton]] — ''The City at World's End'' (1951) and the [[comic book]] story "Superman Under the Red Sun" from ''[[Action Comics]]'' #300 (1963).
* [[Arthur C. Clarke]] — ''[[The City and the Stars]]'' (1956), a revision and expansion of the earlier novella "[[Against the Fall of Night]]".
* [[John Brunner (novelist)|John Brunner]] — ''Catch a Falling Star,'' an extended version of ''The 100th Millennium'', first published as "Earth is But a Star" (1958) which features in the Broderick anthology, (2001, below). An early example of a far future tale influenced by Vance.
* [[Brian Aldiss]] — ''[[Hothouse (novel)|Hothouse]]'' (1962, also known as ''The Long Afternoon of Earth''). The earth has [[locked rotation]] with the sun that has increased output, and plants are engaged in a constant frenzy of growth and decay, like a tropical forest enhanced a thousandfold; a few small groups of humans still live, on the edge of extinction, beneath the giant [[banyan tree]] that covers the entire day side of the earth.
*[[Poul Anderson]] — ''Epilogue'' (1962). A novella about a starship from earth on its way to a new solar system, but which due to malfunction returns to its original solar system again three billion years into the future. The sun has become a red giant, and life on earth has been replaced by cybernetic organisms, descendants of human technology.
* [[Lin Carter]] — ''[[Giant of World's End]]'' (1969), and following [[prequel]]s. [[Sword and sorcery]] [[fantasy]] [[novel]]s set on a [[decadent]] far-future Earth in which all the world's [[land]] masses have supposedly [[Continental drift|drifted]] back together to form a last [[supercontinent]] called [[Gondwana|Gondwane]].
* [[M. John Harrison]] — a series of short stories and novels set in [[Viriconium]] from 1971 onwards. Viriconium is the capital city in which much of the action takes place. Viriconium lies on a dying Earth littered with the [[detritus]] of the millennia, seemingly now its own hermetic universe where [[chronology]] no longer applies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infinityplus.co.uk/nonfiction/viriconium.htm M John Harrison: The Centauri Device and Viriconium - an infinity plus double review&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Michael Moorcock]] — [[The Dancers at the End of Time]] series (1972–6).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfsite.com/09b/dan41.htm The SF Site Featured Review: The Dancers at the End of Time]&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Hideyuki Kikuchi -Vampire Hunter D series
* [[C. J. Cherryh]] — ''[[Sunfall]]'' (1977-2004), a collection of short stories set in various locations on Earth in the far future.  The tone, themes and fantasy conventions employed in this collection differ by story. (These were reprinted in ''[[The Collected Short Fiction of C. J. Cherryh]]'').
* [[Doris Piserchia]] — ''Earthchild'' (1977), in which the last human being on Earth faces competition from the world-spanning alien creatures that have devastated the planet.
* [[George R.R. Martin]] — ''[[Dying of the Light]]'' (1977), a novel set on Worlorn, a world whose course is taking it into the far reaches of space, where all life on the planet will die.
* [[Philip Jose Farmer]] — In ''[[Dark Is the Sun]]'' (1979) a tribesman from the distant future quests across the landscape of a dying earth.  As with much of "Dying Earth" science fiction, this text ruminates on the nature of ending, and the meaning of time itself.
* [[Gene Wolfe]] — ''[[The Book of the New Sun]]'' (1981–3) chronicles the journey of a disgraced torturer named [[Severian]] to the highest position in the land. Severian, who claims to have a perfect memory, tells the story in first person. ''The Book'' takes place in the distant future, where the sun has dimmed considerably.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mysite.verizon.net/~vze2tmhh/wolfe.html Lupine Nuncio - Gene Wolfe News and Rumors&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Wolfe has stated that Vance's series directly influenced this work. ''The Book'' has several associated volumes.
* [[Darrell Schweitzer]] — ''[[The Shattered Goddess]]'' (1983), fantasy novel set at the end of man's dominion over Earth, in the interval between the death of the last deity of the former age and the rise of the first of the new. Followed by ''[[Echoes of the Goddess]]'' (2013), a prequel short story collection.
* [[Michael Shea (author)|Michael Shea]] — ''Nifft the Lean'' (1982), a series of sword and sorcery tales set in a far future age where demons and alien entities vie for dominion over the Earth. A later story set in the same universe involved a [[mashup (book)|mash up]] with Vance's Cugel the Clever.
* [[Damien Broderick]], ed. — ''Earth is But a Star: Excursions through Science Fiction to the Far Future'' (2001), an anthology of canonical dying Earth short stories mostly set on Earth in the far future, interwoven with specially commissioned critical essays on the dying Earth theme.
* [[Greg Bear]] — ''[[City at the End of Time]]'' (2008), a novel that is a homage to William Hope Hodgson's ''[[The Night Land]]''.
* [[Jason Aaron]] —  ''The Last Days of Midgard'' (2013), a comicbook miniseries for ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor: God of Thunder]]'' comics in early 2014, where all father Thor, sits at the end of time overseeing both the rebuilding of Old Asgard and a dying planet Earth after humanity killed its ecosystem, the race itself dying off as a result.&lt;ref&gt;''Thor: God of Thunder'' #19-24 (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Rick Remender]] — ''[[Low (comics)|Low]]'' (2014), a comic series set billions of year in the future where [[End of the Sun|the rapid expansion of the sun]] forces humanity to live under water.
* [[Al Ewing]] — ''Time Alone Shall Murder All The Flowers'' (2015), preceding the last days of midgard storyline by Jason Aaron, taking place in the title ''[[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki: Agent of Asgard]]'' where Loki went back to his old ways and pushed humanity into killing their own world and themselves as a consequence. This left him to rule over a planetary graveyard.&lt;ref&gt;''Loki: Agent of Asgard'' #12 (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''European Algae Biomass Association''' ([http://www.eaba-association.eu EABA]), established on June 2, 2009, is the European association representing both [[research]] and [[industry]] in the field of [[Algae#Uses|algae technologies]]

== History ==
EABA was founded during its inaugural conference on June 1-2nd, 2009 at [[Villa La Pietra]] in [[Florence]].

== Objectives ==
The general objective of the European Algae Biomass Association ([http://www.eaba-association.eu EABA]) is to promote mutual interchange and cooperation in the field of [[algae]] production and use, including [[biofuel]]s uses and all other utilisations. It aims at creating, developing and maintaining solidarity and links between its Members and at defending their interests at [[Europe]]an and international level. Its main target is to act as a [[catalyst]] for fostering synergies among [[scientist]]s, [[industrialist]]s and decision makers in order to promote the development of research, [[technology]] and industrial capacities in the field of [[algae]].

In this perspective EABA intends to constitute a basis for:
* Establishing a permanent liaison with [[European Union|EU]] and EU Member States’ Institutions
* Defining and expressing a common position on EU issues ([[legislation]], [[product specification]]s, [[trade]] and [[sustainability]] standards, etc.), acting as a [[technology neutral]] platform
* Representing the European algae industry and scientific community at international level
* Spreading scientific information and knowledge about algae and [[biofuel]]s production
* Making research and industry alive in public debate
* Promoting [[investment]] and [[financial support]] in the field of algae
* Helping the structuring and planning of research and industrial development on algae
* Fostering scientific freedom as well as responsibility
* Studying all economic and technical problems which may impact the sector in the
* European Union and related countries and studying all the direct and indirect environmental, social and economic effects of production and use
* Breaking scientific boundaries on Algae
* Promoting the exchange of scientific information and the publication of sound articles

== Membership and structure ==
EABA’s president, Prof. [[Mario Tredici]], is serving a 2-years term since his election on June 2, 2009. The EABA Vice-presidents are Mr. [[Claudio Rochietta]], (Oxem, Italy), Prof. [[Patrick Sorgeloos]] (University of Ghent, Belgium) and Mr. [[Marc Van Aken]] (SBAE Industries, Belgium). The EABA Executive Director is Mr. [[Raffaello Garofalo]].
The association is headquartered in Florence, [[Italy]].

EABA has 58 founding members and the [http://eaba-association.eu/members.php EABA total membership] reached 79 members in December 2010.

== AquaFUELs ==
[http://www.aquafuels.eu AquaFUELs] is a European research project focusing on establishing the state of the art on research, technological development and demonstration activities using [[algae]] biomass for [[Second generation biofuels|2nd generation biofuels]], assessing the overall [[sustainability]] of algae biofuels.

[http://www.aquafuels.eu AquaFUELs] promotes [[critical thinking]] and reasoning are necessary to draft the lines of future developments in this field, with a view to  understanding the place of algae among [[renewable energy]] sources in the EU, with a careful eye to sustainability and social implications.

[http://www.aquafuels.eu AquaFUELs] aims to draw the detailed, comprehensive and concrete picture of the actual status quo of EU and international initiatives on algae biofuels. Based on this work, AquaFUELs will successively elaborate an overall assessment on the technology, and identify major research and industrial needs.

The surveys and assessments produced by AquaFUELs will address the full [[Life cycle assessment|life cycle analysis]] - from collection to fuel use - in terms of environmental, economic and social sustainability. A major mean to reach project goals will be the coordination of a [[critical mass]] of ongoing research activities, that will be actively involved in the preparation of surveys as well as in the elaboration of the assessment studies and identification of future needs. Creating and maximizing synergies among these initiatives is the major project result.

The project provides support to the establishment of the European Algae Biomass Association, which promotes mutual interchange and cooperation in the field of algae biomass research, production and use.

== Cooperation with other organisations ==
[http://www.eaba-association.eu EABA] is a candidate member of the [[European Renewable Energy Council]]

'''''Extreme Measures''''' is a 1996 American [[crime film|crime]] [[thriller film]] based on [[Michael Palmer (novelist)|Michael Palmer]]'s 1991 novel of the same name, dealing with the ethics of medical sacrifices. The film was directed by [[Michael Apted]] and starred [[Hugh Grant]], [[Gene Hackman]], [[Sarah Jessica Parker]] and [[David Morse (actor)|David Morse]].

==Plot==
Dr. Guy Luthan ([[Hugh Grant]]) is a New York emergency room doctor who one night comes across a strange patient: a homeless man who has a wristband from a hospital he's not familiar with, mentioning a drug he's never heard of, and with strange symptoms, including a wildly fluctuating heart rate. When the man dies, Guy attempts to follow up and find out more about the patient - only to find that the body and all records have disappeared, and he's told by his superiors to drop the case.

As he continues trying to find out what happened, Guy's personal and professional life get suddenly sidetracked. His home is ransacked and cocaine is planted near his bedside. The police arrest him and he is convicted and in the process he loses his job, his license to practice medicine and all of his friends. In desperation, he manages to get the help of some homeless men who lead him to [[mole people|their underground home]]. His ER patient who died also had lived there. Through them he's led to an organization, led by neurosurgeon Dr. Lawrence Myrick ([[Gene Hackman]]), that performs spinal experiments on the homeless people, all of whom have died thus far, in an attempt to find a cure for paralysis.

Myrick attempts to sway Guy to join his team, telling him that his “test subjects” are heroes, and that killing one to save millions is worth the sacrifice.  Guy admits that while there is some truth in what Myrick says, Myrick’s victims did not choose to give up their lives, which makes Myrick a murderer. Myrick is accidentally shot and killed by rogue FBI Agent Frank Hare ([[David Morse (actor)|David Morse]]).  Later, Myrick’s widow hands the discs and documentation regarding the research to Guy telling him "my husband was trying to do a good thing, but in the wrong way".  He opens the package, views the materials and proceeds towards the neurology building where he is now working.

==Production==
The film was based on a 1991 novel by Michael Palmer. It was originally developed as a vehicle for [[Alec Baldwin]].&lt;ref name="new"/&gt;

Then it went to Simian Films, the company of [[Hugh Grant]] and his then-girlfriend [[Elizabeth Hurley]], which had set up at [[Castle Rock Entertainment]]. The film marked a change of pace for Grant, being a drama. "I was always on the lookout for one (a drama), but I wasn't saying, `I've got to do a serious role now.' It was just that that was the best script around."&lt;ref name="new"/&gt;

The script was developed for about a year, including rewrites with involvement from [[William Goldman]]. "We just tamed it a bit for me," said Grant. "We just tweaked it."&lt;ref name="new"/&gt;

Palmer said, "They apologized for the way they deviated from the book. Hugh Grant has turned the protagonist into a character he can live with, but the nature of the character hasn't changed. The more I think about it, the more it seems like my book."&lt;ref&gt;Strickler, J., &amp; Writer, S. (1996, Jul 21). Bottleneck at box office // the hits just keep on coming. Star Tribune Retrieved from https://search.proquest.com/docview/426723651&lt;/ref&gt;

Filming took place in Toronto and New York City, beginning February 1996.

Director [[Michael Apted]] found it challenging working with Grant and Hurley. "It's not something I'd recommend, however genial the people are.... It was tricky. We had the same agendas, mercifully, so it was all right.... Producers are powerful. And actors are powerful these days. So, to have the double whammy up there, it makes your job harder. The other challenge I had was that this was the first film they (Hurley and Grant) produced. They were learning as they were doing.... I didn't know whether they were going to be dilettante producers.... They really got their hands dirty. They weren't just swanning in for the glamour bits. They were there the whole time in the trenches."&lt;ref name="new"&gt;WILLISTEIN, P. (1996, Sep 22). HUGH GRANT, ELIZABETH HURLEY GO TO `EXTREME MEASURES' TO STAY TOGETHER. Morning Call Retrieved from https://search.proquest.com/docview/392830140&lt;/ref&gt;

Added Hurley: "I've been on film sets for about nine years as a hired hand so it wasn't that I didn't know anything.... Yes, there are things I know now that I didn't know before. But there are things a monkey could learn to do.... I think learning to keep on top of things ... You have to, sort of, learn that as you go. I hadn't realized how fragile a film could be. I did end up being very hands-on. I ended up doing much more than I had expected to. I didn't realize how easy it was to really not make the film you set out to make.... I think having to concentrate very, very hard on every department was a shock."&lt;ref name="new"/&gt;

==Reception==
The film had a mixed reception from critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Extreme Measures|publisher= [[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=1996-10-04|url= http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,294427,00.html|accessdate=2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Extreme Measures|publisher= [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=1996-09-15|url= http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117911083?refcatid=31|accessdate=2010-12-13|first=Leonard|last=Klady}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Extreme Measures|publisher= [[Chicago Tribune]]|date=1996-09-27|url= http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1996-09-27/entertainment/9609270125_1_extreme-measures-generic-star|accessdate=2010-12-13|first=Gene|last=Siskel}}&lt;/ref&gt; It currently holds a 56% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. [[Roger Ebert]] and [[Gene Siskel]] both gave the film 3 out of 4 stars. Ebert mentioned in his review that  the film is "pitched at a higher level than most thrillers; the dialogue is literate and intelligent, and Grant is more of an everyman than an action hero."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Extreme Measures|publisher= [[Chicago Sun Times]]|date=|url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19960927/REVIEWS/609270303|accessdate=2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grant's performance received particular praise for this film, along with ''[[An Awfully Big Adventure]]'', for playing against type in his post-[[Four Weddings and a Funeral]] career in the late 1990s. [[Kenneth Turan]], who disliked the film, said of Grant's performance: "Though he doesn't have enough weight to stabilize the film when the plotting turns silly, overall he does a capable job in an unlikely role."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Movie Review; Extreme Measures' Finds Case of Trauma in the E.R.|publisher= [[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=1996-09-27|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1996-09-27/entertainment/ca-47876_1_extreme-measures|accessdate=2010-12-13|first=Kenneth|last=Turan}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Box office===
Despite debuting in second place{{clarify|date=November 2014}}, the film was not a box office success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= 'First Wives' Are Really Enjoying the Last Laugh|publisher= [[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=1996-09-30|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1996-09-30/entertainment/ca-49157_1_wives-club|accessdate=2010-12-13|first=Judy|last=Brennan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4074">'''Femtotechnology''' is a hypothetical term used in reference to structuring of matter on the scale of a [[femtometre|femtometer]], which is 10&lt;sup&gt;−15&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m. This is a smaller scale in comparison with [[nanotechnology]] and [[picotechnology]] which refer to 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m and 10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m respectively.

==Theory==
Work in the femtometer range involves manipulation of excited energy states within [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]], specifically [[nuclear isomer]]s, to produce metastable (or otherwise stabilized) states with unusual properties. In the extreme case, excited states of the individual [[nucleon]]s that make up the atomic nucleus ([[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s) are considered, ostensibly to tailor the behavioral properties of these particles.

The most advanced form of [[molecular nanotechnology]] is often imagined to involve [[Self-replicating machine|self-replicating]] molecular machines, and there have been some speculations suggesting something similar might be possible with analogues of molecules composed of [[nucleons]] rather than atoms. For example, the [[astrophysicist]] [[Frank Drake]] once speculated about the possibility of self-replicating organisms composed of such nuclear molecules living on the surface of a [[neutron star]], a suggestion taken up in the [[science fiction]] novel ''[[Dragon's Egg]]'' by the [[physicist]] [[Robert Forward]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/N/neutronstarlife.html neutron star, life on&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought by physicists that nuclear molecules may be possible,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aip.org/pnu/1991/split/pnu029-2.htm Physics News Update Number 29 - DO NUCLEAR MOLECULES EXIST?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824103842/http://www.aip.org/pnu/1991/split/pnu029-2.htm |date=2007-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldscibooks.com/physics/2318.html Nuclear Molecules&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; but they would be very short-lived, and whether they could actually be made to perform complex tasks such as self-replication, or what type of technology could be used to manipulate them, is unknown.

==Applications==
Practical applications of femtotechnology are currently considered to be unlikely. The spacings between nuclear energy levels require equipment capable of efficiently generating and processing gamma rays, without equipment degradation. The nature of the [[strong interaction]] is such that excited nuclear states tend to be very unstable (unlike the excited electron states in [[Rydberg atom]]s), and there are a finite number of excited states below the nuclear binding energy, unlike the (in principle) infinite number of bound states available to an atom’s electrons. Similarly, what is known about the excited states of individual nucleons seems to indicate that these do not produce behavior that in any way makes nucleons easier to use or manipulate, and indicates instead that these excited states are even less stable and fewer in number than the excited states of atomic nuclei.

'''Francis "Frank" Kenny''' (9 August 1878 – 26 April 1930) was an [[Australian rules football]]er who played with [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]] in the [[Australian Football League|Victorian Football League]] (VFL).

==Career==
Kenny, a South Melbourne junior, made two appearances for St Kilda, in the [[1904 VFL season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Holmesby|first=Russell|last2=Main|first2=Jim|title=The Encyclopedia Of AFL Footballers| publisher=BAS Publishing|year=2007|isbn=9781920910785}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afltables.com/afl/stats/players/F/Frank_Kenny_gm.html|title=AFL Tables – Frank Kenny – Games Played|publisher=AFL Tables|accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He debuted in St Kilda's round 15 loss to [[Melbourne Football Club|Melbourne]] at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afltables.com/afl/stats/games/1904/111519040820.html|title=AFL Tables – Melbourne v St Kilda – Sat, 20-Aug-1904 2:30 PM – Match Stats|publisher=AFL Tables|accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following week he played against [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]] at [[Junction Oval]], in a 61-point loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afltables.com/afl/stats/games/1904/041519040827.html|title=AFL Tables – St Kilda v Collingwood – Sat, 27-Aug-1904 2:30 PM – Match Stats|publisher=AFL Tables|accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also a [[Victorian Premier Cricket|district cricketer]] for [[South Melbourne Cricket Club|South Melbourne]], Kenny played several cricket matches alongside his twin brother Arthur, a Victorian [[first-class cricket]]er.&lt;ref name=Recorder&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article96071274 |title=Death of Former Cricketer. |newspaper=[[The Recorder (Port Pirie)|Recorder (Port Pirie)]] |location=Port Pirie, SA |date=7 August 1934 |accessdate=20 September 2014 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/16/16277/16277.html|title=Arthur Kenny|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that their identical appearances used to confuse opposition players, when one of them came in to bat after another had earlier been dismissed.&lt;ref name=Recorder/&gt;

[[Image:Shimei Futabatei.jpg|thumb|Futabatei Shimei]]

{{nihongo|'''Futabatei Shimei'''|二葉亭 四迷||extra=4 April 1864 – 10 May 1909}} was a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[author]], [[translation|translator]], and literary [[critic]]. Born '''Hasegawa Tatsunosuke''' (長谷川 辰之助) in [[Edo]] (now [[Tokyo]]), Futabatei's works are in the [[Literary realism|realist]] style popular in the mid- to late-19th century. His work ''Ukigumo'' (''[[The Drifting Cloud|Floating Clouds]]'', 1887) is widely hailed as Japan's first modern novel.

==Biography==
After quitting his studies at the [[Russian language]] department at the Tokyo Foreign Language School (東京外国語学校 ''Tōkyō Gaikokugo Gakkō'')&lt;ref&gt;The Tokyo Foreign School was absorbed into the Tokyo Commercial School (東京商業学校 ''Tōkyō Shōgyō Gakkō'') in 1985 before his quit. The status of the Tokyo Commercial School was raised to that of the Higher Commercial School (高等商業学校 ''Kōtō Shōgyō Gakkō'') (now [[Hitotsubashi University]]) in 1887, established affiliated institutions for foreign-language education in 1897, and separated affiliated institutions for foreign-language education as Tokyo School of Foreign Languages (now [[Tokyo University of Foreign Studies]]) in 1899.&lt;/ref&gt; in protest over administrative restructuring, Futabatei published the literary criticism ''Shōsetsu Sōron'' at the encouragement of the critic and author [[Tsubouchi Shōyō]] in 1886.  Futabatei's first novel ''Ukigumo'' was never finished, but its realist style strongly influenced fellow authors in his day.  Futabatei was accomplished in Russian and translated the work of [[Ivan Turgenev]] and other Russian realists into Japanese.

In 1902, he learned [[Esperanto]] in Russia. Returning to Japan in 1906, he published the first Japanese-Esperanto instruction book "世界語" ''Sekaigo''.

Futabatei died of tuberculosis on the [[Bay of Bengal]] while returning from Russia as a special correspondent for the ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'' newspaper.  He was cremated and buried in Singapore.

The origin of his pen name is in the curse his father said when told by his son that he aspired to study literature: ''Kutabatte shimae'' (くたばってしまえ), "Drop dead!".

'''''Gears of War 3''''' is a [[military science fiction]] [[third-person shooter]] [[video game]] developed by [[Epic Games]] and published by [[Microsoft Studios (game studio)|Microsoft Studios]] for the [[Xbox 360]].

Like its predecessors, the game received widespread critical acclaim from critics. Critics praised its story, voice acting, graphics and visuals, and music, but criticized its lack of innovation. ''Gears of War 3'' sold over 3 million copies and was the second best selling game in the U.S.

A sequel, titled ''[[Gears of War 4]]'', was announced in June 2015 and was released on October 11, 2016.

==Gameplay==
Like its predecessors, ''Gears of War 3'' is a [[third-person shooter]] that emphasizes the use of cover and squad tactics in order to survive combat situations. The player's character can carry four weapons: one pistol, one set of grenades, and two primary weapons. Firearms can be swapped with other weapons dropped by fallen foes or at stockpiles throughout the game, along with ammunition. When the player reloads a weapons ammunition, they have an opportunity for an "active reload", shown by a small cursor moving over a line with a marked section on the player's [[heads-up display]] (HUD). If the player hits a control button when the cursor is in the marked section, they will reload faster with the resulting reload being slightly more powerful than normal bullets, causing more damage to opponents as well as allowing for more "knockback" meaning that enemies running directly at you will be slowed on shot. If they press the button outside this section, this temporarily jams the weapon, leaving the player vulnerable and taking longer to reload. Alternatively, the player can opt to not try for the active reload, reloading the weapon at normal speed, but with no added damage.

When in combat, the player can take some damage from enemy fire, filling a blood-colored "crimson omen" on the HUD as a measure of the player's health, unlike the traditional health bar in other shooters. By staying out of the line of fire, this will dissipate over time, but by taking too much damage, the player will become downed or killed, and must be "revived" by an ally within a short "bleed-out" period, or else the player will die, unless playing the game on Insane difficultly in which case a player will die immediately after taking too much damage without the bleed-out. The player can also be killed during the bleed-out by the use of the game's signature execution moves by the enemy. Some types of damage, such as explosives or head shots, can kill the player immediately without the bleed-out period. Similarly, the player can also cause enemies to fall into bleed-out in the same manner. The player and their allies and enemies can use nearly any structure as cover, firing blind from behind it or leaning out to take aimed shots while usually exposing their head more. Players can quickly switch between nearby covering walls or jump over lower cover to rush forward.  Within ''Gears of War 3'', some cover can be destroyed after taking some amount of damage, which can be used to a tactical advantage to draw out enemies from cover.

New to ''Gears of War 3'' is the ability to tag enemy opponents; computer-controlled allies will then concentrate fire on these marked enemies, while human allies will be alerted to their location on their HUD. Players can now also swap weapons and ammunition (and money during Horde Mode) with other allies in the course of battle.

The player maintains an [[experience point|experience level]] that persists across all game modes. The player earns experience through kills, performing special types of kills and executions, reviving and aiding teammates, and through general process of the campaign or competitive modes. Players can also gain experience points by winning medals and ribbons, which are awarded for defeating enemies with certain weapons or winning several matches. Earning levels unlocks the use of special characters and weapon skins within the game's multiplayer mode.

==Synopsis==

===Setting===
[[File:Gears of War 3 campaign screenshot featuring Marcus Fenix and Delta Squad.png|thumb|right|Marcus Fenix and Delta Squad as seen during a four-player campaign co-op mission on board the CNV Sovereign.]]''Gears of War 3'' takes place two years after Jacinto, humanity's last stronghold, is destroyed in an effort to completely eradicate the Locust Horde. The Coalition of Ordered Governments (COG) remnants relocate to Vectes, a secluded island, in order to rebuild their civilization. The COG then disbands after Chairman Prescott mysteriously disappears and seemingly abandons his forces. A new foe, the Lambent, are threatening humanity's dwindling numbers. As the Lambent begin to invade Vectes, [[Marcus Fenix]] and his comrades retreat to the ''CNV Sovereign'', a [[helicopter carrier]], and take refuge at sea.

===Plot===
&lt;!--NOTES FOR EDITORS, PLEASE READ:
*Please do not add in-depth plot summaries, speculation, original research, or trivial details to this section.
*This plot section is not meant to be a full explanation of all events in the game, but rather a short, concise summary of the plot's main events.
--&gt;
''Gears of War 3'' begins as Chairman Prescott unexpectedly arrives on the ''Sovereign''. Prescott informs Marcus Fenix he needs to relay important information to the ship's senior officer, Captain Michaelson. The Lambent then launch a surprise attack on the ship, which leaves Michaelson dead and Prescott mortally wounded. Before dying, Prescott gives Marcus an encryption to the disc that Colonel Hoffman has and reveals that his father, Adam Fenix, is still alive but captive on Azura, a secret COG base. Marcus, Dom, Cole, and Baird fight their way to the Anvil Gate Fortress, where Hoffman possesses the necessary equipment to decrypt Prescott's disc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Gears of War 3|developer=[[Epic Games]]|publisher=[[Microsoft Studios]]|date=20 September 2011|platform=[[Xbox 360]]|version=|scene=|level=|language=|quote='''Baird''': Look. Hoffman's been hanging on to that data disc he stole from Prescott back on Vectes. All those months I've tried figuring out the encryption on it—we ''still'' didn't have a friggin' clue what was on it. Well, ''I'' bet it's the data on Azura, and ''that'' unlocks it. We need to get it to Hoffman and crack that disc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon arriving at Anvil Gate, Marcus and his comrades assist Hoffman's soldiers in repelling a combined Lambent and Locust assault.

Upon further analysis of the disc's content, Marcus learns that Azura is protected by man-made hurricane generators, making the island only accessible by submarine. Marcus and his comrades, joined by old friend Dizzy Wallin, successfully find a submarine but require Imulsion to fuel it. Dom suggests they first venture to an abandoned town called Mercy, where they discover that humans are becoming Lambent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Gears of War 3|developer=[[Epic Games]]|publisher=[[Microsoft Studios]]|date=20 September 2011|platform=[[Xbox 360]]|version=|scene=|level=|quote='''Sam''': She's Lambent!

We gotta stop them [from] getting out. / '''Dizzy''': We gotta get that pipeline runnin' first! I know we're in the shit, but that sub ain't gonna run on piss and moonshine! / '''Marcus''': Yeah, don't worry. We'll do it. ''[…]'' / '''Dom''': My great idea to come here… Sorry, Marcus. / '''Marcus''': It's just as well we did. Now we know the whole human race could turn Lambent if we don't do something about it.}}&lt;/ref&gt; During extraction, the Gears are nearly overrun by Locust and Lambent; Dom sacrifices himself to create an explosion that wipes out the hostile forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Gears of War 3|developer=[[Epic Games]]|publisher=[[Microsoft Studios]]|date=20 September 2011|platform=[[Xbox 360]]|version=|scene=|level=|quote='''Marcus''': Dom, what the f**k're you doing?! / '''Dom''': Pullin' the plug on 'em, Marcus!

''[…]'' / '''Marcus''': ''[seeing the human-shaped ash remains]'' Oh, no. / '''Anya''': ''[shocked]'' Oh, god—they're people! / '''Jace''': Yeah... Kinda creepy.

Let's show what respect we can.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ruined city is inhabited by several Stranded civilians who are led by Griffin (voiced by [[Ice-T]]). Despite his dislike for the COG and Gears, Griffin reluctantly tasks Marcus to recover a supply of Imulsion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Gears of War 3|developer=[[Epic Games]]|publisher=[[Microsoft Studios]]|date=20 September 2011|platform=[[Xbox 360]]|version=|scene=|level=|quote='''Griffin''': So welcome to Griffin Tower, ''COG''.

Ironic, seeing [as how I've] built an empire on it. So [you go] get my fuel back, and I'll let your punk-ass keep some. / '''Marcus''': Well, what's stopping ''you'' from getting it? / '''Griffin''': [Our] refinery across the way's a little late with the fuel shipment.

Now can you manage that, killa?}}&lt;/ref&gt; After acquiring the fuel they are attacked by the Locust Horde, led by Queen Myrrah. Griffin's forces sustain heavy casualties in the ensuing battle, but the Gears are ultimately able to escape and reach the shipyards where they have to fight the Locust as they repair and fuel their submarine.&lt;ref name="Gears of War 3"&gt;{{cite video game|title=Gears of War 3|developer=[[Epic Games]]|publisher=[[Microsoft Studios]]|date=20 September 2011|platform=[[Xbox 360]]|version=|scene=|level=|language=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcus' group finally arrives at Azura, discovering that it is a sanctuary and [[resort]] for Sera's most elite and powerful individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Gears of War 3|developer=[[Epic Games]]|publisher=[[Microsoft Studios]]|date=20 September 2011|platform=[[Xbox 360]]|version=|scene=|level=|language=|quote='''Jace''': So the government shipped people out here?

I need you to get me out so I can deploy the countermeasure. I'm running out of time, Marcus. / '''Marcus''': We'll deal with the grubs, Dad. Hang in there. / '''Adam''': No, I mean the ''Imulsion!'' The Lambent organism! It's about to reach a critical stage in its life cycle. I've got to destroy it before it matures and wipes out all life on Sera! / '''Marcus''': You lost me at "life cycle". / '''Adam''': It's not a fuel, Marcus; it's a living organism. It's turning everything Lambent, including us! / '''Marcus''': ''[realizing]'' It's a parasite. So you ''can'' kill it! / '''Adam''': Yes, that's it, exactly! Myrrah wants me to adapt the countermeasure to kill it ''without'' harming the Locust. But there's no time left for that.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus's group battles through waves of hostiles before finding his father. Adam quickly explains that he has created a device capable of eradicating all Lambent and Locust life forms on Sera. Adam had worked with Myrrah before to try to tune the wave so that only Lambent would be affected, but with the Imulsion, revealed to be a parasitic lifeform, now infecting humans, Adam ran out of time, infuriating Myrrah.&lt;ref name="contact with adam"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Gears of War 3|developer=[[Epic Games]]|publisher=[[Microsoft Studios]]|date=20 September 2011|platform=[[Xbox 360]]|version=|scene=|level=Act 5-5: Ascension|language=|quote='''Adam Fenix''': ''[when Marcus asks him if he feels "sorry" for the Locust]'' Responsible, not sorry. It's ''my'' fault they're here, Marcus. I failed to stop the Imulsion spreading all those years ago. It drove the Locust out of their warrens. I tried to persuade Myrrah to keep her people underground; but they couldn't, so then— / '''Baird''': Wait wait wait. Did I hear right? The government ''knew'' E-Day was coming? And ''none'' of you bothered to warn us?! / '''Adam''': No, just me. Even Prescott didn't know, not until much later. I had so many ''ideas...'' Just...too little time.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus and his comrades defend Adam from the Locust and Lambent, and from an attack by Myrrah. Adam reveals that he had to infect himself with Lambent cells in order to test his machine. As the machine begins to pulsate with energy, Adam bids his son farewell before the device kills him. Myrrah rises from the rubble and begins insulting Adam. Marcus fatally stabs Myrrah with Dom's commando knife he got back in Mercy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Gears of War 3|developer=[[Epic Games]]|publisher=[[Microsoft Studios]]|date=20 September 2011|platform=[[Xbox 360]]|version=|scene=|level=|language=|quote='''Marcus''': Feel that? That's from Dom…and everyone else you killed, you ''bitch!''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards, the machine emits a blue wave of energy that sweeps across Sera, destroying the Locust, Lambent, and the Imulsion. The scene transitions back to Marcus, who is mournfully wondering what humanity has left. He is comforted by Anya, who assures Marcus that the sacrifices of Adam, Dom, and their comrades have guaranteed humanity a future.&lt;ref name="Gears of War 3"/&gt;

Clayton Carmine, brother of Anthony and Benjamin, of the previous two games, appears in ''Gears of War 3''.

He was shown wielding a Mulcher machine gun in several released pictures from the game.

===Unlockables===
Announced via Twitter from [[Cliff Bleszinski]], ''Gears of War 3'' will have unlockables just like ''Gears of War 2''.

* On April 1, 2011, Bleszinski announced as an April Fools' joke via Twitter that ''Gears of War 3'' will have a new unlockable weapon in the form of a 6 barrelled shotgun that has a special ability to shoot nukes. The beta had exclusive unlockables, such as a Golden Retro Lancer by completing 90 matches in any game type, and earning 100 kills with it will unlock it for use in the full game. Players who purchased the ''Bulletstorm'' Epic Edition unlocked an exclusive Flaming Hammerburst for use in the beta and the full game.
* Epic announced that players must hold on to their beta saved file for their unlockables to appear in the full game. It was also confirmed on June 24, 2011 that completing required achievements from ''[[Gears of War]]'' and ''[[Gears of War 2]]'' will earn the player new weapon skins and medals in ''Gears of War 3''.
* The Gold Lancer and Hammerburst have been confirmed as returning from ''Gears of War 2'' to ''Gears of War 3''. [[Rod Fergusson]] announced that players with the Veteran Gear achievement from Gears of War 2 will earn an in-game Old Guard medal and callsign as well as gold variants of all five starting weapons. There was a method to obtain all five gold weapons without the achievement, but after listening to negative fan feed back, they have since made the golden Gnasher shotgun exclusive to Veteran Gear players.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}
* Chrome weapon skins for the five starting weapons have also been confirmed to be unlockable by playing the Xbox 360 or PC version of ''Gears of War'' and ''Gears of War 2''.
* It was confirmed by Rod Fergusson that the player will earn the green liquid metal skin in a special marketing promotion for [[Jack in the Box]].
*People who watch the Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol trailer on [[Xbox Live]] and then complete ''Gears of War 3'' on Insane Difficulty by December 25, 2011 either in single or multiplayer mode will unlock an exclusive Mission: Impossible&amp;nbsp;— Ghost Protocol Weapon Skin Pack. This pack comes with weapon skins for the Lancer, Retro Lancer, Hammerburst, Gnasher and Sawed-off Shotgun. Those that have already completed the game on Insane will automatically receive the pack on December 31.

Upon release, ''Gears of War 3'' received critical acclaim, garnering an aggregate score of 91.49% on [[GameRankings]]&lt;ref name="GR" /&gt; and 91/100 on [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name="MC" /&gt; [[Jeff Gerstmann]] of [[Giant Bomb]] gave ''Gears of War 3'' a review of 5 out of 5 stars;&lt;ref name="Giant Bomb"/&gt; stating "Gears of War 3 is a fantastic follow-up that answers important questions about the nature of the Gears universe while backing it all up with an even bigger, better multiplayer suite." IGN called it "the spectacular conclusion to one of the most memorable and celebrated sagas in video games."&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; ''[[Game Informer]]'' gave it a 9.5/10, saying that "''Gears 3'' is a fantastic idea polished to near perfection by an enormous crew of talented developers and a bottomless budget," with "a constantly shuffling deck of threats that encourage players to experiment with new weapons and tactics," "hilariously over-the-top set piece moments," and a "smart approach to network play."&lt;ref name="Game Informer"/&gt;

His comments were criticized by ''[[Destructoid]]'' and ''[[GamePro]]''. In ''GamePro'', McKinley Noble argued that "slamming a 'bad' review that's actually pretty favorable does come off as selfish".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamepro.com/article/news/223005/editorial-cliffy-b-calls-eurogamer-haters-for-gears-of-war-3-review-score|title=Cliffy B Calls Eurogamer "Haters" For Gears of War 3 Review Score|last=Noble|first=McKinley|date=2011-09-16|accessdate=2011-09-21|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.gamepro.com/article/news/223005/editorial-cliffy-b-calls-eurogamer-haters-for-gears-of-war-3-review-score&amp;date=2011-11-30+19:06:00|archivedate=2011-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vital 5 Productions was a "one-man arts organization" for which Lundgren won a [[List of Stranger Genius Awards winners|Genius Award]] in 2003.&lt;ref name=Hall2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=Graves2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kiley2008/&gt; The program created exhibits, publications and issued grants.&lt;ref name=Manitach2012&gt;{{citation|work=CityArts|title=The Softer Side of Death|date=May 8, 2012|author=Amanda Manitach|url=http://cityartsonline.com/blog/2012/05/softer-side-death}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, it was the subject of an eight-week [[911 Media Arts Center]] retrospective called "Straight to Video: the first 10 years of Vital 5".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Straight to Video|url=http://blog.henryart.org/2007/06/05/straight-to-video/|work=Henry blog|publisher=[[Henry Art Gallery]]|location=Seattle|date=June 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hackett2007/&gt;

Lundgren wrote ''The Vital 5 Cookbook'', published in 2006, as a set of "recipes" for exhibition and self-expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Vital 5 Cookbook|publisher=Vital 5 Productions|url=http://vital5productions.com/projects/v5cookbook.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title may have been a reference to ''[[The Anarchist Cookbook]]''.&lt;ref name=Graves2006/&gt;

Lundgren started Vital 5's Arbitrary Art Grants program in 2009, issuing $500 grants to local artists to "serve as catalysts to create large-scale group projects and performances".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=10 years of Arbitrary Art Grants|date=December 2, 2012|publisher=[[Walden Three]] Seattle|url=http://w3seattle.com/blog/10-years-of-arbitrary-art-grants/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Vital 5 Productions retrofitted the 3rd floor of the historic King Street Station in downtown Seattle for contemporary art exhibition. This 22,000 square foot space hosted Out of Sight - a survey of contemporary art in the Pacific Northwest concurrent with the Seattle Art Fair. Giant Steps - a 48 Hour Artist Residency on the Moon, a group exhibition and competition, opened in the space on March 3, 2016. The second year of Out of Sight will launch on August 4, 2016.

==Lundgren Monuments==
His [[funeral monument]] business, Lundgren Monuments, opened in 2004,&lt;ref name=Eaton2006/&gt; and he opened a "death [[boutique]]" showroom on Seattle's [[First Hill, Seattle, Washington|First Hill]] in 2008 including work by other artists such as [[Jesse Edwards (artist)]] and [[Michael Leavitt (artist)]].&lt;ref name=twist2008/&gt; Lundgren has been noted for "bring[ing] more art and design into the world" of [[Death care industry|death care]],&lt;ref name=FBA2014/&gt; and creating "a renaissance in the funerary arts in 21st-century America."&lt;ref name=Kiley2008/&gt;

Lundgren Monuments specializes in large-scale cast glass monuments with the intent of bringing more color, light and diversity into the cemetery landscape. They also design and build modern urns and host group exhibitions focused on contemporary design and alternatives to traditional death care.

An exhibit at Lundgren Monuments in 2010 was called "the first time in history that a group of architects have focused their talents on the [[cremation urn]] as an architectural object".&lt;ref name=archinect2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=ArchDaily2010/&gt;

An urn/artwork called ''The Final Turn'', which he collaborated with architect [[Tom Kundig]] in designing, was noted in ''[[Robb Report]]'' and ''[[The New York Times]]'', and is shown in [[Cooper-Hewitt]]'s [[National Design Awards]] gallery.&lt;ref name=cooperhewitt/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brooks2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lasky2012/&gt;

==The Order of the Good Death==
Lundgren, along with mortician and author [[Caitlin Doughty]], [[TED (conference)|TED speaker]] Jae Rhim Lee, alternative funeral home director Jeff Jorgenson, and other death professionals, founded [[The Order of the Good Death]], promoting alternative death care and putting Seattle in the forefront of this new endeavor.&lt;ref name=Kiley2014a/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kiley2014b/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Hot topics: Hey funeral directors, move out of the way! | editor=Damon Sayles | work=Funeral Home and Cemetery Executive Briefing|date=December 16, 2014|url=http://www.multibriefs.com/briefs/MV-FuneralEB/MV-FUNERALEB121614.php|accessdate=2014-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Members: Death Professionals|publisher=The Order of the Good Death|url=http://www.orderofthegooddeath.com/members/death-professionals|accessdate=2014-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hannelore Schmatz''' (16 February 1940 &amp;ndash; 2 October 1979) was a German mountaineer. She collapsed and died as she was returning from summiting [[Mount Everest]] via the southern route, the first woman and first German citizen to die on the upper slopes of Everest.&lt;ref&gt;

==Biography==
Schmatz was on an expedition via the South East Ridge route with her husband when she died at 8,300 metres (27,200&amp;nbsp;ft). Gerhard Schmatz was the expedition leader, 50 years of age at the time and the oldest man to summit Everest. On the same expedition was the American [[Ray Genet]], who also died while descending from the summit. Exhausted from the climb, they had stopped to [[bivouac shelter|bivouac]] as the night approached, despite the fact that their [[Sherpa people|Sherpa]] guides had urged them not to. Ray Genet died later that night and both the Sherpa and Schmatz were distressed, but decided to continue their descent. It has been widely reported that at one point Schmatz wanted to rest and she died in her sleep, though this is untrue. At the height of 8,300m Schmatz sat down and said "Water, Water" to her Sherpa and died.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.schmatz-online.com/expeditionen/mt_everest/mt_everest.html&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Sungdare Sherpa]], one of the Sherpa guides remained with her body, and as a result, lost most of his fingers and toes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alpine-club.org.uk/alpineclub/AlpineLeafletFull.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Genet's body ultimately disappeared under the snow, but Schmatz's body was swept further down the mountain.&lt;ref name="Joe1997"&gt;{{cite book | author=Joe Simpson | title=Dark shadows falling | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oxD9X4L4oroC&amp;pg=PA119 | accessdate=7 April 2013 | year=1997 | publisher=The Mountaineers Books | isbn=978-0-89886-549-3 | pages=119–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For years, Schmatz's remains could be seen by anyone attempting to summit Everest by the southern route. Her body was frozen in a sitting position, leaning against her backpack with eyes open and hair blowing in the wind, about 100 metres above [[South Col|Camp IV]].&lt;ref&gt;

In 1984, police inspector Yogendra Bahadur Thapa and [[Sherpa people|Sherpa]] Ang Dorje fell to their deaths while trying to recover Schmatz’s body on a Nepalese police expedition.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Chris Bonington]] spotted Schmatz from a distance in 1985, and initially mistook her body for a tent until he got a closer look.&lt;ref name="Joe1997"/&gt;

[[Lene Gammelgaard]], the first Scandinavian woman to reach the peak of Everest, quotes the Norwegian mountaineer and expedition leader [[Arne Næss, Jr.]] describing his encounter with Schmatz's remains, in her book ''Climbing High: A Woman's Account of Surviving the Everest Tragedy'' (1999), which recounts her own 1996 expedition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|date=1999|url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/773701.Climbing_High|title= Climbing High: A Woman's Account of Surviving the Everest Tragedy|author= Gammelgaard, Lene}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wind eventually blew Schmatz's remains over the edge and down [[Kangshung Face]].&lt;ref name="David1999"&gt;{{cite book | author=David Breashears | title=High exposure: an enduring passion for Everest and unforgiving places | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G28TAQAAIAAJ | accessdate=7 April 2013 | date=1 May 1999 | publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster | isbn=978-0-684-85361-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Helicos Genetic Analysis System''' platform was the first commercial NGS (Next Generation Sequencing) implementation to use the principle of [[single molecule fluorescent sequencing]], a method of identifying the exact sequence of a piece of [[DNA]]. It was marketed by the now defunct [[Helicos Biosciences]].

The fragments of DNA molecules are first [[nucleic acid hybridisation|hybridized]] in place on disposable glass flow cells. Fluorescent [[nucleotides]] are then added one-by-one, with a terminating nucleotide used to pause the process until an image has been captured. From the image, one nucleotide from each DNA sequence can be determined. The fluorescent molecule is then cut away, and the process is repeated until the fragments have been completely sequenced.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson JF, Steinmann KE. 2010  Single Molecule Sequencing with a HeliScope Genetic Analysis System. Curr Protoc Mol Biol. Chapter 7:Unit7.10.&lt;/ref&gt;

This sequencing method and equipment were used to sequence the genome of the [[M13 bacteriophage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harris TD, Buzby PR, Babcock H, Beer E, Bowers J, Braslavsky I, Causey M, Colonell J, Dimeo J, Efcavitch JW, Giladi E, Gill J, Healy J, Jarosz M, Lapen D, Moulton K, Quake SR, Steinmann K, Thayer E, Tyurina A, Ward R, Weiss H, Xie Z | title = Single-molecule DNA sequencing of a viral genome. | journal = Science | volume = 320 | issue = 5872 | pages = 106–9 | date = 4 Apr 2008 | pmid = 18388294 | doi = 10.1126/science.1150427 | bibcode = 2008Sci...320..106H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparing the DNA==
===Fragmenting the DNA===
The Helicos Genetic Analysis System is capable of sequencing nucleic acids, from several nucleotides to several thousand nucleotides. However, the yield of sequences per unit mass is dependent on the number of 3’ end [[hydroxyl groups]], and thus having relatively short templates for sequencing is more efficient than having long templates. Helicos recommends a length less than 1000nt (nucleotides), optimally about 100-200nt. Long fragments can be cleaved by shearing the DNA (the recommended approach), or restriction enzymes. Short fragments are removed to improve yield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Morozova et al |first1=Olena |title=Applications of next-generation sequencing technologies in functional genomics |journal=Genomics |date=2008 |volume=92 |issue=5 |pages=255–264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tailing===
DNA samples are hybridized to a [[Primer (molecular biology)|primer]] immobilized on a flow cell for sequencing, so it is usually necessary to generate a nucleic acid with an end compatible for hybridization to those surfaces. The target sequence attached to the flow cell surface could, in theory, be any sequence which can be synthesized, but, in practice, the standard commercially available flow cell is oligo(dT)50. To be compatible with the oligo(dT)50 primer on the flow cell surface, it is necessary to generate a poly(dA) tail of at least 50 nt at the 3’ end of the molecule to be sequenced. Because the fill and lock step will fill in excess A’s but not excess T’s, it is desirable for the A tail to be at least as long as oligo(dT) on the surface. Generation of a 3’ poly(dA) tail can be accomplished with a variety of different [[ligase]]s or [[polymerase]]s. If there is sufficient DNA to measure both mass and average length, it is possible to determine the proper amount of [[dATP]] to be added to generate poly(dA) tails 90 to 200 nucleotides long. To generate tails of this length, it is first necessary to estimate how many 3’ ends there are in the sample and then use the right ratio of DNA, dATP, and terminal [[transferase]] to obtain the optimal size range of tails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bowers et al |first1=Jayson |title=Virtual terminator nucleotides for next-generation DNA sequencing |journal=Nature Methods |date=2009 |volume=6 |pages=593–595}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blocking===
If the tailed DNA targeted for sequencing is hybridized to the flow cell directly after tailing, it would have a free 3’ hydroxyl that could be extended in the sequencing reaction just like the surface-bound primer and potentially confuse the sequence determination. Thus, prior to sequencing, it is also necessary to block the 3’ ends of the molecules to be sequenced. Any 3’ end treatment that makes the molecule unsuitable for extension can be used. Typically, tailed molecules are blocked using terminal [[transferase]] and a dideoxynucleotide, but any treatment that leaves a 3’ phosphate or other modification that prevents extension can be similarly effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mamanova et al |first1=Lira |title=Target-enrichment strategies for next-generation sequencing |journal=Nat Methods |date=2010 |volume=7 |pages=111–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==DNA sequencing==
===Sample loading===
The single molecule fluorescent sequencing is carried out on a glass flow cell with 25 channels for the same or different samples. The system can be run with either one or two flow cells at a time. In the standard configuration, each channel is equivalent and holds approximately 8 μl. Samples are generally loaded with higher volume (usually 20 μl or more) to ensure even hybridization along the length of the flow cell. Samples are inserted into the flow cell via the sample loader included with the overall system. Each channel is individually addressable, and sample is applied using a vacuum. Hybridization to the flow cell is typically carried out at 55◦C for 1 hr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brady et al |first1=J |title=Optimum cell hybridization conditions in Helicos-based next-generation sequencing |journal=Journal of Biomolecular Technology |date=2011 |volume=24 |issue=5 |pages=211–230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filling and locking===
Generally, samples for sequencing are prepared in such a way that the poly(A) tail is longer than the oligo(dT)50 on the surface of the flow cell. To avoid sequencing the unpaired A residues, a fill and lock treatment is needed. After hybridization, the temperature is lowered to 37◦C, and then d[[Thymidine triphosphate|TTP]] and Virtual Terminator nucleotides &lt;ref&gt;Bowers, J., Mitchell, J., Beer, E., Buzby, P.R., Causey, M., Efcavitch, J.W., Jarosz, M., Krzymanska-Olejnik, E., Kung, L., Lipson, D., Lowman, G.M., Marappan, S., McInerney, P., Platt, A., Roy, A., Siddiqi, S.M., Steinmann, K., and Thompson, J.F. 2009, Virtual terminator nucleotides for next-generation DNA sequencing., Nat. Methods 6:593-595.&lt;/ref&gt; corresponding to dATP, dCTP, and dGTP are added along with DNA [[polymerase]]. Virtual terminator nucleotides incorporate opposite the complementary base and prevent further incorporation because of the chemical structure appended to the nucleotide. Thus, all of the unpaired dAs present in the poly(A) tail are filled in with [[dThymidine triphosphate|TTP]]. The hybridized molecule is locked in place when the [[polymerase]] encounters the first non-A residue and inserts the appropriate virtual terminator nucleotide. Because every DNA molecule should now have a dye attached, an image will include all molecules capable of nucleotide incorporation. Also, because the label could correspond to any base, no sequence information is obtained at this stage. Thus, for most molecules, sequencing commences with the second base of the original molecule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Glenn |first1=T |title=Field guide to next‐generation DNA sequencers |journal=Molecular Ecology Resources |date=2011 |volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=759–769}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sequencing===
; Chemistry cycle
In order to sequence the hybridized DNAs, it is first necessary to cleave off the [[fluorescent]] dye and terminator moieties present on the virtual terminator nucleotides. The current generation of nucleotides is synthesized with a disulfide linkage that can be rapidly and completely cleaved. Following cleavage, the now-separated fluorescent dyes are washed away and then new [[polymerase]] and a single fluorescent [[nucleotide]] are added. After excitation of the fluorescent moiety by the system laser, another image is taken, and, on a standard sequencing run, this cyclic process is repeated 120 times. The number of sequencing cycles is user adjustable and can be modified depending on user needs for run time and length of read. During a standard run, two 25-channel flow cells are used, with each flow cell alternating between the chemistry cycle and the imaging cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Buermans, Dunnen |title=Next generation sequencing technology: advances and applications |journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Molecular Basis of Disease |date=2014 |volume=1842 |issue=10 |pages=1932–1941}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Imaging cycle
During the imaging process, four lasers illuminate 1100 Fields of View (FOV) per channel with pictures taken by four CCD ([[Charge-coupled device]]) cameras via a [[confocal microscope]]. Though single molecules are visualized, multiple photon emissions are registered for each molecule, with the time spent at each FOV dependent on the brightness of the dye in the particular nucleotide as well as camera speed and detection efficiency. At the present time, the imaging process is the rate-determining step, and run time could be reduced at the expense of throughput by reducing the number of FOV per channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Buermans, Dunnen |title=Next generation sequencing technology: advances and applications |journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Molecular Basis of Disease |date=2014 |volume=1842 |issue=10 |pages=1932–1941}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Throughput==
Under optimal conditions, for a standard 120-cycle, 1100 field-of view run, 12,000,000 to 20,000,000 reads that are 25 nucleotides or longer and align to the reference genome should be expected from each channel, for a total of up to 1,000,000,000 aligned reads and 35 Gb of sequence from each run. A full run takes up to 8 days to complete.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

==Advantages and disadvantages==
&lt;!-- List should be replaced by a prose discussion using the words "advantages" and "disadvantages"--&gt;
* The single molecule sequencing strategy simplifies the DNA sample preparation process, avoids [[PCR]]-induced bias and errors, simplifies data analysis and tolerates degraded samples
* Because the process is halted between each extension step, the time to sequence a single nucleotide is high, and the read lengths realized are 32 nucleotides long.
* The error rate is high due to noise. This can be overcome with repetitive sequencing, but increases the cost per base for a given accuracy rate, offsetting some of the gains from lower reagent costs. The raw read error rates are generally at 5%, although the highly parallel nature of this technology can deliver high fold coverage and a consensus or finished read accuracy of 99%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Crosetto et al |title=Nucleotide-resolution DNA double-strand break mapping by next-generation sequencing |journal=Nature Methods |date=2013 |volume=10 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Inu no Osanpo''''' (犬のおさんぽ), (lit. "Walk the Dog") is a [[dog walking]] [[Simulation video game|simulation game]] developed by [[Sega Wow|Wow Entertainment]] and published by [[Sega]] for the [[List of Sega arcade system boards|Sega NAOMI]] [[Arcade system board|arcade system]] in 2001. Players "walk" a virtual dog by walking on a [[treadmill]] and control the pet with a [[leash]] attached to a plastic dog in front of the player.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2002/11/arcade-aerobics/|title=Arcade Aerobics|last=Scuka|first=Daniel|work=WIRED|access-date=2017-07-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was only released in [[Japan]].

== Gameplay ==
''Inu no Osanpo'' simulates the experience of walking a dog. Players first choose one of six breeds of dog to walk: Poodle, Pug, Pembroke Welsh Corgi, Shiba Inu, Labrador Retriever, or Siberian Husky.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2008/04/01/walking-sega%e2%80%99s-virtual-dog/|title=Walking Sega's virtual dog|date=2008-04-01|website=Siliconera|access-date=2017-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difficulty of the game changes depending on the breed of dog chosen. After selecting a dog, the player selects one of three possible walking routes, each with a unique scenario. Route A, intended for beginners, is a walk to the pet store in order to buy dog food. Route B, of intermediate difficulty, is a simulated walk to a field so that the dog can play with a frisbee. Route C, the most difficult path, takes the player through a city on his/her way home from the dog park.

Once a dog and route have been chosen, the walk begins. The goal of Inu no Osanpo is to maintain the dog's happiness long enough to complete the entire route. This is displayed in-game via a "mood meter" and the presence of musical notes around the dog's head.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Players must move the plastic leash-shaped controller to steer their dog away from danger; such as traffic and larger dogs, and towards points of interest such as cats. The player must also avoid garbage and rotten food that is left on the road in order to prevent the dog from eating it and becoming sick.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While the virtual dog is never injured, failure to keep the dog out of danger decreases its mood meter. In addition, players must move at the right pace in order to keep the dog happy. Walking too fast will drag the dog and decrease its mood, but walking too slow will cause it to become angry and tug at the leash. By doing well, the player can unlock a bonus stage where they must follow their dog as it chases a runaway cat.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/02/24/aou-2001-segas-dog-walking-game-disturbs-showgoers|title=AOU 2001: Sega's Dog Walking Game Disturbs Showgoers|last=Staff|first=I. G. N.|date=2001-02-23|website=IGN|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The game ends when the chosen route is completed, or when the dog's mood level decreases to zero. After the game ends, the player's score is calculated and the distance walked, amount of movement, and number of calories burned are displayed. 

== Reception ==
[[IGN]] called the game "odd" and proof that "Sega is absolutely insane".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Iván Balás''' ({{lang-sr|Iván Balaž, Иван Балаж}} {{IPA-sh|ǐʋan balâːʒ|}}; {{lang-hu|Balázs Iván}} {{IPA-hu|ˈbɒlaːʒ ˈivaːn|}}; 1894 &amp;ndash; 1971) was a [[Yugoslavs|Yugoslav]] tennis player of [[Hungary|Hungarian]] ethnicity. He was the one of the first to play for the [[Yugoslavia Davis Cup team|Yugoslavian team]] at the [[International Lawn Tennis Challenge]], and later the [[Davis Cup]] in 1927. Technically his match was the second rubber of the tie. Apart from team competitions, he clinched international championships for Yugoslavia, Hungary, Austria, Romania and Slovakia in various events.{{sfn|Šoškić|2012|pp=251-252}}

==Early life and family==
Iván Balás was born in 1894 in [[Elemir]], [[Bečkerek]] (renamed Zrenjanin in 1946), [[Banat]], then part of [[Austria-Hungary]] and now [[Serbia]]. He was born into a wealthy landowner family of ethnic Hungarians, the son of Iván Balás, Sr. (1866, [[Tápióbicske]] – 1909, [[Budapest]] and Erna Koronghy (1874, [[Satchinez|Baracháza]] – 1850, Budapest).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BALÁS Iván, sipeki|url=http://www.macse.org/gudenus/mcsat/fam.aspx?id=16610|publisher=Magyar Családtörténeti Adattár|accessdate=10 August 2017|language=hu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hs family's wealth contributed to his rapid growth in tennis. His Hungarian father ), built two tennis courts in Elemir where his son Iván learned tennis. Iván attended the [[Nagybecskerek]] high school.&lt;ref name="magyarszo"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=László|first1=Táborosi|title=Balázs Iván és Nagy István|journal=Hungarians of Vojvodina in the Olympic Team of SZHSZ and Royal Yugoslavia 1924-1936|url=https://www.magyarszo.rs/hu/3010/sport/143721/Bal%C3%A1zs-Iv%C3%A1n-%C3%A9s-Nagy-Istv%C3%A1n.htm|accessdate=10 August 2017|language=hu}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued his studies in Budapest.{{sfn|Šoškić|2012|pp=251-252}}

==Tennis career==
In college Balás played tennis as well as basketball, hockey, football and athletics.{{sfn|Šoškić|2012|pp=251-252}} He began to win club and international tournaments in [[Nagybecskerek]].{{sfn|Šoškić|2012|pp=251-252}} Balás' first public triumph was recorded in 1922 in the men's singles of the National Championship in [[Novi Sad]].

At the [[Tennis at the 1924 Summer Olympics|1924 Olympics]] in Paris, he played both singles in doubles. In the men's singles, he was defeated in the [[Tennis at the 1924 Summer Olympics – Men's singles|first round]] by [[Jack Nielsen (tennis)|Jack Nielsen]] (Norway). And in doubles, he and [[Đorđe Dunđerski]] advanced to the [[Tennis at the 1924 Summer Olympics – Men's doubles|second round]]&lt;!-- apparently the first-round results were not recorded --&gt;but lost to [[Jacques Brugnon]]/[[Henri Cochet]] (France).&lt;ref name="magyarszo"/&gt;

In 1926, he was crowned the champion of Yugoslavia. He was drafted into the [[Yugoslavia Davis Cup team|Kingdom of Yugoslavia Davis Cup team]] for the first-ever [[Davis Cup]] match against India in [[Zagreb]] in May 1927, joined by [[Đorđe Dunđerski]].{{sfn|Šoškić|2012|pp=251}} Although they didn't win a game or set, both of them provided strong resistance. Balás even had two balls to have a chance to serve out the first set in the match against [[Hassan-Ali Fyzee]], but did not succeed, as the Indian player came back to claim the match. On the third ball, the game was suspended due to bad weather, and so the match was decided after the first two days' results. The organizers agreed not to wait on Monday but to pass the remaining two [[dead rubber]]s and the victory to India.{{sfn|Šoškić|2012|pp=251-252}}

Balás next represented Hungary, debuting in a match against [[Austria Davis Cup team|Austria]].{{sfn|Tennisz és Golf II/12, pp.215-217}} At the time he was fifth/sixth on the Hungarian rankings.{{sfn|Tennisz és Golf II/12, pp.215-217}} In 1930 he earned the second place in mixed doubles at the Bucharest International Championship (lost to [[Ghica Poulief]] and [[Nini Golescu]]){{sfn|Tennisz és Golf II/12, pp.215-217}} In [[Cluj-Napoca]] he lifted the doubles trophy with partner [[Béla Kehrling]], defeating Romanian champion [[Constantin Cantacuzino (aviator)|Constantin Cantacuzino]] and [[Alexandru Botez]]; he also finished third in singles and mixed contest.{{sfn|Tennisz és Golf II/15, p.295}} In 1931 he reached four doubles finals, including the Hungarian Covered Courts tournament mixed and men's doubles, and the Warsaw International Championships doubles and mixed doubles.{{sfn|Tennisz és Golf III/5-6, pp.74-75}}{{sfn|Tennisz és Golf III/11–12, pp. 201-202}}

==Personal life==
In 1928, Balás was engaged in Hungary, and he was no longer in the Davis Cup team of Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Šoškić|2012|pp=251-252}} He mostly played and practised in Budapest and joined the [[Magyar Atlétikai Club]].{{sfn|Tennisz és Golf II/12, pp.215-217}} In 1944 he moved to Austria, where he continued his tennis career and got married to Zita Kremmel in 1950. On April, 11th 1951 their daughter Charlotte was born. As of 1951 he lived and worked in France, where he was a devoted tennis player and coach for the rest of his life.

Balás died in Paris in 1971. The tennis club ''Galeb'' in [[Zrenjanin]] organizes a traditional tournament each year that bears his name.{{sfn|Šoškić|2012|pp=251-252}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3136">'''James Joseph Corbett''' (November 10, 1919 &amp;ndash; January 29, 1967) was an American sports administrator who served as [[athletics director]] at [[LSU Tigers|Louisiana State University]] from 1954 until his death in 1967.  

==Biography==

Corbett was born in [[Woburn, Massachusetts]] and attended high school in nearby [[Arlington, Massachusetts|Arlington]]. He graduated from [[Southeastern Louisiana College]] in 1944.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt;

In addition to his role at LSU, Corbett also served as the first president of the [[National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics]] from 1965–1966,&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;{{cite news |title=LSU Athletic Head Jim Corbett Dead |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/213903957/?terms=Jim%2BCorbett |work=[[The Times (Shreveport)|The Shreveport Times]]|accessdate=August 2, 2018 |date=January 30, 1967 |location=Shreveport, Louisiana |page=1|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for more than 10 years was a member of the [[Sugar Bowl]] Executive Committee.&lt;ref name="award"&gt;{{cite news |title=Sugar Bowl Gives Award for Corbett |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/212966254/?terms=Corbett%2BAward |accessdate=August 2, 2018 |work=[[The Times (Shreveport)|The Shreveport Times]] |date=April 18, 1967 |location=Shreveport, Louisiana |page=19|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died of a massive heart attack in [[New Orleans]], aged only 47. LSU President John A. Hunter said, "Not only is it a tragedy as far as LSU is concerned, but it is a tragic personal loss because we all loved him so much. I think he ran one of the most efficient athletic departments in the United States and we never had an employee more dedicated to LSU than Jim was."&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt;

==Legacy==
The National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics (NACDA) established the [[Corbett Award]], which is presented annually "to the collegiate administrator who through the years has most typified Corbett's devotion to intercollegiate athletics and worked unceasingly for its betterment." The first recipient was [[Bernie Moore]], commissioner emeritus for the [[Southeastern Conference]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Athletic Directors Meet in Minneapolis |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/82200040/?terms=Corbett%2BAward |accessdate=August 2, 2018 |work=The La Crosse Tribune |date=June 15, 1967 |location=La Crosse, Wisconsin |page=16|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three months after Corbett's death, the Sugar Bowl Executive Committee established a memorial award in his name. It honored the most outstanding male or female collegiate athlete of the year in Louisiana, as selected by a panel of Louisiana's sports journalists.&lt;ref name="award"/&gt;

==Professional years==
During the 1950s and '60s, Cunningham went to [[New Zealand]], [[India]] and [[Antarctica]]. He wanted to climb to [[Mt. Everest]], and in 1953 he had gone to [[Nepal]] via India with Dr. [[Hamish MacInnes]], also a Scottish mountaineer, to start his climb. However, [[Edmund Hillary|Hillary]] and [[Tenzing Norgay|Tenzing]] had made it to the top of Mount Everest before he could begin.&lt;ref name=Hard/&gt;

He then started his career with the British Antarctic Survey. He was the base leader at Adelaide Island. In the 1970s, after he returned to Scotland, he became an instructor at the Glenmore Lodge near Aviemore. In this capacity he perfected innovations in techniques for front point [[Crampons|cramponing]] and use of [[Ice axe|curved pick ice axes]] on steep sloping ice.&lt;ref name=Hard/&gt; He had used this front point technique while working in Antarctica on icebergs and cliffs with a slope of 70 to 90 degrees.&lt;ref name="docs.google.com"/&gt; In 1976 he became an instructor at [[I M Marsh Campus]] in Liverpool.&lt;ref name=Hard/&gt; In 1980, he took his students for practical instruction on climbing to the [[South Stack]] cliffs on [[Anglesey]]. Here he drowned on 31 January 1980 after being swept into the sea, as he did not know how to swim. His students survived.&lt;ref name=Hard/&gt;

==Honors==
Cunningham is the namesake of [[Mount Cunningham]] ({{Convert|1220|m}}) in the [[Queen Maud Bay]] at the southern end of [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]],&lt;ref name="Hattersley-Smith1988"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hard/&gt; His biography, titled ''Creagh Dhu Climber, the life and times of John Cunningham'', was published by Ernest Press.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Connor |first=John |year=1999 |title=Creagh Dhu Climber, the life and times of John Cunningham |publisher=Ernest Press |isbn=978-0-948153-54-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mountainsmounts.com/mountain/50233/mount-cunningham/ |title=Mount Cunningham |work=Mountains mounts |accessdate=13 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kole Nedelkovski''' ([[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and {{lang-mk|Коле Неделковски}}) was a [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonian]] revolutionary and poet,&lt;ref name="yu"&gt;[https://books.google.mk/books?id=ORSMBFwjAKcC&amp;pg=PA146&amp;dq=Kole+Nedelkovski&amp;hl=mk&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2zAqUfHuAYTYsgbksoH4Ag&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Kole%20Nedelkovski&amp;f=false The Former Yugoslavia's Diverse Peoples: A Reference Sourcebook], Matjaž Klemenčič, Mitja Žagar, p 146&lt;/ref&gt;  and member of the [[Bulgarian Communist Party]]. He was a member of the [[Macedonian Literary Circle]] and he published two poetry books. Today, Nedelkovski is seen as one of the founders of the modern Macedonian poetry.&lt;ref name="bechev"&gt;[https://books.google.mk/books?id=1jSg3lxgSy8C&amp;pg=PA160&amp;dq=Kole+Nedelkovski&amp;hl=mk&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TTIqUYD0F8zktQb7s4G4AQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Kole%20Nedelkovski&amp;f=false Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Macedonia], D. Bechev, p.160.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
He was born in [[Čaška Municipality|Vojnica]], near [[Veles (city)|Veles]], Ottoman Empire as ''Nikola Kr(a)stev Nedelkov''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.promacedonia.org/pg/pg_1.html Македонски литературен кръжок (1938–1941 г.) доц. д-р Петър Галчин, първа част, сп. Македонски Преглед, София, бр. 1, 2002 г.]&lt;/ref&gt; Hunted from the Serbian police he emigrated to Bulgaria in 1933. In Sofia, Nedelkovski joined the ''[[Macedonian Literary Circle]]''.&lt;ref name="bechev"/&gt; Besides Nedelkovski, the most active members of the Circle were [[Dimitar Mitrev]], [[Gjorgji Abadžiev]], [[Venko Markovski]], [[Nikola Vapcarov]] and others. Later, he became a member of the [[Bulgarian Communist Party]]. He ended his life escaping the police in Sofia in 1941, by jumping from an attic window, or by another version, was thrown out of the window.

==Works==
His poem [[Skopje-Veles dialect#Examples of the Skopje-Veles dialect|"A Voice from Macedonia"]] (''Glas od Makedonij''a) is one of the most famous revolutionary poems in the [[Macedonian literature]]. His [[poetry]] describes the difficult life of the Macedonian people prior to [[World War II]] and glorifies the communist ideas and fight against [[capitalism]]. Nedelkovski's poems were published in [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], more precisely on [[Skopje-Veles dialect]]. The differences between Standard Macedonian and Skopje-Veles dialect are minor.

Nedelkovski published two poetry books:&lt;ref&gt;[http://brif.mk/rakurs/100-%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B8-%D0%BE%D0%B4-%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%93%D0%B0%D1%9A%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BE-%D0%BD%D0%B0-%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%82-%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B5-%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%B4/ 100 години од раѓањето на поетот Коле Неделковски] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121116044259/http://brif.mk/rakurs/100-%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B8-%D0%BE%D0%B4-%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%93%D0%B0%D1%9A%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BE-%D0%BD%D0%B0-%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%82-%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B5-%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%B4/ |date=2012-11-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lady Octopus''' (real name '''Carolyn Trainer''' and also known as '''[[Doctor Octopus]] II''') is a [[supervillain]]ess in [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is depicted as a protégée to her predecessor of the name and primarily an enemy to [[Spider-Man]] and [[Scarlet Spider]] ([[Ben Reilly]]).

==Publication history==
Lady Octopus first appearance was in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #406 (October 1995) and was created by [[J. M. DeMatteis|J.M. DeMatteis]] and [[Angel Medina (artist)|Angel Medina]].

==Fictional character biography==
Carolyn Trainer is the daughter of Seward Trainer who was a student of [[Doctor Octopus]]. After Doctor Octopus was killed by [[Kaine Parker|Kaine]] during the [[Clone Saga]], Carolyn replaced the teacher she adored.&lt;ref&gt;''Spider-Man Unlimited'' #18&lt;/ref&gt;

She obtained a set of four tentacles identical to Octavius's and made use of a personal force-field that kept anything from hitting her. However, her tentacles could lash out from the shield at any time during its use. She took the "Doctor Octopus" name in honor of her beloved instructor and began a campaign to steal her father's research in merging reality and virtual reality.&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man'' #405&lt;/ref&gt;

When she found her father was being protected by [[Ben Reilly|Scarlet Spider]], she became jealous of the father-son relationship between him and her father. She tried but failed to blackmail her way into gaining Trainer's data by stealing a serum that could cure a seriously ill [[Mary Jane Watson]], resulting in her being beaten heavily by Spider-Man and revealing she was working for the mysterious [[Doctor Octopus|Master Programmer]].&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man'' #406&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Spider-Man'' #62–63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Spectaculer Spider-Man'' #229&lt;/ref&gt;

Carolyn continued her efforts to merge reality and virtual reality, ending up in a technological gang war against Mr. Tso and his boss [[Alistair Smythe]] with the Scarlet Spider in the middle of it. She hired the Looter, Override and Aura, and the Pro to assist her in this, as well as Stunner (Octavius's lover), and eventually succeeded in defeating Smythe and gaining the technology she needed before the Scarlet Spider thwarted her.&lt;ref&gt;''Web of Scarlet Spider'' #1–2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Scarlet Spider'' #1–2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Scarlet Spider'' #1–2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Spectacular Scarlet Spider'' #1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

The Master Programmer was revealed to be a digitized copy of Doctor Octopus' mind and Carolyn's overall plan had been to allow Master Programmer to exist in the real world, effectively resurrecting the original Doctor Octopus. This thwarted, she attempted to claim her father's then-comatose body and was finally captured by the police.&lt;ref&gt;''Spectaculer Spider-Man'' #232&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, she was involved in the resurrection of Doctor Octopus. The cult group known as [[The Hand (comics)|The Hand]], working for [[Richard Fisk|the Rose]], dug up Octavius' corpse and brought him back from the dead, albeit with large mental gaps. Carolyn injected him with all the data of the Master Programmer and returned the tentacles to him. She joined him as an assistant and faded into the background.&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man'' #425–428&lt;/ref&gt;

Lady Octopus made a small appearance in ''[[Secret War (comics)|Secret War]]'' as Lady Octopus to distinguish her from her mentor. She was given a new suit of armor by [[Lucia von Bardas]] and [[Tinkerer]]. She and [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin V]] were sent to assassinate [[Captain America]], but were defeated. They regrouped to a dock where a small army of Tinkerer's clients where waiting (consisting of [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]], [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]], [[Crimson Dynamo]] IX, [[Crossfire (comics)|Crossfire]], [[Eel (comics)|Eel II]], [[Goldbug (comics)|Goldbug]], [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]], [[Cobra (Marvel Comics)|King Cobra]], [[Mentallo]], [[Scorcher (comics)|Scorcher]], [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]], [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]], [[Spider-Slayer|Spider-Slayer XIX]], [[Trapster]] and [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]]).&lt;ref&gt;''Secret War'' #3&lt;/ref&gt; Lady Octopus fought [[Spider-Man]] and Captain America when the [[Fantastic Four]] join the battle. Just then, Lucia von Bardas activated the devices in the villains' suits linking them together to a giant bomb.&lt;ref&gt;''Secret War'' #4&lt;/ref&gt; After Daisy Johnson deactivated von Bardas, Lady Octopus and the other villains Lucia von Bardas manipulated were all hospitalized with severe injuries.&lt;ref&gt;''Secret War'' #5&lt;/ref&gt;

Lady Octopus has been hired by Walter Declun (a former member of [[Damage Control (comics)|Damage Control]]) to assist [[Absorbing Man]], [[Hydro-Man]], [[Killer Shrike]], a [[Mandroid]], [[Porcupine (comics)|Porcupine]] II, and Rock to defend him from Black Panther and the Fantastic Four after they uncovered his plot to destabilize all of Wakanda on [[Doctor Doom]]'s behalf. Walter Declun also upgraded their technological equipment in order to perform the job.&lt;ref&gt;''Black Panther'' vol. 5 #11&lt;/ref&gt;

Lady Octopus was later seen shortly before the [[Siege (comics)|Siege of Asgard]] when she went on a rampage in New York only to be defeated by [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]] and [[Hawkeye (comics)|Ronin]].&lt;ref&gt;''New Avengers'' #63&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
[[Image:Octopusforcefield.png|145px|thumbnail|left|A demonstration of Lady Octopus's personal force-field.]]
Lady Octopus has no superhuman abilities. The harness she uses can act as an extension of her own body, and can lift far more than her human body, provided she braces herself appropriately with other tentacles. The reaction time of these "tentacles" is superhumanly fast. The tentacles also enable her to traverse very difficult terrain and cover ground at car-like speeds. The tentacles are also armed with lasers.

Through the tentacles, Lady Octopus seems able to interface with appropriately equipped computer systems and enter virtual-reality interfaces telepathically.

The force field the harness projected over her body was resistant to most traumatic concussive force and conventional weapons attack. The weak point of the force field is around the tentacles themselves, something Scarlet Spider took advantage of with his impact webbing.

Aside from her harness, Lady Octopus was highly learned in the science of robotics, information technology, applied physics, and mechanical engineering.

==Other versions==

===MC2===
A version of her in the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate future]] series ''Spider-Girl'' returned to supervillainy years after Otto Octavius's death, initially reclaiming the 'Doctor Octopus' title. Intending to create mutate soldiers for the mob, Carolyn Trainer briefly turned [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]] back into Man-Wolf, before beating [[Spider-Girl]] in a pitched battle. Later, she freed crime boss Canis from prison in the hope of uniting to take over the criminal underworld and oppose the [[Black Tarantula]]; it turned out she was in fact working for the Tarantula, setting Canis up for a fall. Spider-Girl battled her once again and finally took her down.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

==In other media==
===Television===
Lady Octopus appears in the ''[[Spider-Man (2017 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' episode "Between an Ock and a Hard Place," voiced by [[Kari Wahlgren]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Between an Ock and a Hard Place|series=Spider-Man|network=Disney XD|season=2|number=28|airdate=June 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version has a Ph.D in electronics and hacked the computers so that she would fake her criminal record and be in the cell next to Doctor Octopus in the Cellar. Doctor Octopus manipulated Carolyn in her alias of Lady Octopus into obtaining some crystals for his modified version of Neuro Cortex to enhance his mind and she gave Spider-Man a hard time with her Octobots. After Spider-Man webbed her down in a seafood restaurant next to a hardware store, Lady Octopus caught up to Spider-Man where she heard that Doctor Octopus used her and goes on the attack. With [[Spider-Man (Miles Morales)|Miles Morales]], [[Gwen Stacy]], and [[Anya Corazon]] starting to fight back mentally, Spider-Man works with Lady Octopus to fight Doctor Octopus physically. With the resulting fight placing Doctor Octopus in a coma, Spider-Man admits that Lady Octopus made a terrible supervillain as the police start to arrive at Horizon High. After being told by Spider-Man not to blow her second chance like Doctor Octopus did, Carolyn discards her tentacle harness.

===Video games===
* Lady Octopus appears in a teaser image for Season Two of ''[[Marvel: Avengers Alliance]]'' where it parodies the cover of ''X-Men'' #141 (the opening issue of the ''[[Days of Future Past]]'' storyline).&lt;ref&gt;"[http://marvel.com/news/story/20741/get_set_for_avengers_alliance_season_2 Get Set for Avengers Alliance Season 2]," Marvel&lt;/ref&gt; In Chapter 9 as part of the fifth mission, Lady Octopus is found dead alongside [[Armless Tiger Man]] and [[Shockwave (comics)|Shockwave]] where the three of them end up victims of the Circle of Eight.

Serena creates a battle suit with six high-tech mechanical arms and gives herself the "Doctor Octopus" title after her idol Dr. Otto Octavius. Patel also uses her genius to create a new [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]] with Alchemax's technology and manipulate the [[Scorpion (Marvel Comics)|Scorpion]] ([[List of Marvel Comics characters: S#Kron Stone|Kron Stone]]) into helping her. After Hobgoblin and Scorpion are defeated, Doctor Octopus finds a fragment of the Tablet of Order and Chaos and goes mad with power. She then builds a Condensed Matter Reactor powered by the fragment to wreak havoc and take over the world. Found by [[Spider-Man 2099|Spider-Man]], she attacks Spider-Man and escapes upon setting off the self-destruct sequence. Spider-Man escapes the explosion and finds Patel at the Condensed Matter Reactor. Doctor Octopus ends up unleashing some strange creatures wielding a copy of her tentacles on Spider-Man as he moves about to shut down the 4 reactor cores. After shutting down the reactor cores, Spider-Man confronts Serena in the reactor. Patel is eventually defeated by Spider-Man, claiming the tablet fragment from her. In the credits, she is shown with her mask off raising infant versions of Hobgoblin and Scorpion.

'''Latrell Fontaine Sprewell''' (born September 8, 1970) is an American former professional [[basketball]] player; he played for the [[Golden State Warriors]], the [[New York Knicks]],  and the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]]. During his time as a professional, Sprewell was named to the yearly [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] All-Star game four times; he also helped the Knicks reach the [[NBA Finals]] and the Timberwolves the [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]] finals. Despite his accomplishments, his career was overshadowed by a 1997 incident in which he choked coach [[P. J. Carlesimo]] during a practice, which ultimately resulted in a 68-game suspension.

Sprewell's career came to an unexpected end in 2005 when he refused a $21-million three-year contract offer from the Timberwolves, which Sprewell implied would not be enough to feed his children. The Timberwolves offered him nothing more. Since that time, he has made headlines for grounding his million-dollar yacht and subsequently having it repossessed for missed payments, having two of his homes foreclosed upon, and being prohibited from seeing his children.&lt;ref name="Ostler"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/archive/2007/08/23/SPGT3RNR151.DTL | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | first=Scott | last=Ostler | title=Captain Spree should remain a landlubber | date=August 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==NBA career==

===Golden State Warriors===
After attending [[Washington High School (Milwaukee, Wisconsin)|Washington High School]] in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], Sprewell played competitively with the [[Three Rivers Community College (Missouri)|Three Rivers Community College]] Raiders Basketball Team in [[Poplar Bluff, Missouri]] from 1988&amp;ndash;1990, and from 1990&amp;ndash;1992 with the [[University of Alabama]], where he was a teammate of future NBA players [[Robert Horry]], [[Jason Caffey]] and [[James Robinson (basketball)|James Robinson]].

He was selected 24th overall in the [[1992 NBA draft]] by the [[1992–93 Golden State Warriors season|Golden State Warriors]]. Sprewell, nicknamed "Spree", made an immediate impact, starting 69 of the 77 games he played in during his rookie season and averaging 15.4 points per game. His performance would improve over the next few years, leading the team in scoring and playing for the Western Conference All-Star team in 1994, 1995, and 1997, scoring 24.2 ppg in 1996–97, fifth in the league. Additionally, in 1993–1994 he led the league in games played and minutes per game as the Warriors, led by Sprewell and NBA Rookie of the year [[power forward (basketball)|power forward]] [[Chris Webber]], made it back to the [[1994 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]]. They would, however, lose in the first round to the [[1993–94 Phoenix Suns season|Phoenix Suns]] in three games.

====1997 choking incident====
Though a four-time All-Star, a significant blemish on Sprewell's career was an incident that took place on December 1, 1997, when he attacked head coach [[P. J. Carlesimo]] during a Warriors practice. When Carlesimo yelled at Sprewell to make crisper passes (specifically asking him to "put a little mustard" on a pass),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Report: Sonics set to make Spurs assistant Carlesimo coach |url=http://www.sportsline.com/nba/story/10245270 |work=[[CBSSports.com]] |date=July 3, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212024621/http://www.sportsline.com/nba/story/10245270 |archivedate=December 12, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sprewell responded that he was not in the mood for criticism and told the coach to keep his distance. When Carlesimo approached, Sprewell threatened to kill him and dragged him backwards by his throat, choking him for 7–10 seconds before his teammates and assistant coaches pulled Sprewell off his coach. Sprewell returned about 20 minutes later after showering and changing and again accosted Carlesimo. He landed a glancing blow at Carlesimo's right cheek before being dragged away again by the assistant coaches.  It was not his first violent incident with the Warriors; in 1995, Sprewell fought with teammate [[Jerome Kersey]] and returned to practice carrying a [[dimensional lumber|two-by-four]], and reportedly threatened to return with a gun.&lt;ref name="espn"/&gt; In a 1993 practice, Sprewell fought with [[Byron Houston]], who was 50 pounds heavier than Sprewell and had what many teammates describe as having a Mike Tyson-like demeanor and physique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1011658/2/index.htm | work=CNN | title=Video | date=December 15, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sprewell was suspended for 10 games without pay. However, the next day, in the wake of a public uproar, the Warriors voided the remainder of his contract altogether, which included $23.7 million over three years, and the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] suspended him for one year. Sprewell took the case to [[arbitration]] and the contract voiding was overturned, but the league did suspend him for the rest of the season without pay, which amounted to 68 games. He sought to vacate the arbitration contract under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement. His case went through all appeals, and was remanded. During the time he was serving his suspension from the NBA, Sprewell was charged with [[reckless driving]] for his role in a 90-mile-per-hour accident that injured two people. He spent three months under house arrest as part of a no-contest plea.&lt;ref name="espn"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;AP, March 18, 1998; AP, July 28, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

===New York Knicks===
Due to the [[1998–99 NBA season|NBA lockout]], Sprewell did not play again until February 1999,&lt;ref&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/courant/access/38835785.html?dids=38835785:38835785&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Feb+06%2C+1999&amp;author=Associated+Press&amp;pub=Hartford+Courant&amp;desc=SPREWELL+CAN'T+SAVE+KNICKS+MAGIC+WIN+OPENER%3B+CAMBY%3A+10+SECONDS&amp;pqatl=google "Sprewell can't save Knicks"]. [[Associated Press]]. February 6, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; after the Warriors traded him to the [[1998–99 New York Knicks season|New York Knicks]] for [[John Starks (basketball)|John Starks]], [[Chris Mills (basketball)|Chris Mills]] and [[Terry Cummings]].  Sprewell played 37 games for the Knicks that season, playing off the bench in all but four games.

Many pundits felt that signing the volatile Sprewell was too big a gamble for the Knicks to take, but Sprewell himself vowed he was a changed man. The Knicks, who at the time still revolved around veteran All-Star [[center (basketball)|center]] [[Patrick Ewing]], narrowly qualified for the [[1999 NBA Playoffs|1999 playoffs]], making the field as the eighth seed in the Eastern Conference. The Knicks navigated past the [[1998–99 Miami Heat season|Miami Heat]], [[1998–99 Atlanta Hawks season|Atlanta Hawks]] and finally the [[1998–99 Indiana Pacers season|Indiana Pacers]], making it as the first eighth seed in NBA history to the [[1999 NBA Finals]], where they met the [[1998–99 San Antonio Spurs season|San Antonio Spurs]], who beat them in five games although Sprewell enjoyed a good series for the most part, averaging 26.0 ppg. He tallied 35 points and grabbed 10 rebounds in the Knicks' 78-77 Game 5 loss, and was subsequently featured on the cover of the September 1999 issue of ''[[SLAM Magazine]]''.

Sprewell moved into the Knicks' starting lineup for the [[1999–2000 NBA season|1999–2000 season]] at small forward, and averaged 18.6 points, helping the Knicks to a 50-32 record good enough for the third seed in the Eastern Conference led by Sprewell, Ewing and [[shooting guard]] [[Allan Houston]].  The Knicks navigated past the [[1999–2000 Toronto Raptors season|Toronto Raptors]] in three hard-fought games and the [[1999–2000 Miami Heat season|Miami Heat]] in seven even harder-fought games in the first two rounds of the playoffs, en route to the Eastern Conference Finals against the [[1999–2000 Indiana Pacers season|Indiana Pacers]]. But their quest for back-to-back NBA Finals appearances came to an end when they were defeated by the Pacers in 6 games in the Eastern Conference Finals. Sprewell averaged 19.7 ppg in the series, and the Knicks gave him a five-year/$62 million contract extension.&lt;ref name="espn"/&gt;

The [[2000–01 NBA season|2000–01 season]] saw Sprewell step up as the Knicks' leader with Ewing traded to the [[2000–01 Seattle SuperSonics season|Seattle SuperSonics]], making his only All-Star appearance for the Knicks that year, scoring 17.7 points off the bench. However, despite another impressive season from Sprewell the Knicks would lose in the first round to the [[2000–01 Toronto Raptors season|Toronto Raptors]] in five games in those [[2001 NBA Playoffs|2001 playoffs]].  In [[2001–02 NBA season|2001–02]] Sprewell averaged 19.4 ppg, including 49 points in a game against the [[2001–02 Boston Celtics season|Boston Celtics]], one of three times he scored 40 or more points that season; but it was not enough as the Knicks would miss the [[2002 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]] for the first time in 15 years.

Prior to the [[2002–03 NBA season|2002–03 season]], Sprewell reported to training camp with a broken hand, which he claimed occurred when he slipped on his yacht; the Knicks fined him a record $250,000 for failing to report the incident to them. He then sued the ''[[New York Post]]'' for claiming he had broken his hand in a fight.&lt;ref name="espn"&gt;[http://espn.go.com/classic/biography/s/Sprewell_Latrell.html ESPN Classic - Sprewell's Image Remains in a Chokehold&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Sprewell ultimately lost the lawsuit against the ''New York Post''.

That season, Sprewell made NBA history as he hit 9 of 9 three-point shots in one game, making the most three pointers without a single miss for the first time en route to a season-high 38 points versus the [[2002–03 Los Angeles Clippers season|Los Angeles Clippers]]. The record has since been tied by then-[[Chicago Bulls]] guard [[Ben Gordon (basketball)|Ben Gordon]] and broken by Nuggets guard [[Ty Lawson]], who made 10 threes without missing in a game against the Minnesota Timberwolves. After that season, in which the Knicks missed the [[2003 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]] for the second year in a row, Sprewell was traded to the [[2003–04 Minnesota Timberwolves season|Minnesota Timberwolves]] in a four-team trade involving [[Keith Van Horn]], [[Glenn Robinson]] and [[Terrell Brandon]].

===Minnesota Timberwolves===

In the [[2003–2004 NBA season|2003–04 season]], Sprewell became part of the league's highest-scoring trio alongside superstar [[power forward (basketball)|power forward]] [[Kevin Garnett]] and [[point guard]] [[Sam Cassell]]. With a 58-24 record, the Timberwolves qualified for the [[2004 NBA Playoffs|2004 playoffs]] as the top seed in the Western Conference. They navigated past the [[2003–04 Denver Nuggets season|Denver Nuggets]] in five games, and [[2003–04 Sacramento Kings season|Sacramento Kings]] in seven, in the first two rounds of the playoffs. In the Western Conference Finals they met the [[2003–04 Los Angeles Lakers season|Los Angeles Lakers]], who defeated them in six games thanks to miracle shooting by Laker superstar off-guard [[Kobe Bryant]], still the only appearance by the Timberwolves in the conference finals.  Sprewell finished third in team scoring at 16.8 ppg, behind Garnett's 24.2 and Cassell's 19.8.

On October 31, 2004, the [[2004–05 Minnesota Timberwolves season|Minnesota Timberwolves]] offered Sprewell a three-year, $21 million contract extension, substantially less than what his then-current contract paid him. Claiming to feel insulted by the offer he publicly expressed outrage, declaring, "I have a family to feed." He declined the extension and the Timberwolves offered him nothing more. Having once more drawn the ire of fans and sports media, Sprewell had the worst season of his career in the final year of his contract. In the summer of 2005, the [[2005–06 Denver Nuggets season|Denver Nuggets]], [[2005–06 Cleveland Cavaliers season|Cleveland Cavaliers]] and [[2005–06 Houston Rockets season|Houston Rockets]] all expressed interest in signing Sprewell, but none ended up signing him.

One month into the [[2005–06 NBA season|2005–06 season]] and without a contract, Sprewell's agent, Bob Gist, said his client would rather retire than play for the NBA minimum salary, telling ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', "Latrell doesn't need the money that badly. To go from being offered $7 million to taking $1 million, that would be a slap in the face." Several days later, Gist said that Sprewell planned to wait until "teams get desperate" around the [[trade deadline]] in February, and then sign with a contending team -an eventuality that never materialized for him. Gist said that Sprewell would not be interested in signing for any team's $5 million [[NBA Salary Cap#Mid-level exception|mid-level exception]], calling that amount "a level beneath which [Sprewell] would not stoop or kneel!"

In March 2006, Sprewell was offered contracts by the [[2005–06 Dallas Mavericks season|Dallas Mavericks]] and [[2005–06 San Antonio Spurs season|San Antonio Spurs]], both of whom were considered at the time to be strong favorites to win the [[NBA Finals|NBA Championship]], but Sprewell failed to respond and remained a free agent as the season came to a close. The [[2005–06 Los Angeles Lakers season|Los Angeles Lakers]] also showed minimal interest in him at the start of that season, but nothing ever came of it.

Over the course of his career, Sprewell started 868 of the 913 games he played in, averaging 18.8 ppg, 4.2 apg and 4.1 rpg with playoff career averages of 19.7 ppg, 3.4 apg and 4.3 rpg. He was elected to the All-NBA First Team at the end of his second season, and to the All-NBA Defensive second team that same year.

==Personal life==
Sprewell's personal life since he last played in the NBA has been plagued with controversy and financial trouble. In 1994, his four-year-old daughter was attacked by his pet [[pit bull]] and bitten in her nose, lips, forehead and one ear, requiring surgery.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1994-10-27/sports/9410270221_1_bitten-pet-dog-candace-cabbil&lt;/ref&gt; Much earlier, while attending junior college, Sprewell had been arrested for stealing.&lt;ref&gt;http://espn.go.com/blog/truehoop/post/_/id/1094/new-york-magazine-on-latrell-sprewell-in-1999&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, he appeared in a Priceline.com television advertisement, poking fun at himself.

===Relationships===
On August 30, 2006, [[Milwaukee]] police investigated a claim by a 21-year-old female who claimed that she and Sprewell were having consensual sex aboard his {{convert|70|ft|m|sing=on}} [[Yacht|yacht]], named ''Milwaukee's Best'', when Sprewell began to strangle her. Police allegedly observed red marks on her neck. Police investigating the allegation searched Sprewell's yacht for evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Bob Purvis and Charles Gardner |title=Sprewell questioned in alleged assault |url=http://www.jsonline.com/watch/?watch=1&amp;date=8/30/2006&amp;id=10707 |work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]   |date=August 30, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 6, police declined to press charges. Sprewell then sought a restraining order along with "civil remedies" against the accuser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Bob Purvis |title=No charges against Sprewell |url=http://www.jsonline.com/watch/?watch=1&amp;date=9/6/2006&amp;id=11009 |work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] |date=September 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 31, 2007, Sprewell's long-term companion sued him for $200 million for ending their relationship agreement. She claimed Sprewell agreed to support her and their four children through college.&lt;ref name='Ostler'/&gt;

===Property===

On August 22, 2007, it was reported by multiple news agencies that Sprewell's yacht was repossessed by federal marshals after failing to continue paying for and insuring the vessel, for which he reportedly still owed approximately $1.3 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=U.S. marshal seizes Sprewell's $1.5M yacht |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20396558/ |work=[[msnbc.com]] |date=August 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, while piloted by Sprewell, the yacht ran ashore near Atwater Beach, just north of Milwaukee. Sprewell refused to contract with a professional salvage firm to remove the yacht, which was eventually freed with the help of a local fishing vessel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Erin Richards |title=Sprewell's yacht freed |url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=482234 |work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] |date=August 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2008 the yacht was auctioned for $856,000 after Sprewell defaulted on a $1.5 million mortgage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=David Doege |title=Sprewell yacht sold at auction |url=http://milwaukee.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/stories/2008/02/11/newscolumn2.html?jst=pn_pn_lk |work=The Business Journal of Milwaukee |date=February 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and three months later a Milwaukee area home owned by Sprewell went into [[foreclosure]] status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Marie Rohde |title=Latrell Sprewell's home foreclosed |url=http://blogs.jsonline.com/proofandhearsay/archive/2008/05/12/latrell-sprewell-s-home-foreclosed.aspx |work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] |date=May 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between September 2007 and January 2008, according to documents, Sprewell had failed to make mortgage payments of $2,593 per month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |agency=Associated Press |title=Ex-NBA star Latrell Sprewell $1.5 million yacht, home could be foreclosed |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=3241444 |work=[[ESPN NBA]] |date=February 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2009 a Westchester mansion owned by Sprewell went into foreclosure status,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Westchester Supreme Court Index No. 09-16447&lt;/ref&gt; but that action was dismissed on motion of another party's attorney, Roger K. Marion.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

[[File:Portrait of Mary Beatrice Watson.tif|thumb|Portrait of Mary Beatrice Watson]]
'''Mary Watson''' (born 17 January 1860 – 1881), was an Australian folk heroine.&lt;ref name="S. E. Stephens"&gt;{{cite web|last=S. E. Stephens|title=Watson, Mary Beatrice Phillips (1860–1881)|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/watson-mary-beatrice-phillips-4813|publisher=Australian Dictionary of Biography|accessdate=28 November 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324192806/http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/watson-mary-beatrice-phillips-4813 |archivedate=24 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was 21 years old and had been married less than eighteen months when she died of thirst on No. 5 Island in the Howick Group off Cape Flattery in Far North [[Queensland]], [[Australia]], in 1881.&lt;ref name="S. E. Stephens"/&gt; She, with her four-month-old baby, Ferrier, and a wounded Chinese workman, Ah Sam, had drifted for eight days and some forty miles in a cut-down ship's water tank, used for boiling sea slugs, after mainland Aborigines had attacked her absent husband's ''[[Sea cucumber as food|bêche de mer]]'' station on [[Lizard Island]]. Her diary describing their last days was found with their remains in 1882,&lt;ref name="S. E. Stephens"/&gt; and Mrs Watson became an emblem of pioneer heroism for many Queenslanders.

==Early life==
Mary was born at Fiddler's Green outside [[St Newlyn East]] near [[Truro]], [[Cornwall]], [[England]], on 17 January 1860,&lt;ref name="S. E. Stephens"/&gt; the daughter of Mary Phillips and Thomas Oxnam, and migrated to [[Queensland]] with her family in 1877.&lt;ref name="S. E. Stephens"/&gt; Having accepted a position as a governess with an hotelier's family, at eighteen Mary travelled from [[Maryborough, Queensland|Maryborough]] to the isolated port of [[Cooktown]], where she met and married bêche de mer fisherman Robert F. Watson in May 1880.&lt;ref name=Williams-Dent54&gt;{{cite book|last=Nat Williams|first=Margaret Dent|title=National treasures from Australia's great libraries|year=2005|publisher=National Library of Australia|isbn=0-642-27620-X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wr5brDm38EQC&amp;pg=PA54 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life on Lizard Island==
Watson took her with him to set up a fishing station on [[Lizard Island]], then otherwise uninhabited. In September 1880, Watson left his wife and son behind with two Chinese servants known as Ah Sam and Ah Leung,&lt;ref name=Williams-Dent54/&gt; while he and his partner Percy Fuller made an extended fishing trip in their luggers.

===Aborigine attack===
A few weeks later a party of mainland Aborigines of the Guugu Yimmidir group made one of their habitual seasonal trips by canoe to the island, where Watson had set up his household in a stone structure close to a small creek, the island's only supply of fresh water. Mary had probably also inadvertently trespassed on an indigenous ceremonial ground normally taboo to women and children. The Aborigines attacked Ah Sam, who suffered seven spear wounds, and Ah Leung was killed in a vegetable garden he was tending. Mary Watson frightened off the group by firing a gun and then, with a small supply of food and water, put to sea in the iron tank, hoping to be picked up by a passing vessel. The party drifted from 2 to 7 October,&lt;ref name=Williams-Dent54/&gt; occasionally landing on reefs and islets. Mary's final diary entry ended 'No water. Near dead with thirst.'&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Her final diary entry mistakenly dated September 11 instead of October 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

When passing fishing vessels reported the wreck of [[Mrs Watson's Cottage|Mrs Watson's stone cottage]], and fires burning on the island, it was assumed that Captain Watson's wife had been kidnapped or killed. Mounted police and native troopers under Inspector Hervey Fitzgerald from Cooktown shot a number of coastal Cape York people—possibly as many as 150— from three mainland groups in retaliation. None of those shot, it would be claimed afterwards, was directly involved in the events.

===Remains found===
The remains of Mary and her baby were found some months later among the mangroves on No. 5 [[Howick Island]], still in the iron tank,&lt;ref name=Williams-Dent54/&gt; but now covered with fresh rainwater from a recent tropical downpour. Ah Sam had died on the beach nearby. A concealed spring existed on the islet, but they had not found it. When the bodies were returned to Cooktown a procession of 650 escorted them to their burial at Two Mile Cemetery (now [[Cooktown Cemetery]]), on the road to the [[Palmer River (Queensland)|Palmer River]] goldfields.&lt;ref name=Williams-Dent54/&gt;

=== Legacy ===
[[File:Mrs. Watsons Memorial at Cooktown, circa 1906.tif|thumb|Mrs. Watsons Memorial at Cooktown, circa 1906]]
Five years later a public subscription was raised to fund the [[Mary Watson's Monument]], a marble drinking fountain in the main street, completed in 1886.&lt;ref name="Williams-Dent54" /&gt; The [[James Cook Historical Museum]] in Cooktown holds a replica of the iron tank.

==Dramatic works==
In the intervening years Mrs Watson's story was retold in numerous newspaper and folk accounts, including heroic poems, usually with little attention given to the Aboriginal and Chinese aspect of the events.

A highly dramatic version of the story has been told by Australian author [[Ion Idriess]] in one of his a lesser-known titles ''The Opium Smugglers'' (1948), and was touched upon by [[Robert Drewe]] in his novel ''The Savage Crows'' (1976).&lt;ref name=Williams-Dent54/&gt; Australian painter Alan Oldfield's series of paintings 'The Story of Mrs Watson, 1881', begun in 1986 and exploring the spiritual dimensions of the events, are now in the permanent collection of the Cairns Art Gallery, North Queensland.&lt;ref name=Williams-Dent54/&gt;

An [[Arthur C. Clarke|Arthur C Clarke]] character in his 1963 novel [[Dolphin Island (novel)|''Dolphin Island'']] accurately retells the tale mentioning both Aboriginals and Chinese servants changing only the island's name to Dolphin Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.librarything.com/work/32612|title=Dolphin Island by Arthur C. Clarke|last=|first=|date=|website=LibraryThing.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180411094120/https://www.librarything.com/work/32612|archive-date=11 April 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attacks survived==
[[File:Mary of Exeter DM.jpg|thumb|Mary's grave at the Ilford Animal Cemetery]]
Mary completed many missions, including three in which she was wounded by enemy attacks, requiring a total of 22 stitches.  In addition, she survived a Luftwaffe bomber attack on her Exeter pigeon loft.&lt;ref name=Independent/&gt;

===Attacked by German war hawk===
On one occasion she was attacked by German-kept [[hawk]]s stationed in [[Pas-de-Calais]] returning home with wounds to her neck and right breast.  She recovered sufficiently and was put back in service two months later.&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;{{cite news |title= They served and suffered for us |author= Eluned Price |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3626468/They-served-and-suffered-for-us.html |newspaper= The Telegraph |date= 1 November 2004 |accessdate=8 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shot===
On another occasion, Mary returned with the tip of one wing shot off and three pellets were removed from her body.  She recovered, passed flight tests, was returned to service despite the shortened wing.&lt;ref name=Independent/&gt;

===Hit by shrapnel===
During her final trip her neck muscles were damaged by [[Shrapnel shell|shrapnel]].  Her owner made her a leather collar to hold her head up, and took her out of service.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt;

===Exeter pigeon loft bombed===
Mary's loft, located at the Exeter home of a shoemaker named Charlie Brewer who had become a loft keeper and intelligence agent during the war, was damaged during the [[Luftwaffe]]'s 1942 raids on Exeter, killing many of the pigeons housed there.  Mary, however, survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= £50,000 lottery grant for war animal graves |author= |url= http://www.metro.co.uk/news/32307-50-000-lottery-grant-for-war-animal-graves#ixzz1EEYXqg1l |newspaper= Metro |date=  |accessdate=17 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5608">'''Dr Melville Leonard Edelstein''' (1919{{mdash}}June 16, 1976)  was born to Nachum and Rose Edelstein in [[King William's Town]]. His [[Lithuanian Jews|Litvak]] parents had first travelled to the UK and then [[Cape Town]] in 1896 before joining the masses of "[[Afrikaner-Jews|boere-Jode]]" [Afrikaner or farmer Jews] where his parents had settled and Nachum started and ran a successful business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sajr.co.za/news-and-articles/2015/06/16/16-june-76-tragic-day-for-a-great-sa-jew|title=16 June ’76: Tragic day for a great SA Jew|website=South African Jewish Report|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-11-14}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work== 
Dr. Edelstein was a sociologist and respected academic and had devoted his efforts to humanitarian and social welfare projects in [[Soweto]]. Serving as Deputy Chief Welfare Officer, Dr Edelstein  instituted many projects aimed at assisting youth, disabled, poor and marginalized communities within Soweto, where he worked for some 18 years. A practicing orthodox Jew, Melville Edelstein was apolitical &amp; dedicated to serving the good of mankind. He was also a pacifist who refused to enlist for World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tubeid.co/download-video/prWwvM_niLOkjYY/2013-remembering-dr-melville-edelstein-the-life-death-of-a-good-man.html|title=2013 - Remembering Dr Melville Edelstein - the life &amp; death of a Good Man Free Download Video MP4 3GP M4A - TubeID.Co|website=TubeID.Co|access-date=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; While employed as a social worker for the Welfare Section of the Non-European Affairs Department, which fell under the [[City of Johannesburg]], he showed great concern for the people of Soweto, where he served for 18 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sajr.co.za/news-and-articles/2015/06/16/16-june-76-tragic-day-for-a-great-sa-jew|title=16 June ’76: Tragic day for a great SA Jew|website=South African Jewish Report|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov.za/trc/media%5C1996%5C9607/s960723b.htm|title=SAPA - 23 Jul 96 - DAUGHTER APPEALS TO WITNESSES TO EDELSTEIN|website=www.justice.gov.za|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death== 
Dr Edelstein was one of the two white men who died in the [[Soweto uprising]] of 16 June 1976. Dr Melville Edelstein was brutally slain by a crowd of enraged students in Soweto on June 16, 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov.za/trc/media%5C1996%5C9607/s960723j.htm|title=SAPA - 23 Jul 96 - TRUTH BODY WRAPS UP JUNE 16 HEARINGS IN SOWETO|website=www.justice.gov.za|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kevinharris.co.za/2012/06/the-life-death-of-a-good-man/|title=16 June ’76 – Remember Dr Melville Edelstein – the life &amp; death of a good man {{!}} Kevin Harris Productions|website=www.kevinharris.co.za|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier on the fateful morning, he greeted students as they passed his offices on Mputhi Street.  However once the shock of the police shooting spread through their ranks, high spirits turned to anger, and Dr Edelstein was killed for being a white official in the wrong place at the wrong time. That morning, Dr Edelstein was hosting the official opening for a branch of his Sheltered Workshop Programme in Orlando East, designed to provide employment for disabled people.  When news of the student protests reached the project, the ceremony was brought to a hurried end as dignitaries and workers were ferried out of the township.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sabctrc.saha.org.za/victims/edelstein_melville_leonard.htm?tab=report|title=Truth Commission - Special Report - Volume 2, Chapter 4|website=sabctrc.saha.org.za|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://praag.org/?tag=dr-melville-edelstein|title=Dr.Melville Edelstein – praag.org|website=praag.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/topic/june-16-soweto-youth-uprising|title=The June 16 Soweto Youth Uprising|last=Leander|date=2013-05-21|work=South African History Online|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Concerned about the safety of a woman colleague, - Pierette Jacques, back at the Youth Centre in Youth Centre in Jabavu – Dr Edelstein drove through crowds of gathering students to get to her office.  Edelstein then rushed through the offices, instructing staff to leave immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/topic/june-16-soweto-youth-uprising|title=The June 16 Soweto Youth Uprising|last=Leander|date=2013-05-21|work=South African History Online|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there an [[Mobbing|angry mob]] broke into the building and [[Stoning|stoned him to death]]. Reporter Peter Magubane later found his body with a note saying “Beware Afrikaans is the most dangerous drug for our future.” The reporter said, “If they’d known who he was, this would never have happened.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Dr-Melville-Edelstein-and-South-Africas-1976-Soweto-uprising-459090|title=Dr. Melville Edelstein and South Africa’s 1976 Soweto uprising|work=The Jerusalem Post {{!}} JPost.com|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ismaikel''' "'''Mike'''" '''Perez''' (born 20 October 1985) is a Cuban [[professional boxer]] competing as a [[cruiserweight (boxing)|cruiserweight]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ringtv.craveonline.com/news/181679-mike-perez-from-cuba-to-ireland-to-nyc-for-hbo-debut|publisher=The Ring |date= July 2014 |title=Mike Perez: from Cuba to Ireland to NYC for HBO debut - "I'm Irish now"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Perez was a successful amateur boxer in [[Cuba]]. In 2005, while competing with the Cuban team at a tournament in [[Liverpool]], he caught the eye of Irish boxing promoter Gary Hyde. Hyde later expressed his desire to turn Perez professional, and to do that he had to arrange his defection from Cuba. In December 2007, under cover of darkness, Perez swam offshore from Cuba, to a boat manned by a Mexican cartel. After transferring through two other boats, enduring storms and depleted food and water supplies, Perez eventually reached [[Mexico|Mexican]] soil nine days later. The Cartel then held him there, until they secured final payment from organizer, Gary Hyde. Upon receiving it, Perez was released, allowing him to board a flight to his new home. On January 10, 2008, Perez touched down in [[Ireland]], where he settled in [[Cork City|Cork]] along with fellow Cubans [[Alexei Collado|Alexei Acosta]] and Luis Garcia. Today, he fights under the nickname Mike "The Rebel" Perez, in reference to Cork which is known as the "Rebel County".&lt;ref name="Rebel Rising – Cork’s Mike Perez"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.punditarena.com/boxing/mmccarthy/rebel-rising-corks-mike-perez/ |publisher=Pundit Arena |date= July 2014 |title=Rebel Rising – Cork’s Mike Perez

==Amateur career==
Perez had over 400 amateur bouts. In 2004, he won gold at the [[Youth World Amateur Boxing Championships|World Junior Championships]] in [[Jeju City]], [[South Korea]]. The southpaw beat Englishman [[Danny Price (boxer)|Danny Price]] in the semifinals, before defeating Russian fighter Nikolay Pavlyukov 38-16 in the final. Perez later beat fighters such as [[Kenneth Egan]] and [[Constantin Bejenaru]], but moved up to 201 lbs and initially struggled against world class competition like [[Luis Ortiz (Cuban boxer)|Luis Ortiz]], who beat him in 2006 to become the Cuban national champion. Perez avenged that loss in the 2007 championships, but lost to [[Osmay Acosta]] in that year's final.

==Professional career==
===Early career===
In 2008, Perez turned professional under Cuban coach Nicholas Cruz Hernández, who had also moved to Ireland in 1988.

On 7 May 2011, Perez won the International Prizefighter tournament, held in [[London, England]]. Perez faced [[Kertson Manswell]] and [[Gregory Tony]], before defeating American fighter [[Tye Fields]] in the final to take home the £32,000 prize. After the fight, Perez stated the victory would earn him a world title shot in the near future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,12183_6919793,00.html|title=Perez powers to victory|work=SkySports}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boxrec"&gt;{{cite web |title=Mike Perez |publisher=BoxRec | url=http://boxrec.com/list_bouts.php?human_id=438253&amp;cat=boxer| accessdate=2011-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He then fought and won against [[United States|American]] [[Journeyman (boxing)|journeyman]] Zack Page in a rematch on November 9, 2011, in [[York Hall]], [[Bethnal Green]], [[London]].&lt;ref name="boxrec.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxrec.com/list_bouts.php?human_id=438253&amp;cat=boxer|title=BoxRec - Mike Perez|work=boxrec.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perez made his [[United States]] debut on 30 December 2011, against the [[Nigeria]]n heavyweight boxer [[Friday Ahunanya]]. The location for the fight was [[Morongo Casino, Resort &amp; Spa]], [[Cabazon]], [[California]]. Perez won a unanimous decision, by winning all of the rounds, on the judges' scorecards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://boxrec.com/show_display.php?show_id=629843] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029215306/http://boxrec.com/show_display.php?show_id=629843|date=October 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a hiatus through 2012, Perez returned to the ring in May 2013. On the undercard of [[Wladimir Klitschko]] vs. [[Francesco Pianeta]], he met American fighter [[Travis Walker]]. After 10 rounds, he took the win by way of unanimous decision.

===Perez vs. Abdusalomov and aftermath===
On November 2, 2013, he made his [[HBO]] debut against [[Magomed Abdusalomov]] at [[Madison Square Garden]]. Perez won by unanimous decision after a brutally-fought 10 rounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.badlefthook.com/2013/11/2/5059968/golovkin-vs-stevens-results-mike-perez-wins-brutal-decision-over|title=Golovkin vs Stevens results: Mike Perez wins brutal decision over Magomed Abdusalamov|author=Scott Christ|work=Bad Left Hook}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fight left Abdusalamov permanently and severely injured, as he suffered a stroke and had to go into a medically-induced coma before surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2134554-mike-perez-title-shot-ahead-disabled-foe-behind?hpt=hp_bn15|title=Mike Perez: Title Shot Ahead, Disabled Foe Behind|author=Tim Smith|work=Bleacher Report}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abdusalamov's family later sued the [[New York State Athletic Commission]] due to negligence. The lawsuit ended with a $22 million dollar settlement.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mmafighting.com/2017/9/8/16279100/boxer-gets-record-22-million-settlement-from-new-york-in-brain-injury-case&lt;/ref&gt; Perez's form dipped after this fight, as he drew and lost many of his next fights. He would later reveal that he struggled with [[alcoholism]] during this time, to the point of getting into the ring drunk a few times.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irish-boxing.com/getting-ring-drunk-mike-perez-reveals-demons-tragic-mago-fight/&lt;/ref&gt;

Perez returned on January 18, 2014 to fight Carlos Takam at the Bell Centre in Montreal. Takam and Perez fought to a [[majority draw]]. The fight was shown on HBO on the Pascal vs Bute under card.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/mike-perez-carlos-takam-on-pascal-bute-undercard--72676|title=Mike Perez-Carlos Takam on Pascal-Bute Undercard - Boxing News|work=boxingscene.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perez then lost a narrow [[split decision]] to [[Bryant Jennings]] on July 2014 on scores of 114-113 and 115-112 for Jennings and 113-114 for Perez. Referee Harvey Dock controversially deducted a point from Perez in the final round.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.badlefthook.com/2014/7/26/5941007/jennings-vs-perez-results-bryant-jennings-grabs-split-decision-win-on&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 22, 2015 Perez was brutally knocked out by [[Alexander Povetkin]] 91 seconds into a WBC heavyweight title eliminator. Following the loss to Povetkin, Perez spent over two years away from the ring, before returning in 2017 as a [[cruiserweight (boxing)|cruiserweight]].

===World Boxing Super Series===
{{Main|2017 World Boxing Super Series - Cruiserweight division}}

On July 6, Perez was announced as the final entrant to the cruiserweight [[World Boxing Super Series]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldboxingnews.net/2017/07/06/news/avni-yildrim-robert-brant-added-to-wbss-168-tourney-mike-perez-completes-cruiser-line-up&lt;/ref&gt;

====Perez vs. Briedis====
At the Draft Gala, which took place on July 8 in [[Monte Carlo]], Perez was chosen by [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] champion [[Mairis Briedis]] as his quarter final opponent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/boxing/story/_/id/19929421/matchups-set-world-boxing-super-series-super-middleweight-cruiserweight-tournaments|title=Usyk-Huck, Groves-Cox headline Super Series|work=ESPN.com|access-date=2017-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 22, the WBSS announced the fight would take place in Briedis' home country of Latvia at the [[Arēna Rīga|Riga Arena]] in Riga on September 30, 2017.

'''Mosquitor''' is a [[fictional character]] in [[Mattel|Mattel's]] ''[[Masters of the Universe]]'' [[toy]]line, one of the best-selling toylines of the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = 8 Pricey And Rare He-Man And The Masters Of The Universe Toys |work= [[BuzzFeed]]|date=|url= https://www.buzzfeed.com/briangalindo/18-pricey-and-rare-he-man-and-the-masters-of-the-universe-to#3fm4kg2|accessdate=2014-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character profile==
He is a member of the [[Evil Horde]], he was packaged as the "evil energy-draining insectoid."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wPa5DgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA456&amp;dq=Mosquitor+masters+of+the+universe&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjpnaXfyI_dAhWJL8AKHXpUAWwQ6AEINjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Mosquitor+masters+of+the+universe&amp;f=false|title=He-Man and the Masters of the Universe|first1=Val|last1=Staples|first2=James|last2=Eatock|first3=Josh|last3=DeLioncourt|first4=Danielle|last4=Gelehrter|date=28 August 2018|publisher=Dark Horse Comics|accessdate=28 August 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a [[cyborg]] creature with a long, pointed metal head, with a [[Hypodermic needle|needle]] on the end of the nose-piece which he injects into his opponents to drain the [[blood]] from them. He has a transparent metallic chest through which the blood of his opponent can be seen, filling him up to charge him with energy.

==1980s cartoon==
Mosquitor was introduced into the ''MotU'' toy line in 1987. He was one of the final figures to be released before the toy line's demise, and as a result is one of the rarest. The action figure's special feature is a switch on its back, which when pressed caused his chest to flow with blood.

The figure came packaged with the mini-comic "Enter: Buzz-Saw Hordak!"&lt;ref name="mania.com"&gt;{{cite news|title=8 Crazy Masters of the Universe Figures |work=Mania.com |date=2010-04-08 |url=http://www.mania.com/8-crazy-masters-universe-figures_article_117840.html |accessdate=2009-11-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001163220/http://www.mania.com/8-crazy-masters-universe-figures_article_117840.html |archivedate=October 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The comic reveals him as a new minion of [[Hordak]], and his main function in the story is draining the energy of [[Sorceress of Castle Grayskull|the Sorceress]], enabling Hordak to create a fake, [[holographic]] Sorceress from her life force. At a later stage in the story, he is set upon [[He-Man]], and almost overpowers him. The comic also hints at a tension between himself and [[Dragstor]]; after serving as a test object for Mosquitor's ability, Dragstor clearly resents Mosquitor's great power and his value to Hordak.

Mosquitor also appears in the ''MotU'' Marvel comics, where he is able to fly and shoot beams from the needle of his nose-piece.

Given that he was released so late into the toyline's run, Mosquitor's exposure was minimal throughout the various story media and he never made an [[animated]] appearance.

The action figure first released by [[Mattel]] in 1987 is a very rare and sought after collectors item today. Its rare existence can be attributed to being released very late into the toy series original run. The [[mint condition]] (known as MOC / Mint on Card) version of this figure can fetch high dollars on auction sites such as [[eBay]].

==2002 cartoon==
He also did not appear in the updated ''[[He-Man and the Masters of the Universe (2002)|Masters of the Universe]]'' cartoon series, produced in 2002 by [[Mike Young Productions]], or in its tie-in comics. The Horde were intended to be released among the next wave of villains and fill the role of main opposition to He-Man in the show's third season. The second-season episode "The Power of Grayskull" features the Horde in a flashback sequence, as an evil force from Ancient Eternia. However, since the toy line and cartoon were canceled shortly afterwards, the third season was never made.

Mosquitor was released by [[National Entertainment Collectibles Association|NECA]] as part of Series 6 of the ''Masters of the Universe'' series of [[statues|ministatues]] designed by [[Four Horsemen Studios]].

==Reception==
Mosquitor was voted No.6 in The 10 Most Unfortunate Masters Of The Universe Toys by [[Io9]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = The 10 Most Unfortunate Masters Of The Universe Toys |work= [[Io9]]|date=|url= http://io9.com/5508866/the-10-most-unfortunate-masters-of-the-universe-toys|accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mosquitor was voted by Mania.com as the second most Crazy Masters of the Universe Figures.&lt;ref name="mania.com"/&gt; Mosquitor was voted No.9 in The 12 Coolest Masters of the Universe Action Features by [[Topless Robot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= The 12 Coolest Masters of the Universe Action Features|publisher= [[Topless Robot]]|date=|url= http://www.toplessrobot.com/2009/04/the_12_coolest_masters_of_the_universe_action_feat.php?page=2|accessdate=2014-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paul Williams''' (born July 27, 1981) is an American former [[professional boxer]] who competed from 2000 to 2012. He won the [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] [[welterweight]] title twice, in 2007 and 2008; the WBO [[interim championship|interim]] [[junior middleweight]] title in 2008; and challenged for the unified [[middleweight]] title in 2010. Nicknamed "'''The Punisher'''", and standing at a height of 6 foot 1 inches, Williams was unusually tall for the three divisions in which he competed. His career was cut short in 2012 after a motorcycle accident left him [[paraplegia|paralyzed from the waist down]].&lt;ref name="spinalcord1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/boxing/story/_/id/8048632/|title=Paul Williams' future uncertain|first=Norm|last=Frauenheim|date=June 13, 2012|agency=Associated Press|publisher=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=September 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spinalcord2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ringtv.craveonline.com/blog/173321|title=Manager: Williams in good spirits, adds 'We like where we are'|first=Lem|last=Satterfield|date=June 13, 2012|publisher=''[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]''|accessdate=September 20, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202234141/http://ringtv.craveonline.com/blog/173321|archivedate=December 2, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Professional career ==

=== Early years at welterweight ===
His debut was in the year 2000. He is promoted by the Goossens. In 2005 he outpointed former Olympic bronze medalist Terrence Cauthen and, later that year, he knocked out Alfonso Sanchez in 5 rounds.
His [[ESPN]] debut was a second-round knockout of Sergio Rios on [[Wednesday Night Fights]]. Williams made his [[HBO]] debut against then-undefeated [[Walter Matthysse]], winning by a tenth-round technical knockout.&lt;ref group="Video"&gt;{{Cite video|date=June 30, 2011|title=HBO Boxing: Paul Williams's Greatest Hits (HBO) |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7G3BOnGcI|medium=[[YouTube]] video: Fights against Walter Matthysse, Sharmba Mitchell, Santos Pakau, Antonio Margarito, Carlos Quintana (first meeting), Verno Phillips, Winky Wright, Sergio Gabriel Martínez (first meeting) and Kermit Cintrón|publisher=[[HBO|HBO Sports]]|accessdate=September 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; That was followed by a victory over former junior welterweight world champion [[Sharmba Mitchell]]. He knocked Mitchell down three times en route to a fourth-round TKO.

==== WBO Welterweight Championship ====
&lt;!--  Commented out: [[File:WilliamsvsKolle24.jpg|thumb|left|213px|Paul Williams punches [[Andy Kolle]].]] --&gt;
Williams became the mandatory challenger for [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] [[Welterweight]] Champion [[Antonio Margarito]]. The match took place July 14, 2007, in [[Carson, California]], at the Home Depot Center with Williams winning a unanimous decision in which turned out to be a close fight where Williams' seemingly stronger finish seemed to seal him the decision victory in the eyes of boxing experts and fans alike.
Williams fought [[Carlos Quintana (boxer)|Carlos Quintana]] on February 9, 2008 in his first defense of his title. Williams lost to Quintana by decision in what many considered a minor upset.

Williams and Quintana had a rematch at the [[Mohegan Sun Arena]] in [[Uncasville, Connecticut]] on June 7, 2008 for the WBO Welterweight title, at Williams' request. Williams got off to a quick start when a left hand sent Quintana into a daze as several follow-up barrages put Quintana down. He got up, but Williams opened up with dozens of unanswered punches as the referee jumped in to stop the fight while Quintana was going down again.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boxingscene.com/?m=show&amp;id=14346 Paul Williams Blows Away Carlos Quintana in One-Round] BoxingScene.com URL accessed 9 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Williams was rumored to be moving up two weight classes to fight [[Kelly Pavlik]] for the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] [[Middleweight]] title but instead Pavlik himself decided to move up two weight classes himself to fight [[Bernard Hopkins]]. Williams fought [[Andy Kolle]] on September 25. Williams dominated the fight from the start and recorded a first-round knockout in 1:37 seconds.

=== Light Middleweight ===
After failing to secure another meaningful contest at welterweight, Williams vacated his WBO welterweight title in order to fight [[Verno Phillips]] for the WBO Interim [[Light Middleweight]] title.

On November 29, 2008, Williams defeated Phillips by way of TKO after 8 rounds after the Doctor stopped the fight. In doing so he secured the WBO Interim Light Middleweight title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.secondsout.com/USA/news.cfm?ccs=229&amp;cs=41848 |title=SecondsOut Boxing News - USA Boxing News - Williams Batters Phillips/ Arreola De-rails 'Freight Train' |publisher=Secondsout.com |date=2008-11-30 |accessdate=2014-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Middleweight ===

==== Winky Wright ====

Williams fought [[Winky Wright]] on April 11, 2009, in a 12-round middleweight bout featured on [[HBO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/?m=show&amp;id=17731 |title=Paul Williams-Winky Wright Agreement Reached For April - Boxing News |publisher=Boxingscene.com |date=2009-01-04 |accessdate=2014-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams defeated Wright in a unanimous decision which was not close on the scorecards &amp;ndash; two of the three judges gave Williams all but one round while the third scored all 12 rounds for Williams.

Williams was then preparing to fight Middleweight Champion Kelly Pavlik in a bout scheduled to take place on October 3, 2009 in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rafael |first=Dan |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/blog/index?entryID=4366393&amp;name=rafael_dan |title=Dan Rafael Blog - ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bout was postponed when it was discovered Pavlik had a staph infection in his knuckle and had been rescheduled for December 5. However, the bout was called off for a second time six weeks prior to the fight because Pavlik's infection had not completely healed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=4583115 |title=Infection on finger of Kelly Pavlik's left hand forces title fight vs. Paul Williams to be called off - ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2009-10-21 |accessdate=2014-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sergio Martínez ====
On December 5, 2009 Paul Williams fought [[Sergio Gabriel Martínez|Sergio Martínez]] in a war of a twelve-round main event. In the first round Martinez was knocked down due to bad balance and a grazing left hand that landed just below the ear. In the final seconds of the 1st round though Martinez scored a knockdown of his own over Williams. The next two rounds were heavily in Martinez's favor as he hit Williams with barrages of counter punches. After Martinez was seemingly won the first 3 rounds, rounds 4-7 showed Williams coming back effectively landing hard lefts to the head of Martinez. In rounds 8-10 Martinez again confused Williams with using different varieties of punches, including straight lead lefts to the body followed by right hooks to the head and straight lefts to the face. The final 2 rounds showed much fatigue in Martinez and Williams but both warriors fought through to the end, although Williams seemed to win both of the last 2 rounds by being the far more active boxer (while the punching exchanges were very closely contested during those final 2 rounds as well), which would ultimately prove to be the difference and as a result of having far superior activity during those final 2 rounds, Williams won a close majority decision over Martinez. The judges scored the fight 114-114, 115-113 for Williams and 119-110 for Williams, thus making Williams emerge as the majority decision winner.

==== Kermit Cintron ====
After his close win over Sergio Martínez, Paul Williams moved on to face Puerto Rican prospect [[Kermit Cintrón]]. The two met on May 8, 2010 Live on Saturday Night HBO Boxing. In the fourth round, Kermit Cintron fell out of the ring unintentionally and was not allowed to continue fighting due to hitting the arena floor. Williams was ahead on two of the three judges' scorecards at the time of the stoppage and was declared the winner by split technical decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== [[Sergio Martinez vs. Paul Williams II|Williams vs Martinez II]] ===
[[File:Paul Williams' team with HBO camera.jpg|thumb|Williams before the Martínez fight in November 2010]]
A highly anticipated rematch with Sergio Martinez eventually materialized at [[Boardwalk Hall]], Atlantic City, New Jersey on November 20, 2010. Upon the Williams camp's insistence, the fight was contested at the catchweight limit of 158 pounds instead of the middleweight limit of 160, with Martinez's WBC Middleweight title on the line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2010/writers/bryan_armen_graham/11/21/sergio.martinez.paul.williams/ | work=CNN | title=Martinez rises to pound-for-pound elite after KO of Williams | date=2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fight was billed as a potential "fight-of-the-year," however the fight ended abruptly and dramatically when [[Sergio Gabriel Martínez|Sergio Martinez]] delivered a knockout blow with 2:02 left in the 2nd round. The punch was a short left cross that caught Williams right on the chin as he attempted to deliver a left-hand of his own. Williams' right hand was at his waist when the punch landed, rendering Paul Williams unconscious upon contact.

=== Erislandy Lara ===
On  July 9, 2011, Paul Williams fought in a light middleweight contest in Atlantic City against former Cuban amateur sensation Erislandy Lara. Throughout the fight, Lara repeatedly hit Williams with hard left hands and appeared to have won the fight convincingly in the eyes of the HBO crew and those sitting at ringside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.badlefthook.com/2011/7/10/2269391/paul-williams-vs-erislandy-lara-decision-judging-new-jersey |title=Paul Williams vs. Erislandy Lara Decision Update: New Jersey Commission To Speak To Judges |publisher=Bad Left Hook |date= |accessdate=2014-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://queensberry-rules.com/2011-articles/july/paul-williams-tops-erislandy-lara-in-one-of-the-worst-decisions-youll-ever-see.html |title=Paul Williams Tops Erislandy Lara In One Of The Worst Decisions You’ll Ever See |publisher=Queensberry Rules |date=2011-07-10 |accessdate=2014-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.datruthboxing.com/blog.cfm/post/highway-robbery-paul-williams-given-christmas-gift-decision-win-over-lara/ ]{{dead link|date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the judges awarded Williams with a narrow majority decision, a highly controversial verdict that ultimately led to the suspension of the three judges by the New Jersey Athletic Control Board.

== Motorcycle accident and paralysis ==
On May 27, 2012, Williams was severely injured when he crashed his motorcycle in Georgia. He swerved to avoid hitting a car while traveling at about 75&amp;nbsp;mph on the motorcycle and was launched sixty feet. Witnesses say he landed on his head and his body "folded like a suitcase."&lt;ref group="Video" name="shosports"&gt;{{Cite video|date=September 21, 2012|title=Showtime Boxing: Paul Williams Interview with Jim Gray - SHOWTIME|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfJUnt8k3is|medium=YouTube video|publisher=[[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime Sports]]|accessdate=September 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accident left him with a part of his spinal cord severely bruised, paralyzing him from the waist down. Since it was bruised and not severed, it gives him a chance to regain sensation.&lt;ref name="spinalcord1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="spinalcord2" /&gt; The doctors told Williams the swelling could go down in a year or two, potentially giving him a chance of walking again. The accident came as Williams was preparing for his PPV main event against [[Saúl Álvarez|Canelo Alvarez]] on September 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/boxing/story/_/id/7961636/saul-canelo-alvarez-face-paul-williams-sept-15-par-per-view-bout|title= Saul Alvarez to face Paul Williams|first=Dan|last=Rafael|accessdate= 2012-05-29|date=2012-05-23|publisher=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I'm just chilling in a wheelchair because I got tired of walking," Williams said in an interview with [[Jim Gray (sportscaster)|Jim Gray]] on ''[[Showtime Championship Boxing]]'' on the day he was supposed to fight. "Whether I am walking or not walking, my game ain't over until the Lord takes my life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ringtv.craveonline.com/blog/174787|title=Paul Williams: "I think I can come back"|first=Norm|last=Frauenheim|date=September 14, 2012|publisher=''The Ring''|accessdate=September 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="Video" name="shosports" /&gt;

The '''pig-nosed turtle''' (''Carettochelys insculpta''), also known as the '''pitted-shelled turtle''' or '''Fly River turtle''', is a [[species]] of [[turtle]] native to northern [[Australia]] and southern [[New Guinea]].

==Systematics==
''Carettochelys insculpta'' is the only living member of the [[genus]] ''Carettochelys'', the [[subfamily]] Carettochelyinae and the [[Family (biology)|family]] Carettochelyidae, though several extinct carettochelyid species have been described from around the world.  Some literature claims two [[subspecies]], but a recent paper rejects this.&lt;ref&gt;Georges, A.; Thomson,  S. (2010). "Diversity of Australasian freshwater turtles, with an annotated synonymy and keys to species". ''Zootaxa'' '''2496''': 1–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Carettochelys insculpta 2010.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=1|left|(video) Pig-nosed turtle swimming]]
The pig-nosed turtle is unlike any other species of freshwater turtle.  The feet are [[flipper (anatomy)|flippers]], resembling those of [[sea turtle|marine turtles]].  The nose looks like that of a [[pig]], having the [[nostril]]s at the end of a fleshy snout, hence the common name.  The [[carapace]] is typically [[grey]] or [[olive (color)|olive]], with a leathery texture, while the [[plastron]] is [[Cream (color)|cream]]-coloured. Males can be distinguished from females by their longer and narrower [[tail]]s.  Pig-nosed turtles can grow to about {{convert|70|cm|in|abbr=on}} carapace length, with a weight of over {{convert|20|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.

[[File:Carettochelys.insculpta-ZOO.Brno.jpg|thumb|right|''C. insculpta'' in captivity]]
Unlike the soft-shelled turtles of the family [[Trionychidae]], pig-nosed turtles retain a domed bony carapace beneath their leathery skin, rather than a flat plate. They also retain a solid plastron, connected to the carapace by a strong bony bridge, rather than the soft margin of the trionychids.&lt;ref name=EoR&gt;{{cite book |editor=Cogger, H.G. |editor-link=Harold Cogger |editor2=Zweifel, R.G. |editor2-link=Richard G. Zweifel|author= Obst, Fritz Jurgen|year=1998|title=Encyclopedia of Reptiles and Amphibians|publisher= Academic Press|location=San Diego|isbn= 0-12-178560-2|page= 118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Behavior==
Pig-nosed turtles are not completely aquatic. Little is known about their general behaviour, as there have been few studies in the wild. Their known extreme aggression&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tortoise.org/archives/pignose.html |title=The Pig-nosed Turtle, ''Carettochelys insculpta'' |author= Bargeron, Michael |date=1997|publisher=California Turtle &amp; Tortoise Club |accessdate=2013-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; in captivity suggests the species is markedly more territorial than most other turtles and tortoises. They seem to display a degree of social structure during the cooler dry season around the [[hydrothermal vent]]s that line some river systems they inhabit.

===Feeding===
''C. insculpta'' is [[omnivore|omnivorous]], eating a wide variety of plant and animal matter, including the [[fruit]] and [[leaf|leaves]] of [[ficus|fig]]s, as well as [[crustacean]]s, [[mollusc]]s and [[insect]]s.

===Breeding===
Females of ''C. insculpta'' reach maturity at 18 or more years, and males around 16 years.  They lay their [[egg (biology)|eggs]] late in the [[dry season]] on sandy river banks. When the offspring are fully developed, they will stay inside the eggs in [[hibernation]] until conditions are suitable for emergence. Hatching may be triggered when the eggs have been flooded with water or by a sudden drop in air pressure signaling an approaching storm.

Using environmental triggers, along with vibrations created by other hatching turtles in the same [[clutch (eggs)|clutch]], gives a better chance for survival.  Using a universal trigger rather than simply waiting for incubation to finish means they all hatch at the same time.  This provides safety in numbers; also, the more turtles that hatch, the more help they have to dig through the sand to the surface.

==Geographic range and [[habitat]]==
''C. insculpta'' is native to [[freshwater]] streams, lagoons and rivers of the [[Northern Territory]] of Australia, as well as to the island of [[New Guinea]], where it is believed to occur in all the larger, and some smaller, southward-flowing rivers.&lt;ref name=Georges&gt;Georges, A.; Rose, M. (1993). "Conservation biology of the pig-nosed turtle, ''Carettochelys insculpta'' ". ''Chelonian Conservation and Biology'' '''1''': 3-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Status and conservation==
''C. insculpta'' experienced a population decline of more than 50% in the thirty years between 1981 and 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treehugger.com/files/2011/07/unique-pig-nosed-turtle-reaches-brink-of-extinction.php |title=Unique Pig-Nosed Turtle Reaches Brink of Extinction |publisher=TreeHugger |accessdate=2011-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the turtles are protected in [[Indonesia]] under Law No. 5/1990 on Natural Resources and Ecosystems Conservation, [[smuggling]] occurs. Some 11,000 turtles captured from smugglers were released into their habitats in the [[Wania River]], Papua Province, Indonesia, on 30 December 2010. In March 2009, more than 10,000 turtles retrieved from smugglers were also released into the [[Otakwa River]] in [[Lorentz National Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antaranews.com/en/news/1293785089/over-10-000-pig-nose-turtles-released-into-habitat |title=Over 10,000 pig-nose turtles released into habitat. |publisher=Antara News |date=2010-12-31 |accessdate=2011-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; 687 pig-nosed turtles were seized at an Indonesian airport in March 2013. They were reportedly destined for [[Hong Kong]].

==Captive care==
[[File:Carettochelys insculpta LA zoo.jpg|thumb|left|''Carettochelys insculpta'' at the [[Los Angeles Zoo]].]]

Pig-nosed turtles have become available through the exotic [[pet]] trade, with a few instances of [[captive breeding]]. While juveniles are small and grow slowly, their high cost and large potential size makes them suitable only for experienced aquatic turtle keepers. They tend to be shy and prone to stress. They get sick easily, which can cause problems with their feeding, but they are known to eat commercially available processed turtle pellets or trout chow, as well as various fruits and vegetables. Breeding is rarely an option to the hobbyist, as adults are highly aggressive and will attack each other in all but the largest enclosures.

Wild populations of this turtle are declining rapidly because of illegal capture for the pet trade. It is estimated that between 2003 and 2013, more than 80,000 individuals were confiscated in 30 seizures in Papua New Guinea and Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pri.org/stories/2014-10-08/pig-nosed-turtles-are-adorable-and-thats-made-them-target-traffickers&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Programmable matter''' is [[matter]] which has the ability to change its physical properties (shape, density, [[Moduli (physics)|moduli]], conductivity, optical properties, etc.) in a programmable fashion, based upon user input or autonomous sensing.  Programmable matter is thus linked to the concept of a material which inherently has the ability to perform information processing.

== History ==
Programmable matter is a term originally coined in 1991 by [[Tommaso Toffoli|Toffoli]] and [[Norman Margolus|Margolus]] to refer to an ensemble of fine-grained computing elements arranged in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Toffoli | first1 = Tommaso | author1-link = Tommaso Toffoli | last2 = Margolus | first2 = Norman | author2-link = Norman Margolus | title = Programmable matter: concepts and realization | journal = Physica D | volume = 47 | pages = 263–272 | url = http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=104699.104736 | date = 1991 | doi = 10.1016/0167-2789(91)90296-L }} &lt;/ref&gt;  Their paper describes a computing [[Substrate (materials science)|substrate]] that is composed of fine-grained compute nodes distributed throughout space which communicate using only nearest neighbor interactions.  In this context, programmable matter refers to compute models similar to [[cellular automata]] and [[lattice gas automata]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Rothman | first=D.H. | last2=Zaleski | first2 = S. | title=Lattice Gas Cellular Automata | publisher=Cambridge University Press | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=STHngizh7LoC | origyear = 1997|date=2004 | isbn = 9780521607605 }} &lt;/ref&gt;  The CAM-8 architecture is an example hardware realization of this model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/im/cam8/ |title=CAM8: a Parallel, Uniform, Scalable Architecture for Cellular Automata Experimentation |publisher=Ai.mit.edu |accessdate=2013-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This function is also known as "digital referenced areas" (DRA) in some forms of [[self-replicating machine]] science.&lt;ref name=dra&gt;[http://www.geocities.com/charles_c_22191/temporarypreviewfile.html?1205202563050 http://www.geocities.com/charles_c_22191/temporarypreviewfile.html?1205202563050] {{dead link|date=April 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1990s, there was a significant amount of work in reconfigurable modular robotics with a philosophy similar to programmable matter.&lt;ref name=dra/&gt;

As [[semiconductor]] technology, [[nanotechnology]], and self-replicating machine technology have advanced, the use of the term programmable matter has changed to reflect the fact that
it is possible to build an ensemble of elements which can be "programmed" to change their physical properties in reality, not just in [[simulation]].  Thus, programmable matter has come to mean "any bulk substance which can be programmed to change its physical properties."

In the summer of 1998, in a discussion on artificial atoms and programmable matter, [[Wil McCarthy]] and G. Snyder coined the term "quantum wellstone" (or simply "wellstone") to describe this hypothetical but plausible form of programmable matter.  McCarthy has used the term in his fiction.

In 2002, Seth Goldstein and Todd Mowry started the [[claytronics]] project at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] to investigate the underlying hardware and software mechanisms necessary to realize programmable matter.

In 2004, the [[DARPA]] Information Science and Technology group (ISAT) examined the potential of programmable matter.  This resulted in the 2005–2006 study "Realizing Programmable Matter", which laid out a multi-year program for the research and development of programmable matter.

In 2007, programmable matter was the subject of a DARPA research solicitation and subsequent program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darpa.mil/dso/solicitations/baa07-21mod9.html |title=DARPA research solicitation |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715100834/http://www.darpa.mil/dso/solicitations/baa07-21mod9.html |archivedate=July 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darpa.mil/dso/thrusts/physci/newphys/program_matter/ DARPA Strategic Thrusts: Programmable Matter] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101212042616/http://www.darpa.mil/dso/thrusts/physci/newphys/program_matter/ |date=December 12, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Approaches ==
[[File:Adaptnetic Structures.webm|thumb|A 'simple' programmable matter where the programmable element is external to the material itself. Magnetized non-Newtonian fluid, forming support columns which resist impacts and sudden pressure.]] In one school of thought the programming could be external to the material and might be achieved by the "application of light, voltage, electric or magnetic fields, etc."  {{harv|McCarthy|2006}}. For example, a [[liquid crystal display]] is a form of programmable matter.  A second school of thought is that the individual units of the ensemble can compute and the result of their computation is a change in the ensemble's physical properties.  An example of this more ambitious form of programmable matter is [[claytronics]].
 
There are many proposed implementations of programmable matter.  Scale is one key differentiator between different forms of programmable matter. At one end of the spectrum reconfigurable modular robotics pursues a form of programmable matter where the individual units are in the centimeter size range.&lt;ref name="dra" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://groups.csail.mit.edu/drl/research.html Research&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20051116051221/http://www.robotics.upenn.edu/people/yim.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
At the nanoscale end of the spectrum there are a tremendous number of different bases for programmable matter, ranging from shape changing molecules&lt;ref name="stoddart.chem.ucla"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stoddart.chem.ucla.edu/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041012001534/http://stoddart.chem.ucla.edu/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2004-10-12 |title=UCLA Chemistry and Biochemistry |publisher=Stoddart.chem.ucla.edu |accessdate=2013-04-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[quantum dot]]s.  Quantum dots are in fact often referred to as artificial atoms.  In the micrometer to sub-millimeter range examples include [[Microelectromechanical systems|MEMS]]-based units, cells created using [[synthetic biology]], and the [[utility fog]] concept.

An important sub-group of programmable matter are [[robotic materials]], which combine the structural aspects of a composite with the affordances offered by tight integration of sensors, actuators, computation and communication,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/347/6228/1261689.abstract M. A. McEvoy and N. Correll. Materials that couple sensing, actuation, computation, and communication. ''Science'' 347(6228), 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt; while foregoing reconfiguration by particle motion.

== Examples  ==
There are many conceptions of programmable matter, and thus many discrete avenues of research using the name.  Below are some specific examples of programmable matter.

=== "Simple" ===
These include materials that can change their properties based on some input, but do not have the ability to do complex computation by themselves.

====Complex fluids====
{{main|Complex fluids}}
The physical properties of several complex fluids can be modified by applying a current or voltage, as is the case with [[liquid crystals]].

====Metamaterials====
{{main|Metamaterials}}
Metamaterials are artificial [[Composite material|composites]] that can be controlled to react in ways that do not occur in nature.  One example developed by David Smith and then by John Pendry and David Schuri is of a material that can have its [[index of refraction]] tuned so that it can have a different index of refraction at different points in the material. If tuned properly this could result in an "invisibility cloak."

A further example of programmable -mechanical- metamaterial is presented by Bergamini et al.&lt;ref name="adaptive phononic crystal"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, a pass band within the phononic bandgap is introduced, by exploiting variable stiffness of piezoelectric elements linking aluminum stubs to the aluminum plate to create a phononic crystal as in the work of Wu et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The piezoelectric elements are shunted to ground over synthetic inductors. Around the resonance frequency of the LC circuit formed by the piezoelectric and the inductors, the piezoelectric elements exhibit near zero stiffness, thus effectively disconnecting the stubs from the plate. This is considered an example of programmable mechanical metamaterial.&lt;ref name="adaptive phononic crystal"/&gt;

====Shape-changing molecules====
An active area of research is in molecules that can change their shape, as well as other properties, in response to external stimuli.  These molecules can be used individually or en masse to form new kinds of materials.  For example, [[James Fraser Stoddart|J Fraser Stoddart]]'s group at UCLA has been developing molecules that can change their electrical properties.&lt;ref name="stoddart.chem.ucla" /&gt;

====Electropermanent magnets====
{{main|Electropermanent magnet}}
An electropermanent magnet is a type of [[magnet]] which consists of both an [[electromagnet]] and a dual material [[permanent magnet]], in which the [[magnetic field]] produced by the electromagnet is used to change the magnetization of the permanent magnet. The permanent magnet consists of magnetically hard and soft materials, of which only the soft material can have its magnetization changed. When the magnetically soft and hard materials have opposite magnetizations the magnet has no net field, and when they are aligned the magnet displays magnetic behaviour.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

They allow creating controllable permanent magnets where the magnetic effect can be maintained without requiring a continuous supply of electrical energy. For these reasons, electropermanent magnets are essential components of the research studies aiming to build programmable magnets that can give rise to self-building structures.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web

=== Robotics-based approaches ===

====Self-reconfiguring modular robotics====
{{main|Self-reconfiguring modular robot}}
Self-reconfiguring modular robotics is a field of robotics in which a group of basic robot modules work together to dynamically form shapes and create behaviours suitable for many tasks, similar to programmable matter. SRCMR aims to offer significant improvement to many kinds of objects or systems by introducing many new possibilities. For example: 1. Most important is the incredible flexibility that comes from the ability to change the physical structure and behavior of a solution by changing the software that controls modules. 2. The ability to self-repair by automatically replacing a broken module will make SRCMR solution incredibly resilient. 3. Reducing the environmental footprint by reusing the same modules in many different solutions. Self-reconfiguring modular robotics enjoys a vibrant and active research community.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Yim|Shen|Salemi|Rus|2007|pp=43–52}} An overview of recent work and challenges&lt;/ref&gt;

====Claytronics====
{{main|Claytronics}}
Claytronics is an emerging field of [[engineering]] concerning reconfigurable [[nanoscale]] [[robot]]s ('claytronic [[atoms]]', or ''catoms'') designed to form much larger scale [[machines]] or mechanisms.  The catoms will be sub-millimeter computers that will eventually have the ability to move around, communicate with other computers, change color, and [[electrostatic]]ally connect to other catoms to form different shapes.

====Cellular automata====
{{main|Cellular automata}}
Cellular automata are a useful concept to abstract some of the concepts of discrete units interacting to give a desired overall behavior.

=== Quantum wells ===
{{main|Quantum well}}
Quantum wells can hold one or more electrons. Those electrons behave like [[artificial atom]]s which, like real atoms, can form [[covalent bonds]], but these are extremely weak. Because of their larger sizes, other properties are also widely different.

=== Synthetic biology ===
{{main|Synthetic biology}}
Synthetic biology is a field that aims to engineer cells with "novel biological functions."  Such [[Cell (biology)|cells]] are usually used to create larger systems (e.g., [[biofilms]]) which can be "programmed" utilizing synthetic [[gene networks]] such as [[James Collins (bioengineer)|genetic toggle switches]], to change their color, shape, etc. Such bioinspired approaches to materials production has been demonstrated, using self-assembling bacterial biofilm materials that can be programmed for specific functions, such as substrate adhesion, nanoparticle templating, and protein immobilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nguyen|first1=Peter|title=Programmable biofilm-based materials from engineered curli nanofibres|journal=Nature Communications|date=Sep 17, 2014|volume=5|page=4945|doi=10.1038/ncomms5945|pmid=25229329|url=http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2014/140917/ncomms5945/abs/ncomms5945.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His body has been [[cryopreservation|cryopreserved]], like the bodies of his first and second wives, and his mother.

==Personal background==
Ettinger was born in Atlantic City, New Jersey, the son of Russian Jewish immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/science-obituaries/8658435/Robert-Ettinger.html |title=Robert Ettinger |publisher=Telegraph |date= July 24, 2011|accessdate=July 26, 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being raised in a Jewish family, he later on became an [[Atheism|atheist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Robert Ettinger|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/science-obituaries/8658435/Robert-Ettinger.html|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=May 1, 2013|date=July 24, 2011|quote=Despite his Jewish roots, he grew up a determined atheist.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served as a [[US Second Lieutenant|second lieutenant]] [[infantry]]man in the [[United States Army]] during [[World War II]]. Severely wounded in battle in Germany, he received the [[Purple Heart]]&lt;ref name="RCWE"/&gt; and recovered after several years spent in a Michigan hospital.&lt;ref name="mensa cryonics"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.cryonicssociety.org/articles_mensajournal.html |title= A Brain Is A Terrible Thing To Waste | work= [[Mensa International]] |accessdate= August 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He earned two master's degrees from [[Wayne State University]] (one in [[physics]], one in mathematics) and spent his working career teaching physics and mathematics at both Wayne State University and [[Highland Park, Michigan|Highland Park]] [[Community college]] in [[Michigan]].&lt;ref name="RCWE"/&gt;

Ettinger had two children with his first wife, Elaine, David (1951) and Shelley (1954).&lt;ref name="RCWE"/&gt; David gave his first [[cryonics]] [[interview]] to journalists at the age of 12 and was an attorney. He served as legal counsel to the Cryonics Institute and the Immortalist Society. Robert Ettinger's daughter, who has had no interest in cryonics, is a writer and revolutionary socialist.

Ettinger met his second wife, Mae Junod, in 1962 when she attended one of his adult education courses in basic physics. Junod typed and assisted with editing the manuscripts for both ''The Prospect of Immortality'' and ''Man into Superman''. She became active in the Cryonics Society of Michigan (CSM) and edited and was production manager for the CSM monthly newsletter, ''The Outlook''. In the 1970s ''The Outlook'' was renamed ''The Immortalist'' and Junod continued editorship until the mid-1990s. ''The Outlook'' is the longest continuously published cryonics magazine.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Junod was an author, feminist, and [[family therapy|marriage counselor]].

Ettinger married Junod in 1988 after the death of his first wife.&lt;ref name="RCWE"/&gt; Ettinger described his time with Junod as one of the most satisfying and tranquil times in his life. The couple moved to [[Scottsdale, Arizona]] in 1995 and enjoyed a period of domestic life during which time the couple began to ease into retirement from over 30 years of cryonics activism and the attendant burdens of work and controversy.&lt;ref name="RCWE"/&gt; Mae Ettinger suffered a debilitating stroke in 1998 from which she never fully recovered followed by a lethal stroke in 2000, which resulted in her cryopreservation.

Ettinger died on July 23, 2011 in Detroit, Michigan of natural causes, and was cryopreserved.&lt;ref name="APdeath"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Roots of cryonics in science fiction==
Ettinger grew up reading [[Hugo Gernsback]]'s ''[[Amazing Stories]]''.&lt;ref name="regis87"/&gt; Ettinger was particularly affected when he was 12 years old by a [[Neil R. Jones]] story, "The Jameson Satellite," which appeared in the July 1931 issue of ''Amazing Stories'',&lt;ref name="regis87"/&gt; in which one Professor Jameson had his [[Cadaver|corpse]] sent into earth [[orbit]] where (as the author mistakenly thought) it would remain preserved indefinitely at near [[absolute zero]]. And so it did, in the story, until millions of years later, when, with humanity extinct, a race of mechanical men with [[Tissue (biology)|organic]] brains chanced upon it. They revived and repaired Jameson's brain, installed it in a mechanical body, and he became one of their company.&lt;ref name="RCWE"/&gt;

Ettinger assumed that one day&amp;nbsp;— long before he grew old&amp;nbsp;— [[biologist]]s would learn the secret of [[Fountain of Youth|eternal youth]]. As he grew out of boyhood in the 1930s, he began to suspect it might take a little longer since no scientists were yet working on this particular endeavor.&lt;ref name="regis87"/&gt; If [[immortality]] is achievable through the ministrations of technologically advanced aliens repairing a frozen human corpse, then Ettinger thought everyone could be [[cryopreservation|cryopreserved]] to await later rescue by our own medically more sophisticated [[Kinship|descendants]].&lt;ref name="regis87"/&gt;

==Launching the cryonics movement==
Ettinger waited expectantly for prominent scientists or physicians to come to the same conclusion he had, and to take a position of public advocacy. By 1960, Ettinger finally made the scientific case for the idea, which had always been in the back of his mind. Ettinger was 42 years old and said he was increasingly aware of his own mortality.&lt;ref name="regis87"&gt;{{cite book |title= Great Mambo Chicken and the Transhuman Condition: Science Slightly Over The Edge|last= Regis|first= Ed|authorlink=Ed Regis (author) |coauthors= |year= 1991|publisher= Westview Press|location= |isbn= 0-201-56751-2|page= |pages= 87–88|url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In what has been characterized as an historically important [[mid-life crisis]],&lt;ref name="regis87"/&gt; Ettinger summarized the idea of cryonics in a few pages, with the emphasis on [[life insurance]], and sent this to approximately 200 people whom he selected from ''[[Marquis Who's Who|Who's Who in America]]''.&lt;ref name="regis87"/&gt; The response was very small, and it was clear that a much longer exposition was needed&amp;nbsp;— mostly to counter cultural bias. Ettinger correctly saw that people, even the intellectually, financially and socially distinguished, would have to be educated into understanding his belief that dying is usually gradual and could be a reversible process, and that [[freezing]] damage is so limited (even though fatal by present criteria) that its reversibility demands relatively little in future progress. Ettinger soon made an even more troubling discovery, principally that "a great many people have to be coaxed into admitting that life is better than death, healthy is better than sick, smart is better than stupid, and [[immortality]] might be worth the trouble!"&lt;ref name="regis87"/&gt;

In 1962, Ettinger privately published a preliminary version of ''The Prospect of Immortality'', in which he said that future technological advances could be used to bring people back to life. This finally attracted attention of a major publisher, which sent a copy to [[Isaac Asimov]]; Asimov said that the science behind cryonics was sound,&lt;ref name="mensa cryonics"/&gt; and the manuscript was approved for a 1964 [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] hardcover and various subsequent editions which launched cryonics.&lt;ref name="RCWE"/&gt; The book became a selection of the [[Book of the Month Club]] and was published in nine languages.&lt;ref name="mensa cryonics"/&gt;

Ettinger became an "overnight"&lt;ref name="regis87"/&gt; media celebrity, discussed in ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', ''[[Newsweek]]'', ''[[Paris Match]]'', ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', ''[[Christian Century]]'', and dozens of other periodicals. He appeared on television with [[David Frost]], [[Johnny Carson]], [[Steve Allen]], and others. Ettinger also spoke on radio programs coast-to-coast to promote the idea of human [[cryopreservation]].

Since the commercial publication of ''The Prospect of Immortality'', all those active in cryonics today can trace their involvement, directly or indirectly, to the publication of one or both of Ettinger's books.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} While Ettinger was the first, most articulate, and most scientifically credible person to argue the idea of cryonics,{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} he was not the only one. In 1962, [[Life Extension Society|Evan Cooper]] had authored a manuscript entitled [http://www.depressedmetabolism.com/pdfs/cooper_immortality.pdf Immortality: Scientifically, Physically, Now] under the pseudonym Nathan Duhring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Price |first = Michael |title = Subject: Ev Cooper |work = CryoMsg 23124 |publisher = CryoNet |date=December 17, 2003 |url = http://www.cryonet.org/cgi-bin/dsp.cgi?msg=23124  |accessdate = September 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cooper's book contained the same argument as did Ettinger's, but it lacked both scientific and technical rigor and was not of publication quality.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

==Organizational activities==
Following publication of ''The Prospect of Immortality'', Ettinger again waited for prominent scientists, industrialists, or others in authority to see the wisdom of his idea and begin implementing it. By contrast, Cooper was an activist and must be credited with forming the first cryonics organization (although the word "cryonics" was not to be coined until 1965) the [[Life Extension Society|Life Extension Society (LES)]]. LES advocated immediate action to implement human [[cryopreservation]] and established a nationwide network of chapters and coordinators to develop a [[grassroots]] capability for delivering cryopreservation on an emergent basis. Cooper left cryonics activism in 1969, and was lost at sea in 1983. But his activities with LES provided the basis for the formation of the first Cryonics Societies.

In 1966 the Cryonics Societies of California and Michigan were formed. Ettinger was elected President of the Cryonics Society of Michigan (CSM). In the 1970s CSM was transformed under the direction of Ettinger into the [[Cryonics Institute]] (CI) and the [[Immortalist Society]] (IS). In 1977, Ettinger's mother, Rhea Ettinger, became CI's first patient.&lt;ref&gt;http://cryonics.org/patients.html{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ettinger was President of both CI and IS until 2003.

'''Robert Leroy Johnson''' (May 8, 1911{{snd}}August 16, 1938) was an American [[blues]] singer-songwriter and musician. His landmark recordings in 1936 and 1937 display a combination of singing, guitar skills, and songwriting talent that has influenced later generations of musicians. Johnson's poorly documented life and death at age 27 have given rise to much legend. One [[Deal with the Devil|Faustian myth]] says that he sold his soul to the devil at a [[crossroads (mythology)|local crossroads]] of Mississippi highways to achieve success. As an [[wikt:Special:Search/itinerant|itinerant]] performer who played mostly on street corners, in [[juke joint]]s, and at Saturday night dances, Johnson had little commercial success or public recognition in his lifetime.

After the reissue of his recordings in 1961, on the LP ''[[King of the Delta Blues Singers]],'' his work reached a wider audience. Johnson is now recognized as a master of the blues, particularly of the Mississippi [[Delta blues]] style. He is credited by many rock musicians as an important influence; the blues and rock musician [[Eric Clapton]] has called Johnson "the most important blues singer that ever lived."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The 50 Albums That Changed Music |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/jul/16/popandrock.shopping |work=The Observer |location= |date=July 16, 2006 |accessdate=November 1, 2008  |postscript= &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;LaVere, Stephen (1990). Booklet accompanying ''Complete Recordings''. Sony Music Entertainment. p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in its first induction ceremony, in 1986, as an early influence on rock and roll.&lt;ref name="rockandroll_halloffame"&gt;[http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/robert-johnson "Robert Johnson Inducted at the 1986 Induction Ceremony"]. Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, [[David Fricke]] ranked Johnson fifth in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's "100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time".&lt;ref name="rs100"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-guitarists-of-all-time-19691231/robert-johnson-20101202 |title=100 Greatest Guitarists |work=Rolling Stone |date=December 10, 2010 |accessdate=August 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson was born in [[Hazlehurst, Mississippi]], possibly on May 8, 1911,&lt;ref name="Wardlow"&gt;Wardlow&lt;/ref&gt; to Julia Major Dodds (born October 1874) and Noah Johnson (born December 1884). Julia was married to Charles Dodds (born February 1865), a relatively prosperous landowner and furniture maker, with whom she had ten children. Charles Dodds had been forced by a [[Lynching in the United States|lynch]] mob to leave Hazlehurst following a dispute with white landowners. Julia left Hazlehurst with baby Robert, but after two years sent the boy to [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] to live with her husband, who had changed his name to Charles Spencer.&lt;ref&gt;Guralnik, pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Circa'' 1919, Robert rejoined his mother in the [[Mississippi Delta]] area, near [[Tunica, Mississippi|Tunica]] and [[Tunica Resorts, Mississippi|Robinsonville]]. They lived on the Abbay &amp; Leatherman Plantation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msbluestrail.org/blues-trail-markers/abbay-leatherman Mississippi Blues Trail]. Retrieved September 25, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Julia's new husband, known as Dusty Willis, was 24 years her junior. Robert was remembered by some residents as "Little Robert Dusty",&lt;ref&gt;Guralnik, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; but he was registered at Tunica's Indian Creek School as Robert Spencer. In the 1920 census, he is listed as Robert Spencer, living in [[Lucas, Arkansas]], with Will and Julia Willis. Robert was at school in 1924 and 1927.&lt;ref name="Freeland 2000"/&gt; The quality of his signature on his marriage certificate&lt;ref&gt;Wardlow 1998, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that he was relatively well educated for a boy of his background. A school friend, Willie Coffee, who was interviewed and filmed in later life, recalled that as a youth Robert was already noted for playing the harmonica and [[Jew's harp|jaw harp]].&lt;ref&gt;Mugge, Robert (2000). ''Hellhounds on My Trail: The Afterlife of Robert Johnson''. Quoted in Wald 2004, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; Coffee recalled that Robert was absent for long periods, which suggests that he may have been living and studying in Memphis.&lt;ref&gt;Pearson and McCulloch, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

After school, Robert adopted the surname of his natural father, signing himself as Robert Johnson on the certificate of his marriage to sixteen-year-old Virginia Travis in February 1929. She died in childbirth shortly after.&lt;ref&gt;Wald 2004, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; Surviving relatives of Virginia told the blues researcher [[Robert "Mack" McCormick]] that this was a divine punishment for Robert's decision to sing secular songs, known as "selling your soul to the Devil". McCormick believed that Johnson himself accepted the phrase as a description of his resolve to abandon the settled life of a husband and farmer to become a full-time blues musician.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''The Search for Robert Johnson'', 1992 film.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around this time, the blues musician [[Son House]] moved to Robinsonville, where his musical partner [[Willie Brown (musician)|Willie Brown]] lived. Late in life, House remembered Johnson as a "little boy" who was a competent harmonica player but an embarrassingly bad guitarist. Soon after, Johnson left Robinsonville for the area around Martinsville, close to his birthplace, possibly searching for his natural father. Here he perfected the guitar style of House and learned other styles from Isaiah "Ike" Zimmerman.&lt;ref name="Pearson &amp; McCulloch p. 7"&gt;Pearson and McCulloch, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Zimmerman was rumored to have learned supernaturally to play guitar by visiting graveyards at midnight.&lt;ref&gt;Pearson and McCulloch, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;
When Johnson next appeared in Robinsonville, he seemed to have miraculously acquired a guitar technique.&lt;ref&gt;Guralnick, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; House was interviewed at a time when the legend of Johnson's pact with the devil was well known among blues researchers. He was asked whether he attributed Johnson's technique to this pact, and his equivocal answers have been taken as confirmation.&lt;ref name="Wardlow" /&gt;

While living in Martinsville, Johnson fathered a child with Vergie Mae Smith. He married Caletta Craft in May 1931. In 1932, the couple moved to [[Clarksdale, Mississippi]], in the Delta. Caletta died in childbirth, and Johnson left for a career as a "walking" or itinerant musician.&lt;ref name="Pearson &amp; McCulloch p. 7"/&gt;

===Itinerant musician===
From 1932 until his death in 1938, Johnson moved frequently between the cities of [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] and [[Helena, Arkansas|Helena]], and the smaller towns of the Mississippi Delta and neighboring regions of Mississippi and Arkansas.&lt;ref&gt;Pearson and McCulloch, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gioia, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; On occasion, he traveled much farther. The blues musician [[Johnny Shines]] accompanied him to Chicago, Texas, New York, Canada, Kentucky, and Indiana.&lt;ref&gt;Neff and Connor, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Townsend (musician)|Henry Townsend]] shared a musical engagement with him in St. Louis.&lt;ref&gt;Townsend, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; In many places he stayed with members of his large extended family or with female friends.&lt;ref&gt;Guralnik, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; He did not marry again but formed some long-term relationships with women to whom he would return periodically. In other places he stayed with a woman he seduced at his first performance.&lt;ref&gt;Guralnik, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gioia, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; In each location, Johnson's hosts were largely ignorant of his life elsewhere. He used different names in different places, employing at least eight distinct surnames.&lt;ref&gt;Gioia, pp. 172–173.&lt;/ref&gt;

Biographers have looked for consistency from musicians who knew Johnson in different contexts: Shines, who traveled extensively with him; [[Robert Lockwood, Jr.]], who knew him as his mother's partner; [[David "Honeyboy" Edwards]], whose cousin Willie Mae Powell had a relationship with Johnson.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; From a mass of partial, conflicting, and inconsistent eyewitness accounts,&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; biographers have attempted to summarize Johnson's character. "He was well mannered, he was soft spoken, he was indecipherable".&lt;ref&gt;Guralnik, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; "As for his character, everyone seems to agree that, while he was pleasant and outgoing in public, in private he was reserved and liked to go his own way".&lt;ref&gt;Wald, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; "Musicians who knew Johnson testified that he was a nice guy and fairly average—except, of course, for his musical talent, his weakness for whiskey and women, and his commitment to the road."&lt;ref&gt;Pearson and McCulloch, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Johnson arrived in a new town, he would play for tips on street corners or in front of the local barbershop or a restaurant. Musical associates have said that in live performances Johnson often did not focus on his dark and complex original compositions, but instead pleased audiences by performing more well-known pop standards of the day&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE5D7113CF93BA15751C0A9629C8B63 | work=New York Times | title=Revisionists Sing New Blues History | first=Ben | last=Sisario | date=February 28, 2004 | accessdate=May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– and not necessarily blues. With an ability to pick up tunes at first hearing, he had no trouble giving his audiences what they wanted, and certain of his contemporaries later remarked on his interest in jazz and country music. He also had an uncanny ability to establish a rapport with his audience; in every town in which he stopped, he would establish ties to the local community that would serve him well when he passed through again a month or a year later.

Shines was 17 when he met Johnson in 1933. He estimated Johnson was maybe a year older than himself. Shines is quoted describing Johnson in Samuel Charters's ''Robert Johnson'':

{{quote|Robert was a very friendly person, even though he was sulky at times, you know. And I hung around Robert for quite a while. One evening he disappeared. He was kind of a peculiar fellow. Robert'd be standing up playing some place, playing like nobody's business. At about that time it was a hustle with him as well as a pleasure. And money'd be coming from all directions. But Robert'd just pick up and walk off and leave you standing there playing. And you wouldn't see Robert no more maybe in two or three weeks.&amp;nbsp;... So Robert and I, we began journeying off. I was just, matter of fact, tagging along.&lt;ref&gt;Charters&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During this time Johnson established what would be a relatively long-term relationship with Estella Coleman, a woman about 15 years his senior and the mother of the blues musician [[Robert Lockwood, Jr.]] Johnson reportedly cultivated a woman to look after him in each town he played in. He reputedly asked homely young women living in the country with their families whether he could go home with them, and in most cases he was accepted, until a boyfriend arrived or Johnson was ready to move on.

In 1941, [[Alan Lomax]] learned from [[Muddy Waters]] that Johnson had performed in the area around [[Clarksdale, Mississippi]].&lt;ref&gt;Lomax 1993&lt;/ref&gt; By 1959, the historian [[Samuel Charters]] could add only that [[Will Shade]], of the [[Memphis Jug Band]], remembered Johnson had once briefly played with him in [[West Memphis, Arkansas]].&lt;ref&gt;Charters 1959&lt;/ref&gt; In the last year of his life, Johnson is believed to have traveled to St. Louis and possibly Illinois and then to some states in the East. In 1938, [[Columbia Records]] producer [[John H. Hammond]], who owned some of Johnson's records, directed the record producer Don Law seek out Johnson to book him for the first "[[From Spirituals to Swing]]" concert at [[Carnegie Hall]] in New York. On learning of Johnson's death, Hammond replaced him with [[Big Bill Broonzy]], but he played two of Johnson's records from the stage.

}}
In Jackson, Mississippi, around 1936, Johnson sought out [[H. C. Speir]], who ran a general store and also acted as a talent scout. Speir put Johnson in touch with Ernie Oertle, who, as a salesman for the ARC group of labels, introduced Johnson to [[Don Law]] to record his first sessions in San Antonio, Texas. The recording session was held on November 23, 1936, in room 414 of the [[Gunter Hotel]] in San Antonio,&lt;ref&gt;"Blues Wizard's S.A. Legacy". ''San Antonio Express-News''. November 30, 1986. p. 1-J.&lt;/ref&gt; which Brunswick Records had set up to be a temporary recording studio. In the ensuing three-day session, Johnson played 16 selections and recorded alternate takes for most of them. He reportedly performed facing the wall, which has been cited as evidence he was a shy man and reserved performer. This conclusion was played up in the inaccurate liner notes of the 1961 album ''[[King of the Delta Blues Singers]]''. The [[slide guitarist]] [[Ry Cooder]] speculates that Johnson played facing a corner to enhance the sound of the guitar, a technique he calls "corner loading".&lt;ref&gt;Ry Cooder quoted in Guitar Player magazine, September 1990, p69, in article "The Real Robert Johnson" by Jas Obrecht&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the songs Johnson recorded in San Antonio were "[[Come On in My Kitchen]]", "[[Kind Hearted Woman Blues]]", "[[Dust My Broom|I Believe I'll Dust My Broom]]" and "[[Cross Road Blues]]". The first to be released were "[[Terraplane Blues]]" and "Last Fair Deal Gone Down", probably the only recordings of his that he would live to hear. "Terraplane Blues" became a modest regional hit, selling 5,000 copies.

His first recorded song, "Kind Hearted Woman Blues", was part of a cycle of spin-offs and response songs that began with [[Leroy Carr]]'s "Mean Mistreater Mama" (1934). According to [[Elijah Wald]], it was "the most musically complex in the cycle"&lt;ref name=Wald-131&gt;Wald 2004, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; and stood apart from most rural blues as a thoroughly composed lyric, rather than an arbitrary collection of more or less unrelated verses.&lt;ref&gt;Wald 2004, pp. 132– 176.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to most Delta players, Johnson had absorbed the idea of fitting a composed song into the three minutes of a 78-rpm side.&lt;ref&gt;Wald 2004, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of Johnson's "somber and introspective" songs and performances come from his second recording session.&lt;ref&gt;Wald 2004, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, Johnson traveled to Dallas, Texas, for another recording session with Don Law in a makeshift studio at the [[Vitagraph]] (Warner Brothers) Building, at 508 Park Avenue,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Chistensen, Thor| date=November 19, 2011| title=Dallas Church Preserving the Legacy of Robert Johnson| newspaper=New York Times| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/20/us/dallas-church-preserving-the-legacy-of-robert-johnson.html?_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt; where Brunswick Record Corporation was located on the third floor.&lt;ref&gt;''Eric Clapton&amp;nbsp;– Sessions for Robert Johnson''. Documentary, 2004. ''Worley's Dallas City Directory'', 1937.&lt;/ref&gt; Eleven records from this session would be released within the following year. Johnson did two takes of most of these songs, and recordings of those takes survived. Because of this, there is more opportunity to compare different performances of a single song by Johnson than for any other blues performer of his time and place.&lt;ref&gt;Wald 2004, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson recorded almost half of the 29 songs that make up his entire discography in [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]].

===Death===
{{see also|27 club}}
Johnson died on August 16, 1938, at the age of 27, near Greenwood, Mississippi, of unknown causes. Several differing accounts have described the events preceding his death. Johnson had been playing for a few weeks at a country dance in a town about {{convert|15|mi|km|0}} from Greenwood. According to one theory, Johnson was murdered by the jealous husband of a woman with whom he had flirted. In an account by the blues musician [[Sonny Boy Williamson II|Sonny Boy Williamson]], Johnson had been flirting with a married woman at a dance, and she gave him a bottle of whiskey poisoned by her husband. When Johnson took the bottle, Williamson knocked it out of his hand, admonishing him to never drink from a bottle that he had not personally seen opened. Johnson replied, "Don't ever knock a bottle out of my hand." Soon after, he was offered another (poisoned) bottle and accepted it. Johnson is reported to have begun feeling ill the evening after and had to be helped back to his room in the early morning hours. Over the next three days his condition steadily worsened. Witnesses reported that he died in a convulsive state of severe pain. The [[Musicology|musicologist]] [[Robert "Mack" McCormick]] claimed to have tracked down the man who murdered Johnson and to have obtained a confession from him in a personal interview, but he declined to reveal the man's name.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

While [[strychnine]] has been suggested as the poison that killed Johnson, at least one scholar has disputed the notion. Tom Graves, in his book ''Crossroads: The Life and Afterlife of Blues Legend Robert Johnson'', relies on expert testimony from toxicologists to argue that strychnine has such a distinctive odor and taste that it cannot be disguised, even in strong liquor. Graves also claims that a significant amount of strychnine would have to be consumed in one sitting to be fatal, and that death from the poison would occur within hours, not days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Crossroads: The Life and Afterlife of Blues Legend Robert Johnson|first=Tom |last=Graves|first2= Steve |last2=LaVere|publisher=Demers Books|year=2008 |pages=39–43 |url= |isbn=978-0-9816002-0-8 |quote=The tale most often told about how Johnson met his fate is that he was poisoned by a jealous husband who put strychnine in his whiskey.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- for whole para so far--&gt; Johnson's contemporary David "Honeyboy" Edwards similarly noted that the poison could not have been strychnine, since Johnson would have died much more rapidly, instead of suffering for three days.
{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}}

The LeFlore County registrar, Cornelia Jordan, after conducting an investigation into Johnson's death for the state director of vital statistics, R. N. Whitfield, wrote on Johnson's death certificate:

 &lt;blockquote&gt;I talked with the white man on whose place this negro died and I also talked with a negro woman on the place. The plantation owner said the negro man, seemingly about 26 years old, came from Tunica two or three weeks before he died to play banjo at a negro dance given there on the plantation. He stayed in the house with some of the negroes saying he wanted to pick cotton. The white man did not have a doctor for this negro as he had not worked for him. He was buried in a homemade coffin furnished by the county. The plantation owner said it was his opinion that the man died of syphilis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blues.jfrewald.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/cert_back.jpg|format=JPG|title=Handwritten note on the back of Johnson's death certificate|publisher=Blues.Jfrewald.com|accessdate=2015-09-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305144848/http://blues.jfrewald.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/cert_back.jpg|archivedate=March 5, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Gravesite===
[[File:TombstoneRobert Johnson.jpg|thumb|Alleged gravesite with one of Johnson's three tombstones]]
The exact location of Johnson's grave is officially unknown; three different markers have been erected at possible sites in church cemeteries outside Greenwood.
* Research in the 1980s and 1990s strongly suggests Johnson was buried in the graveyard of the Mount Zion Missionary Baptist Church near Morgan City, Mississippi, not far from Greenwood, in an unmarked grave. A one-ton [[cenotaph]] in the shape of an obelisk, listing all of Johnson's song titles, with a central inscription by [[Peter Guralnick]], was placed at this location in 1990, paid for by Columbia Records and numerous smaller contributions made through the [[Mt. Zion Memorial Fund]].
* In 1990, a small marker with the epitaph "Resting in the Blues" was placed in the cemetery of Payne Chapel, near Quito, Mississippi, by an Atlanta rock group named the Tombstones, after they saw a photograph in ''Living Blues'' magazine of an unmarked spot alleged by one of Johnson's ex-girlfriends to be Johnson's burial site.&lt;ref&gt;Cheseborough, Steve (2008). ''Blues Traveling: The Holy Sites of Delta Blues''. University Press of Mississippi. pp. 145–146. {{ISBN|1604733284}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* More recent{{when|date=May 2018}} research by Stephen LaVere (including statements from Rosie Eskridge, the wife of the supposed gravedigger) indicates that the actual grave site is under a big pecan tree in the cemetery of the Little Zion Church, north of Greenwood along Money Road. Through LaVere, Sony Music placed a marker at this site, which bears LaVere's name as well as Johnson's.

John Hammond, Jr., in the documentary ''[[The Search for Robert Johnson]]'' (1991), suggests that owing to poverty and lack of transportation Johnson is most likely to have been buried in a pauper's grave (or "[[potter's field]]") very near where he died.

==Devil legend==
According to legend, as a young man living on a plantation in rural Mississippi, Johnson had a tremendous desire to become a great blues musician. He was instructed to take his guitar to a crossroad near [[Dockery Plantation]] at midnight. There he was met by a large black man (the devil) who took the guitar and tuned it. The devil played a few songs and then returned the guitar to Johnson, giving him mastery of the instrument. This was a deal with the devil mirroring the legend of [[Faust]]. In exchange for his soul, Johnson was able to create the blues for which he became famous.

===Various accounts===
This legend was developed over time and has been chronicled by [[Gayle Dean Wardlow]],&lt;ref&gt;Wardlow, pp. 196–201.&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Komara&lt;ref&gt;Wardlow, pp. 203–204.&lt;/ref&gt; and Elijah Wald, who sees the legend as largely dating from Johnson's rediscovery by white fans more than two decades after his death.&lt;ref&gt;Wald, pp. 265–276.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Son House]] once told the story to [[Pete Welding]] as an explanation of Johnson's astonishingly rapid mastery of the guitar. Welding reported it as a serious belief in a widely read article in ''[[Down Beat]]'' in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;Whelan&lt;/ref&gt; Other interviewers failed to elicit any confirmation from House and there were fully two years between House's observation of Johnson as first a novice and then a master.

Further details were absorbed from the imaginative retellings by [[Greil Marcus]]&lt;ref&gt;Marcus 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Robert Palmer (writer)|Robert Palmer]].&lt;ref&gt;Palmer 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; Most significantly, the detail was added that Johnson received his gift from a large black man at a crossroads. There is dispute as to how and when the crossroads detail was attached to the Robert Johnson story. All the published evidence, including a full chapter on the subject in the biography ''Crossroads'', by Tom Graves, suggests an origin in the story of the blues musician [[Tommy Johnson (musician)|Tommy Johnson]]. This story was collected from his musical associate [[Ishman Bracey]] and his elder brother Ledell in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Wardlow 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; One version of Ledell Johnson's account was published in [[David Evans (musicologist)|David Evans]]'s 1971 biography of Tommy Johnson,&lt;ref&gt;Evans 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; and was repeated in print in 1982 alongside House's story in the widely read ''Searching for Robert Johnson'', by Peter Guralnick.&lt;ref&gt;Guralnik 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

In another version, Ledell placed the meeting not at a crossroads but in a graveyard. This resembles the story told to Steve LaVere that Ike Zinnerman of [[Hazlehurst, Mississippi]], learned to play the guitar at midnight while sitting on tombstones. Zinnerman is believed to have influenced the playing of the young Johnson.&lt;ref&gt;Wardlow 1998, p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:ClarksdaleMS Crossroads.jpg|right|thumb|The legendary crossroads at Clarksdale, Mississippi]] Recent research by the blues scholar [[Bruce Conforth]], in ''[[Living Blues]]'' magazine, makes the story clearer. Johnson and Ike Zimmerman (the spelling reportedly given in census records for the family going back to the early 1800s, on his Social Security card and Social Security death notice, on his funeral program, and by his daughters) did practice in a graveyard at night, because it was quiet and no one would disturb them, but it was not the Hazlehurst cemetery as had been believed: Zimmerman was not from Hazlehurst but nearby [[Beauregard, Mississippi|Beauregard]], and he didn't practice in one graveyard, but in several in the area.&lt;ref&gt;''Living Blues'' 39:1 (issue 194), February 2008. pp. 68–73.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson spent about a year living with and learning from Zimmerman, who ultimately accompanied Johnson back to the Delta to look after him.

While Dockery, Hazlehurst and Beauregard have each been claimed as the locations of the mythical crossroads, there are also tourist attractions claiming to be "The Crossroads" in both Clarksdale and Memphis.&lt;ref&gt;Wardlow 1998, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; Residents of [[Rosedale, Mississippi]], claim Johnson sold his soul to the devil at the intersection of Highways 1 and 8 in their town, while the 1986 movie ''[[Crossroads (1986 film)|Crossroads]]'' was filmed in [[Beulah, Mississippi]]. The blues historian Steve Cheseborough wrote that it may be impossible to discover the exact location of the mythical crossroads, because "Robert Johnson was a rambling guy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Cheseborough | first = Steve | title = Blues Traveling: The Holy Sites of Delta Blues | publisher = University Press of Mississippi | edition = 3rd | year = 2008 | page = 83 | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interpretations===
Some scholars have argued that the devil in these songs may refer not only to the Christian figure of Satan but also to the African trickster god [[Papa Legba|Legba]], himself associated with crossroads. Folklorist Harry M. Hyatt wrote that, during his research in the South from 1935 to 1939, when African-Americans born in the 19th or early 20th century said they or anyone else had "sold their soul to the devil at the crossroads," they had a different meaning in mind. Hyatt claimed there was evidence indicating African religious retentions surrounding Legba and the making of a "deal" (not selling the soul in the same sense as in the Faustian tradition cited by Graves) with the so-called devil at the crossroads.&lt;ref&gt;Hyatt, Harry (1973). ''Hoodoo–Conjuration–Witchcraft–Rootwork, Beliefs Accepted by Many Negroes and White Persons''. Western Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The Blues and the Blues singer has really special powers over women, especially.  It is said that the Blues singer could possess women and have any woman they wanted. And so when Robert Johnson came back, having left his community as an apparently mediocre musician, with a clear genius in his guitar style and lyrics, people said he must have sold his soul to the devil.  And that fits in with this old African association with the crossroads where you find wisdom: you go down to the crossroads to learn, and in his case to learn in a Faustian pact, with the devil. You sell your soul to become the greatest musician in history.&lt;ref name="Ferris"&gt;Ferris, Bill. ''[[The Story with Dick Gordon]]''. [[American Public Media]].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This view that the devil in Johnson's songs is derived from an African deity was disputed by the blues scholar [[David Evans (musicologist)|David Evans]] in an essay published in 1999, "Demythologizing the Blues":

{{quote|There are&amp;nbsp;... several serious problems with this crossroads myth. The devil imagery found in the blues is thoroughly familiar from western folklore, and nowhere do blues singers ever mention Legba or any other African deity in their songs or other lore. The actual African music connected with cults of Legba and similar trickster deities sounds nothing like the blues, but rather features polyrhythmic percussion and choral call-and-response singing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = Demythologizing the Blues| author = Evans, David| date = October 22, 1999| journal = Institute for Studies in American Music Newsletter}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The musicologist [[Alan Lomax]] dismissed the myth, stating, "In fact, every blues fiddler, banjo picker, harp blower, piano strummer and guitar framer was, in the opinion of both himself and his peers, a child of the Devil, a consequence of the black view of the European dance embrace as sinful in the extreme".&lt;ref&gt;Lomax, p. 365.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical style==
Johnson is considered a master of the blues, particularly of the Delta blues style. [[Keith Richards]], of the [[Rolling Stones]], said in 1990, "You want to know how good the blues can get? Well, this is it." But according to [[Elijah Wald]], in his book ''Escaping the Delta'', Johnson in his own time was most respected for his ability to play in a wide range of styles, from raw country [[slide guitar]] to jazz and pop licks, and for his ability to pick up guitar parts almost instantly upon hearing a song.&lt;ref&gt;Wald 2004, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; His first recorded song, "Kind Hearted Woman Blues", in contrast to the prevailing Delta style of the time, more resembled the style of [[Chicago blues|Chicago]] or [[St. Louis blues (music)|St. Louis]], with "a full-fledged, abundantly varied musical arrangement".&lt;ref&gt;Wald 2004, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; Unusual for a Delta player of the time, a recording exhibits what Johnson could do entirely outside of a blues style. "They're Red Hot", from his first recording session, shows that he was also comfortable with an "uptown" [[swing music|swing]] or [[ragtime]] sound similar to that of the [[Harlem Hamfats]], but as Wald remarked, "no record company was heading to Mississippi in search of a down-home [[Ink Spots]] ... [H]e could undoubtedly have come up with a lot more songs in this style if the producers had wanted them."&lt;ref&gt;Wald 2004, pp. 152–154.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voice===
An important aspect of Johnson's singing was his use of [[microtonal music|microtonality]]. These subtle inflections of [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] help explain why his singing conveys such powerful emotion. [[Eric Clapton]] described Johnson's music as "the most powerful cry that I think you can find in the human voice". In two takes of "Me and the Devil Blues" he shows a high degree of precision in the complex vocal delivery of the last verse: "The range of tone he can pack into a few lines is astonishing."&lt;ref&gt;Wald 2004, pp. 178–179.&lt;/ref&gt; The song's "hip humor and sophistication" is often overlooked. "[G]enerations of blues writers in search of wild Delta primitivism", wrote Wald, have been inclined to overlook or undervalue aspects that show Johnson as a polished professional performer.&lt;ref name=Wald-177/&gt;

Johnson is also known for using the guitar as "the other vocalist in the song", a technique later perfected by [[B. B. King]] and his personified guitar named [[Lucille (guitar)|Lucille]]: "In Africa and in Afro-American tradition, there is the tradition of the talking instrument, beginning with the drums&amp;nbsp;... the one-strand and then the six-strings with bottleneck-style performance; it becomes a competing voice&amp;nbsp;...or a complementary voice&amp;nbsp;... in the performance."&lt;ref name="Ferris"/&gt;

|quote=When Johnson started singing, he seemed like a guy who could have sprung from the head of Zeus in full armor. I immediately differentiated between him and anyone else I had ever heard. The songs weren't customary blues songs. They were so utterly fluid. At first they went by quick, too quick to even get. They jumped all over the place in range and subject matter, short punchy verses that resulted in some panoramic story-fires of mankind blasting off the surface of this spinning piece of plastic.&lt;ref name="Dylan"&gt;{{cite book| title=[[Chronicles: Volume One]]| last=Dylan| first= Bob| authorlink=Bob Dylan| publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster| year=2004| isbn=0-7432-2815-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;|source= — [[Bob Dylan]]}}

===Instrument===
Johnson mastered the guitar, being considered today one of the all-time greats on the instrument. His approach was complex and musically advanced. When [[Keith Richards]] was first introduced to Johnson's music by his bandmate [[Brian Jones]], he asked, "Who is the other guy playing with him?", not realizing it was Johnson playing one guitar. "I was hearing two guitars, and it took a long time to actually realise he was doing it all by himself",&lt;ref name="Buncombe"&gt;{{cite journal| title=The Grandfather of Rock'n'Roll: The Devil's Instrument| last=Buncombe| first=Andrew| journal=[[The Independent]]| date=July 26, 2006| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/the-grandfather-of-rocknroll-the-devils-instrument-409317.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; said Richards, who later stated that "Robert Johnson was like an orchestra all by himself".&lt;ref name="Myers"/&gt; "As for his guitar technique, it's politely reedy but ambitiously eclectic—moving effortlessly from hen-picking and bottleneck slides to a full deck of chucka-chucka rhythm figures."&lt;ref name="Myers"/&gt;

===Lyrics===
In ''[[The Story with Dick Gordon]]'', Bill Ferris, of [[American Public Media]], said, "Robert Johnson I think of in the same way I think of the British [[Romanticism|Romantic]] poets, [[John Keats|Keats]] and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]], who burned out early, who were geniuses at wordsmithing poetry&amp;nbsp;... The Blues, if anything, are deeply sexual. You know, 'my car doesn't run, I'm gonna check my oil'&amp;nbsp;... 'if you don't like my apples, don't shake my tree'. Every verse has sexuality associated with it."&lt;ref name="Ferris"/&gt;

===Playback speed hypothesis===

In ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s music blog from May 2010, Jon Wilde speculated that Johnson's recordings may have been "accidentally speeded up when first committed to 78 [rpm records], or else were deliberately speeded up to make them sound more exciting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Robert Johnson Revelation Tells Us to Put the Brakes on the Blues | author=Wilde, Jon | work=The Guardian | url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2010/may/27/robert-johnson-blues | date=May 27, 2010 | accessdate=June 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did not give a source for this statement. Biographer [[Elijah Wald]] and other musicologists dispute this hypothesis on various grounds, including that Johnson's extant recordings were made on five different days, spread across two years at two different studios, making uniform speed changes or malfunctions highly improbable.&lt;ref name="Wald"&gt;{{cite web | title=The Robert Johnson Recording Speed Controversy | author=Wald, Elijah | url=http://www.elijahwald.com/johnsonspeed.html | accessdate=August 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, fellow musicians, contemporaries and family who worked with or witnessed Johnson perform spoke of his recordings for more than 70 years preceding Wilde's hypothesis without ever suggesting that the speed of his performances had been altered.&lt;ref name="Wald"/&gt;

==Influences==
Johnson fused approaches specific to Delta blues to those from the broader music world. The slide guitar work on "Rambling on My Mind" is pure Delta and Johnson's vocal there has "a touch of&amp;nbsp;... Son House rawness", but the train imitation on the bridge is not at all typical of Delta blues—it is more like something out of [[minstrel show]] music or [[vaudeville]].&lt;ref&gt;Wald 2004, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson did record versions of "Preaching the Blues" and "Walking Blues" in the older bluesman's vocal and guitar style (House's chronology has been questioned by Guralnick). As with the first take of "Come On in My Kitchen", the influence of Skip James is evident in James's "Devil Got My Woman", but the lyrics rise to the level of first-rate poetry, and Johnson sings with a strained voice found nowhere else in his recorded output.&lt;ref&gt;Wald 2004, pp. 171–172.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sad, romantic "Love in Vain" successfully blends several of Johnson's disparate influences. The form, including the wordless last verse, follows Leroy Carr's last hit "When the Sun Goes Down"; the words of the last sung verse come directly from a song [[Blind Lemon Jefferson]] recorded in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;Wald 2004, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt;  Johnson's last recording, "Milkcow's Calf Blues" is his most direct tribute to Kokomo Arnold, who wrote "Milkcow Blues" and influenced Johnson's vocal style.&lt;ref&gt;Wald 2004, p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[From Four Until Late]]" shows Johnson's mastery of a blues style not usually associated with the Delta. He [[crooner|croons]] the lyrics in a manner reminiscent of [[Lonnie Johnson (musician)|Lonnie Johnson]], and his guitar style is more that of a [[ragtime]]-influenced player like [[Blind Blake]].&lt;ref name=Wald-170-171&gt;Wald 2004, pp. 170–171, 174.&lt;/ref&gt; Lonnie Johnson's influence is even clearer in two other departures from the usual Delta style: "Malted Milk" and "Drunken Hearted Man". Both copy the arrangement of Lonnie Johnson's "Life Saver Blues".&lt;ref&gt;Wald 2004, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;  The two takes of "Me and the Devil Blues" show the influence of [[Peetie Wheatstraw]], calling into question the interpretation of this piece as "the spontaneous heart-cry of a demon-driven folk artist".&lt;ref name=Wald-177&gt;Wald 2004, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, Yazoo Records released ''The Roots of Robert Johnson'', a compilation CD of Delta blues recordings (including several of those cited here) which pre-date Johnson and illustrate how his blues output was influenced.

==Legacy==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2017}}
Johnson has had enormous impact on music and musicians, but outside his own time and place and even the genre for which he was famous. His influence on contemporaries was much smaller, in part because he was an itinerant performer—playing mostly on street corners, in [[juke joint]]s, and at Saturday night dances—who worked in a then undervalued style of music. He also died young after recording only a handful of songs. Johnson, though well-traveled and admired in his performances, was little noted in his lifetime, and his records were even less appreciated. "[[Terraplane Blues]]", sometimes described as Johnson's only hit record, outsold his others, but was still only a minor success.

If one had asked black blues fans about Johnson in the first twenty years after his death, writes [[Elijah Wald]], "the response in the vast majority of cases would have been a puzzled 'Robert who?'" This lack of recognition extended to black musicians: "As far as the evolution of black music goes, Robert Johnson was an extremely minor figure, and very little that happened in the decades following his death would have been affected if he had never played a note".&lt;ref&gt;Wald 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Columbia Records]] released the album ''[[King of the Delta Blues Singers]]'', a compilation of Johnson's recordings, in 1961, which introduced his work to a much wider audience—fame and recognition he only received long after his death.

===Rock and roll===
Johnson's greatest influence has been on genres of music that developed after his death: [[rock and roll]] and rock. The [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] included four of his songs in a set of 500&lt;ref name=500STS&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.rockhall.com/exhibithighlights/500-songs| title = 500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll| website = Exhibit Highlights| publisher = [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]| year = 1995| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070502032502/http://www.rockhall.com/exhibithighlights/500-songs| archivedate = May 2, 2007| accessdate = | deadurl = yes| df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; they deemed to have shaped the genre:
* "[[Sweet Home Chicago]]" (1936)
* "[[Cross Road Blues]]" (1936)
* "[[Hellhound on My Trail]]" (1937)
* "[[Love in Vain]]" (1937)

Johnson recorded these songs a decade and a half before the [[Origins of rock and roll|advent of rock and roll]], dying a year or two later. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inducted him as an early influence in its first induction ceremony, in 1986, almost a half century after his death. Marc Meyers, of the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', wrote that "His 'Stop Breakin' Down Blues' from 1937 is so far ahead of its time that the song could easily have been a rock demo cut in 1954."&lt;ref name="Myers"/&gt;

===Rock music and related genres===
Many of the artists who claim to have been influenced by Johnson the most, injecting his revolutionary stylings into their work and recording tribute songs and collections, are prominent rock musicians from the United Kingdom. His impact on these musicians—who contributed to and helped to define [[rock and roll]] and rock music—came from the compilation of his works released in 1961 by Columbia Records (''[[King of the Delta Blues Singers]]'').

[[Brian Jones]], of [[the Rolling Stones]], introduced his bandmate Keith Richards to this album by Johnson. The blues master's recordings would have as much impact on him as on [[Mick Jagger]]. The group performed his "[[Walkin' Blues]]" at the [[Rock and Roll Circus]] in 1968. They arranged their own version of "[[Love in Vain]]" for their album ''[[Let It Bleed]]'' and recorded "[[Stop Breakin' Down Blues]]" for ''[[Exile on Main Street]]''. Jagger, in the role of Turner in the 1970 film ''[[Performance (film)|Performance]]'', performed excerpts from "[[Come On in My Kitchen]]" and "[[Me and the Devil Blues]]".

[[Alexis Korner]], who has been called "the Founding Father of British Blues", co-wrote and recorded a song entitled "Robert Johnson" for ''[[The Party Album (Alexis Korner)|The Party Album]]'', released in 1978. Other examples of the influence he had on English blues and [[Blues rock|blues-rock]] musicians and musical groups include the following:
* [[Eric Clapton]] considers Johnson "the most important blues musician who ever lived".&lt;ref name="Buncombe"/&gt; He recorded enough of his songs to make ''[[Me and Mr. Johnson]]'', a blues-rock album released in 2004 as a tribute to the legendary bluesman (it was also used in the film ''Sessions for Robert J''). He earlier recorded "Crossroads", an arrangement of "[[Cross Road Blues]]", with [[Cream (band)|Cream]] in 1968, leading some to consider him "the man largely responsible for making Robert Johnson a household name."&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.npr.org/local/stories/KPLU/149258634 Bo Diddley's 'Before You Accuse Me' Influential as the Master]. ''Listen to the Story''. KPLU 88.5. March 23, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Robert Plant]], of [[Led Zeppelin]], referred to Johnson on the [[National Public Radio|NPR]] radio program ''Fresh Air'' (recorded in 2004) as "Robert Johnson, to whom we all owed our existence, in some way." His group recorded "[[Traveling Riverside Blues]]", a song that drew from Johnson's original and quoted a number of his songs; the accompanying music video showed images from the Delta, which Johnson often wrote about.
* [[Fleetwood Mac]] was strongly influenced by Johnson in the group's early years as a British blues band. Guitarist [[Jeremy Spencer]] contributed two covers of Johnson-derived songs to the group's early albums, and lead guitarist [[Peter Green (musician)|Peter Green]] later recorded Johnson's entire catalogue in two albums, ''[[The Robert Johnson Songbook]]'' and ''[[Hot Foot Powder (album)|Hot Foot Powder]]''.
* [[Sam Dunn]]'s documentary ''[[Metal Evolution]]'' cites Johnson as the "great grandfather to all things heavy metal", with members of the bands [[Rush (band)|Rush]] and [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]] agreeing that he played a major role in the development of rock music.
* [[Bob Dylan]] wrote of Johnson in his 2004 autobiography ''[[Chronicles: Volume One]]'', "If I hadn't heard the Robert Johnson record when I did, there probably would have been hundreds of lines of mine that would have been shut down—that I wouldn't have felt free enough or upraised enough to write."&lt;ref name="Dylan"/&gt;

===Guitar technique===
[[File:Robert-Johnson-Gibson L1.jpg|alt=|thumb|[[Gibson L-1]] guitar, subsequently reissued by Gibson as a tribute to Johnson]]
Johnson's revolutionary guitar playing has led contemporary critics, assessing his talents through the handful of old recordings available, to rate him among the greatest guitar players of all time:
* In 1990, ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] magazine'' rated him first in its list of "35 Guitar Gods"—on the 52nd anniversary of his death.&lt;ref&gt;"35 Guitar Gods". ''Spin''. August 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2008, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked him fifth on their list of "100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time"—70 years after he died.&lt;ref name="rs100"/&gt;
* In 2010, Guitar.com ranked him ninth in its list of "Top 50 Guitarists of All Time"—72 years after he died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gibson.com/en-us/Lifestyle/Features/Top-50-Guitarists-528/title=Gibson.com|title=Top 50 Guitarists of All Time&amp;nbsp;– 10 to 1|publisher=Gibson.com|accessdate=June 3, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513051157/http://www.gibson.com/en-us/Lifestyle/Features/Top-50-Guitarists-528/title=Gibson.com|archive-date=May 13, 2011|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Musicians who proclaim Johnson's profound impact on them—including Keith Richards, [[Jimi Hendrix]], and Eric Clapton—all rated in the top ten with him on each of these lists. The [[boogie woogie|boogie]] [[bass line]] he fashioned for "[[I Believe I'll Dust My Broom]]" has now passed into the standard guitar repertoire. At the time it was completely new, a guitarist's version of something people would otherwise have heard only from a piano.&lt;ref name=Wald-136&gt;Wald 2004, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lifetime achievement===
''[[The Complete Recordings (Robert Johnson album)|The Complete Recordings]]'', a double-disc boxed set released by [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony/Columbia Legacy]] on August 28, 1990, containing almost everything Johnson ever recorded, with all 29 recordings and 12 alternate takes, won a [[Grammy Award]] for "Best Historical Album" that year. In 2006 Johnson was awarded a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award (accepted by his son Claud).

==Problems of biography==
{{Quote box |quote=The thing about Robert Johnson was that he only existed on his records. He was pure legend.|source=–[[Martin Scorsese]], ''Love in Vain: A Vision of Robert Johnson''|align=right |width=30% |salign=right}}

Very little of Johnson's early life is known with certainty. Two marriage licenses for Johnson have been located in county records offices. The ages given in these certificates point to different birth dates, as do the entries showing his attendance at Indian Creek School, in Tunica, Mississippi. That he was not listed among his mother's children in the [[1910 United States Census|1910 census]]&lt;ref name="Freeland 2000"&gt;Freeland 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; casts further doubt on these dates. Carrie Thompson claimed that her mother, who was also Robert's mother, remembered his birth date as May&amp;nbsp;8, 1911. The [[1920 United States Census|1920 census]] gives his age as 7, suggesting he was born in 1912 or 1913.&lt;ref name="rewald"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tdblues.com/2009/10/new-robert-johnson-census-records/|title=New Robert Johnson Census Records|last=Rewald|first=Jason|date=October 9, 2009|work=tdblues.com|accessdate=5 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130713033235/http://www.tdblues.com/2009/10/new-robert-johnson-census-records/|archive-date=July 13, 2013|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five significant dates from his career are documented: Monday, Thursday and Friday, November 23, 26, and 27, 1936, at a recording session in San Antonio, Texas; and Saturday and Sunday, June 19 and 20, 1937, at a recording session in Dallas. His death certificate, discovered in 1968, lists the date and location of his death.&lt;ref&gt;Wardlow and Komara 1998, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson's records were admired by record collectors from the time of their first release, and efforts were made to discover his biography, with virtually no success. The blues researcher [[Mack McCormick]] began researching his family background but was never ready to publish his findings. McCormick's research eventually became as much a legend as Johnson himself. In 1982, McCormick permitted [[Peter Guralnick]] to publish a summary in ''Living Blues'' (1982), later reprinted in book form as ''Searching for Robert Johnson''.&lt;ref&gt;Guralnick&lt;/ref&gt; Later research has sought to confirm this account or to add minor details. A revised summary acknowledging major informants was written by Stephen LaVere for the booklet accompanying the [[compilation album]] ''[[The Complete Recordings (Robert Johnson album)|Robert Johnson, The Complete Recordings]]'' (1990), and is maintained with updates at the Delta Haze website.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.deltahaze.com/johnson/bio.html |title=Robert Johnson&amp;nbsp;– Bio

These published biographical sketches achieve coherent narratives, partly by ignoring reminiscences and hearsay accounts which contradict or conflict with other accounts.

A relatively full account of Johnson's brief musical career emerged in the 1960s, largely from accounts by Son House, Johnny Shines, David Honeyboy Edwards and Robert Lockwood. In 1961, the sleeve notes to the album ''[[King of the Delta Blues Singers]]'' included reminiscences of [[Don Law]] who had recorded Johnson in 1936. Law added to the mystique surrounding Johnson, representing him as very young and extraordinarily shy.

===Photographs===
The two confirmed images of Johnson were located in 1973, in the possession of his half-sister Carrie Thompson, but were not widely published until the late 1980s. A third photo, purporting to show Johnson posing with the blues musician [[Johnny Shines]], was published in the November 2008 issue of ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;Digiacomo, Frank (2008).

This photograph has never been made public.

===Descendants===
Johnson left no [[Will and testament|will]]. In 1998, the [[Mississippi Supreme Court]] ruled that Claud Johnson, a retired truck driver living in [[Crystal Springs, Mississippi]], was the son of Robert Johnson and his sole heir.  The court heard that he had been born to Virgie Jane Smith (later Virgie Jane Cain), who had a relationship with Robert Johnson in 1931.  The relationship was attested to by a friend, Eula Mae Williams, but other relatives descended from Robert Johnson's half-sister, Carrie Harris Thompson, contested Claud Johnson's claim. The effect of the judgment was to allow Claud Johnson to receive over $1 million in royalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Court Rules Father of the Blues Has a Son | publisher=New York Times | author=Bragg, Rick | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/17/us/court-rules-father-of-the-blues-has-a-son.html | accessdate=September 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claud Johnson died, aged 83, on June 30, 2015, leaving six children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Claud Johnson, Son of Blues Singer, Dies at 83 | publisher=New York Times | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/02/arts/music/claud-johnson-83-son-of-blues-singer.html?_r=0 | accessdate=September 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other Robert Johnsons ===
The [[Radiolab]] podcast "Crossroads", broadcast initially April 16, 2012, on [[VPR|NPR]], raises the possibility that more than one Robert Johnson was traveling around the region making music at the time of the subject's life — perhaps confusing related biographical information. Producers of the show spoke with Tom Graves, Elijah Wald, David Evans, and [[Mack McCormick|Robert "Mack" McCormick]] to support this theory. The death certificate attributed to Johnson, for example, indicates on the reverse side that (possibly another) Robert Johnson came to the area to play ''[[banjo]]'' (not guitar) and died of [[syphilis]]. This could help explain some of the confusion surrounding Johnson's cause of death.

Johnson was also reportedly seen twice after his supposed death, once in 1939 and another time in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiolab.org/story/199705-crossroads/|title=Crossroads|date=16 April 2012|accessdate=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tapes of a Ledell Johnson (no relation), indicate an intention to spin a devil-at-the-crossroads story — one that may have transferred somehow to Johnson.

'''SS ''Isaac M. Scott''''' was an [[United States|American]] [[Great Lakes freighter|Great Lakes Freighter]] that sunk during the [[Great Lakes Storm of 1913]] in [[Lake Huron]], 6 to 7 miles northeast of Thunder Bay Island ({{coord|45|03|N|83|02|W|display=inline, title}}), while she was traveling from [[Cleveland, OH|Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], [[United States]] to [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States]] with a cargo of [[Coal]].&lt;ref name=WSM&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?158894 |title=SS Isaac M. Scott |publisher=Wrecksite |date= |accessdate=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction ==
''Isaac M. Scott'' was built in 1909 at the American Shipbuilding Co. shipyard in [[Lorain, Ohio|Lorain]], Ohio, USA and launched on 12 June 1909. She was completed on 2 July 1909. Named for the president of the La Belle Iron Works, she served from 12 July 1909 until her demise on 11 November 1913.
The ship was {{convert|159.7|m|ftin}} long, with a beam of {{convert|16.5|m|ftin}} and a draft of {{convert|9.1|m|ftin}}. The ship was assessed at {{GRT|6,372}}. She had a triple-expansion steam engine driving a single screw propeller. At the time of her completion the Toledo Blade called her ''One of the handsomest of the large freighters on the great lakes.''&lt;ref name=ZSM&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thunderbay.noaa.gov/shipwrecks/scott.html |title=Isaac M. Scott |publisher=thunderbay.noaa.gov |date=13 February 2013 |accessdate=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Maiden Voyage Disaster ==
''Isaac M. Scott'''s maiden voyage was marred by tragedy. At 4:00 AM on 12 July 1909, while traveling northwest about 2 miles off the Whitefish Point lighthouse in a dense fog, the ''Isaac M. Scott'' rammed the [[SS John B. Cowle (1902)|SS ''John B. Cowle'']]. The ''John B. Cowle'' sank within a few minutes taking 14 of her 24 crewmen with her to the bottom. The survivors were picked up by the ''Isaac M. Scott'' and taken back to port. The ''Isaac M. Scott'' suffered damage to about 25 plates, which cost $30,000 in repairs.

In March 1910, the Virginia Steamship Company settled claims filed by relatives of men lost in the sinking of the ''[[SS John B. Cowle (1902)|John B. Cowle]]'' in the amount of $20,000. Following an investigation and hearings, the United States Steamboat Inspectors at Marquette suspended Captain Rogers and Edward E. Carlton, Pilot, of the ''[[SS John B. Cowle (1902)|John B. Cowle]]'' for 30 days ruling that the ''[[SS John B. Cowle (1902)|John B. Cowle]]'' and the ''Isaac M. Scott'' were sailing too fast for the weather conditions and that the ''[[SS John B. Cowle (1902)|John B. Cowle]]'' had failed to properly signal. F. W. Wertheimer, Pilot of the ''Isaac M. Scott''. The ''Isaac M. Scott'' was subsequently beached for one year.&lt;ref name=ZSA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.us-data.org/mi/glm/shipwrecks/isaac-m-scott/ |title=Isaac M. Scott |publisher= |date=28 April 2013 |accessdate=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Great Lakes Storm Of 1913 And Sinking ==
In the pre-dawn hours of 9 November 1913, the ''Isaac M. Scott'', loaded with a cargo of coal worth $22,000 bound for [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States]] left Port Huron, [[Cleveland, OH|Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], [[United States]] for the last time. She was one of several big freighters that passed out of the St. Clair River into [[Lake Huron]] and straight into the path of the deadliest storm in the [[Great Lakes]] history. Captain A. McArthur had been master of the ''Isaac M. Scott'' since her maiden voyage back in 1909 and sailed with 27 other men on the ''Isaac M. Scott''s last voyage. Had he known how ugly the weather was about to become he surely would have never left port.
 
On Sunday 9 November 1913 at around 10:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. the ''H. B. Hawgood'' was running before the storm when they spotted the ''Isaac M. Scott'', still heading North and making heavy weather of it, off Tawas Point, [[Michigan]], just hours before the brunt of the storm struck. When communication was restored and newspapers began carrying accounts of the storm the ''Isaac M. Scott'' was only listed as missing. The body of Capt. A. McArthur washed up at Southampton, [[Ontario]], [[Canada]] on 11 December 1913 while still wearing his life preserver. One of her lifeboats was found 23 miles north of the Chantrey Island lighthouse, off Southampton, [[Ontario]]. All 28 crew members perished in the disaster.&lt;ref name=GSM&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tbscuba.com/Wreck44.html |title=Isaac M. Scott |publisher= |date= |accessdate=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sinking of the ''Isaac M. Scott'' resulted in increased efforts by the U.S. Weather Bureau toward better weather forecasting and more rapid communication of storm warnings.

The ''Isaac M. Scott'' goes down in maritime history as one of twelve vessels lost during the [[Great Lakes Storm of 1913]]. A storm described in the book: Lore of the Lakes, as  "''The most disastrous that has ever swept our [[Great Lakes]], both from loss of life and property this unprecedented.''". The storm of heavy snow, bitter cold winds and frightening high waves took the lives of an estimated 235 mariners, 178 of which were lost on [[Lake Huron]] alone.

'''''Seeker After Truth: A Handbook''''' was written by [[Idries Shah]], one of the foremost writers on [[Sufism]].  It was first published by [[Octagon Press]] in 1982.

==Content==
The book is constructed from a mix of classical teaching tales, letters, question and answer sessions, anecdotes and discussions from dinner meetings.  As such it is part of the large corpus of material that Idries Shah disseminated over a 40 year period specifically for people who wished to absorb Sufi patterns of thought and behaviour in the way that he suggested was appropriate and effective for modern times. He described the process in this book in answer to the question, “What is the reason for the way in which your materials are projected in print? I mean, why do you translate some material, represent other portions, use Eastern similes in some and Western psychological terminology and insights in others?”
[[File:Idries Shah.gif|thumb|right|160px|[[Idries Shah]]]]
He replied, “There are two criteria:

(1) What materials have to be projected at the present time to have the maximum useful effect, and

(2) Who can absorb them and in what format?

“Sufic materials are always presented in accordance with the possibilities. This is because Sufism is not archaeology or hagiography (however much it may resemble them to those who look no further) but effect. Eastern similes that are still viable both in the East and West are used because of this viability. Superseded materials are not regurgitated just because they have been used in former times. Materials are re-presented if this can be usefully done. 'Western' psychological terminology and insights are useful, so they are used.

“Look at the results. The published materials are read and accepted in both the East and West; by scientists as well as theologians, by ordinary readers in addition to specialists of all kinds. In a word, the presentation is effective.
 
“If there were no originating impulse from which the material comes and which indicates how it may be used, we would be forced to present Sufi materials like you would any other dead corpus of lore: you would rearrange, prune and present in accordance with subjective assessments. We do not have to do this, since the material itself provides the guidance to those who can descry it. The question, however, illustrates the mind of the questioner more than anything else; for it presupposes that Sufi materials are like those of any other pursuit, capable of being manipulated by rule or whim. Had the questioner taken into consideration the Sufi fact that the Teaching determines its method of presentation, he would not have needed to ask the question.&lt;ref&gt;Shah, I. (1982) Seeker After Truth: A Handbook. London. Octagon Press. {{ISBN|0-900860-91-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[The Literary Review]] wrote that ''Seeker After Truth'' was, “food for many different kinds of study - a book unlike anything our own society has produced until recently, in its richness, its unexpectedness, its capacity to shock us into seeing ourselves as others see us, both personally and as a society.”

Robert Ornstein and Paul Ehrlich, in their book ''New World New Mind'', recommend ''Seeker After Truth'' and other books by Idries Shah "...for the beginnings of a short course on changing your mind." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

* [[Suicide of Tyrone Unsworth|A gay teenager Tyrone Unsworth killed himself]] after prolonged homophobic bullying at his school, which culminated with his being hospitalized after his jaw was struck with a fence used as a weapon by another boy.
*Roffee and Waling (2016) conducted a study that aimed to investigate incidents of bullying, harassment and violence committed towards LGBTIQ people. They discovered an issue, however, when they found that many people did not view what they had been subjected to as a hate crime, or even a crime at all. Furthermore, many of the participants commented on feeling that they did not meet the criteria of being a victim of harassment, bullying or violence. This established that prospective participants may not have felt that they met the criteria and thus would not have elected to take part in the study. The conclusion of the study established that all of the participants had been subjected to some form of victimisation, with some of the attacks being extremely violent and criminal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/306325028_Resolving_ethical_challenges_when_researching_with_minority_and_vulnerable_populations_LGBTIQ_victims_of_violence_harassment_and_bullying|title=James Roffee &amp; Andrea Waling Resolving ethical challenges when researching with minority and vulnerable populations: LGBTIQ victims of violence, harassment and bullying}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=James Roffee &amp; Andrea Waling Rethinking microaggressions and anti-social behaviour against LGBTIQ+ Youth | doi=10.1108/SC-02-2016-0004 | volume=15 | journal=Safer Communities | pages=190–201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Kenneth Zeller]], a gay man in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]] who was employed as a schoolteacher, was murdered by five young offenders in [[High Park]] in 1985. The incident spurred the [[Toronto District School Board]] to implement a program to combat anti-gay discrimination and violence — culminating in the creation of the [[Triangle Program]], Canada's first [[alternative school]] program for at-risk LGBT youth, in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Alanna Mitchell, "Welcome to Canada's gay high school: Toronto's Triangle program offers an educational refuge".

*On March 19, 1989, Joe Rose, a young gay activist in [[Montreal]], was [[stabbing|stabbed]] to death by a gang of teenagers who targeted him for having pink hair.

* Conner Copeman, 20 of [[Cumberland, British Columbia]] was assaulted in [[Saskatoon, Saskatchewan]] on July 11, 2007 by a group of men in a park in the city's [[Buena Vista, Saskatoon|Buena Vista]] neighbourhood. Copeman had recently moved to the city, and confessed to police that he was flirting with some men, who later attacked him. Copeman was found laying in the street six blocks east of the park, with a broken neck. Copeman ended up a [[quadriplegic]] as a result of his injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/paralyzed-man-helps-police-reopen-assault-case-1.1184996|title=Paralyzed man helps police reopen assault case|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Jordan Smith, 27, of [[White Rock, British Columbia]], was assaulted on September 27, 2008 by 20-year-old Michael Kandola of Vancouver.  Smith was holding hands with another male while walking in Vancouver's [[Davie Village]], an area frequented by [[GLBTQ]] individuals, when Kandola started following the pair with four to five of his friends and began shouting anti-gay obscenities towards the gay pair.  Kandola confronted the two and punched Smith on the side of his head, knocking him unconscious.  Smith required surgery for his injuries.

* ''Gisberta Salce Júnior'', more commonly known in [[Portugal]] as the Gisberta case, was a homeless [[Brazilian people|Brazilian]] transsexual immigrant, who was [[HIV positive]], had drug problems, and was a sex-worker. She was found dead on 22 February 2006 inside a pit 10 metres deep, in an unfinished building in [[Porto]], the second biggest Portuguese city. The crime was confessed to by a group of 14 boys, between the ages of 10 and 16 years old, most of whom came from a child protection institution belonging to the Catholic Church, although financed by the state. From this confession, details of the dreadful act became known. The victim had a deeply fragile health condition, and these boys frequently harassed, insulted, and chased her. On the 19th, a group of these boys entered the unfinished and abandoned building where Gisberta was staying, tied her up, gagged and assaulted her with extreme violence, kicking her and beating her up with sticks and stones. The group also confessed to having introduced sticks into Gisberta's anus, whose body presented great injuries, and to having abandoned her at the scene. Her body also had cigarette-burn marks. On the 20th and 21st, they returned to the scene and repeated the aggressions. By dawn, from the 21st to 22nd, they finally threw her into the pit, attempting to hide the crime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tgeu.org/gisberta-campaign-2006/ Gisberta Campaign (2006), Transgender Europe, 26.05.2017]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ilga.org/news_results.asp?LanguageID=1&amp;FileCategory=6&amp;FileID=823|title=Transexual Murdered in Portugal|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030055245/http://www.ilga.org/news_results.asp?LanguageID=1&amp;FileCategory=6&amp;FileID=823|archivedate=2009-10-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Infobox telescope | locmapin = South Africa}}

The '''Square Kilometre Array''' ('''SKA''') is a large multi [[radio telescope]] project proposed to be built in [[Australia]] and [[South Africa]]. If built, it would have a total collecting area of approximately one square kilometre.&lt;ref name=facts&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skatelescope.org/about/facts-figures/ |title=Facts and figures |publisher=SKA Organisation |accessdate=26 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1117/2.3201407.12| title = Philip Diamond plenary: The Square Kilometre Array: A Physics Machine for the 21st Century| journal = SPIE Newsroom| year = 2014| last1 = Spie}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would operate over a wide range of frequencies and its size would make it 50 times more sensitive than any other radio instrument. It would require very high performance central computing engines and long-haul links with a capacity greater than the global [[Internet traffic]] as of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skatelescope.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/SKA-Brochure.pdf], ''The Square Kilometre Array'', p.19&lt;/ref&gt; It should be able to [[Astronomical survey|survey the sky]] more than ten thousand times faster than before.

With receiving stations extending out to a distance of at least 3,000&amp;nbsp;kilometres (1,900&amp;nbsp;mi) from a concentrated central core, it would exploit [[radio astronomy]]'s ability to provide the highest resolution [[image]]s in all [[astronomy]]. The SKA would be built in the [[southern hemisphere]], in sub-Saharan states with cores in South Africa and Australia, where the view of the [[Milky Way]] [[Galaxy]] is the best and [[radio interference]] at its least.&lt;ref name="bbc1"/&gt;

The SKA is projected to cost €1.8 billion, including €650 million for Phase 1. The funding will come from many international funding agencies. The SKA and the [[European Extremely Large Telescope]] (E-ELT) are two flagship facilities for ground-based astronomy in the future.

Construction of the SKA is scheduled to begin in 2019 for initial observations by 2022, but the construction budget is not secured at this stage{{when|date=October 2018}}. The SKA would be built in two phases, with Phase 1 representing about 10% of the capability of the whole telescope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skatelescope.org/about/project/ |title=The project timeline |publisher=SKA Organisation |accessdate=28 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Ajn9v23t?url=http://www.skatelescope.org/about/project/ |archivedate=17 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ska.ac.za/about/bid.php |title=SKA site bid outcome |publisher=SKA Africa |accessdate=28 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140626022118/http://ska.ac.za/about/bid.php |archivedate=26 June 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Phase 1 of the SKA was cost-capped at 650 million euros in 2013, while Phase 2's cost has not yet been established.&lt;ref name="SKA Project"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.skatelescope.org/project/ |title=SKA Project |publisher=SKA Organisation |accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The headquarters of the project are located at the [[Jodrell Bank Observatory]], in the [[UK]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.skatelescope.org/ska-organisation/ |title=The SKA Organisation |publisher=SKA Organisation |accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-32523768 UK to be giant telescope's HQ].

==Description==
[[File:SKA participants map.svg|thumb|320px|Countries that participated in the preparatory phase of SKA&lt;ref name=SKAorghist&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.skatelescope.org/the-organisation/history-of-the-organisation/participating-countries/ |title=Participating countries |publisher=SKA Organisation}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The SKA will combine the signals received from thousands of small [[antenna (radio)|antennas]] spread over a distance of several thousand kilometres to simulate a single giant radio telescope capable of extremely high sensitivity and angular resolution, using a technique called [[aperture synthesis]].&lt;ref name=skalayout&gt;{{cite web|title=The SKA Layout|url=https://www.skatelescope.org/layout/|website=SKA Telescope|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the sub-arrays of the SKA will also have a very large field-of-view (FOV), making it possible to survey very large areas of sky at once.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The World’s Largest Radio Telescope Takes A Major Step Towards Construction|url=https://www.skatelescope.org/news/worlds-largest-radio-telescope-near-construction/|website=SKA Science|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One innovative development is the use of [[Focal-plane array (radio astronomy)|focal-plane arrays]] using [[phased-array]] technology to provide multiple [[FOV]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SKA Aperture Arrays|url=https://www.skatelescope.org/aperture-arrays/|website=SKA Telescope|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This will greatly increase the survey speed of the SKA and enable several users to observe different pieces of the sky simultaneously, which is useful for (e.g.) monitoring multiple pulsars. The combination of a very large FOV with high sensitivity means that the SKA will be able to compile extremely large surveys of the sky considerably faster than any other telescope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How will SKA1 be better than today's best radio telescopes?

The SKA will provide continuous frequency coverage from 50&amp;nbsp;MHz to 14&amp;nbsp;GHz in the first two phases of its construction. A third phase will then extend the frequency range up to 30&amp;nbsp;GHz.
* Phase 1: Providing ~10% of the total collecting area at low and mid frequencies by 2023 (SKA1).&lt;ref name=ska1&gt;{{cite web|title=SKA1|url=http://astronomers.skatelescope.org/ska1/|website=SKA Science|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Phase 2: Completion of the full array (SKA2) at low and mid frequencies by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SKA2|url=http://astronomers.skatelescope.org/ska2/|website=SKA Science|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The frequency range from 50&amp;nbsp;MHz to 14&amp;nbsp;GHz, spanning more than two [[Decade (log scale)|decades]], cannot be realised using one design of antenna and so the SKA will comprise separate sub-arrays of different types of antenna elements that will make up the SKA-low, SKA-mid and survey arrays:

[[File:SKA sparse array big.jpg|thumb|right|Artist's impression of a Low-Band SKA Sparse Aperture Array Station]]
[[File:SKA dense array big.jpg|thumb|right|Artist's impression of a SKA Dense Aperture Array Station]]

# SKA-low array – a phased array of simple [[dipole antenna]]s to cover the frequency range from 50 to 350&amp;nbsp;MHz. These will be grouped in 100&amp;nbsp;m diameter stations each containing about 90 elements.
# SKA-mid array – an array of several thousand [[Parabolic antenna|dish antennas]] (around 200 to be built in Phase 1) to cover the frequency range 350&amp;nbsp;MHz to 14&amp;nbsp;GHz. It is expected that the antenna design will follow that of the [[Allen Telescope Array]] using an offset Gregorian design having a height of 15 metres and a width of 12 metres.&lt;ref name=ska1 /&gt;
# SKA-survey array – a compact array of parabolic dishes of 12–15 meters diameter each for the medium-frequency range, each equipped with a multi-beam, phased array feed with a large field of view and several receiving systems covering about 350&amp;nbsp;MHz – 4&amp;nbsp;GHz. The survey sub-array was removed from the SKA1 specification following a "rebaselining" exercise in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McPherson|first1=A.|title=REPORT AND OPTIONS FOR RE-BASELINING OF SKA-1|url=https://www.skatelescope.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/SKA-TEL-SKO-0000229_Report-and-Options-for-Re-Baselining-of-SKA-1-Word_Amm-signed.pdf|website=SKA Telescope|publisher=SKAO|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area covered by the SKA – extending out to ~3000&amp;nbsp;km – will comprise three regions:&lt;ref name=skalayout /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dewdney|first1=P. E.|title=SKA Baseline Design|url=https://www.skatelescope.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/SKA-TEL-SKO-DD-001-1_BaselineDesign1.pdf|website=SKA Telescope|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# A central region containing about 5&amp;nbsp;km diameter cores of SKA-mid antennas (South Africa) and SKA-low dipoles (Western Australia). These central regions will contain approximately half of the total collecting area of the SKA arrays.
# A mid region extending out to 180&amp;nbsp;km. This will contain dishes and pairs of SKA-mid and SKA-low stations. In each case they will be randomly placed within the area with the density of dishes and stations falling off towards the outer part of the region.
# An outer region from 180&amp;nbsp;km to 3000&amp;nbsp;km. This will comprise five spiral arms, along which dishes of SKA-mid, grouped into stations of 20 dishes, will be located. The separation of the stations increases towards the outer ends of the spiral arms.

==Key projects==

The capabilities of the SKA will be designed to address a wide range of questions in [[astrophysics]], [[physics#Fundamental physics|fundamental physics]], [[Physical cosmology|cosmology]] and [[particle astrophysics]] as well as extending the range of the [[observable universe]]. A number of key science projects that have been selected for implementation via the SKA are listed below.

===Extreme tests of general relativity===
{{Main|Tests of general relativity}}
For almost one hundred years, [[Einstein]]'s [[general theory of relativity]] has precisely predicted the outcome of every experiment made to test it. Most of these tests, including the most stringent ones, have been carried out using radio astronomical measurements. By using [[pulsars]] as cosmic [[gravitational wave]] detectors, or timing pulsars found orbiting [[black holes]], astronomers will be able to examine the limits of general relativity such as the behaviour of [[spacetime]] in regions of extremely curved space. The goal is to reveal whether Einstein was correct in his description of space, time and gravity, or whether [[alternatives to general relativity]] are needed to account for these phenomena.

===Galaxies, cosmology, dark matter and dark energy===
{{Main|Galaxy formation and evolution|Dark matter}}
The sensitivity of the SKA in the [[hydrogen line|21 cm hydrogen line]] will map a billion galaxies out to the edge of the observable Universe. The [[large-scale structure of the cosmos]] revealed will give constraints to determine the processes resulting in [[galaxy formation and evolution]]. Imaging [[hydrogen]] through the Universe will provide a [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] picture of the first ripples of structure that formed individual galaxies and clusters. This may also allow the measurement of effects [[hypothesis|hypothetically]] caused by [[dark energy]] and causing the increasing [[Hubble's law|rate of expansion of the universe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Galaxy Evolution, Cosmology And Dark Energy – Further Information|url=http://www.skatelescope.org/the-science/ska-key-science-projects/ska-key-science-projects/galaxy-evolution/  |publisher=Skatelescope.org |date=2012-05-25 |accessdate=2012-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cosmological measurements enabled by SKA galaxy surveys include testing models of dark energy,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=1501.04088|title=Measuring baryon acoustic oscillations with future SKA surveys |journal=PoS AASKA () 024 |volume=14 |issue=2015 |author= Philip Bull |author2= Stefano Camera |author3= Alvise Raccanelli|author4= Chris Blake |author5= Pedro G.

===Epoch of re-ionization===
The SKA is intended to provide observational data from the so-called [[timeline of the Big Bang#Dark Ages|Dark Ages]] (between 300,000 years after the [[Big Bang]] when the universe became cool enough for hydrogen to become neutral and decouple from radiation) and the time of [[First light (astronomy)|First Light]] (a billion years later when young galaxies are seen to form for the first time and hydrogen becomes again ionized). By observing the primordial distribution of gas, the SKA should be able to see how the Universe gradually lit up as its stars and galaxies formed and then evolved. This period between the Dark Ages and First Light is considered the first chapter in the cosmic story of creation and the distance to see this event is the reason for the Square Kilometre Array's design. To see back to First Light requires a telescope 100 times more powerful than the biggest radio telescopes currently in the world, taking up 1 million square metres of collecting area, or one square kilometre.&lt;ref&gt;RiAus 2011, ''Radio Astronomy: Something Kinda Awesome, (SKA), viewed 1st October 2014'', http://vimeo.com/23460933/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cosmic magnetism===
It is still not possible to answer basic questions about the origin and evolution of [[magnetism|cosmic magnetic fields]], but it is clear that they are an important component of interstellar and intergalactic space. By mapping the effects of magnetism on the radiation from very distant galaxies, the SKA will investigate the form of cosmic magnetism and the role it has played in the evolving Universe.

===Search for extraterrestrial life===
This key science program, called "Cradle of Life", will focus on three  objectives: [[protoplanetary disc]]s in [[Circumstellar habitable zone|habitable zones]], search for prebiotic chemistry, and the search for extraterrestrial intelligence ([[SETI]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://science.nrao.edu/science/Decadal%20Survey/rfi/SKA.pdf The  Square Kilometre Array Project Description for Astro 2010] -Response to Program Prioritization Panels. James Cordes. 1 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The SKA will be able to probe the [[Circumstellar habitable zone|habitable zone]] of Sun-like [[protostar]]s, where [[Earth analog|Earth-like planets]] or moons are most likely to have environments favourable for the [[abiogenesis|development of life]].&lt;ref name="Life"&gt;[https://www.skatelescope.org/cradle-life/ SKA - Cradle Of Life].

April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Astrobiology|Astrobiologists]] will also use the SKA to search for complex [[organic compound]]s (carbon-containing chemicals) in outer space, including [[amino acid]]s, by identifying spectral lines at specific frequencies.&lt;ref name="Life"/&gt;
*The SKA will be capable of detecting extremely weak radio emissions "leakage" from nearby [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] civilizations, if they exist.&lt;ref name="Life"/&gt;

==Locations==
The headquarters of the SKA will be located at [[Manchester]]'s [[Jodrell Bank Observatory]], [[Cheshire]], England,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.skatelescope.org/news/construction-starts-ska-organisation-headquarters/ |title=Construction starts on SKA Organisation headquarters |date=18 April 2012 |publisher=SKA Organisation |accessdate=26 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the telescopes will be installed in Australia and South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ska.gov.au/About/Pages/CohostingTheSKA.aspx Co-hosting the SKA]. SKA&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:SKA-scanner.jpg|thumb|An automatic wideband radio scanner system was used to survey the radio frequency noise levels at the various candidate sites in South Africa.]]
Suitable sites for the SKA telescope must be in unpopulated areas with guaranteed very low levels of man-made radio interference. Four sites were initially proposed in South Africa, Australia, Argentina and China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koenig|first=Robert|date=18 August 2006|title=RADIO ASTRONOMY: Candidate Sites for World's Largest Telescope Face First Big Hurdle|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|publisher=[[American Association for the Advancement of Science|AAAS]]|volume=313|issue=5789|pages=910–912|doi=10.1126/science.313.5789.910|pmid=16917038}}&lt;/ref&gt; After considerable site evaluation surveys, Argentina and China were dropped and the other two sites were shortlisted (with New Zealand joining the Australian bid, and 8 other African countries joining the South African bid):

'''Australia:''' The core site is located at the [[Murchison Radio-astronomy Observatory]] (MRO) at [[Mileura Station]] near [[Boolardy]] in [[Western Australia]] 315&amp;nbsp;km north-east of [[Geraldton, Western Australia|Geraldton]]&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;Amos, J.

'''South Africa:''' The core site is located at {{Coord|30|43|16.068|S|21|24|40.06|E|display=inline}} at an elevation of about 1000 metres in the [[Karoo]] area of the arid [[Northern Cape]] Province, about 75&amp;nbsp;km north-west of [[Carnarvon, South Africa|Carnarvon]], with distant stations in [[Botswana]], [[Ghana]], [[Kenya]], [[Madagascar]], [[Mauritius]], [[Mozambique]], [[Namibia]] and [[Zambia]].

On 10 March 2012 it was reported that the SKA Site Advisory Committee had made a confidential report in February that the South African bid was stronger.&lt;ref name="age 20120309"&gt;{{cite news|last=Flitton|first=Daniel|title=Australia on the outer for largest space telescope|url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/australia-on-the-outer-for-largest-space-telescope-20120309-1upwr.html|accessdate=9 March 2012|newspaper=[[The Age]]|date=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final decision on the site by the project's board of directors was expected on 4 April 2012.&lt;ref name="age 20120309"/&gt; However a scientific working group was set up to explore possible implementation options of the two candidate host regions, and its report was expected in mid May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =Further delays signalled in super-telescope plan |agency=AFP |work=[[The Australian]]| date =5 April 2012 | url = http://www.theaustralian.com.au/australian-it/further-delays-signalled-in-super-telescope-plan/story-e6frgakx-1226319328674| accessdate =10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 May 2012 it was announced that the SKA will be split over the South African and African sites and the Australia and New Zealand sites.&lt;ref name="bbc1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-18194984|title=Africa and Australasia to share Square Kilometre Array|last=Amos|first=Jonathan|date=25 May 2012|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; While New Zealand remains a member of the SKA Organisation, {{as of|2014|lc=y}} it appears that no SKA infrastructure is likely to be in New Zealand.&lt;ref name="Australia"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.skatelescope.org/location/australia/|title=Australia - SKA Telescope|date=2014|publisher=SKA|accessdate=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Precursors, pathfinders and design studies==
Many groups are working globally to develop the technology and techniques required for the SKA. Their contributions to the international SKA project are classified as either: Precursors, Pathfinders or Design Studies.
* Precursor facility: A telescope on one of the two SKA candidate sites, carrying out SKA-related activity.
* Pathfinder: A telescope or programme carrying out SKA-related technology, science and operations activity.
* Design Study: A study of one or more major sub-systems of the SKA design, including the construction of prototypes

===Precursor facilities===
[[File:CSIRO ASKAP 2010.jpg|thumb|right|[[CSIRO]]'s [[ASKAP]] antennas at the [[Murchison Radio-astronomy Observatory|MRO]] in Western Australia]]

====Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP)====
{{Main|Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder}}
The Australian SKA Pathfinder, or ASKAP, is an A$100 million project to build a telescope array of thirty-six twelve-metre dishes. It will employ advanced, innovative technologies such as [[Focal-plane array (radio astronomy)|phased array feeds]] to give a wide field of view (30 square degrees).

ASKAP is being built by [[CSIRO]] at the Murchison Radio-astronomy Observatory site, located near [[Boolardy]] in the mid-west region of Western Australia. All 36 antennas and their technical systems were officially opened in October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Osborne |first=Darren |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-10-05/outback-observatory-open-for-business/4298094 |title=Outback observatory open for business - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) |publisher=Abc.net.au |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====MeerKAT====
{{Main|MeerKAT}}
MeerKAT is a South African project consisting of an array of sixty-four 13.5-metre diameter dishes as a world class science instrument, and also to help develop technology for the SKA. [[KAT-7]], a seven-dish engineering and science testbed instrument for MeerKAT, near Carnarvon in the Northern Cape Province of South Africa was commissioned in 2012 and is up and running. As of May 2018, all sixty-four 13.5-metre diameter (44.3 feet) dish antennae have been completed with verification tests underway to ensure the instruments are functioning correctly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tshangela|first1=Lebo|title=MeerKAT telescope is complete|url=http://www.sabcnews.com/sabcnews/meerkat-telescope-is-complete/|accessdate=25 May 2018|work=SABC News|date=16 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dishes will be equipped with a number of high performance single pixel feeds to cover frequencies from 580&amp;nbsp;MHz up to 14&amp;nbsp;GHz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ska.ac.za|title=SKA SA – Square Kilometre Array radio telescope (SKA) South Africa|publisher=|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Data challenges====
The amount of sensory information collected pose a huge storage problem and require real-time [[signal processing]] to reduce the information to relevant data. In mid 2011 it was estimated the array could generate an [[exabyte]] a day of raw data, which could be compressed to around 10 [[petabyte]]s.&lt;ref name="ttgmd"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.computerworld.com.au/article/392735/ska_telescope_generate_more_data_than_entire_internet_2020/ |title=SKA telescope to generate more data than entire Internet in 2020 |date=7 July 2011 |work=Computerworld |publisher=IDG Communications |accessdate=2 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Technology Development Project (TDP)====
The Technology Development Project, or TDP, is a US$12 million project to specifically develop dish and feed technology for the SKA. It is operated by a consortium of universities led by [[Cornell University]] and was completed in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://skatdp.astro.cornell.edu/|title=Welcome to the SKA TDP Website|first=Shami|last=Chatterjee|publisher=|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline and funding==
The SKA was originally conceived in 1991 with an international working group set up in 1993. This led to the signing of the first Memorandum of Agreement in 2000. Considerable early development work then followed. This culminated in the commencement of PrepSKA in 2008 leading to a full SKA design in 2012. Construction of Phase 1 will take place from 2018 to 2020 providing an operational array capable of carrying out the first science. Phase 2 will then follow for completion in 2025 providing full sensitivity for frequencies up to at least 14&amp;nbsp;GHz.

==Project risks==
Potential risks for priority astronomical sites in South Africa are protected by the [[Astronomy Geographic Advantage Act]] of 2007. Put in place to specifically support the South African SKA bid, it outlaws all activities that could endanger scientific operation of core astronomical instruments. In 2010, concerns were raised over the will to enforce this law when [[Royal Dutch Shell]] applied to explore the [[Karoo]] for [[shale gas]] using [[hydraulic fracturing]], an activity that would have the potential to increase [[radio interference]] at the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nordling|first=Linda|title=Mining plans pose threat to South African astronomy site|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110322/full/news.2011.174.html?s=news_rss|accessdate=27 June 2011|newspaper=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|date=22 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An identified remote station location for the southern African array in [[Mozambique]] was subject to flooding and excluded from the project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201206270018.html
|title=Mozambique: Exact Location of SKA Telescope Sought

despite the SKA Site Selection Committee technical analysis reporting that all African remote stations could implement flood mitigation solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skatelescope.org/uploaded/34228_120216_SSAC.Report_web.pdf|title=Report and Recommendation of the SKA Site Advisory Committee (SSAC)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia's first [[radio quiet zone]] was established by the [[Australian Communications and Media Authority]] (ACMA) on 11 April 2005 specifically to protect and maintain the current "radio-quietness" of the main Australian SKA site at the Murchison Radio-astronomy Observatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Planning for the radio astronomy service |url=http://www.acma.gov.au/WEB/STANDARD/pc=PC_100628 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070909092701/http://www.acma.gov.au/WEB/STANDARD//pc=PC_100628 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=9 September 2007 |accessdate=3 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012, a former Australian SKA Committee chairman raised concerns with South African media about risks at the Australian candidate site, particularly in terms of cost, mining interference and land agreements. SKA Australia stated that all points had been addressed in the site bid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

During 2014, South Africa experienced a month-long strike action by the [[National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa|National Union of Metalworkers]] (NUMSA), which added to the delays of the installation of dishes. The plan was to have six dishes operational by November, but only one [[MeerKAT]] dish stands on the [[Karoo]] site in the Northern Cape.&lt;ref name="Strike action"&gt;{{cite news

The largest risk to the overall project is probably its budget, which up until now has not been committed.&lt;ref name="SKA Project"/&gt;

==Opposition to the SKA project==
There has been opposition to the project from farmers and businesses, as well as individuals, since the project's inception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Astronomers and sheep farmers butt heads over the Square Kilometer Array|url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21713855-radio-telescope-project-encounters-nimbyism-remote-part-south|website=www.economist.com|publisher=The Economist|accessdate=30 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advocacy group called Save the Karoo has stated that the radio quiet zone will create further unemployment in the region where unemployment is already above 32%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Save the Karoo|url=http://savethekaroo.com/|website=savethekaroo.com/|accessdate=30 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farmers had stated that the agriculture-based economy in the Karoo would collapse if they were forced to sell their land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sarah|first1=Wild|title=In South Africa, Opposition Flares against Giant SKA Radio Telescope|date=22 June 2016|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/in-south-africa-opposition-flares-against-giant-ska-radio-telescope/|website=Scientific American|accessdate=19 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wild|first1=Sarah|title=Giant SKA telescope rattles South African community|url=http://www.nature.com/news/giant-ska-telescope-rattles-south-african-community-1.20129|website=Nature|accessdate=30 March 2017|pages=444–446|language=en|doi=10.1038/534444a|date=23 June 2016|bibcode = 2016Natur.534..444W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chirality (chemistry)|Chirality]] in [[supramolecular chemistry]] implies the non-symmetric arrangement of molecular components in a non-covalent assembly.

{{terrorism|Jihad=muslim affiliated groups}}{{More citations needed|date=May 2018}}
A '''terrorist training camp''' is a facility established to train individuals in the ways of [[terrorism]], often without the consent of the trainees.{{fact|date=July 2018}} By teaching them the methods and tactics of [[terrorism]], those conducting such facilities aim to create an "army" of individuals who will do their bidding. They are often located in, but not confined to, regions where it is intended that acts of terrorism will be carried out, or in traditional areas of extremism, such as [[Pakistan]], [[Afghan training camp|Afghanistan]], [[Iraq]] and [[Somalia]].&lt;ref name="AFGHANISTAN"&gt;[http://english.people.com.cn/200207/12/eng20020712_99617.shtml 4000 Britons trained at terror camps in Afghanistan]: Paper The People's Daily, July 12, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4841170.stm Is Somalia next for 'war on terror'?] BBC News. 7 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Wide-open spaces such as parks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/news/181_1768396,001302420000.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927195944/http://www.hindustantimes.com/news/181_1768396,001302420000.htm |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt; and wilderness areas&lt;ref&gt;CBS News May 26, 2004: [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/05/27/terror/main620045.shtml U.S.: Cleric Eyed Ore. Terror Camp]&lt;/ref&gt; are common sites for these camps.

== Locations ==
Most camps are located in the Middle East, with the most infamous in [[Syria]] and the Arabian peninsula.{{fact|date=July 2018}} Many camps are located in regions of conflict. The call to [[jihad]] has seen many Muslims enter such camps, followed by US drone strikes.{{fact|date=July 2018}}

==Purpose==
These encampments provide recruits with weapons training, protocol training, interaction with skilled veterans, and a secure geographic location for operations. Recruits are regularly indoctrinated in the goals and beliefs of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/terrorist-indoctrination-turning-people-killers-norman |author1=Lihou Dr. Norman T. Lihou |date=25 January 2015 |title=Terrorist Indoctrination Turning People into Killers |website=LinkedIn|accessdate=20 June 2017}}{{dead link|date=July 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizational leaders attempt to isolate recruits from their outside social connections and force them to establish a new identity.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} This allows the organization to become the “family” of the recruit and generate loyalty to the organization’s goals.

== Psychological traits ==
Depending on the type of organization, the religion and “strength of faith” of the recruit is often an indicator of their status within the organization. Those who are not willing to comply, even after completion of training, are often punished and undergo training to strengthen their observance.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} Terrorist recruits are tested on knowledge of their religion and of rival groups. Recruiters do this to verify that each recruit has the necessary beliefs, which ensures organizational unification. Religious verification ensures that each member is working towards mutual goals.&lt;ref name="Understanding terrorism"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/2009/11/terrorism.aspx |title=Understanding Terrorism |last=DeAngelis |first=Tori |date=November 2009|website=American Psychological Association |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109122812/http://www.apa.org/monitor/2009/11/terrorism.aspx|archive-date=2010-01-09|deadurl=yes |accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recruiters use techniques that exploit or create mental trauma in order to produce a dissociated mindset in recruits — a condition in which the identity and awareness of the recruit is reset.&lt;ref name="Understanding terrorism"/&gt; Typical recruits look to join terrorist organizations because they are angry, alienated and/or disenfranchised.{{fact|date=July 2018}} Common thought processes include: believing that their current political involvement does not give them the power to effect change; identifying with perceived victims of the perceived social injustice they are fighting; feeling the need to take action; believing that violence is not immoral; having friends or family sympathetic to the cause; and craving social and psychological rewards such as adventure, camaraderie, and a heightened sense of identity.{{fact|date=July 2018}} Internet and cyber-skills are sought after as technically knowledgeable recruits can help the organization.{{fact|date=July 2018}}

In [[knot theory]], the '''three-twist knot''' is the [[twist knot]] with three-half twists. It is listed as the '''5&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; knot''' in the [[Alexander-Briggs notation]], and is one of two knots with [[crossing number (knot theory)|crossing number]] five, the other being the [[cinquefoil knot]].

The three-twist knot is a [[prime knot]], and it is [[invertible knot|invertible]] but not [[amphichiral knot|amphichiral]].  Its [[Alexander polynomial]] is

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta(t) = 2t-3+2t^{-1}, \,&lt;/math&gt;

its [[Alexander polynomial#Alexander.E2.80.93Conway polynomial|Conway polynomial]] is

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla(z) = 2z^2+1, \, &lt;/math&gt;

and its [[Jones polynomial]] is

:&lt;math&gt;V(q) = q^{-1} - q^{-2} + 2q^{-3} - q^{-4} + q^{-5} - q^{-6}. \, &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Knot Atlas|5_2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the Alexander polynomial is not [[monic polynomial|monic]], the three-twist knot is not [[fibered knot|fibered]].

The three-twist knot is a [[hyperbolic knot]], with its complement having a [[Hyperbolic volume (knot)|volume]] of approximately 2.82812.

If the fibre of the knot in the initial image of this page were cut at the bottom right of the image, and the ends were pulled apart, it would result in a single-stranded [[Figure-of-nine loop#Figure-of-nine_knot|figure-of-nine knot]] (not the figure-of-nine loop).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2890">In the legal system of England and Wales, the '''victim surcharge''' is a penalty applied to people convicted of offences, in addition to a  [[conditional discharge]], a fine, or a community or custodial sentence, in order to provide compensation for the victims of crime.&lt;ref name="SC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sentencingcouncil.org.uk/about-sentencing/types-of-sentence/other-orders-made-on-sentencing/what-is-the-victim-surcharge/|title=What is the victim surcharge?|publisher=[[Sentencing Council]]|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC-28696150"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-28696150|title=Criminals jailed by magistrates to pay victim surcharge|date=8 August 2014|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The surcharge is not paid directly to the criminal's victim, but is pooled and distributed through the [[Victim and Witness General Fund]]. The amount to be paid is specified by law, and courts have no discretion to reduce the amount, nor to waive the surcharge, even for defendants of limited means.&lt;ref name="Rozenberg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawgazette.co.uk/law/victim-surcharge-unintended-consequences/71546.fullarticle|title=Victim surcharge: unintended consequences|last=Rozenberg|first=Joshua|work=Law Society Gazette|publisher=[[Law Society]]|accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law journalist [[Joshua Rozenberg]] has reported cases where a surcharge levied against a young person became the responsibility of their parents - even when a parent was the victim of the crime in question.&lt;ref name="Rozenberg" /&gt;

The surcharge was first introduced in 2007.&lt;ref name="BBC-28696150" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC-6431401"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6431401.stm|title='Victim surcharge' on court fines|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1 September 2014, the discretion of [[Magistrates' court (England and Wales)|magistrates' courts]] to apply additional custody days in lieu of the surcharge was withdrawn.&lt;ref name="BBC-28696150" /&gt;

== Amounts ==
For offences committed after 8 April 2016, the amount of the surcharge, depending on the penalty awarded, is:&lt;ref name="SC"/&gt;

; Conditional discharge : £20
; Fine : 10% of the fine value (£30 minimum, £170 maximum)
; Community sentence : £85
; Custodial sentence of 6 months and below : £115
; Custodial sentence, 6 months to 2 years : £140
; Custodial sentence over 2 years : £170 (only in Crown Court)
; Suspended sentence, 6 months and below : £115
; Suspended sentence, over 6 months : £140 

Other figures apply for [[legal person]]s who are not individuals; and offenders aged under 18.

Official figures show that £51m was raised, between 2010 and 2014.&lt;ref name="BBC-28696150" /&gt;

'''Vladimir Aleksandrovich Usov '''(1957 - 2006), known as the "'''The Hunter of Boys'''", was a [[Soviet]]-[[Russia]]n [[serial killer]] who raped and killed little boys. One of the youngest serial killers (began to kill at 17 years of age), he was declared insane and spent 30 years in psychiatric hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://историческая-самара.рф/каталог/самара-криминальная/судебные-дела/дела-по-ук-рсфср-1960-1996-годов/голоса,-приказывавшие-убивать.html Голоса, приказывавшие убивать]&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Biography ==
Usov grew up in a drinking family. From the 5th grade, he dropped out of school unexpectedly, claiming that he had [[Auditory hallucination|heard some voices]] that told him not to go to school. His parents took him to a psychiatrist, who diagnosed Vladimir with paranoid schizophrenia. Thus, at the age of 14, Usov received 2 disability groups and a small pension.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vkonline.ru/content/view/66322/manyaki-sovetskogo-perioda Маньяки советского периода]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 17, voices began to call for Usov to perform acts of a [[pederastic]] nature. The first murder he committed occurred in [[Samara|Kuybyshev]] on August 1, 1974, when an 8-year-old boy named Boris, who had been missing since July 30, was killed. On that day, the boy was playing in the courtyard of his house when a man in a sports suit came up to him and suggested going to a nearby forest to collect nuts. No one else saw the boy after that. This was the coroner's report:{{Cquote
| quote = A corpse of a boy aged 7-10 years with signs of a violent death and sodomy was found in a forest massif two kilometres from the administrative village. In the course of the initial examination, traces of strangulation were found on the corpse…
}}After that, Usov killed four more boys. After the murder of 7-year-old Valery in [[Tolyatti]], a witness reported seeing suspicious people who made strange signs to each other. Rehearsing this version, the senior inspector of the Criminal Investigation, Gronid Simakov, entered the company of several [[homosexual]] people. The murder of two of the victims was initially attributed to the physics teacher Petr Popov. He willingly took the blame, wishing to die, because during the investigation his sexuality was revealed, writing a death letter and twice trying to hang himself in his cell. While studying Popov's testimony, Simakov realized that the suspect was innocent, and informed the authorities about this. Employees of the criminal investigation department had already reported to [[Moscow]] about "exposing" Popov and began to pressure Simakov, threatening him with court, and he was removed from office. However, Simakov stood his ground, and it was impossible to condemn the innocent Popov.

The last murder Usov committed was on June 17, 1975 in the Goreliy Khutor village. After raping and strangling a child, he collected a heap of dry brushwood, flunked the boy's body with it and set it on fire. He was arrested soon after.

On June 1, 1977, the Kuybyshev Regional Court ruled that Vladimir Usov be sent to [[compulsory treatment]] in a psychiatric clinic. For 18 years he was kept in a specialized clinic in [[Kazan]], and then transferred to a clinic in Samara, where he managed to escape from in 1996. He kidnapped two boys whom he was going to kill, but was too afraid. The next day he was captured and sent to the Kazan clinic for especially dangerous insane people, where he died in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tltgorod.ru/crime/article-30309/1/ Охотник на мальчиков]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16414">[[File:WashingMouthWithSoap.png|thumb|1937 cartoon in ''[[Boys' Life]]'']]
'''Washing out mouth with soap''' is a traditional form of [[physical punishment]] that consists in placing [[soap]], or a similar cleansing agent, inside a person's mouth so that the person will taste it, inducing what most people consider an unpleasant experience.  This form of punishment was especially common in the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] from the late 19th century through the 1960s.

Washing out mouth with soap is most often used as a response to [[profanity]], [[Lie|lying]], [[biting]],&lt;ref&gt;Old Remedy Not Advised. Portsmouth Daily Times - May 3, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; [[tobacco use]], or verbal disrespect. It functions both as a symbolic "cleansing" following the infraction, as well as acting as a deterrent due to the foul [[aftertaste]]. It is commonly used as [[child discipline]] or [[school discipline]], and is more frequently employed by mothers than fathers.&lt;ref&gt;Dimensions of discipline by fathers and mothers as recalled by university students http://gauss.unh.edu/~mas2/DD03%20Draft%20D9.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407082144/http://gauss.unh.edu/~mas2/DD03%20Draft%20D9.pdf |date=2014-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This punishment still has advocates today, even though its use has diminished considerably in recent years in favour of [[discipline]] methods that are not considered [[violence|violent]] or [[humiliation|humiliating]]. Additionally, ingestion of [[soap]]s and [[detergent]]s can have potentially serious health consequences, and persons utilizing this form of punishment may face legal sanctions.

==Technique==
Washing out mouth with soap is essentially defined by the introduction of soap, or a soap-like cleansing agent, into the [[oral cavity]].  Methods commonly used for this purpose include placing a bar of soap in a person's mouth and forcing them to hold it there, chew it, and/or swallow it; forcing a person to drink liquid soap or another liquid cleanser or to swish such liquids in their mouth; and using a toothbrush to brush the used cleaning product onto a person's teeth and oral tissues.

===Safety===
Washing out mouth with soap is meant to be unpleasant, but is usually not intended to cause death or serious harm.  Nonetheless, many people employ the aforementioned techniques with extremely limited knowledge regarding the safety of ingesting their chosen cleansing agents.  Agents likely to cause serious harm if swallowed include many [[automatic dishwasher detergent]]s and [[laundry detergent]]s.  Even ordinary bar soaps and liquid hand soaps may cause harmful effects including [[vomiting]], [[diarrhea]], irritation of the lining of the mouth and [[digestive tract]], and in rare instances, [[pulmonary aspiration]].  This is especially true if these products are ingested in large quantities.

==History==
{{rquote|left|A friend of mine was horrified one day by hearing her little boy make use of a very bad word [...] Turning to the maid she said, "Jane, you may take Master Dick up stairs and wash his mouth out with soap and water. It is too soiled for him to sit at the table with us..."|[[Good Housekeeping]], 1889&lt;ref&gt;Good Housekeeping: Volume 9 - Page 276. 1889&lt;/ref&gt;}}

One of the earliest recorded uses of forcing another to ingest soap as punishment appeared in the 1832 [[Legal Examiner]], in which it was noted that a married couple "were constantly quarrelling ; and that one evening, on the man's return home, he found his wife intoxicated, [...] perceiving a piece of kitchen soap lying on the ground near the spot, he crammed it into his wife's mouth, saying, "She has had plenty of water to wash with, she ought now to have a little soap".&lt;ref&gt;The Legal examiner: Volume 1 - Page 508. Great Britain. Courts - 1832&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1860s, the periodical [[Aunt Judy's Annual Volume]] featured the main characters forced to eat a bar of soap as punishment for constantly failing to wash up, as the [[Climax (narrative)|climax]] to a story entitled "Scaramouches at School".&lt;ref&gt;Volume 6, Issue 32 (Aunt Judy's Annual Volume)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1872, [[The Chinese Recorder and Missionary Journal]] stated that the practice of washing out the mouth of a child heard to swear was noted by an American colleague, and should be recommended to colleagues in the Orient as well.&lt;ref&gt;The Chinese recorder and missionary journal - Page 452. ''A friend of the writer in America called into the bath room a little son who was heard for the first time to swear, and scrubbed his mouth out with soap and a nail brush''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1873, a schoolmistress in [[Mahaska County, Iowa|Mahaska, Iowa]] was noted to have punished a boy in her class for indulging in [[chewing tobacco]] by washing his mouth out with soap.&lt;ref&gt;The New York State educational journal: devoted to popular ...: Volumes 2-3 - Page 607books.google.comO. R. Burchard, New York State Teachers Association - 1873&lt;/ref&gt;  Much later examples tell how [[Filipino people|Filipino]] or [[Lakota people|Lakota]] aboriginals were punished for speaking their native language with a similar punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Styles of speaking: an analysis of Lakota communication alternatives ES Grobsmith - Anthropological Linguistics, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Man in the Outhouse: How Western Colonization Silenced the Filipino Imagination. P Abarquez-Delacruz - Amerasia Journal, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

An 1898 "study in moral education", published by the [[Journal of Genetic Psychology]], noted that whipping, withdrawal of privileges, lectures, being sent alone to a room and washing out a subject's mouth with either soap, salt or pepper, were the most likely punishments to deter future abuses.&lt;ref&gt;Journal of genetic psychology: Volume 5. [[Granville Stanley Hall]], [[Carl Allanmore Murchison]] - 1898&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, a New York State Department of Social Welfare officer submitted a complaint against the [[Rochester Orphan Asylum]] noting that "I find, as charged, that children's mouths have been washed with soap-suds, but not, as also charged, with ashes and water; that such punishments were ordered for obscene or profane language".&lt;ref&gt;Report. New York (State). Dept. of Social Welfare - 1890&lt;/ref&gt; By the start of the 20th century, the practice was also noted at the [[Maryland State Reformatory for Women]] as punishment for any infraction of the rules.&lt;ref&gt;Initiated Water Cure. The Sun (1837-1985) - Baltimore, Md. Date: Dec 21, 1919&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1940s, washing out mouth with soap was a [[hazing ritual]] in the British [[Royal Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalnavyresearcharchive.org.uk/SLINGER/SLING-1.HTM|title=Birth of SLINGER|website=www.royalnavyresearcharchive.org.uk|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, several American schoolboards ruled in favour of washing out a pupil's mouth with soap as a legitimate punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Washing Mouth With Soap Ruled Okay .St. Petersburg Times - Dec 14, 1955&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mouth-Washing Of Pupil Seen As Not Violating School Policy -Hartford Courant - Apr 29, 1956&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953, Wisconsin judge Harvey L. Neelan fined a Miss Mertz $25 for her drunken obscenities and noted that she should be required to wash her mouth with soap.&lt;ref&gt;The Milwaukee Journal - Jan 16, 1953&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1963, Michigan judge Francis Castellucci ordered Louis Winiarski, who had been found using obscene language around women and children, to wash his mouth with soap before leaving the courtroom.&lt;ref&gt;Kentucky New Era - Jul 10, 1963&lt;/ref&gt; A similar case in October 1979 saw a New York resident choose to wash his mouth out with soap, rather than serve ten days in prison for his disorderly conduct and obscenities.&lt;ref&gt;The Press-Courier - Oct 19, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, the [[National Criminal Justice Reference System]] published a report defending the use of corporal punishment in schools, in which a school administrator noted that he documented 200 cases, over his 13-year career, of using corporal punishmenting, noting "That's not just using paddles in every instance, but if you shake a student, if you grab a student, if you wash a student's mouth out with soap, that's corporal punishment under the definition of the law".&lt;ref&gt;A practical defense of corporal punishment in the schools[PDF] from ncjrs.govLK Reinholz - Hyman, IA, &amp; Wise, JH (1979). Corporal punishment in schools, 1977. https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/51400NCJRS.pdf#page=37&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, the [[Journal of Youth and Adolescence]] listed the practise, alongside [[Paddle (spanking)|paddling]] and [[hairpulling]] as a "moderate" punishment for children, beneath the realm of "severe" punishment such as [[Flagellation|whipping]].&lt;ref&gt;Corporal punishment: Normative data and sociological and psychological correlates in a community college population. JW Bryan… - Journal of Youth and Adolescence, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly in 1996, the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] classified it as an alternative to [[spanking]].&lt;ref&gt;A review of the outcomes of parental use of nonabusive or customary physical punishment. RE Larzelere - Pediatrics, 1996 - Am Acad Pediatrics&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, students at the [[Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts]] carried out a [[peer-reviewed]] study on the ability of punishment to curb the use of profanity by interviewing colleagues on their remembered upbringings, and noted that the most commonly reported parental reaction was a verbal reprimand (41%). Soap in the mouth was mentioned in 20% of the episodes, and physical punishments were described in 14%.&lt;ref&gt;Memories of punishment for cursing. T Jay, K King… - Sex roles, 2006 www.mcla.edu/Undergraduate/uploads/textWidget/1457.00013/documents/tj_mem_punish.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal ramifications==
[[File:Matthew Getting Mouth Washed Out With Soap.jpg|thumb|An infant having his mouth washed out with soap]]
There have been a number of cases of arrests, charges and civil lawsuits arising from the domestic discipline of washing another's mouth out with soap; often arising from the perception of abuse of parental authority by an outside figure.

'''William St Julien Arabin''' (1773{{snd}}15 December 1841) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] lawyer and judge who served as the [[Judge Advocate General (United Kingdom)|Judge-Advocate-General of the Army]] for a three-and-a-half-month period (6 November 1838{{snd}}21 February 1839).

Arabin was born either in [[Norwich]] or abroad, the only surviving son of General William John Arabin of Ireland, who left him significant estates in Essex and Middlesex.&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{cite news |title=Death of Mr. Serjeant Arabin |work=[[The Times]] |publisher=The Times Digital Archive |page=4 |date=17 December 1841 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gent"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Mr. Serjeant Arabin|journal=The Gentleman's Magazine|date=1842|page=219}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was descended from one of the oldest families in [[Provence]]. His Huguenot ancestor Bartholomew d'Arabin fled to Holland after the [[revocation of the edict of Nantes]] in 1685, and came over to England with King [[William III of England|William III]] in 1688.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marshall|first1=John|title=Royal Naval Biography|date=1831|publisher=Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme, and Brown|page=69|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z11HAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA69|accessdate=16 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arabin attended [[St Paul's School, London]] and [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]]. He was admitted to [[Inner Temple]] in 1793, and was [[called to the bar]] in 1801. He was appointed [[serjeant-at-law]] in 1824.&lt;ref&gt;''Cambridge University Alumni: 1261-1900''&lt;/ref&gt;

He was Deputy [[Recorder of London|Recorder of the City of London]]. He served as Judge-Advocate-General of the Army 1838{{ndash}}39. He was a judge of the [[Central Criminal Court]] and of Sheriffs' Court, London. He was a [[Verderer]] of the forests of [[Epping Forest|Epping]] and [[Hainault Forest|Hainault]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WPPcP39XDDIC&amp;pg=PA65&amp;lpg=PA65&amp;dq=William+St+Julien+Arabin&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ULhBqosFAK&amp;sig=5UpSjqYDWHi7JdRK4PW6Kkino1A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwid6tzI06zMAhVKLZoKHWSDBfwQ6AEIVTAM#v=onepage&amp;q=William%20St%20Julien%20Arabin&amp;f=false |title=Alumni Cantabrigienses |editor-first1=John |editor-last1=Venn |editor-first2=John Archibald |editor-last2=Venn |page=65 |date=September 2011 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=9781108036115 |accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a judge, Arabin was known as an eccentric figure who was notorious for his confused pronouncements.  Some of his most famous quotes include:
* ''If there ever was a case of clearer evidence than this of persons acting together, this case is that case...'' and
* ''They will steal the very teeth out of your mouth as you walk through the streets &amp;mdash; I know it from experience...''

Arabin married Mary Meux in Camden in 1802.&lt;ref&gt;''London, England, Church of England Marriages and Banns, 1754-1921''&lt;/ref&gt; He died at Arabin House in High Beech, [[Waltham Abbey (town)|Waltham Abbey]], Essex, in 1841.&lt;ref name="gent"/&gt;
