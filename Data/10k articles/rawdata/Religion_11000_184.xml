{{Thelema}}
'''Abrahadabra''' is a word that first publicly appeared in ''[[The Book of the Law]]'' (1904), the central sacred text of [[Thelema]]. Its author, [[Aleister Crowley]], described it as "the Word of the [[Aeon (Thelema)|Aeon]], which signifieth The [[Great Work]] accomplished."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Crowley|1997|loc="Liber Samekh"}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is in reference to his belief that the writing of ''Liber Legis'' (another name for "The Book of the Law") heralded a new Aeon for mankind that was ruled by the god [[Ra-Hoor-Khuit]] (a form of [[Horus]]). Abrahadabra is, therefore, the "[[magical formula]]" of this new age. It is not to be confused with the Word of the Law of the Aeon, which is ''Thelema'', meaning "[[True Will|Will]]".

==Description==
Crowley replaced the 'C' in "[[Abracadabra]]" with an 'H', which the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]] in their Neophyte ritual linked with Breath and Life&lt;ref&gt;''Hiero'': Is there any peculiarity in these names?
''Hierus'': They all commence with the letter 'H'.
''Hiero'': Of what is this letter a symbol?
''Hierus'': Of life; because this letter 'H' is our mode of representing the ancient Greek aspirate or breathing, and Breath is the evidence of Life.

''The Golden Dawn'' by Israel Regardie, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as with the god Horus.&lt;ref name="Hoor"&gt;''Golden Dawn'' links Horus with the letter 'H' on p. 345, and with the Hierus, p. 338, 352.&lt;/ref&gt; Aleister Crowley had taken the place of Horus or the Hierus officer&lt;ref name="Hoor" /&gt; in the Golden Dawn's Neophyte ritual,&lt;ref&gt;"The Book of Results" as presented in ''[[The Equinox of the Gods (Crowley)|The Equinox of the Gods]]'', [http://www.hermetic.com/crowley/eoftg/eqotg6.html Chapter 6].&lt;/ref&gt; which means that he personally gave the response explaining the meaning of the letter 'H'.

Crowley explains in his essay "Gematria" that he changed the magick word to include 'H' because of [[qabalah|qabalistic]] methods. He appears to say that this happened before his January 1901 meeting with [[Oscar Eckenstein]], one of his teachers. At this meeting, Eckenstein ordered Crowley to put aside magick for the moment, and to practice meditation or concentration.&lt;ref&gt;Sutin, ''Do What Thou Wilt'', p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; In "Gematria", Crowley says he took great interest in Abrahadabra, and its qabalistic number 418, at the time someone ordered him to "abandon the study of magic and the Qabalah". In the Book of Thoth, Crowley refers to Abrahadabra as a 'cypher' of the Great Work.

The word "Abrahadabra" appears repeatedly in the 1904 invocation of Horus that preceded the writing of ''Liber Legis'' and led to the founding of [[Thelema]].&lt;ref&gt;(''[[The Equinox]]'' I(7), 1912)&lt;/ref&gt; It also appears in a May 1901 diary that Crowley published in ''[[The Equinox]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"THE TEMPLE OF SOLOMON THE KING. IV" in ''The Equinox'' I(4), 1910&lt;/ref&gt;

The essay "Gematria" gives [[Hinduism|Hindu]], [[Christianity|Christian]], and "Unsectarian" versions of the problem that Crowley intended this magick word to answer. He also gives a qabalistic equivalent for each phrasing, and a brief symbolic answer for each. The unsectarian version reads, "I am the finite square; I wish to be one with the infinite circle." Its equivalent refers to "the Cross of Extension" and "the infinite Rose." Crowley's numerological explanation of "ABRAHADABRA" focuses mainly on this last formulation and the answer to it.

"Abrahadabra" is also referred to as the "Word of Double Power". More specifically, it represents the uniting of the [[Macrocosm and microcosm|Microcosm]] with the [[Macrocosm and microcosm|Macrocosm]]—represented by the [[pentagram]] and the [[hexagram]], the [[Rosy Cross|rose and the cross]], the circle and the square, the 5 and the 6 (etc.), as also called the attainment of the Knowledge and Conversation of one's [[Holy Guardian Angel]]. In ''Commentaries'' (1996), Crowley says that the word is a symbol of the "establishment of the pillar or [[phallus]] of the Macrocosm...in the void of the Microcosm."

==Mystical interpretations==

===Gematria===

As with most things found in the mystical works of [[Aleister Crowley]], the word "Abrahadabra" can be examined using the [[qabalah|qabalistic]] method of [[gematria]], which is a form of numerology, whereby correspondences are made based on numerical values.

*ABRAHADABRA = 418
*ABRAHADABRA has 11 letters
*ABRAHADABRA = 1+2+2+1+5+1+4+1+2+2+1 = 22
*The five letters in the word are: A, the Crown; B, the Wand; D, the Cup; H, the Sword; R, the Rosy Cross; and refer further to Amoun the Father, Thoth His messenger, and Isis, Horus, Osiris, the divine-human triad.
*Also 418 = ATh IAV, the Essence of IAO, translated from Hebrew as “Thou art IAO”
*418= BVLShKIN, or Boleskine
*418= RA HVVR, or Ra Hoor
*418= {{Hebrew|הרו-רא-הא}}, a Hebrew spelling of ''[[Heru-Ra-Ha]]''
*418= {{lang|grc|ΑΙϜΑΣΣ}}, a Greek spelling of ''[[Aiwass]]''
*418= The sum of all integers between 13 and 31 inclusive.
*Abrahadabra is from [[Abrasax]], Father Sun, which = 365&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Crowley|1996|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 418 = 22 x 19 Manifestation

===Other interpretations===

In [[Aramaic]] this word roughly translates into "I will create as I speak."{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} (see [[Abracadabra]])

*''Had'' is the keyword of Abrahadabra. Had is another name for [[Hadit]], the second Speaker in ''Liber Legis'' ("The Book of the Law").
*"ABRAHADABRA is "The key of the rituals" because it expresses the [[magical formula|Magical Formulae]] of uniting various complementary ideas; especially the Five of the Microcosm with the Six of the Macrocosm."&lt;ref name="hermetic1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hermetic.com/220/crowley-comments.html |title=The Old and New Commentaries to Liber AL |publisher=Hermetic.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-08| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100103083639/http://hermetic.com/220/crowley-comments.html| archivedate= 3 January 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Abrahadabra is the glyph of the blending of the 5 and the 6, the Rose and the Cross."&lt;ref name="hermetic1"/&gt;

==Quotes from ''Liber Legis''==
*"Abrahadabra; the reward of Ra Hoor Khut." (AL III:1)
*"This book shall be translated into all tongues: but always with the original in the writing of the Beast; for in the chance shape of the letters and their position to one another: in these are mysteries that no Beast shall divine. Let him not seek to try: but one cometh after him, whence I say not, who shall discover the Key of it all. Then this line drawn is a key:  then this circle squared in its failure is a key also. And Abrahadabra. It shall be his child &amp; that strangely. Let him not seek after this; for thereby alone can he fall from it." (AL III:47)
*"The ending of the words is the Word Abrahadabra." (AL III:75)

'''''Against Apion''''' ({{lang-el|Φλαΐου Ἰωσήπου περὶ ἀρχαιότητος Ἰουδαίων λόγος α}} and {{lang|el|Φλαΐου Ἰωσήπου περὶ ἀρχαιότητος ἀντιρρητικὸς λόγος β}}; [[Latin]] ''Contra Apionem'' or ''In Apionem'') was a polemical work written by [[Flavius Josephus]] as a defense of [[Judaism]] as a classical religion and philosophy against criticism by [[Apion]], stressing its antiquity against what he perceived as more recent traditions of the Greeks. ''Against Apion'' cites Josephus' earlier work [[Antiquities of the Jews]], so can be dated after C.E. 94. It was most likely written in the early second century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=THACKERAY|first=H. St. J.|url=http://www.tertullian.org/rpearse/manuscripts/josephus_vita_apion.htm|title=Josephus: the Main Manuscripts of the Minor Works: The "Vita" and the "Contra Apion"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Text==
''Against Apion'' 1:8 also defines which books Josephus viewed as being in the [[Jewish Scriptures]]:

{{quote|For we have not an innumerable multitude of books among us, disagreeing from and contradicting one another, [as the Greeks have,] but only twenty-two books, (8) which contain the records of all the past times; which are justly believed to be divine; and of them five belong to Moses, which contain his laws and the traditions of the origin of mankind till his death. This interval of time was little short of three thousand years; but as to the time from the death of Moses till the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, who reigned after Xerxes, the prophets, who were after Moses, wrote down what was done in their times in thirteen books. The remaining four books contain hymns to God, and precepts for the conduct of human life. It is true, our history hath been written since Artaxerxes very particularly, but hath not been esteemed of the like authority with the former by our forefathers, because there hath not been an exact succession of prophets since that time; and how firmly we have given credit to these books of our own nation is evident by what we do; for during so many ages as have already passed, no one has been so bold as either to add any thing to them, to take any thing from them, or to make any change in them; but it is become natural to all Jews immediately, and from their very birth, to esteem these books to contain Divine doctrines, and to persist in them, and, if occasion be willingly to die for them.}}

In the second book, Josephus defends the historicity of the [[Jewish Bible]] against accusations made by [[Apion]] (who Josephus states is not Greek), arguing that Apion in fact rehashes material of [[Manetho]]'s, though there was apparently some confusion between Manetho's references to the [[Hyksos]] and the [[Hebrews]].{{clarification needed|date=April 2013}}

Josephus on Apion's [[blood libel]] (''Against Apion'' 2:8):

{{quote|Apion becomes other men's prophet upon this occasion, and says that "Antiochus found in our temple a bed, and a man lying upon it, with a small table before him, full of dainties, from the [fishes of the] sea, and the fowls of the dry land... he fell down upon his knees, and begged to be released; and that when the king bid him sit down, and tell him who he was, and why he dwelt there, and what was the meaning of those various sorts of food that were set before him the man made a lamentable complaint, and with sighs, and tears in his eyes, gave him this account of the distress he was in; and said that he was a Greek and that as he went over this province, in order to get his living, he was seized upon by foreigners, on a sudden, and brought to this temple, and shut up therein, and was seen by nobody, but was fattened by these curious provisions thus set before him; and that truly at the first such unexpected advantages seemed to him matter of great joy; that after a while, he inquired of the servants that came to him and was by them informed that it was in order to the fulfilling a law of the Jews, which they must not tell him, that he was thus fed; and that they did the same at a set time every year: that they used to catch a Greek foreigner, and fat him thus up every year, and then lead him to a certain wood, and kill him, and sacrifice with their accustomed solemnities, and taste of his entrails, and take an oath upon this sacrificing a Greek, that they would ever be at enmity with the Greeks; and that then they threw the remaining parts of the miserable wretch into a certain pit." 

Now this is such a most tragical fable as is full of nothing but cruelty and impudence; how comes it about that we take an oath, and conspire only against the Grecians, and that by the effusion of their blood also? Or how is it possible that all the Jews should get together to these sacrifices, and the entrails of one man should be sufficient for so many thousands to taste of them, as Apion pretends? Or why did not the king carry this man, whosoever he was, and whatsoever was his name, [which is not set down in Apion's book,] with great pomp back into his own country? when he might thereby have been esteemed a religious person himself, and a mighty lover of the Greeks, and might thereby have procured himself great assistance from all men against that hatred the Jews bore to him. But I leave this matter; for the proper way of confuting fools is not to use bare words, but to appeal to the things themselves that make against them...}}

[[Christianity]] has not generally practised [[aniconism]], or the avoidance or prohibition of types of images, but has had an [[Christian art|active tradition of making and venerating images]] of [[God in Christianity|God]] and other religious figures. However, there are periods of aniconism in [[History of Christianity|Christian history]], notably during the controversy of the [[Byzantine iconoclasm]] of the 8th century, and following the [[Protestant Reformation]] of the 16th century, when [[Calvinism]] in particular rejected all images in churches, and this practice continues today in Reformed (Calvinist) churches, as well as some forms of [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist Christianity]]. The [[Catholic Church]] has always defended the use of sacred images in churches, shrines, and homes, encouraging their [[dulia|veneration]] but condemning anyone who would [[latria|worship]] them as if they were gods themselves. 

The use of religious icons and images continues to be advocated at the highest level by religious leaders of major Christian denominations such as [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]], [[Methodism|Methodists]], [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]] and [[Catholicism|Catholics]].&lt;ref name="Lamport"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MCGB2018"/&gt;&lt;ref name=RWilliams83/&gt;&lt;ref name=JohnPaulAudience/&gt; The veneration of icons is also a key element of the [[doxology]] of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref name=webster231/&gt;&lt;ref name=Casiday447/&gt; The Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodox Church accept the church council which condemned iconoclasm and mandated the use of sacred images, the icons of saints, and the crucifix in churches, public shrines, and in homes. The explanation of the consistency of sacred images with the Christian religion was largely based on the arguments of [[St. John Damascene]].

Christian aniconism has only very rarely covered general secular images, unlike [[aniconism in Islam]]; [[Anabaptist]] groups such as the [[Amish]] are rare exceptions.

==Early Christianity==
{{more information|Depiction of Jesus}}
Several voices in [[Early Christianity]] expressed "grave reservations about the dangers of images",&lt;ref name="Freedberg, 176"&gt;Freedberg, 176&lt;/ref&gt; though contextualizing these remarks has often been the source of fierce controversy, as the same texts were brought out at intervals in succeeding centuries. [[Ernst Kitzinger]] described the mentions of Christian views on Christian images before the mid-6th century as "scattered and spotty",&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 95&lt;/ref&gt; and of an earlier period wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;It is a striking fact that when painting and sculpture first began to infiltrate Christian assembly rooms and cemeteries they did so practically unheeded by either opponents of or apologists for Christianity—engaged though these were in passionate disputes over idols and idolatry. No literary statement from the period prior to the year 300 would make one suspect the existence of any Christian images other than the most laconic and hieroglyphic of symbols.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

— and yet from [[archaeology]] it is clear that the use of quite complex figurative Christian images was widespread by that date. There are mentions of images of [[Jesus]] from the [[Christianity in the 2nd century|2nd century]] onwards. The [[Catacombs of Rome]] contain the earliest images, mostly painted, but also including [[relief]]s carved on [[sarcophagi]], dating from the end of the 2nd century onwards.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, 9-12&lt;/ref&gt;  Jesus is often represented by [[pictogram]] symbols, though he is also portrayed. In the [[Dura-Europos church]], of about 230-256, which of the very early churches surviving is in the best condition, there are frescos of biblical scenes including a figure of Jesus, as well as Christ as the [[Good Shepherd]].&lt;ref&gt;Graydon F. Snyder, ''Ante pacem: archaeological evidence of church life before Constantine'', p. 134, Mercer University Press, 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=swtI9Cpyl3kC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional Protestant position on the history of images in places of worship however is expressed by Phillip Schaff, &lt;blockquote&gt;'Yet previous to the time of Constantine we find no trace of an image of Christ properly speaking except among the Gnostic Carpocratians and in the case of the heathen emperor Alexander Severus who adorned his domestic chapel as a sort of pantheistic Pantheon with representatives of all religions. The above mentioned idea of the uncomely personal appearance of Jesus the entire silence of the Gospels about it and the Old Testament prohibition of images restrained the church from making either pictures or statues of Christ until the Nicene age when a great reaction in this respect took place though not without energetic and long continued opposition.&lt;ref name= "schaff"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Schaff | first = Phillip | title = History of the Christian Church | publisher = Hendrickson Publishers | location = Massachusetts | page = 381 | date = 2006 | url = 
https://books.google.com/books?id=NV8sAAAAYAAJ | isbn = 9781565631960}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Paul Corby Finney's analysis of Early Christian writing and material remains distinguishes three different sources of attitudes affecting Early Christians on the issue: "first that humans could have a direct vision of God; second that they could not; and, third, that although humans could see God they were best advised not to look, and were strictly forbidden to represent what they had seen". These derived respectively from Greek and Near Eastern pagan religions, from Ancient Greek philosophy, and from the Jewish tradition and the Old Testament. Of the three, Finney concludes that "overall, Israel's aversion to sacred images influenced early Christianity considerably less than the Greek philosophical tradition of invisible deity apophatically defined", so placing less emphasis on the [[Jewish Christianity|Jewish background]] of most of the first Christians than most traditional accounts.&lt;ref&gt;Finney, viii-xii, viii and xi quoted&lt;/ref&gt;

Images were also associated with the [[idolatry]] of the pagan [[Ancient Roman religion]] and other cults and religions around them,&lt;ref&gt;Diane Apostolos-Cappadona, et al. "Iconoclasm." In [[Grove Art Online]]. Oxford Art Online, [http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T039783 subscription required] (accessed April 26, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; and much early Christian polemic was devoted to attacking paganism for idolatry. In the [[Christianity in the 1st century|1st century]] the issues are discussed in the [[Letters of St. Paul]] and a [[Idolatry and Christianity|prohibition of idolatry]] is included in the [[Apostolic Decree]]. The objections to "decorative and symbolic devices, narrative and didactic images", a description that encompasses much though not all of the earliest Christian art, were much less, as these were not plausibly capable of "idolatric abuse"; according to Kitzinger, "much of the art of the Roman catacombs betrays a studied attempt to avoid any suspicion or encouragement of idolatric practices".&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 89&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jocelyn Toynbee]] agrees:"In two-dimensional, applied art of this kind there was never any danger of idolatry in the sense of actual worship of cult-images and votive pictures".&lt;ref&gt;Toynbee, 294-295; see also Jensen, 13-19 on the types of early images.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 4th century there are increased, if scattered, expressions of opposition to images. At the Spanish non-ecumenical [[Synod of Elvira]] (c. 305) bishops concluded, "Pictures are not to be placed in churches, so that they do not become objects of worship and adoration", the earliest such prohibition known.&lt;ref&gt;Canon 36, http://www.csun.edu/~hcfll004/elvira.html&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Eusebius]] (died 339) wrote a letter to [[Flavia Julia Constantia|Constantia]] (Emperor Constantine's sister) saying "To depict purely the human form of Christ before its transformation, on the other hand, is to break the commandment of God and to fall into pagan error";&lt;ref&gt;David M. Gwynn, From Iconoclasm to Arianism: The Construction of Christian Tradition in the Iconoclast Controversy [Greek, Roman, and Byzantine Studies 47 (2007) 225–251], p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; though this did not stop her decorating [[Santa Constanza|her mausoleum]] with such images. By the end of the century Bishop [[Epiphanius of Salamis]] (died 403) "seems to have been the first cleric to have taken up the matter of Christian religious images as a major issue".&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 92&lt;/ref&gt;  He wrote an appeal to John, Bishop of Jerusalem (c. 394) in which he recounted how he tore apart a curtain hanging on the doors of the church decorated with an image of 'Christ or one of the saints' and admonished the other bishop that such images are "opposed&amp;nbsp;... to our religion", while also replacing the curtain with another expensively embroidered one.&lt;ref&gt;Paragraph 9, [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3001051.htm letter 51]&lt;/ref&gt; Other writers cited in later controversies were [[Clement of Alexandria]], [[Tertullian]], and [[Lactantius]], although evidence of opposition to images by church leaders is often also evidence of their usage in the church.&lt;ref name="Freedberg, 176"/&gt;

It has been suggested that the question of images caused a tension in the early church between a theologically-trained clerical elite and the broad mass of followers of the church, and perhaps especially women; the letter of Eusebius being a leading piece of evidence cited here. However other scholars, including Finney and Toynbee,&lt;ref&gt;Finney, viii-xii; Toynbee, 295&lt;/ref&gt; dispute this reading of the documentary evidence, pointing out that the physical evidence of sites such as the [[Catacomb of Callistus]] suggests that "church authorities at least tolerated if not approved both the decoration and the content of the iconography on its own property over a fairly long period of time".&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, 23&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some evidence that the use of images was regarded as especially characteristic of heretics. [[Irenaeus]], (c. 130–202) in his ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Against Heresies]]'' (1:25;6) says scornfully of the Gnostic [[Carpocratians]], "They also possess images, some of them painted, and others formed from different kinds of material; while they maintain that a likeness of Christ was made by Pilate at that time when Jesus lived among them. They crown these images, and set them up along with the images of the philosophers of the world that is to say, with the images of Pythagoras, and Plato, and Aristotle, and the rest. They have also other modes of honouring these images, after the same manner of the Gentiles [pagans]". Irenaeus does not speak critically of icons or portraits in a general sense, only of certain gnostic sectarians use of icons. On the other hand, by the 8th century there is evidence that opposition to images was associated with what was by then the largely vanished heresy of [[Arianism]], though the historical evidence for this now appears slender,&lt;ref&gt;David M. Gwynn, From Iconoclasm to Arianism: The Construction of Christian Tradition in the Iconoclast Controversy [Greek, Roman, and Byzantine Studies 47 (2007) 225–251]&lt;/ref&gt; and important early figurative mosaics in Italy were created under Arian rule.

==After Constantine==
However, as Christianity increasingly spread among gentiles with traditions of religious images, and especially after the conversion of Constantine (c. 312), the legalization of Christianity, and, later that century, the establishment of Christianity as the state religion of the Roman Empire, many new people came into the new large public churches, which began to be decorated with images that certainly drew in part on imperial and pagan imagery: "The representations of Christ as the Almighty Lord on his judgment throne owed something to pictures of Zeus. Portraits of the Mother of God were not wholly independent of a pagan past of venerated mother-goddesses. In the popular mind the saints had come to fill a role that had been played by heroes and deities."&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Chadwick (theologian)|Henry Chadwick]], The Early Church (The Penguin History of the Church, 1993), 283; Hurlbut, J. L. The Story of the Christian Church. Zondervan, 1967, p.62; Loverance, Rowena (2007). Christian Art. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. p. 117. {{ISBN|978-0-674-02479-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The possibility that Christian art was a movement from below, disapproved of by the clerical hierarchy, vanishes in the large churches built with imperial patronage at the urging of that hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, 23-24&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest literary evidence of ''[[proskynesis]]'' before images comes from the first half of the 6th century;&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 94&lt;/ref&gt; it had already been common before the cross by the end of the 4th century.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 90&lt;/ref&gt;  The lighting of candles before images, and leaving lit candles and lamps (going beyond what might merely be necessary to actually see them) is mentioned in 6th century sources.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 96-97&lt;/ref&gt;

==Justinian to the Iconoclastic period==
The period after the reign of [[Justinian]] (527-565) evidently saw a huge increase in the use of images, both in volume and quality, and a gathering aniconic reaction.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 85-87; 95-115&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Kitzinger, "during the late sixth and seventh centuries devotional practices in front of images became elaborate, common, and intense".&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 99&lt;/ref&gt; In addition it was in this period that images seem to have become common in Christian homes, and "Once admitted to that sphere their use and abuse was beyond control".&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 98&lt;/ref&gt;  Literary mentions of Christian images greatly increase, in the accounts of pilgrims to the [[Holy Land]], in works of history, and in popular accounts of the lives of saints; at the same time some of these begin to mention acts of iconoclasm against images. The legendary nature of much of the last two types of material is clear, but the stories remain evidence of practices around images and beliefs as to what images were capable of.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 95-96&lt;/ref&gt;

It is this period that the attribution to individual images of the potential to achieve, channel or display various forms of spiritual grace or divine power becomes a regular motif in literature. In the many miracle stories, there is a "tendency to break down the barrier between image and prototype", so that "the image acts or behaves as the subject itself is expected to act or behave. It makes known its wishes&amp;nbsp;... It enacts evangelical teachings,&amp;nbsp;... When attacked it bleeds,&amp;nbsp;... [and] In some cases it defends itself against infidels with physical force&amp;nbsp;...".&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 101&lt;/ref&gt;  Images make promises, and demand that promises made by others are kept, are immune to attack, and most commonly of all, images bestow "some kind of material benefit upon&amp;nbsp;... votaries".&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 102&lt;/ref&gt;  The most famous example of this is the role ascribed to the [[Image of Edessa]] (or Mandylion) in the failure of the Persian siege of the city in 544. The image is not mentioned in the account of [[Procopius]], writing soon after the event, but first appears as the agent of the failure in the history of [[Evagrius Scholasticus]] of about 593.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 103-104&lt;/ref&gt;  Though most often images are described as acting through some kind of intermediary, sometimes direct physical contact produces the benefit, as with a dry well that refilled when an icon was lowered in the bucket, or medical benefit ascribed to drinking some ground-up plaster from a fresco in water.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 105-107 and note&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 6th century [[Julian of Atramytion]] objected to sculpture, but not paintings, which is effectively the Orthodox position to the present day, except for small works.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 94-95 (with long note); Freedberg, 170&lt;/ref&gt;

== Byzantine iconoclasm ==
[[File:Irenekirken.jpg|thumb|A simple cross replaced a mosaic figure during the [[Byzantine iconoclasm]], [[Hagia Irene]] Church in Istanbul]]
{{Main article|Byzantine iconoclasm}}

There were two periods of [[iconoclasm]], or image destruction, in the [[Byzantine Empire]], in the mid eighth and early ninth centuries. The arguments of the Iconoclasts remain rather obscure, as almost all their writings were [[book burning |destroyed]] after the "[[Triumph of Orthodoxy]]". The simple belief that images were idolatrous appears to have been their main motive; reference was made to the prohibitions on the worship of graven images in the [[Ten Commandments|Mosaic Law]], and aniconic statements by the [[Church Fathers]], some of which may now be lost. One theological issue revolved around the two natures of [[Jesus]]. Iconoclasts believed that icons could not represent both the divine and the human natures of the Messiah at the same time, but separately. Because an icon which depicted Jesus as purely physical would be [[Nestorianism]], and one which showed Him as both human and divine would not be able to do so without confusing the two natures into one mixed nature, which was [[Monophysitism]], all icons were thus heretical.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Cormack, ''Writing in Gold, Byzantine Society and its Icons'', pp.&amp;nbsp;95–96, 106-118, 1985, George Philip, London, {{ISBN|0-540-01085-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mango, Cyril, "Historical Introduction," in Bryer &amp; Herrin, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–6, "Chronology", pp.&amp;nbsp;178–179, "Anthology of Texts in Translation", pp.&amp;nbsp;180–186&lt;/ref&gt;

The political aspects of the conflicts are complex, involving with the relationship between the Byzantine Emperors, the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]] councils, and the Pope. There has been much scholarly discussion over the possible influence on the Iconoclasts of the [[aniconism in Islam]], the century-old  religion which had inflicted devastating defeats on Byzantium in the decades preceding. Most scholars reject direct religious influence, though many feel the feeling of crisis produced by defeats at the hands of Islam contributed to the Iconoclast movement. Both the cross and secular two-dimensional images continued to be acceptable, indeed were used to replace religious imagery in the two best-known examples. The defeat of Byzantine Iconoclasm was so emphatic that the issue has never arisen again in Orthodoxy.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Cormack, ''Writing in Gold, Byzantine Society and its Icons'', pp.&amp;nbsp;98–106, 1985, George Philip, London, {{ISBN|0-540-01085-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==After Iconoclasm==
Figurative [[monumental sculpture]] was still avoided in the [[Western Christianity|West]] until the time of [[Charlemagne]] around 800; the [[Franks]] had no association of sculpture with cult images and a life-size [[crucifix]] (with "corpus") known to have been in the [[Palatine Chapel, Aachen]] was probably a pivotal work, opening the way to the free general use of large sculpture. This was contemporary with the [[Byzantine iconoclasm]] (see below). Religious sculpture, especially if large and free-standing, has always been extremely rare in [[Eastern Christianity]]. The Western church was anxious to distinguish its use of images from idolatry, and set out its theological position in the Carolingian [[Libri Carolini]], in similar but slightly different terms to those set out by the Eastern church after the episode of Iconoclasm.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, C.R.; ''The Pictorial arts of the West, 800-1200'', pp.&amp;nbsp;32–33, 1993, Yale UP, {{ISBN|0-300-06493-4}}; Schiller, 140&lt;/ref&gt;

In his travels through the [[Auvergne]] between 1007 and 1020 the cleric Bernard of Angers was initially disapproving of the large crucifixes with a sculpted three-dimensional ''corpus'', and other religious statues that he saw, but he came to accept them.  The [[Gero Cross]], the earliest life-size crucifix image to survive, probably dates to around 960.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 140-141&lt;/ref&gt;  

===God the Father===
The depiction of [[God the Father in Western art|God the Father in art]] long remained unacceptable; he was typically only shown with the features of Jesus, which had become fairly standardized by the 6th century, in scenes such as the [[Garden of Eden]]. The rationale for this was the doctrine of the pre-existing Christ or ''[[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]]'', which holds that Christ has existed from the beginning of time. Very simply put, as a member of the [[Holy Trinity]] of three persons in one God, representations of God could be achieved by depicting Jesus as ''Logos'', except in the few cases where both Jesus and God the Father needed to be shown separately, as in scenes of the [[Baptism of Jesus]]. Alternatively God the Father was represented only by the [[Hand of God (art)|Hand of God]], which probably reached [[Christian art]] from [[Hellenistic Judaism]], as it is prominent in the wall paintings of the 3rd century [[Dura-Europos synagogue]] in [[Syria]]. Depictions of God the Father, essentially as the [[Old Testament]] [[Ancient of Days]], only became common in the West from about 1200 onwards, and remain controversial in Eastern Orthodoxy, still being prohibited by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] for example (where images of the Ancient of Days, also banned, are held to represent Christ). Free-standing monumental sculpture is also avoided by the Orthodox churches, and reliefs are much rarer, especially large ones. On the other hand, [[icon]]s have a slightly different theological position in Orthodoxy and play a more significant part in religious life than in [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]], let alone the Protestant churches.

===Bernard of Clairvaux===
[[Bernard of Clairvaux]] (1090–1153) was an influential [[Cistercian]] monk who famously wrote against the excessive use of imagery in a monastic context, and was largely responsible for the unornamented style of [[Cistercian architecture]]. However his attack concentrated on what he saw as frivolous non-religious elements in the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] religious art of his day, which he said distracted monks from their religious life.&lt;ref&gt;"But in the cloister, in the sight of the reading monks, what is the point of such ridiculous monstrosity, the strange kind of shapely shapelessness? Why these unsightly monkeys, why these fierce lions, why the monstrous centaurs, why semi-humans, why spotted tigers, why fighting soldiers, why trumpeting huntsmen?&amp;nbsp;... In short there is such a variety and such a diversity of strange shapes everywhere that we may prefer to read the marbles rather than the books."{{Citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p8csPCj2hPcC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=Bernard+of+Clairvaux+decoration|title=Bernard's letter |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= 2006-01-01|accessdate=2011-06-11|isbn=978-1-888570-85-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, he was prepared to sacrifice religious imagery also, both to save money and avoid "distractions of the senses",&lt;ref name="Freedberg, 176"/&gt;

==Among Nestorians==
In the [[Church of the East]], also known as the Nestorian church, opposition to religious images eventually became the norm due to the [[rise of Islam]] in the region, where it forbade any type of depictions of Saints and [[biblical prophets]]. As such, the Church was forced to get rid of their icons.&lt;ref name="Nestorian"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.touchstonemag.com/archives/article.php?id=21-05-027-f|title=The Shadow of Nestorius}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|The Reformation and art}}

Opposition to religious imagery was a feature of proto-Protestant movements such as the [[Lollards]] in England.

The [[Reformation]] produced two main branches of Protestant Christianity; one was the Evangelical Lutheran churches, which followed the teachings of [[Martin Luther]], and the other the [[Reformed Churches]], which followed the ideas of [[John Calvin]] and [[Huldrych Zwingli]].  Out of these branches grew three main sects, the [[Lutheran]] tradition, as well as the [[Continental Reformed]] and [[Anglican]] traditions, the latter two following the Reformed (Calvinist) faith. Lutherans and Reformed Christians had different views regarding religious imagery.&lt;ref name="Nuechterlein2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nuechterlein|first=Jeanne Elizabeth|title=Holbein and the Reformation of Art|accessdate=29 April 2018|year=2000|publisher=University of California, Berkeley|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lamport2017"/&gt;

On the contrary, at the time of the Reformation, [[Calvinist]]s preached in violent terms the rejection of what they perceived as idolatrous Catholic practices such as religious pictures, statues, or relics of saints, as well as against the [[Lutheran]] retention of [[sacred art]].&lt;ref name="Lamport2017"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lamport|first=Mark A.|title=Encyclopedia of Martin Luther and the Reformation|date=31 August 2017|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|language=English|isbn=9781442271593|page=138|quote=Lutherans continued to worship in pre-Reformation churches, generally with few alterations to the interior. It has even been suggested that in Germany to this day one finds more ancient Marian altarpieces in Lutheran than in Catholic churches. Thus in Germany and in Scandinavia many pieces of medieval art and architecture survived. Joseph Leo Koerner has noted that Lutherans, seeing themselves in the tradition of the ancient, apostolic church, sought to defend as well as reform the use of images. "An empty, white-washed church proclaimed a wholly spiritualized cult, at odds with Luther's doctrine of Christ's real presence in the sacraments" (Koerner 2004, 58). In fact, in the 16th century some of the strongest opposition to destruction of images came not from Catholics but from Lutherans against Calvinists: "You black Calvinist, you give permission to smash our pictures and hack our crosses; we are going to smash you and your Calvinist priests in return" (Koerner 2004, 58). Works of art continued to be displayed in Lutheran churches, often including an imposing large crucifix in the sanctuary, a clear reference to Luther's ''theologia crucis''. ... In contrast, Reformed (Calvinist) churches are strikingly different. Usually unadorned and somewhat lacking in aesthetic appeal, pictures, sculptures, and ornate altar-pieces are largely absent; there are few or no candles; and crucifixes or crosses are also mostly absent.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andreas Karlstadt]] was the earliest extreme iconoclast, to be followed by [[Huldrych Zwingli]] and [[John Calvin]]. The Reformed (Calvinist) churches (including the Anglican, [[Puritan]]/[[Congregational]] and [[Reformed Baptist]] Churches) completely prohibited the display of religious images. Reformed theologians such as [[Francis Turretin]], [[Theodore Beza]], [[Westminster divines|the Divines of the Westminster Assembly]], and later [[Robert Dabney]] and [[John Murray (theologian)|John Murray]],&lt;ref name="the-highway"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-highway.com/pictures_Murray.html |title= Murray on pictures of Christ |publisher=the-highway.com|accessdate=2015-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  explicitly reject the depiction of Christ, citing arguments drawn from the second commandment, as well as writings of the early church, using the same texts and arguments as Byzantine iconoclasts.&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 165(quoted)-166, 167-173&lt;/ref&gt; The Calvinist [[Westminster Larger Catechism]] of 1647 asks in Question 109, 'What are the sins forbidden in the second commandment?
Answer: The sins forbidden in the second commandment are, all devising, counseling, commanding, using, and anywise approving, any religious worship not instituted by God himself; tolerating a false religion; the making any representation of God, of all or of any of the three persons, either inwardly in our mind, or outwardly in any kind of image or likeness of any creature'.

Apart from official destruction of art, there were outbreaks of violent Calvinist [[iconoclasm]] such as the [[Beeldenstorm]] in the [[Low Countries]] in 1566. During this time, [[Anglicanism]], falling with the broader Reformed tradition, also removed most religious images and symbols from churches and discouraged their private use. [[Elizabeth I of England]] was one of many Anglicans to exhibit somewhat contradictory attitudes, both ordering a [[crucifix]] for her chapel when they were against a law she had approved, and objecting forcefully when the [[Dean of St Paul's]] put in the royal pew a service book with "[[woodcut|cuts]] resembling angels and saints, nay, grosser absurdities, pictures resembling the Holy [[Trinity]]".&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 175&lt;/ref&gt;  Many Reformed churches are now considerably more relaxed over the use of religious art and symbols than they were in the Reformation period, though many denominations avoid images in churches, and in the Anglican Church matters such as the use of altar crosses and crucifixes can arouse strong feelings. However while portraits of saints were destroyed, portraits of contemporary individuals, including church leaders, were not considered problematic, and exist in large numbers. Reformed Christians did not object to small religious images, typically of episodes from the [[New Testament]], in the form of [[old master print|prints]], and Bible illustrations or picture books, especially those intended for children, were and continue to be widely used in Protestantism,&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Inventing the Holy Land: American Protestant Pilgrimage to Palestine, 1865–1941|author=Rogers, S.S.|date=2011|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=9780739148440|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eeMlQ4xgB60C|page=24|accessdate=2015-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  so that in the 17th century, even "the ordinary Puritan enjoyed a Bible with pictures".&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=From Sacred to Secular: Visual Images in Early American Publications|author=Lacey, B.E.|date=2007|publisher=University of Delaware Press|isbn=9780874139617|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8VXsjvrmMvAC|page=17|accessdate=2015-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Faced with the Protestant challenge to imagery, then far more virulent than it usually is today, the Catholic [[Counter-Reformation]] reacted by quietly removing some types of medieval imagery that could not be justified theologically, but otherwise by strengthening its commitment to the use of art and images to promote the Christian message, though tightening up on the detailed content of imagery, which was brought under stricter control by the church.&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 176-177&lt;/ref&gt;

The virtual end of the production of religious painting in Reformed parts of Europe had the effect of diverting artistic production into secular subjects, especially in [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] of the 17th century. While Catholic Europe was still producing [[Baroque]] altarpieces in large numbers, the Netherlands produced genre scenes, very often of ungodly behavior, still lifes, portraits and landscapes. Moralistic messages were often attached to these, though the subject matter often fights somewhat with them. Protestant religious art, mainly in the form of illustrations of biblical events, continued in [[printmaking]] and book illustrations, for example in the [[etching]]s of [[Rembrandt]], who also painted biblical subjects. In the early stages of the Reformation, Protestant propagandists made vigorous use of images satirizing their opponents.

Lutheran Churches continue to be ornate, with respect to sacred art:&lt;ref name="MarmionRyan2017"/&gt;
{{quotation|Lutheran places of worship contain images and sculptures not only of Christ but also of biblical and occasionally of other saints as well as prominent decorated pulpits due to the importance of preaching, stained glass, ornate furniture, magnificent examples of traditional and modern architecture, carved or otherwise embellished altar pieces, and liberal use of candles on the altar and elsewhere.&lt;ref name="MarmionRyan2017"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marmion|first1=Declan|last2=Ryan|first2=Salvador|last3=Thiessen|first3=Gesa E.|title=Remembering the Reformation: Martin Luther and Catholic Theology|date=1 February 2017|publisher=Fortress Press|language=English|isbn=9781506423289|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Calvinist aniconism, especially in printed material, and stained glass, can generally be said to have weakened in force, although the range and context of images used are much more restricted than in Catholicism, Lutheranism, or parts of Anglicanism, the latter of which also incorporated many high church practices after the [[Oxford Movement]].{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

'''Apollodorus of Athens''' ({{lang-el|Ἀπολλόδωρος ὁ Ἀθηναῖος}}, ''Apollodōros ho Athēnaios''; c. 180 BC – after 120 BC) son of [[Asclepiades Pharmacion|Asclepiades]], was a [[Greeks|Greek]] scholar, historian and grammarian. He was a pupil of [[Diogenes of Babylon]], [[Panaetius|Panaetius the Stoic]], and the grammarian [[Aristarchus of Samothrace]]. He left (perhaps fled) [[Alexandria]] around 146 BC, most likely for [[Pergamon]], and eventually settled in [[Athens]].

==Literary works==
* ''Chronicle'' (''Χρονικά''), a Greek history in verse from the fall of [[Troy]] in the 12th century BC to roughly 143 BC (although later it was extended as far as 109 BC), and based on previous works by [[Eratosthenes|Eratosthenes of Cyrene]].  Its dates are reckoned by its references to the [[archons of Athens]].  As most archons only held office for one year, scholars have been able to pin down the years to which Apollodorus was referring.  The poem is written in comic [[trimeter]]s and is dedicated to the second century BC king of Pergamon, [[Attalus II Philadelphus]].
* ''On the Gods'' (''Περὶ θεῶν'', ''Peri theon'', prose, in 24 books), lost but known through quotes to have included [[Etymology | etymologies]]&lt;ref&gt;Dignified as "philological inquiries" by Fritz Graf, ''Greek Mythology: an introduction'' 1996:276.&lt;/ref&gt; of the names and [[epithet]]s of the gods, rifled and quoted by the Roman Epicurean [[Philodemus]] ; further fragments appear in [[Oxyrhynchus papyri]].
* A twelve-book essay about Homer's [[Catalogue of Ships]], also based on [[Eratosthenes|Eratosthenes of Cyrene]] and [[Demetrius of Scepsis]], dealing with Homeric geography and how it has changed along the centuries.  [[Strabo]] relied greatly on this for books 8 through 10 of his own ''[[Geographica (Strabo)|Geographica]]''.
* Other possible works include an early [[wikt:etymology|etymology]] (possibly the earliest by an Alexandrian writer), and analyses of the poets [[Epicharmus of Kos]] and [[Sophron]].
* Apollodorus produced numerous other critical and grammatical writings, which have not survived.
* His eminence as a scholar gave rise to several imitations, forgeries and misattributions.  The encyclopedia of [[Greek mythology]] called ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'', or ''Library'', was traditionally attributed to him, but it cannot be his; as it cites authors who wrote centuries later. Rather, the author of the ''Bibliotheca'' is now designated [[Pseudo-Apollodorus]].

{{Women in society sidebar}}
One of the fundamental teachings of the [[Bahá'í Faith]] is that men and women are [[gender equality|equal]], and that equality of the sexes is a spiritual and moral standard that is essential for the unification of the planet and the unfoldment of [[peace]]. Bahá'í teachings note the importance of implementing this principle in individual, family, and community life. Nevertheless, the Bahá'í notion of the full spiritual and social equality of the two sexes does not imply sameness, so that gender distinction and differentiation are observed in certain areas of life. For example, while women can and do serve in an extensive range of elected and appointed positions within the faith at both national and international levels, they are not permitted to serve as members of the [[Universal House of Justice]], the supreme governing institution of the Bahá'í Faith. Furthermore, the education of daughters is held to be more important than, and therefore to take precedence over, that of sons.

==Equality==
The equality of [[men]] and [[women]] is a fundamental [[Bahá'í teachings|Bahá'í principle]],&lt;ref name="Buck296"&gt;{{Harvnb|Buck|1999|p=296}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is explicit in the writings of [[Bahá'u'lláh]], the founder of the Bahá'í Faith, and particularly in the writings and discourses of [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], his son and chosen interpreter.&lt;ref name="Buck296"/&gt; The teaching and its vision of the community is central to Bahá'í community life as is implemented at a practical level.&lt;ref name="Buck296"/&gt; The Bahá'í teachings state that women are not inferior to men, and should not be subordinate to men in aspects of social life.&lt;ref name="Hatcher"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hatcher|Martin|1998|pp=90–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Bahá'í view, women have always been equal to men, and the reason why women have so far not achieved this equality is due to the lack of adequate [[education]]al and social opportunities, and because men have used their greater physical strength to prevent women from developing their true potential.&lt;ref name="Hatcher"/&gt;

===Spiritual station===
Bahá'u'lláh noted that there was no distinction in the spiritual stations of men and women,&lt;ref name="Smith143"&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that women and men were equal in the sight of God.&lt;ref name="Smith144"&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahá'u'lláh wrote:
{{quote|Exalted, immensely exalted is He Who hath removed differences and established harmony...[T]he Pen of the Most High hath lifted distinctions from between His servants and handmaidens and ... hath conferred upon all a station and rank on the same plane.&lt;ref name="Buck296"/&gt;}}

Instead of their [[gender]], Bahá'u'lláh wrote that the spiritual station of each person depends on their recognition and devotion to God.&lt;ref name="Smith144"/&gt; `Abdu'l-Bahá stated that God did not differentiate between people based on gender and that all were made in the image of God. He further stated that both women and men have the same potential for intelligence, virtue and prowess.&lt;ref name="Smith144"/&gt;

===Advancement of humanity and prerequisite to peace===
`Abdu'l-Bahá stated that [[gender equality]] was not simply righting historical social injustices against women, but would serve as a key factor in wide-ranging societal changes that would help develop a new civilization in which more 'feminine' qualities such as tender-heartedness and receptivity would balance previously dominant 'masculine' forces.&lt;ref name="Smith144"/&gt; The Bahá'í writings state that until women are provided equal status to men, humanity cannot advance or progress.&lt;ref name="Smith144"/&gt; `Abdu'l-Bahá in a series of analogies has compared men and women to the two wings of a [[bird]] and the two hands of a human body and stated that both need to be strong to allow for advancement.&lt;ref name="Smith144"/&gt; `Abdu'l-Baha wrote:

{{quote|The world of humanity is possessed of two wings: the male and the female. So long as these two wings are not equivalent in strength, the bird will not fly. Until womankind reaches the same degree as man, until she enjoys the same arena of activity, extraordinary attainment for humanity will not be realized; humanity cannot wing its way to heights of real attainment. When the two wings or parts become equivalent in strength, enjoying the same prerogatives, the flight of man will be exceedingly lofty and extraordinary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|`Abdu'l-Bahá|1912|p=108}} quoted in {{Harvnb|Stetzer|2007|pp=116–117}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Both Bahá'u'lláh and `Abdu'l-Bahá wrote that an important aspect of world unity will be a greater balance between feminine and masculine influences on society, and stated that because of the greater feminine influence that wars will cease and a permanent [[peace]] attained.&lt;ref name="Hatcher"/&gt;  `Abdu'l-Bahá wrote that women, as mothers, would be a force in establishing peace as they would oppose sending their children to war.&lt;ref name="Smith145"&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; `Abdu'l-Bahá wrote:

{{quote|War and its ravages have blighted the world; the education of woman will be a mighty step toward its abolition and ending, for she will use her whole influence against war. Woman rears the child and educates the youth to maturity. She will refuse to give her sons for sacrifice upon the field of battle. In truth, she will be the greatest factor in establishing universal peace and international arbitration. Assuredly, woman will abolish warfare among mankind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|`Abdu'l-Bahá|1912|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Moojan Momen]] writes that the goal of achieving equality of women and men in the Bahá'í Faith does not amount to bringing women into power in masculine roles, but instead a more radical change to the very nature of society, to make feminine qualities more valued.&lt;ref name="In all the Ways"&gt;{{Harvnb|Momen|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education of women===
In the Bahá'í view, women have always been equal to men, and the reason why women have not achieved this equality yet is because of the lack of adequate [[education]]al and social opportunities.&lt;ref name="Hatcher"/&gt; Thus Bahá'í teachings stress the need for women's education, not only as a means to increase opportunity for women to help achieve equality, but also since the education of mothers is essential to the proper upbringing of children.&lt;ref name="Maneck17"&gt;{{Harvnb|Maneck|2005|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of the importance of the education of women, the education of daughters takes precedence over that of sons when financial resources do not exist to educate all of the children of a family.&lt;ref name="Maneck17"/&gt; Despite the linkage between motherhood and education, `Abdu'l-Bahá encouraged women to excel in [[arts]] and [[sciences]], and stated that women's participation in the political sphere would be a prerequisite for peace.&lt;ref name="Maneck17"/&gt;

== Dignity of Women in the Bahá'í Faith ==
Over a century ago, Bahá’u'lláh, the Prophet-Founder of the Bahá’í Faith,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-05-24|title=Bahá'í Faith|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD_Faith&amp;oldid=842750914|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; proclaimed the equality of man and woman. He did not leave this pronouncement as an ideal or pious hope but wove it, as a core element, into the fabric of His social order. He supported it by laws requiring the same standard of education for women as for men, and equality of rights in society. The Baha'i concept of the equality of women and men must be understood in the context of the pivotal principle of the Baha'i Faith—the oneness of humankind. It is a principle that addresses itself to relationships at all levels of society: relationships between individuals, within the family, within the community; relationships between individuals and their respective communities and social institutions; relationships between individuals and the natural environment; as well as relationships among nation states. The vision and the very goal of the Baha'i Faith is the creation of conditions—social, spiritual, and material—that enable the oneness of humanity to be expressed in the structure and relationships at all levels of society.&lt;blockquote&gt;"Women have equal rights with men upon earth; in religion and society they are a very important element. As long as women are prevented from attaining their highest possibilities, so long will men be unable to achieve the greatness which might be theirs.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bahai.org/library/authoritative-texts/abdul-baha/promulgation-universal-peace/promulgation-universal-peace.pdf?91be78c7|title=The Promulgation of Universal Peace|last=Abdu'l-Baha|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''"''The world of humanity has two wings—one is women and the other men. Not until both wings are equally developed can the bird fly. Should one wing remain weak, flight is impossible. Not until the world of women becomes equal to the world of men in the acquisition of virtues and perfections, can success and prosperity be attained as they ought to be.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bahai.org/library/authoritative-texts/abdul-baha/selections-writings-abdul-baha/selections-writings-abdul-baha.pdf?91a0669b|title=Selections from the Writings of Abdu’l-Baha|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Historical women figures in Bahá'í history==
There have been a large number of women heroines who are celebrated in the history of the Bahá'í Faith including [[Khadíjih-Bagum]], [[Táhirih]], [[Ásiyih Khánum|Navváb]], [[Princess Marie of Edinburgh|Queen Marie]], [[Bahíyyih Khánum]], [[Martha Root]], [[Leonora Armstrong]], [[Lidia Zamenhof]], and many others.

===Táhirih===
{{main|Táhirih}}
Táhirih was an influential poet and follower of the [[Bábís|Bábí]] faith, the predecessor to the Bahá'í Faith, and often mentioned in Bahá'í literature as an example of courage in the struggle for women's rights.  While the writings of Táhirih do not address the issue of women's rights precisely,  Táhirih experienced the [[Báb|Báb's]] revelation as liberating, and broke with Islamic practices that were expected of women, such as appearing in public without a veil at the [[Conference of Badasht]].&lt;ref name="maneck1994"&gt;{{Harvnb|Maneck|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her actions which were out of norm caused controversy in the community and some saw her as scandalous or unchaste.  To combat the attitudes of the community against Táhirih, the Báb gave her the title Táhirih, meaning the "pure."&lt;ref name="maneck1994"/&gt; An unverified quote has been attributed to Táhirih by `Abdu'l-Bahá &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Universal House of Justice|first1=on behalf of|title=Tahirih and Women's Suffrage|journal=Baha'i Studies Bulletin|date=1988|volume=4|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; about her final utterance in 1852: "You can kill me as soon as you like, but you cannot stop the emancipation of women." According to some scholars this quote is "perhaps apocryphal".&lt;ref name="maneck1994"/&gt;

===Bahíyyih Khánum===
[[File:Bahiyyih khanum 1895.jpg|thumb|Bahíyyih Khánum in 1895]]
{{main|Bahíyyih Khánum}}
Bahíyyih Khánum was born in 1846 and was the eldest daughter of Bahá'u'lláh and Ásíyih Khánum.&lt;ref name="PSmithBahiyyih"&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2000|pp=86–87}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was entitled ''the Greatest holy Leaf''.&lt;ref name="Bramson"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bramson|2004|pp=102–103}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was particularly dear to her father and is seen within the Bahá'í Faith as one of the greatest women to have lived.&lt;ref name="Bramson"/&gt; During [[World War I]], she distributed food, clothing and medical aid to the local population suffering from starvation.&lt;ref name="PSmithBahiyyih"/&gt; During the periods her brother was away in America, and after his death when [[Shoghi Effendi]] was named the head of the religion, but away on retreats, Bahíyyih Khánum was empowered as the acting leader of the Bahá'í Faith, which was a rare position for a woman to be in at that time.&lt;ref name="PSmithBahiyyih"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bramson"/&gt; She died on 15 July 1932 was buried in the Bahá'í gardens below the [[Arc (Bahá'í)|Bahá'í Arc]] on Mount Carmel; the [[Monument Gardens|Monument of the Greatest Holy Leaf]] was built in her memory at the [[Bahá'í World Centre buildings|Bahá'í World Centre]].&lt;ref name="PSmithBahiyyih"/&gt;

==Serving in administration==
In terms of Bahá'í administration, all positions except for membership on the [[Universal House of Justice]] are open to men and women.  No specific reason has been given for this exception, but `Abdu'l-Bahá has stated that there is a wisdom for it, which would eventually become clear.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter | authorlink= Peter Smith (historian) |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= Women |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |pages= 143, 359}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only other field where `Abdu'l-Baha did not extend full and equal participation to women was in military endeavors, since he regarded the taking of human life incompatible with women's role as mothers.

There are two branches of [[Bahá'í administration]] - appointed and elected.

===Appointed===
====Hands of the Cause====
{{main|Hands of the Cause}}
Hands of the Cause were a select group of [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]], appointed for life, whose main function was to propagate and protect the [[Bahá'í Faith]]. Unlike the members of the [[Bahá'í administration#Elected institutions|elected institutions]] and other [[Bahá'í administration#Appointed institutions|appointed institutions]] in the Bahá'í Faith, who serve in those offices, these are considered to have demonstrated sincerity and praiseworthy morals and qualities and achieved a distinguished rank in service to the religion and an overall station above a [[National Spiritual Assembly]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://bahai-library.com/hornby_lights_guidance_2&amp;chapter=2#1079 (Hornby (1983), #1079, # 1086, p. 322, 324)]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as individual members of the Universal House of Justice - indeed it is the highest station that could be achieved open to anyone in the religion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IL7Wge7igZIC&amp;lpg=PA131&amp;ots=RrckDa-0JF&amp;pg=PA132#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Advancement of women: a Baháʾí perspective] By Janet Adrienne Khan, [[Peter Khan]]&lt;/ref&gt; The title is no longer given out. The work of the Hands of the Cause is now carried out by the [[Institution of the Counsellors|Continental Counsellors]] and the Auxiliary Boards.

Eight out of the fifty known Hands of the Cause were women (in order of appointment):

* [[Keith Ransom-Kehler]] (1876-1933) (singled out as the first woman Hand of the Cause and first American martyr)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia| title = Ransom-Kehler, Keith Bean (1876–1933)| encyclopedia = The Bahá'í Encyclopedia Project | volume = Online | publisher = National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of the United States | year = 2009 |url = http://www.bahai-encyclopedia-project.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=73:ransom-kehler-keith-bean&amp;catid=37:biography| accessdate = 2010-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Martha Root]] (1872-1939) (singled out as the foremost Hand of the Cause of the first Bahá'í century and the "first finest fruit" of the Formative Age.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | last = Research Department of the Universal House of Justice  | title = M E M O R A N D U M  | work = Documents from the Universal House of Justice  | publisher = Bahá'í Library Online  | date = 11 August 1998  | url = http://bahai-library.com/uhj_mazandarani_hand_cause  | accessdate = 2010-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Studying the Writings of Shoghi Effendi | chapter = The Life of Shoghi Effendi | first = Helen | last = Danesh |author2= Danesh, John|author3= Danesh, Amelia | publisher = George Ronald | year = 1991 | isbn = 0-85398-336-4|editor = M.

* [[Dorothy Beecher Baker]] (1898–1954)
* [[Amelia Engelder Collins]] (1873–1962)
* [[Clara Dunn]] (1869–1960)
* [[Corinne Knight True]] (1861–1961)
* [[Rúhíyyih Khánum]] (1910–2000)
* [[Agnes Baldwin Alexander]] (1875–1971)

During the period between the death of Shoghi Effendi and the election of the Universal House of Justice the Hands of the Cause held a convocation from which they constituted a body of nine from among their number to serve in the Holy Land and to act as Custodians of the Bahá’í Faith, a body which functioned without officers and with a quorum of five, whose duties included taking care of Bahá’í World Center properties and other assets; corresponding with and advising National and Regional Spiritual Assemblies; acting on behalf of the Bahá’í Faith for its protection; and maintaining close contact with the rest of the Hands, who would henceforth devote their time to the successful completion of the goals of the [[Ten Year Crusade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia  | title = Hands of the Cause of God (in Arabic: Ayádí Amru’lláh)  | encyclopedia = Bahá’í Encyclopedia Project | url = http://www.bahai-encyclopedia-project.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=64:hands-of-the-cause-of-god&amp;catid=36:administrationinstitutions  | volume = Online  | publisher = National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of the United States  | year = 2009  | accessdate = 2010-08-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hands of the Cause maintained the number of Custodians, replacing those who died or were unable, for health or personal reasons, to remain at the Bahá’í World Center permanently. Of these nine, 2 women served as Custodians: Amelia Collins and Rúhíyyih Khánum.

====International Bahá'í Council====
{{main|International Bahá'í Council}}
The International Bahá'í Council was nine member council as a precursor to the Universal House of Justice, which replaced it in 1963. In March 1951 Shoghi Effendi began appointing its membership&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book

====Continental Counsellors====
{{main|Institution of the Counsellors}}
After the election of the Universal House of Justice, Boards of Counsellors were created in 1973 by appointment who outrank the national assemblies, though individually Counsellors ranked lower than that of the Hands of the Cause.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bahai-library.com/hornby_lights_guidance_2&amp;chapter=2#1091 (Hornby (1983), #1091, #1094, p. 326)]&lt;/ref&gt; There are 90 counsellors - 81 serving on continental boards and 9 serving at the [[International Teaching Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Stockman | first = Robert | editor-last =  Melton | editor-first = J.

The percent of women serving as counselors rose from 24% of 63 counselors in 1980 to 48% of 81 counselors serving worldwide.&lt;ref name="Women Serving as"/&gt;

===Elected===
Women serve on National Assemblies. Bahá'í elections are secret ballots and electees are chosen without running for office on [[Bahá'í administration#Elections|plurality]] up to the number of members of the institution. That women could be elected was in development by 1909 when the Baha'i temple unity executive board was elected in the United States. Of the nine members chosen, three were women, with Corinne True (later appointed as a Hand of the Cause) serving as an officer.&lt;ref name="wabf"&gt;{{Cite book| editor-last =  Sharma| editor-first = Arvind | last = Maneck| first = Susan | title = Religion and women | publisher =SUNY Press|year = 1994 | location = | pages = 211–228| chapter =Women in the Bahá'í Faith | chapterurl =https://books.google.com/books?id=2Oeq-yXuJrYC&amp;lpg=PA256&amp;pg=PA211#v=onepage| url = https://books.google.com/?id=2Oeq-yXuJrYC| isbn = 978-0-7914-1689-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The all-male administrative bodies finally were completely dissolved by `Abdu'l-Bahá in his [[`Abdu'l-Bahá's journeys to the West#Journey of `Abdu'l-Bahá to America|visit to America]] in 1912. By 1925 the executive board evolved into the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the United States and Canada. There were specific developments in the eastern Bahá'í communities in 1951. At this time women were allowed to be and were [[Bahá'í administration#Elections|elected]] according to the rules of Bahá'í administration to local assemblies of the [[Bahá'í Faith in Egypt]].&lt;ref name="51info"&gt;{{cite journal| title = International News; Egypt and the Sudan: National Election | journal = Bahá'í News |date=September 1951 | issue = 247 | page = 6 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; (indeed some were elected officers in 1952.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = International News; Women in the News | journal = Bahá'í News |date=September 1952 | issue = 259 | page = 6 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as late as the 1970s one observer could only count two women delegates out of the more than one hundred attending the national Baha'i convention in Teheran. Yet when the members of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Iran were arrested and executed in 1981, the chairperson was a woman, Zhinus Mahmudi.&lt;ref name="wabf"/&gt; However a statistical review across continents and for the Baha'is world population shows a general upward track of women being elected to national assemblies (see graphs.) A similar pattern exists for women serving in appointed positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Universal House of Justice | authorlink =Universal House of Justice | title =Percentage of Women Serving as Continental Counselors or in the International Teaching Centre: 1980-2010 | work =Letters from the Universal House of Justice | publisher =Bahai-library.com | date =2013-01-23 | url =http://bahai-library.com/uhj_percentage_women_itc | format = pdf | accessdate = 2013-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tarbiyat School, Tehran, ca 1911.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|left|Students of ''School for Girls'', Tehran, 13 August 1933. The school was closed by government decree in 1934. Source: [http://denial.bahai.org/003.php ''History of Bahá'í Educational Efforts in Iran''].]]
The Bahá'í Faith's emphasis is on male-female equality and thus the Bahá'í Faith actively promotes a number of programs with the aim of the advancement of women with greater access for women to health, education, child-care, and business opportunities.&lt;ref name="Smith360"&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2000|p=360}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1900s Bahá'í women became active in seeking advancement and were encouraged by `Abdu'l-Baha and were thus able to gain a position of equality in [[Bahá'í administration]].&lt;ref name="Smith359"&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2000|p=359}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Iran]], education for girls was started by a Bahá'ís leading to the eventual establishment in 1910 of the ''Tarbiyat School for Girls'' which helped train the first generation of Iranian professional women.&lt;ref name="Smith360"/&gt;  By the 1970s, while the majority of Iranian women were illiterate, most Bahá'í women could read and write.&lt;ref name="Smith360"/&gt;

Since the International Women's Year in 1975, the [[Universal House of Justice]], the governing body of the Bahá'ís, has repeatedly called national Bahá'í communities to promote the equal participation of women in Bahá'í activities.&lt;ref name="Smith360"/&gt; In 1993, the [[Bahá'í International Community]] established the ''Office of the Advancement of Women'' in [[New York City]] at the [[United Nations]], and various national communities have also created their own offices.&lt;ref name="Smith360"/&gt;  Activities in these programmes include the promotion of girls' education, literacy, rural health care, and income-generating skills.&lt;ref name="Smith360"/&gt;

The Bahá'í-inspired [[Tahirih Justice Center]] and the [[Barli Vocational Institute for Rural Women in Indore]] in India are projects that have received particular attention. [[Layli Miller-Muro]] founded the Tahirih Justice Center in 1997 following a well-publicized asylum case in which she was involved as a student attorney.&lt;ref name="case"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kassindja|1999|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller-Muro later co-wrote a book with the client she had aided and used her portion of the proceeds for the initial funding of Tahirih. {{as of|2003}}, the organization had assisted more than 4,000 women and children fleeing from a wide variety of abuses.&lt;ref name="y2003_ar"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://neuron.com/legal_tahirih_app/docs/AR_2003_Final.pdf  | author = Tahirih Justice Center | title= 3rd Annual Report | accessdate =2006-07-10 | year = 2003 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060104092848/http://neuron.com/legal_tahirih_app/docs/AR_2003_Final.pdf |archivedate = 2006-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Barli Vocational Institute for Rural Women was founded in 1985 in India and offers a six-month program for tribal women at its facilities in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh.&lt;ref name="bahaindia"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bahaindia.org/social/barlimore.html | title = Barli Development Institute for Rural Women | accessdate = 2006-09-15 | publisher = bahaindia.org | date = 2003-08-11 | author=bahaindia.org| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061013232726/http://www.bahaindia.org/social/barlimore.html| archivedate= 13 October 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through June 1996, a total of 769 rural tribal women have been trained at the Institute;&lt;ref name="bvirw"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.geocities.com/rainforest/2519/ | title = Barli Vocational Institute for Rural Women | author = Barli Vocational Institute for Rural Women | accessdate = 2006-09-15 | date = 2002-02-17|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060209010110/http://www.geocities.com/rainforest/2519/|archivedate=2006-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; the women came from 119 villages, and after returning home to their cities or villages 45% of them established small businesses, 62% are functionally literate or semi-literate (which has motivated people to send their children to school), 42% have started growing vegetables, 97% are using safe drinking water, all the former trainees and many of their male relatives have given up drinking alcohol, and caste prejudices have been eliminated.&lt;ref name="bvirw" /&gt;

==Distinction==
While the Bahá'í teachings assert the full spiritual and social equality of women to men, there are some aspects of gender distinctiveness or gender differentiation in certain areas of life.&lt;ref name="Smith143"/&gt; One of these aspects relate to the biological fact of potential motherhood for women, and thus the Bahá'í teaching that girls should be given priority in education as they potentially would be the children's first educator.&lt;ref name="Smith359"/&gt;  In the same sense, the Bahá'í view of family life gives the right to the mother to be supported by the husband if needed.  Similarly, the differences in the provisions of the ''[[Kitáb-i-Aqdas]]'', Bahá'u'lláh's book of laws, where in the case of [[intestacy]] it provides slightly more inheritance to men than women, can be seen in the same light.&lt;ref name="Smith359"/&gt;

While most of the teachings and laws of the Bahá'í Faith between a man and a woman apply ''[[mutatis mutandis]]'' as between a woman and a man, there are some Bahá'í teachings or laws that provide preference to women or men.  [[Menstruation|Menstruating]] women are exempt from practising the [[Obligatory Bahá'í prayers|obligatory prayer]] and from [[Nineteen Day Fast|fasting]] due to biological differences; these exemptions are not compulsory and do not reflect any concepts of ritual impurity.&lt;ref name="Smith359"/&gt;  Women also do not have the obligation of making [[Bahá'í pilgrimage|pilgrimage]], although they can if they choose; men who are financially able to do so are obliged to make the pilgrimage. In terms of Bahá'í administration, all positions except for membership on the [[Universal House of Justice]] are open to men and women.  No specific reason has been given for this exception, but `Abdu'l-Bahá has stated that there is a wisdom for it, which would eventually become clear.&lt;ref name="Smith359"/&gt;

`Abdu'l-Bahá implies that women will become equal in "sciences and arts, in virtues and perfections", and are actually superior in "tenderness of heart and the abundance of mercy and sympathy"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last = `Abdu'l-Bahá |author-link = `Abdu'l-Bahá |year = 1912 |publication-date = 1995 |title = Paris Talks |publisher = Bahá'í Distribution Service |isbn = 1-870989-57-0 |url = http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/PT/ }} [http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/PT/pt-60.html p. 184]&lt;/ref&gt; - virtues identified as gaining ascendancy as the world becomes more permeated with feminine ideals to balance the masculine ideals that now dominate.&lt;ref&gt;[[Moojan Momen]], [http://bahai-library.com/momen_women_dont_count In all the Ways that Matter, Women Don't Count]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Barja''' ({{lang-ar|برجا}}, also known as '''Barja al-Chouf''') is a town and municipality in the [[Chouf District]] of the [[Mount Lebanon Governorate]] in [[Lebanon]]. Barja is situated near the Mediterranean coast, 34 kilometers south of [[Beirut]] and at the midway point between the latter and [[Sidon]]. The town's total land area consists of 729 hectares and its highest point above sea level is documented at 310 meters.&lt;ref name="Localiban"&gt;{{cite web|title=Barja|url=http://www.localiban.org/article4194.html|website=Localiban|publisher=Localiban|accessdate=2016-03-30|date=2008-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barja had 12,888 registered voters in 2010, and eleven schools with a total of 2,788 students in 2006.&lt;ref name="Localiban"/&gt; Its inhabitants are predominantly [[Sunni Muslims]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Elections municipales et ikhtiariah au Mont-Liban |url=http://www.localiban.org/IMG/pdf/Elections_municipales_libanaises_2010_-_Mont-Liban.pdf |website=Localiban |publisher=Localiban |accessdate=2016-02-12 |page=19 |format=pdf |date=2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724081015/http://www.localiban.org/IMG/pdf/Elections_municipales_libanaises_2010_-_Mont-Liban.pdf |archivedate=2015-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Twentieth century===
The name Barja is originally derived from the ancient Greek word 'Taparchia', which means 'cultural center', and the Syriac word 'Burgas', which means 'a series of hills overlooking the sea'.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Built during the middle of the 20th century, Barja was renowned for its fertile soil, spring waters, limestone and gravel resources, as well as its strategic location along the coast of Lebanon. Early economic activities included fishing, farming, and light textile manufacturing.

During the [[Lebanese Civil War | Lebanese Civil War (1975-1990)]], hundreds of young men and women emigrated from Barja to various countries such as Australia, Brazil, the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, contributing to the [[Lebanese diaspora]]. With the strong support of scholarships from the [[Rafic Hariri]] Foundation, these Barja youth were able to pursue higher education and doctoral degrees from a variety of overseas universities.

===Contemporary period===
The town features antique houses originally built near fresh spring waters that demonstrate traditional architecture. The high street, Al-Ain Avenue, is located between three large hills and overlooks the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. It hosts a traditional Souk called 'Zak Zouk', several local restaurants, a popular barber called 'Mounib', and commercial shopping facilities.

Since the turn of the millennium, Barja has experienced rapid westernization. The introduction of telecommunication services such as the internet, mobile phones, and television has contributed to an overall development in the social and economic welfare of locals. The new generation have embraced modern lifestyles and experience new methods of entertainment such as going to cinemas, listening to western music and playing video games.

As public transportation and mass transit become more abundant, locals are commuting to the capital city [[Beirut]] in search for job opportunities. Most Barja residents who live in the capital city return to their hometowns during weekends. However, the rising costs of food and fuel remain a major barrier against the economic growth and development of Barja locals.

==Climate==
Barja enjoys mild Mediterranean climate during summer and winter seasons, as average temperatures vary between 11 - 27&amp;nbsp;°C. The town is home to pine groves, olive tree orchards, and a variety of outdoor recreational areas.

Much of the town was destroyed during a devastating earthquake that shook the Chouf District in 1956. However, over the past 50 years the remains of the earthquake have been gradually concealed beneath a layer of modern building development.

The '''Barwar''' are [[Hindu]] [[Caste system in India|caste]], found in the state of [[Uttar Pradesh]], India. The Barwar are a [[Denotified Tribes|denotified tribe]],  one of the tribal groupings that was deemed as criminal under the [[Criminal Tribes Act]].&lt;ref name="poi"&gt;People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII  Part One edited by A Hasan &amp; J C Das pages 204 to 211&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and origin==
The community is said to have originated in the [[Saran district]] of [[Bihar]]. They were expelled from Saran, by the local Raja, and settled in the [[Awadh]] region. The Raja of Bast, in Awadh then expelled them again, as they continued their marauding activities in his dominion. They have three subdivisions, the Sawang, Gulam and Tilam. The Sawang group considers itself to be of pure Barwar origin, while the other two groupings are descendents of individuals kidnapped by the Sawang.&lt;ref name="poi"/&gt;

==Present circumstances==
The Barwar historically were a community associated with marauding and plunder. The [[British Raj|British colonial authorities]] made various attempts to suppress their brigandage, With the departure of the British, the community was denotified. The Barwar now have [[scheduled caste]] status.&lt;ref name="poi"/&gt;

The [[2011 Census of India]] for Uttar Pradesh showed the Barwar population as 18,105.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/PCA/SC_ST/PCA-A10/SC-0900-PCA-A-10-ddw.xlsx |title= A-10 Individual Scheduled Caste Primary Census Abstract Data and its Appendix - Uttar Pradesh |publisher=Registrar General &amp; Census Commissioner, India |accessdate=2017-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Benjamin Feigenbaum''' (August 12, 1860 &amp;ndash; November 10, 1932) was a [[Poles|Polish]] born [[Yiddish]] [[socialist]], newspaper editor, translator, and satirist. Feigenbaum was an associate editor of the Yiddish language papers ''[[The Forward]]'', its predecessor ''[[Di Arbeter Tsaytung]],'' and the literary monthly ''[[Di Tsukunft]]''   and a pioneer of the [[Socialist Party of America]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/23373183/benjamin_feigenbaum_dies_leaving_4/|title=Feigenbaum Dies, Pioneer Socialist; Had been long ill|last=|first=|date=10 November 1932|work=The Brooklyn Daily Eagle|access-date=2018-09-02|page=12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/K2587506320/GPS?sid=wikipedia|title=Gale - User Identification Form|last=|first=|date=|website=link.galegroup.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Jewish Holiday of [[Yom Kippur]] in 1899, Feigenbaum famously said in alternative event ''"If there is a God and if he is Almighty as the clergy claims he is, I give him just two minutes’ time to kill me on the spot, so that he may prove his existence!"'' after two minutes he declared ''"See! There is no God!".'' Afterwards he announced a location for the workers to eat instead of fasting, as traditionally done during Yom Kippur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.versobooks.com/blogs/2981-london-s-revolutionary-yiddishland|title=London’s Revolutionary Yiddishland|work=Versobooks.com|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Benjamin Feigenbaum was born to a prominent [[Hasidic Judaism|Chassidic]] family in [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]]. He went to [[Yeshiva]]h, but became a free-thinker. According to a colleague, [[Israel Joshua Singer]], Feigenbaum's "conversion" to secularism happened when his teacher, the [[Ger (Hasidic dynasty)|Gerer]] rebbe, discovered that Feigenbaum was not wearing [[Tzitzit|tsitsit]], a ritual garb. The rebbe beat him as a punishment.&lt;ref name="HoweLibo2005"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KlxAWCZmy2QC|title=World of Our Fathers|author1=Irving Howe|author2=Kenneth Libo|date=October 2005|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=978-0-8147-3685-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Later on, he moved to Belgium; there he attended his first socialist protest in [[Antwerp]] in 1884.&lt;ref name="Weinstein2018"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bernard Weinstein|title=The Jewish Unions in America: Pages of History and Memories|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0ndKDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT46|date=6 February 2018|publisher=Open Book Publishers|isbn=978-1-78374-356-8|pages=46–}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 25, 1886, his wife Matilda (Kaminsky) Feigenbaum gave birth to their son [[William M. Feigenbaum|William Morris Feigenbaum]]. He a total of 2 daughters and 2 sons named Kanin, R. Ganetkin, William and Henry.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Career ==

As a young socialist in 1887, Feigenbaum considered starting a socialist Yiddish newspaper. To his delight, he discovered the London-based ''[[Arbeter Fraynd]]'' recently started. He wrote them immediately. Towards the end of 1888, Feigenbaum moved to [[London]], [[United Kingdom|UK]] with his wife, to join their editorial board.&lt;ref name="Weinstein2018" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mendelsohn1997"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bw8WCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA72|title=Essential Papers on Jews and the Left|author=Ezra Mendelsohn|date=June 1997|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=978-0-8147-5571-6|pages=72–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1891, Feigenbaum immigrated to [[New York City|New York]], to work on New York's first Yiddish-language socialist newspaper, ''Di Arbeter Tsaytung'' (The Workman's Paper). He co-founded the [[Workmen's Circle]], serving as its first General-Secretary.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In New York, Feigenbaum developed a relationship with [[Bolesław Miklaszewski]], a representative of the London affiliate of the [[Polish Socialist Party]] (PPS) called the Union of Polish Socialists Abroad (ZZSP). After vetting Feigenbaum's circles to ensure they did not have "a gravitational pull" to Russia, ZZSP announced creation of "Jewish Socialist Post from America to Poland" in 1896, to publish and disseminate Yiddish socialist literature.&lt;ref name="Zimmerman2004"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6sbr9cZyw_4C&amp;pg=PA127|title=Poles, Jews, and the Politics of Nationality: The Bund and the Polish Socialist Party in Late Tsarist Russia, 1892–1914|author=Joshua D. Zimmerman|date=26 January 2004|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|isbn=978-0-299-19463-5|pages=127–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Police retaliation ==
Feigenbaum was arrested during a brawl with the police on October 29, 1892 , shortly after giving a speech in [[Philadelphia]]. He was charged with inciting to riot, assaulting an officer and breaching the peace after allegedly hitting an officer with his cane. He was held on $600 bail.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/23307268/pittsburgh_dispatch/|title=Clipping from Pittsburgh Dispatch - Newspapers.com|last=|first=|date=October 30, 1892|work=Pittsburgh Dispatch|access-date=2018-08-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]] he was charged with inciting to riot, which were later dismissed by a Judge during trial in a higher court.&lt;ref name="Weinstein20182"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0ndKDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT53|title=The Jewish Unions in America: Pages of History and Memories|author=Weinstein|first=Bernard|date=6 February 2018|publisher=Open Book Publishers|year=|isbn=978-1-78374-356-8|location=|pages=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January, 1905, Providence police received a tip that an "anarchist provocateur" was scheduled to speak. Police surrounded the designated venue, disabling gas and cited lack of permit for as reason for shutting it down. The sponsors of the lecture, the Providence branch of [[Workmen's Circle]] obtained permits and scheduled another venue for Feigenbaum to speak at. If Hyman Goldsmith, a Yiddish speaking undercover police patrolman heard Feigenbaum mention anything about “[[Emma Goldman]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;ism” or “bomb throwing” the hall would be cleared immediately by other undercover police in crowd. Instead, Feigenbaum orated for two hours and 15 minutes about the compatibility of religion and socialism, in contrast with his earlier recitals. The police were ridiculed the following day by ''[[Daily Journal (Providence)|The Daily Journal]]'', ''[[The Evening Bulletin]]'', and ''[[The Providence Telegram]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jvhri.org/stories/When-the-Socialist-came-to-town,1525?|title=When ‘the Socialist’ came to town|last=Foster|first=Geraldine S.|date=November 13, 2015|work=The Jewish Voice|access-date=2018-09-01|publisher=Jewish Alliance of Greater Rhode Island|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ingall|first=Carol K.|date=November 1979|title=The Day The Anarchists Came to Town|url=http://www.rijha.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/8-1-Nov-79.pdf|journal=Rhode Island Jewish Historical Notes|volume=8|issue=1|pages=95-97|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Criticism of zionism and religion ==
''&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;''
Feigenbaum was highly critical of [[Zionism]] and the usage of biblical scriptures to promoting ''socialist spiritualization''. In his Yiddish article, ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'Materialism in Judaism or Religion and Life'&lt;nowiki/&gt;'' (1896), Feigenbaum criticized using the [[Bible]] as 'propaganda'. If [[Jeremiah]] did not know [[Karl Marx|Marx]], then it was disingenuous to claim that Marxism is part of a prophetic tradition. In ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'Vi Kumt a yid tsu sotsyialismus'''  (How does a Jew come to socialism?) Feigenbaum writes ''"Yes, brothers, socialism is redemption for us, the Jews. Socialism will rescue all the unfortunate people, Jews as well, and give them equal rights...Socialism's victory would spell the only effective defeat of the forces of anti-Semitism".'' He further maintains that he met socialist [[Gentile]]s who ridded themselves of anti-Semitism upon discovering socialism. The enemy is the capitalist, whether Gentile or Jewish; and the Jewish poor are his friend.&lt;ref name="Stern2018"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y5BNDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA24|title=Jewish Materialism: The Intellectual Revolution of the 1870s|author=Eliyahu Stern|date=20 March 2018|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-22180-0|pages=24–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feigenbaum rejected Zionism as utopian and urged Jews to reject notion of ''[[Jewish diaspora|Goles]]'' as exile from [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], but rather state of persecution, from which socialism can redeem them.&lt;ref name="Zimmerman2004" /&gt;

==Death==
Feigenbaum died on the morning of November 10, 1932 in the [[St Barnabas Hospital (Bronx)|Home for Incurables]] in New York. He had been ill for the previous ten years, the last three of which he was paralyzed. Funeral services were held in Forward Hall, on November 13, 1932. Feigenbaum is currently buried in the [[Workmen's Circle|Workmen’s Circle]] section of [[Mount Carmel Cemetery (Queens, New York)|Mount Carmel Cemetery]], in [[Queens]], [[New York City|New York]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jta.org/1932/11/11/archive/funeral-services-sunday-for-feigenbaum-socialist-leader|title=Funeral Services Sunday for Feigenbaum, Socialist Leader {{!}} Jewish Telegraphic Agency|website=www.jta.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Christian culture}}
'''Christian art''' is [[sacred art]] which uses themes and imagery from [[Christianity]]. Most Christian groups use or have used art to some extent, although some have had [[Aniconism in Christianity|strong objections to some forms of religious image]], and there have been major periods of [[iconoclasm]] within Christianity.

Images of [[Jesus]] and narrative scenes from the [[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]] are the most common subjects, and scenes from the [[Old Testament]] play a part in the art of most denominations.  Images of the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] and saints are much rarer in Protestant art than that of [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] and [[Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]].

Christianity makes far wider use of images than related religions, in which figurative representations are forbidden, such as [[Aniconism in Islam|Islam]] and [[Aniconism in Judaism|Judaism]].  However, there is also a considerable history of [[aniconism in Christianity]] from various periods.

== History ==

===Beginnings===
{{main|Early Christian art and architecture}}
[[File:VirgenNino.jpg|thumb|250px|Virgin and Child. Wall painting from the early [[catacombs]], Rome, 4th century.]]
[[Early Christian art]] survives from dates near the origins of Christianity. The oldest Christian sculptures are from [[sarcophagi]], dating to the beginning of the 2nd century.  The largest groups of Early Christian paintings come from the tombs in the [[Catacombs of Rome]], and show the evolution of the [[depiction of Jesus]], a process not complete until the 6th century, since when the conventional appearance of Jesus in art has remained remarkably consistent.

Until the [[Constantine I and Christianity|adoption of Christianity by Constantine]] Christian art derived its style and much of its [[iconography]] from popular [[Roman art]], but from this point grand Christian buildings built under imperial patronage brought a need for Christian versions of Roman elite and official art, of which [[mosaic]]s in churches in Rome are the most prominent surviving examples.  Christian art was caught up in, but did not originate, the shift in style  from the  classical tradition inherited from [[Ancient Greek art]] to a less realist and otherworldly hieratic style, the start of [[gothic art]].

===Middle Ages===
{{main|Medieval art}}
[[File:Christ Pantocrator Deesis mosaic Hagia Sophia.jpg|thumb|upright|12th-century Byzantine mosaics of the [[Hagia Sophia]] showing the image of [[Christ Pantocrator]].]]
Much of the art surviving from [[Europe]] after the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]] is Christian art, although this in large part because the continuity of church ownership has preserved church art better than secular works.  While the [[Western Roman Empire]]'s political structure essentially collapsed after the fall of [[Rome]], its religious hierarchy, what is today the modern-day [[Roman Catholic Church]] commissioned  and funded production of religious art imagery.

The [[Orthodox Church of Constantinople]], which enjoyed greater stability within the surviving [[Eastern Empire]] was key in commissioning  imagery there and glorifying Christianity. As a stable Western European society emerged during the [[Middle Ages]], the Catholic Church led the way in terms of art, using its resources to commission [[painting]]s and [[sculpture]]s.

During the development of Christian art in the [[Byzantine Empire]] (see [[Byzantine art]]), a more abstract aesthetic replaced the naturalism previously established in [[Hellenistic Greece|Hellenistic]] art. This new style was hieratic, meaning its primary purpose was to convey religious meaning rather than accurately render objects and people.  Realistic perspective, proportions, light and color were ignored in favor of geometric simplification of forms, reverse perspective and standardized conventions to portray individuals and events.  The controversy over the use of ''graven images'', the interpretation of the Second Commandment, and the crisis of [[Byzantine Iconoclasm]] led to a standardization of religious imagery within the [[Eastern Orthodoxy]].

===Renaissance and Early Modern period===
[[File:Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519) - The Last Supper (1495-1498).jpg|thumb|280px|[[The Last Supper (Leonardo da Vinci)|Leonardo da Vinci's ''The Last Supper'']] (1498).]]
The [[fall of Constantinople]] in 1453 brought an end to the highest quality Byzantine art, produced in the Imperial workshops there. Orthodox art, known as [[icon]]s regardless of the medium, has otherwise continued with relatively little change in subject and style up to the present day, with Russia gradually becoming the leading centre of production.

In the West, the Renaissance saw an increase in monumental secular works, but until the [[Protestant Reformation]] Christian art continued to be commissioned  in great quantities by churches, clergy and by the aristocracy.  The Reformation had a [[The Reformation and art|huge effect on Christian art]], rapidly bringing the production of public Christian art to a virtual halt in Protestant countries, and causing the destruction of most of the art that already existed.

Artists were commissioned more secular genres like [[portrait]]s, [[landscape painting]]s and because of  the revival of Neoplatonism,  subjects from [[classical mythology]].  In Catholic countries, production continued, and increased during the [[Counter-Reformation]], but Catholic art was brought under much tighter control by the church hierarchy than had been the case before.  From the 18th century the number of religious works produced by leading artists declined sharply, though important commissions were still placed, and some artists continued to produce large bodies of religious art on their own initiative.

===Modern period===
As a secular, non-sectarian, universal notion of art arose in 19th-century Western Europe, ancient and Medieval Christian art began to be collected for art appreciation rather than worship, while contemporary Christian art was considered marginal.  Occasionally, secular artists treated Christian themes ([[Bouguereau]], [[Manet]]) — but only rarely was a Christian artist included in the historical canon (such as [[Georges Rouault|Rouault]] or [[Stanley Spencer]]).  However many modern artists such as [[Eric Gill]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Jacob Epstein]], [[Elizabeth Frink]] and [[Graham Sutherland]] have produced well-known works of art for churches.&lt;ref&gt;Beth Williamson, ''Christian Art: A Very Short Introduction'', [[Oxford University Press]] (2004), page 110.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Salvador Dali]] is an artist who had also produced notable and popular artworks with Christian themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/dali/salvador/resources/DaliandReligion.pdf |title=Dali and Religion |work=National Gallery of Victoria, Australia }}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary artists such as [[Makoto Fujimura]] have had significant influence both in sacred and secular arts. Other notable artists include [[Larry D. Alexander]] and [[John August Swanson]]. Some writers, such as Gregory Wolfe, see this as part of a rebirth of Christian humanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolfe|first=Gregory|title=Beauty Will Save the World: Recovering the Human in an Ideological Age|year=2011|publisher=Intercollegiate Studies Institute|isbn=978-1-933859-88-0|pages=278|url=https://www.amazon.com/Beauty-Will-Save-World-Ideological/dp/1933859881}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popular devotional art===
Since the advent of printing, the sale of reproductions of pious works has been a major element of popular [[Christian culture]]. In the 19th century, this included genre painters such as [[Mihály Munkácsy]]. The invention of color lithography led to broad circulation of [[holy card]]s. In the modern era, companies specializing in modern commercial Christian artists such as [[Thomas Blackshear]] and [[Thomas Kinkade]], although widely regarded in the fine art world as [[kitsch]],&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia A. Freeland, ''But Is It Art?: An Introduction to Art Theory'', Oxford University Press (2001), page 95&lt;/ref&gt; have been very successful.

The '''Eyüp Cemetery''' ({{lang-tr|Eyüp Mezarlığı}}), aka '''Eyüp Sultan Cemetery''', is a historic burial ground located in the [[Eyüp]] district, on the European side of [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]]. It is administered by the [[General Directorate of Foundations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medeniyetimiz.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=281:eyuep-sultan-te-ihmal-edilen-mezarlk-&amp;catid=44:genel&amp;Itemid=62 |publisher=Medeniyetimiz |title=Eyüp Sultan: İşte ihmal edilen mezarlık |date=2010-11-24 |accessdate=2013-10-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the oldest and largest [[Muslim]] cemeteries in Istanbul, it hosts graves of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] sultans and court members, [[grand vizier]]s, high-ranked [[Shaykh al-Islām|religious authorities]], civil servants and military commanders as well as intellectuals, scientists, artists and poets.

==History==
[[File:DSC04799 Istanbul - Cimitero di Eyüp - Foto G. Dall'Orto 30-5-2006.jpg|thumb|275px|Historic headstones in the Eyüp Cemetery from Ottoman era with different head coverings denoting the burial's profession or social status.]]
The cemetery was very popular with Ottoman people, as they wanted to be buried next to the tomb of [[Abu Ayyub al-Ansari]] (576–circa 672 or 674), in [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] ''Ebu Eyyûb el-Ensarî'' (in [[modern Turkish]] ''Eyüp Sultan'', hence the name of the cemetery). A close companion (''[[sahaba]]'') of [[Muhammad|Prophet Muhammad]], he died [[First Arab Siege of Constantinople|during a raid]] against the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] capital [[Constantinople]] and wanted to be buried as close as possible to the city walls. After the [[Conquest of Constantinople]] by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] in 1453, a [[türbe|tomb]] was constructed above his grave and a [[mosque]], called today the [[Eyüp Sultan Mosque]], was built in his honor. From that time on, the area now known as [[Eyüp]] has become sacred, and many prominent [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] people requested burial in proximity of Abu Ayyub.

The Eyüp Cemetery is situated on the western bank of the [[Golden Horn]] just outside the historic [[Walls of Constantinople]] (today İstanbul). It stretches between the Golden Horn's shore up to Karyağdı Slope, and further to [[Edirnekapı, Istanbul|Edirnekapı]]. Road construction works and [[nationalization]] around Golden Horn did great damage to the graves.

Among the most interesting graves are of those of the Ottoman-era public executioners. They were not allowed to be buried in public cemeteries, and a separate burial ground, called the "Executioner Cemetery" ({{lang-tr|Cellat Mezarkığı}}), existed on the Karyağdı Hill aside the Eyüp Cemetery. Their burial took place only in two cemeteries in Istanbul, and this secretly in the night. The headstones were blank without any name and date in order to avoid retaliation by the relatives of the executed persons. Unfortunately, only a few executioner graves have survived up to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.radikal.com.tr/turkiye/cellat_mezarliklari_kayiplara_karisti-1059591 |newspaper=[[Radikal]] |title=Cellat mezarlıkları kayıplara karıştı |author=Erbil, Ömer |date=2011-08-11 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2013-10-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haberturk.com/yasam/haber/667994-cellat-mezarligi-yok-oluyor-galeri |newspaper=[[Habertürk]] |title=Cellat mezarlığı yok oluyor! |date=2011-11-09 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2013-10-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="a"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aksiyon.com.tr/aksiyon/haber-32975-173-istanbula-hurmet-eyupten-baslar.html |publisher=Aksiyon |title=İstanbul’a hürmet Eyüp’ten başlar |language=Turkish |accessdate=2013-10-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crime site==
In the evening hours of a November day in 1994, a 45-year-old [[Austria]]n woman professor was assaulted, murdered and robbed as she was descending the hill through the cemetery after a coffee break at the popular cafeteria (called [[Pierre Loti]] cafeteria) on the top of the hill. The murderer was a 17 years old car painter.&lt;ref name="h1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://arama.hurriyet.com.tr/arsivnews.aspx?id=13305 |newspaper=[[Hürriyet]] |title=Tanıklar susuyor |authors=Ordu, Şenay &amp; Taner Yener |date=2001-09-01 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2013-10-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early hours of afternoon on August 25, 2001, prominent [[Jews in Turkey|Turkish Jewish]] businessman and a cofounder of [[Alarko Holding]], [[Üzeyir Garih]] was found dead by cemetery guards next to the grave of [[Fevzi Çakmak]]. He was stabbed ten times, of which seven were deadly. Police arrested a suspect after two hours, who confessed the crime adding he committed the murder for robbery.&lt;ref name="h"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://hurarsiv.hurriyet.com.tr/goster/printnews.aspx?DocID=12166 |newspaper=[[Hürriyet]] |title=Üzeyir Garih öldürüldü |date=2001-08-25 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2013-10-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the actual murderer, who robbed Garih's money and stole his mobile phone, was caught ten days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://arsiv.sabah.com.tr/2001/09/05/g01.html |newspaper=[[Sabah (newspaper)|Sabah]] |title=Eyüp canavarı kıskıvrak  |date=2001-09-05 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2013-10-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, Garih used to visit the grave of Turkey's first [[General Staff of the Republic of Turkey|Chief of the General Staff]] [[field marshal]] Çakmak every two weeks.&lt;ref name="h"/&gt;

Shortly after the 2001 murder case, a commissioner at the [[prosecutor's office]] of Eyüp district admitted that the Eyüp Cemetery had become a place of prostitution and drug use by negligence.&lt;ref name="h1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://webarsiv.hurriyet.com.tr/2001/08/30/22294.asp |newspaper=[[Hürriyet]] |title=Eyüp Mezarlığı fuhuş yeri |date=2001-08-20 |language=Turkish |accessdate=201-10-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported that since the murder in 1994 no monitoring by police patrol was taking place in the cemetery and at the trail to the cafeteria on the top of the hill, which are frequented by tourists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://arama.hurriyet.com.tr/arsivnews.aspx?id=12354 |newspaper=[[Hürriyet]] |title=Suçlayacak delil bulunamadı |authors=Atilla Toygun &amp; Ali Aksoyer, Asım Güneş, Taner Yener |date=2001-08-27 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2013-10-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6108">There is relatively little history of active practice of '''Hinduism in Portugal'''. Presently there is a [[Hinduism|Hindu]] community of approximately 9,000 persons, which largely traces its origins to [[India]]ns who emigrated from the former [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Portuguese Empire|colonies]] of [[Lusophone]] [[Africa]], particularly from [[Mozambique]], and from the former colony of [[Goa]] and other possessions in [[Portuguese India]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71401.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;.

From the mid 1990s on there was an influx of Hindus of Nepalese origin in Portugal as a result of labour migration originated from that South Asian country. Also since the 1990s it is possible to find in Lisbon a small Hare Krishna community, consisting mainly of Caucasians of Portuguese origin, but also Brazilian and devotes from other European countries.

Hindus in Portugal are, according to the Indian Embassy in Lisbon, mainly [[Gujarati people|Gujaratis]] ([[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] is taught at the Hindu Community Cultural Centre, in Lisbon),  [[Punjabi people|Punjabis]] and [[Goans]]. The majority of the Hindus live in the capital city, [[Lisbon]], but it is also possible to find some Hindu-Gujarati families living in Oporto.{{ref}}

==Hindu groups in Portugal==

[[Gujaratis]] moved to Mozambique under colonial rule, and after the independence of that country in 1974, some of them moved to Portugal (particularly to Lisbon). Since the 1980s, Gujaratis have migrated to Portugal directly from their homeland in Gujarat and the island of Diu.

[[Goa]]ns first emigrated to Portugal in 1961, following the action of the Indian armed forces and subsequent annexation of Goa, Damão &amp; Diu to India. They also built up a community in Mozambique before its independence, and then moved to Portugal. A liberal immigration policy and citizenship given to families of former Portuguese subjects in Goa has allowed their numbers to rise in Portugal.

[[Daman and Diu|Daman]], [[Diu, India|Diu]], [[Dadra and Nagar Haveli|Dadra]] and Nagar Haveli Hindus have been present in Portugal since slightly before the annexation of those territories in 1954 and 1961. [[Punjabis]], who were subjects of British rather than Portuguese colonialism, have recently begun emigration to Portugal.

==Hindu organisation in Portugal==
- The "Hindu Community of Portugal" ({{lang-pt|Comunidade Hindu de Portugal}}), a Hindu organisation, was founded in 1982 [http://www.hinduismtoday.com/archives/1997/2/1997-2-15.shtml]. There is also a [[Hindu temple]], called ''Templo Hindu [[Radha Krishna]]'', which belongs to Comunidade Hindu de Portugal, and is located at the [[Mahatma Gandhi]] alameda in Lisbon.

- Shiv Mandir Association. ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: Templo de Shiva - Associação de Solidariedade Social).

- BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir, Lisbon ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: Missão Swaminarayan Hindu).

'''Ibogaine''' is a naturally occurring [[Psychoactive drug|psychoactive]] substance found in plants in the [[Apocynaceae]] family such as ''[[Tabernanthe iboga]]'', ''[[Voacanga africana]]'' and ''[[Tabernaemontana undulata]]''.&lt;ref name="Koe2015"/&gt; It is a [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] with [[dissociative]] properties.

&lt;!-- Uses --&gt;
Preliminary research indicates that it may help with [[drug addiction]];&lt;ref name=Koe2015/&gt; however, there is a lack of data in humans.&lt;ref name=Brown2013/&gt; Its use has been associated with serious side effects and death. Between the years 1990 and 2008 a total of 19 fatalities temporally associated with the ingestion of ibogaine were reported, from which six subjects died of acute heart failure or cardiopulmonary arrest.

The psychoactivity of the root barks of the iboga tree (''Tabernanthe iboga''), from which ibogaine is extracted, was first discovered by the [[Pygmy]] tribe of Central Africa who passed the knowledge to the [[Bwiti]] tribe of [[Gabon]].  French explorers in turn learned of it from the Bwiti tribe and brought iboga back to Europe in 1899-1900 where it was subsequently marketed in France as Lambarene.  Ibogaine-containing preparations are used for medicinal and ritual purposes within African spiritual traditions of the Bwiti, who claim to have learned it from the [[Pygmy peoples]]. Although it was first commonly advertised as having [[anti-addictive]] properties in 1962 by [[Howard Lotsof]], its Western use predates that by at least a century. In France it was marketed as ''Lambarène'' and used as a stimulant. Also, the U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) studied the effects of ibogaine in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alper|first1=Kenneth R.|editor1-last=Alper |editor1-first=Kenneth R.|editor2-last=Glick|editor2-first=Stanley D.|title=Ibogaine : proceedings from the first international conference |date=2001|publisher=Academic|isbn=9780120532063|pages=2–33|chapter=Chapter 1: Ibogaine: A Review|series=The Alkaloids|volume=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Psychoactive effects ==

Ibogaine is derived from the root of the ''Tabernanthe iboga'', a plant known to exhibit [[Psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] effects in its users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A CONTEMPORARY HISTORY OF IBOGAINE IN THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE|author1=Alper, Kenneth R. |author2=Beal, Dana |author3=Kaplan, Charles D. |page=256|url=http://www.ibogaine.desk.nl/ch14.pdf |year=2001 |publisher=Academic Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experience of ibogaine occurs in two phases, the visionary phase and the introspection phase. The visionary phase has been described as [[oneirogen]]ic, referring to the dreamlike nature of its [[Psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] effects, and lasts for 4 to 6 hours. The second phase, the introspection phase, is responsible for the psychotherapeutic effects. It can allow people to conquer their fears and negative emotions. Ibogaine catalyzes an [[altered state of consciousness]] reminiscent of dreaming while fully conscious and aware so that memories, life experiences, and issues of trauma can be processed.&lt;ref name="clinicalmanagement"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Practical Skills and Clinical Management of Alcoholism &amp; Drug Addiction |author=Obembe, Samuel |page=88 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/book/9780123985187 |accessdate=6 September 2012 |isbn=9780123985187 |year=2012 |publisher=Elsevier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Adverse effects ==

===Immediate===
One of the first noticeable effects of large-dose ibogaine ingestion is [[ataxia]], a difficulty in coordinating muscle motion which makes standing and walking difficult without assistance. [[Xerostomia]] (dry mouth), [[nausea]], and vomiting may follow. These symptoms may be long in duration, ranging from 4 to 24 hours in some cases. Ibogaine is sometimes administered [[enema|per rectum]] to avoid nausea and vomiting.

===Cardiovascular===
Ibogaine causes [[long QT syndrome]] at therapeutic doses, apparently by blocking [[hERG]] potassium channels in the heart.&lt;ref name=Koe2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alper|first=Kenneth|last2=Bai|first2=Rong|last3=Liu|first3=Nian|last4=Fowler|first4=Steven J.|last5=Huang|first5=Xi-Ping|last6=Priori|first6=Silvia G.|last7=Ruan|first7=Yanfei|date=1 January 2016|title=hERG Blockade by Iboga Alkaloids|journal=Cardiovascular Toxicology|language=en|volume=16|issue=1|pages=14–22|doi=10.1007/s12012-015-9311-5|pmid=25636206|issn=1530-7905}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interactions==

Adverse interactions may occur between ibogaine and psychiatric medications. Some studies also suggest the possibility of adverse interaction with heart conditions.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Koe2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Because ibogaine is one of the many drugs that are partly metabolized by the [[cytochrome P450]] complex, caution must be exercised to avoid [[List of drugs affected by grapefruit|foods or drugs]] that are similarly metabolized by CP450, in particular foods containing [[bergamottin]] or [[bergamot essential oil|bergamot oil]], such as grapefruit juice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/food-and-nutrition/AN00413|title=Grapefruit juice: Beware of dangerous medication interactions|accessdate=10 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is converted using N-iodosuccinamide and then [[fluoride]] to form 2-(2-iodo-1H-indol-3-yl)ethanol. This is treated with [[iodine]], [[triphenyl phosphine]] and [[imidazole]] to form 2-iodo-3-(2-iodoethyl)-1H-indole. Then using 7-ethyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-5-ene and [[cesium]] [[carbonate]] in [[acetonitrile]] the ibogaine precursor 7-ethyl-2-(2-(2-iodo-1H-indol-3-yl)ethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-5-ene is obtained. Using palladium acetate in DMF the ibogaine is obtained. If the exo ethyl group on the 2-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane system in ibogaine is replaced with an endo ethyl then [[epiibogaine]] is formed.

== Natural occurrence ==

Ibogaine occurs naturally in iboga root bark. Ibogaine is also available in a total alkaloid extract of the ''Tabernanthe iboga'' plant, which also contains all the other iboga alkaloids and thus has only about half the potency by weight as standardized ibogaine hydrochloride.&lt;ref name="pmid11942686"/&gt;

== History ==

The use of iboga in African spiritual ceremonies was first reported by French and Belgian explorers in the 19th century. The first botanical description of the ''Tabernanthe iboga'' plant was made in 1889. Ibogaine was first isolated from ''T. [[iboga]]'' in 1901 by Dybowski and Landrin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dybowski, J.  |author2=Landrin, E.  |year=1901 |title=PLANT CHEMISTRY.

Sci. |volume=133 |page=748|url=http://www.ibogaine.desk.nl/dybowski.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and independently by Haller and Heckel in the same year using ''T. iboga'' samples from [[Gabon]]. Complete synthesis of ibogaine was accomplished by G. Büchi in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Büchi, G. |author2=Coffen, D.L. |author3=Kocsis, Karoly |author4=Sonnet, P.E. |author5=Ziegler, Frederick E. |year=1966 |title=The Total Synthesis of Iboga Alkaloids |journal=J.

From the 1930s to 1960s, ibogaine was sold in France in the form of Lambarène, an extract of the ''Tabernanthe manii'' plant, and promoted as a mental and physical stimulant. The drug enjoyed some popularity among post World War II athletes.  Lambarène was withdrawn from the market in 1966 when the sale of ibogaine-containing products became illegal in France.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/ibogaine/ibogaine_article3.shtml Ibogaine: A Novel Anti-Addictive Compound – A Comprehensive Literature Review] Jonathan Freedlander, University of Maryland Baltimore County, Journal of Drug Education and Awareness, 2003; 1:79–98.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1960s the [[World Health Assembly]] classified ibogaine as a “substance likely to cause dependency or endanger human health,” the [[Food and Drug Administration|U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)]] assigned it [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedule I controlled substances|Schedule I classification]], and the [[International Olympic Committee]] banned it as a potential doping agent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iceers.org/docs/science/iboga/ICEERS2012_Ibogaine_literature_compilation.pdf Ibogaine – Scientific Literature Overview] The International Center for Ethnobotanical Education, Research &amp; Service (ICEERS) 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

He contracted with a Belgian company to produce ibogaine in tablet form for clinical trials in the Netherlands, and was awarded a United States patent for the product in 1985.  The first objective, placebo-controlled evidence of Ibogaine's ability to attenuate opioid withdrawal in rats was published by Dzoljic ''et al.'' in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dzoljic ED, Kaplan CD, Dzoljic MR |title=Effect of ibogaine on naloxone-precipitated withdrawal syndrome in chronic morphine-dependent rats |journal=Arch Int Pharmacodyn Ther |volume=294 |pages=64–70 |year=1988 |pmid=3233054 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Diminution of [[morphine]] self-administration was reported in preclinical studies by Glick ''et al.'' in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Glick SD, Rossman K, Steindorf S, Maisonneuve IM, Carlson JN |year=1991 |title=Effects and aftereffects of ibogaine on morphine self-administration in rats |journal=Eur.

As the use of ibogaine spread, its administration varied widely; some groups administered it systematically using well developed methods and medical personnel, while others employed haphazard and possibly dangerous methodology.  Lotsof and his colleagues, committed to the traditional administration of ibogaine, developed treatment regimens themselves. In 1992, Eric Taub brought ibogaine to an offshore location close to the United States, where he began providing treatments and popularizing its use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A Home for Ibogaine in Barcelona|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mary-clare-ditton/a-home-for-ibogaine-in-ba_b_56563.html|website = The Huffington Post|accessdate = 11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Costa Rica]] Lex Kogan, another leading proponent, joined Taub in systematizing its administration.

In 1981 an unnamed European manufacturer produced 44&amp;nbsp;kg of iboga extract. The entire stock was purchased by Carl Waltenburg, who distributed it under the name "Indra extract" and used it in 1982 to treat heroin addicts in [[Freetown Christiania|Christiania]], Denmark, a [[squatter]] village where heroin addiction was widespread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.ibogaine.org/history.html |chapter=A Contemporary History of Ibogaine in the United States and Europe|accessdate=15 August 2012|journal=The Alkaloids|title=Ibogaine: Proceedings of the First International Conference|volume=56|author1=Alper, Kenneth R. |author2=Beal, Dana |author3=Kaplan, Charles D. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indra extract was available for sale over the Internet until 2006, when the Indra web presence disappeared.

==Research==

=== Addiction treatment ===
The most-studied therapeutic effect of ibogaine is the reduction or elimination of [[Substance dependence|addiction]] to [[opioid]]s. An integral effect is the alleviation of symptoms of opioid [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]]. Research also suggests that ibogaine may be useful in treating dependence on other substances such as [[alcohol]], [[methamphetamine]], and [[nicotine]] and may affect compulsive behavioral patterns not involving substance abuse or chemical dependence. Researchers note that there remains a "need for systematic investigation in a conventional clinical research setting."&lt;ref name=Alper/&gt;

Many users of ibogaine report experiencing visual phenomena during a waking dream state, such as instructive replays of life events that led to their addiction, while others report therapeutic [[shaman]]ic visions that help them conquer the fears and negative emotions that might drive their addiction. It is proposed that intensive counseling, therapy and aftercare during the interruption period following treatment is of significant value. Some individuals require a second or third treatment session with ibogaine over the course of the next 12 to 18 months. A minority of individuals relapse completely into opiate addiction within days or weeks. A comprehensive article (Lotsof 1995) on the subject of ibogaine therapy detailing the procedure, effects and aftereffects is found in "Ibogaine in the Treatment of Chemical Dependence Disorders: Clinical Perspectives".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=H.S.|last1=Lotsof|year=1995|url=http://ibogaine.desk.nl/clin-perspectives.html|title=Ibogaine in the Treatment of Chemical Dependence Disorders: Clinical Perspectives|publisher=MAPS Bulletin|volume=3|pages=19–26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970122031859/http://www.ibogaine.desk.nl/clin-perspectives.html|archivedate=22 January 1997|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ibogaine has also been reported in multiple small-study cohorts to reduce cravings for methamphetamine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Giannini, A. James |title=Drugs of Abuse |publisher=Practice Management Information Corporation |year=1997 |isbn=978-1-57066-053-5 |edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also evidence that this type of treatment works with [[LSD]], which has been shown to have a therapeutic effect on alcoholism. Both ibogaine and LSD appear to be effective for encouraging introspection and giving the user occasion to reflect on the sources of their addiction, while also producing an intense, transformative experience that can put established patterns of behaviour into perspective;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Chronic pain management ===
In 1957, Jurg Schneider, a pharmacologist at CIBA (now a division of [[Novartis]]), found that ibogaine potentiated [[morphine]] [[analgesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|invent1=Jurg Schneider|country=US|number=2817623|title=Tabernanthine, Ibogaine Containing Analgesic Compositions.|url=http://ibogaine.desk.nl/2817623.pdf|gdate=1957-12-24|assign1=CIBA Pharmaceuticals Inc.|fdate=1956-03-22|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; No additional data was ever published by CIBA researchers on ibogaine–opioid interactions. Almost 50 years later, [[Patrick Kroupa]] and [[Hattie Wells]] released the first treatment protocol for concomitant administration of ibogaine with [[opioids]] in human subjects, indicating that ibogaine reduced tolerance to opioid drugs. Their paper in the ''[[Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies]] Journal'' demonstrated that administration of low "maintenance" doses of ibogaine HCl with [[opioids]] decreases [[Drug tolerance|tolerance]], but noted that ibogaine's [[Potentiation|potentiating]] action could make this a risky procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Kroupa, Patrick K.  |author2=Wells, Hattie |year=2005|season=Spring|url=http://ibogaine.mindvox.com/Articles/MAPS-Ibogaine2.pdf|title=Ibogaine in the 21st Century|publisher=Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies|volume=XV|pages=21–25|format=PDF|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychotherapy ===
Ibogaine has been used as an adjunct to [[psychotherapy]] by [[Claudio Naranjo]], documented in his book ''The Healing Journey''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Naranjo, Claudio |title=The healing journey: new approaches to consciousness |publisher=Pantheon Books |location=New York |year=1973 |isbn=978-0-394-48826-4 |chapter-url=http://www.ibogaine.desk.nl/naranjo.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010717084858/http://www.ibogaine.desk.nl/naranjo.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=17 July 2001 |chapter=V, Ibogaine: Fantasy and Reality |pages=197–231 |accessdate=15 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded patent {{patent|CA|939266}} in 1974.

'''Kalaureia''' ({{lang-grc|Καλαυρεία}}) or '''Calauria''' or '''Kalavria''' ({{lang-ell|Καλαυρία}}) is an island close to the coast of [[Troezen]] in the [[Peloponnesus]] of mainland [[Greece]], part of the modern island-pair [[Poros]].

[[Strabo]] describes the coastwise journey along the [[Ermioni|Hermionic Gulf]]:
:"''The gulf begins at the town of [[Asine (Argolis)|Asine]]. Then come [[Ermioni|Hermione]] and Troezen; and, as one sails along the coast, one comes also to the island of Calauria, which has a circuit of one hundred and thirty stadia and is separated from the mainland by a strait four [[stadion (unit)|stadia]] wide.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Strabo|viii.6.3}} ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Strab.+8.6.23 On-line text]).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-classical asylum==
[[File:Temple of Poseidon Poros.jpg|thumbnail|left|The site of the temple of Poseidon.]]On Calauria a [[Doric order|Doric temple]] of [[Poseidon]] was built in the ancient sanctuary, possibly around 520 BCE. The dimensions of the temple are 27.4 by 14.4 m. There are six columns on each short side and twelve on each long side.

There is strong evidence that the [[epithet]] of Poseidon at Kalaureia was ''Geraistos'' (Γεραιστός), a word from an unknown [[Pre-Greek|pre-Hellenic language]].&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, Rob W.M. “Three Related Sanctuaries of Poseidon.” Greek Sanctuaries: New Approaches. Eds. Marinatos, Nanno and Hägg, Robert, Routledge: New York, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; A 6th century A.D. dictionary by [[Stephanus of Byzantium]] gives the names of Zeus's sons as Geraistos, [[Taenarus (mythology)|Tainaros]], and Kalauros, who sailed from an unspecified location and landed in different places on the Peloponnesus.&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher 1993, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; Geraistos, Tainaros, and Kalaureia are all sanctuaries of Poseidon; in the towns of the latter two, one of the months of the year was named Geraistios (the only other ''poleis'' (πόλεις) with this month name are Sparta, [[Kalymna]], and [[Kos]]). It is also theorized that the epithet Geraistios (Γεραίστιος) also applies to Kalaureia because all three sanctuaries function as asylums.&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Another, older [[aetiology]] of the temple says that it was bartered for by Poseidon himself, who received it from Apollo in exchange for his share of [[Delphi]]. This story is attested by [[Callimachus]],&lt;ref&gt;Callimachus, Frag. 221&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] referencing [[Musaeus of Athens|Musaeus]],&lt;ref&gt;10.5.6&lt;/ref&gt; and Strabo referencing the history of [[Ephorus]].&lt;ref&gt;Geography, 8.6.14&lt;/ref&gt; Pausanias and Strabo both quote the following oracle: "For thee it is the same thing to possess Delos or Kalaureia / most holy Pytho [Delphi] or windy Taenarum."

Kalaureia was mentioned by [[Philostephanus]] in a lost work ''On Islands''.

It was to Kalaureia that [[Demosthenes]] the famous orator, condemned to death with his friends by the pro-Philip Macedonian party at Athens, fled and took sanctuary in Poseidon's sanctuary; as Antipater's officers closed in, he took poison and died, 16 October 322&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oskar Seyffert (classical scholar)|Oskar Seyffert]], ''Dictionary of Classical Antiquities,'' 1894:182.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Amphictyony}}
==Legendary amphictyony==
It is claimed by the Hellenistic historian [[Strabo]] that in the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic period]], an early [[amphictiony]], one of several Hellenic leagues of pre-classical times of which little is known, was centered on Kalaureia. Archaeology of the site suggested to Thomas Kelly that the sacred league was founded in the second quarter of the seventh century BCE, ca 680-650;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Kelly, "The Calaurian Amphictiony" ''American Journal of Archaeology'' '''70'''.2 (April 1966:113-121); Kelly, who summarized preceding literature, was reviving a date postulated by Ernest Curtius, with new reasoning. He suggested that the league could have been formed as a defensive pact against the expansive tyrant [[Pheidon|Pheidon of Argos]].&lt;/ref&gt; before that date there were virtually no remains at the site, which could not have been used more than sporadically.&lt;ref&gt;Some [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] objects found at the site related to a few ancient burials without connection to Poseidon. (Kelly 1966:115, 116).&lt;/ref&gt; A ''peribolos'' (περίβολος) wall enclosing the sanctuary site was built with the temple,&lt;ref&gt;The site of the temple was excavated in 1894 by the Swedish archaeologists Sam Wide and Lennart Kjellberg and published in 1895; it had become overgrown and forgotten by tourists in the 1960s but has been "rediscovered".&lt;/ref&gt; but there are no earlier traces of structures. The ''[[temenos]]'' or sanctuary dedicated to Poseidon, may have been linked to the sanctuaries at [[Geraestus (Euboea)|Geraistos]] and [[Tainaros]] (Ταίναρος).&lt;!--unsourced statement: anny support?--&gt; The island was known at one time as ''Eirene'' (Εἰρήνη) ("Peace"), clearly in reference to the amphictiony.&lt;ref&gt;In a fragment of [[Aristotle]] and in the [[Suda|Suidas]], ''s.v.'' "Kalaunia"&lt;!--Kalaunia"is the correct spelling here--&gt; (Kelly 1966:118 note 45).&lt;/ref&gt; A reference in Strabo gives a list of the ''[[Polis|poleis]]'' that belonged:
:''And there was also a kind of Amphictyonic League connected with this temple, a league of seven cities which shared in the sacrifice; they were [[Hermione (Argolis)|Hermione]], [[Epidaurus]], [[Aegina]], [[ancient Athens|Athens]], [[Prasïeis]], [[Nauplïeis]], and [[Orchomenus (Boeotia)|Orchomenus Minyeius]];&lt;ref&gt;That is, "Minyan Orchomenus, in [[Boeotia]]; the eighth-century date of Orchomenus' last access to the sea and the general agreement, following Strabo, that the league was a sea league, have affected the dating of the league.&lt;/ref&gt; however, the [[Argos|Argives]] paid dues for the Nauplians,&lt;ref&gt;That is, Argos took the place of Nauplia; the Argives destroyed Nauplia shortly after the [[Second Messenian War]], of uncertain date in the mid-seventh century.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Sparta|Lacedaemonians]] for the Prasians.''"&lt;ref&gt;That is, Sparta took the place of Prasïeis, which was conquered by Sparta shortly after the middle of the sixth century (Kelly 1966:119, noting [[Herodotus]], i.82)&lt;/ref&gt; (Strabo, ''Geography'' viii.6.14.)

[[Troezen]] and [[Poros]], which he considered the harbour of Troezen, Strabo omitted. However, there is no archaeological evidence to corroborate this list, and modern scholars believe that a feast in the ancient ''[[temenos]]'' celebrating the "revival" of the amphictiony, may have been based on a Hellenistic invention; the feast certainly existed: a third-century BCE plaque celebrating the "revival" of the Kalaureian League has been recovered.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Inscriptiones Graecae]]'' [http://epigraphy.packhum.org/inscriptions/oi?ikey=28372&amp;bookid=6&amp;region=2&amp;subregion=1 IV:842] (noted in Kelly 1966:121 note 70)&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Greco-Persian Wars]], the friendly connection between Athens and Troezen appears to have continued; and during the hegemony of the [[Athenian empire]] before the [[Thirty Years' Peace]] (455&amp;nbsp;BCE) Troezen was an ally of Athens, and was apparently garrisoned by Athenian troops; but by this peace the Athenians were compelled to relinquish Troezen. (19.29)

The Sanctuary was excavated by Swedish archaeologists in 1894.&lt;ref name="Berg, Ingrid (2016) Kalaureia 1894.

==History==
{{main|Mauryas|Ashoka|Buddhism}}
The remains of the excavations site at Kanaganahalli can be dated to between the 1st century BC to the 3rd century AD.

In circa the 1st century BC the [[stupa]] at Kanganhalli was constructed, as per the inscriptions referred to as ''Hama Chaitya'' and it was patronized by the Hinayana and Mahayana people during  the 3rd and 4th centuries AD. During the [[Shatavahana]] period, the [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district#Amaravati School|Amaravati School]] of art made a deep impact on the sculptural and architectural forms of Kanaganahalli region. This was indeed a period of great artistic efflorescence that gave the ''Maha chaitya'' here the most impressive form unsurpassed in the history of stupa architecture in the south India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The sculptured panels of the ''medhi'' are distinctly of native creation. The skill of making two dimensional sculptures and the carving of typical animal motifs are also of indigenous nature. Exhibit a transition phase between the early phase of Amaravati sculptural art and the elaborately sculptured panels of [[Nagarjunakonda]] with the sculptural panels found at Kanaganahalli stupa.

The volumes of their improvement over their Amaravati counterparts. The mastery of the artist of Kanganhalli in carving the ''geometric patterns, floral motifs, dress and ornamentation'' of the contemporary times and the concept of composition of the subject matter in the large sculptured panels.
 
The Kanaganahalli ''Maha Stupa'' is the veritable gallery of eminent rulers like King [[Ashoka]] and the [[Shatavahana]] rulers (Simuka, Pulumavi) are immortalized by depicting their portraits at Kanaganahalli.

Unlike the torana of Sanchi, Madhya Pradesh, portrait of emperor [[Ashoka]] is said to have depicted there is inscription found at Kanaganahalli.

At Kanganhalli up to the anda portion of the stupa is available, although majority of the architectural members and the sculptural panels are dislodged from the original position.

'''''Kayu ura''''' {{nihongo|粥占}} or '''''Mi kayu ura''''' {{nihongo|神粥占}} is a Japanese [[Shinto]] [[divination]] ritual using rice or bean [[gruel]].

Traditionally, the ''kayu ura'' ritual took place on the 15th day of the first [[Japanese calendar|lunar month]], but  since the adoption of the [[Gregorian calendar]] it has been conventional to perform the ceremony on January 15th; this date is known as ''ko-shōgatsu'' or "Little New Year".&lt;ref name="robertson2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robertson|first1=Stephen|title=Hope that sustains: revisiting New Year’s divination at Suwa Taisha|journal=Contemporary Japan|date=2016|volume=1|issue=28|pages=101–122|doi=10.1515/cj-2016-0006|url=https://www.degruyter.com/downloadpdf/j/cj.2016.28.issue-1/cj-2016-0006/cj-2016-0006.pdf|accessdate=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Divination by gruel is generally used for agricultural predictions; it is presumed to predict the weather and harvests for the coming year.&lt;ref name="EoS"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kentarō|first1=Suzuki|title=Kayu'ura|url=http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=796|website=Encyclopedia of Shinto|publisher=Kokugakuin University|accessdate=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ceremony takes various forms. A common practice is to stir a large pot of rice gruel ({{nihongo|粥|''kayu''}}) with a split wooden stick, and to observe the number and organisation of the grains that adhere to the stick when it is removed.&lt;ref name="EoS"/&gt; In another variation, known as ''tsutsugayu shinji'', multiple hollow cylinders made of split bamboo or reeds are placed in the gruel, each cylinder corresponding to a specific month. Shinto prayers are chanted and the rice porridge is then left overnight. The following morning, the cylinders are cut open and the contents examined – the more rice that has stuck to the inside of the tube, the more propitious the harvest. If multiple tubes are used, these usually correspond to specific months of the year, and the results are recorded on a month-by-month basis. The ''tsutsugayu shinji'' variation is practiced at the [[Suwa taisha|Suwa Grand Shrine]].&lt;ref name="robertson2016"/&gt;

Whilst rice is usually used, a porridge made from [[Adzuki bean|red beans]] (a symbol of fertility) can be substituted as an alternative.&lt;ref name="EoS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bocking2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Bocking|title=A Popular Dictionary of Shinto|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6d-RAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA12|date=30 September 2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-79739-3|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Satow,2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Satow,|title=Ancient Japanese Rituals|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XtsJBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT46|date=16 July 2014|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-79291-8|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A further variation on the ritual is used in [[Akita Prefecture|Akita]], in which the gruel is not stirred but is instead smeared on a wooden pole; predictions are made based on how much rice sticks to the pole and the patterns that it makes.&lt;ref name="Bocking2005"/&gt; The oldest form of this ceremony, and the precursor to those listed above, involves a Shinto priest examining the mould that has formed on a bowl of rice porridge that has been stored in a special box for several days.&lt;ref name="EoS"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ritual of Kayu-ura Kayubiraki|url=http://www.iimorijinja.jp/english.files/en0822/en/m05anlevent/parts/kayu_biraki.html|website=Imori Shrine|accessdate=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Lamashtu name.png|thumb|Sumerian name in [[Akkadian language|Old Babylonian]] [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]], &lt;sup&gt;[[dingir|d]]&lt;/sup&gt;''Dim&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-me''&lt;ref&gt;Hartmut Kühne ''[[Dūr-Katlimmu]] 2008 and beyond'' 2010 section 'The place of Lamashtu in the Near Eastern pantheon' [https://books.google.com/books?id=6KnKOTissFQC&amp;pg=PA243&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Page 243]  "If the demon Lamashtu can already be identified in old Assyrian texts9, the older attestation of her name is its Sumerian equation, DIMME, in an old Babylonian incantation10. "&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In [[Mesopotamian mythology]], '''Lamashtu''' ([[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] &lt;sup&gt;[[dingir|d]]&lt;/sup&gt;''La-maš-tu''; [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] ''Dimme'' &lt;sup&gt;[[dingir|d]]&lt;/sup&gt;''Dim&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-me'') was a female [[demon]], monster, malevolent goddess or demigoddess who menaced women during [[childbirth]] and, if possible, kidnapped their children while they were [[breastfeeding]]. She would gnaw on their bones and suck their blood, as well as being charged with a number of other evil deeds. She was a daughter of the Sky God [[Anu]].

Lamashtu is depicted as a [[mythological hybrid]], with a hairy body, a [[lion]]ess' head with [[donkey]]'s teeth and ears, long fingers and fingernails, and the feet of a [[bird]] with sharp [[Talon (anatomy)|talons]]. She is often shown standing or kneeling on a donkey, nursing a [[pig]] and a [[dog]], and holding [[snake]]s. She thus bears some functions and resemblance to the [[Mesopotamian]] demon [[Lilith]].

==Mythology==
Lamashtu's father was the Sky God [[Anu]] (Sumer [[Anu|An]]). Unlike many other usual demonic figures and depictions in [[Mesopotamian]] lore, Lamashtu was said to act in malevolence of her own accord, rather than at the gods' instructions. Along with this her name was written together with the [[cuneiform]] [[determinative]] indicating deity.&lt;ref&gt;Line 47 has &lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;dim-me, the superscript ''d'' being the divine determinative.[http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=c.4.22.1&amp;display=Crit&amp;charenc=gcirc&amp;lineid=c4221.46#c4221.46]&lt;/ref&gt; This means she was a goddess or a demigoddess in her own right.&lt;ref name=ancient&gt;{{Cite web|title=Ancient Near East: Lamashtu |url=http://www.ancientneareast.net/religion_mesopotamian/demons/lamashtu.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She bore seven names and was described as seven witches in incantations. Her evil deeds included (but were not limited to): slaying children, unborns, and [[neonate]]s; causing harm to mothers and expectant mothers; eating men and drinking their blood; disturbing sleep; bringing nightmares; killing foliage; infesting rivers and lakes; and being a bringer of disease, sickness, and death.&lt;ref name=ancient/&gt;

[[Pazuzu]], a god or demon, was invoked to protect birthing mothers and infants against Lamashtu's malevolence, usually on amulets and statues. Although Pazuzu was said to be bringer of famine and drought, he was also invoked against evil for protection, and against plague, but he was primarily and popularly invoked against his fierce, malicious rival Lamashtu.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Encyclopædia Britannica Article: Lamashtu |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9046921/Lamashtu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Incantation against Lamaštu:
 	
{{poemquote|Great is the daughter of Heaven who tortures babies
Her hand is a net, her embrace is death
She is cruel, raging, angry, predatory
A runner, a thief is the daughter of Heaven
She touches the bellies of women in labor
She pulls out the pregnant women's baby
The daughter of Heaven is one of the Gods, her brothers
With no child of her own.
Her head is a lion's head
Her body is a donkey's body
She roars like a lion
She constantly howls like a demon-dog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ancient Near East: Lamashtu |url=http://www.ancientneareast.net/religion_mesopotamian/demons/lamashtu.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041030071743/http://ancientneareast.net/religion_mesopotamian/demons/lamashtu.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2004-10-30 |df= }}{{cn|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==In modern culture==
 
* Lamashtu a demon lord and the goddess of monsters, called the Mother of Beasts and Mistress of Insanity, in the [[role-playing game]] setting ''[[Pathfinder (periodical)|Pathfinder]]''.
*Lamashtu appears as a character in the NBC television series [[Constantine (TV series)|''Constantine'']] in the episode "The Saint of Last Resorts".
* Lamashtu appears as an antagonist in the 2018 novel "On Devil's Wings" by M. J. Meade.
* Lamashtu appears as the antagonist in the 2017 film ''[[Still/Born]]''.      
*Lamashtu appears as the song "lamashtu" by Necrophobic on their 2018 album "Mark of the Necrogram"

==Ritual==
An Akkadian incantation and ritual against Lamashtu is edited in ''Texte aus der Umwelt des Alten Testaments'' vol. 2 (1988)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-due.de/Ev-Theologie/courses/course-stuff/meso-Lamashtu.html  TUAT 2,2, 259-26]&lt;/ref&gt;
It is glossed as an "incantation to  dispel lasting fever and Lamashtu".
The prescribed ritual involves a Lamashtu figurine. A sacrifice of bread must be placed before the figurine and water must be poured over it. A black dog must be made to carry the figurine. Then it is placed near the head of the sick child for three days, with the heart of a piglet placed in its mouth. The incantation must be recited three times a day, besides further food sacrifices. At dusk on the third day, the figurine is taken outdoors and buried near the wall.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2340">The [[Diocese|diocesan]] system of [[Catholic]] church government in [[Paraguay]] comprises only a Latin hierarchy, joint in the nation [[episcopal conference]], no Eastern Catholic jurisdiction :
* one [[ecclesiastical province]], headed by a Metropolitan [[archbishop]]. The provinces are in turn subdivided into eleven [[suffragan]] [[diocese]]s, each headed by a [[bishop]]. 
* two missionary, pre-diocesan (exempt) [[Apostolic vicariate|Apostolic Vicariates]] 
* the also exempt [[military Ordinariate]].

All defunct jurisdictions are direct precursors of current ones.

There is also an [[Apostolic Nunciature]] to Paraguay as papal diplomatic representation  (embassy level).

| [[Pharaoh]]s
| [[File:Tutmask.jpg|70px|center]]
| style="text-align:center;"| 3150&amp;nbsp;BCE–30&amp;nbsp;BCE
| Egyptian pharaohs were kings of [[Ancient Egypt]], and were considered gods by their culture. Their titles equated them with aspects of the likes of the hawk god [[Horus]], the vulture goddess [[Nekhbet]], and the cobra-goddess [[Wadjet]]. The Egyptians believed that when their Pharaoh died, he would continue to lead them in the next life, which is why his burial was grand and completed to perfection—to please him in the next life and ensure his immortality to protect his people.  See [[List of pharaohs]].&lt;ref&gt;"The rulers of Egypt, first the kings and later the pharaohs, were gods as well as men who ruled by divine right. Each king was 'the son of god', who at the point of death became one with his father, a god in a cosmic [[Heaven]]." Christopher Knight, Robert Lomas (August 1, 2001). The Hiram Key: Pharaohs, Freemasons and the Discovery of the Secret Scrolls of Jesus, 100. {{ISBN|978-1-931412-75-9}}. Available in print from Fair Winds.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The king had a [[superhuman]] role, being a manifestation of a god or of various deities on earth. The king's principle original title, the [[Horus]] name, proclaimed that he was an aspect of one of the chief gods, Horus, a sky god who was depicted as a falcon. Other identifications were added to this one, notably, "Son of [[Ra|Re]] &lt;nowiki&gt;[the sun god]&lt;/nowiki&gt;" and "Perfect God," both introduced during the 4th dynasty (''c.'' 2575–2465&amp;nbsp;BC), when the great [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]] were constructed. The epithet "Son of Re" placed the king in a close but dependent relation with the leading figure of the pantheon."{{cite book | author=Merriam-Webster | title=Encyclopedia of World Religions (Hardcover) | publisher=Merriam Webster, Incorporated | year=1999 | isbn=978-0-87779-044-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| Claimed, at least by [[Shinto|some Shintoists]], including government officials, to be divine descendants of the goddess [[Amaterasu]]. [[Hirohito]], the [[Shōwa period|Shōwa]] emperor, repudiated the "false conception" of his divinity in the [[Humanity Declaration]] in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chukai.ne.jp/~masago/ningen.html Hirohito's 1945 Declaration in Japanese and English]: "The ties between Us and Our people have always stood upon mutual trust and affection. They do not depend upon mere legends and myths. They are not predicated on the false conception that the Emperor is divine, and that the Japanese people are superior to other races and fated to rule the world."&lt;/ref&gt;

| Following [[Julius Caesar]] who in  42&amp;nbsp;BCE was formally deified as "the Divine Julius", and [[Caesar Augustus]] henceforth became ''Divi filius'' ("Son of the Divine One"), some (not all) Roman Emperors of the 1st to 4th centuries claimed divinity, including [[Tiberius]] 14–37, [[Caligula]] 37–41, [[Claudius]] 41–54, [[Hadrian]] 117–138, [[Commodus]] 161–192, [[Constantine I]] 306–312, [[Julian the Apostate]] 361–363

| The Natchez were a theocracy ruled by "The Great Sun." This ruler has sometimes been deemed a God-king.&lt;ref&gt;The community leader would be called the Great Sun. Natchez social organization was based on the relationship of community members to the Great Sun. In the 17th century, French explorers and colonists met this leader, who lived in a large house on the top of a platform mound at the site that is now preserved by the State of Mississippi as the Grand Village of the Natchez. The Great Sun enjoyed the status of a living god [https://web.archive.org/web/20051106032654/http://www.uark.edu/depts/contact/natchez.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The title was bestowed upon him by Egyptian priests of the god [[Amun|Ammon]] at the [[Oracle]] of the god at the [[Siwa Oasis|Siwah oasis]] in the [[Libyan Desert]].&lt;ref&gt;"Not the least of the many extraordinary facts about Alexander is that both in his lifetime and after his death he was worshipped as a god, by [[Greeks]] and [[Ancient Macedonians]] as well as, for example, Egyptians (to whom he was Pharaoh). The episode that led to [[Callisthenes]]' death in 327 was connected to this fact. Greeks and Ancient Macedonians believed that formal obeisance should be paid only to gods. So the refusal of his Greek and Macedonian courtiers to pay it to Alexander implied that they, at any rate, did not believe he genuinely was a living god, at least not in the same sense as Zeus or Dionysus were. Alexander, regardless, did nothing to discourage the view that he really was divine. His claim to divine birth, not merely divine descent, was part of a total self-promotional package, which included the striking of silver medallions in India depicting him with the attributes of [[Zeus]]. Through sheer force of personality and magnitude of achievement he won over large numbers of ordinary Greeks and Macedonians to share this view of himself, and to act on it by devoting shrines to his [[cult]]."{{cite journal |quotes= |last=Cartledge |first=Paul |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2004 |month= |title=Alexander the Great |journal=History Today |volume=54 |issue= |page=1 |id= |url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pauline epistles]] from the early second half of the 1st century CE offer the earliest references to Jesus as the [[Son of God]] (See {{Bibleref2|Romans|1}} for example). The [[First Council of Nicaea]] of 325 AD crystallized this notion in the [[Nicene creed]] and declared Jesus [[Incarnation (Christianity)|God Incarnate]]. Early Christian denominations with different christologies such as the [[Ebionites]] fell in popularity, and he is now considered divine in most [[Jesus in Christianity|Christian views of Jesus]] ([[God the Son]] in Trinitarian Christianity).

'''Matthew Fox''' (born '''Timothy James Fox''' on December 21, 1940) is an American [[priest]] and [[theology|theologian]].&lt;ref name="paper"&gt;[http://www.thepeterboroughexaminer.com/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=1467657 Step into environment fray] [[Peterborough Examiner]]{{dead link|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formerly a member of the [[Dominican Order]] within the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]], he became a member of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] following his expulsion from the order in 1993. Fox was an early and influential exponent{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} of a movement that came to be known as Creation Spirituality. The movement draws inspiration from the mystical philosophies of such medieval Catholic visionaries as [[Hildegard of Bingen]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Saint Francis of Assisi]], [[Julian of Norwich]], [[Dante Alighieri]], [[Meister Eckhart]] and [[Nicholas of Cusa]], as well as the wisdom and prophetic traditions of Jewish scriptures. Creation Spirituality is also strongly aligned with ecological and environmental movements of the late 20th century and embraces numerous spiritual traditions around the world, including [[Buddhism]], [[Judaism]], [[Sufism]], and [[Native American spirituality]], with a focus on "deep [[ecumenism]]" or interfaith.

Fox has written 35 books that have been translated into 68 languages and have sold millions of copies and by the mid-1990s had attracted a "huge and diverse following".&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&amp;dat=19930328&amp;id=qH8UAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=UQMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6860,7361701 Vallalongo, Fred and Sally.

'''Timothy James Fox''', was born in [[Madison, Wisconsin]]. In 1960, when he entered the Roman Catholic [[Dominican Order|Order of Preachers]] he was given the [[religious name]] of "Matthew". He received [[master's degree]]s in both [[philosophy]] and [[theology]] from the Aquinas Institute of Philosophy and Theology and later earned a Doctorate of spiritual theology, summa cum laude, from the [[Institut Catholique de Paris]], studying with [[Marie-Dominique Chenu]] who named the Creation Spirituality tradition for him. It was [[Thomas Merton]], the catholic monk, who steered Fox to study at the Institut catholique de Paris. After receiving his doctorate, Fox began teaching at a series of Catholic universities, including [[Loyola University Chicago|Loyola University]] in Chicago and [[Barat College]] of the Sacred Heart in Lake Forest, Il.

In 1976, Fox moved to Chicago’s [[Mundelein College]] (now part of [[Loyola University Chicago|Loyola University]]), to start the Institute of Culture and Creation Spirituality, a master's program in Creation Spirituality with a unique pedagogy that integrated both left and right brain centers and would eventually lead to conflict with church authorities. His holistic pedagogy included among its faculty Jungian psychologist John Giannini and physicist/cosmologist Brian Swimme, feminist Rosemary Reuther along with many artists teaching “art as meditation.” In 1983, Fox moved the Institute of Culture and Creation Spirituality to [[Oakland, California]], and began teaching at [[Holy Names University]], where he was a professor for 12 years.&lt;ref&gt;Burack, Charles. "Adventures in Creation Spirituality", ''Interreligious Insight''; Vol. 8, Number 2 July 2010 pp. 62–65&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984 [[Pope Benedict XVI|Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger]], the head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, asked the Dominican Order to investigate Fox’s writings. When three Dominican theologians examined his works and did not find his books heretical, Ratzinger ordered a second review, which was never undertaken.&lt;ref name=wroe&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/turbulent-priest-ministers-to-the-new-age-soul-martin-wroe-meets-the-friar-delivering-pagan-heresy-to-packed-churches-1533115.html Wroe, Martin. "Turbulent Priest Ministers to the New Age Soul", ''The Independent'', UK, July 14, 1992]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.democracynow.org/2013/2/28/fascism_in_the_church_ex_priest#transcript Fascism in the Church: Ex-Priest on "The Pope’s War," Clergy Abuse and Quelling Liberation Theology]. Intervew. ''[[Democracy Now!]]'', February 28, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to his questioning of the doctrine of original sin, in 1988 Fox was forbidden from teaching or lecturing for a year by Ratzinger. Fox wrote a “Pastoral Letter to Cardinal Ratzinger and the Whole Church,” calling the Catholic church a dysfunctional family. After a year "sabbatical" Fox resumed writing, teaching, and lecturing. In 1991 his Dominican superior ordered Fox to leave the ICCS in California and return to Chicago or face dismissal. Fox refused. In 1993, Fox’s conflicts with Catholic authorities climaxed with his expulsion from the Dominican order for "disobedience," effectively ending his professional relationship with the church and his teaching at its universities.

Among the issues Ratzinger objected to were his feminist theology; calling God "Mother;" preferring the concept of Original Blessing over Original Sin; working too closely with Native Americans; not condemning homosexuality; and teaching the four paths of creation spirituality—the ''Via Positiva'', ''Via Negativa'', ''Via Creativa'' and ''Via Transformativa'' instead of the church’s classical three paths of [[State (theology)|purgation, illumination and union]].&lt;ref name=molly&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/17/garden/at-supper-with-matthew-fox-roman-catholic-rebel-becomes-a-cause-celebre.html?scp=1&amp;sq=&amp;st=nyt |title=A Supper with Matthew Fox; Roman Catholic Rebel Becomes a Cause Celebre|author=Molly O’Neill |newspaper=New York Times |date= March 17, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in ''The New York Times'', Molly O'Neill says that the Vatican was presented with a request on the part of the Dominicans that the theologian be dismissed.&lt;ref name=molly/&gt; According to John L. Allen, Jr., it was largely in reaction to the unconventional programming at his Institute for Creation Spirituality, with a faculty that included a masseuse, a Zen Buddhist, a yoga teacher, and a self-described witch named [[Starhawk]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.natcath.org/NCR_Online/archives/022103/022103a.htm Allen, Jr., John L., "Vatican looks at 'New Age,' issues 'appeal to discernment'", ''National Catholic Reporter'', February 21, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Episcopal priest===
After his expulsion, Fox met young [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] activists in England who were using "raves" as a way to bring life back to their liturgy and to attract young people to church worship. He was inspired to begin holding his own series of “Techno Cosmic Masses” in Oakland and other U.S. cities, events designed to connect people to a more ecstatic and visceral celebration and relationship with ritual and the building of community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/22/magazine/raving-my-religion.html?scp=1&amp;sq=matthew+fox&amp;st=nyt |title=Making a Joyful Noise: Rev. Matthew Fox Hopes His Sweaty Rave Masses Will Change the Way We Pray, Raving My Religion|newspaper= New York Times Magazine |date= June 22, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fox was received into the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] ([[Anglican Communion]]) as a priest in 1994 by [[Bishop]] [[William Swing]] of the [[Episcopal Diocese of California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Fox | first=Matthew | coauthors= | title=Confessions: the making of a postdenominational priest | year=1996 | publisher=HarperSanFrancisco | location=[San Francisco, Calif.]  | isbn=0-06-062965-7 | pages=250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Fox founded the University of Creation Spirituality in Oakland, an outgrowth of his institutes at Mundelein and Holy Names. The university offered similar master's degree programs in creation spirituality and related studies. It was initially accredited through an affiliation with [[New College of California]], before shifting in 1999 to affiliate with the [[Naropa Institute]] of Boulder, Colorado, creating and running Naropa’s master's degree program. The university also added a separate doctorate of ministry degree, with a curriculum based on his 1993 book ''The Reinvention of Work: A New Vision of Livelihood for Our Time'', which talked about a "priesthood of all workers".&lt;ref name="sfgate.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1999/02/05/MN101144.DTL |title=East-West Naropa Institute Plans to Open in Oakland: Move is part of Jerry Brown's downtown plan|author=Rick DelVecchio |newspaper= San Francisco Chronicle |date= Feb 5, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fox led the University of Creation Spirituality for nine years, then was succeeded as president by James Garrison in 2005. The institution was subsequently renamed Wisdom University.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wisdomuniversity.org/aboutus.htm Wisdom University]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since leaving the university, Fox has continued to lecture, write and publish books. In 2005, he founded an educational organization geared to reach out to inner city youth called Youth and Elder Learning Laboratory for Ancestral Wisdom Education (YELLAWE).  The YELLAWE program is based on a holistic approach to education and creativity derived from Fox’s master’s level programs. It also includes physical training in bodily meditation practices such as tai chi. YELLAWE has operated in inner-city school systems in Oakland and Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2010/09/17/1700146/a-mystic-brings-lessons-in-awe.html?commentSort=TimeStampAscending&amp;pageNum=1 |title=A mystic brings lessons in awe and creativity: In Charlotte, Matthew Fox will share what he thinks today's Christianity needs to thrive|author=Lynn Trenning|newspaper= Charlotte Observer |date=September 18, 2010}}{{dead link|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fox's proponents hold that his teachings are more gender neutral, ecology sensitive, and accepting of non-traditional sexuality, than church orthodoxy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1998/11/03/MN55342.DTL Watanabe, Teresa. "Seeking the Feminine in God: Goddess worship accentuates female origins of the Almighty", ''The Los Angeles Times'', November 3, 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation Spirituality==
While some academic theologians refer to Fox as the next [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Neill|first=Molly|title=At Supper With -- Matthew Fox; Roman Catholic Rebel Becomes A Cause Celebre|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/17/garden/at-supper-with-matthew-fox-roman-catholic-rebel-becomes-a-cause-celebre.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|accessdate=8 March 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=17 March 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; others call him a populizer, not an intellectual.&lt;ref&gt;ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Brow characterizes the teachings as "esoteric excursions into ethics, theology, and mysticism".&lt;ref name=brow/&gt;

===Basic tenets===
{{BLP unsourced section|date=December 2010}}
Fox’s conception of Creation Spirituality draws on both a close reading of biblical sources and early medieval mystics within Christian traditions as well as today's science. It seeks common ground with numerous faiths from around the world, in an approach Fox called “deep ecumenism” for its connections across many spiritual practices. This was described most particularly in his book ''One River, Many Wells: Wisdom Springing from Global Faiths''.

Creation Spirituality considers itself a “green” theology, emphasizing a holy relationship between humanity and nature. Accordingly, the sacredness of nature is considered a sacrament and creation is considered an expression of God and the “Cosmic Christ”. This approach was endorsed by eco-theologian [[Thomas Berry]] among others. Fox’s book ''The Coming of the Cosmic Christ: The Healing of Mother Earth and the Birth of a Global Renaissance'' delves more into these issues.

Fox also laid out other tenets of Creation Spirituality in some of his other books, particularly ''Original Blessing,'' ''A Spirituality Named Compassion,'' and ''Creation Spirituality: Liberating Gifts for the People of the Earth''.

Fox’s 1996 autobiography, ''Confessions: The Making of a Post-Denominational Priest'', describes his life as a Dominican priest and his struggle with the Vatican as he wrote about his experiences and understanding of early Christianity. This book was updated and published by North Atlantic Books in 2016.

Fox also has authored or edited nearly 35 other books, largely on various spiritual teachings, teachers and mystics (listed below). He was the first to translate Meister Eckhart into English from the critical German editions along with a commentary on his work and helped to launch the Hildegard of Bingen revival.  His book on the mysticism of Thomas Aquinas translates many of his works that have never before been translated into English, German or French.

Fox's theological positions have been categorized as a type of [[monism]], specifically [[panentheism]].&lt;ref name=brow&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.brow.on.ca/Articles/NewAgeProphet.html |title=The Taming of a New Age Prophet|author=Robert Brow |newspaper= Christianity Today |date=June 16, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fox's theology has received plaudits from noted spiritual figures including [[Dom Bede Griffiths, OSB]], who said: "“(Matthew Fox’s) creation spirituality is the spirituality of the future and his Theology of the Cosmic Christ is the theology of the future.” &lt;ref&gt;Excerpt from: audio tape, “Spirituality for a New Era: Dialog with Matthew Fox and Bede Griffiths,” September 1992, Holy Names College, Oakland, California&lt;/ref&gt; About the 25th anniversary edition of ''Original Blessing'', John Cobb, professor emeritus at the [[Claremont School of Theology]], wrote: "Fox's accomplishment in ''Original Blessing'' was more than to recover a form of spirituality that had been obscured and to show its profound relevance and importance for our time.  He used spirituality as an avenue into the depths of Christian faith and theology in general...Gradually the book is assuming the status of a classic.  In due course, it will take its place in the history of spirituality and indeed in the history of theology."&lt;ref&gt;Cobb, John, quoted in [https://www.amazon.com/Original-Blessing-Spirituality-Presented-Twenty-Six/dp/1585420670" Original Blessing], Matthew Fox (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Techno Cosmic Mass===
Fox's "Techno Cosmic Mass" (more recently called "Cosmic Mass") is an attempt to combine the religious ritual of the [[Eucharist]] with dance and multimedia material, deejays, video jockeys and rap music. They evoke and connect spiritual rituals and the ecstatic energy of [[Techno music]] and [[rave party|rave parties]]. They developed from a group called the [[Nine O'Clock Service]] in [[Sheffield, England]], in the late 1980s and early 1990s and were brought to the United States and further developed by Fox.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=bytLAKa2liUC&amp;pg=PA204&amp;lpg=PA204&amp;dq=Techno+Cosmic+Mass&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5XwLPCwqI_&amp;sig=5wxGQbwclRPMESPW4qksxDz_PEw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=dmNOStuzGJGgswOq8LmqDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8 The Way We Pray]'' by Maggie Oman Shannon, Conari Press, {{ISBN|1-57324-571-2}}, p. 204-206&lt;/ref&gt; Over 100 Cosmic Masses have been celebrated in North America and numerous persons have studied how to present them.

===95 theses===
In 2005, while preparing for a presentation in [[Germany]] and following the election of Ratzinger as [[Pope Benedict XVI]], Fox created 95 theses that he then translated into [[German language|German]]. On the weekend of [[Pentecost]], arrangements were made for him to nail these to the door of the [[Wittenberg]] church where [[Martin Luther]] nailed the original [[95 Theses]] in the 16th century, an act often associated with the [[Protestant Reformation]].&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=892xGwAACAAJ&amp;dq=Matthew+Fox+A+New+Reformation A New Reformation]'', Matthew Fox, (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

The action fueled the creation of a lively blog involving tens of thousands of Germans. In his theses, Fox called for a new reformation in Western Christianity. In his supporting book, ''A New Reformation'', Fox argued that two Christianities already exist and it is time for a new reformation to acknowledge that fact and move the Western spiritual tradition into new directions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ekklesia.co.uk/content/news_syndication/article_2005_06_7_3333.shtml Theologian Nails 95 Theses for a New Reformation], [[Ekklesia (think tank)]], 7 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

{{italic title}}
'''''Meminisse iuvat''''' (14 July 1958)  is an [[encyclical]] of [[Pope Pius XII]], asking for prayers of the [[persecuted]] [[Christian Church|Church]] in the East and criticizing  harmful cultural developments in the West. He asks for a [[novena]] of prayer preceding the feast of the [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]].

The encyclical reminds its readers, that during the [[Second World War]] the Pope did not simply preach peace or work on better understanding between the war parties. Most importantly, he consecrated the whole human race to the [[Immaculate Heart of Mary]], the mother of God. Twelve years later, war is over, but peace has not yet arrived. The new atomic weapons can annihilate not only the vanquished but also the victors.

== Critique of the West ==
The problems and crisis of humanity continue to exist, because God, the source and guarantor of justice, the fountain of truth, the basis of all laws, is denied his proper place or, worse, completely disregarded. If a house is not built on a solid and sure foundation, it tumbles down; if a mind is not enlightened by the divine light, it strays more or less from the whole truth; if citizens, peoples, and nations are not animated by brotherly love, strife is born, waxes strong, and reaches full growth.&lt;ref&gt;''Meminisse iuvat'', 4&lt;/ref&gt;
Christianity teaches the full truth, real justice, and divine charity, which drives away hate, bad intentions and enmity. A return to Christian principles would establish a society that is strong, just, and equitable. The Pope is firmly convinced that, whatever the obstacles or persecutions, Christianity will always win over her enemies. "It is a harmful and reckless policy to do battle with Christianity, for God guarantees, and history testifies, that she shall exist forever."&lt;ref&gt;''Meminisse iuvat'', 5&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, in some unnamed countries - the Pope clearly points to the West - Christian principles and the Catholic religion are not given their proper place. Unsuspecting and uneducated young people easily fall for the temptations of seductive allurements of vice, as writers and publishers and movies continue to stir up vicious and violent appetites solely for the sake of gain.

== Persecution in the East ==
{{Modern persecutions of the Catholic Church}}
In the East, persecutions against the Church continue. As a result, many bishops have been driven from their sees or so impeded that they cannot freely exercise their ministry; they have even been cast into prison or exiled. In those countries, newspapers, magazines, and other publications put out by Catholics have been almost completely silenced, as if truth were subject to the exclusive control and discretion of political rulers, and as though divine and human learning and the liberal arts need not be free if they are to flourish for the public and common good.&lt;ref&gt;''Meminisse iuvat''&lt;/ref&gt; Catholic schools are closed or replaced with institutes of the State which teach nothing at all about God or religion.  Missionaries are expelled, jailed or unable to help the faithful. Governments choose and appoint bishops, as if the Catholic Church were a creature of a single nation, dependent on its civil authority, and not a divine institution extending to all peoples.&lt;ref&gt;''Meminisse iuvat'', 13–15&lt;/ref&gt;

But most of the faithful, of both the Latin and the Oriental rites, are practicing and defending their ancestral faith tenaciously. Gratefully, the Pope exhorts those who are under many dangerous and deceitful pressures - pressures which would urge them to stop supporting the firm, solid, and constant unity of the Church: "He who does not have the Church as his mother, cannot have God as his father. The Church, founded by Christ can be attacked, but not defeated, for she draws her strength from God, not from man. Just as Christ our Redeemer rose in triumph, so the Church shall some day win a peaceful victory over all her enemies."&lt;ref&gt;''Meminisse iuvat'', 24&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pope encourages the faithful in the East to have confidence, and to be brave and steadfast soldiers, quoting St. Ignatius, the martyr: "We wish to counsel you in the words of St. Ignatius, martyr, although We know you do not require such counsel: "Serve him for whom you fight. ... May none of you desert him! Your baptism must be a shield; your faith a helmet; your charity a lance; your patience a suit of armour. Your works should be your credentials, so that you may be worthy to receive your reward." &lt;ref&gt;''Meminisse iuvat'', 25&lt;/ref&gt;

== Church will triumph  ==
Empires and mighty states have fallen but the Church stands unmoved among the waves of this world, for she is built on the apostolic rock and holds fast to her foundation, unmoved by the onslaughts of the raging sea. Nothing can even shake her, Pope Pius teaches, because, as many physical elements of this world crash with thunder around her, she continues to provide a safe port. As half of Christianity suffers persecution, the other half is united with their brothers and sisters in prayer, that better times may quickly come upon the whole Church.&lt;ref&gt;''Meminisse iuvat'', 26&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Merkos L'Inyonei Chinuch''' ({{lang-he|מרכז לענייני חינוך}}, lit. Central Organization for Education) is the central educational arm of the [[Chabad-Lubavitch]] movement. It was founded in 1943 by the sixth Rebbe, Rabbi [[Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn]], who appointed his son-in-law, Rabbi [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]], who would later become the seventh Rebbe, as its chairman and director. Today, Rabbi [[Chaim Yehuda Krinsky]] serves as chairman.&lt;ref&gt;Mishpacha magazine, June 25, 2014 Y. Besser&lt;/ref&gt;

Merkos L'Inyonei Chinuch is the official body responsible for establishing Chabad centers across the globe. Its vice-chairman Rabbi [[Moshe Kotlarsky]] oversees the global network of emissaries, approves new centers, and directs the annual international conference of [[Chabad]] emissaries.&lt;ref&gt;http://forward.com/forward-50-2008/#religion&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roving Rabbis==
One of the best known divisions is the Merkos Shlichus campaign, which dispatches pairs of young rabbinical students, colloquially known as '''Roving Rabbis''', to small and isolated Jewish communities around the world. Hundreds of rabbinical students participate in Passover and summer visitation programs, building Jewish awareness and spreading Torah knowledge.&lt;ref name="diego"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sdjewishjournal.com/site/1136/special-delivery/ |title=Special Delivery |last=Berman |first=Alanna |date=September 2010 |accessdate=25 September 2010 |publisher=[[San Diego Jewish Journal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.jrn.columbia.edu/site/coveringreligion/2009/05/04/the-search-for-jews-in-ireland/ |title=The Search for Jews in Ireland |last=Donath |first=Mirjam |date=4 May 2009 |accessdate=25 September 2010 |publisher=Beyond the Brogue |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20090827061945/http://blog.jrn.columbia.edu/site/coveringreligion/2009/05/04/the-search-for-jews-in-ireland/ |archivedate=27 August 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.albertalocalnews.com/reddeeradvocate/news/Judaism_in_a_suitcase_52073052.html?period=W&amp;mpStartDate=08-14-2010&amp; |title=Judaism in a Suitcase |last=Tester |first=Laura |date=30 July 2009 |accessdate=25 September 2010 |publisher=[[Red Deer Advocate]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, the program has sent students to more than 150 countries.&lt;ref name="chabad"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/706006/jewish/About-Merkos-Shlichus.htm |title=About the Student Summer Visitation Program |accessdate=25 September 2010 |publisher=chabad.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rabbinical Student Visitation Program began in 1943, when Rabbi Schneerson dispatched the first pairs of students to ten cities in [[Upstate New York]]. Cities in [[California]] were added to the program in 1944, as were cities in the [[Southern United States]] in 1945. By 1948, the summer program numbered 20 students and 100 American cities. Students were also sent to Jewish farmers residing throughout the [[Northeastern United States]], many of whom were European immigrants. The students were sent in pairs, usually one American student and one European-immigrant student.&lt;ref name="chabad"/&gt;

In the early 1950s, the Rebbe added international destinations to the summer program, personally consulting maps and planning the itineraries.&lt;ref name="chabad"/&gt;

Currently, 400 Roving Rabbis participate in the annual summer program. They distribute thousands of [[mezuzah|mezuzot]], other religious articles such as [[tefillin]] and [[kosher]] food, and tens of thousands of Jewish information packets each year.&lt;ref name="chabad"/&gt;

The students interact with both individuals and families. They often go door to door, teaching women how to light [[Shabbat candles]] and showing men how to put on [[tefillin]] for the first time. They speak about Jewish education, answer questions, and give [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah|bar mitzvah]] lessons.&lt;ref name="diego"/&gt;

Their visits are often anticipated by the local population. On their 2010 swing through the islands of [[Aruba]], [[Bonaire]] and [[Curaçao]], for example, the two Roving Rabbis were summoned to the office of Aruba Prime Minister [[Mike Eman]], who is Jewish. Eman spoke with them about Jewish heritage, listened as they blew the [[shofar]] (it was the Hebrew month of [[Elul]], when the shofar is blown daily in [[synagogue]]s), and donned a pair of tefillin. After completing their visit to the islands, the students returned to the Prime Minister's office so he could put on tefillin again, and he asked them to arrange for him to have his own pair of tefillin.&lt;ref name="prime"&gt;Marks, Yehudah. ''Jewish Prime Minister of Aruba Orders Pair of Tefillin''. [[Hamodia]], World News, 2 September 2010, p. B42.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roving Rabbis share their experiences and communicate with each other on their own blog site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chabad.org/blogs/rovingrabbis.htm |title=Roving Rabbis blog |accessdate=25 September 2010 |publisher=Chabad-Lubavitch Media Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Fiqh |marital}}

A '''''misyar'' marriage'''' ({{lang-ar|نكاح المسيار|nikah al-misyar}} or more often {{lang|ar|زواج المسيار}} ''zawaj al-misyar'' "traveller's marriage") is a type of [[Marriage in Islam|marriage contract]] in [[Sunni Islam]] (some aspects are similar to ''[[Nikah mut'ah|mutah]]'' marriage in [[Shia Islam]]). The husband and wife thus joined are able to renounce to some marital rights such as living together, the wife's rights to housing and maintenance money (''[[nafaqa]]''), and the husband's right to homekeeping and access.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&amp;cid=1119503544160 Al-Qaradawi, Yusuf : Misyar marriage]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104035953/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar%2FFatwaE%2FFatwaE&amp;cid=1119503544160 |date=January 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and causes==
Some people{{who|date=February 2016}} consider that the ''misyar'' marriage can meet the needs of young people whose resources are too limited to settle down in a separate home; of divorcees, widows or widowers, who have their own residence and their own financial resources but cannot or do not want to marry again according to the usual formula, and of slightly older people who have not experienced marriage.

Some [[Islamic lawyers]]{{who|date=September 2018}} add that this type of marriage fits the needs of a conservative society which punishes [[zina (Arabic)|''zina'']] ([[fornication]]) and other sexual relationships which are established outside a marriage contract. Thus, some Muslim foreigners working in the Persian Gulf countries prefer to engage in ''misyar'' marriage rather than live alone for years. Many of them are actually already married with wives and children in their home country, but they cannot bring them to the region.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

== In practice ==
The Sheikh of [[al-Azhar mosque]], [[Muhammad Sayyid Tantawi]] and theologian [[Yusuf Al-Qaradawi]] note in their writings and in their lectures that a major proportion of the men who take a spouse in the framework of the ''misyar'' marriage are already married men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arabnews.com/?page=9&amp;section=0&amp;article=64891|title=Arab News|website=Arab News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legality==
Misyar marriage fits within the general rules of marriage in [[Sunni]] law, on condition merely that it fulfill all the requirements of the [[Shariah]] marriage contract, i.e.:
* The agreement of both parties
* Two legal witnesses (''shahidain'')
* The payment by the husband to his wife of ''[[mahr]]'' (dower) in the amount that is agreed&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&amp;cid=1119503544160 Al-Qaradawi, Yusuf : Misyar marriage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104035953/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar%2FFatwaE%2FFatwaE&amp;cid=1119503544160 |date=2011-01-04 }} et Zawaj al misyar, p 11&lt;/ref&gt;
* The absence of a fixed time period for the contract
* Any particular stipulations (''shuroot'') which the two parties agree to include in the contract and which are in conformity with Muslim marriage law

However, there have been some [[Sunni]] scholars and organizations that have opposed the concept of ''Nikah Misyar'' altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cifiaonline.com/prostitutionlegalized.htm|title=Prostitution Legalized|website=CIF INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the view of the Saudi [[Islamic lawyer]] and member of the Higher Council of Ulema of Saudi Arabia Abdullah bin Sulaiman bin Menie, the wife can, at any time as she sees fit, retract her renunciation of her financial rights and require of her husband that he give her all of her marital rights, including that he live with her and provide for her financial needs (''nafaqa''). The husband can then either do so, or grant her a divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gulfnews.com/Articles/RegionNF.asp?ArticleID=165873|title=quoted by Al-Hakeem, Mariam : Misyar marriage gaining prominence among Saudis|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For these reasons, Professor [[Yusuf Al-Qaradawi]] observes that he does not promote this type of marriage, although he has to recognise that it is legal, since it fulfills all the requirements of the usual marriage contract.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Qaradawi, Yusuf : Zawaj al misyar p.8&lt;/ref&gt; He states his preference that the clause of renunciation be not included within the marriage contract, but be the subject of a simple verbal agreement between the parties.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Qaradawi, Yusuf : Zawaj al misyar , pp.13-14&lt;/ref&gt; He underlines the fact that Muslims are held by their commitments, whether they are written or verbal.

==Criticism==
''Misyar'' has been suggested by some authors to be a comparable marriage with ''[[Nikah mut'ah]]'' (temporary marriage) and that they find it for the sole purpose of "sexual gratification in a licit manner".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zEkmJAeJYBkC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=misyar+muta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7gpFUZatJtL02wXPrYDYCw&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=misyar+muta&amp;f=false|title=Islam and the West: The Clash Between Islamism and Secularism|first=Mushtaq K.|last=Lodi|date=1 July 2011|publisher=Strategic Book Publishing|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S2kZfdrEBlAC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=misyar+mut'a&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jQ1FUYanDaP02gWCk4GADQ&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=campaigns+Encyclopedia+&amp;f=false|title=The Islamic Shield: Arab Resistance to Democratic and Religious Reforms|first=Elie|last=Elhadj|date=30 July 2017|publisher=Universal-Publishers|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Karen Ruffle, assistant professor of religion at the University of Toronto, even though ''mutʿah'' is prohibited by Sunni schools of law, several types of impermanent marriage exist, including ''misyar'' (ambulant) marriage and [[Nikah 'urfi|''ʿurfi'']] (customary) marriage, which gained popularity in parts of the Sunni world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195390155/obo-9780195390155-0055.xml?rskey=0mBLTN&amp;result=77&amp;q=|title=Mutʿa - Islamic Studies - Oxford Bibliographies - obo|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
According to Florian Pohl, assistant professor of religion at Oxford College, ''misyar'' marriage is controversial issue in the Muslim world, as many see it as practice that encourages marriages for purely sexual purposes, or that it is used as a cover for a form of prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n4Eye4ilLVkC&amp;pg=PA50&amp;dq=Mutah&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=l0VdUeCnM4ajiAfXnoCgCQ&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwATgU#v=onepage&amp;q=Mutah&amp;f=false | title=Muslim World: Modern Muslim Societies | publisher=Marshall Cavendish | date=September 1, 2010 | accessdate=April 5, 2013 | author=Pohl, Florian | pages=52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Islamic scholars like [[Ibn Uthaimeen]] or [[Al-Albani]] claim, for their part, that ''misyar'' marriage may be legal but not moral. They agree that the wife can reclaim the rights which she gave up at the time of contract at any time.&lt;ref name="BinMenie"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bab-albahrain.net/forum/showthread.php?p=329473#post329473|title=Bin Menie, Abdullah bin Sulaïman : fatwa concerning the misyar marriage (and opinions by Ibn Uthaymeen, Al-albany) (in Arabic)] [http://www.metimes.com/articles/normal.php?StoryID=20000407-042210-7478r Yet another marriage with no strings - fatwa committee of al azhar against misyar|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, they are opposed to this type of marriage on the grounds that it contradicts the spirit of the Islamic law of marriage and that it has perverse effects on the woman, the family, and the community in general.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Some ''ulama'' (scholars) have issued [[Fatwa|''fatwas'']] (legal opinions) in which they contend that ''misyar'' is ''[[zina]]'' (fornication).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8ep7cX3ma0sC&amp;pg=PA165&amp;dq=44+misyar+107&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q=misyar%20107&amp;f=false | title=Sharia Incorporated: A Comparative Overview of the Legal Systems of Twelve Muslim Countries in Past and Present | publisher=Amsterdam University Press | year=2010 | accessdate=2013-04-10 | author=Otto, J.M. | pages=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Al-Albani]], ''misyar'' marriage may even be considered as illicit, because it runs counter to the objectives and the spirit of marriage in Islam, as described in this verse from the Quran :&lt;blockquote&gt;"And among His Signs is this, that He created for you mates from among yourselves, that ye may dwell in tranquility with them, and He has put love and mercy between your (hearts)…"&lt;ref&gt;Quran, 30 : 21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Al-Albani also underlines the social problems which can result from the ''misyar'' marriage, particularly in the event that children are born from this union. The children raised by their mother in a home from which the father is always absent without reason may suffer difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;Wassel quoted in Hassouna addimashqi, Arfane : Nikah al misyar (2000), (in Arabic), p 16)&lt;/ref&gt;


[[Ibn Baaz]] was asked about ''misyar'' marriage with the intention of divorce. He replied that it is permissible, and he along with Permanent Council (of Muftis), decreed that it is permissible. &lt;blockquote&gt;"Someone asked him: In one of your tapes, you have a fatwa that it is permissible for someone in a Western country to get married with the intention of getting divorced after a specific period. What is the difference between this and between Mut'ah?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Response: Yes, this fatwa has come from Permanent Council (of Muftis), and I am its leader, and we have ruled that it is permissible to marry with the intention of getting divorced, if this intention is between the servant and his Lord. If someone marries in a Western country, and his intention is that when he finishes his studies or finds a job or something like this that he will get divorced, then there is absolutely no problem with this in the opinion of all 'ulama. This intention is something between the servant and Allah, and is not a condition. The difference between this and Mut'ah is that Mut'ah has the condition of a definite time period, such as a month or two months or a year or two years and so forth. If the time period fends, then the Nikah is abrogated. This is the invalid form Mut'ah. However, if somebody marries according to the Sunnah of Allah and the Prophet, but he nonetheless holds the intention in his heart that when he leaves the (Western) country he will divorce, then there is no harm it. This intention might change, and so it is not something definite. This intention is not a condition, and it is something between the servant and his Lord. There is no harm in it, and it is one of the ways that a person may remain chaste and avoid fornication and debauchery. This is the statement of all people of knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.binbaz.org.sa/last_resault.asp?hID=323 |title=Website of Bin Baz |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date= |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040120111040/http://www.binbaz.org.sa/last_resault.asp?hID=323 |archivedate=January 20, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Ibn Baaz]] was also asked:&lt;blockquote&gt;"this kind of marriage is where the man marries a second, third or fourth wife, and the wife is in a situation that compels her to stay with her parents or one of them in her own house, and the husband goes to her at various times depending on the circumstances of both. What is the Islamic ruling on this type of marriage?"&lt;/blockquote&gt;He replied:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"There is nothing wrong with that if the marriage contract fulfills all the conditions set out by sharee’ah, which is the presence of the wali and the consent of both partners, and the presence of two witnesses of good character to the drawing up of the contract, and both partners being free of any impediments, because of the general meaning of the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): 'The conditions that are most deserving of being fulfilled are those by means of which intimacy becomes permissible for you' and 'The Muslims are bound by their conditions.' If the partners agree that the woman will stay with her family or that her share of the husband's time will be during the day and not during the night, or on certain days or certain nights, there is nothing wrong with that, so long as the marriage is announced and not hidden."&lt;ref&gt;Fataawa ‘Ulama’ al-Balad al-Haraam (p. 450, 451) and Jareedah al-Jazeerah issue no. 8768,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, some students of [[Ibn Baaz]] said that he later retracted the view that it is permissible, but no writings have been found to prove that.

Earlier ''ulama'' (scholars) also noted consensus upon ''misyar'' marriage with the intention of divorce. [[Al-Nawawi]] wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Qazi said: ‘There is an unanimous agreement that whoever performs permanent marriage but his intent is to stay with her for a specific period, verily his marriage is valid, and it is not Mut’ah marriage, because Mut’ah marriage is based on a conditional period."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://library.islamweb.net/newlibrary/display_book.php?idfrom=4124&amp;idto=4157&amp;bk_no=53&amp;ID=616 |title=Commentary upon Sahih Muslim |last=Al-Nawawi |first= |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date= |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160515131517/http://library.islamweb.net/newlibrary/display_book.php?idfrom=4124&amp;idto=4157&amp;bk_no=53&amp;ID=616 |archivedate=May 15, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'Abd al-'Azeez Aal al-Shaykh was asked:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"There is a lot of talk about misyaar marriage being haraam or halaal. We would like a definitive statement about this matter from you, with a description of its conditions and obligations, if it is permissible."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He replied:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The conditions of marriage are that the two partners should be identified and give their consent, and there should be a wali (guardian) and two witnesses. If the conditions are met and the marriage is announced, and they do not agree to conceal it, either the husband, the wife or their guardians, and he offered a waleemah or wedding feast, then this marriage is valid, and you can call it whatever you want after that."&lt;ref&gt;Jareedah al-Jazeerah , Friday 15 Rabee' al-Thaani 1422 AH, issue no. 10508.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


[[Shaykh al-Albani]] was asked about misyar marriage and he forbade it for two reasons:

# That the purpose of marriage is repose as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): "And among His Signs is this, that He created for you wives from among yourselves, that you may find repose in them, and He has put between you affection and mercy. Verily, in that are indeed signs for a people who reflect" [al-Room 30:21]. But this is not achieved in this kind of marriage. 
# It may be decreed that the husband has children with this woman, but because he is far away from her and rarely comes to her, that will be negatively reflected in his children's upbringing and attitude.&lt;ref&gt;Ahkaam al-Ta'addud fi Daw' al-Kitaab wa'l-Sunnah (page 28, 29)&lt;/ref&gt;


[[Muhammad Al-Munajjid|Muhammad Saalih al-Munajjid]] states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"That if Misyaar marriage fulfils the conditions of a valid marriage, namely the proposal and acceptance, the consent of the wali and witnesses or announcement of the marriage, then it is a valid marriage contract, and it is good for some categories of men and women whose circumstances call for this type of marriage. But this may be taken advantage of by some whose religious commitment is weak, hence this permissibility should not be described as general in application in a fatwa, rather the situation of each couple should be examined, and if this kind of marriage is good for them then it should be permitted, otherwise they should not be allowed to do it. That is to prevent marriage for the sake of mere pleasure whilst losing the other benefits of marriage, and to prevent the marriage of two people whose marriage we may be certain is likely to fail and in which the wife will be neglected, such as one who will be away from his wife for many months, and will leave her on her own in an apartment, watching TV and visiting chat rooms and going on the internet. How can such a weak woman spend her time? This is different from one who lives with her family or children and has enough religious commitment, obedience, chastity and modesty to help her be patient during her husband's absence."&lt;ref&gt;https://islamqa.info/en/82390&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although Gogol was considered by his contemporaries to be one of the preeminent figures of the [[natural school]] of [[Russian literature|Russian literary]] [[Realism (arts)|realism]], later critics have found in his work a fundamentally [[Romanticism|romantic]] sensibility, with strains of [[surrealism]] and the [[grotesque]] ("[[The Nose (Gogol)|The Nose]]", "[[Viy (story)|Viy]]", "[[The Overcoat]]", "[[Nevsky Prospekt (story)|Nevsky Prospekt]]"). His early works, such as ''[[Evenings on a Farm Near Dikanka]]'', were influenced by his Ukrainian upbringing, [[Ukrainian culture]] and [[Ukrainian folklore|folklore]].&lt;ref&gt;Ilnytzkyj, Oleh. [https://web.archive.org/web/20130808195933/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3763/is_200709/ai_n21280110/pg_1 "The Nationalism of Nikolai Gogol': Betwixt and Between?"], Canadian Slavonic Papers Sep–Dec 2007. Retrieved 15 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karpuk, Paul A. "Gogol's Research on Ukrainian Customs for the Dikan'ka Tales". ''Russian Review'', Vol. 56, No. 2 (April 1997), pp. 209–232.&lt;/ref&gt; His later writing satirised political corruption in the [[Russian Empire]] (''[[The Government Inspector]]'', ''[[Dead Souls]]''). The novel ''[[Taras Bulba]]'' (1835) and the play ''[[Marriage (play)|Marriage]]'' (1842), along with the short stories "[[Diary of a Madman (story)|Diary of a Madman]]", "[[The Tale of How Ivan Ivanovich Quarreled with Ivan Nikiforovich]]", "[[The Portrait (short story)|The Portrait]]" and "[[The Carriage]]", are also among his best-known works.

==Early life==
Gogol was born in the Ukrainian [[Cossacks|Cossack]] village of [[Velyki Sorochyntsi|Sorochyntsi]],&lt;ref name="brittanica"/&gt; in [[Poltava Governorate]] of the [[Russian Empire]], present-day [[Ukraine]]. His mother descended from Leonty Kosyarovsky, an officer of the [[Lubny Regiment]] in 1710. His father [[Vasily Gogol-Yanovsky]], a descendant of Ukrainian Cossacks (see [[Lyzohub family]]) and who died when Gogol was 15 years old, belonged to the 'petty gentry', wrote poetry in Ukrainian and Russian, and was an amateur [[Ukrainian-language]] playwright. As was typical of the left-bank Ukrainian gentry of the early nineteenth century, the family spoke Ukrainian as well as Russian. As a child, Gogol helped stage Ukrainian-language plays in his uncle's home theater.&lt;ref&gt;Edyta Bojanowska. 2007). ''Nikolai Gogol: Between Ukrainian and Russian Nationalism''. Cambridge Mass: [[Harvard University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1820, Gogol went to a school of higher art in [[Nezhin]] (now [[Nizhyn Gogol State University]]) and remained there until 1828. It was there that he began writing. He was not popular among his schoolmates, who called him their "mysterious dwarf", but with two or three of them he formed lasting friendships. Very early he developed a dark and secretive disposition, marked by a painful self-consciousness and boundless ambition. Equally early he developed a talent for mimicry, which later made him a matchless reader of his own works and induced him to toy with the idea of becoming an actor.

In 1828, on leaving school, Gogol came to [[Saint Petersburg]], full of vague but glowingly ambitious hopes. He had hoped for literary fame, and brought with him a [[Romantic era|Romantic]] poem of German idyllic life – ''Hans Küchelgarten''. He had it published, at his own expense, under the name of "V. Alov." The magazines he sent it to almost universally derided it. He bought all the copies and destroyed them, swearing never to write poetry again.

Gogol was in touch with the "literary aristocracy", had a story published in [[Anton Delvig]]'s ''[[Northern Flowers]]'', was taken up by [[Vasily Zhukovsky]] and [[Pyotr Pletnyov]], and (in 1831) was introduced to [[Alexander Pushkin|Pushkin]].

In 1831 Gogol brought out the first volume of his Ukrainian stories (''[[Evenings on a Farm Near Dikanka]]''), which met with immediate success.&lt;ref&gt;Krys Svitlana, ''“Allusions to Hoffmann in Gogol’s Ukrainian Horror Stories from the Dikan'ka Collection.”'' Canadian Slavonic Papers: Special Issue, devoted to the 200th anniversary of Nikolai Gogol'’s birth (1809–1852) 51.2-3 (June–September 2009): 243-266. (23 pages)&lt;/ref&gt; He followed it in 1832 with a second volume, and in 1835 by two volumes of stories entitled ''[[Mirgorod (Gogol)|Mirgorod]]'', as well as by two volumes of miscellaneous prose entitled ''Arabesques''. At this time Russian editors and critics such as [[Nikolai Polevoy]] and [[Nikolai Nadezhdin]] saw in Gogol the emergence of a Ukrainian, rather than Russian, writer, using his works to illustrate supposed differences between Russian and Ukrainian national characters.&lt;ref name = "Bojanowski"&gt;Edyta M. Bojanowska. (2007). ''Nikolai Gogol: Between Ukrainian and Russian Nationalism.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: [[Harvard University Press]].  pp. 78–88&lt;/ref&gt; The themes and style of these early prose works by Gogol, as well as his later drama, were similar to the work of Ukrainian writers and dramatists who were his contemporaries and friends, including [[Hryhory Kvitka-Osnovyanenko]] and [[Vasily Narezhny]]. However, Gogol's satire was much more sophisticated and unconventional.&lt;ref name="Peace2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Peace|title=The Enigma of Gogol: An Examination of the Writings of N. V.

At this time, Gogol developed a passion for Ukrainian history and tried to obtain an appointment to the history department at [[Kiev University]]. Despite the support of Pushkin and [[Sergey Uvarov]], the Russian minister of education, his appointment was blocked by a [[Kiev|Kyivan]] [[bureaucracy|bureaucrat]] on the grounds that Gogol was unqualified.&lt;ref name="Luckyj"&gt;{{cite book| author=Luckyj, G. | title=The Anguish of Mykola Ghoghol, a.k.a.

Luckyj}}&lt;/ref&gt; His fictional story ''[[Taras Bulba]]'', based on the history of [[Zaporozhian Host|Ukrainian cossacks]], was the result of this phase in his interests. During this time he also developed a close and lifelong friendship with another Ukrainian, the historian and naturalist [[Mykhaylo Maksymovych]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wumag.kiev.ua/index2.php?param=pgs20033/52 |title=Welcome to Ukraine |publisher=Wumag.kiev.ua |date= |accessdate=22 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1834 Gogol was made Professor of Medieval History at the [[University of St. Petersburg]], a job for which he had no qualifications. He turned in a performance ludicrous enough to warrant satiric treatment in one of his own stories. After an introductory lecture made up of brilliant generalizations which the 'historian' had prudently prepared and memorized, he gave up all pretence at erudition and teaching, missed two lectures out of three, and when he did appear, muttered unintelligibly through his teeth. At the final examination, he sat in utter silence with a black handkerchief wrapped around his head, simulating a toothache, while another professor interrogated the students."&lt;ref name="comic-grotesque"&gt;{{cite book| author=Lindstrom, T. | title=A Concise History of Russian Literature Volume I from the Beginnings to Checkhov| location= New York | publisher= [[New York University Press]] | year = 1966 | page = 131|lccn=66-22218}}&lt;/ref&gt; This academic venture proved a failure and he resigned his chair in 1835.

[[Image:Nicolas Gogol.jpg|upright|thumb|Commemorative plaque on his house in Rome]]

Between 1832 and 1836 Gogol worked with great energy, and though almost all his work has in one way or another its sources in these four years of contact with Pushkin, he had not yet decided that his ambitions were to be fulfilled by success in literature. During this time, the Russian critics [[Stepan Shevyryov|Stepan Shevyrev]] and [[Vissarion Belinsky]], contradicting earlier critics, reclassified Gogol from a Ukrainian to a Russian writer.&lt;ref name = "Bojanowski"/&gt; It was only after the presentation at the [[Saint Petersburg]] State Theatre, on 19 April 1836, of his comedy ''[[The Government Inspector]]'' (''Revizor'')&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.act-sf.org/content/dam/act/education_department/words_on_plays/The%20Government%20Inspector%20Words%20on%20Plays%20(2008).pdf|title=The Government Inspector|last=|first=|date=2008|website=American Conservative Theater|publisher=|type=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that he finally came to believe in his literary vocation. The comedy, a violent satire of Russian provincial bureaucracy, was staged thanks only to the intervention of the emperor, [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]].

From 1836 to 1848 Gogol lived abroad, travelling through Germany and Switzerland. Gogol spent the winter of 1836–37 in [[Paris]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fr.rbth.com/art/2013/06/24/le_nom_de_nikolai_gogol_est_immortalise_a_la_place_de_la_bourse_a_paris_24311|title=Le nom de Nikolaï Gogol est immortalisé à la place de la Bourse à Paris|last=RBTH|date=2013-06-24|language=fr-FR|access-date=2016-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; among Russian [[expatriate]]s and Polish [[exile]]s, frequently meeting the Polish poets [[Adam Mickiewicz]] and [[Józef Bohdan Zaleski|Bohdan Zaleski]]. He eventually settled in [[Rome]]. For much of the twelve years from 1836 Gogol was in Italy developing an adoration for Rome. He studied art, read Italian literature and developed a passion for opera. He mingled with Russian and other visitors, and in 1838 met Count Joseph Vielhorskiy, the 23-year-old son of the official who had brought Gogol's ''Government Inspector'' to the attention of the emperor. Vielhorsky was travelling in hopes of curing his tuberculosis. Gogol and Vielhorsky fell in love, a relationship which was soon severed as Vielhorsky died in 1839. Gogol left an account of this time in his ''[[Evenings on a Farm Near Dikanka|Nights at the Villa]]:'' "if my death could restore him to health, with what readiness I would have rushed toward it!"&lt;ref&gt;Simon Karlinsky, ''The Sexual Labyrinth of Nikolai Gogol'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1976) p194&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexander Pushkin|Pushkin]]'s death produced a strong impression on Gogol. His principal work during the years following Pushkin's death was the satirical epic ''Dead Souls''. Concurrently, he worked at other tasks – recast ''[[Taras Bulba]]'' and ''[[The Portrait (short story)|The Portrait]]'', completed his second comedy, ''[[Marriage (play)|Marriage]]'' (''Zhenitba''), wrote the fragment ''[[Rome (Gogol)|Rome]]'' and his most famous short story, "[[The Overcoat]]".

In 1841 the first part of ''[[Dead Souls]]'' was ready, and Gogol took it to Russia to supervise its printing. It appeared in [[Moscow]] in 1842, under the title, imposed by the censorship, of ''The Adventures of Chichikov''. The book instantly established his reputation as the greatest prose writer in the language.

==Creative decline and death==
[[File:Gogol Portrait.jpg|upright|thumb|One of several portraits of Gogol by [[Fyodor Moller]] (1840)]]
After the triumph of ''Dead Souls'', Gogol's contemporaries came to regard him as a great satirist who lampooned the unseemly sides of Imperial Russia. Little did they know that ''Dead Souls'' was but the first part of a planned modern-day counterpart to the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' of [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} The first part represented the ''Inferno''; the second part would depict the gradual purification and transformation of the rogue Chichikov under the influence of virtuous publicans and governors – ''[[Purgatory]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gogol declared that "the subject of ''Dead Souls'' has nothing to do with the description of Russian provincial life or of a few revolting landowners. It is for the time being a secret which must suddenly and to the amazement of everyone (for as yet none of my readers has guessed it) be revealed in the following volumes..."&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1848 Gogol returned to Russia from a pilgrimage to [[Jerusalem]] and passed his last years in restless movement throughout the country. While visiting the capitals, he stayed with friends such as [[Mikhail Pogodin]] and [[Sergey Aksakov]]. During this period, he also spent much time with his old Ukrainian friends, [[Mykhaylo Maksymovych|Maksymovych]] and [[Osyp Bodiansky]].&lt;!--The hilarious detail is out of place in this part of Gogol's biography, which was a continuous nightmare: Describing Gogol's 41st birthday celebration, [[Sergey Aksakov]] wrote that "the three Ukrainians were charming. They sang without the music and Gogol read to me some [[Duma (epic)|dumy]] of the Ukrainian [[Homer]]." --&gt; He intensified his relationship with a [[starets]] or spiritual elder, Matvey Konstantinovsky, whom he had known for several years. Konstantinovsky seems to have strengthened in Gogol the fear of perdition by insisting on the sinfulness of all his imaginative work. Exaggerated ascetic practices undermined his health and he fell into a state of deep depression. On the night of 24 February 1852 he burned some of his manuscripts, which contained most of the second part of ''Dead Souls''. He explained this as a mistake, a practical joke played on him by [[Satan|the Devil]]. Soon thereafter, he took to bed, refused all food, and died in great pain nine days later.

Gogol was mourned in the Saint Tatiana church at the Moscow University before his burial and then buried at the [[Danilov Monastery]], close to his fellow [[Slavophile]] [[Aleksey Khomyakov]]. His grave was marked by a large stone (Golgotha), topped by a Russian Orthodox cross.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsru.com/cinema/29dec2009/gogole.html Могиле Гоголя вернули первозданный вид: на нее поставили "Голгофу" с могилы Булгакова и восстановили крест.]{{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931, Moscow authorities decided to demolish the monastery and had Gogol's remains transferred to the [[Novodevichy Cemetery]].&lt;ref name=pass&gt;{{cite news|title=Novodevichy Cemetery|url=http://www.passportmagazine.ru/article/1099/|accessdate=12 September 2013|work=Passport Magazine|date=April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Николај Гогољ, Гробље Новодевичје.jpg|thumb|right|Gogol's grave at the [[Novodevichy Cemetery]]]]
[[File:Post-2009 gravesite of Nikolai Gogol in Novodevichy Cemetery, Moscow, Russia.jpg|thumb|Post-2009 gravesite of Nikolai Gogol in Novodevichy Cemetery, Moscow, Russia]]

His body was discovered lying face down, which gave rise to the story that Gogol had been buried alive. The authorities moved the Golgotha stone to the new gravesite, but removed the cross; in 1952 the Soviets replaced the stone with a bust of Gogol. The stone was later reused for the tomb of Gogol's admirer [[Mikhail Bulgakov]].  In 2009, in connection with the bicentennial of Gogol's birth, the bust was moved{{by whom|date=July 2014}} to the museum at Novodevichy Cemetery, and the original Golgotha stone was returned, along with a copy of the original Orthodox cross.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsru.com/cinema/29dec2009/gogole.html Могиле Гоголя вернули первозданный вид: на нее поставили "Голгофу" с могилы Булгакова и восстановили крест.]{{ru icon}} Retrieved 23 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Gogol monument in Moscow, a [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] statue on [[Arbatskaya Square|Arbat Square]], represented the sculptor [[Nikolay Andreyev]]'s idea of Gogol rather than the real man.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artclassic.edu.ru/attach.asp?a_no=9444 Российское образование.

[[Joseph Stalin]] did not like it, however, and the statue was replaced by a more orthodox [[Socialist Realism]] monument in 1952. It took enormous efforts to save Andreyev's original work from destruction; {{as of | 2014 | lc = on}} it stands in front of the house where Gogol died.&lt;ref&gt;For a full story and illustrations, see [http://artclassic.edu.ru/cross_search.asp?s1=1851&amp;f1=1875&amp;s2=1876&amp;f2=1900&amp;s3=1901&amp;f3=1925&amp;pg=8 Российское образование.

==Style==
[[Image:Korobochka.jpg|thumb|Among the illustrators of ''Dead Souls'' was [[Pyotr Sokolov (painter)|Pyotr Sokolov]].]]
[[D. S. Mirsky]] characterized Gogol's universe as "one of the most marvellous, unexpected – in the strictest sense, original&lt;ref&gt;Gogol's originality does not mean that numerous influences cannot be discerned in his work. The principle of these are: the tradition of the Ukrainian folk and [[puppet theatre]], with which the plays of Gogol's father were closely linked; the heroic poetry of the Cossack ballads (''[[Duma (epic)|dumy]]''), the ''[[Iliad]]'' in the Russian version by [[Nikolay Gnedich|Gnedich]]; the numerous and mixed traditions of comic writing from [[Molière]] to the vaudevillians of the 1820s; the [[picaresque novel]] from [[Alain-René Lesage|Lesage]] to [[Vasily Narezhny|Narezhny]]; [[Laurence Sterne|Sterne]], chiefly through the medium of German romanticism; the German romanticists themselves (especially [[Ludwig Tieck|Tieck]] and [[E.T.A. Hoffmann]]); the French tradition of [[Gothic romance]] – a long and yet incomplete list.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; – worlds ever created by an artist of words".&lt;ref&gt;[[D.S. Mirsky]]. ''A History of Russian Literature''. [[Northwestern University Press]], 1999. {{ISBN|0-8101-1679-0}}. p.155.&lt;/ref&gt;

The other main characteristic of Gogol's writing is his 'impressionist' vision of reality and people.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} He saw the outer world romantically metamorphosed, a singular gift particularly evident from the fantastic spatial transformations in his Gothic stories, "[[A Terrible Vengeance]]" and "[[A Bewitched Place]]". His pictures of nature are strange mounds of detail heaped on detail, resulting in an unconnected chaos of things. His people are caricatures, drawn with the method of the caricaturist – which is to exaggerate salient features and to reduce them to geometrical pattern. But these cartoons have a convincingness, a truthfulness, and inevitability – attained as a rule by slight but definitive strokes of unexpected reality – that seems to beggar the visible world itself.&lt;ref&gt;Mirsky, p.149&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=June 2015}}

The aspect under which the mature Gogol sees reality is expressed by the Russian word ''[[poshlost']]'', which means something similar to "triviality, banality, inferiority", moral and spiritual, widespread in some group or society. Like [[Laurence Sterne|Sterne]] before him, Gogol was a great destroyer of prohibitions and of romantic illusions. He undermined Russian Romanticism by making vulgarity reign where only the sublime and the beautiful had reigned.&lt;ref&gt;
According to some critics{{which|date=June 2015}}, Gogol's grotesque is a "means of estranging, a comic hyperbole that unmasks the banality and inhumanity of ambient reality". See: Fusso, Susanne. ''Essays on Gogol: Logos and the Russian Word''. Northwestern University Press, 1994. {{ISBN|0-8101-1191-8}}. p.55.&lt;/ref&gt; "Characteristic of Gogol is a sense of boundless superfluity that is soon revealed as utter emptiness and a rich comedy that suddenly turns into metaphysical horror."&lt;ref&gt;"Russian literature." [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], 2005.
&lt;/ref&gt;
His stories often interweave pathos and mockery, while "[[The Tale of How Ivan Ivanovich Quarreled with Ivan Nikiforovich]]" begins as a merry farce and ends with the famous dictum, "It is dull in this world, gentlemen!"

It stunned Gogol when many{{quantify|date=April 2017}} interpreted ''[[The Government Inspector]]'' as an indictment of [[tsarism]] despite Nicholas I's patronage of the play. Gogol himself, an adherent of the [[Slavophile]] movement, believed in a divinely inspired mission for both the [[House of Romanov]] and the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. Similar to [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], Gogol sharply disagreed with those Russians who preached [[constitutional monarchy]] and the disestablishment of the Orthodox Church.

After defending [[autocracy]], [[serfdom]], and the Orthodox Church in his book ''Selected Passages from Correspondence with his Friends'' (1847), Gogol came under attack from his former patron [[Vissarion Belinsky]]. The first Russian intellectual to publicly preach the economic theories of [[Karl Marx]], Belinsky accused Gogol of betraying his readership by defending the ''status quo''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/subject/art/lit_crit/works/belinsky/gogol.htm |title=Letter to N.V. Gogol |publisher=marxists.org |date=February 2008 |accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence and interpretations==
Even before the publication of ''Dead Souls'', Belinsky recognized Gogol as the first realist writer in the language and the head of the [[Natural School]], to which he also assigned such younger or lesser authors as [[Ivan Goncharov|Goncharov]], [[Ivan Turgenev|Turgenev]], [[Dmitry Grigorovich]], [[Vladimir Dahl]] and [[Vladimir Sollogub]]. Gogol himself seemed to be skeptical about the existence of such a literary movement. Although he recognized "several young writers" who "have shown a particular desire to observe real life", he upbraided the deficient composition and style of their works.&lt;ref&gt;''"The structure of the stories themselves seemed especially unskilful and clumsy to me; in one story I noted excess and verbosity, and an absence of simplicity in the style"''. Quoted by Vasily Gippius in his monograph ''Gogol'' ([[Duke University Press]], 1989, page 166).&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, subsequent generations of radical critics celebrated Gogol (the author in whose world a nose roams the streets of the Russian capital) as a great realist, a reputation decried by the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' as "the triumph of Gogolesque irony".&lt;ref&gt;The latest edition of the Britannica labels Gogol "one of the finest comic authors of world literature and perhaps its most accomplished [[nonsense]] writer." See under "Russian literature."&lt;/ref&gt;

The period of [[modernism]] saw a revival of interest in and a change of attitude towards Gogol's work. One of the pioneering works of [[Russian formalism]] was [[Boris Eichenbaum|Eichenbaum]]'s reappraisal of "The Overcoat". In the 1920s, a group of Russian short story writers, known as the [[Serapion Brothers]], placed Gogol among their precursors and consciously sought to imitate his techniques. The leading novelists of the period – notably [[Yevgeny Zamyatin]] and [[Mikhail Bulgakov]] – also admired Gogol and followed in his footsteps. In 1926, [[Vsevolod Meyerhold]] staged ''[[The Government Inspector]]'' as a "comedy of the absurd situation", revealing to his fascinated spectators a corrupt world of endless self-deception. In 1934, [[Andrei Bely]] published the most meticulous study of Gogol's literary techniques up to that date, in which he analyzed the colours prevalent in Gogol's work depending on the period, his impressionistic use of verbs, expressive discontinuity of his syntax, complicated rhythmical patterns of his sentences, and many other secrets of his craft. Based on this work, [[Vladimir Vladimirovich Nabokov|Vladimir Nabokov]] published a summary account of Gogol's masterpieces in 1944.
[[Image:Gogol house.jpg|thumb|right|The house in Moscow where Gogol died. The building contains the fireplace where he burned the manuscript of the second part of ''[[Dead Souls]]''.]]

Gogol's impact on Russian literature has been enduring, yet his works have been appreciated differently by various critics. [[Vissarion Belinsky|Belinsky]], for instance, berated his horror stories as "moribund, monstrous works", while [[Andrei Bely]] counted them among his most stylistically daring creations. Nabokov especially admired ''Dead Souls'', ''The Government Inspector'', and "[[The Overcoat]]" as works of genius, proclaiming that "when, as in his immortal 'The Overcoat', Gogol really let himself go and pottered happily on the brink of his private abyss, he became the greatest artist that Russia has yet produced."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nabokov|first=Vladimir|title=Nikolai Gogol|year=1961|publisher=New Directions|location=New York|isbn=0-8112-0120-1|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The Overcoat" was traditionally interpreted as a masterpiece of "humanitarian realism", but Nabokov and some other attentive readers argued that "holes in the language" make the story susceptible to interpretation as a supernatural tale about a ghostly double of a "small man".&lt;ref&gt;At least this reading of the story seems to have been on Dostoevsky's mind when he wrote ''[[The Double: A Petersburg Poem|The Double]]''. The quote, often apocryphally attributed to him, that "we all [future generations of Russian novelists] emerged from Gogol's ''Overcoat''", actually refers to those few who read "The Overcoat" as a double-bottom ghost story (as did [[Aleksey Remizov]], judging by his story ''The Sacrifice'').&lt;/ref&gt; Of all Gogol's stories, [[The Nose (Gogol)|"The Nose"]] has stubbornly defied all abstruse interpretations: [[D.S. Mirsky]] declared it "a piece of sheer play, almost sheer nonsense".

Gogol's oeuvre has also had a large impact on Russia's non-literary culture, and his stories have been [[Bibliography of Nikolai Gogol#Adaptations|adapted numerous times]] into opera and film. Russian Composer [[Alfred Schnittke]] wrote the eight part ''Gogol Suite'' as [[incidental music]] to ''[[The Government Inspector#Other adaptations|The Government Inspector]]'' performed as a [[Play (theater)|play]], and composer [[Dmitri Shostakovich]] set ''[[The Nose (Gogol)|"]]''[[The Nose (Gogol)|The Nose]]''"'' as his first opera in 1930, despite the peculiar choice of subject for what was meant to initiate the great tradition of Soviet opera.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cduniverse.com/search/xx/music/pid/1045867/a/Schnittke:+Gogol+Suite,+Labyrinths+%2F+Lev+Markiz,+Malm%F6+Sym.htm Gogol Suite], CD Universe&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently, to celebrate the 200th anniversary of Gogol's birth, Vienna's renowned [[Theater an der Wien]] commissioned music and libretto for a full-length opera on the life of Gogol from Russian composer and writer [[Lera Auerbach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wien.orf.at/stories/262439/|title=Zwei Kompositionsaufträge vergeben|trans-title=Two Compositions Commissioned|language=de|work=wien.orf.at|deadurl=unfit|archiveurl=https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwayback.archive.org%2Fweb%2F20110725175353%2Fhttp%3A%2F%2Fwien.orf.at%2Fstories%2F262439%2F|archivedate=25 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some attention has also been given to the apparent [[anti-Semitism]] in Gogol's writings, as well as those of his contemporary, [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Vladim Joseph Rossman, Vadim Rossman, Vidal Sassoon. ''Russian Intellectual Antisemitism in the Post-Communist Era.'' p. 64. [[University of Nebraska Press]].

Gogol painted him as supremely exploitative, cowardly, and repulsive, albeit capable of gratitude. But it seems perfectly natural in the story that he and his cohorts be drowned in the Dniper by the Cossack lords. Above all, Yankel is ridiculous, and the image of the plucked chicken that Gogol used has made the rounds of great Russian authors."&lt;ref&gt;Leon Poliakov. ''The History of Antisemitism.'' p. 75. [[University of Pennsylvania Press]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=94H61cGGGQ8C&amp;pg=PA75&amp;lpg=PA75&amp;dq=Nikolai+Gogol+and+anti-Semitism&amp;source=web&amp;ots=QZrpeuCWhi&amp;sig=KDrHHQSbL8YYlbINJ30bWDxp6wM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result Google.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his problematic portrayal of Jewish characters, Gogol left a powerful impression even on Jewish writers who inherited his literary legacy. Amelia Glaser has noted the influence of Gogol's literary innovations on [[Sholem Aleichem]], who "chose to model much of his writing, and even his appearance, on Gogol... What Sholem Aleichem was borrowing from Gogol was a rural East European landscape that may have been dangerous, but could unite readers through the power of collective memory. He also learned from Gogol to soften this danger through laughter, and he often rewrites Gogol's Jewish characters, correcting anti-Semitic stereotypes and narrating history from a Jewish perspective."&lt;ref&gt;Amelia Glaser.

Gogol's short story "Christmas Eve"  was adapted into operatic form twice by [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]], first as ''[[Vakula the Smith]]'' in 1874, then as ''[[Cherevichki|The Tsarina's Slippers]]'' in 1885; [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]] also wrote [[Christmas Eve (opera)|an opera based on the same story]] in 1894. The story was also adapted for radio by [[Adam Beeson]] and broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on 24 December 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00g3cfq |title=Christmas Eve |publisher=BBC Radio 4 |date=24 December 2008 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090110204616/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00g3cfq |archivedate=10 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently rebroadcast on both Radio 4 and [[BBC Radio 4 Extra|Radio 4 Extra]] on Christmas Eve 2010, 2011 and 2015;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Nikolai |last=Gogol |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00wsymb |title=Nikolai Gogol - Christmas Eve |publisher=BBC Radio 4 Extra |date=24 December 2015 |accessdate=24 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gogol's story "Viy"  was adapted into film by Russian filmmakers four times: the original ''[[Viy (1967 film)|Viy]]'' in 1967; the horror film ''Vedma'' (aka ''The Power of Fear'') in 2006; the action-horror film ''[[Viy (2014 film)|Viy]]'' in 2014; and the horror film ''Gogol Viy'' released in 2018. It was also adapted into the Russian [[Full motion video|FMV]] video game ''Viy: The Story Retold'' (2004). Outside of Russia, the film loosely served as the inspiration for [[Mario Bava]]'s film ''[[Black Sunday (1960 film)|Black Sunday]]'' (1960) and the South Korean horror film ''Evil Spirit: Viy'' (2008).

Gogol's short story "The Portrait" is being made into a feature film ''[[The Portrait (film)|The Portrait]]'' by fine artists Anastasia Elena Baranoff and Elena Vladimir Baranoff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screendaily.com/news/patrick-cassavetti-boards-lenin/5073427.article|title=Patrick Cassavetti boards Lenin?!|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.russianartandculture.com/news-gogols-short-story-the-portrait-to-be-made-into-feature-film/|title=NEWS: Gogol's short story The Portrait to be made into feature film|publisher=russianartandculture.com|date=4 July 2014|accessdate=24 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Screen International [http://www.screendaily.com/festivals/berlin/david-oakes-simon-callow-to-star-in-russian-period-drama-the-portrait/5100200.article],  Berlin Film Festival, 12 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Russian Art and Culture [http://www.russianartandculture.com/news-gogols-the-portrait-adapted-for-the-screen-by-an-international-team-of-talents/ “Gogol’s “The Portrait” adapted for the screen by an international team of talents”], London, 29 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kinodata.Pro [http://kinodata.pro/vse-o-kino/novosti-rus-kino/11597-zvezda-doma-solnca-sygraet-v-ekranizacii-rasskaza-gogolya-portret.html] Russia, 12 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Britshow.com [http://britshow.com/index.php/russian-news/1938-britantsy-snimutsya-v-ekranizatsii-gogolya] 16 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian TV-3 television series ''Gogol'' features Nikolai Gogol as a lead character and presents a fictionalized version of his life that mixes his history with elements from his various stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2017/09/05/732340-serial-o-gogole|publisher=[[Vedomosti]]|title=Сериал о Гоголе собрал за первые выходные в четыре раза больше своего бюджета}}&lt;/ref&gt; The episodes were also released theatrically starting with ''[[Gogol. The Beginning]]'' in August 2017. A sequel entitled ''[[Gogol. Viy|Gogol: Viy]]'' was released in April 2018 and the third film ''[[Gogol. Terrible Revenge|Gogol: Terrible Revenge]]'' debuted in August 2018.

==Legacy==
Gogol has been featured many times on Russian and Soviet postage stamps; he is also well represented on stamps worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marka-art.ru/catalogs/StampSeries.jsp?id=11543433|title=ru:200 лет со дня рождения Н.В.Гоголя (1809-1852), писателя|trans-title=200 years since the birth of Nikolai Gogol (1809-1852), writer|language=ru|publisher=marka-art.ru|date=1 April 2009|accessdate=3 April 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090322092541/http://www.marka-art.ru/catalogs/StampSeries.jsp?id=11543433|archivedate=22 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kraspost.ru/node/1357|script-title=ru:К 200-летию со дня рождения Н.

In 2009, the [[National Bank of Ukraine]] issued a [[List of commemorative coins of Ukraine|commemorative coin]] dedicated to Gogol.&lt;ref&gt;[http://photo.unian.net/eng/themes/11966 Events by themes: NBU presented an anniversary coin «Nikolay Gogol» from series "Personages of Ukraine"], [[UNIAN]]-photo service (19 March 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Streets have been named after Gogol in various towns, including Moscow, Sofia, [[Lipetsk]], [[Odessa]], [[Myrhorod]], [[Krasnodar]], [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]], [[Vladivostok]], [[Penza]], [[Petrozavodsk]], [[Riga]], [[Bratislava]], Belgrade, [[Harbin]] and many other towns and cities.

Gogol is mentioned several times in [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]'s ''[[Poor Folk]]'' and ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'' and [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov]]'s ''[[The Seagull]]''. More than 135 films&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0324690/?ref_=ttfc_fc_wr3|title=Nikolai Gogol|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been based on Gogol's work, the most recent being ''[[The Girl in the White Coat]]'' (2011).

The main character in [[Jhumpa Lahiri]]'s 2003 novel ''[[The Namesake]]'' and its 2006 [[The Namesake (film)|movie]] is named after Nikolai Gogol, because his father survives a train crash while clutching onto a copy of one of Gogol's books in his hand.

An eponymous poem "Gogol" by the [[poet-diplomat]] [[Abhay K]] refers to some of the great works of Gogol such as "[[The Nose (Gogol)|The Nose]]", "[[The Overcoat]]", "[[Nevsky Prospekt (story)|Nevsky Prospekt]]", ''[[Dead Souls]]'' and ''[[The Government Inspector]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://pratilipi.in/2013/01/abhay-k-poems/|title=Possessed Idiots and Deadly Demons: Abhay K|journal=Pratilipi: A Bilingual Literary Journal|publisher=pratilipi.in|date=December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222150123/http://pratilipi.in/2013/01/abhay-k-poems/|archivedate=22 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15840">[[Religions]] are represented in the [[Internet]] in many ways. There are sites which attempt to cover all religions, traditions, and faiths, such as [[Patheos]] (which also provides a forum for atheism/humanism), [[Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance|Religious Tolerance]], and [[Beliefnet]], in addition to sites that are specific to a religious tradition. Many sites are discussion groups, others [[theological]] debates and some attempt to provide advice concerning religious [[doctrine]]. There are also sites that aim to provide a religious experience facilitating [[prayer]], [[meditation]], or [[Virtuality|virtual]] [[pilgrimages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | date=April 18, 2002| title=Religion and the Internet | work=MIT Communications Forum | url=http://web.mit.edu/comm-forum/forums/religion.html | accessdate=2006-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | date=Aug 24, 1999| title= Web Sites Provide Foundation for Understanding Religion | work=University of Virginia | url=http://www.virginia.edu/topnews/releases/religion-aug-24-1999.html | accessdate=2006-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-15548584_ITM|title=Religion and the internet. |publisher= Communication Research Trends (March 2006)|accessdate=2007-12-28 | date=2006-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; People also leverage search engines to investigate aspects of religion.&lt;ref&gt;Jansen, B.

==Christianity==
There have been a number of attempts to create online Christian communities, usually supplementing, but occasionally attempting to replace, more traditional, brick and mortar Christian communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/daily/april99/religionweb10.htm|title=Religion on the Web
|work=Washington Post|accessdate=2008-02-27|last=|first=| date=1999-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is common for even moderate sized [[Christian]] churches with only a few hundred members to have web sites to advertise themselves and communicate with their congregations. For example, Scott Thumma, a faculty associate at the Hartford Institute for Religion Research found that in the [[United States|U.S.]] between 1998 and 2002, the ratio of churches with web sites went from 11 percent to 45 percent. Most sites concentrate on teaching and discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= Larsen, Elena | date=December 23, 2001| title= Internet resources are aids for the deeply devout | format=| work= Pew Internet | url=http://www.pewinternet.org/PPF/r/36/press_release.asp | accessdate=2006-08-05 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060624091149/http://www.pewinternet.org/PPF/r/36/press_release.asp |archivedate = June 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some experiment with virtual meetings in cyberspace, and attempt to incorporate teaching, prayer, worship and even music into the experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author= Wilson, Giles| title= In cyberspace, can anyone hear you pray? | format=| work= BBC News Online Magazine | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/3706897.stm | accessdate=2006-08-05 | date=2004-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=  Larmondin, Leanne | date=February 1, 2000| title= Attending a virtual church becoming easier | format=| work= Anglican Journal | url=http://www.anglicanjournal.com/opinion/news/article/attending-a-virtual-church-becoming-easier/| archive-url=https://archive.is/20080821111028/http://www.anglicanjournal.com/opinion/news/article/attending-a-virtual-church-becoming-easier/| dead-url=yes| archive-date=August 21, 2008|accessdate=2006-08-05}} &lt;/ref&gt; The i-church is the first Internet community to be fully recognised as an [[Anglican church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author= | title= Church plans parish in cyberspace | format=| work= BBC News | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3534017.stm | accessdate=2006-08-05 | date=2004-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author= | title= First web-pastor appointed | format=| work= BBC News | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/3704205.stm | accessdate=2006-08-05 | date=2004-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being reassigned to the [[sinecure]] [[diocese]] of [[Partenia]] (a major [[Algeria]]n city, that was consumed by the [[Sahara]] in the 5th century) by [[Pope John Paul II]] in 1995 as punishment for his controversial views, Roman Catholic Bishop [[Jacques Gaillot]] set up a website for the "diocese without borders."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= Spar, Debora | date=September 24, 2004| title= Why the Internet Doesn't Change Everything | work= Harvard Business School | url=http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/2515.html | accessdate=2006-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hinduism==
There are various web sites that aim to cover all of the [[Hindu]] religious traditions, including for example the Hindu Universe, which is maintained by the [[Hindu Studies]] Council. The site includes Hindu scripture and commentaries of the [[Rig Veda]], [[Upanishads]], the [[Bhagvad Gita]] and the laws of [[Manusmṛti|Manu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=| date=October 3, 2000| title=The Hindu Universe| format=| work=Humbul Humanities Hub, University of Oxford| url=http://www.humbul.ac.uk/output/full5.php?id=455&amp;sub=religion&amp;ref=byheading&amp;code=DD.52| accessdate=2006-08-06}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, there are a large number of web sites devoted to specific aspects of the Hindu tradition. For example, the major epics, the [[Mahabharata]] and the [[Ramayana]], have web sites devoted to their study. There is a site devoted to the [[Kumbh Mela]] pilgrimage, giving Internet users the opportunity to join the hundreds of thousands of pilgrims who gather in [[Allahabad]] to bathe in the [[Ganges]]. Sites like Saranam.com allow worshippers to order a [[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]] at the [[Hindu temple]] of their choosing and many pages have image of [[Hindu deities|deities]], which are thought to convey [[Darśana|Darshan]] in the same manner as temple figures. The followers of [[Sri Vaishnava]], [[Swaminarayan Sampraday]] and [[Dvaita Vedanta]] have web sites, and the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]], also known as the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishnas]], have their own site, which includes a Hare Krishna Network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=  | date= January 3, 2001| title= Hinduism Online  | format=| work= Asia Source | url=http://www.asiasource.org/news/at_mp_02.cfm?newsid=39841 | accessdate=2006-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=  | year=| title= Hinduism Internet Resources  | work= Saint Joseph's University | url=http://www.sju.edu/cas/theology/Courses/2141/resources.htm | accessdate=2006-08-06 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050210230137/http://www.sju.edu/cas/theology/Courses/2141/resources.htm |archivedate = February 10, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Temples now webcast [[Darśana|darshan]] live on the internet. In fact, important events too are broadcast live on the internet. For example, the [[Shri Swaminarayan Mandir Cardiff|Swaminarayan Temple]] in [[Cardiff]] broadcast its 25th anniversary celebrations live on the internet in 2007.&lt;ref name = "BBC"&gt;{{cite news | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/nolpda/ukfs_news/hi/newsid_7006000/7006249.stm | title= Worshippers celebrate with parade | work=BBC News | date=2007-09-22 | accessdate=2010-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islam==

Islamic sites fulfill a number of distinct roles, such as providing advice concerning religious doctrine, download daily prayers and for taking the [[shahadah]] over the Internet. For example, the Islam Page is a comprehensive Islamic web site, which links to a complete version of the [[Quran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | author= Jaeger, John  | date= June 2002  | title= World religions on the Web  | work= American Library Association  | url= http://www.ala.org/ala/acrl/acrlpubs/crlnews/backissues2002/june/worldreligions.htm  | accessdate= 2006-08-06  | deadurl= yes  | archiveurl= https://archive.is/20130903023241/http://web.archive.org/web/20040203143353/http://www.ala.org/ala/acrl/acrlpubs/crlnews/backissues2002/june/worldreligions.htm  | archivedate= 2013-09-03  | df=   }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sites such as the Islam-Online site, according to Gary Bunt of the [[University of Wales]], provide information about Islamic doctrine in addition to advice concerning individual problems including marriage, worship and Internet use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= Bunt, Gary | date=May 9, 2006| title= Virtually Islamic | format=| work=  | url=http://www.virtuallyislamic.com/|accessdate=2006-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to answer online questions, an [[Imam]] or a team of religious scholars frequently provide a [[fatwa]]. These are stored in databases, which allow online users to search for their specific query. Gary Bunt has commented this has the advantage of facilitating resolution to issues that are considered dangerous or embarrassing to raise within the domestic framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author= Whitaker, Brian| title= Islam at the electronic frontier| work= The Guardian | url=http://technology.guardian.co.uk/online/comment/story/0,12449,1016429,00.html | accessdate=2006-08-05 | location=London | date=2003-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism==

Several websites and blogs cover Judaism and Jewish life on the web. Some websites argue a certain religious or political viewpoint, while some take a purely cultural or secular focus. Conservative, [[Modern Orthodox]], post-denominational, Reform, secular, and [[Haredi]] Jews are involved in writing [[J-blogs]]. Some J-bloggers, although religious in practice, use their blogs to discuss theological views which are skeptical or nonconformist. J-blogs fall into radical, liberal and conservative camps with respect to all Jewish communities across the world. Several blogs, such as [[CampusJ]] and [[Jewschool]], cover Jewish life on campus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/29997/format/html/displaystory.html J Weekly Magazine of Northern California] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926033341/http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/29997/format/html/displaystory.html |date=September 26, 2008 }}, "Local Jewish blog attempts to unite community", Amanda Ogus (Summer 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishlife.org/pdf/spring_2006.pdf Contact Magazine] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619003801/http://www.jewishlife.org/pdf/spring_2006.pdf |date=June 19, 2006 }}, "The Internet: Pathways and Possibilities", Various Authors (Spring 2006) - Adobe PDF Format&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jta.org/page_view_story.asp?intarticleid=16589&amp;intcategoryid=4 JTA article] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208093121/http://www.jta.org/page_view_story.asp?intarticleid=16589&amp;intcategoryid=4 |date=December 8, 2006 }}, "From Internet pals to real friends, blogs remaking Jewish community", Sue Fishkoff (May 8, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vodou ==
The Internet has "shipped" [[Haitian Vodou|Vodou]] via cyberspace, increasing it's accessibility outside of a Haitian context as there is no central text to be shared.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Boutros|first = Alexandra|date = November 2002|title = Virtual Vodou: The Technologies of Faith in the Domains of Cyberspirituality|journal = Carleton University Europe-Russia Conference Series|doi =|pmid =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexandra Boutros explains that while Vodou was formerly secret, it is now public, widespread, and available for consumption by any through the cyber world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Her concern is that the shipping of Vodou has led Internet, much like popular culture, to be full of "voodoo that is not Vodou."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; "Voodoo" is a spelling used to denote tropes of Vodou, the Haitian tradition, which perpetuate misunderstandings, lies, and stereotypes. As such, Boutros explains that online Vodou, as well as cyberspirituality in general, are not representations of "real religions in real places," but instead are their own "dynamic entity," and this is an important distinction to make when studying Vodou or any other religion and its online presence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==New religious movements==
Many [[new religious movements]] have websites. A website of the [[Church of Scientology]], for example, allows visitors to take an online [[personality test]] (the [[Oxford Capacity Analysis]]); however, to review the full results of this test, one has to make an appointment to meet a church representative in person. There has also been a series of legal battles—sometimes referred to as [[Scientology versus the Internet]]—concerning the publishing of esoteric teachings such as the "[[Space opera in Scientology|space opera]]" and, more specifically, [[Xenu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author= Ryan, Nicholas| title= The Gospel of the Web | work= The Guardian | url=https://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,3977131,00.html| accessdate=2006-08-05 | location=London | date=2000-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Stephen O'Leary of the [[University of Southern California]], the [[Falun Gong]]'s Internet awareness was an important factor in its ability to organize unauthorized demonstrations in the [[People's Republic of China]]. The group's leader, [[Li Hongzhi]], was able to use the Internet to coordinate the movement, although he currently lives in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= O'Leary, Stephen | date=June 15, 2000| title= Falun Gong and the Internet | format=| work= University of Southern California | url=http://www.ojr.org/ojr/ethics/1017964337.php| accessdate=2006-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various religious movements that have used the Internet extensively and this has been studied by academics, in the field of [[sociology of religion]]. Examples cited by [[Adam Possamai]], of the [[University of Western Sydney]], include [[Jediism]] and [[Matrixism]]. Possamai uses the term 'hyper-real religion' to describe these religions mixed with [[popular culture]], arguing that they are part of the consumer logic of [[late capitalism]] and are enhanced by the growing use of the internet.&lt;ref name="R&amp;PC"&gt;[[Adam Possamai|Possamai]], Adam (2005).

[[Christianity]] is the main '''religion in South America''', with [[Roman Catholic]]s having the most adherents. Sizeable minorities of non-religious people and adherents of other religions are also present.

== Religious freedom ==
Currently, all countries in the region in general are separate of the Catholic Church and declared laic states, which guarantees freedom of religion for its inhabitants. The last country to approve the freedom of religion was [[Bolivia]] (since 2008).

== Christianity ==
[[File:Basilica of the National Shrine of Our Lady of Aparecida, 2007.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Basilica of the National Shrine of Our Lady of Aparecida]] is the second largest in the world, after only of the [[Basilica of Saint Peter]] in [[Vatican City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noticias.terra.com.br/brasil/interna/0,,OI1984236-EI306,00.html|title=Basílica de Aparecida aguarda 160 mil pessoas|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
According to the [[Association of Religion Data Archives]] 91.9% of the South American population is [[Christian]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thearda.com/internationalData/regions/profiles/Region_17_1.asp ''Largest Religious Groups (South America).''] The [[Association of Religion Data Archives]] (ARDA)&lt;/ref&gt; although less than half of them are praticant.

=== Catholicism ===
Except for Suriname and Uruguay, the more professed religion in the South American countries is the [[Catholic religion]]. While countries such as [[Paraguay]], [[Peru]], [[Colombia]] and [[Argentina]] more than three-quarters of the population is Catholic, in Chile it is 57%.

[[Catholicism]] was the only religion allowed in the [[colonial era]]; the indigenous were forced to abandon their beliefs, although many did not abandon it at all, for example, countries with predominantly [[Amerindians|Amerindian population]] such as [[Bolivia]] and [[Peru]] there is a syncretism between [[indigenous religions]] and the Catholic religion, that has occurred since colonial times. In [[Brazil]] or [[Colombia]], Catholicism was mixed with certain [[African religion|African rituals]].

=== Protestantism ===
[[Protestantism]] has been a presence since the nineteenth century, as a minority, but has had a strong increase since the 1980s. The majority of Latin American Protestants in general are [[Pentecostals]].&lt;ref name="Luis Palau"/&gt; [[Brazil]] today is the most evangelical country in South America, where 89% of Brazilians evangelicals are Pentecostals, in [[Chile]] represents 79% of the total evangelicals in that country, 69% in [[Argentina]] and 59% in [[Colombia]].&lt;ref name="Luis Palau"&gt;«Luis Palau: Evangelist to Three Worlds», Christianity Today, 20 de mayo de 1983, pp. 30-1. Luis Palau, «The Gospel's Social Impact», Briefing (Portland, Oregon: Cruzada Luis Palau), verano de 1984, pp. 14-16.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other part, in [[Uruguay]] 66% of evangelicals are [[Methodists]], while only 20% are Pentecostal.&lt;ref name="Luis Palau"/&gt;

=== Spiritism ===
[[Brazil]] is the country with more practitioners in the world of [[Allan Kardec]]'s codification of the [[Spiritism]], followed by over 12 million people, with 30 to 45 million sympathizers. Most followers of the [[Spiritism]] are highly educated people that were mostly Catholic, Protests and Atheists respectively. Despite the Spiritism does not recognize Jesus as God or the only son of God, but as the most illuminated spirit that were born on Earth, the [[Spiritism]] is also considered as Christian religion, in addition to science and philosophy, as [[The Spirits Book|''The Spirits Book'']] explain it, at its 1019 questions and answers. The [[Spiritist Codification|basic books of the codification]] includes [[The Spirits Book]], [[The Book on Mediums]], [[The Gospel According to Spiritism]], [[Heaven and Hell (Allan Kardec)|Heaven and Hell]] and [[The Genesis According to Spiritism]]. 

[[Chico Xavier]] wrote over 490 books, which complements the [[Spiritism|spiritualist doctrine]].

=== Eastern Orthodoxy ===
[[Eastern Orthodox Christianity]] was brought to South America by groups of immigrants from several different regions, mainly [[Eastern Europe]] and the [[Middle East]]. This traditional branch of Eastern Christianity has also spread beyond the boundaries of immigrant communities. There are several Eastern Orthodox ecclesiastical jurisdictions in South America, organized within the Assembly of Canonical Orthodox Bishops of Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://oca.org/directories/organizations/assembly-of-canonical-orthodox-bishops-of-latin-america|title=Organizations - Assembly of Canonical Orthodox Bishops of Latin America|website=oca.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oriental Orthodoxy===
Several groups of Christian immigrants, mainly from the [[Middle East]], [[Caucasus]], [[Africa]] and [[India]], brought [[Oriental Orthodoxy]] to the South America. This ancient branch of Eastern Christianity includes several ecclesiastical jurisdictions in the South America, like [[Coptic Orthodox Church in South America]] and [[Syriac Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://syriacpatriarchate.org/2016/10/meeting-with-the-president-of-brazil|title=Meeting with the President of Brazil|date=27 October 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other Christian ===
Practitioners of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] religions also are exercised in Latin America.

== Non-Christian religions ==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3327">'''Three Levels Movement''', the '''Sanjiejiao''' (三階教) or '''Pufazong''' (普法宗) is a popular religious movement based on the teachings of the [[Chinese Chán]] monk teacher Xinxing (信行禪師)(540-594).

==Teachings==
Xinxing taught that in the stage of [[mappo|mofa]] Buddhists must learn all Buddhist teachings (Pufa). He taught [[Tapas (Sanskrit)|tapas]], begging for food, eating only one meal daily, worshiping all living things as Buddhas (based on the [[Tathagatagarbha doctrine]]), building endless treasure houses, or Wujinzangyuan (無盡藏院) for giving charity to monks and people, and [[sky burial]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://coe21.zinbun.kyoto-u.ac.jp/djvuchar?8B7D,6BC0,6613,5FC3 隋大信行禪師銘塔碑]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Based in Hua Du monastery (化度寺) in [[Chang'an]], the movement was very popular in 600-700 CE.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jingangdhyanaincnet.org/12/1201/1201h2.html 《金剛禪世界》中國佛教教史大略．唐代佛教]&lt;/ref&gt; The monks lived in the Sanjiejiao house, or Sanjieyuan (三階院) inside Buddhist monasteries and built endless treasure houses. Its practices faced heavy criticism from many Buddhists and restriction by Buddhist [[Emperor Wen of Sui]] and [[Wu Zetian]] as unorthodox teachings.&lt;ref&gt;開元釋教錄 ([[Taisho Tripitaka]]  No. 2154)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang]] ordered the destruction of the Wujinzangyuan, the Sanjieyuan and the school's texts, sparing only the treasure houses. [[Bhikkhuni]] Zongjing (總靜) in the Zhixin monastery(直心寺) was a known practitioner who died in 831. Some texts, such as part of the three stages teachings (三階教法) were preserved in Japanese monasteries. Some were also found in [[Dunhuang]] texts and grottoes.&lt;ref&gt;三阶教研究论著目录A Summary of Materials and Studying Catalogs on Teaching of the Three Levels 作者:朱生云,王惠民, 敦煌学辑刊Journal of Dunhuang Studies 2008年第01期&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Second Temple Judaism''' is Judaism between the construction of the [[Second Temple]] in Jerusalem, c. 515 BCE, and its [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|destruction by the Romans in 70 CE]]. The [[development of the Hebrew Bible canon]], the [[synagogue]], Jewish [[Jewish eschatology|apocalyptic expectations for the future]], and the [[History of early Christianity|rise of Christianity]], can all be traced to the [[Second Temple period]].

==History==
{{main|Second Temple period}}
[[File:Jerus-n4i.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.3|Modern reconstruction of what the [[Second Temple]] would have looked like after its renovation during the reign of [[Herod the Great|Herod I]]]]
===Periods===
''(Note: dates and periods are in many cases approximate and/or conventional)''
* [[Babylonian exile]], 586–539 BCE
* [[Yehud Medinata|Persian]], 539–333 BCE
* [[Hellenistic Judaism|Hellenistic]], 333–164 BCE 
:* [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic]], 301–200 BCE
:* [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]], 200–164 BCE
* [[Hasmonean dynasty|Hasmonean]], 164–63 BCE
* [[Judea (Roman province)|Roman]], 63 BCE – 70 CE

===Jerusalem and Yehud===
The period of the First Temple ended in 586 BCE when the [[Neo-Babylonian empire|Babylonian]] king [[Nebuchadnezzar]] captured [[Jerusalem]], destroyed the [[Temple of Solomon]], and deported the elite of the population to Babylon (the "[[Babylonian exile]]").{{sfn|Grabbe|2010|p=2}} In 539 BCE Babylon itself fell to the Persian conqueror [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]], and in 538 BCE the exiles were permitted to return to [[Yehud medinata]], as the Persian province of Judah was known.{{sfn|Coogan|Brettler|Newsom|2007|p=xxii}} The Temple is commonly said to have been rebuilt in the period 520–515 BCE, but it seems probable that this is an artificial date chosen so that 70 years could be said to have passed between the destruction and the rebuilding, fulfilling a prophecy of [[book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]].{{sfn|Grabbe|2010|p=2–3}}{{sfn|Coogan|Brettler|Newsom|2007|p=xxii}}{{sfn|Davies|2005|p=89}}

The end of the Persian period is conventionally dated from [[Alexander the Great]]'s conquest of the Mediterranean coast in 333/332 BCE. His empire disintegrated after his death, and Judea, including Jerusalem, fell to the [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemies]], the descendants of one of Alexander's generals who ruled Egypt. In 200 BCE Israel and Yehud were captured by the [[Seleucid Syria|Seleucids]], the descendants of another Greek general ruling Syria. Around 167 BCE, for reasons that remain obscure, the Seleucid king [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]] attempted to suppress Jewish worship; this provoked a Jewish revolt (the [[Maccabean Revolt]]) that eventually led to the effective end of Greek control over Jerusalem.{{sfn|Grabbe|2010|p=5–17}}

Hasmonean Judea was a client kingdom of the Romans,{{sfn|Nelson|2010|p=256–257}} and in the 1st century BCE the Romans first replaced them with their protege [[Herod the Great]], and, on Herod's death in 6 CE, made [[Iudaea (Roman province)|Judea]] a province under Rome's direct rule.{{sfn|Malamat|Ben-Sasson|2010|p=245–246}} Heavy taxes under the Romans and insensitivity towards the Jewish religion led to revolt (the [[First Jewish–Roman War]], 66–73 CE), and in 70 CE the Roman general (and later emperor) [[Titus]] captured Jerusalem and destroyed the Temple, bringing an end to the Second Temple period.{{sfn|Malamat|Ben-Sasson|2010|p=299–303}}

===The diaspora===
The Jewish exiles in Babylon were not slaves or prisoners, nor were they badly treated, and when the Persians gave permission for them to return to Jerusalem the majority elected to remain where they were.{{sfn|Albertz|2003|p=101}}{{sfn|Berquist|2007|p=3-4}} They and their descendants formed the [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora]], a large community of Jews living outside Judea, and the 1st century CE historian [[Josephus]] reported that there were more Jews in Syria (meaning the [[Seleucid empire]]) than in any other land.{{sfn|Coogan|Brettler|Newsom|2007|p=xxv}}{{sfn|Hegermann|1990|p=146}} There was also significant Egyptian diaspora, although the Jews of Egypt were immigrants, not deportees, "...attracted by Hellenistic culture, eager to win the respect of the Greeks and to adapt to their ways" (John J. Collins, "Between Athens and Jerusalem).{{sfn|Collins|2000|p=5}} The Egyptian diaspora was slow to develop, but in the Hellenistic period it came to outstrip the Babylonian community in importance.{{sfn|Hegermann|1990|p=131}} In addition to these major centres there were Jewish communities throughout the Hellenistic and subsequently the Roman world, from North Africa to Asia Minor and Greece and in Rome itself.&lt;ref&gt;Strayer, Joseph R. ed.

===The Samaritans===
The separation between Jews of Jerusalem and those of [[Samaria]] was a long and protracted process.{{sfn|Cohen|2014|p=169}} For most of the Second Temple period Samaria was larger, richer, and more populous than Judea—down to about 164 BCE there were probably more [[Samaritans]] than Judeans living in Palestine.{{sfn|Knoppers|2013|p=1-3}} They had their own temple on [[Mount Gerizim]] near [[Shechem]] and regarded themselves as the only true Israel, the remnant left behind when Israel was deceived by the wicked priest Eli to leave Gerizim and worship at Jerusalem.{{sfn|Cohen|2014|p=168}} Second Temple Judeans regarded them as foreign converts and the offspring of mixed marriages, and therefore of impure blood.{{sfn|Knoppers|2013|p=1–3}} Relations between the two communities were often strained, but the definitive break dates from the destruction of the Gerizim temple and of Shechem by a Hasmonean king in the late 2nd century BCE; before that the Samaritans seem to have regarded themselves as part of the wider Jewish community, but afterwards they denounced the Jerusalem temple as completely unacceptable to God.{{sfn|Cohen|2014|p=168-169}}&lt;ref&gt;see also: Jonathan Bourgel, "The Destruction of the Samaritan Temple by John Hyrcanus: A Reconsideration", ''JBL'' 135/3 (2016), pp. 505–523 https://www.academia.edu/34049422/The_Destruction_of_the_Samaritan_Temple_by_John_Hyrcanus_A_Reconsideration &lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
In recent decades it has become increasingly common among scholars to assume that much of the [[Hebrew bible]] was assembled, revised and edited in the 5th century BCE to reflect the realities and challenges of the Persian era.{{sfn|Coogan|Brettler|Newsom|2007|p=xxiii}}{{sfn|Berquist|2007|p=3-4}} The returnees had a particular interest in the history of Israel: the written [[Torah]] (the books of [[book of Genesis|Genesis]], [[book of Exodus|Exodus]], [[Leviticus]], [[book of Numbers|Numbers]] and [[Deuteronomy]]), for example, may have existed in various forms during the Monarchy (the period of the [[history of ancient Israel and Judah|kingdoms of Israel and Judah]]), but it was in the Second Temple that it was edited and revised into something like its current form, and the [[Books of Chronicles|Chronicles]], a new history written at this time, reflects the concerns of the Persian Yehud in its almost-exclusive focus on [[kingdom of Judah|Judah]] and the Temple.{{sfn|Coogan|Brettler|Newsom|2007|p=xxiii}}

Prophetic works were also of particular interest to the Persian-era authors, with some works being composed at this time (the last ten chapters of [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] and the books of [[Book of Haggai|Haggai]], [[Book of Zechariah|Zechariah]], [[Book of Malachi|Malachi]] and perhaps [[Book of Joel|Joel]]) and the older prophets edited and reinterpreted.The corpus of [[Wisdom]] books saw the composition of [[Book of Job|Job]], parts of [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]], and possibly [[Ecclesiastes]], while the [[book of Psalms]] was possibly given its modern shape and division into five parts at this time (although the collection continued to be revised and expanded well into Hellenistic and even Roman times).{{sfn|Coogan|Brettler|Newsom|2007|p=xxiii}}

In the Hellenistic period the scriptures were translated into Greek by the Jews of the Egyptian diaspora, who also produced a rich literature of their own covering epic poetry, philosophy, tragedy and other forms. Less is known of the Babylonian diaspora, but the Seleucid period produced works such as the court tales of the [[Book of Daniel]] (chapters 1-6 of Daniel - chapters 7-12 were a later addition), and the books of [[Book of Tobit|Tobit]] and [[Book of Esther|Esther]].{{sfn|Coogan|Brettler|Newsom|2007|p=xxvi}} The eastern Jews were also responsible for the adoption and transmission of the Babylonian and Persian [[apocalypticism|apocalyptic]] tradition seen in Daniel.{{sfn|Coogan|Brettler|Newsom|2007|p=xxvxxvi}}

==Worship and the Jewish community==

===Israel as a holy community===
The Hebrew Bible represents the beliefs of only a small portion of the Israelite community, the members of a tradition that insisted on the exclusive worship of [[Yahweh]], who collected, edited and transmitted the biblical texts, and who saw their mission in a return to Jerusalem where they could impose their vision of genealogical purity, orthodox worship, and codified law on the local population.{{sfn|Wright|1999|p=52}}{{sfn|Nelson|2014|p=185}} In the earliest stages of the Persian period the returnees insisted on strict separation between themselves ("Israel") and the Judeans who had never gone into exile ("Canaanites"), to the extent of prohibiting intermarriage; this was presented in terms of religious purity, but there may have been a practical concern for land ownership.{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=443-447}} The concept of the Jewish people as a people chosen by God gave rise to innumerable break-away movements, each declaring that it alone represented Jewish holiness; the most extreme example was the Qumran sect (the [[Essenes]]), but Christianity too began as a Jewish sect that saw itself as the "true Israel".{{sfn|Flusser|2009|p=8}}

===Textual Judaism: priests and scribes===
Second Temple Judaism was centered not on synagogues, which began to appear only in the 3rd century BCE, and the reading and study of scripture, but on the Temple itself, and on a cycle of continual blood [[sacrifice]] (meaning the sacrifice of live animals). [[Torah]], or ritual law, was also important, and the Temple priests were responsible for teaching it, but the concept of [[scripture]] developed only slowly. While the written Torah (the Pentateuch) and the Prophets were accepted as authoritative by the 1st century CE, beyond this core the different Jewish groups continued to accept different groups of books as authoritative.{{sfn|Grabbe|2010|p=40-42}}

===The priesthood and the autonomy of Yehud===
The priesthood underwent profound changes with the Second Temple.{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=448}} Under the First Temple the priesthood had been subordinate to the kings, but in the Second Temple, with the monarchy and even the state no longer available, they became independent.{{sfn|Albertz|2003|p=130}} The priesthood under the High Priest (a position largely unknown in earlier times) became the governing authority, making the province of Yehud in a sense a [[theocracy]], although it seems unlikely that it had any more autonomy than was typical of the empire as a whole.{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=448}} In the Hellenistic period the High Priest continued to play a vital role with both cultic and civic obligations, and the office reached its height under the Hasmoneans, who made themselves priest-kings.{{sfn|Grabbe|2010|p=47}} Both Herod and the Romans severely reduced the importance of the office, appointing and deposing High Priests to suit their purposes.{{sfn|Grabbe|2010|p=47-48}}

==Intellectual currents==

===Monotheism=== 
There was a sharp break between ancient Israelite religion and the Judaism of the Second Temple.{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=449}} Pre-exilic Israel was [[polytheism|polytheistic]];{{sfn|Albertz|1994a|p=61}} [[Asherah]] was probably worshiped as Yahweh's consort, within his temples in Jerusalem, [[Bethel]], and Samaria, and a goddess called the [[Queen of heaven (antiquity)#Hebrew Bible references|Queen of Heaven]], probably a fusion of [[Astarte]] and the Mesopotamian goddess [[Ishtar]], was also worshiped.{{sfn|Ackerman|2003|p=395}} [[Baal]] and Yahweh coexisted in the early period, but were considered irreconcilable after the 9th century.{{sfn|Smith|2002|p=47}} The worship of Yahweh alone, the concern of a small party in the monarchic period, only gained ascendancy in the exilic and early post-exilic period,{{sfn|Albertz|1994a|p=61}} and it was only then that the very existence of other gods was denied.{{sfn|Betz|2000|p=917}}

===Messianism and the end times===
The Persian period saw the development of expectation in a future human king who would rule purified Israel as God's representative at the end of time – that is, a [[messiah]]. The first to mention this were [[Haggai]] and [[Zechariah (Hebrew prophet)|Zechariah]], both prophets of the early Persian period. They saw the messiah in [[Zerubbabel]], a descendant of the House of [[David]] who seemed, briefly, to be about to re-establish the ancient royal line, or in Zerubbabel and the first High Priest, Joshua (Zechariah writes of two messiahs, one royal and the other priestly). These early hopes were dashed (Zerubabbel disappeared from the historical record, although the High Priests continued to be descended from Joshua), and thereafter there are merely general references to a Messiah of (meaning descended from) David.{{sfn|Wanke|1984|p=182-183}}{{sfn|Albertz|2003|p=130}}

===Wisdom and the Word===
Wisdom, or ''hokmah'', implied the learning acquired by study and formal education: "those who can read and write, those who have engaged in study, and who know literature, are the wise ''par excellence''" (Grabbe, 2010, p.48).{{sfn|Grabbe|2010|p=48}} The literature associated with this tradition includes the books of [[book of Job|Job]], [[Psalms]], [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]], [[Ecclesiastes]], [[Song of Songs]], [[book of Sirach|Sirach]] and the [[Wisdom of Solomon]], the so-called [[Sapiential books]].{{sfn|Grabbe|2010|p=48}}

==The emergence of Christianity==
{{See also|Jewish messianism|Origins of Christianity}}

Christianity emerged within Judaism, the key difference being the Christian belief that Jesus was the resurrected Messiah.{{sfn|Cohen|2014|p=165-166}} Judaism is known to allow for multiple messiahs, the two most relevant being [[Messiah ben Joseph]] and the Messiah ben David. The idea of two messiahs — one suffering and the second fulfilling the traditional messianic role— was normal in ancient Judaism, and in fact predated Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=IVlZEHVmuw0C&amp;dq=The+Jew+Who+Would+Be+God&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OpbdUsehDubM2AXb94HwDw&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ| title = The Jewish Gospels: The Story of the Jewish Christ |author= Daniel Boyarin |publisher = New Press | year = 2012 | accessdate= 20 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=fgv4HVPgtp0C&amp;dq=The+Messiah+before+Jesus:+The+Suffering+Servant+of+the+Dead+Sea+Scrolls&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| title = The Messiah Before Jesus: The Suffering Servant of the Dead Sea Scrolls| author= Israel Knohl |publisher = University of California Press| year = 2000 | accessdate= 20 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=H23hArqmJsQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Review+of+Rabbinic+Judaism:+Ancient,+Medieval,+and+Modern&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=g6fdUpXGLonkyAH184DACw&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=post%20bethar&amp;f=false | title = The Review of Rabbinic Judaism: Ancient, Medieval, and Modern| pages= 91–112|editor= Alan J.

Alan Segal has written that "one can speak of a 'twin birth' of two new Judaisms, both markedly different from the religious systems that preceded them. Not only were rabbinic Judaism and Christianity religious twins, but, like Jacob and Esau, the twin sons of Isaac and Rebecca, they fought in the womb, setting the stage for life after the womb."&lt;ref&gt;Alan F. Segal, Rebecca's Children: Judaism and Christianity in the Roman World, Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The first Christians (the [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] or students of Jesus) were essentially all ethnically Jewish or Jewish proselytes. In other words, [[Cultural and historical background of Jesus|Jesus was Jewish]], preached to the Jewish people and called from them his first disciples.  Jewish Christians  regarded "Christianity" as an affirmation of every aspect of contemporary Judaism, with the addition of one extra belief &amp;mdash; that Jesus was the [[Messiah]].&lt;ref&gt;McGrath, Alister E., Christianity: An Introduction. Blackwell Publishing (2006). {{ISBN|1-4051-0899-1}}. Page 174: "In effect, they [[Jewish Christians]] seemed to regard Christianity as an affirmation of every aspect of contemporary Judaism, with the addition of one extra belief &amp;mdash; that Jesus was the Messiah. Unless males were [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|circumcised]], they could not be [[Salvation|saved]] (Acts 15:1)."&lt;/ref&gt;
The doctrines of the [[Apostle (Christian)|apostles of Jesus]] brought the Early Church into conflict with some Jewish religious authorities (Acts records dispute over the [[resurrection of the dead]], which was rejected by the [[Sadducees]], see also [[Persecution of Christians in the New Testament]]), and possibly later led to Christians' expulsion from [[synagogues]] (see [[Council of Jamnia]] for other theories). 
While [[Marcionism]] rejected all Jewish influence on Christianity, [[Proto-orthodox Christianity]] instead retained some of the doctrines and practices of 1st-century Judaism while rejecting others, see the [[Biblical law in Christianity#Historical background|Historical background to the issue of Biblical law in Christianity]] and [[Early Christianity]]. They held the [[Tanakh|Jewish scriptures]] to be authoritative and sacred, employing mostly the [[Septuagint]] or [[Targum]] translations, and adding other texts as the [[Development of the New Testament canon|New Testament canon developed]]. Christian [[baptism]] was another continuation of a Judaic practice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=222&amp;letter=B&amp;search=Baptism Jewish Encyclopedia: Baptism]: "According to rabbinical teachings, which dominated even during the existence of the Temple (Pes. viii. 8), Baptism, next to circumcision and sacrifice, was an absolutely necessary condition to be fulfilled by a [[proselyte]] to Judaism (Yeb. 46b, 47b; Ker. 9a; 'Ab. Zarah 57a; Shab. 135a; Yer. Kid. iii. 14, 64d). Circumcision, however, was much more important, and, like baptism, was called a "seal" (Schlatter, "Die Kirche Jerusalems," 1898, p. 70).&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent work by historians paints a more complex portrait of late Second Temple Judaism and early Christianity. Some historians have suggested that, before his death, Jesus created amongst his believers such certainty that the Kingdom of God and the resurrection of the dead was at hand, that with few exceptions (John 20: 24-29) when they saw him shortly after his execution, they had no doubt that he had been resurrected, and that the restoration of the Kingdom and resurrecton of the dead was at hand. These specific beliefs were compatible with Second Temple Judaism.{{sfn|Fredricksen|2000|p=133-134}} In the following years the restoration of the Kingdom, as Jews expected it, failed to occur. Some Christians began to believe instead that Christ, rather than simply being the Jewish messiah, was [[Incarnation (Christianity)|God made flesh]], who died for the sins of humanity, marking the beginning of [[Christology]].{{sfn|Fredricksen|2000|p=136-142}}

While on one hand Jesus and the early Christians had all been ethnically Jewish, the Jews by and large continued to reject Jesus as the Messiah. This was a source of embarrassment for the Church and affected early Christianity's relationship with Judaism and the surrounding pagan traditions. The anti-Christian polemicist [[Celsus]] criticised Jews for deserting their Jewish heritage while they had claimed to hold on to it. To the Emperor [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]], Christianity was simply an apostasy from Judaism. These factors hardened Christian attitudes towards Jewry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward Kessler|title=An Introduction to Jewish-Christian Relations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=87Woe7kkPM4C&amp;pg=PA45|date=18 February 2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-48730-6|pages=45–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7820">The '''Seybert Commission''' was a group of faculty members at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] who in 1884–1887 investigated a number of respected [[Spiritualism|spiritualist]] [[Mediumship|mediums]], uncovering fraud or suspected fraud in every case that they examined.

==Establishment of the Commission==
An ardent believer in Spiritualism, Henry Seybert left in his will funds for the establishment of an endowed chair in Philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania. As a condition to this bequest, he required that the University set up a commission to investigate "all systems of Morals, Religion, or Philosophy which assume to represent the Truth, and particularly of Modern Spiritualism."&lt;ref name=seybert&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/11950 The Seybert Commission Preliminary Report]&lt;/ref&gt;  Ten men served on the commission, all of whom declared themselves at the outset to either be neutral or favorably disposed toward Spiritualism. Among the more notable members were the University Provost [[William Pepper]] (a physician), the paleontologist [[Joseph Leidy]], the Shakespearean scholar [[Horace Howard Furness]] (who served as the chairman), and the physician and writer [[Silas Weir Mitchell (physician)|Silas Weir Mitchell]]. Also on the commission was George Augustus Koenig, a chemist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Appletons'|wstitle=Koenig, George Augustus|year=1892}}&lt;/ref&gt; A committed Spiritualist and close friend of Henry Seybert, Thomas Hazard, served as counselor, suggesting particular topics and mediums that should be investigated.&lt;ref name=seybert/&gt;

==Slate writing==
[[File:Slate writing example.png|thumb|Example of slate-writing.]]

The topic most conclusively investigated was "slate writing," in which the medium has two slates fastened together, so that the writing surfaces faced each other, out of reach of the medium, with a small piece of pencil between the two slates.  The medium holds the slates in her lap, and spirits purportedly write on the slates, sending the pencil outside the slates when finished. The Commission investigated Mrs. S.E. Patterson and Dr. [[Henry Slade]], both widely respected practitioners of slate writing. Mrs. Patterson proved unable to perform when under the scrutiny of the Commission, while Dr. Slade was found to be practicing fraud: either composing long, well-written messages before the séance, or loosening the screws holding the slates together and scrawling nearly illegible messages while holding the slates in his lap. The Commission also requested that a "professional juggler" attempt slate writing, and found that he was able to provide demonstrations "much more remarkable" than the "puerile" attempts at fraud by Dr. Slade.&lt;ref name=seybert/&gt; The Commission concluded that slate writing 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"is performed in a manner so closely resembling fraud as to be indistinguishable from it. It would be a mere matter of opinion that all Independent Slate Writing is fraudulent; what is not a matter of opinion is the conviction, which we have unanimously reached as a Commission, of its non-spiritual character in every instance that has come before us."&lt;ref name=seybert/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Spirit rappings==

The Commission also investigated "rappings", without coming to final conclusions. A thorough investigation of rappings required monitoring the medium's body closely to determine if the sound was caused by "voluntary muscular action." Such monitoring was "a matter of delicacy," and therefore difficult to accomplish. Nevertheless, the Commission was able to determine "that the Mediums were invariably, and confessedly, cognizant of the rappings whenever they occurred, and could at once detect any spurious rappings, however exact and indistinguishable to all other ears might be the imitation." This finding suggested that the medium, rather than spirits, were the source of the rappings.&lt;ref name=seybert/&gt;

==Movement of objects==

The commission investigated the physical mediumship of [[Pierre L. O. A. Keeler]] which involved the movement of musical instruments such as a guitar and a tambourine. The phenomena was suspected of being fraudulent, in most cases achieved if Keeler had been able to get his arm free from control.&lt;ref name=seybert/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Paul Christopher. (2014). ''Spirited Things: The Work of "Possession" in Afro-Atlantic Religions''. University of Chicago Press. pp. 95-96. {{ISBN|978-0-226-12262-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spirit photography==
The Commission attempted to examine a famed "spirit photographer," [[William M. Keeler]].&lt;ref name=seybert/&gt;

[[Spirit photography]], in the 1880s, was much like conventional portrait photography, except that the developed plates would show shadowy figures, usually identified by the subject as deceased loved ones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prairieghosts.com/ph_history.html History of Spirit Photography] Accessed 28 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Keeler demanded such a high fee and imposed so many conditions on the Commission that they concluded that he was unwilling to be examined and that investigating him would be a waste of time. The Commission noted that "In these days of 'Composite Photography' it is worse than childish to claim a Spiritual source for results which can be obtained at any time by any tyro in the art."&lt;ref name=seybert/&gt;

==The Report==
The Commission published a report in 1887 entitled ''Preliminary Report of the Commission Appointed by the University of Pennsylvania to Investigate Modern Spiritualism In Accordance with the Request of the Late Henry Seybert'', in which it expressed:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"...our regret that thus far we have not been cheered in our investigations by the discovery of a single novel fact; but, undeterred by this discouragement, we trust with your permission to continue them with what thoroughness our future opportunities may allow, and with minds as sincerely and honestly open, as heretofore, to conviction."&lt;ref name=seybert/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The report was published by J.B. Lippincott, and angrily denounced by Spiritualists. There proved to be no sentiment for the Commission's continued existence, and it quietly disbanded.&lt;ref name=drabelle&gt;Drabelle 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance of the Seybert Commission==
A number of independent investigators examined the claims of Spiritualists in the Nineteenth Century. The Seybert Commission stands as an example of reputable and impartial investigators concluding that Spiritualist mediums were engaging in fraud.&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher, Eugene V; Ashcraft, W. Michael. (2006). ''Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America''. Greenwood. pp. 39-40. {{ISBN|978-0275987121}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=drabelle/&gt; The report's appendices provide a good primary source describing how Spiritualist mediums operated in the mid-1880s.

[[File:Types of Shinto shide en.png|thumb|300px|Types of ''shide'']]

{{Nihongo|'''''Shide'''''|[[wiktionary:紙垂|紙垂]], [[wiktionary:四手|四手]]}} is a [[zigzag]]-shaped [[paper]] streamer, often seen attached to ''[[shimenawa]]'' or ''[[tamagushi]]'', and used in [[Shinto]] rituals. A popular ritual is using a ''[[Ōnusa|haraegushi]]'', or "lightning wand", named for the zig-zag ''shide'' paper that adorns the wand. A similar wand, used by [[miko]] for purification and blessing, is the [[gohei]] with two shide. A Shinto priest waves the ''haraegushi'' over a person, item, or newly bought property, such as a building or car. The wand is waved at a slow rhythmic pace, but with a little force so that the ''shide'' strips make a rustling noise on each pass of the wand. For new properties, a similar ritual known as ''jijin sai'' is performed with a ''haraegushi'', an enclosed part of the land (enclosed by ''shimenawa''), and [[sake]], or ritually purified sake known as ''o-miki''. The ''haraegushi'' has been used for centuries in Shinto ceremonies and has similarities in [[Ainu people|Ainu]] culture. In Ainu culture, a shaved willow branch called an ''[[inaw]]'' or ''inau'' closely resembles the Shinto ''haraegushi'', and is used in similar blessing rituals.

'''Sindoor''' or '''Sindooram''' is a traditional [[vermilion]] red or orange-red colored [[Cosmetics|cosmetic]] [[powder (substance)|powder]] from  [[Indian Subcontinent]], usually worn by [[marriage|married]] women along the part of their hair.&lt;ref name="ref24qumor"&gt;{{Cite document | title=Women Writing in India: The twentieth century (Volume 2 of Women Writing in India: 600 B.C. to the Present) | author=Susie J.

==Application of sindoor==
[[File:Subrata Ganguly - Howrah 2013-10-14 3508.JPG|thumb|Women with sindur]]
[[File:Sindur Play - Howrah 2013-10-14 3496.JPG|thumb|right|Women with sindur]]
Sindoor is traditionally applied at the beginning or completely along the parting-line of a woman’s hair (also called ''maang'' in Hindi or "Seemandarekha" in Sanskrit) or as a [[Bindi (decoration)|dot on the forehead]]. Sindoor is the mark of a married woman in [[Hinduism]]. Single women wear the bindi in different colors but do not apply sindoor in their parting of the hairline. Widows do not wear sindoor, signifying that their husband is no longer alive.

The sindoor is first applied to the woman by her husband on the day of her wedding; this is called the Sindoor Daanam ceremony. After this, she applies it herself every day.

A similar coloring ritual is known as [[pasupu kumkuma]], named after another name for sindoor, [[kumkuma]].

The wiping off of the sindoor is very significant for a widow. There are many rituals associated with this practice. The most common is when a mother-in-law or older sister-in-law wipes off the sindoor when a woman becomes a widow. The widow will break her bangles and remove her [[bottu]] as well, and many will also remove their nose ring and toe rings. The parting of hair is symbolic of a river of red blood full of life. When the sindoor is removed then the river becomes barren, dry and empty. This custom is prevalent in rural areas and is followed by all castes and social ranks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bollywoodshaadis.com/articles/significance-of-sindoor-for-an-indian-married-woman-2022] The Real Significance Of ‘Ek Chutki Sindoor’ for Hindu Married Women&lt;/ref&gt;

The red sindoor is significant for the married woman as she is full of colour. When she becomes a widow she adopts plain white dress and removes all colour from her face including the bright red sindoor.

Methods and styles of applying the sindoor vary from personal choice to regional customs. Many new brides will fill the whole hair line with sindoor, while other married women may just apply a red spot at the end of the hair line and forehead. Recently, a triangle shape on the forehead pointing towards the nose, with a diamond bindi for fashion, is being worn by younger women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianfashionlife.com/how-to-put-sindoor-on-forehead.html/ How To Put Sindoor On Forehead] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161129212026/http://www.indianfashionlife.com/how-to-put-sindoor-on-forehead.html/ |date=2016-11-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/fashion/trends/Fashion-that-defies-customs/articleshow/42701689.cms Fashion that defies customs] The Times of India- V Lakshmi -Jan 8, 2015,&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hinduism==
[[File:Sindoor in the Indian Hindu Wedding.JPG|250px|thumb|The ritual of applying the sindoor as part of a Hindu Indian wedding]]
Female figurines excavated at [[Mehrgarh]], [[Baluchistan]] seem to imply application of sindoor to the partition of women's hair in [[Harappa]] culture. According to the legends, [[Radha]] the consort of Lord [[Krishna]] turned the [[kumkum]] into a flame-like design on her forehead. In the famous epic [[Mahabharata]], [[Draupadi]] the wife of the [[Pandavas]] wipes off her sindoor in disgust and despair at the happenings in [[Hastinapura]]. Use of sindoor is frequently mentioned in the [[puranas]] ''[[Lalitha Sahasranama]]'' and ''[[Soundarya Lahari]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.surfindia.com/matrimonials/history-significance-sindoor.html History and Significance of Sindoor]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adi Shankaracharya]] writes in ''[[Soundarya Lahari]]'':&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sankaracharya.org/soundarya_lahari.php Soundarya Lahari translated by P. R. Ramachander&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jainism|Jain]] women apply the sindoor, mostly in the cities. Jain nuns are forbidden to apply this to their hair line or foreheads. The display of the sindoor is considered very important to indicate the married status of the groom,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Ahearn, Laura M | title=Invitation to love: Literacy, Love Letters, &amp; Social Change in Nepal | publisher=University of Michigan : Michigan | year=2001 | pages=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Selwyn, Tom | title=Images of Reproduction: An Analysis of a Hindu Marriage Ceremony | journal= | volume=14 | issue=4 |date=December 1979 | pages=684–698}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in several local cultures, sindooram is applied on their hair partings by unmarried women.

Application of sindoor is essentially a Hindu tradition. In the 19th century, [[Sufi]] leader [[Sharafuddin Maneri]] encouraged Muslim women to apply sindoor in Bangladesh. This was severely condemned by reformist movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Akbar, M J | title=The Shades of Swords: Jihad and the conflict between Islam and Christianity | publisher=Routledge: London, New York | year=2002 | pages=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Composition and as Ayurvedic Medicine==
There are various forms of Sindhoor mentioned in Ayurveda. Traditional sindhoor is made from natural ingredients used for facial makeup(cosmetics). Most widely used traditional Sindhoor is made from turmeric and lime juice. Other ingredients include [[Ghee]], and slaked lime. This is also called Kumkum. Sindhoor is also made from red sandal powder, saffron etc. The coloured powders sold as substitutes are traditionally not considered Sindhoor.

==Toxicity Concerns of Synthetic Colour==
[[File:Boys in red.jpg|thumb|Boys covered with mercury-containing red [[vermilion]] chemical in a factory producing colour in [[Bangladesh]]]]
Modern material being sold as Sindhoor mainly uses vermilion, an orange-red pigment. Vermilion is the purified and powdered form of [[cinnabar]], which is the chief form in which [[mercury sulfide]] naturally occurs. As with other compounds of mercury, sindoor is toxic and must be handled carefully. Sometimes, [[lead tetroxide|red lead]] (lead tetroxide, also known as minium) is added to sindoor.&lt;ref name="ref22horoz"&gt;{{Cite document |title= Indian pediatrics, Volume 10 | publisher=Indian Academy of Pediatrics |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Zkc7AAAAIAAJ | quote=''...

'' | year=1973 | postscript={{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Red lead is toxic and a known carcinogen for laboratory animals, though its carcinogenicity to humans has not been established.

==In popular culture==
[[File:Shop selling Sindoor (Vermilion) in Pushkar, Rajasthan.jpg|right|thumb|Shop selling sindoor in [[Pushkar]], Rajasthan]]
There are many Indian movies and dramas involving sindoor, with their themes revolving around the ritual's significance.  These include ''[[Sindoor (1947 film)|Sindoor]]'' (1947), ''[[Sindooram]]'' (1976), [[Rakta Sindhuram]] (1985), ''[[Sindoor (film)|Sindoor]]'' (1987), and  ''[[Sindoor Tere Naam Ka]]'' (series, 2005–2007).

The '''Soka Gakkai International''' (SGI—"Value Creation Association International") is an international [[Nichiren Buddhism|Nichiren Buddhist]] organization founded in 1975 by [[Daisaku Ikeda]].&lt;ref name=georgetown&gt;{{cite web |title=Soka Gakkai International |publisher=Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, &amp; World Affairs |url=http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/organizations/soka-gakkai-international |accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SGI is the world's largest Buddhist lay organization, with approximately 12 million Nichiren Buddhist practitioners in 192 countries and regions.&lt;ref name=oxford&gt;{{cite web |title=Soka Gakkai |author=Andrew Gebert |publisher=Oxford Bibliographies |url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195393521/obo-9780195393521-0053.xml |accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=No more nukes, Sokka Gakkai International's president calls for nuclear nonproliferation |author=Tricycle Buddhist Review |year=2015 |url=http://www.tricycle.com/blog/no-more-nukes |accessdate=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It characterizes itself as a support network for practitioners of Nichiren Buddhism and a global Buddhist movement for "peace, education, and cultural exchange."&lt;ref name=marshall&gt;{{cite book |title=Global Institutions of Religion: Ancient Movers, Modern Shakers |author=Katherine Marshall |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781136673580}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SGI is a [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO) with consultative status with UNESCO since 1983.&lt;ref name = unoda&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.un.org/disarmament/update/20140321/ | title = UN Office for Disarmament Affairs Meets Youth Representatives of Soka Gakkai Japan and of SGI-USA Engaged in Disarmament Issues| publisher = United Nations | accessdate = 15 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Soka Gakkai International (SGI) was formed at a world peace conference of [[Nichiren Buddhism|Nichiren Buddhists]] on January 26, 1975, on the island of [[Guam]].&lt;ref name="living-dialogue"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Living Dialogue: Socrates to Ikeda |publisher=Gandhi Media Centre |author=N. Radhakrishnan |oclc=191031200}}&lt;/ref&gt; Representatives from 51 countries attended the meeting and chose [[Daisaku Ikeda]], who served as third president of the Japanese Buddhist organization [[Soka Gakkai]], to become the SGI's founding president.&lt;ref name="living-dialogue"/&gt;[[File:SGI-USA Chicago Culture Center.jpg|thumb|182px|An SGI center in [[Chicago]]]] The SGI was created in part as a new international [[peace movement]], and its founding meeting was held in Guam in a symbolic gesture referencing Guam's history as the site of some of World War II's bloodiest battles, and proximity to [[Tinian Island]], launching place of the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], Japan.&lt;ref name="global-perspectives"&gt;{{cite news |title=SPECIAL REPORT: Peace Impulses from Okinawa |author=Ramesh Jaura |work=Global Perspectives |url=http://www.global-perspectives.info/index.php/international-edition/2011/february/100-special-report-peace-impulses-from-okinawa |accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soka Gakkai's initial global expansion began after [[South-East Asian theatre of World War II|World War II]], when some [[Soka Gakkai]] members married mostly American servicemen and moved away from Japan.&lt;ref name=laderman&gt;{{cite book |title=Religion and American Cultures: An Encyclopedia of Traditions, Diversity, and Popular Expressions |author=Gary Laderman |publisher=ABC CLIO |year=2003 |isbn=9781576072387}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expansion efforts gained a further boost in 1960 when [[Daisaku Ikeda]] succeeded [[Jōsei Toda]] as president of the Soka Gakkai.&lt;ref name=pereira&gt;{{cite journal |title=The transplantation of Soka Gakkai to Brazil: building "the closest organization to the heart of Ikeda-Sensei" |author=Ronan Alves Pereira |journal=Japanese Journal of Religious Studies |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=strand&gt;{{cite news |title=Faith in Revolution |date=Winter 2008 |author=Clark Strand |work=Tricycle |url=http://www.tricycle.com/interview/faith-revolution |accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first year of his presidency, Ikeda visited the [[United States]], [[Canada]], and [[Brazil]], and the Soka Gakkai's first American headquarters officially opened in [[Los Angeles]] in 1963.&lt;ref name=pereira/&gt;&lt;ref name=prebish&gt;{{cite book |title=Luminous Passage: The Practice and Study of Buddhism in America |author=Charles Prebish |publisher=University of California Press |year=1999 |isbn=9780520216976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, [[Uruguay]] honored the 25th anniversary of the SGI's founding with a commemorative postage stamp. The stamp was issued on October 2, the anniversary of SGI President Ikeda's first overseas journey in 1960.&lt;ref name = uruguay&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.correo.com.uy/index.asp?codpag=detProd&amp;smen=filatelia&amp;idp=701&amp;s=1 | title = Sello - 1975-2000 Soka Gakkai Internacional 25º Aniversario | publisher = Correo Uruguayo | accessdate = 3 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, the director of the [[Peace Research Institute Oslo]] reported that the SGI had been nominated for the 2015 Nobel Peace Prize, as confirmed by a Nobel Peace Laureate.&lt;ref name = PRIO&gt;{{ cite web | url = https://www.prio.org/About/PeacePrize/PRIO-Directors-Speculations-2015/ | title = Nobel Peace Prize 2015: PRIO Director's Speculations|publisher = PRIO | accessdate = 10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015, the SGI-USA was one of the organizing groups for the first-ever Buddhist conference at the [[White House]].&lt;ref name = washpost&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2015/05/12/125-u-s-buddhist-leaders-to-meet-at-the-white-house/ | title = U.S., Buddhist Leaders to Meet at the White House | publisher = Washington Post | accessdate = 10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, the [[Soka Gakkai Italian Buddhist Institute|SGI-Italy]] was recognized by the Italian government with a special accord under [[Constitution of Italy|Italian Constitution]] Article 8, acknowledging it as an [[Religion in Italy#Freedom of religion|official religion of Italy]] and eligible to receive direct taxpayer funding for its religious and social activities. It also recognizes the Soka Gakkai as a "Concordat" (It: "Intesa") that grants the  religions status in "a special 'club' of denominations consulted by the government in certain occasions, allowed to appoint chaplains in the army - a concordat is not needed for appointing chaplains in hospitals and jails - and, perhaps more importantly, to be partially financed by taxpayers' money." Eleven other religious denominations share this status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Introvigne |first1=Massimo |title=Italy signs Concordat with Soka Gakkai |url=http://www.cesnur.org/2015/intesa_soka.html|website=Cesnur.org |publisher=[[CESNUR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = berkley&gt;{{cite web | url = http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/essays/religion-in-the-italian-constitution | title = Religion in the Italian Constitution | publisher = Georgetown University | accessdate = 10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = italy&gt;{{cite web | url =  http://www.governo.it/Presidenza/USRI/confessioni/intese_indice.html | title = Istituto Buddista Italiano Soka Gakkai | publisher = Governo Italiano | accessdate = 14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
The Soka Gakkai International comprises a global network of affiliated organizations. As of 2011, the SGI reported active national organizations in 192 countries and territories with a total of approximately 12 million members.&lt;ref name=oxford/&gt; The SGI is independent of the Soka Gakkai (the domestic Japanese organization), although both are headquartered in [[Tokyo]].&lt;ref name=metraux&gt;{{cite journal |title=Soka Gakkai International: The Global Expansion of a Japanese Buddhist Movement |author=Daniel Métraux |journal=Religion Compass |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

National SGI organizations operate autonomously and all affairs are conducted in the local language.&lt;ref name=metraux/&gt; Many national organizations are coordinated by groups such as a women's group, a men's group, and young women's and young men's groups.&lt;ref name=metraux2&gt;{{cite journal |title=Soka Gakkai International: Japanese Buddhism on a Global Scale |author=Daniel Métraux |journal=Virginia Review of Asian Studies |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; National organizations generally raise their own operational funds, although the SGI headquarters in Tokyo has awarded funding grants to smaller national organizations for projects such as land acquisition and the construction of new buildings.&lt;ref name=metraux2/&gt; SGI-affiliated organizations outside Japan are forbidden to engage directly in politics.&lt;ref name=metraux2/&gt;

While the national organizations are run autonomously, the Tokyo headquarters of SGI disseminates doctrinal and teaching materials to all national organizations around the world.&lt;ref name=metraux2/&gt; The Tokyo headquarters also serves as a meeting place for national leaders to come together and exchange information and ideas.&lt;ref name=metraux2/&gt;

The election or nomination of the leaders is typically not decided by the SGI's general membership but by a [[board of directors]].&lt;ref&gt;http://constitution-sgic.org/PDFs/G3%20policy%20on%20leaders%20-%202014%2009%2027.PDF Governance Policy #3 - Leaders&lt;/ref&gt; Leadership below national staff, however, has been liberalized; in the United States for instance, the nomination and approval of leaders includes both members and organizational leaders in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dobbelaere|first1=Karel|title=Soka Gakkai|date=1998|publisher=Signat}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dobbelaere notes the election of the presidents,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dobbelaere|first1=Karel|title=Soka Gakkai|page=9|quote="H. Hojo. . . was elected president.  Ikeda became honorary president. . . At the death of Hojo in 1981, E. Akiya was elected president. . ." . .}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a process of "nomination, review and approval that involves both peers and leaders" in choosing other leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dobbelaere|first1=Karel|title=Soka Gakkai|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs and practice==
SGI members practice [[Nichiren Buddhism]] as interpreted and applied by the Soka Gakkai's first three presidents: [[Tsunesaburo Makiguchi]], [[Josei Toda]] and [[Daisaku Ikeda]].&lt;ref name=tamaru&gt;{{cite book |title=Soka Gakkai In Historical Perspective: in Global Citizens |author=Noriyoshi Tamaru |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-924039-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; SGI members believe in [[karma]]&lt;ref name=chryssides&gt;{{cite book |title=A Reader in New Religious Movements: Readings in the Study of New Religious Movements |author=Georgye D. Chryssides |author2=Margaret Wilkins |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=0826461689}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the most expedient path to enlightenment is through the practice of Nichiren Buddhism.&lt;ref name=metraux/&gt; SGI members identify three basic elements for applying Nichiren Buddhism to daily life: [[Soka Gakkai#Faith, practice, and study|faith, practice, and study]].&lt;ref name=lebron&gt;{{cite book |title=Searching For Spiritual Unity...Can There Be Common Ground |author=Robyn E. Lebron |publisher=CrossBooks |isbn=1462712622}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The daily practice of SGI members centers on chanting the [[mantra]] "''[[Namu Myōhō Renge Kyō|Nam Myoho Renge Kyo]]''" which translates to "Devotion to the Mystic Law of Cause and Effect through Sound", or "Glory to the Sutra of the Lotus of the Supreme Law"&lt;ref&gt;SGDB 2002, [http://www.sgilibrary.org/search_dict.php?id=1321 Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Law]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kenkyusha|title=Kenkyusha's New Japanese-English Dictionary|year=1991|publisher=Kenkyusha Limited|location=Tokyo|isbn=4-7674-2015-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; (cf.  detailed meaning of [[Ongi kuden#Nam-myoho-renge-kyo|Nam-myoho-renge-kyo]] in [[Ongi kuden]]). Once in the morning and again at night, SGI members do ''gongyo'' ("''assiduous practice''"), during which members chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo and recite selections from two chapters of the [[Lotus Sutra]], "Expedient Means" (chapter 2) and "The Life Span of the Thus Come One" (chapter 16).&lt;ref name=chryssides/&gt;&lt;ref name=lebron/&gt; ''Gongyo'' is typically performed in front of a ''[[Gohonzon]]'', a scroll considered to be the supreme object of devotion on which is written the ''daimoku'' (in other words, Nam-myoho-renge-kyo) and signs of buddhas and [[bodhisattva]]s who are prominent in the Lotus Sutra.&lt;ref name=seager&gt;{{cite book |title=Buddhism in America |author=Richard Hughes Seager |publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=0231108680}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Gohonzon'' itself is housed in a ''[[butsudan]],'' an altar that is opened during chanting of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo and ''gongyo''.&lt;ref name=arweck&gt;{{cite book |title=Theorizing Faith: The Insider/Outsider Problem in the Study of Ritual |author=Elisabeth Arweck |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=1902459334}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is the name of this potential or Buddha nature within our life. To chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, then, is to call forth your Buddha nature. SGI President Daisaku Ikeda once wrote, “Daimoku (Nam-myoho-renge-kyo) is a universal language that is instantly understood by Buddhas.” &lt;ref&gt;http://www.sgi-usa.org/basics-of-buddhism/&lt;/ref&gt;

SGI members also incorporate social interaction and engagement into their Buddhist practice.&lt;ref name=dobbelaere&gt;{{cite book |title=Soka Gakkai: From Lay Movement to Religion |author=Karel Dobbelaere |publisher=Signature Books |isbn=1560851538}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monthly neighborhood [[Zadankai|discussion meetings]] are generally held at the homes of SGI members.&lt;ref name=lebron/&gt; In the United States, for example, a study characterizes these organizational practices as socially inclusive Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chappell |first=David |editor-last1=Machacek |editor-first1=David |editor-last2=Wilson |editor-first2=Bryan |title=Global Citizens: The Soka Gakkai Buddhist Movement in the World |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2000 |pages=299–325 |chapter=Chapter 11: Socially Inclusive Buddhists in America |isbn=0-19-924039-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1995, the SGI has formally officiated same-sex marriages. In 2008, the SGI-USA, which is headquartered in California, publicly opposed that state's [[Proposition 8]] (which sought to prevent same-sex marriage), and the SGI coordinated with other progressive religious groups to support same-sex couples' right to legally marry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://articles.latimes.com/1995-07-01/local/me-19075_1_buddhist-groups | title = U.S. Buddhist Group Approves Marriage Rites for Gays | publisher = Los Angeles Times | accessdate = 21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Mormons-urged-to-back-ban-on-same-sex-marriage-3279112.php | title = Mormons urged to back ban on same sex marriage | publisher = SF Gate | accessdate = 21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==

The Soka Gakkai International is notable among Buddhist organizations for the racial and ethnic diversity of its members.&lt;ref name=metraux/&gt; It has been characterized as the world's largest and most ethnically diverse Buddhist group.&lt;ref name=laderman/&gt;&lt;ref name=strand/&gt;&lt;ref name=metraux/&gt;&lt;ref name=washingtonpost&gt;{{cite news |title=Diversity and a Buddhist Sect |author=Daniel Burke |work=The Washington Post |date=24 February 2007 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/23/AR2007022301394.html |accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Susumu Shimazono suggested several reasons for this: the strongly felt needs of individuals in their daily lives, its solutions to discord in interpersonal relations, its practical teachings that offer concrete solutions for carrying on a stable social life, and its provision of a place where congenial company and a spirit of mutual support may be found.&lt;ref name=shimazono&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Expansion of Japan's New Religions into Foreign Cultures |author=Susumu Shimazono |journal=Japanese Journal of Religious Studies |year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Clarke wrote that the SGI appeals to non-Japanese in part because "no one is obliged to abandon their native culture or nationality in order to fully participate in the spiritual and cultural life of the movement."&lt;ref name=clarke&gt;{{cite book |author=Peter B. Clarke |title=Japanese New Religions in Global Perspective |publisher=Curzon Press |year=2000 |chapter='Success' and 'Failure': Japanese New Religions Abroad |isbn=0700711856}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Italian newspaper [[la Repubblica]] reported that half of all Buddhists in Italy are SGI members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://firenze.repubblica.it/cronaca/2015/06/27/news/firenze_renzi_firma_l_intesta_tra_lo_stato_e_l_istituto_buddista_d_italia-117841335/?refresh_ce#gallery-slider=117843818 | title = La Soka Gakkai entra nell'8x1000, Renzi a Firenze firma l'intesa con l'istituto buddista| publisher = Repubblica | accessdate = 10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Initiatives promoting peace, culture and education==
According to Yoichi Kawada, director of the Tokyo-based Institute of Oriental Philosophy, the SGI defines itself as a "movement for contributing to peace, culture and education" based on its "interpretation and practical application of the ideas in the Lotus Sutra."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kawada |first=Yoichi |year=2009 |title=The SGI Within the Historical Context of Buddhism—and Its Philosophical Basis |url=http://www.totetu.org/assets/media/paper/j019_103.pdf |format=pdf |journal=The Journal of Oriental Studies |volume=19 |page=103 |access-date=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; SGI engagement as a religious [[NGO]] affiliated with the United Nations in policy discussions on issues including human rights, sustainable development and peace building is similarly described, in the phrasing of its Charter, as contributing to peace, culture and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Berger |first=Julia |date=March 2003 |title=Religious Nongovernmental Organizations: An Exploratory Analysis  |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1022988804887 |journal=Voluntas |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=15–39 |doi=10.1023/A:1022988804887 |subscription=yes |access-date=9 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|15,16,30}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sgi.org/about-us/sgi-charter.html |title=SGI Charter |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=n.d. |website=Soka Gakkai International |access-date=9 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nuclear disarmament===
Since 2007, the SGI has collaborated closely with the [[International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons]] (ICAN) to develop educational programs and raise awareness on nuclear disarmament, particularly among young people. The SGI also partnered with ICAN to promote the [[Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons]], which was adopted at the [[United Nations]] in July 2017, and for which ICAN was awarded the 2017 [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. Beatrice Fihn, executive director of ICAN, stated in a July 2017 interview that the "SGI has been one of our greatest partners in the fight to abolish nuclear weapons."&lt;ref name = ICAN&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.lionsroar.com/ican-partnered-with-sgi-wins-2017-nobel-peace-prize-for-work-toward-abolition-of-nuclear-weapons/ | title = ICAN Partnered With SGI Wins 2017 Nobel Peace Prize for Work Toward Abolition of Nuclear Weapons | publisher = Lion's Roar Magazine | accessdate = 28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To further increase public awareness of the [[anti-nuclear movement]], the SGI also created "The People's Decade" campaign, which since 2007 has developed a global grassroots network of people dedicated to abolishing nuclear weapons.&lt;ref name = peoples&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.peoplesdecade.org/ | title = People's Decade for Nuclear Ambition| publisher = People's Decade | accessdate = 15 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = wagingpeace&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.wagingpeace.org/five-million-voices-for-nuclear-zero/ | title = Five Million Voices for Nuclear Zero| publisher = Waging Peace | accessdate = 15 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, an SGI youth delegation met with the [[United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs]] (UNODA) regarding coordination of the SGI's efforts and the [[United Nations|UN]] efforts to increase grassroots movements for nuclear abolition.

In 2008, then-High Representative for Disarmament Affairs [[Sergio Duarte]] characterized SGI's work toward nuclear disarmament as linking [[human security]] with the fundamental goal of eliminating nuclear weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Duarte |first=Sergio |author-link=Sergio Duarte |title=Opening Remarks | url=https://www.un.org/disarmament/HomePage/HR/docs/2008/2008April30_Geneva.pdf |format=pdf |website=United Nations |date=30 April 2008 |access-date=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Pax Christi|Pax Christi International]], on March 28, 2017, a joint statement of Faith Communities Concerned about Nuclear Weapons, initiated by the SGI, was delivered by Pax Christi Philippines during the first UN negotiating conference for the [[Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons|treaty to prohibit nuclear weapons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Watch: Interfaith statement delivered at UN nuclear weapons negotiations |url=http://www.indcatholicnews.com/news.php?viewStory=32236 |work=Independent Catholic News (ICN) |date=2017-03-29 |access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 20 religious leaders affirmed through the joint statement their shared "aspirations for peace and for a world where people live without fear," praising world leaders in attendance for "the courage to begin these negotiations" and calling on States not in attendance to join the June–July session of the conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kenny |first=Peter |title=Faith groups call for action at UN atomic weapons' talks that nuclear-armed nations boycott |url=http://www.ecumenicalnews.com/article/faith-groups-call-for-action-at-un-atomic-weapons-talks-that-nuclear-armed-nations-boycott/60210.htm |website=Ecumenical News |date=2017-04-02 |access-date=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Faith Communities Concerned about Nuclear Weapons |title=Public Statement to the First Negotiation Conference for a treaty to prohibit nuclear weapons leading to their elimination |type=Statement |url=http://www.sgi.org/content/files/resources/ngo-resources/peace-disarmament/ptnw-public-statement-march-2017.pdf |format=pdf |date=March 2017  |access-date=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental awareness===
The SGI also promotes environmental initiatives through educational activities such as exhibitions, lectures and conferences, and more direct activities such as tree planting projects and the SGI's Amazon Ecological Conservation Center, which is administered by SGI-Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dessì |first=Ugo |date=2013 |title='Greening Dharma': Contemporary Japanese Buddhism and Ecology |url=https://www.academia.edu/11283180/_Greening_Dharma_Contemporary_Japanese_Buddhism_and_Ecology |journal=JSRNC |publisher=Equinox Publishing, Ltd |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=339–40 |doi=10.1558/jsrnc.v7i3.334 |access-date=March 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The center is engaged in reforestation, the creation of a regional seed bank, and experiments in sustainable agroforestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Seager |first=Richard |year=2006 |title=Encountering the Dharma |publisher=University of California Press |publication-place=Berkeley |pages=192 |url=|access date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One scholar cites [[Daisaku Ikeda]], SGI's president, describing such initiatives as a Buddhist-based impetus for direct public engagement in parallel with legal efforts to address environmental concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dessì |first=Ugo |date=2013 |title='Greening Dharma': Contemporary Japanese Buddhism and Ecology |url=https://www.academia.edu/11283180/_Greening_Dharma_Contemporary_Japanese_Buddhism_and_Ecology |journal=JSRNC |publisher=Equinox Publishing, Ltd |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=340 |doi=10.1558/jsrnc.v7i3.334 |access-date=March 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, the Bharat Soka Gakkai (the SGI of India) debuted the traveling exhibit "Seeds of Hope," a joint initiative of the SGI and [[Earth Charter Initiative#Organization|Earth Charter International]]. At the exhibit's opening in [[Panaji]], the state capital of [[Goa]], regional planning head Edgar Ribeiro spoke of lagging efforts to implement environmental laws and stated that "Only a people's movement can take sustainability forward."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ribeiro |first=Edgar |date=2016-02-12 |title=Edgar Riberio pushes for mapping Goa |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/Edgar-Ribeiro-pushes-for-mapping-of-Goa/articleshow/50956381.cms |newspaper=Times of India |access-date=2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Malaysia, [[Tunku Abdul Rahman University College]] President Datuk Dr Tan Chik Heok said that this exhibition helped "to create the awareness of the power of a single individual in bringing about waves of positive change to the environment, as well as the society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  |title=Sowing the seeds of hope |url=http://www.thestar.com.my/news/education/2014/11/16/sowing-the-seeds-of-hope/ | newspaper=The Star online |date=2014-11-16 |access-date=2016-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015, the SGI signed on to the Buddhist Climate Change Statement representing "over a billion Buddhists worldwide" in a call to action submitted to world leaders at the [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference|21st session of UN climate change]] talks held in Paris].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Buddhist Climate Change Statement to World Leaders|url=https://gbcccdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/buddhist-climate-change-statement-to-world-leaders-nov-25.pdf| publisher=Global Buddhist Climate Change Collective| date=November 25, 2015| access-date=May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statement affirms that Buddhist spirituality compels environmental protection and expresses solidarity with Catholic and Muslim leaders who have taken a similar stance. Described as "one of the most unified calls by a religion's leadership,"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| last=Schouten| first=Lucy| title=Why climate change unites Buddhists around the world| newspaper=The Christian Science Monitor| date=October 30, 2015| url=http://www.csmonitor.com/layout/set/print/Environment/2015/1030/Why-climate-change-unites-Buddhists-around-the-world| access-date=May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the statement draws on the 2009 pan-Buddhist statement, "The Time to Act is Now: A Buddhist Declaration on Climate Change," to which SGI-USA among others became a signatory in early-2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=A Buddhist Declaration on Climate Change| url=http://www.ecobuddhism.org/bcp/all_content/buddhist_declaration/| website=Ecological Buddhism: A Buddhist Response to Global Warming| access-date=May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aid work===

The SGI conducts humanitarian aid projects in disaster-stricken regions. After the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan]], local Soka Gakkai facilities became refugee shelters and distribution centers for relief supplies. Efforts also included worldwide fundraising for the victims, youth groups, and spiritual support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panorientnews.com/en/news.php?k=2364l|title=Sendai UN Disaster Panel.|work=Pan Orient News|accessdate=15 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:wo823HsvTAwJ:eprints.soas.ac.uk/13739/1/fisker-Nielsen%2520PROOF2.pdf+&amp;cd=25&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us |title=Grassroot responses to the Tohoku earthquake of 11 March 2011.|work=Anthropology Today Vol. 28, June 2012|accessdate=15 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interfaith dialogue===

In 2015, SGI-USA was part of the organizing committee that convened a day-long conference in Washington, DC of 125 Buddhist leaders to discuss Buddhism and civic activism in the US. The conference identified climate change and the environment, education and peace and disarmament as popular priorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Boorstein |first=Michelle |date=2015-05-12 |title=A political awakening for Buddhists? 125 U.S. Buddhist leaders to meet at the White House |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2015/05/12/125-u-s-buddhist-leaders-to-meet-at-the-white-house/ |work=The Washington Post |access-date=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Synanon''' organization, initially a [[drug rehabilitation]] program, was founded by Charles E. "Chuck" Dederich, Sr., (1913&amp;ndash;1997) in 1958 in [[Santa Monica, California]]. By the early 1960s, Synanon had also become an [[alternative community]], attracting people with its emphasis on living a self-examined life, as aided by group truth-telling sessions that came to be known as the "Synanon Game." Synanon ultimately became the '''Church of Synanon''' in the 1970s, and disbanded permanently in 1991&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2007/08/cult-spawned-tough-love-teen-industry The Cult That Spawned the Tough-Love Teen Industry], ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'', September/October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; due to many criminal activities, including attempted murder of which members were convicted, and legal problems, including losing its tax free status retroactively with the [[United States Internal Revenue Service|Internal Revenue Service]] due to financial misdeeds, destruction of evidence and terrorism.&lt;ref name="longform.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com.ar/search?sourceid=mozclient&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;q=synanon#q=synanon+IRS|title=synanon - Buscar con Google|work=google.com.ar}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been called one of the "most dangerous and violent cults America had ever seen."&lt;ref name="longform.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://paleofuture.gizmodo.com/synanons-sober-utopia-how-a-drug-rehab-program-became-1562665776&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beginnings==
Charles Dederich, a reformed [[alcoholic]] and a member of [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] (A.A.), was said to be an admired speaker at A.A. meetings. Those suffering from addictions to illegal drugs, besides alcohol, were considered to be significantly different from alcoholics, and therefore were not accepted into A.A. Dederich, after taking LSD,&lt;ref name="longform.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://longform.org/posts/the-man-who-fought-the-synanon-cult-and-won|title=Longform: The Man Who Fought the Synanon Cult and Won by Matt Novak|work=Longform}}&lt;/ref&gt; decided to create his own program to respond to their needs. He was said to have coined the phrase "today is the first day of the rest of your life."&lt;ref&gt;Her life with "One Big Brother", [[San Jose Mercury News]], March 19, 1999, Michael D. Clark&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;One big dysfunctional family: A former member of the Synanon cult recalls the "alternative lifestyle" that shaped her, for better and worse, [[Salon Magazine]], March 29, 1999, Fiona Morgan&lt;/ref&gt; After his small group, called "Tender Loving Care," gained a significant following, Dederich [[incorporation (business)|incorporated]] the organization in to the Synanon Foundation in 1958.&lt;ref name="ofshe"&gt;Ofshe, Richard. "The Social Development of the Synanon Cult." Sociological Analysis 41.2 (1980): 109-27. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Synanon is a word of his own invention integrating togetherness (“syn”) with the unknown (“anon”).{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Synanon began as a two-year residential program, but Dederich soon concluded that its members could never graduate, because a full recovery was impossible. The program was based on testimony of fellow group members about their tribulations and urges of relapsing, and the journey to recovery. Synanon differed from Alcoholics Anonymous in that it aided both drug-users and drinkers.The Synanon organization also developed a business that sold promotional items. This became a successful enterprise that for a time generated roughly $10 million per year.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

In 1959, Synanon moved from their small storefront to an [[arsenal|armory]] on the beach. In the early 1960s Charles was able to utilize the media and his Hollywood associates to promote his organization.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} In 1967, Synanon purchased the ''Club Casa del Mar,'' a large beachside hotel in [[Santa Monica, CA|Santa Monica]], and this was used as its headquarters and as a dormitory for those undergoing anti-drug treatment. Later on, Synanon acquired a large building that had been the home of the [[Athens Athletic Club]], in [[Oakland, California]], and then transformed it into a residential facility for Synanon's members.&lt;ref name="janzen"&gt;Janzen, Rod A. The Rise and Fall of Synanon: A California Utopia. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins UP, 2001. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Outsiders were permitted to attend the "Synanon Game" there as well. Children were reared communally in the Synanon School, and juveniles were often ordered to enroll in Synanon by California's courts.

Professionals, even those without drug addictions, were invited to join Synanon. The New York psychiatrist [[Daniel Harold Casriel|Daniel Casriel M.D.]], founder of AREBA (today the oldest surviving private addiction treatment centre in the United States) and cofounder of [[Daytop| Daytop Village]]  (one of the world’s largest therapeutic communities) visited in 1962 and lived there in 1963 and wrote a book about his experiences.&lt;ref&gt;"So Fair A House: The story of Synanon" New York: Prentice-Hall. 1963&lt;/ref&gt; Control over members occurred through the "Game." The "Game" could have been considered to be a therapeutic tool, likened to a form of [[group therapy]]; or else to a form of a "[[social control]]", in which members humiliated one another and encouraged the exposure of one another's innermost weaknesses, or maybe both of these.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20100701135057/http://www.thestraights.com/theprogram/synanon-story2.htm Where did it come from?], Synanon Church and the medical basis for the $traights, or Hoopla in Lake Havasu, by Wes Fager (c) 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the mid-1970s, women in Synanon were required to shave their heads, and married couples were made to break up and take new partners. Men were given forced [[Human sterilization (surgical procedure)|vasectomies]], and a few pregnant women were forced to have [[abortion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arts.ualberta.ca/~skent/Linkedfiles/Cults%20and%20Families.pdf|title=Stephen A.

The film director [[George Lucas]] needed a large group of people with shaved heads for the filming of his movie ''[[THX 1138]]'', and so he hired some of his extras from Synanon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Pollock |first=Dale |authorlink= |coauthors= |others= |title=Skywalking: The Life and Films of George Lucas (p.100) |year=1999 |publisher=Da Capo |location= |isbn=0-306-80904-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Altman]] hired members of Synanon to be extras for the gambling scenes in his movie ''[[California Split]]''.&lt;ref name="reid"&gt;{{cite news

==Practices==

Entrance into the Synanon community required a strong initial commitment. Newcomers were first interviewed by Synanon leadership to gain entrance into the community.&lt;ref name="janzen" /&gt; Upon their arrival, those newcomers are forced to quit using drugs [[cold turkey]], going through [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] within the first few days in the community.&lt;ref name="sternberg"&gt;Sternberg, David. "Synanon House--A Consideration for Its Implications on American Correction." Journal of Criminal Law, Criminology, and Police Science 54.4 (1963): n. pag. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, for their first ninety days in the community, members were expected to cease contact with outside friends and family.&lt;ref name="janzen" /&gt;

During its first decade, Synanon members entered into a 1-2 year program in three stages aimed at preparing members to reenter greater society. During the first stage, members did community and housekeeping labor.  During the second stage, members worked outside of the community but still resided within the community. Finally, during the third stage, members both worked and lived outside of the community, but still attended regular meetings.&lt;ref name="sternberg" /&gt; However, after Synanon's transition into an alternate society in 1968, this program changed to a "lifetime rehabilitation" program, with the premise that drug addicts would never be fully healed enough to return to society.&lt;ref name="ofshe" /&gt;

One of the most distinguishing practices of the Synanon community was a therapeutic practice commonly referred to as "The Game." The game was a session during which one member would talk about themselves and then endure violent criticism by their peers.&lt;ref name="simon"&gt;"Synanon: Toward Building a Humanistic Organization." Journal of Humanistic Psychology 18.3 (1978): 3-20. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; During this practice, members were encouraged to be critical of everything, using critical and profane language.&lt;ref name="janzen" /&gt; However, despite the very aggressive nature of The Game, outside of The Game, members were required to act civilly to each other. While in The Game, members criticized each other, but left as friends and supportive community members.&lt;ref name="simon" /&gt; The Game served not only as Synanon's most prominent form of therapy and personal change, but also worked as a way for leaders to collect the opinions of community members.  Because there was no hierarchy in The Game, members could freely criticize Synanon's highest leadership, who would then take member concerns into consideration when deciding policy.&lt;ref name="janzen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="simon" /&gt;

The game turned into a 72-hour version and was admitted by Dederich to be brainwashing. The game was eventually used to pressure people to Dederich's will, to abort pregnancies, have vasectomies and commit violence.&lt;ref name="longform.org"/&gt;

Chuck Dederich eventually changed his way of thinking about Synanon, and morphed it partially towards a human progressive group. Synanon moved to create schooling for members, and Dederich wanted the members to mentally change for the better of society on the outside. The school was headed by Al Bauman, which believed in innovative philosophy, and aimed to teach children in the same manner to think differently. The school attracted lawyers, screenwriters, business executives, all wanting to educate their children in a progressive environment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Lifetime rehabilitation concept==
Beginning in 1964,&lt;ref name="FBI file"&gt;[https://www.governmentattic.org/10docs/FBIfileSYNANON_1963-1985.pdf], PDF of FBI file at governmentattic.org&lt;/ref&gt; the legal authorities began to investigate Synanon's practices. The concept of "lifetime rehabilitation" did not agree with therapeutic norms, and it was alleged that the Synanon group was running an unauthorized medical clinic. Synanon expanded an old Trans-Pacific Marconi [[RCA]] radio station in [[Tomales Bay]] now [[Marconi Conference Center State Historical Park]]. Furthermore, it was alleged that on remote properties in California such as at [[Marshall, California|Marshall]] in [[Marin County, California|Marin County]] and in [[Badger, Tulare County, California|Badger, Tulare County]], Synanon had erected buildings without the legally-required permits, had created a trash dump, and built an airstrip. Taxation issues also arose. In response to these accusations, Dederich declared that Synanon was a [[tax exemption|tax exempt]] religious organization, the "Church of Synanon."

Legal problems continued, despite this change. Children who had been assigned to Synanon began running away, and an "underground railroad" had been created in the area that sought to help them return to their parents. Beatings of Synanon's opponents and its ex-members, "splittees", occurred across California.  Beatings occurred in Synanon basements.&lt;ref name="longform.org"/&gt; A state [[Grand Jury]] in Marin County issued a scathing report in 1978 that attacked Synanon for the very strong evidence of its [[child abuse]], and also for the monetary profits that flowed to Dederich. The Grand Jury report also rebuked the governmental authorities involved for their lack of oversight, although it stopped short of directly interceding in the Synanon situation.

Though many San Francisco area newspapers and broadcasters covered the Synanon case, they were largely silenced by legal action from Synanon's lawyers, who made claims of libel. These lawsuits ultimately turned out to be a large part of Synanon's undoing, by giving journalists access to Synanon's own internal documents.

== Criminal activity and collapse ==
Synanon has been credited as being involved with several criminal activities, such as the disappearance of Rose Lena Cole around late-1972 or early-1973. Cole had received a court order to enroll in Synanon before she disappeared. She has not been seen or heard from since.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charleyproject.org/cases/c/cole_rose.html Rose Cole's entry on The Charley Project], accessed 20 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Initially Synanon did not support violence, however Dederich later changed the rules to only use violence when needed. Much of the violence by Synanon had been carried out by a group within Synanon called the "Imperial Marines."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,922075,00.html|title=Synanon Sequel|date=1980-07-28|work=Time Magazine|accessdate=2011-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Over 80 violent acts were committed including mass beatings that hospitalized teenagers and ranchers who were beaten in front of their families.&lt;ref name="paulmorantz.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paulmorantz.com/the_synanon_story/the-true-history-of-synanon-violence|title=The True History of Synanon Violence and How it Started|work=paulmorantz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who left the organization were at risk of physical violence for being a "splittee" and one ex-member, Phil Ritter, was beaten so severely that his skull was fractured and he fell into a coma with a near-fatal case of bacterial meningitis.&lt;ref name="Light25th" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5jjcIVYSZx0C&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=synanon+beating+splittee&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wc8Q_92qhz&amp;sig=vRkL5iSuGSpbtiMsYDe3Y1ATFik&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjG1Zb97JPYAhUL4IMKHTTGAtcQ6AEIOTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=synanon%20beating%20splittee&amp;f=false|title=Developing a Christian Worldview of the Problem of Evil|last=Colson|first=Charles W.|last2=Pearcey|first2=Nancy|date=2001|publisher=Tyndale House Publishers, Inc.|year=|isbn=9780842355841|location=|pages=25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.paulmorantz.com/cult/the-history-of-synanon-and-charles-dederich/|title=The History of Synanon and Charles Dederich|website=www.paulmorantz.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the summer of 1978, the ''[[NBC Nightly News]]'' produced a news segment on the controversies surrounding Synanon. Following this broadcast, several executives of the [[NBC]] network and its corporate chairman allegedly received hundreds of threats from Synanon members and supporters.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jack Anderson (columnist)|Jack Anderson]], "NBC Cancelled Jonestown Story", March 20, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; However, NBC continued with a series of reports on the Synanon situation on the ''NBC Nightly News''. The ''[[The Point Reyes Light|Point Reyes Light]]'', a small-circulation weekly newspaper in [[Marin County]], would later receive the [[Pulitzer Prize for Public Service]] for their covering Synanon at a time when other news agencies avoided reporting. Several weeks after NBC began receiving threats, on October 10, 1978, two Synanon members placed a de-rattled [[rattlesnake]] in the mailbox of attorney [[Paul Morantz]] of [[Pacific Palisades, California]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Janzen, Rod A. The Rise and Fall of Synanon, A California Utopia, Johns Hopkins University Press, 2001, p.214&lt;/ref&gt; Morantz had successfully brought suit on behalf of people who were being held against their will by Synanon.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The snake bit him, and he was hospitalized for six days.&lt;ref name="longform.org" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/04/us/charles-dederich-83-synanon-founder-dies.html|title=Charles Dederich, 83, Synanon Founder, Dies|last=Gelder|first=Lawrence Van|date=1997-03-04|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-12-18|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://paleofuture.gizmodo.com/the-man-who-fought-cults-and-won-1634267961&lt;/ref&gt; This incident, along with the press coverage, prompted an investigation by the law and government into Synanon.

Six weeks later, the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] performed a search of the ranch in Badger that found a recorded speech by Dederich in which he said, "We're not going to mess with the old-time, turn-the-other-cheek religious postures... Our religious posture is: Don't mess with us. You can get killed dead, literally dead... These are real threats," he snarled. "They are draining life's blood from us, and expecting us to play by their silly rules. We will make the rules. I see nothing frightening about it... I am quite willing to break some lawyer's legs, and next break his wife's legs, and threaten to cut their child's arm off. That is the end of that lawyer. That is a very satisfactory, humane way of transmitting information. I really do want an ear in a glass of alcohol on my desk."&lt;ref name="Light25th"&gt;Light to celebrate 25th anniversary of its Pulitzer, [[The Point Reyes Light]], April 15, 2004, By Dave Mitchell&lt;/ref&gt; During the investigations searchers also came across multiple lawsuits and arrests against Synanon members.

Dederich was arrested while drunk on December 2, 1978. The two other Synanon residents, one of whom was Lance Kenton, the son of the musician [[Stan Kenton]], pleaded "[[Nolo contendere|no contest]]" to charges of assault, and also conspiracy to commit murder. While his associates went to jail, Dederich got probation because doctors said due to illness he would die in jail.  As part of probation he could not take part in running Synanon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Snake Plot: Dederich Sentenced| url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1314&amp;dat=19800903&amp;id=EltOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wu4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7212,1019836&amp;hl=en.| work = [[The Spokesman-Review]] | date = 1980-09-03| accessdate = 2015-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/09/us/synanon-founder-advocated-violence-against-opponents.html|title=Synanon Founder Advocated Violence Against Opponents|last=Times|first=Special to the New York|date=1982-03-09|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-12-18|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Synanon struggled to survive without its leader, and also with a severely tarnished reputation. The [[Internal Revenue Service]] revoked the organization's tax-exempt status and ordered them to pay $17 million in back taxes, which bankrupted Synanon, which formally dissolved in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Szalavitz, Maia, Help at Any Cost:  How the Troubled-Teen Industry Cons Parents and Hurts Kids, Riverhead Books, 2006, p.33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RnrBO-O_HvcC&amp;pg=PA363&amp;lpg=PA363&amp;dq=synanon+$17+million+in+back+taxes&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OY10owg5cV&amp;sig=BmZXX_iNhP3umpnJzRTk7eXy8_o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-novL8pPYAhVI8IMKHUVIDRwQ6AEIPDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=synanon%20$17%20million%20in%20back%20taxes&amp;f=false|title=Utopias in American History|last=Sreenivasan|first=Jyotsna|date=2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=|isbn=9781598840520|location=|pages=363|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1985-10-02/news/mn-16054_1_tax-exempt-status|title=U.S. Indicts Nine From Synanon in Tax-Exemption Effort|last=OSTROW|first=RONALD J.|date=1985-10-02|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-12-18|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}

== Synanon's influence in the behavior-modification field ==
[[Mel Wasserman]], influenced by his Synanon experience, founded [[CEDU]] Education. CEDU's schools used the confrontation model of Synanon.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.bendbulletin.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20091115/NEWS0107/911150428/1001/NEWS01&amp;nav_category=NEWS01 Ever unconventional, long controversial], By Keith Chu, The Bend Bulletin, November 15, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  The CEDU model was widely influential on the development of parent-choice, private-pay residential programs. People originally inspired by their CEDU experience developed or strongly influenced a significant number of the schools in the [[therapeutic boarding school]] industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strugglingteens.com/artman/publish/article_5922.shtml|title=Out Of The Sixties - Essays|work=strugglingteens.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Father William B. O’Brien, the founder of New York's [[Daytop|Daytop Village]], included Synanon's group encounters and confrontational approach in his research into addiction treatment methods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daytop.org/history.html Daytop History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222234947/http://www.daytop.org/history.html |date=2015-12-22 }}, Daytop Homepage, retrieved 3/25/2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Author, journalist and activist Maia Szalavitz claims to chart the influence of Synanon in other programs including [[Phoenix House]], [[Straight, Incorporated]] and [[Boot camp (correctional)|Boot Camps]] in addition to those mentioned above.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Successes==
Despite its controversies and its downfall, the Synanon program is credited with curing some people of their addictions. For example, Synanon was credited with curing, at least temporarily, the heroin-addicted jazz musicians Frank Rehak, [[Arnold Ross (musician)|Arnold Ross]], [[Joe Pass]], and [[Art Pepper]] (Pepper discussed his Synanon experiences at length in his autobiography ''[[Straight Life (book)|Straight Life]]''), and the actor [[Matthew "Stymie" Beard]]. In 1962, Pass formed a band composed of Synanon patients who recorded an album titled ''[[Sounds of Synanon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jazzguitar.be/joe_pass_licks.html|title=Joe Pass Guitar Licks|work=jazzguitar.be}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Synanon organization was praised by the motivational speaker [[Florrie Fisher]] in her speeches to high school students, and she credited Synanon with curing her of her [[heroin]] addiction. Synanon also inspired the creation of successful programs such as the [[Delancey Street Foundation]], co-founded by John Maher, a former Synanon member. Many former members still value what they see as the positive aspects of Synanon, primarily its strong sense of community, and remain in close contact, in person or through on-line chat groups, and have gone into business together.

A branch of Synanon that was founded in [[Germany]] in 1971 is still in operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.synanon-aktuell.de/|title=Stiftung Synanon - Suchtselbsthilfe Suchthilfegemeinschaft Hilfe bei Suchtproblemen - SYNANON|work=synanon-aktuell.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular depictions==
The 1965 [[Columbia Pictures]] movie ''[[Synanon (film)|Synanon]]'', directed by [[Richard Quine]], was set at (and filmed in) Synanon; it starred [[Edmond O'Brien]] as Chuck Dederich, as well as [[Chuck Connors]], [[Stella Stevens]], [[Richard Conte]], and [[Eartha Kitt]].

The 1968 [[List_of_Mannix_episodes#Season_1_(1967–68)|season 1, episode 22]] of [[Mannix]] features Synanon.

Synanon is referred to in [[Bob Dylan]]'s song "Lenny Bruce", from his album ''[[Shot of Love]]'' (Bruce "never made it to Synanon."). It is also referred to in the song "Opening Doors" from [[Stephen Sondheim]]'s musical ''[[Merrily We Roll Along (musical)|Merrily We Roll Along]]'', which mentions it as a hypothetical song title in a satirical revue of the 1960s.

The 1993 science fiction TV series ''[[Babylon 5]]'' included a version of the Synanon Game in the episodes "[[Signs and Portents]]" and "[[Comes the Inquisitor]]."

The "New-Path" drug treatment centers in science fiction writer [[Philip K. Dick]]'s 1977 novel ''[[A Scanner Darkly]]'' bear numerous similarities to Synanon. Dick's 1981 novel ''[[VALIS]]'' begins with the initial romantic interest committing suicide off of the tenth floor of the Synanon building in [[Oakland, California]].

In [[Charles Alverson]]'s 1977 novel ''Not Sleeping, Just Dead'', private eye Joe Goodey attempts to solve a suspected murder at The Institute, an organization that bears more than a passing resemblance to Synanon. (Alverson had lived in Synanon for six months in 1967 as a straight, or non-addicted, resident.)

Synanon is mentioned in [[Joan Didion]]'s 1979 essay "[[The White Album (book)|The White Album]]".

Many of the extras in the 1971 [[George Lucas]] film ''[[THX 1138]]'' were brought in from the San Francisco-area Synanon chapters. Lucas explains in the DVD commentary, "we were attracted to them simply because everyone who joined this program had to shave their head and we needed hundreds of people with shaved heads for some of the larger scenes in the film." Synanon is thus thanked in the end credits of the movie.

Deborah Swisher, a former Synanon member, recounts her experiences growing up in several Synanon communes in her one-woman show "Hundreds of Sisters and One Big Brother"&lt;ref&gt;https://www.culteducation.com/group/1179-synanon/20120-one-big-dysfunctional-family.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AutelTaurobolique-Lectoure-Aprilis.jpg|thumb|One of the 20 altars in Musée Eugène-Camoreyt in [[Lectoure]] (France)]]
In the [[Roman Empire]] of the second to fourth centuries, '''''taurobolium'''''&lt;ref&gt;[[Franz Cumont]] derived the word from the epithet of ''Artemis Tauropolos'' (whom he identified with Persian [[Anahita]], a connection no longer sustained); see Cumont, "Le Taurobole et le Culte de Bellone", ''Revue d'histoire et de littérature religieuses'', '''6'''.2, 1901.&lt;/ref&gt; referred to practices involving the [[animal sacrifice|sacrifice]] of a [[Bull (mythology)|bull]], which after mid-second century became connected with the worship of the [[Cybele|Great Mother of the Gods]]; though not previously limited to her [[Cult (religion)|cult]], after AD 159 all private ''taurobolia'' inscriptions mention the ''Magna Mater''.&lt;ref&gt;Rutter 2005: Rutter recognises three phases of the ''taurobolium'', a first phase (c. 135–59) in which the ceremony was not linked to the cult of the Great Mother, a second expansive phase (c. 159–290) west of the Adriatic and a brief third phase (c. 376–390) confined to aristocratic pagan circles.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
Originating in [[Asia Minor]],&lt;ref&gt;Rutter 1968, p. 227: "There can be no doubt that the taurobolium originated in Asia Minor"&lt;/ref&gt; its earliest attested performance in Italy occurred in AD 134, at [[Pozzuoli|Puteoli]], in honor of ''[[Venus (mythology)|Venus Caelestis]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Venus Caelestis, by ''[[interpretatio Romana]]'', denoted [[Tanit]], the goddess of [[Carthage]]; her cult statue had been brought to Rome after the destruction of Carthage, but was later returned.&lt;/ref&gt; documented by an inscription.&lt;ref&gt;{{CIL|10|1596}}; inscription quoted by Rutter 1968, p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest inscriptions, of the second century in Asia Minor, point to a bull chase in which the animal was overcome, linked with a ''[[panegyris]]'' in honour of a deity or deities, but not an essentially religious ceremony, though a bull was sacrificed and its flesh distributed. The addition of the  ''taurobolium'' and the institution of an ''[[Galli#Archigallus|archigallus]]'' were innovations in the cult of the Magna Mater made by [[Antoninus Pius]] on the occasion of his ''vicennalia'', the twentieth year of his reign, in 158 and 159.&lt;ref&gt;J. Beaujeu, ''La religion romaine à l'apogée de l'empire'', (Paris) 1955, I. 313 ''ff'', and P. Lambrechts, "Les fêtes 'phrygiennes'  de Cybèle et d'Attis", ''Bulletin de l'Institut Historique Belge de Rome'' (1952) pp 141–70, both noted in Rutter 1968, p. 234 note 26. This was the moment when [[Attis]] first appeared on a Roman coin.&lt;/ref&gt; The first dated reference to Magna Mater in a ''taurobolium'' inscription dates from 160. The ''vires'', or testicles of the bull, were removed from Rome and dedicated at a ''taurobolium'' altar at [[Lugdunum]], 27 November 160. Jeremy Rutter makes the suggestion that the bull's testicles substituted for the self-castration of devotees of Cybele, abhorrent to the Roman ''ethos''.&lt;ref&gt;Rutter 1968, p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt;

Public ''taurobolia'', enlisting the benevolence of the Magna Mater on behalf of the emperor, became common in Italy, as well as in [[Gaul]], [[Hispania]] and [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]]. The last public ''taurobolium'' for which there is an inscription was carried out for Diocletian and Maximian at [[Mactar]] in [[Numidia]] at the close of the third century.

==Description==
The best-known and most vivid description, though of the quite different taurobolium as it was revived in aristocratic pagan circles, is the notorious one that has coloured early scholarship, which was provided in an anti-pagan poem by the late 4th-century Christian [[Prudentius]] in ''[[:la:Prudentii Peristephanon|Peristephanon]]'':&lt;ref&gt;X, ''Romanus contra gentiles'', lines 1006–1085.&lt;/ref&gt; the priest of the Great Mother, clad in a silk toga worn in the [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#cinctus gabinus|Gabinian cincture]], with golden crown and fillets on his head, takes his place in a trench covered by a platform of planks pierced with fine holes, on which a bull, magnificent with flowers and gold, is slain. The blood rains through the platform onto the priest below, who receives it on his face, and even on his tongue and palate, and after the baptism presents himself before his fellow-worshippers purified and regenerated, and receives their salutations and reverence. Prudentius does not explicitly mention the ''taurobolium'', but the ceremony, in its new form, is unmistakable from other contemporaneous sources: "At [[Neuss|Novaesium]] on the Rhine in [[Germania Inferior]], a blood pit was found in what was probably a [[Metroon]]", Jeremy Rutter observes.

Recent scholarship has called into question the reliability of Prudentius' description. It is a late account by a Christian who was hostile to paganism, and may have distorted the rite for effect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/bmcr/2003/2003-02-32.html Antonía Tripolitis, ''Religions of the Hellenistic-Roman Age'' (Grand Rapids, Michigan: Eerdmans) 2002.]&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier inscriptions that mention the rite suggest a less gory and elaborate sacrificial rite. Therefore, Prudentius' description may be based on a late evolution of the ''taurobolium''.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Duthoy, ''The Taurobolium'', Leiden 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==

[[File:Lyon-Autel-CIL-XIII-1756.jpg|thumb|left|Eroded inscription commemorating a taurobolium for the Magna Mater&lt;ref&gt;''CIL'' 13.1756.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The ''taurobolium'' in the second and third centuries was usually performed as a measure for the welfare ''([[salus]])'' of the emperor, Empire, or community; H. Oppermann&lt;ref&gt;Oppermann, in ''RE'' 5A, (1934) s.v. "taurobolium".&lt;/ref&gt; denies early reports that its date was frequently 24 March, the ''[[Cybele#'Holy week' in March|Dies Sanguinis]]'' ("Day of Blood") of the annual festival of the Great Mother [[Cybele]] and Attis; Oppermann reports that there were no ''taurobolia'' in late March. In the late third and the fourth centuries its usual motive was the purification or regeneration of an individual, who was spoken of as ''renatus in aeternum'', "reborn for eternity", in consequence of the ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{CIL|6|510}}, {{CIL|6|511}}, {{CIL|6|512}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While its efficacy was not eternal, its effect was considered to endure for twenty years, as if the magic coating of the blood wore off after that time, the initiate having taken his vows for "the circle of twenty years" (''bis deni orbis'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burkert|first1=Walter|title=Ancient Mystery Cults|date=2001|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0674033876|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also performed as the fulfilment of a vow ''([[votum]])'', or by command of the goddess herself, and the privilege was not limited by sex or class. In its fourth-century revival in high pagan circles, Rutter has observed, "We might even justifiably say that the taurobolium, rather than a rite effectual in itself was a symbol of paganism. It was a rite apparently forbidden by the Christian emperors and thus became a hallmark of the pagan nobility in their final struggle against Christianity and the Christian emperors."&lt;ref&gt;Rutter 1968, p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt; The place of its performance at Rome was near the site of [[Basilica of St. Peter|St Peter's]], in the excavations of which several altars and inscriptions commemorative of ''taurobolia'' were discovered.

A [[criobolium]], substituting a ram for the bull, was also practiced, sometimes together with the ''taurobolium;''.&lt;ref&gt;Rutter 1968, p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern interpretation==
''Encyclopædia Britannica'' 1911, under the influence of Sir [[James George Frazer]]'s ''[[The Golden Bough]]'', suggested "The taurobolium was probably a sacred drama symbolizing the relations of the Mother and Attis (q.v.). The descent of the priest into the sacrificial foss symbolized the death of Attis, the withering of the vegetation of Mother Earth; his bath of blood and emergence the restoration of Attis, the rebirth of vegetation. The ceremony may be the spiritualized descent of the primitive oriental practice of drinking or being baptized in the blood of an animal, based upon a belief that the strength of brute creation could be acquired by consumption of its substance or contact with its blood. In spite of the phrase renatus in aeternum, there is no reason to suppose that the ceremony was in any way borrowed from [[Christianity]]."

'''Tepe Sialk''' ({{lang-fa|تپه سیلک}}) is a large ancient archeological site (a ''tepe'', "hill" or "mound") in a suburb of the city of [[Kashan]], [[Isfahan Province]], in central [[Iran]], close to [[Fin Garden]]. The culture that inhabited this area has been linked to the [[Zayandeh River Culture]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Cultural Heritage Organization of Iran]] (CHN) report: "Zayandeh Rood Civilization Linked to Marvdasht and Sialk". Accessed January 30, 2007. Link: [http://www.chnpress.com/news/?section=2&amp;id=5530 Chnpress.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090209042407/http://www.chnpress.com/news/?section=2&amp;id=5530 |date=2009-02-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Sialk [[ziggurat]] was built around the 3000 BC. A joint study between Iran's Cultural Heritage Organization, the [[Louvre]], and the [[Institut Francais de Recherche en Iran]] also verifies the oldest settlements in Sialk to date back from 6000-5500 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Fazeli, H., Beshkani A., Markosian A., Ilkani H., Young R. L. 2010 The Neolithic to Chalcolithic Transition in the Qazvin Plain, Iran: Chronology and Subsistence Strategies: in Archäologische Mitteilungen Aus Iran and Turan 41, pp. 1-17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, R. and Nashli, H. F., eds. 2013 The Neolithisation of Iran: the formation of new societies. British Association for Near Eastern Archaeology and Oxbow Books, Oxford, pp272.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sialk, and the entire area around it, is thought to have originated as a result of the pristine large water sources nearby that still run today. The Cheshmeh ye Soleiman ("Solomon's Spring") has been bringing water to this area from nearby mountains for thousands of years. The Fin garden, built in its present form in the 17th century, is a popular tourist attraction. It is here that the kings of the [[Safavid]] dynasty would spend their vacations away from their capital cities. It is also here that [[Piruz Nahavandi]] (Abu-Lu'lu'ah), the Persian assassin of [[Caliph]] [[Umar]], is buried. All these remains are located in the same location where Sialk is.

==Archaeology==
Tepe Sialk was excavated  for three seasons (1933, 1934, and 1937) by a team headed by [[Roman Ghirshman]] and his wife [[Tania Ghirshman]].&lt;ref&gt;Roman Ghirshman, ''Fouilles de Sialk près de Kashan'', 1933, 1934, 1937, vol. 1, Paul Geuthner, 1938&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ghirshman, ''Fouilles de Sialk'', vol. 2, Paul Geuthner, 1939&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.brown.edu/Research/Breaking_Ground/bios/Ghirshman_Tania.pdf|title=Ghirshman, Tania|last=Spyoket|first=Agnès|date=|website=Breaking Ground: Women in Old World Archaeology|publisher=Brown University|others=Translated by Sylvie Marshall|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Studies related to the site were conducted by D.E.&amp;nbsp;McCown, Y.&amp;nbsp;Majidzadeh, and P.&amp;nbsp;Amieh.&lt;ref&gt;D. E. McCown, ''The Comparative Stratigraphy of Early Iran'', Studies in Ancient Oriental Civilization no. 23, Oriental Institute of Chicago, 1942&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yousef Majidzadeh, ''Correction of the Internal Chronology for the Sialk III Period on the Basis of the Pottery Sequence at Tepe Ghabristan, Iran'', vol. 16, pp. 93-101, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; 
Excavation was resumed for several seasons between 1999 
and 2004 by a team from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and [[Iran's Cultural Heritage Organization]] led by [[Sadegh Malek Shahmirzadi]] called the Sialk Reconsideration Project.&lt;ref&gt;S.M.

Iranian Cultural Heritage Organization, 2005, (Persian)&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2008 an Iranian team led by Hassan Fazeli Nashli and supported by Robin Coningham of the [[University of Durham]] have worked at the northern mound finding 6 Late Neolithic burials. &lt;ref&gt;[http://anthropology.uw.edu.pl/04/bne-04-09.pdf]A. Sołtysiak and H. Fazeli Nashli, Short Fieldwork Report: Tepe Sialk (Iran), seasons 2008–2009, Bioarchaeology of the Near East, vol. 4, pp.69–73, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Artifacts from the original dig ended up mostly at the [[Louvre]], while some can be found at the [[British Museum]], the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York, and the [[National Museum of Iran]] and in the hands of private collectors.

These artifacts consisted of some very fine painted potteries.&lt;ref name=Langer&gt;{{cite book|title=An Encyclopedia of World History| editor-last = Langer | editor-first = William L. |edition = 5th | publisher = Houghton Mifflin Company| location = Boston, MA| year = 1972 | isbn = 0-395-13592-3|pages = 17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Northern mound==
The northern mound (tell) is the oldest; the occupation dates back to the end of the seventh millennium BC. The mound is composed of two levels: Sialk I (the oldest), and Sialk II.

Sialk I level architecture is pretty rudimentary. Tombs containing pottery have been uncovered. The ceramic is initially rather rough, then becomes of better quality with the time.&lt;ref&gt;''Les Recherches Archéologiques Françaises en Iran''. Novembre 2001, Téhéran. Institut Français de Recherche en Iran, Musee du Louvre, ICHO&lt;/ref&gt;

''Zagheh archaic painted ware'' (ca. 6000-5500 BC) is found in Tepe Sialk I, sub-levels 1-2. This is the early painted ware, that was first excavated at [[Teppe Zagheh|Tepe Zagheh]] in the Qazvin plain.&lt;ref&gt;Robert H. Dyson (2011), [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ceramics-i CERAMICS: The Neolithic Period through the Bronze Age in Northeastern and North-central Persia.] iranicaonline.org&lt;/ref&gt;

In sub-periods 3, 4 and 5, the pottery has a clear surface with painted decoration. Stone or bone tools are still used.

The Sialk II level sees the first appearance of metallurgy. The archaeological material found in the buildings of this period testifies to increasing links with the outside world.

==Southern mound==
The south tell includes the Sialk III and IV levels. The first, divided into seven sub-periods, corresponds to the fifth millennium and the beginning of the fourth (c. 4000 BC). This period is in continuity with the previous one, and sees the complexity of architecture (molded bricks, use of stone) and crafts, especially metallurgical.

===Metallurgy===
Evidence demonstrates that Tepe Sialk was an important metal production center in central Iran during the Sialk III and Sialk IV periods. A significant amount of metallurgical remains were found during the excavations in the 1990s and later. This includes large amounts of slag pieces, litharge cakes, and crucibles and moulds.&lt;ref&gt;Nezafati N, Pernicka E, Shahmirzadi SM. [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236888140_Evidence_on_the_Ancient_Mining_and_Metallurgy_at_Tappeh_Sialk_Central_Iran Evidence on the ancient mining and metallurgy at Tappeh Sialk (Central Iran)] In: Yalcin U, Özbal H, Pasamehmetoglu HG, editors. Ancient Mining in Turkey and the Eastern Mediterranean. Ankara: Atilim University; 2008. p. 329–349. researchgate.net&lt;/ref&gt;

Sialk IV level begins in the second half of the fourth millennium, and ends with the abandonment of the site at the beginning of the third millennium. For the oldest sub-periods of the Sialk IV, there are links with the [[Mesopotamia]]n civilizations of [[Uruk]] and [[Jemdet Nasr]].

[[File:Economic tablet Susa Louvre Sb3047.jpg|thumb|Economic tablet with numeric signs. Proto-Elamite script in clay, [[Susa]], [[Uruk period]] (3200 BC to 2700 BC). Department of Oriental Antiquities, [[Louvre]].]]
Later on, the material is similar to that of [[Susa]] III ([[Proto-Elamite]] level), so this is where the Proto-Elamite horizon at Sialk is located, as is also evidenced by the discovery here of some Proto-Elamite clay tablets.

The ruins of what would be the oldest Ziggurat in the world are found at this same Sialk IV level.

==Second millennium BC==
After an abandonment of more than a millennium, the Sialk site is reoccupied in the second half of the second millennium. This last phase of occupation of the site is divided into two periods: Sialk V and Sialk VI. The archaeological material of these two levels has been mostly found in the two necropolises, called necropolis A and necropolis B.

The first represents the Sialk V level. Here are found weapons and other objects in bronze, as well as jewelry, and some iron items. The ceramic is gray-black, or red, sometimes with some decorations that consist of geometric patterns, and can be compared to items coming from the sites in [[Gorgan]] valley (the later levels of [[Tureng Tepe]], and [[Tepe Hissar]]).

'''''The Varieties of Religious Experience: A Study in Human Nature''''' is a book by [[Harvard University]] psychologist and philosopher [[William James]]. It comprises his edited [[Gifford Lectures]] on [[natural theology]], which were delivered at the [[University of Edinburgh]] in Scotland in 1901 and 1902. The lectures concerned the nature of religion and the neglect of science in the academic study of religion.

Soon after its publication, ''Varieties'' entered the [[Western canon]] of psychology and philosophy and has remained in print for over a century.

James later developed his philosophy of [[pragmatism]]. There are many overlapping ideas in ''Varieties'' and his 1907 book, ''Pragmatism''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Poole|first=Randall A | chapter = William James in the Moscow Psychological Society | title = William James in Russian Culture | editor1-first = Joan DeLaney | editor1-last = Grossman | editor2-first = Ruth | editor2-last = Rischin|year=2003|publisher=Lexington Books | location =Lanham MD|isbn=978-0739105269|page =143|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Rwdz4eU8VKkC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious experiences==
James was most interested in direct religious experiences. Theology and the organizational aspects of religion were of secondary interest. He believed that religious experiences were simply human experiences: "Religious happiness is happiness. Religious trance is trance."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VPVvBgAAQBAJ|title=The Varieties of Religious Experience (Annotated)|last=James|first=William|date=1913-01-01|publisher=Longmans, Green, and Company|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He believed that religious experiences can have "morbid origins"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HNTcr6E83YIC|title=Psychology and Religion: Eight Points of View|last=Fuller|first=Andrew Reid|date=1994-01-01|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=9780822630364|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; in brain pathology and can be irrational but nevertheless are largely positive. Unlike the bad ideas that people have under the influence of a high fever, after a religious experience the ideas and insights usually remain and are often valued for the rest of the person's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-LhkseyUMgAC&amp;pg=PR34&amp;lpg=PR34&amp;dq=%25E2%2580%259Chigh+fever%25E2%2580%259D+william+james+varieties+of+religious&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hu4vUW-jw4&amp;sig=Ase-dVOwJOYK5xDTO4qTJ7la7gI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=l0QPVfj8ComYNpewg2g&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=feverish%2520fancies&amp;f=false|title=The Varieties of Religious Experience|last=James|first=William|date=1985-01-01|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674932258|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under James’ [[pragmatism]], the effectiveness of religious experiences proves their truth, whether they stem from religious practices or from drugs: "[[Nitrous oxide]] ... stimulate[s] the mystical consciousness in an extraordinary degree."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AInm-3hXfo0C&amp;pg=PA95&amp;lpg=PA95&amp;dq=Nitrous+oxide+and+ether,+especially+nitrous+oxide,+when+sufficiently+diluted+with+air,+stimulate+the+mystical+consciousness+in+an+extraordinary+degree.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wYPg09a2Rj&amp;sig=8u9wBRE49J4_nhqlziMv47kpOwg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HEYPVZLLJ4PugwSLnYHACw&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Nitrous%2520oxide%2520and%2520ether%252C%2520especially%2520nitrous%2520oxide%252C%2520when%2520sufficiently%2520diluted%2520with%2520air%252C%2520stimulate%2520the%2520mystical%2520consciousness%2520in%2520an%2520extraordinary%2520degree.&amp;f=false|title=The Highlights of William James towards Spiritual Recovery from Addictions Taken from the "Varieties of Religious Experience": A most ideal reading for those experiencing difficulty with the Spiritual Aspect of the 12 step program to the Recovery of Happiness|last=G|first=Jim|date=2011-04-29|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=9781456768799|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James had relatively little interest in the legitimacy or illegitimacy of religious experiences. Further, despite James' examples being almost exclusively drawn from [[Christianity]], he did not mean to limit his ideas to any single religion. Religious experiences are something that people sometimes have under certain conditions. In James' description, these conditions are likely to be psychological or pharmaceutical rather than cultural.

==Existential judgment vs. proposition of value==

James believed that the origins of a religion shed little light upon its value. There is a distinction between an existential judgment (a judgment on "constitution, origin, and history") and a proposition of value (a judgment on "importance, meaning, or significance").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=James |first=William |edition= |editor= |date=1987 |title=The Varieties of Religious Experience |page=13 |location= |publisher=[[The Library of America]] |isbn=978-0-940450-38-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, if the founder of the [[Quakers|Quaker religion]], [[George Fox]], had been a hereditary degenerate, the Quaker religion could yet be "a religion of veracity rooted in spiritual inwardness, and a return to something more like the original gospel truth than men had ever known in England."

Furthermore, the potentially dubious psychological origins of religious beliefs apply just as well to non-religious beliefs:
{{Quotation |Scientific theories are organically conditioned just as much as religious emotions are; and if we only knew the facts intimately enough, we should doubtless see "the [[liver]]" determining the dicta of the sturdy atheist as decisively as it does those of the Methodist under conviction anxious about his soul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=James |first=William |edition= |editor= |date=1987 |title=The Varieties of Religious Experience |page=21 |location= |publisher=[[The Library of America]] |isbn=978-0-940450-38-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Reality of the unseen==

James criticized scientists for ignoring unseen aspects of the universe. Science studies some of reality, but not all of it:

{{Quotation |Vague impressions of something indefinable have no place in the rationalistic system.... Nevertheless, if we look on man's whole mental life as it exists ..., we have to confess that the part of it of which rationalism can give an account of is relatively superficial. It is the part that has the prestige undoubtedly, for it has the loquacity, it can challenge you for proofs, and chop logic, and put you down with words.... Your whole subconscious life, your impulses, your faiths, your needs, your divinations, have prepared the premises, of which your consciousness now feels the weight of the result; and something in you absolutely knows that that result must be truer than any logic-chopping rationalistic talk, however clever, that may contradict it.&lt;ref name="Mounce2002"&gt;{{citation|author=Howard Mounce|title=The Two Pragmatisms: From Peirce to Rorty|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zeCEAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA106|date=22 January 2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-74343-8|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=="Healthy mindedness" vs. "the sick soul"==
James saw "healthy mindedness" as America’s main contribution to religion. This is the religious experience of [[optimism]] and positive thinking which James sees running from the [[Transcendentalism|transcendentalists]] [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]] and [[Walt Whitman|Whitman]] to [[Mary Baker Eddy]]'s [[Christian Science]]. At the extreme, the "healthy minded" see sickness and evil as an illusion. James considered belief in the "mind cure" to be reasonable when compared to [[medicine]] as practiced at the beginning of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duclow|first=Donald F.|date=2002-01-01|title=William James, Mind-Cure, and the Religion of Healthy-Mindedness|jstor=27511579|journal=Journal of Religion and Health|volume=41|issue=1|pages=45–56|doi=10.2307/27511579}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "sick souls" ("morbid-mindedness" / the "twice born") are merely those who hit bottom before their religious experience; those whose redemption gives relief from the pains they suffered beforehand. By contrast, the "healthy minded" deny the need for such preparatory pain or suffering. James believes that "morbid-mindedness ranges over the wider scale of experience" and that while healthy-mindedness is a surprisingly effective "religious solution",

{{Quote |"healthy-mindedness is inadequate as a philosophical doctrine, because the evil facts which it refuses positively to account for are a genuine portion of reality; and they may after all be the best key to life’s significance, and possibly the only openers of our eyes to the deepest levels of truth."}}

James sees the two types as being a mere matter of temperament: the healthy minded having a "constitutional incapacity for prolonged suffering"; the morbid minded being those prone to "religious melancholia".

==Saintliness==
For James, a [[saint]]ly character is one where "spiritual emotions are the habitual centre of the personal energy." &lt;br&gt;
James states that saintliness includes:

{{Quote |sign=|source=|"1. A feeling of being in a wider life than that of this world's selfish little interests; and a conviction … of the existence of an Ideal Power.&lt;br&gt;
2. A sense of the friendly continuity of the ideal power with our own life, and a willing self-surrender to its control.&lt;br&gt;
3. An immense elation and freedom, as the outlines of the confining selfhood melt down.&lt;br&gt;
4. A shifting of the emotional Centre towards loving and harmonious affections, towards "yes, yes" and away from "no," where the claims of the non-ego are concerned."}}

For James the practical consequences of saintliness are [[asceticism]] (pleasure in sacrifice), strength of soul (a "blissful equanimity" free from anxieties), purity (a withdrawal from the material world), and charity (tenderness to those most would naturally disdain).

==Mysticism==
James identified two main features to a [[mystical experience]]:

{{Quote |sign=|source=|[[Ineffability]] —" no adequate report of its contents can be given in words. […] its quality must be directly experienced; it cannot be imparted or transferred to others. […]  mystical states are more like states of feeling than like states of intellect. No one can make clear to another who has never had a certain feeling, in what the quality or worth of it consists."

[[Noesis|Noetic]] quality —"Although so similar to states of feeling, mystical states seem to those who experience them to be also states of knowledge. They are states of insight into depths of truth unplumbed by the discursive intellect. They are illuminations, revelations, full of significance and importance, all inarticulate though they remain; and as a rule they carry with them a curious sense of authority for after-time."}}

He also identified two subsidiary features that are often, but not always, found with mystical experiences:

{{Quote |sign=|source=|Transiency —"Mystical states cannot be sustained for long."

Passivity —"the mystic feels as if his own will were in abeyance, and indeed sometimes as if he were grasped and held by a superior power."}}

==Reception==
The August 1902 ''New York Times'' review of the first edition ends with the following:

{{Quotation|Everywhere there is a frolic welcome to the eccentricities and extravagances of the religious life.  Many will question whether its more sober exhibitions would not have been more fruitful of results, but the interest and fascination of the treatment are beyond dispute, and so, too, is the sympathy to which nothing human is indifferent.&lt;ref name= "nyt1902"&gt;{{cite web| url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D0CE5DA113DEE32A2575AC0A96E9C946397D6CF | title = A Study of Man: ''The Varieties of Religious Experience''|work= The New York Times | date= August 9, 1902 | accessdate=2010-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A July 1963 ''Time'' magazine review of an expanded edition published that year ends with quotes about the book from Peirce and Santayana:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,896918,00.html | title = Books: The Waterspouts of God | publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date=July 19, 1963| accessdate = 2010-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|In making little allowance for the fact that people can also be converted to vicious creeds, he acquired admirers he would have deplored. [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]], for instance, hailed James as a preceptor who had showed him that "an action should be judged by its result rather than by its doctrinary basis." James ... had no intention of giving comfort to latter-day totalitarians. He was simply impatient with his fellow academicians and their endless hairsplitting over matters that had no relation to life. A vibrant, generous person, he hoped to show that religious emotions, even those of the deranged, were crucial to human life. The great virtue of ''The Varieties'', noted pragmatist philosopher [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Charles Peirce]], is its "penetration into the hearts of people." Its great weakness, retorted [[George Santayana]], is its "tendency to disintegrate the idea of truth, to recommend belief without reason and to encourage superstition."}}

'''''The Almost Complete Collection of True Singapore Ghost Stories''''' (also ''True Singapore Ghost Stories'' or ''TSGS'') is one of the bestselling book series in [[Singapore]]. With over 1.5 million copies sold,{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} the series has become a household name since its inception in 1989. [[Russell Lee (writer)|Russell Lee]], a Singaporean author, compiles reports, stories and interviews about the supernatural. Light and entertaining, each book, which comprises about 30 stories, appeals to both children and mature readers.

Most of the stories take place in [[Asia]] but some take place in other parts of the world.

He is banished from [[Kur]] by the immortal survivor of the flood [[Utnapishtim]] for no discernible reason, possibly for conveying Gilgamesh across the Hubur.

{{Refimprove|date=September 2014}}
'''''Vāticinium ex ēventū''''' ({{IPA-la|vatiˈtʃini.um ɛks eˈvɛntu|church}}, "prophecy from the event") is a technical [[theology|theological]] or [[historiography|historiographical]] term referring to a [[prophecy]] written after the author already had information about the events being "foretold". The text is written so as to appear that the prophecy had taken place before the event, when in fact it was written after the events supposedly predicted. ''Vaticinium ex eventu'' is a form of [[hindsight bias]]. The concept is similar but distinct from [[postdiction]], where prophecies that were genuinely written or spoken before the event are reinterpreted after the event to fit the facts as they occurred.

==Examples==

===In religious writings===

The Babylonian "[[Marduk]] Prophecy", a text describing the travels of the Marduk idol from [[Babylon]], "prophesies" of the statue’s seizure during the sack of the city by [[Mursilis I]] in 1531 BC, [[Assyria]], when [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]] overthrew [[Kashtiliash IV]] in 1225 BC and took the idol to [[Assur]], and [[Elam]], when Kudur-nahhunte ransacked the city and pilfered the statue around 1160 BC. A copy&lt;ref&gt;Tablet K. 2158+&lt;/ref&gt; was found in the House of the Exorcist at Assur, whose contents date from 713–612 BC and is closely related thematically to another ''vaticinium ex eventu'' text called the Shulgi prophecy, which probably followed it in a sequence of tablets. Both compositions present a favorable view of Assyria.

As we see in Daniel 7:2–11:39, especially Daniel 11, the [[Book of Daniel]] utilizes ''vaticinium ex eventu'', by its seeming foreknowledge of events from Alexander's conquest up to the persecution of Antiochus IV in the summer of 164 BCE. However, Daniel knows neither about the re-dedication of the Temple (1 Maccabees 4:52–54) nor about Antiochus's death, both of which happened late in November and December of 164 BCE. Therefore, Daniel 11:40–12:3 is no longer vaticina ex eventu but genuine predictive prophecy.&lt;ref&gt;Ehling, Untersuchungen zur Geschichte der späten Seleukiden, 111, esp. fn 1; D. Gera, Dov and W. Horowitz, "Antiochus IV in Life and Death: Evidence from the Babylonian Astronomical Diaries", JAOS 117 (1997): 240-52; J. J. Collins, Daniel: A Commentary on the Book of Daniel (Hermeneia; Minneapolis, MN: Augsburg Press), 388--389 {{cite book|title=The Book of Daniel: Composition and Reception|volume=1|editor= John Joseph Collins, Peter W. Flint|location=Leiden &amp; Boston|publisher=Brill|year=2001|series=supplements to Vetus Testamentum ( vol. 83)|isbn=9004226753|author=Lester L. Grabbe|chapter=A Dan(iel) For All Seasons}} page 230.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern scholarship considers the stories of the first half legendary in origin, and the visions of the second the product of anonymous authors in the [[Maccabees|Maccabean]] period (2nd century BCE).{{sfn|Collins|2002|p=2}} Its inclusion in [[Ketuvim]] (Writings) rather than [[Nevi'im]] (Prophets) was likely because it appeared after the canon for those books had closed, and the dominant view among Jews and scholars is that Daniel is not in any case a prophetic book but an [[apocalypse]]. However, in the Christian canon Daniel is listed under the [[Major Prophets]].

Some scholars regard statements attributed to [[Jesus]] in the [[Gospels]] that foretell the destruction of Jerusalem and its temple as examples of ''vaticinia ex eventu'', these scholars believe that the Gospels were all written after [[siege of Jerusalem (AD 70)|the siege of Jerusalem in AD 70]], in which the temple was destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Soulen|first1=Richard N.|last2=Soulen|first2=R. Kendall|title=Handbook of Biblical Criticism|date=2001|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=9780664223144|page=204|edition=3rd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ooGh9TTe0jUC&amp;dq=vaticinium+ex+eventu&amp;q=vaticinium#v=snippet&amp;q=vaticinium&amp;f=false|accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However some Christian scholars reject this notion as the fulfillment of the acclaimed prophecy; the destruction of the temple is not recorded in the gospels or in the other letters and date the new testament scriptures before AD 70.

===Secular===
*The Ancient world saw the technique of ''vaticinium ex eventu'' used by a wide variety of figures, from [[Pindar]] and [[Herodotus]] to [[Horace]] and [[Virgil]].&lt;ref&gt;JJ O'Hara, ''Death and the Optimistic Prophecy in Vergil's Aeneid'' (2014) p. 128-9&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Divine Comedy]] by [[Dante Alighieri]] includes a number of such prophecies of Dante's own exile from Florence. 
*In [[Jerusalem Delivered]], [[Torquato Tasso]] uses the ''vaticinium ex eventu'' trope in presaging the discovery of America by [[Christopher Columbus]]: "Un uom de la Liguria avrà ardimento / a l'incognito corso esporsi in prima" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tasso|first1=Torquato|title=Gerusalemme Liberata|date=1971|publisher=Einaudi|location=Turin|page=459}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*References in the late correspondence of [[Virginia Woolf]] to "how I love this savage medieval water ... and myself so eliminated"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in H. Lee, ''Virginia Woolf'' (1996) p. 752&lt;/ref&gt; are sometimes taken as presaging her suicide by drowning a few months later: the danger of ''vaticinium ex eventu'' has however also been observed.&lt;ref&gt;Olivia Laing, ''To the River'' (2011) p. 195-8&lt;/ref&gt;

The book '''''Waking Up: A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion''''' (2014) by [[Sam Harris]] discusses a wide range of topics including [[secular spirituality]] (essentially within the context of [[spiritual naturalism]]), the illusion of the [[self]], [[psychedelic drug|psychedelics]], and [[meditation]]. He attempts to show that a certain form of spirituality is integral to understanding the nature of the [[mind]]. In late September 2014, the book reached #5 on the ''[[New York Times]]'' Non-Fiction Best Sellers list.&lt;ref name="brightsight"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sam Harris’ Waking Up a Top 5 New York Times Best Seller|url=http://brightsightgroup.com/sam-harris-waking-top-5-new-york-times-best-seller/|website=BrightSight Group|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harris' podcast subsequently adopted the title ''Waking Up''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Podcast|url=https://www.samharris.org/podcast|website=samharris.org|publisher=[[Sam Harris]]|accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
===Role of spirituality===
Harris rejects the dichotomy between religious spirituality on the one hand and scientific rationality on the other, and seeks to define a middle path that preserves spirituality and science but does not involve religion.&lt;ref name="clothier"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clothier|first1=Peter|title='Waking Up', by Sam Harris: A Book Review|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/waking-up-by-sam-harris-a_b_8079028.html|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=1 October 2017|date=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He writes that spirituality should be understood in light of scientific disciplines like [[neuroscience]] and [[psychology]].&lt;ref name="clothier"/&gt; Science, he contends, can show how to maximize human well-being but may fail to answer certain questions about the nature of being, answers to some of which he says are discoverable directly through our experience.&lt;ref name="clothier"/&gt; His conception of spirituality does not involve a belief in God.&lt;ref name="h-smith"/&gt;

Harris' treatment of the nature of the mind draws on psychology, [[split-brain]] scientific literature, and [[philosophy of mind]].&lt;ref name="kirkus"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Waking Up: A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion |work=[[Kirkus Reviews]] |date=August 29, 2014 |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/sam-harris/waking-up-guide-to-spirituality/ |accessdate=August 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He explores various positions on the [[mind-body problem]] but states that the solution may lie beyond the capabilities of human reason.&lt;ref name="tquirk"&gt;{{cite web |last=Quirk |first=Trevor |title=I Thought I Hated the New Atheists. Then I Read Sam Harris's New Book. |work=[[The New Republic]] |date=September 10, 2014  |url=https://newrepublic.com/article/119397/sam-harriss-waking-review |accessdate=August 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harris writes that the purpose of spirituality (as he defines it – he says the term's uses are diverse and sometimes indefensible) is to become aware that our sense of self is illusory, and says that this realization brings both happiness and insight into the nature of [[consciousness]].&lt;ref name="clothier"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kirkus"/&gt; He says spiritual discipline allows us to repeatedly recognize in our day-to-day lives that there is no self.&lt;ref name="clothier"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tquirk"/&gt; Instead, there is an apprehension of "pure consciousness," a profoundly peaceful state independent of any sense experience.&lt;ref name="tquirk"/&gt; He argues this process of realization is based on experience and is not contingent on [[faith]].&lt;ref name="clothier"/&gt;

===Meditation and experiences===
Harris provides brief guidance on how to meditate, and directs readers to his website for more in-depth instructions.&lt;ref name="kirkus"/&gt; He has studied under several Eastern meditation teachers, and gives advice on how to identify a good spiritual teacher.&lt;ref name="h-smith"/&gt; He describes his experience with [[Dzogchen]], a [[Tibetan Buddhist]] practice, and recommends it to his readers.&lt;ref name="clothier"/&gt;

Although Harris assigns great value to [[religious experiences]], he argues that facts about the cosmos and particular religious dogmas cannot reasonably be inferred from these experiences.&lt;ref name="bruni"&gt;{{cite web |last=Bruni |first=Frank |authorlink=Frank Bruni |title=Between Godliness and Godlessness |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 30, 2014  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/31/opinion/sunday/frank-bruni-between-godliness-and-godlessness.html |accessdate=October 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this vein, he describes some of his own deep spiritual experiences, but does not interpret them as evidence, for instance, of [[Christian]], [[Hindu]], or [[Buddhist]] metaphysics, as he says adherents of those religions likely would.&lt;ref name="h-smith"/&gt; He defends a segment of English spiritual author [[Douglas Harding]]'s book ''On Having No Head'' against the sharp criticisms of neuroscientist [[Douglas Hofstadter]]. By contrast, he criticizes [[Eben Alexander (author)|Eben Alexander]]'s Christian interpretation of a [[near-death experience]] in ''[[Proof of Heaven]]'' at length as filled with unwarranted assumptions.&lt;ref name="tquirk"/&gt;

==Reception==
''Waking Up'' has been praised by literary critics.  [[Frank Bruni]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, "Harris's book [...] caught my eye because it's so entirely of this moment, so keenly in touch with the growing number of Americans who are willing to say that they do not find the succor they crave, or a truth that makes sense to them, in organized religion."&lt;ref name="bruni"/&gt; He notes that since publishing ''[[The End of Faith]]'' in 2004, Harris has shifted focus to some extent from criticizing religion to trying to understand what people seek in religion and arguing these benefits are possible without it.&lt;ref name="bruni"/&gt;

Stephen Cave of the ''[[Financial Times]]'' similarly described ''Waking Up'' as "a fine book" and observed, "although it portrays only a fragment of the emerging picture of post-Christian spirituality, it nonetheless does so with great colour and clarity – like a shining stained glass window for a church that is still being built."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cave |first=Stephen |title='Waking Up: A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion', by Sam Harris |work=[[Financial Times]] |date=October 31, 2014  |url=https://www.ft.com/content/1d3edaaa-5df4-11e4-b7a2-00144feabdc0 |accessdate=August 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' called it "A demanding, illusion-shattering book certain to receive criticism from both the scientific and the religious camps."&lt;ref name="kirkus"/&gt; Peter Clothier, writing for the ''[[Huffington Post]]'', described it as "an immensely readable and enjoyable book. Harris writes about the profound issues that affect our lives with clarity, and with occasional humor."&lt;ref name="clothier"/&gt;

It received a more mixed response from Trevor Quirk of ''[[The New Republic]]'', who criticized what he perceived as the book's inconsistencies and Harris's willingness to belittle religious people.  He nevertheless wrote, "[Harris's] new book, whether discussing the poverty of spiritual language, the neurophysiology of consciousness, psychedelic experience, or the quandaries of the self, at the very least acknowledges the potency and importance of the religious impulse—though Harris might name it differently—that fundamental and common instinct to seek not just an answer to life, but a way to ''live'' that answer."&lt;ref name="tquirk"/&gt; Likewise, the ''Washington Independent Review of Books''' Holly Smith writes, "Overall, Harris’ book has much to recommend it, but not so much that it should be anyone’s first stop on the road to secular spirituality."&lt;ref name="h-smith"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Holly|title=Waking Up: A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion|url=http://www.washingtonindependentreviewofbooks.com/bookreview/executive-director-at-the-common-good|publisher=Washington Independent Review of Books|accessdate=2 October 2017|date=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
