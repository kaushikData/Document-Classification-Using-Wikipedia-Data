'''Advocacy evaluation''', also called '''public policy advocacy design, monitoring, and evaluation''', [[Program evaluation|evaluates]] the progress or outcomes of [[advocacy]], such as changes in [[public policy]]. This is different from [[policy analysis]], which generally looks at the results of the policy, or mainstream [[program evaluation]], which assesses whether programs or direct services have been successful. Advocacy strives to influence a program or policy either directly or indirectly; therefore, the influence is being evaluated, rather than the results of that influence. Advocacy evaluators seek to understand the extent to which advocacy efforts have contributed to the advancement of a goal or policy. They do this in order to learn what works, what does not, and what works better in order to achieve advocacy goals and improve future efforts.

==Goals of advocacy (dependent variables)==
In order to evaluate something, one must know the goals of the program/activity, in this case - advocacy efforts.  Policy advocacy evaluation focuses on the contribution towards achieving policy, and not on the results of that policy. Policy advocacy evaluators look at these dependent variables (many of which interrelate significantly with movement in the [[policy cycle]]):

Intermediate Goal Examples:
* Increased awareness of constituents about the need for policy (Problem Identification -&gt; Agenda Setting)
* Change in rate of key-words use by politicians, sometimes starting from 0 (Problem Identification -&gt; Agenda Setting)
* Increase in ratio of policy being implemented according to the adopted legislation (Adoption-&gt;Implementation)
* Developed capacity of advocacy actor or network of actors to conduct advocacy efforts
Ultimate Goals
* Policy change itself in the desired direction (of the [[policy cycle]]). This is the highest level intermediate outcome, and as an inherent best practice, is the goal of most policy advocacy efforts.  Policy Advocacy works to move a policy through the [[policy cycle]].

==Distinct challenges of advocacy evaluation==
* Contribution vs. attribution: Since multiple actors campaign simultaneously for and against any given policy, it is difficult to ascertain attribution. Evaluating contributions is preferred in this case as it allows multiple actors to influence the degree of success.
* Long term nature of advocacy: Since many advocacy goals are long term, measuring impact can be a challenge. Instead, outcomes, interim progress, and intermediary goals are the preferred measures of influence.
* Shifting strategies: Since the context that advocates work within is ever-changing, advocates adapt their strategies, which creates a difficult environment in which to monitor progress.
* Complexity and theories of change: logic models and theories of change for advocacy campaigns are inherently complex; for example: protests+lobbying+media campaigns -&gt; contribution to policy change. These kinds of theories of change have so many layers, nuances, and uncontrollable factors to them that intra and inter organizational agreement is difficult, making strategic planning, and evaluation all the more challenging.

==Typology of policy advocacy==
Direct Advocacy 
(Directly trying to influence policy makers):
* [[Lobbying]] (also known as direct lobbying) is the act of attempting to influence decisions made by government officials, most often legislators or members of regulatory agencies. Various people or groups, from private-sector individuals or corporations, fellow legislators or government officials, or advocacy groups use lobbying.
Indirect Advocacy 
(Indirectly influencing policymakers by getting their constituents to advocate):
* [[Grassroots lobbying]] (also known as indirect lobbying) is a form of lobbying that focuses on raising awareness of a particular cause at the local level, with the intention of reaching the legislature and making a difference in the decision-making process. Grassroots lobbying is an approach that separates itself from direct lobbying through the act of asking the public to contact legislators and government officials concerning the issue at hand, as opposed to conveying the message to the legislators directly.
* [[Activism]] consists of intentional efforts to promote or prevent social, political, economic, or environmental change. Activism can take a wide range of forms including, from writing letters to newspapers or politicians, political campaigning, economic activism such as boycotts or preferentially patronizing businesses, rallies, street marches, strikes, sit-ins, and hunger strikes.
* [[Astroturfing]] supports political, organizational, or corporate agendas, and is designed to give the appearance of a "grassroots" movement. The goal of such campaigns is to disguise the efforts of a political and/or commercial entity as an independent public reaction to some political entity—a politician, political group, product, service, or event.

==Examples of Advocacy Evaluation==
Note – some of the following evaluations should be seen as forms of "Proto" Advocacy Evaluation, done prior to, or without regard for, current best practices in this field.  Many simultaneously conduct policy analysis and advocacy evaluation. Most are, at the least, useful examples for anyone wishing to conduct Advocacy Evaluation.

'''Aerial firefighting''' is the use of [[aircraft]] and other aerial resources to [[Wildfire suppression|combat wildfire]]s. The types of aircraft used include [[fixed-wing aircraft]] and [[helicopters]]. Smokejumpers and rappellers are also classified as aerial firefighters, delivered to the fire by parachute from a variety of fixed-wing [[aircraft]], or rappelling from [[helicopter]]s.  Chemicals used to fight fires may include water, water enhancers such as [[Fire-fighting foam|foam]]s and [[Fire-retardant gel|gel]]s, and specially formulated fire retardants such as [[Phos-Chek]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Terminology==
A wide variety of terminology has been used in the popular media for the aircraft (and methods) used in aerial firefighting. The terms '''airtanker''' or '''air tanker''' generally refer to fixed-wing aircraft based in the United States; "airtanker" is used in official documentation.&lt;ref name=9th&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=9th&amp;navby=case&amp;no=9810173|title=FindLaw's United States Ninth Circuit case and opinions.|publisher=|accessdate=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "'''waterbomber'''" is used in some Canadian government documents for the same class of vehicles,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business/AFFM/2ColumnSubPage/STEL02_165883.html Aviation Services - Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services], Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=redbook17&gt;{{cite web

 |quote=The popular media also frequently use the terms '''water bomber''', '''fire bomber''' or '''borate bomber'''. Helicopters often are used to drop retardant or water on a wildfire, whether they're functioning as helitankers (a heavy helicopter outfitted with a belly tank for dropping water or retardant on a fire), or medium- or light-weight helicopters equipped with buckets for smaller drops on fires). Some helicopters are used on fires for cargo (helitack) delivering supplies to firefighters, usually with netted cargo slung under a helicopter, and other helicopters are certified for and used for personnel transport -- ferrying wildland firefighters to remote locations where ground transport is either difficult or impossible.

'''Air attack''' is an industry term used for the actual application of aerial resources, both fixed-wing and rotorcraft, on a fire. Within the industry, though, "air attack" may also refer to the supervisor in the air (usually in a fixed-wing aircraft) who supervises the process of attacking the wildfire from the air, including fixed-wing airtankers, helicopters, and any other aviation resources assigned to the fire. The Air Tactical Group Supervisor (ATGS), often called "air attack," is usually flying at an altitude above other resources assigned to the fire, often in a fixed-wing plane but occasionally (depending on assigned resources or the availability of qualified personnel) in a helicopter.

Depending on the size, location, and assessed potential of the wildfire, the "air attack" or ATGS person may be charged with initial attack (the first response of firefighting assets on fire suppression), or with extended attack, the ongoing response to and management of a major wildfire requiring additional resources including engines, ground crews, and other aviation personnel and aircraft needed to control the fire and establish control lines or [[Firebreak|firelines]] ahead of the wildfire.&lt;ref name=redbook17/&gt;

== Equipment ==
A wide variety of helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft are used for aerial firefighting. In 2003, it was reported that "The [[U.S. Forest Service]] and [[Bureau of Land Management]] own, lease, or contract for nearly 1,000 aircraft each fire season, with annual expenditures in excess of US$250 million in recent years".&lt;ref name=blueribbon1&gt;

{{Main article|Helitack}}
Helicopters may be fitted with tanks (helitankers) or they may carry buckets. Some helitankers, such as the Erickson AirCrane, are also outfitted with a front-mounted foam cannon. Buckets are usually filled by submerging or dipping them in lakes, rivers, reservoirs, or portable tanks. The most popular of the buckets is the flexible [[Bambi bucket|Bambi Bucket]]. Tanks can be filled on the ground (by water tenders or truck-mounted systems) or water can be siphoned from lakes, rivers, reservoirs, or a portable tank through a hanging snorkel. Popular firefighting helicopters include variants of the [[UH-1 Iroquois|Bell 204]], [[Bell 205]], [[Bell 212]], [[Boeing Vertol 107]], [[Boeing Vertol 234]] and the [[S-64 Skycrane|Sikorsky  S-64 Aircrane]] helitanker, which features a snorkel for filling from a natural or man-made water source while in hover. Currently the world's largest helicopter, the [[Mil Mi-26]], uses a Bambi bucket.

'''Airtankers''' or '''water bombers''' are fixed-wing aircraft fitted with tanks that can be filled on the ground at an air tanker base or, in the case of [[flying boat]]s and [[amphibious aircraft]], by skimming water from lakes, reservoirs, or large rivers.

Various aircraft have been used over the years for firefighting. In 1947, the [[United States Air Force]] and [[United States Forest Service]] experimented with military aircraft dropping water-filled bombs. The bombs were unsuccessful, and the use of internal water tanks was adopted instead.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0N4DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA126&amp;dq=Popular+Science+1930+plane+%22Popular+Mechanics%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=W_WGTsHtEYTi0QHX37jcDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBDgo#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "Water Bombs for Forest Fires" ''Popular Mechanics'', October 1947]&lt;/ref&gt; Though World War II- and Korean War-era bombers were for a long time the mainstay of the aerial firefighting fleet,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://my.att.net/s/editorial.dll?eeid=6788631&amp;eetype=article&amp;render=y&amp;ck=&amp;ch=ne&amp;ch=ne|title=AT&amp;T - Page Not Available|publisher=|accessdate=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; newer purpose-built tankers have since come online. The smallest are the Single Engine Air Tankers (SEATs). These are agricultural sprayers that generally drop about {{convert|800|gal|l|-2}} of water or retardant. Examples include the [[Air Tractor AT-802]], which can deliver around {{convert|800|gal|l|-2}} of water or fire retardant solution in each drop, and the Soviet [[Antonov An-2]] biplane. Both of these aircraft can be fitted with floats that scoop water from the surface of a body of water. Similar in configuration to the World War II–era [[Consolidated PBY Catalina]], the [[Canadair CL-215]] and its derivative the [[Canadair CL-415|CL-415]] are designed and built specifically for firefighting. The [[Croatian Air Force]] uses six CL-415s as well as six AT 802s for firefighting purposes.

Medium-sized modified aircraft include the [[Grumman S-2 Tracker]] ([[retrofit]]ted with turboprop engines as the S-2T) as used by the [[California Department of Forestry &amp; Fire Protection]], as well as the [[Conair Firecat]] version developed and used by [[Conair Group Inc.]] of Canada, while the [[Douglas DC-4]], the [[Douglas DC-7]], the [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules]], the [[Lockheed P-2 Neptune]], and the [[Lockheed P-3 Orion]] &amp;ndash; and its commercial equivalent, the [[Lockheed L-188 Electra|L-188 Electra]] &amp;ndash; have been used as air tankers. Conair also converted a number of [[Convair 580]] and [[Fokker F27 Friendship]] turboprop airliners to air tankers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.airliners.net/search?keywords=Convair+580&amp;sortBy=dateAccepted&amp;sortOrder=desc&amp;perPage=36&amp;display=detail|title=Photos of Convair 580|work=[[Airliners.net]]|accessdate=July 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.airliners.net/search?keywords=Fokker+F-27&amp;sortBy=dateAccepted&amp;sortOrder=desc&amp;perPage=36&amp;display=detail|title=Photos of Fokker F-27|work=[[Airliners.net]]|accessdate=July 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest aerial firefighter ever used is a [[Boeing 747]] aerial firefighter, known as the [[Evergreen 747 Supertanker|Global Supertanker]], that can carry {{convert|19600|gal|l|-2}} fed by a pressurized drop system. The Supertanker was deployed operationally for the first time in 2009, fighting a fire in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.es/agencias/noticia.asp?noticia=58883 ABC - El 'superavión' bombero no fue efectivo en incendio Serranía de Cuenca] (in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; The tanker made its first American operation on August 31, 2009 at the [[August 2009 California wildfires|Oak Glen Fire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rimoftheworld.net/incident/7175 |title=Incident Report |publisher=Rimoftheworld.Net |date= |accessdate=2010-05-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902095408/http://www.rimoftheworld.net/incident/7175 |archivedate=2009-09-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/1873/ |title=InciWeb the Incident Information System: Oak Glen|publisher=Inciweb.org |date=2009-08-30 |accessdate=2010-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has since been replaced by a [[Boeing 747-400]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fireaviation.com/2015/08/12/like-the-phoenix-the-supertanker-to-rise-again/|title=Like the phoenix, the SuperTanker to rise again|website=Fire Aviation|accessdate=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another wide body jetliner that is currently being used as an air tanker is the modified [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]] operated by the 10 Tanker Air Carrier company as the [[DC-10 Air Tanker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.10tanker.com|title=10 Tanker LLC|publisher=|accessdate=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can carry up to {{convert|12,000|USgal|l|-2}} of fire fighting retardant.

The Russian [[Ministry of Emergency Situations (Russia)|Ministry of Emergency Situations]] operates convertible-to-cargo [[Ilyushin Il-76]] airtankers that have been operating with {{convert|11000|gal|l|-2|adj=on}} tanking systems, and several [[Beriev Be-200]] jet powered amphibians. The Be-200 can carry a maximum payload of about {{convert|12000|l|gal|-2}} of water, making "scoops" in suitable stretches of water in 14 seconds.

Bombardier's [[Bombardier Dash 8|Dash 8 Q Series]] aircraft are the basis of new, next-generation air tankers. [[Cascade Aerospace]] has converted two pre-owned Q400s to act as part-time water bomber and part-time transport aircraft for France's [[Sécurité Civile]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20051030013243/http://www.cascadeaerospace.com/products/Q400%20Air%20Tanker%20Conversion Q400 Airtanker Conversion]&lt;/ref&gt; while Neptune Aviation is converting a pre-owned Q300 as a prototype to augment its [[Lockheed P-2 Neptune]] aircraft. The Sécurité Civile also operates twelve Canadair CL-415 and nine [[Conair Firecat|Conair Turbo Firecat]] aircraft. Neptune Aviation also currently operates converted [[British Aerospace 146]] jetliners as air tankers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://neptuneaviation.com/operations-2/|title=Operations|work=neptuneaviation.com|accessdate=July 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BAe 146 can carry up to 3,000 gallons of fire fighting retardant.

Coulson Aviation unveiled the future of aerial fire fighting with the Boeing 737-300 in May 2017. Six aircraft have been purchased from Southwest Airlines for the RADS system conversion which is set to enter service in December 2017. The 737 aircraft is smaller than the C-130Q which allows for a wider range of airfields to be utilized. Britt Coulson further explained the aircraft will be able to retain the current seat and galley configuration for tanker operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fireaviation.com/2017/05/21/coulson-to-convert-737s-into-air-tankers/|title=Coulson to convert 737’s into air tankers|work=Fire Aviation|access-date=2017-10-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other former military aircraft utilized as firefighting air tankers in the U.S. in the past included the [[B-17]] and the [[PB4Y-2]], a version of the [[B-24]].

===Leadplanes===
The Lead Plane function directs the activities of the airtankers by both verbal target descriptions and by physically leading the airtankers on the drop run. The leadplane is typically referred to as a "Bird Dog" in Canada or "Supervision" aircraft in Australia. The [[O-2 Skymaster]], Cessna 310 and [[OV-10 Bronco]] have been used as spotter and lead plane platforms. The [[Ontario]] Ministry of Natural Resources has also used the [[Cessna 337]]. The [[Beechcraft Baron]] was long used as a leadplane or air attack ship, but most were retired in 2003; more common now is the [[Beechcraft King Air]] and the [[Aero Commander 500 family|Twin Commander 690]]. A Cessna Citation 500 jet owned by Air Spray (1967) LTd. was used by the British Columbia Ministry of Forests beginning in 1995 and used for two fire seasons to lead the very fast Electra L188 air tanker to the fires. This was the first time a jet aircraft was used as a lead plane or "bird dog". The Department of Parks and Wildlife in Western Australia operates a fleet of nine [[American Champion Scout]]s 8GCBC during the summer months as spotter aircraft and Air Attack platforms. The Provinces of Alberta and British Columbia and the Yukon Territories contract to supply Twin Commander 690 as bird dog aircraft for their air tanker fleets. Air Spray owns 9 Twin Commander 690 for use as bird dog aircraft.

===Fleet grounding===
In the United States, most of these aircraft are privately owned and contracted to government agencies, and the [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] and the [[U.S. Marines]] also maintain fleets of firefighting aircraft. On May 10, 2004, The [[U.S. Forest Service]] (USFS) and the [[Bureau of Land Management]] (BLM) announced that they were cancelling contracts with operators of 33 heavy airtankers. They cited liability concerns and an inability to safely manage the fleet after the wing failure and resulting [[2002 airtanker crashes|crash]] of a [[C-130]]A Hercules in [[California]] and a [[PB4Y-2 Privateer|PB4Y-2]] in [[Colorado]] during the summer of 2002. Both aged aircraft broke up in flight due to catastrophic [[metal fatigue|fatigue]] cracks at the wing roots. After subsequent third-party examination and extensive testing of all USFS contracted heavy airtankers, three companies were awarded contracts and now maintain a combined fleet of 23 aircraft.

Fire retardants often contain [[surfactant|wetting agents]], [[preservative]]s and [[rust inhibitor]]s and are colored red with [[ferric oxide]] or [[Fugitive pigment|fugitive color]] to mark where they have been dropped. Brand names of fire retardants for aerial application include [[Fire-Trol]] and [[Phos-Chek]].

Some water-dropping aircraft carry tanks of a guar gum derivative to thicken the water and reduce runoff.

==Tactics and capabilities==
[[File:Sikorsky S-70A-27 Picking Up Water.jpg|thumb|A helicopter dips its [[Bambi bucket|bucket]] into a river to drop water on a wildfire in California]]
Helicopters can hover over the fire and drop water or retardant. The S-64 Helitanker has [[microprocessor]]-controlled doors on its tank. The doors are controlled based on the area to be covered and wind conditions. Fixed-wing aircraft must make a pass and drop water or retardant like a bomber. Spotter (Air Tactical Group Supervisor) aircraft often orbit the fire at a higher altitude to coordinate the efforts of the smoke jumper, helicopter, media, and retardant-dropping aircraft; while lead planes fly low-level ahead of the airtankers to mark the [[trajectory]] for the drop, and ensure overall safety for both ground-based and aerial firefighters.

Water is usually dropped directly on flames because its effect is short-lived. Fire retardants are typically dropped ahead of the moving fire or along its edge and may remain effective for two or more days. This can create artificial [[firebreak]]s where the terrain is too rugged or remote for ground crews to cut fireline.

Aerial firefighting is most effectively used in conjunction with ground-based efforts, as aircraft are only one weapon in the firefighting arsenal. However, there have been cases of aircraft extinguishing fires long before ground crews were able to reach them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Christopher|first1=Ben|title=Does Using Airplanes to Put out Forest Fires Actually Work?|url=http://priceonomics.com/does-using-airplanes-to-put-out-forest-fires/|website=Priceonomics|accessdate=23 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some firefighting aircraft can refill their tanks in mid-flight, by flying down to skim the surface of large bodies of water. One example is the [[Bombardier CL-415]]. This is particularly useful in rural areas where flying back to an airbase for refills may take too much time.  In 2002 an Ontario CL-415 crew was able to refill 100 times within a 4-hour mission, delivering {{convert|162000|gal|l|-1}} or {{convert|1350000|lb|MT|0}} of water on a fire near Dryden Ontario. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} { June 1, 2002 Dryden fire # 10 Tanker #271 civil ident C-GOGE }

'''Anastasios George Leventis''' ({{lang-el|Αναστάσιος Γ. Λεβέντης}}; December 1902 – October 25, 1978) was a [[Greek Cypriot]] businessman who founded a major merchandise trading firm, A.G. Leventis (Nigeria) Plc, in West Africa. A dominant figure in the economy of many West African countries and especially [[Nigeria]], he was awarded the title of Babalaje of Egbaland by Alake [[Ladapo Ademola]].

His daughter Fotini married politician [[Tassos Papadopoulos]], who eventually became President of Cyprus.

==Early life==
Leventis was born in the village of [[Lemithou|Lemythou]], [[Limassol District]], in the [[Troodos Mountains]]. His father was a minister of the Greek Orthodox Church and was also a schoolmaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Supplement on A.G. Leventis|work=New Nigerian|date=December 19, 1978|ref=newnigeria}}&lt;/ref&gt;Leventis attended Mitsis Commercial School. At the age of 16, he traveled to France to look for employment and educational opportunities. In 1920, he took up a job opportunity in Nigeria working at a trading post in Nwaniba, along the [[Cross River (Nigeria)|Cross River]].

==Career==
In 1922, Leventis joined the firm of A.J. Tangalakis in Abeokuta, Ogun State. He developed most of his connections with Nigeria while working in the city. When his firm merged with G.B. Ollivant, Leventis stayed with amalgamated entity and rose to become the general manager of [[G. B. Ollivant]] in [[Ghana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agleventis.com/agleventis.shtml |title=Leventis Biography |accessdate=2007-04-26 |publisher=AG Leventis |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070830010255/http://www.agleventis.com/agleventis.shtml |archivedate=2007-08-30 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937, he left the firm after it was acquired by [[United Africa Company]].  Leventis then formed his own company and started out as a produce buyer, partly financed by some British cotton manufacturers. Leventis was assisted in the new venture by his brother C.P. Leventis, who organized the Nigerian branch in 1942 and a friend, G.E. Keralakis. In Ghana, Leventis was sympathetic to the cause of African nationalists. He was a friend of [[Kwame Nkrumah]] and [[J.B. Danquah]]. When a riot flared up in the country, many foreign stores were burnt and closed only Leventis owned stores untouched and open throughout the conflict period. He was made Ghanaian ambassador to France when Nkrumah was elected president of Ghana.

In the 1940s, the firm faced business challenges, UK authorities imposed a country by country quota on cotton imported from Africa, which was intended to influence textile and [[oil seed]] production in West Africa, and after the end of World War II, there were supply shortages. The former situation created the impetus for A.G. Leventis to establish a branch in [[Nigeria]], called [[A.G. Leventis Nigeria Plc]]. Within a few years the Nigerian company expanded its business line from cotton exports to merchandise trading and secured new sources of supplies.  In the late 1940s, the firm changed its strategy motivated by diversification and modernization. In 1960, Leventis Group speedily completed the [[Federal Palace Hotel]] at the request of the Nigerian government, the hotel served as accommodation for guests expected during Nigeria's independence celebration. By the 1960s his firm had grown to become one of the largest distributors in Nigeria and one of the largest merchandise traders in the West African region.  In Nigeria, he re-structured the business from general trading into a specialized trading firm and established various department stores. During this period, he thrived as a result of the nation's relatively open economy, as it was not until the 1970s that [[economic nationalism]] became a dominant initiative.  His marketing style made the Leventis name familiar to many customers in Nigeria. Apart from his sympathy for the nationalist movement in Africa, he also gave his support to his native country's independence movement. He developed a friendship with Arch-Bishop [[Makarios III]] who appointed him Cyprus' ambassador to UNESCO and awarded him the medal of St. Barnabas. 

==Philanthropy==
After his death in 1978, the A.G. Leventis Foundation was established in 1979. It has a primary focus on the cultural heritage of Cyprus and Greece, especially reflected in its collections of Cypriot antiquities displayed in several museums around the world, its restoration of cultural monuments, and its sponsorship of scholarships for postgraduate work in several fields including archaeology and agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ghananewsagency.org/education/foundation-awards-scholarships-to-27-post-graduates--67940|title=Foundation awards scholarships to 27 post-graduates|date=November 30, 2013|work=Ghana News Agency|accessdate=26 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation also sponsors work in the areas of environmental protection and medical research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leventisfoundation.org/en/|title=Welcome|work=A.G. Leventis Foundation|accessdate=26 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987 the A.G. Leventis Gallery was opened in the [[British Museum]], to display Cypriot antiquities from the early Bronze Age to the Roman era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Arapoglu|first=Evita|title=The A.G. Leventis Collection : 19th-20th century Greek paintings : 4-30 November 1994.|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/ag-leventis-collection-19th-20th-century-greek-paintings-4-30-november-1994/oclc/078241324|year=1994|publisher=Hellenic Center|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1997, a similar display was opened at the [[Fitzwilliam Museum]], and in 2000 another at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York.

In 2008 the A.G. Leventis Foundation endowed a new [[chair (academic)|chair]] at [[Cambridge University]] in [[Greek culture]]—the [[A. G. Leventis Professor of Greek Culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/news/new-chair-in-ancient-greek-culture-established|title=New chair in Ancient Greek culture established|date=October 7, 2008|work=University of Cambridge News|accessdate=26 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Private life==
The earliest records of his family go back to the 18th Century when a young ancestor had traveled to the Peloponnese to join the abortive 1770 uprising against Ottoman rule (known to history as the ‘Orlov’ rebellion). By the time of his birth, his family counted a number of distinguished clerics who served at the highest levels — metropolitan bishops, patriarchs from the Orthodox churches of Jerusalem and [[Antiochian Orthodox Church|Antioch]], as well as from the [[Church of Cyprus]].

Born in December 1902 in Lemythou, Cyprus to Neoklis/Papaneoklis Leventis and Salome Theocharides, he had several brothers and sisters: Costas; George, who firstly went to Egypt; Kalliopi, mother of film producer [[Alki David]]; Evagoras; Katerina, who wed Mr Myrianthousis; Charalambos; Anastasios; Christodoulos; and David.

He married Maria Fotini, with whom he had a child, Papadopoulos Leventis.

He is also uncle to Constantine (Dino) Leventis (1938–2002), businessman and major art benefactor of Hellenic art at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and other museums around the world: in April 2000, the Metropolitan Museum opened the A.G. Leventis Foundation Gallery where the museum's collection of Cypriot sculpture, terracottas, vases, jewelry and coins from the fifth and fourth centuries BC are displayed. The foundation also helped pay for similar galleries devoted to ancient Greek and Cypriot art in the British Museum, the Louvre in Paris and the Fitzwilliam Museum at Cambridge University, among others, according to its latest annual report. In Greece, it has financed extensive archeological work.

'''Arcplan''' is a [[software]] for [[Business Intelligence]] (BI), budgeting, planning &amp; forecasting (BP&amp;F), business analytics and collaborative Business Intelligence. It is the enhancement of the enterprise software inSight® and dynaSight of the former German provider arcplan Information Services GmbH. The company got merged with Canada-based Longview Solutions in 2015. Version 8.7. is available in a 32 and a 64 bit version at the moment.

Before the merger the company was managed by CEO Roland Hölscher and COO Steffen Weissbarth.

== Introduction==
The software supports users especially in the area of business intelligence (BI) that comprises clustered processes to select, evaluate and present data electronically. Furthermore, enterprise planning and decision making processes can be executed via data analysis. Arcplan is usually employed in midsized companies and large enterprises. Public institutions as well use arcplan.
In Germany arcplan is developed, distributed and maintained by arcplan Information Services GmbH (Langenfeld, Northrhine Westphalia).

== History and development ==
The Arcplan software emerged from the client server based software Insight in [[Düsseldorf]], Germany in 1993. The founders were the brothers Udo Wollschläger and Frank Hagedorn (both physicists) as well as the mathematician Dr. Hartmut Krins and the chemist Dr. Bernd Fröhlich. Initially, the software development was done by the physicists Udo Wollschläger, Frank Hagedorn, and Svend Dunkhorst. Holding 40% of the capital, the German Lindner Hotel Group was the largest shareholder, the other shares were held by the founders. In 2005 the company was acquired by Frankfurt (Main) based venture capital company ''Viewpoint Capital Partners GmbH''.&lt;ref&gt;press release: [http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20050810005450/en/arcplan-Continues-International-Expansion-Completes-EUR-27.5mn#.VHR2asmiBHY arcplan Continues International Expansion and Completes EUR 27.5mn - Recapitalization with ViewPoint Capital Partners], August 10, 2005. Access October 13, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 arcplan got sold to ''Marlin Equity Partners'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marlinequity.com/marlin-portfolio-company-longview-solutions-acquires-arcplan/|title=Marlin portfolio company Longview Solutions acquires arcplan|last=|first=|date=2015-03-31|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and merged with their portfolio company Longview Solutions.

Insight had an integrated development environment that reflected a flexible editor´s concept. With the help of the editor´s concept users were enabled to create customized reports via Drag &amp; Drop without any programming skills.&lt;ref&gt;Comparing: Bernd-Ulrich Kaiser: [https://www.amazon.com/Unternehmensinformation-SAP--EIS-Bernd-Ulrich-Kaiser/dp/3528355646/ref=sr_1_2/183-8540380-3862052?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1394115291&amp;sr=1-2 Unternehmensinformation mit SAP ®-EIS, Aufbau eines Data Warehouses und einer inSight®-Anwendung], Friedr. Vieweg &amp; Sohn Verlagsgesellschaft mbH, Braunschweig/Wiesbaden, 1997, chapter 4, section 4.3, page 53 f.&lt;/ref&gt; The editor´s concept in general and the drag &amp; drop report development in particular were innovations in comparison to the competition.

In the early 90s arcplan was one of the first software programs to directly access SAP data for reporting and analysis.

In 1996 Insight being the integrated development environment became part of the webserver based software Dynasight. Dynasight was one of the first software solutions to integrate corporate management. It enabled the access to business applications via a Java-capable browser.
After having developed Dynasight to a business intelligence platform, dynaSight (Version 4.1) evolved to arcplan Enterprise (Version 5.0) in March 2006. Since September 2013 the business intelligence platform is available as arcplan 8 providing three modules for a different scope of applications. With the release of version 8, [[HTML5]] is supported; furthermore the access via mobile devices was simplified by implementing a responsive design approach.

Before the merger Arcplan had offices in Germany, the United States, Switzerland and [[Singapore]]. Arcplan resellers were located in the People´s Republic of China, [[Korea]], [[Chile]], [[Finland]] and Russia. The company employed around 100 people globally before the merger.

== Scope of applications ==
The software meets the typical requirements of a business intelligence application and offers, depending on the package, several additional functionalities. The integrated platform for reporting and planning is looked upon as a unique selling proposition by IT market research provider Gartner Inc.&lt;ref&gt;Gartner Research - J.Hagerty, R. Sallam, J. Richardson: [http://www.gartner.com/technology/reprints.do?id=1-1QLGACN&amp;ct=140210&amp;st=sb Magic Quadrant for Business intelligence platform], 20. Februar 2014.

Bush on his stewardship of the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Transcript of ABC News interview with President Bush|newspaper=USA Today|date=January 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; But her reporting also focused on the challenges faced by ordinary Americans. Her signature series, “The Kitchen Table Economy,” featured intimate portraits of families affected by the economic crisis.

On April 2, 2010, Stark announced that she had been laid off as part of a 25 percent staff downsizing by ABC News.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/450967-ABC_News_Betsy_Stark_Let_Go.php?rssid=20065|title=ABC News' Betsy Stark Let Go|last=Guthrie|first=Marisa|date=April 2, 2010|work=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|accessdate=April 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2010, Stark contributed stories to the [[PBS NewsHour]], including a series of reports on how the tough economy was impacting the 2010 midterm elections, part of PBS' Patchwork Nation project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/politics/july-dec10/ohio_10-22.html|title = In Ohio, Job Losses May Sway Election Choices|date = Oct 22, 2010|publisher = PBS NewsHour}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, she also served as guest host of WBUR’s On Point, a two-hour national radio program syndicated by [[NPR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://onpoint.wbur.org/about-on-point/betsy-stark|accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stark began her television career as a documentary producer for the [[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS) program "Inside Story," for which she won a 1983 Emmy Award for Outstanding Investigative Reporting for her work on the [[CBS News]] versus [[William Westmoreland]] lawsuit.

In 1988, she joined [[Dow Jones]] as a correspondent and later senior producer of the weekly "[[Wall Street Journal Report]]." In 1996, she became anchor and editor of her own live, daily business news program, "Heard on the Street A.M."

'''Breakage''' is a term used in [[telecommunications]] and [[accounting]] to indicate any type of service which is unused by the customer. A good example would be [[gift cards]] or [[Telephone card|calling cards]] that have been sold but never redeemed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.servicelevel.net/rating_matters/newsletters/issue10.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Revenue from breakage is almost entirely profitable, since companies need not provide any goods or services for unredeemed gift cards. It should not be confused with [[Shrinkage (accounting)]] (items which are not used by the customer because they disappeared from inventory).

In 2006, a blog called "The Stalwart" criticized [[Best Buy]] for using estimated breakage to improve their revenue numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thestalwart.com/the_stalwart/2005/12/best_buy_neithe.html
|title=The Stalwart|accessdate=2006-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In telecommunications ==
In telecommunications, breakage can occur in several ways. The key elements in maximizing revenue versus service via breakage are:

* Use of quanta (pay for more than you use).
* [[Product bundling|Bundling of mixed services]] (force purchase of other services).
* Expiry of purchased service (ideally expire monthly).
* Inflexibility of plans (with high charges for exceeding arbitrary fixed limits).
* Low flexibility in changing plans (e.g. upgrade for free, pay to downgrade).
* Low transparency of service usage and fees.

The following examples are given in terms of voice calling, although they may also apply to data, short message or other services.

*''[[Rounding|Rounding-Up]]'': A call will often be rounded-up to a billing quantum. E.g. a call of 12 seconds may be billed as 60 seconds, and a call of 61 seconds billed as 120 seconds.
*''Minimum Balance Requirement'': A calling service may require a minimum balance before it can be used. E.g. The billing quanta is 60 seconds, however the service will not let you begin a call unless you have sufficient funds for at least two minutes of calling.
*''Unusable Amounts'': The unit charge values may be such that it is impossible to use all of the nominal amount purchased. A $10 calling card is charged at $1.05 per minute. After $9.45 is used, the remaining $.55 is not sufficient to make any call.
*''Abandoned Accounts'': Accounts or calling cards which are lost or abandoned while still retaining significant credit. This is the equivalent of the meaning of the term "Breakage" in the gift card context.
*''Expired Amounts'': The subscriber is forced to pre-purchase large services amounts which expire if not used within a specified period.
*''Unused/Unbalanced Bundles'': A bundle of services includes a mix of features. For example, a $30 per month package may include 3000 free Short Messages and 60 national calling voice minutes. Many customers may use most of the short messages, but not use the voice minutes. Other customers may use most of the voice minutes, but not the short messages.
*''Flat Plans, Bumpy Usage'': A service plan may include a flat rate, e.g. 10 GB of data per month. However, the client's usage may be highly variable. E.g. one month they may use only 1 GB, despite having paid for 10 GB. The following month, they may use 20 GB, with the additional 10 GB being charged at a significantly higher "overflow" rate.

Careful research and planning can maximise some forms of breakage. For example, if a high percentage of mobile voice calls on the network are less than one minute in duration, then a rating plan could use an initial quanta of 60 seconds, followed by 1 second quanta. The plan appears to use a low quanta, but in fact many calls will be hit by the initial 60 second quanta.

Similarly, if many users are shown to use 14 GB of data per month on a data plan, then offering data plans of 10 GB or 30 GB will force many users to pay for much more data than they need, which will expire at the end of each month.

'''Brief psychotherapy''' (also '''brief therapy''', '''planned short-term therapy''')&lt;ref&gt;Bandler, Richard. Time for a Change. Cupertino, Calif.: Meta Publications, 1993. 20. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  is an umbrella term for a variety of approaches to short-term, solution-oriented [[psychotherapy]].

==Overview==
Brief therapy differs from other schools of therapy in that it emphasizes (1) a focus on a specific problem and (2) direct intervention. In brief therapy, the therapist takes responsibility for working more pro-actively with the client in order to treat clinical and subjective conditions faster. It also emphasizes precise observation, utilization of natural resources, and a temporary [[suspension of disbelief]] to consider new perspectives and multiple viewpoints.

Rather than the formal analysis of historical causes of distress, the primary approach of brief therapy is to help the client to view the present from a wider context and to utilize more functional understandings (not necessarily at a [[consciousness|conscious]] level). By becoming aware of these new understandings, successful clients will ''de facto'' undergo spontaneous and generative change.

Brief therapy is often highly strategic, exploratory, and solution-based rather than problem-oriented. It is less concerned with how a problem arose than with the current factors sustaining it and preventing change. Brief therapists do not adhere to one "correct" approach, but rather accept that there being many paths, any of which may or may not in combination turn out to be ultimately beneficial.

==Founding proponents==
[[Milton Erickson]] was a practitioner of brief therapy, using clinical [[hypnosis]] as his primary tool. To a great extent he developed this himself. His approach was popularized by [[Jay Haley]], in the book "Uncommon therapy: The psychiatric techniques of Milton Erickson M.D."
{{quote|"The analogy Erickson uses is that of a person who wants to change the course of a river. if he opposes the river by trying to block it, the river will merely go over and around him. But if he ''accepts'' the force of the river and diverts it in a new direction, the force of the river will cut a new channel."&lt;ref&gt;Haley, Jay. ''Uncommon Therapy; the Psychiatric Techniques of Milton H. Erickson, M.D.'' New York: Norton, 1973. 24. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Richard Bandler]], the co-founder of [[neuro-linguistic programming]], is another firm proponent of brief therapy. After many years of studying Erickson's therapeutic work, he wrote:&lt;ref&gt;Bandler, Richard. ''Time for a Change''. Cupertino, Calif.: Meta Publications, 1993. 20. Print.
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"It's easier to cure a phobia in ten minutes than in five years... I didn't realize that the speed with which you do things makes them last... I taught people the phobia cure. They'd do part of it one week, part of it the next, and part of it the week after. Then they'd come to me and say "It doesn't work!" If, however, you do it in five minutes, and repeat it till it happens very fast, the brain understands. That's part of how the brain learns... I discovered that the human mind does not learn slowly. It learns quickly. I didn't know that."}}

'''Business Park Skejby''' is a large [[business park]] in the northern district of [[Aarhus N]], in the city of Aarhus, Denmark. 

Business Park Skejby was officially created in 2013 and stretches north from the neighbourhood of Christiansbjerg to Skejby and is bounded by the major roads of [[Ring 2 (Aarhus)|Ring 2]] and [[Randersvej]].&lt;ref&gt;BSP: [http://businessparkskejby.dk/Om-BPS.aspx A map of Business Park Skejby]&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the businesses and institutions within the park area were constructed several decades ago.

==Description==
Apart from small and large businesses, the business park area is also home to the smaller business park of Agro Food Park, a large number of educational facilities and a few residential areas as well. Major institutions, most of which predates 2013, includes:

* [[Aarhus University Hospital|The New University Hospital]] (DNU)
* [[NRGi]] headquarters. NRGi is a large Danish coop energy company.&lt;ref&gt;NRGi: [http://nrgiinfo.dk/nrgiinfo/om-nrgi/om-nrgi/nrgi-huset/ NRGi-huset]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Vestas Wind Systems]], headquarters
* [[IBM]], Danish headquarters
* [[Olympus Corporation|Olympus]]
* [[Danmarks Radio]], Jutland department
* [[Danish School of Journalism]], the Aarhus campus of the Danish School of Media and Journalism.
* [[VIA University College]], Campus Aarhus N
* [[SOSU aarhus]] educational centre for social- and healthcareworkers
* [[INCUBA Science Park]], headquarters
* [[Agro Food Park]]
* [[Aarhus Skøjtehal]], an indoor ice skating rink
* [[Aarhus Academy]]
* [[Aarhus Tech]], main campus

Landmarks for the area includes ''Aarhus Vandtårn'', a former water tower in red brick with a bright green copper roof, the nature site of [[Vestereng]] - a former military training ground -, and the old village of [[Skejby]] with an old white-washed village church.

Business Park Skejby has its headquarters outside the park in the library and culture centre of [[Dokk1]] at the harbourfront.

== Transportation ==
The business park is located at the outer ring road of [[Ring 2 (Aarhus)|Ring 2]] (Hasle Ringvej) and the intercity motorway of Randersvej, with easy access to all of Aarhus. 

Since December 2017, the business park has been connected to the inner city, including the business park headquarters and the central station, by the [[Aarhus light rail]], an electric tram system.

The '''CitySpire Center''' is the third tallest [[Mixed-use development|mixed-use]] [[skyscraper]] in [[New York City]], located on the south side of West 56th Street between 6th and 7th Avenues in [[Midtown (Manhattan)|Midtown Manhattan]]. Finished in 1987, it is 248 meters (814&amp;nbsp;ft) tall and has 75 floors, with a total area of {{convert|359000|sqft|m2}}. The building is owned by [[Tishman Speyer Properties]].

==Overview==
Designed by [[Helmut Jahn]], it is the [[tallest buildings in New York City|twenty fifth-tallest building in New York City]] and the [[List of tallest buildings in the United States|42nd tallest in the United States]]. The bottom 23 floors of the tower are for commercial use and above it are luxury apartments, which increase in size the higher they are.

Soon after the building's completion, residents of nearby buildings complained of hearing a loud whistling noise which, it later turned out, came from the wind blowing through the decorative dome at the building's top. The city threatened daily fines for the noise, which lasted for more than a year. Developers silenced the whistle by removing every other louver in the cooling tower, thereby widening the narrow channels through which the wind whistled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Whistle Silenced, Cityspire Sales Resume |first=David W. |last=Dunlap |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CEFD9143BF930A25755C0A965958260 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=June 13, 1993 |accessdate=2010-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Moorish-inspired dome, which is a homage to the adjacent [[New York City Center]] on West [[55th Street (Manhattan)|55th Street]], is illuminated at night with a white light.  The building has an unusual octagonal shape.

CitySpire Center is part of a cluster of four tall towers along with the [[Carnegie Hall Tower]] (which mimics the design of its famous namesake concert hall), the [[Metropolitan Tower (New York)|Metropolitan Tower]] and [[One57]].

Some time around completion, it was revealed that the building exceeded its height limit by around 14 feet (4 m).  The developers compensated for this violation by agreeing to build dance studio space for the city's Department of Cultural Affairs on an adjacent site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pact Reached On Skyscraper Built Too Tall |first=David W. |last=Dunlap |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/20/nyregion/pact-reached-on-skyscraper-built-too-tall.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=April 20, 1988 |accessdate=2010-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rank==
When completed, the CitySpire Center was the second tallest [[concrete]] tower in the world after the [[Willis Tower]] in [[Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cityrealty.com/nyc/midtown-west/cityspire-150-west-56th-street/review/4666 |title=CitySpire, Building Review |publisher=CityRealty.com |accessdate=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1330">'''Civiløkonom''', literally "civil economist", is a professional title in [[Denmark]] (with corresponding titles in [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]], see below under "See also") used for an individual who holds a certain degree in business administration and economics after three years of studies: ''Erhvervsvidenskabelig Afgangseksamen'' (in Danish) ''candidatus mercaturae'' (in [[Latin language|Latin]]). The ''candidatus mercaturae'' (cand.merc. for short) is a 2-year MSc programme on top of the BSc ''Handelsvidenskabelig Afgangseksamen'' (HA for short), so a person holding a cand.merc title has studied at a university for at least 5 years (3 years as an undergraduate/college student, and 2 years in graduate school). Both the undergraduate and the graduate programs are offered as combination programs including other scientific fields, such as computer science, psychology, math, philosophy etc.

The word '''coolie''' (also spelled ''koelie'', ''kuli'', ''cooli'', ''cooly'' and ''quli''); ([[Hindi]]: कुली, [[Bengali language|Bengali]]: কুলি, [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]]: કૂલી, [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]: ਕੁਲੀ, [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: கூலி, [[Telugu language|Telugu]]: కూలీ, [[Kannada language|Kannada]]: ಕೂಲೀ, [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]]: കൂലി, [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]: කූලී, [[Urdu]]: {{Nastaliq|ٹھنڈا}}, [[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 苦力, [[Persian language|Persian]]: کولی) meaning a [[labourer]], has a variety of other implications and is sometimes regarded as offensive or a pejorative, depending upon the historical and geographical context. It is similar, in many respects, to the Spanish term [[peon]], although both terms are used in some countries, with slightly differing implications.

During the 19th and early 20th centuries, coolie was usually a term implying an [[Indentured servitude|indentured labourer]] from [[South Asia]], [[South East Asia]] or [[China]].

In South Asia, it is now a commonly used and inoffensive word for workers in unskilled manual labour, especially [[Porter (carrier)|porters]] at railway stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gaurav |first1=Kumar |last2=Singhal |first2=Mayank |title = Licensing and Livelihood: Railway Coolies |publisher=Centre for Civil Society (CCS), India |location = |url = http://ccs.in/internship_papers/2003/chap22.pdf |accessdate = 6 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, coolie is now regarded as derogatory and/or a [[racial slur]] in the [[Caribbean]], [[Africa]], [[Oceania]], [[North America]], [[Southeast Asia]] and [[Europe]] – in reference to [[Asian people|people from Asia]].{{efn|1= Some current dictionaries do not record any offensive meaning ("an unskilled laborer or porter usually in or from the Far East hired for low or subsistence wages" [http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&amp;va=coolie Merriam-Webster]) or make a distinction between an offensive meaning in referring to "a person from the Indian subcontinent or of [[Non-resident Indian|Indian descent]]" and an at least originally inoffensive, old-fashioned meaning, for example "''dated'' an unskilled native labourer in [[South Asia]], [[China]], and some other [[Asia]]n countries" ([https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/coolie Compact Oxford English Dictionary]). However, some dictionaries indicate that the word may be considered offensive in all contexts today. For example, [[Dictionary.com]]
considers all uses of the noun "Disparaging and Offensive".  [http://pewebdic2.cw.idm.fr Longman]'s 1995 edition had "''old-fashioned'' an unskilled worker who is paid very low wages, especially in parts of Asia", but the current version adds "''taboo old-fashioned'' a very offensive word ...

== Etymology ==
The origins of the word are uncertain but it is thought to have originated from the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] word for a payment for work, ''kuli'' ({{lang|ta|கூலி}}).&lt;ref name="oed_full"&gt;{{Citation |title = Oxford English Dictionary |url = http://www.oed.com/viewdictionaryentry/Entry/40991 |accessdate = 19 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{Citation |url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/136194/coolie |title = Britannica Academic Edition |accessdate=19 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative etymological explanation is that the word came from [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] word ''qulī'' ({{lang|hi|क़ुली}}, قلی), which itself could be from the [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] word for slave (or as a general name for imperial subjects regardless of other social status), [[:wikt:قول|قول]] (''qul'').&lt;ref name=oed_full/&gt; Another explanation is that the [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] word ''qulī'' originated from the Gujarati aboriginal tribe or caste known as ''Kuli'', and the word was picked up by the Portuguese who then used it in South India, hence the Tamil word ''kuli''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/coolie|title=coolie|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word was used in this sense for labourers from India. In 1727, Dr.&amp;nbsp;[[Engelbert Kaempfer|Engelbert Kämpfer]] described "coolies" as dock labourers who would unload Dutch merchant ships at [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] in Japan.&lt;ref name="Kämpfer"&gt;{{cite book

==History of the coolie trade==
Social and political pressure led to the abolition of the slave trade throughout the [[British Empire]] in 1807, with other European nations following suit. Labour-intensive industries, such as [[cotton plantation|cotton]] and [[sugar plantation]]s, mines and railway construction, in the colonies were left without a cheap source of manpower.&lt;ref name="ChineseCoolies5"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://personal.anderson.ucla.edu/eloisa.borah/chronology.pdf |title = Chronology of Filipinos in America Pre-1989 |author=Eloisa Gomez Borah |year=1997 |work=Anderson School of Management |publisher=[[University of California, Los Angeles]] |accessdate=25 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, a large-scale slavery-like trade in Asian (primarily Indian and Chinese) indentured labourers began in the 1820s to fill this vacuum. Some of these labourers signed contracts based on misleading promises, some were kidnapped and sold into the trade, some were victims of clan violence whose captors sold them to coolie brokers, while others sold themselves to pay off gambling debts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Joaquin |last=Gonzalez |title=Filipino American Faith in Action: Immigration, Religion, and Civic Engagement |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=vxdJXdqPuuEC&amp;lpg=PA20&amp;dq=filipino%20landing%20morro%20bay&amp;pg=PA20 |year=2009 |publisher=NYU Press |ISBN = 9780814732977 |pages=21–22 }}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Yo |editor1-last=Jackson |title = Encyclopedia of Multicultural Psychology |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_hcurFqnQioC&amp;lpg=PA216 |year=2006 |publisher=SAGE |ISBN = 9781412909488 |page=216 }}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite book |first=E.

Much like slave plantations, there were preconceived notions of how different ethnicities worked. In his paper "Eastern Coolie Labour," W. L. Distant recalled his time on an estate observing the work ethic and behaviors of Coolies. Just as many believed that Africans had an affinity for hard outdoor labor, Distant believed that Indian, Chinese, and Japanese Coolies were different in their ability to perform certain jobs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Indian Coolies were viewed as lower in status. Those who ran estates believed that Chinese and Japanese Coolies were harder working, united, and clean. Indian Coolies, on the other hand, were viewed as dirty and were treated as children who required constant supervision.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Although there are reports of ships for Asian coolies carrying women and children, the great majority of them were men. Regulations were put in place as early as 1837 by the [[British Raj|British authorities in India]] to safeguard these principles of voluntary, contractual work and safe and sanitary transportation, although in practice this rarely occurred (especially during examples such as the Pacific Passage or the Guano Pits of Peru). The Chinese government also made efforts to secure the well-being of their nation's workers, with representations being made to relevant governments around the world.

=== Chinese coolies ===
Workers from China were mainly transported to work in [[Peru]] and [[Cuba]]. However, many Chinese laborers worked in British colonies such as Singapore, [[Jamaica]], [[British Guiana]] (now [[Guyana]]), [[British Malaya]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[British Honduras]] (now [[Belize]]) - as well as in the Dutch colonies within the [[Dutch East Indies]], and [[Suriname]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.everyculture.com/Middle-America-Caribbean/Chinese-in-the-English-Speaking-Caribbean.html : Chinese in the English-Speaking Caribbean]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Look Lai |first=Walton |title = The Chinese in the West Indies: a documentary history, 1806–1995 |year=1998 |publisher=[[University of the West Indies Press|The Press University of the West Indies]] |ISBN = 976-640-021-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Li|2004|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Robinson|2010|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=xrGShVU6VrgC&amp;pg=PA108 108]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first shipment of Chinese labourers was to the British colony of [[Trinidad]] in 1806.

In 1847, two ships from Cuba transported workers to [[Havana]] to work in the sugar cane fields from the port of [[Xiamen]], one of the five Chinese [[treaty port]]s opened to the British by the [[Treaty of Nanking]] in 1842. The trade soon spread to other ports in [[Guangdong]], and demand became particularly strong in Peru for workers in the [[silver mine]]s and the [[guano]] collecting industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title = Asia-Canada:Chinese Coolies |url = http://asia-canada.ca/changing-perspectives/chinese/chinese-labour-builds-cpr |accessdate = 14 June 2013 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130507045115/http://asia-canada.ca/changing-perspectives/chinese/chinese-labour-builds-cpr |archive-date = 7 May 2013 |dead-url = yes |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title = American Involvement in the Coolie Trade |url = http://www.ea.sinica.edu.tw/eu_file/12011679494.pdf |accessdate = 14 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title = Chinese Coolies in Cuba |url = https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1876/07/16/81694895.pdf |accessdate=14 June 2013 |work = The New York Times |date=16 July 1876 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Chinese Indentured Labour in Peru |url = http://www.historytoday.com/lawrence-clayton/chinese-indentured-labour-peru |accessdate = 14 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia began importing workers in 1848, and the United States began using them in 1865 on the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]] construction. These workers were deceived about their terms of employment to a much greater extent than their Indian counterparts, and consequently, there was a much higher level of Chinese emigration during this period.

[[File:Amoy, from Kulangseu.jpg|thumb|left|Illustration of the [[Xiamen|port of Amoy]], where many Chinese labourers were shipped to foreign lands, by Edwin Joshua Dukes.]]
The trade flourished from 1847 to 1854 without incident, until reports began to surface of the mistreatment of the workers in Cuba and Peru. As the British government had political and legal responsibility for many of the ports involved - including [[Amoy]] - such ports were immediately closed. Despite these closures, the trade simply shifted to the more accommodating port within the Portuguese enclave of [[Portuguese Macau|Macau]].&lt;ref name="whkmla" /&gt;

Many coolies were first deceived or kidnapped and, then kept in [[barracoon]]s (detention centres) or loading vessels in the ports of departure, as were [[Slavery in Africa|African slaves]]. Their voyages, which are sometimes called the Pacific Passage, were as inhumane and dangerous as the notorious [[Middle Passage]] of the [[Atlantic slave trade]].&lt;ref name=britain1&gt;{{cite web |title=Forced Labour|year=2010|publisher=The National Archives, Government of the United Kingdom |url = http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/blackhistory/india/forced.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Trade2&gt;{{Citation |title=Slave Trade:Coolie Trade |url = http://facweb.northseattle.edu/cadler/Global_Dialogues/Readings/Monkey_Hunting_Readings/Slave%20Trade%20Coolie%20Trade.pdf |accessdate=29 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mortality was very high;  it is estimated that from 1847 to 1859, the average mortality rate for coolies aboard ships to Cuba was 15.2 percent, and losses among those aboard ships to Peru were as high as 40 percent in the 1850s, and 30.44 percent from 1860 to 1863.&lt;ref name=Trade2/&gt;

They were sold and were taken to work in plantations or mines with very bad living and working conditions. The duration of a contract was typically five to eight years, but many coolies did not live out their term of service due to hard labour and mistreatment. Survivors were often forced to remain in servitude beyond the contracted period. The coolies who worked on the sugar plantations in Cuba and in the guano beds of the [[Chincha Islands]] (the islands of Hell) of Peru were treated brutally. Seventy-five percent of the Chinese coolies in Cuba died before fulfilling their contracts. More than two-thirds of the Chinese coolies who arrived in Peru between 1849 and 1874 died within the contract period. In 1860 it was calculated that of the 4000 coolies brought to the Chinchas since the trade began, not one had survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Encyclopædia Britannica, 9th edition |article=Coolie |year=1877 |publisher=Adam and Charles Black }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of these unbearable conditions, Chinese coolies often revolted against their Ko-Hung bosses and foreign company bosses at ports of departure, on ships, and in foreign lands. The coolies were put in the same neighbourhoods as Africans and, since most were unable to return to their homeland or have their wives come to the New World, many married African women. The coolies' interracial relationships and marriages with Africans, Europeans and [[Indigenous peoples|Indigenous]] peoples, formed some of the modern world's [[Afro-Asian]] and [[Asian Latin American]] populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://taste-of-peru.com/peruvian_culture/chinese.php |title = Taste of Peru |publisher = Taste of Peru |date =  |accessdate = 2013-06-16 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130927041027/http://taste-of-peru.com/peruvian_culture/chinese.php |archive-date = 27 September 2013 |dead-url = yes |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0102-311X2006001100018 Influência da aculturação na autopercepção dos idosos quanto à saúde bucal em uma população de origem japonesa]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upf.edu/mon/assig/xialmo/mat/dorsey_4.pdf Identity, Rebellion, and Social Justice Among Chinese Contract Workers in Nineteenth-Century Cuba] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220035052/http://www.upf.edu/mon/assig/xialmo/mat/dorsey_4.pdf |date=20 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cu.html CIA – The World Factbook].

Chinese immigration to the United States was almost entirely voluntary, but working and social conditions were still harsh.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} In 1868, the [[Burlingame Treaty]] allowed unrestricted Chinese immigration into the country. Within a decade significant levels of anti-Chinese sentiment had built up, stoked by populists such as [[Denis Kearney]] with racist slogans – "To an American, death is preferable to life on a par with the Chinese."&lt;ref&gt;[http://dailyheadlines.uark.edu/3437.htm University of Arkansas] {{webarchive |url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061029040736/http://dailyheadlines.uark.edu/3437.htm |date = 29 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although [[Chinese Railroad Workers|Chinese workers]] contributed to the building of the first First Transcontinental Railroad in the United States and of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] in western Canada, Chinese settlement was discouraged after completion of the construction. California's [[Anti-Coolie Act of 1862]] levied a monthly tax on Chinese immigrants doing business in the state, and the federal [[Chinese Exclusion Act (United States)|Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882]] prohibited immigration of Chinese laborers (repealed 1943).

Despite attempts to restrict the influx of cheap labour from China, beginning in the 1870s Chinese workers helped construct a vast network of [[levee]]s in the [[Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta]]. These levees made thousands of acres of fertile [[marsh]]lands available for agricultural production.

The 1879 [[Constitution of the State of California]] declared that "Asiatic coolieism is a form of human slavery, and is forever prohibited in this State, and all contracts for coolie labour shall be void."&lt;ref name="calcon"&gt;[http://www.stcl.edu/faculty_pages/faculty_folders/steiner/aal/thechineseincalifornia_files/frame.htm#slide0019.htm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927160736/http://www.stcl.edu/faculty_pages/faculty_folders/steiner/aal/thechineseincalifornia_files/frame.htm#slide0019.htm |date=27 September 2007 }} The Chinese in California, 1850–1879&lt;/ref&gt;

They were neither free nor slaves. Indentured Chinese servants also labored in the [[sugarcane]] fields of Cuba well after the 1884 abolition of slavery in that country. Two scholars of Chinese labor in Cuba, Juan Pastrana and Juan Perez de la Riva, substantiated horrific conditions of Chinese coolies in Cuba&lt;ref name="CubanCoolies7"&gt;{{Citation |title = Significance of Chinese Coolies to Cuba |url = http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/jaas/summary/v004/4.2yun.html |accessdate=14 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and stated that coolies were slaves in all but name.&lt;ref name="CubanCoolies7" /&gt; Denise Helly is one researcher who believes that despite their slave-like treatment, the free and legal status of the Asian laborers in Cuba separated them from slaves. The coolies could challenge their superiors, run away, petition government officials, and rebel according to Rodriguez Pastor and Trazegnies Granda.&lt;ref&gt;Helly, "Idéologie et ethnicité"; Rodríguez Pastor, "Hijos del Celeste Imperio"; Trazegnies Granda, "En el país de las colinas de arena", Tomo II&lt;/ref&gt; Once they had fulfilled their contracts the ''colonos asiáticos'' integrated into the countries of Peru, [[The Dominican Republic]], [[Puerto Rico]] and Cuba. They adopted cultural traditions from the natives and also welcomed in non-Chinese to experience and participate into their own traditions.&lt;ref name="Narvaez, Benjamin N 1886"/&gt; Before the [[Cuban Revolution]] in 1959, [[Havana, Cuba|Havana]] had Latin America's largest [[Chinatown]].

In South America, Chinese indentured labourers worked in Peru's silver mines and coastal industries (i.e., [[guano]], sugar, and cotton) from the early 1850s to the mid-1870s; about 100,000 people immigrated as [[Indentured servant|indentured]] workers. They participated in the [[War of the Pacific]], looting and burning down the [[haciendas]] where they worked, after the [[occupation of Lima|capture of Lima]] by the invading Chilean army in January 1880. Some 2000 coolies even joined the Chilean Army in Peru, taking care of the wounded and burying the dead. Others were sent by Chileans to work in the newly conquered [[Tarapacá Region|nitrate fields]].&lt;ref name="bonilla"&gt;Bonilla, Heraclio. 1978. The National and Colonial Problem in Peru.

The Chinese Engineering and Mining Corporation, of which later U.S. president [[Herbert Hoover]] was a director, was instrumental in supplying Chinese coolie labour to South African mines from c.1902 to c.1910 at the request of mine owners, who considered such labour cheaper than native African and white labour.&lt;ref name="Liggett 1930"&gt;[[Walter Liggett]], The Rise of Herbert Hoover (New York, 1932)&lt;/ref&gt; The horrendous conditions suffered by the coolie labourers led to questions in the British parliament as recorded in [[Hansard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Indian South Africans:Coolie commission 1872|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/report-coolie-commission-1872|accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1866, the British, French and Chinese governments agreed to mitigate the abuse by requiring all traders to pay for the return of all workers after their contract ended. The employers in the [[British West Indies]] declined these conditions, bringing the trade there to an end. Until the trade was finally abolished in 1875, over 150,000 coolies had been sold to Cuba alone, the majority having been shipped from Macau. These labourers endured conditions far worse than those experienced by their Indian counterparts. Even after the 1866 reforms, the scale of abuse and conditions of near slavery did not get any better – if anything they deteriorated. In the early 1870s increased media exposure of the trade led to a public outcry, and the British, as well as the [[Qing government]], put pressure on the Portuguese authorities to bring the trade at Macau to an end; this was ultimately achieved in 1874.&lt;ref name="whkmla" /&gt; By that time, a total of up to half a million Chinese workers had been exported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=H7dBmBsd-XgC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |title = The Coolie Trade: The Traffic in Chinese Laborers to Latin America 1847–1874 |last = Meagher |first = Arnold J. |year=2008 |publisher = Arnold J. |accessdate = 2013-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''coolie'' was also applied to Chinese workers recruited for contracts on cacao plantations in German Samoa. German planters went to great lengths to secure access to their "coolie" labour supply from China. In 1908 a Chinese commissioner, Lin Shu Fen, reported on the cruel treatment of coolie workers on German plantations in the western Samoan Islands. The trade began largely after the establishment of colonial German Samoa in 1900 and lasted until the arrival of New Zealand forces in 1914. More than 2000 Chinese "coolies" were present in the islands in 1914 and most were eventually repatriated by the New Zealand administration.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

By the 1820s, many Indians (they were referred to as Klings, or [[Keling]], which was used as a derogatory word, much as the word Coolie&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;) were voluntarily enlisting to go abroad for work, in the hopes of a better life. European merchants and businessmen quickly took advantage of this and began recruiting them for work as a cheap source of labour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title = Coolie (Asian labourers) |url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/136194/coolie |accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=The Chinese American Experience:1857–1892 |url = http://immigrants.harpweek.com/ChineseAmericans/2KeyIssues/CoolieLabor.htm |accessdate = 29 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The British began shipping Indians to colonies around the world, including [[British Mauritius]], [[Colony of Fiji|British Fiji]], [[Colony of Natal|British Natal]], [[British East Africa]], [[Tanganyika (territory)|British Tanganyika]], [[British Somaliland]], [[Bechuanaland Protectorate|British Bechuanaland]], [[Seychelles|British Seychelles]], [[Uganda Protectorate|British Uganada]], [[Northern Rhodesia|British Northern Rhodesia]], [[Southern Rhodesia|British Rhodesia]], [[Nyasaland|British Nyasaland]], [[British Guiana]], [[Trinidad and Tobago#British rule|British Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Colony of Jamaica|British Jamaica]], [[Saint Lucia|British Saint Lucia]], [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]], [[Grenada]], [[British Honduras]], [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]], [[Barbados|British Barbados]], the rest of the [[British West Indies]], and [[British Malaya]]. The Dutch shipped workers to labor on the plantations on [[Surinam (Dutch colony)|Dutch Surinam]] the [[Netherlands Antilles]], and the [[Dutch East Indies]]. The French shipped laborers to [[Guadeloupe]], [[Martinique]], [[French Guiana]], the rest of the [[French West Indies]], and [[Réunion]].

A system of agents was used to infiltrate the rural villages of India and recruit labourers. They would often deceive the credulous workers about the great opportunities that awaited them for their own material betterment abroad. The Indians primarily came from the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain]], but also from [[Tamil Nadu]] and other areas to the south of the country.&lt;ref name="whkmla"&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.zum.de/whkmla/sp/0910/lse/lse2.html |title = History of Indian and Chinese Coolies and their Descendants |accessdate = 2013-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indians had faced a great number of social and economic disasters, causing them to be more eager than other groups to leave India. In the last part of the nineteenth century alone, there were 24 famines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Coolie Woman: The Odyssey of Indenture |last=Gaiutra |first=Bahadur |publisher=Chicago University Press |year=2014 |ISBN = |location=Chicago |page = 25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Without permission from the [[British Raj|British authorities]], the French transported Indian workers to their sugar producing colony, [[Reunion Island]], from as early as 1826. By 1830, over 3,000 labourers had been transported. After this trade was discovered, the French successfully negotiated with the British in 1860 for permission to transport over 6,000 workers annually, on condition that the trade would be suspended if abuses were discovered to be taking place.&lt;ref name=CoolieLabor18/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=St. Lucia's Indian Arrival Day|year=2009|publisher=Caribbean Repeating Islands|url=http://repeatingislands.com/2009/05/07/st-lucia’s-indian-arrival-day/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British began to transport Indians to [[Mauritius]] in the [[Indian Ocean islands|Indian Ocean]], starting in 1829. [[Slavery]] had been abolished, with the planters receiving two million pounds sterling in compensation for the loss of their slaves. The planters turned to bringing in a large number of [[Indentured servant|indentured labourers]] from India to work in the sugar cane fields. Between 1834 and 1921, around half a million indentured labourers were present on the island. They worked on sugar estates, factories, in transport and on construction sites.&lt;ref name=SouthAsianLabourers4&gt;{{cite web |title=Indian indentured labourers |publisher=The National Archives, Government of the United Kingdom |year=2010 |url = http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/records/research-guides/indian-indentured-labour.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1837, the [[East India Company|Raj]] issued a set of regulations for the trade. The rules provided for each labourer to be personally authorised for transportation by an officer designated by the Government, limited the length of service to five years subject to voluntary renewal, made the contractor responsible for returning the worker after the contract elapsed and required the vessels to conform to basic [[Occupational safety and health|health standards]].&lt;ref name="whkmla" /&gt;

[[File:Newly arrived coolies in Trinidad.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Newly arrived Indian coolies in [[Trinidad]].]]

Despite this, conditions on the ships were often extremely crowded, with rampant disease and [[malnutrition]]. Coolies were also not informed about the length of the trip or about the island that they would be going to.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The workers were paid a pittance for their labour, and were expected to work in often awful and harsh conditions. Although there were no large scale scandals involving coolie abuse in British colonies, workers often ended up being forced to work, and manipulated in such a way that they became dependent on the plantation owners so that in practice they remained there long after their contracts expired; possibly as little as 10% of the coolies actually returned to their original country of origin. Colonial legislation was also passed to severely limit their freedoms; in Mauritius a compulsory [[Internal passport|pass system]] was instituted to enable their movements to be easily tracked. Conditions were much worse in the French colonies of [[Réunion|Reunion]] and [[Guadeloupe]] and [[Martinique]], where workers were 'systematically overworked' and abnormally high [[mortality rate]]s were recorded for those working in the mines.&lt;ref name="whkmla" /&gt; Generally, Indian coolies were noted to have higher mortality rates as a whole, and were less likely to be able to return home.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Companies would often promise good food, durable clothing, adequate housing, safe passage, and schools. However, these promises were rarely kept, leading to the higher mortality rate and image of Indian coolies being "dirty".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The voyage itself was often a highly dangerous venture, especially for coolie women. Though some ships had made attempts to prevent assault, rape, and general mistreatment in sailor contracts, these indiscretions were still common. Even with punishments in place, on ship and land, men who assaulted women and children were rarely punished, leaving women in an even more vulnerable position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Coolie Woman: The Odyssey of Indenture|last=Bahadur|first=Gaiutra|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=51–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there were also attempts by the British authorities to regulate and mitigate the worst abuses. Workers were regularly checked up on by [[health inspector]]s, and they were vetted before transportation to ensure that they were suitably healthy and fit to be able to endure the rigours of labour. Children under the age of 15 were not allowed to be transported from their parents under any circumstances.&lt;ref name="whkmla" /&gt;

The first campaign against the 'coolie' trade in England likened the system of [[indentured labour]] to the slavery of the past. The campaign against coolie emigration was led by Joseph Sturge, with the Society of Friends. Petitions from Sturge, the Society of Friends, various other humanitarian groups, and from citizens of entire cities were routinely sent to the Colonial Offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Erickson |first=Edgar |date=June 1934 |title=The Introduction of East Indian Coolies into the British West Indies |url= |journal=The Journal of Modern History |volume=6 |page = 132  |doi=10.1086/236112}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this pressure, the labour export was temporarily stopped in 1839 by the authorities when the scale of the abuses became known, but it was soon renewed due to its growing economic importance. A more rigorous regulatory framework was put into place and [[Fine (penalty)|severe penalties]] were imposed for infractions in 1842. In that year, almost 35,000 people were shipped to Mauritius.&lt;ref name="whkmla" /&gt;

In 1844, the trade was expanded to the colonies in the [[West Indies]], including [[Jamaica]], [[Trinidad]] and [[Demerara]], where the Asian population was soon a major component of the island demographic.

[[File:H09620.jpg|thumb|right|Members of the [[Chinese Labour Corps]] carry out riveting work at the Central Workshops of the [[Royal Tank Regiment]].]]

Starting in 1879, many Indians were transported to [[Fiji]] to work on the [[sugar cane]] plantations. Many of them [[Indians in Fiji|chose to stay]] after their term of indenture elapsed and today they number about 40% of the total population. Indian workers were also imported into the Dutch colony of [[Suriname]] after the Dutch [[Anglo-Dutch Treaties of 1870–71|signed a treaty with the United Kingdom on the recruitment of contract workers]] in 1870. In Mauritius, the Indian population are now demographically dominant, with [[Indian festivals]] being celebrated as [[Culture of Mauritius#Public holidays and festivals|national holidays]].&lt;ref name="whkmla" /&gt;

This system prevailed until the early twentieth century. Increasing focus on the brutalities and abuses of the trade by the [[sensationalist]] media of the time, incited public outrage and lead to the official ending of the coolie trade in 1916 by the British government. By that time tens of thousands of Chinese workers were being used along the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] by the [[Triple Entente|allied forces]] (see [[Chinese Labour Corps]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.1914-1918.net/labour.htm The Long, Long Trail: The Labour Corps of 1917–1918]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sex ratios and intermarriage among coolies===

A major difference between the Chinese and the Indian coolie trades was that women and children were brought from India, along with men, while Chinese coolies were 99% male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=8|pages=|year=2008|accessdate=17 May 2014|publisher=Temple University Press|volume=|author=Lisa Yun|quote=|location=|title=The Coolie Speaks: Chinese Indentured Laborers and African Slaves in Cuba|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PWSC2ynmdgAC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=indian+coolie+woman+chinese+men&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Nm2TVfLJEIeQyQTRwrHgAw&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=indian%20coolie%20woman%20chinese%20men&amp;f=false|isbn=1592135838}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a high rate of Chinese men marrying women of other ethnicities like Indian women and mixed race Creole women.

With women as a severe minority, their morality was questioned and the actions of men as a result of having so few women was blamed on the women. Between 1858 and 1859, laws were put into place stating that the ratio of men to women could not exceed 2:1, whereas before it was 3:1. However, there continued to be a severe shortage of women. This gave women a new sense of power when it came to choosing a partner. With a shortage of women, it became the responsibility of the male suitor to provide a hefty dowry to a woman's father, regardless of what caste she came from.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Patricia Mohammd, "Gender Negotiations Among Indians in Trinidad, 917-1947," in ''The Caribbean History Reader'', ed. Nicola Foote (New York: Routledge, 2013), 192-194.&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, this also put women in a very vulnerable position, especially when alone. Rape was a common occurrence, and there were accounts of women being bound and gagged in their own home by men. Between 1872 and 1900, it was reported that 87 women were murdered with 65 of those being married women who were accused of being unfaithful.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The scarcity of Indian women in the Caribbean may not have been completely due to the women's inability to perform work required of them. Many coolie women saw the chance to leave for the Caribbean as a way to escape abusive husbands, to hide pregnancy, to escape shame, or to simply find a better life. The 1883 Indian Immigration Act aimed to stop women from escaping their abusive husbands, which in turn made it much more difficult for women to emigrate. This in part due to an agent generally needing to travel to the woman's village in order to verify who she was.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Coolie Woman: The Odyssey of Indenture|last=Bahadur|first=Gaiutra|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=26–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though there were crimes against women and women being murdered, these incidents were nowhere near as frequent as with Indian coolies. Though this was because there were so few Chinese, it became common for people to believe that Indians murder their women while Chinese women stay alive because, unlike their Indian counterparts, they are chaste.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Coolie Woman: The Odyssey of Indenture|last=Bahadur|first=Gaiutra|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=216–217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In Sri Lanka (sinhala), "kuliwada" is the term for manual labor. Also 'kuli' (e.g. Kuliyata) means working for a fee, notably instant (cash) payment (and not salaried). It is used in a derogatory/in-jest manner to signify biased action/support (e.g. Kuliyata andanawa = Crying for a fee [in colonial times people would be paid to cry at funerals]). Taxis are known as kuli-ratha.

==In art, entertainment, and media==

===Films===
In the 1957 film ''[[The Bridge on the River Kwai]]'', when his officers are ordered to participate in the construction of the bridge, British officer Col. Nicholson ([[Alec Guinness]]) declares that they will not be used as coolies by their captors. The enlisted men cheer when their social betters are excused the work.
[[Coolie (1983 Hindi film)|''Coolie'']] (1983) is an Indian film about a coolie, played by [[Amitabh Bachchan]], who works at a railway station and has a lover. His lover's father once murdered a girl's father in an attempt to force her to marry him, but she did not give in. After 10&amp;nbsp;years of imprisonment, he flooded her village (injuring her new husband) and causing her to awaken with amnesia. It also starred [[Rishi Kapoor]], [[Kader Khan]], [[Waheeda Rehman]] among others.

In the racially controversial film "[[The Mask of Fu Manchu]]" (1932) [[Sir Denis Nayland Smith]] mentions his team's temporarily hired Chinese workers at the 27:20 mark regarding [[Dr. Fu Manchu]], "... his spies are all around us. I can't even trust our own coolies."

The film "The Sand Pebbles" (1966) depicts coolies working as laborers assisting American sailors aboard an American gun boat in 1926 civil war era China. The story, among many parallel story lines, involves an American Navy engineer (Steve McQueen) befriending a coolie working under his command (Mako) in the engine room. The film was nominated for 8 Oscars. Richard Attenborough won the best supporting actor Golden Globe.

The film ''[[Romper Stomper]]'' (1992) shows a white power skinhead named Hando (played by [[Russell Crowe]]) expressing distress about the idea of being a coolie in his own country. Also, the gang he directs makes frequent attacks at gangs of working class Vietnamese Australians.

The documentary film directed by [[Yung Chang]] called ''[[Up the Yangtze]]'' (2007) follows the life of a family in China that is relocated due to the flooding of the Yangtze. The daughter is sent directly from finishing middle school to work on a cruise ship for western tourists, to earn money for her family. Her father referred to himself as a "coolie" who used to carry bags on and off of boats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://films.nfb.ca/up-the-yangtze/index.php |title=Up the Yangtze (Trailer) by Yung Chang – NFB |publisher=Films.nfb.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1955 film [[The Left Hand of God]] Father Carmody (Humphrey Bogart) in the testy exchange with Dr. Sigman, the mission Doc, (E G Marshall) reminds the physician he is not one of his “coolie” patients.

===Television===
In ''[[Hell on Wheels (TV series)|Hell on Wheels]]'' (e.g., [[Hell on Wheels (season 3)|season 3, episode 1]]), frequent references are made to the hardworking, underpaid Chinese coolies who helped build the [[Transcontinental Railroad]].

===Books===
In the 1899 novelette ''[[Typhoon (novel)|Typhoon]]'' by [[Joseph Conrad]], the captain is transporting a group of coolies in the South China Sea.
''[[White Coolies]]'' by [[Betty Jeffrey]] (1954) is a non-fiction account of a group of Australian nurses held captive and used as slave labour by the Japanese in WWII.

===Music===
The 2014 [[Chutney music|chutney]] song called ''Coolie Bai Dance'' by the [[Indo-Guyanese]] singer, Romeo "Mystic" Nermal, is about the lifestyle of the traditional, villager  "coolie" ([[Indo-Caribbean]]) people in [[Guyana]] and the rest of the [[Caribbean]].

=== Other ===
In 1938, U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt used the term in one of his "Fireside Chats" (Number 13, 24 July 1938) while telling a story about "Two Chinese coolies" arguing in a crowd.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5246">'''Denver Technological Center''', better known as '''The Denver Tech Center''' or '''DTC''', is a [[business]] and economic trading center located in [[Colorado]] in the southeastern portion of the [[Denver Metropolitan Area]], within portions of the cities of [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]] and [[Greenwood Village, Colorado|Greenwood Village]]. It is home to several major businesses and corporations. The DTC roughly corresponds to the area surrounding the [[Interstate 25 (Colorado)|I-25]] corridor between [[Interstate 225 (Colorado)|I-225]] and [[SH 88 (CO)|SH 88]] (Arapahoe Road).

==History==
[[File:DenverTechCenter.jpg|thumb|upright=2.4|alt=DTC skyline from the north at sunset|Skyline of the Denver Tech Center.]]
The DTC was established in the early 1970s.  Cable companies United Cablevision, United Artists Cable, and later [[AT&amp;T Broadband]], all had their start in - and still have major infrastructure around - the Denver Tech Center. In the Colorado area, [[Bill Daniels]] and [[John C. Malone]] were early adopters who shepherded many standards in cable technology still used today.

The Denver Tech Center was designed by architect/planner Carl A. Worthington.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl A. Worthington and Associates]], http://www.carlworthingtonassociates.com&lt;/ref&gt;  In the early 1970s, investors asked Worthington to complete a conceptual master plan along a new fiber optic line south of [[downtown Denver]].  The master plan started with forty acres, with potential for an additional 800 acres.  The plan has since grown to 850 acres, and over 25 million square feet of buildings have been completed.
The area's progress was a major reason for [[Denver Regional Council of Governments]]'s hi [[Colorado T-REX Project (TRansportation EXpansion)|T-REX expansion]] into the Denver Tech Center, which built new [[light rail]] lines connecting the Denver Tech Center to downtown Denver.&lt;ref&gt;Transportation Expansion (T-REX) Multi-Modal Transportation Project- [[Federal Highway Administration]]-T-REX, http://www.environment.fhwa.dot.gov/strmlng/casestudies/co.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Ernest Thomas Fisk''' (8 August 1886{{spaced ndash}}8 July 1965) was an [[English Australian]] businessman and entrepreneur who was the founder (1913) and later Managing Director (1916) and Chairman (1932) of [[Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia)]] (AWA). In 1944 was appointed Managing Director of the [[EMI]] music empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Goot|first=Murray|title=Fisk, Sir Ernest Thomas (1886–1965)|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/fisk-sir-ernest-thomas-6177/text10617|publisher=Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 September 1918 he proved the possibility of direct radio broadcasts from the UK to Australia by receiving the first such message at his Sydney home, 'Lucania'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ernest Fisk and the first wireless messages from the UK to Australia |url=http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/discover_collections/natural_world/.../people_places/north/professionals/fisk/index.html |publisher=[[State Library of New South Wales]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102200034/http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/discover_collections/natural_world/.../people_places/north/professionals/fisk/index.html |archivedate=2014-01-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A memorial was erected on 14 December 1935 to celebrate the achievement.

Throughout his career he held many key positions in the electronics industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article105760297|title=Pioneer of radio dies|date=1965-07-10|work=Canberra Times (ACT : 1926 - 1995)|access-date=2018-09-19|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s he predicted that color televisions would be in world-wide use within 30 years, and solar power would be used to cool and heat houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article79258898|title=EXPERT FORECASTS AIR-CONDITIONED HOMES BY SOLAR RAY USE|date=1956-01-12|work=Central Queensland Herald (Rockhampton, Qld. : 1930 - 1956)|access-date=2018-09-19|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fiskville, [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], about 10 kilometres south of [[Ballan, Victoria|Ballan]], is named after him. From 1927 to 1969 it was the location of the [[shortwave radio|shortwave wireless]] transmitting complex operated by AWA as part of the [[Imperial Wireless Chain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Former Australian Beam Wireless Transmitting Station|url=http://eheritage.metadata.net/record/VIC-44704|website=Australian e-Heritage Portal|accessdate=2016-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1211">An '''expeditor''' is someone who facilitates a process.  It is a position or role found within [[project management]], [[construction]], [[purchasing]] and [[production control]].  One example of this is a person in a restaurant who coordinates actions between cooks and wait staff in a restaurant, managing the flow of orders and giving real-time commands to other employees.

In a shipping logistics [[supply chain]], an expeditor's role is primarily to look at the requirement levels in the business and fulfill the demands by either rescheduling in or rescheduling out the delivery date on the [[purchase order]]. The expeditor is also responsible for making sure there is no line stopping situation for a business. The key metrics which an expeditor influences may be - Ontime Delivery, Cash Flow Cycle and Inventory Management. An expeditor needs to be assertive and needs to know the business at high contextual levels&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The high-tech career book|page=104|author=Betsy A. Collard|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also the name used for Beech 18 aircraft by British and Commonwealth air forces (1940s-50s).

Its main offices are located in [[Palo Alto, California]] and has its development centre in Bengaluru, India.

== History ==
Flutura was co-founded by Krishnan Raman, Srikanth Muralidhara, and Derick Jose, in February 2012.
Raman, formerly from [[Mindtree]], became the chief executive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Krishnan Raman: CEO, Flutura |work= E-Commerce Summit promotional site |publisher= VC Circle |url= http://events.vccircle.com/content/krishnan-raman |access-date= May 21, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The word 'Flutura' means butterfly in Albanian.
Flutura developed software called Cerebra, announced by 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Flutura Solutions: Help 'See' Previously 'Unseen' Patterns |date= October 3, 2013 |work= CIO Review |author= Benita Matilda |url= http://www.cioreview.com/crtech-india/10-most-promising-big-data-companies.html |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131016054947/http://www.cioreview.com/crtech-india/10-most-promising-big-data-companies.html |archivedate= October 16, 2013 |access-date= May 21, 2017 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Friedrich Karl Flick''' (3 February 1927 – 5 October 2006) was a German-Austrian [[industrialist]] and [[billionaire]].

==Early life==
He was born in Berlin,&lt;ref name=bloomberg /&gt; the youngest son of [[Friedrich Flick]] and Marie Schuss. After his studies, he worked in his father's company. In 1972, when his father died, he inherited the major part of the family business.

==Career==
As the sole owner of the Friedrich Flick Industrial Holding (Industrieverwaltung), he had interests in major companies including [[Daimler-Benz]], [[WR Grace]], Gerling Insurance, [[Buderus]], [[Dynamit Nobel]], Feldmühle and others.

In 1975 he sold his part of Daimler-Benz to the [[Deutsche Bank]] for more than $ 1 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/12/13/archives/bonn-bank-plans-benz-stock-sale-largest-german-institutior-forms-a.html |title=Bonn Bank Plans Benz Stock Sale |newspaper=New York Times |date=December 12, 1975 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Major tax liabilities were avoided through "cultivation of the political landscape",—a process that turned into the [[Flick Affair]] in 1983 when it became apparent that about $25 million had been paid to German political parties in return for tax cuts and favorable rulings. Although Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]] benefited from the dealings, he claimed he had "no recollections", while others resigned from their posts. In 1985 Flick sold off the remainder of his companies. When Deutsche Bank announced that it had bought his holdings for about $3 billion [[German mark]]s, Flick retired in Austria, where he became a naturalised citizen.

In March 2006, his estimated net worth was $6.1 billion.&lt;ref name=bloomberg&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thiel|first1=SImon|title=Flick, Billionaire Son of Nazi War Criminal, Dies (Update1)|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=ajNFph3pc0d8|accessdate=11 November 2015|work=bloomberg|date=6 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
He married three times and had two children from his second and third marriages. At the time of his death, he was the wealthiest person living in Austria.

He died on 5 October 2006 at his villa in [[Schiefling am See|Auen]] on the [[Wörthersee]], Austria.&lt;ref name=bloomberg /&gt;

In November 2008, it was reported that an oak coffin containing his remains was taken from his family's [[mausoleum]] at a cemetery at [[Velden am Wörther See]], in what [[Federal Police (Austria)|Austrian Federal Police]] believe may be an attempt to extort money from his widow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1087756/Body-Nazi-slave-billionaire-stolen-Austrian-cemetery-extortion-attempt.html|title=Body of 'Nazi slave' billionaire stolen from Austrian cemetery in 'extortion attempt'|publisher=Daily Mail|date=2008-11-20|accessdate=2008-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; His widow Ingrid Flick, his third wife, inherited an estimated £4bn. She and his children are now under police guard.  The body was returned in 2009.

Mason was the father of [[George Mason|George Mason IV]], a [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Father of the United States]].&lt;ref name=GH/&gt;&lt;ref name=FFA/&gt;&lt;ref name=AH/&gt;

==Early life==
Mason was born in 1690 at [[Chopawamsic (plantation)|Chopawamsic]] [[plantations in the American South|plantation]] in [[Stafford County, Virginia]].&lt;ref name=GH/&gt;&lt;ref name=FFA/&gt;&lt;ref name=AH/&gt; He was the eldest son of [[George Mason II]] and his first wife Mary Fowke.&lt;ref name=GH/&gt;&lt;ref name=FFA/&gt;&lt;ref name=AH/&gt;

==Planter and politician==
At the time of his father's death in 1716, Mason was 27 and already a man of prominence in Stafford County.&lt;ref name=Fburg/&gt; Like his father, Mason increased the family's property and social standing in Stafford County, and continued a tradition of leadership and public service.&lt;ref name=Fburg/&gt;&lt;ref name=MN&gt;{{cite web | url=http://masonneck.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2&amp;Itemid=2 | title=About Mason Neck  | date= | accessdate=2008-03-29 | publisher= Mason Neck Citizens Association | author=Mason Neck Citizens Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also like his father, Mason served as a colonel in the Stafford County militia and represented Stafford in the [[House of Burgesses]] between 1715 and 1726.&lt;ref name=Fburg/&gt;&lt;ref name=MN/&gt;&lt;ref name=TG&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.esva.net/ghotes/thorowgd/d0/i0017503.htm | title=Thorowgood: Fifth Generation | date= | accessdate=2008-03-29 | publisher=THOROWGOOD | author=THOROWGOOD}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during his tenure as a burgess in [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]] that Mason met and married his wife Ann Stevens Thomson.&lt;ref name=MN/&gt; He served as County Lieutenant of Stafford in 1719.&lt;ref name=TG/&gt; Mason also served as [[sheriff]] of Stafford County.&lt;ref name=Fburg/&gt;

Mason amassed enormous land holdings in Stafford, [[Fauquier County, Virginia|Fauquier]], [[Prince William County, Virginia|Prince William]], and [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax]] counties in Virginia.&lt;ref name=Fburg/&gt; Mason also increased his land holdings by acquiring large grants south of the [[Occoquan River]], which were later named [[Woodbridge (plantation)|Woodbridge]] by his grandson [[Thomas Mason (1770–1800)|Thomas Mason]].&lt;ref name=MN/&gt; Mason leased most of his properties out as smaller farms with their rent paid in [[tobacco]] yield.&lt;ref name=Fburg/&gt; Other sources of Mason's income came from fisheries and a ferry service carrying [[King's Highway (Charleston to Boston)|King's Highway]] across the [[Occoquan River]].&lt;ref name=Fburg/&gt;&lt;ref name=MN/&gt; Because Mason owned land on both sides of the Occoquan River, he enjoyed a [[monopoly]] on river crossings as well as on the fishing rights in [[Belmont Bay]].&lt;ref name=MN/&gt;

In 1716, Mason accompanied the "[[Knights of the Golden Horseshoe Expedition]]" led by Lt. Governor [[Alexander Spotswood]] across the [[Blue Ridge Mountains|Blue Ridge]] and into the [[Shenandoah Valley]].&lt;ref name=Fburg/&gt;

==Marriage and children==
Mason married Ann Stevens Thomson, daughter of Stevens Thomson and his wife Dorothea, in 1721.&lt;ref name=GH/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fburg/&gt;&lt;ref name=FFA/&gt;&lt;ref name=AH/&gt; The couple had three children:&lt;ref name=GH/&gt;&lt;ref name=FFA/&gt;&lt;ref name=AH/&gt;

*[[George Mason|George Mason IV]] (11 December 1725&amp;ndash;7 October 1792)&lt;ref name=GH/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fburg/&gt;&lt;ref name=AH/&gt;
*Mary Thomson Mason Selden (1731&amp;ndash;5 January 1758)&lt;ref name=GH/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fburg/&gt;&lt;ref name=AH/&gt;
*[[Thomson Mason]] (14 August 1733&amp;ndash;26 February 1785)&lt;ref name=GH/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fburg/&gt;&lt;ref name=AH/&gt;

A few years after his marriage to Ann, Mason moved his family to Stump Neck plantation in [[Charles County, Maryland|Charles County]], [[Maryland]], relegating the [[Chopawamsic (plantation)|Chopawamsic]] estate in Stafford County, Virginia, to a secondary residence.&lt;ref name=Fburg/&gt;

==Later life==
Mason died in a ferry accident on 5 March 1735 on the [[Potomac River]].&lt;ref name=Fburg/&gt;&lt;ref name=FFA/&gt;&lt;ref name=AH/&gt; Soon after his death, Mason's widow and children returned to Chopawamsic.&lt;ref name=Fburg/&gt; At the time of his death, Mason owned {{convert|20875|acre|km2}} in Stafford County alone.&lt;ref name=Fburg/&gt;

'''Isoelectric focusing''' ('''IEF'''), also known as '''electrofocusing''', is a technique for separating different [[molecules]] by differences in their [[isoelectric point]] (pI).&lt;ref name="BjellqvistEk1982"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bjellqvist|first1=Bengt|last2=Ek|first2=Kristina|last3=Giorgio Righetti|first3=Pier|last4=Gianazza|first4=Elisabetta|last5=Görg|first5=Angelika|last6=Westermeier|first6=Reiner|last7=Postel|first7=Wilhelm|title=Isoelectric focusing in immobilized pH gradients: Principle, methodology and some applications|journal=Journal of Biochemical and Biophysical Methods|volume=6|issue=4|year=1982|pages=317–339|issn=0165022X|doi=10.1016/0165-022X(82)90013-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Righetti2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pier Giorgio Righetti|title=Isoelectric Focusing: Theory, Methodology and Application|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nvs2kxOINWIC&amp;pg=PP2|date=1 April 2000|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-08-085880-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a type of zone [[electrophoresis]], usually performed on [[protein]]s in a [[gel electrophoresis|gel]], that takes advantage of the fact that overall charge on the molecule of interest is a function of the [[pH]] of its surroundings.

==Procedure==
IEF involves adding an [[Amphoterism|ampholyte]] solution into [[immobilized pH gradient]] (IPG) gels. IPGs are the acrylamide gel matrix co-polymerized with the pH gradient, which result in completely stable gradients except the most alkaline (&gt;12) pH values. The immobilized pH gradient is obtained by the continuous change in the ratio of ''immobilines''. An immobiline is a weak acid or base defined by its pK value.

A protein that is in a pH region below its [[isoelectric point]] (pI) will be positively charged and so will migrate towards the cathode (negatively charged electrode). As it migrates through a gradient of increasing pH, however, the protein's overall charge will decrease until the protein reaches the pH region that corresponds to its pI. At this point it has no net charge and so migration ceases (as there is no electrical attraction towards either electrode).  As a result, the proteins become focused into sharp stationary bands with each protein positioned at a point in the pH gradient corresponding to its pI. The technique is capable of extremely high resolution with proteins differing by a single charge being fractionated into separate bands.

Molecules to be focused are distributed over a medium that has a pH gradient (usually created by [[aliphatic]] [[ampholyte]]s). An [[electric current]] is passed through the medium, creating a "positive" [[anode]] and "negative" [[cathode]] end. Negatively charged molecules migrate through the pH gradient in the medium toward the "positive" end while positively charged molecules move toward the "negative" end. As a particle moves towards the pole opposite of its charge it moves through the changing pH gradient until it reaches a point in which the pH of that molecules isoelectric point is reached.  At this point the molecule no longer has a net electric charge (due to the protonation or deprotonation of the associated functional groups) and as such will not proceed any further within the gel. The gradient is established before adding the particles of interest by first subjecting a solution of small molecules such as [[ampholyte|polyampholyte]]s with varying pI values to electrophoresis.

The method is applied particularly often in the study of [[protein]]s, which separate based on their relative content of [[acidic]] and [[Base (chemistry)|basic]] [[Amino acid|residues]], whose value is represented by the pI. Proteins are introduced into an [[Immobilized pH gradient]] gel composed of [[polyacrylamide]], [[starch]], or [[agarose]] where a pH gradient has been established. Gels with large pores are usually used in this process to eliminate any "sieving" effects, or artifacts in the pI caused by differing migration rates for proteins of differing sizes. Isoelectric focusing can resolve proteins that differ in [[Isoelectric point|pI]] value by as little as 0.01.&lt;ref&gt;Stryer, Lubert: "Biochemie", page 50. Spektrum Akademischer Verlag, 1996 (German)&lt;/ref&gt; Isoelectric focusing is the first step in [[two-dimensional gel electrophoresis]], in which proteins are first separated by their pI and then further separated by [[molecular weight]] through [[SDS-PAGE]].

==Living cells==
According to some opinions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Flegr J |title=Does a cell perform isoelectric focusing? |journal=BioSystems |volume=24 |pages=127–133 |year=1990 |url=http://natur.cuni.cz/flegr/pdf/isoel.pdf |doi= 10.1016/0303-2647(90)90005-L |pmid= 2249006 |issue= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Baskin E.F. |author2=Bukshpan S |author3=Zilberstein G V |title=pH-induced intracellular protein transport |journal=Physical Biology |volume=3 |pages=101–106 |year=2006 |doi=10.1088/1478-3975/3/2/002 |pmid=16829696 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; living [[eukaryotic]] cells perform isoelectric focusing of proteins in their interior to overcome a limitation of the rate of metabolic reaction by diffusion of enzymes and their reactants, and to regulate the rate of particular biochemical processes. By concentrating the enzymes of particular metabolic pathways into distinct and small regions of its interior, the cell can increase the rate of particular biochemical pathways by several orders of magnitude. By modification of the isoelectric point (pI) of molecules of an enzyme by, e.g., [[phosphorylation]] or dephosphorylation, the cell can transfer molecules of the enzyme between different parts of its interior, to switch on or switch off particular biochemical processes.

==Microfluidic chip based==
Microchip based electrophoresis is a promising alternative to [[capillary electrophoresis]] since it has the potential to provide rapid protein analysis, straightforward integration with other microfluidic unit operations, whole channel detection, nitrocellulose films, smaller sample sizes and lower fabrication costs.

==Multi-junction==
The increased demand for faster and easy-to-use protein separation tools has accelerated the evolution of IEF towards in-solution separations. In this context, a multi-junction IEF system was developed to perform fast and gel-free IEF separations. The multi-junction IEF system utilizes a series of vessels with a capillary passing through each vessel.&lt;ref name = "pmid26531800" /&gt; Part of the capillary in each vessel is replaced by a semipermeable membrane. The vessels contain buffer solutions with different pH values, so that a pH gradient is effectively established inside the capillary. The buffer solution in each vessel has an electrical contact with a voltage divider connected to a high-voltage power supply, which established electrical field along the capillary. When a sample (a mixture of peptides or proteins) is injected in the capillary, the presence of the electrical field and the pH gradient separates these molecules according to their isoelectric points. The multi-junction IEF system has been used to separate tryptic peptide mixtures for two-dimensional proteomics &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Pirmoradian, M. |author2=Zhang, B. |author3=Chingin, K. |author4=Astorga-Wells, J. |author5=Zubarev R.A. |title=Membrane-assisted isoelectric focusing device as a micro-preparative fractionator for two dimensional shotgun proteomics |journal=Analytical Chemistry |volume=86 | issue = 12 |pages=5728–5732 |year=2014 |doi= 10.1021/ac404180e |pmid=24824042}}&lt;/ref&gt; and blood plasma proteins from [[Alzheimer’s disease]] patients for biomarker discovery.&lt;ref name = "pmid26531800"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Pirmoradian M. |author2=Astorga-Wells, J., Zubarev, RA. |title=Multijunction Capillary Isoelectric Focusing Device Combined with Online Membrane-Assisted Buffer Exchanger Enables Isoelectric Point Fractionation of Intact Human Plasma Proteins for Biomarker Discovery. |journal=Analytical Chemistry |volume=87 |issue=23 |pages=11840–11846 |year=2015 |pmid=26531800 |doi=10.1021/acs.analchem.5b03344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jean Pierre de Batz, Baron de Sainte-Croix''', known as the '''Baron de Batz'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://geneweb.inria.fr/roglo?lang=en;i=1760116 Jean Pierre de Batz&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; or '''de Bance''',&lt;ref&gt;"Histoire de la Convention Nationale, d'après elle-meme: précédée d'un tableau de la France monarchique avant la révolution", Volume 6 1835  by Léonard Gallois on page 294&lt;/ref&gt; (26 January 1754 &amp;ndash; 10 January 1822), was a [[France|French]] [[royalist]] and businessman. He was born in [[Goutz-les-Tartas]] ([[Gers]]), and died in Chadieu, near [[Vic-le-Comte]] ([[Puy-de-Dôme]]).

His life and actions in the service of [[Louis XVI]] inspired several popular novelists, including [[Baroness Orczy]] (''[[Eldorado]]'', 1913), [[Rafael Sabatini]] (''[[Scaramouche]]'', 1921) and more recently [[Juliette Benzoni]] (''Le Jeu de l'amour et de la mort'' series, 1999–2000).

==Biography==

===Royal agent===
Under the [[Constituent assembly#France|Constituent Assembly]], de Batz's reputation as a financier led to his 28 May 1790 appointment to the liquidation committee, which was responsible for clearing public accounts. It appears that de Batz conducted liquidations of fraudulent debts, sold to his friends who then reimbursed him. At the same time, he became a secret adviser to [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]], and organized the financing of a secret policy implemented at the Chateau de Tuileries under [[Armand Marc, comte de Montmorin]] to defend the monarchy, which continued until at least 10 August 1792. On his own account, de Batz advanced to Louis XVI a sum exceeding 500,000 livres. His best ally was the Minister of Finance, [[Étienne Clavière]], and under the guise of missions Clavière entrusted to him, de Batz made several voyages abroad between March 1792 and January 1793.

On January 21, 1793, de Batz tried in vain to raise the crowd in boulevard de Bonne Nouvelle to save the king from execution. Several royalists were killed, though de Batz managed to escape. He remained partially in hiding until he obtained a certificate of non-emigration in June 1793.

===Accusations of conspiracies===
At the end of October 1793, fraud was uncovered in the liquidation of the [[French East India Company]], and de Batz was named as the leader of a vast conspiracy against the fledgeling republic. According to a declaration made in prison by [[François Chabot]], de Batz had frequently met with leaders of the [[Paris Commune]] and the [[National Convention]], including [[Committee of Public Safety]] members [[Claude Basire]], [[Julien de Toulouse]] and [[Joseph Delaunay|Delaunay d'Angers]]. Chabot also asserted that de Batz had held talks with foreign bankers including [[Moses Dobruška|Junius Frey]] and his brother Emmanuel Frey (of Austria), Pierre-Jean Berthold de Prosly (of Brussels), Andres Maria de Guzman (of Spain), and Jacob Pereira (of Portugal). However, this de Batz plot was itself a conspiracy, a political-police operation which concentrated the attention of the Jacobins on the alleged dangers of de Batz and his accomplices to the Convention, with the aim of dissolving it.

At the time, de Batz was constantly traveling between the provinces and Switzerland, and learned that his friends and most of his relations had been arrested. Denunciations were gathered to build an indictment and support the imaginary conspiracy. On 14 March 1794, [[Hébertistes]], [[Jean-Baptiste du Val-de-Grâce, baron de Cloots|Clootz]], Pereira and Prosly were [[guillotine]]d. On April 5, [[Georges Danton]] and his friends were executed with Chabot, Basire, the abbot of [[Espagnac]], Guzman, and the Frey brothers.

Police files and de Batz's passport would later exonerate him, as de Batz was not in Paris at the time of the liquidation.

===After the Reign of Terror===
Returning to France, de Batz was involved in the [[13 Vendémiaire|royalist insurrection]] of 5 October 1795, and imprisoned.  After the [[Coup of 18 Fructidor]] (4 September 1797), he took refuge in [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]] where he owned a castle. Discovered, he was arrested, but escaped during his transfer to [[Lyon]] and fled to Switzerland. The [[French Consulate]] had him removed from the list of emigrants and he abandoned political activism, returning to live in Auvergne.

Under the [[Bourbon Restoration]], he was awarded the rank of [[maréchal de camp]] (field marshal) and the [[Order of Saint Louis|cross of St. Louis]] for his services, as well as the military command of [[Cantal]], which was revoked after the [[Hundred Days]] period.

Living in seclusion in [[Authezat|Chadieu]], near [[Vic-le-Comte]], he died on 10 January 1822.

== Literary representations ==
The character of the double agent, a supporter of the monarchy and member of a network of Royalist agents in France and abroad whilst masquerading as a staunch Republican, is a stock character in literature set during the French Revolution.  Through his activities, this character sends many revolutionaries to the guillotine, having them convicted of being anti-revolutionaries. Fictionalizations of de Batz appear in several novels:
*Jean de Batz is the hero of a series of novels by Juliette Benzoni, ''The Game of Love and Death''.
*The Baron de Batz appears in a few of ''[[The Scarlet Pimpernel]]'' series of books by [[Baroness Orczy]], playing the most prominent role in ''[[Eldorado (novel)|Eldorado]]''.
*He also appears as a major character in [[Raphael Sabatini]]'s novel, ''Scaramouche the Kingmaker'', and a minor character in ''The Lost King''.
*Jean de Batz is a lead character in the historic fiction novel ''Seed of Mischief'' by Willa Gibbs, 1953. The book revolves around the Dauphin, Louis-Charles (1785–1795).
There are also biographies of de Batz:
*''Marie Antoinette's henchman – the carrier of Jean de Batz, in french revolution'' by Meade Minnigerode (1936)
*''A Gascon Royalist in revolutionary Paris'' by Rodolph Stawell, reprinted from "Forgotten books".

Curry began his higher education at [[St. Johns River State College|St. Johns River Community College]], then transferred to the [[University of Florida]] and graduated ''summa cum laude'' with a degree in accounting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Monroe|first1=Nate|title=Curry transformed from minor player in GOP politics to formidable Brown challenger|url=http://jacksonville.com/news/2015-03-05/story/curry-transformed-minor-player-gop-politics-formidable-brown-challenger|website=Florida Times-Union|accessdate=March 26, 2016|date=March 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He married his wife, Molly, in 2005. They have three children: Boyd, Brook, and Bridgett.&lt;ref name="young"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.jaxdailyrecord.com/showstory.php?Story_id=543092|title=The story behind Lenny Curry's decision to run for Jacksonville mayor|author=Marilyn Young|date=June 3, 2014|publisher=Financial News &amp; Daily Record|accessdate=May 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:Micro-Pulling-Down-Method.png|thumb|right|Micro-pulling-down method]] --&gt;
The '''micro-pulling-down (µ-PD)''' method is a [[crystal growth]] technique based on continuous transport of the melted substance through micro-channel(s) made in a [[crucible]] bottom.  Continuous [[solidification]] of the melt is progressed on a liquid/solid interface positioned under the crucible.  In a steady state, both the melt and the crystal are pulled-down with a constant (but generally different) [[velocity]].

Many different types of crystal are grown by this technique, including  [[Yttrium aluminium garnet|Y&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[silicon|Si]], [[Silicon-germanium|Si-Ge]], [[Lithium niobate|LiNbO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], 
[[Sapphire|α-Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Yttria|Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Scandium(III) oxide|Sc&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], 
[[Lithium fluoride|LiF]], [[Calcium fluoride|CaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Barium fluoride|BaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Shaped Crystals: Growth by Micro-Pulling-Down Technique |editors=T.

==Crystal growth routine==
Standard routine procedure used in the growth of most of µ-PD crystals is well developed.  The general stages of the growths include:

*	charging of the crucible with starting materials (mixture of powders),
*	heating of the crucible until starting materials in the crucible are completely melted,
*	upward displacement of the seed until its contact with the meniscus or crucible,
*	formation of the meniscus and partial melting of the seed top,
*	correction of the shape of the meniscus through appropriate adjustment of crucible temperature and position of the seed crystal,
*	crystal growth through pulling of the seed in downward direction,
*	separation of the as grown crystal from the meniscus,
*	and cooling of the system (including the crystal and the crucible) to room temperature

==History==
The aeroplex was first developed specifically for aviation with the establishment of Bates Field in 1929. The City of Mobile acquired the land from then [[List of mayors of Mobile, Alabama|Mayor of Mobile]], Cecil F. Bates. Bates Field was Mobile's first municipal airport. The [[United States Army Air Corps]] purchased the airfield in 1938 and established the Brookley Army Air Field, later renamed [[Brookley Air Force Base]] in 1948. The name Bates Field was then reused for the new Mobile municipal airport located {{convert|10|mi|km}} northwest of the Brookley site, known today as the [[Mobile Regional Airport]]. Brookley Army Air Field employed 17,000 civilians during [[World War II]]. After the end of the war, the Brookley base was used as an [[Air Force Logistics Command|Air Materiel Command]]. The closure of the base was announced in 1964, with operations officially ceasing in June 1969. This left a civilian workforce of approximately 13,000 people, ten percent of the local workforce, without jobs.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|title=History|work=Brookley Aeroplex|url=http://www.brookleyaeroplex.com/aeroplex_history.php|accessdate=June 30, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120713013100/http://www.brookleyaeroplex.com/aeroplex_history.php|archivedate=July 13, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It represented the largest base closure in United States history up to that time.&lt;ref name="newhistory4"&gt;Thomason, Michael. ''Mobile : the new history of Alabama's first city'', pages 289-297. Tuscaloosa : University of Alabama Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-8173-1065-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site was returned to the city after the base closure. The city established the Mobile Airport Authority in 1972 for advisement on how to manage Brookley. It was formally created as an independent authority by the [[Alabama Legislature]] in 1982, charged with the management of both Brookley and the Mobile Regional Airport. The site was renamed '''Brookley Complex''' at this time. A new terminal building was completed in 1986. Attempting to capitalize off the site's unique mix of road, rail, water, and air transportation, the authority began a campaign during the late 1980s to recruit the aviation and aerospace industries to Brookley. This mission has continued to the present.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

==Airport==
A major component of the aeroplex is the [[Mobile Downtown Airport]], a general aviation facility. The airport elevation is {{convert|26|ft|m}}, and it has a [[control tower]] and two [[asphalt]]/[[concrete]] runways:

==Facilities and services==
The Mobile Aeroplex at Brookley is the largest industrial and transportation complex in the region, with approximately 70 companies employing about 3600. Notable tenants at Brookley include [[Airbus]] North America Engineering ([[EADS North America|Airbus Military North America]]'s facilities are at the Mobile Regional Airport), [[Continental Motors, Inc.|Continental Motors]], and [[ST Aerospace Mobile]].&lt;ref name="tenants"&gt;{{cite web |title=Tenants |work=Brookley Aeroplex |url=http://www.brookleyaeroplex.com/pdfs/tenants.pdf |archive-url=http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120904062251/http://www.brookleyaeroplex.com/pdfs/tenants.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 4, 2012 |accessdate=June 30, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ST Aerospace Mobile serves as a maintenance provider for Delta Air Lines (Airbus A-319/320), [[FedEx Express]], [[American Airlines]], and [[United Airlines]]. FedEx Express also uses the complex for three daily cargo flights from [[Memphis, Tennessee]].&lt;ref name="aircargo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Air Cargo |work=Brookley Aeroplex |url=http://www.brookleyaeroplex.com/airport_cargo.php |accessdate=June 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===EADS and Airbus===
On February 29, 2008, the [[United States Air Force]] announced that a partnership between [[Northrop Grumman]] and [[EADS North America]] had won first round of a contract to produce the new [[Northrop Grumman KC-45|KC-45]] [[Aerial refueling|aerial refueling tanker]] to replace the [[Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker]]. The contract would have been worth up to $40 billion with 179 planes to be delivered over the succeeding ten to fifteen years, with production of these aircraft at Brookley.&lt;ref name="eads"&gt;{{cite web|title=Northrop/EADS wins tanker contract|work="al.com."|url=http://blog.al.com/live/2008/02/wsj_reports_northropeads_wins.html|accessdate=June 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a formal protest from Boeing, the competition was reopened.   Although Northrop Grumman declined to bid (stating that it considered the RFP to be too heavily weighted in favor of [[Boeing]] and its planned [[Boeing 767]] entry), on April 20, 2010, EADS announced it was re-entering the competition on a stand-alone basis, and intended to enter a bid with the KC-45 with final assembly at Brookley.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kc45now.com/news-press-releases/04-20-2010.asp "EADS North America intends to submit proposal for U.S. Air Force tanker "] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100426114954/http://www.kc45now.com/news-press-releases/04-20-2010.asp |date=2010-04-26 }}, EADS North America press release, April 20, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  EADS also announced plans to move its [[Airbus A330|Airbus A330-200F]] freighter assembly line from France to Mobile as well if it got the contract. This time, however, Boeing won the contract in February 2011 and EADS did not contest the result.&lt;ref name="airbuscoming"&gt;{{cite news|title=Airbus is coming: Agreement approved for $600 million, 1,000-worker plant in Mobile |work=Press Register |date=June 30, 2012 |url=http://blog.al.com/live/2012/06/airbus_working.html |accessdate=June 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="airbusap"&gt;{{cite news|title=AP Source: Airbus plans factory in Alabama |work=Associated Press |date=June 28, 2012 |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ilbgwZQPAIBugje_S8gpQ3HinjPw?docId=586ed60429054be6b00883525ed789a8 |accessdate=June 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning on June 27, 2012, ''[[The New York Times]]'' and other news outlets reported that [[Airbus]], a subsidiary of [[EADS]], had decided to locate a new factory in Mobile for the manufacture of the Airbus A320.&lt;ref name="airbusap"/&gt;&lt;ref name="airbusnyt"&gt;{{cite news|title=Airbus Is Said to Plan a Factory in Alabama |work=The New York Times |date=June 27, 2012 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/28/business/global/airbus-said-to-plan-first-us-plant.html |accessdate=June 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The initial reports were confirmed by the ''[[Press-Register]]'', which reported on June 30, 2012 that the deal had been approved by Airbus.&lt;ref name="airbuscoming"/&gt;  The plans include a $600 million factory at the Brookley Aeroplex for the assembly of the A319, A320 and A321 aircraft, all part of the [[Airbus A320 family]]. It could employ up to 1,000 full-time workers when at full capacity. Construction began in the spring of 2013, with it becoming operable by 2015 and producing 40 to 50 aircraft per year by 2017.&lt;ref name="airbuscoming"/&gt;  The plan was formally announced by Airbus CEO [[Fabrice Brégier]] from the Mobile Convention Center on July 2, 2012.&lt;ref name="apconfirm"&gt;{{cite news|title=Airbus to Build 1st US Assembly Plant in Alabama |work=Associated Press |author=Melissa Nelson-Gabriel |date=July 2, 2012 |url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/officials-ala-airbus-plant-employ-1000-16690789#.T_HRzJHhcqN |accessdate=July 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbcconfirm"&gt;{{cite news|title=Airbus confirms its first US factory to build A320 jet |work=BBC News |date=July 2, 2012 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18675711 |accessdate=July 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A ground breaking ceremony for the factory was held on April 8, 2013.&lt;ref name="HeraldNet"&gt;http://www.heraldnet.com/article/20130408/BIZ/704089866&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 16, 2017, Airbus announced a partnership with [[Bombardier Aerospace]], taking over a majority share of the [[Bombardier CSeries]] airliner program. As a result of this partnership, Airbus plans to open an assembly line for CSeries aircraft in Mobile, particularly to serve the US market. This effort may allow the companies to circumvent high [[countervailing duties]] on the CSeries family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-16/airbus-to-buy-majority-stake-in-bombardier-c-series-jet-program|title=Airbus Snaps Up Bombardier Jet in New Challenge to Boeing|work=Bloomberg.com|date=2017-10-17|accessdate=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CSeries was renamed the Airbus A220 on 10 July 2018;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release |url= https://www.airbus.com/newsroom/press-releases/en/2018/07/airbus-introduces-the-a220-100-and-a220-300.html |title= Airbus introduces the A220-100 and A220-300 |date= 10 July 2018 |publisher= Airbus}}&lt;/ref&gt; deliveries from Mobile are expected to start in 2020, at an initial rate of four aircraft per month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://leehamnews.com/2018/06/08/airbus-c-series-deal-closes-july-1-presents-challenges-for-boeing-embraer/ |title= Airbus-C Series deal closes July 1; presents challenges for Boeing, Embraer |date= June 8, 2018 |work= Leeham News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5894">The [[New York (state)|New York]] '''Disability Benefits Law''' ('''DBL''') is article 9 of the Workers' Compensation Law (which is itself chapter 67 of the [[Consolidated Laws of New York]]) and creates a [[State disability benefits|state disability insurance]] program designed to provide employees with some level of income replacement in case of disability caused off-the-job.

==Eligibility==
To be required to have DBL coverage for its employees, a company must employ at least one person besides the proprietor within the state of [[New York (state)|New York]]. Full-time employees are eligible for coverage after four consecutive weeks of work, and part-time employees are eligible after their twenty-fifth day of employment.

Out of state employees can be covered under some DBL policies, but the employer must have some [[New York (state)|New York]] employees in order to attain DBL coverage.

==Cost and rates==
DBL [[insurance]] groups are divided up into those covering fewer than 50 employees and those with 50 or more employees.

Employers with less than 50 employees are written at rates which are fixed for all groups, but that vary from one insurance carrier to another. Rates for employers with less than 50 employees are usually written as a dollar cost per employee, per month. These rates are further divided into separate male and female rates (which are higher than the male rates), to reflect the impact that pregnancy has on DBL claims. Many carriers offer a discounted rate for employers willing to pay all of their premium at the beginning of the year. If a carrier offers this option, the rate will be expressed as a dollar amount per male per year, and per female per year.

Carriers are prevented by the state [[Worker's compensation]] Board from raising or lowering their rates for groups with fewer than 50 lives. If a carrier's overall loss ratio (claims paid divided by premium) for their groups with less than 50 employees is too low, then the [[Worker's compensation]] Board may force the carrier to lower their rates for all of the groups with fewer than 50 covered lives.

Employers with 50 or more employees are not given fixed rates, but will request a quote from various insurance carriers through an insurance agent or broker. These rates can vary considerably and are based on the overall risk factors of the case. Carriers are permitted to review these groups and increase or decrease the rates based on the claims paid to the group and the premiums that the group pays to the carrier. These reviews are generally conducted quarterly, and the carriers will issue letters to the policyholders and their insurance brokers indicating the proposed changes in rate.

Rates for cases with more than 50 employees are usually given as a dollar amount per employee, per month (called a "per capita rate") with no division into male- and female-specific rates, or as a dollar amount per $100 of covered payroll. Other, less common rate structures include offering a dollar amount per male and per female (as with the groups with less than 50 employees), and offering a dollar amount per $10 of benefit.

==Benefits==
As of 2006, DBL offers a benefit of 50% of weekly wages to a maximum of $170 per week of benefit. The normal waiting period for DBL benefits to start is seven days, and benefits can extend to a maximum duration of 26 weeks.

It is possible for carriers to offer benefits that extend beyond the statutory DBL coverage known as "enhanced" or "enriched" DBL. This extended coverage usually takes the form of a higher maximum benefit, but can also include shorter waiting periods or a longer maximum duration. Carriers take these factors into account when underwriting DBL coverage, and so enriched DBL is often more costly than statutory DBL coverage.

==Premium payment==
An employer is allowed, but not required, to collect contributions from its employees to offset the cost of providing benefits. An employee's contribution is computed at the rate of one-half of one percent of his/her wages, but no more than sixty cents a week (WCL §209).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wcb.ny.gov/content/main/offthejob/IntroToLaw_DB.jsp&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paid Family Leave==
In 2016, Governor Cuomo signed into law the Paid Family Leave policy. Starting January 1, 2018, the New York State Paid Family Leave Program provides New Yorkers job-protected, paid leave to bond with a new child, care for a loved one with a serious health condition or to help relieve family pressures when someone is called to active military service. Coverage for this benefit will generally be provided as a rider to the DBL insurance policy. For employers who are not required to have DBL coverage, PFL coverage may be obtained on a stand-alone basis. (NYCRR 380).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ny.gov/programs/new-york-state-paid-family-leave&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wcb.ny.gov/PFL/pfl-regs-text-summary-revised.jsp&lt;/ref&gt;

He was raised and educated in [[Livingston, Scotland]]. He made his first step into video games when he was 15, working for company SoftStone with his friend David Quinn. Bruty had done some projects for SoftStone when it went bust in 1984. In 1987 Bruty joined [[Probe Software]], where he met another notable industry figure [[David Perry (game developer)|David Perry]]. Together they formed a team, with Bruty as artist and Perry as programmer, making arcade classics such as [[Trantor: The Last Stormtrooper]], [[Savage (video game)|Savage]], [[Overlord (1990 video game)|Overlord]] and [[Dan Dare: Pilot of the Future|Dan Dare 3]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://zxspectrumgames.blogspot.com/2010/09/spectrum-games-programmer-interview.html Nick Bruty gives an interview to ZXSpectrum Games.com, 13 September, 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992 Perry and Bruty went to the American division of [[Virgin Interactive|Virgin Games]] where they worked on [[Global Gladiators]], [[Cool Spot]], [[Disney's Aladdin (Virgin Games video game)|Aladdin]] and [[The Jungle Book (video game)|The Jungle Book]]. In 1993 David Perry formed [[Shiny Entertainment]] in [[California]] and Bruty and some members of Virgin Games followed in after finishing The Jungle Book. While at Shiny, Bruty led the art direction on cult platformers [[Earthworm Jim (video game)|Earthworm Jim]] and [[Earthworm Jim 2|its sequel]], and in the Special Edition of Earthworm Jim the level "Big Bruty" was named after him. The finest hour of Bruty in Shiny came with 1997 hit shooter [[MDK (video game)|MDK]]. He was responsible for the idea of the game itself, the characters, and its humorous style.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nowgamer.com/print/feature/297 Nowgamer's interview with David Perry about making of MDK.]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/mdk/credits MDK's credits on MobyGames.]&lt;/ref&gt;

After MDK Bruty left Shiny and formed video game company [[Planet Moon Studios]] with other ex-Shiny employees Tim Williams and Scott Guest. The company since made notable [[Giants: Citizen Kabuto]], [[Armed and Dangerous (video game)|Armed and Dangerous]] (influenced by MDK) and [[Infected (video game)|Infected]]. In 2011 Planet Moon closed and the company's staff was acquired by online games developer [[Bigpoint Games]].

In March 2011 Bruty and ex-Planet Moon Studios lead programmer Richard Sun formed new game company [[Rogue Rocket Games]].

In March 2014 Bruty and Rogue Rocket Games announced First Wonder,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.first-wonder.com/Nick Bruty's website for First Wonder]&lt;/ref&gt; a spiritual sequel to Giants: Citizen Kabuto, and started a [[Kickstarter]] crowdfunding campaign for it on September 25, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/roguerocket/first-wonder Kickstarter page for First Wonder]&lt;/ref&gt; However the campaign was not funded and the project was canceled.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/roguerocket/first-wonder/posts/1383913 Update 8: The Future of First Wonder]&lt;/ref&gt;

He lives in [[San Francisco, California]], where Rogue Rocket Games HQ is placed.

[[File:Perforations US1940 issues-2c.jpg|right|364px]]

A '''perforation''' is a small hole in a thin material or web. There is usually more than one perforation in an organized fashion, where all of the holes are called a ''perforation''. The process of creating perforations is called '''perforating''', which involves [[puncturing]] the workpiece with a [[tool]].

Perforations are usually used to allow easy separation of two sections of the material, such as allowing [[paper]] to be torn easily along the line. [[Packaging]] with perforations in [[paperboard]] or plastic film is easy for consumers to open.   Other purposes include filtrating fluids, sound deadening, allowing light or fluids to pass through, and to create an aesthetic design.&lt;ref name="todd"&gt;{{Citation | first1 = Robert H. | last1 = Todd | first2 = Dell K. | last2 = Allen | first3 = Leo | last3 = Alting | year = 1994 | title = Manufacturing Processes Reference Guide | publisher = Industrial Press Inc. | pages = 103–104 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6x1smAf_PAcC | isbn = 0-8311-3049-0 | postscript =.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various applications include [[plastic film]]s to allow the packages to breathe, medical films, [[micro perforated plate]] and [[sound]] and [[vapor]] barriers.

==Processes==
===Pins and needles===
[[Image:Controlcard-crop.jpg|thumb|left|"Volcanic" perforations made with a needle punch]]
[[Image:Orientatiepaalperforatorpinnetjes Silva 433.JPG|thumb|right|A needle punch used in [[orienteering]]]]

Rotary pinned perforation rollers are precision tools that can be used to perforate a wide variety of materials. The pins or needles can be used cold or heated. Cold perforation tools include needle punches.

There are a handful of manufacturers that specialize in hot and cold needle perforation tooling and equipment. In materials that have [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] this can result in a "volcano" hole that is preferred in many applications.

Pinned rollers can be made from a variety of materials, including [[plastic]], [[steel]], and [[aluminum]].

In more [[brittle]] films, cold perforation can cause slitting rather than creating a round hole, which can jeopardize the material's integrity under pressure.  The solution to this is often heating the pin; i.e. hot pin perforation. Hot perforation melts a hole in the material, causing a reinforced ring around the hole. Hot needle perforation also assists when high density pin patterns are utilized, as the heat aids the perforation of the material.

===Die and punch===
Die and punch sets can be used for thicker materials or materials that require large holes; this process is the most common for [[metalworking]]. The workpiece is [[Shearing (manufacturing)|sheared]] by pressing (either by machine or hand tool) the [[Punch (tool)|punch]] through the workpiece and into the [[die (manufacturing)|die]]. The middle section of the workpiece is scrap; commonly known as the [[chad]] in paper and similar materials. The punch and die are shaped to produce the desired shaped hole. The clearance (the distance between the outside circumference of the punch and the inner circumference of the die) must be properly maintained to ensure a clean cut. [[Burr (metal)|Burr]]s are produced on the side of the workpiece that is against the die.&lt;ref name="todd"/&gt;

Common applications are fruit and vegetable bags, [[hole punch]]ing and [[ticket punch]]ing.

===Laser perforation===
[[Laser cutting]] can place many precise holes in a web. Laser perforations look similar in many respects to hot needle perforations. However, laser systems are expensive. The big advantage of laser perforation is the consistency of the hole size, compared to mechanical perforation. This is very important in [[Modified atmosphere|modified atmosphere packaging]] for fresh produce. The laser perforation is often carried out on [[roll slitting]] machines (slitter rewinder) as the printed material is slit down to the finished roll size.

==Applications==
[[Image:Stamp US 1954 2c Jefferson coil pair.jpg|right|240px|thumb|Perforation holes on a pair of coil stamps]]
[[File:Paper perforator.jpg|thumb|Paper perforator]]
Perforation frequently refers to the practice of creating a long series of holes or slits so that [[paper]] or [[plastic]]s can be torn more easily along a given line: this is used in easy-open [[packaging]].  Since the creation of perforation devices in the 1840s and 1850s, it has seen use in several areas.

[[Postage stamp]]s are one common application of this, where small round holes are cut in lines to [[postage stamp separation|create individual pieces]]. Perforations on stamps are rather large, in the order of a millimeter, in comparison other perforated materials often have smaller holes.

It is common for [[cheque-book]]s, [[notebook]]s and [[legal pad]]s to have perforations making it easier to tear out individual pages or [[leaf (books)|leafs]]. Perforation is used in ways to separate [[loose leaf]] (or even a form of [[graph paper]] from a [[ringed binder]]). A fine perforation next to the rings allows the page to be separated from the book with no [[confetti]].

[[Screwcap]]s on glass or [[plastic bottle]]s are sealed with a ring at the bottom of the cap attached by perforation. Twisting the cap has the effect of rupturing the material between the perforations and indicating that the original seal has been broken.

[[File:FortranCardPROJ039.agr.jpg|thumb|Perforated punch card]]
The edges of [[film stock]] are perforated to allow it to be moved precise distances at a time continuously.  Similarly, [[punched card]]s for use in [[loom]]s and later in [[computer]]s input and output devices in some cases were perforated to ensure correct positioning of the card in the device, and to encode information.

Perforation of steel strips is used in the manufacture of some [[zester]]s and [[rasp]]s.

Historically, perforation patterns other than linear were used to [[perfin|mark stamps]]. A series of patents had been issued in the late 19th Century for perforation machines to be used on rail lines for ticketing. Libraries and private collections used similar perforating stamps to mark ownership of books. End sheets, title pages, and image plates were punched with the namesake of the collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ala.org/lhrt/popularresources/lhrtnewsletters/fall2010|title=LHRT Newsletter|last=admin|date=2010-12-01|work=Library History Round Table (LHRT)|access-date=2017-06-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, similarly elaborate perforation patterns continue to be used in [[Control point (orienteering)|orienteering]].

Bread bags for some bread often have micro-perforations in the plastic, which is supposed to keep the bread fresh by releasing excess moisture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clearbags.com/bags/food/micro-perf|title=Micro-Perforated Bags|work=clearbags.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, bags of concrete use small perforations to allow air to escape while they are being filled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcement.com/product-news/05082015/Weight-of-cement-bags-reduced-by-BSW-Machinery-276/|title=Weight of cement bags reduced by BSW Machinery|work=World Cement}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''RW3 Technologies''' is a software company that provides [[SaaS]] field sales, survey, and reporting applications for the [[consumer packaged goods]] (CPG) industry.  It is headquartered in the Bay Area of California.

== History ==
RW3 Technologies was founded in the Bay Area by Bruce Nagle in 1992.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dvorak|first1=Phred|title=Do-It-Yourself Consulting: CEOs Gather to Swap Tips|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118541288405378455|accessdate=9 July 2015|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date=26 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company's primary focus was to streamline daily data entry processes for the sales industry.

In 1992, RW3 introduced one of the first Land-Line CPG broker sales systems that allowed for mobile data entry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Borrego|first1=Annie Marie|title=Start-up Springboards|url=http://www.inc.com/magazine/20001015/20778.html|website=Inc.|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially used in food brokerage, though eventually expanded to include functionality for the [[Consumer Packaged Goods|consumer packaged goods]] industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Costello|first1=Daniel|title=Curing An Open Wound|url=http://www.destinationcrm.com/Articles/Older-Articles/The-Edge/Curing-An-Open-Wound-48561.aspx|website=Destination CRM|publisher=CRM Magazine|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the company expanded its [[business model]] to include [[B2B e-commerce|business-to-business]] account management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ackerman|first1=Alliston|title=National Tobacco Company Undergoes Sales Force Evolution|url=http://consumergoods.edgl.com/news/National-Tobacco-Company-Undergoes-Sales-Force-Evolution79917/|accessdate=24 July 2015|agency=Consumer Goods Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2010, the company began development of their first general [[SaaS]] product application since the late 1990s; the SaaS application called InStore Mobile (now MarketCheck) was released in 2011. The in-store survey application allows for two-way communication between the account rep and broker, allowing organizations to improve and track retail conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SMB Standout's - King's Hawaiian|url=http://www.consumergoods-digital.com/consumergoodstechnology/april_2015#pg7|accessdate=24 July 2015|agency=CGT|publisher=Edgell Communication}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rational egoism''' (also called '''rational selfishness''') is the principle that an action is rational if and only if it maximizes one's self-interest.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Baier (1990), p. 201; Gert (1998), p. 69; Shaver (2002), §3; Moseley (2006), §2.&lt;/ref&gt; The view is a [[Norm (philosophy)|normative]] form of [[wikt:egoism|egoism]]. It is distinct from [[psychological egoism]] (according to which people are ''motivated'' only to act in their own self-interest) and [[ethical egoism]] (that moral agents ''ought'' only to do what is in their own self-interest).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Philosophy ==
Rational egoism was embodied by Russian author [[Nikolay Chernyshevsky]] in the 1863 book ''[[What Is to Be Done? (novel)|What Is to Be Done?]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrzej Walicki|author2=Hilda Andrews-Rusiecka|title=A History of Russian Thought: From the Enlightenment to Marxism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ev4ad5wKI9oC&amp;pg=PA196|year=1979|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-1132-6|pages=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chernyshevsky's standpoint was ultimately socialistic, and was criticised by [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] in the 1864 book ''[[Notes from Underground]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Case against Rational Egoism in Dostoevsky's Notes from Underground |author=James P. Scanlan |journal=Journal of the History of Ideas |volume=60 |issue=3 |date=July 1999 |pages=549–67 |doi=10.1353/jhi.1999.0028}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/underground/context.html |title=SparkNotes: Notes from Underground: Context |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=[[SparkNotes]] |publisher= |access-date=2015-05-30 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

English philosopher [[Henry Sidgwick]] discussed rational egoism in his book ''[[The Methods of Ethics]]'', first published in 1872.&lt;ref&gt;Sidgwick (1907)&lt;/ref&gt; A method of ethics is "any rational procedure by which we determine what individual human beings 'ought' – or what it is 'right' for them – to do, or seek to realize by voluntary action".&lt;ref&gt;Sidgwick (1907), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Sidgwick considers three such procedures, namely, rational egoism, dogmatic intuitionism, and [[utilitarianism]]. Rational egoism is the view that, if rational, "an agent regards quantity of consequent pleasure and pain to himself alone important in choosing between alternatives of action; and seeks always the greatest attainable surplus of pleasure over pain".&lt;ref&gt;Sidgwick (1907), p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

Sidgwick found it difficult to find any persuasive reason for preferring rational egoism over [[utilitarianism]]. Although utilitarianism can be provided with a rational basis and reconciled with the morality of common sense, rational egoism appears to be an equally plausible doctrine regarding what we have most reason to do. Thus we must "admit an ultimate and fundamental contradiction in our apparent intuitions of what is Reasonable in conduct; and from this admission it would seem to follow that the apparently intuitive operation of Practical Reason, manifested in these contradictory judgments, is after all illusory".&lt;ref&gt;Sidgwick (1907), p. 508&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ayn Rand ==
The author and philosopher [[Ayn Rand]] also discusses a theory that she called 'rational egoism'. She holds that it is both irrational and immoral to act against one's self-interest.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2006); Moseley (2006), §2a.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, her view is a conjunction of both rational egoism (in the standard sense) and [[ethical egoism]], because according to [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivist philosophy]], egoism cannot be properly justified without an [[epistemology]] based on [[rationality|reason]]:

Her book ''[[The Virtue of Selfishness]]'' (1964) explains the concept of rational egoism in depth. According to Rand, a rational man holds his own life as his highest value, rationality as his highest [[virtue]], and his happiness as the final purpose of his life.

Conversely, Rand was sharply critical of the [[ethical altruism|ethical doctrine of altruism]]:

{{quote|Do not confuse altruism with kindness, good will or respect for the rights of others. These are not primaries, but consequences, which, in fact, altruism makes impossible. The irreducible primary of altruism, the basic absolute is ''self-sacrifice'' – which means self-immolation, self-abnegation, self-denial self-destruction – which means the ''self'' as a standard of evil, the ''selfless'' as a standard of the good.
Do not hide behind such superficialities as whether you should or should not give a dime to a beggar. This is not the issue. The issue is whether you ''do'' or do ''not'' have the right to exist ''without'' giving him that dime. The issue is whether you must keep buying your life, dime by dime, from any beggar who might choose to approach you. The issue is whether the need of others is the first mortgage on your life and the moral purpose of your existence. The issue is whether man is to be regarded as a sacrificial animal. Any man of self-esteem will answer: ''No.'' Altruism says: ''Yes.''"&lt;ref&gt;Ayn Rand, "Faith and Force: Destroyers of the Modern World," ''Philosophy: Who Needs it'', 1982, New American Library, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Criticism==
Two objections to rational egoism are given by the English philosopher [[Derek Parfit]], who discusses the theory at length in ''[[Reasons and Persons]]'' (1984).&lt;ref&gt;D. Parfit (1984), parts II and III&lt;/ref&gt; First, from the rational egoist point of view, it is rational to contribute to a [[pension scheme]] now, even though this is detrimental to one's present interests (which are to spend the money now). But it seems equally reasonable to maximize one's interests now, given that one's reasons are not only relative to him, but to him as he is now (and not his future self, who is argued to be a "different" person). Parfit also argues that since the connections between the present mental state and the mental state of one's future self may decrease, it is not plausible to claim that one should be indifferent between one's present and future self.

The "[[Gene-centered view of evolution|selfish gene]]" model of [[evolution]] suggests that human (and animal) behaviors that seem altruistic are actually selfish, if viewed from the perspective of [[Gene|genes]]/[[Phenotype|phenotypes]].  People help each other "selflessly" because copies of their own genes also exist in others, so behaviors that help the genes survive are [[Natural selection|selected]] for, with the altruistic drive [[Kin selection|decreasing with genetic distance]].

'''Reynolds Group Holdings''' is an American packaging company with roots in the former '''Reynolds Metals Company''', which was the second-largest [[aluminum]] company in the [[United States]], and the third-largest in the world.  Reynolds Metals was acquired by [[Alcoa]] in June 2000.
  
Reynolds Metals became known for the consumer product [[Reynolds Wrap]], as well as for developing and promoting new uses for aluminum. Its RV ''[[Aluminaut]]'' submarine was operated by Reynolds Submarine Services Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hnsa.org/ships/aluminaut.htm|title=Historic Naval Ships Association|work=Historic Naval Ships Association|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208010812/http://www.hnsa.org/ships/aluminaut.htm|archivedate=2006-12-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was headquartered for most of its existence in [[Richmond, Virginia]], and after 1958 in the [[Modernist architecture|Modernist style]] [[Reynolds Metals Company International Headquarters]] built there.

==History==
The Reynolds Metals Company was founded in 1919 as the U.S. Foil Company in [[Louisville, Kentucky]] by [[Richard S. Reynolds, Sr.]], nephew of tobacco king [[R. J. Reynolds]]. Initially, the new company supplied lead and tin foil wrappers to cigarette and candy companies. In 1924, U.S. Foil purchased the manufacturer of [[Eskimo Pie]]s, which were wrapped in foil. In 1928, Reynolds purchased Robertshaw Thermostat, Fulton Sylphon, and part of Beechnut Foil, adding them to U.S. Foil to create Reynolds Metals. In 1931 the company headquarters was moved to [[New York City]] and in 1938 the headquarters was moved again to [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], [[Virginia]].

The company began producing [[aluminum foil]] for packaging in 1926. Reynolds Metals created the first high-speed, gravure-printed foil, aluminum bottle labels, heat-sealed foil bags for foods and foil-laminated building insulation paper. In 1940 Reynolds Metals began mining [[bauxite]] (aluminum ore) in [[Bauxite, Arkansas|Bauxite]], [[Arkansas]] and opened its first aluminum plant near [[Sheffield, Alabama]], the following year. In 1947, the company released Reynolds Wrap Aluminum Foil. Reynolds Metals pioneered the development of aluminum siding in 1945, and Richard S. Reynolds began predicting a growing demand for additional aluminum during peacetime. He believed new aluminum-producing facilities would need to be built to meet demand. Reynolds Metals Company leased, and later bought, six government defense plants that were up for disposal. Reynolds later expanded into non aluminum products such as plastics and precious metals, introducing Reynolds Plastic Wrap in 1982.

After the Second World War, the sense of aluminum's utility expanded to include its ornamental characteristics. By repurposing military by-products into consumer goods, aluminum was now being marketed for its decorative appeal as well, creating a product of both functional and eye-catching qualities.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ong Yan|first=Grace|year=2012|title=Wrapping Aluminum at the Reynolds Metals Company|url=|journal=Design and Culture|volume=4|issue=3|pages=299–323|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reynolds advertised aluminum for its multi-faceted property, now reaching areas of fashion, home improvement, and architecture.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Reynolds marketed aluminum foil as gift wrap, aluminum yarn for Vogue dress patterns, and even extended their advertising strategy to include wrapping their office headquarters in aluminum.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Four sons of founder Richard S. Reynolds, [[William Gray Reynolds]], [[Richard S. Reynolds, Jr.]], [[David P. Reynolds]], and [[J. Louis Reynolds]], were all part of the running of the business. Richard S. Reynolds, Jr. succeeded his father as president in 1948 and under his leadership, the company underwent a major expansion with operations extended to countries around the world such as [[Venezuela]] and the [[Philippines]]. In 1976 David P. Reynolds, also known for his involvement in [[Thoroughbred horse racing]], took over as president. He was the last member of his family to head the company and would retire as chairman.

Reynolds Metals developed other, less well-known products. Not all became commercially viable, such as an aluminum bus developed with [[Rohr Industries]], and other aluminum motor vehicles. The aluminum vehicles were surpassed in weight and cost by steel, plastics and fiberglass. However, when Reynolds Metals developed the world's first aluminum submarine,  the ''[[Aluminaut]]'', the experimental product participated in a key rescue.&lt;ref name="The New York Times"&gt;{{cite news |title= Research vessel to explore deep|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1964/08/30/research-vessel-to-explore-deep.html?_r=0|work=[[The New York Times]] |date= August 30, 1964|accessdate= January 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, ''Aluminaut'' rescued ''[[Alvin (DSV-2)]]''. Aluminaut's assistance enabled [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]] to continue operating its submersible. Alvin's work continues 45 years later.&lt;ref name="Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution"&gt;{{cite web |title= History of Alvin|url=http://www.whoi.edu/page.do?pid=10737|work=[[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]]|date= December 2014|accessdate= January 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1991, Reynolds Metals employed 30,800 workers at more than 100 operations in 20 countries, including 64 plants in the United States, and had a total production capacity of more than 1 million tons of aluminum and aluminum products. The company was acquired by [[Alcoa]] on May 3, 2000 to become the largest aluminum company in the United States.

On January 21, 2008 Alcoa sold its consumer unit to [[Rank Group Ltd]]. Rank's owner, New Zealand billionaire [[Graeme Hart]], renamed Alcoa's former unit the Reynolds Packaging Group. Hart merged his other packaging companies into Reynolds to create Reynolds Group Holdings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alcoa.com/global/en/news/news_detail.asp?pageID=20080229005514en&amp;newsYear=2008|title=Alcoa: News: News Releases: Alcoa Completes Sale of Packaging and Consumer Businesses To New Zealand's Rank Group|website=Alcoa.com|accessdate=2016-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an initiative led by Paul D. Thomas, Reynolds Packaging Group chief executive officer and a former Alcoa executive, on September 21, 2008, Reynolds announced that one of the foil plants that produced Reynolds Wrap, in downtown Richmond, Virginia, would be closed and foil operations moved to Louisville, Kentucky, where Reynolds Wrap first was produced. A small portion of the spooling operation from the Richmond Foil plant was moved to the Reynolds plant in Grove City, Pennsylvania, in early 2010. Hart later closed five other plants within Reynolds. As a reflection of the recessionary times, salaries were frozen and salaried employees were not given pay raises. Union employees with fixed compensation contracts did receive incentive compensation. In early 2010 all pay was unfrozen. Salaried employees have since received pay adjustments.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

==Headquarters==
The former [[Reynolds Metals Company International Headquarters]] building is  in [[Henrico County]] near [[Richmond, Virginia]]. Built in 1958, is a [[Modernist architecture|Modernist]] building designed by the architect [[Gordon Bunshaft]] of [[Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill]]. During its use by Reynolds, the Executive Office Building was known as Reynolds EXO. It was named to the [[National Register of Historic Places]], one of the rare mid−20th century buildings on the list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dhr.virginia.gov/historic-registers/043-0242/ |format=PDF |title=National REgister of Historic Places : Reynolds Metals Company International Headquarters |website=Dhr.virginia.gov |accessdate=2016-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/VA/Henrico/state.html National Register properties in Henrico County, VA] Properties are generally eligible for inclusion 50 years after construction.&lt;/ref&gt; Making extensive use of [[aluminum]], down to threads in the carpeting, it is now owned by the [[University of Richmond]] and serves as the worldwide headquarters of [[Altria Group]].

==Consumer products==
[[Reynolds Wrap]] was first made by a Reynolds Metals Company division, Reynolds Packaging, a business created to supply aluminum foil for packaging [[tobacco]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philly.com/philly/news/20090524_How_a_Downingtown_printing_plant_failed_after_50_years.html?page=2&amp;c=y ]{{dead link|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Alcoa purchased Reynolds Metals, it shed some non-metals packaging and printing businesses but preserved the Reynolds consumer brand, as well as the Reynolds Kitchens, which are still across the street from the former Reynolds headquarters building. Alcoa's Reynolds division was a leader in household baking and cooking products, which included Cut-Rite Wax Paper.

Reynolds published cookbooks such as ''Outdoor Cooking with Reynolds Wrap'' (1950) and ''Casual Cooking'' (1954) in an attempt to promote the sales of Reynolds Wrap.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1958, the company launched the "Designs for Giving" campaign, in which professional artists and designers were hired to create special patterns for gift wrapping. Designs included "Birds and Bees" for baby showers, "Born Lucky, Born Rich" for birthdays, and "Flight of Fancy" for weddings or Christmas.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Samuel Herbert Pearse''', F.R.C.I. (born November 20, 1865) was a pioneer [[Nigerian]] [[Shipment|shipper]] and produce exporter of [[Sierra Leonean]] and [[Egba people|Egba]] heritage. He established the first Hotel in [[Lagos]] in 1907. He was also a member and secretary of the Lagos branch of the [[Anti-Slavery and Aborigines Protection Society]].

==Life and career==
He was born on November 20, 1865 to the family of Reverend R. Pearse of the [[Church Missionary Society]]. He attended [[C.M.S. Grammar School, Lagos]] for secondary education and started work as an [[apprentice]] in 1883. In 1888, he teamed up with Sierra Leonean businessman, I. Thompson and the two began trading in Lagos and London. However, both men parted ways in 1894. Pearse soon started his own trading account in Calabar and Lagos and also became an agent for the African and Gold Coast Trading Company.&lt;ref name="Walter Wills"&gt;Walter H Wills, R J Barrett.

Routledge &amp; sons, 1905. p 127.&lt;/ref&gt; He made extensive wealth trading in palm produce from the Old [[Calabar]] province as one of the pioneer Nigerian exporters of goods. He acquired a large steamship prior to World War 1, and succeeded in the lucrative shipping market dominated regionally by the [[Elder Dempster]] company. He later delved into the [[rubber]] business in [[Benin]] and focused more on importing goods.&lt;ref name="Tom Forrest"&gt;Tom G. Forrest.

[[File:Singapore Science Park II 4, Nov 06.JPG|thumb|Singapore Science Park II]]

'''Singapore Science Park''' ([[Simplified Chinese|Chinese]]: 新加坡科学园; {{lang-ms|Taman Sains Singapura}}) is a research, development and technologies hub in [[Singapore]]. Managed by [[Ascendas]], it was set up under a government initiative in 1980 to provide an infrastructure for retail and development to flourish in [[Singapore]].

==Milestones==
===Singapore Science Park I===
In 1980, the Government gave its seal of approval to proceed with the construction of the Singapore Science Park on a 30-hectare plot of land. In 1982, Singapore Science Park I welcomed its first tenant, [[Det Norske Veritas]] (DNV).

===Singapore Science Park II===
In 1993, construction of Singapore Science Park II began on a 20-hectare plot of land, the first building constructed was the [[Institute of Microelectronics]] (IME). The Alpha, a multi-tenant building was the next building constructed in Singapore Science Park II.

In 2000, Arcasia would expand and develop a 15-hectare plot of land next to the Singapore Science Park II into a Singapore Science Park III at a cost of about $600 million.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/data/pdfdoc/2000042004/lss20000420l.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was revealed that the latter was an expansion of Singapore Science Park II. Galen, the first building on the Singapore Science Park II's expanded plot was completed on 29 June 2003.

==Overview==
The Singapore Science Park, one of the earliest parks founded in economies at the developing stage, is ranked the second most popular in the Asia Pacific region.

{{Primary sources|date=April 2011}}

The '''twelve leverage points to intervene in a system''' were proposed by [[Donella Meadows]], a scientist and system analyst focused on environmental limits to economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Meadows |first=Donella |date=2008 |title=Thinking in Systems: A Primer |publisher=[[Chelsea Green Publishing]] |page=145-165 |isbn=978-1-60358-055-7 |author-link=Donella Meadows }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The leverage points, first published in 1997, were inspired by her attendance at a [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) meeting in the early 1990s where she realized that a very large new system was being proposed but the mechanisms to manage it were ineffective.

Meadows, who worked in the field of [[systems analysis]], proposed a scale of places to intervene in a [[system]].  Awareness and manipulation of these levers is an aspect of [[self-organization]] and can lead to [[collective intelligence]].

Her observations are often cited in [[energy economics]], [[green economics]] and [[human development theory]].

She started with the observation that there are levers, or places within a [[complex system]] (such as a firm, a city, an economy, a living being, an [[ecosystem]], an [[ecoregion]]) where a "small shift in one thing can produce big changes in everything" (compare: constraint in the sense of [[Theory of Constraints]]).

She claimed we need to know about these ''shifts'', where they are and how to use them. She said most people know where these points are instinctively, but tend to adjust them in the wrong direction. This understanding would help solve global problems such as [[unemployment]], [[hunger]], [[economic stagnation]], [[pollution]], [[resources depletion]], and [[Conservation ethic|conservation]] issues.

Meadows started with a 9-point list of such places, and expanded it to a list of ''twelve leverage points'' with explanation and examples, for systems in general.

She describes a [[system]] as being in a certain state, and containing a [[Stock and flow|stock]], with inflows (amounts coming into the system) and outflows (amounts going out of the system). At a given time, the system is in a certain perceived state. There may also be a [[goal]] for the system to be in a certain state. The difference between the current state and the goal is the discrepancy.

{{quote|For example, one might consider a [[lake]] or reservoir, which contains a certain amount of water. The inflows are the amount of water coming from rivers, rainfall, drainage from nearby soils, and waste water from a local industrial plant. The outflows might be the amount of water used up for irrigation of nearby cornfield, water taken by that local plant to operate as well as the local camping site, water [[evaporating]] in the [[atmosphere]], and trickling surplus water when the reservoir is full.

Local inhabitants complain about the water level getting low, pollution getting higher, and the potential effect of hot water release in the lake on life (in particular, the fish).

This is the difference between the perceived state (pollution or low water level) and the goal (a non-polluted lake).}}

==Leverage points to intervene in a system==
The following are in increasing order of effectiveness.

=== 12. Constants, parameters, numbers (such as subsidies, taxes, standards) ===

Parameters are points of lowest leverage effects. Though they are the most clearly perceived among all leverages, they rarely change behaviors and therefore have little long-term effect.

{{quote|For example, climate parameters may not be changed easily (the amount of rain, the [[evapotranspiration]] rate, the temperature of the water), but they are the ones people think of first (they remember that in their youth, it was certainly raining more). These parameters are indeed very important. But even if changed (improvement of upper river stream to canalize incoming water), they will not change behavior much (the debit will probably not dramatically decrease).}}

=== 11. The size of buffers and other stabilizing stocks, relative to their flows ===

A [[wiktionary:Buffer|buffer]]'s ability to stabilize a system is important when the stock amount is much higher than the potential amount of inflows or outflows.  In the lake, the water is the buffer:  if there's a lot more of it than inflow/outflow, the system stays stable.

{{quote|For example, the inhabitants are worried the lake fish might die as a consequence of hot water release directly in the lake without any previous cooling off.

However, the water in the lake has a large [[heat capacity]], so it's a strong thermic buffer. Provided the release is done at low enough depth, under the [[thermocline]], and the lake volume is big enough, the buffering capacity of the water might prevent any extinction from excess temperature.}}

Buffers can improve a system, but they are often physical entities whose size is critical and can't be changed easily.

=== 10. Structure of material stocks and flows (such as transport network, population age structures)===

A system's structure may have enormous effect on operations, but may be difficult or prohibitively expensive to change. Fluctuations, limitations, and bottlenecks may be easier to address.

{{quote|For example, the inhabitants are worried about their lake getting polluted, as the industry releases chemical pollutants directly in the water without any previous treatment. The system might need the used water to be diverted to a [[Industrial wastewater treatment|wastewater treatment plant]], but this requires rebuilding the underground used water system (which could be quite expensive).}}

=== 9. Length of delays, relative to the rate of system changes ===

Information received too quickly or too late can cause over- or underreaction, even oscillations.

{{quote|For example, the city council is considering building the wastewater treatment plant. However, the plant will take 5 years to be built, and will last about 30 years. The first delay will prevent the water being cleaned up within the first 5 years, while the second delay will make it impossible to  build a plant with exactly the right capacity.}}

=== 8. Strength of negative feedback loops, relative to the effect they are trying to correct against===

A [[negative feedback]] loop slows down a process, tending to promote stability. The loop will keep the stock near the goal, thanks to parameters, accuracy and speed of information feedback, and size of correcting flows.

{{quote|For example, one way to avoid the lake getting more and more polluted might be through setting up an additional levy on the industrial plant based on measured concentrations of its effluent.  Say the plant management has to pay into a water management fund, on a weekly or monthly basis, depending on the actual amount of waste found in the lake; they will, in this case, receive a direct benefit not just from reducing their waste output, but actually reducing it enough to achieve the desired effect of reducing concentrations in the lake.  They cannot benefit from "doing damage more slowly" -- only from actually helping.  If cutting emissions, even to zero, is insufficient to allow the lake to naturally purge the waste, then they will still be on the hook for cleanup.  This is similar to the US "Superfund" system, and follows the widely accepted "polluter pays" principle.}}

=== 7. Gain around driving positive feedback loops===

A [[positive feedback]] loop speeds up a process. Meadows indicates that in most cases, it is preferable to slow down a positive loop, rather than speeding up a negative one.

{{quote|The [[eutrophication]] of a lake is a typical feedback loop that goes wild. In a eutrophic lake (which means well-nourished), lots of life can be supported (fish included).

An increase of [[nutrient]]s will lead to an increase of productivity, growth of [[phytoplankton]] first, using up as much nutrients as possible, followed by growth of [[zooplankton]], feeding up on the first ones, and increase of fish populations. The more available nutrients there are, the more productivity is increased. As plankton organisms die, they fall to the bottom of the lake, where their matter is degraded by decomposers.

However, this degradation uses up available [[oxygen]], and in the presence of huge amounts of organic matter to degrade, the medium progressively becomes [[hypoxia (environmental)|anoxic]] (there is no more oxygen available). In time, all oxygen-dependent life dies, and the lake becomes a smelly anoxic place where no life can be supported (in particular no fish).}}

=== 6. Structure of information flow (who does and does not have access to what kinds of information)===

[[Information flow (disambiguation)|Information flow]] is neither a parameter, nor a reinforcing or slowing loop, but a loop that delivers new information. It is cheaper and easier to change information flows than it is to change structure.

:For example, a monthly public report of water pollution level, especially nearby the industrial release, could have a lot of effect on people's opinions regarding the industry, and lead to changes in the waste water level of pollution.

=== 5. Rules of the system (such as incentives, punishment, constraints)===

Pay attention to rules, and to who makes them.

{{quote|For example, a strengthening of the law related to chemicals release limits, or an increase of the tax amount for any water containing a given pollutant, will have a very strong effect on the lake water quality.}}

=== 4. Power to add, change, evolve, or self-organize system structure===

[[Self-organization]] describes a system's ability to change itself by creating new structures, adding new negative and positive feedback loops, promoting new information flows, or making new rules.

{{quote|For example, microorganisms have the ability to not only change to fit their new polluted environment, but also to undergo an evolution that makes them able to biodegrade or bioaccumulate chemical pollutants. This capacity of part of the system to participate in its own [[eco-evolution]] is a major leverage for change.}}

=== 3. Goal of the system ===
Changing goals changes every item listed above: parameters, feedback loops, information and self-organization.

{{quote|A city council decision might be to change the goal of the lake from making it a free facility for public and private use, to a more [[ecotourism|tourist]] oriented facility or a [[Conservation ethic|conservation]] area. That goal change will effect several of the above leverage points: information on water quality will become mandatory and legal punishment will be set for any illegal effluent.}}

=== 2. Mindset or paradigm that the system &amp;mdash; its goals, structure, rules, delays, parameters &amp;mdash; arises from ===

A societal paradigm is an idea, a shared unstated assumption, or a system of thought that is the foundation of complex social structures. Paradigms are very hard to change, but there are no limits to paradigm change. Meadows indicates paradigms might be changed by repeatedly and consistently pointing out anomalies and failures in the current paradigm to those with open minds.

:''A current paradigm is "Nature is a stock of resources to be converted to human purpose". What might happen to the lake were this collective idea changed ?''

=== 1. Power to transcend paradigms===

Transcending paradigms may go beyond challenging fundamental assumptions, into the realm of changing the values and priorities that lead to the assumptions, and being able to choose among value sets at will.

{{quote|Many today see Nature as a stock of resources to be converted to human purpose.  Many Native Americans see Nature as a living god, to be loved, worshipped, and lived with.  These views are incompatible, but perhaps another viewpoint could incorporate them both, along with others.}}
