The '''2007 Yemen tourist attack''' was a suicide car bomb attack on [[Spain|Spanish]] tourists visiting the [[Queen of Sheba]] temple in [[Mareb]], [[Ma'rib Governorate]] on July 2, 2007.

==Details==
A member of [[Al-Qaeda]] rammed an explosive-laden car into a tourist convoy killing 8 Spanish tourists, 2 Yemeni Drivers, and injuring 12.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/middle_east/6936999.stm|title=Yemeni tourist bombers ‘killed’|publisher=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
On August 8, four [[Islamic militants|militants]] died in a Yemeni security forces raid near Mareb, one of them [[Kassem al-Raimi]], who was the top al-Qaeda operative who masterminded the attacks. Raimi was involved in other operations and was one of 13 convicted prisoners who escaped from a [[Sana'a|Sanaa]] prison in 2006.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10919">[[Image:Absolut vodka.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Absolut Vodka]], the most successful product of the privatised manufacturer [[Vin&amp;Sprit]].]]

'''Alcoholic drinks in Sweden''' are as common as in most of the [[western world]]. Sweden is historically part of the [[Alcohol belts of Europe#Vodka belt|vodka belt]], with high consumption of [[distilled drinks]] and [[binge drinking]], but during the later half of the 20th century, habits are more harmonized with western Europe, with increasing popularity of wine and weekday drinking. [[Swedish wine|Wine]] is now also grown and produced in several parts of Sweden and the southernmost region of [[Skåne]] is turning into a hub experiencing a strong growth in number of [[Kullahalvöns vingård|active vineyards]].

==Drinks and brands==
The main Swedish specialty is ''[[brännvin]]'' (literally "burn-wine"), [[liquor]] distilled from [[fermentation (food)|fermented]] grain or potatoes. [[Vodka]] is the highest grade of brännvin, with brands like [[Absolut Vodka]] and [[Explorer Vodka]]. Brännvin seasoned with herbs is known as [[akvavit]]. This is usually drunk as a [[snaps]], also known as ''nubbe'', a small [[shot glass]] to a traditional meal (especially [[pickled herring]] or [[crayfish]]).

[[Lager beer]] is the most popular beer, both with meals and in bars. In restaurants and bars it is usually served as a ''stor stark'' (literally "large strong"), a glass usually containing 40 - 50 cL of ''starköl'' (see below). Lättöl (generally around 2% abv) is very popular in lunch restaurants as for the vast majority of people it is possible to drink one serving of it and still stay below the legal limits for [[drink driving]].

Sweet [[cider]] is also common. As of July 1, 2005, new rules established that only fermented juice from [[apple]] or [[pear]] is allowed to be called 'cider'. Before this change, any fruit-based drink could be called cider, meaning that what would be considered [[alcopop]] in other countries could be sold as cider in Sweden.

==History==
[[File:Alcohol belt.PNG|thumb|Sweden is traditionally part of the [[vodka belt]].]]

Since the Middle Ages, [[beer]] was the staple drink in Sweden. [[Mead]] was a common delicacy. Distilling was introduced in the 15th century. [[Prohibition]] against production and/or sale of [[brännvin]]—distilled alcohol—has been enforced during some periods.

As Sweden was industrialized and urbanized during the 19th century, industrially produced brännvin became more available, and alcohol caused increasing health and social problems. The [[temperance movement]] rose, and since 1905, government has had a monopoly on sales of liquor. The [[Swedish prohibition referendum]] in 1922 resulted in continued sales of alcohol. A rationing system, called ''[[Brattsystemet]]'' or ''[[motbok]]'', was used until 1955. As Sweden entered the [[European Union|EU]] in 1995, drinking habits became more continental, and regulations were relaxed. [[Systembolaget]] introduced [[box wine]] and law allowed private enterprises to produce, import and market alcohol, and sell directly to restaurants—though the retail monopoly remained. Consumption of alcohol increased by 30% from 1995 to 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sweden.gov.se/sb/d/2901 Government Offices of Sweden:''Sweden's alcohol policy''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110102642/http://www.sweden.gov.se/sb/d/2901 |date=January 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulation and taxation==
[[Image:Avlöningsafton - Rösta ja! 1922.jpg|thumb|150px|left|upright|"Payday evening - vote yes!" Poster from [[Swedish prohibition referendum, 1922]].]]
[[Image:Sodertalje5.JPG|thumb|Systembolaget store.]]
Sweden has a [[government alcohol monopoly]] called [[Systembolaget]] for sale of all alcoholic drinks stronger than 3.5% by volume. The minimum purchase age at Systembolaget is 20 years, but 18 at licensed restaurants and bars.

Beer is legally divided into three classes. Class I (maximum 2.25%), called ''lättöl'' ("light beer"), is sold without restrictions (although shops often set their own age restrictions). Class II (up to 3.5%), called ''folköl'' ("people's beer"), is sold in regular stores, but with the minimum purchase age of 18. Class III, ''starköl'' ("strong beer", over 3.5%) is sold only in Systembolaget stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Alkoholstatistik 2006/Alcohol statistics 2006 |year=2008 |author=Statens folkhälsoinstitut |isbn=978-91-7257-537-0 |pages=12–14 |url=http://www.fhi.se/upload/ar2008/rapporter_2008/R200802_Alkoholstatistik06_0802.pdf }}{{dead link|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drinks are taxed by content of alcohol, more heavily than in most other countries. The tax on vodka (40%) is 200.56 SEK/litre, on Wine (14%) 22.08 SEK/litre and on beer (4.5%) 6.615 SEK/litre (2007). Beer with 2.8% alcohol or less is exempt from tax, except VAT.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skatteverket.se/download/18.61589f801118cb2b7b280003975/51011.pdf Swedish Tax Agency: ''Excise duties'']{{dead link|date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The VAT is 12% (food tax) for drinks sold in shops having up to 3.5% alcohol, and 25% above that, and at restaurants.

Systembolaget has a strict monopoly status on alcohol sales to consumers in Sweden, except for restaurant and bars, where alcohol can be sold for immediate consumption (bottles must be opened and can't be brought home).

Other companies (producers and importers) can sell directly to restaurant and bars (EU enforced rule).
Producers of alcohol, such as vineyards, are not allowed to sell bottles of their products to consumers.

The only exceptions to the monopoly to consumers are export shops at airports, which can sell alcohol to people checked in for a flight outside the EU. Alcohol cannot be sold on boats on Swedish waters, but the shop is opened at the border to international or foreign waters.

The import quota from other EU countries is unlimited for personal use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tullverket.se/en/startpage/keywordsaz/az/alcohol/alcoholfromanothereucountry.4.16ca6de0120cf835feb80002020.html Tullverket: Importation of alcohol for personal use when travelling]&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the taxes many Swedes supply themselves in [[Estonia]] or [[Germany]]. Limited rations of [[duty-free shop]]ping is allowed on the [[ferries between Sweden and Finland]], provided they dock at [[Åland]], which is an autonomous part of Finland, and has a [[Special member state territories and their relations with the EU#.C3.85land Islands|special treaty]] with the EU. Ordering alcohol for mail order delivery is permitted, but the Swedish state is able to levy taxes on the recipient of such alcohol.

[[Moonshining]] does occur, mainly in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fhi.se/templates/page____4951.aspx Swedish Institute for Public Health, March 11, 2005] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071109070353/http://www.fhi.se/templates/page____4951.aspx |date=November 9, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Distilling without a commercial production license is illegal in Sweden, even for personal use, and might result in fines or jail time. The mere act of owning parts of a [[still]] is also illegal. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.riksdagen.se/sv/Dokument-Lagar/Lagar/Svenskforfattningssamling/Alkohollag-20101622_sfs-2010-1622/?bet=2010%3A1622#K11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Restaurants and bars==
Alcohol can be sold in restaurants, bars and nightclubs. The age limit is 18, though some nightclubs voluntarily require a minimum age at the door above 18 (usually 20 or 23, occasionally up to 27).&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4Gy5c4htdh4C&amp;pg=PA65&amp;lpg=PA65&amp;dq=legal+drinking+age+sweden+30&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ilr-sgmu47&amp;sig=nooXROcsr_1hGh6pJ7dpG56jexg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjT4pHx9O_JAhUCtRoKHdzXBCI4ChDoAQgoMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=legal%20drinking%20age%20sweden%2030&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; Alcohol may be served only between 11 AM-1 AM. Municipalities can permit a later closure time, sometimes as late as 5 AM.&lt;ref name=tillstandsenheten&gt;[http://foretag.stockholm.se/Tillstand/tillstandsenheten/Lagar-regler-och-riktlinjer/Riktlinjer/ Riktlinjer för serveringstillstånd] (Swedish)&lt;/ref&gt;

Alcohol is only allowed to be sold at bars if they are defined as restaurants, which means they have to offer warm food on location. After 23:00 a simple menu is enough.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haninge.se/Social-omsorg/Tillstand/Alkohol/Forsaljning-av-alkoholdrycker/ Alkohollagens regler vid servering av alkoholdrycker] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221022452/http://www.haninge.se/Social-omsorg/Tillstand/Alkohol/Forsaljning-av-alkoholdrycker/ |date=2013-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Restaurants, bars and pubs need permission from the [[Municipalities of Sweden|municipality]] to sell alcohol. Overly drunk people must not be allowed to enter premises with an alcohol license. People who get noticeably intoxicated while at the premises must not be served more and have to be removed immediately.&lt;br/&gt;
The alcohol must be for immediate consumption, meaning that the staff has to open bottles. Guests are not allowed to bring alcoholic drinks into the restaurant or out from it. This includes if there is an adjacent convenience store, people are not allowed to buy 3.5% beer and drink in the restaurant. If a train or domestic aircraft is licensed to sell alcohol people are not allowed to drink their own alcohol. Outdoor areas in restaurants must be clearly separated from the street.&lt;br/&gt;
Restaurants must claim payment for every single glass and bottle sold. The inclusion of a first drink in the admission fee is prohibited. It is legal to sell large bottles of hard alcohol to groups, but not after 1 a.m.&lt;ref name=tillstandsenheten/&gt;

From the 19th century to 1977 restaurants had to serve warm food when alcohol was sold. Many people bought simple food which they did not eat. It could be as simple as a boiled egg. Regulars who were known not to eat the food were often served food which had already been served to other customers.

==Temperance movement==
The [[temperance movement]] is strong in Sweden,{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} especially in agricultural areas, and often connected with the "[[free church]]es" (non-conformists, that is Protestants outside the [[Church of Sweden]]). The [[Straight Edge]] movement spread among Swedish youth in the 1990s.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

[[Scandinavia]]n [[Lutheran]]s played a large part in supporting [[Prohibition in the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kathleen A.

The '''Amsterdam Dance Event''' ('''ADE''') is a five-day [[electronic music]] conference and festival held annually in mid-October. The event is organized by Rob Jones &lt;ref name=dutch&gt;{{cite news|title=The international Dance industry assembles in Amsterdam next week|url=http://www.dutchdailynews.com/the-international-dance-industry-assembles-in-amsterdam-next-week/|accessdate=January 31, 2013|newspaper=Dutch Daily News|date=October 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and offers a full program of daytime conferences at ADE Pro, ADE Tech, HDE, ADE University, ADE Next, ADE Beamlab and ADE Green, alongside the nighttime ADE Festival which features 450 events and 2,200 artists over five days in 115 clubs and venues. The shows attract over 350,000 people from all over the world to the city, making [[Amsterdam]]&lt;ref name=iam&gt;{{cite web|title=Amsterdam Dance Event highlights |url=http://www.iamsterdam.com/en-GB/experience/what-to-do/whats-on/clubbing_and_nightlife_in_amsterdam/ade-highlights |work=iAmsterdam.com |accessdate=January 31, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121142815/http://www.iamsterdam.com/en-GB/experience/what-to-do/whats-on/clubbing_and_nightlife_in_amsterdam/ade-highlights |archivedate=January 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=two&gt;{{cite web|title=ADE: Amsterdam Dance Event|url=http://www.local-life.com/amsterdam/articles/amsterdam-dance-event|work=Local-Life.com|accessdate=January 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the busiest clubbing cities in the world.

== History ==
Started in 1995 as a three-day conference&lt;ref name=two/&gt; and attended by 300 delegates with thirty DJs performing, the ADE was initially based in [[De Balie]] for the daytime conference and at night featured shows in three venues: Paradiso, Melkweg and Club Escape. The event starts off on Wednesday with ADE Pro, ADE Tech. ADE Green and ADE University,  plus in the evening the DJ Cook-Off, which was won for a third time by [[Seth Troxler]] in 2013. Alongside that, ADE also now includes the awards ceremony of the DJ Mag Top 100 DJs Poll.&lt;ref name=dutch/&gt;&lt;ref name=two/&gt;

== Program ==
The ADE Pro daytime program, which attracted 5,500 music, media and technology industry professionals in 2014, is based around the Felix Meritis centre and the Dylan Hotel, both located on the [[Canals of Amsterdam|Keizersgracht]].  ADE University, is a program for aspiring music industry professionals, with ADE Green (in association with SFX) taking place at the Chicago Social Club. The festival also includes the Hard Dance Event (HDE) in the [[Melkweg]] for harder styles of electronic music.&lt;ref name=two/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HDE@ADE – Q-dance goes global|url=http://www.amsterdam-dance-event.nl/blog/2012/10/hde-ade-q-dance-goes-global/968/|work=Amsterdam-Dance-Event.nl|accessdate=January 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ADE also opens its doors to non-professional musicians with ADE Next, where aspiring artists and producers are invited to meet some of the world’s most popular and in-demand artists, DJs and producers face-to-face in order to get expert opinions on their work.&lt;ref name=two/&gt; The event's latest initiative is ADE Playground, which started in 2011 as a new technology showcase, but since 2012 features around 30 pop-up events, surprise daytime appearances by top DJs, special product lines, film screenings, and discounts in shops and bars.&lt;ref name=dutch/&gt; In 2012 it was also announced that ADE would officially go from a four-day event to five days due to the rapidly growing number of 'afters' events on Sunday.

The nighttime line-up features over 2200 DJs and artists as well as a selection of upcoming local and international talent, playing to a total of more than 350,000 clubbers in venues all over the city.&lt;ref name=iam/&gt; According to the ''Dutch Daily News'', artists who have appeared at ADE in the past include "[[Chuckie (DJ)|Chuckie]] (NL), [[Armin van Buuren]] (NL), [[David Guetta]] (FR), [[Hardwell]] (NL), [[Laidback Luke]] (NL), [[Fedde le Grand|Fedde Le Grand]] (NL), [[Fatboy Slim]] (GB), [[Jay Lumen]] (HU), [[Richie Hawtin]] (CA), [[Afrojack]] (NL), [[Paul van Dyk]] (DE), [[Junkie XL]] (NL) and [[Chase &amp; Status]] (GB)".&lt;ref name=dutch/&gt;

The '''Arts District''' is an area containing many of [[Oklahoma City]]'s best attractions and venues. Many of the buildings in the district are known for urban art deco architecture and charm.

Located at the near western portion of downtown OKC just outside the [[skyscrapers]] of the Central Business District, the Arts District includes World Class attractions such as the [[Myriad Botanical Gardens|Myriad Gardens]], the [[Civic Center Music Hall]], [[Stage Centre for the Performing Arts]], the [[Ronald J. Norick Downtown Library]], the [[Oklahoma City Municipal Building]], the [[Oklahoma City Museum of Art]], and the [[Oklahoma City National Memorial]].

The district is currently experiencing a building boom (along with the rest of downtown), as announcements for new housing and retail projects frequent the Oklahoma City media circles.

Due west of the Arts District is the [[Film Exchange District]] and [[Westown Oklahoma City|WesTown]], soon to experience a boom of their own as the renaissance of downtown [[Oklahoma City]] continues to move west.

'''''Babaylan''''' (also '''''balian''''' or '''''katalonan''''', among many other names), were [[animism|animistic]] [[shaman]]s of the various [[ethnic groups of the Philippines|ethnic groups]] of the [[History of the Philippines (900–1521)|pre-colonial]] [[Philippines|Philippine islands]]. These shamans were almost always women or [[Bakla|feminized men]] (''asog'' or ''bayok''). They were believed to have [[spirit guide]]s, by which they could contact and interact with the spirits (''[[anito]]'') and the [[Spirit world (Spiritualism)|spirit world]]. Their primary role were as [[mediumship|mediums]] during ''pag-anito'' [[séance]] rituals. There were also various subtypes of ''babaylan'' specializing in the arts of [[Traditional medicine|healing]] and [[herbalism]], [[divination]], and [[Witchcraft|sorcery]].&lt;ref name="scott1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[William Henry Scott (historian)|William Henry Scott]]|title =Looking For The Prehispanic Filipino and Other Essays in Philippine History|publisher =New Day Publishers|year =1992|pages=124&amp;ndash;127|isbn =9711005247|url =https://archive.org/stream/LookingForThePrehispanicFilipino/Looking%20for%20the%20Prehispanic%20Filipino#page/n67/mode/2up/search/babaylan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
''Babaylan'' and related terms are derived from [[Western Malayo-Polynesian languages|Proto-Western-Malayo-Polynesian]] ''*balian'', meaning "shaman" (probably originally female, [[transvestite]], or hermaphroditic) or "[[mediumship|medium]]". Various [[cognate]]s in other non-Filipino [[Austronesian languages]] include ''babalian'', ''bobolian'', and ''bo-bohizan'' ([[Kadazan-Dusun]]); ''wadian'' ([[Ma'anyan language|Ma'anyan]]); ''belian'',  ([[Iban language|Iban]]); ''belian'' ([[Malay language|Malay]]); ''walen'' or ''walyan'' ([[Old Javanese]]); ''balian'' ([[Balinese language|Balinese]]); ''bolian'' ([[Mongondow language|Mongondaw]]); ''balia'' ([[Uma language|Uma]]); ''wulia'' or ''balia'' ([[Bare'e language|Bare'e]]); ''balia'' ([[Wolio language|Wolio]]); ''balian'' ([[Ngaju people|Ngaju]]); and ''balieng'' ([[Makassarese language|Makassar]]).&lt;ref name="balian"&gt;{{cite web |author=Robert Blust &amp; Stephen Trussel|title=Austronesian Comparative Dictionary: *ba |url=http://www.trussel2.com/acd/acd-s_b.htm#ba |website=Austronesian Comparative Dictionary |accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="shafii"&gt;{{cite journal|author=A.S. Hardy Shafii, Solehah Ishak, Hazman Hassan, Mohamed Ghouse Nasuruddin, &amp; Mumtaz Begum|year=2016|title=''Babalian'' and community rituals of Dusun Tatana Ethnic in Sabah, Malaysia: A Preliminary Study|journal=The European Proceedings of Social &amp; Behavioural Sciences|pages=104&amp;ndash;112|doi=10.15405/epsbs.2016.08.16|url=https://www.futureacademy.org.uk/files/images/upload/ISSC%202016%2015.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The linguist [[Otto Dempwolff]] has theorized that it may ultimately be derived from [[Proto-Austronesian language|Proto-Austronesian]] ''*bali'' ("escort", "accompany") with the suffix ''*-an'', in the meaning of "one who escorts a soul to the other world (a [[psychopomp]])".&lt;ref name="demp"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Otto Dempwolff|year=1934–1938 |title=Vergleichende Lautlehre des austronesischen Wortschatzes|journal=Zeitschrift für Eingeborenen-Sprachen|issue=Special Publications nos. 15, 17, 19}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the linguists [[Robert Blust]] and [[Stephen Trussel]] have noted that there is no evidence that ''*balian'' is a suffixed form, and thus believe that Dempwolff's interpretation is incorrect.&lt;ref name="balian"/&gt;

==Terminology==
The most common term for shamans in the Philippines are ''baylan'', ''balian'', or cognates and spelling variants thereof.&lt;ref name="mccoy"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Alfred McCoy|year=1982|title=Baylan : Animist Religion and Philippine Peasant Ideology|journal=Philippine Quarterly of Culture and Society|volume=10|issue=3|pages=141&amp;ndash;194|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/310606975_Baylan_Animist_Religion_and_Philippine_Peasant_Ideology}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, different ethnic groups had different names for shamans, including shamans with specialized roles.

==Initiation==

Most ''babaylan'' inherited their status from an older ''babaylan'' they were voluntarily apprenticed to, usually a relative.&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt; In some cultures, like among the [[Isneg people]], older shamans can choose apprentices from among the eligible young women of the village.&lt;ref name="demetrio73"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aswangguide"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aswangproject.com/filipino-shaman/|title=6 Guidelines for Becoming a Filipino Shaman|author=Daniel De Guzman|publisher=The Aswang Project|accessdate=6 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few, however, become ''babaylan'' after experiencing what has been termed a "shamanistic initiatory crisis" (also "shamanic illness" or "shamanic madness").&lt;ref name="demetrio73"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mccoy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="turner"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Robert P. Turner, David Lukoff, Ruth Tiffany Barnhouse, &amp; Francis G. Lu |year=1995|title=Religious or spiritual problem. A culturally sensitive diagnostic category in the DSM-IV|journal=Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease|volume=183|issue=7|pages=435–444|pmid=7623015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes serious or chronic illnesses, [[near-death experience]]s, sudden [[epilepsy|seizures]] and trembling, [[Depression (mood)|depression]], strange events or behavior (including climbing [[balete tree|''balete'' trees]] or disappearing for several days with no memory of the events), bouts of insanity (including those induced by [[psychological trauma]] from a past event), and strange visions or dreams. These are regarded as encounters with the spirits, where the soul of the person is said to be journeying to the spirit world. In cases like this, it is said that a [[anito|spirit]] chose the person, rather than the other way around.&lt;ref name="Scott1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Henry Scott  | authorlink = William Henry Scott (historian)   | url = https://archive.org/details/BarangaySixteenthCenturyPhilippineCultureAndSociety | title = Barangay: Sixteenth Century Philippine Culture and Society  | publisher = Ateneo de Manila University Press  | date = 1994 | isbn = 9715501354 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mayuga"/&gt;&lt;ref name="demetrio73"/&gt;

After being chosen, shamans go through an initiation rite. These rites are meant to gain or transfer the patronage of a spirit. Among Visayans, this ritual is known as the ''tupad'' or ''tupadan''. In cases of people with "shamanic illness", these initiation rites are regarded as the cure, where the initiate regains health or sanity by conceding to the wishes of the spirits and "answering the call". When volunteered rather than volunteering, their relatives are usually required to pay a large fee to the senior shaman for the training. Initiation rites can range from simply inducing a [[trance]] through herbs or alcohol, to inducing personal crises through physical or psychological hardship.&lt;ref name="demetrio73"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jocano1958"/&gt; Extreme examples of initiation rites include getting buried alive or being immersed in water overnight.&lt;ref name="mayuga"/&gt;

After initiation, the apprentices are then trained in the details of their role. This training includes learning about the rituals, the chants and songs, the sacrifices appropriate for each spirit, oral histories, herbs and healing practices, and magic spells, among others. They usually assist the senior shaman during ceremonies until their training is complete, which can take months to years. Each shaman can have one or more such apprentices, at varying ranks or specializations.&lt;ref name="demetrio73"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jocano1958"&gt;{{cite journal|author=J. Landa Jocano|year=1958|title=The Sulod: A Mountain People in Central Panay|journal=Philippine Studies|volume=6|issue=4|pages=401&amp;ndash;436|url=http://www.philippinestudies.net/files/journals/1/articles/7395/public/7395-7583-1-PB.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spirit guides===
The shaman's power to communicate with the [[Spirit world (spiritualism)|spirit world]] is derived from their [[spirit guide|spirit companions]] that guide them and intercede for them. These spirits are usually referred to in euphemistic terms like ''abyan'' ("friend"), ''alagad'' or ''bantay'' ("guardian"), or ''gabay'' ("guide"), among other terms. Shamans have at least one ''abyan'', with more powerful shamans having many. Certain individuals like powerful leaders or warriors (especially those with shaman relatives) are also believed to have their own ''abyan'' that give them magical powers. ''Abyan'' are also believed to guide, teach, and inspire skilled artists and craftsmen in the community.&lt;ref name="mccoy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jocano1958"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mora2005"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Manolete Mora|year=2005|title=Mind, Body, Spirit, and Soul: A Filipino Epistemology of Adeptness in Musical Performance |journal=Asian Music|volume=36|issue=2|pages=81&amp;ndash;95|jstor=4098517 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="buenconsejo2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=José S.

''Abyan'' spirits can be [[Anito#Ancestor spirits|ancestor spirits]], but they are more commonly [[Diwata|non-human spirits]]. Shamans either had spirit companions from birth, drew their attention during the "shamanic illness", or gained their allegiance during initiation into shamanism. Spirits are believed to be social beings, with individual quirks and personalities (both good and bad). The friendship of ''abyan'' depend on [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]]. The shamans do not command them. People with ''abyan'' must regularly offer sacrifices to these spirits, usually consisting of food, alcoholic drinks, ''[[Paan#Philippines|ngangà]]'', and blood from a sacrificial animal (usually a chicken or a pig)&lt;ref group="note"&gt;These sacrifices vary depending on the type of spirit being interacted with (Buenconsejo, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; in order to maintain good relations. This friendship of ''abyan'', once earned, is enduring. They become, in essence, part of the family. The ''abyan'' of a deceased shaman will often "return" to a living relative who might choose to become a shaman as well.&lt;ref name="mora2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="buenconsejo2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="madarang"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/20583-in-the-presence-of-a-babaylan|title=In the presence of a Babaylan|author=Rhea Claire E.

The ''abyan'' are essential in shamanistic rituals as they prevent the shaman's soul from getting lost in the spirit world. They also communicate entreaties on behalf of the shaman to more powerful spirits or deities, as well as fight evil spirits during healing or exorcism rituals.&lt;ref name="aguilar98"&gt;{{cite book|author=Filomeno V.

===Sex and gender===

In most Philippine ethnic groups, shamans were predominantly female due to the role of the shaman (especially the medium) being an intrinsically feminine one.&lt;ref name="brewer99"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Carolyn Brewer|year=1999|title=''Baylan'', ''Asog'', Transvestism, and Sodomy: Gender, Sexuality and the Sacred in Early Colonial Philippines |journal=Intersections: Gender, History and Culture in the Asian Context|issue=2|pages=1|url=http://intersections.anu.edu.au/issue2/carolyn2.html#t50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the minority of males, most belonged to a special class of shamans - the feminized men known as ''asog'' in the Visayas and ''bayok'' in Luzon.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;''Asog'' is from Proto-Western-Malayo-Polynesian ''*asug'', "shaman in ritual transvestite attire"; and [[Central Philippine languages|Proto-Central Philippine]] ''*ásug'', "sterile" or "asexual". ''Asog'' is the term used for transvestite male shamans in most of the Visayas and in the [[Bicol Region]]. Other Visayan terms include ''bantot'', ''bayog'', ''binabaye'', and ''babayenon''. In the rest of Luzon, they are known as ''bayok'' (''bayoc''), ''bayog'', ''bayogin'' (''bayoguin'' or ''bayoquin''), ''binabae'', or ''bido''. Notably among the [[Sambal people|Sambal]], the highest-ranking shaman was a ''bayok''. They are also known as ''labia'' among the [[Subanen people|Subanen]], though they were not necessarily shamans (Garcia, 2008; Kroeber, 1918). In modern Filipino languages, the most commonly used terms are ''bakla'', ''bayot'', or ''agi''. See also ''[[Bakla]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The ''asog'' assumed the voice, mannerisms, hairstyle, and dress of females. They were treated as women by the community and worked in traditionally feminine professions like shamanism, pottery, and weaving.&lt;ref name="cole"/&gt;&lt;ref name="demetrio73"/&gt;&lt;ref name="brewer99"/&gt;&lt;ref name="garcia2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lim2015"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bliss Cua Lim|year=2015|title=Queer Aswang Transmedia: Folklore as Camp|journal=Kritika Kultura|volume=24|pages=178&amp;ndash;225|url=https://escholarship.org/content/qt3mj1k076/qt3mj1k076.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="*asug"&gt;{{cite web |author=Robert Blust &amp; Stephen Trussel|title=Austronesian Comparative Dictionary: *a |url=http://www.trussel2.com/acd/acd-s_a1.htm#316 |website=Austronesian Comparative Dictionary |accessdate=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="francia2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Luis H.

In ''Historia de las islas e indios de Bisayas'' (1668), the Spanish historian and missionary [[Francisco Ignacio Alcina]] records that the ''asog'' became shamans by virtue of being themselves. Unlike female shamans, they neither needed to be chosen nor did they undergo initiation rites. However, not all ''asog'' trained to become shamans.&lt;ref name="garcia2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kroeber"/&gt;

Nevertheless, male shamans remained rare. The ''Bolinao Manuscript'' (1685), for example, records that during an [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisitional]] investigation of the shamans in the town of [[Bolinao, Pangasinan|Bolinao]] between 1679 and 1685, animistic paraphernalia were confiscated from 148 people. Of those, 145 were female shamans, and the remaining three were transvestite male shamans.&lt;ref name="brewer99"/&gt;

''Babaylan'' can freely marry and have children,&lt;ref name="liturgy"/&gt; including male ''asog'' who were recorded by early Spanish colonists as being married to men.&lt;ref name="garcia2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=J.

In general, there was a great degree of sexual freedom in precolonial Filipino societies. Virginity was not valued, adultery was not perceived negatively, and there was wide use of [[genital piercing]]s (''tugbuk'' and ''sakra''). (Brewer, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; In some ethnic groups, marriage was a prerequisite for gaining full shaman status.&lt;ref name="brewer99"/&gt;

After the Spanish conquest of the Philippines, the practice of shamanism became clandestine due to persecution by the Catholic clergy. During this period, male shamans (particularly those specialized in the non-religious arts of herbalism and healing) became predominant. Female shamans became less common, while ''asog'' (shaman or otherwise) were punished harshly and driven to hiding.&lt;ref name="gin2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Filomeno V.

Male shamans in the late 17th century still dressed as women during rituals, even though they didn't do so in their day-to-day activities. Unlike the ancient ''asog'', they did not have sexual relations with other men, and indeed, were usually married to women.&lt;ref name="brewer99"/&gt;

== Roles ==
===Spirit mediums===
[[File:Ato the Fertility God of the Bontoc Tribe.jpg|thumb|Ato, a [[anito|fertility god]] of the [[Bontoc people]]]]
The primary role of shamans were as [[Mediumship|spirit mediums]].&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt; They were intermediaries between the physical world and the [[Spirit world (spiritualism)|spirit world]], due to their ability to [[Evocation|influence and interact]] with the [[anito|spirits]] (''[[anito]]''), both malevolent and benevolent.&lt;ref name="francia2013"/&gt;

There are two general types of spirits usually interacted with in [[séance]] rituals. The first are the environmental or nature spirits "bound" to a particular location or natural phenomenon (similar to [[genii loci]]). They "own" places and concepts like agricultural fields, forests, cliffs, seas, winds, lightning, or realms in the spirit world. Some were also "keepers" or [[totem]]s of various animals and plants. They have inhuman and abstract qualities, reflecting their particular dominions. They do not normally appear in human form and are usually gender-less or androgynous. They rarely concern themselves with human affairs. Rituals involving these spirits are almost always conducted outdoors.&lt;ref name="buenconsejo2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="novellino"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dario Novellino|editor =David G. Anderson &amp; Eeva Berglund|title =   Ethnographies of Conservation: Environmentalism and the Distribution of Privilege|chapter =Contrasting Landscapes, Conflicting Ontologies: Assessing Environmental Conservation on Palawan Island (The Philippines)|publisher =Berghahn Books|year =2003|pages=171&amp;ndash;188|isbn =9780857456748|url =https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=R1WwBWFEljQC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second type of spirits are the "unbound" spirits which have independent existence. They appear in animal (usually as birds) or human-like forms,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Spirits in human form are believed to be distinguishable from humans because they do not have a [[philtrum]]. (Buenconsejo, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; have gender differentiation, and have personal names.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Names of spirits are generally not spoken aloud outside of a shamanic ritual, as it is believed that it may provoke them. They are instead referred to in euphemistic terms like ''"dili ingon nato"'' or ''"hindi kagaya natin"'', literally meaning "those unlike us". (Buenconsejo, 2002; Tan, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; They are most similar to the [[fairies]] of European folklore.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;With strong parallels to human-like beings like [[Elf|elves]] and ''[[aos sí]]'', as well as diminutive human-like beings like [[Brownie (folklore)|brownies]] and [[pixie]]s. (Buenconsejo, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; These are the most common types of spirits to become ''abyan'', as they are the most "sociable" and can take interest in human activities. These spirits are usually referred to as ''engkanto'' (from Spanish ''encanto'') in modern Filipino folklore. Unlike the "bound" spirits, these spirits can be invited into human households, and their rituals can take place both outdoors and indoors.&lt;ref name="buenconsejo2002"/&gt;

These categories are not static, however. A bound spirit can become unbound, and vice versa. Some shamans have spirit guides which are originally nature spirits that have become unbound.&lt;ref name="buenconsejo2002"/&gt;

Not all shamanic rituals result in [[spirit possession]]. Unbound spirits always possess shamans during rituals. Either voluntarily or involuntarily. In contrast, bound spirits, as a rule, do not possess shamans. Instead, they are simply spoken to by the shaman. Bound spirits that inadvertently "stick" to humans are considered dangerous, and are the causes of spiritual illnesses, ranging from confusion, strange food cravings, lust, to unreasoning anger. Sometimes in order to speak to certain bound spirits, the shaman may need the intercession of their ''abyan'', who in turn will possess the shaman. Bound spirits can also be interacted with by non-shamans, like when offering sacrifices to the spirit of the forest before a hunt.&lt;ref name="buenconsejo2002"/&gt;

===Healing===
{{See also|Mananambal|Soul dualism}}
Healing was the most important role for shamans in their communities. Shamans distinguished between two kinds of illnesses, the natural (or non-spiritual) illnesses, and the spiritual illnesses. Natural illnesses do not require a shaman for healing, while spiritual illnesses do.&lt;ref name="salazar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gaabucayan71"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Samuel Gaabucayan |year=1971|title=The Medicine Men of Agusan in Mindanao, Philippines|journal=Asian Folklore Studies|volume=30|issue=1|pages=39&amp;ndash;54|doi= 10.2307/1177763 |url= https://www.jstor.org/stable/1177763 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like in other [[Austronesians|Austronesian]] cultures, animistic Filipinos believed in the concept of [[soul dualism]] (sometimes referred to as "twin souls" or "double souls"). A person is believed to be composed of at least two souls - the breath of life (''ginhawa'' or ''hininga'', which stays with the living body) and the [[Astral body|astral soul]] (the ''kalag'' or ''kaluluwa'', which can travel to the spirit world).&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Other names for the astral soul include ''kaluha'', ''dungan'' (Visayan); ''kalag'' ([[Bicolano people|Bicol]]); ''linnawa'' ([[Igorot people|Igorot]]), ''kaduwa'' ([[Isneg people|Isneg]]), ''ab-abiik'' ([[Kankanaey people|Kankanaey]]), ''karurua'' ([[Ilocano people|Ilocano]]), ''ikaruruwa'' ([[Ibanag people|Ibanag]]), ''karaduwa'' ([[Mangyan people|Mangyan]]), ''kiyaraluwa'' ([[Tagbanwa people|Tagbanwa]]), ''makatu'' ([[Bukidnon people|Bukidnon]]), and ''kadengan-dengan'' or ''gimokud'' ([[Manobo people|Manobo]]). (Scott, 1994; Tan, 2008; Mercado, 1991) Most of the terms for the astral soul literally translate to "twin" or "double", from PAN *duSa, "two". (Yu, 2000; Blust, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; The ''ginhawa'' is believed to reside in the pit of the stomach (usually the [[liver]]), while the ''kalag'' resides in the head. The ''ginhawa'' represents the person's body and bodily urges; while the ''kalag'' represents the person's identity, mind, and strength of will. Both are required in a living person.&lt;ref name="yu2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jose Vidamor B. Yu|title =Inculturation of Filipino-Chinese Culture Mentality|volume=Volume 3|publisher =Editrice Pontifica Universita Gregoriana|series =Interreligious and Intercultural Investigations|year =2000|pages=148, 149|isbn =9788876528484|url =https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=c4WqAOKb5c8C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="duSa"&gt;{{cite web |author=Robert Blust &amp; Stephen Trussel|title=Austronesian Comparative Dictionary: *du |url=http://www.trussel2.com/acd/acd-s_d.htm#30339 |website=Austronesian Comparative Dictionary |accessdate=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="salazar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pacete"/&gt;

Natural illnesses are the result of damage to the ''ginhawa''. While they do not require a shaman, they are still important, as the death of the ''ginhawa'' will also mean the death of the body. They can range from wounds, broken bones, poisoning, and snakebites. These can be treated by skilled shamans, but were more often relegated to apprentices or assistants specializing in healing or herbalism.&lt;ref name="yu2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="salazar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pacete"/&gt; 

Spiritual illnesses, on the other hand, are believed to be caused by the separation of the ''kalag'' from the ''ginhawa'' (referred to as "soul loss" in [[anthropological]] literature). This separation happens normally during sleep, where the ''kalag'' detaches to travel through the spirit world, resulting in dreams. However, when this separation happens when the person is awake, it results in spiritual illnesses. The causes of the separation can include the ''kalag'' getting lost in the spirit world; the ''kalag'' being captured, attacked, or seduced by another spirit; or simply the refusal of the ''kalag'' to return to the ''ginhawa''. While it is not immediately lethal, the loss of the ''kalag'' can result in the loss of the person's mind and identity - thus insanity. Spiritual illnesses also include delirium, depression, trauma, fainting spells, and other mental illnesses. Evil or undesirable behavior may also be blamed on disharmony between the ''kalag'' and the ''ginhawa''.&lt;ref name="yu2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mercado1991"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Leonardo N. Mercado|year=1991|title=Soul and Spirit in Filipino Thought |journal=Philippine Studies|volume=39|issue=3|pages=287&amp;ndash;302|jstor=42633258 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yu2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="salazar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pacete"/&gt;

Shamans may also perform rituals to heal and strengthen the ''kalag'' of a person. These include the ritual of ''batak dungan'' or ''batakan'' among Visayan shamans. It strengthens and empowers the ''kalag'' of a person to prepare them for challenges, problems and obstacles. This ritual also protects the person from possible spiritual attack caused by malevolent spirits and sorcery.&lt;ref name="pacete"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sunstar.com.ph/article/131606|title=Pacete: Exploring the spirit world in us|author=Ver F.

====Traditional massage====
{{Expand section|date=December 2018}}
{{Main|Hilot}}
Aside from rituals and herbal medicine, an ubiquitous traditional healing method done by shamans and healers is massage with oils (''lana'') known as ''[[hilot]]'' or ''haplos''.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Also ''aplos'' (Bontoc); ''aptus'' (Ivatan); ''unar'' (Kalinga); ''kemkem'' (Pangasinan); ''ilot'' or ''ilut'' (Ilocano, Itawis, Zambal, &amp; Pampango); ''ablon'' (northern Ilocano); ''ilu'' (Ibanag); ''ilat'' (Isneg); ''elot'' (Ilonggo); ''agod'' or ''agud'' (Maranao &amp; Maguindanao); and ''hagud'' (Lumad)&lt;/ref&gt; It is still commonly practiced to this day.&lt;ref name="apostol"/&gt;&lt;ref name="berdon2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Labastida"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Labastida |first1=Sean Clark Luinor Antallan |last2=Alapay |first2=Johnpolven |last3=Billones |first3=Jenny |last4=Gonzales |first4=Jackquilyn |last5=Macuja |first5=Yra |last6=Manlapig |first6=Ena Eloisa |last7=Montevirgen |first7=Maurice Joy |last8=Pineda |first8=Karla Joyce |last9=Tirol |first9=Fritzie Andrea |title=Tradisyunal nga Pamulong: A Rationale on the Persistence of Faith Healing Practices in Miagao, Iloilo |date=29 April 2016 |publisher=University of the Philippines Visayas |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303899461_TRADISYUNAL_NGA_PAMULONG_A_Rationale_on_the_Persistence_of_Faith_Healing_Practices_in_Miagao_Iloilo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Divination===
[[File:The rotation of Visayan Philippine bakunawa.png|thumb|The rotation of the ''[[bakunawa]]'' in a calendar year, as explained in Mansueto Porras' ''Signosan'' (1919)]]
[[Divination]] was closely tied to healing, as it was primarily used for diagnosing illnesses. It can be done by the shamans or by specialized apprentices with the necessary skill. Various paraphernalia and rituals are used to diagnose illnesses, examples include seashells, ginger, [[quartz]] or [[alum]] [[crystal]]s (''tawas''), and chicken entrails. Diviners have names that indicate their preferred methods. For example, a diviner using alum crystals is known as a ''magtatawas'', while a diviner that prefers to conduct a ritual known as ''luop'' is known as a ''mangluluop''.&lt;ref name="Labastida"/&gt;

Diviners are also able to foretell the future and perform [[geomancy]] rituals. A key mythological creature used in ''babaylan'' geomancy in the Visayas is the ''[[bakunawa]]'' (or ''naga''), usually depicted as a gigantic serpent or dragon with a looped tail. The movements of the ''bakunawa'' affected the physical world, from the phases of the moon, to eclipses, the weather, floods, and earthquakes. The ''bakunawa'' was central to a sixteen-point [[compass rose]]. It faces a different [[cardinal direction]] every three months; facing north (''aminhan''), west (''katungdan''), south (''bagatnan''), and east (''sidlangan'') in a given twelve-month [[Lunar calendar|lunar year]]. The mouth of the ''bakunawa'' is believed to bring misfortune and evil, and various points in the compass all had different aspects depending on where the mouth was facing. These were consulted when making future plans like travel, trade, or marriage. When building houses, shamans were also often consulted to determine the most propitious placement of the foundations to avoid the ill luck brought by the ''bakunawa''.&lt;ref name="mccoy"/&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Similar beliefs exist throughout [[Southeast Asia]]. These include the [[Cambodia]]n ''nak'', [[Burma|Burmese]] ''naga'', and [[Thailand|Thai]] ''naag''. Though the cycles do not correspond exactly, all of them were used as a sort of geomantic calendar.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sorcery===
{{Main|Barang (magic)}}
Some shamans were believed to be able to control the physical world through [[incantation]]s, [[talisman]]s, [[potion]]s, or their spirit intermediaries.&lt;ref name="buenconsejo2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="starr"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Frederick Starr]]|title =Some Filipino Beliefs|publisher =W. Glaisher, Ltd.|year =1930}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;There are various names for sorcerers in Philippine ethnic groups, different from the term for "shaman". Most of these names have negative connotations, and thus is also translated to "[[witch]]" or "[[hag]]" in English sources. They include [[Bicolano people|Bikol]]: ''parakaraw''; [[Ilocano people|Ilocano]]: ''managtanem'', ''managinulod'', ''mannamay''; [[Ivatan people|Ivatan]]:  ''mamkaw'', ''manulib''; [[Kapampangan people|Kapampangan]]: ''mangkukusim'' (or ''mangkukusino''); [[Pangasinan people|Pangasinan]]: ''manananem'', ''mangngibawanen''; [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]]: ''mangkukulam'' (or ''mancocolam''), ''mangagaway'', ''may-galing'', ''hukluban'' (or ''hukloban''); [[Visayans|Visayan]]:  ''dalagangan'', ''dunganon'', ''dalongdongan'', ''busalian'', ''mamamarang'' (or ''mamalarang'', ''barangan''), ''usikan'' (or ''osikan''), ''paktolan'', ''sigbinan'', ''manughiwit'', ''mamumuyag'', ''mang-aawog'' (or ''mang-aawug'', ''mang-aaug'').&lt;/ref&gt; Healers are more strongly associated with sorcerers than mediums. In most cases, a healer is also a sorcerer. In order to cure or counteract sorcerous illnesses, healers must themselves know sorcery.&lt;ref name="gaabucayan71"/&gt; This relationship is most apparent in [[Siquijor Island]], where healer-sorcerers are still common.&lt;ref name="mcclenon"&gt;{{cite journal|author=James McClenon|year=1985|title=Island of Sorcerers|journal=[[Fate (magazine)|Fate]]|volume=38|issue=9|pages=37&amp;ndash;41|url=http://www.mysiquijor.com/IslandoftheSorcerers.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="haas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/oct/30/world/la-fg-philippines-witches-20111031|title=Witches in Philippines' Siquijor province are old hat|author=Benjamin Haas|date=30 October 2011|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tomada"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.philstar.com/cebu-lifestyle/2010/10/03/617239/mystical-siquijor|title=Mystical Siquijor|author=Nathalie M. Tomada|date=3 October 2010|publisher=PhilStar Global|accessdate=15 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cultures like the [[Manobo people]], shamans are entirely differentiated from sorcerers. Shamans deal with the spirit world and supernatural beings but do not have magical powers of their own; while sorcerers were regarded as human beings with powers gained from magical spells or objects. Illnesses believed to be caused by sorcery are treated differently from illnesses caused by spirits. The former are treated with counter-spells, simple antidotes, and physical healing; while the latter requires the intervention or dialogue with the spirits and thus a shaman ritual.&lt;ref name="buenconsejo2002"/&gt;

In contrast, in Visayan societies, the most powerful shamans were sorcerers known as ''dalagangan'' (also ''dalongdongan'' or ''busalian''). They could purportedly command the elements through magic spells and the strength of their ''kalag'' (or ''dungan''). Their alleged powers include conjuring fire or water, flight, shape-shifting, invisibility, invulnerability, and the ability to call down disasters. The ''[[dios-dios]]'' leaders of the Visayan peasant revolts in the late 19th century often claimed to possess these kinds of powers.&lt;ref name="mccoy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="salazar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="feleo"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anita B. Feleo|title =Iloilo: A Rich and Noble Land|publisher =Lopez Group Foundation|year =2007|page=65|isbn =9789719390404}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more common use of the power to command elements is [[Rainmaking (ritual)|rainmaking]]. A notable example was [[Estrella Bangotbanwa]], a [[Karay-a people|Karay-a]] ''ma-aram'' from southern [[Iloilo]]. According to local legend, she alleviated a three-year drought by performing a ritual that summoned a rainstorm.&lt;ref name="stummer2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Stummer|title =The Man In The Fairy Tale Isle (Colored Version): A true story narrated by Laura Montez|publisher =BoD - Books on Demand|year =2017|page=404|isbn =9783744864862|url =https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=7Hg3DwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="davis2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mike Davis|title =Late Victorian Holocausts: El Nino Famines and the Making of the Third World|publisher =Verso Books|year =2002|pages=96&amp;ndash;97|isbn =9781859843826|url =https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=RQsHCBwizFcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Talismans and potions====
{{Expand section|date=November 2018}}

====Black magic====
Sorcerers are also believed to have powers that [[Black magic|cause harm to other people]] covertly. Healer-sorcerers who practice this kind of sorcery usually justify it as a form of criminal punishment, as a widespread belief is that [[black magic]] does not work on people who are innocent. Their targets are usually "wrongdoers" like thieves, adulterous spouses, or [[land grabbing|land grabbers]]. There are also "true" sorcerers who are said to have hereditary sorcerous powers. Unlike healers, they do not consider the justice of their actions. The latter type of sorcerers are often conflated with the evil supernatural beings capable of appearing human, like ''[[aswang]]'' and ''[[manananggal]]''.&lt;ref name="buenconsejo2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mcclenon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tan"/&gt;

One of the most common kinds of black magic is a malevolent use of [[sympathetic magic]]. This is known by various names like ''kulam'', ''gaway'' (Tagalog); ''barang'', ''hiwit'', ''lágà'' (Visayan); ''tanem'', ''tamay'' (Ilocano); and ''pantak'' ([[Moro people|Moro]]). Despite the differences in terminology, the methods are almost identical across the Philippine islands (and indeed, across Southeast Asia). This type of sorcery uses [[beetle]]s, [[effigies]], [[poppet]]s, a boiling pot or some other type of representation of the target victim.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The term ''barang'' refers to a type of beetle in Visayan. ''[[wikt:laga|Lágà]]'' (sometimes written as ''la-ga'' or ''la-aga'') means to brew or to boil [in a pot]. (McClenon, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt; These are usually "linked" by including bodily [[exuviae]] like hair or nail clippings. These are activated by chants, spells, or symbols (sometimes syncretized with Christian or Muslim rituals). The sorcerer then either harms the effigy to cause corresponding harm to the victim, or physically "sends" objects into the victim's body (which can range from insects, stones, to pins).&lt;ref name="mccoy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tan"/&gt; In some instances, the ingredients of the ritual themselves determine the effects. For example, adding seawater to a boiling pot "linked" to a victim is said to cause the victim's belly to swell and ache in time with the [[tide]]s.&lt;ref name="gaabucayan71"/&gt; This type of sorcery was documented as early as the 17th century by [[Francisco Combés]].&lt;ref name="mccoy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tan"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael L. Tan|title =Revisiting Usog, Pasma, Kulam|publisher =University of the Philippines Press|year =2008|isbn =9789715425704|url =https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=EktzHrfup1UC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other malevolent powers are more direct. These include the ability to kill another person instantly with magic spells, the ability to cast [[curse]]s or the [[evil eye]], the ability to "abduct" a person's soul, or the ability to send evil spirits or [[Familiar spirit|familiar animals]] to possess or harm the victim.&lt;ref name="tan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="buenconsejo2002"/&gt;

Some of these purportedly sorcerous powers may be explained by the use of poisons (''hilo'' or ''lason'') and [[sleight of hand]]. In most cases however, accusations of this type of black magic are often borne out of [[paranoia]], [[moral panic]], or [[mass hysteria]] against disliked or mistrusted members of the community, similar to the European [[witch-hunt]]s. People accused of black magic were often subject to ostracization and in many cases, violence. This was especially true during the Spanish colonial period, where in one instance in the mid-19th century, a Filipino [[curate]] ordered the assassination of 57 people he suspected were sorcerers casting evil spells on his sick mother.&lt;ref name="tan"/&gt;

Sorcerous "attacks" are most commonly treated with ''sumbalik'' (counter-spells or antidotes), which are themselves, a form of sorcery and do not usually require interaction with the spirits. They purportedly deflect the effects of the curse and return it to the caster. In extreme cases, ''sumbalik'' can kill the caster. Other healing rituals against sorcery do not harm the caster, but instead supposedly moves them to pity and thus revoke the curse.&lt;ref name="gaabucayan71"/&gt;&lt;ref name="manyfaces"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aswangproject.com/many-faces-filipino-folk-healers/|title=The Many Faces of Filipino Folk Healers|author=Daniel De Guzman|publisher=The Aswang Project|accessdate=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tomada"/&gt;

==Persecution, decline, and syncretization==
The [[History of the Philippines (1521–1898)|Spanish colonization of the Philippines]] and the introduction of Catholic Christianity resulted in the extinction of most native shamanistic practices. Christianity was initially seen by native Filipinos as another type of ''[[anito]]''. The Spanish missionaries exploited this misconception in their successful conversion and occupation of most of the islands with minimal military support. Spanish [[friar]]s were seen as "shamans" whose souls and spirit guides were apparently more powerful than the native ones. They desecrated religious objects, sacred trees, and sacred areas with impunity, earning the awe of the natives. They could also cure various diseases that the native shamans could not.&lt;ref name="aguilar98"/&gt;

By the late 16th century, Christian symbols and paraphernalia (like [[rosaries]], [[crucifixes]], and [[holy water]]) became [[Fetishism|fetish]] objects, and [[Latin]] prayers and verses became part of the shaman's repertoire of magical chants and spells. ''Anito'' images (''taotao'') were replaced by Catholic idols and their rituals [[syncretism|syncretized]], including attributing ''anito''-like powers to them like miraculous healing from touching them or an ability to [[spirit possession|possess]] people.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Examples include the festivals of the [[Black Nazarene]] and the [[Santo Niño de Cebú]] (McCoy, 1982)&lt;/ref&gt; These flourished as they were tolerated by the Spanish clergy as "[[white magic]]". Nature spirits (''[[diwata]]'') during this period were also syncretized with the friars themselves, they became known as ''engkanto'' and began to be described as having European features with a propensity for deceiving, seducing, and playing tricks on people.&lt;ref name="demetrio73"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aguilar98"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mccoy"/&gt;

The previously high status of the ''babaylan'' was lost. The role of women and the relative [[Gender equality|gender egalitarianism]] of Philippine animistic cultures in general became more subdued under the [[patriarchal]] culture of the Spanish. Most ''babaylan'' were stigmatized by the Catholic clergy as [[witch]]es, [[satanist]]s, or mentally unstable. A few however were assimilated by the church and syncretized their roles into [[mysticism]] in the Christian context, becoming [[Faith healing|faith healers]] and miracle workers.&lt;ref name="liturgy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="peletz2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael G. Peletz|editor =|title =Gender Pluralism: Southeast Asia Since Early Modern Times|chapter =|publisher =Routledge|series =|year =2009|page=84|isbn = 9781135954895|url =https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=HGOTAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include the ''beata'' movement in the 17th and 18th century, the [[Messianism|messianic]] (and usually [[Rebellion|revolutionary]]) ''[[dios-dios]]'' movement of the late 19th century, and the ''espiritista'' (or ''spiritista'') movement of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="salazar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mallari2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/the-filipina-as-ritualist-and-warrior/81079/|title=The Filipina as ritualist and warrior|author=Perry Gil S.

The faith healers are still in essence, mediums; but instead of channeling ''anito'', they instead claim to channel [[Saint#Catholic Church|saints]], [[Angel#Christianity|angels]], or the [[Holy Spirit in Christianity|Holy Spirit]].&lt;ref name="apostol"/&gt; Late 20th century and 21st century faith healers also frequently use western [[western esotericism|esoteric]] and [[pseudoscientific]] terminology and practices (like "[[Energy (esotericism)|psychic energy]]" and [[psychic surgery]]), with little connection to traditional shamanic religions.&lt;ref name="salazar"/&gt;
[[File:Babaylan Festival in Bago City.jpg|thumb|A performer depicting a shaman in the 2015 [[Babaylan Festival]] of [[Bago, Negros Occidental]]]]
Others abandoned the animistic aspects of shamanism and became folk healers (''[[arbularyo]]''),&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Derived from Spanish ''herbolario'' ("herbalist"). These generalist healers were also known by the Spanish as ''mediquillos'', ''saludadores'', or ''curanderos'' (Marco, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; [[midwives]], and practitioners of traditional ''hilot'' massage therapy with oils. These modern versions of ''babaylan'' are now usually male (except midwives). They are usually sought out in minor aliments and in illnesses that modern medicine can not diagnose or cure. Like in ancient ''babaylan'', modern ''babaylan'' distinguish between "spiritual diseases" and "natural diseases", the latter they will usually refer to a medical doctor.&lt;ref name="peletz2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="salazar"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Zeus A. Salazar|year=2007|title=Faith Healing in the Philippines: An Historical Perspective|journal=Asian Studies|volume=43|issue=2|pages=1&amp;ndash;15|url=http://asj.upd.edu.ph/mediabox/archive/ASJ-43-02-2007/Faith%20Healing%20in%20the%20Philippines%20Zeus%20Salazar.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="apostol"/&gt;&lt;ref name="berdon2016"&gt;{{cite journal|author=ZachiaRaiza Joy S.

Similarly, among [[Muslim Filipinos]], shamans, usually male, are now relegated to folk healing and in dealing with "indigenous" spirits. All other aspects of the religious life of Muslim Filipinos have been taken over by [[Islamic religious leaders]].&lt;ref name="eller"/&gt; A direct equivalent of the Christian Filipino "faith healers" and ''albolaryo'' are Islamized shamans known as ''pandita'' or ''guru''. They follow Islam but also provide traditional healing practices and cultural rituals retained from their shamanistic past. They usually perform minor rites like ''[[aqiqah]]'' (cutting the hair of the firstborn) and ''[[Exorcism in Islam|ruqqiya]]'' (exorcism).&lt;ref name="loyre"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ghislaine Loyre|year=1998|title=Foreig Influences on Muslim Rituals|journal=Philippine Studies|volume=46|issue=4|pages=429&amp;ndash;451|doi=|url=http://www.philippinestudies.net/files/journals/1/articles/2591/public/2591-2589-1-PB.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="morales2017"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mindanews.com/mindaviews/2017/07/peacetalk-understanding-the-typology-of-filipino-muslim-religious-leaders/|title=PEACETALK: Understanding the typology of Filipino Muslim religious leaders|author=Yusuf Morales|date=26 July 2017|publisher=MindaNews|accessdate=6 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A version of the traditional massage therapy conducted by folk healers also exist, known as ''agud'' or ''agod'' among the [[Maranao people|Maranao]] and [[Maguindanao people]].&lt;ref name="apostol"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jadedragon.com/tao_heal/healingarts1.html|title=The Healing Arts of the Philippines|author=Virgil J. Mayor Apostol|publisher=Jade Dragon Online|accessdate=6 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most strongly affected by this religious shift to [[Abrahamic religions]] were the feminized male ''asog'' shamans. During the 17th to 18th centuries, Spanish administrators in the Philippines burned people convicted of homosexual relations at the stake and confiscated their possessions, in accordance to a decree by the president of the [[Real Audiencia]], Pedro Hurtado Desquibel. Several instances of such punishments were recorded by the Spanish priest Juan Francisco de San Antonio in his ''Chronicas de la Apostolica Provincia de San Gregorio'' (1738&amp;ndash;1744).&lt;ref name="garcia2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="garcia2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://panitikan.ph/2014/06/23/philippine-gay-culture-conclusion/|title=Philippine Gay Culture: Conclusion|author=J. Neil C. Garcia|date=23 June 2014|publisher=Panitikan: Philippine Literature Portal|accessdate=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminized men were also persecuted harshly in the (then recently) Islamized ethnic groups in [[Mindanao]]. In ''Historia de las Islas de Mindanao, Iolo, y sus adyacentes'' (1667), the Spanish priest [[Francisco Combés]] records that their "unnatural crime" was punished by the Muslim peoples in Mindanao with death by burning or drowning, and that their houses and property were also burned as they believed that it was contagious.&lt;ref name="garcia2008"/&gt;

== Resistance against colonial rule==
A few followers of the native shamanism resisted Spanish rule and conversion, especially in areas difficult to reach for Spanish missionaries, like the highlands of [[Luzon]] and the interiors of [[Mindanao]]. In Spanish-controlled areas (especially in the [[Visayas]]), entire villages would defy the policies of ''[[reducciónes]]'' (resettlement) and move deeper into the island interiors at the instigation of their ''babaylan''. Shamanistic rituals also continued to be performed secretly in some areas, though these were punished by the Spanish clergy when discovered.&lt;ref name="aguilar98"/&gt;

Open revolts led by shamans were common during Spanish rule. Aside from the early revolts in the 17th century, most of these were led by religious leaders who practiced [[Folk Catholicism]] rather than true shamanism.&lt;ref name="marco2001"/&gt;

===17th century===
The first recorded armed revolt led by a ''babaylan'' was the [[Tamblot uprising]] of [[Bohol]] in 1621&amp;ndash;1622. It was led by a male shaman named [[Tamblot]] who saw the spread of Catholicism as a threat. He rallied around two thousand followers in an effort to "return to the old ways", but his rebellion was crushed by the Spanish authorities with the help of converted native auxiliaries.&lt;ref name="woods2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Damon L. Woods|title =The Philippines: A Global Studies Handbook|publisher =ABC-CLIO|year =2006|isbn =9781851096756|url =https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=2Z-n_kDTxf0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tamblot's revolt inspired another rebellion in neighboring [[Carigara, Leyte]] in the same time period. The [[Bankaw revolt]] was led by a ''[[datu]]'' named Bankaw and his son Pagali who was a ''babaylan''. Bankaw's rebellion was notable as Bankaw was one of the first converts to Catholicism in the Philippines. As a young man, he had formerly welcomed the ''[[conquistador]]'' [[Miguel López de Legazpi]] in 1565 when their expedition first landed on the islands. Like Tamblot, Bankaw and Pagali both wanted a return to the old ways. Bankaw renounced his Catholic faith and built a temple to a ''[[diwata]]''.&lt;ref name="woods2006"/&gt; Their rebellion was defeated by the Spanish [[Governor-general]] [[Alonso Fajardo de Entenza]]. Bankaw was beheaded, while Pagali and eighty-one other ''babaylan'' were [[Death by burning|burned at the stake]].&lt;ref name="duka"&gt;{{cite book|author= Cecilio D. Duka|title =Struggle for Freedom|publisher =Rex Bookstore, Inc.|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=4wk8yqCEmJUC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year =2008|isbn =9789712350450|pages=99–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tapar rebellion]] was an uprising in [[Iloilo]], [[Panay]] led by a ''babaylan'' named Tapar in 1663. Tapar syncretized native shamanism with Catholic terminology and declared himself "God Almighty" of a new religion. He also emulated the ancient ''asog'' by dressing up in women's clothing. He and his followers killed a Spanish priest and burned the town church before escaping to the mountains. Tapar and other leaders of his movement were captured and executed by Spanish and Filipino soldiers.&lt;ref name="woods2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="duka"/&gt;

===18th century===
A religious uprising in 1785 in Ituy (modern [[Aritao]]), [[Nueva Vizcaya]] was led by a healer named Lagutao. He claimed that an outbreak of [[smallpox]] in [[northern Luzon]] was a result of the natives abandoning their ancestral beliefs. It was suppressed by neighboring Christian townsmen led by [[Dominican friar]]s.&lt;ref name="marco2001"/&gt;

===19th century===
The 19th century saw the rise of the ''dios-dios'' "shamans". ''Dios-dios'' (literally "[[False prophet|god pretender]]" or "false god", from Spanish ''dios'') were religious leaders so named because of their penchant for identifying themselves with Christian religious figures. They led [[cult]]-like religious movements, promising prosperity, supernatural powers, or healing to their followers. Most were mere [[charlatan]]s selling amulets and magical pieces of paper. Their members were mostly from the illiterate rural poor who had little knowledge of formal Catholic teachings and were living in extreme poverty under colonial rule.&lt;ref name="marco2001"/&gt;
[[File:"Papa Isio" (Dionisio Magbuelas) (1907).jpg|thumb|[[Papa Isio]] with two ''babaylanes'' followers in a prison in [[Bacolod]] after his surrender to American authorities in 1907. Note his "[[Papal vestments]]" and the woman's dress worn by the man to his left.]]
There are numerous examples of ''dios-dios'' leaders in the 19th century. They include Lungao, a healer from [[Ilocos]] who claimed he was Jesus Christ in 1811; Ignacio Dimas, who led the "Tres Cristos" of [[Libmanan]], [[Nueva Cáceres]] (modern [[Camarines Sur]]) who claimed they had supernatural powers over diseases in 1865; Benedicta, an old woman and a healer who called herself "La Santa de Leyte" in 1862 and prophesied that the island of [[Leyte]] would sink;&lt;ref name="marco2001"/&gt; Clara Tarrosa, an eighty-year old ''babaylan'' in [[Tigbauan]], Iloilo in the late 1880s who proclaimed herself the [[Virgin Mary]] and isolated herself and her followers from Spanish rule;&lt;ref name="davis2002"/&gt; Francisco Gonzalez (alias "Francisco Sales" or "Fruto Sales") of [[Jaro, Leyte]] who claimed in 1888 that he was a king sent to save people from another [[Genesis flood narrative|great flood]] by leading them to a city that would rise from the waves; and many more. These movements were usually suppressed by the Spanish by imprisoning their leaders or exiling them.&lt;ref name="marco2001"/&gt;

The ''dios-dios'' movement was initially purely religious, only reacting defensively to Spanish persecution. However, by the 1880s, some ''dios-dios'' groups became more violently anti-colonial. The first such group was the one led by [[Ponciano Elofre]], a ''[[cabeza de barangay]]'' of a ''[[sitio]]'' of [[Zamboanguita]], [[Negros Oriental]]. He took the name "Dios Buhawi" ("Whirlwind God") and proclaimed himself the savior of the people. He declared that they would stop paying taxes to the Spanish government. He formed a community of around two thousand followers (whom the Spanish authorities called the ''babaylanes'') and would regularly attack Spanish-controlled towns. Emulating the ancient ''asog'' shamans, he dressed in women's clothing and assumed feminine mannerisms even though he was married to a woman. He claimed supernatural powers much like the ancient ''dalagangan''. He was killed while attacking the town of [[Siaton]] in 1887. His wife and relatives attempted to continue the movement, but they were eventually captured and exiled by Spanish authorities. The remnants of the group either descended to banditry or joined other later ''dios-dios'' movements.&lt;ref name="mccoy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aguilar98"/&gt;&lt;ref name="marco2001"/&gt;

Another ''dios-dios'' uprising was led by a shaman named [[Gregorio Lampinio]] (better known as "Gregorio Dios", and also known as "Hilario Pablo" or "Papa") in [[Antique (province)|Antique]] from 1888. The uprising was formed near [[Mount Balabago]], a sacred pilgrimage site for shamans. Lampinio led a force of around 400 people. They collected ''contribuciones babaylanes'' (a [[revolutionary tax]]), disseminated anti-colonial ideas, and launched attacks on towns in Antique and Iloilo. The group was eventually suppressed by the [[Civil Guard (Philippines)|Guardia Civil]] by 1890.&lt;ref name="marco2001"/&gt;

The last significant ''dios-dios'' rebellion in the 19th century was led by [[Dionisio Magbuelas]], better known as Papa Isio ("Pope Isio"). He was a former member of the Dios Buhawi group. He organized his own ''babaylanes'' group from remnants of Elofre's followers and led an uprising in [[Negros Occidental]] in 1896 against Spanish rule. After the Philippines was ceded to the United States after the [[Spanish–American War]], he was initially made "military chief" of [[La Castellana, Negros Occidental]] under the [[United States Military Government of the Philippine Islands|American government]]. However, he picked up armed resistance again in 1899 in the [[Philippine–American War]]. He surrendered in August 6, 1907 to American authorities and was sentenced to death. This was later commuted to life imprisonment and he died in the [[Manila Bilibid Prison]] in 1911.&lt;ref name="constantino1975"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sa-onoy"&gt;{{cite book | author=[[Modesto P.

===20th century===
Concurrent with Papa Isio's rebellion in Negros Occidental against American rule, the ''dios-dios'' movement in eastern Visayas turned their attention to the new [[Insular Government of the Philippine Islands|American colonial government]]. Calling themselves the [[Pulajanes]] ("those who wear red"), they were led by Faustino Ablen ("Papa Faustino") in [[Leyte]]; and Pablo Bulan ("Papa Pablo"), Antonio Anugar, and Pedro de la Cruz in [[Samar]]. Like their predecessors, they claimed supernatural powers and used fetishistic amulets, holy oils, and magic spells in battle. They attacked both American troops and local Filipinos cooperating with the American colonial government. The last Pulajanes leader was killed in 1911.&lt;ref name="marco2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="constantino1975"&gt;{{cite book|author=Renato Constantino &amp; Letizia R.

=== ''The Art of Sinking in Poetry'' ===
{{main|Peri Bathous, Or the Art of Sinking in Poetry}}
As the combination of the very high with the very low, the term was introduced by [[Alexander Pope]] in his essay ''[[Peri Bathous, Or the Art of Sinking in Poetry]]'' (1727).  On the one hand, Pope's work is a [[parody]] in prose of [[Longinus (literature)|Longinus]]' ''Peri Hupsous'' (''[[On the Sublime]]''), in that he imitates Longinus's system for the purpose of ridiculing contemporary poets, but, on the other, it is a blow Pope struck in an ongoing struggle against the "dunces."

The nearest model for Pope's essay is the ''Treatise of the Sublime'' by [[Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux|Boileau]] of 1712.  Pope admired Boileau, but one of Pope's literary adversaries, [[Leonard Welsted]], had issued a "translation" of Longinus in 1726 that was merely a translation of Boileau.  Because Welsted and Pope's other foes were championing this "sublime," Pope commented upon and countered their system with his ''Peri Bathos'' in the [[Jonathan Swift|Swift]]-[[Alexander Pope|Pope]]-[[John Gay|Gay]]-[[John Arbuthnot|Arbuthnot]] ''Miscellanies.''  Whereas Boileau had offered a detailed discussion of all the ways in which poetry could ascend or be "awe-inspiring," Pope offers a lengthy schematic of the ways in which authors might "sink" in poetry, [[satire|satirizing]] the very men who were allied with [[Ambrose Philips]].  Pope and Philips had been adversaries since the publication of Pope's ''Odes,'' and the rivalry broke down along political lines. According to Pope, bathos can be most readily applicable to love making after two years of marriage which is clearly in binary opposition to the sublime but is no less political. [[Edmund Burke]] was believed to be particularly charmed by Pope's articulation of love after marriage, inspiring Burke's essay [[A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful]] (1756).

One example of Pope's style and satire shows in his description of sinking in painting.  In the commonplace Academic hierarchic ranking of pictorial [[genre]]s, [[still life]] ranked the lowest.  However, Pope describes how it might fall and, with the single word "stiffen," evokes the unnatural deadness that is a mark of failure even in this [[Hierarchy of genres|"low" genre]]:

:''Many Painters who could never hit a Nose or an Eye, have with Felicity copied a Small-Pox, or been admirable at a Toad or a Red-Herring. And seldom are we without Genius's for Still Life, which they can work up and stiffen with incredible Accuracy''. ("Peri Bathous" vi).

In chapters X and XI, Pope explains the comic use of the [[Trope (literature)|tropes]] and [[figures of speech]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=William Kurtz |last=Wimsatt |authorlink=William Kurtz Wimsatt, Jr. |year=1989 |origyear=1954 |title=The Verbal Icon: Studies in the Meaning of Poetry |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=KmrUKcU2JUoC&amp;pg=PA176 176] |publisher=[[University Press of Kentucky]] |location=Lexington, Kentucky |isbn=978-0-8131-0111-8 |oclc=19554431}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Pope's manual of bad verse offers numerous methods for writing poorly, of all these ways to "sink," the method that is most remembered now is the act of combining very serious matters with very trivial ones. The radical juxtaposition of the serious with the frivolous does two things.  First, it violates "decorum," or the fittingness of subject, and, second, it creates humor with an unexpected and improper juxtaposition.

=== Subsequent evolution ===
Since Pope's day, the term "bathos," perhaps because of confusion with "[[pathos]]," has been used for art forms, and sometimes events, where something is so ''pathetic'' as to be humorous.

When artists consciously mix the very serious with the very trivial, the effect is of [[Surreal humour]] and [[absurd humor|the absurd]].  However, when an artist is unconscious of the juxtaposition (e.g., when a film maker means for [[Robot Monster|a man in a gorilla suit with a diving helmet]] to be frightening), the result is bathos.

Arguably, some forms of [[kitsch]] (notably the replication of serious or sublime subjects in a trivial context, like tea-towels with prints of [[Titian|Titian's]] ''Last Supper'' on them or hand guns that are actually cigarette lighters){{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} express bathos in the concrete arts.

A tolerant but detached enjoyment of the aesthetic characteristics that are inherent in naive, unconscious and honest bathos is an element of the [[Camp (style)|camp sensibility]], as first analyzed by [[Susan Sontag]], in a 1964 essay [http://www.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/theory/Sontag-NotesOnCamp-1964.html "Notes on camp"].

=== 17th and 18th centuries ===
Bathos as Pope described it may be found in a grandly rising thought that punctures itself: Pope offers one "Master of a Show in Smithfield, who wrote in large Letters, over the Picture of his Elephant:
:"This is the greatest Elephant in the World, except Himself."

Several decades before Pope coined the term, [[John Dryden]] had described one of the breath-taking and magically extravagant settings for his [[Restoration spectacular]], ''[[Albion and Albanius]]'' (1684–85):
:"The cave of [[Proteus]] rises out of the sea, it consists of several arches of rock work, adorned with mother of pearl, coral, and abundance of shells of various kinds. Through the arches is seen the sea, and parts of [[Dover|Dover pier]]."

Pope himself employed this type of figure intentionally for humor in his mock-heroic ''[[Rape of the Lock]],'' where a lady would be upset at the death of a lover "or lapdog."  [[Søren Kierkegaard]], in ''The Sickness Unto Death,'' did the same thing, when he suggested that the "self" is easy to lose and that the loss of "an arm, a leg, a dog, or a wife" would be more grievous.  When intended, this is a form of satire or the literary figure of ''undercutting.''  When the context demands a lofty, serious, or grand interpretation, however, the effect is bathos.

[[Image:William Hogarth - The Bathos.png|thumb|right|Hogarth's ''The Bathos'']]

In 1764, [[William Hogarth]] published his last engraving, ''The Bathos, or the Manner of Sinking in Sublime Paintings inscribed to Dealers in Dark Pictures'', depicting [[Father Time]] lying exhausted in a scene of destruction, [[parody]]ing the fashion at that time for "[[wikt:sublime|sublime]]" works of art, and [[satire|satirising]] criticisms made of Hogarth's own works.  It may also be seen as a ''[[vanitas]]'' or ''[[memento mori]]'', foreshadowing Hogarth's death six months later.  Headed ''Tail Piece'', it was intended as the [[tailpiece]] for a bound edition of Hogarth's engravings.

== Examples ==

===Traditional===
[[Alfred Lord Tennyson]]'s [[narrative poem]] ''[[Enoch Arden]]'' ends with the following lines:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;So past the strong heroic soul away.
And when they buried him the little port
Had seldom seen a costlier funeral.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After stanzas of heightened poetic language, the poet, in three short lines, wraps up a [[pathos]]-laden story with mundane and practical details. The effect yanks the reader out of the poetic world, simultaneously offering commentary on the finality of death and the transience of heroics.

A musical representation is found in composer [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s 1923 [[Octet (Stravinsky)|Octet]] for wind instruments. The first two movements and the majority of the third movement follow traditional classical structures, albeit employing modern and innovative harmonies. The last fifteen seconds of the 25-minute work, however, abruptly and whimsically turn to popular harmony, rhythm, and style found in contemporary dance hall music.

=== Modern ===
{{quote|"Moviemakers talk about "bad laughs." That's when the audience laughs when it's not supposed to.

Contemporary examples often take the form of analogies, written to seem unintentionally funny:

The [[Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest]] features [[purple prose]], at times exhibiting bathos:
:They had but one last remaining night together, so they embraced each other as tightly as that two-flavor entwined string cheese that is orange and yellowish-white, the orange probably being a bland Cheddar and the white . . . Mozzarella, although it could possibly be Provolone or just plain American, as it really doesn't taste distinctly dissimilar from the orange, yet they would have you believe it does by coloring it differently.

Legendary [[darts]] commentator [[Sid Waddell]] was famed for his one-liners, including this example:
:“When Alexander of Macedonia was 33, he cried salt tears because there were no more worlds to conquer..... [[Eric Bristow|Bristow]] is only 27.”

'''Boria''' ([[Jawi alphabet|Jawi]]: '''بوريا''') is a form of [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] [[theatre]] of [[India]]n origin which has through adaptive processes, become the one and only theatre of Malay community in [[Penang]], [[Malaysia]]&lt;ref name="reference 1"&gt;{{cite book |title=Boria: a form of Malay theatre (Local history and memoirs)|pages=xii,1 &amp; 2|author=Rahmah Bujang|isbn=978-9971-988-58-6|year= 1987|publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Records on the origin of Boria are fairly limited but it was first mentioned by H.T. Haughton in 1897 which according to him, it was first brought to Penang in 1845 by the [[Muslim]] soldiers of 21st [[Madras Regiment]]. It was originally played to celebrate the annual [[Shiite]] festival, the [[Mourning of Muharram]]. In 1910, R.J Wilkinson, a Straits Civil Service officer and a noted scholar of Malay studies, made a comparison between the boria of [[Madras]] and [[Penang]], and established that the resemblance was only in name, for the show as then known in Penang had evolved to a totally different form.&lt;ref name="reference 1" /&gt;

==The performance==
A typical Boria troupe consists of a leader, a chorus, comedians and musicians. The performance normally begins with a short comic sketches and followed by a song-dance routine featuring a juxtaposition of choral and solo parts. The song-dance routine commonly performed in a western music style and with dance forms such as [[rhumba|rumba]]s, [[cha-cha-cha (dance)|cha-cha-cha]] or soul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dancemalaysia.com/Dance/Traditional/Folk_Dance/Boria/boria.htm|title=Boria|publisher=Dance Malaysia|accessdate=28 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicmall-asia.com/malaysia/folk/boria.html |title=Music for Theater: Boria |publisher=Musicmall Production Pte Ltd |year=2004 |accessdate=28 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514005605/https://www.musicmall-asia.com/malaysia/folk/boria.html |archivedate=14 May 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boria’s theme varies from Arab warriors, European traders to Chinese shopkeepers around which the costumes and comic improvisations revolved. The main melodic instruments has consistently [[violin]] but various Western, Malay, or Indian drums and Chinese cymbals are also used in the performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Garland Handbook of Southeast Asian Music|page=236 &amp; 237|author=Terry Miller &amp;  Sean Williams|isbn=978-0-415-96075-5|year= 2008|publisher=Routledge }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Caves and Ice Age Art in the Swabian Jura''' are a collection of six caves in southern [[Germany]] which were used by [[Ice Age]] humans for shelter about 33,000 to 43,000 years ago.  The caves are located in the Lone and Ach Valleys.  Within the caves one statuette of a female form, carved figurines of animals (including cave lions, mammoths, horses and cattle), musical instruments and items of personal adornment have been discovered.  Some of the figurines depict creatures that are half animal, half human.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1527/ |title=Caves and Ice Age Art in the Swabian Jura |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chryse''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|r|aɪ|s|i|,_|ˈ|k|r|aɪ|z|i}} ({{lang-el|Χρύση|Khrúsē|Golden}}) was a small island in the [[Aegean Sea]] mentioned by [[Homer]], [[Sophocles]] and [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]].

The island's main feature was said to be its temple to [[Apollo]], and its patron deity a goddess named [[Chryse (goddess)|Chryse]]. The Greek archer [[Philoctetes]] stopped there on his way to [[Troy]] and was fatally bitten by a [[Viperidae|viper]]. [[Lucullus]] captured three men there in an ambush during the [[Third Mithridatic War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gillies|first=John|title=The history of ancient Greece: its colonies and conquests; from the earliest accounts till the division of the Macedonian empire in the East.

The ''[[Description of Greece]]'' says:
{{Quote|The following incident proves the might of Fortune to be greater and more marvellous than is shown by the disasters and prosperity of cities. No long sail from [[Lemnos]] was once an island Chryse, where, it is said, Philoctetes met with his accident from the water-snake. But the waves utterly overwhelmed it, and Chryse sank and disappeared in the depths... So temporary and utterly weak are the fortunes of men.|Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'' 8.33.4}}

An amateur underwater archaeologist claimed to have rediscovered the island in 1960, identifying it with "a sunken land mass known as Kharos Bank, a 10-sq.-mi. area near the island of [[Lemnos]]", listed on British naval charts and located about {{convert|40|ft|m}} below the surface. White building blocks (presumably from Apollo's temple) were said to be visible on the sea floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,873343,00.html|title=Philoctetes Was Here|magazine=''TIME'' magazine|date=December 19, 1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kharos Bank is mentioned by others as a possible site, but there does not appear to have been further work on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harrison|first=S.

'''Codicology''' (from [[Latin]] {{Lang|la|[[codex]]}}, [[genitive]] {{Lang|la|codicis}}, "notebook, book"; 
and [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{Lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[-logy|-logia]]'') is the study of [[codex|codices]] or manuscript books written on parchment (or paper) as physical objects. It is often referred to as 'the archaeology of the book', concerning itself with the materials ([[parchment]], sometimes referred to as membrane or [[vellum]], [[paper]], pigments, inks and so on), and techniques used to make books, including their binding.

There are no clear-cut definitions: some codicologists say that their field encompasses [[palaeography]], the study of handwriting, while some palaeographers say that their field encompasses codicology. The study of written features such as [[marginalia]], [[glosses]], ownership inscriptions, etc. falls in both camps, as does the study of the [[illuminated manuscript|physical aspects of decoration]], which otherwise belongs to [[art history]].

By a close examination of the physical attributes of a book, it is sometimes possible to establish the history and provenance of a book, or to match up long-separated elements originally from the same book.  Palaeographers and codicologists may also study the history of libraries, manuscript-collecting and of book-cataloguing.

'''Nontraditional casting''', '''integrated casting''', or sometimes '''color-blind/gender-blind casting''' is the practice of [[casting (performing arts)|casting]] without considering the actor's [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], [[Human skin color|skin color]] and/or [[gender]]. A representative of the [[Actors' Equity Association]] has disputed the use of the term "color blind", preferring the definition "nontraditional casting". Nontraditional casting "is defined as the casting of ethnic minority actors in roles where race or ethnicity is not germane".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

'''Criticism of the [[United States government]]''' encompasses a wide range of sentiments about the actions and policies of the United States.

==Foreign policy==

[[File:Saddam rumsfeld.jpg|thumb|210px|Iraqi President [[Saddam Hussein]] greets [[Donald Rumsfeld]], a special envoy of President [[Ronald Reagan]], in Baghdad on December 20, 1983. Rumsfeld came to discuss an aid program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB82/ Shaking Hands with Saddam Hussein: The U.S. Tilts toward Iraq, 1980–1984.] National Security Archive, Electronic Briefing Book No. 82. Ed. by Joyce Battle, February 25, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The U.S. has been criticized for making statements supporting peace and respecting national sovereignty, but while carrying out military actions such as in [[invasion of Grenada|Grenada]], fomenting [[Separation of Panama from Colombia|a civil war in Colombia to break off Panama]], and [[Iraq War|Iraq]]. The U.S. has been criticized for advocating [[free trade]] but while protecting local industries with import [[tariffs]] on foreign goods such as lumber&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4374502.stm|title=Canada attacks U.S. on wood tariffs|publisher=[[BBC]]|date= 2005-10-25|accessdate=24 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and agricultural products. The U.S. has also been criticized for advocating concern for [[human rights]] while refusing to ratify the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]]. The U.S. [[Torture and the United States|has publicly stated that it is opposed to torture]], but has been criticized for condoning it in the [[School of the Americas]]. The U.S. has advocated a respect for national sovereignty but has supported internal guerrilla movements and paramilitary organizations, such as the [[Contras]] in [[Nicaragua]].&lt;ref name=boston&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2007/05/24/report_hits_us_on_human_rights/?rss_id=Boston+Globe+--+World+News|title=Report hits U.S. on human rights|publisher=[[Associated Press]] (published on [[The Boston Globe]])|first=Raphael|last=Satter|date=2007-05-24|accessdate=2007-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/wr2k2/us.html|title=World Report 2002: United States|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]|accessdate=2007-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. has been criticized for voicing concern about narcotics production in countries such as [[Bolivia]] and [[Venezuela]] but doesn't follow through on cutting certain bilateral aid programs.&lt;ref name=tws21dec112&gt;{{cite news|title = U.S. keeps Venezuela, Bolivia atop narcotics list|publisher = ''Reuters''|date = September 16, 2009|url = https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE58F51320090916|accessdate = 2009-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some defenders argue that a policy of rhetoric while doing things counter to the rhetoric was necessary in the sense of [[realpolitik]] and helped secure victory against the dangers of [[tyranny]] and [[totalitarianism]].&lt;ref name="tws21dec412c"&gt;{{cite news|author = Bootie Cosgrove-Mather|title = Democracy And Reality|publisher = [[CBS News]] |date = February 1, 2005 |url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/02/01/opinion/main670834.shtml |accessdate = 2009-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. has been criticized for supporting dictatorships with economic assistance and military hardware.

The U.S. has been criticized by [[Noam Chomsky]] for opposing nationalist movements in foreign countries, including social reform.&lt;ref name="R000101"&gt;{{cite news |first=Noam |last=Chomsky |authorlink=Noam Chomsky |title=The Israel Lobby? |date=2006-03-28 |url=http://www.zmag.org/znet/viewArticle/4134 |work=[[ZNet]] |accessdate=2009-01-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://swap.stanford.edu/20090417172541/http://www.zmag.org/znet/viewArticle/4134 |archivedate=2009-04-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Noam Chomsky on America's Foreign Policy|url=https://www.pbs.org/now/news/239.html|publisher=PBS|accessdate=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=March 2010}}

President [[George W.

In 1930–1940 the US collaborated with Stalin regime by building around 1500 factories in the USSR using a slave labor of political prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How We Built the Soviet Might |url=http://ashbrook.org/programs/citizens/publications/books/no-left-turns-contents/soviet-might/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The USA also covered up genocide of East Ukraine in 1932–1933, that [[Holodomor|killed between 4 and 6 millions of Ukrainians]] and in the midst of it established a diplomatic relationship with the USSR.

There has been sharp criticism about the [[International response to the Holocaust#United States|U.S. response to the Holocaust]]: That it failed to admit Jews fleeing persecution from Europe at the beginning of [[World War II]], and that it did not act decisively enough to prevent or stop the Holocaust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007411|work=[[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]]|accessdate=10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Joseph J.

Critic Robert McMahon thinks [[United States Congress|Congress]] has been excluded from foreign policy decision making, and that this is detrimental.&lt;ref name=tws21dec114&gt;{{cite news|author1=Robert McMahon |author2=Council on Foreign Relations |title = The Impact of the 110th Congress on U.S. Foreign Policy|publisher = ''Washington Post''|date = December 24, 2007|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/24/AR2007122401588.html|accessdate = 2009-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other writers suggest a need for greater Congressional participation.&lt;ref name="tws22dec216oopp"&gt;{{cite news|author = Jessica Tuchman Mathews|title = Six Years Later: Assessing Long-Term Threats, Risks and the U.S. Strategy for Security in a Post-9/11 World|publisher = ''Carnegie Endowment for International Peace''|date = October 10, 2007   |url = http://www.carnegieendowment.org/publications/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=19637|accessdate = 2009-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jim Webb]], former Democratic senator from Virginia and former [[Secretary of the Navy]] in the [[Reagan administration]], believes that Congress has an ever-decreasing role in U.S. foreign policy making. September 11, 2001 precipitated this change, where "powers quickly shifted quickly to the Presidency as the call went up for centralized decision making in a traumatized nation where, quick, decisive action was considered necessary. It was considered politically dangerous and even unpatriotic to question this shift, lest one be accused of impeding national safety during a time of war."&lt;ref name="Jim Webb NA"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Webb|first=Jim|title=Congressional Abdication|journal=The National Interest|date=March–April 2013|issue= 124|url=http://nationalinterest.org/article/congressional-abdication-8138|accessdate=11 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since that time, Webb thinks Congress has become largely irrelevant in shaping and executing of U.S. foreign policy. He cites the [[Strategic Framework Agreement]] (SFA), the [[U.S.-Afghanistan Strategic Partnership Agreement]], and the [[2011 military intervention in Libya]] as examples of growing legislative irrelevance. Regarding the SFA, "Congress was not consulted in any meaningful way. Once the document was finalized, Congress was not given the opportunity to debate the merits of the agreement, which was specifically designed to shape the structure of our long-term relations in Iraq" (11). "Congress did not debate or vote on this agreement, which set U.S. policy toward an unstable regime in an unstable region of the world."&lt;ref name="Jim Webb NA" /&gt; The [[Iraqi Parliament]], by contrast, voted on the measure twice. The U.S.-Afghanistan Strategic Partnership Agreement is described by the Obama Administration has a "legally binding executive agreement" that outlines the future of U.S.-Afghan relations and designated Afghanistan a [[major non-NATO ally]]. "It is difficult to understand how any international agreement negotiated, signed, and authored only by our executive branch of government can be construed as legally binding in our constitutional system," Webb argues.&lt;ref name="Jim Webb NA" /&gt;

Finally, Webb identifies the U.S. intervention in Libya as a troubling historical precedent. "The issue in play in Libya was not simply whether the president should ask Congress for a declaration of war. Nor was it wholly about whether Obama violated the edicts of the [[War Powers Resolution|War Powers Act]], which in this writer's view he clearly did. The issue that remains to be resolved is whether a president can unilaterally begin, and continue, a military campaign for reasons that he alone defines as meeting the demanding standards of a vital national interest worth of risking American lives and expending billions of dollars of taxpayer money."&lt;ref name="Jim Webb NA" /&gt; When the military campaign lasted months, President [[Barack Obama]] did not seek approval of Congress to continue military activity.&lt;ref name="Jim Webb NA" /&gt;

====Presidential incompetency====
One difficulty of the American government is that the lack of oversight for Presidents offers no safeguards for presidential incompetency.

Virtually every President in modern history has been criticized for incompetency in some fashion. However, there are little to no mechanisms in place to provide accountability. Since the only way to remove an incompetent president is with the rather difficult policy of [[impeachment]], it is possible for a marginally competent or incompetent president to stay in office for four to eight years and cause great mischief.&lt;ref name=tws10oct27&gt;{{cite web |author=Sanford Levinson |title=Constitution Day Essay 2008: Professor Sanford Levinson examines the dictatorial power of the Presidency  |publisher=University of Texas School of Law |date=September 17, 2008 |accessdate=2009-10-10

====Over-burdened presidency====
Presidents have not only foreign policy responsibilities, but sizable domestic duties too. In addition, the presidency is the head of a [[List of political parties in the United States|political party]]. As a result, it is tough for one person to manage disparate tasks, in one view. Many believe that this overburdened duty of presidents allows for incompetency in government.&lt;ref name=tws11janxzs&gt;{{cite news|author= Zbigniew Brzezinski|title= From Hope to Audacity: Appraising Obama's Foreign Policy (I)|publisher= ''Foreign Affairs''|date= 2001-10-20|url= http://geopolitikon.wordpress.com/2010/01/11/11ian2010-eurast-recomanda-z-brzezinski-face-bilantul-politicii-externe-a-primului-an-de-mandat-b-obama-i/|accessdate= 2010-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Presidents may lack experience====
Since the constitution requires no prior experience in diplomacy, government, or military service, it is possible to elect presidents with scant foreign policy experience. Clearly the record of past presidents confirms this, and that presidents who have had extensive diplomatic, military, and foreign policy experience have been the exception, not the rule. In recent years, presidents had relatively more experience in such tasks as peanut farming, [[Show business|acting]] and governing [[State government (United States)|governorships]] than in international affairs. It has been debated whether voters are sufficiently skillful to assess the foreign policy potential of presidential candidates, since foreign policy experience is only one of a long list of attributes in which voters tend to select candidates.&lt;ref name="tws21dec314a"/&gt; President Obama has been widely criticized as too inexperienced for the job, having only served in government for three years before his presidential election. However, party leadership and donors were adamant in their advocacy due his broad appeal, leading to a nominee with little experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/2007-01-16-obama-experience-cover_x.htm | title=The big question about Barack Obama | work=USA Today | accessdate=March 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, an increasing difficulty for providing well-versed Presidents is that the American people in recent years are, in increasing numbers, more distrustful of their government and longterm, career politicians. As such, inexperienced candidates often perform better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/11/amateurs-in-the-oval-office/407830/ | title=Amateurs in the Oval Office | work=The Atlantic | accessdate=March 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Excessive authority of the presidency====
In contrast to criticisms that presidential attention is divided into competing tasks, [[President of the United States#Critics of presidency.27s evolution|some critics charge that presidents have too much power]], and that there is the potential for [[tyranny]] or [[authoritarianism]]. Many presidents have circumvented the national security decision-making process, including Obama, Bush, Clinton, and Reagan, as well as others historically.&lt;ref name="tws21dec314a"/&gt; Many critics see a danger in too much executive authority.&lt;ref name=twsSEPvsnfl&gt;{{cite book| last = Nelson| first = Dana D.| title = Bad for Democracy: How the Presidency Undermines the Power of the People| publisher = ''University of Minnesota Press''| year = 2008| location = Minneapolis, Minnesota| page = 248| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qgAWphms5oMC&amp;pg=PA223&amp;lpg=PA223&amp;dq=Dana+Nelson+vanderbilt%3F+%22bad+for+democracy%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BQX29WpUEv&amp;sig=GltrU89mO36Cvo_7SoTOPL4R47s&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3X-3SpTnA46m8QbRrM2TDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false| isbn = 978-0-8166-5677-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=twsSEPnnxcvdf1&gt;{{cite news| title = The Conquest of Presidentialism| publisher = The Huffington Post| date = August 22, 2008| url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-sirota/the-conquest-of-president_b_120582.html| accessdate = 2009-09-20| first=David| last=Sirota}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=twsSEPnn4r56&gt;{{cite news| author = David Sirota| title = Why cult of presidency is bad for democracy| publisher = ''San Francisco Chronicle''| date = August 22, 2008| url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/08/21/EDCQ12G3M0.DTL| accessdate = 2009-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=twsSEPrt03&gt;{{cite news| author = David Sirota| title = U.S. moving toward czarism, away from democracy| publisher = ''San Francisco Chronicle''| date = January 18, 2009| url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/01/18/INGP158S4G.DTL&amp;type=printable| accessdate = 2009-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tws10oct44&gt;{{cite news| author = Sanford Levinson| title = "Wartime Presidents and the Constitution: From Lincoln to Obama" – speech by Sanford Levinson at Wayne Morse Center| publisher = ''Wayne Morse Center for Law and Politics''| date = February 5, 2009| url = http://www.uoregon.edu/~morse/democracy.html| accessdate = 2009-10-10}}{{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tws10oct21&gt;{{cite news| author = Anand Giridharadas| title = Edging Out Congress and the Public | publisher = ''New York Times''| date = September 25, 2009 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/26/us/26iht-currents.html| accessdate = 2009-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Life in Malaysia}}
The '''culture of Malaysia''' draws on the varied cultures of the different people of [[Malaysia]]. The first people to live in the area were [[Orang Asal|indigenous tribes]] that still remain; they were followed by the [[Malay people|Malays]], who moved there from mainland Asia in ancient times. [[Chinese culture|Chinese]] and [[Indian Culture|Indian]] cultural influences made their mark when trade began with those countries, and increased with immigration to Malaysia. Other cultures that heavily influenced that of Malaysia include [[Persian culture|Persian]], [[Arabic culture|Arabic]], and [[British culture|British]]. The many different ethnicities that currently exist in Malaysia have their own unique and distinctive cultural identities, with some crossover.

Arts and music have a long tradition in Malaysia, with Malay art dating back to the Malay sultanates. Traditional art was centred on fields such as carving, silversmithing, and weaving. [[Islam]]ic taboos restricted artwork depicting humans until the mid-20th century. Performing arts and shadow puppet shows are popular, and often show Indian influences. Various influences can be seen in architecture, from individual cultures in Malaysia and from other countries. Large modern structures have been built, including the tallest twin buildings in the world, the [[Petronas Twin Towers]]. Malaysian music has a variety of origins, and is largely based around percussion instruments. Much early Malaysian literature was based on Indian epics, which remained unchanged even as Malays converted to Islam; this has expanded in recent decades. English literature remained restricted to the higher class until the arrival of the printing press. Locally created Chinese and Indian literature appeared in the 19th century.

Cuisine is often divided along ethnic lines, but some dishes exist which have mixed foods from different ethnicities. Each major religious group has its major holy days declared as official holidays. Official holidays differ by state; the most widespread one is [[Hari Merdeka|Merdeka day]] which celebrates the independence of [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]]. Although festivals often stem from a specific ethnic background, they are celebrated by all people in Malaysia. Traditional sports are popular in Malaysia, while it has become a powerhouse in international sports such as [[badminton]]. Malaysia hosted the [[Commonwealth Games]] in 1998, the first Commonwealth Games where the torch passed through more countries than England and the host.

The Malaysian government has taken the step of defining Malaysian Culture through the "1971 National Culture Policy", which defined what was considered official culture, basing it around Malay culture and integrating Islamic influences. This especially affected language; only [[Malaysian language|Malay]] texts are considered official cultural texts. Government control over the media is strong, and most media outlets are related to the government in some way.

==Background==
[[File:Malaysia states named.png|thumb|600px|alt=Map of Malaysia with labels of each state and federal territory|[[Peninsular Malaysia]] (left) is 40% of [[Malaysia]]'s territory, and is predominately [[Islamic]]. The two states of [[East Malaysia]] are mostly [[Christian]]. The capital of Malaysia is [[Kuala Lumpur]].]]
[[Malaysia]] consists of two distinct geographical regions: [[Peninsular Malaysia]] and [[East Malaysia]]. Malaysia was formed when the [[Federation of Malaya]] merged with [[North Borneo]] (today the province of [[Sabah]]), [[Sarawak]], and [[Singapore]] (seceded 1965) in 1963,&lt;ref name="CIA Fact Book"/&gt; and cultural differences between Peninsular and East Malaysia remain. During the formation of Malaysia, executive power was vested in the [[Alliance Party (Malaysia)|Perikatan]] (later the  [[Barisan Nasional]]) coalition of three racially based political parties, namely the [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO), [[Malaysian Chinese Association]] (MCA), and [[Malaysian Indian Congress]] (MIC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.malaysia-today.net/mtcolumns/35825-was-merdeka-taken-or-was-it-given |title=Was Merdeka taken or was it given? |publisher=Malaysia-today.net |date=8 November 2010 |accessdate=15 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101111112802/http://www.malaysia-today.net/mtcolumns/35825-was-merdeka-taken-or-was-it-given |archivedate=11 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; UMNO has dominated the coalition from its inception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2777.htm |title=Malaysia |publisher=State.gov |date=14 July 2010 |accessdate=15 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Islam]] is the official [[state religion]], the [[Constitution of Malaysia]] guarantees [[freedom of religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=37973 |title=No Freedom of Worship for Muslims Says Court |publisher=Ipsnews.net |date=31 May 2007 |accessdate=15 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527203413/http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=37973 |archivedate=27 May 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Malaysian Chinese|Chinese]] have been settling in Malaysia for many centuries, and form the second-largest ethnic group.&lt;ref name="CIA Fact Book"/&gt; The first Chinese to settle in the [[Straits Settlements]], primarily in and around [[Malacca]], gradually adopted elements of Malaysian culture and intermarried with the Malaysian community and with this, a new ethnic group called emerged, the ''[[Peranakan]]'' ("Straits Chinese"). These Chinese have adopted Malay traditions while maintaining elements of Chinese culture such as their largely [[Buddhist]] and [[Taoist]] religion.&lt;ref name="library438"/&gt; The more common [[varieties of Chinese|Chinese varieties]] spoken in Peninsular Malaysia are [[Cantonese]], [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Hokkien]], [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]], [[Hainanese]], and [[Fuzhou]].&lt;ref name="CIA Fact Book"/&gt;

The [[Malaysian Indian|Indian]] community in Malaysia is the smallest of the three main ethnic groups, accounting for about 10&amp;nbsp;percent of the country's population. They speak a variety of South Asian languages.&lt;ref name="CIA Fact Book"/&gt; [[Tamil people|Tamils]], [[Malayalam language|Malayalees]], and [[Telugu people]] make up over 85&amp;nbsp;percent of the people of Indian origin in the country. Indian immigrants to Malaysia brought with them the [[Hindu]] and [[Sikh]] cultures. This included temples and [[Gurdwaras]], cuisine, and clothing. Hindu tradition remains strong in the Indian community of Malaysia. A community of Indians who have adopted Malay cultural practices also exists in [[Malacca]]. Though they remain Hindu, the [[Chitty|Chitties]] speak Bahasa Malaysia and dress and act as Malays.&lt;ref name="library438"/&gt;

Some Eurasians of mixed European and Malay descent live in Malaysia. A small community in [[Malacca]] are descendants of former Portuguese colonists who married Malay women. While they have adopted Malay culture, they speak their own language and are [[Catholic Church|Catholics]].&lt;ref name="library438"/&gt;

Each ethnic group has its own underlying culture that separates it from the others, and they have achieved different levels of integration. The Chinese have integrated with Malay culture in a number of areas, including parts of [[Terengganu]], and they form Malayanised groups such as the [[Peranakan|Baba Chinese]] in Malacca and the [[Sino-Kadazan]] of [[Sabah]]. Their years under combined British rule brought some joint sense of identity to all the ethnic groups, with English ideas and ideals providing some unifying features. A joint Malaysian culture can be seen in the symbiosis of the cultures of the people within it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Some cultural disputes exist between Malaysia and neighbouring [[Indonesia]]. The two countries share a similar cultural heritage, sharing many traditions and items.

Common artworks included ornamental [[kris]] and [[beetle nut]] sets. Luxurious textiles known as ''Songket'' are made, as well as traditional patterned [[batik]] fabrics. Indigenous East Malaysians are known for their wooden masks. Malaysian art has expanded only recently, as before the 1950s Islamic taboos about drawing people and animals were strong.&lt;ref name="Marshall"/&gt; Textiles such as the [[batik]], [[songket]], [[Pua Kumbu]], and [[tekat]] are used for decorations, often embroidered with a painting or pattern.

[[Earthenware]] has been developed in many areas. The [[Labu Sayong]] is a gourd-shaped clay jar that holds water. Perak is famous for these. Also used to store water is the angular [[Terenang]]. The [[belanga]] is a clay bowl used to cook, with a wide base that allows heat to spread easily.&lt;ref name="CultureandHeritage"/&gt; Carved wood is used as ornamentation for many items, such as doors and window panels.&lt;ref name="Marshall"/&gt; Woodcarving was never an industry, but an art. Traditional woodcarvers spent years simply preparing the wood, due to a belief that woodcarvers need to be a perfect match with their wood.

Colonialism also brought other art forms, such as the Portuguese [[Farapeira]] and [[Branyo]]. There are a variety of traditional dances, which often have very strong spiritual significance. Different tribes from west and east Malaysia have different dances.&lt;ref name="CultureandHeritage"/&gt;

In 2010, the Malaysian Art Culture was introduced to a new revival with the arrival of new independent galleries that focuses on the new contemporary young local artists.

Architecture in Malaysia is a combination of many styles, from Islamic and Chinese styles to those brought by European colonists.&lt;ref name="Marshall"/&gt; Malay architecture has changed due to these influences. Houses in the north are similar to those in Thailand, while those in the south are similar to those in [[Java]]. New materials, such as glasses and nails, were brought in by Europeans, changing the architecture.&lt;ref name="Vernacular"/&gt;  Houses are built for tropical conditions, raised on stilts with high roofs and large windows, allowing air to flow through the house and cool it down.&lt;ref name="CultureandHeritage"/&gt; Wood has been the main building material for much of Malaysia's history; it is used for everything from the simple ''kampung'' to royal palaces.&lt;ref name="Marshall"/&gt; In [[Negeri Sembilan]] traditional houses are entirely free of nails.&lt;ref name="CultureandHeritage"/&gt; Besides wood, other common materials such as bamboo and leaves were used.&lt;ref name="Vernacular"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hbp.usm.my/conservation/malayvernacular.htm|title=Malay Vernacular Architecture|author=Assoc.

The Oral Asal of East Malaysia live in [[longhouse]]s and water villages. Longhouses are elevated and on stilts, and can house 20 to 100 families. Water villages are also built on stilts, with houses connected with planks and most transport by boats.&lt;ref name="CultureandHeritage"/&gt;

Chinese architecture can be divided into two types, traditional and [[Baba Nyonya]]. Baba Nyonya households are made of colourful tiles and have large indoor courtyards. Indian architecture came with the Malaysian Indians, reflecting the architecture of southern India where most originated from. Some Sikh architecture was also imported.&lt;ref name="CultureandHeritage"/&gt; [[Malacca]], which was a traditional centre of trade, has a large variety of building styles. Large wooden structures such as the Palace of Sultan Mansur Shah exist from early periods. Chinese influence can be seen in brightly decorated temples and terraced shop houses.&lt;ref name="Marshall"/&gt; The largest remaining Portuguese structure in Malacca is the [[A Famosa]] fort. Other colonial building include the Dutch [[Stadthuys]],&lt;ref name="CultureandHeritage"/&gt; the Dutch Colonial town brick buildings, and buildings built by the British such as the Memorial Hall, which combines [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] and [[Islamic architecture]].&lt;ref name="Marshall"/&gt;

The shapes and sizes of houses differ from state to state. Common elements in Peninsular Malaysia include pitched roofs, verandahs, and high ceilings, raised on stilts for ventilation. The woodwork in the house is often intricately carved. The floors are at different levels depending on the function of the room.&lt;ref name="Vernacular"/&gt; Mosques have traditionally been based on [[Javanese people#Architecture|Javanese architecture]].&lt;ref name="Marshall"/&gt; In modern times, the government has promoted different projects, from the tallest twin buildings in the world, the [[Petronas Twin Towers]], to a whole garden city, [[Putrajaya]]. Malaysian firms are developing skyscraper designs that are specifically for tropical climates.&lt;ref name="Marshall"/&gt;

==Music==
{{main article|Music of Malaysia}}
Traditional Malay music and performing arts appear to have originated in the [[Kelantan]]-[[Patani (region)|Pattani]] region. The music is based around percussion instruments,&lt;ref name="Garland"/&gt; the most important of which is the [[gendang]] (drum).

Music is traditionally used for storytelling, celebrating life-cycle events, and at annual events such as the harvest.&lt;ref name="Garland"/&gt; Music was once used as a form of long-distance communication.&lt;ref name="Asiapac"/&gt; Traditional orchestra can be divided between two forms, the [[gamelan]] which plays melodies using gongs and string instruments, and the [[nobat (music)|nobat]] which uses wind instruments to create more solemn music.&lt;ref name="CultureandHeritage"/&gt;

Malay poetry is highly developed, and uses many forms.&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaMy"/&gt; A ''Hikayat'' is a traditional narrative, and stories written in that fashion are named using Hikayat followed by the name(s) of the protagonist(s). The ''pantun'' is a form of poetry used in many aspects of Malay culture. The ''Syair'' is another form of narrative, once very popular.&lt;ref name="Introduction"/&gt; The Hikayat form remains popular, and the pantun has spread from Malay to other languages.&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaMy"/&gt; Until the 19th&amp;nbsp;century, literature produced in Malaysia focused mainly on tales of royalty,&lt;ref name="Introduction"/&gt; as it was produced just for royalty.&lt;ref name="Marshall"/&gt; It was after this point that it expanded to other areas.&lt;ref name="Introduction"/&gt; The [[May 13 incident|race riots of 1969]] strongly influenced literature; the improvements of the economy in the 1980s brought about social changes and new forms of literature.&lt;ref name="Marshall"/&gt;

The first Malay literature was in Arabic script. The earliest known Malay writing is on the [[Terengganu Inscription Stone]], made in 1303.&lt;ref name="Marshall"/&gt; One of the more famous Malay works is the ''[[Sulalatus al-Salatin]]'', also known as the ''Sejarah Melayu'' (meaning "The Malay Annals"). It was originally recorded in the 15th&amp;nbsp;century, although it has since been edited;&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaMy"/&gt; the known version is from the 16th&amp;nbsp;century. The ''Hikaya Rajit Pasai'', written in the 15th&amp;nbsp;century, is another significant literary work.&lt;ref name="Marshall"/&gt; The ''Hikayat Hang Tuah'', or story of [[Hang Tuah]], tells the story of Hang Tuah and his devotion to his Sultan.&lt;ref name="Marshall"/&gt; This is the most famous Hikayat;&lt;ref name="Introduction"/&gt; it drew from the ''Sejarah Melayu''. Both have been nominated as world heritage items under the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) 'Memory of the World' programme.&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaMy"/&gt; Folktales such as the ''Hikayat Sang Kancil'', about a clever mouse deer, are popular, as are adventures such as ''Ramayana'', adapted from Indian epics. [[Munshi Abdullah]] (Abdullah bin Abdul Kadir), who lived from 1797 to 1854, is regarded as the father of Malay literature. ''Hikayat Abdullah'', his autobiography, is about everyday life at the time when British influence was spreading.  Female Malay writers began becoming popular in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="Marshall"/&gt;

Different ethnic and linguistic groups have produced works in their own languages.&lt;ref name="Marshall"/&gt; Chinese and Indian literature became common as the numbers of speakers increased in Malaysia, and locally produced works based in languages from those areas began to be produced in the 19th&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaMy"/&gt; Beginning in the 1950s, Chinese literature expanded; homemade literature in Indian languages has failed to emerge.

==Holidays==
{{Main article|Public holidays in Malaysia}}
[[File:HariRayaMalaykids.jpg|thumb|alt=A Malay girl and two Malay boys dressed in green traditional clothing|Malay children dressed for [[Eid ul-Fitr|Hari raya]]]]
Malaysians observe a number of holidays and festivities throughout the year, on both the federal and state level. Other festivals are observed by particular ethnic or religion groups, but are not public holidays. The main holy days of each major religion are public holidays. The most widespread holiday is the "[[Hari Merdeka]]" (Independence Day), otherwise known as "Merdeka" (Freedom), on 31 August. It commemorates the independence of the [[Federation of Malaya]]. This, as well as [[Labour Day]] (1 May), the King's birthday (first Saturday of June), and some other festivals are major national public holidays. Federal Territory day is celebrated in the three Federal territories.&lt;ref name="Marshall"/&gt;  [[Malaysia Day]], held on 16 September, commemorates the formation of Malaysia through the union of [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]], [[Singapore]], [[Sabah]], and [[Sarawak]], although it is celebrated mainly in East Malaysia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/142747 |title=Independence again on Malaysia Day |publisher=Malaysiakini |date=16 September 1963 |accessdate=11 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Year's Day, Chinese New Year, and the start of the Islamic calendar are all public holidays.&lt;ref name="Marshall"/&gt; [[Muslim holidays]] are highly prominent in Malaysia. The most important of these is ''Hari Raya Puasa'' (also called ''Hari Raya Aidilfitri''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://go2travelmalaysia.com/tour_malaysia/hrya_puasa.htm |title=Festival of Malaysia ~ Hari Raya Puasa |publisher=Go2travelmalaysia.com |date=11 September 2010 |accessdate=15 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is the Malay translation of [[Eid al-Fitr]]. It is a festival honoured by Muslims worldwide marking the end of [[Ramadan]], the fasting month. They also celebrate [[Hari Raya Haji]] (also called ''Hari Raya Aidiladha'', the translation of [[Eid ul-Adha]]), Awal Muharram ([[Islamic New Year]]) and [[Mawlid|Maulidur Rasul]] (Birthday of the Prophet).&lt;ref name="Marshall"/&gt;

[[Malaysian Chinese]] typically hold the same festivals observed by Chinese around the world. [[Chinese New Year]] is the most prominent, lasting for 15 days. Hindus in Malaysia celebrate [[Deepavali]], the festival of light,&lt;ref name="Marshall"/&gt; while [[Thaipusam]] is a celebration in which pilgrims from all over the country meet at the [[Batu Caves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://go2travelmalaysia.com/tour_malaysia/thaipusam.htm |title=Festivals of Malaysia ~ Thaipusam Festival |publisher=Go2travelmalaysia.com |date= |accessdate=15 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vesak|Wesak]] (Malay for Vesak), the day of Buddha's birth, is a public holiday. Malaysia's Christian community observes most of the holidays observed by Christians elsewhere, most notably Christmas&lt;ref name="Marshall"/&gt; and Easter. Good Friday, however, is only a public holiday in the two Bornean states. The harvest festivals of [[Gawai Dayak|Gawai]] in Sarawak and [[Kaamatan]] in Sabah are also important for East Malaysians.&lt;ref name="goto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://go2travelmalaysia.com/tour_malaysia/holidays.htm |title=Malaysia&amp;nbsp;— Holidays |publisher=Go2travelmalaysia.com |date= |accessdate=15 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite most of the festivals being identified with a particular ethnic or religious group, festivities are often participated in by all Malaysians. One example of this is the celebration of ''Kongsi Raya'', which is celebrated when Hari Raya Puasa and Chinese New Year coincide. The term ''Kongsi Raya'' (which means "sharing the celebration" in [[Malay language|Malay]]) was coined because of the similarity between the word ''kongsi'' and the Chinese New Year greeting of ''Gong xi fa cai''. Similarly, the portmanteau ''Deepa Raya'' was coined when Hari Raya Puasa and Deepavali coincided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.melta.org.my/ET/2007/2007.pdf#page=9 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516014935/http://www.melta.org.my/ET/2007/2007.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=16 May 2011 |title=The English Teacher|publisher=Malaysian English Language Teaching Association|date=2 May 2008|accessdate=15 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A practice known as "open house" (''rumah terbuka'') is common during the festivities, especially during Hari Raya Aidilfitri, Deepavali, Chinese New Year, and Christmas. Open house means that all well-wishers are received and that everyone, regardless of background, is invited to attend.&lt;ref name="matic1"/&gt; Open houses are normally held at the home of the host and foods are prepared by the host. There are also open houses held at larger public venues, especially when hosted by government agencies or corporations. Most Malaysians take the time off work or school to return to their hometowns to celebrate the festivities with their extended relatives. This practice is commonly known as ''balik kampung'' and usually causes traffic jams on most highways in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|publisher=New Straits Times|date=7 September 2010|accessdate=18 November 2010|title=Ripple effect of the festive rush|url=http://www.nst.com.my/nst/articles/17billion/Article/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100914123615/http://www.nst.com.my/nst/articles/17billion/Article|archivedate=14 September 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cinema===
{{Main article|Cinema of Malaysia}}
Malaysian filming has gone through five stages. The first stage occurred when narrative filmmaking began in 1933, with the production of [[Laila Majnun]] by a company operating out of Singapore. For the first couple of decades following [[World War II]], most films were directed by directors from [[India]] and the [[Philippines]], which produced a second stage of movies. The first locally directed film, [[Permata di-Perlembahan]], was produced in 1952. It however failed in the cinemas. A third stage appeared as Singapore-based studios began to produce films in the 1950s, but the industry was subsequently damaged due to independence of Singapore and the loss of studios there. Indonesian films gained popularity at this time, although a small group of filmmakers continued to produce in Malaysia, forming the fourth stage. In the 1980s the local industry began to recover, bringing about the fifth and most eloquent stage, which covered more themes than any previous stage. This was also the first time non-Malay films began to have a significant presence.&lt;ref name="Voices"&gt;{{cite web|author=Hassan Muthalib |url=http://criticine.com/feature_article.php?id=17 |title=Voices of Malaysian Cinema |publisher=Criticine |date=13 October 2005 |accessdate=5 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government began to sponsor films in 1975, creating the [[National Film Development Corporation Malaysia|National Film Development Corporation]] in 1981.&lt;ref name="Voices"/&gt; Through this the government offers loans to filmmaker's who want to develop films, however the criteria for obtaining funds has been criticised as promoting only commercial films. Due to this lack of government funding for smaller projects, a strong independent film movement has developed. There has been a large increase in short films, which in the past two decades have begun to gain status in international film festivals. Independent documentaries often cover areas which would normally be censored by the government, such as sex and sexuality, as well as racial inequality and tension. Although the government has criticised some films for not showing multiculturalism, its actions have been inconsistent in that respect, and often favour the Malay culture over others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Khoo Gaik Cheng |url=http://criticine.com/feature_article.php?id=20 |title=Art, Entertainment and Politics |publisher=Criticine |date=14 October 2005 |accessdate=5 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Euganei''' (fr. [[Latin|Lat.]] ''Euganei'', ''Euganeorum''; cf. [[Greek language|Gr.]] ''εὐγενής'' (eugenēs) 'well-born') were a semi-mythical [[Proto-Italic language|Proto-Italic]] ethnic group that dwelt an area among [[Adriatic Sea]] and [[Rhaetian Alps]]. Subsequently, they were driven by the [[Adriatic Veneti]] to an area between the river [[Adige]] and [[Lake Como]], where they remained until the early [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Micali, ''Storia degli antichi popoli italiani'', Tomo II, Firenze 1832, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

They may have been a [[Neolithic Europe|Pre-Indo-European]] people, ethnically related to the [[Ingauni]], as suggested by the similarity of the names. According to [[Pliny the Elder]] the [[Stoni]] people from [[Trentino]] were of the same stock as the Euganei.

[[Cato the Elder]], in the lost book of ''Origines'', counted among the major tribes of the Euganeans; the Triumplini of [[Val Trompia]] and the [[Camunni]] of [[Val Camonica]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ibidem'', p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Livy]], they were defeated by the [[Adriatic Veneti]] and the [[Troy|Trojans]]. Their descendants settled west of the [[Adige|Athesis (Adige)]] river, around the lakes Sebinus, Edrus and Benacus, where they occupied 34 towns, which were admitted by [[Augustus]] to the [[Latin Rights|rights]] of [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latin]] municipalities.

'''''Furi''''' is an [[Action game|action]] [[shoot 'em up]] video game developed and published by indie studio [[The Game Bakers]] available for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]], and [[Nintendo Switch]]. The game takes place on a planet in a colorful, retro, science fiction setting.

==Gameplay==
''Furi'' is a fast-paced [[action game]] with [[hack and slash]], twin-stick [[shoot 'em up]], and "bullet hell" elements, consisting entirely of [[boss fight]]s. Gameplay consists mostly of dodging bullets, parrying attacks, attacking the bosses by melee or shooting, and [[quick time event]]s. The game is set in closed world environments. Much of the game's story progresses through these interactions, along with animated [[cutscene]]s occurring before and after a boss fight.

==Plot==
A mysterious man spends his existence receiving endless torture within a highly advanced prison, composed of ten islands floating in orbit above a planet's surface. At the beginning of the game, an enigmatic man wearing a rabbit disguise who is known as The Voice frees the Stranger, gives him a sword and gun, and encourages him to fight for his freedom.

The Stranger must navigate each area, wherein dwells a single powerful guardian who exists only to prevent him from escaping: The Chain, a sadistic staff-wielding jailor who tortured the Stranger; The Strap, a prisoner armed with a laser cannon on her head driven mad from her imprisonment; The Line, a wise old man who wields a sword longer than his body and can manipulate time; The Scale, a vengeful diver armed with twin harpoons; The Hand, a noble knight who was responsible for imprisoning the Stranger in the first place; The Song, an angelic woman armed with twin crossbows who conceived the prison; The Burst, a sniper and master tactician; The Edge, an oar-wielding warrior who dedicated his life to fighting The Stranger; and The Beat, a young woman who strives to guard the final door.

As the journey goes on, more about the reasons for imprisoning the Stranger surface, and the Voice reveals that he was the architect who created the prison to protect the planet from the Stranger, but he could not stand being locked in it, and freed the Stranger to be able to escape with him so that he could see his daughter again. Upon reaching the planet's surface, the Stranger finds that his mere presence destroys all physical structures on the planet, including living things. Later exploring the planet more, the Stranger ventures into a structure which holds an attachable device he uses to fly off the planet and into space to meet The Star, the mothership who created him, and many other clones like him. She calls him Rider.

The game contains two normal endings and a secret ending. When facing The Star, Rider can decide to either assimilate the planet or refuse to obey the mothership, thus prompting the tenth and final boss fight against The Star. By assimilating the planet, Rider allows The Star to send out an army of other warriors like him to invade the planet. By refusing to obey the mothership and canceling the invasion, Rider battles and destroys The Star, preventing the planet from being invaded. The secret ending can occur by accepting The Song's offer to stay in her sanctuary-like section of the prison, where she will provide for The Rider. She claims that this will make her the hero of all her people.

The "One More Fight" DLC provides an additional boss, a cyborg called The Flame who challenges the Stranger in an arena beneath the structure holding the Stranger's flying rig. Like The Scale, he seeks vengeance on the Stranger for what happened to his world. If the player defeats The Flame and all other bosses on the highest difficulty setting, they will unlock the hardest fight in the game: a basically modeled figure known as Bernard who fights using an amalgamation of the other bosses' attacks.

'''''Gas-s-s-s''''' (also known as '''''Gas! or It Became Necessary to Destroy the World in Order to Save It''''') is a 1970 [[motion picture]] produced and released by [[American International Pictures]]. 

It was [[movie producer|producer]] [[Roger Corman]]'s final film for AIP, after a long association. He was unhappy because AIP made several cuts to the film without his approval, including removing the final shot where God commented on the action — a shot Corman regarded as one of the greatest he had made in his life.&lt;ref name="hundred movies"&gt;Roger Corman &amp; Jim Jerome, ''How I Made a Hundred Movies in Hollywood and Never lost a Dime'', Muller, 1990 p 166&lt;/ref&gt;

The movie is a [[post-apocalyptic]] [[dark comedy]], about survivors of an accidental military [[gas leak]], of an experimental agent that kills everyone on Earth over the age of 25. (A cartoon [[title sequence]] shows a [[John Wayne]]-esque [[Army General]] announcing&amp;nbsp;— and denouncing&amp;nbsp;— the "accident"; the story picks up after the victims have died.)

The lead characters, Coel and Cilla, were played by [[Robert Corff]] and [[Elaine Giftos]], and the cast features [[Ben Vereen]], [[Cindy Williams]], [[Bud Cort]] and [[Talia Shire]] (credited as "Tally Coppola") in early roles. [[Country Joe McDonald]] makes an appearance, as spokesman "AM Radio".

==Plot==
In [[Dallas]], at the [[Southern Methodist University]], news comes in about a gas which has escaped from a military facility. It starts killing everyone over 25.

Hippie Coel meets and falls in love with Cilla. They discover a [[Gestapo]]-like police force will be running Dallas and flee into the country.

Their car is stolen by some cowboys. They then meet music fan Marissa, her boyfriend Carlos, Hooper and his girlfriend Coralee. Marissa leaves Carlos, who finds a new girlfriend.

The group meet [[Edgar Allan Poe]] who drives around on a motorbike with a girl on the back. They then have an encounter with some bikers who play golf, after which they attend a dance and concert where AM Radio is performing and passing on messages from God. Coel sleeps with Zoe, but Cilla is not jealous.

Coel, Cilla and their friends arrive at a peaceful commune where it seems mankind can start fresh. Then a football team attacks them.

Eventually [[God]] intervenes. Coel and Cilla are reunited with all their friends and there is a big party where everyone gets along.

==Production==
George Armitage had met Roger Corman at 20th Century Fox when the latter was making ''[[The St. Valentine's Day Massacre (film)|The St Valentine's Day Massacre]]''. Armitage later recalled he wrote a script — "it was called either ''Carrot Butts'' or ''A Christmas Carrot'' — which had animated cartoon characters, [[Bugs Bunny]] and so on, coming to life. It was about the studio systems and all this stuff."&lt;ref name="george"/&gt; His agent gave the script to [[Gene Corman|Gene [Corman, Roger's brother]]], who gave it to Roger, "and he loved it, so they submitted it to UA ([[United Artists]]) where they had a deal—[[Mike Medavoy]] was just taking over there and he was younger than I was. From there, Roger said: "Well, that didn't work, why don't we try something else?" Usually he has a title or something and he'll say: "Go ahead, write something, just keep the title.""&lt;ref name="george"/&gt;

''Gas-s-s-s'' was an idea of Corman's, about a world where everybody over thirty had died. Corman later said "my first thought was to do a science fiction film with allegorical overtones."&lt;ref name="sight"&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Ma Barker to von Richthofen: an interview with Roger Corman|last=Strick|first= Philip|magazine=Sight and Sound|edition=39.4|date= Fall 1970|page= 182}}&lt;/ref&gt; Armitage remembers the concept just being "a sentence, and that's what we went with ... He let you make it your own, and I did."&lt;ref name="george"/&gt;

Corman said that although "there was some good work in" Armitage's first draft, "the points I was trying to make in the script either did not come through or came through too obviously different parts, and it became less science fiction and more and more a direct liberal left wing statement picture. I didn't want to be quite that obvious about what I was doing. So I then decided to switch to a comedy, thinking back to ''[[A Bucket of Blood|Bucket of Blood]]'' and ''[[The Little Shop of Horrors|Little Shop of Horrors]]''."&lt;ref name="sight"/&gt;

[[United Artists]] had financed the script but Corman says they felt it was too risky to finance, as they believed it needed a budget of two million dollars. Corman bought the script back off them and decided to finance the film himself, at around $300,000.&lt;ref name="sight"/&gt;

Corman says filming commenced using a first draft, which was rewritten constantly throughout the shoot.&lt;ref name="hundred movies"/&gt;

===Shooting===
Armitage recalls, "We went back in '69 to shoot in New Mexico and Texas. I was the associate producer as well, and we were writing it as we went—which is something that Roger liked to do.&lt;ref name="george"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmcomment.com/blog/interview-george-armitage/|title=George Armitage|website=Film Comment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Winter was coming and I wanted to do the film," said Corman. "I was going to be shooting in New Mexico. I actually shot in December and to wait one more month would have put me in January and I could not have made the film. To wait till next summer would have dated the material I was dealing with, so I wanted to bring the film out early."&lt;ref name="comment"/&gt;

"It was a very inexpensive film," said Corman. "It was shot with a skeleton crew, with a cast of almost entirely amateur actors. Only the leads were professionals."&lt;ref name="comment"&gt;Goldman, C. (1971). An interview with ROGER CORMAN. Film Comment, 7(3), 49-54. Retrieved from https://search.proquest.com/docview/210229038&lt;/ref&gt;

Shooting took around four weeks. Corman sold the movie to [[American International Pictures]] for the negative cost.&lt;ref name="sight"/&gt;

The film features a tribute to [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. Corman says "It was actually a second thought when we put Poe in it. We just started putting things in. In the original concept, he wasn't in it. And we just decided to put him in on a motorcycle—it seemed appropriate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nasr|first= Constantine|title= Roger Corman: Interviews (Conversations with Filmmakers Series)|page=77|publisher=University Press of Mississippi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"There was some sense of disorganization and experimentation as we went along," says Corman.&lt;ref name="comment"/&gt;
 
Corman says the film showed 

&lt;blockquote&gt;that I was beginning to get a little disillusioned" with the youth culture of the time. "I intended that the picture be sympathetic toward our lead gang of kids yet, at the same time, I wanted to show that I was beginning to suspect that all of the ideas being spouted by the counter-culture and all of the dreams were not totally rooted in reality. In the picture, I wanted to literally give youth the world they desired and, then, make a cautionary statement about how youth might not be able to handle it as perfectly as they anticipated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nasr|first= Constantine|title= Roger Corman: Interviews (Conversations with Filmmakers Series)|page=132|publisher=University Press of Mississippi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Corman said there were themes in the film "which go back through all my previous pictures, such as the theme of the destruction of the world which I've played with to a certain extent, and there are some certain political and religious overtones I've dealt with before but I've never put them all together like this. The film became something I firmly believe in."&lt;ref name="sight"/&gt;

He added in 1971 that the film was 

&lt;blockquote&gt;an attempt to look at certain aspects of the youth movement and an attempt to move to a better way of life. I end there with something 1 probably believe, which is that there is a struggle and that it is possible to overcome but not necessarily probable. It's not like some of the youth films that have come out in the last couple of years that have been an unquestioning acceptance of all the values of the youth culture. I've just been around too long to accept anything unquestioningly. This would be a kind of questioning acceptance of many of the values but not all of this culture. For that reason I'm not certain ''gasss'' will be a success ... Also the film is a little flawed in some areas.&lt;ref name="comment"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Editing disagreements==
Roger Corman was angry about what AIP did to the film. He later wrote:

{{quote|I ended the film with a spectacular shot from on top of the mesa, with a view sixty, seventy miles to the horizon ... God, who was a running character throughout the film, made his final comments on what went on ... There must have been three hundred people on top of that mesa. It was one of the greatest shots I ever achieved in my life. And AIP cut out the entire shot. They ended the picture on the couple's cliched kiss - because they didn't like what God was saying. The picture ended and made no sense ... Final cut approval had never been put in writing at AIP. It was more a tacit agreement ... AIP had grown into the biggest independent in the U.S. It was now a publicly held company. The more irreverent the film, the greater the financial risk ... [[James H. Nicholson|Jim [Nicholson]]] had grown conservative and it was his objections to my work that led to the cuts. Jim had done this on four films in a row. [Gas-s-s-s was] the one that really did it for me.&lt;ref name="hundred movies" /&gt;}}

Corman elaborated, saying he had God 

&lt;blockquote&gt;played by an actor with an outrageous New York Jewish accent and they were really startled by that. But cutting God really took the heart out of the picture. I think it was partially the fact that AIP had become a public company and Sam was Jewish and they didn't want to be accused of being anti-Semitic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nasr|first= Constantine|title= Roger Corman: Interviews (Conversations with Filmmakers Series)|pages=198–199|publisher= University Press of Mississippi.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Samuel Z. Arkoff of AIP recalled it differently:

{{quote|When Roger left for Europe to shoot ''[[Von Richthofen and Brown]]'' for [[United Artists]], he turned over the rough cut to us. Jim [Nicholson] and I viewed it, and realized it needed substantial work. We so informed Roger, who didn't disagree ... Roger's handpicked editors eliminated lines, entire scenes, and even one of the leading characters in the film. They also cut out a final shot that Roger adored, in which he positioned the leading man, his lady, and three hundred extras on a mesa ... The camera panned back while the words of God were heard in a voice-over. For some reason, the voice of God had an accent. Roger thought it was one of the most spectacular shots of his film career. The editors thought it belonged on the cutting room floor, which was right where they left it ... We had tried, but the editors just couldn't save the picture.&lt;ref name="sam"&gt;Samuel Z Arkoff, ''Flying Through Hollywood by the Seat of My Pants''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Reception==
Corman says the film opened and the [[Edinburgh Film Festival]] and he "got a cable from the organizers of the festival saying, "''gasss'' explodes. Five minutes standing ovation." I thought, "Boy, I've really got one."&lt;ref name="comment"/&gt;

The film premiered in New York as part of a retrospective on Roger Corman's work.&lt;ref&gt;Film Retrospective to Honor Kazan
By A. H. WEILER. New York Times (1923-Current file) [New York, N.Y] 27 Jan 1971: 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971 Corman stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;AIP hates the picture. They dislike it intensely and they would not give it a New York opening. Since it's a very inexpensive picture, they've been playing it around the country in drive-ins and small towns where it's been doing only moderate business. The projection is that it will break even and possibly make a tiny profit. They don't want to spend the money to open in New York because it's very expensive to open right in New York. They feel it will not do well here and will turn a possibly slight loser into a slight failure. Because of the retrospective we have an essentially free opening here. However, I'm not quite as optimistic about the picture as I was after the news of the Edinburgh Festival. The fact that its been playing around to only moderate audiences may indicate some weaknesses in the film. On the other hand, it could mean that it's been playing to the wrong audiences.&lt;ref name="comment"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to [[Samuel Z. Arkoff]], "when ''Gas-s-s-s'' was released, it was promoted with ads that proclaimed, 'Invite a few friends over to watch the end of the world.' The picture didn't make any money."&lt;ref name="sam"/&gt;

Corman later reflected:

&lt;blockquote&gt;One of the great problems is that the film is far too intellectual. Other people have told me that they think it's a meaningless film. They may well be both right. It is the most intricate and the most organized intellectual film that I have ever made. I was so careful to keep each concept deep behind a humorous look at it. I didn't want at any time to allow the preachings of what I was saying to come across too heavily and disturb the flow of the picture and its humor. In my desire to keep it in the background, I may have kept it so far in the background that I'm the only person who is going to know what is in every scene.&lt;ref name="comment"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was the last film Corman directed for AIP, and he only made one more movie before a twenty-year sabbatical. "

&lt;blockquote&gt;A great deal of care went into what I was saying and how I was going to say it," he said of ''Gas-s-s-s''. "The finished picture does not evidently make all these points. It discourages me and so for a little while I prefer to step away ... Directing is very hard and very painful. Producing is easy. I can do it without really thinking about it.&lt;ref name="comment"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Corman did, however, go on to produce ''[[Boxcar Bertha]]'' for AIP.

''Gas-s-s-s'' found a fresh airing on [[late night television]] in the 1980s. In 2005 it was issued on [[DVD]], as a [[double feature]] with ''[[Wild in the Streets]]'', another AIP movie.

==Apocalyptic Beast==
(Annotation)
The whole series of [[minimalist]] novels written over the course of 6 years (between 1993–1998) based on the experiment started by the author while studying in Germany, which later continued in Georgia. The cycle of parody texts began with the first novel the 9th Symphony. The prototypes were the author’s friends, Georgians living with him in a small cottage in one of the German villages. While searching for new forms to express his ideas, the author had started an unintentional linguistic experiment – personal feelings and concrete stories connected with friends were developed by mixing them with the author’s favorite literary characters and plots. Notably, these were times when the author practically did not have any information on postmodernist literature.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="941">'''''Herr Pastor''''' is a stereotypical [[authoritarian]] [[pastor]] in an [[Ethnic German]] congregation. ''Herr Pastor'', literally "Mister Pastor" in German, was a title often used even in English-speaking congregations with [[Germany|German]] heritage, such as [[Lutheran]] or [[Evangelical and Reformed Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pastoral Concerns|url=http://www.leaderu.com/ftissues/ft9711/opinion/nuechterlein.html|website=www.leaderu.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The leadership style of the ''Herr Pastor'' was, to some degree, a [[benevolent dictatorship]] in the sense that the ''Herr Pastor'' held supreme decision-making authority. Depictions of the ''Herr Pastor'' often characterise him as humorless.

'''Julia Child's kitchen''' is a historic artifact on display on the ground floor of the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Museum of American History]]: Kenneth E. Behring Center, located in [[Washington, D.C.]], on the [[National Mall]]. The kitchen is not a replica, but is the actual [[kitchen]] used by noted 20th-century [[cookbook]] author and [[cooking show]] host [[Julia Child]], appearing as the backdrop to several of her [[television show]]s.

==History==
Built in Child's home on Irving Street in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts]] in 1961, the kitchen was designed by her husband, [[Paul Cushing Child]] with 38-inch high countertops, rather than the standard 36-inch height, for her 6-foot-2-inch frame.&lt;ref name="Domenica Marchetti"&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/12/AR2009081201187.html| title=In Julia Child's Kitchen, A Lifetime of Stories| author= Domenica Marchetti| work= The Washington Post | date= August 13, 2009| accessdate=Aug 21, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul also selected the light blue-green color scheme dominating the kitchen's [[wall panel|panel]]s.

It was the setting for three of her television shows: ''[[In Julia's Kitchen with Master Chefs]]'', ''[[Baking With Julia]],'' and ''[[Julia and Jacques Cooking at Home]]'' with [[Jacques Pépin]]. The kitchen was fully transformed into a functional [[Set construction|set]], with TV-quality lighting, three cameras positioned to catch all angles in the room, and a massive center island with a gas stovetop on one side and an electric stovetop on the other, but leaving the rest of the Childs' appliances alone, including the "wall oven with its squeaking door."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=In Julia's Kitchen with Master Chefs |last=Child |first=Julia |year=1995 |publisher=Knopf |isbn=0-679-43896-3 |chapter=Acknowledgments}}&lt;/ref&gt; During taping, the kitchen table and chairs were removed and replaced by a cooking island that had a built-in stovetop and food preparation surfaces.&lt;ref name=SIFAQ&gt;[http://americanhistory.si.edu/juliachild/jck/html/faqs.asp Julia Child's Kitchen at the Smithsonion Institution], FAQ.&lt;/ref&gt; This kitchen backdrop hosted nearly all of Child's 1990s television series.

In August 2001, representatives of the Smithsonian Institution met with Child in her home, where she agreed to donate her kitchen to the Institution,&lt;ref name=SIFAQ/&gt; where it is now on display. Shortly after Child's 90th birthday, on August 18 and 19, 2002, Child attended the opening of the display of her kitchen.&lt;ref name=SIFAQ/&gt; Her iconic copper pots and pans were on display at [[Copia (museum)|Copia]] in [[Napa, California]], until August 2009 when they were reunited with her kitchen at the National Museum of American History.&lt;ref name="Domenica Marchetti"/&gt;

*[[Legal history]]

==By ideological classification (historiography)==
Although there is arguably some intrinsic [[bias]] in history studies (with [[nationalism|national]] bias perhaps being the most significant), history can also be studied from [[ideology|ideological]] perspectives, which practitioners feel are often ignored, such as:
*[[Marxist historiography]]
*[[Feminist history]] (also called ''herstory'').

A form of historical speculation known commonly as [[counterfactual history]] has also been adopted by some historians as a means of assessing and exploring the possible outcomes if certain events had not occurred or had occurred in a different way. This is somewhat similar to the [[Alternate history (fiction)|alternate history]] genre in fiction.

Lists of false or dubious historical resources and [[historical myths]] that were once popular and widespread, or have become so, have also been prepared.

The city of [[Rome]] harbours the most [[obelisk]]s in the world. There are eight [[ancient Egypt]]ian and five [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] '''obelisks in Rome''', together with a number of more modern obelisks; there was also until 2005 an [[Kingdom of Aksum|ancient Ethiopian]] obelisk in Rome.

The Romans used special heavy cargo carriers called [[obelisk ships]] to transport the monuments down the [[Nile]] to [[Alexandria]] and from there across the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to Rome. On site, large [[Crane (machine)#History|Roman cranes]] were employed to erect the [[monolith]]s.

== Ancient Egyptian obelisks ==
At least eight obelisks created in antiquity by the Egyptians were taken from Egypt after the [[Roman conquest of Egypt|Roman conquest]] and brought to Rome.

==Final days and assassination==
[[File:Marielle Vitória.png|thumb|right|Demonstration held in [[Greater Vitória|Vitória]] to honor the memory of Marielle Franco and Anderson Pedro Gomes.]]

On 13 March 2018, Franco spoke out on [[Twitter]] against the police violence in Rio de Janeiro: “Another homicide of a young man that could be credited to the police. Matheus Melo was leaving church when he was killed. How many others will have to die for this war to end?”&lt;ref name="protests held"/&gt; ({{lang-pt|Mais um homicídio de um jovem que pode estar entrando para a conta da PM. Matheus Melo estava saindo da igreja. Quantos mais vão precisar morrer para que essa guerra acabe?}}&lt;ref name="Franco_2018-03-13_Twitter" /&gt;)

The next day, Franco attended a round-table discussion titled "Black Youngsters Moving [Power] Structures" ({{lang-pt|Jovens Negras Movendo Estruturas}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/portuguese/brasil-43424088|title=Marielle era uma das 32 mulheres negras entre 811 vereadores eleitos em capitais brasileiras|last=Gragnani|first=Juliana|date=15 March 2018|website=BBC|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less than two hours after leaving the round-table, she and her driver, Anderson Pedro Gomes, were fatally shot by two men who were driving another car. The men fired nine shots at them, four of which struck Franco – three in the head and one in the neck.&lt;ref name=direcao&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brasil.estadao.com.br/noticias/rio-de-janeiro,direcao-dos-tiros-contra-marielle-reforca-hipotese-de-ataque-premeditado,70002229183|title=Direção dos tiros contra Marielle reforça hipótese de ataque premeditado|author=Roberta Jansen, Marcio Dolzan e Fabio Grellet|date=15 March 2018|website=Estadão|accessdate=2018-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Franco's press officer was next to her in the back seat and survived with injuries.&lt;ref name="protests held"/&gt;&lt;ref name=direcao/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/15/marielle-franco-shot-dead-targeted-killing-rio|title=Marielle Franco, councillor and police critic, shot dead in targeted killing in Rio|last=Associated Press|date=2018-03-15|website=The Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcelo Freixo, a Rio de Janeiro legislative assembly member from [[Socialism and Liberty Party|PSOL]] who came to the scene shortly after hearing of her killing, determined that the bullets had been directed at her in a clear execution. According to the Rio de Janeiro police, the direction of the nine shots supports the hypothesis that Franco was assassinated.&lt;ref name=direcao/&gt; The bullets that killed Franco are from a batch bought by the [[Federal Police of Brazil|federal police]] in [[Brasília]] in 2006;&lt;ref name="guardian317"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/18/marielle-franco-brazil-favelas-mourn-death-champion|title=Marielle Franco: Brazil’s favelas mourn the death of a champion|last=Phillips|first=Dom|date=17 March 2018|website=The Guardian|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mintpressnews.com/suspicious-murder-of-anti-police-brutality-activist-sparks-large-protests-in-brazil/239023/|title=Suspicious Murder of Anti-Police Brutality Activist Sparks Large Protests In Brazil|last=Canofre|first=Fernanda|date=16 March 2018|website=Mint Press News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minister of Public Security [[Raul Jungmann]] later said that they were stolen from a post office storage facility in [[Paraíba]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://riotimesonline.com/brazil-news/rio-politics/ammunition-which-killed-rio-lawmaker-stolen-from-police/|title=Ammunition Which Killed Marielle Franco in Rio Stolen from Police|author=Lise Alves|date=17 March 2018|publisher=The Rio Times|accessdate=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the ministry subsequently retracted this explanation after the Post Office publicly denied it.&lt;ref name="Adorno 2018"&gt;{{cite web | last=Adorno | first=s | title=Ministério muda versão de Jungmann sobre roubo de munição usada em assassinato de Marielle | website=Cotidiano | date=Mar 19, 2018 | url=https://noticias.uol.com.br/cotidiano/ultimas-noticias/2018/03/19/jungmann-recua-sobre-roubo-de-municao-usada-em-assassinato-de-marielle.htm | language=pt | access-date=Mar 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Modern [[rhetoric]]''' has gone through many changes since the age of ancient Rome and Greece to fit the societal demands of the time.  [[Kenneth Burke]], who is largely credited for defining the notion of modern rhetoric, described modern rhetoric as, "Rooted in an essential function of language itself, a function that is wholly realistic, and is continually born anew; the use of language as a symbolic means of inducing cooperation in beings that by nature respond to symbols."&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth. A Rhetoric of Motives. London, England: University of California Press, Ltd, 1950. Print. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;   Burke’s theory of rhetoric directed attention to the division between classical and modern rhetoric.  The intervention of outside academic movements, such as structuralism, semiotics, and critical theory, made important contributions to a modern sense of rhetorical studies.

==Support and criticism==
Some critics disagree with a changing definition of rhetoric, including [[Brian Vickers]], who argued that modern rhetoric demeans classical rhetoric: "It first reduces its scope, and then applies it to purposes that it never dreamt of."&lt;ref&gt;Vickers, Brian. "The Atrophy of Modern Rhetoric, Vico to De Man." Rhetorica 6.1 (1988): 21-56. Web. 15 February 2010. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;   He also critiques Burke’s writing on modern rhetoric, saying it is, "A [rhetorical] system that rearranges the components of classical rhetoric so idiosyncratically as to be virtually unusable."&lt;ref&gt;Vickers 28.&lt;/ref&gt;
	Kenneth Burke was heavily influenced by modern social stratification and the way which symbols allow social unification and polarization, particularly in A Rhetoric of Motives.&lt;ref&gt;Abbott, Don. "Marxist Influences on the Rhetorical Theory of Kenneth Burke." Philosophy &amp; Rhetoric 7.4 (1974): 217-233. Web. 9 April 2010. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;   Burke sees these social changes as a social drama, acted out in rhetorical performance.  Burke also employs Freudian principles in his works on modern rhetoric. He highlights the importance of modern psychology, where identification of the audience plays a key role.  The principle of identification, as Burke explains, is the speaker appealing to the audience’s opinions and ideals.&lt;ref&gt;Burke. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;   Identification is crucial for modern rhetorical study and the principal of [[constitutive rhetoric]].

==Other influences==
A significant event, deemed the "[[linguistic turn]]," drastically changed how modern rhetoric was theorized and practiced.  The linguistic turn linked different areas of study by their common concern for symbol-systems in shaping the way humans interpret the world and create meaning.  Interpreting the world and creating meaning is the basis for Richard E. Vatz's "Myth of the Rhetorical Situation," Philosophy and Rhetoric, Summer: 1973 and The Only Authentic Book of Persuasion, Kendall Hunt, 2012, 2013.  This is a change from the traditional understanding of words being labels for ideas and concepts, to the notion of language constituting social reality.

The [[public sphere]] was studied by scholars such as [[Jürgen Habermas]] and [[Gerard A. Hauser]].  Jürgen Habermas described the public sphere as the sphere of private people coming together as a public that is accessible by all, to openly discuss the general rules governing society.&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, Jürgen. The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere: An Inquiry into a Category of Bourgeois Society. 2nd ed. The MIT Press, 1991. Print. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;   Gerard Hauser described the public sphere differently in terms of rhetoric.  Hauser explained it to be formed by the dialogue surrounding issues, emphasizing how the members of society that engage in the dialogue were the components of the public sphere.&lt;ref&gt;Hauser, Gerald. Vernacular Dialogue and the Rhetoricality of Public Opinion. Communication Monographs, 1998. Print. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;   The public sphere grows by attaining more members who will engage in the vernacular.  Hauser’s definition of the rhetorical public sphere still shares the notion of open debate and accessibility, assuming that the participants are actively engaged in the discourse.

==Conclusion==
Some scholars that support the notion of modern rhetoric offer normative models that differ from classical rhetoric.  Modern rhetorical study, some say, should stress two-way communication based on mutual trust and understanding to improve the speaker’s ability to persuade.&lt;ref&gt;Ede, Lisa, and [[Andrea Lunsford]]. "On Distinctions Between Classical and Modern Rhetoric." Educational Resources Information Center (1982): 1-29. Web. 17 February 2010. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;   Acknowledging that all communication and symbols are rhetorical, scholars of the field also call for a continued expansion of the objects of study, in order to improve communicative practices and bring about more egalitarian speech.

'''''Numbers''''' (stylized as '''''NUMB3RS''''')  is an American [[crime drama]] [[television series]] that ran on [[CBS]] from January 23, 2005, to March 12, 2010. The series was created by [[Nicolas Falacci]] and [[Cheryl Heuton]], and follows [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI Special Agent]] [[Don Eppes]] ([[Rob Morrow]]) and his brother [[Charlie Eppes]] ([[David Krumholtz]]), a college mathematics professor and prodigy who helps Don solve crimes for the FBI. Brothers [[Ridley Scott|Ridley]] and [[Tony Scott]] produced ''Numbers''; its production companies are the Scott brothers' [[Scott Free Productions]] and [[CBS Television Studios]] (originally [[Paramount Network Television]], and later [[CBS Paramount Network Television]]).

The show focuses equally on the relationships among Don Eppes, his brother Charlie Eppes, and their father, [[Alan Eppes]] ([[Judd Hirsch]]), and on the brothers' efforts to fight crime, normally in Los Angeles. A typical episode begins with a crime, which is subsequently investigated by a team of FBI agents led by Don and [[Mathematical modeling|mathematically modeled]] by Charlie, with the help of [[Larry Fleinhardt]] ([[Peter MacNicol]]) and [[Amita Ramanujan]] ([[Navi Rawat]]). The insights provided by Charlie's mathematics were always in some way crucial to solving the crime.

On May 18, 2010, CBS announced that ''Numbers'' had been canceled after six seasons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2010/05/report-cbs-cancels-ghost-whisperer-numbers-and-five-more-shows.html "Report: CBS cancels 'Ghost Whisperer,' 'Numbers' and five more shows"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101111044100/http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2010/05/report-cbs-cancels-ghost-whisperer-numbers-and-five-more-shows.html |date=2010-11-11 }}. [[Zap2It]] May 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cast and characters==
{{Main|List of Numbers characters}}
The show revolved around three intersecting groups of characters: the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], scientists at the fictitious California Institute of Science (CalSci), and the Eppes family.

* [[Don Eppes]] ([[Rob Morrow]]), Charlie's older brother, is the lead [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI agent]] at the Los Angeles Violent Crimes Squad.
* [[Professor|Prof.]] [[Charlie Eppes]] ([[David Krumholtz]]) is a [[mathematician|mathematical genius]] who, in addition to teaching at CalSci, consults for the FBI and [[National Security Agency|NSA]].
* [[Alan Eppes]] ([[Judd Hirsch]]) is a former [[Los Angeles|L.A.]] [[Urban planner|city planner]], a widower, and the father of both Charlie and Don Eppes. Alan lives in a historic two-story house (filmed at [https://www.google.com/maps/place/2515+4th+Ave,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90018/@34.034002,-118.3238247,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x80c2b869ec3fde99:0x627e93a3a95a80da 2525 4th Avenue]) furnished with period [[Arts and Crafts Movement|Arts and Crafts]] furniture.
* [[David Sinclair (Numbers)|David Sinclair]] ([[Alimi Ballard]]) is an FBI [[field agent]] and was later made Don's second-in-command and promoted to supervisor.
* Terry Lake ([[Sabrina Lloyd]]) is a forensic psychologist and FBI agent.
* Prof. [[Larry Fleinhardt]] ([[Peter MacNicol]]) is a [[theoretical physicist]] and [[cosmologist]] at CalSci. Charlie's former mentor and now best friend, he also frequently consults for the FBI.
* Prof. [[Amita Ramanujan]] ([[Navi Rawat]]) is a mathematician at CalSci and an FBI consultant. In season&amp;nbsp;2, she begins dating Charlie, to whom she is engaged and married in season&amp;nbsp;6. Charlie was her [[thesis advisor]]. Her name is a reference to influential autodidactic Indian mathematician [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]].
* [[Megan Reeves]] ([[Diane Farr]]) is an FBI [[behaviorist|behavioral specialist]]. She was involved romantically with Larry Fleinhardt and left the FBI to counsel troubled young women.
* [[Colby Granger]] ([[Dylan Bruno]]) is an FBI field agent. Once thought to have betrayed his colleagues, he is now back in their good graces and confidence.
* [[Liz Warner]] ([[Aya Sumika]]) is an FBI agent, formerly involved with Agent Eppes.
* [[Nikki Betancourt]] ([[Sophina Brown]]) is an FBI agent with four years' experience in the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] and a [[Juris Doctor|law degree]].

Temporary characters on the show were often named after famous mathematicians. For example, in the episode "[[List of Numbers episodes|In Plain Sight]]" (season&amp;nbsp;2, episode&amp;nbsp;8), one of the criminals is named [[Michel Rolle|Rolle]] and Charlie's father mentions a meeting with a man named [[Julius Petersen|Robert Peterson]].

{{Main|List of Numbers episodes}}

'''Opening:''' (Voice-over by David Krumholtz) We all use math every day. To predict weather…to tell time…to handle money. Math is more than formulas and equations. It’s logic; it’s rationality. It’s using your mind to solve the biggest mysteries we know.

===Season 1 (2005)===
{{Main|List of Numbers episodes (season 1)}}
The first season run of the show aired between January 23, 2005, and May 13, 2005, at 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. on Fridays. It sees the start of the working relationship between Los Angeles' [[List of FBI field offices#California|FBI field office]] and Charlie Eppes. The main FBI agents are Charlie's brother, Don Eppes, and [[List of Numbers characters#Terry Lake|Terry Lake]], as well as [[List of Numbers characters#David Sinclair|David Sinclair]]. Don and Charlie's father, Alan Eppes, provides emotional support for the pair, while Professor Larry Fleinhardt and doctoral student [[Amita Ramanujan]] provide mathematical support and insights to Charlie. Season One was a half-season, producing only 13 episodes. [[Sabrina Lloyd]] played Terry Lake, an agent, in this season; she was later replaced by [[Diane Farr]], who played Megan Reeves.

===Season 2 (2005–06)===
{{Main|List of Numbers episodes (season 2)}}
The second season run of the show aired between September 23, 2005, and May 19, 2006, again at 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. on Fridays. Season Two sees several changes to Don's FBI team: Terry Lake is reassigned to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] and two new members join Don and David Sinclair: [[Megan Reeves (Numb3rs)|Megan Reeves]] and [[Colby Granger]]. Charlie is challenged on one of his long-standing pieces of mathematical work and also starts work on a new theory, Cognitive Emergence Theory. Larry sells his home and assumes a [[nomad]]ic lifestyle, while he becomes romantically involved with Megan. Amita receives an offer for an assistant professor position at [[Harvard University]], but is plagued by doubt as her relationship with Charlie is challenged and her career is in upheaval. Alan begins work and dating again, although he struggles with the loss of his wife, and both he and Charlie dream of her.

===Season 3 (2006–07)===
{{Main|List of Numbers episodes (season 3)}}
''Numb3rs'' was renewed for a third season,&lt;ref name="season3"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tv.com/numb3rs/show/25043/story.html?story_id=3543&amp;tag=headlines;title;1 |title=Voila! CBS renews 14 shows at once |last=Mahan |first=Colin |publisher=TV.com |date=March 6, 2006 |accessdate=August 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; which began airing at 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. on Friday, September 22, 2006, and ended on May 18, 2007. Charlie and Amita intensify their relationship, as do Larry and Megan, especially after Megan's kidnapping. Amita has troubles adjusting in her new role as a CalSci professor, and Larry announces his [[leave of absence]]—he will be on the [[International Space Station]] for six months, which greatly distresses Charlie. Charlie and his colleagues are troubled by Dr. Mildred Finch, the newly appointed Chair of the CalSci Physics, Mathematics, and Astronomy Division, whom they learn has begun dating Alan. Meanwhile, Don dates Agent Liz Warner and questions his [[ethics]] and [[self-worth]], and receives counseling. Charlie sees Don's therapist and the two understand one another more. Despite Don's concerns, Alan engages in some FBI consulting with his knowledge of engineering, and Larry returns from the space station, disillusioned. The finale wraps up with a revelation that Colby was actually a double agent for the Chinese.

Noticeable changes from previous seasons include the removal of the opening credit sequence (credits are now done during the first segment of the show), the absence of Peter MacNicol's character for much of the season, and the absence of Diane Farr's character for a few episodes. Peter MacNicol appeared in the first eleven episodes before leaving for the television show ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'', but returned to ''Numbers'' for the 21st episode of season&amp;nbsp;3 ("[[The Art of Reckoning (Numb3rs)|The Art of Reckoning]]"). His character's absence was written into the show by having him become a [[Payload Specialist]] on the [[International Space Station]]. Diane Farr, pregnant for most of the season, left the show for [[maternity leave]] in episode 18 ("[[Democracy (Numb3rs)|Democracy]]"); her character's absence is explained as a special assignment to the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]].

===Season 4 (2007–08)===
{{Main|List of Numbers episodes (season 4)}}
The season premiere aired on September 28, 2007, in the same time slot as in previous seasons, 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time]].&lt;ref name="fall2007preview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbs.com/primetime/fall_preview_2007/ |title=CBS 2007 Fall Preview |accessdate=August 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the [[2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike|writer's strike]], only 12 episodes were initially produced. However, once the strike ended, CBS announced the show's return April 4, 2008, with six episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zap2it.com/tv/news/zap-cbsreturndates,0,7656374.story |title=CBS Sets Series Return Dates |accessdate=February 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The season ended on May 16, 2008.

As this season starts, [[Colby Granger]] escapes from jail, and is revealed to be a [[triple agent]]. He then rejoins the team. Don and Liz break up halfway through this season, after Liz has trouble with Don's trust issues. Amita's parents come to visit, which becomes a secondary theme throughout most of the season. Due to her work at the D.O.J., Megan is conflicted by her work, and turns to Larry for help. Near the end of the season, Don's girlfriend from season&amp;nbsp;2, Robin Brooks, returns. Don and Robin then continue their relationship. Charlie attends [[FBI Academy|FBI training camp]] because he has been working with Don for several years and wants to better understand what his brother does. In the season finale, Megan leaves the team to move back to [[Washington, D.C.]], and Charlie goes head-to-head with Don about a case. This causes Charlie to send information to scientists in [[Pakistan]]. He is subsequently arrested and has his [[security clearance]] revoked, so he can no longer help Don on cases. At the end of the episode, Don drives away to another case and Charlie admits that giving up FBI work will be harder than he expected.

Several characters from previous seasons did not appear in season&amp;nbsp;4, most notably [[Mildred Finch]] and [[Ian Edgerton]].

===Season 5 (2008–09)===
{{Main|List of Numbers episodes (season 5)}}
The fifth season premiered on October 3, 2008, and the season finale aired on May 15, 2009. The season premiere was moved back one week to accommodate the [[United States presidential election debates, 2008|2008 presidential debates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/114334-CBS_Sets_Fall_Premiere_Dates.php |title=CBS Sets Fall Premiere Dates |publisher=Broadcasting &amp; Media |accessdate=June 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Season five opens three weeks after "[[When Worlds Collide (Numbers)|When Worlds Collide]]" (season four's season finale), with the government dropping the charges against Charlie. Charlie gets his [[security clearance]] back after he and Don fight FBI Security Officer Carl McGowan. Don begins to explore [[Judaism]]. The team adds new agent Nikki Betancourt, who arrives shortly after Megan Reeves' departure. Robin is offered a promotion but turns it down. Buck Winters (from the episodes, [[Spree (Numbers)|"Spree"]] and "[[Two Daughters]]") breaks out of prison and comes after Don. Alan suddenly finds himself coaching CalSci's basketball team. David becomes Don's primary relief supervisor. [[DARPA]] tries to recruit Charlie, but he turns down their offer. Toward the end of the season, Don is stabbed, and Charlie blames himself for it. The aftermath of Don's stabbing causes Charlie to focus more on his FBI consultation work. Amita is kidnapped, and the team races to find her. After she is rescued, Charlie proposes to Amita. Her response is left unidentified.

Notes about Season Five:
[[Disturbed (Numbers)|"Disturbed"]] marked the 100th episode of ''Numbers''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/2009/05/01/2009-05-01_hawking_counts_numb3rs_as_a_fave.html |title=Hawking counts 'Numb3rs' as a fave |accessdate=September 9, 2009 |last=Kinon |first=Cristina |date=May 1, 2009 |publisher=''[[New York Daily News]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Season 6 (2009–10)===
{{Main|List of Numbers episodes (season 6)}}
The sixth and final season premiered Friday, September 25, 2009, at 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/FallTV-CBS-premieres-1007227.aspx |title=Fall TV: CBS Announces Premiere Dates |publisher=TVGuide.com |accessdate=June 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the season finale aired on March 12, 2010, 3 days before Hirsch's 75th birthday.

The season starts with the [[engagement]] of Charlie and Amita. Soon after, Larry turns down an opportunity to meet with mathematicians at [[CERN]], in [[Geneva]], and drops his course load for the following semester. This leads Charlie to realize Larry is once again leaving, and leaving all of his work to Charlie. Don learns that his former mentor is crooked, causing Don angst when he has to shoot his mentor. Charlie and Don learn that Alan has lost a substantial amount of money in his [[401(k)]]. After some delay, Larry leaves [[Los Angeles]], only to find a vacant piece of land for sale within driving distance of the city. Alan decides to return to work and finds a job as a software technical consultant. David asks Don for advice about career paths within the FBI. Larry returns from the desert with a new theory about the universe's fate. Charlie and Amita begin planning their wedding and decide to join the [[Big Brothers Big Sisters of America|Big Brother/Big Sister]] program to practice parenting skills. They get married before their move to [[England]] to teach at the [[University of Cambridge]]. Don loses his gun, recovers it after it is used in some [[vigilante]] murders, and gets engaged to Robin. He also decides to leave the team, taking an administrative position within the FBI. Before leaving, Charlie and Amita decide that the family garage should be converted to a [[guest house]] so Alan can continue living with them. Leaving Colby, Liz, and Nikki behind, David departs for [[Washington, D.C.]], to take a position as an anti-corruption team leader.

==Awards and nominations==
[[Nicolas Falacci]] and [[Cheryl Heuton]], the show's creators, have won several awards for the show, including the [[Carl Sagan Award for Public Understanding of Science]] in 2006,&lt;ref name="carlsaganaward"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbs.com/primetime/numb3rs/ |title=Official Numb3rs website |accessdate=2006-05-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[National Science Board]]'s Public Service Award in 2007.&lt;ref name="publicserviceaward"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=108701 |title=The "Numb3rs" Add Up: Popular TV Show and Its Creators Receive Public Service Award |publisher=[[National Science Board]] |date=April 16, 2007 |accessdate=2007-08-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the show's [[stunt coordinator]], Jim Vickers, was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Stunt Coordination|Outstanding Stunt Coordination]] in 2006 for episode 14 of Season&amp;nbsp;2, "[[Harvest (Numbers)|Harvest]]".&lt;ref name="imdb_awards"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0433309/awards |title=Awards for "Numb3rs" |publisher=[[IMDB]] |accessdate=2007-08-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Representation of mathematics==
{{cquote|We all use math every day; to predict weather, to tell time, to handle money. Math is more than formulas or equations; it's logic, it's rationality, it's using your mind to solve the biggest mysteries we know.}}

Several mathematicians work as [[consultant]]s for each episode.&lt;ref name="wolfram_consultants"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.wolfram.com/2007/05/the_mathematica_behind_televis.html?lid=title |title=The Math(ematica) behind Television's Crime Drama NUMB3RS |first=Eric |last=Weisstein |authorlink=Eric Weisstein |accessdate=2007-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hollywood_consulting"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodmath.com/projects.htm |title=Hollywood Math and Science Film Consulting |accessdate=2007-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Elizabeth |last=Weise |url=http://www.math.caltech.edu/USA%20Today.html |title=They're Calculatingly Cool |publisher=[[USA Today]] |date=February 9, 2005 |accessdate=2007-10-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Actual mathematics is presented in the show; the equations on the chalkboards are mathematically valid, and are somewhat applicable to the situations presented in each show. This mathematical validity and applicability of the equations has been asserted by professional mathematicians.&lt;ref name="wolfram_consultants" /&gt;&lt;ref name="devlin"&gt;{{cite web |first=Keith |last=Devlin |url=http://www.maa.org/devlin/devlin_02_05.html |title=NUMB3RS gets the math right |publisher=[[Mathematical Association of America]] |accessdate=2007-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mathgames"&gt;{{cite web |first=Ed Jr. |last=Pegg |authorlink=Ed Pegg, Jr. |url=http://www.maa.org/editorial/mathgames/mathgames_01_21_05.html |title=Math Games – The NUMB3RS TV show |publisher=[[Mathematical Association of America]] |date=January 21, 2005 |accessdate=2007-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A book entitled ''The Numbers Behind NUMB3RS: Solving Crime with Mathematics'' ({{isbn|0452288576}}; published August 28, 2007), written by [[Keith Devlin]] and Dr. Gary Lorden, a consultant to the show along with Dr. Orara, a physics consultant, explain some of the mathematical techniques that have been used both in actual FBI cases and in other law enforcement departments.&lt;ref name="devlin_book"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Numbers Behind NUMB3RS: Solving Crime with Mathematics (Paperback) |publisher=[[Amazon.com]] | ISBN=0-452-28857-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="redhawke_books"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.redhawke.org/content/view/347/89/ |title=NUMB3RS Books and DVDs |author=Lady Shelley |accessdate=2007-08-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the premiere season, the blog edited by Prof. Mark Bridger (Northeastern University) has commented on the mathematics behind each episode of the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atsweb.neu.edu/math/cp/blog/? |title=Numb3rs blog |publisher=Northeastern University |date=2005-06-14 |accessdate=2010-06-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202040230/http://www.atsweb.neu.edu/math/cp/blog/ |archivedate=February 2, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wolfram Research]] (the developers of ''[[Mathematica]]'') is the chief math consultant, reviewing scripts and providing background mathematics for the show. Starting with season four, their website in collaboration with CBS is entitled "The math behind ''NUMB3RS''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://numb3rs.wolfram.com |title=NUMB3RS Episode 412-Power-Wolfram Research Math Notes |publisher=Numb3rs.wolfram.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One part-time mathematician consultant to the show has expressed concern with its use of mathematics, asserting that the math is inserted after the initial script and written to provide plausible sounding [[jargon]], rather than having consultants involved at all stages of story development.&lt;ref name="silverberg"&gt;{{cite journal
| last = Silverberg | authorlink = Alice Silverberg
| first = Alice |date=November 2006 |title=Alice in NUMB3Rland |journal=FOCUS |volume=26 |issue=8 |pages=12–13 |url=http://www.math.uci.edu/~asilverb/bibliography/numb3rland.pdf |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same part-time consultant offered criticism of the show's portrayal of female mathematicians and expressed concern over the appropriateness of the relationship between [[Charlie Eppes]] and his graduate student [[Amita Ramanujan]].&lt;ref name="silverberg" /&gt;

==Production==
The idea for ''Numbers'' was generated in the late 1990s when Nick Falacci and Cheryl Heuton, the show's creators, attended a lecture given by [[Bill Nye]], a popular [[Science education|science educator]].&lt;ref name="nye"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1137661,00.html|title=The Numb3rs Guy |publisher=Time Magazine |date=December 4, 2005 |accessdate=2007-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The premise of the show is similar to that of author Colin Bruce's reimaginings of the [[Sherlock Holmes]] character,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Jonas |first=Gerald|title=The Strange Case |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/10/05/bib/971005.rv102432.html | work=The New York Times |date=5 October 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to the "[[Mathnet]]" segment on the children's television show ''[[Square One Television|Square One]]''.

[[Gabriel Macht]] was originally cast to portray the character of Don Eppes.&lt;ref name="Point of Origin"&gt;{{cite video |people=Cheryl Heuton (co-creator/co-executive producer), Nicolas Falacci (co-creator-executive producer), Ridley Scott (executive producer), Tony Scott (executive producer), David W.

Scenes which take place at CalSci are filmed at [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech)&lt;ref name="imdb_trivia" /&gt; and the [[University of Southern California]]. One of the most frequent campus locations at Caltech is the vicinity of [[:Image:Millikan Library, Caltech.jpg|Millikan Library]], including the bridge over Millikan Pond, the Trustees room, and the arcades of nearby buildings. At USC, locations include Doheny Library and the Town and Gown dining room. Exteriors for the FBI offices are on the distinctive bridge at [[Los Angeles Center Studios]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://us.imdb.com/title/tt0433309/locations |title="Numb3rs" (2005) - Filming locations |publisher=Us.imdb.com |date=2009-05-01 |accessdate=2010-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another common location is the [[American Craftsman|Craftsman home]] of the Eppes family. The house shown in the first season is real; it is owned by David Raposa and Edward Trosper,&lt;ref name="craftsmanhome"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/feb/17/home/hm-numbers17 |title=Arts and Crafts by the 'Numb3rs' |first=Christy |last=Hobart |work=Los Angeles Times |date=February 17, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although a [[replica]] set was used from the second season onwards.&lt;ref name="setfilming"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fanrush.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=15 |title=NUMB3RS.org forum |accessdate=2007-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Title of the show===
The show uses the number three in its title instead of the letter "e".  In interviews with Tom Jicha of the ''[[South Florida Sun Sentinel|South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]'' and with Alan Pergament of ''[[The Buffalo News]]'', Heuton mentioned that the use of the number three in the title derives from [[leet]], a form of computer jargon that replaces letters with numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Jicha|first=Tom|title=Doing the Math – CBS Hopes Its New Equation for the Crime Drama, Pairing a Detective and a Genius, Will Add up to a Hit |newspaper=[[South Florida Sun Sentinel|South Florida Sun-Sentinel]] |location=[[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]]|date=22 January 2005 | url= http://iw.newsbank.com/resources/doc/nb/news/107C960544014224?p=NewsBank |accessdate=26 February 2015}}{{subscription required| via=Newsbank}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Pergament |first=Alan |title='Numb3rs' Viewers Probably Won't Be Willing to Do the Math |newspaper=[[The Buffalo News]] | location=[[Buffalo, New York]]| publisher=[[The Buffalo News]] |date=20 January 2005 |url=http://iw.newsbank.com/resources/doc/nb/news/107C908EC4021785?p=NewsBank |accessdate=27 February 2015}}{{subscription required| via=Newsbank}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dr. Gary Lorden, a [[California Institute of Technology]] mathematics professor who served as the show's mathematics consultant, told [[National Public Radio|NPR]]'s Ira Flatow that it was created on a normal computer keyboard.  Lorden also mentioned that the use of the number three in the title can serve as a restriction in Internet searches about the series.&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;{{cite web |author=[[National Public Radio]] |title=The 'Numb3rs' Don't Lie |work=[[National Public Radio]] |publisher=[[National Public Radio]] |date=5 October 2007 |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=15039360 |accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both entertainment reporters and psychologists noticed the title's spelling.

I've been fighting that for weeks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rice|first=Lynette|title=Smart Throb|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|location=[[New York City, New York]] |publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=14 February 2005|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1026706,00.html|accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (The [[sigma]] (∑) stands for [[summation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Weiss |first=David J. |title=Review of Mathematical Symbols |work=Psy302: Statistical Methods |publisher=[[California State University, Los Angeles]] |date=21 September 2001 |url=http://instructional1.calstatela.edu/dweiss/Psy302/Symbols.htm |accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;)  Others used varying adjectives to describe the title.  The TV site [[Zap2it.com]] called it "their typographical silliness, not ours".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=dmason |title=CBS is counting on 'Numb3rs' |work=[[Ventura County Star]] |location=[[Camarillo, California]]| publisher=[[Ventura County Star]] |date=4 December 2004 |url=http://iw.newsbank.com/resources/doc/nb/news/1076B5146BD80512?p=NewsBank |accessdate=28 February 2015}}{{subscription required| via=Newsbank}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Brad Aspey of ''[[The Muskegon Chronicle]]'', stated, "No, that wasn’t an ugly typo you just read - “NUMB3ERS” (pronounced numbers) is the idiosyncratic title of filmmakers Ridley and Tony Scott’s astute and crafty psychological drama which shows that even math can make for edge-of-your-seat entertainment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Aspey |first=Brad |title='Regular' TV finally getting the message from cable |work=[[The Muskegon Chronicle]] |location=[[Muskegon, Michigan]] |publisher=[[The Muskegon Chronicle]] |date=28 January 2005 |url=http://iw.newsbank.com/resources/doc/nb/news/11406B3D9777EDE5?p=NewsBank  |accessdate=28 February 2015}}{{subscription required| via=Newsbank}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ellen Gray of ''[[The Philadelphia Daily News]]'', said, "Some of you may have noticed that in promoting "Numb3rs," which premieres Sunday before moving to its regular 10 p.m. Friday slot, CBS has chosen to put a 3 in place of the "e" in the title….I won't be going along with this particular affectation, which slows down my typing and seems to be the graphic equivalent of the reversed "R" in Toys R Us.

Still others had a more positive view of the title.  When NPR's Flatow asked both Lorden and Dr. Keith Devlin, NPR's mathematics reporter, about the title, both men denied creating the title; Devlin believed that executive producer [[Tony Scott]] originated the title.  Lorden stated that he initially thought that the title was "kind of hokey" but later saw it as "brilliant" and a "catchy logo".&lt;ref name="NPR"/&gt;  Jonathan Storm of ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', in his review of the series stated, "You'd think CBS's new Numbers, which premieres at 10 tonight after the Patriots-Steelers football game, is just another one of those shows with numskull titles trying to draw attention to themselves.  But the "3" substituting for the "e" is actually based on a real thing"….  He later said that the show was "written by people familiar with the Dead Cow Cult".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Storm |first=Jonathan |title=Solving Crimes by the 'Numb3rs' |work=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] |location=[[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] |publisher=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] |date=23 January 2005 |url=http://iw.newsbank.com/resources/doc/nb/news/107D72D2F66DE363?p=NewsBank |accessdate=27 February 2015}}{{subscription required| via=Newsbank}}&lt;/ref&gt;  David Brooks of ''[[The Telegraph (Nashua)|The Telegraph (Nashua, NH)]]'' devoted the majority of his entire review to the use of leet in the series title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Brooks |first=David |title=C4n y0u r34d 7h15?

In [[argumentation theory|argumentation]], an '''objection''' is a reason [[argument|arguing]] against a [[premise]], [[argument]], or [[conclusion of law|conclusion]]. Definitions of objection vary in whether an objection is always an argument (or [[counterargument]]) or may include other moves such as questioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

{{nihongo|'''''PaRappa the Rapper 2'''''|パラッパラッパー2|Parappa Rappā Tsū}} is a [[Rhythm game|rhythm action]] video game published by [[Sony Computer Entertainment]] and developed by [[NanaOn-Sha]] for the [[PlayStation 2]]. The game is the third title in the ''[[PaRappa the Rapper]]'' series following ''[[Um Jammer Lammy]]''. On December 14, 2015, the game was made available for the [[PlayStation 4]] through the [[PlayStation Network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/11/parappa-the-rapper-2-is-coming-to-ps4 |title=PaRappa the Rapper 2 is Coming to PS4 |last=Copeland |first=Wesley |work=[[IGN]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=Dec 11, 2015 |accessdate=Dec 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
{{see also|PaRappa the Rapper#Gameplay|l1=Gameplay of PaRappa the Rapper}}
[[File:PaRappa the Rapper 2 Screenshot.jpeg|thumb|left|The player must match their button presses to the symbols shown on screen.]]
Gameplay follows that of its predecessors, in which the player must press buttons to make Parappa rap in response to a teacher's lyrics. Players earn points and progress by rapping in time to the music and maintaining a Good rating through to the end of each level. By successfully improvising raps, the player can obtain a Cool rating, during which Parappa will be given the chance to rap freestyle by himself. If the player performs badly, however, they will drop down a rating to Bad and Awful, with the player losing if they drop below Awful or end the song with a Bad or Awful rating. ''PaRappa 2'' features some tweaks to the gameplay, as some of the teacher's lyrics may change based on the player's performance. For example, the lyrics may become simpler if the player is struggling, or become tougher if they perform well.
After clearing two stages in a row, players can participate in a minigame where they must hit targets held out by Chop Chop Master Onion's Tamanegi students, earning bonus points which are added onto the previous level's score. Clearing each level with a Cool rating unlocks music tracks that can be listened to after completing the game. Each time the player clears the game, the color of Parappa's hat changes from blue, to pink, to yellow, with each hat remixing the lines in each level. In addition to the single player campaign, the game features a two-player Vs. Mode, in which players are given a line to rap to, which they must improve upon by freestyling better than their opponent.

===Region differences===
Similar to ''[[Um Jammer Lammy]]'', the North American release of ''PaRappa the Rapper 2'' features some censorship when compared to the Japanese and PAL versions of the game, replacing lyrics referring to alcohol and religion in order to ensure an E rating from the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board|ESRB]].

In Japan, [[McDonald's]] released a demo disc alongside its [[Happy Meal]], containing a demo of the first level modelled after a McDonald's restaurant, alongside a demo of ''[[Pipo Saru 2001]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2008/02/14/parappa-sony-and-the-mcdonald%E2%80%99s-happy-disc-part-2/|title=PaRappa, Sony and the McDonald's Happy Disc part 2|author=Spencer|date=14 February 2008|publisher=[[Siliconera]]|accessdate=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Parappa, having won a 100 years' supply of [[instant noodles|instant noodle]] products, has grown sick of eating nothing but noodles for every meal every single day. When Parappa complains about being served noodles by his crush, Sunny Funny, he becomes shocked when she calls him a baby, causing him to question his own maturity. When Parappa and his friend P.J. Berri go to eat at Beard Burger instead, they learn that a mysterious phenomenon is turning all the food in town into noodles. As Parappa and Sunny's respective fathers, Papa Parappa and General Potter, try to develop an invention that can stop the "noodelization", they inadvertently shrink themselves and everyone else in the process, but they are soon helped out by the Guru Ant and return to normal size. After undergoing army training under Instructor Moosesha, Parappa helps rescue a Hairdresser Octopus from being possessed into giving people afros, discovering "Food Court" a video game cartridge to be the cause. Upon reverse engineering the cartridge, Parappa and the others use sweets to combat against the Noodle Syndicate behind the town's noodlelization. They soon confront the mastermind, Colonel Noodle, who is revealed to be the son of Beard Burger Master who (similar to Parappa's situation) had grown sick of eating burgers all of his life, deciding that noodles should rule the world instead. However, Parappa manages to convince him to be more open-minded about different types of foods, and everyone celebrates with a party, where Sunny assures Parappa that he is more mature than he thinks himself to be. Things soon return to normal, only for Parappa to repeat his turmoil when he ends up winning another lifetime supply of cheese.

The game received "mixed to positive" reviews according to the [[Review aggregator|review aggregation]] website [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name="MC"/&gt;

[[GameSpot]]'s [[Jeff Gerstmann]] gave the game a 6.6, stating that "an almost total lack of innovation makes the game seem pretty dated when compared with other games on the market. ... Even when played to perfection, though, the rapping still sounds just as stuttery as it did in the previous game. While it was excusable then and perhaps even a little charming, it would have been nice to see the developers make better use of the PlayStation 2's higher specs."  Though the game "features the same 2D graphical style as its predecessor, but it's not without its share of enhancements," he added, "The music in the game covers a lot more ground, genre-wise, than the original did, but none of it is especially funny or toe-tapping--with the exception of the level that takes place inside an old video game machine. PaRappa 2 isn't a bad game, but it doesn't have as much of the same off-beat charm that the original--and to a lesser extent, Um Jammer Lammy--had."&lt;ref name="GSparappa2"/&gt;  However, [[IGN]]'s Douglass C. Perry gave the game a slightly better score of 7, saying, "The game concept hasn't changed, leaning neither toward an evolutionary or even a moderate change in the way gamers play music games. ... [''PaRappa 2'' is] not as hard as Um Jammer Lammy (which may be good for some folks), and it certainly covers familiar territory when it comes to the essentials -- gameplay, graphics, and sound -- but it's still fun and happy-making."&lt;ref name="IGNparappa2"/&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Parasyte'''''|寄生獣|Kiseijū|lit. "Parasitic Beasts"|lead=yes}} is a [[science fiction]] [[Horror film|horror]] [[manga]] series written and illustrated by [[Hitoshi Iwaaki]], and published in [[Kodansha]]'s ''[[Afternoon (magazine)|Afternoon]]'' magazine from 1988 to 1995. The manga was published in North America by first [[Tokyopop]], then [[Del Rey Manga|Del Rey]], and finally [[Kodansha Comics]]. The manga has been adapted into two [[live-action]] films in Japan in 2014 and 2015. An [[anime]] television series adaptation by [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]], titled {{Nihongo|'''''Parasyte -the maxim-'''''|寄生獣 セイの格率|Kiseijū Sei no Kakuritsu}}, aired in Japan between October 2014 and March 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-11-19/hitoshi-iwaaki-parasyte-sci-fi-manga-also-gets-tv-anime|title=Hitoshi Iwaaki's Parasyte Sci-Fi Manga Also Gets TV Anime|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=November 19, 2013|accessdate=November 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The English-language dub aired on Adult Swim's Toonami block in America between October 2015 and April 2016.

==Plot==
[[File:ParasyteAttack.jpg|thumb|left|A manga panel showing a Parasite getting ready to attack a human being.]]
''Parasyte'' centers on a male 17-year-old high school student named Shinichi Izumi, who lives with his mother and father in a quiet neighborhood in [[Tokyo]], Japan. One night, strange worm-like creatures with drills as a 'head' called Parasytes appear on Earth, taking over the brains of human hosts by entering through their ears or noses. One Parasite attempts to crawl into Shinichi's nose while he sleeps, but fails as Shinichi wakes up, and enters his body by burrowing into his arm instead. In the Japanese version, it takes over his right hand and is named {{nihongo|Migi|ミギー}}, after the Japanese word for 'right'; Tokyopop's 1990s English version, in which the images are flipped horizontally, has the Parasite take over Shinichi's left hand and it is named Lefty.

Because Shinichi was able to prevent Migi from travelling further up into his brain, both beings retain their separate intellect and personality. As the duo encounter other Parasites, they capitalize on their strange situation and gradually form a strong bond, working together to survive. This gives them an edge in battling other Parasites who frequently attack the pair upon realization that Shinichi's human brain is still intact. Shinichi feels compelled to fight other Parasites, who devour humans as food, while enlisting Migi's help.

:Shinichi is the protagonist of the manga, a thoughtful, compassionate high-school boy whose hand is infected with a Parasite and is repeatedly put into difficult positions. He must find a way to peacefully coexist with Migi, the Parasite which has taken over his hand, and reconcile his desire to protect humanity from the Parasites with his desire to keep his own Parasite a secret in order to avoid being killed or used as a laboratory specimen. Like a [[superhero]] with a secret identity, he must also find a way to explain away his Parasite-fighting activities, as well as the stress and grief they cause him, to his friends and family. While originally forced to have Migi fight for him, Shinichi later gains heightened abilities when trace cells of the Parasite course through his body, and fights his own battles, with the two having an advantage in both being able to act independently and work as a team. Shinichi's retention of his humanity, despite gradually becoming emotionally distant as a side-effect of Migi's cells, makes most of the other Parasites deem him a threat. After defeating Gotou, with Migi deciding to "go to sleep" indefinitely afterward, Shinichi attempts to live a normal life again while having an understanding of natural order from his experience.

:Masanori Harada, a 20-year-old student, wrote to the editor of the ''Monthly Afternoon'' noted that Shinichi acts calm when he is threatened and that he is "not human anymore!" Iwaaki responded, stating that Shinichi is accustomed to "close calls" partly because Migi calms Shinichi down during battle. The statement and response were printed in the April 1993 ''Afternoon''.&lt;ref name="DelReyVol5181"&gt;[[Hitoshi Iwaaki|Iwaaki, Hitoshi]] (translated by Andrew Cunningham). ''Parasyte'' Volume 5. [[Del Rey Manga]]. P. 181&lt;/ref&gt;

:Shinichi is portrayed by [[Shota Sometani]] in the film.

:Migi is the Parasite which lives in Shinichi's right hand, named after the Japanese word for {{nihongo|"right"|右|migi}}. Unlike "successful" Parasites, Migi has no desire to kill humans for sustenance, and is nourished by the food Shinichi eats. Migi is, like other Parasites, completely without emotion. His primary consideration is survival, and he has threatened (and in some cases attempted) to kill other humans who pose a threat to his and Shinichi's secrecy. When he and Shinichi were first coming to terms, he even threatened to remove Shinichi's other limbs in order to render him unable to place the two of them in danger. Migi can be reasoned with, however, and has just as much reason to be mistrustful of other Parasites as does Shinichi. On the other hand, unlike Shinichi, Migi has no inclination to place himself at risk in order to protect other humans from Parasites. But Migi gradually evolves over the course of the series, he becomes more human while able to temporarily separate from Shinichi's body. After the final battle with Gotou, having been absorbed by the Parasite prior to his defeat, Migi's composition is greatly altered to the point that enters a deep sleep though he briefly woke up to save Satomi without Shinichi's realization. 

:Iwaaki explained that while Migi appears to be Shinichi's weapon, in fact Migi is in control of the battle and orders around Shinichi. Iwaaki explained that Migi is easily able to order Shinichi since Shinichi is young and "needs guidance", while Migi would find difficulty if he became a part of a politician or a president of a company since in that scenario Migi and his host would argue a lot.&lt;ref name="DelReyVol5181"/&gt;

:An 18-year-old from [[Saitama Prefecture]] named "Midari" asked in the letters to the editor that if Migi took Shinichi's left hand, if he would have been named "Hidari". Iwaaki answered that it would be Hidari, but Iwaaki felt that the name would be similar to those of [[Bokuzen Hidari]] or Tenpei Hidari and the name would "bring to mind a doddering old man, so that wouldn't have been a good idea". Iwaaki then said that [[Sir Edmund Hillary|the first man to climb]] [[Mount Everest]] "had a name an awful lot like that..."&lt;ref name="DelReyVol5042"&gt;[[Hitoshi Iwaaki|Iwaaki, Hitoshi]] (translated by Andrew Cunningham). ''Parasyte'' Volume 5. [[Del Rey Manga]]. P. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

:Migi is voiced by [[Sadao Abe]] in the film.

===Humans===
;{{nihongo4|{{va|Satomi Murano}}|村野 里美|Murano Satomi}}
:{{anime voices|[[Kana Hanazawa]]|[[Luci Christian]]&lt;ref name="english cast" /&gt;}}

:Shinichi's best friend and love interest. She is a thoughtful, tender-hearted young girl who cares deeply for her friends. While Satomi and Shinichi are mutually attracted towards one another, their relationship is strained to the breaking point when Shinichi’s life is thrown in turmoil by the Parasites.

:From the moment she is introduced, Satomi is depicted as being romantically attracted towards Shinichi due to his kind and sensitive nature.  Consequently, she is utterly grief-stricken as she watches him grow ever more cold and withdrawn over the course of the story. Despite her best efforts to find out the reason behind Shinichi’s behavior, Satomi becomes increasingly estranged from him as he desperately strives to keep her in the dark about Migi and the Parasite threat. As a result, she begins to question whether any trace of the gentle, caring boy she originally fell in love with remains.  After losing nearly all hope, Satomi’s faith in Shinichi is restored upon witnessing him cry freely while protectively cradling Reiko’s orphaned baby in his arms. Upon learning that Shinichi is part Parasite at the end of the series, Satomi firmly proclaims this does nothing to diminish his humanity because he still regards all life as precious. 

:Satomi is played by [[Ai Hashimoto]] in the film.

;{{nihongo4|{{va|Kana Kimishima}}|君嶋 加奈|Kimishima Kana}}
:{{anime voices|[[Miyuki Sawashiro]]|[[Maggie Flecknoe]]}}
:Kana is a disobedient "bad girl" who develops a crush on Shinichi. She is attracted to him because of his sensitive personality, and because she can sense something "different" about him. In reality, Kana has the inexplicable psychic ability to sense Parasites. However, her senses are not as fine tuned as those of the Parasites themselves. Kana mistakes this sense as a psychic connection to Shinichi; foolishly believing it was fate leading her to her true love. This ability is eventually what leads to her death when she is told about the Parasites, and a total breakdown of Shinichi for a good volume or so, until he recovers from it; the after effects of this led to estranging him from his friends and get police to keep an eye on him, all of which last until near the final volume.

;{{nihongo4|{{va|Yuko Tachikawa}}|立川 裕子|Tachikawa Yūko}}
:{{anime voices|[[Kiyono Yasuno]]|[[Terri Doty]]&lt;ref name="english cast" /&gt;}}
:One of Satomi's two best friends. Her brother works as a criminal profiling illustrator for the police department. Due to her seeing her brother's sketches of Parasites and her crush on Hideo Shimada, she ended up at the center of a highly dangerous situation.

;{{nihongo4|{{va|Uragami}}|浦上}}
:{{anime voices|[[Hiroyuki Yoshino (voice actor)|Hiroyuki Yoshino]]|Andrew Love&lt;ref name="english cast" /&gt;}}
:A cannibalistic serial killer who has the ability to distinguish between humans and Parasites, believing himself to be the definition of human nature and able to point out a killer. He is brought in by the military to help them in their operation to exterminate the Parasites in East Fukuyama City, but escapes when the military unit is slaughtered by Gotou. He returns at the end of the series, taking Satomi hostage to confront Shinichi to see if he has the same world views as he does.
:Uragami is played by [[Hirofumi Arai]] in the film.

;{{nihongo4|{{va|Kazuyuki Izumi}}|泉 一之|Izumi Kazuyuki}}
:{{anime voices|Masaki Aizawa|[[Rob Mungle]]&lt;ref name="english cast" /&gt;}}
:Kazuyuki is Shinichi's father. Shortly after his wife was killed by a Parasite, he had some suspicions as to whether or not Shinichi was infected (although he never said so outright).

;{{nihongo4|{{va|Nobuko Izumi}}|泉 信子|Izumi Nobuko}}
:{{anime voices|Chieko Sasai|[[Allison Sumrall]]&lt;ref name="english cast" /&gt;}}
:Nobuko is Shinichi's mother, expressing concern over her son's strange behavior. She dies early on when she is decapitated by a Parasite that needed a compatible body to transfer to when her male replacement body started to reject her. As the Parasite assumed Nobuko's appearance, Shinichi let himself open and got himself nearly killed in the initial encounter. But Shinichi later manages to avenge his mother's death and kills the Parasite with Uda's help.
:Nobuko is played by [[Kimiko Yo]] in the film.

;{{nihongo4|{{va|Kazuki Nagai}}|長井 和輝|Nagai Kazuki}}
:{{anime voices|Shinya Hamazoe|Houston Hayes}}
:One of Shinichi's classmates at high school. He had a crush on Murano and therefore was jealous of Shinichi, beating him up outside the gym in the anime. After Shinichi intervened while he was being jumped by Mitsuo's gang, he's changed his demeanor. Nagai is quick to jump into situations as seen when he got in Shimada's face for confronting Shinichi. The scene where Nagai assaults Shinichi after gym class, originally involved a character called Kotani. Due to Kotani being omitted from the ''Parasyte -the maxim- anime'' series, the scene was transferred to Nagai.

;{{nihongo4|{{va|Mitsuo}}|光夫}}
:{{anime voices|[[Kenn (Japanese actor)|KENN]]|Scott Gibbs}}
: A student from Kana's school and possibly her ex-boyfriend, he is jealous of her crush on Shinichi.

;{{nihongo4|Makiko Hayase|早瀬 真樹子|Hayase Makiko}}
:{{anime voices|[[Yū Serizawa]]|[[Margaret McDonald (voice actor)|Margaret McDonald]]}}
:Makiko is a young schoolgirl who lives with her parents, grandfather, and younger brother in the small town where Shinichi's father is hospitalized. Her family owns a hotel in the town where Shinichi stays for a few days, in order to be near his father. It is shown that she develops a crush on Shinichi during his stay.

;{{nihongo4|{{va|Mamoru Uda}}|宇田 守|Uda Mamoru}}
:{{anime voices|[[Takuma Suzuki]]|[[Mark Laskowski|Mark X. Laskowski]]}}
:Uda is, like Shinichi, a human who had a Parasite merged with a part of his body other than his brain. In Uda's case, the Parasite took over the lower part of his head and face, most notably his jaw. Uda's Parasite originally does not have a name, but is later renamed {{nihongo4|'''Joe'''|ジョー|Jō|after the english word "jaw"}} ({{anime voices|[[Ayumu Murase]]|[[Greg Ayres]]}}). It is brash and crude, seemingly having a sense of humor, and often assumes control of Uda's mouth, distorting it into odd shapes and forcing Uda to say strange or inappropriate things. The pair befriend Shinichi and Migi, but preferring to simply avoid Parasites. Because Uda is slightly overweight and his Parasite is located in the jaw area, fights with other Parasites tend to leave him out of breath. However, because it is located in the lower part of the head, his Parasite can extend itself downward into his chest, protecting his heart (a primary target for hostile Parasites). Uda is a peaceful, easygoing man, but is shown to be nervous under pressure and highly emotional, often crying easily. He works as a hotel employee.

;{{nihongo4|{{va|Shiro Kuramori}}|倉森 志郎|Kuramori Shirō}}
:{{anime voices|[[Issei Futamata]]|[[Jay Hickman (actor)|Jay Hickman]]}}
:A private investigator hired by Reiko to spy on Shinichi and caught by Migi when he takes picture of them. When his assistant Taro goes missing, Shiro asks Shinichi to find him, and ends up recording a fight between Shinichi and a Parasite. Later his family is killed by Parasites, and in a frenzy of grief he kidnaps Reiko's infant son, leading to a critical confrontation at a park.

;{{nihongo4|{{va|Takeshi Hirokawa}}|広川 剛志|Hirokawa Takeshi}}
:{{anime voices|[[Yū Mizushima]]|[[John Gremillion]]}}
: The ringleader of a Parasite conspiracy to conquer humanity and the story's main antagonist alongside Reiko Tamura. A fanatical environmentalist, he firmly believes the Parasites' purpose is to cull the human population for the greater good of the planet. 

:Mid-way through the series, Takeshi Hirokawa is elected mayor of East Fukuyama City, a small municipality close to Shinichi's hometown. Subsequently, he uses his authority to set up safehouses where the Parasites can safely kill and eat their victims in secret. After Shinichi and Migi disrupt the operation of one of these facilities, Hirokawa targets them for elimination. Eventually, he and most of the Parasites comprising his organization are killed by a police taskforce once their plans are uncovered by the authorities. 

;{{nihongo4|{{va|Hirama}}|平間}}
:{{anime voices|[[Takuma Suzuki]]|[[George Manley]]}}
:A veteran detective who first suspected Shinichi for Kana's death.

;{{nihongo4|{{va|Yamagishi}}|山岸}}
:{{anime voices|[[Rikiya Koyama]]|Josh Morrison}}
:A police officer assigned to the Parasyte Extermination Squad, who is eventually beheaded by Gotou.

;{{nihongo4|{{va|Mitsuyo}}|美津代}}
:{{anime voices|Seiko Fujiki|Vicki Barosh}}
:An old woman who gave shelter to Shinichi after his fight with Gotou in the forest. After staying for a while, he left to have the final confrontation with Gotou.

===Parasites===
The antagonists of the series. The Parasites are creatures of unknown origin which start off as worm-like creatures that instinctively enter the body of the nearest life form and travel to the brain to completely assimilate it while destroying the host's identity in the process. From there, using the vital organs of the host bodies to survive, the Parasites would be driven with a need to kill humans and Parasites with failed host bodies. After assimilating their host, Parasites exhibit a variety of abilities that make them dangerous adversaries: the immediate area around their entry site (typically the head) is morphed into a versatile "parasite tissue" which can take a variety of offensive and defensive forms, and a parasite that successfully takes over a host's brain can then maximize the physical potential of that host.  In general, Parasite intelligence is comparable to humans, though their thought process is strictly rational and cold, with very little emotion.  They are also capable of learning extremely quickly depending on their environment - Migi, for example, mastered Japanese after one night of reading books on the subject.  While most Parasites initially acted alone, causing a chain of multiple grisly deaths coined the "mincemeat murders", they eventually form groups for safety in numbers. By the time of the final chapter, Shinichi speculating that they might have been created as an evolutionary countermeasure to humans, the surviving Parasites are assumed to have gone into hiding and adopt themselves further into human society to keep their activities to a minimum.

;{{nihongo4|{{va|Reiko Tamura}}|田村 玲子|Tamura Reiko}}
:{{anime voices|[[Atsuko Tanaka (voice actress)|Atsuko Tanaka]]|Joanne Bonasso}}
:An extremely intelligent, ruthless Parasite and \the series' main antagonist alongside Takeshi Hirokawa. She originally infected and took on the identity of a woman named {{nihongo4|'''Ryōko Tamiya'''|田宮 良子|Tamiya Ryōko}}, one of Shinichi's high school teachers while suggesting a beneficial ceasefire. Unlike most of her kind, she is motivated by scientific inclinations with a drive to understand her kind's biology, origin, and purpose. She learned that she is pregnant with a normal human infant as a consequence of being impregnated by Mr. A, deeming it interesting while forced to quit to avoid unwanted attention resulting from it. Though she intended to kill Shinichi soon after, she lets him and Migi live unmolested largely because she finds them an interesting anomaly worthy of study. After killing off Ryōko's parents when they saw through her, the Parasite alters her face and creates the identity of "Reiko Tamura" while aligning herself with Takeshi Hirokawa. She eventually gives birth to Mr. A's baby and later kills three of her fellow Parasites when they deemed her actions with a hired detective a threat to their plans. It was after Reiko killed the maddened detective to save her child that she allowed the police to brutally gun her down in a park instead of trying to resist or escape. The baby survives because of her protection and decision not to fight back against or run away from the police. 
:Tamura is portrayed by [[Eri Fukatsu]] in the film.

;{{nihongo4|{{va|Mr. B}}|B}}
:{{anime voices|[[Tōru Nara]]|Mike Yager}}
:A Parasite who attacks Shinichi and tries to coerce Migi into relocating to his arm in order to extend his own lifespan. To his surprise, Migi kills him on the pretense that relocation is too risky to try.

;{{nihongo4|{{va|Mr. A}}|A|Ē}}
:{{anime voices|Makoto Yasumura|[[David Wald]]}}
: An highly aggressive Parasite formerly aligned with Reiko Tamura. When first introduced, he (or rather, his host body) fathers a child with Reiko as part of the latter's experiment. Described by Migi as "not one of our smart ones" and called a fool by Reiko, Mr. A is extremely impulsive and animalistic. He has little capacity for caution or forethought to the point of killing numerous people without hesitation in front of witnesses. Shinichi is forced to battle Mr. A when he attempts to hunt Shinichi down and kill him at school. Though Shinichi and Migi mortally wound him, they are forced to flee before they can kill him. Mr. A attempts to find Reiko to transfer himself to her body and survive, but she rigs the room to explode to completely destroy him to preserve her human cover.

;{{nihongo4|{{va|Hideo Shimada}}|島田 秀雄|Shimada Hideo}}
:{{anime voices|[[Akira Ishida]]|[[Blake Shepard]]}}
:Hideo is a Parasite with a teenager's body who decides to integrate with human society. Hideo enrolls in Shinichi's high school on Reiko's suggestion and expresses a desire to become friends with Shinichi, who does not trust him. Although Hideo is a relatively peaceful Parasite, he has no qualms about brutalizing or even killing bullies who try to start fights with him, and he continues to hunt humans despite claiming to be learning to eat like a person. But when Yuko uncovered his secret and confronts him about it, Hideo ends up being exposed to paint-thinner during the confrontation as Yuko manages to escape. The paint-thinner's chemical make-up disrupts Hideo's Parasite cells, causing him to go on an involuntary killing spree across the school. He is killed after he escapes to the roof, when Shinichi, using Migi to enhance his right arm's strength, throws a well-aimed stone through his chest, destroying his heart.
:Shimada is played by [[Masahiro Higashide]] in the film.

;{{nihongo4|{{va|Gotou}}|後藤|Gotō}}
:{{anime voices|[[Kazuhiko Inoue]]|[[Jason Douglas]]}}
: The strongest Parasite in the series and a major antagonist. His host body contains 4 additional Parasites that are completely under his control. Since most of his body mass is parasite tissue, he can achieve feats of strength and agility far in excess of normal parasite hosts and render nearly every inch of his skin impervious to gunfire and edged weapons. Despite being one of the more intelligent of his kind, Gotou is also one of the most brutal and aggressive. Whereas most Parasites kill solely to feed or terminate immediate threats, he often hunts humans for sport and sadistically toys with those who become his prey. Nevertheless, Gotou does possess his own peculiar code of honor as seen when he commends opponents for getting past his defenses and refrains from attacking Shinichi while Migi rests. The name "Gotō" is a pun as one of the [[kanji]] is synonymous with the kanji for {{nihongo4|five|五|go}}, a reference to how 5 Parasites inhabit his host.&lt;ref name="DelReyVol5290"&gt;[[Hitoshi Iwaaki|Iwaaki, Hitoshi]] (translated by Andrew Cunningham). ''Parasyte'' Volume 5. [[Del Rey Manga]]. P. 290&lt;/ref&gt;

:Gotou is introduced as the chief enforcer of a Parasite syndicate intent on conquering humanity led by Takeshi Hirokawa.  After Shinichi and Migi attack one of the syndicate's "dining areas", Gotou is tasked with eliminating them. During their first confrontation, he easily overwhelms the two but they manage to withstand his attacks long enough to escape. Later, when the syndicate is destroyed in an [[Special Assault Team|SAT]] operation, Gotou singlehandedly wipes out the attacking police force before targeting Shinichi and Migi once again. In their  ensuing rematch, Gotou absorbs Migi after the latter sacrifices himself so Shinichi can retreat.  During the story’s climax, Shinichi manages to poison him by stabbing one of his body's few vulnerable areas with a contaminated pipe. As a result, Gotou loses control of the other Parasites within his body thereby enabling Migi to break free and help Shinichi finally defeat him. 

;{{nihongo4|{{va|Miki}}|三木||lit. Three trees}}
:{{anime voices|[[Daisuke Namikawa]]|Xero Reynolds}}
: One of the Parasites that composes Gotou's body. Similar to "Migi", Miki's default position in the body is the right arm. His name has an additional meaning, which means "Three trees", referencing how he is only able to manipulate 3 Parasites in the body (including himself) when he takes the head position. Unlike other Parasites, Miki has learned to show emotions just like humans.&lt;ref name="DelReyVol5290"/&gt; His body is composed of five Parasites, one in each of his arms and legs and another in his head, they can apparently swap their places in the body but only two of them are able to unify the five and make them fight as a single being.

;{{nihongo4|{{va|Kusano}}|草野}}
:{{anime voices|Takaya Aoyagi|[[Kalob Martinez]]}}
:A Parasite that allied himself with Reiko Tamura along with two others named "Hikawa" and "Maesawa." He later grows distrustful of Reiko Tamura when she argues against the notion of killing Shinichi despite the threat he poses to them. As Kusano's doubts about Reiko increase, he attempts to assassinate her with help from Maesawa and Hikawa. But his underestimation of Reiko's abilities results in the death of himself and his conspirators.

===Names in Tokyopop publication===
In the Tokyopop publication the main character's name was Shin and his hand was called "Lefty", as the image had been flipped to read left to right.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20030226111554/http://www.tokyopop.com/dbpage.php?propertycode=PAR&amp;categorycode=BMG&amp;page=characterinfo Parasyte: Character Info]." [[Tokyopop]]. February 26, 2003. Retrieved on June 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--The flipping is inferred from the publication of the Tokyopop volumes--&gt; Satomi Murano is Sara. Jaw, Uda's Parasite, is referred to as Jaws, in reference to the film ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' by [[Steven Spielberg]]. Reiko is known as Tamara Rockford in the Tokyopop version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030226112824/http://www.tokyopop.com/dbpage.php?page=product&amp;productid=1079|url=http://www.tokyopop.com/dbpage.php?page=product&amp;productid=1079|title=Parasyte: Volume 9|publisher=[[Tokyopop]]|archivedate=February 26, 2003|accessdate=June 6, 2009|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gotō's name was written without a macron.

==Development==
Iwaaki chose a high school setting due to a scene he had thought of. When considering a scene where Migi turns his shape into a penis in front of Satomi Murano, Iwaaki believed that the scene would work best in a high school setting, so Iwaaki gave ''Parasyte'' a high school setting.&lt;ref name="DelReyVol5288"&gt;[[Hitoshi Iwaaki|Iwaaki, Hitoshi]] (translated by Andrew Cunningham). ''Parasyte'' Volume 5. [[Del Rey Manga]]. P. 288&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kodansha Comics]] later republished the volumes in North America between 2011 and 2012.

===Live-action films===
Hollywood's [[New Line Cinema]] had acquired the film rights to ''Parasyte'' in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ajw.asahi.com/article/cool_japan/anime_news/AJ201311280040|title=Horror manga 'Parasyte' gets movie, anime television adaptation|last=|first=|date=28 November 2013|website=|publisher=[[Asahi Shimbun]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303183734/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/cool_japan/anime_news/AJ201311280040|archive-date=3 March 2016|dead-url=yes|accessdate=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a film adaptation was reported to be in the works, with [[Jim Henson Studios]] and [[Don Murphy]] allegedly in charge of production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2005-09-20/jim-henson-studios-to-produce-parasyte | title = Jim Henson Studios to produce Parasyte | publisher = [[Anime News Network]] | date=September 20, 2005|accessdate=November 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Line Cinema's option expired in 2013, prompting a bidding war in Japan. Film studio and distributor [[Toho]] won the rights, and decided to adapt the manga into a two-part live-action film series directed by [[Takashi Yamazaki]]. The first part, ''[[Parasyte: Part 1]]'', was released in November 2014 and the second part, ''[[Parasyte: Part 2]]'', was released in April 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-11-19/hitoshi-iwaaki-parasyte-sci-fi-manga-gets-2-live-action-films-in-2014-2015|title=Hitoshi Iwaaki's Parasyte Sci-Fi Manga Gets 2 Live-Action Films in 2014–2015|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=November 19, 2013|accessdate=November 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:JuanTamad.jpg|thumb|''[[Juan Tamad]]'' ("Lazy John"), a best example of Philippine folklore published in 1919. It illustrates the main character's laziness to climb a guava tree and pick a bearing fruit.]]
{{Philippine mythology 2}}
'''Philippine folk literature''' refers to the traditional [[oral literature]]  of the [[Filipino people]].  Thus, the scope of the field covers the ancient folk literature of the Philippines' various ethnic groups, as well as various pieces of folklore that have evolved since the Philippines became a single ethno-political unit.

While the difference between Philippine folk literature and [[Philippine mythology]] is a fine one,  this article distinguishes folk literature as the source from which Philippine mythology derives.

== Proponents of Philippine literature ==
This aims to revive the Spanish language and its influence in [[Filipinos|Filipino]]  writing. Another proponent of Philippine literature is Valeriano Hernandez Peña, the Father of the Tagalog Novel (''Ama ng Nobelang Tagalog''). He authored the ''Magkaibigang Nena at Neneng'' in 1905. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tagaloglang.com/philippine-literature/|title=PHILIPPINE LITERATURE|last=|first=|date=|website=Tagalog Lang|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philippine folk literature in oral and print formats ==

While the ''oral'', and thus ''changeable'', aspect of folk literature is an important defining characteristic, much of this oral tradition has been written into a print format. To point out that folklore in a written form can still be considered folklore, Utely points out that folklore "may appear in print, but must not freeze into print."&lt;ref name=Utely&gt;Utely, Francis Lee. "A Definition of Folklore," American Folklore, Voice of America Forum Lectures, ed. Tristram Coffin, III 1968, p14.&lt;/ref&gt;   It should be pointed out that all the examples of folk literature cited in this article are taken from print, rather than oral sources.

== Categories==

Eugenio classifies Philippine Folk Literature into three major groups: Folk narratives, folk speech, and folk songs.&lt;ref name="Anthology"&gt;Eugenio, Damiana (2007). Philippine Folk Literature: An Anthology, 2nd, Quezon City: University of the Philippines Press, 498. {{ISBN|978-971-542-536-0}}. &lt;/ref&gt;
Folk narratives can either be in prose -  the ''[[alamat]]'' (folklore), the [[legend]], and the ''[[kuwentong bayan]]'' (folktale) - or in verse, as in the case of the [[folk narrative]]. Folk speech includes the ''[[bugtong]]'' (riddle) and the ''[[salawikain]]'' (proverbs). [[Folk songs]] can be sub-classified into those that tell a story (folk ballads), which are rare in Philippine folk literature, and those that do not, which form the bulk of the Philippines' rich heritage of folk songs.

== As an example of Southeast Asian folklore ==
 
Since it comes from a Southeast Asian nation, Philippine folk literature can be counted as a representative of [[Southeast Asian folklore]].  This is not a simple categorization, however, for two important reasons.&lt;ref&gt; Osborne, Milton (2004). Southeast Asia: An Introductory History, Ninth Edition, Australia: Allen &amp; Unwin. {{ISBN|1-74114-448-5}}. 
&lt;/ref&gt;

First, [[Southeast Asia]] as a distinct cultural region was not recognized until the political environment after the Second World War.

Second, even as the idea of a Southeast Asia was being conceived, the inclusion of the Philippines in the region was consistently in debate because of its very different cultural makeup.

Setting those two objections aside, Philippine folk literature would be considered a subset of the folklore of peninsular Southeast Asia, which includes the folklore of [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], and [[Brunei]]. This would be distinct from the folk literature of continental Southeast Asia, which includes [[Vietnam]], [[Thailand]], [[Myanmar]], [[Cambodia]], and others. The distinction roots from the geographical influence on the cultures arising from these countries. 

Like all of Southeast Asia, however, whether peninsular or continental, Philippine folk literature shows strong cultural influences from [[India]].

A major difference however, arises from the colonial influences in the development of Southeast Asian folk literature. The Philippines' 300 years of Spanish rule makes it unique, enough to earn the title of "a piece of Latin America in Southeast Asia."

== Continued evolution ==

While folklore is often associated with ancient times, newer recordings of Philippine folk literature have made in modern times. Quite aside from urban legends, modern legends attributing superhuman powers to powerful and charistmatic leaders such as former presidents [[Ramon Magsaysay]] and [[Ferdinand Marcos]] have been documented and accepted as full-fledged examples of Philippine folk literature.&lt;ref&gt;Eugenio, Damiana (2002). Philippine Folk Literature: The Legends. Quezon City: University of the Philippines Press, 490. {{ISBN|971-542-357-4}}. &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Postdevelopment theory''' (also '''post-development''' or '''anti-development''' or '''development criticism''') holds that the whole concept and practice of [[regional development|development]] is a reflection of Western-Northern hegemony over the rest of the world. Postdevelopment thought arose in the 1980s out of criticisms voiced against development projects and [[development theory]], which justified them.

==Development as ideology==
The postdevelopment critique holds that modern [[development theory]] is a creation of academia in tandem with an underlying political and economic ideology. The academic, political, and economic nature of development means it tends to be policy oriented, problem-driven, and therefore effective only in terms of and in relation to a particular, pre-existing social theory.

The actual development projects thus initiated, by both governments and NGOs, are directed in accordance with this development theory. Development theory itself, however, assumes a framework already set in place by government and political culture in order to implement it. The development process is therefore ''socially constructed''; Western interests are guiding its direction and outcome, and so development itself fundamentally reflects the pattern of Western hegemony.

Development as an ideology and a social vision is ingrained in the ideals of modernization, which holds western economic structure and society as a universal model for others to follow and emulate. Rooted in western influence, the developmental discourse reflects the unequal power relations between the west and the rest of the world, whereby the western knowledge of development, approach toward development, and conception of what development entails, as well as perceptions of progress, directs the course for the rest of the world.

==Reviewing development==
Influenced by [[Ivan Illich]] and other critics of colonialism and postcolonialism, a number of post-development theorists like [[Arturo Escobar (anthropologist)|Arturo Escobar]] and [[Gustavo Esteva]] have challenged the very meaning of development. According to them, the way we understand development is rooted in the earlier colonial discourse that depicts the North as "advanced" and "progressive", and the South as "backward", "degenerate" and "primitive".

They point out that a new way of thinking about development began in 1949 with President [[Harry Truman]]'s declaration: "The old imperialism—exploitation for foreign profit—has no place in our plans. What we envisage is a program of development based on the concepts of democratic fair dealings."
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Truman Inaugural Address, January 20, 1949|url=https://www.trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/50yr_archive/inagural20jan1949.htm|website=Harry S. Truman Presidential Library &amp; Museum|accessdate=6 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
While claiming that the "era of development" began at this point, post development theorists do not suggest that the concept of development was new. What ''was'' new was the definition of  development in terms of an escape from [[underdevelopment]]. Since the latter referred to two-thirds of the world, this meant that most societies were made to see themselves as having fallen into the undignified condition of "underdevelopment", and thus to look outside of their own cultures for salvation.

Development, according to these critics, was now a euphemism for post-war [[American hegemony]]; it was the ideals and development programs of the United States and its (Western) European allies that would form the basis of development everywhere else.

==Post-development theory==
Post-development theory arose in the 1980s and 1990s through the works of scholars like [[Arturo Escobar (anthropologist)|Arturo Escobar]], [[Gustavo Esteva]], [[Majid Rahnema]], [[Wolfgang Sachs]], [[James Ferguson (anthropologist)|James Ferguson]], [[Serge Latouche]], and [[Gilbert Rist]]. Leading members of the post-development school argue that development was always unjust, never worked, and at this point has clearly failed. According to [[Wolfgang Sachs]], a leading member of the post-development school, "the idea of development stands like a ruin in the intellectual landscape" and "it is time to dismantle this mental structure."&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Sachs, "Introduction" in Sachs 1992: 1-5, citation p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

To cite an example of this "mental structure", development theorists point out how the concept of development has resulted in the hierarchy of developed and underdeveloped nations, where the developed nations are seen as more advanced and superior to the underdeveloped nations that are conceived as inferior, in need of help from the developed nations, and desiring to be like the developed nations. The post-development school of thought points out that the models of development are often ethnocentric (in this case Eurocentric), universalist, and based on western models of industrialization that are unsustainable in this world of limited resources and ineffective for their ignorance of the local, cultural and historical contexts of the peoples to which they are applied. In essence, the problem post-development theorists see in development and its practice is an imbalance of influence or domination by the west. Post development theorists promote more pluralism in ideas about development.

===Critique of ethnocentrism and universalism===
Among the starting points and basic assumptions of post-development thought is the idea that a middle-class, Western lifestyle and all that goes with it (which might include the nuclear family, mass consumption, living in suburbia and extensive private space), may neither be a realistic nor a desirable goal for the majority of the world's population. In this sense, development is seen as requiring the loss, or indeed the deliberate extermination (ethnocide)  of indigenous culture&lt;ref&gt;''Ancient Futures: learning from Ladakh'' by Helena Norberg-Hodge. Sierra Club Books, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; or other psychologically and environmentally rich and rewarding modes of life. As a result, formerly satisfactory ways of life become dissatisfying because development changes people's perception of themselves.

[[Majid Rahnema]] cites [[Helena Norberg-Hodge]]: "To take an example, Helena Norberg-Hodge mentions how the notion of poverty hardly existed in [[Ladakh]] when she visited that country for the first time in 1975. Today she says, it has become part of the language. When visiting an outlying village some eight years ago, Helena asked a young Ladakhi where were the poorest houses. 'We have no poor houses in our village,' was the proud reply. Recently Helena saw the same Ladakhi talking to an American tourist and overheard him say, 'if only you could do something for us, we are so poor.'"&lt;ref&gt;Majid Rahnema, "Poverty" in: Sachs 1992: 158-176, citation p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Majid Rahnema also refers to Peter Bunyard, "Can Self-sufficient Communities survive the onslaught of Development?", The Ecologist, Vol. 14, 1984, p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

Development is seen as a set of knowledges, interventions and worldviews (in short, discourses) which are also powers: to intervene, to transform and to rule.  Post-development critiques challenge the notion of a single path to development and demands acknowledgment of diversity of cultural perspectives and priorities.

For example, the politics of defining and satisfying [[needs]] is a crucial dimension of development thought, deeply entwined in the concept of [[agency (sociology)|agency]]. But who voices development concerns, what power relations are played out, how do the interests of development "experts" (the [[World Bank]], IMF officials, professionals, and so on) rule the development priorities, and which voices are excluded as a result? The post-development approach attempts to overcome the inequality of this discourse by opening up spaces for non-Western peoples and their concerns.

Postdevelopment theory is, above all, a critique of the standard assumptions about progress: who possesses the key to it and how it may be implemented.

===Alternatives to development===
While the postdevelopment school provides a plethora of development critiques, it also considers alternative methods for bringing about positive change. The postdevelopment school proposes a particular vision of society removed from the discourse of development, modernity, politics, cultural and economic influences from the west, and market oriented and centralized authoritarian societies.

In his works, [[Arturo Escobar (anthropologist)|Escobar]] has outlined the common features of post-development thought and societal vision. According to Escobar, the post-development school of thought is interested (in terms of searching for an alternative to development) in "local culture and knowledge; a critical stance toward established scientific discourses; and the defense and promotion of localized, pluralistic grassroots movements." Grassroots movements, Escobar argues, are "local, pluralistic, and distrust organized politics and development establishment." ([https://books.google.at/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=M0NRDwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PT7&amp;dq=arturo+escobar+designs+for+the+pluriverse&amp;ots=NzHTavKElr&amp;sig=4ypQm3eI3YI89k-4LshndRAXp7E&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=arturo%20escobar%20designs%20for%20the%20pluriverse&amp;f=false Escobar, 2017])

Post-development thought takes inspiration from vernacular societies, the informal sector and frugal rather than materialistic lifestyles. Furthermore, post-development theorists advocate for structural changes. According to Escobar, post-developmental thinking believes that the economy must be based around solidarity and reciprocity; policy must focus on direct democracy; and knowledge systems should be traditional, or at least a hybrid of modern and traditional knowledge.

===James Ferguson===
{{Further|James Ferguson (anthropologist)}}
One of the leading anti-development writers, James Ferguson contributed to what John Rapley termed "the most important of the opening salvos" of post-development theory with his book ''The Anti-Politics Machine: Development, Depoliticization, and Bureaucratic Power in Lesotho''. In ''The Anti-Politics Machine'' Ferguson describes the failure of the development project to properly understand the cultural and economic values of the people of Lesotho. This misunderstanding led to misappropriation of resources by the international community and myriad negative consequences for Basotho (residents of Lesotho), prompting Ferguson to comment that "Capitalist interests [...] can only operate through a set of social and cultural structures so complex that the outcome may be only a baroque and unrecognizable transformation of the original intention."&lt;ref name="Anti-Politics"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ferguson|first=James|title=The Anti-Politics Machine: Development, Depoliticization, and Bureacratic Power in Lesotho|journal=The Ecologist|date=September–October 1994|volume=24|issue=5|pages=176–181|url=http://exacteditions.theecologist.org/read/resurgence/ecologist-vol-24-no-5-sep-oct-1994-6241/18/3|accessdate=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Development projects cannot simply create a desired result, but instead have a number of unexpected consequences.

Ferguson suggests that although development projects often end in failure, they still produce tangible impacts in the physical and social-political environment. In ''The Anti-Politics Machine'', he asks, "What do aid programs do besides fail to help poor people?"&lt;ref name="Anti-Politics"/&gt; In the case of Lesotho, Ferguson proposes that, "while the project did not transform livestock-keeping it did build a road to link to Thaba-Tsea more strongly with the capital."&lt;ref name="Anti-Politics"/&gt; Ferguson argues that there is value to understanding and thinking about the [[unintended consequences]] for an environment.

===Arturo Escobar===
{{Further|Arturo Escobar (anthropologist)}}
Critics of development do not deny the need for change. They argue instead that to enact proper and effective change, change itself must first be conceived in different terms. Arturo Escobar, another leading member of the post-development school, argues:

&lt;blockquote&gt;While social change has probably always been part of the human experience, it was only within the European modernity that 'society', i.e. the whole way of life of a people, was open to empirical analysis and made the subject of planned change. And while communities in the Third World may find that there is a need for some sort of organised or directed change—in part to reverse the damage done by development—this undoubtedly will not take the form of 'designing life' or social engineering. In this long run, this means that categories and meanings have to be redefined; through their innovative political practice, new social movements of various kinds are already embarked on this process of redefining the social, and knowledge itself.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Majid Rahnema===
{{Further|Majid Rahnema}}
Majid Rahnema addresses the question of which path to take directly in his conclusion to the ''Post-Development Reader''. Rahnema admits that it may be true that a large majority of people, whose lives are in fact difficult, do want change. But the answer he suggests is not development but the "end of development". He says that the end of development is not "An end to the search for new possibilities of change, for a relational world of friendship, or for genuine processes of regeneration able to give birth to new forms of solidarity". Rather, Rahnema argues, the "inhumane and the ultimately destructive approach to change is over. It should resemble a call to the 'good people' everywhere to think and work together."{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

===Serge Latouche===
{{Further|Serge Latouche}}
Serge Latouche is a [[French people|French]] [[emeritus]] [[professor]] in economy at the [[University of Paris-Sud]]. A  specialist in North-South economic and cultural relations, and in social sciences epistemology, he has developed a critical theory towards economic orthodoxy. He denounces [[economism]], [[utilitarianism]] in social sciences, [[Consumerism|consumer society]] and the notion of [[sustainable development]]. He particularly criticizes the notions of [[economic efficiency]] and [[economic rationalism]]. He is one of the thinkers and most renowned partisans of the [[Degrowth|degrowth theory]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.solutionslocales-lefilm.com/en/characters/serge-latouche {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121231170033/http://www.solutionslocales-lefilm.com/en/characters/serge-latouche |date=December 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Latouche has also published in the [[Mouvement Anti-Utilitariste dans les Sciences Sociales|Revue de Mauss]], a French anti-utilitarian journal.

===Wolfgang Sachs and ''The Development Dictionary''===
{{Further|Wolfgang Sachs}}
Wolfgang Sachs is a leading writer in post-development thought. Most of his writing is focused on environmentally sustainable development and the idea that past notions of development are naturally unsustainable practices on our finite planet. However, in 1992 he co-authored and edited ''The Development Dictionary: A Guide to Knowledge as Power'' which contributed greatly to the compilation of post development literature as a general theory.

This manifesto posits that the new era of development that emerged in the 1950s was created by the United States in order to secure its new hegemonic position in the global community. Sachs explains that the concept of "underdevelopment" was actually constructed in [[Harry S. Truman's 1949 inaugural address]], which popularized the term. Sachs argues that the creation of this term was a discrete, strategic move to secure American hegemony by reinforcing the idea that the United States is at the top, and other countries on a lower pillar, of a linear and singular trajectory of development. It created a homogeneous identity for these countries and stripped them of their own diverse characteristics. "It converts participation into a manipulative trick to involve people in struggles for getting what the powerful want to impose on them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sachs|first=Wolfgang|title=The Development Dictionary: A Guide to Knowledge as Power|year=1992|publisher=Zed Books|isbn=978-1-85649-044-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Development Dictionary'' describes a biological metaphor for development. This biological metaphor was transferred to the social sphere and perpetuated the ideal that there is one natural way to develop into the perfect form. To develop in a manner disparate from the "natural order of things" was to become a disfigured anomaly. This definition held the potential to provide morally ambiguous justification for imperialist behavior and can be connected to colonial discourse and mainstream development theories. Under such categorization, Sachs explains, development was reduced to a simple measurement of the economic growth of per capita production.

Sachs issues a cry for public awareness of the "limits of development." He leaves the reader with the idea of the "New Commons" and posits that men and women should begin with this awareness before attempting to introduce new political policies with room for creativity and innovation in diverse development paths.

==Criticisms==

There is a large body of works which are critical of post-development theory and its proponents.  It has been noted that post-development theory sees all development as imposed upon the developing world by the West.  This dualist perspective of development may be unrealistic, and Marc Edelman notes that a large proportion of development has risen from, rather than been imposed upon, the developing world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Edelman|first=Marc|title=Peasants Against Globalization: Rural Social Movements in Costa Rica|year=1999|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, CA|isbn=978-0804734011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Citing Jonathan Crush's point that "Development, for all its power to speak and to control the terms of speaking, has never been impervious to challenge and resistance, nor, in response, to reformulation and change"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crush|first=Jonathan|title=Power of Development|year=1995|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-11176-8|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ray Kiely argues that "The post-development idea is thus part of a long history within the development discourse."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kiely|first=Ray|title=The Last Refuge of the Nohle Savage? A Critical Assessment of Post-Development Theory|journal=European Journal of Development Research|date=1 June 1999|volume=11|issue=1|pages=30–55|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=395bfdd5-ba80-4be4-a31c-e338a540617e%40sessionmgr114&amp;vid=2&amp;hid=108|accessdate=12 February 2013|doi=10.1080/09578819908426726}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In short, Kiely argues that post-development theory is merely the latest version of a set of criticisms that have long been evident within writing and thought in the field of development. Development has always been about choices, Kiely explains.  Choices with resulting losers and winners, dilemmas and destruction, as well as creative possibility.

There are a number of more fundamental objections to the postdevelopment school. The first is that it overstates its case. A rejection of ''all development'' is a rejection of the possibility for material advancement and transformation. It ignores the tangible transformations in life opportunities and health and material well-being that has been evident in parts of the developing world. Moreover, development itself is so varied and carries so many meanings that critiques need to be specific about their intention when they claim to be "post- development". By damning development all together, post-development theorists fail to notice the heterogeneity within development discourse. They categorize all development under the umbrella of Western hegemony, contradictively applying the same sort of essentialist generalization post-development theorists reject.

Critics also argue that post-development perpetuates cultural relativism: the idea that cultural beliefs and practices can be judged only by those who practice them. By accepting all cultural behaviors and beliefs as valid and rejecting a universal standard for living and understanding life, critics of post-development argue, post-development represents the opposite extreme of universalism, extreme relativism.  Such a relativist extreme, rather than besting extreme universalism, has equally dangerous implications.  John Rapley points out that "rejection of essentialism rests itself on an essentialist claim – namely, that all truth is constructed and arbitrary[...]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rapley|first=John|title=Development studies and the post-development critique|journal=Progress in Development Studies|date=1 October 2004|volume=4 | issue = 4|pages=350–354|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/218128258|accessdate=12 February 2013|doi=10.1191/1464993404ps095pr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kiely also argues that by rejecting a top-down, centralized approach to development and promoting development through local means, post-development thought perpetuates neo-liberal ideals. Kiely remarks that "The argument — upheld by [[Dependency theory|dependency]] and post-development theory — that the [[First World]] needs the [[Third World]], and vice versa, rehearses neo-liberal assumptions that the world is an equal playing field in which all nation states have the capacity to compete equally[...]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kiely|first=Ray|title=Development Theory and Industrialisation: Beyond the Impasse|journal=Journal of Contemporary Asia|year=1994|volume=24|issue=2|pages=133–160|doi=10.1080/00472339480000101}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, making locals responsible for their own predicament, post-development unintentionally agrees with neo-liberalist ideology that favors decentralized projects and ignores the possibility of assisting impoverished demographics, instead making the fallacious assumption that such demographics must succeed on their own initiative alone. Kiely notes that not all grassroots movements are progressive. Post-development is seen to empower anti-modern fundamentalists and traditionalists, who may hold non-progressive and oppressive values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kiely|first=Ray|title=The Last Refuge of the Noble Savage?

'''Promessa Organic''' [[Aktiebolag|AB]] is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] company with headquarters in [[Göteborg]], [[Sweden]]. The founder, [[biologist]] Susanne Wiigh-Mäsak has within this Company since 2001, and its Foundation  since 2005, tried to developing and providing a new form of [[ecological]] [[burial]], named promession, based on a patented biological concept and technical device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Swedes offer freeze-dry burials|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3473103.stm|work=[[BBC News]]|date=2004-02-09 |accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was liquidated in recent years - http://www.bohuslaningen.se/nyheter/orust/promessa-slutligen-i-konkurs-1.925619

The theory behind promession involves exposure to LIN (liquid nitrogen), a short mechanical vibration, turning the remains to a powder, thereafter [[freeze-drying]] and metal separation. It all takes place in a closed, fully automatized equipment, named Promator. The remains are after this preparation, placed in a specially designed [[biodegradeable]] casket, which is then buried in the top soil. A memorial tree, smaller plant or bush can be placed at the burial spot. Within a year, the contents have [[Decomposition|decomposed]] and turned into soil, nourishing the newly planted memorial. 

Promessa and Susanne Wiigh Masak have applied for several patents for the kind of processes described above but none of them were ever granted.  The applications are on Google patents and the reference numbers are CA2393368A1, US20060154356A1 and US20030008017A1.  One granted patent can be found in the name of Promessa and / or Susanne Wiigh Masak but it is not for the methods described in this article and it is not clear that it would work or be practicable on a human corpse - "Method and device for treating organic matter" EP20000983635.  

There is no reference anywhere to be found on the worldwide web at the current time to a Promator having been sold or being in use anywhere in the world yet.  The technical proof of concept referred to above is not published anywhere. There is no data supplied by Promessa / Susanne Wiigh Masak as to the amount of force needed for the "short mechanical vibration" to reduce a human corpse frozen in liquid nitrogen to -196C to dust. It would most likely be considerable and prolonged if one takes a look at this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6giz8Kjf3gk .  

Several corpses were kept in deep freezers in anticipation of a promator in Jonkoping, Sweden, but it never happened.  https://www.jp.se/article/tva-nedfrysta-kroppar-kvar/

'''Rural history''' is an [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] field of historical research which focuses on the history of rural societies. At its inception, the field focused on the [[economic history]] of agriculture. Since the 1980s it has become increasingly influenced by [[social history]]. It can be considered an equivalent of [[urban history]].

A number of [[academic journal]]s and [[learned society|learned societies]] exist to promote rural history.

==History==
Rural history emerged as a distinct discipline from [[History of agriculture|Agricultural history]] in the 1980s and was inspired by the French [[Annales school|''Annales'' school]] which favoured integrating economic, social and political history.{{sfn|Burchardt|2007|p=469}} Initially focused predominantly on the social history of rural life and later became increasingly interested in [[cultural history]].{{sfn|Burchardt|2007|p=477}}

In [[Europe]], the study of rural history is supported by the European Rural History Organisation (ERHO).

==National studies==

===Britain===
Burchardt (2007) evaluates the state of English rural history and focuses on  an "orthodox" school dealing chiefly with the economic history of agriculture. The orthodox historians made "impressive progress" in quantifying and explaining the growth of output and productivity since the agricultural revolution. A challenge came from a dissident tradition that looked chiefly at the negative social costs of agricultural progress, especially enclosure. In the late 20th century there arose a new school, associated with the journal ''Rural History''. Led by Alun Howkins,&lt;ref&gt;Alun Howkins, ''Death of Rural England: A Social History of the Countryside since 1900'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; it links rural Britain to a wider social history. Burchardt calls for a new countryside history, paying more attention to the cultural and representational aspects that shaped 20th-century rural life.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Burchardt, "Agricultural History, Rural History, or Countryside History?" ''Historical Journal'' 2007 50(2): 465-481&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
[[File:03 sendia.jpg|thumb|Farmers from the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]]]]
{{main|History of agriculture in the United States}}
In the U.S. most rural history has focused on the South—overwhelmingly rural until the 1950s—but there is a "new rural history" of the North as well. Instead of becoming agrarian capitalists, farmers held onto preindustrial capitalist values emphasizing family and community. Rural areas maintained population stability; kinship ties determined rural immigrant settlement and community structures; and the defeminization of farm work encouraged the rural version of the "women's sphere." These findings strongly contrast with those in the old [[Frontier Thesis|frontier history]] as well as those found in the new urban history.&lt;ref&gt;Hal S. Barron, "Rediscovering the Majority: The New Rural History  of the Nineteenth-Century North," ''Historical Methods,'' Fall 1986, Vol. 19 Issue 4, pp 141-152&lt;/ref&gt;

Modernization came in the 20th century, with the arrival of mechanization, the model T, and the agricultural agent—as well as radio.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Craig, ''Out of the Dark: A History of Radio and Rural America'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
Rural history has been a major specialty of French scholars since the 1920s, thanks especially to the central role of the [[Annales School]].  Its journal ''Annales'' focuses attention on the synthesizing of historical patterns identified from social, economic, and cultural history, statistics, medical reports, family studies, and even psychoanalysis.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Burke, ''The French Historical Revolution: The Annales School 1929–89'' (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specialised journals==
A number of [[academic journal]]s exist with a specific focus on rural history. These include:

*''[[Agricultural History (journal)|Agricultural History]]'' (1927–). United States.
*''[[Agricultural History Review]]'' (1953–). United Kingdom.
*''[[Histoire &amp; Sociétés Rurales]]'' (1990–). France.
*''[[Rural History (journal)|Rural History. Economy, Society, Culture.]]'' (1990–). United Kingdom.

A '''sky lantern''' ({{zh|t={{linktext|天燈}}|s={{linktext|天灯}}|p=tiāndēng}}), also known as '''Kongming lantern''' or '''Chinese lantern''', is a small [[hot air balloon]] made of paper, with an opening at the bottom where a small fire is suspended.

In Asia and elsewhere around the world, sky lanterns have been traditionally made for centuries, to be launched for play or as part of long-established festivities. The name ''sky lantern'' is a translation of the [[Standard Chinese|Chinese]] name but they have also been referred to as ''sky candles'' or ''fire balloons''.

== Construction ==
 [[File:GloboCantolla77.JPG|thumb|180px|Making sky lanterns in Mexico]]
The general design is a thin paper shell, which may be from about 30 [[centimetre|cm]] to a couple of [[metre]]s across, with an opening at the bottom. The opening is usually about 10 to 30&amp;nbsp;cm wide (even for the largest shells), and is surrounded by a stiff collar that serves to suspend the [[flame]] source and to keep it away from the walls.

When lit, the [[flame]] heats the air inside the lantern, thus lowering its density and causing the lantern to rise into the air. The sky lantern is only airborne for as long as the flame stays alight, after which the lantern sinks back to the ground.

* In [[Mainland China]] and [[Taiwan]], sky lanterns are traditionally made from oiled [[rice paper]] on a [[bamboo]] frame. The source of hot air may be a small [[candle]] or fuel cell composed of a waxy [[flammable]] material.
* In [[Thailand]], sky lanterns are often traditionally made from oiled [[rice paper]] on a [[bamboo]] frame. They may also be constructed from other lightweight papers. The source of hot air is usually a small [[candle]] or fuel cell composed of a waxy [[flammable]] material lit and which usually stays lit despite the surrounding air currents. The Thai name is khom loi. Many areas of Asia, however, do not permit sky lanterns because of widespread fire hazards as well as danger to livestock.
* In Brazil, [[Mexico]], and possibly other [[Latin America]]n countries, sky lanterns were traditionally made of several patches of thin translucent paper (locally called "silk paper"), in various bright colors, glued together to make a multicolored [[polyhedron|polyhedral]] shell. A design that was fairly common was two pyramids joined by the base (a [[bipyramid]], such as the [[octahedron]]) sometimes with a [[cube]] or [[prism (geometry)|prism]] inserted in the middle. Only the smaller models had a full frame made of bamboo or thin wire; the slight overpressure of the hot air was sufficient to keep the larger ones inflated, and the frame was reduced to a wire loop around the bottom opening. The "candle" was usually a packet of [[paraffin wax|paraffin]] or [[rosin]] tightly wrapped in cloth and bound with wire.

== History ==
According to the [[sinologist]] and [[historian of science]] [[Joseph Needham]], the Chinese experimented with small [[hot air balloon]]s for signaling from as early as the [[3rd century BC|3rd century BCE]], during the [[Warring States period]].  Traditionally, however, their invention is attributed to the sage and military strategist [[Zhuge Liang]] (181–234 CE),&lt;ref name="deng" /&gt; whose [[Chinese style name|reverent term of address]] was Kongming. He is said to have used a message written on a sky lantern to summon help on an occasion when he was surrounded by enemy troops. For this reason, they are still known in China as Kongming lanterns ({{linktext|孔明燈}}, {{linktext|孔|明|灯}}, ''kǒngmíng dēng''). Another suggested origin is that the name actually comes from the lantern's resemblance to the hat Kongming is traditionally shown to be wearing.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Sky lanterns could be a possible explanation for some [[unidentified flying object|UFO]] sightings through the years.&lt;ref name=speigel /&gt;&lt;ref name=scrib /&gt;

== Usage in festivals ==

=== China ===
In ancient China, sky lanterns were strategically used in wars, in a similar way as [[kites]] were used in ancient Chinese warfare, such as military communication (transmitting secret messages), signaling, surveillance or spying, lighting the sky when laying siege on the city at night etc.  However, later on, non-military applications were employed as they became popular with [[children]] at festivals. These lanterns were subsequently incorporated into festivals like the Chinese [[Mid-Autumn]] and [[Lantern Festival]]s.

=== India ===
To represent the [[Star of Bethlehem]] during [[Christmas]] season, as part of celebrations sky lanterns are released into the night sky with hopes towards a new year.
In Bengal and [[Northeast India]], Buddhist people celebrate their Probarona Purnima which signifies end of their three-month lent by releasing lighted sky lanterns (''fanush''), it is the second largest festival of the Buddhist community. During [[Diwali]] festival (The festival of Light) eco-friendly sky lanterns are used for celebrations along with fireworks.

=== Portugal and Brazil ===
[[File:GloboCantolla34.JPG|thumb|180px|Releasing a sky lantern in Mexico.]]
In [[Brazil]], sky lanterns (''balão'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]) were a traditional feature of the [[Festa Junina|winter holidays]] (''Festas Juninas'') at the end of June. It is claimed that custom was brought to Brazil from [[Portugal]] by colonists in the 16th century, and is still strong in Portugal, especially in [[Porto]]. The June holidays tradition also includes [[firecracker]]s and [[firework]]s, another Chinese invention; so it is conjectured that these elements may have been brought from China by Portuguese explorers around 1500. The design and customs of Brazilian sky lanterns are modified to suit their festivals.

[[Bartolomeu de Gusmão]], using a large scale version of these lanterns, was the first man to fly a [[hot air balloon]] in 8 August 1709, in the hall of the [[Casa da Índia]] in Lisbon, Portugal, long before the [[Montgolfier brothers]].

Brazilian sky lanterns are usually made by small groups of children and adolescents; but adults sometimes joined the effort, especially for the larger and more elaborate balloons. The launching of a large lantern, which could be one or two [[metre]]s across, would usually require the cooperation of several people, to hold the balloon fully stretched until it was fully inflated. Lanterns with 20 meters or more and loaded with firecrackers and large flags are not uncommon. It is important to note that launching lanterns in Brazil is an environmental crime, punishable by up to 3 years in jail since 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www12.senado.leg.br/cidadania/edicoes/262/fabricar-vender-ou-soltar-baloes-que-possam-provocar-incendio-e-crime|title=Fabricar, vender ou soltar balões que possam provocar incêndio é crime — Especial Cidadania - Jornal do Senado|website=www12.senado.leg.br|language=pt-br|access-date=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Taiwan ===
[[Pingxi District]] in [[New Taipei City]] of [[Taiwan]] holds an annual Lantern Festival in which sky lanterns are released into the night sky with people's wishes written, to send the wishes and messages to God. Lantern Festival is also as known as the 15th days of Lunar New Year, the last day of celebration for Lunar New Year.

=== Thailand ===
[[File:LK 03 loy krathong yi peng san sai.jpg|thumb|180px|Release of a sky lantern during Yi Peng near [[Chiang Mai]], [[Thailand]]]]
The [[Lanna]] people of northern [[Thailand]] use "floating lanterns" ({{linktext|โคมลอย}}, ''khom loi'') year round, for celebrations and other special occasions. One very important festival in which sky lanterns are used is the Yi Peng festival, which is held on a full moon of the 2nd month ({{linktext|ยี่เป็ง}}, ''Yi Peng'') of the Lanna calendar (which coincides with [[Loi Krathong]], the traditional festival on the 12th month of the Thai lunar calendar). During the Yi Peng festival, a multitude of lanterns are launched into the air where they resemble large flocks of giant fluorescent jellyfish gracefully floating by through the sky. The most elaborate ''Yi Peng'' celebrations can be seen in [[Chiang Mai]],&lt;ref name="chiangmai-chiangrai" /&gt; the ancient capital of the former Lanna kingdom. The festival is meant as a time to obtain [[merit (Buddhism)|Buddhist merit]] ({{linktext|ทำบุญ}}, ''tham bun''). In recent times, floating lanterns have become so popular with all Thai people that they have become integrated into the festival in the rest of the country.

In addition, people will also decorate their houses, gardens and temples with intricately shaped paper lanterns ({{linktext|โคม|ไฟ}}, ''khom fai'') of various forms. It is considered good luck to release a sky lantern, and many Thais believe they are symbolic of problems and worries floating away.

== Dangers ==
[[File:Chinese lantern at Muir of Dinnet national nature reserve 2- CR-IMG 1616 1.jpg|thumb|Sky lantern litter at [[Scottish Natural Heritage]]'s [[Muir of Dinnet]] national nature reserve]]

A sky lantern may land when the flame is still alight, making it a [[fire hazard]].&lt;ref name=pneus /&gt; In typical designs, as long as the lantern stays upright the paper will not get hot enough to ignite, but if the balloon is tilted (say, by the wind or by hitting some object), it may catch fire while still in the air.  All the paper will usually burn in a few seconds, but the flame source may remain lit until it hits the ground.

After the balloon lands, the leftover thin wire frame will rust away very slowly, remaining a hazard to animals that may swallow it.&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt;  In 2009 British company Sky Orbs Chinese Lanterns developed lanterns with a [[biodegradation|bio-degradable]] fireproof rope in place of metal wire.&lt;ref name="menmedia2" /&gt; Many other European manufacturers adopted similar designs. In 2012 the same company released a patented design with fireproof base following reports of fires caused by lanterns.&lt;ref name="menmedia" /&gt;

Sky lanterns have also been alleged to pose a danger to aircraft.&lt;ref name=cumbic /&gt;

On 1 July 2013 the '[[Smethwick fire 2013|largest fire ever]]' in the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] of England, involving 100,000 tonnes of recycling material and causing an estimated six million pounds worth of damage, was started by a sky lantern which landed at a plastics recycling plant in [[Smethwick]]. Images of the lantern starting the fire were captured on CCTV.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.itv.com/news/story/2013-07-01/major-blaze-at-recycling-plant-smethwick-west-midlands&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-23123549&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the fire, [[Poundland]] decided to stop selling sky lanterns and recalled their entire stock on 6 July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/07/06/chinese-lanterns-poundland_n_3554177.html Poundland Stops Selling Chinese Lanterns After Massive Fire In Smethwick]". [[Huffington Post]]. 2013-07-06. Retrieved 2013-07-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 a pavilion at [[Riocentro]] Convention Center, near downtown [[Rio de Janeiro, Brazil]], fully burned after a sky balloon landed on its roof.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/01/fields-medal-award-stolen-brazil-maths-prize&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legal status ===

Despite their use for centuries, there has been growing concern by some about the potential danger to cause crop or building fires and even harm animals that may eat their remains. Despite the general lack of prevalence some places have banned them for these reasons.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;

The city of [[Sanya]] in [[People's Republic of China|China]] banned sky lanterns due to their hazards toward aircraft and airspace navigation.&lt;ref name="abc" /&gt;

It is illegal to launch a sky lantern in most parts of [[Germany]]; where use is not illegal, as in [[Herford (district)|Herford]], it is necessary to obtain advance permission from local authorities. In [[Austria]], it is illegal to produce, sell, import, or distribute them.&lt;ref name="ris.bka.gv" /&gt; In Argentina, Chile, and Colombia it is illegal to launch lanterns, as well as in Spain and Vietnam. In Brazil launching lanterns is an environmental crime, punishable by up to 3 years in jail since 1998.&lt;ref name=cumbic/&gt;

Retail sale (but not possession and use) of sky lanterns that "rely on an open flame to heat the air inside the lantern" was banned in Australia on 1 February 2011.&lt;ref name="Aus_ban_1Feb2011" /&gt;

Sky Lanterns have also been banned in [[Kittitas County, Washington]] due to fire concerns on 20 June 2013.&lt;ref name=mynorthwest/&gt; Since then, Washington state has banned sky lanterns statewide.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2655">The Japanese word '''‘sorei’''' (祖霊) refers to the [[Ancestor worship|spirits of ancestors]].
Specifically it refers to the spirits of those ancestors that have been the
target of special memorial services that have been held for them at certain
fixed times after their death.  The dates and the frequencies of these services
vary widely depending on the region of Japan.&lt;ref name="hendry"&gt;Hendry, 1995, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bernier"&gt;Bernier, 1985, pp. 68-69&lt;/ref&gt;  Suitable occasions may for example be 33 and 50 years after death.&lt;ref&gt;From the Japanese-Japanese part of the dictionary [http://dictionary.goo.ne.jp GOO] for 祖霊&lt;/ref&gt;

A special belief connected with ''sorei'' is the notion that the memorial
services result in the ancestral spirit successively losing its individuality,
eventually becoming an entirely deindividualized part of the collective of
''sorei''.&lt;ref name="hendry"&gt;Hendry, 1995, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; However, depending on the region people
may think that these services are merely aimed at properly disposing or
pacifying the ancestral spirit.&lt;ref name="bernier"&gt;Bernier, 1985, pp. 68-69&lt;/ref&gt;

The folklorist [[Yanagita Kunio]] has asserted that the rituals and
ideas around ''sorei'' could be fitted into a general scheme whereby
ancestors become not only protectors, but ''[[kami]]'' or ''[[ujigami]]''.
However, while it is possible that in the distant past such a development with
regard to certain ancestors has occurred, according to other scholars that
cannot be proven.&lt;ref name="bernier"&gt;Bernier, 1985, pp. 68-69&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary Japanese may, 
in relation to their recently dead, not think about the ancient notion of 
''ujigami''  at all, but they do have a notion about the spirits of the dead becoming
some sort of enlightened being. Indeed, another word for the departed soul is
in Japanese ''[[hotoke]]'', which also means Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;Reader, 1991, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sundance Institute''' is a [[non-profit]] organization founded by [[Robert Redford]] committed to the growth of independent artists. The Institute is driven by its programs that discover and support independent filmmakers, theatre artists and composers from all over the world. At the core of the programs is the goal to introduce audiences to the artists' new work, aided by the Institute's Labs, granting and mentorship programs that take place throughout the year in the United States and internationally.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/07/28/movies/29sundancefeature.html The New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute has offices in [[Park City, Utah|Park City]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[New York City]], and provides creative and financial support to emerging and aspiring filmmakers, directors, producers, film composers, screenwriters, playwrights and theatre artists through a series of Labs and fellowships. The programs of Sundance Institute include the [[Sundance Film Festival]], a notable and critically acclaimed film festival in the U.S. that serves as a platform for independent filmmakers, storytellers and composers.

The Sundance Institute's founding staff, assembled in the spring of 1980, included Executive Director [[Sterling Van Wagenen]], Director of Film Development Programs Jenny Walz Selby, and Director of Development Jon Lear. [[Frank Daniel]] was secured as Artistic Director.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/06/nyregion/frank-daniel-69-film-maker-who-fled-prague.html|title=Frank Daniel, 69, Film Maker Who Fled Prague|last=Gelder|first=Lawrence Van|date=1996-03-06|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-08-15|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; This staff produced the first Filmmakers Lab in June 1981, which fortuitously followed the [[wikipedia:Academy_Awards|Academy Awards]] at which ''[[Ordinary People]]'' (the directorial debut of Robert Redford) won numerous awards, including Best Picture. Michelle Satter joined the staff in June 1981 and subsequently opened up the Los Angeles office of the Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2002/scene/markets-festivals/michelle-satter-1117870407/|title=Michelle Satter|last=Staff|first=Variety|date=2002-07-29|work=Variety|access-date=2017-08-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sundance Institute's 1981 founding Board of Trustees included Robert Redford, Sterling VanWagenen, Robert E. Gipson, Ian Calderon, Robert Geller, George White, Irving Azoff, [[Saul Bass]], Ian Cumming, Frank Daniel, Christopher Dodd, [[Moctesuma Esparza]], Dr. Robert Gray, [[Alan Jacobs]], Karl Malden, Mary McFadden, [[Mike Medavoy]], [[Victor Nuñez|Victor Nunez]], Wayne Owens, [[Sydney Pollack]], Gilbert Shelton, [[Annick Smith]], Anthony Thomopoulos, Claire Townsend, and Robert Townsend. The first six listed were also members of the executive committee.

In 1985, the Sundance Institute assumed management of the fledgling United States Film Festival, which had been experiencing financial problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1956952,00.html|title=Sundance Film Festival|last=Friedman|first=Megan|date=2010-01-27|work=Time|access-date=2017-08-15|language=en-US|issn=0040-781X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute hired Tony Safford from the AFI Kennedy Center program as Managing Director and renamed the festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thefilmstage.com/features/becoming-sundance-the-development-of-america%E2%80%99s-premiere-film-festival/|title=Becoming Sundance: The Development of America's Premiere Film Festival|date=2010-06-12|work=The Film Stage|access-date=2017-08-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute started off with its Feature Film Program and Film Music Program (revived later in 1994) in the 1980s, then went on to include other programs such as the Native American and Indigenous Film Program in 1994, the Theatre Program in 1997, the Documentary Film Program in 2002, the New Frontier program in 2007, the Creative Producing Initiative in 2008, the Episodic Storytelling Initiative in 2014, Sundance Ignite, a program for young filmmakers, in 2015, and the Creative Distribution Initiative (an extension of the Creative Producing Initiative) in 2017.

At the U.S. Film Festival, after Sundance Institute took over in 1985, there were 85 films shown at two theatres in Park City with a staff of 13. In January 2017 at the present-day Sundance Film Festival, 181 films were shown at nine Park City theatres with a staff of 224 and 71,600 attendees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sundance.org/festivalhistory|title=33 Years of Sundance Film Festival - Sundance Institute|website=www.sundance.org|access-date=2017-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sundance Institute Programs==

===Feature Film Program===
For three weeks each June in Sundance, Utah, Directors Lab Fellows rehearse, shoot and edit four to six scenes from their screenplays under the mentorship of accomplished directors, editors, cinematographers and actors who serve as Creative Advisors.

In addition to the creative support offered through Labs and workshops, Sundance Institute helps independent filmmakers complete their work through various grants and fellowships. Many of these opportunities are designated for filmmakers selected to participate in the Institute's Feature Film Program.

===Film Music Program===
The Sundance Institute Composers Lab, held every summer at the [[Skywalker Sound]] studio in [[Marin County, California|Marin County]], [[California]], aims to enhance the role of music in independent film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://soundtrackfest.com/en/news/sundance-institute-composers-lab-deadline/|title=Sundance Institute Composers Lab deadline|last=|first=|date=March 30, 2017|website=SoundTrackFest|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwtv/article/Sundance-Institute-and-Skywalker-Sound-Announce-Composers-Directors-for-2017-Music-Sound-Design-Labs-20170705#|title=Sundance Institute and Skywalker Sound Announce Composers, Directors for 2017 Music &amp; Sound Design Labs|last=Desk|first=Movies News|access-date=2017-08-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwmusic/article/BMI-Continues-Support-of-Sundance-Institute-Film-Music-Program-20170705|title=BMI Continues Support of Sundance Institute Film Music Program|last=Desk|first=BWW News|access-date=2017-08-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Composers Lab Alumni include Bijan Olia, Cindy O'Connor, Sergei Stern, Jackson Greenberg, Camilla Uboldi, Jesi Nelson, [[Adam Schoenberg]], Rebecca Dale, Ryan Rumery, and Darryl Jones.

Composers Lab Advisors in 2017 include [[Harry Gregson-Williams]], [[Thomas Newman]], James Howard, [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]], [[Miriam Cutler]], [[Laura Karpman]], Doreen Ringer-Ross, Christopher Beck, [[Todd Boekelheide]], [[Dennis Leonard (sound editor)|Dennis Leonard]], Bob Edwards, Pete Horner, Malcolm Fife, Bonnie Wild, David Accord, Adam Smalley, Miguel Arteta, Robb Moss, [[Amir Bar-Lev]], Toby Shimin and Jon Burlingame.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwmusic/article/BMI-Continues-Support-of-Sundance-Institute-Film-Music-Program-20170705|title=BMI Continues Support of Sundance Institute Film Music Program|last=Desk|first=BWW News|access-date=2017-08-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Music Cafe is a night club venue for rock, singer-songwriters, folk, country, and hip hop on Main Street in Park City during the Sundance Film Festival. Music Cafe daytime programming, produced by ASCAP, has featured such artists as [[India.Arie]], [[Peter Gabriel]], [[The Black Eyed Peas]], [[Suzanne Vega]], Sweet Pea Atkinson, [[Was (Not Was)]] and many others.

=== Native American and Indigenous Film Program ===
The Native American and Indigenous Film Program facilitates the participation of Native and Indigenous artists in the Institute's artistic development programs and the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. To date, the Initiative has facilitated the participation of many Native artists into the Sundance Film Festival, the Independent Producers Conference, and the Institute's Feature Film Program. In 2008 the Initiative expanded its focus to include outreach to documentarians, theatre artists, and musicians seeking financial and creative support through the Sundance Institute Documentary Fund, the Theatre Program, and the Film Music Program. The Sundance Film Festival provides a world stage for compelling and innovative films by Native American and Indigenous filmmakers. The Festival also hosts the annual Native Forum, a program of panel discussions, filmmaker workshops, and networking events that provide opportunities for indigenous filmmakers to share their expertise and knowledge with each other and the larger independent film community. The Native American and Indigenous Program is supported by the [[W. K. Kellogg Foundation|W.K. Kellogg Foundation]], [[Surdna Foundation]], Time Warner Foundation, [[Ford Foundation]], [[Native Arts and Cultures Foundation]], [[Screen Actors Guild|SAGindie]], Comcast-NBCUniversal, the [[John S. and James L. Knight Foundation]], [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]], the Embassy of Australia, Indigenous Media Initiatives, [[Taika Waititi]], The White Feather Foundation, Fenton Bailey and [[Billy Luther]], and Pacific Islanders in Communications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://indiancountrymedianetwork.com/culture/arts-entertainment/11-sundance-native-filmmaker-fellowships-2017/|title=11 Sundance Native Filmmaker Fellowships for 2017 - Indian Country Media Network|website=indiancountrymedianetwork.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1994 to 2004, the Film Festival presented Native films as part a dedicated screening category. The Festival began incorporating Native and Indigenous films into its official film program in 2005.

Over the course of its history, the Sundance Film Festival has showcased a range of work by Native and Indigenous filmmakers including dramatic films like Sterlin Harjo's ''[[Four Sheets to the Wind]]'', [[Sherman Alexie]]'s ''[[The Business of Fancydancing]]'', [[Chris Eyre]]'s ''[[Smoke Signals (film)|Smoke Signals]]'', [[Rachel Perkins]]' ''[[One Night the Moon]]'', and Willi White's ''Miye, Unkiye;'' documentaries such as [[Heather Rae]]'s ''[[Trudell]]'', Tom Murray and Allan Collins' ''Dhakiyarr vs. the King'', and [[Merata Mita]]'s ''Hotere;'' and short films like Gabriel Lopez-Shaw and [[Sherwin Bitsui]]'s ''Chrysalis'', [[Taika Waititi]]'s ''[[Two Cars, One Night]],'' and Shane McSauby's ''Mino Bimaadiziwin''.

===Theatre Program===
The Theatre Program, under the direction of Philip Himberg, supports the development of independent theatre. Lab Alumni and projects include [[Tanya Barfield]]'s ''Blue Door'', [[Adam Guettel]] and [[Craig Lucas]]' ''[[The Light in the Piazza (musical)|The Light in the Piazza]]'', [[Lisa Kron]]'s ''[[Well (play)|Well]]'', [[Jessica Hagedorn]]'s ''[[Dogeaters]]'', [[Stew (musician)|Stew]]'s ''[[Passing Strange]]'', [[Steven Sater]] and [[Duncan Sheik]]'s ''[[Spring Awakening (play)|Spring Awakening]]'', [[Moisés Kaufman]]'s ''[[The Laramie Project]],'' [[Doug Wright]]'s ''[[I Am My Own Wife]],'' [[Darko Tresnjak]]'s ''[[A Gentleman's Guide to Love and Murder|A Gentleman's Guide to Love and Murder]],'' and [[Lisa Kron]] and [[Jeanine Tesori]]'s ''[[Fun Home (musical)|Fun Home]].''

The Theatre Labs take place at the Sundance Resort in Utah, other U.S. cities, and internationally. Projects rehearse every other day to give playwrights adequate time for rewrites. There is no physically controllable space, such as a 'black box.' Although lighting and scenic production values are not available, designers have sometimes participated as part of the development of the projects text. When a project is accepted into the Lab, it is assigned a Sundance dramaturg who, in collaboration with the Producing Artistic Director, will work with that project prior to the Theatre Lab residency period.

The Sundance Playwright's Retreat at [[Ucross, Wyoming]] is an eighteen-day writing colony where five playwrights and a composer convene each year and where a Sundance dramaturg can respond to work at an early stage of the creative process. Like the other two Labs, the Ucross Retreat includes both emerging and established artists.

Artists are selected by invitation only.

In May 2016, Sundance Institute had its first Theatre Lab in the [[MENA]] (Middle East and North Africa) region, in the Ourika Valley of [[Morocco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2016/legit/global/sundance-institute-launches-middle-east-theatre-lab-1201750167/|title=Sundance Institute Launches its First Theatre Lab in the Middle East|last=Vivarelli|first=Nick|date=2016-04-11|work=Variety|access-date=2017-08-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.americantheatre.org/2016/04/27/the-sundance-caravan-theatre-lab-sets-up-shop-in-morocco/|title=The Sundance Caravan: Theatre Lab Sets Up Shop in Morocco|last=Hart|first=Sarah|date=2016-04-27|website=AMERICAN THEATRE|access-date=2017-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Documentary Film Program===
The Sundance Documentary Film Program assists nonfiction filmmakers from around the world with a series of workshops in editing, storytelling, and scoring for documentary films as well as providing grants to nonfiction film projects through the Sundance Documentary Fund. The Sundance Institute Documentary Film Program provides year-round support to nonfiction contemporary-issue filmmakers internationally. The program encourages the exploration of innovative nonfiction storytelling, and promotes the exhibition of documentary films to a broader audience. It supports independent artists both domestically and internationally through the Sundance Documentary Fund, the Documentary Composers Laboratory and Edit and Story Laboratory, panels at the Filmmakers Lodge at the Sundance Film Festival and the Sundance Independent Producers Conference, and a variety of collaborative international documentary initiatives.

The Documentary Fund was established at Sundance Institute in 2002 with a gift from the [[Open Society Institute]] and is supported by a leadership grant from the [[Ford Foundation]]. 

Documentary Fund grants are announced once a year. In 2016, the Institute awarded over $1 million to artists for their documentary projects and global nonfiction storytelling.

=== New Frontier ===
Launched in 2007, the New Frontier Labs and residency programs foster the works of boundary-pushing artists and technologists, marked by its central themes of innovation and unconventionalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2010/09/toolkit-meet-the-sundance-film-festival-programmers-in-their-own-words-244985/|title=Toolkit {{!}} Meet the Sundance Film Festival Programmers (In their Own Words) {{!}} IndieWire|last=Brooks|first=Brian|website=www.indiewire.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New Frontier exhibition at Sundance Film Festival provides a curation of such works in the emerging field through the incorporation of fiction, non-fiction, and a mix of the two, to showcase transmedia storytelling, multimedia installations, performances and films.

At the [[2017 Sundance Film Festival]], the New Frontier lineup included the North American premiere of [[Jem Cohen]]'s film ''[[Museum Hours]]'' and documentary ''World Without End (No Reported Incidents)'', live multimedia performances, [[virtual reality]] segments, and immersive installations, among other projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/festivals/sundance-film-festival-2017-vr-new-frontier-lineup-1201930819/|title=Sundance Film Festival Embraces Virtual Reality With 2017 New Frontier Program|last=Debruge|first=Peter|date=2016-12-01|work=Variety|access-date=2017-08-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Creative Producing Initiative ===
Developed in 2008 as an initiative to support the next generation of independent producers, the Creative Producing Labs and fellowships is a 5-day long Lab that focuses on the producer as a whole. With the help of experienced advisors, Creative Producing Fellows have the chance to explore their own take on cinematic material and to equip themselves with the skills and experience necessary in the scripting and editing stages of a filmic piece. Past Creative Advisors include producers Anthony Bregman (''[[Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind]]''), [[Heather Rae]] (''Frozen River''), [[Mary Jane Skalski]] (''[[Mysterious Skin]]''), Jay Van Hoy (''[[American Honey (film)|American Honey]]''), and more.

Recent Creative Producing Fellows and their Feature Film works include Annie Silverstein's ''Bull'', Cesar Cervantes' ''Hot Clip'', Hannah Utt's ''Stupid Happy'', Nick Bentgen's ''Dey'Dey and his Brothers'', Gabriella Moses' ''Leche'', and Pippa Bianco's ''Share''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2016/07/sundance-institute-creative-film-producing-initiative-labs-fellowships-1201707107/|title=Sundance Institute: Creative Film Producing Initiative Projects Chosen {{!}} IndieWire|last=Murthi|first=Vikram|website=www.indiewire.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Episodic Storytelling Initiative ===
Initiated in 2014 as a result of the substantial growth of opportunities made present by the demand of more serial content for online and television platforms, the Episodic Storytelling Initiative gives writers the chance to refine their episodic-writing/producing skills. The Institute offers a year-round program of Episodic Story Labs for 10 writers (or co-writing teams) to work with accomplished [[Showrunner|showrunners]], non-writing creative producers, and studio and network executives.

According to the Institute's founder, Robert Redford, "Sundance Institute has always worked to develop and support a next generation of independent artists. As more of those artists look to the opportunities in television and online platforms, it is only natural that we expand our labs to address the unique needs of serialized work."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2014/tv/news/sundance-institute-to-launch-lab-for-tv-and-digital-series-1201138289/|title=Sundance Institute to Launch Lab for TV and Digital Series|last=Bacardi|first=Francesca|date=2014-03-19|work=Variety|access-date=2017-08-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sundance Ignite ===
Partnered with Adobe's Project 1324 contest, Sundance Ignite launched in 2015 as a short film challenge for young filmmakers ages 18 to 24.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nofilmschool.com/adobe-whats-next-short-film-contest-sundance-ignite-fellowships|title=Young Filmmakers: Get Into the Sundance Family with This Short Film Challenge|date=2016-09-02|work=No Film School|access-date=2017-08-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entrants can win the Ignite Ticket Package, which is an exclusive chance to see the newest films at the upcoming Sundance Film Festival, and the Ignite Fellows Program, a year-round Festival and industry experience. Sundance Ignite also puts on Ignite On Tour, a traveling component designed for the winners to engage with Institute staff and alumni.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2015/10/sundance-institute-is-looking-for-18-to-24-year-old-filmmakers-for-new-ignite-program-143011/|title=Sundance Institute Is Looking for 18-to-24-Year-Old Filmmakers for New Ignite Program {{!}} IndieWire|last=Obenson|first=Tambay A.|website=www.indiewire.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sundance Ignite program is supported by Adobe Project 1324, [[S. I. Newhouse School of Public Communications|S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications]], the College of Visual Performing Arts at [[Syracuse University]], and [[Chapman University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2015/10/sundance-institute-is-looking-for-18-to-24-year-old-filmmakers-for-new-ignite-program-143011/|title=Sundance Institute Is Looking for 18-to-24-Year-Old Filmmakers for New Ignite Program {{!}} IndieWire|last=Obenson|first=Tambay A.|website=www.indiewire.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Creative Distribution Initiative ===
The Creative Distribution Initiative (CDI), part of the Creative Producing Initiative, is the Institute's newest program inaugurated in 2017. Through online resources, workshops, and a network of organizations, CDI empowers filmmakers by teaching them the ever-changing ins and outs of what it takes to distribute and market independent film. For the Sundance Institute alumni, CDI also offers free consultations on [[Kickstarter]] campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://filmmakermagazine.com/102378-sundance-announces-new-creative-distribution-fellowship-with-columbus-unrest/#.WZNfgzsrI-W|title=Sundance Announces New Creative Distribution Fellowship with Columbus, Unrest {{!}} Filmmaker Magazine|last=Macaulay|first=Scott|work=Filmmaker Magazine|access-date=2017-08-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their first release under this initiative was the 2017 film ''[[Columbus (2017 film)|Columbus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sundance.org/case-studies/creative-distribution/columbus#/ Columbus Case Study|Sundance Institute]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sundance Collection at UCLA==
The Institute maintains the Sundance Collection at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] (University of California, Los Angeles) to conserve and archive the history of independent film. Film preservation is an especially pressing need in independent cinema. Despite their historical, artistic and cultural value, good prints of far too many indie films – even some made within the past decade – no longer exist. Chemical decomposition, neglect, and the changing ownership of film libraries have caused these prints to disappear.

To create a living record of the history of independent film, Sundance Institute and UCLA Film and Television Archive initiated the Sundance Collection at UCLA in 1997, and with contributions from studios and distributors as well as hundreds of individual filmmakers, the Collection's holdings have grown to include over 300 film prints. The archive represents a diversity of work from the Sundance Film Festival as well as projects developed through the Sundance Labs. From features to documentaries to shorts, prints in the Collection include ''[[Sex, Lies, and Videotape]]'', ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]'',&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; ''[[The Living End]]'', ''[[Smoke Signals (film)|Smoke Signals]]'', ''[[Amores Perros]]'', ''[[Harlan County, USA]]'', ''[[Love &amp; Basketball]]'', and ''[[Welcome to the Dollhouse]]'', among many other works that might otherwise no longer exist.

The Collection also provides a central resource for the study of independent film, containing a rare assemblage of material related to the history of independent cinema, including press kits and filmmaker interviews.

'''''The How and the Why''''' is a play by [[Sarah Treem]] who is a staff writer for HBO 's ''[[In Treatment (U.S. TV series)|In Treatment]]''. The play depicts two women biologists meeting for the first time, one near the end of her career and the other at the beginning. The older woman has earned fame for her work on the [[Grandmother hypothesis]]. The younger wants to present a radical new hypothesis to explain why human females [[menstruate]] while most mammals do not. The play deals with the workings of science and its impact on the personal lives of women scientists.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/14/nyregion/a-review-of-the-how-and-the-why-at-penguin-rep-theater.html New York Times review]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Sean-Bhean bhocht''', [[Gaeilge|Irish]] for the "Poor old woman" (often spelt phonetically in this song as "Shan Van Vocht"), is a traditional Irish song from the period of the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]], and dating in particular to the lead up to a [[Revolutionary France|French]] expedition to [[Bantry Bay]], that ultimately failed to get ashore in 1796.
 
The ''Sean-Bhean bhocht'' is used to personify Ireland, a poetic motif which heralds back to the [[aisling]] of native [[Irish Language]] poetry. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jean|first=Lauren|title=The Death of Cu Chulainn: Ancient Celtic Pagan Imagery and the 1916 Easter Rising |url=https://www.academia.edu/1549364/The_Death_of_Cu_Chulainn_Ancient_Celtic_Pagan_Imagery_and_the_1916_Easter_Rising|publisher=College of William and Mary|accessdate=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many different versions of the song have been composed by balladeers over the years, with the lyrics adapted to reflect the political climate at the time of composition. The title of the song, tune and narration of the misfortunes of the ''Shean Bhean bhocht'' remain a constant however, and this version, probably the best known, expresses confidence in the victory of the [[United Irishmen]] in the looming [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|rebellion]] upon the arrival of French aid. 

[[William Butler Yeats|W. B. Yeats]] and [[Augusta, Lady Gregory]] based their 1902 nationalist play, ''[[Cathleen Ní Houlihan]]'', on the legend dramatized in this song. A more recent version of the character is the speaker in Tommy Makem's "Four Green Fields," a song composed in the modern context of Northern Ireland's partition from the Republic of Ireland. The character also appears as the old lady selling milk in the opening passage of ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' by James Joyce.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14604">Traditional education, also known as '''back-to-basics''', '''conventional education''' or '''customary education''', refers to long-established customs that society traditionally used in schools.  Some forms of [[education reform]] promote the adoption of progressive education practices, a more holistic approach which focuses on individual students' needs and self-control. In the eyes of reformers, traditional teacher-centered methods focused on rote learning and memorization must be abandoned in favor of student-centered and task-based approaches to learning.  However, many parents and conservative citizens are concerned with the maintenance of objective educational standards based on testing, which favors a more traditional approach.

Depending on the context, the opposite of ''traditional education'' may be [[progressive education]], modern education (the education approaches based on [[developmental psychology]]), or [[alternative education]].&lt;ref name=3r /&gt;

==Definition==
The definition of ''traditional education'' varies greatly with geography and by historical period.

The chief business of traditional education is to transmit to a next generation those skills, facts, and standards of moral and social conduct that adults consider to be necessary for the next generation's material and social success.&lt;ref name=Dewey&gt;{{cite book
|isbn=978-0-912099-35-4
|title=Experience and education
|author=Dewey, John
|authorlink=John Dewey
|publisher=[[Kappa Delta Pi]]
|year=1938
|pages=1–5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As beneficiaries of this scheme, which educational progressivist [[John Dewey]] described as being "imposed from above and from outside", the students are expected to docilely and obediently receive and believe these fixed answers.  Teachers are the instruments by which this knowledge is communicated and these standards of behavior are enforced.&lt;ref name=Dewey /&gt;

Historically, the primary educational technique of traditional education was simple oral [[recitation]]:&lt;ref name=3r&gt;{{cite book |title= The Three R's Plus: What Today's Schools are Trying to Do and Why |author=Beck, Robert H. |isbn=978-0-8166-6017-9 |publisher=U of Minnesota Press |year=2009 |pages =3–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a typical approach, students sat quietly at their places and listened to one student after another recite his or her lesson, until each had been called upon.  The teacher's primary activity was assigning and listening to these recitations; students studied and memorized the assignments at home.  A test or [[oral examination]] might be given at the end of a unit, and the process, which was called "assignment-study-recitation-test", was repeated.  In addition to its overemphasis on verbal answers, reliance on [[rote memorization]] (memorization with no effort at understanding the meaning), and disconnected, unrelated assignments, it was also an extremely inefficient use of students' and teachers' time.  This traditional approach also insisted that all students be taught the same materials at the same point; students that did not learn quickly enough failed, rather than being allowed to succeed at their natural speeds.  This approach, which had been imported from Europe, dominated American education until the end of the 19th century, when [[Education reform#Progressive reforms in Europe and the United States|the education reform movement]] imported progressive education techniques from Europe.&lt;ref name=3r /&gt;

Traditional education is associated with much stronger elements of coercion than seems acceptable now in most cultures.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008 |reason= This is a rather vague and broad generalization}}  It has sometimes included: the use of [[corporal punishment]] to maintain classroom discipline or punish errors; inculcating the dominant religion and language; separating students according to gender, race, and [[social class]] {{citation needed|date=August 2014 |reason= This is an unsupported and quite provocative claim}} , as well as teaching different subjects to girls and boys. In terms of curriculum there was and still is a high level of attention paid to time-honoured academic knowledge.

In the present it varies enormously from culture to culture, but still tends to be characterised by a much higher level of coercion than [[alternative education]]. Traditional schooling in Britain and its possessions and former colonies tends to follow the English Public School style of strictly enforced uniforms and a militaristic style of discipline. This can be contrasted with South African, US and Australian schools, which can have a much higher tolerance for spontaneous student-to-teacher communication.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008 |reason= Again, overly broad generalizations}}

| Learning, retention, accumulation of valuable knowledge &amp; skills
|-
|Classroom
|Students matched by age, and possibly also by ability.  All students in a classroom are taught the same material.
|Students dynamically grouped by interest or ability for each project or subject, with the possibility of different groups each hour of the day.

|-
|Teaching methods
|Traditional education emphasizes:
* [[Direct instruction]] and lectures
* [[Seatwork]]
* Students learn through listening and observation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canteach.ca/elementary/fnations2.html |title=CanTeach - Traditional Education |publisher=Canteach.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|Progressive education emphasizes:
* Hands-on activities
* Student-led discovery
* Group activities
|-
| Materials || Instruction based on textbooks, lectures, and individual written assignments  || Project-based instruction using any available resource including Internet, library and outside experts
|-
| Subjects || Individual, independent subjects.
Little connection between topics&lt;ref name="montessori-namta1"/&gt;
|| Integrated, interdisciplinary subjects or theme-based units, such as reading a story about cooking a meal and calculating the cost of the food.
|-
| Content || Memorization of facts, objective information; Correct knowledge is paramount
|| Understanding the facts, Application of facts, Analysis, Evaluation, Innovation; Critical thinking is paramount
|-
|Social aspects || Little or no attention to social development.&lt;ref name="montessori-namta1"/&gt;
Focus on independent learning. Socializing largely discouraged except for extracurricular activities and teamwork-based projects.
|| Significant attention to social development, including teamwork, interpersonal relationships, and self-awareness.
|-
| Multiple tracks || 
* A single, unified curriculum for all students, regardless of ability or interest.
* Diverse class offerings without tracking, so that students receive a custom-tailored education.
* With [[School to work]], academically weak students must take some advanced classes, while the college bound may have to spend half-days job shadowing at local businesses.
||
Students choose (or are steered towards) different kinds of classes according to their perceived abilities or career plans.
Decisions made early in education may preclude changes later, as a student on a [[vo-tech]] track may not have completed necessary prerequisite classes to switch to a university-preparation program.
|-
| Equity || 
* Presentation and testing methods favor students who have prior exposure to the material or exposure in multiple contexts.
* Requirements to study or memorize outside school inadvertently tests homes not students.
* Students from homes where tested subjects are used in common conversation, or homes where students are routinely given individual help to gain context beyond memorization, score on tests at significantly higher levels. 
||
* Context learning integrates personal knowledge within the school environment.
* Individualized expectations simplifies individual supports and keeps focus student based.
* Community study settings include multiple cultures and expose all students to diversity.

|-
| Student and teacher relationship || Students often address teachers formally by their last names.  The teacher is considered a respected role model in the community.  Students should obey the teacher. Proper behavior for the university or professional work community is emphasized. || In [[alternative school]]s, students may be allowed to call teachers by their first names.  Students and teachers may work together as collaborators.

==Marking==

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Topic !! Traditional approach !! Alternate approaches
|-
| Communicating with parents || A few numbers, letters, or words are used to summarize overall achievement in each class.  Marks may be assigned according to objective [[Criterion-referenced test|individual performance]] (usually the number of correct answers) or [[Norm-referenced test|compared to other students]] (best students get the best grades, worst students get poor grades).
A passing grade may or may not signify mastery:  a failing student may know the material but not complete homework assignments, and a passing student may turn in all homework but still not understand the material.
|| Many possible forms of communicating achievements:
* Teachers may be required to write personalized narrative evaluations about student achievement and abilities.
* Under [[Outcome-based education|standards-based education]], a government agency may require all students to pass a test; students who fail to perform adequately on the test may not be promoted.
|-
| Expectations || Students will graduate with different grades. Some students will fail due to poor performance based on a lack of understanding or incomplete assignments. || All students need to achieve a basic level of education, even if this means spending extra years in school.
|-
| Grade inflation/deflation || Achievement based on performance compared to a reasonably stable, probably informal standard which is highly similar to what previous students experienced. || The value of any given mark is often hard to standardize in alternative grading schemes.  Comparison of students in different classes may be difficult or impossible.
|}

==Subject areas==

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Topic !! Traditional approach !! Alternate approaches
|-
| Mathematics || [[Traditional mathematics]]:
* Emphasis is on memorization of basic facts such as the [[multiplication table]] and mastering step-by-step arithmetic [[algorithms]] by studying examples and much practice.
* One correct answer is sought, using one "standard" method.
* Mathematics after elementary grades is tracked with different students covering different levels of material.
* Mathematics is taught as its own discipline without emphasis on social, political or global issues. There may be some emphasis on practical applications in science and technology.
||
* Curriculum de-emphasizes procedural knowledge drills in favor of technology (calculators, computers) and an emphasis on conceptual understanding.
* Lessons may include more exploratory material supportive of conceptual understanding, rather than direct presentation of facts and methods.
* Emphasis may be on practical applications and greater issues such as the environment, gender and racial diversity, and social justice.
* Mathematics lessons may include writing, drawing, games, and instruction with manipulatives rather than filling out worksheets.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., see [[Investigations in Numbers, Data, and Space|Investigations]] series&lt;/ref&gt;
* Lessons may include exploration of concepts allowing students to invent their own procedures before teaching standard algorithms.
* Grading may be based on demonstration of conceptual understanding rather than entirely on whether the final answer is correct.
* In some countries (e.g. the United States), there may be expectations of high achievement and mastering algebra for all students rather than tracking some students into business math and others into mathematics for math and science careers.
|-
| Science || Fact-based science:  Science class is an opportunity to transmit concrete knowledge and specific vocabulary from the teacher (or textbook) to the students.  Students focus on memorizing what they are told.  "Experiments" follow cookbook-style procedures to produce the expected results. || With [[Inquiry-based Science]] a student might be asked to devise an experiment to demonstrate that the earth orbits the sun.  The emphasis changes from memorizing information that was learned through a scientific method to actually using the scientific method of discovery.
|-
| Language learning || [[Phonics]]:  The focus is on explicit training in sound to letter correspondence rules and the mechanics of decoding individual words.  Students initially focus on phonics subskills and reading simplified [[decodable text]]s. When they have mastered a sufficient number of rules, they are allowed to read freely and extensively. (In many languages, such as French, Spanish and Greek, phonics is taught in the context of reading simple open syllables.) || With [[whole language]] the child is exposed to rich, relevant language that can heighten motivation to read. Learning to read is assumed to be as natural as learning to speak, so students are not formally taught sound to letter correspondences, but assumed to infer them on their own. (Note that this issue is limited to languages such as English and French with complex phonetics and spelling rules. Instruction in countries with languages such as Spanish and Greek, which have relatively simple phonetic spelling, still depends mainly on phonics.)

The '''Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage''' is a treaty that was adopted on 2 November 2001 by the General Conference of the [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO).&lt;ref name=Official_Text&gt;UNESCO [http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/underwater-cultural-heritage/2001-convention/official-text/ "2001 Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage"] 2 November 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The convention is intended to protect "all traces of human existence having a cultural, historical or archaeological character" which have been under water for over 100 years.&lt;ref name=Official_Text/&gt;{{rp|Art.1}} This extends to the protection of shipwrecks, sunken cities, prehistoric art work, treasures that may be looted, sacrificial and burial sites, and old ports that cover the oceans' floors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/underwater-cultural-heritage/the-underwater-heritage/&lt;/ref&gt; The preservation of underwater cultural heritage is significant as it allows for the retelling of numerous historical events. As part of its duty to conduct scientific research and provide continuous education on the importance of underwater cultural heritage, UNESCO strives to maintain these sites for the enjoyment of current and future generations. The convention may provide a customary framework to help raise awareness and seek to combat the illegal looting and pirating occurring in waters worldwide. As an international body, member states of the convention agree to work towards the preservation of sunken cultural property within their jurisdiction and the high seas.

==Cultural heritage==
As an international body, UNESCO continues to work towards the preservation of cultural goods worldwide. Similar to cultural property, only physical goods that are bestowed to future generations may fall into the protection of cultural heritage. It is thus a form of inheritance that allows current and future generations to learn about significant historical events.&lt;ref name = Frigo&gt;Frigo, Manlio. "Cultural property v. cultural heritage: A 'battle of concepts' in international law?." ''International Review of the Red Cross'' 86.854 (2004): 367–78 at 369.&lt;/ref&gt; Particular to the concept of heritage, international agreements exist under the Council of Europe  such as the 1885 Convention on the Protection of Archaeological Heritage of Europe and the European Convention on the Protection of Archaeological Heritage. These bodies create broad legal protections around cultural heritage antiquities and sites that are specific to communities worldwide.&lt;ref name = Frigo/&gt; The 1954 Hague Convention was truly the first international convention that attempted to discuss the protection of cultural heritage. In defining property that is considered 'important' and 'valuable' for the good of the people, the issue of protecting cultural property became noticeable to international parties.&lt;ref name = Forrest&gt;Forrest, C. J. S. (2002). "Defining 'underwater cultural heritage'". ''The International Journal of Nautical Archaeology'', 31(1), 3–11. doi:10.1006/ijna.2002.1022 p.3&lt;/ref&gt; It was only in the 1972 UNESCO Convention concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage, that the term 'cultural heritage' was employed to define the cultural objects to be protected at an international level &lt;ref&gt;Forrest, C. J. S. (2002). "Defining 'underwater cultural heritage'". ''The International Journal of Nautical Archaeology'', 31(1), 3–11. doi:10.1006/ijna.2002.1022 p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to its expansive definition, the concept of cultural heritage was further revised in the 1992 European Convention on the Protection of Archaeological Heritage. They serve to assert the universal value of protecting cultural objects that make up the history and identity of nations.

Along with the 100-year limitation period, the 2001 UNESCO Convention included the phrase 'cultural, historical or archaeological character' as the qualifying concepts that define underwater cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Forrest, C. J. S. (2002). "Defining 'underwater cultural heritage'". ''The International Journal of Nautical Archaeology'', 31(1), 3–11. doi:10.1006/ijna.2002.1022 p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Because many objects of cultural heritage lose their significance when taken out of water, this convention seeks to ensure the preservation of sunken sites.

==Content==
;Official text:
The official text of the convention sets out the obligations of the states parties in regards to the protection of underwater cultural heritage, defined in Article 1 as:

"all traces of human existence having a cultural, historical or archaeological character which have been partially or totally under water, periodically or continuously, for at least 100 years"&lt;ref name=Official_Text/&gt;

Articles 1–4 define the convention and its objectives, as well as its relation to the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] (UNCLOS) and the [[law of salvage]].&lt;ref name=Official_Text/&gt;

Articles 5–12 define varying levels of obligations and procedures within the four [[maritime boundary|maritime zones]] ([[Territorial Waters|Territorial Sea]], Contiguous Zone, [[Exclusive Economic Zone]], [[International Waters]]) defined by [[UNCLOS]].&lt;ref name=Official_Text/&gt;

Articles 13–21 define further obligations, such as seizing illicitly recovered underwater cultural heritage, cooperating with other states parties, and providing training in [[underwater archaeology]].&lt;ref name=Official_Text/&gt;

Articles 22–35 clarify a number of points relevant to the functional aspects of the convention, such as the creation of statutory bodies, the settlement of disputes between states parties, and modes of ratification.&lt;ref name=Official_Text/&gt;

;Annex:
In addition to the official text of the convention, an annex of 36 rules governs the practical aspects of activities directed at underwater cultural heritage. States parties are required to ensure that these rules are applied within their territorial sea and contiguous zone,&lt;ref name=Official_Text/&gt;{{rp|Art.7–8}} and also that they are adhered to by all nationals and flag vessels.&lt;ref name=Official_Text/&gt;{{rp|Art.16}}

Rules 1–8 define general principles. Key among these are the complete prohibition of the commercial exploitation of underwater cultural heritage&lt;ref name=Official_Text/&gt;{{rp|Rule 2}} and the principle that ''[[in situ]]'' preservation should always be considered as a first option.&lt;ref name=Official_Text/&gt;{{rp|Rule 1}} The rules also cover aspects such as project design, conservation, documentation, and reporting.&lt;ref name=Official_Text/&gt;

==International law==
Situated between admiralty/private maritime law, the law of the sea, and cultural heritage law, the legal framework of underwater cultural heritage law is robust. [[Admiralty law]] is a branch entrenched within private international law relating to the control of maritime practices between private entities.&lt;ref name="Dromgoole, S. 2013 p.8"&gt;Dromgoole, S. (2013). ''Underwater cultural heritage and international law''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Activities that fall under the protection of admiralty law include marine operations, marine salvaging, shipping and receiving. Subject to the common law jurisdiction and handled within domestic court systems, the body of admiralty law seeks to protect the rights and interests of private parties, with respect to practices at sea.&lt;ref name="Dromgoole, S. 2013 p.8"/&gt; On a broader level, this law seeks to fulfill public policy objectives including the safety of life and property, while ensuring the protection of the global marine environments.&lt;ref name="Dromgoole, S. 2013 p.9"&gt;Dromgoole, S. (2013). ''Underwater cultural heritage and international law''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

The public international law body of the [[law of the sea]] was established to manage inter-state relations regarding practices in international waters. This complex body of law has grown to develop its own principles, particular methods of enforcement and Tribunals. Its primary objective is to create a supportive legal framework to determine the rights and duties of states with respect to their use of the ocean.&lt;ref name="Dromgoole, S. 2013 p.9"/&gt;

In 1982, the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]]  (UNCLOS) was developed to govern the deep-sea beds vis-à-vis increasing commercial exploitation of sunken objects.&lt;ref name="Dromgoole, S. 2013 p.10"&gt;Dromgoole, S. (2013). ''Underwater cultural heritage and international law''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; In light of the emergence of newly independent states, a need was created for an international legal body that would help protect underwater cultural goods, in waters used by many parties worldwide. Resulting from the third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS III) between 1973 and 1982, the Convention has created many new regulations applicable to nation states. Once signed, the Convention had established two maritime zones with governing international regulations, affixed the maximum depth-level at sea at twelve miles, created specific regimes for international and archipelagic states, and introduced three new international institutions.&lt;ref name="Dromgoole, S. 2013 p.10"/&gt;

The 2001 UN Convention on the Protection of Underwater Cultural Heritage is a product of international agreement on the adequate conduct of member states at sea.&lt;ref name=Official_Text /&gt; Its legal framework stems from two distinct sections of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (LOSC), including article 149 and 303.

Article 149 of the LOSC provides that:
" All objects of an archaeological and historical nature found in the
Area shall be preserved or disposed of for the benefit of mankind
as a whole, particular regard being paid to the preferential rights
of the State or country of origin, or the State of cultural origin, or
the State of historical and archaeological origin." &lt;ref name="law.berkeley.edu"&gt;http://www.law.berkeley.edu/files/Bautista-final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 303 of the LOSC states that:
"1. States have the duty to protect objects of an archaeological and
historical nature found at sea and shall cooperate for this purpose.

2. In order to control traffic on such objects, the coastal State
may, in applying article 33, presume that their removal from the
seabed in the zone referred to in that article without its approval
would result in an infringement within its territory or territorial
sea of the laws and regulations referred to in that article.

3. Nothing in this article affects the rights of identifiable owners,
the law of salvage or other rules of admiralty, or laws or practices
with respect to cultural heritage.

4. This article is without prejudice to other international
agreements and rules of international law regarding the protection
of objects of an archaeological and historical nature." &lt;ref name="law.berkeley.edu"/&gt;

To ensure that member states abide by the regulations stipulated within the Convention, they are to further adopt the following;

1 Each Party is to adopt domestic legislation that prohibits nationals and vessels from engaging in activities that would purposely interfere with the protection of underwater cultural heritage

2 Each Party is to require that all nationals and vessels report any new discoveries to UNESCO and fellow member states that are considered to be a part of underwater cultural heritage located in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), the Continental shelf and Area

3 Each Party is to take appropriate measures to prevent the dealing of objects considered to be underwater cultural heritage. This includes the illicit sale or exportation, as well as trade or seizing of the object found in their territory.

A recorded 22 earthquakes between 320 and 1303 AD on the coast of Pharos in Egypt shook the city of Alexandria, which was home to [[Pharos Lighthouse]].&lt;ref name="touregypt.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/pharoslighthouse.htm|title=Pharos Lighthouse of Alexandria|publisher=|accessdate=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effects of these earthquakes, and several more in the centuries that followed suggest that the large monument may have fallen into the sea, leaving massive blocks of stone awaiting the exploration mission led by archaeologist Jean-Yves Empereur in 1994. While many components of the old lighthouse are on display at the Kom el-Dikka museum in Alexandria, archaeologists suggest that around 500 pieces remain on the sea floor.&lt;ref name="touregypt.net"/&gt; Today, the Alexandria Lighthouse is among one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. 
 
On July 19, 1545, the British Fleet known as the ''[[Mary Rose]]'' sunk to the bottom of the [[Portsmouth Harbour]], in the United Kingdom. While its failures still remain a mystery, is estimated that at least 500 men were trapped in the ship, and only 35 of these escaped to safety &lt;ref&gt;Attenborough, G. (2013). The Mary Rose Museum (Portsmouth). ''The Journal of Transport History'', 34(2), 198.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, sixty million people watched as the vessel was lifted out of its resting place, with its 19,000 discovered objects still intact. Due to the preservation of this monument of underwater cultural heritage in the ''Mary Rose'' museum, the public can continue to enjoy the vessel and all of her artifacts.

Off the coast of Sweden in 1628, the pride of the Swedish Navy, the ''[[Vasa (ship)|Vasa]]'' sunk deep beneath the frigid waters of the Baltic Sea.&lt;ref name="Adams, A. 1995"&gt;Adams, A. (1995, ). Sweden's vasa museum, an overwhelming sight: Final edition. The Record&lt;/ref&gt; Under the orders of King Gustavus II Adolphus, the immense vessel was built to support Swedish military campaigns during the Thirty Years' War, yet was toppled by swift winds at sea.&lt;ref name="Adams, A. 1995"/&gt; The Vasa remained peacefully underwater until a team of archaeologists raised the wreck in 1961.&lt;ref name="Adams, A. 1995"/&gt; Fortunately, the wreck and all of its belongings were salvaged, despite its lengthily time spent on the ocean floor. Today, the Swedish ''Vasa'' museum in Stockholm is an emblem of cultural heritage, dedicated to educating public citizens worldwide.

In 1985, two scientists discovered the [[RMS Titanic|''RMS'' Titanic]] in the northern waters of the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada &lt;ref&gt;Dromgoole, S. (2013). Underwater cultural heritage and international law. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.p.4.&lt;/ref&gt;  Within the wreck, 1,800 artifacts were found, deeming the discovery a very important contribution to the field of Underwater Cultural Heritage &lt;ref&gt;Dromgoole, S. (2013). Underwater cultural heritage and international law. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p.4&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Titanic'' has raised significant questions surrounding the remaining passengers, the value of the wreck and the items lost therein, as well as the impact of the accident &lt;ref&gt;Dromgoole, S. (2013). Underwater cultural heritage and international law. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.p.5&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of the ship, and other sunken wrecks, may have also raised questions about the legal framework of the UN Convention on the Protection of Underwater Cultural Heritage.

==Pirating and looting==

As early as the sixth century BC, as Rome gained control over the Greek colonies of Italy and aligned itself with the western states, it developed a fleet that would allow the state to become the most powerful naval entity. Due to the lawless waters along the eastern coasts of Italy, this area was prevalent in pirating. Modern scholars refer to this area as being "inhabited by wild, uncivilized tribes, who were active marauders of the land and sea, and were constantly reinforced from the interior".&lt;ref&gt;Heller-Roazen, Daniel. The Enemy of All: Piracy and the Law of Nations. New York: Zone Books, 2009. p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; While many dispute the accounts of these events, the marauding nature of pirates may continue to remain true today. Although naval warfare has decreased in popularity, modern pirates are now turning to alternatives to attain their desired treasures.

Today, it is estimated that three million undiscovered shipwrecks and ruins continue to lie at the bottom of the oceans. With the introduction and growing popularity of scuba-diving since the 1940s, the accessibility of such underwater cultural heritage sites are becoming easier to modern pirates in search of new treasure. Studies have already shown that as of 1974, all known shipwrecks off the coasts of Turkey have been exploited by underwater pirates.&lt;ref name="unesco.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/underwater/infokit_en/|title=Publication Name:|publisher=|accessdate=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Israeli archaeologists estimate that at least 60 per cent of cultural objects that once lay in wrecks and sites have now disappeared without any trace.&lt;ref name="unesco.org"/&gt; Due to the sheer mass of the world's oceans and the inability to monitor all activity that takes place therein, pirates and underwater thieves continue to pose a significant threat to the preservation of cultural heritage and cultural property.

In 2006, the UNESCO convention was ratified by an additional state, [[Portugal]], needing international protection for the looting of its underwater cultural heritage sites. At least six international treasure hunting organizations had established themselves off the coasts of Portugal to reap the benefits of the nation's coastline after new legislation had allowed for the sale of artifacts collected underwater during archaeological excavations in 1993. Due to this, physical goods may have been looted without proper care, damaging the cultural property that was left behind. Not only did Portugal face a loss of cultural goods, but also possible facts about its historical events.  
&lt;ref name="unesco.org"/&gt; Today, Portugal is among one of the nations that is protected by the body of the UN Convention, wherein the commercial exploitation and dispersion are legally banned, and underwater archeological sites and wrecks are preserved for the future.

==Criticisms==
Abstaining from signing the 2001 UN Convention, the United States has stipulated that the term "all traces of human existence" is too broad, legally and as a mechanism tool for the protection of underwater cultural heritage for the preservation of future generations.&lt;ref&gt;Forrest, C. J. S. (2002). "Defining 'underwater cultural heritage'". The International Journal of Nautical Archaeology, 31(1), 3–11. doi:10.1006/ijna.2002.1022 p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; A problem that may arise with the 100-year period is that the beginning of this period is not clearly identified in the Convention, nor in the LOSC &lt;ref&gt;Forrest, C. J. S. (2002). "Defining 'underwater cultural heritage'". The International Journal of Nautical Archaeology, 31(1), 3–11. doi:10.1006/ijna.2002.1022 p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

A criticism of the LOSC Articles is that they are considered ambiguous and obscure in nature. Article 149 fails to specify the manner in which objects of an archaeological nature are to be preserved of and disposed, as well as which mechanisms should be instituted in their conservation so as to benefit all current and future generations &lt;ref name="law.berkeley.edu"/&gt;

With the discovery of the [[Spanish galleon San José]] by the Colombian Government, and in an effort to claim the galleon with all its cargo, the Spanish Government tried to use the convention as a measure to stop Colombia from salvaging the ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.las2orillas.co/quienes-reclamaran-el-tesoro-del-galeon-san-jose/|title=¿Quiénes reclamarán el tesoro del galeón San José?|work=Las2orillas|accessdate=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 13 recognises sovereign immunity over sunken warships, &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/underwater-cultural-heritage/2001-convention/official-text/|title=Official texts – United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|publisher=|accessdate=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Colombia is not a participating member of the convention. Separately, Colombia has called the galleon part of its submerged patrimony so it is constitutionally bound to protect and preserve the warship.

'''Vernacular literature''' is [[literature]] written in the [[vernacular]]—the speech of the "common people".

In the [[Europe]]an tradition, this effectively means literature not written in [[Latin]]. In this context, vernacular literature appeared during the Middle Ages at different periods in the various countries; the earliest European vernacular literatures are [[Irish literature]], [[Literature of Wales (Welsh language)|Welsh literature]], [[Anglo-Saxon literature]] and [[Gothic language|Gothic literature]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}.

The [[Italy|Italian]] poet [[Dante Alighieri]], in his ''[[De vulgari eloquentia]]'', was possibly the first European writer to argue cogently for the promotion of literature in the vernacular.&lt;ref&gt;http://alighieri.letteraturaoperaomnia.org/translate_english/alighieri_dante_de_vulgari_eloquentia.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/dante.html&lt;/ref&gt; Important early vernacular works include Dante's ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]'s ''[[Decameron]]'' (both in [[Italian language|Italian]]), [[John Barbour (poet)|John Barbour]]'s ''[[The Brus]]'' (in [[Scots language|Scots]]), [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'' (in [[English language|Middle English]]) and [[Jacob van Maerlant]]'s ''Spieghel Historiael'' (in [[Middle Dutch]]). Indeed, Dante's work actually contributed towards the creation of the Italian language.

The term is also applied to works not written in the standard and/or prestige language of their time and place.  For example, many authors in Scotland, such as [[James Kelman]] and [[Edwin Morgan (poet)|Edwin Morgan]] have used [[Scots language|Scots]], even though English is now the prestige language of publishing in [[Scotland]].  [[Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o]] writes in his native [[Gikuyu language]] though he previously wrote in [[English language|English]]. Some authors have written in invented vernacular; examples of such novels include the futuristic literary novels ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' by [[Anthony Burgess]] and ''[[Boxy an Star]]'' by [[Daren King]].

==Outside Europe==
By extension, the term is also used to describe, for example, [[Chinese literature]] not written in classical Chinese and [[India]]n literature after [[Sanskrit]].  In the [[India]]n culture, traditionally religious or scholarly works were written in [[Prakrit]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Sanskrit]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.southasia.sas.upenn.edu/tamil/lit.html&lt;/ref&gt; With the rise of the [[Bhakti movement]] from the 8th century on-wards, religious works began to be created in [[Kannada language|Kannada]], and [[Telugu language|Telugu]], and from the 12th Century onward in many other Indian languages throughout the different regions of India. For example, the [[Ramayana]], one of Hinduism's sacred epics in Sanskrit, had vernacular versions such as  ''[[Ramacharitamanasa]]'', a [[Hindi]] version of the Ramayana by the 16th century poet [[Tulsidas]]. In China, the [[New Culture Movement]] of the 1910s–20s promoted vernacular literature.

In the [[Philippines]], the term means any written literature in a language other than [[Filipino language|Filipino]] (or [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]) or [[Philippine English|English]]. At present, it forms the second largest corpus of literature, following the literature in Tagalog. During the Spanish colonial era, when Filipino was not yet existing as a national lingua franca, literature in this type flourished. Aside from religious literature, such as the '''[[Pasyon|Passiong Mahal]]''' (the Passion of Our Lord), [[zarzuela]]s were also produced using the [[Philippine languages|Philippine vernacular languages]].{{fact|date=May 2016}}

In terms of [[Arabic language|Arabic]], vernacular literature refers to literature written in any of the [[Arabic dialects|dialects of Arabic]] as opposed to [[Classical Arabic]] or [[Modern Standard Arabic]]. Examples of literary figures who have written in [[Egyptian Arabic|the Egyptian dialect]] are [[Ahmed Fouad Negm]], [[Muhammad Husayn Haykal]] and [[Salah Jahin]], as well as a wave of modern writers.{{fact|date=May 2016}}
Leonardo Da vinci Used vernacular in his work .

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11510">'''The West Africa Network for Peacebuilding''' The West Africa Network for Peacebuilding (WANEP) is a leading Regional Peacebuilding organisation founded in 1998 in response to civil wars that plagued West Africa in the 1990s. Over the years, WANEP has succeeded in establishing strong national networks in every Member State of ECOWAS with over 550 member organisations across West Africa. WANEP places special focus on collaborative approaches to conflict prevention, and peacebuilding, working with diverse actors from civil society, governments, intergovernmental bodies, women groups and other partners in a bid to establish a platform for dialogue, experience sharing and learning, thereby complementing efforts at ensuring sustainable peace and development in West Africa and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wanep.org West Africa Network for Peacebuilding(WANEP)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding==
WANEP was founded by two distinguished Africans; Samuel Gbaydee Doe and Emmanuel Habuka Bombande. Sam Gbadyee Doe is a peacebuilding and development professional from Liberia. He began his academic career from the University of Liberia where he studied Economics with the intention of being a banker and later proceeded to the Eastern Mennonite University for his MA in conflict transformation and Bradford University in the U.K. for a PhD. It was at EMU that the dream for the establishment of WANEP began when his paths crossed with John Paul Lederach and Emmanuel Bombande.

Mr. Emmanuel Habuka Bombande is a Ghanaian National Peacebuilding Practitioner with proven expertise in conflict transformation, peacebuilding, and development. After his social science degree from the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology-Kumasi Ghana, Mr. Bombande proceeded to the Eastern Mennonite University, USA for a master's degree in Conflict Transformation. It was there he met Sam Doe leading to the birth of WANEP.

The story of WANEP cannot be completely told without mentioning the invaluable contributions of Professor John Paul Lederach especially during the formation and nurturing stages of the institution which he described as …”Beginning of a new era of peace, healing, reconciliation and hope in West Africa.” He was instrumental to bringing together and mentoring the two co-founders of WANEP.

Based on Sam Doe's background in working with trauma during the [[Second Liberian Civil War]], and in establishing youth dialogue organizations and Bombande’s efforts with [[Hizkias Assefa]] at the Nairobi Peace Initiative&lt;ref name=NPI&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.npi-africa.org/aboutus}}&lt;/ref&gt; in resolving the Kokomba-Nanumba conflict in northern Ghana, WANEP focused on both lessening existing conflicts and preventing future outbreaks. By directing efforts toward grassroots efforts the organization helped local leaders and citizens resolve conflicts without outside intervention.

==Leadership==
[[Samuel Gbaydee Doe]] served as the executive director of WANEP from its formation in 1998 until 2004. In 2004, then director of programs, [[Emmanuel Bombande]] was appointed executive director. In 2015,Dr. Chukwuemeka Eze, formerly the Program Director
took over from Bombande as the Executive Director while Levinia Addae-Mensah is the Deputy Executive Director/Program Director.

==Programs and Organizations==
WANEP has a niche in training CSOs, government and other practitioners in peacebuilding and conflict prevention.  This niche has worked well in supporting peace and averting conflict in many situations.  WANEP implements programs to equip the youth, business owners, women, traditional leaders and state agencies with requisite skills in conflict prevention and supports them to find local solutions or interventions to their unique conflict situations.WANEP emphasizes ownership and bottom-up approach to peacebuilding practice which enables the National Networks to carry out interventions that reflect the peculiarities of human security issues in their various countries. The national networks represent the WANEP brand and work in member states while the Regional Secretariat engages at the strategic level with ECOWAS, AU, UN and other intergovernmental, governmental and non-governmental organizations.

====Strategic Focus===
WANEP's key area of focus includes but not limited to the following;
 	Early Warning and Response (WARN)
 	Nonviolence and Peace Education (NAPE) 
 	Capacity-Building &amp; Development
 	Engendering Women in Peacebuilding Programs (WIPNET) 
 	Dialogue and Mediation
 	Civil Society Coordination and Democratic Governance
 	Gender
 	Research and Publication

==Key Impact/Achievements==
Under the WIPNET program, WANEP facilitated the Liberian Women Mass action for Peace initiated by Liberian Women in 2003. The women peace activism’s intervention in Liberia under the WIPNET program, led to the eventual ceasefire in the Liberian war. The outcome of the Liberian peace process and the role of WIPNET have been acknowledged all over the world and led to the Nobel Peace Prize awarded to Her Excellency Ellen Johnson and Lemay Gbowe (WANEP Liberia former Coordinator for the WIPNET program). The mass action for peace is credited with urging [[Charles Taylor (Liberian politician)|Charles Taylor]]’s government and the Liberians for Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD) into a ceasefire and leading to the end of the conflict. WANEP also facilitated the creation of ‘Peace Hut’ in Liberia to facilitate the reconciliation process and provide environment for victims to meet and reconcile with offenders. This concept was replicated in Cote d'Ivoire.

President [[Ellen Johnson Sirleaf]] has cited WIPNET as being one of the key factors supporting women’s prominent role in peace building in Liberia.&lt;ref name=reliefweb&gt;{{cite web|title=President Sirleaf Discusses Liberian Women’s Involvement in Peacemaking and Peacebuilding |url=http://reliefweb.int/report/liberia/president-sirleaf-discusses-liberian-women%E2%80%99s-involvement-peacemaking-and |date=27 September 2012|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2015, WANEP signed an MOU with the African Union Commission to provide support to the Commission’s Peace and Security Department in the implementation of the AU Peace and Security Architecture (APSA) including the gender mainstreaming of the architecture.

The work of WANEP in establishing an early warning system has been instrumental in helping to resolve multiple conflicts in early stages.  In 2014 this effort was officially recognized by [[Cote d’Ivoire]]’s permanent representative to the [[United Nations]] [[Youssoufou Bamba]] in his official remarks at the Informal interactive Dialogue on the Responsibility to Protect: "Fulfilling our collective responsibility: International assistance and the responsibility to protect,", September 8, 2014.

WANEP experience in peacebuilding has been sought for replication in East and Central Africa. The unique structure of WANEP contributed to WANEP’s choice as the Civil Society implementing partner for the operationalization of ECOWAS Early Warning Mechanism (ECOWARN).

&lt;blockquote&gt;A cet égard, permettez-moi de relever le travail remarquable que fait la section ivoirienne de la West Africa Network for Peacebuilding, la WANEP-CI, qui a mis en place une système indépendant d'alerte précoce, notamment par la diffusion de rapports mensuels de la collection d'informations, relatives à la sécurité humaine, et qui vise bien entendu, à soutenir les actions de prévention des conflits, et de promotion de la paix en Côte d'ivoire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Youssoufou | last = Bamba | title = Declaration Son Excellence Monsieur Youssoufou Bamba Ambassadeur Representant Permanent de la Republique de Cote d'Ivoire Aupres des Nations Unies |contribution= Statement by Cote d'Ivoire | contribution-url = http://www.globalr2p.org/media/files/cote-divoire-french.pdf | series = UN General Assembly Informal Interactive Dialogue on the Responsibility to Protect: "Fulfilling our collective responsibility: International assistance and the responsibility to protect," 2014 | year = 2014 | pages = 3 | place = New York | publisher = United Nations | url = http://www.globalr2p.org/resources/643}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In September 2013 WANEP was also recognized for their work with ECOWAS to promote peace education in selected secondary schools across the region. &lt;blockquote&gt;[These studies] will impart new ways of thinking and new way of viewing conflict thereby leading to building new structures and cultural practices in the society that deepens peaceful coexistence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Peace education must be well-pursued-WANEP |url=http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/artikel.php?ID=286528 |accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

ECOWAS/WANEP relationship was the first example of civil society and intergovernmental partnership not only in West Africa but Africa generally. The partnership has been highlighted as the best practice of building alliances with CSOs in conflict prevention and is a referral point 
&lt;www.wanep.org/resource page&gt;

==Affiliations==
The organization works with several regional partners including the [[Economic Community of West African States]], the African Union’s Economic, Social, and Cultural Council [[ECOSOCC]], and the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]](ECOSOC). WANEP is also a member of the Peace and Security cluster of ECOSOCC representing West Africa, and is the West Africa Regional Representative of the [[Global Partnership for the Prevention of Armed Conflict]] (GPPAC)and the Focal Point for Africa CSOs on the AU-EU Joint Strategy (JAES).&lt;ref name=wanep&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.wanep.org/wanep/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=7&amp;Itemid=11|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategic Partnerships==

In 2002, WANEP entered into a historic partnership with the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in the implementation of a regional early warning and response system referred to as ECOWARN. In 2004, WANEP and ECOWAS signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) which has consistently been renewed. this inter-governmental structure acts as a regional early warning and response system. WANEP and ECOWAS partnership enables typically non-governmental organizations a path to Track 1 diplomacy efforts early on in conflicts.

Inspired by its desire to contribute and commit to the sustenance of peace during elections, WANEP in collaboration with United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is implementing a five-year project (2015 to 2019) tagged, “Mitigating Election Violence in West Africa through National Early Warning Systems (NEWS)” in target countries of West Africa namely, Burkina Faso, Cote d’Ivoire, Niger, Ghana and Sierra Leone. Through this project, WANEP set up and operationalized an Election Situation Room (ESR) during elections in those countries. WANEP also partnered with other key stakeholders to run ESR in countries such as Benin, The Gambia and Nigeria.

WANEP is working in partnership with the Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping Training Centre (KAIPTC) in Accra, Ghana to run the West Africa Peacebuilding Institute (WAPI)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1373">'''Western Saharan literature in Spanish''' is a small body of writing which has emerged in contemporary times mainly in the form of lyrics written by singers who have chosen the [[Spanish language]] as their medium.

==Linguistic and historical context==

This choice of the [[Spanish language]] as Western Saharan songwriters' medium of expression reflects the fact that, together with [[Equatorial Guinea]], where a more sizeable [[Spanish language]] literature has emerged, [[Western Sahara]] was formerly a colony of [[Spain]], and the principal language of that country has remained as a widespread ''lingua franca''.
