'''Acapulco Gold''' is a strain of ''[[Cannabis sativa]]'' that was popular during the 1960s counterculture movement for its potency and unique colour.

==History==
First recorded in the United States in 1964,&lt;ref name=novak&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychedelic-library.org/high_culture11.htm|title=High Culture: Marijuana in the Lives of Americans|last=Novak|first=William|date=1979|publisher=Knopf|accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acapulco Gold was defined by the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' the following year as "a special grade of cannabis growing in the vicinity of [[Acapulco]]...with a color of brownish gold, or a mixture of gold and green."&lt;ref name=greenrush&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.greenrush.com/acapulco-gold-in-them-hills/|title=Mexico's Cannabis Treasure: Acapulco Gold|date=October 20, 2015|publisher=GreenRush Times|accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally cultivated in the Guerrero Mountains outside the city,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salem-news.com/articles/august282011/acapulco-tourism.php|title=Special Report: Acapulco 1967-2011|date=August 28, 2011|publisher=''Salem News''|accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is a landrace strain&lt;ref name=greenrush/&gt; described as having "mind-blowing effects", which were attributed to a long growing season and the plant growing in conditions to which it was adapted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tucsonweekly.com/tucson/marijuana-world/Content?oid=1082395|title=Marijuana World|last=Downing|first=Renee|date=November 17, 2005|publisher=''Tucson Weekly''|accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smuggler and promoter [[Gary Tovar]] said that Acapulco Gold's distinctive color was the outcome of the way the plants were aged and dried by the wind off the Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/apr/11/coachella-goldenvoice-gary-tovar-counterculture-marijuana-legalisation-hippies|title=Coachella's Goldenvoice founder Gary Tovar on how the counterculture won|last=Helmore|first=Edward|date=April 11, 2014|publisher=''The Guardian''|accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; When cultivated outside its native range, it is considered to be substantially less potent than native plants: "while the original genetics of Acapulco Gold can be found among global seed companies, without that blazing Acapulco sun and Gulf breezes, the end product remains an artifice, a simulacrum of what could be had in 1974."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.occnewspaper.com/why-few-call-it-cannabis/|title=Why Few Call It Cannabis|last=Saunders|first=Keith|date=October 3, 2016|publisher=Oregon Cannabis Connection|accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1975, ''[[New York Magazine]]'' claimed that the strain's original potency had already been diluted due to overplanting in response to demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LugCAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;ots=Q703F1pmxV&amp;dq=%22acapulco%20gold%22%20aphrodisiac&amp;pg=PA28#v=onepage&amp;q=%22acapulco%20gold%22%20aphrodisiac&amp;f=false|title=Entering the New Age of Pot|last=Goldman|first=Albert|date=August 25, 1975|publisher=''New York Magazine''|page=39|accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Called "connoisseur pot",&lt;ref name=stewart/&gt; in the 1960s Acapulco Gold was "a sought-after marijuana for American smokers, considered better quality than the weed growing in California or Texas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1G4FlXMOgfkC&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;dq=%22acapulco%20gold%22&amp;pg=PA42#v=onepage&amp;q=%22acapulco%20gold%22&amp;f=false|title=El Narco: Inside Mexico's Criminal Insurgency|last=Grillo|first=Ioan|date=November 1, 2011|publisher=Bloomsbury|page=42|accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Those in the know sought Mexican Acapulco Gold for the highest of highs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BDJH7SeLE8IC&amp;lpg=PA157&amp;ots=mJ2ppYellb&amp;dq=%22acapulco%20gold%22%20intellectual&amp;pg=PA157#v=onepage&amp;q=%22acapulco%20gold%22%20intellectual&amp;f=false|title=Droppers: America's First Hippie Commune, Drop City|last=Matthews|first=Mark|date=November 12, 2012|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|page=42|accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another report highlighted its "exquisite taste".&lt;ref name=novak/&gt; Its potency was due to a [[Tetrahydrocannabinol|THC]] content of 23%, making it one of the strongest strains available at the time.&lt;ref name=greenrush/&gt; The strain's association with quality was such that the 1993 textbook ''Drugs, Alcohol and Mental Health'' claimed that "Acapulco gold" had become a generic term for high-grade marijuana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z25uAoo9y04C&amp;lpg=PA33&amp;dq=%22acapulco%20gold%22&amp;pg=PA33#v=onepage&amp;q=%22acapulco%20gold%22&amp;f=false|title=Drugs, Alcohol and Mental Health|last=Cornwell|first=Alan|date=January 7, 1993|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=33|accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was incorrectly claimed as early as 1968 that the name 'Acapulco Gold' had been trademarked in anticipation of marijuana legalization;&lt;ref name=partridge/&gt; in August 1969, [[Harlan Ellison]] asserted that the trademark had been registered to tobacco company [[Liggett Group|Liggett &amp; Myers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PM0qAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT90&amp;ots=QWBF6Sp1AU&amp;dq=%22acapulco%20gold%22%20reagan&amp;pg=PT90#v=onepage&amp;q=%22acapulco%20gold%22%20reagan&amp;f=false|title=The Glass Teat|last=Ellison|first=Harlan|date=April 1, 2014|publisher=Open Road Media|accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, the term was used as a brand name for rolling papers intended to be sold to raise funds to campaign for marijuana legalization; Amorphia, the organization that backed the effort, eventually merged with [[National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws|NORML]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/joshua-clark-davis/the-long-marijuana-rights_b_6113894.html|title=The Long Marijuana-Rights Movement|last=Davis|first=Joshua Clark|date=January 6, 2015|publisher=''Huffington Post''|accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rolling papers reportedly generated most of the funding to support the 1972 California marijuana initiative [[California Proposition 19 (1972)|Proposition 19]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/10/10/archives/drive-to-legalize-marijuana-is-funded-by-nonprofit-company-in.html?_r=1|title=Drive to Legalize Marijuana Is Funded by Nonprofit Company in California|last=Bolles|first=Everett|date=October 10, 1972|publisher=''The New York Times''|accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the US Patent and Trademark Office briefly opened trade name registration for medical marijuana strains in 2010, Acapulco Gold was one of the trademarks submitted before the category was abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2010/07/19/128616585/from-acapulco-gold-to-alino-rhino-the-marijuana-trademark-land-rush|title=From Acapulco Gold To Albino Rhino: The Marijuana Trademark Land Rush|last=Goldstein|first=Jacob|date=July 19, 2010|publisher=NPR|accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 1970s, as much as 20 percent of the Mexican marijuana being imported into the US was contaminated with the herbicide [[paraquat]], which caused the plants to turn golden. This increased demand for the contaminated marijuana by causing it to be mistaken for higher-quality Acapulco Gold.  The contamination was the result of a drug eradication program being carried on by the Mexican government to which the United States contributed $13 million annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1978/03/11/a-tarnish-on-the-acapulco-gold/aec335a9-5742-483a-b38d-0c174e50cbc5/|title=A Tarnish on the Acapulco Gold|last=Darling|first=Lynn|date=March 11, 1978|publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]''|accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mexican Army had previously burned many of the original Acapulco Gold fields in 1967 at the urging of the US government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c487w9PuJOgC&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;ots=f8UNQasiIY&amp;dq=%22acapulco%20gold%22%20berkeley&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q=%22acapulco%20gold%22%20berkeley&amp;f=false|title=Hippie Dictionary: A Cultural Encyclopedia of the 1960s and 1970s|last=Mccleary|first=John Bassett|date=May 22, 2013|publisher=Potter/TenSpeed/Harmony|page=3|accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acapulco Gold was one of the parents of the hybrid Skunk No. 1, which was called "the backbone of the modern cannabis breeding world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LKZj7SczfmkC&amp;lpg=PA14&amp;dq=%22acapulco%20gold%22&amp;pg=PA14#v=onepage&amp;q=%22acapulco%20gold%22&amp;f=false|title=The Cannabible|last=King|first=Jason|date=April 13, 2011|publisher=Potter/TenSpeed/Harmony|page=161|accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, ''[[High Times]]'' magazine named Acapulco Gold one of the greatest strains of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hightimes.com/grow/25-greatest-strains-of-all-time/|title=25 Greatest Strains of All Time|last=Escondido|first=Nico|date=October 9, 2014|publisher=''[[High Times]]''|accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given its status as an icon of the counterculture movement, Acapulco Gold appeared prominently in American literature during its heyday. The 1972 novel ''Acapulco Gold'' by [[Edwin Corley]] posited that marijuana would be legalized in the near future and depicted the competition among advertising agencies to secure the first marketing account for marijuana cigarettes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/edwin-corley-2/acapulco-gold/|title=Acapulco Gold|date=October 16, 1972|publisher=[[Kirkus Reviews]]|accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protagonists in [[Roberto Bolaño]]'s novel ''[[The Savage Detectives]]''  were undiscovered writers who began trafficking in Acapulco Gold in order to fund a literary magazine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/03/26/vagabonds|title=Vagabonds: Roberto Bolaño and his fractured masterpiece|last=Zalewski|first=Daniel|date=March 26, 2007|publisher=''The New Yorker''|accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Acapulco Gold cigarettes are described as a top brand in [[David Gerrold]]'s [[Nebula Award]]-winning fix-up ''[[When HARLIE Was One]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corvallisadvocate.com/2015/legal-weed-used-to-be-sci-fi/|title=Legal Weed Used to Be Sci-Fi|last=Burt|first=John|date=July 1, 2015|publisher=''Corvallis Advocate''|accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the strain received its greatest tribute in [[Norman Spinrad]]'s 1969 novel ''[[Bug Jack Barron]]''.  Spinrad's work described a futuristic United States where marijuana usage was not only legal but commonplace, with its users including senior elected officials and major celebrities, and where the leading brand was Acapulco Golds, which were promoted on national television with [[Juan Valdez]]-style advertising:
&lt;blockquote&gt;

Cut to same peon cutting a stand of marijuana with a sickle and loading it onto burro: "Prized for its superior flavour and properties, Acapulco Gold was available only to the favoured few due to its rarity and..." Roll to border patrolman frisking unsavoury Pancho Villa type Mexican: "the difficulties involved in importation."

Linguist Jean-Charles Seigneuret attributed the strain's literary popularity to its role as a "psychedelic Philosopher's Stone" which served "to transform the metaphorical lead of the harried, detribalized modern conscience into the 'gold' latent in 'Acapulco gold.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OCHXr3RIETQC&amp;lpg=PA30&amp;ots=U0iDhlYUc-&amp;dq=%22acapulco%20gold%22%20literature&amp;pg=PA30#v=onepage&amp;q=%22acapulco%20gold%22%20literature&amp;f=false|title=Dictionary of Literary Themes and Motifs, Volume 1|last=Seigneuret|first=Jean-Charles|date=1988|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|page=30|accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Animal sacrifice''' is the [[ritual]] killing and offering of an animal usually as part of a [[religious]] [[ritual]] or to appease or maintain favour with a [[deity]]. Animal sacrifices were common throughout [[Europe]] and the [[Ancient Near East]] until [[Late Antiquity]], and continue in some cultures or religions today. [[Human sacrifice]], where it existed, was always much more rare. 

All or only part of a sacrificial animal may be offered; some cultures, like the ancient and modern Greeks, eat most of the edible parts of the sacrifice in a feast, and burnt the rest as an offering. Others, including the [[ancient Hebrews]], burnt the whole animal offering, called a [[Holocaust (sacrifice)|holocaust]].  

Animal sacrifice should generally be distinguished from the religiously-prescribed methods of [[ritual slaughter]] of animals for normal consumption as food.

[[File:Sassari - Complesso prenuragico di Monte d'Accoddi (30).JPG|thumb|One of the [[altar]]s at the [[Monte d'Accoddi]] in [[Sardinia]], where animal sacrifice may have occurred.]]
During the [[Neolithic Revolution]], early humans began to move from [[hunter-gatherer]] cultures toward [[history of agriculture|agriculture]], leading to the spread of [[animal domestication]]. In a theory presented in ''[[Homo Necans]]'', mythologist [[Walter Burkert]] suggests that the ritual sacrifice of [[livestock]] may have developed as a continuation of ancient [[Hunting#History|hunting rituals]], as livestock replaced [[Game (hunting)|wild game]] in the food supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | year = 1983 | title = Homo Necans: The Anthropology of Ancient Greek Sacrificial Ritual and Myth| others = trans. Peter Bing | publisher = University of California | location = Berkeley | isbn = 0-520-05875-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Prehistory==
[[Ancient Egypt]] was at the forefront of domestication, and some of the earliest archeological evidence suggesting animal sacrifice comes from Egypt. The oldest Egyptian burial sites containing animal remains originate from the [[Badari culture]] of [[Upper Egypt]], which flourished between 4400 and 4000 BC.&lt;ref name="flores"&gt;{{cite book |author=Flores, Diane Victoria |title=Funerary Sacrifice of Animals in the Egyptian Predynastic Period |date=2003 |url=https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/bitstream/1807/12533/1/NQ45758.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheep and goats were found buried in their own graves at one site, while at another site [[gazelle]]s were found at the feet of several human burials.&lt;ref name="flores"/&gt; At a cemetery uncovered at [[Hierakonpolis]] and dated to 3000 BC, the remains of a much wider variety of animals were found, including non-domestic species such as [[baboons]] and [[hippopotami]], which may have been sacrificed in honor of powerful former citizens or buried near their former owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|title=In Ancient Egypt, Life Wasn’t Easy for Elite Pets |author=National Geographic|date=2015|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/05/150525-ancient-egypt-zoo-pets-hierakonpolis-baboons-archaeology/}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Herodotus]], later [[List of ancient Egyptian dynasties|Dynastic]] Egyptian animal sacrifice became restricted to livestock - sheep, cattle, swine and geese - with sets of [[ritual]]s and rules to describe each type of sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Herodotus|en|2|38|ref}}, {{Herodotus|en|2|39}},{{Herodotus|en|2|40}},{{Herodotus|en|2|41}},{{Herodotus|en|2|42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of [[chalcolithic|Copper Age]] in 3000 BC, animal sacrifice had become a common practice across many cultures, and appeared to have become more generally restricted to domestic livestock. At [[Gath (city)|Gath]], archeological evidence indicates that the [[Canaanites]] imported sacrificial sheep and goats from Egypt rather than selecting from their own livestock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|title=Ancient Canaanites Imported Animals from Egypt |author=[[Archaeological Institute of America]]|date=2016|url=http://www.archaeology.org/news/4599-160624-israel-imported-animals}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Monte d'Accoddi]] in [[Sardinia]], one of the earliest known sacred centers in Europe, evidence of the sacrifice of sheep, cattle and swine has been uncovered by excavations, and it is indicated that ritual sacrifice may have been common across Italy around 3000 BC and afterwards.&lt;ref name="jones"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jones O'Day |first=Sharyn |last2=Van Neer |first2=Wim |last3=Ervynck |first3=Anton |year=2004 |title=Behaviour Behind Bones: The Zooarchaeology of Ritual, Religion, Status and Identity |publisher=Oxbow Books |isbn=1-84217-113-5 |pp=35–41 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ei9ADgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA76 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] settlement of [[Phaistos]] in ancient [[Crete]], excavations have revealed basins for animal sacrifice dating to the period 2000 to 1700 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://themodernantiquarian.com/site/10857/phaistos.html#fieldnotes C.Michael Hogan, ''Knossos Fieldnotes'', The Modern Antiquarian (2007)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416164450/http://themodernantiquarian.com/site/10857/phaistos.html#fieldnotes |date=April 16, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient Near East==
Animal sacrifice was general among the [[ancient Near East]]ern civilizations of [[Ancient Mesopotamia]], [[Egypt]] and Persia, as well as the Hebrews (covered below).  Unlike the Greeks, who had worked out a justification for keeping the best edible parts of the sacrifice for the assembled humans to eat, in these cultures the whole animal was normally placed on the fire by the altar and burned, or sometimes it was buried.&lt;ref&gt;Burkert (1972), pp. 8-9, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MkqcxK7i0ggC&amp;printsec=frontcover google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient Greece==
[[File:Sacrifice to Athena, Amphora from Vulci, 550-540 BC, Berlin F 1686, 141662.jpg|thumb|left|A bull is led to the altar of [[Athena]], whose image is at right.  Vase, c. 545 BC.]]
Worship in [[ancient Greek religion]] typically consisted of sacrificing domestic animals at the altar with hymn and prayer. The altar was outside any temple building, and might not be associated with a temple at all. The animal, which should be perfect of its kind, is decorated with garlands and the like, and led in procession to the altar, a girl with a basket on her head containing the concealed knife leading the way.  After various rituals the animal is slaughtered over the altar, as it falls all the women present "must cry out in high, shrill tones".  Its blood is collected and poured over the altar. It is butchered on the spot and various internal organs, bones and other inedible parts burnt as the deity's portion of the offering, while the meat is removed to be prepared for the participants to eat; the leading figures tasting it on the spot. The temple usually kept the skin, to sell to tanners. That the humans got more use from the sacrifice than the deity had not escaped the Greeks, and is often the subject of humour in [[Greek comedy]].&lt;ref&gt;Burkert (1985), 2:1:1, 2:1:2.  For more exotic local forms of sacrifice, see the [[Laphria (festival)]], [[Xanthika]], and [[Lykaia]].  The advantageous division of the animal was supposed to go back to [[Prometheus]]'s trick on Zeus]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The animals used are, in order of preference, bull or ox, cow, sheep (the most common), goat, pig (with piglet the cheapest mammal), and poultry (but rarely other birds or fish).&lt;ref&gt;Burkert (1985): 2:1:1; to some extent different animals were thought appropriate for different deities, from bulls for Zeus and Poseidon to doves for Aphrodite, Burkert (1985): 2:1:4&lt;/ref&gt;  Horses and asses are seen on some [[Pottery_of_ancient_Greece#Geometric_style|vases in the Geometric style]] (900-750 BC), but are very rarely mentioned in literature; they were relatively late introductions to Greece, and it has been suggested that Greek preferences in this matter go very far back.  The Greeks liked to believe that the animal was glad to be sacrificed, and interpreted various behaviours as showing this. [[Divination]] by examining parts of the sacrificed animal was much less important than in Roman or [[Etruscan religion]], or Near Eastern religions, but [[Greek divination|was practiced]], especially of the liver, and as part of the cult of Apollo. Generally, the Greeks put more faith in observing the behaviour of birds.&lt;ref&gt;Struck, P.T. (2014). "Animals and Divination", In Campbell, G.L. (Ed.), ''The Oxford Handbook of Animals in Classical Thought and Life'', 2014, Oxford University Press. DOI: 10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199589425.013.019, [https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1186&amp;context=classics_papers online]&lt;/ref&gt;  For a smaller and simpler offering, a grain of [[incense]] could be thrown on the sacred fire,&lt;ref&gt;Burkert (1985): 2:1:2&lt;/ref&gt; and outside the cities farmers made simple sacrificial gifts of plant produce as the "first fruits" were harvested.&lt;ref&gt;Burkert (1985): 2:1:4&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the grand form of sacrifice called the [[hecatomb]] (meaning 100 bulls) might in practice only involve a dozen or so, at large festivals the number of cattle sacrificed could run into the hundreds, and the numbers feasting on them well into the thousands.  The enormous [[Hellenistic]] structures of the [[Altar of Hieron]] and [[Pergamon Altar]] were built for such occasions.
[[File:Greekreligion-animalsacrifice-corinth-6C-BCE.jpg|thumb|Sacrifice of a lamb on [[Pitsa panels|a Pitsa Panel]], [[Corinth]], 540–530 BC]]

The evidence of the existence of such practices is clear in some ancient Greek literature, especially in [[Homer]]'s epics. Throughout the poems, the use of the ritual is apparent at banquets where meat is served, in times of danger or before some important endeavor to gain the favor of the gods. For example, in Homer's ''[[Odyssey]]'' [[Eumaeus]] sacrifices a pig with prayer for his unrecognizable master Odysseus. However, in Homer's ''[[Iliad]]'', which partly reflects very early Greek civilization, not every banquet of the princes begins with a sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Hitch, ''King of Sacrifice: Ritual and Royal Authority in the Iliad'', [https://chs.harvard.edu/CHS/article/display/6164.1-defining-homeric-sacrifice online at] Harvard University's Center for Hellenic Studies&lt;/ref&gt;

These sacrificial practices, described in these pre-Homeric eras, share commonalities to the 8th century forms of sacrificial rituals. Furthermore, throughout the poem, special banquets are held whenever gods indicated their presence by some sign or success in war. Before setting out for Troy, this type of animal sacrifice is offered. Odysseus offers Zeus a sacrificial ram in vain. The occasions of sacrifice in Homer's epic poems may shed some light onto the view of the gods as members of society, rather than as external entities, indicating social ties. Sacrificial rituals played a major role in forming the relationship between humans and the divine.&lt;ref&gt;Meuli, ''Griechische Opferbräuche'', 1946&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that the [[Chthonic]] deities, distinguished from Olympic deities by typically being offered the holocaust mode of sacrifice, where the offering is wholly burnt, may be remnants of the native [[Pre-Greek substrate|Pre-Hellenic]] religion and that many of the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian]] deities may come from the Proto-Greeks who overran the southern part of the [[Balkans|Balkan Peninsula]] in the late third millennium BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Chadwick|first1=John|title=The Mycenaean World|date=1976|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-521-29037-1|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Hellenistic period]] after the death of [[Alexander the Great]] in 323 BC, [[Hellenistic philosophy|several new philosophical movements]] began to question the ethics of animal sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;Burkert (1972), 6-7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scythians==
According to the unique account by the Greek author [[Herodotus]] (c 484–c 425 BC), the [[Scythians]] sacrificed various kinds of livestock, though the most prestigious offering was considered to be the horse. The pig, on the other hand, was never offered in sacrifice, and apparently the Scythians were loath to keep swine within their lands.&lt;ref name="Macaulay 1904:315"&gt;Macaulay (1904:315).&lt;/ref&gt; Herodotus describes the Scythian manner of sacrifice as follows:

{{quote|The victim stands with its fore-feet tied, and the sacrificing priest stands behind the victim, and by pulling the end of the cord he throws the beast down; and as the victim falls, he calls upon the god to whom he is sacrificing, and then at once throws a noose round its neck, and putting a small stick into it he turns it round and so strangles the animal, without either lighting a fire or making any first offering from the victim or pouring any libation over it: and when he has strangled it and flayed off the skin, he proceeds to boil it. [...] Then when the flesh is boiled, the sacrificer takes a first offering of the flesh and of the vital organs and casts it in front of him.&lt;ref name="Macaulay 1904:314"&gt;Macaulay (1904:314).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Herodotus goes on to describe the human sacrifice of prisoners, conducted in a different manner.

The most potent offering in [[Ancient Roman religion]] was animal sacrifice, typically of domesticated animals such as cattle, sheep and pigs. Each was the best specimen of its kind, cleansed, clad in sacrificial regalia and garlanded; the horns of oxen might be gilded. Sacrifice sought the [[pax deorum|harmonisation of the earthly and divine]], so the victim must seem willing to offer its own life on behalf of the community; it must remain calm and be quickly and cleanly dispatched.&lt;ref&gt;Halm, in Rüpke (ed), 239.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sacrifice to deities of the heavens (''di superi'', "gods above") was performed in daylight, and under the public gaze. Deities of the upper heavens required white, infertile victims of their own sex: [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] a white heifer (possibly a white cow); [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] a white, castrated ox (''bos mas'') for the annual oath-taking by the [[Roman consul|consuls]]. ''Di superi'' with strong connections to the earth, such as Mars, Janus, Neptune and various ''[[Genius (mythology)|genii]]'' – including the Emperor's – were offered fertile victims. After the sacrifice, a banquet was held; in state cults, the images of honoured deities took pride of place on banqueting couches and by means of the sacrificial fire consumed their proper portion (''[[exta]]'', the innards). Rome's officials and priests reclined in order of precedence alongside and ate the meat; lesser citizens may have had to provide their own.&lt;ref name="Scheid, in Rüpke ed, 263 - 271"&gt;Scheid, in Rüpke (ed), 263 - 271.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chthonic]] gods such as [[Dis pater]], the ''[[di inferi]]'' ("gods below"), and the collective shades of the departed ''([[Manes|di Manes]])'' were given dark, fertile victims in nighttime rituals. Animal sacrifice usually took the form of a [[holocaust (sacrifice)|holocaust]] or burnt offering, and there was no shared banquet, as "the living cannot share a meal with the dead".&lt;ref&gt;Though the household Lares do just that, and at least some Romans understood them to be ancestral spirits. Sacrifices to the spirits of deceased mortals are discussed below in [[Religion in ancient Rome#Funerals and the afterlife|Funerals and the afterlife]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]] and other underworld goddesses of fruitfulness were sometimes offered pregnant female animals; [[Terra (mythology)|Tellus]] was given a pregnant cow at the [[Fordicidia]] festival. Color had a general symbolic value for sacrifices. Demigods and heroes, who belonged to the heavens and the underworld, were sometimes given black-and-white victims. [[Robigo]] (or [[Robigus]]) was given red dogs and libations of red wine at the [[Robigalia]] for the protection of crops from blight and red mildew.&lt;ref name="Scheid, in Rüpke ed, 263 - 271"/&gt;

A sacrifice might be made in thanksgiving or as an [[expiation]] of a sacrilege or potential sacrilege (''[[:wikt:piaculum|piaculum]]'');&lt;ref&gt;Jörg Rüpke, ''Religion of the Romans'' (Polity Press, 2007, originally published in German 2001), p. 81 [https://books.google.com/books?id=fcsynr0fQIoC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;dq=piaculum&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=piaculum&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;
a ''piaculum'' might also be offered as a sort of advance payment; the [[Arval Brethren]], for instance, offered a ''piaculum'' before entering their [[sacred grove]] with an iron implement, which was forbidden, as well as after.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Warde Fowler]], ''The Religious Experience of the Roman People'' (London, 1922), p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The pig was a common victim for a ''piaculum''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert E.A. Palmer]], "The Deconstruction of Mommsen on Festus 462/464 L, or the Hazards of Interpretation", in ''Imperium sine fine: T. Robert S. Broughton and the Roman Republic'' (Franz Steiner, 1996), p. 99, note 129 [https://books.google.com/books?id=wEtE8c1jGY4C&amp;pg=PA99&amp;dq=piaculum&amp;cd=6#v=onepage&amp;q=piaculum&amp;f=false online]; Roger D. Woodard, ''Indo-European Sacred Space: Vedic and Roman Cult'' (University of Illinois Press, 2006), p. 122 [https://books.google.com/books?id=EB4fB0inNYEC&amp;pg=PA122&amp;dq=piaculum&amp;lr=&amp;cd=16#v=onepage&amp;q=piaculum&amp;f=false online.]  The [[Augustus|Augustan]] historian [[Livy]] (8.9.1–11) says [[Publius Decius Mus (consul 340 BC)|P. Decius Mus]] is "like" a ''piaculum'' when he makes his vow to sacrifice himself in battle (''[[devotio]]'').&lt;/ref&gt;

The same divine agencies who caused disease or harm also had the power to avert it, and so might be placated in advance. Divine consideration might be sought to avoid the inconvenient delays of a journey, or encounters with banditry, piracy and shipwreck, with due gratitude to be rendered on safe arrival or return. In times of great crisis, the Senate could decree collective public rites, in which Rome's citizens, including women and children, moved in procession from one temple to the next, supplicating the gods.&lt;ref&gt;Hahn, in Rüpke (ed), 238.&lt;/ref&gt;

Extraordinary circumstances called for extraordinary sacrifice: in one of the many crises of the [[Second Punic War]], Jupiter Capitolinus was promised every animal born that spring (see ''[[ver sacrum]]''), to be rendered after five more years of protection from [[Hannibal]] and his allies.&lt;ref&gt;Beard et al., Vol 1, 32-36.&lt;/ref&gt; The "contract" with Jupiter is exceptionally detailed. All due care would be taken of the animals. If any died or were stolen before the scheduled sacrifice, they would count as already sacrificed, since they had already been consecrated. Normally, if the gods failed to keep their side of the bargain, the offered sacrifice would be withheld. In the imperial period, sacrifice was withheld following [[Trajan]]'s death because the gods had not kept the Emperor safe for the stipulated period.&lt;ref&gt;Gradel, 21: but this need not imply sacrifice as a mutual contract, breached in this instance. Evidently the gods had the greater power and freedom of choice in the matter. See Beard et al., 34: "The gods would accept as sufficient exactly what they were offered - no more, no less." Human error in the previous annual vows and sacrifice remains a possibility.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Pompeii]], the Genius of the living emperor was offered a bull: presumably a standard practise in Imperial cult, though minor offerings (incense and wine) were also made.&lt;ref&gt;Gradel, 78, 93&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''exta'' were the entrails of a sacrificed animal, comprising in [[Cicero]]'s enumeration the gall bladder (''fel''), liver (''iecur''), heart (''cor''), and lungs (''pulmones'').&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De divinatione'' 2.12.29. According to [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] (''Natural History'' 11.186), before 274 BC the heart was not included among the ''exta''.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''exta'' were exposed for [[litatio]] (divine approval) as part of Roman liturgy, but were "read" in the context of the ''[[disciplina Etrusca]]''. As a product of Roman sacrifice, the ''exta'' and blood are reserved for the gods, while the meat ''(viscera)'' is shared among human beings in a communal meal. The ''exta'' of bovine victims were usually stewed in a pot (''[[Olla (Roman pot)|olla]]'' or ''aula''), while those of sheep or pigs were grilled on skewers. When the deity's portion was cooked, it was sprinkled with ''[[mola salsa]]'' (ritually prepared salted flour) and wine, then placed in the fire on the altar for the offering; the technical verb for this action was ''[[:wikt:porricere|porricere]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Schilling, "The Roman Religion", in ''Historia Religionum: Religions of the Past'' (Brill, 1969), vol. 1, pp. 471–472, and "Roman Sacrifice," ''Roman and European Mythologies'' (University of Chicago Press, 1992), p. 79; [[John Scheid]], ''An Introduction to Roman Religion'' (Indiana University Press, 2003, originally published in French 1998), p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iron Age Europe==
Too little is known about either [[Celtic paganism]] or [[Germanic paganism|the earlier Germanic equivalent]] to be confident about their practices, other than the claims of Roman sources that [[human sacrifice]] was included - they do not bother to report on the less sensational sacrifice of animals.  In the rather later [[Norse paganism]], the [[blót]] sacrifice and feast is better recorded.  Like the Greeks, the Norse seem to have eaten most of the sacrifice; human prisoners were also sometimes sacrificed.

{{Main|Slaughter offering|Korban}}
In [[Judaism]], the ''qorban'' is any of a variety of [[Sacrifice|sacrificial offerings]] described and commanded in the [[Torah]]. The most common usages are animal sacrifice (''zevah'' זֶבַח), ''zevah shelamim'' (the [[peace offering]]) and ''olah'' (the "[[Holocaust (sacrifice)|holocaust]]" or [[Burnt_offering_(Judaism)|burnt offering]]). A ''qorban'' was an animal sacrifice, such as a bull, sheep, goat, or a dove that underwent ''[[shechita]]'' (Jewish ritual slaughter). Sacrifices could also consist grain, meal, wine, or incense.&lt;ref name="straightdope.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewsforjudaism.org/knowledge/articles/answers/jewish-polemics/texts/scriptural-studies/leviticus-1711/|title=Jews For Judaism|author=Rabbi Zalman Kravitz|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://beithamikdash.org.il/%D7%A7%D7%A8%D7%91%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%AA/%D7%A2%D7%91%D7%95%D7%93%D7%95%D7%AA-%D7%94%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%91%D7%9F{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hebrew Bible]] says that [[Yahweh]] commanded the [[Israelites]] to offer offerings and sacrifices on various altars. The sacrifices were only to be offered by the hands of the Kohanim. Before building the [[Temple in Jerusalem]], when the Israelites were in the [[desert]], sacrifices were offered only in the [[Tabernacle]]. After building [[Solomon's Temple]], sacrifices were allowed only there. After the Temple was destroyed, sacrifices was resumed when the [[Second Temple]] was built until it was also destroyed in 70 CE. After the destruction of the Second Temple sacrifices were prohibited because there was no longer a Temple, the only place allowed by ''[[halakha]]'' for sacrifices. Offering of sacrifices was briefly reinstated during the [[Jewish–Roman wars]] of the second century CE and was continued in certain communities thereafter.&lt;ref name="jewfaq.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewfaq.org/qorbanot.htm|title=Judaism 101: Qorbanot: Sacrifices and Offerings|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="straightdope.com"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zotti|first1=Ed (ed.)|url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2091/why-do-jews-no-longer-sacrifice-animals|title=Why do Jews no longer sacrifice animals?|publisher=The Straight Dope}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://the-tabernacle-place.com/articles/what_is_the_tabernacle|title=What is the Tabernacle of Moses?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
[[File:Matagh (Animal Sacrifice) - Armenia 2009.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Matagh of a rooster at the entrance of a monastery church ([[Alaverdi, Armenia]], 2009), with inset of bloody steps.]]
{{Further|Lamb of God}}
References to animal sacrifice appear in the [[New Testament]], such as the parents of [[Jesus]] sacrificing two doves ({{bibleverse||Luke|2:24}}) and the Apostle Paul performing a [[Nazirite]] vow even after the death of Christ ({{bibleverse||Acts|21:23-26}}).

Christ is referred to by his apostles as "the [[Lamb of God]]", the one to whom all sacrifices pointed (Hebrews 10).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+10 “Christ’s Sacrifice Once for All”] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160623214834/https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+10 |date=June 23, 2016 }}, ”Bible Gateway”, March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[penal substitution]] theory of [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]], Christ's crucifixion is comparable to animal sacrifice on a large scale as his death serves as a substitutionary punishment for all of humanity's sins.

Though never a part of the doctrine or theology of any Christian group (and often attracting criticism), some rural Christian communities have continued to sacrifice animals (which are then consumed in a feast) as part of worship, especially at [[Easter]].  The animal may be brought into the church before being taken out again and killed. Some villages in Greece sacrifice animals to Orthodox saints in a practice known as [[kourbania]]. Sacrifice of a lamb, or less commonly a rooster, is a common practice in [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Church]],&lt;ref&gt;Burkert (1972), pp. 8-9, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MkqcxK7i0ggC&amp;printsec=frontcover google books]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Tewahedo Orthodox|Tewahedo Church]] of [[Ethiopia]] and [[Eritrea]]. This tradition, called [[matagh]], is believed to stem from pre-Christian pagan rituals. Additionally, some Mayans following a form of [[Folk Catholicism]] in Mexico today still sacrifice animals in conjunction with church practices, a ritual practiced in past religions before the arrival of the Spaniards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vagabondjourney.com/maya-and-catholic-religious-syncretism-at-chamula-mexico/ |title=Maya and Catholic Religious Syncretism at Chamula, Mexico |publisher=Vagabondjourney.com |date=2011-11-26 |accessdate=2014-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Strangite Latter Day Saints====
Animal sacrifice was instituted in the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite)]], a minor Latter Day Saint faction founded by [[James J. Strang]] in 1844.  Strang's  [[Book of the Law of the Lord]] (1851) deals with the topic of animal sacrifice in chapters 7 and 40.

Given the prohibition on sacrifices for sin contained in III Nephi 9:19-20 ([[Book of Mormon]]), Strang did not require sin offerings. Rather, he focused on sacrifice as an element of religious celebrations,&lt;ref&gt;Book of the Law, pp. 293-97. See also http://www.strangite.org/Offering.htm{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt; especially the commemoration of his own [[coronation]] as king over his church, which occurred on July 8, 1850.&lt;ref&gt;Book of the Law, pg. 293.&lt;/ref&gt; The head of every house, from the king to his lowest subject, was to offer "a heifer, or a lamb, or a dove. Every man a clean beast, or a clean fowl, according to his household."&lt;ref&gt;Book of the Law, pp. 293-94.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the killing of sacrifices was a prerogative of Strangite priests,&lt;ref&gt;Book of the Law, pg. 199, note 2.&lt;/ref&gt; female priests were specifically barred from participating in this aspect of the priestly office.&lt;ref&gt;Book of the Law, pg. 199. Unlike other Latter Day Saint organizations at this time, Strang permitted women to serve as Priests and Teachers in his priesthood.&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Firstfruits]]" offerings were also demanded of all Strangite agricultural harvests.&lt;ref&gt;Book of the Law, pp. 295-97.&lt;/ref&gt; Animal sacrifices are no longer practiced by the Strangite organization, though belief in their correctness is still required.

Neither [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] nor the [[Community of Christ]], the two largest Latter Day Saint factions, ever accepted Strang's teachings on this (or any other) subject.

There are [[Hindu temple]]s in [[Assam]] and [[West Bengal]] India and [[Nepal]] where [[goat]]s, [[chicken]]s and sometimes [[Water buffalo]]s are sacrificed. These sacrifices are performed  mainly  at temples following the [[Shakti]] school of [[Hinduism]] where the female nature of [[Brahman]] is worshipped in the form of [[Kali]] and [[Durga]]. There are many village temples in Tamil Nadu where this kind of sacrifice takes place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://epaper.timesofindia.com/Daily/skins/TOI/navigator.asp?Daily=TOICH&amp;login=default Times of India, Chennai Edition, 4 May 2008]{{dead link|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, ritual of animal sacrifice is practised in many villages before local deities or certain powerful and terrifying forms of the [[Devi]]. In this form of worship, animals, usually goats, are decapitated and the blood is offered to deity often by smearing some of it on a post outside the temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= James G.

Every year, animals like goat and fowl are sacrificed before the deity on the occasion of her annual ''Yatra''/''Jatra'' (festival) held in the month of ''Aswina'' (September–October). The main attraction of ''Kandhen Budhi Yatra'' is ''Ghusuri Puja''. ''Ghusuri'' means a child pig, which is sacrificed to the goddess every three years. Kandhen Budhi is also worshipped at Lather village under Mohangiri GP in Kalahandi district of Orissa, India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/2009/September/engpdf/20-24.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318073208/http://orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/2009/September/engpdf/20-24.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;(Pasayat, 2009:20-24).{{full citation|date= January 2015}}

'''''Argyreia nervosa''''' is a [[perennial plant|perennial]] climbing [[vine]] native to the [[Indian subcontinent]] and introduced to numerous areas worldwide, including [[Hawaii]], [[Africa]], and the [[Caribbean]].

Common names include '''Hawaiian baby woodrose''', '''adhoguda''' अधोगुडा or '''vidhara''' विधारा (Sanskrit), '''elephant creeper''' and '''woolly morning glory'''. Its seeds are known for their powerful entheogenic value, greater or similar to its varieties from [[Convolvulaceae]] family, with the users reporting significant psychedelic and spiritual experiences &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=E.

While several other plants in the [[Convolvulaceae]] family, such as  ''[[Rivea corymbosa]]'' (ololiuhqui) and ''[[Ipomoea tricolor]]'' (tlitliltzin), were used in shamanic rituals of [[Latin America]] for centuries, ''A. nervosa'' was not traditionally used for this purpose. Its properties were first brought to attention in the 1960s.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

== Cultivation ==
Where temperatures fall below 13&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C (55&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;F), grow in a warm [[greenhouse]]. Elsewhere, grow on an arbour, [[pergola]], or wall, or through a tree. Under glass, grow in a [[loam]]-based potting compost ([[John Innes compost|John Innes]] No. 3) in full light. From spring to autumn, water freely and apply a balanced liquid fertilizer monthly; reduce water in winter. Outdoors, grow in moderately fertile, moist but well-drained soil in full sun. Pruning group 11, in late winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Royal Horticultural Society: A-Z Encyclopedia Of Garden Plants|last=Brickell|first=Christopher|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|year=2016|isbn=9780241239124|location=Great Britain|pages=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They contain [[ergoline|ergot alkaloids]] varying considerably in concentration with LSA weight ranging between exactly similar looking seeds from 3 μg to 34 μg (avg 17 μg).&lt;ref name="Dose"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Paulke |first1=Alexander |last2=Kremer |first2=Christian |last3=Wunder |first3=Cora |last4=Wurglics |first4=Mario |last5=Schubert-Zsilavecz |first5=Manfred |last6=Toennes |first6=Stefan W. |title=Identification of legal highs--ergot alkaloid patterns in two Argyreia nervosa products |journal=Forensic Science International |date=2014 |volume=242 |pages=62–71 |doi=10.1016/j.forsciint.2014.06.025 |pmid=25036782 |issn=1872-6283}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in its effects, LSA is about one tenth as potent as its cousin LSD, making a threshold dose level for LSA about 500 μg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wasson |first1=R.

==Early Phase==

===`Abdu'l-Bahá's Tablets of the Divine Plan===
[[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] wrote a series of letters, or [[tablets (religious)|tablets]], to the followers of the religion in the [[United States]] in 1916-1917; these letters were compiled together in the book ''[[Tablets of the Divine Plan]]''. The eighth and twelfth of the tablets mentioned [[Africa]] and were written on April 19, 1916 and February 15, 1917, respectively. Publication however was delayed in the United States until 1919—after the end of the [[World War I|First World War]] and the [[Spanish flu]]. The tablets were translated and presented by [[Mirza Ahmad Sohrab]] on April 4, 1919, and published in ''[[Star of the West (Bahá'í magazine)|Star of the West]]'' magazine on December 12, 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Abbas | first = `Abdu'l-Bahá |others=Mirza Ahmad Sohrab (trans. and comments) | title = Tablets, Instructions and Words of Explanation |date=April 1919 | url = http://bahai-library.com/abdulbaha_tablets_instructions_explanation}}&lt;/ref&gt; `Abdu'l-Bahá mentions Bahá'ís traveling "…especially from America to Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia, and travel through Japan and China. Likewise, from Germany teachers and believers may travel to the continents of America, Africa, Japan and China; in brief, they may travel through all the continents and islands of the globe"&lt;ref name="ToDP8"/&gt; and " …the anthem of the oneness of the world of humanity may confer a new life upon all the children of men, and the tabernacle of universal peace be pitched on the apex of America; thus Europe and Africa may become vivified with the breaths of the Holy Spirit, this world may become another world, the body politic may attain to a new exhilaration…."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = `Abdu'l-Bahá |authorlink = `Abdu'l-Bahá |year = 1991|title = Tablets of the Divine Plan|edition = Paperback |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location = Wilmette, IL |isbn = 0-87743-233-3 |url =http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/TDP/tdp-12.html.iso8859-1 | pages = 82–89 |origyear = 1916-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Establishment of the community===
The religion arrived in the area during the end of the era of the [[Bechuanaland Protectorate]], the predecessor colonial country, under the [[Union of South Africa]].  In 1953 [[Shoghi Effendi]], head of the religion after the death of `Abdu'l-Bahá, planned an international teaching plan termed the [[Ten Year Crusade]].&lt;ref name ="history"/&gt;  During the plan pioneers moved to many countries including Botswana from places. This was during a period of wide scale growth in the religion across [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] near the end of the period of [[Colonisation of Africa]].&lt;ref name="UofC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview Of World Religions |work=General Essay on the Religions of Sub-Saharan Africa |publisher=Division of Religion and Philosophy, [[University of Cumbria]] |url=http://philtar.ucsm.ac.uk/encyclopedia/sub/geness.html |accessdate=2008-04-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209082606/http://philtar.ucsm.ac.uk/encyclopedia/sub/geness.html |archivedate=2007-12-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of establishing a Bahá'í presence in Bechuanaland was assigned to the National Assembly of Iran then still in operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Guardian's Message to the Africa Intercontinnental Conference| journal = Bahá'í News |date=March 1953 | pages = 1–3| url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=03&amp;page=863| issue = 281| issn=0195-9212}}&lt;/ref&gt; However by November 1953 recent arrivals the Johnsons from America then in South Africa saw the arrival of John and Audrey&lt;ref name="BN281"&gt;{{cite journal | title =  Pioneer Letters; Excerpts from Pioneer Letter to the Africa Teaching Committee; ''Johannesburg, March, 1954''| journal = Bahá'í News |date=July 1954 | page = 6 | url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=04&amp;page=6| issue = 281| issn=0195-9212}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robarts and son Patrick and daughter Nina from Canada who were assisted in reaching [[Mafeking]]&lt;ref name="BN279"&gt;{{cite journal | title =  Pioneer Letters; Excerpts from Pioneer Letter to the Africa Teaching Committee; ''Edith and Lowell Johnson, Cape Town, South Africa''| journal = Bahá'í News |date=June 1954 |page = 15 | url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=03&amp;page=1063|issue = 280| issn=0195-9212}}&lt;/ref&gt; (then in Bechuanaland) as Bahá'í [[Pioneering (Bahá'í)|pioneers]] where they arrived by October 1954&lt;ref name="BN280"/&gt; and were recognized as the first Bahá'ís to the country earning the title [[Knight of Bahá'u'lláh]] from the then head of the Faith, Shoghi Effendi.&lt;ref name="Golden"/&gt; The Robarts had joined the religion in 1938 and when the first National Spiritual Assembly of Canada was formed in 1948, John was elected chairman, a post he held until 1953 when they moved.&lt;ref name="StLucia"&gt;{{cite web

 | format =pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954 [[Hand of the Cause]], [[Musa Banani]] appointed John as an [[Bahá'í administration#Auxiliary Boards|Auxiliary Board Member]] and the family went on [[Bahá'í pilgrimage]]. In 2005 Lally Warren recalled that as a young child in Mafikeng it had been unusual to meet white people who were pleasant to her so she believed that all white people were bad.&lt;ref name="Golden"/&gt; That changed when she met the Robarts family. "The Robarts didn't treat me like a black child, they treated me as a child," she said. She recalled when she was 10 and the Robarts family came to her house for meetings with her parents, James and Stella Moncho, the first local couple to become Bahá'ís, "They could only do this at night, and as they came towards the house they would switch their [car] lights on and off to say, 'Is it ok, is it safe, can we come?'…There was no electricity in the black area during those days so my mother would take a lantern and stick it out through the window and wave it to say, 'OK, it's safe for you to come.'"&lt;ref name="Golden"/&gt;

The Robarts family befriended Modiri Molema, a highly respected medical doctor and the only black man who was permitted to associate with whites.&lt;ref name="Golden"/&gt; Dr. Molema invited his friends and family to hear about the religion, and he gave the Robarts family letters of introduction to the [[Kgosi]] (traditional chiefs) of the Bechuanaland Protectorate. Dr. Molema converted to the religion but his enrollment was not made public because of likely harassment due to his previous high-profile political involvement. In 1955 his relative, Stanlake Kukama, became the first native Tswana of Bechuanaland to become a publicly declared Bahá'í. In 2005 Kukama recalled he had been an anti-apartheid activist, and was a member of the South African political party, the [[African National Congress]] and had detested white people because of their attitude towards Africans but that changed when he heard about the Bahá'í Faith from the Robarts family: "In 1955 I heard of the Bahá'í Faith and [found] the principles of the Faith were the solution to [achieve] peace and harmony for mankind.… I realized that the white and the black were all blind. They did not see the truth, they did not have the eye of the soul. Hence, I became a Bahá'í, and renounced man-made solutions to peace."&lt;ref name="Golden"/&gt; The African National Congress tried to woo back Mr. Kukama for many years without success. The police kept him under surveillance even after he became a Bahá'í because they did not believe that he had given up partisan politics. Mr. Kukama later served for many years both as a member of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of Bophuthatswana and of South Africa.&lt;ref name="Golden"/&gt;

In April 1956 the Bahá'í Faith was present in small numbers across 15 countries of southern Africa. To administer these communities a regional National Spiritual Assembly was elected in South West Africa to cover them.&lt;ref name="stats"/&gt; In 1956 John Robarts was elected to it.&lt;ref name="StLucia"/&gt;

By early 1957 the Bahá'í community numbered between 10 and 20 individuals and became part of the regional national assembly of South and West Africa.  By 1963 there were two assemblies; seven groups, and one isolated member.&lt;ref name="Graham2000"/&gt; The assemblies were in [[Lobatse]], and [[Mahalapye]] and groups in [[Gaborone]], [[Ghanzi]], [[Kopong]], [[Mafeking]], [[Molepolole]], [[Morwa, Botswana|Morwa]], [[Serowe]], and a lone Bahá'í in [[Moeng]] (which is near the [[Tswapong Hills]]).&lt;ref name="stats"/&gt;

==National development==
Following the death of Shoghi Effendi, the elected [[Universal House of Justice]] was head of the religion and began to re-organized the Bahá'í communities of Africa, including Botswana, by splitting off national communities to form their own National Assemblies from 1964 though the 1990s.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web

Hope, and John D. Sargent Sr. There were ten delegates, sixty additional visitors for the fourth annual convention, held in Salisbury, Rhodesia.

In 1970 the first National Youth School in Botswana was attended by over thirty youth, adults and teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = Botswana - First Youth Institute| journal = Bahá'í News |date=December 1970 |page = 11 |url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=07&amp;page=691| issue = 477| issn=0195-9212}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the classes the youth visited three villages previously arranged by the national assembly with the approval of the local chiefs where they presented a well received speech especially prepared for them. Because of the reception of the speech they were invited to a further six villages by the chiefs of those villages ultimately presenting the religion to almost 700 attendees of the presentations. Coverage of the tour was also done on local radio. Later the first Bahá'ís from the [[Bushmen]] and the [[Kgalagadi people|Kgalagadi]] had joined the religion.

The time came for the election of Botswana's Bahá'í [[National Spiritual Assembly]] elected in 1970.&lt;ref name="BN492a"/&gt; Its members in the 1971 re-election were:&lt;ref name="BN492a"/&gt; Stanley Matenge, Esther Moncho, Isaac Kgang, Dennis Makiwa, Maureen Gruber, Robert Sarracino, Bogatlu Pheto, Jeffrey Gruber, and Broer Oageng.

In August 1971 the first public talks on the religion in [[Gaborone]] were undertaken and was broadcast over [[List of radio stations in Africa#.C2.A0Botswana|Radio Botswana]] on the topic of "African Traditional Beliefs and the Unity of the World Religions".&lt;ref name="BN492a"/&gt; A review of the community then noted that the national assembly and five local assemblies had incorporated and registered with the government. The national assembly then became legal owners of the national Bahá'í center. Sixty-seven localities had been introduced to the religion and translations of some Bahá'í scripture had been accomplished. Some forty chiefs at various levels had been sent messages by the national assembly about the religion. Fifty-seven villages had been visited with mass meetings resulting. There were only four pioneers present then. The village of Boneapitse was noted as being a majority of Bahá'ís.

===Visits of Hands of the Cause===

[[Hands of the Cause]] are a select group of Bahá'ís, appointed for life, whose main function was to propagate and protect the religion. In May 1972 [[Hand of the Cause]] [[Adelbert Mühlschlegel]] was the first to tour Botswana.&lt;ref name="BN492b"&gt;{{cite journal |title = Hand of Cause visits Botswana | journal = Bahá'í News |date=March 1972 |pages = 12–13 |url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=08&amp;page=36| issue = 683| issn=0195-9212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1972 [[Hand of the Cause]] [[Enoch Olinga]] toured the country and visited three of the then newest and most active Bahá'í communities in Botswana - [[Ratholo]] and [[Bonwapitse]] (both in the [[Tswapong Hills]] area), and Palla Road (aka [[Dinokwe]]) He reviewed understanding the religion in a non-literalist way, elaborated on the principals of the religion like of [[Bahá'í Faith and the unity of humanity|unity of humanity]], [[Progressive revelation (Bahá'í)|progressive revelation]], and that the religion was present in many countries beyond their lands despite the fact that school books did not mention the religion. Later he gave a public talk entitled "The Bahá'í Faith and the Social Order" and a radio interview in [[Gaborone]] where he addressed wide-ranging topics from the definition of the word "Bahá'í", the [[History of the Bahá'í Faith|history of the religion]], its relationship with [[Bahá'í Faith and the unity of religion|Christianity]] and the difficulties with social norms in [[Bahá'í Faith in South Africa|South Africa]].

In June 1973 Hand of the Cause [[Ruhiyyih Khanum]] toured the country for some 20 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = The Great Safari of Hand of the Cause Ruhiyyih Khanum, part 15  | last = Nakhjavani | first = Violette | journal = Bahá'í News |date=April 1973 |pages = 16–21 |url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=08&amp;page=351| issue = 505| issn=0195-9212}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was met an hour's walk from the village of [[Selebi-Phikwe]] by a new mother with a week-old baby. At a few villages including [[Seleka]] she met with local school teachers. She congratulated the pioneers that were well out in the countryside rather than clustered in the capital. At another village she spoke at a teacher's training college noting the Bahá'í teaching of [[Bahá'í Faith and gender equality|equality of the sexes]] and the importance of mothers and teachers, [[Bahá'í Faith and education|eliminating illiteracy]] but that matters of faith are not dependent on book learning. In [[Bonwapitse]] she addressed the importance of prayer, the meaning of "[[Alláh'u'Abhá]]". In [[Mmutlane]] she addressed the topic of dreams related about [[Bahá'u'lláh]] and the [[Báb]]. She went on to other villages and illustrated diverse responses to faith. In the [[Kalahari Desert]] she met with Bushmen when only a few had joined the religion so far hoping the religion would help preserve their qualities of gentleness and goodness. Then she met with the national assembly especially about the topic of the Bahá'í view of "consultation", that the Bahá'í funds are to be spent on specific purposes for the promulgation of the religion. At [[Lobatse]] she spoke at another teacher's training college on the importance of youth. The final village was [[Sub-districts of Botswana#Southern District|Good Hope]] where she met the first Bahá'ís of Botswana -Mr. and Mrs. Moncho.

In March 1978 Hand of the Cause [[Collis Featherstone|H. Collis Featherstone]] toured Botswana for a week speaking of the Bahá'í views on themes of the religion and presented an address on radio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = Botswana: Hand of the Cause visits  |journal = Bahá'í News |date=September 1978 |page = 13 |url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=09&amp;page=815| issue = 570| issn=0195-9212}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April [[John Robarts (Bahá'í)|John Robarts]], who was appointed a Hand of the Cause in 1957, and his wife Audrey returned to Botswana.

===Sustained women's groups===

In 1975 a pair of women from Rhodesia traveled a few places in the country holding extended classes on the religion in a few locations advancing the activity of women. The pair were joined by a few local youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = Botswana  |journal = Bahá'í News |date=December 1975 |pages = 18–19 |url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=09&amp;page=157| issue = 505| issn=0195-9212}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, in 1976 five handicraft clubs for Bahá'í women were functioning with the assistance of Iran Sohaili from Rhodesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = Clubs for Bahá'í women organized  | journal = Bahá'í News |date=December 1976 |page = 2 |url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=09&amp;page=406| issue = 505| issn=0195-9212}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a continued meeting in 1978 when a small group of Bahá'ís visited them for a week and encouraged them to adopt an extension goal of a nearby village.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = Botswana: Deepening institute held| journal = Bahá'í News |date=May 1979 |page = 14 |url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=09&amp;page=738| issue = 505| issn=0195-9212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482.

===Youth projects===
Among the earliest development projects in Botswana was a systematic initiation of a major "Youth Year of Service" project which coordinated volunteer activities with assemblies with a defined need.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = A look at programs around the world| journal = Bahá'í News |date=April 1988 |pages = 2–3|url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=12&amp;page=265| issue = 505| issn=0195-9212}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was extended by an orientation program of youth in diverse traditional African cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = Botswana | journal = Bahá'í News |date=December 1988 |page = 15|url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=12&amp;page=431| issue = 505| issn=0195-9212}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, recognition of the work of the national government in support of human rights was presented by the national assembly - at the reception ambassadors and diplomatic core from several countries and the UN. The UN representative invited the Baha'is in turn to co-sponso the 1988 UN Day observance. An international youth conference was held in 1989 at which 120 people from 13 countries attended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = Botswana| journal = Bahá'í News |date=February 1990 |page = 14|url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=12&amp;page=693| issue = 706| issn=0195-9212}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December youth from [[Transkei]] were among the choirs that performed at a Bahá'í International Music Festival in Botswana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = A Bahá'í choir from... | journal = Bahá'í News |date=March 1990 |page = 16|url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=12&amp;page=714| issue = 706| issn=0195-9212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1994-95, youth camps were particularly popular in Botswana where the community held the country's first youth camp. For one week, youth gathered at the Bahá'í Institute in [[Mahalapye]] and studied the life of [[Bahá'u'lláh]], the [[Kitab-i-Aqdas]], and such teachings of the religion as [[Bahá'í marriage|chastity and marriage]], and the [[Bahá'í Faith on life after death|immortality of the soul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

"'''Black Cross'''" (AKA "'''Hezekiah Jones'''", after the main character) is a poem by [[Joseph Simon Newman]], published in his 1948 collection ''It Could Be Verse!''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Hezekiah was a poor black farmer, who worked his two acres of land; but, he also saved up for and read books. The white folks thereabouts thought him harmless enough, but that "reading ain't no good for an ignorant nigger". Reverend Green, of the white man's church, visited him and asked if he believed in the Lord, the church, and Heaven. Hezekiah replied, that he'd never seen the Lord; that the church was divided; and that he tried to be as good as he could without expecting anything from Heaven or the Lord.
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;"You don't believe nothin'," said the white man's preacher.
"Oh yes I do," said Hezekiah,
"I believe that a man should be beholding to his neighbor
Without the reward of Heaven or the fear of hell fire."

“Well, there's a lot of good ways for a man to be wicked!"
And they hung Hezekiah as high as a pigeon,
And the nice folks around said, "Well, he had it comin'
'Cause the son-of-a-bitch didn't have no religion!"&lt;ref name=LBC /&gt;&lt;/poem&gt; }}

The poem was a signature piece of the American stage performer [[Lord Buckley]]. A live performance, in which he speaks the words over a solo female voice singing and humming the [[spiritual (music)|spiritual]] "[[Kumbaya]]" and a sparse instrumental accompaniment, is included on his 1959 album ''Way Out Humor'',&lt;ref&gt;{{discogs release

Early in his career, [[Bob Dylan]] performed the poem, in slightly shortened form, as a spoken piece with guitar accompaniment in a style based on that of Lord Buckley. Two amateur recordings exist: on one of the [[Bob Dylan bootleg recordings#The Minnesota Hotel Tapes|Minnesota Hotel Tapes]], December 1961, and on the [[Bob Dylan bootleg recordings#The Gaslight Caf.C3.A9 Recordings|Second Gaslight Tape]], October 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

{{Buddhism}}
{{Anti-consumerism |Theories}}
'''Buddhist economics''' is a spiritual and philosophical approach to the study of [[economics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grossnationalhappiness.com/articlesongnh/ArticlesonGNHinPDF/Gnh&amp;dev-10.pdf Gross National Happiness » Maintenance Mode&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902183449/http://www.grossnationalhappiness.com/articlesongnh/ArticlesonGNHinPDF/Gnh%26dev-10.pdf |date=September 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It examines the psychology of the human mind and the emotions that direct economic activity, in particular concepts such as anxiety, aspirations and [[self-actualization]] principles. In the view of its proponents, Buddhist economics aims to clear the confusion about what is harmful and what is beneficial in the range of human activities involving the production and consumption of goods and services, ultimately trying to make human beings ethically mature.&lt;ref name=KSL /&gt; The ideology's stated purpose is to "find a [[middle way]] between a purely mundane society and an immobile, conventional society."&lt;ref name=EFS /&gt;

Sri Lankan economist [[Neville Karunatilake]] wrote that: "A Buddhist economic system has its foundations in the development of a co-operative and harmonious effort in group living. Selfishness and acquisitive pursuits have to be eliminated by developing man himself."&lt;ref&gt;Karunatilake, ''This Confused Society'' (1976)&lt;/ref&gt; Karunatilake sees Buddhist economic principles as exemplified in the rule of the Buddhist king [[Ashoka]].

[[Bhutan]]'s King [[Jigme Singye Wangchuck]] and its government have promoted the concept of "[[gross national happiness]]" (GNH) since 1972, based on Buddhist spiritual values, as a counter to gauging a nation's development by [[gross domestic product]] (GDP). This represents a commitment to building an economy that would serve Bhutan's culture based on [[Buddhist]] spiritual values instead of material development, such as being gauged by only GDP.&lt;ref name="policyinnovations.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.policyinnovations.org/ideas/briefings/data/000098/:pf_printable|title=Policy Innovations - Redefining Progress|work=policyinnovations.org|accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. economics professor [[Clair Brown]] sets up a Buddhist economics framework that integrates [[Amartya Sen]]'s capability approach with shared prosperity and sustainability. In her Buddhist economics model, valuation of economic performance is based on how well the economy delivers a high quality of life to everyone while it protects the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sen|first1=Amartya|title=Development as Freedom|date=1999|publisher=Knopf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to domestic output (or consumption), measuring economic performance includes equity, sustainability, and activities that create a meaningful life. A person’s well-being depends on cultivation of inner (spiritual) wealth even more than outer (material) wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kadampa.org/temples/the-symbolism-of-the-traditional-temple|title=The Symbolism of the Traditional Temple}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buddhist economics holds that truly rational decisions can only be made when we understand what creates irrationality. When people understand what constitutes desire, they realize that all the wealth in the world cannot satisfy it. When people understand the universality of fear, they become more compassionate to all beings. Thus, this spiritual approach to economics doesn't rely on theories and models, but on the essential forces of acumen, empathy, and restraint.&lt;ref name=KSL /&gt; From the perspective of a Buddhist, economics and other streams of knowledge cannot be separated. Economics is a single component of a combined effort to fix the problems of humanity and Buddhist economics works with it to reach a common goal of societal, individual, and environmental sufficiency.&lt;ref name=KSL /&gt;

==History==
[[Buddhist ethics]] was first applied to the running of a state's economy during the rule of the Indian Buddhist emperor [[Ashoka]] (c. 268 to 232 BCE). The reign of Ashoka is famous for an extensive [[philanthropic]] and public works program, which built hospitals, hostels, parks, and nature preserves.

The term "Buddhist economics" was coined by [[E. F. Schumacher]] in 1955, when he travelled to [[Burma]] as an [[Economist|economic consultant]] for Prime Minister [[U Nu]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwisdom.com/public/authors/EF-Schumacher.aspx#Anchor_Biography E. F. Schumacher: Life and Work&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111012162520/http://www.worldwisdom.com/public/authors/EF-Schumacher.aspx#Anchor_Biography |date=October 12, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was used in his essay named "Buddhist Economics", which was first published in 1966 in ''Asia: A Handbook'', and republished in his influential collection ''[[Small Is Beautiful]]'' (1973). The term is currently used by followers of Schumacher and by [[Theravada Buddhist]] writers, such as [[Prayudh Payutto]], Padmasiri De Silva, and [[Luang Por Dattajivo]].

The 1st Conference of the Buddhist Economics Research Platform was held in Budapest, Hungary from 23–24 August 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120709152623/http://ethics.bkae.hu/html/buddhist_conferences.htm Buddhist Economics - Conferences&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The second conference was held at Ubon Ratchathani University, Thailand from 9–11 April 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://buddhist-economics.info/index.html Buddhist Economics Research Platform&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==General views on economics==
Unlike traditional economics, Buddhist economics considers stages after the consumption of a product, investigating how trends affect the three intertwined aspects of human existence: the individual, society, and the environment. For example, if there were an increase in the consumption of cigarettes, Buddhist economists try to decipher how this increase affects the pollution levels in the environment, its impact on passive smokers and active smokers, and the various health hazards that come along with smoking, thus taking into consideration the ethical side of economics. The ethical aspect of it is partly judged by the outcomes it brings and partly by the qualities that lead to it.&lt;ref name=KSL /&gt;

The Buddhist point of view ascribes to work three functions: to give man a chance to utilize and develop his aptitude; to enable him to overcome his self-aggrandizement by engaging with other people in common tasks; and to bring forward the goods and services needed for a better existence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldtrans.org/whole/buddecon.html Buddhist Economics&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Differences between traditional and Buddhist economics ==
There are a number of differences between traditional economics and Buddhist economics.
 
* While traditional economics concentrates on self-interest, the Buddhist view challenges it by changing the concept of self to [[Anatta]] or no-self. It posits that all things perceived by one's senses are not actually "I" or "mine" and therefore, humans must detach themselves from this feeling. Buddhist Economists believe that the self-interest based, opportunistic approach to ethics will always fail. According to Buddhist Economists, generosity is a viable economic model of mutual reciprocity, because human beings are [[Homo reciprocans|homines reciprocantes]] who tend to reciprocate to feelings (either positively or negatively) by giving back more than what is given to them.&lt;ref name=LZN /&gt;
* Traditional economists emphasize importance to maximizing profits and individual gains, while the underlying principle of Buddhist economics is to minimize suffering (losses) for all living or non-living things. Studies conducted by Buddhist economists correlates that human beings show greater sensitivity to loss than to gains, and concluded that people should concentrate more on reducing the former.&lt;ref name=LZN /&gt;
* There is a difference with respect to the concept of desire. Traditional economics encourages material wealth and [[Taṇhā|desire]] in which people attempt to accumulate more wealth to satisfy those cravings.  In contrast, in Buddhist economics, importance is given to simplify one's desires.  According to Buddhist economists, apart from the basic necessities like food, shelter, clothing, and medicines, other materialistic needs should be minimized. Buddhist economists say that overall well-being decreases if people pursue meaningless desires; wanting less will benefit the person, the community they live in, and nature overall.&lt;ref name=LZN /&gt;
* Views on the market are also different.  While many economists advocate maximizing markets to a point of saturation, Buddhist economists aim at minimizing violence.  Traditional economics do not take into consideration "primordial stakeholders", like future generations and the natural world because their vote is not considered relevant in terms of purchasing power.  They think that other stakeholders such as poor and marginalized people are under-represented because of their inadequate purchasing power and preference is given to the strongest stakeholder.  Therefore, they believe that the [[Market (economics)|market]] is not an unbiased place, but truly representative of the economy.  Thus, Buddhist economists advocate ''[[ahimsa]]'' or non-violence.  Ahimsa prevents doing anything that directly causes suffering to oneself or others and urges to find solutions in a participatory way. [[Community supported agriculture]] is one such example of community-based economic activities.  Buddhist economists believe that community-supported agriculture fosters trust, helps build value based communities and brings people closer to the land and their food source.  Achieving this sustainability and non-violence requires restructuring of dominating configurations of modern business, which they advocate. This leads to de-emphasizing [[profit maximization]] as the ultimate motive and renewed emphasis on introducing small-scale, locally adaptable, substantive economic activities.&lt;ref name=LZN /&gt;
* Traditional economists try to maximize ''instrumental use'' where the value of any entity is determined by its marginal contribution to the production output while Buddhist economists feel that the real value of an entity is neither realized nor given importance to.  Buddhist economists attempt to reduce instrumental use and form caring organizations that will be rewarded in terms of trust among the management, co-workers, and employees.&lt;ref name=LZN /&gt;
* Traditional economists tend to believe that bigger is better and more is more, whereas Buddhist economists believe that small is beautiful and less is more.&lt;ref name=LZN /&gt;
* Traditional economics gives importance to [[gross national product]] whereas Buddhist economics gives importance to [[gross national happiness]].&lt;ref&gt;stephensp.net16.net/articles/grossnatl%20happylongbuddhist.doc&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other beliefs==
Buddhist economists believe that as long as work is considered a disutility for laborers and laborers a necessary evil for employers, the true potential of the laborers and employers cannot be achieved. In such a situation, employees will always prefer income without employment and employers will always prefer output without employees. They feel that if the nature of work is truly appreciated and applied, it will be as important to the brain as food is to the body. It will nourish man and motivate him to do his best. According to them, goods should not be considered more important than people and consumption more important than creative activity. They feel that as a result of this, the focus shifts from the worker to the product of the work, the human to the [[wikt:subhuman|subhuman]], which is wrong.&lt;ref name=EFS /&gt;

According to them, people are unable to feel liberated not because of wealth but because of their attachment to wealth. In the same way, they say that it is the craving for pleasurable baubles and not the enjoyment from them that holds humans back.&lt;ref name=EFS /&gt;

Buddhist economists do not believe in measuring [[standard of living]] by the amount of consumption because according to them, obtaining maximum well being as a result of minimum consumption is more important than obtaining maximum well being from maximum consumption. Thus, they feel that the concept of being "better off" because of greater levels of consumption is not a true measure of happiness.&lt;ref name=EFS /&gt;

From the point of view of a Buddhist economist, the most rational way of economic life is being self-sufficient and producing local resources for local needs and depending on imports and exports is uneconomic and justifiable only in a few cases and on a small scale. Thus, they believe in economic development, independent of foreign aid.&lt;ref name=EFS /&gt;

Buddhist economics also gives importance to natural, renewable, and [[non-renewable resources]]. They feel that non-renewable resources should only be used when most needed and then also with utmost care, meticulously planning out its use. They believe that using them extravagantly is violent and not in keeping with the Buddhist belief of nonviolence. According to them, if the entire population relies on non-renewable resources for their existence, they are behaving parasitically, preying on capital goods instead of income. Adding to this, they feel that this uneven distribution and ever increasing exploitation of natural resources will lead to violence between man.&lt;ref name=EFS /&gt;

They also believe that satisfaction need not necessarily be felt only when something tangible is got back in return for giving something or something material is gained, as stated in modern economics. They say that the feeling of satisfaction can be achieved even when one parts with something without getting anything tangible in return. An example is when one gives presents to their loved ones simply because they want them to be happy.&lt;ref name=KSL /&gt;

Buddhist economists believe that production is a very misleading term. According to them, to produce something new, the old form has to be destroyed. Therefore, production and consumption become complementary to each other. Taking this into consideration, they advocate non-production in certain cases because when one produces less materialistic things, they reduce exploitation of the world's resources and lead the life of a responsible and aware citizen.&lt;ref name=KSL /&gt;

==The middle way of living==
The concept of the "middle way" says that time should be divided between working towards consumption and meditation and the optimal allocation between these two activities will be when some meditation is utilized to lower the desire for consumption and to be satisfied with lesser consumption and the work that it involves.&lt;ref name=LZN /&gt; In economic terms this means "the marginal productivity of labor utilized in producing consumption goods is equal to the marginal effectiveness of the meditation involved in economizing on consumption without bringing about any change in satisfaction".&lt;ref name=LZN /&gt;

The '''''Carmen Saliare''''' is a fragment of [[Old Latin|archaic Latin]], which played a part in the [[ritual]]s performed by the [[Salii]] (Salian [[priest]]s, a.k.a. "leaping priests") of [[Ancient Rome]].&lt;ref name="AndoRüpke2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Clifford Ando|author2=Jörg Rüpke|title=Religion and Law in Classical and Christian Rome|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uZ5JP8gZgJEC&amp;pg=PA18|year=2006|publisher=Franz Steiner Verlag|isbn=978-3-515-08854-1|pages=18–}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 35 extant fragments of the ''Carmen Saliare'', which can be read in Morel's ''FPL''.&lt;ref&gt;''FPL''=''Fragmenta poetarum latinorum epicorum et lyricorum: praeter enni annales et Ciceronis Germanicique Aratea'', originally compiled by W. Morel 1927, 2nd edition by C. Büchner 1982, 3rd and 4th editions by J. Blänsdorf in 1995 and 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rituals revolved around [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] and [[Quirinus]], and were performed in March and October.  These involved processions in which they donned archaic [[armour]] and weapons, performed their sacred [[dance]], and sang the ''Carmen Saliare''.  As a body they existed before the founding of the [[Roman Republic]], tracing their origin back to the reign of [[Numa Pompilius]].  The Salian priests were chosen from the sons of [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician families]] whose parents were still living. They were appointed for life, though they were allowed to resign from the Salian priesthood if they achieved a more prestigious priesthood or a major magistracy.

In the [[Annals (Tacitus)|Annales]] written by Roman historian [[Tacitus]], it is revealed that several Romans proposed the name of [[Germanicus]] to be added to the Salian Song, as a memory of his virtue and goodwill.

The mysterious ''cozeulodorieso'' has attracted several proposals. [[Julius Pomponius Laetus]] proposed in his [[editio princeps]] the interpretation ''osculo dolori ero'' "I shall be as a kiss to grief", though his emendations are now dismissed as "editorial fantasy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Giulia|last=Sarullo|first2=Daniel J.|last2=Taylor|title=Two Fragments of the Carmen Saliare and the Manuscript Tradition of Varro’s De Lingua Latina|url=https://www.academia.edu/5963985/Two_Fragments_of_the_Carmen_Saliare_and_the_Manuscript_Tradition_of_Varro_s_De_Lingua_Latina|date=December 2013|journal=Codices Manuscripti &amp; Impressi|volume=91/92|pages=1–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[George Hempl]] restored it more carefully to ''coceulod orieso'', attested in some manuscripts aside from the spacing, which is good archaic Latin for classical ''cucūlō oriēre'' "(thou shalt) come forth with the [[cuckoo]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hempl|first=George|date=1899|title=The Origin of the Latin Letters G and Z|journal=Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association|volume=30|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|pages=24–41|doi=10.2307/282560|jstor=282560}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of Gujarat}}

The '''Chudasama dynasty''' ruled parts of the present-day [[Saurashtra region]] of [[Gujarat]] state in India between 9th and 15th centuries. Their capital was based in [[Junagadh]] and [[Vanthali|Vamanasthali]], and they were later classified among the [[Rajput]] clans.

The early history of Chudasama dynasty is almost lost. The bardic legends differs very much in names, order and numbers so they are not considered reliable. Traditionally, the dynasty is said to have been founded in the late 9th century by [[Chudachandra]]. Subsequent rulers such as [[Graharipu]], [[Navaghana (late 11th century king)|Navaghana]] and [[Khengara (12th century king)|Khengara]] were in conflict with [[Chaulukya]] rulers [[Mularaja]] and [[Jayasimha Siddharaja]]. Thus they are mentioned in contemporary and later Jain chronicles. After end of the rule of Chaulukya and their successor [[Vaghela dynasty]] in Gujarat, the Chudasamas continued to rule independently or as a vassal of successor states, [[Gujarat under Delhi Sultanate|Delhi Sultanate]] and [[Gujarat Sultanate]]. [[Mandalika I]] was the first known ruler from inscriptions during whose reign Gujarat was invaded by [[Khalji dynasty]] of Delhi. The last king of the dynasty, [[Mandalika III]], was defeated and forcibly converted to Islam in 1472 by Gujarat Sultan [[Mahmud Begada]], who also annexed the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge Shorter History of India |chapter=Gujarat, Malwa and Khandesh |first= |last= |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |year=1934 |pages=307–308 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9_48AAAAIAAJ |accessdate=2012-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Studies In Indian History: Rajasthan Through The Ages: Marwar and British Administration |editor1-first=R.

==Titles==
''Ra'', ''Rao'', ''Raval'', ''Raul'' were the titles adopted by the rulers of Chudasama dynasty which are found in their inscriptions, manuscripts and bardic literature.

The Chudasamas are sometimes referred to as the [[Abhira tribe|Abhira]] Ranaka or Ahir Ranas, and Tambs-Lyche says that, "The structure of the Chudasama state&amp;nbsp;... seems to have been an alliance between a small royal clan&amp;nbsp;— later to be classified as Rajputs&amp;nbsp;— and the [[Ahir]] tribe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Contemporary Society: Concept of Tribal Society |first=Harald Tambs|last=Lyche |chapter=Townsmen, Tenants and Tribes: War, Wildness and Wilderness in the Traditional Politics of Western India |editor1-first=S.

== Origin, genealogy and chronology==
{{main|Chronology of Chudasama dynasty}}

Archaeologist [[K. V. Soundararajan]] considers the Chudasama dynasty as originally of [[Abhira]] clan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= KV| first= Soundararajan |title=Junagadh|publisher = Archaeological Survey of India| page = 10 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=bPNEAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=abhira+chudasama&amp;dq=abhira+chudasama&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi0ud2_i9jaAhVN92MKHSfxAhUQ6AEIOjAE }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no inscriptions of the period before the king [[Mandalika I]] available. Still it is certain that they had established their rule in the Saurashtra region before the [[Chaulukya dynasty|Chaulukya]] king [[Mularaja]] came to power in [[Anahilavada]] because literary sources tell about battles between Chudasama kings and Chaulukya kings; Mularaja and [[Jayasimha Siddharaja]]. Dhandusar inscription (VS 1445) says that the founder of the dynasty was Chudachandra. A Vanthali inscription tells about Mandalika, a kings whose kingdom was captured by Jagatsimha, a feudatory of Chaulukya king Viradhavala. This Mandalika king must be another Mandalika king mentioned in latter half genealogy. As Viradhavala is known to live in VS 1288, he must be assigned the same date. As another Vanthali inscription date VS 1346, it must have been under the Jagatsimha's family till then. It seems that a later Chudasama king Mandalika regained Vanthali when Chaulukya rule weakened. So the later genealogy starts from him in later inscriptions. The Chudasamas continued to rule till VS 1527 (1472 CE) when they were defeated by [[Gujarat Sultanate|Gujarat Sultan]] [[Mahmud Begada]]. As inscriptions says about their resistance to Gujarat Sultans, it can be said that they were the most powerful dynasty in Saurashtra region at that time.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.54106|title=New Indian Antiquary|last=Diskalkar|first=D.

==Coins==
Based on historical records, it is known that the coins known as Kodis, Karshapan or Pan, Vishopak, Dram and Rupak were used in Chudasama domains. 80 Kodis were equal to one Karshapan and 16 Karshapan were equal to one Dram. One Dram was equal to 20 Vishopak.&lt;ref name="gog1975"&gt;{{cite book|title=Gazetteers: Junagadh|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KpBuAAAAMAAJ|year=1975|publisher=Directorate of Government Print., Stationery and Publications|page=467}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their copper coins had a humped bull ([[Nandi (bull)|Nandi]]) seated facing left on obverse and a Devanagari letter 'Sri' within dotted and line circle on reverse. They weighted around 2.18 g and were 14.38mm is diameter.&lt;!---some listed coins have peacock, lion, conch shell on their obverse.---&gt;{{cn|date=December 2017}}

==Constructions==
The [[Uparkot Fort]] of Junagadh was occupied by Chudasamas during the reign of [[Graharipu]]. Later it is said to have been rebuilt by [[Navaghana (late 11th century king)|Navaghana]] who had transferred his capital from Vamanasthali to Junagadh. He is also attributed with the constructions of Navghan Kuvo and Adi Kadi Vav, a well and a stepwell respectively, in the fort. His descendant [[Khengara (12th century king)|Khengara]] is attributed with a stepwell, Khengar Vav, on the way to Vanthali from Junagadh though it was built by Tejpal, the minister in the [[Vaghela dynasty|Vaghela]] court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jutta Jain-Neubauer|title=The Stepwells of Gujarat: In Art-historical Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=61fSwBF4bbYC|year=1981|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=978-0-391-02284-3|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conflict with Chaulukyas==
The Chudasama dynasty were in constant conflict with the [[Chaulukya]]s. [[Hemachandra]] states that [[Mularaja]] of the Chaulukya dynasty  fought against Abhira raja, [[Graharipu]] ruling at Junagadh to protect the pilgrims going to [[Prabhas Patan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ZZ8T8tZc4YC&amp;pg=PA108&amp;dq=graharipu+abhira&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwii8cygpovcAhXGGDQIHXQeDc8Q6AEILzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Graharipu&amp;f=false| title= Somanatha | publisher= Penguin Books | work= History | date= 2004 | author= Romila Thapar | pages=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21960">'''Classical Hindu law in practice''' originates from community, not a state polity. In this way, particular groups of society began to gain influence in the creation and administration of law. Primary corporate groups, Kingships, and Brahmins were the factions, which conveyed Hindu jurisprudence in practice. Corporate groups were responsible for legislating law through the conception of [[Norm (sociology)|social norms]];&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;Davis:''The Spirit of Hindu Law''&lt;/ref&gt; kingships were responsible for the administration of punishment and the worldly Hindu system; and Brahmins were responsible for ritual, penance, and the maintenance of a spiritual Hindu system.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Lingat: 1973&lt;/ref&gt;

==Administration of Classical Hindu Law==

===Corporate groups===
Corporate groups in medieval India included, but were not limited to, merchants, traders, religious specialists, soldiers, agriculturalists, pastoralists, and castes. These groups held legal prominence in classical Indian society because the primary authority and responsibility for law at the time came from the community, not a state polity.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; Particularly, early Dharmasūtra ([[dharmasutra]]) texts, beginning in about the 2nd BC, recognized a full-fledged theology surrounding the household institution.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;Davis&lt;/ref&gt; The texts viewed households and families as the archetype of community, "an exemplary institution of religious and legal reflection of Hindu jurisprudence".&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt; Thus, Hindu jurisprudence portrayed the household, not the state, as the primary institution of law.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt; Connectedly, the household is the institution to which Hindu law is most applied. For example, the texts are most explicit in reference to quotidian household acts such as eating, bathing, creating a family, etc. The focus on the household and other local institutions helped to identify the shared goals and goods within society which are inherent to Hindu law.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt; Furthermore, small-scale communities such as the household were more effective in imposing the acceptance of common values and core ideas.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt;

Because of the social implication revolving around the importance of the household and the community in the creation and administration of law, Hindu law jurisprudentially subordinated state law to the law of castes and life-stages ([[varna (Hinduism)|varna]]sramadharma).&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt; In this manner, each caste and life-stage was responsible for highly localized occupations. –

'''Table 1. Dharmas of the Castes, showing the subordinate place of political rulership'''&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;

I. Brahmin
:a. six occupations – teaching and studying the Veda, offering and officiating at sacrifices, giving and accepting gifts (MDh10.74-75)
II. Kṣatriya
:a. three occupations – studying the Veda, offering sacrifices, and giving gifts (MDh 10.77, 79)
:b. special dharmas = rājadharma, the dharma of a ruler (MDh 10.79-80)
::1. protection of the people (MDh 7.144; YS 1.323, 335)
::2. promulgation of the law of castes and life-stages (MDh 7.24, 35; 8.41, 390-91, 410-418; YS 1.361; NS 12.117, 18.5)
::3. punishment of the wicked (MDh 7.14-31; YS 1.338, 354-359)
::4. adjudication of disputes
III. Vaiśya
:a. three occupations – studying the Veda, offering sacrifices, and giving gifts (MDh 10.78-79)
:b. special dharmas (MDh 9.326-333; 10.79-80)
::1. trade
::2. animal husbandry
::3. agriculture
IV. Śūdra
:a. special dharma – "obedient service to distinguished Brahmin householders who are learned in the Veda" (MDh 9.334)

Although the household and family were central to corporate groups’ influence, medieval India was a time of political integration over larger and larger core areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/brill/sho/2005/00000048/00000001/art00003 Davis:2005]&lt;/ref&gt; During the time, corporate groups showed increased importance in the creation and administration of law. Such influence came with the development of corporate groups as intermediary tools. These intermediate-corporate groups exercised influence in two main ways:
# they moderate legal influences of both "highly local sources (villages, families, etc)" and "elite-level political rulers", which promotes pragmatic conflict resolution and the circulation of legal standards for specific groups, and
# they reconcile legal norms that influence local and regional customary law with esoteric Brahminical dialogue of [[Dharmaśāstra]] which establish "viable ideologies" that respect both customary and textual law.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Davis:2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Corporate groups also created their own laws and systems of jurisprudence. Specifically, the concept of [[ācāra]] in the Hindu legal texts (i.e. the Dharmaśāstra) legitimized these localized laws.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; Ācāra allowed localized corporate groups to create their own laws, especially in the situations where Hindu legal texts were vague, ambiguous, or completely silent.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt; In particular, ācāra of specific corporate groups plays out in practice as "norms accepted and imposed by the leaders of various social institutions".&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt; The key to the legitimization of these norms created and accepted by the leaders of corporate groups is the concept of the ‘good person’ in ācāra. This principal allows for the dissemination of sastric and Vedic control over practice through the mediation of experts who are learned in the texts. Through this, the Dharmaśāstra is connected to real life in a "mediate" way.&lt;ref&gt;Olivelle:2004, xl&lt;/ref&gt; Ācāra is also recognized and validated in a legal sense through the device of paribhāṣā, which deemed the conventional rules of ācāra as technical supplementary refinements of the rules of the śāstra.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

===Kingships===
{{main|Monarchy in Ancient India}}
The dharmasastras, starting with [[Manusmṛti|Manu]], first addressed the function of the king pertaining to the administration of Hindu law. These texts define the king as ‘he who has been anointed.’ Many scholars interpret anointment as the celebration of coronation rites, and thus believe that the ceremony is necessary to invest the king with supreme authority.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Although no rules lay down why or how a particular individual fits to qualify as king, Manu VII.2 indicates that only a Kṣatriya has the right to kingship. Some assume this is because the Kṣatriya possessed the force necessary to obtain obedience. However, interpreters of other dharmasastras, dispute this qualifying trait.&lt;ref&gt;yājñavalkya, vijñāneśvara&lt;/ref&gt;  The king was considered to have a divine nature, but not because of birth or immortality. Rather, the king encompassed god-likeness through exercising the royal function, which the texts say the gods created.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; This royal function is the source of the king's authority. The royal function vests the king with the power of command (kṣatra) and the mission to protect the people and give them the guarantee of security.&lt;ref&gt;yājñavalkya I.323&lt;/ref&gt; The sastras delineate the royal function to be the king's dharma (rājadharma). Aside from physical protection from the harmful in and outside of king's jurisdiction, rājadharma protects and permits his subjects’ dharma to flourish. In this way, the king's dharma encompasses all dharma since each individual's performance of his or her personal duties is dependent on the protection secured by the king.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Because of this interconnectedness between rājadharma and individual dharma (swadharma) "the salvation of the king depends on his subjects, just as the salvation of the subjects depend on the king".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The king's spiritual happiness depends on his subjects, for he suffers the consequences of their sins and profits from the merits they acquire. This relation applies vice versa as well.

====Punishment and justice====
The royal function gives two main privileges: the right to tax and the right to punish ([[daṇḍa]]), and they are benefits outlined solely for the king.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Only the king may use punishment to secure the execution of his orders. Due to his ability to punish, the king possesses an unlimited power on the temporal plane, and he may do whatever he wishes. [[Narada]] says, "whatever the king does is justified: such is the rule." Furthermore, the execution of punishment ensures justice within the king's jurisdiction, and thus the king is the sole judge of the means needed to accomplish his mission of justice. In this vein, he may act as he deems necessary for justice.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;  Moreover, exercising the royal function to maintain justice is equivalent to the celebration of a sacrifice, which keeps the king pure no matter what actions he must commit to bring a culprit to justice. However, although a king is always justified on a temporal plane, he would suffer the consequences of poor actions in his next lives.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Punishment falls under royal authority because it pertains to accomplishing true justice—a concept only the king can judge. Thus, where there is textual silence, kings are responsible for administrating trials ([[vyavahāra]]) of criminal law as well as administering punishment (daṇḍa) for criminal acts.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; King's judge trials other than criminal cases too, except when parties do not wish to appear before him. When parties do not wish to bring a complaint to the king, individuals and corporate groups conduct their own trials. In these cases, although corporate groups such as castes and vocational sects have their own jurisdiction (which came from customary origins) they are still in the king's control. The king exercises this control through the recognition of a corporate group's particular jurisprudence. Recognition is important because the king's court is the only jurisdiction Dharmasastras identifies, thus the king's acceptance of other courts transfers sastric meaning to the particular jurisdictions.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The king also employs danda when the Dharmasastra gives more than one penalty for a crime or when texts are contradictory. He is a source of last resort on questions of both fact and law, but once the king passes judgment it is not up for review.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

====Lawmaking====
Kings were not very active in legislating especially for the reason that Hindu legal texts always preceded the authority of the king.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; In this way, kings were limited in their ability to make laws on conduct because the [[Veda]] already outlined [[dharma]].  Judgments made by the king were never law, but considered orders. These orders did not change laws or give new interpretations to texts but merely secured order and peace to the king's jurisdiction. More reasonably, the king was an administrator rather than a legislator.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; As an administrator, the king maintained peace between his subjects rather than made laws. In addition, royal authority did allow the king to divide tasks of administration amongst ministers and to define the scope and the powers of each ministry.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Davis further attributes the lack of royal legislation or edict to the social context presumed by Hindu jurisprudence (i.e. the subordination of the state to the household). In this way, "the state is jurisprudentially part of the household dharma of the ruler" &lt;ref&gt;Davis: ''The Spirit of Hindu Law''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brahminical jurisprudence===

The [[Brahmin]] was an integral part of the administration of classical Hindu law. For [[Gautama]], the Brahmins and the king sustain the divine order of the world, the Brahmins with their council and the king by punishment.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; In this way, dharma cannot come to fruition without the two castes’ cooperation. The Brahmin's opinion is the only counterbalance to the king's authority in society, and because of this, the texts say that the king cannot make a decision without the advice of a Brahmin. For this reason, Brahmins have a right to participate in the court of justice. Additionally, when a king cannot preside over a case himself, a Brahmin must be appointed to take his place.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The Brahmin not only gives advice on the administration of justice but also in affairs of the state. "Brahmin is master when the question is one of ritual and of penance. But his scope extends in reality over all the field of royal activity, as much on its political side as on its religious".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The superiority of the Brahmin is not attached to their birth ([[varna (Hinduism)|varna]]) but to the fact that they are devoted to the study of the Veda, and thus are qualified to instruct other people. Because of this devotion to the Veda, the Brahmin is more closely in line with the divine than the king. Thus, Gautama says, the king is the master of all with the exception of the Brahmin. Such high ranking in the classical Hindu law system is apparent in that Brahmin's are exempt from taxes, and may own land (something that is reserved for only kings and Brahmins).&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Judicial practices of Classical Hindu Law==

There are no references of Judicial procedure in early Vedic times but there was a frequent mention of the term [[Rta]] implying that there was a divine cosmic order by which the universe was regulated. The idea of [[Dharma]] seems to have developed from Rta, since Dharma later became the word commonly used in ancient India to designate law. The Rig Veda provides little evidence of civil law. In ancient India Dharma had a religious basis and was enforced by religious threat. It changed not by the will of the king but the evolution of social custom usages and practices.&lt;ref&gt;Das: 1977. 93-127.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Brahmana period, the process of giving punishments to culprits was formed and for this reason law-assistants were appointed. The full Judicial procedure came into light during the composition of the [[Dharmaśāstras]] and Smrtis. King figures appeared as the highest judicial authority with a network of courts established under him.
The courts consisted of ten members King, Pravivaka, the Sabhyas, the Ganika (accountant), the Lekhaka (Clerk) and court inspector.

* '''Kings''' at the center of the court, facing the east- Sabhyas and Pradvivka on his right facing the north side, bench clerk on the left accountant opposite the bench clerk facing west. The King acted as the supreme judge and had the final decision issued under his signature and seal.
* '''Pradvivakas and Sabhyas-''' assist the king in arriving at the truth and giving correct judgment.
* '''Sabhyas''' seven, five or three in number—selected for their knowledge of the law and they had to advise the king on laws applicable to the case. Including only the people well versed in the Vedic lore and civil law.
* '''Bench clerk''' wrote down the pleading made orally in the case.
* '''Accountant''' made calculation of money involved in the suits.
* '''Sadhyapala''' preserved the order in the court, execute its decrees and see to the attendance of parties and witnesses.

The decision of a case in ancient India was based on eight sources according to brahmanical law givers. These sources are the three Pramanas (possession, documents, and witnesses) logical inference, the usages of the country, sapathas (oaths and ordeals), the kings edict and admission of the litigants.&lt;ref&gt;Kaul:1993. 136-37.&lt;/ref&gt; If there were cases where no possessions, documents and recourse can be provided the decision of the King became the ultimate authority.

Four parts of a trial—

* Pratijna - plaint or complaint
* Uttaram — answer of written statement
* Kriya — Trial
* Nirnaya — Decision according to [[Yajnavalkya Smriti|Yajnavalkya]]

===Ordeals===
Ordeals also referred to as Divya were divine methods of proof. They decided what cannot be or is not to be decided by human means of proof. The general rule stated by Yājñavalkya, [[Nāradasmṛti|Narada]], Brahaspati, Katyayana is that ordeals are to be retorted to only if there is no human evidence or circumstantial evidence available.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Kaul:1993. 149-155.&lt;/ref&gt; Different kinds of ordeals are mentioned at different places, [[Manusmṛti|Manu]] gives only two ordeals i.e. holding of fire and plunging in water. Yet Yājñavalkya and Vishnu give a list of five, namely balance, fire, water, poison, consecrate water. [[Nāradasmṛti|Narada]] gives seven different types of ordeals, i.e. ordeal by balance, fire, water, poison, libration, rice, hot piece of gold.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; Though there has been evidence found that shows the practice of only two ordeals i.e. ordeal by rice and ordeal by sacred libation. They show up in the sources from ancient Kashmir. In the final decisions by the King human modes of proof ruled over divine modes of proof. Ordeals were only used in extraordinary circumstances. There are also more restrictions on who can perform what type of ordeal. Ordeals were generally performed in the presence of King, the judge, learned Brahmans and the public. The place and time where the ordeals could be performed also held importance. They were usually administered either at dawn or in the forenoon or sometimes even late at night. Sunday was the preferred day to administer them. They usually took place at places like temple, royal gate, public place where four roads meet and the hall of justice. The chief judge by the order of the King had to conduct all the rites like a sacrificial priest. The chief judge and the Sodhya had to take religious dips, observe a fast and convoke all deities.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

Four major ordeals

* '''Ordeal of balance''' (Tula, Dhata)—mostly given to women, minors and old or disabled people. The person performing the ordeal was twice weighed on a balance. If the person weighed lighter than the previous weight they were considered innocent; if they were heavier the second time they were considered guilty.
* '''Ordeal of fire''' (Agni)—A hot ball of iron had to be carried across a certain distance in the palm of the hand using pipul leaves. If the hand did not end up getting burnt the person was declared innocent. If the hand was burnt the person was found guilty.
* '''Ordeal of water''' (Salila)—The person had to dive into a river and keep themselves under water, while at the same time an arrow was also shot into the water and was brought back by a fleet runner. If the person stayed under water till that time and no body part was visible then the person was considered innocent.  If the person floated back up again before the arrow was retrieved or a body part other than the top of the head became visible the person was found guilty.
* '''Ordeal of Poison''' (Visa)—the person had to take a certain quantity of poison and was monitored for any reactions for a certain time period. If there was no visible effect of the poison the person was considered innocent.

Other types of ordeals included ordeals mentioned in the Smrtis like the ordeal of sacred libation in which an image of a deity was washed in holy water and the accused had to drink that water. If within a certain time period a misfortune occurred in his life he was found to be guilty. Ordeal of rice grains, ordeal of heated piece of gold, ordeal by ploughshare, ordeal by lot also existed within various texts. Ordeals played a significant part in the judicial administration of ancient India, even though they were not really rational and couldn’t really detect guilt. As pointed out in Medhatithi ordeals were like magic and were meant to scare the guilty party and come out with the truth.

===Oaths===
Oaths are an affirmation of truth which can be liable to punishment for perjury if the statement given turns out to be false.
Manu recommended that when human proofs failed Sapatha or oath could be applied in search of the truth.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Das:1977. 93-127.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Smrti oaths were intended to be used in simple cases, while ordeals were used only in serious cases. A person making an oath was to swear on his near and dear ones. He might touch the head or feet of a Brahman or his wife or his son, or the feet of an image of a deity or take sacred grass or sesamum, silver, gold, earth, fire, water according as the value of the disputed property.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; The waiting period on the oaths was one, three, five or more days depending on the nature of the accusation. There is a great amount of sanctity attached to Oaths as explained in Manu that if a man swears on an oath falsely even in a small matter will be lost in this world as well as the next.

'''Daily devotionals''' are publications which provide a specific spiritual reading for each calendar day. Popular daily devotional booklets include ''[[The_Upper_Room_(Devotional_and_Ministry_Organization)|The Upper Room]]'', ''[[Our Daily Bread]]'', ''[[Portals of Prayer]]'',  and ''[[The Word Among Us]]''. 

[[Lutheran Hour Ministries]] makes daily devotions specifically for the [[liturgical season]]s of [[Advent]] and [[Lent]], in addition to other parts of the Church Year.&lt;ref name="Lippy2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lippy|first=Charles H.|title=American Religious Culture in the Twentieth Century|date=5 July 2000|publisher=M.E.

Daily devotionals have a long tradition in religious communities, with the earliest known [[Christian]] example being the [[Old Irish|Gælic]] ''Feliré'' written in [[Ireland]] in the Ninth Century.&lt;ref name="Hudson-176"&gt;Hudson, Robert (ed.)

Daily devotionals, while common among Christians, can be found in many other traditions as well.  Classic examples of devotionals include [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s ''The Reading Circle''.&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy, Lev N. (1908) ''Круг чтения: избранныя мысли многих писателей об истинѣ, жизни и поведении'' (''Krug Chteniia'', ''The Reading Circle'')  A compendium of edifying readings for each day of the year, culled by Lev Tolstoy from the writings of various cultures; published in English as: Tolstoy, Lev (1997)''A calendar of wisdom: daily thoughts to nourish the soul'' (translated by Peter Sekirin) Scribner, New York, {{ISBN|0-684-83793-5}}; mentioned as a classic in [[Leonid Dobychin|Dobychin, Leonid]]; Borden, Richard C. and Belova, Natalia (2005) ''Encounters with Lise and Other Stories'' Northwestern University Press, Evanston, Illinois, p. 155, {{ISBN|0-8101-1972-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, Oswald (1927) ''My utmost for His Highest; selections for every day'' F.A.

Traditionally daily devotionals came in the format of a book, with one reading passage for each day.  With the advent of online content, daily devotionals come in multiple formats including blogs, websites, and emails.  There continues to be a multitude of devotional books and calendars, in addition to numerous online devotionals, that are tailored to a variety of recipient, denomination, or view.

The founder of the dynasty, [[Gulab Singh]], was an influential noble in the court of the [[Ranjit Singh|Maharaja Ranjit Singh]] of [[Sikh Empire|Lahore]].  Appointed by Ranjit Singh as the hereditary Raja of the [[Jammu]] principality, he established his supremacy over all the hill states surrounding the [[Kashmir Valley]]. After the [[First Anglo-Sikh War]] in 1846, under the terms of the [[Treaty of Amritsar, 1846]], the British Indian government acquired Kashmir from the Sikh Empire and transferred it to Gulab Singh, recognising him as an independent Maharaja.

The last ruling [[Maharaja]] of Jammu and Kashmir was [[Hari Singh]], who contributed troops to the British war effort in [[World War II]] and served on [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]]'s Imperial War Cabinet.{{sfn|Schofield, Kashmir in Conflict|2003|p=22}} Following the [[Partition of India]] in 1947, Hari Singh faced a rebellion in the western districts of the state and a Pakistan-supported [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947|tribal invasion]], leading him to [[Instrument of Accession (Jammu and Kashmir)|accede]] to the [[Union of India]] and receive military assistance. Pakistan contested the accession, giving rise to the enduring [[Kashmir conflict]].

With India's support, the popular leader of Jammu and Kashmir, [[Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah]], forced the Maharaja to abdicate in favour of his son, ''Yuvraj'' (Crown Prince) [[Karan Singh]], who subsequently accepted the position of a constitutional head of state (''Sadr-i-Riyasat'') and voluntarily gave up the title of ''Maharaja''.&lt;ref name="Lyon2008"&gt;{{citation |last=Lyon |first=Peter |title=Conflict Between India and Pakistan: An Encyclopedia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vLwOck15eboC&amp;pg=PA150 |year=2008 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-57607-712-2 |pages=150–151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term [[Dogra]] is thought to derive from ''Durgara'', the name of a kingdom mentioned in an eleventh century copper-plate inscription in [[Chamba State|Chamba]]. In medieval times the term became ''Dugar'', which later turned into Dogra. Kalhana's ''[[Rajatarangini]]'' makes no mention of a kingdom by this name, but it could have been referred to by its capital (ether ''Vallapura'', modern Balor, or ''Babbapura'', modern Babor). In modern times, the term Dogra turned into an ethnic identity, claimed by all those people that speak the [[Dogri language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Hāṇḍā |first=Omacanda |title=Textiles, Costumes, and Ornaments of the Western Himalaya |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JFPnh9B5zncC&amp;pg=PA178 |year=1998 |publisher=Indus Publishing |isbn=978-81-7387-076-7 |pages=178–179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The family of Raja Gulab Singh is referred to as [[Jamwal]] (or ''Jamuwal''). According to some accounts, Raja Kapur Dev, who ruled the area of Jammu around 1560 AD had two sons named Jag Dev and Samail Dev. The two sons ruled from the [[Bahu Fort|Bahu]] and [[Jammu]] on the opposite banks of the [[Tawi River]] and their descendants came to be called ''Bahuwals'' and ''Jamuwals'' respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Charak |first=Sukh Dev Singh |title=Maharaja Ranjitdev and the Rise and Fall of Jammu Kingdom, from 1700 A.D. to 1820 A.D. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y7U5AQAAIAAJ |year=1971 |publisher=Dogra-Pahari Itihas Kendra |p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; The members of the family however claim descent from a legendary [[Suryavansha|Suryavanshi]] (solar) dynasty ruler [[Jambu Lochan]], who is believed to have founded the city of Jammu in antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Sufi |first=G.

==History of Jamwal rulers==
{{expand section|date=January 2017}}
[[Raja]] Dhruv Dev laid down the foundations of the Jamwal rulers of Jammu in 1703.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=f-1XyQ2eIG8C&amp;pg=PA60&amp;lpg=PA60&amp;dq=raja+dhruv+dev+mughal&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8nIEU50Wky&amp;sig=YH86k25BKdNHfwwjM1SPb-gWcNo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjjguiWu8LRAhXLCiwKHbBJBKUQ6AEIQjAG#v=onepage&amp;q=raja%20dhruv%20dev%20mughal&amp;f=false|title=Paintings and Lifestyles of Jammu Region: From 17th to 19th Century A.D.|last=Kumar|first=Raj|date=2006|publisher=Gyan Publishing House|year=|isbn=9788178355771|location=|page=60|pages=|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His son Raja Ranjit Dev (1728–1780), introduced social reforms such as a ban on [[Sati (practice)|sati]] (immolation of the wife on the pyre of the husband) and female infanticide.

Raja Ranjit Dev was succeed by Raja Braj Dev who killed his brother and nephew to become king.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Braj Dev was killed during the Sikh invasion of Jammu in 1787. His infant son Raja Sampuran Singh (1787–1797) succeeded with Jammu becoming an autonomous tributary under the Sikh empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Kugq3wEh-W4C&amp;pg=PA29&amp;lpg=PA29&amp;dq=Raja+jit+Singh+jammu+sikh&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=aN4va6S7cV&amp;sig=18_EQLjoLXPzaTsDp52A_moCZkk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjxuOeLx8LRAhVEWxoKHYLeBT44ChDoAQg9MAs#v=onepage&amp;q=Raja%20jit%20Singh%20jammu%20sikh&amp;f=false|title=Pahāṛi Styles of Indian Murals|last=Charak|first=Sukh Dev Singh|last2=Billawaria|first2=Anita K.|date=1998|publisher=Abhinav Publications|year=|isbn=9788170173564|location=|pages=29|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sampuran Singh with no issue, was succeeded by his uncle Raja Jit Singh.

Jit Singh was involved in another conflict with the Sikh empire, which he lost and was exiled into British territory. With Jammu fully annexed by the Sikhs around 1808, Ranjit Singh first allotted it to his son [[Kharak Singh]]. However, Kharak Singh's agents were unable to maintain law and order, with locals led by Mian Dedo rebelling against the Sikh ''jagirdar'' (governor).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OzZzFm4pLWQC&amp;pg=PA183&amp;lpg=PA183&amp;dq=kishore+singh+jammu+gulab+singh&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-zxRWhFy9w&amp;sig=sLa1A2oq-jHP_k0bWEnpkUclom0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjxnoXnzcLRAhWMWCwKHeqSC6c4ChDoAQhMMA4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Advance Study in the History of Modern India (Volume-2: 1803-1920)|last=Chhabra|first=G.

==Gulab Singh==

[[File:Gulabsingh1840.jpg|thumb|right|x250px|text|[[Gulab Singh of Jammu and Kashmir|Maharaja Gulab Singh]], the founder of princely state of Jammu and Kashmir]]

Around 1808, Jammu became part of the [[Sikh Empire]], under [[Ranjit Singh|Maharaja Ranjit Singh]]. Ranjit Singh in 1820, bestowed the place as a jagir on Gulab Singh's father Kishore Singh, who belonged to the Jamwal Rajput clan that ruled Jammu. As a ''jagirdar'' (governor) for the Sikhs, Gulab Singh extended the boundaries of the Sikh Empire to western Tibet with the help of his fine General [[Zorawar Singh Kahluria|Zorawar Singh]]. The Sikh rule was then extended beyond the Jammu Region and the Kashmir Valley to include the Tibetan Buddhist Kingdom of Ladakh and the Emirates of [[State of Hunza|Hunza]], [[Gilgit Agency|Gilgit]] and [[State of Nagar|Nagar]].

In the turmoil for succession of the Sikh empire that followed Maharaja Ranjit Singh's death in 1839, two of Gulab Singh's sons Udham Singh, and Sohan Singh were killed in the feuding between the Sikh heirs. His youngest brother Suchet Singh, was killed by his own nephew Hira Singh, the ''Vizir'' (prime minister) of the Sikh empire. Hira Singh, was a great favourite of Maharaja Ranjit Singh&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a19eCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT70&amp;lpg=PT70&amp;dq=Hira+Singh+emperor+sikh+ranjit+singh&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=P1TRVf2i4z&amp;sig=E4lX0Ni_bMGIJIpYqM-ZoDuR_zM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjry9CS8sPRAhWHDBoKHaZpCKs4FBDoAQgZMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Hira%20Singh%20emperor%20sikh%20ranjit%20singh&amp;f=false|title=Understanding Kashmir and Kashmiris|last=Snedden|first=Christopher|date=2015-09-15|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9781849046220|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Gulab Singh once even aspired to have him installed as the Sikh emperor.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Hira Singh had become prime minister aged 24, after his father and Gulab Singh's brother ''Vizir'' Dhian Singh was assassinated in his blotched September 1843 coup d'état against Sikh emperor [[Sher Singh]] in Lahore. During the regency of Maharani [[Jind Kaur]], Hira Singh was killed by the Sikh army in December 1844.

Gulab Singh, came into possession of the [[Koh-i-Noor|Koh-i-noor]] diamond, after Maharaja [[Kharak Singh]]'s mysterious death in prison in 1840, and had previously presented the famous stone to Maharaja Sher Singh to win his favour.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7dymBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT121&amp;lpg=PT121&amp;dq=dhian+singh+dogra+prime+minister+ranjit+singh&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xFupP_xisL&amp;sig=L-tw1IxibIvd8_Izolo4vtZpqZE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjY4cjj58PRAhUJ2hoKHU-jC0AQ6AEIQjAG#v=onepage&amp;q=dhian%20singh%20dogra%20prime%20minister%20ranjit%20singh&amp;f=false|title=The Koh-i-noor Diamond|last=Amini|first=Iradj|date=2013-06-01|publisher=Roli Books Private Limited|isbn=9789351940357|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[First Anglo-Sikh War]] in 1846, Sir Henry Lawrence was appointed British Resident and ''Vizir'' [[Lal Singh]] on behalf of infant emperor [[Duleep Singh]] was asked to surrender Kashmir.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collectbritain.co.uk/personalisation/object.cfm?uid=019XZZ000007381U00013000 Raja Lal Singh] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214225152/http://www.collectbritain.co.uk/personalisation/object.cfm?uid=019XZZ000007381U00013000 |date=February 14, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Vizir'' [[Lal Singh]] was also a Dogra, and along with Gulab Singh colluded with the British to deliberately break the Sikh army and facilitate the British victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DQeKTUXphPMC&amp;pg=PA63&amp;lpg=PA63&amp;dq=lal+singh+gulab+singh+betrayed+sikh&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8oG324RbqC&amp;sig=srR4vva_7QfDrN_TJspvDYdomkk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjjiNmz6sPRAhXDQSYKHQBpDA84ChDoAQhGMA8#v=onepage&amp;q=lal%20singh%20gulab%20singh%20betrayed%20sikh&amp;f=false|title=Glimpses of Sikhism|last=Jawandha|first=Major Nahar Singh|date=2010|publisher=Sanbun Publishers|year=|isbn=9789380213255|location=|pages=63, 64|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/t/sikh-wars-and-annexation-of-the-panjab/|title=Sikh Wars &amp; Annexation of the Panjab|last=|first=|date=|website=Victoria and Albert Museum|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the terms of the [[Treaty of Amritsar, 1846|Treaty of Amritsar]] that followed in March 1846, the British government sold Kashmir for a sum of 7.5&amp;nbsp;million Nanakshahee rupees to Gulab Singh, hereafter bestowed with the title of Maharaja. Thus the Princely State of Jammu and Kashmir came into being under Gulab Singh, as per the [[Treaty of Lahore|treaty of Lahore]], signed between the [[United Kingdom|British]] and the [[Sikhs]].

[[Partab Singh of Kashmir|Maharaja Partab Singh]] (enthroned in 1885) saw the construction of Banihal Cart Road (B.C. Road) mainly to facilitate telegraph services. During [[WWI]] he provided one Mountain Battery and three Infantry Battalions to fight for the British in East Africa, Palestine and [[Mesopotamia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailyo.in/politics/world-war-i-dogra-regiment-sikh-battalion-jammu-and-kashmir/story/1/7215.html|title=Why we must not forget J&amp;K state forces who fought World War I|last=Khajuria|first=Manu|date=|website=Daily O|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the services of his troops the state was awarded a hereditary 21-guns salute.

One of the main residences of the maharajas was the [[Sher Garhi Palace]] in their summer capital [[Srinagar]].

He made primary education compulsory in the State, introduced laws prohibiting child marriage and threw open places of worship for the [[Caste system in India|low castes]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Hari Singh was as a member of Churchill's [[British War Cabinet]] in WWII, and supplied troops for the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]].{{sfn|Schofield, Kashmir in Conflict|2003|p=22}}

Singh's reign saw the accession of Jammu &amp; Kashmir to the newly independent [[Indian Union]] in 1947. He originally manoeuvered to maintain his independence by playing off [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] against each other. There was an armed movement against the Maharaja's rule especially in the [[Poonch]] district of Jammu, when his troops were unable to control these fighters and his troops retreated to Jammu, in October 1947, Singh appealed to [[India]] for its help. He acceded to India, though there is considerable controversy over exactly at what point,&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{Cite news|title = Kashmir: The origins of the dispute|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/1762146.stm|newspaper = BBC|date = 2002-01-16|access-date = 2015-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and whether or not his accession included the sovereignty of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/maharaja-wanted-kashmir-to-be-an-independent-country-says-farooq/297460|title=Maharaja Wanted Kashmir To Be An Independent Country, Says Farooq|last=Ganai|first=Naseer|date=2016-12-05|work=|newspaper=Outlook India|access-date=2017-01-15|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/sc-rejects-hc-ruling-no-sovereignty-for-jk-outside-constitution-of-india-4431380/|title=Supreme Court rejects HC ruling: No sovereignty for J-K outside Constitution of India|last=Anand|first=Utkarsh|date=2016-12-17|work=|newspaper=The Indian Express|access-date=2017-01-15|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1952, Singh's rule was terminated by the state government of Indian-administered Kashmir.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = J&amp;K terminates hereditary monarchy - This Day in India|url = http://thisdayinindia.com/jk-terminates-hereditary-monarchy/|website = thisdayinindia.com|accessdate = 2015-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Hindu : dated June 14, 1952: Rulership of Kashmir|url = http://www.thehindu.com/2002/06/14/stories/2002061400870800.htm|website = www.thehindu.com|accessdate = 2015-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; His son [[Yuvraj]] (Crown Prince) [[Karan Singh]] too abdicated and was elected ''Sadr-e-Riyasat'' ('President of the Province') and [[Governor of Jammu and Kashmir|Governor]] of the State in 1964.

'''Ellis Thomas Davies''' (1822&amp;ndash;1895) was a Welsh Independent minister. He grew up in the [[Llanuwchllyn]] area, where his father was an elder in the ‘Old Chapel'. As a boy he attended school at [[Weirglodd Wen]], tutored by the local minister,  Michael Jones. He then continued his education at [[Brecon]] College. He had begun to preach in 1842, and in 1847 began to minister to the churches at Llansantsiôr and [[Moelfre, Conwy|Moelfre]]. After being ordained the following year, he was appointed to the church at [[Abergele]], where he remained for the rest of his ministry, retiring in 1887.

His written works include a translation of G. B. Johnson's ''Statement of Principles'' (1877), and a book of verse.

He died in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ellis Thomas Davies|url=http://wbo.llgc.org.uk/en/s-DAVI-THO-1822.html|website=Dictionary of Welsh Biography|publisher=National Library of Wales|last=Williams|first=Griffith John|accessdate= 4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ex-Mormon''' or '''post-Mormon''' refers to a [[Religious disaffiliation|disaffiliate]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) or any of its [[:Category:Brighamite sects in the Latter Day Saint movement|schismatic breakoffs]], collectively called "[[Mormonism]]". Ex-Mormons—sometimes referred to as '''exmo''' or postmo&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.exmormon.org/bbabrev.html |title=Abbreviations: FOR NEWBIES - Guide to abbreviations used on exmormon.org board |website=Recovery from Mormonism |author= "Deconstructor" |date=September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;—may neither believe in nor affiliate with the LDS Church. In contrast, [[Jack Mormon]]s may believe but do not affiliate; and [[cultural Mormon]]s may or may not affiliate but do not believe in certain doctrines or practices of the institutional LDS Church. The distinction is important to some ex-Mormons, many of whom perceive their decision to leave as morally compelling and socially risky. According to 2014 [[Pew Research Center|Pew]] data, around 1/3 of adults raised LDS are now ex-Mormon (up from around 10% in the '70s and '80s) and only 25% of young adults raised LDS are actively involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Golden|first1=Hallie|title=Why It’s Not Easy Becoming an Ex-Mormon|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/why-its-not-easy-becoming-an-ex-mormon|accessdate=9 June 2017|work=The Daily Beast}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hatch|first1=Heidi|title=Millennial Mormons leaving faith at higher rate than previous generations|url=http://kutv.com/news/local/millennial-mormons-leaving-faith-more-than-previous-generations-are-more-republican|accessdate=9 June 2017|work=KUTV|agency=Sinclair Broadcast Group|date=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many ex-Mormons experience troubles with family members who still follow Mormon teachings.&lt;ref name="Lobdell 2001-12-01"&gt;{{citation |first= William |last= Lobdell |newspaper= [[Los Angeles Times]] |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20011201123951/http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-120101mormons.story |archivedate= 2001-12-01 |url= http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-120101mormons.story |title= Losing Faith and Lots More |date= December 1, 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aggregations of ex-Mormons may comprise a [[social movement]].{{weasel inline|date=June 2015}}

==Reasons for leaving==
{{see also|Criticism of the Latter Day Saint movement}}

Most ex-Mormons leave Mormonism and the LDS Church because specific intellectual or spiritual reasons have led them to a conviction that the religion is false. The foremost reasons are disbelief both in [[Joseph Smith]] as a prophet&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= //www.lds.org/ensign/1989/04/a-warning-from-kirtland |authorlink= Milton V. Backman Jr. |first= Milton V., Jr. |last= Backman |title= A Warning from Kirtland |journal= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] |date=April 1989 |page= 26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Roberts |first= B.H. |authorlink= B.

In addition to rejecting the Book of Mormon for such reasons, the [[Book of Abraham]] and other Mormon religious texts are rejected on similar grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.irr.org/mit/book-of-mormon-page.html |title=Book of Mormon Page |website=Mormons in Transition |publisher=[[Institute for Religious Research]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903005426/http://www.irr.org/mit/book-of-mormon-page.html |archive-date=September 3, 2011}}{{specify|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first= Charles M. |last= Larson |title= By His Own Hand Upon Papyrus |isbn= 0-9620963-2-6 |oclc= 26140322 |year= 1992 |location= Grand Rapids, Michigan |publisher= [[Institute for Religious Research]] |page= {{Page needed|date=September 2011}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of 3000 people who were formerly affiliated with the LDS Church  recorded that 74 percent of respondents cited a disbelief in church doctrine or theology as major reason for leaving the church, but only 4 percent of respondents cited conflict with other church members as a large factor in their decision to leave. Also, just 4 percent claimed that a significant reason for apostasy was dissatisfaction with the rules of conduct professed by the LDS Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.whymormonsquestion.org/survey-results/|title = Understanding Mormon Disbelief Survey – March 2012 Results and Analysis|website = Why Mormons Question|language = en-US|type = PDF Url: http://www.whymormonsquestion.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Survey-Results_Understanding-Mormon-Disbelief-Mar2012-1.pdf|access-date = 2016-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This corroborates the assertion that many Mormons are satisfied with the communal aspect and attributes of LDS Church life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mormon Crisis: Anatomy of a Failing Religion|last = Beverley|first = James|publisher = Castle Quay Books|year = 2013|isbn =|edition = Kindle Edition.|location =|pages = Kindle Locations 76–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals leave Mormonism for a variety of reasons, although "single reason disaffiliates are rare among former Mormons."&lt;ref name=Albrecht2&gt;Albrecht, S.L. &amp; Bahr, H.M. (1989). Strangers Once More: Patterns of Disaffiliation from Mormonism. ''[[Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion]]'' (28)2. 180- 200. {{DOI|10.2307/1387058}} {{JSTOR|1387058}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that 43 percent of ex-Mormon left due to unmet spiritual needs.&lt;ref name="Albrecht1" /&gt; Other reasons for leaving may include a belief that they are in a cult, logical or intellectual appraisal, belief changes or differences, spiritual conversion to another faith, life crises, and poor or hurtful responsiveness by Mormon leaders or congregations.&lt;ref name=Reynolds&gt;{{citation |last= Reynolds |first= Leslie |origyear= 1996 |year= 1998 |title= Mormons in Transition |edition= Second |location= Grand Rapids, Michigan |publisher= [[Baker Books]] |isbn= 978-0-8010-5811-0 |oclc= 38199795 |page= {{page needed|date=September 2011}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of former Mormons surveyed, 58 percent switched to other faiths or practices.&lt;ref name="Albrecht1" /&gt;

Those who adopt [[humanism|humanist]] or [[feminism|feminist]] perspectives may view certain Mormon doctrines (including past teachings on the [[Black people and Mormonism|spiritual status of black people]], [[plural marriage|polygamy]], and the [[Women and Mormonism|role of women in society]]) as [[racist]] or [[sexist]].&lt;ref name=Hanks&gt;{{citation |first= Maxine |last= Hanks |authorlink= Maxine Hanks |url= http://signaturebookslibrary.org/?p=840 |title= Women and Authority: Re-emerging Mormon Feminism |isbn= 1-56085-014-0 |oclc= 25509094 |location= Salt Lake City, Utah |publisher= Signature Books }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A minority of ex-Mormons cite their personal incompatibility with Mormon beliefs or culture.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} A 2003 [[Princeton Review]] publication quoted a student at church-owned [[Brigham Young University]] as stating, "the nonconformist will find a dull social life with difficulty finding someone that will be their friend, regardless of who they are or what they believe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Best Western Colleges|date=2003|publisher=The Princeton Review|isbn=0-375-76338-4|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Liberalism|Liberal]] views and political attitudes that challenge this [[conformity]], and occasionally [[sexual orientation]], are cited as reasons for leaving Mormonism.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.mormoncurtain.com/topic_homosexuality.html |title=TOPICS: LGBT - AND MORMONISM - SECTION 1 |work=The Mormon Curtain |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080403023825/http://www.mormoncurtain.com/topic_homosexuality.html |archive-date=2008-04-03}}{{Unreliable source?|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, the LDS Church has become more politically active, particularly with regard to legislation barring civil marriage for same-sex couples. Official church involvement in the [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|California Proposition 8]] campaign was highly controversial, causing some Mormons to stop attending church.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.abc4.com/content/news/top%20stories/story/Some-LDS-members-leaving-church-over-same-sex/JAb7zCDnBEW-LV6MHW26HQ.cspx |title= Some LDS members leaving church over same-sex marriage controversy |date= 2008-11-10 |first= Chris |last= Vanocur |publisher= [[KTVX]] |location= Salt Lake City }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-disaffiliation issues==

After their decision to leave Mormonism and the LDS Church, ex-Mormons typically go through an adjustment period as they re-orient their lives religiously, socially, and psychologically.

===Religious===
An [[Open access poll|online poll]] of ex-Mormons found that a majority of ex-Mormons do not self-identify as a member of another faith tradition, choosing to describe themselves as [[agnostic]], [[atheism|atheist]] or simply ex-Mormon. Some can also become [[apatheism|apatheist]]. A Pew Research report corroborated this, finding in 2015 that 36% of those born Mormon left the religion, with 21% of born Mormons (58% of ex-Mormons) now unaffiliated, 6% Evangalical Protestant, and 9% converting to other Protestant, Catholic, or a non-Christian faith.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pewforum.org/2015/05/12/chapter-2-religious-switching-and-intermarriage/&lt;/ref&gt; Others either retained belief in God but not in organized religion or became adherents of other faiths.&lt;ref name="misterpoll" /&gt; Among ex-Mormons with no current religious preference, 36 percent continued the practice of [[prayer]] often or daily.&lt;ref name="Albrecht1"&gt;Albrecht, S.L. &amp; Bahr, H.M. (1983). Patterns of Religious Disaffiliation: A Study of Lifelong Mormons, Mormon Converts &amp; Former Mormons. ''[[Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion]]'' 22 D. pp. 366-379. {{DOI|10.2307/1385774}} {{JSTOR|1385774}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ex-Mormon attitudes toward Mormons and Mormonism vary widely. Some ex-Mormons actively proselytize against Mormonism, while some provide only support to others leaving the religion. Other ex-Mormons prefer to avoid the subject entirely, while still others may try to encourage healthy dialogue between adherents of their new faiths and active Mormons. Attitudes of ex-Mormons also differ regarding their church membership. Some formally resign, which the LDS Church refers to as "name removal," while others simply [[Less-active Mormon|stop attending]] church services.

===Social===
Ex-Mormons who publicly leave Mormonism often face social stigmatization. Although many leave to be true to themselves or to a new belief structure, they leave at a cost;&lt;ref name=Albrecht2 /&gt; many leave feeling ostracized and pressured and miss out on major family events such as [[Celestial marriage|temple weddings]]. Family members of some may express only disappointment and sorrow and try to reach out in understanding to their new belief system. Some stay under threat of divorce from spouses that still believe. Still, many ex-Mormons are completely shunned and have given up spouses, children, and the ability to enter Mormon temples to witness life events of family members. Ex-Mormons in geographic locations away from major [[enclaves]] of [[Mormon culture]] such as Utah may experience less stigmatization, however.&lt;ref name="Lobdell 2001-12-01" /&gt;

===Psychological===
Most ex-Mormons go through a psychological process as they leave Mormonism. Former Mormon [[bishop (Latter Day Saints)|bishop]] Bob McCue described his disaffiliation as recovery from [[cognitive dissonance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.culteducation.com/reference/mormon/mormon164.html |title=Former Mormon bishop explains the collapse of his faith |date=June 2004 |department=News Summary |work=The Ross Institute Internet Archives for the Study of Destructive Cults, Controversial Groups and Movements |publisher= [[Rick Ross (consultant)|Rick Ross]]}} {{Unreliable source?|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reynolds reports that leaving involves a period of intense self-doubt and [[Depression (mood)|depression]] as disaffiliates confront feelings of betrayal and loneliness, followed by self-discovery, belief exploration, spiritual guidance and connection as they leave Mormonism.&lt;ref name=Reynolds/&gt; He argues that leaving may provide a renewed sense of self, confidence and peace.&lt;ref name=Reynolds/&gt; One ex-Mormon compared his disaffiliation experience to leaving a [[cult]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.exmormon.org/mission.htm |title=My Mission |first= Eric |last= Kettunen |website=Recovery from Mormonism}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others called it close to overcoming [[mind control]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.exmormon.org/thought.htm |title=Thought reform and conformity within Mormonism |first= Eric |last= Kettunen |website=Recovery from Mormonism}}&lt;/ref&gt; or adjusting to life outside of religious [[fundamentalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first= Marion |last= Stricker |year= 2000 |title= The Pattern of The Double-Bind in Mormonism |url= http://www.universal-publishers.com/book.php?method=ISBN&amp;book=1581127391 |publisher= [[Universal Publishers (USA)|Universal Publishers]] |isbn= 978-1-58112-739-3 |oclc= 46728224}}{{page needed|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still others compare their symptoms to divorce from marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Winell |first=Marlene |title=Leaving the Fold: A Guide for Former Fundamentalists and Others Leaving their Religion |location=Oakland, California |publisher=[[New Harbinger Publications]] |year=1993 |isbn=978-1-879237-51-3 |oclc=30314020 |url=http://www.marlenewinell.net/page/leaving-fold-guide-former}}{{page needed|date=September 2011}}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ex-Mormons may also have to cope with the pain of ostracism by Mormon employers, friends, spouses, and family members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.exmormon.org/mormon/mormon108.htm What did leaving cost you?] (collection of forum posts), exmormon.org{{Unreliable source?|date=September 2011}}&lt;!-- Chat forums are not RS--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ex-Mormon organizations==
Many formerly LDS individuals (sometimes called post-Mormon or "postmos") seek community and discussion about their former beliefs in online and in-person groups. Some of these international groups include the [https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/ ex-Mormon page] on [[Reddit]] (with over 89,000 subscribers), [http://www.postmormon.org PostMormon.org] (with over 9,000 registered users), and [https://web.archive.org/web/20170922234005/http://www.lifeaftermormonism.net/ LifeAfterMormonism.net] (over 3,000 users). Localized groups include the [http://www.meetup.com/postmormons/ SLC Postmos meetup] and Facebook group (with over 2,000 members) and [https://www.meetup.com/UtahValleyPostmormons/ Utah Valley Postmos meetup] and Facebook group (over 900 members).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Miet|first1=Hannah|title=When the Saints Go Marching Out|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2014/01/31/when-saints-go-marching-out-245158.html|accessdate=9 June 2017|work=Newsweek Magazine|agency=Newsweek Media Group|date=30 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ex-Mormon subreddit gained publicity with its involvement leaking LDS documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brown|first1=Jennings|last2=Cuen|first2=Leigh|title=Dark Net: How Reddit Is Dismantling The Mormon Church|url=http://www.vocativ.com/295150/dark-net-mormon/|accessdate=9 June 2017|agency=Vocativ|date=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wenzke|first1=Marissa|title=How the ex-Mormon community has found a home on Reddit|url=http://mashable.com/2016/09/26/former-mormons-reddit/#smDuQ5YKHaqB|accessdate=9 June 2017|work=Mashable}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Latter-day Saint views of ex-Mormons==
Depending on the circumstances of an ex-Mormon's departure, Latter-day Saint views may range from considering them apostates to viewing them as individuals who have simply strayed from the path. The LDS Church teaches that people leave for a variety of reasons.&lt;ref name=SStext/&gt; Reasons range from trivial to serious (including doctrinal disagreements). Latter-day Saints view "denying the [[Holy Spirit]]" as having potentially devastating spiritual consequences, and they generally hope ex-Mormons will "return to the fold."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first= Stack |last= Peggy Fletcher |authorlink= Peggy Fletcher Stack |title= LDS Church President Monson urges disenfranchised to return to the fold |url= http://www.sltrib.com/News/ci_8831639 |newspaper= The Salt Lake Tribune |date= 2008-04-08 |accessdate= 2008-04-26 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080412070910/http://www.sltrib.com/news/ci_8831639 |archivedate= 2008-04-12 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reasons for leaving===

The reasons given for a person leaving the church vary according to who is offering the opinion. LDS Church [[Sunday School (LDS Church)|Sunday School]] manuals say members leave because of unwarranted pride, committing sins which drive them to alienation from God, or because they have taken offense to something trivial. The manuals also claim members leave because they have been deceived by [[Satan]],&lt;ref name=SStext/&gt; who, according to Mormon scripture, is actively seeking to destroy the souls of men.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Doctrine and Covenants|dc|10|27|33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, those who "depart from the truth" will be judged in the final judgment&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|3 Nephi|3-ne|26|4}}&lt;/ref&gt; for falling prey to this deception.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Doctrine and Covenants|dc|20|15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deceptions that Satan uses include acceptance of a [[false prophet]], pride and vanity, being critical of leaders' imperfections, being offended, rationalizing disobedience, and accepting the false teachings of the world.&lt;ref name=SStext&gt;{{citation |chapter-url= //www.lds.org/manual/doctrine-and-covenants-and-church-history-gospel-doctrine-teachers-manual/lesson-24-be-not-deceived-but-continue-in-steadfastness |chapter= Lesson 24: "Be Not Deceived, but Continue in Steadfastness" |title= Doctrine and Covenants and Church History Gospel Doctrine Teacher’s Manual |page= 134 |year= 2003 |id= Publication: 35685 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
	
In the [[Book of Mormon]], a figure named [[Korihor]]&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Alma|alma|30}}&lt;/ref&gt; preaches disbelief and challenges prophecies and church leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Alma|alma|30|27}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then demands a miracle and is miraculously struck mute for the acts. One Mormon scholar likened the [[philosophical analysis]] employed in an essay compilation edited by an ex-Mormon to Korihor's tactics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Robinson |first=Stephen E. |authorlink=Stephen E. Robinson |coauthors= |year=1991 |month= |title=Review of ''The Word of God: Essays on Mormon Scripture'' by Dan Vogel |journal=FARMS Review of Books |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=312–318 |url=http://farms.byu.edu/display.php?table=review&amp;id=74 |accessdate=2008-04-13 |publisher=[[Maxwell Institute]], [[Brigham Young University|BYU]] |location=Provo, Utah |postscript=. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070417210418/http://farms.byu.edu/display.php?table=review&amp;id=74 |archivedate=April 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Church authority and popular [[LDS fiction]] writer [[Gerald N.

Lund |date=July 1992 |journal= Ensign }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mormon historian [[B. H. Roberts]] wrote of an account of a member leaving the LDS Church over the misspelling of a name in church records.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Roberts |first=B.H. |authorlink=B. H. Roberts |coauthors= |editor= |others= |title=[[History of the Church (Joseph Smith)|History of the Church]] |origyear= |origmonth= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |volume=1 |date= |year=1902 |month= |publisher= |location= |language= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |id=  |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote=|page=261 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The LDS Church has used the story of Frazier Eaton (who gave $700 for the [[Kirtland Temple]] but left after being unable to get a seat at the dedication ceremony) as an object lesson on how members can leave after being offended.&lt;ref name="SStext"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Smith |first=George A. |authorlink=George A. Smith |coauthors= |editor= |others= |title=[[Journal of Discourses]] |origyear= |origmonth= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |volume=11 |date= |year=1867 |month= |publisher= |location= |language= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |id=  |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote=|page=9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consequences of leaving===
Latter-day Saints may view ex-Mormons as stronger candidates for eternal damnation based on their former devotion to Mormonism, since those who were never adherents [[Parable of the Faithful Servant|will be judged more lightly]]. In addition, one who goes so far as to [[Eternal sin|deny the Holy Spirit]] could become a [[Son of perdition (Mormonism)|son of perdition]] and be cast into [[outer darkness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= //www.lds.org/ensign/1981/05/light-and-truth |authorlink= Theodore M. Burton |first= Theodore M. |last= Burton |title= Light and Truth |journal= Ensign |date=May 1981 |page= 28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Outright [[apostasy]] of members will lead to a church [[disciplinary council]], which may result in [[disfellowshipment]] or [[excommunication]].&lt;ref name=Ballard&gt;{{Citation |last= Ballard |first= M. Russell |authorlink= M. Russell Ballard |date=September 1990 |title= A Chance to Start Over: Church Disciplinary Councils and the Restoration of Blessings |journal= Ensign |volume= 20 |issue= 9 |page= 12 |url= //www.lds.org/ensign/1990/09/a-chance-to-start-over-church-disciplinary-councils-and-the-restoration-of-blessings |accessdate= 2011-09-26 |postscript= . }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, members who ask for their names to be removed from church records or who have joined another church are not subject to a disciplinary council.&lt;ref name=Ballard/&gt;

[[Brigham Young]], a [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|president]] of the LDS Church, taught that members who openly disagree with church leaders are potentially cursed or condemned and that those who reject Mormon doctrine or authority outright are "[[Apostasy|apostate]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |chapter-url= //www.lds.org/manual/teachings-brigham-young/chapter-12 |chapter= Chapter 12: Preventing Personal Apostasy |title= [[Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Brigham Young]] |year= 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An early Mormon epistle teaches that apostates have "fallen into the snares of the evil one."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |editor1-first= Joseph F. |editor1-last= Smith |editor1-link= Joseph F. Smith |year= 1938 |title= [[Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith (book)|Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith]] |publisher= [[Deseret Book]] |location= Salt Lake City |oclc= 718055 |page= 66 }} &lt;br /&gt; Although sometimes mistaken for a direct quote from Joseph Smith, this passage occurs in the book as part of "Excerpts from an Epistle of the Elders of the Church in Kirtland to Their Brethren Abroad", edited by [[Oliver Cowdery]] and [[Frederick G. Williams]] as published in the ''[[Evening and Morning Star]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Young also said that "[if] there is a despicable character on the face of the earth, it is an apostate from this Church. He is a traitor who has deceived his best friends, betrayed his trust, and forfeited every principle of honor that God placed within him. They may think they are respected, but they are not. They are disgraced in their own eyes. There is not much honesty within them; they have forfeited their heaven, sold their birthright, and betrayed their friends."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |journal= [[Journal of Discourses]] |volume= 12 |page= 94 |author-link= Brigham Young |first= Brigham |last= Young |year= 1867 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gardnerian Wicca''', or '''Gardnerian witchcraft''', is a 
&lt;!--  Commented out: [[mystery cult]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hunt, Stephen |title=Alternative religions: a sociological introduction |publisher=Ashgate |location=Aldershot, Hants, England |year=2003 |pages=151 |isbn=0-7546-3410-8 }} "Wicca is essentially a mystery cult"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ben Gruagach |title=The Wiccan Mystic |publisher=WitchGrotto Press |location= |year=2007 |pages=30 |isbn=0-615-14311-3}} "When [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]] first started promoting Wicca in the 1950 the religion met all three basic criteria for a mystery cult."&lt;/ref&gt;]] --&gt;
tradition in the [[neopagan]] religion of [[Wicca]], whose members can trace initiatory descent from [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=gaDFBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA248&amp;lpg=PA248&amp;dq=Gardnerian+Wicca,+or+Gardnerian+witchcraft,+is+a+tradition+in+the+neopagan+religion+of+Wicca,+whose+members+can+trace+initiatory+descent+from+Gerald+Gardner.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zRO5ckzlfK&amp;sig=yk_1mQQcfxVg-EM_LpdoN_Cl7CM&amp;hl=ko&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjgzL65m9bXAhVHyLwKHYTtAuAQ6AEIQTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Gardnerian%20Wicca,%20or%20Gardnerian%20witchcraft,%20is%20a%20tradition%20in%20the%20neopagan%20religion%20of%20Wicca,%20whose%20members%20can%20trace%20initiatory%20descent%20from%20Gerald%20Gardner.&amp;f=false|title=THE BOOK OF LIFE, KNOWLEDGE AND CONFIDENCE|last=Dr|first=STEVE ESOMBA|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=9781471734632|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tradition is itself named after Gardner (1884–1964), a British [[civil servant]] and amateur scholar of [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]]. The term "Gardnerian" was probably coined by the founder of [[Cochrane's Craft|Cochranian Witchcraft]], [[Robert Cochrane (witch)|Robert Cochrane]] in the 1950s or 60s, who himself left that tradition to found his own.&lt;ref&gt;''The Rebirth of Witchcraft'', Doreen Valiente, page 122&lt;/ref&gt;

Gardner claimed to have learned the beliefs and practises that would later become known as Gardnerian Wicca from the [[New Forest coven]], who allegedly initiated him into their ranks in 1939. For this reason, Gardnerian Wicca is usually considered to be the earliest created tradition of Wicca, from which most subsequent Wiccan traditions are derived.

From the supposed New Forest coven, Gardner formed his own [[Bricket Wood coven]], and in turn initiated many Witches, including a series of High Priestesses, founding further covens and continuing the initiation of more Wiccans into the tradition. In the UK, Europe and most Commonwealth countries someone self-defined as Wiccan is usually understood to be claiming initiatory descent from Gardner, either through Gardnerian Wicca, or through a derived branch such as [[Alexandrian Wicca]] or [[Algard Wicca]]. Elsewhere, these original lineaged traditions are termed "[[British Traditional Wicca]]".

==Beliefs and practices==

===Covens and initiatory lines===
Gardnerian Wiccans organise into [[coven]]s, that traditionally, though not always, are limited to thirteen members. Covens are led by a High Priestess and the High Priest of her choice, and celebrate both a Goddess and a God.

Gardnerian Wicca and other forms of [[British Traditional Wicca]] operate as an initiatory [[mystery cult]]; membership is gained only through [[initiation]] by a Wiccan High Priestess or High Priest. Any valid line of initiatory descent can be traced all the way back to [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], and through him back to the [[New Forest coven]].

Rituals and coven practices are kept secret from non-initiates, and many Wiccans maintain secrecy regarding their membership in the Religion. Whether any individual Wiccan chooses secrecy or openness often depends on their location, career, and life circumstances. In all cases, Gardnerian Wicca absolutely forbids any member to share the name, personal information, fact of membership, and so on without advanced individual consent of that member for that specific instance of sharing. (In this regard, secrecy is specifically for reasons of safety, in parallel to the LGBT custom of being "in the closet", the heinousness of the act of "outing" anyone, and the dire possibilities of the consequences to an individual who is "outed". Wiccans often refer to being in or out of the "broom closet", to make the exactness of the parallel clear.)

In Gardnerian Wicca, there are three grades of initiation. [[Ronald Hutton]] suggests that they appear to be based upon the three grades of [[Freemasonry]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Triumph of the Moon'', [[Ronald Hutton]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=January 2009}}

===Theology===
In Gardnerian Wicca, the two principal deities are the [[Horned God]] and the [[Mother Goddess]]. Gardnerians use specific names for the God and the Goddess in their rituals. [[Doreen Valiente]], a Gardnerian High Priestess, revealed that there were more than one. She said that Gardner referred to the Goddess as Airdia or Areda, which she believed was derived from [[Aradia]], the deity that [[Charles Leland]] claimed was worshipped by Italian witches. She said that the God was called [[Cernunnos]], or Kernunno, which in Celtic meant "The Horned One". Another name by which Gardnerians called the God was Janicot (pronounced Jan-e-ko{{Clarify|date=October 2018|reason=please use IPA (Help:IPA) or respelling (Help:Pronunciation respelling key)}}), which she believed was [[Basque language|Basque]] in origin.&lt;ref&gt;''The Rebirth of Witchcraft'', Doreen Valiente, page 52-53&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethics and morality===
{{refimprove section|date=December 2008|talk=y}}

The Gardnerian tradition teaches a core ethical guideline, often referred to as "The Rede" or "The [[Wiccan Rede]]". In the archaic language often retained in some Gardnerian lore, the Rede states, "An it harm none, do as thou wilt."&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, Gerald Brousseau; The Meaning of Witchcraft; Aquarian Press, London, 1959, page 127&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Witches ... are inclined to the morality of the legendary Good King Pausol, “Do what you like so long as you harm no one". But they believe a certain law to be important, “You must not use magic for anything which will cause harm to anyone, and if, to prevent a greater wrong being done, you must discommode someone, you must do it only in a way which will abate the harm."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Two features stand out about the Rede. The first is that the word rede means "advice" or "counsel". The Rede is not a commandment but a recommendation, a guideline.  The second is that the advice to harm none stands at equal weight with the advice to do as one wills. Thus Gardnerian Wiccan teachings stand firm against coercion and for [[informed consent]]; forbid proselytization while requiring anyone seeking to become an initiate of Gardnerian Wicca to ask for teaching, studies, initiation. To expound a little further, the qualifying phrase "an (if) it harm none" includes not only other, but self. Hence, weighing the possible outcomes of an action is a part of the thought given before taking an action; the metaphor of tossing a pebble into a pond and observing the ripples that spread in every direction is sometimes used. The declarative statement "do as thou wilt" expresses a clear statement of what is, philosophically, known as "[[free will]]."&lt;ref&gt;Gregg D Caruso (2012). Free Will and Consciousness: A Determinist Account of the Illusion of Free Will. Lexington Books. p. 8. {{ISBN|0739171364}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second ethical guideline is often called the Law of Return, sometimes the Rule of Three, which mirrors the physics concept described in Sir [[Isaac Newton]]'s Third Law of Motion: "When one body exerts a force on a second body, the second body simultaneously exerts a force equal in magnitude and opposite in direction on the first body."&lt;ref&gt;[[Newton's laws of motion]]&lt;/ref&gt; This basic law of physics is more usually today stated thus: "For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/newton3.html&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Rede, this guideline teaches Gardnerians that whatever energy or intention one puts out into the world, whether magical or not, some response of equal effect will return. This teaching underlies the importance of doing no harm—for that would give impetus to a negative reaction centered on oneself or one's group (such as a coven).

In Gardnerian Wicca, these tradition-specific teachings demand thought before action, especially magical action (spell work). An individual or a coven uses these guidelines to consider beforehand what the possible ramifications may be of any working. Given these two ethical core principles, Gardnerian Wicca hold themselves to a high ethical standard. For example, Gardnerian High Priestess Eleanor Bone was not only a respected elder in the tradition, but also a matron of a nursing home. Moreover, the Bricket Wood coven today is well known for its many members from academic or intellectual backgrounds, who contribute to the preservation of Wiccan knowledge. Gerald Gardner himself actively disseminated educational resources on folklore and the occult to the general public through his Museum of Witchcraft on the Isle of Man. Therefore, Gardnerian Wicca can be said to differ from some modern non-coven Craft practices that often concentrate on the solitary practitioner's spiritual development.

The religion tends to be non-dogmatic, allowing each initiate to find for him/herself what the ritual experience means by using the basic language of the shared ritual tradition, to be discovered through the Mysteries.&lt;ref&gt;Akasha and Eran (1996). "Gardnerian Wicca: An Introduction" http://bichaunt.org/Gardnerian.html&lt;/ref&gt; The tradition is often characterised as an [[orthopraxy]] (correct practice) rather than an [[orthodoxy]] (correct thinking), with adherents placing greater emphasis on a shared body of practices as opposed to faith.&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Muntean (2006) "A Witch in the Halls of Wisdom" interview conducted by Sylvana Silverwitch http://www.widdershins.org/vol1iss3/l03.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Gardner and the New Forest coven===
{{Main|New Forest coven}}

On retirement from the British Colonial Service, Gardner moved to London but then before [[World War II]] moved to [[Highcliffe]], east of [[Bournemouth]] and near the [[New Forest]] on the south coast of England. After attending a performance staged by the [[Rosicrucian Order Crotona Fellowship]], he reports meeting a group of people who had preserved their historic occult practices. They recognised him as being "one of them" and convinced him to be initiated. It was only halfway through the initiation, he says, that it dawned on him what kind of group it was, and that witchcraft was still being practiced in England.&lt;ref name="Gardner, Gerald 1954"&gt;Gardner, Gerald (1954). ''Witchcraft Today'' London: Rider and Company&lt;/ref&gt;

The group into which Gardner was initiated, known as the [[New Forest coven]], was small and utterly secret as the [[Witchcraft Act of 1735]] made it illegal—a crime—to claim to predict the future, conjure spirits, or cast spells; it likewise made an accusation of witchcraft a criminal offense. Gardner's enthusiasm over the discovery that witchcraft survived in England led him to wish to document it, but both the witchcraft laws and the coven's secrecy forbade that, despite his excitement. After World War II, Gardner's High Priestess and coven leader relented sufficiently to allow a fictional treatment that did not expose them to prosecution, "High Magic's Aid".&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Gardner (1949). ''High Magic's Aid'' London: Michael Houghton&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Anyhow, I soon found myself in the circle and took the usual oaths of secrecy which bound me not to reveal any secrets of the cult. But, as it is a dying cult, I thought it was a pity that all the knowledge should be lost, so in the end I was permitted to write, as fiction, something of what a witch believes in the novel High Magic's Aid.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref name="Gardner, Gerald 1954"/&gt;

After the witchcraft laws were repealed in 1951, and replaced by the Fraudulent Mediums Act, Gerald Gardner went public, publishing his first non-fiction book about [[Witchcraft]], "Witchcraft Today", in 1954. Gardner continued, as the text often iterates, to respect his oaths and the wishes of his High Priestess in his writing.&lt;ref name="Gardner, Gerald 1954"/&gt; Fearing, as Gardner stated in the quote above, that witchcraft was literally dying out, he pursued publicity and welcomed new initiates during that last years of his life. Gardner even courted the attentions of the tabloid press, to the consternation of some more conservative members of the tradition. In Gardner's own words, "Witchcraft doesn't pay for broken windows!"&lt;ref name="Gardner, Gerald 1954"/&gt;

Gardner knew many famous occultists. Ross Nichols was a friend and fellow Druid (until 1964 Chairman of the [[Ancient Order of Druids]], when he left to found his own Druidic [[Order of Bards, Ovates, and Druids]]). Nichols edited Gardner's "Witchcraft Today" and is mentioned extensively in Gardner's "The Meaning of Witchcraft". Near the end of [[Aleister Crowley]]'s life, Gardner met with him for the first time on May 1, 1947, and visited him twice more before Crowley's death that autumn; at some point, Crowley gave Gardner an [[Ordo Templi Orientis]] (OTO) charter and the 4th OTO degree—the lowest degree authorizing use of the charter.&lt;ref&gt;"Gardner &amp; Crowley: the Overstated Connection" [[Don Frew]] Pantheacon 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Doreen Valiente]], one of Gardner's priestesses, identified the woman who initiated Gardner as [[Dorothy Clutterbuck]], referenced in "A Witches' Bible" by [[Janet Farrar|Janet]] and [[Stewart Farrar]].&lt;ref&gt;Farrar, Janet &amp; Stewart (2002). "A Witches' Bible." Robert Hale. {{ISBN|0-7090-7227-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Valiente's identification was based on references Gardner made to a woman he called "Old Dorothy" whom Valiente remembered. Biographer [[Philip Heselton]] corrects Valiente, clarifying that Clutterbuck (Dorothy St. Quintin-Fordham, {{née}} Clutterbuck), a Pagan-minded woman, owned the Mill House, where the New Forest coven performed Gardner's initiation ritual.&lt;ref&gt;Heselton, Philip (2012). "Witchfather: A Life of Gerald Gardner. Volume 1: Into the Witch Cult." Loughborough, Leicestershire: Thoth Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;  Scholar [[Ronald Hutton]] argues in his ''Triumph of the Moon'' that Gardner's tradition was largely the inspiration of members of the [[Rosicrucian Order Crotona Fellowship]] and especially that of a woman known by the magical name of "[[Edith Woodford-Grimes|Dafo]]".&lt;ref&gt;Hutton, Ronald (2001). ''The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-285449-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. [[Leo Ruickbie]], in his ''Witchcraft Out of the Shadows'', analysed the documented evidence and concluded that [[Aleister Crowley]] played a crucial role in inspiring Gardner to establish a new pagan religion.&lt;ref&gt;[[Leo Ruickbie|Ruickbie, Leo]](2004). ''Witchcraft out of the Shadows: A Complete History''. Robert Hale Limited. {{ISBN|0-7090-7567-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruickbie, Hutton, and others further argue that much of what has been published of Gardnerian Wicca, as Gardner's practice came to be known, was written by Blake, Yeats, [[Doreen Valiente|Valiente]] and [[Aleister Crowley|Crowley]] and contains borrowings from other identifiable sources.&lt;ref&gt;Hutton, ''Triumph of the Moon'' p.237&lt;/ref&gt;

The witches Gardner was originally introduced to were originally referred to by him as "the Wica" and he would often use the term "Witch [[Cult (religious practice)|Cult]]" to describe the religion. Other terms used, included "Witchcraft" or "the Old Religion." Later publications standardised the spelling to "Wicca" and it came to be used as the term for the Craft, rather than its followers. "Gardnerian" was originally a pejorative term used by Gardner's contemporary Roy Bowers (also known as Robert Cochrane), a British [[cunning man]],&lt;ref&gt;''Pentagram'' magazine 1965&lt;/ref&gt; who nonetheless was initiated into Gardnerian Wicca a couple of years following Gardner's death.&lt;ref&gt;Doyle White, Ethan (2011). "Robert Cochrane and the Gardnerian Craft: Feuds, Secrets, and Mysteries in Contemporary British Witchcraft". The Pomegranate: The International Journal of Pagan Studies 13 (2): 205–224.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reconstruction of the Wiccan rituals===
Gardner stated that the rituals of the existing group were fragmentary at best, and he set about fleshing them out, drawing on his library and knowledge as an [[occult]]ist and amateur [[folklorist]]. Gardner borrowed and wove together appropriate material from other artists and occultists, most notably [[Charles Godfrey Leland]]'s ''[[Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches]]'', the [[Key of Solomon]] as published by [[Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers|S.L. MacGregor Mathers]], [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] ritual, Crowley, and [[Rudyard Kipling]]. [[Doreen Valiente]] wrote much of the best-known poetry, including the much-quoted [[Charge of the Goddess]].&lt;ref&gt;Hutton, ''Triumph of the Moon'' p.247&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bricket Wood and the North London coven===
In 1948-9 Gardner and [[Edith Woodford-Grimes|Dafo]] were running a coven separate from the original New Forest coven at a [[naturist]] club near [[Bricket Wood]] to the north of London.&lt;ref&gt;Hutton, ''Triumph of the Moon'' p.227.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1952 Dafo's health had begun to decline, and she was increasingly wary of Gardner's publicity-seeking.&lt;ref&gt;[[Doreen Valiente|Valiente, Doreen]]. ''The Rebirth of Witchcraft'' (1989) Custer, WA: Phoenix. pp 38,66.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953 Gardner met [[Doreen Valiente]] who was to become his High Priestess in succession to Dafo. The question of publicity led to Doreen and others formulating thirteen proposed 'Rules for the Craft',&lt;ref&gt;[[Aidan Kelly|Kelly, Aidan]]. ''Crafting the Art of Magic'' (1991) St Paul, MN: Llewellyn. pp 103-5, 145-161.&lt;/ref&gt; which included restrictions on contact with the press. Gardner responded with the sudden production of the [[Wiccan Laws]] which led to some of his members, including Valiente, leaving the coven.&lt;ref&gt;Hutton, ''Triumph of the Moon'' p249.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gardner reported that witches were taught that the power of the human body can be released, for use in a coven's circle, by various means, and released more easily without clothing. A simple method was dancing round the circle singing or chanting;&lt;ref name="Gardner, Gerald 1954"/&gt; another method was the traditional "binding and scourging."&lt;ref name=Scholars&gt;{{cite news|last=Allen|first=Charlotte|title=The Scholars and the Goddess|url=http://www.culteducation.com/reference/wicca/wicca29.html|accessdate=17 March 2012|newspaper=Atlantic Monthly|date=Jan., 2001, vol. 287, issue 1.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to raising power, "binding and scourging" can heighten the initiates' sensitivity and spiritual experience.&lt;ref name=Scourge&gt;{{cite web|last=Anon. (Used with permission from the author)|title=The Scourge and the Kiss|url=http://pagantheologies.pbworks.com/w/page/13622306/The%20Scourge%20and%20the%20Kiss|work=Gardnerian Wicca|publisher=PB Works|accessdate=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the time Gardner spent on the Isle of Man, the coven began to experiment with circle dancing as an alternative.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fred Lamond|Lamond, Frederic]]. ''Fifty Years of Wicca'' Sutton Mallet, England: Green Press. {{ISBN|0-9547230-1-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also about this time that the lesser 4 of the 8 Sabbats were given greater prominence. Brickett Wood coven members liked the Sabbat celebrations so much, they decided that there was no reason to keep them confined to the closest full moon meeting, and made them festivities in their own right. As Gardner had no objection to this change suggested by the Brickett Wood coven, this collective decision resulted in what is now the standard eight festivities in the Wiccan [[Wheel of the year]].&lt;ref&gt;Lamond, ''Fifty Years of Wicca'', p.16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The split with Valiente led to the Bricket Wood coven being led by Jack Bracelin and a new High Priestess, Dayonis. This was the first of a number of disputes between individuals and groups,&lt;ref&gt;Hutton, ''Triumph of the Moon''&lt;/ref&gt; but the increased publicity only seems to have allowed Gardnerian Wicca to grow much more rapidly. Certain initiates such as [[Alex Sanders (Wiccan)|Alex Sanders]] and [[Raymond Buckland]] who brought his take on the Gardnerian tradition to the United States in 1964 started off their own major traditions allowing further expansion.

A partial summary of publicly known Wiccan descendants from Gardner is available [http://www.thewica.co.uk/wica/wica.htm here].

[[File:Floresta Boyaca - Panoramica.JPG|thumb|right|250px|View of the sacred '''Iraca Valley''' ([[Floresta, Boyacá|Tobasía]])]] 
The '''''iraca''''', sometimes spelled '''''iraka''''',&lt;ref name=Ocampo_p77&gt;Ocampo López, 2013, Ch.12, p.77&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ocampo_p85&gt;Ocampo López, 2013, Ch.14, p.85&lt;/ref&gt; was the [[Muisca rulers|ruler]]  and high priest of [[Sogamoso|Sugamuxi]] in the [[Muisca Confederation|confederation]] of the [[Muisca people|Muisca]] who inhabited the [[Altiplano Cundiboyacense]]; the central highlands of the [[Colombia]]n [[Andes]]. ''Iraca'' can also refer to the '''Iraka Valley''' over which they ruled.&lt;ref name=Ocampo_p77/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ocampo_p85/&gt;&lt;ref name=Humbweb&gt;{{es}} [http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/exhibiciones/humboldt/diario/19.htm Life of Alexander von Humboldt - Ciudad de Santa Fe]&lt;/ref&gt; Important [[List of Muisca scholars|scholars]] who wrote about the ''iraca'' were [[Lucas Fernández de Piedrahita]], [[Alexander von Humboldt]] and [[Ezequiel Uricoechea]].

== Background ==
[[File:Templo del sol.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Reconstruction of the '''[[Sun Temple (Sogamoso)|Sun Temple]]''' of Sugamuxi, where the ''iraca'' lived]]
In the centuries before the Spanish [[conquistador]]es entered central Colombia in the 1530s, the valleys of the [[Cordillera Oriental (Colombia)|Eastern Ranges]] were ruled by four main leaders and several independent ''[[cacique]]s''. The northern territories were ruled by the ''[[zaque]]'' from [[Tunja|Hunza]], the present-day capital of [[Boyacá Department|Boyacá]] [[departments of Colombia|department]] and the southern area under the reign of the ''[[zipa]]'', based in [[Bogotá|Bacatá]], currently known as the Colombian capital Bogotá. Other important rulers were the ''iraca'' and the ''cacique'' [[Tundama]] based in [[Duitama|Tundama]], today known as the city of Duitama. The Muisca were one of the four advanced civilizations of the Americas, between the [[Aztec civilization|Aztec]] and [[Maya civilization]] in the north and the [[Inca Empire|Incas]] south of Colombia.&lt;ref&gt;Ocampo López, 2007, p.52&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
[[File:Sugamuxi.jpg|thumb|right|250px|'''Sugamuxi''', the last ''iraca'']]
The ''iraca'' was a ''cacique'' of the sacred City of the Sun Sugamuxi, present-day [[Sogamoso]]. His domain was a territory spreading over [[Sogamoso]], [[Pesca]], [[Iza, Boyacá|Iza]], [[Floresta, Boyacá|Tobasía]], [[Firavitoba]], [[Busbanzá]], [[Toca, Boyacá|Toca]], [[Gámeza]], [[Tota, Boyacá|Tota]], [[Mongua]] and areas adjacent to [[Lake Tota]].&lt;ref name=Pueblos&gt;{{es}} [http://pueblosoriginarios.com/biografias/iraca.html Iraca rulers] - Pueblos Originarios&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''iraca'' was both a political and a religious leader (priest), in the [[Muisca religion|religion]] of the Muisca said to have descended from [[Idacansás]] and educated by messenger god [[Bochica]]. It is thought that the ''iracas'' inherited the knowledge of Bochica from their predecessors.&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [https://www.udistrital.edu.co/universidad/colombia/historia/prehispanica/muiscas/sugamuxi/ Sugamuxi] - [[District University of Bogotá|Universidad Distrital Francisco José de Caldas]]&lt;/ref&gt; The role of ''iraca'' was widely respected in the Muisca territories and also was important for the [[Muisca astronomy|astronomy of the Muisca]].&lt;ref&gt;Langebaek Rueda et al., 2005, p.281&lt;/ref&gt; The ''iraca'' was elected by the ''caciques'' of Gámeza, Busbanzá, Pesca and Toca. Generally a ''cacique'' from Tobasía or Firavitoba was elected alternatingly. In cases where the election was indecisive, the ''[[tundama]]'' of [[Duitama|Tundama]] would intervene.&lt;ref name=Pueblos/&gt;

The ''iraca'' of Sugamuxi lived in the [[Sun Temple (Sogamoso)|Sun Temple]], the most important temple of the Muisca, built to worship the Muisca Sun god [[Sué]], in Sugamuxi, decorated inside with [[gold]]en figures; ''[[tunjo]]s'' and golden plates outside.&lt;ref name=Pueblos/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://sogamoso-boyaca.gov.co/informacion_general.shtml Official website Sogamoso]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sun Temple was destroyed by fire from the torches of soldiers in the army of [[Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada]], the conquistador who made first contact with the Muisca in September 1537 in search of [[El Dorado]].&lt;ref name=SunTemple&gt;{{es}} [http://pueblosoriginarios.com/sur/caribe/muisca/sogamoso.html Temple of the Sun - Sogamoso] - Pueblos Originarios&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rozabal.JPG|thumbnail|250px|The [[Roza Bal]] shrine in [[Srinagar]], Kashmir, claimed by the Ahmadis to be the tomb of Jesus.]]
{{Ahmadiyya|Distinct views}}
The [[Ahmadiyya movement]] believe that [[Jesus]] survived [[Crucifixion of Jesus|The Crucifixion]] and migrated eastward towards [[Kashmir]] to escape persecution. He went on to spread his message to the [[Lost Tribes of Israel]] after he had carried out his mission to the Israelites in [[Judea (Roman province)|Judea]]. Living to old age, he later died a natural death in [[Srinagar]], Kashmir.

The Ahmadiyya Movement consider Jesus a mortal man and a prophet of God, born to the [[Mary in Islam|virgin Mary]], in line with contemporary [[Jesus in Islam|Islamic views on Jesus]].
Ahmadiyya however diverges from the majority Islamic view that Jesus was [[Islamic view of Jesus' death|raised up to Heaven and remains alive there]].

According to Ahmadiyya, a literal interpretation of some of Jesus' miracles in the [[Quran]] (such as creating birds and bringing the dead back to life) is inconsistent with the Quran and attributes a semi-divine status to Jesus. This understanding is therefore rejected for a [[hermeneutic]] approach to understanding the Quranic verses on account of these actions.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.alislam.org/quran/tafseer/?page=399&amp;region=E1 English 5 Vol. Commentary&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Jesus bringing the dead back to life is understood in the context of bringing back a 'spiritual' life to people who were spiritually dead.

Ahmadi scholars consider the contemporary Islamic views of the second coming of Jesus (see [[Prophethood (Ahmadiyya)|Ahmadi prophetology]]) as inaccurate. The view of Jesus' expected return in person is deemed as mistaken since the return of an [[Israelite]] prophet after [[Muhammad]] is seen as violating the [[Khatam an-Nabiyyin|finality]] of Muhammad's prophethood and of the Islamic dispensation. Jesus is believed to have died a natural death, like all other prophets. In the Quran and [[Hadith]] there is an absence of the use of terms such as ''return'' or ''second coming'' with reference to Jesus' advent in the end times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.alislam.org/library/articles/Advent-of-Messiah-Descend-or-Return.pdf | title=Advent of the Messiah—Descend or Return?| accessdate=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;The movement interpret the prophecies concerning Jesus's end time advent as allegorical - expressing the coming of a person (from within Islam itself) being in the "likeness" of Jesus. The prophecies are merged with those concerning the coming of the [[Mahdi]]. Both the terms ''Jesus Son of Mary'' and ''Mahdi'' (as used in Islamic eschatological literature) are understood interchangeably as two titles for the same person.
Ahmadis believe these prophecies have been fulfilled in the person of [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]], the founder of the movement. Ahmadiyya believe that the [[Turin Shroud]] is authentic.&lt;ref name="alislam"&gt;{{cite book|title=The True Story of Jesus|publisher=Islam International Publications Ltd.|location=United Kingdom|isbn=978-1-85372-625-5|page=95|url=http://www.alislam.org/topics/jesus/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The idea of Jesus having [[unknown years of Jesus|travelled to India]] had been put forth before the foundation of the Ahmadiyya movement, most notably by [[Nicolas Notovitch]] in 1894.&lt;ref name="Nicolas Notovitch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reluctant-messenger.com/issa.htm|title=The Lost Years of Jesus: The Life of Saint Issa - Notovitch|first=Internet Innovations,|last=Inc.|publisher=|accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wil84&gt;''New Testament Apocrypha, Vol. 1: Gospels and Related Writings'' by [[Wilhelm Schneemelcher]] and R. Mcl. Wilson (Dec 1, 1990) {{ISBN|066422721X}} page 84 "a particular book by Nicolas Notovich (Di Lucke im Leben Jesus 1894) ... shortly after the publication of the book, the reports of travel experiences were widely rejected.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mirzā Ghulām Ahmad|Ghulām Ahmad]], in his treatise [[Jesus in India (book)|Jesus in India]] (Urdu: ''Masih Hindustan Mein''), proposed a post-crucifixion journey arguing that Jesus survived crucifixion and travelled to India only ''after'' his apparent death in Jerusalem. He expressly rejected the theory of a pre-crucifixion visit (as Notovitch had postulated).&lt;ref name="Faruqi_1983_98"&gt;{{harvnb|Faruqi|1983|p=98}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SchaeferCohen"&gt;{{harvnb|Schäfer|Cohen|1998|p=306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The teaching was further researched by Ahmadi missionaries. [[Kamal ud-Din]] and [[Khwaja Nazir Ahmad]] (1952), who added to Notovitch's theory of his first earlier visit.&lt;ref&gt;[[Per Beskow]] in The Blackwell Companion to Jesus Delbert Burkett - 2011 " Ahmad's primary source is a legend, known in the West as the tale of Barlaam and Josaphat. It was widely read all through the Middle Agesas an edifying ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ShaeferCohen"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Schäfer|first=Peter|last2=Cohen|first2=Mark R.|title=Toward the Millennium: Messianic Expectations from the Bible to Waco|year=1998|location=Leiden/Princeton|publisher=Brill/Princeton UP|isbn=978-90-04-11037-3|page=306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
The first response in English to Ahmad's teaching came in a book by [[Howard Walter]], an Urdu-speaking American pastor in [[Lahore]], ''The Ahmadiyya Movement'' (1918). Walter, like later scholars, identified the Islamic version of the [[Barlaam and Josaphat]] story as the primary source of Ahmad's evidence despite the fact that the four chapters of his book are arranged around evidence from the [[Gospels]], the [[Quran]] and [[hadith]], medical literature and historical records – respectively.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alislam.org/library/books/Jesus-in-India.pdf Jesus in India&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ahmadiyya teaching the [[Roza Bal]] tomb in [[Srinagar]], which contains the grave of a holy man known as Yuz Asaf, is actually the tomb of Jesus of Nazareth.&lt;ref name="EI"&gt;{{harvnb|Houtsma|1913|p=260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the material of Notovitch and Ahmad has been examined and dismissed by historians such as the Indologist [[Günter Grönbold]] (1985)&lt;ref&gt;Günter Grönbold, Jesus In Indien, München: Kösel 1985, {{ISBN|3-466-20270-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Norbert Klatt]] (1988).,&lt;ref&gt;Norbert Klatt, ''Lebte Jesus in Indien?'', Göttingen: Wallstein 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; it has been supported by others such as the archaeologist [[Fida Hassnain]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tombofjesus.com/index.php/en/researchers-authors/dr-fida-hassnain&lt;/ref&gt; and the writer [[Holger Kersten]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tombofjesus.com/index.php/en/researchers-authors/holger-kersten The Tomb of Jesus Christ&lt;/ref&gt;

====Publications====
Ahmadis have published extensively on the topic of Jesus' natural death and have expanded on Ghulam Ahmad's work in light of newer research.&lt;ref&gt;Jesus: A Humble Prophet of God https://www.alislam.org/topics/jesus/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Review of Religions, May 2015, Vol. 110, issue 5 http://reviewofreligions.org/date/2015/05/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.reviewofreligions.org/6107/the-lost-tribes-of-israel-in-india-a-genetic-perspective/|title=The Lost Tribes of Israel in India – A Genetic Perspective |website=|publisher=[[The Review of Religions]] (CAL)|date=March 2012|accessdate=2014-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, [[Mirza Nasir Ahmad]], the third [[Khalifatul Masih|Khalifa]], travelled to [[London]] where the international conference of Jesus’ ''Deliverance from the cross'' was held at the Commonwealth Institute in [[Kensington]]. This was attended by a number of scholars and academics who presented papers discussing the circumstances surrounding the Crucifixion of Jesus, after which the Ahmadiyya viewpoint regarding the death of Jesus was presented.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFKNVZjY8_Q 1978 Visit of Hazrat Mirza Nasir Ahmad to England and Deliverance from The Cross Conference&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://reviewofreligions.org/1964/conference-on-deliverance-from-the-cross/ The Review of Religions, March 2008, Vol. 103, issue 03, © islamic publications 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Nasir Ahmad also gave a lecture dealing with the  subject of Jesus’ survival from death upon the cross, his travel to the east, the Unity of God and the status of [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alislam.org/library/history/ahmadiyya/92.html|title=Conference in London - Islam Ahmadiyya|publisher=|accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the possibility of Roza Bal being Jesus' tomb was discussed in a BBC documentary by [[Richard Denton (producer)|Richard Denton]], ''Did Jesus Die?''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uclu.org/whats-on/clubs-societies/jesus-in-india-bbc-documentary-film-screening|title=Jesus In India: BBC Documentary Film Screening|publisher=|accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus' possible travels to India are also discussed in the 2008 documentary ''Jesus in India''  by [[Paul Davids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/paul-davids/jesus-lost-years-may-fina_b_179513.html|title=Jesus' Lost Years May Finally Have Been Found|first=Paul|last=Davids|date=26 April 2009|publisher=|accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jesus-in-india-the-movie.com/html/themovie.html|title=Jesus in India - The Movie|publisher=|accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jesus on the Cross, survival, journey to Kashmir and death==

===Death of Jesus===
{{main|Crucifixion of Jesus}}

====Biblical accounts====
Ahmadis also illustrate the notion of Jesus having survived the Crucifixion through Biblical analysis.&lt;ref name="Jesus in India"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alislam.org/topics/jesus/|title=Jesus in India - Tomb of Jesus - Where Did Jesus Die - Jesus in Islam - Al Islam Online|publisher=|accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
# Jesus had prophesied that his fate would be like that of [[Jonah]] (the story of Jonah is one of survival).{{Bibleref2c|Matt|12:40}}
# Jesus was placed on the cross for only a few hours. Death by crucifixion usually takes several days. While he was on the cross his legs were left intact, and not broken as was the normal procedure. This would have prevented death by respiratory distress. As blood and water were reported to have '[[blood gush|gushed]]' from the spear wound, this was sign of a beating heart.
# Jesus prayed to be rescued from death on the cross. {{Bibleref2c|Matt|21:22}}
# Pilate, having sympathy for Jesus, secretly devised to save him by setting his Crucifixion shortly before [[Shabbat|Sabbath day]].
# The Gospel of John records that Nicodemus brought myrrh and aloes {{Bibleref2c|John|19:39}}. These healing plants, particularly aloe plants, are considered medicinal and applied to wounds. It would make little sense applying them to a dead body. 
#According to the Bible “He that is hanged is accursed of God.” {{Bibleref2c|Deut|21:23}}; something [[Paul of Tarsus]] imputed to Jesus.{{Bibleref2c|Gal|3:13}} However, since the word "curse" would signify a satanic connection, divine antipathy and displeasure, spiritual impurity, faithlessness and disobedience to God; Jesus' being from God and the beloved of God, does not allow for him to have become accursed at any moment and therefore for him to have died on a cross.
# After he had awoken from his swoon ("[[resurrection]]"), Jesus bared his wounds to Thomas {{Bibleref2c|John|20:25-27}}, showing he did not have a supernatural, resurrected body, but a wounded human body. He was also seen in the flesh by a large number of his followers, baring the same wounds that he had suffered from his ordeal on the Cross. {{Bibleref2c|Luke|24:38-39}}
# After his wounds had sufficiently healed Jesus left the tomb and met some of his disciples and had his food with them and walked from Jerusalem to Galilee. {{Bibleref2c|Luke|24:50}}
# In his post-crucifixion appearances, Jesus left the tomb in the darkness of night {{Bibleref2c|John|20:1}}; he appears to have been moving away from the source of danger{{Bibleref2c|Luke|24:28-29}}; he showed himself only to his disciples, people whom he trusted and not the general public{{Bibleref2c|John|14:22}}; and met them under the cover of darkness at night{{Bibleref2c|John|20:19}}. This behaviour is uncharacteristic of one who had just miraculously succeeded in defying death at the hands of his enemies, having been given a new eternal life with an immortal physical body, and is more consistent with one who had just survived it and was avoiding their (that is both the government agencies and the public) notice lest he be recaptured. 
# Jesus stated that he was sent only for the "lost sheep of the house of Israel"{{Bibleref2c|Matthew|15:24}} and prophesied that he would go to seek out the Lost Ten Tribes of Israel (residing beyond the Palestine region) {{Bibleref2c|John|10:16}}. The Jews of Jesus's time believed that the [[Lost Tribes of Israel]] had become dispersed in different lands. {{Bibleref2c|John|7:34-35}} 
# When Joseph requested Jesus' body from the cross {{Bibleref2c|Mark|15:43}}, Pilate asked a centurion if Jesus was already dead {{Bibleref2c|Mark|15:44}}.  The centurion confirmed that Jesus was already dead {{Bibleref2c|Mark|15:45}}.  This centurion was a believer that Jesus was the son of God {{Bibleref2c|Mark|15:39}}.
# There are no accounts in the gospel of Jesus ascending into the heavens, aside from accounts that were absent from the earliest written gospels.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After surviving crucifixion, Jesus fled to Galilee. Jesus (along with several disciples) later left Palestine to further preach the Gospel to the Lost Tribes of Israel {{Bibleref2c|John|10:16}} &amp;ndash; that had scattered as far as [[Afghanistan]] and northern India. He eventually settled in Kashmir where he was given the name Yuz Asaf (meaning “Leader of the Healed”/"Son of Joseph").{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

===Quranic accounts===
{{Main|Jesus in Islam|Islamic view of Jesus' death}}
Ahmadiyya state that there are at least 30 verses of the Qur'an that suggest that Jesus did not ascend to Heaven but instead died a natural death on Earth. The verses in Chapter Al-Nisa (4:157-158) indicate that Jesus did not die on the Cross but that God had “raised” Jesus unto Himself (not into heaven).

{{quotation|
[4:157] And their saying, ‘We did kill the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, the
Messenger of Allah;’ whereas they slew him not, nor crucified him, but he was
made to appear to them like one crucified; and those who differ therein are
certainly in a state of doubt about it; they have no definite
knowledge thereof, but only follow a conjecture; and they
did not convert this conjecture
into a certainty;}}

{{quotation|
[4:158] On the contrary, Allah raised him to Himself. And Allah is Mighty, Wise.
}}

As the Quran speaks of God being Omnipresent in the Earth and in the hearts of mankind, God's existence is not to be misconstrued as being confined to the Heavens alone, making any bodily movement ''towards'' God impossible.&lt;ref name="Jesus in India"/&gt;

Thus Ahmadis interpret the Arabic word for raised in these verses to mean “exalted”. In other words, Jesus' spiritual rank and status was raised to come closer to God as opposed to dying the accursed death which his adversaries had wished for.

To further support the view of Jesus having died a mortal death, Ahmadis interpret the verse in the Quran 5:75:

{{quotation|
[5:76] The Messiah, son of Mary, was only a Messenger; surely Messengers the like unto him had passed away before him. And his mother was a truthful woman. They both used to eat food. See how We explain the Signs for their good, and see how they are turned away.
}}

In this verse Jesus is compared to the previous Messengers, all of which had died a natural death and none of whom had ascended bodily to Heaven.

From the following verse in Al-Imran, the Quran clarifies that all messengers before the Prophet Muhammad had died:

{{quotation|
[3:145] And Muhammad is only a Messenger. Verily, all Messengers have passed away before him. If then he die or be slain, will you turn back on your heels?...
}}

This verse pertains that all previous prophets including Jesus had died.

===Hadith accounts=== 
[[Ahmadi]] scholars have provided references citing hadith regarding the death of [[Jesus]].
{{quotation|If Jesus and Moses had been alive, they would have had no choice but to follow me. 
[Kathir vol II, p 245 and al yawaqit wal Jawahir, part 2, page 24]}} 

{{quotation|Jesus son of Mary lived for 120 years, and I see myself as only entering upon the beginning of the sixties. 
[Kanz al Ummal, part 6, p.120]}}


As [[Muhammad]] has lived and died after some 60 years, it means that Jesus is also dead. As Muhammad is dead, this states that there likewise was a death of Jesus.
During the [[Mi'raj]], Muhammad had seen Jesus in the second heaven along with [[John the Baptist]]. Thus, it means Jesus is dead because the dead do not dwell amongst the living.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Death of Jesus according Hadith|url=http://www.alislam.org/library/links/Jesus_death/3_Hadith.html|publisher=Al Islam|accessdate=16 March 2012|date=2000-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second Coming of Jesus==
{{Main|Second Coming}}
The Hadith and the Bible indicate that Jesus will return during the latter days. Islamic Hadith commonly depicts that Jesus, upon his second coming, would be an "Ummati" (Muslim) and a follower of Muhammad and that he would revive the truth of Islam rather than fostering a new religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/abudawud/037.sat.html#037.4310|title=Sunan Abi Dawud, Kitab Al-Malahim, Book 37, Number 4310|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Similarities to Jesus===
The movement interprets the prophecised [[Second Coming]] of Jesus as being of a person "similar to Jesus" (''mathīl-i ʿIsā''), rather than that of Jesus of Nazareth himself. Mirza Ghulam Ahmad professed that the prophecy in traditional religious texts were greatly misunderstood to interpret that Jesus of Nazareth himself would return.

Ahmadis consider that [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad|the founder of the movement]], in both his teachings and character as well as his situation and struggles, was representative of Jesus.

Henceforth, Ahmadis believe this prediction &amp;ndash; the Second Coming &amp;ndash; was fulfilled by Ahmad and continued by his movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alislam.org/library/books/promisedmessiah/index.htm?page=63 “A Prophet Like Unto Moses”], The Promised Mehdi and Messiha, by Dr. Aziz Ahmad Chaudhry, Islam International Publications Limited&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="muslim.org"&gt;[http://www.muslim.org/bookspdf/fourques.pdf The Four Questions Answered], by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, AAIIL 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

====Universal Prophethood====
The Ahmadiyya movement assert the expected arrival of a Latter Day [[Messiah]] is historically represented across all major faiths. The prophecy regarding a latter day messiah had diverged into separate theories and distinct interpretations and this filtered through to different religious movements. This prophecy nonetheless was originally only intended to refer to a single Messiah. As such, Ahmadis declared that the Messiah concerning all major world faiths has been unified by the advent of a single Promised Messiah (Ghulam Ahmad).  
 
Ahmadi's believe that all world faiths will gradually move towards Ahmadiyya; and that such a process will follow a correlative pattern of circumstances and take a similar amount of time to what it took for Christianity to rise to dominance (roughly 300 years).&lt;ref&gt;The third century from today would not have elapsed when all who wait for ‘Isaas [Jesus] to descend from heaven, whether Muslims or Christians, will give up this doctrine in hopeless despair and disgust. Then there will be only one religion and one leader. I have come to sow the seed and the seed has been sown by my hand. It will now grow and flourish and there is no one who can hinder it.
[Tadhkiratush-Shahadatain, pp. 64–65, Ruhani Khaza’in, vol. 20, pp. 66–67; Review of Religions, vol. 2, no. 11, 12, November, December, 1903, p. 455, 456]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contention with Mainstream Islamic beliefs==

The [[Encyclopedia of Islam]] states that the post-crucifixion journey of Jesus towards the East and his natural death as an aspect of Ahmadi belief is one of three primary tenets that distinguish Ahmadi teachings from general Islamic ones, and that it has provoked a ''[[fatwa]]'' against the movement.&lt;ref name="EI"/&gt;

The claim that Mirza Ghulam was a prophet forms a point of contention with mainstream Islam, as it views this as a contradiction to the Quranic and Hadith teachings of Muhammad. Contemporary Islamic scholars view the Ahmadiyya belief as a contradiction with a verse in the Quran,  Chapter 33 (The Combined Forces), verse 40:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Muhammad is not the father of [any] one of your men, but [he is] the Messenger of Allah and Seal of the prophets. And ever is Allah, of all things, Knowing."   
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Further, in the  farewell sermon of the Prophet Muhammad, delivered just prior to his death, he warned his followers and all of mankind with the following message:  
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"O People! No Prophet or apostle will come after me and no new faith will be born. Reason well, therefore O People! and understand words that I convey to you. I leave behind me two things, the Qur'an and the Sunnah and if you follow these you will never go astray."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ahmadis believe however, in accordance with the Hadith traditions, that the "Last" of the Prophets is meant to signify the "Very Best" and "Most Exalted Law Giver Prophet" among all the Prophets and that the farewell sermon had only signified that no prophet would come immediately after the Prophet Muhammad had died.

The movement believe the interpretation of "finality" that is upheld by the mainstream Islamist view, paradoxes the Hadith concerning the second advent of Jesus altogether. For instance if Jesus is expected to return physically, as contemporary Islamic scholars uphold, it would be completely implausible considering that at the same time it is impossible for any Prophet to come after the Prophet Muhammed.

The Hadith indicated when the Prophet Muhammad had declared himself as the Last of the Prophets, with the same breath he had also declared his mosque as the Last of the mosque.

{{quotation|
Ayesha narrated that the Prophet (Allah's prayer and salvation be upon him) said : 
 " I am the last of the Prophet and my mosque is the last of the mosques of the Prophets. The most rightful of the mosque that may be visited and for which the vigours of the journey may be borne are the Masjid Haram and my mosque; and a Salah in my mosque is more excellent than a salah in any other mosque by one thousand times, except the Masjid Haram."

(Reported by al-Bazzar and authenticated by Sheikh Albani in Sahih Targhib No. 1175) 
}}

This Hadith implicates the view of Muhammad as being the "Last" in the absolute sense. If the Prophet Muhammad declared his mosque being Last of the mosques then by the same interpretation this would have effectively invalidated all other mosques. But this Hadith also mentions that "the last of the mosques of the Prophets", which is known as Masjid - e - Nabawi, the Prophet Muhammad lived there and is also buried there. But this hadith does not show "last of the mosques" rather it shows "last of the mosques of the Prophets". Ahmadiyyah are decepted because of wrong interpretation of Hadith.

The Ahmadiyya understanding of the term [[Khatam an-Nabiyyin|''Seal of Prophets'']] with reference to [[Muhammad]], establishes that a prophet cannot come after Muhammad from outside the [[Ummah|Islamic dispensation]]. Nor can one whose prophethood is independent of Muhammad. Jesus' ministry, according to the Quran, was limited to the Israelites&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|3|49|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|61|06|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|43|59|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; and since he received his prophecy independently of Muhammad, his physical return after the advent of Muhammad, (as contemporary Muslims expect) violates the Seal of Prophethood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=MdRth02Q6nAC&amp;pg=PA134&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=Islam and the Ahmadiyya Jama'at: History, Belief, Practice| accessdate=22 September 2015| isbn=9781850659167| year=2008| last1=Valentine| first1=Simon Ross}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.alislam.org/books/truth/finality.html | title= Finality of Prophethood| accessdate=22 September 2015}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consensus of Companions of Muhammad on Jesus' death===
Ahmadi scholars profess that when Prophet Muhammad died, the [[Sahaba]] were grieved. [[Umar]], angered and upset, took out a sword, and said that he would kill anyone who said Muhammad is dead. At this instance [[Abu Bakar]] quoted:
{{Quote|[3:144] And Muhammad is but a messenger; the messengers passed away before him; if then he dies or is killed will you turn back upon your heels? And whoever turns back upon his heels, he will by no means do harm to Allah in the least and Allah will reward the grateful."}}

The Ahmadiyya sect believes that because no companion said [[Jesus]] is alive in heaven and he would come physically in [[Second Coming]], the implication invariably is that Jesus died a natural death (and not on the Cross).

==Fulfilment of Messianic prophecies==

Mirza Ghulam Ahmad regarded the prophecies and concepts in Hadith and bible concerning his advent in an entirely metaphorical light. For example, he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The second special aspect of the prophecy, which relates to the advent of the Promised Messiah, is that he will break the cross, slaughter the swine and kill the one-eyed Antichrist. Every disbeliever who is touched by his breath will die instantly. The spiritual interpretation of this special aspect is that the Promised Messiah will crush under his feet all the glory of the religion of the cross, that he will destroy with the weapon of conclusive arguments those who are afflicted with shamelessness like swine, and who devour filth like pigs, and that he will wipe out with the sword of clear proofs the opposition of those who possess only the eye of the world and are bereft of the eye of the faith in place of which they have only an unsightly taint. Not only such one-eyed ones, but also every disbeliever who views Islam with contempt will suffer spiritual extinction through the glorious breath of Messianic reasoning. In short all these signs are metaphoric, the significance of which has been fully revealed to me. Some may not appreciate it at this time but after waiting for sometime, and despairing altogether of the hopes that they now entertain, all of them will accept it.” (Izala-e-Auham, Volume 3, Pages 141-143)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Breaking of the Cross===
The Islamic Hadith describe that Jesus would, upon his second coming, "Break the Cross". Ahmadis interpret this to mean that he will "make plain the error of the creed of the cross". Ghulam Ahmad's teachings of Jesus, being a mortal man who survived crucifixion and died a natural death upon earth, is considered as a testimony of the prophecy being fulfilled. Ahmadi's believe the followers of Christianity will gradually come to accept the same teaching and this will repeal the central doctrines of the divinity of Jesus, [[Atonement in Christianity|Atonement]]  and [[resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]]. In turn, the traditional Christian reverence for the cross and doctrine of the immortality of Jesus will become untenable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alislam.org/library/books/jesus-in-india/ch4.html |title=Jesus in India |publisher=Alislam.org |date= |accessdate=2012-12-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121004856/http://www.alislam.org/library/books/jesus-in-india/ch4.html |archivedate=2013-01-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ending of wars===
{{main|Ahmadiyya view on Jihad}}

In 1894, Ghulam Ahmad had declared that the contemporary Islamists views of Jihad of the sword and Holy War was a misrepresentation of Islam that was invented during the Dark Ages and advocated for these beliefs to be ended in its entirety. The Ahmadiyya Movement contend that any military jihad in Islam is permitted only as an exclusively ''religious'' defensive measure in very strictly defined circumstances and those circumstances do not exist at present. As a result, early Ahmadis had faced virulent opposition from extremist groups, some of whom protested that Ghulam Ahmad was put in place by the British Government to appease Muslims. Ahmadis believe that in the modern era, the "Jihad of the pen" (intellectual reasoning) is the only potent way of espousing and spreading the Islamic teaching and this has taken the place of "Jihad of the sword" as per scriptural prophecies. 
As such the movement consider the prophecies in the Hadith relating to ending of religious wars had been fulfilled by Ghulam Ahmad teachings.

==Journey from Palestine to India==
{{main|Jesus in India (book)|Lost years of Jesus|Christianity in India|Thomas the Apostle|Mary Magdalene}}
According to Ghulam Ahmad, (and further developed by the next generation of Ahmadi writers such as [[Khwaja Nazir Ahmad]] in 1952), Jesus taught the message of [[Jewish messianism]] to his disciples and to the people living in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. 
After surviving his ordeal on the cross, Jesus remained in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] for a short time before leaving from there. Jesus was declared a criminal and therefore, decided to leave Palestine with his mother [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], his wife [[Mary Magdalene]] and his apostle [[Thomas the Apostle]]. Thereafter, Jesus traveled toward Asia.

===From Palestine to Iraq===
{{main|Iraqi Jews|Christianity in Iraq}}
With these three companions, he went first to [[Iraq]]. Here he met his disciple, [[Ananias of Damascus|Ananias]]. He met his rival [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] who later became a [[Christian]].  In [[Nusaybin]], he got another tension at the hands of a cruel king. He was arrested again. Prophet Jesus along with his mother performed some miracles and impressed the king. The king gave him permission to go to [[Parthia]] kingdom. There was a strong [[Jewish]] community living there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Post Cruxification|url=http://www.alislam.org/library/books/Deliverance-from-the-Cross-20080607MN.pdf|publisher=Islam International Publications|accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Journey to India|url=http://tombofjesus.com/en/travel-to-india|publisher=Tomb of Jesus|accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iraq to Iran and Afghanistan===
{{main|Persian Jews||Yehud Medinata|Jews in Afghanistan|Theory of Pashtun descent from Israelites|Christianity in Iran|Christianity in Afghanistan}}
From Iraq, he went to [[Iran]] where he was honourably received by the [[Persian Jews]]. Five centuries before [[Cyrus the Great]] had conquered [[Babylon]] and the [[Jews]] were freed. Many of the Jews went to live in [[Iran]] and were known as [[Persian Jews]]. Jesus preached here and went on to Bactria ([[Afghanistan]]). At that time, Persia was a great center of [[Judaism]]. He professed the advent of the coming of a great prophet named [[Muhammad]] to his fellowmen in these areas specially in the area of [[Afghanistan]]. He met with the first king of [[Parthia]] who honored him. The [[Pashtun people]] have a tradition in their royal and non-royal functions and consider themselves to be the sons of [[Children of Israel]]. Many of these Persian   [[Jews]] who had been receiving the teachings from [[Jesus]] proselytized to Muslims at the time of [[Muhammad]] and accepted his call. [[Qais Abdur Rashid]], his name is this and the original was [[Kish (Bible)|Kish]].

===Reasons for coming to India===
{{main|Tribes of Israel|Jews in India|Bene Israel|Theory of Kashmiri descent from lost tribes of Israel}}
According to Ahmadiyya sources (Islam International Publications Ltd.) the [[Tribes of Israel]] who had migrated to eastern countries seeing the attraction in [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] had themselves become [[Hindus]] and [[Buddhists]]. They subsequently became unaware of their religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=2003|publisher=Islam International Publications Limited|location=United Kingdom|isbn=978-1853726255|page=93|url=http://www.alislam.org/library/books/TrueStory-of-Jesus.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Jesus]] and [[Thomas the Apostle]] had later arrived in India to restore the abrahamic teachings to these tribes.

===Jesus Meets King Shalewhin===
According to a late section of the [[Hindu]] ''[[Bhavishya Purana]]'' (written after 1739&lt;ref&gt;[[Alf Hiltebeitel]] Rethinking India's Oral and Classical Epics 2009 Page 276 "Thus 1739 could mark a terminus a quo for the text's history of the Mughals. If so, the same terminus would apply to its Genesis-Exodus sequence in its first khanda, its Jesus-Muhammad diptych in its third (the Krsnam&amp;acaritd), and the history ..."&lt;/ref&gt;). 
[[Jesus Christ]] met a Hindu monarch, [[King Shalivahan]].

The king along with his companions went to the peak of [[Himalayas]] to meet a man who was a dignified person of fair complexion in white clothes sitting in the mountain. When the king asked who he was, the man replied "I am the Messiah, born of a virgin."

He told the king he had come from a far off place where he has suffered at the hands of his people. When the king asked what religion he adhered to, he said that his religion was of peace, love and purity of heart. The king was impressed, so he paid homage to him.&lt;ref name="alislam" /&gt;

==Tomb of Jesus==
{{main|Roza Bal}}

During his initial research into Jesus' death, [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]] postulated that Jesus may have been buried in either Galilee or Syria. After investigating further he eventuality uncovered evidence to conclude that the tomb of Jesus was located at the [[Roza Bal]] shrine in Srinagar, Kashmir. Based upon this evidence, Ahmadis today believe the tomb of Jesus is located in the [[Srinagar]] region of Kashmir.

Ghulam Ahmad, and later Ahmadi writers cite various evidences for identifying the grave as that of Jesus: The [[Bhavishya Maha Purana]] Official Decree, The [[Glass Mirror]], [[Tarikh-i-Kashmir]], [[Qisa-shazada]], The Garden of Solomon (Bagh-i-Sulaiman) of [[Mir Saadullah Shahabadi Kashmiri]] (1780 A.D.), [[Wajeesut Tawarikh]], [[Ikmal-ud-Din]] (962 AD), The [[Ain-ul-Hayat]], The [[Acta Thomae]], [[Takhat Sulaiman]] (Throne of Solomon, a hill in Kashmir), [[Tahrik-i-kabir-Kashmir]], [[Rauzat-us-Safa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arifkhan.co.uk/TOJ/core/historical_sources/index.html Arifkhan.co.uk "Historical Sources" New Ahmadi website] redirecting from tombofjesus.com in earlier article references&lt;/ref&gt; Ahmadis believe that these sources testify to the view that Yuz Asaf and Jesus are the same person.

[[Haji Mohi-ud-din Miskin]], writing in 1902, three years after Mirza Ghulam Ahmad in 1899, is the first historian to mention that "some" connect the shrine of [[Yuzasaf]] as the grave of Hazrat Isa Rooh-Allah (Jesus the Spirit of God).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tombofjesus.com/2007/core/historical_sources/docs/tahrik_kashmir.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The importance of the shrine has been preserved in the memory of the descendants of the ancient Israelites to this day. They call the shrine "The tomb of Hazrat Issa Sahib", "The Tomb of Lord Jesus".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tombofjesus.com/2007/core/historical_sources/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The building constructed is named "Roza Bal" or "Rauza Bal". " [[Rauza]] " is generally a term used to denote the tomb of a celebrated personality, i.e. noble, wealthy, or saintly. A local scholar and supporter of the theory, [[Fida Hassnain]], has claimed that the tomb is arranged with the feet pointing in the direction of Jerusalem, and claimed that this is in accordance with Jewish tradition.

Ahmadis give the Yuz Asaf enshrined in the tomb the epithet ''Shahzada Nabi'', “Prophet Prince”. The majority Srinagar Sunni Muslim community reject the Ahmadiyya claims that the tomb is that of Jesus and consider this viewpoint as blasphemous.

===Tomb of Mary===
The Ahmadis also believe&lt;ref name="Faruqi_1983_98"/&gt; that [[Mary in Islam|Mary]] had accompanied her son on the journey to Kashmir.

Muslim and Persian documents — the Tafir-Ibn-I-Jarir, the Kanz-al-Ummal, and the Rauzat-us-Safa — have references that contribute to the theory of Jesus' escape. Some of these also mention that Jesus was accompanied by Mary, and there is another burial place in Pakistan, along his theoretical route to Kashmir, known as [[Murree|Mai Mari da Ashtan]], or "resting place of Mother Mary."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://travel.news.yahoo.com/b/rba_daily/rba_daily4337;_ylt=Aqwkw5JnBWPG5mKEouQ1tbuhO84F;_ylu=X3oDMTBhdTdkN3BoBHNlYwNibHRyaXA-|title=Mystery of the Martyr's Tomb: Part Two|publisher=|accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://bigthink.com/strange-maps/124-jesus-in-india-a-road-map-of-his-lost-years&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John J. McNeill''' (September 2, 1925 – September 22, 2015) was ordained as a [[Jesuit]] [[priest]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/09/02/archives/vatican-silences-priest-who-urged-church-ease-view-on-homosexuals.html|title=Vatican Silences Priest Who Urged Church Ease View|last=Briggs|first=Kenneth A.|date=September 2, 1977|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|page=34|accessdate=4 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1959 and subsequently worked as a psychotherapist and an academic theologian, with a particular reputation within the field of [[Queer Theology]].

==Career==

Born in Buffalo in 1925,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/26/nyregion/john-mcneill-priest-who-pushed-catholic-church-to-welcome-gays-dies-at-90.html?_r=0|title=John McNeill : Priest Who Pushed cAtholic Church to Welcome Gays Dies at 90|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; McNeill grew up in up-state New York. He served during World War II, but was captured and transported to a German prisoner-of-war camp near Leukenwald. This had an effect on his spirituality and in 1948 he entered the Society of Jesus; finally being ordained a Jesuit priest in 1959 by [[Cardinal Spellman]] of New York.&lt;ref name="miamiherald.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/gay-south-florida/article36352038.html|title=The Rev. John J. McNeill, Jesuit priest who became famed LGBT activist, dies at 90|work=Miamiherald|accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He obtained a [[Ph.D.]] from the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|Catholic University of Leuven]] in Belgium in 1964. It was there that he fell in love with a man, later saying: ''"The experience of the joy and peace that comes with that — it was a clear indication to me that homosexual love was in itself a good love and could be a holy love"''. He went on to teach at [[LeMoyne College]] in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], NY and [[Fordham University]] in NYC. In 1972, he joined the combined Woodstock Jesuit Seminary and [[Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York|Union Theological Seminary]] faculty as professor of [[Christian Ethics]], specializing in [[Sexual Ethics]]. He was a noted peace advocate during the [[Vietnam War]].

In 1969 he played a part in the establishment of [[DignityUSA]], an organization functioning both as a support and social group for LGBT and LGBT-accepting Catholics to worship together - founding a chapter in New York in 1972.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rev-dr-nancy-wilson/catholics-lose-pioneer-ga_b_8189740.html|title=Catholics Lose Pioneer Gay Leader: Will Pope Francis Express Grief for Fellow Jesuit?|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John J. McNeill - The Church and the homosexual.jpeg|thumbnail|left|McNeill published his seminal work, "''The Church and the Homosexual''" in 1976]]

In 1976, McNeill published ''[[The Church and the Homosexual]]'', which challenged the Church's prohibition of [[Homosexuality and Roman Catholicism|same-sex activity]]. It was the first extended non-judgmental work about gay Catholics, a subject that had long been taboo in official church discourse. The book was the first attempt by a reputed scholar and theologian to examine and challenge traditional church teachings on sexuality and attitudes toward gay and lesbian Catholics. It argued for a change in Church teaching and that homosexual relationships should be judged by the same standard of heterosexual ones. It argued that a stable, loving same-sex relationship was just as moral, and just as godly, as a heterosexual one and should be acknowledged as such by church leaders. It has been credited with helping to set in motion the re-evaluation of the religious stance toward gay people.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/26/nyregion/john-mcneill-priest-who-pushed-catholic-church-to-welcome-gays-dies-at-90.html&lt;/ref&gt;

After an extensive review of the manuscript by a panel of theologians, the work received permission from McNeill's Jesuit superiors prior to printing and the Vatican [[imprimatur]]. It was translated into several languages. However, the following year the permission was retracted at the order of the Vatican, and McNeill was ordered by Cardinal [[Joseph Ratzinger]] not to write or speak further publicly about the issue of homosexuality. McNeill responded in a statement highlighting his concern that "''gay men most likely to act out their sexual needs in an unsafe, compulsive way, and therefore expose themselves to the HIV virus, are precisely those who have internalised the self-hatred that their religions impose on them.''" He nevertheless observed the imposed silence for nine years while continuing his private ministry to gays and lesbian Catholics.&lt;ref name="ncronline.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ncronline.org/news/people/patron-saint-lgbt-catholics-john-j-mcneill-90-dies|title=‘Patron saint’ of LGBT Catholics, John J. McNeill, 90, dies|work=Ncronline.org|accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two things eventually led him to speak out. Firstly, seeing the devastating effects of the [[AIDS]] epidemic after establishing an AIDS ministry alongside [[Mychal Judge]], serving homeless people in Harlem. Secondly, the 1986 Vatican pastoral letter, "[[On the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons]]" issued by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger. The document declared that homosexuality was "a more or less strong tendency ordered toward an intrinsic moral evil." McNeill condemned the letter in a statement issued to [[The New York Times]] and The [[National Catholic Reporter]].&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

In 1987, he received yet another order from Ratzinger directing him to give up all ministry to gay persons and remain silent on gay issues or face expulsion. An order, he said, he could not follow in good conscience. He was subsequently expelled from the Jesuit order after 40 years.&lt;ref name="ncronline.org"/&gt; He remained nominally a priest but was not permitted to say Mass.

Nevertheless, McNeill remained respected among gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender rights Catholics as well as others who looked to his scholarly writings to help them accept their own sexuality and defend themselves against what they viewed to be misguided church teachings. In 1987, he was the grand marshal of the New York City gay pride parade.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; He continued to speak out against official Catholic teachings on matters of sexuality and in particular the harsh and "homophobic" teachings coming out of the Vatican.&lt;ref name="ncronline.org"/&gt; McNeill himself was openly gay&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

In 1998 he published his memoir, "Both Feet Firmly Planted in Midair: My Spiritual Journey." In 2012, a documentary entitled 'Taking A Chance On God' was directed and produced by Brendan Fay about his life. He spoke about having tried "with the help of the Holy Spirit to free gay Christians from the lies of a pathologically homophobic religion."&lt;ref name="miamiherald.com"/&gt;

McNeill died at a hospice in [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]] on September 22, 2015 at the age of 90 with his partner of 46 years, Charlie Chiarelli, at his bedside. The two men married in Toronto in 2008.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ncronline.org"/&gt;

{{main|History of Roman Catholicism in Japan|Christianity in Japan}}
The Japanese term {{Nihongo|'''''Kirishitan'''''|吉利支丹, 切支丹, キリシタン, きりしたん}}, from [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''cristão'' (cf. [[Kristang language|Kristang]]), referred to [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Christian]]s in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and is used in Japanese texts as a historiographic term for Roman Catholics in [[Japan]] in the 16th and 17th centuries.

Modern Japanese has several ways of spelling Christian of which the most common are the noun form ''kirisuto-kyōto'' [[:wikt:キリスト教徒|キリスト教徒]], and also ''kurisuchan'' [[:wikt:クリスチャン|クリスチャン]]. The Japanese spelling ''kirishitan'' [[:wikt:キリシタン|キリシタン]] is used primarily in Japanese texts for the early [[history of Roman Catholicism in Japan]], or in relation to ''[[Kakure Kirishitan|kakure kirishitan]]'', Hidden Christians. However, English sources on histories of Japan generally use the term "Christian" without distinction.

==History==
Christian missionaries were known as ''bateren'' (from the Portuguese word ''padre'', "father")&lt;ref name="Jansen, page 67"&gt;[[#Jansen|Jansen]], p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; or ''iruman'' (from the Portuguese ''irmão'', "brother"). Both the transcriptions 切支丹 and 鬼利死丹 came into use during the Edo Period when Christianity was a forbidden religion. The Kanji used for the transcriptions have negative connotations. The first one could be read as "cut off support", and the second as "devils who profit from death".

Portuguese ships began arriving in Japan in 1543,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Documentos|Documentos de Japon]]&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Catholic]] missionary activities in Japan beginning in earnest around 1549, mainly by [[Portugal|Portuguese]]-sponsored [[Jesuits]] until [[Spain|Spanish]]-sponsored [[mendicant]] orders, such as the [[Franciscans]] and [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]], gained access to Japan. Of the 95 Jesuits who worked in Japan up to 1600, 57 were Portuguese, 20 were Spaniards and 18 Italian.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cultural-Int|Cultural Interactions]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francis Xavier]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#CathEnXavier|Catholic Encyclopedia, Xavier entry]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#CathForum|Catholic Forum]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cosme de Torres]] (a Jesuit priest), and [[Juan Fernández (missionary)|João Fernandes]] were the first to arrive to [[Kagoshima]] with hopes to bring Christianity and Catholicism to Japan. At its height, Japan is estimated to have had around 300,000 Christians.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Jansen|Jansen]], page 77&lt;/ref&gt; Catholicism was subsequently repressed in several parts of the country and ceased to exist publicly in the 17th century.

== Line of demarcations between Portugal and Spain ==
[[Image:CelebratingAChristianMassInJapan.jpg|thumb|left|Celebrating a Christian mass in Japan.]]
Religion was an integral part of the state and evangelization was seen as having both secular and spiritual benefits for both [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]]. Indeed, [[Pope Alexander VI]]'s [[Bulls of Donation]] (1493) commanded the [[Catholic Monarchs]] to take such steps. Wherever Spain and Portugal attempted to expand their territories or influence, missionaries would soon follow. By the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] (1494), the two powers divided the world between them into exclusive spheres of influence, trade and colonization.  Although, at the time of the demarcation, neither nation had any direct contact with Japan, that nation fell into the sphere of the Portuguese.

The countries disputed the attribution of Japan. Since neither could colonize it, the exclusive right to propagate Christianity in Japan meant the exclusive right to trade with Japan. Portuguese-sponsored Jesuits under [[Alessandro Valignano]] took the lead in proselytizing in Japan over the objection of the Spaniards, starting in 1579. The fait accompli was approved in [[Pope Gregory XIII]]'s [[papal bull]] of 1575, which decided that Japan belonged to the Portuguese [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Macau|Diocese of Macau]]. In 1588, the diocese of Funai ([[Nagasaki]]) was founded under Portuguese protection.

In rivalry with the Jesuits, Spanish-sponsored [[mendicant orders]] entered into Japan via [[Manila]]. While criticizing Jesuit activities, they actively lobbied the Pope. Their campaigns resulted in [[Pope Clement VIII]]'s decree of 1600, which allowed Spanish [[friars]] to enter Japan via the Portuguese Indies, and [[Pope Paul V]]'s decree of 1608, which abolished the restrictions on the route. The Portuguese accused Spanish Jesuits of working for their homeland instead of their patron. The power struggle between Jesuits and mendicant orders caused a [[schism (religion)|schism]] within the diocese of Funai. Furthermore, mendicant orders tried in vain to establish a diocese on the [[Tōhoku region]] that was to be independent from the Portuguese one.

The Roman Catholic world order was challenged by the Netherlands and England. Theoretically, it was repudiated by [[Grotius]]'s ''Mare Liberum''. In the early 17th century, Japan built trade relations with the Netherlands and England. Although England withdrew from the operations in ten years under [[James I of England|James I]] due to lack of profitability, the Netherlands continued to trade with Japan and became the only European country that maintained trade relations with Japan until the 19th century. As trade competitors, the Protestant countries engaged in a negative campaign against Catholicism, and it subsequently affected [[shogunate]] policies toward the [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] kingdoms.

Portugal's and Spain's colonial policies were also challenged by the Roman Catholic Church itself. The [[Holy See|Vatican]] founded the [[Congregatio de Propaganda Fide]] in 1622 and attempted to separate the churches from the influence of the [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] kingdoms. However, it was too late for Japan. The organization failed to establish staging points in Japan.

== Propagation strategy ==
[[File:Jesuit with Japanese nobleman circa 1600.jpg|thumb|A Jesuit with a samurai, circa 1600.]]
The Jesuits believed that it was better to seek to influence people in power and then allow the religion to be passed downwards to the commoners later.&lt;ref name="Jansen, p. 22"&gt;[[#Jansen|Jansen]], p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; They tried to avoid suspicion by not preaching to the commoners without permission from the local rulers to propagate Catholicism within their domains.&lt;ref name="Jansen, p. 22"/&gt; As a result, several ''[[daimyō]]'' became Christians, soon to be followed by many of their subjects as the Dominicans and [[Augustinians]] were able to begin preaching to the commoners.&lt;ref name="Jansen, p. 22"/&gt;  After the [[edict]] banning Christianity, there were communities that kept practicing Catholicism without having any contact with the Church until missionaries were able to return much later.

When Xavier disembarked in Kagoshima, the principal chiefs of the two branches of the Shimazu family, Sanehisa and Katsuhisa, were warring for the sovereignty of their lands. Katsuhisa adopted [[Takahisa Shimazu]] who in 1542 was accepted as head of the clan having previously received the Portuguese merchants on Tanegashima Island, learning about the use of firearms. Later, he met Xavier himself at the castle of Uchiujijo and permitted the conversion of his vassals.

[[File:Kirishitan book in Japanese 16th century.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|''Kirishitan'' book in Japanese, 16th century.]]
Having a religious background, Takahisa showed himself to be benevolent and already allowed freedom of worship but not helping the missionaries nor favoring their church. Failing to find a way to the centre of affairs, the court of the Emperor, Xavier soon tired and left to [[Yamaguchi, Yamaguchi|Yamaguchi]] thus beginning the Yamaguchi period.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lopez-Gay|St Francis Xavier and the Shimazu Family]]&lt;/ref&gt; Xavier stayed in Yamaguchi for two months on his way to an abortive audience with the Emperor in Kyoto. Yamaguchi was already a prosperous and refined city and its leaders, the [[Ōuchi family]], were aware that Xavier's journey to Japan had begun after the completion of his mission in India.

They took Catholicism for some sort of new sect of Buddhism and were curious to know of the priest's doctrine. Tolerant but shrewd, their eyes less on baptism than the Portuguese cargoes from Macao, they granted the Jesuit permission to preach. The uncompromising Xavier took to the streets of the city denouncing, among other things, infanticide, idolatry and homosexuality. Misunderstandings were inevitable.

Christian books were published in Japanese from the 1590s on, some with more than one thousand copies, and from 1601 a printing press was established under the supervision of Soin Goto Thomas, a citizen of Nagasaki, with thirty Japanese working full-time at the press. Liturgical calendars were also printed after 1592 until at least 1634. Christian solidarity made also possible missionary mail delivery throughout the country until the end of the 1620s.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

== Nature of early Christian community ==
[[Image:ChristNetsukeIvory17thcenturyJapan.jpg|thumb|[[Netsuke]] depicting Christ, 17th century, Japan.]]
Different groups of laymen supported Christian life in the Japanese mission, e.g., dōjuku, kanbō and jihiyakusha helped the clergymen in activities like the celebration of Sunday liturgy in the absence of ordained clergy, religious education, preparation of confessions, and 
spiritual support of the sick. By the end of the 16th century kanbō and jihiyakusha had similar responsibilities and also organized funerals and baptized children with permission to baptize from Rome. The kanbō were those who had left secular life but not taken formal vows, while the jihiyakusha were married and had a profession.

These groups were fundamental to the mission, and themselves depended on both the ecclesiastical hierarchy as well as the warlords who controlled the lands where they lived. Therefore, the success of the Japanese mission cannot be explained only as the result of the action of a brilliant group of missionaries, or of the commercial and political interests of a few ''[[daimyō]]s'' and traders.

At the same time the missionaries faced the hostility of many other ''daimyōs''. Christianity challenged Japanese civilization. A militant lay community, the main reason for missionary success in Japan, was also the main reason for the anti-Christian policy of the Tokugawa's bakufu.

== Economic activities ==
The Jesuits in Japan had to maintain economic self-sufficiency because they could not expect stable and sufficient payment from their patron, the King of [[Portugal]], but the king allowed the Jesuits to engage in trade with Japan. Such economic activity can be found in the work of [[Francis Xavier]], the pioneer of Catholic missions in Japan, who covered the cost of missionary work through merchant trading. From the 1550s to the 1570s, the Jesuits covered all necessary expenses with trade profits and bought land in [[India]].

Their officially recognized commercial activity was a fixed-amount entry into the Portuguese silk trade between Macau and Nagasaki. They financed to a certain amount the trade association in Macau, which purchased raw silk in Canton and sold it in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]]. They did not confine their commercial activity to the official silk market but expanded into unauthorized markets. For the Macau-Nagasaki trade, they dealt in silk fabrics, gold, musk and other goods including military supplies and slavery. Sometimes, they even got involved in Spanish trade, prohibited by the kings of [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]], and antagonizing the Portuguese traders.

It was mainly procurators who brokered Portuguese trade. They resided in Macau and Nagasaki, and accepted purchase commitments by Japanese customers such as the shogunate ''daimyō'' and wealthy merchants. By brokerage, the Jesuits could expect not only rebates but also favorable treatment from the authorities. For this reason, the office of procurator became an important post amongst the Jesuits in Japan. Although trade activities by the Jesuits ate into Portuguese trade interests, procurators continued their brokerage utilizing the authority of the Catholic Church. At the same time, Portuguese merchants required the assistance of procurators who were familiar with Japanese [[customs]], since they established no permanent trading post in Japan.  Probably the most notable procurator was [[João Rodrigues (missionary)|João Rodrigues]], who approached [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] and [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] and even participated in the administration of Nagasaki.

Such commercial activities were contrary to the idea of honorable poverty that the priests held. But some Jesuits at this time placed the expansion of the society's influence before this ideal. Mendicant orders fiercely accused the Jesuits of being corrupt and even considered their activity as the primary reason for Japan's ban on Catholicism. Mendicant orders themselves were not necessarily uninvolved in commercial activities.

== Military activities ==

Missionaries were not reluctant to take military action if they considered it an effective way to Christianize Japan. They often associated military action against Japan with the conquest of China. They thought that well-trained Japanese soldiers who had experienced long civil wars would help their countries conquer China. For example, [[Alessandro Valignano]] said to the Philippine Governor that it was impossible to conquer Japan because the Japanese were very brave and always received military training but that Japan would benefit them when they would conquer China. [[Francisco Cabral]] also reported to the King of [[Spain]] that priests were able to send to China two or three thousand Japanese Christian soldiers who were brave and were expected to serve the king with little pay.

The Jesuits provided various kinds of support including military support to Kirishitan ''daimyōs'' when they were threatened by non-Kirishitan ''daimyōs''. Most notable was their support of [[Ōmura Sumitada]] and [[Arima Harunobu]], who fought against the anti-Catholic [[Ryūzōji Takanobu|Ryuzoji]] clan. In the 1580s, Valignano believed in the effectiveness of military action and fortified Nagasaki and Mogi. In 1585, [[Gaspar Coelho]] asked the Spanish [[Philippines]] to send a fleet but the plan was rejected due to the shortness of its military capability.   Christians [[Arima Harunobu]] and [[Okamoto Daihachi incident|Paulo Okamoto]] were named as principals in an assassination plot to murder the magistrate in charge of the Shogunate's most important port city of Nagasaki.

== Early policy toward Catholicism ==
[[Image:JapaneseDelegatesAndPopeGregory13.JPG|thumb|The Japanese embassy of [[Mancio Ito]], with [[Pope Gregory XIII]] in 1585]]
When the Jesuit priest Francis Xavier arrived, Japan was experiencing a nationwide civil war. Neither the emperor nor the Ashikaga shogun could exercise power over the nation. At first, Xavier planned to gain permission for building a mission from the emperor but was disappointed with the devastation of the imperial residence. The Jesuits approached ''daimyōs'' in southwestern Japan and succeeded in converting some of these ''daimyōs''. One reason for their conversion may have been the Portuguese trade in which the Jesuits acted as brokers. The Jesuits recognized this and approached local rulers with offers of trade and exotic gifts.

The Jesuits attempted to expand their activity to [[Kyoto]] and the surrounding regions. In 1559, Gaspar Vilela obtained permission from [[Ashikaga Yoshiteru]] to teach Christianity. This license was the same as  those given to [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[temples]], so special treatment cannot be confirmed regarding the Jesuits. On the other hand, [[Emperor Ōgimachi]] issued edicts to ban Catholicism in 1565 and 1568. The orders of the Emperor and the Shogun made little difference.

Christians refer positively to [[Oda Nobunaga]], who died in the middle of the unification of Japan. He favored the Jesuit missionary [[Luís Fróis]] and generally tolerated Christianity. But overall, he undertook no remarkable policies toward Catholicism. Actually, Catholic power in his domain was trivial because he did not conquer western Japan, where the Jesuits were based. By 1579, at the height of missionary activity, there were about 130,000 converts.&lt;ref name="Early Modern Japan"&gt;L. Walker, 2002 - [[#ForeignAffairs|Foreign Affairs and Frontiers]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Toyotomi Hideyoshi and the Christian ''daimyōs'' ==

The situation was changed when [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] reunified Japan. Once he became the ruler of Japan, Hideyoshi began to pay attention to external threats, particularly the expansion of European power in East Asia.  The turning point for Catholic missions was the [[San Felipe incident (1596)|San Felipe incident]], where in an attempt to recover his cargo, the Spanish captain of a shipwrecked trading vessel claimed that the missionaries were there to prepare Japan for conquest. These claims made Hideyoshi suspicious of the foreign religion.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cooper|Cooper]], page 160:  "I have received information that in your kingdoms the promulgation of the law, i.e. Christianity, is a trick and deceit by which you overcome other kingdoms, he wrote in a letter to the Philippines in reply to the embassy led by [[Navarrete Fajardo]] in 1597.  Christian missionaries, in Hideyoshi's mind, represented the first wave of European imperialism."&lt;/ref&gt; He attempted to curb Catholicism while maintaining good trading relations with Portugal and Spain, which might have provided military support to [[Dom Justo Takayama]], a Christian ''daimyō'' in western Japan.  Many ''daimyōs'' converted to Christianity in order to gain more favorable access to [[Potassium nitrate|saltpeter]], used to make [[gunpowder]]. Between 1553 and 1620, eighty-six ''daimyōs'' were officially baptized, and many more were sympathetic to the Christians.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Toshihiko|Toshihiko]]&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1587, Hideyoshi had become alarmed, not because of too many converts but rather because the hegemon learned that Christian lords reportedly oversaw forced conversions of retainers and commoners, that they had garrisoned the city of Nagasaki, that they participated in the slave trade of other Japanese and, apparently offending Hideyoshi's Buddhist sentiments, that they allowed the slaughter of horses and oxen for food.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Elison|Elison]], pages 54 and 64&lt;/ref&gt;  After his invasion of Kyushu, Hideyoshi Toyotomi promulgated the {{Nihongo|Purge Directive Order to the Jesuits|バテレン追放令|bateren tsuihō rei}} on July 24, 1587.  It consists of 11 articles: "No. 10. Do not sell Japanese people to the Nanban (Portuguese)."  {{Citation needed|reason=Does anyone has knowledge of what the rest of the 11 articles were...?  This could really enhance this section|date=August 2010}}  Among the contents were a ban on missionaries.&lt;ref name="Jansen, page 67"/&gt;  The Jesuits in Nagasaki considered armed resistance, but the plans did not come to fruition.&lt;ref name="Jansen, page 67"/&gt;  Led by Coelho, they sought help from Kirishitan ''daimyōs'', but the ''daimyōs'' refused. Then they called for a deployment of reinforcements from their homeland and its colonies, but this plan was abolished by [[Alessandro Valignano|Valignano]]. Like the Kirishitan ''daimyōs'', he realized that a military campaign against Japan's powerful ruler would bring catastrophe to Catholicism in Japan. Valignano survived the crisis by laying all the blame on Coelho, and in 1590, the Jesuits decided to stop intervening in the struggles between the ''daimyōs'' and to disarm themselves. They only gave secret shipments of food and financial aid to Kirishitan ''daimyōs''.

However, the 1587 decree was not particularly enforced.&lt;ref name="Nosco"&gt;[[#Nosco|Nosco, 1993]]&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast to the Jesuits, the Dominicans, Franciscans, and Augustinians were openly preaching to the common peoples; this caused Hideyoshi to become concerned that commoners with divided loyalties might lead to dangerous rebels like the [[Ikkō-ikki]] sect of earlier years;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Jansen|Jansen]], pages 67–68&lt;/ref&gt; this led to Hideyoshi putting the [[Martyrs of Japan|26 Martyrs of Japan]] followers to death in 1597 on his order.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Jansen|Jansen]], page 68&lt;/ref&gt;  After Hideyoshi died in 1598, amidst the chaos of succession there was less of a focus on persecuting Christians.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Jansen|Jansen]], 68&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the 16th century, the Japanese mission had become the largest overseas Christian community that was not under the rule of a European power. Its uniqueness was emphasized by Alessandro Valignano since 1582, who promoted a deeper accommodation of Japanese culture. Japan was then the sole overseas country in which all members of those confraternities were locals, as was the case with Christian missions in Mexico, Peru, Brazil, the Philippines, or India, in spite of the presence of a colonial elite.{{clarify|date=September 2018}}

Most Japanese Christians lived in Kyushu, but Christianization was not a regional phenomenon and had a national impact. By the end of the 16th century it was possible to find baptized people in virtually every province of Japan, many of them organized in communities. On the eve of the Sekigahara battle, fifteen ''daimyōs'' were baptized, and their domains stretched from Hyūga in Southeast Kyushu to Dewa in North Honshū.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Costa, 2003 - [[#Misericordias|Misericordias]]&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of churches had been built throughout Japan.

Accepted on a national scale, Christianity was also successful among different social groups from the poor to the rich, peasants, traders, sailors, warriors, or courtesans.  Most of the daily activities of the Church were done by Japanese from the beginning, giving the Japanese Church a native face, and this was one of the reasons for its success.  By 1590, there were seventy native brothers in Japan, fully one half of Jesuits in Japan, and fifteen percent of all Jesuits who were working in Asia.

In June 1592, Hideyoshi invaded Korea; among his leading generals was Christian ''daimyō'' [[Konishi Yukinaga]].&lt;ref&gt;[#Jansen|Jansen], p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;  The actions of his forces in the massacre and enslavement of many of the Korean people were indistinguishable from the non-Christian Japanese forces that participated in the invasion.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kiernan|Kiernan]]&lt;/ref&gt;  After Konishi's loss in the battle of [[Sekigahara]], Konishi would base his refusal to commit [[seppuku]] on his Christian beliefs; instead of taking his own life, he chose capture and execution.&lt;ref&gt;[#Jansen|Jansen], pp. 5, 29&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1592 war between Japan and Korea also provided Westerners with a rare opportunity to visit Korea. Under orders of Gomaz, the Jesuit [[Gregorious de Cespedes]] arrived in Korea with a Japanese monk for the purpose of administering to the Japanese troops. He stayed there for approximately 18 months, until April or May 1595, thus being on record as the first European missionary to visit the Korean peninsula, but was unable to make any inroads. The ''Annual Letters of Japan'' made a substantial contribution to the introduction of Korea to Europe, Francis Xavier having crossed paths with Korean envoys dispatched to Japan during 1550 and 1551.

The Japanese missions were economically self-sufficient. Nagasaki's misericórdias became rich and powerful institutions which every year received large donations. The brotherhood grew in numbers to over 100 by 1585 and 150 in 1609. Controlled by the elite of Nagasaki, and not by Portuguese, it had two hospitals (one for lepers) and a large church.  By 1606, there already existed a feminine religious order called Miyako no Bikuni ("nuns of Kyoto") which accepted Korean converts such as Marina Pak, baptized in Nagasaki.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Nagasaki was called "the Rome of Japan" and most of its inhabitants were Christians. By 1611, it had ten churches and was divided into eight parishes including a specifically Korean order.

== Tokugawa response ==
[[Image:HasekuraPrayer.jpg|thumb|[[Hasekura Tsunenaga]] converted to [[Catholicism]] in [[Madrid]] in 1615.]]
Following Toyotomi Hideyoshi's death in 1598, [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] assumed power over Japan in 1600. Like Toyotomi Hideyoshi, he disliked Christian activities in Japan but gave priority to trade with Portugal and Spain. He secured Portuguese trade in 1600. He negotiated with [[Manila]] to establish trade with the Philippines. The trade promotion made his policies toward Catholicism inconsistent. At the same time, in an attempt to wrest control of the Japan trade from the Catholic countries, Dutch and British traders advised the Shogunate that Spain did indeed have territorial ambitions, and that Catholicism was Spain's principal means. The Dutch and British promised, in distinction, that they would limit themselves to trading and would not conduct missionary activities in Japan.

It seems that the Jesuits realized that the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] was much stronger and more stable than Toyotomi Hideyoshi's administration, yet the mendicant orders discussed military options relatively openly. In 1615, a [[Franciscan]] emissary of the Viceroy of [[New Spain]] asked the shogun for land to build a Spanish fortress and this deepened Japan's suspicion against Catholicism and the  [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] colonial powers behind it. The Jesuits and the Mendicant Orders kept a lasting rivalry over the Japanese mission and attached to different imperial strategies.

===Early Persecution ===
The [[Tokugawa shogunate]] finally decided to ban Catholicism. The statement on the "Expulsion of all missionaries from Japan", drafted by [[Zen]] monk Konchiin Suden (1563–1633) and issued in 1614 under the name of second shogun [[Tokugawa Hidetada|Hidetada]] (ruled 1605-1623), was considered the first official statement of a comprehensive control of Kirishitan.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Higashibaba|Higashibaba]], page 139:  ''The Kirishitan band happened to reach Japan. Not only have they sent merchant vessels to exchange commodities, but they also spread a pernicious doctrine to confuse the right ones, so that they would change the government of the country and own the country.  This will become a great catastrophe. We cannot but stop it. ''&lt;/ref&gt; It claimed that the Christians were bringing disorder to Japanese society and that their followers "contravene governmental regulations, traduce Shinto, calumniate the True Law, destroy regulations, and corrupt goodness".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Shimizu|Shimizu]], pages 284–286&lt;/ref&gt;  It was fully implemented and canonized as one of the fundamental Tokugawan laws.  In the same year, the bakufu required all subjects of all domains to register at their local Buddhist temple; this would become an annual requirement in 1666, cementing the Buddhist temples as an instrument of state control.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Jansen|Jansen]], page 57&lt;/ref&gt;

The immediate cause of the prohibition was the [[Okamoto Daihachi incident]], a case of fraud involving Ieyasu's Catholic [[vavasor]], but there were also other reasons behind it. The [[shogunate]] was concerned about a possible invasion by the [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] colonial powers, which had previously occurred in the New World and the Philippines. Domestically, the ban was closely related to measures against the [[Toyotomi clan]]. 
The Buddhist [[ecclesiastical]] establishment was made responsible for verifying that a person was not a Christian through what became known as the "temple guarantee system" (terauke seido). By the 1630s, people were being required to produce a certificate of affiliation with a Buddhist temple as proof of religious orthodoxy, social acceptability and loyalty to the regime.

In the mid-17th century, the shogunate demanded the expulsion of all European missionaries and the execution of all converts.&lt;ref name="Mullins"&gt;[[#Mullins|Mullins]], 1990&lt;/ref&gt; This marked the end of open Christianity in Japan. The bakufu erected bulletin boards nationwide at crossroads and bridges; among the many proscriptions listed on these boards were strict warnings against Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Jansen|Jansen]], page 58&lt;/ref&gt;

The systematic persecution beginning in 1614 faced stiff resistance from Christians, despite the departure of more than half the clergy. Once again, the main reason for this resistance was not the presence of a few priests but rather the self-organization of many communities. Forced to secrecy, and having a small number of clergymen working underground, the Japanese Church was able to recruit leadership from among lay members. Japanese children caused admiration among the Portuguese and seem to have participated actively in the resistance. Nagasaki remained a Christian city in the first decades of the 17th century and during the general persecutions other confraternities were founded in Shimabara, Kinai and Franciscans in Edo.
[[Image:ChristianMartyrsOfNagasaki.jpg|thumb|The Christian martyrs of [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]]. 17th-century Japanese painting.]]

The number of active Christians is estimated to have been around 200,000 in 1582.&lt;ref&gt;[[#CathEnJapan|Catholic Encyclopedia, Japan entry]]&lt;/ref&gt; There were likely around 1,000 known martyrs during the missionary period. In contrast, Christians attach a great importance to martyrdom and persecution, noting that countless more people were dispossessed of their land and property leading to their subsequent death in poverty.
[[Image:Jesus on cross to step on.jpg|thumb|''[[Fumi-e]]'', a picture of Christ used to reveal practicing Christians]]
The Japanese government used ''[[fumi-e]]'' to reveal practicing Catholics and sympathizers. ''Fumi-e'' were pictures of the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] or [[Christ]]. People reluctant to step on the pictures were identified as Christian and taken to Nagasaki. If they refused to renounce their religion, they were tortured; those who still refused were executed.

===Later persecution ===
The [[Shimabara Rebellion]], led by a young Christian man named [[Amakusa Shirō|Amakusa Shirō Tokisada]], took place against the shogunate in 1637. The rebellion broke out over economic desperation and government oppression but later assumed a religious tone.  About 27,000 people joined the uprising, but it was crushed by the shogunate after a sustained campaign. The reigning shogun, [[Tokugawa Iemitsu]], who had issued the [[Sakoku Edict of 1635|Sakoku Edict]], restricting trade and effectively isolating Japan, two years earlier, came down hard on the Christians. Many Japanese were deported to [[Macau]] or to the Spanish [[Philippines]]. Many [[Macanese people|Macanese]] and Japanese [[Mestizo]]s are the mixed-race descendants of the deported Japanese Catholics. About 400 were officially deported by the government to Macau and Manila, but thousands of Japanese were pressured into moving voluntarily. About 10,000 Macanese and 3,000 Japanese were moved to Manila.

The Catholic remnant in Japan were driven underground, and its members became known as the [[Kakure Kirishitan|"Hidden Christians"]]. Some priests remained in Japan illegally, including 18 Jesuits, seven Franciscans, seven Dominicans, one Augustinian, five seculars and an unknown number of Jesuit [[irmao]] and [[dojuku]]. Since this time corresponds to the [[Thirty Years' War]] between Catholics and Protestants in Germany, it is possible that the checking of Catholic power in Europe reduced the flow of funds to the Catholic missions in Japan, which could be why they failed at this time and not before. During the [[Edo period]], the [[Kakure Kirishitan]] kept their faith. Biblical phrases or prayers were transferred orally from parent to child, and secret posts (mizukata) were assigned in their underground community to baptize their children, all while regional governments continuously operated [[fumi-e]] to expose Christians.

==Christian view of Kirishitan History ==
Those who participated in the Shimabara Revolt are not considered to be martyrs by the [[Catholic Church]] since they took up arms for materialistic reasons.

Drawn from the oral histories of Japanese Catholic communities, [[Shūsaku Endō]]'s novel "[[Silence (novel)|Silence]]" provides detailed accounts of the persecution of Christian communities and the suppression of the Church.

== Rediscovery and return ==
[[Image:NagasakiMonumentToMartyrs.jpg|thumb|right|Monument to Kirishitan martyrs in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]]]]

Japan was forced to open to foreign interaction by [[Matthew C. Perry|Matthew Perry]] in 1853. It became possible for foreigners to live in Japan with the [[Treaty of Amity and Commerce (United States–Japan)|Harris Treaty]] in 1858. Many Christian clergymen were sent from Catholic, Protestant and Orthodox Churches, though proselytizing was still banned. In 1865, some of the Japanese who lived in [[Urakami]] village near [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] visited the new [[Ōura Church]] which had been built by the [[Paris Foreign Missions Society]] ([[:fr:Missions étrangères de Paris|Missions étrangères de Paris]]) barely a month before. A female member of the group spoke to a French priest, [[Bernard Petitjean]], and confessed that their families had kept the Kirishitan faith. Those Kirishitan wanted to see the statue of St. Mary with their own eyes, and to confirm that the priest was single and truly came from the pope in Rome. After this interview, many Kirishitan thronged toward Petitjean. He investigated their underground organizations and discovered that they had kept the rite of baptism and the liturgical years without European priests for nearly 250 years. Petitjean’s report surprised the Christian world; Pope [[Pius IX]] called it a miracle.

The [[Edo]] Shogunate's edicts banning Christianity were still on the books, however, and thus the religion continued to be persecuted up to 1867, the last year of its rule. [[Robert Bruce Van Valkenburgh]], the American minister-resident in Japan, privately complained of this persecution to the Nagasaki magistrates, though little action was taken to stop it. The succeeding [[Meiji government|government]] under [[Emperor Meiji]], who took over from the Tokugawa shogunate in 1868, initially continued in this vein and several thousand people were exiled ([[Urakami Yoban Kuzure]]). After Europe and the U.S. began to vocally criticize the persecution, the Japanese government realized that it needed to lift the ban in order to attain its interests. In 1873 the ban was lifted. Numerous exiles returned and began construction of the [[Urakami Cathedral]], which was completed in 1895.

It was later revealed that tens of thousands of Kirishitan still survived in some regions near Nagasaki. Some officially returned to the Roman Catholic Church. Others remained apart from the Catholic Church and have stayed as [[Kakure Kirishitan]], retaining their own traditional beliefs and their descendants asserting that they keep their ancestors' religion.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Miyazaki|Miyazaki]], pp. 282-3&lt;/ref&gt; However, it became difficult for them to keep their community and rituals, so they have converted to [[Buddhism]] or [[Shinto]] eventually.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Miyazaki|Miyazaki]], pp.284-286&lt;/ref&gt; When John Paul II visited Nagasaki in 1981, he baptized some young people from Kakure Kirishitan families, a rare occurrence.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Miyazaki|Miyazaki]], p.287&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kong Xuan''' (孔宣) is a [[peacock]] spirit who became [[King Zhou]]’s general in the novel ''[[Fengshen Yanyi]]''. His character is based on [[Mahamayuri]] from Buddhist myth.

When the evil king Zhou, the last ruler of [[Shang dynasty]] was rebelled against by his former subordinate King Wu, general Kong Xuan fought the rebel army in the Golden Cock Range.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gj.zdic.net/archive.php?aid-24693.html Xu Zhonglin. Fengshen Yanyi. chapter 68-71 (chinese text)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kong Xuan has five different rays of light which will sweep his enemy into a void, thus he gave king Wu’s armies a hard times against him. Even king Wu’s mightiest generals such as [[Nezha]] and Yang Jian ([[Erlang Shen]]) are no match against him.

However, in the end Kong Quan is defeated by Candi, a Buddha from the west. He then reverted into his original form a giant peacock and become Candi’s mount.

'''Legio Maria''' ([[Latin]], “Legion of Mary”) — also known as '''Legio Maria of African Church Mission''', and '''Maria Legio''' — is an [[African initiated church]] or [[new religious movement]] initiating among the [[Luo people of Kenya and Tanzania|Luo people]] of western [[Kenya]], which is an extension of an interpretation of the [[Three Secrets of Fátima]] to a new, albeit African, context. The religious movement was initiated by repeated appearances of a mystic woman to several Roman Catholic members delivering messages about the incarnation of the son of God as a black man. These appearances are said to have begun around 1938, almost simultaneous with the beginning of [[Edel Quinn|Edel Quinn's]] lay catholic mission on behalf of the [[Legion of Mary]] to Africa.

By the early 1960s, the movement had assembled a good number of catechists, acolytes, and believers in a spiritual return of Jesus Christ. The continuous expansion of this movement coupled with its belief in Simeo Ondetto as the returned Son of God led to theological tension, and eventual break with the lay Catholic movement, the [[Legion of Mary]]. Legio Maria was legally registered in Kenya in 1966 as a church, expanded massively in the late 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, and eventually spread to many countries in Africa, including Uganda, Tanzania, Congo, Zaire, Rwanda, Ethiopia, Sudan, and Nigeria. In 1966, one of its founders, Mama Maria, died and was buried at Efeso Church, in Nzoia, [[Siaya County]], while the principal founder, Simeo Ondetto, died in 1991 and was buried in Got Calvary, in [[Migori County]].

==History==

===Formation===
Legio Maria developed gradually and eventually separated from mainstream [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Oloo, Tobias. 2013. Ruoth Oduogo. Legio Maria publishers, Kisumu&lt;/ref&gt; What is now Legio Maria started from the Catholic lay movement as far back as 1938-1940. Central to its formation are the local Luo myths about a mystery woman, min Omolo Ka-Nyunja, who walked Luo land during these years. A number of Legio Maria faithfuls believe that this woman was responsible for the mythical stories such as Nyamgondho Kombare in Gwassi, Homa Bay County, and Simbi Nyaima in Karachuonyo, Homa Bay County. According to Tobias Oloo, a Legio Maria Deacon and researcher, "every religion has mythical elements and the Legio Maria movement's development relied massively on the crystallization of local myths with their beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Oloo, Tobias. (2014). Legio as it grew. A pamphlet for legios. Legio maria publishers. Kisumu&lt;/ref&gt;" Apart from the myths that probably preceded Legio Maria, Deacon Oloo affirms that the Fátima Visitation of Virgin Mary was a key ingredient to the formation of Legio Maria. "As legios, we recognize the three Fatima mysteries. However, the most important for us is the third mystery which predicted the appearance of Our Lord in the 1960s. Though this mystery is controversial because the Roman Catholic did not reveal it for generations and what they eventually revealed is still contested by many Christians, we have faith that through the third mystery Mary promised the coming of Simeo Ondetto.&lt;ref&gt;Oloo, Tobias. (2014). Legio as it grew. A pamphlet for legios. Legio maria publishers. Kisumu&lt;/ref&gt;"

===Demographics===
In 1963 a movement of dissatisfied Roman Catholics in south [[Nyanza Province]] left the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Kisii|Diocese of Kisii]] and formed the Legio Maria Church, or Legion of Mary Church, under the leadership of the Lodvikus-son of God Simeo Melkio Ondetto and an old mystic woman named Mama Maria. This mystic woman is the one Legio Maria adherents relate with the Fátima Secrets.&lt;ref&gt;http://legiopedia.com {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150123015815/http://legiopedia.com/ |date=23 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She is believed to have called a number of Catholics to the new movement by visionary appearances, telling them to look forward to her son who had come to Africa. Her spiritual son, Simeo Ondetto, was then a catechist in Roman Catholic Church. Ondetto was [[excommunicated]] by the Catholic Church in the 1960s. By 1980 the church numbered 248,000 adherents.&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, David and John Padwick (1989), ''Rise Up and Walk!: Conciliarism and the African Indigenous Churches, 1815 – 1987'', [[Nairobi]]: [[Oxford University Press]], 199, 66&lt;/ref&gt; Government estimates at the time of the split from the Catholic Church stated that there were nearly 90,000 followers of Legio Maria. By 1968, it had become a member of the East African United Churches.

The Legio Maria Church was not the only church schism among the Luo people in the early years of Kenyan independence. Catholic missionaries had been working among the Luo for 61 years before the 1963 split.&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, David (1968), "Schism and Renewal in Africa: an Analysis of Six Thousand Contemporary Religious Movements." [[Nairobi]]: [[Oxford University Press]], 135&lt;/ref&gt; By 1966 there were 31 “distinct Luo separatist churches registered with the Kenyan Government.”&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, David (1968), "Schism and Renewal in Africa: an Analysis of Six Thousand Contemporary Religious Movements." [[Nairobi]]: [[Oxford University Press]], 14&lt;/ref&gt; Across Kenya, “by 1966 there were 160 distinct bodies with a total of 600,000 adherents, most of whom were formerly members of the Protestant or Catholic Churches,” with the Legion of Mary Church being the largest of the schisms from the Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, David (1968), "Schism and Renewal in Africa: an Analysis of Six Thousand Contemporary Religious Movements." [[Nairobi]]: [[Oxford University Press]], 30&lt;/ref&gt; Today, estimates of the number of Legio Maria adherents range from 3.5 to 4 million&lt;ref&gt;Oloo, Tobias. (2014). Legio as it grew. A pamphlet for legios. Legio maria publishers. kisumu&lt;/ref&gt; or down to just over three million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eastandard.net/archives/cl/hm_news/news.php?articleid=4064 Rambaya, Samwel, “Legio Pope Blasts Leaders”, ''The Standard (Kenya)'', Monday, 25 October 2004]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In this regard, the Legio Maria Church is one of the most resilient and successful of the African initiated churches.

While the Legio Maria Church began exclusively as a movement among the Luo people, it is now found all over Kenya and even has significant numbers of communities among the [[Turkana people|Turkana]], [[Kalenjin people|Kalenjin]], [[Kamba people|Kamba]] and [[Luhya people]]s of Kenya and in Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, DRC, and Ethiopia. In 1979, the word "mission" was added to the church's official name, becoming the “Legio Maria of African Church Mission.”&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, Nancy (2005), "Dreaming in Color: Anti-essentialism in Legio Maria Dream Narratives", ''Journal of Religion in Africa'' 35, no. 2: 159&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins of the Movement===
According to Legio Maria leaders and researchers, the origins of the movement can be traced to the convergence of at least four separate events: the concealment by the Roman Catholic Church of ‘the third secret of Fátima;’ the visions of Mary to several people informing them of the coming of her son; Simeo Ondetto’s supernatural attributes that established him as a spiritual leader; the coming of the Holy Spirit at the home of John Baru in Suna Migori and the Spirit's declaration that Simeo Ondetto is the incarnated son of God; and several miracles and wonders that accompanied the mission of Ondetto, Mary, and numberless Legio Prophets.&lt;ref&gt;Oloo, Tobias. (2014). Legio as it grew. A pamphlet for legios. Legio maria publishers. kisumu&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reliance on Prophets===
Legio Maria had many notable prophets at its founding. According to Tobias Oloo,it is the massive number of prophets and prophetesses in Legio Maria that made it break into a formidable religious organization.&lt;ref&gt;lejionmaria.blogspot.com&lt;/ref&gt; Among the prophets that Oloo attributes the success of a young legio movement to are Tobias Oongo, Silvester Okweto, Sila of Yimbo, Siprianus Ochien'g, and Gaudencia Aoko. The name of Gaudencia Aoko has featured prominently as a founder and even a co-equal with Simeo Ondetto, but according to Tobias Oloo, this is a confusion.&lt;ref&gt;Oloo, Tobias. (2014). Legio as it grew. A pamphlet for legios. Legio maria publishers. kisumu&lt;/ref&gt; Oloo affirmed that Gaudencia Aoko achieved great feats for Legio Maria, but was in no way comparable to Simeo Ondetto.&lt;ref&gt;lejionmaria.blogspot.com&lt;/ref&gt; Born among the Luo of western Kenya, Aoko was only 20 when she joined Legio Maria. The death of her two children, apparently thought to be due to witchcraft pushed her to seek divine intervention from the 'budding prophet Simeo Ondetto' leading to her eventual conversion.&lt;ref&gt;http://legiopedia.com {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150123015815/http://legiopedia.com/ |date=23 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aoko was referred to Ondetto by her brother-in-law, Johanes Muga, and went to Ondetto to seek help. She was commissioned to pray for the sick with Rosary and to battle witchcraft by Simeo Ondetto and the old woman, Mama Maria. Going back to her homeland in Kano and stretching to Alego, Siaya, of Western Kenya, Aoko exorcised evil spirits, burnt amulets, and converted many people to the Legio movement. Tobias Oloo insists that it is the agility of the young Aoko that led to her being confused with the 90-year-old legio maria founder, Mama Maria.&lt;ref&gt;Ong'ombe, Romanus (2007), "The Founding Years of Legio: Legio Prophets."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Migori]]

====The Third Secret of Fátima====
The [[Three Secrets of Fátima]] are related to a number of appearances of Mary to three shepherd children in 1917 at Fátima, Portugal. It was there that Mary revealed three secrets to the shepherds. The Catholic Church released the first two secrets in the 1940s but the surviving shepherd did not write down the third secret until 1944. She sealed the envelope and instructed the church to not open the secret until 1960.  The Legio Maria Church believes that Church officials in Rome refused to release the true secret because it revealed Mary's prophecy of a Black Christ for Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, Nancy (2005), "Dreaming in Color: Anti-essentialism in Legio Maria Dream Narratives", ''Journal of Religion in Africa'' 35, no. 2: 164&lt;/ref&gt;  Schwartz recounts the theory:
{{quote|Angry at Rome, Mary decided to ‘walk away from those people’. She determined apparitions no longer sufficed. She would tread on African soil as a person with her Son.  Colorless in Heaven, both would become black Africans and bring her message directly to a more receptive audience. Legios declared ‘The Third Secret of Fatima’ was about the mission of the son of God in Africa,the coming of Legio, and the beginning of a new religious age.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, Nancy (2005), "Dreaming in Color: Anti-essentialism in Legio Maria Dream Narratives", ''Journal of Religion in Africa'' 35, no. 2: 167&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 2000, the Catholic Church released the official third secret of Fátima alongside a commentary on the meaning of the secret written by then Cardinal [[Joseph Ratzinger]].&lt;ref&gt;Anon. (2000) “Vatican issues text of third secret of Fatima.” ''Christian Century'' 117, no. 21 (19 July): 749–750&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dead and Risen===
While at Sagegi in 1958, serving as a Catholic catechist, and living in the home of another catechist known as Petrus Pitalis Ogeka, Simeo Ondeto is said to have died for 3 days and came back to life with a mission-focused approach.&lt;ref&gt;Oloo, Tobias. (2014). Legio as it grew. A pamphlet for legios. Legio maria publishers. kisumu&lt;/ref&gt; After rising from death, Ondetto began to call himself the son of God. He was now preaching that he had gone to confer with God the Father about his mission and was freed to begin his mission. He describes a visit to heaven, chats with saints, angels, and God. Simeo Ondetto permitted the baptism of polygamists and the baptism of old Catholic converts without going through catechism training.&lt;ref&gt;http://legiopedia.com {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150123015815/http://legiopedia.com/ |date=23 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also said that he was sent to start a church called Legio Maria.

====Appearances of the Virgin Mary====
According to early adherents of Legio Maria, the Virgin Mary began appearing among the Luo people in the late 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Oloo, Tobias. 2013. Ruoth Oduogo. Legio Maria publishers, kisumu&lt;/ref&gt; In their accounts, they say that she first appeared as an extraordinary itinerary woman. At a time estimated to be around 1935, this woman was walking at Awendo market in South Nyanza, when an empathizing tailor known as Omollo who was the son of Nyunja of Alego, Udida, gave her a dress gift. This woman is said to have promised Omollo an eternal name among the Luos.&lt;ref&gt;Oloo, Tobias. 2013. Ruoth Oduogo. Legio Maria publishers, Kisumu&lt;/ref&gt; From that day on she began calling herself the mother of Omollo. By the 1940s, this woman is claimed to have visited the Catholic parish of Nyandago and conversed with over five members of its clergy about the mission of Ondetto. However, priests at Nyandago mission discounted the supposed apparitions, stating that Mary could not appear as a Black African.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, Nancy (2005), "Dreaming in Color: Anti-essentialism in Legio Maria Dream Narratives", ''Journal of Religion in Africa'' 35, no. 2: 172&lt;/ref&gt;

Legio tradition tells of Mary and her son being incarnated as Luo in the beginning of the 1900s, with Mary entering into an earlier time period than Jesus. Mary wandered throughout Luo land during this time, performing healings and other miracles; the church was officially organised “when the 90-year-old Mary and her adult spiritual Son, Simeo Ondeto, were reunited in Suna, South Nyanza followed by the coming of the Holy Spirit(Mount the World Has Opened to the Light).”&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, Nancy (2005), "Dreaming in Color: Anti-essentialism in Legio Maria Dream Narratives", ''Journal of Religion in Africa'' 35, no. 2: 168&lt;/ref&gt;  Schwartz recounts that the "Black Mary 'returned to Heaven' on 23 December 1966, and that those who met her claimed “direct personal experience of Mary’s disclosure of the meanings of the 'Third Secret of Fatima,'" in which it was revealed that “the Virgin Mary brought a new liberating religion for the world through an African Mission!”&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, Nancy (2005), "Dreaming in Color: Anti-essentialism in Legio Maria Dream Narratives", ''Journal of Religion in Africa'' 35, no. 2: 179&lt;/ref&gt;  At nearly 90 years of age, from 1963 to 1966, the mystical Mary could not reach many places. This resulted in the confusion of Gaudencia Aoko, a prophet, with Mama Maria, the harbinger who prepared the world for the coming of her son.

===Birth and Early Life of Simeo Ondetto===
Born in around 1926 to Luo parents, Margaret Aduwo and Obimbo Misumba, the Black Son of God (Simeo Ondeto) grew up in Angoro village, Kano location, near the Nyanza-Rift Valley border.&lt;ref&gt;Oloo, Tobias. 2013. Ruoth Oduogo. Legio Maria publishers, kisumu&lt;/ref&gt; He was named Ondetto by his parents and later got baptised as Simeo after years of studying catechism. According to his brother, Nelson Owino Obimbo, a Legio Maria Cardinal Dean(2011), Simeo was an extraordinary child. Owino who is older than Ondetto lists around six childhood miracles performed by Ondetto while young.&lt;ref&gt;Oloo, Tobias. 2013. Ruoth Oduogo. Legio Maria publishers, kisumu&lt;/ref&gt; Ondetto left their home in Awasi as a young man, worked at Miwani Sugar Company in Western Kenya for a short duration before moving to Tanzania Mara to stay with his relatives there. Around 1955,Ondetto returned home in Awasi, only focused on a missionary life. To find a way of keeping him home, his parents called a meeting that resolved that the only way to keep him home was to have him get married.&lt;ref&gt;Oloo, Tobias. 2013. Ruoth Oduogo. Legio Maria publishers, Kisumu&lt;/ref&gt; Ondetto declined the offer of a wife and instead kept a life of solitude and meditation. He moved to Sagegi to live with a catholic catechist before starting the Legio movement.

===Gaudencia Aoko Fetters===
After joining the Legio movement, Gaudencia Aoko converted so many people. In Luo central Nyanza, she was the most visible figure of Legio Maria during its founding years.&lt;ref&gt;Oloo, Tobias. 2013. Ruoth Oduogo. Legio Maria publishers, Kisumu&lt;/ref&gt; That she was the founder of Legio is often a confusion with Mama Maria, a 90-year old mystic woman who revealed visions to many Legions.  When official church doctrine restricted Aoko's role to only a prophet and legio nun, without giving her the priestly position that she had occupied in the lives of the many people she converted, conflict set in. Aoko, felt females were not being given enough room. According to Deacon Tobias Oloo, Aoko's departure from Legio Maria was not a statement that she did not believe in Ondetto as God. In fact, Oloo affirms that Aoko continued to revere Ondetto even after her departure, using the images of Ondetto and Mama Maria on her worship altars and advising her followers to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Oloo, Tobias. 2013. Ruoth Oduogo. Legio Maria publishers, Kisumu&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, during her tense battles to retain her high position in Legio Maria, in 1968, Aoko went to a press conference and announced that she was the official founder of Legio, and expelled Simeo Ondetto and two other leaders of the church for giving themselves the titles of “God,” “Pope,” and “Cardinal.” This moment of decision is recognized as Aoko's spiritual downfall. She lost her charisma; went for a second baptism in Tanzania Mara by Mercellianus Orongo, another Legion who left the movement because of Ondetto's claims to be the son of God; and by 1971, Aoko was negotiating a return to Legio Maria as an ordinary worshiper.&lt;ref&gt;Oloo, Tobias. 2013. Ruoth Oduogo. Legio Maria publishers, Kisumu&lt;/ref&gt;

==Official hierarchy==
The full official title for Simeo Ondeto became Baba Simeo Lodvikus Melkio, the eternal spiritual leader and mediator of Legio Maria.
  
The administrative duties of the church were put under a Pope.  So far, there have been four such popes:

* Pope Timothy Joseph Blasio Atila (1963–1998).
* Pope Maria Pius Lawrence Jairo Chiaji Adera (1998–2004)
* Pope Raphael Titus Otieno (2004–present)&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, Nancy (2005), “Dreaming in Color: Anti-essentialism in Legio Maria Dream Narratives'', Journal of Religion in Africa 35, no. 2: 179&lt;/ref&gt; (disputed from 2010)
* Romanus On'gombe (2010–present) (disputed)
By 2010, there were differences in Legio Maria that led to the coronation of a cardinal, Romanus On'gombe, as a pope while Rafael Adika still claimed the position. The differences between the two leaders has taken legio Maria to the courts more than three times, and the differences still persist.&lt;ref&gt;Oloo, Tobias. 2013. Ruoth Oduogo. Legio Maria publishers, Kisumu&lt;/ref&gt; According to Deacon Tobias Oloo, the differences will end soon. "Simeo Ondetto has foretold those differences and said that legio Marias unity will return under the fourth pope.&lt;ref&gt;Oloo, Tobias. (2014). Legio as it grew. A pamphlet for legios. Legio maria publishers. Kisumu&lt;/ref&gt;"
Under the popes are over 500 deacons, 350 priests, 60 bishops, 21 archbishops and 17 cardinals. Currently, all these lower hierarchies swear allegiance to the different sides led by Adika and On'gombe.&lt;ref&gt;http://legiopedia.com {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150123015815/http://legiopedia.com/ |date=23 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some notable people on the On'gombe side are On'gawo Aloo (Cardinal Admin), Owino Obimbo (cardinal Dean), Romanus Odongo (Arch-bishop-Rongo), the late Susana nyar Ouma (Ondetto's cook), and Bishop Melkio. Notable people on Adika's side are Cardinal Atieno (cardinal admin), Maurice Akello (chief-Deacon), Elias Komenya, Mother Dorina (Ka-Baru, and Hellena nyar Rosari.&lt;ref&gt;Oloo, Tobias. (2014).

A parallel hierarchy to the male priesthood is the Legio Maria women priesthood that is led by Nuns (Mothers). Legio nuns are married women who are ordained.&lt;ref&gt;Oloo, Tobias. (2014). Legio as it grew. A pamphlet for legios. Legio maria publishers. Kisumu&lt;/ref&gt; The lowest female rank in Legio Maria church is sisterhood, then mother (heads a mission), superior mother (heads a diocese), arch mother (heads an arch diocese), and Dean mother (head of legio mothers).&lt;ref&gt;Oloo, Tobias. (2014). Legio as it grew. A pamphlet for legios. Legio maria publishers. Kisumu&lt;/ref&gt;
Below the clergy are church teachers and church administrators who are elected by the faithful. Prophets are also core to the Legio Maria mission because the church is Spirit Initiated.

==Resurrection of Simeo Ondeto==
Legio Maria believes that Simeo Ondeto is alive forever. According to Romanus On'gombe: "Simeo is God. God never dies, he lives. Even those christians who believe that Jesus was dead body and soul are simply mistaken. If Jesus is God he never died because God never dies. What happened is that God was incarnated and took up a body like ours. When he returns to heaven, he gives up this body and remains God. He becomes spirit as he was before he became a body."&lt;ref&gt;Oloo, Tobias. (2014). Legio as it grew. A pamphlet for legios. Legio maria publishers. Kisumu&lt;/ref&gt;
Indeed, Legio Maria members attest to post-death appearances of Simeo Ondeto. They assert that Simeo Ondeto appeared at Calvary to many people before his burial. That Simeo Ondeto appeared to a doctor who was called to preserve his body and the physician ran away after seeing Ondeto alive; that Simeo Ondeto spoke through the spirit even when his flesh was yet to be buried; that on the day of his burial, Simeo Ondeto appeared to a group of Legio Maria prophets called the Michaels' and asked them to go pray for the sick instead of mourning; and that Simeo Ondeto appeared to Dalmas Oyier, his closest friend several weeks after he was buried. Legio Maria faithful also attest that Simeo Ondeto appeared and taught them during two of his memorials. Ondeto is said to have appeared in person in his memorial of 1992 and to over 30,000 Legio Maria faithful in his memorial of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Oloo, Tobias. (2014). Legio as it grew. A pamphlet for legios. Legio maria publishers. Kisumu&lt;/ref&gt;

==Messianic Theology==
According to Legio Maria teaching Simeo Ondetto is the son of God sent to establish the glory of God on earth. Legio Maria believes in dispensations or times when God has stepped into human history after the fall of man.  The first is found in the Old Testament “when the High Priest [[Melchizedek]] appeared to Abraham. Melchizedek established a reign of a monotheistic awareness which ended with the arrival of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Oloo, Tobias. (2014). Legio as it grew. A pamphlet for legios. Legio maria publishers. Kisumu&lt;/ref&gt; The dispensation established by Jesus was one of recognising the trinity, of individual salvation, and established universal barometer of religion which is love. Instead of the law, the second dispensation is characterised by love. The third dispensation is the reign of God established by Simeo Ondetto as Lodvikus, that is the son of God sent to show the glory of God to the World.&lt;ref&gt;Oloo, Tobias. (2014). Legio as it grew. A pamphlet for legios. Legio maria publishers. Kisumu&lt;/ref&gt; In Legio Maria theology, the second person of the trinity has appeared in history three times: as Melchizedek Son of God to define the history of the human redemption by blessing God's chosen race through Abraham; as Jesus to conclude the mission of redemption, opening it and teaching the core element which is love; and as Simeo Lodvikus, to reveal the glory of life after death and the nature of God. To Legio Maria faithfuls, Simeo Ondetto, Jesus of Nazareth and Melchizedek are one and the same person incarnated during different dispensations of human history.&lt;ref&gt;Oloo, Tobias. (2014). Legio as it grew. A pamphlet for legios. Legio maria publishers. Kisumu&lt;/ref&gt;  
Simeo Ondeto is known as the Lodvikus or [[The Glory of God]], whose role is to bring the world to understand the hidden treasures of life after death and dramatise the reality of eternal life. According to Legio Maria the promise by Jesus to return has been fulfilled by the coming of Simeo. Legio Maria also seems not to believe in a final judgement of the whole world. They believe in immediate judgement of individuals immediately after death. This is supported by the long list of adored Legio saints. Some of the official Legio Maria saints include Timotheo Atila, Maria Ombwayo, Tobias Oongo, Petro Otieno, Mumbo Carilus and Angi Clement.&lt;ref&gt;Oloo, Tobias. (2014). Legio as it grew. A pamphlet for legios. Legio maria publishers. Kisumu&lt;/ref&gt; Church leaders distinguish Messias Simeo Ondeto's mission as separate from that of Jesus. He was not sent to replace Jesus, for Jesus was a name given to the son of God when he accomplished a second dispensational mission. Instead, Messias Simeo Ondeto is God incarnated in another context, specifically for the third dispensation of the glory of God. Often, 1 John 4:1 is used as biblical support for the confession that God has again come into the flesh through Messias Simeo Ondeto, for “every spirit which confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God and every Spirit that does not confess Jesus is not of God…Therefore we say that Jesus has come in the flesh.
Finding Africa in the yoke of colonialism, Simeo is also talked of as a saviour from the oppression of colonialism and “healer and protector from the evils of witchcraft.”&lt;ref&gt;Pobee, J. (1992), “Exploring Afro-Christology” Frankfurt am Main; New York: P. Lang,142&lt;/ref&gt;  Simeo Ondeto is not seen merely God’s messenger, but as “the actual embodiment of God in history.”&lt;ref&gt;Pobee, J. (1992), “Exploring Afro-Christology” Frankfurt am Main; New York: P. Lang,140&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In their affirmation that Messias Simeo Ondeto is the Black Messiah, the Legio Maria do not exclude the possibility and reality that the Messiah has been incarnated in multiple times and contexts.  In interviews during her three years researching the Legio Maria Church, Nancy Schwartz relates,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
most Legios insisted to me that theirs was not the only way to choose light and Heaven. The Baba Messias Ondeto had preached that ‘God is a polygynist’ who loves ‘all the houses in his home’. All religions, he had said, are akin to ‘branches of a tree that bears fruit’.  Legios reiterated that black and white people could both get to Heaven, if they followed their faiths.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, Nancy (1989), “World Without End: The Meanings and Movements in the History, Narratives and 'Tongue-Speech' of Legio Maria of African Church Mission among Luo of Kenya.” Ph.D. dissertation, Princeton University, 131–133&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Thus, salvation is available through other religions and revelations of God.  While the Legio are clear that God has provided specific revelations and even incarnations for different peoples of the world, this does not translate into an exclusivist position in which only adherents of Legio Maria will be with God in heaven.  According to Schwartz, “most Legios affirmed that Heaven was a place where the Father, Son, Holy Spirit, Mary, saints, angels and Old Testament prophets and patriarchs are without color, a place where there is nothing like [[Mzungu]] (European/white person) and African.”&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, Nancy (2005), “Dreaming in Color: Anti-essentialism in Legio Maria Dream Narratives'', Journal of Religion in Africa 35, no. 2: 167&lt;/ref&gt;  She concludes that the Legio Maria Church has “formulat[ed] their own version of an anti-racist black liberation theology,” which is unique.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, Nancy (2005), “Dreaming in Color: Anti-essentialism in Legio Maria Dream Narratives'', Journal of Religion in Africa 35, no. 2: 188&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practices==

===Prayers and Worship===
The Legio Maria Church meets as individual congregations for regular prayer and worship.  Often the congregations live together in community homes.  The Church uses many Roman Catholic hymns in worship services, and employs both original Legio Maria songs and Catholic hymns in informal services, often accompanied with singing, teaching and prayers.  Crosses, swords and other symbols are often carried by male adherents or worn around their necks.  During worship, both men and women wear robes and women additionally wear head coverings.  The robes and head coverings can be any number of colours, and some communities wear their robes at all times as a distinguishing mark of Legio identity.  Candles are normally present in worship as representations of spiritual presence.  The Legio, in addition to Legio-specific African saints, recognise most Roman Catholic saints.

===Strict Holiness===
As an AIC, some aspects of African traditional religion and beliefs are incorporated into the church, including the early revelation to Simeo Ondeto that polygamists could be baptised into the church.  In this sense, the church is more willing to accept some cultural practices, but this is balanced by a strict sense of holiness.  According to Dirven, there are also “rigorous and legalistic taboos to drinking, smoking, dancing and wearing shoes in holy places — trumpeted as the essence of a strict moral code.”&lt;ref&gt;Dirven, Peter J. (1970), “A Protest and a Challenge: the Maria Legio Breakaway Church in West Kenya.” AFER 12, no. 2 (April): 131&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gifts of the Holy Spirit===
Essentially Legio Maria is a spirit reliant religious movement. All the adherents respect the spirit as the guide of Legio. Even while the Simeo Ondeto and the Black Mary were still alive, it was possible for them to be in one place in Kenya while teaching and visiting other adherents through spirit delivered teachings of glossolalia and holy spirit possessing prophets to convey messages from them .&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, Nancy (2005), “Dreaming in Color: Anti-essentialism in Legio Maria Dream Narratives'', Journal of Religion in Africa 35, no. 2: 175&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a very serious offence to falsify the retelling of encounters with the holy ones in a glossolalia. Such actions could lead to an official rebuke from the priest, or even a beating, called a ''chwat'', from one’s local community.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, Nancy (2005), “Dreaming in Color: Anti-essentialism in Legio Maria Dream Narratives'', Journal of Religion in Africa 35, no. 2: 175&lt;/ref&gt;

The spirit also provide direction for the individuals in regard to spiritual discipline practices and outward garments.  While many AICs require adherents to exclusively wear white robes when worshipping, the Legio Maria church encourages adherents to listen for messages from angels in their dreams in regard to the color of robe they should wear.  Schwartz recounts the varied meanings of these dream inspired colours:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The spirit can lead Legios to acquire robes of yellow, a range of blues, purple, green, red, brown and other colours that are associated with various spiritual gifts and patron saints. Black is for ordained male priests (padri, pl. pate) and church mothers (madha, padri madhako, pl. mathe, pate mamon). Legio priests and church mothers wear black robes at requiem masses and at graveside services held in family compounds. At happier times, black prayer beads are worn or carried by church mothers and priests as a metonym of power and ordained status. A few non-ordained men and women said they had the black beads on their house altars because a dream had directed them to get the beads and pray with them at home. The dream-bestowed black beads were a source of quiet pride to these Legios.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, Nancy (2005), “Dreaming in Color: Anti-essentialism in Legio Maria Dream Narratives'', Journal of Religion in Africa 35, no. 2: 170&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It is through the spirit that the Legio Maria adherents can also receive direction for the more mundane decisions in life.

==Headquarters and Holy Site==
The Legio Maria headquarters and center is St. Joseph church of Got Kwer, in Suna Migori. It is referred to as “Calvary” by Legio Maria adherents. This village of about 600 is approximately 15&amp;nbsp;km west of the southwestern Kenya town of [[Migori]]. Baba Simeo Ondeto's tomb is in this church, and is viewable as a long, cloth-covered [[plinth]] with numerous devotional objects scattered around. Both are maintained by local community followers. Other major Legio Maria's most recognised places are Effeso Nzoia where Mama Maria's remains were buried; Kodero; Jerusalem Amoyo in Kadem; St. Teresa Kariobangi in Nairobi; St. Peter Manyatta in Kisumu.

==Continuity and Discontinuity with Christianity==
The Legio Maria of African Mission Church can be seen in both continuity and discontinuity with orthodox Christianity. While one of the main critiques of the Legio Maria Church from other Christians centres on the claim that Simeo Ondeto is the “Black Messiah,” there are many ways in which the Legio Maria are in continuity with the Catholic Church.

First, the Legio Maria church recognises salvation through Jesus Christ, the Son of God. The discontinuity with orthodox theology is that the Son of God has been incarnated in multiple contexts, rejecting the orthodox doctrine of Christ taking a human body and soul for eternity. As we have seen in the above research, none of these incarnations are considered exclusive; they only serve to reveal Christ to people of different contexts. All who are saved through any of these incarnations of Christ will worship God together in heaven. Thus, for the Legio Church, salvation is found through Christ, as revealed in their particular Messias Simeo Ondeto.

Second, the Legio Maria church recognises an active spiritual realm that needs to be dealt with to respond to evil and illness. It is God who gives gifts to people for spiritual healing, sometimes through the saints. The Legio specifically recognise the Catholic saints Catherine of Siena and Bernadette of Lourdes in regard to spiritual healing. The Saints Samson and Julian, and the angel Michael help to “guide Legios with gifts for exorcism and battling witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, Nancy (2005), “Dreaming in Color: Anti-essentialism in Legio Maria Dream Narratives'', Journal of Religion in Africa 35, no. 2: 171&lt;/ref&gt;  In seeking guidance from these holy ones they are in continuity with Catholic theology, but this theology is applied to traditional religious understandings of evil and illness.

As stated above, the Legio Maria church is also in continuity with the Catholic Church in its use of Catholic hymns and the Catholic mass.  Many Legio Maria communities still celebrate the Latin form of the mass.  In addition, original Legio songs are added that reinforce the particularity of the Legio Maria church.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, Nancy (2005), “Dreaming in Color: Anti-essentialism in Legio Maria Dream Narratives'', Journal of Religion in Africa 35, no. 2: 171&lt;/ref&gt;

Another sign of continuity with the Catholic Church is that the Legio Maria include a white Catholic priest, Father Philip Chefa, among their saints.  Serving at the Asumbi Roman Catholic mission station in the 1930s,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Chefa was said to have practiced a highly charismatic form of Catholicism that addressed his parishioners’ concerns. He had engaged in healing, exorcism, and the burning of paraphernalia associated with ‘witchcraft’ and indigenous spirit-possession. Chefa had treated people who later became Legios well. He had established a chapter of the Roman Catholic Legion of Mary for Luo in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, Nancy (2005), “Dreaming in Color: Anti-essentialism in Legio Maria Dream Narratives'', Journal of Religion in Africa 35, no. 2: 171&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Not only does the Legio Maria Church acknowledge the Catholic saints as their own, but they have included some European priests who worked in Africa among their cloud of saints.

* [[Richard Rodgers]] (1902–1979): American composer of the music for more than 900 songs and 40 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musicals, best known for his songwriting partnerships with the [[lyricist]]s [[Rodgers and Hart|Lorenz Hart]] and [[Rodgers and Hammerstein|Oscar Hammerstein II]].&lt;ref&gt;Rodgers' biographer William G Hyland states: "That Richard Rodgers would recall, at the very beginning of his memoirs, his great-grandmother's death and its religious significance for his family suggests his need to justify his own religious alienation. Richard became an atheist, and as a parent he resisted religious instruction for his children. According to his wife, Dorothy, he felt that religion was based on "fear" and contributed to "feelings of guilt." " ''Richard Rodgers'', Yale University Press 1998, {{ISBN|0-300-07115-9}}.

Then there was the theory of evolution – the teaching about which in schools was fought against in a courtroom in the USA and is still disbelieved by a majority of Americans, incredibly. There's also no mention of dinosaurs in the bible either. Perhaps it's not inspired by an all knowing being after all and is, after all, just a cracking good work of fiction?

We had a Christmas concert every year in which we sang Christmas songs, both secular and religious. Being the rebellious atheist I am, I would roll my eyes at the Jesus songs. When we did the song 'Oh Holy Night', I got all my friends in the choir to sing the words 'shining' and 'pining' in a diving, stretched-out descending note—kind of like a barbershop quartet would—and in the middle bridge, we would fall on our knees during the line 'fall on your knees' and drop out of sight. But when we actually performed the concert, we didn't want to humiliate the music teacher, so we did it the correct way. It reminds me that I've always been an instigator and ringleader. And even though I was the little atheist, I still love that song and the melody."

This '''list of bishops, seniors, and superintendents of Hamburg''' records the spiritual heads of the Lutheran church in [[Hamburg]]. Originally the Lutheran church in Hamburg formed a [[state church]] established by [[Johannes Bugenhagen]]'s [[Church Order (Lutheran)|church order]] on 15 May 1529, after most of Hamburg's burghers had adopted [[Lutheranism]] before. As state church it was governed in administrative matters by the [[Senate of Hamburg]] (city government) and the {{Interlanguage link multi|College of Chief Elders (Hamburg)|de|3=Kollegium der Oberalten|lt=Chief Elders}}, according to the law named the Long Recess of 1529.&lt;ref name="Albrecht Michaelsen"&gt;Tim Albrecht and Stephan Michaelsen, [http://www1.uni-hamburg.de/spaetmittelalter/Hamburg%20Spaetmittelalter/Hamburg-Wiki/themen/EntwicklungDesHamburgerStadtrechts.html ''Entwicklung des Hamburger Stadtrechts''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221005653/http://www1.uni-hamburg.de/spaetmittelalter/Hamburg%20Spaetmittelalter/Hamburg-Wiki/themen/EntwicklungDesHamburgerStadtrechts.html |date=2013-12-21 }}, retrieved on 14 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; At first the church order provided for [[superintendent (ecclesiastical)|superintendents]] as spiritual leaders. Since 1593 the spiritual leadership was wielded by a [[collegiality|collegial]] body, the [[Ministerium|Spiritual Ministerium]], with a [[Seniority|senior]] elected by its members, the [[Minister (Christianity)|ministers (pastors)]] of the parishes. Separation of Church and State started in 1860, with the last privileges of state patronage waived in 1919. The new church order of 1923 enfranchised the synodals to elect one of the five ''Hauptpastoren'' (i.e. principal or head [[pastor]]s) at the quintet of {{Interlanguage link multi|Head Churches (Hamburg)|de|3=Hamburger Hauptkirchen|lt=Hamburg's five ''Hauptkirchen''}} (principal or head churches) as senior.

After the putsch in the [[synod#Lutheran usage|synod]] of 1933 by conservative Lutherans the new hierarchical office of bishop was created, establishing episcopalism and doing away with synodal and [[Presbyterial church government|presbyterial polity]] and neglecting the traditional function of senior and spiritual ministerium. In 1934 through a second putsch by [[German Christians]], backed by secular Nazi authorities, one of their acolytes assumed the episcopate. After the British occupiers prompted the bishop's resignation in late 1945, the presbyterial and synodal constitution of 1923 was restored, however, retaining the title bishop, but stripped of any episcopal supremacy, and reestablishing the office of senior, then functioning as the bishop's deputy. Conservative Lutherans prevailed again reelecting their first bishop of 1933. In 1977 the Hamburg Church seized its independent existence and merged with three neighbouring church bodies, in 2012 another merger with two more church bodies followed. Spiritual leaders for the Hamburg region retained the title of bishop, however, the traditional Hamburg seniorate was ended in 1976.

"In Hamburg as in other cities, the parishes … had been not only church districts but also municipal political districts since the [[Middle Ages]]. They … formed four incorporated bodies ([[St. Peter's Church, Hamburg|Petri]], [[St. Nicholas' Church, Hamburg|Nikolai]], [[St. Catherine's Church, Hamburg|Katharinen]], [[St. James' Church, Hamburg|Jacobi]]) in which the “[[Allodial title|allodial]]” (property-owning) burghers and the heads of guilds - thus only a fraction of the male population - were entitled to vote. The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] brought with it a significant curtailment of the senate's governmental power."&lt;ref name="Postel 1998 341"&gt;Rainer Postel, "Hamburg at the Time of the Peace of Westphalia", in: ''1648, War and Peace in Europe'': 3 vols., Klaus Bussmann and Heinz Schilling (eds.), Münster in Westphalia: Veranstaltungsgesellschaft 350 Jahre Westfälischer Friede, 1998, (=Catalogue for the exhibition «1648: War and Peace in Europe» 24 October 1998-17 January 1999 in Münster in Westphalia and Osnabrück), vol.&amp;nbsp;1: 'Politics, Religion, Law, and Society', pp.&amp;nbsp;337–343, here p.&amp;nbsp;341. {{ISBN|3-88789-128-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "At about the same time, three deacons from each parish (twelve altogether), acting as “chief elders”,&lt;ref&gt;The Chief Elders of Hamburg (die Oberalten), supervised all religious endowments for the poor after the donations and revenues for the poor of all parishes were centralised in the central God's Chest (Gotteskasten). The then four parishes agreed to this centralisation stipulating in a contract with the senate on 29 September 1528 that the college of the chief elders (Kollegium der Oberalten) will be in charge of the endowments. The chief elders were also entitled to decide with the senate in all matters concerning the welfare and the concord of the city, and formed thus besides parliament and senate a third constitutive body (till 1860). Until today this body administers the endowments taken over then and donated to the Lutheran church since. Cf. [http://www.oberalte.de/ ''Die Oberalten''], retrieved on 21 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; took on the task of centralizing, administering, and uniformly distributing relief to the poor."&lt;ref name="Postel 1998 341"/&gt; Later the parishioners of [[St. Michaelis Church, Hamburg|St. Michael's Church]] in the [[Neustadt, Hamburg|New Town]], established as parish independent of St. Nicholas in 1647, were granted the same rights than the burghers in one of the four parishes in the [[Altstadt, Hamburg|Old Town]], and the same number or representatives. Together with the four above-mentioned churches St. Michael's forms until today the quintet of Hamburg's ''head churches''. "Beginning in 1685, there were thus fifteen chief elders: sixty deacons instead of forty-eight and 180 assembly members altogether, rather than 144. These structures existed into the nineteenth century, with each college recruiting new members from the next larger."&lt;ref name="Postel 1998 341"/&gt; Since Lutheran parishes and the collegial bodies staffed with their parishioners formed the constitutional bodies of Hamburg there was no easy way to open politics for non-Lutherans.

The superintendents were initially appointed by the senate. In 1593 the superintendency was given up and the pastors of the five urban congregations formed the spiritual [[ministerium]] (Geistliches Ministerium), collegially wielding spiritual leadership of the state church and electing from its midst one of the head pastors the senior as [[primus inter pares]] only.

In 1806 Hamburg turned into an independent sovereign [[city-state]], annexed to France 1811-1814, and reconstituted thereafter. Reforms started with granting citizenship to non-Lutherans, and the full emancipation of Calvinists, Catholics and Jews until 1849. Adherents to these faithes could then enter officialdom and parliament. In 1860 the new Constitution of Hamburg provided for a start in separating state and church.&lt;ref name="Hering 2008 163"&gt;Rainer Hering, „Bischofskirche zwischen «Führerprinzip» und Luthertum: Die Evangelisch-lutherische Kirche im Hamburgischen Staate und das «Dritte Reich»“, in: ''Kirchliche Zeitgeschichte (20.&amp;nbsp;Jahrhundert)'', Rainer Hering and Inge Mager (eds.), (=Hamburgische Kirchengeschichte in Aufsätzen: 5 parts; part&amp;nbsp;5 / =Arbeiten zur Kirchengeschichte Hamburgs; vol.&amp;nbsp;26), Hamburg: Hamburg Univ. Press, 2008, pp.&amp;nbsp;155–200, here p.&amp;nbsp;163. {{ISBN|978-3-937816-46-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than the senate directly governing and administering Lutheran church matters, separate bodies were developed.&lt;ref name="Hering 2008 163"/&gt; The chief elders lost their role as constitutional body within Hamburg's administration, but continued as a body of Lutheran charity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oberalte.de/ ''Die Oberalten''], retrieved on 21&amp;nbsp;January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The administration of the Lutheran state church was altered in order to become a body separate from the government. Only the Lutheran members within the senate formed a college in charge of confirming the acts passed by the synodals as well as the elections of various officeholders within the Church, such as the senior of Hamburg, pastors, synodals and even laymen in [[Presbytery (church polity)|presbyteries]].&lt;ref name="Hering 2008 163"/&gt; The Lutheran church established self-rule and in 1871 reconstituted as a [[Landeskirche|regional Protestant church body]] called {{Interlanguage link multi|Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Hamburgian State|de|3=Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche im Hamburgischen Staate}}.&lt;ref name="Hering 2008 163"/&gt;

The spiritual leadership remained with the spiritual ministerium with its senior. In March 1919 the Lutheran senators waived the senate's supreme governance ({{Interlanguage link multi|summepiscopacy|de|3=Landesherrliches Kirchenregiment}}; like the [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England|royal supreme governance of the Church of England]]), the privilege to confirm elected seniors and taken synodal decisions.&lt;ref name="Hering 2008 163"/&gt; The Lutheran Church in the Hamburg State accounted for this change and adopted a democratised constitution in 1923.&lt;ref name="Hering 2008 163"/&gt; The synod was now the highest legislator of the church, electing the church council (Kirchenrat), the executive, including the senior as its [[ex officio member]].&lt;ref name="Hering 2008 164"&gt;Rainer Hering, „Bischofskirche zwischen «Führerprinzip» und Luthertum: Die Evangelisch-lutherische Kirche im Hamburgischen Staate und das «Dritte Reich»“, in: ''Kirchliche Zeitgeschichte (20.&amp;nbsp;Jahrhundert)'', Rainer Hering and Inge Mager (eds.), (=Hamburgische Kirchengeschichte in Aufsätzen: 5 parts; part&amp;nbsp;5 / =Arbeiten zur Kirchengeschichte Hamburgs; vol.&amp;nbsp;26), Hamburg: Hamburg Univ. Press, 2008, pp.&amp;nbsp;155–200, here p.&amp;nbsp;164. {{ISBN|978-3-937816-46-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The senior again was still to be elected from the five head pastors, but not by the members of the spiritual ministerium, but by the synod.&lt;ref name="Hering 2008 164"/&gt; The spiritual ministerium, comprising all the Lutheran clergy, with many more than the five head churches and parishes being established in the 19th century, was redefined as a mere advisory and reviewing body.&lt;ref name="Hering 2008 164"/&gt;

With the introduction of the general and equal suffrage also for women and people with no or only low incomes in Hamburg in 1919 also the Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Hamburgian State established equal suffrage in presbyterial and synodal elections by an emergency ordinance in 1919 and its revised constitution in 1923.

After Hindenburg's suspension of central [[Weimar Constitution]]al civil liberties, followed by the Nazi takeover on the Reich's level and with its [[Enabling Act of 1933|Empowerment Act]] de facto doing away with state autonomy the last democratic senate was deposed, and the Hamburg parliament restaffed disregarding Hamburg's state election outcome but mirroring the rather Nazi-preferential allocation of seats realised on the Reich's level. This atmosphere of hunting democratic witches encouraged antirepublican Nazi-submissive synodals affiliated with the so-called ''[[German Christians]]'' and conservative antiliberal synodals of the so-called {{Interlanguage link multi|Young-Reformatory Movement|de|3=Jungreformatorische Bewegung}},&lt;ref&gt;So Hamburg's Young-Reformatory Movement, like elsewhere in Germany, welcomed the Nazi takeover, but unlike their fellow organisations in other regional Protestant church bodies, it helped create [[fait accompli|faits accomplis]] with the putsch, so that the movement had deprived itself of any way out once it realised the destructiveness of Nazism. In the [[Prussian Union of churches|Old-Prussian Church]] the Young-Reformatory Movement joined the [[Confessing Church]], whereas in Hamburg it dropped into the irrelevant role as the former stirrup holders of the Nazi-submissive new church leader.&lt;/ref&gt; led by [[Bernhard Heinrich Forck]], to form a new majority in Hamburg's synod imposing a putsch within the church's bodies.&lt;ref name="Hering 2008 168seq"&gt;Rainer Hering, „Bischofskirche zwischen «Führerprinzip» und Luthertum: Die Evangelisch-lutherische Kirche im Hamburgischen Staate und das «Dritte Reich»“, in: ''Kirchliche Zeitgeschichte (20.&amp;nbsp;Jahrhundert)'', Rainer Hering and Inge Mager (eds.), (=Hamburgische Kirchengeschichte in Aufsätzen: 5 parts; part&amp;nbsp;5 / =Arbeiten zur Kirchengeschichte Hamburgs; vol.&amp;nbsp;26), Hamburg: Hamburg Univ. Press, 2008, pp.&amp;nbsp;155–200, here pp.&amp;nbsp;168seq. {{ISBN|978-3-937816-46-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The incumbent Senior [[Karl Albert Ernst Friedrich Theodor Horn|Karl Horn]] was forced into resignation and an extraordinary synod convened.&lt;ref name="Hering 2008 168"&gt;Rainer Hering, „Bischofskirche zwischen «Führerprinzip» und Luthertum: Die Evangelisch-lutherische Kirche im Hamburgischen Staate und das «Dritte Reich»“, in: ''Kirchliche Zeitgeschichte (20.&amp;nbsp;Jahrhundert)'', Rainer Hering and Inge Mager (eds.), (=Hamburgische Kirchengeschichte in Aufsätzen: 5 parts; part&amp;nbsp;5 / =Arbeiten zur Kirchengeschichte Hamburgs; vol.&amp;nbsp;26), Hamburg: Hamburg Univ. Press, 2008, pp.&amp;nbsp;155–200, here p.&amp;nbsp;168. {{ISBN|978-3-937816-46-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 May 1933 this synod established the new function of a state bishop ([[Landesbischof]]) with hierarchic supremacy over all the clergy following the Nazi [[Führerprinzip]], thus doing away with collegiality in church bodies, and empowered the new state bishop {{Interlanguage link multi|Simon Schöffel|de}} to rule discretionarily without the synod, abolishing the previously practised synodal and presbyterial polity in Hamburg's church.&lt;ref&gt;Rainer Hering, „Bischofskirche zwischen «Führerprinzip» und Luthertum: Die Evangelisch-lutherische Kirche im Hamburgischen Staate und das «Dritte Reich»“, in: ''Kirchliche Zeitgeschichte (20.&amp;nbsp;Jahrhundert)'', Rainer Hering and Inge Mager (eds.), (=Hamburgische Kirchengeschichte in Aufsätzen: 5 parts; part&amp;nbsp;5 / =Arbeiten zur Kirchengeschichte Hamburgs; vol.&amp;nbsp;26), Hamburg: Hamburg Univ. Press, 2008, pp.&amp;nbsp;155–200, here footnote&amp;nbsp;30 on p.&amp;nbsp;168. {{ISBN|978-3-937816-46-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This putsch turned Hamburg's church into a streamlined church body subjected to a state bishop obedient to the new Nazi regime and open for any experiment as to domesticating Protestantism for the Nazi purpose.&lt;ref name="Hering 2008 170"&gt;Rainer Hering, „Bischofskirche zwischen «Führerprinzip» und Luthertum: Die Evangelisch-lutherische Kirche im Hamburgischen Staate und das «Dritte Reich»“, in: ''Kirchliche Zeitgeschichte (20.&amp;nbsp;Jahrhundert)'', Rainer Hering and Inge Mager (eds.), (=Hamburgische Kirchengeschichte in Aufsätzen: 5 parts; part&amp;nbsp;5 / =Arbeiten zur Kirchengeschichte Hamburgs; vol.&amp;nbsp;26), Hamburg: Hamburg Univ. Press, 2008, pp.&amp;nbsp;155–200, here p.&amp;nbsp;170. {{ISBN|978-3-937816-46-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

So when Hitler's government imposed an unconstitutional premature reelection of all presbyters (elders) and the synod for 23 July 1933 – also in the other regional Protestant church bodies in Germany – the so-called ''German Christians'' and the ''Kirchenpartei''&lt;ref&gt;A Kirchenpartei (church party) in German Protestantism is a group nominating candidates in a list for church council and synodal elections and compares roughly to [[nominating group]]s in the Church of Sweden.&lt;/ref&gt; {{Interlanguage link multi|Gospel and Church|de|3=Evangelium und Kirche}} (a merger including the Young-Reformatory Movement, dominated by the latter's proponents) presented the Lutheran Hamburg electorate united lists of candidates for the synod and all presbyteries, each staffed with 51% ''German Christians'' and 49% proponents of ''Gospel and Church''.&lt;ref name="Hering 2008 170"/&gt; So in Hamburg the election of synod and presbyteries turned into a sheer farce. So these united lists attracted the traditionally fragmented rightist faction within the Lutheran electorate, but granted the so-called ''German Christians'' a share in the seats far exceeding their proportion among Lutheran parishioners.&lt;ref name="Hering 2008 170"/&gt; Nazi government-funded propaganda mobilised previously inactive church members adhering to Nazism to vote for the united lists, causing a very high turnout of voters unheard of in earlier church elections. So the candidates of the united lists gained the majority in the synod and in most presbyteries.

Opposition developed, called the [[Confessing Church]], and its adherents considered the Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Hamburgian State to be a so-called ''destroyed church'' for having no unadulterated bodies and leadership anymore and thus not deserving the compliance of the opposing parishioners and clergy. Leading members of the confessing church in Hamburg, such as Forck and {{Interlanguage link multi|Theodor Knolle|de}}, had earlier themselves participated in the putsch streamlining their church. The ''German Christians'' radicalised during the 1930s so that Schöffel, himself a putschist, was forced to resign again in early March 1934. On 5 March {{Interlanguage link multi|Franz Tügel|de}} succeeded.

With the defeat of Germany and its Nazi government the Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Hamburgian State returned to its pre-1933 constitution, only reluctantly cleansing its staff and bodies from few of the most extreme proponents of the ''German Christians''. However, its spiritual leaders continued to be titled bishop. With effect of 1 January 1977 the Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Hamburgian State merged with three neighbouring Lutheran churches in the new [[North Elbian Evangelical Lutheran Church]], which - consisting of three spiritual ambits ({{Interlanguage link multi|Diocese (Lutheran)|de|3=Sprengel (evangelisch)|lt=Lutheran diocese}}) – upheld the function of bishop of Hamburg until 2008. Since the episcopal ambits have been redrawn, with Hamburg being part of the new ambit called ''Hamburg and Lübeck'' including also parts of southeastern Holstein and [[Lübeck]], but seated in Hamburg. This ambit structure continued also after the North Elbian Church merged with two neighbouring churches in the new [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Northern Germany]] (abbr.: Northern Church)

== Titles of the spiritual leaders of the Lutheran church in Hamburg==
Titles and ambits of the incumbents altered. The respective incumbents of the spiritual leadership held the following titles and ambits :
* [[superintendent (ecclesiastical)|Superintendent]] of Hamburg in its respective political borders from 1532–1593
* Spiritual Ministerium, collegially with its senior as [[primus inter pares]], for Hamburg in its respective political borders 1593–1933
* State Bishop ([[Landesbischof]]) of Hamburg in its political borders of 1936, from 1933 to 1976
* Bishop of the Hamburg Ambit, comprising the city-state in its political borders of 1937 and some congregations in its eastern vicinity, within the North Elbian Evangelical Lutheran Church from 1977 to 2008
* Bishop of the Hamburg and Lübeck Ambit, comprising the city-state and some congregations in its western and northern vicinity and all the congregations in southeastern Holstein including Lübeck, within the North Elbian Evangelical Lutheran Church from 2008 to 2012 
* Bishop of the Hamburg and Lübeck Ambit, as mentioned above, within the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Northern Germany since 27 May 2012

The [[Aryan paragraph]] was never made church law, but the church provided no mercy let alone protection for Lutherans, who - not protected by mixed marriages - were to be deported to ghettos and extermination camps in the east due to their Jewish descent, let alone speaking up for unbaptised people of Jewish faith. Since 1935 Tügel ejected the quarrelling and thus increasingly unpopular ''German Christians'' from using church property for free, speeding their fading and financial collapse. The [[Control Commission for Germany - British Element|Control Commission for Germany - British Element (CCG/BE)]] forced the completely undiscerning Tügel into resignation on 18 July 1945.

He falsified the history, claiming that not he headed the putschist movement of 1933 which established the autocratic episcopacy in Hamburg's Church empowered to legislate without synod, but pretended it were introduced by his successor Tügel in 1934 only. Schöffel did silence over his Nazi collaboration, but not over Nazi crimes which he blatantly qualified as less bad than the suffering of Germans under the Allies.

'''Marie Catherine Laveau''' (September 10, 1801– June 15, 1881)&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Marie Laveau The Mysterious Voudou Queen: A Study of Powerful Female Leadership in Nineteenth- Century New Orleans by Ina Johanna Fandrich&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=nb|name=birthdate|As for the date of her birth, while popular sources often say 1794, the records indicate 1801.&lt;ref name="Martha L."&gt;{{cite book|last1=Loustaunau|first1=Martha, Denmke|title=Marie Laveau|publisher=Salem Press Enclycopedia|page=1|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/eds/detail/detail?sid=d4c8234b-43e6-4049-8671-f99ff5cdb395%40sessionmgr4003&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=4111&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#db=ers&amp;AN=89098919|accessdate=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} was a [[Louisiana Creole people|Louisiana Creole]]  practitioner of [[Louisiana Voodoo|Voodoo]], who was renowned in [[New Orleans]]. Her daughter, Marie Laveau II, (1827&amp;nbsp;— c. 1862) also practiced rootwork, conjure, Native American and African spiritualism as well as Louisiana or what is known today as New Orleans Voodoo.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nola.com/300/2018/02/marie_laveau_voodoo_queen_of_n.html|title=Marie Laveau: Separating fact from fiction about New Orleans' Voodoo queen|work=NOLA.com|access-date=2018-07-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Historical records surmise that Marie Laveau was born free in the [[French Quarter]] of [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], Thursday September 10, 1801. She was the biological daughter of Marguerite Henry (also known as Marguerite D'Arcantel), a free woman of colour who was of Native American, African and French descent, and [[Charles Trudeau (politician)|Charles Laveau Trudeau]], surveyor &amp; politician.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lahistory.org/resources/dictionary-louisiana-biography/dictionary-louisiana-biography-l/|title=Dictionary of Louisiana Biography - L - Louisiana Historical Association|website=www.lahistory.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 4, 1819, she married Jacques Paris (also known as Jacques Santiago, in other records), a French immigrant who had fled as a white refugee from the black [[Haitian Revolution]] in the former French territory Saint-Domingue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/1572-the-marie-laveau-phenomenon.html|title=The Marie Laveau Phenomenon|last=Vitelli|first=Dr. Romeo|website=archive.randi.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their marriage certificate is preserved in the [[St. Louis Cathedral, New Orleans|St. Louis Cathedral]] in New Orleans.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.womenhistoryblog.com/2012/07/marie-laveau.html|title=Marie Laveau {{!}} History of American Women|date=2012-07-01|work=History of American Women|access-date=2018-07-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wedding [[mass (liturgy)|mass]] was performed by Father [[Antonio de Sedella]], the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] priest known as Pere Antoine.&lt;ref name="Tallant, Robert 1946"/&gt;

The death of Jacques Paris was recorded in 1820.&lt;ref name="Martha L." /&gt; He was part of a large French immigration of refugees to New Orleans in 1809, after the [[Haitian Revolution]] of 1791-1804.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They had two daughters, Felicite in 1817 and Angele in 1820. Both disappear from the records in the 1820s.

==Personal life==
Little is known with certainty about the life of Marie Catherine Laveau. Marie Catherine (1801-1881) was approximately 1/3 each African, Native American and white.&lt;ref name="Tallant, Robert 1946" /&gt; Laveau's only two children to survive into adulthood were daughters. The elder named Marie Euchariste Eloise Laveau  (1827-1860-2), the second daughter was named Marie Philomene Glapion (1836-1897).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It is not known which of these daughters went on to become Marie II.

Following the reported death of her husband, she entered a domestic partnership with [[Christophe Dominick Duminy de Glapion]], (a white man of French descent) with whom she lived until his death in 1855.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/1572-the-marie-laveau-phenomenon.html|title=The Marie Laveau Phenomenon|last=Vitelli|first=Dr. Romeo|website=archive.randi.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were reported to have had 15 children (or, perhaps fifteen children ''and grandchildren'').&lt;ref&gt;Ward, Martha. ''Voodoo Queen: The Spirited Lives of Marie Laveau'' (Jackson: University Press of Mississippi, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; They had 7 children according to birth and baptismal records.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/70292161|title=A New Orleans voudou priestess : the legend and reality of Marie Laveau|last=Morrow.|first=Long, Carolyn|date=2006|publisher=University Press of Florida|isbn=0813029740|location=Gainesville|oclc=70292161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
While it is difficult to determine the histories of the two Maries in tradition, it is believed that the elder Marie was a dedicated practitioner of Voodoo. The younger displayed more theatrical rubrics by holding public events (including inviting attendees to [[St. John's Eve]] rituals on [[Bayou St. John]]).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; "Laveau was said to have traveled the streets like she owned them" said one New Orleans boy who attended an event at St.John's.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Creole, The History and Legacy of Louisiana's Free People of Color|last = Duggal|first = Barbra Rosendale|publisher = Louisiana State University Press|year = 2000|isbn = |location = Baton Rouge|pages = 157–178}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known which (if either) had done more to establish the voodoo queen reputation.&lt;ref name= "Tallant, Robert 1946"&gt;{{cite book | last = Tallant | first = Robert | year = 1946 | title = Voodoo in New Orleans (1984 reprint) | publisher = Macmillan Company - reprint Pelican Publishing | place = New York | ISBN = 978-0-88289-336-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marie Laveau I started a beauty parlor where she was a hair-dresser for the wealthier families of [[New Orleans]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Of Laveau's [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] career, there is little that can be substantiated, including whether or not she had a snake she named Zombi after [[Zombi (African god)|an African god]], whether the [[occult]] part of her magic mixed [[Roman Catholic]] [[saint]]s with African spirits, or whether her divinations were supported by a network of informants she developed while working as a hairdresser in prominent white households. She appeared to excel at obtaining inside information on her wealthy patrons by instilling fear in their servants whom she either paid or cured of mysterious ailments.&lt;ref name="Tallant, Robert 1946" /&gt;

==Death==
[[File:MarieLaveauGrave.jpg|thumb|right|Plaque at the grave of [[Louisiana Voodoo]] Queen, Marie Laveau]]
On June 17, 1881, it was announced in the ''Daily Picayune'' that Marie Laveau had died peacefully in her home.&lt;ref name="Tallant, Robert 1946" /&gt; However, oral tradition states that she was seen by some people in town after her supposed demise.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; One of her daughters, also named Marie (a French Catholic tradition to have the first names of daughters be Marie, and boys Joseph, then each use middle name as common name) possibly assumed her position, with her name, and carried on her magical practice, taking over as the queen soon before or after the first Marie's death.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Marie Catherine Laveau Paris Glapion died on June 15, 1881, aged 79.&lt;ref&gt;Long, Carolyn Morrow. ''A New Orleans Voudou Priestess: The Legend and Reality of Marie Laveau'', Gainesville: University Press of Florida (2006), ({{ISBN|9780813029740}}).&lt;/ref&gt; The different spellings of her surname result from many different women with the same name in New Orleans at the time, and her age at death from conflicting accounts of her birth date.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Legacy==

Laveau's name and her history have been surrounded by legend and lore. In 1982, New Jersey-based punk rock group [[Misfits (band)|The Misfits]] were arrested and accused of attempting to exhume Laveau from her grave after a local concert. The arrest took place in nearby Cemetery No. 2 and there are conflicting accounts of the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/haunted/index.ssf/2013/10/when_the_misfits_got_arrested.html|title=When the Misfits got arrested in a New Orleans cemetery: a 1982 story from our crypt|publisher=|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marie Laveau is generally believed to have been buried in plot 347, the Glapion family crypt in [[Saint Louis Cemetery#Saint Louis No. 1|Saint Louis Cemetery No. 1]], New Orleans,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://virtualglobetrotting.com/map/voodoo-queen-marie-laveaus-tomb/view/google/|title=Voodoo Queen Marie Laveau's tomb in New Orleans, LA (Google Maps)|date=2014-09-10|work=Virtual Globetrotting|access-date=2018-07-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this has been disputed&lt;ref name="notp-2013-12-30"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nola.com/crime/index.ssf/2013/12/repair_of_marie_laveaus_tomb_t.html|title=Repair of Marie Laveau's tomb to take months, potential suspect attempted to paint another tomb one month ago|last=Webster|first=Richard A.|date=December 30, 2013|newspaper=[[The New Orleans Times-Picayune]]|quote=Angie Green, executive director of Save Our Cemeteries, a non-profit that works to preserve historic cemeteries throughout the city, said she doesn't know "for sure" who is responsible for painting the vault but has a prime suspect in mind. Two weeks earlier, Green said she caught a young, clean-cut man in his early 20s painting a tomb in the back of the cemetery a "creamish, yellowish, beige." The tomb, like Laveau's, was covered in hundreds of Xs drawn on its surface by tourists. Decades ago, someone started a rumor that if people wanted Laveau to grant them a wish, they had to draw an X on the tomb, turn around three times, knock on the tomb, yell out their wish, and if it was granted, come back, circle their X, and leave Laveau an offering, said tour guide Renee Dodge. Over the years the practice spread to several other tombs in the cemetery including the one the young man was attempting to paint over two weeks before Laveau's tomb was vandalized. Green said she called the police but declined to press charges. "I didn't think he was a threat. I spoke with him and it seemed he thought he was trying to do the right thing (by covering up the Xs)," Green said. "The police said he was someone they knew, a homeless, mentally unstable kid. So we are pretty sure it was him (who painted Laveau's tomb) but no one knows for sure."  ....  There are even questions whether the now pink tomb in St. Louis No. 1 is actually the burial site of Laveau. The person who married into the Glapion family that owns the tomb but there is no hard evidence that is where she was buried, Green said. "I've heard strong arguments for the tomb in (St. Louis) No. 1 or multiple tombs in (St. Louis) No 2," she said.|accessdate=2014-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Robert Tallant, a journalist who used her as a character in historical novels.&lt;ref name="Tallant, Robert 1946"/&gt; Tourists continue to visit and some draw X marks in accordance with a decades-old tradition that if people wanted Laveau to grant them a wish, they had to draw an X on the tomb, turn around three times, knock on the tomb, yell out their wish, and if it was granted, come back, circle their X, and leave Laveau an offering.&lt;ref name="notp-2013-12-30" /&gt;

The tomb in Saint Louis Cemetery No. 1 was vandalized by an unknown person on December 17, 2013, by being painted over with pink [[latex paint]]. The paint was removed because the structure is made of old plaster and the latex paint would seal in moisture that would destroy the plaster. Some historical preservation experts criticized the decision by officials of the [[Archdiocese of New Orleans]], who maintain the cemetery, for their decision to use pressure washing rather than paint stripper to remove it.&lt;ref name="notp=2014-01-02"&gt;{{cite news

| quote = But when Angie Green, executive director of Save Our Cemeteries, a nonprofit group that works to preserve historic cemeteries throughout the city, saw someone blasting Laveau's tomb with a high-pressure water gun she said she immediately called the Archdiocese. "Pressure washing is terrible for any old building," Green said. "When I first saw them doing it they had two sides done and there were chips of brick and plaster from the tomb all over the ground. I asked them to stop and everyone (at the Archdiocese) said they would stop but they are still doing it." [Sarah McDonald, director of communications for the Archdiocese,] said Green's allegation that the pressure washing is inflicting significant damage is "inaccurate."

&lt;/ref&gt;

As of March 1, 2015, there is no longer public access to St. Louis Cemetery No. 1. Entry with a tour guide is required because of continued vandalism and destruction of tombs. This change was made by the Archdiocese of New Orleans to protect the tombs of the Laveau family as well as those of the many other dead interred there.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Although some references to Marie Laveau in popular culture refer to her as a "witch," she is properly described as a '[[Louisiana Voodoo#Voodoo queens|Voodoo queen]]'.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==Artistic legacy==

Because of her prominence within the history of Voodoo in New Orleans, Laveau has inspired a number of artistic renditions.

In visual art, the African American artist [[Renee Stout]] often uses Laveau as a visual motif.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = North| first = Bill| title = ...to build up a rich collection...:Selected Works From the Marianna Kistler Beach Museum of Art| publisher = [[Marianna Kistler Beach Museum of Art]]| isbn = 1-890751-11-1| page = 110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous songs about Marie Laveau have been recorded, including "Marie La Veau" by [[Papa Celestin]], "[[Marie Laveau (song)|Marie Laveau]]" written by [[Shel Silverstein]] and Baxter Taylor and recorded by [[Dr. Hook &amp; the Medicine Show]] (1972), and [[Bobby Bare]] (1974), "[[The Witch Queen of New Orleans]]" (1971) by [[Redbone (band)|Redbone]], "Dixie Drug Store" by [[Grant Lee Buffalo]], "X Marks the Spot (Marie Laveau)" by [[Joe Sample]], "Marie Laveau" by [[Dr. John]], "Marie Laveau" (2013) by [https://www.domomusicgroup.com/taoofsound/ Tao Of Sound], "Voodoo Queen Marie" to the minstrel tune "Colored Aristocracy" by [[The Holy Modal Rounders]], "The Witch Queen of New Orleans" by Total Toly, and "The Widow Paris" by [[The Get Up Kids]].   Most recently the Danish metal band [[Volbeat]] released an album with a song entitled "Marie Laveau" (''Seal The Deal &amp; Let's Boogie'', 2016). Marie Laveau is mentioned in the song "I Will Play for Gumbo" (1999) by [[Jimmy Buffett]] and “Clare” by The Fairground Attraction. Two of Laveau's nephews, banjoist Raymond Glapion and bassist [[Alcide Pavageau|Alcide "Slow Drag" Pavageau]], became prominent New Orleans jazz musicians.&lt;ref name = "rose"&gt;{{cite book|last = Rose |first = Al |title = I Remember Jazz: Six Decades Among the Great Jazzmen | location = Baton Rouge and London |publisher = LSU Press | pages = 7 | date = 1987 |isbn = 0-8071-2571-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laveau has offered inspiration for a number of fictional characters as well.

She is the protagonist of such novels as Robert Tallant's ''The Voodoo Queen'' (1956), [[Francine Prose]]'s eponymous ''Marie Laveau'' (1977), and [[Jewell Parker Rhodes]]' ''Voodoo Dreams: A Novel of Marie Laveau'' (1993). Laveau appears as a supporting character in the Night Huntress novels by [[Jeaniene Frost]], as a powerful ghoul still living in New Orleans in the 21st century. She also appears as a background character in [[Barbara Hambly|Barbara Hambly's]] Benjamin January mystery series, set in New Orleans. Marie Laveau appears in [[Neil Gaiman]]'s novel ''[[American Gods]]'', under her married name, Marie Paris. Marie Laveau's tomb is the site of a secret, fictional underground Voodoo workshop in the Caster Chronicles novel ''[[Beautiful Chaos (Garcia and Stohl novel)|Beautiful Chaos]]'' by Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl. Laveau's grave site is the setting of a pivotal scene in [[Robert J. Randisi]]'s short story, "Cold As The Gun,",\ from ''Foreshadows: The Ghosts of Zero''. The mother of [[Hazel Levesque]], one of the characters from [[Rick Riordan]]'s ''[[The Heroes of Olympus]]'' book series, was known as "Queen Marie," a famous fortune teller who lived in New Orleans. In Charlaine Harris' "True Blood" (Sookie Stackhouse novels) book series, the character Hadley is lured to her death at the site of Marie Laveau's tomb.

A character named Marie Laveau, based loosely on the real Marie Laveau, appears in [[Marvel Comics]].  She first appeared in [[Dracula Lives#Dracula Lives.21|''Dracula Lives'' #2]] in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://marvel.com/universe/Laveau,_Marie | title =Laveau, Marie – Marvel Universe Wiki: The definitive online source for Marvel super hero bios}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is depicted as a powerful sorceress and Voodoo priestess with great magical powers and knowledge of arcane lore, including the creation of a potion made from vampire's blood that keeps her eternally youthful and beautiful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marvel Universe Appendix - Marie Laveau|url=http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/laveau.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; A character named Marie Laveau also appears in the Italian comic book ''[[Zagor]]''.

In TV, a heavily fictionalized Marie Laveau (portrayed by [[Angela Bassett]]) appears as a character in ''[[American Horror Story: Coven]]'' and [[American Horror Story: Apocalypse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/tv/index.ssf/2013/08/fxs_john_landgraf_on_american.html|title=FX's John Landgraf on 'American Horror Story: Coven:' 'It's really funny this year'|publisher=|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also appears in the Canadian television series ''[[Lost Girl]]'' in episode 11 of season 4 and in the series [[Young Sheldon]] in episode 6 of season 1.

'''''Metamorpheus''''' is [[Steve Hackett]]'s 17th studio album. This classical album is the successor to ''A Midsummer Nights Dream''. ''Metamorpheus'' is an expression on Orpheus and his passage through the Underworld. The use of the nylon guitar and the ''Underground Orchestra'' naturally gives a link between the small and big moments of this album.

The cover of the album was created by [[Kim Poor]], the picture on the sleeves of the previous album ''To Watch The Storms'' also features the song "Rebecca".

This album makes use of themes first used by Hackett in short pieces (only released as free MP3 downloads) for the soundtrack of the 2001 [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] documentary ''Outwitting Hitler''.

'''Michel Déon''' ({{IPA-fr|deɔ̃|lang}}; 4 August 1919 – 28 December 2016) was a French novelist and literary columnist. He published over 50 works and was the recipient of numerous awards, including the [[Prix Interallié]] for his 1970 novel, ''[[Les Poneys sauvages]]'' (The Wild Ponies). Déon's 1973 novel ''[[Un taxi mauve]]'' received the [[Grand Prix du roman de l'Académie française]]. His novels have been translated into numerous languages.

He is considered to have been one of the most innovative French writers of the 20th century. In 1978, Déon was elected to the [[Académie française]].

==Early years==
Michel Déon was born in Paris on 4 August 1919, the only child of a civil servant and his wife. His father took his family along on the many foreign trips his work required, stimulating his son's interest in travel and cross-cultural relations that came to define his writings. Déon's father died in 1933 while on assignment in [[Monaco]] serving as advisor to Prince Louis. He and his mother returned to Paris, where Déon attended the [[Lycée Janson-de-Sailly]]. Although he was passionate about literature and journalism, Déon acquiesced to familial pressure and studied law in college.

Born a year after the end of World War I, he adopted the pacifism popular with many others of his generation. When drafted into the French military, he was assigned to the 152nd regiment under General [[Jean de Lattre de Tassigny|de Lattre]] and served alongside [[Charles Maurras]], a member of the Académie française since 1938. He joined Maurras in championing [[Action Française]], a counter-revolutionary, monarchist political movement. Maurras instilled in him an intense distaste for both democracy and fascism. Déon says that freedom is his highest value, both in life and for the individual.

==Career==
At the end of World War II, Déon returned to Paris to dedicate himself to a literary career. He first worked for a series of small-press French newspapers to support himself while drafting a novel and short stories. His first collection of short stories, ''Adieux à Sheila'', was published in 1944.

Shortly after his first publication, Déon received a [[Rockefeller Foundation]] grant that supported his travels through the United States. While there, Déon worked alongside [[William Faulkner]] and [[Saul Bellow]]. Their collaboration proved beneficial for all three of them and Déon assisted Bellow in translating his works into French.

Alongside such contemporary French writers as [[Jacques Laurent]], [[Antoine Blondin]], and [[Roger Nimier]], Déon staunchly opposed the [[existentialism]] of [[Sartre]] and other prominent cultural figures. Déon and his fellow authors became known as [[Hussards (literary movement)|Les Hussards]], named after Nimier's novel ''[[The Blue Hussar]]''. They were recognized for their innovative unconventionality, sympathy for the bizarre underdog, and pervasive refusal to adopt fashionable themes and tone.

In 1944, [[Roland Laudenbach]] and [[Jean Cocteau]] founded [[Éditions de la Table ronde]] (Round Table Publishing), a publishing enterprise that published works by many members of ''Les Hussards''. Table ronde published several of Déon's novels, including ''Les Gens de la Nuit'', ''La Carotte et le Bâton'', and ''Tout L'Amour du Monde II''. After Table ronde became a subsidiary of [[Éditions Gallimard]] around 1970, Gallimard published more than twenty of Déon's works.

In 1970, Déon's novel ''[[Les Poneys sauvages]]'' (''The Wild Ponies'') was awarded the [[Prix Interallié]], given annually since 1930 to the best novel written by a journalist.

Déon wrote his critical masterpiece ''[[Un taxi mauve]]'' (''A Purple Taxi'') in 1973. It became an immediate literary sensation and won the [[Grand Prix du Roman de l'Académie française]].&lt;ref name=AF&gt;{{cite web|title=Michel Déon|url=http://academie-francaise.fr/les-immortels/michel-deon|website=http://academie-francaise.fr|publisher=Académie française|accessdate=6 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Un Taxi Mauve'' was made into a film in 1977. The following year, 1978, Déon was elected to the Académie française.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Krebs|first1=Albin|title=Notes on People|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1978/06/09/110860257.pdf|accessdate=18 June 2014|work=New York Times|date=9 June 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his numerous individual works and awards, Déon has collaborated with several public figures. In 1953, he assisted [[Coco Chanel]] in writing her autobiography, though she refused to have it published. Déon destroyed the only existing copy for the sake of his friendship with her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rizzo|first1=Willy|title=Michel Deon Raconte Chanel|url=http://www.parismatch.com/Actu/Societe/Michel-Deon-raconte-Chanel-137512|accessdate=6 September 2014|work=Paris Match|date=31 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, Déon worked with [[Salvador Dalí]] on the artist's memoirs, ''Diary of a Genius''.

==Personal life==
Much of Déon's work engages his experience via travel to such locations as Switzerland, Italy, Canada, and Portugal. During the 1940s, he explored the United States by [[Greyhound Bus]].

Déon is an affiliate member of the [[Academia das Ciências de Lisboa, Classe de Letras|Portuguese Academy of Science and Letters]]. He is a doctor ''honoris causa'' at the universities of Athens and Ireland. He is also an honorary citizen of [[Nice]], [[Aix-en-Provence]], and [[Antibes]]. His works have been translated into many languages.

Déon and his wife Chantal raised their two children, Alice and Alexandre, on the small Greek island of [[Spetsai]]. When the children reached school age in 1968, [[May 1968 events in France|France was in a state of upheaval]]. The Déon family settled in Ireland. For over forty years, Déon and his family have made Ireland their home, raising Chantal's fifty horses. There Déon wrote on his [[Louis XVI style|Louis XVI]] desk. He visited France frequently.

Déon died from a [[pulmonary embolism]] at the age of 97 on 28 December 2016 in [[Galway]], Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/french-writer-michel-d%C3%A9on-dies-in-galway-aged-97-1.2919665 |title=French writer Michel Déon dies in Galway, aged 97 |publisher=The Irish Times |date=2016-12-28|accessdate=2016-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=death&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leprogres.fr/france-monde/2016/12/28/l-academicien-michel-deon-est-decede |language=French |title=L'académicien Michel Déon est décédé |work=Le Progrès |date= 28 December 2016 |accessdate= 28 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Novels==
''Les Poneys Sauvages'' (1970) is a story of murder, intrigue, and revenge. It begins in 1937, as George, Barry, Cyril, and Horace, students of varying backgrounds, complete their educations at the [[University of Cambridge]]. As the decade ends, the group becomes tangled in the Second World War. Those who survive the war take the reader on a journey that spans three decades and covers all of Europe, from Italy to Poland and back to Paris. As the friends age, they learn that the past is not forgotten quickly. In 1981, it was the basis of a six-part television series that starred [[Hélène Vincent]].

''Un Taxi Mauve'' (1973) follows a group of troubled European and American expatriates who have settled in rural Ireland – each for his own reason. Living in a self-punishing exile, their interactions create a tangle of love and deceit. An English-language film based on the novel, released in 1977 and called ''[[The Purple Taxi]]'' in English, starred [[Fred Astaire]], [[Charlotte Rampling]], and [[Philippe Noiret]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Canby|first1=Vincent |title=1977 ''Purple Taxi'' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/19/movies/1977-purple-taxi.html|accessdate=18 June 2014|work=New York Times|date=19 February 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Foundling Boy]]'' (''Le Jeune Homme Vert'') (1975), the infant Jean, born in 1919, is adopted by a rural couple who help maintain a wealthy family's estate. The novel follows his adventures and those of several others, notably the owner of the estate on which he is raised, until he joins the French army at the start of World War II. [[Diane Johnson]] compared Jean to Fielding's ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling|Tom Jones]]'', noting how "his picaresque adventures unfold in cheerful profusion, in and out of foreign countries and strange beds". She also recommended the novel for its depiction of the European political climate in the years between the world wars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Johnson |first1=Diane|title=European Pastoral |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/15/books/review/the-foundling-boy-by-michel-deon.html |accessdate=18 June 2014|work=New York Times|date=13 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sequel, ''[[The Foundling's War]]'' (''Les Vingt Ans du Jeune Homme Vert''), appeared in 1977.

In ''Un Souvenir'' (1990), Edward has just passed his sixtieth year and is beginning to consider himself an old man. He finds an old photo from 1936. It shows him hugging a beautiful girl named Sheila, an obscure yet unforgettable woman he met in England during the war. Despite his age, he returns to England to find her and come to terms with the regret and guilt at having lost her.

In ''Pages Grecques'' (1993), Déon explores the multi-layered mythical and actual history of Greek culture. Employing the gods, muses, and legendary Greek figures, alongside historical events and characters, Déon weaves Greece's dual histories together to create a beautiful and inspiring picture of the culture.

''[[The Great and the Good]]'' (''La Cour Des Grands'', 1996) follows the life of Arthur Morgan, the son of an impoverished French widow. He is offered a first class boat ticket to the United States in 1950 and there experiences all the classic elements of the American dream, graduating college and moving to New York City where he becomes a successful stockbroker. When he returns to France in the face of family tragedy, he is forced to reconcile his American life with a past life and is shocked to discover what has become of the friends of his youth.

''[[Horseman, Pass By!]]'' (''Cavalier, passe ton chemin!'', 2005) offers a social history of the Irish people that combines fact and fiction. Exploring the country's extraordinary folklore and cultural legends, Déon examines the nation's collective identity.

==English translations==
An English translation of ''Un déjeuner de soleil'' appeared in 1983 (UK) and 1989 (US) as ''[[Where Are You Dying Tonight?]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/dason-michel/where-are-you-dying-tonight/|publisher=Kirkus Reviews|title=Where are you dying tonight? |accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Le Jeune Homme vert'' appeared as ''The Foundling Boy'' in 2013, and the publisher, Gallic Books, published a translation of the sequel, ''Les Vingt Ans du Jeune Homme Vert'' as ''The Foundling's War'' in 2014.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/michel-deon/the-foundling-boy/|publisher=Kirkus Reviews|title=The Foundling Boy |accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "La Cours des grandes" as "The Great and the Good" in 2017.

'''Minjung theology''' ({{Korean|hangul=민중신학|rr=[[Minjung]] Sinhak|lit=the people's theology}}) emerged in the 1970s from the experience of South [[Christianity in Korea|Korean Christians]] in the struggle for [[social justice]]. It is a people's [[theology]], and, according to its authors, "a development of the political hermeneutics of the Gospel in terms of the Korean reality."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rcs8AAAAYAAJ|title=Minjung Theology: People as the Subjects of History|last=Suh|first=David Kwang-sun|publisher=Orbit Books|year=1983|isbn=9780862321918|editor-last=Commission on Theological Concerns of the Christian Conference of Asia|location=New York|pages=17|language=en|chapter=A Biographical Sketch of an Asian Theological Consultation|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Minjung]] theology began in South Korea in the 1970s with figures such as [[Ahn Byung-mu]], often considered the "father of minjung theology," [[Suh Nam-dong]], [[David Kwang-sun Suh]], and [[Kim Yong-bock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LCkmEKIy7OIC|title=A Protestant Theology of Passion: Korean Minjung Theology Revisited|last=Küster|first=Volker|date=|publisher=Brill|year=2010|isbn=9004175237|location=Leiden|pages=|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Minjung]]'', which means the "people" in the communist sense of the proletariat, is made up of people who are ostracized by the larger community.

It is part of a wider Asian theological ferment, but it was not designed for export. It "is firmly rooted in a particular situation, and growing out of the struggles of Christians who embrace their own history as well as the universal message of the Bible."{{cite quote|date=June 2017}}

As South Korea has grown to be more a prosperous nation, later generations of minjung theologians have needed to reevaluate who are the poor and oppressed [[minjung]] of Korea. As such, a number of minjung theologians have focused on questions of reunification with North Korea, identifying the minjung as all those oppressed in both Koreas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=F4FIBQAAQBAJ|title=A History of Korean Christianity|last=Kim|first=Sebastian C.

The modern '''Islamic gold dinar''' (sometimes referred as '''Islamic dinar''' or '''Gold dinar''') is a projected [[bullion]] [[gold coin]], so far not issued as official [[currency]] by any national state.  It aims to revive the historical [[gold dinar]] which was a leading coin of early Islam. They might consist of minted [[gold coin]]s, [[dinar]], and [[silver coin]]s, [[dirham]].

==Dinar history==
{{Main|Gold Dinar}}
[[File:Dinar of Abd al-Malik, AH 75.jpg|thumb|[[Gold dinar]] of [[Abd al-Malik]], AH 75, [[Umayyad Caliphate]].]]

According to Islamic law, the Islamic dinar is a coin of pure [[gold]] weighing 72 grains of average [[barley]]. Modern determinations of weight range from 4.44 grams to 4.5 grams of gold, with the silver Dir-ham being created to the weight ratio of 7:10, yielding coins from 3.11 to 3.15 grams of pure silver.

[[Umar|Umar Ibn al-Khattab]] established the known standard relationship between them based on their weights: 7 dinars must be equivalent (in weight) to 10 dirhams.

{{cquote|The Revelation undertook to mention them and attached many judgements to them, for example ''[[zakat]]'', marriage, and ''[[hudud]]'', etc., therefore within the Revelation they have to have a reality and specific measure for assessment of zakat, etc. upon which its judgements may be based rather than on the non-shari'i other coins.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Know that there is [[Ijma|consensus]] since the beginning of Islam and the age of the Companions and the Followers that the dirham of the shari'ah is that of which ten weigh seven [[Mithqal]]s weight of the dinar of gold... The weight of a [[Mithqal]] of gold is seventy-two grains of barley, so that the dirham which is seven-tenths of it is fifty and two-fifths grains. All these measurements are firmly established by consensus. |[[Ibn Khaldun]], [[Muqaddimah|Al-Muqaddimah]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ik/Muqaddimah/Chapter3/Ch_3_34.htm Ibn Khaldun, ''The Muqaddimah'', ch. 3 pt. 34]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Value and denomination==
[[File:Fatimid dinar - al-Moez li-dini Allah.jpg|thumb|Dinar issued during the reign of the [[Fatimid]] emir [[Al-Mu'izz li-Din Allah]] in [[Mansouria, Tunisia|Mansuriyah]] in 344 AH (955 AD)]]
[[File:Dinar of Baybars.jpg|thumb|Dinar of the Mamluq sultan [[Baybars]] (658–676 AH = 1260–1277 AD)]]
Per the historical law stated above, one dinar is 4.44&amp;nbsp;grams of pure gold, while one dirham is 3.11&amp;nbsp;grams of pure silver. A smaller denomination, daniq, weighs one sixth as much. The value of each coin is according to their weight and the market value of the two metals. The coins may be minted at fraction or multiples of their weights and valued accordingly.

==Adoption==

===Indonesia===
The currency was introduced in Indonesia in the year 2000 by the Islamic Mint Nusantara (IMN).

===Malaysia===

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[image:Kelantane Gold dinar.jpeg|thumb|[[Kelantan]], ([[Malaysia]]) Gold dinar minted by World Islamic Mint in 2010 [[CE]]]] --&gt;
In 2002, the prime minister of Malaysia proposed a gold dinar standard for use in the Islamic world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/node/3761805|title=Starkers|work=The Economist|accessdate=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kelantan was the first state in the country to introduce the dinar in 2006, which was locally minted. In 2010, it issued new coins, including the dirham, minted in the [[United Arab Emirates]] by the World Islamic Mint.&lt;ref&gt;The Malaysian Insider, ''Kelantan launches gold dinar'', August 12th 2010.{{cite web |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/kelantan-launches-gold-dinar/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100817063025/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/kelantan-launches-gold-dinar/ |archivedate=2010-08-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 August 2013 Kelantanese government collected and distributed [[zakat]] from people in Kelantanese dinars and dirhams in a public ceremony officiated by Chief Minister Dato [[Nik Aziz Nik Mat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamdag.info/news/1348|title=IslamDag.info|publisher=|accessdate=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state of Perak followed suit, minting its own dinar and dirham, which was launched in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;New Strait Times, ''Silver state launches dinar, dirham coins'', March 1st 2011.{{cite web |url=http://www.nst.com.my/nst/articles/20coin/Article/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110302020108/http://www.nst.com.my/nst/articles/20coin/Article |archivedate=2011-03-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[image:Perak Gold dinar.jpeg|thumb|[[Perak]], ([[Malaysia]]) [[Gold dinar]]]] --&gt;

===Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant===
The leader of the UN-designated terrorist group [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]], [[Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi]], announced in November 2014 that the Caliphate intended to mint its own gold, silver and copper coins in order to free the Muslims from the financial order that has "enslaved and impoverished" them.&lt;ref name="IsisDinar"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/14/isis-gold-silver-copper-islamic-dinar-coins "Isis to mint own Islamic dinar coins in gold, silver and copper"], ''The Guardian'', 14 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The currency would be based on the dinar coins minted by the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Caliphate]] of [[Uthman|Uthman ibn Affan]] and include seven coins: two gold, three silver and two copper, ranging in value from 7¢ to $694, their values based on the [[Intrinsic value (numismatics)|intrinsic value]] of the metals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/islamic-state/11230324/Islamic-State-announces-its-own-currency.html "Islamic State announces its own currency"], ''The Telegraph'', 14 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The gold dinar is weighted at 4.25 grams and is made of 21 karat gold.

Despite a propaganda push for the currency, adoption appeared to have been minimal and its internal economy is effectively [[dollarized]], even with regards to its own fines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dearden|first1=Lizzie|title=Isis fails to bring in own currency, relies on 'satanic' US dollars instead|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/isis-attempt-to-topple-us-economy-with-own-currency-failing-as-reliance-on-american-dollars-a6952566.html|accessdate=6 March 2018|work=The Independent|date=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other groups===
[[Abdalqadir as-Sufi]], founder of the [[Murabitun World Movement]], was once a strong proponent of the idea for the gold dinar revival movement, but in February 2014 he completely distanced himself from it, saying, "So, I now dis-associate myself from all activity involving the Islamic gold dinar and silver dirham".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shaykhabdalqadir.com/the-islamic-dinar-a-way-stage-passed/ "THE ISLAMIC DINAR – A WAY-STAGE PASSED" Shaykh Dr. Abdalqadir as-Sufi]&lt;/ref&gt;  Trinidadian scholar [[Imran N. Hosein|Imran Nazar Hosein]] has also been promoting the revival of Dinar usage, but has linked its use to [[Islamic eschatology]].

==Use==
Most of the coins are issued privately and are not [[legal tender]]. In Malaysia, the state government of Kelantan allows their use in transactions while it is illegal according to federal law.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Common uses of the gold dinar include:

# Buying merchandise from outlets.
# Holding accounts, and making and receiving payments as with any other medium of exchange.
# Saving, as is done with any form of gold.
# Paying [[zakat]] and [[mahr]] as established within [[Islamic Law]].

The '''Pigi Athinas''' (Greek Πηγή Αθηνάς, Source of Athena) is an archaeological site at the eastern foot of [[Mount Olympus]] (Lower Olympus), near the village of [[Platamonas]].&lt;ref&gt;Efi Poulaki-Pantermali: ''Oikos – Oikia – Oikonomia, Polis – Politiki – Politismos'', Greek Ministry for culture and sport, Thessaloniki 2014, page 72&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Grabbeigaben Pigi Athinas.jpg|thumb|Burial objects, Source of Athena]]
There is evidence of the presence of humans since the first half of the 7th millennium BC (Early [[Neolithic period]]). During the Middle Neolithic period, around 5600 to 4500 BC, the area was inhabited continuously. During the [[Bronze Age]], a necropolis with burial mounds (tumuli) was established. Another cemetery dates back to Roman times.

==The excavations==
The excavation work began in 2001 and was initially carried out until 2003. In April 2008, the excavations were resumed and ended in early 2011. The excavation site is located under the route of the highway Patras - Athens - Thessaloniki - Evzonoi (Πατρών - Aθηνών - Θεσσαλονίκης - Ευζώνων, short ΠΑΘΕ), the excavations were funded by the construction company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.culture.gr/anaskafes/pdfs/KZ_EPKA.pdf|title=Πηγή Αθηνάς}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The finds range from the Neolithic to the post-[[Byzantine period]] (after 1453 AD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.culture.gr/anaskafes/pdfs/KZ_EPKA.pdf|title=The Pigi Athinas of Macedonian Olympus, page 210}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/17546650/Tritsaroli_P._2017._The_Pigi_Athinas_tumuli_cemetery_of_Macedonian_Olympus_burial_customs_and_the_bioarchaeology_of_social_structures_at_the_dawn_of_the_Late_Bronze_Age_Central_Macedonia_Greece|title=Tritsaroli P. 2017. The Pigi Athinas tumuli cemetery of Macedonian Olympus, page 228.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Neolithic cemetery===
The burial mounds date from the period 1620-1500 BC; the tumuli were circular or elliptical and consisted of large pebbles, probably from the nearby river. All hills have a central tomb in the center, oriented in west-east direction. Except for one grave mound, under which only one single deceased was buried, around the central graves further graves were created. The middle grave is larger and deeper than the others. The pits were edged with stone and have a depth of up to 1.30 meters. Archaeologists found the skeletons of 17 people who died at the age of 20 to 50 years; as grave goods mainly pottery were found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/17546650/Tritsaroli_P._2017._The_Pigi_Athinas_tumuli_cemetery_of_Macedonian_Olympus_burial_customs_and_the_bioarchaeology_of_social_structures_at_the_dawn_of_the_Late_Bronze_Age_Central_Macedonia_Greece|title=Tritsaroli P. 2017. The Pigi Athinas tumuli cemetery of Macedonian Olympus, pages 229 to 232.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Roman cemetery===
16 people were buried here, skeletons of 12 adults and four children were discovered. The cemetery is located in the immediate vicinity of a Roman farmhouse and was created in the first half of the 4th century AD. The deceased were buried in simple pits. The graves were not looted and contained many grave goods.

Dating from the time of the [[Ottoman rule]], a water pipe was found near by the necropolis.

The settlement, belonging to the neolithic necropolis, has not yet been located.

The archaeological site is today largely under the route of the highway Patras, Athens, Thessaloniki, Evzonoi.

'''Professor John I.Q. Nerdelbaum Frink Jr.''',&lt;ref name=toh14/&gt; or simply '''Professor Frink''', is a recurring character in the [[Animated cartoon|animated television series]] ''[[The Simpsons]]''. He is voiced by [[Hank Azaria]], and first appeared in the 1991 episode "[[Old Money (The Simpsons episode)|Old Money]]". Frink is [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]]'s [[nerd]]y scientist and [[professor]] and is extremely intelligent, though somewhat mad and socially inept. Frink often tries to use his bizarre inventions to aid the town in its crises but they usually only make things worse. His manner of speech, including the impulsive shouting of nonsensical words, has become his [[trademark look|trademark]].

Frink was originally depicted as an evil scientist in "Old Money", since he was trying to secure funding for a death ray. When Azaria [[ad libitum|ad-libbed]] a voice for the character, he did an impression of [[Jerry Lewis]]'s Julius Kelp character from ''[[The Nutty Professor]]''. The staff liked the voice and therefore changed Frink to be more like Julius Kelp, both in appearance and personality{{snd}}he became more nerdy, and went from evil to just mad. Lewis later guest-starred on the show as Frink's father in the 2003 episode "[[Treehouse of Horror XIV]]".

The professor has received acclaim from critics, particularly for his bizarre inventions such as the hamburger [[earmuff]]s, and he has appeared on many reviewers' listings of their favorite supporting characters from ''The Simpsons''. Frink has been featured in other media relating to the show, such as comics, video games, and a [[simulator ride]] at [[Universal Studios Florida]]. The character's popularity has led to him giving the name to the computer programming language [[Frink (programming language)|Frink]].&lt;ref name="frinktool"/&gt;

==Character==
[[File:Hankazaria05.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Hank Azaria]] voices Frink]]
Frink first appeared in the [[The Simpsons (season 2)|season two]] episode "[[Old Money (The Simpsons)|Old Money]]" that aired on {{nowrap|March 28, 1991}}.&lt;ref name=tvguide/&gt;&lt;ref name=oldmoney/&gt; In that episode, [[Grampa Simpson]] inherits $106,000 from his girlfriend when she dies. He eventually decides to spend it on people who are in need of money and holds interviews. In one of these interviews, Frink introduces Grampa to his latest invention, the Death Ray, claiming that "it is just a prototype. With proper funding I'm confident this little baby could destroy an area the size of New York City!" Grampa responds with "But I want to help people, not kill 'em!", to which Frink replies "Oh. Well, to be honest, the ray only has evil applications. You know my wife will be happy, she's hated this whole Death Ray thing from day one."&lt;ref name=Money/&gt;

In the original script, Frink appeared more evil.&lt;ref name=oldmoney&gt;Groening, Matt; Jean, Al; Kogen, Jay; Silverman, David; Wolodarsky, Wallace (2002). [[Audio commentary]] for "[[Old Money (The Simpsons)|Old Money]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; However, when cast member [[Hank Azaria]] [[ad libitum|ad-libbed]] a voice for Frink, he did an impression of [[Jerry Lewis]]'s character Julius Kelp from the 1963 film ''[[The Nutty Professor]]'', and the writing staff started making Frink more of a parody of that character. Julius Kelp is a nerdy, mad professor, albeit not evil, and is often unsuccessful with his experiments, so Frink became more like that as the show progressed.&lt;ref name=oldmoney/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Comedian Lewis recovering from heart attack |url=http://www.zap2it.com/movies/news/zap-jerrylewismildheartattack,0,377757.story?coll=zap-movies-headlines |accessdate=2010-08-02 |newspaper=[[Zap2it]] |date=2006-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Simpsons'' creator [[Matt Groening]] told ''[[TV Guide]]'' that "He was just written as a mad scientist character until Hank did the voice, and suddenly he became this nutty professor persona. What I love about Hank is that, you give him a single line{{snd}}and most of these characters have very few lines{{snd}}and he just brings it to life. Every time."&lt;ref name=tvguide/&gt; Frink was originally animated without his buckteeth; they were added later on to make him look even more like Lewis's character.&lt;ref name=oldmoney/&gt; He was named after television writer [[John Frink]], who was later hired on ''The Simpsons''.&lt;ref name=oldmoney/&gt; Frink's nonsensical utterances are written in the scripts as "Frink noise".&lt;ref name="#30"&gt;{{cite news |last=Chant |first=Lisa |title=30 things you didn't know about The Simpsons |newspaper=[[The Sunday Mail (Brisbane)|Sunday Mail]] |date=2005-01-30 |page=066}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Azaria has voiced Frink ever since the first appearance of the professor.&lt;ref name="Hollingworth"/&gt; Of the many characters that Azaria voices, Frink is his favorite because he was a fan of Lewis in his younger years&lt;ref name="NorthernEcho"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Raise your glass |newspaper=[[Daily Express|The Express]] |date=2000-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he enjoys imitating the voice of the nutty professor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Knutzen |first=Eirik |title=Azaria finds therapeutic role as 'Huff' |newspaper=[[The State Journal-Register]] |date=2004-11-11 |page=9A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Actor Hank Azaria reveals a few of his favourite things |newspaper=[[The Mail on Sunday]] |date=2006-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has said that "once you start talking like [Julius Kelp] it's very hard to stop.

If they let me keep going, it gets ridiculous."&lt;ref name="NorthernEcho"&gt;{{cite news |title=Mummy's the word |newspaper=[[The Northern Echo]] |date=2009-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a homage to Lewis, Azaria conceived the idea of the "Treehouse of {{nowrap|Horror XIV}}" segment in which Frink revives his dead father, with Lewis guest starring as the father.&lt;ref name=tvguide&gt;{{cite news |title=Flash! 24 Simpsons stars reveal themselves |date=2000-10-21 |work=[[TV Guide]] |author=Rhodes, Joe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Battaglio |first=Stephen |title=Chills and Thrills from 'The Simpsons' |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/nydn-features/chills-thrills-simpsons-article-1.516833 |accessdate=2014-01-15 |newspaper=[[New York Daily News]] |date=2003-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a review of that episode, which aired around Halloween in 2003, Robert Bianco of ''[[USA Today]]'' wrote that it is hard to tell Frink and his father's voices apart: "Azaria voices Frink with such a spot-on Lewis imitation that it's sometimes hard to tell which one of the two nutty professors is talking."&lt;ref name="Bianco"&gt;{{cite news |last=Bianco |first=Robert |title='Simpsons,' 'Hill' get star treatment |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/reviews/2003-10-30-fox-cartoons_x.htm |accessdate=2010-08-01 |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |date=2001-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, ''[[The Knoxville News-Sentinel]]''{{'}}s Terry Morrow commented that "to hear Lewis doing Azaria doing Lewis is a mind-bending gut buster, the kind of pay-off that die-hard ''Simpsons'' fans live for."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Morrow |first=Terry |title='Simpsons' marks 15 years of quirky humor |newspaper=[[The Knoxville News-Sentinel]] |date=2003-10-31 |page=E5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Frink is a popular character on ''The Simpsons'' and he has received acclaim from critics. Mark Hughes Cobb of ''[[The Tuscaloosa News]]'' named him his favorite secondary character from the show.&lt;ref name="Tuscaloosa"/&gt; ''[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]]''{{'}}s Robert Philpot called the professor one of the five best supporting characters on ''The Simpsons'', writing that "Springfield's mad scientist is a triumph of style over substance, with Hank Azaria giving him a ripoff Jerry Lewis voice that reminds you why we once thought Lewis was funny."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Philpot |first=Robert |title=D'oh-boy! – 'The Simpsons ' marks its 300th episode of razor-sharp satire |newspaper=[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]] |date=2003-02-15 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; On their list of the top twenty-five peripheral ''Simpsons'' characters, [[IGN]]'s Eric Goldman, Dan Iverson, and Brian Zoromski listed Frink at number fourteen, commenting that he fits nicely into the ''Simpsons'' universe "as the town's brilliant mad scientist." They highlighted a scene from the episode "[[The PTA Disbands]]", in which Frink becomes a kindergarten substitute teacher and keeps one of the children's toys to himself because the children "wouldn't enjoy it on as many levels" as he did.&lt;ref name="IGN"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/730/730957p2.html |title=The top 25 Simpsons peripheral characters|accessdate=2010-08-01 |date=2006-10-06 |publisher=[[IGN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nick Griffiths of ''[[Radio Times]]'' named Frink one of the best characters of the show, stating that he has "always loved Professor Frink", particularly because of his appearance, gibberish talking, and overuse of the word "the", and because of his inventions such as the matter teleporter that turns Bart into half-human half-fly.&lt;ref name="RadioTimes"&gt;{{cite news|last=Griffiths |first=Nick |title=The best...

Several critics have commented on Frink's inventions. Patrick Goss of [[MSN]]'s ''Tech &amp; Gadgets'' wrote that "When it comes to gizmos, Frink is the king", and listed the Death Ray as one of the greatest gadgets featured in ''The Simpsons''. Although he added that it "was not one of [Frink's] most successful", since it never received the funding it needed from Grampa.&lt;ref name="MSN"&gt;{{cite web |last=Goss |first=Patrick |title=Great gadgets of The Simpsons |url=http://tech.uk.msn.com/features/articles.aspx?cp-documentid=149575278 |work=Tech &amp; Gadgets |publisher=[[MSN]] |accessdate=2010-08-02 |date=2009-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same list, Goss also featured Frink's automatic phone dialer, intra bovine ice-cream maker (an invention that is inserted into a cow and uses the [[cattle#Anatomy|four stomachs]] to mix the various ingredients), and hamburger earmuffs.&lt;ref name="MSN"/&gt; In a profile about Frink, the publication [[UGO Networks]] wrote: "Where would the town be without your Jerry Lewis/Julius Kelp-inspired voice and antics?

{{Vaishnavism}}
The '''Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple'''  or '''Thiruvarangam''' is a [[Hindu temple]] dedicated to [[Ranganatha]], a reclining form of the [[Hindu deity]] [[Vishnu]], located in [[Srirangam]], [[Tiruchirapalli]], Tamil Nadu, India.&lt;ref name=unescosrirang/&gt; Constructed in the [[Dravidian Architecture]], this temple is glorified by [[Alvars]] in their [[Naalayira Divya Prabhandham|Divya Prabhanda]]{{sfn|David N. Lorenzen|2005|pp=52-54, 87-93}} and is number one or First among the 108 [[Divya Desams]] dedicated to Vishnu.&lt;ref name=unescosrirang/&gt;

It is one of the most illustrious ''[[Vaishnava]]'' temples in [[South India]] rich in legend and history. The temple has played an important role in [[Vaishnavism]] history starting with the 11th-century career of [[Ramanuja]] and his predecessors [[Nathamuni]] and Yamunacharya in Srirangam.{{sfn|Spencer| 1978| pp=16-19}} Its location, on an island between the Kollidam and [[Kaveri]] rivers,&lt;ref name=unescosrirang/&gt; has rendered it vulnerable to flooding as well as the rampaging of invading armies which repeatedly commandeered the site for military encampment.{{sfn|Spencer| 1978| pp=14-19}} The temple was looted and destroyed by the [[Delhi Sultanate]] armies in a broad plunder raid on various cities of the [[Pandyan dynasty|Pandyan kingdom]] in early 14th century. The temple was rebuilt in late 14th century,{{sfn|Hopkins| 2002| pp= 68-69}}{{sfn|Spencer| 1978| pp=19-21, Quote: "It was Malik Kafur's spectacular southern raid of 1310-11 AD which resulted in the initial plundering of the Srirangam, Chidambaram, and other famous temples of the Tamil country."}} the site fortified and expanded with many more gopurams in the 16th and 17th centuries.{{sfn|Abdur Rahman|1999|pp=377-378}}{{sfn|George Michell|Clare Arni|1999|pp=76-77}} It was one of the hubs of early [[Bhakti movement]] with a devotional singing and dance tradition, but this tradition stopped during the 14th century and was revived in a limited way much later.&lt;ref name=parthasarathy137&gt;T.S. Parthasarathy (1978), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/24158234 Music and Dance in Tamil Literature], Indian Literature, Vol. 21, No. 4, pages 137-148; Quote: "The hymns of the Divyaprabandham bad also been set to music and were being sung till the 14th century when the sack of Srirangam by Malik Kafur put an end to the practice."&lt;/ref&gt; 

The temple occupies an area of {{convert|155|acre}} with 50 shrines, 21 towers, 39 pavilions and many water tanks integrated into the complex making it the world's largest functioning Hindu temple.{{sfn|Mittal|Thursby|2005|p= 456}}&lt;ref name=unescosrirang/&gt; The temple town is a significant archaeological and epigraphical site, providing a historic window into the early and mid medieval South Indian society and culture. Numerous inscriptions suggest that this Hindu temple served not only as a spiritual center, but also a major economic and charitable institution that operated education and hospital facilities, ran a free kitchen, and financed regional infrastructure projects from the gifts and donations it received.&lt;ref name=unescosrirang/&gt;&lt;ref name=srirangamhos&gt;'''[a]''' VN Hari Ram (1961), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/44140717 Services in Srirangam Temple], Proceedings of the Indian History Congress, Volume 24, pages 89-92;&lt;br&gt;'''[b]''' {{cite book | last=Trouillet | first=Pierre-Yves | title=Exploring Urban Change in South Asia | chapter=Hindu Temples and Development of Localities in Tamil Nadu (South India) | publisher=Springer | year=2017 | isbn=978-81-322-3614-6 | doi=10.1007/978-81-322-3616-0_12 | pages=311–334}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|According to Burton Stein, "(...) the stone and copper inscriptions, the basic historical sources of this period, give more information about temples (...) temples mobilized resources of land and money second only to the state and were therefore capable of financing such projects."

The Srirangam temple is the largest temple compound in India and one of the largest religious complexes in the world.{{sfn|Mittal|Thursby|2005|p= 456}}&lt;ref name=unescosrirang/&gt; Some of these structures have been renovated, expanded and rebuilt over the centuries as a living temple. The latest addition is the outer tower that is {{convert|67|m}} tall, completed in 1987.{{sfn|Mittal|Thursby| 2005| p= 457}} Srirangam temple is often listed as one of the largest functioning [[Hindu temple]] in the world, the still larger [[Angkor Wat]] being the largest existing temple.{{sfn|Vater| 2010| p=40}}{{sfn|Jones| 2004| p= 4}} The temple is an active Hindu house of worship and follows [[Thenkalai]] tradition of [[Sri Vaishnavism]]. The annual 21-day festival conducted during the Tamil month of ''Margazhi'' (December–January) attracts 1 million visitors. The temple complex has been nominated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and is in UNESCO's tentative list.&lt;ref name=unescosrirang&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5894/ Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple, Srirangam], UNESCO&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location ==
The Ranganathaswamy Temple at Srirangam, also known as Thiruvaranga Tirupati, is located about {{convert|12|km}} north of the city of [[Tiruchirappalli]], about {{convert|325|km||-1}} southwest of [[Chennai]].

[[File:Aerial View of Srirangam Temple and Kaveri River.jpg|upright=1.2|thumb|left|Srirangam temple complex across the river on left.]]
The temple site is on a large island bounded by the Kaveri River and Kollidam River.&lt;ref name=unescosrirang/&gt; It is vast and planned as a temple town with ''Sapta-Prakaram'' design where the sanctum, gopuram, services and living area are co-located in seven concentric enclosures. Rampart walls were added after medieval centuries that saw its invasion and destruction. The temple monuments are located inside the inner five enclosures of the complex, surrounded by living area and infrastructure in outer two enclosures.

== History ==
A temple at Srirangam is mentioned in Tamil literature of the [[Sangam era]] (1st to the 4th century AD&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/art/shangam-literature Sangam literature], Encyclopaedia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;), including the epic ''[[Silappatikaram|Silapadikaram]]'' (book 11, lines 35–40):{{sfn|Silappadikaram}}

Beyond the ancient textual history, archaeological evidence such as inscriptions refer to this temple, but these stone inscriptions are from late 1st millennium AD.{{sfn|Sircar| 1979| p= 64}} The inscriptions in the temple belong to the [[Chola]], [[Pandya]], [[Hoysala]] and [[Vijayanagar Empire|Vijayanagar]] dynasties who ruled over the region. These inscriptions range in date between the 9th and 16th centuries.{{sfn|Ayyar| 1991|p= 462}}

During the period of invasion and plunder by the Ala ud Din Khilji's Muslim general [[Malik Kafur]] and his [[Delhi Sultanate]] forces in 1311, the Arabic texts of the period state that he raided a "golden temple" on river "Kanobari" (Kaveri), destroyed the temple and took the plunder with the golden idol of the deity to [[Delhi]]. According to Steven P. Hopkins, this is believed to be the Ranganathaswamy Temple.{{sfn|Hopkins| 2002| pp= 68-69}}

The Tamil texts that followed offer various inconsistent legends on how the temple regained the Vishnu idol. According to one found in ''Koil Oluku'', a young girl had vowed to fast till she had seen the idol.{{sfn|Hopkins| 2002| pp= 68-69}}  She followed the Muslim army as it returned with the loot back to Delhi. There she sneaked into the palace and saw that the Sultan's daughter had fallen in love with the image. The young girl returned to Srirangam and told the priests about what she had seen in Delhi. The priests went with musicians to Delhi, found the idol in capriciously playful possession of the Sultan's daughter, day and night.{{sfn|Hopkins| 2002| pp= 68-69}}  They sang and danced before the Sultan to return the idol, and he gave it back which upset his daughter. To console the daughter, the Sultan sent in his army again to bring it back, but this time they were not successful.{{sfn|Hopkins| 2002| pp= 68-69}} According to other versions, the Muslim daughter followed the idol from Delhi to Srirangam on a horse, symbolizing that love brought back the icon after war had taken it away.{{sfn|Sundararajan|Mukerji| 2003| pp= 434-435}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Davis | first=Richard H. | title=A Muslim princess in the temples of Viṣṇu | journal=International Journal of Hindu Studies | publisher=Springer Nature | volume=8 | issue=1-3 | year=2004  | doi=10.1007/s11407-004-0006-y | pages=137–156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond these legends, there was a more severe second invasion of South India including Srirangam in 1323 AD.{{sfn|Hopkins| 2002| pp= 59-60}} The sanctum's Vishnu image with its jewelry was pre-emptively removed by the Hindus before the Delhi Sultanate troops reached Srirangam by a group led by the Vaishnavite [[Acharya|Acharaya]] Pillai Lokacharyar to [[Tirunelveli]] in Tamil Nadu. The Goddess [[Ranganayaki]] (Lakshmi) was also taken away to another location by a separate group. The temple was defended and according to the Tamil tradition some 13,000 [[Sri Vaishnavism|Sri Vaishnavas]] devotees of Srirangam, died in the fierce battle.{{sfn|Ramaswamy| 2007| pp= 301–302}}

After nearly six decades when [[Madurai Sultanate]] ruled after the Chola rulers were ousted after the repeated Delhi Sultanate's invasions, the Vijayanagara Empire ousted the Madurai Sultanate in 1378.&lt;ref&gt;George Michell (2008), Architecture and art of Southern India, Cambridge University Press, pages 9-13, 16-21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Howard2012p93"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael C.

They finally went to the hills of [[Tirumala Tirupati]], where they remained until the temple was rebuilt in 1371.{{sfn|Hopkins| 2002| p= 69}} The idol was consecrated again according to the legends. This time, in memory of the first Sultan's daughter which tradition calls ''Thulukha Nachiyar'', a niche in the temple was built for her. The niche shows her as a girl sitting on a horse that carried her to Delhi. Her legend is still remembered. During contemporary processions when the idol is taken out of sanctum and then returned to it after its journey, ''Thulukha Nachiyar'' is dressed in Muslim garments and food offerings are made to her in the form of butter and ''[[chappati|chappathis]]'' (wheat bread).{{sfn|Sundararajan|Mukerji| 2003| p= 434}}

Thereafter, under Vijayanagara Empire, the temple site saw over 200 years of stability, repairs, first round of fortifications, and addition of mandapas.{{sfn|Michell|1995|pp=73-74}} The Vishnu and Lakshmi images were reinstalled and the site became an Hindu temple again in 1371 CE under Kumara Kampana, a Vijayanagara commander and the son of [[Bukka I]].{{sfn|Michell|1995|pp=76-77}} In the last decade of the 14th century, a pillared antechamber was gifted by the Vijayanagara rulers. In the 15th century, they coated the apsidal roofs with solid gold sheets, followed by financing the addition of a series of new shrines, mandapas and gopuras to the temple, according to George Michell.{{sfn|Michell|1995|pp=76-77}}

After the destruction of the Vijayanagara in late 16th century, geo-political instability returned.

===Sri Vaishnavism===
The epigraphical evidence suggests that these Hindu dynasties — Cholas, Pandiyas, Hoysalas, [[Nayak dynasty|Nayaks]], Vijayanagar – assisted with rebuilding, renovation and supported the traditional customs. Some mention substantial gifts to the temple. A Chola king, for example, presented the temple with a golden serpent couch. Some historians identify this king with Rajamahendra Chola. The temple has witnessed and played a key role in the early [[Sri Vaishnavism]] history, particularly the centuries that followed the major Hindu philosopher [[Ramanuja]] (1017–1137 AD), and his predecessors Nathamuni and Yamunacharya.{{sfn|Spencer| 1978| pp=16-19}}.{{sfn|Hopkins| 2002| pp= 34-37}} It witnessed the debate between the Dvaita (dualistic) and Advaita (nondualistic) sub-traditions within Vaishnavism. Centuries later, it was a key site in the debate and disagreements between the northern Tamil and southern Tamil traditions, also called as the [[Vadakalai]] and [[Thenkalai]].{{sfn|Hopkins| 2002| pp= 31-37, 58-59}} The early rulers such as the Pallavas, Cholas and Pandiyas supported it as a hub of the [[Bhakti movement]] with a devotional singing and dance tradition, but this tradition stopped during the 14th century and was revived in a limited way much later.&lt;ref name=parthasarathy137/&gt;

=== Puranical Story ===
[[File:Ranganatha.jpg|thumb|[[Ranganatha]] painting (not from the temple, nothing like the one in the temple).]]
The temple and its artwork are a subject of numerous different Tamil legends covered in regional [[Puranas|Puranic]] texts. ''Sriranga Mahathmiyam'', for example, is one of the compilation of the temple mythology about its origins.{{sfn|Anna L. Dallapiccola|2002}} According to it, Brahma was performing austerities during the ''samudra manthan'' (churning of cosmic ocean), and Srirangam Vimanam emerged as a result. It remained in Satyaloka for ages, was brought to [[Ayodhya]] by king Ikshvaku.{{sfn|Roshen Dalal|2010|pp=339-340}} After [[Rama]], an [[Avatar]] of Vishnu had killed the evil demon Ravana, he gave it to King [[Vibhishana]] who wanted to be with Rama.{{sfn|Khanna| 2003| p= 197}} When Vibhishana passed through [[Trichy]] en route to Sri Lanka where he had become the king, the Srirangam Vimanam would not move from the island. So he gave it to a local king called Dharma Varma if the king consecrated the Vimanam to face the south cardinal direction eternally, blessing him and Lanka. Hence it is that the deity (in a reclining posture) faces South, his body aligned to the east-west axis.{{sfn|Gray|Hancock| 2003| p= 134}}{{sfn|Bhoothalingam|2011|pp=53-58}}

As per another legend, [[Sanaka]], the four child sages, came for a ''[[darshana]]'' of Ranganatha in Srirangam. They were stopped by [[Jaya-Vijaya|Jaya and Vijaya]], the guardians of [[Vaikuntha]]. In spite of their pleadings, they were refused entry. In anger, all four of them cursed the guardians in one voice and left. The guardians approached Vishnu and told him about the curse. Ranganatha said that he would not be able to revert the curse and gave them two options: be born as demons opposing Vishnu in three births or good human beings in the following seven births. The guardians accepted being demons and are believed to have taken the form of [[Hiranyaksha]] &amp; [[Hiranyakasipu]], [[Ravana]] &amp; [[Kumbakarna]] and [[Sisupala]] &amp; [[Dantavakra]]. Vishnu took three [[avatar]]s – Narasimha, Rama and Krishna respectively – to kill the demons in each one of those births.{{sfn|Bhoothalingam|2011|pp=53-58}}

== Architecture ==
[[File:Plan of Srirangam Temple. Burgess,1910.jpg|thumb|Plan of four inner courts of the Srirangam Temple (Burgess, 1910)]]
The temple is enclosed by 7 concentric enclosures with courtyards (termed ''[[prakarams]]'' or ''mathil suvar''). Each layer has walls and gopurams, which were built or fortified in and after the 16th century. These walls total {{Convert|32,592|ft}} or over six miles. The temple has 17 major ''gopurams'' (towers, 21 total),{{refn|group=note|The gopurams, when present, are found in the middle of each side of all seven courtyards allowing the pilgrims and visitors to enter from any of the four direction. In some cases the geographical constraints did not permit addition of a gateway and it is here that the courtyard  may have less than four entrances. The gateways are taller on the outer courtyards, with the largest found on the south side of the outermost courtyard.{{sfn|Michell|1995|pp=108-109}}}} 39 pavilions, 50 shrines, 9 sacred water pools, ''Ayiram kaal [[mandapa]]m'' (a hall of 1000 pillars) and several small water bodies inside.&lt;ref name=unescosrirang/&gt;{{sfn|Mittal|Thursby|2005|pp= 456-457}}

The temple is aligned to the north-south and east-west axis, on an island surrounded by the Kaveri River. The river has long been considered sacred, and called the ''Daksina Ganga'' or the "Ganges of the South".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/place/Kaveri-River Kaveri River], Encyclopaedia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt; The outer two ''prakarams'' (outer courtyard) are residential and markets with shops, restaurants and flower stalls.{{sfn|Mittal|Thursby|2005|pp= 456-457}}{{sfn|Malcolm|1839| p=69}} The five inner courtyards have shrines to Vishnu and his various [[avatar]]s such as Rama and Krishna. Major shrines are additionally dedicated to goddess Lakshmi and many saints of Vaishnavism. In particular, these shrines celebrate and commemorate the Bhakti movement poet-saints called the [[Alvars]], as well Hindu philosophers such as Ramanuja and Vedantadesika of [[Sri Vaishnavism]] tradition.{{sfn|Mittal|Thursby|2005|pp= 456-457}}

Despite the construction of various mandapas and gopuras over a span of many centuries, the architecture of the Ranganathaswamy temple is one of the better illustrations of Hindu temple planometric geometry per ''agama'' design texts in the Tamil tradition. According to George Michell, a professor and art historian on Indian architecture, the regulating geometry and plan of Srirangam site takes on "a ritual dimension since all the architectural components, especially the focal gopuras and the most important colonnades and mandapas, are arranged along the axes dictated by the cardinal directions". This alignment integrates the routes that devotees follow as they journey unto the innermost sanctum.{{sfn|Michell|1995|pp=73-75}}

=== Shrines ===

The temple complex includes over 50 shrines. These are dedicated to Vishnu, Lakshmi as well as various Vaishnava scholars and poets. The shrines to Vishnu display him in his various [[avatar]]s, as well as his iconography. For example, the Ranganathaswamy temple shrines and symbolism include those to [[Sudarshana Chakra|Chakkarathazhwar]], [[Narasimha]], [[Rama]], [[Hayagreeva]] and [[Gopala Krishna]].

The Chakrathazhwar shrine is in east facing on the south side of Akalanka. The sanctum is approached through a Mukamandapa (six rows of pillars) built during the [[Cholas]] and a Mahamandapa with six rows of eight pillars built during the period of [[Vijayanagar Empire]]. There is a circumambulation passage around the sanctum. The image of Chakrathazhwar is sculpted with [[Narasimha]] on the rear side and can be viewed from the passage around the sanctum.{{sfn|Madhavan|2007|pages=85–86}} The Venugopala shrine, one of the most elaborately carved, is in the south-west corner of the fourth enclosure of the temple was built by [[Chokkanatha Nayak]], according to an inscription dated 1674.{{sfn|Michell|1995|pp=108-109}}

The main shrine for Ranganatha is in the innermost courtyard. The sanctum has a golden ''[[Vimana (architectural feature)|vimanam]]'' (crown tower over the sanctum sanctorum). It is shaped like the Tamil ''[[om]]kara'' (om symbol), shows anthropomorphic Paravasudeva on its gable, has an etching of Ramanuja as well on it, and is plated with gold.

The sanctum can be entered through the south gateway, one the reclining Vishnu is facing. The doorway as one enters from the ''mukhamandapam'', also called the ''Gayatri mantapa'', is flanked by Jaya and Vijaya dvarapalas. The sanctum chamber is round, even though the vimana above is an oval projection.

The exterior of the ''vimana'' and attached ''[[mandap]]'' (hall) have intricately carved pilasters with fluted shafts, double capitals, and pendant lotus brackets. Sculptures are placed in the niches of three sides of the sanctuary walls; maidens enhance the walls in between. The elevation is punctuated with a secondary set of pilasters that support shallow eaves at different levels to cap larger and smaller recesses. The sanctuary is crowned in the traditional fashion with a hemispherical roof. The double-curved eaves of the entrance porch on the east side are concealed in a later columned hall.{{sfn|Michell| 1995| p= 109}}  [[Dhanvantari]], a great physician of ancient India is considered to be an [[avatar]] of Vishnu&amp;nbsp;– there is a separate shrine of Dhanvantari within the temple.{{sfn|Sircar| 1971| p= 162}}

Ranganayaki (Lakshmi) shrine is in the second precinct of the temple. During the festival processions, Ranganayaki does not visit Ranganatha, but it is he who visits her. Ranganathar visiting Ranganayaki and being with her is called as 'Saerthi' during 'Panguni Uthiram'.  There are three images of Ranganayaki within the sanctum.

There are separate shrines for major saints in the [[Vaishnava]] tradition, including [[Ramanuja]].

=== Mandapams (Halls) ===
[[File:Le temple de Srirangam (Tiruchirapalli, Inde) (13887774522).jpg|thumb|right|Sesharayar mandapam artwork]]
The Ranganathaswamy Temple has many mandapams:&lt;ref name=unescosrirang/&gt;{{sfn|Michell|1995|pp=108-110}}
*Thousand pillar mandapam is a theatre like structure made from granite. It was built during the [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagara rule]] period. It has a central wide aisle with seven side aisles on each side with pillars set in a square pattern.
*Sesharaya mandapam is the intricately carved hall built during the Nayaka rule period. It is found on the east side of the fourth ''prakaram'' courtyard. The northern side of this community hall has 40 leaping animals with riders on their back, all carved out of monolithic pillars. 
*Garuda Mandapam is named after the ''vahana'' (vehicle) of Vishnu, named Garuda. It is on the south side of the third ''prakaram'' courtyard. It too is dated to the Nayak rule era. Inside the community hall, on its pillars, are portrait sculptures. In the middle is a free-standing seated Garuda figure, identifiable by his eagle-head, wings and him facing the Vishnu shrine.
*Kili mandapam is found inside the innermost (first) ''prakaram'' courtyard. It is next to the Ranganatha sanctum. Here walking elephant balustrades line the steps that lead into the gathering hall. This is dated to the 17th century Hindu rulers. The hall and structural elements are carved with animals, and in its center is a raised square platform with four carved pillars.
*Ranga Vilasa mandapam is one of the larger community halls designed for large spaces between the pillars for the pilgrim groups and families to sit together and rest. It is covered with Hindu mythology murals and narratives from the Ramayana.

The Hall of 1000 pillars (actually 953) is a fine example of a planned theatre-like structure and opposite to it is the "Sesha Mandap". The 1000-pillared hall made of granite{{sfn|Malcolm|1839| p= 70}} was constructed in the [[Vijayanagara]] period (1336–1565) on the site of the old temple.{{sfn|Doniger|1999|p=1026}} The most artistic halls that the Nayaks added to the complex is the ''Sesha Mandap'' on the east side of the fourth enclosure.{{sfn|Dallapiccola|2007|p=78}} The hall is celebrated for the leaping animals carved on to the piers at its northern end.{{sfn|Michell| 1995| p= 109}} The pillars consists of sculptures of wildly rearing horses bearing riders on their backs and trampling with their hoofs upon the heads of rampant tigers, seem only natural and congruous among such weird surroundings.{{sfn|Klein| 1895| p= 89}} The great hall is traversed by one wide aisle in the centre for the whole of its greater length, and intersected by transepts of like dimension running across at right angles. There still remain seven side aisles on each side, in which all the pillars are equally spaced out.{{sfn|Fergusson| 1876| p= 352}}
The ''Garuda Madapa'' (hall of the legendary bird deity of Vishnu, ''[[garuda]]'') located on the south side of the third enclosure is another Nayak addition. Courtly portrait sculptures, reused from an earlier structure, are fixed to the piers lining the central aisle. A free-standing shrine inside the hall contains a large seated figure of ''garuda''; the eagle-headed god faces north towards the principal sanctum.{{sfn|Michell| 1995| p= 109}}
The ''Kili mandapa'' (Hall of parrot) is located next to the Ranganatha shrine, in the first enclosure of the temple. Elephant balustrades skirt the access steps that ascend to a spacious open area. This is bounded by decorated piers with rearing animals and attached colonettes in the finest 17th-century manner. Four columns in the middle define a raised dais; their shafts are embellished with undulating stalks.{{sfn|Michell| 1995| p= 109}}

=== Gopurams ===
[[File:Srirangam Temple Gopuram.jpg|200x200px|thumb|Vellai ''[[gopuram]]s'' (tower)]]
There are 21 ''[[gopurams]]'' (tower gateways), among which the towering ''Rajagopuram'' (shrine of the main gateway) is the tallest temple tower in Asia. The 13-tiered  ''Rajagopuram''  was built in 1987 by [[Ahobila Mutt|Ahobhila Matha]], a historic Srivaishnava Hindu monastery. This tower dominates the landscape for miles around, while the remaining 20 gopurams were built between the 12th and early 17th centuries. The ''gopurams'' have pronounced projections in the middle of the long sides, generally with openings on each of the successive levels. The ''Vellai gopura'' (white tower) on the east side of the fourth enclosure has a steep pyramidal superstructure that reaches a height of almost {{convert|44|m}}.{{sfn|Michell| 1995| p= 109}} The structure of the Rajagopuram remained incomplete for over 400 years. Started during the reign of [[Achyuta Deva Raya]] of [[Vijayanagara Empire]], the construction stopped after the fall of Vijayanagara in late 16th century and wars thereafter. The Rajagopuram (the main ''gopuram'') did not reach its current height of {{convert|73|m}} until 1987, when the 44th Jiyar (acharya, chief counsellor) of Ahobila Matha began collecting donations to complete it. The whole structure was constructed in a span of eight years. The Rajagopuram  was consecrated on 25 March 1987.&lt;ref name="Vasantha2001p52"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rangachar Vasantha|title=Ahobilam: Sri Narasimha Swamy Temple|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=z3LXAAAAMAAJ|year=2001|publisher=Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams|pages=52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; The length and breadth at the base of the Rajagopuram is {{Convert|166 and 97|ft||1}}, while the length and breadth at the top is {{Convert|98 and 32|ft|}}.

=== Inscriptions and frescoes ===
The Ranganathaswamy Temple town has over 800 inscriptions, of which nearly 640 are on temple walls and monuments. Many of these relate to gifts and grants by rulers or the elite, while others relate to the temple's management, scholars, dedication and general operation. The inscriptions have been a source of information about South Indian history, culture, economy and social role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=N Rajendran|title=Epigraphical evidences in the reconstruction of the early history of Tiruchirapalli|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NYNjAAAAMAAJ|year=1993|publisher=Journal of the Epigraphical Society of India|pages=152–155}}&lt;/ref&gt; These range from the late 9th century to the rule of [[Aditya I|Aditya Chola I]], to the last historical ones from the 16th century.

The historic inscriptions at the Ranganathaswamy Temple are in six major Indian languages: Tamil, Sanskrit,Kannada, Telugu, Marathi and Odiya. Further they are in several scripts including Tamil and Grantha. This diversity and the spread of inscription dates suggests that the temple has been an important pilgrimage center to both Tamil and non-Tamil Hindus.&lt;ref&gt;P.R. Srinivasan (1982), South Indian Inscriptions Volume XXIV, Archaeological Survey of India, pages xiv-xv&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the mandapam and corridors of the Temple complex have frescoes, of which some have faded. These narrate Hindu legends and mythologies, or scenes relating to Vaishnava scholars.&lt;ref name=unescosrirang/&gt;

=== Granaries, tanks and other monuments ===
The Ranganathaswamy Temple complex includes huge medieval era ''Kottarams'' or granaries. These provided food reserves and security to the temple town and supplies to its kitchen serving the needy travelers, pilgrims and local population.&lt;ref name=ghosh377&gt;Bijit Ghosh and K.C.

The temple has wooden monuments that is regularly maintained and used for festive processions. These have intricate carvings of Hindu legends, and some are plated with silver or gold foils. The most significant of the temple chariots are the Garuda vahana, the Simha vahana, the Yanai vahana, the Kudirai vahana, the Hanumantha vahana, the Yazhi vahana, the Sesha vahana, the Annapakshi vahana, the Otrai vahana and the Prabhai vahana.&lt;ref name=unescosrirang/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raju Kalidos (1988), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25212248 The Wood Carvings of Tamil Nadu: An Iconographical Survey], The Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, Cambridge University Press, No. 1 (Vol. 1988), pages 98-125&lt;/ref&gt;

Ranganathaswamy temple is the only one out of the 108 temples that was sung in praise by all the  [[Azhwars]](Divine saints of Tamil Bhakthi movement), having a total of 247 ''pasurams'' (divine hymns) against its name. ''Acharyas'' ([[guru]]) of all schools of thought&amp;nbsp;– [[Advaita]], [[Vishistadvaita]] and [[Dvaita]] recognise the immense significance of the temple, regardless of their affiliations.

[[Nalayira Divya Prabhandam]] is a collection of 4000 hymns sung by twelve ''azhwars'' saints spread over 300 years (from the late 6th to 9th century AD) and collected by [[Nathamuni]] (910–990 AD).{{sfn|Mukherjee|1998|p=248}} ''[[Divya Desams]]'' refer to 108 Vishnu temples that are mentioned in Nalayira Divya Prabandham. 105 of these are located in [[India]], 1 in [[Nepal]], while 2 are located outside of the Earthly realms. ''Divya'' in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] language indicates premium and ''Desam'' indicates place or temple.

[[Kambar (poet)|Kambar]] is a 12th-century Tamil poet who composed [[Kamba Ramayanam]], a work inspired from the epic, [[Valmiki Ramayana]]. He is believed to have come to the temple to get the approval of his work from scholars. The [[Jain]] scholar Tirunarungundam honoured the work and it resulted in Tamil and [[Sanskrit]] scholars approving the work.{{sfn|Kanuga| 1993| p= 15}}  The open hall where he recited his verse lies close to the Ranganayaki shrine within the temple.

Some of the religious works like ''Sri Bhashyam'' by [[Ramanuja]], ''Gadya Traya'' (which is a compilation of three texts called the ''[[Saranagati Gadyam]]'', ''[[Sriranga Gadyam]]'' and the ''[[Vaikunta Gadyam]]'') by Ramanuja,{{sfnref|K.S.|2002|p=55}} ''Sri Renga natha shtakam'' by [[Shankaracharya|Adi Shankaracharya]],{{sfn|Proceedings of the Madras Music conferences|p=22}} ''Paduka Sahasram'' by Swami [[Vedanta Desika]],{{sfn|Lal| 2001| p= 4525}} ''Renga raja Stavam'' and ''Guna ratna kosham'' by Sri Parasar bhattar,{{sfn|Kumar| 1997| p= 77}} ''Renga raja Sthothram'' by Kurathazhwar, ''Bhagavad dhyana Sopnam'' and ''Abheethi Stavam'' by Swami Vedanta Desika{{sfn|V.K.| 2007| p= 77}} are works that were exclusively composed in praise of Srirangam temple.

=== Pilgrimage ===
The term ''Kovil'' is generally used in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] to signify any temple, for many [[Vaishnavas]] the term ''Kovil'' exclusively refers to this temple, indicating its extreme importance for them (for [[saivas]] and all other Tamil people the term ''kovil'' refers to Thillai Natarajar Golden Shrine ([[Chidambaram Temple]])). The presiding deity Ranganathar is praised in many names by his devotees, including ''Nam Perumal'' (our god in Tamil), ''Azhagiya Manavaalan'' (beautiful groom in Tamil).

The temple is considered in the Alwar traditions as one of the eight ''Sywayambu Kshetras'' of Vishnu where presiding deity is believed to have manifested on its own. Seven other temples in the line are [[Bhu Varaha Swamy temple]], [[Tirumala Venkateswara Temple]], and [[Vanamamalai Perumal Temple]] in [[South India]] and [[Muktinath|Saligrama]], [[Naimisaranya]], [[Pushkar]] and [[Badrinath Temple]] in [[North India]].{{sfn|Symbol}}

=== Vaishnava scholarship ===
Many of the medieval Sri Vaishanava scholars like [[Nathamuni]], [[Vedanta Desika]] and [[Ramanuja]] are associated with the temple.{{sfn|V.|1974|p=22}} Ramanuja was a [[theologian]], philosopher, and [[scriptural]] [[exegete]]. He is seen by [[Sri Vaishnavism|{{IAST|Śrīvaiṣṇavas}}]] as the third and most important teacher (''ācārya'') of their tradition (after [[Nathamuni]] and [[Yamunacharya]]), and by [[Hindus]] in general as the leading expounder of [[Vishishtadvaita|{{IAST|Viśiṣṭādvaita}}]], one of the classical interpretations of the dominant [[Vedanta]] school of [[Hindu philosophy]]. Ramanuja renounced his family life and went to [[Srirangam]] to occupy the pontificate&amp;nbsp;– [[Srirangam]] became the stronghold of him and his disciples.{{sfn|Narasimhachary | 2004| p= 23}} 

[[File:Shri Ramanujar pics 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ramanuja]]charya shrine image in Ranganathaswamy temple.]]
[[File:Sri Ramanuja Shrine at The Ranganathasamy Temple in Srirangam.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Sri Ramanuja Shrine at The Ranganathasamy Temple in Srirangam]]
The doctrine of Vishishtadvaita philosophy, ''Sri Bhashyam'' was written and later compiled by Ramanuja over a period of time in this temple town.{{sfn|Dasgupta|1991|p=114}} During his stay in Srirangam, he is said of have written "Gadhya Thrayam", which is recited in the temple during the ninth day (''Panguni Uttaram'') of the festival of ''Adi brahmotsavam''. The temple is a center for the ''Vishishtadvaita'' school where [[Sanskrit]] [[Vedas]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]] works are preached and taught with great reverence. He attained divinity in Srirangam. His ''Thaan-ana Thirumeni'' (the symbolic body) is preserved and offered prayers even today after eight centuries. The disciples of Ramanuja got his permission to install three metallic images, one each at [[Sriperumpudur]], [[Melukote]] and the third, at Srirangam.{{sfn|Narasimhachary | 2004| p= 37}} The shrine is found in the fourth ''prakaram'' (outer courtyard) of the temple and the idol is preserved in the temple by applying saffron and camphor every six months in a ritualistic style. He is found seated in the [[Lotus position|Padmasana]] (yogic sitting posture), depicting the ''Gnyana-Mudrai'' (symbol of knowledge) with his right palm. "Kovil Ozhugu" is a codification of all temple practices, religious and administrative, shaped and institutionalised by Sri Ramanuja after receiving the due rights from Sri Thiruvarangathamudanar. A stone inscription to this effect is installed in the ''Arya patal vasal'' (main gate before the first precinct).{{sfn|Govindāchārya|1906|p=208}}

[[Pancharanga Kshetrams]] (also called ''Pancharangams'', meaning the "five Rangams or Ranganathas") is a group of five sacred [[Hindu temples]], dedicated to [[Ranganatha]], a form of the god [[Vishnu]], on the banks of the [[Kaveri]] River. The five Pancharanga Kshetrams in the order of their successive locations, on the banks of the Kaveri River are: The [[Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple (Srirangapatna)|Srirangapatnam]] called the Adi Ranga, the first temple on the banks of the Kaveri River from the upstream side; the Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple at Srirangam known as Adya Ranga (the last temple), Appalarangam or [[Koviladi]] at Tiruppernagar in Tamil Nadu, [[Parimala Ranganatha Perumal Temple]] or Mayuram at Indalur, [[Mayiladuthurai]] and [[Kazheesirama Vinnagaram|Vatarangam]] at [[Sirkazhi]]. The [[Sarangapani temple]] at [[Kumbakonam]] is mentioned in place of Vatarangam in some references.{{sfn|Kapoor|2002}}{{sfn|Dalal|2011|p=339}}

The gate is open only during the ten days of ''Ra Pathu'' (10 day night-time festival). On the last day of the festival, the poet Nammazhwar is said to be given salvation. The performance is enacted by priests and images in the temple depicts Nammazhwar as reaching heaven and getting liberation from the cycle of life and death. At that point, a member from the crowd of devotees, who are witnessing this passion play, goes up to the centre stage and requests Vishnu to return Nammazhwar to humanity, so that his words and form in the temple will continue to inspire and save the devotees. Following this performance of the salvation of Nammazhwar, the cantors are taken in procession round the temple.{{sfn|Mittal|Thursby|2005|p=474}}

'''''Sharanagati Gadyam''''' is a [[Sanskrit]] [[prayer]] written by the [[Srivaishnavism]] philosopher [[Ramanujacharya]] towards the end of the 11th century. It is one of the first ''[[bhakti]]'' prayers in this school of thought and is the basis for many prayers, like ''Raghuveera gadyam'' of this style. It is recited in the 108 ''[[divya desam]]'' temples including [[Srirangam]].

==Context==
Ramanuja and his disciples visited the Ranganatha temple in Shrirangam on ''panguni uttiram'', a day in the [[tamil calendar]] month of ''panguni'' (in spring) on the day of the ascension of the star called [[Uttiram]].  In Tamil mythology, Uttiram was in ascent when the goddess of the temple, Sri Ranganayaki Tayar, [[Lakshmi]], was born and also the day she wed the god, [[Ranganatha]]. Ramanuja was inspired by the festivities of the day and composed [[Sriranga Gadyam]] and Sharanagati Gadyam and [[Vaikuntha Gadyam]].

==Content==
Sharanagati Gadyam, unlike the commentaries of Ramanuja on Vedanta, does not have detailed philosophical debates. Instead, it is a pure expression of ''bhakti'' and describes transcendental conversation between Ramanuja and [[Narayana]] with Sri also known as [[Lakshmi]]. He first describes the limitless kindness of Sri and asks that she recommend him to Narayana. Then, after her approval, he approaches Narayana and describes Him like in the Sriranga Gadyam. He explains that he has committed many sins and is ignorant of philosophy and asks that he be accepted into the list of devotees of Narayana. He only asks that he be blessed so he becomes a supreme devotee, never forgetting to serve Narayana. Pleased by his humility and his total surrender, Shri and Narayana bless him that his single act of surrender wiped his [[Karma]] and give him ''[[Moksha]]''.
 
==Style==
Prose, alternate long and short sentences with many adjectival phrases.

'''Scindia''' (anglicized from [[Shinde]] and also spelled as '''Scindhia''', '''Sindhia''', '''Sindia''') is a [[Hindu]] [[Maratha]] dynasty that ruled the [[Gwalior State]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Indian Princes and their States |series=The New Cambridge History of India |first=Barbara N. |last=Ramusack |authorlink=Barbara Ramusack |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2004 |isbn=9781139449083 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kz1-mtazYqEC&amp;pg=PA35 |page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gwalior state was a part of the [[Maratha Confederacy]] in the 18th and 19th centuries, and a [[princely state]] of the colonial [[British Raj|British government]] during the 19th and the 20th centuries. After India's independence in 1947, the members of the Scindia family became politicians.

The Scindia family of [[Kanherkhed]] originally served as [[shiledar]]s (cavalrymen) under the [[Bahmani Sultanate]].&lt;ref name="Eaton2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard M.

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2012}}
[[File:Weeks Edwin Lord The Maharahaj of Gwalior Before His Palace.jpg|thumb|left|The Maharahaj of Gwalior Before His Palace]]
The Scindia dynasty was founded by [[Ranoji Scindia]], who was the son of Jankojirao Scindia, the Deshmukh of [[Kanherkhed]], a village in [[Satara District]], [[Maharashtra]]. [[Peshwa]] [[Baji Rao I|Baji Rao]]'s career saw the strengthening of the [[Maratha Empire]]. Ranoji was in charge of the [[Maratha Empire|Maratha]] conquests in [[Malwa]] in 1726. Ranoji established his capital at [[Ujjain]] in 1731. His successors included Jayajirao, Jyotibarao, Dattajirao, Jankojirao, [[Mahadji Shinde]] and [[Daulatrao Scindia]]. The [[Gwalior State|Scindhia state of Gwalior]] became a major regional power in the latter half of the 18th century and figured prominently in the three [[Anglo-Maratha Wars]]. They held sway over many of the [[Rajput]] states, and conquered north India.

After the defeat of the allied Maratha states by the British in the [[Third Anglo-Maratha War]] of 1818, Daulatrao Scindia was forced to accept local autonomy as a [[princely state]] within [[British India]] and to give up Ajmer to the British. After the death of Daulatrao, Maharani Baiza Bai ruled the empire, saving it from the British power, till the adopted child Jankoji Rao took over the charge. Jankoji died in 1843, and his widow Tarabai Raje scindia successfully maintained the position and adopted a child from close lineage named Jayajirao.

The Scindia family ruled Gwalior until India's independence from the [[United Kingdom]] in 1947, when the [[Maharaja]] [[Jivajirao Scindia]] acceded to the Government of India. Gwalior was merged with a number of other princely states to become the new Indian [[States and territories of India|state]] of [[Madhya Bharat]]. George Jivajirao served as the state's [[rajpramukh]], or appointed governor, from 28 May 1948 to 31 October 1956, when Madhya Bharat was merged into [[Madhya Pradesh]].

In 1962, [[Rajmata Vijayraje Scindia]], the widow of Maharaja Jiwajirao, was elected to the [[Lok Sabha]], beginning the family's career in electoral politics. She was first a member of the [[Indian National Congress|Congress Party]], and later became an influential member of the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]]. Her son [[Madhavrao Scindia]] was elected to the Lok Sabha in 1971 representing the Congress Party, and served until his death in 2001. His son, [[Jyotiraditya Scindia]], also in the Congress Party, was elected to the seat formerly held by his father in 2004.

Vijayaraje's daughters have supported the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]]. [[Vasundhara Raje Scindia]] contested and won five [[Indian Parliament|parliamentary]] elections from [[Madhya Pradesh]] and [[Rajasthan]]. Under the Vajpayee government from 1998 onwards, Vasundhara was in charge of several different ministries. In 2003 she led the Bharatiya Janata Party to its largest majority in [[Rajasthan]], and became the state's [[Chief Minister]]. In 2013 again, she led Bharatiya Janata Party to a thumpin win in the state of Rajasthan, winning over 160 out of the 200 seats in the assembly elections. Her other daughter, [[Yashodhara Raje Scindia]], contested assembly elections from [[Shivpuri]] in Madhya Pradesh and won in 1998, 2003 and 2013 and also lokshabha 2004,2009 from gwalior. Upon the BJP's win in the state, she became the state's Minister for Tourism, Sports and Youth Affairs. Vasundhara's son [[Dushyant Singh]] entered the Lok Sabha in 2004 from Rajasthan.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2508">'''Surkhab II''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]:سهراب دوم) was the fourth ruler of the [[Bavand dynasty]] from 755 to 772. In 760, his overlord, the [[Dabuyids]], under [[Khurshid of Tabaristan]], revolted against the [[Abbasid Caliphate]]. Khurshid, was, however, defeated, and fled to [[Daylam]], where he made a counterattack against the Abbasids, but was once again defeated. After learning that his family was captured by the Abbasids, Khurshid poisoned himself.&lt;ref name="EI2"&gt;Rekaya (1986), pp. 68–70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Madelung200"&gt;Madelung (1975), p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pourshariati317"&gt;Pourshariati (2008), p. 317&lt;/ref&gt; This marked the end of the Dabuyid dynasty, however, other dynasties such as the Bavandids, [[House of Karen|Karenids]] and [[Zarmihrids]], who were all formerly subject to the Dabuyids, continued to control parts of Tabaristan as tributary vassals of the Abbasid government. Surkhab II died in 772, and was succeeded by his son [[Sharwin I]], who would later along with the rulers of [[Tabaristan]] revolt against the Abbasids and massacre all the Muslims in Tabaristan.&lt;ref name="MadelungBavand"&gt;Madelung (1984), pp. 747–753&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tenrikyo Doyusha''' (天理教道友社 ''Tenrikyō Dōyūsha'') is the official publisher of [[Tenrikyo Church Headquarters]], disseminating news, information, and doctrinal materials related to [[Tenrikyo]].

==History==
[[File:Michi no tomo first edition.jpg|thumb|150px|Cover of the first edition of ''Michi no tomo'' (1891).]]
Tenrikyo Doyusha was founded on August 4, 1891, following a direction from spiritual leader [[Iburi Izō]] requesting that "a periodical should be published under the auspices of the Tenrikyo Church."&lt;ref&gt;The Headquarters of Tenrikyo Church (1956). ''The Short History of Tenrikyo.'' Nara, Japan: Tenri Jihosha. 238.&lt;/ref&gt; The periodical ''Michi no tomo'' (みちのとも "Friends of the Path") was first published in December 28 of the same year.&lt;ref&gt;''The Short History of Tenrikyo,'' 238.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Meiji period|Meiji]] and [[Taishō period|Taisho]] periods, ''Michi no tomo'' was the only periodical issued by Tenrikyo Doyusha.&lt;ref&gt;''The Short History of Tenrikyo,'' 239.&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 18, 1930, the first issue of ''Tenri Jiho'' (天理時報 "Tenri Times") was published by [[Tenri Central Library]] as a commemorative issue celebrating the opening of the library. For several months ''Tenri Jiho'' was simply a bulletin for the library, but on July 2, 1931, the responsibility of its publication was transferred to Tenrikyo Doyusha, where it has since taken a newspaper format.&lt;ref&gt;Tenrikyo Overseas Mission Department (1998). ''Tenrikyo: The Path to Joyousness.'' Tenri, Japan: Tenri Jihosha. 135–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ambrosian Rite]] is a Latin [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Catholic Liturgical Rites|liturgical Western Rite]] used in the area of [[Milan]]. The '''Traditional Ambrosian Rite''' is the form of this rite as it was used before the changes that followed the [[Second Vatican Council]].

Nowadays the Traditional Ambrosian Rite is mainly used on Sundays and Holy Days of Obligation in the church of ''Santa Maria della Consolazione'' in [[Milan]], using the Ambrosian [[Missal]] of 1954, as permitted by Cardinal Archbishop of [[Milan]] [[Carlo Maria Martini]] on 31 July 1985. Another celebration on Sundays and Holy Days of Obligation was authorized from 18 October 2008 onward in the town of [[Legnano]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.ilgiornale.it/tornielli/2008/10/17/nuova-messa-in-rito-ambrosiano-antico/ Newspaper ''Il Giornale'': Blog di Antonio Tornielli, 17 October 2008]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Traditional Ambrosian Rite Mass may be said according to the Motu Proprio "Summorum Pontificum"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilgiornale.it/milano/la_messa_antica_si_puo_celebrare_anche_milano/31-05-2009/articolo-id=355326 Newspaper ''Il Giornale'': Blog di Antonio Tornielli, 31 maggio 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; thus any permissions allowing the above-mentioned Masses should be considered obsolete for such permissions from the bishop are no longer required.

== The liturgical year==
The [[liturgical year]] of the Ambrosian Rite begins the First Sunday of [[Advent]], which however takes place 2 weeks earlier than in the [[Roman Rite]], so that there are six Sundays in Advent, and the key-day of the beginning of Advent is not [[St. Andrew's Day]] (30 November) but [[St. Martin's Day]] (11 November), which begins the [[Sanctorale]]. The same is true for the [[Mozarabic Rite]].

On the sixth Sunday of Advent the [[Annunciation]] (in Roman Rite on 25 March) is celebrated. As no fixed festivals are kept during Lent or Easter Week, it cannot be celebrated on 25 March, though it is found there in the Calendar and has an Office in the Breviary. On this Sunday there are two Masses, one of the Advent and another one of the Incarnation. This day may be compared with the Mozarabic feast of the [[Annunciation]] on 18 December.

[[Christmas Day]] has three Masses, during the night, at dawn, and during the day, as in the Roman Rite. The day after the Epiphany is the "Christophoria" (the [[Flight into Egypt#Return from Egypt|Return from Egypt]]). The Sundays after the Epiphany vary, of course, in number, six being the maximum, as in the Roman Rite. The second is the [[Feast of the Holy Name of Jesus]]. Then follow [[Septuagesima]], [[Sexagesima]], and [[Quinquagesima]] Sundays, on which, though Gloria in Excelsis and Hallelujah are used, the vestments are violet.

There is no [[Ash Wednesday]], and [[Lent]] begins liturgically on the first Sunday, the fast beginning on the Monday. Until the time of St. Charles Borromeo the liturgical Lent, with its use of litanies on Sundays instead of Gloria in Excelsis and the disuse of Hallelujah, began on the Monday. The title of the Sunday is ''Dominica in capite Quadragesimæ''. The other Sundays of Lent are styled ''De Samaritanâ'', ''De Abraham'', ''De Cæco'', ''De Lazaro'', and ''in Ramis Palmarum'' or ''Dominica Olivarum'' ([[Palm Sunday]]). The names of the second to the fifth Sundays are in allusion to the subject of the Gospel of the day, not, as in the Roman Rite, to the Introit. (Cf. nomenclature of [[Greek Rite]].) [[Passiontide]] does not begin until Holy Week. The day before Palm Sunday is [[Sabbatum in Traditione Symboli]]. This, the [[Blessing of the Font]], the extra Masses pro Baptizatis in Ecclesiâ Hyemali on Easter Eve and every day of Easter Week, and the name of the first Sunday after Easter ''in albis depositis'', show even more of a lingering memory of the old Easter Baptisms than the similar survivals in the Roman Rite. Holy Week is [[Hebdomada Authentica]]. [[Maundy Thursday|Holy Thursday]], [[Good Friday]], [[Easter Eve]], and Easter Day are named as in the Roman Rite.

The five Sundays after Easter, [[Ascension of Jesus Christ|Ascension]], [[Pentecost]], [[Trinity Sunday]], and [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]] follow, as in the Roman Rite, but the ''Triduum Litaniarum'' ([[Rogation Days]]) comes on the Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday after, instead of before, Ascension Day. The Sundays after Pentecost are designated as such (e.g. 3rd Sunday after Pentecost) until the [[Decollation of St. John]] (29 August). There may be as many as fifteen of them. Then follow either four or five Sundays called ''post Decollationem S. Joannis Baptistæ'', then three Sundays of October, the third of which is the feast of the Dedication of Milan Cathedral. The rest of the Sundays until Advent are called ''post Dedicationem''.

The Calendar of the Saints calls for little notice. There are many local saints, and several feasts which are given in the Roman Calendar in late February, March, and early April are given on other days, because of the rule against feasts in Lent. Only St. Joseph and the Annunciation come in the Lenten part of the Calendar, but the Masses of these are given on 12 December and the sixth Sunday of Advent respectively. The days are classified as follows:

# Solemnitates Domini
#*First Class: the Annunciation, Christmas Day, Epiphany, Easter Day with its Monday and Tuesday, Ascension Day, Pentecost, with its Monday and Tuesday, Corpus Domini, the Dedication of the Cathedral or of the local church, Solemnitas Domini titularis propriæ Ecclesiæ.
#*First class, secondary: the [[Feast of the Sacred Heart]].
#*Second class: the Visitation, [[Feast of the Circumcision of Christ|Circumcision]], [[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple|Purification]], [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]], [[Invention of the Cross]], Trinity Sunday.
#*Second class, secondary: the [[Name of Jesus]], the [[Holy Family]], the [[Exaltation of the Cross]]. The Octaves of Christmas, Epiphany, Easter Day, Pentecost and Corpus Domini also count as Solemnitates Domini.
# Sundays
# Solemnia B. M. V. et Sanctorum
#*First class: the [[Immaculate Conception]], [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]], [[Nativity of St. John the Baptist]], St. Joseph, [[Saints Peter and Paul]], All Saints, the [[Ambrose|Ordination of St. Ambrose]], and the Patron of the local church.
#*Second class: other feasts of Our Lady, St. Michael and the Archangels, and the Guardian Angels, [[Decollation of St. John]], Feasts of Apostles and Evangelists, St. Anne, St. Charles Borromeo, the [[Holy Innocents]], [[Joachim|St. Joachim]], [[Lawrence of Rome|St. Laurence]], St. Martin, Saints [[Nazarius and Celsus]], [[Protasius and Gervasius|Saints Protasius and Gervasius]], St. Stephen, [[St. Thomas of Canterbury]].
#*Second class, secondary: the [[two Chairs of St. Peter]], the [[Conversion of St. Paul]].
# Solemnia Majora: St. Agatha, St. Agnes, St. Anthony, [[Apollinaris of Ravenna|St. Apollinaris]], St. Benedict, St. Dominic, the Translations of Saints Ambrose, Protasius, and Gervasius, St. Francis, St. Mary Magdalene, Sts. Nabor and Felix, St. Sebastian, St. Victor, St. Vincent.
# Alia Solemnia are days noted as such in the Calendar, and the days of saints whose bodies or important relics are preserved in any particular church become Solemnia for that church.
# Non-Solemnia Privilegiata
# Non-Solemnia Simplicia

Feasts are also grouped into four classes: First class of Solemnitates Domini and Solemnia; second class of the same; greater and ordinary Solemnia; non-Solemnia, divided into privilegiata and simplicia. Solemnia have two [[vespers]], non-Solemnia only one, the first. The privilegiata have certain propria and the simplicia only the communia. The general principle of occurrences is that common to the whole Western Church. If two festivals fall on the same day, the lesser is either transferred, merely commemorated, or omitted. But the Ambrosian Rite differs materially from the Roman in the rank given to Sunday, which is only superseded by a Solemnitas Domini, and not always then, for if the Name of Jesus or the Purification falls on Septuagesima, Sexagesima, or Quinquagesima Sunday, it is transferred, though the distribution and procession of candles takes place on the Sunday on which the Purification actually falls. If a Solemne Sanctorum or a privileged non-Solemne falls on a Sunday, a Solemnitas Domini, the Friday or Saturday of the fourth or fifth week of Advent, a Feria de Exceptato, within an Octave of a great Feast, a Feria Litaniarum, or a Feria of Lent, the whole office is of the Sunday, Solemnitas Domini, etc., and the Solemne or non-Solemne privilegiatum is transferred, in most cases to the next clear day, but in the case of Solemnia of the first or second class to the next Feria, quocumque festo etiam solemni impedita. A simple non-Solemne is never transferred, but it is omitted altogether if a Solemne of the first class falls on the same day, and in other cases of occurrences it is commemorated, though of course it supersedes an ordinary Feria. The concurrences of the first Vespers of one feast with the second of another are arranged on much the same principle, the chief peculiarity being that if a Solemne Sanctorum falls on a Monday its first Vespers is kept not on the Sunday, but on the preceding Saturday, except in Advent, when this rule applies only to Solemnia of the first and second class, and other Solemnia are only commemorated at Sunday Vespers. The liturgical colours of the Ambrosian Rite are very similar to those of the Roman, the most important differences being that (except when some greater day occurs) red is used on the Sundays and Feriæ after Pentecost and the Decollation of St. John until the Eve of the Dedication (third Sunday in October), on Corpus Christi and its Octave, and during Holy Week, except on Good Friday, as well as on the days on which it is used in the Roman Rite, and that (with similar exceptions) green is only used from the Octave of the Epiphany to the eve of Septuagesima, from Low Sunday to the Friday before Pentecost, after the Dedication to Advent, and on feasts of abbots.

== The Divine Office==

===The distribution of the Psalter ===

The Ambrosian distribution of the Psalter is partly fortnightly and partly weekly. Psalms 1 to 108 are divided into ten decuriæ, one of which, in its numerical order, divided into three [[Nocturns]], is recited at [[Matins]] on the Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays of each fortnight, each Nocturn being said under one antiphon. At the Matins of Sunday and Solemnitates Domini and on Feriæ in Easter and Pentecost weeks and the octave of Corpus Christi, there are no psalms, but three Old Testament canticles, Isaias 26, ''De nocte vigilatâ''; the Canticle of Anna (1 Kings 2), ''Confirmatum est''; and the Canticle of Jonas, ''Clamavi ad Dominum'', or of Habacuc, ''Domine audivi''. And on Saturdays the Canticle of Moses (Exod. 15), ''Cantemus Domino'', and half of Psalm 118 take the place of Decuriæ at the three Nocturns.

At Vespers, Psalms 109 to 147, except 117, 118, and 133, which are used elsewhere, and 142, which is only used in the Office of the Dead and as Psalmus Directus at Lauds on Fridays, are divided between the whole seven days of each week in their numerical sequence, and in the same manner as in the Roman Rite.

Psalm 118, besides being used on Saturdays, is distributed among the four lesser Hours exactly as in the Roman Rite; Psalm 50 is said at Lauds every day except Sunday, when the [[Benedicite]] takes its place, and Saturday, when Psalm 117, takes its place, and with the [[Preces]] (when these are used) at Prime and Terce throughout the year and at None during Lent, while at the Preces of Sext Psalm 53 is said, and at those of None Psalm 85, except during Lent. Psalm 53 precedes ''Beati immaculati'' at Prime, and Psalms 4, 30, V. 1-6, 90 and 133 are said daily, as in the Roman Rite, at Compline.

At Lauds a single Psalm, known as Psalmus Directus, differing with the day of the week, is also said.

During Lent Psalm 90 is said as [[Psalmus Directus]] at Vespers, except on Sundays, Fridays, and Saturdays, and the "Four Verses of a Psalm" at Lauds on Saturdays are alternately from the twelfth and first parts of Ps. 118, and on the six Sundays the "Four Verses" are from 69, 101, 62, 58. During Lent also the Vesper "Four Verses" are different for every day, except that there are none on Friday, and those on the first four Saturdays are from Ps. 91. In Holy Week the Psalms at the Nocturns and at Vespers are all proper, and there are also proper Psalms during the period from the first Feria de Exceptato until the Circumcision; and on the Annunciation (sixth Sunday of Advent), Epiphany, Christophoria, Name of Jesus, Ascension, Corpus Christi, the Dedication and many Solemnia Sanctorum, and on many other saints' days the Decuriœ are superseded by Psalms of the [[common (liturgy) Common of Saints]].

===Other details of the Divine Office ===

Antiphonœ, similar in construction to those in the Roman Rite are: in Psalmis et canticis, used as in the Roman Rite; in Choro, said after the Lucernarium on Sundays, at the second Vespers of Solemnia, or on other saints' days, at first Vespers, but not on Feriœ, except Saturdays in Advent; ad Crucem, said on Solemnitates Domini, on Sundays, except in Lent, and on Solemnia. Responsoria are constructed as in the Roman Rite, and are: Post hymnum, said after the hymn at Matins; Inter lectiones at Matins; cum Infantibus or cum Pueris after the hymn at the first Vespers of Solemnia; in Choro, said at Vespers on Sundays, at the second Vespers of Solemnia, and at the first of Non-Solemnia, after the hymn; in Baptisterio, at Lauds and Vespers of some Solemnitates after the first Psallenda, on Feriœ after the twelve Kyries, at Vespers after the prayer which follows Magnificat; Diaconalia or Quadragesimalia, on Wednesdays in Lent and on Good Friday; ad Cornu Altaris, at Lauds before the Psalmus Directus on Christmas Day, the Epiphany, and Easter Eve; Gradualia, said after the hymn at Lauds on Feriœ in Lent. Lucernaria are Responsoria which begin Vespers. Psallendœ are single verses, often from the Psalms, said after the twelve Kyries and the second prayer at Lauds, and after the prayers at Vespers. They are variable according to the day, and are followed by either one or two fixed Complenda or Completoria, which are also single verses. Psalmi Directi are said at Lauds and sometimes at Vespers. They are sung together by both choirs, not antiphonally. Psalmi Quatuor Versus is the name given to four verses of a psalm said at Vespers and Lauds on weekdays, after one of the Collects. Among the Hymns, besides those by St. Ambrose, or commonly attributed to him, many are included by other authors, such as Prudentius, Venantius Fortunatus, St. Gregory, St. Thomas Aquinas, and many whose authorship is unknown. A considerable number of well-known hymns (e. g. "Ave Maris Stella", "[[A Solis Ortus Cardine]]", "Jesu Redemptor Omnium," "[[Iste confessor]]") are not in the Ambrosian Hymnal, but there are many there which are not in the Roman, and those that are common to both generally appear as they were before the revisions of Urban VIII, though some have variants of their own. Capitula are short lessons of Scripture used as in the Roman Rite. At the Lesser Hours and Compline Capitula taken from the Epistles are called Epistolellœ.

===Construction of the Divine Office ===

(The constantly occurring [[Dominus vobiscum]], etc., has been omitted in this analysis.) 
* [[Matins]]: [[Lord's Prayer|Pater noster]]; [[Hail Mary|Ave Maria]]; [[Deus in adjutorium]]; [[Gloria Patri]]; Hallelujah or Laus tibi.

During Lent, except on Saturdays and Sundays, there are two lessons (from Genesis and Proverbs) after Terce; and on Wednesdays and Fridays of Lent and on Feriœ de Exceptato litanies are said then.

== The Mass==
The Ambrosian Mass in its present form is best shown by an analysis pointing out the differences from the [[Tridentine Mass]]. As a great part of it agrees word for word with the Roman, it will only be necessary to indicate the agreements, without giving the passages in full. There are a certain number of ceremonial differences, the most noticeable of which are: 
* When the deacon and sub-deacon are not occupied, they take up positions at the north and south ends of the altar facing each other.
* The Prophecy, [[Epistle]], and [[Gospel (reading)|Gospel]] are read, in Milan Cathedral, from the great [[pulpit|ambon]] on the north side of the choir, and the procession thereto is accompanied with some state.
* The offering of bread and wine by the men and women of the Scuola di S. Ambrogio.
* The filing past and kissing the north corner of the altar at the Offertory.
* The silent [[Lavabo]] just before the Consecration.
* The absence of bell-ringing at the Elevation.

In the rubrics of the Missal there are certain survivals of ancient usage which could only have applied to the city of Milan itself, and may be compared with the "stations" affixed to certain Masses in the Roman Missal of to-day. The Ambrosian Rite supposes the existence of two cathedrals, the [[Basilica Major]] or ''Ecclesia Æstiva]'' ("summer church"), and the [[Basilica Minor]] or ''Ecclesia Hiemalis'' ("winter church"). Lejay, following Giulini, calls the Ecclesia Major (St. Mary's) the winter church, and St. Thecla the summer church (Cabrol, Dictionnaire d'archéologie chrétienne, col. 1382 sqq.), but Ecclesia Hiematis and Ecclesia Major in the "Bergamo Missal", and Ecclesia Hiemalis and Ad Sanctam Mariam, in all missals, are evidently contrasted with one another. Also the will of Berengarius I, founding St. Rafaele (quoted by Giulini, I, 416) speaks of the latter being near the summer church, which it is, if the summer church is St. Mary's. There is also assumed to be a detached baptistery and a Chapel of the Cross, though mentions of these are found chiefly in the Breviary, and in earlier times the church of St. Laurence was the starting point of the Palm Sunday ceremonies. The greater, or summer, church, under the patronage of Our Lady, is now the Cathedral; the lesser, or winter, church, which stood at the opposite end of the Piazza del Duomo, and was destroyed in 1543, was under the patronage of St. Thecla. As late as the time of Beroldus (twelfth century) the changes from one to the other were made at Easter and at the Dedication of the Great Church (third Sunday in October), and even now the rubric continues to order two Masses on certain great days, one in each church, and on Easter Eve and through Easter week one Mass is ordered daily pro baptizatis in Ecclesia Hiemali, and another, according to the Bergamo book, in Ecclesia Majori. The modern books say '' in omni ecclesiâ''. There were two baptisteries, both near the greater church.

== The Occasional Services ==
Of the services in the Ritual and Pontifical there is not much to say. The ceremonies of [[Baptism]] differ in their order from those of the Roman Rite. The Ambrosian order is: renunciation; ephphatha; sufflation; unction; exorcism and second sufflation; signing with the Cross; delivery of the salt; introduction into the church; Creed and Lord's Prayer; declaration of faith; Baptism, for which the rubric is: Ter occiput mergit in aqua in crucis formam (and, as Legg points out, the Ambrosians boast that their baptism is always by immersion); litany; anointing with chrism; delivery of white robe and candle; dismissal. A great part of the wording is exactly the same as the Roman.

The order of the [[Anointing of the Sick (Catholic Church)|Unction of the Sick]] shows the progress of Roman influence in modern times. The service at present used differs very little except at one point from that given by Magistretti (Mon. Vet., II, 79, 94, 147) from early Manuscripts, and from the form in the undated printed Ritual of the late fifteenth century, but the difference at that point is no less than the introduction of the Roman manner and words of anointing. The old Ambrosian Rite was to anoint the sick person on the breast, the hands, and the feet, with the words: "Ungo te oleo sanctificato, more militis unctus et preparatus ad luctam aerias possis catervas. Operare creatura olei, in nomine+Dei Patris omnipotentis+et Filii+et Spiritus Sancti, ut non lateat spiritus immundus nec in membris nec in medullis nec in ulla compagine membrorum hujus hominis [vel mulieris] sed operetur in eo virtus Christi Filii Altissimi qui cum æterno Patri... . Amen." Then, "Quidquid peccasti per cogitationem cordis [per operationem manuum vel per ingressum pedum] parcat tibi Deus. Amen." The fifteenth-century printed Ritual varies the first anointing. Instead of "Quidquid peccasti", it reads, "Per istam unctionem et cristi sacratissimam passionem si quid peccasti, etc.", the other two being as in the older books. The Ungo te, etc., is repeated with each. A somewhat similar form, but shorter, with the anointing of the five senses and reading Ungimus for Ungo, is given in Harl. Manuscript 2990, an early fifteenth-century North Italian fragment, and in the Venetian printed pre-Tridontine Rituals, a form very like the last (but reading Ungo) with the same anointings as in the Roman Rite, is given as the rite of the Patriarchate of Venice. This form, or something very like it, with the seven anointings is found in the Asti Ritual described by Gastoué. In the modern Ambrosian Ritual the Roman seven anointings and the form, Per istam unctionem, etc., are taken over bodily and the Ungo te has disappeared.

The differences in the [[Order of Matrimony]] are very slight, and the other contents of the Ritual call for no special remark. In the ninth-century Pontifical published by Magistretti the consecration of a church includes the solemn entry, the writing of the ABCturium, with the cambutta (that Gaelic word, cam bata, crooked staff, which is commonly used in Gallican books), the blessing and mixture of salt, water, ashes, and wine, the sprinkling and anointing of the church and the altar, the blessing of various utensils, and at the end the deposition of the relics. The order given by Mercati from an eleventh-century Manuscript at Lucca differs from the ninth-century form in that there is a circumambulation and sprinkling, with the signing of the cross on the door, the writing of an alphabet per parietem and the making of three crosses on each wall with chrism, before the entry, and there is no deposition of relics. There are also considerable differences of wording. The ordinations in the ninth-century Manuscript are of the same mixed Roman and Gallican type, but are less developed than those of the modern Roman Pontifical.

'''Trisong Detsen''' or '''Trisong Detsän'''{{Citation needed|reason=show source for this spelling in English|date=May 2017}} ({{bo|t=ཁྲི་སྲོང་ལྡེ་བཙན|w=khri srong lde btsan|l=ʈʂʰisoŋ tetsɛ̃}}) was the son of [[Me Agtsom]] and the 38th [[List of emperors of Tibet|emperor of Tibet]]. He ruled from AD 755 until 797 or 804. Trisong Detsen was the second of the Three Dharma Kings of Tibet, playing a pivotal role in the introduction of [[Buddhism]] to [[Tibet]] and the establishment of the [[Nyingma]] or "Ancient" school of [[Tibetan Buddhism]].

The empire Trisong Detsen inherited had declined somewhat from its greatest extent under the first Dharma King, [[Songtsen Gampo]]. Disintegration continued when, in 694, Tibet lost control of several cities in [[Turkestan]] and, in 703, [[Nepal]] broke into rebellion. Meanwhile, [[Arabs|Arab]] forces vied for influence along the western border lands of the Tibetan empire.

==Trisong Detsen and his support for Buddhism==
{{Tibetan Buddhism}}
Trisong Detsen is very important to the history of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] as one of the three 'Dharma Kings' (Tibetan:''chosgyal'') who established [[Buddhism]] in [[Tibet]]. The Three Dharma Kings were [[Songtsän Gampo|Songtsen Gampo]], Trisong Detsen, and [[Ralpacan]].

The ''Skar-cung'' pillar erected by [[Sadnalegs]] (ruled c. 800-815) says that during the reign of Trisong Detsen, "shrines of the [[Three Jewels]] were established by building temples at the centre and on the borders, ''Bsam-yas'' in ''Brag-mar'' and so on".&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, Hugh. ''A Corpus of Early Tibetan Inscriptions'' (1981), p. 75. Royal Asiatic Society, London. {{ISBN|0-947593-00-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The first edict of Trisong Detsen already mentions a community of monks at ''Bsam-yas'' ([[Samye]]).&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, C. I. "The Revolt of 755 in Tibet", p. 3 note 7. In: ''Weiner Studien zur Tibetologie und Buddhismuskunde''. Nos. 10-11. [Ernst Steinkellner and Helmut Tauscher, eds. ''Proceedings of the Csoma de Kőrös Symposium Held at Velm-Vienna, Austria, 13–19 September 1981''. Vols. 1-2.] Vienna, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indian traditions===
Trisong became emperor in 755 and, in post-imperial sources, is claimed to have invited [[Padmasambhava]], [[Śāntarakṣita]], [[Vimalamitra]], and various other [[India]]n teachers to come to Tibet to spread the latest understanding of the teaching.  The two pandits began by establishing [[Samye]] as the first [[vihara]] in Tibet.  Several Tibetans were eventually initiated as monks and a vast translation project was undertaken translating the Buddhist scriptures from [[Sanskrit]] into [[Classical Tibetan]].&lt;ref&gt;Stein, R. A. (1972) ''Tibetan Civilization'', p. 66. Stanford University Press. {{ISBN|0-8047-0806-1}} (cloth); {{ISBN|0-8047-0901-7}} (pbk)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chinese traditions===
The first documented dissemination of [[Chan Buddhism]] to Tibet, chronicled in what has become known as the ''Statements of the Sba Family'', occurred in about 761 when Trisong Detsen sent a party to the [[Yi Province|Yizhou]] region to receive the teachings of [[Kim Hwasang]], a [[Koreans|Korean]] [[Zen master|Chan master]], who they encountered in [[Sichuan]]. The party received teachings and three Chinese texts from Kim, who died soon after.&lt;ref name="Ray, Gary L. 2007"&gt;Ray, Gary L.(2005). ''The Northern Ch'an School and Sudden Versus Gradual Enlightenment Debates in China and Tibet''.  Source: [http://www.dharmaweb.org/index.php/Ch'an_&amp;_Sudden_and_Gradual_Debates_in_China_and_Tibet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725081221/http://www.dharmaweb.org/index.php/Ch%27an_%26_Sudden_and_Gradual_Debates_in_China_and_Tibet |date=2008-07-25 }} (accessed: December 2, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Trisong Detsen patronised a second party to China in 763. This second expedition was headed by a high minister, Sba Gsalsnan. There is scholarly dissent about whom Gsalsnan encountered in Yizhou. Early scholarship considered Kim, but this had been revised to [[Baotang Wuzhu]] (714-774), head and founder of Baotang Monastery in [[Chengdu]]. Both Kim and Baotang Wuzhu were of the same school of Chan, the [[East Mountain Teaching]].&lt;ref name="Ray, Gary L. 2007"/&gt;

==Debates==
{{Main|Samye Debate}}
Trisong Detsen, hosted a famous two-year debate from 792-794, known in Western scholarship as the "Council of Lhasa" (although it took place at [[Samye]] at quite a distance from [[Lhasa]]) outside the capital. He sponsored a [[Dharma]] debate between the [[Chan Buddhism|Chan Buddhist]] [[Moheyan]], who represented the third documented wave of Chan dissemination in Tibet, and the scholar [[Kamalaśīla]], a student of [[Śāntarakṣita]]. Effectively the debate was between the Chinese and Indian Buddhist traditions as they were represented in Tibet.

Sources differ about both the nature of the debate as well as the victor. Stein (1972: p.&amp;nbsp;66-67) holds that Kamalaśīla disseminated a "gradualist approach" to enlightenment, consisting of purificatory [[sādhanā]] such as cultivating the [[pāramitā]]s. Kamalashila's role was to ordain Tibetans as Buddhist monks and propagate Buddhist philosophy as it had flourished in India.  Stein (1972: p.&amp;nbsp;66-67) holds that Kamalaśīla was victorious in the debate and that Trisong Detsän sided with Kamalaśīla.&lt;ref&gt;Stein, R. A. (1972) ''Tibetan Civilization'', pp. 66-67. Stanford University Press. {{ISBN|0-8047-0806-1}} (cloth); {{ISBN|0-8047-0901-7}} (pbk)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stupa construction===
Trisong Detsen is also traditionally associated with the construction of [[Boudhanath]]  in the [[Kathmandu]] Valley in [[Nepal]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Legend of the Great Stupa and The Life Story of the Lotus Born Guru'', pp. 21-29. Keith Dowman (1973). Tibetan Nyingma Meditation Center. Dharma Books. Berkeley, California.&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of [[Padmasambhava]] on the other hand was to establish the teaching of Buddhist [[Tantra]] in Tibet.  During the reign of Trisong Detsän the combined efforts of Padmasambhava, Śāntarakṣita and Kamalaśīla established both the Indian Buddhist philosophical interpretation and Buddhist tantra in Tibet.

==Political and military activities==
In 763 Trisong Detsen sent an army of 200,000 men to the border with Tang China, defeating the forces there and then continuing on to take [[Chang'an]], the Tang Chinese capital, forcing [[Emperor Daizong of Tang]] to flee the capital.&lt;ref&gt;Stein, R. A. (1972) ''Tibetan Civilization'', p. 65. Stanford University Press. {{ISBN|0-8047-0806-1}} (cloth); {{ISBN|0-8047-0901-7}} (pbk)&lt;/ref&gt; In 783 a peace treaty was negotiated between China and Tibet giving Tibet all lands in [[Qinghai]]. The Tang Empire had declined greatly due to the [[An Lushan Rebellion]] which was finally quelled in 763.

The King also formed an alliance with [[Nanzhao]] in 778, joining forces to attack the Chinese in [[Sichuan]].

Trisong Detsen next sought to expand westward, reaching the [[Amu Darya]] and threatening the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid Caliph]], [[Harun ar-Rashid]]. The Caliph was concerned enough to establish an alliance with the Chinese emperor. King Trosong Detsen would be preoccupied with Arab wars in the west, taking pressure off his Chinese opponents to the east and north, until his rule ended in 797.

==Retirement, death and succession==
Trisong Detsen had four sons: Mutri Tsenpo, [[Muné Tsenpo]], Mutik Tsenpo, and [[Sadnalegs]]. The eldest son, Mutri Tsenpo, died early.

Trisong Detsen retired to live at the palace at Zungkar and handed power to his second son, [[Muné Tsenpo]], in 797. From this point there is much confusion in the various historical sources. It seems there was a struggle for the succession after the death of Trisong Detsen. It is not clear when Trisong Detsen died, or for how long Mune Tsenpo reigned. The ''[[Testament of Ba]]'', a Tibetan historical text which may date back to the 9th century, claims that Muné Tsenpo insisted that his father's funeral be performed according to Buddhist rather than traditional rites.&lt;ref&gt;''dBa' bzhed: The Royal Narrative Concerning the Bringing of the Buddha's Doctrine to Tibet''. Translation and Facsimile Edition of the Tibetan Text by Pasang Wangdu and Hildegard Diemberger. Verlag der Österreichischen Akadamie der Wissenschafen, Wien 2000. {{ISBN|3-7001-2956-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is said that Mune Tsenpo was poisoned by his mother, who was jealous of his beautiful wife.&lt;ref&gt;Shakabpa, Tsepon W. D. ''Tibet: A Political History'' (1967), pp. 46-47. Yale University Press, New Haven and London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Ancient Tibet: Research Materials from The Yeshe De Project'', pp. 284, 290-291. Dharma Publishing, Berkeley, California. {{ISBN|0-89800-146-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whatever the case, both the ''[[Old Book of Tang]]'' and the Tibetan sources agree that, since Mune Tsenpo had no heirs, power passed to his younger brother, Sadnalegs, who was on the throne by 804 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Don Y. ''The History of Early Relations between China and Tibet: From Chiu t'ang-shu, a documentary survey'', p. 144, and n. 3. (1981). Eastern Press, Bloomington, Indiana. {{ISBN|0-939758-00-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stein, R. A. (1972) ''Tibetan Civilization'', p. 131. Stanford University Press. {{ISBN|0-8047-0806-1}} (cloth); {{ISBN|0-8047-0901-7}} (pbk)&lt;/ref&gt;

The other brother, Mutik Tsenpo, was apparently not considered for office as he had previously murdered a senior minister and had been banished to [[Lhodak Kharchu]] near the [[Bhutan]]ese border.&lt;ref&gt;Shakabpa, Tsepon W. D. ''Tibet: A Political History'' (1967), p. 47. Yale University Press, New Haven and London.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Turban Training Centre''' or '''Turban Tying Centre''' or '''Dastar Academy'''  ({{lang-pa|ਦਸਤਾਰ ਸਿਖਲਾਈ ਕੇਂਦਰ}}) ({{lang-hi|दस्तार सिखलाई केंद्र}}) ({{lang-ur|پگڑی تربیتی مرکز}}) are training-cum-tying institutes opened by professionals, who train [[Sikh]]s, in tying [[Dastar]] on their heads.&lt;ref name=a/&gt; They also tie Dastar for those people who do not know how to tie turban, charging fees. Their regular clients include industrialists, businessmen, doctors, engineers, transporters and students.&lt;ref name=a&gt;{{cite news|title=He found his calling in turban tying|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-11-17/ludhiana/30409435_1_meters-trains-professionals|accessdate=13 February 2013|newspaper=Times of India|date=17 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=b&gt;{{cite news|title=Movies revive 'pag' connection|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-02-13/ludhiana/37078533_1_turban-jatt-and-juliet-punjabi|accessdate=13 February 2013|newspaper=Times of India|date=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turban training centers have opened mostly in main cities of [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], such as [[Ludhiana]], [[Jalandhar]], [[Bathinda]], [[Patiala]], [[Amritsar]], [[Chamkaur]], [[Moga, Punjab|Moga]].&lt;ref name=a/&gt; Baptized male Sikhs cover their hair with a turban, while baptized female Sikhs may do so. However, the trend of wearing turbans declined due to fashion,glamor and youngsters preferring to keep cut hair and a clean shaved face. Regional Punjabi film stars and [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] music icons such as [[Inderjit Nikku]], [[Diljit Dosanjh]], [[Lehmber Hussainpuri]], [[Ravinder Grewal]], [[Ammy Virk]], [[Ranjit Bawa]],[[Sidhu Moose Wala]],[[Tarsem Jassar]],Kulbir Jhinjher,[[Surjit Bindrakhia]],[[Himmat Sandhu]] who always wear [[Pagri (turban)|Pag]] in their films and music videos, have inspired Sikh youths to wear turbans with various new styles.&lt;ref name=b/&gt;

Several styles of Sikh turban are popular, including Patiala Shahi, Morni Dastar, Pochvi Dastar, Barnala Shahi, Amritsar Shahi, Vatta Vaali and Dumalla/Dhamalla for baptised Sikhs. Dabbi Vaale Parne is a casual turban mostly worn by farmers in villages and has been popularized by Diljit Dosanjh,Nikku,Ravinder Grewal and now popularized in cities as well. Barring these, a simple turban with the shape and size of individual liking is tied. The length of cloth of any of the above styles varies according to personal suiting.

Some centres also provide training in ''[[Dumalla|Dumalla style]]'',  which is basic attire for all baptized Sikhs and can also teach Parna a casual turban to all category of Sikhs. Many Sabat Surat Turban Trainers/Tyers have inspired Sabat Surat Sikh Youth and other clean shaven males to wear [[Dastar]] to keep hair back and reject caps. Many turban trainers offer training camps in Non-Punjab States like Delhi, Maharashtra etc.

== Technique ==
Turban Trainers mostly prefer common full "Voil" or "F-74 Malmal" cloth and prefer double over single size and the turban is slightly made wet before they start the tying procedure and before tying [[Dastar]] a [[Patka]] or Keski is tied on head to cover hair first and head base is set in a proper way by tying the hair backwards

== Retailers ==
Some Turban Centres only sell turbans such as full Voil, Rubia or Malmal Cloth but do not give professional training and are called by name Pagri Centre. 

During the wedding season and major festivals the number of clients increase.&lt;ref name=a/&gt;
