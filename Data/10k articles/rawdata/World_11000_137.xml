'''''Adiós Carmen''''' is a 2013 film by Mohamed Amin Benamraoui, and the first in the [[Berber languages|Berber]] (Tamazight) language, though it also includes some Arabic, Spanish, and French. Set in the [[Rif]] region of northern Morocco in 1975, the film tells the story of 10-year-old Amar and his interactions with a Spanish refugee named Carmen, who introduces him to film. Adiós Carmen won the Prix du Public at the 14th Mediterranean Film Festival in Brussels in 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ÉDITION 2014 – CINEMAMED|url = http://www.cinemamed.be/historique-2/archives/edition-2014/|website = www.cinemamed.be|access-date = 2016-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the "Muhr Arab Special Mention" and the best feature in the [[Dubai International Film Festival]] 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Moroccan film Adios Carmen wins first prize Yaounde festival|url = http://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2014/07/135485/moroccan-film-adios-carmen-wins-first-prize-yaounde-festival/|website = Morocco World News|access-date = 2016-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
After Amar's widowed mother leaves him to remarry in Belgium, he searches for someone to care for him while living with his violent, drunk uncle and awaiting his mother's return. His neighbor Carmen, meanwhile, works as an usher in the village cinema and takes Amar there after becoming worried about the loneliness and bullying he faces. Amar becomes fascinated with film despite understanding little of the language and returns home singing a song from the film. Soon Amar becomes a messenger for the love letters exchanged between Carmen and a man who repairs bicycles, but one day Amar's uncle finds a letter in Amar's pocket before he has a chance to deliver it, becomes angry, and threatens him. Although Amar's house remains filled with domestic violence, he is becoming closer friends with other boys, and tries to learn how to fight. When the news of [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s death Carmen and her brother, she declares that she does not wish to return to Spain and live like their mother. Carmen's boyfriend reads her latest letter and angrily tells Amar to tell Carmen that their relationship is over and he is getting married. From then on, Carmen becomes more withdrawn and eventually decides to return to Spain. Nevertheless, Amar's life begins to improve: his abusive uncle is sentenced to two and a half years in jail, he makes a rudimentary movie projector at home, and he is reunited with his mother.

The '''Battle of Nikopol''', ''or '''Nicopolis''''' ([[Turkish language|Turkish]]: Niğbolu Muharebesi), was one of the early battles of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)]].  As the Russian army crossed the [[Danube]] River, they approached the fortified city of [[Nikopol, Bulgaria|Nikopol]] (Nicopolis).  The Turkish high command sent [[Osman Nuri Paşa|Osman Pasha]] with the troops from [[Vidin]] to oppose the Russians' crossing of the Danube.  Osman's intentions were to reinforce and defend Nikopol.  However, the Russian IX Corps under General [[Nikolai Kridener]] reached the city and bombarded the garrison into submission before Osman could arrive.  He instead fell back to [[Pleven|Plevna]].  With the Nikopol garrison eliminated, the Russians were free to march on to [[Pleven|Plevna]].

'''CKCX''' was the callsign used for the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]'s [[shortwave]] transmitter complex near [[Sackville, New Brunswick]] at the [[Tantramar Marshes]]. The [[Radio_Canada_International#Sackville_Relay_Station|Sackville Relay Station]] was operated by [[Radio Canada International]] and broadcast its programming around the world as well as relay transmissions from several foreign shortwave broadcasters. Domestically, it transmitted broadcasts on 9.625&amp;nbsp;MHz to northern Quebec by [[CBC North]], the James Bay Cree Communications Society and [[Taqramiut Nipingat]], the Inuit communications society of the [[Nunavik]] region of northern Quebec.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2001/DB2001-518.htm Decision CRTC 2001-518&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The CKCX designation was assigned after CBC Radio's [[CBAM-FM|CBA]], under whose licence the Sackville complex originally operated, moved to [[Moncton]] in 1968. Sackville was also used by [[Radio Japan]], [[China Radio International]], [[Voice of Vietnam]], [[BBC World Service]], [[Deutsche Welle]]  and [[Radio Korea]] as part of a transmitter time exchange agreement.

==History==
The site at Sackville was originally built in 1938 for CBC local broadcasting over radio station [[CBA (AM)|CBA]]. In 1943, two RCA shortwave transmitters were installed.
In 1970, all CBC operations moved to Moncton, New Brunswick &amp;mdash; this move was necessary so as to allow new Collins transmitters to be installed.
In the mid-1980s, the RCA transmitters were replaced by the three, more modern, Harris transmitters.

==Decommissioning and demolition==
Radio Canada International's shortwave service was shut down in June 2012 due to Canadian Broadcasting Corporation budget cuts as a result of reduced federal subsidies.  As a result the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation sought to sell the Sackville site to either another international broadcaster or a wind farm company. According to Martin Marcotte, director of CBC Transmission: "[The Sackville complex] will be fairly costly to dismantle and as a last resort we would dismantle the facility, return it to bare land as it was when we first acquired that site."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/story/2012/06/26/nb-rci-transmission-ends.html "RCI ends shortwave broadcast - Sackville, N.B. transmitters will be sold]", ''CBC News'', June 26, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The transmission site was officially closed on October 31, 2012, at the conclusion of several contracts leasing transmitter time to international broadcasters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sackville shortwave transmission site closes|url=http://cbcrcblog.com/people/sackville-shortwave-transmission-site-closes/?lang=en|accessdate=June 30, 2013|newspaper=CBC/Radio Canada|date=October 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site, however, continued to be used until December 1, 2012, for transmission of CBC's Northern Quebec service until the installation of several low power transmitters in the target region could be completed. The CRTC granted a request by the CBC to revoke CKCX's license effective December 1, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2012/2012-602-1.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The site was subsequently dismantled. After failing to receive any bids to purchase the complex, the antennas were dismantled and transmission towers demolished in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sackville, N.B. residents to lose landmark radio transmission towers|url=http://atlantic.ctvnews.ca/sackville-n-b-residents-to-lose-landmark-radio-transmission-towers-1.1707350|accessdate=March 2, 2014|newspaper=[[CTV News]]|date=February 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

RCI's parent, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, was the owner and operator of the Sackville transmission site, call sign CKCX. RCI's only [[transmitter]] site was located on the [[Tantramar Marshes]] several kilometres east of the town of [[Sackville, New Brunswick|Sackville]], [[New Brunswick]]. RCI leased or bartered its spare transmission capacity with other international broadcasters. Sackville was the only high power [[shortwave]] relay station in [[Canada]] and also transmitted [[CBC North]] broadcasts to northern Quebec.

==Technology==
The Sackville facility was an impressive mixture of diverse technologies. The whole facility was controlled by computer automation which was centralized in the main control room. Frequencies, antennas, and input feeds are switched all according to internationally agreed upon schedules which were renegotiated twice per year with other countries. 

Sackville transmitter power level breakdown
* There were 9 transmitters in operation in 2012.
* (3 or 4) x 100&amp;nbsp;kW
* (3 or 4) x 250&amp;nbsp;kW
* 3 x 300&amp;nbsp;kW
* The site was capable of utilizing 500&amp;nbsp;kW transmitters, but the end of the [[Cold War]] and improved [[shortwave]] frequency coordination made upgrading to 500&amp;nbsp;kW unnecessary.

The newest ASEA BROWN BOVERI (ABB) transmitters used a "pulse-step" type modulation (PSM). All Sackville ABB transmitters had 250&amp;nbsp;kW output, although there were some newer Thales transmitters that are 300&amp;nbsp;kW. Thales transmitters could use APDM (Adaptive PDM) the design successor to PSM (partly based on PSM modulation).

All modern Sackville SW transmitters incorporated [[Dynamic Carrier Control]] (DCC) of some kind.
* DCC causes the carrier level to be automatically reduced when there are lower levels or no audio.
* During periods of silence (no audio), the carrier power was reduced by 50%, so the 250&amp;nbsp;kW transmitter put out a carrier of 125&amp;nbsp;kW during audio pauses. This saved otherwise wasted empty carrier power.

==Site layout==
Sackville had a site layout similar to the [[Wertachtal]] Shortwave Relay Station, with a few substantial differences.
* Wertachtal has 3 arms of [[HRS type antennas]] that are spaced at ~120 degrees. Sackville Relay Station only approximates this configuration.
* The Wertachtal configuration allows for near 360 degree coverage of the world.
* Wertachtal exclusively contains HRS type transmission antennas, whereas Sackville does not.
* Sackville site configuration information supported this comparison, with respect to HRS type antenna azimuths.

=== Site configuration ===
This site configuration data is known to be accurate for 2004-2005.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Transmitters (configuration not fully verified)
* 3 × 250&amp;nbsp;kW SW (1993&amp;ndash;1995, ABB: SK 53 C3-2)
* 3 × 100&amp;nbsp;kW SW (1983, Harris: SW-100A) this transmitter is under démolition (3 Harris) July 2012
* 3 × (Unknown power) (Unknown models)
* A new SW transmitter has been acquired that is DRM capable.

It known that at least one SW transmitter had been outfitted to transmit [[Digital Radio Mondiale|DRM]] at this time.

Antennas (Type, Bearing) (configuration not fully verified)
* HR 4/4/1.0 (60 degrees)
* HR 4/2/1.0 (105 degrees)
* HR 4/4/1.0 (163 degrees)
* HR 4/4/1.0 (176 degrees)
* HR 4/4/1.0 (189 degrees)
* HR 2/4/1.0 (227 degrees)
* HR 2/4/1.0 (240 degrees)
* HR 4/4/1.0 (240 degrees)
* HR 4/4/1.0 (272 degrees)
* HR 2/1/0.5 (277 degrees)

'''Calestous Juma''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] [[HonFREng]]&lt;ref name="List of Fellows"&gt;{{cite web|title=List of Fellows|url=http://www.raeng.org.uk/about-us/people-council-committees/the-fellowship/list-of-fellows}}&lt;/ref&gt; (June 9, 1953 – December 15, 2017) was an internationally recognised authority in the application of science and technology to [[sustainable development]] worldwide. He was named one of the most influential 100 Africans in 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=100 Most Influential Africans (2012): Science | url=http://newafricanmagazine.com/science/ | date=26 December 2012 | access-date=30 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=100 Most Influential Africans (2013): Science &amp; Academia | url=http://newafricanmagazine.com/100-most-influential-africans-science-academia/ | date=25 November 2013 | access-date=30 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2014 by the  ''New African'' magazine. He was Professor of the Practice of International Development and Faculty Chair of the Innovation for Economic Development Executive Program at [[Harvard Kennedy School]]. Juma was Director of the School's Science, Technology and Globalization Project at [[Harvard Kennedy School]] as well as the Agricultural Innovation in Africa Project funded by the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]]. His latest book, ''The New Harvest: Agricultural Innovation in Africa'' was published by [[Oxford University Press]] in 2011.&lt;ref name=harvest&gt;{{cite book|last=Juma|first=Calestous|title=The New Harvest: Agricultural Innovation in Africa|date=January 2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0199783199|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6l5HziiKlmgC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=harvesthks&gt;{{cite web|title=The New Harvest: Agricultural Innovation in Africa|url=http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/20504/new_harvest.html|publisher=Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs|accessdate=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recognition of his work, Juma had been elected to the [[Royal Society of London]], the US [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]], [[The World Academy of Sciences|Third]] [[The World Academy of Sciences|World Academy of Sciences]] (TWAS), the UK [[Royal Academy of Engineering]], the [[African Academy of Sciences]] and the [[New York Academy of Sciences]].

==Early life and education==
Juma grew up on the Kenyan shores of [[Lake Victoria]] where he obtained early education as one of the pioneer students of the then Port Victoria Secondary School (now John Osogo SS) from 1968-1971. He first worked as an elementary school teacher before becoming Africa's first science and environment journalist at Kenya's [[Daily Nation]] newspaper.  Juma later joined the Nairobi-based Environment Liaison Centre International as a founder and editor of trilingual quarterly magazine, ''Ecoforum''. He later received an MSc in Science, Technology and Industrialization and a DPhil in Science and Technology Policy from the [[Science Policy Research Unit]] at the [[University of Sussex]].  He has written widely on science, technology and sustainable development.

==Leadership==
In 1988, Professor Juma founded the [[African Centre for Technology Studies]], Africa's first independent policy research institution designed to advance research on technology in development.&lt;ref name="Juma_Harvard_2012"&gt;{{citation |url=https://apps.hks.harvard.edu/faculty/cv/calestousjuma.pdf |format=PDF |date=November 2012|title=Calestous Juma |pages=27 |accessdate=January 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}}  In 1989 ACTS released a groundbreaking study called "Innovation and Sovereignty" that led to the adoption of the Industrial Property Act in Kenya and the creation of the Kenya Industrial Property Office.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Policy research==
His continuing original work focuses on analysing the dynamics of evolutionary technological change and applying the results in advancing science and technology policy research; providing high-level science and technology advice; and promoting [[biodiversity]] conservation.

===Technological innovation===
Juma has made significant contributions to understanding the dynamic role of technological innovation in economic transformation in developing countries. He developed the concept of "evolutionary technological change" to explain how socio-economic environments shape the adoption and diffusion of new technologies. This approach was elaborated in his early works such as ''Long-Run Economics: An Evolutionary Approach to Economic Growth'' ([[Frances Pinter|Pinter]], 1987) and ''The Gene Hunters: Biotechnology and the Scramble for Seeds'' ([[Princeton University Press]] and Zed Books, 1989) and remains central to theoretical and practical work. Juma's contributions to science and technology policy have focused on the role of technological innovation in [[sustainable development]].

===Biotechnology===
He has established himself as a world leader in policy research on [[biotechnology]] and directed the International Diffusion of Biotechnology Programme of the International Federation of Institutes of Advanced Studies. He continues to provide international leadership in research, training and outreach through Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government. He is also advancing scholarship in this field as editor of the [[Peer review|peer-review]]ed ''International Journal of Technology and Globalisation''.

===Biological diversity===
Juma has contributed to biodiversity conservation in two ways. First, he has helped to shape global conservation programmes during his tenure as the first permanent Executive Secretary of the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] in Geneva and Montreal. Second, his research has inspired the field of [[biodiplomacy]] that focuses on interactions between [[biosciences]] and international relations.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

===Property rights===
Juma's research has helped to improve understanding on the role of [[property rights]] in conservation under the rubric of "ecological jurisprudence" as outlined in the volume, ''In Land We Trust'' (Zed, 1996). His work guided international negotiations on the United Nations [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD) as documented in ''Biodiplomacy'' (ACTS, 1994). He later became Executive Secretary of the CBD where he advanced the use of scientific knowledge in conservation policy and practice.

==Teaching==
Juma teaches graduate courses on the role of science, technology, and innovation in development policy. The first course focuses on the role of technological innovation in economic growth with emphasis on emerging regions of the world. The second course examines the policy implications of the introduction of new biotechnology products in the global economy (covering health, agriculture, industry and environment). He also teaches an executive course for senior policy makers and practitioners. The Innovation executive program runs annually to provide high-level leaders from government, academia, industry, and civil society with an opportunity to learn how to integrate science and technology into a national development policy.

==Policy advice==
Juma continues to provide high-level policy advice to governments, the United Nations and other international organisations on science, technology, and innovation. He chairs the Global Challenges and Biotechnology of the [[National Academy of Sciences|US National Academy of Sciences]] and serves as co-chair of the African High-Level Panel on Modern Biotechnology [http://www.nepadst.org/biopanel/index.shtml] of the [[African Union]] (AU) and the [[New Partnership for Africa's Development]] (NEPAD).

Juma led international experts in outlining ways to apply science and technology to the implementation of the [[Millennium Development Goals]] arising from the 2000 UN Millennium Summit. ''Innovation: Applying Knowledge in Development'' (Earthscan, 2005), the report of the Task Force on Science, Technology and Innovation of the [[UN Millennium Project]], was released in early 2005 and its recommendations have been adopted by [[List of development aid agencies|development agencies]] and governments around the world. The report has become a standard reference against which governments assess their policies and programmes on the role of technological innovation in development.

In a successor study called ''Going for Growth'', Professor Juma proposes that international development policy should be directed at building technical competence in developing countries rather than conventional relief activities. He argues that institutions of higher learning, especially universities, should be have a direct role in helping to solve development challenges.

In 2012 Juma was appointed by the African Union to chair its High-Level Panel on Science, Technology and Innovation. The report of the panel will be submitted to the AU in early 2014.

==Controversy==
In August 2013 [[Monsanto]] approached Juma with a proposal to write a series of seven papers  in support of [[genetically modified organisms]], according to e-mails obtained through a public records request, per the Boston Globe. Monsanto suggested a headline "Consequences of Rejecting GM crops". In December 2014, Juma published "Global Risks of Rejecting Agricultural Biotechnology" on a website called  "Genetic Literacy Project, Science trumps ideology"&lt;ref&gt;Calestous Juma [http://www.geneticliteracyproject.org/2014/12/09/global-risks-of-rejecting-agricultural-biotechnology/ Global Risks of Rejecting Agricultural Biotechnology] December 9, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; with the help of a Monsanto marketing firm and failed to disclose his communication with them.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Krantz [https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/10/01/harvard-professor-failed-disclose-monsanto-connection-paper-touting-gmos/lLJipJQ mI5WKS6RAgQbnrN/story.html Harvard professor failed to disclose Monsanto connection in paper touting GMOs.]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Boston Globe, 1 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charlie''' (born as Károly Horváth in [[Ónod]], [[Hungary]] 28 October 1947) is a Hungarian rock and soul singer.  In 1978, he married Katalin, with whom he has a son called Ákos.

From the mid-1960s, he sang in Hungarian rock bands such as Decca and Olympia.  He later joined rock band Generál.  In 1989, he formed a soul act titled "Tátrai Band" with guitarist Tibor Tátrai.  Other members of the band included Géza Pálvölgyi, Kovács Tamás, Tátrai Tibor and Zsoldos Tamás &lt;ref&gt;http://www.discogs.com/artist/T%C3%A1trai+Band&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Charlie went solo and has released solo albums under his stage name of "Charlie", and most of them charted in the Hungarian charts. He was chosen to represent Hungary in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1998]] in [[Birmingham]], where he performed his song titled "[[A holnap már nem lesz szomorú]]" (Sadness Will Be Over Tomorrow).  He finished 23rd out of 25 with just four points&lt;ref&gt;http://www.diggiloo.net/?1998hu&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Corpo Nacional de Escutas da Guiné-Bissau''' (CNE-GB; roughly ''National Scout Corps of Guinea-Bissau'') is the national [[Catholic]] [[Scouting]] organization of [[Guinea-Bissau]]. Guinea-Bissau is one of 29 countries where Scouting exists but there is no National Scout Organization which is a member of the [[World Organization of the Scout Movement]] at the present time.&lt;ref name="scouting elsewhere"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scout.org/en/around_the_world/countries/scouting_elsewhere |title=Scouting Elsewhere |publisher=[[World Organization of the Scout Movement]] |accessdate=2007-03-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312052328/http://www.scout.org/en/around_the_world/countries/scouting_elsewhere |archivedate=2007-03-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The co-educational association serves about 1,500 members.&lt;ref name="CNE-GB membership"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://escutismoguineense.blogspot.com/ |title=Corpo Nacional de Escutas da Guiné-Bissau |publisher=Corpo Nacional de Escutas da Guiné-Bissau |accessdate=2007-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a member of the [[Comunidade do Escutismo Lusófono]] (''Community of [[Lusophone]] Scouting''). The national campsite is situated at [[Quinhámel]].&lt;ref name="campsite"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/details?mid=65f34653e1aaf769ef5b7619c36c6c12 |title=Campo Escola de Quinhámel/Scout Camp of Quinhámel |publisher= |accessdate=2007-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Associação de Escoteiros de Guiné Portuguesa.svg|140px|left|thumb|pre-independence Associação de Escoteiros de Guiné Portuguesa]]

The CNE-GB was founded on November 25, 1966;&lt;ref name="CNE-GB membership"/&gt; after 1974 it was replaced by the [[African Youth Amílcar Cabral|Juventude Africano Amílcar Cabral]]. Scouting was one of several youth organizations made legal for free association by the [[Politics of Guinea-Bissau|constitution of 1991]].&lt;ref name="Guinea-Bissau YO"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Africa/Guinea-Bissau-ORGANIZATIONS.html |title=Guinea-Bissau - Organizations |publisher=Encyclopedia of the Nations |accessdate=2007-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After fifteen months of preparation by a group of ten men and five women, seven of which were Scouts during the colonial period, and with an intensive orientation course by six Commissioners of the [[Corpo Nacional de Escutas de Portugal]] which took place in the parochial center between February 23 and February 27, 1993, the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Bissau|Bissau cathedral]] was the place of renovation of the CNE-GB for the first time after 27 years.

Throughout Russian history famines and droughts have been a common feature, often resulting in humanitarian crises traceable to political or economic instability, poor policy, environmental issues and war. Droughts and famines in [[Russia]] and the [[Soviet Union]] tended to occur fairly regularly, with [[famine]] occurring every 10–13 years and [[drought]]s every five to seven years.  Golubev and Dronin distinguish three types of drought according to productive areas vulnerable to droughts: Central (the [[Volga River|Volga]] [[Drainage basin|basin]], [[North Caucasus]] and the [[Central Black Earth Region|Central Chernozem Region]]), Southern (Volga and Volga-[[Kirov Oblast|Vyatka]] area, the [[Ural (region)|Ural]] region, and [[Ukraine]]), and Eastern ([[steppe]] and forest-steppe belts in Western and Eastern [[Siberia]], and [[Kazakhstan]]).&lt;ref name=rep2004&gt;{{cite web|first1=Genady|last=Golubev|author2=Nikolai Dronin|format=PDF|url=http://www2.cesr.de/component/easyfolderlistingpro/?view=download&amp;format=raw&amp;data=eNpFT20OwiAMvUsv4KbJ1HoYgqPbMIwSytwS492FfcRf0Nf3VY11jR_BBqFjZyjCQ_CGYHj2jrUpY2bAJBQ3gqwQQnWs-okk_cVXBKVWbLcqUq9HKmOFUJ5mQ222t1htokgu6DSU9R3hFFwiv6hNspt01tFhcs5sE3nqhyRKe6M6ZqOsV3ESsbpQLgi0pP0XTLcXoyXYSHKk1rmOTkm3w0g-s58rmtNDpLeleTsol-2Ze5ezvz-OIGHM|title=Geography of Droughts and Food Problems in Russia (1900–2000), Report No. A 0401|publisher=Center for Environmental Systems Research, University of Kassel|date=February 2004|accessdate=December 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-1900 droughts and famines==
In the 17th century, Russia experienced the [[Russian famine of 1601–03|famine of 1601–1603]], believed to be its worst as it may have killed 2 million people (1/3 of the population). Major famines include the [[Great Famine of 1315–17]], which affected much of Europe including part of Russia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Frank E.|last=Smitha|url=http://www.fsmitha.com/h3/h20russ.htm|title=Russia to 1700|publisher=fsmitha.com|accessdate=December 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, Henry S.

Causes included a large Autumn drought resulting in crop failures. Attempts by the government to alleviate the situation generally failed which may have contributed to a lack of faith in the Czarist regime and later political instability.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iupui.edu/~histwhs/h699.dir/HumanitChrono.htm|title=The History of International Humanitarian Assistance: Notes on Developments in 19th and 20th centuries|publisher=Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI)|accessdate=December 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Golubev and Dronin report gives the following table of the major droughts in Russia between 1900 and 2000.&lt;ref name=rep2004/&gt; 
*Central: 1920, 1924, 1936, 1946, 1972, 1979, 1981, 1984.
*Southern: 1901, 1906, 1921, 1939, 1948, 1951, 1957, 1975, 1995.
*Eastern: 1911, 1931, 1963, 1965, 1991.

== 1900s ==
The failed [[1905 Russian Revolution|Revolution of 1905]] likely distorted output and restricted food availability.

== 1910s ==
During the [[Russian Revolution]] and following [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] there was a decline in total agricultural output. Measured in millions of tons the 1920 grain harvest was only 46.1, compared to 80.1 in 1913. By 1926 it had almost returned to pre-war levels reaching 76.8.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Economic History of the USSR 1917–1991|last=Nove|first=Alec|publisher=Penguin Books|year=1992|isbn=|location=|pages=88–89|quote=Nove notes that the harvest in 1913 was during an "extremely favorable year" indicating a somewhat larger than expected crop.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1920s==
The early 1920s saw a series of famines. The [[Russian famine of 1921|first famine in the USSR]] happened in 1921–1923 and garnered wide international attention. The most affected area being the Southeastern areas of [[European Russia]]  (including [[Volga region]], especially national republics of [[Idel-Ural]], see [[1921–22 famine in Tatarstan]]) and Ukraine. An estimated 16 million people may have been affected and up to 5 million died.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/video/1853678422/|title=WGBH American Experience .

When the [[Russian famine of 1921]] broke out, the [[American Relief Administration]]'s director in Europe, [[Walter Lyman Brown]],  began negotiating with Soviet deputy [[People's Commissar]] for Foreign Affairs, [[Maxim Litvinov]], in [[Riga]], [[Latvia]]. An agreement was reached on August 21, 1921, and an additional implementation agreement was signed by Brown and People's Commisar for Foreign Trade [[Leonid Krasin]] on December 30, 1921. The U.S. Congress appropriated $20,000,000 for relief under the [[Russian Famine Relief Act]] of late 1921.

At its peak, the ARA employed 300 Americans, more than 120,000 Russians and fed 10.5 million people daily. Its Russian operations were headed by Col. [[William N. Haskell]]. The Medical Division of the ARA functioned from November 1921 to June 1923 and helped overcome the [[typhus]] epidemic then ravaging Russia.

=== [[Soviet famine of 1932–33|Soviet Famine of 1932–1933]] ===

The second major Soviet famine happened during the initial [[collectivization in the Soviet Union|push for collectivization]] during the 30s. Major [[Causes of the Holodomor|causes]] include the 1932–33 confiscations of [[grain]] and other food by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] authorities{{ref|CongressCommission}} which contributed to the famine and affected more than forty million people, especially in the south on the [[Don River (Russia)|Don]] and [[Kuban]] areas and in [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukraine]], whereby various estimates&amp;nbsp;millions starved to death or died due to famine related illness (the event known as ''[[Holodomor]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Helen|last=Fawkes|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6179818.stm|title=Legacy of famine divides Ukraine|newspaper=BBC News|location=Kiev|date=November 24, 2006|accessdate=December 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The famine was perhaps most severe in Kazakstan where the semi-nomadic pastoralists' traditional way of life was most disturbed by Soviet agricultural ambitions.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Gráda, C. Ó. (2010). ''Famine: a short history''. Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is still debate over whether or not Holodomor was a massive failure of policy or a deliberate act of genocide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://reviewcanada.ca/magazine/2009/12/genocide-or-a-vast-tragedy/|title=Genocide or "A Vast Tragedy"? {{!}} Literary Review of Canada|newspaper=Literary Review of Canada|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Conquest]] held the view that the famine was not intentionally inflicted by Stalin, but "with resulting famine imminent, he could have prevented it, but put “Soviet interest” other than feeding the starving first—thus consciously abetting it".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Years Of Hunger.|last=Davies, R.

''Slavic Review'' 50.1 (1991): 70–89.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the argument that the famine was significantly worsened by the actions of the [[kulaks]], a class of peasants who had become wealthy after the [[Stolypin reform]], many of whom burned their crops and killed their livestock rather than give their lands and livestock over to collectivization.&lt;ref&gt;Tottle, Douglas "Fraud, Famine and Fascism: The Ukrainian Genocide Myth from Hitler to Harvard."

=== [[Holodomor#Death toll|Demographic Impact]] ===

{{Quote box
| quote = "One demographic retrojection suggests a figure of 2.5 million famine deaths for Soviet Ukraine and Kuban region. This is too close to the recorded figure of excess deaths, which is about 2.4 million. The latter figure must be substantially low, since many deaths were not recorded. Another demographic calculation, carried out on behalf of the authorities of independent Ukraine, provides the figure of 3.9 million dead. The truth is probably in between these numbers, where most of the estimates of respectable scholars can be found. It seems reasonable to propose a figure of approximately 3.3 million deaths by starvation and hunger-related disease in Soviet Ukraine in 1932–1933".

}}The demographic impact of the famine of 1932–1933 was multifold. In addition to direct and indirect deaths associated with the famine, there were significant internal migrations of Soviet citizens, often fleeing famine-ridden regions. A sudden decline in birthrates permanently "scarred" the long-term population growth of the Soviet Union in a way similar to, although not as severe, as that of World War 2.

Estimates of Soviet deaths attributable to the 1932–1933 famine vary wildly, but are typically given in the range of millions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Ukraine/The-famine-of-1932-33|title=Ukraine – The famine of 1932–33 {{!}} history – geography|newspaper=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/modern-world-history-1918-to-1980/russia-1900-to-1939/the-great-famine/|title=The Great Famine – History Learning Site|newspaper=History Learning Site|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyplace.com/worldhistory/genocide/stalin.htm|title=The History Place – Genocide in the 20th Century: Stalin's Forced Famine 1932–33|website=www.historyplace.com|access-date=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vallin et al. estimated that the disasters of the decade culminated in a dramatic fall in fertility and a rise in mortality. Their estimates suggest that total losses can be put at about 4.6 million, 0.9 million of which was due to forced migration, 1 million to a deficit in births, and 2.6 million to exceptional mortality.&lt;ref&gt;Vallin, Jacques; Meslé, France; Adamets, Serguei; Pyrozhkov, Serhii (2002).

Figure 6.5 simulates the population without the excess mortality of the war and, in addition, without the reduction in fertility during and after the war. Eliminating the wartime mortality raises the 1989 population to 329 million, and eliminating the shortfall in fertility raises it by a further 34 million to 363 million. The fertility effect (34 million) was almost as large as the mortality effect (41 million). World War II cut the Soviet population by 21 percent. Figure 6.7 shows the results of a combined simulation in which the adverse fertility and mortality effects of the war and collectivization are removed from Soviet demographic history. The simulation shows how the population would have grown if it were subject to the "normal fertility" and mortality rates. The 1989 population under this simulation would have been 394 million instead of the 288 million actually alive. The impact of collectivization and the Second World War was to reduce the 1989 population of the Soviet Union by 27%.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to the deaths, the famine resulted in massive population movements, as about 300,000 [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]] [[nomad]]s fled to [[Republic of China (1912–49)|China]], [[Pahlavi dynasty|Iran]], [[Mongolian People's Republic|Mongolia]] and [[Kingdom of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]] during the famine.&lt;ref&gt;Kokaisl, Petr.

=== [[Holodomor in modern politics|Legacy]] ===

The legacy of Holodomor remains a sensitive and controversial issue in contemporary Ukraine where it is [[Holodomor genocide question|regarded as an act of genocide]] by the government and is generally remembered as one of the greatest tragedies in the nation's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kappeler|first=Andreas|date=2014|title=Ukraine and Russia: Legacies of the imperial past and competing memories|url=|journal=Journal of Eurasian Studies|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Motyl|first=Alexander|date=2010|title=Deleting the Holodomor: Ukraine unmakes itself|url=|journal=World Affairs|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kupfer, Matthew, and Thomas de Waal.

==1940s==
During [[Siege of Leningrad|The Siege of Leningrad]] by Nazi Germany, as many as one million people died while many more went hungry or starved but survived. Germans tried to starve out Leningrad in order to break its resistance. Starvation was one of the primary causes of death as the food supply was cut off and strict rationing was enforced. Animals in the city were slaughtered and eaten. Instances of [[cannibalism]] were reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/leningrad.htm|title=The Siege of Leningrad, 1941 – 1944|last=|first=|date=2006|website=www.eyewitnesstohistory.com|dead-url=|access-date=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.saint-petersburg.com/history/great-patriotic-war-and-siege-of-leningrad/|title=History of St. Petersburg during World War II|website=www.saint-petersburg.com|access-date=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Soviet famine of 1946–47|last major famine]] in the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] happened mainly in 1947 as a cumulative effect of consequences of collectivization, war damage, the severe [[drought]] in 1946 in over 50 percent of the grain-productive zone of the country and government social policy and mismanagement of grain reserves.

{{Time zones of Africa}}
'''East Africa Time''', or '''EAT''', is a [[time zone]] used in eastern [[Africa]]. The zone is three hours ahead of UTC ([[UTC+3]]), which is the same as [[Arabia Standard Time]], [[Further-eastern European Time]], [[Moscow Time]] and [[Eastern European Summer Time]].&lt;ref name="world-time-zones"&gt;{{cite web|title=EAT Time|url=http://www.world-time-zones.org/zones/east-africa-time.htm|publisher=World Time Zones.Org|accessdate=29 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As this Time Zone is predominantly in the [[equator]]ial region, there is no significant change in day length throughout the year and so [[daylight saving time]] is not observed.&lt;ref name="world-time-zones" /&gt;

East Africa Time is used by the following countries:
* {{Flagcountry|Comoros}}
* {{Flagcountry|Djibouti}}
* {{Flagcountry|Eritrea}}
* {{Flagcountry|Ethiopia}}
* {{Flagcountry|Kenya}}
* {{Flagcountry|Madagascar}}

== History ==
elplural.com was born as a project by the Catalan journalist Enric Sopena,&lt;ref name="birth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EsD2017"/&gt; whose previous experience came from audiovisual or written media such as ''[[La Vanguardia]]'' and [[Televisión Española|TVE]]. Despite its geographical origin in Catalonia, ''El Plural'' deals with national and international topics, and over time a fixed section has focused on [[Andalusia]], together with other regional sections. From 2010, Enric Sopena became a shareholder of the newspaper's publishing company. Until then the ownership of this medium was in the hands of a company linked to Lavinia TV.&lt;ref name="PD2009"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170420143559/http://www.vanitatis.elconfidencial.com/television/2010-09-03/enric-sopena-se-compra-elplural-com_492619/ |url=http://www.vanitatis.elconfidencial.com/television/2010-09-03/enric-sopena-se-compra-elplural-com_492619/ |title=Enric Sopena se compra elplural.com |language=spanish |trans-title=Enric Sopena buys ElPlural.com |first=Eduardo |last=Verbo |website=[[El Confidencial]] |date=3 September 2010 |accessdate=3 September 2018 |archivedate=20 April 2017 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 22, 2017, the General Shareholders' Meeting of elplural.com accepted the retirement request of Enric Sopena as director of the newspaper, becoming 'President 'Emeritus', writing an opinion column titled 'Cabos Sueltos'.&lt;ref name="2d460bab"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Moreno |first=Marisu |title=Angélica Rubio sustituye a Enric Sopena en la dirección de ELPLURAL.COM |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180903164853/https://www.elplural.com/comunicacion/angelica-rubio-sustituye-a-enric-sopena-en-la-direccion-de-elplural-com_101159102 |date=22 March 2017 |url=http://www.elplural.com/comunicacion/2017/03/22/angelica-rubio-sustituye-enric-sopena-en-la-direccion-de-elpluralcom |archivedate=3 September 2018 |website=El Plural |language=spanish |trans-title=Angélica Rubio replaces Enric Sopena as manager of elplural.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The newspaper has sections on Politics, Economic, Communications and Society. In addition, elplural.com has a [[Autonomous communities of Spain|Autonomous communities]]' section, focused on [[Catalonia]], the [[Balearic Islands]] and [[Andalusia]]. The latter, since September 26, 2016, is formed by the integration of the ''Andaluces Diario'' newspaper,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |trans-title=ELPLURAL.COM reinforces its territorial expansion with the 'signing' of Andalucesdiario.es |url=http://www.elplural.com/2016/09/23/elpluralcom-refuerza-su-expansion-territorial-con-el-fichaje-de-andalucesdiarioes |deadurl=no |title=ELPLURAL.COM refuerza su expansión territorial con el ‘fichaje’ de Andalucesdiario.es |accessdate=4 September 2018 |surname=Gil |date=23 September 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180904072907/https://www.elplural.com/autonomias/andalucia/elplural-com-refuerza-su-expansion-territorial-con-el-fichaje-de-andalucesdiario-es_91240102 |language=spanish |website=El Plural |first=Sara |archivedate=4 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; led by the journalist Antonio Avendaño, who joined from ''[[Público (Spain)|Público]]''.

The Opinion section is composed of conventional articles and analysis, as well as cartoons from the series "Los Calvitos", by humorist Patricio Rocco, aka Pat.

Apart from the usual sections, the newspaper includes various magazines, such as ''El Telescopio'' - dedicated to Technology and Innovation -, ''La Pimienta de la Vida'' - focused on gastronomy and lifestyle - ''Motor'' - automotive sector associated with the Autofácil publication - and ''Playtime'' - leisure and culture.

== Editorial line ==
''El Plural'' defines itself as a progressive daily.&lt;ref name="EsD2017"/&gt; It has had connections with [[Socialists' Party of Catalonia|PSC-PSOE]].&lt;ref name="PD2009"&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091118195120/http://www.periodistadigital.com:80/periodismo/internet/2009/11/16/elplura-sopena-lavinia-psoe.shtml |date=16 November 2009 |first=Higinio |url=http://www.periodistadigital.com/periodismo/internet/2009/11/16/elplura-sopena-lavinia-psoe.shtml |trans-title=Enric Sopena's El Plural is owned by the Lavinia Group |last=Mosteiro |deadurl=no |website=PeriodistaDigital.com |title=El Plural de Enric Sopena es propiedad del Grupo Lavinia |language=spanish |archivedate=18 November 2009 |accessdate=4 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is aligned social-democratically.

'''Europe for Citizens''' (formerly '''Citizens for Europe''') is a [[European Union]] programme designed to help bridge the gap between citizens and the European Union. Ending in 2006, the [[European Commission]] on 6 April 2005 adopted a proposal for a programme to run from 2007 to 2013. In 2014 another [http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/europe-for-citizens_en programme] started that will continue until 2017. The programme will provide the Union with instruments to promote active European citizenship, put citizens in the centre and offers them the opportunity to fully assume their responsibility as European citizens. The Commission has determined that citizens should also be aware of their duties as citizen and become actively involved in the process of [[European integration]], developing a sense of belonging and a European identity.

The global aim of the proposed programme is to contribute to:
*Giving citizens the opportunity to interact and participate in constructing an ever-closer Europe, united in and enriched through its cultural diversity;
*Forging a European identity, based on recognised common values, history and culture;
*Enhancing mutual understanding between European citizens respecting and celebrating cultural diversity, while contributing to intercultural dialogue.

The proposal affirms that Union citizenship should be the fundamental status of nationals of the Member States.

The budget for the new program is €235 million.

[[File:Garda ERU maritime operations.jpg|thumbnail|right|Garda Water Unit conducting counter-terrorism maritime operations with the [[Garda Emergency Response Unit|ERU]] on the [[River Liffey]], [[Dublin]]]]
The '''Garda Water Unit''' ({{lang-ga|Aonad Uisce an Gharda Síochána}}) is a unit of the [[Garda Síochána]], the police service of [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. Formerly known as the '''Garda Sub-Aqua Unit''', the name was changed to incorporate the services of the non-diving surfaced based marine section.

It is part of the Operational Support Units which provides specialist support to Gardaí nationwide. The Operational Support Units also includes the [[Garda Dog Unit|Dog Support]], [[Garda Mounted Unit|Mounted Support]] and [[Garda Air Support Unit|Air Support]] .

==Operations==
The Water Unit exists to assist the Garda Síochána in both [[Underwater diving|diving]] and surface operations. Diving operations include searching for and recovery of missing persons and evidence, conducting security searches in water and in confined spaces e.g. sewers. The unit also conduct surface patrols which encompass maritime safety, maritime legislation enforcement and security patrols.

The approximate strength of the unit is three sergeants and fourteen officers,{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} who cover the entire jurisdiction of the Republic of Ireland. The unit operate out of [[Santry]] Garda Station, [[Dublin]], and [[Athlone]] Garda Station, [[Westmeath]].

==Training==
The environments where the Garda Water Unit members carry out their duties are potentially life-threatening. Training of team members is thorough and on-going. Members must successfully complete courses in the following areas:
*Breathing Apparatus and Escape sets (Confined Space Searches)
*ISA Advanced Powerboat [[Coxswain]]
*Firearms familiarisation &amp; safe handling
*Evidence handling &amp; recovery
*Garda Driving courses

Members can further specialise in: dive supervision, underwater photography, climbing &amp; rope skills, equipment servicing, and [[Sonar]] operating.

==Equipment==
[[image:Garda Patrol Boat on the Liffey.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Garda Patrol Boat ''Colm na Cora'' on the Liffey]]
The Garda Water Unit employ a mixture of fifteen different types of water-borne vessels, mostly inflatable boats. Two however are river-going vessels used for inland patrols.

{{Active An Garda Síochána vessels}}

==Inter-agency operations==
The Garda Water Unit cross-trains with the other Garda Operational Support Units. It also carries out operations and exercises with a number of agencies such as the Irish Coastguard, the [[Irish Customs Service]], the [[Irish Naval Service]] ([[Naval Service Diving Section|NSDS]]), the Fire Brigade and the Civil Defence. 
This type of multi-agency training improves operational skills and provides an opportunity to improve response times and capabilities.

'''HBG''' was a [[low frequency]] [[time signal]] [[transmitter]] for the Swiss time reference system. It transmitted on 75&amp;nbsp;kHz with 20&amp;nbsp;kW power, and was located in [[Prangins]], Switzerland.

Due to the cost of urgently needed renovation for the ageing antennas, and the ease with which all existing users could switch to the [[DCF77]] time signal, the Swiss Federal Government decided to shut down HBG at the end of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} [http://www.metas.ch/root_legnet/Web/Fachbereiche/Zeit_Frequenz/Dokumente/Pressemitteilung_HBG_Kopf_d.pdf Press release concerning the cessation of the time dissemination transmitter HBG at Prangins on 31 December 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://translate.google.com/translate?u=http://www.metas.ch/root_legnet/Web/Fachbereiche/Zeit_Frequenz/Dokumente/Pressemitteilung_HBG_Kopf_d.pdf&amp;sl=de&amp;tl=en {{en icon}} Translation]&lt;/ref&gt;
HBG transmission ceased at 2012-01-01 07:00:13.2 UTC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mailing list |url=http://www.febo.com/pipermail/time-nuts/2012-January/061892.html |title=HBG keeps transmitting... |author=Pieter-Tjerk de Boer |mailinglist=time-nuts |date=2012-01-01 |quote=I did manage to make a recording of HBG's shutdown this morning.  It was at 07:00:13.2 UTC.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 September 2012 at 12:02:00 UTC both antenna towers were demolished by controlled explosives.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}}[http://www.20min.ch/ro/news/vaud/story/La-fin-des-antennes-de-Prangins-en-live-11079213 "La fin des antennes de Prangins en live" - 20min.ch]&lt;/ref&gt;

The HBG transmission format was very similar to DCF77. At the beginning of each second (with the exception of the 59th), the [[Carrier wave|carrier]] signal was interrupted for a period of 0.1 s or 0.2 s, which corresponded to a binary "0" or "1". The transmission of the minute, hour, calendar date, day of the week, month and current year was achieved by means of a [[BCD code]] identical to that of DCF77.

Like DCF77, the carrier was not interrupted during the last second of each minute.

Differences from the DCF77 time code:
* The [[carrier frequency]].
* [[DCF77#Phase modulation|Phase modulation]] was not included.
* [[DCF77#Amplitude modulation|Amplitude modulation]] was done by disabling the transmitter (0% amplitude) rather than reducing it to 15% amplitude as DCF77 does.
* Announcement bits warning of impending time zone changes or leap seconds were sent 12 hours in advance, rather than 1 hour.
* The first pulse of each minute was not a standard 0 bit as DCF77 sends.  Instead, it was a double pulse, two 0.1 s interruptions separated by 0.1 s of carrier.  A triple pulse signalled the start of a new hour, and a four-pulse signal was transmitted at noon and midnight.

It is understood that this frequency is now available in Europe, as well as any other part of the world, for time signal dissemination.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="117504">{{Taxation}}
'''International taxation''' is the study or determination of [[tax]] on a person or business subject to the [[tax law]]s of different countries or the [[international]] aspects of an individual country's tax laws as the case may be. Governments usually limit the scope of their [[income taxation]] in some manner [[Territory (administrative division)|territorially]] or provide for offsets to taxation relating to [[Extraterritorial jurisdiction|extraterritorial]] income. The manner of limitation generally takes the form of a territorial, residence-based, or exclusionary system.  Some governments have attempted to mitigate the differing limitations of each of these three broad systems by enacting a hybrid system with characteristics of two or more.

Many governments tax individuals and/or enterprises on income. Such systems of taxation vary widely, and there are no broad general rules.  These variations create the potential for [[double taxation]] (where the same income is taxed by different countries) and no taxation (where income is not taxed by any country). Income tax systems may impose tax on local income only or on worldwide income. Generally, where worldwide income is taxed, [[Tax shield|reductions of tax]] or [[foreign tax credit|foreign credits]] are provided for taxes paid to other [[jurisdiction]]s. Limits are almost universally imposed on such credits.  [[Multinational corporation]]s usually employ international tax specialists, a specialty among both lawyers and accountants, to decrease their worldwide tax liabilities.

With any system of taxation, it is possible to shift or recharacterize income in a manner that [[tax avoidance|reduces taxation]]. Jurisdictions often impose rules relating to shifting income among commonly controlled parties, often referred to as [[transfer pricing]] rules. Residency-based systems are subject to taxpayer attempts to defer [[Revenue recognition|recognition of income]] through use of related parties. A few jurisdictions impose rules limiting such [[deferral]] ("anti-deferral" regimes). Deferral is also specifically authorized by some governments for particular social purposes or other grounds.  Agreements among governments ([[treaties]]) often attempt to determine who should be entitled to tax what. Most tax treaties provide for at least a skeleton mechanism for resolution of disputes between the parties.

==Introduction==
Systems of taxation vary among governments, making generalization difficult. Specifics are intended as examples, and relate to particular governments and not broadly recognized multinational rules. Taxes may be levied on varying measures of income, including but not limited to [[net income]] under local [[accounting]] concepts (in many countries this is referred to as '[[Profit (accounting)|profit]]'), [[Gross receipts tax|gross receipts]], [[gross margin]]s (sales less costs of sale), or specific categories of receipts less specific categories of [[Tax shield|reductions]]. Unless otherwise specified, the term "income" should be read broadly.

Jurisdictions often impose different income based levies on enterprises than on individuals. Entities are often taxed in a unified manner on all types of income while individuals are taxed in differing manners depending on the nature or source of the income. Many jurisdictions impose tax at both an entity level and at the owner level on one or more types of enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', the U.S. taxes corporations on their income and their shareholders on dividends distributed from the corporation. See U.S. IRC sections 11, 1, and 61.&lt;/ref&gt; These jurisdictions often rely on the company law of that jurisdiction or other jurisdictions in determining whether an entity's owners are to be taxed directly on the entity income. However, there are notable exceptions, including U.S. rules characterizing entities independently of legal form.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Internal Revenue Service (U.S. IRS) Reg. (hereafter 26 CFR) [http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_08/26cfr301_08.html §§301.7701-2 and -3].&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to simplify administration or for other agendas, some governments have imposed "deemed" income regimes. These regimes tax some class of taxpayers according to tax system applicable to other taxpayers but based on a deemed level of income, as if earned by the taxpayer.  Disputes can arise regarding what levy is proper. Procedures for dispute resolution vary widely and enforcement issues are far more complicated in the international arena. The ultimate dispute resolution for a taxpayer is to leave the jurisdiction, taking all property that could be seized. For governments, the ultimate resolution may be [[Search and seizure|confiscation of property]], [[incarceration]] or dissolution of the entity.

Other major conceptual differences can exist between tax systems. These include, but are not limited to, assessment vs. self-assessment means of determining and collecting tax; methods of imposing sanctions for violation; sanctions unique to international aspects of the system; mechanisms for enforcement and collection of tax; and reporting mechanisms.

==Taxation systems==
[[File:Individual taxation systems.png|right|thumb|300px|Systems of taxation on personal income{{legend|#00FF00|No income tax on individuals}}{{legend|#0080FF|Territorial}}{{legend|#000080|Residence-based}}{{legend|#FF00FF|Citizenship-based}}]]

Countries that tax income generally use one of two systems: territorial or residence-based. In the territorial system, only local income – income from a source inside the country – is taxed. In the residence-based system, residents of the country are taxed on their worldwide (local and foreign) income, while nonresidents are taxed only on their local income. In addition, a very small number of countries, notably the [[United States]], also tax their nonresident citizens on worldwide income.

Countries with a residence-based system of taxation usually allow deductions or credits for the tax that residents already pay to other countries on their foreign income. Many countries also sign [[tax treaty|tax treaties]] with each other to eliminate or reduce [[double taxation]]. In the case of corporate income tax, some countries allow an exclusion or deferment of specific items of foreign income from the base of taxation.

===Individuals===
The following table summarizes the taxation of local and foreign income of individuals, depending on their residence or citizenship in the country. It includes 244 entries: 194 [[List of sovereign states|sovereign countries]], their 40 inhabited [[Dependent territory|dependent territories]] (most of which have separate tax systems), and 10 [[List of states with limited recognition|countries with limited recognition]].

====Residency====
Taxing regimes are generally classified as either residency based or territorial based. Most jurisdictions tax income on a residency basis. They need to define "resident" and characterize the income of nonresidents. Such definitions vary by country and type of taxpayer, but usually involve the location of the person's main home and number of days the person is physically present in the country. Examples include:

*The United States taxes its citizens as residents, and provides lengthy, detailed rules for individual residency of foreigners, covering:
**periods establishing residency (including a formulary calculation involving three years);
**start and end date of residency;
**exceptions for transitory visits, medical conditions, etc.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.,'' "[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p513.pdf Tax Information for Visitors to the United States]", Publication 513 (annual), Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Department of Treasury, page 2.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The United Kingdom, prior to 2013, established three categories: non-resident, resident, and resident but not ordinarily resident.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', "[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/pdfs/ir20.pdf Residents and non-residents]", IR20, Inland Revenue, HMRC, page 6 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; From 2013, the categories of resident are limited to non-resident and resident. Residency is established by application of the  tests in the Statutory Residency Test.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = RDR3: Statutory Residence Test - Publications - GOV.UK|url = https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rdr3-statutory-residence-test-srt|website = www.gov.uk|access-date = 2016-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Switzerland residency may be established by having a permit to be employed in Switzerland for an individual who is so employed.&lt;ref&gt;Switzerland requires a work permit to be employed in Switzerland. A person working in Switzerland for more than 30 days may be a resident. See http://www.taxation.ch/index.cfm/fuseaction/show/temp/default/path/1-534.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Territorial systems usually tax local income regardless of the residence of the taxpayer. The key problem argued for this type of system is the ability to avoid taxation on portable income by moving it outside of the country. This has led governments to enact hybrid systems to recover lost revenue.

====Citizenship====
Almost all countries tax foreign income based on residency, if at all. Only two countries in the world systematically and comprehensively tax the worldwide income of nonresident citizens:&lt;ref&gt;[https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2012/05/18/tax-history-why-u-s-pursues-citizens-overseas/ Tax History: Why U.S. Pursues Citizens Overseas], [[Wall Street Journal]], May 18, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canadian-banks-to-be-compelled-to-share-clients-info-with-u-s-1.2437975 Canadian banks to be compelled to share clients' info with U.S.], [[CBC News]], November 25, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

*{{flag|Eritrea}} taxes its nonresident citizens on their foreign income at a reduced flat rate of 2% (income tax rates for local income are progressive from 2 to 30%).&lt;ref name="imf.org"/&gt; It has been reported that Eritrea enforces this tax on its citizens abroad through denial of passports, denial of entry or exit from the country, confiscation of assets in Eritrea, and even harassment of relatives living in Eritrea, until the tax is paid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://danielberhane.wordpress.com/2011/11/20/eritrea-a-form-of-extortion-eritreas-2-diaspora-tax/ A form of extortion – Eritrea's 2% Diaspora tax], Daniel Berhane, November 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the [[United Nations]] [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] passed a [[United Nations Security Council Resolution|resolution]] [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 2023|condemning the collection of the Eritrean 'diaspora tax']].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2011/sc10471.doc.htm Security Council, by Vote of 13 in Favour, Adopts Resolution Reinforcing Sanctions Regime against Eritrea 'Calibrated' to Halt All Activities Destabilizing Region], [[United Nations]], December 5, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The governments of [[Government of Canada|Canada]] and the [[Politics of the Netherlands|Netherlands]] expelled Eritrean diplomats in 2013 and 2018, respectively, for collecting the tax.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-22708711 Canada expels Eritrea envoy over expat fees claims], [[BBC]], May 29, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw.com/en/the-netherlands-expels-eritreas-top-diplomat-over-diaspora-tax-enforcement/a-42194920 The Netherlands expels Eritrea's top diplomat over 'diaspora tax' enforcement], [[Deutsche Welle]], 17 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; The parliaments of [[Riksdag|Sweden]] and the [[European Parliament|European Union]] have also expressed their intention to prohibit the practice there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelocal.se/39304/20120224/ Riksdag wants to halt Eritrean exile taxes], [[The Local]], February 24, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=TA&amp;reference=P8-TA-2017-0309&amp;language=EN&amp;ring=P8-RC-2017-0464 European Parliament resolution of 6 July 2017 on Eritrea, notably the cases of Abune Antonios and Dawit Isaak], [[European Parliament]], 6 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{flag|United States|name=The United States}} taxes its nonresident citizens on their worldwide income using the same marginal tax rates for both foreign and U.S.-source income. To mitigate double-taxation of the same income, U.S. citizens residing in another country may [[foreign earned income exclusion|exclude some of their foreign income]] from U.S. taxation, and take [[foreign tax credit|credit for income tax paid to other countries]], but they must file a U.S. tax return to claim the exclusion or credit even if they result in no tax liability.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/uac/Information-for-U.S.-Citizens-or-Dual-Citizens-Residing-Outside-the-U.S. Information for U.S. Citizens or Dual Citizens Residing Outside the U.S.], Retrieved November 28, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; "U.S. persons" abroad, like U.S. residents, are also subject to various reporting requirements regarding foreign finances, such as [[Department of the Treasury Form 90-22.1 Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts|FBAR]], [[FATCA]], and [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] forms 3520, 5471, 8621 and 8938.

:Like Eritrea, enforcement tactics used by the U.S. government to facilitate tax compliance include the [[Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act|denial of U.S. passports to nonresident U.S. citizens deemed to be delinquent taxpayers]] and the potential seizure of any U.S. accounts and/or U.S.-based assets. The IRS can also exert substantial compliance pressure on nonresident citizens as a result of the FATCA legislation passed in 2010, which compels foreign banks to disclose U.S. account holders or face crippling fines on U.S.-related financial transactions. Unlike Eritrea, the U.S. has faced little international backlash related to its global enforcement tactics. For example, unlike their response to Eritrea's collection efforts, Canada and all EU member states have ratified intergovernmental agreements (IGAs) facilitating FATCA compliance and supporting the U.S. global tax regime in place for U.S. citizens (including dual nationals). The implementation of these IGAs has led to a [[Quarterly Publication of Individuals Who Have Chosen to Expatriate|substantial increase in U.S. citizenship renunciations]] since 2012, with wait times for renunciation appointments at the U.S. consulate in Toronto exceeding one year as of early 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/delays-costs-mount-for-canadians-renouncing-us-citizenship/article28688026/ Delays, costs mount for Canadians renouncing U.S. citizenship], [[The Globe and Mail]], 9 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

A few other countries used to tax the foreign income of nonresident citizens, but have abolished this practice:

====Other====
There are some arrangements for international taxation that are not based on residency or citizenship:
*{{flag|United Kingdom}} imposes global income tax on anyone who owes [[Student loans in the United Kingdom|UK student ''loans'']]. These are not true loans, but borrowings to be repaid through an additional 9% income tax, levied above a certain income threshold, until the balance of the loan expires in 30 years. The interest rate is expressed as a punitive addition to the UK [[Retail Price Index]] inflation rate (''e.g.'' RPI + 3%), so the value of the loan cannot be inflated away. The loan cannot be repudiated by declaring bankruptcy. The income tax is imposed irrespective of citizenship or residency, which means the UK [[HM Revenue and Customs|HMRC]] must track the location and income of all loan holders, wherever they are in the world, for several decades.

===Corporations===
Countries do not necessarily use the same system of taxation for individuals and corporations. For example, [[France]] uses a residence-based system for individuals but a territorial system for corporations,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deloitte.com/assets/Dcom-Global/Local%20Assets/Documents/Tax/Taxation%20and%20Investment%20Guides/2012/dttl_tax_highlight_2012_France.pdf International tax - France Highlights 2012], [[Deloitte]].&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Singapore]] does the opposite,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fullermoney.com/content/2012-07-17/dttl_tax_highlight_2012_Singapore.pdf International tax - Singapore Highlights 2012], [[Deloitte]].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Brunei]] and Monaco taxes corporate but not personal income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deloitte.com/assets/Dcom-Global/Local%20Assets/Documents/Tax/Taxation%20and%20Investment%20Guides/2012/dttl_tax_highlight_2012_Brunei.pdf|title=International tax - Brunei Darussalam Highlights 2012 |publisher=[[Deloitte]]|author=|date=|website=deloitte.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/globalbusiness/7243401/Monaco-might-not-charge-residents-income-tax-but-its-no-tax-haven.html Monaco might not charge residents income tax, but it's no tax haven].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Exclusion====
Many systems provide for specific exclusions from taxable (chargeable) income. For example, several countries, notably Cyprus, Luxembourg, Netherlands and Spain, have enacted holding company regimes that exclude from income dividends from certain foreign subsidiaries of corporations. These systems generally impose tax on other sorts of income, such as interest or royalties, from the same subsidiaries. They also typically have requirements for portion and time of ownership in order to qualify for exclusion. The Netherlands offers a "participation exemption" for dividends from subsidiaries of Netherlands companies. Dividends from all Dutch subsidiaries automatically qualify. For other dividends to qualify, the Dutch shareholder or affiliates must own at least 5% and the subsidiary must be subject to a certain level of income tax locally.&lt;ref&gt;The rules have changed over the years. For a good explanation of the 2006 changes by a major UK law firm, see http://www.freshfields.com/publications/pdfs/2006/corp-tax-reform.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some countries, such as the United States and Singapore,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.iras.gov.sg/irasHome/page04.aspx?id=440 What is taxable income]", Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore.&lt;/ref&gt; allow deferment of tax on foreign income of resident corporations until it is remitted to the country.

==Individuals versus enterprises==
Many tax systems tax individuals in one manner and entities that are not considered fiscally transparent in another. The differences may be as simple as differences in [[tax rates]],&lt;ref&gt;The U.S. taxes businesses generally at rates from 15% to 35%. However, the graduated rates for individuals are different from those for corporations. United States Code Title 26 sections 1 and 11, hereafter [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode26/usc_sup_01_26_10_A_20_1_30_A.html 26 USC 1 and 11]&lt;/ref&gt; and are often motivated by concerns unique to either individuals or corporations. For example, many systems allow taxable income of an individual to be reduced by a fixed amount allowance for other persons supported by the individual (dependents). Such a concept is not relevant for enterprises.

Many systems allow for fiscal transparency of certain forms of enterprise. For example, most countries tax partners of a partnership, rather than the partnership itself, on income of the partnership.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/701- 26 USC 701], ''et seq''.&lt;/ref&gt;  A common feature of income taxation is imposition of a [[Tax|levy]] on certain enterprises in certain forms followed by an additional levy on owners of the enterprise upon distribution of such income. For example, the U.S. imposes two levels of tax on foreign individuals or foreign corporations who own a U.S. corporation. First, the U.S. corporation is subject to the regular income tax on its profits, then subject to an additional 30% tax on the dividends paid to foreign shareholders (the branch profits tax). The foreign corporation will be subject to U.S. income tax on its effectively connected income, and will also be subject to the branch profits tax on any of its profits not reinvested in the U.S.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Thus, many countries tax corporations under company tax rules and tax individual shareholders upon corporate distributions. Various countries have tried (and some still maintain) attempts at partial or full "integration" of the enterprise and owner taxation. Where a two level system is present but allows for fiscal transparency of some entities, definitional issues become very important.

==Source of income==
Determining the source of income is of critical importance in a territorial system, as source often determines whether or not the income is taxed. For example, Hong Kong does not tax residents on [[dividend|dividend income]] received from a non-Hong Kong corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.hk/en/residents/taxes/salaries/salariestax/exemption/employee.htm|title=www.gov.hk/en/residents/taxes/salaries/salariestax/exemption/employee.htm&lt;!--INSERT TITLE--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Source of income is also important in residency systems that grant credits for taxes of other jurisdictions. Such credit is often limited either by jurisdiction or to the local tax on overall income from other jurisdictions.

Source of income is where the income is considered to arise under the relevant tax system. The manner of determining the source of income is generally dependent on the nature of income. Income from the performance of [[Service (economics)|services]] (e.g., wages) is generally treated as arising where the services are performed.&lt;ref&gt;''Supra''. [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/861- 26 USC 861(a)(3)]&lt;/ref&gt; Financing income (e.g., interest, dividends) is generally treated as arising where the user of the financing resides.&lt;ref&gt;26 USC 861(a)(1) and (2) and 862(a)(1) and (2), ''supra''.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|reason=other example citations needed|date=September 2011}} Income related to use of [[tangible property]] (e.g., rents) is generally treated as arising where the property is situated.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. IRC sections 861(a)(4) and 862(a)(4), ''supra''.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|reason=other example citations needed|date=September 2011}} Income related to use of [[intangible property]] (e.g., royalties) is generally treated as arising where the property is used. Gains on sale of realty are generally treated as arising where the property is situated.

Gains from sale of tangible personal property are sourced differently in different jurisdictions. The U.S. treats such gains in three distinct manners: a) gain from sale of purchased inventory is sourced based on where title to the goods passes;&lt;ref&gt;26 USC 861(a)(6) and 862(a)(6), ''supra''.)&lt;/ref&gt; b) gain from sale of inventory produced by the person (or certain related persons) is sourced 50% based on title passage and 50% based on location of production and certain assets;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/863- 26 USC 863(b)].&lt;/ref&gt; c) other gains are sourced based on the residence of the seller.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/865- 26 USC 865(a)]. (other examples needed)&lt;/ref&gt;

In specific cases, the tax system may diverge for different categories of individuals. U.S. citizen and resident [[Alien (law)#Categories|alien]] decedents are subject to [[estate tax]] on all of their assets, wherever situated. The nonresident aliens are subject to estate tax only on that part of the gross estate which at the time of death is situated in the U.S. Another significant distinction between U.S. citizens/RAs and NRAs is in the exemptions allowed in computing the tax liability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview of International Estate Planning |author=Robert F. Klueger |publisher=Valley Lawyer |date=2012 |url=http://ksilaw.com/uploads/general/Bob-Valley-Lawyer-Article-Oct-2012.pdf |accessdate=June 26, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726190534/http://ksilaw.com/uploads/general/Bob-Valley-Lawyer-Article-Oct-2012.pdf |archivedate=July 26, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where differing characterizations of an item of income can result in differing tax results, it is necessary to determine the characterization. Some systems have rules for resolving characterization issues, but in many cases resolution requires judicial intervention.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', Pierre Boulez, in which a U.S. court determined that income received by a performer relating to sale of recordings of a musical performance was sourced to where such recordings were purchased by consumers.&lt;/ref&gt;  Note that some systems which allow a credit for foreign taxes source income by reference to foreign law.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', [http://law.incometaxindia.gov.in/TaxmannDit/DispCitation/ShowCit.aspx?fn=http://law.incometaxindia.gov.in/DitTaxmann/IncomeTaxActs/2008ITAct/section91.htm India’s rules]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Definitions of income===
Some jurisdictions tax [[net income]] as determined under financial accounting concepts of that jurisdiction, with few, if any, modifications.{{Citation needed|reason=example citations needed|date=September 2011}} Other jurisdictions determine [[taxable income]] without regard to income reported in [[financial statements]].&lt;ref&gt;The U.S. and many of its states define taxable income independently of financial statement income, but require reconciliation of the two. See, ''e.g.'', [http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=rtc&amp;group=17001-18000&amp;file=17071-17078 California Revenue and Taxation Code sections 17071] ''et seq''.&lt;/ref&gt; Some jurisdictions compute taxable income by reference to financial statement income with specific categories of adjustments, which can be significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pbg/tf/t2sch1/t2sch1-08e.pdf|title=www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pbg/tf/t2sch1/t2sch1-08e.pdf&lt;!--INSERT TITLE--&gt;|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A jurisdiction relying on [[income statement|financial statement income]] tends to place reliance on the judgment of local accountants for determinations of income under locally accepted accounting principles. Often such jurisdictions have a requirement that financial statements be audited by registered accountants who must opine thereon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/about/gbhtml/gba4.shtml#c1q1|title=Auditors - GBA4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some jurisdictions extend the audit requirements to include opining on such tax issues as [[transfer pricing]].{{Citation needed|reason=citation needed for India|date=September 2011}} Jurisdictions not relying on financial statement income must attempt to define principles of [[Revenue recognition|income and expense recognition]], [[Cost basis|asset cost recovery]], [[Matching principle|matching]], and other concepts within the tax law. These definitional issues can become very complex. Some jurisdictions following this approach also require business taxpayers to provide a reconciliation of financial statement and taxable incomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1120sm3.pdf|title=U.S. IRS Form 1120 Schedule M-3]; [http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pbg/tf/t2sch1/t2sch1-08e.pdf Canadian CRA Form T-2 Schedule 1|author=|date=|website=irs.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deductions===
{{details|Tax deduction}}
Systems that allow a tax deduction of [[expenses]] in computing [[taxable income]] must provide for rules for allocating such expenses between classes of income. Such classes may be taxable versus non-taxable, or may relate to computations of credits for taxes of other systems (foreign taxes). A system which does not provide such rules is subject to manipulation by potential taxpayers.  The manner of allocation of expenses varies. U.S. rules provide for allocation of an expense to a class of income if the expense directly relates to such class, and apportionment of an expense related to multiple classes. Specific rules are provided for certain categories of more fungible expenses, such as interest.&lt;ref name="1.861-8"&gt;[http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2008/aprqtr/26cfr1.861-8.htm U.S. regulations under 26 CFR 1.861-8], et seq. at  (hereafter U.S. regulations §)&lt;/ref&gt;  By their nature, rules for allocation and apportionment of expenses may become complex. They may incorporate [[cost accounting]] or branch accounting principles,&lt;ref name="1.861-8" /&gt; or may define new principles.

===Thin capitalization===
{{main|Thin capitalization}}
Most jurisdictions provide that taxable income may be reduced by amounts expended as interest on loans. By contrast, most do not provide tax relief for distributions to owners.&lt;ref&gt;Contrast to "integrated" systems providing a credit to enterprise owners for a portion of enterprise level taxation.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, an enterprise is motivated to finance its subsidiary enterprises through [[loan]]s rather than [[Financial capital|capital]]. Many jurisdictions have adopted "thin capitalization" rules to limit such charges. Various approaches include limiting deductibility of interest expense to a portion of [[cash flow]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/163- 26 USC 163(j)] and long proposed regulations thereunder&lt;/ref&gt; disallowing interest expense on [[debt]] in excess of a certain ratio,{{Citation needed|reason=UK or Germany citation needed|date=September 2011}} and other mechanisms.

===Enterprise restructure===
The organization or reorganization of portions of a [[multinational enterprise]] often gives rise to events that, absent rules to the contrary, may be taxable in a particular system. Most systems contain rules preventing recognition of income or loss from certain types of such events. In the simplest form, contribution of business assets to a subsidiary enterprise may, in certain circumstances, be treated as a nontaxable event.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/351- 26 USC 351].&lt;/ref&gt; Rules on structuring and restructuring tend to be highly complex.

==Credits for taxes of other jurisdictions==
{{further|Tax credit|Foreign tax credit}}
Systems that tax income earned outside the system's jurisdiction tend to provide for a unilateral credit or offset for taxes paid to other jurisdictions. Such other jurisdiction taxes are generally referred to within the system as "foreign" taxes. Tax [[treaties]]  often require this credit.  A credit for foreign taxes is subject to manipulation by planners if there are no limits, or weak limits, on such credit. Generally, the credit is at least limited to the tax within the system that the taxpayer would pay on income earned outside the jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', [http://www.mof.gov.eg/NR/rdonlyres/6CA93BFB-B974-497C-98C9-F57C3CD146CE/0/IncomeTaxLaw.pdf Egypt limits] the credit to the Egyptian income tax "that may have been payable with respect to profits from works performed abroad," but without a thorough definition of terms. Article (54).&lt;/ref&gt; The credit may be limited by category of income,&lt;ref&gt;U.S. rules limit the credit by categories based on the nature of the income. [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/904- 26 USC 904]. For 20 years prior to changes first effective in 2007, there were at least nine such categories. These included, e.g., financial services income, high-taxed income, other passive income, and other (operating or general) income. UK rules provide for separate limitations based on the schedule of income on which UK tax is computed. Thus, credits were separately limited for salaries versus dividends and interest.&lt;/ref&gt; by other jurisdiction or country, based on an effective [[tax rate]], or otherwise. Where the foreign tax credit is limited, such limitation may involve computation of [[taxable income]] from other jurisdictions. Such computations tend to rely heavily on the source of income and allocation of expense rules of the system.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', under U.S. rules, the credit is limited to U.S. tax on foreign source taxable income for a particular category. The rules for determining source for taxation of foreign persons ([https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode26/usc_sup_01_26_10_A_20_1_30_N_40_I.html sections 861-865]) apply in computing such credit, and detailed rules are provided in regulations (above) for allocating and apportioning expenses to such income.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Withholding tax==
{{details|Withholding tax}}
Many jurisdictions require persons paying amounts to nonresidents to collect tax due from a nonresident with respect to certain income by withholding such tax from such payments and remitting the tax to the government.&lt;ref&gt;Materials from one major accounting firm provide a table of over sixty such countries. Such table is not comprehensive.&lt;/ref&gt; Such levies are generally referred to as withholding taxes. These requirements are induced because of potential difficulties in collection of the tax from nonresidents. Withholding taxes are often imposed at rates differing from the prevailing income tax rates.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', Australia imposes a 10% withholding tax rate on interest, subject to treaty reduction.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the rate of withholding may vary by type of income or type of recipient.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', Thailand taxes dividends at 10% and interest at 15%.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', Italy taxes dividends paid to nonresidents having voting rights in the company paying the dividends at 27% but taxes dividends paid to nonresidents not having such rights at 12.5%.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, withholding taxes are reduced or eliminated under income tax treaties (see below). Generally, withholding taxes are imposed on the gross amount of income, unreduced by expenses.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/871- 26 USC 871], [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/881- 881], and [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/871- 1441].&lt;/ref&gt; Such taxation provides for great simplicity of administration but can also reduce the taxpayer's awareness of the amount of tax being collected.&lt;ref name="treasury"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ustreas.gov/education/fact-sheets/taxes/ustax.shtml| last=| first=| title=History of the U.S. Tax System| work=| publisher=U.S. Department of Treasury| date=| accessdate=2006-10-31| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127050245/http://www.treasury.gov/education/fact-sheets/taxes/ustax.shtml| archivedate=2010-11-27| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treaties==
{{main|Tax treaty}}
[[File:OECD.svg|thumb|{{legend|#333366|OECD members}}{{legend|#666699|Accession candidate countries}}{{legend|#9999CC|Enhanced engagement countries}}]]
[[File:German GDP in tax havens.png|thumb|Ratio of German assets in [[tax haven]]s to German GDP, 1996–2008.&lt;ref&gt;Shafik Hebous (2011) [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1934164 "Money at the Docks of Tax Havens: A Guide"], CESifo Working Paper Series No. 3587, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Havens in countries with tax information sharing allowing for compliance enforcement have been in decline. The "Big 7" shown are Hong Kong, Ireland, Lebanon, Liberia, Panama, Singapore, and Switzerland.]]

[[Tax treaties]] exist between many countries on a bilateral basis to prevent [[double taxation]] ([[tax]]es levied twice on the same [[income]], [[Profit (accounting)|profit]], [[capital gain]], [[inheritance]] or other item). In some countries they are also known as double taxation agreements, double tax treaties, or ''[[tax information exchange agreements]]'' (TIEA).

Most developed countries have a large number of tax treaties, while developing countries are less well represented in the worldwide tax treaty network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|ssrn=705541|last=Christians|first=Allison|title= Tax Treaties for Investment and Aid to Sub-Saharan Africa: A Case Study|date= April 2005|journal= Northwestern Public Law Research Paper No. 05-10; Northwestern Law &amp; Econ Research Paper No. 05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Kingdom]] has treaties with more than 110 countries and territories. The [[United States]] has treaties with 56 countries (as of February 2007). Tax treaties tend not to exist, or to be of limited application, when either party regards the other as a [[tax haven]]. There are a number of model tax treaties published by various national and international bodies, such as the [[United Nations]] and the [[OECD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital 2014|url=http://www.oecd.org/tax/treaties/model-tax-convention-on-income-and-on-capital-2015-full-version-9789264239081-en.htm|publisher=OECD|date=October 30, 2015|accessdate=2016-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Treaties tend to provide reduced rates of taxation on [[dividends]], [[interest]], and [[royalties]]. They tend to impose limits on each treaty country in taxing business profits, permitting taxation only in the presence of a [[permanent establishment]] in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Permanent establishment is defined under most treaties using language identical to the OECD model. Generally, a permanent establishment is any fixed place of business, including an office, warehouse, etc.&lt;/ref&gt; Treaties tend to impose limits on taxation of salaries and other income for performance of services. They also tend to have "tie breaker" clauses for resolving conflicts between residency rules. Nearly all treaties have at least skeletal mechanisms for resolving disputes, generally negotiated between the "competent authority" section of each country's taxing authority.

==Anti-deferral measures==
Residency systems may provide that residents are not subject to tax on income outside the jurisdiction until that income is remitted to the jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Singapore's provision that income from outside its borders is not taxed until brought onshore.&lt;/ref&gt; Taxpayers in such systems have significant incentives to shift income outside its borders. Depending on the rules of the system, the shifting may occur by changing the location of activities generating income or by shifting income to separate enterprises owned by the taxpayer. Most residency systems have avoided rules which permit [[Deferral|deferring]] income from outside its borders without shifting it to a subsidiary enterprise due to the potential for manipulation of such rules. Where owners of an enterprise are taxed separately from the enterprise, portable income may be shifted from a taxpayer to a subsidiary enterprise to accomplish deferral or elimination of tax. Such systems tend to have rules to limit such deferral through controlled [[foreign corporation]]s. Several different approaches have been used by countries for their anti-deferral rules.&lt;ref&gt;Anti-deferral and other shifting measures have also been combatted by granting broad powers to revenue authorities under "general anti-avoidance" provisions.  See a discussion of Canadian GAAR a [http://www.ctf.ca/pdf/04ctjpdf/04ctj2-arnold.pdf CTF article].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, rules provides that U.S. [[shareholders]] of a [[Controlled Foreign Corporation]] (CFC) must include their shares of income or investment of E&amp;P by the CFC in U.S. property.&lt;ref name="subpartf"&gt;Subpart F ([https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode26/usc_sup_01_26_10_A_20_1_30_N_40_III_50_F.html sections 951-964])&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. shareholders are U.S. persons owning 10% or more (after the application of complex attribution of ownership rules) of a foreign corporation. Such persons may include individuals, corporations, partnerships, trusts, estates, and other juridical persons. A CFC is a foreign corporation more than 50% owned by U.S. shareholders. This income includes several categories of portable income, including most investment income, certain resale income, and certain services income. Certain exceptions apply, including the exclusion from Subpart F income of CFC income subject to an effective foreign tax rate of 90% or more of the top U.S. [[tax rate]].&lt;ref name="subpartf" /&gt;

The United Kingdom provides that a UK company is taxed currently on the income of its controlled subsidiary companies managed and controlled outside the UK which are subject to "low" foreign taxes.&lt;ref&gt;Part XVII of Chapter IV ICTA 1988&lt;/ref&gt; Low tax is determined as actual tax of less than three-fourths of the corresponding UK tax that would be due on the income determined under UK principles. Complexities arise in computing the corresponding UK tax. Further, there are certain exceptions which may permit deferral, including a "white list" of permitted countries and a 90% earnings distribution policy of the controlled company. Further, anti-deferral does not apply where there is no tax avoidance motive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/intmanual/INTM200000.htm|title=INTM200000 - International Manual - HMRC internal manual - GOV.UK|author=|date=|website=www.hmrc.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rules in [[Germany]] provide that a German individual or company shareholder of a foreign corporation may be subject to current German tax on certain passive income earned by the foreign corporation. This provision applies if the foreign corporation is taxed at less than 25% of the passive income, as defined.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} [[Japan]] and some other countries have followed a "[[black list]]" approach, where income of subsidiaries in countries identified as [[tax haven]]s is subject to current tax to the shareholder. [[Sweden]] has adopted a "[[white list]]" of countries in which subsidiaries may be organized so that the shareholder is not subject to current tax.

==Transfer pricing==
{{main|Transfer pricing}}
The setting of the amount of related party charges is commonly referred to as transfer pricing. Many jurisdictions have become sensitive to the potential for shifting profits with transfer pricing, and have adopted rules regulating setting or testing of prices or allowance of deductions or inclusion of income for related party transactions. Many jurisdictions have adopted broadly similar transfer pricing rules. The [[OECD]] has adopted (subject to specific country reservations) fairly comprehensive guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecdbookshop.org/oecd/display.asp?sf1=identifiers&amp;st1=232001041P1|title=Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations}}&lt;/ref&gt; These guidelines have been adopted with little modification by many countries.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', [http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/intmanual/INTM430000.htm UK ICTA Section 28AA and guidelines thereunder]&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, the U.S. and Canada have adopted rules which depart in some material respects from OECD guidelines, generally by providing more detailed rules.

[[Arm's length principle]]: It is a key concept of most transfer pricing rules, that prices charged between related enterprises should be those which would be charged between unrelated parties dealing at arm's length. Most sets of rules prescribe methods for testing whether prices charged should be considered to meet this standard. Such rules generally involve comparison of related party transactions to similar transactions of unrelated parties (comparable prices or transactions). Various surrogates for such transactions may be allowed. Most guidelines allow the following methods for testing prices: Comparable uncontrolled transaction prices, resale prices based on comparable markups, cost plus a markup, and an enterprise profitability method.

== Tax avoidance ==
[[Tax avoidance]] schemes may take advantage of low or no-income tax countries known as [[tax haven]]s. Corporations may choose to move their headquarters to a country with more favorable tax environments. In countries where movement has been restricted by legislation, it might be necessary to reincorporate into a low-tax company through reversing a merger with a foreign corporation ("inversion" similar to a [[reverse merger]]). In addition, transfer pricing may allow for "earnings stripping" as profits are attributed to subsidiaries in low-tax countries.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of the Treasury. (2007). [http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/Documents/ajca2007.pdf Earnings Stripping, Transfer Pricing and U.S. Income Tax Treaties].&lt;/ref&gt;

For individuals [[tax avoidance]] has become a major issue for governments worldwide since the 2008 recession. These tax directives began when the United States introduced the [[Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act]] (FATCA) in 2010, and were greatly expanded by the work of The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD).  The OECD introduced a new international system for the automatic exchange of tax information – known as the [[Common Reporting Standard]] (CRS) – to which around 100 countries have committed. For some taxpayers, the CRS is already “live”; for others it is imminent. The goal of this worldwide exchange of tax information is tax transparency, and has aroused concerns about privacy and data breaches due to the sheer volume of information that is going to be exchanged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Knight|first=Andrew|date=23 November 2016|title="Is there room for privacy planning in a tax-transparent world?"|url=http://www.internationalinvestment.net/opinion/room-privacy-planning-tax-transparent-world-maitland/|journal=International Investment|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garnham|first=Caroline|date=22 July 2016|title="HNWIs, FATCA &amp; CRS: Is Privacy Dead?"|url=http://theprivateclienthub.com/fatca-crs-privacy-dead/|journal=Private Client Hub|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Expanded Worldwide Planning (EWP)]] is an element of international taxation created in the wake of tax directives from government tax authorities after the worldwide recession beginning in 2008. At the heart of EWP is a properly constructed [[Private placement life insurance]] (PPLI) policy that allows taxpayers to use the regulatory framework of [[life insurance]] to structure their [[assets]]. These assets can be located anywhere in the world and at the same time can be brought into compliance with tax authorities worldwide.  EWP also brings [[asset protection]] and [[privacy]] benefits that are set forward in the six principals of EWP.

'''''L'Alba''''' was an [[Italian-language]] fascist weekly newspaper published from [[Tunis]], [[Tunisia]].&lt;ref name="p2"&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=IlnQAAAAMAAJ Nomenclature des journaux &amp; revues en langue française du monde entier]''. Paris, Les bureaux de l'Argus, 1937. p. 467&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="s2"&gt;Brondino, Michele.

Associazione fra le imprese italiane in Africa, 2007. p. 452&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded by Giuseppe Colombo and R. A. Oliva, with the first issue published on 5 September 1935.&lt;ref name="p2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="s2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="m2"&gt;Bessis, Juliette.

Regarding the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|war against Ethiopia]], ''l'Alba'' boasted of having two companies of [[blackshirts]] from Tunisia, "Numidie" and "Zama", at the battle-fields. The publication attacked [[freemasonry|freemasons]] and anti-fascists, while appealing to Italians to buy products from their own nation. The British consulate found the diatribes in ''l'Alba'' insulting to [[Great Britain]] and [[Malta]], and lodged a formal complaint against the publication. It was subsequently shut down by French colonial authorities - with the last issue published on 14 November 1935.&lt;ref name="m2"/&gt;

The '''Lazarević''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Лазаревић}}, {{small|[[plural|pl.]]}} Lazarevići / Лазаревићи, {{IPA-sh|lazǎːrɛv̞itɕ|pron}}) was a [[Serbs|Serbian]] medieval [[royal family]], which ruled [[Moravian Serbia]] and the [[Serbian Despotate]].

The dynasty began with [[Lazar Hrebeljanović]], son of [[Pribac Hrebeljanović]]-a noble at the court of [[Dušan the Mighty]]. Lazar married [[Princess Milica|Milica]], supposedly a member of the reigning [[Nemanjić dynasty]], and was later given the title "Knez" by [[List of Serbian monarchs|Serbian Emperor]] [[Uroš the Weak]]. He gained lands in Central Serbia and through his ties with the Nemanjićs he became the regent of [[Moravian Serbia]]. In the [[Battle of Kosovo]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]], Lazar was killed and Serbia became a vassal state, leading to the end of Serbian sovereignty.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22231">The '''Legatum Prosperity Index''' is an annual ranking developed by the Legatum Institute, a division of the private investment firm [[Legatum]]. The ranking is based on a variety of factors including wealth, [[economic growth]], education, health, [[well-being|personal well-being]], and [[quality of life]]. In the 2017 rankings, 149 countries were ranked, and [[Norway]] topped the list, followed by [[New Zealand]] and [[Finland]] and [[Yemen]] was on the last place. In 2013, twenty-seven of the top 30 countries were democracies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/jeffrey-gedmin-on-the-role-of-governance-and-the-rule-of-law-in-advancing-development Project Syndicate, Development's Democratic Drivers, Jeffrey Gedmin]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Prosperity of countries according to the Legatum Prosperity Index (2017).png|thumb|480px|Prosperity of countries on a green to red scale according to the 2017 Legatum Prosperity Index]]

== Methodology ==

The 2017 Legatum Prosperity Index is based on 104 different variables analysed across 149 nations around the world. Source data includes [[Gallup (company)|Gallup World Poll]], [[World Development Indicators]], [[International Telecommunication Union]], [[Fragile States Index]], [[Worldwide Governance Indicators]], [[Freedom house|Freedom House]], [[World Health Organization|World Health Organisation]], [[World Values Survey]], [[Amnesty international|Amnesty International]], Centre for Systemic Peace. The 104 variables are grouped into 9 sub-indexes, which are averaged using equal weights. The 9 sub-indexes are:

* Economic Quality
* Business Environment
* Governance
* Education
* Health
* Safety &amp; Security
* Personal Freedom
* Social Capital
* Natural Environment

For example, Personal Freedom includes freedom of speech and religion, national tolerance for immigrants and ethnic and racial minorities.  The Social Capital sub-index includes the percentage of citizens who volunteer, give to charity, help strangers, and who feel they can rely on family and friends.

[[Oxford Analytica]] assisted in the early development of the Prosperity Index and has contributed to shaping the methodology. Today, the annual Index is produced and published by the Legatum Institute.

The Legatum Institute operates a transparent approach to its work on the Prosperity Index. To that end, the entire methodology of the Prosperity Index along with the data used to create it is available for free online at the institute's website.

The '''Minidish''' is the tradename used for the small-sized [[satellite dish]] used by [[Freesat]] and [[Sky (United Kingdom)|Sky]]. The term has entered the vocabulary in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] as a [[Genericized trademark|generic term]] for a satellite dish, particularly small ones.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

The Minidish is an oval, [[mesh satellite dish]] capable of reflecting signals broadcast in the upper [[X band]] and {{Ku band}}. Two sizes exist:
*"Zone 1" dishes are issued in southern [[England]] and were 43&amp;nbsp;cm vertically prior to 2009; newer mark 4 dishes are approximately 50&amp;nbsp;cm
*"Zone 2" dishes are issued in elsewhere ([[Wales]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Republic of Ireland]], [[Scotland]] and northern England), which are 57&amp;nbsp;cm vertically.

The Minidish uses a non-standard connector for the [[Low-noise block converter|LNB]], consisting of a peg about {{convert|4|cm|in|abbr=on}} in width and {{convert|7.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} in height prior to the mark 4 dishes introduced in 2009, as opposed to the 40&amp;nbsp;mm collar.{{Clarify|to what does the 40mm collar refer; other, "standard", dishes, post mark 4 dishes, or both?|date=July 2011}} This enforces the use of Sky-approved equipment, but also ensures that a suitable LNB is used. Due to the shape of the dish, an LNB with an oval [[feedhorn]] is required to get full signal.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.satcure.co.uk/tech/lnb.htm#SX1019&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Operation Rubicon''' was a Scottish police investigation into allegations of [[phone hacking]], breach of [[Information privacy|data protection]] and [[Perjury#United Kingdom|perjury]].&lt;ref name=StrathPol&gt;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strathclyde.police.uk/index.asp?locID=1586&amp;docID=8776|title=Statement published by Strathclyde Police|publisher=Strathclyde Police|date=July 2011|accessdate=2011-08-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110924003230/http://www.strathclyde.police.uk/index.asp?locID=1586&amp;docID=8776|archivedate=2011-09-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The operation was initiated by a complaint from [[Tommy Sheridan]]'s family solicitor, [[Aamer Anwar]], including allegations of perjury, phone hacking and breach of data protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdeeofof.moonfruit.com/download/i/mark_dl/u/4008566780/4550766590/22nd%20Jul%2711%20-%20Press%20Release%20by%20Aamer%20Anwar.pdf|title=Statement published by Aamer Anwar|publisher=Aamer Anwar|date=22 July 2011|accessdate=2011-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The operation was a major investigation, led by [[Superintendent (police)#United Kingdom|Detective Superintendent]] John McSporran.&lt;ref name=StrathPol/&gt; ''[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]'' has reported that 50 officers are assigned to the case&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.met.police.uk/News/Man-arrested-in-connection-with-phone-hacking-and-corruption-allegations/1260269192692/1257246745756|title=Strathclyde force assigns 50 officers to phone-hack probe|publisher=Scottish Herald|date=18 August 2011|accessdate=2011-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The investigation detained [[Andy Coulson]] on 30 May 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

On 3 June 2015, Coulson was formally acquitted after a judge dismissed the case against him.

[[Limerick]] has had an amount of pirate [[radio station]]s over the years; however, not many of these have had sufficient longevity to make a significant impact.

The biggest radio stations in the region from the late 70s to mid-80s were [[Raidio Luimni]] (8 years), www.BigLradiolimerick.com (7 years), Hits 954. (3 years) and RLWE ([[Radio Limerick Weekly Echo]]) (6 months).

Other reasonably-significant radio stations in the area over the years included Independent Radio Limerick, CCR (City Centre Radio), Radio Vera, Radio Munster, SoundChannel and Mid-West Radio (a name since adopted somewhat confusingly by a legal radio station in Mayo, in the West of Ireland).

Following the biggest closedown of the pirates in Ireland in 1988, and the subsequent legalisation of local radio services in the country, many people viewed that the pirate era was consigned to the past, and Limerick became home to a single government-licensed service called [[Radio Limerick One]] which ironically later had its broadcasting licence revoked only to continue operating as a pirate station (RLO) for 10 years, being constantly raided and fined, finally ceasing transmission after 10 years early 2007 as owners and engineers ventured to other projects.

The inexplicable failure to offer more choice - Limerick had initially been earmarked for at least two stations - meant that inevitably a number of pirate stations reappeared, the biggest ones being Kiss FM, Radio Magic 107.6FM, Galtee Radio, Country Gold, Estuary,
NCW 106, and Wave FM, which later became Galaxy 105. There were also all-too-brief appearances of Q101, Power 98FM, Club FM, Fresh 103 and Enterprise Radio
In 2009 Radio-Filou has been broadcasting for a year and has catered for listeners from the alternative audience, sharing content with Rascal Radio in Galway. Public interest started to grow in both stations, but eventually the limerick branch disappeared and the Galway Studio was subject to a raid.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1881">'''Richimund''' or '''Rechimund''' was a [[Suevi]]c leader in [[Kingdom of Galicia|Galicia]] from 457 until about 464. He was not recorded as a king (''rex''), though Hydatius wrote that ''inter Frumarium et Rechimundum oritur de regni potestate dissensio'' ("between Frumar and Rechimund arose a dissension of the power of the kingdom"). In 457 the Suevi split into two factions, one headed by [[Maldras]] raiding [[Lusitania]] and another led by [[Framta]] remaining in Galicia. After a few months of rule, Framta died and Rechimund appeared as his successor. While it is possible that the Suevi were living under a [[diarchy]], it is more likely that the two factions remained independent of one another. Maldras' eventual successor, [[Frumar]], was also not described as a king, but in 464 or thereabouts the entire Suevic nation was unified under a king named [[Remismund]]. Presumably, Rechimund and Frumar had battled for the throne and both had been eliminated, paving the way for Remismund. Some scholars have equated Remismund with Rechimund, but this seems far-fetched.
