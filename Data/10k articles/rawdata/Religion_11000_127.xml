By [[Sandro Botticelli]] (between 1480 and 1490). According to [[Carl Gustav Jung]], hell represents, among every culture, the disturbing aspect of the collective unconscious.]]
'''Collective unconscious''' ({{lang-de|kollektives Unbewusstes}}), a term coined by [[Carl Jung]], refers to structures of the [[unconscious mind]] which are shared among beings of the same species. According to Jung, the human collective unconscious is populated by [[instinct]]s and by [[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]]: universal symbols such as [[The Great Mother]], the [[Wise Old Man]], the [[Shadow_(psychology)|Shadow]], the Tower, Water, the [[Tree of Life]], and many more.

Jung considered the collective unconscious to underpin and surround the [[unconscious mind]], distinguishing it from the [[personal unconscious]] of Freudian [[psychoanalysis]]. He argued that the collective unconscious had profound influence on the lives of individuals, who lived out its symbols and clothed them in meaning through their experiences. The psychotherapeutic practice of [[analytical psychology]] revolves around examining the patient's relationship to the collective unconscious.

Psychiatrist and Jungian analyst Lionel Corbett argues that the contemporary terms "autonomous psyche" or "objective psyche" are more commonly used today in the practice of depth psychology rather than the traditional term of the "collective unconscious."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Corbett|first1=Lionel|title=Psyche and the Sacred: Spirituality beyond Religion|date=2012|publisher=Spring Journal Books|isbn=978-1-882670-34-5|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of the collective unconscious concept have called it unscientific and fatalistic, or otherwise very difficult to test scientifically (due to the mythical aspect of the collective unconscious).&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to Psychology, 5th edition&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents suggest that it is borne out by findings of psychology, neuroscience, and anthropology.

== Basic explanation ==
The term "collective unconscious" first appeared in Jung's 1916 essay, "The Structure of the Unconscious".&lt;ref&gt;Young-Eisendrath &amp; Dawson, ''Cambridge Companion to Jung'' (2008), "Chronology" (pp. xxiii–xxxvii). According to the 1953 ''Collected Works'' editors, the 1916 essay was translated by M. Marsen from German into French and published as "La Structure de l'inconscient" in ''[[Archives de Psychologie]]'' XVI (1916); they state that the original German manuscript no longer exists.&lt;/ref&gt; This essay distinguishes between the "personal", Freudian unconscious, filled with sexual fantasies and repressed images, and the "collective" unconscious encompassing the soul of humanity at large.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, ''Collected Works'' vol. 7 (1953), "The Structure of the Unconscious" (1916), ¶437–507 (pp. 263–292).&lt;/ref&gt;

In "The Significance of Constitution and Heredity in Psychology" (November 1929), Jung wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;And the essential thing, psychologically, is that in dreams, fantasies, and other exceptional states of mind the most far-fetched mythological motifs and symbols can appear autochthonously at any time, often, apparently, as the result of particular influences, traditions, and excitations working on the individual, but more often without any sign of them. These "primordial images" or "archetypes," as I have called them, belong to the basic stock of the unconscious psyche and cannot be explained as personal acquisitions. Together they make up that psychic stratum which has been called the collective unconscious. &lt;br /&gt; 
The existence of the collective unconscious means that individual consciousness is anything but a ''tabula rasa'' and is not immune to predetermining influences. On the contrary, it is in the highest degree influenced by inherited presuppositions, quite apart from the unavoidable influences exerted upon it by the environment. The collective unconscious comprises in itself the psychic life of our ancestors right back to the earliest beginnings. It is the matrix of all conscious psychic occurrences, and hence it exerts an influence that compromises the freedom of consciousness in the highest degree, since it is continually striving to lead all conscious processes back into the old paths.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, ''Collected Works'' vol. 8 (1960), "The Significance of Constitution and Heredity in Psychology" (1929), ¶229–230 (p. 112).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On October 19, 1936, Jung delivered a lecture "The Concept of the Collective Unconscious" to the Abernethian Society at [[St. Bartholomew's Hospital]] in London.&lt;ref name=ConceptOfThe&gt;Jung, ''Collected Works'' vol. 9.I (1959), "The Concept of the Collective Unconscious" (1936), p. 42. Editors' note: "Originally given as a lecture to the Abernethian Society at St. Bartholomew's Hospital, London, on October 19, 1936, and published in the Hospital's ''Journal'', XLIV (1936/37), 46–49, 64–66. The present version has been slightly revised by the author and edited in terminology."&lt;/ref&gt; He said:

&lt;blockquote&gt; My thesis then, is as follows: in addition to our immediate consciousness, which is of a thoroughly personal nature and which we believe to be the only empirical psyche (even if we tack on the personal unconscious as an appendix), there exists a second psychic system of a collective, universal, and impersonal nature which is identical in all individuals. This collective unconscious does not develop individually but is inherited. It consists of pre-existent forms, the archetypes, which can only become conscious secondarily and which give definite form to certain psychic contents.&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''The Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious'' (London 1996) p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jung linked the collective unconscious to 'what Freud called "archaic remnants" &amp;ndash; mental forms whose presence cannot be explained by anything in the individual's own life and which seem to be aboriginal, innate, and inherited shapes of the human mind'.&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''Man and his Symbols'' (London 1978) p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; He credited Freud for developing his "primal horde" theory in ''[[Totem and Taboo]]'' and continued further with the idea of an archaic ancestor maintaining its influence in the minds of present-day humans. Every human being, he wrote, "however high his conscious development, is still an archaic man at the deeper levels of his psyche."&lt;ref&gt;Singer, ''Culture and the Collective Unconscious'' (1968), pp. 30–31. Quoting Jung, ''Collected Works'' vol. 10 (1964), "Archaic Man" (1931), ¶105 (p. 51).&lt;/ref&gt;

As modern humans go through their process of [[individuation]], moving out of the collective unconscious into mature selves, they establish a [[Persona (psychology)|persona]]—which can be understood simply as that small portion of the collective psyche which they embody, perform, and identify with.&lt;ref&gt;Singer, ''Culture and the Collective Unconscious'' (1968), p. 122. "The contents which refuse to fit into this image which man tries to present to his world are either overlooked and forgotten, or repressed and denied. What is left is an arbitrary segment of collective psyche, which Jung has called the &lt;u&gt;persona&lt;/u&gt;. The word &lt;u&gt;persona&lt;/u&gt; is appropriate, since it originally meant the mask worn by an actor, signifying the role he played."&lt;/ref&gt;

The collective unconscious exerts overwhelming influence on the minds of individuals. These effects of course vary widely, since they involve virtually every emotion and situation. At times, the collective unconscious can terrify, but it can also heal.&lt;ref name=Glass1974 /&gt;

== Distinction from related concepts ==
Jung contrasted the collective unconscious with the [[personal unconscious]], the unique aspects of an individual study which Jung says constitute the focus of [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Alfred Adler]].&lt;ref&gt;Jung, ''Collected Works'' vol. 9.I (1959), "The Concept of the Collective Unconscious" (1936), ¶91 (p. 43). "Medical psychology, growing as it did out of professional practice, insists on the ''personal'' nature of the psyche. By this I mean the views of Freud and Adler. It is a ''psychology of the person'', and its aetiological or causal factors are regarded almost wholly as personal in nature."&lt;/ref&gt; Psychotherapy patients, it seemed to Jung, often described fantasies and dreams which repeated elements from ancient mythology. These elements appeared even in patients who were probably not exposed to the original story. For example, mythology offers many examples of the "dual mother" narrative, according to which a child has a biological mother and a divine mother. Therefore, argues Jung, Freudian psychoanalysis would neglect important sources for unconscious ideas, in the case of a patient with neurosis around a dual-mother image.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, ''Collected Works'' vol. 9.I (1959), "The Concept of the Collective Unconscious" (1936), ¶96–97 (pp. 46–47) "Let us now transpose Leonardo's case to the field of the neuroses, and assume that a patient with a mother complex is suffering from the delusion that the cause of his neurosis lies in his having really had two mothers. The personal interpretation would have to admit that he is right—and yet it would be quite wrong. For in reality the cause of his neurosis would like in the reactivation of the dual-mother archetype, quite regardless of whether he had one mother or two mothers, because, as we have seen, this archetype functions individually and historically without any reference to the relatively rare occurrence of dual motherhood."&lt;/ref&gt;

This divergence over the nature of the unconscious has been cited as a key aspect of Jung's famous split from [[Sigmund Freud]] and his school of [[psychoanalysis]].&lt;ref name=Williams1963&gt;Mary Williams, "The Indivisibilty of the Personal and Collective Unconscious", ''Journal of Analytical Psychology'' 8.1, January 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators have rejected Jung's characterization of Freud, observing that in texts such as ''[[Totem and Taboo]]'' (1913) Freud directly addresses the interface between the unconscious and society at large.&lt;ref name=Percival1993&gt;R. S. Percival, "Is Jung's Theory of Archetypes Compatible with Neo-Darwinism and Sociobiology?", ''Journal of Social and Evolutionary Systems'' 16.4, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Jung himself said that Freud had discovered a collective archetype, the [[Oedipus complex]], but that it "was the first archetype Freud discovered, the first and only one".&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Carr, "Jung, archetypes and mirroring in organizational change management", ''Journal of Organizational Change Management'' 15.5, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box|quote=Probably none of my empirical concepts has met with so much misunderstanding as the idea of the collective unconscious.|source=Jung, October 19, 1936&lt;ref name=ConceptOfThe /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jung, ''Collected Works'' vol. 9.I (1959), "The Concept of the Collective Unconscious" (1936), ¶87 (p. 42).&lt;/ref&gt;|width=33%}}

Jung also distinguished the collective unconscious and [[collective consciousness]], between which lay "an almost unbridgeable gulf over which the subject finds himself suspended". According to Jung, collective consciousness (meaning something along the lines of [[consensus reality]]) offered only generalizations, simplistic ideas, and the fashionable ideologies of the age. This tension between collective unconscious and collective consciousness corresponds roughly to the "everlasting cosmic tug of war between good and evil" and has worsened in the time of the [[Mass society|mass man]].&lt;ref&gt;Jung, ''Collected Works'' vol. 8 (1960), "On the Nature of the Psyche" (1947/1954), ¶423–426 (pp. 217–221).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Progoff, ''Jung's Psychology and its Social Meaning'' (1953), pp. 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Organized religion]], exemplified by the [[Catholic Church]], lies more with the collective consciousness; but, through its all-encompassing [[dogma]] it channels and molds the images which inevitably pass from the collective unconscious into the minds of people.&lt;ref&gt;Shelburne, ''Mythos and Logos'' (1988) pp. 44, 50. "Although originating through individual experiences of the collective unconscious religion is, strictly speaking, a phenomenon of collective consciousness."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jung, ''Collected Works'' vol. 9.I (1959), "The Concept of the Collective Unconscious" (1936), ¶21 (p. 12). "Dogma takes the place of the collective unconscious by formulating its contents on a grand scale. The Catholic way of life is completely unaware of psychological problems in this sense. Almost the entire life of the collective unconscious has been channeled into the dogmatic archetypal ideas and flows along like a well-controlled stream in the symbolism of creed and ritual."&lt;/ref&gt; (Conversely, religious critics including [[Martin Buber]] accused Jung of wrongly placing psychology above transcendental factors in explaining human experience.)&lt;ref&gt;Shelburne, ''Mythos and Logos'' (1988) pp. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Instincts ==
Jung's exposition of the collective unconscious builds on the classic issue in psychology and biology regarding [[nature versus nurture]]. If we accept that nature, or heredity, has some influence on the individual psyche, we must examine the question of how this influence takes hold in the real world.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, ''Collected Works'' vol. 9.I (1959), "The Concept of the Collective Unconscious" (1936), ¶92 (p. 44). "The hypothesis of the collective unconscious is, therefore, no more daring than to assume there are instincts. One admits readily that human activity is influenced to a high degree by instincts, quite apart from the rational motivations of the conscious mind. […] The question is simply this: are there or are there not unconscious universal forms of this kind? If they exist, then there is a region of the psyche which one can call the collective unconscious."&lt;/ref&gt;

On exactly one night in its entire lifetime, the [[Tegeticula yuccasella|yucca moth]] discovers pollen in the opened flowers of the yucca plant, forms some into a pellet, and then transports this pellet, with one of its eggs, to the pistil of another yucca plant. This activity cannot be "learned"; it makes more sense to describe the yucca moth as experiencing [[Intuition (mind)|intuition]] about how to act.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, ''Collected Works'' vol. 8 (1960), "Instinct and the Unconscious" (1919/1948), ¶268–269 (pp. 131–132). Note: Jung refers to ''Pronuba yucasella'', now apparently classified as ''Tegeticula yucasella''. See also: "[http://prairieecologist.com/2010/12/08/the-yucca-and-its-moth/ The Yucca and Its Moth]", ''The Prairie Ecologist'', 8 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Archetypes and instincts coexist in the collective unconscious as interdependent opposites, Jung would later clarify.&lt;ref name=Glass1974&gt;James M. Glass, "The Philosopher and the Shaman: The Political Vision as Incantation", ''Political Theory'' 2.2, May 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jung, ''Collected Works'' vol. 8 (1960), "On the Nature of the Psyche" (1947/1954), ¶406 (pp. 206–207). "Archetype and instinct are the most polar opposites imaginable, as can easily be seen when one compares a man who is ruled by his instinctual drives with a man who is seized by the spirit. But, just as between all opposites there obtains so close a bond that no position can be established or even thought of without its corresponding negation, so in this case also 'les extrêmes se touchent' [...] they subsist side by side as reflections in our own minds of the opposition that underlies all psychic energy."&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas for most animals intuitive understandings completely intertwine with instinct, in humans the archetypes have become a separate register of mental phenomena.&lt;ref name=Shelburne44to48&gt;Shelburne, ''Mythos and Logos'' (1988) pp. 44–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Humans experience five main types of [[instinct]], wrote Jung: hunger, sexuality, activity, reflection, and creativity. These instincts, listed in order of increasing abstraction, elicit and constrain human behavior, but also leave room for freedom in their implementation and especially in their interplay. Even a simple hungry feeling can lead to many different responses, including metaphorical [[sublimation (psychology)|sublimation]].&lt;ref name=Shelburne44to48 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jung, ''Collected Works'' vol. 8 (1960), "Instinct and the Unconscious" (1936/1942), ¶235–246 (pp. 115–118).&lt;/ref&gt; These instincts could be compared to the "[[Drive theory|drives]]" discussed in psychoanalysis and other domains of psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Singer, ''Culture and the Collective Unconscious'' (1968), p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Several readers of Jung have observed that in his treatment of the collective unconscious, Jung suggests an unusual mixture of primordial, "lower" forces, and spiritual, "higher" forces.&lt;ref name=Hunt&gt;Harry T. Hunt, "A collective unconscious reconsidered: Jung's archetypal imagination in the light of contemporary psychology and social science"; ''Journal of Analytical Psychology'' 57, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Archetypes  ==
In an early definition of the term, Jung writes: "Archetypes are typical modes of apprehension, and wherever we meet with uniform and regularly recurring modes of apprehension we are dealing with an archetype, no matter whether its mythological character is recognized or not."&lt;ref&gt;Jung, ''Collected Works'' vol. 8 (1960), "Instinct and the Unconscious" (1919/1948), ¶280 (pp. 137–138).&lt;/ref&gt; He traces the term back to [[Philo]], [[Irenaeus]], and the ''[[Corpus Hermeticum]]'', which associate archetypes with divinity and the creation of the world, and notes the close relationship of [[Platonic ideas]].&lt;ref&gt;Singer, ''Culture and the Collective Unconscious'' (1968), pp. 36–37. "Jung reminds us that the term 'archetype' occurs as early as Philo Judaeus, with reference to the &lt;u&gt;Imago Dei&lt;/u&gt; (God-image) in man. It can also be found in Irenaeus, who says: 'The creator of the world did not fashion these things directly from himself but copied them from archetypes outside himself. In the &lt;u&gt;Corpus Hermeticum&lt;/u&gt;, God is called 'archetypal light.'" Referring to Jung, ''Collected Works'' vol. 9.I (1959), "Psychological Aspects of the Mother Archetype" (1938/1954), ¶149 (p. 75).&lt;/ref&gt;

These archetypes dwell in a world beyond the chronology of a human lifespan, developing on an evolutionary timescale. Regarding the [[animus and anima]], the male principle within the woman and the female principle within the man, Jung writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;They evidently live and function in the deeper layers of the unconscious, especially in that phylogenetic substratum which I have called the collective unconscious. This localization explains a good deal of their strangeness: they bring into our ephemeral consciousness an unknown psychic life belonging to a remote past. It is the mind of our unknown ancestors, their way of thinking and feeling, their way of experiencing life and the world, gods and men. The existence of these archaic strata is presumably the source of man's belief in reincarnations and in memories of "previous experiences". Just as the human body is a museum, so to speak, of its phylogenetic history, so too is the psyche.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, ''Collected Works'' vol. 9.I (1959), "Conscious, Unconscious, and Individuation" (1939), ¶518 (pp. 286–287).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jung also described archetypes as imprints of momentous or frequently recurring situations in the lengthy human past.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Lu, "[http://jungiansociety.org/images/e-journal/Volume-8/Lu-2012.pdf Jung, History and His Approach to the Psyche]", ''Journal of Jungian Scholarly Studies'' [http://jungiansociety.org/index.php/publications/journals/journal-2-2011 8.9], 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

A complete list of archetypes cannot be made, nor can differences between archetypes be absolutely delineated.&lt;ref&gt;Shelburne, ''Mythos and Logos'' (1988) p. 63. "Any attempt to give an exhaustive list of the archetypes, however, would be a largely futile exercise since the archetypes tend to combine with each other and interchange qualities making it difficult to decide where one archetype stops and another begins. For example, qualities of the shadow archetype may be prominent in an archetypal image of the anima or animus. / One archetype may also appear in various distinct forms, thus raising the question whether four or five distinct archetypes should be said to be present or merely four or five forms of a single type. There would seem, then, to be no definitive decision procedure for determining the exact boundaries of an individual archetype."&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Eagle, a common archetype that may have a multiplicity of interpretations.  It could mean the soul leaving the mortal body and connecting with the heavenly spheres. Or it may mean that someone is sexually impotent, in that they have had their spiritual ego body engaged. In spite of this difficulty Jungian analyst [[June Singer]] suggests a partial list of well-studied archetypes, listed in pairs of opposites:&lt;ref&gt;Singer, ''Culture and the Collective Unconscious'' (1968), p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jung made reference to contents of this category of the unconscious psyche as being similar to Levy-Bruhl's use of ''collective representations'' or "représentations collectives," Mythological "motifs," [[Henri Hubert|Hubert]] and [[Marcel Mauss|Mauss]]'s "categories of the imagination," and [[Adolf Bastian]]'s "primordial thoughts." He also called archetypes "dominants" because of their profound influence on mental life.

== Evidence ==
In his clinical psychiatry practice, Jung identified mythological elements which seemed to recur in the minds of his patients—above and beyond the usual complexes which could be explained in terms of their personal lives.&lt;ref&gt;Singer, ''Culture and the Collective Unconscious'' (1968), pp. 37–39.&lt;/ref&gt; The most obvious patterns applied to the patient's parents: "Nobody knows better than the psychotherapist that the mythologizing of the parents is often pursued far into adulthood and is given up only with the greatest resistance."&lt;ref&gt;Jung, ''Collected Works'' vol. 9.I (1959), "Concerning the Archetypes, with Special Reference to the Anima Concept" (1936/1954), ¶137 (p. 67). Quoted in Singer, ''Culture and the Collective Unconscious'' (1968), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jung cited recurring themes as evidence of the existence of psychic elements shared among all humans. For example: "The snake-motif was certainly not an individual acquisition of the dreamer, for snake-dreams are very common even among city-dwellers who have probably never seen a real snake."&lt;ref&gt;Jung, ''Collected Works'' vol. 8 (1960), "The Structure of the Psyche" (1927/1931), ¶310 (p. 148).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ShelburnePage58 /&gt; Still better evidence, he felt, came when patients described complex images and narratives with obscure mythological parallels.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, ''Collected Works'' vol. 8 (1960), "The Structure of the Psyche" (1927/1931), ¶311 (p. 148). "A more certain proof would be possible only if we succeed in finding a case where the mythological symbolism is neither a common figure of speech nor an instance of cryptomnesia—that is to say, where the dreamer had not read, seen, or heard the motif somewhere, and then forgotten it and remembered unconsciously. This proof seems to me of great importance, since it would show that the rationally explicable unconscious, which consists of material that has been made unconscious artificially, as it were, is only a top layer, and that underneath is an absolute unconscious which has nothing to do with our personal experience."&lt;/ref&gt; Jung's leading example of this phenomenon was a paranoid-schizophrenic patient who could see the sun's dangling phallus, whose motion caused wind to blow on earth. Jung found a direct analogue of this idea in the "[[Mithras Liturgy]]", from the [[Greek Magical Papyri]] of Ancient Egypt—only just translated into German—which also discussed a phallic tube, hanging from the sun, and causing wind to blow on earth. He concluded that the patient's vision and the ancient Liturgy arose from the same source in the collective unconscious.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, ''Collected Works'' vol. 8 (1960), "The Structure of the Psyche" (1927/1931), ¶317&amp;ndash;320 (pp. 150–151). The same example appears again in "The Concept of the Collective Unconscious" (1936), ''Collected Works'' vol. 9.I (1959), ¶104–110 (pp. 50–53), but Jung adds: "I mention this case not in order to prove that the vision is an archetype but only to show you my method of procedure in the simplest possible form. If we had only such cases, the task of investigation would be relatively easy, but in reality the proof is much more complicated."&lt;/ref&gt;

Going beyond the individual mind, Jung believed that "the whole of mythology could be taken as a sort of projection of the collective unconscious". Therefore, psychologists could learn about the collective unconscious by studying [[religion]]s and [[List of religions and spiritual traditions|spiritual practices]] of all cultures, as well as belief systems like [[astrology]].&lt;ref&gt;Jung, ''Collected Works'' vol. 8 (1960), "The Structure of the Psyche" (1927/1931), ¶325 (pp. 152–153). "We can see this most clearly if we look at the heavenly constellations, whose originally chaotic forms were organized through the projection of images. This explains the influence of the stars as asserted by astrologers. These influences are nothing but unconscious, introspective perceptions of the activity of the collective unconscious. Just as the constellations were projected into the heavens, similar figures were projected into legends and fairytales or upon historical persons."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism of Jung's evidence ===

[[Karl Popper|Popperian]] critic Ray Scott Percival disputes some of Jung's examples and argues that his strongest claims are not [[falsifiable]]. Percival takes especial issue with Jung's claim that major scientific discoveries emanate from the collective unconscious and not from unpredictable or innovative work done by scientists. Percival charges Jung with excessive [[determinism]] and writes: "He could not countenance the possibility that people sometimes create ideas that cannot be predicted, even in principle." Regarding the claim that all humans exhibit certain patterns of mind, Percival argues that these common patterns could be explained by common environments (i.e. by shared nurture, not nature). Because all people have families, encounter plants and animals, and experience night and day, it should come as no surprise that they develop basic mental structures around these phenomena.&lt;ref name=Percival1993 /&gt;

This latter example has been the subject of contentious debate, and Jung critic [[Richard Noll]] has argued against its authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;See: Richard Noll, ''The Jung Cult: Origins of a Charismatic Movement'', New York: Free Press, 1997. For a synopsis of Jung and Noll: Wouter J. Hanegraaf, ''New Age Religion and Western Culture: Esotericism in the Mirror of Secular Thought'', State University of New York Press, 1998, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=xnrT97nXzgQC&amp;pg=PA505 505]–507. For a milder criticism on the same issue, from an analytic (i.e., Jungian) psychologist: George B. Hogenson, "Archetypes: emergence and the psyche's deep structure", in Joseph Cambray, Linda Carter (eds.),  ''Analytical Psychology: Contemporary Perspectives in Jungian Analysis'', New York: Brunner-Routledge, 2004, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=JZAaRpOyYa4C&amp;pg=PA42 42].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ethology and biology ===

Animals all have some innate psychological concepts which guide their mental development. The concept of [[imprinting (psychology)|imprinting]] in [[ethology]] is one well-studied example, dealing most famously with the Mother constructs of newborn animals. The many predetermined scripts for animal behavior are called [[innate releasing mechanism]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Singer, ''Culture and the Collective Unconscious'' (1968), pp. 88–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of the collective unconscious theory in neuroscience suggest that mental commonalities in humans originate especially from the subcortical area of the brain: specifically, the [[thalamus]] and [[limbic system]]. These centrally located structures link the brain to the rest of the nervous system and said to control vital processes including emotions and long-term memory .&lt;ref name=Hunt /&gt;

=== Archetype research ===

A more common experimental approach investigates the unique effects of archetypal images. An influential study of this type, by Rosen, Smith, Huston, &amp; Gonzalez in 1991, found that people could better remember symbols paired with words representing their archetypal meaning. Using data from the [[Archive for Research in Archetypal Symbolism]] and a jury of evaluators, Rosen et al. developed an "Archetypal Symbol Inventory" listing symbols and one-word connotations. Many of these connotations were obscure to laypeople. For example, a picture of a diamond represented "self"; a square represented "Earth". They found that even when subjects did not consciously associate the word with the symbol, they were better able to remember the pairing  of the symbol with its chosen word.&lt;ref&gt;D. H. Rosen, S. M. Smith, H. L. Huston, &amp; G. Gonzalez, "Empirical Study of Associations Between Symbols and Their Meanings: Evidence of Collective Unconscious (Archetypal) Memory"; ''Journal of Analytical Psychology'' 28, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Brown &amp; Hannigan replicated this result in 2013, and expanded the study slightly to include tests in English and in Spanish of people who spoke both languages.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey M. Brown &amp; Terence P. Hannigan, "[https://jber-ojs-tamiu.tdl.org/jber/index.php/jber/article/viewFile/7116/6384 An Empirical Test of Carl Jung's Collective Unconscious (Archetypal) Memory]"; ''Journal of Border Educational Research'' 5, Fall 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maloney (1999) asked people questions about their feelings to variations on images featuring the same archetype: some positive, some negative, and some non-anthropomorphic. He found that although the images did not elicit significantly different responses to questions about whether they were "interesting" or "pleasant", but did provoke highly significant differences in response to the statement: "If I were to keep this image with me forever, I would be". Maloney suggested that this question led the respondents to process the archetypal images on a deeper level, which strongly reflected their positive or negative valence.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Maloney, "Preference ratings of images representing archetypal themes: an empirical study of the concept of archetypes"; ''Journal of Analytical Psychology'' 44, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, although Jung referred to the collective unconscious as an ''empirical'' concept, based on evidence, its elusive nature does create a barrier to traditional experimental research. June Singer writes: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;But the collective unconscious lies beyond the conceptual limitations of individual human consciousness, and thus cannot possibly be encompassed by them. We cannot, therefore, make controlled experiments to prove the existence of the collective unconscious, for the psyche of man, holistically conceived, cannot be brought under laboratory conditions without doing violence to its nature. [...] In this respect, psychology may be compared to astronomy, the phenomena of which also cannot be enclosed within a controlled setting. The heavenly bodies must be observed where they exist in the natural universe, under their own conditions, rather than under conditions we might propose to set for them.&lt;ref&gt;Singer, ''Culture and the Collective Unconscious'' (1968), pp. 85–86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Exploration==
[[File:3more.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|''Moře'' (''Sea''), {{ill|Eduard Tomek|cs}}, 1971]]
Proof of the existence of a collective unconscious, and insight into its nature, could be gleaned primarily from [[dreams]] and from [[active imagination]], a waking exploration of fantasy.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, ''Collected Works'' vol. 9.I (1959), "The Concept of the Collective Unconscious" (1936), ¶100–101 (pp. 48–49).&lt;/ref&gt;

Jung considered that 'the [[Shadow (psychology)|shadow]]' and the [[anima and animus]] differ from the other archetypes in the fact that their content is more directly related to the individual's personal situation'.&lt;ref&gt;Shelburne, ''Mythos and Logos'' (1988) p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; These archetypes, a special focus of Jung's work, become autonomous personalities within an individual psyche. Jung encouraged direct conscious dialogue of the patient's with these personalities within.&lt;ref&gt;Shelburne, ''Mythos and Logos'' (1988) pp. 62–63. Discussing: Jung, ''Collected Works'' vol. 7 (1953), "The Relations Between the Ego and the Unconscious" (1916/1934), ¶321–323 (pp. 199–201). "The psyche not being a unity, but a contradictory multiplicity of complexes, the dissociation required for our dialectics with the anima is not so terribly difficult. The art of it only consists in allowing our invisible opponent to make herself heard, in putting the mechanism of expression momentarily at her disposal, without being overcome by the distaste one naturally feels at playing such an apparently ludicrous game with oneself, or by doubts as to the genuineness of the voice of one's interlocutor."&lt;/ref&gt; While the shadow usually personifies the personal unconscious, the anima or the [[Wise Old Man]] can act as representatives of the collective unconscious.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, ''Collected Works'' vol. 14 (1970), ''[[Mysterium Coniunctionis]]'' (1956), ¶128 (p. 106). "We know well enough that the unconscious appears personified: mostly it is the anima who in singular or plural form represents the collective unconscious. The personal unconscious is personified by the shadow. More rarely, the collective unconscious is personified as a Wise Old man."&lt;/ref&gt;

Jung suggested that [[parapsychology]], [[alchemy]], and [[occult]] religious ideas could contribute  understanding of the collective unconscious.&lt;ref&gt;Claire Douglas, "The historical context of analytical psychology", in Young-Eisendrath &amp; Dawson (eds.), ''Cambridge Companion to Jung'' (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Based on his interpretation of [[synchronicity]] and [[extra-sensory perception]], Jung argued that psychic activity transcended the [[brain]].&lt;ref&gt;Shelburne, ''Mythos and Logos in the Thought of Carl Jung'' (1988) pp. 15–27. Quoting Jung, ''Collected Works'', Vol. 8 (1960), "Synchronicity: An Acausal Connecting Principle" (1952), ¶947 (p. 505) : "We must completely give up the idea of the psyche's being somehow connected with the brain, and remember instead the 'meaningful' or 'intelligent' behavior of the lower organisms, which are without a brain. Here we find ourselves much closer to the formal factor [synchronicity] which, as I have said, has nothing to do with brain activity."&lt;/ref&gt; In alchemy, Jung found that plain [[water]], or [[seawater]], corresponded to his concept of the collective unconscious.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, ''Collected Works'' vol. 14 (1970), ''[[Mysterium Coniunctionis]]'' (1956), ¶372 (p. 278). "For the alchemists it was wisdom and knowledge, truth and spirit, and its source was in the inner man, though its symbol was common water or sea-water. What they evidently had in mind was a ubiquitous and all-pervading essence, an ''anima mundi'' and the 'greatest treasure,' the innermost and most secret numinosum of man. There is probably no more suitable psychological concept for this than the collective unconscious, whose nucleus and ordering 'principle' is the self (the 'monad' of the alchemists and Gnostics)."&lt;/ref&gt;

In humans, the psyche mediates between the primal force of the collective unconscious and the experience of consciousness or dream. Therefore, symbols may require interpretation before they can be understood as archetypes. Jung writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We have only to disregard the dependence of dream language on environment and substitute "eagle" for "aeroplane," "dragon" for "automobile" or "train," "snake-bite" for "injection," and so forth, in order to arrive at the more universal and more fundamental language of mythology. This give us access to the primordial images that underlie all thinking and have a considerable influence even on our scientific ideas.&lt;ref&gt;''Collected Works'' vol. 11 (1958), "Transformation Symbolism in the Mass" (1954), ¶441 (p. 289). Discussed in Shelburne, ''Mythos and Logos'' (1988) p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A single archetype can manifest in many different ways. Regarding the Mother archetype, Jung suggests that not only can it apply to mothers, grandmothers, stepmothers, mothers-in-law, and mothers in mythology, but to various concepts, places, objects, and animals:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Other symbols of the mother in a figurative sense appear in things representing the goal of our longing for redemption, such as Paradise, the Kingdom of God, the Heavenly Jerusalem. Many things arousing devotion or feelings of awe, as for instance the Church, university, city or country, heaven, earth, the woods, the sea or any still waters, matter even, the underworld and the moon, can be mother-symbols. The archetype is often associated with things and places standing for fertility and fruitfulness: the cornucopia, a ploughed field, a garden. It can be attached to a rock, a cave, a tree, a spring, a deep well, or to various vessels such as the baptismal font, or to vessel-shaped flowers like the rose or the lotus. Because of the protection it implies, the magic circle or mandala can be a form of mother archetype. Hollow objects such as ovens or cooking vessels are associated with the mother archetype, and, of course, the uterus, ''yoni'', and anything of a like shape. Added to this list there are many animals, such as the cow, hare, and helpful animals in general.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, ''Collected Works'' vol. 9.I (1959), "Psychological Aspects of the Mother Archetype" (1938/1954), ¶156 (p. 81).&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Care must be taken, however, to determine the meaning of a symbol through further investigation; one cannot simply decode a dream by assuming these meanings are constant. Archetypal explanations work best when an already-known mythological narrative can clearly help to explain the confusing experience of an individual.&lt;ref name=ShelburnePage58&gt;Shelburne, ''Mythos and Logos'' (1988) p. 58. "what may appear objectively to be a symbol may upon closer examination prove to be a sign with a simple representational explanation. In order to verify the presence of an archetype, then, both the views of introspection and extraspection are necessary. The symbolic nature of the person's experience and his for the most part absence of personal association to the material is taken into account along with the presence of the same theme or motif in material drawn from the history of symbols. The ability of these historical parallels to provide an explanation of the meaning of otherwise inexplicable content is then the crucial factor justifying the employment of the archetypal hypothesis."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application to psychotherapy ==
Psychotherapy based on analytical psychology would seek to analyze the relationship between a person's individual consciousness and the deeper common structures which underlie them. Personal experiences both activate archetypes in the mind and give them meaning and substance for individual.&lt;ref&gt;Sherry Salman, "The creative psyche: Jung's major contributions" in Young-Eisendrath &amp; Dawson (eds.), ''Cambridge Companion to Jung'' (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, archetypes covertly organize human experience and memory, their powerful effects becoming apparent only indirectly and in retrospect.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, ''Collected Works'' vol. 8 (1960), "On the Nature of the Psyche" (1947/1954), ¶440 (pp. 230–232). "Archetypes, so far as we can observe and experience them at all, manifest themselves only through their ability to ''organize'' images and ideas, and this is always an unconscious process which cannot be detected until afterwards."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Progoff, ''Jung's Psychology and its Social Meaning'' (1953), pp. 76–77. "Archetypes have a double aspect. On the one hand, they are the symbols that represent psychic processes generic to the human species. In this sense, they express universal tendencies in man. On the other hand, the psychic processes do not possess any symbolic content until they are expressed in the lives of specific historical individuals. In themselves the archetypes are only tendencies, only potentialities, and an archetype does not become meaningful until it goes out into the world and takes part in life according to its nature and according to the time in history in which it occurs."&lt;/ref&gt; Understanding the power of the collective unconscious can help an individual to navigate through life.

In the interpretation of analytical psychologist Mary Williams, a patient who understands the impact of the archetype can help to dissociate the underlying symbol from the real person who embodies the symbol for the patient. In this way, the patient no longer uncritically transfers their feelings about the archetype onto people in everyday life, and as a result can develop healthier and more personal relationships.&lt;ref name=Williams1963 /&gt;

Practitioners of analytic psychotherapy, Jung cautioned, could become so fascinated with manifestations of the collective unconscious that they facilitated their appearance at the expense of their patient's well-being.&lt;ref name=Williams1963 /&gt; [[Schizophrenic]]s, it is said, fully identify with the collective unconscious, lacking a functioning ego to help them deal with actual difficulties of life.&lt;ref&gt;Shelburne, ''Mythos and Logos'' (1988) p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application to politics and society ==
Elements from the collective unconscious can manifest among groups of people, who by definition all share a connection to these elements. Groups of people can become especially receptive to specific symbols due to the historical situation they find themselves in.&lt;ref&gt;Progoff, ''Jung's Psychology and its Social Meaning'' (1953), pp. 199–200.&lt;/ref&gt; The common importance of the collective unconscious makes people ripe for political manipulation, especially in the era of [[mass politics]].&lt;ref&gt;Jung, ''Collected Works'' vol. 9.I (1959), "The Concept of the Collective Unconscious" (1936), ¶97 (p. 47): "Today you can judge better than you could twenty years ago the nature of the forces involved. Can we not see how a whole nation is reviving an archaic symbol, yes, even archaic religious forms, and how this mass emotion is influencing and revolutionizing the life of the individual in a catastrophic manner? The man of the past is alive in us today to a degree undreamt of before the war, and in the last analysis what is the fate of great nations but a summation of the psychic changes in individuals?"  Also see: ''Collected Works'' vol. 10 (1964), "The Undiscovered Self (Present and Future)" (1957/1958).&lt;/ref&gt; Jung compared mass movements to mass psychoses, comparable to [[demonic possession]] in which people uncritically channel unconscious symbolism through the social dynamic of the [[Crowd psychology|mob]] and the [[charismatic leader|leader]].&lt;ref&gt;Progoff, ''Jung's Psychology and its Social Meaning'' (1953), pp. 205–208.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although [[civilization]] leads people to disavow their links with the mythological world of uncivilized societies, Jung argued that aspects of the primitive unconscious would nevertheless reassert themselves in the form of [[superstition]]s, everyday practices, and unquestioned traditions such as the [[Christmas tree]].&lt;ref&gt;Singer, ''Culture and the Collective Unconscious'' (1968), pp. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on empirical inquiry, Jung felt that all humans, regardless of racial and geographic differences, share the same collective pool of instincts and images, though these manifest differently due to the moulding influence of culture.&lt;ref&gt;Shelburne, ''Mythos and Logos'' (1988) pp. 32–33.&lt;/ref&gt; However, above and in addition to the primordial collective unconscious, people within a certain culture may share additional bodies of primal collective ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Singer, ''Culture and the Collective Unconscious'' (1968), pp. 134–135.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jung called the [[Ufology|UFO phenomenon]] a "living myth", a legend in the process of consolidation.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, ''Collected Works'' vol. 10 (1964), "On the Nature of the Psyche" (1947/1954), ¶614 (pp. 322–323). Discussed in Shelburne, ''Mythos and Logos'' (1988) p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Belief in a messianic encounter with UFOs demonstrated the point, Jung argued, that even if a rationalistic modern ideology repressed the images of the collective unconscious, its fundamental aspects would inevitably resurface. The circular shape of the flying saucer confirms its symbolic connection to repressed but psychically necessary ideas of divinity.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, ''Collected Works'' vol. 10 (1964), "Flying Saucers: A Modern Myth" (1958), ¶622–623 (pp. 327–328). "Anyone with the requisite historical and psychological knowledge knows that circular symbols have played an important role in every age; in our own sphere of culture, for instance, they were not only soul symbols but 'God-images.' There is an old saying that 'God is a circle whose centre is everywhere and the circumference nowhere.' God in his omniscience, omnipotence, and omnipresence is a totality symbol ''par excellence'', something round, complete, and perfect. Epiphanies of this sort are, in the tradition, often associated with fire and light. On the antique level, therefore, the Ufos could easily be conceived as 'gods.' They are impressive manifestations of totality whose simple, round form portrays the archetype of the self, which as we know from experience plays the chief role in uniting apparently irreconcilable opposites and is therefore best suited to compensate the split-mindedness of our age. It has a particularly important role to play among the other archetypes in that it is primarily the regulator and orderer of chaotic states, giving the personality the greatest possible unity and wholeness... The present world situation is calculated as never before to arouse expectations of a redeeming, supernatural event. If these expectations have not dared to show themselves in the open, this is simply because no one is deeply rooted enough in the tradition of earlier centuries to consider an intervention from heaven as a matter of course."&lt;/ref&gt;

The universal applicability of archetypes has not escaped the attention of [[marketing]] specialists, who observe that [[Promotional merchandise|branding]] can resonate with consumers through appeal to archetypes of the collective unconscious.&lt;ref&gt;Arch G. Woodside, Carol M. Megehee, &amp; Suresh Sood, "Conversations with(in) the collective unconscious by consumers, brands, and relevant others"; ''Journal of Business Research'' 65, 2012. "Jung's insights on symbolism have relevancy in understanding the likely influence of the collective unconscious on how brand logos affect behavior without awareness. For example, in a laboratory study Brasel and Gips (2011) report experimental results from a racing game involving functionally identical cars with differently branded paint jobs. The findings show that the Red Bull branding creates a U-shaped effect on race performance, as Red Bull's brand identity of speed, power, and recklessness works both for and against the players... The bull is likely to activate an aggressive, powerful, masculine storyline via the collective unconscious. So above and beyond any brand personality associations created by Red Bull's marketing efforts, the image of the bull itself conveys iconographic power and message."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tony Edwards, "Mind Over Matter: What today's account planners need to know"; ''Adweek'' 44.3, January 20, 2003. "archetype research is about identifying the emotional drivers that are common among people, from those shared by people in the same season of life to those shared across the entire species. / Identifying a match between an archetype and a brand involves discovering and defining the emotional nature of relationships between people and brands that lies in the collective unconscious."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Minimal and maximal interpretations==
In a minimalist interpretation of what would then appear as "Jung's much misunderstood idea of the collective unconscious", his idea was "simply that certain structures and predispositions of the unconscious are common to all of us...[on] an inherited, species-specific, genetic basis".&lt;ref&gt;Stan Gooch, ''Total Man'' (London 1975) p. 433.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus "one could as easily speak of the 'collective arm' – meaning the basic pattern of bones and muscles which all human arms share in common."&lt;ref&gt;Gooch, p. 433.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others point out however that "there does seem to be a basic ambiguity in Jung's various descriptions of the Collective Unconscious. Sometimes he seems to regard the predisposition to experience certain images as understandable in terms of some genetic model"&lt;ref&gt;D. A G. Cook, "Jung" in Richard L. Gregory, ''The Oxford Companion to the Mind'' (Oxford 1987) p. 405&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; as with the collective arm. However, Jung was "also at pains to stress the [[numinous]] quality of these experiences, and there can be no doubt that he was attracted to the idea that the archetypes afford evidence of some communion with some divine or world mind', and perhaps 'his popularity as a thinker derives precisely from this"&lt;ref&gt;Cook, p. 405&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; the maximal interpretation.

[[Marie-Louise von Franz]] accepted that "it is naturally very tempting to identify the hypothesis of the collective unconscious historically and regressively with the ancient idea of an all-extensive world-soul."&lt;ref&gt;Marie-Louise von Franz, ''Projection and Re-Collection in Jungian Psychology'' (1985) p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; [[New Age]] writer Sherry Healy goes further, claiming that Jung himself "dared to suggest that the human mind could link to ideas and motivations called the collective unconscious...a body of unconscious energy that lives forever."&lt;ref&gt;Sherry Healy, ''Dare to be Intuitive'' (2005) p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; This is the idea of [[monopsychism]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3033">'''Cynosarges''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Κυνόσαργες}} ''Kynosarges'') was a public [[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasium]] located just outside the walls of [[Classical Athens|Ancient Athens]]&lt;ref name=LSJ&gt;{{LSJ|*kuno/sarges|Κυνόσαργες|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the southern bank of the [[Ilissos]] river. The modern suburb of [[Kynosargous]] is named after it.

==Overview==
Its exact location is unknown but it is generally located in what is now the southern suburbs of [[Athens]].&lt;ref name=Wycherley&gt;''The Stones of Athens'', Wycherley, R.E., Princeton 1978.Pg 229&lt;/ref&gt;

Its name was a mystery to the ancients that was explained by a story about a white&lt;ref name=Wycherley /&gt; or swift dog, [[Folk etymology|etymologising]] the name as ''Kynos argos'', from [[Genitive case|genitive]] of ''kyon'' (dog) and ''argos'' (white, shining or swift). The legend goes that on one occasion when Didymos, an Athenian, was performing a lavish sacrifice, a white (or swift) dog appeared and snatched the offering; Didymos was alarmed, but received an [[oracle|oracular]] message saying that he should establish a temple to [[Heracles]] in the place where the dog dropped the offering.&lt;ref&gt;[[Suda]], κ2721, ε3160. In another account, (Suda, ει290) a white dog was being sacrificed, and an eagle stole and dropped the offering.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herodotus]] mentions a shrine there in 490/89 BC,&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]], ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Historiae]]'' 6.116&lt;/ref&gt; and it became a famous sanctuary of [[Heracles]] which was also associated with his mother [[Alcmene|Alcmena]], his wife [[Hebe (mythology)|Hebe]] and his helper [[Iolaus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'' 1.19.3.&lt;/ref&gt; A renowned gymnasium was built there;&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Themistocles'', 1; [[Stephanus of Byzantium]], ''Ethnica'' 393, 24; {{cite wikisource |title=Lives of the Eminent Philosophers |chapter=Book VI | trans_chapter=Chapter 13 |author=Diogenes Laërtius |author-link=Diogenes Laërtius |others=Translated by Robert Drew Hicks}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was meant especially for ''nothoi'', illegitimate children.&lt;ref&gt;[[Demosthenes]] 23.213; [[Athenaeus]], ''Deipnosophists'', 6.234E; [[Plutarch]], ''Themistocles'', 12&lt;/ref&gt; The Cynosarges was also where the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]] [[Antisthenes]] was said to have lectured, a fact which was offered as one explanation as to how the sect got the name of Cynics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource |title=Lives of the Eminent Philosophers |chapter=Book VI | trans_chapter=Chapter 13 |author=Diogenes Laërtius |author-link=Diogenes Laërtius |translator=Robert Drew Hicks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dakshin Bharat Jain Sabha''' ('''DBJS'''), also known as the '''South Indian Jain Association''', is a religious and social service organization of the [[Jainism|Jains]] in [[India]]. The organization is headquartered at [[Sangli]], Maharashtra, India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OmBjoAFMfjoC&amp;pg=PA368 |title=People of India: Maharashtra&amp;nbsp;— Kumar Suresh Singh |isbn=9788179911006 |author1=Singh |first1=Kumar Suresh |year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The association is credited with being one of the first Jain associations to start reform movements among the Jains in modern India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=LW8czr_HzzwC&amp;pg=PA235&amp;dq=South+Indian+Jain+Association#v=onepage&amp;q=South%20Indian%20Jain%20Association&amp;f=false |title=The Assembly of Listeners: Jains in Society&amp;nbsp;— Google Books |date= 1991-04-04|accessdate=2013-01-30|isbn=978-0-521-36505-5 |last1=Carrithers |first1=Professor of Anthropology Michael |last2=Carrithers |first2=Michael |last3=Humphrey |first3=Caroline }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JdNNz1jcN9cC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;dq=South+Indian+Jain+Association#v=onepage&amp;q=South%20Indian%20Jain%20Association&amp;f=false |title=A World Religions Reader&amp;nbsp;— Google Books |date= 2009-05-26|accessdate=2013-01-30|isbn=978-1-4051-7109-0 |last1=Markham |first1=Ian S. |last2=Lohr |first2=Christy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization mainly seeks to represent the interests of the native Jains of Maharashtra ([[Marathi Jains]]), Karnataka ([[Kannada Jains]]) and Goa.

== History ==
The organization was founded in 1899.&lt;ref name="jainsamaj1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jainsamaj.org/rpg_site/literature2.php?id=945&amp;cat=43 | title=Dakshin Bharat Jain Sabha | publisher=Jainsamaj.org | accessdate=2013-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://jainsamaj.org/rpg_site/literature2.php?id=589&amp;cat=42 | title=Conferences Inspired Reforms | publisher=Jainsamaj.org | date=1915-01-29 | accessdate=2013-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally found to represent the Jains of the southern Maratha Country of the Bombay Presidency, including Kolhapur State, Belgaum and Sangli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XubfClGnIAUC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;dq=jain+sabha+sangli#v=onepage&amp;q=jain%20sabha%20sangli&amp;f=false |title=Historical Dictionary of Jainism&amp;nbsp;— Kristi L.

'''Darius the Great's Suez Inscriptions''' were texts written in [[Old Persian]], [[Elamite]], [[Akkadian language|Babylonian]] and [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] on five monuments erected in [[Wadi Tumilat]], commemorating the opening of a canal between the [[Nile]] and the [[Bitter Lakes]].&lt;ref&gt;William Matthew Flinders Petrie, ''A History of Egypt''. Volume 3: From the XIXth to the XXXth Dynasties, Adamant Media Corporation, {{ISBN|0-543-99326-4}}, p. 366&lt;/ref&gt;

The best preserved of these monuments was a [[stele]] of [[pink granite]], which was discovered by [[Charles de Lesseps]], [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]]'s son, in 1866, 30 kilometers from [[Suez]] near [[Kabret]] in [[Egypt]]. It was erected by [[Darius the Great]], king of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] (or Persia), whose reign lasted from 522 BCE to 486 BCE. The monument, also known as the '''''Chalouf stele''''' (alt. '''Shaluf Stele'''), records the construction of a forerunner of the modern [[Suez Canal]] by the Persians, a canal through Wadi Tumilat, connecting the easternmost, [[Bubastis|Bubastite]], branch of the [[Nile]] with [[Lake Timsah]] which was connected to the [[Red Sea]] by natural waterways.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Watterson (1997), ''The Egyptians'', Blackwell Publishing, {{ISBN|0-631-21195-0}}, p.186&lt;/ref&gt; The stated purpose of the canal was the creation of a shipping connection between the Nile and the Red Sea, between [[Achaemenid Egypt|Egypt]] and Persia.

"King Darius says: I am a Persian; setting out from Persia I conquered Egypt. I ordered to dig this canal from the river that is called Nile and flows in Egypt, to the sea that begins in Persia. Therefore, when this canal had been dug as I had ordered, ships went from Egypt through this canal to Persia, as I had intended."

{{Jainism}}
'''''Digambara''''' ({{IPAc-en|d|ɪ|ˈ|g|ʌ|m|b|ər|ə}}; "sky-clad") is one of the two major [[Jain schools and branches|schools of Jainism]], the other being ''[[Śvētāmbara]]'' (white-clad). The word ''Digambara'' ([[Sanskrit]]) is a combination of two words: ''dig'' (directions) and ''ambara'' (sky), referring to those whose garments are of the element that fills the four quarters of space. ''[[Digambara monk]]s'' do not wear any clothes. The monks carry ''picchi'', a broom made up of fallen peacock feathers (for clearing the place before walking or sitting), ''[[kamandalu]]'' (a water container made of wood), and ''[[shastra]]'' (scripture).
One of the most important scholar-monks of ''Digambara'' tradition was [[Kundakunda]]. He authored [[Prakrit]] texts such as the ''[[Samayasāra]]'' and the ''[[Pravacanasāra]]''. Other prominent ''[[Acharya]]s'' of this tradition were, [[Virasena]] (author of a commentary on the ''[[Dhavala]]''), [[Samantabhadra (Jain monk)|Samantabhadra]] and [[Siddhasena Divakara]]. The ''[[Satkhandagama]]'' and ''[[Kasayapahuda]]'' have major significance in the ''Digambara'' tradition.

==History==
Relics found from [[Indus Valley civilisation|Harrapan]] excavations such as seals depicting ''[[Kayotsarga]]'' posture, idols in ''[[Lotus position|Padmasana]]'' and a nude bust of red [[limestone]], give insight into the antiquity of the ''Digambara'' tradition.{{sfn|Possehl|2002|p=111}} The presence of [[gymnosophists]] (naked philosophers) in Greek records as early as the fourth century BC, supports the claim of the ''Digambaras'' that they have preserved the ancient ''[[Śramaṇa]]'' practice.{{sfn|Zimmer|1953|p=210}}

Dundas talks about the archeological evidences which indicate that Jain monks moved from the practice of total nudity towards wearing clothes in later period. Ancient Tirthankara statues found in Mathura are naked. The oldest Tirthankara statue wearing a cloth is dated in 5th century CE.{{sfn|Upinder Singh|2016|p=444}} ''Digamabara'' statues of tirthankara belonging to Gupta period has half-closed eyes.{{sfn|Umakant Premanand Shah|1987|p=4}}

The word ''Digambara'' is a combination of two [[Sanskrit Language|Sanskrit]] words: ''dik'' (दिक्) (directions) and ''ambara'' (अम्बर) (clothes), referring to those whose garments are of the element that fills the four quarters of space.{{sfn|Zimmer|1953|p=210}} ''Digambara'' monks do not wear any clothes as it is considered to be ''parigraha'' (possession), which ultimately leads to attachment.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=45}} A ''Digambara'' monk has 28 ''mūla guņas'' (primary attributes).{{sfn|Pramansagar|2008|p=189–191}} These are: five ''mahāvratas'' (supreme vows); five ''samitis'' (regulations); ''pañcendriya nirodha'' (five-fold control of the senses); ''Ṣadāvaśyakas'' (six essential duties); and seven ''niyamas'' (rules or restrictions).{{sfn|Vijay K.

===Worship===
[[File:Tîrthankara jaina Adinatha. Cave4Badami.jpg|thumb|Adinatha image (Badami caves)]]
The ''Digambara'' Jains worship completely nude idols of ''tirthankaras'' (omniscient beings) and ''[[siddha]]'' (liberated souls). The ''tirthankara'' is represented either seated in yoga posture or standing in the ''Kayotsarga'' posture.{{sfn|Zimmer|1953|p=209–210}} 
{{quote|The truly "sky-clad" (''digambara'') Jaina statue expresses the perfect isolation of the one who has stripped off every bond. His is an absolute "abiding in itself," a strange but perfect aloofness, a nudity of chilling majesty, in its stony simplicity, rigid contours, and abstraction.{{sfn|Zimmer|1953|p=213}}|[[Heinrich Zimmer]]}}

==Literature==
The ''Digambara'' sect of Jainism rejects the authority of the texts accepted by the other major sect, the ''[[Svetambara]]s''.{{sfn|Upinder Singh|2009|p=444}}

According to the ''Digambaras'', ''Āchārya'' [[Dharasena]] guided two ''Āchāryas'', [[Pushpadanta (Jain monk)|Pushpadanta]] and [[Bhutabali]], to put the teachings of Mahavira in written form, 683 years after the ''[[Moksha (Jainism)|nirvana]]'' of Mahavira.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=79}} The two ''Āchāryas'' wrote ''[[Shatkhandagama|Ṣaṭkhaṅḍāgama]]'' on palm leaves which is considered to be among the oldest known ''Digambara'' texts.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=63–64}} ''Āchārya'' Bhutabali was the last ascetic who had partial knowledge of the original Jain ''[[Āgama (Jainism)|Agamas]]''. Later on, some learned ''Āchāryas'' started to restore, compile and put into written words the teachings of Lord Mahavira, that were the subject matter of ''Agamas''.{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2012|p=xii}}

''Digambaras'' group the texts into four literary categories called ''anuyoga'' (exposition).{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=80}} The ''prathmanuyoga'' (first exposition) contains the universal history, the ''karananuyoga'' (calculation exposition) contains works on cosmology and the ''charananuyoga'' (behaviour exposition) includes texts about proper behaviour for monks and ''Sravakas''.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=80}}

Most eminent ''Digamabara'' authors include Kundakunda, Samantabhadra, Pujyapada, Jinasena, Akalanka, Vidyanandi, Somadeva and Asadhara.{{sfn|Jaini|2000|p=28}}

==Sub-sects==
[[File:Acharya5.jpg|thumb|''[[Acharya]]'' [[Vidyasagar (Jain monk)|Vidyasagar]], a prominent [[Digambara monk]]]]
{{Jain Digambara sects}}
The ''Digambara'' tradition can be divided into two main orders viz. ''[[Mula Sangha]]'' (original community) and modern community. ''Mula Sangha'' can be further divided into orthodox and heterodox traditions. Orthodox traditions included ''Nandi'', ''Sena'', ''Simha'' and ''Deva'' ''sangha''. Heterodox traditions included ''Dravida'', ''[[Yapaniya]]'', ''[[Kashtha]]'' and ''Mathura'' sangha.{{sfn|Carrithers|Humphrey|1991|p=170}} Other traditions of ''Mula sangha'' include ''Deshiya Gana'' and ''[[Balatkara Gana]]'' traditions. Modern ''Digambara'' community is divided into various sub-sects viz. ''[[Digambara Terapanth|Terapanthi]]'', ''[[Bispanthi]]'', ''[[Taran Panth|Taranpanthi]]'' (or ''Samayiapanthi''), ''Gumanapanthi'' and ''Totapanthi''.{{sfn|Sangave|1980|pp=51-56}}

Digambara community was divided into ''Terapanthi'' and ''Bisapanthi'' on the acceptance of authority of ''Bhattaraka''.{{sfn|Long|2008|p=39}}{{Citation not found}} The ''[[Bhattaraka]]s'' of [[Shravanabelagola]] and [[Mudbidri]] belong to ''Deshiya Gana'' and the ''Bhattaraka'' of [[Humbaj]] belongs to the ''Balatkara Gana''.{{sfn|Sangave|1980|p=299}}

The  Bispanth-Terapanth division among the Digambaras emerged in the 17th century in the Jaipur region: [[Sanganer]], [[Amer, India|Amer]] and [[Jaipur]] itself.&lt;ref&gt;John E. Cort "A Tale of Two Cities: On the Origins of Digambara Sectarianism in North India." L. A. Babb, V. Joshi, and M. W. Meister (eds.), Multiple Histories: Culture and Society in the Study of Rajasthan, 39-83. Jaipur: Rawat, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Terapanthi''===
{{Main article|Digambara Terapanth}}
[[File:Acharya Gyansagar.jpg|thumb|Acharya [[Gyansagar (Chani)|Gyansagar]]]]
The ''Terapanthis'' worship what the idols represent, with ''ashta-dravya'' similarly to the Bispanthis, but replace flowers and fruits with dry substitutes.  The ashta-dravya ''jal'' (water), ''chandan'' (sandal), ''akshata'' (sacred rice), ''pushp'' (yellow rice), ''deep'' (yellow dry coconut), ''dhup'' (''kapoor'' or cloves) and ''phal'' (almonds).{{sfn|Sangave|1980|p=52}} Terapanthi is a reformist sect of ''Digambara'' Jainism that distinguished itself from the ''[[Bispanthi]]'' sect. It formed out of strong opposition to the religious domination of traditional religious leaders called ''[[bhattaraka]]s'' in the 17th century.  They oppose the worship of various minor gods and goddesses. Some ''Terapanthi'' practices, like not using flowers in worship, are followed by most of [[North India]]n Jains. ''Terapanthis'' occur in large numbers in [[Rajasthan]], [[Uttar Pradesh]] and [[Madhya Pradesh]].{{sfn|Sangave|1980|p=52}}

The Terapanthi movement was born out of the ''Adhyatma'' movement that arose in 1626 AD ([[Vikram Samvat|V.S.]] 1683) in [[Agra]]. Its leading proponent was [[Banarasidas]] of Agra.&lt;ref&gt;Ardhakathanaka: Half a tale, a Study in the Interrelationship between Autobiography and History, Mukunda Lath (trans. and ed.), Jaipur 2005. {{ISBN|978-8129105660}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better|date=March 2018}}

===''Bispanthi''===
{{Main article|Bispanthi}}
Besides ''tirthankaras'', ''Bispanthi'' also worship ''[[Yaksha]]'' and ''[[Yakshini]]'' like [[Bhairava]] and [[Kshetrapala]]. Their religious practices include ''[[aarti]]'' and offerings of flowers, fruits and ''[[prasad]]''. ''Bhattarakas'' are their ''dharma-gurus'' and they are concentrated in Rajasthan, [[Gujarat]], Maharastra and South India. {{sfn|Sangave|1980|p=52}}

== Differences with Śvētāmbara sect ==
According to ''Digambara'' texts, after attaining ''[[Kevala Jnana]]'' (omniscience), ''[[Arihant (Jainism)|arihant]]'' (omniscient beings) are free from human needs like hunger, thirst, and sleep.{{sfn|Upinder Singh|2009|p=314}} In contrast, Śvētāmbara texts preach that it is not so. According to the ''Digambara'' tradition, a soul can attain ''moksha'' (liberation) only from the male body with complete nudity being a necessity.{{sfn|Upinder Singh|2009|p=319}} While, Śvētāmbaras believe that women can attain liberation from female body itself and renunciation of clothes is not at all necessary.

[[File:Santa Sofia - Mosaic de Joan II Comnè i la seva esposa, Irene.JPG|thumb|300px|Gold sandwich glass was also used for the gold [[tesserae]] used in Late Antique, Byzantine and medieval [[mosaic]]s, as here in [[Hagia Sophia]]]]

'''Gold glass''' or '''gold sandwich glass''' is a luxury form of [[glass]] where a decorative design in [[gold leaf]] is fused between two layers of glass.  First found in [[Hellenistic Greece]], it is especially characteristic of the [[Roman glass]] of the [[Late Roman Empire|Late Empire]] in the 3rd and 4th century AD, where the gold decorated roundels of cups and other vessels were often cut out of the piece they had originally decorated and cemented to the walls of the [[catacombs of Rome]] as grave markers for the small recesses where bodies were buried.  About 500 pieces of gold glass used in this way have been recovered.&lt;ref&gt;Grig, 204-5; Lutraan, iii and 2 (note also); 8–9 Corning video&lt;/ref&gt;  Complete vessels are far rarer.  Many show religious imagery from Christianity, traditional Greco-Roman religion and its various cultic developments, and in a few examples Judaism. [[List of gold-glass portraits|Others show portraits of their owners]], and the finest are "among the most vivid portraits to survive from Early Christian times. They stare out at us with an extraordinary stern and melancholy intensity".&lt;ref&gt;Honour and Fleming, Pt 2, "The Catacombs" at illustration 7.7&lt;/ref&gt;  From the 1st century AD the technique was also used for the gold colour in [[mosaic]]s.

Various different techniques may sometimes also be described as "gold glass". [[Zwischengoldglas]] is very similar but the two layers of glass are cemented, not fused. It mostly comes from Germany and [[Bohemia]] from the 18th and 19th centuries. [[Verre églomisé]] properly covers a single layer of glass which is [[gilding|gilded]] (or coated with other types of metal leaf) on the back, as used in 19th century shop signs and the like. One process was revived by Jean-Baptise Glomy (1711–1786), hence the name. Both of these processes were also used in ancient times, and the German and French languages often use their native terms for what is called "gold glass" in English. [[Gold ruby glass]] or "cranberry glass" is actually red, coloured by the addition of [[gold(III) oxide|gold oxide]].&lt;ref&gt;See the [http://www.cmog.org/research/glass-dictionary/g#gold-glasses Corning Museum "Glass glossary"] entries for all these terms&lt;/ref&gt;  '''Gold-band glass''' is another ancient technique covered below.

==Technique==
The manufacturing process for gold glass was difficult and required great skill.  For a Late Roman glass, first a small round flat disc, typically about three to five inches across, was cut away from a [[glass-blowing|blown]] sphere with a flattened bottom, either made of coloured or plain glass.  A piece of gold leaf was then glued to this with [[gum arabic]].  The design was created by scraping away gold leaf.  The main vessel, a cup or bowl, was formed by blowing and cutting, with a flat bottom the same size as the first disc.  This was then heated again and carefully lowered onto the disc with the design, superimposing the flat bottom with the disc with the design so that they fused together.  The complete vessel was then heated a final time to complete the fusing.  Different accounts of different periods vary somewhat as to the precise sequence of stages and other details, but the process is essentially the same.&lt;ref&gt;Corning video; see also the [http://www.cmog.org/research/glass-dictionary/g#gold-glasses Corning Museum "Glass glossary"], which appears to somewhat contradict the video.&lt;/ref&gt;

The larger [[Hellenistic glass]] bowls are thought to have been formed using [[moulds]] rather than blown, as the whole bowl is doubled and the inner and outer vessels must fit together exactly.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 190&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of gold-glass portraits|Some of the finer later medallions]] seem to have been made as such from the start, and some contain pigments other than the gold.&lt;ref&gt;Example from the [[Corning Museum of Glass]] showing both features; also Gennadios and the Brescia portrait&lt;/ref&gt;  These smoother-edged medallions exploited the medium of glass as a matrix for [[portrait miniature]]s, and it has proved to be a very effective one, outlasting all alternatives except for precious metal and [[engraved gem]]s. They were probably initially made to be hung for display, or set in jewellery in smaller examples like that of Gennadios, but were also used for funerary purposes, and often use a base of blue glass.  They are a few Roman examples of vessels from Cologne of a different style where several of what have been called "sidewall blobs", small gold glass medallions about 2–3&amp;nbsp;cm across, with images, are fused into the walls of a vessel&lt;ref&gt;Grig, 204; Lutraan, 3–4 and note, now British Museum; Vickers, 612–613 has the best photos of "blobs"&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Roman - Bowl - Walters 4784 - View A.jpg|thumb|left|Roman bowl with gold band glass]]

Apart from roundels with figurative images the fused sandwich technique was used to create the [[tesserae]] for gold in [[mosaic]]s, and for beads and the like. Gold glass tesserae, at least by Byzantine times, had a very thin top layer of glass, which was probably poured onto the lower glass with the gold leaf glued to it. Tesserae were made in blocks or "cakes" and then cut into cubes, which are relatively large in the case of gold backgrounds.  Gold backgrounds were laid over earth red or [[yellow ochre]] backgrounds which enhanced their visual effect.  Most colours of tesserae seem to have been made locally to the mosaic, but there is some discussion as to whether this was true for gold glass ones.  In the 11th century the relatively new Christian centre of [[Kiev]] seems to have used gold tesserae made in [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref&gt;Cormack, 388–391; Grove, 124&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman gold glass beads were made by using an inner tube or rod to which the gold leaf was stuck.  A larger tube was slid over that and the beads crimped off.  Easily transported and very attractive, Roman gold glass beads have been found as far outside the Empire as the [[Wari-Bateshwar ruins]] in [[Bangladesh]], and sites in China, [[Korea]], [[Thailand]] and [[Malaysia]].&lt;ref&gt;Francis, 91–93&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gold-band glass''' is a related Hellenistic and Roman technique, where strips of gold leaf, sandwiched between colourless glass, are used as part of the marbling effect in [[onyx glass]].  It is mostly found in small perfume bottles and the like.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/rgld/hd_rgld.htm Trentinella, Rosemarie.

==Grave-markers==
[[File:Dougga Banquet.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Dougga]] banquet scene, 3rd century (see text)]] 
The most common form of vessel in late Roman examples was a bowl or drinking cup, which are thought to have been originally family gifts for weddings, anniversaries, New Year, the various religious festivals and the like, in some cases perhaps presented at birth or Christian baptism.&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 25; Weitzmann no. 396; Rudgers, 85&lt;/ref&gt;  None of the type of gold glass vessels cut down as grave-markers has survived complete, though about 500 of the cut-off bottoms are known,&lt;ref&gt;Grig, 204; Lutraan, iii and 2 (note also), 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; but since so many have inscriptions encouraging the owner to drink, they are usually referred to as "cups" or "glasses".  However Roman drinking cups and glasses were often very wide and shallow, though tall straight-sided or slightly flared shapes like modern [[List of glassware#Tumblers|tumblers]] are also found.  A mosaic in the North African ruins of [[Dougga]] shows two hefty slaves pouring wine from ''[[amphorae]]'' into two shallow bowls held by slaves waiting on the banquet. The two ''amphorae'' are inscribed with "ΠΙΕ" and "ΣΗϹΗϹ" the Greek originals of the toasting formulae "pie zeses" ("Drink, may you live", discussed below) so common on Roman glasses, and it has been suggested that the mosaic shows the shape a complete cup would have had.&lt;ref&gt;by Smith, see Lutraan, 75 and note 197&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:KHM Wien Zwischengoldglas Ehepaar XIa 35.jpg|thumb|300px|4th century married couple, inscribed "PIE ZESES" ("Drink, may you live")]]
[[File:Gold-glass portrait of husband and wife (Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana, Museo Sacro, Inv. no. 743).jpg|thumb|3rd-century quality portrait of a couple]]

At what was probably a much later date, perhaps after decades of use, on the death of the owner the main vessel of undecorated glass was cut away and trimmed to leave only the gold glass roundel, which was then used in the catacombs as a grave marker.  Presumably in many cases the cup had already broken in the normal course of use, and the thick bottom with the decoration had been preserved for later use in this way.  Bodies were buried in the catacombs in small recesses called ''loculi'', stacked one above another mostly along narrow corridors hollowed out from the soft rock, and no doubt some form of marker was necessary for visitors to locate the right spot.  They may also have functioned as a seal on the grave, as they were pressed into the mortar or [[stucco]] forming the final surface of the wall of the ''loculus''; other classes of small decorative objects were also used in the same way.  They may also have been regarded as capable of warding off evil spirits, especially in the later part of the period, when portraits of saints become most common.&lt;ref&gt;Rutgers, 84–85; Grig, 204–209, and throughout; Beckwith, 25; Honour and Fleming, Pt 2, "The Catacombs" at illustration 7.6; Lutraan, 4–5&lt;/ref&gt;  The very untidy trimming of many examples may be explained by this; an example in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] is still attached to a chunk of mortar round much of its edge, showing that the mortar overlapped the edge of the glass.  Rough edges would mostly have been hidden by the mortar and also provided a firmer key for the mortar to hold the glass in place (as it happens the edges of the New York piece are unusually neatly trimmed).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/collections/search-the-collections/170003396# Bowl Base with Christ Giving Martyrs’ Crowns to Saints Peter and Paul], MMA online, accn. 11.91.4; see also Lutraan, 5 and note 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Many pieces of gold glass had portraits of private individuals, mostly married couples, who may have included the deceased, while others had portraits of religious figures such as saints, or religious symbols. This custom was followed by Christian, Jewish (13 identifiably Jewish examples are known) and pagan Romans. The different sets of imagery, apart from the increased number of private portraits, are typical of the paintings also found in the catacombs and other [[Early Christian art]] and its Jewish equivalent from the period.&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 25–26; For Jewish material, Rudgers, 81–85 (13 examples on 81); Weitzmann p. 371 and numbers 347 ff.; Lutraan, 12 and throughout&lt;/ref&gt;  As Christian art developed in the late 4th and 5th centuries, its changes are reflected in the subjects and their treatment in gold glass, before the catacombs ceased to be used and the supply of examples ends.&lt;ref&gt;Weitzmann nos. 503, 507–8, 510 are late examples&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hellenistic period==
The technique was used in [[Hellenistic]] times, and Hellenistic examples are generally both more technically ambitious than Roman ones, with wide bowls or drinking cups decorated all round their curved sides in gold glass, and executed with more artistry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/130011897?rpp=20&amp;pg=1&amp;ft=%22gold+glass%22&amp;pos=1 Gold-glass skyphos (drinking cup) fragment], Metropolitan Museum of Art (23.160.76)&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[British Museum]] has a virtually complete bowl (broken but repaired) 19.3&amp;nbsp;cm wide and 11.4&amp;nbsp;cm high, one of two from a tomb in [[Canosa]] in [[Apulia]] dating to around 270–160 BC. It has most of the interior very finely decorated with [[lotus (plant)|lotus]] and [[acanthus (plant)|acanthus]] motifs, which are more typical of gold glass in this period than designs with human figures.  There are a handful of other near complete examples, and rather more fragments.  These pieces are usually assigned to [[Alexandria]] in Egypt, which is often seen as the originating centre for luxury Hellenistic glass, and is mentioned as the source of over-elaborate glass by the 1st century [[satirist]] [[Martial]] and other sources; one seems to show a [[Nile|Nilotic]] landscape, though this was a popular subject elsewhere.  However fragments have been found when excavating a glass factory on [[Rhodes]].&lt;ref&gt;Rotroff, 333&lt;/ref&gt;  A description perhaps dating from the 270s BC (surviving in the works of the later writer [[Athenaeus]]) mentions two vessels that are ''diachysa'' ("with gold in it") and very likely made by this technique.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/gr/s/sandwich_gold-glass_bowl.aspx "Sandwich gold-glass bowl"], British Museum online highlights; Williams, 190. Though textually very similar, these differ over the dating, with the book (2009) saying 210–160 BC and the website (in May 2013) 270–200 BC.

==Roman period==
[[File:Galla Placidia (rechts) und ihre Kinder.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Detail of a gold glass medallion with a portrait of a family, from [[Alexandria]] ([[Roman Egypt]]), 3rd–4th century ([[Brescia]], [[Museo di Santa Giulia]])&lt;ref name="elsner 2007 p 17 fig p 18"/&gt;]]

Gold glass mosaic tesserae begin to be used in domestic mosaics in the 1st century AD, with Rome apparently the first location. They continued to be used throughout the ancient and medieval periods into the modern day. By around 400 gold began to be used as the background colour for Christian religious mosaics, as it was throughout the Byzantine period.&lt;ref&gt;Conventi, 1–3; specifically, "[http://www.mosaicmatters.co.uk/news/news_confonbyzglass.htm the earliest known use of gold tesserae was in 55 AD, in the Gardens of Lucullus by the Spanish Steps in Rome]&lt;/ref&gt;

The decorated late Roman pieces are usually assumed to have been made in and around Rome, especially in the case of portraits of residents there, but also in the [[Rhineland]] around [[Cologne]] and [[History of Trier|Augusta Treverorum]], modern [[Trier]], which was a centre for other luxury glass products like [[cage cup]]s.  Alexandria is still thought to have been a major centre, and from linguistic analysis of the inscriptions it has been suggested that the technique, and perhaps the actual artists and craftsmen, reached Rome and Germany from there.  Yet it may just be a coincidence of survival that the other large body of "middle-class" portraiture from the period is the [[Fayum mummy portraits]] from Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 25; Hennig, 215&lt;/ref&gt;  Apart from the Rhineland finds discussed below, small numbers of cut-off vessel bases have been found in northern Italy and modern [[Hungary]] and [[Croatia]].&lt;ref&gt;Lutraan, 5&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gennadios medallion in New York, illustrated above, is a fine example of an Alexandrian portrait on blue glass, using a rather more complex technique and naturalistic style than most Roman examples, including painting onto the gold to create shading, and with the Greek inscription showing local [[dialect]] features.  He had perhaps been given or commissioned the piece to celebrate victory in a musical competition.&lt;ref&gt;Weitzmann, no. 264, entry by J.D.B.; see also no. 265; [http://www.metmuseum.org/collections/search-the-collections/170006564 Medallion with a Portrait of Gennadios], Metropolitan Museum of Art, with better image.&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the most famous Alexandrian-style portrait medallions, with an inscription in Egyptian Greek, was later mounted in an [[Early Medieval]] [[crux gemmata]] in [[Brescia]], in the mistaken belief that it showed the pious empress and [[Ostrogoths|Gothic]] queen [[Galla Placida]] (died 450) and her children;&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 338–340; Beckwith, 25&lt;/ref&gt; in fact the knot in the central figure's dress may mark a devotee of [[Isis]].&lt;ref&gt;Vickers, 611&lt;/ref&gt; The portrait in the Brescia medallion also shares clear stylistic features with the [[Fayum mummy portraits]] of [[Roman Egypt]], in addition to a Greek inscription in the [[Alexandria]]n dialect of Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;For a description of scholarly research on the Brescia Medallion, see Daniel Thomas Howells (2015). "[https://www.britishmuseum.org/pdf/Late_Antique_Gold_Glass_online.pdf A Catalogue of the Late Antique Gold Glass in the British Museum (PDF).]" London: the British Museum (Arts and Humanities Research Council), p. 7. Accessed 2 October 2016.).
&lt;br&gt;"''Other important contributions to scholarship included the publication of an extensive summary of gold glass scholarship under the entry ‘Fonds de coupes’ in Fernand Cabrol and Henri Leclercq’s comprehensive Dictionnaire d’archéologie chrétienne et de liturgie in 1923. Leclercq updated Vopel’s catalogue, recording 512 gold glasses considered to be genuine, and developed a typological series consisting of eleven iconographic subjects: biblical subjects; Christ and the saints; various legends; inscriptions; pagan deities; secular subjects; male portraits; female portraits; portraits of couples and families; animals; and Jewish symbols. In a 1926 article devoted to the brushed technique gold glass known as the Brescia medallion (Pl. 1), Fernand de Mély challenged the deeply ingrained opinion of Garrucci and Vopel that all examples of brushed technique gold glass were in fact forgeries. The following year, de Mély’s hypothesis was 
supported and further elaborated upon in two articles by different scholars. A case for the Brescia medallion’s authenticity was argued for, not on the basis of its iconographic and orthographic similarity with pieces from Rome (a key reason for Garrucci’s dismissal), but instead for its close similarity to the Fayoum mummy portraits from Egypt. Indeed, this comparison was given further credence by Walter Crum’s assertion that the Greek inscription on the medallion was written in the Alexandrian dialect of Egypt. De Mély noted that the medallion and its inscription had been reported as early as 1725, far too early for the idiosyncrasies of Graeco-Egyptian word endings to have been understood by forgers.''"
&lt;br&gt;"''Comparing the iconography of the Brescia medallion with other more closely dated objects from Egypt, Hayford Peirce then proposed that brushed technique medallions were produced in the early 3rd century, whilst de Mély himself advocated a more general 3rd-century date. With the authenticity of the medallion more firmly established, Joseph Breck was prepared to propose a late 3rd to early 4th century date for all of the brushed technique cobalt blue-backed portrait medallions, some of which also had Greek inscriptions in the Alexandrian dialect. Although considered genuine by the majority of scholars by this point, the unequivocal authenticity of these glasses was not fully established until 1941 when Gerhart Ladner discovered and published a photograph of one such medallion still in situ, where it remains to this day, impressed into the plaster sealing in an individual loculus in the Catacomb of Panfilo in Rome (Pl. 2). Shortly after in 1942, Morey used the phrase ‘brushed technique’ to categorize this gold glass type, the iconography being produced through a series of small incisions undertaken with a gem cutter’s precision and lending themselves to a chiaroscuro-like effect similar to that of a fine steel engraving simulating brush strokes.''"&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of a group of 14 pieces dating to the 3rd century AD, all individualized secular portraits of high quality.&lt;ref&gt;Grig, 207&lt;/ref&gt; Yet Jás Elsner (2007) contends that the Brescia medallion, likely depicting a family from Alexandria since the inscription is in the [[Greeks in Egypt|Alexandrian dialect of Greek]], has a range of possible dates ranging from the early-3rd to mid-5th century AD, before it found its way to Italy where it adorned a 7th-century [[Christian cross]].&lt;ref name="elsner 2007 p 17 fig p 18"&gt;Jás Elsner (2007).

It is thought that the tiny detail of pieces such as these can only have been achieved using [[lens (optics)|lens]]es.&lt;ref&gt;Sines and Sakellarakis, 194–195&lt;/ref&gt;  Where the refined "Alexandrian" medallions, wherever they were actually produced, mostly have a simple thin gold line framing the subject, the Roman examples have a variety of heavier frames, often using two round borders, the style of which forms part of efforts to group them by workshop.&lt;ref&gt;Rutgers, 83&lt;/ref&gt;  The level of portraiture is rudimentary, with features, hairstyles and clothes all following stereotypical styles.&lt;ref&gt;Grig, 207; Lutraan, 29–45 goes into considerable detail&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:KHM Wien Zwischengoldglas Heilige XIa 37.jpg|thumb|300px|Two Christian saints, 4th century]]

An "Alexander plate with hunting scene" in the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] is, if genuine,&lt;ref&gt;Presumably the piece described by Vickers (p. 610) as "widely suspected to be a modern forgery"&lt;/ref&gt; a very rare example of a complete vessel decorated with gold glass, and comes from the upper elite of Roman society.  It is a shallow bowl or plate 25.7&amp;nbsp;cm (10 1/8 inches) in diameter and 4.5&amp;nbsp;cm (1 3/4 inches) high. The decorated flat roundel in the centre takes about two thirds of the whole diameter. It shows a mounted huntsman with a spear pursuing two [[elk]], while beneath his horse a huntsman on foot with a hound on a leash confronts a [[wild boar]]. The Latin inscription "{{lang|la|ALEXANDER HOMO FELIX PIE ZESES CUM TUIS}}" means "Alexander fortunate man, drink, may you live, together with yours".  The identity of "Alexander" has been the subject of discussion, but he is on the whole though to be an unknown aristocrat rather than [[Alexander the Great]] or the Emperor [[Alexander Severus]] (reigned 232–235). The dish is perhaps slightly later than his reign and at least during his reign he could never be addressed as merely a "man".&lt;ref&gt;Weitzmann, no. 79, entry by R.B., which translates the inscription "Alexander, fortunate man, may you live [long] with your family and friends in affection" – a more literal version is given here; [http://www.clevelandart.org/art/1969.68?collection_search_query=Gold+glass&amp;year_operator=1&amp;year=400&amp;year_era=1&amp;year_end=&amp;year_end_era=1&amp;op=search&amp;form_build_id=form-1kMpg1FTVNs9NMt11E5m_8sn7Wqte6vJABKNb5yRWiE&amp;form_id=clevelandart_collection_search_form Cleveland Museum of Art], online collection image. The object was not on display in May 2013. It was intact in about 1900 but broken in 1968, then repaired. The image from Cleveland show large areas of the undecorated glass missing, that are present in Weitzmann's black-and-white photo.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Greek drinking toast ZHCAIC given in Latin letters as ZESES, meaning "live!" or "may you live", is a very common part of inscriptions on gold glass,&lt;ref&gt;Weitzmann nos. 388, and 347–348 etc; Lutraan, 53&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes the only inscription.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/collections/search-the-collections/170003564 Bowl Base with Miracle Scenes], Metropolitan Museum of Art (16.174.2)&lt;/ref&gt;  It is more common than the Latin equivalent VIVAS, probably because it was considered more refined, somewhat like the modern "bon appétit" used in English.  Two glasses including images of Jesus "misspell" "ZESES" as "ZESUS", managing to achieve wordplay between a drinking toast and the name of the Christian saviour.&lt;ref&gt;Lutraan, 55–56&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Gladiator in gold glass.jpg|thumb|left|Gladiator in gold glass]]

Such secular "blessings" are typical, and on roundels made from cups they often urge the owner to drink, even when the [[iconography]] is religious.  One Jewish example has the usual array of symbols and the inscription "Drink, [so] you may live, Elares".  The [[Wedding at Cana]] is a popular Christian subject, with one example inscribed "Worthy of your friends, may you live in the peace of God, drink".&lt;ref&gt;Weitzmann nos. 347 and 396 respectively&lt;/ref&gt;  Another popular phrase is DIGNITAS AMICORUM or "[you are] the honour of your friends".&lt;ref&gt;Lutraan, 57–58&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of inscriptions are made up of either names or such conventional expressions, or the two combined.  An example inscribed "DIGNITAS AMICORVM PIE ZESES VIVAS" typifies the tendency to pile together the common phrases.&lt;ref&gt;Lutraan, 60–61&lt;/ref&gt;  The convivial dedications found on so many examples are paralleled by several of the far more luxurious [[cage cup]]s or ''diatreta''.

One round bottom from a larger bowl found in the catacombs is 10.8&amp;nbsp;cm across, and now in the [[Ashmolean Museum]] in [[Oxford]].  It has five abbreviated scenes from the Old and New Testaments surrounding a married couple in a roundel, with the feet of the outer figures to the centre.&lt;ref&gt;Newby, 24–25 (with photo); Vickers, 610–611&lt;/ref&gt;  A large and complex bowl from Cologne was decorated all over with Christian scenes and Imperial portraits, but presumably because of its size (height 8.6, diameter 11.4&amp;nbsp;cm) no second layer of glass was fused on, so the gold has now all been lost, though the shapes of the design can be seen.  The portraits of the sons of [[Constantine I]] allow an unusually precise probable dating to 326, his ''[[vicennalia]]'', or the 25th anniversary of his reign.&lt;ref&gt;Weitzmann nos. 377. Made, found and still in Cologne, now [[Römisch-Germanisches Museum]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Another complete piece is a [[paten]] from the [[Basilica of St. Severin, Cologne]], founded in the 4th century.  This is decorated with roundels containing [[Old Testament]] scenes and floral motifs. According to the ''[[Liber Pontificalis]]'', [[Pope Zephyrinus]], in office from 199–217, had approved the use of glass patens, and ones in other glass techniques survive.&lt;ref&gt;Milburn, 270&lt;/ref&gt;  A variant technique is only known from vessels from Cologne with what have been called "sidewall blobs", where small gold glass medallions with images are fused into the walls of a vessel; one of the few examples was found in the cemetery of St Severin.&lt;ref&gt;Grig, 204; Lutraan, 3–4 and note, now British Museum&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography of the vessel bottoms==
[[File:Gold glass Christian plate, 4th century.jpg|thumb|300px|left|[[Saint Peter]], [[Virgin Mary]] in [[orant]] pose, [[Saint Paul]], 4th century]]
Almost all the Roman vessel bottoms have imagery of some sort, and around 240 have legible inscriptions as well. Of these, about half of the total number of gold glasses known,&lt;ref&gt;As catalogued by Lutraan; most of this section uses her for quantitative statements&lt;/ref&gt; portraits are most common, but there are small narrative scenes, mainly Christian but a few pagan.  Portraits of Christian sacred figures are on about half the full corpus.&lt;ref&gt;Grig, 215&lt;/ref&gt; There are a small number of depictions of sports, animals, wreaths and the like, and a single example with a central image of a plant.  No Imperial portraits are recorded, nor military scenes; unlike so much Roman public art the glasses concentrate on the private interests of individuals.  Apart from a single near-naked [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] and some figures of [[Erotes (mythology)|erotes]],&lt;ref&gt;Lutraan, 25–26&lt;/ref&gt; sexual themes are another notable absence compared to much Roman art.  Most glasses feature a single image occupying most of the round space within the border, but some have a number of small scenes, usually arranged in small circular frames around a central image. Most portraits are between bust and half-length.&lt;ref&gt;Lutraan, Chapter 2; Milburn, 270–272&lt;/ref&gt;  The small number of glasses with Jewish iconography are covered separately below.

Either portraits or inscriptions naming private individuals are very common, though other examples have no personalizing aspect and were perhaps just bought from a dealer's stock.&lt;ref&gt;Lutraan, 29–31&lt;/ref&gt;  Portraits of married couples are at first most the common, but saints were more numerous towards the end of the period; the two are also often combined.&lt;ref&gt;Grig, reported by Lutraan, 11, 14, 17&lt;/ref&gt;  It is not always possible to distinguish the two confidently, despite ''[[titulus (inscription)|tituli]]'' inscriptions and a convention of using contemporary dress for owners and a conventional out of date costume for sacred figures, even recent male ones such as [[Pope Damasus I]] (r. 366–384). Damasus, exceptionally for a contemporary cleric, appears on at least four glasses, or at least it is thought he is who "DAMAS" refers to.&lt;ref&gt;"DAMAS" on 4 glasses per Grig, 5 per Lutraan; Grig, 208–215 and ff.; Lutraan, 31–32 and pages following, page 39 on female sacred figures who dress in more contemporary styles.&lt;/ref&gt;

Saints Peter and Paul together are very common, usually facing each other in profile, but sometimes with other figures.  Both were martyred in Rome, and especially popular there;&lt;ref&gt;Lutraan, 40–42; Milburn, 270–272; Grig, 216–217&lt;/ref&gt; other local martyrs such as [[Saint Agnes|Agnes]] are depicted several times,&lt;ref&gt;Lutraan, 44–45, Grig, 220–221&lt;/ref&gt; and according to Lucy Grig "the ''Roman-ness'' of the saints portrayed on the Roman glasses is striking", and five popes from the 3rd and 4th centuries are probably depicted.&lt;ref&gt;Grig, 215–216, 215 quoted, 219–220 on popes&lt;/ref&gt;  Christ is shown in a number of examples, usually as clean-shaven and youthful, as well as figures such as the [[Good Shepherd]] which may symbolize him, or in some cases [[Orpheus]] or general [[bucolic]] imagery.  A small Christ may stand between the heads of a married couple, blessing them.&lt;ref&gt;Lutraan, 42–44&lt;/ref&gt; [[Orant]]s perhaps representing the soul of an owner when not identified as a saint, and as in the catacombs always shown as female, appear a number of times, and female saints and the Virgin are always shown in the orant pose.&lt;ref&gt;Lutraan, 44–45; Grig, 220–221&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Gold glass Resurrection of Lazarus, 4th century.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Christian ''[[Raising of Lazarus]]'', 4th century]]

Narrative scenes from the Old Testament are more common than miracles of Christ, as in the catacomb paintings, and the same "abbreviated representations" of scenes of deliverance feature: the story of [[Jonah]], [[Daniel in the lions' den]], the three youths in the [[Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego|Fiery Furnace]].&lt;ref&gt;Lutraan, 21–23&lt;/ref&gt;  The most common scenes in later Christian art, centred around the liturgical calendar, are very rare.  There are really only two non-Christian narrative scenes: one labour of Hercules (two more are shown in "sidewall blobs"), and one of [[Achilles]], but a number of "portrait" figures, as with Christian sacred figures often combined with owners.&lt;ref&gt;Lutraan, 20–21&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a small number of "agonistic" or sporting scenes, with wrestlers, boxers, one gladiator, and several racing chariot teams.  Several of these, like others seeming to represent victory in a musical or dramatic context, feature palms and crowns and may well have been presented to celebrate victory in these fields in some amateur or professional setting, like the Alexandrian Gennadios portrait.  Two identical glasses featuring two boxers with a trainer, all named, suggest that the glasses may sometimes have been ordered in sets; one may speculate that this may have been common.&lt;ref&gt;Lutraan, 24–25&lt;/ref&gt;  Single examples show [[Athena]] presiding over shipbuilders, a pair of personifications of Rome and Constantinople, and female figures representing the ''[[monetae]]'' or mints, which are often shown on coins. A number have animals that may carry symbolic meaning, or objects such as scrolls or wreaths.&lt;ref&gt;Lutraan, 26–28&lt;/ref&gt;

The short inscriptions tend to be similar regardless of the content of the image, with names and the "convivial formulae" described above together or separately predominating. A religious implication (as may be intended in ''vivas'' or ''zeses'' for example) is relatively rarely explicitly stated.&lt;ref&gt;Lutraan's chapter 3 analyses these, and chapter 4 discusses relations between the images and their accompanying inscriptions.&lt;/ref&gt;  The names are in the single ''[[cognomen]]'' form which is hard to relate to such records as survive,&lt;ref&gt;Lutraan, 62&lt;/ref&gt; but three glasses can possibly be related to known individuals who were potential owners, and one to a family (that of the poet [[Ausonius]]).&lt;ref&gt;Lutraan, 67–69&lt;/ref&gt;  These persons are rather grand, and one might think belonged to the classes buried in [[sarcophagi]] rather than ''loculi''; the glasses perhaps belonged to ''"amici"'', clients or dependents, or had passed as gifts or legacies by the subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Grig, 211–212&lt;/ref&gt;  One glass in the British Museum is unusual in a number of respects: between a named couple is a smaller figure of Hercules, and the inscription: "ORFITVS ET CONSTANTIA IN NOMINE HERCVLlS ACERENTINO FELICES BIBATIS" or "Orfitus and Constantia, may you live/drink in happiness in the name of Hercules of Acerentia".  This may well represent Memmius Vitruvius Orfitus, prefect of Rome, and his wife. [[Acerenthia|Acerentia]] in southern Italy had a local cult of Hercules.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/g/gold-glass_medallion_showing_h.aspx "Gold-glass medallion showing Herakles"]; Lutraan, 67–70&lt;/ref&gt;  For some historians Orfitus was "notorious as the propaganda mastermind of the 'pagan revival'" of his day.&lt;ref&gt;Grig, 208&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jewish glasses==
[[File:2nd century Rome gold goblet shows Jewish ritual objects.jpg|thumb|300px|Jewish ritual objects, Rome, 2nd century AD]]

Only 13 of the more than 500 known Late Roman vessel bottoms are identifiably Jewish, but these have still been said to represent "the most appealing group of Jewish realia that have come down from antiquity".&lt;ref&gt;Rutgers, 81. What Rudgers' figure includes is not absolutely clear (for example glasses with non-Jewish imagery found in Jewish catacombs).&lt;/ref&gt;  They are all presumed to have been used in the Roman catacombs as grave-markers, though as with the examples identifiable with other religions, the exact [[find spot]] and context of the great majority is unrecorded.  Rather surprisingly, the only two of the 13 with full histories were found in Christian catacombs, whereas the only gold glass remains found in Jewish catacombs have no Jewish iconography,&lt;ref&gt;Rutgers, 82; Grig, 228&lt;/ref&gt;  and show that "some Jews felt no qualm in using gold glasses with pagan iconographical motifs".&lt;ref&gt;Rutgers, 85; Elsner's article casts doubt on the whole notion of separate arts for Jews and Christians in the period&lt;/ref&gt;

Identifiably Jewish roundels do not feature portraits but with one exception have a fairly standard array of religious symbols.  The most common arrangement is on two levels, with two [[Lion of Judah|Lions of Judah]] flanking a [[Torah ark]] above, and below two [[menorah (Temple)|menarot]], a [[shofar]] (rams horn), [[etrog]], [[lulav]] and perhaps others of the [[four Species]], scrolls and vases.  Not all the tiny symbols can be confidently identified.&lt;ref&gt;Weitzmann nos. 347–348; Rutgers, 82. One finely painted example in the [[Israel Museum]] mentioned by Rutgers, 83 and with an image at the external link at the end of the article has two birds flanking the Torah ark and the lions with a single Menorah below.&lt;/ref&gt;  Alternatively, the objects are all in the top tier, above a banqueting scene.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/collections/search-the-collections/170005829 Bowl Fragments with Menorah, Shofar, and Torah Ark], Metropolitan Museum of Art (18.145.1a, b), also in Weitzmann as no. 348; for another variant on this theme in the Vatican, see Elsner, 115–116&lt;/ref&gt;  The single exception to such compositions has what is thought to be a representation of the [[Temple of Jerusalem]], perhaps representing the feat of [[Purim]].&lt;ref&gt;Rutgers, 82–83&lt;/ref&gt;

Most scholars are confident that Jewish customers used the same workshops as those of the other religions, who presumably kept patterns for designs for all religions, or were provided with sketches.  Some of the attempts to group glasses by workshop attribute Jewish glasses and those of other religions to the same workshop.  Apart from the use of symbols rather than human figures, the Jewish glasses seem to have been used in very much the same way as those from other religious groups, which is also characteristic of other classes of Jewish artefacts from Rome at this time, where the Jewish community adopted many aspects of the general Roman way of life.  Of the 13 known, five have inscriptions including the phrase "''pie zeses''" (see above) and two "''anima dulcis''" (literally "sweet soul", equating to "sweetheart"), both very common phrases in Christian and pagan inscriptions. The rarer phrase "''vivas cum ...''" ("live with ...") is also found on Jewish and non-Jewish glasses.  They would seem to have been given as gifts on the same sort of occasions, and there is evidence that Roman Jews shared the general Roman custom of New Year present-giving.&lt;ref&gt;Rutgers, 83–85, and more generally for shared artistic and cultural practices: 81, 85, 88 and throughout; Grig, 205 and note; Elsner, throughout&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later uses and collections==

[[File:Gold-glass portrait of two young men (Bologna).jpg|thumb|4th-century portrait, now in [[Bologna]]]]
The technique continued to be used for mosaic tesserae, and at times for pieces that remained relatively large, for example in a small tile in New York with a pattern forming a cross, perhaps from a [[Syria]]n church of the 9th to 12th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/170008121?rpp=20&amp;pg=1&amp;ft=%22gold+glass%22&amp;pos=10 Metropolitan Museum of Art (46.174)]&lt;/ref&gt;  A small group of Islamic vessels are decorated with mostly simplified vegetal motifs and probably date to the 10th century from [[Syria]]; the most complete ones are decorated over a large curved area and must have been made by using a "double vessel" method.  In both respects these are closer to the Hellenistic vessels than most Roman ones.&lt;ref&gt;Wenzel, summary on p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

From at least the 17th century the Roman glasses attracted [[antiquarian]] interest and they began to be removed from the catacombs, in a largely disorganized and unrecorded fashion; now only a "handful" remain in their original position in the catacomb walls.&lt;ref&gt;Lutraan, 4&lt;/ref&gt;   The first significant publication on them was by [[Filippo Buonarroti]] in 1716, ''Osservazioni sopra alcuni frammenti di vasi antichi di vetro ornate di figure trovati nei cimiteri di Roma'' ("Observations on some fragments of antique glass vases decorated with figures, found in the cemeteries of Rome"), in which he made the extraordinary, almost [[Romanticism|proto-Romantic]] assertion that the aesthetic crudity of early Christian art, often remarked by connoisseurs of Roman arts, had served to intensify the piety of the worshipper, an early expression of feeling for [[primitive art]].&lt;ref&gt;Rudoes, 307 and note; [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/19539 James Hall, "Michelangelo and the Etruscans", ''New York Review of Books'' '''53'''.17 · 2 November 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;  After other studies, the Italian [[Jesuit]] [[Raffaele Garrucci]] published the first illustrated survey in 1858, with an expanded second edition in 1864.&lt;ref&gt;Rudoes, 307&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 19th century a number of imitations, copies and downright forgeries of Roman pieces were made, mostly in [[Murano]] off [[Venice]], by firms such as [[Salviati (glassmakers)|Salviati]].&lt;ref&gt;Rudoes, throughout; for example, no. 1043 in the catalogue of ''Roman Glass in the Corning Museum of Glass: volume three, Part 2'', ed. David B. Whitehouse, 2004, Hudson Hills, {{ISBN|0872901556}}, 9780872901551, [https://books.google.com/books?id=bBBkBJN_lJMC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;dq=Roman+gold+glass&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XIGKUbePI5Ko0AXW2YCwBA&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Roman%20gold%20glass&amp;f=false google books]; [https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/projects/gold_glass_in_late_antiquity.aspx Gold glass in late antiquity: the British Museum collection]&lt;/ref&gt;  The first major public exhibition of these seems to have been at the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|Exposition Universelle of 1878]] in Paris, by Italian firms.&lt;ref&gt;Rudoes, 305&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of museums around the world have examples of Roman vessel bottoms.&lt;ref&gt;Apart from the Vatican, a blurb for Morey's catalogue mentions collections in: "Ostia Antica, Arezzo, Parma, Brescia, Turin, Catania, Florence, Bologna, Verona, Pesaro, Naples, London, Oxford, Barcelona, Tel-Aviv, Paris, Cologne, Bonn, Frankfurt, Wurzburg, Munich, Vienna and New York". (Abebooks)&lt;/ref&gt; The largest collection is in the [[Vatican Museums]], with the 60 pieces of Late Antique glass in the British Museum the second largest.  A research project on their collection was due to finish in 2010 (see further reading below).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/projects/gold_glass_in_late_antiquity.aspx Gold glass in late antiquity: the British Museum collection]; see External links for many photos of the Vatican's collection&lt;/ref&gt;  The Wilshere Collection in the Ashmolean is the third largest, with some 34 pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Vickers describes the whole collection, on loan to the museum from [[Pusey House]] until bought in 2007. The glass is described at 609–613&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Corning Museum of Glass]] has 18 examples and the Metropolitan Museum in New York nearly as many.  The most recent of many catalogues since the 18th century are by C.R. Morey in 1959, with 460 Roman vessel bases, against 426 in S. Smith's thesis of 2000. The corpus continues to be expanded by occasional new finds.&lt;ref&gt;Lutraan, 7–10&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Guru Jambeshwar''', also known as '''Guru Jambhoji''', (1451-1536) was the founder of the [[Bishnoi]] sect. He preached the worship of [[Vishnu]], the all mighty god. He taught that God is a divine power that is everywhere. He also taught to protect plants and animals as they are important in order to peacefully coexist with nature.

==Biography==
Jambheshwar was born in a [[Rajput]] family of the Panwar clan in the village of Pipasar in 1451.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?q=guru+jambaleshwar+rajput&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1#q=Jambhoji+(1451-1536+A.D.)+was+born+in+an+affluent+Panwar+Rajput+family+which+could+conveniently+trace+its+&amp;tbm=bks Jambhoji: Messiah of the Thar Desert - Page xiii]&lt;/ref&gt; He was the only child of Lohat Panwar and Hansa Devi. For the first seven years of his life, Jambheshwar bhagwan was considered silent and introverted. He spent 27 years of his life as a cow herder.{{cn |date=January 2018}}

Aged 34, Jambheshwar ji founded the Bishnoi sect. His teachings were in the poetic form known as Shabadwani.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dharma and Ecology of Hindu Communities: Sustenance and Sustainability |first=Pankaj |last=Jain |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-40940-591-7 |publisher=Routledge |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VYcGDAAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{pn|date=September 2017}} He preached for the next 51 years, travelling across the country, and produced 120 Shabads, or verses, of Shabadwani.{{cn|date=September 2017}} The sect was founded after wars between Muslim invaders and local Hindus. He had laid down 29 principles to be followed by the sect - ''bish'' means ''twenty'' and ''noi'' means ''nine''. Killing animals and felling trees were banned. The [[Prosopis cineraria|khejri]] tree (''Prosopis cineraria''), is also considered to be sacred by the Bishnois.

Bishnoism revolves around [https://bishnoisamachar.in/29-rules-of-bishnoi 29 rules]. Of these, eight prescribe to preserve [[biodiversity]] and encourage good [[animal husbandry]], seven provide directions for healthy social behaviour, and ten are directed towards personal hygiene and maintaining basic good health.

Hinduism is a minor religion in [[Hungary]].

==International Society for Krishna Consciousness==
The International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) runs the Bhaktivedanta Theological College in Hungary. The Hungarian government donated a building for the Bhaktivedanta Theological College.

Krishna devotees first appeared in Hungary at the end of the 1970s, but only in the second wave of the mission, in the mid 1980s, did a viable community develop.

===Hare Krishnas in Hungary===
The leaders of ISKCON mention 8,000-12,000 devotees living in Hungary.
According to [[Tamas Barabas]] (one of the leaders of the ISKCON), 190-200 live in temples, 700-900 practice their religion seriously, on the four festivals 9,000-10,000 persons gave their names, many of whom go to different Krishna programmes. Amongst them, the number of followers and non-followers, regular and less-regular practitioners is unknown.&lt;br /&gt;
The biggest ISKCON centre in Hungary is the rural community located in Somogyvamos, a small village in south-western Hungary.

Krishna Valley is the ISKCON farm in [[Somogyvámos]] village in Hungary.It is  660-acre sustainable farm area which attracts thousands of tourists every year.&lt;ref&gt;https://iskconnews.org/hungarys-krishna-valley-celebrates-twenty-years,3896&lt;/ref&gt; At the moment, Krishna-valley has 150 inhabitants, and there are an additional 30,000 people yearly who visit there or participate at religious festivals.There ia also an Eco-School in Krishna-valley.&lt;ref&gt;https://iskconnews.org/new-eco-school-inaugurated-in-krishna-valley-hungary,5587&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal Status==
Since 1989 the Community of the Hungarian Krishna conscious devotees (from now on ISKCON) is a registered religion in Hungary. At their incorporation they registered 50 persons.

The Parliament resolved that Hare Krishnas, Jehovah's Witnesses, The Hungarian Church of Scientology and the Unification Church being 'destructive sects', would not get government support.

In March 1994, the Parliament voted for governmental support of ISKCON and, by this, they withdrew the judgement of ISKCON as 'destructive' and recognised its religious life and charitable work.

In 2011,Hungary's new "Law on the Right to Freedom of Conscience and Religion, and on Churches, Religions and Religious Communities" was enacted and it recognized only 14 religious groups&lt;ref&gt;https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_902032&lt;/ref&gt; and 
Hinduism lost its official status.&lt;ref&gt;https://iskconnews.org/dozens-of-small-churches-in-hungary-fear-loss-of-status-due-to-new-politicized-law-on-religion,3017&lt;/ref&gt; International Hindu organizations in Europe including [[Hindu Forum of Europe]],[[Hindu American Seva Charities]],[[Hindu Forum of Britain]], [[Hindu American Foundation]] have expressed their concern about the issue at the Hungarian Embassies in their respective countries, as well as by sending letters directly to Prime Minister [[Viktor Orbán]].&lt;ref&gt;https://cerfi.wordpress.com/tag/jura-nanuk/page/3/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://iskconnews.org/iskcon-retains-its-religious-status-in-hungary,3148&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012,this law was amended and expand the list of officially recognized churches from 14 to a total of 32,&lt;ref&gt;https://news.adventist.org/en/all-news/news/go/2012-02-28/in-hungary-amended-religion-law-recognizes-seventh-day-adventist-church/&lt;/ref&gt; which included Hungarian Society for Krishna Consciousness as a fully recognized churches in Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;https://iskconnews.org/iskcon-retains-its-religious-status-in-hungary,3148&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bahá'í history''' is often traced through a sequence of leaders, beginning with the [[Báb]]'s declaration in [[Shiraz]] on the evening of May 22, 1844, and ultimately resting on an Administrative Order established by the central figures of the religion.  The religion had its background in two earlier movements in the nineteenth century, [[Shaykhism]] and [[Bábism]].&lt;ref name="iranica_bahai"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|authorlink= Denis MacEoin |encyclopedia= Encyclopædia Iranica |year= 1989 |article=Baha'i Faith | first = Dennis | last = MacEoin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shaykhism centred on theosophical doctrines and many Shaykhis expected the return of the hidden [[Twelfth Imam]].  Many Shaykhis joined the messianic Bábí movement in the 1840s where the [[Báb]] proclaimed himself to be the return of the hidden Imam. As the Bábí movement spread in [[Iran]], violence broke out between the ruling [[Shia Islam|Shi'a Muslim]] government and the Bábís, and ebbed when government troops massacred them, and executed the Báb in 1850.&lt;ref name="iranica_bahai"/&gt;

The Báb had spoken of another messianic figure, [[He whom God shall make manifest]].  As one of the followers of the Báb, Bahá'u'lláh was imprisoned during a subsequent wave of massacre by the Persian government against Bábís in 1852, was exiled to Iraq, and then to [[Constantinople]] and [[Adrianople]] in the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref name="iranica_bahai"/&gt;  Amidst these banishments, in 1863 in Baghdad, Bahá'u'lláh claimed to be the messianic figure expected by the Báb's writings. Bahá'ís consider the [[Bahá'í Faith|Baha'i religion]] to start from Bahá'u'lláh's statements in 1863.

At the time of Bahá'u'lláh's death the tradition was mostly confined to the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] empires, at which time he had followers in thirteen countries of Asia and Africa.&lt;ref name="rob2"&gt;{{Cite book |last = Taherzadeh |first = A. |authorlink= Adib Taherzadeh |year = 1977 |title = The Revelation of Bahá'u'lláh, Volume 2: Adrianople 1863-68  |publisher = George Ronald  |place = Oxford, UK  |isbn = 0-85398-071-3  |url = http://www.peyman.info/cl/Baha%27i/Others/ROB/V2/p107-136Ch05.html#p125 |page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leadership of the religion then passed on to [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], Bahá'u'lláh's son, who was appointed by Bahá'u'lláh, and was accepted by almost all Bahá'ís.&lt;ref name="iranica_bahai"/&gt; Under the leadership of `Abdu'l-Bahá, the religion gained a footing in Europe and America, and was consolidated in Iran, where it still suffers intense [[Persecution of Bahá'ís|persecution]].&lt;ref name="affolter"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Affolter |first=Friedrich W. |date=January 2005 |title=The Specter of Ideological Genocide: The Bahá'ís of Iran |journal=War Crimes, Genocide, &amp; Crimes against Humanity |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=75–114 |url=http://www.altoona.psu.edu/journals/war-crimes/articles/V1/v1n1a3.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-04-20 |doi= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722083412/http://www.altoona.psu.edu/journals/war-crimes/articles/V1/v1n1a3.pdf |archivedate=2012-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of `Abdu'l-Bahá in 1921, the leadership of the Bahá'í community was passed on to his grandson, [[Shoghi Effendi]], who  was appointed in `Abdu'l-Bahá's [[Will and Testament of `Abdu'l-Bahá|will]]. The document appointed [[Shoghi Effendi]] as the first [[Guardian (Bahá'í Faith)|Guardian]], and called for the election of the [[Universal House of Justice]] once the Bahá'í Faith had spread sufficiently for such elections to be meaningful. During Shoghi Effendi's time as leader of the religion there was a great increase in the number of Baha'is, and he presided over the election of many [[National Spiritual Assemblies]].&lt;ref name="iranica_bahai"/&gt;

Shoghi Effendi died in 1957, and because he was childless he had found it impossible to appoint another Guardian after himself to succeed him.  In 1963 the [[Universal House of Justice]] was elected. Since 1963 the Universal House of Justice has been elected every five years and remains the successor and leading institution of the religion.&lt;ref name="iranica_bahai"/&gt; See [[Bahá'í Faith by country]] for further information per country.

==Shaykhi movement==
{{main|Shaykhism}}
In [[Islam]], the [[Mahdi]] is a messianic figure who is believed to be a descendant of [[Muhammad]] who will return near the end of time to restore the world and the religion of God.&lt;ref name="EoR_Mahdi"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Aghaie | first = Kamran Scott | editor = Ed. Lindsay Jones | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Religion | title = Messianism: Messianism in the Muslim Tradition | edition = 2nd | year = 2005 | publisher = Macmillan Reference USA | volume = 2 | location = Detroit | isbn = 0-02-865733-0 | pages = 5979–5983}}&lt;/ref&gt; While both [[Sunni]] and [[Shi'a]] groups believe in the Mahdi, the largest Shi'a group, the [[Twelvers]], believe that the Mahdi is the Twelfth Imam, [[Muhammad al-Mahdi]], who is believed to have gone into occultation since 874 CE.&lt;ref name="EoR_Mahdi"/&gt;

In the Twelver view the Twelfth Imam first went into a "''Minor Occultation''" between 874 and 941 CE where the Hidden Imam still communicated with the community through four official intermediaries.  The "''Greater Occultation''" is then defined from the time when the Hidden Imam ceased to communicate regularly until the time when he returns to restore the world.&lt;ref name="iranica_gayba"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia= Encyclopædia Iranica |year= 1989 |article=GÚAYBA | first = Said Amir | last = Arjomand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shaykh Ahmad al-Ahsá'í===
{{main|Shaykh Ahmad}}
The Shaykhi movement was a school of theology within Twelver Shi'a Islam that was started through the teaching of Shaykh Ahmad al-Ahsá'í.  Shaykh Ahmad's teachings included that the Imams were spiritual beings and thus, in contrast to the widespread Shi'a belief, that the Imams existed within spiritual bodies, and not material bodies.&lt;ref name="EoR_Shayki"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last = Scholl | first = Steven |author2=Rizvi, Sajjad H. | editor = Ed. Lindsay Jones | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Religion | title = Shaykhīyah | edition = 2nd | year = 2005 | publisher = Macmillan Reference USA | volume = 2 | location = Detroit | isbn = 0-02-865733-0 | pages = 8307–8309}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also taught that there must always exist the "Perfect Shi'a" who serves as an intermediary between the Imams and the believers, and is the one who can visualize the consciousness of the Hidden Imam.&lt;ref name="EoR_Shayki" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RaR_54"&gt;{{cite book | last = Amanat | first = Abbas | title = Resurrection and Renewal: The Making of the Babi Movement in Iran, 1844-1850 | publisher = Kalimat Press | year = 2005 | isbn = 1-890688-42-8 | page = 54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1822 he left Iran and went to Iraq due to the controversy that his teachings had brought.  There he also found himself at the centre of debate, thus deciding to move to [[Mecca]], he died in 1826 on his way there.&lt;ref name="EoR_Shayki" /&gt;

===Siyyid Kázim-i-Rashtí===
{{main|Siyyid Kázim}}
Before the death of Shaykh Ahmad, he appointed Siyyid Kázim of Rasht to lead the Shaykhí movement, which he did until his death in 1843. Siyyid Kázim formulated many of the thoughts that were ambiguously expressed by Shaykh Ahmad including the doctrine of salvation history and the cycles of revelation.&lt;ref name="EoR_Shayki" /&gt;  His teaching brought a sense of millenarian hope among the Shaykhis that the Hidden Imam may return.&lt;ref name="EoR_Shayki" /&gt; Siyyid Kazim did not leave a successor, but before his death in December, 1843, he had counselled his followers to leave their homes to seek the Mahdi, who according to his prophecies would soon appear.&lt;ref name="EoR_Shayki" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EoI"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Islam | year = 1999 | article = Bāb | publisher = Koninklijke Brill NV | location = Leiden, The Netherlands | first = A.| last = Bausani}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Báb==
{{main|Báb}}
[[File:TerracesBenGurion2.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Shrine of the Báb in [[Haifa]], [[Israel]]]]
Siyyid `Alí-Muhammad, who later took on the title the [[Báb]], was born on October 20, 1819, in [[Shiraz, Iran|Shiraz]] to a [[merchant]] of the city; his father died while he was quite young and the boy was raised by his maternal uncle [[Hájí Mirzá Siyyid 'Ali|Ḥájí Mírzá Siyyid `Alí]], who was also a merchant.&lt;ref name="EoI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="balyuzi"&gt;{{cite book |last = Balyuzi |first = H.M. |authorlink = Hasan M.

In May 1844 the Báb proclaimed to [[Mulla Husayn]], one of the Shaykhis, to be the one whose coming was prophesied by Shaykh Ahmad and Siyyid Kázim and the bearer of divine knowledge.&lt;ref name="iranica_bab"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia= Encyclopædia Iranica |year= 1989 |article=Bāb, Sayyed `Ali Mohammad Sirazi | first = Dennis | last = MacEoin}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Within five months, seventeen other disciples of Siyyid Káẓim had recognized the Báb as a Manifestation of God.&lt;ref name="BBCHistory"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/bahai/history/bab_1.shtml|  title = The Time of the Báb |publisher = [[BBC]] | accessdate = 2010-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EoA"&gt;{{cite book | chapter = Resurgence of Apocalyptic in Modern Islam | first = Abbas | last = Amanat | editor = Stein, Stephen J. | title = The Encyclopedia of Apocalypticism, vol.

His followers were known as Bábís.

The first accounts in the West of events related to the history of the Báb and his followers appears January 8, 1845 as an exchange of diplomatic reports not published in the newspapers.&lt;ref name=momen1981&gt;{{cite book|author=Moojan Momen|title=The Bábí and Bahá'í religions 1844-1944: some contemporary western accounts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1S4KAQAAMAAJ||year=1981| origyear = 1977|publisher=G. Ronald|isbn=978-0-85398-102-2|pages = xv, xvi, 4, 11, 26–38, 62–5, 83–90, 100–104}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was an account of the first Letter of the Living to be dispatched from the presence of the Báb - the second Letter of the Living and first Babi martyr, [[Letters of the Living#Mull.C3.A1 .60Al.C3.AD Bast.CC.A3.C3.A1m.C3.AD|Mullá `Alí-i-Bastámí]]. The British diplomat who recorded these events was [[Sir Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baronet]] who wrote first to [[Stratford Canning, 1st Viscount Stratford de Redcliffe]], then Ambassador to Istanbul, and it included an enclosure from the Governor of Kirmánsháh protesting the arrest in Ottoman lands of a Persian mullá. Followup exchanges continued from January into April where diplomatic records of events end. Ottoman state archives affirm his arrival in Istanbul where he is then sentenced to serve in the naval ship yards at hard labor - the Ottoman ruler refusing to banishment him as it would be "difficult to control his activities and prevent him spreading his false ideas."&lt;ref name=momen1981/&gt; The first public account was published Nov 1, 1845 in the ''[[London Times]]''.&lt;ref name=momen1981/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cadwalader&gt;{{cite journal| last = Cadwalader | first =Robert | title ="Persia": An Early Mention of the Báb | journal =World Order | volume =11 | issue =2 | pages = 30–34 | publisher =National Assembly of the Bahá'ís of the United States | date =1977 | url =https://bahai.works/index.php?title=File:World_Order2_Vol11_Issue2.pdf&amp;page=32  | access-date = Apr 5, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was centered on events in Shiraz when the last Letter of the Living, [[Quddús]] returned after traveling with the Báb.&lt;ref name=momen1981/&gt; The story was also carried from Nov 15 by the [[Literary Gazette]]&lt;ref name=momen1981/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cadwalader/&gt; which was subsequently echoed widely in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =https://bahai-library.com/first_newspaper_accounts_babism  | title =First newspaper story of the events of the Bábí Faith  | author= Steven Kolins | date =2013 |orig-year= 1845 | website =Bahai-Library.com | access-date =Apr 5, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After some time, preaching by the Letters of the Living led to opposition by the Islamic clergy, prompting the Governor of Shiraz to order the Báb's arrest. After being house arrest in Shiraz from June 1845 to September 1846,&lt;ref name="iranica_bab" /&gt; the Báb spent several months in [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]] debating clergy, many who became sympathetic.&lt;ref&gt;Amanat, ''Resurrection and Renewal,'' 257.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was then ordered by the Shah to Tehran in January 1847; after spending several months in a camp outside Tehran, the Prime Minister sent the Báb to [[Tabriz]] in the northwestern corner of the country, where he was confined.&lt;ref name="iranica_bab" /&gt;

He was then transferred to the fortress of [[Maku, Iran|Máh-Kú]] in the province of [[Iranian Azarbaijan|Azarbaijan]] close to the Turkish border. During his incarceration there, the Báb began his most important work, the [[Persian Bayán]], which he never finished. He was then transferred to the fortress of [[Chihríq]] in April 1848.&lt;ref name="EoI" /&gt; In that place as well, the Báb's popularity grew and his jailors relaxed restrictions on him. Hence the Prime Minister ordered the Báb back to Tabriz where the government called on religious authorities to put the Báb on trial for blasphemy and apostasy.&lt;ref name="iranica_bab" /&gt; [[Bábism]] was also spreading across the country, and the Islamic government saw it as a threat to state religion and several military confrontations took place between government and Bábí forces.

| page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; ordered the execution of the Báb, probably because various Bábí insurrections had been defeated and the movement's popularity appeared to be waning. The Báb was brought back to Tabríz from Chihríq, so that he could be shot by a [[Execution by firing squad|firing squad]]. On the morning of July 9, 1850, the Báb was taken to the courtyard of the barracks in which he was being held, where thousands of people had gathered to watch. The Báb and a companion were suspended on a wall and a large firing squad prepared to shoot.&lt;ref name="iranica_bab" /&gt; After the order was given to shoot and the smoke cleared, the Báb was no longer in the courtyard and his companion stood there unharmed; the bullets apparently had not harmed either man, but had cut the rope suspending them from the wall.&lt;ref&gt;Numerous eye-witness reports, including those of Western diplomats, recount the result. Sir Justin Shiel, [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]'s Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary in Tehran, wrote to [[Henry Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]], the British Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, on July 22, 1850 regarding the execution. The [[Execution of the Báb#Western accounts|letter]], can be found in its original form as document F.O. 60/152/88 in the archives of the Foreign Office at the Public Records Office in London.&lt;/ref&gt; The soldiers subsequently found the Báb in another part of the barracks, completely unharmed. He was tied up for execution a second time, a second firing squad was ranged in front of them, and a second order to fire was given. This time, the Báb and his companion were killed.&lt;ref name="iranica_bab" /&gt; Their remains were dumped outside the gates of the town to be eaten by animals.

The remains, however, were rescued by a handful of Bábis and were hidden.  Over time the remains were secretly transported by way of Isfahan, Kirmansháh, [[Baghdad]] and [[Damascus]], to [[Beirut]] and thence by sea to [[Acre, Israel]] on the plain below [[Mount Carmel]] in 1899.&lt;ref name="gpb_18"&gt;{{cite book |first=Effendi |last=Shoghi |authorlink=Shoghi Effendi |year=1944 |title=God Passes By |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn=0-87743-020-9 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/GPB/gpb-19.html | pages=273–289}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1909, the remains were then interred in a special [[Shrine of the Báb|tomb]], erected for this purpose by [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], on Mount Carmel in the Bahá'í Holy Land in [[Haifa|Haifa, Israel]] and remains an important place of [[Bahá'í pilgrimage|pilgrimage]] for Bahá'ís. The Bahá'í Shrine in Haifa, Israel, is a protected site.

While the Báb claimed a station of revelation, he also claimed no finality for his revelation.&lt;ref name="browne"&gt;{{cite book | url = http://bahai-library.com/browne_babism | title =  Bábism | first = Edward G. | last = Browne | authorlink = E.G. Browne | year = 1889}}&lt;/ref&gt; A constant theme in his works, especially the Persian Bayan was that of the great Promised One, the next embodiment of the Primal Will, whom the Báb termed [[He whom God shall make manifest]], promised in the sacred writings of previous religions would soon establish the Kingdom of God on the Earth.&lt;ref name="iranica_bab" /&gt;&lt;ref name="farah"&gt;{{cite book | title = Islam: Beliefs and Observances | first = Caesar E. |last= Farah |location= Woodbury, NY | publisher= Barron's Educational Series |year = 1970 | url = http://bahai-library.com/farah_islam_beliefs_observances}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the books written by the Báb he constantly entreats his believers to follow He whom God shall make manifest when he arrives.&lt;ref name="browne" /&gt;

Before his death, the Báb had been in correspondence with two brothers, [[Bahá'u'lláh]] and [[Subh-i-Azal]] who, after the death of many prominent disciples, emerged as the mostly likely leaders.&lt;ref name="iranica_bahaullah"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia= Encyclopædia Iranica |year= 1989 |article=Baha'-allah | url = http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/baha-allah | first = Juan | last = Cole}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a letter sent to Subh-i-Azal, then aged around nineteen, the Báb appears to have indicated a high station or leadership position.&lt;ref name="iranica_bahaullah" /&gt;  The letter also orders Subh-i-Azal to obey the Promised One when he appears;&lt;ref name="Manuchehri (2004)"&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Research Notes in Shaykhi, Babi and Baha'i Studies | volume = 7 | issue = 2 |date=September 2004 | title = The Primal Point’s Will and Testament | first = Sepehr | last = Manuchehri | url = http://www.h-net.msu.edu/~bahai/notes/vol7/BABWILL.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; in practise, Subh-i-Azal, however, seems to have had little widespread legitimacy and authority.&lt;ref name="iranica_bahaullah" /&gt; Bahá'u'lláh in the meantime, while in private hinted at his own high station, in public kept his messianic secret from most and supported Subh-i-Azal in the interest of unity.&lt;ref name="iranica_bahaullah" /&gt; In 1863 in [[Baghdad]], he made his first public declaration and eventually was recognized by the vast majority of Bábís as "He whom God shall make manifest" and his followers began calling themselves [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]].&lt;ref name="cole_bahabio"&gt;{{cite web | title = A Brief Biography of Baha'u'llah | last = Cole| first = Juan| accessdate=2006-06-22 | url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jrcole/bahabio.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bahá'u'lláh==
{{main|Bahá'u'lláh}}
Bahá'u'lláh was born on November 12, 1817, in [[Tehran]]. Bahá'u'lláh's father was entitled [[Mírzá `Abbás Núrí|Mírzá Buzurg]] while he served as [[vizier]] to Imám-Virdi Mírzá, the twelfth son of [[Fat′h Ali Shah Qajar]]. Mírzá Buzurg was later appointed governor of [[Borujerd|Burujird]] and [[Lorestan]],&lt;ref name = "Balyuzi" &gt;{{cite book |first=Hasan |last=Balyuzi |year=2000 |title=Bahá'u'lláh, King of Glory }}&lt;/ref&gt; a position that he was stripped of during a government purge when [[Mohammad Shah Qajar|Muhammad Shah]] came to power. After his father died, Bahá'u'lláh was asked to take a government post by the new vizier Haji Mirza Aqasi, but he declined the position.&lt;ref name="cole_bahabio" /&gt;

At the age of 28, Bahá'u'lláh received a messenger, [[Mullá Husayn]], telling him of the [[Báb]], whose message he accepted, becoming a Bábí. Bahá'u'lláh began to spread the new cause, especially in his native province of Núr, becoming recognized as one of its most influential believers.&lt;ref name="iranica_bahaullah" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Balyuzi" /&gt; The accompanying government suppression of the Báb's religion resulted in Bahá'u'lláh's being imprisoned twice and enduring [[bastinado]] torture once&lt;ref name = "Balyuzi" /&gt; Bahá'u'lláh also attended the [[Conference of Badasht]], where 81 prominent Babis met for 22 days; at that conference where there was a discussion between those Babis who wanted to maintain Islamic law and those who believed that the Báb's message began a new dispenation, Bahá'u'lláh took the pro-change side, which eventually won out.&lt;ref name="iranica_bahaullah" /&gt;

In 1852, two years after the execution of the Báb, the Bábís were polarized with one group speaking of violent retribution against the Shah, [[Nasser-al-Din Shah]] while the other, under the leadership of Baha’u’llah, looked to rebuild relationships with the government and advance the Babí cause by persuasion and the example of virtuous living.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media

Their meetings appear to have come under the control of a "Husayn Jan", an emotive and magnetic figure who obtained a high degree of personal devotion to himself from the group.

Bahá'u'lláh met briefly with a couple of the radical Babi leaders and learned of an assassination plan. He condemned the plan, but was soon asked to leave Tehran by the authorities.&lt;ref name="Religio 12-1"/&gt; In the vacuum of leadership&lt;ref name="Religio 12-1"/&gt; on August 15, 1852 about 3 Babis&lt;ref name="Religio 12-1"/&gt; attempted the assassination of the Shah and failed.&lt;ref name="iranica_bahaullah" /&gt; Notwithstanding the assassins' claim that they were working alone, the entire Bábí community was blamed, and a slaughter of several thousand Bábís followed. Amidst the general violence some Bábís were imprisoned in the [[Síyáh-Chál]] (Black Pit), an underground dungeon of Tehran.&lt;ref name="eor"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| last = Hutter | first = Manfred | editor = Ed.

[[File:Map iran ottoman empire banishment.png|thumb|right|300px|Map of Bahá'u'lláh's banishments]]
The government later found Bahá'u'lláh innocent of complicity in the assassination plot, and he was released from the Síyáh-Chál, but the government exiled him from Iran.  Bahá'u'lláh chose to go to Iraq in the [[Ottoman Empire]] and arrived in [[Baghdad]] in early 1853.&lt;ref name="iranica_bahaullah" /&gt;  A small number of Babis, including his half-brother Subh-i-Azal, followed Bahá'u'lláh to Baghdad.  An increasing number of Bábís considered Baghdad the new centre for leadership of the Bábí religion, and a flow of [[pilgrim]]s started coming there from Persia. In Baghdad people began to look to Subh-i-Azal for leadership less and less due to his policy of remaining hidden, and instead saw Bahá'u'lláh as their leader.&lt;ref name="iranica_bahaullah" /&gt;&lt;ref name="deepen"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Bijan | last = Ma'sumian | title = Baha'u'llah's Seclusion in Kurdistan |volume = 1 | pages = 18–26 | journal = Deepen Magazine| date = Fall 1993 | url = http://bahai-library.com/masumian_bahaullah_kurdistan | issue = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subh-i-Azal started to try to discredit Bahá'u'lláh and further divided the community.&lt;ref name="deepen" /&gt; The actions of Subh-i-Azal drove many people away from the religion and allowed its enemies to continue their persecution.&lt;ref name="cole_bahabio" /&gt;

On April 10, 1854 Bahá'u'lláh left Baghdad in order to distance himself from Subh-i-Azal and as to avoid becoming the source of disagreement within the Babi community; he left with one companion to the mountains of [[Kurdistan]], north-east of Baghdad, near the city [[Sulaymaniyah]].&lt;ref name="cole_bahabio" /&gt; For two years Bahá'u'lláh lived alone in the mountains of Kurdistan&lt;ref name="eor" /&gt; living the life of a [[Sufi]] [[dervish]].&lt;ref name="iranica_bahaullah" /&gt; At one point someone noticed his remarkable penmanship, which brought the curiosity of the instructors of the local [[Sufism|Sufi]] orders.&lt;ref name="cole_bahabio" /&gt; During his time in Kurdistan he wrote many notable books including the [[Four Valleys (Bahá'í)|Four Valleys]].&lt;ref name="eor" /&gt; In Baghdad, given the lack of firm and public leadership by Subh-i-Azal, the Babi community had fallen into disarray.&lt;ref name="cole_bahabio" /&gt; Some Babis, including Bahá'u'lláh's family, thus searched for Bahá'u'lláh, and pleaded with him to come back to Baghdad, which he did in 1856.&lt;ref name="iranica_bahaullah" /&gt;

Bahá'u'lláh remained in Baghdád for seven more years. During this time, while keeping his perceived station as the [[Manifestation of God]] hidden, he taught the Báb's teachings.  He published many books and verses including the [[Kitáb-i-Íqán|Book of Certitude]] and the [[Hidden Words]].&lt;ref name="iranica_bahaullah" /&gt; Bahá'u'lláh's gatherings attracted many notables, both locals and Iranian pilgrims, giving him greater influence in Baghdad and in Iran.  His rising influence in the city, and the revival of the Persian Bábí community gained the attention of his enemies in [[Islamic]] clergy and the [[Qajar dynasty|Persian government]].&lt;ref name="iranica_bahaullah" /&gt;&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | year = 1988 | title = The Bahá'í Faith | encyclopedia = Britannica Book of the Year | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica | location = Chicago | isbn = 0-85229-486-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They were eventually successful in having the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman government]] call Bahá'u'lláh from Baghdad to [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref name="britannica" /&gt;

Before he left Baghdad on the way to Constantinople, Bahá'u'lláh camped for twelve days in the [[Garden of Ridván, Baghdad|Garden of Ridván]] near Baghdad starting on April 22, 1863.  During his stay in the garden a large number of friends came to see him before he left. It was during his time in the Garden of Ridván that Bahá'u'lláh declared to his companions his perceived mission and station as a Messenger of God.&lt;ref name="eor" /&gt; Today Bahá'ís celebrate the twelve days that Bahá'u'lláh was in the Garden of Ridván as the festival of [[Ridván]].

After travelling for four-month over land, Bahá'u'lláh arrived in the capital of the Ottoman Empire, [[Constantinople]] (now [[Istanbul]]). Although not a formal prisoner yet, the forced exile from [[Baghdad]] was the beginning of a long process which would gradually move him into further exiles and eventually the penal colony of Akká, Ottomon Empire's Palestine (now [[Acre, Israel]]). Bahá'u'lláh and [[Bahá'u'lláh's family|his family]], along with a small group of [[Bábí]]s, stayed in Constantinople for only four months. Due to his refusal to build alliances with the Ottoman politicians, Bahá'u'lláh had no means of resisting pressure from the Iranian ambassador to exile him further away, and Sultan [[Abdülâziz]] banished Bahá'u'lláh to [[Adrianople]] (current-day [[Edirne]]), which was a site for the exile of political prisoners.&lt;ref name="iranica_bahaullah" /&gt;

[[File:Early Bahais-1.jpg|thumb|left|320px|`Abdu'l-Bahá in Adrianople with his brothers and companions of Bahá'u'lláh.]]
During the month of December 1863, Bahá'u'lláh and [[Bahá'u'lláh's family|his family]] embarked on a twelve-day journey to [[Edirne|Adrianople]].  Bahá'u'lláh stayed in Adrianople for four and a half years. In Adrianople Bahá'u'lláh made his claim to be [[Him whom God shall make manifest]] more public through letters and [[Tablet (religious)|tablets]].&lt;ref name="iranica_bahaullah" /&gt; Bahá'u'lláh's assertion as an independent Manifestation of God made Subh-i-Azal's leadership position irrelevant; Subh-i-Azal, upon hearing Bahá'u'lláh's words in a tablet read to him, challenging him to accept Bahá'u'lláh's revelation, refused and challenged Bahá'u'lláh to a test of divine will at a local mosque, but he lost face when he did not appear.&lt;ref name="iranica_bahaullah" /&gt; This caused a break within the Bábí community, and the followers of Bahá'u'lláh became known as [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]], while the followers of Subh-i-Azal became known as [[Azalis]].

Starting in 1866, while in Adrianople, Bahá'u'lláh started writing a series of letters to world rulers, proclaiming his station as the promised one of all religions.&lt;ref name="iranica_bahaullah" /&gt;  His letters also asked them to renounce their material possessions, work together to settle disputes, and endeavour towards the betterment of the world and its peoples. Some of these leaders written to in the coming years include Pope [[Pope Pius IX|Pius IX]], [[Napoleon III of France]], Czar [[Alexander II of Russia]], [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] of Great Britain and Ireland, [[Nasser al-Din Shah|Násiri’d-Dín Sháh]] of the Persian Empire and the rulers of [[Americas|America]].&lt;ref name="iranica_bahaullah" /&gt;

[[File:Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh.jpg|thumb|280px|[[Shrine of Bahá'u'lláh]]]]
The disagreements between the Bahá'ís and the Azalís allowed the Ottoman and Persian authorities to exile Bahá'u'lláh once again.  Bahá'u'lláh and his family left Adrianople on August 12, 1868 and after a journey by land and sea arrived in [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] on August 31.  The first years in Acre imposed very harsh conditions on, and held very trying times for, Bahá'u'lláh. [[Mirzá Mihdí]], Bahá'u'lláh's son, was suddenly killed at the age of twenty-two when he fell through a skylight while pacing back and forth in prayer and [[meditation]]. After some time, the people and officials began to trust and respect Bahá'u'lláh, and thus the conditions of the imprisonment were eased and eventually, after [[Ottoman Sultan `Abdu'l-`Aziz|Sultan `Abdu'l-`Aziz]]'s death, he was allowed to leave the city and visit nearby places.

From 1877 until 1879 Bahá'u'lláh lived in the house of [[Bahá'í World Centre buildings#Mazra.27ih|Mazra'ih]].&lt;ref name="iranica_bahaullah" /&gt;

The final years of Bahá'u'lláh's life were spent in the [[Mansion of Bahjí]], just outside Acre, even though he was still formally a prisoner of the Ottoman Empire. During his years in Acre and Bahjí, Bahá'u'lláh produced many volumes of work including the [[Kitáb-i-Aqdas]].&lt;ref name="iranica_bahaullah" /&gt; On May 9, 1892 Bahá'u'lláh contracted a slight fever which grew steadily over the following days, abated, and then finally took his life on May 29, 1892. He was buried in a [[Shrine of Bahá'u'lláh|Shrine]] located next to the Mansion of Bahjí in Israel. During his lifetime, communities of Bahá'ís were established in [[Bahá'í Faith in Armenia|Armenia]], [[Bahá'í Faith in Myanmar|Burma]], [[Bahá'í Faith in Egypt|Egypt]], [[Bahá'í Faith in Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Bahá'í Faith in India|India]], [[Bahá'í Faith in Lebanon|Lebanon]], (what is now) [[Bahá'í Faith in Pakistan|Pakistan]], [[Bahá'í Faith in Sudan|Sudan]], [[Bahá'í Faith in Syria|Syria]], [[Bahá'í Faith in Turkey|Turkey]], and [[Bahá'í Faith in Turkmenistan|Turkmenistan]].&lt;ref name="stats"/&gt;

==`Abdu'l-Bahá==
{{main|`Abdu'l-Bahá}}
{{see also|Covenant of Bahá'u'lláh#Lesser Covenant}}
Bahá'u'lláh was succeeded by his eldest son, `Abdu'l-Bahá. Designated as the "Center of the Covenant" and Head of the Faith, Bahá'u'lláh designated him in his will as the sole authoritative interpreter of Bahá'u'lláh's writings. [http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/TB/tb-16.html#gr1]

`Abdu'l-Bahá had shared his father's long exile and imprisonment. This imprisonment continued until `Abdu'l-Bahá's own release as a result of the "[[Young Turk]]" revolution in 1908. The remains of the Báb were buried on March 21, 1909 in a six-room mausoleum made of local stone.

Following his release he led a life of [[`Abdu'l-Bahá's journeys to the West|travelling]] and speaking especially 1910–1913, and maintaining correspondence with communities of believers and individuals, expounding the principles of the Bahá'í Faith. `Abdu'l-Bahá died in [[Haifa]] on November 28, 1921 and is now [[Shrine of `Abdu'l-Bahá|buried in one of the front rooms]] in the Shrine of the Báb, in Haifa, Israel. During his lifetime communities of Bahá'ís formed in [[Bahá'í Faith in Australia|Australia]], [[Bahá'í Faith in Austria|Austria]], [[Bahá'í Faith in Brazil|Brazil]], [[Bahá'í Faith in Canada|Canada]], [[Bahá'í Faith in China|China]], [[Bahá'í Faith in the United Kingdom|the United Kingdom]], [[Bahá'í Faith in France|France]], [[Bahá'í Faith in Germany|Germany]], the [[Bahá'í Faith in the Netherlands|Netherlands]], [[Bahá'í Faith in Hungary|Hungary]], [[Bahá'í Faith in Italy|Italy]], [[Bahá'í Faith in Japan|Japan]], [[Bahá'í Faith in Jordan|Jordan]] [[Bahá'í Faith in Russia|Russia]], [[Bahá'í Faith in South Africa|South Africa]], [[Bahá'í Faith in Switzerland|Switzerland]], [[Bahá'í Faith in Tunisia|Tunisia]], and [[Bahá'í Faith in the United States of America|the United States of America]].&lt;ref name="stats"/&gt;

In this document `Abdu'l-Bahá established the institutions of the appointed Guardianship and the elected [[Universal House of Justice]]. In that same document he appointed his eldest grandson, [[Shoghi Effendi]], as the first Guardian of the Bahá'í Faith.

Shoghi Effendi throughout his lifetime translated the sacred writings of the Faith; developed global plans for the expansion of the Bahá'í community; developed the [[Bahá'í World Centre]]; carried on a voluminous correspondence with communities and individuals around the world; and built the administrative structure of the Faith, preparing the community for the election of the Universal House of Justice.

With the unexpected passing of [[Shoghi Effendi]] in 1957, the faith was left without a clear candidate for Guardian. The Hands of the Cause, appointed by Shoghi Effendi, took the necessary administrative roles at the Bahá'í World Centre, and organized the election of the [[Universal House of Justice]], from which they excluded themselves from membership. By the time of the election of the Universal House of Justice, Bahá'í communities had been established in many of the countries of the world.&lt;ref name="stats"/&gt; Seventy nations had organized their communities to elect National Spiritual Assemblies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Hassall | first = Graham | title = Notes on Research on National Spiritual Assemblies | work = Research notes | publisher = Asia Pacific Bahá'í Studies | url =http://bahai-library.com/hassall_nsas_years_formation  | doi =| accessdate = 2008-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the election of the [[Universal House of Justice]] in 1963, it then ruled that given the unique situation and the provisions of the [[Will and Testament of `Abdu'l-Bahá]], it was not possible to appoint another Guardian. The Universal House of Justice today remains the supreme governing body of the Bahá'í Faith, and its nine members are elected every five years. As recently as 2001 the number of countries with organized communities electing National Spiritual Assemblies was 182.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.wanadoo.nl/arjen.nandita2/bahai-world-statistics-2001.htm Baha'i World Statistics 2001] by Baha'i World Center Department of Statistics, 2001-08&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bahai-library.com/danesh_life_shoghi_effendi The Life of Shoghi Effendi] by Helen Danesh, John Danesh and Amelia Danesh, Studying the Writings of Shoghi Effendi, edited by M.

The '''''Ikhernofret Stela''''' ([[Egyptian Museum of Berlin|Berlin Museum]] ref 1204) is an important [[Ancient Egyptian]] [[stela]] dated to the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] and is notable for its veiled description of how the mysteries of the [[deity]] [[Osiris]] were carried out in [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]]. The stela is 100&amp;nbsp;cm high and made of limestone. Osiris is depicted standing under a winged sun disk facing [[Senwosret III]]. The text is laid out below Osiris in twenty-four horizontal lines. Underneath the text, [[Ikhernofret]], a [[12th dynasty]] treasurer under Pharaoh [[Senwosret III]], is depicted at an offering table with his family.&lt;ref name="simpson"&gt;"''The Literature of Ancient Egypt''", [[William Kelly Simpson]], p425-427, Yale University Press, 2003, {{ISBN|0-300-09920-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rituals celebrated the god's kingship, death and resurrection.&lt;ref name="miriam"&gt;"''Ancient Egyptian Literature: The Old and Middle Kingdoms''", [[Miriam Lichtheim]], p123-125, University of California Press, 1975, {{ISBN|0-520-02899-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stela describes how Ikhernofret is regarded as a beloved "''foster child''" of the King who was made "''Companion of the King''" when twenty-six. He is sent on a mission to Abydos by the King  to carry out work in honour of the Kings Father "''Osiris, Foremost of the Westerners"''.&lt;ref name="miriam"/&gt;

The stela records how the festivities were celebrated in four main parts.&lt;ref name="jan"&gt;"''Death and Salvation in Ancient Egypt''", p227-229, [[Jan Assmann]], Translated by David Lorton, Cornell University Press, 2005, {{ISBN|0-8014-4241-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Procession of [[Wepwawet]] ("''The Opener of the Ways''"). Wepwawet was in this instance a manifestation of the triumphant [[Horus]] who came to the aid of his father Osiris. The rite involved excoriation rituals relating to the enemies of Osiris.

'''[[Interfaith marriage]] in [[Judaism]]''' (also called '''mixed marriage''' or '''intermarriage''') was historically looked upon with very strong disfavour by Jewish leaders, and it remains a controversial issue among them today. In the [[Talmud]] and all of resulting Jewish law until the advent of new Jewish movements following the Jewish Enlightenment, the "[[Haskala]]", interfaith marriage is completely prohibited, although the definition of ''interfaith'' is not so simply expressed.&lt;ref name="Kid68b"&gt;''[[Nashim|Kiddushin]]'' 68b&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 survey conducted in the United States by the [[Pew Research Center]]’s Religion &amp; Public Life Project found the intermarriage rate to be 58% among all Jews and 71% among non-Orthodox Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/01/us/poll-shows-major-shift-in-identity-of-us-jews.html|title=Poll Shows Major Shift in Identity of U.S. Jews|first=Laurie|last=Goodstein|date=1 October 2013|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the Bible ==
{{Original research|date=January 2015}}
The Biblical position on [[exogamy|exogamous marriage]] is somewhat ambiguous; that is, except in relation to intermarriage with a [[Canaan]]ite, which the majority of the [[Patriarchs (Bible)|Israelite patriarchs]] are depicted as criticising.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|24:2–4|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis||26:34–35|}}&lt;/ref&gt; This attitude is formalised in the [[Deuteronomic Code]], which forbids intermarriage with Canaanites,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|7:3|}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the basis that it might lead to a son, resulting from the union, being brought up to follow the Canaanite religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|7:4|}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle is essentially a general one, and the deuteronomic explanation doesn't clarify why it singles out the Canaanites in particular; one of the Talmudic writers took it to forbid all intermarriage with non-Jewish nations.&lt;ref&gt;Simeon, in ''[['Abodah Zarah]]'' 36b&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Numbers 25]], [[Phinehas|Phineas]] is praised by God for having punished an [[Israelite]] prince who (during an idolatrous feast) publicly cohabited&lt;ref&gt;that is, he publicly took her into a private area and cohabited with her there&lt;/ref&gt; with a [[Midianite]] woman (descendant of [[Abraham]] by his third wife and not called a Canaanite); this took place at a time when [[Moses]] himself had married a Midianite ([[Zipporah]]) (before he married a [[Cushi|Cushite]]) and foreign ([[Moab]]ite) women were inducing the Jews to perform idolatry. (Moabites were descendants of [[Lot (Bible)|Lot]], Abraham's nephew, not Canaanite.)

In several places in the [[Tanakh]], there are relations which obviously were intermarriages – for examples, [[King David]] is described as marrying the daughter of the king of [[Geshur]],&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|3:3|}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bathsheba as having married [[Uriah the Hittite]]. King Solomon is notable for having taken many foreign wives and serving their idolatries.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|11:3|}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deuteronomy itself implies that intermarriage to [[Edom]]ites or [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] was acceptable, by permitting the grandchildren of such people to be treated as Israelites.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|23:4–9|}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional commentators generally explain such verses as referring to situations where the Gentile partner had converted,&lt;ref&gt;Jewish Encyclopedia, Intermarriage, although there it is stated as a universal rule&lt;/ref&gt; and explicitly so in the latter case, where ''grandchildren'' are understood as being the grandchildren of converts.&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, Sanctity, Laws of Prohibited Relations, 12:17–25&lt;/ref&gt; In places, traditional commentators suggest that the person involved is not a Gentile, but a Jew who has lived in a Gentile country,&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi David Kimchi (Radak) on Uriah the Hittite (one opinion), and Itai the Gittite&lt;/ref&gt; or that the law of the captive woman&lt;ref&gt;Deuteronomy 21:10–14&lt;/ref&gt; is involved.&lt;ref&gt;Metzudot in the case of David&lt;/ref&gt;

In any case, after the [[Babylonian Captivity]] disquiet seems to have arisen about such exogamy; the [[Book of Malachi]] declares that the intermarriage with "the daughter of a foreign god" (something different from marrying a non-Jewish person) that had occurred was a profanity, though Malachi also argues against divorce. &lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Malachi|2|}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Jewish leaders made a formal complaint to [[Ezra]] about these marriages.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Ezra|9:1–2|}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ezra definitively extended the law against intermarriage to forbid marriage between a Jew and any non-Jew;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Ezra|10:10–11|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bibleverse||Nehemiah|10:31"&gt;{{bibleverse||Nehemiah|10:31|}}&lt;/ref&gt; he also [[excommunication|excommunicated]] those people who refused to divorce their foreign spouses.&lt;ref name="bibleverse||Nehemiah|10:31"/&gt;

Christine Hayes compares the Deuteronomic and Ezran viewpoints on intermarriage, and discusses in terms of ritual impurity and the fear of profaning the seed of Israel. First and foremost, Hayes holds that the fear of profaning the seed of Israel was the underlying rationale for the ban in exogamous marriage, rather than the ritual impurity of Gentiles in general. She also argues that the regulations on intermarriage in the times of Ezra were different from the restrictions on intermarriage according to the book of Deuteronomy. For example, the Ezra ban on intermarriage was different in that it was 1) Universal in scope, and 2) had the rationale that intermarriage was the profanation of the holy seed of Israel. &lt;ref&gt;Hayes, Christine. 1999. ‘Intermarriage and Impurity in Ancient Jewish Sources.’ Harvard Theological Review 92 (01): 3–36. doi:10.1017/s0017816000017831.&lt;/ref&gt; She elaborates on these differences by saying that the prohibition at the time the Torah was written was not based on the ritual impurity of all Gentiles; rather, only the Gentiles of the seven Canaanite nations that were specified were to be avoided. This was "based on the fear that intimate contact with the Canaanites will lead Israelites to imitate their idolatrous and immoral ways."&lt;ref&gt;Ibud. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Hayes contrasts the restrictions on intermarriage at the time the Torah was written with the time of Ezra by pointing out that the Torah did not prohibit intermarriage between all Gentiles, only those in the seven nations specified. Furthermore, the intent of the Ezra ban was different in that it was based on the preservation of a holy seed, as opposed to the idea in the Torah that contact with the Canaanites would lead to the Israelites imitating their idolatrous and immoral ways.

==Later laws and rulings==

Although most of the rabbis in the Talmud considered the Deuteronomic law to refer only to marriage to Canaanites, they considered all religious intermarriage to be prohibited at least rabbinically.&lt;ref name="Kid68b" /&gt;

Christian rulers regarded unions between Jews and Christians unfavourably, and repeatedly prohibited them under penalty of death.&lt;ref&gt;''Codex Theodosianus'', 16:8, 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Heinrich Graetz|Heinrich Grätz]], ''Geschichte der Juden'' (=''History of the Jews'') 4:363; 5:359; 7;27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Leopold Löw]], ''Gesammelte Werke'', 2:176&lt;/ref&gt;

Gradually, however, many countries removed these restrictions, and marriage between Jews and Christians (and [[Islam|Muslims]]) began to occur. In 1236 [[Moses of Coucy]] induced the Jews bespoused by such marriages to dissolve them.&lt;ref&gt;Moses of Coucy, ''Sefer Mitzvot ha-Gadol''&lt;!-- does this translate as "the big book of commandments" – No, as opposed to the smaller work, Sefer Mitzvot Katan --&gt;, 112&lt;/ref&gt; In 1807, Napoleon's [[Grand Sanhedrin]] declared that such marriages were valid and should not be treated as anathema.&lt;ref name="JewEncInter"&gt;{{Jewish Encyclopedia|article=Intermarriage|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?letter=I&amp;artid=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1844, the 1807 ruling was extended by the [[Rabbinical Conference of Brunswick]] to include ''any adherent of a monotheistic religion'';&lt;ref name="JewEncInter" /&gt; but they also altered it to forbid marriages involving those who lived in states that would prevent children of the marriage from being raised Jewish.&lt;ref name="JewEncInter" /&gt; This conference was highly controversial; one of its resolutions called on its members to abolish the Kol Nidre prayer, which opens the Yom Kippur service.&lt;ref&gt;Jewish Encyclopedia, "Conferences, Rabbinical"&lt;/ref&gt; One member of the Brunswick Conference later changed his opinion, becoming an opponent of intermarriage.&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Philippson, ''Israelitische Religionslehre'' (1865), 3:350&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional Judaism does not consider marriage between a Jew by birth and a convert as an intermarriage.&lt;ref&gt;[[Berakhot (Talmud)|Berakhot]] 28a&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi [[Yosef Karo]], ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]'' III:4:10&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, all the Biblical passages that appear to support intermarriages, such as that of [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]] to [[Asenath]], and that of [[Ruth (biblical figure)|Ruth]] to [[Boaz]], were regarded by the classical rabbis as having occurred only after the foreign spouse had converted to Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;Genesis Rabbah, 65&lt;/ref&gt; Some opinions, however, still considered Canaanites forbidden to marry even after conversion; this did not necessarily apply to their children.&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, Sanctity, Laws of Prohibited Relations, 12:22 and Maggid Mashnah ad. loc.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Shulchan Aruch]] and its commentaries&lt;ref&gt;III:16:2&lt;/ref&gt; bring various opinions as to when intermarriage is a Torah prohibition and when the prohibition is rabbinic.

A [[Child abandonment|foundling]] – a person who was abandoned as a child without their parents being identified – was classified as a non-Jew, in relation to intermarriage, if they had been found in an area where at least one non-Jew lived (even if there were hundreds of Jews in the area, and just one non-Jew);&lt;ref name="JewEncFound"&gt;{{Jewish Encyclopedia|article=Foundling|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?letter=F&amp;artid=281}}&lt;/ref&gt; this drastically contrasts with the treatment by other areas of Jewish religion, in which a foundling was classified as Jewish if the majority of the people were Jewish, in the area in which the foundling was found.&lt;ref name="JewEncFound" /&gt; If the mother was known, but not the father, the child was treated as a foundling, unless the mother claimed that the child was an Israelite (the claim would be given [[wiktionary:benefit of the doubt|the benefit of the doubt]]).&lt;ref&gt;''Ketubot'' 13a&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Kiddushin'' 74a&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Ketubot'' (Palestinian Talmud only) 1:9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern attitudes===
The [[Talmud]] and later [[halacha|classical sources of Jewish law]] are clear that the institution of Jewish marriage, ''kiddushin'', can only be affected between Jews.

The more liberal Jewish movements—including [[Reform Judaism|Reform]], [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]] (collectively organized in the [[World Union for Progressive Judaism]])—do not generally regard the historic corpus and process of Jewish law as intrinsically binding. Progressive rabbinical associations have no firm prohibition against intermarriage; according to a survey of rabbis, conducted in 1985, more than 87% of Reconstructionist rabbis were willing to officiate at interfaith marriages,&lt;ref&gt;''Survey of the American Rabbinate'', The Jewish Outreach Institute, [http://joi.org/library/research/rabbis.shtml] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090903010038/http://joi.org/library/research/rabbis.shtml |date=3 September 2009 }} (retrieved 6 May 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2003 at least 50% of Reform rabbis were willing to perform interfaith marriages.&lt;ref&gt;''Summary of Rabbinic Center for Research and Counseling 2003 Survey'', Irwin H. Fishbein, Rabbi, D. Min., Rabbinic Center for Research and Counseling, [http://www.rcrconline.org/research.htm] (retrieved 6 May 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; The Central Conference of American Rabbis, the Reform rabbinical association in North America and the largest Progressive rabbinical association, consistently opposed intermarriage at least until the 1980s, including their members officiating at them, through resolutions and responsa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://data.ccarnet.org/cgi-bin/respdisp.pl?file=146&amp;year=arr Reform Judaism and Mixed Marriage] CCAR Responsa (Vol. XC, 1980, pp. 86–102), American Reform Responsa 146.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://data.ccarnet.org/cgi-bin/respdisp.pl?file=149&amp;year=arr Rabbi Officiating at a Mixed Marriage] CCAR Responsa (Vol. XCII, 1982, pp. 213–215), American Reform Responsa 149.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://data.ccarnet.org/cgi-bin/respdisp.pl?file=147&amp;year=arr Prayer for Couple Contemplating Intermarriage] CCAR Responsa (1979), American Reform Responsa 147.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, however, Reform and Reconstructionist rabbis, according to [[Jack Wertheimer]], seem not at all concerned about intermarriage and have nothing to say in public about it. Neither are non-Jewish spouses usually encouraged to convert to Judaism anymore.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Wertheimer: ''[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:38ZPQBmRnXoJ:bjpa.org/Publications/downloadPublication.cfm?PublicationID%3D142+wertheim+all+quiet+on+the+religious+front&amp;hl=sv&amp;gl=fi&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESgdSLZa_dwnHcPWYqRup_tc7aAHwRn-G44rSPWEIzEjoU9TpI3BErwwax2XxaZ7qsHWibMWMpf5nJbWyiaF-eSxHaeK2JTZHXJBMtDTDaTnDaV9_GYhT8lZ0bUps0kLcPUjmfcV&amp;sig=AHIEtbQkkTi4WO7aS57FnEqQVDFACiZweA All Quiet on the Religious Front? Jewish Unity, Denominationalism, and Postdenominationalism in the United States]'' New York 2005, [[American Jewish Committee]].&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of their attitude to intermarriage itself, most rabbis from these denominations do still try to persuade intermarried couples to raise their children as Jews.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} In 2015 the [[Reconstructionist Rabbinical College]] voted to accept rabbinical students in interfaith relationships, making [[Reconstructionist Judaism]] the first type of Judaism to officially allow rabbis in relationships with non-Jewish partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/75811/reconstructionists-give-green-light-to-intermarried-rabbinical-students|title=Reconstructionists give green light to intermarried rabbinical students|newspaper=J. weekly|author=Lisa Hostein|date=1 October 2015|accessdate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Humanistic Judaism]] is a Jewish movement that offers a nontheistic alternative in contemporary Jewish life, and defines Judaism as the cultural and historical experience of the Jewish people. The [[Society for Humanistic Judaism]] answers the question "Is intermarriage contributing to the demise of Judaism?" on its website, stating, "Intermarriage is the positive consequence of a free and open society. If the Jewish community is open, welcoming, embracing, and pluralistic, we will encourage more people to identify with the Jewish people rather than fewer. Intermarriage could contribute to the continuity of the Jewish people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shj.org/humanistic-judaism/13-tough-questions/ |title=13 Tough Questions |publisher=Shj.org |date=2013-05-13 |accessdate=2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All branches of [[Orthodox Judaism]] follow the historic Jewish attitudes to intermarriage, and therefore refuse to accept that intermarriages would have any validity or legitimacy, and strictly forbid sexual intercourse with a member of a different faith. Orthodox rabbis refuse to officiate at interfaith weddings, and also try to avoid assisting them in other ways. Secular intermarriage is seen as a deliberate [[Apostasy in Judaism|rejection of Judaism]], and an intermarried person is effectively cut off from most of the Orthodox community, although some [[Chabad-Lubavitch]] and [[Modern Orthodox Jews]] do reach out to intermarried Jewish couples.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

The [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative Movement in Judaism]] does not sanction or recognize the Jewish legal validity of intermarriage, but encourages acceptance of the non-Jewish spouse within the family, hoping that such acceptance will lead to the spouse's [[conversion to Judaism]]. The [[Rabbinical Assembly]] Standards of Rabbinic Practice prohibit Conservative rabbis from officiating at intermarriages. The [[Leadership Council of Conservative Judaism]] recently published the following statement on intermarriage:
:''In the past, intermarriage... was viewed as an act of rebellion, a rejection of Judaism. Jews who intermarried were essentially [[Herem (censure)|excommunicated]]. But now, intermarriage is often the result of living in an open society... If our children end up marrying [[Goy|non-Jews]], we should not reject them. We should continue to give our love and by that retain a measure of influence in their lives, Jewishly and otherwise. Life consists of constant growth and our adult children may yet reach a stage when Judaism has new meaning for them. However, the marriage between a Jew and non-Jew is not a celebration for the Jewish community....''.&lt;ref&gt;''Leadership Council of Conservative Judaism'', ''Statement on Intermarriage'', Adopted on 7 March 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

==The exact definition of 'interfaith' marriage==

Different movements in Judaism have different views on [[who is a Jew]], and thus on what constitutes an ''interfaith'' marriage. Unlike Reform Judaism, the Orthodox and Conservative streams do not accept as Jewish a person whose mother is not Jewish, nor a convert whose conversion was not performed according to classical [[halacha|Jewish law]].{{fact|date=November 2015}}

Occasionally, a Jew marries a non-Jew who believes in God as understood by Judaism, and who rejects non-Jewish theologies; Jews sometimes call such people ''ethical monotheists''. [[Steven Greenberg (rabbi)|Steven Greenberg]], an Orthodox Rabbi, has made the controversial proposal that, in these cases, the non-Jewish partner be considered a ''[[ger toshav|resident alien]]'' – the biblical description of someone who is not Jewish, but who lives within the Jewish community; according to Jewish tradition, such ''resident aliens'' share many of the same responsibilities and privileges as the Jewish community in which they reside.{{fact|date=November 2015}}

==Impact and consequences==
In the early 19th century, in some less modernised regions of the world, exogamy was extremely rare—less than 0.1% of the Jews of Algeria, for example, practiced exogamy.&lt;ref&gt;Ricoux, ''Demography of Algeria'', Paris, 1860, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century, even in most Germanic regions of central Europe&lt;ref&gt;[[Prussia]], [[Bavaria]], [[Austria]], [[Bohemia]], etc.&lt;/ref&gt; there were still only a mere 5% of Jews marrying non-Jews.&lt;ref&gt;''Census for Prussian Statistics'', 1902, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Census of the Baverian Kingdom, Statistics Bureaux'', 1900, p. 259&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Statebook of Austria'' 8:283, Vienna, 1900&lt;/ref&gt; However, the picture was quite different in other locations; the figure was 18% for Berlin,&lt;ref&gt;''Statistics Yearbook'', 1902, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; and during the same period, nearly half of all Jews in [[Australia]] intermarried.&lt;ref&gt;specifically, 44% in [[New South Wales]]; ''Census of New South Wales, 1901'', Bulletin No. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

In more recent times, rates of intermarriage have increased generally; for example, the [[National Jewish Population Survey|US National Jewish Population Survey 2000-01]] reports that, in the [[United States of America]] between 1996 and 2001, nearly half (47%) of Jews who had married during that time period had married non-Jewish partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://judaism.about.com/od/americanjewry/a/amjews2000.htm |title=American Jewry Today - Jewish Population Statistics - 2000 NJPS National Jewish Population Survey |publisher=Judaism.about.com |date=2009-06-11 |accessdate=2013-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1990 [[National Jewish Population Survey]] reported an intermarriage rate of 52 percent among American Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://smyjewishlearning.atypica.com/history/Modern_History/1980-2000/American_Jewish_Community/NJPS_1990.shtml?HSTY |title=National Jewish Population Survey: 1990 - My Jewish Learning |publisher=Smyjewishlearning.atypica.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The possibility that this might lead to the gradual dying out of Judaism is regarded by most Jewish leaders, regardless of denomination, as precipitating a crisis. For this reason, as early as the mid 19th century, some senior Jewish leaders denounced intermarriage as a danger to the continued existence of Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;Geiger and Aub,Leipsic Synod 1869; ''Referate über die der Ersten Synode Gestellten Anträge'' p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States of America, other causes, such as more people marrying later in life, have combined with intermarriage to cause the Jewish community to decrease dramatically; for every 20 adult Jews, there are now only 17 Jewish children. Some religious conservatives now even speak metaphorically of intermarriage as a ''[[silent Holocaust|silent holocaust]]''. On the other hand, more tolerant and liberal Jews embrace interfaith marriage as an enriching contribution to a multicultural society. Regardless of attitudes to intermarriage, there is now an increasing effort to reach out to descendants of intermarried parents, each Jewish denomination focusing on those it defines as ''Jewish'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org|title=Chabad}}&lt;/ref&gt; secular and non-denominational Jewish organisations have sprung up to bring the descendants of intermarried parents back into the ''Jewish'' fold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.half-jewish.org|title=Beta-Gershom.org|publisher=half-jewish.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jgate.org|title=Protect IP|publisher=jgate.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emunahavot.net|title=Faith of our fathers|publisher=emunahavot.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://joi.org/|title=Jewish Outreach Institute|publisher=joi.org|access-date=6 May 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110203080059/http://www.joi.org/|archive-date=3 February 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, children of a Jewish parent were raised in the non-Jewish parent's religion while maintaining a sense of Jewish ethnicity and identity.

==Christian–Jewish relations==
{{main| Christianity and Judaism}}
In Christian–Jewish relations, interfaith marriage and the associated phenomenon of Jewish assimilation are a matter of concern for both Jewish and Christian leaders. A number of [[Progressive Christianity|Progressive Christian]] denominations have publicly declared that they will no longer convert Jews. They have made use of [[dual-covenant theology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jcrelations.net/en/?id=1499 Ecumenical Considerations on Jewish-Christian Dialogue] (World Council of Churches)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abrock.com/Attempt.html#valid|title=Should Christians Attempt to Evangelize Jews?|first=Allan R.|last=Brockway|publisher=abrock.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religioustolerance.org/chr_jcon3.htm Policies of mainline and liberal Christians towards proselytizing Jews] (religioustolerance.org)&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Jewish [[Proselytization and counter-proselytization of Jews|counter-missionary and anti-missionary organizations]], like [[Outreach Judaism]], help Jews make educated decisions and aid them to reject [[conversion (religious)|conversion]] to other religions, most often [[Christianity]], and intermarriage.&lt;ref&gt;David Cho, "Conversion Outreach Plan Stirs Outrage: Jews for Jesus Trains 600 for Street Work", ''The Washington Post'', 17 August 2004; Page B01 [https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A6464-2004Aug16 full text]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aishdas.org/torahnet/Counter-Missionary/ |title=Aishdas Torahnet |publisher=Aishdas.org |date= |accessdate=2011-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Israeli opposition to mixed marriages between Jewish women and Arab men ==

Many Israeli Jews oppose mixed relationships,&lt;ref&gt;Judy Maltz (2 June 2014), [http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/shavuot/.premium-1.596678 "Why interfaith marriage is on the rise in Israel - and why it's a problem"], ''Haaretz''&lt;/ref&gt; particularly relationships between Jewish women and non-Jewish Arab men. A 2007 opinion survey found that more than half of Israeli Jews believed intermarriage is equivalent to "national treason". A group of 35 Jewish men, known as "[[Lehava|Fire for Judaism]]", in the [[Jerusalem]] neighborhood of [[Pisgat Ze'ev]] started patrolling the neighborhood in an effort to stop Jewish women from dating Arab men. The municipality of [[Petah Tikva]] has also announced an initiative to prevent interfaith relationships, providing a telephone hotline for friends and family to "inform" on Jewish girls who date Arab men as well as psychologists to provide counselling. The city of [[Kiryat Gat]] launched a school programme in schools to warn Jewish girls against dating local Bedouin men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://new.jpost.com/JewishWorld/Article.aspx?id=155387 |title='Protecting' Jewish girls from Arabs |newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |date=2009-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/world/middle-east/israeli-drive-to-prevent-jewish-girls-dating-arabs |title=Israeli drive to prevent Jewish girls dating Arabs |publisher=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]] |first=Jonathan |last=Cook}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2010 [[Maariv (newspaper)|''Maariv'']] has reported that the [[Tel Aviv]] municipality had instituted an official, government-sponsored counseling program to discourage Jewish girls from dating and marrying Arab boys. According to supporters of the program, the girls are often ostracized for being Jewish, and (some) fall into drugs and alcohol or are prevented from leaving their Arab boyfriends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://coteret.com/2010/02/24/tel-aviv-presents-municipal-program-to-prevent-arab-boys-from-dating-jewish-girls/ |title=Tel Aviv presents: Municipal program to prevent Arab boys from dating Jewish girls |publisher=Coteret |date=2010-02-04 |first=Dimi |last=Reider |access-date=1 March 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100227053825/http://coteret.com/2010/02/24/tel-aviv-presents-municipal-program-to-prevent-arab-boys-from-dating-jewish-girls/ |archive-date=27 February 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of '''Islam in [[Japan]]''' is relatively brief in relation to the [[religion]]'s longstanding presence in other nearby countries. Islam is one of the smallest minority faiths in Japan, having more adherents in the country than the [[Bahá'í Faith in Japan|Bahá'í faith]], but fewer than [[Christianity in Japan|Christianity]]. There were isolated occasions of Muslims in Japan before the 19th century. Today, Muslims are made up of largely immigrant communities, as well as smaller ethnic Japanese community.&lt;ref name="KY"/&gt;

In 2016, Japan accepted 0.3% of [[refugee]] applicants, many of whom are Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/06/lives-limbo-japan-accepts-refugees-170608122312650.html|title=Lives in limbo: Why Japan accepts so few refugees|first=Annette|last=Ekin|publisher=[[Al Jazeera]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==
There are isolated records of contact between Islam and Japan before the opening of the country in 1853, possibly as early as the 1700s; some Muslims did arrive in earlier centuries, although these were isolated incidents.

===Medieval records===
[[File:Kashgari map.jpg|thumb|Kashgari's map features an island on the top, corresponding to the east from China.]]
The earliest Muslim records of Japan can be found in the works of the Muslim cartographer [[Ibn Khordadbeh]], who has been understood by [[Michael Jan de Goeje]] to mention Japan as the "lands of [[Wāḳwāḳ|Waqwaq]]" twice: ''East of China are the lands of Waqwaq, which are so rich in gold that the inhabitants make the chains for their dogs and the collars for their monkeys of this metal. They manufacture tunics woven with gold. Excellent ebony wood is found there.” And: “Gold and ebony are exported from Waqwaq.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200504/the.seas.of.sindbad.htm Saudi Aramco World: The Seas of Sindbad], [[Paul Lunde]]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Mahmud al-Kashgari|Mahmud Kashgari]]'s 11th century atlas indicates the land routes of the [[Silk Road]] and [[Japan]] in the map's easternmost extent.

===Yuan Dynasty's conflict with Japan===
{{main|Mongol invasions of Japan}}
[[File:Mōko Shūrai Ekotoba 2.jpg|thumb|right|The samurai Suenaga facing Mongol arrows and bombs. ''[[Mōko Shūrai Ekotoba]]'' (蒙古襲来絵詞), circa 1293]]
Within Kublai's court, his most trusted governors and advisers appointed by meritocracy with the essence of multiculturalism were: [[Semu]], [[Hui people|Hui]], [[Koreans]] and  [[Chinese people|Chinese]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muslimheritage.com/uploads/1001_Years_of_Missing_Martial_Arts%20.pdf 1001 Years of Missing Martial Arts]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="元史"&gt;[[History of Yuan]] 『元史』 卷十二 本紀第十二 世祖九 至元十九年七月壬戌（August 9, 1282）「高麗国王請、自造船百五十艘、助征日本。」&lt;/ref&gt; Because the [[Wokou]] extended support to the crumbling [[Song dynasty]], [[Kublai Khan]] initiated the [[Mongol invasions of Japan]].

The court of the [[Goryeo]] supplied [[Koreans|Korean]] troops and an ocean-going naval force for the Mongol campaigns. Despite the opposition of some of his Confucian-trained advisers, Kublai decided to invade [[Japan]], [[Burma]], [[Vietnam]], and [[Mongol invasion of Java|Java]], following the suggestions of some of his Mongol officials. He also attempted to subjugate peripheral lands such as [[Sakhalin]], where its indigenous people eventually submitted to the Mongols by 1308, after Kublai's death.

===Ming dynasty records===
[[File:Ryukyuan mission in Edo.jpg|thumb|A Ryukyuan [[Ryukyuan missions to Edo|embassy]] (favorable to [[Ming dynasty]], [[China]]) arrive in [[Edo]].]]
During the 14th century, [[Hongwu Emperor]] of the [[Ming dynasty]] made [[Ryukyu Kingdom]] a tributary vassal, and ethnic Chinese settlers consolidated the islands for their ruler in [[Nanjing]].

During that period there was contact between the [[Hui people|Hui]], general [[Lan Yu (general)|Lan Yu]] of the [[Ming dynasty]] and the [[Japanese swordsmithing|swordsmiths of Japan]]. According to Chinese sources, Lan Yu owned 10,000 [[Katana]], Hongwu Emperor was displeased with the general's links with [[Kyoto]] and more than 15,000 people were implicated for alleged treason and executed.&lt;ref&gt;(二十六年二月，錦衣衛指揮蔣瓛告玉謀反，下吏鞫訊。獄辭雲：「玉同景川侯曹震、鶴慶侯張翼、舳艫侯硃壽、東莞伯何榮及吏部尚書詹徽、戶部侍郎傅友文等謀為變，將伺帝出耤田舉事。」獄具，族誅之。列侯以下坐黨夷滅者不可勝數。手詔佈告天下，條列爰書為《逆臣錄》。至九月，乃下詔曰：「藍賊為亂，謀泄，族誅者萬五千人。自今胡黨、藍黨概赦不問。」胡謂丞相惟庸也。於是元功宿將相繼盡矣。凡列名《逆臣錄》者，一公、十三侯、二伯。葉升前坐事誅，胡玉等諸小侯皆別見。其曹震、張翼、張溫、陳桓、硃壽、曹興六侯，附著左方。)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Others implicated in the Lan Yu Case include: Han Xun (韓勛), Marquis of Dongping (東平侯); Cao Tai (曹泰), Marquis of Xuanning (宣寧侯); Cao Xing (曹興), Marquis of Huaiyuan (懷遠侯); Ye Sheng (葉升), Marquis of Jingning (靖寧侯); Cao Zhen (曹震), Marquis of Jingchuan (景川侯); Zhang Wen (張溫), Marquis of Huining (會寧侯); Chen Huan (陳桓), Marquis of Puding (普定侯); Zhang Yi (張翼), Marquis of Heqing (鶴慶侯); Zhu Shou (朱壽), Marquis of Zhulu (舳艫侯); Chahan (察罕), Marquis of Haixi (海西侯); Sun Ke (孫恪), Marquis of Quanning (全寧侯); He Rong (何榮), Count of Dongguan (東莞伯); Sang Jing (桑敬), Count of Huixian (徽先伯)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portuguese records===
Early European accounts of Muslims and their contacts with Japan were maintained by [[Portugal|Portuguese]] sailors who mention a passenger aboard their ship, an [[Arab]] who had preached [[Islam]] to the people of Japan. He had sailed to the islands in [[Malacca]] in 1555.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.IslamicJapanese.in|title=Islam In Japan|publisher=Islamic Japanese|accessdate=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0x1Io6VOuAIC&amp;pg=PA518&amp;dq=Portuguese+ship+Malacca+in+1555+Arab+Japanese.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IB1-UuDWEOH17AbOr4C4DQ&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Portuguese%20ship%20Malacca%20in%201555%20Arab%20Japanese.&amp;f=false Asia in the Making of Europe, Volume I: The Century of Discovery.] - [[Donald F. Lach]] - Google Books&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern records===
The first modern{{clarify|date=August 2015|reason= "modern" is after when?}} Muslim contacts{{clarify|date=August 2015|reason="contacts" is between who and Muslims?}} were with Indonesians who served aboard British and Dutch ships in the late 19th century.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

In the late 1870s, the [[Sirah Rasul Allah|biography of Muhammad]] was translated into Japanese. This helped Islam spread and reach the Japanese people, but only as a part of the history of cultures.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Another important contact was made in 1890 when the [[Ottoman Empire]] dispatched a naval vessel to Japan for the purpose of saluting the visit of Japanese [[Prince Komatsu Akihito]] to Constantinople several years earlier. This frigate was called the ''[[Ertuğrul (Ottoman frigate)|Ertugrul]]'', and was destroyed in a storm along the coast of Wakayama Prefecture on September 16, 1890.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==Early 20th century==
[[File:Abdürreşit-İbrahim-Efendi-1857-1944-ve-Çocukları.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Abdurreshid Ibrahim]] (center), Russian ([[Tatar]]) migrant to [[Meiji period|Meiji]] Japan, who became the first imam of [[Tokyo Camii]].]]
In the wake of the [[October Revolution]], several hundred Turko-[[Tatar]] Muslim refugees from [[Turkestan ASSR|Central Asia]] and [[RSFSR|Russia]] were given asylum in Japan, settling in several main cities and formed small communities. Some Japanese converted to Islam through contact with these Muslims. Historian Caeser E. Farah documented that in 1909 the Russian-born writer [[Abdurreshid Ibrahim]] (1857–1944), was the first Muslim who successfully converted the first ethnic Japanese, when Kotaro Yamaoka converted in 1909 in Bombay after contacting Ibrahim and took the name Omar Yamaoka.&lt;ref name="CEFBook"&gt;{{cite book|last=E. Farah|first=Caesar|title=Islam: Beliefs and Observations|publisher=Barron's Educational Series; 7th Revised edition|date=25 April approximately 600, 2003|isbn=978-0-7641-2226-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sAlDjVO7SowC&amp;pg=PA291&amp;dq=islam+in+japan&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3#PPA291,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yamaoka became the first Japanese to go on the [[Hajj]]. Yamaoka and Ibrahim were traveling with the support of nationalistic Japanese groups like [[Black Dragon Society]] (Kokuryūkai). Yamaoka in fact had been with the [[Japanese Secret Intelligence Services|intelligence service]] in [[Manchuria]] since the [[Russo-Japanese war]]. His official reason for traveling was to seek the Sultan's approval for building a mosque in Tokyo. This approval was granted in 1910, and on 12 May 1938, the [[Tokyo Mosque]], was finally completed, with generous financial support from the [[zaibatsu]]. Its first imams were Abdul-Rashid Ibrahim and Abdülhay Kurban Ali (Muhammed-Gabdulkhay Kurbangaliev) (1889–1972). However, Japan’s first mosque, the Kobe Mosque was built in 1935, with the support of the Turko-Tatar community of traders there.&lt;ref name="MPIslam"/&gt; On 12 May 1938, a Mosque was dedicated in Tokyo.&lt;ref name=R&amp;A890p1&gt;{{Harvnb|R&amp;A No. 890|1943|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another early Japanese convert was Bunpachiro Ariga, who about the same time as Yamaoka went to India for trading purposes and converted to Islam under the influence of local Muslims there, and subsequently took the name Ahmed Ariga. Yamada Toajiro was for almost 20 years from 1892 the only resident Japanese trader in Constantinople.&lt;ref&gt;His memoirs: Toruko Gakan, Tokyo 1911&lt;/ref&gt; During this time he served unofficially as [[consul (representative)|consul]]. He converted to Islam, and took the name Abdul Khalil, and made a pilgrimage to Mecca on his way home.

The [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]] was established in 1935 in Japan.&lt;ref name="around_the_world_137"&gt;''Ahmadiyya Muslim Mosques Around the World'', p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japanese nationalists and Islam===
[[File:Okawa_Shumei_c.jpg|thumb|left|[[Shūmei Ōkawa]], a [[Japanese nationalism|nationalistic]] [[Pan-Asianism|Pan-Asian]] writer described as the "Japanese Goebbels", completed the first Japanese translation of the Quran.]]
In the late [[Meiji period]], close relations were forged between Japanese military elites with an [[Pan-Asianism|Asianist]] agenda and Muslims to find a common cause with those suffering under the yoke of Western hegemony.&lt;ref&gt;Japan's Global Claim to Asia and the World of Islam: Transnational Nationalism and World Power, 1900-1945. S Esenbel. The American Historical Review 109 (4), 1140-1170&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906, widespread campaigns were aimed at Muslim nations with journals reporting that a Congress of religions was to be held in Japan where the Japanese would seriously consider adopting Islam as the national religion and that the Emperor was at the point of becoming a Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;Bodde, Derk. “Japan and the Muslims of China.” Far Eastern Survey, vol. 15, no. 20, 1946, pp. 311–313., www.jstor.org/stable/3021860.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nationalistic organizations like the Ajia Gikai were instrumental in petitioning the Japanese government on matters such as officially recognizing Islam, along with [[Shinto]]ism, [[Christianity]] and [[Buddhism]] as a religion in Japan, and in providing funding and training to Muslim resistance movements in Southeast Asia, such as the Hizbullah, a resistance group funded by Japan in the Dutch Indies. The {{nihongo|Greater Japan Muslim League|大日本回教協会|Dai Nihon Kaikyō Kyōkai}} founded in 1930, was the first official Islamic organisation in Japan. It had the support of imperialistic circles during [[World War II]], and caused an "Islamic Studies Boom".&lt;ref&gt;Most of its produced literature is preserved in the [[Waseda University Library]]({{cite web |url=http://dspace.wul.waseda.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2065/3973/1/100189_15.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306124103/http://dspace.wul.waseda.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2065/3973/1/100189_15.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-06 |df= }} Catalogue)&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, over 100 books and journals on Islam were published in Japan. While these organizations had their primary aim in intellectually equipping Japan's forces and intellectuals with better knowledge and understanding of the Islamic world, dismissing them as mere attempts to further Japan's aims for a "[[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere|Greater Asia]]" does not reflect the nature of depth of these studies. Japanese and Muslim academia in their common aims of defeating [[Western imperialism|Western colonialism]] had been forging ties since the early twentieth century, and with the destruction of the last remaining Muslim power, the Ottoman Empire, the advent of hostilities in [[World War II]] and the possibility of the same fate awaiting Japan, these academic and political exchanges and the alliances created reached a head. Therefore, they were extremely active in forging links with academia and Muslim leaders and revolutionaries, many of whom were invited to Japan.

[[Shūmei Ōkawa]], by far the highest-placed and most prominent figure in both Japanese government and academia in the matter of Japanese-Islamic exchange and studies, managed to complete his translation of the ''[[Qur'an]]'' in prison, while being prosecuted as an alleged [[class-A war criminal]] by the victorious Allied forces for being an 'organ of propaganda'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Okawa-Shumei|title=Okawa Shumei|publisher=Britannica|accessdate=6 March 2017|date=20 July 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charges were dropped for his erratic behaviour officially; however historians have speculated that the weakness of the charges against him was more likely the true reason. While Okawa did display unusual behaviour during the trial such as rapping on the head of [[Hideki Tōjō]], he also stated that the trial was a farce and unworthy of being called one.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} He was transferred to a hospital on official claims of mental instability and then prison, and freed not long thereafter, dying as Muslim in 1957 after a quiet life where he continued lecturing, on his return to his home village and his wife, who survived him. He claimed to have seen visions of [[Muhammad]] in his sleep.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

==Post–World War II==
The Turks have been the biggest Muslim community in Japan until recently.&lt;ref name="MIJ"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.missionislam.com/knowledge/japan.htm|title=Islam in Japan|publisher=Mission Islam.com|accessdate=27 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese invasion of China and South East Asian regions during the Second World War brought the Japanese in contact with Muslims. Those who converted to Islam through them returned to Japan and established in 1953 the first Japanese Muslim organisation, the "Japan Muslim Association", which was officially granted recognition as a religious organization by the Japanese government in June 1968.&lt;ref name="MPIslam"/&gt; The second president of the association was the [[Umar Mita]], who was typical of the old generation, learning Islam in the territories occupied by the [[Japanese Empire]]. He was working for the [[Manshu Railway Company]], which virtually controlled the Japanese territory in the northeastern province of China at that time. Through his contacts with Chinese Muslims, he became a Muslim in Peking. When he returned to Japan after the war, he made the Hajj, the first Japanese in the post-war period to do so. He also made a Japanese translation of the Qur'an from a Muslim perspective for the first time. [[Aljazeera]] also made a documentary regarding Islam and Japan called "Road to Hajj – Japan".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPa4OPuYQs0|title=Road to Hajj&amp;nbsp;— Japan - 26 Nov 09 - Pt 1|publisher=YouTube|date=26 November 2009|accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The economic boom in the country in the 1980s saw an influx of immigrants to Japan, including from majority Muslim nations. These immigrants and their descendants form the majority of Muslims in the country. Today, there are Muslim student associations at some Japanese universities.&lt;ref name="MPIslam"/&gt;

==Muslim demographics==
In 1941, one of the chief sponsors of the Tokyo Mosque asserted that the number of Muslims in Japan numbered 600, with just three or four being native Japanese.&lt;ref name=R&amp;A890p1 /&gt; Some sources state that in 1982 the Muslims numbered 30,000 (half were natives).&lt;ref name="CEFBook"/&gt; Of the ethnically Japanese Muslims, the majority are thought to be ethnic Japanese women who married immigrant Muslims who arrived during the economic boom of the 1980s, but there are also a small number of intellectuals, including university professors, who have converted.&lt;ref name="JapanWomenIslam"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MPIslam"/&gt; Most estimates of the Muslim population give a range around 100,000 total.&lt;ref name="CEFBook"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MPIslam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asiaquarterly.com/content/view/168/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202212653/http://www.asiaquarterly.com/content/view/168/|archivedate=2 February 2007|title=Islami in Japan|last=Penn|first=Michael|work=Harvard Asia Quarterly|accessdate=28 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2008/108408.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2008 - Japan]&lt;/ref&gt; Islam remains a minority religion in Japan, and there is no evidence as to whether its numbers are increasing.

Japanese scholars such as Hiroshi Kojima of the National Institute of Population and Social Security Research and Keiko Sakurai of Waseda University suggest a Muslim population of around 70,000, of which perhaps 90% are resident foreigners and about 10% native Japanese.&lt;ref name="KY"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://japanfocus.org/-Kawakami-Yasunori/2436/article.html|title=Local Mosques and the Lives of Muslims in Japan|last=Yasunori|first=Kawakami|author2=JapanFocus.org |date=May 30, 2007|publisher=JapanFocus.org |accessdate=27 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MPIslam"/&gt; Of the immigrant communities, in order of population size, are Indonesians, Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, and Iranians.&lt;ref name="MPIslam"/&gt; The Pew Research Center estimated that there were 185,000 Muslims in Japan in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2011/01/27/table-muslim-population-by-country/|title=Table: Muslim Population by Country|publisher=Pew Research Center|date=27 January 2011|accessdate=19 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

According to japanfocus.org, {{as of|2009|lc=on}} there were 30 to 40 single-story mosques in Japan plus another 100 or more apartment rooms set aside for prayers in the absence of more suitable facilities. 90% of these mosques use the 2nd floor for religious activities and the first floor as a halal shop (Imported food; mainly from Indonesia and Malaysia), due to financial problems, as membership is too low to cover the expenses. Most of these Mosques have only a capacity of 30 to 50 people.

'''Jiang Ziwen''' ({{zh|first=t|t={{linktext|蔣|子|文}}|s=蒋子文|p=Jiǎng Zǐwén}}) was a ''[[wei (rank)|wei]]'' of [[Moling (China)|Moling]] (modern [[Nanjing]]) [[county (China)|county]] in China during the [[Eastern Han Dynasty]].

Originally from [[Guangling District|Guangling]], now a district of [[Yangzhou]] in [[Jiangsu Province]], he became addicted to wine and women, but was nonetheless recognized for his unusual [[phrenology]]. In the course of putting down an insurrection, he was killed by a blow to the forehead.

During the [[Three Kingdoms]] era, people repeatedly reported encountering his spirit, so that [[Sun Quan]] called him the [[shanshen|God]] of [[Purple Mountain (Nanjing)|Bell Mountain]] ({{zh|labels=no|first=t|t={{linktext|鐘山|山神}} |s=钟山山神 |p=Zhōngshān Shānshén}}), a peak near Nanjing which was then also known as Jiangshan ({{lang|zh-hant|蔣山}}).

Following the introduction of [[Buddhism in China|Buddhism]] to China and the popularization of its [[god of the dead|king of the dead]] [[Yama (Buddhism)|Yama]], Jiang was placed in charge of the first of his [[Diyu|ten hells]] as the Qinguang King ({{zh|labels=no|first=t|t={{linktext|秦|廣|王|蔣}} |s=秦广王蒋 |p=Qínguǎng Wáng Jiǎng}}).

'''LALMA''' is a not-for-profit organization that was established in 1999 in response to the need for Spanish-language resources on [[Islam]].

According to its mission statement, LALMA "promotes a better understanding of Islam to the Spanish speaking community and establishes a forum of spiritual nurturing and social support to Latino Muslims, building bridges among the monotheistic community and advocating for [[social justice]] in accordance with Islamic values."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Brief History of LALMA | url = http://www.lalma.net/quienes-somos/|website = lalma.net|access-date = 2017-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially LALMA stood for '''Los Angeles Latino Muslims Association''', but after a restructuring to accommodate its growth, LALMA was renamed to '''La Asociacion Latino Musulmana de America'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Latino_Muslim_by_Design.html?id=vRcRngEACAAJ |author=Morales, Harold Daniel |title=Latino Muslim by Design|publisher=University of California, Riverside|isbn=9781267729910|year=2012|accessdate=2017-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=misreading&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8SxpAgAAQBAJ |author=Wimbush, Vincent L. |title=MisReading America: Scriptures and Difference.|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199975426|year=2013|accessdate=2017-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Szm2BQAAQBAJ |author=Laderman, Gary |title=Religion and American Cultures: Tradition, Diversity, and Popular Expression|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781322431697|year=2014|accessdate=2017-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jS_e5M1jZ18C |author=Ahmed, Akbar |title=Journey into America: The Challenge of Islam|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|isbn=9780815703877|year=2010|accessdate=2017-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljgp7cNG_zw |title=Hispanics are Embracing Islam in America |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=2010-01-30 |accessdate=2017-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=amel&gt;{{cite web|author=Amel S.

De Luca, 1989. {{ISBN|88-7813-193-8}}, {{ISBN|978-88-7813-193-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pool was part of a shrine dedicated to the water nymph [[Juturna]], and the name ''Lacus Iuturnae'' is also used for the spring and the shrine, both next to the pool.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Margareta Steinby, "Lacus Iuturnae" in ''[[Lexicon Topographicum Urbis Romae]]''.

==Legends==
The shrine marks a place where Roman legend claims the divine twins [[Castor and Pollux]] stopped to water their horses while passing through the city, and where they announced [[Rome|Roman]] victory at the [[Battle of Lake Regillus]], 495 BCE. During the Roman Empire, when another spring in the city had dried up, the [[Vestal Virgin]]s used this spring to supply water for their religious ceremonies. The water at the ''Lacus Iuturnae'' was thought to have healing properties. The elderly and infirm would go to the spring with offerings in order to secure the assistance of Juturna in curing their malady.&lt;ref&gt;Scullard, H. H.

== McWhirter’s theory ==
[[File:Lunar orbit.png|thumb|The geocentric view of the movement of the Nodes, which has a cycle of 18.6 years approximately.]]

=== The Nodal cycle ===
McWhirter’s main theory was that the major of primary trend of business volume and finance is clearly pointed out by the 18.6-year cycle of the [[Lunar node|North Node]] as it passes through the [[Astrological sign|twelve signs of the zodiac]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Time and Money: The Economy and the Planets|last=Gover|first=Robert|publisher=Hopewell Publications|year=2005|isbn=9780972690683|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a long-term trend, the four crucial points of the stock market are reached when the Node enters the four [[fixed sign]]s respectively:

*[[Aquarius (astrology)|'''Aquarius''']]: This is the &lt;u&gt;extreme low&lt;/u&gt; of business activity, the bottom of the cycle.
*[[Pisces (astrology)|Pisces]]: The business activity turns up from the bottom.
*[[Aries (astrology)|Aries]]: The business continues to go higher towards the normal level.
* [[Taurus (astrology)|'''Taurus''']]: The business activity reaches a &lt;u&gt;normal&lt;/u&gt; level, and the trend is going up.
*[[Gemini (astrology)|Gemini]]: The business activity starts to go above the normal level.
*[[Cancer (astrology)|Cancer]]: The business activity goes even higher.
*[[Leo (astrology)|'''Leo''']]: This is the &lt;u&gt;extreme high&lt;/u&gt; of business activity, the top of the cycle.
*[[Virgo (astrology)|Virgo]]: The business activity fades from the top.
*[[Libra (astrology)|Libra]]: The business continues to fall lower towards the normal level.
*[[Scorpio (astrology)|'''Scorpio''']]: The business activity reaches a &lt;u&gt;normal&lt;/u&gt; level, but the trend is going down.
*[[Sagittarius (astrology)|Sagittarius]]: The business activity starts to fall below the normal level. 
*[[Capricorn (astrology)|Capricorn]]: The business activity approaches the bottom of the cycle.

It has been noted that the four crucial signs (the top, bottom and two break-even points) correspond to the four heads of the [[cherub]]im in the [[Book of Ezekiel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Star Myths of the World|last=Mathisen|first=David Warner|publisher=Beowulf Books|year=2015|isbn=978-0996059022|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aspects and positions of major planets ===
[[File:Keplers trigon.jpg|thumb|The Jupiter-Saturn conjunction, as depicted in the Kepler’s trigon here, is one of the key factors in McWhirter’s system.]]
McWhirter also lists several secondary factors which tend to raise or depress business, mostly related to aspects of major planets like [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]], [[Neptune]] and [[Pluto]]:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== The NYSE natal chart ===
McWhirter maintained that one should pay attention when a planet moves to 14° [[Cancer (astrology)|Cancer]] (104°) and 24° [[Pisces (astrology)|Pisces]] (354°), because these places are where the [[Ascendant]] and [[Midheaven]] were when the [[New York Stock Exchange]] (NYSE) was initiated by an [[Buttonwood Agreement|agreement]] on 17 May 1792,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The London and New York Stock Exchanges 1850-1914|last=Michie|first=Ranald|publisher=Routledge|year=2011|isbn=9781136736681|location=Oxon, UK|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; though only after rectifying the exact time to 7:52 am.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Similarly, since the tenth house of the NYSE chart was in [[Pisces (astrology)|Pisces]] and [[Aries (astrology)|Aries]], which are ruled by [[Neptune]] and [[Mars]] respectively, she also thought that aspects to these two planets are important.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== New moon analysis ===
In a shorter timeframe, McWhirter uses the new moon for timing market turns.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The key idea is that she would pay attention to planets which make an astrological aspect to the new moon, and watch them as the moon passes through them later.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Vedic Code of Stocks- 2012 Monthly Predictions|last=Charran|first=Ram|publisher=Heendu Learning|year=2011|isbn=9781105350078|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparison with W. D. Gann ==


=== Identity suspicion ===
M. G. Bucholtz suspects that “Louise McWhirter” is not the author’s real name.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; His reason is that he comes across no other books by McWhirter and finds no other sources mentioning this person. He believes that the real identity of Louise McWhirter was famous market forecaster [[William Delbert Gann|W. D. Gann]], whom Bucholtz believes used similar techniques in market predictions. According to Pythagorean numerology, the names “W. D. Gann” and “Louise McWhirter” share the same numerological root of “9”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Science of Numerology Through the Law of Vibration|last=Laurie|first=John C.|publisher=Health Research Books|year=1959|isbn=9780787305376|location=Pomeroy, WA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The ancient science of numbers.

=== Gann’s financial timetable ===
One of the biggest connection between McWhirter and Gann is that McWhirter’s Nodal cycle theory is very similar to Gann’s “financial timetable”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Collected Writings of W.D. Gann|last=Gann|first=William Delbert|publisher=Sacred Science Institute|year=2015|isbn=9781942418085|volume=4|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is timetable with alternating 18- and 19-year cycle, which mimics the Nodal cycle very closely. Like McWhirter’s theory, Gann also found that the stock market follows a rhythm of 18–19 years.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The 17.6 Year Stock Market Cycle: Connecting the Panics of 1929, 1987, 2000 and 2007|last=Balenthiran|first=Kerry|publisher=Harriman House Limited|year=2013|isbn=9780857193094|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here is a modernised example of the table:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14670">'''Mahikari''' is a [[Japan]]ese [[new religious movement]] ([[Japanese new religions|shinshūkyō]]) that was founded in 1959 by [[Yoshikazu Okada]] (岡田 良一) (1901–1974). The word "Mahikari" means "True (真, ma) Light (光, hikari)" in [[Japanese language|Japanese]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Yasaka|1999|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foundation==
This organization was founded based on a revelation dated February 27, 1959. Okada said that this revelation related to the mission of bringing purification to the world and humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McVeigh, Brian|1992|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, he founded the organization, "L.H. Yokoshi Tomo no Kai" (陽光子友乃会 – Association of Positive People [children] of Light). In 1963, he registered the organization under the name "Sekai Mahikari Bunmei Kyodan" (World Divine Light Organization).

==Okada's world view==
Okada claimed that the revelation was from the Creator God, Mioya Motosu Mahikari Omikami ("Great Parent, Great Origin, True Light, Great God"), or simply, "Su (主, Lord) God." He mentioned his role to pioneer the introduction of the art of True Light, a method of spiritual purification that cleanses the spirit, mind, and body, and serves as an expedient to attaining happiness.

Okada claimed that the world was approaching a time of great upheaval, "baptism by fire," in which humanity will be cleansed through abnormal weather, social turmoil, and so on. He emphasized that humanity had entered this period in earnest from January 1, 1962. Okada said an increase in what he called the spiritual energy of fire would result in phenomena such as flooding, cold snaps, and potable water would becoming increasingly scarce. He said humankind needed to work hastily to develop techniques of turning sea water into drinkable water.

The holy scriptures of Mahikari consist of ''The Holy Words'' (''Goseigen'') and ''The Yōkōshi Prayer Book'' (''Norigotoshū'').


==Religious organization with similarities==

===Tenrikyo===
[[Tenrikyo]] was founded by Miki Nakayama (1798–1886). Its name means “Heavenly Wisdom” ("tenri" means heavenly wisdom and "kyo" means teaching or religion). During a healing ceremony, Miki reportedly entered a trance and said, “I am the True and Original God. I have been predestined to reside here. I have descended from Heaven to save all human beings, and I want to take Miki as the Shrine of God and the mediatrix between God and men.”

===Konkokyo===
[[Konkokyo]], which may be translated as “Golden Light,” was founded by Bunjiro Kawate (1814–1883) in 1859.  "[Kawate] found Parent of all men, the Parent-God of the Universe, who revealed himself ... as Tenchi-Kane-no-kami. It was on November the 15th of 1859 that the words of God came upon the Founder, calling him to the sacred mission of saving men, and revealing at the same time that the prosperity of mankind is the ultimate purpose of the Parent-God of the Universe, and that without the realization of that purpose God Himself is morally imperfect."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomsen|1963|p=70.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oomoto===
[[Oomoto]], which means “The Teaching of the Great Origin,” was founded in 1892 by [[Nao Deguchi]] (1836–1918). She claimed she had a visitation of a supernatural entity bestowing a mission on her to save humankind, that the origin was one, that mankind must return to that origin, and that humankind faced a great upheaval. Oomoto was promoted as the catalyst to unite all religions. Deguchi claimed to receive revelations from her god-deity, which she wrote down as the [[Ofudesaki (Oomoto)|Ofudesaki]], "From the Tip of the Brush," and used a healing method called ''Miteshiro'' (honorable hand-substitute) to drive out possessing spirits.

===Sekai Kyūsei Kyō===
[[Church of World Messianity|Sekai Kyūsei Kyō]] (世界救世教 – Church of World Messianity) was founded by [[Mokichi Okada]] (1882–1955). In June 1920, he joined Oomoto. Okada was a teacher in an Oomoto church in Tokyo in 1934 when he started using a process different from the official Oomoto healing method and was expelled.

Some of the practices practiced by devotees of Sekai Kyūsei Kyō are very similar to those practiced by Mahikari members. For example, the practise of ''Johrei'' (Purification of the Spirit), the imagined energy radiating from the hand, is similar to ''Mahikari no waza'' (True Light), and the ''Ohikari'', the pendant worn around the neck by members of Sekai Kyusei Kyo, is similar in concept to the ''Omitama'' pendant worn around the neck by Mahikari members.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McVeigh, Brian|1992|p=41.}} "The notion of a divine energy administered through the hand can be found in other New Religions. In Omoto there is the belief in shinki / reiki (divine spirit) that is radiated in a ritual called miteshiro (divine hand-substitute). Sekai Kyiiseikyb's hikari (light) is given in a ritual called jorei (spirit cleaning). Jorei is very similar to Mahikari's okijome, as is Omoto's miteshiro."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other Influences upon Yoshikazu Okada===

====''Hikari wa tōhō yori'' (Light from the East)====
"In a collection of [Okada's] sermons we find a chapter entitled “Light from the East,” which explains that the founders of the world’s great religions realized their teachings could not reveal the ultimate truth, and knew that such the truth would eventually come from the East. &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knecht, Peter|1995|p=337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kojiki, Record of Ancient Matters====
"Much earlier Mahikari mythology is attributed to the [[Kojiki]], Records of Ancient Matters, which was written circa 712 CE. Though the Kojiki is a depository of Shinto myths, it is well known to scholars as a “late compilation in which political considerations and specifically Chinese conceptions intrude themselves almost everywhere.” Mahikari utilizes many of the mythological deities found in the Kojiki but focuses on the Su God who personally chose Okada as his savior." &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weston, Erin Leigh|2002|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mahikari organizations==
The following organizations (listed in order of establishment date) are ''Shinshūkyō'' that were influenced by the world-view and practices of Yoshikazu Okada:

* 1959 : "L.H. Yokoshi Tomo no Kai" (Company of Sun Light Children) – name later changed to Sekai Mahikari Bunmei Kyodan
* 1963 : "Sekai Mahikari Bunmei Kyodan" – nominal membership – 50,000 to 100,000 worldwide (2007)
* 1974 : "Shin Yu Gen Kyu Sei Mahikari Kyodan"
* 1978 : "[[Sukyo Mahikari]]" (Japan) – nominal membership – 1,000,000+ worldwide (2009)
* 1978–1979 : "The Light Center" ([[Belgium]])
* 1980 : "Suhikari Koha Sekai Shindan" – nominal membership – 4,500 (2007)
* 1984 : "Yokoshi Tomo No Kai" ([[Singapore]])

===Sekai Mahikari Bunmei Kyodan===
Sekai Mahikari Bunmei Kyodan (World Divine Light Organization) is the name of an independent organization founded by [[Yoshikazu Okada]] in 1959 as "Yokoshi Tomo no Kai" (Association of Positive People [children] of Light). Okada was the organization's first "Holy Master" (Holy name: ''Seio, Kotama''). After Okada's death on June 23, 1974, the Reverend Seiho Sakae Sekiguchi (1909–1994) became the second "Holy Master" of the organization by "divine degree". During his leadership, the organization established the "Su-za World Main Shrine" in [[Mount Amagi]] on the [[Izu Peninsula]] on August 23, 1987. On January 3, 1994, the Reverend Seisho (Katsutoshi Sekiguchi (1939–) became the third "Holy Master" of the organization, also by "divine degree".

===Sukyo Mahikari===
[[Sukyo Mahikari]] (崇教真光) is the name of an independent organization founded by Keishu Okada in 1978, the adopted daughter of [[Yoshikazu Okada]], following his death and the subsequent legal dispute over leadership of Sekai Mahikari Bunmei Kyodan. The Sukyo Mahikari World headquarters is located at the "World Shrine" to the Creator God, which was completed in [[Takayama, Gifu|Takayama City]], [[Gifu Prefecture]], in 1984. The Takayama site also includes the [http://h-am.jp/ Hikaru Museum], a museum opened in 1999 that depicts the life and world-view of Mr. Okada and the Sukyo Mahikari organization.

===Suhikari Kōha Sekai Shindan===
Suhikari Kōha Sekai Shindan was founded in 1980 by the [[spiritualist]] and [[manga]] artist Kuroda Minoru (1928– ).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Inoue, Nobutaka|1991}} Kuroda is a known for his themes of ghost stories or the curses of spirits. His cartoons are popular especially among junior and senior high school girls. Since initiating his religious activities, Kuroda has used his cartoon drawings as a medium of missionary activities. He is also engaged in counseling young people.&lt;/ref&gt; Kuroda had been a follower of [[Yoshikazu Okada]] and Sekai Mahikari Bunmei Kyōdan. After Okada's death, Kuroda left that organization and, after receiving a [[revelation]], established the "Shūkyō Dantai Kōrin" in 1980, registering the group as an independent religious body under the Religious Corporations Law (Shūkyō Hōjinhō). In 1984 the group assumed its current name. Its headquarters are in Hachiōji City, Tokyo.

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Messiah'' Part III}}
'''''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]''''' ([[Händel-Werke-Verzeichnis|HWV]] 56), the English-language [[oratorio]] composed by [[George Frideric Handel]] in 1741, is [[Structure of Handel's Messiah|structured]] in three parts. This listing covers '''Part III''' in a table and comments on individual movements, reflecting the relation of the musical setting to the text. [[Messiah Part I|Part I]] begins with the prophecy of the [[Messiah#Christianity|Messiah]] and his [[Nativity of Jesus|birth]], shows the [[annunciation to the shepherds]] as a scene from the [[Gospel of Luke]], and reflects the Messiah's deeds on Earth. [[Messiah Part II|Part II]] covers the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]], death, resurrection, [[Ascension of Jesus|ascension]], and the later spreading of the Gospel. Part III concentrates on [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]]'s teaching of the [[1 Corinthians 15#Resurrection of the dead: 12-58|resurrection of the dead]] and Christ's [[Book of Revelation#Outline|glorification in heaven]].
{{TOC limit|3}}

== Messiah, the oratorio ==
The [[libretto]] by [[Charles Jennens]] is entirely drawn from the Bible, mostly from the [[Authorized King James Version|King James Bible]], whereas several [[psalms]] are taken from the [[Book of Common Prayer]].{{r|Vickers}}{{r|Powell 2009}} The librettist commented: "... the Subject excells every other Subject. The Subject is Messiah ...".{{r|Heighes 1997}} ''Messiah'' differs from Handel's other oratorios by telling no story, instead offering reflections on different aspects of the Christian [[Messiah#Christianity|Messiah]]. [[Christopher Hogwood]] comments:

{{quote
| ''Messiah'' is not a typical Handel oratorio; there are no named characters, as are usually found in Handel’s setting of the Old Testament stories, possibly to avoid charges of blasphemy. It is a meditation rather than a drama of personalities, lyrical in method; the narration of the story is carried on by implication, and there is no dialogue.
| [[Christopher Hogwood]]{{r|Block 2001}}
}}

=== Structure and concept ===

{{main|Structure of Handel's Messiah}}

The oratorio's structure follows the [[liturgical year]]; Part I corresponding with [[Advent]], Christmas and the life of Jesus, Part II with [[Lent]], Easter, [[Feast of the Ascension|Ascension]] and [[Pentecost]], Part III with the end of the church year, dealing with the end of time, the [[1 Corinthians 15#Resurrection of the dead: 12-58|Resurrection of the dead]] and Christ's [[Book of Revelation#Outline|glorification in heaven]]. The sources are drawn mostly from the [[Old Testament]].{{r|Powell 2009}} Even the birth and death of Jesus are told in the words of the prophet [[Isaiah]], the most prominent source of the libretto. The only true scene of the oratorio is taken from the [[Gospel of Luke]], the [[annunciation to the shepherds]].{{r|Luckett 1992}} The imagery of shepherd and lamb features prominently, in the aria "He shall feed His flock like a shepherd", the only extended piece to talk about the Messiah on earth, in the opening of Part II, "Behold the Lamb of God", in the chorus "All we like sheep", and in the closing chorus of the work, "Worthy is the Lamb". Occasionally verses from different biblical sources are combined in one movement, but more often a coherent text section is set in different consecutive movements, such as the first "[[Structure of Handel's Messiah#Scenes|scene]]", the annunciation of [[Christian salvation]], as a sequence of three movements, [[recitative]], [[aria]] and [[Choir|chorus]].

=== Music ===

When Handel composed ''Messiah'' in London, he was already a successful and experienced composer of Italian operas. He had started in 1713 to also compose sacred music on English texts, such as the ''[[Utrecht Te Deum and Jubilate]]''. He set many [[oratorio]]s on English [[Libretto|libretti]]. In ''Messiah'' he used practically the same musical means as for those works, namely a structure based on chorus and solo singing. Only a few movements are a [[duet]] or a combination of solo and chorus. The solos are typically a combination of recitative and aria. The arias are called Air or Song, some of them have [[da capo]] form, but rarely in a strict sense, repeating a first section after a sometimes contrasting middle section. Handel finds various ways to use the format freely, in order to convey the text. The movements marked "Recitative" (Rec.) are "secco", only accompanied by the [[Figured bass#Basso continuo|basso continuo]]. Recitatives marked "Accompagnato" (Acc.) are accompanied by additional string instruments. Handel uses four voice parts in both solo and chorus, [[soprano]] (S), [[alto]] (A), [[tenor]] (T) and [[Bass (voice type)|bass]] (B). Only once is the chorus divided in an upper chorus and a lower chorus, it is [[SATB]] otherwise. The orchestra scoring is simple: [[oboe]]s, [[String instrument|strings]] and basso continuo of [[harpsichord]], [[violoncello]], [[violone]] and [[bassoon]]. Two trumpets and [[timpani]] highlight selected movements, such as the closing movements of Part II, ''Hallelujah''. Handel uses a [[cantus firmus]] on long repeated notes especially to illustrate God's speech and majesty, such as "King of Kings" in the Hallelujah chorus.{{r|Burrows 1991}}

=== General notes ===

The following table is organized by movement numbers. There are two major systems of numbering the movements of ''Messiah'': the historic [[Novello &amp; Co|Novello]] edition of 1959 (which is based on earlier editions and contains 53 movements), and the [[Bärenreiter]] edition of 1965 in the [[Hallische Händel-Ausgabe]]. Not counting some short recitatives as separate movements, there are therefore 47 movements. In the table below, the Novello number (Nov) is given first and is the index for the notes to individual movements in the "movements" section, then the Bärenreiter number (Bär).

To emphasise the movements in which the oboes (ob) and the rarely used trumpets (tr) and timpani (ti) play, the summary below does not mention the regular basso continuo and the strings in movements. Details on the development of [[Key signature|key]]s, different [[tempo]] markings [[Time signature|time]]s within a movement are given in notes on the individual movements. Movements originally in Italian (It) are indicated in the Source column, however the exact origin is supplied in the notes on the movement.

== Part III movements ==

=== Scene 1 ===

[[Structure of Handel's Messiah#Scenes|Scene 1]] tells in an aria and a chorus of the resurrection, based on the Messianic anticipation in the [[Book of Job#In Christianity|Book of Job]] ({{sourcetext | source = Bible | version = King James | book = Job | chapter = 19 | verse = 25 | range = –26 }}) and [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]]'s teaching in his first epistle to the [[1 Corinthians 15#Resurrection of the dead: 12-58|Corinthians]] ({{sourcetext | source = Bible | version = King James | book = 1 Corinthians | chapter = 15 | verse = 20 | range = –22 }}).

==== 45 ====
{{Listen|type=music|filename=Handel - Messiah, Part 3 (Scherchen) - 46. I know that my Redeemer liveth.ogg|title=''I know that my redeemer liveth''|description=1953: [[Hermann Scherchen]] directing the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] and [[London Philharmonic Choir]]; Margaret Ritchie, soprano; Constance Schacklock, contralto; William Herbert, tenor; Richard Standen, bass; Frederick Jackson, chorus master; Thomas Matthews, violin; George Eskdale, trumpet.}}
'''I know that my Redeemer liveth'''

The Air for soprano "I know that my Redeemer liveth" draws from both Job and Paul. It begins with the "ascending [[Perfect fourth|fourth]]", a signal observed by musicologist Rudolf Steglich as a unifying motif of the oratorio,{{r|Luckett 1992}} on the words "I know", repeated almost every time these words appear again. "For now is Christ risen" is pictured in a steadily rising melody of more than an [[octave]].

==== 46 ====
{{Listen|type=music|filename=Handel - Messiah, Part 3 (Scherchen) - 47. Since by man came death.ogg|title=''Since by man came death''|description=(see above)}}
'''Since by man came death'''

The text for the chorus "Since by man came death" continues Paul's thoughts, juxtaposing death and resurrection twice. Consequently, Handel twice uses a Grave [[a cappella]] setting in [[A minor]] with [[Chromatic scale|chromatic]] lines, opposed to an Allegro with orchestra in [[C major]] in most simple harmony, switching back and forth between these extremes.

=== Scene 2 ===

[[Structure of Handel's Messiah#Scenes|Scene 2]] deals with Paul's teachings on the [[1 Corinthians 15#Resurrection of the body: 35-58|Resurrection of the body]] on the [[Day of Judgement]], as written in his First Epistle to the Corinthians. Accompagnato and Air share three verses, {{sourcetext | source = Bible | version = King James | book = 1 Corinthians | chapter = 15 | verse = 51 | range = –53 }}. Handel breaks the text in the middle of the second verse, to open the aria with the musical idea "the trumpet shall sound". The image, first found in Exodus 19, pictures a courtly herald who blew the trumpet as a signal that the king was about to enter the throne room, a signal to stand in his honour.{{r|Block 2001}} The passage from 1 Corinthians 15 was also chosen by Johannes Brahms for ''[[A German Requiem (Brahms)|Ein deutsches Requiem]]'', but in the German translation of the Bible the instrument is a [[trombone]].

==== 47 ====
{{Listen|type=music|filename=Handel - Messiah, Part 3 (Scherchen) - 48. Behold, I tell you a mystery.ogg|title=''Behold, I tell you a mystery''|description=(see above)}}
'''Behold, I tell you a mystery'''

"Behold, I tell you a mystery" is rendered as a bass accompagnato in [[D major]]. Towards the end, [[Motif (music)|motif]]s like trumpet signals appear in the strings even before the last words "at the last trumpet".

==== 48 ====
{{Listen|type=music|filename=Handel - Messiah, Part 3 (Scherchen) - 49. The trumpet shall sound.ogg|title=''The trumpet shall sound''|description=(see above)}}
'''The trumpet shall sound'''

The Air for bass "The trumpet shall sound", marked "Pomposo, ma non allegro", is a [[da capo aria]]. In the work's only instrumental solo, the trumpet provides motifs which the bass picks up. In "and we shall be changed", the word "changed" is treated in inventive ever-changing [[melisma]]s of up to six measures. In the middle section, the word "immortality" is expressed in a lively melisma of first eight, then nine measures.

=== Scene 3 ===

[[Structure of Handel's Messiah#Scenes|Scene 3]] first continues the text of Scene 2 ({{sourcetext | source = Bible | version = King James | book = 1 Corinthians | chapter = 15 | verse = 54 | range = –57 }}), presented in recitative, duet and chorus, and ends with an Air on Paul's [[Epistle to the Romans#Assurance of salvation (Rom 5-8,9-11)|Assurance of salvation]], as written in the Epistle to the Romans, {{sourcetext | source = Bible | version = King James | book = Romans | chapter = 8 | verse = 31 | range = ,33–34 }}.

==== 49 ====
{{Listen|type=music|filename=Handel - Messiah, Part 3 (Scherchen) - 50. Then shall be brought to pass.ogg|title=''Then shall be brought to pass''|description=(see above)}}
'''Then shall be brought to pass'''

An alto recitative delivers "Then shall be brought to pass", ending on "death is swallow'd up in victory".

==== 50 ====
{{Listen|type=music|filename=Handel - Messiah, Part 3 (Scherchen) - 51. O death, where is thy sting.ogg|title=''O death, where is thy sting?''|description=(see above)}}
'''O death, where is thy sting?'''

"O death, where is thy sting?" is sung as a [[duet]] in [[E flat major]] of alto and tenor on a [[walking bass]] of the continuo, without strings. The movement is based on the duet for soprano and alto "Se tu non lasci amore" (HWV 193, 1722).{{r|compositionslist}} Such a movement would remind the London listeners of love duets concluding operas, such as the final scene of "[[Giulio Cesare in Egitto|Giulio Cesare]]."{{r|Keates 2007}}

==== 51 ====
{{Listen|type=music|filename=Handel - Messiah, Part 3 (Scherchen) - 52. But thanks be to God.ogg|title=''But thanks be to God''|description=(see above)}}
'''But thanks be to God'''

The chorus answers in the same key and tempo "But thanks be to God".

==== 52 ====
{{Listen|type=music|filename=Handel - Messiah, Part 3 (Scherchen) - 53. If God be for us, who can be against us.ogg|title=''If God be for us, who can be against us''|description=(see above)}}
'''If God be for us, who can be against us'''

The scene closes with the assurance "If God be for us, who can be against us". As a contrast to the following choral conclusion of the oratorio, it is sung by the soprano. Towards the end, Handel quotes the characteristic intervals beginning [[Martin Luther]]'s [[chorale]] ''[[Aus tiefer Not schrei ich zu dir]]'' several times, leading into the final chorus.

=== Scene 4 ===

[[Structure of Handel's Messiah#Scenes|Scene 4]] closes the work by visionary verses from the Book of Revelation, [[Book of Revelation#Outline|The creatures in heaven give praise]] ({{sourcetext | source = Bible | version = King James | book = Revelation | chapter = 5 | verse = 12 | range = –13 }}), affirmed by an extended [[Amen]].

==== 53 ====
{{Listen|type=music|filename=Handel - Messiah, Part 3 (Scherchen) - 54. Worthy is the Lamb. Amen.ogg|title=''Worthy is the Lamb that was slain, Amen.''|description=(see above)}}
[[File:Worthy-is-the-lamb.jpg|thumb|300px|Beginning of "Worthy is the Lamb", ending Part III, in Handel's manuscript]]
'''Worthy is the Lamb that was slain'''

The chorus, with the full orchestra including trumpets and timpani, proclaims in a solemn Largo "Worthy is the Lamb that was slain", and continues Andante "to receive power – and riches, – and wisdom, – and strength, – and honour, – and glory, – and blessing". The sequence of Largo and Andante is repeated, but not exactly the same music. A fugue carries the words "Blessing and honour, glory and pow'r be unto him". The men's voices and the continuo begin in [[unison]], the simple theme rises to a note which is repeated nine times and falls back, reminiscent of the repeated notes in "[[Messiah Part I#4|For the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it]]" and "[[Hallelujah chorus|King of Kings]]". Several countersubjects add life and texture, gradually more instruments take part in the development on "for ever – and ever". These words are rendered in short downward runs, but then also in the same rhythm as in the [[Hallelujah chorus]], and finally broadened to Adagio. The "Amen" begins again simply in the bass and continuo. An intricate melody rises in four measures and one octave. Every other voice, tenor, alto, soprano, also sings the theme once. Rather unexpectedly, a solo violin plays the theme, first unsupported, then assisted by a continuo entrance of the theme, interrupted by a choral four-part setting with the theme in the bass. After two more instrumental measures, a four-part-setting develops to imitation and [[counterpoint]] of more and more independent voices, ending on a rest of a full measure. Finally, Amen is repeated two more times, Adagio.

A contemporary critic, conditioned by John Brown who objected to operatic features in oratorios such as recitatives, long ritornellos, and ornamented vocal lines, commented on Handel's display of musical inventiveness and "contrapuntal skill"{{r|Keates 2007}}: "The fugue too, on Amen, is entirely absurd, and without reason: at most, Amen is only a devout fiat, and ought never, therefore, to have been frittered, as it is, by endless divisions on A— and afterwards men."{{r|Heighes 1997}} But Handel's first biographer, [[John Mainwaring]], wrote in 1760 that this conclusion revealed the composer "rising still higher" than in "that vast effort of genius, the Hallelujah chorus".{{r|Luckett 1992}} [[Christopher Hogwood]] comments: "the entry of the trumpets marks the final storming of heaven".{{r|Hogwood 1991}} [[Daniel I. Block]] summarized in 1997: "... in this piece we see the remarkable confluence of Hebrew theology and biblical truth, Italian operatic genius, English class, and German piety."{{r|Block 2001}}

'''Emilie Cosman''', known as '''Milein Cosman''', (31 March 1921 – 21 November 2017) was a German-born artist based in England. She is best known for her drawings and prints of leading cultural figures, dancers and musicians in action, such as [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]], [[Mikhail Baryshnikov]], [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[Igor Stravinsky]].

==Biography==
Milein Cosman was born in [[Gotha (town)|Gotha]], Germany, in 1921 but spent most of her childhood in [[Düsseldorf]]. Because of her Jewish background and the rise of [[Nazism|National Socialism]], she went to school in Switzerland, at the [[Ecole d'Humanité]] and the [[International School of Geneva]] between 1937 and 1939. She came to England in 1939.&lt;ref name="Spalding"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Frances Spalding]]|publisher=Antique Collectors' Club|year=1990|title=20th Century Painters and Sculptors |ISBN=1 85149 106 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1939 and 1942, Cosman studied at the [[Slade School of Art]].&lt;ref name="Spalding"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BuckmanVol1"/&gt; The Slade was located in [[Oxford]] during the war years and there Cosman studied drawing under [[Randolph Schwabe]] and [[lithography]] under [[Harold Jones (artist)|Harold Jones]].&lt;ref name=Hopkinson&gt;{{cite web |author=Amanda Hopkinson|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/dec/04/milein-cosman-obituary |title=Milein Cosman obituary |date=4 December 2017|accessdate=4 December 2017|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943 she attended evening classes at [[Oxford Polytechnic]], where she was taught by [[Bernard Meninsky]].&lt;ref name=Hopkinson/&gt; In the same year she started teaching French and Art at a convent school as well as giving lectures on Art for the [[Workers' Educational Association]] (WEA).

In 1946, Cosman moved to London. She began book illustration and working as a freelance artist, while continuing to teach evening classes for the WEA and working for the [[American Broadcasting Station in Europe]]. She contributed drawings to national and international magazines and newspapers, including the BBC’s ''[[Radio Times]]''.&lt;ref name=Hopkinson/&gt;&lt;ref name="BuckmanVol1"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Buckman|publisher=Art Dictionaries Ltd|year=2006|title=Artists in Britain Since 1945 Vol 1, A to L |ISBN=0 953260 95 X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly noteworthy is a commission from ''[[Heute (Zeitschrift)|Heute]]'' to draw [[Konrad Adenauer]]'s post-war cabinet in Germany 1949.

In 1947, Cosman met the Viennese-born musician, writer, broadcaster and teacher [[Hans Keller]] (1919-1985), whom she married in 1961.&lt;ref name=Hopkinson/&gt;&lt;ref name="BuckmanVol1"/&gt; Some books of his writings – ''The Jerusalem Diary'' (2001), ''Stravinsky The Music Maker'' (2010) and ''Britten'' (2013), for example – include many of her drawings and prints.

Milein Cosman made a series of schools programmes on drawing for [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] in 1958.&lt;ref name=Hopkinson/&gt; In all, she has had nearly 30 solo exhibitions in the UK and abroad and her work has been acquired by many leading museums including the [[British Museum]], the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], the [[National Portrait Gallery (United Kingdom)|National Portrait Gallery]], the [[Ashmolean Museum]], the [[Fitzwilliam Museum]] in Cambridge, the [[Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery|Hunterian Museum]] in Glasgow, the [[Centre for Fine Arts, Brussels|Palais des Beaux-Arts]] in Brussels and the [[Kupferstichkabinett Berlin|Kupferstichkabinett]] in Berlin.&lt;ref name=Lebrecht&gt;{{cite web |author=|url=https://www.lebrecht.co.uk/blog/?p=10788 |title=Milein Cosman obituary |year=2017|accessdate=4 December 2017|work=Music + Arts Pictures at Lebrecht}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was renowned for drawing quickly, and much of her work was done from the wings or auditorium during rehearsals for concerts, theatrical and dance performances, capturing movement “in mid-flight” as [[Ernst Gombrich]] put it.

In 2006, Cosman founded the Cosman Keller Art and Music Trust, which aims to support young musicians and artists as well as publishing, exhibiting and archiving her own and Hans Keller’s work.&lt;ref name=Hopkinson/&gt; In 2014, a documentary film on Milein Cosman made by Christoph Böll was premiered in Düsseldorf in her presence.&lt;ref name=Hopkinson/&gt;

She died in November 2017.&lt;ref name=Lebrecht/&gt;

[[File:MiraclesLewis.jpg|thumb|First edition (1947)]]

'''''Miracles''''' is a book written by [[C.&amp;nbsp;S. Lewis]], originally published in 1947 and revised in 1960. Lewis argues that before one can learn from the study of history whether or not any miracles have ever occurred, one must first settle the philosophical question of whether it is logically possible that miracles can occur in principle. He accuses modern historians and scientific thinkers, particularly secular biblical scholars, of [[begging the question]] against miracles, insisting that modern disbelief in miracles is a cultural bias thrust upon the historical record and is not derivable from it.

In a chapter on "The Naturalist and the Supernaturalist" Lewis gives technical definitions to the two terms. Naturalists, under his definition, believe that the Universe is a vast process in which all events which ever happen find their [[Four causes|causes]] solely in the events that happened before them within the system. Supernaturalists believe that interruptions or interferences can take place in this system of our Universe from some other system outside it. A supernatural event would be one that is not traceable, even in principle, solely to materially determined causes within our Universe. [[Libertarian free will]], if it exists, would have to be supernatural under this view.

In a chapter on "Natural Laws", Lewis addresses the issue of whether miracles are incompatible with natural law or science. He argues that rather than being mutually exclusive, miracles are definite interventions that go beyond natural laws. Miracles are consistent with nature, but beyond natural law.

Lewis makes a case for the reality of miracles by presenting the position that something more than nature, a supernatural world, may exist, including a benevolent creator likely to intervene in reality after creation.

All of the major miracles of the [[New Testament]] are addressed, with the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnation]] playing the central role. Also included are two appendices which deal with matters of free will and the value of prayer.

== Argument from reason ==
{{Main|Argument from reason}}

Philosophers and scientists including [[Victor Reppert]], [[William Hasker]], and [[Alvin Plantinga]] have expanded on the "Argument from reason" and credit Lewis with first bringing the argument to light in ''Miracles''.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"&gt;Reppert, Victor. ''C.S. Lewis's Dangerous Idea'', Downers Grove, Illinois: InterVarsity Press, 2003. {{ISBN|0-8308-2732-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The argument holds that if, as thoroughgoing naturalism entails, all of our thoughts are the effect of a physical cause, then there is no reason for assuming that they are also the consequent of a reasonable ground. Knowledge, however,  is apprehended by reasoning from ground to consequent. Therefore, if naturalism were true, there would be no way of knowing it, or anything else not the direct result of a physical cause.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"/&gt;

Lewis asserts that by this logic, the statement "I have reason to believe naturalism is valid" is self-referentially incoherent in the same manner as the sentence "One of the words of this sentence does not have the meaning that it appears to have", or the statement "I never tell the truth".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/darek_barefoot/dangerous.html A Response to Richard Carrier's Review of C.S. Lewis's Dangerous Idea]&lt;/ref&gt; In each case, to assume the veracity of the conclusion would eliminate the possibility of valid grounds from which to reach it. To summarize the argument in the book, Lewis quotes [[J.&amp;nbsp;B.&amp;nbsp;S. Haldane]] who appeals to a similar line of reasoning. Haldane states "If my mental processes are determined wholly by the motions of atoms in my brain, I have no reason to suppose that my beliefs are true ... and hence I have no reason for supposing my brain to be composed of atoms."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophy.uncc.edu/mleldrid/intro/csl3.html The Cardinal Difficulty Of Naturalism]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revisions==
The original version of ''Miracles'' contained a different version of chapter 3 entitled "The Self-Contradiction of the Naturalist". In it, Lewis made the same argument but referred to atomic motions in the brain as "irrational". In a [[Socratic Club]] debate, [[G.&amp;nbsp;E.&amp;nbsp;M. Anscombe]] criticized this, prompting Lewis to revise the chapter. The revised chapter presents a more detailed elucidation of the argument and distinguishes between "non-rational" and "irrational" processes. Anscombe commented on the process after Lewis's death that the rewrite showed "honesty and seriousness" on the part of Lewis.&lt;ref&gt;From the introduction to ''Metaphysics and the Philosophy of Mind'' by G.&amp;nbsp;E.&amp;nbsp;M. Anscombe, 1981. {{ISBN|0-6311-3309-7}}; for a full survey  and discussion of differences between first edition and revised edition see www.lewisiana.nl/anscombe.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Moral Orel''''' is an American [[adult animation|adult]] [[Stop motion|stop-motion animated]] television series, which originally aired on [[Adult Swim]] from December 13, 2005 to December 18, 2008. The series has been described as "''[[Davey and Goliath]]''... meets ''[[South Park]]''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.creators.com/opinion/brent-bozell/shower-after-adult-swim.html |title=Shower after 'Adult Swim' |last=Bozell |first=L.

Faith-Based Mockery | work=[[The New York Times]] | accessdate=2016-01-15 | first=Dan | last=Crane}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2008 [[San Diego Comic-Con]], Stamatopoulos announced that the show would not be renewed for a fourth season. The final season was aired interspersed with repeats from the first two  seasons, since many of the episodes took place in parallel with events of past episodes. The event, which was called "44 Nights of Orel", was hosted by Stamatopoulos and others and started on October 6, 2008, running through December 18, when the series finale premiered. A [[Television special|special]] entitled "Beforel Orel" later aired on November 19, 2012.

==Plot==
The program takes place in the fictional [[List of capitals in the United States|capital city]] of Moralton, in the fictional [[Bible Belt]] [[U.S. state|state]] "[[List of fictional U.S. states|Statesota]]."  According to the globe shown in the opening credits, Moralton is in the exact center of the United States, with the town's church at the exact center of the town.

The main character is Orel Puppington, a student at Alfred G. Diorama Elementary School, who tries to live by the [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] [[Protestant]] [[Christian]] [[Morality|moral code]] as articulated in church or by his father, Clay.  Orel naïvely follows this code to disastrous extremes.  The series is a satire of the archetypes of Middle American suburban life, modern-day [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASP]] culture, alcoholism, and religious [[fundamentalism]] with weighty emotional undertones that increase dramatically as the series progresses.

{{Main article|List of Moral Orel characters}}
* Orel Puppington is a devout [[Christian]] boy who cheerfully and naïvely deals with an alcoholic and abusive father, an emotionally distant/starving and cleaning-obsessed mother, and the hypocrisy of the religious adults whom he encounters.
* Clay Puppington is Orel's father.  He is a cynical alcoholic who hates his dead end job and his wife.
* Bloberta Puppington is Orel's mother.  Seemingly cheerful, she tends to ignore all conflict or problems.
* Shapey Puppington, Orel's half-brother, is a misbehaving, spoiled, emotionally stunted little boy who does nothing but yell/scream bloody-murder (usually wordlessly) and act out, like a toddler.
* Rev. Rod Putty, the town's resident pastor of the church, a laid-back, caring yet lonely and sexually frustrated man whom Orel looks up to for advice. Later on, he shares a healthy relationship with his formerly unknown daughter, Stephanie (whom he originally hit on), a punk-rocker who owns a sex shop.

The first season of the show followed a standard formula: Orel would hear a sermon in church on Sunday, then proceed to have some sort of misadventure based on his attempts to live by his (usually warped) interpretation of the lesson.  At the end of each episode, his father would sternly put a halt to the proceedings and "correct" Orel (by means of [[corporal punishment]])—only to offer an even more warped interpretation (in the first season this would be one of the "Lost Commandments"). Before the end titles, Clay Puppington's trousers would fall down as a [[running gag]], because he had removed his belt to "correct" Orel beforehand. Throughout the season, the series' primary characters were introduced and various subplots were established, such as Orel's father being a closeted bisexual in love with Orel's gym teacher, and Orel's mother being an unhappily married housewife feeling trapped in her marriage.

The second season of the show broke the first season format and began to build upon the subplots introduced in the first season, making them the primary focus of the show. Although still the primary character, Orel became less a catalyst for each episode's events than an unwitting bystander often left confused and dejected at the end of an episode, who found himself unable to reconcile his optimistic nature and faith with the corruption and cynicism of the adults around him, particularly his father. The season culminated in a two-part episode dealing with a camping trip, during which Orel lost all faith in his father. The finale—"Nature (Part 1)" and "Nature (Part 2)"—marked a darker turn in the series' tone, de-emphasizing the cynical parody of the previous two seasons in favor of exploring darker, more disturbing themes and character behavior.

The third and final season of the show was structured as a massive, interconnecting, thirteen-part story dealing with the events leading up to and during the camping trip, and their long-reaching implications. It is revealed that during the trip, Orel's father gets drunk and shoots Orel in the leg, only to express a complete lack of remorse or sense of responsibility afterward. The series culminates in the ultimate dissolution of Clay's relationship with Orel's coach, and the revelation that Orel will one day be able to put his unhappy childhood behind him to raise a better family than the one in which he grew up.

Originally, before being cut down to a 13-episode third season and later cancelled, the show was going to have two more seasons and evolve into a show entitled ''Moralton'' that would revolve around the life of the residents of Moralton as a whole.&lt;ref name=Wolinsky/&gt;

The series was troubled throughout its run. Against the wishes of creator Stamatopoulos, the Christmas-themed first-season finale, "The Best Christmas Ever", was aired as the series premiere.  Adult Swim wanted to debut the show in December as part of a holiday-themed programming block. The episode—which featured the culmination of numerous story arcs developed throughout the first season, and ended with a [[cliffhanger]]—confused viewers and prompted some questions on Adult Swim's message boards as to whether or not the episode was a one-off practical joke. When the series eventually premiered, three episodes were held back because Cartoon Network's [[Standards &amp; Practices]] Department found them to be too dark and sexually explicit, even for a late night program aimed at adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aoltv.com/2006/10/27/dino-stamatopoulos-the-tv-squad-interview/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722044420/http://www.aoltv.com/2006/10/27/dino-stamatopoulos-the-tv-squad-interview/|archive-date=22 July 2012|first=Adam|last=Finley|title=Dino Stamatopoulos: The TV Squad Interview|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=2016-01-15|date=Oct 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  All were eventually approved; two aired in May 2006, and the third aired on July 31, 2006. The series would ultimately be canceled with seven scripts left unproduced, cutting the third season down from the intended twenty episodes to thirteen.

==2012 special==
After the 2011 Halloween mini-marathon for ''[[Mary Shelley's Frankenhole]]'', Orel himself announced the upcoming ''Moral Orel'' special and its release "sometime in the near future".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bumpworthy.com/bumps/4318|title=Frankenhole Halloween 2011, 8|work=[[Adult Swim]]|date=October 31, 2011|accessdate=2016-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Beforel Orel" was officially announced on Dino's official [[Twitter]] page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet |user=@DinosThirdTwitt|author=Dino Stamatopoulos|number=204210452010516483|date=20 May 2012|title=BEFOREL OREL – A Moral Orel special that sheds light on the origin of Orel’s religious nature and the birth of Shapey.

==Home releases==
On April 24, 2007, ''Volume One: The Unholy Edition'' was released, which included the first 15 episodes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/27802/moral-orel-vol-1-the-unholy-edition/ |title=Moral Orel, Vol. 1, The Unholy Edition |publisher=[[DVDTalk]] |date=April 28, 2007 |access-date=2016-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and which covered all of the first season and the first five episodes of the second season. This has been the only release in the US, which was later included as part of the ''Adult Swim in a Box'' set in 2009. In October 2007, [[Madman Entertainment]] released a similar volume one set in Australia. Starting in 2010, Madman continued releasing the series, starting with a second volume which included the rest of the second season, and then a third volume which included all of the third season. Then, they released the ''Complete Lessons Collection'', which compiled the discs from the previously released volumes.

The '''National Unity of Hope''' ({{lang-es|Unidad Nacional de la Esperanza}}, UNE) is a [[political party]] in [[Guatemala]]. It was founded in 2002 and defines itself as a [[Social democracy|social-democratic]] and [[Christian socialism|social-Christian]] party.

In the [[legislative]] [[elections in Guatemala|elections]] held on 9 November 2003, the party won 17.9% of the popular vote and 32 out of 158 seats in [[Congress of Guatemala|Congress]]. Its presidential candidate [[Álvaro Colom]] won 26.4% in the presidential elections on the same day and was defeated in the second round, when he received 45.9%.

For the [[Guatemalan general election, 2007|2007 elections]], the party again chose Colom as its presidential candidate. He came in first place with 28% of the vote; the party won 22.8% of the vote and 48 seats in Congress, more than any other party. On 4 November 2007, in the second round of the election, Colom was elected [[President of Guatemala]].  It would mark the first time since 1954 that Guatemala had a left wing government.&lt;ref name=upppavg /&gt;

In the 2011 general election, the Constitutional Court ruled out the candidacy of Colom's ex-wife, [[Sandra Torres (politician)|Sandra Torres]], thus making it the first time in the history of the elections that an official ruling party did not present presidential and vice-presidential candidacies.

According to the [[Book of Mormon]], '''Omner''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɒ|m|n|ər}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/pronunciation?lang=eng LDS.org: "Book of Mormon Pronunciation Guide"] (retrieved 2012-02-25), [[Wikipedia:IPA for English|IPA]]-ified from «äm´ner»&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Nephite]] missionary and one of the sons of [[King Mosiah I|King Mosiah]].  He was also brother to the prophet [[Ammon (Book of Mormon)|Ammon]].  As related in the Book of Mormon narrative, Omner and his three brothers (Ammon, [[Aaron (Nephite)|Aaron]], and [[Himni]]), left their father, and his people, to travel to the land of the [[Lamanites]] in order to preach the gospel to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Alma|chapter=17|verse=6-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During their sojourn there, Omner was imprisoned and beaten,&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Alma|chapter=26|verse=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; but eventually aided in the conversion of thousands of Lamanites, who later became the [[Anti-Nephi-Lehi]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Alma|chapter=23|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The beginning and end of the light", "Eternal Light" and "Mother of light" are three possible meanings of the name Omner.{{fact|date=September 2013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6930">'''Pagans in Recovery''' ('''PIR''') is the phrase which is frequently used to describe the collective efforts of [[Neopagan]]s to achieve abstinence or the remission of compulsive/addictive behaviors through [[twelve-step program]]s such as [[Alcoholics Anonymous]], [[Narcotics Anonymous]],  [[Overeaters Anonymous]], [[Al-Anon/Alateen]], etc. These efforts generally focus on modifying or adapting the twelve steps to accommodate the Pagan world-view as well as creating Pagan-friendly twelve step meetings either as part of a pre-existing twelve-step program, or as independent entities.

==History and development==
The term 'Pagans in Recovery' appears to have first been used in a Neopagan newsletter from [[Ohio]] prior to 1989 which was titled "Pagans in Recovery".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sacred-texts.com/bos/bos158.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Isaac Bonewits also used the term in an essay he wrote in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.neopagan.net/PIR.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Why separate from regular [[12-step|twelve-step]] meetings?==
Many [[paganism|Pagans]] are uncomfortable with traditional twelve-step meetings because of the use of Christian prayers, the difficulty in finding supportive sponsors, the assumption that a person's Higher Power is male, etc.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.witchvox.com/va/dt_va.html?a=usxx&amp;c=words&amp;id=4583&lt;/ref&gt; Some Pagans find the 12 steps themselves too reminiscent of Christian theology to be applicable to their belief systems.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.angelfire.com/wi/theosis/aaspirit.html&lt;/ref&gt; Pagans have been "ousted from A.A. meetings or shunned" when members of that A.A. group discovered that they were Pagans.  However this type of conduct would not be approved by A.A. itself as any person who "has a desire to stop drinking" may declare themselves a member of A.A.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.uni-marburg.de/religionswissenschaft/journal/diskus/foltz.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The focus in alternative groups tends to be on tolerance, balance, building better boundaries, healing old wounds, making amends, taking our power back and right action. As a result, these groups tend to be more in tune with [[Pagan]], [[New Age]], [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]], [[humanistic]], [[feminist]], and [[Buddhist]] teachings, as well as with the more progressive versions of the mainstream faiths.
  
Another issue among Pagans in recovery is the one-sided image of addicts, alcoholics, codependents, and survivors of [[dysfunctional families]] portrayed in official 12 Step literature and in the many books published on recovery and dysfunctional family systems since the 1980s.  For example, Kasl and others in the field of addiction have long noted that the classic "Characteristics of Adult Children of Alcoholics"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.drjan.com/13char.html&lt;/ref&gt; and the list known as "The Problem" in ACA&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adultchildren.org/lit/Problem.s&lt;/ref&gt; (which are read at every ACA meeting) focus strongly on "character defects" and do not adequately support the creation or celebration of character strengths, strengths which are often the result of surviving these very systems.

Many twelve-step programs, such as [[Narcotics Anonymous]], have special interest groups, typically meetings specifically geared towards young people, men, women, gays and lesbians, etc.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.na.org/naway/en/naway4-e-4.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Alcoholics Anonymous has also started meetings specifically for [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]]s which accommodate the Native American view of spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.naigso-aa.org/&lt;/ref&gt; Pagans who are recovering alcoholics have started A.A. meetings specifically for Pagans&lt;ref&gt;http://news.earthhousemn.org/index.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1&lt;/ref&gt;

==What is different about recovery programs for Pagans?==
Many Pagans seem to prefer a mutually supportive, spiritually based twelve step approach to recovery&lt;ref&gt;http://health.ivillage.com/mentalhealth/mhaddiction/0,,760v,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; over non-spiritually based programs such as [[Secular Organizations for Sobriety]], where one is expected to keep his or her spiritual beliefs separate from recovery,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cfiwest.org/sos/find.htm&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Rational Recovery]], which is not spiritually based and does not encourage members to seek support from others in recovery.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bookrags.com/other/drugs/rational-recovery-rr-edaa-03.html&lt;/ref&gt; Generally speaking, Pagan twelve step meetings follow the same format as other twelve step meetings except that they use Pagan friendly readings (which have not been approved by the General Service Office of Alcoholics Anonymous or other twelve step organizations), and substitute Pagan friendly prayers for the [[Lord's Prayer]] (which is not AA Conference approved, but widely used) and the [[Serenity Prayer]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jelder.com/Pagan/11SSC_protocol.PDF&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the ''Recovery Spiral: A Pagan Path to Healing'' by Cynthia Jane Collins  is sometimes used instead of or along with the [[The Big Book (Alcoholics Anonymous)|Big Book]] of Alcoholics Anonymous, and the Native American Great Spirit prayer may be substituted for the Lord's Prayer.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rewritables.net/cybriety/recovery_prayers.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Pagan twelve step groups have reworked or reworded the twelve steps so as to make them more applicable to Pagans, especially in allowing for a [[Polytheistic]] and non-gendered view of divinity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.recovery.org/pagan.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The members of Pagan twelve step groups are still expected to work the twelve steps as a means of spiritual growth, obtain a sponsor, make amends for harm they have caused, and to help others.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sacredcenters.com/articles/recovery.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.widdershins.org/vol1iss2/11.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Some twelve step meetings for Pagans are eclectic, meaning that anyone from a twelve step recovery program, regardless of the nature of their addiction, may participate in the meeting. This is in sharp contrast to Alcoholics Anonymous' concept of "Singleness of Purpose" which holds that alcoholics should only work with other alcoholics.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aaprimarypurpose.org/SinglePurpose.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Beatification|Blessed]] '''Pedro María Ramírez Ramos''' (23 October 1899 – 10 April 1948) was a [[Colombian people|Colombian]] [[Priesthood in the Catholic Church|Roman Catholic priest]] killed during the outbreak of the Colombian civil war known as ''[[La Violencia]]''.&lt;ref name=SEB&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.santiebeati.it/dettaglio/97301|title=Beato Pedro María Ramírez Ramos|date=|work=Santi e Beati|accessdate=6 September 2017}}{{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served as the [[pastor]] of [[Armero, Colombia|Armero]], where he was stationed until his murder in 1948. The outbreak of the conflict saw families offer to smuggle him out of the town for his safety, which he refused, saying that he would not abandon his people in their hour of need. But liberal insurgents – who saw him as an instigator of the assassination of a leading national politician – burst into his church and took him to the central square where he was [[lynched]] and mutilated.&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt;&lt;ref name=CN&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://cruxnow.com/global-church/2017/07/09/pope-beatify-colombian-martyrs-visit/|title=Pope to beatify Colombian martyrs during visit|publisher=Crux Now|author=Junno Arocho Esteves|date=9 July 2017|accessdate=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ZN&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://zenit.org/articles/colombia-the-pope-will-beatify-two-martyrs-a-bishop-and-a-priest/|title=Colombia: The Pope Will Beatify Two Martyrs, a Bishop and a Priest|date=7 July 2017|author=Anne Kurian|publisher=Zenit|accessdate=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cause for Ramírez' [[canonization]] was opened in 1993. His beatification was approved in July 2017 by [[Pope Francis]],&lt;ref name=CN/&gt;&lt;ref name=ZN/&gt; who personally presided over his beatification in [[Villavicencio]] on 8 September 2017 during his apostolic visit to the nation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/pope-francis-beatifies-two-colombian-martyrs-24076/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Ramírez was born on 23 October 1899 in [[La Plata, Huila|La Plata]] to Ramón Ramírez Flórez and Isabel Ramos. He was [[baptized]] the next day in the local [[Parish Church]] of [[St. Sebastian]].&lt;ref name=DG&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.diocesisgarzon.com/aproximacion-biografica|title=Síntesis Biográfica del Padre Pedro María Ramírez Ramos|date=|publisher=Diocese of Garzón|accessdate=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was at that church that he also made his [[First Communion]].

Ramírez' initial education was overseen in his local village. He attended high school at the [[Minor Seminary]] of St. [[Aloysius Gonzaga]] in [[Elias, Huila]].&lt;ref name=CN/&gt; He commenced his formal studies for the priesthood on 4 October 1915 at the seminary of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Garzón|Diocese of Garzón]], where he received [[minor orders]] in 1917.&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt; Ramirez developed doubts about his vocation, however, and decided to leave the seminary in 1920, seeking an answer to his vocational calling and relief from the frequent headaches from he suffered. He spent the subsequent years working as a choir director in various locations, initially at his former high school, and from 1924 at the village of [[Alpujarra, Tolima]]. Through a close and personal relationship with a pious young woman he came to know there, by 1928 he had reassessed his call to serve God and resumed his theological studies, this time at the Seminary of Mary Immaculate of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Ibagué|Diocese of Ibagué]], for which he was [[Holy Orders|ordained]] as a priest on 21 June 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://arquidiocesisdeibague.org/servicios/noticias/1528-el-beato-pedro-maria-ramirez?highlight=WyJwZWRybyIsInJhbVx1MDBlZHJleiJd|work=Arqudiócesis de Igabué|title=El Beato Pedro María Ramírez|author=Mario García Isaza, [[Congregation of the Mission|C.M.]]|date=5 August 2017}}{{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He celebrated his [[First Mass]] at his home parish in St. Sebastian Church on the following 16 July.&lt;ref name=ZN/&gt;&lt;ref name=DG/&gt;

After Ramírez' ordination, his superior, Pedro María Rodríguez Andrade, the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Ibagué|Bishop of Ibagué]], appointed him as the pastor of [[Chaparral]] before transferring him to [[Cunday]] in 1934 and later to [[El Fresno]] in 1943. He was sent to his final parish of [[Armero, Colombia|Armero]] circa 1948.&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt;&lt;ref name=CN/&gt;

On 9 April 1948, Ramírez was visiting a patient in the local hospital when the news broke of the assassination of the presidential candidate of the [[Colombian Liberal Party]], [[Jorge Eliécer Gaitán]]. Ramírez was under the threat of death himself by that afternoon as members of the Liberal Party believed he had instigated the murder.&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt; A Sister Miguelina of the [[Mercedarian|Mercedarian Sisters]] of the [[Blessed Sacrament]] who taught at the local school tried to help him and this bought him some time. Some families offered to help him flee during the night so he could remain safe, though the priest refused the offers, refusing to abandon his people during their time of need.&lt;ref name=ZN/&gt;

During the afternoon on 10 April 1948 a large throng of people broke into the church not long after Ramírez had written his last will, believing that his final hour was at hand. Insurgents burst into the church and convent, accusing him of hiding weapons for the conservatives. His attackers took him to the central square (hurling insults at him en route) where he was [[lynched]] at 4:00pm and struck with a [[machete]].&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt;&lt;ref name=CN/&gt;&lt;ref name=ZN/&gt; His remains were left in the square for a few hours until midnight when his corpse was taken to the local cemetery where it was left in a ditch while refusing the faithful from going near his remains for burial. On 21 April government officials arrived and authorized an [[autopsy]]. A month later his parents were able to claim his remains, which they first had taken to his ''[[alma mater]]'', Mary Immaculate Seminary in Igabué, after which they were buried in the family plot in La Plata.&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt;

==Veneration==
The cause for the canonization was opened in the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Garzón|Diocese of Garzón]] whereby the bishop of the diocese charged a diocesan tribunal with the collection of documents and testimonies related to Ramírez' life and his murder. The conclusion of this diocesan process saw the diocese send all documents to the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]] of the [[Holy See]], which accepted the cause for further study on 23 February 1993, which accorded Ramírez the title of [[Servant of God]].

The congregation validated this process under [[Pope John Paul II]] on 1 March 2002, after assessing the documents and approving the investigation's work and issued an official "''[[nihil obstat]]''" ("Let nothing stand against [it]") to the cause. Historians were assigned to discuss the cause and cleared it on 11 December 2012, after deeming that no historical obstacles existed that would impede it. The congregation then submitted the ''[[positio]]'' for theological assessment. The theological experts approved the dossier on 28 May 2016, as did the congregation sometime in mid-2017.

On 7 July 2017, [[Pope Francis]] approved the work of the congregation with its declaration that Ramírez had been killed "''in odium fidei''" (in hatred of the faith) and that he would soon be beatified along with his compatriot, Bishop [[Jesús Emilio Jaramillo Monsalve]] executed by leftist guerillas in 1950. The pope himself presided over the beatification in [[Villavicencio]] on 8 September 2017, during his apostolic visit to Colombia.&lt;ref name=CN/&gt;&lt;ref name=ZN/&gt; Ramírez's remains were exhumed and transferred on 24 August 2017.

The current [[postulator]] for this cause is the [[Trinitarian Order|Trinitarian]] [[friar]] Antonio Sáez de Albéniz, O.Ss.T.

===Controversy===
When the decision to beatify Ramírez was first announced, a protest against it was issued to Pope Francis by the daughter of the politician whose murder had precipitated his. In her letter to the pope, the daughter, Gloria Gaitán, questioned this step by the Catholic Church, citing how the priest had openly called for her father's death, declaring in the pulpit that to kill him would not be a sin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.las2orillas.co/el-cura-que-beatificaran-decia-que-mi-papa-habia-que-matarlo-para-que-se-fuera-al-infierno-gloria-gaitan/|work=Las 2 Orillas|title="El cura que beatificarán decía que mi papá había que matarlo para que se fuera al infierno", Gloria Gaitán|date=9 July 2017}}{{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beatification==
[[Pope Francis]] approved the cause on 7 July 2017 and thus approved the late priest's beatification.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2017/07/07/pope_francis_approves_decrees_for_miracles,_martyrdom/1323750|title=Pope to beatify a bishop and a priest in Colombia|date=7 July 2017|publisher=[[Vatican Radio]]|accessdate=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Francis himself presided over the beatification during his papal visit to Colombia at an open-air Mass on 8 September 2017 at Catama Field in [[Villavicencio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/pope-francis-beatifies-two-colombian-martyrs-24076/|title=Pope to beatify a bishop and a priest in Colombia|date=8 September 2017|publisher=[[Catholic News Agency]]|accessdate=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2017/07/11/pope_to_beatify_a_bishop_and_a_priest_in_Colombia_/1324426|title=Pope to beatify a bishop and a priest in Colombia|date=11 July 2017|publisher=[[Vatican Radio]]|accessdate=12 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Persian carpet''' ({{lang-fa|فرش ايرانى}} ''farsh'', meaning "to spread") or '''Persian rug''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: قالی ايرانى ''qālī-ye īranī''),&lt;ref name="Savory, R."&gt;Savory, R., ''Carpets'',([[Encyclopaedia Iranica]]); accessed January 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''Iranian carpet''', is a heavy textile, made for a wide variety of utilitarian and symbolic purpose, produced in [[Iran]] (historically known as [[Name of Iran|Persia]]), for home use, local sale, and export. Carpet weaving is an essential part of [[Persian culture]] and [[Iranian art]]. Within the group of [[Oriental rug]]s produced by the countries of the so-called '''"rug belt"''', the Persian carpet stands out by the variety and elaborateness of its manifold designs.

Persian carpets and rugs of various types were woven in parallel by nomadic tribes, in village and town workshops, and by royal court manufactories alike. As such, they represent different, simultaneous lines of tradition, and reflect the [[history of Iran]] and its various peoples. The carpets woven in the [[Safavid Empire|Safavid]] court manufactories of [[Isfahan]] during the sixteenth century are famous for their elaborate colours and artistical design, and are treasured in museums and private collections all over the world today. Their patterns and designs have set an artistic tradition for court manufactories which was kept alive during the entire duration of the Persian Empire up to the last royal dynasty of Iran.

Carpets woven in towns and regional centers like [[Tabriz rug|Tabriz]], [[Kerman carpet|Kerman]], [[Mashhad]], [[Kashan]], [[Isfahan rug|Isfahan]], [[Nain rug|Nain]] and [[Qom rug|Qom]] are characterized by their specific weaving techniques and use of high-quality materials, colours and patterns. Town manufactories like those of [[Tabriz]] have played an important historical role in reviving the tradition of carpet weaving after periods of decline. Rugs woven by the villages and various tribes of Iran are distinguished by their fine wool, bright and elaborate colours, and specific, traditional patterns. Nomadic and small village weavers often produce rugs with bolder and sometimes more coarse designs, which are considered as the most authentic and traditional rugs of Persia, as opposed to the artistic, pre-planned designs of the larger workplaces. [[Gabbeh]] rugs are the best-known type of carpet from this line of tradition.

The art and craft of carpet weaving has gone through periods of decline during times of political unrest, or under the influence of commercial demands. It particularly suffered from the introduction of synthetic dyes during the second half of the nineteenth century. Carpet weaving still plays a major part in the economy of modern Iran. Modern production is characterized by the revival of traditional dyeing with [[natural dye]]s, the reintroduction of traditional tribal patterns, but also by the invention of modern and innovative designs, woven in the centuries-old technique. Hand-woven Persian carpets and rugs have been regarded as objects of high artistic and utilitarian value and prestige since the first time they were mentioned by ancient Greek writers.

Although the term "Persian carpet" most often refers to pile-woven textiles, flat-woven carpets and rugs like [[Kilim]], [[Soumak rug|Soumak]], and embroidered tissues like [[Suzani (textile)|Suzani]] are part of the rich and manifold tradition of Persian carpet weaving.

In 2010, the "traditional skills of carpet weaving" in [[Fars Province]] and [[Kashan rug|Kashan]] were inscribed to the [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/en/RL/00382|accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/en/RL/00383|accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The beginning of carpet weaving remains unknown, as carpets are subject to use, deterioration, and destruction by insects and rodents. Woven rugs probably developed from earlier floor coverings, made of '''[[felt]]''', or a technique known as "'''flat weaving'''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pinner|first1=R.|title=The First Carpets|journal=Hali|date=1983|volume=5|issue=2|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flat-woven rugs are made by tightly interweaving the [[warp and weft]] strands of the weave to produce a flat surface with no pile. The technique of weaving carpets further developed into a technique known as '''loop weaving'''. Loop weaving is done by pulling the weft strings over a gauge rod, creating loops of thread facing the weaver. The rod is then either removed, leaving the loops closed, or the loops are cut over the protecting rod, resulting in a rug very similar to a genuine [[pile rug]]. Hand-woven pile rugs are produced by knotting strings of thread individually into the warps, cutting the [[pile (textile)|thread]] after each single knot.

=== The Pazyryk carpet: Earliest pile-woven carpet ===
[[File:Pazyryk carpet.jpg|thumb|The [[Pazyryk burials#Pazyryk carpet|Pazyryk Carpet]]. Circa 400 BC. [[Hermitage Museum]]]]

The [[Pazyryk culture|Pazyryk]] carpet was excavated in 1949 from the grave of a [[Scythia]]n nobleman in the Pazyryk Valley of the [[Altai Mountains]] in [[Siberia]]. Radiocarbon testing indicated that the Pazyryk carpet was woven in the 5th century BC.&lt;ref name="Haider, R."&gt;Haider, R., ''Carpet that Captive''&lt;/ref&gt; This carpet is {{convert|183|x|200|cm|abbr=off}} and has 36 symmetrical [[knot density|knots per]] cm² (232 per inch²).&lt;ref&gt;Nouri-Zadeh, Sh., ''Turkish Carpet; The Beautiful Picture of Art in History'',&lt;/ref&gt; The advanced technique used in the Pazyryk carpet indicates a long history of evolution and experience in weaving. It is considered the oldest known carpet in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Rubinson, Karen S., ''"Animal Style" Art &amp; the Image of the Horse and Rider''&lt;/ref&gt; Its central field is a deep red color and it has two animal frieze borders proceeding in opposite directions accompanied by guard stripes. The inner main border depicts a procession of deer, the outer men on horses, and men leading horses. The horse saddlecloths are woven in different designs. The inner field contains 4 x 6 identical square frames arranged in rows on a red ground, each filled by identical, star shaped ornaments made up by centrally overlapping x- and cross-shaped patterns. The design of the carpet already shows the basic arrangement of what was to become the standard oriental carpet design: A field with repeating patterns, framed by a main border in elaborate design, and several secondary borders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=ḎḤWTY|title=2,500-Year-Old Carpet is Stunning Reflection of Advanced Culture of the Pazyryk Nomads|url=http://www.ancient-origins.net/artifacts-other-artifacts/2500-year-old-carpet-stunning-reflection-advanced-culture-pazyryk-nomads-021858|website=Ancient Origins|accessdate=31 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discoverer of the Pazyryk carpet, [[Sergei Rudenko]], assumed it to be a product of the contemporary [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenids]].&lt;ref&gt;S.I. Rudenko, ''Kul'tura naseleniia Gornogo Altaia v skifskoe vremia'' (Moscow and Leningrad, 1953)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rudenko, Sergei I., Frozen Tombs of Siberia, The Pazyryk Burials of Iron-Age Horseman (University of California Press, Berkeley and Los Angeles, California, 1970)&lt;/ref&gt;  Whether it was produced in the region where it was found, or is a product of Achaemenid manufacture, remains subject to debate.&lt;ref&gt;Lerner J., ''Some So-called Achaemenid Objects from Pazyryk'', Source: Notes in the History of Art, vol. 10, no. 4:8-15 (1991).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harald Böhmer and Jon Thompson, ''The Pazyryk Carpet: A Technical Discussion'', Source: Notes in the History of Art, vol. 10, no. 4:30-36 (1991).&lt;/ref&gt; Its fine weaving and elaborate pictorial design hint at an advanced state of the art of carpet weaving at the time of its production.

=== Early fragments ===
There are documentary records of carpets being used by the ancient Greeks. [[Homer]], assumed to have lived around 850 BC, writes in [[Ilias]] XVII,350 that the body of Patroklos is covered with a "splendid carpet". In [[Odyssey]] Book VII and X "carpets" are mentioned. [[Pliny the Elder]] wrote ([[Natural History (Pliny)|nat. VIII, 48]]) that carpets ("polymita") were invented in Alexandria. It is unknown whether these were flatweaves or pile weaves, as no detailed technical information is provided in the Greek and Latin texts.

Flat-woven [[kilim]]s dating to at least the fourth or fifth century AD were found in [[Turfan]], [[Hotan|Hotan prefecture]], East Turkestan, China, an area which still produces carpets today. Rug fragments were also found in the [[Lop Nur]] area, and are woven in symmetrical knots, with 5-7 interwoven wefts after each row of knots, with a striped design, and various colours. They are now in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.&lt;ref name="Spuhler Carpets Islamic Museum Berlin"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spuhler|first1=Friedrich|title=Die Orientteppiche im Museum für Islamische Kunst Berlin|date=1987|publisher=Klinkhardt and Biermann|location=Munich|isbn=3-7814-0270-3|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other fragments woven in symmetrical as well as asymmetrical knots have been found in [[Dura-Europos]] in [[Syria]],&lt;ref name="Dura-Europos"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pfister|first1=R.|last2=Bellinger|first2=L.|title=The Excavations at Dura-Europos; IV Vol. 2 The Textiles|date=1945|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from the At-Tar caves in [[Iraq]],&lt;ref name="At-Tar"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fujii|first1=Hideo|last2=Sakamoto|first2=Kazuko|editor1-last=Eiland|editor1-first=M.L.|title=The marked characteristics of carpets unearthed from the At-Tar caves, Iraq|journal=Oriental Carpet and Textile Studies|date=1993|volume=IV|pages=35–40|location=Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt; dated to the first centuries AD.

These rare findings demonstrate that all the skills and techniques of dyeing and carpet weaving were already known in western Asia before the first century AD.

=== Early history: circa 500 BC – 200 AD ===
Persian carpets were first mentioned around 400 BC, by the Greek author [[Xenophon]] in his book "[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]":

&lt;blockquote&gt;"αὖθις δὲ Τιμασίωνι τῷ Δαρδανεῖ προσελθών, ἐπεὶ ἤκουσεν αὐτῷ εἶναι καὶ ἐκπώματα καὶ τάπιδας βαρβαρικάς", (Xen. anab. VII.3.18)
: ''Next he went to Timasion the Dardanian, for he heard that he had some Persian drinking cups and carpets.''
"καὶ Τιμασίων προπίνων ἐδωρήσατο φιάλην τε ἀργυρᾶν καὶ τάπιδα ἀξίαν δέκα μνῶν." [Xen. anab. VII.3.27]
: ''Timasion also drank his health and presented him with a silver bowl and a carpet worth ten mines.''&lt;ref&gt;[[:s:Κύρου Ανάβασις/Ζ|Κύρου Ανάβασις/Ζ]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Xenophon describes Persian (lit.: "barbarian", meaning: non-Greek) carpets as precious, and worthy to be used as diplomatic gifts. It is unknown if these carpets were pile-woven, or produced by another technique, e.g., [[kilim|flat-weaving]], or [[embroidery]], but it is interesting that the very first reference to Persian carpets in the world literature already puts them into a context of luxury, prestige, and diplomacy.

There are no surviving Persian carpets from the reigns of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenian]] (553–330 BC), [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] (312–129 BC), and [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] (ca. 170 BC – 226 AD) kings.

=== The Sasanian Empire: 224–651 ===

The [[Sasanian Empire]], which succeeded the [[Parthian Empire]], was recognized as one of the leading powers of its time, alongside its neighbouring [[Byzantine Empire]], for a period of more than 400 years.&lt;ref&gt;International Congress of Byzantine Studies ''Proceedings of the 21st International Congress of Byzantine Studies, London, 21–26 August 2006, Volumes 1–3'' pp 29. Ashgate Pub Co, 30 sep. 2006 {{ISBN|075465740X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sasanids established their empire roughly within the borders set by the Achaemenids, with the capital at [[Ctesiphon]]. This last Persian dynasty before the arrival of [[Islam]] adopted [[Zoroastrianism]] as the state religion.

When and how exactly the Persians started weaving pile carpets is currently unknown, but the knowledge of carpet weaving, and of suitable designs for floor coverings, was certainly available in the area covering Byzance, Anatolia, and Persia: [[History of Anatolia|Anatolia]], located between Byzance and Persia, was ruled by the Roman Empire since 133 BCE. Geographically and politically, by changing alliances and warfare as well as by trade, Anatolia connected the East Roman with the Persian Empire. Artistically, both empires have developed similar styles and decorative vocabulary, as exemplified by mosaics and architecture of Roman [[Antioch]].&lt;ref name="Masterpieces Islamic Art, 2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ekthiar|first1=MD|last2=Soucek|first2=PP|last3=Canby|first3=SR|last4=Haidar|first4=NN|title=Masterpieces from the Department of Islamic Art in the Metropolitan Museum of Art|date=2012|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-58839-434-7|pages=20–24|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Turkish carpet pattern depicted on [[Jan van Eyck]]'s [[Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele|"Paele Madonna"]] painting was traced back to late Roman origins and related to early Islamic floor mosaics found in the Umayyad palace of [[Hisham's Palace|Khirbat al-Mafjar]].&lt;ref name="Brüggemann, Orientteppich 2007"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brüggemann|first1=Werner|title=Der Orientteppich/The Oriental Carpet|date=2007|publisher=Dr Ludwig Reichert Verlag|location=Wiesbaden, Germany|isbn=978-3-89500-563-3|pages=87–176|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flat weaving and embroidery were known during the Sasanian period. Elaborate Sasanian silk textiles were well preserved in European churches, where they were used as coverings for relics, and survived in church treasuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=N. (no author)|first1=N.|title=Splendeur des Sassanides: L'empire Perse entre Rome et la Chine (224-642) / the Splendor of the Sassanians: the Persian Empire between Rome and China (224-642)|date=1993|publisher=Credit Communal|location=Brussels}}&lt;/ref&gt; More of these textiles were preserved in Tibetan monasteries, and were removed by monks fleeing to Nepal during the [[Chinese cultural revolution]], or excavated from burial sites like Astana, on the [[Silk Road]] near [[Turpan|Turfan]]. The high artistic level reached by Persian weavers is further exemplified by the report of the historian [[Al-Tabari]] about the [[Baharestan Carpet|Spring of Khosrow]] carpet, taken as booty by the Arabian conquerors of Ctesiphon in 637 AD. The description of the rug's design by al-Tabari makes it seem unlikely that the carpet was pile woven.&lt;ref name="Antique Rugs from the Near East"&gt;{{cite book|last1=von Bode|first1=Wilhelm|last2=Kühnel|first2=Ernst|title=Vorderasiatische Knüpfteppiche = Antique Rugs from the Near East, tr.

Fragments of pile rugs from findspots in north-eastern [[Afghanistan]], reportedly originating from the province of [[Samangan Province|Samangan]], have been carbon-14 dated to a time span from the turn of the second century to the early Sasanian period. Among these fragments, some show depictions of animals, like various stags (sometimes arranged in a procession, recalling the design of the Pazyryk carpet) or a winged mythical creature. Wool is used for warp, weft, and pile, the yarn is crudely spun, and the fragments are woven with the asymmetric knot associated with Persian and far-eastern carpets. Every three to five rows, pieces of unspun wool, strips of cloth and leather are woven in.&lt;ref name="Carpets from Islamic Lands"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spuhler|first1=Friedrich|title=Carpets from Islamic Lands|date=2012|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|location=London|isbn=978-0-500-97043-0|pages=14–19|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; These fragments are now in the [[House of Sabah|Al-Sabah]] Collection in the [[Dar al-Athar al-Islamiyyah]], [[Kuwait]].&lt;ref name="darmuseum.org.kw"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kuwait Dar al-Athar al-Islamiyyah rugs and textiles collection|url=http://darmuseum.org.kw/the-collections/rugs-textiles/|website=Dar al-Athar al-Islamiyyah|accessdate=25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The carpet fragments, although reliably dated to the early Sasanian time, do not seem to be related to the splendid court carpets described by the Arab conquerors. Their crude knots incorporating [[Shag (fabric)|shag]] on the reverse hints at the need for increased insulation. With their coarsely finished animal and hunting depictions, these carpets were likely woven by nomadic people.&lt;ref name="Spuhler, Pre-Islamic carpets 2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spuhler|first1=Friedrich|title=Pre-Islamic carpets and textiles from eastern lands.|date=2013|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd.|location=Farnborough|isbn=9780500970546|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The advent of Islam and the Caliphates: 651–1258 ===
The [[Muslim conquest of Persia]] led to the end of the Sasanian Empire in 651 and the eventual decline of the Zoroastrian religion in Persia. Persia became a part of the Islamic world, ruled by Muslim [[Caliphate]]s.

Arabian geographers and historians visiting Persia provide, for the first time, references to the use of carpets on the floor. The unknown author of the [[Hudud al-'Alam]] states that rugs were woven in Fārs. 100 years later, [[Al-Muqaddasi]] refers to carpets in the Qaināt. [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]] tells us that carpets were woven in [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Azerbaijān]] in the thirteenth century. The great Arabian traveller [[Ibn Battuta]] mentions that a green rug was spread before him when he visited the winter quarter of the Bakhthiari [[atabeg]] in [[Izeh|Idhej]]. These references indicate that carpet weaving in Persia under the Caliphate was a tribal or rural industry.&lt;ref name="Edwards, 1952"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=A. Cecil|title=The Persian carpet : a survey of the carpet-weaving industry of Persia|date=1975|publisher=Duckworth|location=London|isbn=978-0715602560|edition=Reprinted 1952}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rule of the Caliphs over Persia ended when the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] was overthrown in the [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)]] by the [[Mongol Empire]] under [[Hulagu Khan]]. The Abbasid line of rulers recentered themselves in the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk]] capital of [[Cairo]] in 1261. Though lacking in political power, the dynasty continued to claim authority in religious matters until after the [[Ottoman dynasty|Ottoman]] [[Ottoman–Mamluk War (1516–17)|conquest of Egypt]] (1517). Under the Mamluk dynasty in Cairo, large carpets known as "Mamluk carpets" were produced.&lt;ref name="Erdmann, Mamluks"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Erdmann|first1=Kurt|title=Kairener Teppiche Teil I.

=== Seljuq invasion and Turko-Persian tradition: 1040–1118 ===
{{see also|Turkish carpet}}

Beginning at latest with the [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuq]] invasions of Anatolia and northwestern Persia, a distinct [[Turko-Persian tradition]] emerged. Fragments of woven carpets were found in the [[Alâeddin Mosque]] in the Turkish town of [[Konya]] and the [[Eşrefoğlu Mosque]] in [[Beyşehir]], and were dated to the Anatolian Seljuq Period (1243–1302).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=F.R.|title=A History of Oriental Carpets before 1800|date=1908|publisher=Printed for the author in the I. and R.

The Egyptian findings also provide evidence for export trade. If, and how, these carpets influenced Persian carpet weaving, remains unknown, as no distinct Persian carpets are known to exist from this period, or we are unable to identify them. It was assumed by Western scholars that the Sejuqs may have introduced at least new design traditions, if not the craft of pile weaving itself, to Persia, where skilled artisans and craftsmen might have integrated new ideas into their old traditions.&lt;ref name="Antique Rugs from the Near East"/&gt;

=== The Mongol Ilkhanate (1256–1335) and Timurid Empire (1370–1507) ===
[[File:DiezAlbumsStudyingTheKoran.jpg|thumb|A Mongol prince studying the Koran. Illustration of Rashid-ad-Din's Gami' at-tawarih. Tabriz (?), 1st quarter of 14th century]]
Between 1219 and 1221, Persia was raided by the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]]. After 1260, the title [[Ilkhanate|"Ilkhan"]] was borne by the descendants of [[Hulagu Khan]] and later other Borjigin princes in Persia. At the end of the thirteenth century, [[Ghazan]] Khan built a new capital at Shãm, near Tabriz. He ordered the floors of his residence to be covered with carpets from Fārs.&lt;ref name="Edwards, 1952"/&gt;

With the death of Ilkhan Abu Said Bahatur in 1335, Mongol rule faltered and Persia fell into political anarchy. In 1381, [[Timur]] invaded Iran and became the founder of the [[Timurid Empire]]. His successors, the Timurids, maintained a hold on most of Iran until they had to submit to the [[Ag Qoyunlu|"White Sheep" Turkmen]] confederation under [[Uzun Hassan]] in 1468; Uzun Hasan and his successors were the masters of Iran until the rise of the Safavids.

In 1463, the Venetian Senate, seeking allies in the [[Ottoman–Venetian War (1463–1479)]] established diplomatic relations with Uzun Hassans court at Tabriz. In 1473, [[Giosafat Barbaro]] was sent to Tabriz. In his reports to the Senate of Venetia he mentions more than once the splendid carpets which he saw at the palace. Some of them, he wrote, were of silk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=Lettere%20al%20senato%20veneto%20annotate%20per%20E.%20Cornet%20giosafat%20barbaro|title=Worldcat|accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1403-05 [[Ruy González de Clavijo]] was the ambassador of [[Henry III of Castile]] to the court of [[Timur]], founder and ruler of the [[Timurid Empire]]. He described that in Timur's palace at [[Samarkand]], "everywhere the floor was covered with carpets and reed mattings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=de Clavijo|first1=Ruy Gonzáles|editor1-last=Le Strange|editor1-first=Guy|title=Embassy to Tamerlane, 1403-1406|date=2009|publisher=Hardinge Simpole|location=Kilkerran|isbn=978-1843821984}}&lt;/ref&gt; Timurid period miniatures show carpets with geometrical designs, rows of octagons and stars, knot forms, and borders sometimes derived from [[kufic]] script. None of the carpets woven before 1500 AD have survived.&lt;ref name="Edwards, 1952"/&gt;

=== The Safavid Period (1501–1732) ===

In 1499, a new dynasty arose in Persia. Shah [[Ismail I]], its founder, was related to Uzun Hassan. He is regarded as the first national sovereign of Persia since the Arab conquest, and established [[Shia Islam|Shi'a Islam]] as the state religion of Persia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Savory|first1=Roger|title=Iran under the Safavids|date=2007|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|location=Cambridge [u.a.]|isbn=978-0521042512|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and his successors, Shah [[Tahmasp I]] and Shah [[Abbas I of Persia|Abbas I]] became patrons of the Persian [[Safavid art]]. Court manufactories were probably established by Shah Tahmasp in Tabriz, but definitely by Shah Abbas when he moved his capital from Tabriz in northwestern to [[Isfahan]] in central Persia, in the wake of the [[Ottoman–Safavid War (1603–18)]]. For the art of carpet weaving in Persia, this meant, as Edwards wrote: "that in a short time it rose from a cottage ''métier'' to the dignity of a fine art."&lt;ref name="Edwards, 1952"/&gt;

The time of the [[Safavid dynasty]] marks one of the greatest periods in [[Iranian art|Persian art]], which includes carpet weaving. Later Safavid period carpets still exist, which belong to the finest and most elaborate weavings known today. The phenomenon that the first carpets physically known to us show such accomplished designs leads to the assumption that the art and craft of carpet weaving must already have existed for some time before the magnificent Safavid court carpets could have been woven. As no early Safavid period carpets survived, research has focused on Timurid period book illuminations and [[Persian miniature|miniature]] paintings. These paintings depict colourful carpets with repeating designs of equal-scale geometric patterns, arranged in checkerboard-like designs, with "kufic" border ornaments derived from [[Islamic calligraphy]]. The designs are so similar to period Anatolian carpets, especially to "[[Holbein carpet]]s" that a common source of the design cannot be excluded: Timurid designs may have survived in both the Persian and Anatolian carpets from the early Safavid, and Ottoman period.&lt;ref name="Briggs, Timurid carpets"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Briggs|first1=Amy|title=Timurid Carpets; I. Geometric carpets|journal=Ars Islamica|date=1940|volume=7|pages=20–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The "design revolution" ====
By the late fifteenth century, the design of the carpets depicted in miniatures changed considerably. Large-format medaillons appeared, ornaments began to show elaborate curvilinear designs. Large spirals and tendrils, floral ornaments, depictions of flowers and animals, were often mirrored along the long or short axis of the carpet to obtain harmony and rhythm. The earlier "kufic" border design was replaced by tendrils and [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesques]]. All these patterns required a more elaborate system of weaving, as compared to weaving straight, rectilinear lines. Likewise, they require artists to create the design, weavers to execute them on the loom, and an efficient way to communicate the artist's ideas to the weaver. Today this is achieved by a template, termed cartoon (Ford, 1981, p.&amp;nbsp;170&lt;ref name="Ford, Oriental Carpet Design"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ford|first1=P.R.J.|title=Oriental Carpet Design|date=1981|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd.|location=London|isbn=9780500276648|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;). How Safavid manufacturers achieved this, technically, is currently unknown. The result of their work, however, was what [[Kurt Erdmann]] termed the '''"carpet design revolution"'''.&lt;ref name="Erdmann"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erdmann|first1=Kurt|title=Der Orientalische Knüpfteppich. tr. C. G. Ellis as Oriental Carpets: An Essay on Their History, New York, 1960.|date=1965|publisher=Verlag Ernst Wasmuth|location=Tübingen|pages=30–32|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apparently, the new designs were developed first by miniature painters, as they started to appear in book illuminations and on book covers as early as in the fifteenth century. This marks the first time when the "classical" design of Islamic rugs was established: The medaillon and corner design (pers.: "Lechek Torūnj") was first seen on book covers. In 1522, Ismail I employed the miniature painter [[Kamāl ud-Dīn Behzād]], a famous painter of the Herat school, as director of the royal atelier. Behzad had a decisive impact on the development of later Safavid art. The Safavid carpets known to us differ from the carpets as depicted in the miniature paintings, so the paintings cannot support any efforts to differentiate, classify and date period carpets. The same holds true for European paintings: Unlike Anatolian carpets, Persian carpets were not depicted in European paintings before the seventeenth century.&lt;ref name="Erdmann 1966"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erdmann|first1=Kurt|editor1-last=Erdmann|editor1-first=Hanna|editor2-last=Beattie (transl.)|editor2-first=May H.|title=Seven hundred years of Oriental carpets.|date=1970|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0520018167}}&lt;/ref&gt; As some carpets like the [[Ardabil carpet]]s have inwoven inscriptions including dates, scientific efforts to categorize and date Safavid rugs start from them:

{{Quotation|&lt;blockquote&gt;I have no refuge in the world other than thy threshold.&lt;br/&gt;There is no protection for my head other than this door.''&lt;br/&gt;''The work of the slave of the threshold Maqsud of Kashan in the year 946.&lt;/blockquote&gt; |''Inwoven inscription of the Ardabil carpet''}}

The AH year of 946 corresponds to AD 1539-40, which dates the Ardabil carpet to the reign of Shah Tahmasp, who donated the carpet to the shrine of Shaykh [[Safi-ad-din Ardabili]] in [[Ardabil]], who is regarded as the spiritual father of the Safavid dynasty.

Another inscription can be seen on the "Hunting Carpet", now at the [[Museo Poldi Pezzoli]], Milan, which dates the carpet to 949 AH/AD 1542–3:

{{Quotation|&lt;blockquote&gt;By the diligence of Ghyath ud-Din Jami was completed&lt;br/&gt;This renowned work, that appeals to us by its beauty&lt;br/&gt;In the year 949&lt;/blockquote&gt; |''Inwoven inscription of the Milan Hunting carpet''}}

[[File:Embassy to Europe.jpg|thumb|Shah 'Abbas I. embassy to Venice, by [[Carlo Caliari]], 1595. Doge's palace, Venice]]

The number of sources for more precise dating and the attribution of provenience increase during the 17th century. Safavid carpets were presented as diplomatic gifts to European cities and states, as diplomatic relations intensified. In 1603, Shah Abbas presented a carpet with inwoven gold and silver threads to the Venetian doge [[Marino Grimani (doge)|Marino Grimani]]. European noblemen began ordering carpets directly from the manufactures of Isfahan and Kashan, whose weavers were willing to weave specific designs, like European coats of arms, into the commissioned peces. Their acquisition was sometimes meticulously documented: In 1601, the [[Armenia]]n Sefer Muratowicz was sent to Kashan by the Polish king [[Sigismund III Vasa]] in order to commission 8 carpets with the Polish royal court of arms to be inwoven. The Kashan weavers did so, and on 12 September 1602 Muratowicz presented the carpets to the Polish king, and the bill to the treasurer of the crown.&lt;ref name="Erdmann 1966"/&gt; Representative Safavid carpets made of silk with inwoven gold and silver threads were erroneously believed by Western art historians to be of Polish manufacture. Although the error was corrected, carpets of this type retained the name of "Polish" or "Polonaise" carpets. The more appropriate type name of "Shah Abbas" carpets was suggested by [[Kurt Erdmann]].&lt;ref name="Erdmann 1966"/&gt;

==== Safavid "Vase technique" carpets from Kirmān ====
[[File:Sanguszko carpet 01.jpg|thumb|"Sanguszko carpet", Kirmān, 16/17th century. [[Miho Museum]]]]
[[File:Safavid tilework MKG Hamburg.jpg|thumb|Tiled arch with hunting scenes. Late 17th century, Isfahan/Iran. [[Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe]], Hamburg]]

A distinct group of Safavid carpets can be attributed to the region of Kirmān in southern Persia. May H. Beattie identified these carpets by their common structure:&lt;ref name="Beattie, 1976"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beattie|first1=May H.|title=Carpets of Central Persia : with special references to rugs of Kirman.|date=1976|publisher=World of Islam Festival Pub. Co.|location=[S.l.]|isbn=0905035178|pages=19–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven different types of carpets were identified: Garden carpets (depicting formal gardens and water channels); carpets with centralized designs, characterized by a large medallion; multiple-medaillon designs with offset medaillons and compartment repeats; directional designs with the arrangements of little scenes used as individual motifs; sickle-leaf designs where long, curved, serrated and sometimes compound leaves dominate the field; arabesque; and lattice designs. Their distinctive structure consists of asymmetric knots; the cotton warps are depressed, and there are three wefts. The first and third weft are made of wool, and lie hidden in the center of the carpet. The middle weft is of silk or cotton, and passes from the back to the front. When the carpets are worn, this third weft evokes a characteristic, "tram line" effect.

The best known "vase technique" carpets from Kirmān are those of the so-called "Sanguszko group", named after the [[House of Sanguszko]], whose collection has the most outstanding example. The medallion-and-corner design is similar to other 16th century Safavid carpets, but the colours and style of drawing are distinct. In the central medallion, pairs of human figures in smaller medallions surround a central animal combat scene. Other animal combats are depicted in the field, while horsemen are shown in the corner medallions. The main border also contains lobed medallions with [[Houri]]s, animal combats, or confronting peacocks. In-between the border medallions, phoenixes and dragons are fighting. By similarity to mosaic tile spandrels in the [[Ganjali Khan Complex]] at the Kirmān bazaar with an inscription recording its date of completion as 1006 AH/AD 1596, they are dated to the end of the 16th or the beginning of the 17th century.&lt;ref name="Ferrier, 1989"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ferrier|first1=R.W.|title=The arts of Persia|date=1989|publisher=Yale Univ. Press|location=New Haven|isbn=0300039875|pages=124–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two other "vase technique" carpets have inscriptions with a date: One of them bears the date 1172 AH/AD 1758 and the name of the weaver: the Master Craftsman Muhammad Sharīf Kirmānī, the other has three inscriptions indicating that it was woven by the Master Craftsman Mu'min, son of Qutb al-Dīn Māhānī, between 1066-7 AH/AD 1655-6. Carpets in the Safavid tradition were still woven in Kirmān after the fall of the Safavid dynasty in 1732 (Ferrier, 1989, p.&amp;nbsp;127&lt;ref name="Ferrier, 1989"/&gt;).

The end of [[Shah Abbas II]]'s reign in 1666 marked the beginning of the end of the Safavid dynasty. The declining country was repeatedly raided on its frontiers. Finally, a [[Ghilzai]] [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] chieftain named [[Mirwais Khan Hotak|Mir Wais Khan]] began a rebellion in [[Kandahar]] and defeated the Safavid army under the Iranian Georgian governor over the region, [[Gurgin Khan]]. In 1722, [[Peter the Great]] launched the [[Russo-Persian War (1722-1723)]], capturing many of Iran's Caucasian territories, including [[Derbent]], [[Sheki, Azerbaijan|Shaki]], [[Baku]], but also [[Gilan]], [[Mazandaran]] and [[Astrabad]]. In 1722, an Afghan army led by [[Mir Mahmud Hotaki]] marched across eastern Iran, and [[Siege of Isfahan|besieged and took Isfahan]]. Mahmud proclaimed himself 'Shah' of Persia. Meanwhile, Persia's imperial rivals, the Ottomans and the Russians, took advantage of the chaos in the country to seize more territory for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Axworthy|first1=Michael|title=The sword of Persia : Nader Shah, from tribal warrior to conquering tyrant|date=2008|publisher=I.

=== The Afsharid (1736–1796) and Zand (1750–1796) dynasties ===
[[File:North West Persian Runner detail.jpg|thumb|North West Persian Runner (detail), late 18th century|upright]]
Iran's territorial integrity was restored by a native Iranian [[Turkic people|Turkic]] [[Afsharid|Afshar]] warlord from Khorasan, [[Nader Shah]]. He defeated the Afghans, and [[Ottoman–Persian War (1730–35)|Ottomans]], [[Restoration of Tahmasp II to the Safavid throne|reinstalled]] the Safavids on the throne, and negotiated Russian withdrawal from Irans Caucasian territories, by the [[Treaty of Resht]] and [[Treaty of Ganja]]. By 1736, Nader himself was crowned shah. There are no records of carpet weaving, which had sunk to an insignificant handicraft, during the [[Afsharid dynasty|Afsharid]] and [[Zand dynasty|Zand]] dynasties.&lt;ref name="Edwards, 1952"/&gt;

=== The Qajãr dynasty (1789–1925) ===
In 1789, [[Mohammad Khan Qajar]] was crowned king of Persia, the founder of the [[Qajar dynasty]], which provided Persia with a long period of order and comparative peace, and the industry had an opportunity of revival. The three important Qajãr monarchs [[Fath-Ali Shah Qajar]], [[Naser al-Din Shah Qajar]], and [[Mozaffar ad-Din Shah Qajar]] revived the ancient traditions of the Persian monarchy. The weavers of Tabriz took the opportunity, and around 1885 became the founders of the modern industry of carpet weaving in Persia.&lt;ref name="Edwards, 1952"/&gt;

=== The Pahlavi dynasty (1925–1979) ===
In the aftermath of the [[Russian Revolution]], Persia had become a battleground. In 1917, Britain used Iran as the springboard for an attack into Russia in an [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|unsuccessful attempt]] to reverse the Revolution. The [[Soviet Union]] responded by annexing portions of northern Persia, creating the [[Persian Soviet Socialist Republic]]. By 1920, the Iranian government had lost virtually all power outside its capital: British and Soviet forces exercised control over most of the Iranian mainland.

In 1925 Rezā Shāh, supported by the British government, deposed [[Ahmad Shah Qajar]], the last [[Shah]] of the [[Qajar dynasty]], and founded the [[Pahlavi dynasty]]. He established a constitutional monarchy that lasted until the [[Iranian Revolution]] in 1979. Reza Shah introduced social, economic, and political reforms, ultimately laying the foundation of the modern Iranian state. In order to stabilize and legitimate their reign, Rezā Shāh and his son [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] aimed at reviving ancient Persian traditions. The revival of carpet weaving, often referring to traditional designs, was an important part of these efforts. In 1935, Rezā Shāh founded the Iran Carpet Company, and brought carpet weaving under government control. Elaborate carpets were woven for export, and as diplomatic gifts to other states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hillmann|first1=Michael Craig|title=A cultural-aesthetic analysis of a modern Persian carpet|journal=Oriental Rug Review|date=1989|volume=9|issue=6|pages=29–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pahlavi dynasty modernized and centralized the Iranian government, and sought effective control and authority over all their subjects. Reza Shah was the first Persian monarch to confront this challenge with modern weapons. Enforced by the army, nomadism was outlawed during the 1930s, traditional tribal dresses were banned, the use of tents and yurts was forbidden in Iran. Unable to migrate, having lost their herds, many nomadic families starved to death. A brief era of relative peace followed for the nomadic tribes in the 1940s and 1950s, when Persia was involved in the Second World War, and Rezā Shāh was forced to abdicate in 1941. His successor, Mohammed Reza Shah consolidated his power during the 1950s. His land reform program of 1962, part of the so-called [[White Revolution]], despite obvious advantages for landless peasants, destroyed the traditional political organization of nomadic tribes like the [[Qashqai people]], and the traditional way of nomadic life. The centuries-old traditions of nomadic carpet weaving, which had entered a process of decline with the introduction of synthetic dyes and commercial designs in the late nineteenth century, were almost annihilated by the politics of the last Iranian imperial dynasty.&lt;ref name="Opie, Tribal Rugs"/&gt;

=== Modern times ===
[[File:Tabriz Lilac.jpg|thumb|Modern Iranian Carpet "Tabriz Lilac", 2010, by Hossein Rezvani]]
[[File:TapisGabbeh.png|thumb|A modern gabbeh carpet]]

After the [[Iranian Revolution]], little information could at first be obtained about carpet weaving in Iran. In the 1970s and 1980s, a new interest arose in Europe in [[Gabbeh]] rugs, which were initially woven by nomadic tribes for their own use. Their coarse weaving and simple, abstract designs appealed to Western customers.

In 1992, the first Grand Persian Conference and Exhibition in Tehran presented for the first time modern Persian carpet designs. Persian master weavers like Razam Arabzadeh displayed carpets woven in the traditional technique, but with unusual, modern designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eilland|first1=Murray L. III|title=Persian design: A step forward|journal=The Decorative Rug|date=1994|volume=7|issue=9|pages=40–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the Grand Conferences continue to take place at regular intervals, two trends can be observed in Iranian carpet weaving today. On the one hand, modern and innovative artistic designs are invented and developed by Iranian manufacturers, who thus take the ancient design tradition forward towards the twenty-first century. On the other hand, the renewed interest in natural dyes&lt;ref name="Opie, Vegetal dyes, Iran"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Opie|first1=James|title=Vegetal Dyes: Iran restores an ancient tradition.|journal=Oriental Rug Review|date=1992|volume=III|issue=10|pages=26–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; was taken up by commercial enterprises, which commission carpets to tribal village weavers. This provides a regular source of income for the carpet weavers. The companies usually provide the material and specify the designs, but the weavers are allowed some degree of creative freedom. With the end of the U.S. [[Sanctions against Iran|embargo]] on Iranian goods, also Persian carpets (including antique Persian carpets acquired at auctions) may become more easily available to U.S. customers again.

As commercial household goods, Persian carpets today are encountering competition from other countries with lower wages and cheaper methods of production: Machine-woven, [[Tufting|tufted]] rugs, or rugs woven by hand, but with the faster and less costly loop weaving method, provide rugs in "oriental" designs of utilitarian, but no artistic value. Traditional hand woven carpets, made of sheep wool dyed with natural colours are increasingly sought after. They are usually sold at higher prices due to the large amount of manual work associated with their production, which has, essentially, not changed since ancient times, and due to the artistic value of their design. Thus, the Persian carpet retains its ancient status as an object of luxury, beauty, and art.

== Materials ==

=== Wool ===
In most Persian rugs, the pile is of [[Sheep|sheep's]] wool. Its characteristics and quality vary from each area to the next, depending on the breed of sheep, climatic conditions, pasturage, and the particular customs relating to when and how the wool is shorn and processed.&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eilland|first1=Murray L. Jr.|last2=Eilland|first2=Murray III|title=Oriental Rugs - A Complete Guide|date=1998|publisher=Callmann &amp; King Ltd.|location=London|edition=revised}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different areas of a sheep's fleece yield different qualities of wool, depending on the ratio between the thicker and stiffer sheep hair and the finer fibers of the wool. Usually, sheep are [[Sheep shearing|shorn]] in spring and fall. The spring shear produces wool of finer quality. The lowest grade of wool used in carpet weaving is "skin" wool, which is removed chemically from dead animal skin.&lt;ref name="Edwards, 1952"/&gt; Higher grades of Persian wool are often referred to as '''kurk''', or '''kork''' wool, which is gained from the wool growing on the sheep's neck.&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt; Modern production also makes use of imported wool, e.g. [[Merino]] wool from [[New Zealand]], because the high demand on carpet wool cannot be entirely met by the local production. Fibers from [[camel]]s and [[goat]]s are also used. Goat hair is mainly used for fastening the borders, or selvedges, of nomadic rugs like [[Baloch people|Baluch]] rugs, since it is more resistant to abrasion. Camel wool is occasionally used in Persian nomadic rugs. It is often dyed in black, or used in its natural colour. More often, wool said to be camel's wool turns out to be dyed sheep wool.&lt;ref name="Edwards, 1952"/&gt;

=== Cotton ===
[[Cotton]] forms the foundation of warps and wefts of the majority of modern rugs. Nomads who cannot afford to buy cotton on the market use wool for warps and wefts, which are also traditionally made of wool in areas where cotton was not a local product. Cotton can be spun more tightly than wool, and tolerates more tension, which makes cotton a superior material for the foundation of a rug. Especially larger carpets are more likely to lie flat on the floor, whereas wool tends to shrink unevenly, and carpets with a woolen foundation may buckle when wet.&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt; Chemically treated ([[Mercerised cotton|mercerised]]) cotton has been used in rugs as a silk substitute since the late nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt;

=== Silk ===
[[Silk]] is an expensive material, and has been used for representative carpets. Its tensile strength has been used in silk warps, but silk also appears in the carpet pile. Silk pile can be used to highlight special elements of the design. High-quality carpets from Kashan, Qum, Nain, and Isfahan have all-silk piles. Silk pile carpets are often exceptionally fine, with a short pile and an elaborate design. Silk pile is less resistant to mechanical stress, thus, all-silk piles are often used as [[Tapestries|wall hangings]], or pillows.

=== Spinning ===
{{see also|Hand spinning|Spinning (textiles)}}
[[File:Yarn twist S-Left Z-Right.svg|thumb|upright|50px|S-twist and Z-twist yarns]]

The fibers of wool, cotton, and silk are spun either by hand or mechanically by using [[spinning wheel]]s or industrial [[Spinning frame|spinning machines]] to produce the yarn. The direction in which the yarn is spun is called ''twist''. Yarns are characterized as S-twist or Z-twist according to the direction of spinning (see diagram).&lt;ref&gt;Kadolph, Sara J., ed.: ''Textiles'', 10th edition, Pearson/Prentice-Hall, 2007, {{ISBN|0-13-118769-4}}, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; Two or more spun yarns may be twisted together or ''[[plying|plied]]'' to form a thicker yarn. Generally, handspun single plies are spun with a Z-twist, and plying is done with an S-twist. Like nearly all Islamic rugs with the exception of Mamluk carpets, nearly all Persian rugs use "Z" (anti-clockwise) spun and "S" (clockwise)-plied wool.

=== Dyeing ===
[[File:Carpet factory.jpg|thumb|Naturally dyed wool in a Turkish carpet manufacture]]

The dyeing process involves the preparation of the yarn in order to make it susceptible for the proper dyes by immersion in a [[mordant]]. Dyestuffs are then added to the yarn which remains in the dyeing solution for a defined time. The dyed yarn is then left to dry, exposed to air and sunlight. Some colours, especially dark brown, require iron mordants, which can damage or fade the fabric. This often results in faster pile wear in areas dyed in dark brown colours, and may create a relief effect in antique oriental carpets.

==== Plants ====
[[Natural dye|Traditional dyes]] used in Persian rugs are obtained from plants and insects. In 1856, the English chemist [[William Henry Perkin]] invented the first [[aniline]] dye, [[mauveine]]. A variety of other synthetic [[dyes]] were invented thereafter. Cheap, readily prepared and easy to use as they were compared to natural dyes, their use is documented since the mid 1860s. The tradition of natural dyeing was revived in Turkey in the early 1980s. Chemical analyses led to the identification of natural dyes from antique wool samples, and dyeing recipes and processes were experimentally re-created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boehmer|first1=Harald|title=The Revival of Natural Dyeing in Two Traditional Weaving Areas of Anatolia|journal=Oriental Rug Review|date=1983|volume=III|issue=9|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Atlihan|first1=Serife|title=Traditional Weaving in One Village of Settled Nomads in Northwest Anatolia|journal=Oriental Carpet and Textile Studies|date=1993|volume=IV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to these analyses, natural dyes used for carpet wool include:
* ''Red'' from [[Rubia tinctorum|Madder (Rubia tinctorum)]] roots,
* ''Yellow'' from plants, including [[Onion|onion (Allium cepa)]], several chamomile species ([[Anthemis]], [[Matricaria chamomilla]]), and [[Euphorbia]],
* ''Black'': [[Oak apple]]s, [[Oak|Oak acorns]], [[Rhus coriaria|Tanner's sumach]],
* ''Green'' by double dyeing with [[Indigo]] and yellow dye,
* ''Orange'' by double dyeing with madder red and yellow dye,
* ''Blue'': [[Indigo]] gained from [[Indigofera tinctoria]].
Some of the dyestuffs like indigo or madder were goods of trade, and thus commonly available. Yellow or brown dyestuffs more substantially vary from region to region. Many plants provide yellow dyes, like Vine weld, or Dyer's weed ''([[Reseda luteola]])'', Yellow larkspur, or Dyer's sumach [[Cotinus coggygria]]. Grape leaves and pomegranate rinds, as well as other plants, provide different shades of yellow.&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt;

In Iran, traditional dyeing with natural dyes was revived in the 1990s, inspired by the renewed general interest in traditionally produced rugs, but master dyers like Abbas Sayahi had kept alive the knowledge about the traditional recipes.&lt;ref name="Opie, Vegetal dyes, Iran"/&gt;

==== Insect reds ====
[[Carmine]] dyes are obtained from resinous secretions of scale insects such as the [[Cochineal]] scale [[Coccus cacti]], and certain Porphyrophora species ([[Armenian cochineal|Armenian]] and [[Polish cochineal]]). Cochineal dye, the so-called "laq" was formerly exported from India, and later on from Mexico and the Canary Islands. Insect dyes were more frequently used in areas where [[Rubia tinctorum|Madder (Rubia tinctorum)]] was not grown, like west and north-west Persia.&lt;ref name="Edwards, 1952"/&gt;

==== Synthetic dyes ====
With modern synthetic [[dyes]], nearly every colour and shade can be obtained so that without chemical analysis it is nearly impossible to identify, in a finished carpet, whether natural or artificial dyes were used. Modern carpets can be woven with carefully selected synthetic colours, and provide artistic and utilitarian value.&lt;ref name="Eilland, 2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eilland|first1=Emmett|title=Oriental Rugs Today|date=2003|publisher=Berkeley Hills Books, Albany, CA|isbn=1-893163-46-6|pages=50–59|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Abrash ====
The appearance of slight deviations within the same colour is called abrash (from Turkish ''abraş'', literally, “speckled, piebald”). Abrash is seen in traditionally dyed oriental rugs. Its occurrence suggests that a single weaver has likely woven the carpet, who did not have enough time or resources to prepare a sufficient quantity of dyed yarn to complete the rug. Only small batches of wool were dyed from time to time. When one string of wool was used up, the weaver continued with the newly dyed batch. Because the exact hue of colour is rarely met again when a new batch is dyed, the colour of the pile changes when a new row of knots is woven in. As such, the colour variation suggests a village or tribal woven rug, and is appreciated as a sign of quality and authenticity. Abrash can also be introduced on purpose into a newly planned carpet design.&lt;ref name="O'Bannon 1995"&gt;{{cite book|last1=O'Bannon|first1=George|title=Oriental rugs : the collector's guide to selecting, identifying, and enjoying new and vintage oriental rugs|date=1995|publisher=Courage Press|location=Pennsylvania, Pa.|isbn=9781561385287|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques and structures==
{{see also|Oriental rug # manufacture}}

=== The process of weaving a rug ===
The weaving of pile rugs is a time-consuming process which, depending on the quality and size of the rug, may take anywhere from a few months to several years to complete.

To begin making a rug, one needs a foundation consisting of warps and wefts: [[Warp (weaving)|Warps]] are strong, thick threads of cotton, wool or silk which run through the length of the rug. Similar threads which pass under and over the warps from one side to the other are called [[Warp and woof|wefts]]. The warps on either side of the rug are normally plied into one or more strings of varying thickness that are overcast to form the selvedge.

Weaving normally begins from the bottom of the loom, by passing a number of wefts through the warps to form a base to start from. Knots of dyed wool, cotton or silk threads are then tied in rows around consecutive sets of adjacent warps. As more rows are tied to the foundation, these knots become the pile of the rug. Between each row of knots, one or more shots of weft are passed to keep the knots fixed. The wefts are then beaten down by a comb-like instrument, the comb beater, to further compact and secure the newly-woven row. Depending on the fineness of the weave, the quality of the materials and the expertise of the weavers, the [[knot count]] of a handmade rug can vary anywhere from 16 to 800 knots per square inch.

When the rug is completed, the warp ends form the fringes that may be weft-faced, braided, tasseled, or secured in other ways.

===Looms===
Looms do not vary greatly in essential details, but they do vary in size and sophistication. The main technical requirement of the loom is to provide the correct tension and the means of dividing the warps into alternate sets of leaves. A shedding device allows the weaver to pass wefts through crossed and uncrossed warps, instead of laboriously threading the weft in and out of the warps.

===Horizontal looms===
The simplest form of loom is a horizontal; one that can be staked to the ground or supported by sidepieces on the ground. The necessary tension can be obtained through the use of wedges. This style of loom is ideal for nomadic people as it can be assembled or dismantled and is easily transportable. Rugs produced on horizontal looms are generally fairly small and the weave quality is inferior to those rugs made on a professional standing loom.&lt;ref name="Edwards, 1952"/&gt;

===Vertical looms===
The technically more advanced, stationary vertical looms are used in villages and town manufactures. The more advanced types of vertical looms are more comfortable, as they allow for the weavers to retain their position throughout the entire weaving process. The Tabriz type of vertical loom allows for weaving of carpets up to double the length of the loom, while there is no limit to the length of the carpet that can be woven on a vertical roller beam loom. In essence, the width of the carpet is limited by the length of the loom beams.&lt;ref name="Edwards, 1952"/&gt;

There are three general types of vertical looms, all of which can be modified in a number of ways: the fixed village loom, the [[Tabriz]] or Bunyan loom, and the roller beam loom.

# The fixed village loom is used mainly in [[Iran]] and consists of a fixed upper beam and a moveable lower or cloth beam which slots into two sidepieces. The correct tension of the warps is obtained by driving wedges into the slots. The weavers work on an adjustable plank which is raised as the work progresses.
# The Tabriz loom, named after the city of [[Tabriz]], is used in Northwestern Iran. The warps are continuous and pass around behind the loom. Warp tension is obtained with wedges. The weavers sit on a fixed seat and when a portion of the carpet has been completed, the tension is released and the carpet is pulled down and rolled around the back of the loom. This process continues until the rug is completed, when the warps are severed and the carpet is taken off the loom.
# The roller beam loom is used in larger Turkish manufactures, but is also found in Persia and India. It consists of two movable beams to which the warps are attached. Both beams are fitted with ratchets or similar locking devices. Once a section of the carpet is completed, is rolled on to the lower beam. On a roller beam loom, any length of carpet can be produced. In some areas of Turkey several rugs are woven in series on the same warps, and separated from each other by cutting the warps after the weaving is finished.

===Tools===
[[File:Carpet tools.jpg|thumb|Some traditional tools of the craft.]]

The weaver needs a number of essential tools: a knife for cutting the yarn as the knots are tied; a heavy comb-like instrument with a handle for packing down the wefts; and a pair of shears for trimming the pile after a row of knots, or a small number of rows, have been woven. In Tabriz the knife is combined with a hook to tie the knots, which speeds up work. A small steel comb is sometimes used to comb out the yarn after each row of knots is completed.

A variety of additional instruments are used for packing the weft. Some weaving areas in Iran known for producing very fine pieces use additional tools. In [[Kerman]], a saber like instrument is used horizontally inside the shed. In [[Bijar (city)|Bijar]], a nail-like tool is inserted between the warps, and beaten on in order to compact the fabric even more. Bijar is also famous for their wet loom technique, which consists of wetting the warp, weft, and yarn with water throughout the weaving process to compact the wool and allow for a particularly heavy compression of the pile, warps, and wefts. When the rug is complete and dried, the wool and cotton expand, which results in a very heavy and stiff texture. Bijar rugs are not easily pliable without damaging the fabric.

A number of different tools may be used to shear the wool depending on how the rug is trimmed as the weaving progresses or when the rug is complete. Often in Chinese rugs the yarn is trimmed after completion and the trimming is slanted where the color changes, giving an embossed three-dimensional effect.

===Knots===
{{main|Knotted-pile carpet}}
{{multiple image

}}

Persian carpets are mainly woven with two different knots: The symmetrical [[Ghiordes knot|Turkish]] or "Giordes" knot, also used in Turkey, the Caucasus, East Turkmenistan, and some Turkish and Kurdish areas of Iran, and the asymmetrical '''Persian''', or '''Senneh knot''', also used in India, Turkey, Pakistan, China, and Egypt. The term "Senneh knot" is somewhat misleading, as rugs are woven with symmetric knots in the town of Senneh.&lt;ref name="Edwards, 1952"/&gt;

To tie a symmetric knot, the yarn is passed between two adjacent warps, brought back under one, wrapped around both forming a collar, then pulled through the center so that both ends emerge between the warps.&lt;ref name="Edwards, 1952"/&gt;

The asymmetric knot is tied by wrapping the yarn around only one warp, then the thread is passed behind the adjacent warp so that it divides the two ends of the yarn. The Persian knot may open on the left or the right.&lt;ref name="Edwards, 1952"/&gt;

The asymmetric knot allows to produce more fluent, often curvilinear designs, while more bold, rectilinear designs may use the symmetric knot. As exemplified by Senneh rugs with their elaborate designs woven with symmetric knots, the quality of the design depends more on the weaver's skills, than on the type of knot which is used.&lt;ref name="Edwards, 1952"/&gt;

Another knot frequently used in Persian carpets is the Jufti knot, which is tied around four warps instead of two.&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt; A serviceable carpet can be made with jufti knots, and jufti knots are sometimes used in large single-colour areas of a rug, for example in the field, to save on material. However, as carpets woven wholly or partly with the jufti knot need only half the amount of pile yarn compared to traditionally woven carpets, their pile is less resistant to wear, and these rugs do not last as long.&lt;ref name="Edwards, 1952"/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Flat-woven carpets===
Flat woven carpets are given their colour and pattern from the weft which is tightly intertwined with the warp. Rather than an actual pile, the foundation of these rugs gives them their design. The weft is woven between the warp until a new colour is needed, it is then looped back and knotted before a new colour is implemented.

The most popular of flat-weaves is called the Kilim. Kilim rugs (along with jewellery, clothing and animals) are important for the identity and wealth of nomadic tribes-people. In their traditional setting Kilims are used as floor and wall coverings, horse-saddles, storage bags, bedding and cushion covers.

Various forms of flat-weaves exist including:
*[[Herati rug|Herati]]
*[[Jajim rug|Jajim]]
*[[Gelim]] ([[Kilim]])
*[[Maleki rug|Maleki]]
*[[Sirjan rug|Sirjan]]
*[[Soumak rug|Soumak]] (Soumakh)
*[[Suzani rug|Suzani]]

==Design==
[[File:Persian Kermanshah 'Tree of Life' (4-6 x 7-8, ca 3rd quarter 19th century).jpg|thumb|[[Kermanshah]] 'Tree of Life' carpet, 3rd quarter 19th century]]
In 2016 Iran had 40 carpet designs that each belong to a different [[Provinces of Iran|geographical region]] including 29 designs internationally registered with the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;http://presstv.com/Detail/2016/11/06/492379/Iran-to-ship-carpets-to-US-directly-soon&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Formats and special types ===
* '''''Ghali''''' (Persian: {{lang|fa|قالی}}, lit. "carpet"): large format carpets (190 × 280&amp;nbsp;cm).
* '''''Dozar''''' or '''''Sedjadeh''''': The term comes from Persian ''do'', "two" and ''zar'', a Persian measure corresponding to about {{convert|105|cm|lk=out|abbr=off}}. Carpets of Dozar size are approximately {{convert|130|-|140|cm|abbr=on}} x {{convert|200|-|210|cm|abbr=on}}.
* '''''Ghalitcheh''''' (Persian: {{lang|fa|قالیچه}}): Carpet of Dozar format, but woven in very fine quality.
* '''''Kelleghi''''' or '''''Kelley''''' : A long format, ca. {{convert|150|-|200|cm|abbr=on}} x {{convert|300|-|600|cm|abbr=on}}. This format is traditionally placed at the head of a ''ghali'' carpet (''kalleh'' means "head" in Persian).
* '''''Kenareh''''' : Smaller long format: {{convert|80|-|120|cm|abbr=on}} × {{convert|250|-|600|cm|abbr=on}}. Traditionally laid out along the longer sides of a larger carpet (''kenār'' means "side" in Persian language).
* '''''Zaronim''''' : corresponds to 1 ½ ''zar''. These smaller rugs are about {{convert|150|cm|abbr=on}} long.

[[Nomad]]ic carpets are also known as '''''Gelim''''' ({{lang|fa|گلیم}}; including {{lang|fa|زیلو}} ''Zilu'', meaning "rough carpet".&lt;ref name="Savory, R."/&gt; In this use, Gelim includes both pile rugs and flat weaves (such as [[kilim]] and [[soumak rug|soumak]]).

=== Field design, medallions and borders ===
[[File:Toranj - special circular design of Iranian carpets.JPG|thumbnail|Toranj (medallion) - special circular design of Iranian carpets]]
Rug design can be described by the way the ornaments are arranged within the pile. One basic design may dominate the entire field, or the surface may be covered by a pattern of repeating figures.

In areas with traditional, time-honoured local designs, such as the Persian nomad tribes, the weaver is able to work from memory, as the specific patterns are part of the family or tribal tradition. This is usually sufficient for less elaborate, mostly rectilinear designs. For more elaborate, especially curvilinear designs, the patterns are carefully drawn to scale in the proper colours on graph paper. The resulting design plan is termed a "cartoon". The weaver weaves a knot for each square on the scale paper, which allows for an accurate rendition of even the most complex designs. Designs have changed little through centuries of weaving. Today computers are used in the production of scale drawings for the weavers.&lt;ref&gt;Oriental Rugs: A Complete Guide, by Murray L. Eiland Jr. &amp; Murray Eiland III, London 2008, page 66&lt;/ref&gt;

The surface of the rug is arranged and organized in typical ways, which in all their variety are nevertheless recognizable as Persian: One single, basic design may cover the entire field ('''"all-over design"'''). When the end of the field is reached, patterns may be cut off intentionally, thus creating the impression that they continue beyond the borders of the rug. This feature is characteristic for Islamic design: In the Islamic tradition, depicting animals or humans is [[Aniconism in Islam|prohibited]] even in a profane context, as Islam does not distinguish between religious and profane life. Since the codification of the [[Quran]] by [[Uthman|Uthman Ibn Affan]] in 651 AD/19 AH and the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] reforms, [[Islamic art]] has focused on writing and ornament. The main fields of Persian rugs are frequently filled with redundant, interwoven ornaments, often in form of elaborate spirals and tendrils in a manner called '''infinite repeat'''.&lt;ref name="Erdmann, 1943"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Erdmann|first1=Kurt|title=Zum Orientteppich|journal=Asienberichte|date=1943|volume=5|issue=19|page=20|location=Vienna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Design elements may also be arranged more elaborately. One typical oriental rug design uses a '''medallion''', a symmetrical pattern occupying the center of the field. Parts of the medallion, or similar, corresponding designs, are repeated at the four '''corners''' of the field. The common Persian "Lechek Torūnj" (medaillon and corner) design was developed in Persia for book covers and ornamental [[Persian miniature|book illuminations]] in the fifteenth century. In the sixteenth century, it was integrated into carpet designs. More than one medallion may be used, and these may be arranged at intervals over the field in different sizes and shapes. The field of a rug may also be broken up into different rectangular, square, diamond or lozenge shaped compartments, which in turn can be arranged in rows, or diagonally.&lt;ref name="Ford, Oriental Carpet Design"/&gt;

In contrast to Anatolian rugs, the Persian carpet medaillon represents the primary pattern, and the infinite repeat of the field appears subordinate, creating an impression of the medaillon "floating" on the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erdmann|first1=Kurt|title=Der Orientalische Knüpfteppich. tr. C. G. Ellis as Oriental Carpets: An Essay on Their History, New York, 1960.|date=1965|publisher=Verlag Ernst Wasmuth|location=Tübingen|pages=47–51|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most Persian rugs, the field of the rug is surrounded by stripes, or borders. These may number from one up to over ten, but usually there is one wider '''main border''' surrounded by minor, or '''guardian borders'''. The main border is often filled with complex and elaborate rectilinear or curvilinear designs. The minor border stripes show simpler designs like meandering vines. The traditional Persian border arrangement was highly conserved through time, but can also be modified to the effect that the field encroaches on the main border. This feature is often seen in Kerman rugs from the late nineteenth century, and was likely taken over from French [[Aubusson tapestry|Aubusson]] or [[Savonnerie]] weaving designs.

The corner articulations are a particularly challenging part of rug design. The ornaments have to be woven in a way that the pattern continues without interruption around the corners between horizontal and vertical borders. This requires advance planning either by a skilled weaver who is able to plan the design from start, or by a designer who composes a cartoon before the weaving begins. If the ornaments articulate correctly around the corners, the corners are termed to be "resolved", or "reconciled". In village or nomadic rugs, which are usually woven without a detailed advance plan, the corners of the borders are often not resolved. The weaver then discontinues the pattern at a certain stage, e.g., when the lower horizontal border is finished, and starts anew with the vertical borders. The analysis of the corner resolution helps distinguishing rural village, or nomadic, from workshop rugs.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Smaller and composite design elements ===
The field, or sections of it, can also be covered with smaller design elements. The overall impression may be homogeneous, although the design of the elements themselves can be highly complicated. Amongst the repeating figures, the [[Paisley (design)|'''boteh''']] is used throughout the "carpet belt". Boteh can be depicted in curvilinear or rectilinear style. The most elaborate boteh are found in rugs woven around [[Kerman carpet|Kerman]]. Rugs from [[Seraband rug|Seraband]], Hamadan, and Fars sometimes show the boteh in an all-over pattern. Other design elements include ancient motifs like the [[Tree of life]], or floral and geometric elements like, e.g., stars or palmettes.

Single design elements can also be arranged in groups, forming a more complex pattern:&lt;ref name="Edwards, 1952"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ford, Oriental Carpet Design"/&gt;
* The '''Herati''' pattern consists of a lozenge with floral figure at the corners surrounded by lancet-shaped leaves sometimes called "fish".  Herati patterns are used throughout the "carpet belt"; typically, they are found in the fields of [[Bidjar rug]]s. 
* The '''Mina Khani''' pattern is made up of flowers arranged in a rows, interlinked by diamond (often curved) or circular lines. frequently all over the field. The Mina Khani design is often seen on [[Varamin Carpet|Varamin rugs]].
* The '''Shah Abbasi''' design is composed of a group of palmettes. Shah Abbasi motifs are frequently seen in [[Kashan rug|Kashan]], [[Isfahan rug|Isfahan]], [[Mashhad rug|Mashhad]] and [[Nain rug|Nain]] rugs.
* The '''Bid Majnūn''', or Weeping Willow design is in fact a combination of weeping willow, cypress, poplar and fruit trees in rectilinear form. Its origin was attributed to Kurdish tribes, as the earliest known examples are from the Bidjar area.
* The '''Harshang''' or Crab design takes its name from its principal motive, which is a large oval motive suggesting a crab. The pattern is found all over the rug belt, but bear some resemblance to palmettes from the Safavid period, and the "claws" of the crab may be conventionalized arabesques in rectilinear style.
* The '''Gol Henai''' small repeating pattern is named after the Henna plant, which it does not much resemble. The plant looks more like the Garden balsam, and in the Western literature is sometimes compared to the blossom of the Horse chestnut.

== Classification ==
Persian carpets are best classified by the social context of their weavers. Carpets were produced simultaneously by nomadic tribes, in villages, town and court manufactures, for home use, local sale, or export.
{{clear}}

=== Nomadic/tribal carpets ===
Nomadic, or tribal carpets are produced by different ethnic groups with distinct histories and traditions. As the nomadic tribes originally wove carpets mainly for their own use, their designs have maintained much of the tribal traditions. However, during the twentieth century, the nomadic lifestyle was changed to a more sedentary way either voluntarily, or by the forced settlement policy of the last Persian emperors of the [[Pahlavi dynasty]]. By 1970, it was observed that traditional weaving had almost ceased among major nomadic tribes,&lt;ref name="Opie, Tribal Rugs"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Opie|first1=James|title=Tribal rugs - Nomadic and Village Weavings from the Near East and Central Asia|date=1992|publisher=Laurence King Publishing|isbn=1-85669-025-3|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Opie, Tribal Rugs of Southern Persia"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Opie|first1=James|title=Tribal Rugs of Southern Persia|date=1981|publisher=James Opie Oriental Rugs Inc.|location=Portland, Oregon|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in recent years, the tradition has been revived.&lt;ref name="Opie, Vegetal dyes, Iran"/&gt;

==== Kurds ====
The [[Kurds]] are an [[ethnic group]], mostly inhabiting the area spanning adjacent parts of southeastern ([[Turkish Kurdistan|Turkey]]), western ([[Iranian Kurdistan|Iran]]), northern ([[Iraqi Kurdistan|Iraq]]), and northern ([[Rojava|Syria]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bengio|first1=Ofra|title=Kurdish awakening: Nation building in a fragmented homeland|date=2014|publisher=Univ of Texas Press|location=[S.l.]|isbn=978-0292758131}}&lt;/ref&gt; The large population and the wide geographical distribution of the Kurds account for a varied production spanning a spectre from coarse and naïve nomadic weavings to the most elaborate town manufacture carpets, finely woven like Senneh, or heavy fabrics like [[Bidjar rug|Bijar]] carpets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eagleton|first1=William|title=An introduction to Kurdish rugs and other weavings|date=1988|publisher=Interlink Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0940793170|edition=1st American}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Kurdish rugs represent a traditional part of Persian rug production, they merit separate consideration.

===== Senneh carpets =====
[[File:Senneh.jpg|thumb|1Senneh rug]]

The city of [[Sanandij]], formerly known as Senneh, is the capital of [[Kurdistan Province|Persian Kurdistan]]. The rugs produced here are still known, also in the Iran of today, under their trade name "Senneh". They belong to the most finely woven Persian rugs, with knot counts up to 400 per square inch (6200/&amp;nbsp;dm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The pile is closely clipped, and the foundation is cotton, also silk was used in antique carpets. Some fine carpets have silk warps dyed in different colours which create fringes in different colours known as "rainbow warps" in the rug trade. Mostly blue colours are used in the field, or a pale red. The predominant pattern used to be the Herati pattern, with a lozenge-shaped central medallion also filled with repeating Herati patterns on a different background colour. More realistic floral patterns are also seen, probably in rugs woven for export to Europe.&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt;

===== Bijar carpets =====
[[File:Fine Bidjar rug.jpg|thumb|Bidjar rug]]

The town of [[Bijar (city)|Bijar]] lies around {{convert|80|km|abbr=off}} northeast of Sanadij. Together, these two towns and their surrounding areas have been major centers of rug production since the eighteenth century. Carpets woven in Bijar and the surrounding villages show more varied designs than Senneh rugs, which has led to the distinction between "city" and "village" Bijar rugs. The Bijar rug is distinguished by its highly packed pile, which is produced by a special technique known as "wet weaving", with the help of a special tool. Warps, weft and pile are constantly kept wet during the weaving process. When the finished carpet is allowed to dry, the wool expands, and the fabric becomes more compact. The fabric is further compacted by vigorous hammering on nail-like metal devices which are inserted between the warps during the weaving. Alternate warps are moderately to deeply depressed. The fabric is further compacted by using wefts of different thickness. Usually one of three wefts is consideravly thicker than the others. The knots are symmetrical, at a density of 60 to over 200 per square inch (930–2100/&amp;nbsp;dm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), rarely even over 400 (6200/&amp;nbsp;dm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

The colours of Bijar rugs are exquisite, with light and dark blues, and saturated to light, pale madder red. The designs are traditionally Persian, with predominant Herati, but also Mina Khani, Harshang, and simple medallion forms. Frequently the design is more rectilinear, but Bijar rugs are more easily identified by their peculiar, stiff and heavy weaving than by any design. Bijar rugs cannot be folded without risking to damage the foundation. A specific feature is also the lack of outlining, particularly of the smaller patterns. Full-size "sampler" carpets showing only examples of field and border designs rather than a fully developed carpet design are called "vagireh" by rug traders, and are frequently seen in the Bijar area. New Bijar carpets are still exported from the area, mostly with less elaborate Herati designs and dyed with good synthetic dyes.&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt;

===== Kurdish village rugs =====
From a Western perspective, there is not much detailed information about Kurdish village rugs, probably because there is insufficient information to identify them, as they have never been specifically collected in the West. Usually, rugs can only be identified as "northwest Persian, probably Kurdish".&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt; As is generally the case with village and nomadic rugs, the foundation of village rugs is more predominantly of wool. Kurdish sheep wool is of high quality, and takes dyes well. Thus, a rug with the distinct features of "village production", made of high-quality wool with particularly fine colours may be attributed to Kurdish production, but mostly these attributions remain educated guesswork. Extensive use of common rug patterns and designs poses further difficulty in assigning a specific regional or tribal provenience. A tendency of integrating regional traditions of the surrounding areas, like Anatolian or northwestern Persian designs was observed, which sometimes show distinct, unusual design variations leading to suggest a Kurdish production from within the adjacent areas. Also, northwestern Persian towns like Hamadan, Zenjan or Sauj Bulagh may have used "Kurdish" design features in the past, but modern production on display at the Grand Persian Exhibitions seems to focus on different designs.&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt;

==== Qashqai ====
[[File:Ghashghai rug.jpg|thumb|Qashqai rug]]
[[File:Qashqai tas front.jpg|thumb|Qashqai bag front]]
[[File:Abrash.JPG|thumb|Central medallion of a Qashqai rug, 19th century, with fragmented Herati pattern]]
{{see also|Shiraz rug}}

The early history of the [[Qashqai people]] remains obscure. They speak a Turkic dialect similar to that of Azerbaijan, and may have migrated to the Fars province from the north during the thirteenth century, possibly driven by the Mongol invasion. [[Karim Khan]] Zand appointed the chief of the Chahilu clan as the first Il-Khan of the Qashqai.&lt;ref name="Edwards, 1952"/&gt; The most important subtribes are the Qashguli, Shishbuluki, Darashuri, Farsimadan, and Amaleh. The Gallanzan, Rahimi, and Ikdir produce rugs of intermediate quality. The rugs woven by the Safi Khani and Bulli subtribes are considered among the highest quality rugs.&lt;ref name="Opie, Tribal Rugs of Southern Persia"/&gt; The rugs are all wool, usually with ivory warps, which distinguishes Qashqai from Khamseh rugs. Qashqai rugs use asymmetric knots, while Gabbeh rugs woven by Qashqai more often use symmetric knots. Alternate warps are deeply depressed. Wefts are in natural colours or dyed red. The selvedges are overcast in wool of different colours, creating a "barber pole" pattern, and are sometimes adorned with woolen tassels. Both ends of the rug have narrow, striped flat-woven kilims. Workshops were established in the nineteenth century already around the town of [[Firuzabad, Fars|Firuzabad]]. Rugs with repeating boteh and the Herati pattern, medallion, as well as prayer rug designs resembling the millefleurs patterns of Indian rugs were woven in these manufactures. The Herati design may sometimes appear to be disjointed and fragmented. The Qashqai are also known for their flatweaves, and for their production of smaller, pile-woven saddle bags, flat-woven larger bags (''mafrash''), and their [[Gabbeh]] rugs.

The '''Shishbuluki''' (''lit.'': "six districts") rugs are distinguished by small, central, lozenge-shaped medallions surrounded by small figures aligned in concentric lozenges radiating from the center. The field is most often red, details are often woven in yellow or ivory. '''Darashuri''' rugs are similar to those of the Shishbuluki, but not so finely woven.&lt;ref name="Parham 1996"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Parham|first1=Cyrus|title=Masterpieces of Fars Rugs|date=1996|publisher=Soroush Press|location=Tehran}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the truly nomadic way of life has virtually come to an end during the twentieth century, most Qashqai rugs are now woven in villages, using vertical looms, cotton warps, or even an all-cotton foundation. They use a variety of designs associated with the Qashqai tradition, but it is rarely possible to attribute a specific rug to a specific tribal tradition. Many patterns, including the "Qashqai medallion" previously thought to represent genuine nomadic design traditions, have been shown to be of town manufacture origin, and were integrated into the rural village traditions by a process of stylization.&lt;ref name="Ford, Oriental Carpet Design"/&gt;

The revival of natural dyeing has had a major impact on Qashqai rug production. Initiated in [[Shiraz]] during the 1990s by master dyers as Abbas Sayahi,&lt;ref name="Opie, Vegetal dyes, Iran"/&gt; particularly [[Gabbeh]] rugs raised much interest when they were first presented at the Great Persian Exhibition in 1992. Initially woven for home use and local trade, coarsely knotted with symmetric knots, the colours initially seen were mostly natural shades of wool. With the revival of natural colours, Gabbeh from [[Fars province]] soon were produced in a full range of colours. They met the Western demand for primitive, naïve folk art as opposed to elaborate commercialized designs, and gained high popularity. In the commercial production of today, the Gabbeh rug patterns remain simple, but tend to show more modern types of design.&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt;

==== Khamseh federation ====
{{see also|Shiraz rug}}
[[File:persian rug.jpg|thumb|A rug by [[Basseri|Basseri tribe]]]]

The [[Khamseh]] (''lit.'': "five tribes") federation was established by the Persian [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] government in the nineteenth century, to rival the dominant Qashqai power. Five tribal groups of Arab, Persian and Turkic origin were combined, including the Arab tribe, the [[Basseri]], Baharlu, Ainalu, and Nafar tribes.&lt;ref name="Opie, Tribal Rugs of Southern Persia"/&gt; It is difficult to attribute a specific rug to the Khamseh production, and the label "Khamseh" is often used as a term of convenience. Dark woolen warps and borders are associated with '''Arab''' Khamseh rugs, warps are rarely depressed, the colour scheme is more subdued. Specifically, a stylized bird (''"murgh"'') pattern is often seen on rugs attributed to the confederation, arranged around a succession of small, lozenge shaped medallions. '''[[Basseri]]''' rugs are asymmetrically knotted, brighter in colours, with more open space and smaller ornaments and figure with Orange as the specific color.&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt; The '''Baharlu''' are a Turkic-speaking tribe settled around [[Darab]], and few carpets are known from this more agricultural region.

==== Luri ====
The [[Lurs]] live mainly in western and south-western Iran. They are of Indo-European origin. Their [[Luri language|dialect]] is closely related to the [[Bakhtiari dialect]] and to the dialect of the southern [[Kurds]]. Their rugs have been marketed in [[Shiraz]]. The rugs have a dark wool foundation, with two wefts after each row of knots. Knots are symmetrical or asymmetrical. Small compartment designs of repeating stars are often seen, or lozenge-shaped medallions with anchor-like hooks on both ends.&lt;ref name="Opie, Tribal Rugs of Southern Persia"/&gt;

==== Afshari ====
{{see also|Afshar rugs}}

The [[Afshar people]] are a semi-nomadic group of Turkic origin, principally located in the mountainous areas surrounding the modern city of [[Kirman]] in southeastern Iran. They produce mainly rugs in runner formats, and bags and other household items with rectilinear or curvilinear designs, showing both central medallions and allover patterns. Colours are bright and pale red. The flat-woven ends often show multiple narrow stripes.&lt;ref name="O'Bannon 1995"/&gt;

==== Beluch ====
{{see also|Baluch rug}}
The [[Beluch]] people live in eastern Iran. They weave small-format rugs and a variety of bags with dark red and blue colours, often combined with dark brown and white. Camel hair is also used.&lt;ref name="O'Bannon 1995"/&gt;

=== Village carpets ===
Carpets produced in villages are usually brought to a regional market center, and carry the name of the market center as a label. Sometimes, as in the case of the "Serapi" rug, the name of the village serves as a label for a special quality. Village carpets can be identified by their less elaborate, more highly stylized designs.&lt;ref name="O'Bannon 1995"/&gt;

Criteria suggesting village production include:&lt;ref name="Wilber, 1989"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilber|first1=Donald N.|title=An introduction to Persian village rugs|journal=Oriental Rug Review|date=1989|volume=9|issue=6|pages=6–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# A rug of so-called scatter-size (''dozar'') that has been woven in a settled environment;
# woven without a cartoon;
# woven without reconciled corners;
# woven with possible idiosyncrasies of construction and pattern elements.

Village rugs are more apt to have warps of wool rather than of cotton. Their designs are not as elaborate and ornate than the curvilinear patterns of city rugs. They are more likely to display abrash and conspicuous mistakes in detail. On simple vertical looms, the correct tension of the warps is difficult to maintain during the entire weaving process. So, village rugs tend to vary in width from end to end, have irregular sides, and may not lay entirely flat. In contrast to manufactory rugs, there is considerable variety in treating the selvedges and fringes. Village rugs are less likely to present depressed warps, as compared to manufactory rugs. They tend to make less use of flat woven kilim ends to finish off the ends of the rug, as compared to tribal rugs. The variation in treatment of fringes and ends, and the way the selvedges are treated, provide clues as to place of origin.&lt;ref name="Wilber, 1989"/&gt;

==== Northwestern Iran ====
{{main|Azerbaijani carpet|Ardabil rugs|Caucasian carpets and rugs}}
[[Tabriz]] is the market center for the Iranian Northwest. Carpets woven in this region mainly use the symmetric knot. [[Heriz]] is a local center of production for mainly room-size carpets. Warps and weft are of cotton, the weaving is rather coarse, with high-quality wool. Prominent central medaillons are frequently seen with rectilinear outlines highlighted in white. The ornaments of the field are in bold, rectilinear style, sometimes in an allover design. Higher quality Heriz carpets are known as Serapi. The village of [[Sarab, East Azerbaijan|Sarab]] produces runners and galleries with broad main borders either of camel hair or wool dyed in the colour of camel hair. Large, interconnected medaillons fill the field. Mostly rectilinear, geometric and floral patterns are dyed in pink red and blue. [[Bakshaish rugs and carpets|Bakshaish carpets]] with a shield-shaped large medaillon, less elaborate rectilinear patterns in salmon red and blue are labeled after the village of [[Bakhshayesh]]. Karadja produces runners with specific square and octagonal medaillons in succession.&lt;ref name="O'Bannon 1995"/&gt;

==== Western Iran ====
Major production centers in the West are [[Hamadan]], [[Sarrak, Iran|Saruk]] with its neighbouring town of [[Arak, Iran|Arak]], [[Minudasht, Markazi|Minudasht]] also known under the trade name [[Lilihan carpets and rugs|Lilihan]] and Serabend, Maslaghan, [[Malayer]] and Feraghan.

* Carpets from '''Maslaghan''' are usually small (120 × 180&amp;nbsp;cm), the warps are made of cotton, the wefts of wool or cotton. The large medaillon shows a so-called "lobed [[Gul (design)|Göl]]", the colours of which are in sharp contrast to the field, with small borders. Malayer, Sarouk and Feraghan are located closely to each other. They use cotton for the foundation.&lt;ref name="O'Bannon 1995"/&gt;
* '''Malayer''' carpets sre distinguished by their single-weft and the use of the symmetrical knot. Allover and medaillon patterns are common, the boteh motif is frequently used.&lt;ref name="O'Bannon 1995"/&gt;
* The original '''Sarouk''' design was distinguished by a round-star medaillon with surrounding pendants. The traditional design of the Sarouk rug was modified by the weavers towards an allover design of detached floral motives, the carpets were then chemically washed to remove the unwanted colours, and the pile was painted over again with more desirable colours.&lt;ref name="Edwards, 1952"/&gt; '''Feraghan''' carpets are less finely woven thsn Sarouk. Often the Herati pattern is seen all over. Medaillons, if they occur, show more geometrical designs. A corroding green dye is typical for Feraghan carpets.&lt;ref name="O'Bannon 1995"/&gt;

==== Southern Iran ====
Since the mid-twentieth century, commercial production started in the villages of [[Abade]]h and Yalameh. [[Abadeh rug]]s adopted traditional [[Qashqai people|Qashqai]] designs, but used cotton for warps and wefts, the latter often dyed in blue. [[Yalameh rug|Yalameh]] carpets more resemble [[Khamseh]] designs with hooked medaillons arranged in the field. Warps and wefts were often in white.&lt;ref name="O'Bannon 1995"/&gt;

==== Eastern Iran ====
The village of Doroksh is known for its carpet production in Eastern Persia. They are characterized by their use of orange dyes, the boteh motif is often seen. Usually, there is only one border. The knots are asymmetric.&lt;ref name="O'Bannon 1995"/&gt;

=== Town carpets ===
[[File:Following the Pattern, Weaver, Esfahan, Iran (14451927066).jpg|thumb|Weaving a carpet from a cartoon, Esfahan, Iran]]

[[Tabriz]] in the West, [[Kerman]] in the South, and [[Mashhad]] in the Northeast of Iran, together with the central Iranian towns of [[Kashan]], [[Isfahan]], [[Nain, Iran|Nain]] and [[Qom]] are the main centers of town manufacture.&lt;ref name="O'Bannon 1995"/&gt;

* '''[[Tabriz rug|Tabriz]]''' has been a center of carpet production for centuries. All kinds of designs are reproduced by Tabrizi weavers, with wool or silk in the pile, and wool, cotton or silk in the foundation.
* '''[[Kerman carpet|Kerman]]''' is known for finely knotted, elegant carpets with prominent cochineal red, ivory and golden yellow colours. Their medaillons are elegantly designed, and elaborate versions of the boteh design are often seen in the field. 
* '''[[Mashhad rug|Mashhad]]''' carpets are of average quality. Cochineal red is often used. Emogli carpets are made of silk, and represent the finest carpets manufactured in Mashhad. They show dense arabesque patterns on red ground.
* '''[[Kashan rug|Kashan]]''' is the oldest carpet-producing city in Central Iran. Famous for its production of silk carpets, carpet weaving was revived in the late 19th century. The earliest carpets woven in Kashan at the turn of the nineteenth century show some imbalances in their designs, which was overcome, and carpets were produced mainly with a red or ivory field and elaborate ogival central medallions.
* '''[[Isfahan rug|Isfahan]]''', '''[[Nain rug|Nain]]''', and '''[[Qom rug|Qom]]''' revived or started carpet manufacture by the mid-twentieth century. All-silk, or silk pile on cotton foundation carpets are produced with asymmetrical knots. Their design is often inspired by [[Safavid art|Safavid]] designs. Carpets from Qom and Nain often have richly decorated medaillons, and tender light blue and ivory colours. Isfahan carpets use more dark red and blue colours. They count among the finest Persian carpets today with some of them having a knot density of over one million knots per square meter. Some of the master weavers from these cities gained a worldwide reputation like Jamshidi from Qom or Habibian from Nain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.carpet-wiki.com/persian-master-knotters|title=The most popular Persian master knotters|last=Trading|first=Nain|website=www.carpet-wiki.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Commercial aspects ==
[[File:An Iranian Persian carpet exhibition.jpg|thumb|An Iranian/Persian carpet exhibition in city of [[Hamadan]] in 2015.]]
Iran exported $517 million worth of hand woven carpets in 2002. Iran's carpet exports amounted to US$635 million in 2004{{update after|2012|8}}, according to the figures from the state-owned Iran Carpet Company. In October 2006, National Iranian Carpet Center revealed that hand-woven carpets have ranked first in country's non-oil exports and hold the third position among overall exports. Nearly five million workers are engaged in the Iranian carpet industry, making it one of the biggest enterprises in the country.

In recent times Iranian carpets have come under fierce competition from other countries producing fakes of the original Persian designs as well as genuine cheaper substitutes. Most of the problems facing this traditional art is due to absence of patenting and branding the products as well as reduced quality of raw materials in the local market and the consistent loss of original design patterns. The absence of modern [[R&amp;D]] is causing rapid decline in the size as well as market value of this art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/persian/business/story/2007/07/070701_ka-carpet-iranian.shtml BBCPersian.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, President Obama signed into law an act that greatly enhanced restrictions on Iranian-origin imports, causing the imports of Iranian carpets to be frozen.

==Neolithic==

In the book ''[[Inside the Neolithic Mind]]'', the authors, archaeologists [[David Lewis-Williams]] and David Pearce argue that hallucinogenic drugs formed the basis of neolithic religion and rock art. Similar practices and images are found in some contemporary "stone-age" [[Indigenous peoples in South America]] using [[yaje]].

==Ancient Greece==

{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2010}}
Some scholars have suggested that Ancient Greek [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mystery religion]]s employed [[entheogens|entheogen]], such as the [[Kykeon]] central to the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]], to induce a trance or dream state. Research conducted by John R. Hale, Jelle Zeilinga de Boer, Jeffrey P. Chanton and Henry A. Spiller suggests that the prophecies of the [[Delphic Oracle]] were uttered by Priestesses under the influence of gaseous vapors exuded from the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/19/science/for-delphic-oracle-fumes-and-visions.html|title=For Delphic Oracle, Fumes and Visions|last=Broad|first=William J.|date=2002-03-19|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their findings are published in ''Questioning the Delphic Oracle: Overview / An Intoxicating Tale''.

== Buddhism ==
{{see also|Five Precepts|Buddhist ethics|ethic of reciprocity|karma|two truths doctrine}}
In Buddhism the Right [[view (Buddhism)|View]] (''{{IAST|samyag-dṛṣṭi}}'' / ''{{IAST|sammā-diṭṭhi}}'') can also be translated as "right perspective", "right outlook" or "right understanding", is the right way of looking at life, nature, and the world as they really are for us. It is to understand how our reality works. It acts as the reasoning with which someone starts practicing the path. It explains [[five aggregates|the reasons]] for our human existence, suffering, sickness, aging, death, the existence of greed, hatred, and delusion. Right view gives direction and efficacy to the other seven path factors. It begins with concepts and propositional knowledge, but through the practice of right concentration, it gradually becomes transmuted into wisdom, which can eradicate the [[fetter (Buddhism)|fetters of the mind]]. An understanding of right view will inspire the person to lead a virtuous life in line with right view. In the [[Pāli Canon|Pāli]] and [[Chinese Buddhist Canon|Chinese canons]], it is explained thus:&lt;ref name="BSac"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.141.than.html |title=Saccavibhanga Sutta |accessdate=6 May 2008|publisher=Access to Insight |last=Thanissaro Bhikkhu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TSac"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.141.piya.html |title=Saccavibhanga Sutta |accessdate=6 May 2008|publisher=Access to Insight |last=Piyadassi Thera}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thanissaro Bhikkhu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn45/sn45.008.than.html |title=Magga-vibhanga Sutta |accessdate=6 May 2008|publisher=Access to Insight |last=Thanissaro Bhikkhu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbeta.org/result/normal/T01/0026_007.htm |title=Madhyama Agama, Taisho Tripitaka Vol. 1, No. 26, sutra 31 (分別聖諦經第十一) |accessdate=27 October 2008 |publisher=Cbeta |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122103247/http://www.cbeta.org/result/normal/T01/0026_007.htm |archivedate=22 November 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbeta.org/result/normal/T01/0032_001.htm|title=Taisho Tripitaka Vol. 1, No. 32, Page 814|accessdate=27 October 2008|publisher=Cbeta|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122092756/http://www.cbeta.org/result/normal/T01/0032_001.htm|archivedate=22 November 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Right livelihood===
Right livelihood (''samyag-ājīva'' / ''sammā-ājīva''). This means that practitioners ought not to engage in trades or occupations which, either directly or indirectly, result in harm for other living beings. In the Chinese and Pali Canon, it is explained thus:&lt;ref name=BSac/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thanissaro Bhikkhu"/&gt;

{{quote|And what is right livelihood? There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones, having abandoned dishonest livelihood, keeps his life going with right livelihood: This is called right livelihood.}}

More concretely today interpretations include "work and career need to be integrated into life as a Buddhist,"&lt;ref name="triratna"&gt;[http://thebuddhistcentre.com/text/right-livelihood Right Livelihood], The Buddhist Centre: a triratna buddhist community space&lt;/ref&gt; it is also an ethical livelihood, "wealth obtained through rightful means" (Bhikku Basnagoda Rahula) – that means being honest and ethical in business dealings, not to cheat, lie or steal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lewis-richmond/right-livelihood-is-consc_b_832298.html Buddhism and Wealth: Defining 'Right Livelihood'], Huff Post, 16 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; As people are spending most of their time at work, it’s important to assess how our work affects our mind and heart. So important questions include "How can work become meaningful? How can it be a support, not a hindrance, to spiritual practice — a place to deepen our awareness and kindness?"&lt;ref name="triratna"/&gt;

The five types of businesses that should not be undertaken:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an05/an05.177.than.html |title=Vanijja Sutta |accessdate=6 May 2008|publisher=Access to Insight |last=Thanissaro Bhikkhu }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bogoda/wheel397.html |title=A Simple Guide to Life |accessdate=6 May 2008|publisher=Buddhist Publication Society |last=Robert Bogoda}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/price/wheel363.html |title=Two Dialogues on Dhamma |accessdate=6 May 2008|publisher=Buddhist Publication Society |last=Robert Bogoda}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Business in weapons: [[Arms industry|trading in all kinds of weapons]] and instruments for killing.
# Business in human beings: [[slave trading]], [[prostitution]], or the buying and selling of children or adults.
# Business in meat: "meat" refers to the bodies of beings after they are killed. This includes breeding animals for slaughter.
# Business in intoxicants: manufacturing or selling [[intoxicating drink]]s or [[addictive drug]]s.
# Business in poison: producing or trading in any kind of [[poison]] or a toxic product designed to kill.

=== The fifth precept ===
According to the fifth precept of the [[The Five Precepts|Pancasila]], [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] are meant to refrain from any quantity of "fermented or distilled beverages" which would prevent mindfulness or cause heedlessness.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |last1=Dahlke |first1=Paul |last2=Sīlācāra |first2=Bhikkhu |last3=Oates |first3=L.R. |last4=Lounsbery |first4=G. Constant |title=The Five Precepts |journal=The Wheel Publication |year=1963 |publisher=Buddhist Publication Society |location=Sri Lanka |volume= |issue=55 |pages= |url=http://www.bps.lk/olib/wh/wh055.pdf |issn=0068-3345 |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Pali]] [[Tipitaka]] the precept is explicitly concerned with [[alcoholic beverage]]s:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I undertake the training rule to abstain from fermented drink that causes heedlessness."
&lt;br /&gt;
''Surāmerayamajjapamādaṭṭhānā veramaṇī sikkhāpadaṃ samādiyāmi.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, [[caffeine]] and [[tea]] are permitted, even encouraged for monks of most traditions, as it is believed to promote wakefulness.

Generally speaking, the vast majority of Buddhists and Buddhist sects denounce and have historically frowned upon the use of any intoxicants by an individual who has taken the five precepts. Most Buddhists view the use and abuse of intoxicants to be a hindrance in the development of an [[Bodhicitta|enlightened mind]]. However, there are a few historical and doctrinal exceptions.

=== Vajrayana ===

{{see also|Skillful means|ganachakra|amrita}}

Many modern Buddhist schools have strongly discouraged the use of psychoactive drugs of any kind; however, they may not be prohibited in all circumstances in all traditions. Some denominations of [[Tantric Buddhism|tantric]] or esoteric Buddhism especially exemplify the latter, often with the principle [[skillful means]]:

==== Alcohol ====

For example, as part of the  [[ganachakra]] ''tsok'' ritual (as well as [[Homa (ritual)|Homa]], [[abhisheka]] and sometimes [[drubchen]]) some [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhists]] and [[Bön]]pos have been known to ingest small amounts of [[grain alcohol|grain]] [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] (called ''amrit'' or ''[[amrita#Buddhism|amrita]]'') as an offering. If a member is an alcoholic, or for some other reason does not wish to partake in the drinking of the alcoholic offering, then he or she may dip a finger in the alcohol and then flick it three times as [[Tsok#Alcohol in Vajrayana|part of the ceremony]].

Amrita is also possibly the same as, or at least in some sense a conceptual derivative of the ancient Hindu ''[[soma (drink)|soma]]''. (The latter which historians often equate with ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'' or other ''[[Amanita]]'' [[psychoactive drug|psychoactive]] [[fungi]].) Crowley (1996) states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Undoubtedly, the striking parallels between "The legend about Chakdor" and the Hindu legend of the origin of soma show that the Buddhist amrita and the Hindu soma were at one time understood to be identical. Moreover, the principal property of amrita is, to this day, perceived by Buddhists as being a species of inebriation, however symbolically this inebriation may be interpreted. Why else would beer (Tibetan ''chhang'', "barley beer") be used by yogins as a symbolic substitute for amrita [Ardussi]? Conversely, why else would the term bDud.rTsi be used as a poetic synonym for [[beer]]?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Conversely, in [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] and [[Sherpa people|Sherpa]] lore there is a story about a monk who came across a woman who told him that he must either:
* '''a.''' kill her goat,
* '''b.''' sleep with her, or
* '''c.''' drink a mug of [[beer]].
* '''d.''' All of the above.

The monk thought to himself, "''well, surely if I kill the goat then I will be causing great suffering since a living being will die. If I sleep with the woman then I will have broken another great vow of a monk and will surely be lost to the ways of the world. Lastly, if I drink the beer then perhaps no great harm will come and I will only be intoxicated for a while, and most importantly I will only be hurting myself.''" (In the context of the story this instance is of particular importance to him because monks in the Mahayana and Vajrayana [[bodhicitta|try to bring all sentient beings to enlightenment]] as part of their goal.)

So the monk drank the mug of beer and then he became very drunk. In his drunkenness he proceeded to kill the woman and sleep with the goat, breaking all three vows and, at least in his eyes, doing much harm in the world. The lesson of this story is meant to be that, at least according to the cultures from which it delineates, alcohol causes one to break all of one's vows, in a sense that one could say it is the cause of all other harmful deeds.&lt;ref&gt;one place this story is referenced is in the more Western article 'Sherpa Purity' by Sherry B. Ortner, published in the magazine American Anthropologist. The beginning of that article is available online, here: https://www.jstor.org/pss/672339 but the story is not available unless you login etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vajrayana]] teacher Drupon Thinley Ningpo [[Rinpoche]] has said that as part of the five precepts which a layperson takes upon [[Refuge (Buddhism)|taking refuge]], that although they must refrain from taking intoxicants, they may drink enough so as they do not become drunk. [[Bhikku]]s and [[Bhikkuni]]s (monks and nuns, respectively), on the other hand, who have taken the [[Five Precepts#Ten Precepts|ten vows]] as part of taking refuge and becoming ordained, cannot imbibe any amount of alcohol or other drugs, other than [[pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceutical]]s taken as medicine.

[[14th Dalai Lama|Tenzin Gyatso]], the 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet, is known as teetotaler and non-smoker.

==== Hallucinogens ====
{{see also|Dzogchen|Rahu|tantrism}}

There is some evidence regarding the use of [[deliriant]] ''[[Datura]]'' seeds (known as ''candabija'') in Dharmic rituals associated with many [[tantras]] – namely the  ''Vajramahabhairava'', ''Samputa'', ''Mahakala'', ''Guhyasamaja'', ''Tara'' and ''Krsnayamari'' tantras – as well as [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] and other [[entheogens]] in minority Vajrayana [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sanghas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vajrayana.faithweb.com/rich_text_5.html|title=Entheogens in the Vajrayana Tradition|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ronald M Davidson says that in Indian Vajrayana, [[Datura]] was:

&lt;blockquote&gt;“employed as a narcotic paste or as wood in a fire ceremony and could be easily absorbed through the skin or the lungs. The seeds of this powerful narcotic, termed "passion seeds"  (candabija), are the strongest elements and contain the alkaloids hyoscine, hyoscyamine, and atropine in forms that survive burning or boiling. In even moderate doses, datura can render a person virtually immobile with severe belladonna-like [[hallucinations]].”&lt;ref&gt;Ronald M Davidson 2002, Indian Esoteric Buddhism: a social history of the Tantric movement (datura and betel)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the ''Profound Summarizing Notes on the Path Presented as the Three Continua'' a [[Sakya]] [[Lamdre]] text, by [[Jamyang Khyentse Wangchuk]] (1524-1568), the use of [[Datura]] in combination with other substances, is prescribed as part of a meditation practice meant to establish that "All the phenomena included in apparent existence, samsara and nirvana, are not established outside of one's mind."&lt;ref&gt;Stearns, Cyrus; Taking the Result as the Path: Core Teachings of the Sakya Lamdre Tradition (Library of Tibetan Classics), 2006, page 421, 432.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ian Baker writes that Tibetan terma literature such as the [[Vima Nyingtik]] describes "various concoctions of mind altering substances, including datura and oleander, which can be formed into pills or placed directly in the eyes to induce visions and illuminate hidden contents of the psyche."&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Ian; The Heart of the World: A Journey to Tibet's Lost Paradise, Part Three, Hell night&lt;/ref&gt;

A book titled ''Zig Zag Zen: Buddhism and Psychedelics'' (2002), details the history of Buddhism and the use of psychedelic drugs, and includes essays by modern Buddhist teachers on the topic.

=== Zen ===

[[Zen Buddhism]] is known for stressing the precepts. [[Buddhism in Japan|In Japan]], however, where Zen flourished historically, there are a number of examples of misconduct on the part of monks and [[Laity|laypeople]] alike. This often involved the use of alcohol, as [[sake]] drinking has and continues to be a well known aspect of [[Japanese culture]].

The Japanese Zen monk and abbot, [[shakuhachi]] player and poet [[Ikkyu]] was known for his unconventional take on [[Zen Buddhism]]: His style of expressing [[dharma]] is sometimes deemed "Red Thread Zen" or "Crazy Cloud Zen" for its unorthodox characteristics. Ikkyu is considered both a heretic and saint in the [[Rinzai]] Zen tradition, and was known for his derogatory poetry, open [[alcoholism]] and for frequenting the services of [[prostitutes]] in [[brothels]]. He personally found no conflict between his lifestyle and Buddhism.

There are several [[koans]] (Zen riddles) referencing the drinking of sake ([[rice wine]]); for instance [[Mumonkan]]'s tenth koan titled ''Seizei Is Utterly Destitute'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'Seizei said to Sozan, "Seizei is utterly destitute. Will you give him support?" Sozan called out: "Seizei!" Seizei responded, "Yes sir?!" Sozan said, "You have finished three cups of the finest wine in China, and still you say you have not yet moistened your lips!"'
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another monk, Gudo, is mentioned in a koan called ''Finding a Diamond on a Muddy Road'' buying a gallon of sake.

==Judaism==
Judaism maintains that people do not own their bodies – they belong to God. As a result, Jews are not permitted to harm, mutilate, destroy or take risks with their bodies, life or health with activities such as taking life-threatening drugs. However, there is no general prohibition against drugs in Judaism, as long as they don't interfere with one's ritual duties and don't cause definite harm, though most Rabbis generally prohibit drugs, in order to avoid social, legal and medical problems in their community.

Spiritual use of various alcoholic beverages, sometimes in very large quantities, is common and well known. In some Jewish communities there is a tradition to get drunk on [[Purim]] until they forget the difference between the Hebrew phrases "Cursed is Haman" and "Blessed is Mordechai", which signified reaching the spiritual world [[Atzilut]] where all opposites unite. In many Jewish communities it is customary to drink on [[Simchat Torah]] as well. Drinking in small quantities as a mind-altering practice is commonly used during the [[Chabad|Farbrengens]] of the [[Chabad]] [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidim]]. A large body of Chabad literature refers to the spiritual dangers of drinking, but a few anecdotal references refer to the spirutal power of alcohol, when used for the sake of connecting to God and achieving brotherly love among fellows Jews.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} The Lubavitcher Rebbe forbade his Chassidim under the age of 40 to consume more than 4 small shots of hard liqueurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oztorah.com/2007/08/drugs-judaism/|title=Drugs &amp; Judaism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Wine]] plays a prominent role in many Jewish rituals, most notably the [[kiddush]].
Hasidic Jews often engage in a free ceremony called "Tisch" in which drinks such as Vodka are drunk in a group. Drinking is accompanied by singing and the study of the Torah.

Some Hasidic Rabbis, e.g. the [[Chaim Zanvl Abramowitz|Ribnitzer Rebbe]] used to drink large amounts of [[Vodka]] on some special occasions, apparently as a powerful mind-altering method. The [[Chaim Zanvl Abramowitz|Ribnitzer Rebbe]] also practiced severe [[sleep deprivation]], extremely long meditative prayers and a number of ascetic purification rituals. During his life in the [[USSR]] he used to immerse himself every day in ice water.

The spiritual use of [[caffeine]] and [[nicotine]] as stimulants is well known in the Hasidic communities. Many stories are told about miracles and spiritual journeys performed by the [[Baal Shem Tov]] and other famous [[Tzaddik]]im with the help of their smoking pipe. Some people suggest that, judging by the nature of these stories, the tobacco was sometimes mixed with strong mind-altering drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/practices/Ethics/Our_Bodies/Health_and_Healing/Smoking_Alcohol_and_Drugs/Tobacco.shtml|title=Tobacco|work=My Jewish Learning}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cannabischassidis.blogspot.com/2005_02_01_archive.html|title=Cannabis Chassidis|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A popular Hasidic saying relates coffee to the Psalmic verse "Hope in God". The Hebrew word for "hope" ("Kave") sounds identical to the Yiddish word for coffee. Coffee is believed to have power to awaken the soul to the worship of God.

Some [[Kabbalists]], including [[Isaac ben Samuel of Acre|Isaac of Acco]] and [[Abraham Abulafia]], mention a method of "philosophical meditation", which involves drinking a cup of "strong wine of [[Avicenna]]", which would induce a [[trance]] and would help the adept to ponder over difficult philosophical questions.&lt;ref&gt;Aryeh Kaplan, Meditation and Kabbalah, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; The exact recipe of this wine remains unknown; Avicenna refers in his works to the effects of [[opium]] and [[datura]] extracts.

Rabbi [[Aryeh Kaplan]], a prominent researcher of Jewish meditations, suggested that some medieval Kabbalists may have used some psychedelic drugs&lt;ref&gt;Aryeh Kaplan, Meditation and Kabbalah, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, one can find in Kabbalistic medical manuals cryptic references to the hidden powers of [[Mandragora officinarum|mandrake]], [[harmal]] and other psychoactive plants, though the exact usage of these powers is hard to decipher.

According to [[Aryeh Kaplan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaplan|first=Aryeh|title=[[The Living Torah]]|location=New York|year=1981|page=442|isbn=0-940118-35-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; cannabis was an ingredient in the [[Holy anointing oil]] mentioned in various sacred [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] texts.  The herb of interest is most commonly known as ''kaneh-bosem'' (קְנֵה-בֹשֶׂם&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cannabisculture.com/backissues/cc11/christ.html |title=Cannabis and the Christ: Jesus used Marijuana |work=[[Cannabis Culture (magazine)|Cannabis Culture]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822175502/http://www.cannabisculture.com/backissues/cc11/christ.html |archivedate=2009-08-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;) which is mentioned several times in the [[Old Testament]] as a bartering material, incense, and an ingredient in Holy anointing oil used by the high priest of the temple. Many [[Rastafarians]], who use cannabis as a sacrament, identify as Jewish.

According to [[Josephus]], the head-dress of the Jewish High Priests' was modeled upon the capsule of the [[Hyoscyamus niger|Hyoscyamus]] flower, which he calls "Saccharus". This Greek word for sugar stems from the Hebrew root that means "intoxicating".&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, Antiquities, Book III, 7:6&lt;/ref&gt;

Benny Shanon, a psychology professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, proposed that Moses may have been high on hallucinogenic mushrooms at the time he received the Ten Commandments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-525993/Moses-high-hallucinogenic-drug-received-Ten-Commandments-claims-academic.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title='Moses was high on hallucinogenic drug when he received Ten Commandments,' claims top academic | date=2008-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christianity==
{{see also|Christian views on alcohol|}}

Many [[Christian]] denominations disapprove of the use of most illicit drugs. Many denominations permit the moderate use of socially and legally acceptable drugs like [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], [[caffeine]] and [[tobacco]]. Some [[Christian]] denominations permit smoking [[tobacco]], while others disapprove of it. Many denominations do not have any official stance on drug use, some more-recent Christian denominations (e.g. [[Mormons]], [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]] and [[Jehovah’s Witnesses]]) discourage or prohibit the use of any of these substances.

Because [[Jesus]] and many Biblical figures drank [[wine]], most [[Christian]] denominations do not require [[teetotalism]]. In the Eucharist, wine represents (or among [[Christian]]s who believe in some form of [[Real Presence]], like the Catholic, Lutheran and Orthodox churches, actually ''is'') the blood of Christ. Lutherans believe in the real presence of the body and blood of Christ in the Eucharist,&lt;ref name=WELSparticipation&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&amp;cuTopic_topicID=814&amp;cuItem_itemID=1045 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080102081951/https://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&amp;cuTopic_topicID=814&amp;cuItem_itemID=1045 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2 January 2008 |work=WELS Topical Q&amp;A |title=1 Corinthians 10:16 - Meaning of "Participation |publisher=[[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] |accessdate=4 Feb 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WELSQA&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&amp;cuTopic_topicID=258&amp;cuItem_itemID=8633 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080102005853/https://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&amp;cuTopic_topicID=258&amp;cuItem_itemID=8633 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2 January 2008 |work=WELS Topical Q&amp;A |title=Beliefs of other Church |publisher=[[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] |quote=As [[Confessional Lutheran]]s we believe in baptismal regeneration, the real presence of Christ's body and blood in the Lord's Supper, and infant baptism. |accessdate=4 Feb 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; that the body and blood of Christ are "truly and substantially present in, with and under the forms."&lt;ref name=WLS-Real&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wlsessays.net/files/BrugReal.pdf |title=The Real Presence of Christ’s Body and Blood in The Lord's Supper: Contemporary Issues Concerning the Sacramental Union |last=Brug |first=John F. |publisher=[[Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary]] |quote=Lutherans have always emphasized that Christ's true body and blood are really present "in, with, and under" the bread and wine and that Christ's true body and blood are received by all who receive the elements, either to their blessing or to their condemnation...Lutherans emphasize that although the presence of Christ in the Sacrament is a supernatural presence, which is beyond our understanding and explanations, it is a real, substantial presence.

On the other hand, some [[Protestant]] Christian denominations, such as [[Baptist]]s and [[Methodist]]s associated with the [[temperance movement]], encourage or require teetotalism. In some Protestant denomination, grape juice or non-alcoholic wine is used in place of wine to represent the blood of Christ.
 
The best known Western prohibition against alcohol happened in the United States in the 1920s, where concerned prohibitionists were worried about its dangerous side effects. However, the demand for alcohol remained and criminals stepped in and created the supply. The consequences of organized crime and the popular demand for alcohol, led to alcohol being legalized again.

==Islam==

Islam prohibits all drugs that are not medically prescribed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Islam: Drugs|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/rs/sanctity/isdrugsrev2.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islam's prohibition of drugs&lt;ref name=IslamO1&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Yusuf Al-Qaradawi]]|title=Islam Prohibits Alcohol and Drugs|url=http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&amp;cid=1119503545310}}&lt;/ref&gt; stems from two concerns:
*their intoxication effects
*their harm to the human body

There are numerous verses in the Qur'an and hadith that ban ''[[khamr]]'' (intoxicants, including [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]]). [[Muhammad]] said:&lt;ref name=IslamO1/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Every intoxicant is like alcohol, and every (type of) alcohol is prohibited. ([[Sahih Muslim|Muslim]])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The second reason for banning drugs is that they are believed to have a harmful effect on the body. The Qur'an says,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"And make not your own hands contribute to your destruction." Surah, Al-Baqara, 2: 195&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Muslim nations of Turkey and Egypt were instrumental in banning [[opium]], [[cocaine]], and [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] when the [[League of Nations]] committed to the 1925 International Convention relating to opium and other drugs (later the 1934 Dangerous Drugs Act). The primary goal was to ban opium and cocaine, but cannabis was added to the list, and it remained there largely unnoticed due to the much more heated debate over opium and coca. The 1925 Act has been the foundation upon which every subsequent policy in the [[United Nations]] has been founded. Cannabis use and abuse as an intoxicant was largely unknown in the West at that point, but Islamic leaders have been critical of it since the 13th century.

O You who believe! Intoxicants and gambling, (dedication of) stones and (divination by) arrows are an abomination of Satan’s handiwork. Avoid (such abominations) that you may prosper. (5:90)

Satan’s plan is to sow hatred and enmity amongst you with intoxicants and gambling, and to hamper you from the remembrance of Allah and from prayer. Will you not give up? (5:91)

There are no prohibitions in Islam on alcohol for scientific, industrial or automotive use.

In spite of these restrictions on substance use, tobacco and caffeine are still widely used throughout many Muslim nations.

==Bahá'í Faith==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2010}}
[[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]] are forbidden to drink [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] or to take drugs, unless prescribed by doctors.  Accordingly, the sale and trafficking of such substances is also forbidden.  Smoking is discouraged but not prohibited.

==Rastafari movement==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2010}}
Many [[Rastafari movement|Rastafari]] believe [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], which they call "ganja," "the herb," or "Kaya," is a sacred gift of [[Jah]]. It may be used for spiritual purposes to commune with God, but should not be used profanely. The use of other drugs, however, including alcohol, is frowned upon. Many believe that the wine Jesus/Iyesus drank was not an alcoholic beverage, but simply the juice of grapes or other fruits.

While some Rastafari suggest that the Bible may refer to marijuana, it is generally held by academics specializing in the archaeology and paleobotany of [[Ancient Israel]], and those specializing in the lexicography of the [[Hebrew Bible]], that cannabis is not documented or mentioned in early Judaism. Against this some popular writers&lt;ref&gt;Dan Merkur ''The Mystery of Manna: The Psychedelic Sacrament of the Bible'' (2001); James D. Dure, ''Manna Magic Mushroom of Moses : Manna Botanical I.D. of a Biblical Sacrament'' (self published, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that there is evidence for religious use of cannabis in the Hebrew Bible, although this hypothesis and some of the specific case studies (e.g., [[John Allegro]] in relation to [[Qumran]], 1970) have been "widely dismissed as erroneous" (Merlin, 2003).&lt;ref&gt;[[Economic Botany]] [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1663/0013-0001(2003)057%5B0295:AEFTTO%5D2.0.CO%3B2#page-1  M. D. Merlin  Archaeological Evidence for the Tradition of Psychoactive Plant Use in the Old World - University of Hawaii] "23 May 2011 - ".. Judaism (Dure 2001; Merkur 2000), and Christianity (Allegro 1970; Ruck et al. 2001). Although this hypothesis and some of the specific case studies (e.g., Allegro 1970) have been widely dismissed as erroneous, others continue"&lt;/ref&gt; The primary advocate of a religious use of cannabis plant in early Judaism was [[Sula Benet]] (1967), who claimed that the plant ''kaneh bosm קְנֵה-בֹשֶׂם'' mentioned five times in the Hebrew Bible, and used in the [[holy anointing oil]] of the Book of Exodus, was in fact cannabis,&lt;ref&gt;Rowan Robinson, The Great Book of Hemp, Health &amp; Fitness, 1995, pag. 89&lt;/ref&gt; although lexicons of Hebrew and dictionaries of plants of the Bible such as by [[Michael Zohary]] (1985), [[Hans Arne Jensen]] (2004) and [[James A. Duke]] (2010) and others identify the plant in question as either ''[[Acorus calamus]]'' or ''[[Cymbopogon citratus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Lytton J. Musselman ''Figs, dates, laurel, and myrrh: plants of the Bible and the Quran'' 2007 p73&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reasoning ===
A "reasoning" is a simple event where the Rastas gather, smoke cannabis ("ganja"), and discuss. The person honored by being allowed to light the herb says a short sentence beforehand. The ganja is passed in a clockwise fashion (passing 'pon the lef' han' side) except in times of war, when it is passed counterclockwise. It is used to reason with Jah.

=== Groundation ===
A "groundation" (also spelled "grounation") or "binghi" is a holy day; the name "binghi" is derived from "Nyabinghi" (literally "Nya" meaning "black" and "Binghi" meaning "victory"). Binghis are marked by much dancing, singing, feasting, and the smoking of "ganja", and can last for several days.

=== Bible verses which Rastas believe justify cannabis use ===
...thou shalt eat the herb of the field.

Genesis 3.18

...eat every herb of the land.

Exodus 10:12

Better is a dinner of herb where love is, than a stalled ox and hatred therewith.

Proverbs 15:17

=== Beliefs about other drugs ===
According to many Rastas, the illegality of cannabis in many nations is evidence of persecution of Rastafari. They are not surprised that it is illegal, viewing Cannabis as a powerful substance that opens people's minds to the truth – something the Babylon system, they reason, clearly does not want. Cannabis use is contrasted with the use of alcohol and other drugs, which they feel destroy the mind.

==Asatru==
Alcoholic drinks are commonly used during Asatru blots but non-alcoholic drinks can be substituted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ravenkindred.com/RBRituals.html|title=The Rituals of Asatru|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.tripod.com/heathen_home/faq.html#11]&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Saint of Me'''" is a [[single (music)|single]] by [[The Rolling Stones]] from their 1997 album ''[[Bridges to Babylon]]''. [[Mick Jagger]] sings about various people in history who had converted to [[Christianity]], notably [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]] and [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]]. Jagger then states that they will never make a [[saint]] out of him.

==Recording==
The song is notable for its performers. With Jagger on vocals, acoustic guitar and keyboards, [[Waddy Wachtel]] and [[Ron Wood]] play electric guitars ([[Keith Richards]] is notably absent), [[Me'Shell Ndegéocello]] and Pierre de Beauport on bass and six-string bass, respectively, and Stones-recording veteran [[Billy Preston]] on organ.

==Release==
"Saint of Me" reached #26 in the UK and #94 in the US. The track also reached #13 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks.

A recording from the [[Bridges to Babylon Tour]] can be found on the 1998 [[live album]] ''[[No Security]]''.

The B-side, "Anyway You Look at It", is a ballad and appears on the ''[[Rarities 1971–2003]]'' compilation, released in 2005.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5740">'''Salome''' ({{lang-hy|Սալոմե}}, {{lang-ka|სალომე}}; born sometime after 297, died about 361) was an Armenian princess{{sfn|Wardrop|2006|p=71}}{{sfn|Rapp|2003|p=218 &amp; 295}} [[Arsacid dynasty of Armenia|from the Arsacid dynasty]] who was married into the [[Chosroid Dynasty]] of [[Caucasian Iberia|Iberia]].{{sfn|Wardrop|2006|p=7}} She was a daughter of King [[Tiridates III of Armenia]] and Queen [[Ashkhen]]. She had a brother called [[Khosrov III the Small|Khosrov III]] and an unnamed sister who married [[St. Husik I]], one of the earlier [[Catholicos|Catholicoi]] of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]]. She has been canonized by the Armenian and [[Georgian Orthodox Church|Georgian]] churches. In Georgian tradition, she is referred to as Salome of Ujarma (სალომე უჯარმელი, ''salome ujarmeli'') after a castle where she is credited to have erected a cross.

==Biography==
Her birthplace in Armenia is unknown and little is known on her early life. Salome was born at an unknown date sometime after 297. Her birth name was ''Beoun''{{sfn|Wardrop|2006|p=71}} and changed her name to ''Salome'' after she married [[Rev II of Iberia]].{{sfn|Wardrop|2006|p=71}} Rev II was the first son of King [[Mirian III of Iberia]] and his second wife, Queen [[Nana of Iberia]]. Mirian III ruled as King of Iberia from 284 until his death in 361. Rev II co-ruled with his father as co-king from 345 until 361.

Mirian III established peaceful relations with the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Constantine the Great]] and Tiridates III, after Constantine declared [[Christianity]] as the official head religion of the [[Roman Empire]]. In result of Mirian III’s established relations, he arranged for Rev II to marry Salome{{sfn|Rapp|2003|p=295}} in 326. Through marriage, Salome became a Queen of Iberia who co-ruled with Rev II and her in-laws from 345 until 361. Salome bore Rev II two sons: [[Sauromaces II of Iberia|Saurmag II]] and [[Trdat of Iberia|Trdat, also known as Tiridates]].{{sfn|Rapp|2003|p=218}} Through her sons, Salome and Rev II would have further descendants.

Rev II had an [[appanage]] at Ujarma where she lived with her husband and their family. Prior to converting to Christianity, Salome was a follower of [[Zoroastrianism]]. Salome in 337 played a role in the conversion of Iberia to Christianity. Salome is a contemporary and is associated with the life of [[Saint Nino]]. Saint Nino was the woman who converted [[Caucasian Iberians|Iberians]] to the [[Christian]] faith.

Salome along with Perozhavra of Sivnia a noblewoman who was married to the ruler of the [[Kartli]] region, were the helpers and closest companions of Saint Nino. Both women while serving in their imperial roles, succeeded in serving Saint Nino.&lt;ref name="Pravoslavie"&gt;[http://www.pravoslavie.ru/english/7382.htm Saints Salome of Ujarma and Perozhavra of Sivnia (4th century) Memory 15 (28) January]&lt;/ref&gt; Saint Nino taught Salome and Perozhavra to pray; the women fasted regularly and both women performed good works. As Salome and Perozhavra were women of influential social status&lt;ref name="Pravoslavie"/&gt; they both assisted Saint Nino in spreading the Christian faith.

After the whole Iberian royal family were converted to Christianity by Saint Nino from the orders of Mirian III, Salome erected a cross in Ujarma.&lt;ref name="Pravoslavie"/&gt; When Saint Nino fell ill at [[Bodbe Monastery|the village of Bodbe]], Salome and Perozhavra stood by Saint Nino’s bed and wept bitterly as she was dying. On her death bed, Saint Nino told Salome and Perozhavra her life story. Saint Nino died sometime between 338-340.

As a dedication to honor the memory of Saint Nino; as a continuation of the works of Saint Nino and continue the spread of Christianity in Iberia, Salome and Perozhavra wrote a biography{{sfn|Wardrop|2006|p=7}} on her life titled ''Saint Nino, The Life of Saint Nino, Enlightener of Georgia''.&lt;ref name="Pravoslavie"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antiochian.org/book/export/html/7640 St. Salome and St. Perozhavra of Ojarma Commemorated on 15 January at The Self-Ruled Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of North America]&lt;/ref&gt;

Salome died at an unknown date about 361, around the same time that her husband died. Salome, along with Perozhavra, are Saints in the [[Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch]] and the [[Georgian Orthodox Church]]. Their feast day is on 15 January, the day following the commemoration of Saint Nino.

The '''Sanchi Yakshi Figure''' is a sandstone statue of the [[Shalabhanjika]] [[Yakshi]] from the ancient Buddhist site of [[Sanchi]] in the state of [[Madhya Pradesh]], India. One of the earliest Buddhist sculptures from the [[Indian subcontinent]], it has been part of the [[British Museum]]'s collection since 1842.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=226080&amp;partId=1&amp;place=40492&amp;plaA=40492-3-2&amp;page=1 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/asia/s/sandstone_figure_of_shalabhanj.aspx British Museum Highlights]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==
The bejewelled figure of the [[yakshi]] was originally installed on one of the gateways that surrounded the Great [[Stupa]] at Sanchi, which is said to have contained the relics of the [[Buddha]]. In the 1st century AD four [[torana]]s or large gateways were erected around the stupa, which served as the main entrances to a circular processional walkway that surrounded the holy building. Made of [[sandstone]], the gateways were elaborately decorated with some of the earliest surviving forms of buddhist [[iconography]]. The beam of the western gateway was originally supported by this bracket figure.  During the preliminary excavations at the site in the early nineteenth century, it came into the possession of a Mrs Tucker, who donated it to the British Museum in 1842. One of the few figures from the site in the [[Western World|West]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.org/collections/object/torso-of-a-fertility-goddess-yakshi-from-the-great-stupa-at-sanchi-17530 The Boston Museum of Fine Arts has another Sanchi figure]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://collections.lacma.org/node/250015 The Los Angeles County Museum of Art has two similar figures]&lt;/ref&gt; it remains one of the most important early [[Buddhist]] sculptures in the museum's collection.

[[File:Northern Gate, Sanchi Stupa built in 3rd century BC.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Detail of the northern gate at Sanchi, with similar yakshi brackets below the upper and middle beams.]]

==Description==
Carved in white sandstone, the almost nude figure of the yakshi figure is shown clasping onto the branches of a tree with her arms, with her right leg wrapped around its [[Trunk (botany)|trunk]]. She is weighed down with ornate [[jewellery]] around her neck, waist and ankles. The sculpture also acted as an [[architectural]] bracket, supporting a long sandstone [[Beam (structure)|beam]] that once ran above the yakshi's head. The [[Shalabhanjika]] Yakshi thus served two purposes: as a fertility [[symbol]] associated with the vitality of the fruit-bearing tree and as a structural element supporting the whole configuration of the gateway.

{{Redirect|Sadguru|Sadguru (disambiguation)}}
'''Satguru''' ({{lang-sa|सद्गुरू}}), or '''sadguru''', means the true [[guru]]. However the term is distinguished from other forms of gurus, such as musical instructors, scriptural teachers, parents, and so on. The satguru is a title given specifically only to an enlightened [[rishi]] or [[saint]] whose life's purpose is to guide the initiated ''[[Guru-shishya tradition|shishya]]'' on the spiritual path, the summation of which is the realization of the [[Self (spirituality)|Self]] through realization of [[God]].

A Satguru has some special characteristics that are not found in any other types of Spiritual Guru. The words 'Sant' and 'Satguru' firstly came into existence from the spiritual ideology of “Sant Samrat Satguru Kabir Sahib” in the 15th century. Kabir Sahib says "Satpurush Ko Jansi, Tiska Satguru Naam|" meaning the one who has seen the supreme lord of truth- Satya Purush is Satguru.&lt;ref&gt;'Kabir Sagara'&lt;/ref&gt;  "Devi dewal jagat mein, kotik poojey koye. Satguru ki pooja kiye, sabb ki pooja hoye".&lt;ref&gt;Kabir Sagara&lt;/ref&gt; Kabir Sahib says Worship of Satguru includes in it worship of all deities. In other words, Satguru is physical form of God (Sat Pursh).

== Ancient and traditional sources ==
The recommendation says that the first and the foremost qualification of the True Master (Satguru) is that he must have known the True Lord ([[God]]) himself.&lt;ref&gt;[[Adi Granth]]: 286&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of [[Kabir]]'s songs&lt;ref&gt;LVI I. 68. bhâi kôî satguru sant kahâwaî&lt;/ref&gt; the satguru is described as the real [[sadhu]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
He is the real Sadhu, who can reveal the form of the Formless to the vision of these eyes;
Who teaches the simple way of attaining Him, that is other than rites or ceremonies;
Who does not make you close the doors, and hold the breath, and renounce the world;
Who makes you perceive the Supreme Spirit wherever the mind attaches itself;
Who teaches you to be still in the midst of all your activities.
Ever immersed in bliss, having no fear in his mind, he keeps the spirit of union in the midst of all enjoyments.
The infinite dwelling of the Infinite Being is everywhere: in earth, water, sky, and air;
Firm as the thunderbolt, the seat of the seeker is established above the void.
He who is within is without: I see Him and none else.&lt;ref&gt;''Songs of Kabir'' LVI, I. 68  - Translated by [[Rabindranath Tagore]] New York, The Macmillan Company (1915)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Vasistha]], [[Rama]]'s guru, was the satguru in the [[Treta yuga]]. Swami Shankar Purushottam Tirtha quotes the ''[[Yoga Vasistha]]'':
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;A real preceptor is one who can produce blissful sensation in the body of the disciple by their sight, touch, or instructions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Tirtha | first = Swami Shankar Purushottam | authorlink = Swami Shankar Purushottam Tirtha | coauthors = | title = Yoga Vani: Instructions for the Attainment of Siddhayoga | publisher = Sat Yuga Press | year = 1992 | location = New York | pages = 27 | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to [[Sivaya Subramuniyaswami]], a Hindu satguru is always a ''[[sannyasa|sannyasin]]'', an unmarried renunciate,&lt;ref&gt;Subramuniyaswami, Satguru Sivaya.

[[Meher Baba]] equated worship of the Satguru with worship of God: "Consciously or unconsciously, directly or indirectly, each and every creature, each and every human being — in one form or the other — strives to assert individuality. But when eventually man consciously experiences that he is Infinite, Eternal and Indivisible, then he is fully conscious of his individuality as God, and as such experiences Infinite Knowledge, Infinite Power and Infinite Bliss. Thus Man becomes God, and is recognized as a [[Perfect Master (Meher Baba)|Perfect Master]], Satguru, or [[Qutb|Kutub]]. To worship this Man is to worship God."&lt;ref&gt;[[Meher Baba|Baba, Meher]] (2000).

{{Japanese name|Itagaki}}
{{nihongo|'''Seishirō Itagaki'''|板垣 征四郎|Itagaki Seishirō|extra=21 January 1885 – 23 December 1948}} was a General in the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] in [[World War II]] and a [[Ministry of War of Japan|War Minister]]. Convicted of war crimes, he was executed in 1948.

==Overview==
Itagaki was born in [[Morioka, Iwate|Morioka city]], [[Iwate prefecture]] into a ''[[samurai]]'' class family formerly serving the [[Nanbu clan]] of [[Morioka Domain]]. He graduated from the [[Imperial Japanese Army Academy]] in 1904. He fought in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] in 1904–1905.

From 1924-1926, Itagaki was a [[military attaché]] assigned to the Japanese embassy in [[China]]. On his return to Japan, he held a number of staff positions within the [[Imperial Japanese Army General Staff]] during 1926–1927 before being given a field command as commanding officer of the IJA 33rd Infantry Brigade based in China. His brigade was attached to the [[IJA 10th Division]] from 1927–1928. Itagaki was then transferred to command the IJA 33rd Infantry Regiment in China from 1928–1929, under the aegis of the [[Kwantung Army]].

Itagaki rose to become Chief of the Intelligence Section of the Kwantung Army from 1931, in which capacity he helped plan the 1931 [[Mukden Incident]] that led to the Japanese seizure of [[Manchuria]].&lt;ref&gt;Budge, the Pacific War Online Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt; He was subsequently a military advisor to [[Manchukuo]] from 1932–1934.

Itagaki became Vice Chief of Staff of the [[Kwantung Army]] from 1934, and [[Chief of staff (military)|Chief of Staff]] in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Ammenthorp, The Generals of World War II&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1937 to 1938 Itagaki was commander of the [[IJA 5th Division]] in China during the early part of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. His Division took a leading part in the [[Battle of Beiping-Tianjin]], [[Operation Chahar]], and the [[Battle of Taiyuan]]. However, in the [[Battle of Xuzhou]] his forces were repulsed during the [[Battle of Taierzhuang]] in the vicinity of [[Linyi]] that prevented them from coming to the aid of [[Rensuke Isogai]]'s [[IJA 10th Division]].&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, Shokan, Hirohito's Samurai&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Yonai, Itagaki, Tojo.jpg|thumb|left|The newly appointed War Minister Itagaki (center, stepping down from the rock) with his vice-minister [[Hideki Tōjō]] (right) and Navy minister [[Mitsumasa Yonai]] (left, in black Navy uniform, standing on the rock)]]

Recalled to Japan in 1938, Itagaki briefly served as [[Ministry of War of Japan|War Minister]] from 1938-1939. On December 6, 1938, Itagaki proposed a national policy in accordance with ''[[Hakko Ichiu]]'' (Expansion) at the Five Ministers Conference,&lt;ref name=wakase&gt;{{cite book |author=Kazutomo Wakase |title=続・日本人が知ってはならない歴史 |year=2007 |publisher=朱鳥社 |pages=41 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UZ7WmRRY8ukC&amp;pg=PA41 |isbn=4-434-11358-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was the Japanese highest decision making council,&lt;ref name=mof&gt;{{cite web | title=Question 戦前の日本における対ユダヤ人政策の基本をなしたと言われる「ユダヤ人対策要綱」に関する史料はありますか。また、同要綱に関する説明文はありますか。  | publisher = [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan]] | url = http://www.mofa.go.jp/mofaj/annai/honsho/shiryo/qa/senzen_03.html |accessdate = 2010-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gosho&gt;{{cite web | title = 猶太人対策要綱 | work = Five ministers council | publisher = [[National Archives of Japan|Japan Center for Asian Historical Record]] | url = http://www.jacar.go.jp/DAS/meta/listPhoto?IS_STYLE=default&amp;ID=M2006092115064531921 | page = 36/42 | date = 1938-12-06 | accessdate = 2010-10-06 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110726042931/http://www.jacar.go.jp/DAS/meta/listPhoto?IS_STYLE=default&amp;ID=M2006092115064531921 | archivedate = 2011-07-26 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the council made a decision of prohibiting the expulsion of the [[Jews]] in Japan, [[Manchuria]], and China as Japanese national policy.&lt;ref name=mof/&gt;&lt;ref name=gosho/&gt;

Itagaki returned to China again as chief of staff of the [[China Expeditionary Army]] from 1939-1941. However, the defeat of Japanese forces against the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Red Army]] at [[Battle of Khalkhin Gol|Nomonhan]] in the summer of 1939 was a major blow to his career, and he was reassigned to command the [[Chosen Army]] in [[Korea]], then considered a backwater post.

As the war situation continued to deteriorate for Japan, the Chosen Army was elevated to the [[Japanese Seventeenth Area Army]] in 1945, with Itagaki still as [[commander in chief]]. He was then reassigned to the [[Japanese Seventh Area Army]] in [[Singapore]] and [[British Malaya|Malaya]] in April 1945. He surrendered Japanese forces in [[Southeast Asia]] to British Admiral [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Louis Mountbatten]] in Singapore on 12 September 1945.

After the war, he was taken into custody by the [[Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers|SCAP]] authorities and charged with [[war crimes]], specifically in connection with the Japanese seizure of Manchuria, his escalation of the war against the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] during his term as War Minister, and for allowing inhumane treatment of [[prisoners of war]] during his term as commander of Japanese forces in Southeast Asia. He was found guilty on counts 1, 27, 29, 31, 32, 35, 36 and 54 and was condemned to death in 1948 by the [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East]]. Itagaki was hanged on 23 December 1948 at [[Sugamo Prison]], Tokyo.&lt;ref&gt;Maga, ''Judgement at Tokyo''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Seri Bahlol''', also '''Sahri Bahlol''' ({{lang-ur|{{nq|سری بہلول}}}}), is located near  [[Takht-i-Bahi]], about 70 kilometer north-west of [[Peshawar]], [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]], [[Pakistan]].

==History==
[[File:Gandhara Sahr-i-Bhalol.jpg |thumb|left|Seri Bahlol is at the center of the [[Gandhara]] area.]]
Seri Bahlol is a historical place and it has been included in the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage List]] since 1980.&lt;ref name="Unesco"&gt;Unesco [http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/140/]&lt;/ref&gt; The ruins of Seri Bahlol are the remnants of a small ancient fortified town built during the [[Kushan]] period.&lt;ref name="Unesco"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Katariya|first1=Adesh|title=The Glorious History of Kushana Empire: Kushana Gurjar History|date=2012|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=P7TpDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PT47&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city was protected during the time of [[John Marshall (archaeologist)|John Marshall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Conserving Fortified Heritage: The Proceedings of the 1st International Conference on Fortifications and World Heritage|date=2016|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|isbn=9781443896375|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=8CFUDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA87&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It contains the remains of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], which have not been properly excavated. Antiques such as statues, coins, utensils and jewellery are commonly found.&lt;ref&gt;Hassan Dani, Dr: The Peshawar&lt;/ref&gt; The local people continue illegal excavation in their homes and land, damaging the historical monuments. Some of the local dealers of antiques misguide the local population and instigate them to involve in illegal excavation. It requires national and international attention in order to reserve the remnants at Seri Bahlol.&lt;ref name="Unesco"/&gt;

The word "Seri Bahlol" has been explained by various people in different ways. The local people, however, explains that this is a combination of two [[Hindi]] words "Sheri" means Sir and "Bahlol" the name of a prominent political and religious leader of the area. However, the name is not as old as the village Seri Bahlol. The village is located on a hillock protected by a well sophisticated stone wall which was constructed under the [[Kushans]].&lt;ref name="Unesco"/&gt; The wall is damaged in several places, but it is still visible in many places. The village is surrounded by fertile land where local people practice agriculture. For the last few years, the rapid population growth has engulfed the agriculture land which is a risk for food security.

The [[ancient Egypt]]ian '''Temple of Ezbet Rushdi''' was discovered near the modern village of Ezbet Rushdi el-Saghira – itself just north of [[Tell el-Dab'a]], the ancient [[Avaris]] – and dates to the [[Twelfth Dynasty]].&lt;ref name=rw&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilkinson|first=Richard H.|authorlink=Richard H. Wilkinson|title=The Complete Temples of Ancient Egypt|year=2000|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|location=New York|isbn=0-500-05100-3|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first excavated from 1951 by Shehata Adam who was working for the [[Egyptian Antiquities Service]].&lt;ref&gt;S. Adam: ''Report on the Excavations of the Department of Antiquities at Ezbet Rushdi'', in: ''ASAE'' 56 (1959), 207–226.&lt;/ref&gt; The temple was again excavated in 1996 by an Austrian mission under [[Manfred Bietak]].&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Czerny, [http://www.auaris.at/html/ezbet_en.html Ezbet Rushdi] www.auaris.at&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Egyptian temple|temple]] complex has a layout that is typical of the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] temples.&lt;ref name=rw/&gt; It measures 31 × 41.5 m and was built of [[mudbrick]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Czerny: ''Tell el-Dab'a XXII, "Der Mund der beiden Wege", Die Siedlung und der Tempelbezirk des Mittleren Reiches von Ezbet Ruschdi, Volume 1'' Vienna 2015, {{ISBN|9783700169949}}, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; According to the first excavator Shehata Adam, the temple was built by king [[Amenemhat I]]; a stela found here dates to king [[Senusret III]] and it seemed likely that the latter expanded the temple during his own reign.&lt;ref name=rw/&gt;

However, the Austrian excavations showed that under the temple stretched an older settlement, which could be dated by pottery to the first half of the 12th dynasty. The temple itself was given a new construction date at c. the mid-12th dynasty, probably at year 5 of Senwosret III, as indicated by the above-mentioned stela.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Czerny: ''Tell el-Dab´a XXII'', vol 1, pp. 82–85&lt;/ref&gt; The entrance was on the north side, where the walls were stronger and it seems that they formed a brick [[Pylon (architecture)|pylon]]. The entrance was at one time perhaps framed by inscribed limestone slabs.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Czerny: ''Tell el-Dab´a XXII'', vol 1, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; The proper temple stood within an open courtyard. On the west side behind the main gate there was small temple, while the main one was opposite the north entrance. Behind the entrance of the temple proper stood a courtyard with perhaps eight columns. Some stone column bases were still found. East and west of this courtyard were on either side two smaller chambers, while on the south side were three cult chapels. This temple was placed within a larger complex. On the east side were excavated remains of storage and administrative buildings.

In the temple several statues of high officials and of kings were found.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Czerny: ''Tell el-Dab'a XXII'', vol 1, pp. 427–440&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Book of the Highest Initiation''' (also known as “The Book of the Policy and the Highest Initiation” - Arabic: “Kitab as-Siyasa wa’l-Balagh al-Akhbar”) is a text that falsely claims to be of [[Isma'ilism|Ismaili]] origin and is wrongfully attributed to ‘Ubayd Allah, or [[Abdullah al-Mahdi Billah]], the first [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] Caliph-Imam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The New Encyclopedia of Islam|date=2013|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|edition=Fourth|page=202|last1=Glassé|first1=Cyril}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work is clearly a false account of Ismaili initiation and was written with the intent of denigrating [[Isma'ilism|Ismaili]] beliefs and practices.

== The author ==
The actual creator of this text is unknown, but evidence reveals that the author constructed this false account of Ismaili initiation rituals as part of a larger anti-[[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] propaganda campaign initiated by [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] supporters in the 10th century.

== The work ==
By the tenth century, the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] Caliphate posed a dangerous threat to [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] hegemony. In response to this threat, the Abbasid Caliph initiated a large-scale propaganda campaign to challenge the legitimacy of Fatimid Caliphs and to present [[Isma'ilism|Ismailism]] as an un-Islamic [[heresy]] that is a danger to [[Muslim]]s. For example, texts such as the [[Baghdad Manifesto]], which was written and signed by [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] scholars, claimed that the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] Caliph-Imams were not descendants of ‘[[Ali]]. But other texts, like '''The Book of the Highest Initiation''', were created to appear as genuine Ismaili works.

The full text of '''The Book of the Highest Initiation''' does not survive, but scholar S.M. Stern has reconstructed the text of the pamphlet using several sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Studies in Early Ismāʻīlism|publisher=Brill|location=Jerusalem|pages=56–83|last1=Stern|first1=S.M.|authorlink1=The ‘Book of the Highest Initiation’ and Other Anti-Ismaili Travesties}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The text claims to be a letter written by Fatimid Caliph-Imam [[Abdullah al-Mahdi Billah]] to his missionaries working to convert people to [[Isma'ilism|Ismailism]]. It is written as an instruction manual, organized into 35 short paragraphs.

The account begins with instruction about how to attract converts from a multitude of different backgrounds, including [[Christian]]s, [[Jews]], [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]], [[Manichaeism|Manichaeans]], philosophers, and [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] Muslims.

The pamphlet instructs that initiates must swear an oath before the missionaries begin to reveal more about their beliefs. It goes on to claim that there are 7 grades of initiation, each one moving closer and closer to total sacrilege. At the final stage, the initiate is “dispensed from the religious practices” altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Studies in Early Ismāʻīlism,|date=1983|publisher=Brill|location=Jerusalem|page=71|last1=Stern|first1=S.M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of this text was to present [[Isma'ilism|Ismailism]] as a system that leads to complete departure from religion. Its depicts the faith as not only foreign to Islam, but also insidiously dangerous to it.

The contents of this fabricated text do not reflect the beliefs or practices of Ismailis. It is true, however that the Fatimid [[Dawah|da’wah]] system was engaged in recruiting converts to their faith throughout the [[Dar al-islam|dar al-Islam]]. These [[Da'i|Da’is]] were successful in attracting converts from a wide range of background. The author of The Book of the Highest Initiation, clearly threatened by the success of these missions, intentionally demeans the Ismaili mission and accuses it of manipulating its adherents into disbelief and departure from religion.

== The legacy ==

This work has had a large influence on the historical depiction and understanding of [[Isma'ilism|Ismailism]]. The idea that there were ‘7 grades of initiation’ had a particularly long afterlife.

Because authentic Ismaili documents were available to a general readership until recently, slanderous and fabricated works such as this one were thought to be accurate depictions of Ismaili religion.

S.M. Stern relates that even in the beginning of the 20th century, some Western academics thought that this account revealed the “secret doctrine of the [[Isma'ilism|Isma’ilis]].”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Studies in Early Ismāʻīlism|date=1983|publisher=Brill|location=Jerusalem|page=58|last1=Stern|first1=S.M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the publication and circulation of authentically Ismaili texts, a wide non-Ismaili readership can now recognize the falsity of this text and appreciate the genuine teachings of the [[Isma'ilism|Isma’ili]] [[Dawah|da’wah]].

'''''The Institutes of Biblical Law''''' is a 1973 book by the philosopher and theologian [[Rousas Rushdoony|Rousas John Rushdoony]]. It is the first volume of a three-volume work, also referred to by the same title, which is modeled after [[John Calvin]]'s ''[[Institutes of the Christian Religion]]'' (1536). Together with Rushdoony's other writings, the book is the basis of [[Christian Reconstructionism]].

==Summary==
Rushdoony expounds the [[Ten Commandments]], adopting a [[Theonomy|theonomic]] perspective. He maintains that almost all of the Old Testament civil law is normative for civil governments.&lt;ref name="Frame"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frame|first=John|author-link=John Frame (theologian)|title=The Institutes of Biblical Law: A Review Article|journal=[[Westminster Theological Journal|WTJ]]|year=1976|volume=38|issue=2|pages=200–201|url=http://www.frame-poythress.org/frame_articles/1976Rushdoony.htm|accessdate=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rushdoony provides an outline of a program for establishing a Christian [[theocracy]].&lt;ref name=Chapman&gt;{{cite book |title=Culture Wars: An Encyclopedia of Issues, Viewpoints, and Voices, Volume 1 |last=Chapman |first=Roger |authorlink= |author2=Waskey, Andrew J.  |year=2009 |publisher=M.E.Sharpe  |location= |isbn=978-0765617613 |page=90 |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

The theologian [[John Frame (theologian)|John Frame]] gave ''The Institutes of Biblical Law'' a mixed review in ''[[Westminster Theological Journal]]'', writing that the book convinced him that "Rushdoony is one of the most important Christian social critics alive today", but also criticizing it on various grounds. Frame credited Rushdoony with cogently arguing against attempts to replace scripture with [[natural law]], with showing a broad and deep knowledge of scripture, and with "a remarkably detailed grasp of the historical background and present condition of human culture." However, he found the book "a bit rough-hewn", noting that it "began as a series of lectures" and in some respects still resembles one, and that it contained "considerable repetition". Overall, Frame concluded that the book had "great strengths and great weaknesses", noting that he had tried "to keep this review balanced between strong praise and strong criticism."&lt;ref name="Frame" /&gt;

The journalist [[M. Stanton Evans]], writing in the ''[[National Review]]'', described ''The Institutes of Biblical Law'' as "a work of prodigious scope and erudition" and a "thoughtful book".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Evans|first=M. Stanton|title=Dark Horses|journal=[[National Review]]|year=1978|volume=30|issue=1|page=45}}{{subscription needed|via=[https://www.ebsco.com EBSCO]'s Academic Search Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joe Bageant]] suggests that if the United States experiences a [[Fourth Great Awakening|fourth]] "[[Great Awakening]]", historians may one day "document it as beginning in 1973 with the publication of R. J. Rushdoony's seminal ''The Institutes of Biblical Law''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bageant|first=Joe|author-link=Joe Bageant|title=Deer Hunting with Jesus: Dispatches from America's Class War|year=2007|page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Montgomery of the ''[[Public Eye Magazine]]'' describes ''The Institutes of Biblical Law'' as Rushdoony's "magnum opus", and identifies it and Rushdoony's other writings as providing the basis for Christian Reconstructionism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Montgomery|first=Peter|title=Biblical Economics: The Divine Laissez-Faire Mandate|journal=[[Public Eye Magazine]]|year=2015|pages=11–15}}{{subscription needed|via=[https://www.ebsco.com EBSCO]'s Academic Search Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Unsibanbon''' (原始反本) is one of the main teachings of [[Jeung San Do]]. Wun(原) means "origin" or "primitive" and Shi(始) means "beginning" or "start". Ban(反) means "reverse" or "opposite" and Bon(本) means "origin" or "base". Its literal meaning is that returning to the origin.

== How Unsibanbon appears in our daily life? ==
Before understanding Unsibanbon further, it is recommended that you understand both [[Cosmic year (Chinese astrology)|Cosmic year]] and [[Gaebyeok]] because Unsibanbon can be explained in more detail in the context of Cosmic year.

The one constant in the universe is change, and at the time of the Autumn [[Gaebyeok]], the direction of that change is returning to the origin. In our lives we often have the desire to return to our origins whether it means returning home after a long journey, discovering our ethnic and cultural roots, seeking the original purpose of our lives, or returning to the origin of life through meditation. The practice of returning to the origin is discovering who we truly are. It can also entail solving a problem at its root. 

== Why Unsibanbon is important? ==
According to the eastern philosophy, everything is changing and it has its own cycle. It is not difficult to find a cycle. Even our planet earth has its own cycle. Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter. This cycle is divided with four different seasons, but the principle below is always [[Yin yang|yin and yang]]. 

When yang (positive energy) reaches its end, it must return to its origin. Just like a cannonball shot to the sky directly, it goes up to the sky and at a certain point, it returns to the ground. This action of return at the turning point is called Geukjeukban (克卽反). 

As it is explained above, earth's four seasons can be contained in [[Yin yang|yin and yang]]. Spring and summer represent yang (positive energy) and autumn and winter represents yin (negative energy). 

When summer reaches its end (end of positive energy), just like a cannonball reaches its turning point, it returns to its origin from its farther-reached-end.

This principle is important because Unsibanbon is happening regardless we acknowledge it or not. Also, it is important to accept and do our action with Unsibanbon this time of our life because it is natural like a shot cannonball returning to the ground from the sky. For this reason, many people meditate to be back to their origin.

Quote from [[Dojeon]]

:There is dao.
:within dao there is virtue.
:from virtue there is edification.
:from edification there is growth.
:with growth there are people.
:from people there are multitudes.
:there is one person the multitudes would want to uphold.
:they would uphold a sage king like Yao.
:Dojeon 4:87:2-9

A '''votive crown''' is a [[votive offering]] in the form of a [[crown (headgear)|crown]], normally in precious metals and often adorned with jewels.  Especially in the [[Early Middle Ages]], they are of a special form, designed to be suspended by chains at an altar, [[shrine]] or image.  Later examples are more often typical crowns in the style of the period, either designed to be placed on the head of a statue, or re-used in this way after donation.

==Pre-Christian examples==
There were pagan votive crowns in the ancient world, although these are essentially known only from literary references. [[Vitruvius]] records that when [[Hiero II of Syracuse]] (died 215 BC) suspected his goldsmith of cheating him over the making of a votive crown for a statue in a temple, for which he had supplied the gold to be used, he asked [[Archimedes]] to devise a test. This led Archimedes to his famous ''[[Eureka (word)|eureka]]'' moment, after he realized he could test the crown  by comparing its [[displacement (fluid)|displacement]] of water to that of the same weight of pure gold; in fact the goldsmith had taken some gold and added silver instead.&lt;ref&gt;Rossi &amp; Russo, 11-12. [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Vitruvius/9*.html Vitruvius text], see sections 9-12.&lt;/ref&gt; From other references, it seems that in classical times not just statues of the gods, but also living rulers were presented with crowns in the hope of a favourable response to a request.

==Suspended votive crowns==
The largest number of surviving examples of the Christian Early Medieval suspended type come from 7th century [[Visigoth]]ic [[Hispania]], especially the [[Treasure of Guarrazar]], from near [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], which includes no fewer than twenty-six examples in gold, probably hidden as the [[Muslim conquests|Muslim invasion]] drew near.  These were excavated in 1859, and are now divided between the [[National Archaeological Museum of Spain]] in Madrid and the [[Musée de Cluny]] in Paris.&lt;ref name=musee&gt;[[Musée de Cluny]], [http://www.musee-moyenage.fr/pages/page_id18361_u1l2.htm webpage with another crown] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317142133/http://www.musee-moyenage.fr/pages/page_id18361_u1l2.htm |date=2010-03-17 }}, accessed May 20, 2010 (in French).&lt;/ref&gt; However the type was originally Roman or Byzantine, and adopted widely across Europe;&lt;ref name=stokstad84&gt;Stokstad, 84&lt;/ref&gt;  nearly all these have been lost, as the objects were naturally extremely vulnerable to theft or looting. These could not be worn, as they were too small and also very often had [[pendilia]], or dangling ornaments on chains hanging from the main crown, often with jewels and perhaps formed into letters which spelled a word or phrase. In the example above, the letters on the pendilia spell "RECCESVINTHVS REX OFFERET", or "King [[Recceswinth]] offered this".&lt;ref name=stokstad84/&gt;  These royal donations signified the submission of the monarchy to God.&lt;ref name=musee/&gt;  Such objects were probably influenced by the thirty suspended gold crowns placed round the main altar of [[Hagia Sophia]] by [[Justinian]], now lost,&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad, 84; Beckwith, 345&lt;/ref&gt; although the Christian practice is at least as old as the 4th century.&lt;ref&gt;Chopin, Danielle Gaborit.[https://books.google.com/books?id=qtgotOF0MKQC&amp;pg=PA390&amp;dq=Votive+crown&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6zn0S528K4KC8gan7737DQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=Votive%20crown&amp;f=false ''Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages''] "Crown, art", edited by André Vauchez, Richard Barrie Dobson, Michael Lapidge, Volume 1, page 390.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main body of suspended crowns is usually flat around the top as well as the bottom rim; some are merely an open framework of flexibly linked metal pieces.  Such crowns were probably found widely across Christian Europe in this period; the will of 572 of Aredius, a wealthy friend of [[Gregory of Tours]] in [[Gaul]], describes a crown that sounds very similar in form to the Spanish examples.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, 62&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]] was perhaps originally made as a votive crown, although it was later used for the [[coronation]] of monarchs including [[Napoleon I]].  Another gold crown was a source of contention in [[Constantinople]]; it was given to the [[Maurice (emperor)|Emperor Maurice]] (r. 582-602) by his wife [[Constantina (empress)|Constantina]] and the [[dowager]] [[Sophia (empress)|Empress Sophia]] for Easter 601, intended to be worn by him.  Instead, he had it suspended by chains over the main altar of Hagia Sophia, upsetting the two ladies.&lt;ref&gt;Garland, Linda [http://www.roman-emperors.org/tina.htm Online biography of Constantina]&lt;/ref&gt;  It hung there for nearly two centuries, until [[Leo IV the Khazar|Emperor Leo IV]] coveted it and took it for his own use. In a suspiciously neat story, the crown was richly decorated with [[Carbuncle (gemstone)|carbuncles]] (jewels), and Leo, who was an [[Byzantine iconoclasm|iconoclast]], soon after died of an outbreak of [[carbuncle]]s (abscesses), allowing the church to draw the obvious conclusion; other stories said his wife had poisoned him.&lt;ref&gt;Treadgold, 370, though he says the crown was a different one, given by [[Heraclius]]&lt;/ref&gt; Another Byzantine votive crown, given by [[Leo VI the Wise|Leo VI]] (r. 886-912) is now in the Treasury of [[San Marco, Venice]], and is decorated with [[cloisonné enamel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i154.photobucket.com/albums/s279/desniza/VI.jpg|title=Image of Leo VI's crown|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statue votive crowns==
[[File:Maria de las angustias 1.JPG|thumb|300px|One of many crowned statues of the [[Virgin Mary]] carried in the processions of [[Holy Week in Seville]].]] 
In England, a later medieval source says that [[King Canute]] gave a, or "his", crown to be placed on or over ("super caput") the head of the [[rood]], or large [[crucifix]], in [[Winchester Cathedral]] (other notables decorated statues with their jewellery or a sword).&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 212,&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' records that [[Hereward the Wake]]'s men looted a solid gold crown from the head of the rood on the main altar of [[Peterborough Cathedral]] in 1070.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 213,&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Romanesque art|Romanesque period]] saw the height of  crowned images of Christ, who is often shown wearing a crown on the cross in wood and metal figures, and manuscript illuminations, and also the introduction of crowned images of the [[Virgin Mary]] in the West, as the concept of Mary as [[Queen of Heaven]] became increasingly prominent.

A very small late medieval crown now in the Treasury of [[Aachen Cathedral]] was made for the famously lavish wedding celebrations in 1468 of [[Margaret of York]], [[Duchess of Burgundy]], sister of [[Edward IV of England]], and later placed on a statue of the Virgin Mary as a votive offering. It was designed to be worn on top of an elaborate headress and hairstyle, or perhaps on a [[hennin]], and is much smaller than a conventional crown for wearing directly on the head.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture24.org.uk/asset_arena/7/88/22887/v0_master.jpg Image of Margaret's crown] Schitker, 105-111 explores the donation in detail.&lt;/ref&gt; This is now a rare example of a medieval votive crown that has survived above ground. A few years later, in 1487, the crown that had been used by the pretender [[Lambert Simnel]] was given to a statue of the Virgin in Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;Schnitker, 110&lt;/ref&gt;

Crowns designed solely for statues became increasingly elaborate, especially in the [[Baroque]] period, and in the Spanish world; they often have a flat radiating "[[sunburst]]" around them, in the style used for [[monstrance]]s, as in the example illustrated. Statues of the Virgin Mary and the [[Infant Jesus]], of the [[Infant Jesus of Prague]] type, are among those most commonly crowned.  The [[Crown of the Andes]] is a votive crown from [[Colombia]] in gold with 450 [[emerald]]s, apparently made between the late 16th and 18th centuries, perhaps originally as an offering in thanks for the city of [[Popayán]] being spared from a plague.  It is now in private hands in the US.&lt;ref&gt;Norman, Geraldine, [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/crowning-glory-of-the-andes-1587131.html ‘Crowning Glory of the Andes’]: ''The Independent on Sunday'', 18 June 1995. The crown was not in fact sold.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary examples==
Votive crowns have continued to be produced in Catholic countries in modern times.  Often such crowns were kept in the [[church treasury]] except for special occasions such as relevant feast-days, when they are worn by the statue.  Christ and the Virgin Mary are frequently conventionally shown wearing crowns in Christian art, in subjects such as the [[Coronation of the Virgin]], and are the most common figures to be crowned, but  other saints may also be given crowns, especially if the saint was royal, or a [[martyr]], as martyrs are promised crowns in heaven by many texts.

In Greece a [[Tama (votive)|''tama'']] or votive offering of, or depicting, two small wedding crowns, as used locally, indicates a request for a good marriage.  Actual crowns used in ceremonies were normally retained by the couple.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=o8JlWxBYs40C&amp;pg=PA90&amp;dq=Greek+wedding+crown&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=Greek%20wedding%20crown&amp;f=false Marriage Customs of the World].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wagner Maniçoba de Moura''' ({{IPA-pt|ˈvaɡneɾ ˈmowɾa}}; born 27 June 1976)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Biography of Wagner Moura |website=Gente Babado| url = http://gente.ig.com.br/wagnermoura/p1237852135801.html | publisher = IG | language = Portuguese | accessdate = 2011-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Brazil]]ian film, television, and stage [[actor]]. Besides being a well-established and acclaimed actor in Brazil, he has achieved widespread international fame for his portrayal of Captain (later Colonel) Roberto Nascimento, protagonist of the highly successful film ''[[Elite Squad]]'' (2007) and its sequel, ''[[Elite Squad: The Enemy Within]]'' (2010). He also gained recognition globally playing Spider in the [[sci-fi film]] ''[[Elysium (film)|Elysium]]'' (2013) and the lead role of [[Pablo Escobar]] in the [[Netflix]] series ''[[Narcos]]'' from 2015 to 2016, for which he received a [[Golden Globe]] nomination.

==Early life and education==
Moura was born in [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], a city located in [[Nordeste|Northeast Region]] of Brazil, but grew up in the small town of [[Rodelas]], [[Bahia]]. His mother, Alderiva, was a housewife, and his father, José Moura, was a sergeant in the [[Brazilian Air Force]]. At the age of 13, he moved back with his family to [[Salvador, Bahia]].

He graduated in [[journalism]] at [[Federal University of Bahia]] but decided to become an actor.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|609944|section=bio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1997 he appeared in the film ''[[Woman on Top]]'' starring [[Penélope Cruz]].

In 2007 he played Captain Nascimento, protagonist of the [[Golden Bear (award)|Golden Bear]] winner in the 2008 [[Berlin Film Festival]], ''[[Elite Squad]]''.

During the preparation for the first ''Elite Squad'' film, Wagner and part of the cast were subject to realistic special forces training conducted by Paulo Storani, a former captain of [[Batalhão de Operações Policiais Especiais|BOPE]], the elite squad portrayed in the movie.&lt;ref&gt;http://veja.abril.com.br/211107/p_124.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;
During training, Storani was asked by the cast director to help "develop" Wagner's aggression for the role, which he attempted to do through repeated sessions of moral abuse.&lt;ref&gt;http://veja.abril.com.br/211107/p_124.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; After several days, Storani finally got the reaction he was looking for and a little more. He reportedly made a fictional threat to Wagner's family, particularly mentioning Wagner's newborn to which the actor responded with a punch that fractured Storani's nose. "That's when Captain Nascimento was born", said Storani.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.estadao.com.br/noticias/impresso,ex-capitao-teve-nariz-quebrado-por-ator,55880,0.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, he starred in the sequel to ''Elite Squad'', ''[[Elite Squad: The Enemy Within]]''. 

In 2013, he played "Spider" in the [[sci-fi film]] ''[[Elysium (film)|Elysium]]''. He starred in the [[Netflix]] [[List of original programs distributed by Netflix|original series]] ''[[Narcos]]'' as the famous drug lord [[Pablo Escobar]]. Already fluent in Portuguese and English, he learned Spanish to play the part of Escobar. Moura later reprised the role for a cameo appearance in the ''Narcos'' companion series, ''[[Narcos: Mexico]]''.

As of 2017, it is reported that Wagner is beginning his debut as director of the film ''Marighella'' based on novel ''Marighella: The Guerrilla That Burned Down the World'' about the Bahian marxist guerrilla [[Carlos Marighella]] written by journalist Mário Magalhães.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.o2filmes.com/noticias/en/10591/wagner-moura-no-conversa-com-bial/&lt;/ref&gt;

From left to right: [[Marcelo Bonfá]], Moura and [[Dado Villa-Lobos]]. To their right and partially cut out of the picture is touring bassist Rodrigo Favaro]]

Besides his acting career, Moura is a [[lyricist]] and the [[vocalist]] of a [[Musical ensemble|band]] named ''Sua Mãe'' ("Your Mum").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Article about Wagner Moura in ''Hamlet'' and as vocalist of ''Sua Mãe'' (in Portuguese) | url = http://odia.terra.com.br/portal/diversaoetv/html/2009/3/wagner_moura_brega_e_chique_1575.html | publisher = [[O Dia]] | date = 2009-03-21 | accessdate = 2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, he guest performed as lead vocalist for some [[Legião Urbana]] tribute shows, featuring surviving members [[Marcelo Bonfá]] and [[Dado Villa-Lobos]].

==Personal life==
Since 2001, Moura has been married to journalist and photographer Sandra Delgado, with whom he has three sons: Bem, Salvador, and José. He practices [[Transcendental Meditation technique|Transcendental Meditation]]. Moura's native language is Portuguese, but he also fluently speaks both English and Spanish. For his portrayal of Pablo Escobar in ''Narcos'', Moura went back to college to take Spanish for foreigners, to perfect his pronunciation as someone who speaks Spanish as a first language. Moura had to gain over 40 pounds to play the role of Pablo Escobar; after production of the second season of Narcos, Moura decided to lose the weight with an all vegan diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=De Campos Mello|first1=Raphaela|title=Meditação transcendental: a técnica de David Lynch e Wagner Moura|url=http://casa.abril.com.br/materia/meditacao-transcendental-a-tecnica-de-david-lynch-e-wagner-moura|website=Casa.com|accessdate=28 September 2014|date=July 9, 2012|quote=Assim como Lynch, praticante há 40 anos, diversos artistas aderiram ao treinamento mental, entre eles Oprah Winfrey, Clint Eastwood, Paul McCartney e o brasileiro Wagner Moura.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
