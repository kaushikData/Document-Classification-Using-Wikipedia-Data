The '''1938 Polish ultimatum to Lithuania''' was an [[ultimatum]] delivered to [[Lithuania]] by [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] on March 17, [[1938 in Poland|1938]]. The Lithuanian government had steadfastly refused to have any [[diplomatic relations]] with Poland after 1920, protesting the annexation of the [[Vilnius Region]] by Poland.&lt;ref name=cd118&gt;{{cite book | last=Skirius | first=Juozas | title=Gimtoji istorija.

Five days earlier, Poland, feeling supported by international recognition of the [[Anschluss|annexation of Austria]] by [[Nazi Germany]], decided to deliver an ultimatum to Lithuania.&lt;ref name=cd118/&gt; The ultimatum demanded that the Lithuanian government unconditionally agree to establish [[diplomatic relations]] with [[Warsaw]] within 48 hours, and that the terms be finalized before March 31. The establishment of diplomatic relations would mean a ''de facto'' renunciation of Lithuanian claims to the region containing its historic capital, [[Vilnius]] (known in Polish as Wilno).

Lithuania, preferring peace to war, accepted the ultimatum on March 19. Although diplomatic relations were established as a result of the ultimatum, Lithuania did not agree to recognize the loss of Vilnius ''[[de jure]]''.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; The government of Poland [[Polish-Czechoslovak border conflicts|made a similar move]] against the [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] government in [[Prague]] on September 30, 1938, when it took advantage of the [[Sudeten Crisis]] to demand a portion of [[Zaolzie]]. On both occasions, Poland used the international crises to address long-standing border disputes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Norman |last=Davies |title= God's Playground: A History of Poland |year=2005 |publisher=Columbia University Press | pages=319 | url= https://books.google.com/?id=EBpghdZeIwAC&amp;pg=PA319 | isbn=978-0-231-12819-3| accessdate= June 16, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vilnius dispute ==
{{main article|Vilnius Region}}
Lithuania severed its diplomatic ties with Poland after the Polish general [[Lucjan Żeligowski]] [[Żeligowski's Mutiny|staged a mutiny]] in October 1920 by order of [[Józef Piłsudski]].&lt;ref name=msn&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encarta.msn.com/sidebar_461500494/1938_lithuania.html |title=1938: Lithuania |publisher=MSN Encarta |work=Collier's Year Book |accessdate=2008-03-14 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kvWEPG6Z?url=http://encarta.msn.com/sidebar_461500494/1938_lithuania.html |archivedate=October 31, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; He invaded Lithuanian-held territory, captured the disputed city of [[Vilnius]] (known to Poles as Wilno), and established the short-lived [[Republic of Central Lithuania]]. This entity was incorporated into Poland in 1922.

The League attempted to mediate the dispute and [[Paul Hymans]] presented concrete proposals to form a federation. However, both sides were unwilling to make compromises and negotiations collapsed in January 1922.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/?id=fecMC0LXU-sC&amp;pg=PA31

It was one of the main factors that led to the decision of the [[Conference of Ambassadors]] to award Vilnius to Poland in March 1923.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Eric Senn. ''The Great Powers Lithuania and the Vilna Question, 1920-1928''. E.J. Brill. 1966. pp. 107-113.&lt;/ref&gt;

The result was a state of "no war, no peace" as Lithuania avoided recognizing any Polish claims to the city and the region,&lt;ref name="MacQueen_context"/&gt; as well as refusing to undertake any actions that would recognize Poland's control of Vilnius even ''de facto''.&lt;ref name=msn/&gt; Lithuania broke off all diplomatic relations with Poland and continuously emphasized that Vilnius remained its permanent capital ([[Kaunas]] was designated as the [[Temporary capital of Lithuania|temporary capital]]). Poland refused to formally recognize the existence of any dispute regarding the region, since that would have lent legitimacy to the Lithuanian claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Eidintas | first=Alfonsas |author2=Vytautas Žalys|author3=Alfred Erich Senn | editor=Ed.

For example, a letter from Poland to Lithuania needed to be sent to a neutral country, repackaged in a new envelope to remove any Polish signs, and only then delivered to Lithuania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=The New York Times |first=Emil |last=Lengyel |date=1939-03-20 |title=Poland and Lithuania in a Long Feud |pages=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conflict over Vilnius remained the most important foreign policy issue in Lithuania, but it became increasingly marginalized in the international arena. There were unsuccessful informal attempts to normalize the situation, most notably by the Lithuanian Prime Minister [[Augustinas Voldemaras]] between 1927 and 1928 and by Foreign Minister [[Stasys Lozoraitis]] between 1934 and 1936, who asked President [[Antanas Smetona|Smetona]] to re-establish the diplomatic relations with Poland. Both sides engaged in emotional and nationalistic rhetoric.&lt;ref name=eidintas2&gt;{{cite book | last=Eidintas | first=Alfonsas |author2=Vytautas Žalys|author3=Alfred Erich Senn | editor=Ed.

== Rationale ==
On March 11,{{#tag:ref|Sometimes incorrectly cited as March 7.|group=note}} a day before Austria was annexed into [[German question#Later influence|Greater Germany]] following the [[Anschluss]], Justas Lukoševičius, a Lithuanian border patrol, shot Stanisław Serafin, a Polish soldier, on the demarcation line in the village of [[Trasninkas]] near [[Merkinė]]. The exact circumstances are not clear as the obscure event was variously portrayed as a Lithuanian provocation, a Polish provocation, or as an unfortunate accident.&lt;ref name=vitas&gt;{{cite journal| title= The Polish–Lithuanian Crisis of 1938: Events Surrounding the Ultimatum |url=http://www.lituanus.org/1984_2/84_2_03.htm | first=Robert |last=Vitas |journal=Lituanus |volume=20 |issue=2 |date=Summer 1984 |accessdate=2008-03-02| issn= 0024-5089| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080323160232/http://www.lituanus.org/1984_2/84_2_03.htm| archivedate= March 23, 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1920s and 1930s, similar incidents had occurred: between 1927 and 1937 seven Lithuanian border guards were killed during the course of 78 events.&lt;ref name=eidintas&gt;{{cite book | last=Eidintas | first=Alfonsas |author2=Vytautas Žalys|author3=Alfred Erich Senn | editor=Ed. Edvardas Tuskenis | title=Lithuania in European Politics: The Years of the First Republic, 1918–1940 | edition=Paperback |date=September 1999 | publisher=St. Martin's Press | location=New York | isbn=0-312-22458-3 | pages=154–158}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, such incidents were handled at the local level in an attempt to forestall escalation. On this occasion, however, Polish radio and newspapers picked up the story and fanned anti-Lithuanian sentiment. Protests were held in [[Warsaw]], [[Vilnius]], and four other cities where the crowds shouted for military action against Lithuania. There is evidence that the [[Camp of National Unity]] was involved in organizing the protests.&lt;ref name=vitas/&gt;

On March 13, the Polish government issued a threatening statement accusing Lithuania of provocation. On the following day, the [[Senate of the Republic of Poland]] called for the establishment of diplomatic relations and for the Lithuanian renunciation of claims to Vilnius.&lt;ref name=vitas/&gt; Upon receiving news that Poland was considering extreme measures, President Smetona was verging towards agreeing to discuss diplomatic relations, but changed his mind at almost the last minute.&lt;ref name=eidintas/&gt; On the night of March 14, the Lithuanians, acting through France's envoy to Warsaw, proposed a commission to investigate the shooting incident and to agree on measures to avoid such incidents in the future.&lt;ref name=vitas/&gt; This was a partial measure that clearly did not satisfy Poland,&lt;ref name=eidintas/&gt; which responded by refusing, in the first paragraph of the ultimatum delivered three days later,&lt;ref name=docs/&gt; to establish such a commission. At the same time Lithuanian diplomats approached foreign powers in a bid for international support.

== Initial version ==
The first version of the ultimatum, as drafted by [[Edward Rydz-Śmigły]], Prime Minister [[Felicjan Sławoj Składkowski]], and [[Jan Szembek (diplomat)|Jan Szembek]],&lt;ref name=vilnis/&gt; contained six demands:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=The New York Times | title=Poland Sends An Ultimatum |first=Jerzy |last=Shapiro |date=1938-03-18 |pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Establish normal diplomatic and consular relations with Poland
# Allow normal railway and road traffic and direct telephone and telegraph lines across the demarcation line
# Amend the Lithuanian constitution to acknowledge that Vilnius was no longer the capital of Lithuania
# Conclude the convention protecting the rights of the Polish minority in Lithuania in full
# Conclude a trade and tariff agreement
# Fully investigate the incident in Trasninkas

The Polish Foreign Minister [[Józef Beck]], who had just returned from a trip to [[Sorrento]], called for a government meeting on the night of March 16. During the meeting he argued that the ultimatum needed to contain only one demand: the establishment of diplomatic relations. In his view, such an ultimatum would not have violated any genuine Lithuanian interests and would offer much-improved prospects for peaceful resolution of the conflict and a speedy relief of tension.&lt;ref name=vitas/&gt; It was in accordance with Beck's vision for Eastern Europe, which was based on a Warsaw-dominated Polish–Baltic–Scandinavian bloc free of Soviet or German influence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=The New York Times |title=Lithuania Surrenders | date=1938-03-21 |pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; a modified version of [[Józef Piłsudski]]'s [[Międzymorze]], which required the normalization of relations with Lithuania.&lt;ref name=vitas/&gt; The removal of the other demands also reflected political pressure on Poland from the Soviet Union, France, and the United Kingdom to prevent the conflict from escalating into warfare.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite journal| journal=The New York Times | first=Clarence K. |last=Streit |title=Pressure on Poles Weakens Demands |date=1939-03-19 |pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Polish government agreed to Beck's proposal, and the ultimatum was toned down. However, at the same time, Beck ordered military preparations. Poland assembled four divisions along the demarcation line; about 50,000 Polish troops were present, and just over 20,000 Lithuanian troops.&lt;ref name=times&gt;{{cite journal| title=Baltic Peace |journal=Time |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,759356,00.html | date=1938-03-28 |accessdate=2008-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Polish troops were reinforced by armored vehicles, by two air force regiments, consisting of about one hundred aircraft, and by the Polish fleet in the waters of the [[Baltic Sea]] along the Lithuanian shore.&lt;ref name=vitas/&gt;

== The ultimatum ==
The final text of the ultimatum, completed by Józef Beck and delivered through a Polish envoy in [[Tallinn]] to Bronius Dailidė, the Lithuanian envoy in Tallinn, was as follows:&lt;ref name=docs&gt;{{cite journal| title= Documents: The Polish Ultimatum to Lithuania – The Despatch of Lithuanian Minister J. Baltrušaitis in Moscow |url=http://www.lituanus.org/1985/85_4_02.htm | first=Robert |last=Vitas |journal=Lituanus |volume=31 |issue=4 |date=Winter 1985 |accessdate=2008-03-02| issn= 0024-5089}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: 1. "The proposition of the Lithuanian Government of 14 March cannot be accepted for it does not give sufficient guarantees concerning the security of the frontier in view of the negative results of all Polish–Lithuanian negotiations made up to the present time."

: 2. "For this reason the Polish Government declares that it considers as the only solution corresponding to the gravity of the situation the immediate establishment of normal diplomatic relations without any previous condition. This is the only way to regulate the neighborly questions for a Government animated by good faith to avoid events dangerous to peace."

: 3. "The Polish Government allows the Lithuanian Government 48 hours from the moment the note is presented for the acceptance of this proposition in making it known that diplomatic representations at Kaunas and Warsaw will be accredited not later than March 31, of this year. Until that date all discussions of a technical or other character between the Polish and Lithuanian Governments shall be continued by the envoys extraordinary and ministers [[plenipotentiary]] at Tallinn.
: The exchange of notes attached concerning the establishment of diplomatic relations shall take place, before the expiration of the period of 48 hours mentioned, at Tallinn between the Polish and Lithuanian Ministers at Tallinn."

: 4. "The proposition above mentioned will not be the subject of discussion with regard to its content or form—it is an unchangeable proposition.
: The failure to respond or the presentation of any supplements or reservations shall be considered by the Polish Government as a refusal. In the event of a negative reply the Polish Government will guarantee the just interest of the state by its proper means."

The ultimatum contained an attachment: a draft of what would be deemed an acceptable response to the ultimatum. The proposed response stated only that Lithuania agreed to establish regular diplomatic relations, send a [[legation]] to Warsaw, and guarantee normal conditions of operation for a Polish legation in Kaunas.&lt;ref name=docs/&gt;

== International reaction ==
After the [[Soviet–Lithuanian Peace Treaty]] was ratified in 1920, the [[Russian SFSR]] recognized Lithuanian claims to the Vilnius Region and continued to support them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Eidintas | first=Alfonsas |author2=Vytautas Žalys|author3=Alfred Erich Senn | editor=Ed. Edvardas Tuskenis | title=Lithuania in European Politics: The Years of the First Republic, 1918–1940 | edition=Paperback |date=September 1999 | publisher=St. Martin's Press | location=New York | isbn=0-312-22458-3 | pages=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its responses to the 1938 ultimatum, the [[Soviet Union]] expressed concerns over Lithuania's independence and threatened to abrogate the [[Soviet–Polish Non-Aggression Pact]] of 1932. It made it clear, though, that it did not wish to be drawn into an armed conflict.&lt;ref name=eidintas/&gt; This stance has been attributed to the growth of a threat from Japan;&lt;ref name=vitas/&gt; armed assistance to Lithuania would have required the [[Red Army]] to invade either Poland or Latvia&lt;ref name=times/&gt; and could have resulted in a war on two fronts.&lt;ref name=vitas/&gt; The Soviets urged France, a major ally of Poland at the time, to de-escalate the conflict and encourage a more moderate version of the ultimatum.&lt;ref name=vilnis/&gt; France and the United Kingdom, preoccupied with the Anschluss, pressured Lithuania to normalize the relationship with Poland as soon as possible. They feared that the ultimatum had been approved by Nazi Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal=The New York Times |date=1938-03-16 |first=Clarence K. |last=Streit |title=Reich-Polish Deal Feared in Geneva |pages=11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Germany, led by [[Adolf Hitler]], now turned its attention to the [[Klaipėda Region]], then held by Lithuania. In April 1938, Hitler stated that control of the [[Port of Klaipėda]] (German: ''Memel'') and its surrounding area was Germany's second-most important issue, following the status of the [[Germans in Czechoslovakia (1918–1938)|Sudeten area]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Baltic and the Outbreak of the Second World War | first=John |last= Hiden |author2=Thomas Lane |page=53 |publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=1992| url= https://books.google.com/?id=HzrpExvg2XgC&amp;pg=PA53 | isbn= 0-521-53120-9 | accessdate= June 16, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the event of armed hostilities between Poland and Lithuania, German troops were to defend and occupy the Klaipėda region and significant portions of western Lithuania.&lt;ref name=eidintas/&gt; The Polish ambassador to Nazi Germany, [[Józef Lipski]], was informed of these plans. The Poles agreed to cooperate with German troops and to respect German interests in Klaipėda if such an armed conflict were to arise.&lt;ref name=vilnis&gt;{{cite book | first=Vilnis |last=Sipols |title=Diplomatic Battles Before World War II |url=http://leninist.biz/en/1982/DBBW313/3.1.4-Polish.Ultimatum.to.Lithuania |chapter=Polish Ultimatum to Lithuania |location=Moscow |publisher=Progress Publishers |year=1982 | accessdate= March 15, 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in Hitler's assessment, an immediate bid for Klaipėda was impolitic; he wished to maintain the ''status quo'' until more time had passed after the [[Anschluss]]. The German suggestion was that Lithuania concede to the Polish demands.&lt;ref name=eidintas/&gt;

Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, the three [[Baltic states]], had formed the [[Baltic Entente]] in 1934. Its principal purposes were coordination of joint foreign policy and mutual international diplomatic support; it was not a military alliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Anatol |last=Lieven |title=The Baltic Revolution: Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and the Path to Independence |publisher=Yale University Press |year=1994 |pages=77 | isbn=0-300-06078-5 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=iz3NACNOpCAC&amp;pg=PA77
| accessdate= June 16, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Latvian and Estonian opinion, the Polish–Lithuanian dispute over Vilnius was outside the scope of the Entente, but they wished for a resolution, considering the conflict detrimental to the stability of the region.&lt;ref name=vitas/&gt; Latvia attempted to persuade Estonia to exert mutual pressure on Lithuania for a speedy acceptance of the ultimatum. This reaction from an ally was unexpected.&lt;ref name=eidintas/&gt;

== Acceptance ==
President Smetona held a government meeting late on the night of March 18, to decide whether to accept the ultimatum.&lt;ref name=ist/&gt; Lithuania clearly lacked international support and the demand was rather tame.

President Smetona received memoranda from nine nationalistic organizations urging the government to reject the ultimatum.&lt;ref name=cd118/&gt; However, a decisive comment was made by General [[Stasys Raštikis]], the commander of the Lithuanian army: He testified that a military victory over Poland was impossible and argued for a peaceful resolution.&lt;ref name=eidintas/&gt; The government's decision was confirmed by the [[Fourth Seimas]] with minimal discussion.&lt;ref name=ist/&gt; On March 19, Dailidė relayed acceptance of the ultimatum to the Poles, who gave a 12-hour extension to decide on the ultimatum as a show of good faith.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

== Aftermath ==
The ultimatum contributed to the general atmosphere of tension and fear in Europe. It relieved some of the pressure on Germany that had arisen in the aftermath of the Anschluss and tested the Soviets' willingness to defend their interests in Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name=nytaf&gt;{{cite journal |journal=The New York Times |title= Nazis are Pleased with Polish "Peace" |date=1939-03-20 |pages=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fears were expressed, both in Lithuania and abroad, that the establishment of diplomatic relations was not the only goal of Warsaw and that more far-reaching ultimata might follow.&lt;ref name=cd118/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=The New York Times |date=1939-03-20 |first=Clarence K. |last=Streit |title=Geneva's Anxiety on Poles Persists |pages=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speculations arose that Poland might seek to resurrect the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], using Germany's annexation of Austria as a precedent.&lt;ref name=nytaf/&gt; Poland announced that it planned to create a neutral bloc comprising Poland, Lithuania, [[Latvia]], Estonia, and [[Romania]] to counter both fascism and communism. It stated that it had no wish to incorporate Lithuanian territories and maintained that the bloc would be formed on the basis of bilateral non-aggression and economic treaties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The New York Times |title=Envoy Says Poland Plans Neutral Bloc |date=1939-03-22 |pages=1, 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', the impact of the ultimatum was felt on [[Wall Street]]; on March 17, the foreign currency and bond markets sagged, in some cases reaching the lowest points seen in several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=The New York Times |date=1939-03-18 |title=Wall St. Reflects Turmoil in Europe |pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; These markets recovered on March 19, after the ultimatum was accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal=The New York Times | title=Bond Prices Rise on a Broad Front |date=1939-03-20 |pages=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The acceptance triggered a government crisis in Lithuania: on March 24, Prime Minister [[Juozas Tūbelis]], who held uncompromising positions over Vilnius and at the time of the ultimatum was undergoing medical treatment in Switzerland, stepped down.&lt;ref name=ist&gt;{{cite book |title=Lietuvos istorija 11–12 klasėms | first=Rūstis |last=Kamuntavičius |author2=Vaida Kamuntavičienė|author3=Remigijus Civinskas|author4=Kastytis Antanaitis |year=2001 |publisher=Vaga |location=Vilnius |isbn=5-415-01502-7 |pages=302–303|language=lt}}&lt;/ref&gt; His successor, [[Vladas Mironas]], who was in favor of normalizing relations with Poland, assembled a new cabinet of ministers. Despite increasing pressure to form a broader coalition, the new cabinet was composed solely of members of the [[Lithuanian Nationalists Union]]. The unconditional acceptance hurt Lithuanian pride and damaged the reputation of the party.&lt;ref name=cd118/&gt; The suppressed opposition used this damage as an opportunity to renew its activities and formed a group called ''Ašis'' (Axis).&lt;ref name=cd118/&gt; In Poland the acceptance was greeted with enthusiasm, described as a "great bloodless victory",&lt;ref name=nytpl&gt;{{cite journal |journal=The New York Times |first=Jerzy |last=Shapiro |title=Warsaw, Pleased with Results, Now Would Form a Baltic Entente |date=1939-03-20 |pages= 1, 33}}&lt;/ref&gt; and celebrated by a military march in Vilnius.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=The New York Times |first=Jerzy |last=Shapiro |title=Poland Calls Back Army on Frontier; Talks Will Begin |date=1939-03-21 |pages=1, 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few days after the ultimatum, both Lithuania and Poland named their ambassadors. [[Kazys Škirpa]] was sent to Warsaw, and [[Franciszek Charwat]] was sent to Kaunas before March 31, the deadline indicated in the ultimatum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=New York Times |date=1939-04-01 |title=Poland Welcomes Envoy |pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Negotiations over practical matters began on March 25, in [[Augustów]], and by June three agreements covering rail transit, mail service, and river navigation had been concluded.&lt;ref name=vitas/&gt; The railroad, torn apart for several kilometers at the border, was repaired. A customs post was established in [[Vievis]], and consulates were opened in [[Klaipėda]] and Vilnius. Lithuania closed the League for the Liberation of Vilnius and the Vilnius Foundation; the latter organization had given financial support to Lithuanian activities in the Vilnius Region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Eidintas | first=Alfonsas |author2=Vytautas Žalys|author3=Alfred Erich Senn | editor=Ed. Edvardas Tuskenis | title=Lithuania in European Politics: The Years of the First Republic, 1918–1940 | edition=Paperback |date=September 1999 | publisher=St. Martin's Press | location=New York | isbn=0-312-22458-3 | pages=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Lithuania continued to claim Vilnius as its ''de jure'' capital. In May 1938 [[Lithuanian Constitution of 1938|a new constitution]] was adopted, which echoed the previous constitution's statement that Vilnius was the permanent capital of Lithuania and that Kaunas was merely a [[Temporary capital of Lithuania|temporary capital]].&lt;ref name=cd118/&gt; Poland continued to suppress Lithuanian organizations in Vilnius.&lt;ref name=cd118/&gt;&lt;ref name=vitas/&gt;

A thaw in Polish–Lithuanian relations began in spring 1939. After the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|German–Czech]] and [[1939 German ultimatum to Lithuania|German–Lithuanian crises]], Poland made more active efforts to ensure Lithuania's assistance, or at least neutrality, in the event of a war with Nazi Germany.&lt;ref name=cd118/&gt; Lithuanian General Stasys Raštikis and Polish Foreign Minister Józef Beck made high-profile visits to each other's countries,&lt;ref name=vitas/&gt; and Poland improved the conditions of Lithuanians in the Vilnius Region.&lt;ref name=cd118/&gt; However, Lithuania did not believe that Poland and its western allies were strong enough to resist Germany and the Soviet Union. When [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|Germany invaded Poland]] in September 1939, Lithuania maintained a policy of strict neutrality, refusing repeated German offers for a joint attack on Poland to capture Vilnius.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Eidintas | first=Alfonsas |author2=Vytautas Žalys|author3=Alfred Erich Senn | editor=Ed.

In June 1940, the Soviet Union [[military occupation|occupied]] and [[annexation|annexed]] Lithuania in accordance with the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]].&lt;ref&gt;I. Žiemele.

'''AV Festival''' is an international Festival of contemporary art, film and music, based in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]]. A biennial event, the Festival is thematically curated across contemporary artistic practice and wider society.

==History==

=== AV Festival 2014: Extraction ===
AV Festival 2014: Extraction ran from 1 – 31 March 2014. The curated programme featured 11 exhibitions, 36 film screenings, 10 concerts and 11 new commissions.

Highlights of the Festival included newly commissioned art works, sound walk and performances by [[Akio Suzuki]], new commissions by Susan Stenger and Lara Almarcegui, with weekend focuses on Digging for Sound and Post-Colonial Cinema. The closing weekend saw the music group [[Test Dept]] return with their debut event since the group disbanded in 1997. This large-scale outdoor event took place at the dramatic [[Dunston Staiths]]. Viewed from boats on the [[River Tyne]] over three nights, the event marked the 30th anniversary of the [[UK miners' strike (1984–85)|Miners’ Strike]].

=== AV Festival 2012: As Slow As Possible ===
AV Festival 2012: As Slow As Possible ran from 1–31 March 2012, and had the curatorial theme of slowness. Titled after ''[[As Slow as Possible|ASLSP (As SLow aS Possible)]]'', by artist [[John Cage]], the AV Festival 2012 theme explored how artists have stretched, measured and marked the passage of time. Some works lasted the full 31 days of the Festival.

For the first time, the Festival ran for a whole month. It took place at different speeds, paces and times of day, across Newcastle, [[Gateshead]], [[Middlesbrough]] and [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]], including 22 exhibitions, 38 film screenings, 15 concerts, six walks, a 744-hour continuous online radio, plus 16 new commissions and 18 UK premieres.

AV Festival 2012 achieved 94,096 visits, a 33% increase on 2010. It attracted 24% of visitors from outside the region, contributed £516k GVA to the local economy, and achieved a return on investment of £2.88 for every £1 of public funding received. 92% of the audience rated the quality of the Festival as good or outstanding. In his Guardian article Sukhdev Sandhu described the Festival as “one of the most imaginative festivals to be staged in the UK for many years.”&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/mar/09/slow-cinema-fights-bournes-supremacy&lt;/ref&gt;

Highlights of AV Festival 2012 included: new commissions by [[Yoshi Wada]], Susan Stenger, [[Phill Niblock]], Jonathan Schipper and Torsten Lauschmann; the closing Festival ''Slowalk'' by [[Hamish Fulton]]; a tribute concert to John Cage; [[Kenneth Goldsmith]] in [[Morden Tower]]; and public readings of [[On Kawara]]’s ''One Million Years.''

In addition the Festival film programme focused on slowness and cinema, including special screenings with [[James Benning (film director)|James Benning]], [[Ben Rivers]] and [[Lav Diaz]]; concerts included a special tribute to [[Peter Christopherson]]; the Festival ran a 744-hour special online radio, and hundreds of people took part in a series of artist-led walks across the region.

=== AV Festival 2010: Energy ===
AV Festival 2010: Energy ran from 5 – 14 March 2010, and had the curatorial theme of energy. The Festival explored energy as a universal force that connects, transforms and renews life. It approached the theme from a scientific, technological, environmental and spiritual perspective. New commissions included a coal-fired computer, a café importing via social networks, a film tracking the movement of the sun, and compositions based on the energy of rivers.

The Festival included 24 exhibitions, 20 performances, 15 screenings, 14 talks, 3 symposia, 2 residencies and a café. This included working with 140 artists, on 18 new commissions and 15 UK premieres, in partnership with 31 venues. Over ten days there were 70,860 visits, an increase of 65% from 2008. The Festival contributed £480k of GVA to the local economy, and achieved £1.25 of economic output per pound invested. AV Festival 2010 won a Silver Award at the North East Tourism Awards.

Highlights of AV Festival 2010 included: new commissions by [[Charlemagne Palestine]], Graham Harwood, [[Kaffe Matthews]], Lee Patterson and Jana Winderen; [[Kate Rich]]’s ''Feral Trade Café'' with its daily menu; exhibitions by [[Felix Gonzalez-Torres]], Felix Hess, artificiel and [[Zilvinas Kempinas]]; and the closing night performance with [[Iain Sinclair]], [[Alan Moore]], Susan Stenger, [[FM Einheit]] and Stephen O’Malley. In addition the Festival included a focus on recycled film with [[Kenneth Anger]], [[Craig Baldwin]] and [[Rick Prelinger]], an underwater concert by [[Cluster (band)|Cluster]], [[Liliane Lijn]]’s ''Power Game'' and a guest lecture by [[Gustav Metzger]].

=== AV Festival 2008: Broadcast ===
AV Festival 2008: Broadcast ran from 28 February – 8 March 2008, and had the curatorial theme of broadcast. The UK began to switch off analogue television signals in 2007, paving the way for television to become entirely digital. At the same time the internet and mobile networks have created opportunities for us to broadcast ourselves in entirely new ways. AV Festival 2008 created a catalyst for debate about the future of broadcasting, and celebrated the history of transmission.

AV Festival 2008 took place across Newcastle, Gateshead, Sunderland and Middlesbrough, and included 12 exhibitions, 37 screenings, 18 performances, 18 talks, symposia and workshops, 14 new commissions, 4 launch events and 3 radio stations. Over ten-days there were a total of 43,038 visits, a 26% increase from 2006. The Festival introduced new audiences to the work: 42% had not been to a similar event before. AV Festival 2008 won a Silver Award at the North East Tourism Awards.

Highlights of AV Festival 2008 included new commissions by Chris Watson and Marko Peljhan, the live performance of John Cage’s ''[[Variations VII]]'', and solo exhibitions by [[Harun Farocki]], [[Sonia Boyce]], Staalplaat Soundsystem and Joyce Hinterding. In addition the Festival ran three FM radio stations across the region, a special tribute to the radiophonic workshop, performances by [[Jean-Jacques Perrey]], a series of TV screenings at the cinema, and a symposia about music, sound and broadcasting technologies.

=== AV Festival 2006: LifeLike ===
AV Festival 2006: LifeLike ran from 2 – 12 March 2006, and had the curatorial theme of life sciences. Our perceptions of what life is, when it starts and ends, and how it works have been transformed by science and technology. AV Festival 2006 featured works that show how technology can mimic, impersonate and simulate life. It also explored the way that biotechnology, genetic engineering and cloning have radically altered the way we imagine life.

AV Festival 2006 took place across Newcastle, Gateshead, Sunderland and Middlesbrough, and included 13 exhibitions, 29 screenings, 8 performances, 17 talks, symposia and workshops, 9 new commissions, and 4 launch events. Over ten days it achieved 34,142 visits, of which 88% were new audiences to the Festival. AV Festival 2006 featured the Festival's first exhibition programme with special preview evenings, including a new installation by [[Anthony McCall]].

Highlights of AV Festival 2006 included: new commissions by [[Ryoji Ikeda]], [[Michael Nyman]], [[Gina Czarnecki]], Anthony McCall and Kenneth Rinaldo; a live performance by [[Alva Noto]] ([[Carsten Nicolai]]); Suguro Goto’s robotic orchestra; and the premiere of [[Critical Art Ensemble]]’s ''Marching Plague''. In addition there was a comprehensive film programme about how cinema has played a central role in our visions of the future, and a two-day symposium exploring life from social, scientific, technological, ethical and artistic perspectives.

=== AV Festival 2003: Pilot Edition  ===
AV Festival 2003 took place primarily in cinema spaces across the region, including the recently closed and abandoned Odeon (Paramount) Cinema on Pilgrim Street in Newcastle. Highlights included: the live performance of ''[[Man with a Movie Camera]]'' by [[The Cinematic Orchestra]]; ''Time Code Live'' with [[Mike Figgis]]; and [[Matthew Barney]]’s ''[[The Cremaster Cycle]].'' In addition there was a Mike Figgis mini-retrospective, a series of [[onedotzero]] programmes, artist films at Cineside including [[Lillian Schwartz]], newly commissioned Richard Fenwick films, and a live performance by Tina Frank.

The '''Action On Film International Film Festival''', also known as the '''Action On Film Festival''', was founded in 2004.  It was held in California until 2017 when it moved to the Palms Hotel and Casino in  [[Las Vegas]].  As a hub for many returning filmmakers, AOF has become an Official Distributor to SHORTS.TV as well as programming Feature Films for a number of Indie Theaters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aoffest.com|title=aoffest|website=aoffest|access-date=2016-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Action on Film International Film Festival was founded in 2004 by Del Weston.&lt;ref name=oc&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/festival-103606-film-aof.html|title=Action on Film Festival springs into action|last=Choi|first=Sarah|work=[[The Orange County Register]]|date=2008-07-23|accessdate=2014-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pw2009&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pasadenaweekly.com/cms/story/detail/action_makes_a_comeback/7525/|title=Action makes a comeback|last=Kozlowski|first=Carl|work=[[Pasadena Weekly]]|date=2009-07-23|accessdate=2014-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After being disappointed by a bad experience, Weston sought to create a festival where filmmakers could showcase their films.&lt;ref name=pw2008&gt;{{cite news|url=http://pasadenaweekly.com/cms/story/detail/lights_camera/6208/|title=Lights, Camera...|last=Kozlowski|first=Carl|work=[[Pasadena Weekly]]|date=2008-07-24|accessdate=2014-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;   It was first held in [[Long Beach, California]] as a part of the [[Long Beach International Karate Championships|Long Beach International Martial Arts Championships]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="56550">The '''aftermath of World War I''' saw drastic political, cultural, economic, and social change across Eurasia (Europe and Asia), Africa, and even in areas outside those that were directly involved. Four empires collapsed due to the war, old countries were abolished, new ones were formed, boundaries were redrawn, international organizations were established, and many new and old ideologies took a firm hold in people's minds.

[[World War I]] also had the effect of bringing political transformation to most of the principal parties involved in the conflict, transforming them into [[Electoral democracy|electoral democracies]] by bringing near-[[universal suffrage]] for the first time in history, as in Germany ([[German federal election, 1919]]), Great Britain  ([[United Kingdom general election, 1918]]), and Turkey ([[Turkish general election, 1923]]).

==Blockade of Germany==
{{Main article|Blockade of Germany}}
Through the period from the armistice on 11 November 1918 until the signing of the peace treaty with Germany on 28 June 1919, the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] maintained the naval blockade of Germany that had begun during the war. As Germany was dependent on imports, it is estimated that 523,000 civilians had lost their lives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhm.de/lemo/html/wk1/wirtschaft/versorgung/index.html 'german casualties']&lt;/ref&gt; N. P. Howard, of the University of Sheffield, claims that a further quarter of a million more died from disease or starvation in the eight-month period following the conclusion of the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libcom.org/files/blockade%20Germany_0.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The continuation of the blockade after the fighting ended, as author [[Robert Leckie (author)|Robert Leckie]] wrote in ''[[Delivered From Evil]]'', did much to "torment the Germans&amp;nbsp;... driving them with the fury of despair into the arms of the devil."{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} The terms of the [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|Armistice]] did allow food to be shipped into Germany, but the Allies required that Germany provide the means (the shipping) to do so. The German government was required to use its gold reserves, being unable to secure a loan from the United States.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Historian Sally Marks claims that while "Allied warships remained in place against a possible resumption of hostilities, the Allies offered food and medicine after the armistice, but Germany refused to allow its ships to carry supplies". Further, Marks states that despite the problems facing the Allies, from the German government, "Allied food shipments arrived in Allied ships before the charge made at Versailles".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marks |first=Sally |chapter=1918 and After: The Postwar Era |title=The Origins of the Second World War Reconsidered |editor-last=Martel |editor-first=Gordon |location=Boston |publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin |year=1986 |page=19 |isbn=0-04-940084-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This position is also supported by Elisabeth Gläser who notes that an Allied task force, to help feed the German population, was established in early 1919 and that by May 1919 " Germany [had] became the chief recipient of American and Allied food shipments". Gläser further claims that during the early months of 1919, while the main relief effort was being planned, France provided food shipments to Bavaria and the Rhineland. She further claims that the German government delayed the relief effort by refusing to surrender their merchant fleet to the Allies. Finally, she concludes that "the very success of the relief effort had in effect deprived the [Allies] of a credible threat to induce Germany to sign the Treaty of Versailles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gläser |first= |title=The Treaty of Versailles: A Reassessment After 75 Years |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1998 |pages=388–391 |isbn=0-521-62132-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it is also the case that for eight months following the end of hostilities, the blockade was continually in place, with some estimates that a further 100,000 casualties among German civilians due to starvation were caused, on top of the hundreds of thousands which already had occurred. Food shipments, furthermore, had been entirely dependent on Allied goodwill, causing at least in part the post-hostilities irregularity.&lt;ref&gt;Germany. Gesundheits-Amt.

==Treaty of Versailles==
{{Main article|Treaty of Versailles}}
[[Image:Mass demonstration in front of the Reichstag against the Treaty of Versailles.jpg|thumb|left|Demonstration against the Treaty in front of the [[Reichstag building]]]]
After the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] of 1919, the signing of the Treaty of Versailles on 28 June 1919, between Germany on the one side and France, Italy, Britain and other minor allied powers on the other, officially ended war between those countries. Other treaties ended the relationships of the United States and the other Central Powers. Included in the 440 articles of the Treaty of Versailles were the demands that Germany officially accept [[Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles|responsibility for starting the war]] and pay [[World War I reparations|economic reparations]]. The treaty drastically limited the German military machine: German troops were reduced to 100,000 and the country was prevented from possessing major military armaments such as tanks, warships, armored vehicles and submarines.

==Influenza epidemic==
Historians continue to argue about the impact the [[1918 flu pandemic]] had on the outcome of the war. It has been posited that the Central Powers may have been exposed to the viral wave before the Allies. The resulting casualties having greater effect, having been incurred during the war, as opposed to the allies who suffered the brunt of the pandemic after the Armistice. When the extent of the epidemic was realized, the respective censorship programs of the Allies and Central Powers limited the public's knowledge regarding the true extent of the disease. Because Spain was neutral, their media was free to report on the Flu, giving the impression that it began there. This misunderstanding led to contemporary reports naming it the "[[Spanish flu]]." Investigative work by a British team led by virologist John Oxford of St Bartholomew's Hospital and the Royal London Hospital, identified a major troop staging and hospital camp in Étaples, France as almost certainly being the center of the 1918 flu pandemic. A significant precursor virus was harbored in birds, and mutated to pigs that were kept near the front.&lt;ref&gt;^ Connor, Steve, "Flu epidemic traced to Great War transit camp", The Guardian (UK), Saturday, 8 January 2000. Accessed 2009-05-09. Archived 11 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The exact number of deaths is unknown but about 50 million people are estimated to have died from the influenza outbreak worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/books//html/7.html NAP]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.influenzareport.com/ir/overview.htm Influenza Report]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, a study found that, "The 1918 virus strain developed in birds and was similar to the [[H5N1|'bird flu']] that in the 21st century spurred fears of another worldwide pandemic, yet proved to be a normal treatable virus that did not produce a heavy impact on the world's health."&lt;ref&gt;http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/10/1005_051005_bird_flu.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethnic minorities==
The dissolution of the German, Russian, Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires created a number of new countries in eastern Europe and the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Mazower, "Minorities and the League of Nations in interwar Europe." ''Daedalus'' 126.2 (1997): 47-63. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20027428 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of them, such as Czechoslovakia and Poland, had substantial ethnic minorities who were sometimes not fully satisfied with the new boundaries that cut them off from fellow ethnics.  For example, Czechoslovakia had [[Germans in Czechoslovakia (1918–1938)|Germans]], [[Poles in Czechoslovakia|Poles]], [[Ruthenians and Ukrainians in Czechoslovakia (1918–1938)|Ruthenians and Ukrainians]], [[Slovaks in Czechoslovakia (1918–1938)|Slovaks]] and [[Hungarians in Slovakia|Hungarians]]. The [[League of Nations]] sponsored various [[Minority Treaties]] in an attempt to deal with the problem, but with the decline of the League in the 1930s, these treaties became increasingly unenforceable. One consequence of the massive redrawing of borders and the political changes in the aftermath of the war was the large number of European refugees. These and the refugees of the [[Russian Civil War]] led to the creation of the [[Nansen passport]].

Ethnic minorities made the location of the frontiers generally unstable. Where the frontiers have remained unchanged since 1918, there has often been the expulsion of an ethnic group, such as the [[Sudeten Germans]]. Economic and military cooperation amongst these small states was minimal, ensuring that the defeated powers of Germany and the Soviet Union retained a latent capacity to dominate the region. In the immediate aftermath of the war, defeat drove [[Germany–Soviet Union relations before 1941|cooperation between Germany and the Soviet Union]] but ultimately these two powers would compete to dominate eastern Europe.

==Political upheavals==
{{main|International relations (1919–1939)}}

===New nations break free===
German and Austrian forces in 1918 defeated the Russian armies, and the new communist government in Moscow signed the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] in March 1918. In that treaty, Russia renounced all claims to [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Ukraine]], and the territory of [[Congress Poland]], and it was left to Germany and Austria-Hungary "to determine the future status of these territories in agreement with their population." Later on, [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s government also renounced the [[Partitions of Poland|Partition of Poland treaty]], making it possible for Poland to claim its 1772 borders. However, the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was rendered obsolete when Germany was defeated later in 1918, leaving the status of much of eastern Europe in an uncertain position.

===Revolutions===
{{Main article|Revolutions of 1917–23}}
[[Image:Europe map 1919.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Political divisions of Europe in 1919 after the treaties of [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk|Brest-Litovsk]] and [[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles]] and before the treaties of [[Treaty of Trianon|Trianon]], [[Treaty of Kars|Kars]], [[Treaty of Riga|Riga]] and the creation of the Soviet Union, [[Irish Free State]] and [[Turkish Republic]]]]

A far-left and often explicitly [[Communist]] [[revolutionary wave]] occurred in several European countries in 1917-1920, notably in Germany and Hungary. The single most important event precipitated by the privations of World War I was the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution of 1917]].

===Germany===
{{Main article|German Revolution of 1918–19|Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic}}
In Germany, there was a socialist revolution which led to the brief establishment of a number of communist political systems in (mainly urban) parts of the country, the abdication of [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II]], and the creation of the [[Weimar Republic]].

On 28 June 1919 the Weimar Republic was forced, under threat of continued Allied advance, to sign the Treaty of Versailles. Germany viewed the one-sided treaty as a humiliation and as [[Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles|blaming it for the entire war]]. While this was not the intent of the treaty{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}, the notion took root in German society and was never accepted by nationalists, although it was argued by some, such as German historian [[Fritz Fischer]]. The German government disseminated [[propaganda]] to further promote this idea, and funded the [[Centre for the Study of the Causes of the War]] to this end.

132 billion gold marks ($31.5 billion, 6.6 billion pounds) were demanded from Germany in reparations, of which only 50 billion had to be paid. In order to finance the purchases of foreign currency required to pay off the reparations, the new German republic printed tremendous amounts of money – to disastrous effect. [[Hyperinflation]] plagued Germany between 1921 and 1923. In this period the worth of [[fiat money|fiat]] [[German Papiermark|Papiermark]]s with respect to the earlier [[commodity money|commodity]] [[German gold mark|Goldmark]]s was reduced to one trillionth (one million millionth) of its value.&lt;ref&gt;Table IV (page 441) of ''The Economics of Inflation'' by Costantino Bresciani-Turroni, published 1937.&lt;!--File:GermanyHyperChart.jpg--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1922 the Reparations Commission declared Germany in default, and on 11 January 1923 French and Belgian troops [[Occupation of the Ruhr|occupied the Ruhr]] until 1925.

The treaty required Germany to permanently reduce the size of its army to 100,000 men, and destroy their tanks, air force, and U-boat fleet (her capital ships, moored at [[Scapa Flow]], were [[Scuttling of the German fleet at Scapa Flow|scuttled by their crews]] to prevent them from falling into Allied hands).

Germany saw relatively small amounts of territory transferred to Denmark, Czechoslovakia, and Belgium, a larger amount to France (including the temporary French occupation of the Rhineland) and the greatest portion as part of a reestablished Poland. Germany's overseas colonies were divided between a number of Allied countries, most notably the United Kingdom in Africa, but it was the loss of the territory that composed the newly independent Polish state, including the German city of [[Free City of Danzig|Danzig]] and the separation of East Prussia from the rest of Germany, that caused the greatest outrage. Nazi propaganda would feed on a general German view that the treaty was unfair – many Germans never accepted the treaty as legitimate, and lent their political support to [[Adolf Hitler]].

===Russian Empire===
The Soviet Union benefited from Germany's loss, as one of the first terms of the armistice was the abrogation of the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]]. At the time of the armistice Russia was in the grips of a [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] which left more than seven million people dead and large areas of the country devastated. The nation as a whole suffered socially and economically. As to her border territories, [[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]] and [[Estonia]] gained independence. They were occupied again by the Soviet Union in 1940. [[Finland]] gained a lasting independence, though she repeatedly had to fight the Soviet Union for her borders. [[Armenia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], and [[Azerbaijan]] were established as independent states in the Caucasus region. These countries were proclaimed as Soviet Republics in 1922 and over time were absorbed into the Soviet Union. During the war, however, Turkey captured the Armenian territory around [[Artvin]], [[Kars]], and [[Igdir]], and these territorial losses became permanent. [[Romania]] gained [[Bessarabia]] from Russia. The Russian concession in [[Tianjin]] was occupied by the Chinese in 1920; in 1924 the Soviet Union renounced its claims to the district.

===Austria-Hungary=== &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Austria-Hungary]] --&gt;
{{Essay-like|section|date=December 2009}}
{{Main article|Treaty of Trianon|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)}}

With the war having turned decisively against the [[Central Powers]], the people of [[Austria-Hungary]] lost faith in their allied countries, and even before the armistice in November, radical [[nationalism]] had already led to several [[Declaration of independence|declarations of independence]] in south-central Europe after November 1918. As the central government had ceased to operate in vast areas, these regions found themselves without a government and many new groups attempted to fill the void. During this same period, the population was facing food shortages and was, for the most part, demoralized by the losses incurred during the war. Various political parties, ranging from ardent nationalists, to social democrats, to communists attempted to set up governments in the names of the different nationalities. In other areas, existing nation states such as [[Romania]] engaged regions that they considered to be theirs. These moves created de facto governments that complicated life for diplomats, idealists, and the Western allies.

The Western forces were officially supposed to occupy the old Empire, but rarely had enough troops to do so effectively. They had to deal with local authorities who had their own agenda to fulfill. At the peace conference in Paris the diplomats had to reconcile these authorities with the competing demands of the nationalists who had turned to them for help during the war, the strategic or political desires of the Western allies themselves, and other agendas such as a desire to implement the spirit of the Fourteen Points.

For example, in order to live up to the ideal of self-determination laid out in the Fourteen Points, Germans, whether Austrian or German, should be able to decide their own future and government. However, the French especially were concerned that an expanded Germany would be a huge security risk. Further complicating the situation, delegations such as the Czechs and Slovenians made strong claims on some German-speaking territories.

The result was treaties that compromised many ideals, offended many allies, and set up an entirely new order in the area. Many people hoped that the new nation states would allow for a new era of prosperity and peace in the region, free from the bitter quarrelling between nationalities that had marked the preceding fifty years. This hope proved far too optimistic. Changes in territorial configuration after World War I included:

* Establishment of the [[German Austria|Republic of German Austria]] and the [[Hungarian Democratic Republic]], disavowing any continuity with the empire and exiling the [[Habsburg]] family in perpetuity.
* Borders of newly independent Hungary did not include two-thirds of the lands of the former [[Kingdom of Hungary]], including areas where the ethnic Magyars were in a majority. The new republic of Austria maintained control over most of the predominantly German-controlled areas, but lost various other German majority lands in what was the [[Austrian Empire]].

[[File:Dissolution of Austria-Hungary.png|right|thumb|300px|Division of [[Austria-Hungary]] after World War I]]

* [[Bohemia]], [[Moravia]], [[Opava Silesia]] and the western part of the [[Duchy of Cieszyn]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Carpathian Ruthenia]] formed the new [[Czechoslovakia]].
* [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]], the eastern part of the [[Duchy of Cieszyn]], northern [[Orava (county)|County of Orava]] and northern [[Spisz]] were transferred to [[Republic of Poland|Poland]].
* the Southern half of the [[County of Tyrol]] and [[Trieste]] were granted to [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Italy]].
* [[Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia|Croatia-Slavonia]], [[Kingdom of Dalmatia|Dalmatia]], [[Slovenia]], [[Syrmia]] [[Banat, Bačka and Baranja]] were joined with [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] to form the [[Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], later [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].
* [[Transylvania]] and [[Bukovina]] became parts of [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]].
* The Austro-Hungarian [[Concessions in Tianjin#Austro-Hungarian concession|concession]] in [[Tianjin]] was ceded to the Republic of China.

These changes were recognized in, but not caused by, the Treaty of Versailles. They were subsequently further elaborated in the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain]] and the [[Treaty of Trianon]].

The 1919 treaties generally included guarantees of minority rights, but there was no enforcement mechanism.  The new states of eastern Europe mostly all had large ethnic minorities. Millions of Germans found themselves in the newly created countries as minorities. More than two million ethnic Hungarians found themselves living outside of Hungary in Slovakia, Romania and Yugoslavia. Many of these national minorities found themselves in hostile situations because the modern governments were intent on defining the national character of the countries, often at the expense of the other nationalities.  The interwar years were hard for religious minorities in the new states built around ethnic nationalism. The [[Jew]]s were especially distrusted because of their minority religion and distinct subculture.  This was a dramatic come-down from the days of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Although [[antisemitism]] had been widespread during Habsburg rule, Jews faced no official discrimination because they were, for the most part, ardent supporters of the multi-national state and the monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Marsha L. Rozenblit|title=Reconstructing a National Identity: The Jews of Habsburg Austria During World War I|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7CVl3obLidUC&amp;pg=PA163|year=2004|publisher=Oxford UP|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The economic disruption of the war and the end of the Austro-Hungarian [[customs union]] created great hardship in many areas. Although many states were set up as democracies after the war, one by one, with the exception of Czechoslovakia, they reverted to some form of authoritarian rule. Many quarreled amongst themselves but were too weak to compete effectively. Later, when Germany rearmed, the nation states of south-central Europe were unable to resist its attacks, and fell under German domination to a much greater extent than had ever existed in Austria-Hungary.

===Ottoman Empire===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Ottoman Empire]] --&gt;
{{Main article|Partitioning of the Ottoman Empire|Turkish War of Independence}}

At the end of the war, the Allies [[Occupation of Constantinople|occupied Constantinople]] ([[İstanbul]]) and the Ottoman government collapsed. The [[Treaty of Sèvres]], a plan designed by the Allies to dismember the remaining Ottoman territories, was signed on 10 August 1920, although it was never ratified by the Sultan.

The [[occupation of Smyrna]] by Greece on 18 May 1919 triggered a nationalist movement to rescind the terms of the treaty. [[Turkish National Movement|Turkish revolutionaries]] led by [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]], a successful Ottoman commander, rejected the terms enforced at Sèvres and under the guise of General Inspector of the Ottoman Army, left Istanbul for [[Samsun]] to organize the remaining Ottoman forces to resist the terms of the treaty. On the eastern front, the [[Turkish–Armenian War]] and signing of the [[Treaty of Kars]] with the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian S.F.S.R.]] took over territory lost to Armenia and post-Imperial Russia.&lt;ref name="kars=text"&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.amsi.ge/istoria/sab/yarsi.html Text of the Treaty of Kars] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070424044332/http://www.amsi.ge/istoria/sab/yarsi.html |date=2007-04-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the western front, the growing strength of the Turkish nationalist forces led Greece, with the backing of Britain, to invade deep into [[Anatolia]] in an attempt to deal a blow to the revolutionaries. At the [[Battle of Dumlupınar]], the Greek army was defeated and forced into retreat, leading to the burning of Smyrna and the withdrawal of Greece from Asia Minor. With the nationalists empowered, the army marched on to reclaim Istanbul, resulting in the [[Chanak Crisis]] in which the British Prime Minister, [[David Lloyd George]], was forced to resign. After Turkish resistance gained control over Anatolia and Istanbul, the Sèvres treaty was superseded by the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]] which formally ended all hostilities and led to the creation of the modern [[Turkey|Turkish Republic]]. As a result, Turkey became the only power of World War I to overturn the terms of its defeat, and negotiate with the Allies as an equal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/turkey/13.htm Countrystudies – Turkey]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lausanne Treaty formally acknowledged the new League of Nations mandates in the Middle East, the cession of their territories on the Arabian Peninsula, and British sovereignty over [[Cyprus]]. The League of Nations granted ''Class A'' mandates for the [[French Mandate of Syria and Lebanon]] and [[British Mandate of Mesopotamia]] and [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]], the latter comprising two autonomous regions: [[Mandate Palestine]] and the [[Emirate of Transjordan]]. Parts of the Ottoman Empire on the [[Arabian Peninsula]] became part of what is today [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Yemen]]. The [[dissolution of the Ottoman Empire]] became a pivotal milestone in the creation of the modern Middle East, the result of which bore witness to the creation of new conflicts and hostilities in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fromkin |first=David |year=1989 |title=A Peace to End All Peace: Creating the Modern Middle East 1914–1922 |location=New York |publisher=H. Holt |page=565 |isbn=0-8050-0857-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Great Britain===
In Britain, funding the war had a [[Post-WWI recession|severe economic cost]]. From being the world's largest overseas investor, it became one of its biggest debtors with interest payments forming around 40% of all government spending. [[Inflation]] more than doubled between 1914 and its peak in 1920, while the value of the [[Pound Sterling]] (consumer expenditure&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/rp99/rp99-020.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060219130455/http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/rp99/rp99-020.pdf |archivedate=2006-02-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;) fell by 61.2%. Reparations in the form of free German coal depressed local industry, precipitating the [[UK General Strike 1926|1926 General Strike]].

British private investments abroad were sold, raising £550 million. However, £250 million in new investment also took place during the war. The net financial loss was therefore approximately £300 million; less than two years investment compared to the pre-war average rate and more than replaced by 1928.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=A. J. P. |last=Taylor |title=English History, 1914–1945|location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1976|page=123 |isbn=0-19-821715-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Material loss was "slight": the most significant being 40% of the British merchant fleet sunk by German U-boats. Most of this was replaced in 1918 and all immediately after the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=A. J. P. |last=Taylor |title=English History, 1914–1945 |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1976 |page=122 |isbn=0-19-821715-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The military historian [[Correlli Barnett]] has argued that "in objective truth the Great War in no way inflicted crippling economic damage on Britain" but that the war "crippled the British ''psychologically'' but in no other way".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Correlli |last=Barnett |title=The Collapse of British Power |location=London |publisher=Pan |year=2002 |pages=424 and 426 |isbn=0-330-49181-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Less concrete changes include the growing assertiveness of [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] nations. Battles such as [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]] for Australia and New Zealand, and [[Battle of Vimy Ridge|Vimy Ridge]] for Canada led to increased national pride and a greater reluctance to remain subordinate to Britain, leading to the growth of diplomatic autonomy in the 1920s. These battles were often decorated in propaganda in these nations as symbolic of their power during the war.  Colonies such as the [[British Raj]] (India) and [[Nigeria]] also became increasingly assertive because of their participation in the war. The populations in these countries became increasingly aware of their own power and Britain's fragility.
[[File:The Girl He Left Behind Him.jpg|alt=|thumb|Cartoon predicting the aftermath of the war by Henry J. Glintenkamp, first published in ''[[The Masses]]'' in 1914]]

In Ireland, the delay in finding a resolution to the [[home rule]] issue, partly caused by the war, as well as the 1916 [[Easter Rising]] and a failed attempt to introduce [[Conscription Crisis of 1918|conscription in Ireland]], increased support for separatist radicals. This led indirectly to the outbreak of the [[Irish War of Independence]] in 1919. The creation of the [[Irish Free State]] that followed this conflict in effect represented a territorial loss for Britain that was all but equal to the loss sustained by Germany, (and furthermore, compared to Germany, a much greater loss in terms of its ratio to the country's prewar territory). Despite this, the [[Irish Free State]] remained a dominion within the British Empire.

After World War I women gained the right to vote as, during the war, they had had to fill-in for what were previously categorized as "men's jobs", thus showing the government that women were not as weak and incompetent as they thought. Also, there were several significant developments in medicine and technology as the injured had to be cared for and there were several new illnesses that medicine had to deal with.

===United States===

While disillusioned by the war, it having not achieved the high ideals promised by President [[Woodrow Wilson]], American [[International Chamber of Commerce|commercial interests]] did finance Europe's rebuilding and reparation efforts in Germany, at least until the onset of the [[Great Depression]]. American opinion on the propriety of providing aid to Germans and Austrians was split, as evidenced by an exchange of correspondence between [[Edgar Gott]], an executive with [[Boeing|The Boeing Company]] and Charles Osner, chairman of the Committee for the Relief of Destitute Women and Children in Germany and Austria. Gott argued that relief should first go to citizens of countries that had suffered at the hands of the [[Central Powers]], while Osner made an appeal for a more universal application of humanitarian ideals.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhlman, Erika A., [https://books.google.com/books?id=t7139hAmM6AC&amp;pg=PA120&amp;dq=edgar+gott&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pppwUYHlAsqNqgG2sIFI&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=edgar%20gott&amp;f=false Of Little Comfort]. 2012. pp.&amp;nbsp;120–121.&lt;/ref&gt; The American economic influence allowed the Great Depression to start a domino effect, pulling Europe in as well.

===France===
[[File:French enter Essen.jpg|thumb|French cavalry entering [[Essen]] during the occupation of the Ruhr.]]
[[Alsace-Lorraine]] returned to France, the region which had been ceded to Prussia in 1871 after the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. At the 1919 Peace Conference, Prime Minister [[Georges Clemenceau]]'s aim was to ensure that Germany would not seek revenge in the following years. To this purpose, the chief commander of the Allied forces, Marshal [[Ferdinand Foch]], had demanded that for the future protection of France the [[Rhine]] river should now form the border between France and Germany. Based on history, he was convinced that Germany would again become a threat, and, on hearing the terms of the Treaty of Versailles that had left Germany substantially intact, he observed that "This is not Peace. It is an Armistice for twenty years."

The destruction brought upon French territory was to be indemnified by the [[World War I reparations|reparations]] negotiated at Versailles. This financial imperative dominated France's foreign policy throughout the 1920s, leading to the 1923 [[Occupation of the Ruhr]] in order to force Germany to pay. However, Germany was unable to pay, and obtained support from the United States. Thus, the [[Dawes Plan]] was negotiated after Prime Minister [[Raymond Poincaré]]'s occupation of the Ruhr, and then the [[Young Plan]] in 1929.

Also extremely important in the War was the participation of [[French colonial troops]], including the Senegalese ''[[tirailleur]]s'', and troops from [[French Indochina|Indochina]], North Africa, and [[Madagascar]]. When these soldiers returned to their homelands and continued to be treated as second class citizens, many became the nuclei of pro-independence groups.

Furthermore, under the state of war declared during the hostilities, the French economy had been somewhat centralized in order to be able to shift into a "[[war economy]]", leading to a first breach with [[classical liberalism]].

Finally, the socialists' support of the National Union government (including [[Alexandre Millerand]]'s nomination as Minister of War) marked a shift towards the [[French Section of the Workers' International]]'s (SFIO) turn towards social democracy and participation in "bourgeois governments", although [[Léon Blum]] maintained a socialist rhetoric.

===Italy===
[[File:Fiume cheering D'Annunzio.jpg|thumb|right|Residents of [[Fiume]] cheering D'Annunzio and his ''Legionari'', September 1919. At the time, Fiume had 22,488 (62% of the population) Italians in a total population of 35,839 inhabitants.]]
	
In 1882 [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] joined with the [[German Empire]] and the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]] to form the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]]. However, even if relations with [[Berlin]] became very friendly, the alliance with [[Vienna]] remained purely formal, as the Italians were keen to acquire [[Trentino]] and [[Trieste]], parts of the Austro-Hungarian empire populated by Italians.

During [[World War I]] Italy aligned with the Allies, instead of joining Germany and Austria. This could happen since the alliance formally had merely defensive prerogatives, while the Central Empires were the ones who started the offensive. With the [[Treaty of London (1915)|Treaty of London]], Britain secretly offered Italy [[Trentino]] and [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]] as far as [[Brenner, South Tyrol|Brenner]], [[Trieste]] and [[Istria]], all the [[Dalmatia]]n coast except [[Fiume]], full ownership of Albanian [[Vlorë|Valona]] and a protectorate over [[Italian protectorate over Albania|Albania]], [[Antalya]] in [[Turkey]] and a share of the [[Partitioning of the Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] and [[German colonial empire#Confiscation|German colonial empire]], in exchange for Italy siding against the Central Empires{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}.
 
After the victory, [[Vittorio Orlando]], Italy's [[President of the Council of Ministers of Italy|President of the Council of Ministers]], and [[Sidney Sonnino]], its [[Foreign Minister of Italy|Foreign Minister]], were sent as the Italian representatives to [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris]] with the aim of gaining the promised territories and as much other land as possible. In particular, there was an especially strong opinion about the status of [[Fiume]], which they believed was rightly Italian due to Italian population, in agreement with [[Woodrow Wilson|Wilson]]'s [[Fourteen Points]], the ninth of which read:
		 		
''"A readjustment of the frontiers of Italy should be effected along clearly recognizable lines of nationality''".

Nevertheless, by the end of the war the Allies realized they had made contradictory agreements with other Nations, especially regarding [[Central Europe]] and the [[Middle-East]]. In the meetings of the "Big Four", in which Orlando's powers of diplomacy were inhibited by his lack of English, the Great powers were only willing to offer [[Trentino]] to the [[Brenner, South Tyrol|Brenner]], the Dalmatian port of [[Zadar|Zara]], the island of [[Lastovo|Lagosta]] and a couple of small German colonies. All other territories were promised to other nations and the great powers were worried about Italy's imperial ambitions; Wilson, in particular, was a staunch supporter of Yugoslav rights on Dalmatia against Italy and despite the Treaty of London which he did not recognize.&lt;ref&gt;But perhaps the major hindrance to Italy's aims were the different opinions of Orlando and Sonnino: the first was decided to obtain Fiume and forsake Dalmatia, Sonnino did not mean to abandon Dalmatia and would have willingly left Fiume. This indecision proved fatal for Italy, which did not gain either of the territories.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this, Orlando left the conference in a rage. This simply favored Britain and France, which divided among themselves the former Ottoman and German territories in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;(Jackson, 1938)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Italy, the discontent was relevant: [[irredentists|Irredentism]] (see: ''[[Italian irredentism|irredentismo]]'') claimed Fiume and Dalmatia as Italian lands; many felt the Country had taken part in a meaningless war without getting any serious benefits. This idea of a "mutilated victory" (''[[Mutilated victory|vittoria mutilata]]'') was the reason which led to the ''[[Italian Regency of Carnaro#Impresa di Fiume|Impresa di Fiume]]'' ("''Fiume Exploit''"). On September 12, 1919, the nationalist poet [[Gabriele d'Annunzio]] led around 2,600 troops from the [[Royal Italian Army]] (the [[Granatieri di Sardegna Mechanized Brigade|Granatieri di Sardegna]]), nationalists and irredentists, into a seizure of the city, forcing the withdrawal of the inter-Allied (American, British and French) occupying forces.
 	
The "mutilated victory" (''[[Mutilated victory|vittoria mutilata]]'') became an important part of [[Italian Fascism]] propaganda.

===China===
The [[Republic of China (1912-49)|Republic of China]] had been one of the Allies; during the war, it had sent [[Chinese Labour Corps|thousands of labourers]] to France. At the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference in 1919]], the Chinese delegation called for an end to Western imperialistic institutions in China, but was rebuffed. China requested at least the formal restoration of its territory of [[Jiaozhou Bay]], under German colonial control since 1898. But the western Allies rejected China's request, instead granting transfer to Japan of all of Germany's pre-war territory and rights in China. Subsequently, China did not sign the Treaty of Versailles, instead signing a separate peace treaty with Germany in 1921.

The Austro-Hungarian and German [[concessions in Tianjin]] were placed under the administration of the Chinese government; in 1920 they occupied the Russian area as well.

The western Allies' substantial accession to Japan's territorial ambitions at China's expense led to the [[May Fourth Movement]] in China, a social and political movement that had profound influence over subsequent Chinese history. The May Fourth Movement is often cited as the birth of [[Chinese nationalism]], and both the [[Kuomintang]] and [[Chinese Communist Party]] consider the Movement to be an important period in their own histories.

===Japan===
Because of the treaty that Japan had signed with Great Britain in 1902, Japan was one of the Allies during the war. With British assistance, Japanese forces attacked Germany's territories in Shandong province in China, including the East Asian coaling base of the Imperial German navy. The German forces were defeated and surrendered to Japan in November 1914. The Japanese navy also succeeded in seizing several of Germany's island possessions in the Western Pacific: the [[Marianas]], [[Caroline Islands|Carolines]], and [[Marshall Islands]].

At the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference in 1919]], Japan was granted all of Germany's pre-war rights in [[Shandong]] province in China (despite China also being one of the Allies during the war): outright possession of the territory of [[Jiaozhou Bay]], and favorable commercial rights throughout the rest of the province, as well as a Mandate over the German Pacific island possessions that the Japanese navy had taken. Also, Japan was granted a permanent seat on the Council of the League of Nations. Nevertheless, the Western powers refused Japan's request for the inclusion of a [[Racial Equality Proposal, 1919|"racial equality" clause]] as part of the Treaty of Versailles. Shandong reverted to Chinese control in 1922 after mediation by the United States during the [[Washington Naval Conference]]. [[Weihai]] followed in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen G.

==Social trauma==
{{Cleanup rewrite|2=section|date=May 2009}}
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2009}}

The experiences of the war in the west are commonly assumed to have led to a sort of collective [[national trauma]] afterward for all of the participating countries. The optimism of [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|1900]] was entirely gone and those who fought became what is known as "the [[Lost Generation]]" because they never fully recovered from their suffering. For the next few years, much of Europe mourned privately and publicly; memorials were erected in thousands of villages and towns.

So many British men of marriageable age died or were injured that the students of one girls' school were warned that only 10% would marry.{{r|cable200709015}}{{r|nicholson2008}}{{rp|20,245}} The 1921 [[United Kingdom Census]] found 19,803,022 women and 18,082,220 men in England and Wales, a difference of 1.72 million which newspapers called the "Surplus Two Million".&lt;ref name="nicholson2008"&gt;{{cite book | title=Singled Out: How Two Million British Women Survived Without Men After the First World War | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Nicholson, Virginia | year=2008 | isbn=0-19-537822-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|22–23}} In the 1921 census there were 1,209 single women aged 25 to 29 for every 1,000 men. In 1931 50% were still single, and 35% of them did not marry while still able to bear children.&lt;ref name="cable200709015"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-481882/Condemned-virgins-The-million-women-robbed-war.html | title=Condemned to be virgins: The two million women robbed by the war | work=Daily Mail | date=2007-09-15 | accessdate=May 1, 2011 | author=Cable, Amanda}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 1923, [[Stanley Baldwin]] recognized a new strategic reality that faced Britain in a disarmament speech. Poison gas and the aerial bombing of civilians were new developments of the First World War. The British civilian population, for many centuries, had not had any serious reason to fear invasion. So the new threat of poison gas dropped from enemy bombers excited a grossly exaggerated view of the civilian deaths that would occur on the outbreak of any future war. Baldwin expressed this in his statement that "[[The bomber will always get through]]." The traditional British policy of a balance of power in Europe no longer safeguarded the British home population. Out of this fear came appeasement. It is notable that neither Baldwin nor [[Neville Chamberlain]] fought in the war, but the anti-appeasers [[Antony Eden]], [[Harold Macmillan]] and [[Winston Churchill]] did.

One gruesome reminder of the sacrifices of the generation was the fact that this was one of the first times in international conflict whereby more men died in battle than from disease, which was the main cause of deaths in most previous wars. The [[Russo-Japanese War]] was another conflict where battle deaths outnumbered disease deaths, but it was fought on a much smaller scale between just two nations.

This social trauma made itself manifest in many different ways. Some people were revolted by [[nationalism]] and what they believed it had caused, so they began to work toward a more [[internationalism (politics)|internationalist]] world through organizations such as the League of Nations. [[Pacifism]] became increasingly popular. Others had the opposite reaction, feeling that only military strength could be relied upon for protection in a chaotic and inhumane world that did not respect hypothetical notions of civilization. Certainly a sense of disillusionment and [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynicism]] became pronounced. [[Nihilism]] grew in popularity. Many people believed that the war heralded the end of the world as they had known it, including the collapse of [[capitalism]] and [[imperialism]]. [[Communist]] and [[socialist]] movements around the world drew strength from this theory, enjoying a level of popularity they had never known before. These feelings were most pronounced in areas directly or particularly harshly affected by the war, such as central Europe, Russia and France.

Artists such as [[Otto Dix]], [[George Grosz]], [[Ernst Barlach]], and [[Käthe Kollwitz]] represented their experiences, or those of their society, in blunt paintings and sculpture. Similarly, authors such as [[Erich Maria Remarque]] wrote grim novels detailing their experiences. These works had a strong impact on society, causing a great deal of controversy and highlighting conflicting interpretations of the war. In Germany, nationalists including the [[Nazism|Nazis]] believed that much of this work was [[Degenerate art|degenerate]] and undermined the cohesion of society as well as dishonoring the dead.

==Remains of ammunition==
{{Main article|Iron harvest}}

Throughout the areas where trenches and fighting lines were located, such as the [[Champagne, France|Champagne]] region of France, quantities of [[unexploded ordnance]] have remained, some of which remains dangerous, continuing to cause injuries and occasional fatalities in the 21st century. Some are found by farmers ploughing their fields and have been called the [[iron harvest]]. Some of this ammunition contains [[chemical warfare|toxic]] chemical products such as [[mustard gas]]. Cleanup of major battlefields is a continuing task with no end in sight for decades to come. Squads remove, defuse or destroy hundreds of tons of unexploded ammunition every year in Belgium, France, and Germany.

The '''Aleppo offensive (August–September 2016)''' was a [[Syrian Army]] counter-offensive launched on the southern outskirts of [[Aleppo]] in mid-September 2016. The aim of the offensive was to recapture territory lost due to a [[Aleppo offensive (June–July 2016)|rebel offensive]] earlier in August and besiege the rebel-held part of Aleppo once again.

==The offensive==
===Fighting at the 1070 Housing Project===
Between 11 and 17 August, the Army launched several counter-attacks, primarily against the 1070 Housing Project.&lt;ref name="Saif"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/battle-aleppo-field-report/|title=Battle of Aleppo: Field Report|first=Izat|last=Charkatli|date=14 August 2016|publisher=[[Al-Masdar News]]|accessdate=15 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/jihadists-foil-first-syrian-army-offensive-southern-aleppo/|title=Jihadists foil first Syrian Army offensive in southern Aleppo|first=Leith|last=Fadel|date=12 August 2016|publisher=|accessdate=26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/syrian-army-advances-southern-aleppo-amid-russian-airstrikes/|title=Syrian Army advances in southern Aleppo amid Russian airstrikes|first=Leith|last=Fadel|date=13 August 2016|publisher=[[Al-Masdar News]]|accessdate=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the fighting on 11 August, 29 government and up to 20 rebel fighters were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidesourcenews.com/#!BREAKING-Rebels-Repel-HUGE-SAA-Attack-in-Aleppo/cjds/57ac563a0cf2460a62ee65b2|title=The Inside Source|publisher=|accessdate=26 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160830231409/http://www.insidesourcenews.com/#!BREAKING-Rebels-Repel-HUGE-SAA-Attack-in-Aleppo/cjds/57ac563a0cf2460a62ee65b2|archive-date=30 August 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 17 August, government forces recaptured about 70 percent of the district.&lt;ref name="technical"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/field-report-syrian-army-storms-technical-base-southern-aleppo/|title=Field Report: Syrian Army storms Technical Base in southern Aleppo|first=Zen|last=Adra|date=17 August 2016|publisher=[[Al-Masdar News]]|accessdate=18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="saareatreats"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidesourcenews.com/#!SAA-Retreats-From-The-Technical-College/cjds/57b557c40cf25814fdca64f0|title=SAA Retreats From The Technical College!|publisher=|accessdate=26 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160830231409/http://www.insidesourcenews.com/#!SAA-Retreats-From-The-Technical-College/cjds/57b557c40cf25814fdca64f0|archive-date=30 August 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early on 14 August, a large rebel attack was launched against the Army-held cement plant, in an attempt to enlarge the four kilometer wide rebel supply line. The assault was repelled after heavy fighting&lt;ref name="complete"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidesourcenews.com/#!Complete-Aleppo-Battle-Report/cjds/57b15db60cf23f8fc3b69d06|title=The Inside Source|publisher=|accessdate=26 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160830231409/http://www.insidesourcenews.com/#!Complete-Aleppo-Battle-Report/cjds/57b15db60cf23f8fc3b69d06|archive-date=30 August 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; for more than a day, with 35 rebels and 17 soldiers being killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-37083029|title=Syria conflict: Bus blast kills rebels near Turkey border - BBC News|publisher=|accessdate=26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the evening of 15 August, the Army and Hezbollah launched a new counter-attack at the 1070 Al-Hamdaniyah Housing Project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/syrian-army-hezbollah-begin-counter-attack-southern-aleppo/|title=Syrian Army, Hezbollah begin counter-attack in southern Aleppo|first=Leith|last=Fadel|date=15 August 2016|publisher=[[Al-Masdar News]]|accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the next morning finally broke through the first rebel defense line, reportedly securing around 80% of the district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/syrian-army-hezbollah-seize-80-percent-key-southern-aleppo-district/|title=Syrian Army, Hezbollah seize 80 percent of key southern Aleppo district|first=Leith|last=Fadel|date=15 August 2016|publisher=[[Al-Masdar News]]|accessdate=17 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle for the Military Academy===

On 17 August, after capturing most of the 1070 Al-Hamdaniyah Housing Project, government forces also stormed the Air Force Technical Base of the Al-Assad Military Academy. The former government commander of the base Brig. Gen. Deeb Bazi was killed as he led the assault.&lt;ref name="technical" /&gt;&lt;ref name="saareatreats"/&gt; Unable to fortify their position in the Air Force Base, the government forces eventually retreated as the rebels launched a counter-attack.&lt;ref name="saareatreats"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/jihadist-repel-syrian-army-attack-ramousah-base/|title=Jihadist repel Syrian Army attack on Ramousah Base|first=Izat|last=Charkatli|date=18 August 2016|publisher=[[Al-Masdar News]]|accessdate=18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, government forces captured the villages of Al-Qarassi, Tal Sanourabat and Al-‘Amariyah in the southern Aleppo countryside.

On 19 August, Republican Guard reinforcements from [[Damascus]] arrived in Aleppo for a new assault against the Aleppo Artillery Academy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/syrian-army-reinforcements-pour-southern-aleppo-next-offensive/|title=Syrian Army reinforcements pour into southern Aleppo for next offensive|first=Leith|last=Fadel|date=19 August 2016|publisher=[[Al-Masdar News]]|accessdate=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which began later that day. Meanwhile, government forces, supported by the IRGC and Shia militas, also launched another attack to capture Al-Qarassi, which was considered as the gateway to the strategically significant town of [[Khan Tuman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/syrian-army-hezbollah-launch-new-attack-key-military-site-southern-aleppo/|title=Syrian Army, Hezbollah launch new attack at key military site in southern Aleppo|first=Leith|last=Fadel|date=19 August 2016|publisher=[[Al-Masdar News]]|accessdate=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following night, government forces seized Tal Al-Aqra&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/breaking-syrian-army-launches-biggest-attack-key-military-base-southern-aleppo/|title=[Breaking] Syrian Army launches biggest attack on key military base in southern Aleppo|first=Leith|last=Fadel|date=20 August 2016|publisher=[[Al-Masdar News]]|accessdate=20 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thereby cut the Aleppo Artillery Academy's rebel defenders off from their main force.

On 21 August, government forces captured Umm Qara hill that overlooks the Khan Touman-Ramouseh Road near Al-Qarassi,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.syriahr.com/en/?p=49606 Continued clashes and advances for the regime in Aleppo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220213955/http://www.syriahr.com/en/?p=49606 |date=20 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="insidesourcenews.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidesourcenews.com/#!SAA-Counter-Attacks-in-South-Aleppo/cjds/57b9a3420cf2416a2e1cf879|title=The Inside Source|publisher=|accessdate=9 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160830231409/http://www.insidesourcenews.com/#!SAA-Counter-Attacks-in-South-Aleppo/cjds/57b9a3420cf2416a2e1cf879|archive-date=30 August 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as SyriaTel hill.&lt;ref name="insidesourcenews.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/syrian-army-captures-syriatel-hill-southern-aleppo/|title=Syrian Army captures SyriaTel Hill in southern Aleppo|first=Leith|last=Fadel|date=21 August 2016|publisher=|accessdate=26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 21 and 24 August, the rebels launched four counter-attacks in an attempt to recapture Umm Qara hill, with all attacks eventually being repelled.

On 22 August, the pro-government forces continued their offensive, taking control of the Al-Ramouseh Roundabout and Bridge, and later on storming the Aleppo Artillery Academy, resulting in a fierce battle with the rebel defenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/syrian-army-enters-key-military-base-southern-aleppo/|title=Syrian Army enters key military base in southern Aleppo|first=Leith|last=Fadel|date=22 August 2016|publisher=[[Al-Masdar News]]|accessdate=22 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, government troops were pushed back from the Academy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.syriahr.com/en/?p=49748 Continued clashes in Aleppo after an attack by regime forces on the area]&lt;/ref&gt; Between 23 and 27 August, the pro-government forces launched several attacks on both the Aleppo Technical College and the 1070 Housing Project; no progress was made at the latter, though government forces managed to gain a foothold inside the college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mobile.almasdarnews.com/article/syrian-army-storms-southern-aleppo-military-base/|title=Syrian Army storms southern Aleppo military base|first=Leith|last=Fadel|date=23 August 2016|publisher=[[Al-Masdar News]]|accessdate=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/map-syrian-army-hezbollah-attack-jaysh-al-fateh-southern-aleppo/|title=[Map] Syrian Army, Hezbollah attack Jaysh Al-Fateh in southern Aleppo|first=Leith|last=Fadel|date=25 August 2016|publisher=[[Al-Masdar News]]|accessdate=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/syrian-army-hezbollah-storm-aleppo-technical-college/|title=Syrian Army, Hezbollah storm Aleppo Technical College|first=Leith|last=Fadel|date=27 August 2016|publisher=|accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the pro-government forces failed to make further advances at the Technical College, they instead concentrated on the nearby, strategically important hill of Tal Sanourbat.

On 5 September, rebel frontlines in southern Aleppo collapsed, with pro-government forces overrunning three villages, three hills, two factories, two storage facilities, an Air Defense Base and a quarry.

[[File:Mohammad adil rais-Caliph Ali's empire 661.PNG|226px|right]]
'''Ali''' was the [[Caliphate|caliph]] between 656 and 661 CE, one of the hardest periods in [[Muslim history]], coinciding with the [[First Fitna|first Muslim civil war]]. He reigned over the [[Rashidun empire]] which extended from [[Central Asia]] in the east to [[North Africa]] in the west. He became known as a both just and fair ruler.

==Selection as Caliph==
[[File:Rashidun Caliph Ali ibn Abi Talib - علي بن أبي طالب.svg|thumb|[[Ali]] is credited as the first male to convert to [[Islam]].]]

After the assassination of the third Caliph, Uthman Ibn Affan, at the close of the Siege of Uthman, the selection of a new Caliph 
encountered difficulties. The rebels, comprising [[Muhajerin]], [[Ansar (Islam)|Ansar]], [[Egypt]]ians, [[Kufa]]ns and [[Bassorah|Basntes]], and the [[Kharijites]], were divided between three candidates: Ali, [[Talhah]] and [[Zubayr ibn al-Awam|Al-Zubayr]]. First they referred to Ali and asked him to accept the caliphate. Also some [[Sahaba|Companions of Muhammad]] tried to persuade him to accept the office.&lt;ref name="Sermon 3"&gt;[http://www.nahjulbalagha.org/SermonDetail.php?Sermon=3 Nahj Al-Balagha Sermon 3] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923213833/http://www.nahjulbalagha.org/SermonDetail.php?Sermon=3 |date=2009-09-23 }}

You should know that if I respond to you I would lead you as I know and would not care about whatever one may say or abuse. If you leave me then I am the same as you are. It is possible I would listen to and obey whomever you make in charge of your affairs.

Then rebels offered the caliphate to Talhah and Al-Zubayr and some other companions but they refused it too. Therefore, they threatened that, unless the people of Medina choose a caliph within one day, they would be forced to take some drastic action. In order to resolve the deadlock all of the Muslims gathered in [[Al-Masjid al-Nabawi|Mosque of Prophet]] on 18 June 656CE. (25th [[Dhu al-Hijjah]] 35AH.) to choose the caliph. Ali refused to accept caliphate by the fact that the people who pressed him hardest were the rebels, and he therefore declined at first. When the notable companions of Muhammad as well as people who live in Medina urged him, however, he finally agreed.  
According to [[Abu Mekhnaf]]'s narration Talhah was the first prominent companion who gave his pledge but the other narrations claim they didn't do so or even somebody forced them to do so. However he and Al-Zubayr later claimed they did so reluctantly, but Ali refused this claim and said that they did so voluntarily. [[Wilferd Madelung|Mudelong]] believe that force was not used to urge people to give their pledge and they pledged in public in the mosque.&lt;ref&gt;

While the overwhelming majority of people who lived in Medina as well as rebels gave their pledge, some major figures did not. [[Umayyad]]s, kins of Uthman, escaped to [[Levant]] or remained in their houses and later refused Ali's legitimacy. [[Sa`ad ibn Abi Waqqas]] were absent and [[Abdullah ibn Umar]] abstained from offering his allegiance but both of them assured Ali that they wouldn't do anything against Ali.

&lt;/ref&gt; Another prominent figure who was in [[Mecca]] at that time and later opposed Ali, was [[A'isha]], Muhammad's widow.

At the beginning Ali told people that Muslim polity had come to be plagued by dissension and discord and he wanted to purge Islam of all evil from which it had come to suffer. Then warned all concerned that he would tolerate no sedition and all found guilty of subversive activities would be dealt with harshly. He advised people to behave as true Muslims.&lt;ref name="Ashraf 2005, p. 121"&gt;Ashraf (2005), p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

But he soon found that he was helpless and the prisoner of the people who didn't obey him. The caliphate had come to him as the gift of the rebels and he didn't have enough force to control or punish them.&lt;ref name="Ashraf 2005, p. 121" /&gt; When some people asked Ali to punish those who killed Uthman, Ali answered, "How do I have the power for it while those who assaulted him are in the height of their power. They have superiority over us, not we over them."&lt;ref&gt;وَلكِنْ كَيْفَ لي بِقُوَّة وَالْقَوْمُ الْـمُجْلبُونَ عَلَى حَدِّ شَوْكَتِهِمْ، يَمْلِكُونَنَا وَلاَ نَمْلِكُهُمْ
[http://www.nahjulbalagha.org/SermonDetail.php?Sermon=167 Nahj Al-Balagha, sermon 167]&lt;/ref&gt; While [[A'isha]], Talhah, Al-Zubayr and Umayyad especially [[Muawiyah I]] wanted to take revenge for Uthman's death and punish the rioters who had killed him. However some historians believe that they use this issue to seek their political ambitions due to finding Ali's caliphate against their own benefit.&lt;ref name="Iranica" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tabatabae191"&gt;[http://www.balagh.net/english/shia/shia/10.htm#00011 Tabatabae (1979), p. 191] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080329020223/http://www.balagh.net/english/shia/shia/10.htm |date=2008-03-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See:

Soon after Ali became caliph, he dismissed provincial governors who had been appointed by Uthman, and replaced them with trusted aides. He acted against the counsel of [[Mughrah ibn Shobah]] and [[Ibn Abbas]], who had advised him to proceed cautiously. Madelung says Ali was deeply convinced of his right and his religious mission, unwilling to compromise his principles for the sake of political expediencey, ready to fight against overwhelming odds. Muawiyah, kinsman of Uthman and governor of [[Levant]] refused to submit to Ali's orders - the only governor to do this.&lt;ref name="Iranica" /&gt;&lt;ref name="firstfourcaliphs" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See:
* Madelung (1997), pp.148 and 149&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Battle of Bassorah]] Ali transferred his capital from Medina to Kufa, the Muslim garrison city in [[Iraq]]. Kufa was in the middle of Islamic land and had strategic position.&lt;ref name="firstfourcaliphs" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsu.edu:8080/~dee/SHIA/ALI.HTM 'Ali] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080329070652/http://www.wsu.edu:8080/~dee/SHIA/ALI.HTM |date=March 29, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ali resumed the land which had been granted by Uthman and swore to resume whatever some elites had taken before him. He opposed the centralization of capital control over provincial revenues and favored an equal distribution of [[Islamic tax|taxes]] and booty among the Muslims; in contrast to Umar he distributed the entire revenue of the [[divan]] among Muslims without keeping anything in reserve. When asked to pay more money to elites he said "Do you command me that I should seek support by oppressing those over whom I have been placed? By Allah, I won't do so as long as the world goes on, and as long as one star leads another in the sky. Even if it were my property, I would have distributed it equally among them, then why not when the property is that of Allah."&lt;ref name="Iranica" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lapidus (2002), p. 46; [[Nahj al-Balagha]] [http://www.nahjulbalagha.org/sermons.php Sermon 15, 125] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927212719/http://www.nahjulbalagha.org/sermons.php |date=2007-09-27 }}
لمّا عوتب على تصييره الناس أسوة في العطاء من غير تفضيل إلى السابقات والشرف، قال:
أَتَأْمُرُونِّي أَنْ أَطْلُبَ النَّصْرَ بِالْجَوْرِ فِيمَنْ وُلِّيتُ عَلَيْهِ! وَاللهِ لاَ أَطُورُ بِهِ مَا سَمَرَ سَميرٌ، وَمَا أَمَّ نَجْمٌ فِي السَّمَاءِ نَجْماً! لَوْ كَانَ الْمَالُ لي لَسَوَّيْتُ بَيْنَهُمْ، فَكَيْفَ وَإِنَّمَا الْمَالُ مَالُ اللهِ لَهُمْ.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Ali believed that people and governors have rights over each other and God created these rights so as to equate with one another. The greatest of these rights that Allah has made obligatory is the right of the ruler over the ruled and the right of the ruled over the ruler. If the ruled fulfill the rights of the ruler and the ruler fulfills their rights, then right attains the position of honor among them, the ways of religion become established, signs of justice become fixed and the [[sunnah]] gains currency. He wrote directions for his officials which clearly show what form of regime he wanted to introduce. It was not to be a regime whose officers had an upper hand and were fattened on public money. It was to be a regime where the governed and the tax-payers were at premium. It was their convenience for which the State was to function. It was a welfare-state working solely for the welfare of the people living under its rule, a regime where the rich cannot get richer while the poor are made poorer; a regime where canons of religion hold the balance between the governed and the ruler. He asked people not to speak with him as they spoke with cruel governors and be honest with him.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nahj al-Balagha]] [http://www.nahjulbalagha.org/sermons.php Sermon 215] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927212719/http://www.nahjulbalagha.org/sermons.php |date=2007-09-27 }}

Ali had decisive beliefs that he shouldn't start a war with other Muslims but when the enemy started it his army wouldn't retreat unless they wanted to attack again. He ordered his soldiers not to kill who would become injured, or not be able to defend himself, or escape from the battlefield and injuries and wanted his warriors not to injure women.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nahj al-Balagha]] [http://www.nahjulbalagha.org/letters.php Letter 14]&lt;/ref&gt;

==First Fitna==

{{See also|First Fitna}}

The First Fitna, 656&amp;ndash;661 CE, followed the assassination of the caliph Uthman Ibn Affan, continued during the caliphate of Ali, and was ended, on the whole, by Muawiyah's assumption of the caliphate. This civil war is often called the [[Fitna (word)|Fitna]], and regretted as the end of the early unity of the Islamic [[ummah]] (nation). Ali was first opposed by a faction led by Talhah, Al-Zubayr and Muhammad's wife, [[Aisha]] bint Abu Bakr. This group was known as ''disobedients'' (Nakithin) by their enemies. First they gathered in Mecca then moved to [[Basra]] with the expectation of finding the necessary forces and resources to mobilize people in what is now Iraq. The rebels occupied Basra, killing many people. When Ali asked them for obedience and a pledge of allegiance, they refused. The two parties met at the [[Battle of Bassorah]] (Battle of the Camel) in 656, where Ali emerged victorious.&lt;ref&gt;See:

&lt;/ref&gt;

Then he appointed [[Ibn Abbas]] governor of [[Basra]] and moved his capital to [[Kufa]]. Later he was challenged by [[Muawiyah I]], the governor of [[Levant]] and the cousin of [[Uthman]], who refused Ali's demands for allegiance and called for revenge for Uthman. Ali opened negotiations with him with the hope of regaining his allegiance but Muawiyah insisted on Levant autonomy under his rule. Muawiyah replied by mobilizing his [[Levant]]n supporters and refusing to pay homage to Ali on the pretext that his contingent had not participated in his election. The two armies encamped themselves at [[Siffin]] for more than one hundred days, most of the time being spent in negotiations. Although, Ali exchanged several letters with Muawiyah, he was unable to dismiss the latter, nor persuade him to pledge allegiance. Skirmishes between the parties led to the [[Battle of Siffin]] in 657. After a week of combat was followed by a violent battle known as laylat al-harir (the night of clamor) the Muawiyah's army were on the point of being routed when [[Amr ibn al-Aas]] advised Muawiyah to have his soldiers hoist [[mushaf]] (either parchments inscribed with verses of the Qur'an, or complete copies of it) on their spearheads in order to cause disagreement and confusion in Ali's army.&lt;ref name="Iranica" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lapidus (2002), p. 47; Holt (1977a), p. 70 - 72; Tabatabaei (1979), p. 53 - 54; [[Nahj Al-Balagha]] [http://www.nahjulbalagha.org/sermons.php Sermons 43, 54, 56, 67, 68] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927212719/http://www.nahjulbalagha.org/sermons.php |date=2007-09-27 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The two armies finally agreed to settle the matter of who should be Caliph by arbitration. The refusal of the largest bloc in Ali's army to fight was the decisive factor in his acceptance of the arbitration. The question as to whether the arbiter would represent Ali or the [[Kufa]]ns caused a further split in Ali's army. [[Ash'ath ibn Qays]] and some others who later became the [[Kharijites]] rejected Ali's nominees, [[`Abd Allah ibn `Abbas]] and [[Malik al-Ashtar]], and insisted on [[Abu Musa Ash'ari]], who was opposed by Ali, since he had earlier prevented people from supporting him. Ali was urged to accept Abu Musa but he never did.  Those who preferred Abu Musa went decided to continue with the arbitration anyway. The [[Kharijites]] ([[schisma]]tics), later opposed the decision to choose Abu Musa blaming Ali for his appointment and rebelled and Ali had to fight with them in the [[Battle of Nahrawan]]. The arbitration resulted in the dissolution of Ali's coalition and some have opined that this was Muawiyah's intention.&lt;ref name="Iranica" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Madelung (1997), pp. 241 - 259; Lapidus (2002), p. 47; Holt (1977a), pp. 70 - 72; Tabatabaei (1979), pp. 53 - 54; [[Nahj Al-Balagha]] [http://www.nahjulbalagha.org/sermons.php Sermons 40, 58, 59, 78, 121, 124, 126] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927212719/http://www.nahjulbalagha.org/sermons.php |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muawiyah's army invaded and plundered cities, which Ali's governors couldn't prevent and people didn't support him to fight with them. Muawiyah overpowered Egypt, Yemen and other areas.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

This civil war created permanent divisions within the Muslim community and Muslims were divided over who had the legitimate right to occupy the caliphate.&lt;ref&gt;See:

==Death==
[[Image:Sword and shield reproduction from Bab al Nasr gate Cairo Egypt.jpg|thumb|right|[[Zulfiqar]] with and without the shield. The [[Fatimid]] depiction of [[Ali]]'s sword as carved on the Gates of Old Cairo, namely Bab al-Nasr.]]

On the nineteenth of Ramadan, while Ali was praying in the mosque of Kufa, the [[Kharijite]] [[Abd-al-Rahman ibn Muljam]] assassinated him with a strike of his poison-coated sword. Ali, wounded by the poisonous sword, lived for two days and died on the 21st of Ramadan in the city of Kufa in 661 CE.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.balagh.net/english/shia/shia/10.htm#00011 Tabatabae (1979), page 192] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080329020223/http://www.balagh.net/english/shia/shia/10.htm |date=2008-03-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ali ordered his sons not to kill a group of people. Since the act was performed by a single member of Kharijite group and not all of them, they had to revenge just the murderer.&lt;ref&gt;Kelsay (1993), p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; Thus later Hasan fulfilled [[Qisas]] and killed ibn Muljam.&lt;ref&gt;Madelung (1997), p.309&lt;/ref&gt;

In these two days he dictated his will to his household "My advice to you is that you should not consider anyone as a co-worker of the Lord, be firm in your belief that there is One and only One Allah. Do not waste the knowledge given to you by the Muhammad and do not give up and destroy his [[Sunnah]] [traditions]. Keep these two pillars of Islam [monotheism and Sunnah of the Muhammad] aloft. If you act according to my advice then you cannot be blamed for damaging or destroying the religion." 
&lt;ref&gt;وَصِيَّتِي لَكُمْ: أَنْ لاَ تُشْرِكُوا بِاللهِ شَيْئاً، وَمُحَمَّدٌ(صلى الله عليه وآله) فَلاَ تُضَيِّعُوا سُنَّتَهُ، أَقِيمُوا هذَيْنِ الْعَمُودَينِ، وَخَلاَ كُمْ ذَمٌّ

==Burial==
[[File:Mazar-e sharif - Steve Evans.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rawze-e-Sharif]], the Blue Mosque, in [[Mazari Sharif]], [[Afghanistan]] - Where a minority of Muslims believe Ali ibn Abi Talib is buried]]
Because Ali did not want his grave to be desecrated by his enemies, he asked his friends and family members to bury him secretly. This secret gravesite is supposed to have been revealed later during the [[Abbasid]] caliphate by [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]], the sixth Shia Imam.&lt;ref&gt;Majlesi, V.97, p. 246-251&lt;/ref&gt; Most Shi'as accept that Ali was buried at the [[Imam Ali Mosque|Tomb of Imam Ali]] in the [[Imam Ali Mosque]] at what is now the city of [[Najaf]], which grew around the mosque and shrine called Masjid Ali.&lt;ref name="Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib"&gt;{{cite book| last = Redha| first = Mohammad|author2=Mohammad Agha| title = Imam Ali Ibn Abi Taleb (Imam Ali the Fourth Caliph, 1/1 Volume)| publisher = Dar Al Kotob Al ilmiyah| year = 1999| isbn = 2-7451-2532-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However another story, usually maintained by Afghans, notes that his body was taken and buried in the Afghan city of [[Mazari Sharif]] at the famous Blue Mosque or [[Rawze-e-Sharif]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/cities/afghanistan/balkh.html Balkh and Mazar-e-Sharif]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Battle of Los Angeles''' tournament (the BOLA) is an annual [[independent wrestling]] tournament in North America, run and promoted by [[Pro Wrestling Guerrilla]]. Over the years, the tournament has attracted numerous famous independent wrestlers from [[A.J. Styles]] and [[Christopher Daniels]] to [[Bryan Danielson]] and [[Kenny Omega]].

==The tournament setup==
In the first year of the Battle of Los Angeles there were sixteen participants, with eight opening round matches, four quarterfinal matches, two semifinal matches, and a final. In 2006 the tournament was expanded to 24 participants, which caused the addition of another eight person bracket and created three semifinals matches and an elimination three-way final match. In 2008 the tournament returned to its 16-man format. In 2011, the tournament was completely revamped, taking place for the first time as a one night tournament with only eight participants. Since 2014, the tournament has reverted to a 24-man format held over three nights. The first two nights are all first-round matches, while the third night contains the quarter- and semi-finals before culminating in a three-way match for the championship. All nights also feature non-tournament special attractions, which are usually tag-team matches involving tournament participants from other nights or eliminated wrestlers.

On October 16 PWG announced that 17 participants will be in the tournament, this occurred because the two PWG commissioners ([[Excalibur (wrestler)|Excalibur]] and Dino Winwood) couldn't come to a conclusion on who would be the final entrant, which led to one first round match being a three-way dance.

The '''Battle of Peonnum''' was fought about AD 660 between the [[Wessex|West Saxons]] under [[Cenwalh of Wessex|Cenwalh]] and the [[Britons (historical)|Britons]] of what is now [[Somerset]] in [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;"Allowing again for the slight chronological inaccuracy of the Chronicle across these years, this event may he dated c. 660. The annal implies that by this date Cenwealh dominated the Saxons of Wiltshire and beyond." Kirby, D. B. ''The Earliest English Kings'' Routledge; Revised Edition (30 April 2000) {{ISBN|978-0-415-24211-0}} p.47&lt;/ref&gt; It was a decisive victory for the Saxons, who gained control of Somerset as far west as the [[River Parrett]]. The location of the battle is uncertain.

==Saxon conquest==
The border between the [[Wessex|West Saxons]] and the [[Britons (historical)|Britons]] of Somerset had been set at the [[Wansdyke (earthwork)|Wansdyke]] along the ridge of the [[Mendip Hills]] following the [[Battle of Deorham]] and the Saxon occupation of [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] in 577.&lt;ref name=Major44&gt;Major, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in 652, [[Cenwalh of Wessex|Cenwalh]] broke through at the Battle of [[Bradford on Avon]].&lt;ref name=Major44/&gt;

Relief for the Britons came when Cenwalh was exiled to [[East Anglia]] after a squabble with [[Penda of Mercia]].&lt;ref&gt;Bede, ''Ecclesiastical History of the English People'', Book III, chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Some time after his return he renewed the attack on the British tribes and in 658 his army met the Britons for a climactic battle at Peonnum. The Saxons were victorious, and Cenwalh advanced west through the [[Polden Hills]] to the [[River Parrett]], annexing eastern and central Somerset. The territory gained was modest in size; [[Geoffrey Ashe]] suggests that Cenwalh's ultimate goal may have been gaining control over the valuable [[Glastonbury Abbey]] within it.&lt;ref name=Ashe279&gt;Ashe, p. 279&lt;/ref&gt;

The border remained at the Parrett until 681–685, when [[Centwine of Wessex]] defeated King [[Cadwaladr]] of [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|Gwynedd]] and his local allies, allowing them to occupy the rest of Somerset west and north to the [[Bristol Channel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://britishbattles.homestead.com/britishisles.html|title=War Tourist|publisher=British Battles|accessdate=27 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; West Saxon rule was consolidated and extended into [[Devon]] by King [[Ine of Wessex|Ina]].&lt;ref name="VCH"&gt;''The Victoria History of the County of Somerset'', Vol 1 (1906)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
The battle is said to have happened ''æt peonnum'', which means "at the ''penns''". ''Penn'' is the [[Brythonic languages|Brittonic Celtic]] word for "head" or "top",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mabinogion.info/HeadOfAnnwfn.htm|title=The Head of Annwfn|publisher=The Mabinogion and the Mabinogi |accessdate=27 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which here is likely used for "hill" or "peak". Suggested locations include [[Penselwood]] (''Pen Selwood''), near [[Wincanton]] which is called ''Penna'' in the [[Domesday Book]],&lt;ref name="EWW"&gt;Major, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pinhoe]] or Pen Beacon in Devon, and Penn (near [[Yeovil]]).&lt;ref&gt;Yorke, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;
Note that the highest point of the Mendip Hills is named Pen Hill.

'''Broadcast.com''' was an [[Internet radio]] company founded as '''AudioNet''' in September 1995 by Christopher Jaeb. [[Todd Wagner]] and [[Mark Cuban]] later led the organization and eventually sold to [[Yahoo!]] on April 1, 1999 for $5.7 billion, making it the [[list of mergers and acquisitions by Yahoo!|most expensive acquisition]] Yahoo! has made.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/pictures/eeji45ejede/1-broadcast-com/#5536a7143d62 Forbes: Broadcast.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The service has since been discontinued.

==History==
The company was founded in 1989 as Cameron Audio Networks, named after its founder Cameron Christopher Jaeb, who received an initial investment from his father.&lt;ref name=unknownfounder/&gt; Jaeb wanted a method for people to be able to listen to out of town sports games. The original idea, a [[shortwave radio]] that would receive broadcasts inside a sports venue, morphed into a hand-held device that would receive customized satellite broadcasts.&lt;ref name=unknownfounder&gt;{{cite web | url=https://mixergy.com/interviews/chris-jaeb-broadcast-interview/ | title=The Unknown Founder Who Got 10% of Broadcast.com | publisher=Mixergy | date=September 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the support of his father Tom Jaeb, he incorporated.&lt;ref name=unknownfounder/&gt;

Jaeb then began soliciting the rights to broadcast radio and professional sports games live on the Internet, making 80-100 calls per day.&lt;ref name=unknownfounder/&gt;

In 1994, through a class that his girlfriend was taking, Jaeb was introduced to Todd Wagner, an attorney at [[Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld]].&lt;ref name=unknownfounder/&gt; Wagner introduced Jaeb to [[Mark Cuban]], who invested $10,000 in exchange for 2% of the company.&lt;ref name=unknownfounder/&gt; Cuban wanted to listen to the basketball games of his [[alma mater]], [[Indiana University]].&lt;ref name=newmedia&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z8RhVp7B5uAC | title=Understanding New Media | first=Robert K. | last=Logan | publisher=Peter Lang | year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuban and Wagner worked out a deal whereby Jaeb would keep 10% of the company and would get a monthly salary of $2,500 but Cuban would take control of the company.&lt;ref name=unknownfounder/&gt; The company was renamed AudioNet.com in September 1995 in conjunction with the reorganization. At first Cuban picked up signals from [[KLIF (AM)]] in his bedroom and then streamed them on the internet.&lt;ref name=newmedia/&gt; The company grew from mainly broadcasting sporting events to broadcasting [[U.S. presidential nominating convention]]s and many other events.&lt;ref name=newmedia/&gt;

In 1998, AudioNet was renamed to Broadcast.com and in July 1998, the company became a [[public company]] via an initial public offering.&lt;ref name=bangup&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.cnet.com/news/broadcast-coms-bang-up-ipo/ | title=Broadcast.com's bang-up IPO | publisher=[[CNET]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stock price soared 250% on its first day of trading, a record for a newly issued public stock.&lt;ref name=bangup/&gt;&lt;ref name=frenzy&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/18/business/broadcastcom-soars-in-an-opening-day-frenzy.html | title=Broadcast.com Soars in an Opening-Day Frenzy | first=DAVID | last=BARBOZA | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=July 18, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the IPO, the company was worth $1 billion, Mark Cuban was worth $300 million,  and Todd Wagner was worth $170 million.&lt;ref name=frenzy/&gt;

On April 1, 1999, less than 9 months after the IPO, [[Yahoo!]] announced the acquisition of broadcast.com for $5.7 billion in stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://money.cnn.com/1999/04/01/deals/yahoo/ | title=Yahoo! buying BCST.com | publisher=[[CNN Money]] | date=April 1, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, broadcast.com had 570,000 users, and the purchase price was $10,000 per user. Cuban sold most of his Yahoo stock that same year, netting over $1 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.salon.com/2016/07/25/yahoos_evolution_from_rising_to_fading_internet_star/ | title=Yahoo’s evolution from rising to fading internet star | work=[[Associated Press]] | publisher=[[Salon.com]] | date=July 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founder Chris Jaeb, whose stake was diluted to less than 1% of the company, received approximately $50 million from the sale.&lt;ref name=unknownfounder/&gt;

The service became a part of Yahoo! Broadcast Services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.fastcompany.com/61848/broadcastcom-now-yahoo-broadcast-services | title=Broadcast.com Now Yahoo Broadcast Services | first=JULIE | last=PIOTROWSKI | publisher=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]] | date=November 30, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yahoo shut down much of its broadcast services in 2002&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1025052018485386440 | title=Yahoo Plans to Shut Down Some Broadcast Services | first1=Nick | last1=Wingfield | first2=Anna Wilde | last2=Mathews | publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | date=June 26, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and broadcast.com has since been discontinued.

'''''Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth''''', 524 US 742 (1998) is a landmark employment law case of the [[United States Supreme Court]] holding that employers are liable if supervisors create a [[hostile work environment]] for employees. ''Ellerth'' also introduced a two-part affirmative defense allowing employers to avoid sex discrimination liability if they follow best practices. ''Ellerth'' is often considered alongside [[Faragher v. City of Boca Raton|''Faragher'']].

==Facts==
Kimberly Ellerth, a female employee at [[Burlington Industries]], sued the company for [[sexual harassment]] on the part of her male supervisor. She alleged the vice president of sales made offensive remarks and unwanted overtures. She identified three episodes involving threats to deny tangible job benefits unless sexual favors were granted. She alleged a violation of title VII of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. The lower court dismissed her claim, noting that she had suffered no actual negative job consequences. The [[Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals]] reversed the lower court decision, but issued 8 separate opinions. 

==Burlington Industries Defense==
Ellerth is most referenced for its two-part [[affirmative defense]] for supervisor sexual harassment. In the case, a supervisor is defined by the ability to take a Tangible Employment Action. A Tangible Employment Action makes the company vicariously liable because the agency relationship was used to take the action. In alleged sex discrimination cases without a Tangible Employment Action, employers may prove that: 

# the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior, and that 
# the employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventative or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise. 

Generally, having an effective sexual harassment policy that is used and works is sufficient to satisfy the first prong. Further cases (see ''[[EEOC v. Racine]]'') examine whether an employee's failure to take advantage of the policy was unreasonable, but ''Ellerth'' holds that when the policy requires reporting to a harasser, it is not unreasonable to fail to do so. (Ellerth would have been required to report to her harasser.)

==Judgment==
In a 7–2 decision, the Supreme Court ruled in her favor. Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]] said that Congress had left it to the courts to determine the controlling principles. This majority ruling was summarized as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Under Title VII, an employee who refuses the unwelcome and threatening sexual advances  of a supervisor, yet suffers no adverse, tangible job consequences, may recover against the employer without showing the employer is negligent or otherwise at fault for the supervisor's actions, but the employer may interpose an affirmative defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kathryn Cullen-DuPont|title=Encyclopedia of Women's History in America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oIro7MtiFuYC&amp;pg=PA39|year=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|pages=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Justice Kennedy wrote the majority opinion, joined by [[William Renquist|Chief Justice Rehnquist]], [[John Paul Stevens|Justice Stevens]], [[Sandra Day O'Connor|Justice O'Connor]], [[David Souter|Justice Souter]], and [[Stephen Breyer|Justice Breyer]]. [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg|Justice Ginsburg]] wrote a concurring opinion. 

[[Clarence Thomas|Justice Thomas]] wrote a dissenting opinion, joined by [[Antonin Scalia|Justice Scalia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.oyez.org/cases/1990-1999/1997/1997_97_569 | title=BURLINGTON INDUSTRIES, INC. v. ELLERTH | accessdate=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
Gauri Shankar ([[Jagapathi Babu]]) is a circle inspector of Punjagutta and is known as a heavy corrupt police officer. Rangarao ([[Jeeva (Telugu actor)|Jeeva]]) is his assistant and his daughter Sindhu ([[Vimala Raman]]) is an aerobics, teacher. Once, two sons of a big industrialist (Prasad Babu) kill two girls for not accepting their love by pouring acid on them. Soon, the two get killed by some unidentified person in the same fashion. The industrialist uses his political influence and gets the case investigated by the CB-CID. The police commissioner ([[Chalapathi Rao]]) calls Gowri and tells him to hand over all the evidence to the CB-CID officer, SP Sarath Chandra ([[Murali Sharma]]). Even as the CID officer is investigating, another two persons get murdered in the same fashion. The CID officer makes an in-depth study into the case and finally comes to the conclusion that it is Gowri, who is behind these murders. At this juncture, Gowri leaves for Mumbai and kills some gangsters who were kidnapping and selling young girls and exporting them to other countries.

In English law, causing '''criminal damage''' was originally a [[common law]] [[Crime|offence]]. The offence was largely concerned with the protection of dwellings and the food supply, and few sanctions were imposed for damaging personal property. Liability was originally restricted to the payment of damages by way of compensation.

As time passed, specific laws were introduced to deal with particular situations as they were judged to require intervention, most particularly alongside the rise of mechanisation and urbanisation during the [[Industrial Revolution]].

The modern law of criminal damage is mostly contained in the Criminal Damage Act 1971, which redefines or creates several offences protecting property rights. The Act provides a comprehensive structure covering merely preparatory acts to the most serious offences of [[arson]] and causing damage with intent to endanger life. As such, punishments vary from a [[Fixed Penalty Notice|fixed penalty]] to [[life imprisonment]], and the court may order payment of compensation to a victim.

==History==

===Common law===
[[File:FrameBreaking-1812.jpg|thumb|A contemporary engraving of [[Luddite|machine-breaking]] textile workers]]

The common law generally treated damage to another's chattels as a civil matter leading only to a right to damages in [[trespass]] or [[nuisance]]; in the 18th century, [[William Blackstone|Blackstone]] stated: "The rights of personal property in possession are liable to two species of injuries: the amotion [carrying away]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Amotion|url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Amotion|publisher=The Free Dictionary|year=2008|accessdate=2008-03-10}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or deprivation of that possession; and the abuse or damage of the chattels, while the possession continues in the legal owner."&lt;ref name="Blackstone"&gt;{{citation|author=[[William Blackstone]]|chapter=Of Injuries to Personal Property &amp;#91;Book the Third, Chapter the Ninth&amp;#93;|chapter-url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/blackstone/bk3ch9.htm|title=[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]|location=Oxford|publisher=[[Oxford University Press|Clarendon Press]] (reproduced at The Avalon Project at [[Yale Law School]])|year=1765–1769|accessdate=2008-06-01}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Blackstone clearly labelled these as "Private Wrongs" in his commentaries, emphasising that property rights were enforced ''[[inter partes]]'', and that the State was not necessarily one of the involved parties.&lt;ref name="Blackstone"/&gt; In fact, the criminal law only intervened in the case of [[arson]], defining it as "the malicious and wilful burning of the house or outhouses of another man". This protection extended to barns and even "stacks of corn". Arson traditionally attracted the [[death penalty]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=[[William Blackstone]]|chapter=Of Offenses against the Habitations of Individuals &amp;#91;Book the Fourth, Chapter the Sixteenth&amp;#93;|chapter-url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/blackstone/bk4ch16.htm|title=[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]|location=Oxford|publisher=[[Oxford University Press|Clarendon Press]] (reproduced on The Avalon Project at [[Yale Law School]])|year=1765–1769|accessdate=2008-06-01}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and had done so in [[Roman law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Adolf Berger|title=Encyclopedic Dictionary of Roman Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oR0LAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA497&amp;lpg=PA497&amp;dq=arson+%22roman+law%22+%22death+penalty%22|location=Philadelphia, Pa.|publisher=[[American Philosophical Society]]|year=1953|isbn=1-58477-142-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early legislation===
Whereas the common law protected habitation and sources of wealth and food in a largely agricultural society, the [[Industrial Revolution]], especially the [[Luddite|Luddism]] resulting from workers' perceived threats to their livelihood, required new legislation to match the circumstances. The reaction of Parliament to Luddism was to criminalise ''machine-breaking'' – the destruction of textile-making machinery – as early as 1721.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Marjorie Bloy|title=The Age of George III|url=http://www.historyhome.co.uk/c-eight/distress/luddites.htm|publisher=A Web of English History|accessdate=2008-06-01}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the punishment was [[penal transportation|transportation to the Colonies]] but as a result of continued opposition to mechanisation the [[Destruction of Stocking Frames, etc. Act 1812|Frame-Breaking Act]] of 1812 made the [[death penalty]] available.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Karly Walters |title=Law, "Terror", and the Frame-Breaking Act |url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:rj4mt_3yjmkJ:www.ehs.org.uk/ehs/conference2004/assets/walters.doc |publisher=Economic History Society |year=2004 |accessdate=2008-06-01 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consolidation===

A number of statutory provisions creating offences of damaging specific types of property were consolidated by 7 &amp; 8 Geo.4 c.30 (1827) (Malicious injuries to property) which was one of [[Peel's Acts]]. This Act and a number of subsequent statutes were consolidated by the [[Malicious Damage Act 1861]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Malicious Damage Act 1861==

{{main|Malicious Damage Act 1861}}
{{see also|Criminal law consolidation Acts 1861}}

'''The Malicious Damage Act 1861'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/RevisedStatutes/Acts/ukpga/1861/cukpga_18610097_en_1 Malicious Damage Act 1861] ([[List of Acts of Parliament of the United Kingdom Parliament, 1860-1879#1861 (24 &amp; 25 Vict)|24 &amp; 25 Vict. c. 97]]).&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Victorian era|Victorian]] consolidation statute which set out detailed protections of property, most of which have now been superseded by the Criminal Damage Act 1971. The remaining provisions applicable in England and Wales are:

*[[Malicious Damage Act 1861#Section 35 - Placing wood, &amp;c. on railway, with intent to obstruct or overthrow any engine, &amp;c.|Section 35 - Placing wood, &amp;c. on railway, with intent to obstruct or overthrow any engine, &amp;c.]]
*[[Malicious Damage Act 1861#Section 36 - Obstructing engines or carriages on railways|Section 36 - Obstructing engines or carriages on railways]]
*[[Malicious Damage Act 1861#Other matters|Section 58 - Malice against owner of property unnecessary]]
*[[Malicious Damage Act 1861#Other matters|Section 72 - Offences committed within the jurisdiction of the Admiralty]]

==Criminal Damage Act 1971==

===Definition===
Whereas the 1861 Act protected in detail many different types of property, the Criminal Damage Act 1971&lt;ref name="cd1971"&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1971/pdf/ukpga_19710048_en.pdf Criminal Damage Act 1971] ([[List of Acts of Parliament of the United Kingdom Parliament, 1960-1979#1971|1971 c. 48]]).&lt;/ref&gt; provided a definition wide enough to apply to any tangible property. By section 1(1) of the Act:

{{quote|A person who without lawful excuse destroys or damages any property belonging to another intending to destroy or damage any such property or being reckless as to whether any such property would be destroyed or damaged shall be guilty of an offence.}}

===="Without lawful excuse"====
Apart from the general [[Right of self-defense|self-defence]] excuse applicable to any offence involving violent acts, section 5 of the Act sets out specific provisions in relation to criminal damage: a defendant will have "lawful excuse" if

:(a) at the time ... he believed that the person ... believed to be entitled to consent to the destruction or damage ... had so consented, or would have consented had they known ..., or
:(b) he destroyed or damaged ... the property in question ... in order to protect property ... and at the time ... he believed—
::(i) that the property ... was in immediate need of protection; and
::(ii) that the means of protection ... were ... reasonable having regard to all the circumstances.&lt;ref name="cd1971"/&gt;

Section 5(3) of the Act states that it is immaterial whether the defendant's belief is justified as long as it is an honest belief, and therefore creates a subjective test to be assessed by the court or jury. In ''Chamberlain v. Lindon'' (1998),&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/1998/329.html Chamberlain v. Lindon]'' [1989] EWHC 329.&lt;/ref&gt; Lindon demolished a wall to protect a [[Rights of way in England and Wales|right of way]], honestly believing that it was a reasonable means of avoiding litigation. It was said that:

{{quote|In the criminal context the question is not whether the means of protection adopted by the respondent were objectively reasonable, having regard to all the circumstances, but whether the respondent believed them to be so, and by virtue of section 5(3) it is immaterial whether his belief was justified, provided it was honestly held.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/1998/329.html#para50 Chamberlain v. Lindon] per'' Sullivan J. at para. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, in ''[[R v Hill and Hall]]'' (1989),&lt;ref&gt;''R v. Hill and Hall'' [1989] 89 [[Criminal Appeal Reports|Cr. App. Rep.]] 74.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] introduced an objective element to part (b) of the defence. The defendants had been convicted of possession of a hacksaw blade outside a US naval base in Wales, having admitted an intention to use the blade to cut through the base's perimeter fence. They claimed a lawful excuse in that they had acted to protect their own property located near the base; their reasoning was that the base would at some point in the future attract a nuclear attack by the [[Soviet Union]]. Given that Hill was "forced to admit that she did not expect a nuclear bomb to fall today or tomorrow",&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Tony Storey|author2=Alan Lidbury|title=Criminal Law|edition=3rd|location=Cullompton, Devon|publisher=Willan|year=2004|page=204|isbn=1-84392-100-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the Court concluded that this threat to property was too remote and thus the defence had not been made out, however honest the belief had been.

The case of ''[[Jaggard v Dickinson]]'' (1980)&lt;ref&gt;''[[Jaggard v Dickinson]]'' [1980] 3 [[All England Law Reports|All E.R.]] 716.&lt;/ref&gt; held that even a drunken belief will support the defence even though this allows [[Intoxication defense|drunkenness]] to negate basic intent; and ''[[Lloyd v DPP]]'' (1992)&lt;ref&gt;''Lloyd v. DPP'' [1992] 1 All E.R. 982.&lt;/ref&gt; ruled that a motorist who damages a wheel clamp to free his car, having parked on another's property knowing of the risk of being clamped, does not have a lawful excuse under the Act even if he makes a [[mistake of law]].

The courts have said that a defendant relying upon lawful excuse as a defence need not necessarily seek to put himself within section 5. In ''[[R v Denton]]'' (1981),&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/1981/4.html R v. Denton]'' [1981] EWCA 4.&lt;/ref&gt; the defendant had been asked by his employer to set fire to the employer's factory to facilitate an insurance claim. Despite this, it was held that the owner of the factory was entitled to have it burned down – as the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]] put it, "[i]t is not an offence for a man to set light to his own ... property" – and therefore Denton, knowing this, had a lawful excuse independent of section 5.

===="Destroys or damages"====
[[File:DamagedBicycle.jpg|thumb|The front wheel of this bicycle has arguably been "destroyed", but the bicycle itself has not been destroyed since the wheel could be replaced. However, as a whole, the bicycle has clearly been "damaged".]]

Whether destruction or damage has occurred is an issue of fact and degree in each case and case law suggests that damage must be more than ''[[de minimis]]''. In ''[[A (a juvenile) v R]]'' (1978),&lt;ref&gt;''A (a juvenile) v. R'' [1978] [[Criminal Law Review|Crim. L.R.]] 689.&lt;/ref&gt; the defendant spat on a police officer's raincoat, which was easily wiped clean; it was held that this did not amount to damage within the 1971 Act. Similarly, in ''[[Morphitis v Salmon]]'' (1990),&lt;ref&gt;Digested as ''Morphitis v. Salmon'' [1990] Crim. L.R. 48, [[Queen's Bench|Q.B.D]].&lt;/ref&gt; a scratch to a scaffolding pole did not affect its value or usefulness and thus damage had not been proved. The court said:

{{quote|The authorities show that the term "damage" for the purpose of this provision, should be widely interpreted so as to conclude not only permanent or temporary physical harm, but also permanent or temporary impairment of value or usefulness.&lt;ref&gt;''Morphitis v. Salmon per'' [[Robin Auld|Auld]] [[High Court judge (England and Wales)|J.]], transcript of unreported judgment cited in ''[[R v Whiteley]]'' (1991) 93 Cr. App. R. 25 at 29. See also the digest [1978] Crim. L.R. 48 at 49.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A different conclusion was reached in ''[[Hardman v Chief Constable of Avon and Somerset Constabulary]]'' (1986),&lt;ref&gt;''Hardman v. Chief Constable of Avon and Somerset Constabulary'' [1986] Crim. L.R. 330.&lt;/ref&gt; where graffiti, although eventually removable by action of rainfall, was actually washed away by the [[Local government in England|local authority]], incurring expense, was held to be criminal damage.

It is sufficient that any damage be merely temporary: in ''[[Cox v Riley]]'' (1986),&lt;ref&gt;''Cox v. Riley'' [1986] 83 Cr. App. R. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; the deletion of the program from a computer-controlled machine, rendering it unusable, was held to constitute damage. This decision was followed in ''R v. Whiteley'' (1991) in relation to [[Hacker (computer security)|computer hacking]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title= Principles of Criminal Law|last= Bloy|first= Duncan|author2= Denis Lanser|author3=Philip Parry|year= 2000|publisher= Routledge-Cavendish|isbn= 978-1-85941-580-1|page=382 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-T0HM4CdArUC&amp;pg=PA384&amp;lpg=PA384&amp;dq=WHiteley+%22criminal+damage%22&amp;q=WHiteley%20%22criminal%20damage%22|accessdate=2010-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; although that conduct is now dealt with under the [[Computer Misuse Act 1990]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1990/Ukpga_19900018_en_1.htm Computer Misuse Act 1990] ([[List of Acts of Parliament of the United Kingdom Parliament, 1980-1999#1990|1990 c. 18]]).&lt;/ref&gt; In that case it was said that:

{{quote|Any alteration to the physical nature of the property concerned may amount to damage within the meaning of the section. Whether it does so or not will depend on the effect that the alteration has had upon the legitimate operator (who for convenience may be referred to as the owner) ... where ... the interference ... amounts to an impairment of the value or usefulness of the [property] to the owner, then the necessary damage is established.&lt;ref&gt;''R v Whiteley'', at 29 ''per'' [[Geoffrey Lane, Baron Lane|Lord Lane]] [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|C.J.]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''[[R v Fiak]]'' (2005),&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2005/2381.html R v. Fiak]'' [2005] EWCA 2381.&lt;/ref&gt; the defendant used a clean blanket to block the toilet of the police cell he was occupying, causing the water to overflow and flood his and other cells. The defence argued that clean water had flooded on to a waterproof floor, and that in the process the blanket was soaked by clean water. The blanket would have been reusable when dry. Cleaning up a wet cell floor did not constitute damage to the cell itself. The Court of Appeal noted that this argument assumed the absence of any possible contamination or infection from the lavatory itself, and held that while it is true that the effect of the appellant's actions in relation to the blanket and the cell were both remediable, the simple reality was that the blanket could not be used as a blanket by any other prisoner until it had been dried out and cleaned. Further, the flooded cells remained out of action until the water had been cleared. Thus, both had sustained damage, albeit temporary.

===="Property"====
The definition of property in the 1971 Act differs slightly from the [[Theft Act 1968]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1968/pdf/ukpga_19680060_en.pdf Theft Act 1968] ([[List of Acts of Parliament of the United Kingdom Parliament, 1960-1979#1968|1968 c. 60]]).&lt;/ref&gt; in that it only includes "property of a tangible nature".&lt;ref&gt;Section 10 of the Act.&lt;/ref&gt; Land can be damaged, as in ''Henderson and Batley'' (1984),&lt;ref&gt;1984, unreported, [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|C.A.]], cited in ''R v. Whiteley'' (1991) 93 Cr. App. Rep. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; where the defendants had dumped rubble on a development site which cost a substantial sum to clear; it was held that this constituted damage to the land.

===="Belonging to another"====
Section 10(2) of the Act specifies that property shall be regarded as belonging to any person —

:(a) having the custody or control of it;
:(b) having in it any proprietary right or interest (not being an equitable interest arising only from an agreement to transfer or grant an interest); or
:(c) having a charge on it.

These provisions are similar to those set out in section 5 of the Theft Act 1968 in relation to [[theft]]. It is clearly a right of property ownership to deal with property as one wishes, including its damage or destruction. However a person setting fire to his own house which is subject to a [[mortgage loan|mortgage]] can be charged because the mortgagee will have a proprietary right or interest in the property.&lt;ref&gt;There will arise "a right to the purchase-money, a [[equitable charge|charge]] or [[lien]] on the [[estate (law)|estate]] for the security of that purchase-money, and a right to retain possession of the estate until the purchase-money is paid", ''per'' [[George Jessel (jurist)|Lord Jessel]] [[Master of the Rolls|M.R.]] in ''Lysaght v. Edwards'' (1876) 2 Ch. D. 499.&lt;/ref&gt; Property that is abandoned has no owner, and cannot be stolen;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/theft_acts_incorporating_the_charging_standard/index.html |title=Theft Acts, Incorporating the Charging Standard: Legal Guidance: The Crown Prosecution Service |publisher=[[Crown Prosecution Service]] |accessdate=2009-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; it follows that such property cannot be the subject of a charge of criminal damage.

====Intent and recklessness====
The ''[[mens rea]]'' of all offences in the Act is [[Intention (criminal law)#Direct and oblique intent|direct or oblique intention]], or subjective [[recklessness (law)|recklessness]] as defined by the [[House of Lords]] in ''[[R v G]]'' (2003).&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2003/50.html R v. G]'' [2003] UKHL 50.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Bingham, Baron Bingham of Cornhill|Bingham]] [[Lord Justice of Appeal|L.J.]] stated that a person acts "recklessly" with respect to

:(i) a circumstance when he is aware of a risk that it exists or will exist; or
:(ii) a result when he is aware of a risk that it will occur;

and it is, in the circumstances known to him, unreasonable to take the risk.&lt;ref&gt;''R v. G'', at para. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Booth v. Crown Prosecution Service'' (2006)&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2006/192.html Booth v. Crown Prosecution Service]'' [2006] EWHC 192.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Divisional Court]] upheld the defendant pedestrian's conviction on a charge that, by rashly dashing into the road, he recklessly damaged the vehicle that hit him because "the appellant was aware of the risk and closed his mind to it".

===Aggravated criminal damage===
Section 1(2) of the Act creates an offence which includes all the elements of the section 1(1) offence with an additional element of intending or being reckless as to the endangering of life. The offence lies in possible effects of the defendant's actions and it is not therefore necessary to prove an actual danger to life. However, there must be a connection between the damage and the mental state of the defendant. In ''[[R v Steer]]'' (1986),&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1986/6.html R v. Steer]'' [1986] UKHL 6.&lt;/ref&gt; the defendant fired a gun intending to injure another person, but missed and hit a window instead; it was held that although the intention to endanger life and the fact of damage coexisted, the damage itself did not endanger life. This approach was extended in ''[[R v Webster]]'' (1995),&lt;ref&gt;''R v. Webster'' [1995] 2 All E.R. 168, C.A.&lt;/ref&gt; in which the relationship between the damage ''caused'' and the damage ''intended'' was explored. That case involved the throwing of heavy items into the paths of moving vehicles, and it was held that a defendant may be guilty if he intends to endanger life by the actual damage intended, or is reckless that life will be endangered by that damage. Therefore, although a defendant does not necessarily intend to endanger life when he intends to break a car window, ignoring the likely risk that this will cause the driver to swerve into the path of another vehicle, perhaps fatally, constitutes recklessness and is a sufficient causative nexus.

====Attempts====
Proof of specific intent to endanger life is unnecessary on a charge of attempting this offence. In ''Attorney General's Reference No. 3 of 1992'' (1994),&lt;ref&gt;''Attorney General's Reference No. 3 of 1992'' [1993] 2 All E.R. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; on a charge of attempted aggravated arson, it was held to be sufficient for the prosecution to establish a specific intent to cause damage by fire and that the defendant was reckless as to whether life would thereby be endangered.

===Arson===
{{seealso|Arson#England and Wales, and Hong Kong{{!}}Arson § England and Wales, and Hong Kong}}
Section 1(3) of the 1971 Act specifies that offences under section 1, where the destruction or damage is caused by fire, shall be charged as [[arson]]. It would seem that courts adopt a purposive view in relation to the lawful excuse defence in relation to arson, as in ''[[R v Hunt]]'' (1977).&lt;ref&gt;''[[R v Hunt]]'' (1977) 66 Cr. App. R. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; The defendant, wishing to highlight the lack of fire defences in an old people's home, set fire to it to demonstrate the risks. He claimed an honest belief in that by doing this, he had a lawful excuse within section 5(2). It was held, however, that he had not actually been acting so as to protect property. Although the court assumed that his belief was honest, it ruled that his intention was to draw attention to faulty fire defences rather than to defend the property itself.

===Threats===
Section 2 provides that a person threatening another, with the intent that the other
would fear the threat would be carried out

:(a) to destroy or damage any property belonging to that other or a third person; or
:(b) to destroy or damage his own property in a way which he knows is likely to endanger the life of that other or a third person;

shall be guilty of an offence.

===Possession of items===
Section 3 provides that a person who has anything in his custody or under his control intending without lawful excuse to use it or cause or permit another to use it

:(a) to destroy or damage any property belonging to some other person; or
:(b) to destroy or damage his own or the user’s property in a way which he knows is likely to endanger the life of some other person;

shall be guilty of an offence.

As to the [[mens rea]] for an offence under section 3(a), see ''[[R v Buckingham]]'', 63 Cr App R 159, CA.

===Extent, penalties and procedure===
The 1971 Act applies in England and Wales, and also to [[Northern Ireland]] by the Criminal Damage (Northern Ireland) Order 1977.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/RevisedStatutes/Acts/nisi/1977/cnisi_19770426_en_1 Criminal Damage (Northern Ireland) Order 1977] ([[List of Statutory Instruments of the United Kingdom, 1977#401-500|S.I. 1977 No. 426 (N.I. 4)]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain types of minor damage, such as graffiti, may be dealt with by the issue of [[fixed penalty notice]]s as an alternative to prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Tackling vandalism|url=http://www.crimereduction.homeoffice.gov.uk/vandalism01.htm|publisher=[[Home Office]]|date=2006-11-16|accessdate=2008-06-02}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-aggravated offences involving damage valued at less than [[Pound sterling|£]]5,000 are triable only summarily by [[magistrates]] and the maximum sentence is three months' imprisonment and a fine of £2,500. If the value of the property damaged exceeds £5,000, the defendant is entitled to claim trial on [[indictment]] by a jury, but if tried summarily, may be sentenced to up to six months in jail and a £5,000 fine. Where the value of the property is unclear, the court may hear representations as to value, but may also offer the defendant the option of summary trial, with limited penalties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1980/pdf/ukpga_19800043_en.pdf Magistrates' Courts Act 1980] ([[List of Acts of Parliament of the United Kingdom Parliament, 1980-1999#1980|1980 c. 43]]), section 22. See also "[[Magistrates' Courts Act 1980]]".&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 4 of the 1971 Act sets out that offences under sections 1(2) and 1(3) are punishable by a maximum term of life imprisonment and all others by a maximum of ten years' imprisonment. Section 30 of the [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1998/ukpga_19980037_en_1 Crime and Disorder Act 1998] ([[List of Acts of Parliament of the United Kingdom Parliament, 1980-1999#1998|1998 c. 37]]).&lt;/ref&gt; sets out a higher maximum of 14 years' imprisonment for racially or religiously aggravated offences other than those already carrying a maximum of life imprisonment.

Courts are empowered by sections 130 to 133 of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2000/ukpga_20000006_en_1 Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080607045055/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2000/ukpga_20000006_en_1 |date=June 7, 2008 }} ([[List of Acts of Parliament of the United Kingdom Parliament, 2000-Present#2000|2000 c. 6]]).&lt;/ref&gt; to order payment of compensation by a convicted defendant. The limit is £5,000 per offence in a [[magistrates' court (England and Wales)|magistrates' court]]; the powers of the [[Crown Court]] are unlimited.

The Criminal Damage Act 1971 [[repeal]]ed the [[Dockyards, etc. Protection Act 1772]],&lt;ref&gt;Dockyards, etc. Protection Act 1772 ([[List of Acts of Parliament of the Great Britain Parliament, 1760-1779#12 Geo. III|12 Geo. III c. 24]]).&lt;/ref&gt; which created the [[Capital punishment|capital offences]] commonly known collectively as "[[arson in royal dockyards]]"; these had been overlooked when the death penalty for murder was abolished in 1965.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4924">A '''critical system''' is a system which must be highly reliable and retain this [[Reliability engineering|reliability]] as they evolve without incurring prohibitive costs.&lt;ref name=lorcan&gt;{{cite journal | first1 = Mike | last1 = Hinchey | first2 = Lorcan | last2 = Coyle | url= https://ulir.ul.ie/bitstream/handle/10344/2085/2010_Hinchey,M.pdf?sequence=2 | title = Evolving Critical Systems: a Research Agenda for Computer-Based Systems | pages = 430-435| year = 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four types of critical systems: [[safety critical]], [[mission critical]], [[business critical]] and [[security critical]].&lt;ref name=lorcan /&gt;

==General description==

For such systems, trusted methods and techniques must be used for development. Consequently, critical systems are usually developed using well-tested techniques rather than newer techniques that have not been subject to extensive practical experience. Developers of critical systems are naturally conservative, preferring to use older techniques whose strengths and weaknesses are understood, rather than new techniques which may appear to be better, but whose long-term problems are unknown.&lt;ref name=s2007 /&gt;

Expensive software engineering techniques that are not cost-effective for non-critical systems may sometimes be used for critical systems development. For example, [[Formal methods|formal mathematical methods]] of software development have been successfully used for safety and security critical systems. One reason why these formal methods are used is that it helps reduce the amount of testing required. For critical systems, the costs of [[Verification and validation|verification]] and validation are usually very high—more than 50% of the total system development costs.&lt;ref name=s2007 /&gt;

==Classification==

A critical system is distinguished by the consequences associated with system or function failure. Likewise, critical systems are further distinguished between fail-operational and fail safe systems, according to the tolerance they must exhibit to failures:&lt;ref name=marco&gt;{{cite book|first1=Marco|last1=Bozzano|first2=Adolfo|last2=Villafiorita|title=Design and Safety Assessment of Critical Systemss|location=Austin, Texas|year=2010|url=https://www.crcpress.com/Design-and-Safety-Assessment-of-Critical-Systems/Bozzano-Villafiorita/p/book/9781439803318|pages=298|isbn=9781439803318|publisher=Auerbach Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Fail-operational — typically required to operate not only in nominal conditions (expected), but also in degraded situations when some parts are not working properly. For example, airplanes are fail-operational because they must be able to fly even if some components fail.
* Fail-safe — must safely shut down in case of single or multiple failures. Trains are fail-safe systems because stopping a train is typically sufficient to put into safe state.

===Safety critical===
{{main|Life-critical system}}
''Safety critical'' systems deal with scenarios that may lead to loss of life, serious personal injury, or damage to the natural environment. Examples of safety-critical systems are a control system for a chemical manufacturing plant, aircraft, the controller of an unmanned train metro system, a controller of a nuclear plant, etc.&lt;ref name=s2007&gt;{{cite web|title=Mission Critical vs. Business Critical: HUH?|url=http://www.activestate.com/blog/2010/03/mission-critical-vs-business-critical-applications-huh|website=Activestate ActiveBlog}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lorcan /&gt;&lt;ref name=marco /&gt;

===Mission critical===
{{main|Mission critical}}
''Mission critical'' systems are made to avoid inability to complete the overall system, project objectives or one of the goals for which the system was designed. Examples of mission-critical systems are a navigational system for a spacecraft, software controlling a [[baggage handling system]] of an airport, etc.&lt;ref name=s2007 /&gt;&lt;ref name=lorcan /&gt;&lt;ref name=marco /&gt;

===Business critical===
''Business critical'' systems are programmed to avoid significant tangible or intangible economic costs; e.g., loss of business or damage to reputation. This is often due to the interruption of service caused by the system being unusable. Examples of a business-critical systems are the customer accounting system in a bank, stock-trading system, [[ERP system]] of a company, Internet search engine, etc.&lt;ref name=s2007 /&gt;&lt;ref name=lorcan /&gt;&lt;ref name=marco /&gt;

===Security critical===
''Security critical'' systems deal with the loss of sensitive data through theft or accidental loss.&lt;ref name=lorcan /&gt;

{{distinguish|Darwin Awards}}

[[Image:Charles Darwin aged 51.jpg|right|thumb|[[Charles Darwin]], for whom the award is named]]
The '''Darwin Medal''' is awarded by the [[Royal Society]] every alternate year for "work of acknowledged distinction in the broad area of [[biology]] in which [[Charles Darwin]] worked, notably in [[evolution]], [[population biology]], organismal [[biology]] and [[biological diversity]]". First awarded in 1890, it was created in memory of [[Charles Darwin]] and is presented with a £2000 prize (as of 2016).&lt;ref name="rs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://royalsociety.org/awards/darwin-medal/ |title=Darwin Medal |publisher=The Royal Society|accessdate=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with most of the Royal Society's medals, the award is open for candidates from the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] or of the [[Republic of Ireland]], with the requirement that they be either a citizen of such a nation or have lived in such a nation for at least three years before the nomination.&lt;ref name="rs"/&gt; 

Since its creation the medal has been awarded over 60 times, the recipients including [[Francis Darwin]], Charles Darwin's son, and two married couples, [[Jack Heslop-Harrison#University life|Jack and Yolande Heslop-Harrison]] in 1982 and [[Peter and Rosemary Grant]] in 2002. The medal was first awarded to [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], a noted biologist and naturalist who had independently developed the [[Natural Selection|Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection]].

The '''Edinburgh Festival Fringe''' (often referred to as simply '''The Fringe''' or '''Edinburgh Festival''') is the world's largest arts festival, which in 2018 spanned 25 days and featured more than 55,000 performances of 3,548 different shows&lt;ref name=BBC170828/&gt; in 317 venues.&lt;ref name=Scot170828/&gt; Established in 1947 as an alternative to the [[Edinburgh International Festival]], it takes place annually in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]], in the month of August.&lt;ref name=edfringeabout/&gt;

It is an open access (or "[[unjuried]]") performing arts festival, meaning there is no selection committee, and anyone may participate, with any type of performance. The official Fringe [[Event programme|Programme]] categorises shows into sections for theatre, comedy, dance, [[physical theatre]], [[circus]], [[cabaret]], children's shows, musicals, opera, music, [[spoken word]], exhibitions and events. Comedy is the largest section, making up over one-third of the programme and the one that in modern times has the highest public profile, due in part to the [[Edinburgh Comedy Awards]].

The Festival is supported by the [[Festival Fringe Society]], which publishes the programme, sells tickets to all events from a central physical box office and website, and offers year-round advice and support to performers. The Society's permanent location is at the Fringe Shop on the [[Royal Mile]], and in August they also manage Fringe Central, a separate collection of spaces in [[Appleton Tower]] and other [[University of Edinburgh]] buildings, dedicated to providing support for Fringe participants during their time at the festival.

The Fringe board of directors is drawn from members of the Festival Fringe Society, who are often Fringe participants themselves – performers or administrators. Elections are held once a year, in August, and Board members serve a term of four years. The Board appoints the Fringe Chief Executive (formerly known as the Fringe Administrator or Director), currently Shona McCarthy who assumed the role in March 2016.&lt;ref name="edfringeboard" /&gt; The Chief Executive operates under the chair, currently Professor Sir [[Timothy O'Shea]].&lt;ref name="edfringenewCEO" /&gt;

==History and origins==

[[File:1971 Festival Fringe Club Membership Card.jpg|thumb|1971 Festival Fringe Club Membership Card]]

===Early years===
The Fringe started life when eight theatre companies turned up uninvited to the inaugural [[Edinburgh International Festival]] in 1947. With the International Festival using the city's major venues, these companies took over smaller, alternative venues for their productions. Seven performed in Edinburgh, and one undertook a version of the medieval morality play "[[Everyman (play)|Everyman]]" in [[Dunfermline Abbey]], about 20 miles north, across the [[River Forth]] in Fife. These groups aimed to take advantage of the large assembled theatre crowds to showcase their own alternative theatre. Although at the time it was not recognised as such, this was the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe 1947|first Edinburgh Festival Fringe]].

This meant that two defining features of the future Fringe were established at the very beginning – the lack of official invitations to perform and the use of unconventional venues.{{sfn|Moffatt|1978|p=15}} Originally, these groups referred to themselves as the "Festival Adjuncts"&lt;ref name=UoG /&gt; and were also referred to as the "semi-official" festival.{{sfn|Fisher|2012|p=12}} It was not until the following year, 1948, that [[Robert Kemp (playwright)|Robert Kemp]], a Scottish playwright and journalist, is credited with coining the title "Fringe" when he wrote during the second [[Edinburgh International Festival]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Round the fringe of official Festival drama, there seems to be more private enterprise than before ... I am afraid some of us are not going to be at home during the evenings!&lt;ref name=Kemp480814 /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The word "fringe" had in fact been used in a review of ''Everyman'' in 1947, when a critic remarked it was a shame the show was so far out "on the fringe of the Festival".{{sfn|Moffatt|1978|p=17}} In 1950, it was still being referred to in similar terms, with a small 'f':&lt;ref name=DunCour500824/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
On the fringe of the official Festival there are many praiseworthy "extras," including presentations by the Scottish Community Drama Association and Edinburgh University Dramatic Society – ''[[Dundee Courier]]'', 24 August 1950
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Fringe did not benefit from any official organisation until 1951, when students of the [[University of Edinburgh]] set up a drop-in centre in the [[YMCA]], where cheap food and a bed for the night were made available to participating groups.

Late night revues, which would become a feature of Fringes, began to appear in the early 50s. The first one was the New Drama Group's ''After The Show'', a series of sketches taking place after [[Donald Pleasence]]'s ''Ebb Tide'', in 1952.{{sfn|Moffatt|1978|p=39}} Among the talent to appear in early Fringe revues were [[Ned Sherrin]] in 1955, and [[Ken Loach]] and [[Dudley Moore]] with the Oxford Theatre Group in 1958. Due to many reviewers only being able to attend Fringe events late night after the official festival was finished, the Fringe came to be seen as being about revues.{{sfn|Moffatt|1978|p=40-41}}

It was a few years before an official programme for the Fringe was created. [[John Menzies]] compiled a list of shows under the title "Other Events" in their omnibus festival brochure, but it was printer C.J. Cousland who was the first to publish a listings guide, in 1954.{{sfn|Moffatt|1978|p=17}}  This was funded by participating companies and was entitled "Additional Entertainments", since the name "Fringe" was still not yet in regular usage.{{sfn|Moffatt|1978|p=17}}

By that year, the Fringe was attracting around a dozen companies, and a meeting was held to discuss creating "a small organisation to act as a brain for the Fringe", or what ''[[The Scotsman]]'' called an "official unofficial festival".{{sfn|Fisher|2012|p=20}} A first attempt was made to provide a central booking service in 1955&lt;ref name=edfestpunter/&gt; by students from the university, although it lost money, which was blamed on those who had not taken part.{{sfn|Fisher|2012|p=20}}

Formal organisation progressed in 1959, with the formation of the Festival Fringe Society. The push for such an organisation was led by [[Michael Imison]], director of [[Oxford Theatre Group]].{{sfn|Fisher|2012|p=21}} A constitution was drawn up, in which the policy of not vetting or censoring shows was set out, and the Society produced the first guide to Fringe shows. Nineteen companies participated in the Fringe in that year. By that time it provided a "complete... counter-festival programme".{{sfn|Moffatt|1978|p=43}}

Not long after came the first complaints that the Fringe had become too big. Director [[Gerard Slevin]] claimed in 1961 that "it would be much better if only ten halls were licensed".{{sfn|Fisher|2012|p=13}}

===1960s and 1970s===

The artistic credentials of the Fringe were established by the creators of the [[Traverse Theatre]], [[John Calder]], [[James Haynes|Jim Haynes]] and [[Richard Demarco]], in 1963.{{sfn|Fisher|2012|p=14}} While their original objective was to maintain something of the Festival atmosphere in Edinburgh all year round, the Traverse Theatre quickly and regularly presented cutting-edge drama to an international audience at both the [[Edinburgh International Festival]] and the Fringe during August. It set a standard to which other companies on the Fringe aspired. The Traverse is occasionally referred to as "The Fringe venue that got away",{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} reflecting its current status as a permanent and integral part of the Edinburgh arts scene.

[[The Pleasance]], a venue since the first year of the Fringe, was also important in setting the artistic tone. [[Christopher Richardson (theatre founder)|Christopher Richardson]], founder of the [[Pleasance Theatre Trust]], became a major Fringe figure.{{sfn|Fisher|2012|p=14}}

Over the first two decades of the Fringe, each performing group used its own performing space, or venue. However, by the late 1960s, the concept of sharing a venue became popular, principally as a means of cutting costs. It soon became common for halls to host up to six or seven different shows per day. The obvious next step was to partition a venue into two or more performing spaces; the majority of today's major venues fit into this category.

For many years, the Fringe Club (variously in the High Street from 1971 and at [[Teviot Row House]] from 1981) provided nightly showcases of Fringe fare to allow audiences to sample shows. In its earlier years the club also provided a significant space for after-hours socialising at a time when Edinburgh's strict licensing laws meant a 10pm pub closing time.

Problems then began to arise as the Fringe became too big for students and volunteers to deal with. Eventually in 1969, the Fringe Society became a constituted body, and in 1970 it employed its first administrator, John Milligan, who stayed until 1976.&lt;ref name=edfestpunter/&gt;

Between 1976 and 1981, under the direction of [[Alistair Moffat]], the number of companies performing rose from 182 to 494, thus the Fringe ascended to its current position as the largest arts festival in the world. This was a deliberate policy by Moffat, who found it difficult to promote the Fringe on merit given the Society's position of neutrality. Increasing show numbers was therefore a way of attracting more attention.&lt;ref name=Venables170606/&gt; At this point, the Fringe operated on only two full-time members of staff.

===1980s===

The early 1980s saw the arrival of the "super-venue" – locations that contained multiple performing spaces. By 1981 when [[William Burdett-Coutts (promoter)|William Burdett-Coutts]] set up the [[Assembly (events promoter)|Assembly Theatre]] in the empty [[Georgian era|Georgian]] building [[Assembly Rooms (Edinburgh)|Assembly Rooms]] on [[George Street, Edinburgh|George Street]] (formerly the [[Edinburgh International Festival|EIF]] Festival Club), the investment in staging, lighting and sound meant that the original amateur or student theatricals were left behind.

[[Fringe Sunday]] started in the High Street in 1981 and moved, through pressure of popularity, to [[Holyrood Park]] in 1983. Fringe Sunday was held on the second Sunday of the Fringe when companies performed for free. Having outgrown even Holyrood Park, this showcase took place on [[The Meadows (park)|The Meadows]] and continued until 2008.

1981 was a watershed for comedy at the Fringe too. It was the first year of the [[Perrier Award]] (now known as the Edinburgh Comedy Awards). The [[alternative comedy]] scene was also beginning to take shape. Previously, comedy at the Fringe had taken the form of student revues. Now stand-up was becoming a feature. According to [[Alexei Sayle]], "The Fringe then was entirely University revues and plays; there was not a single piece of stand-up comedy until me and Tony [Allen] arrived."&lt;ref name=Venables170509/&gt; Comedy began an ascent which would see it become the biggest section of the programme by 2008.

The following year, 1982, The Circuit was prominent, situated on a piece of empty ground popularly known as "The Hole in The Ground".&lt;ref name=Venables170711/&gt; This was once the site of a church building ([[Poole's Synod Hall]]), which was converted to a cinema, and where the Saltire complex was subsequently built in the early 1990s. The new [[Traverse Theatre]] opened here in 1993.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} It had a 700 seat marquee auditorium, which hosted, among other things, opera, even though the organisers had been told it was no such place for the artform.&lt;ref name=Venables170711/&gt; The next year it became a "tented village", with several smaller tents. [[Malcolm Hardee]] made his debut here as part of [[The Greatest Show On Legs]].&lt;ref name=Venables170711/&gt;

There was still theatre done on a shoestring, but several cultural entrepreneurs had raised the stakes to the point where a venue like Aurora (St Stephen's Church, [[Stockbridge, Edinburgh|Stockbridge]]) could hold its head up in any major world festival.

In 1986, promoter Karen Koren established [[The Gilded Balloon]] as a comedy venue in the former J. &amp; R. Allan's department store on [[Cowgate]]. A 3am late licence made it a home for late night socialising for comedians and the raucous late night show [[Late 'n' Live]] was started there.&lt;ref name=Venables170802/&gt; 
 
In 1988 the Society moved from 170 High Street to its current expanded headquarters on the [[Royal Mile]].

===1990s and 2000s===
[[File:John Bishop performing at Fringe Select.jpg|thumb|John Bishop performing at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe]]

Acts such as The [[Jim Rose Circus]] and [[Tokyo Shock Boys]] performed in the 1990s.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

The Fringe Club ceased operation in 2004, but various venues still provide "the Best of the Fest" and similar.

A computerised booking system was first installed in the early 1990s, allowing tickets to be bought at a number of locations around the city. The internet began to have an impact in 2000 with the launch of the Fringe's official website, which sold over half a million tickets online by 2005. The following year, a Half Price Ticket Tent, run in association with ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]'' newspaper, started offering special ticket prices for different shows each day. This sold 45,000 tickets in its first year.

In 2008, the Fringe faced the biggest crisis in its history when the computerised ticketing system failed. The events surrounding the failed box office software led to the resignation of Fringe Director Jon Morgan after only one full year in post.&lt;ref name=Venables170802/&gt; The resultant financial loss suffered by the Fringe Society was estimated at £300,000,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/feb/04/edinburgh-fringe-ticketing-system|title=Edinburgh festival: Report slams Fringe ticketing fiasco|last=Carrell|first=Severin|date=2009-02-04|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; which it was forced to meet from its reserves, although other sources report this at £900,000.&lt;ref name=Venables170802/&gt; These events attracted much comment from the UK and world media. More debts emerged as the year went on, and an independent report criticised the Board and the current and previous Fringe Directors for a failure of management and an inability to provide the basic service.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Board eventually decided that the post of "Director" (instituted in 1992 in lieu of "Fringe Administrator") would be abolished and replaced by a Chief Executive, to reinforce the Fringe head's basic administrative function. A report into the failure was commissioned from accountancy firm Scott-Moncrieff.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Several venues now use their own ticketing systems; this is partly due to issues of commissions and how ticket revenue is distributed, but was reinforced by this 2008 failure of the main box office.

The same year, other incidents conspired to add to the negative publicity. [[Fringe Sunday]] – a vast free showcase of events held on [[The Meadows (park)|The Meadows]] – was cancelled when a sponsor could not be secured.&lt;ref name="Guardian090110"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Venables170802/&gt; The "Big Four" venues - [[Assembly (events promoter)|Assembly]], [[Gilded Balloon]], [[Pleasance Theatre Trust|The Pleasance]] and [[Underbelly (events promoter)|Underbelly]] - also decided to market themselves as [[Edinburgh Comedy Festival]],&lt;ref name=Venables170802/&gt; which drew criticism from some quarters.
[[File:180 High Street Edinburgh Fringe Office.jpg|thumb|The Fringe Office at 180 High Street]]
After an interim period, during which Tim Hawkins, formerly general manager of [[Brighton Komedia]] took charge, the established [[Edinburgh Book Festival]] and Fringe manager Kath Mainland was appointed in February 2009 to stabilise the situation, becoming the Fringe's first Chief Executive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/inspire-me/festivals/kath-mainland-looks-forward-to-life-beyond-the-fringe-1-3943819|title=Kath Mainland looks forward to life beyond the Fringe|last=Ferguson|first=Brian|date=2015-11-10|work=The Edinburgh Evening News|access-date=2018-03-16|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comedy finally surpassed theatre as the biggest section of the programme in 2008, with 660 comedy entries to 599.&lt;ref name=Venables170802/&gt;

In 2009, [[theSpaceUK]] launched&lt;ref name="test"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thespaceuk.com/edinburgh/thespaces-surgeons-hall-v53/ |title=theSpace @ Surgeons Hall (V53) – Edinburgh Fringe Venues |website=TheSpaceUK.com |date=20 June 2014 |accessdate=24 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; their multi-space complex at the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh|Royal College of Surgeons]]. In 2011, a new all-year-round multi-arts festival venue, containing ten performance spaces, opened in the former [[Royal (Dick) Veterinary School]] under the name [[Summerhall]].

===The Fringe today===

[[File:Antoine on the Fringe.JPG|thumb|left|Street performer in the High Street]]
In 2016, Shona McCarthy, who had led [[Derry|Derry-Londonderry]]'s term as [[UK City of Culture]], took over from Kath Mainland as Chief Executive.&lt;ref name=edfringenewCEO/&gt;

During the Fringe the pedestrianised area of the High Street around [[St Giles' Cathedral]] and the Fringe Office becomes the focal point for theatre companies to hand out flyers, perform scenes from their shows, and attempt to sell tickets. These performances run alongside the Fringe Street Events which feature more than 200 street performers and thousands of buskers on the High Street and Mound Precinct. Many shows are "2 for 1" on the first Monday and Tuesday of the festival and different venues operate independent ticket offers throughout the festival.

{{see|List of Edinburgh Festival Fringe venues}}

Fringe venues come in all shapes and sizes, with use being made of nearly any viable space that is available, from regular theatres (e.g. the Traverse or [[Bedlam Theatre]]), function rooms (e.g. the [[Assembly Rooms (Edinburgh)|Assembly Rooms]]), churches and church halls (e.g. the [[Quaker Meeting House, Edinburgh|Quaker Meeting House]], Paradise in Augustines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paradise-green.co.uk/2014-programme/|title=Paradise Green |accessdate=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;), lecture theatres (including the notable [[George Square Theatre]]), conference centres, other university rooms and spaces, bars and pubs, temporary structures ([[The Famous Spiegeltent]] and the [[Udderbelly]]), schools, a public toilet, the back of a taxi, a double-decker bus and even in the audience's own homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2000/aug/08/artsfeatures.edinburghfestival2000|title=All the flat's a stage|last=Gardner|first=Lyn|date=7 August 2000|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The groups that operate the venues are also diverse: some are commercial and others not-for-profit; some operate year-round, while others exist only to run venues at the Fringe. Some are local, others are based in London and elsewhere and transfer to Edinburgh for August.

From the performers' perspective, the decision on where to perform is typically based on a mixture of cost, location (close proximity to the main Fringe hubs around the University is seen as an advantage), and the philosophy of the venue – some of whom specialise in amateur, school or college productions, some of whom are semi or wholly professional.

In 2018 there were more than 3,500 shows registered in the programme taking place in 317 different venues.

The main venue operators can broadly be split into four groups:
* '''The Big Four'''&lt;ref name=CTF/&gt; – [[Assembly (events promoter)|Assembly]], [[Gilded Balloon]], [[Pleasance Theatre Trust|The Pleasance]], [[Underbelly (events promoter)|Underbelly]]. These are the largest venue operators, and in many cases the most long-standing (Underbelly being a relative newcomer, having been founded in 2000). They each operate multi-room venue complexes, often across multiple sites. They tend to specialise in comedy, and in 2008, they briefly and controversially tried to re-brand themselves as [[Edinburgh Comedy Festival]].
* '''Other paid venues''' – Besides the Big Four, there are a number of mid-scale operators running multi-room venues, and again sometimes operating across more than one site. These include [[C venues]], [[Greenside Venues]], [[Sweet Venues]], [[Just the Tonic]], and Paradise Green. They may specialise in certain genres (comedy at Just the Tonic, theatre at Greenside Venues) or run a programme across all genres (C venues). 
* '''Free venues''' – Some promoters use a different financial model. Instead of charging performers to hire the room, and audiences to attend, they make their spaces available for free, with audiences making a donation at the end of the show if they have enjoyed it. These promoters tend to operate out of pubs and clubs – the rooms being made free to use as a way of boosting bar takings. The original [[Free Fringe]] was set up by comedian [[Peter Buckley Hill]] in response to the increasing costs to performers of appearing at the Fringe. Other "free" promoters, including former associates of Buckley Hill, have since adapted the model, with [[Laughing Horse]]'s Free Festival being the other prominent one. Although strictly speaking "Free Fringe" refers to Buckley Hill's operation, it is now often used as shorthand for any free venue.
* '''Pay What You Want''' – In 2013 comedian [[Bob Slayer]] introduced a new model to the Fringe, at his [[Heroes of Fringe]] venues, where punters could 'Buy a ticket in advance to guarantee a seat or Pay What You Want on exit'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2013/04/17/17644/the_free_shows_you_can_pay_for |title=The free shows you can pay for... : News 2013 : Chortle : The UK Comedy Guide |publisher=Chortle |date=17 April 2013 |accessdate=24 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model is a mixture of Paid and Free and enables performers to find a paying audience without risking large marketing spend. [[Phil Kay]], [[Tom Binns]] and [[Miss Behave]] were amongst the first established acts to embrace this model along with [[Adrienne Truscott]] who won the [[Edinburgh Comedy Awards]] Panel Prize with a PWYW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-23808788|title=Bridget Christie wins Foster's Edinburgh comedy award|first=Steven|last=Brocklehurst|date=24 August 2013|website=Bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adam Hess]] was nominated for best newcomer in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedyawards.co.uk/biogs/Newcomer_AdamHess.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2 May 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308050340/http://www.comedyawards.co.uk/biogs/Newcomer_AdamHess.html |archivedate=8 March 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other promoters such as Just the Tonic, Pleasance and C Venues have since introduced the model to their venues. In 2016, Gilded Balloon adopted PWYW for the Counting House venue, which had previously been a Free Festival venue,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2016/02/26/24269/gilded_balloon_to_offer_pay_what_you_want |title=Gilded Balloon to offer 'pay what you want' : News 2016 : Chortle : The UK Comedy Guide |publisher=Chortle |date=26 February 2016 |accessdate=24 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has since returned to that model.

There also continue to be single, independent venues, sometimes only hosting one show, sometimes only for a limited period.

==Shows==
===Notable shows===
Many notable original shows originated at the Fringe and it has helped establish the careers of many writers and performers, including [[Rowan Atkinson]], [[Steven Berkoff]], [[Jo Brand]], [[Billy Connolly]], [[Ben Elton]], [[Eddie Izzard]], [[Tim Minchin]], and [[Tadeusz Kantor]].{{sfn|Fisher|2012|p=14}}

In 1960, [[Alan Bennett]], [[Dudley Moore]], [[Peter Cook]] and [[Jonathan Miller]] performed at the [[Royal Lyceum Theatre]] in ''[[Beyond the Fringe]]'', introducing a new wave of British satire and heralding a change in attitudes towards politicians and [[the establishment]]. Ironically, this show was put together by the Edinburgh International Festival as a rebuff to the emerging Fringe. But its title alone helped publicise "the Fringe", especially when it went on to London's [[West End theatre|West End]] and New York's [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] for the next 12 months.&lt;ref name=BTF/&gt;

[[Tom Stoppard]]'s play, ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead]]'' was first performed in its full version at the 1966 Fringe.&lt;ref name=Stoppard/&gt;
Noted actor [[Derek Jacobi]] starred in a [[sixth-form]] production of ''[[Hamlet]],'' which was very well regarded.&lt;ref name=Times120224/&gt;

During the 1980s, the Fringe attracted a number of major touring companies. [[Joint Stock Theatre Company]], a leading innovative touring company at that time, brought two productions to the Fringe – ''The Great Celestial Cow'' by [[Sue Townsend]] and ''Fire in the Lake'' by [[Karim Alrawi]].

In 1986, the Fringe saw the break-out performance of [[Craig Ferguson]] as "Bing Hitler", a "parody of all the über-patriotic native folk singers who seemed to infect every public performance in Scotland".&lt;ref name=NYT091001/&gt;

In the 21st century, shows that have debuted at the Fringe and then gone on to wider fame (or notoriety) include [[Stomp (theatrical show)|''Stomp'' (theatrical show)]], [[Black Watch (play)|''Black Watch'']] by the [[National Theatre of Scotland]], and ''[[Jerry Springer: The Opera]]''.{{sfn|Fisher|2012|p=14}}

[[2003 Edinburgh Festival Fringe|2003]] saw a very successful production of ''[[Twelve Angry Men (play)|12 Angry Men]]'' staged at the [[Assembly Rooms (Edinburgh)#Edinburgh Festival Fringe|Assembly Rooms]] using established comedians in the roles of the twelve jurors. It starred [[Owen O'Neill]] in the role made famous by [[Henry Fonda]], Juror No. 8. [[Stephen Frost]], [[Phil Nichol]] and [[Bill Bailey]] also featured.&lt;ref name=Chortle090518/&gt;

A 2004 version of ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (play)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'' was beset by problems, including the lead actor [[Christian Slater]] contracting chicken pox and the original director, Guy Masterson, quitting the project before it opened. Masterson was replaced by [[Terry Johnson (dramatist)|Terry Johnson]].&lt;ref name=Gardner040819/&gt;

In 2005, a production of [[Neil Simon]]'s ''[[The Odd Couple (play)|The Odd Couple]]'' starring [[Bill Bailey]] and [[Alan Davies]] was staged at the [[Assembly Hall]], the meeting place on the Mound of the [[Church of Scotland]]. This had been taken over by Assembly Theatre and transformed into an 840-seat theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/news/2005/05/12/19262.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=20 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060213033722/http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/news/2005/05/12/19262.shtml |archivedate=13 February 2006 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{importance inline}}

The [[Edinburgh Tattoo|Tattoo]] set-up at [[Edinburgh Castle]] served as the 6,000-seat venue for a one-off performance by [[Ricky Gervais]] of his stand-up show ''Fame'' in 2007. Gervais was accused of greed&lt;ref name=Ferguson090416/&gt; and taking audiences away from smaller shows. Gervais donated the profits from the show to [[Macmillan Cancer Support]].&lt;ref name=Fraser070828 /&gt;

In 2015, the [[Robert J. Sherman|Sherman]]/[[Stewart Nicholls|Nicholls]] original musical production of ''[[Love Birds (musical)|Love Birds]]'' made its premiere at [[The Pleasance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lovebirdsthemusical.com/press-reviews/ |title=Reviews |publisher=Lovebirds The Musical |date= |accessdate=24 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vale |first=Paul |url=https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2015/love-birds/ |title=Love Birds review at Edinburgh Festival Fringe |website=Thestage.co.uk |date=9 August 2015 |accessdate=24 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arthur Smith has performed regularly at the Festival for over 40 years now (since 1977),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-14444948 BBC News]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://amp.theguardian.com/culture/2003/aug/03/edinburghfestival2003.features The Guardian - It’s Hell Without The Drink]&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Merton has been performing regularly at the festival since 1985 (33 Years).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/culture/edinburgh-festivals/the-stars-who-made-it-big-at-the-edinburgh-fringe-1-4498598 The Scotsman - The Stars Who Made It Big At The Edinburgh Fringe]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.skiddle.com/whats-on/Edinburgh/Pleasance-Courtyard/PAUL-MERTON8217S-IMPRO-CHUMS/13265916/?utm_expid=.4K-aGCJIRBubXvFzDIzatQ.0&amp;utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.co.uk%2F Skiddle - Paul Merton's Impro Chums]&lt;/ref&gt; Barry Cryer has performed at about 25 Edinburgh Fringes (since the 90’s)&lt;ref&gt;[https://broadwaybaby.com/news/the-barry-cryer-extended-interview/507 Broadway Baby]&lt;/ref&gt; and Richard Herring has performed at 25 Fringes (since 1987).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.richardherring.com/journalism/10144/metro_177.html The Metro]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Officials and administrators===
The first chair of the board of directors was Lord Grant, a High Court judge, who gave way in 1970 to the actor [[Andrew Cruickshank]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} He was succeeded in 1983 by [[Jonathan Miller]], and then by [[Elizabeth Smith, Baroness Smith of Gilmorehill|Elizabeth Smith, Baroness Smith]] (widow of former Labour Leader [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]]). The current chair is Professor Sir [[Timothy O'Shea]], who succeeded Baroness Smith in 2012.&lt;ref name=edfringeboard/&gt;

The first full-time Fringe chief was former teacher, John Milligan, who left in 1976 to run the [[Craigmillar Festival Society|Craigmillar Festival]]. He was succeeded by writer and historian [[Alistair Moffat]], who left in 1981 to become Head of Arts at [[Scottish Television]]. He was replaced by Michael Dale, who departed in 1986 to become Head of Events for the [[Glasgow Garden Festival]]. He was succeeded by his deputy, Mhairi Mackenzie-Robinson, who left in 1993 to pursue a career in business. Hilary Strong served in the position until 1999, when she then became director of the [[Greenwich Theatre]]. She was followed by Paul Gudgin (2000–2007), Jon Morgan (2007–2008), and Kath Mainland (2008–2016). In November 2015, Mainland announced her decision to step down as Chief Executive to take on the role of Executive Director of the [[Melbourne Festival]],&lt;ref name="edfringeoldCEO" /&gt; and in early 2016 it was announced that her successor would be Shona McCarthy, who had headed up the 2013 Derry~Londonderry [[UK City of Culture]].&lt;ref name="edfringenewCEO" /&gt; She took up the position in March 2016.

===Promoters and artistic directors===
The Fringe has made the careers of many on the artistic and organisational side of the Fringe. [[William Burdett-Coutts]], [[Karen Koren]], [[Anthony Alderson]] and [[Charlie Wood (events promoter)|Charlie Wood]] and [[Ed Bartlam]], the directors of the so-called "Big Four" venues have become well-known on the cultural scene.{{sfn|Fisher|2012|p=14}}

==Ethos==

The Fringe is an open access festival. The role of the Fringe Society is solely to facilitate the festival, concentrating mainly on the challenging logistics of organising such a large event.  Alistair Moffat (Fringe administrator 1976–1981) summarised the role of the Society when he said, "As a direct result of the wishes of the participants, the Society had been set up to help the performers that come to Edinburgh and to promote them collectively to the public. It did not come together so that groups could be invited, or in some way artistically vetted. What was performed and how it was done was left entirely to each Fringe group". This approach is now sometimes referred to as an ''[[unjuried]] festival'', ''open access arts festival'' or a ''[[fringe theatre|fringe festival]].&lt;ref name="edfringe.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.edfringe.com/about-us |title=About us &amp;#124; Edinburgh Festival Fringe |publisher=The Edinburgh Festival Fringe Society |accessdate=28 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;''

Over the years, this approach has led to adverse criticism about the quality of the Fringe. Much of this criticism comes from individual arts critics in national newspapers, hard-line aficionados of the [[Edinburgh International Festival]], and occasionally from the [[Edinburgh International Festival]] itself.

The Fringe's own position on this debate may be summed up by Michael Dale (Fringe Administrator 1982–1986) in his book ''Sore Throats &amp; Overdrafts'', "No-one can say what the quality will be like overall. It does not much matter, actually, for that is not the point of the Fringe ... The Fringe is a forum for ideas and achievement unique in the UK, and in the whole world ... Where else could all this be attempted, let alone work?". Views from the middle ground of this perennial debate point out that the Fringe is not complete artistic anarchy. Some venues do influence or decide on the content of their programme, such as the Traverse and Aurora Nova, who used to run their own venue but are now just a production group.

The Fringe itself at times sprouts a fringe. While the festival is unjuried, participating in the Fringe requires registration, payment of a registration fee,&lt;ref name="costs"&gt;{{cite web|title=Costs &amp; Deadlines |url=https://www.edfringe.com/story.html?id=2157&amp;area_id=45 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619095259/http://www.edfringe.com/story.html?id=2157&amp;area_id=45 |archivedate=19 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
and use of a Fringe venue. For example, the 2008 registration fee was £289.05.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|title=How much will it cost?

|archivedate=7 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some outdoor spaces also require registration, notably the Royal Mile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.edfringe.com/area.html?r_menu=global&amp;id=223 |title=High Street Information |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091005012257/http://www.edfringe.com/area.html?r_menu=global&amp;id=223 |archivedate=5 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.edfringe.com/story.html?id=2764&amp;area_id=223 |title=Performers |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091005035942/http://www.edfringe.com/story.html?id=2764&amp;area_id=223 |archivedate=5 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus some artists perform outside the auspices of the Fringe, either individually or as part of a festival or in association with a venue, either outdoors or in non-Fringe venues.

Started by [[Deborah Pearson]] in 2007, and continuing in 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011, under the co-directorship of Andy Field and Pearson, a primary "Fringe of the Fringe" festival is held,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forestfringe.co.uk/ |title=Forest Fringe |publisher=Forest Fringe |accessdate=28 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The aim is to encourage experimentation by reducing costs to performers – not charging for space, and providing accommodation. The same applies to audiences: all shows being "pay what you can".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forestfringe.co.uk/aboutus.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=8 February 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090622071340/http://www.forestfringe.co.uk/aboutus.htm |archivedate=22 June 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
The concept of [[fringe theatre]] has been copied around the world. The largest and most celebrated of these spawned festivals are [[Adelaide Fringe Festival]], [[National Arts Festival]] in Grahamstown, South Africa, and [[Edmonton International Fringe Festival]]. The number of such events continues to grow, particularly in the USA and Canada.  In the case of Edinburgh, the Fringe is an addition to the Festival proper, being officially known as the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.  Where there is no pre-existing Festival to be added to – such as New York (est. 1997) – or where the festival is more "fringe" than anything else, the word comes before the word "festival", thus the "Adelaide Fringe Festival." (est. 1979).

In the field of drama, the Edinburgh Fringe has premièred several plays, most notably ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead]]'' by [[Tom Stoppard]] (1966) and ''[[Moscow-Petushki|Moscow Stations]]'' (1994), which starred [[Tom Courtenay]]. Over the years, it has attracted a number of companies that have made repeated visits to the Fringe, and in doing so helped to set high artistic standards.  They have included: the London Club Theatre Group (1950s), [[7:84]] Scotland (1970s), the Children's Music Theatre, later the National Youth Music Theatre under Jeremy James Taylor, the National Student Theatre Company (from the 1970s), Communicado (1980s and 1990s), Red Shift (1990s), Grid Iron and [[Fitchburg State University]]. The Fringe is also the staging ground of the American High School Theatre Festival.

In the field of comedy, the Fringe has provided a platform that has allowed the careers of many performers to bloom. In the 1960s, various members of the [[Monty Python]] team appeared in student productions, as subsequently did [[Rowan Atkinson]], [[Stephen Fry]], [[Hugh Laurie]] and [[Emma Thompson]], the latter three with the 1981 [[Cambridge Footlights]]. Atkinson was at Oxford. Notable companies in the 1980s have included [[Complicite]] and the [[National Theatre of Brent]]. More recent comedy performers to have been 'discovered' include [[Rory Bremner]], [[Fascinating Aïda]], [[Reduced Shakespeare Company]], [[Steve Coogan]], [[Jenny Eclair]], [[The League of Gentlemen]], [[Flight of the Conchords]], [[Al Murray]] and [[Rich Hall]].

Many performers have spoken highly of the Fringe, and the effect it has had on their career. Magician [[Paul Daniels]] first appeared at the Fringe in the twilight of his career in 2013, and commented, 'I've become Edinburgh's publicity agent. I tell everybody, "You've got to be in it."'{{sfn|Fisher|2012|p=15}}

In the 1996 book [[Bridget Jones's Diary]] by [[Helen Fielding]], the title character visits the Edinburgh Fringe and plans which shows she will see.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=pIZLDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT126&amp;lpg=PT126&amp;dq=bridget+jones+edinburgh+herring&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9hZoamIoS9&amp;sig=VAoR5ipX5czw2RBHr7ic033_2fw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjuu4i8mPzeAhVFiqQKHa4UDmwQ6AEwCXoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=bridget%20jones%20edinburgh%20herring&amp;f=false Bridget Jones's Diary]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

===Subject matter===

The freedom to put on any show has led periodically to controversy when individual tastes in sexual explicitness or religion have been contravened. This has brought some into conflict with local city councillors. There have been the occasional performing groups who have deliberately tried to provoke controversy as a means of advertising their shows, but cracking down on sexual explicitness has led to shows being unfairly censored&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.richardherring.com/warmingup/08/05/2012/index.html Warming Up]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ticket prices===
[[File:High Street phone booth during Festival.JPG|thumb|160px|Fringe show flyers and posters compete for space on a High Street phone booth]]
In the mid-1990s, only the occasional top show charged [[GB£|£]]10 per seat, while the average price was £5–£7; in 2006, prices were frequently over £10, and reached £20 for the first time in 2006, for a one-hour show. Reasons people put forward for the increases include: increasing costs of hiring large venues, theatre licences and related costs—and the price of accommodation during the [[Edinburgh Festival]], which is expensive for performers as well as for audiences.

In recent years, two organisations—The [[Free Fringe]] and The Laughing Horse [[Free Edinburgh Fringe Festival]]—have introduced free entry shows that collect donations at the end of each performance. 22 shows came under this banner in 2005, growing rapidly to over 600 in 2011. There was also the "pay what you can" model of the [[Forest Café|Forest Fringe]], and "Pay What You Want" as introduced by [[Bob Slayer]]'s [[Heroes of Fringe]] discussed above.

===Costs to performers===
Putting on a show at the Fringe with the big venues can be costly to performers,&lt;ref name="costs"/&gt; due to registration fees, venue hire, cost of accommodation, and travel to Edinburgh. In recent years venue costs and the need for expensive marketing have been increasingly challenged by Free and other Independent venues. There is a change happening at the Fringe and performers can increasingly negotiate with the big venues. The festival is also a networking opportunity, training ground or springboard for future career advancement, and exciting and fun for performers as well as spectators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.edfringe.com/story.html?id%3D346%26area_id%3D45 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=8 February 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912225525/http://www.edfringe.com/story.html?id=346&amp;area_id=45 |archivedate=12 September 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Costs to venues===
Putting on shows is costly to venues as well, due to theatre licence fees which by 2009 had risen 800% in the preceding three years, and were eight times as high as fees in English cities, starting at £824 for a venue of up to 200 people and rising to £2,472 for a venue of up to 5,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/edinburghinternationalfestival/39Pure-greed39-of-80037-rise.5544517.jp 'Pure greed' of 800% rise in venue fees], by Tim Cornwell, ''[[The Scotsman]],'' 12 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; These fees have been cited as punitive to smaller venues and site-specific performances by such figures as Julian Caddy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sweetvenues.com/ |title=Sweet Venues |publisher=Sweet Venues |date= |accessdate=24 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which in 2009 featured site-specific shows in such venues as [[Inchcolm]] island and a swimming pool at the [[Apex Hotels|Apex International Hotel]].

===Pay-To-Play===
In 2012, there was criticism of the increasing commercialism of the Pay-To-Play fringe venues who charge acts to perform in advance of the Fringe. In many cases venue costs such as: venue rents / guarantees, compulsory marketing and various deductions mean that performers are being charged more than they can make back in ticket sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thejohnfleming.wordpress.com/2012/08/04/how-the-edinburgh-fringe-is-financed-the-article-which-you-cannot-read-in-this-mornings-edition-of-the-scotsman/ |title=How the Edinburgh Fringe is financed: the article which you cannot read in this morning’s edition of The Scotsman &amp;#124; SO IT GOES – John Fleming's blog |publisher=Thejohnfleming.wordpress.com |accessdate=18 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Claire Smith |url=http://www.scotsman.com/the-scotsman/scotland/don-t-ask-about-dosh-the-true-cost-of-staging-a-fringe-show-1-2489626 |title=Don't ask about dosh: The true cost of staging a Fringe show – Scotland |work=The Scotsman |date=25 August 2012 |accessdate=19 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stewart Lee stated in ''The Guardian'': "For decades, the Fringe has been a utopia for artists and performers – but now profit-obsessed promoters are tearing it to pieces."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stewart Lee |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/jul/30/stewart-lee-slow-death-edinburgh-fringe |title=Stewart Lee: the slow death of the Edinburgh Fringe &amp;#124; Culture |work=The Guardian |date=30 July 2012 |accessdate=18 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heroes of Fringe (Previously called The Alternative Fringe) was set up by Bob Slayer as a statement against Pay-To-Play venues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/correspondents/2012/03/23/15107/the_edinburgh_fringe_is_the_real_pay-to-play_scandal |title=The Edinburgh Fringe is the real pay-to-play scandal : Correspondents 2012 : Chortle : The UK Comedy Guide |publisher=Chortle |date=23 March 2012 |accessdate=18 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theskinny.co.uk/comedy/fringe_2012/302325-stewart_lee_bob_slayer_how_fringe_escaped_its_certain_fate |title=Stewart Lee &amp; Bob Slayer: How The Fringe Escaped Its Certain Fate |publisher=Theskinny.co.uk |accessdate=18 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Fringe commentators agree that the Fringe will have to change and that the independent promoters are leading that change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.londonisfunny.com/edinburgh/29258/Edinburgh_Fringe_round-up_II_%E2%80%93_will_2012_be_a_turning_point |title=Edinburgh Fringe round-up II – will 2012 be a turning point? &amp;#124; Edinburgh is Funny |publisher=Londonisfunny.com |date=30 August 2012 |accessdate=18 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121205032535/http://www.londonisfunny.com/edinburgh/29258/Edinburgh_Fringe_round-up_II_%E2%80%93_will_2012_be_a_turning_point |archivedate= 5 December 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/correspondents/2012/08/28/16039/the_future_of_the_fringe%3F_think_smaller |title=The future of the Fringe?

===Domination by comedy===
The comedy section has grown over recent decades to become the biggest section of the programme. The 2008 Fringe marked the first time that comedy has made up the largest category of entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/20913/comedy-overtakes-theatre-in-edinburgh | title=Comedy overtakes theatre in Edinburgh Festival Fringe first | last=Dibdin | first=Thom | date=5 June 2008 | work=The Staged | accessdate=16 June 2008 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907085801/http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/20913/comedy-overtakes-theatre-in-edinburgh | archivedate=7 September 2008 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to criticism that it has changed the nature of the Fringe, and separated it from its roots. [[Richard DeMarco]] has complained of "an infestation of stand-up comics... an epidemic for which there is no cure", which "overwhelms the possibility of serious theatre".&lt;ref name=Chortle141205/&gt; Others have commented that a large proportion of newer audiences are drawn almost exclusively to stand-up comics (particularly to television comedy stars in famous venues), and that they are starting to regard non-comedy events as "peripheral".{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==Reviews and awards==

===Sources of reviews===
For many groups at the Fringe, the ultimate goal is a favourable review—which, apart from the welcome kudos, may help minimise financial losses from putting on the show.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Edinburgh based newspaper ''[[The Scotsman]]'', known for its comprehensive coverage of the Edinburgh Festival, originally aimed to review every show on the Fringe. Now they are more selective, as there are simply too many shows to cover, although they do see almost every new play being staged as part of the Fringe's theatre programme, because of their Fringe First awards.

Other Scottish media outlets that provide coverage include: ''[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]'', ''[[Scotland on Sunday]]'', ''[[Sunday Herald]]'' and the Scottish edition of ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]''. Scottish arts and entertainment magazines ''[[The List (magazine)|The List]]'', ''[[The Skinny (magazine)|The Skinny]]'' and ''[[Fest Magazine]]'' also provide extensive coverage.

A number of independent reviewing organisations cover the Fringe, including ''[[Broadway Baby]]'', ''[[ThreeWeeks]]'', ''[[Chortle (website)|Chortle]]'', ''FringeReview'', ''The Wee Review'' and ''FringeGuru''.

The now defunct Festival Media Network was founded in 2010 to act as a trade organisation for these independent media. Its members were ''Broadway Baby'', ''Festival Previews'', ''Fringe Guru'', ''FringeReview'', ''Hairline'', ''iFringe'', ''ThreeWeeks'', ''The Podcast Network'', and ''WhatsOnStage''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.festivalmedianetwork.com/|title=Festival Media Network Website|publisher=Festival Media Network|accessdate=27 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the most prolific reviewers were [[Broadway Baby]] which published over 1900 reviews,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Broadway Baby: Edinburgh 2012|url=http://www.broadwaybaby.com/search.php?type=latestreview&amp;term=46&amp;ns=true|accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''ThreeWeeks'', which published 1000 reviews during August,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''ThreeWeeks'': All Reviews, Edinburgh 2012|url=http://www.threeweeks.co.uk/reviews/|website=Threeweeks.co.uk|accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Scotsman]]'' with 826 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The List: Top Rated|url=http://edinburghfestival.list.co.uk/top-rated/source:Scotsman%2Ecom/|website=Edinburghfestival.list.co.uk|accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The List (magazine)|The List]]'' published 480 reviews and ''WhatsOnStage.com'' published 52.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The List's Top-Rated Shows Statistics|url=http://edinburghfestival.list.co.uk/top-rated/|publisher=[[''The List'' (magazine)|''The List'']]|accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the London-based broadsheets also review, in particular ''[[The Guardian]]'' and ''[[The Independent]]'', while arts industry weekly ''[[The Stage]]'' publish a large number of Edinburgh reviews, especially of the drama programme.

Since 2010, the [[British Comedy Guide]] has collated comedy reviews from as many publications as possible. In 2018, it gathered over 4,700 reviews from 135 publications,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.comedy.co.uk/fringe/2018/features/best_reviewed_edinburgh_fringe_shows_2018/|title=Best reviewed Edinburgh Fringe shows 2018|publisher=[[British Comedy Guide]]|date=31 August 2018|accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; up from 4,300 from 83 different publications in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/fringe/2014/features/edinburgh_fringe_best_shows_2014/|title=Best reviewed Edinburgh Fringe shows 2014|publisher=[[British Comedy Guide]]|date=7 September 2015|accessdate=25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Awards===
[[File:GabrielByrne.jpg|thumb|[[Gabriel Byrne]] holding his Herald Angel]]
There are a growing number of awards for Fringe shows, particularly in the field of drama:
* ''[[The Scotsman]]'' introduced the prestigious Fringe First awards in 1973. These awards were established by ''Scotsman'' arts editor Allen Wright to encourage new theatre writing, and are given only to new plays (or new translations), and several are awarded for each of the three weeks of the Fringe – usually by a celebrity at a prestigious ceremony.
* ''Herald'' Angels and Archangels are awarded by the team of arts writers of ''[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]'' to performers or shows deemed worthy of recognition. Similar to Fringe Firsts, they are given each week of the Fringe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.herald-events.com/heraldangels/ |title=Herald Angels |website=Herald-events.com |date= |accessdate=24 September 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809230823/http://www.herald-events.com/heraldangels/ |archivedate=9 August 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[The Stage]]'' has awarded the [[Stage Awards for Acting Excellence]] since 1995. Around a dozen awards are given out each year, including a Special Award, given for the first time in 2014. Winners of the Special Award to date include [[Chris Goode (playwright)|Chris Goode]] (2014) and [[Pip Utton]] (2015).
*Total Theatre has presented its [[List of Total Theatre Award winners|Total Theatre Awards]] for excellence in the field of physical and visual theatre since 1997. The categories under which these awards are given vary from year to year. A notable addition in 2007 was the inclusion of a Wild Card award chosen by the festival-going public.
* [[Amnesty International]] introduced the Amnesty Freedom of Expression Award in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org.uk/news_details.asp?NewsID%3D17070 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=8 February 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925172818/http://www.amnesty.org.uk/news_details.asp?NewsID=17070 |archivedate=25 September 2006 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistics==
The first Fringe featured eight companies performing in five venues. By 1959, there were 19 companies; by 1969, 57; by 1979, 324. In 1981, there were 494, and the growth of the festival began to slow. But by 1999, there were over 600 companies giving 15,000 performances and in 2010, 1,900 giving 40,000.{{sfn|Fisher|2012|p=13}}

Statistics for 2011 Edinburgh Festival Fringe concluded that it was the largest on record: there were over 40,000 performances of over 2,500 different shows in 258 venues.&lt;ref name=Review11/&gt; Ticket sales amounted to around 1.8&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=Review11/&gt; There are now 12 full-time members of staff.

Of the shows, theatre had been the largest genre in terms of number of shows until 2008, when it was overtaken by comedy, which has been the major growth area over the last 20 years. At the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe 2015|2015 Fringe]] comedy was the biggest artform by number of shows, followed by theatre. The exact breakdown was: 34% comedy, 27% theatre, 14% music, 5% children's shows, 4% each cabaret/variety, dance/circus/physical theatre, spoken word, events, 3% musicals/opera, 2% exhibitions.&lt;ref name=Review15/&gt;

''' Emergenza''' is "the world's largest festival for [[unsigned artist|unsigned bands]], with concerts in more than 150 cities around the world."&lt;ref name=AIMNews/&gt; It features "up and coming bands from across the globe."&lt;ref&gt;Craig Robinson, "Colchester: Rock Band Stalker Hoping to Land Big Break at Emergenza Festival in Germany," EADT24]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are elimination rounds in different countries throughout the year, whereby the bands that advance are selected by the audiences that hear them. Emergenza judges choose the winners at regional and final concerts.&lt;ref name=AIMNews&gt;[http://www.aim.edu.au/news-and-events/emergenza-2012.asp ''AIM News,'' Australian Institute of Music]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first Emergenza Festival emerged in 1992, when a group of musician friends staged the first event in Rome, Italy, before an audience of 245. Five months later, the attendance had grown to three thousand, and in that year the festival's first [[compilation album]] was made. From 1993 to 2003 Emergenza recorded 54 such albums, both live and in studio. In 1995 the Emergenza logo was created.

On January 7, 1996, the Gibus Club in Paris hosted the first Emergenza concert outside Italy. One hundred thirteen bands signed up. The following year 2,500 people attended the first Emergenza European Final at the [[London Astoria]] in the United Kingdom.

In 2001, the festival crossed the Atlantic Ocean to Montreal, and in 2002 five cities hosted Emergenza; by 2003 more than 700 bands were playing 190 engagements in the first U.S. season. The following year, 2,876 musicians took part in the United States, and some sixteen thousand played for audiences in Europe and Canada.  In 2005, seventy North American cities took part.

The Emergenza Festival spread to both Japan and Australia in 2006, with shows in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Tokyo. Later, Perth in Western Australia and Brisbane were included in Australia's list. From 2008 through 2010, The Czech Republic, Slovenia, Russia and New Zealand began participating.

It premiered on [[CBS]] on Friday, January 13, 1978 at 8:00 pm EST.

==Synopsis==
A [[roast (comedy)|celebrity roast]] honoring [[Fred Flintstone]] on his 48th birthday featuring costumed Hanna-Barbera characters: [[Yogi Bear]], [[Jabberjaw]], [[Huckleberry Hound]], [[Scooby-Doo (character)|Scooby-Doo]], [[The Banana Splits]], [[Hong Kong Phooey]], [[Quick Draw McGraw]], [[Snagglepuss]], [[Wally Gator]] and [[Help!... It's the Hair Bear Bunch!|The Hair Bear Bunch]]. The show is co-hosted by [[Roy Clark]] and [[Bonnie Franklin]] which includes special guest stars [[The Sylvers]], the antics of British comedy duo Course &amp; Young (Mike Course and Bob Young), the Fenton kids (Steve, Robin, Jack, Lisa and Todd), Sashi Kuchiki, the [[Ice Capades|Ice Capettes]] and a special appearance by [[The Skatebirds]] (whose Saturday morning series was airing on CBS at the time).

As Fred and Barney rush off to the ice arena, the show continues with musical numbers, ice displays including a comedy team, precision skating, disco-on-ice, jazz skating and an acrobatic number with fiery torches.

'''''I Medici''''' is an opera in four acts composed by [[Ruggero Leoncavallo]], with a libretto by the composer.  Set in Renaissance Florence at the court of [[Lorenzo de' Medici]],  it was intended as the first part of a planned but unfinished trilogy called ''Crepusculum''. The opera premiered on 6 November 1893 at the [[Teatro Dal Verme]] in Milan.

==Background and performance history==

''I Medici''  was intended as the first part of a planned but unfinished trilogy called ''Crepusculum'', with the second and third operas to be called ''Savonarola'' and ''I Borgia.''&lt;ref name=Grove&gt;{{cite book|title=Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians|publisher=The Macmillan company|location=New York|page=680|edition=1911|editor=John Alexander Fuller-Maitland|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The word "crepusculum," is Latin for "twilight," signaling the influence of [[Richard Wagner]]'s tetralogy ''Der Ring des Nibelungen'' (whose fourth installment is called "Twilight of the Gods" (Gotterdammerung)).&lt;ref name="Dryden Life and Works"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dryden|first=Konrad|title=Leoncavallo: Life and Works|year=2007|publisher=Scarecrow Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining two operas were never completed.
Leoncavallo sought to create an "epic poem" for the stage.&lt;ref name="La Stampa review"&gt;{{cite news|last=Depanis|first=Giuseppe|title=Il libretto e la musica di I Medici|newspaper=La Stampa|date=Nov 12, 1893|page=2|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, one contemporary review of the premiere stated: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;In ''I Medici'' we have a historical opera like those that have been made many times before and will be hence ... [but] we do not have either an epoch or a set of characters brought truthfully to life; we do not have, in a word, that counterpart of the mythic trilogy [sic] of Wagner at which Leoncavallo has gazed. {{efn|Original Italian: "In I Medici abbiamo un'opera su sfondo storico come ce ne furono tante prima e come ce ne saranno dopo ... non abbiamo né un'epoca né un complesso di figure vive e vere; non abbiamo, in una parola, quel contrapposto umano alla trilogia mitica del Wagner a cui il Leoncavallo ha mirato.".&lt;ref name="La Stampa review" /&gt;}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It premièred at the [[Teatro Dal Verme]] in [[Milan]] on 9 November 1893.&lt;ref name="amadeus"&gt;{{Cite web

However, it was revived at the Frankfurt [[Alte Oper]] in 1993 in [[concert version]] conducted by [[Marcello Viotti]] (the opera's first performance in Germany) and was given a fully staged performance in March 2013 at the [[Theater Erfurt]] in [[Erfurt]], Germany conducted by Emmanuel Joel-Hornak.&lt;ref&gt;Molke, Thomas (5 April 2013).

==Background==
{{main article|Iraq War}}
The Iraq War&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;The conflict is also known as the ''War in Iraq'', the ''Occupation of Iraq'', the ''Second Gulf War'', ''Gulf War II'', and ''Gulf War 2''. The period of the war lasting from 2003 to 2010 was referred to as '''Operation Iraqi Freedom''' by the United States military.&lt;/ref&gt; was a protracted armed conflict that began with the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|U.S.-led invasion of Iraq]] in 2003, which toppled the government of [[Saddam Hussein]]. However, the war continued for much of the next decade as an insurgency emerged to oppose [[Multi-National Force&amp;nbsp;– Iraq|the occupying forces]] and the post-invasion Iraqi government.&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite web|title=Iraq War|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/870845/Iraq-War|work=Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=27 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States officially [[Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq|withdrew its troops from Iraq]] in 2011, but the insurgency and various dimensions of the civil armed conflict have continued.

The invasion began in 2003 when the United States, joined by the United Kingdom and several coalition allies, launched a "shock and awe" surprise attack without declaring war. Iraqi forces were quickly overwhelmed as U.S. forces swept throughout the country. The invasion led to the collapse of the [[Ba'athist Iraq|Ba'athist government]]; [[September 11 attacks|Saddam was captured]], and he was [[Execution of Saddam Hussein|executed]] by a military court three years later. However, the power vacuum following Saddam's fall, the mismanagement of [[Coalition Provisional Authority|the occupation]] and the sectarian policies of various militias&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Beauchamp|first=Zack|title=The real roots of Iraq's Sunni-Shia conflict|url=https://www.vox.com/2014/6/20/5827046/who-are-sunnis-who-are-shias|date=20 June 2014|accessdate=27 June 2014|agency=Vox}}&lt;/ref&gt; led to a [[Iraqi insurgency (2003–11)|lengthy insurgency]] against U.S., coalition forces and Iraqi government forces as well as widespread [[Civil war in Iraq (2006–07)|sectarian violence]] between [[Shia Islam|Shia]]s and [[Sunni Islam|Sunnis]]. The United States responded with a [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|troop surge in 2007]]; the heavy American security presence and deals made between the occupying forces and [[Sons of Iraq|Sunni militias]] reduced the level of violence. The U.S. began withdrawing its troops in the winter of 2007–2008. The winding down of U.S. involvement in Iraq accelerated under [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]]. The U.S. withdrew all combat troops from Iraq by 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=Associated Press |first=Ben |last=Feller |title=Obama sets firm withdrawal timetable for Iraq |date=27 February 2009 |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090227/ap_on_go_pr_wh/obama_iraq |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302175610/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090227/ap_on_go_pr_wh/obama_iraq |archivedate=March 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] based its [[Rationale for the Iraq War|rationale for war]] principally on the assertion that [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction]] (WMDs) and that Saddam's government posed an immediate threat to the United States and its coalition allies.&lt;ref&gt;Center for American Progress (29 January 2004) [http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/kfiles/b24970.html "In Their Own Words: Iraq's 'Imminent' Threat"] ''americanprogress.org''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nelson&gt;Senator [[Bill Nelson (politician)|Bill Nelson]] (28 January 2004) [https://fas.org/irp/congress/2004_cr/s012804b.html "New Information on Iraq's Possession of Weapons of Mass Destruction",] ''Congressional Record''&lt;/ref&gt; Some U.S.&amp;nbsp;officials accused Saddam of harboring and supporting [[al-Qaeda]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/003/033jgqyi.asp|title=The Weekly Standard, Saddam's al Qaeda Connection}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others cited the desire to end a repressive dictatorship and bring democracy to the people of Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;[https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2003/02/20030226-11.html "President Discusses the Future of Iraq"] The White House, 26 February 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/01/09/60minutes/main592330.shtml "Bush Sought ‘Way’ To Invade Iraq?"] ''60 Minutes''&lt;/ref&gt; After the invasion, however, no substantial evidence was found to verify the initial claims about WMDs. The rationale and misrepresentation of pre-war intelligence faced heavy [[Criticism of the Iraq War|criticism]] within the U.S. and internationally.

As a result of the war, Iraq held its [[Iraqi parliamentary election, January 2005|multi-party elections]] in 2005, and [[Nouri al-Maliki]] later became [[Prime Minister of Iraq|Prime Minister]] the following year. The Maliki government enacted policies that were widely seen as having the effect of alienating the country's Sunni minority, which worsened sectarian tensions. In 2014, ISIS launched a [[Northern Iraq offensive (June 2014)|military offensive in Northern Iraq]] and later declared a worldwide Islamic caliphate, eliciting another [[Military intervention against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|military response from the United States and its allies]]. The Iraq War caused hundreds of thousands of civilian and military casualties (see [[Iraq War#Casualty estimates|estimates]]). The majority of the casualties occurred as a result of the insurgency and civil conflicts between 2004 and 2007.

===2011===

As previously planned, the last US combat troops were withdrawn from Iraq in 2011, with security responsibility in the hands of the [[Iraqi Armed Forces]]. On 15 December, martial closing ceremony was held in Baghdad putting a formal end to the U.S. mission in Iraq.

====Sunni protests (2012)====
{{Further information|2012–14 Iraqi protests}}
After a period of calm, renewed political tension within Iraq led to renewed protests, this time mostly centered around the country's Sunni minority. The main cause for upheaval was the ongoing standoff between Vice President [[Tareq al-Hashemi]] and Prime Minister al-Maliki, but strained relationships with the Kurdish autonomous regions added to the scene. On December 23, 2012, several thousand Iraqis marched against al-Maliki, responding to his moves against al-Hashemi and other influential Sunni leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?ID=250700 | title = Iraq crisis stirs protests in Sunni strongholds | author = Reuters | date = 23 December 2011 | work = The Jerusalem Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three soldiers were later shot to death in retaliation for the incident, and clashes erupted in Askari, on the eastern outskirts of Fallujah. Security forces were placed on high alert as a curfew and vehicle ban were brought into effect. In a statement, Maliki urged both sides to show restraint and blamed the incident on unruly protesters.

In early March, unidentified gunmen ambushed a [[Syrian Army]] convoy escorted by Iraqi soldiers in the [[Battle of Akashat]], killing 48 Syrians and 13&amp;nbsp;Iraqis. The assault took place near the desert border between the two nations in Iraq's [[Al Anbar Governorate]].

'''Keat Hwa Centennial Celebrations''' ({{zh|s=吉华百年校庆 |t=吉華百年校慶 |p=Jíhuá Bǎinián Xiàoqìng}}) is a series of events held in celebration of the 100 years of existence of [[Keat Hwa Secondary School]], [[Keat Hwa II Secondary School]], [[Keat Hwa High School]] and three other Chinese primary schools.

Keat Hwa Centennial Celebrations also mark the existence of Chinese education in [[Malaysia]] for more than 100 years.

A centenary celebration committee was set up prior to the celebration by the Keat Hwa Alumni Organisation (吉华校友会). The committee is fully in charge of the celebrations with the co-operation from the school authorities. A series of events were organised throughout the year, culminating with a 3-day celebration, to mark this auspicious year for Keat Hwa, from 28 to 31 July 2011.

The 3-day gala event was held at the Keat Hwa Secondary School (吉华卓越华文中学) compound. Besides exhibition booths, there were several other unique and meaningful events organised.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dcniy2uki7M YouTube video recaping the best moment of the celebration, YouTube.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Among the huge events are the Grand Festival, Grand Dinner and the Grand Expo. Other events include the celebration of Mooncake Festival by all the six Keat Hwa schools, singing competition, torch relay, Chinese cultural activities and, most importantly, the celebration of Chinese education in Malaysia.

The 3-day event successfully attracted more than 35,000 students and alumnus from all over the world. The centenary celebration marked a milestone of Keat Hwa and showcased the success of the Chinese community in fighting for their own Chinese education, mother-tongue language and culture. Besides, the celebration was able to collect donations to set up an Education Fund for the usage of Keat Hwa schools in the coming years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://komunitikini.com/north/keat-hwa-school-celebrates-100-years Keat Hwa celebrates 100 years of existence: KomunitiKini.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The parade was the only major procession held in the city of Alor Setar in the last few decades to celebrate the anniversary of a school. The journey was roughly 5 kilometres and it caught the attention of the citizens of Alor Setar. Some even joined the parade which ended at the Keat Hwa Secondary School. The whole journey was held successfully with the help of the [[Royal Malaysia Police|Malaysian police]] and the [[RELA Corps|paramilitary civil volunteer corps]] controlling the traffic in the city.

A torch tower was designed and built for the Opening Ceremony with more than a million can tabs weighing more than 1100&amp;nbsp;kg. The preparation of the torch tower involved the participation of all students, teachers and alumnus of Keat Hwa Secondary School. The achievement was recorded into the Malaysia Book of Records.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.actimes.com.au/actimes/plus/view.php?aid=189265 Keat Hwa enters into the Malaysian Book of Records: AcTimes]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lyceum Theatre''' ({{IPAc-en|l|aɪ|ˈ|s|iː|ə|m}} {{respell|ly|SEE|əm}}) is a [[Broadway theatre]] located at 149 West [[45th Street (Manhattan)|45th Street]] near [[Times Square]] between [[Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)|Seventh]] and [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Sixth Avenue]] in [[Midtown Manhattan]], New York City.

==Overview==
Opened in 1903, the Lyceum Theatre is one of the three oldest surviving Broadway venues (along with the [[Hudson Theatre|Hudson]] and [[New Amsterdam Theatre|New Amsterdam]] Theatres).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.shubert.nyc/theatres/lyceum|title=Lyceum Theatre {{!}} Shubert Organization|website=www.shubert.nyc|access-date=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the oldest continuously operating legitimate theatre in [[New York City]], and the first Broadway theatre ever to be granted landmark status (1974).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/05/17/archives/lyceum-declared-a-landmark.html|title=Lyceum Declared a Landmark|date=1978-05-17|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-11-13|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the few theatres in New York which continues to operate under its original name.

Designed by architects [[Herts &amp; Tallant]] in the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts style]], the Lyceum was built by [[impresario]] [[Daniel Frohman]].  It opened on November 2, 1903, with the play ''The Proud Prince''. Frohman's brother [[Charles Frohman|Charles]] served as the theater's manager until his death in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nyc-architecture.com/MID/MID111.htm|title=New York Architecture Images- Lyceum Theater|website=nyc-architecture.com|access-date=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two previous New York playhouses had also been called "Lyceum Theatre". The [[Fourteenth Street Theatre]] used the name from 1871 to 1879. Frohman's own [[Lyceum Theatre (New York City, 1885)|earlier Lyceum]] on [[Fourth Avenue (Manhattan)|Fourth Avenue]], was built in 1885 and closed in April 1902. It was replaced by the new Lyceum on 45th Street.

Among the prominent performers who appeared on the Lyceum's stage in its early years were [[Ethel Barrymore]], [[Fanny Brice]], [[Billie Burke]], [[Ina Claire]], [[Miriam Hopkins]], [[Walter Huston]], [[Basil Rathbone]], and [[Cornelia Otis Skinner]]. It has been owned by the [[Shubert Organization]] since 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0362-4331| last = Zolotow| first = Sam| title = 'GOLDEN BOY' OPENS ON RIALTO TONIGHT; Revival of Clifford Odets Play at ANTA Playhouse -- John Garfield, Cobb in Cast| work = The New York Times| accessdate = 2018-10-19| date = 1952-03-12| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1952/03/12/archives/golden-boy-opens-on-rialto-tonight-revival-of-clifford-odets-play.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatre maintains most of its original [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] design, including its elaborate marble staircases and undulating marquee. Although it has three levels, it is one of the smaller Broadway theatres in terms of capacity, seating only 922. An apartment located above the orchestra, originally used by Frohman, is now the headquarters of the Shubert Archives.

The '''Marriage of the Sea''' ({{lang-it|Sposalizio del Mare}}), sometimes referred to as the '''Marriage of the Adriatic''', was an ancient ceremony which used to symbolize the maritime dominion of Venice.

The ceremony, established in about 1000 AD to commemorate the Doge [[Pietro II Orseolo]]'s conquest of [[Dalmatia]], was originally one of [[supplication]] and placation, [[Ascension Day]] being chosen as that on which the doge set out on his expedition. The form it took was a solemn procession of boats, headed by the doge's ship (from 1311 the [[Bucentaur]]), out to sea by the [[Lido di Venezia|Lido]] port. A prayer was offered that "for us and all who sail thereon the sea may be calm and quiet", whereupon the doge and the others were solemnly [[Aspersion|aspersed]] with [[holy water]], the rest of which was thrown into the sea while the priests chanted "''Aspergēs mē hȳsōpō, et mundābor''" ("Sprinkle me with [[Ezov|hyssop]], and I will be clean" – [[Psalms|Psalm]] 51:7).&lt;ref&gt;The full verse appears in the [[New International Version]] of the [[Bible]] thus: "Cleanse me with hyssop, and I will be clean; / wash me, and I will be whiter than snow." (Psalm 51:7.)&lt;/ref&gt;

To this ancient ceremony a quasi-[[sacrament]]al character was given by [[Pope Alexander III]] in 1177, in return for the services rendered by Venice in the struggle against the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I]]. The pope drew a ring from his finger and, giving it to the doge, bade him cast such a one into the sea each year on Ascension Day, and so wed the sea. Henceforth the ceremonial, instead of placatory and [[atonement in Christianity|expiatory]], became [[Wedding|nuptial]].

Every year the doge dropped a consecrated ring into the sea, and with the Latin words "''Desponsamus te, mare, in signum veri perpetuique domini''" ("We wed thee, sea, as a sign of true and everlasting domination"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Revised Latin Primer|last=Kennedy|first=Benjamin|publisher=Longmans|year=1962|isbn=|location=Great Britain|pages=19|chapter=35b|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) declared Venice and the sea to be indissolubly one.&lt;ref name="Festa della Sensa"&gt;{{citation|title=The Bucintoro|url=http://www.sevenonline.it/sensa/english/bucintorogb.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217015259/http://www.sevenonline.it/sensa/english/bucintorogb.htm|archivedate=17 February 2012|publisher=Comitato Festa della Sensa|accessdate=17 February 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"&gt;{{citation|contribution=Bucentaur|contribution-url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Bucentaur|editor=[[Hugh Chisholm]]|title=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|The Encyclopædia Britannica]]|edition=11th|location=Cambridge|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=1910–1911}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the end of the office of the [[doge]] and the destruction of the Bucentaur, the ceremony of the marriage of the sea continues to this day. It is performed by the mayor of Venice aboard a smaller ceremonial barge called the ''Bissona Serenissima''.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

The '''Matese Legion''' was a group of 240 Italian volunteers that joined [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] in the war for [[Italian unification]] in 1861. It was formed in Piedimonte D'Alife, now called [[Piedimonte Matese]], in June 1860, and was officially established on 25 August of the same year. Membership in the legion gradually declined, and it broke apart on 3 March 1861...&lt;ref name="goo"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Martino|first1=Angelo|title=La Legione garibaldina del Matese|url=http://www.comunedipignataro.it/?p=31227|website=Comune di Pignataro|accessdate=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Matese Legion was an unconventional legion in that it was created after a number of Garibaldian volunteers joined together with the aim of tearing down the Bourbon power in Piedimonte and supporting the Southern Army of Garibaldi as it proceed in its advance from [[Sicily]] to [[Rome]]. 1107 Garibaldian volunteers had left [[Genoa]] to reach Sicily on 5 May 1860, guided by Garibaldi and [[Nino Bixio]], an Italian general, as second in command. Their aim was to gain the approval of the population in order to take away power from the various insurrectionary movements in the south regions of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=O'Clery|first1=Patrick Keyes|title=The Making of Italy|date=1892|publisher=K. Paul, Trench, Trubner|location=London|pages=120, 121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mappamontidelmatese.png|thumb|Location of Matese mountains|213x213px|left]]  
After seeing the success that the Garibaldian campaign was having in Sicily, Beniamino Caso realized the value in creating a military troop to rebel against the Bourbon power, and in June 1860 in Piedimonte he assembled a group of liberal volunteers with the aim of overthrowing it. Originally nameless, the group was soon dubbed the Matese Legion by individuals in Turin, and the name was eventually adopted by all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Costarella|first1=Attilio|last2=Cervo|first2=Aldo|title=Atti della conferenza del 2003|date=15 March 2003|location=Piedimonte Matese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 August Beniamino Caso and Pasquale Casella travelled to [[Naples]] to personally pick up the weapons and the flag of the newly born legion. The two entered Piedimonte Matese the night of 24 August 1860 with the flag, 100 rifles and 12 boxes of amunition, and the following morning the legion was officially constituted.
The legion was organised into two different parties based upon the volunteers' area of origin, with the first party including the sections of Alvignano, Dragoni, S. Angelo d'Alife, Raviscanina e Piedimonte; the second one included the sections of S.Maria Capua Vetere, San Lorenzello and Calvi.
From Piedimonte the legion, under the command of Major De Blasiis, departed on 31 August for [[Benevento]]. He entered the city on 3 September, welcomed by the population after having been liberated from seven centuries of pontifical rule.

Throughout the period of unification, in addition to their participation in numerous battles, the legion was used to suppress brigandage and to provide public security alongside the authorities.&lt;ref name=goo /&gt;

==Battles==
===Battle of Caiazzo===
Between September 19 and 21, 1860, the Garibaldian armies fought against part of the Army of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies in [[Caiazzo]].
The Battle began on 19 September, when the Garibaldian Column, guided by the Hungarian Csudafy, approached the town of Caiazzo. On 20 September over 300 members of the Matese Legion joined Csudafy's Army. On 21 September the legion, under Csudafy, fought unsuccessfully alongside the Garibaldian Column against the Bourbon Army, which conquered and set fire to Caiazzo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="La Legione del Matese" e l’occupazione di Piedimonte, sempre Garibaldini|url=http://www.altaterradilavoro.com/la-legione-del-matese-e-loccupazione-di-piedimonte-sempre-garibaldini/|website=Alta Terra Di Lavoro|accessdate=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This early defeat prepared the Garibaldian Army for the following battle.

===Battle of Piedimonte===
The Garibaldian Column, guided by Csudafy, entered Piedimonte Matese on the night of 22 September 1860 to assist the legion with this battle. The Bourbon army consisted of 3000 men and 3 cannons, while the Garibaldians had only approximately 200 men. The latter were forced to find refuge in the [[Matese]] mountains, leaving the city to the enemy, who successfully conquered it on 25 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tamasi|first1=Pierpaolo|title=Beniamino Caso|url=http://caipmatese.altervista.org/beniamino-caso.html|website=CAI Piedimonte Matese|accessdate=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle of Volturnus===
The [[Battle of the Volturnus (1860)]] refers to a series of military clashes between Garibaldi's volunteers and the troops of the [[Kingdom of Two Sicilies]]. It occurred around the river [[Volturno]], in [[Capua]], situated in the [[province of Caserta]] in northern [[Campania]], between 26 September and 2 October 1860.  The success of the Garibaldian troops in liberating Piedimonte was evidenced in the battle, where 191 volunteers of the Matese Legion participated, under the command of Major Guadagni.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Guadagni|title=Guadagno Guadagni and the Battle of Volturno|url=http://www.guadagnifamily.com/history/volturno.html|website=Guadagnifamily.com|publisher=WWW.GuadagniFamily.com.|accessdate=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle of Isernia===
Following the Battle of Volturnus, the 180 surviving members of the Matese Legion prepared to return to battle against some bourbons troops that were based in Isernia. On 15 October they joined an army led by the Colonel [[Francesco Nullo]], which consisted of 1160 volunteers. They began to move towards [[Isernia]] with the aim of conquering the city and, in this way, be the advance guard of the Garibaldian army in the region. Colonel Nullo was confident in the power of his army, but on 17 October they were defeated by the enemy, with 64 dead and 95 prisoners. The Matese Legion lost approximately thirty soldiers.&lt;ref name=foo /&gt;

==End of the Matese Legion==
Following the end of the war for Italian Unification, all volunteers were released from service following a decree by  [[Victor Emmanuel II]]. On 3 March 1861, the Matese Legion reunited for the last time in [[Caserta]] in front of the Mayor Giuliano Amato Giaquinto, in order to return their weapons. Colonel Francesco Materazzo asked the members to join the newly formed Italian army, but all declined the offer and disbanded.

==Significant People==
[[File:Beniamino Caso.jpg|thumb|Beniamino Caso|left|179x179px]]

The Matese Legion was founded by Beniamino Caso and Bonaventura Campagnano, who were in charge of recruiting all the volunteers in the district and in other localities within the province. The fighters recognized Beniamino Caso and Salvatore Pizzi as the leaders of the insurrectionary movement in [[Terra di Lavoro]].

Giuliano Iannotta was the Capitan of the Matese Legion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=La Legione del Matese|url=http://pm2010.altervista.org/legionematese.pdf|website=pm10.altervista|accessdate=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Giuseppe de Blasiis was the Duce sent from Comitato dell'Ordine, tasked with supervising the Matese Legion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=De Cesare|first1=R.|title=La fine di un Regno|date=1900|publisher=Città di Castello S. Lapi Tipografo-Editore|pages=333–361}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Giuliano Iannotta directed the volunteers during the Battle of Volturnus on 1 October 1860, and kept a journal detailing the events of the battle. During this battle the legion was commanded by a Florentine officer, Major Guadagno Guadagni.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Del Monaco|first1=Aurora|title=Centonovantuno cappotti.

The established young painter [[Gioacchino Toma]] was a member of the legion.

==The Matese Legion Today==
[[File:Matese legion today.jpg|thumb|289x289px|The Matese Legion Today]]"First Matese Legion" is an historical Garibaldine association that commemorates the Legion by re-enacting important historical events.

&lt;nowiki&gt; &lt;/nowiki&gt;They stage events in cities across Italy, particularly in Rome, in order to share the history and spread awareness and knowledge the Matese Legion. The Matese Legion's flag was preserved, and is stored in the museum of Piedimonte Matese. There is a commemorative tombstone where there are the names of the most important members of the legion. This is located in the town hall and every year on 4 November the Mayor, followed by a parade, places a crown under the tombstone.
The city of Piedimonte Matese is deeply entwined with legion, with many streets named after important members, such as Pietro Romagnoli and the bishop Gennaro di Giacomo, both of whom played an important role in encouraging the formation of the legion. The founder of the legion, Beniamino Caso, is commemorated in Piedimonte Matese in various ways. There is a palace which carries his name, where an epigraph testifies to the formation of the legion in this particular palace on 25 August 1860. Additionally, in [[San Gregorio Matese]], his native town, the major square is called "Piazza Beniamino Caso".&lt;ref name="foo"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Costarella|first1=Attilio|title=I Fatti di Piedimonte del 1860-1861|date=1988|publisher=La Bodonnia|location=Piedimonte Matese|accessdate=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ErtmanPenaTogether.png|thumb|Elizabeth Peña and Jennifer Ertman]]

The '''rape and murder of Jennifer Ertman and Elizabeth Peña''', two teenage girls from [[Houston, Texas]], aged 14 and 16, respectively, occurred on June 24, 1993. The murder of the two girls made [[headline]]s in Texas newspapers due to the nature of the crime and the new law resulting from the murder that allows families of the victims to view the execution of the murderers. The case was also notable in that the state of Texas rejected attempts by the [[International Court of Justice]] to halt the executions of several of the perpetrators.

==Murder==
On June 24, 1993, Jennifer Lee Ertman (August 15, 1978 – June 24, 1993) and Elizabeth Christine Peña (June 21, 1977 – June 24, 1993), [[Waltrip High School]] students, were attending the pool party of a friend who lived in the Spring Hill Apartments. When the pair realized that they were going to be late returning home, they decided to leave the party in order to meet an 11 p.m. [[curfew]]. Ertman and Peña decided to take a 10-minute shortcut to Peña's residence in [[Oak Forest, Houston|Oak Forest]] by following the railroad tracks and then passing through T.C. Jester Park.&lt;ref name="Turner"&gt;Turner, Allan. [http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/5922356.html "Medellin set to die Tuesday for Ertman-Peña killings"], ''[[Houston Chronicle]]''. August 4, 2008; retrieved March 6, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The girls were walking along the [[White Oak Bayou]] when they encountered "Black and White" [[Gangs in the United States|gang members]] drinking beer after holding a gang initiation.&lt;ref name="Graczyk"&gt;Graczyk, Michael. {{cite web|url=http://www.mysanantonio.com/sharedcontent/APStories/stories/D8IP87704.html |title="Convicted killer of teenage Houston girls set to die." |accessdate=2010-03-06 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929111613/http://www.mysanantonio.com/sharedcontent/APStories/stories/D8IP87704.html |archivedate=September 29, 2007 |df= }} ''[[Associated Press]]'' at ''MySanAntonio.com'', July 10, 2006; retrieved June 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The gang captured Peña, and Ertman had initially escaped but was captured after she ran back to help her friend when she screamed. The six gang members raped the girls repeatedly. After realizing that the girls might identify them, Peter Anthony Cantu,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarkprosecutor.org/html/death/US/cantu1224.htm Clarkprosecutor.org: Peter Anthony Cantu]- Reviewed 2017-05-07&lt;/ref&gt; a leader of the gang, ordered the members to kill the girls, so the members strangled them to death.&lt;ref name="Turner"/&gt; Derrick Sean O'Brien and Raul Omar Villarreal&lt;ref&gt;[http://murderpedia.org/male.V/v/villarreal-raul-omar.htm murderpedia.org: Raul Omar Villarreal]- Reviewed 2017-05-07&lt;/ref&gt; strangled Ertman with a red nylon belt before the belt broke; then the gang members used shoelaces.&lt;ref name="Turner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Graczyk"/&gt; Cantu, José Medellín, and Efrain Perez strangled Peña with shoelaces. The members then stomped on the girls' throats to ensure their deaths.&lt;ref name="Turner"/&gt;

Cantu, Medellín, Perez, and Villareal then congregated at Cantu's residence, where he lived with his brother, Joe Cantu, and sister-in-law, Christina Cantu. Christina Cantu questioned why Villareal was bleeding and Perez had a bloody shirt. This prompted Medellín to say the gang "had fun," and that details would appear on the news. He then elaborated that he had raped both girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/5924476.html|title=Medellin executed for rape, murder of Houston teens|authors=Allan Turner, Rosanna Ruiz|publisher=''[[Houston Chronicle]]''|date=August 6, 2008|accessdate=July 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Peter Cantu then returned, and divided valuables that had been stolen from the girls. José Medellín got a ring with an "E", so he could give it to his girlfriend, Esther. Medellín reported that he had killed a girl, and noted that he would have found it easier with a gun. O'Brien was videotaped smiling at the scene of the crime. After the gang left, Christina Cantu convinced Joe Cantu to report the crime to police.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarkprosecutor.org/html/death/US/medellin1116.htm Murder of Jennifer Ertman and Elizabeth Peña], clarkprosecutor.org; accessed June 4, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Four days after the crime, the bodies were found in the park during hot weather conditions. They were badly decaying, and dental records were used for identification. The medical examiner corroborated that the cause of death was strangulation. All those believed responsible were ultimately arrested. Medellín gave both a written and taped confession.&lt;ref name="FOX"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,300686,00.html|title=Father of Murdered Girl Questions Bush's Support to Halt Killer's Execution|publisher=FOX News|date=October 10, 2007|accessdate=2008-08-07|first=Melissa|last=Underwood}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AG"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oag.state.tx.us/oagNews/release.php?id=2571 |title=Media Advisory: Jose Medellin Scheduled For Execution |publisher=Attorney General of Texas |date=July 29, 2008 |accessdate=2008-08-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080813155334/http://www.oag.state.tx.us/oagnews/release.php?id=2571 |archivedate=August 13, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=861&amp;dat=19940214&amp;id=9zdOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=6UoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5204,2956219|title=San Antonio turned from bully to savage killer|date=February 14, 1994|work=The Victoria Advocate|access-date=June 18, 2017|agency=Associated Press|page=5A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sentencing, incarceration, and executions==
{{See also|Medellín v. Texas}}
[[File:EllisUnitTX.jpg|thumb|[[Ellis Unit]], where the death row perpetrators were initially confined]]
At sentencing, the offenders were remanded to the [[Texas Department of Criminal Justice]] (TDCJ) system. Peter Anthony Cantu, [[José Medellín|José Ernesto Medellín]], Derrick Sean O'Brien, Efrain Perez, and Raul Omar Villareal received [[death sentences]]. Venancio Medellín, the brother of José Medellín, was 14 at the time of the murder, the same age as Jennifer Ertman. Venancio received a 40-year prison sentence. When the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] banned the executions of people who committed crimes while they were below 18 years of age, the sentences of Perez and Villareal were automatically commuted to life in prison.&lt;ref name="Graczyk"/&gt; O'Brien, an African-American and the only non-Hispanic in the gang, was the first to be executed, in July 2006. O'Brien was buried in the [[Captain Joe Byrd Cemetery]] in [[Huntsville, Texas]].&lt;ref name="Turner"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ross&gt;Ross, Robyn. [http://www.texasobserver.org/prison-inmates-laid-rest-huntsville/ Laid to Rest in Huntsville] ([https://www.webcitation.org/6O5y8wa3H?url=http://www.texasobserver.org/prison-inmates-laid-rest-huntsville/ Archive]) ''[[Texas Observer]]''. Tuesday, March 11, 2014; retrieved March 16, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

José Ernesto Medellín appealed his execution, saying that he had informed City of Houston and Harris County police officers that he was a Mexican citizen, and that he had been unable to confer with Mexican consular officials. The prosecutors said that Medellín never told authorities that he was a Mexican citizen. Medellín said in a sworn statement that he learned that the Mexican consulate could assist him in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[https://law.justia.com/cases/texas/court-of-criminal-appeals/2006/ap-75207-4.html ''law.justia.com'']&lt;/ref&gt; He petitioned the [[Texas Court of Criminal Appeals]] in 1998 regarding this issue; the appeal failed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/06-984 ''law.cornell.edu'']&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:PolunskyUnitWestLivingstonTX.jpg|thumb|left|The perpetrators who were under death sentences were later moved to the [[Allan B. Polunsky Unit]]]]
Medellín's impending execution became an international controversy, since the state did not hold a hearing about whether the inability for Medellín to meet with Mexican consular officials harmed his defense. The right of a defendant to talk with his or her consulate is specified in the [[Vienna Convention on Consular Relations]]; the United States is a party to the convention, although the U.S. withdrew from compulsory jurisdiction in 1986 to accept the court's jurisdiction only on a case-by-case basis.&lt;ref&gt;Churchill, Ward. ''A Little Matter of Genocide'', San Francisco: City Lights Books, 1997.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 the [[International Court of Justice]] responded to a lawsuit filed by Mexico against the United States; the court ordered hearings to be held for inmates, including Medellín, who were denied consular rights.&lt;ref&gt;[https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/supreme-court-review/2008/9/medellinshapiro_0.pdf ''object.cato.org'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, [[George W. Bush|President George W. Bush]] ordered hearings to be held. The State of Texas, represented by Solicitor General [[Ted Cruz]], challenged Bush's order, and the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that only the [[Congress of the United States]] has the right to order hearings to be held. In July, the World Court ordered a stay of Medellín's execution. [[Governor of Texas|Governor]] [[Rick Perry]] argued that Texas is not bound to World Court rulings. Death penalty opponents protested the impending execution. The families of both Ertman and Peña strongly favored the execution(s).&lt;ref name="Turner"/&gt;
[[File:HuntsvilleUnitHuntsvilleTX.jpg|thumb|[[Huntsville Unit]], the site of executions in the State of Texas]]

Randy Ertman (1952 - 2014), father of Jennifer Ertman, wanted to have Andy Kahan, the City of Houston's crime advocate, witness the execution of Medellín. TDCJ refused to permit Kahan to witness the execution.&lt;ref&gt;Vogel, Chris.

==Aftermath==
The parents of the murder victims successfully advocated for the State of Texas allowing relatives of victims to have permission to witness executions.&lt;ref name="Graczyk"/&gt; Before the murders, [[City of Houston]] officials had stated that gangs were not a significant issue in the city. C.E. Anderson, a [[Houston Police Department]] officer who worked on the murder case, described the murder as "part of the impetus for the anti-gang programs in Houston." Jennifer Latson of the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' said that the deaths of the girls "shook" the [[Oak Forest, Houston|Oak Forest]] neighborhood of Houston "to its foundation."&lt;ref name="LatsonSomber"&gt;Latson, Jennifer.

The '''New Year Sprint''' (formerly the '''Powderhall Sprint''') is the name of a handicap sprint race for professional athletes that takes place each year in Scotland. The sprint is one of the original events of this type, tracing its history back to 1870.

== Origins ==

The race was originally called the Powderhall Sprint after the [[Powderhall|district]] of [[Edinburgh]] where it first took place.&lt;ref name="Scotsman"&gt;http://www.scotsman.com/sport/more-sport/athletics/powderhall-athletics-tradition-a-tribute-to-champion-1-3251446 "Powderhall athletics tradition a tribute to champion", Sandy Sutherland, The Scotsman, 13 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Powderhall Sprint was one of a circuit of professional handicap sprint races that prospered in the late nineteenth century in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="history"&gt;http://www.sportingworld.co.uk/newyearsprint/briefhistory_20.html Brief History, The New Year Sprint and Supporting Events, www.newyearsprint.com. Retrieved 13 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The handicap system meant the highly rated runners ran longer distance than the less highly rated runners - the handicap being determined by previous results.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; Those runners that had to run the full distance, the most highly rated, were running from 'scratch'. A huge amount of betting surrounded all the professional races and they were often shrouded in allegations of fraud to ensure a winner favourable to the bookmakers.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

The race later moved from Powderhall to the [[Meadowbank Stadium]] in Edinburgh and then onto [[Musselburgh Racecourse]].&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2011/dec/22/powderhall-sprint-professional-running "Days of bookies, fast bucks and foot soldiers at the Powderhall Sprint", Harry Pearson, The Guardian, 22 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/powderhall-sprint-finds-new-home-at-musselburgh-but-controversy-rages-over-record-prize-sparks-fly-after-pitt-races-off-with-title-1.255622 "'Powderhall Sprint' finds new home at Musselburgh", Doug Gillon, HeraldScotland, 30 December 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The move, in 1971, to the [[Meadowbank Stadium]] happened after the newly opened venue had hosted the [[1970 Commonwealth Games]]. The Powderhall Stadium had hosted the Powderhall Sprint uninterrupted, including through two world wars, since 1870, apart from a brief break in 1953 and between 1958 and 1964 when various venues in Scotland hosted the race. In 1999, the race moved to Musselburgh Racecourse.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shga.co.uk/news.php?a=341 "The Powderhall Sprint [a unique event]", Shane Fenton, Scottish Highland Games Association, 29 December 2013. Retrieved 17 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Present Race ==

The present race is run at [[Musselburgh Racecourse]] and is now run over 110 meters, with the winner receiving GBP£4,000.&lt;ref name="Scotsman"/&gt;

In 1993, amateur athletes were allowed to compete for the first time without the risk of losing their amateur status.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

== Famous Competitors ==

The New Year Sprint in its various incarnations has attracted many of the world's top sprinters.

During the [[First World War]], it attracted the great Australian sprinter [[Jack Donaldson (athlete)|Jack Donaldson]] and British Olympic medal winner [[Willie Applegarth]].

Willie McFarlane won the race 2 years in succession in 1933 and 1934, the latter from scratch- a record that still stands.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sportingworld.co.uk/newyearsprint/briefhistory_23.html,&lt;/ref&gt;
in 1951, Geoff Harrington from Brownhills won the race, beating Eric Cumming, and beating the 150-year-old record with a time of 11.5 seconds
In 1952, the great Australian sprinter [[Eric Cumming]] was champion and the American Olympian [[Barney Ewell]] was a competitor.

In 1970, the winner was [[George McNeill (sprinter)|George McNeill]] who is the holder of the world professional 120 yards record.

In 1987, the former United States collegiate 200 m champion [[William Snoddy (sprinter)|William Snoddy]] won.

'''Orenthal James Simpson''' (born July 9, 1947), nicknamed '''The Juice''', is an American former [[running back]], broadcaster, actor, advertising spokesman, and convicted robber.

Simpson attended the [[University of Southern California]] (USC), where he played football for the [[USC Trojans football|USC Trojans]] and won the [[Heisman Trophy]] in 1968. He played professionally as a [[running back]] in the NFL for 11 seasons, primarily with the [[Buffalo Bills]] from 1969 to 1977. He also played for the [[San Francisco 49ers]] from 1978 to 1979. In 1973, he became the first NFL player to [[Rush (gridiron football)|rush]] for more than [[2,000-yard club|2,000 yards]] in a season. He holds the record for the single season yards-per-game average, which stands at 143.1. He is the only player to ever rush for over 2,000 yards in the 14-game regular season NFL format.

Simpson was inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] in 1983 and the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in 1985. After retiring from football, he began new careers in acting and football broadcasting.

In 1994, Simpson was arrested and charged with the murders of his ex-wife, [[Nicole Brown Simpson]], and her friend, [[Ron Goldman]]. He was acquitted by a jury after a [[O. J. Simpson murder case|lengthy and internationally publicized trial]]. The families of the victims subsequently filed a civil suit against him, and in 1997 a [[Civil law (common law)|civil court]] awarded a $33.5&amp;nbsp;million judgment against him for the victims' [[Wrongful death claim|wrongful death]]s.

In 2007, Simpson was arrested in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], and charged with the [[felonies]] of armed robbery and kidnapping.&lt;ref name="arrest"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/oj/nvoj91607arrstrpt.html |title=O.J.

==College football and athletics career==
Although Simpson was an All-City football player at Galileo, his mediocre high-school grades prevented him from attracting the interest of many college recruiters. After a childhood friend's injury in the [[Vietnam War]] influenced Simpson to stay out of the military, he enrolled at [[City College of San Francisco]] in 1965.&lt;ref name="cahill19770908"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Cahill |first=Tim |date=1977-09-08 |title=O.J.

Simpson chose to attend the [[USC Trojans football|University of Southern California]] (USC), which he had admired as a young football fan,{{r|cahill19770908}} over the [[Utah Utes football|University of Utah]] and played running back for head coach [[John McKay (American football)|John McKay]] in [[1967 USC Trojans football team|1967]] and [[1968 USC Trojans football team|1968]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.blocku.com/2012/7/8/3146029/o-j-utah-the-heisman-and-a-long-winding-what-if|title=O.J., Utah, the Heisman and a long, winding what if|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simpson led the nation in rushing both years under McKay: in [[1967 college football season|1967]] with 1,543 yards and 13 touchdowns, and in [[1968 college football season|1968]] with 1,880 yards on 383 carries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/oj-simpson-1.html |title=O.J. Simpson College Stats |publisher=[[Sports Reference]] |accessdate=January 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a junior in 1967, Simpson was a close runner-up in the Heisman Trophy [[1967 college football season#Heisman Trophy|balloting]] to quarterback [[Gary Beban]] of [[1967 UCLA Bruins football team|UCLA]].

Simpson starred in the un-televised two-hour-long [[film pilot]] for ''Frogmen,'' an ''[[The A-Team|A-Team]]''-like adventure series that [[Warner Bros. Television]] completed in 1994, a few months before the murders. NBC had not yet decided whether to order the series when Simpson's arrest cancelled the project. While searching his home, the police obtained a videotaped copy of the pilot as well as the script and [[dailies]]. Although the prosecution investigated reports that Simpson, who played the leader of a group of former [[United States Navy SEALs]], received "a fair amount of" military training—including use of a knife—for ''Frogmen,'' and there is a scene in which he holds a knife to the throat of a woman, this material was not introduced as evidence during the trial.&lt;ref name="lowry20000508"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/print/2000/may/08/entertainment/ca-27673 | title=The Saga of O.J.'s Last, Lost Pilot | accessdate=April 5, 2011 | author=Lowry, Brian | date=May 8, 2000 |work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NBC executive [[Warren Littlefield]] said in July 1994 that the network would probably never air the pilot if Simpson were convicted; if he were acquitted, however, one television journalist speculated that "''Frogmen'' would probably be on the air before the [[NBC peacock]] could unfurl its plume".&lt;ref name="jicha19940727"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1994-07-27/lifestyle/9407260286_1_littlefield-tv-movie-simpson-case | title=NBC May Bury Simpson TV Movie At Sea | work=Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel | date=July 27, 1994 | accessdate=April 24, 2014 | author=Jicha, Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most pilots that are two hours long are aired as [[TV movie]]s whether or not they are ordered as series. Because—as the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' later reported—"the appetite for all things O.J. appeared insatiable" during the trial, Warner Bros. and NBC estimated that a gigantic, [[Super Bowl]]-like television audience would have watched the ''Frogmen'' film. Co-star [[Evan Handler]] said that the studio's decision not to air it or release it on home video, and forego an estimated $14&amp;nbsp;million in profits, was "just about the only proof you have that there is some dignity in the advertising and television business".&lt;ref name="lowry20000508"/&gt;

===''Juiced''===
In 2006, Simpson starred in his own [[Improvisational theatre|improv]], hidden-camera prank TV show, ''Juiced.'' Typical of the genre, Simpson would play a prank on everyday people while secretly filming them and at the end of each prank, he would shout, "You've been Juiced!" Less typical, each episode opened with topless strippers dancing around Simpson, who is dressed as a pimp. He sings his own rap song, which includes the lyrics "Don't you know there's no stopping the Juice / When I'm on the floor I'm like a lion on the loose / Better shoot me with a tranquilizer dart / Don't be stupid, I'm not a Simpson named Bart." In one episode, Simpson is at a used car lot in Las Vegas where he attempts to sell his white Bronco (made famous during the chase in Los Angeles prior to his arrest). A bullet hole in the front of the SUV is circled with his autograph, and he pitches it to a prospective buyer by saying that if they "ever get into some trouble and have to get away, it has escapability."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vogue.com/13393604/remembering-oj-simpsons-bizarre-prank-tv-show |title=Remembering O.J.

Later he transforms into an old white man whose dying wish is to call a game of bingo. ''Juiced'' aired as a one-time special on pay-per-view television and was later released on DVD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Fallon| first=Kevin| title=Remember When O.J.

==Endorsements==
In 1975, ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine described Simpson as "the first black athlete to become a bona fide lovable media superstar."&lt;ref name="goodman19751013"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Goodman |first=Mark |date=1975-10-13 |title=Buffalo Turns on the Juice, and O.J.

He also appeared in comic book ads for Dingo [[cowboy boots]].

==Family life==
[[File:O.J. Simpson (1986)2.JPG|thumb|upright|Simpson with his daughter, Sydney Brooke in 1986]]
At age 19 on June 24, 1967, Simpson married Marguerite L. Whitley. Together, they had three children: Arnelle L. Simpson (b. 1968), Jason L. Simpson (b. 1970), and Aaren Lashone Simpson (1977–1979). In August 1979, Aaren drowned in the family's swimming pool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=alYnAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=bnwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6787,3455914&amp;dq=aaren+simpson&amp;hl=en |title=Simpson's youngest daughter dies after 8 days in coma |date=August 28, 1979 |work=[[Tampa Bay Times|St. Petersburg Times]] |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=January 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espn.com/sportscentury/features/00016477.html |title=L.A. story |last=Schwartz |first=Larry |website=[[ESPN.com]] |accessdate=January 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman murders and trials===
{{main article|O. J. Simpson murder case}}

====Criminal trial for murder====
[[File:Mug shot of O.J. Simpson.jpg|thumb|upright|Simpson's mugshot, 17 June 1994]]
On June 12, 1994, Nicole Brown Simpson and [[Ron Goldman]] were found stabbed to death outside Nicole's [[condominium]] in the [[Brentwood, Los Angeles|Brentwood]] area of Los Angeles. Simpson was a [[person of interest]] in their murders. Simpson did not turn himself in, and on June 17 he became the object of a low-speed pursuit in a white 1993 [[Ford Bronco]] [[SUV]] owned and driven by [[Al Cowlings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/18/us/the-simpson-case-the-fugitive-simpson-is-charged-chased-arrested.html|title=The Fugitive: Simpson Is Charged, Chased, Arrested|last=Mydans|first=Seth|date=18 June 1994|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;    TV stations interrupted coverage of the [[1994 NBA Finals]] to broadcast the incident live.  With an estimated audience of 95 million people, the event was described as "the most famous ride on American shores since [[Paul Revere]]'s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xdbQMywnrdwC&amp;pg=PA174&amp;dq=Simpson+Bronco+most+famous+ride+since+Paul+Revere|title=Crimes of the century: from Leopold and Loeb to O.J.

The trial, often characterized as the [[Trial of the Century]] because of its international publicity similar to that of [[Sacco and Vanzetti]] and the [[Lindbergh kidnapping]], culminated after eleven months on October 3, 1995, when the jury rendered a verdict of "not guilty" for the two murders. An estimated 100 million people nationwide tuned in to watch or listen to the verdict announcement.&lt;ref name=dershowitz2004&gt;{{cite book|title=America on trial: inside the legal battles that transformed our nation|last=Dershowitz|first=Alan M.|authorlink=Alan Dershowitz|isbn=0-446-52058-6|date=May 2004|page=514|publisher=[[Warner Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Simpson's acquittal, no additional arrests or convictions related to the murders were made.

Immediate reaction to the verdict was notable for its division along racial lines: a poll of [[Los Angeles County]] residents showed that most African Americans there felt that justice had been served by the "not guilty" verdict, while the majority of whites and Latinos expressed an opinion that it had not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Decker|first1=Cathleen|title=THE TIMES POLL : Most in County Disagree With Simpson Verdicts|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-10-08/news/mn-54801_1_times-poll|accessdate=January 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; O. J. Simpson's integrated defense counsel included [[Johnnie Cochran]], [[Robert Kardashian]], [[Robert Shapiro (lawyer)|Robert Shapiro]], and [[F. Lee Bailey]]. [[Marcia Clark]] was the lead prosecutor for the State of California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Toobin|first1=Jeffrey|title=True Grit|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1995/01/09/true-grit|accessdate=24 October 2016|work=[[The New Yorker]]|date=9 January 2016|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/work/oj-simpson-prosecutor-his-murder-trial-ruined-my-life---but-20-y/|title=O.J.Simpson prosecutor: 'His murder trial ruined my life - but 20 years on I'm back'|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=18 March 2016|accessdate=24 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2016 poll, 83% of white Americans and 57% of black Americans believe Simpson was guilty of the murders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/25/black-and-white-americans-can-now-agree-o-j-was-guilty/ |title=Two decades later, black and white Americans finally agree on O.J.

&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wrongful death civil trial====
Following Simpson's acquittal of criminal charges, Ron Goldman's family filed a civil lawsuit against Simpson. [[Daniel Petrocelli]] represented plaintiff Fred Goldman (Ronald Goldman's father), while Robert Baker represented Simpson.&lt;ref name="Civil Case"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9609/16/simpson.case/|publisher=CNN|title=The O.J. Simpson Civil Case|date=September 16, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Superior Court Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki presided,&lt;ref name="Civil Case" /&gt; and he barred television and still cameras, radio equipment, and courtroom sketch artists from the courtroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9608/23/simpson.cameras/index.html|publisher=CNN|title=Judge bars cameras in courtroom for Simpson civil trial|date=August 23, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 23, 1996, opening statements were made, and on January 16, 1997, both sides rested their cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Timeline-OJ-Simpson-Murder-Civil-Trials-262363251.html|publisher=NBC Southern California|title=Timeline: OJ Simpson Murder, Civil Trials|date=June 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 5, 1997, a civil jury in [[Santa Monica, California]] unanimously found Simpson liable for the [[Wrongful death claim|wrongful death]] of and battery against Goldman, and battery against Brown. Simpson was ordered to pay $33,500,000 in damages. In February 1999, an auction of Simpson's [[Heisman Trophy]] and other belongings netted almost $500,000, which went to the Goldman family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,615340,00.html|publisher=People|title=O.J.'S Heisman Sold|date=April 22, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Goldman family also tried to collect Simpson's [[NFL]] $28,000 yearly pension&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/writers/michael_mccann/09/18/hearings|publisher=CNN|title=No easy answers|date=September 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; but failed to collect any money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Judge Rules Simpson's Mother Can Keep Piano|url=http://www.courttv.com/casefiles/simpson/ojsimpson.html|date=September 30, 1997|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213051600/http://www.courttv.com/casefiles/simpson/ojsimpson.html|archivedate=February 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Simpson was evicted from the estate in which he had lived for 20 years, at 360 North Rockingham Avenue, after defaulting on the mortgage. In July 1998, the house was demolished by its next owner, Kenneth Abdalla, an investment banker and president of the [[Jerry's Famous Deli]] chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Chicago Tribune|title=New Owner Demolishes O.J.

Simpson estate|website=Google Maps|accessdate= April 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2000 ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' article reported that Simpson still made a significant income by signing autographs. He subsequently moved from California to [[Florida]], settling in [[Miami]]. In Florida, among a few states, a person's residence cannot be seized to collect a debt under most circumstances.

On September 5, 2006, Goldman's father took Simpson back to court to obtain control over Simpson's "right to publicity", for purposes of satisfying the judgment in the civil court case.&lt;ref name="spending"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070305235730/http://www.cnn.com/2007/LAW/02/08/simpson.lawsuit.ap/index.html "O.J.

May 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; On January 4, 2007, a federal judge issued a [[restraining order]] prohibiting Simpson from spending any advance he may have received on a canceled book deal and TV interview about the 1994 murders. The matter was dismissed before trial for lack of jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="spending" /&gt; On January 19, 2007, a California state judge issued an additional restraining order, ordering Simpson to restrict his spending to "ordinary and necessary living expenses".&lt;ref name="spending" /&gt;

On March 13, 2007, a judge prevented Simpson from receiving any further compensation from the defunct book deal and TV interview, and the judge ordered the bundled book rights to be auctioned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2007/3/14/102934.shtml "Judge Keeps O.J.

In the late 1990s, Simpson attempted to register "O. J. Simpson", "O. J.", and "The Juice" as trademarks for "a broad range of goods, including figurines, trading cards, sportswear, medallions, coins, and prepaid telephone cards".&lt;ref&gt;''Ritchie v. Simpson'', 170 F.3D 1092 (C.A.F.C., 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; A "concerned citizen", William B. Ritchie, sued to oppose the granting of federal registration on the grounds that doing so would be immoral and scandalous. Simpson gave up the effort in 2000.

In February 2001, Simpson was arrested in [[Miami-Dade County, Florida]], for simple battery and burglary of an occupied conveyance, for yanking the glasses off another motorist during a traffic dispute three months earlier. If convicted, Simpson could have faced up to 16 years in prison, but he was tried and quickly acquitted of both charges in October 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/jury-clears-oj-simpson-of-roadrage-charges-632646.html|title= Jury clears O.J.

On December 4, 2001, Simpson's Miami home was searched by the FBI on suspicion of [[MDMA|ecstasy]] possession and [[money laundering]]. The FBI had received a tip that Simpson was involved in a major drug trafficking ring after 10 other suspects were arrested in the case. Simpson's home was thoroughly searched for two hours, but no illegal drugs were discovered, and no arrest or formal charges were filed following the search. However, investigators uncovered equipment capable of stealing satellite television programming, which eventually led to Simpson's being sued in federal court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2000/06/06/national/main202915.shtml|title=O.J.

In March 2004, satellite television network [[DirecTV]], Inc. accused Simpson in a Miami federal court of using illegal electronic devices to [[piracy|pirate]] its broadcast signals.

After the hearings, the judge ordered that Simpson be tried for the robbery.

On November 8, 2007, Simpson had a preliminary hearing to decide whether he would be tried for the charges. He was held over for trial on all 12 counts. Simpson pleaded not guilty on November 29, and the trial was reset from April to September 8, 2008.&lt;ref name="jurors"&gt;[http://www.newsmax.com/us/oj_simpson/2008/05/22/98327.html "400 jurors could be screened for OJ Simpson trial."]{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}} ''Newsmax''.

A hearing took place on January 16, 2008.

'''One Last Tour''' was a worldwide [[farewell tour]] by [[Sweden|Swedish]] electronic dance trio [[Swedish House Mafia]] following the announcement of their break-up in June 2012. The tour took place through November 2012 to March 2013.

==Itinerary==
On September 24, 2012, Swedish House Mafia announced the dates for their farewell tour appropriately named "One Last Tour". The tour kicked off in November 2012 and concluded in March 2013. Due to extremely high demand, additional shows were added, and the group made their final appearance at the [[Ultra Music Festival]] with an opening and closing set on March 15 and March 24, 2013, respectively. A note was written and shown at the end of their final performance, with an acapella performance of their final single "[[Don't You Worry Child]]".

The '''P-Funk Earth Tour''' was a series of [[concert]]s performed by [[Parliament-Funkadelic]] in the mid-1970s, featuring absurd costumes, lavish staging and special effects, and music from both the [[Parliament (band)|Parliament]] and [[Funkadelic]] repertoires.

The P-Funk Earth Tour was ambitious from the start.  [[Casablanca Records]] executive [[Neil Bogart]] gave [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]] a $275,000 budget for production, the largest amount ever allocated for a black music act to tour.&lt;ref name=vincent&gt;{{cite book | last=Vincent | first=Rickey | title=Funk: The Music, the People, and the Rhythm of the One | publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] | year=1996 | isbn=0-312-13499-1}} p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt;  Clinton hired Jules Fischer as [[set design]]er, who had previously worked on tours for [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Kiss (band)|KISS]], and other rock bands.&lt;ref name=vincent/&gt;&lt;ref name=thompson&gt;{{cite book | last=Thompson | first=Dave | title=Funk | publisher=[[Backbeat Books]] | year=2001 | isbn=0-87930-629-7}} p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;  Both the show's music and production elements were extensively rehearsed at an [[aircraft hangar]] in [[Newburgh, New York]].&lt;ref name=vincent/&gt;&lt;ref name=thompson/&gt;  The show required seven trucks to transport its equipment and scenery.&lt;ref name=thompson/&gt; With a broad range of themes embodied in the show's production, culminating in the [[Afrofuturism|Afrofuturist]] landing of the [[P-Funk Mothership]], author [[Rickey Vincent]] states that the P-Funk Earth Tour "drew from the ribald, uncensored entirety of the black tradition in mind-blowing ways no one had yet even attempted."&lt;ref name=vincent/&gt;  ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' viewed the tour as embracing Clinton's "semiserious funk mythology" with "[a] mixture of tribal funk, elaborate stage props and the relentless assault on personal inhibition [that] resembled nothing so much as a Space Age Mardi Gras."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=McEwen | first=Joe | chapter=Funk | title=The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock &amp; Roll | publisher=[[Random House]]/[[Rolling Stone Press]] | location=New York | year=1980 | isbn=0-394-73938-8}} p. 375.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The New York Times]]'' described the tour as featuring "superbly silly, lavish costumes" and an "opulent Baroque ... stage show".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F40812F6355D167493C3A9178CD85F438785F9 | title=The Pop Life: A Secular Niche For Gospel and 'Jesus Rock' | author=[[John Rockwell]] | publisher=[[The New York Times]] | date=1977-07-01 | accessdate=2007-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tour began in October 1976 in [[New Orleans]].&lt;ref name=vincent/&gt;
The 1977 [[live album]] ''[[Live: P-Funk Earth Tour]]'' was recorded at two early 1977 concerts, January 19 at the [[Los Angeles Forum]] and January 21 at the [[Oakland Coliseum]].&lt;ref name=vincent/&gt;
The tour drew to a close in mid-1977; its expenses were as high as its innovation level and it was losing money steadily;&lt;ref name=kempton&gt;{{cite book | last=Kempton | first=Arthur | title=Boogaloo: The Quintessence of American Popular Music | publisher=[[University of Michigan Press]] | year=2005 | isbn=0-472-03087-6}} pp. 380–381.&lt;/ref&gt; indeed one tour assistant's job was "to tell the musicians why they weren't getting paid."&lt;ref name=kempton/&gt;  Nevertheless, the tour served as valuable publicity and marketing for "the P-Funk brand",&lt;ref name=kempton/&gt; making reference to the greater Parliament-Funkadelic-Clinton enterprise of acts, records, side projects, spin-offs, and so forth.

'''Hammerstein's Roof Garden''' (1899 – 1915) was the official name the semi-outdoor [[vaudeville]] venue that theatre magnate, [[Oscar Hammerstein I]], built atop the [[Victoria Theater (Hammerstein's)|Victoria Theatre]] and the neighboring [[Theatre Republic]], commonly known then as the Belasco Theatre. Unlike Hammerstein’s first roof garden theatre, which crowned his failed [[Olympia Theatre (New York City)|Olympia Theatre]], the '''Paradise Roof Garden''' was able to rise to prominence and contend with its rivals for the better parts of two decades.&lt;ref&gt;Hoogstraten, Nicholas. Lost Broadway Theatres. New York: Princeton Architectural Press, 1997, 41-43.&lt;/ref&gt;  For [[New York City]] theatre-goers, the name ''Hammerstein’s'' grew to encompass both the Victoria and its roof garden.&lt;ref&gt;“Rialto Theatre to Close Tonight,” New York Times, 15 May 1935, 23.&lt;/ref&gt;
From 1904 to 1914 it was run by [[Willie Hammerstein]], who put on highly popular vaudeville acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv |last=Slide|first=Anthony|title=The Encyclopedia of Vaudeville|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hu3nNSmRjZ0C&amp;pg=PA227|accessdate=2014-05-18 |year=2012|publisher=Univ. Press of Mississippi|isbn=978-1-61703-250-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
The construction of the Victoria suffered from an anemic budget, and as a result, its roof garden developed incrementally. It opened in 1899 as the Venetian Terrace Roof Garden and featured a “‘grand promenade’ in the style of [[Monte Carlo]].”&lt;ref&gt;“The Roof Garden Season,” New York Times, 25 June 1899.&lt;/ref&gt; The middle of its three tiers consisted of boxes; the third, an open-air café. In compliance with the city’s building code, Hammerstein added eight exits and two elevators to his “solid steel and concrete construction” before summer season of 1902 commenced.&lt;ref&gt;“For Playgoing People,” New York Times, 25 May 1902.&lt;/ref&gt; He also gained permission to install a roof that could open or close to accommodate the weather.&lt;ref&gt;Cullen, Frank. Vaudeville Old and New: An Encyclopedia of Variety Performers in America, Vol 1. Abingdon: Routledge, 2007, 477.&lt;/ref&gt;

The bulk of the theatre rested over the Victoria, leaving the roof of the Belasco free for novelty features, including a pond, a Dutch-style dairy farm, and a windmill. The “Mute Revue” consisted of garden displays that paid tribute to the theatrical hits of the closing season.&lt;ref&gt;“Hammerstein’s Roof Opens,” New York Times, 4 June 1907.&lt;/ref&gt;  Just in time for the opening of the summer season of 1907, the entire venue was upgraded: the house was repainted in white and blue with splashes of red, and the boxes were remodeled and decked with geraniums.

==Variety and vaudeville==
In addition to entertainment, the open-air Paradise Roof Garden offered patrons escape from the city’s oppressive summer heat.&lt;ref&gt;Cullen, Frank. Vaudeville Old and New: An Encyclopedia of Variety Performers in America, Vol 1. Abingdon: Routledge, 2007, 477.&lt;/ref&gt; The table-and-chair seating configuration encouraged conversation in a house that was vulnerable to sunlight and outside noise; simple, wordless variety entertainment was well suited to such conditions. Some of the “dumb acts” that played on the roof included Barnold’s Dog and Monkey Pantomime Company,&lt;ref&gt;“Hammerstein’s Roof Opens,” New York Times, 4 June 1907.&lt;/ref&gt; and wire-walker [[Bird Millman]];&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Stephen Burge. The Roof Gardens of Broadway Theaters, 1883-1942. Ann Arbor, Michigan: UMI Research Press, 1985, 89, 157.&lt;/ref&gt; in fact, [[William Glackens]]’s painting, titled simply ''Hammerstein’s Roof Garden'', depicts such an act.&lt;ref&gt;Glackens, William J., Hammerstein’s Roof Garden. Oil on Canvas, circa 1901. Whitney Museum of Art.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demise==
As advancements in air-conditioning were rendering New York’s roof garden theatres obsolete, silent movies were luring patrons out of vaudeville theatres. With the selling of the Victoria in 1915, the roof garden closed as well.&lt;ref&gt;“Oscar in Three Reels,” New York Times, 5 April 1916.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1989-1106-405, Plauen, Demonstration vor dem Rathaus.jpg|thumb|300px|A demonstration on 30 October 1989 in front of [[Plauen]]'s [[town hall]] ]]
The '''Peaceful Revolution''' ({{lang-de|Friedliche Revolution}}) was the process of sociopolitical change that led to the end of the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]] (SED) in the [[German Democratic Republic]] (GDR or East Germany) and the transition to a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] which enabled the [[German reunification|reunification of Germany]]. This turning point was wholly created through the violence-free initiatives, protests, and successful demonstrations, which decisively occurred between the local elections held in May 1989 and the [[East German general election, 1990|GDR's first free parliamentary election in March 1990]].

These events were closely linked to the [[Soviet Union]]'s decision under the leadership of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] to abandon its hegemony in Eastern Europe as well as the [[Revolutions of 1989|reformist movements that spread through the region]] as a result. In addition to the Soviet Union's shift in foreign policy – part of its [[glasnost]] and [[perestroika]] reforms – the GDR's lack of competitiveness within an increasingly global market as well as its sharply rising national debt hastened the destabilization of the SED's [[one-party state]] and the success of the revolution.

Those driving the reform process within the GDR included intellectuals and church figures, who had been in underground opposition for several years, the significant amount of people attempting to flee the country – thus displaying a clear sign of the discontentment with the SED regime – as well as the rising number of peaceful demonstrators who were no longer willing to yield to the threat of violence and repression by the authorities.

On account of its hostile response to the reforms implemented within its "socialist brother lands", the SED leadership was already increasingly isolated within the [[Eastern Bloc]] by the time it finally decided to abstain from the use of force to suppress the ever-larger public demonstrations and permitted the opening of the border at the [[Berlin Wall]] on 9 November 1989. Through a change in leadership and a willingness to talk with opponents, the SED initially attempted to win back the political initiative. However, due to the continued political instability and the threat of national bankruptcy, control of the situation increasingly lay with the West German government under Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]].

From the start of December 1989, the GDR government of Prime Minister [[Hans Modrow]] was influenced from a Central Round Table, at which the dissolution of the suppressive state security service, the [[Stasi]], was put into action and preparations were made for free elections. After a sweeping and surprising election win{{efn|A clear win for the newly-founded [[Social Democratic Party in the GDR|Social Democratic Party]] was awaited according to the polls, and a strong result for the renamed [[Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)|Party of Democratic Socialism]] because of its advantage as long-governing party feared, while the conservative and liberal bloc parties had the flaw of decade-long opportunism.}} for the conservative and nationalist{{efn|in terms of categorically calling for [[German reunification]]}} "[[Alliance for Germany]]" coalition, the political path within the GDR was now clear for a swift reunification of the two German states.

==Soviet policy toward the Eastern Bloc==
A fundamental shift in the policy of the Soviet Union under [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] toward the [[Eastern Bloc]] nations was the background for large numbers of the East German population to show active dissent against [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|SED]] regime in the GDR.

Upon becoming elected General Secretary of the Soviet Union in 1985, Gorbachev abolished the Soviet claim of leadership over the internal developments of the "socialist brother lands". The [[Brezhnev Doctrine]] that had seen the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|Warsaw Pact invade Czechoslovakia in 1968]] to quell the [[Prague Spring]] liberal reforms was replaced by the so-called [[Sinatra Doctrine]]; this policy announcement was in fact retrospective as the Soviet Union had already failed to militarily intervene – despite urging from the GDR leader [[Erich Honecker]] – during the [[Soviet reaction to the Polish crisis of 1980–81|Polish crisis of 1980–81]].

Gorbachev's decision largely stemmed from the lack of economic development within the Eastern Bloc in comparison to the western industrial nations due to the persistence of increasingly incompatible production structures and the failure to create service-orientated, micro-electronic or globalized industries. The Soviet Union therefore increasingly lacked the materials to continue the arms race with the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]]-era United States – particularly with [[Soviet–Afghan War|a drawn-out war in Afghanistan]] – and the resources to control Central and Eastern Europe. With his economic and sociopolitical reform program as well as his disarmament initiatives, Gorbachev therefore sought to take appropriate steps.

Having initiated a policy of ''[[glasnost]]'' (openness) and emphasized the need for ''[[perestroika]]'' (economic restructuring), Gorbachev essentially permitted the [[Warsaw Pact|six member states of the Warsaw Pact]] to now each take their own direction with their own reforms. While those reforms implemented the Soviet Union were met with broad approval by the peoples across the other Eastern Bloc nations – in particular amongst students and academics – the respective governments of the region reacted at first with reserve and later, in part, with rejection of the reforms.

===SED hostility to Soviet reforms===
The fact that the GDR was a second German state, subject to western recognition and the wide influences from the West German side, meant it was considered to be of particular importance among the Eastern Bloc nations to the Soviet Union. As the weak outpost of the Iron Curtain, the GDR profited from both a unique economic relationship with the Soviet Union and a relatively stable supply situation. It was notably the only Warsaw Pact member to have large numbers of Soviet troops permanently stationed on its territory.

However, Gorbachev's reforms soured relations between the GDR leadership and the Soviet Union as the SED showed an increasingly clear dissociation from these policies. Information about the new developments in the Soviet Union was also placed under stronger censorship. In an interview with the weekly [[Stern (magazine)|''Stern'' magazine]] in March 1987, the SED's chief ideologist [[Kurt Hager]] commented disparagingly on perestroika: "If your neighbour wallpapered his apartment, would you also feel obliged to wallpaper your apartment?"

A further escalation of this hostility occurred in Autumn 1988 when the SED banned the Soviet monthly journal [[Sputnik (magazine)|Sputnik]], which had a circulation in the GDR of 190,000, on account of its supposedly distorted historical articles. This provoked a wave of protests from those in the GDR population, including even many SED members. At the turn of the year 1988/89 GDR leader Erich Honecker began speaking of "socialism in the colours of the GDR" to emphasize the countries' differences in policy.

==Catalysts for the crisis of 1989==

===Economic situation===
Since the start of the 1970s, Honecker had led social policies built on debt such as wage and pension increases, highly subsidized consumer prices, and large-scale home construction programs. When [[Günter Ehrensperger]], the leading economic expert in the SED Central Committee at the time, informed Honecker in November 1973 that the national debt would increase under the current economic direction from 2 to 20 billion [[w:de:westgeld|Valutamark]] by 1980, he was forbidden by Honecker from calculating such scenarios and ordered to destroy all evidence relating to such projections.

In 1981, a reduction in Soviet oil deliveries at special rates brought the GDR's planned economy into difficulties and throughout the decade insolvency was only avoided due to western credit. By the end of the 1980s GDR productivity in comparison to the FRG lay at only 30%. It was attempted at high cost to become a producer of micro electronics. Even the official presentation in September 1988 of a [[U61000|1-Megabit-Speicher]] that was firstly developed in the GDR, couldn't mask the slow speed of development in comparison with the West. Nonetheless, as late as August 1989, Honecker assured at a symbolic handing over of the first 32-Bit chip produced in the GDR that: "Neither an ox nor a donkey is able to stop the progress of socialism".

Reform of the economic system was rejected, with the chairman of 
[[Free German Trade Union Federation|the country's trade union federation]] [[Harry Tisch]] explaining to the Politbüro on 29 August 1989: "If the economic basis is formed in a capitalist manner, the socialist superstructure cannot be maintained".

Outdated production facilities and methods were not only economically inefficient but also caused environmental damage and affected people's health. There were barely any ecologically intact flowing waters and lakes; the means were lacking for more effective environmental protection. In some especially affected regions of Leipzig-Halle-Bitterfeld, loud speaker announcements were made to keep windows and doors closed. The legal but counterproductive measures of environmental protection created further hostility toward the regime.

===Electoral fraud===
As a consequence of the already heated political mood, the planned local elections of May 1989 took on greater significance than usual. GDR citizens had long become accustomed to casting their vote by simply folding their ballot paper containing the confirmed candidate list and placing it in the ballot box without even using the voting booths. However, after falsified electoral results at some polling stations in 1986 had been noted by oppositional observers, such controls were now supposed to be systematically carried out in all regions. Since the previous summer, different groups – mostly religious in nature – had called on Christians in the GDR to actively intervene in the preparation of the election on 7 May 1989.

In the face of rising unrest, the SED wanted as impressive an election result as possible and took precautionary action to achieve this. Hence, all those who had applied to travel abroad, known opponents of the regime and those who had failed to vote in past elections were all removed from the electoral roll. By the same token, by mid-April 1989, more than 80,000 people declared their non-participation in the election. Under the codename "Symbol 89", the Stasi undertook measures to hinder non-participation. Parallel to this, there was also the attempt to give this election a notably democratic feel. People were asked to raise their concerns with the [[National Front (East Germany)|National Front coalition]] and to involve themselves in the selection of the candidates. Attempts by independent groups to select different candidates, however, failed almost without exception.

On election day itself, 7 May 1989, there were some unusual aspects. In many places individuals only handed their voting cards in at the polling stations in order to demonstrate their refusal to vote; this added to large queues in front of the otherwise mostly unused voting booths. Electoral observers identified an estimate electoral turnout of around 60-80% in their voting spots and abstentions of between 3–30%. When [[Egon Krenz]] as Chairman of the Electoral Commission announced a 98.85% approval vote for the National Front candidates, this was viewed by many – not only by regime critics – as clear evidence of electoral fraud. There were districts in East Berlin where independent election observers at a selection of polling stations reported clearly counted more "no" votes than the official result for the entire area reported; a subsequent 1993 trial would find [[Hans Modrow]] and three other associates guilty of altering the results.

Over the following weeks, a multitude of criminal complaints, petitions and protest actions against the suspected fraud led to a large number of disputes and countless arrests. The public opposition to this was on a scale not before seen, bringing together those who had applied to leave the country and other opponents at events such as the Alexanderplatz demonstration in Berlin on 4 November 1989.

===Gap in the Iron Curtain===
The ability to freely travel from the GDR to non-socialist nations was only granted to select groups such as pensioners or performers considered to be basically loyal to the party as well as athletes going to take part in competition. Aside from such situations, travel was only permitted for urgent family situations, and only then generally granted to individuals whose family would meanwhile remain back in the GDR. Serious requests to permanently leave the GDR with one's family and belongings were, aside from highly restricted "humanitarian reasons", not tolerated and would result in the suffering of social marginalization and discrimination. Those who entered such applications, regardless of the harassment they knew they would face, normally had to reckon with a waiting list lasting years, or until West Germany simply "bought them out".

By 1989, there was effectively an understanding between the Warsaw Pact members that each would prevent citizens from exiting the Eastern bloc. Discovered attempts to flee, such as via Hungary into Austria, resulted in people being returned to the GDR, which would impose lengthy prison terms on a charge of an "attempted illegal border crossing". However, in the course of a reformist agenda as well as for economic reasons, Hungary began in May 1989 to firstly relax then eventually cease military control of its borders, thereby creating the first gap in the [[Iron Curtain]].

When summer holidays began in the GDR at the start of July 1989, more than 200,000 people made their way to Hungary, the majority simply as holiday-makers but thousands also with the intention to flee. A [[Pan-European Picnic]] on 19 August at [[Sopron]], Hungary, supposedly dedicated to the new perspectives for Europe, was used by 800-900 people as a chance to flee into Austria. By the start of August, word had spread that Hungary would not make any record of any person attempting to flee, removing the potential risk of future sanction from the GDR. Many therefore traveled to Hungary, often simply abandoning their cars there once they neared the border.

Once Hungary officially opened its borders to the waiting GDR citizens on 11 September 1989, some 15,000 people fled within the first three days, rising to almost 20,000 by the end of the month. In response, travel to Hungary was no longer permitted by the GDR authorities. Upon this decision, the West German embassies in Prague and Warsaw became overfilled with GDR citizens claiming their right to leave. When this congestion soon brought hygiene problems and the threat of disease, and with the refusal of the Czech government to have to deal with the problems of the GDR, Honecker felt compelled to allow the GDR refugees to travel as they wished. On 30 September the West German foreign minister [[Hans-Dietrich Genscher]] announced from the balcony of the embassy in Prague that those within the embassy grounds would be allowed to travel into the FRG via a train journey through the GDR; around 4,700 people left from the Prague embassy and a further 809 from Warsaw.

On 3 October, a further 6,000 people had forced themselves into the ground of the Prague embassy, with thousands more en route there too. The GDR leadership had to once more permit their exit by traveling on special trains through the GDR. Attempting to limit the exodus, the GDR closed its border with Czechoslovakia, which led to further outrage, particularly from those had been depending on that border. Those already close to the border, headed to Dresden where the trains containing those allowed to travel were expected to pass through. Here, protests and violent confrontations with police and special forces broke out, in which not only those wishing to leave the country but those regime opponents content to stay were also involved.

Chaplain Frank Richter attempted to deescalate the situation on 8 October by convincing demonstrators and police to instead negotiate. Twenty demonstrators were chosen to take part in talks with the Dresden Mayor Berghofer who had declared himself prepared to talk after church intervention. Events in Dresden showed the unity between the two great opposition forces, as "we want out" was countered with "we're staying here".

===Newly formed opposition===
Parallel to the rising tide of those fleeing the GDR during summer 1989 occurred the formation and expansion of opposition groups focused on reforming the GDR. As a result, a number of new and (for the SED) subversive political organizations were created, beginning with the founding of the [[New Forum]] on 9–10 September 1989. Among its most noted members at the time were [[Katja Havemann]], [[Rolf Henrich]] and [[Bärbel Bohley]].

Expressly constituted not as a party but as a "political platform", the New Forum focused on the collapsed lines of communication between the state and society. It demanded an open dialogue about "the functions of the constitutional state, the economy and culture". They hoped for better goods and supply, but were also concerned by the costs and economic consequences. It called for economic initiatives but wanted to counter an "elbow society".

The calls of the New Forum prompted other opposition groups to now step into the spotlight with their own specific demands and political visions. "[[Democracy Now]]" emerged with its hope of a democratically reformed socialism with a Christian and critical accent - similarly against the western consumer society. On 1 October a further political group in the shape of "[[Democratic Awakening]]" with the regime critics [[Rainer Eppelmann]] and [[Friedrich Schorlemmer]] also entered the fray.

Many of these new groups consciously formed themselves not as political parties but instead used terms like forum, league or movement, which placed themselves within the concept of a civil movement. They placed value on basic democracy, openness and transparency in decision-making, in which interested non-members should also be able to participate.

The reformation of the [[Social Democratic Party in the GDR|Social Democratic Party]] on 7 October 1989, the 40th anniversary of the GDR's founding, which soon came under the leadership of the evangelical theologians [[Martin Gutzeit]] and [[Markus Meckel]], was also of note.

==Decisive events of October–November 1989==
The forming of oppositional groups across the GDR against the SED regime and the growing willingness of the populace to demonstrate became an additional threat to those in power, who were already overburdened with the problem of those fleeing the country.

Attempting to scare off protesters, the SED used the events that had unfolded around the time of the GDR elections in PR China where an oppositional student movement had demonstrated on 17 April 1989 in Beijing. On the occasion of a state visit from Gorbachev, which drew media attention from across the world, a million people came together to protest on 15–18 May. A day after Gorbachev departed, though, martial law was declared and during the night of 3/4 June 1989 the Chinese military was put into action against the opposition, leading to the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiannamen Square massacre]]. The violent suppression of the opposition left thousands dead and tens of thousands injured across China.

The Chinese response to the protesters was viewed positively by the SED regime. The edition of the official party newspaper ''[[Neues Deutschland]]'' on 5 June 1989 carried the headline: "China's liberation army defeats counter-revolutionary rioting". A statement read in the Peoples Chamber announced that law and order [in China] had been restored following disorder created by elements acting against the constitution.

In the weeks from the start of October until the opening of the border in November, it was completely unclear to both those affected and those watching on, whether the GDR leadership would seek to save itself using the "Chinese solution". As a precaution, the national army of the GDR was placed on high combat readiness during 6–9 October.

===GDR's 40th anniversary===
The SED wanted the jubilee celebrations on 7 October 1989 to pass as smoothly as possible. They therefore allowed the speedy deportation of the embassy refugees and also permitted their family members to follow.

However, problems had already arisen during the run-up to the day: Rejected invites from guests, those selected to receive honors stayed away and all sorts of abandoned events. On the day of the anniversary, western journalists were denied entry to the country. Here and there, anti-celebratory events took place. At peace prayers, the 40th anniversary celebrations were partly critically mentioned; in Gotha, for example, forty candles were extinguished as a symbol of extinguished hope. Gorbachev, who had traveled for the celebrations, saw the writing on the wall for the SED regime.

Aside from the official celebrations, there were also many demonstrations of protest across the GDR: From protesters who congregated on the 7th of each month at the [[Alexanderplatz]] in Berlin to remember the electoral fraud, a protest march was formed that headed toward the [[Palace of the Republic (Berlin)|Palace of the Republic]], where the main celebratory banquet was taking place. The growing crowd of around 3,000 made its presence known with chants of "Gorbi, Gorbi", "no violence" and "democracy - now or never". However, under pressure from the security forces guarding the venue, the crowd could not directly reach it and instead swerved away to [[Prenzlauer Berg]], where over 2,000 people were at the time gathered in the [[Gethsemane Church]].

In total, 1,200 arrests were made, including people completely uninvolved. The majority were released from custody within 24 hours but reported being beaten, kicked, spat at or denied usage of a toilet. Unlike the other protests across the GDR, the events in East Berlin were directly reported in western media. While GDR citizens were officially prohibited from receiving western media, only a small portion of the population willingly abstained for ideological reasons. Some regions in the north-east and south-east were however closed off from West German television because they lay outside the transmitter range (satirically known as the so-called [[Tal der Ahnungslosen|Valley of the Clueless]]).

===Large-scale demonstrations===
{{see also|Monday demonstrations in East Germany|Alexanderplatz demonstration}}
Of all the events seeking a peaceful and successful conclusion to the uprising against the SED dictatorship, the mass demonstrations in Leipzig under the watch of international publicity would become most pivotal. Here, over 10,000 people had already forced their way past police lines on 2 October 1989 and marched to the [[St. Thomas Church, Leipzig|St Thomas Church]] after peace prayers in the [[St. Nicholas Church, Leipzig|St Nicholas Church]] and the Reformed Church. They countered Honecker's verbal attacks on them in the media with the chant: "We're no hooligans". This was spontaneously turned from a denial to a positive statement, which became the slogan of this revolution: "We are the people!".

At the following Monday demonstration in Leipzig on 9 October – two days after the 40th anniversary celebrations – the SED leadership initially hoped to restore its authority against the protesters. In addition to 8,000 armed security personnel, a further 5,000 people connected to the SED were supposed to mix themselves in plain clothes in among the demonstrators and cause disruption.

That the planned suppression of the [[Monday demonstrations in East Germany|Monday demonstration]] on 9 October was not seriously attempted did not lie solely with the fact that the planned police tactics were unlikely to have succeeded due to the scale of the crowd. The atmosphere of this demonstration was also influenced by an appeal for no violence by the three prominent Leipzig figures had agreed with three SED local party functionaries, and which had been broadcast over local radio during the day. In this, dialogue and contemplation was promoted.

Opinion among the SED chiefs was split upon how to react. [[Egon Krenz]] declared in advance of the event in Leipzig that it could not come to violent means, even if the security forces themselves became attacked. When Krenz was telephoned by chief officer Helmut Hackenberg in Leipzig at 18:30 to confirm that there should be no action taken, he assured Hackenberg that he would call him back swiftly. However, while he did indeed confirm that, 45 minutes had by then passed, during which time most demonstrators had departed.

The peaceful passing-off of this demonstration encouraged many that reforms could be peacefully reached in the GDR and hereafter people became ever more willing to go on to the street. On 4 November the largest protest demonstration in GDR history took place at the Berlin Alexanderplatz. An estimated 500,000 attended the event, where civil rights campaigners, poets, actors and some political figures broke from the SED regime and declared their reform demands.

===SED loss of power===
Leading up the 40th anniversary celebrations, the SED leadership had used all available means to curtail the wave of people leaving the country and the pressure (both domestically and internationally) to reform. When the celebrations of 7 October 1989 failed to create the desired effect, the disillusionment became resounding. Ever since Honecker's health began to decline due to a bilious complaint that first struck at the Bucharest summit of the Warsaw Pact leaders in early July 1989 - at which the parting from the [[Brezhnev Doctrine]] and the principle to not become involved in the domestic situations of the individual states was officially laid down - an overriding sense of helplessness had set into the SED Politburo in the face of the growing opposition to their leadership of the country and the dictatorial status of the party.

As Honecker rejected each of Krenz's proposed changes of course following the flawed anniversary celebrations, Krenz secured himself the support of other Politburo members in order to overthrow Honecker and become his successor on 18 October 1989. His first keynote speech before the SED's Central Committee was broadcast on East German television, in which he abstained from the popular terms "glasnost" and "perestroika" and instead set a future course of reforms on his own terms: "I must find a German term that both allows a turning to the proven ways of the GDR for 40 years but that also makes clear that we turn away from all that has brought our country to the current situation. With today's congress we will begin a turning point. Above all, we will regain the political and ideological offensive".

Krenz himself admitted in hindsight that this speech took the wrong note: "The people don't want to hear any more long speeches that sound like party reports. They want to know: Who is responsible for the country standing in the abyss? What are the causes? How should it go forward?". The change of power from Honecker to Krenz failed to quell the discontent within the country and Krenz's offer of a dialogue that should win the SED back "the political and ideological offensive" fizzled out in the hands of the party representatives within a few weeks.

After Krenz had called for an "unvarnished picture of the economic situation", the report of a commission led by [[Gerhard Schürer]] offered little comfort. For a country to be credit worthy, its [[debt service ratio]] should not grow beyond 25%. In 1989, the GDR's debt-service ratio according to Schürer's figures was 150%. The commission was unable to suggest any way out of the situation and reported that an end to debt would mean an expected 25-30% decline in living standards in 1990 and make the country ungovernable.

The finger pointing was not limited to those closest to Honecker but also directed at the entire leadership. On 1 December 1989, the People's Chamber struck the SED's right to govern from the [[Constitution of East Germany|GDR constitution]]. The Politburo and SED Central Committee resigned ''en masse'' under mounting internal and external pressure on 3 December 1989, and three days later, Krenz also resigned as chairman of the privy council.

===Fall of the Berlin Wall and border opening===
{{see also|Fall of the inner German border}}
That there couldn't remain the makeshift exit from the GDR across Czechoslovakia and that a travel law was now needed, which also had to offer reasonable conditions to those willing to return again, was by this point now clear to most of those in power in the SED.

A draft travel law published in ''[[Neues Deutschland]]'' on 6 November was negatively received by the people and in the People's Chamber. A new bill by the head of the passport department Gerhard Lauter was put before the Central Committee by Krenz and quickly debated and rubber-stamped. With the paper handed over by Krenz – and bearing some additional changes from the Central Committee session – [[Günter Schabowski]] attended a press conference with the international media that was also broadcast live on East German television. Responding to a question by the Italian [[Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata|ANSA]] correspondent Riccardo Ehrman, Schabowski answered that the possibility to travel across the border into West German territory "without the existence of preconditions" existed "immediately, without delay". The new conditions were however only meant to come into effect from 4 am on the following day but this information had only been verbally shared at the Politburo sitting, at which Schabowski had not been present.

The reaction to the statement was instantaneous as news spread across western media that the GDR had abandoned its border controls. The West German parliament in Bonn interrupted its evening session to sing the national anthem. In East Berlin, more and more people made their way to the inner-city border checkpoints. No information had been conveyed to staff at the checkpoints though and it was only under pressure from the large crowd numbers that the first East Berliners were permitted to pass into West Berlin. Lieutenant-Colonel [[Harald Jäger]] ordered all passports to be stamped as henceforth invalid, thereby expatriating those leaving the GDR without their knowledge. The first crossings occurred at [[Bornholmer Straße border crossing|Bornholmer Strasse]] at 9.20pm. By 11:30 pm, attempts to stamp all passports were abandoned and the control barrier raised with the remaining checkpoints in Berlin then also being opened.

During the following hours, Berliners from both sides of the city celebrated at the wall as well as on both sides of the border after 28 years of separation. Checkpoints along the [[inner German border]] were also passable on this night. The following weekend also brought a huge wave of travelers as the East German authorities issued more than four million visas for travel into the west.

==Political situation during the transition==
The fall of the Berlin Wall and opening of the inner German border set new challenges for both the government and opposition in the GDR as well as those in power in the FRG. These events also brought wider world into play, with Germany's European neighbors and the [[Four-Power Authorities|four victors of World War II]] having their own input. General opinion saw the fate of the GDR resting upon the attitude of the Soviet Union under Gorbachev. In his memoirs, West German chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]] wrote that he had confronted the Soviet head during his visit to the FRG in June 1989 with the view that German unity would arrive - even against opposition - as surely as the Rhein that the two looked upon would arrive at the sea; Gorbachev did not dispute this.

After 9 November there was not only a growing wave of demonstrations across the GDR, but also a strong shift in the prevailing attitude to solutions. Instead of the chant "we are the people", the new and ever-more-heard refrain was "we are one people!". An unsolved problem for both the East and the West remained the continually high numbers moving from the GDR to the FRG, which created an ever-destabilizing effect in the GDR while also placing an ever-larger burden on the FRG to handle and integrate such large numbers.

===Kohl's reunification plan===
On the day the Berlin Wall fell, West German chancellor Kohl and his foreign minister [[Hans-Dietrich Genscher]] were on a state visit to Poland that was cut short to allow Kohl to directly react to the new situation. Only a day earlier, Kohl had set out new conditions for closer collaboration with the GDR leadership within a document entitled "Report on the state of the nation in divided Germany": The SED's abandonment of its monopoly on power, the allowing of independent parties, free elections and the building up of a market economy. During a telephone conversation on 11 November with SED General Secretary [[Egon Krenz]] – who stressed the positivity of the border opening and "radical reforms", but insisted that reunification was not on the agenda – Kohl conceded that the creation of "reasonable relations" was currently most pressing.

At first Kohl refrained from pushing through his wish for reunification to avoid raising the expected annoyance abroad about the topic. His closest foreign adviser at the time, [[Horst Teltschik]], took confidence though from opinion polls on 20 November, which showed 70% of West Germans to be favor of reunification and that 48% considered it possible within ten years. More than 75% approved financial aid for the GDR, though without tax increases to fund it. From a conversation with [[Nikolai Portugalow]], a high-ranking emissar of Gorbachev's, Teilschik learned that [[Hans Modrow]]'s suggestion of a treaty between the two German states had already prompted the Soviets to plan for "the unthinkable".

With Kohl's blessing, Teltschik developed a path toward German unification. To his ten-point plan, entitled the "Ten Point Program for Overcoming the Division of Germany and Europe", Kohl added some additions and surprised all by reading it out in parliament on 28 November. Starting with immediate measures, the path shall flow through a contractual arrangement and the development of confederative structures to conclude with one federation.

The plan was broadly accepted in parliament even by the opposition with the exception of the Green Party that endorsed the independence of the GDR, like many GDR civil liberties campaigners, in "a third way". The SPD was partly skeptical and divided. While the former chancellor [[Willy Brandt]] coined the expression on 10 November: "What now grows together, belongs together". [[Oscar Lafontaine]], soon to be nominated as the SPD's chancellor candidate, picked out the central themes of the GDR as being the incalculable financial risks and the curtailing of the number of those leaving.

===International reactions to developments===
The sudden announcement of Kohl's ten-point plan caused substantial irritation among European heads of states and Soviet chief Gorbachev. British Premier [[Margaret Thatcher]] saw international stability becoming endangered and raised doubts about the peacefulness of a united and restrengthened Germany. French President [[François Mitterrand]] was concerned that the German government could give up its tight commitment to the [[European integration]] process and instead focus on its national interests and ambitions for power. In early December 1989, he sought with Gorbachev to ensure "that the whole European process develops faster than the German question and that it overtakes the German development. We must form pan-European structures". Gorbachev informed West German foreign minister Genscher that Kohl was behaving "like a bull in a china shop".

In light of these frosty reaction, the West German government viewed a meeting of the four Allied Powers in the Berlin Building of the Allied Government on 11 December 1989 as a demonstrative affront. Only the US government, under [[George H. W. Bush]] at this time, offered the West German chancellor support by already setting out the day after Kohl's 10-point plan its own interests in any potential German reunification.

Kohl stressed that the driving factor behind the developments was the GDR populace and not the FRG government, which was itself surprised by the dynamics of events and had to react. He aimed to preempt a state visit by Mitterrand to the GDR on 20–22 December 1989 and planned talks with Minister President Modrow. Visiting Dresden on 19 December, Kohl spoke before a crowd of 100,000, who broke out into cheers when he stated: "My goal remains - if the historical hour allows - the uniting of our nation".

When Mitterrand realized that, with the rapid change of circumstances in the GDR, controlling development from outside was not possible, he sought to commit the West German government to a foreseeable united Germany on two matters: On the final recognition of Poland's western border and on quickened European integration through the establishment of a currency union. In January 1990, the Soviet Union sent understanding signals by appealing to West Germany for food deliveries due to supply shortages. On 10 February 1990, Kohl and his advisers had positive talks with Gorbachev in Moscow, which freed up the path to reunification.

===Situation in the GDR===
After his election as Minister President in the People's Chamber on 13 November 1989, Hans Modrow affirmed in his government statement of 16 November that – from the GDR viewpoint – reunification was not on the agenda.

Since the end of October opposition groups had called for the creations of a round table. They released a communal statement: "In light of the critical situation in our country, which can no longer be controlled by the previous power and responsibility structures, we demand that representatives of the GDR population come together to negotiate at a round table, in order to established conditions for constitutional reform and for free elections.

Aimed at her fellow citizens, the East German author [[Christa Wolf]] – who, on the night before the opening of the border had called for people to remain in the GDR – read out an appeal on television on 28 November entitled "For Our Country", whose first 31 signatures of support came from GDR artists and civil liberties campaigners as well as critical SED members. During a press conference on the same day, the author [[Stefan Heym]] also read out the appeal and within a few days, it had received 1.17 million signatures. It called for "a separate identity for the GDR" to be established and warned against a "sell-out of our material and moral values" through reunification, stating there was still "the chance to develop a socialist alternative to the FRG as an equal partner amongst the states of Europe".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=For Our Land|url=http://www.maxhertzberg.co.uk/background/politics/for-our-country/#forourland|accessdate=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the first meeting of the Central Round Table on 7 December the participants defined the function of the new body as an advisory and decision-making institution. Unlike the Polish example for this body, where the Solidarity delegates confronted the government, the Central Round Table in the GDR was formed from representatives of numerous new oppositional groups on one side and delegates made up in equal number from the SED, bloc parties and the SED-linked mass organizations on the other. To the approval of both sides, church representatives acted as moderators.

The socialist reform program of Modrow's government lacked support both domestically and internationally. On a visit to Moscow at the end of January 1990, Modrow admitted to Gorbachev: "The growing majority of the GDR population no longer supports the idea of the existence of two German states; it no longer seems possible to sustain this idea.[…] If we don't grasp the initiative now, then the process already set in motion will spontaneously and eruptively continue onward without us being able to have any influence upon it".

In order to expand the basis of trust for his own government at least for the transitional phase until free elections, Modrow offered the opposition groups at the Central Round Table on 22 January the chance to participate in government. The majority of these groups agreed a counter offer of placing candidates from the Central Round Table in a non-party transitional government. Modrow considered this an attempt to dismantle his government and rejected these suggestions on 28 January. After lengthy negotiations and Modrow's threatening to resign, the opposition relented and accepted a place in the government as "ministers without portfolio". However, when Modrow committed to a one-nation Germany a few days later, the United Left withdrew its acceptance due to "a breach of trust" and rejected being involving in the government.

After the entry into the cabinet on 5 February 1990, all nine new "ministers" traveled with Hans Modrow to Bonn for talks with the West German government on 13 February. As had already occurred during Kohl's visit to Dresden two months earlier, Modrow was denied the immediate financial support to avoid the threat of insolvency (although a prospective currency union had already been on offer for several days). The talks were largely unproductive, with Kohl unwilling to make any decisive appointments with the pivotal election only weeks away.

==Commemoration==
The peaceful revolution is regularly commemorated and celebrated in Germany and other countries. On 18 September 2014, [[President of Germany|German president]] [[Joachim Gauck]] welcomed the heads of states of (partly) [[German-speaking Europe|German-speaking countries]] [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]], [[Belgium]], [[Luxembourg]] and [[Liechtenstein]] to [[Mecklenburg]]. They met in [[Bad Doberan]], [[Warnemünde]] and the city of [[Rostock]] to commemorate the peaceful revolution of 1989 and to address the challenges of [[Ageing of Europe|demographic change in Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joachim Gauck welcomes presidents to Mecklenburg to address demographic change and commemorate the Wende|url=http://www.bundespraesident.de/SharedDocs/Pressemitteilungen/DE/2014/09/140908-fuenf-Staatsoberhaeupter.html|website=Official Presidential Website|accessdate=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Paris1919bookcover.jpg|thumb|200px]]
'''''Peacemakers: The Paris Peace Conference of 1919 and Its Attempt to End War''''' (2001) is a historical narrative about the events of the [[Paris Peace Conference of 1919]]. It was written by the Canadian historian [[Margaret MacMillan]] with a foreword by American diplomat [[Richard Holbrooke]].  The book has also been published under the titles '''''Paris 1919: Six Months That Changed the World''''' and '''''Peacemakers: Six Months That Changed the World'''''.

''Peacemakers'' describes the six months of negotiations that took place in [[Paris, France]] following [[World War I]].  The book focuses on the "Big Three", photographed together on its cover (left to right): Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] of the United Kingdom, Premier [[Georges Clemenceau]] of France, and President [[Woodrow Wilson]] of the United States.

The book argues that the conditions imposed on Germany in the [[Treaty of Versailles]] did not lead to the rise of [[Adolf Hitler]], asking the question: Was the Great War "an unmitigated catastrophe in a sea of mud", or "about something", and concluding "It is condescending and wrong to think they were hoodwinked."

British World War I Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] is the author's great-grandfather.

==Reception==
The book was first published in Britain. It has won the £5,000 [[Duff Cooper Prize]] for an outstanding literary work in the field of history, biography or politics, the £3,000 [[Hessell-Tiltman Prize]] for History, the prestigious BBC [[Samuel Johnson Prize]] for the best work of non-fiction published in the United Kingdom and the [[2003 Governor General's Awards|2003 Governor General's Literary Award]] in Canada.

The book has been adapted as a 2009 [[docudrama]] film entitled "Paris 1919," by [[Paul Cowan (filmmaker)|Paul Cowan]], produced by the [[National Film Board of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20090105.wparis0106/BNStory/Entertainment/home|title=Paris 1919: Years in the making, 10 days to film|last=Dixon|first=Guy|date=2009-01-05|work=Globe and Mail|accessdate=2009-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacMillan recorded a related series of fourteen lectures for the [[audiobook]] ''Six Months That Changed the World: The Paris Peace Conference of 1919'' ([[Recorded Books]], [[The Modern Scholar]] series, 2003).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11537">'''Refugees of the Libyan Civil War''' are the people, predominantly [[Libya]]ns, who fled or were expelled from their homes during the [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Libyan Civil War]], from within the borders of Libya to the neighbouring states of Tunisia, Egypt and Chad, as well as to European countries across the Mediterranean. The majority of Libyan refugees are Arabs and Berbers, though many of the other ethnicities temporarily living in Libya originated from sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref name=telegraph23feb&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/8343963/Libya-Italy-fears-300000-refugees.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Nick | last=Squires | title=Libya: Italy fears 300,000 refugees | date=23 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These groups were also among the first refugee waves to exit the country. The total number of Libyan refugees were estimated at around one million as of June 2011 and most returned after the civil war ended. As of January 2013, there were 5,252 refugees originating from Libya alongside 59,425 [[Internally displaced person|internally displaced persons]] registered by the UNHCR.&lt;ref name="UNHCR2013"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unhcr.org/pages/49e485f36.html |title=2013 UNHCR country operations profile - Libya |publisher=[[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UNCHR]] |date=2013 |accessdate=12 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This represented between 10 and 15% of the population of Libya prior to the NATO intervention.

According to journalist Barbara Slavin, reporting for Al Monitor on August 5, 2014, Tunisian President Moncef Marzouki stated that two million Libyans, or one third of the pre NATO intervention population of Libya, have taken refuge in Tunisia.&lt;ref name=almonitor05Aug2014Tunisia&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/08/tunisia-africa-summit-terrorists-helicopters.html | location=Washington D.C. | work=Al Monitor | first=Barbara | last=Slavin | title= Tunisia's president asks US for help | date=5 August  2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Exodus===
Fleeing the violence of Tripoli by road, as many as 4,000 refugees were crossing the Libya&amp;ndash;Tunisia border daily during the first days of the 2011 civil war. Among those escaping the violence were native Libyans as well as foreign nationals including [[Egypt]]ians, [[Tunisia]]ns and [[Turkey|Turks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/africa-mideast/live-update-thousands-flee-across-libya-tunisia-border/article1918670/ |title=Live Update: Thousands Flee Across Libya–Tunisia Border |work= [[The Globe and Mail]] |date=24 February 2011 |accessdate=18 March 2011 |location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1 March 2011, officials from the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UN High Commissioner for Refugees]] had confirmed allegations of discrimination against sub-Saharan Africans who were held in dangerous conditions in the no-man's-land between Tunisia and Libya.&lt;ref name=tgam&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/africa-mideast/at-a-tense-border-crossing-a-systematic-effort-to-keep-black-africans-out/article1925955/|title = At a Tense Border Crossing, a Systematic Effort To Keep Black Africans Out|author=Saunders, Doug |date=1 March 2011 |work= [[The Globe and Mail]] |accessdate=3 March 2011 |location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 May 2011, The Week posted an article claiming that roughly 746,000 people have fled Libya since the war began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://theweek.com/article/index/215116/libyas-devastating-refugee-crisis-by-the-numbers|title=Libya's 'devastating' refugee crisis: By the numbers|work=The Week|location=Libya|date=10 May 2011|accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A provisional refugee camp was set up at [[Ras Ajdir]] on the Libyan-Tunisian border and had a capacity for 10,000, but was overflowing with an estimated 20,000 to 30,000 refugees. By 3 March 2011, the situation there was described as a logistical nightmare, with the [[World Health Organization]] warning of the risk of epidemics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sayar|first1=Scott|last2=Cowell|first2=Alan|date=3 March 2011|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/04/world/africa/04refugee.html|title=Libyan Refugee Crisis Called a 'Logistical Nightmare|work=The New York Times|accessdate=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; To continue responding to the needs of people staying at the Ras Ajdir crossing point in Tunisia, the WFP and [[Secours Islamique-France]] upgraded a kitchen that would provide breakfast for families. Separately, the ICRC advised it was handing over its operations at the Choucha Camp to the [[Tunisian Red Crescent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/update/2011/libya-update-2011-04-15.htm |title=Libya: More Aid To Reach Misrata and Other Areas |publisher= [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 24 March 2011, the WFP supplied over 42,500 cooked meals for TCNs at the Sallum border. A total of 1,650 cartons of fortified date bars (equivalent of 13.2 metric tons) had also been provided to supplement these meals.&lt;ref name="reliefweb1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Full_Report_152.pdf|title=OCHA on Libya's Refugees Covering the Period of 10 to 12 April|format=PDF|publisher=Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs|work=ReliefWeb|accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over 500 mostly [[Berber people|Berber]] Libyans fled their homes in Libya's [[Nafusa Mountains]] and took shelter in the [[Dehiba]] area of southeastern Tunisia between 5 and 12 April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.unhcr.org/4da42b1f9.html |title=Hundreds of Libyan Berbers Flee Western Mountains and Head to Tunisia |publisher=[[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UNCHR]]|date=12 April 2011 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'' reported on 11 September that almost the entire population of [[Tawergha]], a town of about 10,000 people, had been forced to flee their homes by anti-Gaddafi fighters after their [[Battle of Tawergha|takeover of the settlement]]. The report suggested that Tawergha, which was dominated by black Libyans, may have been the subject of an [[ethnic cleansing]] provoked by a combination of [[racism]] and bitterness on the part of [[Misrata]]n fighters over the Tawergha's support for Gaddafi during the [[Battle of Misrata|siege of Misrata]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/8754375/Gaddafis-ghost-town-after-the-loyalists-retreat.html|work=The Telegraph|first=Andrew|last=Gilligan|date=11 September 2011|accessdate=12 September 2011|title=Gaddafi's ghost town after the loyalists retreat|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 October 2011, Red Cross official Abdelhamid al-Mendi said that more than 50,000 Libyans had fled their homes in Benghazi since the war began in February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/10/01/169544.html|title=Snipers halt NTC’s advance in Sirte; rebels deny capture of Qaddafi’s spokesman|work=Al Arabiya News|location=Sirte|date=1 October 2011|accessdate=1 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After 2011 war===
As of January 2013, there were 5,252 refugees originating from Libya alongside 59,425 [[Internally displaced person|internally displaced persons]].&lt;ref name="UNHCR2013"/&gt; However the Le Monde article of May 14, 2014  stated that "Estimates of their numbers vary between 600,000 and one million by the Tunisian Ministry of Interior. If we add those, many also settled in Egypt, they would be nearly two million Libyans today outside the borders of a total population estimated at just over six million inhabitants."&lt;ref name="lemonde13may14"/&gt;

According to journalist Barbara Slavin, reporting for Al Monitor on August 5, 2014, Tunisian President Moncef Marzouki stated that two million Libyans, or one third of the pre NATO intervention population of Libya, have taken refuge in Tunisia.&lt;ref name=almonitor05Aug2014Tunisia&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/08/tunisia-africa-summit-terrorists-helicopters.html | location=Washington D.C. | work=Al Monitor | first=Barbara | last=Slavin | title= Tunisia's president asks US for help | date=5 August  2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Benghazi]] is the area that hosts the largest share of identified IDPs, with 115,000 IDPs residing there, which as a group account for (27.6%) of all IDPs in Libya. It is followed by [[Ajdabiya]] with 31,750 of IDPs (7.6%), [[Bayda, Libya|Bayda]] with 21,500 IDPs (5.2%), Abu Salim with 21,475 IDPs (5.1%), Bani Waled with 20,000 IDPs (4.8%), Alzintan with 19,425 IDPs (4.7%), Tobruk with 16,375 (3.9%), Al Ajaylat with 13,500 IDPs (3.2%), Janzour with 10,105 IDP (2.4%), Sabha with 7,215 (1.7%), and Tarhuna with 7,150 IDPs (1.7%). Combined, these 10 locations account for 67.9% of the total identified IDP population. The 31 areas shown in the table below jointly host 87.1 % of the total identified IDP population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Libya%20Displacement%20Tracking%20Matrix%20(DTM)%20Round%20Three%20Report%20-%20IOM.pdf DISPLACEMENT TRACKING MATRIX DTM ROUND 3 MARCH—APRIL 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rock Against Bush''' was a project mobilizing [[punk rock|punk]] and alternative musicians against the [[U.S. presidential election, 2004|2004 U.S. Presidential]] [[George W. Bush presidential campaign, 2004|re-election campaign]] of [[George W. Bush]]. At its core was the idea of using music to create a vibe of [[anti-war]] and [[pacifism|pro-peace]] sentiment, similar to counterculture music movements of the 1960s and 1970s, such as [[Woodstock]].

The effort was initiated by [[Fat Mike]] (Michael Burkett) of the band [[NOFX]], inspired by the Rock Against Reagan campaign of the early 1980s. It included [[live concert]]s, a series of compilation albums, and is associated with the Punkvoter website. Its goal was to encourage people, especially punk fans, to register to vote and to oppose Bush. The album proceeds were used to support a 2004 concert tour and an associated [[voter registration drive]], emphasizing the [[swing state]]s. The effort did not achieve its goal, as [[George W. Bush]] went on to win the election. The albums have been issued by the [[Fat Wreck Chords]] label, which focuses on skate and pop punk artists, so most of the songs are by similar themed bands. Both a CD and a DVD were included, the latter containing documentaries critical of Bush, music videos, and comedy.

The effort inspired Australian punk bands to start [[Rock Against Howard]].

==Criticisms==
Rock Against Bush and Punkvoter were subject to criticism on multiple fronts. A similar (but more obscure) project was started by conservative punks called "Crush Kerry". In addition, more radical punks (especially anarchists) criticized the emphasis on [[electoral politics]], as well as the tacit endorsement of [[John Kerry]], who they believed was not much better than George W. Bush. The band [[Propagandhi]] decided not to participate when [[Fat Mike]] requested that they change the lyrics of a song critical of [[George Soros]] that they wished to contribute.&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} [http://www.punknews.org/article/8664/fat-mike--propagandhi-clarify-situation-updated Fat Mike / Propagandhi clarify situation &amp;#91;UPDATED&amp;#93;]&lt;/ref&gt;

T-shirts were also printed, depicting Fat Mike with the text "Not My Political Advisor", as a parody of the "Not My President" shirts that depicted Bush, issued by Fat Mike. Fat Mike himself stated he found this to be "pretty funny".

The '''SS ''Puerto Rican''''', was an American-flagged [[Tanker (ship)|tanker]] disabled by an explosion in 1984. 

==The incident==
The ship was eight miles off the [[Golden Gate]]  on October 31, 1984, at 3:24 a.m., when she was torn by a very large double explosion just forward of her deck house. A 100-foot section of deck, the whole width of the vessel, was thrown up and then back down forward on the deck in front of it, as flames shot hundreds of feet in the air.
[[File:Pointheyer.jpg|thumb|Coast Guard cutter Pt. Heyer stands by as the stricken tanker SS Puerto Rican burns following a massive explosion, October 31, 1984.]]
==Loss of life, Coast Guard response, partial sinking==
A bar pilot, the third mate, and a crew member were thrown into the sea.  The pilot boat ''San Francisco'' rescued the badly injured pilot and mate, but the crewman was lost.  As fire raged onboard, the [[Coast Guard]] towed the crippled ship further out to sea, to keep her from breaking up and dumping her cargo near San Francisco Bay. On November 1, a storm passed through the area, battering the ''Puerto Rican'' with 35 MPH winds and 16 foot seas. That evening, after 32 hours of effort, navy fireboats finally extinguished the fire.  On November 3, 30 miles southwest of the Golden Gate, she broke up, her stern section sinking to a depth of 1500 feet within the boundaries of the Gulf of the [[Farallons National Marine Sanctuary]]. Over a million and a quarter gallons of refined petroleum products, about one-third of ''Puerto Rican's'' cargo, went into the water. 

==Suspicion of bombing and subsequent investigation==
In the days after the explosion, there were intimations in the media of sabotage linked to a labor dispute.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, Nov. 1, 1984, page 1. https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/01/us/fbi-investigating-possibility-of-bombing-in-tanker-explosion.html&lt;/ref&gt; The vessel had been picketed in a Bay Area port and some of its crew harassed by maritime union pickets.&lt;ref&gt;U.S Coast Guard, Marine Casualty Report, Tankship Puerto Rican, 15 June 1985, pages 25–27. http://www.dco.uscg.mil/Portals/9/DCO%20Documents/5p/CG-5PC/INV/docs/boards/puertorican.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. The FBI intervened, but it was quickly determined that no point source explosion had occurred. Later it was found that the explosion probably resulted from holes in tank compartment bulkheads that allowed caustic soda to mix with zinc, forming deadly hydrogen gas that then exploded.  A Coast Guard board of investigation attributed this to the negligence of the ship's officers on the inbound voyage from Long Beach.  But no cause of the explosion could be established with certainty.&lt;ref&gt;Same source, page 75-76.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oil spill impact==
The environmental impact was significant. In addition to the initial spill, the sunken stern section continued to discharge heavy bunker oil – as much as 8,000 barrels – for months and possibly years afterwards.  An estimated 4,815 seabirds were killed by oiling as a result of this spill; another 1,368 were recovered.&lt;ref&gt;Harry R. Carter, Oil and California's Seabirds: An Overview. Marine Ornithology 31: 1–7 (2003). Table 1, p. 7. http://www.marineornithology.org/PDF/31_1/31_1_1_carter.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Donner Party''''' is a 2009 [[period piece|period]] [[drama film]] written and directed by Terrence Martin (credited as T.J. Martin), and starring [[Crispin Glover]], [[Clayne Crawford]], [[Michele Santopietro]], [[Mark Boone Junior]], and [[Christian Kane]]. It is based on the true story of the [[Donner Party]], an 1840s westward traveling group of settlers headed for California. Becoming snowbound in the Sierra Nevada mountains, with food increasingly scarce, a small group calling themselves "The Forlorn Hope" turned to cannibalism. ''The Forlorn'' was the working title for the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Voeller, Carey R. |title='A man is a fool who prefers poor California beef to human flesh': (Re)Definitions of Masculinity in Nineteenth-Century US Donner Party Literature|journal=Western American Literature|volume= 44|number=3 |year=2009|page= 219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the original production company pulled funding for the project, so several changes were made. The title change was a marketing choice by the distributor.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Kristin.

===Home media===
The film was released on [[DVD]] by [[First Look Pictures]] on January 26, 2010. It was later re-released by [[Millennium Entertainment]] on October 20, 2015 as a part of its 12 Movie Sci-Fi Pack.&lt;ref name="dvdrelease"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Donner Party (2009) - T.J.

==Reception==
{{expand section|date=November 2017}}
[[Dread Central]] awarded the film a score of three out of five, commending Glover and Boone Junior's performances, writing: "T.J. Martin's cinematic version of this dreadful episode in American history is carried off rather well although, as always seems to be the case with films based on historical events, a lot of what transpires in the film never happened, which IS annoying to history buffs like myself. At least the film was shot during the winter in the Donner Pass near Truckee, California, which helped with the verisimilitude."&lt;ref name="dreadcentral"&gt;{{cite web|title=Donner Party, The (2009) - Dread Central|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/15622/donner-party-the-2009/|website=Dread Central.com|publisher=thebellefromhell|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
''Horror News.Net'' gave the film a positive review, writing, "Overall "The Donner Party" was a nice change from the hard core horror films that I usually watch. I have a feeling it will be shown in a lot of high school history classes in the future as there is really nothing offensive that would make it inappropriate for younger viewers. If you are in the mood for something a little different I suggest you give it a try. I also recommend that you have something to eat on hand while watching it as I was starving by the time I was done watching it. Then again, maybe I have issues."&lt;ref name="horrornews"&gt;{{cite web|title=Film Review: The Donner Party (2009)|url=http://horrornews.net/27390/film-review-the-donner-party-2009/|website=HorrorNews.net|publisher=Horror  News|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Worst Kept Secret Tour''' is the second official tour from American girl-group [[Fifth Harmony]] and the third overall. The tour began in [[Ventura, California]] on February 2, 2014 and ended on March 24, 2014 in [[Buffalo, New York]]. The group performed in this tour around the same time when they were opening acts for [[Demi Lovato]]'s '[[Neon Lights Tour]]'. The official poster for this tour was chosen by Fifth Harmony among many nominations submitted by fans. The tour was planned as an early tour for fans who were going to see the group in Demi Lovato's 'Neon Light's Tour'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.j-14.com/posts/fifth-harmony-announces-a-secret-tour-for-their-fans-17820|title=Fifth Harmony Announces a Secret Tour For Their Fans!|work= J-14!}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''USS ''Newport News'' (SSN-750)''', a {{sclass-|Los Angeles|submarine}}, was the third ship of the [[United States Navy]] to be named for [[Newport News, Virginia]].

==Construction==
The contract to build her was awarded to [[Northrop Grumman Newport News|Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company]] in [[Newport News, Virginia]] on 19 April 1982 and her keel was laid down on 3 March 1984.  She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 15 March 1986 sponsored by [[Paul S. Trible, Jr.|Mrs. Rosemary D. Trible]], and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 3 June 1989. Mayor [[Jessie M. Rattley]] presented the ship with a commemorative plaque containing the poem "Newport News," written by Newport News native Ronald W. Bell, whose poem "[[Hyman G. Rickover|Admiral Rickover]]" also appears upon a plaque aboard the ''Los Angeles'' class submarine {{USS|Hyman G. Rickover|SSN-709|2}}.Ref: Naval Submarine Base, Groton, Ct. The poem appears on this page with permission from the author:{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} ref: Sub Squadron 8, NOB, Norfolk

{{poemquote|
::"Newport News"

Harbor of a thousand ships
Forger of a nation's fleet
Gateway to the New World
Where ocean and river meet
Strength wrought from steel
And a people's fortitude
Such is the timeless legacy
Of a place called Newport News.}}

==Initial operations==
''Newport News'' returned to [[Norfolk, Virginia]], following a six-month overseas deployment that included operations in the Middle East. In support of Operation Iraqi Freedom she launched 19 UGM-109C Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles in March 2003.  She deployed in August 2004, first to take part in joint operations with allied navies in the North Atlantic, then to the U.S. Central Command area of operations "in support of national security interests and the global war on terrorism."{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

==Collision with Japanese ship==
On 8 January 2007, ''Newport News'' was operating submerged in the [[Arabian Sea]] south of the [[Straits of Hormuz]] when it hit the Japanese tanker ''Mogamigawa''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/asiapcf/01/08/japan.us.ship/index.html U.S. sub collides with Japan ship], CNN, 8 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; She had been operating as part of Carrier Strike Group 8 (CSG-8),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=24919 Eisenhower Strike Group Completes JTFEX 06-2]&lt;/ref&gt; organized around the [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Dwight D. Eisenhower|CVN-69|3}}. The Carrier Strike Group was redeploying to the Indian Ocean to support a maritime cordon during the [[War in Somalia (2006–2009)|war in Somalia]] when the incident happened.&lt;ref name=US-STRIKE-IN-SOMALIA-TARGETS-AL-QAEDA-FIGURE&gt;{{cite news

''Newport News'' was escorted from the mouth of the Straits of Hormuz to Bahrain by the [[Guided Missile Destroyer]] {{USS|Benfold|DDG-65|2}}. This was due to the fact that the submarine was unable to transit submerged and has no surface defense capabilities. During the transit, Iranian aircraft and warships shadowed the ships.
An official of the Kawasaki Kisen Company (or [[K Line]]), which owns the tanker, announced that
''Mogamigawa''{{'}}s hull and propellers were damaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|date=11 January 2007
|agency=[[Information Telegraph Agency of Russia]]
|accessdate=11 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a Navy spokesman, the collision occurred as a result of the [[venturi effect]].  The tanker drove over the area where the submarine was submerged and this created a sucking effect that forced the submarine upward to the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The incident was the third collision between a U.S. nuclear-powered submarine and a Japanese civilian ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Kiroku Hanai|title=U.S. presence vs. the public will|work=[[Japan Times]]|date=23 January 2007|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/eo20070123kh.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 January, after the boat returned to Bahrain for repairs, administrative personnel actions ([[Admiral's Mast]]) were taken against several members of her crew, which included relieving the boat's commanding officer, Commander Matthew A. Weingart, of command due to a lack of confidence in his ability to command.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

On 10 April the Iranian [[Fars News Agency]] reported that ''Newport News'' has been leaking radioactive and chemical pollution in the Persian Gulf and claimed that following this formal complaint, the ship departed the gulf for a complete overhaul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''Vindadhhurmuzd''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: هرمز ونداد), also known by the more correct form of '''Vandad Hormozd''' (ونداد هرمزد), was the ruler of the [[Qarinvand dynasty]] from 765 to 809.

== Background ==
In 760, during the reign of Vandad Hormozd's unnamed father, the [[Dabuyids]], under [[Khurshid of Tabaristan]], revolted against the [[Abbasid Caliphate]]. Khurshid was defeated, however, and fled to [[Daylam]]. From there he launched a counterattack against the Abbasids, but was once again defeated. After learning that his family was captured by the Abbasids, Khurshid poisoned himself.&lt;ref name="EI2"&gt;Rekaya (1986), pp. 68–70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Madelung200"&gt;Madelung (1975), p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pourshariati317"&gt;Pourshariati (2008), p. 317&lt;/ref&gt; This marked the end of the Dabuyid dynasty, but the other local dynasties such as the Qarinvands, [[Bavandids]] and [[Zarmihrids]], who were all formerly subject to the Dabuyids, continued to control parts of Tabaristan, as tributary vassals of the Abbasid government.

== Biography ==
[[File:Caspian coast of Iran during the Iranian intermezzo.png|thumb|right|300px|Map of northern Iran]]
In 765, Vandad Hormozd became the ruler of the Qarinvand dynasty. In 772, [[Khalid ibn Barmak]], the Abbasid governor of Tabaristan, left the region. Shortly after Khalid's departure, Vandad Hormozd sent the Bavand ruler [[Sharwin I]] a letter which urged him to revolt against the Abbasids. Sharwin I accepted,&lt;ref name="IbnIsfandiyar911"&gt;Ibn Isfandiyar, p. 128-132&lt;/ref&gt; and along with Vandad Hormozd, and the Zarmihrid ruler, rose in revolt. They then began destroying the cities built by the Muslims in the region, and in 782, Sharwin I along with Vandad Hormozd exterminated all the Muslims in Tabaristan. During the same period, Vandad Hormozd assumed the Dabuyid title of ''Gilgilan'',&lt;ref&gt;''The Minor Dynasties of Northern Iran'', C.E. Bosworth, '''The Cambridge History of Iran''', Vol. 4, ed. W. Madelung, (Cambridge University Press, 1975), 201.&lt;/ref&gt; while Sharwin I assumed the title of ''[[Padishkhwargar|Padashwargarshah]]'' ("king of the mountains").&lt;ref name="MadelungBavand"&gt;Madelung (1984), pp. 747–753&lt;/ref&gt; The Abbasid caliph [[al-Mahdi]], who had received the news about the Zoroastrian revolt in Tabaristan, sent one of his most distinguished officers, named [[Salim of Farghana]], against the rebels, but Vandad Hormozd, with the aid of his brother Vinda-Umid, managed to defeat and kill Salim.&lt;ref name="IbnIsfandiyar911"/&gt; Al-Mahdi then sent Firasha, who was also defeated, captured and executed by Vandad Hormozd.

Vandad Hormozd continued to repel successive Arab invasions of Tabaristan until 785, when he and the other native rulers of Tabaristan were finally defeated, and once again agreed to pay tribute to the Abbasid caliphs.

In 805, the Abbasid caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]] visited [[Ray, Iran|Ray]], where he met Vandad Hormozd and Sharwin I, who assured their submission to him and promised to pay tax. In order to ensure their loyalty, Harun took Sharwin's grandson [[Shahriyar I]] and Vandad Hormozd's son [[Qarin ibn Vindadhhurmuzd]] as hostages to [[Baghdad]]. The two princes were allowed to return to Tabaristan after Harun al-Rashid's death four years later.&lt;ref&gt;''The Minor Dynasties of Northern Iran'', C.E. Bosworth, '''The Cambridge History of Iran''', Vol. 4, ed. W. Madelung, (Cambridge University Press, 1975), 204.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vandad Hormozd died in 809, and was succeeded by his son Qarin ibn Vindadhhurmuzd.

It is also called the '''Jacobite War in Ireland''' or the '''Williamite–Jacobite War in Ireland'''.

The cause of the war was the deposition of James as King of the Three Kingdoms in the "[[Glorious Revolution]]" of 1688. James was supported by the mostly Catholic "Jacobites" in Ireland and hoped to use the country as a base to regain his Three Kingdoms. He was given military support by France to this end. For this reason, the war became part of a wider European conflict known as the [[Nine Years' War]] (or War of the Grand Alliance). Some Protestants of the [[Church of Ireland|established Church in Ireland]] also fought on the side of King James.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Tim. ''Revolution: The Great Crisis of the British Monarchy 1685–1720''. Allen Lane (2006). pp. 435–436.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hayton, David. ''Ruling Ireland, 1685–1742: Politics, Politicians and Parties''. Boydell Press (2004). p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

James was opposed in Ireland by the mostly Protestant "Williamites", who were concentrated in the north of the country. William landed a multi-national force in Ireland, composed of English, Scottish, Dutch, Danish and other troops, to put down Jacobite resistance. James left Ireland after a reverse at the [[Battle of the Boyne]] in 1690 and the Irish Jacobites were finally defeated after the [[Battle of Aughrim]] in 1691.

William defeated Jacobitism in Ireland and subsequent [[Jacobite risings]] were confined to Scotland and England. However, the War was to have a lasting effect on Ireland, confirming British and Protestant rule over the country for over two centuries. The iconic Williamite victories of the [[Siege of Derry]] and the [[Battle of the Boyne]] are [[Orange walk|still celebrated]] by (mostly [[Ulster Protestant]]) [[unionist (Ireland)|unionist]]s in [[Ireland]] today.

==Glorious Revolution==
{{main|Glorious Revolution}}

The war in Ireland began as a direct consequence of the [[Glorious Revolution]] in England.  [[James II of England|James II of England and Ireland, VII of Scotland]], who was a [[Roman Catholic]], attempted to introduce freedom of religion for Catholics and bypass the [[English Parliament]] to introduce unpopular laws. For many in England, this was an unpleasant reminder of the rule of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], whose conflict with the Parliament led to the outbreak of the [[English Civil War]]. The breaking point in James' relationship with the English political class came in June 1688 when his second wife gave birth to a son, which opened the prospect of an enduring Catholic [[Stuart dynasty]]. This fear led some political figures to conspire to invite [[William III of England|William III]], [[stadtholder]] of the main provinces of the [[Dutch Republic]] and husband of James’ daughter Mary Stuart, to invade England.&lt;ref name=Murtagh&gt;[http://www.historyireland.com/penal-laws/the-williamite-war-1689-9111/ Murtagh, Harman. "The Williamite War 1689-91", History Ireland]&lt;/ref&gt; William had indicated that such an invitation would be a condition for a military intervention, which he desired primarily for military and strategic reasons.

[[File:King James II by Sir Godfrey Kneller, Bt.jpg|thumb|left|170px|'''James II and VII''' &lt;br /&gt;King of England, Scotland, and Ireland]]
The Dutch Republic was at the brink of war with the France of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], then the greatest military power in Europe. English Stuart Kings [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] and James II had fostered a close alliance with France since the [[English Restoration]], and William wanted to detach England's resources of men, money, and arms from France and put them at the disposal of his [[League of Augsburg]].&lt;ref name=Murtagh/&gt;

William invaded England in November 1688. William's invasion fleet was aided by favourable weather (the "Protestant wind") that gave him [[weather gage]] over the British fleet, allowing him to outmaneuver them and land unopposed. William landed at [[Brixham]] on 5 November 1688 with 18,000 troops.&lt;ref name=Murtagh/&gt; James fled to France after putting up only a token resistance. In 1689, Prince William and his wife Princess Mary Stuart became co-regents as [[William III of England|King William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Queen Mary II]] of England.

Assumed James' thrones in the "Glorious Revolution" of 1689, with the support of the mainly Protestant "Williamites", but had to fight to subdue the Jacobite stronghold of Ireland in 1689–91.]]
However, while James II was unpopular in England, he had widespread popular support in Ireland. The Irish were almost all [[Roman Catholics]] and had [[Irish Confederate Wars|fought en masse]] for the Stuart dynasty in the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]] in the 1640s, in the hope of securing religious toleration and political self-government. They had been defeated by 1652 and were punished by the [[English Commonwealth]] regime with land confiscations and penal legislation. They were largely disappointed with the failure of [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] to completely reverse this situation in the [[Act of Settlement 1662]].

The majority of Irish people were "Jacobites" and supported James II due to his 1687 [[Declaration of Indulgence]] or, as it is also known, the Declaration for the Liberty of Conscience, that granted religious freedom to all denominations in England and Scotland and also due to James II's promise to the Irish Parliament of an eventual right to self-determination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Tim|last=Harris|title=Revolution: The Great Crisis of the British Monarchy, 1685–1720|location=London|publisher=Allen Lane|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7139-9759-0|page=440}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.jstor.org/pss/30064327|title=A 'Beleaguered Protestant'?: Walter Harris and the Writing of ''Fiction Unmasked'' in Mid-18th-Century Ireland|first=Eoin|last=Magennis|pages=6–111|journal=Eighteenth-Century Ireland|volume=13|year=1998|accessdate=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James had given them some concrete concessions in the 1680s by appointing an Irish Catholic, [[Richard Talbot, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell]] as [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]], and by re-admitting Catholics as Army officers and into other public offices. When James fled England in 1688 he looked to Ireland to muster support for a re-conquest of his Three Kingdoms. In 1689 he held what became known as the "[[Patriot Parliament]]" in Dublin, which reversed the confiscations of the 1650s and confirmed his support from most of the Irish landed gentry.

Ironically, while Irish Catholics supported King James en masse, the [[Papal States]] had joined the [[Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg)|League of Augsburg]]. [[Pope Innocent XI]] had lent William of Orange 150,000 [[Italian scudo|Scudi]] for war purposes through his family's bank before his death in 1689.&lt;ref&gt;This aspect was then hidden from Irish Catholics and Protestants for over three centuries; see: [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1582334/Vatican-forced-us-out-of-Italy-claim-authors.html ''Telegraph'' article, March 2008&lt;] and [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/a-papal-mystery-827008.html ''Independent'' article, May 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaign in Ulster==

After William's landing in England, James' Lord Deputy in Ireland, [[Richard Talbot, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell]] took action to ensure that all strong points in Ireland were held by garrisons of the newly recruited Irish Catholic army, loyal to James. The northern province of [[Ulster]], which had the heaviest concentration of English and Scottish settlers, was the only part of Ireland where Talbot encountered significant resistance. An attempted rising by the Protestant inhabitants of [[Bandon, County Cork|Bandon]] in [[County Cork]] was [[Capture of Bandon|quickly defeated]] by Jacobite forces.

By November 1688, only the walled city of [[Derry]] had a Protestant garrison. A Jacobite army of around 1,200 men, mostly "''Redshanks''" ([[Scottish Highlands|slang for kilt-wearing Highlanders]]), under [[Alexander MacDonnell, 3rd Earl of Antrim]], was slowly organised (they set out on the week William of Orange landed in England). When they arrived on 7 December 1688 the gates were closed against them and the [[Siege of Derry]] began. While the Jacobites appeared to have great advantages in terms of numbers in Ireland, in fact, the troops raised by Tyrconnell were mainly hastily conscripted peasant bands, most of them poorly armed and trained. Nevertheless, a Jacobite force under [[Richard Hamilton (officer)|Richard Hamilton]] routed a Protestant Williamite militia in an encounter at [[Dromore, County Down]] (known as the [[Break of Dromore]]) on 14 March 1689 and occupied eastern Ulster.

[[File:Map of Ireland - Williamite War.gif|thumb|250px|left|Map of Ireland showing the major battles of the war]]

When James was deposed and fled to France, Louis XIV (already at [[War of the Grand Alliance|war]] with William of Orange) supported him with troops and money to help him regain his crown, though he stipulated that the French troops he sent to Ireland would have to be made good by the sending of the same number of Irish recruits to France.

On 12 March 1689 James landed in [[Kinsale]], Ireland, with a force of 2,500 men under the command of [[Conrad von Rosen|de Rosen]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libraryireland.com/biography/KingJamesII.php|title=King James II.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He first marched on [[Dublin]], where he was well received and, with a Jacobite army of Catholics, Protestant Royalists and French, then marched north, joining the [[Siege of Derry]] on 18 April. James found himself leading a predominantly Irish Catholic movement, and on 7 May he presided over an Irish Parliament composed almost entirely of Catholic gentry. He reluctantly agreed to the Parliament's demand for an Act declaring that the Parliament of England had no right to pass laws for Ireland. He also agreed, again reluctantly, to restore to Irish Catholics the lands confiscated from their families after the [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland]], by confiscating the lands of those (predominantly Protestants) who opposed him and supported William. This parliament was later named the [[Patriot Parliament]] by Irish nationalists.

British Williamite warships arrived off [[Derry]] to relieve the besieged city on 11 June, but refused to risk shore guns until, ordered by Marshal Frederic Schomberg, they broke through and ended the siege on 28 July 1689.

In [[Enniskillen]], 53 miles south of Derry, armed Williamite civilians drawn from the local Protestant population organised a formidable irregular military force. Operating with Enniskillen as a base, they carried out raids against the Jacobite forces in [[Connacht]] and [[Ulster]]. A poorly trained Jacobite army led by [[Justin MacCarthy, Viscount Mountcashel]] assembled at [[Dublin]] and marched against them. On 28 July 1689, MacCarthy's force was defeated at the [[Battle of Newtownbutler]]. Many of the Jacobite troops fled as the first shots were fired, and up to 1500 of them were hacked down or drowned when pursued by the Williamite cavalry. Partly as a result of this defeat and partly because of a major Williamite landing in the east of the province, most Jacobite troops were withdrawn from Ulster and encamped near [[Dundalk]].

==Schomberg's campaign==
On 13 August 1689 William's army under Marshal [[Frederick Schomberg, 1st Duke of Schomberg]] landed at Ballyholme Bay in [[County Down]] and, after [[Siege of Carrickfergus (1689)|capturing Carrickfergus]], marched unopposed to [[Dundalk]]. James's viceroy Tyrconnell, commanding the main Jacobite army, blocked Schomberg's passage southwards but did not give battle. The two armies remained encamped opposite each other in cold, wet weather for several weeks before they withdrew to winter quarters. The Williamites lost several thousand men from disease in this campaign, even though they did not fight a single major engagement with the Jacobites. Moreover, they found themselves harassed throughout the winter of 1689 and in the following two years by Irish Catholic [[guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]] known as ''[[rapparees]]''. Schomberg's troops continued to die from disease in their winter quarters because of the harsh weather and poor food supplies. The lack of food was partly from bad management, but also because the Jacobites devastated the countryside as they retreated. The local civilian population also suffered terribly from this tactic.

==Battle of the Boyne==
{{main|Battle of the Boyne}}
Impatient with Schomberg's slow progress, William decided to take charge. He arrived with a fleet of 300 ships at [[Belfast Lough]] on 14 June 1690. He landed at Carrickfergus, having mustered an army of 36,000 soldiers (including English, German, Dutch, Danish, and French [[Huguenot]] troops), which then marched south towards Dublin. After some resistance near [[Newry]] the Jacobites withdrew to the south bank of the [[River Boyne]], where they took up a defensive position at the village of [[Oldbridge]], near [[Drogheda]]. On 1 July, William attacked their position, fording the Boyne at several places, forcing the Jacobites to retreat to avoid being surrounded. (As a consequence of the adoption of the [[Gregorian calendar]] in 1753, the battle is now commemorated on 12 July).

The [[Battle of the Boyne]] was not militarily decisive and casualties on both sides were not high—around 1500 Jacobites and 500 Williamites were killed. However, it proved enough to collapse James's confidence in victory in Ireland. He rode ahead of his army to [[Duncannon]], and from there returned to exile in France. Because he deserted his Irish supporters, James became known in Ireland as {{lang|ga|Séamus an Chaca}} or ''James the Shit''.&lt;ref&gt;Eamonn O Ciardha, Ireland and the Jacobite Cause – A fatal attachment, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; The battle was lost but not the war. James's illegitimate son [[James Fitzjames, 1st Duke of Berwick]] wrote in his memoirs that he fled to muster fresh French support .&lt;ref&gt;Stephen McGarry, Irish Brigades Abroad, p.53&lt;/ref&gt; The Jacobite army retreated to Dublin, little damaged but demoralised and badly hit by desertion. The next day, they abandoned the city and marched to [[Limerick]]. The Williamites marched into Ireland's capital on the same day and occupied the city without a fight. On 27 July, Jacobites in Scotland secured a victory by routing a Williamite army at the [[Battle of Killiecrankie]].

William's victory at the Boyne, together with James' flight, might have been the end of the war in Ireland. However, William published very harsh peace terms in the [[Declaration of Finglas]], excluding the Jacobite officers and the Irish Catholic landed class from the pardon he offered to Jacobite foot-soldiers. As a result, Irish Jacobite leaders felt they had no choice but to fight until they received guarantees that their lives, property, and civil and religious rights would be respected in a peace settlement.

==First Siege of Limerick==
[[File:John Castle Limerick-seabhcan.jpg|thumb|left|[[King John's Castle (Limerick)|King John's Castle]] and Thomond Bridge at Limerick City. Limerick was besieged by the Williamites in 1690 and 1691.]]

As a result of Williamite intransigence, the war continued. The Irish Jacobites retreated to [[Limerick]], where they repulsed a [[Siege of Limerick (1690)|Williamite assault]], inflicting heavy casualties, in August 1690. The Williamites retreated from the west of Ireland but consolidated their hold on the south of the country in late 1690. Their forces, under the [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Earl of Marlborough]], took the southern ports of [[Cork (city)|Cork]] and [[Kinsale]]

The Irish Jacobites' position was now defensive, holding a large enclave in western Ireland, including all of the province of [[Connacht]], bounded by the [[River Shannon]]. The Jacobites' successful defence of Limerick encouraged them to believe they could win the war with help from France (though many of the French troops sent with James were withdrawn after his flight). William left Ireland in late 1690, entrusting command of the Williamite forces to the Dutch general [[Godert de Ginkell, 1st Earl of Athlone|Godert de Ginkell]].

==Athlone, Aughrim and the Second Siege of Limerick==
{{main|Battle of Aughrim|Siege of Limerick (1691)}}
[[File:Aughrim cross.jpg|thumb|250px|Memorial cross on the site of the Battle of Aughrim, where 7000 men died on 12 July 1691 and the Jacobite cause in Ireland was defeated]]

Ginkell broke into Connacht via the town of [[Athlone]], after a bloody [[siege of Athlone|siege]] there. He then advanced on the key Jacobite strongholds of [[Galway]] and Limerick. The [[Marquis de St Ruth]], the Jacobite's French commander, attempted to block Ginkell's advance at [[Aughrim, County Galway]], but Ginkell's army inflicted a crushing defeat on the Irish at the [[Battle of Aughrim]], where the Jacobites lost up to 8000 men—about half their army—killed, wounded, or taken prisoner.

St Ruth himself, the Jacobite General, was among the dead. Ginkell took [[Galway]], which surrendered on favourable terms. He went on to besiege [[Limerick]]. The [[Siege of Limerick (1691)|Siege of Limerick]] ended with Irish surrender on 23 September 1691, when [[Patrick Sarsfield]], despairing of any hope of victory, overthrew the French officers in command of the city and opened negotiations with Ginkell.

==Treaty of Limerick==
The peace [[Treaty of Limerick]] signed on 3 October 1691 offered favourable terms to Jacobites willing to stay in Ireland and give an oath of loyalty to William III. Peace was concluded on these terms between Sarsfield and Ginkell, giving toleration to Catholicism and full legal rights to Catholics that swore an oath of loyalty to [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]].

The Protestant-dominated [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] refused to ratify the articles of the Treaty in 1697, and from 1695 on, updated the [[penal laws (Ireland)|penal laws]], which discriminated harshly against Catholics. Catholics saw this as a severe breach of faith. A popular contemporary Irish saying was, {{lang|ga|cuimhnigí Luimneach agus feall na Sassanaigh}} ("remember Limerick and Saxon treachery"). The Papacy was an enemy of Louis of France and therefore did not support James in 1691, but the new Pope [[Pope Innocent XII]] changed its policy to support for France, and therefore James, from 1693. This factor hardened Protestant attitudes towards Catholics and Jacobitism in Ireland.

Part of the treaty agreed to Sarsfield's demand that the Jacobite army could leave Ireland as a body and go to France. Ships were even provided for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Padraig Lenihan, Consolidating Conquest, Ireland 1603–1727&lt;/ref&gt; This event was popularly known in Ireland as the "[[Flight of the Wild Geese]]". Around 14,000 men with around 10,000 women and children left Ireland with Patrick Sarsfield in 1691. Initially, they formed the army in exile of James II, though operating as part of the French army. After James's death, the remnants of this force merged into the French [[Irish Brigade (France)|Irish Brigade]], which had been set up in 1689 from 6,000 Irish recruits sent by the Irish Jacobites in return for French military aid.

==Long-term effects==
The Williamite victory in the war in Ireland had two main long-term results.  The first was that it ensured [[James II of England|James II]] would not regain his thrones in England, Ireland, and Scotland by military means. The second was that it ensured closer British and [[Protestant]] dominance over Ireland.  Until the nineteenth century, Ireland was ruled by what became known as the "[[Protestant Ascendancy]]", the mostly Protestant ruling class.  The majority Irish Catholic community and the [[Ulster-Scots]] [[Presbyterian]] community were systematically excluded from power, which was based on land ownership.

For over a century after the war, Irish Catholics maintained a sentimental attachment to the Jacobite cause, portraying James and the Stuarts as the rightful monarchs who would have given a just settlement to Ireland, including self-government, restoration of confiscated lands and tolerance for Catholicism.  Thousands of Irish soldiers left the country to serve the Stuart monarchs in the [[Irish Brigade (Spanish Civil War)|Spanish]] and [[Irish Brigade (French)|French]] armies.  Until 1766 France and the Papacy remained committed to restoring the Stuarts to their British Kingdoms, at least one composite Irish battalion (500-men) drawn from Irish soldiers in the French service fought on the Jacobite side in the Scottish Jacobite uprisings up to the [[Battle of Culloden]] in 1746.

Protestants, on the other hand, portrayed the Williamite victory as a triumph for religious and civil liberty. Triumphant murals of King William still controversially [[Murals_in_Northern_Ireland#Unionist|adorn gable walls in Ulster]], and the defeat of the Catholics in the Williamite war are still commemorated by Protestant [[Unionist (Ireland)|Unionists]], by the [[Orange Institution|Orange Order]] on the [[Twelfth of July]].
