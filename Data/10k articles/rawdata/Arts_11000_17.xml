{{French art history}}

'''17th-century French art''' is generally referred to as [[Baroque]], but from the mid to late 17th century, the style of French art shows a [[classicism|classical]] adherence to certain rules of proportion and sobriety uncharacteristic of the Baroque as it was practiced in most of the rest of Europe during the same period.

== Louis XIII style ==
{{main|Louis XIII style}}
In the early part of the 17th century, late [[Mannerism|mannerist]] and early [[Baroque]] tendencies continued to flourish in the court of [[Marie de' Medici]] and [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]].  Art from this period shows influences from both the north of Europe (Dutch and Flemish schools) and from Roman painters of the [[Counter-Reformation]].  Artists in France frequently debated the merits between [[Peter Paul Rubens]] (the Flemish baroque, voluptuous lines and colors) and [[Nicolas Poussin]] (rational control, proportion, Roman classicism).

There was also a strong [[Caravaggio]] school represented in the period by the candle-lit paintings of [[Georges de La Tour]].  The wretched and the poor were featured in an almost Dutch manner in the paintings by the three [[Le Nain]] brothers.  In the paintings of [[Philippe de Champaigne]] there are both propagandistic portraits of [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]]' s minister [[Cardinal Richelieu]] and other more contemplative portraits of people in the [[Jansenist]] sect.

== Residential architecture ==
{{Main|French baroque architecture}}

However, under [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], the Baroque as it was practiced in Italy was not in French taste ([[Bernini]]'s famous proposal for redesigning the Louvre was rejected by Louis XIV.)  Through [[propaganda]], wars and great architectural works, [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] launched a vast program designed for the glorification of France and his name.  The [[Palace of Versailles]], initially a tiny hunting lodge built by his father, was transformed by Louis XIV into a marvelous palace for fêtes and parties.  Architect [[Louis Le Vau]], painter and designer [[Charles Le Brun]] and the landscape architect [[André Le Nôtre]] created marvels : fountains danced; wandering revelers discovered hidden grottos in the gardens.

The initial impetus for this transformation of Versailles is generally linked to the private château [[Vaux-le-Vicomte]] built for Louis XIV's minister of Finance [[Nicolas Fouquet]].  Having offered a lavish festival for the king in the newly finished residence in 1661 (Le Brun, Le Vau, Le Nôtre, the poet [[La Fontaine]], the playwright [[Molière]] were all under Fouquet's patronage), the minister was accused of misappropriation of funds and was sentenced to life imprisonment.  The architects and artists under his patronage were all put to work on Versailles.

[[Image:Chateau-de-versailles-cour.jpg|none|thumb|340px|Versailles: [[Louis Le Vau]]'s ''cour d'honneur'']]

==The court of Louis XIV==
{{main|Style Louis XIV}}
In this period, Louis' minister [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] established royal control over [[artisan]]al production in France; henceforth France would no longer purchase luxury goods from abroad, but would, herself, set the standard for quality. This control was also seen in the creation of an academy of painting and sculpture, which maintained a [[hierarchy of genres]] in painting (the "noblest," according to [[André Félibien]] in 1667, being [[history painting]]), a strong use of pictorial [[rhetoric]], and a strict sense of decorum in subject matter.{{Citation needed|reason=May 30, 2008|date=May 2008}}

Furnishings and [[interior design]]s from this period are referred to as ''Louis XIV-style''; the style is characterized by weighty [[brocade]]s of red and gold, thickly [[gilding|gilded]] [[plaster]] [[molding (decorative)|molding]], large sculpted [[sideboard]]s, and heavy [[marble|marbling]].{{Citation needed|reason=May 30, 2008|date=May 2008}}

In 1682 Versailles was transformed into the official residence of the king; eventually the [[Hall of Mirrors (Palace of Versailles)|Hall of Mirrors]] was built; other smaller ''[[château]]x'', like the [[Grand Trianon]], were built on the grounds, and a huge [[canal]] featuring [[gondola]]s and gondoliers from [[Venice]] was created.

Through his wars and the glory of Versailles, Louis became, to a certain degree, the arbiter of taste and power in Europe and both his ''château'' and the etiquette in Versailles were copied by the other European courts.  Yet the difficult wars at the end of his long reign and the religious problems created by the [[revocation of the Edict of Nantes]] made his last years dark ones.{{Citation needed|reason=May 30, 2008|date=May 2008}}

[[Image:Bayon Angkor Relief1.jpg|Stone bas-relief at [[Bayon]] temple depicting the [[Khmer Empire|Khmer]] army at war with the [[Cham (Asia)|Cham]], carved c. 1200 CE|thumb]]
The history of '''Cambodian art''' stretches back centuries to ancient times, but the most famous period is undoubtedly the '''Khmer art''' of the [[Khmer Empire]] (802–1431), especially in the area around [[Angkor]] and the mainly 12th-century temple-complex of [[Angkor Wat]], initially [[Hindu]] and subsequently [[Buddhist]]. After the collapse of the empire these and other sites were abandoned and overgrown, allowing much of the era's stone carving and architecture to survive to the present day.  Traditional Cambodian arts and crafts include [[textiles]], non-textile [[weaving]], [[silversmithing]], [[stone carving]], [[lacquerware]], [[Ceramic art|ceramics]], [[wat]] [[murals]], and [[kite]]-making.  

Beginning in the mid-20th century, a tradition of modern art began in Cambodia, though in the later 20th century both traditional and modern arts declined for several reasons, including the killing of artists by the [[Khmer Rouge]].  The country has experienced a recent artistic revival due to increased support from governments, NGOs, and foreign tourists.

In pre-colonial Cambodia, art and crafts were generally produced either by rural non-specialists for practical use or by skilled artists producing works for the Royal Palace.  In modern Cambodia, many artistic traditions entered a period of decline or even ceased to be practiced, but the country has experienced a recent artistic revival as the tourist market has increased and governments and NGOs have contributed to the preservation of Cambodian culture.

==Stone carving==
{{Main|Khmer sculpture}}
[[Image:Fronton Cambodge Musée Guimet 9972.jpg|Stone carving at [[Banteay Srei]], an [[Angkor]]ian temple consecrated in 967 CE.|thumb]]
Cambodia's best-known stone carving adorns the temples of [[Angkor]], which are "renowned for the scale, richness and detail of their sculpture". In modern times, however, the art of stone carving became rare, largely because older sculptures survived undamaged for centuries (eliminating the need for replacements) and because of the use of cement molds for modern temple architecture.  By the 1970s and 1980s, the craft of stone carving was nearly lost.&lt;ref name=carving&gt;Visiting Arts (2005), [http://www.culturalprofiles.net/cambodia/Directories/Cambodia_Cultural_Profile/-1828.html "Stone carving"].&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 20th century, however, efforts to restore Angkor resulted in a new demand for skilled stone carvers to replace missing or damaged pieces, and a new tradition of stone carving is arising to meet this need. Most modern carving is traditional-style, but some carvers are experimenting with contemporary designs.  Interest is also renewing for using stone carving in modern wats.  Modern carvings are typically made from [[Banteay Meanchey]] [[sandstone]], though stone from [[Pursat]] and [[Kampong Thom City|Kompong Thom]] is also used.&lt;ref name=carving/&gt;

==Murals==

Retrieved 30 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; few historic [[wat]] [[mural]]s remain in Cambodia. In the 1960s, art historians Guy and Jacqueline Nafilyan photographed 19th-century murals, providing a record of this lost cultural heritage. The best known surviving murals are at the [[Silver Pagoda]] in [[Phnom Penh]], [[Wat Rajabo]] in [[Siem Reap province]], and [[Wat Kompong Tralach Leu]] in [[Kompong Chhnang Province]]. In the last decade, wat murals have seen a resurgence, but Cambodia's surviving older murals are generally more refined and detailed.

==Textiles==
[[Image:Pidan textile.jpg|19th century silk ''[[Pidan (textile)|pidan]]''|thumb]]
[[Image:Cambodia weaving.jpg|Cambodian woman weaving silk near [[Siem Reap]], 2007|thumb]]
[[Silk]] [[weaving]] in Cambodia has a long history. The practice dates to as early as the 1st century, and textiles were used in trade during [[Angkor]]ian times. Even modern textile production evidences these historic antecedents: motifs found on silk today often echo clothing details on ancient stone sculptures.&lt;ref name=silk&gt;Visiting Arts (2005), [http://www.culturalprofiles.net/cambodia/Directories/Cambodia_Cultural_Profile/-1821.html "Silk weaving"].&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two main types of Cambodian weaving.  The [[ikat]] technique (Khmer: ''chong kiet''), which produces patterned fabric, is quite complex.  To create patterns, weavers tie-dye portions of [[weft]] yarn before weaving begins.  Patterns are diverse and vary by region; common motifs include lattice, stars, and spots.  The second weaving technique, unique to Cambodia, is called "uneven [[twill]]". It yields single or two-color fabrics, which are produced by weaving three threads so that the "color of one thread dominates on one side of the fabric, while the two others determine the colour on the reverse side."&lt;ref name=silk/&gt; Traditionally, Cambodian textiles have employed natural dyes.  Red dye comes from [[lac]] insect nests, blue dye from [[indigo]], yellow and green dye from [[prohut]] bark, and black dye from [[ebony]] bark.&lt;ref name=silk/&gt;

Cambodia's modern silk-weaving centers are [[Takeo]], [[Battambang]], [[Beanteay Meanchey]], [[Siem Reap]] and [[Kampot Province|Kampot]] provinces.    Silk-weaving has seen a major revival recently, with production doubling over the past ten years. This has provided employment for many rural women. Cambodian silk is generally sold domestically, where it is used in ''[[sampot]]'' (wrap skirts), furnishings, and ''[[pidan (textile)|pidan]]'' (pictoral tapestries), but interest in international trade is increasing.&lt;ref name=silk/&gt;

[[Cotton]] textiles have also played a significant role in Cambodian culture. Though today Cambodia imports most of its cotton, traditionally woven cotton remains popular. Rural women often weave homemade cotton fabric, which is used in garments and for household purposes. [[Krama]], the traditional check scarves worn almost universally by Cambodians, are made of cotton.&lt;ref&gt;Visiting Arts (2005), [http://www.culturalprofiles.net/cambodia/Directories/Cambodia_Cultural_Profile/-1827.html "Cotton weaving (tbanh ambas)"].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-textile weaving==
Many Cambodian farmers [[basket weaving|weave baskets]] (Khmer: tbanh kantrak) for household use or as a supplemental source of income.  Most baskets are made of thinly cut bamboo.  Regions known for basketry include [[Siem Reap]] and [[Kampong Cham Province|Kampong Cham]].&lt;ref&gt;Visiting Arts (2005), [http://www.culturalprofiles.net/cambodia/Directories/Cambodia_Cultural_Profile/-1824.html "Basket weaving (tbanh kantrak)"].&lt;/ref&gt; Mat weaving (tbanh kantuel) is a common seasonal occupation. They are most commonly made from reeds, either left a natural tan color or dyed in deep jewel tones. The region of Cambodia best known for mat weaving is the Mekong floodplain, especially around [[Lvea Em]] district. Mats are commonly laid out for guests and are important building materials for homes.&lt;ref&gt;Visiting Arts (2005), [http://www.culturalprofiles.net/cambodia/Directories/Cambodia_Cultural_Profile/-1825.html "Mat weaving (tbanh kantuel)"].&lt;/ref&gt; Wicker and rattan crafts (tbanh kanchoeu) made from [[dryandra]] trees are also significant.  Common wicker and rattan products include walls, mats, furniture, and other household items.&lt;ref&gt;Visiting Arts (2005), [http://www.culturalprofiles.net/cambodia/Directories/Cambodia_Cultural_Profile/-1826.html "Wicker and rattan (tbanh kanchoeu)"].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lacquerware==
[[Image:Cambodia lacquerware.jpg|A Cambodian woman works on a lacquered vase|thumb]]
The height of Cambodian traditional [[lacquerware]] was between the 12th and 16th centuries; some examples of work from this era, including gilded Buddha images and [[betel]] boxes, have survived to the present day.  Lacquerware was traditionally colored black using burnt wood, representing the underworld; red using mercury, representing the earth; and yellow using arsenic, representing the heavens.  Lacquer on Angkorian stone dates to the 15th or 16th century.&lt;ref name=lacquer&gt;Visiting Arts (2005), [http://www.culturalprofiles.net/cambodia/Directories/Cambodia_Cultural_Profile/-1829.html "Lacquerware"].&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern Cambodia, the art of lacquerwork nearly faded into oblivion: few lacquer trees survived, and lacquer was unavailable in local markets.  Today's revival is still in its infancy, but 100 lacquer artists have been trained by a French expert under the guidance of Artisans d'Angkor, a company that produces traditional crafts in village workshops.  Some artists are "beginning to experiment with different techniques and styles...to produce modern and striking effects."&lt;ref name=lacquer/&gt;

==Silversmithing==
[[Image:Bowl cambodia.jpg|Lotus-shaped Cambodian bowl (gold and silver alloy), made c. 1222 CE|thumb]]
Silversmithing in Cambodia dates back centuries.  The Royal Palace traditionally patronized silversmiths' workshops, and silversmiths remain concentrated at [[Kompong Luong]], near the former royal capital [[Oudong]].  Silver was made into a variety of items, including weaponry, coins, ceremonial objects used in funerary and religious rituals, and betel boxes.  During Cambodia's colonial period, artisans at the School of Fine Art produced celebrated silverwork, and by the late 1930s there were more than 600 silversmiths. Today, silverwork is popular for boxes, jewellery, and souvenir items; these are often adorned with fruit, fire, and Angkor-inspired motifs.  Men produce most of the forms for such work, but women often complete the intricate filigree.&lt;ref&gt;Visiting Arts (2005), [http://www.culturalprofiles.net/cambodia/Directories/Cambodia_Cultural_Profile/-1822.html "Silversmithing"].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ceramics==
Cambodian pottery traditions date to 5000 BCE.  Ceramics were mostly used for domestic purposes such as holding food and water. There is no evidence that Khmer ceramics were ever exported, though ceramics were imported from elsewhere in Asia beginning in the 10th century. Ceramics in the shape of birds, elephants, rabbits, and other animals were popular between the 11th and 13th centuries.&lt;ref name=ceramics&gt;Visiting Arts (2005), [http://www.culturalprofiles.net/cambodia/Directories/Cambodia_Cultural_Profile/-1823.html "Ceramics"].&lt;/ref&gt;

Potting traditionally was done either on a [[pottery wheel]] or using shaping tools such as paddles and anvils. Firing was done in clay kilns, which could reach temperatures of 1,000–1,200 °C, or in the open air, at temperatures of around 700 °C. Primarily green and brown glazes were used.  In rural Cambodia, traditional pottery methods remained.  Many pieces are hand-turned and fired on an open fire without glaze.  The country's major center for pottery is [[Kompong Chhnang Province]].&lt;ref name=ceramics/&gt;

In modern Cambodia, the art of glazed ceramics faded into oblivion: the technique of stoneware stop to be used around 14th century, at the end of Angkor era. Today this technique begin a slow revival through a Belgian ceramist who founded the [[Khmer Ceramics &amp; Fine Arts Centre|Khmer Ceramics &amp; Fine Arts Center]], in Siem Reap, the organization lead vocational training and researches about this lost skill.

==Kites==
Cambodia's kite-making and kite-flying tradition, which dates back many centuries, was revived in the early 1990s and is now extremely popular throughout the country. Kites (Khmer: khleng ek) are generally flown at night during the northeast monsoon season. A bow attached to the kites resonates in the wind, producing a musical sound.&lt;ref&gt;Visiting Arts (2005), [http://www.culturalprofiles.net/cambodia/Directories/Cambodia_Cultural_Profile/-1866.html "Kite Making"].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern and contemporary visual arts==

Cambodia's tradition of modern (representational) drawing, painting, and sculpture was established in the late 1940s at the School of Cambodian Arts (later called the University of Fine Arts), where it occupied much of the school's curriculum a decade later.  These developments were supported by the government, which encouraged new areas of specialization (e.g. design and modern painting) at the school and purchased modern art for the Prime Minister's residences and for government buildings.  Galleries opened in Phnom Penh during the 1960s, and cultural centers hosted exhibitions of modern paintings and provided art libraries.  One important painter of the 1960s was [[Nhek Dim]]; he has become the painter of reference for modern painters.&lt;ref&gt;Vachon, Michelle. "Painting by famed Nhek Dim returns home", ''The Cambodia Daily'', Phnom Penh, 20 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  During the subsequent Khmer Rouge era, many artists were killed and art production nearly ceased.&lt;ref name=modern&gt;Visiting Arts (2005), [http://www.culturalprofiles.net/cambodia/Directories/Cambodia_Cultural_Profile/-1792.html "Modern and contemporary visual arts"].&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fall of the Khmer Rouge, artists and professors returned the University of Fine Arts to rebuild arts training.  Socialist Bloc governments sponsored the education of young art students in Poland, Bulgaria, the former Soviet Union, and Hungary during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Other local efforts aimed to re-establish workshops, collect documents, and preserve traditional knowledge.&lt;ref name=modern/&gt;

Though several galleries present changing exhibitions in Phnom Penh, the vast majority of artists cannot support themselves through exhibitions and sales of modern work.  Artists generally earn income from Angkor-inspired art for tourists or from painting commercial signs and large reproductions that in the West would be mechanically produced.&lt;ref name=modern/&gt;

Several broad schools of art exist among modern Cambodian artists.  Some artists, including [[Som Samai]] (a silversmith), [[An Sok]] (a mask-maker), and [[Chet Chan]] (a painter) follow colonial traditions to produce traditional Khmer art.  [[Chhim Sothy]]'s work is also derived from these traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fine Art|first=Angkor|title=Chhim Sothy - Artist|url=http://www.angkorfineart.com/2012/03/09/58/}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Many young artists who studied abroad in the 1980s, including [[Phy Chan Than]], [[Soeung Vannara]], [[Long Sophea]], and [[Prom Sam An]], have presented a modern Khmer art forms combining subjects from Khmer art with Western modernism. Other notable Cambodian artists include Leang Seckon, Pich Sopheap, Svay Ken, Asasax, [http://www.artistdina.com Chhan Dina], Patrick Samnang Mey, Lam Soeung, and Chhorn Bun Son. During the 1990s, Cambodia saw the return of many members of the Khmer diaspora, including several internationally recognized artists.  Among these are [[Marine Ky]] and [[Chath Piersath]].&lt;ref name=modern/&gt;

'''Chilean literature''' refers to all written or [[literature|literary work]] produced in [[Chile]] or by Chilean writers. The literature of Chile is usually written in [[Spanish language|Spanish]].
Chile has a rich literary tradition and has been home to two [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel prize]] winners, the poets [[Gabriela Mistral]] and [[Pablo Neruda]]. It has also seen three winners of the [[Miguel de Cervantes Prize]], considered one of the most important Spanish language literature prizes: the novelist, journalist and diplomat [[Jorge Edwards]] (1998), and the poets [[Gonzalo Rojas]] (2003) and [[Nicanor Parra]] (2011).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisischile.cl/7297/2/chiles-nicanor-parra-wins-prestigious-cervantes-prize-for-literature/News.aspx Chile's Nicanor Parra wins prestigious Cervantes Prize for literature] www.thisischile.cl Thursday, December 01, 2011 retrieved September 17, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chilean literature during conquest and colonial times==
As the native cultures of the territories known today as Chile had no written tradition, (please see [[Mapudungun alphabet]]), Chilean literature was born during the Spanish conquest of the 1500s. The conquistador [[Pedro de Valdivia]] wrote letters to the king, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V (Carlos Primero de España)]], and in one of these letters, of 1554, he admiringly describes the natural beauty and landscape of the country. Along with the conquerors came missionaries to teach and convert the native peoples to Christianity, spreading not only their religion but also their language, writing and other arts and artisan skills.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bib.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/46871175904139940700080/ima0012.htm Crónicas patrias - La Literatura Chilena, bosquejo histórico, desde la colonia hasta nuestros días escrito para "La América Literaria" - Pedro Pablo Figueroa  page 12 to 15, retrieved September 01, 2013] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chilean literature in the time of the [[Conquest of Chile|Spanish conquest]] consisted mainly of chronicles of the war of [[Arauco War|Arauco]]. Most soldiers with the ability to write had to use the sword more often than the pen, so during the conquest and colonisation, the main role of literature was to keep historical records of the campaign. One exception to this, however, was the poem [[La Araucana]], published in Spain in 1569, 1578, and 1589 and also known as "The Araucaniad". La Araucana, written by [[Alonso de Ercilla]], is the most significant epic poem in the modern Spanish language and is one of the most important works of the [[Spanish Golden Age]] (Siglo de Oro), describing the conquest of Chile in [[Hendecasyllable|hendecasyllable verse]]. Later, [[Pedro de Oña]], the first poet born in Chile, published an imitation of Ercilla, "El Arauco domado" or The Tamed Arauco in 1596.

In the 17th and 18th centuries, historical work prevailed, including "Historia del Reino de Chile" (History of the Realm of Chile) by [[Alonso de Góngora Marmolejo]], "Histórica relación del Reino de Chile" (Historical Account of the Realm of Chile) by [[Alonso de Ovalle]]; and "Cautiverio feliz" (Happy Captivity) by [[Francisco Núñez de Pineda y Bascuñán]]. This period also saw scientific writers like [[Juan Ignacio Molina]], who wrote the "Ensayo sobre la Historia Natural de Chile" (An Essay on the Natural History of Chile), and the epic historical poem "El [[Purén]] indómito" (The Indomitable Purén), written by [[Fernando Álvarez de Toledo]].

During the colonial period until the 19th century, literary works written by Chilean nuns spotlighted: there were spiritual letters, diaries, autobiographies and epistolaries; several writers stood out, including [[Tadea de San Joaquín]], [[Úrsula Suárez]] and [[Josefa de los Dolores Peña y Lillo Barbosa|Josefa de los Dolores]], whose works became the best known of its kind in the South American region.&lt;ref&gt;Castro Buarque, Virginia A.

The excitement of the independence movement inspired [[Camilo Henríquez]] to launch "[[La Aurora de Chile]]" (The Dawn of Chile), Chile's first newspaper or printing operation of any kind, mostly covering politics and political philosophy. It was in print from February 13, 1812 to April 1, 1813, at which point it became El Monitor Araucano. The paper had four printed pages with two columns each, and was published weekly, every Thursday.

===Romanticism===

[[Romanticism]] in Chile can be classified in three literary generations, according to the critic [[Cedomil Goic]]: the 1837 generation, the 1842 generation and the 1867 generation, the latter of which had many parallels with realism and is considered by some critics to actually be part of the realist movement.&lt;ref name=MemCh-Romanticismo&gt;{{cite Memoria Chilena

====The generation of 1837====
Made up of writers born between 1800 and 1814 and also known as the "Generación [[Costumbrismo|Costumbrista]]", the 1837 generation developed a literary interpretation of local everyday life and manners.

Its main feature was a special emphasis on observing the picturesque and local, approaching it from a satirical and critical point of view. The group included [[Mercedes Marin del Solar]],&lt;ref name=MemCh-MercedesMarinDelSolar /&gt; [[Vicente Pérez Rosales]] and [[José Joaquín Vallejo]].&lt;ref name=MemCh-Romanticismo1837&gt;{{cite Memoria Chilena

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The 1842 generation====
Made up of writers born between 1815 and 1829, this group was also known as the "Romantic-social" generation. Like their predecessors, they portrayed everyday life but added an extra layer of social critique to their work. The group were influenced by foreign intellectuals in Chile such as [[José Joaquín de Mora]], [[Andrés Bello]], [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento]] and [[Vicente Fidel López]] and made the first attempts to found a characteristically Chilean national literature movement. The poetry of this generation resembled European Romanticism in style and included [[Salvador Sanfuentes]]' "Inami", [[Guillermo Matta Goyenechea]]'s&lt;ref&gt;[http://historiapolitica.bcn.cl/resenas_parlamentarias/wiki/Guillermo_Matta_Goyenechea Guillermo Matta Goyenechea] http://historiapolitica.bcn.cl/ retrieved September 11, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; "Poesías líricas" (Lyrical poems), [[Guillermo Blest Gana]]'s&lt;ref name=MemCh-GuillermoBlestGana&gt;{{Cite Memoria Chilena

In 1886, the Nicaraguan poet [[Rubén Darío]] moved to [[Valparaíso]], Chile, where he stayed with fellow poets Poirier and Eduardo de la Barra. Together they co-authored a sentimental novel titled "Emelina". Although the novel was not an immediate success, Rubén Darío is credited with the re-emergence of Chilean lyric poetry with "Azul" (Blue) in 1888. This was followed by [[Carlos Pezoa Véliz]]' "Entierro de campo" (Country funeral) and "Tarde en el hospital" (Afternoon in the hospital), and [[Manuel Magallanes Moure]]'s&lt;ref name=MemCh-ManuelMagallanesMoure /&gt; "La casa junto al mar" (Seaside house) and others. Carlos Pezoa Véliz only became famous after his early death at the age of 28.

===Realism===

'''The generation of 1867'''

[[Literary realism|Realist]] writers depicted everyday and banal activities and experiences instead of the more traditional romanticized or stylized representations, distinguishing them from their predecessors.&lt;ref name=MemCh-Realismo&gt;{{cite Memoria Chilena

 |archivedate = October 6, 2014
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This movement was made up of writers born between 1830 and 1844. [[Alberto Blest Gana]] is considered a pioneer of realist style in Chile, starting with "Martín Rivas" in 1862, a portrait of the Chilean society of the time. Blest Gana describes what he saw as positive changes in Chilean society, which, at the time, was moving towards capitalism. He believed it was inevitable that local traditions would disappear and be replaced with European customs, and felt that opposition to these changes was old-fashioned and futile. In contrast, fellow writer [[Luis Orrego Luco]] observed the transformations with sadness and denounced the moral consequences of this process of change. The opposing views of Blest Gana and Orrego Luco are the most important representation of the realism movement in Chile.
Other important writers of the generation were [[Daniel Barros Grez]],&lt;ref name=MemCh-DanielBarrosGrez&gt;{{cite Memoria Chilena

During this period, narrative literature advanced more than poetry or drama, although the construction of new theatres encouraged some development in the latter. Important theatres include the Victoria in [[Valparaíso]], inaugurated in 1844, the República in Santiago, inaugurated in 1848, and [[Municipal Theatre of Santiago|Teatro Municipal de Santiago]], inaugurated in 1857.&lt;ref name=Mem-Ch-Romanticismo1867&gt;{{cite Memoria Chilena

==20th century==

===Criollismo===
{{main|Criollismo}}

Also known as [[Costumbrismo]], Criollismo was a literary movement that was active from the end of the 19th century to the first half of the twentieth century. An extension of Realism, it portrayed the scenes, customs and manners of the writer's country, with some hints of patriotism. The first centenary of Chilean independence in 1910 fed the patriotic spirit of the nation and its writers, and saw a renewed emphasis of rural life in contrast to the traditional focus on urban life as the only source and background of stories. In prose literature, [[Baldomero Lillo]]'s "Sub Terra" and "Sub Sole" were among the most important, as well as [[Mariano Latorre]]'s "Zurzulita" and "Cuna de cóndores" (Cradle of [[condor]]s) and [[Federico Gana]]'s "Días de campo" (Country days). Key [[drama]] works included [[Antonio Acevedo Hernández]]' "Árbol Viejo" (Old Tree),  and "Chañarcillo".&lt;ref name=MemCh-Criollismo&gt;{{cite Memoria Chilena

===Chilean poetry 1900–1925===

During the first quarter of twentieth century, a new Chilean literary scene emerged: an [[Avant-garde]] movement.
The first manifestation of this movement was "Flores de cardo" (Thistle flowers) by [[Pedro Prado]] in 1908, a work that broke with metric restraints and the rules of poetry. Prado also published "El llamado del mundo" (The call of the world) and "Los pájaros errantes" (The wandering birds) in 1913 and 1915, and founded artistic group "Los Diez" with architect Julio Bertrand.&lt;ref name=MemCh-LosDiez&gt;{{cite Memoria Chilena

On December 22, 1914, [[Gabriela Mistral]] - who would later win the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] - won the "Juegos Florales de [[Santiago]]" poetry contest, her first recognition as a great talent. In 1919, Gabriela Mistral published "[[Desolación]]", the work that won her the [[List of Nobel laureates in Literature|Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1945. "Desolación", "Tala", "Lagar" were some of her most important poetic works.
In 1914, [[Vicente Huidobro]] published "Arte del sugerimiento" (The art of suggestion) and "Non serviam", two works that initiated the [[Creacionismo]] movement which saw a poem as a truly new thing, created by the author for the sake of itself. Huidrobro published the "manifesto" of the movement in his book "El espejo de agua" (The water mirror) in 1916.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; another poet of this generation, took "love" as his main topic and was known for the sadness of his poems. In 1915, he published "Las manos juntas" (Holding hands), his most characteristic work.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1920 and 1922 respectively. In 1938, Pablo de Rokha founded and managed the publishing house "Multitud", which distributed books in the United States, Russia and Latin America.
Also in this period, between 1914 and 1925, [[Juan Guzmán Cruchaga]] published "Junto al brasero" (Beside the brazier), "La mirada inmóvil" (The motionless gaze), "Lejana" (Far), "La fiesta del corazón" (Party of the heart), and the anthology "Agua de cielo" (Water of heaven).&lt;ref name=MemCh-JuanGuzmanCruchaga&gt;{{cite Memoria Chilena

During the 20th century, neo-modernist and avant-garde Chilean poets found fame beyond Chilean borders. [[Gabriela Mistral]] won the first Latin American Nobel Prize of Literature, followed by fellow Chilean [[Pablo Neruda]]. The father of the [[Creacionismo]] [[literary movement|movement]], [[Vicente Huidobro]], also contributed to the internationalization of Chilean literature.

[[File:Pablo Neruda (1966).jpg|thumb|200px|Chilean Nobel Prize winner Pablo Neruda]]

[[Pablo Neruda]] published the works "Crepusculario" and "Veinte poemas de amor y una canción desesperada" in 1923 and 1924, as a prelude to the great success he would have in the next quarter century.

===Imaginismo===
Chilean Imagism was a literary trend that started in 1925 in opposition to [[Criollismo]], which it accused of being nationalist, narrow and lacking imagination. Imaginist writers moved away from the elements used as inspiration by previous generations (everyday life, rural life and the fight against nature).
The Imaginist group, made up of writers [[Ángel Cruchaga Santa María]],&lt;ref name=MemCh-AngelCruchagaSantaMaria /&gt; [[Salvador Reyes Figueroa|Salvador Reyes]], [[Hernán del Solar]], [[Luis Enrique Délano]]&lt;ref name=MemCh-LuisEnriqueDelano&gt;{{cite Memoria Chilena

}}&lt;/ref&gt; broke with the most prominent literary critics of the time. Luis Enrique Délano said in an article about the origin of the Imagism: "We had not decided to innovate at all, but we had a common sense that Chilean literature was full of "Criollismo", cloying and heavy.&lt;ref name=MemCh-Imaginismo&gt;{{cite Memoria Chilena

===La Mandrágora===

{{Main|La Mandrágora}}

''La Mandrágora'' (Spanish for ''The [[Mandrake (disambiguation)|Mandrake]]'') was a [[Chile]]an [[Surrealist]] group founded on 12 July 1938 by [[Braulio Arenas]] (1913–1988), [[Teófilo Cid]], [[Enrique Gómez Correa]] and [[Jorge Cáceres (poet)|Jorge Cáceres]] (who was still a teenager at the time).&lt;ref name=article&gt;[http://www2.udec.cl/~mariasmo/literatura/La%20Mandr%E1gora.htm La Mandrágora] article {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group met in [[Talca]] and by 1932, Braulio Arenas was exchanging ideas with Teófilo Cid and Enrique Gómez.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mandragora.uchile.cl/critica/index.html Interview of Braulio Arenas] by [[Ștefan Baciu]] (Entrevista a Braulio Arenas: "La Mandrágora opera con la virtud de una leyenda", por Stefan Baciu) {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1935, these ideas had become more developed, and in 1938, they held a kind of initiation ceremony reading surrealist poems and texts at the University of Chile. They went on to publish a magazine called, like the group, "La Mandrágora" (seven issues were produced on a small scale, from December 1938 to October 1943&lt;ref name=article/&gt;), as well as anthology of poetry, ''El AGC de la Mandrágora'', (The AGC of the Mandrake) which included works by all founders except Teófilo Cid. Politically, the group supported the [[Popular Front (Chile)|Popular Front]].
Among the main achievements of this group was the publication of "La Mandrágora", which promoted the [[surrealism|surrealist]] movement in Chile; a conference held at the [[University of Chile]] in 1939, a surrealist exhibition held in the [[Biblioteca Nacional de Chile]] (national library of Chile) in 1941, and an international surrealist exposition in Galleria Dédalo in Santiago in 1948. [[Braulio Arenas]] also published the magazine "Leit-motiv" from 1942 to 1943, with contributions from [[André Breton]], [[Benjamin Péret]] and [[Aimé Césaire]], linking "La Mandrágora" with the French surrealists.

The group began to separate in 1949. In 1957, Braulio Arenas, Enrique Gómez Correa and Jorge Cáceres published the anthology "El AGC de la Mandrágora", which included a surrealist dictionary and a bibliography of the Chilean surrealism.

===Neocriollismo===

The first half of the 1940s saw the emergence of the "Generación neocriollista de 1940" (Neo Criollista Generation of 1940).&lt;ref name=MemCh-GeneracionLiteraria1938&gt;{{cite Memoria Chilena

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The neocriollistas&amp;nbsp;— a name that can be translated as "neo traditionalist" - put a great emphasis on local customs and wanted to portray the life of the common people in a social and human way. A key factor that influenced their ideology was the turbulent political times that they lived in, with group members committed to Marxism and left-wing political activism.
One of the most important writers of this generation was [[Nicomedes Guzmán]],&lt;ref name=MemCh-NicomedesGuzman&gt;

Brunet's play "Montaña adentro" (Into the mountain) is notable for its use of rural language and peasant slang to portray life in the country, while Allamand put special emphasis on children's literature and was one of the pioneers of this genre.

===Children's literature===

The first children's literature published in Chile date back to the period when the printing press was introduced in Chile around 1812. These texts were mainly educational and religious books, written mostly by Spanish priests in order to educate children.
It was in the early 20th century when several magazines for children were founded, including "Revista de los Niños" (The Kids' Magazine) in 1905, "Chicos y Grandes" (Kids and Grownups) in 1908, and "El Penaca" - the only one that lasted into the next decades.&lt;ref name=MemCh-Peneca&gt;{{cite Memoria Chilena

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Around the same time, two children's books by [[Agustín Edwards Mac-Clure]] were published: "Aventuras de Juan Esparraguito" (The Adventures of Juan Little Asparagus ) and "El niño casi legumbre" (The Almost Bean Boy).

Another precursor of children's literature in Chile was [[Blanca Santa Cruz Ossa]]&lt;ref name=MemCh-LiteraturaInfantilChilena:BlancaSantaCruzOssa&gt;{{cite Memoria Chilena

[[File:Gabriela Mistral 1945.jpg|thumb|Gabriela Mistral, 1945]]

[[Maité Allamand]], [[Carmen de Alonso]] and [[Marta Brunet]] also wrote children's literature inspired by Chilean folklore. Allamand produced works like "Alamito el largo" (The little long poplar, 1950) while Brunet wrote "Cuentos para Marisol" (Tales for Marisol, 1938) and "Por qué el petirrojo tiene el pecho rojo" (Why robins have a red chest, 1938). Around this time, [[Gabriela Mistral]] composed poetry dedicated to children, primarily in her works "Tala" and "Ternura".

In 1964, a subsidiary of IBBY (International Board on Books for Young People) was set up in Chile, bringing together a group of writers to promote literature for children and young people. Among the writers taking part were [[Marcela Paz]] ("Papelucho"), who was also the first director of the Chilean IBBY, [[Maité Allamand]], [[Chela Reyes]], [[Gabriela Lezaeta]], [[María Silva Ossa]],&lt;ref name=MemCh-MariaSilvaOssa&gt;{{cite Memoria Chilena

==History==
During the 20th century, the study of history and historical literature in Chile saw profound changes, moving away from the tradition of the great 19th century liberal historians. This was due to a combination of factors, including the ideological struggles of the time and the gradual professionalization of historical studies through the creation of institutes and specialized departments in different universities of Chile.&lt;ref name=MemCh-HistoriografiaChilenaSiglo20&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the main trends was the influential conservative school that monopolised historic debate until the 1960s. Leading writers in the school included [[Jaime Eyzaguirre]],&lt;ref name=MemCh-JaimeEyzaguirre&gt;{{cite Memoria Chilena

}}&lt;/ref&gt; with his "Fisonomía histórica de Chile" (Historic physiognomy of Chile), [[Francisco Antonio Encina]] with his "Historia de Chile" (History of Chile), and [[Alberto Edwards]] with "Bosquejo histórico de los partidos políticos chilenos" (Historical sketch of the Chilean political parties, 1903), "La Fronda Aristocrática en Chile" (The Aristocratic Fronde in Chile, 1928) and "La Organización Política de Chile" (The Political Organization of Chile, 1943). These writers produced a harsh critique of 19th-century social liberalism and the changes that had occurred since the 1920s, viewing these changes as a process of decadence. Conservative historians rejected modernity and proposed a substitution of representative democracy for authoritarian regimes to ensure the maintenance of social order and the [[Catholic]] faith.

By the mid-20th century, two new historical trends has emerged that competed with the conservative school. The first, [[Marxist]] trend focused its efforts on the reconstruction and recovery of the history of Chilean working class, with writers including [[Julio César Jobet]]&lt;ref name=MemCh-PrecursoresHistoriaSocialObrera:JulioCesarJobet&gt;{{cite Memoria Chilena

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These authors were criticized for the political-ideological character of their work, though their legacy lived on through the later generation of the 1980s, who developed a new way of describing history focused on Chilean popular movements.

The second trend brought real innovation to the study of history, introducing new techniques and research methodologies borrowed from the new European historiography, particularly the French [[Annales School]]. Historians of this school included [[Mario Góngora]], [[Álvaro Jara]], [[Rolando Mellafe]],&lt;ref name=MemCh-RolandoMellafeRojas&gt;{{cite Memoria Chilena

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sergio Villalobos]] among others. They focused on topics that had been neglected before like economics and demographics. The vast majority of these new researchers studied at the Pedagogical Institute of the [[University of Chile]].
This new historiography movement put emphasis on the study of the long-running processes that had shaped the institutions, society and economy of Chile since colonial times. By the late 1960s, historians of this school had created links with the Marxist movement. The [[1973 Chilean coup d'état]] put an abrupt end to this process and repressed the new social historiography, forcing these historians and researchers to flee the country. Many of them went to European universities to undertake postgraduate studies, which in the long term helped perfect their professional skills.

===After World War II===

As a consequence of the vast changes during [[World War II]], Chilean literature became more universal in its themes, focusing on problems common to the whole humanity and using new modes of expression. In the [[novel]] form, key works included [[Manuel Rojas (author)|Manuel Rojas]]' "Hijo de ladrón" (Son of a thief), [[María Luisa Bombal]]'s "La amortajada" (The shrouded) and [[José Donoso]]'s "El obsceno pájaro de la noche" (The obscene bird of the night). Key poetic works included [[Nicanor Parra]]'s "Poemas y antipoemas" (Poems and antipoems), [[Humberto Díaz Casanueva]]'s "Réquiem", [[Eduardo Anguita]]'s "Venus en el pudridero" (Venus on the garbage heap), [[Gonzalo Rojas]]' "Contra la muerte" (Against death), [[Jorge Teillier]]'s "Muertes y maravillas" (Deaths and wonders), [[Fernando González Urízar]]'s "Los signos del cielo" (Signs from heaven), [[Miguel Arteche]]'s "Fénix de madrugada", (Phoenix at dawn) and [[Raúl Zurita]]'s "Purgatorio" (Purgatory). In drama, important works included [[Luis Alberto Heiremans]]'&lt;ref name=MemCh-LuisAlbertoHeiremans&gt;{{cite Memoria Chilena

===After the 1973 coup===

Following the [[1973 Chilean coup d'état|coup d'état of September 11, 1973]], culture diminished in Chile. The coup forced many writers to emigrate, and after a while Chilean writers began to create publishing houses and magazines in their new homes in exile. Journals published by Chileans in exile included "Araucaria" in Spain, "Literatura chilena en el exilio" (Chilean literature in exile) in California and "América Joven" (Young America) in the Netherlands. The editorials "Ediciones Cordillera" in Canada, "LAR" and "Ediciones Michay" in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://culturacolectiva.com/arte-en-chile-despues-del-golpe-de-estado/ Arte en Chile después del golpe de Estado] http://culturacolectiva.com/ Sonny Pimentel September 11, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
Chilean literature underwent a process of internationalization at this time, despite the fact that Chileans still living in Chile had lost their writers, along with most other forms of art. The mix of [[Magic realism]] and "family saga", for example, brought international fame to [[Antonio Skarmeta]], [[Fernando Alegría]], [[Gonzalo Rojas]], [[Humberto Díaz Casanueva]], [[Ariel Dorfman]] and [[Isabel Allende]], [[Hernán Neira]]. In times of dictatorship and repression, Chilean literature contributed to raising international awareness about the situation in Chile. Virtually every major city in the western world was home to Chilean writers, many of whom denounced the regime of [[Augusto Pinochet]],.&lt;ref name=MemCh-LiteraturaChilenaExilio&gt;{{cite Memoria Chilena

Possibly due to the diaspora of exile, Chilean literature during and after the dictatorship was not uniform in style. Young writers found themselves transplanted in a foreign culture, and it would take time for writers returning from exile to get used to the Chilean intellectual environment and form new groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.escritores.cl/base.php?f1=articulos/texto/30_anos_de_literatura_chilena.htm 30 años de literatura chilena (una mirada parcial desde el norte)] http://www.escritores.cl Jorge Etcheverry September 16, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  In poetry, there was the so-called "Nueva poesia chilena" (New Chilean poetry).

For example, while Gabriela Mistral was head teacher at the Girls' High School in [[Temuco]], Chile, and already recognized as an outstanding poet, a teenage boy came to her with his own poems, asking for her opinion. This teenager was Neftalí Reyes, who would later take the pseudonym of Pablo Neruda and become another great Chilean poet. He would also follow in Mistral's footsteps when he won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1971,&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1971/ The Nobel Prize in Literature 1971] April 4, 2011 Nobelprize.org retrieved October 8, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; 26 years after Mistral herself had won the highest honor in literature in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1945/ The Nobel Prize in Literature 1945] April 4, 2011 Nobelprize.org retrieved October 8, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to this tenuous link, the relationship between Huidobro, De Rokha and Neruda was one of the most persistent rivalries in Chilean cultural history. They were peers, part of the same generation, and were all at some point in their lives members of the [[Partido Comunista de Chile|Chilean Communist Party]]. De Rokha would later be expelled from the party for some disagreement with the leaders, as they claim today.

Mistral expressed no political affiliation in Chile, although according to the Chilean writer [[Jaime Quezada]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laprensa.com.ni/2012/12/03/cultura/125982-amiga-dario-sandino La amiga de Darío y Sandino] laprensa.com.ni December 3, 2012 retrieved October 02, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; an expert on the work of Mistral, she expressed her Pan-Americanist will in her work "Tala", and expressed solidarity with the [[Nicaragua]]n revolutionary [[Augusto Sandino]] in two texts published in 1928.

The other three poets' links with the Communist party was a reflection of the political climate at the time and their desire to fight for the social change in Chile. However, personal disputes played a more important role than politics in their relationship. Pablo de Rokha became one of Neruda's bitterest enemies, considering him bourgeois and a hypocritical opportunist in political and social life. De Rokha wrote several essays and pamphlets in which he railed against Neruda, for example the poem "[[Tercet]]os Dantescos":

{{col-begin|class=toc|bgColor=#EFEFEF|width=100%}}
{{col-2}}

:Gallipavo senil y cogotero
:de una poesía sucia, de macacos,
:tienes la panza hinchada de dinero.

{{col-2}}

: Senile hypocrite and robber
: of dirty monkey poetry,

{{col-end}}

[[Vicente Huidobro|Huidobro]] joined the communist party earlier than [[Pablo Neruda|Neruda]], and was extremely politically active for much of his life. Towards the end of his life, however, he left the political sphere and retired to his house in [[Cartagena, Chile|Cartagena]] on the coast of Chile. [[Vicente Huidobro|Huidobro]] also accused Neruda of plagiarising [[Rabindranath Tagore]] and in November 1934, the second edition of "PRO" magazine published without comment two poems discovered by Huidobro's friend [[Volodia Teitelboim]]: [[Rabindranath Tagore|Tagore's]] "Poem 30" from "The Gardener" and Neruda's very similar "Poem 16" from "20 Poems of Love".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neruda.uchile.cl/critica/decosta.html El Neruda de Huidobro] René De Costa Universidad de Chile retrieved October 15, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Huidobro is also known to have referred to Neruda as a "Romantic Poet" who wrote poems for 15-year-old girls.

Neruda reacted his peers' criticism by writing a text called "Aquí estoy" (Here I am), published in [[Paris]] in 1938, where he denounced their animosity and vilification. Despite this criticism, Neruda is recognized as one of the twenty six authors that make up the [[The Western Canon: The Books and School of the Ages|Western canon]] of literature, along with Shakespeare, Dante, Chaucer, Cervantes, Michel de Montaigne, Molière, Milton, Samuel Johnson, Goethe, Wordsworth, Jane Austen, Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson, Charles Dickens, George Eliot, Tolstoy, Ibsen, Freud, Proust, James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, Franz Kafka, Borges, Neruda, Fernando Pessoa, Samuel Beckett.

Neruda could put an end to the conflict once de Rokha and Huidobro were dead, instead in his speech at the Nobel Prize ceremony he says referring to Huidobro: "El poeta no es un pequeño Dios" (The poet, is not a little god).

[[File:La Barque de Dante (Delacroix 3820).jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Vergil]] leading [[Dante]] on his journey in the ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', an image that dramatizes the continuity of the classical tradition&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Grafton, Glenn W. Most, and Salvatore Settis, preface to ''The Classical Tradition'' (Harvard University Press, 2010), pp. viii–ix.&lt;/ref&gt; (''Dante and Vergil in Hell'' by [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]], 1823)]]
The [[Western culture|Western]] '''classical tradition''' is the [[reception theory|reception]] of [[classical antiquity|classical Greco-Roman antiquity]] by later cultures, especially the post-classical West,&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Grafton]], [[Glenn W. Most]], and Salvatore Settis, preface to ''The Classical Tradition'' (Harvard University Press, 2010), pp. vii–viii.&lt;/ref&gt; involving texts, imagery, objects, ideas, institutions, monuments, architecture, cultural artifacts, rituals, practices, and sayings.&lt;ref&gt;Grafton, Most, and Settis, preface to ''The Classical Tradition'', p. viii.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Philosophy]], [[History of political thinking|political thought]], and [[classical mythology|mythology]] are three major examples of how classical culture survives and continues to have influence.&lt;ref&gt;Grafton, Most, and Settis, entry on "mythology," in ''The Classical Tradition'', p. 614 ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; The West is one of a number of world cultures regarded as having a classical tradition, including the [[Classical India|Indian]], [[Chinese classics|Chinese]], [[Judaism|Judaic]], and [[Islamic Golden Age|Islamic]] traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Grafton, Most, and Settis, preface to ''The Classical Tradition'', p. x.&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of the classical tradition differs from [[classical philology]], which seeks to recover "the meanings that ancient texts had in their original contexts."&lt;ref&gt;Craig W. Kallendorf, introduction to ''A Companion to the Classical Tradition'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; It examines both later efforts to uncover the realities of the [[Greco-Roman world]] and "creative misunderstandings" that reinterpret ancient values, ideas and aesthetic models for contemporary use.&lt;ref&gt;Grafton, Most, and Settis, preface to ''The Classical Tradition'', p. vii; Kallendorf, introduction to ''Companion'', p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The classicist and translator [[Charles Martindale]] has defined the reception of classical antiquity as "a two-way process … in which the present and the past are in dialogue with each other."&lt;ref&gt;Charles Martindale, "Reception," in ''A Companion to the Classical Tradition'' (2007), p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The beginning of a self-conscious classical tradition is usually located in the [[Renaissance]], with the work of [[Petrarch]] in [[Italian Renaissance|14th-century Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;Kallendorf, introduction to ''Companion'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Petrarch believed that he was recovering an unobstructed view of a classical past that had been obscured for centuries, the classical tradition in fact had continued uninterrupted during the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;Kallendorf, introduction to ''Companion'', p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; There was no single moment of rupture when the inhabitants of what was formerly the [[Roman Empire]] went to bed in antiquity and awoke in the medieval world; rather, the cultural transformation occurred over centuries. The use and meaning of the classical tradition may seem, however, to change dramatically with the emergence of [[Renaissance humanism|humanism]].&lt;ref&gt;Kallendorf, introduction to ''Companion'', pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aeneas' Flight from Troy by Federico Barocci.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|left|[[Aeneas]] carrying his father and leading his son from fallen [[Troy]], a popular image in the Renaissance for the retrieval of the past as a way to make possible the future; the figure of his wife, [[Creusa]], who did not survive, represents that which was lost&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gillgren, ''Siting Federico Barocci and the Renaissance Aesthetic'' (Ashgate, 2011), pp. 165–167.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Federico Barocci]], 1598)]]
The phrase "classical tradition" is itself a modern label, articulated most notably in the [[Post-war#Year spans of the post-World War II era|post-World War II era]] with ''The Classical Tradition: Greek and Roman Influences on Western Literature'' of [[Gilbert Highet]] (1949) and ''The Classical Heritage and Its Beneficiaries'' of [[R. R. Bolgar]] (1954). The English word "tradition," and with it the concept of "handing down" classical culture, derives from the Latin verb ''trado, tradere, traditus'', in the sense of "hand over, hand down."&lt;ref&gt;Kallendorf, introduction to ''Companion'', p. 1.&lt;!--note--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Writers and artists influenced by the classical tradition may name their ancient models, or [[allusion|allude]] to their works. Often scholars infer classical influence through [[Comparative literature|comparative methods]] that reveal patterns of thought. Sometimes authors' copies of Greek and Latin texts will contain handwritten annotations that offer direct evidence of how they read and understood their classical models; for instance, in the late 20th century the discovery of [[Montaigne]]'s copy of [[Lucretius]] enabled scholars to document an influence that had long been recognized.&lt;ref&gt;Kallendorf, introduction to ''Companion'', p. 2.&lt;!--here--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Courtenay Place''' is the main street of the Courtenay Quarter in the [[Wellington]], New Zealand inner-city district of [[Te Aro]].

Courtenay Place is known for its entertainment and nightlife. Many restaurants are open late and most of the bars stay open until dawn. It contains offices, accommodation, tourist shopping, entertainment, food, art and buskers offering many genres of free performance. Pedestrian traffic is substantial around the clock.

== Early development ==
[[File:Courtenay Place, circa 1900 (4839950942).jpg|alt=A black and white photo of the view east down Courtenay Place, around 1900|left|thumb|The view east down Courtenay Place, around 1900]]
The first building of any importance in Courtenay Place was built shortly after 1900 by local butcher and businessman, [[John William Rod (New Zealand)|John Rod]] JP.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary, ''Evening Post'',13 Jan 1920.&lt;/ref&gt; It is now a heritage listed building, originally designed by T S Lambert, situated on the eastern corner of Allen Street and Courtenay Place. Of brick construction, it originally had three stories and a large cellar, with stables at the rear (now 23 Allen street).&lt;ref&gt;Original Plans held by Wellington City Archives&lt;/ref&gt; It has since been reduced to two stories, probably due to earthquake damage. In 2015, the ground floor and cellars accommodate a bar and restaurant.

==The arts==

Every two years Courtenay Place is home to many of the [[New Zealand International Arts Festival]] events.

'''[[Bats Theatre]]''' is a venue for the development of new theatre practitioners and plays.

'''[[Downstage Theatre]]''', founded in 1964, is New Zealand's first professional theatre.

'''[[Embassy Theatre (Wellington)|Embassy Theatre]]''' ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' movie ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|The Return of the King]]'' had its world premiere at the Embassy Theatre at the head of Courtenay Place. The movies ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers|The Two Towers]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' both had their [[Australasia]]n premiere at the Embassy (Event Slide Shows). Both events were broadcast live to the world for many hours, involving the movement of record amounts of data by [[CityLink Limited|CityLink]]. The theatre is on the Wellington City Council's heritage list in the District Plan. [[Heritage New Zealand]] has recognised its heritage values with Category One registration, indicating a place of 'special or outstanding historical or cultural heritage significance or value'. It was originally known as the 'De Luxe' and was built in 1924. Designed by Llewellyn Williams and constructed of reinforced concrete, it included classical external and internal architectural details. The name changed to the Embassy in 1945. A long list of theatre identities has been associated with the theatre, including [[William Kemball]], who formed the [[De Luxe Theatre Company]] in 1923, and [[Sir Robert Kerridge]]. [[Kerry Robins]], leaseholder of the Paramount Theatre in Wellington, took over the lease of the Embassy in 1996. It was purchased by the [[Embassy Theatre Trust]] in 1997 with financial underwriting of the refurbishment programme by Wellington City Council. Ownership was transferred to the WCC under the terms of the agreement. Embassy Theatre Trust subsidiary Company Financial report: Audit report In October 2005 Wellington film exhibitor Kerry Robins sold the operational management of the Embassy to Village SkyCity Cinemas.

'''Paramount Theatre''' (no longer operational) is the oldest surviving cinema in Wellington, still with its original name. Originally a part of Te Aro beach, in August 1916 the location of the Paramount was purchased by [[John James Williamson]]. He arranged for architect [[James Bennie]] to design a picture house.

'''Reading Courtenay Central Complex''' contains shops, restaurants and a ten-screen multiplex cinema. The 8,000 m² development links Courtenay Place with the waterfront and was designed to complement the existing character of the strip. This project won the 2003 Property Council NZ Entertainment Excellence Award.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ignite-direct.com {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060402210211/http://ignite-direct.com/ |date=2 April 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The site was originally bulldozed in the mid-1980s by [[Chase Corporation]] for the proposed Wakefield Centre,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vertical Living: The Architectural Centre and the Remaking of Wellington|author=Julia Gatley, Kunal Hari, Damian Skinner, Justine Clark|page=|year=2014|publisher=Auckland University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; but after the company fell victim to the [[Black Monday (1987)|1987 sharemarket crash]], the site remained derelict for years until it was purchased by Reading Cinemas. The complex was temporarily shut down for safety reasons, after a large earthquake in late 2016 damaged an adjacent parking building beyond repair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/nz-earthquake/88029844/big-bertha-crane-moves-in-for-reading-cinema-car-park-demolition|title='Big Bertha' crane moves in for Reading Cinema car park demolition|date=2016-12-30|publisher=Stuff.co.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision]]''' (aka NZ Film Archive) is on the corner of Ghuznee St and Taranaki St, a block from Courtenay Place.

'''[[Opera House (Wellington)|The Opera House]]'''

'''[[St James Theatre (Wellington)|St James Theatre]]'''. Formerly His Majesty's (and more recently the Westpac St James Theatre), the St. James was designed for [[John Fuller and Sons Ltd]] by Mr [[Henry Eli White]] Architect, structural engineer and contractor. It was the first steel-framed concrete-coated proscenium-arched theatre in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. The steel frame allowed for an unsupported 80&amp;nbsp;ft (25 m) span roof structure and also provided good resistance to earthquake damage.

In July 2011, Positively Wellington Venues, an integration between the Wellington Convention Centre and the St James Theatre Trust, began managing this theatre as well as The Opera House, Wellington.

There are two other theatres that sit just outside the Courtenay Place district, '''Circa Theatre''' which sits on the waterfront near Te Papa; and '''Capital E''', home of the National Theatre for Children, which is in Civic Square.

==Events==
In 2017, [[TEDxWellington]] hosted 13 speakers and 1,000 delegates at the [[St. James Theatre, Wellington|St. James Theatre]] on Courtenay Place.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/92717745/Hasbro-toy-designer-among-list-of-TEDxWellington-speakers&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Elkader Opera House''' is a historic building located in [[Elkader, Iowa]], United States.  The building was individually listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1976.&lt;ref name=nris/&gt;  In 2012 it was included as a [[contributing property]] in the [[Elkader Downtown Historic District]].&lt;ref name=Elkader2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elkader-iowa.com/Elkader-Downtown-Historic-District.html|title=Elkader Downtown Historic District|publisher=Elkader, Iowa|accessdate=2016-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Opera House opened on November 27, 1903 replacing a previous opera house on the same location that was destroyed by fire the previous year.  The first show performed on its stage was [[George M. Cohan]]'s "The Governor's Son," which was performed by the Cohan Brothers.&lt;ref name=Opera&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elkaderoperahouse.com/lab/about-us/history/|title=History|publisher=Elkader Opera House|accessdate=2016-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Opera House was on the [[Chicago]]-[[Minneapolis]] circuit when it first opened.  [[Ed Wynn]] was on at least one [[Programme (booklet)|playbill]] in those years.&lt;ref name=Costigan&gt;{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=76000748}}|title=Elkader Opera House|publisher=[[National Park Service]]|accessdate=2016-09-02|author=Marjorie C. Costigan}} with {{NRHP url|id=76000748|photos=y|title=photos}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The other functions the building has hosted have included a community room, dance hall, roller rink, library, fire station, economic development office, city hall, and the Abd el-Kader Sister City Museum.&lt;ref name=Elkader1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elkader-iowa.com/Opera-House7.html|title=Elkader Opera House|publisher=Elkader, Iowa|accessdate=2016-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first floor main [[facade]] was significantly altered for it to be used as a firehouse in 1949.  Two double doors were placed in the center and right [[Bay (architecture)|bays]] for the firetrucks.   A restoration project was begun in 1963 to return the auditorium to its original condition. It was extensively renovation in 2004.  The opera house is now the home of the Keystone Barbershop Chorus and the Opera House Players.  It also still houses Elkader's City Hall.

==Architecture== 
The three-story brick building features a symmetrical facade.&lt;ref name=Costigan/&gt;  The center bay has three round arch windows that are flanked above and below with ornamental brickwork.  There is also brickwork near the [[cornice]] level of the side bays.  The three bays are separated by brick [[pilaster]]s.  An entrance on the side of the building was created for city hall.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3551">'''Experimental tourism''' is a novel approach to [[tourism]] in which visitors do not visit the ordinary [[tourist attraction]]s (or, at least not with the ordinary approach), but allow whim to guide them. It is an alternative form of tourism in which destinations are chosen not on their standard touristic merit but on the basis of an idea or experiment. It often involves elements of [[humor]], [[serendipity]], and [[Randomness|chance]].

There are a number of approaches to experimental tourism:
*[[Aerotourism]] – in which a tourist visits the local airport and explores it without going anywhere.
*[[Alphatourism]] – in which a tourist finds the first street alphabetically on a map, and the last street alphabetically, draws a straight line (or any other figure they desire) between them, and walk the path between the two points.
*[[Alternating Travel]] – in which a tourist leaves their front door, turns right, turns left at the next intersection, turns right at the next, and so on, alternating each direction, until they are unable to continue because of an obstruction.
*[[Blindfolded tourism]] or Cecitourism – in which a blindfolded tourist is escorted through the city by a guide.
*[[Contretourism]] – in which a tourist visits a famous tourist site, but turns their back on the site and takes photos of, or just examines, the view from that direction.
*[[Erotourism]] – in which a couple travels separately to the same city and then tries to find each other.
*[[Monopolytourism]] – in which a tourist takes the local version of a [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]] board with them and visits places on the board as determined by a roll of the [[dice]].
*[[Nyctalotourism]] – in which the tourist only visits tourist attractions between dusk and dawn.
*[[Sagittatourism]] – in which a [[person]] [[throws]] an [[arrow]] (often a [[dart arrow]]) on a [[map]], and [[travel]]s to the [[Location (geography)|place]] the arrow hit on the map.

Other ideas do not have particular names:

*"Touring" a home town.  Stay at a [[youth hostel]], [[Backpacking (travel)|backpack]] through town, meet new people, do not go home until the vacation is over.
*Taking a map of the town being visited, selecting a random map grid, and exploring every bit of the grid.
*Visiting a [[Bar (establishment)|bar]], asking the [[bartender]] where their favorite bar is and what they drink there.  Visit that bar, do the same with the bartender there, and continue.

The concept of experimental travel was developed by writer Joel Henry, the [[France|French]] director of the Laboratory of Experimental Tourism (Latourex).

In 2005, [[Lonely Planet]] published ''The Lonely Planet Guide to Experimental Travel'', which formalised and developed many of Henry's ideas.

'''''Gray Matters''''' is a 2006 American [[romantic comedy]] film directed by [[Sue Kramer]] and starring [[Heather Graham (actress)|Heather Graham]], [[Tom Cavanagh]], and [[Bridget Moynahan]]. It premiered on October 21, 2006 at the [[Hamptons International Film Festival]] and had a United States limited theatrical release on February 23, 2007.

==Plot==
Gray Baldwin ([[Heather Graham]]), a family oriented and quiet [[bachelorette]], lives a close-knit life with her brother, Sam ([[Tom Cavanagh]]). Their lifestyle is generally co-dependent, involving them living together, going to dance classes together, etc. Gray and Sam's relationship has never been thought of as strange, but once a dinner party guest mistakes the siblings as a couple, Gray and Sam decide to venture outside of one another. While discussing with each other what they can do about their single lifestyles, and how they can "hook each other up" with a significant other, their conversation continues to the park, where Gray spots a possible girlfriend for Sam, Charlie Kelsey ([[Bridget Moynahan]]). Gray introduces herself, then Charlie to Sam, and they instantly bond, agreeing to see each other again.

To Gray's surprise, Charlie and Sam become engaged the morning after their meeting. Charlie and Sam are so madly in love with one another, they plan to go to Las Vegas the following morning and elope there, and invite Gray along. Gray is a little hesitant, but agrees when Charlie says they can have a "mini bachelorette party". Gray agrees and the three make their way to Vegas. While in Vegas, Gray takes Charlie out for a [[hen night]], and after many drinks, the two share a drunken but passionate kiss. The next morning, Charlie doesn't remember anything, but Gray hasn't slept the whole night, due to the bond she felt with Charlie. The situation makes Gray finally realize that not only is she attracted to women, but is falling in love with her sister-in-law.

The events in Vegas force a journey of self-discovery, testing the relationship between two very close siblings, and to finding happiness in lonely Manhattan. When Gray eventually 'comes out' to Sam, he tells her he's known all along, since they were young kids.

Later, Sam accidentally discloses Gray's orientation to her entire office, which, along with Sam's encouragement, gives her impetus to move on to further [[Self-actualization|self-actualizing]].

'''Grillo-Theater ''' is a theatre in [[Essen]], Germany. Named after the industrialist [[Friedrich Grillo]], who made the building possible, it opened on 16 September 1892 with [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]]'s drama ''[[Minna von Barnhelm]]''.

The building was badly damaged in World War II; it was restored with a much simpler façade and re-opened in 1950 with Wagner's opera ''[[Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg]]''. Notable directors included [[Erwin Piscator]], [[Jean-Louis Barrault]], [[:de:Heinz Dietrich Kenter|Heinz Dietrich Kenter]], [[:de:Hansgünter Heyme|Hansgünter Heyme]]. [[Caspar Neher]] became head of design in 1927 and designed here eight operas and 11 plays.

In 1988, the role of the Grillo-Theater as Essen's major stage venue was taken by the newly constructed [[Aalto Theatre]] which also opened with ''Die Meistersinger''. Following a major reconstruction by the architect [[:de:Werner Ruhau|Werner Ruhau]] and a reduction of the auditorium from 670 to 400 seats, the Grillo-Theater became a flexible smaller venue; it re-opened in September 1990 with Shakespeare's ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''.

'''Hermann Struck ''' (6 March 1876 – 11 January 1944) was a [[German Jewish]] artist known for his etchings.&lt;ref name="lbi"&gt;[http://www.lbi.org/exhibitions.html Exhibitions]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
[[File:Land Israel by Hermann Struck (5058192938).jpg|thumb|Jaffa]]
 
Hermann Struck (Chaim Aaron ben David) was born in [[Berlin]]. He studied at the Berlin Academy of Fine Arts. In 1904, he joined the [[modern art]] movement known as the [[Berlin Secession]].&lt;ref name="lbi"/&gt;
In 1900, Struck met [[Jozef Israëls]], a Dutch artist, who became his mentor. Both were recognized as leading artists of their time.&lt;ref name="hat"&gt; "Here and There" Smadar Sheffi, ''Haaretz Guide'', March 7, 2008, review of Herman Struck retrospective: Master Print Maker,Open Museum, Tefen Industrial Park, Israel&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1908, Struck published "Die Kunst des Radierens" ("The Art of Etching"), which became a seminal work on the subject.&lt;ref name="hat"/&gt;It was a textbook that offered both theory and practical instruction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mushecht.haifa.ac.il/art/Artist-Collection-eng.aspx?id=40 Hecht Museum: Hermann Struck]&lt;/ref&gt;Struck's students included [[Marc Chagall]], [[Lovis Corinth]], [[Jacob Steinhardt]], [[Lesser Ury]] and [[Max Liebermann]].&lt;ref name="hat"/&gt;
[[File:Hermann Struck Grafik JMBerlin GDR 87 2 0.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[Theodore Herzl]]]]

In 1899, upon completing his studies at the Berlin Academy, he was banned from teaching there because he was Jewish. He signed his work with his Hebrew name, Chaim Aaron ben David, and a [[Star of David]].&lt;ref name="hat"/&gt;{{dubious|The Jaffa etching shown here is signed "Struck" and bears a red emblem (stamp?) "HS". Maybe there is also "Chaim Aaron ben David" written smaller somewhere. Anyway, NOT an accurate statement. Also, the Herzl portrait is signed "Hermann Struck fecit" on the margin, and there is a ''shin'' and a Star of David inside the picture.|date=January 2017}} Struck did commissioned portraits of [[Ibsen]], [[Nietzsche]], [[Freud]], [[Albert Einstein]], [[Theodor Herzl|Herzl]], [[Oscar Wilde]] and other leading figures of the time.&lt;ref name="hat"/&gt;

Struck was a fervent [[Zionist]] and Jewish activist. He visited the [[Land of Israel]] in 1903, displayed his art at the Fifth [[Zionist Congress]], and was a founder of the [[Mizrachi (Religious Zionism)|Mizrachi Religious Zionist movement]]. At the same time, he was a German patriot and volunteered for military service in World War I&lt;ref name="hat"/&gt; serving as a translator, liaison officer and military artist.&lt;ref name="hat"/&gt; He was awarded the [[Iron Cross]] 1st Class and promoted to an officer for bravery, in 1917 he became the referent for Jewish affairs at the [[Ober Ost|German Eastern Front High Command]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LwRouKYzapsC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;dq=wilhelm+von+gayl&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=gayl&amp;f=false|title=The art and artists of the fifth Zionist Congress, 1901: heralds of a new age|accessdate=2009-08-25 |work= |publisher= Gilya Gerda Schmidt |year=2003 |date= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Struck immigrated to Palestine in 1922, taught at [[Bezalel Academy]] and helped establish the [[Tel Aviv Museum of Art]].&lt;ref name="hat"/&gt; He visited Berlin every summer until the Nazis rose to power.&lt;ref name="hat"/&gt;

'''Keith Salmon''' (born 1959) is a British fine artist. His work is principally semi-abstract Scottish landscapes which are created based upon his experience as a hill walker. Even though he is registered blind Salmon has climbed more than one hundred of Scotland's [[Munro]]s, many of which have been captured in his artworks.

==Education and experience==
Keith Salmon was born in [[Essex]] and moved to [[Wales]] in the late 1960s. He studied for his BA in art at what is now [[Shrewsbury College of Arts &amp; Technology]] and [[Falmouth School of Art]] between 1979 and 1983. He originally trained and worked as a sculptor, constructing pieces from steel, wood and cement fondu. On completion of his studies he moved to [[Newcastle-upon-Tyne]] in the north east of England where he set up his first studio.

In 1989, Salmon moved back to Wales and set up a new studio. Around this time his sight deteriorated very quickly and within a few years he had to stop exhibiting work. He then decided to make the most of the time he still had sight and put his efforts into drawing and painting, finding new methods using just the very limited sight he now had left.

In 1998, he moved to [[Irvine, Ayrshire]], in Scotland and, though registered blind, had enough confidence in the new paintings and drawings he created to once again start exhibiting them.

During this time his work has developed in two different styles: organised scribbles that form his drawings, and the bolder, broad marks in oil or acrylic paintings. Most of his works are based on his experiences while out walking in the Scottish Highlands. Over the last few years he has combined the scribbled pastel line with the painted acrylic marks, stating that he is "trying to capture a little of how I experience these wonderful wild places".&lt;ref&gt;[http://l-a-i.com/uk.html Depicting the Scottish landscape in art]&lt;/ref&gt;

At present Salmon keeps a studio space at [[Courtyard Studios]] in Irvine&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courtyard-studios.co.uk/#/keith-salmon/4531014504 Courtyard Studios]&lt;/ref&gt; and is regularly exhibiting his work again.

==Awards==
In 2009, Salmon won the [[Jolomo Award]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jolomofoundation.org/News.html Jolomo Award]&lt;/ref&gt; for Scottish landscape painting&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.KeithSalmon.org Scottish Landscape Painting award]&lt;/ref&gt; and was interviewed by ''[[The Scotsman]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotsman.com/arts/Interview-Keith-Salmon--visions.5362677.jp Salmon interview]&lt;/ref&gt; one of Scotland's top broadsheet newspapers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7475">There is a '''[[legend]] of the Leather Bridge''' ({{lang-de|Sage von der Ledernen Brücke}}) in several regions of Germany and Switzerland. The word ''lederne'' could also have meant "ladder" or "lantern".

== Palatinate ==
[[File:BurgErfenstein.jpg|thumb|upright|Erfenstein Castle from the south]]
[[File:Burgspangenbergrp.jpg|thumb|Spangenberg Castle from the north]]
According to legend, there was once a leather bridge crossing the [[Elmstein valley]] between the [[Palatinate (region)|Palatine]] castle of [[Erfenstein Castle|Erfenstein]], high above the left bank of the [[Speyerbach]] river, and a second castle, [[Spangenberg Castle (Rhineland-Palatinate)|Spangenberg]], on the opposite side of the valley. Two brothers, or at least two close friends, who visited each other frequently, decided to build the bridge in order to avoid having to take the difficult path through the valley between the two castles and over the then wild River Speyerbach.

Their friendship continued for many years. But one day the two lords, having feasted together at the Spangenberg again, began a heated argument. No doubt, an excess of wine had contributed to the situation. One word led to another and finally the Erfenstein lord, beside himself with rage, returned over the bridge, having shouted loudly, "I will never come back!" Equally furious, the lord of Spangenberg roared after him, "You don't need to; I'll see to that!" And when the lord of Erfenstein reached the middle of the bridge, Spangenberg cut the leather straps with his sword. The bridge fell into the depths and the lord of Erfenstein plunged to his death. One source records that the dispute was because one lord, who was a bachelor and the golden-haired wife of his brother had fallen in love and the bridge was used for their trysts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TNoCEYmIziUC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=Story+of+the+%22Leather+Bridge%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nasHU-mPDcGM7AbhvIGIDQ&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Story%20of%20the%20%22Leather%20Bridge%22&amp;f=false ''Up the Wooden Hill: The Tale of Two Families''] by Jill Schaefer. Retrieved 21 Feb 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TvZiC5ZEqQQC&amp;pg=PA82&amp;dq=%22Sage+von+der+Ledernen+Br%C3%BCcke%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3bYHU9a0LOTW7QaWhYHwCA&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Sage%20von%20der%20Ledernen%20Br%C3%BCcke%22&amp;f=false ''Pfälzerwald und Deutsche Weinstraße: Wandern &amp; Einkehren. 50 Touren. Mit GPS ...''] by Jörg-Thomas Titz. Retrieved 21 Feb 2014.   &lt;/ref&gt;

Ever after this murder there was bitter enmity between the owners of the two castles and they damaged one another whenever they could.

The historic background to the legend is that the two castles were always owned by different overlords – initially Spangenberg to the [[Bishopric of Speyer|Speyer prince-bishop]] and Erfenstein to the [[counts of Leiningen]] – who in were always in competition with one another. When, later, their ownership changed, a conflict broke out, the Weißenburg Feud, between Elector [[Frederick I of the Palatinate|Frederick&amp;nbsp;I]] of the [[Electoral Palatinate|Palatinate]] and his cousin, Duke [[Louis I of Palatinate-Zweibrücken|Louis&amp;nbsp;I]] of [[Palatinate-Zweibrücken]]. As a result both castles were destroyed in 1470; first, Erfenstein, and then, Spangenberg. 

Technically, to make a bridge made of soft, sagging material such as leather would not have been practicable because the height of the castles above the floor of the valley (about one hundred metres) would not be enough to span the five hundred metres between them.

== Eifel ==
A leather bridge is supposed to have linked the two castles of [[Stolzenburg (Eifel)|Stolzenburg]] and Pielstein over the [[Urft (river)|Urft]]. According to local legend, their knights lived in the lap of luxury, demanding [[socage]] from the farmers, yet allowing their children to play skittles along the bridge with loaves of bread, whilst the subjects were dying of hunger. God himself is said to have destroyed both castles by unleashing a natural disaster.

== Sauerland ==
Near [[Arnsberg]] legend has it that the devil made a leather bridge between the castles of [[Rüdenburg]] and [[Arnsberg Castle|Arnsberg]] in order to provide an escape route for the beleaguered lord of Rüdenburg and his men. This was done in gratitude for the hospitality that the Rüdenburgers had previously unwittingly shown the devil.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=h3tBAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22Sage+von+der+Ledernen+Br%C3%BCcke%22&amp;dq=%22Sage+von+der+Ledernen+Br%C3%BCcke%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3bYHU9a0LOTW7QaWhYHwCA&amp;ved=0CG0Q6AEwCA ''Geschichte Arnsbergs...: Mit einer alten Ansicht von Stadt und Schloss Arnsberg nebst Abtei Wedinghausen''] by Karl Feaux de Lacroix (1895). Retrieved 21 Feb 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Nördlinger Ries ==
In the valley of [[Kartäusertal]], on the southern edge of the [[Nördlinger Ries]] there was supposed to have been a leather bridge between the three sister castles of Rauhaus, [[Hochhaus Castle|Hochhaus]] and [[Niederhaus Castle|Niederhaus]]. According to legend, whoever "cut the leather bridge" would have his castle swallowed up by the earth.

It is assumed that the ''lederne Brücke'' in this story, actually means a "bridge of lights", in other words that there was a communication link between the castles that was maintained using light signals. When, one day, Rauhaus Castle became unoccupied, the light bridge was interrupted. The castle was then plundered by the local populace and [[slighted]]; it was thus practically "swallowed by the earth".

== Thuringia ==
In [[Mellingen (Thuringia)|Mellingen]] on the River [[Ilm (Saale)|Ilm]] southeast of  [[Weimar]] there were once two castles: one on the Kapellenberg hill and the  Heinrichsburg, both of which were probably destroyed during the [[Saxon Fratricidal War]]. Both castles, separated by about 1.5 kilometres, were supposed to have been connected by a leather bridge. Especially in the older literature (around 1900) it is posited that this legend is a mythological reference to [[Edda]].

== Vogtland ==
Near [[Elsterberg]] on the [[White Elster]] are the ruins of [[Elsterberg Castle]]. A leather bridge is supposed to have joined the old castle over a distance of several hundred metres to the newer buildings.

== Lower Lusatia ==
An evil [[Wends|Wendish]] prince, or according to other [[Sorbs|Sorbian]] legends a Wendish king called ''Prebislav'' in the 10th century, is supposed to have lived in a castle in the ''Teufelslauch'' northeast of [[Friedland (Lower Lusatia)|Friedland]] in the direction of the village of ''Reudnitz''. In order to pursue his crimes as a  [[robber knight]], he left the castle over a leather bridge that he rolled out in front of him and rolled up behind him. When he robbed a man who was in league with the devil, the devil whipped up a mighty [[thunderstorm]]. A lightning bolt killed the prince and the floods caused the castle to sink into the ground. All that remains are the water-filled depressions of the ''Teufelslauch'' ("Devil's Hole").

== Switzerland ==
In [[Wileroltigen]] a tale is told of tunnels, a leather bridge and a stone grave. The castle of [[Oltigen Castle|Oltigen]] and the castle of Wileroltigen were first mentioned in 1006. Along with Hugo of Mümpelgard (Montbéliard), Count of Oltigen they came to an evil end in May 1410, according to [[Conrad Justinger]].

The '''''Livre des Esperitz''''' (or ''Book of Spirits'') is a 15th or 16th century French [[grimoire]] that inspired later works including [[Johann Weyer]]'s ''[[Pseudomonarchia Daemonum]]'' and the ''[[Lesser Key of Solomon]]''.&lt;ref name="Boudet"&gt;"Les who's who démonologiques de la Renaissance et leurs ancêtres médiévaux" by Jean-Patrice Boudet, ''Médiévales'' 44, Spring 2003, [http://medievales.revues.org/1019 (online link)].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Peterson"&gt;[http://www.esotericarchives.com/solomon/weyer.htm Introduction by Joseph Peterson to Johann Weyer's Pseudomonarchia Daemonum], Twilit Grotto -- Esoteric Archives, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kieckhefer-Esperitz"&gt;''Forbidden Rites: A Necromancer's Manual of the Fifteenth Century''; Richard Kieckhefer; Pennsylvania State University Press, University Park, PA; 1997.

Like the ''Lesser Key of Solomon'', the ''Livre des Esperitz'' has been attributed to [[Solomon]].&lt;ref&gt;Boudet, ''Médiévales'', par.27&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Livre des Esperitz'' merely lists the hierarchy of hell, and does not include prayers, conjurations, invocations, or spells to summon any being described.  It does provide detailed descriptions of each spirit's appearance and function, and lists how many legions of demons serve under each.  Many of these descriptions eventually found their way into later works, often unmodified.&lt;ref name="BoudetR" /&gt;

The demons listed within it include:&lt;ref name="Boudet" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kieckhefer-Esperitz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rudd-Goetia-Esperitz" /&gt;

'''Mandana paintings''' are wall and floor paintings of [[Rajasthan]] and [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[India]]. Mandana are drawn to protect home and hearth, welcome gods into the house and as a mark of celebrations on festive occasions. Village women in the Sawai Madhopur area of Rajasthan possess skill for developing designs of perfect symmetry and accuracy. The ground is prepared with [[cow dung]] mixed with rati, a local clay, and red ochre. Lime or [[Chalk|chalk powder]] is used for making the motif. Tools employed are a piece of cotton, a tuft of hair, or a rudimentary brush made out of a date stick. The design may show Ganesha, peacocks, women at work, tigers, floral motifs, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kamboj|first=B. P.|title=Early wall painting of Garhwal|year=2003|publisher=Indus Publ.

'''''Miley: The Movement''''' is a 2013 documentary television film about American entertainer [[Miley Cyrus]], following her return to the music industry in the lead-up to her fourth [[studio album]] ''[[Bangerz]]'' (2013). It premiered on October 2, 2013, on [[MTV]], shortly before the release of her record, for which the documentary served as a promotional tool. The documentary depicts Cyrus finalizing details regarding its launch, making public appearances for additional promotion, and rehearsing for her controversial performance at the [[2013 MTV Video Music Awards]].

''Miley: The Movement'' received generally mixed reviews from mainstream critics, who appreciated Cyrus' seemingly genuine commentary, but were disappointed by its failure to fully discuss her recent controversies and public criticisms. According to [[Nielsen ratings]], it was watched by approximately 1.6 million viewers in the United States. An extended version of the documentary was broadcast by MTV on October 6, 2013.

==Background and production==
It was first announced that Cyrus would appear in a documentary broadcast by [[MTV]] in July 2013; an official statement published by the network elaborated that it would "[follow] Cyrus as she works on the album and delves deep into the transformation she has experienced over the past few years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1711365/miley-cyrus-mtv-documentary-fall-2013/|title=Miley Cyrus Documentary Will Dive Deep On MTV This Fall|author=Gil Kaufman|publisher=[[MTV News]].

''Miley: The Movement'' commences with Cyrus stating "I don't apologize for anything." Shortly after, she comments that "For me, the movement needs to be something bigger than just a record. For me, a movement is something that represents, like, taking over the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/videos/news/961433/mileys-movement-began-in-childhood-took-off-with-we-cant-stop.jhtml#series=2216&amp;seriesId=42399&amp;channelId=1&amp;id=1714960|title=Miley's Movement Began In Childhood, Took Off With 'We Can't Stop'|publisher=MTV.

A brief discussion in a recording studio with [[Britney Spears]], who is featured on the track "[[SMS (Bangerz)]]" is additionally included.&lt;ref name="OK!"/&gt;

Cyrus' former fiancé [[Liam Hemsworth]], whom she had been in a highly publicized relationship with before ending her engagement in September 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/397210/miley-cyrus-and-liam-hemsworth-split-look-back-at-their-road-to-romance|title=Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth Split: Look Back at Their Road to Romance|author=Rebecca Macattee|publisher=E!.

''Miley: The Movement'' received generally mixed reviews from mainstream critics. Writing for [[E!]], Bruna Nessif provided a favorable review; she opined that the documentary was "pretty entertaining" and reminded the general public that Cyrus "takes her job very seriously and still gets nervous."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/466181/miley-cyrus-mtv-special-5-things-we-learned-from-the-movement|title=Miley Cyrus' The Movement: 5 Things We Learned From the MTV Special|author=Bruna Nessif|publisher=[[E!]]. [[NBCUniversal]]|date=October 2, 2013|accessdate=March 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Asare from ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' felt that Cyrus' footage with her mother and Spears were among "her most candid moments", although noted the absences of her father and Hemsworth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2013/10/02/miley-cyrus-the-movement-mtv-react/|title='Miley: The Movement': 5 takeaways from the Miley Cyrus mini-movie|author=Andrew Asare|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=October 2, 2013|accessdate=March 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Newsday]]''{{'}}s Glenn Gamboa gave a positive review, appreciating that Cyrus "surprises with her words, not her [[Twerking|twerks]]."&lt;ref name="Newsday"/&gt; Elysa Gardner of ''[[USA Today]]'' opined that Cyrus appeared "good-humored and grateful to her fans" throughout the documentary, but questioned if her evolving image and public persona would become "yet another cautionary tale."&lt;ref name="USAToday"/&gt;

In a mixed review, Kia Makarechi from ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' was critical of the decision to avoid mentioning Hemsworth and toning-down of the criticism Cyrus received after the MTV Video Music Awards. She implied that MTV treated Cyrus like "an honest-to-god civil rights advocate", although felt that Spears' appearance was among the only "redeeming moments" of the documentary.&lt;ref name="TheHuffingtonPost"/&gt; Kate Dries from [[Jezebel]] suggested that frequent flashback footage of Cyrus' idols [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and Spears implied that MTV was "clearly proud" that all three women generated controversies at the [[MTV Video Music Award]]s in years past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jezebel.com/watch-miley-explain-exactly-what-her-movement-is-1440608399|title=Watch Miley Explain Exactly What Her 'Movement' Is|author=Kate Dries|publisher=Jezebel|date=October 3, 2013|accessdate=March 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for [[Refinery29]], Leila Brillson felt that "very little was clarified" by ''Miley: The Movement'', and suggested that the documentary suffered from a lack of focus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.refinery29.com/2013/10/54687/miley-the-movement|title=Miley Cyrus Has A Movement, But We Don't Know What It Is|author=Leila Brillson|publisher=[[Refinery29]]|date=October 3, 2013|accessdate=March 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its original broadcast in the United States on October 2, 2013, ''Miley: The Movement'' was watched by approximately 1.6 million viewers, and earned a 0.8 rating in the 18–49 demographic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2013/10/03/wednesday-cable-ratings-duck-dynasty-wins-night-bad-ink-south-park-miley-the-movement-the-bridge-more/206611/|title=Wednesday Cable Ratings: 'Duck Dynasty' Wins Night, 'Bad Ink',' South Park', 'Miley: The Movement', 'The Bridge' &amp; More|author=Sara Bibel|publisher=TV by the Numbers.

'''Minhwa''' refers to [[Culture of Korea|Korean]] [[folk art]] produced mostly by itinerant or unknown artists without formal training, emulating contemporary trends in fine art for the purpose of everyday use or decoration.&lt;ref name="Beauty"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Korean Culture and Information Service|title=Korean Beauty|date=2011|publisher=길잡이미디어|isbn=9788973751204|page=272|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rjVvBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA272#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=3 December 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "minhwa" was coined by [[Yanagi Muneyoshi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=민화 |url=http://folkency.nfm.go.kr/kr/topic/%EB%AF%BC%ED%99%94/6572 |website=Encyclopedia of Korean Folk Culture |publisher=National Folk Museum of Korea |accessdate=15 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Literally "painting of the people" or "popular painting". This type of painting was often the work of anonymous craftsmen who faithfully adhered to the styles, canons and genres inherited from the past. Minhwa also involved a magical dimension. They were believed to possess beneficial virtues and to protect the owner and his family from evil forces. They feature popular themes such as cranes, rocks, water, clouds, the sun, moon, pine-trees, tortoises, insects and flowers.

''Minhwa'' art developed into its present form in the seventeenth century.  The artists were common people who went from place to place, often following festivals, where they would paint for the locals, fulfilling their [[Commission (art)|commissions]] on the spot.  Important stages in life were also marked by the painting of a minhwa picture.  Both common people and nobles would commission these artists.

The paintings worked on a number of levels.  They show figures from folk mythology and legends, symbols of happiness, wealth and health, and scenes of everyday life.  The most common figures were animals that represented power, such as the tiger, or providential circumstances, such as carp, which represent success. The paintings were done on paper and on canvas.  

After a decline during the colonial rule, the art form experienced a short boom until laid low by the [[Korean War]].  In the 1980s, though, there was a revival of Minhwa, the interest and popularity of which persists to this day.

==Genres==
===Magpie and tiger===
{{see also|Tigers in Korean culture}}
''Kkachi horangi'' ({{Korean|hangul=까치호랑이|labels=no}}) is a prominent genre of ''minhwa'' that depicts magpies and tigers. In ''kkachi horangi'' paintings, the tiger, which is intentionally given a ridiculous and stupid appearance (hence its nickname "idiot tiger" 바보호랑이), represents authority and the aristocratic [[yangban]], while the dignified magpie represents the common man. Hence, ''kkachi horangi'' paintings of magpies and tigers were a satire of the hierarchical structure of Joseon's feudal society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=까치호랑이|url=http://folkency.nfm.go.kr/kr/topic/%EA%B9%8C%EC%B9%98%ED%98%B8%EB%9E%91%EC%9D%B4/6565|website=Encyclopedia of Korean Folk Culture|publisher=National Folk Museum of Korea|accessdate=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=KOREA Magazine March 2017|date=2017|publisher=Korean Culture and Information Service|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y3M-DgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT29#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 December 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flower writing===
''Munjado'' ({{Korean|hangul=문자도|hanja=文字圖|labels=no}}), also known as "flower writing" ({{Korean|hangul=꽃글씨|rr=kkotgeulssi|labels=no}}), is a genre of ''minhwa'' that enjoyed popularity in the 18th and 19th centuries, in which large Chinese characters associated with Confucian philosophy are painted as a representation of their meaning, with depictions of related stories and themes painted into the characters themselves.&lt;ref name="Beauty" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=효제문자도|url=http://folkency.nfm.go.kr/kr/topic/%ED%9A%A8%EC%A0%9C%EB%AC%B8%EC%9E%90%EB%8F%84/6603|website=Encyclopedia of Korean Folk Culture|publisher=National Folk Museum of Korea|accessdate=3 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chaekgeori===
''[[Chaekgeori]]'' is a genre of still-life painting that features books as the dominant subject. Originally a court art embraced by the upper class, ''chaekgeori'' spread to the ''minhwa'' folk art of the common class in the 19th century, resulting in more expressionist and abstract depictions, and the diminished prominence of bookshelves as a primary motif.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=책거리|url=http://folkency.nfm.go.kr/kr/topic/%EC%B1%85%EA%B1%B0%EB%A6%AC/6591|website=Encyclopedia of Korean Folk Culture|publisher=National Folk Museum of Korea|accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6320">'''Miriam Chaszczewacki''' or '''Miriam Chaszczewacka''' (1924–1942) was a 15-year-old Jewish girl and Holocaust victim who in 1939 began writing a personal diary about her life in the [[Radomsko]] [[ghetto]] which ended a few days before her assassination in 1942.

== Discovery and publication of the diary ==
Miriam's teacher Stefania Heilbrunn returned to [[Radomsko]], [[Poland]] after [[World War II]] had ended. While she was visiting the city cemetery, she met a Polish woman who gave her a sealed envelope saying "My son has asked me to give this to you. I don't know anything about it" and left. In the envelope Heilbrunn found a notebook with handwriting she recognized as belonging to her former student, Miriam Chaszczewacki. Heilbrunn brought the notebook to [[Israel]] and published its content.&lt;ref name=p344&gt;{{cite book|title=Children of Dust and Heaven : A Diary from Nazi Occupation through the Holocaust|last=Heilbrunn|first=Stefania|date=March 18, 2013|isbn=1481865617|page=344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally the diary was written in [[Polish language|Polish]]. Parts of the diary were published in Hebrew, Yiddish, Polish,  English and German. The original notebook was donated to [[Yad Vashem]].

== Life ==
Miriam's mother Sarah Lavit Zelber, born to a [[Hasidic Judaism|Hassidic]] family was a kindergarten teacher and a public figure. Miriam's father David&lt;ref&gt;תמונתו ופרק לזכרו בספר יזכור ליהדות רדומסקו page 460&lt;/ref&gt; was born in [[Ukraine]]. He opened a Jewish school in Radomsko where he taught Hebrew. This school was later active in the ghetto. Miriam's  brother Nahum was born in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;Children of Dust and Heaven, page 98&lt;/ref&gt; Miriam was a 15-year-old [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] student and a member of a Zionist youth movement when the war began. She is described as a gentle, sensitive, intelligent and talented girl who studied Hebrew in her father's school.&lt;ref&gt;נערה בגיטו, page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; In another testimony, she is described as a shy, romantic and dreamy teenager.&lt;ref name=p86&gt;{{cite book|title=Children of Dust and Heaven : A Diary from Nazi Occupation through the Holocaust|last=Heilbrunn|first=Stefania|date=March 18, 2013|isbn=1481865617|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miriam's father and brother were murdered in the ghetto by the Germans. The father, David, was killed for refusing to board a deportation train.&lt;ref name=p142&gt;{{cite book|title=Children of Dust and Heaven : A Diary from Nazi Occupation through the Holocaust|last=Heilbrunn|first=Stefania|date=March 18, 2013|isbn=1481865617|page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brother Nahum was buried in a mass grave in the Jewish cemetery.&lt;ref name=p184&gt;{{cite book|title=Children of Dust and Heaven : A Diary from Nazi Occupation through the Holocaust|last=Heilbrunn|first=Stefania|date=March 18, 2013|isbn=1481865617|page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chapters of the diary ==
The diary begins with the introductory chapter that describes the events between the summer of 1939 and the occupation of Radomsko by the Germans in September 1939. The second part of the diary consists of 27 dated entries starting at 21 April 1941 describing the events of the war and ghetto life along with the typical account of a teenage girl's emotions.

== Death ==
The last entry in the diary in Miriam's handwriting was on 7 October 1942, when Miriam was 18. Between 9 and 12 October 1942 about 14,000 residents of the ghetto were sent to [[Treblinka]].

In the last page of the notebook appears an entry in a different, adult, handwriting, possibly by the Polish policeman who was the son of the woman who passed the notebook to Stefania Heilbrunn:

&lt;blockquote&gt;On the evening of the 24 October 1942 she surrendered, together with her mother, to a Polish policeman on duty on Limanewskeigo Str. They asked to be taken to the Judenrat, as they have been hiding for a week in a lavatory and had enough of it all. During the last 3 days they ate raw groats. They were taken to the Police station and the next day left with a transport by lorry to [[Częstochowa]].&lt;ref name=p344/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In one of the diary's last entries, about a month before her death, Miriam wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It may seem silly, but only a step away from death I still worry about my diary. I would not want for it to meet a miserable end in an oven or on a rubbish heap. I wish somebody could find it – even if it be only a German – and would read it. I wish that these scribblings, though they record barely a fraction of the cruelties, would one day serve as a true and faithful document of our times.&lt;ref name=p133&gt;{{cite book|title=Children of Dust and Heaven : A Diary from Nazi Occupation through the Holocaust|last=Heilbrunn|first=Stefania|date=March 18, 2013|isbn=1481865617|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''National Endowment for the Arts''' ('''NEA''') is an independent agency of the [[United States federal government]] that offers support and funding for projects exhibiting artistic excellence.&lt;ref name=aboutus&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nea.gov/about/index.html|author=National Endowment for the Arts|title=About Us|accessdate=March 13, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901102346/http://www.nea.gov/about/index.html|archivedate=September 1, 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was created by an act of the [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] in 1965 as an independent agency of the federal government.  The NEA has its offices in [[Washington, D.C.]] It was awarded [[Tony Honors for Excellence in Theatre]] in 1995, as well as the [[Special Tony Award]] in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tonyawards.com/en_US/nominees/winners.html |title=The 2016 Tony Awards: Winners |accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The NEA is "dedicated to supporting excellence in the arts, both new and established; bringing the arts to all Americans; and providing leadership in arts education".&lt;ref name=aboutus /&gt;

Between 1965 and 2008, the agency has made in excess of 128,000 grants, totaling more than $5 billion. From the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, Congress granted the NEA an annual funding of between $160 and $180&amp;nbsp;million. In 1996, Congress cut the NEA funding to $99.5&amp;nbsp;million as a result of pressure from conservative groups, including the [[American Family Association]], who criticized the agency for using tax dollars to fund highly controversial artists such as [[Barbara DeGenevieve]], [[Andres Serrano]], [[Robert Mapplethorpe]], and the performance artists known as the "[[NEA Four]]". Since 1996, the NEA has partially rebounded with a 2015 budget of $146.21&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alternet.org/culture/culturally-impoverished-us-nea-spends-140th-what-germany-doles-out-arts-capital ]{{dead link|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For FY 2010, the budget reached the level it was at during the mid-1990s at $167.5 million&lt;ref name=budget&gt;[http://www.arts.gov/about/Budget/AppropriationsHistory.html National Endowment for the Arts Appropriations History], NEA&lt;/ref&gt; but fell again in FY 2011 with a budget of $154 million.&lt;ref name=budget/&gt;

==Governance==
The NEA is governed by a Chairman appointed by the President to a four-year term and confirmed by Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Cohen (August 7, 2013) [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/08/arts/design/vacancies-hamper-agencies-for-arts.html Vacancies Hamper Agencies for Arts] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The NEA's advisory committee, the National Council on the Arts,&lt;!--do not wikilink this; it's a by-country list that just links back here--&gt; advises the Chairman on policies and programs, as well as reviewing grant applications, fundraising guidelines, and leadership initiative. This body consists of 14 individuals appointed by the President for their expertise and knowledge in the arts, in addition to six ''[[Ex officio member|ex officio]]'' members of Congress who serve in a non-voting capacity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nea.gov/about/NCA/About_NCA.html National Council on the Arts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216180201/http://nea.gov/about/NCA/About_NCA.html |date=2010-12-16 }}, [http://www.nea.gov/ nea.gov]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081106001247/http://www.nea.gov/ |date=2008-11-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 12, 2014, Dr. Jane Chu was confirmed as the 11th Chair of the NEA by the Senate, after having been nominated by President [[Barack Obama]] in February of the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/02/13/president-obama-announces-his-intent-nominate-jane-chu-chairman-national|title=President Obama Announces his Intent to Nominate Jane Chu as Chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts|publisher=|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chu.confirmation.washingtonpost" /&gt;

==Grantmaking==
The NEA offers grants in the categories of: 1) Grants for Arts Projects, 2) National Initiatives, and 3) Partnership Agreements. Grants for Arts Projects support exemplary projects in the discipline categories of artist communities, arts education, dance, design, folk and traditional arts, [[literature]], local arts agencies, media arts, museums, music, musical theater, opera, presenting (including multidisciplinary art forms), theater, and visual arts.
The NEA also grants individual fellowships in literature to creative writers and translators of exceptional talent in the areas of prose and poetry.

The NEA has partnerships in the areas of state and regional, federal, international activities, and design. The state arts agencies and regional arts organizations are the NEA's primary partners in serving the American people through the arts. Forty percent of all NEA funding goes to the state arts agencies and regional arts organizations. Additionally, the NEA awards three Lifetime Honors: NEA [[National Heritage Fellowships]] to master folk and traditional artists, NEA Jazz Masters Fellowships to jazz musicians and advocates, and NEA Opera Honors to individuals who have made extraordinary contributions to opera in the United States. The NEA also manages the [[National Medal of Arts]], awarded annually by the President.

===Relative scope of funding===
Artist [[William Powhida]] has noted that "in one single auction, wealthy collectors bought almost a billion dollars in contemporary art at [[Christie's]] in New York." He further commented: "If you had a 2 percent tax just on the auctions in New York you could probably double the NEA budget in two nights."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode

==Lifetime Honors==
The NEA is the federal agency responsible for recognizing outstanding achievement in the arts. It does this by awarding three lifetime achievement awards. The [[NEA Jazz Masters|NEA Jazz Masters Fellowships]] is awarded to individuals who have made significant contributions to the art of jazz. The NEA National Heritage Fellowships is awarded for artistic excellence and accomplishments for American's folk and traditional arts. The [[List of National Medal of Arts recipients|National Medal of Arts]] is awarded by the [[President of the United States]] and NEA for outstanding contributions to the excellence, growth, support, and availability of the arts in the United States.

==Controversy==

===1981 attempts to abolish===
Upon entering office in 1981, the incoming [[Ronald Reagan]] administration intended to push Congress to abolish the NEA completely over a three-year period. Reagan's first director of the Office of Management and Budget, [[David A. Stockman]], thought the NEA and the National Endowment for the Humanities were "good [departments] to simply bring to a halt because they went too far, and they would be easy to defeat." Another proposal would have halved the arts endowment budget. However, these plans were abandoned when the President's special task force on the arts and humanities, which included close Reagan allies such as conservatives [[Charlton Heston]] and [[Joseph Coors]], discovered "the needs involved and benefits of past assistance," concluding that continued federal support was important. Frank Hodsoll became the chairman of the NEA in 1981, and while the department's budget decreased from $158.8 million in 1981 to $143.5 million, by 1989 it was $169.1 million, the highest it had ever been.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Book Discloses That Reagan Planned To Kill National Endowment for Arts |author=[[William H.

===1989 objections===
In 1989, [[Donald Wildmon]] of the [[American Family Association]] held a press conference attacking what he called "anti-Christian bigotry," in an exhibition by photographer [[Andres Serrano]]. The work at the center of the controversy was ''[[Piss Christ]]'', a photo of a plastic [[crucifix]] submerged in a vial of an amber fluid described by the artist as his own urine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Monaco|title=Understanding Society, Culture, and Television|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9viccUYUSVYC|year=2000|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-97095-6|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=9viccUYUSVYC&amp;pg=PA100 100]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Republican Senators [[Jesse Helms]] and [[Al D'Amato]] began to rally against the NEA, and expanded the attack to include other artists. Prominent conservative Christian figures including [[Pat Robertson]] of the [[700 Club]] and [[Pat Buchanan]] joined the attacks. Republican representative [[Dick Armey]], an opponent of federal arts funding, began to attack a planned exhibition of photographs by [[Robert Mapplethorpe]] at the [[Corcoran Museum of Art]] that was to receive NEA support.

On June 12, 1989, The Corcoran cancelled the Mapplethorpe exhibition, saying that it did not want to "adversely affect the NEA's congressional appropriations." The [[Washington Project for the Arts]] later hosted the Mapplethorpe show. The cancellation was highly criticized and in September, 1989, the Director of the Corcoran gallery, Christina Orr-Cahill, issued a formal statement of apology saying, "The Corcoran Gallery of Art in attempting to defuse the NEA funding controversy by removing itself from the political spotlight, has instead found itself in the center of controversy. By withdrawing from the Mapplethorpe exhibition, we, the board of trustees and the director, have inadvertently offended many members of the arts community which we deeply regret. Our course in the future will be to support art, artists and freedom of expression."&lt;ref name=maplethorpe&gt;{{cite web|last=Quigley|first=Margaret|title=The Mapplethorpe Censorship Controversy|url=http://www.publiceye.org/theocrat/Mapplethorpe_Chrono.html |publisher=PublicEye.org/[[Political Research Associates]]|accessdate=2 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though this controversy inspired congressional debate about appropriations to the NEA, including proposed restrictions on the content of NEA-supported work and their grantmaking guidelines, efforts to defund the NEA failed.&lt;ref&gt;C.

===1990 performance artists vetoed===
{{Main|NEA Four}}

Conservative media continued to attack individual artists whose NEA-supported work was deemed controversial. The "NEA Four", [[Karen Finley]], [[Tim Miller (performance artist)|Tim Miller]], [[John Fleck (actor)|John Fleck]], and [[Holly Hughes (performance artist)|Holly Hughes]], were [[performance art]]ists whose proposed grants from the [[United States]] government's National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) were vetoed by [[John Frohnmayer]] in June 1990. Grants were overtly vetoed on the basis of subject matter after the artists had successfully passed through a [[peer review (disambiguation)|peer review]] process. The artists won their case in court in 1993 and were awarded amounts equal to the grant money in question, though the case would make its way to the [[United States Supreme Court]] in ''[[National Endowment for the Arts v. Finley]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''National Endowment for the Arts v. Finley'', 524 U.S. 569, (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; The case centered on subsection (d)(1) of {{USC|20|954}} which provides that the NEA Chairperson shall ensure that artistic excellence and artistic merit are the criteria by which applications are judged. The court ruled in {{ussc|524|569|1998}}, that Section 954(d)(1) is facially valid, as it neither inherently interferes with First Amendment rights nor violates constitutional vagueness principles.

===1995–1997 congressional attacks===
The [[United States elections, 1994|1994 midterm elections]] cleared the way for House Speaker [[Newt Gingrich]] to lead a renewed attack on the NEA. Gingrich had called for the NEA to be eliminated completely along with the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] and the [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]]. While some in Congress attacked the funding of controversial artists, others argued the endowment was wasteful and elitist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Robert | last=Hughes | coauthors= |authorlink=Robert Hughes (critic) | title=Pulling the Fuse on Culture | date=August 7, 1995 | publisher= | url =http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,983279,00.html | work =[[TIME]] | pages = | accessdate =October 3, 2009 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite massive budget cutbacks and the end of grants to individual artists, Gingrich ultimately failed in his push to eliminate the endowment.

===2009 conference call===
In mid-2009, the NEA came under controversy again when it was revealed on a website run by conservative commentator [[Andrew Breitbart]] that then-Communications Director [[Yosi Sergant]] had participated in an August 10, 2009 conference call that allegedly directed artists to create works of art promoting President [[Barack Obama]]'s domestic agenda.&lt;ref name="Conference 1"&gt;{{cite web |title=NEA Reassigns Communications Director Following Uproar Over Obama Initiative |url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/09/11/nea-reassigns-communications-director-following-uproar-obama-initiative/ |date=11 September 2009 |publisher=FOX News |accessdate=September 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Conference 2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Audiotape Reveals Artists Being Asked to Support Obama's Agenda |url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/09/21/audiotape-controversial-nea-conference-revealed/ |date=September 21, 2009 |publisher=FOX News |accessdate=September 21, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924234053/http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/09/21/audiotape-controversial-nea-conference-revealed/ |archivedate=September 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "I would encourage you to pick something, whether it's health care, education, the environment, you know, there's four key areas that the corporation has identified as the areas of service," Sergant said on the call, making reference to the four areas of focus earlier outlined by Nell Abernathy, Director of Outreach for United We Serve. Suggested areas of focus mentioned in the call included preventative care, child nutrition, community cleanups, trail maintenance, reading tutoring, and homelessness. At another point he said, "This is just the beginning. This is the first telephone call of a brand new conversation. We are just now learning how to really bring this community together to speak with the government. What that looks like legally. We're still trying to figure out the laws of putting government websites of Facebook and the use of Twitter. This is all being sorted out. We are participating in history as it's being made, so bear with us as we learn the language so that we can speak to each other safely. And we can really work together to move the needle to get stuff done."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=After 'Inappropriate' NEA Conference Call, White House Pushes New Guidelines |url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2009/09/after-inappropriate-nea-conference-call-white-house-pushes-new-guidelines.html |publisher=ABC News |date=September 22, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711225650/http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2009/09/after-inappropriate-nea-conference-call-white-house-pushes-new-guidelines.html |archivedate=July 11, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NEA countered the allegations by asserting that Sergant had acted unilaterally and without the approval of then-Acting Chairman Patrice Walker Powell, and that the call was not a means to promote any legislative agenda but rather to inform members of the arts community of an opportunity to become involved in volunteerism through the United We Serve program. They also noted that the call had nothing to do with grantmaking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nea.gov/news/news09/statement.html STATEMENT FROM NEA CHAIRMAN ROCCO LANDESMAN] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090926091014/http://www.nea.gov/news/news09/statement.html |date=2009-09-26 }}, September 22, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proposed defunding===
The budget outline submitted by President Trump on March 16, 2017, to Congress would eliminate all funding for the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=3:02 PM ET |url=https://www.npr.org/2017/03/16/520401246/trumps-budget-plan-cuts-funding-for-arts-humanities-and-public-media |title=Trump Budget Cuts Funding For Arts, Humanities Endowments And Corporation For Public Broadcasting |publisher=NPR |date=March 16, 2017|accessdate=March 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McPhee |first=Ryan |url=http://www.playbill.com/article/trump-administrations-budget-proposal-eliminates-national-endowment-for-the-arts |title=Trump Administration's Budget Proposal Eliminates National Endowment for the Arts |work=Playbill |date=March 16, 2017 |accessdate=March 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congress approved a budget that retained NEA funding. The White House budget proposed for fiscal year 2018 again called for elimination of funding, but Congress retained the funding for another year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.americansforthearts.org/news-room/arts-mobilization-center/national-endowment-for-the-arts-update-trump-fy2018-budget-proposal-calls-for-elimination-of-nea National Endowment for the Arts Update: Trump FY2018 Budget Proposal Calls for Elimination of NEA Funding]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nocturne painting''' is a term coined by [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]] to describe a painting style that depicts scenes evocative of the night or subjects as they appear in a veil of light, in twilight, or in the absence of direct light. In a broader usage, the term has come to refer to any  [[Night in paintings (Western art)|painting of a night scene]],&lt;ref&gt;Lawton, Denis. (1992). ''Education And Politics For The 1990s: Conflict Or Consensus?'' (edition reprint). Psychology Press. p. 150. {{ISBN|0750700793}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or night-piece, such as [[Rembrandt]]'s ''[[The Night Watch (painting)|The Night Watch]]''.

Whistler used the term within the title of his works to represent paintings with a "dreamy, pensive mood" by applying a musical name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dia.org/exhibitions/whistlersite/8.htm |title=Tonalism and the "Nocturne  |publisher=Detroit Institute of Arts |date= |accessdate=2012-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also titled (and retitled) works using other terms associated with music, such as a "symphony", "harmony", "study" or "arrangement", to emphasize the tonal qualities and the composition and to de-emphasize the narrative content.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Ronald and Anne Koval. (2002). ''James McNeill Whistler: Beyond the Myth.'' De Capo Press. p. 186. {{ISBN|0-786-71032-2}}. (''Note: need to verify this was the edition used.'')&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the term "nocturne" can be associated with the [[Tonalism]] movement of the American of the late 19th century and early 20th century which is "characterized by soft, diffused light, muted tones and hazy outlined objects, all of which imbue the works with a strong sense of mood."&lt;ref&gt;[[Joan Marter|Marter, Joan]]. (2011). ''The Grove Encyclopedia of American Art, Volume 1'' Oxford University Press. p. 54. {{ISBN|0195335791}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with winter scenes, nocturnes were a common Tonalist theme.&lt;ref&gt;Conrads, Margaret C.

Hudson Hills. p. 148. {{ISBN|1555950507}}.&lt;/ref&gt;[[Frederic Remington]] used the term as well for his nocturne scenes of the [[American Old West]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nga.gov/feature/remington/remington08.shtm |title=Artistic experiments |publisher=National Gallery of Art |date= |accessdate=2012-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nga.gov/feature/remington/remington09.shtm |title=18 images of Remington’s nocturnes on 18 web pages |publisher=National Gallery of Art |date= |accessdate=2012-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rembrandt’s nocturnes==
In northern [[Europe]], the [[Dutch Golden Age]] produced one of the greatest artists of all time. The first artist to paint scenes on a regular basis in the nocturne mode was [[Rembrandt van Rijn]] (1606–1669). Many of his portraits were also painted using a nocturne method. As in ''The Mill'' (1645), most of his landscapes were painted to evoke a sense of the nocturne, which could be expressed in either a calm or stormy manner.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2006/feb/11/art|title=The Enduring Genius of Rembrandt|author=[[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]]|date=11 February 2006|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Remington painted many of his nocturnes in the last years of his life, when he was transitioning from a career as an [[illustrator]] to that of a fine artist and had chosen [[American Impressionism|Impressionism]] as the style in which he worked at the time.

The [[Norse mythology]], preserved in such ancient [[Iceland]]ic texts as the [[Poetic Edda]], the [[Prose Edda]], and other lays and sagas, was little known outside [[Scandinavia]] until the 19th century. With the widespread publication of Norse myths and legends at this time, references to the Norse gods and heroes spread into European literary culture, especially in Scandinavia, Germany, and Britain. In the later 20th century, references to Norse mythology became common in science fiction and fantasy literature, role-playing games, and eventually other cultural products such as Japanese animation.

==Reintroduction to popular culture==
Antiquaries of the 19th century such as [[George Webbe Dasent]] brought the mythology of Scandinavia back to the popular notice of many people in Germany and England; in both cases, Norse mythology was recognized as the latest surviving form of [[Germanic paganism]]. Germany and England were Christianized far earlier than the Scandinavian countries and much of their own traditions were lost.

In Britain, [[William Morris]] composed poetry such as ''[[The Story of Sigurd the Volsung and the Fall of the Niblungs|Sigurd the Volsung]]'' on Norse legendary subjects as well as translating Icelandic sagas into English. In Germany, [[Richard Wagner]] borrowed characters and themes from Norse mythology to compose the four operas that make up ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' (''The Ring of the Nibelung''), though he also utilized medieval German sources and Germanized the names of the Norse gods.

*[[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s fantasy works'' [[The Hobbit]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' (1955), and ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' (1977) were admitted by its author to be heavily influenced by the myths of the Northern Europeans.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} As that work became popular, elements of its fantasy world moved steadily into popular perceptions of the fantasy genre. In nearly any modern fantasy novel today can be found such Germanic creatures as elves, dwarfs and trolls.
*Children's writer [[Alan Garner]] borrowed many Norse concepts, such as the tale of [[Freyja]]'s necklace ''[[Brísingamen]]'' and the hard winter (''[[Fimbulwinter]]'') which portends the end of the world, [[Ragnarok]] in his classic story, ''[[The Weirdstone of Brisingamen]]'' (1960).

Furthermore, the sword wielded by Sif more than likely references the sword that was jammed in between the jaws of [[Fenris]] by the [[Æsir]].
* In the role-playing game [[Etrian Odyssey]], the [[Yggdrasil]] Tree is a recurring plot element of great relevance and significance that appears on every game of the series.

Nora's female gender alludes to the story where Thor disguised himself as Freyja in order to retrieve his hammer from a giant who wanted the goddess as his wife.
* The ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game]]'' has a series of cards the (Nordic and Aesir archetypes) based on Norse gods and other mythological creatures.

'''''On Cinema''''' (also called '''''On Cinema at the Cinema''''' for the video series) is an [[United States|American]] comedic film review [[podcast]] and [[web series]] starring [[Tim Heidecker]] and [[Gregg Turkington]]. The duo appear as a pair of hapless movie reviewers (using their own names). The show started as an independently released [[podcast]] from 2011 to 2013, before being picked up as a professionally produced web video series by [[Thing X]] in 2012–13 for its first two seasons, and then moving to [[Adult Swim.com]] in 2013. It has aired 10 seasons, plus one special
season titled "The Trial".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Evans |first=Bradford |url=http://splitsider.com/2012/11/tim-heidecker-and-gregg-turkington-are-your-new-siskel-ebert/ |title=Tim Heidecker and Gregg Turkington Are Your New Siskel &amp; Ebert |publisher=[[Splitsider]] |date=2012-11-09 |accessdate=2015-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, ''On Cinema'' spawned a spinoff web series in its fifth season, ''[[Decker (series)|Decker]],'' a simultaneous spoof of political-thrillers and homebrew video intended for the web. It later became a [[TV series]], and as of 2018, it has aired 6 seasons of episodes total on Adultswim.com and [[Adult Swim]].

Heidecker and Turkington began making the podcast as a prank and a mockery of the "self-indulgence" of the podcasting community.&lt;ref name="dailycal1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailycal.org/2014/01/25/faux-movie-review-web-series-cinema-cinema-develops-real-future/ |title=Faux movie-review web series 'On Cinema at the Cinema' develops a real future |publisher=Dailycal.org |date=2014-01-25 |accessdate=2015-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Heidecker and Turkington have created an immersive universe through ''On Cinema'' and ''Decker.'' A live [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] special is also done every year, streamed via [[YouTube]], with interactive elements for fans, such as polling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Evans |first=Bradford |url=http://splitsider.com/2014/02/tim-heidecker-and-gregg-turkington-are-doing-a-live-oscars-special/ |title=Tim Heidecker and Gregg Turkington Are Doing a Live Oscars Special |publisher=Splitsider |date=2014-02-25 |accessdate=2015-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several seasons of ''On Cinema'' have discernible multi-episode plot arcs as Heidecker and Turkington explore the dynamic and characters they have created both in the series' episodes and, simultaneously, on social media, through [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]], and [[YouTube]].&lt;ref name="mocktrial"&gt;{{cite web|title="Tim Heidecker is putting himself on trial for murder right now as part of On Cinema's latest absurd twist"|url=https://www.avclub.com/tim-heidecker-is-putting-himself-on-trial-for-murder-ri-1820494473|website=[[The A.V. Club]]|date=15 November 2017|author=William Hughes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show has a dedicated [[cult following]] of fans who play along with the storylines via social media, often taking sides as "GreggHeads" or "TimHeads". Heidecker and Turkington also started ''Decker-Con'', where they appear in character and interact with fans.&lt;ref name="fans"&gt;{{cite web|title="'Decker,' 'On Cinema' and the various, intertwined universes of comedian Tim Heidecker"|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/la-ca-st-tim-heidecker-20170609-story.html|publisher=''[[The L.A. Times]]''|date=9 June 2017|author=Robert Llyod}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Summer of 2018, Heidecker and Turkington initiated a nationwide ''On Cinema Live!'' tour with special guests from the On Cinema/Decker universe and special content.&lt;ref name="Barsanti"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://news.avclub.com/tim-heidecker-and-gregg-turkington-are-taking-on-cinema-1826240596 |title=Tim Heidecker and Gregg Turkington are taking On Cinema At The Cinema to cinemas |last=Barsanti |first=Sam |website=''[[The A.V.

==Premise==
Early audio episodes of ''On Cinema'' were quite short, frequently no more than one or two minutes long. Heidecker and Turkington would "review" films on these podcasts without actually providing any meaningful information or critical insight. Nearly every film that has been discussed or mentioned on ''On Cinema'' since the podcast's inception has received a "5 bags of popcorn" rating on a scale of five from the two reviewers, regardless of its reception elsewhere in the press or with the viewing public.

With the series' growth into an online video series, episodes grew to an average length of eight to twelve minutes. Although reviewing films remains a central conceit, the focus of the series quickly shifted from a mockery of amateur podcasting to an extended character study of the two podcasters. Heidecker, in character on ''On Cinema'', frequently uses his time on camera to discuss anything on his character's mind except film, especially his bizarre ailments, personal crises, and [[Conservatism in the United States|right-wing political views]], or to simply berate and belittle Turkington. Turkington's character fancies himself a "film expert," his primary qualification being an enormous collection of forgotten and arguably forgettable mainstream films from the 1980s and 1990s on [[VHS]]. The series continues to provide reviews that purposely offer no real critical insight. Recent seasons as of 2018 have seen Tim lose interest in reviewing and start a band first named ''Dekkar'' then ''DKR'' .

Guest appearances  have included [[Jordan Hoffman]], [[Jimmy McNichol]], [[Joe Estevez]], [[Lawrence Turman]], [[Sally Kellerman]], [[Candy Clark]], [[Mark Proksch]], [[John Aprea]], [[Peyton Reed]], and [[Nicholas Meyer]], some of whom also appear in the ''[[Decker (TV series)|Decker]]'' series.

==Series overview==
{{main|List of On Cinema episodes}}
{{see also|List of Decker episodes}}
{{:List of On Cinema episodes}}

===Podcast===
The ''On Cinema'' podcast was produced independently by Tim and Gregg. The podcast consists of Tim, along with Gregg as a "special guest" for every episode, covering movies poorly and with little insight, and often engaging in arguments. Gregg later developed a more pretentious "film buff" persona, and Tim took a turn to being obnoxiously political, sometimes devoting entire episodes to conspiracy theories, much to the chagrin of Gregg.

Another running joke that was carried over to the video series is Gregg's refusal to believe that ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]'' is really "Star Trek II," instead often believing stubbornly that ''[[Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home]]'' is the real Star Trek II.

===Season 1===
Starting this season, the show is now in video format via [[Thing X]].com, as well as having its name changed to ''On Cinema at the Cinema''. The series is similar to the podcast, but this time episodes always take place on a set meant to look like a movie theatre. Gregg is still never acknowledged as more than a guest each episode, and starts his weekly segments "Popcorn Classics" and "On Cinema On Location" where he brings in obscure, forgotten VHS movies to showcase and travels to filming locations of obscure movies, respectively. Tim begins using "60 second soap box" to talk about current political issues with a conservative narrative, much to the continued annoyance of Gregg. With the start of the web series, Tim uses a rating scale of "bags of popcorn" ranging from 0–5, and while Gregg uses five as a max, Tim often goes overboard giving scores of "6 bags" or even more, creating tension and confusion throughout the season. Most of the films reviewed get a score of at least "5 bags" from both reviewers.

===Season 2===
Tim reveals he has [[Coagulation|blood clotting]] in his brain but does not want to get surgery because of "side effects, the whole medical industry, and [[Obamacare]]" while Gregg pushes for him to get surgery. In episode 208, Tim introduces the first special guest, Ayaka, a foreign exchange student from Japan staying with Tim's family.

The first Live On Cinema Oscar Special airs, where Tim and Gregg live stream during the [[Oscars]] and drink alcohol. Tim gets very drunk and throws up on some of Gregg's VHS tapes which causes Gregg to walk off the set.

===Season 3===
Season 3 moved the series from [[Thing X]] to [[Adultswim.com]]. The season begins with Tim in a head bandage and clearly in physical pain as he went through with surgery for his blood clots. As a result of him going through the surgery, Tim's wife divorces him and this is the last time his family is referred to throughout the series. Gregg begins his goal of making the ''[[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of World Records]]'' by becoming the first person in history to watch 500 movies in 500 days. Tim kicks Gregg off the show after Gregg drives all the way from [[Hollywood]] to [[San Francisco]] to make a video alleging the location of a ''[[Star Trek]]'' filming location, after he and Tim had disagreed on it before. [[John Aprea]] and Ayaka are guests on the next episode, where Tim reveals he is dating Ayaka and says he loves her for the first time. In the season finale, Gregg returns to the show as Ayaka was deported back to Japan.

===Season 4===
Tim begins season four with many health problems and introduces his personal doctor, Dr. San (played by [[Zac Holtzman]]), an alternative medical doctor treating Tim with [[acupuncture]], [[transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation]] and other "natural" medicines. Dr. San begins coming onto the set with Tim, despite Gregg's objections. However, Tim's face becomes infected from the acupuncture and he denounces Dr. San.

Ayaka sends a letter to Tim on the show saying she is pregnant with Tim's child.

The second Live Oscar Special, Tim and Gregg drink (with Tim getting much drunker than Gregg). We are introduced to [[Mark Proksch]] who does impersonations of [[W.C. Fields]] and [[Charlie Chaplin]].

===Season 5===
Tim moves to [[Jackson Hole]], [[Wyoming]] and buys a motorcycle to commute back and forth between there and Hollywood for the On Cinema taping.

Tim announces that Ayaka has had an [[abortion]], despite remaining [[pro-life]] on the topic, saying "when you are in that situation, choices have to be on the table." However, Gregg brings Ayaka onto On Cinema via [[Skype]] from Japan, revealing she did go through with the pregnancy and naming the boy Tom Cruise Heidecker Junior, after the actor [[Tom Cruise]]. Ayaka moves back to America with Tom Cruise Junior and into Gregg's apartment. This upsets Tim and he moves permanently to Jackson Hole. He makes Gregg host of the show and hands off all responsibilities to him in the season finale.

===Season 6===
Gregg begins his first season as host, but after he is unable to find a guest, he records himself having conversations with himself and plays VHS video of his conversation during the episode.

Tim returns as host in episode 602 after he realized his new friends in Jackson Hole were [[white supremacists]]. He rekindles his relationship with Ayaka and moves into Gregg's apartment with her and Tom Cruise Junior. In the season finale, Tim proposes to Ayaka and she accepts.

The third Live Oscar Special airs, while Tim and Gregg get drunk and Tim, once again, gets much drunker than Gregg and becomes belligerent. [[Peyton Reed]] comes on the Special to promote his new film ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]'' and announces that Gregg has been cast as a minor character in the movie, which upsets Tim. In the finale segment, Gregg introduces [[James Dean]], the former actor who was believed to be dead since 1955. After reading on a message board about how Dean faked his own death and wrote a memoir called "I'm Alive: How I Faked my own Death" he brings Dean on set as his return to the public. Tim does not believe this is the real James Dean, leading to him verbally and physically threatening Dean before trashing the set.

===Season 7===
Gregg moves to [[Victorville, California]] and opens the Victorville Film Archives in a storage locker, where he also lives.

Tim gives ''Ant-Man'' a rare one-bag of popcorn which upsets Gregg, leading to him accusing Tim of paying $15,000 to have a minor role in the new ''[[Fantastic Four (2015 film)|Fantastic Four]]'' movie, which Tim denies.

After meeting a man at [[Guitar Center]] named Axiom, Tim starts a rock band named "Dekkar" with him. Their debut single Empty Bottle is released on the show, which upsets Gregg as it is not movie related and was played instead of his Popcorn Classic segment.

Gregg tells Tim that Dr. San, who Tim has been looking for since he infected Tim's face with dirty needles in acupuncture in season four, is Ayaka's boss at her job. Tim walks off the set angry that he had not realized this. However, the next episode is "The Doctor San Forgiveness Special" where both Tim and Dr. San forgive each other. Dr. San takes over as Tom Cruise Junior's new [[Pediatrics|pediatric doctor]].

By the season seven finale, Tim announces that Tom Cruise Junior has died. He plays a musical tribute to his son with Axiom and Dr. San.

The fourth Live Oscar Special is the biggest one yet, with periodic musical performances by Dekkar (much to the annoyance of Gregg), the "Oscar Olympics" featuring three games, officiated by [[Joe Estevez]], and a DNA test by Dr. San of James Dean, which proves that he is in fact, James Dean. Tim hides the fact he has been drinking alcohol during the Special while no one else is, and he becomes angered by the DNA results. He proceeds to kick Dr. San off the set. An animated rendering of Tom Cruise Junior as a young adult comes on stage, in which Tim and the animated Tom Cruise Junior come out [[Anti-vaccination|against vaccination]].

===Season 8===
Season eight moves the show to Victorville, where Tim has now moved into the storage unit with Gregg. They both buy an abandoned [[movie theater]] and open it as the "Victorville Film Center" where instead of playing new releases, a nightly showing from Gregg's VHS collection of Popcorn Classics is played. Attendance is minimal because of the obscurity of the films. Mark Proksch is hired as a concessions cashier.

Dr. San prescribes Tim a "nutritional vape system" in which Tim replaces all meals and food with an [[electronic cigarette]] full of supposed nutrients. However, Tim's physical condition worsens as the season progresses, as he comes to the set sweating, bruised, hallucinating, and unfocused. Despite this, he continues to use his nutritional vape system. After he cannot take the physical pain and symptoms of the vape system, Tim goes to an actual doctor who informs him the vape and his blood is full of [[Lsd]], [[cocaine]], and multiple other drugs – both legal and illegal. Tim quits the vape system and swears off Dr. San once again. Tim announces that Ayaka is pregnant with their second child. After Tim tries to get Ayaka to get an abortion, she leaves him and moves back to Japan. Tim begins a romantic relationship with Axiom's sister, Juliana.

A fire is started in the storage unit after Tim's vape pen overheats one night, burning the entire facility down including the Victorville Film Archive. Tim suffers [[third degree burn]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s on all of his body, including his face and hands. After insurance will not cover the cost of the fire, he returns to the show in bandages so he can keep working to pay for the damages and lawsuits, which exceed $1,000,000 according to Gregg.

However, in Tim's return to On Cinema, he is surprised by an intervention by Gregg, Joe Estevez, John Aprea, Mark Proksch, Ayaka, Ayaka's father, and Axiom. They encourage Tim to live a healthier life, which upsets Tim. He yells and kicks everyone but Axiom out, and announces plans to start an [[electronic music]] version of Dekkar, now called "DKR".

The season finale ends with a remixed, electronic version of Empty Bottle and Tim announcing that Juliana is now pregnant with his child while Ayaka will go through with her pregnancy too.

===Season 9===
Season nine begins with Gregg informing the audience that the Victorville Film Center has burnt down while he speculates Tim may have done it to collect insurance money.

After Gregg and Tim move back to Hollywood, Tim opens up "Six Bag Cinemas", a new movie theater concept with recliner chairs and a waiter (who is Mark) that brings food to customers during the movie. Gregg constantly criticizes the theater and food.

After Tim stops using the facial cream for the burns on his face, his skin dies and he needs a [[skin transplant]]. After a selection process in which Tim volunteers most of the potential donors himself, Manuel from DKR is chosen and donates skin off of his lower back and buttocks to Tim.

Tim and Dr. San are arrested and jailed on [[murder]] and [[manslaughter]] charges. At Tim's "Electric Sun Desert Music Festival" in [[Apple Valley, California]], Dr. San allegedly gave out free samples of his nutritional vape system, the same one Tim uses, resulting in 20 deaths.  Gregg takes over as host with Mark as his co-host, and the two spend an entire episode blaming Tim instead of reviewing movies.

Tim returns on [[bail]], and finishes the last three episodes of the season with Turkington. Together with his lawyer, Doug Lyman, Tim has decided to pin the 20 deaths on Dr. San and the Apple Valley authorities who did not respond in time. In the season finale, it is revealed that Dr. San has committed suicide in jail, and that the relatives of the 20 who died are now primarily blaming Tim for the deaths. At the end of the final episode, Tim reveals to Gregg that he will never forget what Gregg said about him on the show, no matter what happens to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.avclub.com/tim-heidecker-and-gregg-turkington-s-movie-review-serie-1798257567 |title=Tim Heidecker and Gregg Turkington's movie review series returns next month |website=[[The A.V. Club]]}} by ''[[The A.V. Club]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Trial===
A special event, titled "The Trial", began on November 15, 2017, streaming on Adult Swim's website with the trial of Tim Heidecker for the death of the "Electric Sun 20". Tim was found not guilty of the death of one of the 20, as that victim died of a heroin overdose. A [[mistrial]] was called for the remaining 19, due to a [[hung jury]] with 11 guilty and 1 not guilty verdicts. Gregg accused Tim of bribing the juror who voted not guilty.

Director and writer [[Nicholas Meyer]] appears as one of the testifiers in an ongoing joke alluding to a long-standing disagreement between Tim and Gregg as to whether or not San Francisco is the setting for the film "Star Trek II." &lt;ref name="mocktrial"/&gt;

===Season X ===
During the Fifth Oscar Special, Mark got locked tight into a [[standard diving dress]] while doing an impression of [[Richard Dreyfuss]] character in the [[Jaws (film)|Jaws]] movie and had to be hospitalized for [[asphyxiation]].

Tim returns from the trial free from prison but facing a [[civil suit]] from one of the families of the Electric Sun 19. His assets, including On Cinema and Decker, are being seized and he claims he might soon be facing bankruptcy. After threatening to commit suicide and with help from his attorney (Mark Dwyer), Tim manages to convince the Delgado family to let him try to earn money for them with his various assets. The Delgado's and Tim's Attorney like the show after Episode 7, and hire Gregg as the managing editor of the newly incorporated Delgado Media Holding company, effectively giving him creative control on On Cinema.

The intro and production set have been upgraded, and the show now has a sponsor by name of Rio Jenesis,&lt;ref name="riojenesis"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.riojenesis.com/ |title=Rio Jenesis |accessdate=2018-04-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a protein shake company that creates a "germ shield", of which Tim is now consuming. Gregg begins writing letters to [[Tim Burton]], questioning why he didn't work with [[Johnny Depp]] in ''[[Sherlock Gnomes]]''. He also announces that he has resurrected his film archives, which appears to be several bins full of VHS tapes (later revealed to be stocked in Mark Proksch hospital room) and is now collecting and wearing movie promotional hats to Tim's vocal displeasure. Episodes 4 through 6 were filmed in [[360-degree video]].

As of Episode 7, the show has returned to form with a stronger focus on movies than it had previously had in the last several seasons. However, this is in the context of Tim needing to turn the show around, with him openly discussing the possibility of suicide if it doesn't become more successful. The next three episodes, 8–10, saw Gregg's role on the show increasingly become that of the host, while Tim's role was diminished, allowing for more of Gregg's segments, including Popcorn Classics, to become larger segments in each episode. These changes coincided with Gregg's new role as the managing editor in On Cinema's parent company.  In episode 10, the season finale, Tim threw a fit of rage and insulted the Delgados while announcing his wish to campaign for the post of [[district attorney]] of the [[San Bernardino County]].

==Production==
Heidecker has stated that On Cinema was started out of a desire to mock the podcasting community.&lt;ref name="dailycal1"/&gt; The first episode was recorded on set of ''[[The Comedy]]'', where Heidecker and Turkington were working together, after Heidecker proposed the idea between takes.&lt;ref name="fans"/&gt;
In April 2017, On Cinema initiated a [[Patreon]] page for funding, most of it going to the Oscar specials, with some of the higher options including receiving producer credits, walk-on roles for the Oscar specials, or live custom [[Skype]] reviews from [[Gregg Turkington]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.patreon.com/oncinema On Cinema Patreon]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The show has a dedicated [[cult following]] of fans who interact with the storylines via social media, often taking sides as "GreggHeads" or "TimHeads" in the frequent personal conflicts between the hosts which are often only tangentially, if at all, related to films or cinema.&lt;ref name="fans"/&gt; During the annual live Oscar special, Tim and Gregg both frequently provide interactive elements via online polls for fans to vote on. This cult following is especially found on [[YouTube]], [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]], the latter through Gregg and Tim's respective profiles, of which Gregg has completely devoted to the persona of his alter-ego. Heidecker and Turkington have also appeared in character on the podcasts ''Kreative Kontrol'' and ''[[Best Show]]'' in 2015 and 2017.

Heidecker and Turkington also started ''Decker-Con'', where new episodes of ''Decker'' are shown to fans and the cast appears as their "On Cinema" characters to field questions.&lt;ref name="fans"/&gt;

In 2013 the ''On Cinema Film Guide'' app was released, featuring the voices of Turkington and Heidecker reviewing over 17,000 films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wild |first=Matt |url=http://www.avclub.com/article/tim-heidecker-and-gregg-turkingtons-emon-cinemaem--97166 |title=Tim Heidecker and Gregg Turkington’s On Cinema is now a very meta app|publisher=Avclub.com |date=2013-04-30 |accessdate=2015-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For "The Trial", Heidecker and Turkington upended the traditional review aspect of the series, and staged an elaborate mock event where Tim's character was "on trial for murder" that lasted over a week. It received acclaim from observers, some of whom called it "brilliant" and "ambitious."&lt;ref name="mocktrial"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Tim Heidecker Is On Trial For Murder in Adult Swim's Latest Web Stunt"|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/11/tim-heidecker-is-on-trial-for-murder-in-adult-swim.html|publisher=''[[Paste Magazine]]''|date=8 November 2017|author=Jim Vorel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="denofgeekoc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Adult Swim’s On Cinema Has Become A Murder Trial|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/tv/on-cinema/269227/adult-swim-s-on-cinema-has-become-a-murder-trial|publisher=''[[Den of Geek]]''|date=25 November 2017|author=Daniel Kurland}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Spin"&gt;{{cite web|title=Adult Swim Is Broadcasting a Multi-Day Fake Murder Trial for Tim Heidecker|url=https://www.spin.com/2017/11/on-cinema-tim-heidecker-murder-trial|publisher=[[Spin Magazine]]|date= November 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Touring ==
In 2018, Heidecker and Turkington initiated a nationwide ''On Cinema Live!'' tour with special guests from the On Cinema/Decker universe such as [[Joe Estevez]], the band ''Dekkar'' and special content created only for the tour, such as a live reviewing of all mid-2018 major release films: [[Superfly (2018 film)|''Superfly'']], ''[[Mission Impossible: Fallout]]'', ''[[Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom]]'', ''[[Sicario 2: Soldado]]'', ''[[Ant Man &amp; The Wasp]]''.&lt;ref name="Barsanti"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Naftule"/&gt;&lt;ref name="portlandmercury.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="consequenceofsound.net"/&gt;

'''''Orange Is the New Black: My Year in a Women's Prison''''' (titled '''''Orange Is the New Black: My Time in a Women's Prison''''' in some editions) is a 2010 memoir by [[Piper Kerman]], which tells the story of her [[money laundering]] and [[illegal drug trade|drug trafficking]] conviction and subsequent year spent in a [[Federal Bureau of Prisons|federal]] [[Incarceration of women in the United States|women's prison]].&lt;ref name="nymag1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Humphrey |first=Michael |url=http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2010/03/piper_kerman.html |title=Ex-Convict Piper Kerman on Her Hot New Memoir, Orange Is the New Black |publisher=[[New York (magazine)|New York Magazine]] |date=March 25, 2010 |accessdate=May 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was adapted into the [[Netflix]] original comedy-drama series ''[[Orange Is the New Black]]''.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Prison Life, Real and Onscreen|first=Aimee|last=Lee Ball|date=August 2, 2013|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/04/fashion/prison-life-real-and-onscreen.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

The memoir details the events which occur as a result of Piper Kerman's involvement with Nora Jansen, a former friend, lover and drug smuggler.  In 1993, shortly after her graduation from [[Smith College]], Kerman agreed to accompany Jansen on several trips to Asia and Europe, going as far as carrying a suitcase of laundered money across the Atlantic Ocean before returning to San Francisco to "piece her life back together".  In May 1998, Kerman was visited by two Customs agents, and six years later she was sentenced to 15 months in federal prison.  After serving time in three different facilities ([[FCI Danbury]], [[Federal Transfer Center, Oklahoma City|FTC Oklahoma City]], and [[MCC Chicago]]), Kerman was released in March 2005.

==Reception==
{{expand section|date=July 2014}}
Sasha Abramsky of the ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'' stated that the book "documents the author’s attempts to preserve her individuality in the face of a gray, impersonal bureaucracy—one {{sic|based |hide=y|around}} prisoner counts, strip searches, rules governing the minutiae of life, and continual reminders that prisoners, by definition, have no power, no real autonomy."&lt;ref name=Abramskyp3&gt;Abramsky, Sasha. "American Justice." ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'', May–June, 2010, Vol.49(1), p.55(3) [Peer Reviewed Journal]. Online: May 1, 2010. Online [http://www.cjr.org/review/american_justice.php?page=3  p. 3]. ([https://www.webcitation.org/6QvhMKV0l Archive]). Retrieved on July 9, 2014. "The juxtaposition between Texas Tough and Orange Is the New Black is fascinating, and makes them well worth reading together."&lt;/ref&gt; Abramsky wrote that the book is mostly "a journey of self-discovery, describing how one can find one’s true strengths during moments of adversity" and that it "is more similar to South African anti-apartheid activist [[Albie Sachs]]'s ''Jail Diary'' than it is to, say, [[Mumia Abu-Jamal]]’s denunciatory communiqués from Pennsylvania’s death row."&lt;ref name=Abramskyp2&gt;{{cite news|author=Abramsky, Sasha|title=American Justice|work=[[Columbia Journalism Review]]|date= May–June 2010|volume=49|number=1|pages=55(3)|url=http://www.cjr.org/review/american_justice.php?page=2  | accessdate=July 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her review for ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', Jessica Grose argued that the book is not an examination of women within prison but rather a member of the middle-class-transgression genre, in which women from higher level social classes go into situations which are considered degrading. She said that the book should have included Kerman's insight into her own behavior and "A bit of this moral ambiguity would have helped Kerman's memoir a whole lot."&lt;ref name=Grose&gt;Grose, Jessica. "[http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2010/04/whats_a_nice_blonde_like_me_doing_in_prison.single.html What's a Nice Blonde Like Me Doing in Prison?]" ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''. April 8, 2010. Retrieved on April 10, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; June Thomas, also from ''Slate'', cited Grose's review and stated that, "Ultimately, though, the book feels like a well-written, readable stage in Kerman’s rehabilitation."&lt;ref name=ThomasSlate&gt;Thomas, June. "[http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2013/07/22/orange_is_the_new_black_netflix_tv_show_is_better_than_the_piper_kerman.html How ''Orange Is the New Black'' Improves on the Book]." ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''. July 22, 2013. Retrieved on April 10, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas stated that the television show had improved on the book by expanding on Kerman's descriptions of real people and turning them into compelling fictional characters.&lt;ref name=ThomasSlate/&gt;

Writing in the ''[[Journal-Advocate]]'', Tricia Ketchum called the book "not your typical 'I survived prison memoir', referring to Kerman as "spoiled" as she received multiple care packages and money into her commissary.&lt;ref name=Ketchum&gt;{{cite news| title =Memoir details woman's year in prison | work =Tricia Ketchum | publisher =Journal-Advocate | date =3 May 2016 | url =http://www.journal-advocate.com/entertainment/ci_29597205/memoir-details-womans-year-prison-orange-is-new-black-piper-kerman }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ketchum concludes, "The best part of this book is the message that it leaves you with: No matter what choices you make, you never realize just how much they will impact the lives of those around you until it is too late."&lt;ref name=Ketchum /&gt;

The book was selected by the [[UC Santa Barbara]] Library as its 2015 book for the university-wide reading program "UCSB Reads".&lt;ref name="estrada"&gt;{{cite web|last=Estrada |first=Andrea |url=http://www.news.ucsb.edu/2014/014620/ucsb-reads-selects-orange-new-black-piper-kerman#sthash.f8D878jO.dpuf |title='UCSB Reads’ Selects ‘Orange Is the New Black’ by Piper Kerman |publisher=The UC Santa Barbara Current |date=November 24, 2014 |accessdate=Jan 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These winners were not required to paint scenes from Asia, which they had usually not visited prior to winning the prize. For example, [[Henri Dabadie]], having travelled at his own expenses in Algeria, without having won the coveted Prix Abd-el-Tif for a residence at the [[Villa Abd-el-Tif]], entered a painting of the Bay of Tunis into competition at the Salon de la Société coloniale des Artistes français in 1928, which won him the Prix de l'Indochine, including free passage to Indochina, and a period of employment at EBAI in Hanoi.&lt;ref name=Indochine&gt;André-Pallois, Nadine.

==Early life==
Butler was born in [[Granite City, Illinois|Granite City]], Illinois, to Robert Olen Butler Sr., an actor and theater professor who became the chairman of the theater department of [[Saint Louis University]], and his wife, the former Lucille Frances Hall, an executive secretary.&lt;ref&gt;

Butler attended [[Northwestern University]] as a theater major ([[Bachelor of Science|BS]], 1967) and switched to [[Playwright|playwriting]] at the [[University of Iowa]] ([[Master of Arts|MA]], 1969).

Butler served in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] from 1969 to 1971, first as a [[counter-intelligence]] special agent for the [[United States Army|Army]] and later as a translator. He rose to the rank of [[Sergeant#United States|sergeant]] in the Army [[Military Intelligence Corps]]. His experiences during that period have informed his writings, and as a result, in 1987 Butler received the Tu Do Chinh Kien Award from the [[Vietnam Veterans of America]] for outstanding contributions to American culture by a veteran. "My greatest pleasure in life was at 2 in the morning to wander out into the steamy back alleys of [[Ho Chi Minh City|Saigon]], where nobody ever seemed to sleep, and just walk the alleys and crouch in the doorways with the people," Butler told ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 1993. "The Vietnamese were the warmest, most open and welcoming people I've ever met, and they just invited me into their homes and into their culture and into their lives."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Applebome, "An Author Catapulted into the Foreground," ''The New York Times'', April 20, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

After working as a steel mill laborer, a taxi driver, and a substitute teacher in high schools in the years following his tour of duty in Vietnam, Butler joined [[Fairchild Publications]], where he worked on the staffs of trade publications such as ''Electronic News''. From 1975 until 1985, he was the editor-in-chief of Fairchild's ''Energy User News'' (now ''Energy &amp; Power Management'').&lt;ref&gt;It is now a publication of [[BNP Media]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary career==
Robert Olen Butler is the author of 12 novels and six short story collections, including ''A Good Scent from a Strange Mountain'', which won the 1993 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. In a review for the ''Guardian'' newspaper, renowned author Claire Messud wrote, "The book has attracted such acclaim not simply because it is beautifully and powerfully written, but because it convincingly pulls off an immense imaginative risk. . . . Butler has not entered the significant and ever-growing canon of Vietnam-related fiction (he has long been a member)—he has changed its composition forever."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Messud|first=Claire|title=Voices of Vietnam|newspaper=Guardian (London)|date=June 9, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Butler began writing novels on the Long Island Railroad while working as a publicist for Fairchild Publications. "Every word of my first four published novels was written on a legal pad, by hand, on my lap, on the [[Long Island Rail Road]] as I commuted back and forth from [[Sea Cliff, New York|Sea Cliff]] to [[Manhattan]]," Butler has said about his early writing.&lt;ref name=Powells&gt;

The author's first novel was ''[[The Alleys of Eden]]'', which was published in 1981 by Horizon Press after being rejected by 21 publishers.&lt;ref name=Powells/&gt; Its protagonist is an American deserter who decides to stay in Vietnam, as Butler's one-time writing professor [[Anatole Broyard]] wrote in ''The New York Times'', "because, with all its troubles, Vietnam seems to him to retain more of its integrity, its sense of self, than the America he has left behind."&lt;ref name=TimesReview&gt;

Prior to the publication of ''The Alleys of Eden'', Butler had written, by his estimation, "five ghastly novels, about forty dreadful short stories, and twelve truly awful full-length plays, all of which have never seen the light of day and never will."&lt;ref name=Powells/&gt;

Butler has always been a controversial artist, seemingly reinventing himself with each new novel or short story collection. His shape-shifting often polarizes reviewers, as was the case with Butler's second novel ''Sun Dogs'' (Horizon, 1983), which ''The New York Times'' described as having "some powerful moments, some engrossing scenes and deft touches, but there is little momentum, no satisfying pattern, none of the magic of synergy."&lt;ref name=TimesReview/&gt; Conversely, the ''Ft. Worth Star-Telegram'' lauded the book as "full of power and energy...mov[ing] from the most feverish of prose to a flatness and sparseness that is reminiscent of the best of Chandler and Hammett. And most importantly, he has something to say... Butler is an intelligent novelist who cares about his characters. He is skillful enough to make the reader feel the same way. It is not often that we get the chance to witness the birth of something this important."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Reed|first=Ronald|title=Now See What He's Done for an Encore|newspaper=Ft. Worth Star-Telegram|date=November 14, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Butler's stories have appeared in such publications as ''[[The New Yorker]]'', ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harper's]]'', ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'', ''[[GQ (magazine)|GQ]]'', and ''[[Zoetrope: All-Story]]''. He has had stories included in a combined twelve editions of ''[[Best American Short Stories|The Best American Short Stories]]'', ''[[New Stories From the South]]'', and numerous college literature textbooks. Butler has also written screenplays for film and television, most of them based on other writers' material.&lt;ref&gt;

Butler's short-story collections ''Tabloid Dreams'' (1996) and ''Had a Good Time'' (2004) take their inspiration from popular culture. The stories in ''Tabloid Dreams'' were spun from the titles of outlandish articles in supermarket tabloids. ''Had a Good Time'' builds its narratives around the images on vintage American picture postcards, which Butler has collected for more than a decade. One example is the tale "Mother in the Trenches", first published in ''Harper's'' in February 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Butler. {{cite web|url= http://www.harpers.org/archive/2003/02/0079484|date=February 2003|accessdate= 2007-08-04|title= Mother in the Trenches|work= Harper's Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; It traces the journey of Mrs. Jack Gaines, a prosperous matron, from her comfortable home to the battlefields of [[World War I]] France, in order to convince her soldier son to come home; the story's basis is a period postcard that depicts a stout, middle-aged woman wearing dark clothes and a cloche hat.

Again the critical response varied dramatically. While the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' said that the stories "feel like a literary parlor game,"&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, John. {{cite news|url= http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/a/2004/08/22/RVGH889K2R1.DTL|date= August 22, 2004|accessdate= 2007-08-04|title= Faces look out from postcards to inspire stories|work= The San Francisco Chronicle | first=John | last=Freeman}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Boston Globe'' raved that it was full of "crisp writing, marvelous imagining, the discussion of large, existential questions that are as central to life now as they were a hundred years ago."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Merullo|first=Roland|title=A Past's Captured Souls|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=August 22, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Severance,'' his 2006 collection of 240-word short stories about the post-beheading thoughts of decapitated individuals (from [[Nicole Brown Simpson]] to [[Louis XVI]] to the author himself) was the basis of ''Severance'', a one-act play by [[David Jette]]. It was produced in 2007 at McCadden Place Theatre in Los Angeles. At the time, Butler described ''Severance'' as his best and most ambitious book.&lt;ref&gt;

This was the first of an extended venture into defining and exploring the short short story form.  His companion collection, ''Intercourse'', comprising 100 very short stories, revealed the inner monologues of couples (often famous) engaged in sexual intercourse. ''Weegee Stories,'' presenting the inner monologues of the subjects of 60 iconic photographs of Arthur "Weegee" Fellig, continued his interest in the form.  He also published a theory of the short short story in ''[[Narrative Magazine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Butler|first=Robert Olen|title=A Short Short Theory|url=http://www.narrativemagazine.com/issues/spring-2009/short-short-theory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As further evidence of his predilection for self-reinvention, in 2009 he published ''Hell'', a "roaring satire"&lt;ref name="Seaman"&gt;{{cite news|last=Seaman|first=Donna|title=Review|newspaper=Booklist|date=March 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a novel set entirely in the underworld. His 2011 novel, ''A Small Hotel'', is described by Donna Seaman of ''Booklist'', the American Library Association's magazine, as a "sexy novel of psychological suspense."  She goes on to say, "Butler executes a plot twist of profound proportions in this gorgeously controlled, unnerving, and beautifully revealing tale of the consequences of emotional withholding."&lt;ref name="Seaman"/&gt;

In still another act of reinvention, Butler publishes his first literary/historical/espionage/thriller, ''The Hot Country'', with Otto Penzler's ''[[Mysterious Press]]'' in the fall of 2012.

In 2001, Butler wrote in real-time, a complete short story, "This is Earl Sandt," from first inspiration to final story, in a webcast of 17 two-hour sessions. As the author explained of the broadcasts, "What we're trying to do here is reproduce for you what is normally hidden behind the veil of private life.".&lt;ref&gt;

Butler taught creative writing from 1985 to 2000&lt;!-- Not positive about this year--may be 2001. --&gt; at [[McNeese State University]] in [[Lake Charles, Louisiana]], with his colleague [[John Wood (poet)|John Wood]], to whom he dedicated ''[[A Good Scent from a Strange Mountain]]''. He then joined the faculty of [[Florida State University]] as a Francis Eppes Distinguished Professor, holding the [[Michael Shaara]] Chair in Creative Writing, where he currently teaches.

==Awards and honors==
Butler is a recipient of a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in fiction and a [[National Endowment for the Arts]] grant, and was a finalist for the [[PEN/Faulkner Award]]. In 2001 he won a [[National Magazine Award]] for "Fair Warning," a short story that was published in the journal ''Zoetrope: All-Story'', and, four years later, he won another National Magazine Award for "The One in White," a short story published in ''The Atlantic Monthly''.

In 1993, his first story collection, ''[[A Good Scent from a Strange Mountain]]'', won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for fiction. ''The New York Times'' praised the book's "startling, dreamlike"&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:HP garage front.JPG|thumb|David Packard's garage in Palo Alto, in which Packard and Bill Hewlett first founded their company.]]

The '''rules of the garage''' are a set of eleven rules that attempt to encapsulate the work ethos that [[William Redington Hewlett|Bill Hewlett]] and [[David Packard]] when they founded [[Hewlett-Packard]]. Since Hewlett-Packard was one of the earliest success stories of the information technology sector, it also used to more broadly describe the work ethos of [[Silicon Valley]].

== Etymology ==
The Rules were first articulated in 1999 by then HP CEO Carly Fiorina - during her tenure as then HP CEO - and they were later used in a Hewlett-Packard ad campaign.&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/2009/01/rules-of-the-ga/ |title=Rules of the Garage, And Then Some |work=Wired |first=John C |last=Abell |date=January 3, 2009 |accessdate=May 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name was a reference to [[HP Garage|David Packard's garage]] in Palo Alto, in which Packard and Bill Hewlett first founded the company after graduating from nearby [[Stanford University]] in 1935.&lt;ref name="isbn1-59184-152-6"&gt;{{cite book |title=Bill &amp; Dave: How Hewlett and Packard Built the World's Greatest Company |publisher=Portfolio |location=New York |first=Michael S |last=Malone |year=2007 |pages=39–41 |isbn=1-59184-152-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Eleven "Rules of the Garage" ==
The eleven rules are:&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt;
# Believe you can change the world.
# Work quickly, keep the tools unlocked, work whenever.
# Know when to work alone and when to work together.
# Share — tools, ideas. Trust your colleagues.
# No Politics. No bureaucracy. (These are ridiculous in a garage.)
# The customer defines a job well done.
# Radical ideas are not bad ideas.
# Invent different ways of working.
# Make a contribution every day. If it doesn’t contribute, it doesn’t leave the garage.
# Believe that together we can do anything.
# Invent.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4808">'''Scottish orientalism''' refers to the collective views of a group of [[Scottish people|Scottish]] scholars of [[oriental languages]], informed by the [[Scottish Enlightenment]], and applied to the culture and administration of the [[Indian subcontinent]] though the [[East India Company]], from the end of the 18th century to the middle of the 19th century.

The word "orientalist" is recorded in English from 1779. In its early days and in relation to [[India]] (rather than the Ottoman possessions) it connoted not only proficiency in languages of India, but also study of the culture, and advocacy of administration of the existing legal systems and customs. This attitude was opposed by both [[evangelical]] and [[Utilitarian]] critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Robert Irwin (writer)|Robert Irwin]] |title=For Lust of Knowing: The Orientalists and their Enemies |year=2006 |publisher=Allen Lane |isbn=0-713-99415-0 |pages=159–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Scottish dominance within [[Orientalism#British_Orientalism|British orientalism]] at the end of the 18th century—the period after the death of [[Sir William Jones]] in 1794—was almost complete: the only leading exception was [[Henry Thomas Colebrooke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Theodore Koditschek|title=Liberalism, Imperialism, and the Historical Imagination|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=heOq2CIzEtAC&amp;pg=PA66|accessdate=3 March 2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-49488-5|page=66 note 19.}} Others mentioned there are: [[Neil Benjamin Edmonstone]]; [[John Gilchrist (linguist)|John Gilchrist]]; [[William Hunter (Asiatic Society)|William Hunter]]; James Kirkpatrick; William Kirkpatrick; [[Colin Mackenzie]]; and [[Thomas Munro]]. [[Mark Wilks]] was from the [[Isle of Man]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rendall's theory==
Rendall has identified a group of Scottish oriental scholars, under the influence of [[Dugald Stewart]] and his view of "philosophical history". They bridge the gap between [[William Robertson (historian)|William Robertson]] who warned of the [[ethnocentrism]] into which the approach of [[stadial history]] could betray Europeans, and [[James Mill]] who in ''[[The History of British India]]'' embraced the assumption of European superiority, in the case of [[Hindu culture]]. These men all had contact with [[Edinburgh University]], and comprise:&lt;ref&gt;Rendall, pp. 44–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[William Erskine (historian)|William Erskine]]
*[[Alexander Hamilton (linguist)|Alexander Hamilton]]
*[[Vans Kennedy]]
*[[John Leyden]]
*[[James Mackintosh]].
*[[Alexander Hamilton (linguist)|Alexander Murray]]

==Orientalism in government==
Michael Fry has argued that there was a "Scottish orientalist regime", including Elphinstone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Avril Ann Powell|title=Scottish Orientalists and India: The Muir Brothers, Religion, Education and Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KOnS1X8a528C&amp;pg=PA7|accessdate=5 March 2013|date=21 October 2010|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer|isbn=978-1-84383-579-0|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The views of Scottish administrators derived from the contemporary [[Moderate Party (Scotland)|Moderate]] church party, and Scottish intellectuals including Robertson and [[Adam Ferguson]], leading to an accepting line on Indian custom and culture.&lt;ref&gt;Constable, p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literature==
Strong sympathy for Indians was shown in the 1796 novel ''Translations of the Letters of a Hindoo Rajah'' (1796) by [[Elizabeth Hamilton (writer)|Elizabeth Hamilton]], sister of the orientalist [[Charles Hamilton (orientalist)|Charles Hamilton]]. The family was [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian Brown|title=The Edinburgh History of Scottish Literature: Enlightenment, Britain And Empire( 1707-1918)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BasUT5FyhM8C&amp;pg=PA160|accessdate=3 March 2013|year=2007|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-0-7486-2481-2|page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Siobhán Cleary''' (born 1970) is an Irish composer. Her most successful compositions have been her orchestral works ''Alchemy'' and ''Cokaygne'' and her choral piece ''Theophilus Thistle and the Myth of Miss Muffett''. Her opera ''Vampirella'' was first performed in [[Dublin]] in March 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cmc.ie/features/siobhan-cleary-vampirella|title=Siobhán Cleary on her new opera 'Vampirella'|date=16 March 2017|website=cmc.ie|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journalofmusic.com/criticism/gothic-outsiders|title=Gothic Outsiders|website=The Journal of Music|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Born in [[Dublin]], Cleary started to compose from an early age, often writing pieces while she was supposed to be practising at the piano. When she began to study music at [[Maynooth University]], she was initially inspired by [[Luciano Berio]]'s ''[[Sinfonia (Berio)|Sinfonia]]'', and soon afterwards by the works of the Irish composer [[Gerald Barry (composer)|Gerald Barry]], the French [[Olivier Messiaen]] and the Hungarian [[György Ligeti]].&lt;ref name=it/&gt; She continued her studies at 
[[Queen's University Belfast]] and [[Trinity College, Dublin]]. In addition, she has followed courses in composition with the Italian composer [[Franco Donatoni]] and the Dutch [[Louis Andriessen]] and received private tuition from the American [[Tom Johnson (composer)|Tom Johnson]] and the South African [[Kevin Volans]]. Under the Italian composer [[Ennio Morricone]] and the American [[Don Brandon Ray]], she has also studied [[Film score|film scoring]].&lt;ref name=cmc&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cmc.ie/composers/siobhan-cleary|title=Siobhán Cleary|publisher=Contemporary Music Centre, Ireland|accessdate=28 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==

Inspired by the alchemists' ''Opus Alchymicum'' which describes how cheaper metals are transmuted into gold, Cleary's orchestral work ''Alchemy'' (2001) is, like the stages in the ''Opus'', presented in four parts: it evolves from the slow ''nigrendo'', the moderate ''albedo'', the strong ''citronatus'', and the burning ''rubedo''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/siobhancleary/alchemy-rte|title=Alchemy (RTE)|publisher=Soundcloud|accessdate=28 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The work was performed by the [[RTÉ National Symphony Orchestra]] in January 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cmc.ie/music/alchemy|title=Alchemy (2001)|publisher=Contemporary Music Centre, Ireland|accessdate=28 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her tone poem ''Cokaygne'' (2009), which, like ''Alchemy'', was commissioned by RTÉ for the National Symphony Orchestra, is based on a poem and old sources which evoke a land of extreme luxury and contentment.&lt;ref name=it&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/music/2.749/how-to-stay-composed-in-an-unsure-career-1.776943|title=How to stay composed in an unsure career|author=Dervan, Michael|work=The Irish Times|date=23 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The elaborately orchestrated piece was performed by the RTÉ National Symphony Orchestra in November 2009, [[Vladimir Altschuler]] conducting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cmc.ie/music/cokaygne|title=''Cockaygne''|publisher=Contemporary Music Centre, Ireland|accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was performed by the RTÉNSO once again in June 2016, this time under the baton of [[Alan Buribayev]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/music/changing-of-the-guard-at-rt%C3%A9-orchestras-presents-an-opportunity-1.2667193|title=Changing of the guard at RTÉ orchestras presents an opportunity|author=Dervan, Michael|work=The Irish Times|date=1 June 2016|accessdate=28 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cleary's choral work ''Theophilus Thistle and the Myth of Miss Muffett'' (2010), commissioned by the [[Cork International Choral Festival|Cork Choral Festival]] was first performed in April 2011 by [[Chamber Choir Ireland]] directed by [[Paul Hillier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cmc.ie/music/theophilus-thistle-myth-miss-muffett|title=Theophilus Thistle &amp; The Myth of Miss Muffett |publisher=Contemporary Music Centre, Ireland|accessdate=28 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The work is based on a series of tongue twisters and other strange combinations of words popular in various European languages and dialects, moving from Italy, through Germany and Spain, finishing in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/siobhancleary/theophilus-thistle-part-2|title=Theophilus Thistle Part 2|publisher=Soundcloud|accessdate=29 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, it was performed twice by Chamber Choir Ireland in Dublin and Cork in connection with Ireland's presidency of the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.chamberchoirireland.com/events/a-eurocry/|title=A Eurocry|publisher=Chamber Choir Ireland|accessdate=29 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The journalist and music critic Terry Blain commented on the choir's "dazzingly virtuosic performance" in Belfast in 2013, qualifying the piece as "a tour de force of 21st century vocal chicanery, a clever and richly entertaining composition".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culturenorthernireland.org/reviews/music/love-other-nonsense|title=Love &amp; Other Nonsense|publisher=Culture Northern Ireland|accessdate=29 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Theophilus Thistle'' was also performed the same year in the United States as part of the "Imagine Ireland" festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imagineireland.ie/imagine-ireland-programme-330/|title=Imagine Ireland Programme|publisher=Imagine Ireland|accessdate=29 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chamber opera ''Vampirella'' with a libretto by Katy Hayes was first performed by students from the [[Royal Irish Academy of Music]] and the [[Trinity College, Dublin|Lir National Academy of Dramatic Art]] at Dublin's [[Smock Alley Theatre]] in March 2017. Based on a short story by [[Angela Carter]] telling how a young English soldier is seduced by a vampire countess, it was directed by Conor Hanratty and conducted by Andrew Synnott.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riam.ie/opera/|title=Vampirella|publisher=RIAM Royal Irish Academy of Music|accessdate=29 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Dervan of ''[[The Irish Times]]'' found the electronic sounds in the score particularly effective, commenting: "Perhaps this is a case of a genuinely electronic opera trying to break out of a more conventional mold."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/music/nymphs-shepherds-and-monsters-in-a-rural-irish-bar-1.3026521|title=Vampire seduction|author=Dervan, Michael|work=The Irish Times|date=29 March 2017|accessdate=29 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In 1996, Cleary received a young artists award from ''Pépinières européennes pour jeunes artistes'', followed in 1997 by the first prize in the Arklow Music Festival Composers' Competition.&lt;ref name=cmc/&gt; In 2008, she was invited to become a member of [[Aosdána]], an Irish association of creative artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aosdana.artscouncil.ie/Members/Music/Cleary.aspx|title=Siobhán Cleary|publisher=Aosdána|accessdate=29 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1153">'''Soros Realism''' is a term coined by [[Miško Šuvaković]] in "Ideologija izložbe: o ideologijama Manifeste" (2002) describing a type of [[post-socialist art]] financed by American Businessman of Hungarian origin [[George Soros]], who has financed number of Soros centers for contemporary art the Eastern Europe.

Although it was not originally used pejoratively by Šuvaković, because of its reverberation of the very name of [[Socialist Realism|Socialistic Realism]], a style of socialist propaganda in painting and sculpture, it has staid an irony of a renewed political funding of art, that censors by financing not forbidding.

'''Tarja''' (তর্জা) is a form of folk poetry contest from [[Bengal]] with a long tradition. Historically it used to be performed in the village gathering around a [[chandimandap]] or altar for village god, [[mela]] and other social events, in streets, and marketplace religious festivals. The themes of the contest are usually taken from [[Ramayana]], [[Mahabharata]] or [[Puranas]] the poets sings his/her part in the form of [[doggerels]] and the other participant has to guess the meaning of it. During the rising [[bhadralok]] population of the [[Bengal renaissance]] many of these clubs as well as jhumur clubs had been destroyed &lt;ref name=History&gt;''Recasting Women:Essays in Colonial History'', Kumkum Sangari et al. , page 157&lt;/ref&gt; on the basis of its [[obscene]] content.

An example of a tarja couplet will be like:&lt;blockquote&gt;
Maagi minsheke chit kore fele diye buke diyechhe paa &lt;br&gt;
Aar chokhta kare jhulur jhulur, mukhe neiko raa&lt;ref name=History/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

This literally translates as "the hussy has thrown the bloke flat on his back, with her foot on his chest/ wordless she stands glaring in anger".&lt;ref name=History/&gt; The answer to this puzzle will be the goddess [[Kali]] and the legend connected to her. The answerer to this will also sing out his/her answer in a poem made at that instant of time.

== As an art form==
The music grown out of this poetry contest has a particular flavour in it. It is also highly conntected to the other similar forms like [[jhumur]], [[tappa]] and has contributed to a degree to the music of [[Bengal]].

'''''The Bridge at Narni''''' (in French: ''Le pont de Narni'') is an 1826 painting of the [[Ponte d'Augusto (Narni)|Ponte d'Augusto]] at [[Narni]] by [[France|French]] artist [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]]. The painting is currently on display at the [[Musée du Louvre]] in [[Paris]]. 

The painting is a product of one of Corot's youthful sojourns in Italy, and, in [[Kenneth Clark]]'s words, "as free as the most vigorous [[John Constable|Constable]]". It was painted in September 1826, and was the basis for the larger and more finished ''View at Narni'', which was exhibited at the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] of 1827, and is now in the [[National Gallery of Canada]], [[Ottawa]].

The view was not a novel one: in 1821 Corot's teacher, [[Achille-Etna Michallon]] had drawn the same scene, as had Corot's friend Ernst Fries in 1826. Corot's study is a reconciliation of traditional and [[plein air]] painting objectives:

''So deeply did Corot admire [[Claude Lorrain|Claude]] and [[Nicholas Poussin|Poussin]], so fully did he understand their work, that from the outset he viewed nature in their terms....In less than a year (since his arrival in Rome) he had realized his goal of closing the gap between the empirical freshness of outdoor painting and the organizing principles of classical landscape composition.''&lt;ref&gt;Galassi, Peter, ''Corot in Italy'', page 168-70. Yale University Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
(in the original French ''Dialogue aux enfers entre Machiavel et Montesquieu ou la politique de Machiavel au XIXe siècle'') is a [[political satire]] written by French [[lawyer|attorney]] [[Maurice Joly]] in protest against the regime of [[Napoleon III]], a.k.a. Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte who ruled France from 1848-1870.  It was translated into English in 2002.  Small portions were translated in 1967 as an appendix to [[Norman Cohn|Norman Cohn's]] ''[[Warrant for Genocide]]'', which identifies it as the main source of the later ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion|Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]''.

The piece uses the literary device of a dialogue of the dead, invented by ancient Roman writer [[Lucian]] and introduced into the French [[belles-lettres]] by [[Bernard de Fontenelle]] in the 18th century. Shadows of the historical characters of [[Niccolo Machiavelli]] and [[Charles Montesquieu]] meet in Hell in the year 1864 and dispute on politics. In this way Joly tried to cover up a direct, and then illegal, criticism of Louis-Napoleon's rule.

==Summary==

[[File:M. Joly. Dialogue aux enfers. Title page, 1864.jpeg|thumb|&lt;div align="center"&gt;Dialogue aux enfers, 1864&lt;/div&gt;]]
Joly relates in his 1870 autobiography

&lt;/ref&gt;
and walking by [[Pont Royal]], he was inspired to write a dialogue between Montesquieu and Machiavelli. The noble baron Montesquieu would make the case for [[liberalism]]; the Florentine politician Machiavelli would present the case for [[despotism]].

Machiavelli claims that he "... wouldn't even need twenty years to transform utterly the most indomitable European character and render it as a docile under tyranny as the debased people of Asia". Montesquieu insists that the liberal spirit of the peoples is invincible. In 25 dialogues, step by step, Machiavelli, who by Joly's plot covertly represents Napoleon III, explains how he would replace freedom with despotism in any given European country: "... Absolute power will no longer be an accident of fortune but will become a need" of the modern society. At the end, Machiavelli prevails. In the curtain-line Montesquieu exclaims "Eternal God, what have you permitted!...".
&lt;ref name="Waggoner" /&gt;

The book was published anonymously (par un contemporain, ''by a contemporary'') in [[Brussels]] in 1864
&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and smuggled into France for distribution, but the print run was seized by the police immediately upon crossing the border. The police swiftly tracked down its author, and Joly was arrested.  The book was banned.  On 25 April 1865, he was sentenced to 18 months at the [[Sainte-Pélagie Prison]] in Paris. The second edition of "Dialogues" was issued in 1868 under Joly's name

{{More citations needed|date=March 2018}}The Washington Color School was a movement starting in Washington DC, built of six core abstract expressionist artists during the 1950s–1970s. They emerged during a time when society, the arts, and people were changing quickly. The inner circle of this new visual art movement consisted of Kenneth Noland, Morris Louis, Gene Davis, Howard Mehring, Tom Downing, and Paul Reed.
The '''Washington Color School''', a visual art movement describes a form of image making concerned primarily with [[color field painting]], a form of non-objective or non-representational art that explored ways to use large solid areas of paint. The Washington Color School originally consisted of a group of painters who showed works in an exhibit called the "Washington Color Painters" at the now-defunct [[Washington Gallery of Modern Art]] in Washington from June 25 to September 5, 1965.  The exhibition's organizer was Gerald "Gerry" Nordland and the painters who exhibited were [[Sam Francis]], [[Sam Gilliam]],( painter) [[Gene Davis (painter)|Gene Davis]], [[Morris Louis]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Howard Mehring]],  [[Thomas "Tom" Downing]], and [[Paul Reed (artist)|Paul Reed]]. This exhibition, which subsequently traveled to several other venues in the United States, including the [[Walker Art Center]], solidified Washington's place in the national movement and defined what is considered the city's signature art movement, according to art historians and journalists alike. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/museums/when-the-washington-color-school-earned-its-stripes-on-the-national-stage/2015/06/26/83413b9e-0f98-11e5-9726-49d6fa26a8c6_story.html|title &lt;/ref&gt;When the Washington Color School earned its stripes on the national stage.

The Washington Color School artists painted largely non-representational works, and were central to the larger [[color field]] movement.{{According to whom|date=January 2016}} Though not generally considered [[abstract expressionism|abstract expressionists]] due to the orderliness of their works and differing motivating philosophies, many parallels can be drawn between the Washington Color School and the abstract expressionists. Minimally, the use of stripes, washes, and fields of single colors of paint on canvas were common to most artists in both groups. A common technique used in the Washington Color School was "soak staining" or just "staining", where one would pour a thinned painting medium onto canvas and let it sit over time. The result would be a stain in the canvas with no visible traces of conventional application, such as brush strokes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ideelart.com/module/csblog/post/203-1-art-techniques.html|title=The Most Typical Abstract Art Techniques|website=IdeelArt|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330052444/http://www.ideelart.com/module/csblog/post/203-1-art-techniques.html|archive-date=March 30, 2018|dead-url=|access-date=March 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After their initial benchmark exhibition, Davis, Mehring, and Reed were joined by Timothy Corkery, Willem de Looper and Jacob Kainen at The Seventeenth Area Exhibition of Artists of Washington and the Adjacent Area at The Corcoran Gallery of Art from November 12 to December 19,1965. The Eighteenth Area Exhibition at The Corcoran from November 18 to December 31,1967 again featured artists including de Looper, Corkery, Downing, Gilliam and Kainen.

Many of these artists exhibited at the Jefferson Place Gallery originally directed by [[Alice Denney]] and later owned and directed by Nesta Dorrance /Sept 21,1969 Washington Post Dorrance/) Other artists associated with the group include: [[Anne Truitt]], [[Mary Pinchot Meyer]], Leon Berkowitz,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washington.org/colorfieldremix/aboutwcs.cfm], retrieved June 4, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jacob Kainen]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/23/arts/jacob-kainen-91-painter-and-print-curator.html], ''NY Times'' Obituary, retrieved June 4, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alma Thomas]], James Hilleary,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/james-hilleary-noted-washington-artist-dies-at-90/2014/04/22/22d0ae00-c72a-11e3-9f37-7ce307c56815_story.html], retrieved May 21, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and others. The group is sometimes thought to have expanded as it achieved a dominant presence in the Washington, D.C. visual art community through the 1960s into the 1970s. Along with the original Washington Color School painters, a second generation also exhibited at Jefferson Place Gallery.(6/69 “Four Minds With It” Wash Star; Benjamin) those artists remained influential even as some of its members dispersed elsewhere.

==Artists==
[[Hilda Thorpe]] (Hilda Shapiro Thorpe) was a color field painter who made oversized paintings and paper sculptures who taught a generation of artists in the Washington, D.C. area. Other Washington Color School female artists include [[Anne Truitt]] (whose work relates to the 'minimalist-purity' side of three-dimensional painterly objects and painters), [[Mary Pinchot Meyer]], and [[Alma Thomas]]. Other works that reflect the Washington Color School include [[Sam Gilliam]]'s suspended paintings (whose style can be described by some as [[Baroque painting|''Baroque'']]), Timothy Corkery’s sharp Arrows and contrasting diffuse architectural doorways. [[Rockne Krebs]]' transparent sculptures, light and laser works, Ed McGowin's vacuum-formed pieces which he was ending and moving towards a more personal art (tableau), Bill Christenberry's neon works, which led him to deal more directly with his roots, and the work of Bob Stackhouse and [[Tom Green (artist)|Tom Green]]. 

During spring and summer 2007, arts institutions in Washington, D.C. staged a citywide celebration of [[color field painting]], including exhibitions at galleries and museums of works by members of the Washington Color School.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/16/AR2007011601756.html], retrieved on May 21, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, a group of Washington art collectors began the Washington Color School Project, to gather and publish information about the history of the color painters and abstract art in Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtoncolorschool.com|title=Washington Color School Project|publisher=|accessdate=January 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though some of them were not born in Washington, they exhibited together representing Washington as a new hub for the visual arts.

'''Wright &amp; Wright Architects''' is a British architectural firm, founded in 1994 by Sandy and Clare Wright MBE. The firm is based in [[Camden Town]], London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrightandwright.co.uk/contact|title=Contact :: Wright &amp; Wright|website=www.wrightandwright.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:T01-Royal-College-of-Art-Masterplan.jpg|thumb|The Royal College of Art Library, London]]
The practice initially focused on housing projects, particularly for organisations that support people with special needs, such as the Aids and Housing Trust and the [[Joseph Rowntree Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://women-in-architecture.com/index.php?id=31&amp;tx_wiaprofiles_pi1%5Bprofile%5D=87&amp;tx_wiaprofiles_pi1%5Baction%5D=show&amp;tx_wiaprofiles_pi1%5Bcontroller%5D=Profile&amp;cHash=58560ee3c3a3051324e69425b8c033cd|title=women in architecture: DiverseCity profiles|website=women-in-architecture.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since winning a competition in 1995 to design the [[Royal College of Art|Royal College of Art's]] library in central London, Wright &amp; Wright have built up a portfolio of projects in higher education and cultural buildings, including the Longwall Library for [[Magdalen College, Oxford]] and the [[Women's Library]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.architectural-review.com/today/the-womens-library-by-wright-and-wright-london/8630113.article|title=The Women's Library by Wright &amp; Wright, London|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in London. Through this work the practice has developed a design expertise in archives, libraries and galleries, and has delivered projects for institutions such as the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] and the [[National Gallery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bdonline.co.uk/national-gallery-lower-galleries-by-wright-and-wright/5027485.article|title=National Gallery Lower Galleries by Wright &amp; Wright|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice is led by three partners: Clare Wright, Sandy Wright and Stephen Smith.

Clare Wright studied at the [[Mackintosh School of Architecture]] in Glasgow where she was tutored by [[Andy MacMillan]] and [[Isi Metzstein]]. She was the Design Manager at [[Circle Housing Group|Circle 33]] Housing Trust before co-founding Wright &amp; Wright. She was an [[RIBA]] Vice-President and sits on the English Heritage/ CABE Urban and Design Review Panels,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://historicengland.org.uk/about/who-we-are/committees-and-panels/urban-panel/|title=Urban Panel - Historic England|first=Historic|last=England|website=historicengland.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; responsible for advising [[CABE]] on [[Crossrail]]. She was awarded an [[MBE]] in 2005 for services to architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/home/birthday-honours-for-architects/138696.article|title=Birthday honours for architects|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sandy Wright studied at the [[Mackintosh School of Architecture]], where he was taught by [[Isi Metzstein]], whom he went on to work for at [[Gillespie, Kidd &amp; Coia]]. At Gillespie, Kidd &amp; Coia he worked on [[Robinson College, Cambridge|Robinson College in Cambridge]] and the library at [[Wadham College, Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsa.ac.uk/life/gsa-events/events/s/sandy-wright/?source=archive|title=Sandy Wright|first=|last=LynMclaughlin|website=www.gsa.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blue Boar Court at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] and work on [[Worcester College, Oxford]] were both undertaken while he was a partner at MacCormac Jamieson Prichard and Wright.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ribaj.com/culture/the-care-takers|title=Paywall Interstitial - RIBAJ|website=www.ribaj.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has tutored and lectured at over 20 schools of architecture in the UK, including at the [[Mackintosh School of Architecture]] and [[Newcastle University]], as well as being a competitions assessor for both the [[RIBA]] and the [[Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland|RIAS]].

The practice is currently working on nationally significant projects at [[Lambeth Palace]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/20/lambeth-palace-to-house-religious-library-new-nine-storey-tower|title=Lambeth Palace to get its first new building in 200 years|first=Harriet Sherwood Religion|last=correspondent|date=20 April 2017|publisher=|via=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Geffrye Museum]], London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geffrye-museum.org.uk/aboutus/press/releases/unlocking-the-geffrye/|title=£12.3m National Lottery grant to 'unlock' the Geffrye Museum - Geffrye UK|website=www.geffrye-museum.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ximena Escalante''' (born 1964) is a Mexican dramatist who is known for her works reinterpreting ancient Greek and other texts along with those examining the creative process of more modern writers. Born into a theatrical family in [[Mexico City]], she first wanted to be an actress but began writing when she was 16. All of her plays have been staged and most have been published both in Mexico and abroad. Her work has been translated into multiple languages and is regularly invited to events such as the HotInk, the Salon du Livre-Paris, the [[Miami International Book Fair]], the Festival Internacional del Libro in [[Guadalajara]] and at [[Banff Center for the Arts|The Banff Center]] and the Rockfeller Foundation.  In 2009, she was named an “artistic creator” with Mexico’s [[Sistema Nacional de Creadores de Arte|Sistema Nacional de Creadores]].

Because of her family’s theatrical background, she wanted to become an actress when she was very young, but was told that she did not have the talent for this.&lt;ref name=rbenitez/&gt; However, her upbringing in the upper-class Condesa neighborhood in Condesa shaped her perspective on human relations, having contact with artists and intellectuals and spend time at the movies with the children of [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]].&lt;ref name=ssierra&gt;{{cite news |author=Sonia Sierra |title= Ximena Escalante, "en el teatro siempre me siento sola" |newspaper= El Universal |location=Mexico City |date=July 26, 2006 |url= http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/cultura/49409.html |accessdate=March 16, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite this and the fact that she has written screenplays, she goes to the movies today infrequently.&lt;ref name=rbenitez/&gt;

At age 16 she began to write stories and novels and created her first play at that time. She entered a class taught by Hugo Argüelles and at the same time studied directing with Ludwick Margules. She then received a diploma from the Escuela de Escritores.&lt;ref name=rbenitez/&gt;&lt;ref name=lasvoces&gt;{{cite web |title=Las Voces del Teatro presenta a Ximena Escalante |publisher= INBA Coordinación Nacional de Literatura |date=2015 |url= http://www.literatura.bellasartes.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1613%3Alas-voces-del-teatro-presenta-a-ximena-escalante&amp;catid=121%3Aboletines&amp;Itemid=89 |accessdate=March 16, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hayuna&gt;{{cite press release |title= Hay una fascinación por la dramaturgia: Ximena Escalante |publisher= CONACULTA |location=Mexico |date=November 19, 2010 |url= http://www.conaculta.gob.mx/detalle-nota/?id=9582|accessdate=March 16, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She also took workshops with [[José Luis Alonso de Santos]], [[William Layton (actor)|William Layton]] and [[Juan José Gurrola]].&lt;ref name=enciclopedia/&gt;

She went to Spain to study her bachelors at the [[Real Escuela Superior de Arte Dramático]] (RESAD), majoring in writing and criticism, receiving scholarships from [[FONCA]], the Sistema Nacional de Creadores (Jóvenes Creadores) and the Spanish Ministry of Culture and Science.&lt;ref name=rbenitez/&gt;&lt;ref name=enciclopedia&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Enciclopedia de la literatura en México|title=Ximena Escalante|url=http://www.elem.mx/autor/datos/15199|accessdate=March 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then she has combined literature theory can criticism with her creative work.&lt;ref name=rbenitez/&gt;

Escalante has two children and her house in Mexico City is filled with momentos from her career and travels, such as photos of artists and posters from her plays.&lt;ref name=ssierra/&gt; When asked to describe herself she replied:
&lt;blockquote&gt; How am I? I am obsessed with ideas, with themes, with people: once have began with an obsession, I go where it takes me. I am very intense, too. I have taken many risks and I dont care. A sense of humor in myself and in others is important to me. I like food greatly. I don’t like people who do not appreciate eating. I am very sensual, I like pleasure and I share this with my friends and children. I am quite impatient and intolerant, and I like mariachi a lot. 
I try to lead a spiritual life. I spent many years studying Sufism. I life traveling because it allows me to see places, people, theaters, books, lovers and a wonderful world. I have a difficult personality, at the same time I need much love and sweetness. I have practiced Shaolinquan and I tend to be melancholy.
I have in me a strong struggle between my need to be alone and to be in the world. I spend many hours in fiction since my childhood and adolescence. Since childhood I have been this way. My brothers and sisters said and still say that I was autistic. Reality is not easy and I deal with it through paper and resolving things.&lt;ref name="ssierra" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Career==
Escalante says she is a slow writer and says only in the later career has she become more productive.&lt;ref name=rbenitez/&gt; However, almost all of her work has been published, and all of her plays have been staged.&lt;ref name=rbenitez/&gt; Her works have been translated into English, French, German, Greek, [[Dutch language|Dutch]], Italian and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and have been staged in New York, Washington, [[Ohio]], Miami, Montreal, [[Ottawa]], [[Banff, Alberta|Banff]], Paris, [[Lyon]], [[Cannes]], Venice, Rome, Amsterdam, [[Rotterdam]], [[Antwerp]], [[Udine]], Athens, [[Buenos Aires]], [[Santiago de Chile]] and [[Madrid]].&lt;ref name=casaoax&gt;{{cite web|title=Ximena Escalante |publisher=Centro de las Artes de San Agustin |location=Oaxaca |url=http://www.casa.oaxaca.gob.mx/index.php/convocatorias/89-nuevas/1028-dramaturgia-entre-el-teatro-y-el-guion-cinematografico-ximena-escalante |accessdate=March 16, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402174939/http://www.casa.oaxaca.gob.mx/index.php/convocatorias/89-nuevas/1028-dramaturgia-entre-el-teatro-y-el-guion-cinematografico-ximena-escalante |archivedate=April 2, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=worldtalent&gt;{{cite web|title=Ximena Escalante México |url=http://wth.com.mx/esp/ximena_escalante.html |publisher=World Talent House |accessdate=March 14, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402154129/http://wth.com.mx/esp/ximena_escalante.html |archivedate=April 2, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Mexico, her work has been directed by the likes of [[Mauricio García Lozano]] and Francisco Franco.&lt;ref name=cdominguez/&gt; Escalante worked with the Nouveau Théâtre du 8 theater company in [[Lyon, France]] from 2011 to 2013 to produce a series of four plays.&lt;ref name=casaoax/&gt;

The playwright has worked on various publications researched theatrical production and theory. She wrote a theater column for the newspaper Reforma from 2000 to 2006 and has written for publications associated with RESAD and UNAM.&lt;ref name=rbenitez/&gt;&lt;ref name=worldtalent/&gt;

Escalante has participated in various workshops in writing and theatrical production and gives classes in dramatic literature in various institutions.&lt;ref name=rbenitez/&gt; She runs a theater workshop open to all ages, with one of her students, Pablo Iván García, winning the Mexicali Fine Arts Prize in 2010, for his play Micro dermo abrasión.&lt;ref name=hayuna/&gt;

In 2009-2012 period, Escalante was named an “Artistic Creator” of the Sistema Nacional de Creadores.&lt;ref name=lasvoces/&gt;&lt;ref name=mamezcua/&gt; She has been invited on various occasions to the [[Pen Voices Festival]] in New York. Her works have been presented at HotInk, the Salon du Livre-Paris, the Miami International Book Fair, the Festival Internacional del Libro in Guadalajara, The Banff Center and at the Rockfeller Foundation.&lt;ref name=hayuna/&gt;&lt;ref name=casaoax/&gt;&lt;ref name=mamezcua&gt;{{cite news |author= Melissa Amezcua |title=Encanta su pluma en Francia|url=http://www.reforma.com/aplicacioneslibre/articulo/default.aspx?id=337326&amp;md5=9657c990ba54acd8c3b92b2e95e01bc4&amp;ta=0dfdbac11765226904c16cb9ad1b2efe|accessdate=March 14, 2015|newspaper=REFORMA|publisher=Gente|date= September 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistry==
While Escalante has written movie and television scripts including screenplays with Alfonso Arau and Rafael Montero,&lt;ref name=rbenitez/&gt;&lt;ref name=lasvoces/&gt; she has focused her career mostly on writing plays.&lt;ref name=cdominguez/&gt;

Much of Escalante’s work is based on classic myths and stories from the Classical Greece, (especially those of Sophocles, Aeschylus and Euripides) either reinterpreting them or working with characters and other elements, especially those she considers to be relevant to contemporary life.&lt;ref name=canal22&gt;{{cite web |title= Ximena Escalante utiliza en el teatro a la mitología para expresar el presente  |publisher= Canal 22  |location=Mexico City |url= https://www.canal22.org.mx/p/search_doc.php?ndf=2102 |accessdate=March 16, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lasvoces/&gt; Female characters such as [[Phaedra (mythology)|Phaedra]], [[Electra]], [[Andromache]], [[Salome]] and [[Lilith]] are often the focus.&lt;ref name=casaoax/&gt;

In addition to works based on ancient literature, Escalante has also created works dealing with the creative struggles of more modern writers, such as Shakespeare, [[Tennessee Williams]], [[Colette]], [[Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz]]. She even wrote one about painter [[Frida Kahlo]].&lt;ref name=casaoax/&gt;&lt;ref name=lasvoces/&gt;&lt;ref name=rbenitez/&gt;

In general Escalante’s works are tragedies which touch on love, passion and sexuality and the conflicts they generate. However, she does add touches of humor.&lt;ref name=rbenitez/&gt;&lt;ref name=lasvoces/&gt; Plays of this type include ''Fedra y otras griegas'' (2002), ''Colette'' (2005), ''Las relaciones (sexuales) de Shakespeare (y Marlowe)'' (2012) and ''Tennessee en cuerpo y alma'' (2012) .&lt;ref name=cdominguez/&gt; She believes it is inevitable to have plays be at least somewhat autobiographical.&lt;ref name=rreyes&gt;{{cite news |author=Rosario Reyes |title= Ximena Escalante, la escritora de sus propias vivencias |newspaper= El Financiero |location=Mexico City |date=May 21, 2014 |url= http://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/after-office/ximena-escalante-la-escritora-de-sus-propias-vivencias.html |accessdate=March 16, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GuanTongForgery.png|thumb|Chang Dai-chien's forgery of [[Guan Tong]]'s "Drinking and singing at the foot of a precipitous mountain" created between 1910 and 1957. Formerly attributed to Guan Tong, Chinese, 10th century. Ink and colours on silk. 218.2 x 90.2 cm]]

'''Zhang Daqian''' or '''Chang Dai-chien''' ({{zh|t=張大千|w='''Chang Ta-ch'ien'''}}; 10 May 1899 – 2 April 1983) was one of the best-known and most prodigious [[Chinese art]]ists of the twentieth century. Originally known as a ''[[guohua]]'' (traditionalist) painter, by the 1960s he was also renowned as a modern impressionist and expressionist painter. In addition, he is regarded as one of the most gifted master [[art forgery|forgers]] of the twentieth century.

==Background==
Zhang was born in 1899 in [[Sichuan]] Province to a financially struggling but artistic family. His first commission came at age 12, when a traveling fortune-teller requested he paint her a new set of divining cards. At age 17 he was captured by bandits while returning home from boarding school in Chongqing. When the bandit chief ordered him to write a letter home demanding a ransom, he was so impressed by the boy's brushmanship that he made the boy his personal secretary. During the more than three months that he was held captive, he read books of poetry which the bandits had looted from raided homes.&lt;ref name=Smithsonian&gt;{{''He was a Lion Among Painters'', Constance A. Bond, [[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]], January 1992, p. 90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a young adult Zhang moved to [[Kyoto, Japan|Kyoto]] to learn textile dyeing techniques. He later returned to [[Shanghai]] and established a successful career selling his paintings.

The governor of [[Qinghai]], [[Ma Bufang]], sent Zhang to [[Kumbum|Sku'bum]] to seek helpers for analyzing and copying [[Dunhuang]]'s Buddhist art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bLcWyecDpIcC&amp;pg=PA205|title=Amdo Tibetans in transition: society and culture in the post-Mao era: PIATS 2000: Tibetan studies: proceedings of the Ninth Seminar of the International Association for Tibetan Studies, Leiden 2000|author=Toni Huber|year=2002|publisher=BRILL|page=205|isbn=90-04-12596-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the [[Chinese Communist Revolution|political climate of China in 1949]], he left the country and resided in [[Mendoza, Argentina]], [[São Paulo]] and [[Mogi das Cruzes]], [[Brazil]], and then to [[Carmel, California]], before settling in [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]] in 1978.&lt;ref name=Brit&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/105634/Zhang-Daqian ''Encyclopædia Britannica'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sullivan"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sullivan|first=Michael|title=Modern Chinese artists: a biographical dictionary|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, California|year=2006|page=215|isbn=0-520-24449-4|oclc=65644580}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his years of wandering he had several wives simultaneously, curried favor with influential people, and maintained a large entourage of relatives and supporters. He also kept a pet [[gibbon]]. He affected the long robe and long beard of a scholar.&lt;ref name=Smithsonian/&gt;

A meeting between Zhang and [[Picasso]] in [[Nice]], [[France]] in 1956 was viewed as a summit between the preeminent masters of Eastern and Western art. The two men exchanged paintings at this meeting.&lt;ref name=Brit/&gt;

==Artistic career==
Zhang's early professional painting was primarily in [[Shanghai]]. In the late 1920s he moved to [[Beijing]] where he collaborated with [[Puru (artist)|Pu Xinyu]].&lt;ref name=concisebritannica&gt;{{cite web|title=Zhang, Daqian|url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/ebconcise/zhang_daqian|work=Credo Reference - Britannica Concise Encyclopedia|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=16 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s he worked out of a studio on the grounds of the [[Master of the Nets Garden]] in [[Suzhou]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford Companion to Garden. via Oxford Reference Online database|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t215.e1750|author=Maggie Keswick|authorlink=Wangshi Yuan|editor=Patrick Taylor}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940 he led a group of artists in copying the Buddhist wall paintings in the [[Mogao Caves|Mogao]] and [[Yulin Caves|Yulin]] caves. In the late 1950s, his deteriorating eyesight led him to develop his splashed color, or ''pocai'', style.&lt;ref name=concisebritannica/&gt; In the 1970s, he mentored painter [[Minol Araki]].&lt;ref name=ArtDaily&gt;{{cite web |url=http://artdaily.com/news/99330/Minneapolis-Institute-of-Art-opens-first-complete-retrospective-of-Japanese-painter-Minol-Araki |title=Minneapolis Institute of Art opens first complete retrospective of Japanese painter Minol Araki |website=ArtDaily |location=Minneapolis, MN |accessdate=February 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forgeries==
Zhang's forgeries are difficult to detect for many reasons. First, his ability to mimic the great Chinese masters:

{{quote |So prodigious was his virtuosity within the medium of Chinese ink and colour that it seemed he could paint anything. His output spanned a huge range, from archaising works based on the early masters of Chinese painting to the innovations of his late works which connect with the language of Western abstract art.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Jiazi|first1=Chen|title=Chang Dai-Chien: The Enigmatic Genius|publisher=Asian Civilisations Museum|location=Singapore|year=2001|page=9|first2=Ken|last2=Kwok|isbn=981-4068-21-7|oclc=48501375}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Second, he paid scrupulous attention to the materials he used. "He studied paper, ink, brushes, pigments, seals, seal paste, and scroll mountings in exacting detail. When he wrote an inscription on a painting, he sometimes included a postscript describing the type of paper, the age and the origin of the ink, or the provenance of the pigments he had used."

Third, he often forged paintings based on descriptions in catalogues of lost paintings; his forgeries came with ready-made provenance.&lt;ref name= "challenging"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fu|first=Shen CY|title=Challenging the Past: The Paintings of Chang Dai-Chien|publisher=Arthur M Sackler Gallery, Smithsonian Institution; University of Washington Press|location=Seattle, Washington|year=1991|pages=37–38|chapter=3. Painting theory|isbn=0-295-97125-8|oclc=23765860}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zhang's forgeries have been purchased as original paintings by several major art museums in the United States, including the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]:

{{quote |Of particular interest is a master forgery acquired by the Museum in 1957 as an authentic work of the tenth century. The painting, which was allegedly a landscape by the Five Dynasties period master [[Guan Tong]], is one of Zhang’s most ambitious forgeries and serves to illustrate both his skill and his audacity.&lt;ref name="MFA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artknowledgenews.com/Zhang_Daqian_Master_Painter-Master_Forger.html|title=Zhang Daqian — Master Painter/Master Forger|year=2006|work=Art Knowledge News|publisher=Art Appreciation Foundation|accessdate=24 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Art historian [[James Cahill (art historian)|James Cahill]] claimed that the painting ''The Riverbank'', a masterpiece from the [[Southern Tang]] dynasty, held by the [[New York Metropolitan Museum of Art]], was likely another Zhang forgery.&lt;ref name="WaPostMag"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pomfret|first=John|title=The Master Forger|journal=The Washington Post Magazine|date=17 January 1999|page=W14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Museum curators are cautioned to examine Chinese paintings of questionable origins, especially those from the [[bird-and-flower painting|bird and flower]] genre with the query, "Could this be by Chang Dai-chien?"&lt;ref name="MFA"/&gt; Joseph Chang, Curator of Chinese Art at the [[Sackler Museum]], suggested that many notable collections of Chinese art contained forgeries by the master painter.&lt;ref name="WaPostMag"/&gt;

It is estimated that Zhang made more than 10 million dollars selling his forgeries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://authenticationinart.org/aia-archive/aia-unmasked-forgers/|title=Authentication in Art Unmasked Forgers|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Zliten mosaic''' is a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] floor mosaic from about the 2nd century AD, found in the town of [[Zliten]] in [[Libya]], on the east coast of [[Leptis Magna]].&lt;ref name="vinas-zliten"&gt;{{cite web | author=Agnès Vinas | date= | title=Mosaïque de Zliten - Situation géographique de Zliten (Geographic location of Zliten) | publisher=www.mediterranees.net | url=http://www.mediterranees.net/art_antique/oeuvres/zliten/zliten.html | accessdate=February 8, 2011|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mosaic was discovered by the [[Italians|Italian]] [[archaeologist]] Salvatore Aurigemma in 1913 and is now on display at [[The Archaeological Museum of Tripoli]].&lt;ref name="vinas-museum"/&gt; It depicts gladiatorial contests, animal hunts, and scenes from everyday life.&lt;ref name="vinas-frieze"&gt;{{cite web | author=Agnès Vinas | date= | title=Venatio et damnatio ad bestias | publisher=www.mediterranees.net | url=http://www.mediterranees.net/art_antique/oeuvres/zliten/venatio.html | accessdate=February 9, 2011|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The mosaic was discovered in October 1913,&lt;ref name="vinas-museum"&gt;{{cite web | author=Agnès Vinas | date= | title=La mosaïque de Zliten au musée de Tripoli (Zliten mosaic at the museum of Tripoli) | publisher=www.mediterranees.net | url=http://www.mediterranees.net/art_antique/oeuvres/zliten/musee_tripoli.html | accessdate=February 8, 2011|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the ruins of a seaside [[Roman villa]] later called Villa Dar Buk Ammera after the area where it was found.&lt;ref name=roman-hist&gt;{{cite book|last=Rostovtzeff|first=Mikhail Ivanovitch|title=The social and economic history of the Roman Empire, Volume 2|year=1963|publisher=Biblo &amp; Tannen| location=Oxford| isbn=978-0-8196-2164-1| page=276| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6dgC37IqYW0C&amp;lpg=PA276&amp;ots=E43fgjPvML&amp;dq=Dar%20Buk%20Ammerah&amp;pg=PA276#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it was first fully unearthed and visible after the excavations conducted by Salvatore Aurigemma, from 22 June to 18 August 1914,&lt;ref name="vinas-museum"/&gt; it was immediately seen as a masterpiece of [[Mosaics|mosaic art]], but one that was in an emergent need for preservation and restoration.&lt;ref name="vinas-museum"/&gt; In the 1920s, the mosaic was restored and placed on display at [[The Archaeological Museum of Tripoli]]. It moved with the museum to its new location in 1952 and is displayed prominently near the entrance hall.&lt;ref name="vinas-museum" /&gt;

==Dating dispute==
There have been various disputes related to the [[Dating methodologies in archaeology|dating]] of the mosaic, mostly based on archaeological or stylistic comparisons, but the issue remains unresolved.

In his work on the Zliten mosaics, ''Mosaici di Zliten'', 1926,  Aurigemma offers an approximate dating period for the mosaic in the [[Flavian Dynasty]] years (69-96 AD).&lt;ref name="vinas-dating"&gt;{{cite web | author=Agnès Vinas | date= | title=Mosaïque de Zliten - Problèmes de datation (Dating problems) | publisher=www.mediterranees.net | url=http://www.mediterranees.net/art_antique/oeuvres/zliten/datation.html | accessdate=January 30, 2011|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; This chronology would make the mosaic one of the earliest known mosaics of [[North Africa]].&lt;ref name=dunbabin&gt;{{cite book|last=Dunbabin|first=Katherine M.D.|title=Mosaics of the Greek and Roman world|year=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-521-00230-1|pages=119–120|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U7Uu_Dq8oY4C&amp;lpg=PA120&amp;ots=lMWIf_TCCe&amp;dq=%22Essai%20de%20datation%20de%20la%20mosa%C3%AFque%20des%20gladiateurs%20de%20Zliten%22&amp;pg=PA119#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|edition=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He asserts his hypothesis on three arguments:
# The quality of the workmanship of a mosaic in the same villa, situated in an adjoining room, suggests dating as close as possible to the Augustan period (early 1st century AD).
# The [[hairstyle]] of the woman figure shown playing the [[hydraulic organ]] is typical of the [[Flavian Dynasty|Flavian]] period.
# The mosaic's depiction of the capital punishment of ''[[Damnatio ad bestias]]'' appears similar to records of the defeat of [[Garamantes]] recounted by [[Tacitus]] and dated at 70 AD.&lt;ref name="vinas-dating"/&gt;

In 1965, Georges Ville studied the mosaic based on the historical evidence provided by the costumes and weaponry of the protagonists in sections of the mosaic depicting ''[[venatio]]'' (hunting)  and ''[[Gladiatorship|munus]]'' (swordsmanship).&lt;ref&gt;''La Mosaïque Gréco-Romaine: Essai de datation de la mosaïque des gladiateurs de Zliten'' , Paris, 1965.)&lt;/ref&gt; Ville found that the short-sleeved [[tunic]] and the hunters with bare, unprotected legs seem to belong to the late 1st or early 2nd century AD, whereas the type of ''[[thraex]]'' and ''[[murmillo]]''’s helmets seem to be intermediary between that of [[Pompeii]] and that of the gladiator of [[Trajan]] period. Thus, Ville dates the mosaic from the end of the [[Flavian Dynasty|Flavian period]] to the early [[Nerva–Antonine dynasty|Antonine period]] (late 1st or early 2nd century).&lt;ref name="vinas-dating"/&gt;

[[File:Mosaique Zliten.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of musicians playing a [[Roman tuba|Roman ''tuba,'']] a pipe organ ''([[hydraulis]])'', and a pair of ''[[Cornu (horn)|cornua]]''&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Wiedemann, ''Emperors and Gladiators'' (Routledge, 1992, 1995), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Another stylistic comparative analysis by Roman art historian Christine Kondoleon supports an [[Nerva–Antonine dynasty|Antonine period]] dating as a result of the mosaic's multiple design elements. The Zliten floor mosaic employs tressed or braided twisted rope outlines to frame each panel, black backgrounds provide optical contrast and the panels alternate circular and square patterns. These features are in common with the [[Reggio Emilia]] mosaic,&lt;!--which one?--&gt; placed in the Antonine period. Kondoleon also asserts links between the individual designs of these mosaics, especially in the simplified floral forms and scale patterns. Finally, Kondoleon cites the inclusion of the [[Peltarion (shield)|peltarion]], a type of Roman [[shield]], as a further link in other Italian mosaics of the period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kondoleon|first=Christine|authorlink=John Kinnamos|title= Domestic and divine: Roman mosaics in the House of Dionysos |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yin2QKIQ-aMC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=zliten+mosaic&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=tTVETZe0BcGA4Qa45Y0p&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=zliten%20mosaic&amp;f=false|publisher= Cornell University Press |year=1995|pages=73–74|isbn=0-8014-3058-5|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, David Parrish, an [[art history]] professor, proposed 200 AD as the date of the mosaic, a date that coincides with the early [[Severan dynasty]].&lt;ref name="dunbabin" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parrish, in ''African Antiquities'', '''21''', 1985 (pages 137-158)&lt;/ref&gt; In a comparison of the [[Roman military personal equipment|military equipment]] of the two [[Samnites]] in the Zliten mosaic with the warriors in the mosaic of [[Bad Kreuznach]] (Germany), dated c. 250 AD, Parrish emphasizes their similarities. He performed a similar comparison between the [[duel]]s of ''[[retiarius]]'' and ''[[secutor]]'' in the Zliten mosaic and those of the mosaic of [[Nennig]] in Germany, dated c. 240-250 AD. Additionally, Parrish concludes that the mosaic of the [[El Djem]] [[amphitheatre]], dated c. 200 AD, has particularly evident links to the Zliten mosaic in terms of the realistic rendering of space on white background, and the absence of shadows and isolated plots of land.&lt;ref name="vinas-dating"/&gt; This methodology is criticized by some scholars, including Roman art historian Katherine Dunbabin, for relying on overly broad stylistic parallels between the works.&lt;ref name="dunbabin" /&gt;

{{Quotation|Whoever designed the characters and figures [of this mosaic] had an incredibly exquisite artistic temperament - master of the form and model, robust and sensible; maybe he was a Greek, in any case a very great artist, who had naturally chosen artistic collaborators of the same quality, or who maybe had conducted himself the work on the mosaic. In any respect, he had inspired these characters - ready to die with great fanfare - with the sound of music and shouts of people, a life and a spirit that shouldn't die. One searches in vain for such a life (at least for such a degree of nobleness and power) in the other similar representations of gladiatorial combats (in painting and especially in sculpture) that have survived since antiquity to our days.&lt;ref name="Munus"&gt;{{cite web | author=Agnès Vinas | date= | title= La représentation d'un munus sur la mosaïque de Zliten (The representation of a munus on the mosaic of Zliten) | publisher=www.mediterranees.net | url=http://www.mediterranees.net/art_antique/oeuvres/zliten/munus.html | accessdate=February 8, 2011|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Salvatore Aurigemma (translated from Italian)}}

==Composition==
[[File:Gladiators from the Zliten mosaic 3.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Gladiators from the Zliten mosaic.]]
Portions of the Zliten mosaic are realized through a combination of three techniques: [[opus tessellatum]], [[opus vermiculatum]] and [[opus sectile]].&lt;ref name="vinas-comp"&gt;{{cite web | author=Agnès Vinas | date= | title=La composition de la mosaïque (Composition of the mosaic) | publisher=www.mediterranees.net | url=http://www.mediterranees.net/art_antique/oeuvres/zliten/composition.html | accessdate=January 30, 2011|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= |first= |authorlink= Robert Lorentz Scranton, Joseph W. Shaw, Leila Ibrahim |title=Topography and architecture |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5dQUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA104&amp;dq=zliten+mosaic&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=hDNETZi9OJqK4gbx4MEV&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=zliten&amp;f=false |publisher=E. J. Brill, Leiden, The Netherlands |year=1975|isbn=90-04-04886-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The external black and white geometric border is created with the [[opus tessellatum]] technique.&lt;ref name="vinas-comp" /&gt;

The central part of the mosaic is composed of geometric alternating square panels with each side measuring {{convert|0.45|m|ft|abbr=on}} and realized in the [[opus sectile]] technique. Within these panels are circular ''[[emblem]]ata'' depicting fish and other [[marine (ocean)|marine]] creatures ([[shrimp]], [[murex]], [[picarel]], [[conger]], [[sea urchin]], [[garfish]] etc...) in the [[opus vermiculatum]] technique.&lt;ref name="vinas-comp" /&gt;
