'''Anomie''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|n|ə|ˌ|m|i}}) is a "condition in which society provides little [[Morality|moral]] guidance to individuals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gerber |first=John J. Macionis, Linda M. |title=Sociology |year=2010 |publisher=Pearson Canada |location=Toronto |isbn=978-0-13-700161-3 |pages=97 |edition=7th Canadian}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the breakdown of social bonds between an individual and the community, e.g., under unruly scenarios resulting in fragmentation of social identity and rejection of self-regulatory [[Value (ethics)|values]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://roomfordebate.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/13/chinas-school-killings-and-social-despair/?ref=world NYtimes blogs]&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} 

The term is commonly understood to mean ''normlessness'', and believed to have been popularized by French sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]] in his influential book ''[[Suicide (book)|Suicide]]'' (1897). However, Durkheim first introduces the concept of anomie in his 1893 work ''The Division of Labour In Society''. Durkheim never used the term ''normlessness''; rather, he described anomie as "derangement", and "an insatiable will".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mestrovic |first=Stjepan |title=Emile Durkheim and The Reformation of Sociology}}&lt;/ref&gt; Durkheim used the term "the malady of the infinite" because desire without limit can never be fulfilled; it only becomes more intense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/43421884|title=Emile Durkheim : law in a moral domain|last=M.),|first=Cotterrell, Roger (Roger B.|publisher=|year=1999|isbn=0804738238|location=|pages=19|oclc=43421884|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Durkheim, anomie arises more generally from a mismatch between personal or group standards and wider social standards, or from the lack of a social ethic, which produces moral deregulation and an absence of legitimate aspirations. This is a nurtured condition:
{{quote |Most sociologists associate the term with Durkheim, who used the concept to speak of the ways in which an individual's actions are matched, or integrated, with a system of social norms and practices … anomie is a mismatch, not simply the absence of norms. Thus, a society with too much rigidity and little individual discretion could also produce a kind of anomie ...&lt;ref name="quot0"&gt;Susan Leigh Star, Geoffrey C. Bowker, and Laura J. Neumann, "Transparency At Different Levels of Scale: Convergence between Information Artifacts and Social Worlds", Library and Information Science, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, August 1997&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

== History ==
In 1893 Durkheim introduced the concept of ''anomie'' to describe the mismatch of collective guild labour to evolving societal needs when the guild was homogeneous in its constituency. He equated homogeneous (redundant) skills to ''mechanical solidarity'' whose inertia retarded adaptation. He contrasted this with the self-regulating behaviour of a division of labour based on differences in constituency, equated to ''organic solidarity'', whose lack of inertia made it sensitive to needed changes.

Durkheim observed that the conflict between the evolved organic division of labour and the homogeneous mechanical type was such that one could not exist in the presence of the other.&lt;ref name="quot1"&gt;The Division of Labor in Society, The MacMillan Co. 1933, Free Press edition, 1964, pp. 182-183&lt;/ref&gt;

When solidarity is organic, anomie is impossible.&lt;ref name="quot4"&gt;The Division of Labor in Society, The MacMillan Co. 1933, Free Press edition, 1964, pp. 368-369&lt;/ref&gt; Sensitivity to mutual needs promotes evolution in the division of labour. "Producers, being near consumers, can easily reckon the extent of the needs to be satisfied. Equilibrium is established without any trouble and production regulates itself."&lt;ref name="quot4"/&gt; Durkheim contrasted the condition of anomie as being the result of a malfunction of organic solidarity after the transition to mechanical solidarity: {{quote|But on the contrary, if some opaque environment is interposed ... relations [are] rare, are not repeated enough ... are too intermittent. Contact is no longer sufficient. The producer can no longer embrace the market at a glance, nor even in thought. He can no longer see its limits, since it is, so to speak limitless. Accordingly, production becomes unbridled and unregulated.&lt;ref name="quot4"/&gt;}}

Durkheim's use of the term anomie was about the phenomenon of industrialization—mass-regimentation that could not adapt due to its own inertia—its resistance to change, which causes disruptive cycles of collective behavior e.g. economics, due to the necessity of a prolonged buildup of sufficient force or momentum to overcome the inertia.

Later in 1897, in his studies of suicide, Durkheim associated anomie to the influence of a lack of norms or norms that were too rigid. But such normlessness or norm-rigidity was a ''symptom of anomie'', caused by the lack of differential adaptation that would enable norms to evolve naturally due to self-regulation, either to develop norms where none existed or to change norms that had become rigid and obsolete.

In 1938 Robert K. Merton linked anomie with [[Robert K. Merton#Theory of deviance|deviance]] and argued that the discontinuity between culture and structure have the dysfunctional consequence of leading to deviance within society. He described 5 types of deviance in terms of the acceptance or rejection of social goals and the institutionalized means of achieving them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Merton|first=Robert K.|date=1938|title=Social Structure and Anomie|jstor=2084686|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=3|issue=5|pages=672–682|doi=10.2307/2084686}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
{{See also|Antinomianism}}
The word, "a reborrowing with French spelling of ''anomy''",&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|anomie}}&lt;/ref&gt; comes from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἀνομία}} "lawlessness",&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|anomy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)nomi/a|ἀνομία|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; namely the [[privative alpha]] [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]] (''a-'' "without"), and ''nomos'' "law". The Greeks distinguished between ''nomos'' ({{lang|grc|νόμος}}, "law"), and ''arché'' ({{lang|grc|ἀρχή}}, "starting rule, axiom, principle"). For example, a [[monarch]] is a single ruler but he or she might still be subject to, and not exempt from, the prevailing laws, i.e. ''nomos''. In the original [[city state]] [[democracy]], the [[majority rule]] was an aspect of ''arché'' because it was a rule-based, customary system, which might or might not make laws, i.e. ''nomos''. Thus, the original meaning of ''anomie'' defined anything or anyone against or outside the law, or a condition where the current laws were not applied resulting in a state of illegitimacy or lawlessness.

The contemporary English understanding of the word ''anomie'' can accept greater flexibility in the word "[[norm (sociology)|norm]]", and some have used the idea of normlessness to reflect a similar situation to the idea of [[Anarchism|anarchy]]. But, as used by Émile Durkheim and later theorists, ''anomie'' is a reaction against or a retreat from the regulatory [[social control]]s of [[society]], and is a completely separate concept from anarchy, which consists of the absence of the roles of rulers and submitted.

== Social disorder ==

The nineteenth century [[France|French]] pioneer [[sociologist]] Émile Durkheim borrowed the word from French philosopher [[Jean-Marie Guyau]] and used it in his influential book ''[[Suicide (book)|Suicide]]'' (1897), outlining the social (and not individual) causes of [[suicide]], characterized by a rapid change of the standards or values of societies (often erroneously referred to as normlessness), and an associated feeling of [[Social alienation|alienation]] and purposelessness. He believed that ''anomie'' is common when the surrounding society has undergone significant changes in its economic fortunes, whether for better or for worse and, more generally, when there is a significant discrepancy between the ideological theories and values commonly professed and what was actually achievable in everyday life. This was contrary to previous theories on suicide which generally maintained that suicide was precipitated by negative events in a person's life and their subsequent [[clinical depression|depression]].

In Durkheim's view, traditional [[religion]]s often provided the basis for the shared values which the anomic individual lacks. Furthermore, he argued that the [[division of labor]] that had been prevalent in economic life since the [[Industrial Revolution]] led individuals to pursue [[egotism|egoistic]] ends rather than seeking the good of a larger community. [[Robert King Merton]] also adopted the idea of anomie to develop [[Strain theory (sociology)|strain theory]], defining it as the discrepancy between common social goals and the legitimate means to attain those goals. In other words, an individual suffering from anomie would strive to attain the common goals of a specific society yet would not be able to reach these goals legitimately because of the [[structuralism|structural]] limitations in society. As a result, the individual would exhibit [[deviance (sociology)|deviant behavior]]. [[Friedrich Hayek]] notably uses the word ''anomie'' with this meaning.

According to one academic survey, psychometric testing confirmed a link between anomie and [[academic dishonesty]] among university students, suggesting that universities needed to foster codes of ethics among students in order to curb it.&lt;ref&gt;"The effect of anomie on academic dishonesty among university students" by Albert Caruana, B. Ramaseshan, Michael T. Ewing. ''International Journal of Educational Management'' (2000). Volume 14, issue 1. pp. 23–30.&lt;/ref&gt; In another study, anomie was seen as a "push factor" in tourism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an older variant, the 1913 ''[[Webster's Dictionary]]'' reports use of the word ''anomie'' as meaning "disregard or violation of the law"&lt;ref&gt;"Anomie, authoritarianism, and prejudice: A replication" by A. H. Roberts, M. Rokeach, ''American Journal of Sociology'', 1956&lt;/ref&gt; but anomie as a social disorder is not to be confused with [[anarchy]]. Proponents of [[anarchism]] claim that anarchy does not necessarily lead to anomie and that hierarchical command actually increases lawlessness. Some [[anarcho-primitivism|anarcho-primitivists]] argue that complex societies, particularly industrial and post-industrial societies, directly cause conditions such as anomie by depriving the individual of self-determination and a relatively small reference group to relate to, such as the band, clan, or tribe.

== In literature, film, and theatre ==

In [[Albert Camus]]'s [[existentialist novel]] ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]]'', the bored, alienated protagonist Meursault struggles to construct an individual system of values as he responds to the disappearance of the old. He exists largely in a state of anomie,&lt;ref name=wilson1&gt;{{cite book|title=The Study of Lives: Essays on Personality in Honor of Henry A. Murray|year=1963|publisher=Atherton Prentice-Hall|pages=352–359|author=Robert N. Wilson|edition=First|editor=Robert W. White|chapter=15, Albert Camus: Personality as Creative Struggle}}&lt;/ref&gt; as seen from the apathy evinced in the opening lines: ''{{lang|fr|"Aujourd’hui, maman est morte. Ou peut-être hier, je ne sais pas"}}'' ("Today mother died. Or maybe yesterday, I don't know").

[[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] expressed a similar concern about anomie in his novel ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]''. [[The Grand Inquisitor]] remarks that in the absence of God and immortal life, everything would be lawful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Can Civilization Survive Without God?

Unfortunately, these are problems of human society and the human psyche — you might say, soul — whatever attitude we take to the humanness or the transcendent.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, that any act becomes thinkable, that there is no moral compass, which leads to apathy and detachment.

She received a BSc (Hons) in geophysics from the [[University of Edinburgh]], UK, and was awarded a PhD from the [[University of Leeds]], UK, for research on subduction zone structure beneath southern North Island, [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.codes.utas.edu.au/staff/amreading/pdfs/AMR_CV_2page_2011.pdf]{{dead link|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr Reading spent five years in marine and land-based geophysics with the [[British Antarctic Survey]] before she joined the University of Edinburgh as a lecturer in 1998. In 1999 she received a Diploma of Music from the [[Open University]]. In 2000 she moved to [[Australia]] and was a research fellow at [[Australian National University|ANU]] before she joined the University of Tasmania as an academic staff member in 2007.

Dr Reading's research interests include computational methods for analysing data from the natural world, seismological techniques, using ambient seismic energy, the tectonic evolution of Australasia and Antarctica, archaeological and other near-surface geophysics.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

[[File:Copper Tube Evaporator.jpg|thumb|This is Coil|228px]]
A '''coil''', in [[chemistry]], is a tube, frequently in spiral form, used commonly to cool steam originating from a [[distillation]] and thus to [[Condensation|condense]] it in [[liquid]] form. Usually it is of [[copper]] or another material that conducts heat easily. Coils are often used in chemical processes in batch reaction or mixing tank as internal source of heat transfer.

{{italic title}}
'''''Der Philosophische Arzt''''' is a medical publication published in the late 18th century by {{Interlanguage link multi|Melchior Adam Weikard|de}}, a prominent German physician and physician to the Russian Empress, [[Catherine II]].

The first edition of ''Der Philosophische Arzt'' was first published in 1775, but perhaps as early as 1770.  It was initially published anonymously as was the second edition, though it was widely believed that Weikard was the author.  The reason for doing so is unclear but was probably due to anticipated critical reactions to its publication from several sources.  A principal one was the Prince-Bishop of Fulda, to whom Weikard served as physician and in a [[Catholic]] region where Weikard worked as a spa doctor being supported by the state. According to Otto Schmitt's biography of Weikard published in 1970, the reaction of organized religion to the publication of his textbook was widespread condemnation.  This was likely due to his attacks in the textbook on various religious practices for curing medical illnesses. According to Schmidt, the attacks against Weikard continued throughout his career but his patron, [[Heinrich von Bibra|Prince Heinrich von Bibra]], maintained an amicable relationship with him and supported him financially late in his career despite many people who criticized the Prince for doing so.&lt;ref name="Barkley2012"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Barkley | first1 = RA. | last2 = Peters | first2 = H. | last3 = Weikard | first3 = MA. | title = The earliest reference to ADHD in the medical literature?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2033">The '''Diabasbrottet Quarry''' ({{coord|58|21|32.2|N|12|30|08.6|E}}), located on [[Hunneberg|Mt. Hunneberg]], [[Västergötland]], [[Sweden]], is the location of the [[Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point]] (GSSP) which marks the lower boundary of the  [[Floian]] stage of the [[Lower Ordovician]].

The lower boundary of the [[Floian]] is defined as the [[first appearance datum|first appearance]] of ''[[Tetragraptus approximatus]]'', a [[graptolite]] species. The rock section, dominated by [[shale]], is unusually [[fossil]]iferous, including fossilized remains of graptolites, [[conodont]]s, and [[trilobite]]s. It is highly compressed, and the Ordovician section is only 12 m thick.

The [[Floian]] stage is named after [[Flo Parish, Sweden|Flo Parish]], a village 5 km to the southeast of the Diabasbrottet quarry.

It was selected over "The Ledge" in western [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] in 2000 and ratified as the GSSP by the [[International Union of Geological Sciences]] in 2002.

'''Dimitar Ivanov Popov''' ({{lang-bg|Димитър Иванов Попов}}) (October 13, 1894 – October 25, 1975) was a [[Bulgaria]]n [[organic chemist]] and an [[academician]] of the [[Bulgarian Academy of Sciences]].

Prof. D. Ivanov is known by his father's name '''Ivanov''' rather than his family's name '''Popov'''.

He is the namesake of the [[Ivanov reaction]]&lt;ref&gt;D. Ivanoff, A. Spassoff. Condensation des phénylacétate et para-chlorphénylacétate d'éthyle au moyen des halogénures d'isopropyl-magnesium. - Bull. Soc. chim. France, [4] 49, 1931, 375.&lt;/ref&gt; in chemistry.

Although [[thinning]] originated as a man-made [[forest management]] tool, aimed at increasing [[timber]] yields, the shift from production forests to multifunctional forests brought with it the cutting of trees to manipulate an [[ecosystem]] for various reasons, ranging from removing [[introduced species|non-native species]] from a plot to removing [[populus|poplars]] growing on a riverside beach aimed at recreational use.

Since the 1970s, leaving the thinned trees on the forest floor has become an increasingly common policy: wood can be [[Decomposition#Plant decomposition|decomposed]] in a more natural fashion, playing an important role in increasing [[biodiversity]] by providing habitat to various [[invertebrates]], [[birds]] and small [[mammals]]. Many [[fungi]] (e.g. ''[[Calocera viscosa]]'') and [[mosses]] are [[saproxylic]] or [[epixylic]] as well (e.g. ''[[Marchantiophyta]]'') – some moss species completing their entire life-cycle on a single log.

Where trees are managed under a commercial regime, competition is reduced by removing adjacent stems that exhibit less favourable timber quality potential. When left in a natural state trees will "self-thin", but this process can be unreliable in some circumstances. Examples of this can be found in the [[Buxus]] – [[Ironbark]] forests and [[woodland]]s of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] (Australia) where a large proportion of trees are [[coppice]], resultant from timber cutting in decades gone by.

==Ecophysiological repercussions==

Thinning decreases [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]] closure and increases the penetration of solar radiation into the canopy. The [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] efficiency of this energy is improved, and needle retention is prolonged, especially in the lower parts of the [[Crown (botany)|crown]]. The root system, [[Tree crown measurement|crown length, crown diameter, and crown area]] all increase after thinning.&lt;ref name="miss"&gt;Misson, L.; Vincke, C.; Devillez, F. 2003. Frequency responses of radial growth series after different thinning intensities in Norway spruce (''Picea abies'' [L.] Karst.) stands. For. Ecol. Manage. 177(1–3):51–63.&lt;/ref&gt; Even if soil evaporation and individual tree transpiration increases after thinning, total evapo-transpiration at stand level tends to decrease;&lt;ref name="whit"&gt;Whitehead, D.; Jarvis, P.G.; Waring, R.H. 1984. Stomatal conductance, transpiration, and resistance to water uptake in a ''Pinus sylvestris'' spacing experiment. Can. J. For. Res. 14:692–700.&lt;/ref&gt; canopy water interception is reduced and throughfall increased, so that tree-water status usually improves after thinning.

Radial annual growth is an integrative index of tree physiological response to environmental variation. Working with [[Picea abies|Norway spruce]], which can be expected to behave in some respects similarly to white spruce, Misson et al.&lt;ref name="miss" /&gt; showed that a reduction in stand density alters the classical climate–growth relationship. At individual tree level, thinning could be used to increase tree resistance to drought stress. Nevertheless, this effect is limited when site conditions are limiting. Misson et al.&lt;ref name="miss" /&gt; concluded that heavy thinning should be applied when forest decline is expected from drought stress. Furthermore, stands on dry sites should be thinned more heavily because such sites cannot support high-density stands.

Forst. 138:685–700.&lt;/ref&gt; also working with Norway spruce, investigated the response to thinning. Thinning altered the temporal evolution of radial growth at all frequencies in radial growth chronologies. Previous studies had shown, not surprisingly, that thinning decreases the canopy closure and encourages solar radiation to penetrate the canopy.&lt;ref name="auss" /&gt;&lt;ref name="habon"&gt;Habonimana, B. 2000.

Effect of thinning on parameters of photosynthetic characteristics of Norway spruce canopy. I. Light penetration and photosynthesis. Lesnictvi-Forestry 43:141–153.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the length, diameter, and area, of the crown, and the size of the root system all increase after thinning.&lt;ref name="leh"&gt;Lehtpere, R. 1960.

These modifications at the crown level influence photosynthate production positively as long as water supply is not limiting. Even if soil evaporation and individual tree transpiration are more important after thinning, total evapo-transpiration at stand level tends to decrease.&lt;ref name="whit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mor"&gt;Morikawa, Y.; Hattori, S.; Kiyono, Y. 1986. Transpiration of a 3-year-old ''Chamaecyparis obtusa'' Endl. stand before and after thinning. Tree Physiol. 2:105–114.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, with the reduced importance of leaf area index (LAI), thinning reduces canopy water interception and increases throughfall.&lt;ref name="fran1"&gt;François, F.; Mertens, P.; André, P.; Devillez, F. 1984. Egouttement en jeunes pessières et intensité de la première éclaircie. Ann. Sci. For. 41:439–448.&lt;/ref&gt; This explains why the soil moisture content increases in a thinned stand.&lt;ref name="dell"&gt;Della-Bianca, L.; Dills, R.E. 1960. Some effects of stand density in a red pine plantation on soil moisture, soil temperature, and radial growth. J. For. 58:373–377.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, during the vegetation period, tree-water status is usually better in a thinned stand than in a high-density stand.&lt;ref name="ginn"&gt;Ginn, S.E.; Seiler, J.R.; Cazell, B.H.; Kreh, R.E. 1991. Physiological and growth responses of eight-year-old loblolly pine stands to thinning. For. Sci. 37:1030–1040.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sto"&gt;Stoneman, G.L.; Crombie, D.S.; Whitford, K.; Hingston, F.J.; Giles, R.; Portlock, C.C.; Galbraith, J.H.; Dimmock, G.M. 1996. Growth and water relations of ''Eucalyptus marginata'' (jarrah) stands in response to thinning and fertilisation. Tree Physiol. 16:267–274.&lt;/ref&gt;

For semi-tolerant species such as Norway spruce and white spruce, solar energy is less limiting than for intolerant species. This can account for the exponential relationship found by Misson et al.&lt;ref name="miss" /&gt; between thinning intensity and mean radial growth. Only when thinning was relatively severe did important radial growth variation occur. Furthermore, the ecophysiological advantage of an improved water supply could be counterbalanced by limiting site conditions.

For Norway spruce in the Belgian Ardennes, Misson et al.&lt;ref name="miss" /&gt; recommended that stand basal area should not exceed 26 m²/ha on a dry site, or 29 m²/ha on a moist site if the objective is to maintain high long-term radial growth.

Misson et al.&lt;ref name="miss" /&gt; found that adaptations to thinning cover a continuous range of different time scales, with long-, medium-, and short-term growth variations being controlled by very different internal factors influenced by the environment. Misson et al.&lt;ref name="miss" /&gt; ascribed what they called long- and medium-term radial growth variation of individual trees mainly to structural adaptation, such as enlargement of the crown or the root system. Short-term radial growth variations, on the other hand, were considered to be due mainly to physiological [[Acclimatization|acclimatisation]], with response to factors such as [[stoma]]tal conductance regulation, variation of photosynthetic capacity, and respiration. Nevertheless, it is clear that the adaptations are linked, and that radial growth is the integrative response of this mutual inter-relationship.&lt;ref name="kah"&gt;Kahle, H.P.; Spiecker, H. 1996.

== Research ==
Research programs under way in various parts of the world (e.g. United States and Australia) are aimed at providing an alternate approach in [[forest management]] where [[Conservation movement|conservation]] objectives are a high priority. Methods of ecological thinning being developed on [[silviculture|silvicultural]] techniques for local forest types. Ecological thinning is being developed using two principles: 1. appropriate stem reduction to reduce competition and 2. retention of trees (selection) that are more suitable for wildlife (i.e. not timber production).  An example of ecological thinning research is the project in Victoria's [[Box-Ironbark forest]]s, investigating various thinning and timber removal methods under an [[adaptive management]] or AEM framework. The primary objective is to generate (over time) a number of forest habitat values (i.e. [[tree hollows]]) that are crucial for [[wildlife conservation]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18615">The '''facial feedback hypothesis''' states that facial movement can influence [[emotion]]al experience. For example, an individual who is forced to [[smile]] during a social event will actually come to find the event more of an enjoyable experience.

==Background==
[[File:Charles Darwin.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Charles Darwin]]]]
[[File:wm james.jpg|thumb|upright|[[William James]]]]

[[Charles Darwin]] was among the first to suggest that physiological changes caused by an emotion had a direct impact ''on'', rather than being just the consequence ''of'' that emotion. He wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The free expression by outward signs of an emotion intensifies it. On the other hand, the repression, as far as this is possible, of all outward signs softens our emotions... Even the simulation of an emotion tends to arouse it in our minds.&lt;ref name=Darwin1872&gt;Darwin, C. (1872). ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]]''. London:John Murray, 366. [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1142&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=1 Fulltext].&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|366}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following on this idea, [[William James]] proposed that, contrary to common belief, awareness of bodily changes activated by a stimulus "''is'' the emotion".&lt;ref name=James1890&gt;James, W. (1890). ''[[The Principles of Psychology]]''. [http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/James/Principles/prin25.htm Fulltext].&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|449}} If no bodily changes are felt, there is only an intellectual thought, devoid of emotional warmth. In ''The Principles of Psychology'', James wrote: "Refuse to express a passion, and it dies".&lt;ref name=James1890/&gt;{{rp|463}}

This proved difficult to test, and little evidence was available, apart from some animal research and studies of people with severely impaired emotional functioning. The facial feedback hypothesis, "that skeletal muscle feedback from facial expressions plays a causal role in regulating emotional experience and behaviour",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Buck|first= Ross|date= 1980|title= 
Nonverbal Behavior and the Theory of Emotion: The Facial Feedback Hypothesis|url= |journal= [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]]|publisher= |volume= 38|issue= 5|page= 813|doi= 10.1037/0022-3514.38.5.811}}&lt;!--|accessdate=9 November 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; developed almost a century after Darwin.

==Development of the theory==

While James included the influence of all bodily changes on the creation of an emotion, "including among them visceral, muscular, and cutaneous effects",&lt;ref name=AdelmannZajonc1989&gt;{{cite journal |last= Adelmann|first= Pamela K.|last2= Zajonc|first2= Robert B.|date= 1989|title= Facial efference and the experience of emotion|url= |journal= [[Annual Review of Psychology]]|publisher= |volume= 40|issue=1 |pages= 249–280|doi= 10.1146/annurev.psych.40.1.249}}&lt;!--|accessdate=9 November 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|252}} modern research mainly focuses on the effects of facial muscular activity. One of the first to do so, [[Silvan Tomkins]] wrote in 1962 that "the face expresses affect, both to others and the self, via feedback, which is more rapid and more complex than any stimulation of which the slower moving visceral organs are capable".&lt;ref name=AdelmannZajonc1989/&gt;{{rp|255}}

Two versions of the facial feedback hypothesis appeared, although "these distinctions have not always been consistent".&lt;ref name=ZajoncMurphyInglehart1989&gt;{{cite journal |last= Zajonc|first= R. B.|last2= Murphy|first2= Sheila T.|last3= Inglehart|first3= Marita|date= 1989|title= Feeling and Facial Efference: Implications of the Vascular Theory of Emotion|url= http://psychology.stanford.edu/~lera/273/zajonc-psychreview-1989.pdf|journal= [[Psychological Review]]|publisher= |volume= 96|issue= 3|page= 396|doi= 10.1037/0033-295x.96.3.395|accessdate=9 November 2014 |pmid=2756066}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The ''weak'' version, introduced by Darwin, sees the feedback intensify or reduce an emotion already present. [[Thomas McCanne]] and [[Judith Anderson (psychologist)|Judith Anderson]] (1987)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= McCanne|first= Thomas R.|last2= Anderson|first2= Judith A.|date= April 1987|title= Emotional Responding Following Experimental Manipulation of Facial Electromyographic Activity|url= |journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|publisher= |volume= 52|issue= 4|pages= 759–768|doi= 10.1037/0022-3514.52.4.759}}&lt;!--|accessdate=9 November 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; instructed participants to suppress or increase the [[Zygomaticus major muscle|zygomatic]] or [[corrugator supercilii muscle|corrugator]] muscle while imagining pleasant or unpleasant scenes. Subsequent alteration of the emotional response was shown to have occurred. 
*The ''strong'' version implies that facial feedback by itself can create the whole emotion.

According to Jeffrey Browndyke,&lt;ref&gt;Browndyke, J. N. (2002). [http://www.neuropsychologycentral.com/interface/content/resources/page_material/resources_general_materials_pages/resources_document_pages/neuropsychosocial_factors_in_emotion_recognition.pdf "Neuropsycholosocial factors in emotion recognition: Facial expressions"], p3.&lt;/ref&gt; "the strongest evidence for the facial feedback hypothesis to date comes from research by Lanzetta et al. (1976)" (but see "Studies using Botox" below for more recent and powerful evidence). Participants had lower [[Skin conductance response|skin conductance]] and subjective ratings of pain when hiding the painfulness of the shocks they endured, compared with those who expressed intense pain.

However, in all research, difficulty remained in how to measure an effect without alerting the participant to the nature of the study and how to ensure that the connection between facial activity and corresponding emotion is not implicit in the procedure.

==Methodological issues==

Originally, the facial feedback hypothesis studied the enhancing or suppressing effect of facial efference on emotion in the context of spontaneous, "real" emotions, using [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]]. This resulted in "the inability of research using spontaneous efference to separate [[correlation]] from causality".&lt;ref name=AdelmannZajonc1989/&gt;{{rp|264}} Laird (1974)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Laird|first= James D.|date= 1974|title= Self-attribution of emotion: The effects of expressive behavior on the quality of emotional experience|url= |journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|publisher= |volume= 29|issue= 4|pages= 475–486|doi= 10.1037/h0036125}}&lt;!--|accessdate=9 November 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; used a cover story (measuring muscular facial activity with electrodes) to induce particular facial muscles contraction in his participants without mentioning any emotional state. However, the higher funniness ratings of the cartoons obtained by those participants "tricked" into smiling may have been caused by their recognising the muscular contraction and its corresponding emotion: the "[[self-perception mechanism]]", which Laird (1974) thought was at the root of the facial feedback phenomenon. Perceiving physiological changes, people "fill the blank" by feeling the corresponding emotion. In the original studies, Laird had to exclude 16% (Study 1) and 19% (Study 2) of the participants as they had become aware of the physical and emotional connection during the study.

Another difficulty is whether the process of manipulation of the facial muscles did not cause so much exertion and fatigue that those, partially or wholly, caused the physiological changes and subsequently the emotion.
Finally, the presence of physiological change may have been induced or modified by [[cognitive]] process.

==Experimental confirmation==

[[File:Orbicularis oris.jpg|right|thumb|Orbicularis oris muscle]]

In an attempt to provide a clear assessment of the theory that a purely physical facial change, involving only certain facial muscles, can result in an emotion, Strack, Martin, &amp; Stepper (1988)&lt;ref name=StrackMartinStepper1988&gt;{{cite journal |last= Strack|first= Fritz|last2= Martin|first2= Leonard L.|last3= Stepper|first3= Sabine|date= May 1988|title= Inhibiting and Facilitating Conditions of the Human Smile: A Nonobtrusive Test of the Facial Feedback Hypothesis|url= |journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|publisher= |volume= 54|issue= 5|pages= 768–777|doi= 10.1037/0022-3514.54.5.768|pmid= 3379579}}&lt;!--|accessdate=9 November 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; devised a cover story that would ensure the participants adopt the desired facial posing without being able to perceive either the corresponding emotion or the researchers' real motive. Told they were taking part in a study to determine the difficulty for people without the use of their hands or arms to accomplish certain tasks, participants held a pen in their mouth in one of two ways. The Lip position would contract the [[orbicularis oris muscle]], resulting in a frown. The Teeth position would cause the [[Zygomaticus major muscle|zygomaticus major]] or the [[risorius muscle]], resulting in a smile. The [[control group]] would hold the pen in their nondominant hand. All had to fill a questionnaire in that position and rate the difficulty involved. The last task, which was the real objective of the test, was the subjective rating of the funniness of a cartoon. The test differed from previous methods in that there were no emotional states to emulate, dissimulate or exaggerate.

As predicted, participants in the Teeth condition reported significantly higher amusement ratings than those in the Lips condition. The cover story and the procedure were found to be very successful at initiating the required contraction of the muscles without arising suspicion, 'cognitive interpretation of the facial action,&lt;ref name=StrackMartinStepper1988/&gt; and avoiding significant [[demand effect|demand]] and [[order effects]]. It has been suggested that more effort may be involved in holding a pen with the lips compared with the teeth.&lt;ref name=ZajoncMurphyInglehart1989/&gt;

To avoid the possible effort problem, Zajonc, Murphy and Inglehart (1989) had subjects repeat different vowels, provoking smiles with "ah" sounds and frowns with "ooh" sounds for example, and again found a measurable effect of facial feedback.&lt;ref name=ZajoncMurphyInglehart1989/&gt; Ritual chanting of smile vowels has been found to be more pleasant than chanting of frown vowels, which may explain their comparative prevalence in religious [[mantra]] traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Böttger, D. (2010) ''To say "Krishna" is to smile - emotion psychology and the neurology of mantra singing.'' In "The Varieties of Ritual Experience" (ed. Jan Weinhold &amp; Geoffrey Samuel) in the series "Ritual Dynamics and the Science of Ritual", Volume II: "Body, performance, agency and experience". Wiesbaden, Germany: Harrassowitz.&lt;/ref&gt;

These studies have resolved many of the methodological issues associated with the facial feedback hypothesis. Darwin's theory can be demonstrated, and the moderate, yet significant effect of this theory of emotions opens the door to new research on the "multiple and nonmutually exclusive plausible mechanisms"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= McIntosh|first= Daniel N.|date= 1996|title= Facial feedback hypotheses: Evidence, implications, and directions|url= |journal= Motivation and Emotion|publisher= |volume= 20|issue= 2|pages= 121–147|doi= 10.1007/BF02253868}}&lt;!--|accessdate=9 November 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; of the effects of facial activity on emotions.

Doubts about the robustness of these findings was voiced in 2016 when a [[replication crisis|replication series]] of the original 1988 experiment coordinated by [[Eric-Jan Wagenmakers]] and conducted in 17 labs did not find any support for the hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Wagenmakers |first=E.-J. |last2=Beek |first2=T. |last3=Dijkhoff |first3=L. |last4=Gronau |first4=Q.

==Studies using botulinum toxin (botox)==
[[File:Musculuscorrugatorsupercilii.png|right|thumb|Corrugator supercilii muscle]]

Because facial expressions involve both motor ([[:wikt:efferent|efferent]]) and sensory ([[:wikt:afferent|afferent]]) mechanisms, it is possible that effects attributed to facial feedback are due solely to feedback mechanisms, or feed-forward mechanisms, or some combination of both.  Recently, strong experimental support for a facial feedback mechanism is provided through the use of [[botulinum toxin]] (commonly known as Botox) to temporarily paralyze facial muscles.  Botox selectively blocks muscle feedback by blocking presynaptic [[acetylcholine receptors]] at the [[neuromuscular junction]].  Thus, while motor efference commands to the facial muscles remain intact, sensory afference from [[extrafusal muscle fibers]], and possibly [[intrafusal muscle fibers]], is diminished.

Several studies have examined the [[Correlation coefficient|correlation]] of botox injections and emotion&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Botulinum toxin cosmetic therapy correlates with a more positive mood|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1473-2165.2009.00419.x/abstract|journal = Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology|date = 2009-03-01|issn = 1473-2165|pages = 24–26|volume = 8|issue = 1|doi = 10.1111/j.1473-2165.2009.00419.x|first = Michael B|last = Lewis|first2 = Patrick J|last2 = Bowler}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.chevychasecosmeticcenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Botox_Depression_Study_pressreleaseFINAL1.pdf|title = |date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and these suggest that the toxin could be used as a treatment for depression.  Further studies have used [[experimental control]] to test the hypothesis that botox affects aspects of emotional processing.  It has been suggested that the treatment of nasal muscles would reduce the ability of the person to form a [[disgust]] response which could offer a reduction of symptoms associated with [[Obsessive–compulsive disorder|obsessive compulsive disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1037/a0029275 | volume=12 | title=Exploring the positive and negative implications of facial feedback. | journal=Emotion | pages=852–859}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[functional neuroimaging]] study, Andreas Hennenlotter and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hennenlotter, A. |author2=Dresel, C. |author3=Castrop, F. |author4=Ceballos Baumann, A. O. |author5=Wohlschlager, A.

During imitation of angry facial expressions, botox decreased activation of brain regions implicated in emotional processing and emotional experience (namely, the [[amygdala]] and the [[brainstem]]), relative to activations before botox injection.  These findings show that facial feedback modulates neural processing of emotional content, and that botox changes how the human brain responds to emotional situations.

In a study of cognitive processing of emotional content, David Havas and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Havas, D. A. |author2=Glenberg, A. M. |author3=Gutowski, K. A. |author4=Lucarelli, M. J. |author5= Davidson, R.

Reading times for angry and sad sentences were longer after botox injection than before injection, while reading times for happy sentences were unchanged.  This finding shows that facial muscle paralysis has a selective effect on processing of emotional content.  It also demonstrates that cosmetic use of botox affects aspects of human [[cognition]] - namely, the understanding of language.

In [[biblical cosmology]], the '''firmament''' is the structure above the [[atmosphere of Earth]], conceived as a vast solid [[dome]].&lt;ref name="NewAdvent"&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Firmament|noicon=x}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Genesis creation narrative]], [[God]] created the firmament to separate the "waters above" the [[earth]] from the "waters below" the earth.&lt;ref&gt;"And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters"{{cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/genesis/1-6.htm |title= Genesis 1:6 |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word is [[anglicisation|anglicized]] from the Latin ''firmamentum'', which appears in the [[Vulgate]], a late-[[4th century|4th-century]] [[Bible translations into Latin|Latin translation]] of the [[Bible]].

==Biblical use==
{{Main|Biblical cosmology}}
The firmament is described in {{bibleref2|Genesis|1:6–8|NKJV}} in the [[Genesis creation narrative]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Then God said, “Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.” Thus God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament; and it was so. And God called the firmament Heaven. So the evening and the morning were the second day.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|1:6–8|NKJV|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Etymology==
The word "firmament" is first recorded in a Middle English narrative based on scripture dated 1250.&lt;ref name=OED&gt;"firmament", ''Oxford English Dictionary'' (1989). "ðo god bad ben ðe  firmament". From ''[http://xtf.lib.virginia.edu/xtf/view?docId=chadwyck_ep%2FuvaGenText%2Ftei%2Fchep_1.2106.xml&amp;chunk.id= The story of Genesis and Exodus]'' (1250).&lt;/ref&gt; It later appeared in the [[Authorized King James Version|King James Bible]]. The word is [[anglicised]] from Latin ''firmamentum'', used in the [[Vulgate]] (4th century).&lt;ref name="etymol"/&gt; This in turn is derived from the Latin root ''firmus'', a cognate with "firm".&lt;ref name="etymol"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=firmament |title= Online Etymology Dictionary – Firmament |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word is a Latinization of the Greek ''[[wiktionary:στερέωμα|stereōma]]'', which appears in the [[Septuagint]] (c. 200 BCE).&lt;ref name="NewAdvent"/&gt;

==History==
{{Main|Hebrew astronomy#Biblical cosmology}}
[[File:Flammarion.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Flammarion engraving]] (1888) depicts a man crawling under the edge of the sky, depicted as if it were a solid hemisphere, to look at the mysterious [[Empyrean]] beyond. The caption underneath the engraving (not shown here) translates to "A medieval missionary tells that he has found the point where heaven and Earth meet..."]]

The word "firmament" is used to translate ''rāqîaʿ'' ({{Script/Hebrew|רָקִ֫יעַ}}), a word used in [[Biblical Hebrew]]. It is derived from the root ''raqqəʿ'' ({{lang|he|רָקַע}}), meaning "to beat or spread out thinly", e.g., the process of making a dish by hammering thin a lump of metal.&lt;ref name="etymol"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BlueLetter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cf.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?strongs=07549 |title= Lexicon Results Strong's H7549 – raqiya` |date= |work= Blue Letter Bible|publisher= Blue Letter Bible|accessdate=2009-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like most ancient peoples, the Hebrews believed the sky was a solid dome with the [[Sun]], [[Moon]], [[planets]] and [[stars]] embedded in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Westminster Theological Journal |volume= 53 |year= 1991 |pages= 227–40 |title= The Firmament and the Water Above |author= Seely, Paul H.
 |url= http://faculty.gordon.edu/hu/bi/Ted_Hildebrandt/OTeSources/01-Genesis/Text/Articles-Books/Seely-Firmament-WTJ.pdf |format= PDF |accessdate= 2010-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to The ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Hebrews regarded the earth as a plain or a hill figured like a hemisphere, swimming on water. Over this is arched the solid vault of heaven. To this vault are fastened the lights, the stars. So slight is this elevation that birds may rise to it and fly along its expanse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=807&amp;letter=C#2736 |title=Cosmogony |publisher=[[JewishEncyclopedia.com]] |date= |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A detailed Christian view of the universe, based on various Biblical texts and earlier theories by [[Theophilus of Antioch]] and [[Clement of Alexandria]], was formulated by the 6th century Egyptian monk, [[Cosmas Indicopleustes]]. He described a flat rectangular world surrounded by four seas; at the far edges of the seas, four immense vertical walls supported a vaulted roof, the firmament, above which in a further vaulted space lived angels who moved the heavenly bodies and controlled rainfall from a vast cistern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=White |first=Andrew Dickson |date=1896 |title=A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom: Volume 1 |url=https://archive.org/stream/historyofwarfare189701whit#page/92/mode/2up |location=New York |publisher=[[D. Appleton and Company]] |pages=91–92 |isbn= |author-link=Andrew Dickson White }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Augustine]] wrote that too much learning had been expended on the nature of the firmament.&lt;ref name="Grant"&gt;Grant, Edward, ''Planets, stars, and orbs: the medieval cosmos, 1200–1687''. p. 335.&lt;/ref&gt; "We may understand this name as given to indicate not it is motionless but that it is solid." he wrote.&lt;ref name="Grant"/&gt; [[Saint Basil]] argued for a fluid firmament.&lt;ref name="Grant"/&gt; According to St. [[Thomas Aquinas]], the firmament had a "solid nature" and stood above a "region of fire, wherein all vapor must be consumed."&lt;ref&gt;Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Summa Theologica'', "[http://christianbookshelf.org/aquinas/summa_theologica/whether_there_are_waters_above.htm Whether there are waters above the firmament?]"&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Copernican Revolution]] of the 16th century led to reconsideration of these matters. In 1554, [[John Calvin]] proposed that "firmament" be interpreted as clouds.&lt;ref name="Luigi"&gt;Luigi Piccardi, W. Bruce Masse, ''Myth and geology'', p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; "He who would learn astronomy and other recondite arts, let him go elsewhere," wrote Calvin.&lt;ref name="Luigi"/&gt; "As it became a theologian, [Moses] had to respect ''us'' rather than the stars," Calvin wrote. Calvin's [[Accommodation (religion)|doctrine of accommodation]] allowed Protestants to accept the findings of science [[John Calvin's view of Scripture|without rejecting the authority of scripture]].&lt;ref name="Luigi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="catholicencyc"&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06079b.htm Firmament], Catholic Encyclopedia.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific development==
{{main|Celestial spheres}}
The Greeks and [[Stoics]] adopted a model of [[celestial spheres]] after the discovery of the [[spherical Earth]] in the 4th to 3rd centuries BCE. The Medieval [[Scholastics]] adopted a cosmology that fused the ideas of the Greek philosophers [[Aristotle]] and [[Ptolemy]].&lt;ref&gt;Grant, p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt; This cosmology involved [[heavenly sphere|celestial orbs]], nested concentrically inside one another, with the earth at the center. The outermost [[Orb (astrology)|orb]] contained the stars and the term ''firmament'' was then transferred to this orb. There were seven inner orbs for the seven [[Classical planet|wanderers]] of the sky, and their ordering is preserved in the [[Week-day names|naming of the days]] of the week.

Even [[Copernicus]]' heliocentric model included an outer sphere that held the stars (and by having the earth rotate daily on its axis it allowed the firmament to be completely stationary). [[Tycho Brahe]]'s studies of the [[De Stella Nova|nova of 1572]] and the [[Comet of 1577]] were the first major challenges to the idea that orbs existed as solid, incorruptible, material objects.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, p. 348.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1584, [[Giordano Bruno]] proposed a cosmology without firmament: an infinite universe in which the stars are actually suns with their own planetary systems.&lt;ref&gt;Giordano Bruno, ''De l'infinito universo e mondi'' (On the Infinite Universe and Worlds), 1584.&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Galileo]] began using a [[telescope]] to examine the sky, it became harder to argue that the heavens were perfect, as Aristotelian philosophy required. By 1630, the concept of solid orbs was no longer dominant.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, p. 349.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7114">In the [[special theory of relativity]], '''four-force''' is a [[four-vector]] that replaces the classical [[force]].

== In special relativity ==
The four-force is defined as the rate of change in the [[four-momentum]] of a particle with respect to the particle's [[proper time]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = {d\mathbf{P} \over d\tau}&lt;/math&gt;.

For a particle of constant [[invariant mass]] &lt;math&gt;m &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P} = m\mathbf{U}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{U}=\gamma(c,\mathbf{u})&lt;/math&gt; is the [[four-velocity]], so we can relate the four-force with the [[four-acceleration]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; as in [[Newton's second law]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = m\mathbf{A} = \left(\gamma {\mathbf{f}\cdot\mathbf{u} \over c},\gamma{\mathbf f}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

Here

:&lt;math&gt;{\mathbf f}={d \over dt} \left(\gamma m {\mathbf u} \right)={d\mathbf{p} \over dt}&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{f}\cdot\mathbf{u}}={d \over dt} \left(\gamma mc^2 \right)={dE \over dt} .&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f}&lt;/math&gt; are [[3-space]] vectors describing the velocity and the momentum of the particle and the force acting on it respectively.

== Including thermodynamic interactions ==

From the formulae of the previous section it appears that the time component of the four-force is the power expended, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f}\cdot\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt;, apart from relativistic corrections &lt;math&gt;\gamma/c&lt;/math&gt;. This is only true in purely mechanical situations, when heat exchanges vanish or can be neglected.

If the full thermo-mechanical case, not only [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]], but also [[Heat (thermodynamics)|heat]] contributes to the change in energy, which is the time component of the [[Four-momentum|energy–momentum covector]]. The time component of the four-force includes in this case a heating rate &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;, besides the power &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f}\cdot\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=grotetal1966&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grot|first1=Richard A.|last2=Eringen|first2=A. Cemal|title=Relativistic continuum mechanics: Part I – Mechanics and thermodynamics|date=1966|journal=Int. J. Engng Sci.|volume=4|issue=6|pages=611–638, 664|doi=10.1016/0020-7225(66)90008-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that work and heat cannot be meaningfully separated, though, as they both carry inertia.&lt;ref name=eckart1940&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eckart|first1=Carl|title=The Thermodynamics of Irreversible Processes. III. Relativistic Theory of the Simple Fluid|date=1940|journal=Phys. Rev.|volume=58|issue=10|pages=919–924|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.58.919|bibcode=1940PhRv...58..919E}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fact extends also to contact forces, that is, to the [[Stress-energy_tensor| stress-energy-momentum tensor]]&lt;ref name=truesdelletal1960&gt;C. A. Truesdell, R. A. Toupin: ''The Classical Field Theories'' (in S. Flügge (ed.): ''Encyclopedia of Physics, Vol. III-1'', Springer 1960). §§152–154 and 288–289.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eckart1940 /&gt;.

Therefore, in thermo-mechanical situations the time component of the four-force is ''not'' proportional to the power &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f}\cdot\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt; but has a more generic expression, to be given case by case, which represents the supply of internal energy from the combination of work and heat,&lt;ref name=eckart1940 /&gt;&lt;ref name=grotetal1966 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maugin|first1=Gérard A.|title=On the covariant equations of the relativistic electrodynamics of continua. I. General equations|date=1978|journal=J. Math. Phys.|volume=19|issue=5|pages=1198–1205|doi=10.1063/1.523785|bibcode=1978JMP....19.1198M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=truesdelletal1960 /&gt; and which in the Newtonian limit becomes &lt;math&gt;h + \mathbf{f}\cdot\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt;.

== In general relativity ==
In [[general relativity]] the relation between four-force, and [[four-acceleration]] remains the same, but the elements of the four-force are related to the elements of the [[four-momentum]] through a [[covariant derivative]] with respect to proper time.

:&lt;math&gt;F^\lambda := \frac{DP^\lambda }{d\tau} = \frac{dP^\lambda }{d\tau } + \Gamma^\lambda {}_{\mu \nu}U^\mu P^\nu &lt;/math&gt;

In addition, we can formulate force using the concept of [[coordinate transformation]]s between different coordinate systems. Assume that we know the correct expression for force in a coordinate system at which the particle is momentarily at rest. Then we can perform a transformation to another system to get the corresponding expression of force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Steven|first1=Weinberg|title=Gravitation and Cosmology: Principles and Applications of the General Theory of Relativity|date=1972|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|isbn=0-471-92567-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[special relativity]] the transformation will be a Lorentz transformation between coordinate systems moving with a relative constant velocity whereas in [[general relativity]] it will be a general coordinate transformation.

Consider the four-force &lt;math&gt;F^\mu=(F^0, \mathbf{F})&lt;/math&gt; acting on a particle of mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; which is momentarily at rest in a coordinate system. The relativistic force &lt;math&gt;f^\mu &lt;/math&gt; in another coordinate system moving with constant velocity &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, relative to the other one, is obtained using a Lorentz transformation:

&lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{f}}={\mathbf{F}}+(\gamma-1) {\mathbf{v}} { {\mathbf{v}}\cdot{\mathbf{F}}   \over v^2},&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;f^0=\gamma \boldsymbol{\beta}\cdot\mathbf{F}=\boldsymbol{\beta}\cdot\mathbf{f}.&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\beta}=\mathbf{v}/c&lt;/math&gt;.

In [[general relativity]], the expression for force becomes

&lt;math&gt;f^\mu=m {DU^\mu\over d\tau}&lt;/math&gt;

with [[covariant derivative]] &lt;math&gt;D/d\tau&lt;/math&gt;. The equation of motion becomes

&lt;math&gt;m {d^2 x^\mu\over d\tau^2}=f^\mu-m \Gamma^\mu_{\nu\lambda} {dx^\nu\over d\tau} {dx^\lambda\over d\tau},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;  \Gamma^\mu_{\nu\lambda} &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Christoffel symbol]]. If there is no external force, this becomes the equation for [[geodesic]]s in the [[curved space-time]]. The second term in the above equation, plays the role of a gravitational force. If &lt;math&gt; f^\alpha_f &lt;/math&gt; is the correct expression for force in a freely falling frame &lt;math&gt; \xi^\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, we can use then the [[equivalence principle]] to write the four-force in an arbitrary coordinate &lt;math&gt; x^\mu&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;f^\mu={ \partial x^\mu \over \partial \xi^\alpha } f^\alpha_f.&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples==
In special relativity, [[Lorentz force|Lorentz four-force]] (four-force acting to charged particle situated in electromagnetic field) can be expressed as:
:&lt;math&gt;F_\mu = qF_{\mu\nu}U^\nu&lt;/math&gt;,

where 
* &lt;math&gt;F_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[electromagnetic tensor]],
* &lt;math&gt;U^\nu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[four-velocity]], and
* &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is the [[electric charge]].

==The Holmes–Pitezel Case==
[[H H Holmes]]'s recorded crimes began in Chicago in 1893 when he opened a hotel called The World's Fair Hotel for the [[World's Columbian Exposition]]. The structure, built by Holmes, would later be known as the 'Murder Castle' because of the labyrinthine constructions on the top two floors, which he used to torture and kill many of his victims. In a 1937 article, the [[Chicago Tribune]] described: "There were rooms that had no doors. There were doors that had no rooms. A mysterious house it was indeed -- a crooked house, a reflex of the builder's own distorted mind. In that house occurred dark and eerie deeds."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-serial-killer-white-city-flashback-1026-20141025-story.html#page=1 | last =Benzkofer | first =Stephan | date = October 24, 2014 | title =Chicago's first serial killer | newspaper =[[The Chicago Tribune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boston police inspectors and a Pinkerton detective apprehended Holmes in 1894 in Boston on a coroner's warrant for insurance fraud perpetrated in Philadelphia; however, Boston officials did not find the warrant sufficient to hold Holmes so they contacted Fort Worth, Texas for an outstanding warrant of horse theft. Holmes volunteered to be extradited to Philadelphia for the insurance fraud as he felt he would receive a much lighter sentence. Texas was notorious for rendering harsh sentences to horse thieves. The City of Philadelphia Police Department sent Detective Thomas Crawford to Boston to bring H. H. Holmes and his accomplice, Mrs. Carrie Pitezel, to Philadelphia for a trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Holmes-Pitezel case: a history of the greatest crime of the century and of the search for the missing Pitezel children|last=Geyer|first=Frank P.|publisher=Publishers' Union|year=1896|isbn=|location=Philadelphia, PA|pages=143–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Detective in the White City: The Real Story of Frank Geyer|last=Crighton|first=JD|publisher=RW Publishing House|year=2017|isbn=978-1-946100-02-3|location=Murrieta, CA|pages=138–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=The Holmes Case|last=|first=|date=August 3, 1895|work=Decatur Daily Republican|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philadelphia city detective Frank Geyer was tasked with investigating and the trail led him through the Mid West and Toronto, Canada, where he found the remains of two of the Pitezel children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://torontoist.com/2014/09/historicist-h-h-holmes-in-toronto | title=Historicist: H.H. Holmes in Toronto | publisher=[[Torontoist]] | author=David Wencer | accessdate=November 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were the children of Benjamin Pitezel, Holmes's former partner in crime, which he had murdered to commit life insurance fraud. Pitezel, however, was only involved in fraud and had no knowledge of the murders.

The initial investigation was concerned with the insurance fraud but it soon became apparent that Holmes killed Pitezel. In June 1895 Frank Geyer left Philadelphia to retrace Holmes's steps. His findings in Toronto led to further investigations of Holmes's Chicago property, which sealed his fate. Geyer used information from the unsent letters written by the Pitezel children which, for an unknown reason, were kept by Holmes. In Toronto, he found the bodies of Alice and Nellie Pitezel. He continued his search and found the burnt remains of Howard Pitezel, the third child, in a house Holmes had rented in Irvington, Indianapolis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.allthingscrimeblog.com/2014/03/28/the-monstrous-h-h-holmes-and-his-murder-castle-inc | title=The Monstrous H.H.

Holmes was found guilty of four counts of murder in the first degree and six counts of attempted murder and executed in May 1896 at the age of 34. His total number of victims is estimated at around 200.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.harpers.org/archive/1943/12/0020617 | title=The Master of Murder Castle: A Classic of Chicago Crime | publisher=''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' | author=John Bartlow Martin | authorlink = John Bartlow Martin | origyear=First published in 1943 | accessdate=November 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other Work by Detective Geyer ==
In 1896, Detective Geyer became an author and inventor. He authored the '' Holmes-Pitezel case: a history of the greatest crime of the century and of the search for the missing Pitezel children'', which became an instant best seller. Shortly after its release, his "Shutter or Door Fastener" patent application was approved by the United States Patent Office on March 10, 1896, Patent No. 556,141. After 27 years with the City of Philadelphia Police Department, Geyer opened the Frank P. Geyer Detective Agency, located at 1328 Arch Street in Philadelphia and investigated high profile cases, mostly in the Pennsylvania and New Jersey areas. In 1907, he invented the "Safety-Lock for Pocket Books and Hand Bags, which was approved by the Patent Office December 3, 1907, Patent No. 872,619.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Detective in the White City: The Real Story of Frank Geyer|last=Crighton|first=JD|publisher=RW Publishing House|year=2017|isbn=978-1-946100-02-3|location=Murrieta, CA|pages=210–14, 242–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Geyer Detective Agency Ad|last=|first=|date=September 13, 1908|work=Philadelphia Inquirer|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Miscellaneous Bills [Bucks County paid Detective Geyer for services]|last=|first=|date=January 26, 1916|work=The Central News|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Fake Mustaches|last=|first=|date=September 6, 1909|work=Wilkes-Barre Times|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Strong Murderer Declares Medium|last=|first=|date=March 29, 1911|work=Philadelphia Inquirer|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[rocket]]s were used as propulsion systems for [[arrows]], and may have appeared as early as the 10th century [[Song dynasty]] [[China]]. However more solid documentary evidence does not appear until the 13th century. The technology probably spread across [[Eurasia]] in the wake of the [[Mongol invasions]] of the mid-13th century. Usage of rockets as weapons before modern rocketry is attested in [[China]], [[Korea]], [[Indian subcontinent]], and [[Europe]]. One of the first recorded [[rocket launcher]]s is the "wasp nest" fire arrow launcher produced by the [[Ming dynasty]] in 1380. In Europe rockets were also used in the same year at the [[Battle of Chioggia]]. The [[Joseon]] kingdom of Korea used a type of mobile [[multiple rocket launcher]] known as the "Munjong [[Hwacha]]" by 1451. Iron-cased rockets, known as [[Mysorean rockets]], were developed in [[Kingdom of Mysore]] by the mid 18th century in India,&lt;ref name="Riper2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=A. Bowdoin Van Riper|title=Rockets and Missiles: The Life Story of a Technology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k8CxJeFzCdQC&amp;pg=PA14|date=29 October 2007|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-0-8018-8792-5|pages=14–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were later copied by the [[British people|British]]. The later models and improvements were known as the [[Congreve rocket]] and used in the [[Napoleonic Wars]].

Use of liquid propellants instead of gunpowder greatly improved the effectiveness of rocket artillery in World War I, and opened up the possibility of [[manned spaceflight]] after 1918.

==China==
{{see also|Timeline of the Gunpowder Age}}

The dating of the invention of the first rocket, otherwise known as the gunpowder propelled [[fire arrow]], is disputed. The [[History of Song]] attributes the invention to two different people at different times, [[Feng Zhisheng]] in 969 and [[Tang Fu]] in 1000. However [[Joseph Needham]] argues that rockets could not have existed befoire the 12th century, since the gunpowder formulas listed in the [[Wujing Zongyao]] are not suitable as rocket propellant.{{sfn|Lorge|2005}}

Rockets may have been used as early as 1232, when reports appeared describing fire arrows and 'iron pots' that could be heard for 5 [[League (unit)|leagues]] (25&amp;nbsp;km, or 15 miles) when they exploded upon impact, causing devastation for a radius of {{convert|600|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}}, apparently due to [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|shrapnel]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solarviews.com/eng/rocket.htm|title=A Brief History of Rocketry |publisher=Solarviews.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rockets are recorded to have been used by the Song navy in a military exercise dated to 1245. Internal-combustion rocket propulsion is mentioned in a reference to 1264, recording that the 'ground-rat,' a type of [[firework]], had  frightened the Empress-Mother Gongsheng at a feast held in her honor by her son the [[Emperor Lizong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Crosby | first = Alfred W. | title = Throwing Fire: Projectile Technology Through History | year = 2002 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge | isbn = 0-521-79158-8 | pages = 100–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, rockets are included in the military treatise ''[[Huolongjing]]'', also known as the Fire Drake Manual, written by the Chinese artillery officer [[Jiao Yu]] in the mid-14th century. This text mentions the first known [[multistage rocket]], the 'fire-dragon issuing from the water' (huo long chu shui), thought to have been used by the Chinese navy.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 510"&gt;Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 510.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rocket launchers known as "wasp nests" were ordered by the Ming army in 1380.{{sfn|Needham|1986|p=514}}

The American historian [[Frank H. Winter]] proposed in ''The Proceedings of the Twentieth and Twenty-First History Symposia of the International Academy of Astronautics'' that southern China and the [[Laos|Laotian]] community [[Rocket Festival|rocket festivals]] might have been key in the subsequent spread of rocketry in the Orient.&lt;ref&gt;Frank H. Winter, "The `Boun Bang Fai' Rockets of Thailand and Laos:", in Lloyd H. Cornett, Jr., ed., History of Rocketry and Astronautics - Proceedings of the Twentieth and Twenty-First History Symposia of the International Academy of Astronautics, AAS History Series, Vol. 15 (Univelt Inc.: San Diego, 1993), pp. 3-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spread of rocket technology==

The Chinese fire arrow was adopted by the Mongols in northern China, who employed Chinese rocketry experts as [[mercenaries]] in the Mongol army. Rockets are thought to have spread via the [[Mongol invasions]] to other areas of Eurasia in the mid 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;"Rockets appear in Arab literature in 1258 A.D., describing Mongol invaders' use of them on February 15 to capture the city of Baghdad." {{cite web|url=http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/history/rocket-history.txt|title=A brief history of rocketry|work=NASA Spacelink |accessdate=2006-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
In Europe, [[Roger Bacon]] mentions gunpowder in his ''[[Opus Majus]]'' of 1267.{{sfn|Kelly|2004|p=25}}

However rockets do not feature in European warfare until the 1380 [[Battle of Chioggia]].{{sfn|Needham|1986|p=516}}

[[Konrad Kyeser]] described rockets in his famous military treatise [[Bellifortis]] around 1405.&lt;ref name="bellifortis"&gt;"Rockets and Missiles: The Life Story of a Technology", A. Bowdoin Van Riper, p.10&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean Froissart]] (c. 1337 – c. 1405) had the idea of launching rockets through tubes, so that they could make more accurate flights. Froissart's idea is a forerunner of the modern [[bazooka]].&lt;ref name="nasa"/&gt;

==Adoption in Renaissance-era Europe==
[[File:Conrad Kyeser's Bellifortis c 1405 fig 1.jpg|thumb|Depiction of a rocket in Kyeser's ''[[Bellifortis]]'' (1405)]]

According to the 18th-century historian [[Ludovico Antonio Muratori]], rockets were used in the [[war of Chioggia|war between the Republics of Genoa and Venice]] at Chioggia in 1380. It is uncertain whether Muratori was correct in his interpretation, as the reference might also have been to [[Bombard (weapon)|bombard]], but
Muratori is the source for the widespread claim that the earliest recorded European use of rocket artillery dates to 1380.&lt;ref&gt;Ley, ''Geschichte der Rakete'', 1932.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Konrad Kyeser]] described rockets in his famous military treatise [[Bellifortis]] around 1405.&lt;ref name="bellifortis"/&gt;
Kyeser describes three types of rockets, swimming, free flying and [[Captive plane|captive]].

[[Joanes de Fontana]] in ''Bellicorum instrumentorum liber'' (c. 1420) described flying rockets in the shape of doves, running rockets in the shape of hares, and a large car driven by three rockets, as well as a large rocket torpedo with the head of a sea monster.

In the mid-16th century, [[Conrad Haas]] wrote a book that described rocket technology that combined [[fireworks]] and weapons technologies. This manuscript was discovered in 1961, in the [[Sibiu]] public records (Sibiu public records ''Varia II 374''). His work dealt with the theory of motion of multi-stage rockets, different fuel mixtures using [[liquid fuel]], and introduced [[delta (letter)|delta]]-shape [[fin]]s and bell-shaped [[nozzle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sibiweb.de/vip/haas/ |title=CONRAD HAAS Raketenpionier in Siebenbürgen (german) |publisher=Sibiweb.de |date= |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''Rocket'' comes from the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''rocchetta'', meaning "bobbin" or "little spindle",&lt;ref&gt;a diminutive of ''rocca'' "[[distaff]]", itself from a [[:wikt:Appendix:Proto-Germanic/rukkô|Germanic source]].&lt;/ref&gt; given due to the similarity in shape to the bobbin or spool used to hold the thread to be fed to a spinning wheel. The Italian term was adopted into German in the mid 16th century, by [[Leonhard Fronsperger]] in a book on rocket artillery published in 1557, using the spelling ''rogete'', and by [[Conrad Haas]] as ''rackette''; adoption into English dates to ca. 1610.&lt;ref&gt;English ''rocket'' from c. 1610, adopted from the Italian term. Jim Bernhard, ''Porcupine, Picayune, &amp; Post: How Newspapers Get Their Names'' (2007), [https://books.google.com/books?id=_oO5fWi6dikC&amp;pg=PA126 p. 126].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johann Schmidlap]], a German fireworks maker, is believed to have experimented with staging in 1590.

==Early modern history==
''Lagari Hasan Çelebi'' was a legendary [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] aviator who, according to an account written by [[Evliya Çelebi]], made a successful manned rocket [[flight]]. Evliya Çelebi purported that in 1633 [[Lagari Hasan Çelebi]] launched in a 7-winged rocket using 50 okka (63.5&amp;nbsp;kg, or 140&amp;nbsp;lbs) of [[gunpowder]] from [[Sarayburnu]], the point below [[Topkapı Palace]] in [[Istanbul]].

"''Artis Magnae Artilleriae pars prima''" ("Great Art of Artillery, the First Part", also known as "The Complete Art of Artillery"), first printed in [[Amsterdam]] in 1650, was translated to [[French language|French]] in 1651, [[German language|German]] in 1676, English and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] in 1729 and [[Polish language|Polish]] in 1963. For over two centuries, this work of [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] [[szlachta|nobleman]] [[Kazimierz Siemienowicz]]&lt;ref name="Nowak182"&gt;Tadeusz Nowak "''Kazimierz Siemienowicz, ca.1600-ca.1651''", MON Press, [[Warsaw]] 1969, p.182&lt;/ref&gt; was used in Europe as a basic artillery manual. The book provided the standard designs for creating rockets, fireballs, and other [[pyrotechnic]] devices. It contained a large chapter on caliber, construction, production and properties of rockets (for both military and civil purposes), including [[Multistage rocket|multi-stage]] rockets, batteries of rockets, and rockets with [[delta wing]] [[Stabilizer (aircraft)|stabilizer]]s (instead of the common guiding rods).

In 1792, the first [[Mysorean Rockets|iron-cased rockets]] were successfully developed and used by Mysorean rulers of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]] in [[India]] against the larger [[British East India Company]] forces during the [[Anglo-Mysore Wars]]. The British then took an active interest in the technology and developed it further during the 19th century. The Mysore rockets of this period were much more advanced than the British had previously seen, chiefly because of the use of iron tubes for holding the propellant; this enabled higher thrust and longer range for the missile (up to 2&amp;nbsp;km range). After Tipu's eventual defeat in the [[Fourth Anglo-Mysore War]] and the capture of the Mysore iron rockets, they were influential in British rocket development, inspiring the [[Congreve rocket]], which was soon put into use in the [[Napoleonic Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;Roddam Narasimha (1985).

[[File:Congreve rockets.gif|thumb|300px|The [[Congreve rocket]]]]
[[William Congreve (inventor)|William Congreve]], son of the Comptroller of the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, London, became a major figure in the field. From 1801, Congreve researched on the original design of [[Mysorean Rockets|Mysore rockets]] and set on a vigorous development program at the Arsenal's laboratory.&lt;ref name="congreve"&gt;{{harvnb|Stephens|1887}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congreve prepared a new propellant mixture, and developed a rocket motor with a strong iron tube with conical nose. This early [[Congreve rocket]] weighed about 32 pounds (14.5 kilograms). The Royal Arsenal's first demonstration of solid fuel rockets was in 1805. The rockets were effectively used during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and the [[War of 1812]]. Congreve published three books on rocketry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Van Riper|2004}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From there, the use of military rockets spread throughout the western world. At the [[Battle of Baltimore]] in 1814, the rockets fired on [[Fort McHenry]] by the [[rocket vessel]] [[HMS Erebus (1807)|HMS ''Erebus'']] were the source of the ''rockets' red glare'' described by [[Francis Scott Key]] in [[The Star-Spangled Banner]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/hh/5/hh5l.htm British Rockets] at the US National Park Service, Fort McHenry National Monument and Historic Shrine. Retrieved February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Rockets were also used in the [[Battle of Waterloo]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20010306020430/http://napoleonic-literature.com/Articles/Rockets/History_of_Rockets.htm History of the Rocket - 1804 to 1815] by Gareth Glover&lt;/ref&gt;

Early rockets were very inaccurate. Without the use of spinning or any controlling [[feedback loop]], rockets had a strong tendency to veer sharply off of their intended course. The early [[Mysorean rockets]] and their successor British [[Congreve rocket]]s&lt;ref name="congreve"/&gt; reduced this somewhat by attaching a long stick to the end of a rocket (similar to modern bottle rockets) to make it harder for the rocket to change course. The largest of the Congreve rockets was the 32-pound (14.5&amp;nbsp;kg) Carcass, which had a 15-foot (4.6 m) stick. Originally, sticks were mounted on the side, but this was later changed to mounting in the center of the rocket, reducing drag and enabling the rocket to be more accurately fired from a segment of pipe.

In 1815, [[Alexander Dmitrievich Zasyadko]] began his work on creating military gunpowder rockets. He constructed rocket-launching platforms, which allowed rockets to be fired in salvos (6 rockets at a time), and gun-laying devices. Zasyadko elaborated a tactic for military use of rocket weaponry. In 1820, Zasyadko was appointed head of the Petersburg Armory, Okhtensky Powder Factory, pyrotechnic laboratory and the first Highest Artillery School in Russia. He organized rocket production in a special rocket workshop and created the first rocket sub-unit in the Russian army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1987/MAF.htm |title=Marine Corps Artillery Rockets: Back Through The Future |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artillery captain [[Józef Bem]] of the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]] started experiments with what was then called in Polish ''raca kongrewska''. These culminated in his 1819 report ''Notes sur les fusees incendiares'' (German edition: ''Erfahrungen über die Congrevischen Brand-Raketen bis zum Jahre 1819 in der Königlischen Polnischen Artillerie gesammelt'', Weimar 1820). The research took place in the [[Warsaw Arsenal]], where captain Józef Kosiński also developed the multiple-rocket launchers adapted from [[horse artillery]] [[gun carriage]]. The 1st Rocketeer Corps was formed in 1822, it first saw combat during the [[Polish–Russian War 1830–31]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Szczygielska |first1=Małgorzata |title=Rakietnicy konni Królestwa Polskiego |url=http://www.ksopit.pl/sladami_kopyt/legendarne_formacje_kawalerii/rakietnicy |accessdate=25 March 2016 |language=pl |date=2013 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The accuracy problem was greatly improved in 1844 when [[William Hale (British inventor)|William Hale]]&lt;ref name="SMITH"&gt;{{harvnb|Space History Division|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; modified the rocket design so that thrust was slightly [[thrust vectoring|vectored]], causing the rocket to spin along its axis of travel like a bullet. The Hale rocket removed the need for a rocket stick, travelled further due to reduced air resistance, and was far more accurate.

In 1865 the British Colonel [[Edward Mounier Boxer]] built an improved version of the Congreve rocket placing two rockets in one tube, one behind the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freespace.virgin.net/iw.history/rockets/dennett.htm|title=John Dennett: Isle of Wight Rocket Man|work=virgin.net|accessdate=7 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823210111/http://freespace.virgin.net/iw.history/rockets/dennett.htm|archivedate=23 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early 20th-century rocket pioneers==
[[File:Tsiolkovsky.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]] published the first work on space travel, which was inspired by [[Russian cosmism]] and the writings of [[Jules Verne]].]]
At the beginning of the 20th century, there was a burst of scientific investigation into interplanetary travel, largely driven by the inspiration of fiction by writers such as [[Jules Verne]] and [[H. G. Wells]] as well as [[philosophy|philosophical movements]] like [[Russian cosmism]]. Scientists seized on the rocket as a technology that was able to achieve this in real life, a possibility first recognized in 1861 by [[William Leitch (scientist)|William Leitch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cgpublishing.com/prime/bookpages/9781926837369.html|title=William Leitch Presbyterian Scientist|work=apogeebooks.com|accessdate=22 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1903, high school mathematics teacher [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]] (1857–1935), inspired by Verne and [[Russian cosmism|Cosmism]], published ''Исследование мировых пространств реактивными приборами''&lt;ref&gt;[http://epizodsspace.testpilot.ru/bibl/dorev-knigi/ciolkovskiy/issl-03st.html Tsiolkovsky's Исследование мировых пространств реактивными приборами - ''The Exploration of Cosmic Space by Means of Reaction Devices'' (Russian paper)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081019234511/http://epizodsspace.testpilot.ru/bibl/dorev-knigi/ciolkovskiy/issl-03st.html |date=2008-10-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (''The Exploration of Cosmic Space by Means of Reaction Devices''), the first serious scientific work on space travel. The [[Tsiolkovsky rocket equation]]—the principle that governs rocket propulsion—is named in his honor (although it had been discovered previously).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|1995|pp=499–521}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also advocated the use of liquid hydrogen and oxygen for propellant, calculating their maximum exhaust velocity. His work was essentially unknown outside the Soviet Union, but inside the country it inspired further research, experimentation and the formation of the [[Society for Studies of Interplanetary Travel]] in 1924.

[[File:Robert Esnault-Pelterie 1909.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Robert Esnault-Pelterie]] (1909).]]
In 1912, [[Robert Esnault-Pelterie]] published a lecture&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Esnault-Pelterie|1913}}&lt;/ref&gt; on rocket theory and interplanetary travel. He independently derived Tsiolkovsky's rocket equation, did basic calculations about the energy required to make round trips to the Moon and planets, and he proposed the use of atomic power (i.e. radium) to power a jet drive.

[[File:Dr. Robert H. Goddard - GPN-2002-000131.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Robert H. Goddard|Robert Goddard]]]]
In 1912 [[Robert Goddard (scientist)|Robert Goddard]], inspired from an early age by H.G. Wells, began a serious analysis of rockets, concluding that conventional solid-fuel rockets needed to be improved in three ways. First, fuel should be burned in a small combustion chamber, instead of building the entire propellant container to withstand the high pressures. Second, rockets could be arranged in stages. Finally, the exhaust speed (and thus the efficiency) could be greatly increased to beyond the speed of sound by using a [[De Laval nozzle]]. He patented these concepts in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=1,102,653.PN.&amp;OS=PN/1,102,653&amp;RS=PN/1,102,653 |title=US patent 1,102,653 |publisher=Patft.uspto.gov |date=1914-07-07 |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also independently developed the mathematics of rocket flight.

During World War I [[Yves Le Prieur]], a French naval officer and inventor, later to create a pioneering [[scuba diving]] apparatus, developed air-to-air solid-fuel rockets. The aim was to destroy observation captive balloons (called saucisses or Drachens) used by German artillery. These rather crude black powder, steel-tipped incendiary rockets (made by [[Ruggieri]]{{clarify |date=January 2018 |reason=unclear which "Ruggeri" we're talking about}}) were first tested from a [[Voisin (aircraft)|Voisin aircraft]], wing-bolted on a fast [[Pic-Pic|Picard Pictet]] sports car and then used in battle on real aircraft. A typical layout was eight electrically fired Le Prieur rockets fitted on the interpane struts of a [[Nieuport]] aircraft. If fired at sufficiently short distance, a spread of [[Le Prieur rocket]]s proved to be quite deadly. Belgian ace Willy Coppens claimed dozens of Drachen kills during World War I.

In 1920, Goddard published these ideas and experimental results in ''[[A Method of Reaching Extreme Altitudes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goddard|1919}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work included remarks about sending a solid-fuel rocket to the Moon, which attracted worldwide attention and was both praised and ridiculed. A ''New York Times'' editorial suggested:
: "That Professor Goddard, with his 'chair' in Clark College and the countenancing of the Smithsonian Institution, does not know the relation of action to reaction, and of the need to have something better than a vacuum against which to react -- to say that would be absurd. Of course he only seems to lack the knowledge ladled out daily in high {{nowrap|schools."{{ns}}—''New York Times'', 13 January 1920&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first= |last= |authorlink= |title=Topics of the Times |url=http://it.is.rice.edu/~rickr/goddard.editorial.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209230323/http://it.is.rice.edu/~rickr/goddard.editorial.html |archivedate=2008-02-09 |publisher=New York Times |date=January 13, 1920 |accessdate=2007-06-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1923, [[Hermann Oberth]] (1894–1989) published ''Die Rakete zu den Planetenräumen'' ("The Rocket into Planetary Space"), a version of his doctoral thesis, after the University of Munich had rejected it.&lt;ref name="ianzer"&gt;Jürgen Heinz Ianzer, [http://www.aspera.ro/dl/oberth.pdf ''Hermann Oberth, pǎrintele zborului cosmic''] ("Hermann Oberth, Father of Cosmic Flight") (in Romanian), pp. 3, 11, 13, 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924, Tsiolkovsky also wrote about [[multi-stage rocket]]s, in 'Cosmic Rocket Trains'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=inventors |url=http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blrocketTsiolkovsky.htm |title=Konstantin Tsiolkovsky - Rockets from Russia |publisher=Inventors.about.com |date=2012-04-09 |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern rocketry==
===Pre-World War II===
[[File:Goddard and Rocket.jpg|thumb|upright|Robert Goddard and the first liquid-fueled rocket.]]

Modern rockets originated when Goddard attached a supersonic ([[de Laval nozzle|de Laval]]) nozzle to the combustion chamber of a liquid-fueled rocket engine. These nozzles turn the hot gas from the combustion chamber into a cooler, [[hypersonic]], highly directed jet of gas, more than doubling the thrust and raising the engine efficiency from 2% to 64%.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goddard|2002|pp=2,15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Clary|2003|pp=44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 March 1926 Robert Goddard launched the world's first liquid-fueled rocket in [[Auburn, Massachusetts|Auburn]], Massachusetts.

During the 1920s, a number of rocket research organizations appeared worldwide. In 1927 the German car manufacturer [[Opel]] began to research rocket vehicles together with Mark Valier and the solid-fuel rocket builder Friedrich Wilhelm Sander.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/O/Opel-RAK.html |title=The Internet Encyclopedia of Science, history of rocketry: Opel-RAK |publisher=Daviddarling.info|accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928, Fritz von Opel drove a rocket car, the [[Opel-RAK]].1 on the Opel raceway in Rüsselsheim, Germany. In 1928 the [[Lippisch Ente]] flew: rocket power launched the manned glider, although it was destroyed on its second flight. In 1929 von Opel started at the Frankfurt-Rebstock airport with the [[Opel RAK.1|Opel-Sander RAK 1-airplane]], which was damaged beyond repair during a hard landing after its first flight.

In the mid-1920s, [[Weimar Republic|German]] scientists had begun experimenting with rockets that used liquid propellants capable of reaching relatively high altitudes and distances. In 1927 and also in Germany, a team of amateur rocket engineers had formed the ''[[Verein für Raumschiffahrt]]'' (Society for Space Travel, or VfR), and in 1931 launched a liquid propellant rocket (using [[oxygen]] and [[petrol|gasoline]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/V/Verein_fur_Raumschiffahrt.html |title=History of Rocketry: Verein für Raumschiffahrt (VfR) |publisher=Daviddarling.info |date=2007-02-01 |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rocketry in the [[Soviet Union]] also began with amateur societies, foremost was the Group for the Study of Reactive Propulsion (GIRD) headed by [[Friedrich Zander]] and [[Sergei Korolev]]. From 1931 to 1937 in the Soviet Union, extensive scientific work on rocket engine design occurred at the Gas Dynamics Laboratory (GDL) in [[Leningrad]], which was merged with GIRD in 1933 bringing rocketry fully under government control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amateur Rocketry Takes Flight |last=Gray |first=Dale M|url=http://www.i55mall.com/Frontier/spacepolicyarticles |publisher=Frontier Historical Consultants |access-date=19 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The well-funded and -staffed laboratory built over 100 experimental engines under the direction of [[Valentin Glushko]]. The work included [[regenerative cooling (rocket)|regenerative cooling]], [[hypergolic propellant]] ignition, and [[fuel injector]] designs that included swirling and bi-propellant mixing injectors. However, Glushko's arrest during [[Great Purge|Stalinist purges]] in 1938 curtailed the development.

Similar work was also done from 1932 onwards by the Austrian professor [[Eugen Sänger]], who migrated from Austria to Germany in 1936. He worked there on rocket-powered [[spaceplanes]] such as [[Silbervogel]] (sometimes called the "antipodal" bomber).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/data/saenger.pdf |title=A Rocket Drive For Long Range Bombers by E. Saenger and J. Bredt, August 1944 |format=PDF|accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 12, 1932 at a farm in Stockton NJ, the American Interplanetary Society's attempt to static-fire their first rocket (based on German Rocket Society designs) failed in a fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Winter| first1 = Frank H | last2 = van der Linden| first2 = Robert | title = Out of the Past | magazine = Aerospace America |date = November 2007|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, a British research programme based at [[Fort Halstead]] under the direction of Dr [[Alwyn Crow]] started work on a series of unguided [[solid-fuel rocket]]s that could be used as [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft weapon]]s. In 1939, a number of test firings were carried out in the [[British colony]] of [[Jamaica]], on a purpose built range.&lt;ref&gt;Edgerton, David (2012), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZQPhjvitv5IC&amp;pg=PA42 ''Britain's War Machine: Weapons, Resources, and Experts in the Second World War''] Penguin Books, {{ISBN|978-0141026107}} (p. 42)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s, the German ''[[Reichswehr]]'' (which in 1935 became the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'') began to take an interest in rocketry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zaloga|2003|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artillery restrictions imposed by the 1919 [[Treaty of Versailles]] limited Germany's access to long-distance weaponry. Seeing the possibility of using rockets as long-range [[artillery]] fire, the Wehrmacht initially funded the VfR team, but because their focus was strictly scientific, created its own research team. At the behest of military leaders, [[Wernher von Braun]], at the time a young aspiring [[rocket scientist]], joined the military (followed by two former VfR members) and developed long-range weapons for use in [[World War II]] by [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/a4.html|title=The V-2 ballistic missile |publisher=Russianspaceweb.com|accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===
[[File:V-2 Rocket On Meillerwagen.jpg|thumb|upright|A German V-2 rocket on a [[Meillerwagen]].]]
[[File:V-2 rocket diagram (with English labels).svg|thumb|upright|Layout of a [[V-2 rocket]].]]

At the start of the war, the British had equipped their warships with [[unrotated projectile]] unguided anti-aircraft rockets, and by 1940, the Germans had developed a surface-to-surface [[multiple rocket launcher]], the ''[[Nebelwerfer]]'' and the Soviets already had introduced the [[RS-132]] air-to-ground rocket. All of these rockets were developed for a variety of roles, notably the [[Katyusha rocket launcher|Katyusha rocket]].

In 1943, production of the [[V-2 rocket]] began in Germany. It had an operational range of {{convert|300|km|mi|abbr=on}} and carried a {{convert|1000|kg|lb|abbr=on}} warhead, with an [[amatol]] explosive charge. It normally achieved an operational maximum altitude of around {{convert|90|km|mi|abbr=on}}, but could achieve {{convert|206|km|mi|abbr=on}} if launched vertically. The vehicle was similar to most modern rockets, with [[turbopump]]s, [[guidance system|inertial guidance]] and many other features. Thousands were fired at various [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] nations, mainly Belgium, as well as England and France. While they could not be intercepted, their guidance system design and single conventional warhead meant that they were insufficiently accurate against military targets. A total of 2,754 people in England were killed, and 6,523 were wounded before the launch campaign was ended. There were also 20,000 deaths of slave labour during the construction of V-2s. While it did not significantly affect the course of the war, the V-2 provided a lethal demonstration of the potential for guided rockets as weapons.&lt;ref name=Hunt&gt;{{harvnb|Hunt|1991|pp=72–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Beon&gt;{{harvnb|Béon|1997}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In parallel with the guided missile programme in [[Nazi Germany]], rockets were also used on aircraft, either for assisting horizontal take-off ([[JATO|RATO]]), vertical take-off ([[Bachem Ba 349]] "Natter") or for powering them ([[Me 163]],&lt;ref name="ww2-planes"&gt;[http://www.world-war-2-planes.com/Messerschmitt-Me-163-Komet.html "Messerschmitt Me 163 Komet."] ''World War 2 Planes''. Retrieved: 22 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; etc.). During the war Germany also developed several guided and unguided air-to-air, ground-to-air and ground-to-ground missiles (see [[list of World War II guided missiles of Germany]]).

&lt;/gallery&gt;
At the end of World War II, competing Russian, British, and US military and scientific crews raced to capture technology and trained personnel from the German rocket program at [[Peenemünde]]. Russia and Britain had some success, but the [[United States]] benefited the most. The US captured a large number of German rocket scientists, including von Braun, and brought them to the [[United States]] as part of [[Operation Paperclip]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/iwg/declassified-records/rg-330-defense-secretary/ |title=Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency. US National Archives and Records Administration |publisher=Archives.gov |date=2011-10-19 |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In America, the same rockets that were designed to rain down on [[United Kingdom|Britain]] were used instead by scientists as research vehicles for developing the new technology further. The V-2 evolved into the American [[Redstone rocket]], used in the early space program.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|von Braun|1963|pp=452–465}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, rockets were used to study high-altitude conditions, by radio [[telemetry]] of temperature and pressure of the atmosphere, detection of [[cosmic rays]], and further research; notably the [[Bell X-1]], the first manned vehicle to break the sound barrier. This continued in the US under von Braun and the others, who were destined to become part of the US scientific community.

Independently, in the [[Soviet space program|Soviet Union's space program]] research continued under the leadership of the chief designer [[Sergei Korolev]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmspacemuseum.org/halloffame/detail.php?id=15 |title=International Space Hall of Fame: Sergei Korolev |publisher=Nmspacemuseum.org|accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of German technicians, the V-2 was duplicated and improved as the [[R-1 (rocket)|R-1]], [[R-2 rocket|R-2]], and [[R-5 (rocket)|R-5]] missiles. German designs were abandoned in the late 1940s, and the foreign workers were sent home. A new series of engines built by Glushko and based on inventions of [[Aleksei Mihailovich Isaev]] formed the basis of the first ICBM, the [[R-7 (rocket)|R-7]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web| url = http://www.energia.ru/english/energia/launchers/rocket-r7.html | title = Rocket R-7 | publisher = S.P.Korolev RSC Energia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The R-7 launched the first satellite, [[Sputnik 1]], and later [[Yuri Gagarin]], the first man into space, and the first lunar and planetary probes. This rocket is still in use today. These prestigious events attracted the attention of top politicians, along with additional funds for further research.

One problem that had not been solved was [[atmospheric reentry]]. It had been shown that an orbital vehicle easily had enough kinetic energy to vaporize itself, and yet it was known that meteorites can make it down to the ground. The mystery was solved in the US in 1951 when [[H. Julian Allen]] and [[Alfred J. Eggers|A. J. Eggers, Jr.]] of the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] (NACA) made the counterintuitive discovery that a blunt shape (high drag) permitted the most effective heat shield. With this type of shape, around 99% of the energy goes into the air rather than the vehicle, and this permitted safe recovery of orbital vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hansen|1987}} [https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4305/ch12.htm Chapter 12.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Allen and Eggers discovery, initially treated as a military secret, was eventually published in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Allen|Eggers|1958}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blunt body theory made possible the heat shield designs that were embodied in the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]], [[Project Gemini|Gemini]], [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Apollo]], and [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz]] [[space capsule]]s, enabling astronauts and cosmonauts to survive the fiery re-entry into Earth's atmosphere. Some [[spaceplane]]s such as the [[Space Shuttle]] made use of the same theory. At the time the [[Space Transportation System|STS]] was being conceived, [[Maxime Faget]], the Director of Engineering and Development at the [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|Manned Spacecraft Center]], was not satisfied with the purely ''lifting re-entry'' method (as proposed for the cancelled [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar|X-20 "Dyna-Soar"]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Launius|first1=Roger D.|last2=Jenkins|first2=Dennis R.|title=Coming home: reentry and recovery from space|date=2012|publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-0-16-091064-7|page=x|url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/695726main_ComingHome-ebook.pdf|accessdate=4 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He designed a space shuttle which operated as a blunt body by entering the atmosphere at an extremely high [[angle of attack]] of 40°&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Viviani|first1=Antonio|last2=Pezzella|first2=Giuseppe|title=Heat Transfer Analysis for a Winged Reentry Flight Test Bed|journal=International Journal of Engineering (IJE)|date=January 3, 2011|volume=3|issue=3|page=341|citeseerx = 10.1.1.301.9032 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the underside facing the direction of flight, creating a large [[Bow shock (aerodynamics)|shock wave]] that would [[Atmospheric entry#Blunt body entry vehicles|deflect most of the heat]] around the vehicle instead of into it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Launius|first1=Roger D.|last2=Jenkins|first2=Dennis R.|title=Coming home: reentry and recovery from space|date=2012|publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-0-16-091064-7|page=187|url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/695726main_ComingHome-ebook.pdf|accessdate=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Space Shuttle essentially uses a combination of a ''ballistic entry'' (Blunt body theory) and then at an altitude of about {{convert|122,000|m|ft|abbr=on}}, the re-entry interface takes place.

Rockets became extremely important militarily as modern [[intercontinental ballistic missiles]] (ICBMs) when it was realized that [[nuclear weapons]] carried on a rocket vehicle were essentially impossible for existing defense systems to stop once launched, and launch vehicles such as the R-7, [[Atlas (rocket family)|Atlas]], and [[Titan (rocket family)|Titan]] became delivery platforms for these weapons.

Fueled partly by the [[Cold War]], the 1960s became the decade of rapid development of rocket technology particularly in the Soviet Union ([[Vostok rocket|Vostok]], [[Soyuz (rocket family)|Soyuz]], [[Proton rocket|Proton]]) and in the [[United States]] (e.g. the [[X-15]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/monograph18.pdf |title=(PDF) '&amp;#39;Hypersonics Before the Shuttle: A Concise History of the X-15 Research Airplane'&amp;#39; (NASA SP-2000-4518, 2000) |format=PDF|accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[X-20 Dyna-Soar]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Houchin|2006}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; aircraft). There was also significant research in other countries, such as France, Britain, Japan, Australia, etc., and a growing use of rockets for [[Space exploration]], with pictures returned from the far side of the [[Moon]] and unmanned flights for [[Mars exploration]].

In America, the manned spaceflight programs, [[Project Mercury]], [[Project Gemini]], and later the [[Apollo program]], culminated in 1969 with the first manned [[moon landing|landing on the moon]] using the [[Saturn V]], causing the New York Times to retract its earlier editorial implying that spaceflight couldn't work:

{{Quotation|Further investigation and experimentation have confirmed the findings of Isaac Newton in the 17th century and it is now definitely established that a rocket can function in a vacuum as well as in an atmosphere. The Times regrets the error.|New York Times, 17 June 1969 - A Correction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kuntz |first=Tom |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/14/news/150th-anniversary-1851-2001-the-facts-that-got-away.html |title=New York Times 17 June 1969 - A Correction |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2001-11-14 |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the 1970s, the United States made five more lunar landings before cancelling the [[Apollo program]] in 1975. The replacement vehicle, the partially reusable [[Space Shuttle]], was intended to be cheaper,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|GAO|1972}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but no large reduction in costs was achieved. Meanwhile, in 1973, the expendable [[Ariane (rocket)|Ariane]] programme was begun, a launcher that by the year 2000 would capture much of the [[Geosynchronous satellite|geosat]] market.

'''Latent heat''' is thermal energy released or absorbed, by a body or a [[thermodynamic system]], during a constant-temperature process — usually a [[Phase_transition#Modern_classifications|first-order phase transition]].

Latent heat can be understood as heat energy in hidden form which is supplied or extracted to change the state of a substance without changing its temperature. Examples are [[latent heat of fusion]] and [[latent heat of vaporization]] involved in [[Phase transition|phase changes]], i.e. a substance condensing or vaporizing at a specified temperature and pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term was introduced around 1762 by [[Great Britain|British]] [[chemist]] [[Joseph Black]]. It is derived from the Latin ''latere'' (''to lie hidden''). Black used the term in the context of [[calorimetry]] where a heat transfer caused a volume change in a body while its temperature was constant.

In contrast to latent heat, [[sensible heat]] is a heat transfer that results in a temperature change in a body.

==Usage==
The terms ″sensible heat″ and ″latent heat″ refer to types of heat transfer between a body and its surroundings;  they depend on the properties of the body. ″Sensible heat″ is ″sensed″ or felt in a process as a change in the body's temperature. ″Latent heat″ is heat transferred in a process without change of the body's temperature, for example, in a phase change ( solid / liquid / gas ).  

Both sensible and latent heats are observed in many processes of transfer of energy in nature. Latent heat is associated with the change of phase of atmospheric or ocean water,  [[vaporization]], [[condensation]], [[freezing]] or [[melting]], whereas sensible heat is energy transferred that is evident in change of the temperature of the atmosphere or ocean, or ice, without those phase changes, though it is associated with changes of pressure and volume.

The original usage of the term, as introduced by Black, was applied to systems that were intentionally held at constant temperature. Such usage referred to ''latent heat of expansion'' and several other related latent heats. These latent heats are defined independently of the conceptual framework of thermodynamics.&lt;ref&gt;Bryan, G.H. (1907). ''Thermodynamics. An Introductory Treatise dealing mainly with First Principles and their Direct Applications'', B.G. Tuebner, Leipzig, pages 9, 20–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

When a body is heated at constant temperature by thermal radiation in a microwave field for example, it may expand by an amount described by its ''latent heat with respect to volume'' or ''latent heat of expansion'', or increase its pressure by an amount described by its ''latent heat with respect to pressure''.&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell, J.C. (1872). ''Theory of Heat'', third edition, Longmans, Green, and Co., London, page 73.&lt;/ref&gt;
'''Latent heat''' is energy released or absorbed, by a body or a [[thermodynamic system]], during a constant-temperature process.
Two common forms of latent heat are [[enthalpy of fusion|latent heat of fusion]] ([[melting]]) and [[enthalpy of vaporization|latent heat of vaporization]] ([[boiling]]).  These names describe the direction of energy flow when changing from one phase to the next: from solid to liquid, and liquid to gas.

In both cases the change is [[endothermic]], meaning that the system absorbs energy.
For example, when water evaporates, energy is required for the water molecules to overcome the forces of attraction between them, the transition from water to vapor requires an input of energy.

If the vapor then condenses to a liquid on a surface, then the vapor's latent energy absorbed during evaporation is released as the liquid's [[sensible heat]] onto the surface.

The large value of the [[enthalpy]] of condensation of water vapor is the reason that steam is a far more effective heating medium than boiling water, and is more hazardous.

===Meteorology===
In [[meteorology]], latent heat flux is the [[flux]] of heat from the Earth's surface to the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] that is associated with [[evaporation]] or [[transpiration]] of water at the surface and subsequent [[condensation]] of [[water vapor]] in the [[troposphere]]. It is an important component of Earth's surface energy budget.  Latent heat flux has been commonly measured with the [[Bowen ratio]] technique, or more recently since the mid-1900s by the [[eddy covariance|Jonathan]] [[eddy covariance|Beaver]] method.

==History==
The English word ''[[wikt:latent#English|latent]]'' comes from Latin ''[[wikt:latens#Latin|latēns]]'', meaning ''lying hidden''.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|latent}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Charlton T. (1890). ''An Elementary Latin Dictionary''. Entry for [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0060%3Aentry%3Dlatens latens].&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''latent heat'' was introduced into calorimetry around 1750 when [[Joseph Black]], commissioned by producers of [[Scotch whisky]] in search of ideal quantities of fuel and water for their distilling process,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode | title= Credit Where It's Due | url           = | accessdate= | series= The Day the Universe Changed | serieslink= The Day the Universe Changed | credits= [[James Burke (science historian)|James Burke]] | network= BBC | date= 1979 | number = 6  | time=50 (34 minutes)}}&lt;/ref&gt; to studying system changes, such as of volume and pressure, when the thermodynamic system was held at constant temperature in a thermal bath. [[James Prescott Joule]] characterised latent energy as the energy of interaction in a given configuration of particles, i.e. a form of [[potential energy]], and the sensible heat as an energy that was indicated by the thermometer,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

|page=274
|quote=I am inclined to believe that both of these hypotheses will be found to hold good,&amp;mdash;that in some instances, particularly in the case of sensible heat, or such as is indicated by the thermometer, heat will be found to consist in the living force of the particles of the bodies in which it is induced; whilst in others, particularly in the case of latent heat, the phenomena are produced by the separation of particle from particle, so as to cause them to attract one another through a greater space.
}}, Lecture on Matter, Living Force, and Heat. May 5 and 12, 1847&lt;/ref&gt; relating the latter to [[thermal energy]].

==Specific latent heat==
A ''specific'' latent heat (''L'') expresses the amount of energy in the form of heat (''Q'') required to completely effect a phase change of a unit of mass (''m''), usually {{gaps|1|kg}}, of a substance as an [[intensive property]]:
:&lt;math&gt;L = \frac {Q}{m}.&lt;/math&gt;
Intensive properties are material characteristics and are not dependent on the size or extent of the sample. Commonly quoted and tabulated in the literature are the specific latent heat of fusion and the specific latent heat of vaporization for many substances.

From this definition, the latent heat for a given mass of a substance is calculated by
:&lt;math&gt;Q = {m}  {L}&lt;/math&gt;
where:
:''Q'' is the amount of energy released or absorbed during the change of phase of the substance (in [[kilojoule|kJ]] or in [[BTU]]),
:''m'' is the mass of the substance (in [[kg]] or in [[Pound (mass)|lb]]), and
:''L'' is the specific latent heat for a particular substance (kJ kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; or in BTU lb&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;), either ''L''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; for fusion, or ''L''&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; for vaporization.

==Specific latent heat for condensation of water in clouds==
&lt;!-- Is this dependant on pressure ? - --&gt;
The specific latent heat of condensation of water in the temperature range from −25&amp;nbsp;°C to 40&amp;nbsp;°C is approximated by the following empirical cubic function:
:&lt;math&gt;L_\text{water}(T) = (2500.8 - 2.36 T + 0.0016 T^2 - 0.00006 T^3)~\text{J/g},&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="RYfit"&gt;[[Curve fitting#Fitting lines and polynomial curves to data points|Polynomial curve fit]]s to Table 2.1. {{cite book |author1=R.

where the temperature &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is taken to be the numerical value in °C.

For [[sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]] and [[deposition (physics)|deposition]] from and into ice, the specific latent heat is almost constant in the temperature range from −40&amp;nbsp;°C to 0&amp;nbsp;°C and can be approximated by the following empirical quadratic function:
:&lt;math&gt;L_\text{ice}(T) = (2834.1 - 0.29 T - 0.004 T^2)~\text{J/g}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="RYfit"/&gt;

The lake is located within [[Cedar County, Nebraska|Cedar]] and [[Knox County, Nebraska|Knox]] Counties in Nebraska and [[Bon Homme County, South Dakota|Bon Homme]] and [[Yankton County, South Dakota|Yankton]] Counties in South Dakota. The lake is located approximately {{convert|4|mi}} west or upstream of [[Yankton, South Dakota]]. 

== History ==
The [[Missouri River Valley]] Area is abound with history involving several early Native American Tribes, Pioneers, and other settlers to the area due to ease of river transportation and abundant resources.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nwo.usace.army.mil/Missions/Civil-Works/Cultural-Resources/&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis and Clark Lake is named after explorers [[Meriwether Lewis]] and [[William Clark]] of the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]].  The lake is located along the [[Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nps.gov/lecl/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[archaeological]] record in the area dates back to the [[Archaic stage|Archaic Period]], sometime around  3,000 to 5,000 [[Anno Domini|B.C.]] The Archaic Period people lived along small [[tributary]] streams that flow into the [[Missouri River Valley|Missouri Valley]]. Later, [[Woodland Period]] people (500 B.C. – 1,000 A.D.) lived in the area. More recent inhabitants include the [[Ponca]], [[Yankton Sioux]] and [[Omaha people|Omaha]] tribes in the late 18th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nwo.usace.army.mil/Missions/Dam-and-Lake-Projects/Missouri-River-Dams/Gavins-Point/&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Minnesota]] [[Santee Sioux]] arrived on the river shore in the mid-1800's and remain in the area. In 1804, while traveling up the Missouri River on their epic journey to the [[Pacific Ocean]], Lewis and Clark participated in a Grand council with the Yankton Sioux at a site below [[Calumet Bluff]]. This significant meeting was the first meeting with a Sioux tribe on their journey upstream. The lake area is a part of the [[Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nps.gov/lecl/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In 1874, the [[Bon Homme Colony]] of Hutterites, a branch of the [[Mennonite]] movement exiled from [[Austria]], settled on what is now the north shore of Lewis and Clark Lake. They are the first Hutterite Colony in South Dakota and the United States. The colony maintains a traditional communal way of life.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nwo.usace.army.mil/Missions/Dam-and-Lake-Projects/Missouri-River-Dams/Gavins-Point/&lt;/ref&gt; The lake was filled in 1957 with the completion of construction of Gavins Point Dam across the river valley. 

==Parks and recreation==

[[File:LewisandClarkSRA.jpg|thumb|right|View of Lewis and Clark Lake from [[Lewis &amp; Clark Recreation Area]] along the South Dakota shore.]]
Lewis and Clark Lake is a very popular regional tourist destination in the upper [[Midwest]] for [[camping]], [[water sports]], [[hiking]], [[bird watching]], [[hunting]], [[fishing]], [[swimming]], and [[biking]]. Average annual public visitation exceeds one-million visitors per year to the lake area. There are 27 public [[recreation]] areas&lt;ref&gt;https://corpslakes.erdc.dren.mil/visitors/projects.cfm?Id=G606440&lt;/ref&gt; around the lake containing boat ramps, marinas, campgrounds, and day-use areas. The upper stretches of the lake are renowned for their superior [[waterfowl]] viewing and hunting opportunities along the Missouri River [[flyway]].

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers manages several [[Camping|campgrounds]] and parks below Gavins Point Dam. The [[Lewis &amp; Clark Recreation Area]], a South Dakota [[state park]] is a popular recreational destination, several boat ramps, a full-service marina and resort, and over 400 campsites are available for public use. [[Lewis and Clark State Recreation Area (Nebraska)|Lewis &amp; Clark State Recreation Area]] is a popular state recreation area in Nebraska along the lake's southern shore with several campgrounds, rental cabins, full-service marina and several trails. [[Springfield Recreation Area]] near the upper part of the lake is also popular with visitors for camping and lake access. There are two golf courses along the lakeshore, Crofton-Lakeview Golf Course, near [[Crofton, Nebraska|Crofton]] and Springfield Golf Course near [[Springfield, South Dakota|Springfield]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nwo.usace.army.mil/&lt;/ref&gt;. Located downstream of the lake is the 59-mile reach of the [[Missouri National Recreational River]] (MNRR) which stretches eastward from the dam to [[Ponca State Park]], upstream of the lake is the 39-mile reach of the MNRR which stretches westward to [[Fort Randall Dam]]. 

===Lewis and Clark Visitor Center===
The '''Lewis and Clark Visitor Center''' is located just south of Gavins Point Dam atop [[Calumet Bluff]] with stunning views of Lewis and Clark Lake, Lake Yankton, and the Missouri River below the dam. The visitor center is open daily from Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day weekend and open weekdays during other times of the year. The visitor center interprets the history of the [[Missouri River Basin]], including [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], [[American pioneer|pioneers]], the Lewis and Clark Expedition (which traveled through the area); along with local [[wildlife]] and the history of the Corps of Engineers in the area. A theater shows educational videos on the Lewis and Clark Expedition, construction of Gavins Point Dam, and the natural history of the Missouri River Region. A bookstore offers educational books, videos, and other merchandise for sale. The visitor center is known for exceptional viewing of the majestic [[American Bald Eagle]], which frequents the Missouri River below the dam, especially in winter months. The visitors center is operated and staffed by U.S. Army Corps of Engineers [[Park ranger|Park Rangers]], who also give guided tours of Gavins Point Dam and the [[Hydroelectricity|power plant]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nwo.usace.army.mil/Missions/Dam-and-Lake-Projects/Missouri-River-Dams/Gavins-Point/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fish, wildlife and natural resources==
The [[Natural resource|natural resources]] and [[Public land|public lands]] on and around the lake are cooperatively [[Natural resource management|managed]] by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, [[Nebraska Game and Parks Commission]], and the [[South Dakota Department of Game, Fish, and Parks]]. Common [[Game (hunting)|game]] species around the lake include [[White-tailed deer]], [[Turkey (bird)|Wild Turkey]], many species of [[waterfowl]], [[Common pheasant|Pheasant]], [[Cottontail rabbit]], [[Mourning Dove]], and [[squirrel]]. The [[American Bald Eagle]] is commonly seen around the dam and lake area, especially in the winter months. Each January the Lewis and Clark Visitor Center hosts "Bald Eagle Days" a live-bird program that is popular with visitors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nwo.usace.army.mil/Missions/Dam-and-Lake-Projects/Missouri-River-Dams/Gavins-Point/&lt;/ref&gt;

Species of [[Fish|fish]] present include [[walleye]], [[northern pike]], [[sauger]], [[Centrarchidae|sunfish]], [[yellow perch]], [[common carp]], [[black bullhead]], [[channel catfish]], and [[smallmouth bass]].&lt;ref&gt;https://outdoornebraska.gov/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/2015FishSamplingReport_LewisAndClarkReservoir.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. Fishing below [[Gavins Point Dam]] is very popular, especially for the annual [[paddlefish]] [[snagging]] season in October and [[bowfishing]] in June. The "Fishing Wall" immediately below the dam's [[spillway]] is popular for fishing year-round as the dam keeps the river free of ice in the winter months.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] monitor and manage threatened and [[endangered species]] on the lake and river. Species of concern include the [[Pallid sturgeon]], [[least tern]], and [[piping plover]]. A branch of the Corps known as the [http://moriverrecovery.usace.army.mil/ Missouri River Recovery Program] monitors these species and helps to restore native habitat that was lost as a result of dam construction and [[channelization (rivers)|channelization]] of the Missouri River.&lt;ref&gt;http://moriverrecovery.usace.army.mil/mrrp/f?p=136:1&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gavins Point National Fish Hatchery]] is located just downstream of the lake&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fws.gov/mountain-prairie/fisheries/gavinsPoint.php&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Current lake issues===
[[File:Dreissena polymorpha3.jpg|thumb|right|Close-up of a typical shell of a [[zebra mussel]], an unwanted [[aquatic animal|aquatic]] [[invasive species]] was discovered in the lake in 2014.]]
There are several issues impacting recreation, wildlife, and other issues. In 2014 [[zebra mussels]], an [[aquatic animal|aquatic]] [[invasive species|invasive]] [[mussel]] were discovered in the lake and have infested the reservoir and the Missouri River downstream of Gavins Point Dam.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nwo.usace.army.mil/Media/News-Releases/Article/617615/zebra-mussels-discovered-at-lewis-and-clark-lake/&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewis and Clark Lake is significantly impacted by [[sedimentation]] and [[siltation]] issues, diminishing the overall water surface area, water storage capacity, and recreational opportunities. [[Sediment]] carried by the Missouri River and [[Niobrara River]] is slowed and trapped within the reservoir due to the dam impounding and thus slowing the natural river flow. Studies show approximately 5.1 tons of sediment are deposited in the lake each year, which contributes to the lake's increasing size of delta area on the western portions of the lake. Approximately 60% of the sediment comes from the [[Nebraska Sandhills]] via the Niobrara River. As of 2016, approximately 30% of the lake's overall surface area has diminished due to sedimentation deposits, and some figures project by 2045 approximately 50% of the lake will be diminished due to sedimentation deposits. Presently, there is no plan or solution to remove or slow the progression of the siltation within the lake.&lt;ref&gt;http://msaconline.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3286">This is a '''list of [[production function]]s''' that have been used in the [[economics]] literature. Production functions are a key part of modelling [[national output]] and [[national income]].

The production functions listed below, and their properties are shown for the case of two factors of production, [[capital (economics)|capital]] (K), and [[labor economics|labor]] (L), mostly for heuristic purposes. These functions and their properties are easily generalizable to include additional factors of production (like land, natural resources, entrepreneurship, etc.)

==Technology==

There are three common ways to incorporate technology (or the efficiency with which factors of production are used) into a production function (here ''A'' is a scale factor, ''F'' is a production function, and ''Y'' is the amount of physical output produced):
* [[Hicks-neutral technical change|Hicks-neutral technology]], or "factor augmenting": &lt;math&gt;\ Y = AF(K,L)&lt;/math&gt; 
* Harrod-neutral technology, or "labor augmenting": &lt;math&gt;\ Y = F(K,AL)&lt;/math&gt; 
* Solow-neutral technology, or "capital augmenting": &lt;math&gt;\ Y = F(AK,L)&lt;/math&gt;

==Elasticity of substitution==

The elasticity of substitution between [[factors of production]] is a measure of how easily one factor can be substituted for another. With two factors of production, say, ''K'' and ''L'', it is a measure of the curvature of a production [[isoquant]]. The mathematical definition is:

:&lt;math&gt;\ \epsilon=\left[\frac {\partial(slope)} {\partial(L/K)} \frac {L/K} {slope}\right]^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

where "slope" denotes the slope of the isoquant, given by

:&lt;math&gt;\ slope=-\frac {\partial F(K,L)/ \partial K} {\partial F(K,L)/ \partial L}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Returns to scale==

[[Returns to scale]] can be
* Increasing returns to scale: doubling all input usages more than doubles output. 
* Decreasing returns to scale: doubling all input usages less than doubles output.
* Constant returns to scale: doubling all input usages exactly doubles output.

==Some widely used forms==
* [[Constant elasticity of substitution]] (CES) function: 
::&lt;math&gt; Y = A[\alpha K^\gamma + (1-\alpha) L^\gamma]^{\frac{1}{\gamma}} &lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;\gamma \isin [-\infty,1]&lt;/math&gt; 

::which includes the special cases of:

::*Linear production (or perfect substitutes) 
::::&lt;math&gt;\ Y=A[\alpha K+ (1-\alpha) L]&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;\ \gamma=1&lt;/math&gt;
::*[[Cobb&amp;ndash;Douglas production function ]] (or imperfect complements) 
::::&lt;math&gt;\ Y=AK^\alpha L^{1-\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;\gamma \to 0&lt;/math&gt;
::*[[Leontief production function]] (or perfect complements) 
::::&lt;math&gt;\ Y=\text{Min}[K,L]&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;\gamma \to -\infty&lt;/math&gt;

*[[Translog]], a linear approximation of CES via a [[Taylor series|Taylor polynomial]] about &lt;math&gt;\gamma = 0&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\ln(Y)=\ln(A)+a_L \ln(L)+a_K \ln(K)+b_{LL}\ln^2(L) + b_{LK} \ln(L) \ln(K) + b_{KK} \ln^2(K)&lt;/math&gt;

*Stone-Gerry,a variation of the Cobb-Douglas production function that considers existence of a threshold factor requirement (represented by &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;) of each output 
::&lt;math&gt;Y=A\prod_{i=1}^n(x_i-z_i)^\alpha_{i}&lt;/math&gt;

*Zellener-Revankar Production Function (ZRPF)
::&lt;math&gt;\ln Y+\alpha Y=\beta_0+\beta_1 \ln K+ \beta_2 \ln L &lt;/math&gt;

==Radiography==
[[File:Photon Mean Free Path.png|thumb|right|400px|Mean free path for photons in energy range from 1 keV to 20 MeV for elements with [[Atomic number|''Z'']] = 1 to 100.&lt;ref&gt;Based on data from {{cite web|url=http://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/XrayNoteB.html |title=NIST: Note - X-Ray Form Factor and Attenuation Databases |publisher=Physics.nist.gov |date=1998-03-10 |accessdate=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The discontinuities are due to low density of gas elements. Six bands correspond to neighborhoods of six [[w:noble gas|noble gases]]. Also shown are locations of [[w:en:absorption edge|absorption edges]].]]

In [[gamma-ray]] [[radiography]] the ''mean free path'' of a [[pencil beam]] of mono-energetic [[photon]]s is the average distance a photon travels between collisions with atoms of the target material. It depends on the material and the energy of the photons:

:&lt;math&gt;\ell = \mu^{-1} = ( (\mu/\rho) \rho)^{-1},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''μ'' is the [[linear attenuation coefficient]], ''μ/ρ'' is the [[mass attenuation coefficient]] and ''ρ'' is the [[density]] of the material. The [[mass attenuation coefficient]] can be looked up or calculated for any material and energy combination using the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) databases&lt;ref name=NIST1&gt;{{cite web

In [[X-ray]] [[radiography]] the calculation of the ''mean free path'' is more complicated, because photons are not mono-energetic, but have some [[Frequency distribution|distribution]] of energies called a [[spectrum]]. As photons move through the target material, they are [[attenuation|attenuated]] with probabilities depending on their energy, as a result their distribution changes in process called spectrum hardening. Because of spectrum hardening, the ''mean free path'' of the [[X-ray]] spectrum changes with distance.

Sometimes one measures the thickness of a material in the ''number of mean free paths''. Material with the thickness of one ''mean free path'' will attenuate 37% (1/[[e (mathematical constant)|''e'']]) of photons. This concept is closely related to [[half-value layer]] (HVL): a material with a thickness of one HVL will attenuate 50% of photons. A standard x-ray image is a transmission image, an image with negative logarithm of its intensities is sometimes called a ''number of mean free paths'' image.

==Electronics==
[[Electrical mobility]], a value directly related to [[electrical conductivity]], is:
:&lt;math&gt;\mu = \frac{e \tau}{m} = \frac{e d}{m^* v_{\rm F}},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''e'' is the [[elementary charge|charge]], &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is the [[mean free time]], ''m&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;'' is the [[Effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]], ''d'' is the mean free path, and ''v''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Fermi velocity]] of the charge carrier. The Fermi velocity can easily be derived from the [[Fermi energy]] via the non-relativistic kinetic energy equation. In [[thin film]]s, however, the film thickness can be smaller than the predicted mean free path, making surface scattering much more noticeable, effectively increasing the [[resistivity]].

==Optics==
If one takes a suspension of non-light-absorbing particles of diameter ''d'' with a [[volume fraction]] ''Φ'', the mean free path of the photons is:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

where ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; is the scattering efficiency factor. ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; can be evaluated numerically for spherical particles using [[Mie theory]].

==Acoustics==
In an otherwise empty cavity, the mean free path of a single particle bouncing off the walls is:

:&lt;math&gt;l = \frac{F V}{S},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''V'' is volume of the cavity, ''S'' is total inside surface area of cavity and ''F'' a constant related to the shape of the cavity. For most simple cavity shapes ''F'' is approximately 4.&lt;ref name="YoungRW"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Young|first1=Robert W.|title=Sabine Reverberation Equation and Sound Power Calculations|journal=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America|date=July 1959|volume=31|issue=7|page=918|doi=10.1121/1.1907816|bibcode=1959ASAJ...31..912Y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mean free path.png|frame|Slab of target]]

Imagine a beam of particles being shot through a target, and consider an infinitesimally thin slab of the target (see the figure).  The atoms (or particles) that might stop a beam particle are shown in red. The magnitude of the mean free path depends on the characteristics of the system. An expression for the MFP is

:&lt;math&gt;\ell = (\sigma n)^{-1},&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|ℓ}} is the mean free path, {{mvar|n}} is the number of target particles per unit volume, and {{mvar|&amp;sigma;}} is the effective [[cross section (physics)|cross-sectional]] area for collision.

The area of the slab is {{math|''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and its volume is {{math|''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ''dx''}}.  The typical number of stopping atoms in the slab is the concentration {{mvar|n}} times the volume, i.e., {{math|''n L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ''dx''}}.  The probability that a beam particle will be stopped in that slab is the net area of the stopping atoms divided by the total area of the slab:

:&lt;math&gt;P(\text{stopping within }dx) = \frac{\text{Area}_\text{atoms}}{\text{Area}_\text{slab}} = \frac{\sigma n L^{2}\, dx}{L^{2}} = n \sigma\, dx,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|&amp;sigma;}} is the area (or, more formally, the "[[scattering cross-section]]") of one atom.

The drop in beam intensity equals the incoming beam intensity multiplied by the probability of the particle being stopped within the slab:

:&lt;math&gt;dI = -I n \sigma \,dx.&lt;/math&gt;

This is an [[ordinary differential equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dI}{dx} = -I n \sigma \overset{\text{def}}{=} -\frac{I}{\ell},&lt;/math&gt;

whose solution is known as [[Beer-Lambert law]] and has the form &lt;math&gt;I = I_{0} e^{-x/\ell}&lt;/math&gt;, where {{mvar|x}} is the distance traveled by the beam through the target, and {{math|''I''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the beam intensity before it entered the target; {{mvar|ℓ}} is called the mean free path because it equals the [[mean]] distance traveled by a beam particle before being stopped. To see this, note that the probability that a particle is absorbed between {{mvar|x}} and {{math|''x'' + ''dx''}} is given by

:&lt;math&gt;dP(x) = \frac{I(x)-I(x+dx)}{I_0} = \frac{1}{\ell} e^{-x/\ell} dx.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus the [[expectation value]] (or average, or simply mean) of {{mvar|x}} is

:&lt;math&gt;\langle x \rangle \overset{\text{def}}{=} \int_0^\infty x dP(x) = \int_0^\infty \frac{x}{\ell} e^{-x/\ell} \, dx = \ell.&lt;/math&gt;

The fraction of particles that are not stopped ([[attenuation|attenuated]]) by the slab is called [[Transmittance|transmission]] &lt;math&gt;T = I/I_{0} = e^{-x/\ell}&lt;/math&gt;, where {{mvar|x}} is equal to the thickness of the slab {{math|''x {{=}} dx''}}.

==Kinetic theory==
In [[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]] the ''mean free path'' of a particle, such as a [[molecule]], is the average distance the particle travels between collisions with other moving particles.  The formula &lt;math&gt;\ell = (n\sigma)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; still holds for a particle with a high velocity relative to the velocities of an ensemble of identical particles with random locations. If, on the other hand, the velocities of the identical particles have a [[Maxwell distribution]], the following relationship applies:&lt;ref&gt;S. Chapman and T. G. Cowling, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Cbp5JP2OTrwC&amp;pg=PA88 ''The mathematical theory of non-uniform gases''], 3rd. edition, Cambridge University Press, 1990, {{ISBN|0-521-40844-X}}, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\ell = (\sqrt{2}\, n\sigma)^{-1},&lt;/math&gt;

and using &lt;math&gt;n = N/V = p/(k_\text{B}T)&lt;/math&gt; ([[ideal gas law]]) and &lt;math&gt;\sigma = \pi (2r)^2 = \pi d^2&lt;/math&gt; (effective cross-sectional area for spherical particles with radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;), it may be shown that the mean free path is&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/kinetic/menfre.html |title=Mean Free Path, Molecular Collisions |publisher=Hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\ell = \frac{k_\text{B}T}{\sqrt 2 \pi d^2 p},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''k''{{sub|B}} is the [[Boltzmann constant]].

In practice, the diameter of gas molecules is not well defined. In fact, the [[kinetic diameter]] of a molecule is defined in terms of the mean free path. Typically, gas molecules do not behave like hard spheres, but rather attract each other at larger distances and repel each other at shorter distances, as can be described with a [[Lennard-Jones potential]]. One way to deal with such "soft" molecules is to use the Lennard-Jones σ parameter as the diameter. Another way is to assume a hard-sphere gas that has the same [[kinematic viscosity|viscosity]] as the actual gas being considered. This leads to a mean free path

:&lt;math&gt;\ell = \frac{\mu}{p} \sqrt{\frac{\pi k_\text{B} T}{2 m}},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'' is the molecular mass, and ''&amp;mu;'' is the viscosity.

These different definitions of the molecular diameter can lead to slightly different values of the mean free path.

==Nuclear and particle physics==
In particle physics the concept of the mean free path is not commonly used, being replaced by the similar concept of [[attenuation length]].  In particular, for high-energy photons, which mostly interact by electron–positron [[pair production]], the [[radiation length]] is used much like the mean free path in radiography.

Independent-particle models in nuclear physics require the undisturbed orbiting of [[nucleon]]s within the [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]] before they interact with other nucleons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.res.kutc.kansai-u.ac.jp/~cook/NVSIndex.html|title=Models of the Atomic Nucleus|last=Cook|first=Norman D.|date=2010|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]|isbn=978-3-642-14736-4|edition=2|location=Heidelberg|page=324|chapter=The Mean Free Path of Nucleons in Nuclei|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=The effective mean free path of a nucleon in nuclear matter must be somewhat larger than the nuclear dimensions in order to allow the use of the independent particle model.

[[File:Nyctograph reconstruction.jpg|thumb|right|Reconstructed nyctograph, with scale demonstrated by a 5 [[euro]] cent.]]
'''Nyctography''' is a form of [[substitution cipher]] writing created by [[Lewis Carroll]] (Charles Lutwidge Dodgson) in 1891.

Nyctography is written with a nyctograph (also invented by Carroll) and uses a system of dots and strokes all based on a dot placed in the upper left corner. Using the Nyctograph, one could quickly jot down ideas or notes without the aid of light.

Carroll invented the Nyctograph and Nyctography because he was often awakened during the night with thoughts that needed to be written down immediately, and didn't want to go through the lengthy process of lighting a lamp just to have to extinguish it shortly thereafter.

==Nyctograph==
The device consisted of a gridded card with sixteen square holes, each a quarter inch wide, and system of symbols representing an alphabet of Carroll's design, which could then be transcribed the following day. 

He first named it "typhlograph", but at the suggestion of one of his brother-students,{{clarify|reason=What does this term mean? Is this a fellow student? I'm not sure if Caroll was a student in 1891. Note: the wording is present in the original source as-is, so not an error.|date=November 2018}} this was subsequently changed into "Nyctograph".&lt;ref name="life"&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/11483/11483-h/11483-h.htm “The Life And Letters Of Lewis Carroll (Rev. C. L. Dodgson)” by  Stuart Dodgson Collingwood  B.A. Christ Church, Oxford]&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, Carroll used an oblong of card with an oblong cut out of the centre to guide his writing in the dark.&lt;ref name="life"/&gt; This did not appear to be satisfactory as the results were illegible. The new and final version of the nyctograph is recorded in his journal of September 24, 1891, and is the subject of a letter to ''The Lady'' magazine of October 29, 1891: 
{{quote|Any one who has tried, as I have often done, the process of getting out of bed at 2 a.m. in a winter night, lighting a candle, and recording some happy thought which would probably be otherwise forgotten, will agree with me it entails much discomfort. All I have now to do, if I wake and think of something I wish to record, is to draw from under the pillow a small memorandum book containing my Nyctograph, write a few lines, or even a few pages, without even putting the hands outside the bed-clothes, replace the book, and go to sleep again. … I tried rows of square holes, each to hold one letter (quarter of an inch square I found a very convenient size), and this proved a much better plan than the former; but the letters were still apt to be illegible. Then I said to myself ‘Why not invent a square alphabet, using only dots at the corners, and lines along the sides?’ I soon found that, to make the writing easy to read, it was necessary to know where each square began. This I secured by the rule that every square-letter should contain a large black dot in the N.W. corner. … [I] succeeded in getting 23 of [the square-letters] to have a distinct resemblance to the letters they were to represent. Think of the number of lonely hours a blind man often spends doing nothing, when he would gladly record his thoughts, and you will realise what a blessing you can confer on him by giving him a small ‘indelible’ memorandum-book, with a piece of paste-board containing rows of square holes, and teaching him the square-alphabet.}}

From the description it appears that Carroll’s nyctograph was a single row of 16 boxes cut from a piece of card. Carroll would enter one of his symbols in each box, then move the card down to the next line (which, in the darkness, probably, he would have to estimate) and then repeat the process.

==Nyctographic alphabet==
[[File:Nyctographic alphabet.png|thumb|Lewis Carroll's nyctographic alphabet]]
Each character had a large dot or circle in the upper-left corner. Beside the 26 letters of the alphabet, there were five additional characters for 'and', 'the', the corners of the letter 'f' to indicate that the following characters were digits ('figures'), the corners of the letter 'l' to indicate that they were letters, and the corners of the letter 'd' to indicate that the following six characters were a date in DDMMYY format. There was no capitalization, punctuation or digits ''per se'', though modern font designers have created them (e.g. capitals may be double-scored, punctuation marks may have the large dot at the bottom right corner, digits at the bottom left). 

==Numbers==
As in braille, letters were assigned to represent digits. The values were taken from his [[Memoria Technica]], which assigned two consonants to each digit, with vowels unassigned, so that any number could be read off as a word. For nyctography, one of the consonants was used for each digit. Most are the initials of the numerals, as follows. (In brackets are the other values of the Memoria Technica, which apart from leftover ''j'' for 3 have their own motivations.)

* 1 – b (first consonant) [also c]
* 2 – d (for ''duo'' and ''deux'') [also w of 'two']
* 3 – t (for 'three') [also j]
* 4 – f (for 'four') [also q of ''quatre'']
* 5 – l (roman numeral 50) [also v of 'five']
* 6 – s (for 'six') [also x of 'six']
* 7 – m (final of ''septem'') [also p of ''septem'']
* 8 – h (for ''huit'') [also k]
* 9 – n (for 'nine') [also g]
* 0 – z (for 'zero') [also r of 'zero']

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="887">The '''optical force''' is a phenomenon whereby beams of light can attract and repel each other. The force acts along an axis which is perpendicular to the light beams. Because of this, parallel beams can be induced to converge or diverge. The optical force works on a microscopic scale, and cannot currently be detected at larger scales. It was discovered by a team of [[Yale]] researchers led by [[electrical engineer]] Hong Tang.&lt;ref&gt;[http://discovermagazine.com/2010/jan-feb/083 Top 100 Stories of 2009 #83: Like Magnets, Light Can Attract and Repel Itself], Discover magazine, from the January–February 2010 special issue; published online December 21, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The name derives from the Italian word for [[peacock]] (pavone). "In natural stone trade, Pavonazzo is often simply called a Marble."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.graniteland.com/stone/pavonazzo |title=Pavonazzo - a white Marble from Italy |publisher=Graniteland.com |date=2012-09-11 |accessdate=2012-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the many varieties of [[Carrara marble]], distinguished by black/gray-veined white marble.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.es.pavonazzo.italy.marble.stoneinfo.us/ |title=Stone Info &amp;#124; Granite Marble |publisher=Es.pavonazzo.italy.marble.stoneinfo.us |date= |accessdate=2012-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also referred to as "pavonazzetto", and distinguished as:
#Various red and purplish marbles and [[breccias]].
#A marble, used by the ancient Romans, characterized by very irregular veins of dark red with bluish and yellowish tints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/pavonazzo-pavonazzeto-1 |title=pavonazzo, pavonazzeto: Information from |publisher=Answers.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The marble has been used in Rome since the Augustan age, when large-scale quarrying began at Docimium, and columns of it were used in the [[House of Augustus]], as well as in the [[Temple of Mars Ultor]], which also had pavonazzo floor tiles in the cella. Pavonazzetto statues of kneeling Phrygian barbarians existed in the [[Basilica Aemilia]] and [[Horti Sallustiani]]. [[Sperlonga sculptures|Giant statue groups]] carved from Docimaean marble were discovered at [[Sperlonga#Villa_of_Tiberius|Tiberius's Villa in Sperlonga]]. Pavonazzetto was not widely or extensively used before the Roman period; there is no evidence of it in circulation before the last two decades B.C.&lt;ref&gt;Matthias Bruno, et al. “The Docimium Marble Sculptures of the Grotto of Tiberius at Sperlonga.” ''American Journal of Archaeology'', vol. 119, no. 3, 2015, pp. 375–394.&lt;/ref&gt;
Later it was used in Rome in [[Trajan's Markets]] and for the Memoria Petri, the [[tomb of Saint Peter]] and internationally in the influential Baroque Revival-style historic buildings the [[Church of St. Ignatius Loyola (New York City)|Church of St. Ignatius Loyola]], in [[New York City]], and [[Belfast City Hall]] in [[Belfast, Northern Ireland]].

The '''Professor Aristóteles Orsini Planetarium''' ({{lang-pt|Planetário Professor Aristóteles Orsini}}),&lt;ref name="Prefeitura" /&gt; also known as the '''Ibirapuera Planetarium''' ({{lang-pt|Planetário do Ibirapuera}}),&lt;ref name="Globo_24Jan16" /&gt; is a [[planetarium]] in [[Ibirapuera Park]], [[São Paulo]]. It opened in January 1957, and was the first planetarium in Brazil and Latin America.&lt;ref name="Prefeitura" /&gt;&lt;ref name="informer" /&gt; It is one of three planetaria in São Paulo, with the others being [[Carmo Planetarium]]&lt;ref name="Globo_24Jan16" /&gt; and the Johannes Kepler Planetarium at [[Sabina Escola Parque do Conhecimento]].

== History ==
[[File:Projetor, Planetário do Ibirapuera 3.jpg|thumb|right|The projector in the theatre]]
The planetarium was proposed in 1951 by [[Aristóteles Orsini]], then director of the [[Associação dos Amadores de Astronomia de São Paulo]], as part of the 400th anniversary celebrations of the foundation of São Paulo. A Zeiss projector was then purchased, at a cost of [[Brazilian cruzeiro|Cr $]] 3,000,000 (including transportation; 1952 values), arriving at the [[Port of Santos]] by 29 May 1952. Also in 1952, Orsini was commissioned to study the installation of the projector in a planetarium in the city, for which he visited [[Urania Sternwarte]], Switzerland, and interned at the planetarium at [[Palais de la Découverte]], Paris; he then recommended the creation of a science Museum in the same style as that in Paris, with the planetarium attached, which was never realised.&lt;ref name="Prefeitura" /&gt;

The architects of the final building were [[Antonio Carlos (architect)|Antonio Carlos]], [[Eduardo Corona (architect)|Eduardo Corona]] and [[Roberto G. Tibau Pitombo]], and was constructed by [[Construtora Politécnica Ltda.]]&lt;ref name="Arquivo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="architecture" /&gt;

By the time of the 400th anniversary, the planetarium was still being constructed, and the projector was being held by customs in Santos; it wasn't released until June 1955, when it was subsequently placed into storage in [[Viveiro Manequinho Lopes]] in Ibirapuera Park. By the end of 1956 the construction of the building was completed, three years behind the initial schedule. This delay caused the cost of the originally-planned metal dome to soar from Cr$700,000 to Cr$5,000,000 due to exchange rate fluctuations, far in excess of the budget for it. As a result, [[José Carlos Figueiredo Ferraz]] designed and installed a concrete projection dome instead, which was the first time such material had been used for this type of structure.&lt;ref name="Prefeitura" /&gt;

The planetarium opened on 26 January 1957, at which time it was the only planetarium in Brazil; it was opened by Orsini, who subsequently led the initial operation of the planetarium, at the invitation of [[Maury de Freitas Julião]] and [[Wladimir de Toledo Pizza Sobrinho]].&lt;ref name="Prefeitura" /&gt;

The historical building is recorded by the [[Conselho Municipal de Preservação do Patrimônio Histórico, Cultural e Ambiental da Cidade de São Paulo]] (Conpresp; 1997) and [[Conselho de Defesa do Patrimônio Histórico, Arqueológico, Artístico e Turístico]] (Condephaat; 1992).&lt;ref name="Prefeitura" /&gt;

It closed in 1995–1997.&lt;ref name="folha_22Jan16" /&gt; In 1999 the building was closed by structural problems&lt;ref name="Prefeitura" /&gt; resulting in a roof leak,&lt;ref name="architecture" /&gt; as well as a [[termite]] infestation.&lt;ref name="informer" /&gt; It was restored at a cost of R$9.6 million,&lt;ref name="folha_22Jan16" /&gt; re-opening on 22 September 2006.&lt;ref name="informer" /&gt; During the restoration, led by Carl Zeiss AG, modern projectors were installed.&lt;ref name="architecture" /&gt;&lt;!-- On 22 March 2000 a municipal law was passed transferring operation of the planetarium and municipal school to the [[Universidade Aberta do Meio Ambiente]].&lt;ref name="Prefeitura" /&gt; – not sure how accurate this is, User:Mike_Peel 1Jan16 --&gt;

The planetarium closed in May 2013 for renovation after a lightning strike damaged the projector. It reopened on 24 January 2016, a day before the city's anniversary.&lt;ref name="Globo_24Jan16" /&gt;&lt;ref name="folha_22Jan16" /&gt;

== Planetarium ==
[[File:Professor Aristóteles Orsini Planetarium 2017 014.jpg|thumb|right|Inside the planetarium]]
The planetarium uses a [[Zeiss projector|Starmaster projector]], manufactured by [[Carl Zeiss AG]], which was installed in 2006 to replace the original Universarium III purchased in 1952. 44 additional projectors are also used.&lt;ref name="informer" /&gt; The projection dome has a capacity of 300 people, with a circular arrangement of reclining seats and projection at the top of the dome.&lt;ref name="Prefeitura" /&gt; The dome spans {{convert|18|m|ft}},&lt;ref name="Globo_24Jan16" /&gt;&lt;ref name="parque" /&gt; and is on one floor&lt;ref name="Arquivo" /&gt; with a [[mezzanine]].&lt;ref name="informer" /&gt; The metal and concrete half-dome is surrounded by a yellow disk, and the interior is made of wood.&lt;ref name="architecture" /&gt;

Planetarium shows last 30 minutes. The planetarium is open to pre-arranged school visits on Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays. It opens to the general public on Saturdays, Sundays, some holidays, and some weekdays in summer months via a ticket system, with 256 tickets available to the general public and 52 tickets reserved for disabled, pregnant, elderly or obese people and companions,&lt;ref name="Prefeitura" /&gt; with seven wheelchair spaces.&lt;ref name="parque" /&gt; In the 1990s it received around 350,000 visitors per year.&lt;ref name="informer" /&gt;

The planetarium is located around 5 minutes walk from the pedestrian Gate 10 of Ibirapuera Park,&lt;ref name="Prefeitura" /&gt; and is near to car parking at Gate 3.&lt;ref name="parque" /&gt;

== Municipal School of Astronomy ==
Adjacent to the planetarium is the Municipal School of Astronomy ({{lang-pt|Escola Municipal de Astrofísica Professor Aristóteles Orsini}}). It opened in January 1961 to teach astronomy courses, due to demand from the planetarium, which opened four years earlier. It has three classrooms, as well as a 100-seat auditorium. Courses range from introductory astronomy; solar system astronomy; stellar evolution; and cosmology. There is also an exhibition room, a reading room, and a telescope-building room.&lt;ref name="EMA" /&gt;

==Classification approach==

[[Image:SwainsonQuinarian.jpg|thumb|Swainson's Quinarian structure of birds]]

Quinarianism gets its name from the emphasis on the number five: it proposed that all taxa are divisible into five subgroups, and if fewer than five subgroups were known, quinarians believed that a missing subgroup remained to be found.&lt;ref name=ohara/&gt;

[[Image:VigorsQuinarian.jpg|thumb|left|[[Nicholas Aylward Vigors]]'s Quinarian classification of birds. The missing entries represented groups that he expected remained to be discovered.]]

Presumably this arose as a chance observation of some accidental analogies between different groups, but it was erected into a guiding principle by the quinarians. It became increasingly elaborate, proposing that each group of five classes could be arranged in a circle, with those closer together having greater affinities. Typically they were depicted with relatively advanced groups at the top, and supposedly degenerate forms towards the bottom. Each circle could touch or overlap with adjacent circles; the equivalent overlapping of actual groups in nature was called osculation&lt;!--don't link to the mathematics page of this name--&gt;.

[[Image:PtilotaQuinarian.jpg|thumb|[[William John Swainson]]'s arrangement of the insects, with analogies to the vertebrates]]

Another aspect of the system was the identification of ''analogies'' across groups:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= O’Hara, Robert J. |year=1991| title=Representations of the natural system in the nineteenth century| journal= Biology and Philosophy|volume= 6| issue=2| pages=255–274| url=http://rjohara.net/cv/1991-bp.html| doi=10.1007/bf02426840}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|[W]e shall consider that to be a natural system which endeavours to explain the multifarious relations which one object bears to another, not simply in their direct affinity, by which they follow each other like the links of a vast chain, but in their more remote relations [analogies], whereby they typify or represent other objects totally distinct in structure and organization from themselves|Swainson, 1835:197&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Swainson, W.|year=1835| title= A treatise on the geography and classification of animals| publisher= Longman, London|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k97034t }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Quinarianism was not widely popular outside the United Kingdom (some followers like William Hincks persisted in Canada&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal=Journal of the History of Biology |volume=35|pages= 5–42 |year= 2002| title= Quinarianism after Darwin’s Origin: The Circular System of William Hincks| author=Coggon, Jennifer|doi=10.1023/a:1014582710287}}&lt;/ref&gt;); it became unfashionable by the 1840s, during which time more complex "maps" were made by [[Hugh Edwin Strickland]] and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]].

{{DISPLAYTITLE:Rind ''et al''. controversy}}
The '''Rind ''et al''. controversy''' was a debate in the [[scientific literature]], public media, and government legislatures in the [[United States]] regarding a 1998 [[peer review]]ed [[meta-analysis]] of the self-reported harm caused by [[child sexual abuse]] (CSA).&lt;ref name = Rindetal&gt;{{cite journal | title = A Meta-Analytic Examination of Assumed Properties of Child Sexual Abuse Using College Samples | url = http://digilib.bc.edu/reserves/sc563/mcgu/sc56310.pdf | journal = [[Psychological Bulletin]] | last1= Rind| first1= B |author2= Tromovitch P Bauserman R | volume = 124 | issue = 1 | pages = 22–53 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9670820 | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.124.1.22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The debate resulted in the unprecedented condemnation of the paper by both Houses of the [[United States Congress]]. The [[social science]] research community was concerned that the condemnation by government legislatures might have a [[Chilling effect (law)|chilling effect]] on the future publication of controversial research results.

The study's [[lead author]] is psychologist [[Bruce Rind]], and it expanded on a 1997 meta-analysis for which Rind is also lead author.&lt;ref name=RindTromovitch&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rind |first1=B |author2=Tromovitch P |year=1997 |title=A meta-analytic review of findings from national samples on psychological correlates of child sexual abuse |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2372/is_n3_v34/ai_20444907 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041206114153/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2372/is_n3_v34/ai_20444907 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2004-12-06 |journal=[[The Journal of Sex Research]] |volume=34 |pages=237–255 |jstor=3813384 |doi=10.1080/00224499709551891 |issue=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors stated their goal was to determine whether CSA caused pervasive, significant psychological harm for both males and females, controversially concluding that the harm caused by child sexual abuse was not necessarily intense or pervasive,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=2007|title=National Samples, Sexual Abuse in Childhood, and Adjustment in Adulthood: A Commentary on Najman, Dunne, Purdie, Boyle, and Coxeter (2005) | url = http://www.esdy.edu.gr/files/011_Ygeias_Paidiou/Koinonikh_Paidiatrikh_tei_mathimata/A2_Rind%20Tromovitch%202005%20(2).pdf | format = PDF |journal= [[Archives of Sexual Behavior]] | volume=36 | pages = 101–106 | author1= Rind B |author2= Tromovitch P | doi = 10.1007/s10508-006-9058-y |pmid=17139555 |issue=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that the prevailing [[Construct (philosophy of science)|construct]] of CSA was not scientifically [[Validity (logic)|valid]], as it failed [[Empirical research|empirical verification]], and that the psychological damage caused by the abusive encounters depends on other factors such as the degree of coercion or force involved.&lt;ref name = Rindetal/&gt;  The authors concluded that even though CSA may not result in lifelong, significant harm to all victims, this does not mean it is not morally wrong and indicated that their findings did not imply current moral and legal prohibitions against CSA should be changed.&lt;ref name = Rindetal/&gt;

The Rind ''et al''. study has been criticized by various scientists and researchers, notably Stephanie Dallam (2001; 2002), on the grounds that its [[methodology]] and conclusions are poorly designed and statistically flawed.&lt;ref name="Glicken"&gt;{{cite book|author=Morley D.

==Studies and findings==
In 1997, [[psychology]] professor Bruce Rind from [[Temple University]] and doctoral student Philip Tromovitch from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] published a [[literature review]] in ''[[The Journal of Sex Research]]'' of seven studies regarding adjustment problems of victims of [[child sexual abuse]] (CSA).  To avoid the [[sampling bias]] that, they argued, existed in most studies of CSA (which drew from samples mostly in the [[mental health]] or [[legal system]]s and thus were, as a sample, unlike the population as a whole), the 1997 study combined data from studies using only national samples of individuals expected to be more representative of the population of child sexual abuse victims. This study examined 10 independent samples designed to be nationally representative, based on data from more than 8,500 participants. Four of the studies came from the United States, and one each came from Great Britain, Canada, and Spain.

Based on the results, they concluded that the general consensus associating CSA with intense, pervasive harm and long-term [[mental disorder|maladjustment]] was incorrect.&lt;ref name = RindTromovitch/&gt; The following year, Rind, Tromovitch and Robert Bauserman (then a professor at the [[University of Michigan]]) published a [[meta-analysis]] in the ''[[Psychological Bulletin]]'' of 59 studies (36 published studies, 21 unpublished doctoral dissertations, and 2 unpublished master's theses) with an aggregate sample size of 35,703 college students (13,704 men and 21,999 women). In most of the 59 studies, CSA was defined by the authors based on legal and moral criteria.

Integrating the sometimes disparate and conflicting definitions, CSA was defined as "a sexual interaction involving either physical contact or no contact (e.g., exhibitionism) between either a child or adolescent and someone significantly older, or between two peers who are children or adolescents when coercion is used." "Child" was sometimes defined, not biologically, but as [[Minor (law)|underaged]] or as a minor under the legal [[age of consent]].

All these studies were included in the meta-analysis because many CSA researchers, as well as lay persons, view all types of socio-legally defined CSA as morally and/or psychologically harmful.&lt;ref name = Rindetal/&gt; When this research, the U.S. Congress, and the APA refer to CSA and "children" in the context of sexual relations with adults, they are not referring simply to biological (prepubescent) children but to adolescents under the age of consent as well, which varies between 16 and 18 years old in the U.S.&lt;ref name="Rind 2000 1–62"&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/q771v3lq3x036122/ | last1= Rind | first1= B |author2= Tromovitch P; Bauserman R | year = 2000 | title = Condemnation of a scientific article: A chronology and refutation of the attacks and a discussion of threats to the integrity of science | journal = Sexuality and Culture | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 1–62 | doi = 10.1007/s12119-000-1025-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The results of the meta-analysis indicated that college students who had experienced CSA were slightly less well-adjusted compared to other students who had not experienced CSA, but that family environment was a significant [[Confounding|confound]] that may be responsible for the association between CSA and harm. Intense, pervasive harm and long-term [[mental disorder|maladjustment]] were due to [[Confounding|confounding variables]] in most studies rather than to the sexual abuse itself (though exceptions were noted for abuse accompanied by force or [[incest]]).&lt;ref name = Rindetal/&gt; Both studies addressed four "assumed properties" of CSA, identified by the authors: gender equivalence (both genders affected equally), causality (CSA causes harm), pervasiveness (most victims of CSA are harmed) and intensity (the harm is normally significant and long-term), concluding that all four "assumed properties" were questionable and had several potential confounds.&lt;ref name = Rindetal/&gt;&lt;ref name = RindTromovitch/&gt;

Based on the closely mirrored results of both studies, Rind, Tromovitch and Bauserman questioned the scientific [[Internal validity|validity]] of a single term "child sexual abuse" and suggested a variety of different labels for sexual contact between adults and non-adults based on age and the degree to which the child was forced or coerced into participating.  They concluded with a discussion of the legal and moral implications of the article, stating that the "wrongfulness" and "harmfulness" of sexual acts are not inherently linked, and finished with the statement:
{{quote|the findings of the current review do not imply that moral or legal definitions of or views on behaviors currently classified as CSA should be abandoned or even altered. The current findings are relevant to moral and legal positions only to the extent that these positions are based on the presumption of psychological harm.|Rind ''et al''. (1998) p. 47}}

==Controversy==
The paper was first published by the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) in July, 1998, in ''[[Psychological Bulletin]]'' to little reaction, though strong reactions were ultimately demonstrated by [[Social conservativism|social conservatives]] / [[Fundamentalism|religious fundamentalists]], and [[Psychotherapy|psychotherapists]] and [[Psychiatry|psychiatrists]] who treat victims of sexual abuse who were concerned about the implications.  The first substantial and public reaction was a December criticism by the [[National Association for Research &amp; Therapy of Homosexuality]], an organization dedicated to the discredited view that homosexuality is a mental illness that can be cured by psychotherapy.&lt;ref name = Tavris&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Tavris | first1 = C. | authorlink = Carol Tavris| title = The uproar over sexual abuse research and its findings | doi = 10.1007/BF02912285 | journal = Society | volume = 37 | issue = 4 | pages = 15–17 | year = 2000 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1999, talk show host [[Laura Schlessinger]] criticized the study as "[[junk science]]" and stated that since its conclusions were contrary to conventional wisdom, its findings should never have been released. She criticized the study's use of meta-analysis, saying. "I frankly have never seen this in general science. ... This [pooling of studies] is so outrageous!"&lt;ref&gt;Schlessinger, L. (1999 March 23) The Dr. Laura show [Radio Broadcast] Los Angeles, CA: Premiere Radio Networks.&lt;/ref&gt; "This was not a study! They didn’t do a study! They arbitrarily found 59 studies that other people had done [and] combined them all."

Shortly thereafter, the [[North American Man/Boy Love Association]] posted an approving review of the study on their website, furthering the impression that the piece was an endorsement of [[pedophilia]].&lt;ref name = Lilienfeld2002&gt;{{cite journal | last = Lilienfeld | first = SO |authorlink1=Scott Lilienfeld |year = 2002 | url = http://www.haverford.edu/psych/ble/SciSoc/lilienfeld02.pdf  | title = When Worlds Collide: Social Science, Politics and the Rind ''et al''.

In the process Delay confused the American Psychological Association with the [[American Psychiatric Association]], an error also made by Schlessinger.&lt;ref name = Lilienfeld2002/&gt;

In response, the APA declared in a [[press statement]] that [[child sexual abuse]] is harmful and wrong, and that the study was in no way an endorsement of pedophilia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/julaug99/as4.html |title=APA defends stance against the sexual abuse of children.

In an internal organization email, APA Executive Vice-President [[Raymond D. Fowler]] stated that because of the controversy, the article's methodology, analysis and the process by which it had been approved for publication was reviewed and found to be sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Fowler | first = RD | authorlink = Raymond D. Fowler | year = 1999 | title = RE: APA statements | publisher = Child Maltreatment Researchers (Mailing List) | url = http://www.mhamic.org/rind/fowler2.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In June 1999, Fowler announced in an open letter to DeLay that there would be an independent review of the paper and stated that from a [[public policy]] perspective, some language used in the article was inflammatory and inconsistent with the position of the APA's stance on CSA.  The APA also implemented a series of actions designed to prevent the study from being used in legal circumstances to defend CSA and stated an independent review would be undertaken of the scientific accuracy and validity of the report.&lt;ref name="delay" /&gt; The request for an outside review of a controversial report by an independent scientific association was unprecedented in APA's 107-year history.&lt;ref name = Lilienfeld2002/&gt;

In April 1999, a [[Resolution (law)|resolution]] was introduced in the [[Alaska Legislature]] condemning the article, with similar resolutions introduced in California, Illinois, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Pennsylvania over the subsequent two months.  Some of these states' psychological associations reacted by asking the APA to take action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 1999, the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS), upon a request by the APA to independently review the article, stated that it saw no reason to second-guess the peer review process that approved it initially and that it saw no evidence of improper methodology or questionable practices by the authors.  The AAAS also expressed concern that the materials reviewed demonstrated a grave lack of understanding of the study on the part of the media and politicians and were also concerned about the misrepresentation of its findings.&lt;ref name="Rind 2000 1–62"/&gt;  The AAAS stated that the responsibility for discovering problems with the article lay with the initial peer reviewers, and declined to evaluate the article, concluding with a statement that the decision to not review the article was neither an endorsement, nor a criticism of it.

In August 2000, the APA drafted and adopted a position statement in response to the Rind ''et al''. controversy that opposed any efforts to [[censorship|censor]] controversial or surprising research findings and asserting that researchers must be free to investigate and report findings as long as the research has been conducted within appropriate ethical and research standards.&lt;ref name = Lilienfeld2002/&gt;

==Criticism and response==
A series of 2001 papers published in the ''[[Journal of Child Sexual Abuse]]'' discussed and criticized the findings of the Rind ''et al''. study. Stephanie Dallam stated that, after reviewing the evidence, the paper was best described as "an advocacy article that inappropriately uses science in an attempt to legitimatize its findings".&lt;ref name="Dallam"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Science or Propaganda?

Lilienfeld reported this subsequent rejection on several psychology [[Internet forum|Internet fora]], which produced an intense response and resulted in the APA and ''American Psychologist'' ultimately printing the article as part of a special issue focusing on the controversy.&lt;ref name = Rind2006/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/special/4015703.aspx | editors = Albee GW; Newcombe NS; McCarthy R | year = 2002 | volume = 57 | issue = 3 | title = Interactions Among Scientists and Policymakers: Challenges and Opportunities | pages = 164–227 | journal = [[American Psychologist]] | doi = &lt;!-- none, whole issue--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possible sample bias===
The paper has been criticized for restricting its analysis to convenience samples of college students, possibly introducing [[Systematic error|systematic bias]] by excluding victims so traumatized that they did not go on to attend college. Another possibility was that Rind ''et al''.'s conclusions may not be generalizable beyond college populations in general as individuals with a history of CSA were more likely than non-abused individuals to drop out of college after a single semester.&lt;ref name = Dallam/&gt;&lt;ref name = Spiegel2000&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Spiegel | first1 = D. | title = Suffer the children: Long-term effects of sexual abuse | journal = Society | volume = 37 | issue = 4 | pages = 18–20| year = 2000 | doi = 10.1007/BF02912286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rind, Bauserman and Tromovitch responded to this criticism by saying that "the representativeness of college samples is in fact irrelevant to the stated goals and conclusions of our study" since the purpose of their research was "to examine the validity of the clinical concept" of CSA. They added that according to the commonly understood definition of the term, child sexual abuse is extremely and pervasively harmful, meaning that "in any population sampled - drug addicts, psychiatric patients, or college students - persons who have experienced CSA should show strong evidence of the assumed properties of CSA."  The authors of the study say that because the college sample did not show pervasive harm, "the broad and unqualified claims about the properties of CSA are contradicted".&lt;ref name = "Rind2001"&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Rind | first1= B |author2= Tromovitch P; Bauserman R | year = 2001 | title = The validity and appropriateness of methods, analyses, and conclusions in Rind ''et al''.

===Non-standardization of variables===
Dallam ''et al''. said that Rind ''et al''. did not standardize their definition of child sexual abuse, leaving out certain studies that were appropriate, and including studies that were inappropriate. That is, they allege that Rind ''et al''. uncritically combined data from studies of CSA with data from studies looking at other phenomena such as consensual peer experiences, sexual experiences that occurred during adulthood, and homosexual approaches during adolescence.&lt;ref name = Dallam/&gt;

Rind, ''et al''. have also responded to this criticism, defending the appropriateness of including all five of the studies (Landis, 1956;&lt;ref name = Landis&gt;{{cite journal | title = Experiences of 500 children with adult sexual deviation. | url = http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1957-08328-001 | journal = Psychiatric Quarterly Supplement | last = Landis| first = J | volume = 30 | pages = 91–109 | year = 1956}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schultz and Jones, 1983;&lt;ref name = SchultzAndJones&gt;{{cite journal | title = Sexual abuse of children: Issues for social science and health professionals | journal = Child Welfare | last1= Schultz | first1= LG |author2= Jones P | volume = 62 | pages = 99–109 | year = 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sedney and Brooks, 1984;&lt;ref name = SedneyAndBrooks&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002713809601424 | title = Factors associated with a history of childhood sexual experience in a nonclinical female population | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Child Psychiatry | last1= Sedney | first1= M |author2= Brooks B | volume = 23 | issue = 2 | pages = 215–218 | year = 1984 | doi = 10.1097/00004583-198403000-00015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenwald, 1994;&lt;ref name = Greenwald1994&gt;{{cite thesis |type=Ph.D. |first=J |last=Greenwald |title=Romantic and sexual self-esteem, a new construct: Its relationship to current and early childhood sexual experiences |publisher=University of Nebraska—Lincoln |year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Sarbo, 1985&lt;ref name = Sarbo1985&gt;{{cite thesis |type=Ph.D. |first=A |last=Sarbo |title=Childhood molestations: Adult personality correlates and predictors of trauma |publisher=Georgia State University |year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;) specifically identified by Dallam ''et al''. as inappropriate to a study about child sexual abuse.&lt;ref name = Rind2001/&gt;

Dallam ''et al''. said that the first three studies focused on all types of child sexual activity, not just child sexual abuse.&lt;ref name = Dallam/&gt; Rind ''et al''. reject this criticism. In regard to the Landis study, Rind ''et al''. note that it has been used by many other sex researchers (e.g., Finkelhor, Fishman, Fromuth &amp; Burkhart, Sarbo, and others) as an example of an early study about child sexual abuse. In regard to  the Shultz and Jones study, Rind ''et al''. concede that the study "looked at all types of 'sexual acts' before age 12," but explained that the respondents in the study were all asked "if their experience was with a person over the age of 16," thus allowing Rind ''et al''. to include only the relationships that were age-discrepant. In regard to the Sedney and Brooks study, Rind ''et al''. admit that the study used a broad definition of child sexual abuse, but explain that the researchers themselves chose to use such a definition "because of the difficulty posed by a priori decisions about what type of sexual experiences are 'problems.'"

Similarly, psychiatrist David Spiegel said that the inclusion of Landis' 1956 study&lt;ref name = Landis/&gt; was unjustified.&lt;ref name = Spiegel2000/&gt;&lt;ref name = Spiegel2000SC&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Price of Abusing Children and Numbers | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/9673501453212135/ | journal = Sexuality &amp; Culture | last = Spiegel| first = DJ | volume = 4 | issue = 2| pages = 63–66 | year = 2000 | doi = 10.1007/s12119-000-1026-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that, while weighting larger studies more than smaller makes sense, combining the results of a large study examining very mild trauma (such as fending off an attacker) with studies of long-term physical and sexual abuse was inappropriate and led to erroneous conclusions.&lt;ref name = Spiegel2000/&gt; Rind ''et al''. replied that Spiegel misrepresented their analysis, since they did not use Landis' study in the meta-analysis of childhood sexual abuse – symptom correlations, but only for examining the self-reported effects of CSA. They contend that the way they handled Landis' data maximized negative reports and minimized the possible deflating effect of Landis' data on the overall effect sizes.&lt;ref name = RindSC&gt;{{cite journal | title = Debunking the False Allegations of "Statistical Abuse": A Reply to Spiegel | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/r25520x3n4l7263u/ | journal = Sexuality &amp; Culture | last1= Rind| first1= B |author2= Bauserman R, Tromovitch P | volume = 4 | issue = 2| pages = 101–111 | year = 2000 | doi = 10.1007/s12119-000-1029-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last two studies, according to Dallam ''et al''., were inappropriate because they included respondents who were over the age of 17 when the CSA occurred. Persons 18 years old or older are above the legal age of consent in all states of the USA, and thus are not "children" even in the loosest definition of the term. Rind ''et al''. responded to Dallam ''et al''. by saying that, in the effect-size calculations of the Sarbo and Greenwald studies (i.e., the calculations that show the alleged harmfulness of CSA), they had included only respondents aged 16 and 15 and under, respectively, at the time of the CSA&lt;ref name = Rind2001/&gt; and all CSA incidents included in Sarbo's and Greenwald's original analysis occurred before the age of 17.&lt;ref name = Rind2006/&gt;{{rp|p.177}}

===Measured variables===
Spiegel criticized that Rind ''et al''. included a long list of measured variables in order to appear comprehensive, but remarkably omitted [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] - "the most salient symptom" - from their analysis.&lt;ref name = Spiegel2000SC/&gt;{{rp|65}} Rind ''et al''. replied that including PTSD was impossible due to the fact that the original studies did not examine it.&lt;ref name = RindSC/&gt; Furthermore, they cited Kendall-Tackett ''et al''.&lt;ref name="KenTacket"/&gt; to illustrate the lack of a common pattern of symptoms in children who have been abused.

===Consent===
David Spiegel also argued that Rind ''et al''.'s suggestion of relabeling some forms of sexual encounters between adults and children/adolescents as adult-child (or adult-adolescent) sex is fundamentally flawed, because children cannot give meaningful consent to sexual relations with an adult.&lt;ref name = Spiegel2000SC/&gt;&lt;ref name = Spiegel2000SCb&gt;{{cite journal | title = Real Effects of Real Child Sexual Abuse | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/g22w44hg807482ku/ | journal = Sexuality &amp; Culture | last = Spiegel| first = DJ | volume = 4 | issue = 4| pages = 99–105 | year = 2000 | doi = 10.1007/s12119-000-1006-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics also argued that using value-neutral terminology would normalize CSA and that redefining terminology is not in the interest of the general public because it confuses the underlying moral issues.&lt;ref name="Rind 2000 1–62"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dallam"/&gt; Rind ''et al''. replied that the construct of consent used in their study was misinterpreted by critics; they only asserted that children/adolescents are capable of simple consent (willingness) as opposed to informed consent used in legal contexts, and used this as a variable in their study simply because it was used in the original studies - where it had predictive validity.&lt;ref name="Rind 2000 1–62"/&gt;&lt;ref name = RindSC/&gt; Thus, they conclude that although the construct of willingness might be morally unacceptable, it is a scientifically valid term. A similar argument was put forward by Oellerich,&lt;ref name = Oellerich&gt;{{cite journal | title = Rind, Tromovitch, and Bauserman: Politically Incorrect-Scientifically Correct | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/16328257h71413q8/ | journal = Sexuality &amp; Culture | last = Spiegel| first = DJ | volume = 4 | issue = 2| pages = 67–81 | year = 2000 | doi = 10.1007/s12119-000-1027-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; who stated that considering all adult/non-adult sexual behavior as abusive and lacking consent can lead to bias in scientific research in the area, and that recognizing this distinction does not necessarily lead to considering adult/non-adult sexual interactions as morally permissible.

===Statistical errors===
Dallam ''et al''. also contend that Rind ''et al''. miscoded or misreported significant amounts of the underlying study data, thereby skewing the results. Dallam ''et al''. contend that Rind ''et al''. incorrectly used "[[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|Pearson's r]]" instead of "[[Cohen's d]]" to calculate the effect size, which resulted in a failure to correct for base-rate differences of CSA in male and female samples, and which led to the finding that males were less harmed by CSA.  After correcting for base-rate attenuation, Dallam ''et al''. said they arrived at identical effect sizes for [[male]] and [[female]] samples.&lt;ref name = Dallam2001/&gt;

In response to this criticism, Rind ''et al''. contend that they did indeed describe the contrast between the effect size estimates as "nonsignificant, z = 1.42, p &gt; .10, two-tailed".  However, they argue, "What [they] did report as significantly different was the contrast between male and female effect size estimates for the all-types-of-consent groups, where ''r&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;s'' = .04 and .11, respectively. In "follow[ing] Dallam ''et al''. (2001) [by] apply[ing] Becker's correction formula to these values, they become r&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;s = .06 and .12 for men and women, respectively.  The contrast is still statistically significant (z = 2.68, p &lt; .01. two-tailed), contrary to Dallam ''et al''.'s (2001) claim".&lt;ref name = "Rind2001"/&gt;

Rind ''et al''. said that their own "handling of Pearson's r in the face of base-rate differences was methodologically proper and produced no important bias, if any at all."  Furthermore, they contend that Dallam's criticisms "exhibited bias ... [by] selectively ignoring key clarifying quotes ... and citing them elsewhere in their critique to argue different points, and [by] ignoring or overlooking a key caveat by Becker (1986) regarding appropriate use of his correction formula".&lt;ref name = "Rind2001"/&gt;

Critics also argued that Rind ''et al''.'s statistical approach for controlling for family environment as a cause of maladjustment was conceptually and methodologically invalid. Spiegel stated that inferring the source of maladjustment from analyzing the shared variance between CSA and family environment does not answer the question of which variable explains maladjustment better;&lt;ref name = Spiegel2000SC/&gt;&lt;ref name = Spiegel2000SCb/&gt; the authors answered that this statement shows a misunderstanding of the statistical procedure used their meta-analysis.&lt;ref name="Rind 2000 1–62"/&gt; Dallam, however, addressed the topic of several prior studies having found statistically significant relations between CSA and maladjustment even after controlling for family environment.&lt;ref name="Dallam"/&gt;

===Conceptual issues===
Rind ''et al''.'s model of "assumed properties of child sexual abuse," (that is, of universal and pervasive harm in all victims of CSA) has been criticized as a [[straw man]] assertion in that it is both simplistic and misleading.&lt;ref name="Ondersma"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Sex with children is abuse: Comment on Rind, Tromovitch, and Bauserman (1998) | url = http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2001-05308-001 | journal=Psychol Bull |volume=127 |issue=6 |pages=707–714 |date=November 2001 |pmid=11726067 |doi= 10.1037/0033-2909.127.6.707 |last1=Ondersma| first1=S.J. |last2=Chaffin |first2=Mark |last3=Berliner |first3=Lucy |last4=Cordon |first4=Ingrid |last5=Goodman |first5=Gail S |last6=Barnett |first6=D|quote=The authors...argue for the appropriateness of the term 'abuse' and for scientific terminology that reflects, rather than contradicts, consensual public morality. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McNally"&gt;{{cite journal | last = McNally | first = RJ | year = 2003 | title = Progress and controversy in the study of posttraumatic stress disorder | pmid = 12172002 | journal = [[Annual Review of Psychology]] | volume = 54 | pages = 229–252 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.psych.54.101601.145112 | format = PDF | url = http://www.subjectpool.com/ed_teach/y4person/4_ant_bpd/McNally_AnnRev_%282003%29_PTSD.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reactions of victims in their adult lives have been found to be extremely varied, ranging from severe to nearly unnoticeable, and many pathologies are not diagnosable in the strictly clinical sense Rind uses. Victims often have a flawed or distorted appraisal of their abuse, and fail to connect distressing and sometimes debilitating pathologies with their experiences. Further, these studies make no accounting for emotional support of the victim's family, clinical treatment of the victim prior to the study, or personal resiliency, which can easily account for less severe outcomes.&lt;ref name="McCoy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ondersma" /&gt;

===Possible bias===
Rind, Bauserman and Tromovitch stated that research findings can be skewed by an investigator's personal biases, and in Rind ''et al''. claimed that "[r]eviewers who are convinced that CSA is a major cause of adult psychopathology may fall prey to confirmation bias by noting and describing study findings indicating harmful effects but ignoring or paying less attention to findings indicating nonnegative outcomes".  They defended their deliberate choice of non-legal and non-clinical samples, accordingly avoiding individuals who received psychological treatment or were engaged in legal proceedings as a way of correcting this bias through the use of a sample of college students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.ipce.info/library_2/rbt/skept.htm | last1= Rind | first1= B |author2= Bauserman R; Tromovitch P | year = 2001 | title = The condemned meta-analysis on child sexual abuse; Good science and long-overdue skepticism | journal = Skeptical Inquirer | pages = 68–72 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dallam and Anne Salter have stated that Rind and Bauserman have associated with age of consent reform organizations in the past.  In the years before the paper was written, both Rind and Bauserman had published articles in ''Paidika: The Journal of Paedophilia'', a journal which was dedicated to "[demonstrating] that pedophilia has been, and remains, a legitimate and productive part of the totality of human experience".&lt;ref name=Salter&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Salter | first = A | title = Predators: pedophiles, rapists, and other sex offenders: who they are, how they operate, and how we can protect ourselves and our children | year = 2003 | publisher = [[Basic Books]] | location = New York  | isbn = 0-465-07172-4 | page = [https://books.google.ca/books?id=KcUpHDawtCAC&amp;pg=PA64#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 64] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, Dallam and Salter stated that Rind and Bauserman were keynote speakers at a pedophile advocacy conference occurring in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name = Salter/&gt;  Another article described Bauserman and Tromovitch's involvement as "[presenting] their meta-analytic findings to a group of clinicians in the Netherlands [and] Robert Bauserman (1989), had published an article in ''Paidika'', a Dutch journal that had previously featured manuscripts tolerant of pedophilia".&lt;ref name = Lilienfeld2002/&gt;

==Usage outside of scholarly discussions==
Despite the authors' comments that the findings of the paper "do not imply that moral or legal definitions of or views on behaviors currently classified as CSA" should be changed,&lt;ref name = Rindetal/&gt;  it caught the attention of, and was used by, [[Age of consent reform#Pedophile advocacy|advocates for pedophilia]].&lt;ref name="spiegel" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ondersma/&gt;  The paper was cited, reviewed, and posted to the Internet by numerous advocacy groups. It has been used to argue that the [[age of consent]] should be lowered or abolished,&lt;ref name= Dallam2001&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1= Dallam | first1= SJ |display-authors=etal | title = The effects of child sexual abuse: Comment on Rind, Tromovitch, and Bauserman (1998) | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 127 | issue = 6 | pages = 715–33 | year = 2001 | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.127.6.715 | issn = 0033-2909 | pmid = 11726068 | url = http://digilib.bc.edu/reserves/sc563/mcgu/sc56311.pdf | format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it has been used in criminal court in the U.S. by attorneys defending those accused of child sexual offenses.&lt;ref name=Dallam2001/&gt;

[[Social psychology|Social psychologist]] [[Carol Tavris]] noted several other groups that reacted negatively to the study. The anti-homosexuality group [[National Association for Research &amp; Therapy of Homosexuality]] (NARTH), who "[endorse] the long-discredited psychoanalytic notion that homosexuality is a mental disorder and that it is a result of seduction in childhood by an adult",&lt;ref name = Tavris/&gt; objected to the study's implications that boys who are sexually abused are not traumatized for life and do not become homosexuals as a result.  Therapists who supported the existence of [[recovered memory|recovered memories]] and [[recovered-memory therapy]], as well as those who attributed mental illnesses such as [[dissociative identity disorder]], [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] and [[eating disorder]]s to repressed memories of sexual abuse also rejected the study.  Tavris attributed this rejection to the fear of [[malpractice]] lawsuits.  Tavris herself believed that the study could have been interpreted positively as an example of [[psychological resilience]] in the face of adversity, and noted that CSA causing little or no harm in some individuals is not an endorsement of the act, nor does it make it any less illegal.&lt;ref name = Tavris/&gt;

==Subsequent research and legacy==

Numerous studies and professional clinical experience in the field of psychology, both before and after Rind ''et al''.'s publications, have long supported the stance that children cannot consent to sexual activity and that child and adolescent sexual abuse cause harm. The then American Psychological Association CEO Raymond D. Fowler succinctly reiterated the prevailing view in a 1999 letter to Congressman Delay "that children cannot consent to sexual activity with adults," and "sexual activity between children and adults should never be considered or labeled as harmless or acceptable".&lt;ref name="Ondersma" /&gt;&lt;ref name="delay"&gt;{{cite press release |title=American Psychological Association Letter to the Honorable Rep.

A study published in The ''[[Scientific Review of Mental Health Practice]]'' attempted to replicate the Rind study, correcting for methodological and statistical problems identified by Dallam and others. It supported some of the Rind findings, both with respect to the percentage of variance in later psychological outcomes accounted for by sexual abuse and in relation to the finding that there was a gender difference in the experience of child sexual abuse, such that females reported more negative effects. It, however, acknowledged the limitations of the findings (college student sample, [[Self-report study#Disadvantages|self-report data]]), and did not endorse Rind's recommendation to abandon the use of the term ''child sexual abuse'' in cases of apparent consent in favor of the term ''adult-child sex.'' In their conclusion, the authors address the objection that Rind's work and their own would give support to those who deny that child sexual abuse can cause harm: "The authors of the current research would hesitate to support such a general statement. Instead, our results, and the results of the Rind ''et al''. meta-analysis, can be interpreted as providing a hopeful and positive message to therapists, parents, and children. Child sexual abuse does not necessarily lead to long-term harm."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.srmhp.org/0402/child-abuse.html | title = Child Sexual Abuse: A Replication of the Meta-analytic Examination of Child Sexual Abuse by Rind, Tromovitch, and Bauserman (1998)| date = June 2005 | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | last1= Ulrich | first1= Heather |author2= Randolph Mickey, Acheson Shawn | journal = The Scientific Review of Mental Health Practice }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been greater emphasis in subsequent work on the range of responses that are possible from victims. For example, a few studies make reference to the paper's findings about "consensual" encounters, but approach it from the opposite direction (i.e., that the use of force causes more intense negative outcomes).&lt;ref name=Senn&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Senn | first1 = TE | last2 = Carey | first2 = MP | last3 = Vanable | first3 = PA | last4 = Coury-Doniger | first4 = P | last5 = Urban | first5 = M | title = Characteristics of Sexual Abuse in Childhood and Adolescence Influence Sexual Risk Behavior in Adulthood | journal = Arch Sex Behav | volume = 36 | issue = 5 | pages = 637–45 |date=Oct 2007 | doi = 10.1007/s10508-006-9109-4 | pmid = 17192833  | pmc = 2042031 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Heather Ulrich, author of the aforementioned replication of the meta-analysis, later drew on the findings to study the reasons for the variability in outcomes of CSA victims, such as attributional style (individual's causal explanations for why the abuse occurred), family environment, and social support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Ulrich | first = Heather | title = Examining the variability in the long term adjustment of child sexual abuse victims | url = http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-09202007-123302/unrestricted/umi-umt-1028.pdf | format = PDF | publisher = University of Montana | date = June 9, 2007 | accessdate = 14 July 2011 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111007165739/http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-09202007-123302/unrestricted/umi-umt-1028.pdf | archivedate = 7 October 2011 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7523">The '''Shuttle Amateur Radio Experiment''' (SAREX), later called the '''Space Amateur Radio Experiment''', was a program that promoted and supported the use of [[amateur radio|amateur ("ham") radio]] by [[astronaut]]s in low earth orbit aboard the [[United States]] [[Space Shuttle]] to communicate with other [[amateur radio station]]s around the world. It was superseded by the [[Amateur Radio on the International Space Station]] (ARISS) program. SAREX was sponsored by [[NASA]], [[AMSAT]] (The Radio Amateur Satellite Corporation), and the [[ARRL]] (American Radio Relay League).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kelley|first=Mark|title=Radio in Space: In the Beginning There Was SAREX|url=http://www.dxcoffee.com/eng/2011/08/10/radio-space-beginning-sarex/|publisher=DXCOFFEE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Shortly after the launch of [[STS-9]], On November 28, 1983 Owen Garriott (W5LFL) became the first amateur radio operator active in space.  Garriott had already flown on [[Skylab 3]], but did not operate radio equipment on that trip.  On STS-9, he used a handheld [[2-meter band|2-meter]] radio to  talk to his mother, senator [[Barry Goldwater]], [[Hussein of Jordan|King Hussein of Jordan]] (JY1), and many others. Garriott made approximately 300 calls and convinced NASA that amateur radio was useful to get students involved in space.  Thus began the Space Amateur Radio Experiment, also known as SAREX.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kelley|first=Mark|title=Radio in Space: In the Beginning There Was SAREX|url=http://www.dxcoffee.com/eng/2011/08/10/radio-space-beginning-sarex/|publisher=DXCOFFEE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Netting|first=Ruth|title=Ham Radios in Space|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2000/ast21aug_1/|publisher=NASA|accessdate=28 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The second successful use of amateur radio in space was carried out by [[Anthony W. England]] (W0ORE) on ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'' flight [[STS-51F]] in 1985. He completed 130 contacts and sent 10 images via [[slow-scan television]]. In 1991, [[STS-37]] became the first voyage to space on which the entire crew were licensed amateur radio operators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SAREX|url=http://www.spacetoday.org/Satellites/Hamsats/SAREX.html|publisher=Space Today Online|accessdate=28 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After these flights, amateur radios were often taken on the shuttles, as many as twenty-five before the program became known as ARISS. Licensed hams were able to participate during their free time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Petty|first=John|title=International Space Station Reference|url=http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/station/reference/radio/sarex.html|publisher=NASA|accessdate=28 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational uses==
Most amateur radio operators used SAREX to speak with licensed astronauts during their down times. SAREX, however, has been very educational for young students from kindergarten to fifth grade involved in a program similar to young astronauts, in which elementary school children learn about astronauts' daily activities and what it is like in space. Students also have had the opportunity to communicate via video when the shuttles have had suitable equipment. Teachers have found out about how to link their classes with the SAREX program through the Amateur Radio in Space Guide distributed by NASA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amateur Radio in Space-- A Teachers Guide with Activities in Science, Mathematics, and Technology|url=http://teacherlink.ed.usu.edu/tlnasa/units/AmateurRadio/Part03.pdf|publisher=NASA|accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Licensing==

An [[Amateur_radio#Licensing_requirements|amateur operator license]] is needed before operating an amateur station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SAREX Field Operations Guide, Draft Version 2.1a: Technical and Engineering Reference: FCC Rules and Regulations|url=http://www.datasync.com/~w8je/uguide/uguide7d.html|date=January 28, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The license can be obtained from the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]]'s (FCC) Amateur Radio Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amateur Radio Service: Licensing|url=http://wireless.fcc.gov/services/index.htm?job=licensing&amp;id=amateur|publisher=Federal Communications Commission: Wireless Telecommunications Bureau|accessdate=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; No special SAREX license is required for operation, but certain regulations come into play for space communications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SAREX Field Operations Guide, Draft Version 2.1a: Technical and Engineering Reference: FCC Rules and Regulations|url=http://www.datasync.com/~w8je/uguide/uguide7d.html|date=January 28, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{political anthropology}}
'''State formation''' is the process of the development of a centralized government structure in a situation where one did not exist prior to its development.  State formation has been a study of many disciplines of the [[social science]]s for a number of years, so much so that Jonathan Haas writes that "One of the favorite pastimes of social scientists over the course of the past century has been to theorize about the evolution of the world's great civilizations."{{sfn|Haas|1982|p=1}} The study of state formation is divided generally into either the study of early states (those that developed in [[Stateless society|stateless societies]]) or the study of modern states (particularly of the form that developed in Europe in the 17th century and spread around the world). Academic debate about various theories is a prominent feature in fields like Anthropology, Sociology, Economics and Political Science.{{sfn|Barkey|Parikh|1991|p=523}}

==The state==
{{main|State (polity)}}
A state is a political system with a centralized government, a military force, a civil service, an arranged society, and literacy. Though, there is no clear agreement on the defining characteristics of a state and the definition can vary significantly, based upon the focus of the particular definition.{{sfn|Haas|1982|pp=2-3}} The state is considered to be territoriality bound and is distinct from tribes or units without centralized institutions.{{sfn|Cohen|1978|pp=2-5}}

According to Painter &amp; Jeffrey, there are 5 distinctive features of the modern state:

1) They are ordered by precise boundaries with administrative control across the whole;

2) They occupy large territories with control given to organized institutions;

3) They have a capital city and are endowed with symbols that embody state power;

4) The government within state creates organizations to monitor, govern and control its population through surveillance and record keeping;

5) They increase monitoring over time.{{sfn|Painter|Jeffrey|2009|pp=22-24}}

Additionally, Herbst holds that there is another relevant characteristic of modern states: [[nationalism]]. This feeling of belonging to a certain territory plays a central role in state formation since it increases citizens' willingness to pay taxes.{{sfn|Herbst|1990}}

==Explaining early states and explaining modern states==
Theories of state formation have two distinct focuses, depending largely on the field of study:

# The early transition in human society from tribal communities into larger political organizations.  Studies of this topic, often in [[anthropology]], explore the initial development of basic administrative structures in areas where states developed from stateless societies.{{sfn|Spruyt|2002|p=129}} Although state formation was an active research agenda in anthropology and archaeology until the 1980s, some of the effort has changed to focus not on why these states formed but on how they operated.{{sfn|Marcus|Feinman|1998|p=3}} 
# In contrast, studies in [[political science]] and in [[sociology]] have focused significantly on the formation of the modern state.{{sfn|Spruyt|2002|p=131}}

Sandeford as socially stratified and bureaucratically governed societies with at least four levels of settlement hierarchy (e.g., a large capital, cities, villages, and hamlets). Primary states are those state societies that developed in regions where no states existed before. These states developed by strictly internal processes and interaction with other non-states societies.{{sfn|Sandeford|2018}} The exact number of cases which qualify as primary states is not clearly known because of limited information about political organization before the development of writing in many places,{{sfn|Wright|1977|p=386}} but Sandeford lists ten likely cases of primary state formation in Eurasia, the Americas, and the Pacific.{{sfn|Sandeford|2018}}

Studies on the formation of '''early states''' tend to focus on processes that create and institutionalize a state in a situation where a state did not exist before. Examples of early states which developed in interaction with other states include the [[Aegean civilizations|Aegean Bronze Age Greek civilizations]] and the [[Malagasy culture#Madagascar|Malagasy civilization in Madagascar]].{{sfn|Wright|2006|p=306}} Unlike primary state formation, early state formation does not require the creation of the first state in that cultural context or development autonomously, independently from state development nearby. Early state formation causation can thus include borrowing, imposition, and other forms of interaction with already existing states.{{sfn|Cohen|1978|p=50}}

===Modern state formation===
Theories on the formation of modern states focus on the processes that support the development of modern states, particularly those that formed in late-medieval Europe and then spread around the world with colonialism. Starting in the 1940s and 1950s, with [[decolonization]] processes underway, attention began to focus on the formation and construction of modern states with significant bureaucracies, ability to tax, and territorial sovereignty around the world.{{sfn|Southall|1974|p=153}}{{sfn|Spruyt|2002|p=132}} However, some scholars hold that the modern state model formed in other parts of the world prior to colonialism, but that colonial structures replaced it.{{sfn|Blanton|Fargher|2008|p=13}}

==Theories about early state development==
There are a number of different theories and hypotheses regarding early state formation that seek generalizations to explain why the state developed in some places but not others. Other scholars believe that generalizations are unhelpful and that each case of early state formation should be treated on its own.{{sfn|Spencer|Redmond|2004|p=174}}

===Voluntary theories===
[[File:City context.svg|thumb|right|Uruk one of the prime sites for research into early state formation]]
Voluntary theories contend that diverse groups of people came together to form states as a result of some shared rational interest.{{sfn|Carneiro|1970|p=733}} The theories largely focus on the development of agriculture, and the population and organizational pressure that followed and resulted in state formation.  The argument is that such pressures result in integrative pressure for rational people to unify and create a state.{{sfn|Service|1978|p=21}} Much of the [[social contract]] philosophical tradition proposed a voluntary theory for state formation.{{sfn|Service|1978|pp=21-23}}

One of the most prominent theories of early and primary state formation is the ''hydraulic hypothesis'', which contends that the state was a result of the need to build and maintain large-scale irrigation projects.{{sfn|Service|1978|p=30}} The theory was most significantly detailed [[Karl August Wittfogel]]'s argument that, in arid environments, farmers would be confronted by the production limits of small-scale irrigation. Eventually different agricultural producers would join together in response to population pressure and the arid environment, to create a state apparatus that could build and maintain large irrigation projects.{{sfn|Carneiro|1970|p=734}}

In addition to this, is what Carneiro calls the ''automatic hypothesis'', which contends that the development of agriculture easily produces conditions necessary for the development of a state. With surplus food stocks created by agricultural development, creation of distinct worker classes and a division of labor would automatically trigger creation of the state form.{{sfn|Carneiro|1970|p=733}}

A third voluntary hypothesis, particularly common with some explanations of early state development, is that long distance trade networks created an impetus for states to develop at key locations: such as ports or oases. For example, the increased trade in the 16th century may have been a key to state formation in West African states such as [[Kingdom of Whydah|Whydah]], [[Dahomey]], and the [[Benin Empire]].{{sfn|Service|1978|p=30}}

===Conflict theories===
Conflict theories of state formation regard conflict and dominance of some population over another population as key to the formation of states.{{sfn|Carneiro|1970|p=734}} In contrast with voluntary theories, these arguments believe that people do not voluntarily agree to create a state to maximize benefits, but that states form due to some form of oppression by one group over others. A number of different theories rely on conflict, dominance, or oppression as a causal process or as a necessary mechanism within certain conditions and they may borrow from other approaches. In general the theories highlight: ''economic stratification'', ''conquest of other peoples'', conflict in ''circumscribed areas'', and the neoevolutionary growth of bureaucracy. 
[[File:Panorama of Monte Alban from the South Platform.jpg|thumb|center|650px|Panorama of Monte Albán in present-day Mexico, seen from the South Platform. Archeologists oftentimes look for evidence of such "large-scale construction projects, trade networks, and religious systems" to identify early states.{{sfn|Haas|1981|p=82}}]]

:*'''''Economic stratification'''''
:: [[Friedrich Engels]] articulated one of the earliest theories of the state based on anthropological evidence in ''[[The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State]]'' (1884).{{sfn|Claessen|Skalnik|1978|p=6}} The theory of Engels developed from study of ''Ancient Society'' (1877) by [[Lewis H. Morgan]] and from the sketches of this work by [[Karl Marx]] on the [[Asiatic mode of production]].{{sfn|Service|1978|pp=25-26}} Engels argues that the state developed as a result of the need to protect private property. The theory contended that surplus production as a result of the development of agriculture created a division and specialization of labor: leading to classes who worked the land and to those who could devote time to other tasks. Class antagonism and the need to secure the private property of those living on the surplus production produced by agriculturalists resulted in the creation of the state.{{sfn|Claessen|Skalnik|1978|p=7}} The anthropologist [[Morton Fried]] (1923-1986) further developed this approach, positing social stratification as the primary dynamic underlying the development of the state.{{sfn|Service|1978|pp=28-29}}

:*'''''Conquest theories'''''
:: Similar to the economic stratification theories, the conquest theory contends that a single city establishes a state in order to control other tribes or settlements it has conquered. The theory has its roots in the work of [[Ibn Khaldun]] (1332-1406) and of [[Jean Bodin]] (1530–1596), but it was first organized around anthropological evidence by [[Franz Oppenheimer]] (1864-1943).{{sfn|Service|1978|p=24}}{{sfn|Gross|1999|p=5}} Oppenheimer argues that the state was created to cement inequality between peoples that resulted from conquest.{{sfn|Claessen|Skalnik|1978|p=10}}

:*'''''Carneiro's circumscription theory'''''
[[File:Macchupicchu.jpg|thumb|right|The mountain [[Huayna Picchu]] overlooks the ruins of [[Machu Picchu]]. The [[Andes]] mountains circumscribed much of the region.]] 
:{{main|Carneiro's circumscription theory}}
::[[Robert Carneiro]] developed a theory (1970){{sfn|Carneiro|1970}} aiming to provide a more nuanced understanding of state formation by accounting for the fact that many factors (surplus agriculture, warfare, irrigation, conquest, etc.) did not produce states in all situations. He concluded that while population pressure and warfare were mechanisms of state formation, they only created states in geographic regions circumscribed, or walled off from the surrounding area.{{sfn|Claessen|Skalnik|1978|p=13}} Geographic barriers (or in some cases barriers created by nomadic raiders or by rival societies) create limitations on the ability of the people to deal with production shortfalls, and the result is that warfare results in state creation.{{sfn|Service|1978|pp=28-29}} In situations of unlimited agricultural land (like the Amazon or the Eastern United States), Carneiro believes that the pressures did not exist and so warfare allowed people to move elsewhere and thus did not spur creation of a state.{{sfn|Carneiro|1970|pp=734-735}}

:*'''''Neoevolutionary theories'''''
:{{further|Neoevolutionism}}
::A number of different theories, sometimes connected with some of the processes above, explain state formation in terms of the [[Sociocultural evolution|evolution]] of [[leadership]] systems. This argument sees human society as evolving from [[tribe]]s or [[chiefdom]]s into states through a gradual process of transformation that lets a small group hierarchically structure society and maintain order through appropriation of [[symbol]]s of power.{{sfn|Blanton|Fargher|2008|p=8}} Groups that gained power in tribal society gradually worked towards building the hierarchy and segmentation that created the state.{{sfn|Blanton|Fargher|2008|p=9}}

::[[Elman Service]] (1915-1996) proposed that, unlike in economic stratification theories, the state largely creates stratification in society rather than being created to defend that stratification.{{sfn|Cohen|1978|p=38}} Bureaucracy evolves to support the leadership structure in tribes and uses religious hierarchy and economic stratification as a means to further increase its power.{{sfn|Haas|1982|p=73}} Warfare may play a key role in the situation, because it allows leaders to distribute benefits in ways that serve their interests, however it is a constant that feeds the system rather than an autonomous factor.{{sfn|Cohen|1978|p=51}} Similarly, anthropologist [[Henry T. Wright]] argues (2006) that competitive and conflictual environments produce political experimentation leading to the development of the state. As opposed to theories that the state develops through chance or tinkering, experimentation involves a more directed process where tribal leaders learn from organization forms of the past and from the outcomes they produced.{{sfn|Wright|2006|p=316}}

===Other theories===
Other aspects are highlighted in different theories as of contributing importance. It is sometimes claimed that technological development, religious development, or socialization of members are crucial to state development. However, most of these factors are found to be secondary in anthropological analysis.{{sfn|Cohen|1978|pp=61-68}} In addition to conquest, some theories contend that the need for defense from military conquest or the military organization to conquer other peoples is the key aspect leading to state formation.{{sfn|Service|1978|p=30}}

===Discredited theories===
Some theories proposed in the 19th century and early 20th century have since been largely discredited by anthropologists. Carneiro writes that theories "with a racial basis, for example, are now so thoroughly discredited that they need not be dealt with...We can also reject the belief that the state is an expression of the 'genius' of a people, or that it arose through a 'historical accident.' Such notions make the state appear to be something metaphysical or adventitious, and thus place it beyond scientific understanding."{{sfn|Carneiro|1970|p=733}} Similarly, [[Social Darwinism|social Darwinist]] perspectives like those of [[Walter Bagehot]] in ''Physics and Politics'' argued that the state form developed as a result of the best leaders and organized societies gradually gaining power until a state resulted. Such explanations are not considered sufficient to explain the formation of the state.{{sfn|Service|1978|p=24}}{{sfn|Cohen|1978|p=42}}

==Theories about modern state development==
In the [[Middle Ages|medieval period]] (500-1400) in Europe, there were a variety of authority forms throughout the region. These included feudal lords, empires, religious authorities, free cities, and other authorities.{{sfn|Barkey|Parikh|1991|p=527}} Often dated to the 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]], there began to be the development in Europe of modern states with large-scale capacity for taxation, coercive control of their populations, and advanced bureaucracies.{{sfn|Axtmann|2004|p=260}} The state became prominent in Europe over the next few centuries before the particular form of the state spread to the rest of the world via the colonial and international pressures of the 19th century and 20th century.{{sfn|Barkey|Parikh|1991|p=535}} Other modern states developed in Africa and Asia prior to colonialism, but were largely displaced by colonial rule.{{sfn|Krohn-Hansen|Nustad|2005|p=12}}

Political scientists, sociologists, and anthropologists began studying the state formation processes in Europe and elsewhere in the 17th century—beginning significantly with [[Max Weber]]. However, state formation became a primary interest in the 1970s. The question was often framed as a contest between state forces and society forces and the study of how the state became prominent over particular societies.{{sfn|Barkey|Parikh|1991|p=525}} A number of theories developed regarding state development in Europe. Other theories focused on the creation of states in late colonial and post-colonial societies.{{sfn|Barkey|Parikh|1991|p=530}}  The lessons from these studies of the formation of states in the modern period are often used in theories about [[State-building]]. Other theories contend that the state in Europe was constructed in connection with peoples from outside Europe and that focusing on state formation in Europe as a foundation for study silences the diverse history of state formation.{{sfn|Krohn-Hansen|Nustad|2005|p=8}}

Based on the model of European states, it has been commonly assumed that development is the natural path that states will eventually walk through. However, Herbst holds that in the case African states, as well as in developing countries of other regions, development need not be the natural step. States that struggle their consolidation could remain permanently weak.{{sfn|Herbst|1990}}

===Warfare theories===
[[File:Defenestration-prague-1618.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A woodcut of the [[Defenestrations of Prague]] in 1618—which began the [[Thirty Years' War]] and ended with the Peace of Westphalia that started the recognition of the modern state]]

Two related theories are based on military development and warfare, and the role that these forces played in state formation. [[Charles Tilly]] developed an argument that the state developed largely as a result of "state-makers" who sought to increase the taxes they could gain from the people under their control so they could continue fighting wars.{{sfn|Barkey|Parikh|1991|p=527}} According to Tilly, the state makes war and war makes states.{{sfn|Tilly|1985|p=170}} In the constant warfare of the centuries in Europe, coupled with expanded costs of war with mass armies and gunpowder, warlords had to find ways to finance war  and control territory more effectively. The modern state presented the opportunity for them to develop taxation structures, the coercive structure to implement that taxation, and finally the guarantee of protection from other states that could get much of the population to agree.{{sfn|Barkey|Parikh|1991|p=527-528}} Taxes and revenue raising have been repeatedly pointed out as a key aspect of state formation and the development of state capacity. Economist [[Nicholas Kaldor]] emphasized on the importance of revenue raising and warned about the dangers of the dependence on foreign aid.{{sfn|Kaldor|1963}} Tilly argues, state making is similar to organized crime because it is a "quintessential protection racket with the advantage of legitimacy."{{sfn|Tilly|1985|p=169}}

[[Michael Roberts (historian)|Michael Roberts]] and [[Geoffrey Parker (historian)|Geoffrey Parker]], in contrast, finds that the primary causal factor was not the "state-makers" themselves, but simply the military revolutions that allowed development of larger armies.{{sfn|Thompson|Rasler|1999|p=5}} The argument is that with the expanded state of warfare, the state became the only administrative unit that could endure in the constant warfare in the Europe of this period, because only it could develop large enough armies.{{sfn|Thompson|Rasler|1999|p=6}} 
This view—that the modern state replaced chaos and general violence with internal disciplinary structures—has been challenged as ethnocentric, and ignoring the violence of modern states.{{sfn|Krohn-Hansen|Nustad|2005|p=19}}

War has played a key role not only in the consolidation of European states but also of some third world states. According to Herbst, external security threats have had a fundamental role in the development of the [[South Korea]]n and [[Taiwan]]ese states.{{sfn|Herbst|1990}} A 2017 study which tests the predictions of warfare theories of Tilly and others found that the predictions do not match the empirical record.{{sfn|Abramson|2017}} The study found that median state size decreased from 1100 to 1800, and that the number of states increases rapidly between the twelfth and thirteen centuries and remained constant until 1800.{{sfn|Abramson|2017}}

===Commerce theories===
[[Stein Rokkan]] and others have argued that the modern territorial state developed in places that were peripheral to the commercial "city belt" ("a central regional band extending, roughly, in an arc from the Low Countries, through the Rhineland and into Northern Italy") that ran through Central Europe.{{sfn|Abramson|2017}} The existence of prosperous urban centers that relied on commerce in Central Europe prevented rulers from consolidaing their rule over others.{{sfn|Abramson|2017}} The elites in those urban centers could rely on their wealth and on collective security institutions (like the Hanseatic or Swabian league) with other urban centers to sustain their independence. A lower density of urban centers in England and France made it easier for rulers to establish rule over expansive territories.{{sfn|Abramson|2017}}

===Feudal crisis theories===
Another argument contends that the state developed out of economic and social crises that were prominent in late-medieval Europe. Religious wars between Catholics and Protestants, and the involvement of leaders in the domains of other leaders under religious reasons was the primary problem dealt with in the Peace of Westphalia.{{sfn|Axtmann|2004|p=260}} In addition, Marxist theory contends that the economic crisis of feudalism forced the aristocracy to adapt various centralized forms of organization so they could retain economic power, and this resulted in the formation of the modern state.{{sfn|Barkey|Parikh|1991|p=529}}

===Cultural theories===
Some scholarship, linked to wider debates in Anthropology, has increasingly emphasized the state as a primarily cultural artifact, and focuses on how symbolism plays a primary role in state formation.{{sfn|Krohn-Hansen|Nustad|2005|p=9}} Most explicitly, some studies emphasize how the creation of national identification and citizenship were crucial to state formation. The state then is not simply a military or economic authority, but also includes cultural components creating consent by people by giving them rights and shared belonging.{{sfn|Barkey|Parikh|1991|p=530}}

===Outside Europe===
While modern states existed without European influence around the world before colonialism,{{sfn|Ejogu|2011|p=595}} post-colonial state formation has received the most significant attention.{{sfn|Southall|1974|p=155}} While warfare is primary in theories about state formation in Europe, the development of the international norm of [[non-interventionism]] means that other processes of state formation have become prominent outside Europe (including colonial imposition, assimilation, borrowing, and some internal political processes.{{sfn|Barkey|Parikh|1991|p=531}}{{sfn|Southall|1974|p=155}} [[John W. Meyer|John W. Meyer's]] ''World Society Theory'' contends that the state form was exported from Europe, institutionalized in the United Nations, and gradually the modern nation-state became the basis for both those in power and those challenging power.{{sfn|Wimmer|Feinstein|2010|p=769}} In addition, because many of the early modern states like the United Kingdom and France had significant empires, their institutional templates became standard for application globally.{{sfn|Wimmer|Feinstein|2010|p=769}}

'''Study 329''' was a [[clinical trial]] conducted in North America from 1994 to 1998 to study the efficacy of [[paroxetine]], an [[SSRI]] [[anti-depressant]], in treating 12- to 18-year-olds diagnosed with [[major depressive disorder]]. Led by [[Martin Keller (psychiatrist)|Martin Keller]], then professor of psychiatry at [[Brown University]], and funded by the British pharmaceutical company [[Beecham Group|SmithKline Beecham]]—known since 2000 as [[GlaxoSmithKline]] (GSK)—the study compared paroxetine with [[imipramine]], a [[tricyclic antidepressant]], and [[placebo]] (an inert pill).&lt;ref name=Keller2001&gt;{{wikicite|ref=Keller2001|reference=[[Martin Keller (psychiatrist)|Keller, Martin B.]]; Ryan, Neal D.; Strober, Michael, et al.

The drug attracted sales of $11.7&amp;nbsp;billion in the United States alone from 1997 to 2006, including $2.12&amp;nbsp;billion in 2002, the year before it lost its [[Chemical patent|patent]].&lt;ref name=Bloomberg14Dec2009/&gt;

Published in July 2001 in the ''[[Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry]]'' (''JAACAP''), which listed Keller and 21 other researchers as co-authors, study 329 became controversial when it was discovered that the article had been [[Medical ghostwriter|ghostwritten]] by a PR firm hired by SmithKline Beecham; had made inappropriate claims about the drug's efficacy; and had downplayed safety concerns.&lt;ref name=McGoey2009&gt;{{wikicite|ref=McGoey2009|reference=McGoey, Linsey; Jackson, Emily (February 2009).

''[[New Scientist]]'' wrote in 2015: "You may never have heard of it, but Study 329 changed medicine."&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Clare (16 September 2015).

SmithKline Beecham acknowledged internally in 1998 that the study had failed to show efficacy for paroxetine in adolescent depression.{{efn|name=positionpiece|[[Beecham Group|SmithKline Beecham]] (October 1998): "Study 329 (conducted in the US) showed trends in efficacy in favour of Seroxat/Paxil across all indices of depression. However, the study failed to demonstrate a statistically significant difference from placebo on the primary efficacy measures."&lt;ref name=SKBpositionpaper/&gt;{{pb}}
[[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] to GlaxoSmithKline (21 October 2002): "We agree that&amp;nbsp;... the results from Studies 329, 377, and 701 failed to demonstrate the efficacy of Paxil in pediatric patients with MDD. Given the fact that negative trials are frequently seen, even for antidepressant drugs that we know are effective, we agree that it would not be useful to describe these negative trials in labeling."&lt;ref&gt;[http://dida.library.ucsf.edu/pdf/xqu38h10 Letter from FDA to GlaxoSmithKline], 21 October 2002, courtesy of the [[Drug Industry Documents Archive]], University of California, San Francisco.&lt;/ref&gt;{{pb}}
UK [[Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency]] report (6 March 2008): "The first trial conducted by SKB, trial number 329, failed to show that Seroxat was effective in treating major depressive disorder in children. A  second trial, number 377, was conducted and this also failed to show that Seroxat was effective. Both studies were completed towards the end of 1998. SKB made no amendment to the SPC on the basis of these data. An internal GSK management document (which subsequently came into the public domain) dated October 1998 says that 'it would be commercially unacceptable to include a statement that efficacy had not been demonstrated, as this would undermine the profile of paroxetine'. During 1999, 32,000 Seroxat prescriptions were issued to children in the UK."&lt;ref name=MHRA6March2008p2pa2&gt;{{wikicite|ref=MHRA6March2008a|reference=[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20141206221413/http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/groups/es-policy/documents/websiteresources/con014155.pdf "MHRA Investigation into GlaxoSmithKline/Seroxat"], [[Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency]], 6 March 2008(a), (pp.&amp;nbsp;1–13)}}, p.&amp;nbsp;2, para.&amp;nbsp;2.&lt;/ref&gt;}} In addition, more patients in the group taking paroxetine had experienced [[suicidal ideation|suicidal thinking]] and behaviour.{{efn|name=Kondroquote}} Although the ''JAACAP'' article included these negative results, it did not account for them in its conclusion; on the contrary, it concluded that paroxetine was "generally well tolerated and effective for major depression in adolescents".&lt;ref name=Keller2001p770/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kondro2004&gt;{{wikicite|ref=Kondro2004|reference=Kondro, Wayne; Sibbald, Barbara (2 March 2004).

In 2003 Britain's  [[Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency]] (MHRA) analysed study 329 and other GSK studies of paroxetine, concluding that, while there was no evidence of paroxetine's efficacy in children and adolescents, there was "robust evidence" of a causal link between the drug and suicidal behaviour.&lt;ref name=MHRA6March2008&gt;{{wikicite|ref=MHRA6March2008a|reference=[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20141206221413/http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/groups/es-policy/documents/websiteresources/con014155.pdf "MHRA Investigation into GlaxoSmithKline/Seroxat"], [[Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency]], 6 March 2008(a).}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|[[Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency]] (6 March 2008): "The significance of the data provided in the GSK briefing document was that they represented robust evidence from controlled studies of a causal association between an SSRI and suicidal behaviour. It had previously been argued by some manufacturers that a causal link could not be drawn between suicidality and SSRIs because no link was evident from (adult) clinical trial data. On examination of the full clinical trial data in children submitted by GSK urgently on 27 May 2003 in response to requests from the Agency, it became clear that the evidence base for the safety concern of an increased risk of suicidal behaviour was derived from pooled analysis of all the trials (a meta-analysis). It was only when the trials were analysed together that the safety issue became apparent. These trials had been conducted over a number of years and some had been published in part, however the publications gave an incomplete and partial picture of the full data. Importantly, the trials conducted in a range of conditions in children and adolescents failed to demonstrate that Seroxat was effective in the treatment of depressive illness."&lt;ref name=MHRA6March2008p5pa12/&gt;}} The following month the MHRA and US [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) advised doctors not to prescribe paroxetine to the under-18s.&lt;ref name=FDA19June2003&gt;[http://dida.library.ucsf.edu/pdf/oqu38h10 "FDA statement regarding the anti-depressant Paxil for pediatric population"], Food and Drug Administration, 19 June 2003, courtesy of the [[Drug Industry Documents Archive]], University of California, San Francisco.&lt;/ref&gt; The MHRA launched a criminal inquiry into GSK's conduct, but announced in 2008 that there would be no charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{wikicite|ref=MHRA6March2008b|reference=[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20141205150130/http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/groups/comms-po/documents/news/con014162.pdf "GSK investigation concludes"], Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, press release, 6 March 2008(b).}}{{pb}}

==Clinical trial==
===Overview===
[[File:Seroxat, 4 May 2009 (1).jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|alt=photograph|Over two million prescriptions for paroxetine were written for children or adolescents in the US in 2002.&lt;ref name=PeoplevGSKp2/&gt;]]
Funded by SmithKline Beecham, the acute phase of study 329 was an eight-week, [[Double blind|double-blind]], [[randomized clinical trial]] conducted in 12 university or hospital psychiatric departments in the United States and Canada between 1994 and 1997.&lt;ref name=Keller2001/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For university or hospital psychiatric departments, [http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20141205150130/http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/groups/es-policy/documents/websiteresources/con014158.pdf "Paroxetine (Seroxat) – Variation assessment report"], MHRA, 4 June 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;6.&lt;/ref&gt; The study compared paroxetine, a [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]] marketed as Paxil and Seroxat, with [[imipramine]], a [[tricyclic antidepressant]] marketed as Tofranil, in teenagers aged 12–18 with a diagnosis of [[major depressive disorder]] of at least eight weeks duration.&lt;ref name=Keller2001/&gt; [[Martin Keller (psychiatrist)|Martin Keller]], then professor of psychiatry at [[Brown University]], had proposed the trial to the company in 1992 as the largest study until then to examine the efficacy of SSRIs in children.&lt;ref name=Kondro2004/&gt;

After a screening phase from April 1994, 275 male and female patients were randomly assigned paroxetine, imipramine or [[placebo]] (an inert pill).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Keller2001|Keller 2001]], p.&amp;nbsp;763.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 275, 93 were given paroxetine, 95 imipramine and 89 placebo. The paroxetine group were given 20&amp;nbsp;mg daily for four weeks, rising to 30&amp;nbsp;mg at week five and 40&amp;nbsp;mg at week six if the clinician thought it appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Keller2001|Keller 2001]], p.&amp;nbsp;764.&lt;/ref&gt; The last study visit was in May 1997, and the blind was broken in October.&lt;ref name=Jureidinip74/&gt;

===Efficacy===
The trial's protocol had described two primary and six secondary outcomes by which it would measure efficacy.&lt;ref name=protocol&gt;[http://www.healthyskepticism.org/documents/Protocol329.pdf "Study drug: BRL29060/Paroxetine (Paxil)"], SmithKline Beecham, 20 August 1993, amended 24 March 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jureidinip74&gt;{{wikicite|ref=Jureidini2008|reference=Jureidini, Jon N.; [[Leemon McHenry|McHenry, Leemon B.]]; Mansfield, Peter R.

According to Melanie Newman, writing for the ''[[BMJ]]'', "[t]he drug only produced a positive result when four new secondary outcome measures, which were introduced following the initial data analysis, were used instead. Fifteen other new secondary outcome measures failed to throw up positive results."{{efn|name=Newmanefficacy|Melanie Newman, ''BMJ'', 2010: "Study 329's results showed that paroxetine was no more effective than the placebo according to measurements of eight outcomes specified by Martin Keller, professor of psychiatry at Brown University, when he first drew up the trial.{{pb}}

The drug also showed no significant effect for the initial six secondary outcome measures.{{pb}}

===Safety===
Eleven subjects on paroxetine, compared to five on imipramine and two on placebo, experienced [[serious adverse event]]s (SAE), including behavioral problems and [[Pseudobulbar affect|emotional lability]]. The researchers defined an event as an SAE if it resulted in hospitalization, involved suicidal gestures, or was regarded as serious by the subject's doctor. In the 93 taking paroxetine, the SAEs consisted of one subject experiencing headache while tapering off, and 10 experiencing psychiatric problems. Seven of the 10 were hospitalized. Two of the 10 experienced worsening depression; two conduct problems such as aggression; one [[euphoria]]; and five emotional lability, including suicidal ideation and behaviour. Of the 95 patients on imipramine and the 89 on placebo, one in each group experienced emotional lability. Yet Keller's article in the ''[[Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry]]'' concluded that, of the 11 patients who had experienced SAEs while taking paroxetine, "only headache (1 patient) was considered by the treating investigator to be related to paroxetine treatment".&lt;ref name=Kellerp769&gt;[[#Keller2001|Keller 2001]], p.&amp;nbsp;769.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|name=Kondroquote|Wayne Kondro and Barbara Sibbald (''[[Canadian Medical Association Journal]]'', 2004): "Study 329 was eventually published (''J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry'' 2001;40[7]:762-72) in 2001. The authors concluded that paroxetine is 'generally well tolerated and effective for major depression in adolescents.' Among the 93 adolescents taking Seroxat, there were 5 serious cases of 'emotional lability' (e.g., suicidal ideation/gestures). Among the 95 patients taking the comparison treatment, imipramine (Tofranil), there was 1 such case, and among the 89 subjects receiving placebo there was also 1. According to the article, only 1 serious adverse event—headache in 1 patient—was considered by the treating investigator to be related to paroxetine treatment."&lt;ref name=Kondro2004/&gt;}}

In October 1998 the neurosciences division of SmithKline Beecham's Central Medical Affairs (CMAT) department distributed a position paper, "Seroxat/Paxil Adolescent Depression: Position piece on the phase III clinical studies", that discussed studies 329 and 377.&lt;ref name=SKBpositionpaper&gt;[http://dida.library.ucsf.edu/pdf/vsu38h10 "Seroxat/Paxil Adolescent Depression: Position piece on the phase III clinical studies"], SmithKline Beecham, October 1998, courtesy of the [[Drug Industry Documents Archive]], University of California, San Francisco; also available [http://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/opa/legacy/2012/07/02/complaint-ex1.pdf here], courtesy of the [[United States Department of Justice]].&lt;/ref&gt; The latter was a 12-week trial, comparing paroxetine and placebo in teenagers, conducted from 1995 to 1998.{{efn|Study 377 was conducted in 33 centres in Europe (Belgium, Netherlands, Italy, Spain, UK), Canada, South America (Argentina and Mexico), South Africa and the United Arab Emirates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20141205150130/http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/groups/es-policy/documents/websiteresources/con014158.pdf "Paroxetine (Seroxat) – Variation assessment report"], MHRA, 4 June 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;8.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The SmithKline Beecham position paper explained that the company had decided not to submit trial data from studies 329 and 377 to regulators, and discussed how to "effectively manage the dissemination of these data in order to minimise any potential negative commercial impact".&lt;ref name=Kondro2004/&gt; An attached memo noted that the results were disappointing and would not support a label claim that paroxetine could be used to treat adolescents: "The best that could have been achieved was a statement that, although safety data was reassuring, efficacy had not been demonstrated."&lt;ref&gt;Jackie Westaway, SmithKline Beecham (14 October 1998) [http://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/opa/legacy/2012/07/02/complaint-ex1.pdf Memo], courtesy of the [[United States Department of Justice]].&lt;/ref&gt; The paper said: "it would be commercially unacceptable to include a statement that efficacy had not been demonstrated, as this would undermine the profile of paroxetine."&lt;ref name="SKBpositionpaper"/&gt;

Study 329 had shown "trends in efficacy in favour of Seroxat/Paxil across all indices of depression&amp;nbsp;...", according to the paper, "[but had] failed to demonstrate a statistically significant difference from placebo on the primary efficacy measures". Study 377 had shown a high placebo response rate and had "failed [to] demonstrate any separation of Seroxat/Paxil from placebo". SmithKline Beecham decided to publish study 329 but not 377, and not to submit either trial to the regulators, because they were "insufficiently robust to support a label change" for adolescent use".&lt;ref name=SKBpositionpaper/&gt;

The document was leaked during a lawsuit and first published by the ''[[Canadian Medical Association Journal]]'' in March 2004. In response a GSK spokesperson said that "the memo draws an inappropriate conclusion and is not consistent with the facts&amp;nbsp;... GSK abided by all regulatory requirements for submitting safety data. We also communicated safety and efficacy data to physicians through posters, abstracts, and other publications."&lt;ref name=Kondro2004/&gt;

==''JAACAP'' article==
===Authorship===
Although the ''JAACAP'' article listed its authors as Martin Keller and 21 other physicians or researchers, the article had in fact been written by Scientific Therapeutics Information (STI), a PR company in Springfield, New Jersey, specializing in communications for the pharmaceutical industry.&lt;ref name=Laden3April1998/&gt; The ''JAACAP'' article did not mention STI; the only mention of Laden was: "Editorial assistance was provided by Sally K. Laden, M.S." The list of authors included James P. McCafferty of GSK, but the article did not disclose his company affiliation.&lt;ref name=Keller2001/&gt;

STI had worked with SmithKline Beecham on its promotion of paroxetine since the early 1990s.{{efn|In 1993, for example, STI sent a proposal to GSK for a meeting between its psychiatrist advisory board and Paxil advisory board in the Ritz Carlton Hotel in Palm Beach, Florida.&lt;ref&gt;Romankiewicz, John A. (1 October 1993). [http://pogoarchives.org/m/ph/gw/gw-attachment-a.pdf "Paxil Advisory Board Meeting"], Scientific Therapeutics Information.&lt;/ref&gt;}} In April 1998 Sally K. Laden and John A. Romankiewicz of STI sent SmithKline Beecham an estimate of $17,250 to work on six drafts of the study 329 paper, including the final draft, to cover the period up to March 1999. The sum was payable in installments: $8,500 upon initiation, $5,125 after draft three, and $3,625 upon submission to the journal.&lt;ref name=Laden3April1998&gt;{{wikicite|ref=Laden3April1998|reference=Laden, Sally K.; Romankiewicz, John A.

The estimate covered all writing, editing, library research, copy editing, art work and coordination with the physicians and others who would be named as authors. Martin Keller would be listed as the main author.&lt;ref name=Laden3April1998/&gt; The first draft was ready by December 1998.&lt;ref name=Laden18Dec1998&gt;{{wikicite|ref=Laden18Dec1998|reference=Laden, Sally K.

===Publication===
STI first submitted the article to the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' (''JAMA''), which rejected it in November 1999. Concerns cited by ''JAMA'' reviewers included that "the main finding of the study is the high placebo response rate". They also suggested that the named authors confirm they had been "granted full access to the data set to verify the accuracy of the report".&lt;ref name="Newman2010p1247"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{wikicite|ref=Laden7Dec1998|reference=Laden, Sally K.

Early drafts of the paper for ''JAMA'' did not mention the [[serious adverse event]]s (SAEs). A SmithKline Beecham scientist, James McCafferty, added a paragraph about these in July 1999, adding that 11 patients on paroxetine had experienced SAEs, against two on placebo: "worsening depression, emotional lability, headache, and hostility were considered related or possibly related to treatment."&lt;ref name=Jureidini2008p77&gt;[[#Jureidini2008|Jureidini et al. 2008]], p.&amp;nbsp;77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Laden21July1999&gt;{{wikicite|ref=Laden21July1999|reference=McCafferty, James P.

[http://dida.library.ucsf.edu/pdf/ssu38h10 James McCafferty, SmithKline Beecham, to Sally Laden, STI], courtesy of the [[Drug Industry Documents Archive]], University of California, San Francisco.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was changed in the final draft to: "Of the 11 patients, only headache (1 patient) was considered by the treating investigator to be related to paroxetine treatment."&lt;ref name=Jureidini2008p77/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kellerp769/&gt;

In December 1999 Laden submitted the rewritten paper to ''JAACAP'', led at the time by Mina K. Dulcan, editor-in-chief. According to Melanie Newman in the ''BMJ'', ''JAACAP's'' reviewers wrote that the results did not "clearly demonstrate efficacy for paroxetine", and asked whether, because of the high placebo response rate, SSRIs should be regarded as first-line therapy.&lt;ref name=Newman2008Laden&gt;[[#Newman2010|Newman 2010]], p.&amp;nbsp;1247.{{pb}}{{wikicite|ref=Laden24Aug2000|reference=Laden, Sally K.

[http://dida.library.ucsf.edu/pdf/cvu38h10 Sally Laden–Michael Strober–Boris Birmaher correspondence], courtesy of the [[Drug Industry Documents Archive]], University of California, San Francisco.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''JAACAP'' accepted the article in January 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{wikicite|ref=Laden11Jan2001|reference=Laden, Sally K.

[http://dida.library.ucsf.edu/pdf/buu38h10 Sally Laden to the Paxil Team], courtesy of the [[Drug Industry Documents Archive]], University of California, San Francisco.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and published it in July.&lt;ref name=Keller2001/&gt;

The article concluded: "Paroxetine is generally well tolerated and effective for major depression in adolescents."&lt;ref name=Keller2001p770/&gt; McCafferty's paragraph about worsening depression and emotional lability possibly being related to the treatment had been removed. The only SAE attributed to paroxetine in the ''JAACAP'' article was in one patient who had reported headache.&lt;ref name=Kellerp769/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jureidini2008p77/&gt; The article continued: "Because these serious adverse events were judged by the investigator to be related to treatment in only 4 patients (paroxetine, 1; imipramine, 2; placebo, 1), causality cannot be determined conclusively." It concluded: "The findings of this study provide evidence of the efficacy and safety of the SSRI, paroxetine, in the treatment of adolescent depression."&lt;ref name=Keller2001p770&gt;[[#Keller2001|Keller 2001]], pp.&amp;nbsp;770–771.&lt;/ref&gt;

==2001 GlaxoSmithKline sales memo, off-label use==
GSK used the ''JAACAP'' article to promote paroxetine to doctors for use in their teenage patients. The drug had not been approved for use in children and adolescents. Drug companies are prohibited from promoting drugs for unapproved uses, but doctors are permitted to prescribe drugs for what is known as [[off-label use]]. In the UK 32,000 prescriptions of paroxetine were written for children and adolescents in 1999,&lt;ref&gt;[[#MHRA6March2008a|MHRA, 6 March 2008(a)]], p.&amp;nbsp;2, para.&amp;nbsp;3.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the US that figure rose to 2.1 million in 2002, earning GSK $55&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=PeoplevGSKp2&gt;[http://news.findlaw.com/cnn/docs/glaxo/nyagglaxo60204cmp.pdf ''The People of the State of New York against GlaxoSmithKline''], 2 June 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;2, para.&amp;nbsp;3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Doshi16Sept2015/&gt;

On 7 August 2001 Sally Laden of STI, apparently the main author of the ''JAACAP'' article, arranged for GSK to buy 500 reprints of the article—300 for Keller and 200 for Zachary Hawkins of GSK's Paxil Product Management team—to be distributed to the company's neuroscience sales force.&lt;ref&gt;{{wikicite|ref=Bass2008|reference=[[Alison Bass|Bass, Alison]] (2008).

Laden, Sally (27 April 2001). [http://dida.library.ucsf.edu/pdf/dwu38h10 SmithKline Beecham to Sally Laden], courtesy of the [[Drug Industry Documents Archive]], University of California, San Francisco.&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 August 2001 Zachary Hawkins sent a memo about study 329 to "All Sales Representatives Selling ''Paxil''", calling study 329 a "cutting-edge,' landmark study", the first to compare efficacy of a [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]] and a [[tricyclic antidepressant]] with placebo in the treatment of depressed adolescents. "''Paxil'' demonstrates REMARKABLE Efficacy and Safety in the treatment of adolescent depression," he wrote.&lt;ref name=Hawkins18Aug2001&gt;{{wikicite|ref=Hawkins2001|reference=Hawkins, Zachary (18 August 2001).

The memo continued that paroxetine was "significantly more effective than placebo" on certain outcomes: "''Paxil'' was generally well tolerated in this adolescent population and most adverse events were not serious. The most common adverse events occurred at rates that were similar to rates in the placebo group." It ended with:

&lt;blockquote style="margin-right:8em; margin-left:0; border-left:solid 2.5px #ccc; padding:1.5em;"&gt;
In conclusion, the findings of this study provide evidence of the efficacy and safety of ''Paxil'' in the treatment of adolescent depression. Here's another example of GlaxoSmithKline's commitment to Psychiatry by bringing forth 'cutting edge' scientific data. ''Paxil'' is truly a REMARKABLE product that continues to demonstrate efficacy, even in this understudied population."&lt;ref name=Hawkins18Aug2001/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===BBC ''Panorama'', MHRA===
Scottish reporter Shelley Jofre presented four investigative programmes on paroxetine for BBC ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' between 2002 and 2007, including one devoted to study 329, "Secrets of the Drug Trials", in January 2007.&lt;ref name=Panorama2002&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/panorama/2310197.stm "The Secrets of Seroxat"], BBC ''Panorama'', 13 October 2002 ([http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/programmes/panorama/transcripts/seroxat.txt transcript]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Panorama2003&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/panorama/2982797.stm "Emails from the edge"], BBC ''Panorama'', 11 May 2003 ([http://news.bbc.co.uk/nol/shared/spl/hi/programmes/panorama/transcripts/emailsfromtheedge.txt transcript]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Panorama2004&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/panorama/3677792.stm "Taken on Trust"], BBC ''Panorama'', 3 October 2004 ([http://news.bbc.co.uk/nol/shared/spl/hi/programmes/panorama/transcripts/takenontrust.txt transcript]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Panorama2007&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/panorama/6291773.stm "Secrets of the drugs trials"], BBC ''Panorama'', 29 January 2007 ([http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/panorama/6317137.stm transcript]).{{pb}}

Jofre's interest in paroxetine was triggered by the July 2001 case of ''Timothy J. Tobin v. SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals'' in the United States. The family of 60-year-old Donald Schell sued the company after Schell shot and killed his wife, daughter and baby granddaughter, then committed suicide, 48 hours after starting a course of paroxetine in 1998. A Wyoming jury awarded the plaintiffs $6.4 million.&lt;ref&gt;Hilts, Philip J. (8 June 2001).

[https://www.theguardian.com/education/2001/aug/09/medicalscience.healthandwellbeing "'Four people dead is four too many'"], ''The Guardian''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first of Jofre's programmes, "The Secrets of Seroxat", aired on 13 October 2002, and covered the Schell case, study 329, and GSK's efforts to market the drug for use in children. (At the time the [[Summary of Product Characteristics]] for paroxetine in Europe said that its use in children was "not recommended as safety and efficacy have not been established in this population".)&lt;ref&gt;[[#MHRA6March2008a|MHRA, 6 March 2008(a)]], p.&amp;nbsp;2, para.&amp;nbsp;2.&lt;/ref&gt; Discussing study 329 and the paediatric use of paroxetine, Alistair Benbow, head of European psychiatry for GlaxoSmithKline, told Jofre that, during study 329, paroxetine had been "generally well tolerated by this difficult to treat population".{{efn|NICK ALCOCK, pharmaceutical company analyst ("The Secrets of Seroxat", BBC ''Panorama'', 13 October 2002): "In the United States, if a company such as GlaxoSmithKline can gain an additional licence for the treatment of children, it means that they get a six month extension to their overall patent."{{pb}}
JOFRE: "And is that worth a lot of money?"{{pb}}
ALCOCK: "For Paxil it's worth&amp;nbsp;... six month's worth of sales is around a billion dollars, so yes."{{pb}}
JOFRE: "That billion dollar windfall now looks tantalisingly close, thanks to a recent study co-written by American child psychiatrist Neal Ryan. It was the biggest ever trial of Seroxat in children funded by Glaxo SmithKline.  The depressed children who took Seroxat did better than those who took an older drug, or were just given sugar pills. That's the good news. The bad news is that ten of the ninety-three children on Seroxat suffered serious psychiatric problems within weeks of going on the drug. Most of them had to be hospitalised. There were five children out of ninety-three children on Seroxat who had suicidal thoughts and gestures.  Another five out of that ninety-three had serious psychiatric side effects. Don't you think parents would be worried about that if their child was to be given this drug?"{{pb}}
Dr ALASTAIR BENBOW, Head of European Clinical Psychiatry, GlaxoSmithKline: "I think what parents would be more worried about is the risk that their children have of committing suicide and other symptoms of severe depression if no treatment was available.  I think parents would want treatments to be properly evaluated during clinical trials before their children are given any medicine."{{pb}}
JOFRE: "But the evidence here suggest that their children might be at more risk of suicide if they go on Seroxat."
{{pb}}BENBOW: "No, the evidence is not there, there is no statistical difference between the groups. The reality of the situation is that in this trial, Seroxat was generally well tolerated by this difficult to treat population."&lt;ref name=Panorama2002/&gt;}}

[[File:Seroxat, 4 May 2009 (2).jpg|thumb|left|upright=1|alt=photograph|Paroxetine is sold in the UK as Seroxat.&lt;ref name=MHRA6March2008p4pa11/&gt;]]
To examine the issues the ''Panorama'' had raised, Britain's [[Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency]] (MHRA) set up an ad hoc group of experts, which held a meeting with GSK on 14 November 2002. The MHRA asked GSK about its clinical trials in children. GSK was planning to apply for pediatric indications for paroxetine. According to the MHRA, "GSK did not raise any concern about lack of efficacy or adverse reactions in the clinical trials in the paediatric population at that meeting."&lt;ref name=MHRA6March2008p3pa7&gt;[[#MHRA6March2008a|MHRA, 6 March 2008(a)]], p.&amp;nbsp;3, para.&amp;nbsp;7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jofre's second ''Panorama'' programme on paroxetine, "Emails from the edge" (11 May 2003) focused on the 67,000 calls and 1,400 e-mails the BBC received, after the first programme, from people taking the drug.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/panorama/3005483.stm "Seroxat: Emails from the edge"], BBC News, undated.&lt;/ref&gt; They reported withdrawal symptoms, as well as acts of violence and self-harm that they believed were attributable to paroxetine. During this programme, Benbow told Jofre: "We have been asked by the regulatory authorities to provide all our information related to suicides and I can tell you the data that we provide to them clearly shows no link between Seroxat and an increased risk of suicide—no link."&lt;ref name=Panorama2003/&gt;

===May 2003 GlaxoSmithKline briefing paper===
In February 2003 the MHRA's [[Committee on the Safety of Medicines]] (CSM) set up an Expert Working Group to investigate SSRIs and safety.&lt;ref&gt;[[#MHRA6March2008a|MHRA, 6 March 2008(a)]], p.&amp;nbsp;4, para.&amp;nbsp;8.&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for its first meeting, the MHRA met GSK on 21 May 2003 to make sure that GSK had supplied all information relevant to paroxetine and safety, and to discuss Jofre's second ''Panorama'' programme.&lt;ref name=MHRA6March2008p4pa11/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{wikicite|ref=MHRA4June2003|reference=[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20141205150130/http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/groups/es-policy/documents/websiteresources/con014158.pdf "Paroxetine (Seroxat)—Variation Assessment Report—Proposal to contraindicate in adolescents and children under 18 years with major depressive disorder"], Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, 4 June 2003, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–18 (hereinafter MHRA, 4 June 2003)}}, p.&amp;nbsp;5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The briefing paper concluded that "analysis of the safety data demonstrates that paroxetine is generally well tolerated by paediatric patients&amp;nbsp;...," but suggested a label change to the effect that efficacy had not been established in children with major depressive disorder, and that adverse reactions could include [[hyperkinesia]], hostility, emotional lability and agitation. The paper said these had occurred around twice as much in the paroxetine group than in those taking placebo.&lt;ref name=MHRA22May2003p32/&gt;

By "emotional lability", the paper alluded in particular to suicidal thoughts and behaviour. Of 20 reports of adverse events in the paroxetine groups, 12 had been suidical thoughts or suicide attempts (none successful), three self-mutilation and five general emotional lability. There had been eight adverse events in the patients taking placebo, of which four were suicidal thoughts or behaviour, one self-mutilation and three emotional lability.&lt;ref&gt;[[#MHRA22May2003|MHRA, 22 May 2003]], section 5.2.5.3, p.&amp;nbsp;29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The paper suggested a label change regarding withdrawal symptoms, which it said had occurred with paroxetine at roughly twice the rate of placebo.&lt;ref name=MHRA22May2003p32&gt;[[#MHRA22May2003|MHRA, 22 May 2003]]. For twice that of placebo, section 5.2.5, p.&amp;nbsp;27. For the rest, section 5.4, p.&amp;nbsp;32.&lt;/ref&gt;

===MHRA response===
[[Alasdair Breckenridge]], then-chair of the MHRA, told ''Panorama'' that the GSK briefing document caused "a very dramatic change in our thinking about Seroxat and children".&lt;ref&gt;Joffre, Shelley (3 October 2004). "Taken on Trust", BBC ''Panorama''.&lt;/ref&gt; The MHRA asked GSK to submit the full clinical data, which they did on 27 May 2003. The data provided "robust evidence" of a causal link between paroxetine and suicidality, and no evidence that paroxetine was effective in treating depression in children.&lt;ref name=MHRA6March2008p5pa12&gt;[[#MHRA6March2008a|MHRA, 6 March 2008(a)]], p.&amp;nbsp;5, para.&amp;nbsp;12.&lt;/ref&gt; The MHRA wrote:

&lt;blockquote style="margin-right:8em; margin-left:0; border-left:solid 2.5px #ccc; padding:1.5em;"&gt;
On examination of the full clinical trial data in children submitted by GSK urgently on 27 May 2003 in response to requests from the Agency, it became clear that the evidence base for the safety concern of an increased risk of suicidal behaviour was derived from pooled analysis of all the trials (a meta-analysis). It was only when the trials were analysed together that the safety issue became apparent. These trials had been conducted over a number of years and some had been published in part, however the publications gave an incomplete and partial picture of the full data. Importantly, the trials conducted in a range of conditions in children and adolescents failed to demonstrate that Seroxat was effective in the treatment of depressive illness.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The analysis suggested an increased rate of suicidal thinking and behaviour of 3.4 percent on paroxetine versus 1.2 percent on placebo.&lt;ref name=CarreyNov2003&gt;Carrey, Normand; Pharm, Adil Virani (November 2003).

===Criminal inquiry===
[[File:Buckingham Palace Road - geograph.org.uk - 2321147.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|right|The MHRA offices on [[Buckingham Palace Road]], London. The MHRA announced in 2008 that GSK would not be prosecuted.]]
The MHRA launched a criminal inquiry in October 2003 into GSK's conduct. This was based on two concerns: (a) the length of time between the end of the trials and GSK's passing the safety concerns to the MHRA; and (b) the manner in which the material had been handed over. Rather than alerting the MHRA of a risk, GSK had supplied the data in relation to an application to extend the indications of paroxetine to children. The MHRA deemed this inappropriate for an urgent safety concern because of the length of time such applications can take.&lt;ref&gt;[[#MHRA6March2008a|MHRA, 6 March 2008(a)]], pp.&amp;nbsp;5–6, para.&amp;nbsp;16–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Medical ethicists Linsey Goey and Emily Jackson argued that the [[#1998 SmithKline Beecham position paper|1998 SmithKline Beecham position paper]], in which the company said it had decided not to show studies 329 and 377 to regulators,&lt;ref name=SKBpositionpaper/&gt; represented a ''prima facie'' breach of the ''[[Medicines Act 1968]]'' and ''Medicines for Human Use Regulations'', which required pharmaceutical companies to pass to the regulator trial data that had safety and efficacy implications.&lt;ref&gt;[[#McGoey2009|McGoey and Jackson 2009]], p.&amp;nbsp;108.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jackson2012p109&gt;[[#Jackson2012|Jackson 2012]], p.&amp;nbsp;109.&lt;/ref&gt;

The MHRA reviewed around one million pages of documentation in the course of the inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;[[#MHRA6March2008a|MHRA, 6 March 2008(a)]], p.&amp;nbsp;7, para.&amp;nbsp;21.&lt;/ref&gt; After a four-year investigation, independent counsel instructed by the MHRA advised, according to an MHRA report, that "no offence ha[d] been  committed contrary to the 1994 Regulations [''Medicines for Human Use (Marketing Authorisations Etc.) Regulations 1994'']", because GSK's clinical trials and alleged failure to provide data from them "most likely did not fall within the regime implemented by those Regulations".&lt;ref&gt;[[#MHRA6March2008a|MHRA, 6 March 2008(a)]], p.&amp;nbsp;8, para.&amp;nbsp;28; p. 9, para 35.&lt;/ref&gt; If the 1994 Regulations did apply, the report said, the "relevant provisions were not sufficiently clear so as to permit a criminal sanction for their breach".&lt;ref&gt;[[#MHRA6March2008a|MHRA, 6 March 2008(a)]], p.&amp;nbsp;9, para.&amp;nbsp;36.&lt;/ref&gt; The MHRA announced in March 2008 that there would be no prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;[[#MHRA6March2008a|MHRA, 6 March 2008(a)]], p.&amp;nbsp;9, para.&amp;nbsp;38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jackson2012p109/&gt; In October 2008 the 1994 Regulations were amended to prevent a repetition of the case.&lt;ref&gt;[[#McGoey2009|McGoey and Jackson 2009]], p.&amp;nbsp;107.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inquiries in the United States==
===''The Boston Globe''===
In November 1995 [[Alison Bass]] of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' began investigating [[Brown University]]'s psychiatry department, chaired by [[Martin Keller (psychiatrist)|Martin Keller]], who led Study 329. There were allegations that the department had taken $218,000 of government funds for research that apparently had not been conducted.&lt;ref&gt;Bass, Alison; Howe, Peter J. (29 March 1996). "Probe of Brown mental health contract handed over to AG"], ''The Boston Globe''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bass2008|Bass 2008]], p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1999 she reported Keller's financial relationship with the pharmaceutical industry, which included receipt of $500,000 in consulting fees the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;Bass, Alison (4 October 1999).

===FDA-mandated review===
In March 2004 the FDA mandated that drug companies review the use of their SSRIs in children. In 2006 GSK researchers published a review of five of their trials involving paroxetine and adolescents or children, including study 329 and the unpublished study 377. They wrote that suicidal ideation or behaviour had occurred in 22 of 642 patients on paroxetine (3.4 percent) against five of 549 on placebo (0.9 percent). The article concluded: "Adolescents treated with paroxetine showed an increased risk of suicide-related events.&amp;nbsp;... The presence of uncontrolled suicide risk factors, the relatively low incidence of these events, and their predominance in adolescents with MDD make it difficult to identify a single cause for suicidality in these pediatric patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{wikicite|ref=Apter2006|reference=Apter, Alan, et al.

===''People v. GlaxoSmithKline''===
[[File:Eliot Spitzer.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=photograph|[[Eliot Spitzer]]]]

In June 2004 New York State Attorney [[Eliot Spitzer]] filed a lawsuit against GSK in the [[New York State Supreme Court]] for having withheld clinical trial data about paroxetine, including from study 329.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.findlaw.com/cnn/docs/glaxo/nyagglaxo60204cmp.pdf ''The People of the State of New York against GlaxoSmithKline''], 2 June 2004, courtesy of [[FindLaw]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{wikicite|ref=Kagle|reference=Kagle, Abigail (undated).

GSK settled the case in August 2004, agreeing to pay $2.5&amp;nbsp;million, make its trial data about paroxetine and children available on its website, and establish a clinical trial register that would host summaries of all company-sponsored trials going back to 27 December 2000.

===Other lawsuits===
By 2009 GSK had paid almost $1&amp;nbsp;billion to settle paroxetine-related lawsuits related to 450 suicides, withholding data, as well as addiction, antitrust and other claims.

===''United States v. GlaxoSmithKline''===
{{further|GlaxoSmithKline#2012 criminal and civil settlement}}
In October 2011 the [[United States Department of Justice]] filed a lawsuit under the [[False Claims Act]] accusing GSK of promoting drugs for unapproved uses, failing to report safety data, reporting false prices to [[Medicaid]], and paying kickbacks to physicians in the form of gifts, trips and sham consultancy fees. The complaint included preparing the ''JAACAP'' article about study 329, exaggerating paroxetine's efficacy while downplaying the risks, and using the article to promote the drug for adolescent use, which was not approved by the FDA.&lt;ref name=DOJ2012/&gt;

GSK pleaded guilty in 2012 and paid a $3&amp;nbsp;billion settlement, including a criminal fine of $1&amp;nbsp;billion. The fine included an amount for "preparing, publishing and distributing a misleading medical journal article that misreported that a clinical trial of Paxil demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of depression in patients under age 18, when the study failed to demonstrate efficacy".&lt;ref name=DOJ2012&gt;[http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2012/July/12-civ-842.html "GlaxoSmithKline to Plead Guilty and Pay $3 Billion to Resolve Fraud Allegations and Failure to Report Safety Data"], United States Department of Justice, 2 July 2012.{{pb}}

Child psychiatrist Jon Jureidini of the [[Women's and Children's Hospital]] in Adelaide and Ann Tonkin of the [[University of Adelaide]] asked ''JAACAP'' in 2003 to retract the study 329 paper.&lt;ref name=JureidiniMay2003&gt;Jureidini, Jon; Tonkin, Ann (May 2003).

In 2005 the philosopher [[Leemon McHenry]] complained to ''JAACAP's'' editor, Mina Dulcan, that Keller and some of the other researchers named as authors had worked for GSK but had not declared their [[conflict of interest]] and had violated the journal's policy regarding authorship.&lt;ref name=Newman2010p1247/&gt; Keller had acted as a consultant for several drug companies.

Nardo, [[David Healy (psychiatrist)|David Healy]], Jon Jureidini, Melissa Raven, Catalin Tufanaru, and Elia Abi-Jaoude—published their re-analysis in the ''BMJ'' in September 2015. They concluded that "[t]he efficacy of paroxetine and imipramine was not statistically or clinically significantly different from placebo for any prespecified primary or secondary efficacy outcome," and that there were "clinically significant increases in&amp;nbsp;... suicidal ideation and behaviour and other serious adverse events in the paroxetine group and cardiovascular problems in the imipramine group."&lt;ref name=Noury16September2015/&gt;

A '''swell''', in the context of an [[ocean]], [[sea]] or [[lake]], is a series of [[mechanical waves]] that propagate along the interface between water and air and thus are often referred to as [[Gravity wave|surface gravity waves]]. These series of surface gravity waves are not [[wind waves]], which are generated by the immediate local [[wind]], but instead are generated by distant [[Low-pressure area|weather systems]], where wind blows for a duration of time over a [[Fetch (geography)|fetch]] of water. More generally, a swell consists of wind-generated waves that are not—or are hardly—affected by the local wind at that time. Swell waves often have a long [[wavelength]], but this varies due to the size,  strength and duration of the weather system responsible for the swell and the size of the water body. Swell wavelength also varies from event to event. Occasionally, swells which are longer than 700&amp;nbsp;m occur as a result of the most severe storms. Swells have a narrower range of [[frequency|frequencies]] and directions than locally generated wind waves, because swell waves have dispersed from their generation area, have [[Wind-wave dissipation|dissipated]] and therefore lost an amount of randomness, taking on a more defined shape and direction. Swell direction is the direction from which the swell is coming. It is measured in degrees (as on a compass), and often referred to in general directions, such as a NNW or SW swell.

==Formation==
Large breakers observed on a beach may result from distant weather systems over a fetch of ocean. Five factors influence the formation of wind waves&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Wind generated ocean waves | first=I. R. | last=Young | publisher=Elsevier | year=1999 | isbn=0-08-043317-0 }} p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; which will go on to become ocean swell:
* [[Wind speed]] or strength relative to wave speed — the wind must be moving faster than the wave crest for energy transfer; stronger prolonged winds create larger waves
* The uninterrupted distance of open water over which the wind blows without significant change in direction (called the ''[[fetch (geography)|fetch]]'')
* Width of area affected by fetch
* Wind duration — the time over which the wind has blown over a given area
* Water depth

All of these factors work together to determine the size of wind waves:

* [[Wave height]] (from [[trough (physics)|trough]] to [[crest (physics)|crest]])
* [[Wave length]] (from crest to crest)
* [[Wave period]] (time interval between arrival of consecutive crests at a stationary point)
* [[Wave propagation]] direction

[[File:Deep water wave.gif|thumb|Effects of deep water wave on movement of water particles ([[Stokes drift]]).]]A fully developed sea has the maximum wave size theoretically possible for a wind of a specific strength, duration, and fetch. Further exposure to that specific wind could only cause a loss of energy due to the breaking of wave tops and formation of "whitecaps".  Waves in a given area typically have a range of heights.  For weather reporting and for scientific analysis of wind wave statistics, their characteristic height over a period of time is usually expressed as ''[[significant wave height]]''. This figure represents an average height of the highest one-third of the waves in a given time period (usually chosen somewhere in the range from 20 minutes to twelve hours), or in a specific wave or storm system. The significant wave height is also the value a "trained observer" (e.g. from a ship's crew) would estimate from visual observation of a sea state. Given the variability of wave height, the largest individual waves are likely to be somewhat less than twice the reported significant wave height for a particular day or storm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Springer | isbn = 978-3-540-25316-7 | last1 = Weisse | first1 = Ralf | first2 = Hans | last2 = von Storch | title = Marine climate change: Ocean waves, storms and surges in the perspective of climate change | year = 2009 | page = 51 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sources of wind wave generation===
Wind waves are generated by many kinds of disturbances such as [[Seismic wave|seismic]] events, gravity, and crossing wind. The generation of wind waves is initiated by the disturbances of cross wind field on the surface of the water. Two major mechanisms of surface wave formation by winds (the Miles-Phillips Mechanism) and other sources (ex. earthquakes) of wave formation can explain the generation of wind waves.
 
However, if one set a flat water surface (Beaufort Point,0) and abrupt cross wind flows on the surface of the water, then the generation of surface wind waves can be explained by following two mechanisms which are initiated by normal pressure fluctuations of turbulent winds and parallel wind shear flows.

===The mechanism of the surface wave generation by winds===
[[File:Sjyang waveGeneration.png|thumb|The wave formation mechanism]]

1) Starts from "Fluctuations of wind" (O.M.Phillips) : the wind wave formation on water surface by wind is started by a random distribution of normal pressure acting on the water from the wind. By the mechanism developed by O.M. Phillips (in 1957), the water surface is initially at rest and the generation of wave is
initiated by adding turbulent wind flows and then, by the fluctuations of the wind, normal pressure acting on the water surface. This pressure fluctuation arise normal and tangential stresses to the surface water, and generates wave behavior on the water surface.
{''Assumptions''  
1. water originally at rest
2. water is inviscid   
3. Water is irrotational  
4. Random distribution of normal pressure to the water surface from the turbulent wind
5. Correlations between air and Water motions are neglected}&lt;ref name="Phillips, O. M. 1957"&gt;Phillips, O. M. (1957), "On the generation of waves by turbulent wind", Journal of Fluid Mechanics 2 (5): 417–445, {{Bibcode|1957JFM.....2..417P}}, {{doi|10.1017/S0022112057000233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2) starts from "wind shear forces" on the water surface (J.W.Miles, applied to mainly 2D deep water gravity waves) ; John W. Miles suggested a surface wave generation mechanism which is initiated by turbulent wind shear flows Ua(y), based on the inviscid Orr-Sommerfeld equation in 1957. He found the energy transfer from wind to water surface as a wave speed, c is proportional to the curvature of the velocity profile of wind Ua’’(y) at point where the mean wind speed is equal to the wave speed (Ua=c, where, Ua is the Mean turbulent wind speed). Since the wind profile Ua(y) is logarithmic to the water surface, the curvature Ua’’(y) have negative sign at the point of Ua=c. This relations show the wind flow transferring its kinetic energy to the water surface at their interface, and arises wave speed, c.

the growth-rate can be determined by the curvature of the winds ((d^2 Ua)/(dz^2 )) at the steering height (Ua  (z=z_h)=c) for a given wind speed Ua
{''Assumptions''; 
1. 2D parallel shear flow, Ua(y)
2. incompressible, inviscid water / wind
3. irrotational water
4. slope of the displacement of surface is small}&lt;ref&gt;Miles, J. W. (1957), "On the generation of surface waves by shear flows", Journal of Fluid Mechanics 3 (2): 185–204, {{Bibcode|1957JFM.....3..185M}}, {{doi|10.1017/S0022112057000567}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, these wave formation mechanisms occur together on the ocean surface and arise wind waves and grows up to the fully developed waves.

For example,&lt;ref&gt;[http://oceanworld.tamu.edu/resources/ocng_textbook/chapter16/chapter16_04.htm Chapter 16 - Ocean Waves]&lt;/ref&gt;

If we suppose a very flat sea surface (Beaufort number, 0), and sudden wind flow blows steadily across the sea surface, physical wave generation process will be like;

1. Turbulent wind flows form random pressure fluctuations at the sea surface. Small waves with a few centimeters order of wavelengths is generated by the pressure fluctuations. (The Phillips mechanism&lt;ref name="Phillips, O. M. 1957"/&gt;)

2. The cross wind keeps acting on the initially fluctuated sea surface, then the waves become larger. As the waves become larger, the pressure differences increase along with the wave growth, then the wave growth rate increases. Then the shear instability expedites the wave growth exponentially. (The Miles mechanism&lt;ref name="Phillips, O. M. 1957"/&gt;)

3. The interactions between the waves on the surface generate longer waves (Hasselmann et al., 1973&lt;ref&gt;Hasselmann K., T.P. Barnett, E. Bouws, H. Carlson, D.E. Cartwright, K. Enke, J.A. Ewing, H. Gienapp, D.E. Hasselmann, P. Kruseman, A. Meerburg, P. Mller, D.J. Olbers, K. Richter, W. Sell, and H. Walden. Measurements of wind-wave growth and swell decay during the Joint North Sea Wave Project (JONSWAP)' Ergnzungsheft zur Deutschen Hydrographischen Zeitschrift Reihe, A(8) (Nr. 12), p.95, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;) and the interaction will transfer wave energy from the shorter waves generated by the Miles mechanism to the waves have slightly lower frequencies than the frequency at the peak wave magnitudes, then finally the waves will be faster than the cross wind speed (Pierson &amp; Moskowitz&lt;ref&gt;Pierson, Willard J., Jr. and Moskowitz, Lionel A. Proposed Spectral Form for Fully Developed Wind Seas Based on the Similarity Theory of S. A. Kitaigorodskii, Journal of Geophysical Research, Vol. 69, p.5181-5190, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;).

((NOTE: Most of the wave speeds calculated from the wave length divided by the period are proportional  to  sqrt (length). Thus, except for the shortest wave length, the waves follow the deep water theory described in the next section. The 28&amp;nbsp;ft long wave must be either in shallow water or between deep and shallow.))

== Dissipation ==
The dissipation of swell energy is much stronger for short waves, which is why swells from distant storms are only long waves. The dissipation of waves with periods larger than 13 seconds is very weak but still significant at the scale of the Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;''Observation of swell dissipation across oceans'', F. Ardhuin, Collard, F.,  and B. Chapron, 2009: Geophys. Res. Lett. 36, L06607, {{doi|10.1029/2008GL037030}}&lt;/ref&gt; These long swells lose half of their energy over a distance that varies from over 20,000&amp;nbsp;km (half the distance round the globe) to just over 2,000&amp;nbsp;km. 
This variation was found to be a systematic function of the swell steepness: the ratio of the swell height to the wavelength. The reason for this behaviour is still unclear, but it is possible that this dissipation is due to the friction at the air-sea interface.

== Swell dispersion and wave groups ==
Swells are often created by storms thousands of [[nautical mile]]s away from the beach where they break, and the propagation of the longest swells is only limited by shorelines. For example, swells generated in the Indian Ocean have been recorded in California after more than half a round-the-world trip.&lt;ref&gt;''Directional recording of swell from distant storms'', W. H. Munk, G. R. Miller, F. E. Snodgrass, and N. F. Barber, 1963: Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc. London A 255, 505&lt;/ref&gt; This distance allows the waves comprising the swells to be better sorted and free of [[wikt:chop|chop]] as they travel toward the coast.  Waves generated by storm winds have the same speed and will group together and travel with each other, while others moving at even a fraction of a metre per second slower will lag behind, ultimately arriving many hours later due to the distance covered.  The time of propagation from the source ''t'' is proportional to the distance ''X'' divided by the wave period ''T''.  In deep water it is &lt;math&gt;t = 4 \pi X /( g T) &lt;/math&gt; where g is the acceleration of gravity. For a storm located 10,000&amp;nbsp;km away, swells with a period ''T''=15 s will arrive 10 days after the storm, followed by 14 s swells another 17 hours later, and so forth.

This dispersive arrivals of swells, long periods first with a reduction in the [[Frequency#Period versus frequency|peak wave period]] over time, can be used to tell the distance at which swells were generated.

Whereas the sea state in the storm has a [[frequency spectrum]] with more or less the same shape (i.e. a well defined peak with dominant frequencies within plus or minus 7% of the peak), the swell spectra are more and more narrow, sometimes as 2% or less, as waves disperse further and further away. The result is that wave groups (called sets by surfers) can have a large number of waves.  From about seven waves per group in the storm, this rises to 20 and more in swells from very distant storms.

== Coastal impacts ==
Just like for all water waves, the energy flux is proportional to the significant wave height squared times the [[group velocity]]. In deep water, this group velocity is proportional to the wave period. Hence swells with longer periods can transfer more energy than shorter wind waves. Also, the amplitude of [[infragravity waves]] increases dramatically with the wave period (approximately the square of the period), which results in 
higher [[run-up (disambiguation)|run-up]].

As swell waves typically have long wavelengths (and thus a deeper wave base), they begin the refraction process (see [[water waves]]) at greater distances offshore (in deeper water) than locally generated waves.

&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stormsurf.com/page2/tutorials/wavebasics.shtml Wave Basics (Stormsurf)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since swell-generated waves are mixed with normal sea waves, they can be difficult to detect with the naked eye (particularly away from the shore) if they are not significantly larger than the normal waves.  From a [[signal analysis]] point of view, swells can be thought of as a fairly regular (though not continual) wave signal existing in the midst of strong noise (i.e., normal waves and chop).

== Navigation ==
Swells were used by [[Polynesia]]n navigators to maintain course when no other clues were available, such as on foggy nights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museum.upenn.edu/Navigation/putting/putting.html Micronesian Navigation - University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Tone''''' was a bi-monthly magazine combining coverage of technological developments in New Zealand and from around the world with reviews on the latest consumer products available in New Zealand. 

==History and profile==
It was [[Parkside Media]]'s third magazine, following ''[[NZ Classic Car]]'' and ''[[NZ Performance Car]]''. ''Tone'' was started in 1999.&lt;ref name=nbr/&gt; Until issue 32, the magazine was bi-monthly. A change was made to monthly, but as of issue 73 (November/December 2008), it returned to bi-monthly.

''Tone'''s offices were in [[Grey Lynn]], [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]]. The magazine ceased publication in December 2011.&lt;ref name=nbr&gt;{{cite news|author=Chris Keall|title=Tone magazine suspends publishing|url=http://www.nbr.co.nz/article/tone-magazine-suspends-publishing-ck-103025|accessdate=6 November 2015|work=NBR|date=15 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Masthead design==
''Tone'''s logo featured a small coloured triangle. Internally this was called 'Jerry'. Jerry changes colour each issue to match the cover design. Version 2 of the logo appeared in issue 32 when the magazine changed to monthly. Version 3 of the logo appeared in issue 44. Version 4 of the logo appeared in issue 67 and changed the [[tagline]] to ''Gadgets | Hi-fi | Home theatre'', from ''Technology to change your life''.

==Magazine contents==
As of the November/December 2008 issue, the typical magazine contents included:
* News
* Toneworld (short product overviews)
* Reviews (detailed product tests)
* Entertainment (CD, DVD, game reviews)
* Readers' letters
* Contributor columns
* Feature stories (event reviews, technical tips and tricks, how-to articles, company overviews)

[[File:Surfer 2.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Surfing]] on shoaling and [[breaking wave]]s.]]
[[File:Phase and group velocity as a function of depth.svg|right|thumb|300px|The [[phase velocity]] ''c''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; (blue) and [[group velocity]] ''c''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; (red) as a function of water depth ''h'' for [[surface gravity wave]]s of constant [[frequency]], according to [[Airy wave theory]]. &lt;br&gt;Quantities have been made [[dimensionless]] using the [[Earth's gravity|gravitational acceleration]] ''g'' and [[frequency|period]] ''T'', with the deep-water [[wavelength]] given by ''L''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''gT''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/(2π) and the deep-water phase speed ''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''L''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;/''T''. The grey line corresponds with the shallow-water limit ''c''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=''c''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;√(''gh''). &lt;br&gt;The phase speed – and thus also the wavelength ''L''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''c''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''T'' – decreases [[monotonic function|monotonically]] with decreasing depth. However, the group velocity first increases by 20% with respect to its deep-water value (of ''c''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|1|2}}''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''gT''/(4π)) before decreasing in shallower depths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Oceanographical Engineering |last=Wiegel |first=R.L. |publisher=Dover Publications |year=2013 |isbn=0-486-16019-X |page=17, Figure 2.4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In [[fluid dynamics]], '''wave shoaling''' is the effect by which [[ocean surface waves|surface waves]] entering shallower water change in [[wave height]]. It is caused by the fact that the [[group velocity]], which is also the wave-energy transport velocity, changes with water depth. Under stationary conditions, a decrease in transport speed must be compensated by an increase in [[energy density]] in order to maintain a constant energy flux.&lt;ref name=lon64&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Longuet-Higgins |first1=M.S. |last2=Stewart |first2=R.W.  | title = Radiation stresses in water waves; a physical discussion, with applications | journal = Deep-Sea Research and Oceanographic Abstracts | volume = 11 | number = 4 | pages = 529–562 | year = 1964 | url = http://chinacat.coastal.udel.edu/cieg682/protect/longuet-higgins-stewart-dsr64.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shoaling waves will also exhibit a reduction in [[wavelength]] while the [[frequency]] remains constant.

In [[Waves and shallow water|shallow water]] and parallel [[depth contour]]s, non-breaking waves will increase in wave height as the [[wave packet]] enters shallower water.&lt;ref name=wmo98&gt;{{cite book | last=WMO | year=1998 | title=Guide to Wave Analysis and Forecasting | volume=702 | publisher=World Meteorological Organization | edition=2 | isbn=92-63-12702-6 | 
url=http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/amp/mmop/documents/WMO%20No%20702/WMO702.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is particularly evident for [[tsunami]]s as they wax in height when approaching a [[coast]]line, with devastating results.

==Mathematics==

Waves nearing the coast change wave height through different effects. Some of the important wave processes are [[refraction]], [[diffraction]], [[reflection (physics)|reflection]], [[wave breaking]], [[wave–current interaction]], friction, wave growth due to the wind, and ''wave shoaling''. In the absence of the other effects, wave shoaling is the change of wave height that occurs solely due to changes in mean water depth – without changes in wave propagation direction and [[dissipation]]. Pure wave shoaling occurs for [[wave crest|long-crested]] waves propagating [[perpendicular]] to the parallel depth [[contour line]]s of a mildly sloping sea-bed. Then the wave height &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; at a certain location can be expressed as:&lt;ref name=god00/&gt;&lt;ref name=dal91/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;H = K_S\; H_0,&lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;K_S&lt;/math&gt; the shoaling coefficient and &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; the wave height in deep water. The shoaling coefficient &lt;math&gt;K_S&lt;/math&gt; depends on the local water depth &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; and the wave [[frequency]] &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; (or equivalently on &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; and the wave period &lt;math&gt;T=1/f&lt;/math&gt;). Deep water means that the waves are (hardly) affected by the sea bed, which occurs when the depth &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is larger than about half the deep-water [[wavelength]] &lt;math&gt;L_0=gT^2/(2\pi).&lt;/math&gt; 

===Wave shoaling===
[[File:Propagation du tsunami en profondeur variable.gif|right|thumb|When waves enter shallow water they slow down. Under stationary conditions, the wave length is reduced. The energy flux must remain constant and the reduction in group (transport) speed is compensated by an increase in wave height (and thus wave energy density).]]
[[File:Mavericks wave diagram.gif|thumb|right|Convergence of wave rays (reduction of width &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;) at [[Mavericks, California]], producing high [[surfing]] waves. The red lines are the wave rays; the blue lines are the [[wavefront]]s. The distances between neighboring wave rays vary towards the coast because of [[refraction]] by [[bathymetry]] (depth variations). The distance between wavefronts (i.e. the wavelength) reduces towards the coast because of the decreasing [[phase speed]].]]
[[File:Shoaling coefficient as a function of depth.svg|thumb|right|Shoaling coefficient &lt;math&gt;K_S&lt;/math&gt; as a function of relative water depth &lt;math&gt;h/L_0,&lt;/math&gt; describing the effect of wave shoaling on the [[wave height]] – based on [[conservation of energy]] and results from [[Airy wave theory]]. The local wave height &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; at a certain mean water depth &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is equal to &lt;math&gt;H=K_S\;H_0,&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; the wave height in deep water (i.e. when the water depth is greater than about half the [[wavelength]]). The shoaling coefficient &lt;math&gt;K_S&lt;/math&gt; depends on &lt;math&gt;h/L_0,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;L_0&lt;/math&gt; is the wavelength in deep water: &lt;math&gt;L_0=gT^2/(2\pi),&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; the [[frequency|wave period]] and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; the [[gravity of Earth]]. The blue line is the shoaling coefficient according to [[Green's law]] for waves in shallow water, i.e. valid when the water depth is less than 1/20 times the local wavelength &lt;math&gt;L=T\,\sqrt{gh}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=dal91/&gt;]]

For non-[[breaking wave]]s, the [[energy flux]] associated with the wave motion, which is the product of the [[wave energy]] density with the [[group velocity]], between two [[ray tracing (physics)|wave rays]] is a [[conservation of energy|conserved quantity]] (i.e. a constant when following the energy of a [[wave packet]] from one location to another). Under stationary conditions the total energy transport must be constant along the wave ray – as first shown by [[William Burnside]] in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = On the modification of a train of waves as it advances into shallow water | first = W. | last = Burnside |author-link = William Burnside | year = 1915 | journal =  Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society | series = Series 2 | volume =  14 | pages = 131–133 | doi = 10.1112/plms/s2_14.1.131 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
For waves affected by refraction and shoaling (i.e. within the [[geometric optics]] approximation), the [[rate of change (mathematics)|rate of change]] of the wave energy transport is:&lt;ref name=dal91/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{ds}(b c_g E) = 0,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is the co-ordinate along the wave ray and &lt;math&gt;b c_g E&lt;/math&gt; is the energy flux per unit crest length. A decrease in group speed &lt;math&gt;c_g&lt;/math&gt; and distance between the wave rays &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; must be compensated by an increase in energy density &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;. This can be formulated as a shoaling coefficient relative to the wave height in deep water.&lt;ref name=dal91&gt;{{cite book | title=Water wave mechanics for engineers and scientists | author=Dean, R.G. |author2=Dalrymple, R.A.  | year=1991 | series=Advanced Series on Ocean Engineering | volume=2 | publisher=World Scientific | location=Singapore | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9-M4U_sfin8C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Water%20wave%20mechanics%20for%20engineers%20and%20scientists&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false | isbn=978-981-02-0420-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=god00&gt;{{cite book | first=Y. | last=Goda | title=Random Seas and Design of Maritime Structures | year=2010 | series=Advanced Series on Ocean Engineering | volume=33 | publisher=World Scientific | location=Singapore | edition=3 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=kneahaZ-2UQC&amp;lpg=PR2&amp;dq=Random%20Seas%20and%20Design%20of%20Maritime%20Structures.%20Advanced%20Series%20on%20Ocean%20Engineering&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false | isbn=978-981-4282-39-0 |pages=10–13 &amp; 99–102 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For shallow water, when the [[wavelength]] is much larger than the water depth, wave shoaling satisfies [[Green's law]]:
:&lt;math&gt;H\, \sqrt[4]{h} = \text{constant},&lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; the mean water depth, &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; the wave height and &lt;math&gt;\sqrt[4]{h}&lt;/math&gt; the [[fourth root]] of &lt;math&gt;h.&lt;/math&gt;

===Refraction effects===
Following Phillips (1977) and Mei (1989),&lt;ref name=phi77&gt;{{cite book | first=Owen M. | last=Phillips | year=1977 | title=The dynamics of the upper ocean (2nd ed.) | isbn=0-521-29801-6 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | url=https://www.google.com/books?id=fYk6AAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PP9&amp;ots=htfM77pfaz&amp;dq=phillips%20dynamics%20of%20the%20upper%20ocean&amp;lr=&amp;pg=PA23#v=onepage&amp;q=phillips%20dynamics%20of%20the%20upper%20ocean&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mei89&gt;{{cite book | first=Chiang C. | last=Mei | author-link=Chiang C.

:&lt;math&gt;S = S(\mathbf{x},t), 0\leq S&lt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt;. 
The local [[wave vector|wave number vector]] is the gradient of the phase function, 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{k} = \nabla S&lt;/math&gt;, 
and the [[angular frequency]] is proportional to its local rate of change, 
:&lt;math&gt;\omega = -\partial S/\partial t&lt;/math&gt;. 
Simplifying to one dimension and cross-differentiating it is now easily seen that the above definitions indicate simply that the rate of change of wavenumber is balanced by the convergence of the frequency along a ray; 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial k}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial \omega}{\partial x} = 0&lt;/math&gt;. 
Assuming stationary conditions (&lt;math&gt;\partial/\partial t = 0&lt;/math&gt;), this implies that wave crests are conserved and the [[frequency]] must remain constant along a wave ray as &lt;math&gt;\partial \omega / \partial x = 0&lt;/math&gt;.
As waves enter shallower waters, the decrease in [[group velocity]] caused by the reduction in water depth leads to a reduction in [[wave length]] &lt;math&gt;\lambda = 2\pi/k&lt;/math&gt; because the nondispersive [[Waves and shallow water|shallow water limit]] of the [[Dispersion (water waves)|dispersion relation]] for the wave [[phase speed]], 
:&lt;math&gt;\omega/k \equiv c = \sqrt{gh}&lt;/math&gt;
dictates that 
:&lt;math&gt;k = \omega/\sqrt{gh}&lt;/math&gt;,
i.e., a steady increase in ''k'' (decrease in &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;) as the [[phase speed]] decreases under constant &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Western Indian Ocean Marine Science Association (WIOMSA)&lt;ref&gt;http://wiomsa.net&lt;/ref&gt;''' is a regional professional, non-governmental, non-profit, membership organization, registered in [[Zanzibar, Tanzania]]. The organization is dedicated to promoting the educational, scientific and technological development of all aspects of marine sciences throughout the region of Western [[Indian Ocean]] ([[Somalia]], [[Kenya]], [[Tanzania]], [[Mozambique]], South [[Africa]], [[Comoros]], [[Madagascar]], [[Seychelles]], [[Mauritius]], [[Réunion]] (France)), with a view toward sustaining the use and conservation of its marine resources. The association has about 1000 individual members as well as about 50 institutional members from within and outside the region.&lt;ref&gt;http://wiomsa.net/wiomsav2/index.php/pages/history/ ''WIOMSA'' Western Indian Ocean Marine Science Association, February 18, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization's inter-disciplinary memberships consist of marine scientists, [[coastal]] [[wikt:practitioner|practitioner]]s, and [[institutions]] involved in the advancement of marine [[science]] research and development. The association:

# provides a forum for communication and exchange of information amongst its members that promotes and fosters inter-institutional linkage within and beyond the region;
# supports marine research by offering research [[grants]];
# implements programs to build the capacity of marine scientists and coastal [[management]] practitioners;
#works to promote [[policy]] dialogue on key topics by organizing meetings and seminars on the findings and [[policy]] implications of [[science]].

WIOMSA [http://wiomsa.net] promotes marine [[science]] research through the award of research grants under the '''Marine Science for Management (MASMA)'''&lt;ref&gt;http://wiomsa.net/wiomsav2/index.php/research-support/masma&lt;/ref&gt; and the '''Marine Research Grant (MARG)'''&lt;ref&gt;http://wiomsa.net/wiomsav2/index.php/research-support/marg&lt;/ref&gt; programmes. MASMA is a competitive research [[grant (money)|grant]] scheme designed to support research activities in the region as well as organisation of training courses/[[workshop]].

==Marine Science in the Western Indian Ocean (WIO) region==

Marine and coastal management requires scientific and technical information on both natural (physical, chemical, [[biological]], etc.) and social (institutions, [[knowledge]], [[perceptions]], [[economic]] and [[cultural]] values, etc.) processes to identify and define priority environment issues as well as to define alternative solutions and strategies. It is therefore essential that appropriate environmental information is available for assessment of impacts of existing and planned activities, and that a sound scientific base exists which can accommodate the changing needs of [[environmental management]] institutions as well as society at large. However, experience shows that knowledge generated is often not effectively used in management processes.

In the past two decades, the '''Western Indian Ocean (WIO)'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wcs.org/where-we-work/oceans/west-indian-ocean.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; region has seen a significant increase in research [[Research|studies]] conducted on different aspects of the marine and coastal environment at a local, [[nation]]al or [[regional]] level. This has led to the strengthening of the knowledge base within these environments and increased [[awareness]] of important marine and coastal issues. Research capacity has also been strengthened in many [[discipline (specialism)|discipline]]s.

At both national and regional levels, a number of important [[initiatives]] have been put in place in the recent past, seeking to improve both understanding and management of the [[Marine biology|marine]] and coastal environment. Governments’ efforts, together with those of donor-supported projects and programmes, have allowed countries in the region to considerably strengthen the management of their marine and environment. The cumulative effect of such [[initiatives]] is evidenced, for example, by the fact that all the governments in the WIO region &lt;ref&gt;http://www.wcs.org/where-we-work/oceans/west-indian-ocean.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; have initiated the [[implementation]] of integrated coastal zone management to a greater or lesser extent, as well as the process of formulating policies and [[legislation]] focusing on these marine and coastal environments. In many cases governments have established dedicated units for dealing with marine and coastal issues. In addition, a number of marine protected areas have been established in priority areas.

Despite these efforts, the management of the marine and coastal environment in the WIO remains a challenge. While most countries in the WIO region have put in place [[policy]], legal, [[regulatory]] and institutional frameworks that are relevant to the protection and management of the marine and coastal environment, most countries have not succeeded in reversing the trend of degradation in coastal and marine [[ecosystems]]. This is attributed to, amongst others factors, sometimes inappropriate, ineffective and/or inadequate [[governance]] structures. These weaknesses in governance are reflected as [[policy]] and [[legislative]] inadequacies; limited institutional capacity; inadequate awareness; inadequate financial mechanisms; and poor [[knowledge management]] [http://www.unep.org/NairobiConvention]

Research in the WIO region is undertaken mainly by Universities, Government-affiliated research institutes, national and regional [[NGOs]], and by scientists from outside of the region. With the exception of the research initiatives undertaken by Government-affiliated research institutes, research by other organizations is not necessarily aligned to the needs of management authorities. The research agenda of Government-affiliated research institutes such as the '''Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute (KMFRI)''';&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kmfri.co.ke/&lt;/ref&gt; '''Tanzania Fisheries Research Institute (TAFIRI)'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tafiri.go.tz/&lt;/ref&gt; and '''IIP'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mozpesca.gov.mz/index.php/en/&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Mozambique]] should generally be guided by the [[management objectives]] of the departments or [[Ministry (government department)|Ministries]] to which they are affiliated.

The strategic objective and priorities of WIOMSA are:

# Fostering research excellence through facilitating the development and updating of a regional a research agenda, supporting improvements in research quality, and supporting the development of a [[critical mass]] of excellent scientists in all relevant disciplines;
# Developing expertise for effective management and [[sustainable]] development;
# Raising public [[awareness]] and enhancing access to relevant knowledge and information;
# Promoting networking, [[cooperation]] and exchange of knowledge between [[researchers]], managers and local [[communities]]; and
# Promoting and [[advocating]] appropriate [[policies]] and practices.

Based on these priorities, WIOMSA work initially emphasised three programme areas i.e. scientific research, capacity building and communication &amp; extension; with more focus recently on capacity development, information dissemination, partnerships and networking. In this regard, WIOMSA’s activities fall within five broad programmatic areas:

* '''Capacity Development.'''

Overall goal of the association’s capacity development programme is to develop technical and managerial capacity as well as professionalism, and build the capability of scientists and practitioners to meet the existing and future challenges of coastal and marine management in the WIO region and beyond. WIOMSA and its partners have been at the forefront of initiating innovative and pioneering capacity building programme, which have often been replicated in other regions. The capacity development programme includes short and long-term training courses, development and dissemination of training materials and tools, and the provision of technical support to organizations e.g. recent international training course in mangrove ecosystems (http://inweh.unu.edu/mangrove-wio-region/),. Through its '''Marine and Coastal Science for Management (MASMA)''' Programme, WIOMSA has supported experts from the region to pursue MSc and PhD degrees, while the '''Marine Research Grants (MARG)'''&lt;ref&gt;http://wiomsa.net/wiomsav2/index.php/research-support/marg&lt;/ref&gt; Program has provided partial support to individuals registered at universities within the region to enable travel for research purposes.

* '''Scientific Research'''.

WIOMSA uses two competitive grant programmes, MASMA and the MARG as mechanisms to address priority issues, improving research quality and developing research capacity in all relevant disciplines. MASMA is designed to support regional research activities as well as organisation of training courses/workshop and publication of books/manuals.

There are two competitive research [[grants]] under the MASMA Programme, the ‘Open’ Competitive research grant programme which covers any topic within the priority themes as suggested by applicants, and the ‘Commissioned’ Competitive research grant programme which covers specific topics that emerge as critical during the course of the Programme. Ideas for ‘Commissioned’ grants come from the Programme Committee.

MARG aims at providing young and upcoming scientists with a reliable and flexible mechanism to turn their ideas into research projects and also offers opportunity for presentation of research results at various regional and international fora. There are three types of '''MARG grants, MARG I (research), MARG II (travel to laboratories outside your country for data analysis) and MARG III (travel grant to attend conferences)'''.

* '''Information dissemination and Communication.'''

Information dissemination and [[communication]] are core activities of WIOMSA and are integrated into all objectives of the association. WIOMSA’s approaches to information dissemination and communication include '''publication'''[http://www.wiomsa.org/publications] of '''books/manuals'''[http://www.wiomsa.org/book-series], [[policy]] briefs [http://www.wiomsa.org/policy-briefs], regional [[Scientific journal|Journal]]/peer-reviewed papers [http://www.wiomsa.org/special-issues-of-journals], [[newsletters]], magazines [http://www.wiomsa.org/wiomsa-magazine], [[flyer (pamphlet)|flyer]]s and [[brochures]] and production of CD-ROMS, DVDs, and TV programmes designed to serve the needs of a wide range of audiences. The WIOMSA website and blog provide news and announcements, while events such as the biennial WIOMSA [[Scientific]] [[Symposium]] serve as major hubs for exchange and dissemination of information.

* '''Partnerships/Networking.'''

WIOMSA promotes [[partnerships]]/networks through a number of approaches such as linking multiple scientific domains e.g. connecting social and [[natural sciences]] through the competitive grant programme; institutional partnerships beyond the academic sphere where a number of science to policy initiatives have been facilitated e.g. through '''WIO-C''', a network of implementing agencies active in marine conservation, '''Nairobi''' Convention (Nairobi Convention UNEP/Nairobi Convention Secretariat and WIOMSA, 2009); and linkages across geographic boundaries e.g. WIO-COMPAS Programme with the Coastal Resource Center of the University of Rhode Island (http://wiomsa.net/wiocompas/) and Memoranda of Understanding with different organizations e.g. Odinafrica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.odinafrica.org/index.php/news/128-ninth-wiomsa-scientic-symposium |title=Ninth WIOMSA Scientific Symposium of the Western Indian Ocean Marine Science Association (WIOMSA) |publisher=ODINAFRICA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304074825/http://www.odinafrica.org/index.php/news/128-ninth-wiomsa-scientic-symposium |archivedate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WIOMSA provides opportunities through its activities for networking amongst researchers and between [[researchers]] and other stakeholders in the region. Most of WIOMSA’s activities are carried out in partnership with national institutions and regional and international organizations e.g. The Nairobi Convention [[Nairobi Convention]]

===MASMA Projects===

'''The Marine and [[Coastal]] Science for Management (MASMA)[http://wiomsa.net/wiomsav2/index.php/research-support/masma] programme''' is the regions’ first competitive research grant mechanism and was established in 2000 to provide funding and technical support for coastal and marine research, capacity development, and communication of research results in the WIO region. The MASMA programme aims to contribute to the knowledge base on the coastal and marine environments of the region, to raise awareness on important issues, to conduct and coordinate research activities of national and regional importance, as well as to disseminate information and data in support of the [[sustainable]] use of coastal and marine resources. The MASMA programme is also seen as an effective means to bolster and maintain regional research [[wikt:capacity|capacity]] in key research areas central to sustainable coastal [[resource management]] in the WIO region.

MASMA encourages and supports multi/trans-disciplinary research efforts and promotes regional collaboration in research amongst experts from the different countries in the region and partnerships between scientists from within and outside the region. It also aims at building [[professionalism]] and competence amongst regional [[researchers]] in designing and coordinating regional research [[projects]].

MASMA provides an exceptional foundation for addressing the pressing environmental issues of the region in a collaborative and structured manner. As a regional programme, MASMA provides a number of benefits:

With limited human capacity and [[financial]] [[resources]] to fund research at the national level, MASMA as a regional programme provides an opportunity for countries in the region to access funds and human capacity that they would not have been able to mobilize in normal circumstances.

The MASMA programme contributes towards facilitating access for regional experts to international research and networks leading to the [[internationalization]] of their institutions and research work.

Between 2000 and 2011 WIOMSA supported at least 40 regional projects, which have contributed to the increased knowledge base on the [[coastal]] and marine environments of the region and raised awareness on important management issues. However, outputs and outcomes of these projects are not well known outside [[project]] teams as there has been no strategy both at the [[project]] and WIOMSA level to use these projects as flagships for the purpose of raising their visibility as well as that of WIOMSA.

In the current phase, six [[projects]] have been approved so far covering topics ranging from [[adaptation]] to [[climate change]] at local government and [[community]] level; integration of [[science]] into '''MPA''' management; and linking [[marine science]], [[traditional knowledge]] and [[cultural]] perceptions to develop future marine management frameworks using spatial simulation tools and educational games; identification and effective integrated management of [[dugongs]] and their [[habitats]]; use of the [[adaptive management]] approach to build the capacity of communities to implement [[fisheries]] management [[interventions]]; and assessment of the scale and impacts of [[bycatch]] in [[fisheries]] across the region.

These [[projects]] are not only [[multi-disciplinary]] with involvement of social and natural scientists working at different levels from the community to regional levels, but are implemented in all countries of the WIO except [[Somalia]], and involve management authorities, research institutions, [[non-governmental]] organizations and the [[private sector]]. Further, all these [[projects]] have developed coherent [[communication]] and dissemination plans outlining how their outputs and results will be communicated to the potential end users including the [[general]] [[public]], [[policy]] makers and the [[scientific community]].

'''Charles Émile Blanchard''' (6 March 1819 – 11 February 1900) was a  [[France|French]] [[zoologist]] and [[entomologist]].

==Career== 

Blanchard was born in [[Paris]]. His father was an [[artist]] and [[natural history|naturalist]] and Émile began natural history very early in life. When he was 14 years old, [[Jean Victoire Audouin]] (1797—1841), allowed him access to the laboratory of the [[Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle]]. In 1838, he became a technician or ''préparateu''r in this then, as now, famous institution. In 1841, he became assistant-naturalist.

He accompanied [[Henri Milne-Edwards]] (1800—1885) and [[Jean Louis Armand de Quatrefages de Breau]] (1810—1892) to [[Sicily]] on a [[marine zoology]]  expedition. He published, in 1845 a ''Histoire des insectes'', or History of the insects and, in 1854—1856 ''Zoologie agricole'' or Agricultural Zoology. This last work is remarkable: it presents in a precise way the harmful or pest species and the damage they cause to various crop plants. This work was illustrated by his father. Blanchard was critical of [[Darwinism]]. He argued that [[Charles Darwin]]'s pigeon studies were unscientific and that his ideas about [[evolution]] were false and unoriginal.&lt;ref name="Glick 1988"&gt;Glick, Thomas F. (1988). ''The Comparative Reception of Darwinism''. University of Chicago Press. p. 148. {{ISBN|0-226-29977-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burkhardt, Frederick. (2010). ''Introduction''. In ''The Correspondence of Charles Darwin: Volume 18; Volume 1870''. Cambridge University Press. p. 21. {{ISBN|978-0-521-76889-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1870, Blanchard and [[Charles-Philippe Robin]] opposed the election of Darwin as a corresponding member of the [[French Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref name="Glick 1988"/&gt;

He published an atlas of the anatomy of the [[vertebrate]]s which appeared between 1852 and 1864. This publication raised his hopes to obtain the [[Chair (official)|chair]] of [[reptile]]s and [[fish]] at the Natural History Museum left vacant by the death of [[Auguste Duméril]] (1812—1870) but it was finally [[Léon Vaillant]] (1834—1914) who was selected. However,  in 1862, he was given the chair  of natural history of [[Crustacean|Crustacea]], [[Arachnida]] and [[Insect]]s. He left this in 1894 following his infirmity. He was elected, in 1862 into the [[Academy of Science]]. He began to lose his sight after 1860 and became blind in 1890. He died in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120724124107/http://gap.entclub.org/taxonomists/Blanchard/index.html Global Ant Project]&lt;/ref&gt;
