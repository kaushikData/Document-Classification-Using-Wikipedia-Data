'''''A History of English Medieval Architecture''''' is a book published in three volumes in 1912, re-published in two volumes in 1921 and one volume in 1931, by architect and artist [[Cyril Edward Power]]. It features 424 of his drawings and illustrations and was published by Talbot Press.

On July 5, 1912, ''Building News'' stated: "While the ordinary reader will scan the book with pleasurable interest, the architectural student of Mediaeval architecture who believes - some still believe it, we suppose even in these days - that structural integrity was the raison d'être of Gothic art, will follow Mr Power's intelligent exposition with profit, and find stimulation to further study."

Power states that the purpose of the book is to "make the various stages of early life in these islands intelligible."

These books were the outcome of a series of lectures Power gave in 1907 at [[Goldsmiths College]] New Cross. The books were renowned for their intricate detail and exhaustive research. Shortly after their publication, Powers began lecturing in architecture at [[The Grosvenor School of Modern Art]].

'''Advocacy and incitement''' are two categories of speech, the latter of which is a more specific type of the former directed to producing imminent lawless action and which is likely to incite or produce such action. In the 1957 case ''[[Yates v. United States]]'', Justice [[John Marshall Harlan II]] ruled that only advocacy that constituted an "effort to instigate action" was punishable. 

In the 1969 case ''[[Brandenburg v. Ohio]]'', the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled that a statute that punishes mere advocacy and forbids, on pain of criminal punishment, assembly with others merely to advocate the described type of action, falls within the condemnation of the [[First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution|First]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution|Fourteenth Amendments]]. Justice [[Louis Brandeis]] argued in ''[[Whitney v. California]]'' that "even advocacy of violation, however reprehensible morally, is not a justification for denying free speech where the advocacy falls short of incitement and there is nothing to indicate that the advocacy would be immediately acted on." {{law-stub}}

'''Alta Vista''' or '''Chalchihuites''', is an [[archaeological site]] near the municipality of [[Chalchihuites]] in the [[Mexican state]] of [[Zacatecas]], in the northwest of Mexico. It is located the west of Cerro Sombrerete in the northwestern corner of the Durango state, it is believed that the site was a cultural oasis that was occupied more or less continuously from AD 100 to AD 1400.&lt;ref name=INAH&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |date= |title=Página Web de INAH Chalchihuites |trans-title=INAH Chalchihuites Official Web Page |journal=[[INAH]] |location=Mexico |url=http://www.gobiernodigital.inah.gob.mx/ZonasArqueologicas/todas/htme/za02702.html |language=Spanish |accessdate=Sep 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925102150/http://www.gobiernodigital.inah.gob.mx/ZonasArqueologicas/todas/htme/za02702.html |archivedate=2010-09-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site is within the "Sierra de Chalchihuites" – from the [[Nahuatl]] word chalchíhuitl, the name means "precious Stone", where the Chalchihuites-Chichimec culture was established.

The Altavista name is due to a ranch that existed in the vicinity, at the time when archaeologist Manuel Gamio visited the area.  There are opinions that this ceremonial center was developed by the súchil branch of the Chalchihuites culture.&lt;ref name=Eventola&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |date=2008-10-28 |title=Altavista Zona Arqueológica |trans-title=Archaeological Site Altavista |journal= |location=Chalchihuites, Zacatecas, México |url=http://www.eventola.com/locationViewer.php?lid=771 |language=Spanish |format= |accessdate=Sep 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710205912/http://www.eventola.com/locationViewer.php?lid=771 |archivedate=2011-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is related to the Chalchihuites culture that flourished during the [[Mesoamerican chronology|mesoamerican classical period]], it had a social and political structure; had a hieroglyphical writing system. And constructed formal cities and ceremonial centers, as they had urbanization techniques, a numbering system, astronomy, and other important knowledge. These people were known as Chalchihuites, found sufficient elements to favor their social, economic and military life, thus decided to settle here.&lt;ref name=Aztlan&gt;{{cite web|first= |last= |title=Articulo Zona Arqueologica Alta Vista, enlace permanente |url=http://noticias.aztlanvirtual.com/2007/12/100-aos-de-excavaciones-en-la-zona.html |publisher=Aztlan  Virtual &amp; [[INAH]] |location= |language=Spanish |trans-title=Altavista archaeological site, permanent link article |year=2007 |accessdate=Sep 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101015054403/http://noticias.aztlanvirtual.com/2007/12/100-aos-de-excavaciones-en-la-zona.html |archivedate=2010-10-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

AltaVista was a control center for the turquoise trade route, originating in the [[Oasisamerica|oasis-American]] mines of [[New Mexico]]. Population decayed towards the year 800 CE, following a disastrous dry spell that ruined farming in the Mexican semi desert.

Altavista flourishing is estimated towards years 400 to 650 CE; e.g., in the classical period, the Chalchihuites cultural and ceremonial center represents the maximum northern expansion of Mesoamerica.

This culture spread on the corridor of the eastern flanks of the Sierra Madre Occidental, from west of the State of Zacatecas to Durango, between 100 and 1250 CE., approximately. It is considered a border culture or "culture of transition", according to archaeologist Manuel Gamio classification of mesoamerican sedentary groups and [[hunter-gatherer]] [[Chichimec]] groups that inhabited the arid northern plateau.

==Site History==
In 1908 Manuel Gamio performed the first scientific excavations in northern Mexico. In Alta Vista he explored the zone now known as the Columns Hall and the annexed stairway; he also made preliminary investigations of the "caverns" in the region, which he considered defensive refuges.&lt;ref&gt;Gamio, Manuel. 1908&lt;/ref&gt;

The site was not investigated anymore until 1971, when J. Charles Kelley initiated an extensive excavation of the site. The knowledge of the Chalchihuites site and culture that today is available, is due to the 30 years of studies made by Kelley and associates in the region of the Zacatecas and Durango States.&lt;ref name=Kelley&gt;{{cite journal |first= Charles F.|last= Kelley |title= Altavista Zona Arqueológica |url= |journal= Investigaciones de Chalchihuites |location=Zacatecas, México |language= Spanish|trans-title=Altavista Archaeological Site |year= 1971–1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Kelley, the Alta Vista ceremonial center was a designed and built between 450-470 CE. It has been demonstrated that it was not randomly drawn and constructed, but based on a precise location and directions from the Chapín hill, which is a plateau located seven kilometers to the southwest of the ceremonial center where two circle-cross petroglyphs were found, resembling those found at Teotihuacan. From those stone-glyphs, during the summer solstice a sun alignment is projected onto a summit that arises in the Colorado River, known as Picacho Mountain. The Peak, as well, is related to the Labyrinth of the archaeological site of Alta Vista.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;&lt;ref name= Kelley/&gt;

==The Site==
Alta Vista is located almost on the Tropic of Cancer and is oriented such that the corners of the main structures coincide with the cardinal points axes; this is not very common in Mesoamerica.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

The Chalchihuites investigation works of Phil Weigand, found evidence of more than 750 prehispanic mines; probably the Mesoamerican area with greater mining activity. Also, turquoise imported from distant deposits was found; probably originating from the US southwest, over a thousand kilometers north of Chalchihuites.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

Per Kelley investigation, during its apogee, Altavista played a role similar to other Classic period Mesoamerican ceremonial centers, but on a key Chichimec area. This meant that economic activities and local trade existed, exchange of resources with foreign groups at regional level, from mining exploitation and a political control, which for Chalchihuites included construction and maintenance of religious and civic structures from 450 to 850 CE approximately.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;&lt;ref name= Kelley /&gt;

Ceremonial centers such as Alta Vista, with its sophisticated characteristics related to the complex Mesoamerican ritual ideology, are important to understand the nature of ties that Teotihuacán managed to establish in different parts of Mesoamerica. Traders, priests groups and merchants that managed to integrate the incipient regional elites within trade networks and established routes to maintain these activities; they were, probably one of the integrating forces of the classic Mesoamerica.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

==Site Orientation==
The archaeological site was built according to the precise location and orientation of two hills, one is Chapín, seven kilometers southeast, where the two circle-cross petroglyphs were found (similar to those in [[Teotihuacán]]). From there the sun alignment on the other hill can be seen, Picacho Pelón, aligned with the Altavista labyrinth, (see below) a hallway limited by adobe walls and embedded pilasters. At the end of the corridor is the Observatory, from which the first equinox sun rays peek over the top of the hill.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

The perfect orientation of the civic or main plaza towards the four cardinal points evidences the enormous knowledge possessed by these ancient people of the Astral and magnetic poles.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

Another construction, is the "Columns Hall", it has been confirmed that it is a lunar calendar, which consists of four parallel rows of seven columns, which are equivalent to the 28-day lunar cycle.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;
 
The archaeological site is located near the Tropic of Cancer and is believed to be one of the main astronomical observatories in Mesoamerica. Its location allows perfect observation the Sun equinoxes and solstices steps in relation to the Sun rising by surrounding hills: Chapín, Pedregoso and Picacho.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

==Structures==
It is apparent that most of the constructions on this site have not yet been explored.

There are two regular size civic plazas, each has a mound in the Center, it is assumed that these were used for human sacrifices, or for people involved in ceremonies or competition. It is worth mentioning, in the east plaza, has more hierarchical spaces, and it leads to believe that these were reserved for regional representatives of native groups, when events took place.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

===Column Hall===
This is earliest site structure. It is an enclosure with square base that contains vestiges of a quadrangular chamber with 28 columns that were roof support. The space is divided into four parallel rows of seven columns each, with different sizes and shapes. It is inferred that this was a calendar in which the equivalence of the lunar cycle of 28 days is evident. The hall was constructed over a masonry platform, integrated to a patio with a central altar and an elevated perimeter corridor or walkway.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

During excavations it was detected that the structure was carefully laid out, using a lay out post system, that served to fix dimensions to the lines of the inferior and outer walls; these posts were kept and covered with stucco.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

It is believed that the original building had an open patio in center and that in time the structure was modified by adding columns to support a complete roofing system. In a later stage, it was filled up to turn it a platform that supported a superior structure, today has disappeared.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

===Gamio Stairway===
The so-called "Gamio Stairs" were probably an access to the above building. It is noted that several columns seem to have been reinforced; in addition, some reinforcement was added to the outer walls, it is inferred that there were some structural faults in the structure.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

A multiple burial was found near the northern lower corner of the structure, including four ceramic vessels as offerings, apparently associated with the four cardinal points. The vessel bodies are decorated with an eagle holding serpents and lightning with its beak and claws. It is inferred that the building was a temple dedicated to the cult of God [[Tezcatlipoca]], the Nocturnal Jaguar God of Northern Skies.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

===Sun Pyramid===
Investigation work in 1976 by Kelley and his team, determined that this pyramid is the last of three constructive stages. On top they found remains of a temple with battlements. Inside the pyramid is a crypt that contained remains of three individuals with very elaborated offerings, it is believed that they were priest-governors associated to the solar cult.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;&lt;ref name= Kelley /&gt;

===Skull Temple===
It is located southwest of the Sun Pyramid, the adobe walls and floors were stuccoed in repeated occasions. A 70 centimeters small entrance is located in the center of the southeastern wall. Two 40 centimeters diameter floor holes were found that are believed to have served as foundation for two wood posts which held a roof bracket for ceiling support. In center is a rock furnace with adobe stucco; it measures, approximately, two square meters. A Concentration of disarticulated human bones was found on the floor of this structure, mainly skulls, jaws and long bones, most of the skulls display perforations in the apex, as well as two leg bones with traces of ropes [[Mecate (rein)]] tied in the ends. It has been deduced that the skulls and long bones hung from the ceiling and that they could represent trophies or offerings associated to human sacrifice.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

This practice of human sacrifice with ritual exhibition appears in the river basin of Mexico in the Postclassical period (900-1519 CE.) as the [[Tzompantli]] architectonic element, it suggests a relation between the mountain groups of this northern region with those of the Mexico central plateau.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

=== Labyrinth===
[[File:El Laberinto.JPG|thumb|"El Laberinto"]]
Located next to the Columns Hall. It is a long corridor with masonry walls; it is made up of a series of returns and pillars with diverse angles. More detailed Inspection showed several additions or corrections that were made throughout the corridor. It has been demonstrated that the eastern extension of the corridor and the summit of the Picacho hill are aligned at the raising of the equinoctial sun.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

Apparently the sun on the horizon, behind Picacho, illuminates the labyrinth with a direct light beam; hence it is called the "solar path". The precision used to draw up and build this structure is emphasized, so that it could work as a solar calendar instrument. On one side of the labyrinth is a set of rooms, a hall and an atrium, which is identified as the Astronomers Palace.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

===Other structures ===
There are many structures yet to be studied. On a platform southwest of the patio are vestiges of three structures; a central pyramid and small enclosures to both sides.

==Site negligence==
Chalchihuites population is concerned about the lack of security in the area and safety lacking for the important and valuable collection of archeological pieces housed at the Museum.&lt;ref name=Winter&gt;{{cite web |first=   Rubén |last=  Valdez |title= Denuncian descuido en museo de Alta Vista, Chalchihuites, Zacatecas |url=  http://www.oem.com.mx/elsoldezacatecas/notas/n1677110.htm|publisher=   El Sol de Zacatecas |location= Cultura Local |language=Spanish |trans-title=Negligence denounced in Alta Vista, Chalchihuites, Zacatecas |date= June 18, 2010|accessdate=Sep 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''black beret''' is a type of headgear commonly worn by armoured forces around the world including the [[British Army]]'s [[Royal Tank Regiment]] (RTR), the [[Royal Canadian Armoured Corps]] (RCAC), and the [[Royal Australian Armoured Corps]] (RAAC). Notable non-armoured units to wear the black beret include the [[Russian Naval Infantry]] (and formerly [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]) and [[Russia]]n [[OMON]] units, the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) [[Tactical Air Control Party]] (TACP), [[Philippine National Police-Special Action Force]] (PNP-SAF) members, and the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] ("navy blue"). It was also worn by the United Kingdom's [[Royal Observer Corps]] (ROC) with their [[Royal air force|Royal Air Force]] (RAF) uniform, [[Metropolitan Manila Development Authority]] (MMDA).

Perhaps the most famous Commonwealth wearer of the black beret was [[Field Marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] [[Bernard Law Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Montgomery]] who wore a [[Royal Tank Regiment]] (RTR) beret complete with [[cap badge]], presented to him by the regiment, to which he added his own [[general]]'s (later [[field marshal]]'s) [[British Army officer rank insignia|rank insignia]].

==Original usage==
The black beret has its origins with the French 70th [[Chasseurs Alpins]] who influenced the British Royal Tank Corps beginning in 1918. General Sir [[Hugh Jamieson Elles]], together with Colonel Fuller came up with the idea of a black beret for the Royal Tank Corps. Black was selected as the colour because it was least likely to show oil stains, something which tank crewmen of that time (and now) could appreciate. It was approved for wear with the [[Royal Tank Corps]] by HM [[King George V]] on 5 March 1924.

The Black Beret remained the exclusive distinctive headdress of the Royal Tank Corps  in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.australian-armour.com/Black%20Beret.html,&lt;/ref&gt;

When uniforms were issued to the [[Royal Observer Corps]] there was a surplus of Royal Armoured Corps black berets that were given to the unit.

==United States military usage==
In the United States military, the beret was unofficially worn by a variety of special operations units during and following World War II. In the spring of 1951, the 10th and 11th Ranger Companies wore black berets during their training at [[Camp Carson]], Colorado, before their deployment to Japan.
===Black berets in the U.S. Air Force===
[[File:Earning the black beret 150417-F-GO396-301.jpg|thumb|[[United States Air Force Tactical Air Control Party|US Air Force's Tactical Air Control Party]] beret, flash, and crest]]
In 1979, the black beret was authorized for wear by enlisted personnel in the Tactical Air Control Party. In 1984, two airmen from Pope Air Force Base, North Carolina submitted the current flash and badge design. It was approved for all TACP airmen in 1985. Tactical Air Control Party specialists (AFSC 1C4X1) are currently the only United States Air Force specialty allowed to wear the coveted black beret as part of their daily duty uniform wear.&lt;ref&gt;"U.S. Military Beret History (Page 2)". Usmilitary.about.com. 2001-10-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Black berets in the U.S. Army===
[[File:YoungestBeret1stBattalion23rdInfantryRegiment.jpg|right|thumb|A soldier from 1st Bn, [[23rd Infantry Regiment|23rd Inf Reg]], [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd ID]] wearing the black beret (2001)]]
In 1973, permission was granted to local commanders to encourage distinctive, morale-enhancing uniform items and the black beret was adopted by armor and armored cavalry units in the United States.

A black beret was authorized for wear by female soldiers in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;p.223 Stanton, Shelby ''U.S. Army Uniforms of the Cold War 1948–1973'' 1994 Stackpole Books&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 30, 1975, it was officially assigned as part of the newly created battalions of [[United States Army Rangers]] who had worn it unofficially during the Vietnam War.

In 1979, the army chief of staff ruled that the black beret was restricted to just ranger and airborne units (the latter receiving their distinctive maroon berets on November 28, 1980). However, since June 14, 2001, the black beret is worn by all [[United States Army]] troops unless the soldier is approved to wear a different distinctive beret. The Rangers now wear [[tan beret]]s in reverence to the buckskins worn by [[Rogers' Rangers]] during the [[French and Indian War]].

The black beret is worn as part of the [[Army Service Uniform]] (ASU), the U.S. Army's dress uniform. It also became the official garrison headgear to be worn with the [[Battle Dress Uniform]] (BDUs) in 2001, and from 2005 the [[Army Combat Uniform]] (ACU). The change was implemented by General [[Eric Shinseki]], the Army Chief of Staff at the time, who stated that it was about promoting "...our values as an institution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Defense Leaders Uphold Army's Black Beret Decision (Corrected Copy) |url=http://archive.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=45776 |website=archive.defense.gov |accessdate=June 16, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From the beginning, the beret was unpopular with soldiers, because the headgear required two hands to put it on, could not be carried in the pocket when not worn (as the patrol cap could), and provided no shade from the sun when worn.

Despite years of negative feedback, the beret remained part of the ACU until 2011, when incoming Sergeant Major of the Army [[Raymond F. Chandler]] made it his first order of business to address the wishes "thousands of soldiers" who wanted the army to end the wear of the beret with the ACU, and the army subsequently did just that.&lt;ref name="Army Dumps Beret"&gt;{{cite web|title=Army dumps beret as official ACU headgear|url=http://www.armytimes.com/article/20110613/NEWS/106130309/Army-dumps-beret-official-ACU-headgear|archive-url=https://archive.is/20140220043908/http://www.armytimes.com/article/20110613/NEWS/106130309/Army-dumps-beret-official-ACU-headgear|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2014-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Pierce-Lunderman | first1=Cursha | title=Bye-Bye, Beret: Switch to Patrol Cap Brings Mixed Feelings | url=https://www.army.mil/article/60276/Bye_bye__beret__Switch_to_patrol_cap_brings_mixed_feelings | date=June 23, 2011 | publisher=U.S. Army| accessdate=March 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Shaughnessy | first1=Larry | title=Army Backtracks on Black Berets After More than a Decade of Debate | url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/06/13/army.beret/ | date=June 14, 2011 | publisher=CNN | accessdate=March 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The black beret remained the headgear for the ASU, but was replaced as the default headgear with the ACU patrol cap.&lt;ref name="Beret replacement"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lopez|first1=C.

===Black berets in the U.S. Navy===
====Male black beret====
During the [[Vietnam War]] the U.S. Navy personnel assigned to [[Patrol Boat, River|patrol boats]] wore the [[Republic of Vietnam Navy|South Vietnamese navy]] black beret with badge. Unit tradition had the back ribbon cut into two pennants after first contact with the enemy with the ends of the pennant notched in a "V" to signify he had made an enemy "kill".&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas J. Cutler|Cutler, Thomas J.]] (2000) ''Brown Water, Black Berets''. Naval Institute Press, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; 
====Female black beret====
Until October 2016, a black beret was authorized to be worn,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/support/uniforms/uniformregulations/Documents/01NOVSOC.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20070521043303/http://buperscd.technology.navy.mil/bup_updt/508/unireg/chapter3/3500_seriesArticles/3501_3.htm&lt;/ref&gt; albeit solely by female U.S. Navy sailors of all ranks.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20110831052528/http://timemilitary.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/unif-navy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Female commissioned officers wore the U.S. Navy officer crest on the beret above the left eyebrow, female petty officers and seamen wore the combination cover's device, and female chief petty officers wore their rate insignia instead. The female black beret's usage was discontinued along with the officer's tiara by the navy in 2016 as part of a naval effort to reduce the number of uniform items, make them appear more unisex, and also due to a lack of widespread use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=NAVADMIN 208/15|url=http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/reference/messages/Documents/NAVADMINS/NAV2015/NAV15208.txt|date=September 2015|accessdate=March 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4384">[[File:UN prop marker.jpg|thumb|A property marker outside the [[United Nations]] building in New York City.]]
A unit of [[real estate]] or [[immovable property]] is limited by a legal '''boundary''' (sometimes also referred to as a '''property line''' or a '''lot line'''). The boundary (in Latin: ''limes'') may appear as a discontinuation in the terrain: a ditch, a bank, a hedge, a wall, or similar, but essentially, a legal boundary is a conceptual entity, a [[social construct]], adjunct to the likewise abstract entity of [[property rights]].

A [[cadastral map]] displays how boundaries subdivide land into units of [[ownership]]. However, the relations between society, owner, and land in any culture or [[jurisdiction]] is conceived of in terms more complex than a [[tessellation]]. Therefore, the society concerned has to specify the rules and means by which the boundary concept is materialized and located on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;Turk, Andrew (2007) Representations of Tribal Boundaries of Australian Indigenous Peoples and the Implications for Geographic Information Systems. pp 232 - 244 in Dyson, ''et al'', 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 'Western' version of the [[operationalization]] might be a legally specified procedure, performed by a [[Chartered Surveyor|chartered surveyor]], supported by statements from neighbors and pertinent documents, and resulting in official recording in the [[cadastre]] as well as boundary markings in the field. Alternatively, indigenous people represent boundaries through ephemeral performances, such as [[Songlines|song]] and dance, and, when in more permanent form, e.g. paintings or carvings, in artistic or metaphorical manner.&lt;ref&gt;Muecke, S., Benterrak, K., &amp; Roe P. (1984) Reading the country: An introduction to nomadology. Fremantle, W.A.: Fremantle Arts Centre Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Identifying boundaries ==
[[File:Property line, crossing is by revocable license only.jpg|thumb|A private property line plaque separating the private property and the public [[right of way]] on a [[sidewalk]] in [[New York City]]. It declares that the public may utilize the space inside the private property by a revocable license, to prevent it to become a [[prescriptive easement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jordan|first1=Cora|last2=Randolph|first2=Mary|title=Neighbor law : fences, trees, boundaries, and noise|date=1994|publisher=Nolo Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=9780873372664|edition=2nd|url=http://files.dnr.state.mn.us/forestry/easement/easementsacquiredbyuseofproperty.pdf|accessdate=26 July 2014|chapter=Easements Acquired by Use of Property|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318213516/http://files.dnr.state.mn.us/forestry/easement/easementsacquiredbyuseofproperty.pdf#|archive-date=2015-03-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Legal boundaries are usually established by a professional [[surveying|surveyor]] using a [[theodolite|transit]] and or modern [[Global Positioning System|Global Positioning System (GPS)]] technology. The coordinates of the property line are often described on a drawing called a "plot plan" or "[[plat]]" by indicating the length of the boundary along a specific compass bearing in relation to a verifiable "point of beginning". The [[metes and bounds]] method is also used to provide a legal description of a property.

On maps, the line may be marked with {{unichar|214a|PROPERTY LINE|size=200%|html=}}.

The &amp;#8522; symbol may also be used in architectural drawings and CAD design to show plates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Text Symbols and Special Characters Reference|url=https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/autocad/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2016/ENU/AutoCAD-Core/files/GUID-518E1A9D-398C-4A8A-AC32-2D85590CDBE1-htm.html|website=AutoDesk Knowledge Network|publisher=AutoDesk AutoCAD|accessdate=16 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5759">The '''Cambridge Digital Library''' is a project operated by the [[Cambridge University Library]] designed to make items from the unique and distinctive collections of Cambridge University Library available online. The project was initially funded by a donation of £1.5 million [[GBP]] from Dr. [[Leonard Polonsky]], with the purpose of developing the technical infrastructure and producing an initial batch of online content. The first step of the project, known as the Foundations Project, ran from mid-2010 to early 2014, and was themed around two main strands, [[Faith]] and  [[Science]].&lt;ref name=Jarvis&gt;{{cite news

The Library's collections include some of the earliest Qur'an fragments on parchment, a section of devotional works and mystic treatises, a unique copy of the Kitāb al-Tawhīd by al-Māturīdī, and the first known Qur'an commentary written in Persian. The Library also owns over 1000 manuscripts in Hebrew. They cover a wide range of texts, such as Bibles, commentaries, liturgy, philosophy, kabbalah, literature, and legal documents. There are scrolls and fragments of this information, however, the majority of these manuscripts are in [[codex]] form. The oldest piece which the library possesses in this particular collection is a copy of the 10 commandments written on papyrus. The Library's Christian pieces include the Codex Bezae Cantabrigiensis, an important [[New Testament]] manuscript, the moore Bede, and the book of Cerne. The Library also houses some of the earliest surviving Buddhist manuscripts. It plans to incorporate all of these into the digital library.&lt;ref name=found&gt;

'''Cerro Mesa Ahumada''' (Mesa Ahumada Hill) or '''Cerro Colorado,''' is a hill located in the north of [[State of Mexico]], in the borough of municipality of [[Tequixquiac]] and bordering the municipalities of [[Apaxco]] and [[Huehuetoca]] in the [[State of Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://subversiones.org/archivos/2162]&lt;/ref&gt; The hill has a height of {{convert|2250|m|ft}} above sea level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.milenio.com/region/Reforestan-Cerro-Mesa-especies-autoctonas_0_241776157.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The mountain is located at a southern pass leading out of the [[Mezquital Valley]].

==Geology==
Historically the small mountain had springs, but they have dried up. The land is volcanic rock, the age or edaphology is the [[durisol]], [[phaeozem]] and [[vertisol]], is soil classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www3.inegi.org.mx/sistemas/mexicocifras/datos-geograficos/15/15096.pdf# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-05-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808175457/http://www3.inegi.org.mx/sistemas/mexicocifras/datos-geograficos/15/15096.pdf# |archive-date=2016-08-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archeological site==

[[File:Petroglifo en Cerro Mesa Ahumada.JPG|thumbnail|200px|right|Petroglyphs on the rocks.]]

On the high [[mesa]], there is archeological site named ''Los Mogotes''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tequixquiac.gob.mx/wp-content/uploads/PLAN-DE-DESARROLLO-MUNICIPAL-TEQUIXQUIAC-MEXICO.pdf Plan de desarrollo municipal, Tequixquiac] Page 9, May 22, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; This place was occupied by Otomian-Nahua tribes, here not exist only a few simple pre-Hispanic basements on the northwest side of the mesa, there are also petroglyphs on the rocks.&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez Peláez, Maria Elena, Monografía municipal de Tequixquiac, Historia, Instituto Mexiquense de Cultura, Toluca de Lerdo, 1999. p.p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; This site was discover in 1984 by local people, is located in hillside of Mesa to 2250 msnm. when archeologists from INAH visited this area.&lt;ref&gt;El sitio arqueológico de Tequixquiac, México. López Warrio, Luis Alberto, Ortuño Cos, Francisco and Pulido Mendez, Salvador. INAH. 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

Los Mogotes has got 8 basements and small platform, these correspond to the so-called Coyotlatelco and Mazapa of late classic or epiclassical period (800-1000 a.C), this site was probably built for military activities for lookouts by Chichimeca people with astronomical observations, funeral activities and housing. The place has suffered looting, but were found some obsidian, stone utensils, human bones and mud bows.&lt;ref&gt;El sitio arqueológico de Tequixquiac, México. López Warrio, Luis Alberto, Ortuño Cos, Francisco and Pulido Mendez, Salvador. INAH. 1985. pp. 35-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

In east hillsides have got petroglyphs, are anthropomorphic figures of men and women, the engraving of a tonatiuh or tonalli, an ollin nahui, and concentric cross symbols that probably represent stars or locations.&lt;ref&gt;El sitio arqueológico de Tequixquiac, México. López Warrio, Luis Alberto, Ortuño Cos, Francisco and Pulido Mendez, Salvador. INAH. 1985. pp. 39-41.&lt;/ref&gt; The surroundings of the mesa was bound by many nomadic groups, soldiers and merchants, so it was a must watch and defense for the watchpoint because on the mesa the valleys are observed. In Tequixquiac (altepetl) many clashes occurred with Otomis, Aztecs, Tlaxcaltecs, Texcoco and Otumba people, the site on the mesa was necessary for watch people and warriors.&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez Peláez, Maria Elena, Monografía municipal de Tequixquiac, Historia, Instituto Mexiquense de Cultura, Toluca de Lerdo, 1999. p.p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flora &amp; fauna==
Cerro Mesa Ahumada is Central Mexican Plateau, here there is a diversity in plants and animals of template and semi-desertic climate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miambiente.com.mx/comunitarias/paso-mexiquense-37 Mi Ambiente]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dondeescurreelagua.blogspot.mx/2015/03/vamos-al-cerro.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The cause is speculation the authorities of the state government of Mexico on the Cerro Mesa Ahumada prompted former state government through the company Wilk SA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.excelsior.com.mx/opinion/el-santo/2015/05/29/1026580]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite what makes the act was repealed the proposal to create urban development plan because of high speculation was generated by the corruption of the PAN and PRI Tequixquiac and Apaxco mayors before state authorities.

'''Diepkloof Rock Shelter''' is a [[rock shelter]] in [[Western Cape]], South Africa in which has been found some of the earliest evidence of the human use of [[symbol]]s, in the form of patterns engraved upon [[ostrich]] eggshell water containers. These date around 60,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="Texier"&gt;Texier PJ, Porraz G, Parkington J, Rigaud JP, Poggenpoel C, Miller C, Tribolo C, Cartwright C, Coudenneau A, Klein R, Steele T, Verna C. (2010). "A Howiesons Poort tradition of engraving ostrich eggshell containers dated to 60,000 years ago at Diepkloof Rock Shelter, South Africa". ''Proceedings of the National Acadademy of Science'' U S A. 107: 6180–6185. {{doi|10.1073/pnas.0913047107}}  {{PMID|20194764}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tribolo"/&gt;

The symbolic patterns consist of lines crossed at right angles or oblique angles by hatching. It has been suggested that "by the repetition of this motif, early humans were trying to communicate something. Perhaps they were trying to express the identity of the individual or the group."&lt;ref name="Amos"&gt;Amos, J. (2010). [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8544332.stm Etched ostrich eggs illustrate human sophistication.] BBC News&lt;/ref&gt;

==Site description==

The cave is about {{convert|17|km}} from the shoreline of the [[Atlantic]] in a semi-arid area, near [[Elands Bay]] about {{convert|150|km}} north of [[Cape Town]].&lt;ref name="Tribolo"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tribolo | first1 = C. Mercier | last2 = Valladas | first2 = H. Joron J.L. | last3 = Guibert | first3 = P. | last4 = Lefrais | first4 = Y. | last5 = Selo | first5 = M. | last6 = Texier | first6 = P.-J. | last7 = Rigaud | first7 = J.-Ph. | last8 = Porraz | first8 = G. | last9 = Poggenpoel | first9 = C. | last10 = Parkington | first10 = J. | last11 = Texier | first11 = J.-P. | last12 = Lenoble | first12 = A. | year = 2009 | title = Thermoluminescence dating of a Stillbay–Howiesons Poort sequence at Diepkloof Rock Shelter (Western Cape, South Africa) | url = | journal = Journal of Archaeological Science | volume = 36 | issue = 3| pages = 730–739 | doi = 10.1016/j.jas.2008.10.018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It occurs in [[Quartzite|quartzitic sandstone]] in a [[butte]] that overlooks in an east direction {{convert|100|m}} above the [[Verlorenvlei River]]. It contains one of "most complete and continuous later [[Middle Stone Age]] sequences in southern Africa"&lt;ref name="Texier"/&gt; stretching from before 130,000 BP to about 45,000 BP and encompassing pre-Stillbay, [[Stillbay]], [[Howiesons Poort]], and post-Howiesons Poort periods. It is about {{convert|25|m}} wide and {{convert|15|m}} deep. Research is based upon finds discovered in a trench excavated within it that is {{convert|16|m}} across and {{convert|3.6|m}} in depth. The deposits consist of burnt and nonburnt organic residues and ash that came from hearths, ash dumps and burnt bedding.&lt;ref name="Texier"/&gt;

It was first excavated in 1973 by [[John Parkington]] and Cedric Poggenpoel.&lt;ref&gt;Parkington, J., Poggenpoel, C. (1987). "Diepkloof Rock Shelter". In: Parkington, J., Hall, M. (Eds.), ''Papers in Prehistory of the Western Cape, South Africa'', vol. 332. BAR International, pp. 269–293. {{ISBN|978-0-86054-425-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1999 it has been researched in a collaboration between the Department of Archaeology at the [[University of Cape Town]] and the Institute of Prehistory and Quaternary Geology at the [[University of Bordeaux]].&lt;ref name="Tribolo"/&gt;

At Diepkloof Rock Shelter (DRS), from 70-74 ka bifaces and bifacial points are present while less complex forms such as backed artifacts occur from 70 ka through 60 ka and are subsequently replaced with unifacial points. Quartz and quartzite predominate the earliest unit with few occurrences of silcrete. During 70-74 ka unit, silcrete has replaced quartz while quartzite is still fairly dominant. From 65-70 ka quartz becomes dominant again with quartzite also being present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mackay|first1=Alex|last2=Marwick|first2=Ben|title=Keeping your Edge: Recent Approaches to the Organisation of Stone Artefact Technology|date=2011|chapter=Costs and benefits in technological decision making under variable conditions: examples from the late Pleistocene in southern Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Engraved ostrich eggshell containers==

270 fragments of ostrich eggshell containers have been found covered with engraved geometric patterns. The fragments have a maximum size of 20–30&amp;nbsp;mm, though a number have been fitted into larger 80 × 40&amp;nbsp;mm fragments. It is estimated that fragments from 25 containers have been found. Eggshell fragments have been found throughout the period of occupation of the cave but those with engraving are found only in several layers within the [[Howiesons Poort]] period. These occur across 18 stratigraphic units, particularly those with the stratigraphic names Frank and Darryl. This suggests the tradition of engraving lasted for several thousand years.&lt;ref name="Texier"/&gt;

The engraving consists of abstract linear repetitive patterns, including a hatched band motif. One fragment has two parallel lines that might have been circular around the container.

It has been suggested that they form "a system of symbolic representation in which collective identities and individual expressions are clearly communicated, suggesting social, cultural, and cognitive underpinnings that overlap with those of modern people."&lt;ref name="Texier"/&gt; Moreover, they show "the development of a graphic tradition and the complex use of symbols to mediate social interactions. The large number of marked pieces shows that there were rules for composing designs but having room within the rules to allow for individual and/or group preferences."&lt;ref name="Texier"/&gt;

Earlier finds exist of symbolism, such as the 75,000-year-old engraved ochre chunks found in the [[Blombos cave]], but these are isolated and difficult to tell apart from meaningless doodles.&lt;ref name="Amos"/&gt;

The engravings are found on ostrich eggshells that were used as water containers. Ostrich eggshells have an average volume of 1 litre. They may have had drinking spouts, holes to enable them to be strung as a [[canteen (bottle)|canteen]] for easier carrying, and seem to have been part of "daily [[hunter-gatherer]] life".&lt;ref name="Texier"/&gt; They involved skill to make, with one of the researchers involved noting "Ostrich egg shells are quite hard. Doing such engravings is not so easy."&lt;ref name="Amos"/&gt;

==Local flora==

The preservation of organic matter such as wood, grass, seeds and fruits at the site has been described as "exceptional".&lt;ref name="Tribolo"/&gt; Pollen remains allow the identification of the local animals and plants. The Howiesons Poort period shows evidence for thicket or [[shrubland]] vegetation now usually found in gorges, such as [[Diospyros]], [[Cassine peragua]], [[Maytenus]], [[Rhus]], and [[Hartogiella schinoides]]. [[Afromontane]] trees found in the area, include [[Ficus]], ''[[Kiggelaria africana]]'', ''[[Podocarpus elongatus]]'', and ''[[Celtis africana]]''. This suggests a more diversely wooded riverine environment than now present in the area.&lt;ref name="Texier"/&gt;

==Animal remains==
Animal remains include those of [[mammal]]s, [[tortoise]]s and [[intertidal]] marine shells. Most bones found in the cave come from [[rock hyrax]], [[hare]]s, [[Bathyergus suillus|cape dune mole-rat]]s, [[steenbok]] and [[Raphicerus|grysbok]]. Animals from rocky environments are also found including [[klipspringer]], and [[Pelea capreolus|vaalribbok]]. There is also evidence of local grasslands, with remains of zebras, [[wildebeest]] and [[hartebeest]]. Hippopotamus and [[southern reedbuck]] came from the local river. The sea coast seems to have moved up the river, as there are fragments from [[black mussel]]s, [[Cymbula granatina|granite limpet]]s, and [[Cape fur seal]]s. Although there are ostrich-shell remains, no ostrich bones have been found.&lt;ref name="Texier"/&gt;

Tortoise bones are mostly those of the [[Chersina angulata|angulate tortoise]] that is still found in the area. These are noted to have been "remarkably large compared with their Late Stone Age counterparts, suggesting different intensities of predation between MSA and Late Stone Age populations".&lt;ref name="Texier"/&gt;

==Provincial Heritage Site==
[[File:Provincial Heritage Site Marker, Diepkloof Rock Shelter, Elands Bay.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Badge indicating that the Diepkloof Rock Shelter is a provincial heritage site]]
Diepkloof Rock Shelter was declared a provincial heritage site by [[Heritage Western Cape]] on the 23 September 2014 in terms of Section 27 of the National Heritage Resources Act.&lt;ref&gt;Provincial Notice 253/2014, Province of the Western Cape Provincial Gazette Extraordinary, No. 7310, Cape Town: 23 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt; This gives the site Grade II status and provides it with protection under South African heritage law.

In 2015, the South African government submitted a proposal to add the caves to the list of [[World Heritage Site]]s and it has been placed on the UNESCO list of tentative sites as a potential future 'serial nomination' together with [[Blombos Cave]], [[Pinnacle Point]], [[Klasies River Caves]], [[Sibudu Cave]] and [[Border Cave]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Emergence of Modern Humans: The Pleistocene occupation sites of South Africa|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/6050|website=UNESCO|accessdate=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[economy of the United States]] has been divided into [[economic sectors]] in different ways by different organizations.  The [[North American Industry Classification System]] (NAICS) was developed in 1997 and is used by the [[United States Census Bureau]], while the older [[Standard Industrial Classification]] is used at the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC).

==Economic Census==

The United States Census Bureau currently conducts a comprehensive Economic Census&lt;ref&gt;Economic Census:  https://www.census.gov/econ/census/&lt;/ref&gt; every five years.  The results of this survey are tabulated according to the NAICS and provide statistics about the U.S. economy.  The most recent data are from 2007.&lt;ref&gt;2007 Economic Census:  https://www.census.gov/econ/census07/&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2012 Economic Census is underway with the initial results to be available in December 2013.&lt;ref&gt;2012 Economic Census:  https://www.census.gov/econ/census/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparative statistics==

The Census Bureau releases sector-by-sector statistics on the number of establishments, total business activity, annual payroll, and number of paid employees.  A standardized classification of the economy into sectors makes it possible to compare census results over time.  However, to reflect the evolving nature of the economy, the NAICS is updated every five years.  Therefore, when comparing different censuses, a particular NAICS basis is usually specified.  The following data are based on a comparison of the 2007 and 2002 censuses using the 2002 NAICS basis and an older comparison of the 1997 and 2002 censuses using the older 1997 NAICS basis.  Thus, (*) the 1997 data are based on a slightly different classification than the 2007 and 2002 data.

'''El Manatí''' is an [[archaeological site]] located approximately 60&amp;nbsp;km south of Coatzacoalcos, in the municipality of [[Hidalgotitlán, Veracruz|Hidalgotitlán]] 27 kilometers southeast of Minatitlan in the [[Political divisions of Mexico|Mexican state]] of [[Veracruz]]. El Manatí was the site of a sacred [[Olmec]] [[sacrifice|sacrificial]] [[bog]] from roughly 1600 [[Common Era|BCE]] until 1200 BCE.
It is likely that this site was used for ritual ceremonies which included offerings of wooden sculptures, rubber balls, ceremonial axes, and other items, including the bones of infants – all found in an excellent state of preservation in the muck.  Most of the wooden sculptures are [[bust (sculpture)|busts]] created in the [[Olmec figurine#Elongated man|"elongated man"]] style and are the oldest wooden artifacts yet found in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Ortíz and Rodríguez (1999, p.225)&lt;/ref&gt; The rubber balls are also the earliest such items yet discovered&lt;ref&gt;Hosler ''et al.'' (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; and were possibly used in the [[Mesoamerican ballgame]].

==The Olmec Culture==
The Olmec were a [[Pre-Columbian]] civilization living in the [[tropics|tropical]] lowlands of south-central [[Mexico]], close to the border between the modern-day states of [[Veracruz]] and [[Tabasco]].  The Olmec flourished during [[Mesoamerica]]'s [[Mesoamerican chronology|Formative]] period, dating roughly from as early as 1500 [[Common Era|BCE]] to about 400 BCE. Pre-Olmec cultures had flourished in the area since about 2500 BCE, but by 1600-1500 BCE Early Olmec culture had emerged centered around the [[San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán]] site near the coast in southeast Veracruz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Olmecs : America's First Civilization|authorlink= Richard Diehl|last=Diehl|first=Richard A.|publisher=Thames and Hudson|year=2004|location=London|isbn=0-500-28503-9|pages=9–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were the first Mesoamerican civilization and laid many of the foundations for the civilizations that followed.&lt;ref&gt;See Pool, p. 2.  Although there is wide agreement that the Olmec culture helped lay the foundations for the civilizations that followed, there is disagreement over the extent of the Olmec contributions, and even a proper definition of the Olmec "culture".  See [[Olmec influences on Mesoamerican cultures]] for a more in depth treatment of this question.&lt;/ref&gt;  Among other "firsts", there is evidence that the Olmec practiced [[Bloodletting in Mesoamerica|ritual bloodletting]] and played the [[Mesoamerican ballgame]], hallmarks of nearly all subsequent Mesoamerican societies.

==The site==
El Manatí is located at the foot of Cerro Manatí, some 15&amp;nbsp;km (9.3&amp;nbsp;mi) southeast of the major Olmec center of [[San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán]].  It is notable among Olmec sites for the absence of contemporaneous local ceremonial or domestic architecture.

Archaeologists have identified three separate phases of deposits at El Manatí:

* Manatí A Phase (ca. 1700 - 1600 BCE)
* Manatí B Phase
* Macayal Phase (ca. 1040 BCE ± 150 years). The wooden busts were all found in this later phase.

El Manati may have been chosen as a sacred place because of one or more of its natural features:&lt;ref name="Rodríguez and Ortíz 1997, p.93"&gt;Rodríguez and Ortíz (1997, p.93)&lt;/ref&gt;

*The presence of a natural [[Spring (hydrosphere)|spring]], often a feature of [[Mesoamerica]]n sacred sites.
*The presence of red pigment, likely [[hematite]], which symbolized blood.
*Its location at the foot of a hill, Cerro Manatí.&lt;ref&gt;Cerro Manatí is a [[salt dome]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Many early Mesoamerican sites, including [[Chalcatzingo]], [[Teopantecuanitlan]], and [[Las Bocas]], were situated east or west of a prominent hill.&lt;ref name="Rodríguez and Ortíz 1997, p.93"/&gt;

==Discoveries==
[[File:Olmec Heartland Overview 4.svg|right|400px|thumb|El Manatí and other Olmec heartland archaeological sites.]]
Many artifacts have been found, among them wooden busts and rubber balls.

===Wooden Busts===
Of particular note are 37 wooden busts or sculptures recovered from the bogs in 1989 by [[INAH]] archaeologists, during the third excavation phase at El Manatí.&lt;ref&gt;After the wooden heads were excavated they were symbolically baptized and given personal names, following a petition to INAH by locals from the nearby [[Macayal]] community, in order to "expel the demons" (''pues había que quitarles el diablito'').&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=INAH&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first=   |date=  July 16, 2008|title="Enterramiento masivo en el cerro El Manatí" |trans-title=Mass burial in cerro El Manati |journal=INAH Bulletins |location= Mexico |url= http://dti.inah.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1048&amp;Itemid=150|language=Spanish |format= |accessdate=Sep 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These busts were unusually well-preserved, owing to the [[wikt:anaerobic|anaerobic]] conditions of their interment and a stable water temperature that impeded microbial decay.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt; Samples from two of these busts produced [[Carbon-14 dating]] results equivalent to a date of around 1200 BCE.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt; Carved from the wood of [[ceiba]] and [[jobo]] trees, almost all of the busts had been ritually buried and wrapped in mats (''[[petate]]s'') made from vegetable fibers—the earliest evidence of funeral wrappings in Mexico.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt; The number of busts interred at or around the same time has led the INAH researchers to speculate that some widespread calamity, such as flood or prolonged drought, encouraged the ancient community to increase their offerings made in supplication to the mountain deities.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

Despite the obviously stylized shape of the head, researchers suggest that, due to their individual expressions, the busts depicted actual persons.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Diehl (2004, p.45); also Ortíz and Rodríguez (1999, p.248), who comment: "the individuality of the busts could indicate that they were representations of chiefs, rulers, or persons who achieved a high level of prestige, leading to an attempt to immortalize them with images."&lt;/ref&gt;  The wooden busts were usually accompanied by other objects. For example:

*Sculpture 1 was associated with a wooden staff and a dark green ax ([[Celt (tool)|celt]]).
*Sculpture 2 was associated with a large obsidian flake, tied bundles of leaves and plants, a [[hematite]] ball, a pile of sandstone rocks "common to a number of other sculptures,"&lt;ref&gt;Ortíz and Rodríguez (1999, p.238)&lt;/ref&gt; as well as fragments of human infant bones. Nearby to its east was the skeleton of an infant.
*Sculptures 5, 6, &amp; 7 were interred as a group, each laid on their sides in a triangle, facing inward. These sculptures were associated with bundles of plant material and were covered with a mat. An incomplete wooden staff and an infant cranium were associated with this burial.

Some of these heads were stolen and later found in Germany in the hands of archaeological object traffickers.&lt;ref name=Univ &gt;{{cite journal |last= Aguilar |first=   Julio |date= June 25, 2008 |title= Se desconoce la magnitud del saqueo en Cerro Manatí, INAH guarda silencio sobre su autenticidad |trans-title=The magnitude of the looting in Cerro Manatí is unknown: INAH keeps quiet about its authenticity  |journal= El Universal |location= Mexico |language=Spanish |format= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mexico, these artifacts were stolen in the 1980s and passed through the hands of antiques dealer [[Leonardo Patterson]], who later transferred the artifacts to Germany. These artifacts ended up in the [[Bavarian State Archaeological Collection]]. In 2018, the two heads were repatriated to Mexico.&lt;ref name="DW.COM"&gt;{{cite web | title=Germany returns 3,000-year-old relics to Mexico - News - 20.03.2018 | website=DW.COM | url=http://www.dw.com/en/germany-returns-3000-year-old-relics-to-mexico/a-43058336 | access-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rubber Balls===
Twelve rubber balls associated with axe offerings were found El Manatí in 1989. Their surprisingly excellent state of preservation led archeologists to suspect that the balls had received a vulcanization type process, and it was found that the balls were made of two types of vulcanized latex.&lt;ref name= "  Aztlan" &gt;{{cite journal |last= |first=   |date= August 4, 2008|title= Los olmecas inventaron el proceso de vulcanización |trans-title=The Olmecs invented the vulcanization process |journal=  Aztlanvirtual.com e INAH|location=  |url= http://noticias.aztlanvirtual.com/2008/08/los-olmecas-inventaron-el-proceso-de.html |language=Spanish |accessdate=Sep 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ceremonial axes===
In addition to the dozen rubber balls and 37 wooden busts, excavation has turned up many [[jadeite]] ceremonial axes ([[celt (tool)|celts]]), pottery, [[Greenstone (archaeology)|greenstone]] beads arranged in clusters (likely once two separate necklaces), [[Olmec figurine#baby-face motif|"baby-face"]] figurine fragments, carved wooden staffs, ritual [[obsidian]] knives (with no evidence of use), bones of newborn or unborn infants, and human and animal bone fragments. Most of these objects within the bog were found to be carefully arranged rather than haphazardly deposited, pointing to a sacred sacrificial intent.

===Infant bones===
The bones of the newborn or unborn infants consisted of some whole skeletons as well as dismembered [[femur]]s and skulls. These remains are particularly intriguing since they point to the possibility of [[human sacrifice]], a ritual without direct evidence in the Olmec archaeological record. The infant remains are each associated with, and subordinate to, the burial of a wooden bust. It is not known how the infants died.&lt;ref&gt;Ortíz and Rodríguez (1999, p.249)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cocoa traces===
On July 30, 2008, INAH reported that testing of residues found in a ceramic container in El Manatí, Veracruz, dating from approximately 1750 BCE (at least between 1900 and 900 BCE), show that the container contained a cocoa drink base probably consumed by the elite of the site.&lt;ref name=Anc   &gt;{{cite web |first=  |last=  |title=  El Manatí, Veracruz - Formative Period Vessel (ca. 1750 BC) Containing Cacao-based Beverage Identified |url= http://ancient-mesoamerica-news-updates.blogspot.com/2008/07/ancient-mesoamerica-news-updates-2008_30.html |publisher=Ancient Mesoamerica |location=  |language= |trans-title=|date= July 30, 2008 |accessdate= Sep 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ceramic vessel, which has slightly divergent cylindrical walls, a flat bottom, black spots and a red [[Slip (ceramics)|slip]] on its bottom, was associated with other sumptuary objects.&lt;ref name=Anc   /&gt;  It is believed that this type of vessel was used for drinks such as "chicha" (maize beer), chocolate, and atole preparations which were consumed only by priests or other people of high social prestige.&lt;ref name=Anc   /&gt;  Content verification tests yielded the presence of [[Theobromine]], an essential cocoa component; chromatography and UV tests detected ions of cocoa's chemical components. This evidence predates other evidence found in Mayan areas of Belize and Puerto Escondido Honduras.&lt;ref name=Anc   /&gt;

==Olmec technology==
The Olmec knew how to produce [[rubber]] and various uses of it, and probably had technological processes for [[vulcanization]] and for waterproofing with tar.&lt;ref name=Bita &gt;{{cite web |first=  |last=  |title=  Proceso de vulcanización de más de 3 mil 500 años |url= http://bitacoracultural.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=633&amp;Itemid=99999999  |publisher= Bitacora, semanario cultural |location=  |language= Spanish |trans-title=Vulcanization Process of more than 3500 years  |date= July 22, 2008|accessdate= Sep 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After multiple studies by several specialists, it has been established that to create the rubber balls, the Olmecs mixed latex rubber (''[[Castilla elastica]]'') with latex from the flowering vine ''[[Ipomoea alba]]'', which is farmed in tropical regions of Mexico and contains latex sulphides.&lt;ref name=Bita   /&gt;

The chemical reaction produced by mixing the two allows vulcanization.&lt;ref name=Bita   /&gt;

The Olmecs obtained rubber or ''ulli'' by cutting an incision in the tree for the exuded [[latex]], which in its natural state is a sticky milky fluid and when dry is very fragile and will not retain a form.&lt;ref name=Bita   /&gt;

The ''Ipomoea alba'' was crushed and, in liquid form, mixed in a container with the latex. When this mixture solidifies, it forms a white mass and can be used to form balls.&lt;ref name=Bita   /&gt;

There were probably two techniques used for making the balls. The first was to spread the rubber on a flat surface, let it dry and cut it into small strips. The second method was to cook the rubber and then shape it into a ball: this required high heat or vulcanization.&lt;ref name=Bita   /&gt;

The '''Espresso Book Machine''' (EBM) is a [[print on demand]] (POD) machine that prints, collates, covers, and binds a single book in a few minutes.

The EBM is small enough to fit in a retail book store or small library room, and as such it is targeted at retail and library markets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cqresearcherblog.blogspot.com/2009/05/overview-of-report-on-future-of-books.html Overview of the report on "Future of Books"] CQ Researcher Blog. May 29, 2009. Retrieved 2011-07-28.&lt;/ref&gt; The EBM can potentially allow readers to obtain any book title, even books that are [[out of print]]. The machine takes a [[PDF]] file for input and prints, binds, and trims the reader’s selection as a [[paperback book]].&lt;ref name="PR Web"&gt;{{cite web

==History==
[[Jason Epstein]] gave a series of lectures in 1999 about his experiences in publishing. Epstein mentioned in his speech that a future was possible in which customers would be able to print an out-of-stock title on the spot, if a book-printing machine could be made that would fit in a store. He founded 3BillionBooks with Michael Smolens, a Long Island entrepreneur in Russia, and Thor Sigvaldason, a consultant at [[Price Waterhouse Coopers]]. At the time, Jeff Marsh, a [[St Louis]] engineer and inventor, had already constructed a prototype book printer that could both photocopy and bind. Marsh was working on this project for Harvey Ross, who held U.S. Patent 5,465,213.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ross|first=H.M.|title=System and Method of Manufacturing a Single Book Copy|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US5465213|publisher=U.S. Patent and Trademark Office|accessdate=18 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Zelchenko, a Chicago-based technologist and a partner of Ross in a related patent effort, worked with Marsh to prove the concept and also helped bring Marsh and other players together with several venture interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rose|first=M.J.|title=Twelve-minute Book Delivery|url=https://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2001/07/45228|accessdate=18 September 2013|newspaper=Wired|date=July 17, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ultimately Epstein, together with Dane Neller, former President and CEO of [[Dean and Deluca]], licensed Marsh's invention and founded On Demand Books.&lt;ref name="SMH"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ondemandbooks.com/history.htm About ODB: History], OnDemandBooks.com. Retrieved on 2009-06-03.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first Espresso Book Machine was installed and demonstrated June 21, 2007 at the [[New York Public Library]]'s Science, Industry and Business Library. For a month, the public was allowed to test the machine by printing free copies of [[public domain]] titles provided by the [[Open Content Alliance]] (OCA), a non-profit organization with a database of over 200,000 titles.&lt;ref name="PR Web"/&gt;

==Distribution==
The direct-to-consumer model supported by Espresso Book Machine eliminates the need for shipping, warehousing, returns and pulping of unsold books; it allows simultaneous global availability&lt;ref name="SMH"/&gt; of millions of new and backlist titles.

EBM books can also be made available for distribution through [[Lightning Source]], a subsidiary of [[Ingram Content Group]].

[[Image:Frivolous Fables frog and bull.gif|thumb|Illustration from ''Fables for the Frivolous'' by Guy Wetmore Carryl, with illustrations by [[Peter Newell]].]]

'''''Fables for the Frivolous''''', or ''Fables for the Frivolous (with Apologies to La Fontaine)'', is one of the earliest works by the American parodist [[Guy Wetmore Carryl]]. It was published by Harper &amp; Brothers in 1898.&lt;ref&gt;[https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000626090 Catalog record 000626090]. HathiTrust Digital Library.&lt;/ref&gt; These [[fables]] are adapted from [[Jean de La Fontaine]]'s original writings.  The [[Aesop]]-style fables are written in verse, and are light-hearted re-tellings of fables from two centuries before, each ending with a moral and a pun. Among the more celebrated of the fables are ''The Persevering Tortoise and the Pretentious Hare'', ''The Arrogant Frog and the Superior Bull'', and ''The Sycophantic Fox and the Gullible Raven''.

'''''Frigidaire''''' is an [[Italian language|Italian]] comics magazine published in [[Rome]], [[Italy]]. The magazine had significant effects on graphic design, illustrations and written speech in the country during the 1980s.&lt;ref name=aicf/&gt; From 2009 it is a supplement of ''[[Liberazione (newspaper)|Liberazione]]''.

==History and profile==
''Frigidaire'' was established in 1980.&lt;ref name=aicf&gt;{{cite web|title=Frigidaire|url=http://www.aicf.gr/en/7o-festibal/tribute/frigidaire-magazine|work=Athens International Comics Festival|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ars/&gt; The first issue appeared in December 1980.&lt;ref name=slum&gt;{{cite web|title=Frigidaire|url=http://www.slumberland.it/contenuto.php?id=11021|work=Slumberland|accessdate=17 August 2015|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The founders were Vincenzo Sparagna, [[Stefano Tamburini]], [[Filippo Scòzzari]], [[Andrea Pazienza]], [[Massimo Mattioli]], and [[Tanino Liberatore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Federico Pagello|title=Cannibale, Frigidaire and the multitude: Post-1977 italian comics through radical theory|journal=Studies in Comics|date=December 2012|volume=3|issue=2|url=http://www.intellectbooks.co.uk/journals/view-Article,id=14906/|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Simone Castaldi|title=Drawn and Dangerous: Italian Comics of the 1970s and 1980s|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qE9jl8PlHYEC&amp;pg=PR8|accessdate=17 August 2015|year=2010|publisher=Univ.

In addition to [[cartoons]] ''Frigidaire'' features [[avant-garde]] reportages and interviews&lt;ref name=aicf/&gt; and covers articles on [[visual art]].&lt;ref name=ars/&gt; It also includes investigative reports.&lt;ref name=ars/&gt; Over time the magazine became a mouthpiece for [[left-wing]] [[counterculture]] in the country.&lt;ref name=ars/&gt;

At the beginning of the 2000s the frequency of ''Frigidaire'' was switched to bi-monthly.&lt;ref name=slum/&gt; In 2003 Vincenzo Sparagna sold the publisher of the magazine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Aldo Ricci|title=‘Frigidaire’, abbasso la satira italiana!|url=http://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2015/01/20/frigidaire-abbasso-la-satira-italiana/1351959/|accessdate=17 August 2015|work=Il Fatto Quotidiano|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was temporarily ceased publication from April–May 2003 to 2006.&lt;ref name=slum/&gt; On 25 April 2009 the magazine began to be published as an insert of ''Liberazione'', a [[communist]] daily.&lt;ref name=slum/&gt;

In September 2002 the covers and some selected pages of the magazine were exhibited at the 7th International Comics Festival in [[Athens]].&lt;ref name=aicf/&gt;

A '''gorsedd''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|ɔr|s|ɛ|ð}} plural ''gorseddau'', is a community or meeting of modern-day [[bard]]s. The word is of Welsh origin, meaning "throne". It is often spelled '''gorsedh''' in [[Cornwall]] and '''goursez''' in [[Brittany]], reflecting the spellings in the [[Cornish language|Cornish]] and [[Breton language|Breton]] languages, respectively.

When the term is used without qualification, it usually refers to the national Gorsedd of [[Wales]], namely ''Gorsedd Beirdd Ynys Prydain'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gorsedd.org/ Gorsedd y Beirdd]&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "The Gorsedd of Bards of the Island of Britain". However, other gorseddau exist, such as the [[Cornish language|Cornish]] [[Gorsedh Kernow]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gorsethkernow.org.uk/ Byrth Gorseth Kernow – The Gorseth of the Bards of Cornwall]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Breton language|Breton]] [[Goursez Vreizh]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gorsedd.com/ Home]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
[[Image:Lady of Cornwall.jpg|thumb|250px|Lady of Cornwall and flower girls at the 2007 [[Gorsedh Kernow]] ([[Penzance]])]]

Gorseddau exist to promote literary scholarship and the creation of [[poetry]] and [[music]].&lt;ref&gt;Hanes Gorsedd y Beirdd Geraint &amp; Zonia Bowen; Barddas 1991&lt;/ref&gt; As part of this, their most visible activity can be seen at [[Eisteddfod]]au – Welsh language festivals.

==History==
[[Image:PhotoGorsedd.jpg|thumb|250px|Goursez Vreizh (the Gorsedd of [[Brittany]]) in 1906]]
Gorsedd Beirdd Ynys Prydain was founded in 1792 by Edward Williams, commonly known as [[Iolo Morganwg]], who also invented much of its ritual, supposedly based on the activities of the ancient [[Celts|Celtic]] [[Druidry]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gorsedd.org/hanes.php Gorsedd y Beridd] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725182049/http://www.gorsedd.org/hanes.php |date=2010-07-25 }} – Hanes (History). Accessed 5 December 2009. Welsh language page only.&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, much of its ritual has [[Christian]] influence, and were given further embellishment in the 1930s by Archdruid Cynan (1950–1954).{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} The Gorsedd y Beirdd made its first appearance at the Eisteddfod at the Ivy Bush Inn in Carmarthen in 1819, and its close association with the Festival has remained. It is an association of poets, writers, musicians, artists and individuals who have made a significant and distinguished contribution to Welsh language, literature, and culture.

The fictitious origin of these ceremonies was established by Professor G.J.Williams in works touching on Iolo Morganwg.&lt;ref&gt;Traddodiad Llenyddol Morgannwg, 1948&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ranks==
There are three ranks of membership in the Welsh Gorsedd. Until 2012 they were, in ascending order of honour:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/eisteddfod2008/sites/guide/history/pages/gorsedd.shtml|title=BBC Wales  - Eisteddfod - Guide  - What is the Gorsedd?|website=www.bbc.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Ovates]]'', who wear green robes,
* ''[[Bard]]s'', who wear blue robes, and
* ''[[Druid]]s'', who wear white robes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gorsedd.org/urddo.php Gorsedd y Beirdd] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929102642/http://www.gorsedd.org/urddo.php |date=2007-09-29 }} – Urddo (Order)&lt;/ref&gt;

However, since 2012 all these ranks are treated as equal, with new members all being called 'Druids' and with the colour of their robes reflecting the area of their contribution rather than an ascending order of honour. The head of a Gorsedd is known as an ''[[Archdruid|Archdderwydd]]'' (English: Archdruid), and wears a golden robe, and is elected for a term of three years, and is responsible for conducting the Gorsedd ceremonies during Eisteddfod week. These ceremonies are held to honour literary achievements amongst Welsh poets and prose writers. The ranks within the Breton Gorsedd (Goursez) are the same.

In the Cornish Gorsedd (Gorsedh Kernow), there is only one rank, that of bard, and all robes are blue.&lt;ref name="gorsethkernow.org.uk"&gt;[http://www.gorsethkernow.org.uk/english/ceremony.htm Gorseth Kernow – The Gorseth of Cornwall: Ceremonies and Regalia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206205704/http://www.gorsethkernow.org.uk/english/ceremony.htm |date=2010-02-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Admission==
In the Welsh Gorsedd, a person may become an ovate or a bard by passing an examination in the Welsh language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gorsedd.org/arholiadau.php Gorsedd y Beirdd] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929102637/http://www.gorsedd.org/arholiadau.php |date=2007-09-29 }} – Arholiadau (Exams)&lt;/ref&gt; Druids may only be nominated by existing druids. Often a new inductee will take a pseudonym, called a "[[bardic name]]." To become an Archdruid, an individual must have won one of the Eisteddfod's three highest awards: the [[Crowning of the Bard|Crown]], the [[Chairing of the Bard|Chair]], or the Literature Medal. In 2003, [[Robyn Léwis]] (Robyn Llŷn) became the first winner of the Literature Medal to be elected Archdruid, and the first Archdruid to be elected by a vote of all Gorseddogion. [[Christine James]] was the first woman to become Archdruid of Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-18563191|title=Woman archdruid for eisteddfod|date=2012-06-23|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-09-14|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People are also made ovates or druids as an honour to reward their contributions to [[Culture of Wales|Welsh culture]]. In 1946, the future [[Queen Elizabeth II]] was inducted into the Welsh Gorsedd at the [[National Eisteddfod of Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/911 Gorsedd of the Bards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110310082638/http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/911 |date=2011-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, [[Ron Davies (British politician)|Ron Davies]],&lt;ref&gt;His bardic name is Ron o [[Machen|Fachen]][http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/147017.stm BBC News UK Politics | Davies dons druid robes]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rowan Williams]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2173194.stm BBC NEWS   UK | When a druid isn't a druid]; his bardic name is Rowan ap Neurin.

==Ceremony==
Three Gorsedd ceremonies are held during the Eisteddfod week:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bbc.com/cymrufyw/28463489|title=Find out more about the druids and the gorsedd rituals|date=2017-07-06|work=BBC Cymru Fyw|access-date=2017-09-14|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Crowning (Coroni) of the Bard (awarded to the poet judged best in the competitions in free meter)
* The Awarding of the Prose Medal (for the winner of the Prose competitions)
* The Chairing (Cadeirio) of the Bard (for the best long poem in traditional strict metre).

During these ceremonies, the Archdruid and the members of the Gorsedd gather on the Eisteddfod stage in their ceremonial robes. When the Archdruid reveals the identity of the winning poet, the 'Corn Gwlad' (a trumpet) calls the people together and the Gorsedd Prayer is chanted (the Corn Gwlad symbolically calls everyone from the four corners of Wales). The Archdruid partially withdraws a sword from its sheath three times, and cries "''A oes heddwch''?" ("Is there peace?"), to which the assembly reply "''Heddwch''" ("Peace").  The sword is then placed fully back into its sheath, and hence is never drawn fully. Then the Horn of Plenty is presented to the Archdruid by a young local married woman, who urges him to drink the 'wine of welcome'.

==Symbolism==
[[File:Awen symbol final.svg|thumb|right|150px|Symbol of Gorsedd, the [[Awen]].]]
The symbol commonly used to represent a Gorsedd is a triple line, the middle line upright and the outer two slanted towards the top of the centre, thus: &lt;tt&gt;/|\&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/celt/bim1/bim1033.htm Barddas of Iolo Morganwg, Vol I – The Sacred Symbol]&lt;/ref&gt; This symbol, called "[[awen]]", is often explained as representing the [[sun]].&lt;ref name="gorsethkernow.org.uk"/&gt; The word "awen" means "muse" in Welsh.

A '''Grammy Award''' (stylized as '''GRAMMY''', originally called '''Gramophone Award'''), or '''Grammy''', is an award presented by [[The Recording Academy]] to recognize achievements in the [[music industry]]. The annual presentation ceremony features performances by prominent artists, and the presentation of those awards that have a more popular interest. It shares recognition of the music industry as that of the other performance awards such as the [[Academy Awards]] (film), the [[Emmy Award]]s (television), and the [[Tony Award]]s (theater).

The [[1st Annual Grammy Awards|first Grammy Awards ceremony]] was held on May 4, 1959, to honor and respect the musical accomplishments by performers for the year 1958. Following the 2011 ceremony, [[The Recording Academy|the Academy]] overhauled many Grammy Award categories for 2012.

The [[61st Annual Grammy Awards]], honoring the best achievements from October 1, 2017 to September 30, 2018, will be held on February 10, 2019, at  the [[Staples Center]] in [[Los Angeles]].

==History==
The Grammys had their origin in the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] project in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/about/|title=Hollywood Walk of Fame History|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=May 21, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610020129/http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/about/|archive-date=June 10, 2011|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/pages/history|title=Hollywood Walk of Fame History|publisher=Hollywood Walk of Fame|accessdate=May 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the recording executives chosen for the Walk of Fame committee worked at compiling a list of important recording industry people who might qualify for a Walk of Fame star, they realized there were many more people who were leaders in their business who would never earn a star on [[Hollywood Boulevard]]. The music executives decided to rectify this by creating an award given by their industry similar to the [[Academy Awards|Oscars]] and the [[Emmy Award|Emmys]]. This was the beginning of the [[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]]. After it was decided to create such an award, there was still a question of what to call it; one working title was the Eddie, to honor the inventor of the phonograph, [[Thomas Edison]]. They finally settled on using the name of the invention of [[Emile Berliner]], the [[Phonograph|gramophone]], for the awards, which were first given for the year 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NnRPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5wQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1440,1446700&amp;dq=paul+weston&amp;hl=en|title=Record Academy Plans TV Spectacular of Its Own|author=Thomas, Bob|date=April 8, 1959|publisher=Ocala Star-Banner|accessdate=January 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ca9NAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=cEgDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7065,1739274&amp;dq=paul+weston&amp;hl=en|title=Recording Stars Plan Eddie To Join Oscar And Emmy|date=August 9, 1957|publisher=The Deseret News|accessdate=February 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aSBAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Z1gMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3612,4838071&amp;dq=paul+weston+grammy&amp;hl=en|title=Bronze Stars Begot Grammy|date=February 22, 1976|publisher=The Robesonian|accessdate=May 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1st Annual Grammy Awards|first award ceremony]] was held simultaneously in two locations on May 4, 1959 - Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills California, and Park Sheraton Hotel in New York City,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.awardsandshows.com/features/grammy-awards-1959-may-238.html |title=Grammy Awards 1959 (May) |work=Grammy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 28 Grammys were awarded. The number of awards given grew and fluctuated over the years with categories added and removed, at one time reaching over 100.&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timelines.latimes.com/grammy-awards/ |title=Grammys history and winners through the years|date=January 28, 2015 |work=Los Angeles Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2nd Annual Grammy Awards|second Grammy Awards]], also held in 1959, was the first ceremony to be televised,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.awardsandshows.com/features/grammy-awards-1959-239.html |title=Grammy Awards 1959 |work=Grammy }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the ceremony was not aired live until the [[13th Annual Grammy Awards]] in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.awardsandshows.com/features/grammy-awards-1971-220.html |title=Grammy Awards 1971 |work=Grammy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gramophone trophy==
The gold-plated trophies, each depicting a [[gilded]] [[Phonograph|gramophone]], are made and assembled by hand by Billings Artworks in [[Ridgway, Colorado]]. In 1990 the original Grammy design was revamped, changing the traditional soft lead for a stronger alloy less prone to damage, making the trophy bigger and grander.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.billingsartworks.com/grammy_making.php |title=Making the Grammy |publisher=Billingsartworks.com |year=2006 |accessdate=August 28, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100423143542/http://www.billingsartworks.com/grammy_making.php |archivedate=April 23, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Billings developed a [[zinc]] alloy named grammium, which is trademarked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=And the Grammy Comes From...|last=Williams|first=Nick|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=February 13, 2016|pages=56–57|volume=128|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trophies with the recipient's name engraved on them are not available until after the award announcements, so "stunt" trophies are re-used each year for the broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billingsartworks.com/about.php |title=About Billings Artworks |publisher=Billingsartworks.com |year=2006 |accessdate=August 28, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100423143518/http://www.billingsartworks.com/about.php |archivedate=April 23, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Best|first1=Tamara|title=How the Grammy Awards Are Made: 4 Craftsmen and ‘Grammium’|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/07/arts/music/grammy-award-maker-john-billings.html|website=New York Times|accessdate=February 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By February 2009, a total of 7,578 Grammy trophies had been awarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/News/Default.aspx?newsID=2787&amp;newsCategoryID=1 |title=Neil Portnow's 50th Grammy's Telecast Remarks |publisher=grammy com |date=February 10, 2008 |accessdate=August 28, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221031851/http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/News/Default.aspx?newsID=2787&amp;newsCategoryID=1 |archivedate=February 21, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Categories==
{{main|List of Grammy Award categories}}

The "General Field" are four awards which are not restricted by genre.

* [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]] is awarded to the performer and the production team of a single song if other than the performer.
* [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] is awarded to the performer and the production team of a full album if other than the performer.
* [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]] is awarded to the writer(s)/composer(s) of a single song.
* [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]] is awarded to a promising breakthrough performer who releases, during the Eligibility Year, the first recording that establishes the public identity of that artist (which is not necessarily their first proper release).

The only two artists to win all four of these awards are [[Christopher Cross]], who won all four in 1980, and [[Adele]], who won the Best New Artist award in 2009 and the other three in 2012 and 2017.

Other awards are given for performance and production in specific genres, as well as for other contributions such as artwork and video. Special awards are given for longer-lasting contributions to the music industry.

Because of the large number of award categories (78 in 2012, 81 in 2013 and 82 in 2014), and the desire to feature several performances by various artists, only the ones with the most popular interest - typically about 10 to 12, including the four General Field categories and one or two categories in the most popular music genres (i.e. pop, rock, country, rap) - are presented directly at the televised award ceremony. The many other Grammy trophies are presented in a pre-telecast 'Premiere Ceremony' earlier in the afternoon before the Grammy Awards telecast.

===2012 category restructuring===
{{more citations needed|section|date=May 2017}}

On April 6, 2011, The Recording Academy announced a drastic overhaul of many Grammy Award categories for 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/press-release/apr-06-2011-914-am|title=THE RECORDING ACADEMY® CONTINUES EVOLUTION OF GRAMMY® AWARDS|date=April 6, 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of categories was cut from 109 to 78. The most important change was the elimination of the distinction between male and female soloists and between collaborations and duo/groups in various genre fields (pop, rock, R&amp;B, country, and rap). Also, several categories for instrumental soloists were discontinued. Recordings in these categories now fall under the general categories for best solo performances.

In the [[Rock music|rock]] field, the separate categories for hard rock and metal albums were combined and the [[Best Rock Instrumental Performance]] category was eliminated due to a waning number of entries.

In [[R&amp;B]], the distinction between best contemporary R&amp;B album and other R&amp;B albums has been eliminated. They now feature in one, general [[Best R&amp;B Album]] category.

In [[rap music|rap]], the categories for best rap soloist and best rap duo or group have been merged into the new [[Best Rap Performance]] category.

The most eliminations occurred in the [[American folk music|roots]] category. Up to and including 2011, there were separate categories for various regional American music forms, such as Hawaiian music, Native American music and Zydeco/Cajun music. Due to the consistently low number of entries for these categories, The Recording Academy decided to combine all these music variations into the new [[Best Regional Roots Music Album]], including [[polka]], which lost its own separate category in 2009.&lt;ref name=CBC&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[CBC News]] |title=Grammy board axes polka category to stay 'relevant and responsive' |url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/story/2009/06/04/grammy-changes-polka-ostanek.html?ref=rss |date=June 4, 2009 |accessdate=July 20, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610190520/http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/story/2009/06/04/grammy-changes-polka-ostanek.html?ref=rss |archivedate=June 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT090605"&gt;{{cite news|first=Ben|last=Sisario|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Polka Music Is Eliminated as Grammy Award Category |page=C5 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/05/arts/music/05polk.html|date=June 5, 2009 |accessdate=October 18, 2010 |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same genre field, the traditional and contemporary blues categories and the traditional and contemporary folk categories each were consolidated into one per genre, due to the number of entries and given the challenges in distinguishing between contemporary folk and Americana, and contemporary and traditional blues. In the world music genre field, the traditional and contemporary categories also merged.

In the [[Classical music|classical]] genre field, its main category [[Best Classical Album]] was discontinued because most recipients in this category had also won in one of the other classical categories for the same album. Classical recordings are now eligible for the main [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] category.

There were also a few minor name changes to better reflect the nature of the separate categories. It was determined by the Recording Academy that the word "gospel" in the [[Gospel music|gospel]] genre field tends to conjure up the images and sounds of traditional soul gospel and leaves out the current contemporary Christian music (CCM). Therefore, the genre field and some categories were renamed as Gospel/Contemporary Christian Music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/news/the-academy-continues-evolution-of-grammy-awards-process|title=The Academy Continues Evolution Of GRAMMY Awards Process|date=April 6, 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2012 there have been a small number of adjustments made to the list of categories and genre fields. The number of categories has gone up from 78 in 2012 to 84 in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/news/60th-grammy-awards-full-nominees-list|title=See The Full List Of 60th GRAMMY Nominees|date=2017-11-27|work=GRAMMY.com|access-date=2017-12-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entry process and selection of nominees==
Media companies registered with the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences and individual members of NARAS (artists and other professionals working in the industry who meet certain criteria) may enter recordings for consideration. Entries are made online and a physical copy of the work is sent to NARAS. Once a work is entered, reviewing sessions are held, involving more than 150 experts from the recording industry, to determine whether the work is entered in the correct category.

The resulting lists of eligible entries are circulated to Voting Members, each of whom may vote to nominate in the general fields ([[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]], [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]], [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]], and [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]]) and in no more than nine out of 30 other fields on their ballots. The five recordings that earn the most votes in each category become the nominees, while in some categories (craft and specialized categories) there are review committees in place that determine the final 5 nominees.&lt;ref name="VotingProcess"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/awards/grammy-awards-voting-process | title=Grammy Awards Voting Process | accessdate=January 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There may be more than five nominees if there is a tie in the nomination process.

Whereas members of the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] are generally invited to screenings or are sent DVDs of films nominated for Oscars, NARAS members do not receive nominated recordings. Instead, they receive access to a private online listening function.

==Final voting==
After nominees have been determined, final voting ballots are sent to NARAS voting members, who may then vote in the general fields and in no more than nine of the 30 fields. Members are encouraged, but not required, to vote only in their fields of expertise. Ballots are tabulated secretly by the major independent accounting firm [[Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/Voting/ |title=Grammy Awards Voting Process |publisher=grammy com |accessdate=August 28, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820040650/https://www2.grammy.com/grammy_awards/voting/ |archivedate=August 20, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the tabulation of votes the winners are announced at the Grammy Awards. The recording with the most votes in a category wins and it is possible to have a tie (in which case the two or more nominees who tie are all considered winners). Winners are presented with the Grammy Award and those who do not win are given a medal for their nomination.

In both voting rounds, Academy members are required to vote based upon quality alone, and not to be influenced by sales, chart performance, personal friendships, regional preferences or company loyalty. The acceptance of gifts is prohibited. Members are urged to vote in a manner that preserves the integrity of the Academy and their member community. Although registered media companies may submit entries they may not vote in either round of voting.

The eligibility period for the 60th Annual Grammy Awards was October 1, 2016 to September 30, 2017.

==Grammy Legend==
{{main|Grammy Legend Award}}

A special Grammy Award of merit is awarded intermittently to recognize "ongoing contributions and influence in the recording field".&lt;ref name="Grammy Legend Award"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.grammy.com/Recording_Academy/Awards/Legends/ |title=Grammy Legend Award |publisher=Grammy.com |accessdate=December 20, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101207040854/http://www2.grammy.com/Recording_Academy/Awards/Legends/ |archivedate=December 7, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been called the '''Grammy Legend Award''' and the '''Grammy Living Legend Award''' at different ceremonies.  {{As of|2018|post=,}} only fourteen solo musicians and one band have received this award.

==In Memoriam==

In recent years, the remarks given by the president of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences has been followed by the In Memoriam.

==Venue==
{{main|List of Grammy Award ceremony locations}}
Prior to 1971 the Grammy Award ceremonies were held in different locations on the same day. Originally [[New York City]] and [[Los Angeles]] were the host cities. [[Chicago]] joined being a host city in 1962, and then [[Nashville]] became the fourth location in 1965.

The 1971 ceremony, held at the [[Hollywood Palladium]] in Los Angeles, was the first to take place in one location. The ceremony was then moved to [[Madison Square Garden]]'s [[Felt Forum]] in New York City, and then Nashville's [[Tennessee Theatre (Nashville)|Tennessee Theatre]] in the following two years. Then from 1974 to 2003, the Grammys were held in various venues in New York City and Los Angeles. Notable locations included New York City's Madison Square Garden and [[Radio City Music Hall]]; and Los Angeles's [[Shrine Auditorium]], the [[Staples Center]] and the Hollywood Palladium.

In 2004 the Staples Center became the permanent home of the award ceremonies. [[The Grammy Museum]] was built across the street from Staples Center in [[LA Live]] to preserve the history of the Grammy Awards. Embedded on the sidewalks at the museum streets are bronze disks, similar to the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], honoring each year's top winners, Record of the Year, Best New Artist, Album of the Year, and Song of the Year. During May 2017 it was announced that the 60th Annual Grammy Awards would take place at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City, marking the first time the Grammys have taken place outside of Los Angeles since 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/news/new-york-city-host-2018-grammys|title=When are the 2018 GRAMMYs?|date=9 May 2017|website=Grammy.com|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The awards ceremony forces the [[Los Angeles Kings]], [[Los Angeles Lakers]] and [[Los Angeles Clippers]] to play an extended length of road games.

==Criticism==
The Grammy Awards has received criticism from various recording artists and music journalists.

When [[Pearl Jam]] won a Grammy in the category ''[[Best Hard Rock Performance]]'' in 1996, the band's lead singer [[Eddie Vedder]] commented on stage: "I don't know what this means.

{{quote|I think the Grammys are nothing more than some gigantic promotional machine for the music industry. They cater to a low intellect and they feed the masses.

They have also been criticized for generally awarding or nominating more commercially successful albums rather than critically successful ones.&lt;ref&gt;Deitz, Jason (February 10, 2011).

In 2011, ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' journalist Randall Roberts criticised the exclusion of [[Kanye West]]'s ''[[My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy]]'' from Album of the Year category nominations for the [[54th Grammy Awards]]. He described West's album as "the most critically acclaimed album of the year, a career-defining record".&lt;ref name="Roberts"&gt;{{cite news|last=Roberts|first=Randall|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2011/11/critics-notebook-your-grannys-awards.html|title=Critic's Notebook: Grammy Awards?

{{quote|The major nominations for the 54th annual awards clearly show that the recording academy has been working overtime to be all-inclusive, but more significantly, they also reveal a deep chasm between its goals and the listening habits of the general population... [T]he focus is still on the old music industry model of [[Cash cow|cash-cow]] hits, major label investments and commercial radio...}}

In an article for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', journalist [[Touré (journalist)|Touré]] also responded to the snub and expressed his general displeasure with the awards, stating "I don't pretend to understand the Grammys. I have never been able to discern a consistent logic around who gets nominated or who gets statues. I comprehend the particular logic of the Oscars, but not the big awards for music. My normal state of confusion around what drives Grammy decisions was exponentialized this week when, to the shock of many, Kanye's masterpiece ''My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy'' was not nominated for a Grammy for Album of the Year."&lt;ref name="Touré"/&gt; He went on to compare understanding the Grammy Awards to [[Kremlinology]] and commented on The Recording Academy's exclusion of more "mature" hip hop albums as Album of the Year nominees, noting that it occasionally opts to nominate "pop-friendly" hip hop albums instead.&lt;ref name="Touré"&gt;{{cite news |author=Touré |authorlink=Touré (journalist) |url=http://ideas.time.com/2011/12/02/grammys-fallout-the-subtle-snubbing-of-kanye/ |title=Touré: Why The Grammys Snubbed Kanye West's Twisted Fantasy |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=December 2, 2011 |accessdate=January 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2011 profile for ''[[The New York Times]]'' following the [[53rd Grammy Awards]], frontman [[Justin Vernon]] of indie band [[Bon Iver]] was asked his opinion of the Grammys and how he would react to a nomination for his group, to which he responded:&lt;ref name="Caramanica"&gt;{{cite news |last=Caramanica |first=Jon |url=http://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/02/the-bon-iver-grammy-quandary/ |title=The Bon Iver Grammy Quandary |work=[[The New York Times]] |agency=The 6th Floor |date=December 2, 2011 |accessdate=December 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|You know I was thinking about that a couple of months ago, someone asked me that, and I was like "I would go and I would" – and I don't think the Bon Iver record is the kind of record that would get nominated for a Grammy – "I would get up there and be like, 'This is for my parents, because they supported me,' because I know they would think it would be stupid of me not to go up there. But I kinda felt like going up there and being like: "Everyone should go home, this is ridiculous. You should not be doing this. We should not be gathering in a big room and looking at each other and pretending that this is important." That's what I would say.}}

He reaffirmed this sentiment and commented about the Grammys, saying:&lt;ref name="Caramanica"/&gt;

{{quote|[Ninety-eight]&lt;!-- Changed from "98" because numbers that begin a sentence are spelled out, per [[WP:NUMERAL]]. --&gt; percent of the people in that room, their art is compromised by the fact that they're thinking that, and that they're hoping to get that award. And who is that award given by? It's like they think it's literally handed down by the musical-history gods. And I don't know who the voters are. Like, I have a friend who's a voter who was like, "I had to be a voter because I don't trust the other voters." And I was like, "Me either!" And it's just not important and people spend too much time thinking about it.}}

Bon Iver subsequently received four nominations in November for the 54th Grammy Awards.&lt;ref name="Caramanica"/&gt; After winning the award, Vernon said in his acceptance, "It's really hard to accept this award. There's so much talent out here [...] and there's a lot of talent that's not here tonight. It's also hard to accept because you know, when I started to make songs I did it for the inherent reward of making songs, so I'm a little bit uncomfortable up here."&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;{{cite news |last=Lee |first=Amy |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/13/bon-iver-grammys_n_1272975.html |title=Grammys 2012: Bon Iver Wins Best New Artist, Feels Conflicted About It |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |date=February 13, 2012 |accessdate=February 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his article "Everything Is Praised Again", Jon Caramanica of ''The New York Times'' criticized Grammy voters for being "conservative" and disregarding more "forward-looking" music, and wrote in response to the 54th Grammy Awards, "for the umpteenth time, the Grammys went with familiarity over risk, bestowing album of the year honors (and several more) on an album that reinforced the values of an older generation suspicious of change."&lt;ref name="Caramanica2"/&gt; He cited the Grammy successes of [[Lauryn Hill]]'s ''[[The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill|The Miseducation]]'' (1999), [[Norah Jones]]' ''[[Come Away with Me]]'' (2003), and [[Adele]]'s ''[[21 (Adele album)|21]]'' (2011) as examples of "the Grammys dropp[ing] a boatload of awards on a young female singer-songwriter and her breakthrough album". Of Kanye West's absence from the ceremony, Caramanica stated, "He didn't even bother to show up for the broadcast, which was well enough, because hip-hop was almost completely marginalized".&lt;ref name="Caramanica2"&gt;{{cite news |last=Caramanica |first=Jon |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/14/arts/music/at-the-54th-grammy-awards-everything-old-is-praised-again.html |title=At the 54th Grammy Awards, Everything Old Is Praised Again |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 13, 2012 |accessdate=February 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article for ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', music executive and author [[Steve Stoute]] criticized the Recording Academy and the Grammy Awards for having "lost touch with contemporary popular culture" and noted "two key sources" for it: "(1) over-zealousness to produce a popular show that is at odds with its own system of voting and (2) fundamental disrespect of cultural shifts as being viable and artistic."&lt;ref name="Stoute"&gt;{{cite news |last=Stoute |first=Steve |authorlink=Steve Stoute |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/steve-stoute/steve-stoute-grammys_b_825377.html |title=Steve Stoute: An Open Letter to Neil Portnow, NARAS and the Grammy Awards |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |date=February 20, 2011 |accessdate=February 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stoute accused them of snubbing artists with more cultural impact, citing respective losses by the critical and commercial successes in [[Eminem]]'s ''[[The Marshall Mathers LP]]'' (2000) and Kanye West's ''[[Graduation (album)|Graduation]]'' (2007) in the Album of the Year category, and stated:&lt;ref name="Stoute" /&gt;

{{quote|As an institution that celebrates artistic works of musicians, singers, songwriters, producers and technical specialists, we have come to expect that the Grammys upholds all of the values that reflect the very best in music that is born from our culture. Unfortunately, the awards show has become a series of hypocrisies and contradictions, leaving me to question why any contemporary popular artist would even participate. [...] While there is no doubt in my mind of the artistic talents of [[Steely Dan]] or [[Herbie Hancock]], we must acknowledge the massive cultural impact of Eminem and Kanye West and how their music is shaping, influencing and defining the voice of a generation. It is this same cultural impact that acknowledged the commercial and critical success of [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]'' in 1984.}}

The Grammys' eligibility period – which runs from October 1 to September 30 each year&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = FAQs|url = https://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/awards/voting-process/faqs#two|website = The GRAMMYs|access-date = February 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; – is also a perennial source of complaints and confusion. Because records that are released in the last quarter of a given year are not eligible for that year's awards, fans often think a favorite artist has been snubbed (e.g., Adele, whose ''25'' was released in November 2015 and so was not nominated that year despite massive sales&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Adele Grammys Snub: Why Wasn't She Nominated for 2016 Awards for '25'|url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/adele-grammys-snub-why-wasnt-846425|website = The Hollywood Reporter|access-date = February 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Conversely, the same issue means that the Grammys often recognize work that no longer feels current by the time it wins. Taylor Swift's ''1989'', for example, won Album of the Year in 2016, even though the album was released in October 2014. The same was the case with [[Adele]]’s ''[[25 (Adele album)|25]]''. It was released in November 2015 but received the award in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Truth Behind This Year's Maddening Grammy Nominations|url = https://www.buzzfeed.com/brianmcmanus/the-truth-behind-this-years-maddening-grammy-nominations#.qyONGwObxO|website = BuzzFeed|access-date = February 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Grammys have also been accused of being unfavorable and [[Racism in Grammy Awards|racist]] to black recording artists. Canadian artist [[Drake (musician)|Drake]] accused the awards in a 2017 interview of seeing him only as a rapper and not as a pop-music artist because of his previous work and because of his heritage. He criticized the snubbing of "[[One Dance]]" for the prestigious award of Record of the Year and the nomination of "[[Hotline Bling]]" for [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Song|Best Rap Song]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Performance|Best Rap/Sung Performance]] despite it not being a rap song.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nationofbillions.com/drake-meets-semtex-for-more-talk|title=Drake Meets Semtex For More Talk|newspaper=A Nation of Billions|access-date=February 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Atlantic]]''{{'}}s Spencer Kornhaber accused the Grammys of "sidelining a black visionary work in favor of a white traditionalist one".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Adele, Beyoncé, and the Grammys' Fear of Progress |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/02/adele-beyonce-grammys-album-of-the-year-progress-25-lemonade/516426/ |last=Kornhaber |first=Spencer |website = [[The Atlantic]] |date=February 13, 2017 |access-date=March 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drake did not attend the 2017 Awards Ceremony where he was nominated. He had a performance in Manchester, England on February 12, 2017, the same night as the ceremony. Frank Ocean was vocal about boycotting the same Grammy Awards and did not submit his album for awards consideration as a protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/grammys/7670151/drake-missing-grammys-justin-bieber-kanye-west|title=Drake Won't Be at the Grammy Awards|work=Billboard|access-date=2017-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Grammys have also received criticism for their treatment of female artists. Notably at the 60th Grammy Awards, New Zealand singer [[Lorde]] made media headlines after turning down an offer to perform at the ceremony. She claimed that she was invited to perform alongside several other artists in a tribute to [[Tom Petty]] but was refused a solo slot, despite being nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] Award and stated that each of the male nominees were allowed solo performances. Lorde's mother also criticized the Grammys, pointing out an article which stated that only nine percent of nominees at the previous six Grammy Awards were women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/music/heres-lorde-turned-grammy-performance-2230515|title=Here's why Lorde turned down a Grammy performance - NME|date=January 28, 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the 60th ceremony, many media outlets reported that the ceremony had failed women, specifically pointing to the most nominated female artist [[SZA (singer)|SZA]] who did not win in any of her five nominated categories and to the [[Best Pop Solo Performance]] category which was composed of four female nominees but won by [[Ed Sheeran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefader.com/2018/01/29/grammys-essay-women-artists-2018|title=How the 2018 Grammys failed women artists|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview, [[Neil Portnow]], President of the Recording Academy attracted controversy by stating that female artists need to "step up" in order to win awards. Portnow's comments drew criticism from many female musicians including [[Pink (singer)|Pink]], [[Katy Perry]], [[Vanessa Carlton]], [[Sheryl Crow]], [[Iggy Azalea]], [[Halsey (singer)|Halsey]] and [[Charli XCX]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/30/pink-sheryl-crow-slam-grammys-neil-portnow-women-step-up|title=Pink, Sheryl Crow and more slam Grammys boss for telling women to 'step up'|first=Ben|last=Beaumont-Thomas|date=January 30, 2018|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also prompted the hashtag #GrammysSoMale on social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/5122993/grammys-so-male-reactions/|title=The Internet Is Calling Out the Grammys With #GrammysSoMale|website=Time|language=en|access-date=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==TV broadcasts and ratings==
Prior to the first live Grammys telecast in 1971 on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], a series of filmed annual specials in the 1960s called ''The Best on Record'' were broadcast on [[NBC]]. The first Grammy Award telecast took place on the night of November 29, 1959, as an episode of the NBC anthology series ''[[NBC Sunday Showcase]]'', which was normally devoted to plays, original TV dramas, and variety shows. Until 1971, awards ceremonies were held in both New York and Los Angeles, with winners accepting at one of the two. [[Pierre Cossette]] bought the rights to broadcast the ceremony from the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences and organized the first live telecast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Ken |last=Ehrlich |title=At The Grammys: Behind the Scenes at Music's Biggest Night |publisher=Hal Leonard Books |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-4234-3073-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[CBS]] bought the rights in 1973 after moving the ceremony to [[Nashville]], [[Tennessee]]; the [[American Music Award]]s were created for ABC (by [[Dick Clark]]) as a result.

The Recording Academy announced on June 21, 2011, that it had reached a new deal with CBS to keep the awards show on the network for another 10 years. As part of the new contract the network also could air "nominations concert" special in the last week of November where the nominees are released during the special that is exclusive to CBS, rather than the traditional early-morning press conference with a release of the nominations seen with most major awards ceremonies which any network takes as part of a [[press pool]] (though it was not done in 2017).
Beginning in 2006, the number of viewers was counted in live+SD.&lt;ref name="tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2010/01/28/grammy-awards-tv-ratings/40427/ |title=Grammy Awards TV Ratings Nielsen Ratings - Ratings |publisher=TVbytheNumbers.Zap2it.com |date=January 28, 2010 |accessdate=July 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Grammys are usually held on the second Sunday of February (with the exception of February 14 as that day is [[Valentine's Day]], whenever February 14 falls on a Sunday then the Grammys are held on February 15 as a result) but is held on the last Sunday of January in years where the Winter Olympics take place.

==The Grammys and record sales==
When the televised Grammys came into renown in 1975, a relationship between Grammy Award winners and subsequent [[record sales]] began.&lt;ref name=Watson&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Watson|first1=Mary|title=Award Ceremony as an Arbiter of Commerce and Canon in the Popular Music Industry|journal=Popular Music|date=2006|volume=1|issue=25|pages=41–56|doi=10.1017/S0261143005000747}}&lt;!--|accessdate=July 19, 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Many articles of ''Billboard'' magazine communicate the commercial impact of winning a Grammy—improved record sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hampp|first1=Andrew|title=Grammys Bump More Than Sales|journal=Billboard Magazine|date=2013|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it was not until after 1984 that Grammy recipients' records displayed a substantial increase in sales. This was largely due to an agreement made by NARAS and the National Association of Record Merchandisers (NARM). Under this agreement "record labels provided stickers, posters and other point-of-purchase material emblazoned 'Grammy Nominee' or 'Grammy Award Winner' that retailers could use in order to improve marketing effects."&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt;

[[File:Solomon's Temple, Museum für Hamburgische Geschichte, Hamburg, Germany IMG 5846 edit.jpg|thumb|upright|Detail]]
[[File:Villapando Temple Plan.jpg|upright|thumb|The floor plan of the Hamburg model corresponds to the lack of outdoor gallery from the plan of Juan Bautista Villalpando: : In Ezechielem Explanationes 1604.]]

The '''Hamburg temple model''' is a [[baroque]] architectural model of the [[Solomon's Temple|Temple of Solomon]]. It covers an area of about {{convert|12|m2|sqft}} and is made from wood. It is square, with four wings and nine courtyards, two of them in the central axis.

It was made from 1680 to 1692 after being commissioned by the [[Hamburg]] senator and founder and director of the [[Hamburg Opera]], [[Gerhard Schott]]. The model was first exhibited at the Hamburg Opera. After his death, Schott's heirs put the model up for sale in London, where it was acquired by an agent of [[Augustus II the Strong|Frederick Augustus I]], [[King of Poland]]. In 1732 it was taken to [[Dresden]], where it was shown as part of the collection of [[Jewish ceremonial art]]. After the restructuring of this collection in the early 19th Century the model had several owners, before being acquired by the [[Hamburgmuseum]] in 1910.

Schott's model is in the tradition of many Renaissance and Baroque attempts at reconstruction of the temple by theological and architectural scholars.&lt;!--  considerations examined the original shape of the temple described in the Bible to approach. While most of the experiments were published independently in written or graphic form, is not original bulkhead model.--&gt; The Hamburg-based model closely follows an interpretation by the Spanish Jesuit [[Juan Bautista Villalpando]] in 1604, in turn, based on the [[Third Temple]] described in the [[Book of Ezekiel]].

The reason the expensive and complex model was commissioned is unknown.

Murray Abraham]], and [[Dianne Wiest]]. His most recent programs are "The Real Lincoln-Douglass Debates" with [[Norm Lewis]] and Stephen Lang, performed at The Metropolitan Museum of Art and telecast on C-SPAN; and "Lincoln's Shakespeare" with Waterston, Lang, [[Kathleen Chalfant]], [[Fritz Weaver]], and [[John Douglas Thompson]] and performed in 2013 and 2014 at [[The Century Association]] and The Berkshire Playhouse. Holzer's programs have been staged at such venues as the [[White House]], the George H. W. Bush Presidential Library, the [[William J. Clinton Presidential Library]], [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts|Lincoln Center]] in New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, the [[Library of Congress]], the Lincoln Association of Los Angeles, [http://www.thelincolnforum.org/ The Lincoln Forum at Gettysburg], [[Ford's Theatre]], site of the Lincoln assassination, and the [[U.S. Capitol]].

Before joining the Metropolitan Museum in 1992, Holzer was special counselor to the New York State economic development director in the administration of the late Governor [[Mario Cuomo|Mario M. Cuomo]] (with whom he co-edited the 1990 book, ''Lincoln on Democracy'', which has now been translated into four languages). Before that, he was director of communications at [http://www.wnet.org/ WNET/Channel 13], the flagship PBS station in New York, and in the 1970s, served as a political press secretary—first to the late Rep. [[Bella Abzug|Bella S. Abzug (D-NY)]] in Congress and in her campaigns for the U. S. Senate and Mayor of New York; and in the 1977 general election mayoral campaign of Mr. Cuomo. Holzer started his career as a reporter, later editor, for the onetime news weekly the ''Manhattan Tribune''.

In 2008, Holzer received the [[National Humanities Medal]] from President Bush and The Lincoln Medal of Honor from the Lincoln Society of [[Springfield, Illinois]], the state's highest honor. He also won a second-place 2005 Lincoln Prize (for ''Lincoln at Cooper Union'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gettysburg.edu/civilwar/prizes_andscholarships/lincoln_prize/previous_winners.dot|title=Gettysburg College: 404 page not found|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his 2008 book ''Lincoln President-Elect'', Holzer received awards from The Lincoln Group of New York, The Civil War Round Table of New York, and The Illinois State Historical Society. His young readers' book, ''Father Abraham: Lincoln and His Sons'', won the first James Robertson Jr. Award for Civil War Children's Literature from The Civil War Round Table of New York. He has also won lifetime achievement awards from The Civil War Round Tables of New York, Chicago, and Kansas City, and from Lincoln groups in Washington and New York. He won the DAR History Award Medal in 2012. In 2013, he wrote the Lincoln-Emancipation essay for the official program for the re-inauguration of President [[Barack Obama]]. In addition to the [[Lincoln Prize]] for ''[[Lincoln and the Power of the Press: The War for Public Opinion]]'', the book also won the [[Mark Lynton History Prize]] from the [[Columbia University School of Journalism]], the Goldsmith Book Prize from [[The Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics, and Public Policy]] at Harvard's Kennedy School, and The Hazel Dicken-Garcia Award for Distinguished Scholarship in Journalism History.

An '''iconograph''' is a picture formed by a word or words. It can take the form of irregularly shaped letters or (especially in the case of poems) irregularly aligned text.

[[United States|American]] poet [[May Swenson]] popularized such poems in her 1970 book ''Iconographs'', which contained a number of poems laid out to resemble their subjects (e.g. a [[butterfly]]).

'''''Is Paris Burning?''''' Is a 1965 book by [[Larry Collins (writer)|Larry Collins]] and [[Dominique Lapierre]] telling the story of the [[Liberation of Paris]] during the [[Second World War]].
The book examines the military and political actions surrounding the events of late August 1944 around Paris and how these events unfolded.
The title is taken from the question reportedly asked by [[Adolf Hitler]] following his order to destroy the city rather than let it be re-captured by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. 
The story was adapted into a feature film [[Is Paris Burning? (film)|by the same name]] in 1966.

==Layout==
The book is laid out in three parts; 

Part 1, "The Menace", examines the military and political situation at the beginning of August 1944, and the considerations of the various parties involved. 

Part 2, "The Struggle", is a day-by-day account of the actions between 19 August, when the uprising by the [[French Resistance]] in the city commenced, and 25 August, when the [[325th Security Division (Wehrmacht)|German garrison]] surrendered.

Part 3, "The Deliverance", describes the activities of 26 and 27 August, detailing particularly the consolidation by General de Gaulle of his position as leader of the [[Provisional Government of the French Republic|liberated French state]].

==Style==
The book is written as a series of [[Vignette (literature)|vignettes]] based on interviews with, and the written memoirs of, the people involved, on all sides, in the liberation of Paris. 

These include members of the various factions of the French Resistance, and of the [[Free France|Free French Forces]] and citizens of Paris;  members of the [[United States Armed Forces|American Armed Forces]];  and members of the occupying [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]].

Researchers spent nearly three years locating survivors of the Liberation of Paris, and undertook over 800 interviews of persons in France, Germany and the United States. They also had access to Allied and German action reports, war diaries, memoirs, and official records. 

Senior Allied officers who assisted the authors included Generals [[Dwight D Eisenhower]] and [[Omar Bradley]], and [[Allen Dulles]] (of the [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]]); French interviewees included [[Jacques Chaban-Delmas]] and [[Henri Rol-Tanguy]] (of the French Resistance), Mme Leclerc (widow of [[Jacques Leclerc]]) and [[Alain de Boissieu]] (son-in-law of [[Charles de Gaulle]]); and from Germany, [[Dietrich von Choltitz]] (Commandant of the Paris garrison) and [[Walter Warlimont]] (of the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|German High Command]]).

'''Joya de Cerén''' (''Jewel of Cerén'' in the [[Spanish language]]) is an [[archaeological site]] in [[La Libertad Department, El Salvador|La Libertad Department]], [[El Salvador]], featuring a [[pre-Columbian]] [[Maya civilization|Maya]] farming village.
The ancient Maya site of Joya de Cerén is located in the Zapotitán Valley 36,000 meters northwest of [[San Salvador]], El Salvador.&lt;ref&gt;Castellanos, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; It is often referred to as the "[[Pompeii]] of the [[Americas]]", in comparison to the famed Ancient Roman ruins. This site is known for the excellent preservation of a [[Classic period]] settlement that was rapidly buried by the ashfall of an eruption of the Loma Caldera around A.D. 600.&lt;ref&gt;Conyers, pp. 377-378.&lt;/ref&gt; The relative abundance of [[Paleoethnobotany|paleoethnobotanical]] remains recovered at Joya de Cerén in comparison to other ancient Maya archaeological sites make Joya de Cerén particularly significant in the study of everyday life of ancient Maya agricultural communities. Of importance was the discovery of a [[manioc]] field, the first instance of manioc cultivation identified at a [[New World]] archaeological site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://artsandsciences.colorado.edu/magazine/2009/06/cu-team-discovers-mayan-crop-system/ CU team discovers Mayan crop system.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715185525/http://artsandsciences.colorado.edu/magazine/2009/06/cu-team-discovers-mayan-crop-system/|date=2015-07-15}} University of Colorado at Boulder, June 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The site was thought to have been settled between A.D. 200 and A.D. 600.&lt;ref&gt;Castellanos, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Joya de Cerén was entered on the [[UNESCO World Heritage List]] in 1993 and is a major tourist attraction in El Salvador.&lt;ref&gt;Castellanos, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Abandonment of Joya de Cerén ==
1,400 years before the village was abandoned, the population was estimated to be 200 people.&lt;ref&gt;Sheets 2013, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; The eruption of the [[Loma Caldera|Loma Caldera volcano]] caused 10 meters of pyroclastic debris to settle over the site.&lt;ref&gt;Conyers, p. 377.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lentz et al.&lt;/ref&gt; The site was remarkably well preserved due to the low temperature of ash and very fast ashfall, a 4 - 8 meter thick layer having blanketed the town in the space of a few hours. The use of plaster casting by archaeologists similar to the one used in [[Pompeii]] assisted in their identification of fruiting plants, abundance of beans in storage, and mature [[maize]] to predict the eruption happened in August or September.&lt;ref&gt;Conyers, p. 377; Brown and Sheets, p. 11; Farahani, p. 982&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guava]], [[agave]], [[Theobroma cacao|cacao]], and manioc were some of the major crops to the community.&lt;ref&gt;Conyers, p. 383; Farahani, p. 994&lt;/ref&gt; Based on crack patterns observed from the relatively earthquake-resistant wattle-and-daub walls and adobe columns at Joya de Cerén, scholars suggest that an earthquake measuring 4.0 on the [[Richter scale]] preceded the eruption, giving residents time to flee the site.&lt;ref&gt;Brown and Sheets, p. 11; Sheets 2013; p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Further, possible steamy emissions from the volcano may have alerted residents of the impending danger, but only inferences can be made about what exactly warned them.&lt;ref&gt;Brown and Sheets, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear to scholars if the duration of the eruptions lasted a few days or a few weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1989&lt;/ref&gt; 
The position of artifacts at the site have lead scholars to suggest that the evacuation of Joya de Cerén happened in the early evening: shovels and other agricultural work equipment were found stored near the domestic structures, and fires had been lit in [[hearths]]. &lt;ref&gt;Sheets 1992; Conyers, p. 388&lt;/ref&gt; Also, sleeping mats had not yet been rolled out on the domicile floor. &lt;ref&gt;Conyers, p. 389&lt;/ref&gt; No human remains have been discovered at the ancient Maya site.&lt;ref&gt;Sheets 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Plaza==
Joya de Cerén can be divided into a northeastern area, a southeastern area, and northwestern area.&lt;ref&gt;Sheets 2013, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; The northwestern area holds Household 1 alongside Structure 1, 5-6, 10-12, 17 containing milpas and a kitchen garden. The southeastern area holds Household 2 alongside Structure 2, 7, 9, 13, 18 containing a [[Temazcal|temascal]], milpas and a basurero (trash pit). The northwestern area holds Household 3-4 alongside Structure 3-4, 8, 14-16 containing [[milpa]]s, fruit trees, and another basurero.&lt;ref&gt;Sheets 2013, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; 18 structures have been identified in archaeological survey. Of these, ten have been excavated by archaeologists. &lt;ref&gt;Castellanos, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars distinguish ceremonial buildings from non-ceremonial buildings with the following considerations: orientation of building, platform heights, floor plans, assemblages, construction technique, [[altar]]s, [[Hoard|caches]], burials, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Brown and Sheets, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Plan of Joya de Cerén.jpg|thumb|The Plaza of Cerén in El Salvador]]

===Structure 10===
Structure 10 is a multi-roomed structure with many corridors.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Brown and Sheets 2000; Parnell et al. 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologists interpret Structure 10 as being used for community festivals in the Classic Maya period, based on features associated with ceremonial activities.&lt;ref&gt;Brown and Sheets, pp. 13-14&lt;/ref&gt; Inside Structure 10 was a north corridor for food preparation, while the east corridor stored several vessels.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Brown and Sheets, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, decorated vessels and a red painted deer and twine headdress was recovered in Structure 10, which has been interpreted by archaeologists as connected with fertility and harvest rituals&lt;ref&gt;Parnell et al. 339&lt;/ref&gt;. Vessels filled with achiote seeds, found in associated with ceremonial objects suggest that the eruption may have interrupted a ceremony&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Additionally, archaeologists propose that a north corridor for used for food preparation, while the east corridor may have been used for storage.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Structure 12===
Structure 12 is located 5 meters away from Structure 10 and was defined by a doorway and two lattice windows that directed and restricted traffic inside the structure.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Brown and Sheets, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly to Structure 10, archaeologists believe Structure 12 was also associated with the performance of religious activities&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. The storage of miscellaneous female-associated artifacts discovered in the niche of an earthen bench may have been a part of a woman’s supernatural tool kit&lt;ref&gt;Brown and Sheets, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;. The tool kit of ceramic figurines, shell fragments, beans, and antlers has led scholars to infer the building was for the diviner to hold divinatory activities in the back rooms and through a window of the west room.&lt;ref&gt;Brown and Sheets, p. 14-15&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structure 1===
Structure 1 is also known as Household 1 in archaeological literature, and has been fully excavated.&lt;ref&gt;Sheets 2000, p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologists propose a service relationship between 1 and Structure 10 and Structure 12 because the kitchen of 1 presumably was used for masa production with their supply of metates for ceremonies inside Structures 10 and 12.&lt;ref&gt;Brown and Sheets, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; The difference in hearths based on amount of wear was an indicator to scholars to identify if the building was for ritualistic activities or not.&lt;ref&gt;Brown and Sheets, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of phosphorus detection and heavy metal extraction within the site have allowed archaeologists to discover that each household stored about 70 vessels for cooking, plus serving food and drinks conducted in kitchen and midden areas in comparison to other areas.&lt;ref&gt;Parnell, pp.331-332; Brown and Sheets, p. 13; Sheets 2013, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economy ==
The community of Cerén locally produced agave fibers, manos, and metates, and pottery vessels, while acquiring imports such as cutting tools made from [[obsidian]] and [[chert]], [[jade]] from the north ([[Sierra de las Minas]]), or fancy pottery from [[Copán]] presumably from elite-managed markets outside.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler, p. 637; Sheets, pp.220-222&lt;/ref&gt; Once households owned these commodities, they often participated in horizontal exchanges with other households in the village or places nearby in the case of a surplus.&lt;ref&gt;Sheets, p. 227&lt;/ref&gt; The orientation of the households in the village and the assemblages found in each one helped scholars determine that the building was used for non-ceremonial purposes, rather than ceremonial purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Brown and Sheets 16; Parnell et al. 333&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discovery ==
The site was discovered in 1976 by a bulldozer driver leveling ground for a government agricultural project. The first structures dug up were Structure 10 and 12 that were part of the northeastern area of the village. It was explored in depth by [[Payson D. Sheets|Payson Sheets]], a professor of [[anthropology]] at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]], in 1978 and 1980. Excavation resumed in 1988, and has been continuous since then. Approximately 70 buildings have been uncovered so far, including storehouses, kitchens, living quarters, workshops, a religious structure, and a communal sauna.&lt;ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5478">[[File:Kafkania pebble.jpg|thumb|The front and rear views of the stone.]]The '''Kafkania pebble''' is a small rounded river pebble about {{convert|5|cm|in}} long, with [[Linear B]] symbols and a [[double axe]] symbol inscribed on it. It was found in Kafkania, some {{convert|7|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], on 1 April 1994 in a 17th-century BC [[archaeological context]]. If it were genuine, it would be the earliest writing on the Greek mainland, and by far the earliest document in Linear B. However, it is in all probability a modern [[forgery]] and a [[hoax]].

==Inscription==
The pebble bears a short inscription of eight syllabic signs in [[Linear B]], possibly reading ''{{lang|gmy-Latn|a-so-na / qo-ro-qa / qa-jo}}''. The reverse side shows a [[double axe|double-axe]] symbol. The inscription is identified by some{{who|date=February 2011}} to be in [[Mycenean Greek]], but that identification remains disputed. It has been suggested that such an isolated example of Linear B script indicates, at best, an early stage of Mycenaean writing at the time of origin.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?ei=eGCKTe6fOJSN4gaDwf38DQ&amp;ct=result&amp;hl=el&amp;id=008nAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Kafkanian%2Bmycenaean&amp;q=%22such+an+isolated+example+%28without+logograms+or+numbers%29+could+indicate+at+best+only+an+early+stage+of+Mycenaean+writing%22 Floreant studia Mycenaea]. p. 557&lt;/ref&gt;

G. Owens suggests that the inscription is Minoan in origin rather than Mycenaean. Then, a [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] could have written the text for a [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]]. No evidence exists that the Mycenaean Greeks wrote before the Linear B archive of Knossos.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teicrete.gr/Daidalika/minoan_or_mycenaean.pdf Gareth Owens, Simon Benett, Minoan Inscriptions in Mycenaean Greece, DO-SO-MO: Fascicula Mycenologica Polona p52-69, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forgery==

Several specialists in Mycenaean epigraphy have expressed serious doubts about the authenticity of the inscription; indications that it is a modern forgery include:&lt;ref name="palaima"&gt;[[Thomas G. Palaima]], "OL Zh 1: ''QVOVSQVE TANDEM?''" ''Minos'' '''37-38''' (2002-2003), p. 373-85 [http://www.utexas.edu/research/pasp/publications/pdf/kafkania.pdf full text]

Younger, ''review'' of Yves Duhoux and [[Anna Morpurgo Davies]], ''A Companion to Linear B: Mycenaean Greek Texts and their World'', '''1''' in ''American Journal of Archaeology Online Book Review'', '''113'''.4 (October 2009) [http://www.ajaonline.org/sites/default/files/07_Younger.pdf full text]

J. Driessen, "Chronology of the Linear B Texts" in Yves Duhoux, Anna Morpurgo Davies, eds., ''A Companion to Linear B: Mycenaean Greek Texts and their World'', '''1''':76 (2008) [https://uclouvain.academia.edu/JanDriessen/Papers/364538/Chronology_of_Linear_B_Documents full text] "This pebble remains something of an enigma since neither its date, nor its context, nor its nature can be easily fitted into a general historical framework; hence I remain sceptical and await further discoveries."
&lt;/ref&gt;

* Inscriptions on pebbles are otherwise unknown in Mycenaean and Minoan epigraphy.
* The "rays" surrounding the axe have no parallels in Myceanaean or Minoan iconography.
* Most of the symbols are "carefully executed" but one appears to be a "random graffito".&lt;ref name="palaima"/&gt;
* Its context, imbedded in a wall, is peculiar and unprecedented.
* Linear B is otherwise consistently written left-to-right, but the inscription is apparently written in [[boustrophedon]].
* The [[palaeography|writing style]] appears anachronistic.
* It is unlikely on historical grounds that Linear B writing then existed in the northwest Peloponnese.
* Finally, the pebble was apparently discovered on the morning of [[April Fool's Day]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=jXxiAAAAMAAJ ''Minos'': 2003, p. 489]; ''Meletemata: Studies in Aegean archaeology presented to Malcolm H.

Actes de la 7e Rencontre égéenne internationale, Université de Liège, 14-17 avril 1998'', 1999, p. 400].&lt;/ref&gt; If it is indeed a forgery, the symbols spelling ''a-so-na'' may spell out the name ''Iasonas'', the first name of the son of Xeni Arapojanni and Jörg Rambach, the alleged discoverers of the pebble.&lt;ref name="palaima"/&gt;

'''Kanas Lake''' ({{zh|c=喀纳斯湖|p=Kānàsī Hú}}, {{lang-ug|ug=قاناس كۆلى|lat=Qanas köli|yengi=Ⱪanas köli}}, Қанас Көли, [[Xiao'erjing]]: كَانَاسِ خٗ) is a lake in [[Altay Prefecture]], [[Xinjiang]], [[China]]. The lake is located in a valley in the [[Altai Mountains]], near the very northern tip of [[Xinjiang]], and the province's borders with Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and Russia. The lake was formed around 200,000 years ago during the [[Quaternary]] period as a result of glacier movement. The crescent moon shaped lake has an estimated water storage capacity of 53.8 billion cubic meters, coupled with an average depth of around 120 meters.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.silk-road-china.com/hanas.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kanas River]], flowing out of the lake, later merges with the [[Hemu River]] to form the [[Burqin River]], which itself discharges into the [[Irtysh River]] at Burqin Town, the county seat of [[Burqin County]].

There is a large population of ethnic [[Tuvans]] and [[Kazakhs]] in the Kanas valley. While most of these people have maintained their traditional [[agricultural]] and [[nomadic]] life styles, many work in the developing tourism industry, and have established facilities for [[orienteering]], [[hiking]], [[rafting]], [[rock climbing]], [[paragliding]] and [[camping]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.china.com.cn/travel/txt/2009-03/12/content_17427946_4.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://outdoor.lotour.com/x/20080424/n306090.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; The ''scenic spot'' is classified as a [[AAAAA scenic area]] by the [[China National Tourism Administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.cnta.gov.cn/html/2008-11/2008-11-16-10-27-72978.html |date=16 November 2008 |title=AAAAA Scenic Areas |work=[[China National Tourism Administration]] |accessdate=9 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140404043021/http://en.cnta.gov.cn/html/2008-11/2008-11-16-10-27-72978.html |archivedate= 4 April 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 117 different kinds of birds live along the lake.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

== Lake creatures ==

For several centuries there have been sightings of large lake creatures in the waters. First efforts in research of these legends were done by Yuan Guoying ([[Xinjiang University]]) who observed fish of enormous size in 1985. He and his students assessed that the fish could be 10 – 15 m long and more than 4 tons heavy, with total population in excess of 50 individuals.

Frequency of observation has increased in the 21st century, with the development of mass tourism. A video was taken and shown in the local Chinese media where numerous unidentifiable creatures can be seen.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgaihUBaTIM YouTube: Unknown creature in Kanas Lake]&lt;/ref&gt;
According to CCTV10, the creatures living in the lake are speculated by Chinese scholar as giant ''[[Hucho taimen]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XMTkwNDU2MDg=.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lothal''' ({{IPA-all|loˑt̪ʰəl}}) is one of the southernmost cities of the ancient [[Indus Valley Civilization]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cntraveller.in/story/india-via-gujarat/|title=Where does history begin?}}&lt;/ref&gt; located in the [[Bhal region|Bhāl region]] (Ahammedabad District, Dholka Taluk)of the modern state of [[Gujarat|Gujarāt]] and first inhabited {{circa}} 3700&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/indus-river-re-enters-india/1/158976.html |title=Indus re-enters India after two centuries, feeds Little Rann, Nal Sarovar |publisher=India Today|date=7 November 2011 |accessdate=7 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; .The meaning of the word Lothal is "the mount of the dead" exactly same as that of Mohenjodaro another famous site of Indus Valley civilization. Discovered in 1954, Lothal was excavated from 13 February 1955 to 19 May 1960 by the [[Archaeological Survey of India]] (ASI), the official Indian government agency for the preservation of ancient monuments. According to the ASI, Lothal had the world's earliest known [[dock (maritime)|dock]], which connected the city to an ancient course of the [[Sabarmati]] river on the [[trade route]] between [[Harappa]]n cities in [[Sindh]] and the peninsula of [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]] when the surrounding [[Kutch]] desert of today was a part of the [[Arabian Sea]]. However, this interpretation has been challenged by other [[archaeologist]]s, who argue that Lothal was a comparatively small town, and that the "dock" was actually an [[irrigation tank]].&lt;ref&gt;Leshnik, "The Harappan 'Port' at Lothal"&lt;/ref&gt;

Lothal was a vital and thriving trade centre in ancient times, with its trade of [[bead]]s, [[gemstone|gems]] and valuable ornaments reaching the far corners of West Asia and Africa. The techniques and tools they pioneered for bead-making and in [[metallurgy]] have stood the test of time for over 4000&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://asi.nic.in/asi_exca_imp_gujarat.asp|title=Excavations – Important – Gujarat|date=|work=|publisher=Archaeological Survey of India|accessdate=25 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lothal is situated near the village of [[Saragwala]] in the [[Dholka Taluka]] of [[Ahmedabad district]]. It is six kilometres south-east of the Lothal-[[Bhurkhi]] railway station on the [[Ahmedabad]]-[[Bhavnagar]] railway line. It is also connected by all-weather roads to the cities of Ahmedabad (85&amp;nbsp;km/53&amp;nbsp;mi), Bhavnagar, [[Rajkot]] and [[Dholka]]. The nearest cities are Dholka and [[Bagodara]]. Resuming excavation in 1961, archaeologists unearthed trenches sunk on the northern, eastern and western flanks of the mound, bringing to light the inlet channels and ''nullah'' ("ravine", or "gully") connecting the dock with the river. The findings consist of a [[mound]], a township, a [[marketplace]], and the dock. Adjacent to the excavated areas stands the Archaeological Museum, where some of the most prominent collections of Indus-era antiquities in India are displayed.

The Lothal site has been nominated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and its application is pending on the tentative list of UNESCO.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5918/ http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5918/], UNESCO&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeology==
[[File:IVC Map.png|thumb|left|300px|Extent and major sites of the [[Indus Valley Civilization]].]]

When [[Partition of India|British India was partitioned]] in 1947, most Indus sites, including [[Mohenjo-daro]] and [[Harappa]], became part of [[Pakistan]]. The Archaeological Survey of India undertook a new program of exploration, and excavation. Many sites were discovered across northwestern India. Between 1954 and 1958, more than 50 sites were excavated in the [[Kutch]] (notably [[Dholavira]]), and [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]] peninsulas, extending the limits of [[Harappan civilisation]] by {{convert|500|km|mi|abbr=off}} to the river Kim, where the [[Bhagatrav]] site accesses the valley of the rivers [[Narmada River|Narmada]] and [[Tapti]]. Lothal stands {{convert|670|km|mi|abbr=off|sp=us}} from [[Mohenjo-daro]], which is in [[Sindh]].&lt;ref name="Fam5"&gt;{{cite book

S.R.Rao lead the excavation.The meaning of Lothal (a combination of ''Loth'' and ''(s) thal'') in [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] to be "the mound of the dead" is not unusual, as the name of the city of [[Mohenjo-daro]] in [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]] means the same. People in villages neighbouring to Lothal had known of the presence of an ancient town and human remains. As recently as 1850, boats could sail up to the mound. In 1942, timber was shipped from [[Bharuch|Broach]] to Saragwala via the mound. A silted creek connecting modern Bholad with Lothal and Saragwala represents the ancient flow channel of a river or creek.&lt;ref name="Rao1"&gt;{{cite book
| title = Lothal
| publisher = [[Archaeological Survey of India]]
| author = [[S. R. Rao]]
| pages = 2–3
| year = 1985
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speculation suggests that owing to the comparatively small dimensions of the main city, Lothal was not a large settlement at all, and its "dock" was perhaps an irrigation tank.&lt;ref name = "JSTOR"/&gt; However, the ASI and other contemporary archaeologists assert that the city was a part of a major river system on the trade route of the ancient peoples from Sindh to [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]] in Gujarat. Lothal provides with the largest collection of antiquities in the archaeology of modern India.&lt;ref name="Rao2"&gt;{{cite book
| title = Lothal
| publisher = [[Archaeological Survey of India]]
| author = [[S. R. Rao]]
| pages = 30–31
| year = 1985
}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is essentially a single culture site—the Harappan culture in all its variances is evidenced.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} An indigenous [[micaceous]] Red Ware culture also existed, which is believed to be{{who|date=May 2015}} [[indigenous peoples|autochthonous]] and pre-Harappan.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Two sub-periods of Harappan culture are distinguished: the same period (between 2400 and 1900&amp;nbsp;BCE) is identical to the exuberant culture of [[Harappa]] and [[Mohenjo-daro]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

[[File:Gujarat Gulfs.jpg|thumb|300px|To the northwest of Lothal lies the [[Kutch]] (see also [[Dholavira]]) peninsula, which was a part of the [[Arabian Sea]] until very recently in history. Owing to this, and the proximity of the [[Gulf of Khambhat]], Lothal's river provided direct access to sea routes. Although now sealed off from the sea, Lothal's topography and geology reflects its maritime past.]]

After the core of the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus]] civilisation had decayed in [[Mohenjo-daro]] and [[Harappa]], Lothal seems not only to have survived but to have thrived for many years. Its constant threats - tropical storms and floods - caused immense destruction, which destabilised the culture and ultimately caused its end. [[Topography|Topographical analysis]] also shows signs that at about the time of its demise, the region suffered from [[aridity]] or weakened [[monsoon]] rainfall. Thus the cause for the abandonment of the city may have been changes in the [[climate]] as well as natural disasters, as suggested by environmental magnetic records.&lt;ref name = "PDF"/&gt; Lothal is based upon a mound that was a [[salt marsh]] inundated by tide. Remote sensing and topographical studies published by Indian scientists in the ''Journal of the Indian Geophysicists Union'' in 2004 revealed an ancient, meandering river adjacent to Lothal, {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=off}} in length according to [[satellite imagery]]— an ancient extension of the northern river channel bed of a tributary of the Bhogavo river. Small channel widths ({{convert|10|–|300|m|ft|abbr=on| disp=or}}) when compared to the lower reaches ({{convert|1.2|–|1.6|km|mi|abbr=on| disp=or}}) suggest the presence of a strong tidal influence upon the city—tidal waters ingressed up to and beyond the city. Upstream elements of this river provided a suitable source of [[freshwater]] for the inhabitants.&lt;ref name="PDF"&gt;{{cite web

===Town planning===
A flood destroyed village foundations and settlements (c. 2350&amp;nbsp;BCE). Harappans based around Lothal and from Sindh took this opportunity to expand their settlement and create a planned township on the lines of greater cities in the Indus valley.&lt;ref name="Rao10"&gt;{{cite book
| title = Lothal
| publisher = [[Archaeological Survey of India]]
| author = [[S. R. Rao]]
| page = 6
| year = 1985
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lothal planners engaged themselves to protect the area from consistent floods. The town was divided into blocks of 1–2-metre-high (3–6&amp;nbsp;ft) platforms of sun-dried bricks, each serving 20–30 houses of thick mud and brick walls. The city was divided into a [[citadel]], or [[acropolis]] and a lower town. The rulers of the town lived in the acropolis, which featured paved [[public bathing|baths]], underground and surface drains (built of kiln-fired bricks) and a potable water well. The lower town was subdivided into two sectors. A north-south arterial street was the main commercial area. It was flanked by shops of rich and ordinary merchants and craftsmen. The residential area was located to either side of the marketplace. The lower town was also periodically enlarged during Lothal's years of prosperity.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Lothal engineers accorded high priority to the creation of a [[dockyard]] and a [[warehouse]] to serve the purposes of naval trade. While the consensus view amongst archaeologists identifies this structure as a "dockyard," it has also been suggested that owing to small dimensions, this basin may have been an irrigation tank and canal.&lt;ref name = "JSTOR"/&gt; The dock was built on the eastern flank of the town, and is regarded by archaeologists as an engineering feat of the highest order. It was located away from the main current of the river to avoid [[silting]], but provided access to ships in high tide as well. The warehouse was built close to the acropolis on a 3.5-metre-high (10.5&amp;nbsp;ft) podium of mud bricks. The rulers could thus supervise the activity on the dock and warehouse simultaneously. Facilitating the movement of cargo was a [[mudbrick]] [[wharf]], {{convert|220|m|ft|abbr=off}} long, built on the western arm of the dock, with a ramp leading to the warehouse.&lt;ref name="Rao5A"&gt;{{cite book
| title = Lothal
| publisher = [[Archaeological Survey of India]]
| author = [[S. R. Rao]]
| pages = 7–8
| year = 1985
}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was an important public building opposite to the warehouse whose superstructure has completely disappeared. Throughout their time, the city had to brace itself through multiple floods and storms. Dock and city peripheral walls were maintained efficiently. The town's zealous rebuilding ensured the growth and prosperity of the trade. However, with rising prosperity, Lothal's people failed to upkeep their walls and dock facilities, possibly as a result of over-confidence in their systems. A flood of moderate intensity in 2050&amp;nbsp;BCE exposed some serious weaknesses in the structure, but the problems were not addressed properly.&lt;ref name="RaoY"/&gt;
All the construction were made of fire dried bricks, lime and sand mortar and not by sun dried bricks as bricks are still intact after 4000 years and still bonded together with each other with the mortar bond.&lt;ref&gt;http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/78538322.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economy and urban culture===
[[File:Lothal - ancient well.jpg|thumb|An ancient well, and the city drainage canals]]
The uniform organisation of the town and its institutions give evidence that the Harappans were very disciplined people.&lt;ref name="Rao1A"&gt;{{cite book
| title = Lothal
| publisher = [[Archaeological Survey of India]]
| author = [[S. R. Rao]]

| year = 1985
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commerce and administrative duties were performed according to standards laid out. Municipal administration was strict – the width of most streets remained the same over a long time, and no encroached structures were built. Householders possessed a [[sump]], or collection chamber to deposit solid waste in order to prevent the clogging of city drains. Drains, manholes and cesspools kept the city clean and deposited the waste in the river, which was washed out during high tide. A new provincial style of Harappan art and painting was pioneered. The new approaches included realistic portrayals of animals in their natural surroundings. Metalware, gold and jewellery and tastefully decorated ornaments attest to the culture and prosperity of the people of Lothal.

Most of their equipment: metal tools, weights, measures, seals, earthenware and ornaments were of the uniform standard and quality found across the Indus civilization. Lothal was a major trade centre, importing ''en masse'' raw materials like copper, [[chert]] and semi-precious stones from [[Mohenjo-daro]] and [[Harappa]], and mass distributing to inner villages and towns. It also produced large quantities of bronze [[celt (tool)|celts]], fish-hooks, chisels, spears and ornaments. Lothal exported its beads, gemstones, ivory and shells. The stone blade industry catered to domestic needs—fine chert was imported from the [[Larkana]] valley or from [[Bijapur, Karnataka|Bijapur]] in modern [[Karnataka]]. [[Bhagatrav]] supplied semi-precious stones while ''chank'' shell came from [[Dholavira]] and [[Bet Dwarka]]. An intensive trade network gave the inhabitants great prosperity. The network stretched across the frontiers to [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], Bahrain and [[Sumer]].&lt;ref name="RaoY"/&gt; One of the evidence of trade in Lothal is the discovery of typical Persian gulf seals, a circular button seal&lt;ref&gt;[[Bridget Allchin|Bridget]], [[F. Raymond Allchin]], ''The rise of civilization in India and Pakistan'', p.&amp;nbsp;187&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architectural development===
[[File:Lothal - bathroom structure.jpg|thumb|The bathroom-toilet structure of houses in Lothal]]
While the wider debate over the end of [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus civilisation]] continues, archaeological evidence gathered by the ASI appears to point to natural catastrophes, specifically floods and storms as the source of Lothal's downfall. A powerful flood submerged the town and destroyed most of the houses, with the walls and platforms heavily damaged. The acropolis was levelled (2000–1900&amp;nbsp;BCE), and inhabited by common tradesmen and newly built makeshift houses. The worst consequence was the shift in the course of the river, cutting off access to the ships and dock.&lt;ref name="Rao12"&gt;{{cite book
| title = Lothal
| publisher = [[Archaeological Survey of India]]
| author = [[S. R. Rao]]
| page = 12
| year = 1985
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The people built a new but shallow inlet to connect the flow channel to the dock for sluicing small ships into the basin. Large ships were moored away. Houses were rebuilt, yet without removal of flood debris, which made them poor-quality and susceptible to further damage. Public drains were replaced by soakage jars. The citizens did not undertake encroachments, and rebuilt public baths. However, with a poorly organised government, and no outside agency or central government, the public works could not be properly repaired or maintained. The heavily damaged warehouse was never repaired properly, and stocks were stored in wooden canopies, exposed to floods and fire. The economy of the city was transformed. Trade volumes reduced greatly, though not catastrophically, and resources were available in lesser quantities. Independent businesses caved, allowing a merchant-centric system of factories to develop where hundreds of craftsmen worked for the same supplier and financier. The bead factory had ten living rooms and a large workplace courtyard. The coppersmith's workshop had five furnaces and paved sinks to enable multiple artisans to work.&lt;ref name="Rao13"&gt;{{cite book
| title = Lothal
| publisher = [[Archaeological Survey of India]]
| author = [[S. R. Rao]]
| page = 13
| year = 1985
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The declining prosperity of the town, paucity of resources and poor administration increased the woes of a people pressured by consistent floods and storms. Increased salinity of soil made the land inhospitable to life, including crops. This is evidenced in adjacent cities of [[Rangpur, India|Rangpur]], [[Rojdi]], [[Rupar]] and Harappa in [[Punjab region|Punjab]], [[Mohenjo-daro]] and [[Chanhudaro]] in [[Sindh]]. A massive flood (c. 1900&amp;nbsp;BCE) completely destroyed the flagging township in a single stroke. Archaeological analysis shows that the basin and dock were sealed with silt and debris, and the buildings razed to the ground. The flood affected the entire region of Saurashtra, Sindh and south [[Gujarat]], and affected the upper reaches of the [[Indus river|Indus]] and [[Sutlej]], where scores of villages and townships were washed away. The population fled to inner regions.&lt;ref name="Rao134"&gt;{{cite book

===Later Harappan culture===
[[File:Lothal - warehouse.jpg|thumb|upright 1.5|The warehouse of Lothal]]
Archaeological evidence shows that the site continued to be inhabited, albeit by a much smaller population devoid of urban influences. The few people who returned to Lothal could not reconstruct and repair their city, but surprisingly continued to stay and preserved religious traditions, living in poorly built houses and reed huts. That they were the Harappan peoples is evidenced by the analyses of their remains in the cemetery. While the trade and resources of the city were almost entirely gone, the people retained several Harappan ways in writing, pottery and utensils. About this time ASI archaeologists record a mass movement of refugees from Punjab and Sindh into Saurashtra and to the valley of [[Sarasvati River|Sarasvati]] (1900–1700&amp;nbsp;BCE).&lt;ref name="RV"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of ill-equipped settlements have been attributed to this people as [[Cemetery H culture|''Late Harappans'']] a completely de-urbanised culture characterised by rising illiteracy, less complex economy, unsophisticated administration and poverty.

The people of Lothal made significant and often unique contributions to human civilisation in the Indus era, in the fields of [[city planning]], art, architecture, science, engineering, pottery and religion.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Their work in [[metallurgy]], [[seal (device)|seals]], [[beads]] and jewellery was the basis of their prosperity.

A thick ring-like shell object found with four slits each in two margins served as a [[compass]] to measure angles on plane surfaces or in the horizon in multiples of 40&amp;nbsp;degrees, up to 360&amp;nbsp;degrees. Such shell instruments were probably invented to measure 8–12 whole sections of the horizon and sky, explaining the slits on the lower and upper margins. Archaeologists consider this as evidence that the Lothal experts had achieved something 2,000&amp;nbsp;years before the Greeks: an 8–12 fold division of horizon and sky, as well as an instrument for measuring angles and perhaps the position of stars, and for navigation.&lt;ref name="Rao401"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lothal contributes one of three measurement scales that are integrated and linear (others found in Harappa and Mohenjodaro). An ivory scale from Lothal has the smallest-known decimal divisions in Indus civilisation. The scale is 6&amp;nbsp;millimetres (0.2&amp;nbsp;inches) thick, {{convert|15|mm|in|abbr=on}} broad and the available length is {{convert|128|mm|in|abbr=on}}, but only 27 graduations are visible over {{convert|46|mm|in|abbr=on}}, the distance between graduation lines being {{convert|1.70|mm|in|abbr=on}} (the small size indicates use for fine purposes). The sum total of ten graduations from Lothal is approximate to the ''angula'' in the ''[[Arthashastra]]''.&lt;ref name="Rao394"&gt;{{cite book

For their renowned draining system, Lothal engineers provided [[corbel]]led roofs, and an apron of kiln-fired bricks over the brick face of the platform where the sewerage entered the cesspool. Wooden screens inserted in grooves in the side drain walls held back solid waste. The well is built of radial bricks, {{convert|2.4|m|ft|abbr=off}} in diameter and {{convert|6.7|m|ft|abbr=off}} deep. It had an immaculate network of underground drains, silting chambers and cesspools, and inspection chambers for solid waste. The extent of drains provided archaeologists with many clues regarding the layout of streets, organisation of housing and baths. On average, the main sewer is {{convert|20|–|46|cm|in|abbr=on}} in depth, with outer dimensions of 86&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;68&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;33&amp;nbsp;cm (34&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;27&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;13&amp;nbsp;in). Lothal brick-makers used a logical approach in manufacture of bricks, designed with care in regards to thickness of structures. They were used as headers and stretchers in same and alternate layers. Archaeologists estimate that in most cases, the bricks were in ratio 1:0.5:0.25 on three sides, in dimensions which were integral multiples of large graduations of Lothal scale of {{convert|25|mm|in|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="RaoL"&gt;{{cite book

===Religion and disposal of the dead===
[[File:Ancient site at Lothal14.jpg|thumb|Twin burial from Lothal.]]
The people of Lothal worshipped a fire god, speculated to be the horned deity depicted on seals, which is also evidenced by the presence of private and public fire-altars where religious ceremonies were apparently conducted. Archaeologists have discovered gold pendants, charred ashes of terra-cotta cakes and pottery, bovine remains, beads and other signs that may indicate the practice of the Gavamayana sacrifice, associated with the ancient [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic religion]].&lt;ref name="RaoDA"&gt;{{cite book

| year = 1985
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Animal worship is also evidenced, but not the worship of the [[Mother Goddess]] that is evidenced in other [[Harappa]]n cities—experts consider this a sign of the existence of diversity in religious traditions. However, it is believed that a sea goddess, perhaps cognate with the general Indus-era Mother Goddess, was worshipped. Today, the local villagers likewise worship a sea goddess, ''Vanuvati Sikotarimata'', suggesting a connection with the ancient port's traditions and historical past as an access to the sea.&lt;ref name="R2"&gt;{{cite book

It is suggested that the practice occurred only on occasion. It is also considered that given the small number of graves discovered—only 17 in an estimated population of 15,000—the citizens of Lothal also practised [[cremation]] of the dead. Post-cremation burials have been noted in other Indus sites like Harappa, Mehi and Damb-Bhuti.&lt;ref name="Rao45"&gt;{{cite book

===Metallurgy and jewellery===
Lothal copper is unusually pure, lacking the [[arsenic]] typically used by coppersmiths across the rest of the Indus valley. The city imported [[ingot]]s from probable sources in the Arabian peninsula. Workers mixed tin with copper for the manufacture of [[celt (tool)|celts]], arrowheads, fishhooks, chisels, bangles, rings, drills and spearheads, although weapon manufacturing was minor. They also employed advanced metallurgy in following the ''cire perdue'' technique of casting, and used more than one-piece moulds for casting birds and animals.&lt;ref name="Rao43VA"&gt;{{cite book
| title = Lothal

Lothal was one of the most important centres of production for shell-working, owing to the abundance of chank shell of high quality found in the [[Gulf of Kutch]] and near the [[Kathiawar]] coast.&lt;ref name="Rao43VA"/&gt; Gamesmen, beads, [[unguent]] vessels, [[chank]] shells, ladles and inlays were made for export and local consumption. Components of stringed musical instruments like the [[plectrum]] and the [[bridge (instrument)|bridge]] were made of shell.&lt;ref name = "Rao43"/&gt; An ivory workshop was operated under strict official supervision, and the domestication of elephants has been suggested. An ivory seal, and sawn pieces for boxes, combs, rods, inlays and ear-studs were found during excavations.&lt;ref name="Rao43"&gt;{{cite book
| title = Lothal
| publisher = [[Archaeological Survey of India]]

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lothal produced a large quantity of gold ornaments—the most attractive item being microbeads of gold in five strands in necklaces, unique for being less than 0.25&amp;nbsp;millimetres (0.010&amp;nbsp;inches) in diameter. Cylindrical, globular and jasper beads of gold with edges at right angles resemble modern pendants used by women in [[Gujarat]] in plaits of hair. A large disc with holes recovered from a sacrificial altar is compared to the ''rukma'' worn by Vedic priests. Studs, cogwheel and heart-shaped ornaments of fainence and [[steatite]] were popular in Lothal. A ring of thin copper wire turned into double spirals resembles the gold-wire rings used by modern Hindus for weddings.&lt;ref name="RaoVI"&gt;{{cite book

===Art===
[[File:Ancient site at Lothal115.jpg|thumb|Archaeological Museum of Lothal, replica of seal.]]
[[File:Lothal pottery.png|thumb|Pieces of red [[clay]] pottery]]
The discovery of etched [[carnelian]] beads and non-etched barrel beads in [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]] and [[Ur]] (modern [[Iraq]]), [[Jalalabad]] ([[Afghanistan]]) and [[Susa]] ([[Iran]]) attest to the popularity of the Indus bead industry across West Asia.&lt;ref name="RaoS"&gt;{{cite book
| title = Lothal
| publisher = [[Archaeological Survey of India]]
| author = [[S. R. Rao]]
| pages = 31–33
| year = 1985
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[lapidary|lapidaries]] select stones of variegated colours, producing beads of different shapes and sizes. The methods of Lothal bead-makers were so advanced that no improvements have been noted over 4,000&amp;nbsp;years—modern makers in the [[Khambhat]] area follow the same technique. Double-eye beads of [[agate]] and collared or gold-capped beads of [[jasper]] and carnelian beads are among those attributed as uniquely from Lothal. It was very famous for micro-cylindrical beads of [[steatite]] (chlorite).&lt;ref name="RaoVI"/&gt;
The Lothal excavation yielded 213 seals, third in volume amongst all Indus sites. Seal-cutters preferred short-horned bulls, mountain goats, tigers and composite animals like the elephant-bull for engravings. There is a short inscription of [[intaglio (jewellery)|intaglio]] in almost every seal. Stamp seals with copper rings inserted in a perforated button were used to sealing cargo, with impressions of packing materials like mats, twisted cloth and cords, a fact verified only at Lothal. Quantitative descriptions, seals of rulers and owners were stamped on goods. A unique seal found here is from [[Bahrain]]—circular, with motif of a dragon flanked by jumping gazelles.&lt;ref name="Rao3G"&gt;{{cite book

Lothal offers two new types of potter work, a convex bowl with or without stud handle, and a small jar with flaring rim, both in the [[mica]]ceous Red Ware period, not found in contemporary Indus cultures. Lothal artists introduced a new form of realistic painting.&lt;ref name="V457"&gt;{{cite book
| title = Lothal
| publisher = [[Archaeological Survey of India]]
| author = [[S. R. Rao]]
| pages = 45–47
| year = 1985
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paintings depict animals in their natural surroundings. On one large vessel, the artist depicts birds with fish in their beaks, resting in a tree, while a fox-like animal stands below. This scene bears resemblance to the story of [[The Fox and the Crow (Aesop)|The Fox and the Crow]] in the ''[[Panchatantra]]''.&lt;ref name="Rao46F"&gt;{{cite book
| title = Lothal
| publisher = [[Archaeological Survey of India]]
| author = [[S. R. Rao]]
| page = 46
| year = 1985
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artistic imagination is also suggested via careful portrayals—for example, several birds with legs aloft in the sky suggest flight, while half-opened wings suggest imminent flight. On a miniature jar, the story of the thirsty crow and deer is depicted – of how the deer could not drink from the narrow-mouth of the jar, while the crow succeeded by dropping stones in the jar. The features of the animals are clear and graceful. Movements and emotions are suggested by the positioning of limbs and facial features—in a {{convert|15|x|5|cm|in|abbr=on}} jar without overcrowding.&lt;ref name="Rao46F"/&gt;

A complete set of terra-cotta gamesmen, has been found in Lothal—animal figures, pyramids with ivory handles and castle-like objects (similar to the chess set of Queen [[Hatshepsut]] in Egypt).&lt;ref name="Ra5"&gt;{{cite book
| title = Lothal
| publisher = [[Archaeological Survey of India]]
| author = [[S. R. Rao]]
| pages = 47–48
| year = 1985
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The realistic portrayal of human beings and animals suggests a careful study of anatomical and natural features. The bust of a male with slit eyes, sharp nose and square-cut beard is reminiscent of [[Sumer]]ian figures, especially stone sculptures from [[Mari, Syria|Mari]]. In images of men and women, muscular and physical features are sharp, prominently marked. Terra-cotta models also identify the differences between species of dogs and bulls, including those of horses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://asi.nic.in/asi_exca_imp_gujarat.asp|title=Excavation Sites in Gujarat - Archaeological Survey of India|website=asi.nic.in|access-date=2018-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Animal figures with wheels and a movable head may have been utilised as toys.

==Excavated Lothal==
[[File:Lothal - water well.jpg|thumb|The main well]]
On plan, Lothal stands {{convert|285|m|ft|abbr=off}} north-to-south and {{convert|228|m|ft|abbr=off}} east-to-west. At the height of its habitation, it covered a wider area since remains have been found {{convert|300|m|ft|abbr=off}} south of the mound. Due to the fragile nature of unbaked bricks and frequent floods, the superstructures of all buildings have receded. Dwarfed walls, platforms, wells, drains, baths and paved floors are visible.&lt;ref name="RaoY"/&gt; But thanks to the [[loam]] deposited by persistent floods, the dock walls were preserved beyond the great deluge (c.&amp;nbsp;1900&amp;nbsp;BCE). The absence of standing high walls is attributed to erosion and brick robbery. The ancient nullah, the inlet channel and riverbed have been similarly covered up. The flood-damaged peripheral wall of mud-bricks is visible near the warehouse area. The remnants of the north-south sewer are burnt bricks in the cesspool. Cubical blocks of the warehouse on a high platform are also visible.&lt;ref name="RaoY"&gt;{{cite book

The ASI has covered the peripheral walls, the wharf and many houses of the early phase with earth to protect from natural phenomena, but the entire archaeological site is nevertheless facing grave concerns about necessary preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ancient Lothal crumbling under modern neglect|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/ie/daily/19981214/34851124.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030919082503/http://www.indianexpress.com/ie/daily/19981214/34851124.html|archivedate=19 September 2003|accessdate=|newspaper=Indian Express|date=14 December 1998|location=India}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Salinity]] ingress and prolonged exposure to the rain and sun are gradually eating away the remains of the site. Heavy rain in the region has damaged the remains of the sun-dried mud brick constructions. Stagnant rain water has lathered the brick and mud work with layers of moss. Due to [[silt]]ation, the dockyard's draft has been reduced by {{convert|3|–|4|m|ft}} and saline deposits are decaying the bricks. Officials blame the salinity on [[capillary action]] and point out that cracks are emerging and foundations weakening even as restoration work slowly progresses.&lt;ref name="IE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/india-news/ie20010820/top7.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20090227003900/http://www.indianexpress.com/india-news/ie20010820/top7.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=27 February 2009 |title=Harappan mound needs the kiss of life |work=The [[Indian Express]] |author=Janyala Sreenivas |accessdate=27 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dockyard===
[[File:Dock_at_lothal.JPG|thumb|The dock, with a canal opening to allow water to flow into the river, thereby maintaining a stable water level.]]
[[File:Mechanism to control water flow at the "Dockyard.JPG|thumb|Remains of canal opening, built with burnt bricks.]] 
The dockyard was located away from the main current to avoid deposition of silt. It is speculated that Lothal engineers studied tidal movements, and their effects on brick-built structures, since the walls are of kiln-burnt bricks. This knowledge also enabled them to select Lothal's location in the first place, as the [[Gulf of Khambhat]] has the highest tidal amplitude and ships can be sluiced through flow tides in the river estuary. The engineers built a trapezoidal structure, with north-south length of average {{convert|215|m|ft|abbr=off}}, and east-west width of {{convert|35|m|ft|abbr=off}}.&lt;ref name="Rao2819"&gt;{{cite book
| title = Lothal
| publisher = [[Archaeological Survey of India]]
| author = [[S. R. Rao]]
| pages = 28–29
| year = 1985
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another assessment is that the basin could have served as an irrigation tank, for the estimated original dimensions of the "dock" are not large enough, by modern standards, to house ships and conduct much traffic.&lt;ref name="JSTOR"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Leshnik |first1=Lawrence S. |title=The Harappan "Port" at Lothal: Another View |journal=American Anthropologist |date=1968 |volume=70 |issue=5 |pages=911–922 |jstor=669756}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Criticism of the dock theory has grown since first doubted by Leshnik in 1968 and later Yule in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The original height of the embankments was {{convert|4.26|m|ft|abbr=off}}. (Now it is {{convert|3.35|m|ft|abbr=off| disp=or}}.) The main inlet is {{convert|12.8|m|ft|abbr=off}} wide, and another is provided on the opposite side. To counter the thrust of water, offsets were provided on the outer wall faces. When the river changed its course in 2000&amp;nbsp;BCE, a smaller inlet, {{convert|7|m|ft|abbr=off}} wide was made in the longer arm, connected to the river by a {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=off}} channel. At high tide a flow of {{convert|2.1|–|2.4|m|ft}} of water would have allowed ships to enter. Provision was made for the escape of excess water through the outlet channel, {{convert|96.5|m|ft|abbr=off}} wide and {{convert|1.7|m|ft|abbr=off}} high in the southern arm. The dock also possessed a ''lock-gate'' system—a wooden door could be lowered at the mouth of the outlet to retain a minimum column of water in the basin so as to ensure flotation at low tides.&lt;ref name="Rao2819"/&gt; Central to the city's economy, the warehouse was originally built on sixty-four cubical blocks, {{convert|3.6|m|ft|abbr=off}} square, with {{convert|1.2|m|ft|abbr=off|adj=on}} passages, and based on a 3.5-metre-high (11.5&amp;nbsp;ft) mud-brick podium. The pedestal was very high to provide maximum protection from floods. Brick-paved passages between blocks served as vents, and a direct ramp led to the dock to facilitate loading. The warehouse was located close to the acropolis, to allow tight supervision by ruling authorities. Despite elaborate precautions, the major floods that brought the city's decline destroyed all but twelve blocks, which became the makeshift  storehouse.&lt;ref name="Rao171"&gt;{{cite book

===Acropolis and lower town===
[[File:Lothal - lower town.jpg|thumb|The lower town]]
Lothal's acropolis was the town centre, its political and commercial heart, measuring {{convert|127.4|m|ft|abbr=off}} east-to-west by {{convert|60.9|m|ft|abbr=off}} north-to-south. There were three streets and two lanes running east-west, and two streets running north-south. The four sides of the rectangular platform on which houses were built are formed by mud-brick structures of {{convert|12.2|–|24.4|m|ft}} thickness and {{convert|2.1|–|3.6|m|ft}} high.&lt;ref name="Rao191"&gt;{{cite book
| title = Lothal

| author = [[S. R. Rao]]
| pages = 19–21
| year = 1985
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The baths were primarily located in the acropolis—mostly two-roomed houses with open courtyards. The bricks used for paving baths were polished to prevent seepage. The pavements were lime-plastered and edges were wainscoted (wooden panels) by thin walls. The ruler's residence is {{convert|43.92|m2|mi2|abbr=off}} in area with a 1.8-square-meter-bath (19&amp;nbsp;sq&amp;nbsp;ft) equipped with an outlet and inlet. The remains of this house give evidence to a sophisticated drainage system. The Lower town marketplace was on the main north-south street {{convert|6|–|8|m|ft}} wide. Built in straight rows on either side of the street are residences and workshops, although brick-built drains and early period housing has disappeared. The street maintained a uniform width and did not undergo encroachment during the reconstructive periods after deluges. There are multiple two-roomed shops and workplaces of coppersmiths and blacksmiths.&lt;ref name="Rao234"&gt;{{cite book

The bead factory, which performs a very important economic function, possesses a central courtyard and eleven rooms, a store and a guardhouse. There is a cinder dump, as well as a double-chambered circular kiln, with stoke-holes for fuel supply. Four [[flue]]s are connected with each other, the upper chamber and the stoke hold. The mud plaster of the floors and walls are vitrified owing to intense heat during work. The remnants of raw materials such as reed, cow dung, sawdust and agate are found, giving archaeologists hints of how the kiln was operated.&lt;ref name="Rao23"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large mud-brick building faces the factory, and its significance is noted by its plan. Four large rooms and a hall, with an overall measurement of {{convert|17.1|x|12.8|m|ft}}. The hall has a large doorway and a raised floor in the southern corner of the building.

'''Marcos E. Becerra''' (April 25, 1870 – January 7, 1940) was a prolific Mexican writer, poet, and politician. He produced pioneering [[history|historical]], [[linguistics|linguistic]], [[philology|philological]], and [[ethnography|ethnographic]] studies relating to his country's [[pre-Columbian]] and [[New Spain|early colonial]] past. He held important posts in the [[Politics of Mexico|Mexican Federal Government]] as well as in the state governments of Tabasco and [[Chiapas]]. He was a distinguished member of the Mexican Academy of History.

==Biography==
Marcos Enrique Becerra was born in [[Teapa]], [[Tabasco]], to Camilo Becerra [[Spanish names#The particle "y"|y]] Ballinas, a native of [[San Cristóbal de las Casas]], [[Chiapas]], and Luisa Sánchez Formento. Becerra completed his early schooling in his hometown. In 1900, by way of independent study, he received a teaching degree from the [[Universidad Juárez Autónoma de Tabasco#History|Instituto Juárez]] of [[Villahermosa, Tabasco|San Juan Bautista]]. During his youth he worked as a [[book binding|bookbinder]], [[scribe]], store clerk, [[prompter (theatre)|theatre prompter]], and, eventually, teacher. One of his very first published works, ''Guia del lenguaje usual para hablar con propiedad, pureza y corrección'', dates from this period (1901) and is based on his [[autodidactism|autodidactic]] studies of the [[Spanish language]].

Fame of his remarkable erudition spread quickly and he was encouraged to run in forthcoming elections for [[Deputy (legislator)|Federal Deputy]] for the State of Tabasco, succeeding in his first attempt. During the final years of the ''[[Porfiriato]]'' he held the federal post of [[Director General]] of [[Secondary Education]] of the [[Secretariat of Public Education]]. At the XVII [[International Congress of Americanists]], celebrated in Mexico City in September 1910, Becerra presented an important historical paper on [[Hernán Cortés|Hernán Cortés's]] 1524-25 expedition to [[Honduras#Etymology|Las Hibueras]]. The next year, he returned to Tabasco to serve in Governor [[Manuel Mestre Ghigliazza]]'s administration as [[General Secretary|Secretary General]] of Government and as Director of Public Education; consequent to the assassination of President [[Francisco I. Madero]] in February 1913 both Ghigliazza and Becerra resigned their posts in protest.

In 1914, Becerra moved to [[Tuxtla Gutiérrez]] (the Chiapas state capital), where he would labor as an educator and occupy the same post of Director of Public Education for ten years; during which time he successfully reorganized the state's educational system, founded a school of commerce as well as the Internado Indígena de San Cristóbal (the San Cristóbal [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indian]] [[Boarding School]]), which was a model of its kind. In 1921, while still in Tuxtla, he published an important [[lexicography|lexicographical]] work titled ''La nueva gramática castellana'', which, like all his published writings, was the fruit of autodidactic erudition. In 1932, appeared what remains one of his best known scholarly works, ''Nombres geográficos indígenas de Chiapas'', a study of [[Maya peoples|Mayan]] [[place names]]. To these followed sundry studies, published as [[monograph]]s or articles, on the languages and traditions of the [[Ch'ol people|Ch'ol]], [[Mangue people|Mangue]], [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]], [[Maya peoples#Belize|Yucatec Maya]], and [[Zoque people|Zoque]].

In 1954, occurred the [[List of works published posthumously|posthumous]] publication of Becerra's monumental 800 page ''Rectificaciones y adiciones al [[Diccionario de la Real Academia Española]]'': a work which encompasses thousands of words and definitions, is rich in [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|indigenous]] [[etymology|etymologies]] and grounded in [[Linguistic prescription#Authority|lexicographical authorities]].

Marcos E. Becerra, during the last ten years of his life, was a [[wikt:numerary|numerary]] member of the Mexican Academy of History and held [[Chair (official)|seat]] 21. He was married twice and was twice a widower, He died, following a long illness, in [[Mexico City]] on January 7, 1940.

A '''media event,''' also known as a pseudo-event,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scherer|first1=Helmut|title=Media Events and Pseudo-Events|url=http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405131995_chunk_g978140513199518_ss36-1|website=Blackwell Reference Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an event or activity conducted for the purpose of media [[publicity]]. It may also include any event that is covered in the [[mass media]] or was hosted largely with the media in mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| publisher = Houghton Mifflin Company
| url = http://www.bartleby.com/61/89/M0188900.html

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Media events may center on a news announcement, an [[anniversary]], a [[news conference]], or planned events like speeches or demonstrations.  Instead of paying for advertising time, a media or pseudo-event seeks to use [[public relations]] to gain media and public attention.

The term pseudo-event was coined by the [[theorist]] and [[historian]] [[Daniel J. Boorstin]] in his 1961 book ''[[The Image: A Guide to Pseudo-events in America]]'': “The celebration is held, [[Photo Op|photographs are taken]], the occasion is widely reported.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boorstin|first=Daniel Joseph
 |title=The image: A guide to pseudo-events in America
 |publisher=Vintage|location=New York|year=1961|isbn=0-679-74180-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is closely related to idea of [[hyperreality]] and thus [[postmodernism]], although Boorstin’s coinage  predates the two ideas and related work of postmodern thinkers such as [[Jean Baudrillard]]. A media event being a kind of [[Event management|planned event]], it may be called [[Authenticity (philosophy)|inauthentic]] in contrast to a spontaneous one.

In distinguishing between a pseudo-event and a spontaneous one, Boorstin states characteristics of a pseudo-event in his book titled "Hidden History."  He says that a pseudo-event is: dramatic, repeatable, costly, intellectually planned, and social.  It causes other pseudo-events, and one must know about it to be considered "informed".&lt;ref&gt;Boorstin, D. Hidden History. Harper &amp; Row, 1987. 279-280. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, Elihu Katz outlines the defining characteristics of a media event as: immediate (i.e., it is broadcast live), organized by a non-media entity, containing ceremonial and dramatic value, preplanning, and centering on a personality, whether that be a single person or a group&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Katz|first1=Elihu|title=Media Events: The Sense of Occasion|url=http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1271&amp;context=asc_papers|website=University of Pennsylvania ScholarlyCommons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of [[video art]]ists have explored the concept of a pseudo-event. The group [[Ant Farm (group)|Ant Farm]] especially plays with pseudo events, though not so identified, in their works "Media Burn" (1975) and "[[The Eternal Frame]]" (1975).

A [[news conference]] is often held when an organization wants members of the press to get an announcement simultaneously. The in-person events may include interviews, questioning, and show-and-tell.

Media events like news conferences can come to be expected, especially before, during, and after sporting events, and the [[National Football League]] demands that its players provide a weekly media event by taking postgame questions from reporters.  When Seattle Seahawks running back [[Marshawn Lynch]] dressed and left the stadium after a loss on Nov. 16, 2014, the NFL fined him $100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Werder|first1=Ed|title=Silence Costs Marshawn Lynch $100K|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/11904067/nfl-takes-100k-seattle-seahawks-marshawn-lynch-media-silence|website=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Award ceremony|Award ceremonies]], red carpet events and celebrity [[photo op]]portunities are all considered a type of media event, where the event is orchestrated for the purpose of introducing a chosen narrative into the media.

[[Sex tape|Sex tapes]] when created with the intention of being 'leaked' are a form of pseudo event because their purpose is to generate media attention.

A [[protest]] may be planned almost exclusively for the purpose of getting media attention to an issue or cause.

[[Political convention|Political conventions]], or planned presentations or speeches about company earnings or political issues, are a form of media event.

== Historic examples ==
Media events became prominent when the media did. The driving of the [[Golden Spike]] in [[Promontory Summit, Utah]], in 1869 has been described as one of the first media events in the United States.  [[Edward Bernays]] and his [[Torches of Freedom]] campaign in 1929 is an example of an early media event that successfully influenced public opinion.  Similarly, [[Nikita Khrushchev]] visit to the United States in 1959 was highly influential, and has been cited as the first example of media events being utilised in politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| title = Defining Moment: Nikita Khrushchev’s visit to the US becomes the first ‘pseudo-event’, September 1959
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Media events became practical in the middle 19th century as the Morse [[telegraph]] and the expansion of [[daily newspaper]]s introduced same-day [[news cycle]]s.  The emergence of the internet led to many media stories being published live from the media event, real-time Twitter coverage, and immediate analysis of televised media events. When musical artist [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] pretended to take questions during his [[Super Bowl]] press conference but instead broke immediately into song, his performance itself became a meta media-event-within-a-media-event&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prince--The Super Bowl Press Conference 2007|url=http://www.wat.tv/video/prince-the-superbowl-press-6pq1b_2hztv_.html|website=Wat|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109225101/http://www.wat.tv/video/prince-the-superbowl-press-6pq1b_2hztv_.html|archivedate=2015-01-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Middle East Forum''' ('''MEF''') is an [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservative]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/14/washington/14cair.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin Scrutiny Increases for a Group Advocating for Muslims in U.S.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[think tank]] founded in 1990 by [[Daniel Pipes]], who serves as its president.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fpa.org/topics_info2414/topics_info_show.htm?doc_id=125024 "Middle East Forum"] listed in "Search Results" and "Resource Library" on the website of the [[Foreign Policy Association]]; cf. organization website for [http://www.meforum.org Meforum.org], Middle East Forum, one of [http://www.danielpipes.org/sites.php DanielPipes.org"], "Daniel Pipes's websites" (incl. its "Mission" statement), all accessed February 24, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; MEF became an independent [[non-profit organization]] in 1994.  It publishes a journal, the ''[[Middle East Quarterly]]''.

Based on a belief that the [[United States]] has vital interests in the region of the [[Middle East]], according to the organization, they advocate strong ties with [[Israel]] and other democracies as they emerge; work for human rights throughout the region; seek a stable supply and a low price of oil; and promote the peaceful settlement of regional and international disputes.&lt;ref name=Pipes&gt;[[Daniel Pipes]], [http://www.danielpipes.org/mef.php "The MEF Mission"], ''danielpipes.org'' (personal organization website of Daniel Pipes), n.d., accessed February 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Middle East Forum, a [[501(c)#501(c)(3)|501(c)3]], has established the Legal Project to protect researchers and analysts who work on the topics of Islam and related topics from lawsuits designed to silence their exercise of free speech and to discuss key issues of public concern.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.meforum.org/participation/legal-project/ Meforum.org]&lt;/ref&gt;
The Legal Project aided [[Geert Wilders]]' legal defense when he faced a criminal indictment for his views in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadafreepress.com/index.php/article/8976 CanadaFreePress.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications and projects==

===''Middle East Quarterly''===
The ''[[Middle East Quarterly]]'' (''MEQ'') is a quarterly journal devoted to Middle Eastern affairs. It was founded in 1994 by [[Daniel Pipes]] and the current editor is [[Efraim Karsh]], Research Professor and former Director of Middle East and Mediterranean Studies at [[King's College London]].''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meforum.org/staff/Efraim+Karsh Biography of Efraim Karsh]; Middle East Forum&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Middle East Quarterly's website, "policy-makers, opinion-makers, academics, and journalists" consult ''MEQ'' "for in-depth analysis of the rapidly-changing landscape of the world's most volatile region." The journal also seeks to publish "groundbreaking studies, exclusive interviews, insightful commentary, and hard-hitting reviews that tackle the entire range of contemporary concerns – from politics to economics to culture, across a region that stretches from Morocco to Afghanistan."&lt;ref name=MEQ&gt;''[http://www.mequarterly.org Middle East Quarterly]''.  Publication website hosted by its sponsoring organization, Middle East Forum, accessed February 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Campus Watch===
In 2002, the Middle East Forum initiated the [[Campus Watch]] program and identified what it finds to be the five major problems in the teaching of Middle Eastern studies at American universities: "analytical failures, the mixing of politics with scholarship, intolerance of alternative views, [[apologetics]], and the [[abuse of power]] over students."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. from "Mission Statement," in [http://www.campus-watch.org/about.php "About Campus Watch"], ''Campus Watch'' (''campus-watch.org''), n.d., accessed February 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Winfield Myers]] is the current director of Campus Watch (2007).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meforum.org/staff.php "Who's Who at Campus Watch"], ''Middle East Forum'' (''meforum.org''), n.d., accessed February 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, Campus Watch published a list of problematic instructors, which led some professors to accuse Campus Watch of "McCarthyesque" intimidation; in protest, more than 100 other academics asked to be listed too.&lt;ref name=Schevitz&gt;Tanya Schevitz, [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2002/09/28/MN227890.DTL "Professors Want Own Names Put on Mideast Blacklist"], ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' September 28, 2002, accessed February 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Campus Watch removed the list from its website.&lt;ref name=Schevitz2&gt;Tanya Schevitz, [http://www.campus-watch.org/article/id/209 "'Dossiers' Dropped from Web Blacklist"], ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' October 3, 2002, accessed February 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ayloush&gt;Hussam Ayloush, [http://www.campus-watch.org/article/id/416 "Column a Slur on Muslim Community"], ''[[Orange County Register]]'' December 1, 2002, accessed February 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamist Watch===
On April 21, 2006, the Middle East Forum launched [http://www.islamist-watch.org/ Islamist Watch], a project that Islamist Watch states it "combat[s] the ideas and institutions of nonviolent, radical Islam in the United States and other Western countries. It exposes the far-reaching goals of Islamists, works to reduce their power, and seeks to strengthen moderate Muslims." 

According to the organization's website, Islamist Watch seeks to educate the government, media, religious institutions, the academy, and the business world about lawful Islamism. It focuses on the political, educational, cultural, and legal activities of Islamists in the United States and, to a lesser degree, in other historically non-Muslim countries, especially Western Europe, Canada, and Australia.&lt;ref name=mefIW&gt;[http://www.meforum.org/islamist.php "Islamist Watch"] (information page), ''Middle East Forum'', n.d., accessed February 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Islamist Watch does not focus on [[counter terrorism]] and only indirectly concerns Islamism in Muslim-majority countries such as [[Egypt]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and [[Pakistan]], and its three main "activities" include "research, advocacy, and activism."&lt;ref name=mefIW/&gt;

In 2012, Marc Fink became the director of Islamist Watch.

=== The Legal Project ===

The Middle East Forum established the Legal Project in June, 2007, to protect researchers, analysts, and activists who work on radical Islam and related topics from [[Strategic lawsuit against public participation|predatory lawsuit]]s designed to silence their exercise of free speech.&lt;ref name="Legal-Project.org"&gt;[http://www.legal-project.org/about.php Legal-Project.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Legal Project's website, it acts in four ways to counteract Islamist threats to free speech, "Fundraising for an Escrow account to supplement the court costs and litigation fees for victims of Islamist lawfare (all funds raised go directly to lawfare victims); Arranging for pro bono and reduced rate counsel for victims of Islamist lawfare; Maintaining an international network of attorneys dedicated to working pro bono in the defense of free speech; and, Raising awareness about the issue. Efforts include briefings by legal experts on how to avoid libelous statements, and consultations with libel lawyers before publishing on certain topics."&lt;ref name="Legal-Project.org"/&gt;

=== ''Middle East Intelligence Bulletin'' ===
The Middle East Intelligence Bulletin was jointly published by the {{ill|United States Committee for a Free Lebanon|de}} and the Middle East Forum. It was, from 1999-2004, a free monthly publication, that provided analysis of political and strategic developments in Lebanon, Syria &amp; the Middle East.&lt;ref name=MEIB&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.meforum.org/meib/ | title=Middle East Intelligence Bulletin (MEIB) | publisher=United States Committee for a Free Lebanon and the Middle East Forum | accessdate=October 19, 2017 | author=Gambill, Gary C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Moses Schorr''', Polish: '''Mojżesz Schorr''' (May 10, 1874 – July 8, 1941) was a [[rabbi]], [[Polish history|Polish historian]], politician, [[Biblical criticism|Bible scholar]], [[Assyriology|assyriologist]] and [[Oriental studies|orientalist]]. Schorr was one of the top experts on the [[history of the Jews in Poland]]. He was the first Jewish researcher of Polish archives, historical sources, and [[pinkasim]]. The president of the 13th district [[B'nai B'rith]] Poland, he was a humanist and modern rabbi who ministered the central synagogue of Poland during its last years before the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]].

Schorr was the first historian to undertake the systematic study of Jewish history in Poland, and Galicia in particular. He made discoveries after finding and translating Babylonian, Assyrian, and Hittite legislative annals. As a scholar of the [[jurisprudence]] and civilizations of the [[Ancient Near East|Ancient Middle East]], Schorr was a legal philosopher and sociologist of Ancient Middle Eastern societies. Schorr was appointed to the Polish Senate by Polish president [[Ignacy Mościcki]] (1926–1939). Schorr did not belong to any political party, although he was inclined to [[Zionism]]. He was active in the social, public, and religious life of Polish Jews, and was often chosen by them to head public organisations and represent Polish Jewry to Polish and international powers, though he never sought this role for himself.

==Birth and early years==

Moses Schorr was born on May 10, 1874, in the town of [[Przemyśl]] in [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]], then a [[Kreis in Prussia|kreis]] town within [[Austro-Hungarian empire]]. Moses was the oldest son of Osjasz Schorr, the director of the Jewish cooperative bank in Przemyśl, and of Esther Schorr (née Friedman). He had two brothers, Adolf and Samuel, who both became lawyers in [[Lwów]] and [[Jarosław]], respectively. Moses started his education at the Przemyśl [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] where he completed his studies in 1893. At gymnasium, and from his father and private teachers, he acquired the basics of Judaic lore. Among his teachers was the grandfather of an outstanding [[Slavic studies|Slavist]], [[Moshe Altbauer]], who instructed Moses in the  [[Bible]] and [[Talmud]].

==Rabbinical and philosophical studies==

Schorr moved to [[Vienna]], where he embarked upon the study of theology at the [[Israelitisch – Theologische Lehranstalt]] (Jewish Theological Institute) from 1893 to 1900. The institute, founded in October 1893 with the assistance of [[Albert von Rothschild]], was modeled in part after the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau]]. At that time it had 11 teachers and 26 students preparing for the rabbinate. Among Schorr's teachers were Adolf Schwarz in Talmud and religious-ritual codes, David Heinrich Müller in Biblical [[exegesis]] and Semitic linguistics, Adolf Bücher in Jewish history and [[Meir Friedman]] in [[Midrash]] studies. Schorr studied philosophy at [[University of Vienna]] and [[Lviv University]]  between 1893 and 1898. During his studies in Vienna, Schorr learned Hebrew and other oriental languages, showing particular interest in Egyptian mythology and psychology.

In 1898 Schorr attained the degree of Doctor of Philosophy and Medieval Studies at Lviv University. In spring 1900 he received the diploma of rabbi in Vienna, being among the first dozen graduates of Rothschild's seminary.

===Lecturing in Lviv===

Soon after graduation he became a lecturer at the Jewish Teachers Seminary  and the Teachers Gymnasium in [[Lviv]], working there until 1923, while he also engaged in educational and social work. Of his time teaching in Lwów he wrote to Polish sociologist [[Ludwik Gumplowicz]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt; ... For a long time I have not written to you of my old intentions to continue studying aiming at a dozent position. Besides, that "spirit" of semitology ... has not left me for a moment, haunting me as a shadow at every step. I have not lost contact with orientalistics, not for a bit. I have used every free minute to get acquainted with the ever growing literature, but unfortunately these free moments are quite rare. Professional work takes a lot of my time and causes a painful conflict between a forced, often mechanical work which I lack internal vocation for, and the results of my [oriental] studies ... On one hand, I do not want to be a charlatan in the profession, I even know that I have a certain mission as the religion teacher in Galicia and could even attain the "laurels" of the reformer in this subject. But I lack this specific ambition or enthusiasm. On the other hand, I am becoming convinced that I would have to study at least a year at the university (Berlin or Leipzig) so that I could independently work with Assyriology here. I have to admit for a moment that I have become a personality here, and everywhere they try to involve me in a friendly, humanitarian and scientific life ... and every day the circle of my "social virtues" widens itself — popular meetings, ceremonial speeches, committees, collectives ''etc., etc.,'' — all this distracts me from my work, as I see myself suddenly thrown into the whirl of life when I would like to remain still unknown among my co-confessors. As an unripened apple I am plucked from the tree and I still miss my tree — knowledge. As for the altruistic impulses, I think that I still have enough time to realize them ...                     Lviv, January, 1901&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Schorr corresponded with a number of intellectuals of that time, including [[Ludwig Gumplowicz]], to whom he wrote at least 46 letters, and [[Simon Dubnow]] in Odessa. His correspondence with Dubnow has not been studied yet. Schorr's letters to Gumplowicz were published by R. Żebrowski.

==Studies in Semitic languages==

Schorr received a scholarship from the Austrian Ministry of Education. He went to [[Berlin]] for two years where he studied Semitic languages, Assyriology, and the history of the ancient Orient under the guidance of famous scholars. In 1905–1906, he studied Arabic philology in Vienna under the guidance of semitologist David Heinrich Müller, who exerted a strong influence on Schorr. Müller taught Schorr Biblical criticism and Semitology at the Seminary, and a decade later, Arabic linguistics. Müller advanced a theory on the structure and form of the Biblical Psalms, which Schorr later developed in a series of articles.

==Professor at Lviv University==

In 1904 Schorr was appointed a lecturer as [[privatdozent]], and in March 1910, associate professor of Semitic languages and history of the Ancient Orient at Lviv University, a chair which he later held in Warsaw.

In 1904–1905 he headed the ''Toynbeehali'', the Society for the promotion of education among Jews in Lviv. He was one of the founders and long-term members of ''Opieka'' ("Care"), a society to support Jewish Youth in the secondary schools. During his stay in Lviv, Schorr was one of the founders and the first head of the "Society of the teachers of Moses religion of the people's secondary schools of Galicia". He led the first teachers' congress in 1904 in Lviv. He was a member of the board of the Jewish Community Library in Lviv from its inception, and later was its head.

===Relation to Zionism===

Schorr took part in the 7th Zionist Congress of 1910 in [[Basel]]. The Congress and his stay in Switzerland made an impression on Schorr, as he writes to Gumplowicz:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is no need to stress how strong an impression I got from the wonderful views of Swiss nature. I will stay here in Basel for 14 days for the whole duration of the 7th Zionist Congress, which is going to start on Thursday. Already today there are several hundred guests, most from Russia, among them the outstanding Jewish figures, and many ladies, as well. Already today, the Congress seems to me to be the most powerful manifestation of Jewish solidarity around the world. During the entire course of Jewish history, there was no such movement that would so deeply enter the consciousness of all the Jews with such an enthusiasm. But already nowadays various groups with different tendencies are being formed, away from the main fundamental idea.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Schorr took part in the conference but did not make any public speeches. Regarding the Zionist movement, he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As for the Zionist movement ... I am noting in advance, that in my opinion the historical proofs can not be decisive for the present. After all, Professor Winkler proved that the Jews had never been to Egypt but does this mean that the Jewish religion, that is based on the fact of the Exodus of the Jews from Egypt and its consequences, should disappear from history?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Żebrowski presumes that Schorr's participation in the Congress was perhaps one of the reasons that a rich merchant, a banker and fervent Zionist, chose Schorr as a husband for his daughter Tamara. They were married in the synagogue of [[Prussia]]n [[Königsberg]] (modern Kaliningrad) on 31 October 1905.

===Professor in Semitic languages===

In April 1916 Schorr received the degree of merited professor of Lviv University in the field of Semitic languages and Ancient Oriental history, combining this post with other duties at the same university until 1923. In 1912 he participated in the international congress of orientalists in Athens, where he was one of the secretaries of the semitology section and presented a lecture entitled "Sumerian and Semitic Beginnings of the Ancient Babylonian Law", which was published in the Paris edition of ''Revue Semitique''. In 1918 he became a member of the Oriental committee at the Kraków Academy, and in 1920 a member of the Polish Scientific Society in Lviv, and in 1923 one of the founders of the Polish Oriental Society in Lviv.

In 1917-1918 he headed the Jewish Rescue Committee in Lviv, and from 1916 on he was a member of the central committee to help the Jewish orphans in the city. The Society of Jewish National and Secondary school, which was established at the beginning of 1919, chose him its first head, and in 1920 entitled him a merited member of the society.

==Transfer to Warsaw==

[[File:Wielka Synagoga w Warszawie.PNG|thumb|[[Great Synagogue, Warsaw]], where Schorr preached]]

Schorr moved to [[Warsaw]] in 1923. He was invited to Warsaw to succeed [[Samuel Abraham Poznański|Samuel Poznański]] as preacher at the [[Great Synagogue, Warsaw]] on [[Tłomackie]] street. Designed to seat 1,100, it was the largest synagogue and community in Europe and second largest in the world, behind only New York. {{#tag:ref|He was its last minister, and started his term 20 years before it was blown up by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] in retaliation for the [[Warsaw ghetto uprising]] in 1943.|group=note}}The Warsaw Judaic community numbered 352,659 Jews in the 1931 census. Schorr also became a member of the Warsaw rabbinical council, one of the top Jewish religious authorities in Poland. Some of his preachings were published. He was elected to the position of inter-regional rabbi whose main duties and functions were to represent the Jewish community in front of the state and administrative authorities. Schorr was appointed a member of the city and regional School Councils by the Jewish community board.

In 1924 he became the head of the State Examination Committee for Jewish teachers of religion and Judaic subjects in secondary schools, and a member of the Ministerial Commission for the evaluation of school handbooks in the field of Judaica.

==Warsaw University==

In 1926 Schorr became a professor at the [[University of Warsaw]]. Schorr headed the Institute of Semitic languages and history of the Ancient Orient. In 1927 he initiated the creation of the Committee for setting up the Jewish Library at the Great Synagogue in Warsaw and became its head. This library was completed in 1936. Today the library building houses the [[Jewish Historical Institute]].

===Institute of Judaic Sciences in Warsaw===

In February 1928 Schorr, together with [[M. Balaban]], Tohn and Braud, founded the [[Institute of Judaic Sciences]] for the research of Judaic sciences and Judaism, in particular Biblical subjects, philosophy, religion, Talmud, sociology, Semitic languages and Hebrew literature. It was located on the site of the present-day [[:pl:Żydowski Instytut Historyczny|Jewish Historical Institute]], beside the Great Synagogue. It functioned on a state budget, with donations from foreign Jewish institutions. The Institute retained a library which numbered over 35,000 books, documents and magazines. Professor Schorr became the first rector of the newly created institution, and served in that capacity during 1928-1930 and 1933-34.

In 1933-1934 he was elected a member of the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]], and in 1935 a member of the Finnish Oriental Society in Helsinki. In 1937 Schorr received the title of merited doctor from the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York.

==Schorr and B'nai B'rith==

From 1901 on, Schorr was a member of the humanitarian society [[B'nai B'rith]] "Leopolis" in Lviv, where for a few years he led the library. The B'nai B'rith "Leopolis" was founded in 1889 and since 1932 had its own building at 3 Maja street, 10. The archival documentation of B'nai B'rith "Leopolis" has been partially preserved and is still to be studied. From 1922 "Leopolis" was incorporated into the 13th district of B'nai B'rith Poland and numbered 217 persons, the largest lodge in Poland.

From 1921 Schorr was the president of the Lviv branch of B'nai B'rith in Galicia, part of the 12th district of B'nai B'rith Austria.

In 1922 Schorr was elected the vice president of the Polish district, while the president was  lawyer Dr Adolf Ader from Kraków. From 1924 he was the president of the lodge ''Braterstwo'' ("Brotherhood") in Warsaw. This lodge numbered 85 members, including 32 merchants, 14 physicians, 13 engineers, eight lawyers, eight industrialists, six bankers, one writer, three senators (Moses Koerner, Schorr, and banker Rafael Szereszowski), one deputy (lawyer Dr Apolinary Hartgas) and two professors — Schorr and his close colleague, historian and friend Meir Balaban. The lodge reached its highest membership in 1931, when it had 130 members. After Schorr's resignation from its presidency, his role was taken over by Meir Balaban and consequently the lodge was headed by lawyer Maurycy Edelman, merchant Maurycy Meyzel, Seminary director Meir Tauber and lawyer Ignacy Bamberg.

The headquarters of Warsaw ''Braterstwo'' lodge were located at Rymarska 8 street. In the years of his presidency, Schorr organised many initiatives, undertakings, and cultural events, managed the meetings of so-called "speaking diaries" with the participation of renown personalities, writers and publicists. He took part in the creation of Auxilium Academicum Judaicum, an organisation formed for the erection of the Jewish Academic House in Warsaw. Schorr's brotherhood played a role in the founding of the Reform Institute of Judaic Sciences and the publishing society Menora that published the magazine ''Miesięcznik Żydowski'' (Jewish Monthly, 1930–1935), which was under the influence of B'nai B'rith. Through the Warsaw lodge, Schorr co-organised and supported the Relief Committee for the Jewish victims of the economic crisis, continuing his role in the religious affairs of the nomination of rabbis and Orthodox influences. While heading the Warsaw lodge, Schorr set up a special literary award for an outstanding writer of Jewish origin.

Rich members of the lodge played an important role in the charity activities of the lodege. Among them was a friend of Schorr, wood merchant Horacy Heller, who assigned for social activities 20,000 dollars. Significant sums were donated by his colleagues, banker Szereszowski (one of two Jewish colleagues in the Polish Senate), Dr. Joseph Landau, industrialist Maurycy Raabe, and others. In the years 1937–1938, a violent anti-Masonic campaign took place in Poland that led to the special decree of 1938 that dissolved any sort of free Masonic societies, including B'nai B'rith.

Moses Schorr performed the functions of vice president of the B'nai B'rith Lodge "Solidaność" (Solidarity) in Kraków. There are dozens of letters written by Schorr preserved in the B'nai B'rith collection of the State Archives in that city. During his presidency Schorr corresponded with a number of B'nai B'rith officials, including the Secretary of the Great Conventional Lodge in Chicago. Polish historian Dr Bogusława Czajecka delivered a paper "Moses Schorr as social activist in the light of B'nai B'rith documents (1922–1938)" during the scientific session on Schorr at the Polish Academy of Arts in Kraków in 1993.

Schorr's views on B'nai B'rith's goals and their practical application in terms of social activities are expressed in his work {{pl icon}} "Ideals of the Order B'nai B'rith and their Application Towards Real Life Conditions." Schorr describes B'nai B'rith as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt; ... The union of B'nai B'rith, as an international organization (...) is characterized by two fundamental principles: the idea of solidarity of all the Jews in the entire world (...), the idea of universalism of humanity, the brotherhood of all the peoples and nations (...). These two ideas I consider for the highest goal of our spiritual and intellectual program ... &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Schorr's initiative helped with the creation of the Lodge "Montefiory" in [[Łódź]], then the second largest Jewish urban community in Poland, with 222,497 Jews. In 1928 lodges "Montefiore" and "Braterstwo" took up the discussion concerning the official name of the organisation, arguing between B'nai B'riss and B'nei B'rith formulations. Schorr's suggestion "...taking into consideration the scientific and practical views, the name of the order should be written "B’nei B’rith"  was adopted unanimously.

Schorr authored an appeal of the information bureau of the lodge "Braterstwo" about the situation of the Jews in Germany and other countries after [[German federal election, March 1933|1933]]. Schorr was a member of the committee which managed the bureau. His goal in the activity of B'nai B'rith was to unify the principle of national solidarity among the Jews with the ideas of universalism.

==Schorr and political life==

Though Schorr did not take an active part in political life, he participated as a scientific expert in a questionary campaign about the problems of the Jewish community in Poland arranged in February 1919 by the Governmental Commission. The protocols of the campaign were published in a separate book, ''W sprawie polsko-żydowskiej. Ankieta'' ("Concerning the Polish-Jewish question. Questionnary").

Schorr concentrated mainly on scientific work, teaching, and social activities, rather than politics, but in 1935, the president of Poland [[Ignacy Mościcki]] named him Senator in the parliament. In his parliamentary speeches, along with articles in the Jewish press, such as ''[[Nasz Przegląd]]'' and ''Chwila,'' Schorr expressed his concern about the growth of [[antisemitism]] in Poland and the passive conduct of the authorities in this regard. He led the Jewish immigration and colonial committee, which aimed to make possible the Jewish immigration from Poland to countries other than Palestine. He participated in the [[Évian Conference]] in France on the problem faced by 500,000 Jewish refugees from Germany and Austria with the advent of the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]] and the ''[[Anschluss]]'' of Austria in 1938. The Évian Conference, held in [[Évian-les-Bains]] on the French shore of Lake Geneva, was convened at the initiative of [[President of the United States|US President]] [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Franklin D. Roosevelt]], who invited European, American, and Australian delegates for an open discussion on organising the resettlement and immigration of those who experienced persecution on the basis of religion or race. Schorr was one of the key speakers in Évian and was highly involved as many Jews fled Germany for Poland.  [[Golda Meir]] represented [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] as an observer.

==Last years==

After the beginning of [[World War II]], Schorr entered the Jewish Civil Committee and on 6 or 7 September he left Warsaw. He knew that the Nazis would not spare him, as he was an active Jewish social leader who often spoke against fascism in the parliament. These fears forced him and his wife, Tamara, to escape eastwards. His daughter Felicia lived in the town of [[Ostróg]] near [[Rivne|Równe]] with her three children (two her own and one of her sister Sonia). Moses and Tamara Schorr reached Ostróg on 27 September.

===Arrest by NKVD===

[[File:Schorr1.jpg|thumb|Moses Schorr after the arrest in 1941]]
The appearance of Schorr was quickly noted by Soviet securities in the town. Two days after his arrival, Schorr was arrested by [[Ostróg]] [[NKVD]] (Soviet secret police) branch, and was kept in custody in the local prison for a week. Later he was transferred to the nearby regional administrative center of [[Łuck]], where he spent another week in prison.

===Confinement and questioning===

On 24 of September he transferred to Lvov, where he had lived until 1923. In confinement, Schorr was forced to fill in a questionnaire, was photographed, and had his personal belongings taken: his golden watch, pen, scissors, organiser, a file of photos. The scholar was asked when, by whom and why was he appointed for the Senator's position, when did he become a rabbi, and to which party did he belong. Schorr answered that President Mościcki appointed him to the Polish Senate in the capacity of Rabbi of Warsaw and that he did not belong to any political party. The prosecutor noted down only his words concerning his rabbinical functions and an account of the marriage of Schorr's daughter Sophia (residing in Paris) with an official of the Polish Ministry of Justice. Schorr's wife and daughter Felicia moved to Lviv, where Felicia worked as a waitress.

===Imprisonment at Lubyanka===

On February 3, the newly appointed Russian prosecutor of the Lvov branch of the NKVD, Lopunov, received an order from the Deputy of the Peoples Committee of the [[Ministry for State Security (Soviet Union)|Ministry for State Security]] [[Vsevolod Nikolayevich Merkulov|V.N. Merkulov]] to send him to Moscow for a continuation of the investigation. Schorr was sent in convoy to the First Special Department of the Soviet NKVD. In the accompanying documentation, he was noted to be "healthy".

In Moscow he was held in [[Lubyanka (KGB)|Lubyanka Prison]], in the same cell with the [[General Jewish Labour Bund|Bund]] activist [[Victor Alter]], the poet [[Władysław Broniewski]], and the Polish Senator of the [[National Party (Poland)|National Party]] professor [[Stanisław Głąbiński]]. The Polish nationalist later recollected that became such close friends that they slept together on one bench. In the accounts of cell inmate Mrs. Wisia Wagner from 10 August 1943 we read:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Cell no. 21 was little. It housed 30 persons. Among them the main rabbi of Warsaw, renowned scientist, professor of Warsaw University Dr Moses Schorr, the activist of Bund Victor Alter, Senator professor Stanisław Gląbiński – the leader of Polish National Democrats and other personalities, who formed the intellectual elite of Poland. I spent a few days together with Professor Schorr. Despite his elderly age, he was constantly taken for torturing questioning and beaten. He was awakened in the middle of the night, led away for many hours and only in the morning returned. As he told us in the cell, he was accused of belonging to the protagonists of the bourgeois government. I spent 10 days with Prof Schorr and was astonished by his spiritual posture, despite the sufferings, he did not allow himself to get broken and after questioning was coming back calm and full of dignity. By chance he happened to share his cell with the leader of ''[[Endecja]]'' [Polish Nationalist Party pursuing the policy of tough assimilation of the minorities]. The representative of Jewish people and former antisemite went into so friendly a relationship that they slept on the same cell bed. After 10 days Prof Schorr was driven off from our prison and I have not seen him ever since.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Liberation attempts===

The attempts to liberate Schorr, which were undertaken by the [[Polish government-in-exile]] with the mediation of the [[Holy See|Vatican]] and the [[United States Department of State]] did not succeed. In February 1940, [[Cordell Hull]], as Secretary of State during the presidency of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], appealed to the Soviet powers through the mediation of international organisations to find Schorr and rescue him from the Soviet prisons. This did not produce any results. The President of the Council of Ministers of the Polish government in exile, [[Władysław Sikorski]], applied to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of his government with the following letter:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I ask you Sir Minister about the entreatment of our Ambassador in the Vatican with the intervention, aimed to free Professor Schorr, arrested by the Bolshevik powers in Lviv. I consider the diplomatic means through Vatican to be the most advisable solution of this matter. After release, I ask you to direct Professor Schorr to France. Head of the Council of Ministers – Gen. Div. Sikorski.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Concentration camp and death===

On 17 April 1941, Schorr was assigned to five years of mandatory prison labour. He was taken to the NKVD's fifth concentration camp in Posty, [[Uzbekistan]], where he got sick and died in a camp hospital on 8 July 1941. He was buried in grave no. C-30 on the grounds of the hospital. Polish authorities {{Who|date=October 2009}} learned of his death only on the eve of 1942, after diplomatic relations were established between the Polish London government and the Soviet government. The Polish government tried to liberate him a second time, planning to appoint him to the post of the main Rabbi of the [[Anders Army]], which was forming at that time, but it was too late.

Jewish publisher A. Sztibel wrote the following lines about Schorr :

&lt;blockquote&gt;At every ship arriving in America from Europe, nearly every Polish Jew claims to be the leader of the Jews of Poland. These are the people, whose names I never heard, despite the fact that I was born and brought up in Poland. In the meanwhile professor Schorr, a real authority of Polish Jewry, is kept in Bolshevik prisons and no one makes the slightest effort to rescue him ... (A. Sztibel, letter to Cyrus Adler)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Schorr's family==

After the German attack of the Soviet Union ([[Operation Barbarossa]]—June 1941), Schorr's wife,  daughter Felicia, and grandchildren, left Lviv for Warsaw. They endured internment in the [[Warsaw ghetto]], but obtained [[Costa Rica]]n and [[Nicaragua]]n passports (from daughter Sonia). They were next interned at Warsaw's [[Pawiak]] Prison on 19 June 1942 as citizens of a neutral state. After several months, they were transferred to the French town of [[Vittel]] in [[Alsace]], where they arrived on 20 October 1943, to be exchanged for German prisoners of war. In Vittel, they were held in a special hotel guarded by the [[Gestapo]] along with 300 other Jews with foreign passports.

After more than a year of waiting, it became clear that the next day they would all be deported to the [[Drancy internment camp]], from where detainees were transported to [[Auschwitz]]. Tamara Schorr and her daughter Felicia Kon decided to commit suicide on 17 April 1944 so that Felicia's children, as orphans, could avoid transfer. Tamara Schorr died after consuming poison. Her daughter Felicia was wounded after she jumped out a window, and was taken to hospital. Their other daughter, Sonia, managed to reach [[New York City]] with her husband Arthur Miller toward the end of 1940.

===Children===

Schorr was married in 1905 to Tamara Ben Jacob, the daughter of Yitzhak Ben Jacob (1858–1926), a publisher, [[Zionist]], [[banker]] and bibliographer from [[Wilno]]. They had six children:

* Sonia, wife of Arthur Miller, the prosecutor of the Warsaw High Court and the head of the Criminal law Department at the [[Ministry of Justice of Poland]]; she died in 1961.
* Deborah (died in Lviv in 1917) 
* Felicia Kon-Lipets; (died in [[New York City]] in 1984) 
* Ludwig (1918–1963), an architect who settled in [[Tel Aviv]] 
* Esther, in marriage Ben-Kohav (died in [[Jerusalem]] in 1991)
* Joshua (Otton), an engineer in [[Jerusalem]] who died in 2005

==Awards and remembrances==

Schorr was awarded Poland's [[Golden Cross of Merit]]. His name is listed on the memorial next to the [[Polish Sejm|Polish Parliament]] erected in memory of the Senators of the II Polish Republic who perished at the hands of the NKVD and the Nazis.

A scientific meeting was devoted to Schorr. In 1993 a similar meeting took place at the Polish Academy of Sciences in Kraków. In 2001 an Educational Center named in honor of Prof. Moses Schorr was established in Warsaw, aimed at the education of the Jewish community remaining in Poland. Schorr Center was founded as one of the projects of [[Ronald Lauder#Jewish and Zionist efforts|Ronald Lauder Foundation]] to cultivate Jewish literacy, culture, and history among Jews all over Poland.

===Streets in Israel named after Schorr===

There are streets named after Schorr in [[Jerusalem]], [[Tel Aviv]] and [[Holon]].

==Scientific legacy==

The first stream of Schorr's scientific activity deals with the history of Polish Jews. Schorr's historiographic approach and view upon the methodology applied to the study of the history of Polish Jewry is summarized in his own writing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The major defect of the methods of research of Jewish history in Poland is that the general issues were studied before the details had been exposed. There was attempt to present the history of the Jews in entire Poland, before this history had been reviewed in specific cities. The historical entireness was treated, before the elemental processes had been exposed. 
Therefore, also today's general works on the history of Polish Jewry, and they are few after all, are characterised by the dilettante forms, lacking integrity, accurateness and clarity in subject presentation. Their material used is meager and not sufficient to encompass the entirety of the history of Polish Jewry, neither in the political-economic sphere nor in the cultural developments. An appropriate solid basis for such a general task can only be constructed by virtue of the archival material, which is so abundantly accumulated in different archives and partially the libraries. The fundamental, scientific presentation of the entire history will only be possible when the factual historical, economic and cultural developments in the major cities will be multilaterally studied on the basis of archival sources. Publication and analysis of the archival documents should be the first task preceding the general studies."  — M. Schorr. Lviv, October 1902&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The techniques and methods Schorr used in historical studies were far ahead of his young age (28) and the time in which he worked. He began his scientific work as an auditor in Vienna University in 1897 with his paper entitled ''Zur Geschichte des Don Josef Nasi'' ("Concerning the history of Don Joseph Nasi"), which was published in ''Monatschrift fur die Wiessenschaft des Judenstum.'' In this work he analyses the relations of [[Joseph Nasi]] (1524-1579) with the Polish king [[Sigismund August]] (1520-1572) in light of the situation of Jews in Poland at that time. Joseph Nasi was a Portuguese born [[marrano]] (secret Jew) appointed the [[Vassals of the Kingdom of Jerusalem|Lord of Tiberias]] and the [[Duchy of the Archipelago|Duke of Naxos and the Seven Islands]]. He was one of the first [[Zionist]]s and an influential Ottoman statesman during the reign of [[Selim II]] (1566–1574). Schorr analysed the relations of Joseph Nasi with Poland. Though he was a 20-year-old student at the time, he corrected a fundamental error of Graetz, a leading historian, who claimed that Sigismund August acknowledged a number of commercial privileges for the Polish Jews by virtue of the services of Joseph Nasi to Polish diplomacy at the Ottoman court. On the basis of sources found by Schorr in the historical city archives of Lviv, he came to the conclusion that Joseph Nasi was not guided by altruism but wanted the privilege to trade in Lviv for himself, and obtained it.

===Doctoral dissertation===

Schorr's doctoral dissertation, entitled ''Organizacja Żydów w Polsce'' ("The Organisation of Jews in Poland"), was first published in Lviv's historical quarterly, ''Kwartalnik historyczny'' in 1899, and was later translated into Russian and published in ''[[Voskhod (magazine)|Voskhod]]''. In 1903 Schorr was awarded the [[Wawelberg|Wawelberg Prize]] (provided by the famous Polish-Russian banker and philanthropist) for his work ''Żydzi w Przemyślu do roku 1772'' ("Jews in [[Przemyśl]] until 1772"). It was republished in 1991 in Jerusalem with an introduction by [[Jakub Goldberg]] and an epilogue by his last surviving son, Joshua Otton Schorr. The ''Organisation of Jews in Poland'' is a serious attempt to summarise the data about the ''[[Qahal]]'' organisation of the central institutions of Jewish self-administration—the ''[[vaad]]s'' and the brotherhoods of Jewish craftsmen. Schorr wrote to [[Ludwik Gumplowicz]] from Vienna in October 1897:

&lt;blockquote&gt; ... the organization of Jews in Poland is thus one of the most important and the most interesting parts of Jewish culture in Poland; I will only note the huge importance "the council of four lands" had directing the life of Polish Jews for 200 years. In general, my intention is to devote myself to the study of Jewish history in Poland. For the next task of mine I consider the publication of the most important archival documents concerning the Jews—the way Bershadsky began that already. During my search of the City Historical Archives in [[Lwów]], I became convinced that there are real treasures for the history of Polish Jews. I am staying all the time in Vienna, except holidays. I still have 1½ years until finishing my theological studies. I doubt very much that I will be following the profession of a preacher [rabbi] in practice. I am more fond of scientific work. I repeat that your interest in my historical works is a good stimulus for me; that motivates me even more to my intended research .... &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Monograph "Jews in Przemyśl"===

Another work, the monograph about the Jews in [[Przemyśl]], is precious not only for its concise examination of the history of this community but also for the numerous [[Poland|Polish]], [[Latin]], and [[Hebrew]] documents from the 16th to 18th centuries concerning the history of the Przemyśl Jewish community, which are added at the end of the book: nearly half of the work. Schorr starts his historical account from the early 15th century, when the first Jews began to appear sporadically in significant numbers in the major cities of Czerwona Rus' [[Red Ruthenia]]: Lviv, [[Halych|Halicz]], Przemyśl and [[Sanok]]. The first historical mention of Jews in Przemyśl dates  from 1466, and Schorr included next a review of the privileges of [[Sigismund II August]] (1548–1572); a ''statute ad bonum ordinem'' of [[Stephen Báthory of Poland]] (king of Poland from 1576 to 1586) and other privileges; contracts; antisemitic assaults; and documents about internal Jewish organisation. The last chapter deals with the Jewish professional brotherhoods, including Jewish artisan and tailor fraternities—their emergence, organisation, and role in society. The author  notes Jewish religious societies such as the Society of Psalms Readers (whose task was gathering in synagogue each day before sunrise to recite the psalms) and the ''[[Chevra kadisha]]'' (the holy society responsible for burying the dead). Schorr explores the ''[[pinkasim]]'' (books or journals) of the brotherhoods. He was the first to note the existence of Jewish artisan brotherhoods in that period after finding the records of the Przemyśl guild of Jewish artisans from the 17th and 18th centuries. The wide usage of pinkasim for historical studies was innovative at that time.

Among the wide range of sources presented in the second part of the book we find the first fundamental privilege given by king Sigismund II August to the Jews of Przemyśl in 1559, allowing them to live there with the same rights and freedoms as other townsmen (no. 1); the Order of Sigismund II August to the mayor and counselors regarding the attack on the Jews in 1561 (no. 2); the contract of 1595 between the town hall and Jewish elders on the matter of Jewish participation in the fortification of the city (no. 20); the protest of town pharmacists against the Jewish elders for the production of medical items by the Jews in 1677 (no. 121); the order of the governor of Rus' lands [[Jabłonowski]] allowing a free election of a rabbi after the ardent requests of "unfaithful" Jewish elders and the whole synagogue of Przemyśl (no. 130). Several Polish sources from 1759 published in this edition (nos. 143 – 144) deal with charges against the Jews of Stupnica in a supposed ritual Easter murder, their tortures and refusal of the charges, and the consequent execution of the accused. A similar Polish document (no. 76) from the year 1646 deals with charges of ritual child murder against twelve Przemyśl Jews, one of whom was punished. Schorr preserves the archaic form of the [[old Polish language]] in the documents which gives them a special character.

===Work on Jewish laws and privileges===

Schorr published ''The Cracow code of Jewish laws and privileges in Poland'', and wrote an article about its significance and the contradictory questions regarding the main privileges.

Schorr is the author of a lengthy article about the [[Hebrew language]] in the ''Encyklopedja Polska'' (Polish Encyclopedia, vol. III, 1915). One of his last works in the field of Jewish history in Poland, is ''Rechtsstellung und innere Verfassung der Juden in Polen'' ("The Legal Situation and Internal Organisation of Jews in Poland"), published in German in Berlin and Vienna in 1917.

===Schorr as Orientalist===

The second major stream of Schorr's scientific activity concerns [[Biblical criticism|Bible studies]] (in particular research of Biblical Law), [[Assyriology]], and the history of the [[Ancient Near East]] in general. Schorr's works were mainly focused on these subjects from 1904. Schorr's switch to Oriental studies was caused partly by professional circumstances: Polish historian Krzysztof Pilarczyk notes that Schorr could not be assured of a professorship in the field of Jewish history in Poland. In 1902 Schorr became interested in the newly discovered [[Hammurabi Code]] and thus in the laws of Ancient Babylon and Assyria. Schorr's interest was rooted in his religious beliefs and interest in the Bible and Oriental and Egyptian mythology. His years at the gymnasium and university prepared him to study texts in the Hebrew, Assyrian, and Babylonian languages.

His first works in Oriental studies included a paper on the excavations and discoveries at [[Amarna]] (1900), followed by the investigation of ''Starożytności biblijne w swietle archiwum egipskiego'' ("Biblical Antiquities in the Light of the Egyptian Archive"). This was published in the magazine ''Przewodnik naukowy i literacki'' in 1901 and separately as well. In 1903 Schorr commented extensively on ''Babel und Bibel'' ("Babylon and Bible"), a book by his former German tutor [[Friedrich Delitzsch]] (1902). Schorr's commentary, "Kultura Babilońska a starohebrajska" ("Babylonian and Hebrew Culture"), appeared in Lviv's ''Kwartalnik historyczny'' and later in a separate edition. ''Kwartalnik Historyczny'' was the major publication for Lviv historians at that time and Schorr was one of its regular contributors.

Some of Schorr's works were written and published in German, his second native language; German was then an official Habsburg language in Eastern Galicia, along with Polish and Ukrainian. One such study is ''Die Kohler-Peiserische Hammurabi Übersetzung'' ("The Peiser-Kohler Translation of the Hammurabi Code).

===Research on Babylonian history===

Schorr's main work on the subject of Babylonian history was ''Państwo i społeczeństwo babilońśke w kresie t.zw. dynastyi Hammurabiego'' ("The Babylonian State and Society at the Time of the Hammurabi Dynasty); this was published as a separate volume in 1906 in Lviv and later was published in ''Kwartalnik historyczny.''  Another work by Schorr in German is ''Eine Babylonische Seisachtie aus dem Anfang der Kassitenzeit, ende XVIII vorchristl. Jahrhunderts'' ("The Babylonian Seisachtie of the Times of the Kassites Dynasty, the End of 18th century BC"). In this paper Schorr presents and discusses an ancient Babylonian text newly discovered by the Oxford Assyriologist [[Stephen Herbert Langdon]].

He conducted research on the history of the social and commercial life of the Ancient Orient, and particularly trade in ancient Babylon. The work's title is ''Ruch handlowy w Satorożytnej Babilonii'' ("The trade movement in old Babylon"). It was published in 1911 in a commemorative book celebrating the 25th anniversary of the founding of Lviv University.

Schorr translated and systematised old Babylonian legal documents and wrote an extensive commentary entitled ''Altbabylonische Rechtsurkunden aus der Zeit der I -ste Babylonische Dynastie'' ("Old Babylonian legal documents from the First Babylonian dynasty"). The legal issues and the legal history of the laws were the main subjects of Schorr's research. He did significant research in comparative studies of the legal systems of Babylon and the surrounding cultures of that time, in particular the Hebrew legal system.

''Kodeks Hammurabiego a ówczesna praktyka prawna'' ("The Hammurabi Code and Ancient Oriental Legal Practices") first appeared in ''Rozprawy'' (Studies) of the historical department of Kraków Academy of Sciences; in 1907 it was published separately.

Schorr's ''Urkunden des altbabylonische Zivil- und Prozessrechts'' ("The Documents of the Old Babylonian Civil and Criminal Law) is considered to be his greatest scholarly achievement in the Oriental field. It is a volume of sources with extensive comments by Schorr.

==Publications in Zionist daily ''Chwila''==

Schorr actively cooperated with the Lviv Zionist newspaper ''Chwila'' ("The Wave"), published in  the inter-war period. These articles remain unexamined by historians. The newspapers for 1918-1939 are kept in the scientific library of [[Lviv University]]. The most important articles are ''Palestyna a Babylon w świetle najnowszych wykopalisk'' ("Palestine and Babylon in the Light of Recent Archaeological Excavations", 1923); and ''[[Samuel Hirsch Margulies]]'' (1922), which is dedicated to Galicia native Samuel Hirsch Margulies (1858–1922), who became the leader of [[Italian Jews|Italian Jewry]]. This article was in commemoration of Margulies, who had died that year. In the  obituary, Schorr writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Italian Jewry has undergone a great loss in the death of the Rabbi of Florence and rector of local rabbinical seminary Dr. Samuel Hirsch Margulies (died on March 12), who had been the Rabbi for more than three decades leaving a strong footprint on a life and culture of the Jews of whole Italy. Margulies was of Polish origin...In 1890 he was called for the position of the Rabbi of [[Florence]], where he managed to become the leader of whole Italian Jewry. He became the spiritual leader in all the spheres of the civic life, on account of his deep Judaic knowledge, organisational abilities and personal favourite pursuits in the subjects of spirit and heart. Thanks to him the indifferent religious life of Italian Jews started to be a live artery filled with strong native Jewish traditions and culture. He also initiated the centralized unification of all Jewish communities which created a new Collegio rabbinico italiano...in Florence...This seminary produced an array of young Rabbis, who started the spiritual renaissance of Italian Jewry."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Schorr's broadest article in ''Chwila'' was ''Prawo Mojżesza na tle poròwnawczem prawodawst Starożytnego Wschodu'' (The Laws of Moses in Comparative Perspective with the Laws of the Ancient Orient"). This work was a series of articles in several newspaper issues, where Schorr draws  comparisons between Biblical and Babylonian laws in the first part of the series, following with a comparison with the Assyrian and Hettite legislatures in the second and third sections. Schorr also refers back to his previous work, ''The [[Hettites]]' Problem'', published seven years before in ''Kwartalnik historyczny''.

A few other newly discovered publications of Schorr should be mentioned include ''Kwestya żydowska w dobie Sejmu Wiekiego'' ("The Jewish Question at the Time of the Great Sejm"); religious teachings such as ''Radosna Chwila'' ("The Joyful Moment"), and ''Pesach Micarim - Pesach le Atid'' on the occasion of the Easter celebration.

A '''novelogue''' is a story told almost exclusively through dialogue. Character descriptions, and settings are minimally provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Novelogue : Dialogic Storytelling|url=http://www.novelogue.com/|work=webpage|accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

A "[[novel]]" or "prose novel" is defined as: "A novel is a book of long narrative in literary prose. The genre has historical roots both in the fields of the medieval and early modern romance and in the tradition of the novella. The latter supplied the present generic term in the late 18th century...

A novelogue is a combination between the words "novel" and "dialogue", and it is written more like a screenplay than a novel.  Prose are only used in brief segments of the story where character and setting descriptions are necessary.  Otherwise, the story is told through conversation.  Characters enter and exit as if moving around a world stage, like they would in a [[screenplay]] or [[Play (theatre)|stage play]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Novelogue|url=http://www.adamsbook.com/supplementalMaterial.aspx|publisher=Adams Book Company|accessdate=5 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A novelogue is also considered a form of "dialogic storytelling".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McCabe|first=Allyssa|title=Developing narrative structure|year=1991|isbn=978-0-8058-0475-1|pages=180|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-0scdDeKnj0C&amp;pg=PA180&amp;lpg=PA180&amp;dq=dialogic+storytelling&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bFq_18gOea&amp;sig=GaRO80bQAmcBXs87_s1uHvyYTeE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=SwLbTtTOEofV0QHRyPTBDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=dialogic%20storytelling&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Performing arts}}
'''Puppetry''' is a form of [[theatre]] or performance that involves the manipulation of [[puppet]]s – [[inanimate]] objects, often resembling some type of human or animal figure, that are animated or manipulated by a human called a [[puppeteer]]. Such a performance is also known as a {{nowrap|'''puppet play'''}}. The puppeteer uses movements of her hands, arms, or control devices such as rods or strings to move the body, head, limbs, and in some cases the mouth and eyes of the puppet. The puppeteer often speaks in the voice of the character of the puppet, and then synchronizes the movements of the puppet's mouth with this spoken part. The actions, gestures and spoken parts acted out by the puppets are typically used in [[storytelling]].

There are many different varieties of puppets, and they are made of a wide range of materials, depending on their form and intended use. They can be extremely complex or very simple in their construction. The simplest puppets are [[finger puppet]]s, which are tiny puppets that fit onto a single finger, and [[sock puppet]]s, which are formed from a sock and operated by inserting one's hand inside the sock, with the opening and closing of the hand simulating the movement of the puppet's "mouth". A [[hand puppet]] is controlled by one hand which occupies the interior of the puppet and moves the puppet around ([[Punch and Judy]] puppets are familiar examples of hand puppets). A "live-hand puppet" is similar to a hand puppet but is larger and requires two puppeteers for each puppet. [[Marionette]]s are suspended and controlled by a number of strings, plus sometimes a central rod attached to a control bar held from above by the puppeteer.

Puppetry is a very ancient form of theatre which was first recorded in the 5th century BC in [[Ancient Greece]]. Some forms of puppetry may have originated as long ago as 3000 years [[Before Christ|BC]].&lt;ref name="blumenthal"/&gt; Puppetry takes many forms, but they all share the process of animating inanimate performing objects to tell a story. Puppetry occurs in almost all human societies where puppets are used for the purpose of entertainment through performance, as [[sacred]] objects in [[rituals]], as symbolic [[Effigy|effigies]] in celebrations such as [[carnival]]s, and as a catalyst for social and psychological change in [[transformative arts]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Strings, Hands, Shadows: A Modern Puppet History'', John Bell, Detroit Institute of Art, 2000, {{ISBN|0-89558-156-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Puppetry is a very ancient art form, thought to have originated about 4000 years ago.&lt;ref name="blumenthal"&gt;Blumenthal, Eileen, ''Puppetry and Puppets'', Thames &amp; Hudson, 2005. {{ISBN|978-0-500-51226-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Puppets have been used since the earliest times to animate and communicate the ideas and needs of human societies.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Dugan, E.A., ''Emotions in Motion''.&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians claim that they pre-date actors in theatre.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} There is evidence that they were used in [[Egypt]] as early as 2000 BCE when string-operated figures of wood were manipulated to perform the action of kneading bread.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Wire controlled, articulated puppets made of clay and [[ivory]] have also been found in Egyptian tombs.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} [[Hieroglyphs]] also describe "walking statues" being used in ancient [[Egypt]]ian religious dramas.&lt;ref name="blumenthal"/&gt; Puppetry was practiced in [[ancient Greece]] and the oldest written records of puppetry can be found in the works of [[Herodotus]] and [[Xenophon]], dating from the 5th century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, [[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]], 2.48, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:abo:tlg,0016,001:2:48&amp;lang=original on Perseus]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon, [[Symposium (Xenophon)|Symposium]], 4.55, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:abo:tlg,0032,004:4:55&amp;lang=original on Perseus]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Logan, David, ''Puppetry'', p.7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Africa===
Sub-Saharan Africa may have inherited some of the puppet traditions of ancient Egypt.&lt;ref name="blumenthal"/&gt; Certainly, secret societies in many African ethnic groups still use puppets (and [[masks]]) in ritual dramas as well as in their healing and hunting ceremonies.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Today, puppetry continues as a popular form, often within a ceremonial context, and as part of a wide range of folk forms including dance, storytelling, and [[mask|masked performance]].{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} In the 2010s throughout rural Africa, puppetry still performs the function of transmitting cultural values and ideas that in large African cities is increasingly undertaken by formal education, books, cinema, and television.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

=== Asia ===

====East, Southeast and South Asia====
[[File:Traditional Burmese Commandar-in-chief Marionette.JPG|thumb|Traditional Burmese "commander-in-chief" marionette character]]
There is slight evidence for puppetry in the [[Indus Valley Civilization]]. Archaeologists have unearthed one terracotta doll with a detachable head capable of manipulation by a string dating to 2500 BC.&lt;ref name=G-m-b-14&gt;Ghosh, Massey, and Banerjee, page 14&lt;/ref&gt; Another figure is a terracotta monkey which could be manipulated up and down a stick, achieving minimum animation in both cases.&lt;ref name=G-m-b-14/&gt; The epic ''[[Mahabharata]]'', [[Tamil literature]] from the [[Tamil Sangams|Sangam Era]], and various literary works dating from the late centuries BC to the early centuries AD, including [[edicts of Ashoka|Ashokan edicts]], describe puppets.&lt;ref name=G-m-b-14-15&gt;Ghosh, Massey, and Banerjee, pp.14-15&lt;/ref&gt; Works like the ''[[Natya Shastra]]'' and the ''[[Kamasutra]]'' elaborate on puppetry in some detail.&lt;ref name=G-m-b-15-16&gt;Ghosh, Massey, and Banerjee, pages 15-16&lt;/ref&gt;

The Javanese ''[[Wayang]]'' theater was influenced by [[India]]n traditions.&lt;ref name=Bell-puppet-46&gt;Bell, page 46&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars trace the origin of puppets to India 4000 years ago, where the main character in [[Sanskrit]] plays was known as "Sutradhara",  "the holder of strings".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; ''Wayang'' is a strong tradition of puppetry native of [[Indonesia]], especially in [[Java]] &amp; [[Bali]]. In [[Java]], [[Wayang Kulit Indonesia|wayang kulit]], an elaborate form of shadow puppetry is very popular. Javanese rod puppets have a long history and are used to tell fables from Javanese history. Another popular puppetry form in Indonesia is [[Wayang golek]].

China has a history of puppetry dating back 3000 years, originally in "pi-yung xi", the "theatre of the lantern shadows", or, as it is more commonly known today, [[Shadow theatre|Chinese shadow theatre]]. By the [[Song Dynasty]] (960–1279 AD), puppets played to all social classes including the courts, yet puppeteers, as in Europe, were considered to be from a lower social stratum.&lt;ref name="blumenthal"/&gt;
In [[Taiwan]], [[budaixi]] puppet shows, somewhat similar to the Japanese Bunraku, occur with puppeteers working in the background or underground. Some very experienced puppeteers can manipulate their puppets to perform various stunts, for example, [[somersault]]s in the air.

[[Japan]] has many forms of puppetry, including the [[bunraku]]. Bunraku developed out of Shinto temple rites and gradually became a highly sophisticated form of puppetry. [[Chikamatsu Monzaemon]], considered by many to be Japan's greatest playwright, gave up writing Kabuki plays and focused exclusively on the puppet-only Bunraku plays. Initially consisting of one puppeteer, by 1730 three puppeteers were used to operate each puppet in full view of the audience.&lt;ref name="blumenthal"/&gt; The puppeteers, who dressed all in black, would become invisible when standing against a black background, while the torches illuminated only the carved, painted and costumed wooden puppets.

[[Image:Rajasthani-puppeteer.jpg|thumb|Puppeteer from [[Rajasthan]] (India)]]
In [[Korea]], the tradition of puppetry is thought to have come from China. The oldest historical evidence of puppetry in Korea comes from a letter written in 982 A.D. from Choe Seung-roe to the King.&lt;ref name="sangsu"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nirc.nanzan-u.ac.jp/nfile/768|author=Sang-su, Choe|title=A Study of the Korean Puppet Play|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Korean, the word for puppet is "Kkoktugakshi".&lt;ref name="sangsu"/&gt; "Gagsi" means a "bride" or a "young woman", which was the most common form the dolls took. A [[Kkoktugakshi Nori|kkoktugakshi puppet play]] has eight scenes.&lt;ref name="sangsu"/&gt;

[[Thailand]] has [[Hun Krabok]], a rod puppet theatre which is the most popular form of puppetry.

[[Vietnam]] developed the art form of [[water puppetry]], that is unique to that country. The puppets are built out of wood and the shows are performed in a waist high pool. A large rod under the water is used by the puppeteers to support and control the puppets. The appearance is created of the puppets moving over water. The origin of this form of puppetry dates back seven hundred years when the rice fields would flood and the villagers would entertain each other, eventually resulting in puppet show competitions between villages. This led to puppet societies becoming secretive and exclusive.

====India====
{{Main|Puppetry in India}}
India has a long tradition of puppetry. In the ancient Indian epic ''[[Mahabharata]]'' there are references to puppets. The [[Rajasthani Puppet]] from India is notable and there are many Indian ventriloquists and puppeteers. The first Indian ventriloquist, Professor Y.K. Padhye, introduced this form of puppetry to India in the 1920s and his son, [[Ramdas Padhye]], subsequently popularised ventriloquism and puppetry. Almost all types of puppets are found in India.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ccrtindia.gov.in/puppetforms.php|title=Centre for Cultural Resources and Training (CCRT)|website=ccrtindia.gov.in|access-date=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;String puppets
[[File:Sakhi Kandhei (String puppets of Odisha) at Raja Dinkar Kelkar Museum, Pune.JPG|thumb|Sakhi Kandhei (String puppets of Odisha)]]
India has a rich and ancient tradition of string puppets or marionettes. Marionettes having jointed limbs controlled by strings allow far greater flexibility and are, therefore, the most articulate of the puppets. Rajasthan, Orissa, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu are some of the regions where this form of puppetry has flourished. The traditional marionettes of Rajasthan are known as Kathputli. Carved from a single piece of wood, these puppets are like large dolls that are colourfully dressed.  The string puppets of Orissa are known as Kundhei. The string puppets of Karnataka are called Gombeyatta. Puppets from Tamil Nadu, known as Bommalattam combine the techniques of both rod and string puppets.

;Shadow puppets
[[File:Tholpava koothu shadow puppet back stage (1).jpg|thumb|Tholpavakoothu (Kerala)]]
India has a variety of types and styles of shadow puppets. Shadow puppets are flat figures cut out of leather, which has been treated to make it translucent. Shadow puppets are pressed against the screen with a strong source of light behind it. The manipulation between the light and the screen make silhouettes or colourful shadows, as the case may be, for the viewers who sit in front of the screen. This tradition of shadow puppets survives in Orissa. Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. [[Tholpavakoothu]] (or Tolpava Koothu) is a tradition of [[shadow puppetry]] that is unique to [[Kerala]], [[India]].  The shadow theatre of Karnataka is known as Togalu Gombeyatta. These puppets are mostly small in size. The puppets however differ in size according to their social status, for instance, large size for kings and religious characters and smaller size for common people or servants.

;Rod puppets
Rod puppets are an extension of glove-puppets, but often much larger and supported and manipulated by rods from below. This form of puppetry now is found mostly in West Bengal and Orissa. The traditional rod puppet form of West Bengal is known as Putul Nautch. They are carved from wood and follow the various artistic styles of a particular region. The traditional rod puppet of Bihar is known as Yampuri. 
;Glove puppets
Glove puppets, are also known as sleeve, hand or palm puppets. The head is made of either papier mache, cloth or wood, with two hands emerging from just below the neck. The rest of the figure consists of a long flowing skirt. These puppets are like limp dolls, but in the hands of an able puppeteer, are capable of producing a wide range of movements. The manipulation technique is simple the movements are controlled by the human hand the first finger inserted in the head and the middle finger and the thumb are the two arms of the puppet. With the help of these three fingers, the glove puppet comes alive.

The tradition of glove puppets in India is popular in Uttar Pradesh, Orissa, West Bengal and Kerala. In Uttar Pradesh, glove puppet plays usually present social themes, whereas in Orissa such plays are based on stories of Radha and Krishna. In Orissa, the puppeteer plays on the ''dholak''with one hand and manipulates the puppet with the other. The delivery of the dialogues, the movement of the puppet and the beat of the dholak are well synchronised and create a dramatic atmosphere. In Kerala, the traditional glove puppet play is called Pavakoothu.

[[Afghanistan]] has produced a form of puppetry known as [[buz-baz]].  During a performance a puppeteer will simultaneously operate a marionette of a [[markhor]] while playing a [[dambura]].

[[Image:Karagoez davulcu.jpg|110px|thumb|right|Karagoz, Turkish shadow puppetry]]
Middle Eastern puppetry, like its other theatre forms, is influenced by the Islamic culture. [[Karagoz]], the Turkish Shadow Theatre, has widely influenced puppetry in the region and it is thought to have passed from China by way of India. Later, it was taken by the [[Mongols]] from the Chinese and passed to the Turkish peoples of Central Asia. The art of Shadow Theater was brought to [[Anatolia]] by the Turkish people emigrating from Central Asia. Other scholars claim that shadow theater came to Anatolia in the 16th century from [[Egypt]]. The advocates of this view claim that shadow theatre found its way into the Ottoman palaces when [[Selim I|Yavuz Sultan Selim]] conquered Egypt in 1517. He saw shadow theatre performed during a party in his honour and he was said to be so impressed with it that he took the puppeteer back to his palace in [[Istanbul]] where his 21-year -old son, later Sultan [[Suleyman the Magnificent]], developed an interest in the plays.&lt;ref&gt;Mutlu, Hayali Mustafa, ''Tradition Folk The Site''&lt;/ref&gt;

In other areas, the style of shadow puppetry known as ''khayal al-zill'', a [[metaphor]] translated as "shadows of the imagination" or "shadow of fancy", still survives. This is a shadow play with live music, "the accompaniment of drums, tambourines and flutes...also..."special effects" – smoke, fire, thunder, rattles, squeaks, thumps, and whatever else might elicit a laugh or a shudder from his audience"&lt;ref&gt;Feeney, John, ''Saudi Aramco World'' (article), 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Iran]], puppets are known to have existed much earlier than 1000 AD, but initially only glove and string puppets were popular .&lt;ref&gt;Floor, Willem, ''The History of Theater in Iran'', {{ISBN|0-934211-29-9}}: Mage 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Other genres of puppetry emerged during the [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] era (18th and 19th centuries) as influences from Turkey spread to the region. ''Kheimeh Shab-Bazi'' is a traditional Persian puppet show which is performed in a small chamber by a musical performer and a [[storytelling|storyteller]] called a ''morshed'' or ''naghal''. These shows often take place alongside storytelling in traditional tea and coffee-houses (''Ghahve-Khane''). The dialogue takes place between the morshed and the puppets.&lt;ref&gt;Mehr News Agency, [http://www.mehrnews.com www.mehrnews.com], 7 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; A recent example of puppetry in Iran is the touring opera ''[[Rostam and Sohrab (opera)|Rostam and Sohrab]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Iran Daily'' [http://www.iran-daily.com www.iran-daily.com], 1 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Expert needed|Theatre|section|reason=fails to discuss when puppetry (as theatre) began to appear in Europe|date=May 2018}}

====Ancient Greece and Rome====
[[File:5016 - Archaeological Museum, Athens - Dolls - Photo by Giovanni Dall'Orto, Nov 13 2009.jpg|thumb|Ancient Greek terracotta puppet dolls, 5th/4th century BC, [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens]]]]
Although there are few remaining examples of puppets from [[ancient Greece]], historical literature and archaeological findings shows the existence of puppetry. The [[Greek language|Greek]] word translated as "puppet" is "νευρόσπαστος" (''nevrospastos''), which literally means "drawn by strings, string-pulling",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dneuro%2Fspastos νευρόσπαστος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; from "νεῦρον" (''nevron''), meaning either "sinew, tendon, muscle, string", or "wire",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dneu%3Dron νεῦρον], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; and "σπάω" (''spaō''), meaning "draw, pull".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dspa%2Fw σπάω], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/resolveform?type=start&amp;lookup=neurospast&amp;lang=greek List of Ancient Greek words related to puppetry], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle]] referred to pulling strings to control heads, hands and eyes, shoulders and legs.&lt;ref&gt;Mulholland, John, ''Practical Puppetry'', p.9&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plato]]'s work also contains references to puppetry. The ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'' were presented using puppetry. The roots of European puppetry probably extend back to the Greek plays with puppets played to the "common people" in the 5th century BC. By the 3rd century BC these plays would appear in the Theatre of [[Dionysus]] at the [[Acropolis]].&lt;ref name="blumenthal"/&gt;

In ancient Greece and [[ancient Rome]] clay dolls, and a few of ivory, dated from around 500 BC, were found in children's tombs. These dolls had articulated arms and legs, and in some cases an iron rod extending up from the tops of their heads. This rod was used to manipulate the doll from above, as it is done today in Sicilian puppetry. A few of these dolls had strings in place of rods. Some researchers believe these ancient figures were simply toys and not puppets, due to their small size.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sagecraft.com/puppetry/definitions/historical/chapter1.html Observations - Chapter One&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alcamo-Pupi-bjs2007-01.jpg|Sicilian Puppet Theatre|thumb|right]]

====Italy====
;Middle Ages and Renaissance
Italy is considered by many to be the early home of the marionette due to the influence of Roman puppetry. [[Xenophon]] and [[Plutarch]] refer to them.&lt;ref name="Binyon"&gt;Binyon, Helen, ''Puppetry Today'', p.11&lt;/ref&gt; The Christian church used marionettes to perform [[morality plays]].&lt;ref name="Binyon"/&gt; It is believed that the word '''[[marionette]]''' originates from the little figures of the [[Virgin Mary]], hence the word "marionette" or "Mary doll.&lt;ref&gt;Beaton, Mabel &amp; Les, ''Marionettes: A Hobby for Everyone''.&lt;/ref&gt; Comedy was introduced to the plays as time went by, and ultimately led to a church edict banning puppetry. Puppeteers responded by setting up stages outside cathedrals and became even more [[ribald]] and [[slapstick]]. Out of this grew the Italian comedy called [[Commedia dell'arte]]. Puppets were used at times in this form of theatre and sometimes [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s plays were performed using marionettes instead of actors.&lt;ref&gt;Suib, Leonard Broadman, Muriel, ''Marionettes Onstage!'', p.ix&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Sicily]], the sides of donkey carts are decorated with intricate, painted scenes from the Frankish romantic poems, such as ''[[The Song of Roland]]''. These same tales are enacted in traditional puppet theatres featuring hand-made marionettes of wood. In Sicilian this is called "[[Opera dei pupi]]", or "Opera of the puppets". The "Opera dei pupi" and the Sicilian tradition of cantastorie, the word for storyteller, are rooted in the [[troubadour|Provençal troubadour tradition]], in Sicily during the reign of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]], in the first half of the 13th century.

;18th and 19th centuries
The 18th century was a vital period in the development of all Italian theatre, including the marionette theatre. The rod puppet was mainly of lower-class origin, but the marionette theatre was popular in [[aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] circles, as a celebration of the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. The effects, and the artful and complex construction of the puppets, the puppet theatres, and the puppet narratives, were all popular, particularly in Venice.&lt;ref&gt;Signorelli, Collezione Maria,  [http://www.collezionemariasignorelli.it/inglese_01_inizio.htm www.collezionemariasignorelli.it].&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, the marionettes of [[Pietro Radillo]] became more complex and instead of just the rod and two strings, Radillo's marionettes were controlled by as many as eight strings, which increased control over the individual body parts of the marionettes.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

====France====
[[Guignol]] is the main character in the French puppet show which has come to bear his name. Although often thought of as children's entertainment, Guignol's sharp wit and linguistic verve have always been appreciated by adults as well, as shown by the motto of a prominent [[Lyon]] troupe: "Guignol amuses children… and witty adults". [[Laurent Mourguet]], Guignol's creator, fell on hard times during the French Revolution, and in 1797 started to practice [[dentistry]], which in those days was simply the pulling of teeth. To attract patients, he started setting up a puppet show in front of his dentist's chair.
[[File:Guignol de Lyon.JPG|thumb|Guignol de Lyon]]

His first shows featured [[Pulcinella|Polichinelle]], a character borrowed from the Italian [[commedia dell'arte]]. By 1804 the success was such that he gave up dentistry altogether and became a professional puppeteer, creating his own scenarios drawing on the concerns of his working-class audience and improvising references to the news of the day. He developed characters closer to the daily lives of his Lyon audience, first Gnafron, a wine-loving cobbler, and in 1808 Guignol. Other characters, including Guignol's wife Madelon and the [[Gendarmerie|gendarme]] Flagéolet soon followed, but these are never much more than foils for the two heroes. Guignol's inevitable victory is always the triumph of good over evil.

====Great Britain====
[[File:Burattini ca 1770.jpg|British Puppet theatre (Punch and Judy style), c. 1770|thumb|right]]
The traditional British ''[[Punch and Judy]]'' puppetry traces its roots to the 16th century to the Italian [[commedia dell'arte]].&lt;ref name="binyon"&gt;Binyon, Helen, ''Puppetry Today'', p.36&lt;/ref&gt; The character of "Punch" derives from the character [[Pulcinella]], which was Anglicized to ''Punchinello''. He is a manifestation of the [[Lord of Misrule]] and [[Trickster]], figures of deep-rooted mythologies. Punch's wife was originally "Joan", but later became "Judy". In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the familiar ''Punch and Judy'' puppet show which existed in Britain was performed in an easily transportable [[:wikt:booth|booth]]. The British Puppet and Model Theatre Guild in the early 20th century instigated a resurgence of puppetry. Two of the Guild's founders, H. W. Whanslaw and [[Waldo Lanchester]], both worked to promote and develop puppetry with publications of books and literature, mainly focusing on the art of the marionette. Lanchester had a touring theatre and a permanent venue in [[Malvern, Worcestershire]], regularly taking part in the Malvern Festival and attracting the attention of [[George Bernard Shaw]]. One of Shaw's last plays, ''[[Shakes versus Shav]]'', was written for and first performed in 1949 by the company.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

From 1957-1969, [[Gerry Anderson]] produced many television series starring marionettes, starting with [[Roberta Leigh]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Twizzle]]'' and ending with ''[[The Secret Service]]''. Many of these series (the most famous of which was ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'') employed a technique called [[Supermarionation]], which automatically synchronized the pre-recorded character dialogue to the puppets' mouth movements. Anderson returned to puppetry in 1983 with ''[[Terrahawks]]'' and the unaired [[Pilot episode|pilot]] ''[[Space Precinct#Pilot|Space Police]]'' in 1987.

Current British puppetry theatres include the [[Little Angel Theatre]] in [[Islington]], London, [[Puppet Theatre Barge]] in London, [[Norwich Puppet Theatre]], the [[Harlequin Puppet Theatre]], [[Rhos-on-Sea]], Wales, and the Biggar Puppet Theatre, [[Biggar, Lanarkshire]], [[Scotland]]. British puppetry now covers a wide range of styles and approaches. [[Don Austen]], a British puppeteer, worked with [[Jim Henson's Creature Shop]], and also worked on a number of feature films. There are also a number of British theatre companies, including [[Horse and Bamboo Theatre]], and [[Green Ginger]], which integrate puppetry into highly visual productions. From 1984 to 1996, puppetry was used as a vehicle for political [[satire]] in the British television series ''[[Spitting Image]]''. Puppetry has also been influencing mainstream theatre, and several recent productions combine puppetry with live action, including ''[[War Horse (play)|Warhorse]]'', at the [[Royal National Theatre]] and ''[[Madama Butterfly|Madam Butterfly]]'' at the [[English National Opera]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

====Netherlands, Denmark, Romania, and Russia====
Many regional variants of Pulcinella were developed as the character spread across Europe. In the Netherlands it is ''Jan Klaassen'' (and Judy is ''Katrijn''); in Denmark ''Mester Jackel''; in Russia ''Petrushka''; and in Romania ''Vasilache''. In Russia, the Central Puppet Theatre in Moscow and its branches in every part of the country enhanced the reputation of the puppeteer and puppetry in general.&lt;ref&gt;''Practical Puppetry''/John Mullholland, p.10&lt;/ref&gt;

====Germany and Austria====
There is a long tradition of puppetry in Germany and Austria. Much of it derives from the 16th century tradition of the Italian [[commedia dell'arte]].&lt;ref name="binyon"/&gt; The German version of the British character of 'Punch' is called [[Kasperle]] of Kaspar while Judy is called [[Grete]].&lt;ref name="binyon"/&gt; In the 18th century, operas were specifically composed for marionette puppets. [[Gluck]], [[Haydn]],&lt;ref&gt;''Practical Puppetry''/John Mulholland, p.9&lt;/ref&gt; [[de Falla]] and [[Ottorino Respighi|Respighi]] all composed adult operas for marionettes.

In 1855, [[Count Franz Pocci]] founded the [[Münchner Marionettentheater|Munich Marionette Theatre]]. A German dramatist, poet, painter and composer, Pocci wrote 40 puppet plays for his theatre. [[Albrecht Roser]] has made a considerable impact with his marionettes in [[Stuttgart]]. His characters ''Clown Gustaf'' and ''Grandmother'' are well-known.&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete Book of Puppets'' by David Currell, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; ''Grandmother'', while outwardly charming, is savagely humorous in her observations about all aspects of society and the absurdities of life.

In [[Lindau]], [[Lindauer Marionettenoper|the Lindau Marionette Opera]] was founded in 2000 by [[Bernard Leismueller]] and [[Ralf Hechelmann]]. The company performs a large number of operas as well as a marionette ballet, ''[[Swan Lake]]''.

In Augsburg, the historic [[Augsburger Puppenkiste|Augsburg Marionette Theatre]] was founded in 1943 by [[Walter Oehmichen]]. It continues to this day along with an adjoining puppet museum under the grandsons of the founder, [[Klaus Marschall]] and [[Juergen Marschall]].

Much earlier in nearby [[Salzburg]], Austria, the [[Salzburg Marionette Theatre]] was founded in 1913 by Professor [[Anton Aicher]] and is world-famous. The Salzburg Marionette Theatre still continues the tradition of presenting full-length opera using marionettes in their own purpose built theatre until recently under the direction of [[Gretl Aicher]]. It performs mainly operas such as ''[[Die Fledermaus]]'' and ''[[The Magic Flute]]'' and a small number of ballets such as ''[[The Nutcracker]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete Book of Puppet Theatre'' by David Currell, p.12&lt;/ref&gt; The Salzburg Marionette Theatre productions are aimed for adults although children are of course welcome.

There is also a marionette theatre at Schoenbrunn Palace in Vienna.

====Czech Republic====
Marionette puppet theatre has had a very long history in entertainment in [[Prague]], and elsewhere in the Czech Republic. It can be traced deep into the early part of the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name="dubska"&gt;''Czech Puppet Theatre'' by Alice Dubska, Jan Novak, Nina Malikova and Marie Zdenkova, p.6&lt;/ref&gt; Marionettes first appeared around the time of the Thirty Years' War.&lt;ref name="dubska"/&gt; The first noted Czech puppeteer was Jan Jiri Brat, who was born in 1724. He was the son of a local carpenter and created his own puppet theatre.&lt;ref name="dubska"/&gt; Matej Kopecky was the most famous 19th-century Czech puppeteer,&lt;ref name="dubska"/&gt; and was responsible for communicating the ideas of national awareness.&lt;ref name="dubska"/&gt;

In 1920 and 1926 respectively, [[Josef Skupa]] created his most famous puppet characters: comical father [[Spejbl]] and his rascal son [[Hurvínek]].&lt;ref&gt;''Practical Puppetry''/John Mulholland, p.19&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930, he set up the first modern professional puppet theatre{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}. An important puppet organisation is the [[National Marionette Theatre]] in Prague. Its repertoire mainly features a marionette production of [[Mozart]]'s opera ''[[Don Giovanni]]''. The production has period costumes and 18th-century setting. There are numerous other companies, including Buchty a Loutky ("Cakes and Puppets"), founded by [[Marek Bečka]].&lt;ref name="dubska"/&gt; Puppets have been used extensively in animated films since 1946.&lt;ref name="dubska"/&gt; [[Jiří Trnka]] was an acknowledged leader in this area.&lt;ref name="dubska"/&gt; [[Miroslav Trejtnar]] is a master puppeteer and teacher of traditional Czech marionette-making skills.&lt;ref&gt;Puppets in Prague, www.puppetsinprague.eu&lt;/ref&gt;

====19th century====
Throughout this period, puppetry developed separately from the emerging mainstream of actor theatres, and the 'ragged' puppeteers performed outside of theatre buildings at fairs, markets etc. - continuing to be classified along with bandits and gypsies.&lt;ref name="blumenthal"/&gt; In the 19th century, puppetry faced competition from other forms of theatre such as [[vaudeville]] and [[music hall]], but it adapted to these challenges, for example: by developing stage acts and participating in the new forms of popular theatre, or reinventing itself in other ways and finding audiences at the newly fashionable seaside resorts.

===North America===
The [[Teotihuacan]] culture (Central Mexico) of 600 AD made figurines with moveable arms and legs as part of their funerary rites. [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] also used ceremonial puppets.&lt;ref name="blumenthal"/&gt;
In 1519, two puppeteers accompanied [[Hernando Cortez]] on his first journey to Mexico. Europeans brought their own puppet traditions with them, but gradually distinctive styles, forms and puppet characters developed in [[North America]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

During the Depression, folk puppeteers traveled with carnivals,  working with their own scripts and with dioramas and marionettes of their own manufacture.

Some advances in 20th-century puppetry have originated in the [[United States]]. Marionette puppetry was combined with television as early as the 1940s, with [[Howdy Doody]] of the United States being a notable marionette in this field. [[Bil Baird]] worked on revitalising marionette theatre and puppetry in the United States. He and his wife, [[Cora Eisenberg]] had their own marionette theatre in New York. [[Ventriloquist]], [[Edgar Bergen]] also made a major contribution.&lt;ref&gt;Funni, Arthur, ''The Radio Years of Bergen and McCarthy'' (Thesis)&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s Peter Schumann's [[Bread and Puppet Theater]] developed the political and artistic possibilities of puppet theatre in a distinctive, powerful and immediately recognizable way. At roughly the same time, [[Jim Henson]] was creating a type of soft, foam-rubber and cloth puppet which became known collectively as [[The Muppets|Muppets]]. Initially, through the children's television show ''[[Sesame Street]]'', and later in ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' and on film, these inspired many imitators and are today are recognised almost everywhere. [[Wayland Flowers]] also made a major contribution to adult puppetry with his satirical puppet, [[Madame]].

[[Sid and Marty Krofft]] are two of Americas most well known puppeteers and were mainly known for their live action children's TV series in the 60s and 70s namely [[HR Puffinstuff]] and [[Lidsville]]

Puppets also have been used in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' films, notably with the character of [[Yoda]]. His voice and manipulation was provided by [[Frank Oz]].

===Australia===
The [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] peoples of Australia have a long tradition of oral storytelling which goes back many thousands of years. They used masks and other objects to convey deep and meaningful themes about morality and nature. Masks were carved from wood and heavily decorated with paint and feathers.

In Australia in the 1960s, [[Peter Scriven]] founded the [[Marionette Theatre of Australia]] and had beautiful marionette productions such as [[The Tintookies]], [[Little Fella Bindi]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=163386&amp;search=sad&amp;images=&amp;c=1&amp;s= 98/25/2 Marionette puppet, 'Tintookies Little Fella Bindi', Aboriginal figure, papier mache / wood / cotton / felt / feathers / metal, designed by Colin Garland for the Marionette Theatre of Australia, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, 1958-1977 - Powerhouse Museum Collection&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Explorers]] and [[The Water-Babies, A Fairy Tale for a Land Baby|The Water Babies]]. Bilbar Puppet Theatre, established by [[Barbara Turnbull]] and her husband [[Bill Turnbull (puppeteer)]] toured Australia extensively under the auspices of the [[Queensland Arts Council]] in the 1970s and 1980s. Their puppets are now held at the [[Queensland Performing Arts Centre]], [[Brisbane]]. [[David Poulton]] toured marionette shows via the Queensland Arts Council along his 'Strings and Things' with his wife Sally for many years from the late 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;'Stutter leads to lifetime with puppets', Sunshine Coast Daily, 10 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Hamilton (puppeteer)|David Hamilton]], one of the last remaining marionette puppeteers in Australia, tours independently and formerly toured under the auspices of the Queensland Arts Council. Comedian and radio broadcaster [[Jamie Dunn]] was famous for his Muppet-style character, [[Agro (puppet)]] who featured on several [[Seven Network]] television programs throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Formally trained in the [[United States]] by puppeteers from the [[Jim Henson|Jim Henson Company]], [[Brett Hansen]] and his [[Brisbane]] based [[Larrikin Puppets]] company is one of only a few Muppet-style puppeteers actively performing in Australia. [[Cabaret Puppet Theatre]], based in Brisbane's Redlands area, also tours with productions for children and adults.&lt;ref&gt;Cabaret Puppet Theatre www.cabaretpuppettheatre.com&lt;/ref&gt; In Melbourne [[Handspan Theatre]] 1977-2002 evolved from humble collective beginnings to evolve a design-rich large theatre format dubbed 'Visual Theatre' and became a hot-house for innovative projects and award-winning multimedia collaborations within Australia and around the world.

[[File:Snuff-scarey-skullies.jpg|[[Snuff Puppets]] Skullies from Scarey|thumb|right]]
A post-graduate course existed at the [[Victorian College of the Arts]], [[University of Melbourne]] in the late 1990s. Australian puppeteer [[Norman Hetherington]] was famous for his marionette, [[Mr. Squiggle]] who featured on an Australian Broadcasting Commission television program for many years from 1 July 1959. The last episode was on 9 July 1999. In every episode he would create several pictures from "squiggles" sent in by children from around the country. [[Richard Bradshaw OAM]] is another famous Australian puppeteer. He is a past President of [[UNIMA Australia]], former artistic director of the Marionette Theatre Company of Australia&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete Book of Puppet Theatre'' by David Currell, p.50&lt;/ref&gt; and does shadow puppetry and writing in the field.

[[Rod Hull]] also made a contribution with his puppet [[Emu (puppet)|Emu]]. In the 1960s, Hull presented a children's breakfast television programme in Australia. [[Snuff Puppets]] is one of Australia's modern puppet theatre troupes. Based in [[Melbourne]], their work is full of wild black humour, political and sexual satire and a hand made visually aesthetic. Snuff Puppets has performed in over 15 countries, including tours to major festivals in Asia, South America and Europe. There is an annual winter festival of puppets at the City of Melbourne's ArtPlay and at Federation Square in Melbourne.

From early in the 19th century, puppetry began to inspire artists from the 'high-art' traditions. In 1810, [[Heinrich von Kleist]] wrote an essay 'On the Marionette Theatre', admiring the "lack of self-consciousness" of the puppet. Puppetry developed throughout the 20th century in a variety of ways. Supported by the parallel development of cinema, television and other filmed media it now reaches a larger audience than ever. Another development, starting at the beginning of the century, was the belief that puppet theatre, despite its popular and folk roots, could speak to adult audiences with an adult, and experimental voice, and reinvigorate the high art tradition of actors' theatre.&lt;ref&gt;''Strings, Hands, Shadows: A Modern Puppet History''/John Bell/Chapter 6/Detroit Institute of Art/2000 {{ISBN|0-89558-156-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Puppets, a 2002 photo of a lithograph from xerographic direct imaging of two 20th century hand puppets.png|thumb|Puppets, a 2002 photo of a lithograph from xerographic direct imaging of two 20th century hand puppets]]

[[Sergei Obraztsov]] explored the concept of ''kukolnost'' ('puppetness'), despite [[Joseph Stalin]]'s insistence on realism.
Other pioneers, including [[Edward Gordon Craig]] and [[Erwin Piscator]] were influenced by puppetry in their crusade to regalvanise the mainstream. [[Maeterlinck]], [[George Bernard Shaw|Shaw]], [[Federico García Lorca|Lorca]] and others wrote puppet plays, and artists such as [[Picasso]], [[Alfred Jarry|Jarry]], and [[Fernand Léger|Léger]] began to work in theatre.&lt;ref name="blumenthal"/&gt; Craig's concept of the "übermarionette"&amp;mdash;in which the director treats the actors like objects&amp;mdash;has been highly influential on contemporary "object theatre" and "[[physical theatre]]".{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} [[Tadeusz Kantor]] frequently substituted actors for puppets, or combined the two, and conducted each performance from the edge of the stage, in some ways similar to a puppeteer.

Kantor influenced a new formalist generation of directors such as [[Richard Foreman]] and [[Robert Wilson (director)|Robert Wilson]] who were concerned with the 'object' in theatrical terms "putting it on stage and finding different ways of looking at it" (Foreman). Innovatory puppeteers such as [[Tony Sarg]], Waldo Lanchester, John Wright, [[Bil Baird]], Joan Baixas, Sergei Obratsov, Philipe Genty, [[Peter Schumann]], [[Dattatreya Aralikatte]], [[Jim Henson]], [[Dadi Pudumjee]], and [[Julie Taymor]] have also continued to develop the forms and content of puppetry, so that the phrase 'puppet theatre' is no longer limited to traditional forms of marionettes, glove, or rod puppets. Directors and companies like Peter Schumann of [[Bread and Puppet Theatre]], Bob Frith of [[Horse and Bamboo Theatre]], and Sandy Speiler of [[In the Heart of the Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre]] have also combined mask and puppet theatre where the performer, puppets and objects are integrated within a largely visual theatre world that minimises the use of spoken language.&lt;ref&gt;''Experimental Theatre, from Stanislavsky to Peter Brook''/James Roose-Evans, 1970 Studio Vista {{ISBN|0-415-00963-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Jim Henson Foundation]], founded by puppeteer and [[Muppet]] creator [[Jim Henson]], is a philanthropic, charitable organization created to promote and develop puppetry in the United States.

'''''Purity of Diction in English Verse''''' was written by [[Donald Davie]] and first published by [[Chatto &amp; Windus]] in 1952.  It was Davie's first book, and was followed three years later by a sequel: ''[[Articulate Energy]].''  In 1992 Penguin published both books together in a single volume with a new foreword.  

The book was written for the most part in [[Plymouth]], and Davie put into it much of what he had learned at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7545">The '''right of reply''' generally means the right to defend oneself against public criticism in the same venue where it was published. In some countries, such as Brazil, it is a legal or even constitutional right. In other countries, it is not a legal right as such, but a right which certain media outlets and publications choose to grant to people who have been severely criticised by them, as a matter of editorial policy.

==By Law==

===Brazil===
The [[Brazilian Constitution]] guarantees the right of reply (''direito de resposta'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Constituicao/Constituicao.htm] (article 5, V) Retrieved November 12, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===

====European Union====
In Europe, there have been proposals for a legally enforceable right of reply that applies to all [[mass media|media]], including [[newspapers]], [[magazines]], and other print media, along with [[radio]], [[television]], and the [[internet]]. In 1974, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe already voted a resolution granting a right of reply to all individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=09000016805048e1 |title=Resolution of the Committee of Ministers on the Right of Reply|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 1 of a 2004 [[Council of Europe]] recommendation defined a right of reply as: ''offering a possibility to react to any information in the media presenting inaccurate facts &amp;hellip; which affect &amp;hellip; personal rights''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://search.coe.int/cm/Pages/result_details.aspx?ObjectID=09000016805db3b6 |title=Draft Recommendation of the Committee of Ministers to Member States on the Right of Reply in the New Media Environment}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mediawise.org.uk/display_page.php?id=823 |title=MediaWise submission to DCMS consultation |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060116213940/http://www.mediawise.org.uk/display_page.php?id=823 |archivedate=2006-01-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Individual countries====
In the federal system of [[Germany]], the individual federal states are responsible for education, cultural affairs, and also the press and electronic media. All press laws of the 16 federal states guarantee the right to a counter presentation of factual statements which are deemed to be wrong by the individuals and organisations concerned. This is based on article 11 the national press law of 1874, and is found in all 16 laws as §11 or §10 in slightly modified versions.

[[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]] have similar laws on the book. In Austria this is in article 9 of the national media law, in Switzerland in article 28g of the civil code.

In [[France]], the right to a corrective reply goes back to the [[:fr:loi sur la liberté de la presse du 29 juillet 1881|article 13 of the ''Law on the freedom of the press'' of July 29, 1881]] and is renewed and extended to broadcast and digital media via various laws and decrees.

The [[Belgium|Belgian]] law on the right to reply emerged in 1831 as article 13 of the 1831 decree on the press. This was replaced 130 years later by the law on the ''droit de réponse'' or «loi du 23 juin 1961». Originally referring only to the printed press, this law was amended in 1977 by the law of  «4 mars 1977 relative au droit de réponse dans l’audiovisuel» i.e. audiovisual media, published in the ''Moniteur Belge'' of March 15, 1977.&lt;ref name="RDTI_2007-27"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Obs_Avis-No5"/&gt; Since the federalisation of the Belgian state in 1980, the language communities are responsible for the media, and so the Flemish community has passed in 2005 a decrée dated March 4, 2005, which regulates the right to reply in articles 177 to 199, and the German language community has passed the decree of 27 June 2005, which simply refers to the law of 1961 as amended in 1977.&lt;ref name="RDTI_2007-27"/&gt;{{rp|p.32}}

===United Nations===

The United Nations recognises the "International Right of Correction" through the "Convention on the International Right of Correction", which entered into force on August 24, 1962.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/instree/u1circ.htm Convention on the International Right of Correction, 435 U.N.T.S. 191, entered into force August 24, 1962.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
A Florida right of reply law (referring to print media) was overturned by ''[[Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo]]'', [[Case citation|418 U.S. 241]] (1974), while a FCC policy (referring to broadcast media) was affirmed in ''[[Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC]]'',  [[Case citation|395 U.S. 367]]  (1969).

==By editorial policy==

===BBC===
A right of reply can also be part of the editorial policy of a news publication or an academic journal. The [[BBC]]'s Editorial Guidelines state:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/editorialguidelines/page/guidelines-fairness-right-of-reply/ |title=BBC - Editorial Guidelines - Guidelines - Section 6: Fairness, Contributors and Consent - Right of Reply |author= |date= |work= |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2012-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote style="font-style:italic;"&gt;When our output makes allegations of wrongdoing, iniquity or incompetence or lays out a strong and damaging critique of an individual or institution the presumption is that those criticised should be given a "right of reply", that is, given a fair opportunity to respond to the allegations.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Australasian Journal of Philosophy''===
The ''[[Australasian Journal of Philosophy]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s editorial policy says:&lt;ref&gt;AJP: [http://www.ajp.aap.org.au/editorial-policy.html Editorial Policy] Retrieved August 3, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote style="font-style:italic;"&gt;[A]uthors of the materials being commented on [in Discussion Notes] may be given a right of reply (subject to the usual refereeing), on the understanding that timely publication of the Note will take priority over the desirability of including both Note and Reply in the same issue of the Journal.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Rotating bookmarks''' were a special kind of [[bookmark]] used in medieval Europe. They were attached to a string, along which a marker could be slid up and down to mark a precise level on the page. Attached to the marker was a rotating disk that could indicate the column (usually numbered one to four, indicating the two columns on the left-hand page, and the two columns on the right-hand page).

About 30 such rotating bookmarks have been recorded in libraries in [[continental Europe]], and another half a dozen in England.

'''Spatial justice''' links together [[social justice]] and space, most notably in the works of geographers [[David Harvey]] and [[Edward W. Soja]]. The organization of space is a crucial dimension of human societies and reflects social facts and influences social relations ([[Henri Lefebvre]], 1968, 1972). Consequently, both [[justice]] and injustice become visible in space. Therefore, the analysis of the interactions between space and society is necessary to understand social injustices and to formulate territorial policies aiming at tackling them. It is at this junction that the concept of spatial justice has been developed.

== Social justice ==

According to this political theory, space being a fundamental dimension of human societies, [[social justice]] is embedded in it. So the understanding of interactions between space and societies is essential to the understanding of social injustices and to a reflection on planning policies that aims at reducing them. This reflection can be guided by the concept of spatial justice, which ties Social Justice with space.
Spatial justice is a crucial challenge because it is the ultimate goal of many planning policies. However, the diversity of definitions of "[[Justice]]" (and of the possible "[[social contract]]s" that legitimate them), is high and the political objectives of [[regional planning]] or [[urban planning]] can be quite different and even contradictory.

Therefore, it is important to analyze the concept of spatial justice, which is still rarely questioned (particularly since the work of Anglo-American [[critical geography|radical geographers]] in the 1970s–1980s&lt;ref&gt;See [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]], ''Social Justice and the City'', 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;) to the extent that it has been taken for granted. These past few years, several events and publications have demonstrated the rising interest of human and social sciences for the concept of spatial justice.&lt;ref&gt;A conference investigating the concept of spatial justice was held in March 2008 at the University Paris-Ouest Nanterre, France. Moreover, ''justice spatiale - spatial justice'', a scientific Journal centered on Spatial Justice has been created in 2009: http://jssj.org/. A book focused on Spatial Justice has also been written by [[Edward W. Soja]] in 2010 : 
SOJA Edward W., 2010, ''Seeking Spatial Justice'', Minneapolis, University of Minnesota Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Between issues of redistribution and decision-making processes ==
The concept of spatial justice opens up several perspectives for social sciences. Building on the work of several famous Justice philosophers ([[John Rawls]], 1971; [[Iris Marion Young]], 1990, 2000), two contrasting approaches of justice have polarized the debate: one focuses on redistribution issues, the other concentrates on decision-making processes. 
A first set of approaches consists in asking questions about spatial or socio-spatial distributions and working to achieve an equal geographical distribution of society's wants and needs, such as [[Employment|job opportunities]], [[Health disparities|access to health care]], [[Air Quality Index|good air quality]], et cetera.  This is of particular concern in regions where the population has difficulty moving to a more spatially just location due to poverty, discrimination, or political restrictions (such as apartheid [[pass laws]]).  Even in free, developed nations, access to many places are limited.  Geographer [[Don Mitchell (geographer)|Don Mitchell]] points to the mass [[privatization]] of once-public land as a common example of spatial injustice. In this distributive justice perspective, the access to material and immaterial goods, or to social positions indicates whether the situation is fair or not. At the scale of urban space, questions of accessibility, walkability and transport equity can also be seen as matters of distribution of spatial resources.

Another way of tackling the concept of spatial justice is to focus on decision-making procedures: this approach also raises issues of representations of space, of territorial or other identities and of social practices. For instance, focusing on minorities allows to explore their spatial practices but also to investigate how these are experienced and managed by various agents: this may lead to reveal forms of [[oppression]] or [[discrimination]] that a universalist approach might disregard otherwise.
In sum, depending on the chosen approach, either questions are asked about spatial distributions because justice is evaluated from "results", or questions are asked about space representations, (spatial or not) identities and experiences because justice is defined as a process. Spatial justice stands as a unifying concept for the social sciences: its coherence stems from a reflection on the modalities of the political decision-making and on the policies implemented in order to improve spatial distributions.

== Environmental justice ==
The emergence of the concept of [[sustainable development]] has also fostered a debate on environmental equity. It questions our ontological relationship to the world, and the possibility of a fair policy addressing the needs of mankind, present and future, local and global, and of new forms of governance. The notion of "Environmental Justice" was created in the 1970s–1980s in North American cities to denounce the spatial overlapping between forms of [[racial discrimination]] and social-economic exclusion, industrial pollutions and vulnerability to natural hazards.

'''Stone structures''', or "[[megalith]]s", have been erected by humanity for thousands of years. Many of these structures were built around the same time, the 3rd millennium BC.

Some of the better-known ones:

*[[Easter Island]]
*[[Egyptian Pyramids]]
*[[Medicine wheel]]s
*[[Stone circle]]
*[[Stone circle (Iron Age)]]
*[[Stonehenge]]
*[[Stone ship]]

[[File:TheCuriousRoom.jpg|thumb|Cover of the first edition, published by [[Chatto &amp; Windus]].]]

'''''The Curious Room''''' ({{ISBN|0-09-958621-5}}) is a book collecting various plays and scripts by English writer [[Angela Carter]]. Its full title is '''''The Curious Room: Plays, Film Scripts and an Opera'''''.

The book contains her original screenplays for the films ''[[The Company of Wolves]]'' and ''[[The Magic Toyshop]]'', both of which were based on her own original stories. It also contains a draft of a [[libretto]] for an opera based on ''[[Orlando: A Biography]]'' by [[Virginia Woolf]], and five radio plays: "Vampirella", which she then reworked as "The Lady of the House of Love" in ''[[The Bloody Chamber]]'' collection, "The Company of Wolves", "Puss in Boots" (both reworkings of Charles Perrault's fairy tales) and two "artificial biographies", one of Victorian painter, [[Richard Dadd]], who murdered his father, and the other about Edwardian novelist, [[Ronald Firbank]]. The collection also includes the unproduced screenplays ''Gun for the Devil'' (based upon an earlier short work of hers, collected in ''American Ghosts and Old World Wonders'') and  ''The Christchurch Murders'' (based on the [[Parker–Hulme murder case]] which also influenced the 1994 [[Peter Jackson]] film ''[[Heavenly Creatures]]''), as well a stage adaptation of [[Frank Wedekind]]'s Lulu plays.  Carter's television work also included a controversial documentary entitled ''[[The Holy Family Album]]'', which is not published here.

Edited and with production notes provided by Mark Bell, with an introduction by [[Susannah Clapp]], the book was published by [[Chatto and Windus]] in [[1996 in literature|1996]], four years [[List of works published posthumously|after Angela Carter's death]].

==Subfamily members and relations==

[[Southern Tiwa language|Southern Tiwa]] is spoken in by around 1,600 people in [[Pueblo of Isleta|Isleta Pueblo]], [[Sandia Pueblo]], and [[Ysleta del Sur Pueblo|Ysleta del Sur Pueblo (Tigua Pueblo)]].

The remaining two languages form a subgrouping known as ''Northern Tiwa''. Northern Tiwa consists of [[Taos language|Taos]] spoken by 800 people in [[Taos Pueblo]] and [[Picuris language|Picuris]] spoken by around 220 people in [[Picuris Pueblo, New Mexico|Picuris Pueblo]].

The extinct language of [[Piro Pueblo]] may also have been a Tiwan language, but this is uncertain (see [[Piro Pueblo language]]).

==History==

After the [[Pueblo Revolt]] against the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[conquistador]]s in 1680, some of the Tigua and Piro peoples fled south with the Spanish to El Paso del Norte (present-day [[Ciudad Juárez]], [[Mexico]]).  There they founded Ysleta del Sur, Texas; [[Socorro, Texas]]; and [[Senecu, Mexico|Senecú del Sur]], Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Michael P. and Walt, Henry J., (1984) "Chapter 11: Pre-Revolt Place Names: Senecú," in ''Rio Abajo: Prehistory and History of a Rio Grande Province,'' New Mexico Historic Preservation Division, Santa Fe, p. 252, {{OCLC|11553460}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their descendants live in these communities to this day.&lt;ref&gt;Eickhoff, Randy Lee (1996) ''Exiled: The Tigua Indians of Ysleta del Sur,'' Republic of Texas Press, Plano, Texas, {{ISBN|1-55622-507-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30045">'''Universal grammar''' ('''UG''') in [[linguistics]], is the theory of the [[genetics|genetic]] component of the [[language faculty]], usually credited to [[Noam Chomsky]]. The basic postulate of UG is that a certain set of [[Grammar|structural rules]] are [[A priori and a posteriori|innate]] to humans, independent of [[sensory experience]]. With more linguistic stimuli received in the course of [[psychological development]], children then adopt specific [[syntactic rule]]s that conform to UG.&lt;ref name="toolmodule2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thebrain.mcgill.ca/flash/capsules/outil_rouge06.html|title=Tool Module: Chomsky's Universal Grammar|author=Noam Chomsky|accessdate=2010-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes known as "mental grammar", and stands contrasted with other "grammars", e.g. [[Prescriptive grammar|prescriptive]], [[Descriptive grammar|descriptive]] and [[Pedagogical grammar|pedagogical]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An A-Z of ELT|date=2006|publisher=Macmillan Education|isbn=1-4050-7063-3|page=92|last1=Thornbury|first1=Scott}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04v382j|title=First Words: How do children develop language?|date=16 December 2014|work=BBC Radio 4|department=Word of Mouth|last1=Szendroi|first1=Kriszta|accessdate=24 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advocates of this theory emphasize and partially rely on [[Poverty of the stimulus|the poverty of the stimulus]] (POS) argument and the existence of some universal properties of natural [[human languages]]. However, the latter has not been firmly established, as some linguists have argued languages are so diverse that such universality is rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Evans |first1=Nicholas |last2=Levinson |first2=Stephen C. |title=The myth of language universals: Language diversity and its importance for cognitive science |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |date=26 October 2009 |volume=32 |issue=05 |pages=429-48 |doi=10.1017/S0140525X0999094X |pmid=19857320 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-myth-of-language-universals%3A-language-diversity-Evans-Levinson/1202032fc27b5da12362d82d48eed5e1c34c166f |dead-url=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180727171702/https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1f31/330319b363499ec974b27b7678d96025cde9.pdf |archivedate=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a matter of empirical investigation to determine precisely what properties are universal and what linguistic capacities are innate.

== Argument ==
The theory of universal grammar proposes that if human beings are brought up under normal conditions (not those of extreme [[sensory deprivation]]), then they will always develop language with certain properties (e.g., distinguishing [[noun]]s from [[verb]]s, or distinguishing [[function word]]s from [[content word]]s). The theory proposes that there is an innate, genetically determined language faculty that knows these rules, making it easier and faster for children to learn to speak than it otherwise would be.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thebrain.mcgill.ca/flash/capsules/outil_rouge06.html|title=Tool Module: Chomsky’s Universal Grammar|website=thebrain.mcgill.ca|access-date=2017-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This faculty does not know the vocabulary of any particular language (so words and their meanings must be learned), and there remain several parameters which can vary freely among languages (such as whether adjectives come before or after nouns) which must also be learned.

As Chomsky puts it, "Evidently, development of language in the individual must involve three factors: (1) genetic endowment, which sets limits on the attainable languages, thereby making language acquisition possible; (2) external data, converted to the experience that selects one or another language within a narrow range; (3) principles not specific to the Faculty of Language."&lt;ref name="Chomsky 2007"&gt;{{cite book |last=Chomsky |first=Noam |year=2007 |chapter=Approaching UG from Below |title=Interfaces + Recursion = Language? Chomsky's Minimalism and the View from Syntax-Semantics |series=Studies in Generative Grammar |editor=Hans-Martin Gärtner |editor2=Uli Sauerland |publisher=Mouton de Gruyter |location=Berlin |isbn=978-3-11-018872-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally, aspects of universal grammar seem describable in terms of general details regarding cognition. For example, if a predisposition to categorize events and objects as different classes of things is part of human cognition, and directly results in nouns and verbs showing up in all languages, then it could be assumed that rather than this aspect of universal grammar being specific to language, it is more generally a part of human cognition. To distinguish properties of languages that can be traced to other facts regarding cognition from properties of languages that cannot, the abbreviation UG* can be used. UG is the term often used by Chomsky for those aspects of the human brain which cause language to be the way that it is (i.e. are universal grammar in the sense used here) but here for discussion, it is used for those aspects which are furthermore specific to language (thus UG, as Chomsky uses it, is just an abbreviation for universal grammar, but UG* as used here is a subset of universal grammar).

In the same article, Chomsky casts the theme of a larger research program in terms of the following question: "How little can be attributed to UG while still accounting for the variety of 'I-languages' attained, relying on third factor principles?" (I-languages meaning internal languages, the brain states that correspond to knowing how to speak and understand a particular language, and third factor principles meaning (3) in the previous quote).

Chomsky has speculated that UG might be extremely simple and abstract, for example only a mechanism for combining symbols in a particular way, which he calls "[[Merge (linguistics)|merge]]". The following quote shows that Chomsky does not use the term "UG" in the narrow sense UG* suggested above:

"The conclusion that merge falls within UG holds whether such recursive generation is unique to FL (faculty of language) or is
appropriated from other systems."

In other words, merge is seen as part of UG because it causes language to be the way it is, universal, and is not part of the environment or general properties independent of genetics and environment. Merge is part of universal grammar whether it is specific to language, or whether, as Chomsky suggests, it is also used for an example in mathematical thinking.

The distinction is important because there is a long history of argument about UG*, whereas most people working on language agree that there is universal grammar. Many people assume that Chomsky means UG* when he writes UG (and in some cases he might actually mean UG* [though not in the passage quoted above]).

Some students of universal grammar study a variety of grammars to extract generalizations called [[linguistic universal]]s, often in the form of "If X holds true, then Y occurs." These have been extended to a variety of traits, such as the phonemes found in languages, the word orders which languages choose, and the reasons why children exhibit certain linguistic behaviors.

Later linguists who have influenced this theory include Chomsky and [[Richard Montague]], developing their version of this theory as they considered issues of the [[argument from poverty of the stimulus]] to arise from the constructivist approach to linguistic theory. The application of the idea of universal grammar to the study of second language acquisition (SLA) is represented mainly in the work of McGill linguist [[Lydia White]].

Syntacticians generally hold that there are parametric points of variation between languages, although heated debate occurs over whether UG constraints are essentially universal due to being "hard-wired" (Chomsky's [[principles and parameters]] approach), a [[logical consequence]] of a specific syntactic architecture (the [[GPSG|generalized phrase structure]] approach) or the result of functional constraints on communication (the [[systemic functional linguistics|functionalist]] approach).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mark C. Baker |chapter=Syntax |title=The Handbook of Linguistics |editor=Mark Aronoff |editor2=Janie Rees-Miller |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |year=2003 |isbn=978-1-4051-0252-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relation to the evolution of language ==

In an article titled, "The Faculty of Language: What Is It, Who Has It, and How Did It Evolve?"&lt;ref name="Hauser"&gt;{{Citation | last = Hauser | first = Marc | last2 = Chomsky | first2 = Noam | author2-link = Noam Chomsky | last3 = Fitch | first3 = William Tecumseh | author3-link = W. Tecumseh Fitch | title = The Faculty of Language:  What Is It, Who Has It, and How Did It Evolve? | journal = Science | volume = 298 | pages = 1569–1579 | date = 22 November 2002 | url = http://www.chomsky.info/articles/20021122.pdf | doi = 10.1126/science.298.5598.1569 | pmid = 12446899 | issue = 5598 | access-date = 28 December 2013 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131228122250/http://www.chomsky.info/articles/20021122.pdf | archive-date = 28 December 2013 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hauser, Chomsky, and Fitch present the three leading hypotheses for how language evolved and brought humans to the point where they have a universal grammar.

The first hypothesis states that the faculty of language in the broad sense (FLb) is strictly homologous to animal communication.
This means that homologous aspects of the faculty of language exist in non-human animals.

The second hypothesis states that the FLb is a derived, uniquely human, adaptation for language. This hypothesis holds that individual traits were subject to natural selection and came to be specialized for humans.

The third hypothesis states that only the faculty of language in the narrow sense (FLn) is unique to humans. It holds that while mechanisms of the FLb are present in both human and non-human animals, the computational mechanism of recursion is recently evolved solely in humans.&lt;ref name="Hauser" /&gt; This is the hypothesis which most closely aligns to the typical theory of universal grammar championed by Chomsky.

== History ==
The idea of a universal grammar can be traced back to [[Roger Bacon]]'s observations in his {{circa|lk=no|1245}} ''[[Overview of Grammar]]'' and {{circa|lk=no|1268}} ''[[Grammatica Graeca|Greek Grammar]]'' that all languages are built upon a common grammar, even though it may undergo incidental variations; and the 13th century [[speculative grammar]]ians who, following Bacon, postulated universal rules underlying all grammars. The concept of a universal grammar or language was at the core of the 17th century projects for [[philosophical language]]s. There is a Scottish school of universal grammarians from the 18th century, as distinguished from the philosophical language project, which included authors such as [[James Beattie (writer)|James Beattie]], [[Hugh Blair]], [[James Burnett]], [[James Harris (grammarian)|James Harris]], and [[Adam Smith]]. The article on grammar in the first edition of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' (1771) contains an extensive section titled "Of Universal Grammar".

The idea rose to prominence and influence, in modern linguistics with theories from Chomsky and Montague in the 1950s–1970s, as part of the "[[linguistics wars]]".

During the early 20th century, in contrast, language was usually understood from a [[behaviourist]] perspective, suggesting that language acquisition, like any other kind of learning, could be explained by a succession of trials, errors, and rewards for success.&lt;ref name=toolmodule&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, children learned their mother tongue by simple imitation, through listening and repeating what adults said.  For example, when a child says "milk" and the mother will smile and give her some as a result, the child will find this outcome rewarding, thus enhancing the child's language development.&lt;ref&gt;Ambridge &amp; Lieven, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chomsky's theory ==

{{further|Language acquisition device|Generative grammar|X-bar theory|Government and binding|Principles and parameters|Minimalist program}}
Chomsky argued that the [[human brain]] contains a limited set of constraints for organizing language. This implies in turn that all languages have a common structural basis: the set of rules known as "universal grammar".

Speakers proficient in a language know which expressions are acceptable in their language and which are unacceptable. The key puzzle is how speakers come to know these restrictions of their language, since expressions that violate those restrictions are not present in the input, indicated as such. Chomsky argued that this [[poverty of stimulus]] means that Skinner's behaviourist perspective cannot explain language acquisition. The absence of negative evidence—evidence that an expression is part of a class of ungrammatical sentences in a given language—is the core of his argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/static/5007/sasspdf/whatexactlyisUG.pdf|title=What exactly is Universal Grammar, and has anyone seen it?|last=Northumbria University|first=Ewa Dąbrowska|date=|website=www.northumbria.ac.uk|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in English, an interrogative pronoun like ''what'' cannot be related to a predicate within a relative clause:

: *"What did John meet a man who sold?"

Such expressions are not available to language learners: they are, by hypothesis, ungrammatical. Speakers of the local language do not use them, or note them as unacceptable to language learners. Universal grammar offers an explanation for the presence of the poverty of the stimulus, by making certain restrictions into universal characteristics of human languages. Language learners are consequently never tempted to generalize in an illicit fashion.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

== Presence of creole languages ==

The presence of [[creole language]]s is sometimes cited as further support for this theory, especially by [[Derek Bickerton|Bickerton's]] controversial [[language bioprogram theory]]. Creoles are languages that develop and form when disparate societies come together and are forced to devise a new system of communication. The system used by the original speakers is typically an inconsistent mix of vocabulary items, known as a [[pidgin]]. As these speakers' children begin to acquire their first language, they use the pidgin input to effectively create their own original language, known as a [[Creole language|creole]]. Unlike pidgins, creoles have [[native speaker]]s (those with acquisition from early childhood) and make use of a full, systematic grammar.

According to Bickerton, the idea of universal grammar is supported by creole languages because certain features are shared by virtually all in the category. For example, their default point of reference in time (expressed by bare verb stems) is not the present moment, but the past. Using pre-verbal [[auxiliary verb|auxiliaries]], they uniformly express [[grammatical tense|tense]], [[grammatical aspect|aspect]], and [[grammatical mood|mood]]. [[Negative concord]] occurs, but it affects the verbal subject (as opposed to the object, as it does in languages like [[Spanish language|Spanish]]). Another similarity among creoles can be seen in the fact that questions are created simply by changing the intonation of a declarative sentence, not its word order or content.

However, extensive work by Carla Hudson-Kam and Elissa Newport suggests that creole languages may not support a universal grammar at all. In a series of experiments, Hudson-Kam and Newport looked at how children and adults learn artificial grammars. They found that children tend to ignore minor variations in the input when those variations are infrequent, and reproduce only the most frequent forms. In doing so, they tend to standardize the language that they hear around them. Hudson-Kam and Newport hypothesize that in a pidgin-development situation (and in the real-life situation of a deaf child whose parents are or were disfluent signers), children systematize the language they hear, based on the probability and frequency of forms, and not that which has been suggested on the basis of a universal grammar.&lt;ref name="Kam"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hudson Kam | first1 = C.

Many researchers of universal grammar argue against a concept of [[relexification]], which says that a language replaces its lexicon almost entirely with that of another. This goes against universalist ideas of a universal grammar, which has an innate grammar.

== Criticisms ==
[[Geoffrey Sampson]] maintains that universal grammar theories are not [[falsifiable]] and are therefore [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]]. He argues that the grammatical "rules" linguists posit are simply post-hoc observations about existing languages, rather than predictions about what is possible in a language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sampson |first=Geoffrey |year=2005 |title=The 'Language Instinct' Debate: Revised Edition |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=978-0-8264-7385-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Jeffrey Elman]] argues that the unlearnability of languages assumed by universal grammar is based on a too-strict, "worst-case" model of grammar, that is not in keeping with any actual grammar. In keeping with these points, James Hurford argues that the postulate of a [[language acquisition device]] (LAD) essentially amounts to the trivial claim that languages are learnt by humans, and thus, that the LAD is less a theory than an [[explanandum]] looking for theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=James R. Hurford |chapter=Nativist and Functional Explanations in Language Acquisition |editor=I. M. Roca |title=Logical Issues in Language Acquisition |publisher=Foris Publications |location=Dordrecht, Holland and Providence, Rhode Island |year=1995 |page=88 |url=http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~jim/rocapaper.pdf |accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Morten H. Christiansen]] and Nick Chater have argued that the relatively fast-changing nature of language would prevent the slower-changing genetic structures from ever catching up, undermining the possibility of a genetically hard-wired universal grammar. Instead of an innate universal grammar, they claim, "apparently arbitrary aspects of linguistic structure may result from general learning and processing biases deriving from the structure of thought processes, perceptuo-motor factors, cognitive limitations, and pragmatics".&lt;ref name="Christiansen, Morten H 2008"&gt;Christiansen, Morten H. and [[Chater, Nick]]. "Language as Shaped by the Brain". ''Behavioral and Brain Sciences'', 31.5 (2008): 489–509.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hinzen summarizes the most common criticisms of universal grammar:
* Universal grammar has no coherent formulation and is indeed unnecessary.
* Universal grammar is in conflict with biology: it cannot have evolved by standardly accepted [[Neo-Darwinism|neo-Darwinian]] evolutionary principles.
* There are no linguistic universals: universal grammar is refuted by abundant variation at all levels of linguistic organization, which lies at the heart of human faculty of language.&lt;ref name="Hinzen"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hinzen |first=Wolfram |title=The philosophical significance of Universal Grammar |journal=Language Sciences |volume=34 |issue=5 |date=September 2012 |pages=635–649 |doi=10.1016/j.langsci.2012.03.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, it has been suggested that people learn about probabilistic patterns of word distributions in their language, rather than hard and fast rules (see [[Distributional hypothesis]]).&lt;ref name="McDonald"&gt;{{cite journal |last=McDonald |first=Scott |last2=Ramscar |first2=Michael |year=2001 |title=Testing the distributional hypothesis: The influence of context on judgements of semantic similarity |journal=Proceedings of the 23rd Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society |pages=611–616 |accessdate=June 10, 2014 |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.104.7535}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, children overgeneralize the past tense marker "ed" and conjugate irregular verbs incorrectly, producing forms like ''goed'' and ''eated'' and correct these errors over time.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fernández |first=Eva M. |author2=Helen Smith Cairns |title=Fundamentals of Psycholinguistics |location=Chichester, West Sussex, England:  |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-4051-9147-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been proposed that the poverty of the stimulus problem can be largely avoided, if it is assumed that children employ ''similarity-based generalization'' strategies in language learning, generalizing about the usage of new words from similar words that they already know how to use.&lt;ref name="Yarlett"&gt;{{cite web |last=Yarlett |first=Daniel G. |last2=Ramscar |first2=Michael J. A. |year=2008 |title=Language Learning Through Similarity-Based Generalization|accessdate=June 10, 2014 |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.393.7298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Language acquisition]] researcher Michael Ramscar has suggested that when children erroneously expect an ungrammatical form that then never occurs, the repeated failure of expectation serves as a form of implicit [[negative feedback]] that allows them to correct their errors over time such as how children correct grammar generalizations like ''goed'' to ''went'' through repetitive failure.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ramscar"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ramscar |first=Michael |last2=Yarlett |first2=Daniel |year=2007 |title=Linguistic self-correction in the absence of feedback: A new approach to the logical problem of language acquisition |journal=Cognitive Science |volume=31 |issue=6 |pages=927–960 |doi=10.1080/03640210701703576 |pmid=21635323}}&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that word learning is a probabilistic, error-driven process, rather than a process of [[fast mapping]], as many nativists assume.

In the domain of field research, the [[Pirahã language]] is claimed to be a counterexample to the basic tenets of universal grammar. This research has been led by [[Daniel Everett]]. Among other things, this language is alleged to lack all evidence for [[recursion]], including [[Dependent clause|embedded clauses]], as well as [[Quantifier (linguistics)|quantifiers]] and [[colour]] terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Everett |first=Daniel L. |title=Cultural Constraints on Grammar and Cognition in Pirahã: Another Look at the Design Features of Human Language |journal=Current Anthropology |volume=46 |issue=4 |date=August–October 2005 |pages=621–646 |url=http://www1.icsi.berkeley.edu/~kay/Everett.CA.Piraha.pdf |doi=10.1086/431525}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the writings of Everett, the Pirahã showed these linguistic shortcomings not because they were simple-minded, but because their culture—which emphasized concrete matters in the present and also lacked creation myths and traditions of art making—did not necessitate it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Schuessler |first=Jennifer |title=How Do You Say 'Disagreement' in Pirahã? |work=The New York Times |date=March 22, 2012 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/22/books/a-new-book-and-film-about-rare-amazonian-language.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |page=C1 |accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some other linguists have argued, however, that some of these properties have been misanalyzed, and that others are actually expected under current theories of universal grammar.&lt;ref&gt;Nevins, et al., 2007 Pirahã Exceptionality: a Reassessment [http://stirling.kent.ac.uk/SE551/Week10/Nevins%20et%20al%202007%20Piraha%20Exceptionality.pdf]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521063250/http://stirling.kent.ac.uk/SE551/Week10/Nevins%20et%20al%202007%20Piraha%20Exceptionality.pdf |date=May 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other linguists have attempted to reassess Pirahã to see if it did indeed use recursion. In a corpus analysis of the Pirahã language, linguists failed to disprove Everett's arguments against universal grammar and the lack of recursion in Pirahã. However, they also stated that there was "no strong evidence for the lack of recursion either" and they provided "suggestive evidence that Pirahã may have sentences with recursive
structures".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=August 2012 |first=Steven T. |last=Piantadosi |first2=Laura |last2=Stearns |first3=Daniel L. |last3=Everett |first4=Edward |last4=Gibson |title=A corpus analysis of Pirahã grammar: An investigation of recursion |url=http://tedlab.mit.edu/tedlab_website/researchpapers/Piantadosi_et_al_2012_LSAtalk_Piraha.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daniel Everett has gone as far as claiming that universal grammar does not exist. In his words, "universal grammar doesn't seem to work, there doesn't seem to be much evidence for [it]. And what can we put in its place? A complex interplay of factors, of which culture, the values human beings share, plays a major role in structuring the way that we talk and the things that we talk about."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McCrum |first=Robert |title=Daniel Everett: 'There is no such thing as universal grammar |work=The Observer |date=March 24, 2012 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/mar/25/daniel-everett-human-language-piraha |accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Tomasello]], a developmental psychologist, also supports this claim, arguing that "although many aspects of human linguistic competence have indeed evolved biologically, specific grammatical principles and constructions have not. And universals in the grammatical structure of different languages have come from more general processes and constraints of human cognition, communication, and vocal-auditory processing, operating during the conventionalization and transmission of the particular grammatical constructions of particular linguistic communities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=[[Michael Tomasello|Tomasello]] |first=Michael |year=2008 |title=Origins of human communication |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-51520-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
